      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So we have a rectangle ABCD with BC = 24. Point X is inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles AXd and BCX are both acute and have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively. We need to find the length of AB. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me draw a rectangle ABCD. Let me label the rectangle with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So AB and CD are the bases, each of length we need to find, and BC and AD are the sides of length 24, since BC is given as 24. So BC = AD = 24, AB = CD = ?\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, and angle AXB is 90 degrees. So if I imagine point X somewhere inside the rectangle, the lines from A to X and from B to X form a right angle at X. That means triangle AXB is a right-angled triangle at X. Wait, but the problem says triangles AXD and BCX are both acute. Hmm, okay. So the triangles AXd and BCX are acute, so all their angles are less than 90 degrees. The circumradii of these triangles are given as 13 and 15 respectively. \n\nI remember that the circumradius of a triangle with sides a, b, c is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where A is the area of the triangle. Alternatively, for a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. But here, the triangles AXD and BCX are both acute, so they are not right-angled, but they do have circumradii. \n\nLet me consider coordinate geometry here. Let me place the rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me let point A be at (0, 0), so then B would be at (AB, 0), C at (AB, 24), and D at (0, 24). Let me denote AB as the variable x, which we need to find. So AB = x, so coordinates are A(0,0), B(x,0), C(x,24), D(0,24). \n\nNow, point X is inside the rectangle. Let me denote the coordinates of X as (h, k), where 0 < h < x and 0 < k < 24. \n\nGiven angle AXB is 90 degrees. The vectors AX and BX should be perpendicular. The vector AX is (h, k), and the vector BX is (h - x, k). Their dot product should be zero. So:\n\nAX \u2022 BX = h*(h - x) + k*k = 0.\n\nSo that gives the equation h\u00b2 - h x + k\u00b2 = 0. Let's note that as equation (1).\n\nNext, triangles AXD and BCX have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively. Let me first handle triangle AXD. The triangle AXD has vertices at A(0,0), X(h,k), and D(0,24). Let me compute the lengths of the sides of triangle AXD.\n\nFirst, side AX: distance from A to X is sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2).\n\nSide XD: distance from X to D is sqrt((0 - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2) = sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2).\n\nSide AD: distance from A to D is 24, since it's a side of the rectangle.\n\nWait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, so that's 24. Wait but in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, no. Wait, triangle AXD is formed by points A, X, D. So the sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, so that's correct. Wait, so triangle AXD has sides AX, XD, and AD. But AD is 24. Hmm. Wait, but if that's the case, the triangle AXD has sides of length sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2), sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2), and 24. \n\nSimilarly, triangle BCX has vertices at B(x,0), C(x,24), and X(h,k). So sides BC is 24, but the triangle sides are BC, CX, and BX. Wait, BC is from B to C which is vertical, length 24. Then CX is sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 - 0)^2 ), and BX is sqrt( (x - h)^2 + k\u00b2 ). Wait, but triangle BCX has sides BC (24), CX, and BX. Wait, but BC is one side. Hmm.\n\nWait, actually, triangle BCX: points B(x,0), C(x,24), X(h,k). The sides are:\n\n- BC: 24 units (vertical line from B to C).\n\n- BX: distance from B to X is sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (0 - k)^2 ) = sqrt( (x - h)^2 + k\u00b2 )\n\n- CX: distance from C to X is sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2 )\n\nSo triangle BCX has sides of length 24, sqrt( (x - h)^2 + k\u00b2 ), and sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2 )\n\nSimilarly, triangle AXD:\n\n- AX: sqrt( h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 )\n\n- XD: sqrt( h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 )\n\n- AD: 24 (distance from A to D which is vertical)\n\nWait, but triangle AXD's sides are AX, XD, and AD. So the sides are as above. \n\nSince both triangles are acute, all their angles are less than 90 degrees. The circumradius of a triangle is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides and A is the area. Alternatively, since all triangles here are not right-angled (they are acute), so their circumradius can be found using that formula. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula R = a/(2*sin A), where A is the angle opposite side a. Not sure which is easier here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to use coordinates to set up equations. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's start with triangle AXD. Let me denote its sides:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nIn triangle AXD,\n\nLet me call the sides:\n\nAX = sqrt(h^2 + k^2) = a,\n\nXD = sqrt(h^2 + (24 - k)^2) = b,\n\nAD = 24 = c.\n\nThen the circumradius R1 = 13 is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where A is the area of triangle AXD.\n\nSo first, Let me compute the area A of triangle AXD. Since points A(0,0), X(h,k), D(0,24). The area can be found using the determinant formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)| (0*(k - 24) + h*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - k) ) | = (1/2)|0 + 24h + 0| = (1/2)(24h) = 12h.\n\nWait, that seems right. Because the base is AD, which is vertical from (0,0) to (0,24), so length 24, and the horizontal distance from X to the line AD is h (since X is at (h,k)), so area is (base * height)/2 = (24 * h)/2 = 12h. So yes, Area A = 12h.\n\nTherefore, for triangle AXD, circumradius R1 = (a*b*c)/(4*A) = (a*b*24)/(4*12h) = (a*b*24)/(48h) = (a*b)/(2h). This is equal to 13.\n\nSo, (a*b)/(2h) = 13 => a*b = 26h.\n\nBut a is AX = sqrt(h^2 + k^2), b is XD = sqrt(h^2 + (24 - k)^2). So:\n\nsqrt(h^2 + k^2) * sqrt(h^2 + (24 - k)^2 ) = 26h.\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BCX, which has vertices B(x,0), C(x,24), X(h,k). Let's compute its sides:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nBC = 24,\n\nBX = sqrt( (x - h)^2 + k^2 ) = let's say d,\n\nCX = sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2 ) = e,\n\nSo sides are 24, d, e.\n\nThe area of triangle BCX can be calculated similarly. Let me use coordinates. The points are B(x,0), C(x,24), X(h,k). The area can be calculated using determinant:\n\nArea = (1/2)| x*(24 - k) + x*(k - 0) + h*(0 - 24) | ?\n\nWait, maybe better to use base and height. Since BC is vertical from (x,0) to (x,24), so length 24. The horizontal distance from X to BC is |x - h|. Therefore, the area is (base * height)/2 = (24 * |x - h|)/2 = 12|x - h|. Since X is inside the rectangle, h < x, so it's 12(x - h).\n\nTherefore, the area A2 = 12(x - h).\n\nThe circumradius R2 = 15 is given by:\n\nR = (d*e*c)/(4*A2), where c is BC=24, d and e are the other sides. \n\nWait, let me confirm the formula again. For triangle BCX, sides are 24, d, e. So:\n\nR2 = (d * e * 24)/(4 * 12(x - h)) ) = (d*e*24)/(48(x - h)) ) = (d*e)/(2(x - h)) = 15.\n\nTherefore, (d*e)/(2(x - h)) = 15 => d*e = 30(x - h).\n\nBut d is BX = sqrt( (x - h)^2 + k^2 ), and e is CX = sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2 ). \n\nTherefore, sqrt( (x - h)^2 + k^2 ) * sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2 ) = 30(x - h).\n\nSo now, for triangle AXD, we have equation:\n\nsqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 ) = 26h. (Equation 2)\n\nAnd for triangle BCX, we have:\n\nsqrt( (x - h)^2 + k\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2 ) = 30(x - h). (Equation 3)\n\nAdditionally, we have the equation from angle AXB = 90\u00b0, which gave us:\n\nh\u00b2 - h x + k\u00b2 = 0. (Equation 1)\n\nSo now, we have three equations (1, 2, 3) with variables h, k, and x. We need to solve these equations to find x = AB.\n\nThis seems complex, but maybe we can find a way to simplify these equations. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let me note that equations 2 and 3 have a similar structure. Let me consider equation 2:\n\nsqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 ) = 26h.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2) = (26h)^2 = 676h\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly for equation 3:\n\nsqrt( (x - h)^2 + k\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2 ) = 30(x - h).\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n[ (x - h)^2 + k\u00b2 ] [ (x - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2 ] = [30(x - h)]^2 = 900(x - h)^2.\n\nSo perhaps if we can denote some variables to simplify these expressions.\n\nLet me first work on equation 1: h\u00b2 - h x + k\u00b2 = 0 => h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h x. (Equation 1a)\n\nThis is useful. Let me note that h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h x. So in equation 2, the first term (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) is equal to h x. Let me substitute that into equation 2's left-hand side.\n\nEquation 2's left side is (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 ) = (h x) [ h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 ]\n\nSo setting that equal to 676 h\u00b2:\n\nh x [ h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 ] = 676 h\u00b2.\n\nAssuming h \u2260 0 (since X is inside the rectangle, h can't be 0), we can divide both sides by h:\n\nx [ h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 ] = 676 h.\n\nSimilarly, for equation 3, let me see if we can use equation 1a here. Let me see:\n\nEquation 3, after squaring, is:\n\n[ (x - h)^2 + k\u00b2 ] [ (x - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2 ] = 900(x - h)^2.\n\nHmm, not sure if equation 1a can help here yet, but let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that equation 1a gives h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h x. Maybe we can express k\u00b2 in terms of h and x: k\u00b2 = h x - h\u00b2. Then substitute into equations 2 and 3.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFirst, let's consider equation 2's left side:\n\n(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 )\n\nWe know h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h x, so first term is h x.\n\nSecond term: h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 = h\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 - 48k + k\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) + 24\u00b2 - 48k = h x + 576 - 48k.\n\nTherefore, the entire left side of equation 2 is h x [ h x + 576 - 48k ] = 676 h\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by h (assuming h \u2260 0):\n\nx [ h x + 576 - 48k ] = 676 h.\n\nHmm, that gives an equation involving x, h, and k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find expressions for variables in terms of others.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of equation 1a: h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h x.\n\nLet me note that (24 - k)^2 = 24\u00b2 -48k +k\u00b2 = 24\u00b2 -48k + (h x - h\u00b2). Since k\u00b2 = h x - h\u00b2 from equation 1a.\n\nSo (24 -k)^2 = 576 -48k + h x - h\u00b2. Hmm, but perhaps this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider variables substitution. Let me let a = h and b = k. Then we can write equations in terms of a and b. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there is symmetry between equations 2 and 3. Let me consider equations 2 and 3 again.\n\nEquation 2: sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)*sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24\u2212k)^2 ) =26h.\n\nEquation 3: sqrt( (x\u2212h)^2 +k\u00b2 )*sqrt( (x\u2212h)^2 + (24\u2212k)^2 ) =30(x\u2212h).\n\nThese equations resemble each other. Let me denote in equation 2: Let me set u = h and v = 24 - k. Then equation 2's left side becomes sqrt(u\u00b2 + (24 - v)^2 ) * sqrt(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 ) ?\n\nWait, maybe that complicates. Alternatively, note that equations 2 and 3 have similar forms with variables h and x - h. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote t = x - h. Since h < x, t is positive.\n\nSo, in equation 3, (x - h) is t, so equation 3 becomes sqrt(t\u00b2 +k\u00b2)*sqrt(t\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) = 30 t.\n\nSimilarly, equation 2 is sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)*sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =26 h.\n\nSo, equations 2 and 3 are similar but with h and t. Let me denote that:\n\nLet me define for equation 2: Let m = h, so equation 2 is sqrt(m\u00b2 + k\u00b2)*sqrt(m\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =26 m.\n\nFor equation 3, let n = t = x - h, so equation 3 is sqrt(n\u00b2 + k\u00b2)*sqrt(n\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =30 n.\n\nTherefore, both equations have the same structure with variables m and n, and k. \n\nWait, but in equation 2, the variables are m = h and k, while in equation 3, variables are n = x - h and the same k. \n\nHmm, perhaps if we can consider the general form of such an equation.\n\nSuppose we have sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * sqrt(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2 ) = k * a,\n\nwhere c is a constant (here, c =24), and a is a variable (either h or t), and b is another variable (k here). \n\nPerhaps there's a way to solve for a in terms of b?\n\nAlternatively, maybe if I can set variables such that the equations can be related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider that the product sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*sqrt(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2) can be simplified.\n\nLet me compute the product:\n\nsqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * sqrt(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2) = sqrt{ [a\u00b2 + b\u00b2][a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2] }.\n\nLet me compute the product inside:\n\nLet me denote the product inside the square root as P = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2).\n\nExpand this:\n\nFirst, expand (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2):\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nLet me denote term1 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2,\n\nterm2 = a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2 = a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2cb + b\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, P = term1 * term2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2cb + b\u00b2).\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nMultiply term1 * term2:\n\n= a\u00b2(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2cb + b\u00b2) + b\u00b2(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2cb + b\u00b2)\n\n= a^4 + a\u00b2c\u00b2 - 2 a\u00b2 b c + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 + a\u00b2 b\u00b2 + b\u00b2 c\u00b2 - 2 b^3 c + b^4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n= a^4 + a\u00b2c\u00b2 - 2 a\u00b2b c + 2a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b^4 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 - 2b^3 c\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can write (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2) as [a^2]^2 + a^2[(c - b)^2 + b^2] + [b^2][(c - b)^2] ?\n\nWait, perhaps instead of expanding, think of variables substitution. Let me see:\n\nLet me set s = b, so term is (a\u00b2 + s\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - s)^2).\n\nAlternatively, maybe set t = s - c/2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that if we let variable substitution to make the expression symmetric. Let me see:\n\nLet me see if the product (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2) can be expressed in terms of (b + (c - b))?\n\nWait, b + (c - b) = c, so that might not help. Alternatively, maybe consider that the terms are symmetric around b = c/2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of expanding, think of the product as:\n\nLet me think of (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2) = [a\u00b2 + b\u00b2][a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2].\n\nLet me denote d = c - b, so that term becomes [a\u00b2 + (c - d)^2][a\u00b2 + d^2], but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that:\n\nLet me denote the term P = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2).\n\nThen, let me see if we can write P = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2) = (a\u00b2)^2 + a\u00b2[(c - b)^2 + b\u00b2] + b\u00b2(c - b)^2.\n\nWait:\n\nFirst term: a^4,\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2[(c - b)^2 + b\u00b2] = a\u00b2[c\u00b2 - 2bc + b\u00b2 + b\u00b2] = a\u00b2[c\u00b2 - 2bc + 2b\u00b2]\n\nThird term: b\u00b2(c - b)^2 = b\u00b2(c\u00b2 - 2bc + b\u00b2).\n\nSo overall,\n\nP = a^4 + a\u00b2(c\u00b2 - 2bc + 2b\u00b2) + b\u00b2(c\u00b2 - 2bc + b\u00b2).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the expression as (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2) = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2) = (a\u00b2)^2 + a\u00b2[(c - b)^2 + b\u00b2] + [b^2][(c - b)^2]\n\nWait, but perhaps there's a geometric interpretation here. Since in equations 2 and 3, these products represent the product of the lengths of two sides of a triangle?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the expression sqrt[(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2)] as the geometric mean of the two terms. But perhaps this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to find a relationship between h and t = x - h?\n\nLet me note that in equation 1a: h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h x. Since t = x - h, then x = h + t. So substituting into equation 1a:\n\nh\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h (h + t) => h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h\u00b2 + h t => k\u00b2 = h t.\n\nTherefore, k squared equals h times t. So k = sqrt(h t). Since k is positive (as a coordinate inside the rectangle), we can write k = sqrt(h t). That's an important relation.\n\nTherefore, equation connecting h and t: k = sqrt(h t). (Equation 4)\n\nSo that gives us a relation between h and t (since t = x - h). \n\nTherefore, we can express k in terms of h and t. This might help in substituting into equations 2 and 3.\n\nLet me see equations 2 and 3 again:\n\nEquation 2 (after substitution):\n\nsqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2)*sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 ) =26 h.\n\nBut since h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h x = h(h + t) = h\u00b2 + h t (since x = h + t). Wait, but h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h x, which is given by equation 1a. Therefore, sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) is sqrt(h x). \n\nWait, equation 2's left side is sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)*sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) = sqrt(h x) * sqrt( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nBut since we also have k\u00b2 = h t, so k = sqrt(h t). Let me see if we can express (24 - k)^2 in terms of h and t.\n\n(24 - k)^2 = 24\u00b2 - 48k + k\u00b2 = 576 - 48 sqrt(h t) + h t.\n\nHmm, but this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps proceed step by step.\n\nLet me try to rewrite equation 2 using equation 1a and equation 4.\n\nFirst equation 2:\n\nsqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 ) =26 h.\n\nFrom equation 1a, sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) = sqrt(h x). \n\nTherefore, equation 2 becomes sqrt(h x) * sqrt( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =26 h.\n\nDivide both sides by sqrt(h x):\n\nsqrt( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =26 h / sqrt(h x) =26 sqrt(h / x).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nh\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 = (26)^2 * (h / x )\n\nSimilarly, equation 3:\n\nsqrt( t\u00b2 + k\u00b2 ) * sqrt( t\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =30 t.\n\nHere, t = x - h. Let me note that k\u00b2 = h t from equation 4, so sqrt(t\u00b2 + k\u00b2) = sqrt(t\u00b2 + h t).\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(t\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2) is similar to before.\n\nSo equation 3 becomes sqrt(t\u00b2 + h t) * sqrt(t\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =30 t.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[ t\u00b2 + h t ] [ t\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ] =900 t\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but perhaps we can use equation 4 again here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to express (24 - k)^2 in terms of h and t.\n\nFrom equation 4, k = sqrt(h t). Therefore, (24 -k)^2 = 24\u00b2 -48 sqrt(h t) + h t.\n\nTherefore, in equation 2's squared version:\n\nLeft side after squaring was h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 = h\u00b2 + 576 -48 sqrt(h t) + h t.\n\nSet equal to (26)^2 * (h/x):\n\nSo:\n\nh\u00b2 + 576 -48 sqrt(h t) + h t = (676)(h/x)\n\nSimilarly, since x = h + t, so h/x = h/(h + t). Therefore,\n\nh\u00b2 + 576 -48 sqrt(h t) + h t = (676 h )/(h + t )\n\nThis is getting complicated, but perhaps substituting variables would help. Let me set s = sqrt(h t). Since k = s, from equation 4, since k = sqrt(h t). Wait, equation 4 says k = sqrt(h t). So s = k.\n\nTherefore, s = k.\n\nTherefore, h t = s\u00b2. \n\nSo, let me write variables in terms of s, h, t. Wait, but still three variables. Maybe set variables as h and t, with s = sqrt(h t). Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps instead let me set variables as h and t, then express everything in terms of h and t.\n\nGiven that s = sqrt(h t) = k,\n\nLet me rewrite equation 2's squared equation:\n\nLeft side: h\u00b2 + (24 - s)^2 = h\u00b2 + 576 -48 s + s\u00b2.\n\nRight side: (676 h ) / (h + t).\n\nTherefore:\n\nh\u00b2 + 576 -48 s + s\u00b2 = (676 h)/(h + t).\n\nBut s\u00b2 = h t, so substitute s\u00b2 = h t:\n\nh\u00b2 + 576 -48 s + h t = (676 h)/(h + t).\n\nHmm, so left side becomes h\u00b2 + h t + 576 -48 s. Since h t = s\u00b2,\n\nh\u00b2 + s\u00b2 + 576 -48 s = (676 h)/(h + t).\n\nBut h + t = x, so denominator is x.\n\nHmm, not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe work with equation 3 as well. Let me process equation 3 similarly.\n\nEquation 3 after squaring:\n\n[ t\u00b2 + h t ] [ t\u00b2 + (24 - s)^2 ] = 900 t\u00b2.\n\nAgain, (24 - s)^2 = 24\u00b2 -48 s + s\u00b2 =576 -48 s + s\u00b2,\n\nTherefore, the left side becomes:\n\n(t\u00b2 + h t)( t\u00b2 +576 -48 s + s\u00b2 )\n\nAgain, s\u00b2 = h t, so substitute:\n\n(t\u00b2 + h t)( t\u00b2 +576 -48 s + h t )\n\n= (t(t + h )) [ t\u00b2 + h t + 576 -48 s ]\n\nHmm, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps expand the terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find another way. Let me think again.\n\nWe have equation 1a: h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h x.\n\nEquation 4: k\u00b2 = h t, where t = x - h.\n\nSo substituting equation 4 into equation 1a gives h\u00b2 + h t = h x => h (h + t) = h x. Since h + t = x (since t = x - h), this is just an identity. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, equations 2 and 3 are the key ones. Let me see if I can find a relation between equations 2 and 3.\n\nLet me look at equation 2 and 3 again, in terms of h and t.\n\nEquation 2 (after substitution):\n\nsqrt(h x) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =26 h.\n\nSimilarly, equation 3:\n\nsqrt(t\u00b2 + k\u00b2 ) * sqrt(t\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =30 t.\n\nLet me denote (24 -k)^2 as Q, so Q = (24 -k)^2.\n\nThen, equation 2 becomes sqrt(h x) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + Q ) =26 h.\n\nEquation 3: sqrt(t\u00b2 + k\u00b2 ) * sqrt(t\u00b2 + Q ) =30 t.\n\nNote that sqrt(h x) = sqrt( h (h + t) ), and sqrt(t\u00b2 + k\u00b2) = sqrt(t\u00b2 + h t) since k\u00b2 = h t.\n\nSo equation 2 can be written as sqrt( h (h + t) ) * sqrt( h\u00b2 + Q ) =26 h,\n\nand equation 3 as sqrt( t (t + h) ) * sqrt( t\u00b2 + Q ) =30 t.\n\nHmm, perhaps if I divide equation 2 by equation 1's sqrt(h x):\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, let me write equations 2 and 3 in terms of h and t:\n\nLet me define Q = (24 -k)^2 = (24 - sqrt(h t))^2.\n\nThis seems messy, but perhaps we can find a ratio between equations 2 and 3?\n\nLet me see:\n\nEquation 2:\n\nsqrt( h (h + t) ) * sqrt( h\u00b2 + Q ) =26 h,\n\nEquation 3:\n\nsqrt( t (t + h) ) * sqrt( t\u00b2 + Q ) =30 t,\n\nLet me divide equation 2 by equation 3:\n\n[sqrt( h (h + t) ) * sqrt( h\u00b2 + Q ) ] / [sqrt( t (t + h) ) * sqrt( t\u00b2 + Q ) ] = (26 h)/(30 t)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nsqrt(h (h + t)/ (t (h + t)) ) * sqrt( (h\u00b2 + Q)/(t\u00b2 + Q) )\n\n= sqrt( h/t ) * sqrt( (h\u00b2 + Q)/(t\u00b2 + Q) )\n\nTherefore,\n\nsqrt( h/t * (h\u00b2 + Q)/(t\u00b2 + Q) ) ) = (26 h)/(30 t )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n( h/t * (h\u00b2 + Q)/(t\u00b2 + Q) ) = (26 h /30 t )\u00b2 = (26^2 h\u00b2)/(30^2 t\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by t\u00b2 (t\u00b2 + Q):\n\nh (h\u00b2 + Q) (t\u00b2 + Q) = (26^2 h\u00b2)/(30^2) * t (t\u00b2 + Q)\n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe this approach isn't the best.\n\nPerhaps another approach. Let me consider that in both equations 2 and 3, the expressions involve sqrt(a\u00b2 + k\u00b2)*sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2) equals to some multiple of a, where a is h or t.\n\nLet me suppose that for some general a, sqrt(a\u00b2 + k\u00b2)*sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2) = m * a, then perhaps m is related to the circumradius?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that expression squared is equal to (m a)^2.\n\nLet me consider the general case where sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*sqrt(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2) = m a,\n\nthen squaring gives (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2) = m\u00b2 a\u00b2,\n\nthen, expanding the left side as earlier:\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (c - b)^2) = a^4 + a\u00b2[(c - b)^2 + b\u00b2] + b\u00b2(c - b)^2\n\n= a^4 + a\u00b2[c\u00b2 - 2b c + 2b\u00b2] + b\u00b2(c\u00b2 - 2b c + b\u00b2)\n\nSo, set equal to m\u00b2 a\u00b2,\n\nthen:\n\na^4 + a\u00b2[c\u00b2 - 2b c + 2b\u00b2] + b\u00b2(c\u00b2 - 2b c + b\u00b2) - m\u00b2 a\u00b2 = 0\n\nHmm, but unless there is a specific relationship between a and b, this is a quartic equation. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe make a substitution such as letting b = kc, where k is some fraction?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that a and t are related in some way, like proportional?\n\nAlternatively, maybe look for specific substitutions.\n\nWait, in equation 1a, we have h x = h\u00b2 + k\u00b2,\n\nand in equation 4, k\u00b2 = h t,\n\nso h x = h\u00b2 + h t,\n\nwhich gives x = h + t, which is consistent with t = x - h.\n\nSo that's just confirming t = x - h.\n\nLet me consider that equations 2 and 3 can be written as:\n\nEquation 2 squared:\n\n(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2) = (26 h)^2,\n\nEquation 3 squared:\n\n(t\u00b2 + k\u00b2)(t\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2) = (30 t)^2,\n\nBut since k\u00b2 = h t,\n\nso substituting k\u00b2 = h t,\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n\n(h\u00b2 + h t)(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2) = 676 h\u00b2,\n\nEquation 3 becomes:\n\n(t\u00b2 + h t)(t\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2) = 900 t\u00b2,\n\nHmm, perhaps denote (24 -k)^2 = let me see, k = sqrt(h t), so (24 - sqrt(h t))^2 = 24\u00b2 - 48 sqrt(h t) + h t. \n\nTherefore, in equation 2:\n\nLeft side first term is h\u00b2 + h t,\n\nSecond term is h\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 -48 sqrt(h t) + h t,\n\nSo overall,\n\nLeft side = (h\u00b2 + h t)[h\u00b2 + h t + 576 -48 sqrt(h t) ]\n\n= (h(h + t)) [ h(h + t) + 576 -48 sqrt(h t) ]\n\nLet me denote S = sqrt(h t) = k,\n\nthen the expression becomes:\n\nh(h + t) [ h(h + t) + 576 -48 S ]\n\nBut since S = sqrt(h t), and h + t = x,\n\nWait, but h(h + t) = h x,\n\nand S = sqrt(h t),\n\nSo substituting,\n\nLeft Side = h x [ h x + 576 -48 S ]\n\nSet equal to 676 h\u00b2,\n\nThus:\n\nh x (h x + 576 -48 S ) = 676 h\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by h (assuming h \u22600):\n\nx (h x + 576 -48 S ) = 676 h,\n\nSimilarly, equation 3 can be expressed as:\n\nt ( t x + 576 -48 S ) = 900 t,\n\nWait, let me do the same steps for equation 3.\n\nEquation 3 squared:\n\n(t\u00b2 + h t)(t\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) = 900 t\u00b2,\n\nAgain, t\u00b2 + h t = t(t + h) = t x,\n\nand (24 -k)^2 = 576 -48 S + h t,\n\ntherefore,\n\nLeft side: t x [ t x + 576 -48 S ]\n\nSo,\n\nt x (t x + 576 -48 S ) = 900 t\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by t (assuming t \u22600):\n\nx (t x + 576 -48 S ) = 900 t,\n\nSo now equations 2 and 3 become:\n\nEquation 2a: x (h x + 576 -48 S ) = 676 h,\n\nEquation 3a: x (t x + 576 -48 S ) = 900 t,\n\nWhere S = sqrt(h t).\n\nAlso, since x = h + t,\n\nLet me substitute x = h + t into these equations.\n\nFirst, Equation 2a:\n\nx = h + t,\n\nso,\n\n(h + t)( h (h + t) + 576 -48 S ) =676 h,\n\nSimilarly, Equation 3a:\n\n(h + t)( t (h + t ) + 576 -48 S ) = 900 t,\n\nThis still seems quite involved, but maybe we can find a substitution here.\n\nLet me denote S = sqrt(h t).\n\nLet me also note that S\u00b2 = h t.\n\nAlso, let me denote u = h + t = x,\n\nand v = h t = S\u00b2,\n\nso that h and t are roots of the quadratic equation z\u00b2 - u z + v =0,\n\nsince h + t = u, and h t = v.\n\nSo, perhaps expressing equations in terms of u and v.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet u = x = h + t,\n\nv = h t,\n\nand S = sqrt(v).\n\nEquation 2a becomes:\n\nu ( h u + 576 -48 S ) =676 h,\n\nEquation 3a becomes:\n\nu ( t u +576 -48 S ) =900 t,\n\nLet me rewrite equation 2a:\n\nu ( h u +576 -48 S ) =676 h,\n\nExpand the left side:\n\nu^2 h + 576 u -48 u S =676 h,\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nu\u00b2 h +576 u -48 u S -676 h =0,\n\nSimilarly, equation 3a:\n\nu (t u +576 -48 S ) =900 t,\n\nExpanding:\n\nu\u00b2 t +576 u -48 u S =900 t,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nu\u00b2 t +576 u -48 u S -900 t =0,\n\nNow, since h and t are variables, but we can express equations in terms of h and t.\n\nBut perhaps if we can write these equations as linear in h and t.\n\nLet me think of equation 2a rearranged:\n\n(u\u00b2 -676) h +576 u -48 u S =0,\n\nSimilarly, equation 3a:\n\n(u\u00b2 -900) t +576 u -48 u S =0,\n\nHmm, interesting. Both equations have the same terms 576 u -48 u S. Let me denote this as a common term:\n\nLet me set C =576 u -48 u S,\n\nthen equation 2a becomes:\n\n(u\u00b2 -676) h + C =0,\n\nequation 3a becomes:\n\n(u\u00b2 -900) t + C =0,\n\nTherefore,\n\nFrom equation 2a: h = -C/(u\u00b2 -676),\n\nFrom equation 3a: t = -C/(u\u00b2 -900),\n\nTherefore, h and t are expressed in terms of C and u.\n\nBut since h and t are positive real numbers (since they are coordinates inside the rectangle), the denominators must have appropriate signs.\n\nAlso, since h + t = u, so:\n\nh + t = -C/(u\u00b2 -676) + (-C)/(u\u00b2 -900) = u,\n\nThus,\n\n-C [1/(u\u00b2 -676) + 1/(u\u00b2 -900) ] = u,\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n-C [ (u\u00b2 -900 + u\u00b2 -676 ) / ( (u\u00b2 -676)(u\u00b2 -900) ) ) ] = u,\n\nSimplify numerator inside the brackets:\n\n(2u\u00b2 -1576) / denominator.\n\nThus,\n\n-C*(2u\u00b2 -1576)/[ (u\u00b2 -676)(u\u00b2 -900) ) ] = u,\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n-C*(2u\u00b2 -1576) = u (u\u00b2 -676)(u\u00b2 -900),\n\nHmm, this is getting very involved.\n\nAlternatively, since h and t are expressed in terms of C and u,\n\nand also,\n\nsince h t = v = S\u00b2,\n\nthen,\n\nh * t = [ -C/(u\u00b2 -676) ] * [ -C/(u\u00b2 -900) ] = C\u00b2 / [ (u\u00b2 -676)(u\u00b2 -900) ) ] = S\u00b2.\n\nBut S = sqrt(v) = sqrt(h t) = sqrt(S\u00b2) = S,\n\nWait, that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, since h * t = v,\n\nand h t = C\u00b2 / [ (u\u00b2 -676)(u\u00b2 -900) ) ] = v,\n\nBut v = h t,\n\nSo,\n\nv = C\u00b2 / [ (u\u00b2 -676)(u\u00b2 -900) ) ]\n\nTherefore,\n\nC\u00b2 = v (u\u00b2 -676)(u\u00b2 -900).\n\nBut C =576 u -48 u S,\n\nso,\n\n(576 u -48 u S )\u00b2 = v (u\u00b2 -676)(u\u00b2 -900).\n\nHmm, this is a complicated equation involving u and S, but S = sqrt(v) = sqrt(h t).\n\nSince v = h t,\n\nand u = h + t,\n\nSo, perhaps this can be expressed in terms of u and v.\n\nLet me denote S = sqrt(v),\n\nthen,\n\n(576 u -48 u sqrt(v) )\u00b2 = v (u\u00b2 -676)(u\u00b2 -900).\n\nThis equation is in terms of u and v. But since v = h t, and u = h + t,\n\nmaybe we can use the relationship between u and v for two variables h and t. For two variables with sum u and product v,\n\nthe maximum and possible values are constrained by the discriminant of the quadratic equation,\n\nbut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this equation can be simplified.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n(576 u -48 u sqrt(v) )\u00b2 = (48 u)^2 (12 - sqrt(v))^2 = 2304 u\u00b2 (144 - 24 sqrt(v) + v).\n\nWait,\n\nWait, actually:\n\nWait,\n\nWait, 576 u = 48*12 u,\n\n48 u sqrt(v) is as is,\n\nso,\n\n(576 u -48 u sqrt(v))^2 = [48 u (12 - sqrt(v))]^2 = (48 u)^2 (12 - sqrt(v))^2.\n\nYes, so that's 48\u00b2 u\u00b2 (12 - sqrt(v))^2,\n\nSo left side is 2304 u\u00b2 (144 -24 sqrt(v) + v).\n\nRight side is v (u\u00b2 -676)(u\u00b2 -900).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated, but perhaps we can make a substitution. Let me set w = sqrt(v). Then v = w\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nLeft side: 2304 u\u00b2 (144 - 24 w + w\u00b2),\n\nRight side: w\u00b2 (u\u00b2 -676)(u\u00b2 -900).\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to assume some integer values for u (since the answer is likely an integer given the circumradii are 13 and 15, which are integers). Maybe u is an integer, so x = u is an integer. Let me check possible values.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem involves circumradius 13 and 15, which are part of Pythagorean triples (like 5-12-13, 9-12-15, etc.), maybe there's a Pythagorean triplet involved here.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of equations 2 and 3 again.\n\nLet me consider equations 2 and 3 in terms of h and t.\n\nEquation 2 squared:\n\n(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) = (26h)^2,\n\nBut since k\u00b2 = h t,\n\nthis becomes (h\u00b2 + h t)(h\u00b2 + (24 - sqrt(h t))^2 ) =676 h\u00b2,\n\nSimilarly, equation 3 squared:\n\n(t\u00b2 + h t)(t\u00b2 + (24 - sqrt(h t))^2 ) =900 t\u00b2,\n\nHmm, perhaps if I let sqrt(h t) = s,\n\nthen s\u00b2 = h t,\n\nand equations become:\n\n(h\u00b2 + s\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 - s)^2 ) =676 h\u00b2,\n\nand,\n\n(t\u00b2 + s\u00b2)(t\u00b2 + (24 - s)^2 ) =900 t\u00b2,\n\nSo now, variables are h, t, s, with s\u00b2 = h t,\n\nand h + t = x.\n\nPerhaps this substitution simplifies things.\n\nLet me write equations in terms of s.\n\nFirst, since s\u00b2 = h t,\n\nthen h = s\u00b2 / t,\n\nand t = s\u00b2 / h.\n\nSo, substituting h = s\u00b2 / t into the first equation,\n\nEquation 2 becomes:\n\n( (s^4 / t\u00b2 ) + s\u00b2 ) [ (s^4 / t\u00b2 ) + (24 - s)^2 ) ] =676*(s^4 / t\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that s is an integer. Since 13 and 15 are integers, maybe s is also an integer. Let me see.\n\nSuppose s is an integer. Let me try some values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the problem in terms of coordinate geometry with the right angle at X.\n\nSince angle AXB is 90\u00b0, point X lies on the circle with diameter AB. Wait, but AB is the side of the rectangle, which is horizontal from (0,0) to (x,0). Wait, no. If angle AXB is 90\u00b0, then X lies on the circle with diameter AB. Because in a rectangle, the circle with diameter AB would have its center at the midpoint of AB, which is (x/2, 0), and radius x/2. But the problem states that X is inside the rectangle, so maybe this can help.\n\nWait, but in a rectangle, the circle with diameter AB would have equation (X - x/2)^2 + Y^2 = (x/2)^2. But since Y coordinate of X is k, which is between 0 and 24, so for X to lie on that circle,\n\n(h - x/2)^2 + k\u00b2 = (x/2)^2,\n\nExpanding,\n\nh\u00b2 - x h + (x\u00b2)/4 + k\u00b2 = x\u00b2/4,\n\nThus,\n\nh\u00b2 + k\u00b2 -x h =0,\n\nWhich is exactly equation 1: h\u00b2 -x h +k\u00b2 =0. So yes, that's consistent. So point X lies on the circle with diameter AB, which is centered at (x/2, 0) with radius x/2.\n\nHmm, so that's a good check.\n\nTherefore, we can think of point X lying on that circle.\n\nNow, perhaps the triangles AXD and BCX being acute can be used to bound the position of X.\n\nBut maybe proceeding with the equations is better.\n\nLet me try to consider equations 2 and 3 again.\n\nLet me denote for equation 2:\n\nLet me consider the term (h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2). Since h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x,\n\nthen h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 = h x + (24 -k)^2 -k\u00b2 = h x + 576 -48k,\n\nSo equation 2's left side sqrt(h x) * sqrt( h x +576 -48k ) =26 h,\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt( h x (h x +576 -48k) ) =26 h,\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nh x (h x +576 -48k) = 676 h\u00b2,\n\nDivide by h (assuming h \u22600):\n\nx (h x +576 -48k) = 676 h,\n\nSimilarly, equation 3:\n\nLet me write equation 3 similarly.\n\nFirst, note that in equation 3, the term (t\u00b2 +k\u00b2) is equal to t\u00b2 + h t,\n\nsince k\u00b2 = h t,\n\nand the term (t\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2) = t\u00b2 +576 -48k +k\u00b2 = t\u00b2 + h t +576 -48k,\n\nSo equation 3 becomes sqrt( t\u00b2 + h t ) * sqrt( t\u00b2 + h t +576 -48k ) =30 t,\n\nLet me denote sqrt(t (t + h )) = sqrt(t x),\n\nsince h + t =x,\n\nso sqrt(t x) * sqrt(t x +576 -48k ) =30 t,\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nt x (t x +576 -48k ) =900 t\u00b2,\n\nDivide by t,\n\nx (t x +576 -48k ) =900 t,\n\nSo now, equations 2 and 3 now are:\n\nEquation 2b: x (h x +576 -48k) =676 h,\n\nEquation 3b: x (t x +576 -48k ) =900 t,\n\nAnd note that t =x -h,\n\nAlso, from equation 1a: h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nand k\u00b2 = h t,\n\nso h x = h\u00b2 + h t,\n\nwhich simplifies to x = h + t,\n\nwhich is consistent.\n\nLet me now denote variable m =576 -48k,\n\nthen equations become:\n\nEquation 2b: x (h x + m) =676 h,\n\nEquation 3b: x (t x +m ) =900 t,\n\nAlso, since t =x -h,\n\nLet me substitute t =x -h into equation 3b:\n\nx [ (x -h)x + m ] =900(x -h),\n\nExpand:\n\nx [x\u00b2 -h x + m ] =900x -900h,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b3 -h x\u00b2 + m x =900x -900h,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx\u00b3 -h x\u00b2 + m x -900x +900h =0,\n\nFactor terms with h:\n\nx\u00b3 -h x\u00b2 + m x -900x +900h = x\u00b3 + (m -900)x + h(-x\u00b2 +900),\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can subtract equation 2b and equation 3b to eliminate m?\n\nWait, let me see.\n\nEquation 2b: x (h x + m) =676 h,\n\nEquation 3b: x (t x +m ) =900 t,\n\nLet me subtract equation2b from equation3b:\n\nx [ t x +m -h x -m ] =900 t -676 h,\n\nSimplify:\n\nx [ (t -h)x ] =900 t -676 h,\n\nNote that t - h = (x -h) -h =x -2h,\n\nTherefore,\n\nx (x -2h)x =900 t -676 h,\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the left side is x*( (t - h)x ) =x^2 (t -h),\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 (t - h) =900 t -676 h,\n\nBut t =x -h,\n\nSo substitute t =x -h,\n\nLeft side: x\u00b2 ( (x -h) - h ) =x\u00b2 (x -2h),\n\nRight side:900(x -h) -676 h =900x -900h -676h =900x - (900+676)h =900x -1576 h,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 (x -2h) =900x -1576 h,\n\nHmm, this equation involves x and h. Let me see if I can express h in terms of x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express h in terms of x from equation1a.\n\nFrom equation1a: h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nand since k\u00b2 =h t = h(x -h),\n\nthen,\n\nh x = h\u00b2 + h(x -h ) =h\u00b2 +h x -h\u00b2 =h x,\n\nwhich is an identity. So no new information.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find expressions for m.\n\nRecall m =576 -48k,\n\nand k = sqrt(h t) = sqrt( h(x -h) ),\n\nTherefore,\n\nm =576 -48 sqrt( h(x -h) ),\n\nThus, m is expressed in terms of h and x.\n\nBut plugging this into equation2b,\n\nwhich is:\n\nx (h x +m ) =676 h,\n\nSubstituting m,\n\nx (h x +576 -48 sqrt( h(x -h) ) ) =676 h,\n\nThis is an equation in variables h and x.\n\nSimilarly, equation3b can be written in terms of h and x,\n\nbut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that h and t are such that sqrt(h t) is an integer or a nice fraction.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem involves circumradii 13 and 15, which are 13 and 15, perhaps the sides of the triangles are multiples of these.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of triangle AXD which has a circumradius of 13.\n\nThe formula for the circumradius is R=abc/(4A).\n\nFor triangle AXD, sides are AX, XD, AD=24.\n\nLet me denote AX =a, XD =b, AD=24.\n\nArea A = 12h as before.\n\nSo,\n\nR1 = (a * b *24)/(4*12 h) = (a b *24)/(48 h) = (a b)/(2h) =13,\n\nso a b =26 h.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BCX with R2=15,\n\nSides are BC=24, BX=d, CX=e,\n\nArea is 12(x-h),\n\nso,\n\nR2 = (d * e *24)/(4*12(x-h)) = (d e *24)/(48(x-h)) = (d e)/(2(x-h)) =15,\n\nso d e =30(x-h).\n\nAlso, from equation1a, AX^2 + XB^2 = AB^2 ?\n\nWait, no, AX and XB are not necessarily perpendicular except at X.\n\nWait, but angle AXB=90\u00b0, so AX and XB are perpendicular.\n\nSo triangle AXB is right-angled at X, so AX^2 + XB^2 = AB^2.\n\nWait a second! Wait, triangle AXB is right-angled at X, so by Pythagoras,\n\nAX\u00b2 + XB\u00b2 = AB\u00b2,\n\nSo, AX^2 + XB^2 = AB^2 =x\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nAX^2 + XB^2 =x\u00b2,\n\nBut AX and XB are sides of triangles AXD and BCX.\n\nWait, but AX is part of triangle AXD,\n\nand XB is part of triangle BCX.\n\nThis is an important relation that I might have missed earlier.\n\nLet me note that:\n\nAX\u00b2 + XB\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 =x\u00b2.\n\nThis is crucial. Let me write that down.\n\nEquation AXB is right-angled at X, so:\n\nAX\u00b2 + XB\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 = x\u00b2. (Equation 5).\n\nSo now, AX is one side of triangle AXD,\n\nand XB is one side of triangle BCX.\n\nSo perhaps combining this with the previous equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFor triangle AXD,\n\nAX = sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2),\n\nXD = sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2),\n\nAD =24,\n\nand AX * XD =26 h,\n\nas per equation from R1=13.\n\nFor triangle BCX,\n\nBX = sqrt( (x -h)^2 +k\u00b2 ),\n\nCX = sqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ),\n\nBC=24,\n\nand BX * CX =30(x -h),\n\nfrom R2=15.\n\nAlso, AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = x\u00b2,\n\nsince they are the legs of the right triangle AXB.\n\nLet me write AX\u00b2 = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nand BX\u00b2 = (x -h)^2 +k\u00b2,\n\ntherefore,\n\nAX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + (x -h)^2 +k\u00b2 = h\u00b2 + 2k\u00b2 + (x -h)^2 =x\u00b2,\n\nSo,\n\nh\u00b2 + 2k\u00b2 + (x -h)^2 =x\u00b2,\n\nExpand (x -h)^2:\n\n= x\u00b2 -2x h +h\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nh\u00b2 +2k\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -2x h +h\u00b2 =x\u00b2,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2h\u00b2 +2k\u00b2 -2x h +x\u00b2 =x\u00b2,\n\nSubtract x\u00b2:\n\n2h\u00b2 +2k\u00b2 -2x h =0,\n\nDivide by 2:\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 -x h =0,\n\nBut this is exactly equation1a,\n\nso this doesn't give us new information. Okay.\n\nBut maybe combining equations involving AX and BX.\n\nLet me see.\n\nLet me denote AX = a,\n\nXB = b,\n\nso that a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =x\u00b2.\n\nAlso,\n\nfrom triangle AXD: a * sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 -k\u00b2 ) ? Wait not sure.\n\nWait, in triangle AXD, the sides are AX=a, XD, and AD=24.\n\nWait, XD is the distance from X to D, which is sqrt( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ).\n\nBut AX is sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) =a,\n\nso XD^2 = h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 -48k +576 = a\u00b2 -48k +576.\n\nThus, XD = sqrt(a\u00b2 -48k +576).\n\nTherefore, in triangle AXD,\n\nthe product AX * XD =a * sqrt(a\u00b2 -48k +576) =26 h.\n\nBut a\u00b2 =h\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nso,\n\na * sqrt( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 -48k +576 )=26 h,\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BCX,\n\nBX =b= sqrt( (x -h)^2 +k\u00b2 ),\n\nand CX is sqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) = sqrt( (x -h)^2 +k\u00b2 -48k +576 ) = sqrt( b\u00b2 -48k +576 ).\n\nThus, BX * CX =b * sqrt(b\u00b2 -48k +576 ) =30(x -h).\n\nAlso, since a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =x\u00b2,\n\nand we have expressions involving sqrt(a\u00b2 -48k +576) and sqrt(b\u00b2 -48k +576).\n\nThis might be a way forward.\n\nLet me denote M = -48k +576,\n\nthen,\n\nAX * XD =a * sqrt(a\u00b2 + M ) =26 h,\n\nBX * CX =b * sqrt(b\u00b2 + M ) =30(x -h),\n\nAlso, M = -48k +576,\n\nand we also know from AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 =x\u00b2,\n\nand equation1a h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =a\u00b2 =x h.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFrom equation1a,\n\na\u00b2 =h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =x h,\n\nso,\n\na\u00b2 =x h,\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2 = (x -h)^2 +k\u00b2 =x\u00b2 -2x h +h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =x\u00b2 -2x h +x h (from a\u00b2 =x h) => x\u00b2 -x h,\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2 =x\u00b2 -x h,\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =x h +x\u00b2 -x h =x\u00b2,\n\nwhich checks out.\n\nSo, we can express a\u00b2 =x h,\n\nand b\u00b2 =x(x -h),\n\nSo, in terms of a and b,\n\nAX =a =sqrt(x h),\n\nBX =b =sqrt(x(x -h)),\n\nand M = -48k +576,\n\nbut k can be expressed in terms of a and h,\n\nsince a\u00b2 =h\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nso k\u00b2 =a\u00b2 -h\u00b2 =x h -h\u00b2 =h(x -h) =h t,\n\nwhere t =x -h,\n\nwhich is consistent with earlier.\n\nAlso, k = sqrt(h t).\n\nThus,\n\nM =-48 sqrt(h t ) +576,\n\nTherefore,\n\nthe equations become:\n\nFor AXD:\n\na * sqrt(a\u00b2 + M ) =26 h,\n\nSubstitute a\u00b2 =x h,\n\nand M = -48 sqrt(h t ) +576,\n\nTherefore,\n\nsqrt(x h) * sqrt( x h + (-48 sqrt(h t ) +576 )) =26 h,\n\nSimplify inside the sqrt:\n\nx h +576 -48 sqrt( h t ) =x h +576 -48 sqrt(h(x -h )),\n\nBut since t =x -h,\n\nthis is x h +576 -48 sqrt( h(x -h )),\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(x h) * sqrt( x h +576 -48 sqrt( h(x -h )) )=26 h,\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx h [x h +576 -48 sqrt( h(x -h )) ] =676 h\u00b2,\n\nDivide by h:\n\nx [x h +576 -48 sqrt( h(x -h )) ] =676 h,\n\nSimilarly, for BCX:\n\nBX * sqrt(BX\u00b2 + M ) =30 t,\n\nWait, no, equation for BCX:\n\nBX * CX =30 t,\n\nwhere CX = sqrt(b\u00b2 +M ) = sqrt( b\u00b2 + M ),\n\nsince M = -48k +576,\n\nso,\n\nb * sqrt( b\u00b2 + M ) =30 t,\n\nAgain, substitute b\u00b2 =x(x -h),\n\nand M =-48 sqrt(h t ) +576,\n\nthen,\n\nsqrt(x(x -h )) * sqrt( x(x -h ) + (-48 sqrt(h t ) +576 )) =30 t,\n\nInside the sqrt:\n\nx(x -h ) +576 -48 sqrt( h t ) =x(x -h ) +576 -48 sqrt( h t ),\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(x(x -h )) * sqrt( x(x -h ) +576 -48 sqrt( h t ) )=30 t,\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx(x -h ) [x(x -h ) +576 -48 sqrt( h t ) ] =900 t\u00b2,\n\nThese equations are still complex, but perhaps we can set variables like letting y = sqrt( h(x -h )) = sqrt( h t ) =k,\n\nsince k = sqrt( h t ).\n\nLet me set y =k =sqrt( h t ),\n\nthen,\n\ny\u00b2 =h(x -h )=h t,\n\nand also,\n\nsqrt(x h ) =sqrt( a\u00b2 ) =a,\n\nand sqrt(x(x -h )) =b,\n\nThus,\n\nEquation AXD squared:\n\nx h [x h +576 -48 y ] =676 h\u00b2,\n\nDivide by h,\n\nx [x h +576 -48 y ] =676 h,\n\nEquation BCX squared:\n\nx(x -h ) [x(x -h ) +576 -48 y ] =900 t\u00b2 =900 (x -h )\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by (x -h )^2,\n\n[x(x -h ) / (x -h )^2 ) ] * [x(x -h ) +576 -48 y ] =900,\n\nSimplify:\n\n[ x / (x -h ) ] * [x(x -h ) +576 -48 y ] =900,\n\nLet me denote z =x/(x -h ),\n\nthen,\n\nz * [x(x -h ) +576 -48 y ] =900,\n\nBut x(x -h ) =b\u00b2,\n\nand z =x/(x -h ) =x/t,\n\nsince t =x -h,\n\nso,\n\n(x/t) * [b\u00b2 +576 -48 y ] =900,\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe denote variables in terms of y.\n\nLet me see:\n\nWe have y =k =sqrt( h(x -h )),\n\nso y\u00b2 =h(x -h),\n\nand also,\n\nfrom equation AXD's equation after substitution:\n\nx [x h +576 -48 y ] =676 h,\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx\u00b2 h +576 x -48 x y =676 h,\n\nRearranged:\n\nx\u00b2 h -676 h +576 x -48 x y =0,\n\nFactor h:\n\nh(x\u00b2 -676 ) +576x -48x y =0,\n\nSimilarly, from the BCX equation after substitution:\n\nx(x -h ) [x(x -h ) +576 -48 y ] =900 (x -h )\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by (x -h ):\n\nx [x(x -h ) +576 -48 y ] =900(x -h ),\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx\u00b2(x -h ) +576x -48x y =900(x -h ),\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx\u00b2(x -h ) +576x -48x y -900(x -h )=0,\n\nFactor (x -h ):\n\n(x -h )(x\u00b2 -900 ) +576x -48x y =0,\n\nHmm,\n\nThese equations are still complex but maybe we can find a relationship between them.\n\nLet me note that both equations have terms 576x -48x y.\n\nLet me denote C =576x -48x y,\n\nthen,\n\nFrom AXD equation:\n\nh(x\u00b2 -676 ) + C =0,\n\nFrom BCX equation:\n\n(x -h)(x\u00b2 -900 ) +C =0,\n\nTherefore,\n\nh(x\u00b2 -676 ) + C =0,\n\n(x -h)(x\u00b2 -900 ) +C =0,\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second,\n\n(x -h)(x\u00b2 -900 ) - h(x\u00b2 -676 ) =0,\n\nExpand the first term:\n\nx(x\u00b2 -900 ) -h(x\u00b2 -900 ) -h(x\u00b2 -676 )=0,\n\nExpand all terms:\n\nx\u00b3 -900x -h x\u00b2 +900h -h x\u00b2 +676h =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b3 -900x -2h x\u00b2 + (900h +676h ) =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b3 -2h x\u00b2 -900x +1576h =0,\n\nHmm, this equation relates x and h,\n\nBut also, from equation AXD's equation,\n\nC = -h(x\u00b2 -676 ),\n\nand C =576x -48x y,\n\nso,\n\n576x -48x y = -h(x\u00b2 -676 ),\n\n=> 576x -48x y +h(x\u00b2 -676 )=0,\n\nWhich is exactly the same as the first equation we had earlier.\n\nSo, no new info.\n\nPerhaps assume specific values for x?\n\nGiven that the problem is likely set up with integer lengths, perhaps x is an integer.\n\nLet me see if I can find integer x such that the equations can be satisfied.\n\nLet me consider that the product AX * XD =26 h,\n\nand AX =sqrt(x h),\n\nso,\n\nsqrt(x h)*XD =26h,\n\n=> XD =26h / sqrt(x h)=26 sqrt( h /x ),\n\nSimilarly, from equation AXD:\n\nXD = sqrt( h\u00b2 + (24 -k )\u00b2 ) = sqrt( h\u00b2 + (24 -sqrt(h(x -h )) )\u00b2 ).\n\nHmm, but this is complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume x is 25 or 26 or something.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, AD=24,\n\nwith circumradius 13,\n\nso using the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*A),\n\nso,\n\n13 = (AX * XD *24)/(4*12h),\n\n=> 13 = (AX * XD *24)/(48h),\n\n=> AX * XD = (13 *48h)/24 =26h,\n\nwhich matches our earlier result.\n\nSimilarly for the other triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that in an acute triangle, all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so the circumradius conditions are compatible with that.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that x = 30 or some number.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the problem is designed such that AB is 25 or 48 or something.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in equation AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 =x\u00b2,\n\nwith AX and BX related to the circumradii.\n\nAlternatively, think of the system of equations in terms of h and t.\n\nLet me let h = a, t =b,\n\nso that x =a +b,\n\nk = sqrt(ab),\n\nand equations become:\n\nEquation AXD squared:\n\na(a +b)[a(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab)] =676 a\u00b2,\n\nEquation BCX squared:\n\nb(a +b)[b(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab)] =900 b\u00b2,\n\nLet me divide the first equation by a\u00b2,\n\nand the second by b\u00b2,\n\nto get:\n\n[(a +b)/a][ (a +b) +576/a -48 sqrt(ab)/a ] =676/a,\n\nWait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let me set s = sqrt(ab) =k,\n\nthen,\n\nab =s\u00b2,\n\nand x =a +b,\n\nEquation AXD squared:\n\na x [a x +576 -48 s ] =676 a\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by a,\n\nx [a x +576 -48 s ]=676 a,\n\nSimilarly, equation BCX squared:\n\nb x [b x +576 -48 s ] =900 b\u00b2,\n\nDivide by b,\n\nx [b x +576 -48 s ]=900 b,\n\nNow, these are two equations:\n\n1. x(a x +576 -48 s ) =676 a,\n\n2. x(b x +576 -48 s ) =900 b,\n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\nx a x +x(576 -48 s ) -676 a =0,\n\n=> x\u00b2 a +576x -48x s -676 a =0,\n\nSimilarly, equation2:\n\nx b x +x(576 -48 s ) -900 b =0,\n\n=>x\u00b2 b +576x -48x s -900 b =0,\n\nNow, notice that both equations have the terms 576x -48x s,\n\nLet me denote this as D =576x -48x s,\n\nThen,\n\nequation1 becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 a + D -676a =0,\n\nequation2 becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 b + D -900b =0,\n\nSubtract equation1 from equation2,\n\n(x\u00b2 b + D -900b ) - (x\u00b2 a + D -676a ) =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 (b -a ) -900b +676a =0,\n\nFactor:\n\nx\u00b2 (b -a ) + ( -900b +676a )=0,\n\nNote that b =x -a,\n\nsince b =t =x -h,\n\nand h =a,\n\nso,\n\nb =x -a,\n\nSubstitute into equation:\n\nx\u00b2 ( (x -a ) -a ) + ( -900(x -a ) +676a )=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 (x -2a ) + ( -900x +900a +676a )=0,\n\n= x\u00b3 -2a x\u00b2 + (-900x +1576a )=0,\n\nRearranged:\n\nx\u00b3 -2a x\u00b2 -900x +1576a =0,\n\nFactor terms with a:\n\nx\u00b3 -900x +a(-2x\u00b2 +1576 )=0,\n\nThus,\n\na( -2x\u00b2 +1576 ) = -x\u00b3 +900x,\n\nThus,\n\na = (x\u00b3 -900x )/(2x\u00b2 -1576 ),\n\nSimilarly, since b =x -a,\n\nthen,\n\nb =x - (x\u00b3 -900x )/(2x\u00b2 -1576 ),\n\nThis expression for a in terms of x allows us to express a as a function of x.\n\nNow, recall that s =sqrt(ab),\n\nand also from equation1,\n\nwe can express D =676a -x\u00b2a,\n\nWait,\n\nFrom equation1:\n\nx\u00b2 a + D =676a,\n\n=> D =676a -x\u00b2 a =a(676 -x\u00b2),\n\nBut also,\n\nD =576x -48x s,\n\nThus,\n\na(676 -x\u00b2 ) =576x -48x s,\n\n=> a(676 -x\u00b2 ) +48x s =576x,\n\nSimilarly, since s =sqrt(ab),\n\nand a and b are expressed in terms of x,\n\nthis can be substituted.\n\nThis is getting very algebra-heavy, but perhaps plugging the expression for a into this equation.\n\nLet me proceed.\n\nWe have:\n\na = (x\u00b3 -900x)/(2x\u00b2 -1576),\n\nand b =x -a = [2x\u00b3 -1576x -x\u00b3 +900x]/(2x\u00b2 -1576 ) = (x\u00b3 -676x )/(2x\u00b2 -1576 ),\n\nThus,\n\nab = a*b = [ (x\u00b3 -900x )/(2x\u00b2 -1576 ) ] * [ (x\u00b3 -676x )/(2x\u00b2 -1576 ) ],\n\nBut s =sqrt(ab),\n\nso,\n\ns = sqrt( [ (x\u00b3 -900x)(x\u00b3 -676x) ] / (2x\u00b2 -1576 )\u00b2 ),\n\nThis is very complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nNow, returning to the equation:\n\na(676 -x\u00b2 ) +48x s =576x,\n\nSubstitute a,\n\nand s,\n\nLet me write this step by step.\n\nFirst, compute a(676 -x\u00b2):\n\na(676 -x\u00b2 ) = [ (x\u00b3 -900x )/(2x\u00b2 -1576 ) ]*(676 -x\u00b2 ),\n\nThen,\n\n48x s =48x * sqrt( [ (x\u00b3 -900x)(x\u00b3 -676x) ] / (2x\u00b2 -1576 )\u00b2 )\n\n=48x * [ sqrt( (x\u00b3 -900x)(x\u00b3 -676x) ) / (2x\u00b2 -1576 ) ]\n\nThus,\n\nEquation becomes:\n\n[ (x\u00b3 -900x )(676 -x\u00b2 ) / (2x\u00b2 -1576 ) ] + [48x sqrt( (x\u00b3 -900x)(x\u00b3 -676x) ) / (2x\u00b2 -1576 ) ] =576x,\n\nMultiply both sides by (2x\u00b2 -1576 ):\n\n(x\u00b3 -900x )(676 -x\u00b2 ) +48x sqrt( (x\u00b3 -900x)(x\u00b3 -676x) ) =576x(2x\u00b2 -1576 ),\n\nThis equation is extremely complex, but perhaps for integer x, terms inside sqrt become perfect squares.\n\nPerhaps assume that x is an integer such that (x\u00b3 -900x)(x\u00b3 -676x) is a perfect square.\n\nLet me try values of x that are divisors of 900 or 676? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that 676 is 26\u00b2, and 900 is 30\u00b2,\n\nso perhaps x is 26 or 30?\n\nLet me test x=26,\n\nThen,\n\nCompute a = (26\u00b3 -900*26)/(2*(26)^2 -1576 )\n\nCalculate numerator:26\u00b3 =17,576; 900*26=23,400; 17,576-23,400 =-5,824,\n\nDenominator:2*(676) -1576=1352-1576= -224,\n\nThus,\n\na = (-5,824)/(-224)=5,824/224=26,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = (26\u00b3 -676*26)/(2*(26)^2 -1576 )\n\nNumerator:17,576 -676*26=17,576-17,576=0,\n\nThus b=0,\n\nBut then b =x -a =26 -26=0,\n\nWhich would mean t =0, so point X would be at h =a =26, t=0, so coordinate (26, k ).\n\nBut since t=0, then k =sqrt(h t )=0,\n\nThus, point X would be (26,0), which is point B,\n\nBut the problem states that X is inside the rectangle, so this is invalid.\n\nThus x=26 is not valid.\n\nTry x=30,\n\nCompute a=(30\u00b3 -900*30)/(2*30\u00b2 -1576 )\n\nNumerator:27000 -27000=0,\n\nThus a=0,\n\nBut then h=0, which would put X at (0,k), but then inside the rectangle, possible,\n\nbut then b =x -a =30,\n\nand s =sqrt(ab)=0,\n\nthen,\n\nequation gives,\n\n0*(...) +48x *0 =576x,\n\n0=576x,\n\nimplies x=0,\n\nContradiction,\n\nThus x=30 is invalid.\n\nTry x= 25,\n\na=(25\u00b3 -900*25)/(2*25\u00b2 -1576 )\n\nNumerator:15625 -22500= -6875,\n\nDenominator:2*625 -1576=1250-1576= -326,\n\nThus,\n\na = -6875 / -326 \u224821.08,\n\nNot integer, but let's see,\n\nThen b=25 -21.08\u22483.92,\n\ns=sqrt(ab)=sqrt(21.08*3.92)\u2248sqrt(82.6)\u22489.09,\n\nThen equation:\n\na(676 -x\u00b2 ) +48x s = ?\n\nCalculate:\n\na*(676 -625)=21.08*(51)=1075,\n\n48*25*9.09\u224848*25*9=10,800,\n\nTotal LHS\u22481075+10,800\u224811,875,\n\nRHS=576*25=14,400,\n\nNot equal.\n\nNot valid.\n\nTry x= 24,\n\na=(24\u00b3 -900*24)/(2*24\u00b2 -1576 )\n\n24\u00b3=13,824; 900*24=21,600,\n\nnumerator=13,824-21,600= -7,776,\n\ndenominator=2*576 -1576=1152-1576= -424,\n\na= -7,776 / -424\u224818.34,\n\nb=24 -18.34\u22485.66,\n\ns= sqrt(18.34*5.66)\u2248sqrt(103.8)\u224810.19,\n\nThen,\n\na(676 -x\u00b2)=18.34*(676-576)=18.34*100\u22481834,\n\n48x s\u224848*24*10.19\u224848*245.36\u224811,777,\n\nTotal LHS\u22481834+11,777\u224813,611,\n\nRHS=576*24=13,824,\n\nClose but not equal.\n\nHmm.\n\nTry x= 20,\n\na=(8000 -18000)/(800-1576 )= (-10,000)/(-776)=\u224812.88,\n\nb=20 -12.88\u22487.12,\n\ns= sqrt(12.88*7.12)=sqrt(91.6)\u22489.57,\n\nLHS:\n\na(676 -400)=12.88*276\u22483,563,\n\n48x s=48*20*9.57\u224848*191.4\u22489,187,\n\nTotal\u224812,750,\n\nRHS=576*20=11,520,\n\nNot equal.\n\nHmm.\n\nTry x= 13,\n\na=(2197 -11,700)/(338-1576)= (-9503)/(-1238)=\u22487.68,\n\nb\u224813-7.68=5.32,\n\ns=sqrt(7.68*5.32)\u2248sqrt(40.8)\u22486.39,\n\nLHS:\n\na*(676 -169)=7.68*507\u22483,893,\n\n48x s=48*13*6.39\u224848*83.07\u22483,987,\n\nTotal\u22483,893+3,987\u22487,880,\n\nRHS=576*13\u22487,488,\n\nNot equal.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x= sqrt(676)=26, but that was already tried.\n\nAlternatively, x= 39,\n\nLet me try x=39,\n\na=(39\u00b3 -900*39)/(2*(39)^2 -1576 )\n\n39\u00b3=59319; 900*39=35,100,\n\nNumerator=59319-35100=24,219,\n\nDenominator=2*1521 -1576=3042-1576=1466,\n\na\u224824,219/1466\u224816.53,\n\nb=39-16.53\u224822.47,\n\ns= sqrt(16.53*22.47)=sqrt(371.1)\u224819.26,\n\nThen LHS:\n\na*(676 -x\u00b2)=16.53*(676-1521)=16.53*(-845)\u2248-13, 955,\n\n48x s=48*39*19.26\u224848*751\u224836,048,\n\nTotal LHS\u2248-13,955 +36,048\u224822,093,\n\nRHS=576*39=22,464,\n\nClose but not exact.

perhaps this approach is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look for x such that 2x\u00b2 -1576 divides x\u00b3 -900x,\n\nand also 2x\u00b2 -1576 divides x\u00b3 -676x,\n\nfor a and b to be

that the problem requires using coordinate geometry with the two circles.\n\nSince X is on the circle with diameter AB (equation (h -x/2)^2 +k^2=(x/2)^2),\n\nand also lies such that triangles AXD and

sqrt( (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 )*sqrt( (x -a)^2 + (24 -b)^2 )=30(x -a),\n\nand equation from AXB right angle: equation1 is already there.\n\nThis is four equations but with three variables a,b,x.\n\nWait, equation1 is from the circle, equation2 from AXD circumradius, equation3 from BCX circumradius, and equation AXB is the same as equation1.\n\nThus, we can use equations1,2,3.\n\nLet me attempt to set up equations 2 and 3 with equation1.\n\nFrom equation1: a\u00b2 =x a -b\u00b2,\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =x a,\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2)=sqrt(x a),\n\nwhich is AX.\n\nSimilarly, for equation2:\n\nsqrt(x a)*sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 ) =26a,\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx a [a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 ]=676a\u00b2,\n\nCancel a (assuming a\u22600):\n\nx [a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 ] =676a,\n\nSimilarly, equation3:\n\nsqrt( (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 )*sqrt( (x -a)^2 + (24 -b)^2 )=30(x -a),\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[ (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 ][ (x -a)^2 + (24 -b)^2 ]=900(x -a)^2,\n\nThis is similar to previous approaches.\n\nLet me see if I can express (24 -b)^2 in terms of a and x.\n\nFrom equation1, b\u00b2 =x a -a\u00b2,\n\nso,\n\n(24 -b)^2 =576 -48b +b\u00b2 =576 -48b +x a -a\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nequation2's equation becomes:\n\nx [a\u00b2 +576 -48b +x a -a\u00b2 ]=676a,\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\na\u00b2 cancels,\n\nso,\n\nx [576 -48b +x a ] =676a,\n\nTherefore,\n\nx*(576 -48b +x a ) =676a,\n\nSimilarly, equation from AXB right angle: a\u00b2 =x a -b\u00b2,\n\nso,\n\nb\u00b2 =x a -a\u00b2,\n\nand b =sqrt(x a -a\u00b2 ),\n\nbut that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote variable m =b,\n\nthen,\n\nb =m,\n\nand b\u00b2 =x a -a\u00b2,\n\nso,\n\nequation2 becomes:\n\nx*(576 -48m +x a ) =676a,\n\nBut m =b =sqrt( x a -a\u00b2 ),\n\nwhich complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume specific values for a and x.\n\nSuppose that a =13,\n\nthen from equation1,\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =x a,\n\nso,\n\n169 +b\u00b2 =13x,\n\nThus,\n\nx = (169 +b\u00b2)/13,\n\nAlso, equation2:\n\nsqrt(13\u00b2 +b\u00b2)*sqrt(13\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 )=26*13=338,\n\nCompute sqrt(169 +b\u00b2)*sqrt(169 + (24 -b)^2 )=338,\n\nLet me compute the left side squared:\n\n(169 +b\u00b2)(169 + (24 -b)^2 )=338\u00b2=114,244,\n\nExpand the second term:\n\n(24 -b)^2 =576 -48b +b\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n(169 +b\u00b2)(169 +576 -48b +b\u00b2)= (169 +b\u00b2)(745 -48b +b\u00b2)=114,244,\n\nLet me denote c =b\u00b2,\n\nthen,\n\n(169 +c)(745 -48b +c )=114,244,\n\nThis is complex,\n\nBut since b is a variable here,\n\nPerhaps trial,\n\nSuppose b= 12,\n\nthen,\n\n169 +144=313,\n\n(24-12)^2=144,\n\nso second term:169+144=313,\n\nThus,\n\n313*313=97,969 <114,244,\n\nToo small.\n\nTry

close.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, this trial and error might not be the best approach.\n\nPerhaps consider that in triangle AXD, with R=13,\n\nand AD=24,\n\nthe side AD is the longest side if triangle is acute,\n\nso AD < AX and XD,\n\nor not necessarily.\n\nWait, in an acute triangle, the square of each side is less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nThus for triangle AXD,\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2,\n\nAX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > XD\u00b2,\n\nXD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > AX\u00b2,\n\nGiven AD=24,\n\nso,\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 >576,\n\nAX\u00b2 +576 > XD\u00b2,\n\nXD\u00b2 +576>AX\u00b2,\n\nSimilarly for triangle BCX.\n\nBut perhaps this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that AX and XD are such that their product is 26h,\n\nand AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 = (AX + XD)^2 -2AX XD,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of AX and XD as variables satisfying AX * XD =26h,\n\nand AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 >576,\n\nand then find possible values.\n\nLet me denote AX =m, XD =n,\n\nthen m n =26h,\n\nand m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 >576,\n\nAlso,\n\nm\u00b2 =a\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nn\u00b2 =a\u00b2 +(24 -k)^2,\n\nAdding these,\n\nm\u00b2 +n\u00b2 =2a\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 +k\u00b2,\n\nWait,\n\nWait,\n\nWait, m\u00b2 =a\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nn\u00b2 =a\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2,\n\nThus,\n\nm\u00b2 +n\u00b2 =2a\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2,\n\n=2a\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k +k\u00b2,\n\n=2a\u00b2 +2k\u00b2 -48k +576,\n\nBut from equation1,\n\na\u00b2 =x a -k\u00b2,\n\nso,\n\n2a\u00b2 =2x a -2k\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nm\u00b2 +n\u00b2 =2x a -2k\u00b2 +2k\u00b2 -48k +576,\n\n=2x a -48k +576,\n\nThus,\n\nm\u00b2 +n\u00b2 =2x a -48k +576,\n\nBut m n =26h=26a,\n\nso,\n\nm\u00b2 +n\u00b2 = (m +n)^2 -2 m n = (m+n)^2 -52a,\n\nThus,\n\n(m +n)^2 -52a =2x a -48k +576,\n\nHmm,\n\nBut this may not help.\n\nAlternatively, this problem is extremely complex and might need a system of equations solver.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a trick.\n\nSince angle AXB is 90\u00b0, and triangles AXD and BCX have circumradii 13 and 15.\n\nRecall that in a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse.\n\nHowever, AXD and BCX are acute, so not right-angled.\n\nBut perhaps the given circumradii relate to other properties.\n\nAlternatively, consider coordinates.\n\nLet me assume AB =x,\n\ncoordinates as before,\n\nX is (h,k),\n\nangle AXB is 90\u00b0,\n\nso h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + (x\u2212h)^2 +k\u00b2 =x\u00b2,\n\nWait no, angle AXB is 90\u00b0,\n\nthe vectors AX and BX are perpendicular,\n\nso AX \u2022 BX =0,\n\nwhich gives,\n\nh(x\u2212h) +k\u00b2 =0,\n\n=> h x -h\u00b2 +k\u00b2=0,\n\nwhich is equation1,\n\nh x =h\u00b2 -k\u00b2,\n\nWait, no,\n\nWait, the dot product is AX \u2022 BX =0,\n\nAX is vector from A to X: (h,k),\n\nBX is vector from B to X: (h -x, k -0) = (h -x, k),\n\nWait, no,\n\nWait, coordinates:\n\nPoint A is (0,0),\n\nPoint B is (x,0),\n\nPoint X is (h,k).\n\nThus,\n\nVector AX is (h,k),\n\nVector BX is (h -x, k),\n\nTheir dot product:\n\nh*(h -x) +k *k =0,\n\nSo,\n\nh\u00b2 -h x +k\u00b2=0,\n\nWhich is equation1,\n\nso h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =h x,\n\nThus,\n\nh x =h\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nYes.\n\nThus, in the right triangle AXB,\n\nAX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 =AB\u00b2,\n\nAX\u00b2 =h\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nBX\u00b2=(x\u2212h)^2 +k\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nAX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 =h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -2xh +h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =2h\u00b2 +2k\u00b2 -2xh +x\u00b2,\n\nBut from equation1,\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =h x,\n\nSo substituting,\n\n2(h x) -2xh +x\u00b2 =x\u00b2=AB\u00b2,\n\nwhich checks out.\n\nNow, perhaps consider triangle AXD and BCX.\n\nLet me consider triangle AXD:\n\nPoints A(0,0), X(h,k), D(0,24).\n\nThe circumradius R1=13,\n\nso using formula R= (a*b*c)/(4*A),\n\nwhere a,b,c are sides,\n\na=AX= sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2),\n\nb=XD= sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24\u2212k)^2),\n\nc=AD=24,\n\nArea A= (base * height)/2= (24 *h)/2=12h,\n\nThus,\n\n13= (a*b*24)/(4*12h)= (a*b)/(2h),\n\nso,\n\na*b=26h,\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)*sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24\u2212k)^2)=26h,\n\nSimilarly for triangle BCX,\n\nPoints B(x,0), C(x,24), X(h,k),\n\nSides:\n\nBX= sqrt( (x\u2212h)^2 +k\u00b2 ),\n\nCX= sqrt( (x\u2212h)^2 + (24\u2212k)^2 ),\n\nBC=24,\n\nArea=(24*(x\u2212h))/2=12(x\u2212h),\n\nThus,\n\nR2= (BX*CX*24)/(4*12(x\u2212h))= (BX*CX)/(2(x\u2212h))=15,\n\nThus,\n\nBX*CX=30(x\u2212h),\n\nTherefore,\n\nsqrt( (x\u2212h)^2 +k\u00b2 )*sqrt( (x\u2212h)^2 + (24\u2212k)^2 )=30(x\u2212h),\n\nNow, let me consider the two equations:\n\nEquation2: sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)*sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24\u2212k)^2)=26h,\n\nEquation3: sqrt( (x\u2212h)^2 +k\u00b2 )*sqrt( (x\u2212h)^2 + (24\u2212k)^2 )=30(x\u2212h),\n\nLet me denote for equation2,\n\nLet me set u =h,\n\nand v =24\u2212k,\n\nthen equation2 becomes sqrt(u\u00b2 + (24\u2212v)^2 )*sqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 )=26u,\n\nWait, swapping variables,\n\nAlternatively, set for equation2,\n\nLet me set m =h,\n\nn =24\u2212k,\n\nThen,\n\nk=24\u2212n,\n\nso,\n\nequation2 becomes:\n\nsqrt(m\u00b2 + (24\u2212n)^2 ) * sqrt(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 ) =26m,\n\nSimilarly, for equation3,\n\nLet me set p =x\u2212h,\n\nq =24\u2212k =n,\n\nThus,\n\nequation3 becomes:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (24\u2212q)^2 ) * sqrt(p\u00b2 +q\u00b2 )=30p,\n\nBut note that n =q,\n\nand p =x-h,\n\nand m =h,\n\nThus,\n\nthe equations are structurally the same except variables m and p,\n\nand they share the same n =q.\n\nAdditionally, from equation1,\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =h x,\n\nwith k=24\u2212n,\n\nso,\n\nh\u00b2 + (24\u2212n)^2 =h x,\n\nAlso,\n\np =x -h,\n\nso,\n\nx =h +p,\n\nSo,\n\nh\u00b2 + (24\u2212n)^2 =h (h +p),\n\n=> h\u00b2 +576 -48n +n\u00b2 =h\u00b2 +h p,\n\nThus,\n\n576 -48n +n\u00b2 =h p,\n\nAlso,\n\nwe have variables m =h,\n\np =x\u2212h,\n\nand n =24\u2212k,\n\nbut k is between0 and24,\n\nso n is between0 and24,\n\nThus,\n\nthe equations are:\n\nFor equation2:\n\nsqrt(m\u00b2 + (24\u2212n)^2 ) * sqrt(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 ) =26m,\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nsqrt( m\u00b2 + (24\u2212n)^2 ) * sqrt(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 )=26m,\n\nSimilarly, equation3:\n\nsqrt(p\u00b2 + (24\u2212n)^2 ) * sqrt(p\u00b2 +n\u00b2 )=30p,\n\nAnd,\n\n576 -48n +n\u00b2 =m*p,\n\nThus, we have three equations with three variables m, p, n.\n\nPerhaps now it's easier to consider that equations2 and3 are symmetric in m and p with the same n.\n\nLet me denote equation2 as:\n\nsqrt(m\u00b2 + (24\u2212n)^2 ) * sqrt(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 )=26m,\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n[m\u00b2 + (24\u2212n)^2][m\u00b2 +n\u00b2]=676m\u00b2,\n\nExpand left side:\n\nm^4 +m\u00b2n\u00b2 +m\u00b2(24\u2212n)^2 +n\u00b2(24\u2212n)^2,\n\nWait, alternatively,\n\nFirst term:

+n\u00b2(24\u2212n)^2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nThis expands to:\n\nm^4 +m\u00b2[576 -48n +2n\u00b2] +n\u00b2(576 -48n +n\u00b2),\n\nThus,\n\nm^4 + (576 -48n +2n\u00b2)m\u00b2 + (576n\u00b2 -48n^3 +n^4 ) =676m\u00b2,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nm^4 + (576-48n+2n\u00b2 -676)m\u00b2 + (576n\u00b2 -48n^3 +n^4 )=0,\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\n576-676 = -100,\n\nThus,\n\nm^4 + (-100 -48n

equation in variable (m or p):\n\nvariable^4 + (-100 -48n +2n\u00b2) variable\u00b2 + (n^4 -48n^3 +576n\u00b2 )=0,\n\nSo both m and p are roots of the same equation,\n\nTherefore,\n\nthe product m*p is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient (with sign),\n\nsince for equation variable\u00b2 + b variable +c =0,\n\nproduct is c,\n\nbut here it's quartic,\n\nWait, the equation

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD where BC is 24 units long. There's a point X inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, the triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, and their circumradii are 13 and 15 respectively. I need to find the length of AB. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me draw a diagram in my mind. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Let me label the rectangle with A at the bottom-left corner, B at the bottom-right, C at the top-right, and D at the top-left. So, AB is the base, BC is the vertical side which is given as 24. So, BC = AD = 24, and AB = CD, which is the length we need to find.\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, and angle AXB is 90 degrees. That means if I consider points A and B, then X lies somewhere such that when you connect A to X and B to X, the angle between those two lines is a right angle. That forms a right angle triangle at X, but since X is inside the rectangle, it can't be on the sides. \n\nAlso, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. Hmm, so all their angles are less than 90 degrees. Their circumradii are given as 13 and 15 respectively. Remember that the circumradius of a triangle is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area), where a, b, c are the sides. Alternatively, for a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. But wait, AXB is a right angle, but AXD and BXC are not necessarily right-angled. Wait, the problem says triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, so they can't have a right angle. Therefore, their circumradii must be calculated using the general formula.\n\nLet me denote coordinates to make this easier. Let me place the rectangle on a coordinate system with point A at (0,0). Then, since AB is the base, let me denote AB as length 'a', which is what we need to find. So coordinates:\n\n- A = (0,0)\n- B = (a, 0)\n- C = (a, 24)\n- D = (0, 24)\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, so let's denote its coordinates as (x,y), where 0 < x < a and 0 < y < 24.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90 degrees. The vectors AX and BX should be perpendicular. The vector AX is (x, y) and the vector BX is (x - a, y). Their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (x)(x - a) + y*y = 0.\n\nThat gives the equation: x(x - a) + y\u00b2 = 0. Let me note this as equation (1).\n\nNow, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute and have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively.\n\nLet me first consider triangle AXD. The points are A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). So, the sides of triangle AXD are:\n\n- AX: distance from A to X, which is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n- XD: distance from X to D, which is sqrt((x - 0)^2 + (y - 24)^2) = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y - 24)^2)\n- AD: distance from A to D, which is 24 (since it's the vertical side of the rectangle). Wait, AD is a side of the rectangle, so that's fixed at 24. But in triangle AXD, the three sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, triangle AXD has vertices at A, X, D. So the three sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, AD is indeed a side of the rectangle, so that's 24. So sides are AX, XD, and AD=24. Similarly, triangle BXC has vertices at B, X, C, so sides are BX, XC, and BC=24. Wait, but BC is the vertical side, so BC is 24. Wait, but triangle BXC's sides would be BX, XC, and BC? Hmm, actually, BC is from B to C, which is a side of the rectangle, but in triangle BXC, the third side is BC? Wait, let me confirm.\n\nWait, triangle BXC has vertices at B, X, and C. So sides are BX, XC, and BC. Since BC is 24, that's one side. Similarly, triangle AXD has sides AX, XD, and AD=24.\n\nBut since both triangles are acute, all their angles are less than 90 degrees. The circumradius for each triangle can be calculated using the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area). Since they are not right-angled, we can't use the half hypotenuse formula here.\n\nFirst, let's handle triangle AXD with circumradius 13. Let's denote the sides as follows:\n\nLet me call the sides:\n\nIn triangle AXD:\n\n- Let\u2019s denote AX = m = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n- XD = n = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y - 24)^2)\n- AD = p = 24\n\nThen, the circumradius R\u2081 = 13 = (m*n*p)/(4*Area\u2081)\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\n- BX = sqrt( (x - a)^2 + y^2 )\n- XC = sqrt( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n- BC = 24\n\nCircumradius R\u2082 = 15 = (BX*XC*BC)/(4*Area\u2082)\n\nHmm, so we need expressions for the areas of these triangles as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Since all coordinates are known in terms of x, y, a, perhaps we can express the areas using coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, the area can also be computed via the determinant formula for coordinates.\n\nFor triangle AXD with points A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24):\n\nArea\u2081 = (1/2)* | (0*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - y) ) | = (1/2)* | 0 + 24x + 0 | = 12x\n\nWait, is that right? Let me recall the formula for area using coordinates. The area is (1/2)| x\u2081(y\u2082 - y\u2083) + x\u2082(y\u2083 - y\u2081) + x\u2083(y\u2081 - y\u2082) |.\n\nPlugging in A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24):\n\nArea\u2081 = (1/2)|0*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - y)| = (1/2)|24x| = 12x.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC with points B(a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24):\n\nArea\u2082 = (1/2)|a*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + a*(0 - y)|\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst term: a*(y - 24)\n\nSecond term: x*(24 - 0) = 24x\n\nThird term: a*(0 - y) = -a y\n\nSo altogether:\n\nArea\u2082 = (1/2)| a(y -24) +24x - a y | = (1/2)| a y -24 a +24x - a y | = (1/2)| -24a +24x | = (1/2)*24|x - a| =12|x -a|\n\nSince x is between 0 and a, (x -a) is negative, so absolute value makes it 12(a -x). So Area\u2082 =12(a - x).\n\nSo now, going back to the circumradius formula for triangle AXD:\n\nR\u2081 = (AX * XD * AD) / (4 * Area\u2081) = (m * n * 24) / (4 *12x) ) = (m n *24)/(48x) ) = (m n)/(2x)\n\nBut R\u2081 is given as 13, so:\n\n(m n)/(2x) =13 => m n =26x.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\nR\u2082 = (BX * XC * BC)/(4 * Area\u2082) = (BX * XC *24)/(4 *12(a -x)) = (BX * XC *24)/(48(a -x)) = (BX * XC)/(2(a -x))\n\nGiven that R\u2082 =15,\n\n(BX * XC)/(2(a -x)) =15 => BX * XC =30(a -x)\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\n1) For AXD: m*n =26x, where m = AX = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), n = XD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 )\n\n2) For BXC: BX * XC =30(a -x), where BX = sqrt( (x -a)^2 + y\u00b2 ), XC = sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nAlso, from angle AXB being 90\u00b0, we have equation (1):\n\nx(x - a) + y\u00b2 =0.\n\nHmm, so that's three equations, but with variables x, y, a. Maybe we can find relationships between these variables.\n\nLet me also note that triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. So all angles in those triangles are less than 90\u00b0. That might impose some constraints on the sides, but perhaps we can handle that later once we have expressions.\n\nFirst, let me try to work with the equations we have.\n\nStarting with equation (1): x(x - a) + y\u00b2 =0\n\nLet me rearrange that:\n\nx\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 =0 => x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x.\n\nHmm, so that's interesting. The left side is the square of AX (since AX is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)), so (AX)^2 = a x.\n\nTherefore, AX = sqrt(a x). So m = sqrt(a x).\n\nSimilarly, maybe express XD in terms of variables?\n\nXD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 )\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express y in terms of a and x from equation (1). Since equation (1) gives y\u00b2 = a x -x\u00b2. Therefore, y = sqrt(a x -x\u00b2). Wait, but y is positive, so that's okay. So y = sqrt(x(a -x)). Hmm, that's a useful expression.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x => y\u00b2 = a x -x\u00b2 => y = sqrt(x(a -x)). Since y is between 0 and 24, this square root is real as long as x(a -x) \u22650, which since x is between 0 and a, this holds.\n\nTherefore, we can write y = sqrt(x(a -x)), which might be helpful.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute XD:\n\nXD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 )\n\nSubstituting y = sqrt(x(a -x)), this becomes sqrt(x\u00b2 + ( sqrt(x(a -x)) -24 )\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, that might get complicated, but perhaps we can find a way to express m and n in terms of x and a?\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can express m*n.\n\nSince m = AX = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(a x) from equation (1).\n\nWait, that's a good point! Since AX squared is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x, so AX is sqrt(a x). Therefore, m = sqrt(a x).\n\nSimilarly, n = XD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 )\n\nBut y = sqrt(x(a -x)), so let's plug that in:\n\nXD = sqrt( x\u00b2 + ( sqrt(x(a -x)) -24 )\u00b2 )\n\nLet me expand that term:\n\nLet me denote z = sqrt(x(a -x)), so XD becomes sqrt(x\u00b2 + (z -24)^2 )\n\nBut z\u00b2 =x(a -x), so perhaps there's a way to simplify.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute XD squared:\n\nXD\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -48 y +24\u00b2\n\nBut from equation (1), x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x, so substituting:\n\nXD\u00b2 = (a x) -48 y + 576\n\nTherefore, XD = sqrt(a x -48 y +576 )\n\nHmm, so n = sqrt(a x -48 y +576 )\n\nBut we can also express y in terms of x and a: y = sqrt(x(a -x))\n\nThus, n = sqrt(a x -48 sqrt(x(a -x)) +576 )\n\nHmm, that's still complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nNow, going back to the equation for AXD's circumradius:\n\nm * n =26x\n\nWe have m = sqrt(a x), and n is sqrt(a x -48 y +576 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nsqrt(a x) * sqrt(a x -48 y +576 ) =26x\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(a x)(a x -48 y +576 ) = (26x)^2 = 676 x\u00b2\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na x [ a x -48 y +576 ] = a\u00b2 x\u00b2 -48 a x y +576 a x\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u00b2 x\u00b2 -48 a x y +576 a x = 676 x\u00b2\n\nHmm, let's rearrange terms:\n\na\u00b2 x\u00b2 -48 a x y +576 a x -676 x\u00b2 =0\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe we can find another equation from the other triangle's condition?\n\nLet me also look at the BXC triangle's condition.\n\nFirst, BX is sqrt( (x -a)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, XC is sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSo BX * XC = sqrt( [ (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ] [ (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] )\n\nThe equation from the circumradius is that this product equals 30(a -x). \n\nHmm, that's another complicated equation. Let me see if we can find substitutions here as well.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate variables through coordinates and the given conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider coordinates for X such that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so X lies on the circle with diameter AB? Wait, no. Wait, if angle AXB is 90\u00b0, then X lies on the circle whose diameter is AB. Wait, is that true?\n\nWait, in general, the locus of points X such that angle AXB is 90\u00b0 is the circle with diameter AB. Since AB is from (0,0) to (a,0), so the midpoint is (a/2, 0), and radius a/2. However, the circle equation would be (x -a/2)^2 + y^2 = (a/2)^2, which simplifies to x\u00b2 -a x + y\u00b2 =0, which is exactly equation (1)! So equation (1) is the equation of the circle with diameter AB. But since X is inside the rectangle, it must lie inside this circle as well. So X is on the circle with diameter AB, and inside the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, that gives us another perspective. So the coordinates of X must lie on that circle, so equation (1) is necessary.\n\nHmm, perhaps using coordinate system and parametrizing X on that circle?\n\nAlternatively, since we have y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2, so y = sqrt(x(a -x)), so perhaps we can parametrize x as a parameter between 0 and a, and express y in terms of x. Then, we can write all variables in terms of x and a, and try to set up equations.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote t = x. Then, since 0 < t <a, and y = sqrt(t(a - t)). \n\nSo, first, let's express all terms in terms of t and a.\n\nStarting with triangle AXD's equation:\n\nWe have m = sqrt(a t), and n = XD = sqrt( a t -48 y +576 )\n\nWait, earlier, XD squared was a t -48 y +576 ?\n\nWait, let me recheck that:\n\nEarlier, we had:\n\nXD squared = a t -48 y +576 ?\n\nWait, yes:\n\nEarlier, XD squared was equal to (a x) -48 y +576, since x is t here. So XD squared = a t -48 y +576.\n\nBut since y = sqrt(t(a - t)), then:\n\nXD squared = a t -48 sqrt(t(a -t)) +576\n\nTherefore, n = sqrt(a t -48 sqrt(t(a -t)) +576 )\n\nTherefore, the equation m * n =26 t becomes:\n\nsqrt(a t) * sqrt( a t -48 sqrt(t(a -t)) +576 ) =26 t\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na t [ a t -48 sqrt(t(a -t)) +576 ] = 676 t\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by t (since t \u22600):\n\na [ a t -48 sqrt(t(a -t)) +576 ] =676 t\n\nHmm, this is getting quite involved, but maybe manageable. Let me note that sqrt(t(a -t)) can be written as y, which is sqrt(t(a -t)).\n\nLet me denote s = sqrt(t(a - t)). So s = y.\n\nThen, s\u00b2 = t(a - t).\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\na [ a t -48 s +576 ] =676 t\n\nLet me write this as:\n\na\u00b2 t -48 a s +576 a =676 t\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express s in terms of a and t? Not directly, but maybe we can find another equation from triangle BXC?\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor triangle BXC, the equation is BX * XC =30(a - t). Let me compute BX and XC.\n\nFirst, BX is sqrt( (t - a)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\n= sqrt( (a - t)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, XC is sqrt( (a - t)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSo, let me compute BX * XC:\n\nsqrt( (a - t)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a - t)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nLet me denote d = a - t, so d = a - t, which is between 0 and a since t is between 0 and a.\n\nTherefore, d is the distance from x-coordinate of X to the side B.\n\nThen, BX = sqrt(d\u00b2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC = sqrt( d\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nTherefore, BX * XC = sqrt( [d\u00b2 + y\u00b2][d\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2] )\n\nLet me compute the product inside the square root:\n\n[d\u00b2 + y\u00b2][d\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ]\n\nFirst, expand each term:\n\nFirst term: d\u00b2 + y\u00b2\n\nSecond term: d\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = d\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 -48 y + y\u00b2\n\nMultiply them together:\n\n(d\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(d\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 576 -48 y )\n\nLet me set z = d\u00b2 + y\u00b2, so the product becomes z(z +576 -48 y )\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be expressed in terms of variables we have.\n\nAlternatively, expanding the product directly:\n\nLet me denote term1 = d\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nterm2 = d\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = d\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 -48 y + y\u00b2.\n\nMultiply term1 and term2:\n\n(term1)(term2) = (d\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(d\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 576 -48 y )\n\nLet me let A = d\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nthen (A)(A + 576 -48 y )\n\nSo,\n\n= A\u00b2 + (576 -48 y)A\n\nHmm, but A is d\u00b2 + y\u00b2. Since d = a - t, and t is x, so d = a -x = a - t,\n\nthen d\u00b2 = (a - t)^2 = a\u00b2 -2 a t + t\u00b2,\n\nand y\u00b2 = t(a - t),\n\nso A = d\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 -2 a t + t\u00b2) + t(a -t) = a\u00b2 -2 a t + t\u00b2 + a t -t\u00b2 = a\u00b2 -a t.\n\nTherefore, A = a\u00b2 -a t.\n\nTherefore, the product becomes:\n\n[A]^2 + (576 -48 y)A\n\n= (a\u00b2 -a t)^2 + (576 -48 y)(a\u00b2 -a t)\n\nTherefore, the product term under the square root is:\n\n(a\u00b2 -a t)^2 + (576 -48 y)(a\u00b2 -a t)\n\nTherefore, BX * XC = sqrt( [ (a\u00b2 -a t)^2 + (576 -48 y)(a\u00b2 -a t) ] )\n\nHmm, this is still complex, but perhaps plugging in y = sqrt(t(a -t)) can help?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since we have from the BXC condition:\n\nBX * XC =30(a - t)\n\nTherefore, the expression sqrt( [ (a\u00b2 -a t)^2 + (576 -48 y)(a\u00b2 -a t) ] ) =30(a - t)\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n[ (a\u00b2 -a t)^2 + (576 -48 y)(a\u00b2 -a t) ] = 900(a -t)^2\n\nFactor out (a\u00b2 -a t):\n\n(a\u00b2 -a t)[ (a\u00b2 -a t) + (576 -48 y) ] = 900(a -t)^2\n\nLet me compute the terms inside the brackets:\n\n(a\u00b2 -a t) +576 -48 y = a\u00b2 -a t +576 -48 y\n\nHmm, so the equation becomes:\n\n(a\u00b2 -a t)(a\u00b2 -a t +576 -48 y ) = 900 (a -t)^2\n\nHmm, this is getting very involved. Maybe I need to find another approach here. Let me see if I can find equations that can be combined.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the coordinates of X and use the conditions that triangles AXD and BXC are acute.\n\nWait, the problem states that both triangles are acute, so all angles in triangle AXD are less than 90\u00b0, and similarly for BXC.\n\nIn triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD=24. The triangle is acute, so by the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, the square of each side must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSo for triangle AXD:\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2,\n\nAX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > XD\u00b2,\n\nXD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > AX\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nMaybe this can help us find some constraints. Let me see.\n\nStarting with triangle AXD:\n\nFirst condition: AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2.\n\nCompute AX\u00b2 = a x (from equation (1)), XD\u00b2 = a x -48 y + 576 (from earlier). AD\u00b2 =24\u00b2=576.\n\nTherefore,\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 = a x + (a x -48 y +576 ) = 2 a x -48 y +576.\n\nSet this greater than 576:\n\n2 a x -48 y +576 >576 => 2 a x -48 y >0 => a x -24 y >0.\n\nSimilarly, second condition: AX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > XD\u00b2\n\nAX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 = a x +576,\n\nXD\u00b2 = a x -48 y +576.\n\nThus,\n\na x +576 > a x -48 y +576\n\nSubtract a x +576 from both sides:\n\n0 > -48 y => 48 y >0, which is true since y>0.\n\nThird condition: XD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > AX\u00b2\n\nXD\u00b2 +576 > AX\u00b2\n\nXD\u00b2 = a x -48 y +576,\n\nThus,\n\n( a x -48 y +576 ) +576 > a x,\n\nSimplify:\n\na x -48 y +576 +576 >a x,\n\nSo,\n\n-48 y +1152 >0 => -48 y > -1152 => y <24.\n\nWhich is true since X is inside the rectangle, so y <24. So that holds.\n\nTherefore, the only non-trivial condition from AXD's acuteness is a x -24 y >0.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, let's check the conditions.\n\nSides: BX, XC, BC=24.\n\nFirst condition: BX\u00b2 + XC\u00b2 > BC\u00b2,\n\nSecond: BX\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 > XC\u00b2,\n\nThird: XC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 > BX\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute BX\u00b2 and XC\u00b2.\n\nBX\u00b2 = (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2,\n\nXC\u00b2 = (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2,\n\nBC\u00b2 =24\u00b2=576.\n\nFirst condition:\n\nBX\u00b2 + XC\u00b2 > BC\u00b2\n\nCompute BX\u00b2 + XC\u00b2:\n\n[(a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ] + [ (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ]\n\n=2(a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2\n\nExpand (24 - y)^2 =576 -48 y + y\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n2(a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 +576 -48 y + y\u00b2\n\n= 2(a -x)^2 +2 y\u00b2 -48 y +576\n\nThis must be greater than 576,\n\nThus,\n\n2(a -x)^2 +2 y\u00b2 -48 y >0,\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n(a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 -24 y >0.\n\nHmm, let's see if this is true. Let me note that (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 -24 y = (a -x)^2 + (y\u00b2 -24 y +144) -144 = (a -x)^2 + (y -12)^2 -144. Hmm, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can relate this to existing equations.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if the other conditions give further constraints.\n\nSecond condition for BXC: BX\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 > XC\u00b2,\n\nCompute BX\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = [ (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ] +576,\n\nXC\u00b2 = (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2,\n\nSo,\n\n( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) +576 > (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2,\n\nSubtract (a -x)^2 from both sides,\n\ny\u00b2 +576 > (24 - y)^2,\n\nExpand (24 - y)^2 =576 -48 y + y\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\ny\u00b2 +576 >576 -48 y + y\u00b2,\n\nCancel terms,\n\n576 >576 -48 y,\n\n0> -48 y => y>0, which holds.\n\nThird condition: XC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 > BX\u00b2,\n\nXC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 = [ (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] +576,\n\nBX\u00b2 = (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) +576 > (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2,\n\nSubtract (a -x)^2 from both sides,\n\n(24 - y)^2 +576 > y\u00b2,\n\nExpand (24 - y)^2,\n\n576 -48 y + y\u00b2 +576 > y\u00b2,\n\nSimplify,\n\n1152 -48 y >0,\n\nWhich is equivalent to y <24, which holds since X is inside the rectangle. So, the only non-trivial condition here is (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 -24 y >0, which must hold.\n\nTherefore, from the acuteness conditions, we have:\n\nFor AXD: a x -24 y >0,\n\nFor BXC: (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 -24 y >0,\n\nThese might be important constraints, but perhaps we can proceed with the equations from the circumradius first and see if they can be solved, then check these conditions.\n\nGoing back to the equations:\n\nFrom AXD's equation:\n\nEquation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x,\n\nEquation (from AXD circumradius):\n\nsqrt(a x) * sqrt( a x -48 y +576 ) =26x,\n\nand from BXC's equation:\n\nsqrt( [ (a -x)^2 + y^2 ][ (a -x)^2 + (24 -y)^2 ]) =30(a -x).\n\nHmm, perhaps instead of dealing with square roots, let me try to find some substitution or relation between the equations.\n\nAlternatively, notice that in equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x. So, AX squared is a x, so AX = sqrt(a x). Similarly, in the BXC case, BX squared is (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2. Let me compute that:\n\nBX\u00b2 = (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 =a\u00b2 -2 a x +x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. But from equation (1), x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x, so substituting:\n\nBX\u00b2 =a\u00b2 -2 a x +a x =a\u00b2 -a x.\n\nSimilarly, XC squared is (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2. Let me compute that:\n\nXC\u00b2 = (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 =a\u00b2 -2 a x +x\u00b2 + 576 -48 y + y\u00b2.\n\nAgain, substitute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x,\n\nXC\u00b2 =a\u00b2 -2 a x +a x +576 -48 y =a\u00b2 -a x +576 -48 y.\n\nTherefore, BX\u00b2 =a\u00b2 -a x,\n\nXC\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 -a x) +576 -48 y,\n\nTherefore, XC\u00b2 = BX\u00b2 +576 -48 y.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. Let me note that.\n\nSo, XC\u00b2 = BX\u00b2 +576 -48 y.\n\nTherefore, XC = sqrt(BX\u00b2 +576 -48 y )\n\nTherefore, the product BX * XC = BX * sqrt(BX\u00b2 +576 -48 y )\n\nHmm, but this may not be helpful right away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider variables substitution.\n\nLet me denote u = a x,\n\nand v = (a -x),\n\nso that u + v =a (since x + (a -x)=a). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that from equation (1): y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2,\n\nso y = sqrt(x(a -x)). Let me denote this as y = sqrt(x(a -x)).\n\nLet me see if I can express 48 y in terms of u.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try plugging in some variable.\n\nWait, let me try to consider equations from AXD and BXC.\n\nFirst, from AXD's equation:\n\nsqrt(a x) * sqrt( a x -48 y +576 ) =26x,\n\nLet me denote that as equation (A):\n\nsqrt(a x) * sqrt( a x -48 y +576 ) =26x,\n\nand from BXC's equation:\n\nsqrt( [ (a -x)^2 + y^2 ][ (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ]) =30(a -x).\n\nLet me denote that as equation (B):\n\nsqrt( [ (a -x)^2 + y^2 ][ (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ]) =30(a -x).\n\nLet me see if I can express these equations in terms of variables that can be related.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take equation (A) and equation (B), and square them to remove the square roots, then try to find a relation between them.\n\nStarting with equation (A):\n\nsqrt(a x) * sqrt( a x -48 y +576 ) =26x,\n\nSquare both sides:\n\na x (a x -48 y +576 ) = 676 x\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by x (assuming x \u22600):\n\na (a x -48 y +576 ) =676 x,\n\nExpand:\n\na\u00b2 x -48 a y +576 a =676 x,\n\nRearranged:\n\na\u00b2 x -676 x -48 a y +576 a =0,\n\nFactor x terms:\n\nx(a\u00b2 -676) -48 a y +576 a =0,\n\nHmm, let me note this as equation (A1).\n\nNow, equation (B):\n\nsqrt( [ (a -x)^2 + y^2 ][ (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ]) =30(a -x),\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[ (a -x)^2 + y^2 ][ (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] =900(a -x)^2,\n\nLet me denote d = a -x,\n\nthen the equation becomes:\n\n[ d\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ][ d\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ] =900 d\u00b2,\n\nExpand the left-hand side:\n\n= (d\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(d\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst term: d\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nSecond term: d\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = d\u00b2 +576 -48 y + y\u00b2,\n\nMultiply them:\n\n(d\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(d\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +576 -48 y )\n\nLet me let z = d\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nthen this becomes z(z +576 -48 y )\n\nBut z =d\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2,\n\nwhich from earlier, BX squared is z =a\u00b2 -a x,\n\nsince BX\u00b2 = (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 =a\u00b2 -a x,\n\nSo z =a\u00b2 -a x,\n\nTherefore, the left-hand side becomes:\n\nz(z +576 -48 y ) = (a\u00b2 -a x)(a\u00b2 -a x +576 -48 y )\n\nThus,\n\n(a\u00b2 -a x)(a\u00b2 -a x +576 -48 y ) =900 d\u00b2 =900(a -x)^2,\n\nSo,\n\n(a\u00b2 -a x)[a\u00b2 -a x +576 -48 y] =900(a -x)^2,\n\nHmm, note that (a -x)^2 = d\u00b2,\n\nand a\u00b2 -a x = z,\n\nSo,\n\nz(z +576 -48 y ) =900 d\u00b2,\n\nBut z =a\u00b2 -a x,\n\nand d =a -x,\n\nLet me see if I can express 576 -48 y in terms of other variables.\n\nWait, from equation (A1):\n\na\u00b2 x -676 x -48 a y +576 a =0,\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n-48 a y = -a\u00b2 x +676 x -576 a,\n\nDivide both sides by -48 a:\n\ny = (a\u00b2 x -676 x +576 a)/(48 a),\n\nHmm, so y can be expressed in terms of x and a. Maybe substitute this into the other equations.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can express 576 -48 y as follows:\n\n576 -48 y =576 -48*( (a\u00b2 x -676 x +576 a)/(48 a) )\n\n=576 - [ (a\u00b2 x -676 x +576 a)/a ]\n\n=576 - (a x - (676/a)x +576 )\n\n=576 -a x + (676/a)x -576\n\n= -a x + (676/a)x\n\n= x( -a +676/a )\n\nHmm, that's interesting.\n\nSo,\n\n576 -48 y =x( -a +676/a )\n\nTherefore, substituting back into equation (B1):\n\nz(z +576 -48 y ) =900 d\u00b2,\n\nwhere z =a\u00b2 -a x,\n\nand 576 -48 y =x( -a +676/a )\n\nTherefore,\n\n(z)( z +x( -a +676/a )) =900 d\u00b2,\n\nBut z =a\u00b2 -a x,\n\nand d =a -x,\n\nSo,\n\n(a\u00b2 -a x)[ (a\u00b2 -a x) +x(-a +676/a) ] =900 (a -x)^2,\n\nLet me compute the term inside the brackets:\n\n(a\u00b2 -a x) +x(-a +676/a )\n\n= a\u00b2 -a x -a x + (676/a)x\n\n= a\u00b2 -2 a x + (676/a)x\n\nHmm, let me factor terms:\n\n= a\u00b2 -2a x + (676 x)/a,\n\nAlternatively, let me write all terms over a:\n\n= (a\u00b3 -2a\u00b2 x +676 x)/a,\n\nSo,\n\nThe left-hand side becomes:\n\n(a\u00b2 -a x) * [ (a\u00b3 -2a\u00b2 x +676 x)/a ] =900 (a -x)^2,\n\nMultiply numerator terms:\n\n(a\u00b2 -a x)(a\u00b3 -2a\u00b2 x +676 x ) /a =900 (a -x)^2,\n\nHmm, this is getting very algebraically intense. Perhaps there is a better substitution or approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that a is an integer? Since the problem is asking for AB, which is 'a', and the circumradii are 13 and 15, which are integers, perhaps a is an integer as well. Maybe trying to find integer solutions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that AXD's circumradius is 13, and since in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, AD=24. Let me denote the sides as follows:\n\nLet me denote in triangle AXD,\n\nside a = AX = sqrt(a x),\n\nside b = XD = sqrt( a x -48 y +576 ),\n\nside c = AD =24,\n\nThen the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area). We know Area is 12x, so:\n\n13 = ( sqrt(a x) * sqrt(a x -48 y +576 ) *24 )/(4*12x )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12x=48x,\n\nNumerator: 24* sqrt(a x)*sqrt(a x -48 y +576 )\n\nThus,\n\n13 = [24 * sqrt(a x (a x -48 y +576 )) ] /48x,\n\nSimplify fraction: 24/48 = 1/2,\n\nThus,\n\n13 = [ sqrt(a x (a x -48 y +576 )) ]/(2x),\n\nMultiply both sides by 2x,\n\n26x = sqrt(a x (a x -48 y +576 )),\n\nWhich is exactly the equation we had before (equation A), so that's consistent.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to find a relation between the two equations (A1) and (B1).\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can find expressions for a in terms of x or vice versa.\n\nFrom equation (A1):\n\na\u00b2 x -676 x -48 a y +576 a =0,\n\nLet me factor terms with a\u00b2 and a:\n\na\u00b2 x -48 a y +576 a -676 x =0,\n\nFactor a terms:\n\na( a x -48 y +576 ) -676 x =0,\n\nBut from equation (A):\n\nsqrt(a x) * sqrt( a x -48 y +576 ) =26x,\n\nLet me denote sqrt(a x) = m,\n\nthen sqrt( a x -48 y +576 ) =26x / m =26x / sqrt(a x).\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(a x -48 y +576 ) =26x / sqrt(a x),\n\nSquare both sides,\n\na x -48 y +576 = (26x)^2 / (a x),\n\nMultiply both sides by a x,\n\n(a x)(a x -48 y +576 ) = 676 x\u00b2,\n\nWhich is the original equation (A) squared, so that's consistent.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to make a substitution here. Let me consider the expression from equation (A1):\n\na\u00b2 x -48 a y +576 a -676 x =0,\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\na\u00b2 x +576 a -48 a y =676 x,\n\nFactor a from the first three terms:\n\na( a x +576 -48 y ) =676 x,\n\nTherefore,\n\na = (676 x)/(a x +576 -48 y )\n\nHmm, but this still has a on both sides.\n\nAlternatively, from equation (A):\n\nsqrt(a x) * sqrt( a x -48 y +576 ) =26x,\n\nLet me denote sqrt(a x) as m,\n\nthen sqrt( a x -48 y +576 ) =26x/m,\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt( a x -48 y +576 ) =26x/m,\n\nBut m =sqrt(a x),\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt( a x -48 y +576 ) =26x/(sqrt(a x)),\n\nSquare both sides,\n\na x -48 y +576 = (26x)^2/(a x),\n\nMultiply both sides by a x,\n\n(a x)^2 -48 a x y +576 a x =676x\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by x (assuming x\u22600),\n\na\u00b2 x -48 a y +576 a =676x,\n\nWhich is exactly equation (A1). So no progress here.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's time to consider that this might be a problem designed with integer lengths, and perhaps the Pythagorean triples involved with the circumradii.\n\nGiven that the circumradius for AXD is 13, which is part of the 5-12-13 triangle, and 15 is part of 8-15-17 or 9-12-15, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sides of triangle AXD form a Pythagorean triple with the circumradius 13, so their sides must be multiples such that their product over 4*Area equals 13.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the formula for circumradius in terms of sides: R = abc/(4K). For triangle AXD, sides are AX, XD, AD=24. So,\n\n13 = (AX * XD *24)/(4 * Area AXD),\n\nWe know Area AXD is 12x, so:\n\n13 = (AX * XD *24)/(48x),\n\nThus,\n\nAX * XD = (13 * 48x)/24 =13*2x=26x,\n\nWhich matches the previous equation, so that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC with R=15,\n\n15 = (BX * XC *24)/(4 * Area BXC),\n\nArea BXC is12(a -x),\n\nThus,\n\n15 = (BX * XC *24)/(48(a -x)),\n\nSo,\n\nBX * XC = (15 *48(a -x))/24 =30(a -x),\n\nWhich is also consistent with previous.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a way to find AX and XD such that their product is 26x, and similarly for BXC.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of coordinates and set variables such that equations can be combined.\n\nLet me try to consider the two equations:\n\nFrom AXD:\n\nsqrt(a x) * sqrt(a x -48 y +576 ) =26x,\n\nand from BXC:\n\nsqrt( [ (a -x)^2 + y^2 ][ (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ]) =30(a -x).\n\nLet me see if I can express (a -x)^2 + y^2 and (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 in terms of variables from AXD.\n\nWait, (a -x)^2 + y^2 is BX squared, which we found earlier to be a\u00b2 -a x,\n\nSimilarly, (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = XC squared = a\u00b2 -a x +576 -48 y,\n\nThus, the product under the square root in equation (B) is (a\u00b2 -a x)(a\u00b2 -a x +576 -48 y).\n\nWhich is exactly the same as the left-hand side of the squared equation (B1). So,\n\nsqrt( (a\u00b2 -a x)(a\u00b2 -a x +576 -48 y) ) =30(a -x),\n\nWhich squared gives:\n\n(a\u00b2 -a x)(a\u00b2 -a x +576 -48 y) =900(a -x)^2,\n\nHmm, but notice that in equation (A1), we have:\n\na\u00b2 x -48 a y +576 a =676x,\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to solve for (a\u00b2 -a x):\n\nWait, equation (A1):\n\na\u00b2 x -48 a y +576 a =676x,\n\nLet me move all terms to the left:\n\na\u00b2 x -48 a y +576 a -676x =0,\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms with a\u00b2 and x terms:\n\na\u00b2 x -676x -48 a y +576 a =0,\n\nFactor x terms:\n\nx(a\u00b2 -676) +a(-48 y +576)=0,\n\nHmm,\n\nMaybe factor out a from the last terms:\n\nx(a\u00b2 -676) +a*(-48 y +576)=0,\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables substitution. Let me set k = a x,\n\nthen from equation (1), y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2 =k -x\u00b2,\n\nso y = sqrt(k -x\u00b2).\n\nHmm, but then, perhaps this isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that from equation (1): y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2,\n\nso y = sqrt( x(a -x) ),\n\nso perhaps express everything in terms of x and a.\n\nLet me attempt to write equation (A1):\n\na\u00b2 x -48 a y +576 a =676x,\n\nExpress y as sqrt(x(a -x)),\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 x -48 a sqrt(x(a -x)) +576 a =676x,\n\nThis equation involves a and x, but it's still complex. Maybe assume that a is an integer, and try to find integer solutions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables to simplify.\n\nLet me denote t =x/a. Since x is between 0 and a, then t is between 0 and1. Let me set t =x/a, so x =a t,\n\nthen y = sqrt(a x -x\u00b2 ) = sqrt(a*(a t) - (a t)^2 ) =a sqrt( t -t\u00b2 ).\n\nTherefore, let me define s = sqrt(t -t\u00b2 ), so y =a s,\n\nThus, y =a s,\n\nwith s = sqrt(t(1 -t)),\n\nsince t =x/a,\n\nso s is between 0 and 0.5 (maximum at t=0.5).\n\nHmm, this substitution might help.\n\nLet me substitute x =a t and y =a s into equations (A1) and (B1).\n\nFirst, equation (A1):\n\na\u00b2 x -48 a y +576 a =676x,\n\nSubstitute x =a t, y =a s,\n\nLeft side:\n\na\u00b2*(a t) -48 a*(a s) +576 a = a\u00b3 t -48 a\u00b2 s +576 a,\n\nRight side:\n\n676*(a t),\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u00b3 t -48 a\u00b2 s +576 a =676 a t,\n\nDivide both sides by a (a \u22600):\n\na\u00b2 t -48 a s +576 =676 t,\n\nRearranged:\n\na\u00b2 t -676 t -48 a s +576 =0,\n\nFactor t:\n\nt(a\u00b2 -676) -48 a s +576 =0,\n\nHmm, equation (A2).\n\nNow, equation (B1):\n\n(a\u00b2 -a x)(a\u00b2 -a x +576 -48 y ) =900(a -x)^2,\n\nAgain substitute x =a t, y =a s,\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\na\u00b2 -a x =a\u00b2 -a*(a t)=a\u00b2(1 -t),\n\nSimilarly, 576 -48 y =576 -48*(a s),\n\nThus,\n\nthe first factor: a\u00b2(1 -t),\n\nthe second factor: a\u00b2(1 -t) +576 -48 a s,\n\nThus,\n\nleft side:\n\na\u00b2(1 -t)[a\u00b2(1 -t) +576 -48 a s ] =900(a -a t)^2,\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n900 a\u00b2(1 -t)^2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2(1 -t)[a\u00b2(1 -t) +576 -48 a s ] =900 a\u00b2(1 -t)^2,\n\nDivide both sides by a\u00b2(1 -t), assuming a \u22600 and 1 -t \u22600 (which holds since x <a so t <1),\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2(1 -t) +576 -48 a s =900(1 -t),\n\nRearrange terms,\n\na\u00b2(1 -t) -900(1 -t) +576 -48 a s=0,\n\nFactor (1 -t):\n\n(1 -t)(a\u00b2 -900) +576 -48 a s =0,\n\nEquation (B2).\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n(A2): t(a\u00b2 -676) -48 a s +576 =0,\n\n(B2): (1 -t)(a\u00b2 -900) +576 -48 a s =0,\n\nLet me write them again:\n\nEquation (A2):\n\nt(a\u00b2 -676) -48 a s +576 =0,\n\nEquation (B2):\n\n(1 -t)(a\u00b2 -900) +576 -48 a s =0,\n\nNotice that both equations have the term -48 a s. Let me subtract equation (A2) from equation (B2):\n\n[ (1 -t)(a\u00b2 -900) +576 -48 a s ] - [ t(a\u00b2 -676) -48 a s +576 ] =0 -0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1 -t)(a\u00b2 -900) +576 -48 a s -t(a\u00b2 -676) +48 a s -576 =0,\n\nThe -48 a s and +48 a s cancel,\n\n576 -576 cancel,\n\nExpand the remaining terms:\n\n(1 -t)(a\u00b2 -900) - t(a\u00b2 -676) =0,\n\nExpand (1 -t)(a\u00b2 -900):\n\n= a\u00b2 -900 -t a\u00b2 +900 t,\n\nThen subtract t(a\u00b2 -676):\n\n= a\u00b2 -900 -t a\u00b2 +900 t -t a\u00b2 +676 t,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na\u00b2 -900 -2 t a\u00b2 + (900 t +676 t),\n\n= a\u00b2 -900 -2 t a\u00b2 +1576 t,\n\nFactor terms with t:\n\n= a\u00b2 -900 + t(-2 a\u00b2 +1576),\n\nSet equal to zero:\n\na\u00b2 -900 + t(-2 a\u00b2 +1576)=0,\n\nSolve for t:\n\nt(-2 a\u00b2 +1576)=900 -a\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nt = (900 -a\u00b2)/( -2 a\u00b2 +1576 ) = (a\u00b2 -900)/(2 a\u00b2 -1576),\n\nHmm, so t = (a\u00b2 -900)/(2 a\u00b2 -1576).\n\nNow, we can plug this expression for t into equation (A2) to solve for a.\n\nRecall equation (A2):\n\nt(a\u00b2 -676) -48 a s +576 =0,\n\nWe need to express s in terms of a and t.\n\nRecall that s = sqrt(t(1 -t)),\n\nsince s = sqrt(t -t\u00b2) = sqrt(t(1 -t)).\n\nTherefore, s = sqrt(t(1 -t)),\n\nSo,\n\n-48 a s = -48 a sqrt(t(1 -t)),\n\nThus, equation (A2):\n\nt(a\u00b2 -676) -48 a sqrt(t(1 -t)) +576 =0,\n\nNow, substituting t = (a\u00b2 -900)/(2 a\u00b2 -1576),\n\nLet me denote numerator as N =a\u00b2 -900,\n\ndenominator D =2a\u00b2 -1576,\n\nso t = N/D,\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term: t(a\u00b2 -676) = (N/D)(a\u00b2 -676),\n\nSecond term: -48 a sqrt(t(1 -t)),\n\nThird term: +576.\n\nThus,\n\n(N/D)(a\u00b2 -676) -48 a sqrt(t(1 -t)) +576 =0,\n\nThis equation is quite complex. Maybe we can find a value of a that makes the terms manageable. Let me try to see if a is an integer, perhaps a multiple of 12 or 24?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that a is an integer and look for a such that t is rational, and the square roots become manageable.\n\nAlternatively, notice that in the expression for t,\n\nt = (a\u00b2 -900)/(2a\u00b2 -1576).\n\nLet me rearrange numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me write denominator as 2a\u00b2 -1576 =2(a\u00b2 -788),\n\nNumerator: a\u00b2 -900,\n\nSo,\n\nt = (a\u00b2 -900)/(2(a\u00b2 -788)),\n\nHmm, perhaps set a\u00b2 =k,\n\nthen t=(k -900)/(2(k -788)),\n\nLet me see if this can be simplified or if there's a value k such that numerator and denominator are multiples that result in t between 0 and1.\n\nSince t must be between 0 and1,\n\n0 < (k -900)/(2(k -788)) <1,\n\nFirst, the denominator 2(k -788):\n\nThe sign of denominator and numerator must be same for t positive.\n\nCase 1: denominator positive, so k -788 >0 =>k>788,\n\nthen numerator k-900 >0 =>k>900,\n\nso when k>900,\n\nthen t=(positive)/(positive) >0,\n\nand to have t <1,\n\n(k -900)/(2(k -788)) <1,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2(k -788) (positive):\n\nk -900 <2(k -788),\n\nk -900 <2k -1576,\n\n-900 +1576 <k,\n\n676 <k,\n\nWhich is satisfied since k>900,\n\nThus, for k>900, t is between (900-900)/(something) up to... but actually, as k increases, t approaches 1/2.\n\nWait, let me compute limit as k approaches infinity,\n\nt \u2248k/(2k) =1/2,\n\nSo for large k, t approaches 1/2.\n\nAlternatively, if denominator negative:\n\ndenominator 2(k -788) <0 =>k <788,\n\nthen numerator must also be negative for t positive,\n\nso k-900 <0 =>k <900,\n\nThus, if 788> k>0,\n\nthen t is positive,\n\nand t=(k-900)/(2(k-788)),\n\nwhich would be (negative)/(negative)=positive,\n\nand to have t <1,\n\n(k-900)/(2(k-788)) <1,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2(k -788), which is negative,\n\nso inequality flips:\n\nk-900 >2(k -788),\n\nk-900>2k -1576,\n\n-900 -2k +1576 >k,\n\nWait,\n\nWait, let's do it step by step:\n\n(k -900) < 2(k -788)\n\nBut since denominator is negative, multiplying both sides by it reverses inequality:\n\n(k -900) > 2(k -788)\n\n=> k -900 >2k -1576\n\n=> -900 -k > -1576\n\n=> -k > -1576 +900 = -676\n\n=> k <676,\n\nTherefore, in this case, for t<1, we need k <676,\n\nand since in this case k <788,\n\nso overall, for k between 0 and 676,\n\nthen t would be positive and less than1,\n\nBut since x is between 0 and a, then a must be positive,\n\nso k =a\u00b2>0,\n\nThus possible values of a\u00b2 are either between 0 and676 or greater than900,\n\nBut since a is the length AB of the rectangle with BC=24,\n\nprobably a is not too small, but let's see.\n\nPerhaps trying integer values for a.\n\nLet me suppose that a is an integer.\n\nLet me try to see possible a.\n\nSuppose a\u00b2 -900 and 2a\u00b2 -1576 are integers,\n\nso a must be integer.\n\nLet me try a= 30,\n\nthen a\u00b2=900,\n\nthen t=(900-900)/(2*900 -1576)=0/(1800-1576)=0,\n\nso t=0,\n\nthen x =a t=0,\n\nbut then point X would be at (0,y), but then angle AXB would be undefined? Since AX is along the y-axis and BX would be from (0,y) to (30,0), but angle at X?\n\nWait, if X is at (0,y), then vectors AX is (0,y) and BX is ( -30, y),\n\nTheir dot product would be 0*(-30)+ y*y = y\u00b2,\n\nwhich is not zero unless y=0,\n\nbut y= sqrt(x(a -x)) =0,\n\nso y=0,\n\nthus X=(0,0), which is point A,\n\nbut the problem states X is inside the rectangle, so not on the boundary,\n\nTherefore a=30 is invalid.\n\nNext, try a=26,\n\na\u00b2=676,\n\nthen t=(676-900)/(2*676 -1576)= (-224)/(1352-1576)= (-224)/(-224)=1,\n\nso t=1,\n\nthen x=a t=26,\n\ny= sqrt(x(a -x))=sqrt(26*(0))=0,\n\nso X=(26,0), which is point B,\n\nagain on the boundary, invalid.\n\nHmm, next, try a= 32,\n\na\u00b2=1024,\n\nthen,\n\nt=(1024-900)/(2*1024 -1576)=124/(2048-1576)=124/472=31/118\u22480.263,\n\nSo t\u22480.263,\n\nthen x=32*(31/118)= (992)/118\u22488.398,\n\ny= sqrt(x(a -x))=sqrt( (32*(31/118))*(32*(87/118)) ), but this might be messy,\n\nbut let's compute s= sqrt(t(1 -t)),\n\nt\u22480.263,\n\nso 1 -t\u22480.737,\n\ns= sqrt(0.263*0.737)\u2248sqrt(0.194)=0.44,\n\nthen equation (A2):\n\nt(a\u00b2 -676) -48 a s +576 =0,\n\nCompute each term,\n\nt(a\u00b2 -676)= (31/118)(1024 -676)= (31/118)(348)=31*(348/118)=31*(3)=93,\n\nsince 348 \u00f7118=3,\n\nWait 118*3=354, which is more than 348,\n\nWait 118*2=236, 348-236=112,\n\nHmm, maybe miscalculation,\n\nWait 1024-676=348,\n\n348 divided by 118: 118*2=236, 348-236=112, so 348/118= 3 - ( (354-348)/118 )= 3 -6/118\u22482.949,\n\nWait, so 31/118 *348 =31*(348/118)=31*(348 divided by 118),\n\nLet me compute 348 divided by 118: 118*2=236, 348-236=112,\n\n118*0.94\u2248110.52,\n\nHmm, perhaps 348/118 = 2.949,\n\nThus, 31*2.949\u224891.42,\n\n-48 a s =-48*32*0.44\u2248-48*14.08\u2248-675.84,\n\nAdding up: 91.42 -675.84 +576\u224891.42 +576=667.42 -675.84\u2248-8.42,\n\nNot zero.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's being asked. The problem is about a rectangle ABCD with BC = 24. There's a point X inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles A XD and B XC are both acute, and their circumradii are 13 and 15 respectively. I need to find the length of AB. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize this.\n\nFirst, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Let me label the rectangle: Let's say A is the bottom-left corner, B is the bottom-right, C is the top-right, and D is the top-left. So, AB and CD are the bases, and BC and AD are the heights. Given BC = 24, so the height of the rectangle is 24 units. The problem asks for AB, which is the length of the base.\n\nNow, point X is inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. That means if I connect points A to X and B to X, the angle between those two lines at X is a right angle. So, triangle AXB is a right-angled triangle at X. Hmm, but they also mention triangles AX D and BXC. Both of these are acute, and they have circumradii 13 and 15. I need to use that information somehow.\n\nLet me recall that the circumradius of a triangle is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides and A is the area. Alternatively, for a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. Wait, but triangles AX D and BXC are acute, so they aren't right-angled. Hmm. But triangle AXB is right-angled at X. Wait, the problem didn't say AXB is right-angled, but angle AXB is 90 degrees, so that triangle is right-angled at X. So, triangle AXB is right-angled, but triangles AX D and BXC are acute. Got it.\n\nSo, maybe I should set up coordinates to model this. Let's place the rectangle ABCD on a coordinate system. Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let me set point A at (0,0). Then since AB is the base, let me let AB be along the x-axis. So point B would be at (AB, 0). Since BC is 24, the side BC is vertical, so point C is at (AB, 24) and point D is at (0, 24). So coordinates:\n\nA: (0,0)\nB: (a,0) where a = AB (this is what we need to find)\nC: (a,24)\nD: (0,24)\n\nNow, point X is inside the rectangle. Let me denote the coordinates of X as (x,y). So X is (x,y), where 0 < x < a and 0 < y <24.\n\nGiven angle AXB is 90 degrees. That means vectors AX and BX are perpendicular. The vectors AX would be (x, y) - (0,0) = (x,y), and BX would be (x - a, y - 0) = (x -a, y). The dot product of AX and BX should be zero.\n\nSo, the dot product is x*(x - a) + y*y = 0.\n\nSo equation 1: x(x - a) + y\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 = 0.\n\nThat's one equation relating x and y.\n\nNow, the other conditions involve triangles AX D and BXC having circumradii 13 and 15 respectively, and both being acute. Let me tackle each triangle one by one.\n\nFirst, triangle AX D. The vertices are A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). Let me compute the sides of this triangle.\n\nFirst, side AX: distance from A to X is \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSide XD: distance from X to D is \u221a[(x -0)\u00b2 + (y -24)^2] = \u221a(x\u00b2 + (y-24)^2).\n\nSide AD: distance from A to D is 24, since it's the vertical side of the rectangle. Wait, but triangle AX D has sides AX, XD, and AD. Wait, AD is a side of the rectangle, so yes, that's 24. Wait, but in triangle AX D, the sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, but AD is one of the sides? Wait, actually, the triangle is A-X-D, so the three vertices are A, X, D. So the sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, no, AD is a side between A and D, but in the triangle AX D, the sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the triangle AX D has vertices A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). So the three sides are:\n\nAX: from A to X: length \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\nXD: from X to D: \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2),\n\nand AD: from A to D: 24 units. Wait, but A to D is vertical, but in triangle AX D, the side opposite to X would be AD, right?\n\nWait, actually, in triangle AX D, the three sides are:\n\nAX, XD, and AD. But AD is a side of the rectangle, so it's fixed at 24. However, triangle AX D is formed by points A, X, D, so sides are indeed AX, XD, and AD. Wait, but the side between A and D is indeed 24, so that's one side. So the triangle has sides of length \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2), and 24.\n\nSimilarly, triangle BXC has vertices B(a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24). So sides are:\n\nBX: distance from B to X: \u221a[(a - x)^2 + y\u00b2],\n\nXC: distance from X to C: \u221a[(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2],\n\nand BC: 24, since it's the vertical side from B to C. Wait, but triangle BXC has sides BX, XC, and BC (since BC is between B and C). So sides are \u221a[(a - x)^2 + y\u00b2], \u221a[(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2], and 24.\n\nNow, the problem states that both triangles AX D and BXC are acute. So all their angles are less than 90 degrees, which gives certain conditions on their sides. But maybe the key here is the circumradius. Let me recall that the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a,b,c is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area. Alternatively, since the triangles are acute, the circumradius can also be related to the sides via other formulas?\n\nAlternatively, since the triangles are acute, their circumradius can be found using the formula R = a/(2 sin A), where A is the angle opposite side a. Hmm, but perhaps using the standard formula would be better here.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the circumradius for triangle AX D. Let me denote triangle AX D first.\n\nLet me denote the sides:\n\nLet me denote for triangle AX D:\n\nLet\u2019s call the sides as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s define:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s say:\n\nIn triangle AX D:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nSide opposite A is XD: \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2),\n\nSide opposite X is AD: 24,\n\nSide opposite D is AX: \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nWait, actually, in triangle notation, the side opposite vertex A is XD, side opposite X is AD, and side opposite D is AX. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to use standard notation. Let me denote triangle AX D with vertices A, X, D. So sides:\n\nAX, XD, AD. Let me denote them as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let a = XD = \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2),\n\nb = AD = 24,\n\nc = AX = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSo sides are a, b, c with opposite angles A, X, D respectively? Wait, actually, in standard notation, side a is opposite angle A, side b opposite angle B, etc. So here, if the triangle is named AX D, then angle at A is angle between sides AX and AD. So the side opposite angle A would be XD, which is length a = \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2). Similarly, the side opposite angle X is AD (24), and the side opposite angle D is AX (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)). \n\nThe circumradius R of triangle AX D is given as 13. So using the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area. Let me compute \u0394 first. The area of triangle AX D can be computed in a couple of ways. Since points A, X, D are (0,0), (x,y), (0,24). The area is (base * height)/2. The base can be AD which is vertical from (0,0) to (0,24), so length 24, and the height is the horizontal distance from X to the line AD, which is the x-coordinate of X, since AD is the vertical line x=0. So the height is x. Therefore, area \u0394 = (24 * x)/2 = 12x.\n\nAlternatively, using coordinates, the area can be calculated via determinant:\n\nArea = \u00bd | (0*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - y) ) | = \u00bd |0 +24x + 0| = 12x. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, area \u0394 = 12x.\n\nNow, the sides:\n\na = XD = \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2),\n\nb = AD = 24,\n\nc = AX = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nSo, the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4\u0394) = [\u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) * 24 * \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)] / (4 * 12x).\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12x = 48x.\n\nNumerator: 24 * \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) * \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nThus, R = [24 * \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) * \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)] / (48x) = [\u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) * \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)] / (2x).\n\nGiven that R is 13 for triangle AX D, so:\n\n[\u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) * \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)] / (2x) = 13.\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots. Let me denote that equation as:\n\n[\u221a(A) * \u221a(B)] / (2x) = 13, where A = x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 and B = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(A * B)/(4x\u00b2) = 169,\n\nSo A*B = 4x\u00b2 * 169 = 676x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 676x\u00b2.\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, which has circumradius 15. Let me do the same analysis.\n\nTriangle BXC has vertices B(a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24).\n\nFirst, let's compute the sides.\n\nBX: distance from B to X: \u221a[(a - x)^2 + y\u00b2].\n\nXC: distance from X to C: \u221a[(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2].\n\nBC: distance from B to C is 24 (vertical side).\n\nSo sides of triangle BXC are:\n\nBX = \u221a[(a - x)^2 + y\u00b2],\n\nXC = \u221a[(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2],\n\nBC = 24.\n\nLet me denote the sides as:\n\nLet me call:\n\nIn triangle BXC,\n\nLet me denote sides:\n\nLet me call:\n\nside opposite B is XC = \u221a[(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2],\n\nside opposite X is BC = 24,\n\nside opposite C is BX = \u221a[(a - x)^2 + y\u00b2].\n\nFollowing similar notation as before.\n\nThe area of triangle BXC can be calculated similarly. Since points B, X, C are (a,0), (x,y), (a,24).\n\nThe area can be calculated as the base BC (24) times the horizontal distance from X to the line BC (which is vertical at x=a, so the horizontal distance is (a - x)), so area is (24*(a - x))/2 = 12(a - x).\n\nAlternatively, using determinant:\n\nArea = \u00bd | a*(y -24) + x*(24 - 0) + a*(0 - y) | \n\nWait, let me compute that step by step:\n\nCoordinates:\n\nB(a, 0), X(x,y), C(a,24)\n\nArea = \u00bd | (a*(y -24) + x*(24 - 0) + a*(0 - y)) |\n\n= \u00bd | a(y -24) + 24x + a(-y) | \n\n= \u00bd | a y -24a +24x -a y |\n\n= \u00bd | -24a +24x | \n\n= \u00bd |24(x -a)| = 12 |x -a|.\n\nSince X is inside the rectangle, x < a, so x -a is negative, so absolute value makes it 12(a -x). So area \u0394 = 12(a -x).\n\nSo the area is 12(a -x).\n\nThe sides of triangle BXC are:\n\na' = XC = \u221a[(a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2],\n\nb' = BC =24,\n\nc' = BX = \u221a[(a - x)^2 + y\u00b2].\n\nThus, the circumradius R' for triangle BXC is given by (a'*b'*c')/(4*\u0394).\n\nPlugging in:\n\nR' = [\u221a((a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2) *24*\u221a((a -x)^2 + y\u00b2)] / [4 *12(a -x)]\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12(a -x) = 48(a -x).\n\nNumerator: 24 * \u221a[(a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2] * \u221a[(a -x)^2 + y\u00b2].\n\nThus, R' = [24 * \u221a((a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2) * \u221a((a -x)^2 + y\u00b2)] / [48(a -x)]\n\nSimplify:\n\nR' = [\u221a((a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2) * \u221a((a -x)^2 + y\u00b2)] / [2(a -x)].\n\nGiven that R' is 15, so:\n\n[\u221a((a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2) * \u221a((a -x)^2 + y\u00b2)] / [2(a -x)] =15.\n\nAgain, square both sides:\n\n[ ((a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * ((a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) ] / [4(a -x)^2] = 225.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4(a -x)^2:\n\n[( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * ( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) ] = 900(a -x)^2.\n\nSo that's the second equation.\n\nSo now, we have two equations from the circumradius conditions:\n\nEquation (1): (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 676x\u00b2.\n\nEquation (2): [((a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2)((a -x)^2 + y\u00b2)] = 900(a -x)^2.\n\nAdditionally, we have the condition that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, which gave us:\n\nEquation (3): x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSo we have three equations with variables x, y, a. We need to solve for a, which is AB.\n\nThis seems quite involved. Let me see if I can find a way to relate these equations.\n\nFirst, perhaps express a from equation (3). From equation (3):\n\nx\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 =0 \u2192 a x = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2192 a = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)/x.\n\nHmm, so a is expressed in terms of x and y. Maybe I can substitute this into equations (1) and (2).\n\nLet me first work with equation (1):\n\nEquation (1):\n\n(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 676x\u00b2.\n\nLet me expand the left-hand side:\n\nLet me denote term1 = x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2,\n\nterm2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nso term1 * term2 = [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2][x\u00b2 + y\u00b2].\n\nLet me compute that product:\n\n= x\u00b2(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (24 - y)^2 (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n= x^4 + x\u00b2 y\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 y\u00b2\n\nHmm, but perhaps expanding is not the best approach here. Alternatively, maybe note that term1 = x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 and term2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nLet me see if I can factor or find some relation here. Alternatively, maybe consider variables substitution. Let me let u = x and v = y for simplicity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use equation (3) to substitute a = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)/x into equation (2). Let me try that.\n\nEquation (2):\n\n[ ((a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * ( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) ] = 900(a -x)^2.\n\nFirst, note that (a -x) = ( (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)/x -x ) = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2)/x = y\u00b2/x. So (a -x) = y\u00b2/x.\n\nSo substitute (a - x) with y\u00b2/x.\n\nTherefore, equation (2) becomes:\n\n[ ( (y\u00b2/x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * ( (y\u00b2/x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) ] = 900*(y\u00b2/x)^2.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute (a -x)^2 = (y^4)/(x^2).\n\nSo first term inside the first bracket:\n\n(y^4/x\u00b2) + (24 - y)^2,\n\nSecond term inside the second bracket:\n\n(y^4/x\u00b2) + y\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the left-hand side:\n\n[ (y^4/x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * (y^4/x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) ].\n\nThe right-hand side is 900*(y^4/x\u00b2).\n\nHmm, this looks messy. Maybe let me factor terms:\n\nLet me denote z = y^2/x\u00b2. Then y^4/x^4 = z\u00b2, but perhaps that might not help. Alternatively, let me let t = y/x, so y = t x. Then perhaps substituting variables in terms of t.\n\nLet me try that substitution. Let me set t = y/x, so y = t x. Then, since a = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)/x = x + y\u00b2/x = x + (t\u00b2 x\u00b2)/x = x + t\u00b2 x = x(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nThus, a = x(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, variables substitution with t = y/x, so y = t x, a = x(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nThis substitution might simplify the equations. Let me try this approach.\n\nFirst, substitute y = t x into equation (1):\n\nEquation (1):\n\n(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 676x\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute y = t x:\n\n(x\u00b2 + (24 - t x)^2)(x\u00b2 + (t x)^2) = 676x\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst factor:\n\n(x\u00b2 + (24 - t x)^2) = x\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 - 48 t x + t\u00b2 x\u00b2 = (1 + t\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 t x + 576.\n\nSecond factor:\n\n(x\u00b2 + t\u00b2 x\u00b2) = x\u00b2(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nMultiply them together:\n\n[ (1 + t\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 t x + 576 ] * [x\u00b2(1 + t\u00b2)] = 676x\u00b2.\n\nLet me factor out x\u00b2 from the second bracket:\n\n= x\u00b2(1 + t\u00b2) [ (1 + t\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 t x + 576 ] = 676x\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by x\u00b2 (assuming x \u22600, which it isn't because X is inside the rectangle):\n\n(1 + t\u00b2)[ (1 + t\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 t x + 576 ] = 676.\n\nNow, let me write this as:\n\n(1 + t\u00b2)*( (1 + t\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 t x + 576 ) = 676.\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated, but perhaps we can also substitute a in terms of x and t. Since a = x(1 + t\u00b2), perhaps we can express x in terms of a? Not sure yet. Let me hold on that.\n\nNow, let's look at equation (2) with substitution y = t x and a = x(1 + t\u00b2):\n\nEquation (2) after substitution:\n\nLeft side:\n\n[ ( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * ( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) ]\n\nBut (a - x) = a -x = x(1 + t\u00b2) -x = x t\u00b2,\n\nand y = t x,\n\nso 24 - y =24 - t x,\n\nand y\u00b2 = t\u00b2 x\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term inside first bracket: (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = (x\u00b2 t^4) + (24 - t x)^2,\n\nSecond term inside second bracket: (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 t^4) + (t\u00b2 x\u00b2) = x\u00b2 t\u00b2 (t\u00b2 +1).\n\nWait, let me compute each part:\n\nFirst bracket:\n\n(a -x)^2 = (x t\u00b2)^2 = x\u00b2 t^4,\n\n(24 - y)^2 = (24 - t x)^2,\n\nso first part: x\u00b2 t^4 + (24 - t x)^2,\n\nSecond bracket:\n\n(a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 t^4 + t\u00b2 x\u00b2 = x\u00b2(t^4 + t\u00b2) = x\u00b2 t\u00b2(t\u00b2 +1).\n\nTherefore, left-hand side of equation (2):\n\n[ x\u00b2 t^4 + (24 - t x)^2 ) * x\u00b2 t\u00b2 (t\u00b2 +1) ].\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, the first bracket is (x\u00b2 t^4 + (24 - t x)^2 ), and the second bracket is (x\u00b2 t^4 + t\u00b2 x\u00b2 ) =x\u00b2(t^4 + t\u00b2).\n\nSo the entire left-hand side is:\n\n[ x\u00b2 t^4 + (24 - t x)^2 ] * [x\u00b2(t^4 + t\u00b2)].\n\nAnd the right-hand side was 900*(a -x)^2 = 900*(x\u00b2 t^4).\n\nSo equation (2) becomes:\n\n[ x\u00b2 t^4 + (24 - t x)^2 ] * [x\u00b2(t^4 + t\u00b2)] = 900 x\u00b2 t^4.\n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe I need to find another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice some symmetry or make substitutions based on equations (1) and (2). Let me think.\n\nLet me recall that in equation (1):\n\n(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 676x\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote S = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nThen, since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, from equation (3):\n\nx\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 =0 \u2192 S = a x.\n\nTherefore, S = a x.\n\nSo substituting S into equation (1):\n\n(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)(S) = 676x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)(a x) = 676x\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by x (assuming x \u22600):\n\n(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)a = 676x.\n\nTherefore,\n\na = (676x)/(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2).\n\nSimilarly, perhaps for equation (2):\n\nLet me try to apply similar substitutions. Let me denote T = (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps let me consider the terms in equation (2). Let me denote for triangle BXC:\n\nThe equation came from:\n\n[ ((a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * ( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) ] = 900(a -x)^2.\n\nLet me denote U = (a -x)^2.\n\nThen, equation (2) becomes:\n\n( U + (24 - y)^2 )*( U + y\u00b2 ) = 900 U.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nU^2 + U y\u00b2 + U (24 - y)^2 + y\u00b2 (24 - y)^2.\n\nWait, but expanding might not help. Alternatively, perhaps set U = (a -x)^2, then equation (2) is:\n\n(U + (24 - y)^2)(U + y\u00b2) = 900 U.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nLet me denote V = (24 - y)^2,\n\nand W = y\u00b2,\n\nso equation becomes (U + V)(U + W) = 900 U.\n\nExpanding left side:\n\nU\u00b2 + U(V + W) + V W = 900 U.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nU\u00b2 + U(V + W) + V W -900 U =0,\n\nU\u00b2 + U(V + W -900) + V W =0.\n\nHmm, quadratic in U. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express U in terms of a and x. Since U = (a -x)^2, and from equation (3), a = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)/x = S/x. Wait, since S = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, a -x = (S/x) -x = (S -x\u00b2)/x = y\u00b2/x.\n\nThus U = (a -x)^2 = (y\u00b2/x)^2.\n\nTherefore, U = y^4/x\u00b2.\n\nAlso, V = (24 - y)^2,\n\nW = y\u00b2.\n\nThus, substituting into equation (2):\n\n( U + V )( U + W ) = 900 U,\n\nso,\n\n( (y^4/x\u00b2) + (24 - y)^2 ) * ( (y^4/x\u00b2) + y\u00b2 ) = 900*(y^4/x\u00b2).\n\nHmm, this is similar to what I had before. Let me see if I can write this as:\n\nLet me set z = y/x. Then y = z x,\n\nso y^4/x^4 = z^4 x^4 /x^4 = z^4,\n\nWait, but maybe set z = y/x as before, then:\n\nLet me let z = y/x \u21d2 y = z x,\n\nso,\n\nU = y^4 /x\u00b2 = z^4 x^4 /x\u00b2 = z^4 x\u00b2,\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait U = (y^2 /x)^2 = ( (z x)^2 /x )^2 = ( z\u00b2 x )\u00b2 = z^4 x\u00b2. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, U = (a -x)^2 = (y\u00b2/x)^2 = ( (y/x)^2 ) * y\u00b2/x? Wait, no. Wait, (a -x) = y\u00b2/x,\n\nso U = (y\u00b2/x)^2 = y^4 /x\u00b2,\n\nBut with y = z x,\n\nthen y = z x \u21d2 y\u00b2 = z\u00b2 x\u00b2 \u21d2 y^4/x\u00b2 = z^4 x^4 /x\u00b2 = z^4 x\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, U = z^4 x\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, V = (24 - y)^2 = (24 - z x)^2,\n\nand W = y\u00b2 = z\u00b2 x\u00b2.\n\nThus, equation (2):\n\n( U + V )*( U + W ) = 900 U,\n\nSubstituting:\n\n( z^4 x\u00b2 + (24 - z x)^2 ) * ( z^4 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 x\u00b2 ) = 900 * z^4 x\u00b2.\n\nLet me factor out x\u00b2 from each term where possible.\n\nFirst term inside first bracket:\n\nz^4 x\u00b2 + (24 - z x)^2,\n\nSecond term inside second bracket:\n\nz^4 x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 x\u00b2 = x\u00b2(z^4 + z\u00b2).\n\nThus, the left-hand side becomes:\n\n[ z^4 x\u00b2 + (24 - z x)^2 ] * x\u00b2(z^4 + z\u00b2).\n\nThe right-hand side is 900 z^4 x\u00b2.\n\nSo divide both sides by x\u00b2 (assuming x \u22600):\n\n[ z^4 x\u00b2 + (24 - z x)^2 ] * (z^4 + z\u00b2) = 900 z^4.\n\nHmm, still complicated, but perhaps if I let\u2019s set t = z x, then t = y, but perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe set another substitution here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find a relation between equations (1) and (2) using the same substitution z = y/x.\n\nLet me recall equation (1):\n\nAfter substitution y = z x and a = x(1 + z\u00b2),\n\nequation (1) became:\n\n(1 + z\u00b2)[ (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x + 576 ] = 676.\n\nLet me note that (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 is part of that equation. Let me denote that term as K.\n\nLet me see if I can express equation (1):\n\n(1 + z\u00b2)(K) = 676,\n\nwhere K = (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576.\n\nHmm. Let me try to see if there is a way to combine equations (1) and (2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider that in equation (1) and (2), both involve terms like (24 - y)^2, which is (24 - z x)^2, and other terms with x and z.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think numerically. Let me see if I can find a relationship between equations (1) and (2).\n\nWait, in equation (1):\n\nOriginally, after substitution:\n\n(1 + z\u00b2)*( (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ) = 676,\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n(1 + z\u00b2)*( (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 )\n\nFirst, multiply (1 + z\u00b2) with each term inside:\n\n= (1 + z\u00b2)^2 x\u00b2 -48 z (1 + z\u00b2)x +576(1 + z\u00b2).\n\nSet equal to 676.\n\nEquation (1):\n\n(1 + z\u00b2)^2 x\u00b2 -48 z (1 + z\u00b2)x +576(1 + z\u00b2) -676 =0.\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in x, but with coefficients involving z. Not sure.\n\nSimilarly, equation (2) after substitution:\n\n[ z^4 x\u00b2 + (24 - z x)^2 ] * (z^4 + z\u00b2) = 900 z^4.\n\nLet me expand the first bracket:\n\nz^4 x\u00b2 + (24 - z x)^2 = z^4 x\u00b2 + 576 - 48 z x + z\u00b2 x\u00b2.\n\nThus, the first bracket becomes (z^4 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x + 576.\n\nTherefore, equation (2):\n\n[ (z^4 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x + 576 ] * (z^4 + z\u00b2) = 900 z^4.\n\nWait a second! Notice that the first bracket in equation (2) is exactly the same as the term K in equation (1). From equation (1):\n\nK = (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576,\n\nBut in equation (2), the first bracket is (z^4 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576.\n\nHmm, almost similar but with coefficients z^4 + z^2 instead of (1 + z\u00b2)^2? Wait, actually:\n\nWait, z^4 + z\u00b2 = z\u00b2(z\u00b2 +1),\n\nwhereas (1 + z\u00b2)^2 = 1 + 2 z\u00b2 + z^4.\n\nSo they are different. Hmm. However, maybe equation (1) can be written in terms of K.\n\nWait, equation (1):\n\n(1 + z\u00b2)*K = 676,\n\nso K = 676/(1 + z\u00b2).\n\nBut in equation (2):\n\nThe left side is [ (z^4 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ]*(z^4 + z\u00b2) = [ (z^2(z\u00b2 +1))x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ]*(z^2(z\u00b2 +1)).\n\nWait, but note that z^4 + z\u00b2 = z\u00b2(z\u00b2 +1). Let me denote that as M = z\u00b2(z\u00b2 +1).\n\nThen the first bracket in equation (2) is M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576,\n\nand equation (2) becomes:\n\n(M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576) * M = 900 z^4,\n\nHmm, but in equation (1):\n\nK = (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 = [ (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ] = ?\n\nWait, in equation (2), the first bracket is:\n\n(z^4 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 = z\u00b2(z\u00b2 +1)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 = M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576,\n\nwhere M = z\u00b2(z\u00b2 +1).\n\nTherefore, equation (2) is:\n\n(M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576) * M = 900 z^4,\n\nand equation (1) had:\n\n(1 + z\u00b2)*K =676,\n\nwhere K is (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576,\n\nso K = (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576,\n\nso (1 + z\u00b2)*K = (1 + z\u00b2)[ (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ] =676,\n\nBut in equation (2):\n\nLeft side is (M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576)*M,\n\nwhere M = z\u00b2(z\u00b2 +1).\n\nHmm, perhaps we can relate these equations. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote equation (1) as:\n\n(1 + z\u00b2)*K = 676,\n\nso K = 676/(1 + z\u00b2).\n\nThen, in equation (2):\n\nThe left side is (M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576)*M,\n\nbut M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 is equal to (M - z^4)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that M = z\u00b2(z\u00b2 +1),\n\nso M = z\u00b2*(1 + z\u00b2),\n\nso M = z\u00b2*(1 + z\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, equation (2):\n\n[ M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ] * M = 900 z^4,\n\nBut substituting M = z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2),\n\nthen equation (2):\n\n[ z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ] * z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2) = 900 z^4.\n\nHmm, let me see if we can express [ z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ] as something from equation (1).\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nK = (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 = 676/(1 + z\u00b2).\n\nWait, so (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 = 676/(1 + z\u00b2).\n\nMultiply both sides by z\u00b2:\n\nz\u00b2*(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z^3 x +576 z\u00b2 = 676 z\u00b2/(1 + z\u00b2).\n\nHmm, but the first term in equation (2)'s bracket is z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2, which is exactly the first term here. The second term is -48 z x, but here it's -48 z^3 x. Not matching. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider equation (2) in terms of K.\n\nWait, equation (2):\n\nLet me write the bracket in equation (2):\n\nM x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 = z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576.\n\nCompare with K from equation (1):\n\nK = (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576,\n\nSo, M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 = z\u00b2 * ( (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ) + something?\n\nWait:\n\nz\u00b2*( (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ) = z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z^3 x +576 z\u00b2,\n\nBut the expression M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 is z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576,\n\nThus, the difference between them is:\n\n[ z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ] - z\u00b2*(K) =\n\n[ z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ] - z\u00b2*( (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 )\n\n= z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 - z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 +48 z^3 x -576 z\u00b2\n\n= (-48 z x +48 z^3 x) + (576 -576 z\u00b2)\n\n= 48 z x (-1 + z\u00b2) +576(1 - z\u00b2)\n\n= (48 z x -576)(1 - z\u00b2) ?\n\nWait, let me factor:\n\n= 48 z x (z\u00b2 -1) +576(1 - z\u00b2)\n\n= (z\u00b2 -1)(48 z x -576 )\n\nHmm, this seems complicated but maybe useful?\n\nAlternatively, let me express equation (2):\n\nLeft side: [M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ] * M,\n\nwhere M = z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2),\n\nand equation (2) equals 900 z^4.\n\nLet me plug in the expression for K into this.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nK = (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 = 676/(1 + z\u00b2).\n\nSo (1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 = (676/(1 + z\u00b2)) +48 z x -576.\n\nWait, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write equation (2) as:\n\n[ M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ] * M = 900 z^4,\n\nBut M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 = M x\u00b2 -48 z x +576,\n\nand M = z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2),\n\nso:\n\nLeft side = [ z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 ] * z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2).\n\nLet me denote N = z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576,\n\nThen equation (2): N * z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2) = 900 z^4,\n\nThus, N = 900 z^4 / [ z\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2) ] = 900 z\u00b2 / (1 + z\u00b2).\n\nTherefore,\n\nz\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 = 900 z\u00b2/(1 + z\u00b2).\n\nHmm, so:\n\nz\u00b2(1 + z\u00b2)x\u00b2 -48 z x +576 - 900 z\u00b2/(1 + z\u00b2) =0.\n\nThis is getting too messy. Maybe there is a smarter substitution or a different approach.\n\nWait, let me recall that in triangle AX D, we had the area as 12x, and the sides. The circumradius is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394). For triangle AX D, that gave us an equation, but maybe there's another formula for the circumradius in terms of sides and angles? For an acute triangle, the circumradius can also be expressed as a/(2 sin A), but since we don't know the angles, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinate geometry for the circumradius. The circumradius of a triangle with coordinates can be calculated via the formula involving coordinates, but that might be even more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that in triangle AX D, since it's acute, all its angles are less than 90\u00b0, so the circumradius is still given by the standard formula. Hmm.\n\nWait, but perhaps there is a better approach using coordinate system and the given right angle at X.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so point X lies on the circle with diameter AB. Wait a second! Because in a rectangle, AB is a side, so if angle AXB is 90\u00b0, then X must lie on the circle whose diameter is AB. Wait, yes! That's a key insight.\n\nBecause in a circle with diameter AB, any point on the circle will form a right angle with A and B. Since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, X must lie on this circle.\n\nTherefore, the locus of X is the circle with diameter AB. Since X is inside the rectangle, this circle is entirely within the rectangle? Wait, but AB is horizontal from (0,0) to (a,0), so the circle would have center at (a/2,0) and radius a/2. But the rectangle has height 24, so the top of the circle is at y=0 + a/2, but since the rectangle's height is 24, unless a is at least 24, the circle might not reach up to the top. Wait, but X is inside the rectangle, so coordinates of X must be within 0 <x <a and 0 < y <24. Since the circle has center at (a/2,0) and radius a/2, so the highest point on the circle is at (a/2, a/2). To have this inside the rectangle, we need a/2 <24 \u21d2 a <48, but not sure if necessary here.\n\nTherefore, point X lies on the circle with diameter AB. Therefore, the coordinates of X satisfy (x - a/2)^2 + y^2 = (a/2)^2 \u21d2 x\u00b2 -a x + y\u00b2 =0, which is exactly equation (3). So that checks out.\n\nTherefore, this gives us that X is on this circle. Maybe this geometric insight can help.\n\nNow, given that triangles AX D and B XC have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively. Since both triangles are acute, their circumradii are related to their sides.\n\nPerhaps instead of working with coordinates, I can consider some properties.\n\nAlternatively, note that in a triangle, the circumradius R = abc/(4\u0394). For triangle AX D, which has sides AX, XD, and AD. We can write the sides in terms of coordinates, but maybe we can find expressions for AX, XD, etc., in terms of a and the coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinate system with AB as x-axis, and since X is on the circle with diameter AB, so coordinates of X satisfy x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x (from equation (3)). Wait, equation (3) is x\u00b2 -a x + y\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x. So, that's the equation of the circle.\n\nTherefore, we can parametrize point X using the circle equation. Let me set x = a cos\u00b2\u03b8 and y = (a/2) sin 2\u03b8 or something like that. Wait, maybe parametrize using an angle.\n\nLet me parametrize the circle with diameter AB. Let me consider angle \u03b8 such that point X is at an angle \u03b8 from the x-axis. Wait, since the circle has center at (a/2,0) and radius a/2, parametrizing with an angle \u03c6 from the center.\n\nLet me consider coordinates relative to the center. The center is (a/2,0). Let me denote the angle from the positive x-axis (relative to center) as \u03c6. Then coordinates relative to center are ( (a/2) cos \u03c6, (a/2) sin \u03c6 ). Therefore, absolute coordinates are:\n\nx = a/2 + (a/2) cos \u03c6,\n\ny = 0 + (a/2) sin \u03c6.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = (a/2)(1 + cos \u03c6),\n\ny = (a/2) sin \u03c6.\n\nThat's a standard parametrization of the circle with diameter AB.\n\nThis might be helpful. Let me use this parametrization.\n\nLet me set:\n\nx = (a/2)(1 + cos \u03c6),\n\ny = (a/2) sin \u03c6,\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the angle parameter, varying from 0 to 2\u03c0. Since X is inside the rectangle, y must be between 0 and24, so (a/2) sin \u03c6 <24. Also x must be between 0 and a, which it is since cos \u03c6 ranges from -1 to 1, so 1 + cos \u03c6 ranges from 0 to 2, so x is between 0 and a.\n\nNow, with this parametrization, I can express coordinates x and y in terms of a and \u03c6. Then plug into the equations for the circumradii of the triangles AX D and B XC.\n\nLet me first compute the sides of triangle AX D.\n\nTriangle AX D has vertices at A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24).\n\nSides:\n\nAX: distance from A to X: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nBut from the circle equation, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x. So AX = sqrt(a x).\n\nXD: distance from X to D(0,24):\n\nsqrt( (x -0)^2 + (y -24)^2 ) = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 ).\n\nAD: distance from A to D is 24, which is fixed.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle B XC:\n\nB is (a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24). So:\n\nBX: sqrt( (x -a)^2 + y\u00b2 ).\n\nXC: sqrt( (x -a)^2 + (y -24)^2 ).\n\nBC:24.\n\nNow, let me compute the circumradius for triangle AX D first.\n\nUsing the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394), where a, b, c are sides and \u0394 the area.\n\nLet me compute the sides:\n\nAX = sqrt(a x),\n\nXD: sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 ),\n\nAD =24.\n\nThe area \u0394 of AX D is 12x, as computed earlier.\n\nSo the circumradius R1 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4\u0394).\n\nPlugging in:\n\nR1 = ( sqrt(a x) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 ) *24 ) / (4*12x).\n\nSimplify denominator: 48x.\n\nNumerator: 24 * sqrt(a x) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 ).\n\nThus,\n\nR1 = [24 * sqrt(a x) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 ) ] / 48x\n\n= [ sqrt(a x) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 ) ] / (2x )\n\nThis is the same expression as before, which we set equal to 13.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\nThe sides are BX, XC, BC=24.\n\nBX = sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ),\n\nXC = sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ),\n\nBC =24.\n\nArea is 12(a -x).\n\nThus, R2 = (BX * XC * BC)/(4 * area).\n\nSo,\n\nR2 = ( sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) *24 ) / (4*12(a -x) )\n\nSimplify denominator: 48(a -x).\n\nNumerator: 24 * sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nThus,\n\nR2 = [24 * sqrt(...) * sqrt(...) ] / (48(a -x) )\n\n= [ sqrt(...) * sqrt(...) ] / (2(a -x) )\n\nSet equal to 15.\n\nSo, with this parametrization, maybe substituting x and y in terms of a and \u03c6.\n\nLet me proceed with that.\n\nFirst, express x and y in terms of a and \u03c6:\n\nx = (a/2)(1 + cos \u03c6),\n\ny = (a/2) sin \u03c6.\n\nTherefore,\n\nFirst compute AX:\n\nAX = sqrt(a x) = sqrt(a*(a/2)(1 + cos \u03c6)) = sqrt( (a\u00b2/2)(1 + cos \u03c6) ) = (a/\u221a2) sqrt(1 + cos \u03c6).\n\nHmm, but maybe keeping in terms of a and \u03c6.\n\nCompute XD:\n\nXD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 ).\n\nLet me compute x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = (a\u00b2/4)(1 + cos \u03c6)^2,\n\n(y -24)^2 = ( (a/2 sin \u03c6) -24 )^2 = (a/2 sin \u03c6 -24)^2.\n\nThus,\n\nXD squared is x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 =\n\n(a\u00b2/4)(1 + cos \u03c6)^2 + (a/2 sin \u03c6 -24)^2.\n\nSimilarly, need to compute this expression.\n\nThis might get messy, but let's try.\n\nFirst term: (a\u00b2/4)(1 + cos \u03c6)^2,\n\nSecond term: (a/2 sin \u03c6 -24)^2 = (a sin \u03c6 /2 -24)^2 = ( -24 + (a/2) sin \u03c6 )\u00b2 = 24\u00b2 -24*(a sin \u03c6) + (a\u00b2/4) sin\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nTherefore, adding the two terms:\n\nTotal XD squared:\n\n(a\u00b2/4)(1 + 2 cos \u03c6 + cos\u00b2 \u03c6) + 576 -24 a sin \u03c6 + (a\u00b2/4) sin\u00b2 \u03c6.\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\nThe a\u00b2/4 terms:\n\n(a\u00b2/4)[ (1 + 2 cos \u03c6 + cos\u00b2 \u03c6) + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 ]\n\n= (a\u00b2/4)[ 1 + 2 cos \u03c6 + (cos\u00b2 \u03c6 + sin\u00b2 \u03c6) ]\n\n= (a\u00b2/4)[1 + 2 cos \u03c6 +1 ]\n\n= (a\u00b2/4)(2 + 2 cos \u03c6 )\n\n= (a\u00b2/4)*2*(1 + cos \u03c6 )\n\n= (a\u00b2/2)(1 + cos \u03c6).\n\nThe remaining terms from the second part:\n\n576 -24 a sin \u03c6.\n\nThus,\n\nXD squared = (a\u00b2/2)(1 + cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6.\n\nTherefore,\n\nXD = sqrt( (a\u00b2/2)(1 + cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 ).\n\nHmm, this is still complicated, but maybe manageable.\n\nNow, compute the product AX * XD:\n\nAX = sqrt(a x) = sqrt( a*(a/2)(1 + cos \u03c6) ) = sqrt( a\u00b2/2 (1 + cos \u03c6) ) = (a /\u221a2) sqrt(1 + cos \u03c6).\n\nThus,\n\nAX * XD = (a /\u221a2) sqrt(1 + cos \u03c6) * sqrt( (a\u00b2/2)(1 + cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 ).\n\nThis is getting very involved.

Wait, actually, XC squared = (a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6.\n\nWait, interestingly, the expression for XC squared is similar to XD squared but with cos \u03c6 replaced with something else?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nPreviously, XD squared was:\n\n(a\u00b2/2)(1 + cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6.\n\nSo the difference between XD squared and XC squared is the sign of cos \u03c6.\n\nSo, XD squared = (a\u00b2/2)(1 + cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6,\n\nXC squared = (a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6.\n\nTherefore, their product XD squared * XC squared = [ (a\u00b2/2)^2 (1 + cos \u03c6)(1 - cos \u03c6) + ... ] + ... Hmm, not sure.\n\nBut we have from triangle AX D that XD squared = 676x/a = 338(1 + cos \u03c6),\n\nand from triangle BXC, we have BX * XC =30(a -x).\n\nSince:\n\nBX = (a /\u221a2) sqrt(1 - cos \u03c6),\n\nXC = sqrt( XC squared ) = sqrt( (a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 ).\n\nHmm, but this seems too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the expressions for BX and XC in terms of a and \u03c6.\n\nBX = (a /\u221a2) sqrt(1 - cos \u03c6),\n\nXC = sqrt( (a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 ).\n\nThus, BX * XC = (a /\u221a2) sqrt(1 - cos \u03c6) * sqrt( (a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 ).\n\nSet this equal to 30(a -x):\n\na -x = a - (a/2)(1 + cos \u03c6 ) = (a/2)(1 - cos \u03c6).\n\nThus,\n\nBX * XC = 30*(a/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) =15 a (1 - cos \u03c6 ).\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a /\u221a2) sqrt(1 - cos \u03c6 ) * sqrt( (a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 ) =15 a (1 - cos \u03c6 ).\n\nDivide both sides by a:\n\n(1/\u221a2) sqrt(1 - cos \u03c6 ) * sqrt( (a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 ) =15 (1 - cos \u03c6 ).\n\nMultiply both sides by \u221a2:\n\nsqrt(1 - cos \u03c6 ) * sqrt( (a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 ) =15 \u221a2 (1 - cos \u03c6 ).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(1 - cos \u03c6 ) [ (a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 ] = (15 \u221a2 )\u00b2 (1 - cos \u03c6 )\u00b2.\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: (1 - cos \u03c6 ) [ (a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 ]\n\nRight side: 450 (1 - cos \u03c6 )\u00b2.\n\nCancel (1 - cos \u03c6 ) from both sides (assuming cos \u03c6 \u22601, which would mean \u03c6=0, but then X would be at (a,0), but angle AXB would be 180\u00b0, not 90\u00b0, so that's invalid):\n\nLeft side becomes: (a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6,\n\nRight side:450 (1 - cos \u03c6 ).\n\nThus,\n\n(a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =450(1 - cos \u03c6 ).\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n(a\u00b2/2)(1 - cos \u03c6 ) -450(1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nFactor out (1 - cos \u03c6 ):\n\n[ a\u00b2/2 -450 ](1 - cos \u03c6 ) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0.\n\nHmm, now we have two equations from AX D and B XC:\n\nFrom AX D:\n\n[ (a\u00b2/2 -338) ](1 + cos \u03c6) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0.

Let me use either Equation A or B.\n\nLet me pick Equation B:\n\n(C -450)(1 - cos \u03c6) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nAgain with C =a\u00b2/2,\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 - cos \u03c6) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0.\n\nLet me also note that from Equation C, we can express cos \u03c6 in terms of a, so cos \u03c6 = -112/(a\u00b2 -788).\n\nBut we still need to express sin \u03c6 in terms of a. Let me use the identity sin\u00b2 \u03c6 + cos\u00b2 \u03c6 =1,\n\nso sin \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6 ), but since \u03c6 is an angle in the rectangle (0 < y <24, so sin \u03c6 must be positive, as y = (a/2) sin \u03c6, so sin \u03c6 positive. So sin \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - cos\u00b2 \u03c6).\n\nLet me denote cos \u03c6 = K = -112/(a\u00b2 -788).\n\nThus,\n\nsin \u03c6 = sqrt(1 - K\u00b2) = sqrt(1 - (12544)/(a\u00b2 -788)^2 ).\n\nThis seems complicated, but let me proceed.\n\nLet me substitute cos \u03c6 = K into Equation B:\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 - K) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n[ (a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 - K) +576 ] -24 a sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nTherefore,\n\n24 a sin \u03c6 = (a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 - K) +576,\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\nFirst compute (a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 - K):\n\nLet me plug K = -112/(a\u00b2 -788):\n\n1 - K = 1 + 112/(a\u00b2 -788) = (a\u00b2 -788 +112)/(a\u00b2 -788) = (a\u00b2 -676)/(a\u00b2 -788).\n\nThus,\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -450) * (a\u00b2 -676)/(a\u00b2 -788) +576.\n\nThis is getting very involved. Let me see if there is another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express sin \u03c6 from Equation C and substitute into Equation A or B.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that we have two equations involving a and \u03c6, and we've eliminated \u03c6 somewhat. The equations are:\n\nEquation C: cos \u03c6 = -112/(a\u00b2 -788),\n\nEquation A: (a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 + cos \u03c6) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nLet me use Equation C to substitute cos \u03c6 into Equation A:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write Equation A:\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 + cos \u03c6) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0.\n\nSubstitute cos \u03c6 = K = -112/(a\u00b2 -788),\n\nthen,\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 + K) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nCompute 1 + K =1 + (-112)/(a\u00b2 -788) = (a\u00b2 -788 -112)/ (a\u00b2 -788) )= (a\u00b2 - 900)/(a\u00b2 -788).\n\nThus,\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)*(a\u00b2 -900)/(a\u00b2 -788) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nLet me compute the first term:\n\nLet me denote numerator terms:\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)*(a\u00b2 -900) = [ (a\u00b2 - 676)/2 ]*(a\u00b2 -900),\n\nWait,\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338) = (a\u00b2 - 676)/2,\n\nYes, since 338*2=676.\n\nThus,\n\n(a\u00b2 -676)/2 * (a\u00b2 -900) / (a\u00b2 -788).\n\nSo,\n\nFirst term:\n\n[ (a\u00b2 -676)(a\u00b2 -900) ] / [2(a\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nTherefore,\n\nEquation A becomes:\n\n[ (a\u00b2 -676)(a\u00b2 -900) ] / [2(a\u00b2 -788) ] +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nRearranged,\n\n24 a sin \u03c6 = [ (a\u00b2 -676)(a\u00b2 -900) ] / [2(a\u00b2 -788) ] +576.\n\nThis is still very complex.\n\nPerhaps I need to find a value of a that makes the equations consistent. Maybe assume a is an integer? Since the circumradii are 13 and 15, which are integers, perhaps the sides are integers as well? Maybe the rectangle has integer sides?\n\nGiven BC =24 is given, which is integer. Maybe AB is also an integer. Let me assume that a is an integer, and try to find possible a.\n\nLet me see if I can find a value for a such that the equations hold.\n\nFirst, from Equation C:\n\ncos \u03c6 = -112/(a\u00b2 -788).\n\nSince cos \u03c6 must be between -1 and 1,\n\nso,\n\n-1 \u2264 -112/(a\u00b2 -788) \u22641.\n\nLet me solve the inequalities:\n\nFirst, -112/(a\u00b2 -788) \u22641,\n\nMultiply both sides by (a\u00b2 -788). But the sign of denominator matters.\n\nCase 1: a\u00b2 -788 >0 \u21d2 a\u00b2 >788.\n\nThen the inequality becomes:\n\n-112 \u2264 (a\u00b2 -788)*1,\n\nWhich is always true since a\u00b2 -788 >0 \u21d2 (a\u00b2 -788)*1>0 >-112.\n\nSecond inequality:\n\n-112/(a\u00b2 -788) \u2265-1,\n\nMultiply both sides by (a\u00b2 -788) (positive):\n\n-112 \u2265 - (a\u00b2 -788),\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):\n\n112 \u2264 a\u00b2 -788,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 \u2265 788 +112 =900,\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 \u2265900 \u21d2 a\u226530 (since a is positive).\n\nCase 2: a\u00b2 -788 <0,\n\nthen denominator is negative,\n\nso:\n\n-112/(a\u00b2 -788) \u22641,\n\nMultiply both sides by (a\u00b2 -788) (negative \u21d2 reverse inequality):\n\n-112 \u2265 a\u00b2 -788,\n\n\u21d2 a\u00b2 -788 \u2264-112,\n\n\u21d2 a\u00b2 \u2264788 -112 =676,\n\n\u21d2 a \u226426.\n\nBut also,\n\ncos \u03c6 must be \u2265-1,\n\nso,\n\n-112/(a\u00b2 -788) \u2265-1,\n\nMultiply by (a\u00b2 -788) (negative \u21d2 reverse inequality):\n\n-112 \u2264 (a\u00b2 -788),\n\n\u21d2 a\u00b2 -788 \u2265-112,\n\n\u21d2a\u00b2 \u2265788 -112 =676,\n\nThus,\n\nif a\u00b2 -788 <0,\n\nthen 676 \u2264a\u00b2 <788,\n\n\u21d226 \u2264a <sqrt(788)\u224828.07.\n\nSo possible a between 26 and 28.07, but since a must be integer (assuming), a=26,27,28.\n\nBut in this case, cos \u03c6 = -112/(a\u00b2 -788),\n\nfor a\u00b2 <788,\n\nfor example a=26,\n\nthen a\u00b2=676,\n\ncos \u03c6 = -112/(676 -788)= -112/(-112)=1,\n\nso cos \u03c6=1 \u21d2 \u03c6=0,\n\nbut then point X would be ( (a/2)(1+1), 0 ) \u21d2 (a,0), but that's point B, which is on the edge, but the problem states X is inside, so \u03c6=0 is invalid.\n\nSimilarly, a=27,\n\na\u00b2=729,\n\ncos \u03c6= -112/(729-788)= -112/(-59)=112/59\u22481.898>1, which is invalid.\n\nThus, no solution in this case.\n\nThus, only possible case is a\u00b2 \u2265900 \u21d2 a\u226530.\n\nSo a must be at least 30.\n\nNow, let me try integer a values starting from 30 upwards.\n\nLet me try a=25?

Maybe trying another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set t =a\u00b2.\n\nLet me let t =a\u00b2,\n\nthen Equation C:\n\ncos \u03c6= -112/(t -788).\n\nThen in Equation A and B, we can write in terms of t.\n\nLet me try to combine Equation A and B.\n\nWe have from Equation C:\n\ncos \u03c6 = -112/(t -788),\n\nand from Equation A and B, after substituting cos \u03c6,\n\nwe can perhaps find an equation in terms of t.\n\nAlternatively, let's take Equation A and Equation B and write them in terms of t and sin \u03c6, then combine.\n\nLet me use Equation A:\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 + cos \u03c6) +576 -24 a sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nwith a\u00b2 =t,\n\nso,\n\n(t/2 -338)(1 + cos \u03c6) +576 -24 sqrt(t) sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nSimilarly, Equation B:\n\n(t/2 -450)(1 -

(t/2 -450)(1 - cos \u03c6)=0,\n\nWhich is the same as earlier.\n\nPreviously, this led to (t -788) cos \u03c6 = -112,\n\nwhich is Equation C.\n\nThus, need another relation.\n\nLet me consider that in Equation A and Equation B, both have terms like:\n\nterm +576 -24a sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nThus,\n\nFrom Equation A:\n\n24a sin \u03c6 = (t/2 -338)(1 + cos \u03c6) +576,\n\nFrom Equation B:\n\n24a sin \u03c6 = (t/2 -450)(1 - cos \u03c6) +576,\n\nThus, equate the two expressions for 24a sin \u03c6:\n\n(t/2 -338)(1 + cos \u03c6) +576 = (t/2 -450)(1 - cos \u03c6) +576,\n\nCancel 576:\n\n(t/2 -338)(1 + cos \u03c6) = (t/2 -450)(1 -

(t/2)(1 - cos \u03c6) +450(1 - cos \u03c6) =0,\n\nThis is the same as before, leading to Equation C.\n\nTherefore, to proceed further, we need to use the relation between sin \u03c6 and cos \u03c6.\n\nLet me consider that from Equation C, cos \u03c6= -112/(t -788),\n\nthen sin \u03c6= sqrt(1 - (12544)/(t -788)^2 ).\n\nLet me substitute into Equation A.\n\nLet me write Equation A again:\n\n(t/2 -338)(1 + cos \u03c6) +576 -24 sqrt(t) sin \u03c6 =0,\n\nSubstitute cos \u03c6 and sin \u03c6:\n\nFirst compute 1 + cos \u03c6 =1 + [ -112/(t -788) ] = (t -788 -112)/(t -788)= (t -900)/(t -788),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nsin \u03c6 = sqrt(1 -

(ka)^2 =k a\u00b2 -k\u00b2 a\u00b2 =k a\u00b2(1 -k).\n\nThus,\n\ny\u00b2 =k a\u00b2(1 -k),\n\nAlso, y=12 -k*(676/a\u00b2 -1),\n\nThus,\n\ny=12 -k*( (676 -a\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ),\n\nLet me write this as:\n\ny=12 - (k(676 -a\u00b2))/a\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\ny\u00b2= [12 - (k(676 -a\u00b2))/a\u00b2]^2 =k a\u00b2(1 -k),\n\nThis equation in terms of a and k.\n\nThis substitution might help, but it's still very involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that a is such that 676/a -a is an integer or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider that the problem requires an answer of 39, given the proximity in the trial.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the problem might have a nice answer where a\u00b2 -788 divides 112,\n\nFrom Equation C:\n\ncos \u03c6 = -112/(t -788),\n\nwhere t=a\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 -788 must divide 112,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 -788 divides 112,\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2 -788 is a positive divisor of 112,\n\nsince a\u00b2>788,\n\nPossible positive divisors of 112 are 1,2,4,7,8,14,16,28,56,112,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2=788 +d,\n\nwhere d is a divisor of 112,\n\npossible a\u00b2:\n\n789, 790, 792, 795, 796, 800, 804, 816, 844, 900.\n\nThen a must be sqrt of these,\n\nCheck which of these are perfect squares:\n\n789: not,\n\n790: no,\n\n792: no,\n\n795: no,\n\n796: no,\n\n800: sqrt(800)=28.28,\n\n804: no,\n\n816: no,\n\n844: no,\n\n900: yes, sqrt(900)=30.\n\nThus,\n\nonly a\u00b2=900 \u21d2 a=30,\n\nBut when a=30,\n\ncos \u03c6= -112/(900-788)= -112/112=-1,\n\nwhich gives \u03c6=\u03c0,\n\nthen y= (30/2) sin \u03c0=0,\n\nso X is at (0,0) which is point A, not inside the rectangle.\n\nThus invalid.\n\nThus, there is no solution with a\u00b2 -788 dividing 112,\n\nTherefore, my assumption that a is integer might be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires a different approach.\n\nLet me think differently.\n\nLet me consider coordinates again.\n\nLet me assume that the rectangle has AB =a, BC=24.\n\nPoint X is inside with coordinates (x,y).\n\nGiven angle AXB is 90\u00b0,\n\nso x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -a x =0.\n\nTriangles AX D and B XC are acute with circumradii 13 and 15.\n\nLet me consider the circumradius formulas for the triangles.\n\nFor triangle A X D:\n\nThe sides are AX= sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt(a x),\n\nXD= sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2),\n\nAD=24,\n\nArea=12x,\n\nCircumradius R1=13,\n\nThus,\n\nR1= (AX * XD * AD)/(4*Area)= (sqrt(a x) * XD *24)/(48x)= (sqrt(a x)* XD)/(2x)=13,\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(a x)* XD=26x,\n\n=> XD=26x/sqrt(a x)=26 sqrt(x/a),\n\nThus,\n\nXD squared= 26\u00b2*(x/a),\n\nBut XD squared is x\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2 =676x/a,\n\nSimilarly, from angle AXB,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x,\n\nThus,\n\nsubtract the equations:\n\n[ x\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2 ] -

      "full_content": "Alright, let's tackle this geometry problem. Hmm, so we have a rectangle ABCD where BC is 24. There's a point X inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, and their circumradii are 13 and 15 respectively. We need to find the length of AB.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Since BC is 24, that means AD is also 24, right? Wait, actually, in rectangle ABCD, the sides AB and CD are one pair of opposite sides, and BC and AD are the other pair. So BC is 24, so AD must also be 24. The other sides, AB and CD, are the lengths we need to find, but the problem asks for AB, so that's the side we need to determine.\n\nNow, point X is inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. That seems important. So triangle AXB is a right-angled triangle at X. Also, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. Their circumradii are given as 13 and 15. Since the triangle is acute, the circumradius is half the length of the hypotenuse? Wait, no, the circumradius of a right-angled triangle is half the hypotenuse. But here, the triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, so they aren't right-angled. Therefore, their circumradius is given by the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides and A is the area. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this.\n\nLet me start by setting up a coordinate system. Let me place rectangle ABCD such that point A is at the origin (0,0), so then B would be at (AB, 0), C at (AB, 24), and D at (0,24). Then point X is somewhere inside the rectangle with coordinates (x,y), where 0 < x < AB and 0 < y < 24.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so vectors AX and BX are perpendicular. Let's express that. The vector AX is (x, y) and the vector BX is (x - AB, y). Their dot product should be zero:\n\nx*(x - AB) + y*y = 0\n=> x\u00b2 - AB*x + y\u00b2 = 0. (Equation 1)\n\nNext, triangles AXD and BXC have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively. Let's recall that the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394), where \u0394 is the area. Alternatively, for any triangle, R = (a)/(2*sin A) where A is the angle opposite side a. Maybe using coordinates, we can find the coordinates of X such that the circumradius conditions are satisfied.\n\nFirst, let's consider triangle AXD. The vertices of this triangle are A(0,0), X(x,y), and D(0,24). Let's compute the lengths of the sides of this triangle.\n\nSide AX: distance from A to X is \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nSide XD: distance from X to D is \u221a[(x - 0)^2 + (y - 24)^2] = \u221a[x\u00b2 + (y - 24)^2]\n\nSide AD: distance from A to D is 24 (since it's a side of the rectangle). Wait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, so that's fixed. Wait, but triangle AXD has sides AX, XD, and AD? Wait no, AD is part of the rectangle, but in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, actually, the triangle is A-X-D, so the sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, no, A to D is 24, but A to X is \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), X to D is \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2), and A to D is 24. So the sides are those three lengths.\n\nWait, but AD is 24, which is fixed, but in triangle AXD, AD is one of the sides. However, triangle AXD's sides are AX, XD, and AD. But AD is a side of the rectangle, so that's fixed. So the triangle has sides of length \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2), and 24.\n\nSimilarly, triangle BXC has vertices B(AB,0), X(x,y), and C(AB,24). The sides of triangle BXC are BX, XC, and BC (which is 24). Wait, the sides would be BX, XC, and BC. Wait, BC is 24. So sides are BX = \u221a[(AB - x)^2 + y\u00b2], XC = \u221a[(AB - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2], and BC = 24.\n\nSo for triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, AD (24). For triangle BXC, the sides are BX, XC, BC (24). The problem states both triangles are acute. Hmm, so all angles in those triangles are less than 90 degrees. Maybe that condition will help, but perhaps the circumradius is given, so maybe we can use the formula for circumradius.\n\nLet me recall that the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area. Alternatively, R can also be expressed using the formula R = a/(2*sin A) where A is the angle opposite side a. Since the triangles are acute, all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so their sines are less than 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinate geometry can be used here. Since the coordinates are set up with A at (0,0), etc., perhaps we can write equations for the circumradius of triangles AXD and BXC.\n\nStarting with triangle AXD. The three points are A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). Let me denote the sides as follows:\n\nLet me denote the sides:\n\nAX: length \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nXD: length \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)\n\nAD: 24\n\nThe circumradius R1 (for triangle AXD) is given as 13. Let's compute R1 using the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394). So first, let's compute the area \u0394 of triangle AXD.\n\nThe area can be calculated using coordinates. The coordinates are (0,0), (x,y), (0,24). The area is (base * height)/2. The base AD is along the y-axis from (0,0) to (0,24), so its length is 24, and the height is the horizontal distance from point X to the y-axis, which is x. Therefore, the area \u0394 = (24 * x)/2 = 12x.\n\nAlternatively, using determinant formula: \u00bd | (0*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - y)) | = \u00bd |0 + 24x + 0| = 12x. Yep, same result.\n\nSo, area is 12x. Then, the sides are a = AX = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), b = XD = \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2), c = AD =24.\n\nTherefore, the circumradius R1 = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394) = [\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) * 24 ] / (4 * 12x)\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12x = 48x\n\nNumerator: 24 * \u221a( (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) )\n\nTherefore,\n\nR1 = [24 / 48x] * \u221a[ (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ]\n\nSimplify 24/48x = 1/(2x)\n\nThus,\n\n13 = [1/(2x)] * \u221a[ (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2x:\n\n26x = \u221a[ (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(26x)^2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\nLet me denote term1 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2\n\nterm2 = x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = x\u00b2 + (24\u00b2 - 48y + y\u00b2) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 576 - 48y\n\nTherefore, term1 * term2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 576 - 48y )\n\nLet me denote S = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, then term1 = S, term2 = S + 576 -48y\n\nThus, term1 * term2 = S(S + 576 -48y ) = S\u00b2 + S(576 -48y )\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(26x)^2 = S\u00b2 + S(576 -48y )\n\nBut S = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, so substitute S:\n\nLeft side is 676x\u00b2\n\nRight side is (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)^2 + (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(576 -48y)\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider triangle AXD. Since it's a triangle with sides AX, XD, AD=24, and circumradius 13. Let me think of another formula for circumradius. The formula R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394). Since we already have the area as 12x, and sides as AX, XD, 24. Let me denote the sides as follows: let\u2019s say a = AX = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), b = XD = \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2), c = AD =24.\n\nThen:\n\nR1 = (a*b*c) / (4\u0394) = 13\n\nSo,\n\n(a*b*c) = 52\u0394 = 52*(12x) = 624x\n\nThus,\n\n\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) * 24 = 624x\n\nDivide both sides by 24:\n\n\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = 26x\n\nWhich brings us back to the same equation as before, so that didn't help much. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use coordinates to find the circumradius. The circumradius can also be found by the formula for the circumcircle of a triangle. The circumcircle of triangle AXD must have a radius of 13, so the circumradius is 13. Similarly for triangle BXC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the circumcircle equations?\n\nLet me try that. For triangle AXD with points A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). The circumradius is 13, so the circumcircle has radius 13. Let me find the circumcircle equation.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0. Let's plug in the three points.\n\nFor point A(0,0):\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F =0 => F=0.\n\nSo equation simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nPlug in point D(0,24):\n\n0 + 24\u00b2 + 0 + E*24 =0 => 576 +24E =0 => 24E = -576 => E= -24.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx -24y =0.\n\nNow plug in point X(x,y):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D*x -24*y =0. But since X is on the circle, so that equation holds. However, this might not help directly. Wait, but we can use the fact that the circumradius is 13.\n\nThe radius R is given by sqrt( (D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 - F ) /1, but since F=0 here, R = sqrt( (D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 )\n\nWait, let me recall the formula for radius:\n\nFor the circle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, the radius is sqrt( (D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 - F )\n\nSo here, since F=0, radius R = sqrt( (D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 )\n\nWe have R =13, so:\n\nsqrt( (D/2)^2 + (-24/2)^2 ) =13\n\nSimplify:\n\nsqrt( (D/2)^2 + 12\u00b2 ) =13\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(D/2)^2 + 144 = 169\n\n=> (D/2)^2 = 25\n\n=> D/2 = \u00b15\n\nThus, D = \u00b110\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u00b110x -24y =0.\n\nBut we also have that point X(x,y) lies on this circle, so plugging in X's coordinates:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u00b110x -24y =0.\n\nBut also, from the equation when we plugged in X into the circle equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x -24y =0, which gives the same condition.\n\nTherefore, the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x -24y =0, where D is either 10 or -10. Hmm, so two possibilities here.\n\nSo let's see. Since point X is inside the rectangle, coordinates x and y are between 0 and AB (for x) and 0 and 24 (for y). Let's see, the D can be either +10 or -10.\n\nIf D =10, then the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +10x -24y =0.\n\nIf D= -10, then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x -24y =0.\n\nWe need to figure out which one it is. Let me consider that the center of the circle is at (-D/2, -E/2). Since E is -24, so center is at (-D/2, 12).\n\nFor D=10, center is (-5, 12). Since the rectangle's width is AB, which is along the x-axis from 0 to AB. The point (-5,12) would be outside the rectangle (since x is negative), so that would not contain point X inside the rectangle. Therefore, D must be -10, so that the center is at (5,12). Since 5 is between 0 and AB (assuming AB is larger than 5, which seems reasonable), so this is plausible. So D=-10.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circumcircle of triangle AXD is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x -24y =0.\n\nSo, plugging in point X(x,y):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x -24y =0.\n\nBut also, we know from the right angle at X in triangle AXB that x\u00b2 - AB*x + y\u00b2=0 (from equation 1 above).\n\nLet me see if we can combine these equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = AB*x.\n\nSubstitute into the circle equation:\n\n(AB*x) -10x -24y =0\n\n=> x*(AB -10) -24y =0.\n\nSo equation (2): x*(AB -10) =24 y.\n\nSo that's one equation connecting x and y in terms of AB.\n\nNow, moving on to triangle BXC. Let's do the same approach.\n\nTriangle BXC has vertices at B(AB,0), X(x,y), and C(AB,24). The circumradius is 15.\n\nSimilarly, let's find the equation of the circumcircle for triangle BXC.\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nPoints B(AB,0), X(x,y), C(AB,24).\n\nLet me set up the general circle equation again. Let variables be x and y, but since the points are in terms of AB, we need to use variables accordingly.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = R^2, but perhaps using the general form again.\n\nLet me use the general form: Ax\u00b2 + By\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0? Wait, actually, let me use the standard form.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the same method as before.\n\nLet the equation be x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlugging in point B(AB, 0):\n\nAB\u00b2 + 0 + D*AB + E*0 + F =0 => AB\u00b2 + D AB + F =0. (Equation a)\n\nPoint C(AB,24):\n\nAB\u00b2 +24\u00b2 + D*AB + E*24 + F =0. (Equation b)\n\nPoint X(x,y):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x + E y + F =0. (Equation c)\n\nAlso, the radius R of this circle is 15. The radius can be calculated via the formula sqrt( (D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 - F ). So,\n\nsqrt( (D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 - F ) =15. (Equation d)\n\nLet me see if I can solve equations a, b, d to find D, E, F in terms of AB, and then relate to equation c and other conditions.\n\nFirst, subtract equation a from equation b:\n\n[AB\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 + D AB +24 E + F] - [AB\u00b2 + D AB + F] =0 -0.\n\nThis gives 24\u00b2 +24 E =0 => 576 +24E=0 => 24E = -576 => E = -24.\n\nSo E = -24, same as before.\n\nThen, equation a: AB\u00b2 + D AB + F =0 => F = -AB\u00b2 - D AB.\n\nEquation d: sqrt( (D/2)^2 + (E/2)^2 - F ) =15\n\nPlugging E =-24 and F = -AB\u00b2 - D AB,\n\nInside the sqrt:\n\n(D/2)^2 + (-24/2)^2 - (-AB\u00b2 - D AB) =\n\n(D\u00b2)/4 + (144) + AB\u00b2 + D AB\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt[ (D\u00b2)/4 + 144 + AB\u00b2 + D AB ) ] =15\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(D\u00b2)/4 + 144 + AB\u00b2 + D AB =225\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\nD\u00b2 + 576 + 4AB\u00b2 +4D AB = 900\n\nBring 900 to left:\n\nD\u00b2 + 4AB\u00b2 +4D AB +576 -900=0\n\nSimplify:\n\nD\u00b2 +4AB\u00b2 +4D AB -324 =0\n\nHmm, that's one equation with variables D and AB. Let's see if we can find another equation from the points.\n\nWe have equation c:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x + E y + F =0\n\nWe already know E = -24, and F = -AB\u00b2 - D AB.\n\nSo substituting into equation c:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + D x -24 y + (-AB\u00b2 - D AB) =0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx -24y -AB\u00b2 - D AB =0\n\nRearranged:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + D(x - AB) -24y - AB\u00b2 =0\n\nBut from equation 1 (from angle AXB being 90\u00b0), we have x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = AB x. Let's substitute that in:\n\nAB x + D(x - AB) -24y - AB\u00b2 =0\n\nExpand:\n\nABx + Dx - D AB -24y - AB\u00b2 =0\n\nGroup terms with D:\n\nD(x - AB) + ABx - D AB -24y - AB\u00b2 =0. Wait, perhaps better to rearrange:\n\nABx + Dx - D AB -24y - AB\u00b2 =0\n\nFactor terms with D:\n\nD(x - AB) + AB(x - AB) -24y =0 ?\n\nWait, let me reorganize:\n\nABx + Dx - D AB -24y - AB\u00b2 =0\n\nTake terms with AB:\n\nABx - AB\u00b2 - D AB = AB(x - AB - D)\n\nThen the remaining terms: Dx -24y\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nABx + Dx = x(AB + D)\n\nSimilarly, -D AB - AB\u00b2 = -AB(D + AB)\n\nThus,\n\nx(AB + D) - AB(D + AB) -24y =0\n\nFactor:\n\n(AB + D)(x - AB) -24y =0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, let's see if we can use equation from triangle AXD's circle.\n\nFrom triangle AXD, we had equation 2: x*(AB -10) =24 y.\n\nThus, y = [x*(AB -10)] /24.\n\nLet me substitute this into the equation above.\n\nSo, substituting y = [x(AB -10)] /24 into the equation from triangle BXC's circle equation:\n\nABx + Dx - D AB -24y - AB\u00b2 =0\n\nSubstitute y:\n\nABx + Dx - D AB -24*(x(AB -10)/24) - AB\u00b2 =0\n\nSimplify term with y:\n\n-24*(x(AB -10)/24) = -x(AB -10)\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nABx + Dx - D AB -x(AB -10) - AB\u00b2 =0\n\nExpand the terms:\n\nABx + Dx - D AB -ABx +10x - AB\u00b2 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nABx - ABx cancels.\n\nDx +10x - D AB - AB\u00b2 =0\n\nFactor x terms:\n\nx(D +10) - AB(D + AB) =0\n\nHm, so:\n\nx(D +10) = AB(D + AB)\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = [AB(D + AB)] / (D +10)\n\nHmm, so that's an expression for x in terms of AB and D.\n\nWe need another relation to connect D and AB. Let's recall that in the equation from the BXC circle's radius equation:\n\nD\u00b2 +4AB\u00b2 +4D AB -324 =0\n\nThat's equation (E), let's call it equation (3):\n\nD\u00b2 +4AB\u00b2 +4AB D -324 =0\n\nSo if we can express D in terms of AB or vice versa, we can solve.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can also get another equation from triangle AXD's circle equation.\n\nWait, from triangle AXD's circle equation, we had equation 2:\n\nx*(AB -10)=24 y, which gives y = (x (AB -10))/24. Also, from equation 1 (the right angle at X):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = AB x.\n\nLet me substitute y into equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + [ (x (AB -10)/24 )]^2 = AB x\n\nLet's compute this step by step.\n\nLet me denote AB as a variable, say let\u2019s let AB = m to make notation easier. Let me set m = AB. Then:\n\ny = (x (m -10))/24\n\nSubstituting into equation 1:\n\nx\u00b2 + [ (x (m -10)/24 )]^2 = m x\n\nMultiply through:\n\nx\u00b2 + [x\u00b2 (m -10)^2 ] / (24\u00b2) = m x\n\nMultiply all terms by 24\u00b2 to eliminate denominator:\n\n24\u00b2 x\u00b2 + x\u00b2 (m -10)^2 = 24\u00b2 m x\n\nFactor x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 [24\u00b2 + (m -10)^2 ] = 24\u00b2 m x\n\nAssuming x \u22600 (since if x=0, point X would be on AD, but angle AXB would be undefined or 180, so it can\u2019t be 90\u00b0, so x\u22600), we can divide both sides by x:\n\nx [24\u00b2 + (m -10)^2 ] =24\u00b2 m\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = [24\u00b2 m ] / [24\u00b2 + (m -10)^2 ]\n\nHmm, that's an expression for x in terms of m (AB). Let me note that.\n\nSimilarly, from the previous equation in triangle BXC's equation, we had:\n\nx = [m(D + m)] / (D +10)\n\nSo, equate the two expressions for x:\n\n[24\u00b2 m ] / [24\u00b2 + (m -10)^2 ] = [m(D + m)] / (D +10)\n\nAssuming m \u22600, we can divide both sides by m:\n\n24\u00b2 / [24\u00b2 + (m -10)^2 ] = (D + m)/ (D +10)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n24\u00b2 (D +10) = [24\u00b2 + (m -10)^2 ] (D + m )\n\nThis is getting quite involved. Let's see if we can also use equation (3):\n\nD\u00b2 +4m\u00b2 +4m D -324 =0\n\nWe need to find D in terms of m or vice versa. Let me see if we can express D from the previous equation and substitute into equation (3).\n\nLet\u2019s denote equation (4):\n\n24\u00b2 (D +10) = [24\u00b2 + (m -10)^2 ] (D + m )\n\nLet me expand the right-hand side:\n\n[24\u00b2 + (m\u00b2 -20m +100)] (D + m )\n\n= (24\u00b2 + m\u00b2 -20m +100)(D + m )\n\nLet me compute the terms:\n\nLet me compute 24\u00b2 first: 24^2 is 576.\n\nThus,\n\n[576 + m\u00b2 -20m +100]*(D + m) = [m\u00b2 -20m + 676]*(D + m)\n\nSo,\n\nLeft side: 576(D +10)\n\nRight side: (m\u00b2 -20m +676)(D +m)\n\nThus,\n\n576(D +10) = (m\u00b2 -20m +676)(D +m)\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to collect terms involving D:\n\nLeft side: 576D +5760\n\nRight side: (m\u00b2 -20m +676)D + (m\u00b2 -20m +676)m\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n576D +5760 - (m\u00b2 -20m +676)D - (m\u00b2 -20m +676)m =0\n\nFactor D terms:\n\nD[576 - (m\u00b2 -20m +676)] + [5760 - m(m\u00b2 -20m +676)] =0\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nFirst coefficient for D:\n\n576 - m\u00b2 +20m -676 = (-m\u00b2 +20m -100)\n\nSecond term:\n\n5760 - m\u00b3 +20m\u00b2 -676m = -m\u00b3 +20m\u00b2 -676m +5760\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n(-m\u00b2 +20m -100) D + (-m\u00b3 +20m\u00b2 -676m +5760) =0\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n[ -m\u00b2 +20m -100 ] D = m\u00b3 -20m\u00b2 +676m -5760\n\nTherefore,\n\nD = [ m\u00b3 -20m\u00b2 +676m -5760 ] / [ -m\u00b2 +20m -100 ]\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator if possible.\n\nFirst, note that denominator is -m\u00b2 +20m -100 = -(m\u00b2 -20m +100) = -(m -10)^2 - 0? Wait, m\u00b2 -20m +100 = (m -10)^2. Wait, (m -10)^2 = m\u00b2 -20m +100. Exactly. So denominator is - (m -10)^2.\n\nThus,\n\nD = [ m\u00b3 -20m\u00b2 +676m -5760 ] / [ - (m -10)^2 ]\n\nLet me write numerator as:\n\nm\u00b3 -20m\u00b2 +676m -5760\n\nPerhaps factor this numerator. Let me try to factor it. Let's see if (m -10) is a factor, since denominator has (m -10)^2.\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nLet me test m =10 as a root:\n\nPlug m=10 into numerator:\n\n1000 -2000 + 6760 -5760 = (1000 -2000) + (6760 -5760) = (-1000) + 1000 =0. Yes, so (m -10) is a factor.\n\nTherefore, numerator can be factored as (m -10)(something). Let's perform the division.\n\nDivide numerator m\u00b3 -20m\u00b2 +676m -5760 by (m -10).\n\nUsing polynomial long division:\n\nDivide m\u00b3 by m: m\u00b2. Multiply (m -10) by m\u00b2: m\u00b3 -10m\u00b2\n\nSubtract from numerator:\n\n(m\u00b3 -20m\u00b2 +676m -5760) - (m\u00b3 -10m\u00b2) = (-20m\u00b2 +10m\u00b2) +676m -5760 = (-10m\u00b2 +676m -5760)\n\nNow divide -10m\u00b2 by m: -10m. Multiply (m-10) by -10m: -10m\u00b2 +100m\n\nSubtract:\n\n(-10m\u00b2 +676m -5760) - (-10m\u00b2 +100m) = (676m -100m) -5760 = 576m -5760\n\nDivide 576m by m: 576. Multiply (m -10) by 576: 576m -5760\n\nSubtract:\n\n(576m -5760) - (576m -5760)=0\n\nThus, the numerator factors as (m -10)(m\u00b2 -10m +576)\n\nTherefore,\n\nD = [ (m -10)(m\u00b2 -10m +576) ] / [ - (m -10)^2 ]\n\nCancel (m-10):\n\nD = (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/ [ - (m -10) ]\n\n= - (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10)\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nD = - [ m\u00b2 -10m +576 ] / (m -10 )\n\nLet me perform polynomial division on m\u00b2 -10m +576 divided by (m -10):\n\nDivide m\u00b2 by m: m. Multiply (m -10) by m: m\u00b2 -10m\n\nSubtract from m\u00b2 -10m +576:\n\n(m\u00b2 -10m +576) - (m\u00b2 -10m) = 0 +0 +576 =576.\n\nThus,\n\nm\u00b2 -10m +576 = (m -10)m +576\n\nTherefore,\n\nD = - [ (m -10)m +576 ] / (m -10 )\n\n= - [ m + 576/(m -10) ]\n\nHmm, not sure if helpful. Alternatively:\n\nD = - [ (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10) ] = - [ m + 576/(m -10) ]\n\nAlternatively, perhaps keep it as D = - (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10)\n\nNow, going back to equation (3):\n\nD\u00b2 +4m\u00b2 +4m D -324 =0\n\nWe can substitute D here. Let me denote D as above.\n\nLet me plug D = - (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10) into equation (3):\n\nFirst, compute D\u00b2:\n\nD\u00b2 = [ (m\u00b2 -10m +576)^2 ] / (m -10)^2\n\nThen 4m D = 4m * [ - (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10) ] = -4m(m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10)\n\nSo putting into equation (3):\n\n[ (m\u00b2 -10m +576)^2 ]/(m -10)^2 +4m\u00b2 + [ -4m(m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10) ] -324 =0\n\nThis seems very complicated, but perhaps we can multiply through by (m -10)^2 to eliminate denominators.\n\nMultiply all terms by (m -10)^2:\n\n(m\u00b2 -10m +576)^2 +4m\u00b2 (m -10)^2 -4m(m\u00b2 -10m +576)(m -10) -324(m -10)^2 =0\n\nThis is getting quite involved, but let me expand each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (m\u00b2 -10m +576)^2.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nLet me denote A = m\u00b2 -10m, so term1 = (A +576)^2 = A\u00b2 + 1152A +576\u00b2\n\nA\u00b2 = (m\u00b2 -10m)^2 = m^4 -20m^3 +100m\u00b2\n\n1152A = 1152(m\u00b2 -10m) =1152m\u00b2 -11520m\n\n576\u00b2 = 331776\n\nSo term1 = m^4 -20m^3 +100m\u00b2 +1152m\u00b2 -11520m +331776\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nm^4 -20m\u00b3 + (100+1152)m\u00b2 + (-11520)m +331776\n\nSo:\n\nm^4 -20m\u00b3 +1252m\u00b2 -11520m +331776\n\nSecond term:4m\u00b2(m -10)^2\n\nFirst compute (m -10)^2 =m\u00b2 -20m +100\n\nMultiply by 4m\u00b2: 4m\u00b2*(m\u00b2 -20m +100)=4m^4 -80m\u00b3 +400m\u00b2\n\nThird term: -4m(m\u00b2 -10m +576)(m -10)\n\nFirst compute (m\u00b2 -10m +576)(m -10):\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nm\u00b2*m =m\u00b3\n\nm\u00b2*(-10)= -10m\u00b2\n\n-10m*m =-10m\u00b2\n\n-10m*(-10)=+100m\n\n576*m =576m\n\n576*(-10)= -5760\n\nCombine terms:\n\nm\u00b3 + (-10m\u00b2 -10m\u00b2) + (100m +576m) -5760\n\n= m\u00b3 -20m\u00b2 +676m -5760\n\nMultiply by -4m:\n\n-4m*(m\u00b3 -20m\u00b2 +676m -5760)= -4m^4 +80m\u00b3 -2704m\u00b2 +23040m\n\nFourth term: -324(m -10)^2\n\nCompute (m -10)^2 =m\u00b2 -20m +100\n\nMultiply by -324:\n\n-324m\u00b2 +6480m -32400\n\nNow, sum all four terms:\n\nTerm1 + Term2 + Term3 + Term4 =\n\n[ m^4 -20m\u00b3 +1252m\u00b2 -11520m +331776 ]\n\n+ [4m^4 -80m\u00b3 +400m\u00b2 ]\n\n+ [ -4m^4 +80m\u00b3 -2704m\u00b2 +23040m ]\n\n+ [ -324m\u00b2 +6480m -32400 ]\n\nLet me combine term by term:\n\nm^4 terms:\n\n1m^4 +4m^4 -4m^4 =1m^4\n\nm^3 terms:\n\n-20m\u00b3 -80m\u00b3 +80m\u00b3 = (-20 -80 +80)m\u00b3 = -20m\u00b3\n\nm^2 terms:\n\n1252m\u00b2 +400m\u00b2 -2704m\u00b2 -324m\u00b2 = (1252 +400 -2704 -324)m\u00b2\n\nCompute step by step:\n\n1252 +400 =1652\n\n1652 -2704 = -1052\n\n-1052 -324 = -1376\n\nSo, -1376m\u00b2\n\nm terms:\n\n-11520m +23040m +6480m = (-11520 +23040 +6480)m\n\n= (23040 -11520)=11520; 11520 +6480=18000\n\nThus, 18000m\n\nConstants:\n\n331776 -32400 = 331776 -32400 = 299376\n\nSo putting all together:\n\nm^4 -20m\u00b3 -1376m\u00b2 +18000m +299376 =0\n\nHmm, this quartic equation. Solving this would be quite challenging. Maybe there is a factor here. Let me see if (m - 26) is a factor? Let me try plugging m=26.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nm=26,\n\nm^4 =26^4= 26*26=676; 676*26=17576; 17576*26=456976\n\n-20m\u00b3= -20*(26)^3= -20*(17576)= -351520\n\n-1376m\u00b2= -1376*(676)= -1376*600= -825600, -1376*76= -104,  so total approx but exact:\n\nWait 676*1376: 676*(1300 +76)=676*1300 +676*76\n\n676*100=67,600; 676*300=202,800 \u2192 676*1300= 676*(1000+300)=676,000 +202,800=878,800\n\n676*76: 676*70=47,320; 676*6=4,056 \u2192 47,320+4,056=51,376.

Wait, actually, the term is -1376*(26)^2.\n\nWait, 26^2 =676, so -1376*676 = let's compute 1376*676:\n\nWell, 1376*600 = 825,600\n\n1376*76 = 1376*(70+6)= 96,320 +8,256= 104,576\n\nTotal 825,600 +104,576 = 930,176.

Not zero.\n\nMaybe m= something else. Alternatively, perhaps there was an error in expanding the terms.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better approach.\n\nLet me recall that in the problem, both triangles AXD and BXC are acute. Maybe using the fact that all angles are acute can give additional constraints?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry with AB as m, and set up equations for both circumradii and the right angle.\n\nWait, let's think of the coordinates again. Let me denote AB = m, so the rectangle has vertices A(0,0), B(m,0), C(m,24), D(0,24).\n\nPoint X is (x,y).\n\nFrom angle AXB =90\u00b0, we have x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = m x.\n\nFrom triangle AXD's circumradius 13:\n\nWe had earlier derived that x*(m -10)=24 y (equation 2). So y = x*(m-10)/24.\n\nSimilarly, let me handle triangle BXC's circumradius.\n\nFor triangle BXC with vertices at B(m,0), X(x,y), C(m,24). Let's compute its circumradius.\n\nSimilarly, the sides of triangle BXC are BX, XC, and BC=24.\n\nBX length: sqrt( (x - m)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC length: sqrt( (x - m)^2 + (y -24)^2 )\n\nBC length:24.\n\nThe area of triangle BXC can be computed as the area of the triangle with coordinates (m,0), (x,y), (m,24).\n\nUsing determinant formula:\n\nArea \u0394 = (1/2)| (m(y -24) + x(24 -0) + m(0 - y) ) |\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/2)| m(y -24) +24x -m y |\n\n= (1/2)| m y -24m +24x -m y |\n\n= (1/2)| -24m +24x | = (1/2)*24|x -m| =12|x - m|\n\nSince X is inside the rectangle, x < m, so |x -m|=m -x. Thus, area is 12(m -x).\n\nThe circumradius R2 = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394) = [ sqrt( (m -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (m -x)^2 + (y -24)^2 ) *24 ] / (4*12(m -x) )\n\nSimplify denominator:4*12(m -x)=48(m -x)\n\nNumerator:24 * sqrt( [ (m -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m -x)^2 + (y -24)^2 ] ) \n\nTherefore,\n\nR2 = [24 / 48(m -x) ] * sqrt( [ (m -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m -x)^2 + (y -24)^2 ] )\n\nSimplify 24/48 = 1/2, so:\n\nR2 = [1/(2(m -x))] * sqrt( [ (m -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m -x)^2 + (y -24)^2 ] ) \n\nGiven R2=15,\n\nThus,\n\n15 = [1/(2(m -x))] * sqrt( [ (m -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m -x)^2 + (y -24)^2 ] )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2(m -x):\n\n30(m -x) = sqrt( [ (m -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m -x)^2 + (y -24)^2 ] )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[30(m -x)]\u00b2 = [ (m -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m -x)^2 + (y -24)^2 ]\n\nLet me denote t = m -x. Then, since x = m -t, so substituting:\n\nLeft side: 900 t\u00b2\n\nRight side: [t\u00b2 + y\u00b2][ t\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 ]\n\nExpand the right side:\n\nLet me denote term1 = t\u00b2 + y\u00b2\n\nterm2 = t\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 = t\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -48y +576\n\nThus, term1 * term2 = (t\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(t\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -48y +576 )\n\nLet S = t\u00b2 + y\u00b2, then term1 = S, term2 = S -48y +576\n\nThus, the product is S(S -48y +576) = S\u00b2 + S(-48y +576)\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n900 t\u00b2 = S\u00b2 + S(-48y +576 )\n\nBut S = t\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n900 t\u00b2 = (t\u00b2 + y\u00b2)^2 + (t\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(-48y +576 )\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\nFirst, expand (t\u00b2 + y\u00b2)^2:\n\n= t^4 + 2 t\u00b2 y\u00b2 + y^4\n\nThen, the second term:\n\n(t\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(-48y +576) = -48y(t\u00b2 + y\u00b2) +576(t\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\n= -48y t\u00b2 -48y^3 +576 t\u00b2 +576 y\u00b2\n\nThus, total right-hand side:\n\nt^4 + 2 t\u00b2 y\u00b2 + y^4 -48y t\u00b2 -48y^3 +576 t\u00b2 +576 y\u00b2\n\nThis seems very complicated. Perhaps there's a smarter substitution.\n\nRecall from equation for angle AXB: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = m x. Since x = m - t,\n\nx = m - t => t = m -x,\n\nthus,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (m - t)^2 + y\u00b2 = m\u00b2 -2m t + t\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = m x = m(m -t)\n\nWait, let's compute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = m x,\n\n=> (m - t)^2 + y\u00b2 = m(m - t)\n\nExpand left side:\n\nm\u00b2 -2m t + t\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = m\u00b2 - m t\n\nThus,\n\n-2m t + t\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = -m t\n\n=> t\u00b2 -m t + y\u00b2 =0\n\nSo,\n\ny\u00b2 = m t - t\u00b2\n\nSo, we can express y\u00b2 in terms of t and m.\n\nLet me substitute this into the previous equations.\n\nFirst, S = t\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = t\u00b2 + (m t - t\u00b2)= m t\n\nSo S = m t\n\nTherefore, the right-hand side of the equation [30(m -x)]\u00b2 = [ (m -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m -x)^2 + (y -24)^2 ] becomes:\n\nS\u00b2 + S*(-48y +576) = (m t)^2 + m t*(-48y +576)\n\nTherefore,\n\n900 t\u00b2 = m\u00b2 t\u00b2 + m t*(-48y +576)\n\nDivide both sides by t (assuming t\u22600, which holds because x < m so t>0):\n\n900 t = m\u00b2 t + m*(-48y +576)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n900 t - m\u00b2 t +48 m y -576m =0\n\nFactor t:\n\nt(900 - m\u00b2) +48 m y -576m =0\n\nHmm, can we express y in terms of t and m? Recall from equation 2:\n\nFrom triangle AXD: x*(m -10)=24 y.

Perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nRecall that from triangle AXD's equation 2:\n\nx = [24\u00b2 m ] / [24\u00b2 + (m -10)^2 ]\n\nLet me denote that expression for x in terms of m.\n\nSimilarly, from equation for BXC's equation, we had:\n\nx = [m(D +m)] / (D +10)\n\nBut D was expressed in terms of m as:\n\nD = - (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10)\n\nThus substituting D into x expression:\n\nx = [m( - (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10) + m ) ] / [ - (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10) +10 ]\n\nThis is complicated, but let me compute numerator and denominator step by step.\n\nFirst numerator:\n\nm [ - (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10) + m ]\n\n= m [ - (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10) + m*(m -10)/(m -10) ]\n\n= m [ ( - (m\u00b2 -10m +576) + m(m -10) ) / (m -10) ]\n\nCompute numerator inside:\n\n- m\u00b2 +10m -576 +m\u00b2 -10m = (-m\u00b2 +m\u00b2) + (10m -10m) + (-576) = -576\n\nThus, numerator becomes m*(-576)/(m -10) = -576m/(m -10)\n\nDenominator of x expression:\n\n[ - (m\u00b2 -10m +576)/(m -10) +10 ]\n\n= [ - (m\u00b2 -10m +576) +10(m -10) ] / (m -10)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n- m\u00b2 +10m -576 +10m -100 = -m\u00b2 +20m -676\n\nThus, denominator of x is (-m\u00b2 +20m -676)/(m -10)\n\nTherefore, overall x expression:\n\nx = [ -576m/(m -10) ] / [ (-m\u00b2 +20m -676)/(m -10) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe (m -10) denominators cancel, so:\n\nx = -576m / (-m\u00b2 +20m -676) = 576m / (m\u00b2 -20m +676)\n\nBut from equation for x from triangle AXD:\n\nx = 24\u00b2 m / [24\u00b2 + (m -10)^2 ] = (576 m)/(576 + (m -10)^2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\n576m/(m\u00b2 -20m +676) = 576m/(576 + (m -10)^2 )\n\nSince denominators must be equal (since numerators are same and m\u22600):\n\nm\u00b2 -20m +676 =576 + (m -10)^2\n\nCompute RHS:\n\n576 + (m\u00b2 -20m +100)= m\u00b2 -20m +676\n\nThus,\n\nm\u00b2 -20m +676 = m\u00b2 -20m +676.\n\nThis is an identity, which means that the two expressions for x are consistent, which is good, but doesn't give new information.\n\nHmm, so this approach leads back to the same equation. Maybe we need to consider substituting y from equation 2 into the equation derived from triangle BXC's circumradius.\n\nRecall from equation 2: y = x*(m -10)/24. And from angle AXB: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = m x.\n\nLet me substitute y into the equation for triangle BXC's circumradius.\n\nFrom earlier, we had:\n\n30 t = m\u00b2 t + m*(-48y +576) where t = m -x.\n\nBut since y = x(m-10)/24, let's substitute that.\n\nFirst compute -48y +576 = -48*(x(m-10)/24) +576 = -2x(m -10) +576.\n\nThus,\n\n30 t = m\u00b2 t + m*(-2x(m-10) +576 )\n\nBut t = m -x, so substitute t:\n\n30(m -x) = m\u00b2 (m -x) + m*(-2x(m-10) +576 )\n\nExpand the right-hand side:\n\nm\u00b2(m -x) -2m\u00b2 x(m -10)/x?

So,\n\n13 = (1/(2x)) * sqrt{(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24\u2212y)^2)}\n\n=> 26x = sqrt{(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24\u2212y)^2)}\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n676x\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24\u2212y)^2)\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC with circumradius 15:\n\nBX=\u221a((m\u2212x)^2 + y\u00b2), XC=\u221a((m\u2212x)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2), BC=24.\n\nArea \u0394=12(m\u2212x).\n\nThus,\n\n15= [BX * XC * BC]/ (4\u0394) = [\u221a((m\u2212x)^2 + y\u00b2) * \u221a((m\u2212x)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2)*24]/ (48(m\u2212x))\n\nSimplify:\n\n15 = [24/(48(m\u2212x))] * sqrt{ [ (m\u2212x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m\u2212x)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2 ] }\n\n=> 15 = [1/(2(m\u2212x))] * sqrt{ [ (m\u2212x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m\u2212x)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2 ] }\n\nMultiply both sides by 2(m\u2212x):\n\n30(m\u2212x) = sqrt{ [ (m\u2212x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m\u2212x)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2 ] }\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n900(m\u2212x)^2 = [ (m\u2212x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m\u2212x)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2 ]\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) 676x\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24\u2212y)^2 )\n\n2) 900(m\u2212x)^2 = [ (m\u2212x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (m\u2212x)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2 ]\n\nAlso, angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = m x.\n\nLet me denote S = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = m x.\n\nLet me also denote t = m -x, so that (m -x)^2 = t\u00b2.\n\nThen, the second equation becomes:\n\n900 t\u00b2 = [ t\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ][ t\u00b2 + (24\u2212y)^2 ]\n\nLet me denote U = (24\u2212y). Then, the second equation:\n\n900 t\u00b2 = (t\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(t\u00b2 + U\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, the first equation:\n\n676 x\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + U\u00b2 )\n\nNote that U =24\u2212y, so U =24\u2212y.\n\nLet me see if I can find a relationship between the two equations.\n\nLet me denote for the first equation:\n\nLet me set A =x\u00b2, B = y\u00b2. Then U =24\u2212y, so U\u00b2 = (24\u2212y)^2.\n\nFirst equation: 676x\u00b2 = (A + B)(A + (U)^2 )\n\nSecond equation: Let me denote t = m -x, so (m -x)^2 = t\u00b2. Let me also denote C = t\u00b2 = (m -x)^2.\n\nThen second equation: 900 C = (C + B)(C + U\u00b2 )\n\nAlso, we know from angle AXB: A + B = m x.\n\nAdditionally, since U =24\u2212y, then y + U =24, so U =24 -y.\n\nAlso, since X is inside the rectangle, 0 < y <24, so U is between 0 and24.\n\nLet me try to express both equations in terms of A, B, C, U.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n676 A = (A + B)(A + U\u00b2 )\n\nSecond equation:\n\n900 C = (C + B)(C + U\u00b2 )\n\nAlso, A + B = m x, and C = (m -x)^2.\n\nAdditionally, U =24\u2212y \u2192 y =24 - U \u2192 B = y\u00b2 = (24 - U)^2.\n\nThus, B = (24 - U)^2.\n\nLet me substitute B into the equations.\n\nFirst equation:\n\n676A = [A + (24 - U)^2][A + U\u00b2 ]\n\nSecond equation:\n\n900C = [C + (24 - U)^2][C + U\u00b2 ]\n\nLet me see if we can set variables such that A and C are related through m x and (m -x)^2.\n\nAlso, since A =x\u00b2 and C = (m -x)^2, so A + C =x\u00b2 + (m -x)^2 =x\u00b2 +m\u00b2 -2m x +x\u00b2 =2x\u00b2 -2m x +m\u00b2.\n\nBut also, since A =x\u00b2 and A + B = m x, then:\n\nA + (24 - U)^2 = m x.\n\nWait, B = (24 - U)^2 = y\u00b2, so A + B = m x \u2192 x\u00b2 + (24 - U)^2 = m x.\n\nBut U =24 - y, which is U =24 - y, so maybe this substitution isn't buying us much.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables A and C as two variables satisfying similar equations, with U being a common term.\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet me denote for the first equation:\n\nLet me call the first equation (for A):\n\n676A = (A + B)(A + U\u00b2 )\n\nBut B = (24 - U)^2, so:\n\n676A = (A + (24 - U)^2)(A + U\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation (for C):\n\n900C = (C + (24 - U)^2)(C + U\u00b2 )\n\nThis is interesting. So both A and C satisfy the same type of equation but with different constants (676 vs 900).\n\nLet me consider the general equation:\n\nK * Z = (Z + (24 - U)^2)(Z + U\u00b2 )\n\nWhere for the first equation, K=676, Z=A, and for the second equation, K=900, Z=C.\n\nSo, solving for Z in terms of U.\n\nLet me expand the RHS:\n\n(Z + (24 - U)^2)(Z + U\u00b2 ) = Z\u00b2 + Z U\u00b2 + Z (24 - U)^2 + (24 - U)^2 U\u00b2\n\n= Z\u00b2 + Z[ U\u00b2 + (24 - U)^2 ] + (24 - U)^2 U\u00b2\n\nThus, equation:\n\nK Z = Z\u00b2 + Z[ U\u00b2 + (24 - U)^2 ] + (24 - U)^2 U\u00b2\n\nRearrange:\n\nZ\u00b2 + Z[ U\u00b2 + (24 - U)^2 - K ] + (24 - U)^2 U\u00b2 =0\n\nThis is a quadratic in Z:\n\nZ\u00b2 + Z[ (U\u00b2 + (24 - U)^2 - K) ] + (24 - U)^2 U\u00b2 =0\n\nLet me compute U\u00b2 + (24 - U)^2:\n\nU\u00b2 + (24 - U)^2 = U\u00b2 + 576 -48U + U\u00b2 = 2U\u00b2 -48U +576.\n\nThus,\n\nEquation becomes:\n\nZ\u00b2 + Z[ 2U\u00b2 -48U +576 - K ] + (24 - U)^2 U\u00b2 =0\n\nLet me see if this quadratic has solutions for Z. The discriminant must be non-negative.\n\nDiscriminant D:\n\n[2U\u00b2 -48U +576 - K]^2 -4*1*(24 - U)^2 U\u00b2\n\n= [ (2U\u00b2 -48U +576 - K)^2 -4U\u00b2(24 - U)^2 ]\n\nThis is quite involved, but perhaps for the two equations (with K=676 and K=900), the solutions for Z (A and C) must be real and positive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two equations can be related.\n\nLet me suppose that U is a constant for both equations. Since U is the same in both equations, perhaps there's a relationship between A and C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set U such that both equations can be satisfied with the same U.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that since A =x\u00b2 and C= (m -x)^2, then sqrt(A) + sqrt(C) =x + (m -x)=m.\n\nThus, sqrt(A) + sqrt(C)=m.\n\nThis suggests that A and C are related such that their square roots add to m. Maybe this can be used alongside the quadratic equations.\n\nThis is getting too abstract. Perhaps plugging in specific values.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the problem is from a competition, so maybe the answer is an integer. Let me guess that AB is 26, since 13 and 15 are given as radii, which are half of 26 and 30 (but 30 is too big). Alternatively, 25?\n\nWait, let me think of the triangle AXD with circumradius 13. The hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with that would be 26, but since it's acute, perhaps the longest side is less than 26. Wait, but the hypotenuse for the circumradius is 2R. So if it were right-angled, the hypotenuse would be 26, but since it's acute, all sides are less than that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the length AD is 24, which is fixed. Maybe the triangle AXD has sides such that its longest side is less than 26, so 24 is one side, and the other sides are such that the circumradius is 13. Let me see:\n\nFor triangle AXD, sides are AX, XD, and AD=24. The circumradius R=13. Then,\n\nUsing formula R = (a b c)/(4\u0394). Let's suppose the longest side is AD=24, then:\n\n13 = (AX * XD * 24)/(4\u0394)\n\nBut the area \u0394=12x, so substituting:\n\n13 = (AX * XD *24)/(48x) \u2192 same as before.\n\nAlternatively, if the longest side is not AD, but AX or XD. Suppose AX is the longest side. Then AX must be <2*13=26.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, the circumradius is 15, so the longest side must be <30.\n\nPerhaps the key is to consider coordinates where equations can be satisfied with integer values.\n\nLet me suppose that AB is 26. Let's test m=26.\n\nIf m=26, then from equation 2:\n\ny =x*(26 -10)/24 =x*16/24 = (2/3)x.\n\nFrom angle AXB: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =26x. Substitute y=(2/3)x:\n\nx\u00b2 + (4/9)x\u00b2 =26x\n\n(13/9)x\u00b2 =26x \u21d2 (13/9)x =26 \u21d2x=26*(9/13)= 18.\n\nThus x=18, y=(2/3)*18=12.\n\nSo coordinates of X would be (18,12).\n\nNow let's check if triangle AXD has circumradius 13.\n\nPoints A(0,0), X(18,12), D(0,24).\n\nCompute sides:\n\nAX: distance from (0,0) to (18,12): \u221a(18\u00b2 +12\u00b2)=\u221a(324+144)=\u221a468=\u221a(4*117)=2\u221a117\u2248?\n\nXD: distance from (18,12) to (0,24): \u221a(18\u00b2 + (12)^2)= same as AX? Wait, no:\n\nWait, point D is (0,24). So from X(18,12) to D(0,24):\n\n\u0394x= -18, \u0394y=12. So distance is \u221a(18\u00b2 +12\u00b2)= same as AX: \u221a(324 +144)=\u221a468.\n\nAD is 24.\n\nThus, triangle AXD has sides 2\u221a117, 2\u221a117, and 24.\n\nCompute its circumradius R:\n\nUsing formula R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394). Compute area first.\n\nArea of triangle AXD: since it's a triangle with base AD=24 and height x=18 (from A to D is vertical, and X's x-coordinate is 18). Wait, no, area is 12x =12*18=216.\n\nAlternatively, using coordinates: area is \u00bd |0*(12-24)+18*(24-0)+0*(0-12)| =\u00bd |0 +432 +0|=216, same.\n\nThus,\n\nR = (2\u221a117 * 2\u221a117 *24 )/(4*216)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n2\u221a117 *2\u221a117 =4*117=468; 468*24=11,232\n\nDenominator:4*216=864\n\nThus R=11,232 /864 = 13. Exactly! So that works.\n\nNow check triangle BXC with m=26.\n\nPoints B(26,0), X(18,12), C(26,24).\n\nCompute sides:\n\nBX: distance from (26,0) to (18,12): \u221a(8\u00b2 +12\u00b2)=\u221a(64+144)=\u221a208=4\u221a13\u2248?\n\nXC: distance from (18,12) to C(26,24): \u221a(8\u00b2 +12\u00b2)= same as BX: \u221a208.\n\nBC=24.\n\nThus, triangle BXC has sides 4\u221a13,4\u221a13,24.\n\nCompute its circumradius R.\n\nArea of triangle BXC: \u00bd*(26 -18)*(24)= \u00bd*8*24=96? Wait, using coordinates:\n\nArea: \u00bd |26*(12-24)+18*(24-0)+26*(0-12)| \n\nWait, determinant:\n\nCoordinates: B(26,0), X(18,12), C(26,24).\n\nArea = \u00bd |26*(12 -24) +18*(24 -0) +26*(0 -12)|\n\n= \u00bd |26*(-12) +18*24 +26*(-12)|\n\n= \u00bd | -312 +432 -312 |\n\n= \u00bd |( -312 -312 ) +432 | =\u00bd | -624 +432 | =\u00bd | -192 | =96.\n\nThus, area is 96.\n\nCircumradius R = (4\u221a13 *4\u221a13 *24)/(4*96)\n\nNumerator: (16*13)*24 =208*24=5,000 (Wait 16*13=208; 208*24=5,000 - no, 200*24=4800, 8*24=192 \u2192 total 4992).\n\nDenominator:4*96=384.\n\nThus R=4992 /384 =13. Hmm, but we needed 15.\n\nWait, that's a problem. For triangle BXC, we expected circumradius 15, but with m=26, it's 13. So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm, so m=26 works for AXD but not BXC.\n\nHmm, maybe m=30?\n\nLet's try m=30.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\ny =x*(30 -10)/24 =x*(20)/24= (5/6)x.\n\nFrom angle AXB equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =30x.\n\nSubstitute y=5x/6:\n\nx\u00b2 +25x\u00b2/36=30x \u21d2 (61/36)x\u00b2 =30x \u21d2 (61/36)x=30 \u21d2x=30*(36/61)= 1080/61\u224817.7049.\n\nThen y=(5/6)* (1080/61)= (5/6)*(1080/61)= (900)/61\u224814.754.\n\nNow check triangle AXD:\n\nPoints A(0,0), X(1080/61, 900/61), D(0,24).\n\nCompute sides:\n\nAX: distance from A to X: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt( (1080/61)^2 + (900/61)^2 ) = (1/61)sqrt(1080\u00b2 +900\u00b2)\n\nCalculate 1080\u00b2 = (108)^2*100=11664*100=1,166,400\n\n900\u00b2=810,000\n\nTotal inside sqrt:1,166,400+810,000=1,976,400 \u2192 sqrt(1,976,400)=1406 (since 1400\u00b2=1,960,000; 1406\u00b2= (1400+6)^2=1400\u00b2+2*1400*6+36=1,960,000+16,800+36=1,976,836.

Let me see:\n\nNotice that 1,372,500 = (750^2 +900^2) and 880,596 = (750^2 +564^2).\n\nAlternatively, notice that (750\u00b2+900\u00b2)(750\u00b2+564\u00b2) = [(750\u00b2)^2 +750\u00b2*(900\u00b2+564\u00b2)+ (900*564)^2]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is a perfect square?\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me compute sqrt(1,372,500 *880,596).\n\nFactor each term:\n\n1,372,500 =1,3725 *100= (13725)*100. 13725 divided by 25=549, so 1,372,500=25*549*100=25*100*549=2500*549.\n\nSimilarly 880,596: divide by 4=220,149. 220,149 \u00f73=73,383. \u00f73=24,461. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is (750*564 +900*750)^2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire expression simplifies to (something)^2.\n\nAlternatively, compute numerically:\n\nsqrt(1,372,500 *880,596)=sqrt(1,372,500) * sqrt(880,596)\n\nsqrt(1,372,500)= approx 1172 (since 1172^2=1,373,584), so approx 1172- (1,373,584 -1,372,500)= 1,084 difference \u2192 approx 1172- 1,084/(2*1172) \u22481172-0.46\u22481171.54.\n\nsqrt(880,596)= let's see sqrt(880,596)= 938.46 (since 938\u00b2=880, 938*938=880,  but exact?\n\nCompute 938^2= (900+38)^2= 810,000 +2*900*38 +38\u00b2= 810,000+68,400+1,444= 879,844.\n\n939\u00b2=938\u00b2+2*938+1=879,844+1,876+1= 881,721.\n\nThus sqrt(880,596) is between 938 and 939. 880,596-879,844=752 \u2192 752/(2*938)\u22480.40, so approx 938.40.\n\nThus total sqrt product\u22481171.54 *938.40\u22481171.54*900=1,054,386 +1171.54*38.40\u224844,955 \u2192 total\u22481,099,341.\n\nThus, R2\u22481,099,341 / (61*1500)=1,099,341/(91,500)\u224812.015. Hmm, not 15.\n\nHmm, so m=30 gives R2\u224812, which is wrong.\n\nHmm, so maybe my assumption is wrong. Perhaps I need to find another way.\n\nWait, earlier when I tried m=26, triangle BXC had R=13 but needed 15. If I can find m such that for triangle BXC, the circumradius is 15.\n\nLet me think of the equations again. For triangle BXC:\n\nWe had for m=26:\n\nR= sqrt{(750\u00b2+900\u00b2)(750\u00b2+564\u00b2)} / (61*1500 )\n\nWait, but in that case, m=26 would give different numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 26.\n\nWait, but when m=26, triangle AXD has R=13, which is correct, and BXC's R=13, which was wrong.\n\nWait, but in the problem, both triangles must be acute. So perhaps those points where R=13 for BXC (m=26) make it a right or obtuse triangle?\n\nWait when m=26, triangle BXC had sides 4\u221a13,4\u221a13,24. The longest side is 24. Let's see if it's acute:\n\nIn a triangle, it's acute if all angles are less than 90\u00b0, which requires that for each side, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 > c\u00b2, where c is the longest side.\n\nFor triangle BXC with sides 4\u221a13\u224814.42, 4\u221a13, and 24:\n\nCheck 14.42\u00b2 +14.42\u00b2 >24\u00b2 ?\n\n14.42\u00b2=208, so 208+208=416. 24\u00b2=576. 416 <576. Thus the triangle is obtuse, contradicting the problem's condition that both triangles are acute.\n\nAh, so m=26 is invalid because triangle BXC is obtuse.\n\nHmm, so need to find m where both triangles are acute.\n\nMaybe m= 25?\n\nLet me try m=25.\n\nEquation 2:\n\ny= x*(25-10)/24= (15/24)x=5x/8.\n\nFrom angle AXB:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2=25x \u2192 x\u00b2 +25x\u00b2/64=25x \u21d2 (89x\u00b2)/64=25x \u21d2 x= (25*64)/89\u2248(1600)/89\u224817.98.\n\nThus x\u224818, y\u2248(5/8)*18\u224811.25.\n\nCompute triangle AXD's circumradius:\n\nPoints A(0,0), X(18,11.25), D(0,24).\n\nAX=\u221a(18\u00b2+11.25\u00b2)=\u221a(324+126.56)=\u221a450.56\u224821.23.\n\nXD= distance to D: sqrt(18\u00b2 + (24-11.25)^2)=sqrt(324 + 164.06)=sqrt(488.06)\u224822.1.\n\nAD=24.\n\nThe sides are \u224821.23,22.1,24.\n\nCheck if acute:\n\n21.23\u00b2+22.1\u00b2\u2248450+488\u2248938 vs 24\u00b2=576. 938>576, so acute.\n\nCircumradius R1= (a*b*c)/(4\u0394).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with BC = 24. There's a point X inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, and their circumradii are 13 and 15 respectively. I need to find the length of AB. Hmm, let me try to visualize this first.\n\nAlright, let me start by drawing the rectangle ABCD. Let me label the rectangle so that AB is one side, BC is 24, which would be the length of the side opposite to AD. Since it's a rectangle, all angles are right angles. Let me consider coordinates to make this easier. Maybe placing the rectangle on a coordinate system where point A is at the origin (0,0), so then B would be at (AB, 0), C would be at (AB, 24), and D at (0,24). That way, BC is vertical with length 24, which matches the given.\n\nNow, point X is inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. So if A is (0,0) and B is (AB,0), then point X must satisfy the condition that the vectors AX and BX are perpendicular. Let me denote the coordinates of X as (x,y). Then vector AX is (x, y) and vector BX is (x - AB, y). Their dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular:\n\nx*(x - AB) + y*y = 0.\n\nSo that's equation one: x\u00b2 - AB*x + y\u00b2 = 0. (1)\n\nNext, we have triangles AXD and BXC. Both are acute and have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively. Let me recall that the circumradius of a triangle with sides a, b, c is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area. Alternatively, for a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse, but these triangles are acute, so they can't be right-angled. Hmm, so maybe I need to use the formula R = a/(2*sin A) where A is the angle opposite side a. Since the triangle is acute, all angles are less than 90 degrees, so the sines will be positive and less than 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let's see. Let me write coordinates for points A, B, C, D again:\n\nA: (0,0)\n\nB: (c, 0) where c = AB (this is what we need to find)\n\nC: (c, 24)\n\nD: (0,24)\n\nPoint X: (x,y) inside the rectangle, so 0 < x < c and 0 < y <24.\n\nFirst, triangle AXD: points A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). Let me compute its sides.\n\nAX: distance from A to X is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nXD: distance from X to D is sqrt((x - 0)^2 + (y -24)^2) = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2).\n\nAD: distance from A to D is 24, since it's a rectangle side.\n\nSo triangle AXD has sides AX, XD, and AD. Wait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, so it's fixed at 24. Wait, but in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, actually, AD is not part of the triangle unless X is connected to A and D. Wait, triangle AXD is indeed formed by points A, X, D. So sides are AX, XD, and AD. But AD is 24. So the sides are AX, XD, 24. But since the triangle is acute, all angles must be less than 90 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, triangle BXC is formed by points B(c,0), X(x,y), C(c,24). So sides would be BX, XC, and BC (which is 24). The sides are BX, XC, and BC. Again, BC is 24. So triangle BXC has sides BX, XC, and 24, and it's acute. The circumradius for triangle AXD is 13, and for BXC is 15.\n\nHmm. Let me recall that the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area. Alternatively, using coordinates, maybe we can compute the circumradius via coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, since triangle AXD is triangle with vertices at (0,0), (x,y), (0,24). Let me compute its circumradius.\n\nThe circumradius formula for a triangle with coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) can be found using determinant formulas, but maybe it's easier to use the formula in terms of sides.\n\nLet me denote for triangle AXD:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the sides:\n\nAX: length sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nXD: sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2)\n\nAD: 24\n\nLet\u2019s denote the sides as follows:\n\nLet a = XD, b = AD =24, c = AX\n\nWait, but actually, I need to assign sides properly. Let me consider the triangle AXD. The three sides are between A and X: AX, between X and D: XD, and between D and A: DA=24. So sides are AX, XD, DA (24). Similarly for BXC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to denote the sides as follows:\n\nFor triangle AXD:\n\nLet\u2019s call the sides opposite to angles at A, X, D as follows:\n\nOpposite angle at A is XD,\n\nopposite angle at X is AD (24),\n\nopposite angle at D is AX.\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me just denote the sides:\n\nLet\u2019s name the triangle AXD, with vertices A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). Let's compute the lengths:\n\nAX = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\nXD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2),\n\nAD = 24.\n\nSo sides are AX, XD, AD.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC:\n\nBX = sqrt( (c - x)^2 + y^2 ),\n\nXC = sqrt( (c - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ),\n\nBC =24.\n\nSo sides are BX, XC, BC.\n\nGiven that both triangles are acute, so all angles less than 90 degrees. So in triangle AXD, all angles are acute, so for example, AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2, etc. But perhaps that's more complicated. Maybe focus on the circumradius first.\n\nThe circumradius R of triangle AXD is given as 13. Let me use the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394). Let me compute the area \u0394 of triangle AXD.\n\nArea of triangle AXD: since points A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). The area can be calculated via determinant:\n\n\u0394_ADX = (1/2)*| (0*(y -24) + x*(24 -0) + 0*(0 - y) ) | = (1/2)*|24x| = 12|x|. Since X is inside the rectangle, x is between 0 and c, so positive, so \u0394_ADX = 12x.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC: points B(c,0), X(x,y), C(c,24). Area \u0394_BXC would be (1/2)*| (c*(y -24) + x*(24 -0) + c*(0 - y) ) |. Wait, maybe better to do the same way:\n\nUsing coordinates for BXC: the area is (1/2)*base*height. Since B and C are at (c,0) and (c,24), so the vertical side BC is 24, and the horizontal distance from X to the line BC (which is vertical at x=c) is (c -x). Wait, actually, perhaps the area can be calculated as (1/2)*horizontal base * vertical height?\n\nAlternatively, using determinant:\n\n\u0394_BXC = (1/2)*| (c*(y -24) + x*(24 -0) + c*(0 - y) ) |.\n\nWait, let's compute it properly:\n\nThe determinant formula is:\n\n\u0394 = (1/2)| x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2) |.\n\nSo for points B(c,0) = (x1,y1), X(x,y)=(x2,y2), C(c,24)=(x3,y3):\n\n\u0394 = (1/2)| c*(y -24) + x*(24 -0) + c*(0 - y) |\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: c*(y -24)\n\nSecond term: x*24\n\nThird term: c*(-y)\n\nSo adding them:\n\nc*y -24c +24x -c*y = -24c +24x\n\nThus, absolute value:\n\n| -24(c - x) | = 24(c -x)\n\nSo \u0394_BXC = (1/2)*24(c - x) = 12(c -x).\n\nOkay, so areas for both triangles are 12x and 12(c -x) respectively.\n\nNow, let's get back to the circumradius formula for triangle AXD:\n\nR_ADX = (AX * XD * AD) / (4 * \u0394_ADX) = 13.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAX = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\nXD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2),\n\nAD =24,\n\n\u0394_ADX =12x.\n\nSo,\n\n( sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) *24 ) / (4*12x ) =13\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12x =48x,\n\nNumerator: 24 * sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[24 * sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / (48x) =13\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 24:\n\n[ sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / (2x) =13\n\nMultiply both sides by 2x:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 26x\n\nHmm, that's equation (2).\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, circumradius is 15:\n\nR_BXC = (BX * XC * BC)/(4 * \u0394_BXC) =15\n\nCompute each term:\n\nBX = sqrt( (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC = sqrt( (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nBC =24,\n\n\u0394_BXC =12(c -x)\n\nPlugging into the formula:\n\n[ sqrt( (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) *24 ] / [4*12(c -x) ] =15\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12(c -x)=48(c -x)\n\nNumerator:24 * sqrt(...) * sqrt(...) \n\nSo,\n\n[24 * sqrt( (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / [48(c -x) ] =15\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 24:\n\n[ sqrt( (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / [2(c -x) ] =15\n\nMultiply both sides by 2(c -x):\n\nsqrt( (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =30(c -x)\n\nThat's equation (3).\n\nSo now, equations (2) and (3) are:\n\n(2): sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =26x,\n\n(3): sqrt( (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =30(c -x)\n\nAlso, equation (1): x\u00b2 - c x + y\u00b2=0 (from angle AXB being 90 degrees).\n\nSo we have three equations here with variables x, y, c. We need to solve for c, which is AB.\n\nThis seems quite involved. Let me see if there's a way to simplify these equations.\n\nFirst, note that equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = c x. So that's helpful. Let me see if I can express some terms in equations (2) and (3) using this.\n\nStarting with equation (2):\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =26x\n\nBut from equation (1), x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = c x. So sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(c x).\n\nSo equation (2) becomes sqrt(c x) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =26x.\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(c x)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = (26x)^2 =676x\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by x (assuming x \u22600, which it must be because X is inside the rectangle, so x>0):\n\nc (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =676x\n\nHmm, okay. Let me note that.\n\nSimilarly, for equation (3):\n\nsqrt( (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =30(c -x)\n\nSimilarly, let me see if I can express (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2. Let me note that (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 = (c\u00b2 - 2c x +x\u00b2) + y\u00b2. From equation (1), x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x, so substitute:\n\n(c\u00b2 -2c x + (c x)) = c\u00b2 - c x.\n\nTherefore, (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 = c\u00b2 -c x + (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 - c x)? Wait, wait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 = c\u00b2 - 2c x +x\u00b2 + y\u00b2. But x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x from equation (1). So substitute:\n\n= c\u00b2 -2c x + (c x) = c\u00b2 -c x.\n\nSo that's neat! Therefore, (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 = c(c -x). Similarly, perhaps the other term in equation (3):\n\n( (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nHmm, let me compute that:\n\n(c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = (c\u00b2 - 2c x +x\u00b2) + (24\u00b2 -48 y + y\u00b2)\n\nAgain, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = c x, so substitute:\n\n= c\u00b2 -2c x + (c x) + 24\u00b2 -48 y\n\n= c\u00b2 -c x + 576 -48 y\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet.\n\nBut let's see equation (3):\n\nsqrt( (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =30(c -x)\n\nWe can substitute sqrt( (c -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) = sqrt(c(c -x)) (from above)\n\nSo sqrt(c(c -x)) * sqrt( (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =30(c -x)\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\nc(c -x) * [ (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] =900(c -x)^2\n\nAssuming c -x \u22600 (since X is inside the rectangle, so x <c, so c -x >0), so we can divide both sides by (c -x):\n\nc [ (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] =900(c -x)\n\nHmm, okay. Let me note that.\n\nSo now, equations (2) and (3) after substitution:\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\nc (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =676x (Equation 2a)\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\nc [ (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] =900(c -x) (Equation 3a)\n\nAlso, equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x (Equation 1)\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can find expressions for (24 - y)^2 from equation (1).\n\nLet me compute (24 - y)^2 = 24\u00b2 -48 y + y\u00b2 = 576 -48 y + y\u00b2.\n\nFrom equation (1), y\u00b2 =c x -x\u00b2, so substitute:\n\n(24 - y)^2 = 576 -48 y + (c x -x\u00b2)\n\nHmm, but that still has y term. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote S = x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 and T = (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2.\n\nWait, perhaps let me consider equations 2a and 3a again.\n\nEquation 2a: c S =676x, where S =x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2.\n\nEquation 3a: c T =900(c -x), where T=(c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2.\n\nAlso, note that T = (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2. Let me see if S and T can be related.\n\nLet me compute T - S:\n\nT - S = [ (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] - [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ]\n\n= (c -x)^2 -x\u00b2 = c\u00b2 -2c x +x\u00b2 -x\u00b2 =c\u00b2 -2c x\n\nSo T = S + c\u00b2 -2c x\n\nHmm, that's useful.\n\nSo substituting into equation 3a:\n\nc*(S + c\u00b2 - 2c x) =900(c -x)\n\nBut from equation 2a, c S =676x, so S = (676x)/c.\n\nTherefore,\n\nc*( (676x)/c + c\u00b2 -2c x ) =900(c -x)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: c*(676x/c) =676x,\n\nSecond term: c*(c\u00b2) =c\u00b3,\n\nThird term: c*(-2c x)= -2c\u00b2x,\n\nSo altogether:\n\n676x + c\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x =900(c -x)\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n676x +c\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x -900c +900x =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(676x +900x) +c\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x -900c =0\n\n1576x +c\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x -900c =0\n\nHmm, factor terms with c\u00b3 and c\u00b2x:\n\nc\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x +1576x -900c =0\n\nHmm, perhaps factor c from first three terms? Wait:\n\nWait, c\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x =c\u00b2(c -2x). Then the remaining terms:\n\n+1576x -900c.\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me see if there's another relation to substitute.\n\nFrom equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x. Also, in equation (2a), we have S =x\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + 576 -48y = c x +576 -48y.\n\nTherefore, S =c x +576 -48y.\n\nBut equation 2a says c S =676x. So,\n\nc*(c x +576 -48y) =676x,\n\n=> c\u00b2x +576c -48c y =676x,\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nc\u00b2x -676x +576c -48c y =0,\n\nx (c\u00b2 -676) + c(576 -48 y)=0,\n\nHmm, perhaps solving for y?\n\nAlternatively, maybe express y from equation (1):\n\nFrom equation (1): y\u00b2 =c x -x\u00b2,\n\nbut that might not help directly. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that in equation (3a):\n\nT = (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2,\n\nand T can also be expressed as S +c\u00b2 -2c x (from earlier). So maybe that's already used.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find an expression for (24 - y). Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since we have equations with variables x,y,c, maybe we can find another relation between x and y.\n\nWait, let's recall that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so perhaps the coordinates of X lie on the circle with diameter AB? Wait, no, because angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so actually, point X lies on the circle with diameter AB. Wait, but in a rectangle, AB is a side, so the circle with diameter AB would have center at (c/2,0) and radius c/2. However, since X is inside the rectangle, which has height 24, so the circle might not reach up to y=24, but perhaps X is on that circle?\n\nWait, actually, yes! The locus of points X such that angle AXB is 90\u00b0 is indeed the circle with diameter AB. So point X must lie on that circle. Therefore, the coordinates of X satisfy the equation of that circle.\n\nThe equation of the circle with diameter AB (from A(0,0) to B(c,0)) is:\n\n(x - c/2)^2 + y^2 = (c/2)^2,\n\nExpanding this:\n\nx\u00b2 -c x + (c\u00b2)/4 + y\u00b2 =c\u00b2/4,\n\nThus, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -c x =0,\n\nWhich is exactly equation (1). So that's consistent. So that's good, so equation (1) comes from the circle condition.\n\nTherefore, we can perhaps use coordinate geometry here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variables substitution.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote variables:\n\nLet me set variables u =x, v = y. Then equation (1): u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 =c u,\n\nEquation (2a): c (u\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2 ) =676 u,\n\nEquation (3a): c [ (c -u)^2 + (24 -v)^2 ] =900 (c -u).\n\nHmm, perhaps express (24 - v)^2 from equation (2a):\n\nFrom equation (2a):\n\nc (u\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2 ) =676 u,\n\n=> (24 -v)^2 = (676 u)/c -u\u00b2,\n\nSimilarly, in equation (3a):\n\nc [ (c -u)^2 + (24 -v)^2 ] =900(c -u),\n\nWe can substitute (24 -v)^2 from above:\n\n(c -u)^2 + (676 u)/c -u\u00b2,\n\nSo let's compute (c -u)^2 + (676 u)/c -u\u00b2:\n\nExpand (c -u)^2: c\u00b2 -2c u +u\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nc\u00b2 -2c u +u\u00b2 + (676 u)/c -u\u00b2\n\n= c\u00b2 -2c u + (676 u)/c.\n\nTherefore, equation (3a) becomes:\n\nc [ c\u00b2 -2c u + (676 u)/c ] =900(c -u)\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nc*(c\u00b2) -c*(2c u) +c*(676 u)/c\n\n= c\u00b3 -2c\u00b2 u +676 u.\n\nSo:\n\nc\u00b3 -2c\u00b2 u +676u =900(c -u)\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nc\u00b3 -2c\u00b2 u +676u -900c +900u =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nc\u00b3 -2c\u00b2 u + (676u +900u) -900c =0\n\nc\u00b3 -2c\u00b2 u +1576u -900c =0\n\nHmm, so this is the same equation as before. So that didn't help much. So maybe need to find another equation.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider equations (2a) and the expression for (24 -v)^2.\n\nFrom equation (2a):\n\n(24 -v)^2 = (676u)/c -u\u00b2.\n\nAlso, from equation (1): v\u00b2 =c u -u\u00b2.\n\nSo perhaps (24 -v)^2 + v\u00b2 can be expressed?\n\nWait, (24 -v)^2 + v\u00b2 = 24\u00b2 -48 v +2v\u00b2,\n\nBut not sure if that helps. Alternatively, since (24 -v)^2 = (676u/c) -u\u00b2,\n\nand v\u00b2 =c u -u\u00b2,\n\nThen perhaps adding these two equations:\n\n(24 -v)^2 + v\u00b2 = (676u/c -u\u00b2) + (c u -u\u00b2) = 676u/c +c u -2u\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but perhaps not useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express v from equation (1):\n\nFrom equation (1): v\u00b2 =c u -u\u00b2,\n\nThus, v = sqrt(c u - u\u00b2). Since y is between 0 and24, and X is inside the rectangle, so this square root is real, so c u -u\u00b2 \u22650, so u(c -u) \u22650, which is true as 0 <u <c.\n\nHmm, but substituting sqrt terms might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variable substitution. Let me denote t = u /c, so that u =tc. Since u is between 0 and c, t is between 0 and1.\n\nSimilarly, let me denote s = v /24, so v=24s, where 0 <s <1.\n\nBut maybe this complicates. Alternatively, let me see if I can find a relation between equations (2a) and (3a).\n\nLooking back at equation 2a and 3a:\n\nEquation 2a: c(S) =676u,\n\nEquation 3a: c(T)=900(c -u),\n\nWhere S =x\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2,\n\nand T=(c -x)^2 + (24 -y)^2,\n\nEarlier, we saw that T = S +c\u00b2 -2c x,\n\nTherefore, equation 3a can be written as c(S +c\u00b2 -2c x)=900(c -x),\n\nBut from equation 2a, cS =676x,\n\nSubstituting into equation3a:\n\n676x +c^3 -2c\u00b2x =900(c -x),\n\nWhich rearranged gives:\n\nc\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x +676x -900c +900x =0,\n\nWhich is the same as before: c\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x +1576x -900c =0,\n\nHmm. Maybe express this equation in terms of x?\n\nFrom equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x,\n\nAlso, from equation (2a): c(x\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2)=676x,\n\nLet me compute x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2:\n\nThat is equal to x\u00b2 + (24\u00b2 -48y + y\u00b2) =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +576 -48y,\n\nFrom equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x,\n\nThus, x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 =c x +576 -48y,\n\nTherefore, equation (2a) becomes:\n\nc*(c x +576 -48y)=676x,\n\n=> c\u00b2 x +576c -48c y =676x,\n\nRearranged:\n\nc\u00b2 x -676x +576c -48c y =0,\n\n=> x(c\u00b2 -676) +c(576 -48 y)=0,\n\nHmm. Let me see if we can also express y in terms of x and c.\n\nFrom equation (1): y\u00b2 =c x -x\u00b2,\n\nSo y= sqrt(c x -x\u00b2). Since y is positive (as inside the rectangle above the x-axis), we can take the positive root.\n\nAlternatively, let me square the previous equation? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let me solve for y from the above equation.\n\nFrom the equation above:\n\nx(c\u00b2 -676) +c(576 -48 y)=0,\n\nLet me express 576 -48y = [ -x(c\u00b2 -676) ] /c,\n\nThus,\n\n576 -48y = -x(c\u00b2 -676)/c,\n\nThen,\n\n48y =576 +x(c\u00b2 -676)/c,\n\nDivide both sides by 48:\n\ny =12 + (x(c\u00b2 -676))/(48c)\n\nHmm. Let me note this as equation (4):\n\ny =12 + [x(c\u00b2 -676)]/(48c)\n\nOkay, so now, since we also have from equation (1): y\u00b2 =c x -x\u00b2,\n\nWe can substitute y from equation (4) into equation (1):\n\n[12 + (x(c\u00b2 -676))/(48c)]\u00b2 = c x -x\u00b2,\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe manageable.\n\nLet me denote term A = x(c\u00b2 -676)/(48c),\n\nThus,\n\n[12 + A]^2 =c x -x\u00b2,\n\nExpanding left side:\n\n12\u00b2 +24A + A\u00b2 =c x -x\u00b2,\n\n=> 144 +24A +A\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -c x =0,\n\nBut equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x,\n\nWait, but perhaps substituting A's expression:\n\nLet me substitute A =x(c\u00b2 -676)/(48c),\n\nThus:\n\n144 +24*(x(c\u00b2 -676)/(48c)) + [x(c\u00b2 -676)/(48c)]\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -c x =0,\n\nThis is going to be very messy, but let's try to simplify term by term.\n\nFirst term:144,\n\nSecond term: 24*(x(c\u00b2 -676))/(48c) = (24/48)*(x(c\u00b2 -676)/c) = (1/2)*(x(c\u00b2 -676)/c),\n\nThird term: [x(c\u00b2 -676)/(48c)]\u00b2,\n\nFourth term:x\u00b2,\n\nFifth term: -c x.\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\n144 + [ (x(c\u00b2 -676))/(2c) ) ] + [ x\u00b2(c\u00b2 -676)^2 )/(48c)^2 ] +x\u00b2 -c x =0.\n\nThis is quite complex. Perhaps there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that c is an integer? Since the problem is likely constructed with integer lengths, given the circumradii 13 and 15, which are integers. Let me think.\n\nGiven that the circumradius for triangle AXD is 13, and for BXC is15, perhaps the sides are multiples such that their product over area gives these radii. Also since 13 and15 are part of Pythagorean triples (5-12-13, 9-12-15, etc.), maybe there's a relation here.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem involves a rectangle and perpendicular angle, maybe coordinate system allows for some symmetry or Pythagorean theorem applications.\n\nWait, another thought: since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, then by the circle with diameter AB, as we noted earlier, so X lies on that circle. Therefore, coordinates of X satisfy x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x.\n\nSo, in triangle AXD, with vertices at (0,0), (x,y), (0,24), which is a triangle with one vertex at the bottom left corner, one at the top left corner, and X somewhere on the circle.\n\nSimilarly for BXC.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry, let me consider that for triangle AXD, its circumradius is 13. The circumradius can also be calculated using coordinates.\n\nThe formula for the circumradius of a triangle with coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) is given by:\n\nR = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ |AB|^2 |AC|^2 |BC|^2 } }{ 4 |\u0394| }\n\nBut maybe another formula: For any triangle with vertices (x_A,y_A), (x_B,y_B), (x_C,y_C), the circumradius can also be found by:\n\nR = \\frac{ | (x_A(y_B - y_C) + x_B(y_C - y_A) + x_C(y_A - y_B)) | }{ 2 \\sqrt{ (a^2 b^2 c^2 - (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)^2 /4 ) } }\n\nHmm, that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using coordinates to find the circumradius.\n\nAlternatively, since triangle AXD has coordinates A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). Let me compute the circumradius using the formula R = \\frac{a}{2 \\sin A}, where a is the side opposite angle A.\n\nIn triangle AXD:\n\nLet me denote the sides:\n\nAX: length sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(c x) from equation (1),\n\nXD: sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2),\n\nAD:24.\n\nLet me pick angle at A: angle at (0,0). The side opposite angle A is XD, so:\n\nR = XD / (2 sin angle A )\n\nSimilarly, angle A is the angle between sides AX and AD. Wait, AD is vertical from A(0,0) to D(0,24), and AX is from A(0,0) to X(x,y). So angle at A between AX and AD.\n\nThe sine of angle at A can be computed as the ratio between the opposite side over hypotenuse in some triangle, but perhaps using coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, the sine of angle at A can be calculated using the cross product:\n\nsin(angle at A) = |(AX vector) \u00d7 (AD vector)| / (|AX| |AD|)\n\nAX vector is (x,y), AD vector is (0,24).\n\nCross product magnitude is x*24 - y*0 =24x,\n\nThus,\n\nsin(angle A)= (24x)/( |AX| |AD| )\n\n|AX|=sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt(c x),\n\n|AD|=24,\n\nThus,\n\nsin(angle A)= (24x)/( sqrt(c x)*24 )= x / sqrt(c x)= sqrt(x/c).\n\nTherefore,\n\nR = XD / (2 * sqrt(x/c) ) = (XD * sqrt(c))/(2 sqrt(x)) )\n\nBut R is given as 13,\n\nThus,\n\n(XD * sqrt(c))/(2 sqrt(x)) ) =13,\n\n=> XD * sqrt(c) =26 sqrt(x),\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nXD\u00b2 * c = 676 x,\n\nBut XD\u00b2 =x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2,\n\nSo,\n\n[ x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ] *c =676x,\n\nWhich is exactly equation (2a). So that checks out. So no new info here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Law of Sines for triangle AXD:\n\nIn triangle AXD,\n\nAX / sin(angle D) = 2R,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nXD / sin(angle A) =2R,\n\nAD / sin(angle X)=2R,\n\nHmm, let me try angle at D.\n\nAngle at D is between sides DX and DA. DA is down from D(0,24) to A(0,0), and DX is from D(0,24) to X(x,y).\n\nThe sine of angle at D can be calculated similarly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using angle X:\n\nIn triangle AXD, angle at X is opposite side AD=24,\n\nThus,\n\nAD/(2R) = sin(angle X),\n\nSo,\n\n24/(2*13)= sin(angle X),\n\nThus,\n\nsin(angle X)=24/26=12/13.\n\nSo angle X in triangle AXD has sine 12/13, so angle X is arcsin(12/13). Since triangle is acute, angle X must be less than 90\u00b0, so that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC, let's see.\n\nCircumradius 15, so:\n\nBC is 24, so applying Law of Sines:\n\nBC/(2*15)=sin(angle at X in triangle BXC).\n\nThus,\n\n24/(30)= sin(angle at X),\n\nThus sin(angle X)= 24/30=4/5,\n\nThus angle at X in triangle BXC is arcsin(4/5), again acute.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is useful?\n\nSo angle at X in AXD is arcsin(12/13), so the angle at X in AXD is greater than that in BXC, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coordinates can be found using trigonometry.\n\nAlternatively, note that in triangle AXD, angle at X is arcsin(12/13), so the coordinates of X must satisfy that the angle between vectors XA and XD is arcsin(12/13). Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables substitution.\n\nLet me let\u2019s consider equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = c x,\n\nEquation (2a): c (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )=676x,\n\nLet me expand equation (2a):\n\nc [x\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 -48y + y\u00b2] =676x,\n\nFrom equation (1), x\u00b2 + y\u00b2= c x,\n\nThus,\n\nc [c x + 576 -48 y ] =676x,\n\nWhich is the same as before. So,\n\nc\u00b2 x +576c -48c y =676x,\n\nLet me rearrange terms to group x terms and constants:\n\n(c\u00b2 -676)x -48c y +576c=0,\n\nHmm, perhaps express y from here:\n\n-48c y = - (c\u00b2 -676)x -576c,\n\nThus,\n\ny = [ (c\u00b2 -676)x +576c ] / (48c),\n\nWhich is the same as equation (4):\n\ny =12 + [x(c\u00b2 -676)]/(48c),\n\nsince 576c /48c =12,\n\nand (c\u00b2 -676)x /48c is the second term.\n\nSo, that's consistent.\n\nSo, then, substituting into equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x,\n\nWe can write y in terms of x and c, then plug into equation (1).\n\nLet me do that.\n\nLet me denote:\n\ny =12 + [x(c\u00b2 -676)]/(48c),\n\nThen y squared is:\n\n[12 + (x(c\u00b2 -676))/(48c)]\u00b2,\n\nExpanding that:\n\n12\u00b2 + 2*12*(x(c\u00b2 -676)/(48c)) + [x(c\u00b2 -676)/(48c)]\u00b2,\n\nWhich is 144 + (24x(c\u00b2 -676))/(48c) + [x\u00b2(c\u00b2 -676)^2]/(48c)^2,\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term:144,\n\nSecond term: (24/48)*(x(c\u00b2 -676)/c)= (0.5)*(x(c\u00b2 -676)/c)= x(c\u00b2 -676)/(2c),\n\nThird term: [x\u00b2 (c\u00b2 -676)^2]/(2304 c\u00b2),\n\nThus,\n\ny\u00b2 =144 + [x(c\u00b2 -676)/(2c)] + [x\u00b2 (c\u00b2 -676)^2]/[2304 c\u00b2].\n\nTherefore, equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x,\n\nSubstituting y\u00b2,\n\nx\u00b2 +144 + [x(c\u00b2 -676)/(2c)] + [x\u00b2 (c\u00b2 -676)^2]/[2304 c\u00b2] =c x.\n\nLet me write all terms on left side:\n\nx\u00b2 +144 + [x(c\u00b2 -676)/(2c)] + [x\u00b2 (c\u00b2 -676)^2]/[2304 c\u00b2] -c x =0.\n\nThis equation is a quartic in x, which seems very complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps assume that AB =c is an integer, and given the circumradii are 13 and15, which are part of Pythagorean triples, maybe c is 25? Since 7-24-25 triangle has a 24 side, but not sure. Alternatively, let me think of possible values.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider equations (2a) and (3a) and see if I can find a relation between them.\n\nEquation (2a): c (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =676x,\n\nEquation (3a): c [ (c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] =900(c -x),\n\nLet me denote term (24 - y)^2 as K,\n\nThen,\n\nEquation (2a): c (x\u00b2 + K)=676x,\n\nEquation (3a):c [ (c -x)^2 + K ] =900(c -x),\n\nLet me subtract equation (2a) from equation (3a):\n\nc[ (c -x)^2 + K -x\u00b2 -K ] =900(c -x) -676x,\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nc[ (c -x)^2 -x\u00b2 ] = right side,\n\nExpand (c -x)^2 -x\u00b2:\n\n= c\u00b2 -2c x +x\u00b2 -x\u00b2 =c\u00b2 -2c x,\n\nThus,\n\nc(c\u00b2 -2c x) =900(c -x) -676x,\n\nExpand left side:\n\nc\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x,\n\nRight side:900c -900x -676x=900c - (900+676)x =900c -1576x,\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\nc\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x =900c -1576x,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nc\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x -900c +1576x=0,\n\nWhich is exactly the equation we had earlier. So no progress.\n\nHmm. Maybe consider that equations (2a) and (3a) can be related via variables u =x and v =24 - y,\n\nLet me try substituting variables:\n\nLet me set u =x,\n\nand v =24 - y,\n\nThen y =24 -v,\n\nSo equation (1):x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x,\n\n=> u\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2 =c u,\n\nEquation (2a):c (u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=676u,\n\nEquation (3a):c [ (c -u)^2 +v\u00b2 ]=900(c -u),\n\nThis substitution may help.\n\nSo now, in terms of u and v:\n\nEquation (1):u\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2 =c u,\n\nEquation (2a):c(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=676u,\n\nEquation (3a):c[ (c -u)^2 +v\u00b2 ] =900(c -u).\n\nLet me see if equations (1) and (2a) can be combined.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nu\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2 =c u,\n\nExpand (24 -v)^2:\n\n24\u00b2 -48v +v\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nu\u00b2 +24\u00b2 -48v +v\u00b2 =c u,\n\n=> (u\u00b2 +v\u00b2) + 576 -48v =c u,\n\nFrom equation (2a): c(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=676u,\n\nSo (u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=676u/c,\n\nSubstitute into above equation:\n\n(676u/c) +576 -48v =c u,\n\nThus,\n\n576 -48v =c u -676u/c,\n\nHmm,\n\nLet me write:\n\n576 -48v =u(c -676/c),\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, let me solve for v from this equation:\n\n48v =576 -u(c -676/c),\n\nThus,\n\nv= [576 -u(c -676/c)] /48,\n\n=12 - [u(c -676/c)] /48,\n\nHmm, maybe substitute into equation (3a).\n\nEquation (3a):c[ (c -u)^2 +v\u00b2 ] =900(c -u),\n\nLet me compute (c -u)^2 +v\u00b2.\n\nFirst, expand (c -u)^2 =c\u00b2 -2c u +u\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n(c -u)^2 +v\u00b2= c\u00b2 -2c u +u\u00b2 +v\u00b2,\n\nFrom equation (2a): u\u00b2 +v\u00b2=676u/c,\n\nSo,\n\n= c\u00b2 -2c u +676u/c,\n\nThus equation (3a) becomes:\n\nc*(c\u00b2 -2c u +676u/c)=900(c -u),\n\nMultiply through:\n\nc\u00b3 -2c\u00b2 u +676u =900(c -u),\n\nWhich is the same equation as before: c\u00b3 -2c\u00b2u +676u -900c +900u=0 \u2192 c\u00b3 -2c\u00b2u +1576u -900c=0,\n\nThus, no progress. Hmm.\n\nMaybe I need to assign numerical values. Let me assume c is an integer. Let me think of possible c such that equations can hold.\n\nGiven that the circumradius for AXD is 13, which is a hypotenuse of 24 and some other sides. Let me see:\n\nIn triangle AXD, AD is 24. The circumradius is 13. So by the formula R = a/(2 sin A), where a is the side opposite angle A.\n\nIf AD is 24, then if angle at X is opposite AD, then:\n\n24/(2 sin angle X)=13 \u2192 sin angle X=24/(2*13)=12/13,\n\nWhich matches what we found earlier. So angle at X in AXD has sine 12/13.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC with circumradius15:\n\n24/(2 sin angle X)=15 \u2192 sin angle X=24/30=4/5,\n\nWhich also matches previous result.\n\nSo angle at X in BXC has sine 4/5.\n\nHmm, so these angles are fixed. Perhaps coordinates can be set such that the triangles have sides related to these sines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinate system with AB= c, and set variables in terms of c.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that equations (2a) and (3a) can be manipulated as follows:\n\nLet me consider equation (2a): c(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)=676x,\n\nand equation (3a): c[(c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2]=900(c -x),\n\nLet me denote equation (2a) as:\n\nc(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)=676x,\n\nequation (3a) as:\n\nc[(c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2]=900(c -x),\n\nLet me subtract equation (2a) from equation (3a):\n\nc[(c -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 -x\u00b2 - (24 - y)^2] =900(c -x) -676x,\n\nSimplify left side:\n\nc[(c -x)^2 -x\u00b2] = right side,\n\nExpand (c -x)^2 -x\u00b2:\n\n= c\u00b2 -2c x,\n\nThus,\n\nc(c\u00b2 -2c x)=900(c -x) -676x,\n\nWhich gives:\n\nc\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x =900c -900x -676x,\n\n\u2192 c\u00b3 -2c\u00b2x -900c +1576x=0,\n\nWhich is the same as earlier, so no progress.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to use equation (1):x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x,\n\nLet me note that in equation (2a), the term (24 - y)^2 can be expressed as:\n\n(24 - y)^2 = (24)^2 -48y +y\u00b2,\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +576 -48y = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) +576 -48y =c x +576 -48y,\n\nTherefore, equation (2a):\n\nc(c x +576 -48y)=676x,\n\nWhich rearranged gives:\n\nc\u00b2x +576c -48c y =676x,\n\n\u2192 c\u00b2x -676x +576c =48c y,\n\n\u2192 y = [c\u00b2x -676x +576c]/(48c),\n\nSimilarly, from equation (1), y\u00b2 =c x -x\u00b2,\n\nSo substituting y:\n\ny\u00b2 = [ (c\u00b2x -676x +576c)^2 ] / (48c)^2 =c x -x\u00b2,\n\nThis equation is quite complex, but maybe if we suppose that c is 25?\n\nLet me try c=25.

So this is another relation.\n\nHmm, but I don't see how to use this yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that AX * XD =26x,\n\nand BX * XC =30(c -x),\n\nLet me consider that AX and XD are sides of triangle AXD,\n\nand BX and XC are sides of triangle BXC.\n\nHmm, perhaps use AM-GM inequality or something, but since they are products.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that:\n\nLet me denote AX = m, XD =n,\n\nSo m*n=26x,\n\nAlso, in triangle AXD, sides are m, n, 24,\n\nThus, by the Law of Cosines:\n\nm\u00b2 +n\u00b2 -2mncos(theta)=24\u00b2,\n\nwhere theta is the angle between AX and XD,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle is acute, all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 >24\u00b2,\n\nSimilarly for the other triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that in triangle AXD,\n\nThe circumradius R=13= (m*n*24)/(4*\u0394),\n\nAnd \u0394=12x,\n\nThus,\n\n13= (24 m n)/(48x),\n\n\u2192 m*n=26x,\n\nWhich is given.\n\nSimilarly for the other triangle.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe think of AX and XD as variables with product 26x, and similarly for BX and XC with product30(c -x).\n\nAdditionally, from triangle AXD,\n\nWe can relate m and n with AD=24,\n\nUsing the Law of Cosines:\n\nm\u00b2 +n\u00b2 - 2mn cos(angle AXD) =24\u00b2,\n\nBut angle AXD is acute.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nThis seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that in triangle AXD,\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2,\n\nSo,\n\nm\u00b2 +n\u00b2 >24\u00b2,\n\nBut m*n=26x,\n\nAlso,\n\n(m -n)^2 \u22650 \u2192m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 \u22652mn=52x,\n\nThus,\n\n26x \u2264 (m\u00b2 +n\u00b2),\n\nSo,\n\n26x \u2264 m\u00b2 +n\u00b2,\n\nBut also,\n\nm\u00b2 +n\u00b2 >576,\n\nThus,\n\n26x < m\u00b2 +n\u00b2,\n\nHmm, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the fact that in triangle AXD,\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) + (x\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2 ) = 2x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2,\n\nBut from equation (1), x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =c x,\n\nThus,\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 =2x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 =2x\u00b2 + (y\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2),\n\nWait, y\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2 = y\u00b2 +576 -48y +y\u00b2=2y\u00b2 -48y +576,\n\nThus,\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2=2x\u00b2 +2y\u00b2 -48y +576,\n\nBut from equation (1), 2y\u00b2=2(c x -x\u00b2),\n\nSo,\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2=2x\u00b2 +2(c x -x\u00b2) -48y +576,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2x\u00b2 +2c x -2x\u00b2 -48y +576=2c x -48y +576,\n\nThus,\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2=2c x -48y +576,\n\nBut from triangle AXD, AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 >AD\u00b2=576,\n\nThus,\n\n2c x -48y +576>576 \u21922c x -48y>0 \u2192c x>24 y,\n\nHmm, which is another relation: c x >24 y,\n\nSimilarly from equation (1): y\u00b2 =c x -x\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nc x =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 >24 y,\n\n\u2192x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -24 y >0,\n\n\u2192x\u00b2 + (y -12)^2 -144 >0,\n\n\u2192x\u00b2 + (y -12)^2 >144,\n\nSo the point (x,y) lies outside a circle of radius12 centered at (0,12),\n\nBut since X is inside the rectangle, which has width c and height24, so coordinates are between0 and c,0 and24.\n\nSimilarly for the other triangle BXC:\n\nBX * XC =30(c -x),\n\nand similarly BX\u00b2 + XC\u00b2 >24\u00b2,\n\nand other conditions.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that equations (2a) and (3a) can be written in terms of variables.\n\nLet me denote u =x,\n\nand v =24 -y,\n\nThen, y=24 -v,\n\nEquation (1):x\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2 =c x,\n\nEquation (2a):c(x\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=676x,\n\nEquation (3a):c[ (c -x)^2 +v\u00b2 ]=900(c -x),\n\nNow, the variables are u=x and v=24 -y,\n\nSo equations become:\n\n1) x\u00b2 +v\u00b2 =c x,\n\n2) c(x\u00b2 +v\u00b2) =676x,\n\n3) c[ (c -x)^2 +v\u00b2 ] =900(c -x),\n\nFrom equation (1), x\u00b2 +v\u00b2 =c x,\n\nThus, equation (2) becomes c*(c x)=676x \u2192c\u00b2 x =676x,\n\nAssuming x \u22600,\n\nThus,\n\nc\u00b2 =676,\n\n\u2192c=26,\n\nSince c is length, positive.\n\nAh! Here we go! That's the key.\n\nSo from equation (2a):\n\nc*(x\u00b2 +v\u00b2)=676x,\n\nBut x\u00b2 +v\u00b2 =c x (from equation1),\n\nThus,\n\nc*(c x)=676x \u2192 c\u00b2 x=676x,\n\nIf x\u22600,\n\nthen c\u00b2=676 \u2192c=26.\n\nThus, c=26.\n\nWait, but earlier when I tried c=26, it didn't work? Let me check again.\n\nWait, so according to this, c must be 26. Let's see why earlier calculation didn't work.\n\nWhen I set c=26, and used equations, I found y=12, leading to x=18 or8, but then equation (3a) didn't hold.\n\nWait, perhaps made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait let me redo with c=26.\n\nGiven c=26,\n\nEquation (1):x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=26x,\n\nEquation (2a):26*(x\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2)=676x,\n\nDivide both sides by26:\n\nx\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2=26x,\n\nBut from (1):x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=26x,\n\nSubtract (1) from equation (2a):\n\n(24 -y)^2 -y\u00b2=26x -26x,\n\n\u2192576 -48y=0 \u2192 y=12.\n\nThus y=12.\n\nThen equation (1) gives x\u00b2 +144=26x \u2192x\u00b2 -26x +144=0,\n\nSolutions:\n\nx=(26 \u00b1\u221a(26\u00b2-4*144))/2,\n\n= (26 \u00b1\u221a(676-576))/2,\n\n= (26 \u00b1\u221a100)/2,\n\n= (26\u00b110)/2,\n\n\u2192x= (36)/2=18 or x=(16)/2=8.\n\nNow check equation (3a):\n\nc=26,\n\nEquation (3a):26*[ (26 -x)^2 + (24 -12)^2 ] =900*(26 -x),\n\nCompute left side:\n\n26*[ (26 -x)^2 +12\u00b2 ] =26*( (26 -x)^2 +144 ),\n\nRight side:900*(26 -x),\n\nLet me test x=18:\n\nLeft side:26*[ (8)^2 +144 ] =26*(64+144)=26*208=5408,\n\nRight side:900*8=7200,\n\n5408 vs7200: Not equal.\n\nNow x=8:\n\nLeft side:26*[ (18)^2 +144 ]=26*(324+144)=26*468=12168,\n\nRight side:900*(18)=16200,\n\n12168 vs16200: Not equal.\n\nHmm, discrepancy. So this suggests inconsistency. But according to equations (1) and (2a), c must be26, but then equation (3a) is not satisfied.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the length of AB in a rectangle ABCD where BC is 24. There's a point X inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, and their circumradii are 13 and 15 respectively. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD and BC = AD = 24. We need to find AB, which is the same as CD. Let me try to visualize the rectangle. Let me draw it mentally: Let's say A is at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, AB is the base, BC is the vertical side of length 24. So, coordinates might help here. Maybe assigning coordinates to each point?\n\nYes, coordinate geometry might be the way to go. Let me set coordinate system with point A at (0,0). Then, since AB is the horizontal side, B would be at (AB, 0). Since BC is 24, point C would be at (AB, 24), and point D at (0,24). Then point X is somewhere inside the rectangle. Let me denote the coordinates of X as (x,y). \n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90 degrees. So vectors AX and BX should be perpendicular. Let me write that down. The vector from A to X is (x,y) and from B to X is (x - AB, y). Their dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular. So:\n\nx*(x - AB) + y*y = 0\n\nThat's one equation.\n\nNow, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. Hmm, their circumradii are 13 and 15. So, for triangle AXD, the circumradius is 13, and for triangle BXC, it's 15. \n\nRecall that the formula for the circumradius of a triangle with sides a, b, c is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area. Alternatively, for a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. But wait, the triangles here are not necessarily right-angled, since they are both acute. So maybe I can use the general formula?\n\nAlternatively, since triangles are acute, their circumradius formulas still apply. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use coordinates to write equations for circumradius?\n\nAlternatively, maybe first, let me note that since angle AXB is 90 degrees, triangle AXB is right-angled at X. Wait, but the problem says angle AXB is 90 degrees, so triangle AXB is right-angled at X. But then, that triangle's circumradius would be half the hypotenuse AB. Wait, but is that triangle AXB considered here?\n\nWait, the problem states that triangles AXD and BXC are acute, but it doesn't mention triangle AXB. Since angle AXB is 90 degrees, triangle AXB is right, not acute. But that's okay, since the problem only requires AXD and BXC to be acute. So that's fine.\n\nSo, moving on. Let me first write down coordinates for all points. Let me formalize this:\n\nLet me let AB = L (since that's the length we need to find). So, coordinates:\n\nA = (0,0)\nB = (L,0)\nC = (L,24)\nD = (0,24)\nX = (x,y), where 0 < x < L and 0 < y <24.\n\nGiven angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so as above:\n\nThe vectors AX = (x,y) and BX = (x - L, y) are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:\n\nx(x - L) + y^2 = 0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 - L x + y\u00b2 = 0. Equation (1).\n\nNow, triangles AXD and BXC have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively.\n\nFirst, let's consider triangle AXD. Its vertices are A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). Let me compute the sides of this triangle.\n\nCompute the lengths:\n\nAX: distance from A to X: \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\nXD: distance from X to D: \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)\nAD: distance from A to D: 24 (since it's the side of the rectangle, but actually AD is vertical from (0,0) to (0,24))\n\nWait, triangle AXD's sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, AD is 24, but is that part of the triangle? Let's see: Triangle AXD connects points A, X, D. So sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, AD is a side of the rectangle, but in the triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, but AD is between A and D, so yes, the triangle has sides AX, XD, and AD. Wait, but AD is fixed as 24, so that's one side.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC: points B(L,0), X(x,y), C(L,24). Its sides are BX, XC, and BC (which is 24). Wait, but BC is between B and C, so in triangle BXC, the sides are BX, XC, and BC (24).\n\nTherefore, for triangle AXD, sides are:\n\nAX: \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nXD: \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nAD: 24.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC, sides are:\n\nBX: \u221a( (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC: \u221a( (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nBC: 24.\n\nSo, the circumradius for triangle AXD is 13, so using the formula for circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n\nAlternatively, since AD is a side of the triangle AXD, which is 24, but since triangle is acute, maybe we can use other properties?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates to compute the circumradius. Let me recall that the circumradius can be found by the formula for coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let's denote for triangle AXD.\n\nLet me denote sides:\n\nLet me denote sides as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let a = XD, b = AD =24, c = AX.\n\nWait, but in the formula, R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394). So, to compute R, I need the lengths of all three sides and the area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates, the circumradius can be calculated by finding the circumcircle equation and then computing its radius.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to use coordinates to write equations for the circumradius.\n\nLet me first work on triangle AXD.\n\nPoints A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24).\n\nFirst, let's compute the sides:\n\nAX: \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nXD: \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nAD: 24.\n\nThe area \u0394 of triangle AXD can be computed using coordinates.\n\nThe area is (1/2)*base*height. Since AD is vertical from (0,0) to (0,24), the base is AD (24 units), and the height is the horizontal distance from X to the line AD (which is the y-axis). The horizontal distance from X(x,y) to AD is just x. Therefore, area is (1/2)*24*x = 12x.\n\nAlternatively, using determinant formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)| (x*(24 - 0) + 0*(y - 24) + 0*(0 - y) | = (1/2)|24x| = 12x. Same result.\n\nSo \u0394_AXD = 12x.\n\nTherefore, the circumradius R1 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4*\u0394_AXD) = (AX * XD * 24)/(4*12x) = (AX * XD *24)/(48x) = (AX * XD)/(2x)\n\nGiven that R1 is 13, so:\n\n(AX * XD) / (2x) = 13 \u21d2 AX * XD = 26x. Equation (2).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute AX and XD in terms of coordinates.\n\nAX = \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nXD = \u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nTherefore, AX * XD = \u221a[x\u00b2 + y\u00b2] * \u221a[x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2]\n\nSo Equation (2) becomes:\n\n\u221a[(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)] = 26x\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated. Maybe square both sides to eliminate the square roots?\n\nYes, let's square both sides:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = (26x)^2 = 676x\u00b2. Equation (2a).\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC with circumradius 15.\n\nLet me do the same steps for triangle BXC.\n\nPoints B(L,0), X(x,y), C(L,24).\n\nSides:\n\nBX: \u221a[(x - L)^2 + y\u00b2]\n\nXC: \u221a[(x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2]\n\nBC: 24.\n\nArea \u0394_BXC: Since BC is vertical from (L,0) to (L,24), the base is BC (24 units), and the height is the horizontal distance from X to the line BC (which is x - L). Since X is inside the rectangle, the horizontal distance is |x - L|. Since X is between 0 and L, this would be L - x. But since area is absolute, it's (1/2)*24*(L - x) = 12*(L - x).\n\nTherefore, area \u0394_BXC = 12*(L - x).\n\nCircumradius R2 = (BX * XC * BC)/(4*\u0394_BXC) = (BX * XC *24)/(4*12*(L - x)) ) = (BX * XC *24)/(48*(L - x)) ) = (BX * XC)/(2*(L - x)) \n\nGiven that R2 =15, so:\n\n(BX * XC)/(2*(L - x)) =15 \u21d2 BX * XC =30*(L -x). Equation (3).\n\nSimilarly, compute BX and XC:\n\nBX = \u221a[(x - L)^2 + y\u00b2]\n\nXC = \u221a[(x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2]\n\nTherefore, their product is \u221a[( (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 )*( (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ]\n\nSo Equation (3) becomes:\n\n\u221a[ ( (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 )*( (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] = 30*(L - x)\n\nAgain, square both sides:\n\n[ ( (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 )*( (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] = 900*(L -x)^2. Equation (3a).\n\nNow, so far, we have Equations (1), (2a), and (3a), and variables are x, y, and L (since AB = L is the one we need to find). So three equations with three variables. It might be complex, but maybe we can find some substitutions.\n\nLet me recall Equation (1): x\u00b2 - L x + y\u00b2 = 0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = L x. That's interesting because AX squared is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, so AX^2 = Lx \u21d2 AX = \u221a(Lx). \n\nSimilarly, in Equation (2a):\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = 676x\u00b2\n\nBut since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = Lx, substitute into first term:\n\n(Lx)*(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = 676x\u00b2\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = (676x\u00b2)/(Lx) )= 676x / L\n\nWait, let me do that step again:\n\nLeft side: (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)*(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = Lx * (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = 676x\u00b2\n\nTherefore,\n\nx\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = (676x\u00b2)/(Lx) = 676x / L\n\nWait, that is:\n\nLx * [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2] = 676x\u00b2 \u21d2 divide both sides by x (assuming x \u22600, which it must be since otherwise the area of AXD would be zero, which can't have a circumradius):\n\nL [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2] = 676x \u21d2 \n\nHmm, okay. Let me note that.\n\nSimilarly, perhaps for Equation (3a):\n\nLet me see. Let me denote (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 as part of it. Let me see if I can use Equation (1) here as well.\n\nWait, from Equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = Lx \u21d2 (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - 2Lx + L\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -2Lx + L\u00b2 = Lx -2Lx + L\u00b2 = -Lx + L\u00b2 = L(L -x )\n\nSimilarly, (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2. Let me compute that:\n\n(x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = [ (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 ] + (24 - y)^2 - y\u00b2. Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps express it in terms of previous terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote term1 = (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 = L(L -x ) from above.\n\nterm2 = (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = term1 + (24 - y)^2 - y\u00b2. Wait, but maybe express term2 in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider term1 * term2 is the left side of Equation (3a):\n\nterm1 * term2 = [ (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 ]*[ (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ]\n\n= [ term1 ] * [ term1 + (24 - y)^2 - y\u00b2 ]\n\nWait, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, let me note that term1 = L(L - x), so let me use that.\n\nSo term1 = L(L - x)\n\nterm2 = (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = ( (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 ) + (24 - y)^2 - y\u00b2 = term1 + (24)^2 - 48y + y\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = term1 + 576 -48y. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, (24 - y)^2 = 24\u00b2 -48y + y\u00b2, so:\n\nterm2 = (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 - y\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ?\n\nWait, no, perhaps another approach:\n\nterm2 = (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 + (24)^2 - 48y\n\nWait, that's (x-L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = (x-L)^2 + y\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 -48y\n\nBut (x-L)^2 + y\u00b2 = term1 = L(L -x )\n\nTherefore:\n\nterm2 = term1 + 24\u00b2 -48y = L(L -x) + 576 -48y\n\nThus,\n\nterm1 * term2 = L(L -x) * [ L(L -x) + 576 -48y ]\n\nSo Equation (3a) is:\n\nterm1 * term2 = [ L(L -x) ] * [ L(L -x) + 576 -48y ] = 900*(L -x)^2\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since we have expressions for AX and BX in terms of L and x, maybe we can find coordinates relationships?\n\nAlternatively, let me note that in triangle AXD, since we have AX, XD, AD, and the circumradius, maybe we can also use the formula for circumradius in terms of sides and angles?\n\nWait, the circumradius R = a/(2 sin A), where a is a side and A is the opposite angle. Since triangle AXD is acute, all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so sines are positive. Maybe that's an approach?\n\nAlternatively, let me see:\n\nIn triangle AXD, let me denote angle at A: angle at A between AX and AD. Let me call that angle \u03b8. Then, the circumradius R is related by the formula:\n\nAD/(2 sin \u03b8) = R ?\n\nWait, let me recall the formula properly. For any triangle, the circumradius R = a/(2 sin A), where a is the side opposite angle A.\n\nIn triangle AXD, side AD is opposite angle at X. Wait, let me be precise.\n\nIn triangle AXD:\n\n- The vertices are A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24)\n\n- The sides:\n\nAX: opposite angle D\n\nXD: opposite angle A\n\nAD: opposite angle X\n\nWait, so AD is opposite angle X. Therefore, the formula would be:\n\nAD/(2 sin(angle at X)) = R\n\nBut angle at X in triangle AXD is angle AXD. Since triangle is acute, angle AXD <90\u00b0, so sin(angle AXD)=something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps proceed with the equations we have.\n\nLet me see if I can find expressions for y in terms of x and L, using Equation (1):\n\nFrom Equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = Lx \u21d2 y\u00b2 = Lx -x\u00b2 \u21d2 y = sqrt(Lx -x\u00b2). Since y is between 0 and 24, that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express y in terms of x and L, then plug into other equations. But that might lead to very complicated expressions. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me see Equation (2a):\n\n(Lx)*(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = 676x\u00b2\n\nWe can write x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 as [x\u00b2 + y\u00b2] + [ (24)^2 -48y ]\n\nWait, x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -48y + 576\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = Lx, so substitute:\n\n= Lx -48y +576\n\nTherefore, Equation (2a) becomes:\n\nLx*( Lx -48y +576 ) = 676x\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by x (assuming x \u22600):\n\nL*( Lx -48y +576 ) = 676x \u21d2 \n\nL\u00b2 x -48 L y + 576 L = 676 x\n\nHmm, that's Equation (2b).\n\nSimilarly, for Equation (3a):\n\nLet me try to do similar substitution.\n\nFirst, in Equation (3a):\n\n[ (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 ] * [ (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] = 900(L -x)^2\n\nEarlier we found that (x - L)^2 + y\u00b2 = L(L - x )\n\nLet me denote term1 = L(L -x )\n\nterm2 = (x - L)^2 + (24 - y)^2\n\nSo term1 * term2 = 900(L -x)^2\n\nWe can write term2 as term1 + (24 - y)^2 - y\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, let me compute term2:\n\nterm2 = (x-L)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = (x-L)^2 + y\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 -48y\n\nBut (x-L)^2 + y\u00b2 = term1 = L(L -x )\n\nThus term2 = L(L -x ) + 576 -48y\n\nSo term1 * term2 = L(L -x ) [ L(L -x ) + 576 -48y ] = 900 (L -x )\u00b2\n\nLet me set z = L -x to simplify. Let z = L -x. Since x is between 0 and L, z is between 0 and L.\n\nSo, substituting z = L -x,\n\nterm1 = L z\n\nterm2 = L z + 576 -48y\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nL z [ L z + 576 -48y ] = 900 z\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by z (assuming z \u22600, which is true since x <L):\n\nL [ L z + 576 -48y ] = 900 z\n\nSubstitute back z = L -x:\n\nL [ L(L -x ) +576 -48y ] = 900 (L -x )\n\nExpand inside the brackets:\n\nL\u00b2 (L -x ) +576 L -48 L y = 900 (L -x )\n\nHmm, this is Equation (3b).\n\nNow, let's see Equations (2b) and (3b):\n\nEquation (2b):\n\nL\u00b2 x -48 L y + 576 L = 676 x\n\nEquation (3b):\n\nL\u00b2 (L -x ) +576 L -48 L y = 900 (L -x )\n\nHmm, perhaps we can combine these equations. Let me write them out again.\n\nEquation (2b):\n\nL\u00b2 x -48 L y +576 L = 676x \u21d2 (L\u00b2 -676)x -48 L y +576 L =0\n\nEquation (3b):\n\nL\u00b2(L -x) +576 L -48 L y =900(L -x )\n\nLet me rearrange terms in Equation (3b):\n\nLeft side: L\u00b3 - L\u00b2 x +576 L -48 L y\n\nRight side: 900 L -900x\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nL\u00b3 - L\u00b2 x +576 L -48 L y -900 L +900x =0 \u21d2\n\nL\u00b3 - L\u00b2 x - 324 L -48 L y +900x =0 \u21d2\n\nL\u00b3 - (L\u00b2 -900)x - 324 L -48 L y =0. Hmm, not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps subtract Equation (2b) * something from Equation (3b) to eliminate terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if we can express y from Equation (2b) and substitute into Equation (3b).\n\nFrom Equation (2b):\n\n(L\u00b2 -676)x -48 L y +576 L =0 \u21d2\n\nLet me solve for y:\n\n-48 L y = - (L\u00b2 -676)x -576 L \u21d2\n\ny = [ (L\u00b2 -676)x +576 L ] / (48 L )\n\nSimilarly, substitute this expression for y into Equation (3b):\n\nEquation (3b):\n\nL\u00b2 (L -x ) +576 L -48 L y =900 (L -x )\n\nSubstitute y:\n\nL\u00b2(L -x) +576 L -48 L * [ (L\u00b2 -676)x +576 L ) / (48 L ) ] = 900(L -x )\n\nSimplify term with y:\n\n48 L * [ ... ] / (48 L ) = [ (L\u00b2 -676)x +576 L ]\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nL\u00b2(L -x) +576 L - [ (L\u00b2 -676)x +576 L ] =900(L -x )\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nL\u00b3 - L\u00b2 x +576 L - (L\u00b2 -676)x -576 L =900(L -x )\n\nSimplify:\n\nL\u00b3 - L\u00b2x +576 L - L\u00b2x +676x -576 L =900(L -x )\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nL\u00b3 -2 L\u00b2 x +676x =900(L -x )\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nL\u00b3 -2 L\u00b2 x +676x -900L +900x =0 \u21d2\n\nL\u00b3 -2 L\u00b2 x + (676x +900x) -900L =0 \u21d2\n\nL\u00b3 -2 L\u00b2 x +1576x -900L =0\n\nFactor terms with x:\n\nL\u00b3 -900L + x(-2 L\u00b2 +1576)=0 \u21d2\n\nHmm, so:\n\nx*(-2 L\u00b2 +1576) = -L\u00b3 +900 L \u21d2\n\nx = [ -L\u00b3 +900 L ] / [ -2 L\u00b2 +1576 ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: -L(L\u00b2 -900)\n\nDenominator: -2(L\u00b2 - 1576/2 ) = -2(L\u00b2 - 788 )\n\nWait:\n\nWait, denominator: -2L\u00b2 +1576 = -2(L\u00b2 - 788 )\n\nSo,\n\nx = [ -L(L\u00b2 - 900) ] / [ -2(L\u00b2 - 788) ) ] = [ L(L\u00b2 -900) ] / [ 2(L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nThus,\n\nx = [ L(L\u00b2 -900) ] / [ 2(L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nHmm, so that's an expression for x in terms of L. Let me note this as Equation (4).\n\nNow, perhaps we can also find another expression for x from Equation (1). Recall that Equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = Lx. So if I can express y in terms of L and x, then plug into this equation?\n\nWait, from Equation (2b) we have an expression for y in terms of L and x.\n\nYes, let's recall:\n\nFrom Equation (2b), we had:\n\ny = [ (L\u00b2 -676)x +576 L ] / (48 L )\n\nSo, substitute this into Equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = Lx\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + [ ( (L\u00b2 -676)x +576 L ) / (48 L ) ]\u00b2 = Lx\n\nThis would give an equation in terms of x and L. Then, using Equation (4) which expresses x in terms of L, we can substitute that into this equation, resulting in an equation purely in L, which we can solve. This seems possible but algebraically intensive. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write y as:\n\ny = [ (L\u00b2 -676)x +576 L ] / (48 L ) = [ (L\u00b2 -676)/48L ) x + 576 L / (48 L ) ]\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n576 L / (48 L ) = 12\n\nSimilarly, (L\u00b2 -676)/ (48 L ) is just that term.\n\nThus, y = [ (L\u00b2 -676)x ]/(48 L ) + 12\n\nSo, y = ( (L\u00b2 -676)/ (48 L ) ) x +12\n\nTherefore, substituting into Equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + [ ( (L\u00b2 -676)/ (48 L ) x +12 ) ]\u00b2 = Lx.\n\nLet me denote for simplicity:\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote K = (L\u00b2 -676)/(48 L ), so y = K x +12. Then,\n\nEquation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + (Kx +12)^2 = Lx\n\nExpand (Kx +12)^2:\n\nK\u00b2 x\u00b2 +24 K x +144\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + K\u00b2 x\u00b2 +24 K x +144 = Lx \u21d2\n\n(1 + K\u00b2) x\u00b2 + (24 K - L ) x +144 =0.\n\nNow, substitute K = (L\u00b2 -676)/(48 L )\n\nTherefore,\n\nK\u00b2 = [ (L\u00b2 -676)^2 ] / (48 L )\u00b2 = (L\u00b2 -676)^2 / (2304 L\u00b2 )\n\nThus,\n\n1 + K\u00b2 = 1 + (L\u00b2 -676)^2 / (2304 L\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly,\n\n24 K - L =24*( (L\u00b2 -676)/(48 L ) ) - L = (24/(48 L ))(L\u00b2 -676) - L = ( (L\u00b2 -676)/(2 L ) ) - L = (L\u00b2 -676 - 2 L\u00b2 ) / (2 L ) = ( - L\u00b2 -676 ) / (2 L )\n\nSo putting all into equation:\n\n[ (1 + (L\u00b2 -676)^2 / (2304 L\u00b2 )) ] x\u00b2 + [ (- L\u00b2 -676 )/(2 L ) ] x +144 =0\n\nThis is getting really complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the expression for x from Equation (4):\n\nx = [ L(L\u00b2 -900) ] / [ 2(L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nLet me substitute this into the above equation. That would give an equation purely in L, which can be solved.\n\nLet me denote x = [ L(L\u00b2 -900) ] / [ 2(L\u00b2 -788) ] as per Equation (4).\n\nTherefore, substitute this x into Equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = Lx\n\nBut since y is expressed in terms of x and L, perhaps better to use the expression in terms of K.\n\nAlternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write x in terms of L:\n\nx = [ L (L\u00b2 - 900) ] / [ 2(L\u00b2 - 788) ]\n\nLet me compute x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = [ L\u00b2 (L\u00b2 -900)^2 ] / [4(L\u00b2 -788)^2 ]\n\nSimilarly, y is given by:\n\ny = [ (L\u00b2 -676)x +576 L ] / (48 L )\n\nSubstituting x:\n\ny = [ (L\u00b2 -676)* [ L (L\u00b2 -900) / (2(L\u00b2 -788)) ] +576 L ] / (48 L )\n\nLet me compute numerator step by step:\n\nFirst term: (L\u00b2 -676)* L (L\u00b2 -900)/(2(L\u00b2 -788))\n\nSecond term: +576 L\n\nSo numerator:\n\n= [ (L\u00b2 -676)L(L\u00b2 -900) + 1152 L (L\u00b2 -788) ] / [2(L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nWait, to combine terms, the second term 576 L is multiplied by 2(L\u00b2 -788)/2(L\u00b2 -788) to have common denominator:\n\nThus,\n\nNumerator becomes:\n\n(L\u00b2 -676)L(L\u00b2 -900) + 576 L * 2 (L\u00b2 -788) all over 2(L\u00b2 -788)\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, actually:\n\nThe first term is (L\u00b2 -676)*L*(L\u00b2 -900)/(2(L\u00b2 -788)), the second term is 576 L.\n\nTo combine them, common denominator is 2(L\u00b2 -788):\n\nThus:\n\nFirst term numerator: (L\u00b2 -676)*L*(L\u00b2 -900)\n\nSecond term numerator: 576 L * 2(L\u00b2 -788)\n\nTherefore, total numerator:\n\n(L\u00b2 -676)L(L\u00b2 -900) + 1152 L (L\u00b2 -788)\n\nThen divided by 2(L\u00b2 -788)\n\nSo overall, y is:\n\n[ (L\u00b2 -676)L(L\u00b2 -900) + 1152 L (L\u00b2 -788) ] / [2(L\u00b2 -788) *48 L ]\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n2(L\u00b2 -788)*48 L = 96 L (L\u00b2 -788 )\n\nSo,\n\ny = [ L { (L\u00b2 -676)(L\u00b2 -900) + 1152 (L\u00b2 -788) } ] / [96 L (L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nCancel L:\n\ny = [ (L\u00b2 -676)(L\u00b2 -900) + 1152(L\u00b2 -788) ] / [96 (L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nThis expression is quite complex, but let me compute the numerator:\n\nLet me expand (L\u00b2 -676)(L\u00b2 -900):\n\n= L^4 -900 L\u00b2 -676 L\u00b2 + 676*900\n\n= L^4 - (900+676)L\u00b2 + 608400\n\n= L^4 -1576 L\u00b2 +608400\n\nThen adding 1152(L\u00b2 -788):\n\n= 1152 L\u00b2 -1152*788\n\n= 1152 L\u00b2 - 908,  let me compute 1152*788. Hmm, 1152*700=806,400; 1152*88=101,376. So total 806,400 +101,376 = 907,776. So 1152*788 = 907,776. Therefore,\n\nTotal numerator expression:\n\n(L^4 -1576 L\u00b2 +608400 ) + (1152 L\u00b2 -907,776 )\n\n= L^4 + (-1576 +1152)L\u00b2 + (608400 -907776 )\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\n-1576 +1152 = -424\n\n608400 -907776 = -299,376\n\nThus numerator is:\n\nL^4 -424 L\u00b2 -299376\n\nTherefore, y becomes:\n\ny = [ L^4 -424 L\u00b2 -299376 ] / [96 (L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nHmm, so now, we can plug x and y back into Equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = Lx ?\n\nWait, but Equation (1) is already used to get here, so perhaps this is not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps there is another equation we can use with the expressions for x and y?\n\nAlternatively, since we have expressions for x in terms of L, perhaps plug into Equation (3b) or another equation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that this problem might require some clever substitutions or noticing that L is integer? Since the problem is asking for AB, which is a length in a rectangle with BC=24, and the circumradii are integers 13 and 15, maybe AB is an integer as well. Perhaps trying to find L as an integer.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can factor the numerator in y's expression:\n\nThe numerator for y is L^4 -424 L\u00b2 -299,376.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor as quadratic in L\u00b2:\n\nLet me denote M = L\u00b2, so:\n\nM\u00b2 -424 M -299,376 =0 ?\n\nWait, but numerator is L^4 -424 L\u00b2 -299376. So, yes, setting M = L\u00b2,\n\nM\u00b2 -424 M -299,376 =0.\n\nLet me see if this quadratic equation can be factored or solved.\n\nCompute discriminant D = (424)^2 +4*299,376\n\nCompute 424 squared: 400\u00b2=160,000; 24\u00b2=576; 2*400*24=19,200. So (400+24)^2=400\u00b2 +2*400*24 +24\u00b2 = 160,000 +19,200 +576=179,776.\n\nThus discriminant D =179,776 +4*299,376\n\nCompute 4*299,376=1,197,504\n\nThus D=179,776 +1,197,504 = 1,377,280\n\nHmm, sqrt(D)=sqrt(1,377,280). Let me see if it's a perfect square.\n\nLet me divide by 16: 1,377,280 /16=86,080. Hmm, 86,080. Not sure. Maybe another factor?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, actually, the numerator for y is L^4 -424 L\u00b2 -299,376, so the equation M\u00b2 -424 M -299,376 =0.\n\nWait, perhaps trying to factor:\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a*b= -299,376 and a + b= -424?\n\nHmm, but since product is negative, one positive and one negative. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, compute the roots via quadratic formula:\n\nM = [424 \u00b1\u221a(424\u00b2 +4*299376)] /2\n\nWait, as above, sqrt(D)= sqrt(179,776 + 1,197,504)= sqrt(1,377,280). Let me see:\n\nsqrt(1,377,280). Let me see 1174 squared is 1,378,276 (since 1000^2=1,000,000; 1100^2=1,210,000; 1170\u00b2=1,368,900; 1174\u00b2= (1170+4)^2=1170\u00b2 + 8*1170 +16=1,368,900 +9,360 +16=1,378,276. So sqrt(1,377,280) is between 1174 and 1173.\n\nWait, 1173\u00b2 = (1174 -1)^2=1174\u00b2 -2*1174 +1=1,378,276 -2348 +1=1,375,929. So 1,375,929 vs D=1,377,280. The difference is 1,377,280 -1,375,929=1,351. Not a perfect square. Hmm, so maybe this approach isn't fruitful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a better way to tackle the problem.\n\nLet me think again. Let me go back to the coordinate system.\n\nWe have rectangle ABCD with AB = L, BC=24. Point X(x,y) inside with angle AXB=90\u00b0, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = L x - y\u00b2? Wait no, equation was x(x-L) + y\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 - Lx + y\u00b2=0 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = Lx. So that's correct.\n\nTriangles AXD and BXC have circumradii 13 and 15. Let me consider triangle AXD first.\n\nWe had for triangle AXD:\n\nCircumradius R1 = 13 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4\u0394_AXD)\n\nAX = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(Lx) from above.\n\nXD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nAD =24.\n\n\u0394_AXD = 12x.\n\nSo,\n\n13 = [ sqrt(Lx) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) *24 ] / (4 *12x )\n\nSimplify denominator:4*12x=48x\n\nNumerator:24 sqrt(Lx) sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nThus,\n\n13 = [24 sqrt(Lx) sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / (48x )\n\nSimplify 24/48 =1/2, so:\n\n13 = [ sqrt(Lx) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / (2x )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2x:\n\n26x = sqrt(Lx) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n676x\u00b2 = Lx (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nWhich is the same as Equation (2a). So that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nLet me think if there is a better substitution.\n\nLet me recall that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so X lies on the circle with diameter AB. Wait, since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, the locus of points X such that angle AXB is 90\u00b0 is the circle with diameter AB. So, point X is on that circle. But since X is inside the rectangle, part of that circle inside the rectangle.\n\nBut AB has length L, so the circle with diameter AB has radius L/2, center at (L/2,0). Wait, but the rectangle extends up to y=24, so X must be on that circle within the rectangle.\n\nHmm, but perhaps this gives another equation?\n\nWait, the coordinates of X must satisfy (x - L/2)^2 + y^2 = (L/2)^2.\n\nExpanding: x\u00b2 - Lx + (L\u00b2)/4 + y\u00b2 = L\u00b2/4 \u21d2 x\u00b2 - Lx + y\u00b2 =0, which is exactly Equation (1). So that's consistent.\n\nThus, that's the same as before.\n\nHmm, so perhaps parametrizing the circle?\n\nLet me parametrize point X on the circle with diameter AB. Let me set parameter \u03b8, angle from the x-axis.\n\nBut coordinates on the circle would be ( (L/2) + (L/2 cos\u03b8), 0 + (L/2 sin\u03b8) )\n\nWait, since the center is at (L/2,0), radius L/2.\n\nThus, parametrization:\n\nx = (L/2)(1 + cos\u03b8)\n\ny = (L/2) sin\u03b8\n\nSince the circle equation is (x - L/2)^2 + y\u00b2 = (L/2)^2.\n\nThis parametrization might help. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set:\n\nx = (L/2)(1 + cos\u03b8)\n\ny = (L/2) sin\u03b8\n\nThen, since X is inside the rectangle, y must be between 0 and24, so sin\u03b8 must be between 0 and 48/L (since y = (L/2) sin\u03b8 <24 \u21d2 sin\u03b8 < 48/L )\n\nAlso, \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0, since X is inside the rectangle (above the x-axis, so y positive).\n\nNow, with this parametrization, maybe we can express variables in terms of L and \u03b8, then use the conditions on the triangles AXD and BXC.\n\nLet me proceed.\n\nFirst, express coordinates:\n\nx = (L/2)(1 + cos\u03b8)\n\ny = (L/2) sin\u03b8\n\nNow, let's compute the sides and circumradius for triangle AXD.\n\nFirst, compute AX, XD, AD.\n\nAX is the distance from A(0,0) to X(x,y):\n\nAX = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt( [ (L/2)^2 (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 + (L/2 sin\u03b8)^2 ] )\n\n= (L/2) sqrt( (1 + 2 cos\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nSimplify inside sqrt:\n\n1 + 2 cos\u03b8 + (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = 1 +2 cos\u03b8 +1 =2 + 2 cos\u03b8 = 2(1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nThus, AX = (L/2) * sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8) ) = (L/2) * sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nRecall that 1 + cos\u03b8 = 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2), so sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8)) = sqrt(4 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) )= 2|cos(\u03b8/2)|. Since \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0, cos(\u03b8/2) is non-negative, so:\n\nAX = (L/2)*2 cos(\u03b8/2) = L cos(\u03b8/2 )\n\nSimilarly, XD is the distance from X to D(0,24):\n\nXD = sqrt( x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nPlugging in x and y:\n\n= sqrt( [ (L/2 (1 + cos\u03b8 ))^2 + (24 - (L/2 sin\u03b8 ))^2 ]\n\nThis seems complex, but let's compute term by term.\n\nFirst term inside sqrt:\n\n(L\u00b2/4)(1 + cos\u03b8)^2 + (24 - (L/2 sin\u03b8 ))^2\n\n= (L\u00b2/4)(1 + 2 cos\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + [24\u00b2 - 24 L sin\u03b8 + (L\u00b2/4) sin\u00b2\u03b8 ]\n\nExpand:\n\n= (L\u00b2/4 + (L\u00b2/2) cos\u03b8 + (L\u00b2/4) cos\u00b2\u03b8 ) + (576 -24 L sin\u03b8 + (L\u00b2/4) sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nThe L\u00b2 terms:\n\n(L\u00b2/4)(1 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) + (L\u00b2/2) cos\u03b8\n\nSince cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1, so:\n\n(L\u00b2/4)(2) + (L\u00b2/2) cos\u03b8 = (L\u00b2/2) + (L\u00b2/2 cos\u03b8 )\n\nThen the other terms:\n\n576 -24 L sin\u03b8\n\nThus, overall:\n\nXD squared = (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8\n\nHmm, so XD = sqrt( (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\nHmm, complicated.\n\nSimilarly, the area of AXD is 12x, as before. Since x = (L/2)(1 + cos\u03b8), so area is 12*(L/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 )=6 L (1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nCircumradius R1=13:\n\nR1 = (AX * XD * AD )/(4 *\u0394_AXD )\n\nPlug in the values:\n\nAX = L cos(\u03b8/2 )\n\nXD = sqrt( (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\nAD =24\n\n\u0394_AXD =6 L (1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nThus,\n\n13 = [ L cos(\u03b8/2 ) * sqrt( ... ) *24 ] / [4 *6 L (1 + cos\u03b8 ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator: 24 L (1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nNumerator terms:\n\nAX * XD * AD = L cos(\u03b8/2 ) * sqrt( (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 ) *24\n\nDenominator:\n\n4 *\u0394_AXD =4 *6 L (1 + cos\u03b8 ) =24 L (1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nThus,\n\nR1= [ 24 L cos(\u03b8/2 ) * sqrt(...) ] / [24 L (1 + cos\u03b8 ) ] = [ cos(\u03b8/2 ) / (1 + cos\u03b8 ) ] * sqrt( ... )\n\nHmm, this seems too involved. Maybe there's a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, think about the problem in terms of coordinate variables and try to find L.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume AB is 26 or 30 since the radii are 13 and 15, which are half of 26 and 30. Maybe AB is 26 and BC is 24, but then the rectangle would be 26x24. Let me see if that works.\n\nSuppose AB=26, so L=26.\n\nCheck if this works.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf L=26, then Equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =26x.\n\nEquation for AXD's circumradius 13:\n\nWe can compute AX * XD / (2x) =13 (from equation 2).\n\nAX = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt(26x), and XD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(26x) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) / (2x )=13 \u21d2 sqrt(26x * (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )) / (2x ) =13 \u21d2 sqrt(26x (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )) =26x \u21d2\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n26x (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = (26x)^2 \u21d2\n\nx\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 =26x \u21d2\n\nBut from Equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =26x \u21d2 substituting:\n\n26x - y\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 =26x \u21d2\n\nExpand (24 - y)^2 =576 -48y +y\u00b2 \u21d2\n\nSo,\n\n26x - y\u00b2 +576 -48y +y\u00b2 =26x \u21d2\n\n26x +576 -48y =26x \u21d2576 -48y=0 \u21d2 y=12.\n\nSo if L=26, then y=12.\n\nThen from Equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + (12)^2 =26x \u21d2x\u00b2 -26x +144=0 \u21d2 discriminant: 26\u00b2 -4*144 =676-576=100 \u21d2 x=(26\u00b110)/2 \u21d2 x= (36)/2=18 or x=16/2=8.\n\nThus x=18 or x=8. Since AB=26, x must be between 0 and26, so both valid.\n\nNow, check if triangles AXD and BXC are acute.\n\nFirst, with L=26, y=12, and x=18 or 8.\n\nLet me check for x=18:\n\nX is at (18,12). Let's see triangles AXD and BXC.\n\nFirst AXD: points A(0,0), X(18,12), D(0,24).\n\nCompute the sides:\n\nAX: distance from A to X: sqrt(18\u00b2 +12\u00b2)=sqrt(324+144)=sqrt(468)=6*sqrt(13)\n\nXD: from X(18,12) to D(0,24): sqrt(18\u00b2 +12\u00b2)= same as AX: sqrt(324 + 144)=sqrt(468)=6\u221a13\n\nAD:24.\n\nSo triangle AXD has two sides of 6\u221a13 and one side of24.\n\nCheck if it's acute.\n\nCompute the angles using the law of cosines.\n\nThe largest side is AD=24.\n\nCheck if 24\u00b2 < (6\u221a13)^2 + (6\u221a13)^2 ?\n\n24\u00b2=576\n\n(6\u221a13)^2 *2= 36*13*2= 36*26=936.\n\n576 <936, so yes, angle opposite AD is acute. Thus, triangle is acute.\n\nSimilarly for the other sides.\n\nNow, triangle BXC with point X(18,12):\n\nPoints B(26,0), X(18,12), C(26,24).\n\nCompute sides:\n\nBX: sqrt( (26-18)^2 + (0-12)^2 )=sqrt(8\u00b2 +12\u00b2)=sqrt(64+144)=sqrt(208)=4\u221a13\n\nXC: sqrt( (26-18)^2 + (24-12)^2 )=sqrt(8\u00b2 +12\u00b2)= same as BX:4\u221a13\n\nBC=24.\n\nSo triangle BXC also has two sides of 4\u221a13 and one side of24.\n\nSimilarly, 24\u00b2=576 vs (4\u221a13)^2 + (4\u221a13)^2 = 2*(16*13)= 416. 576>416, so angle opposite BC (which is 24) would be obtuse. Wait, but the problem states that triangle BXC is acute. So this is a problem. Therefore, x=18 would make triangle BXC obtuse, which violates the condition.\n\nTherefore, x=18 is invalid. Let me check x=8.\n\nIf x=8, then X is at (8,12).\n\nThen for triangle BXC:\n\nPoints B(26,0), X(8,12), C(26,24).\n\nCompute BX: sqrt( (26-8)^2 + (0-12)^2 )=sqrt(18\u00b2 +12\u00b2)=sqrt(324 +144)=sqrt(468)=6\u221a13\n\nXC: sqrt( (26-8)^2 + (24-12)^2 )= same as BX: sqrt(324+144)=sqrt(468)=6\u221a13\n\nBC=24.\n\nThus triangle BXC has sides 6\u221a13,6\u221a13,24. Then same as before, the largest side is 24. Check if 24\u00b2 < (6\u221a13)^2 + (6\u221a13)^2 ?\n\nSame as before, 24\u00b2=576 < 2*(36*13)=936, so angle opposite BC is acute, so triangle BXC is acute.\n\nSimilarly, triangle AXD with x=8:\n\nPoints A(0,0), X(8,12), D(0,24):\n\nAX= sqrt(8\u00b2 +12\u00b2)=sqrt(64+144)=sqrt(208)=4\u221a13\n\nXD= sqrt(8\u00b2 + (24-12)^2 )= sqrt(64 + 144)= sqrt(208)=4\u221a13\n\nAD=24.\n\nThus triangle AXD has sides 4\u221a13,4\u221a13,24. Then same as above, the largest side is 24. 24\u00b2=576 < 2*( (4\u221a13)^2 )= 2*(16*13)=416*2? Wait, (4\u221a13)^2 is 16*13=208, so two of those would be 416, which is less than 576. Wait, that would mean angle opposite AD (24) is obtuse?\n\nWait, hold on, if sides are 4\u221a13,4\u221a13,24.\n\nThe largest side is 24.\n\nLaw of cosines: 24\u00b2 = (4\u221a13)^2 + (4\u221a13)^2 - 2*(4\u221a13)*(4\u221a13)*cos\u03b8, where \u03b8 is the angle between the two 4\u221a13 sides.\n\nWait, actually, angle opposite 24 would be between the two equal sides. Wait, formula is:\n\nc\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2ab cos\u03b3\n\nWhere \u03b3 is angle opposite c.\n\nThus, 24\u00b2 = (4\u221a13)^2 + (4\u221a13)^2 - 2*(4\u221a13)^2 * cos\u03b3\n\nCompute:\n\n24\u00b2 = 208 + 208 - 2*208 * cos\u03b3 \u21d2 576 =416 -416 cos\u03b3 \u21d2\n\n576 -416 = -416 cos\u03b3 \u21d2160 = -416 cos\u03b3 \u21d2 cos\u03b3= -160/416= -10/26 \u2248 -0.3846\n\nThus angle \u03b3 is greater than 90\u00b0, so triangle AXD would be obtuse. Which violates the problem's condition that both triangles are acute.\n\nHmm, so with L=26, both x=8 and x=18 give one triangle acute and the other obtuse. Thus L=26 is invalid.\n\nHmm, so maybe my assumption was wrong.\n\nWait, but in x=8 case, triangle AXD is obtuse but triangle BXC is acute. In x=18 case, AXD is acute but BXC is obtuse. So neither satisfies both triangles being acute. Thus L=26 is invalid. Hmm.\n\nHmm, so maybe AB is 25 or 30?\n\nWait, let me try L=30.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf L=30, then equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=30x.\n\nEquation for AXD's circumradius 13:\n\nAX * XD / (2x)=13. So,\n\nAX = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt(30x).\n\nXD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(30x) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) / (2x) =13 \u21d2 sqrt(30x(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )) / (2x) =13 \u21d2 sqrt(30x(...)) =26x \u21d2 square both sides:\n\n30x*(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )=676x\u00b2 \u21d2 divide by x (x\u22600):\n\n30*(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )=676x \u21d2\n\nFrom equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =30x \u21d2 y\u00b2 =30x -x\u00b2 \u21d2 (24 - y)^2 =576 -48 y +y\u00b2 =576 -48y +30x -x\u00b2\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 =x\u00b2 +576 -48y +30x -x\u00b2 =576 -48y +30x\n\nThus,\n\n30*(576 -48y +30x)=676x \u21d2\n\n17,280 -1,440 y +900x =676x \u21d2\n\n17,280 -1,440 y +224x=0 \u21d2\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n224x -1,440 y =-17,280 \u21d2 divide both sides by 8:\n\n28x -180 y =-2,160 \u21d2\n\n14x -90 y =-1,080 \u21d2\n\nHmm, also from equation (1): y\u00b2 =30x -x\u00b2 \u21d2 y= sqrt(30x -x\u00b2 )\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe try to find y in terms of x or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if with L=30, can I find an x and y that satisfy the equation?\n\nAlternatively, let me try the same approach as with L=26, but see if it works.\n\nAssume L=30.\n\nSuppose for triangle AXD circumradius 13,\n\nFrom AX * XD/(2x)=13,\n\nAX= sqrt(30x),\n\nXD= sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(30x) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =26x \u21d2\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n30x*(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =676x\u00b2 \u21d2\n\nDivide by x:\n\n30*(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =676x \u21d2\n\nBut from equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =30x \u21d2 (24 - y)^2 =576 -48y + y\u00b2=576-48y +30x -x\u00b2\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 =x\u00b2 +576 -48y +30x -x\u00b2=576 -48y +30x\n\nTherefore,\n\n30*(576 -48y +30x)=676x \u21d2\n\n17,280 -1,440y +900x=676x \u21d2\n\n17,280 -1,440y +224x=0 \u21d2\n\n224x -1,440y = -17,280 \u21d2\n\nDivide both sides by 16:\n\n14x -90y = -1,080 \u21d2\n\nLet me write this as 14x =90y -1,080 \u21d2 x=(90y -1080)/14= (45y -540)/7.\n\nAlso from equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=30x \u21d2\n\nPlug x=(45y -540)/7 into this equation:\n\n[(45y -540)/7]^2 + y\u00b2 =30*(45y -540)/7\n\nThis is going to be messy but let's compute:\n\nFirst term:\n\n(45y -540)^2 /49 + y\u00b2 = (30*(45y -540))/7\n\nMultiply all terms by 49 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(45y -540)^2 +49y\u00b2 = 30*7*(45y -540)=210*(45y -540)\n\nExpand (45y -540)^2:\n\n= (45y)^2 -2*45y*540 +540\u00b2 =2025 y\u00b2 -48,600 y +291,600\n\nThus,\n\n2025 y\u00b2 -48,600 y +291,600 +49y\u00b2=210*(45y -540)\n\nCombine terms on left:\n\n2025y\u00b2 +49y\u00b2 =2074y\u00b2,\n\n-48,600 y,\n\n+291,600.\n\nRight side:\n\n210*45y =9,450 y,\n\n210*(-540)= -113,400.\n\nThus equation:\n\n2074 y\u00b2 -48,600 y +291,600 =9,450 y -113,400\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2074 y\u00b2 -48,600 y -9,450 y +291,600 +113,400 =0 \u21d2\n\n2074 y\u00b2 -58,050 y +405,000 =0\n\nDivide all terms by 2:\n\n1037 y\u00b2 -29,025 y +202,500 =0\n\nThis quadratic in y has discriminant D = (29,025)^2 -4*1037*202,500\n\nThis is a huge number, likely not a perfect square, so perhaps L=30 is not the solution.\n\nHmm, perhaps this trial and error approach isn't the best. Let's think differently.\n\nLet me recall that in the problem, both triangles are acute. For triangle AXD being acute, all angles must be less than 90\u00b0, which implies that the square of each side must be less than the sum of squares of the other two sides.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nPerhaps we can use this condition to find constraints on L.\n\nLet me first consider triangle AXD.\n\nIn triangle AXD, sides are AX, XD, AD=24.\n\nFor all angles to be acute:\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2,\n\nAX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > XD\u00b2,\n\nXD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > AX\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nBut this may add more equations. Let me try.\n\nFirst, for triangle AXD:\n\n1. AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 >24\u00b2,\n\n2. AX\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 > XD\u00b2,\n\n3. XD\u00b2 +24\u00b2 > AX\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly for BXC.\n\nBut since we already have the circumradius, maybe this can be combined.\n\nAlternatively, let me think back to the earlier equations.\n\nRecall that in Equation (4):\n\nx = [ L(L\u00b2 -900) ] / [ 2(L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nAnd we also had from Equation (2b):\n\ny = [ (L\u00b2 -676)x +576 L ] / (48 L )\n\nPerhaps substituting x into that equation for y, then plugging into Equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = Lx.\n\nThis would result in an equation in L only.\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, substitute x from Equation (4) into the expression for y:\n\ny = [ (L\u00b2 -676)*x +576 L ] / (48 L )\n\nPlugging x = [ L(L\u00b2 -900) ] / [ 2(L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nThus,\n\ny = [ (L\u00b2 -676)*( L(L\u00b2 -900)/[2(L\u00b2 -788)] ) +576 L ] / (48 L )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nFirst term: (L\u00b2 -676)*L(L\u00b2 -900)/[2(L\u00b2 -788)]\n\nSecond term:576 L\n\nCombine over common denominator 2(L\u00b2 -788):\n\n= [ (L\u00b2 -676)L(L\u00b2 -900) + 1152 L (L\u00b2 -788) ] / [2(L\u00b2 -788)]\n\nThus,\n\ny = [ numerator ] / [2(L\u00b2 -788) *48 L ]\n\nWait, denominator:\n\nThe entire expression has denominator 48 L from the original equation, so:\n\ny = [ numerator ] / [ 2(L\u00b2 -788) ] divided by (48 L) is the same as multiplied by 1/(48 L):\n\nThus,\n\ny = [ ( (L\u00b2 -676)L(L\u00b2 -900) +1152 L (L\u00b2 -788) ) / (2(L\u00b2 -788)) ] / (48 L )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominators:\n\nThe numerator inside the brackets is:\n\nL [ (L\u00b2 -676)(L\u00b2 -900) +1152 (L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nDenominator:\n\n2(L\u00b2 -788) *48 L =96 L (L\u00b2 -788)\n\nThus,\n\ny= [ L [ (L\u00b2 -676)(L\u00b2 -900) +1152(L\u00b2 -788) ] / 2(L\u00b2 -788) ] / [96 L (L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me re-express:\n\nThe numerator of the big fraction is:\n\nN = (L\u00b2 -676)L(L\u00b2 -900) +1152 L (L\u00b2 -788)\n\nDenominator D = 2(L\u00b2 -788)*48 L = 96 L (L\u00b2 -788)\n\nThus,\n\ny = N / D\n\nNow, plug y and x into Equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = Lx.\n\nCompute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - Lx =0.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, x = [ L(L\u00b2 -900) ] / [ 2(L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nThus, x\u00b2 = [ L\u00b2 (L\u00b2 -900)^2 ] / [4(L\u00b2 -788)^2 ]\n\nSecond term y\u00b2 = [N^2] / [D^2]\n\nThird term Lx = L * [ L(L\u00b2 -900) / (2(L\u00b2 -788)) ] = [ L\u00b2 (L\u00b2 -900) ] / [2(L\u00b2 -788) ]\n\nThus,\n\nEquation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - Lx =0 \u21d2\n\n[L\u00b2 (L\u00b2 -900)^2 ] / [4(L\u00b2 -788)^2 ] + [N\u00b2]/[D\u00b2] - [ L\u00b2 (L\u00b2 -900) ] / [2(L\u00b2 -788) ] =0.\n\nThis equation is extremely complex. It might require plugging in specific L values to find when it equals zero.\n\nGiven that the problem is likely to have an integer answer, perhaps try L= 25, 26, 30, 34, 42, etc.\n\nWait, let me try L= sqrt( something ). Alternatively, let me try L= 25.\n\nWait, let's try L= 25.\n\nIf L=25:\n\nCompute x from Equation (4):\n\nx = [25(25\u00b2 -900)]/[2(25\u00b2 -788)]\n\nFirst compute 25\u00b2 =625.\n\n25\u00b2 -900 =625-900= -275\n\n25\u00b2 -788=625-788= -163.\n\nThus,\n\nx= [25*(-275)]/[2*(-163)]= (-6875)/(-326)=6875/326 \u224821.09\n\nThen, compute y using Equation (4b):\n\nWait, perhaps better to use the expression for y in terms of L and x.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute y:\n\nFirst, compute N and D for L=25.\n\nN = (25\u00b2 -676)*25*(25\u00b2 -900) +1152*25*(25\u00b2 -788)\n\nFirst compute each part:\n\n25\u00b2 -676=625-676= -51\n\n25\u00b2 -900= -275\n\n25\u00b2 -788= -163\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term: (-51)*25*(-275)= (-51)*25*(-275)=51*25*275. Let me compute:\n\n25*275= 25*(200+75)=5000+1875=6875\n\nThus first term: 51*6875= 51*6000=306000; 51*875=44,625 \u2192 total 306000+44,625= 350,625\n\nSecond term: 1152*25*(-163)=1152*25*(-163). Compute 1152*25=28,800. Then 28,800*(-163)= -28,800*163. Let me compute 28,800*100=2,880,000; 28,800*60=1,728,000; 28,800*3=86,400. Total 2,880,000+1,728,000=4,608,000 +86,400=4,694,400. Thus with the negative: -4,694,400.\n\nThus N = 350,625 -4,694,400 = -4,343,775\n\nDenominator D=96*25*(25\u00b2 -788)=96*25*(-163)=96*(-4075)= let's see:\n\nWait, 25*(L\u00b2 -788)=25*(-163)= -4075,\n\nSo D=96*L*(L\u00b2-788)=96*25*(-163)=96*(-4075)= -391, 200? Let me compute 96*4000=384,000, so 96*(-4075)= -96*(4000+75)= -384,000 -7,200= -391,200.\n\nThus,\n\ny = N / D = (-4,343,775)/(-391,200)=4,343,775 /391,200 \u224811.1.\n\nSo y\u224811.1.\n\nThen, check Equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 \u2248 (21.09)^2 + (11.1)^2 \u2248444.7 +123.2\u2248567.9\n\nLx=25*21.09\u2248527.25.

So if triangle had a right angle, then hypotenuse would be 26. But since it's acute, the hypotenuse must be less than 26.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC with circumradius 15 (half of 30) must have hypotenuse less than 30.\n\nBut perhaps the sides of the triangles relate to the radii.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in an acute triangle, the circumradius R is related to the sides and the angles, but perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nWait, perhaps use coordinates with smarter substitutions.\n\nLet me consider that since AXB is a right angle, then X lies on the circle with diameter AB. The center is at (L/2,0), radius L/2.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of X as (L/2 + (L/2)cos\u03b8, 0 + (L/2)sin\u03b8), as before. Then, X is ( (L(1 + cos\u03b8))/2, (L/2)sin\u03b8 )\n\nLet me denote \u03b8 as the angle from the positive x-axis to the point on the circle.\n\nNow, let me compute the circumradius for AXD and BXC in terms of L and \u03b8.\n\nFirst, compute AXD's sides:\n\nAX: distance from A(0,0) to X:\n\nAX = sqrt( [ (L/2 (1 + cos\u03b8))\u00b2 + (L/2 sin\u03b8)^2 ] ) = (L/2) sqrt( (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = (L/2) sqrt( 1 + 2cos\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = (L/2)sqrt(2 + 2cos\u03b8 ) = (L/2)*sqrt(4 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2)) ) = L cos(\u03b8/2)\n\nSimilarly, XD is the distance from X to D(0,24):\n\nXD = sqrt( [L/2 (1 + cos\u03b8)]\u00b2 + [24 - L/2 sin\u03b8]^2 )\n\n= sqrt( (L\u00b2/4)(1 + cos\u03b8)^2 + (24 - (L/2 sin\u03b8 ))^2 )\n\nThis is a bit complex. Let me expand:\n\n= sqrt( L\u00b2/4 (1 + 2cos\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + 576 -24 L sin\u03b8 + L\u00b2/4 sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= sqrt( L\u00b2/4 (1 + 2cos\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\nSince cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1,\n\n= sqrt( L\u00b2/4 (2 + 2cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\n= sqrt( (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\nSimilarly, the area of AXD is 12x =12*(L/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 )=6L (1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nCircumradius formula R1 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4\u0394_AXD)\n\nPlugging in:\n\nAX = L cos(\u03b8/2 )\n\nXD = sqrt( (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\nAD =24\n\n\u0394_AXD =6L (1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nThus,\n\nR1 = [ L cos(\u03b8/2 ) * sqrt( ... ) *24 ] / [4 *6L (1 + cos\u03b8 ) ]\n\nSimplify denominator: 24L (1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nSo,\n\nR1 = [ cos(\u03b8/2 ) / (1 + cos\u03b8 ) ] * sqrt( (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\nSimilarly, for R1=13,\n\n13 = [ cos(\u03b8/2 ) / (1 + cos\u03b8 ) ] * sqrt( (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\nThis still seems complex, but notice that cos(\u03b8/2)/ (1 + cos\u03b8 ) can be simplified:\n\ncos(\u03b8/2)/ (1 + cos\u03b8 ) = cos(\u03b8/2)/ [ 2 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2) ] =1/(2 cos(\u03b8/2))\n\nThus,\n\n13 = (1/(2 cos(\u03b8/2))) * sqrt( (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 cos(\u03b8/2):\n\n26 cos(\u03b8/2) = sqrt( (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n676 cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2 ) = (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8\n\nNote that cos\u00b2(\u03b8/2 ) = (1 + cos\u03b8)/2, so left side:\n\n676*(1 + cos\u03b8)/2 = 338(1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nThus,\n\n338(1 + cos\u03b8) = (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8\n\nRearrange:\n\n338(1 + cos\u03b8) -

Alternatively, maybe assume D is an integer such that D\u00b2 -12544 is a perfect square and 788-D is also a square or something. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that D is a divisor of 6272 or other terms, but this might take time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try specific values of L that make D=788 -L\u00b2 a nice number.\n\nLet me suppose that L is an integer. Let me try L= 24: D=788-576=212. Not sure.\n\nL=26: D=788-676=112. Then cos\u03b8=112/112=1 \u21d2 \u03b8=0\u00b0, but then point X would be at (L/2 (1+1),0)=(L,0)= point B, which is on the edge, but the problem states X is inside.

Let me try to find D such that D is such that 112/D is between -1 and1. Since cos\u03b8 must be between -1 and1. Here, D=788-L\u00b2, and since L is positive length, D must be less than788.\n\nAlso, cos\u03b8 =112/D must be \u22641 \u21d2 D\u2265112.

Hmm, 564 is 4\u00d7141=4\u00d73\u00d747, so sqrt(564)=2\u00d7sqrt(141). Not integer.\n\nHmm, but maybe the approximation is due to calculation error.

Let's compute 194\u00b2=37636, which is 4 more. So sqrt(37632)= approx193.988.\n\nThus sqrt(37632)/224\u2248193.988/224\u22480.866, which matches sin\u03b8=sin60\u00b0\u22480.866.\n\nThus, the equation holds approximately.\n\nThus D=224 is a solution.\n\nTherefore, L= sqrt(788-D)=sqrt(564).\n\nBut since the problem might require an exact value or perhaps the question expects an integer, but L is sqrt(564)= 2*sqrt(141). Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, but let's check if this gives valid triangles.\n\nIf L=sqrt(564), then coordinates of X are:\n\ncos\u03b8=112/D=112/224=0.5 \u21d2\u03b8=60\u00b0,\n\nThus,\n\nX's coordinates:\n\nx= (L/2)(1 + cos\u03b8)= (sqrt(564)/2)(1+0.5)= (sqrt(564)/2)(1.5)= (3/4)sqrt(564 )\n\ny= (L/2) sin\u03b8= (sqrt(564)/2)(sqrt(3)/2)= (sqrt(564)*sqrt(3))/4= sqrt(1692)/4= sqrt(4\u00d7423)/4= (2 sqrt(423))/4= sqrt(423)/2 \u224814.78\n\nCheck if triangles are acute.\n\nFor triangle AXD:\n\nAX= L cos(\u03b8/2)= sqrt(564)*cos(30\u00b0)=sqrt(564)*(sqrt(3)/2)=sqrt(564*3)/2=sqrt(1692)/2\u224832.88/2\u224828.93\n\nXD= sqrt( (L\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\nCompute L\u00b2=564,\n\nL\u00b2/2=282,\n\n1 +cos\u03b8=1.5,\n\nThus, term1=282*1.5=423,\n\nterm2=576 -24*L*sin\u03b8,\n\nL sin\u03b8= sqrt(564)* (sqrt(3)/2)= same as above,\n\n24*L sin\u03b8=24*(sqrt(564)*sqrt(3)/2)=12*sqrt(1692)=12*41.13\u2248493.56,\n\nThus term2=576 -493.56\u224882.44,\n\nThus XD= sqrt(423+82.44)=sqrt(505.44)\u224822.48\n\nAD=24.\n\nThus sides:\n\nAX\u224828.93,\n\nXD\u224822.48,\n\nAD=24.\n\nCheck if all angles are acute:\n\nLargest side is AX\u224828.93.\n\nCheck AX\u00b2 < XD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2:\n\n28.93\u00b2 \u2248837,\n\nXD\u00b2+AD\u00b2\u2248505.44 +576\u22481081.44>837 \u21d2 OK.\n\nSimilarly other sides:\n\nXD\u00b2 +AX\u00b2 > AD\u00b2: yes.\n\nAD\u00b2 +XD\u00b2 >AX\u00b2: yes.\n\nThus triangle AXD is acute.\n\nFor triangle BXC:\n\nBX= L sin(\u03b8/2)=sqrt(564)*sin(30\u00b0)= sqrt(564)*0.5\u224823.75*0.5\u224811.88,\n\nXC= sqrt( (L\u00b2/2)(1 -cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24 L sin\u03b8 )\n\nL\u00b2/2=282,\n\n1 -cos\u03b8=0.5,\n\nterm1=282*0.5=141,\n\nterm2=576 -24 L sin\u03b8= same as before, term2\u224882.44,\n\nThus XC= sqrt(141 +82.44)=sqrt(223.44)=\u224814.95,\n\nBC=24.\n\nSides:\n\nBX\u224811.88,\n\nXC\u224814.95,\n\nBC=24.\n\nLargest side BC=24.\n\nCheck BC\u00b2 < BX\u00b2 + XC\u00b2:\n\n24\u00b2=576,\n\nBX\u00b2+XC\u00b2\u2248(141.15)+(223.44)=364.59 <576 \u21d2 Not acute. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nHmm, so the triangle BXC would have an obtuse angle opposite BC. So this contradicts the problem's condition. Thus, D=224 is invalid.\n\nHmm, so close but not quite. Maybe need to find another D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps D= 168:\n\ncos\u03b8=112/168\u22480.6667 \u21d2\u03b8=48.19 degrees.\n\nsin\u03b8\u22480.745.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n576 +6272/168 -168/2=576 +37.333 -84= (576-84)=492 +37.333\u2248529.333\n\nDenominator:24*sqrt(788-168)=24*sqrt(620)=24*24.9\u2248597.6\n\nsin\u03b8\u2248529.333/597.6\u22480.886 vs actual\u22480.745.

Maybe I need to set up the equation properly.\n\nRecall that after substituting cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 in terms of D, we had an equation:\n\nsqrt(D\u00b2 -12544)/D = [576 +6272/D -D/2 ] / [24 sqrt(788 - D ) ]\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n24 sqrt(788 - D ) sqrt(D\u00b2 -12544) = [576 D +6272 - D\u00b2/2 ] \n\nSquare both sides:\n\n24\u00b2 (788 - D)(D\u00b2 -12544) = [576D +6272 - D\u00b2/2 ]\u00b2\n\nThis is a quartic equation in D, which is very complicated to solve without computational tools. Perhaps the problem is designed such that L is 25 or another integer, but my trials didn't work.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the problem might have AB=25. Let me try L=25 again.\n\nWait earlier when I tried L=25, got y\u224811.1 and x\u224821.09. Let me check if triangles are acute.\n\nCompute for AXD:\n\nAX= sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)= sqrt(21.09\u00b2 +11.1\u00b2)=sqrt(444+123)=sqrt(567)=\u224823.81,\n\nXD= sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2)=sqrt(21.09\u00b2 +12.9\u00b2)=sqrt(444+166)=sqrt(610)=\u224824.7,\n\nAD=24.\n\nCheck if all angles acute:\n\nLargest side is XD\u224824.7,\n\nCheck XD\u00b2 < AX\u00b2 +AD\u00b2: 610 < 567 +576=1143 \u2192 yes.\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2: yes.\n\nAX\u00b2 +AD\u00b2 >XD\u00b2: yes.\n\nSo AXD is acute.\n\nFor BXC:\n\nBX= sqrt( (25-21.09)^2 + (0-11.1)^2 )\u2248sqrt(14.6+123)=sqrt(137.6)=\u224811.73.\n\nXC= sqrt( (25-21.09)^2 + (24-11.1)^2 )\u2248sqrt(14.6 +166)=sqrt(180.6)=\u224813.44.\n\nBC=24.\n\nCheck largest side BC=24,\n\n24\u00b2=576,\n\nBX\u00b2 +XC\u00b2\u2248137.6+180.6\u2248318.2 <576 \u2192 obtuse angle at BC. Thus triangle BXC is obtuse. Not valid.\n\nThus L=25 invalid.\n\nWait, but if L= sqrt(564)\u224823.75, the problem is that triangle BXC is obtuse.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the correct L is 25, but the problem states both triangles are acute. Maybe I made an error in calculation.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate for L=sqrt(564)\u224823.75:\n\nCoordinates of X:\n\n\u03b8=60\u00b0, so:\n\nx= (L/2)(1 +0.5)=0.75 L\u22480.75\u00d723.75\u224817.81,\n\ny= (L/2)*sin60\u224811.87\u00d70.866\u224810.29.\n\nWait, previously I might have miscalculated coordinates. Let me recompute:\n\nL= sqrt(564)=\u224823.75,\n\n\u03b8=60\u00b0,\n\nx= (L/2)(1+cos\u03b8)= (23.75/2)(1.5)=11.875\u00d71.5\u224817.81,\n\ny= (L/2) sin\u03b8=11.875 \u00d70.866\u224810.29.\n\nThen, for triangle BXC:\n\nPoints B(23.75,0), X(17.81,10.29), C(23.75,24)\n\nCompute BX:\n\nsqrt( (23.75-17.81)^2 + (0-10.29)^2 )\u2248sqrt( (5.94)^2 + (-10.29)^2 )\u2248sqrt(35.3+105.9)=sqrt(141.2)=\u224811.89,\n\nXC:\n\nsqrt( (23.75-17.81)^2 + (24-10.29)^2 )\u2248sqrt(5.94\u00b2 +13.71\u00b2)=sqrt(35.3+188)=sqrt(223.3)=\u224814.94,\n\nBC=24.\n\nLargest side BC=24.\n\nCheck angles:\n\nBC\u00b2=576,\n\nBX\u00b2 +XC\u00b2\u2248141+223=364 <576 \u21d2 angle at X is obtuse.\n\nThus, BXC is obtuse. Not valid.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, the only time when the angle opposite the largest side (BC) is acute is when BC\u00b2 < BX\u00b2 +XC\u00b2, but in this case it's not.\n\nThus perhaps the solution requires a different D where this holds.\n\nLet me try D= 338\u00d72=676? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem differently.\n\nRecall that in the problem, both triangles AXD and BXC have their circumradii given, which are 13 and 15 respectively. Circumradius formulas for triangles:\n\nR1 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4\u0394_AXD),\n\nR2 = (BX * XC * BC)/(4\u0394_BXC).\n\nGiven that AD=BC=24,\n\nThus,\n\n13 = (AX * XD *24)/(4*\u0394_AXD),\n\n15 = (BX * XC *24)/(4*\u0394_BXC).\n\nWe also know that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 = L\u00b2.\n\nAdditionally, from coordinate geometry, AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = (x\u00b2+y\u00b2) + [(L-x)^2 + y\u00b2] =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + L\u00b2 -2Lx +x\u00b2 +y\u00b2 = 2x\u00b2 +2y\u00b2 -2Lx +L\u00b2. But from Equation (1), x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =Lx \u21d2 substitute:\n\n2(Lx) -2Lx +L\u00b2 = L\u00b2. Thus, AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 =L\u00b2, which confirms that AXB is right-angled.\n\nThus, we have the following equations:\n\n1. AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = L\u00b2 (from Pythagoras)\n\n2. R1 = (AX * XD *24)/(4*\u0394_AXD) =13\n\n3.

Maybe L= 24+ something. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet me set variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let AX = a, XD = b, AD =24,\n\nthen for triangle AXD, the circumradius R1=13,\n\nso 13 = (a*b*24)/(4*\u0394_AXD ) \u21d2 \u0394_AXD = (a b 24)/ (4*13 ) \u21d2 \u0394= (6ab)/13.\n\nAlso, area \u0394_AXD=12x, so 12x=6ab/13 \u21d2 x= (ab)/(26).\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\nBX =c, XC=d, BC=24,\n\nR2=15 \u21d2 15 = (c*d*24)/(4*\u0394_BXC ) \u21d2 \u0394_BXC = (c d 24)/(4*15)= (4 c d)/5,\n\nAlso, \u0394_BXC=12(L -x ), so 12(L -x)=4cd/5 \u21d2 L -x= (cd)/(15).\n\nMoreover, from angle AXB=90\u00b0,\n\nAX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 \u21d2 a\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =L\u00b2.\n\nAlso, in terms of coordinates,\n\nAX\u00b2= a\u00b2 =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nBX\u00b2 =c\u00b2= (L -x)^2 + y\u00b2,\n\nthus,\n\na\u00b2 +c\u00b2= x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + (L -x)^2 + y\u00b2 =x\u00b2 -2Lx +L\u00b2 +2y\u00b2 +x\u00b2= 2x\u00b2 -2Lx +L\u00b2 +2y\u00b2,\n\nBut from Equation (1), x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =Lx \u21d2 y\u00b2=Lx -x\u00b2,\n\nSubstitute,\n\na\u00b2 +c\u00b2=2x\u00b2 -2Lx +L\u00b2 +2(Lx -x\u00b2)=2x\u00b2-2Lx +L\u00b2 +2Lx -2x\u00b2=L\u00b2 \u21d2 consistent with AXB right angle.\n\nNow, need to link these variables with the other conditions.\n\nAlso,\n\nFor triangle AXD:\n\nThe sides are a, b,24.\n\nThe area is \u0394= (a b 24)/(4*13)= (6ab)/13.\n\nBut also the area is 12x= (ab)/26 \u21d2 (ab)/26 =6ab/13 \u21d2 this implies 1/26 =6/13 \u21d2 which is not true.\n\nWait, this suggests inconsistency, meaning I must have messed up.\n\nWait, let's re-express:\n\nFor triangle AXD:\n\nCircumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394), where c is the third side (AD=24).\n\nThus R1 = (a*b*24)/(4\u0394_AXD) =13 \u21d2\n\nThus \u0394_AXD = (a*b*24)/(4*13)= (6ab)/13.\n\nBut \u0394_AXD is also 12x, so:\n\n12x =6ab/13 \u21d2 x= (ab)/(26).\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC:\n\n\u0394_BXC =12(L -x)= (c*d*24)/(4*15)= (4cd)/5 \u21d2\n\n12(L -x)=4cd/5 \u21d2 L -x= (cd)/15.\n\nAdditionally, the sides XD and XC can be expressed in terms of coordinates:\n\nXD =b= sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2),\n\nXC =d= sqrt( (L -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ).\n\nAlso, AX=a= sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\nBX=c= sqrt( (L -x)^2 + y\u00b2).\n\nFurthermore, from equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =Lx \u21d2 y\u00b2 =Lx -x\u00b2.\n\nThus, XD =sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)=sqrt(x\u00b2 +24\u00b2 -48y +y\u00b2)=sqrt(x\u00b2 +y\u00b2 +576 -48y)=sqrt(Lx +576 -48y).\n\nSimilarly, XC =sqrt( (L -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )=sqrt( (L -x)^2 + y\u00b2 -48y +576 )=sqrt( (L -x)^2 + y\u00b2 +576 -48y ).\n\nBut (L -x)^2 + y\u00b2 = L\u00b2 -2Lx +x\u00b2 +y\u00b2 = L\u00b2 -2Lx +Lx =L\u00b2 -Lx \u21d2 since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =Lx.\n\nThus,\n\nXC= sqrt( (L\u00b2 -Lx) +576 -48y ).\n\nThus,\n\nXD= sqrt(Lx +576 -48y),\n\nXC= sqrt(L\u00b2 -Lx +576 -48y ).\n\nLet me denote K=576 -48y,\n\nthen,\n\nXD= sqrt(Lx +K),\n\nXC= sqrt(L\u00b2 -Lx +K).\n\nMoreover, from AX=a= sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=sqrt(Lx),\n\nBX=c= sqrt(L\u00b2 -Lx).\n\nThus,\n\na=sqrt(Lx),\n\nc=sqrt(L(L -x)),\n\nb=XD= sqrt(Lx +K),\n\nd=XC= sqrt(L\u00b2 -Lx +K),\n\nAlso, K=576 -48y.\n\nBut y can be expressed via equation (1): y= sqrt(Lx -x\u00b2). However, this may not be helpful.\n\nLet me see if I can express K in terms of L and x:\n\nK=576 -48y,\n\ny= sqrt(Lx -x\u00b2),\n\nThus,\n\nK=576 -48sqrt(Lx -x\u00b2).\n\nThis introduces a square root, complicating things.\n\nAlternatively, consider that:\n\nIn triangle AXD,\n\nSides are a=sqrt(Lx), b= sqrt(Lx +K), and AD=24.\n\nThus, using the Law of Sines:\n\na/sin(angle opposite)= 2R,\n\nSimilarly,\n\na/sin(angle at D)=2*13=26,\n\nBut angle at D is between XD and AD.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach isn't better.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the complexity, I think the answer is likely 25 or 30, but since with L=25, triangle BXC is obtuse, and L=30 also didn't work.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the parametrization earlier. Let me think of another way.\n\nLet me denote AX = m, XD =n, so for triangle AXD,\n\nCircumradius R1=13= (m*n*24)/(4*(12x )) \u21d2 13= (m n *24)/(48x ) \u21d2 m n=26x,\n\nbut m=AX= sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ), n=XD= sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )=26x,\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC,\n\nBX= sqrt( (L-x)^2 + y\u00b2 ), XC= sqrt( (L -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ),\n\nCircumradius 15 \u21d2 (BX * XC *24 )/(4*(12(L -x )) )=15 \u21d2 BX * XC=30(L -x ).\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt( (L-x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (L -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )=30(L -x )\n\nLet me denote u= y,\n\nv=24 - y,\n\nso that u +v=24.\n\nThen,\n\nFor AXD:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 +u\u00b2 ) * sqrt(x\u00b2 +v\u00b2 )=26x,\n\nFor BXC:\n\nsqrt( (L-x)^2 +u\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (L-x)^2 +v\u00b2 )=30(L -x )\n\nAlso, since u +v=24,\n\nMaybe set u=12+a, v=12-a,\n\nthen,\n\nLet me set u=12+a, v=12-a,\n\nso that,\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + (12+a)^2 ) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (12 -a)^2 )=26x,\n\nand,\n\nsqrt( (L-x)^2 + (12+a)^2 ) * sqrt( (L-x)^2 + (12 -a)^2 )=30(L -x )\n\nThis substitution may simplify the equations.\n\nLet me compute the first equation:\n\nLet me denote A =x\u00b2 + (12+a)^2,\n\nB =x\u00b2 + (12 -a)^2,\n\nthen,\n\nsqrt(A) * sqrt(B)=26x \u21d2 sqrt(AB)=26x \u21d2 AB=676x\u00b2,\n\nCompute AB:\n\nAB= [x\u00b2 +144 +24a +a\u00b2][x\u00b2 +144 -24a +a\u00b2 ] = [x\u00b2 +a\u00b2 +144]^2 - (24a)^2,\n\nThus,\n\n[x\u00b2 +a\u00b2 +144]^2 -576a\u00b2=676x\u00b2,\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n(x\u00b2 +a\u00b2 +144)^2 =x^4 +2x\u00b2(a\u00b2 +144) + (a\u00b2 +144)^2,\n\nThus,\n\nx^4 +2x\u00b2(a\u00b2 +144) + (a\u00b2 +144)^2 -576a\u00b2=676x\u00b2,\n\nRearrange:\n\nx^4 +2x\u00b2(a\u00b2 +144 -338) + (a\u00b2 +144)^2 -576a\u00b2=0,\n\nWait, 2x\u00b2(a\u00b2+144) -676x\u00b2=2x\u00b2(a\u00b2+144-338),\n\n338 is half of 676.\n\nThus,\n\nx^4 +2x\u00b2(a\u00b2 -194) + (a^4 +288a\u00b2 + 20736 ) -576a\u00b2 =0,\n\nSimplify the constants:\n\n(a^4 +288a\u00b2 +20736) -576a\u00b2 =a^4 -288a\u00b2 +20736,\n\nThus,\n\nx^4 +2x\u00b2(a\u00b2 -194) +a^4 -288a\u00b2 +20736=0,\n\nHmm, this seems still complex.\n\nPerhaps assume a=0 (i.e., y=12), then u=12, v=12.\n\nIf a=0,\n\nthen equations become:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2+144)*sqrt(x\u00b2+144)=26x \u21d2 (x\u00b2+144)=26x \u21d2x\u00b2 -26x +144=0,\n\nSolutions x=(26\u00b1sqrt(676-576))/2=(26\u00b110)/2 \u21d218 or8,\n\nThis is the case we considered earlier with L=26, but then triangles were not both acute.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the length of AB in a rectangle ABCD where BC is 24. There's a point X inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, and their circumradii are 13 and 15 respectively. Hmm, this seems a bit complex, but let me try breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me sketch the rectangle ABCD. Let me label the rectangle so that AB is the side we need to find, and BC is given as 24. So, if I consider the rectangle with vertices labeled in order, A is the bottom-left corner, B is the bottom-right, C is the top-right, and D is the top-left. So, AB is the base, BC is the height, which is 24. Therefore, AD and BC are both 24, and AB and CD are the lengths we need to find.\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, and angle AXB is 90 degrees. That means that point X lies somewhere such that when you connect points A to X and B to X, those two lines form a right angle at X. Since it's inside the rectangle, X can't be on the edges, right?\n\nAlso, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. So all their angles are less than 90 degrees. And their circumradii are given as 13 and 15. Remember, the circumradius of a triangle is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides and A is the area. Alternatively, for any triangle, the circumradius can also be expressed as R = a/(2*sin A), where A is the opposite angle. Since the triangles are acute, all their angles are less than 90 degrees, so their sines are positive and less than 1, so the sides must be appropriately related.\n\nLet me set up coordinates to model this problem. Let me place point A at (0,0), so then B would be at (AB, 0), since AB is the length we need to find. Since BC is 24, point C would be at (AB, 24), and point D would be at (0,24). Let me denote AB as x, so coordinates are:\n\nA: (0,0)\nB: (x,0)\nC: (x,24)\nD: (0,24)\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, so its coordinates can be represented as (a, b), where 0 < a < x and 0 < b < 24.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90 degrees. The vectors AX and BX should be perpendicular. The vector AX is (a, b) and the vector BX is (a - x, b). Their dot product should be zero:\n\nAX \u2022 BX = a*(a - x) + b*b = 0\n\nSo that's the first equation:\n\na(a - x) + b\u00b2 = 0. (Equation 1)\n\nNext, triangles AXD and BXC have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively. Let me handle triangle AXD first. The triangle AXD has vertices at A(0,0), X(a,b), and D(0,24). Let me compute the lengths of its sides.\n\nFirst, side AX is the distance from A to X: sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2).\n\nSide XD is the distance from X to D: sqrt( (a - 0)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) = sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nSide AD is the side from A to D, which is 24 units (since AD is vertical from (0,0) to (0,24)), but actually, in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, no, triangle AXD is A, X, D. So sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, AD is a side of the rectangle, but in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, actually, no. Let me check:\n\nWait, triangle AXD has vertices A(0,0), X(a,b), D(0,24). So the three sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, AD is from A to D which is vertical, length 24. But in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, actually, the three sides are between the three pairs of points:\n\nBetween A and X: AX = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\nBetween X and D: XD = sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nBetween D and A: DA = 24, yes. So the three sides of triangle AXD are AX, XD, and DA (24). Hmm.\n\nSimilarly, triangle BXC has vertices B(x,0), X(a,b), and C(x,24). The sides here are BX, XC, and BC (24). The sides:\n\nBX is sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 )\n\nXC is sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nBC is 24.\n\nSo for both triangles AXD and BXC, which are both acute, their circumradii are given as 13 and 15 respectively.\n\nRecall that the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides of length a, b, c is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, since the circumradius can also be expressed using the formula R = a/(2 sin A), where A is the angle opposite side a. Since the triangles are acute, all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so all sines are positive and less than 1. Maybe this formula could be helpful, but perhaps the first formula is better here.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates, maybe we can compute the coordinates in terms of a and b, set up equations for the circumradius, and solve?\n\nAlternatively, since the triangles are acute, maybe some properties can be used?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps coordinate geometry is the way to go here. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's write equations for the circumradius of triangle AXD.\n\nLet me denote triangle AXD with sides:\n\nAX: sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) = let's call this length m,\n\nXD: sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) = n,\n\nDA: 24 = p.\n\nSo sides m, n, p. The area \u0394 of triangle AXD can be calculated using coordinates. The area of triangle with coordinates (0,0), (a,b), (0,24). The area is \u00bd | (0*(b - 24) + a*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - b) ) | = \u00bd | 0 + 24a + 0 | = 12a. So the area is 12a.\n\nTherefore, the circumradius R1 (for triangle AXD) is (m*n*p)/(4*\u0394) = (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2)*24)/(4*12a).\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nFirst, 4*12a = 48a in the denominator.\n\nSo R1 = [24 * sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2)] / (48a)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n24/48 = 1/2, so:\n\nR1 = [ sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2) * 1/2 ] / a\n\nWait, perhaps better to write:\n\nR1 = (24 * sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2)) / (48a)\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 24:\n\nR1 = (sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2)) / (2a)\n\nSo that's equal to 13, given.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\nTriangle BXC has vertices at B(x,0), X(a,b), C(x,24). Let me compute its sides.\n\nBX: sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) = let's call this q,\n\nXC: sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) = r,\n\nBC: 24 = s.\n\nThe area of triangle BXC can be calculated similarly using coordinates. The coordinates are (x,0), (a,b), (x,24). So the area is \u00bd |x*(b - 24) + a*(24 - 0) + x*(0 - b)|.\n\nWait, maybe better to use the shoelace formula:\n\nArea = \u00bd | (x*(b - 24) + a*(24 - 0) + x*(0 - b)) |\n\nWait:\n\nAlternatively, since points B and C are on the vertical line x-coordinate x, so the base BC is vertical from (x,0) to (x,24). The point X is somewhere inside, so the area can also be thought of as the horizontal distance from X to the line BC multiplied by the height difference? Hmm, maybe better to do coordinates step by step.\n\nAlternatively, using the determinant formula:\n\nCoordinates:\n\nB: (x, 0)\n\nX: (a, b)\n\nC: (x, 24)\n\nArea = \u00bd | (x*(b - 24) + a*(24 - 0) + x*(0 - b)) |.\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: x*(b - 24)\n\nSecond term: a*(24 - 0) = 24a\n\nThird term: x*(0 - b) = -x b\n\nSo the total inside the absolute value is x(b -24) +24a - x b = x b -24x +24a -x b = -24x +24a = 24(a - x)\n\nTherefore, the area is \u00bd |24(a - x)| = 12 |a - x|. Since a is between 0 and x, (a - x) is negative, so absolute value makes it 12(x - a).\n\nTherefore, the area of triangle BXC is 12(x - a).\n\nTherefore, the circumradius R2 (for triangle BXC) is (q*r*s)/(4*\u0394) = [ sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) * 24 ] / (4 * 12(x - a) )\n\nSimplify:\n\nSame as before, 4*12(x - a) = 48(x - a) in the denominator.\n\nSo R2 = [24 * sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] / [48(x - a) ]\n\nAgain, simplifying numerator and denominator by 24:\n\nR2 = [ sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) *1 ] / [2(x - a) ]\n\nSet this equal to 15.\n\nSo now, we have two equations from the circumradii:\n\nFirst equation (from triangle AXD):\n\n[ sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] / (2a) = 13\n\nSecond equation (from triangle BXC):\n\n[ sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] / [2(x - a) ] = 15\n\nAdditionally, we have the equation from angle AXB being 90\u00b0, which was:\n\na(a - x) + b\u00b2 = 0 => a\u00b2 - a x + b\u00b2 = 0 (Equation 1)\n\nSo we have three equations here with variables a, b, x. Our goal is to solve for x, which is AB.\n\nHmm, this seems quite involved. Let me see if we can manipulate these equations.\n\nLet me denote variables to simplify:\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote some terms:\n\nLet\u2019s first note that in Equation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x. That's from a\u00b2 - a x + b\u00b2 =0 => a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x.\n\nSo that's helpful. Let me see if that can substitute into the first equation for R1.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nsqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) is sqrt(a x) since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nLet me compute that term:\n\na\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 - 48b + b\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) + 576 - 48b = (a x) + 576 - 48b (from Equation 1)\n\nTherefore, sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) = sqrt( a x + 576 - 48b )\n\nTherefore, the first equation (R1 =13):\n\n[ sqrt(a x) * sqrt( a x + 576 - 48b ) ] / (2a) = 13\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n[ (a x) * (a x + 576 - 48b ) ] / (4a\u00b2) = 13\u00b2 = 169\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator terms:\n\na x * (a x + 576 -48b ) = a x (a x) + a x (576 -48b ) = a\u00b2 x\u00b2 + 576 a x -48 a x b\n\nDivide by 4a\u00b2:\n\n[ a\u00b2 x\u00b2 + 576 a x -48 a x b ] / (4a\u00b2 ) = 169\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: a\u00b2x\u00b2 / 4a\u00b2 = x\u00b2 /4\n\nSecond term: 576 a x /4a\u00b2 = (576 x)/(4a) = 144x/a\n\nThird term: -48 a x b /4a\u00b2 = -12 x b /a\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n( x\u00b2 /4 ) + (144x)/a - (12 x b)/a = 169\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe we can find expressions for b in terms of a and x?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use Equation 1 to express b\u00b2 in terms of a and x, and also find expressions for terms involving b.\n\nWait, Equation 1 gives a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x => b\u00b2 = a x - a\u00b2\n\nTherefore, b = sqrt( a x - a\u00b2 ). But that might not be helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can handle the second equation (R2) similarly.\n\nLet me look at R2 equation:\n\n[ sqrt( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] / [2(x - a) ] =15\n\nSimilarly, let me denote terms here.\n\nLet\u2019s first note that (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2. Let me see if this can be simplified using Equation 1.\n\nFrom Equation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x => b\u00b2 = a x - a\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 - 2a x + a\u00b2) + (a x - a\u00b2) = x\u00b2 - 2a x +a\u00b2 +a x -a\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - a x.\n\nSo (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 = x(x - a).\n\nSimilarly, the other term under the square root in R2's equation:\n\n(x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 = (x\u00b2 - 2a x + a\u00b2) + (24\u00b2 - 48 b + b\u00b2 )\n\nAgain, let's substitute b\u00b2 from Equation 1:\n\n= x\u00b2 -2a x +a\u00b2 + 576 -48b + (a x - a\u00b2 )\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx\u00b2 -2a x +a\u00b2 +576 -48b +a x -a\u00b2\n\nThe a\u00b2 and -a\u00b2 cancel.\n\nx\u00b2 - a x +576 -48 b\n\nTherefore, (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 = x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b\n\nHmm, so the two terms under the square roots in R2's equation are sqrt(x(x - a)) and sqrt(x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b )\n\nTherefore, R2 equation becomes:\n\n[ sqrt(x(x - a)) * sqrt(x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) ] / [2(x -a) ] =15\n\nLet me square both sides here as well to eliminate the square roots:\n\n[ x(x - a) * (x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) ] / [4(x -a)^2 ] = 225\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nCancel one (x -a) in numerator and denominator:\n\n[ x*(x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) ] / [4(x -a) ] =225\n\nHmm, so that's another equation involving x, a, and b.\n\nAt this point, I have two equations from R1 and R2, both involving a, b, x. Plus the original equation from the right angle at X (Equation 1). Let me see if I can find a way to combine these equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find expressions for terms like (x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) from previous equations?\n\nWait, in the first equation after squaring, we had:\n\n( x\u00b2 /4 ) + (144x)/a - (12 x b)/a = 169\n\nLet me note that term (x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) from the R2 equation. Let me see if that can be related.\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFrom the first equation, after squaring, I had:\n\n( x\u00b2 /4 ) + (144x)/a - (12 x b)/a = 169\n\nLet me factor out terms:\n\n( x\u00b2 /4 ) + (12x/a)(12 - b) = 169\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can express (x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) as:\n\nLet me consider the expression:\n\nx\u00b2 - a x + 576 -48b = (x\u00b2 - a x) + (576 -48b )\n\nFrom Equation 1, since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x, so x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/a. Maybe substituting x here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider variables substitution. Let me denote some variables to reduce complexity.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote u = a and v = b. So variables are u, v, x.\n\nEquation 1: u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = u x \u2192 x = (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)/u = u + (v\u00b2)/u\n\nHmm, perhaps that's useful.\n\nNow, let me see the first equation (from R1 squared):\n\n( x\u00b2 /4 ) + (144x)/u - (12 x v)/u = 169\n\nLet me plug x = u + (v\u00b2)/u into this equation. But that might get too messy. Alternatively, perhaps we can find relations between the equations.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in both equations (from R1 and R2 squared) we have terms involving (x\u00b2 - a x) and (576 -48b). Wait, in the first equation, after squaring, the term (x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b) appears in the R2 equation. Wait, actually in the first equation, from R1's squared equation, we have:\n\nAfter expanding, we had:\n\n( x\u00b2 /4 ) + (144x)/a - (12 x b)/a = 169 \u2192 Let me write this as:\n\nx\u00b2 /4 + (12x/a)(12 - b) = 169\n\nWait, 144x/a = 12x/a *12, and -12x b/a = -12x/a *b, so total is 12x/a*(12 - b). Hmm, maybe that's a way to write it.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can find another relation. Since both equations involve terms with x\u00b2 - a x and other terms, perhaps we can combine them.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can express 576 -48b in terms of other variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in both equations, perhaps the product of the terms under the square roots can be related?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires some geometric insight rather than purely algebraic manipulation. Let me think again about the problem.\n\nWe have rectangle ABCD with BC=24, so the height is 24. Point X inside with angle AXB=90\u00b0, so X lies on the circle with diameter AB? Wait, no. Wait, if angle AXB is 90\u00b0, then X lies on the circle with diameter AB. But since X is inside the rectangle, the circle with diameter AB would have its center at the midpoint of AB, which is (x/2, 0), but since the rectangle's height is 24, the circle might extend beyond the rectangle? Hmm, but the problem says X is inside the rectangle, so perhaps the portion of the circle within the rectangle?\n\nWait, actually, the circle with diameter AB would have radius x/2, centered at (x/2, 0). So the topmost point of the circle would be at (x/2, x/2). Since the rectangle's height is 24, to have the circle inside the rectangle, we need x/2 \u226424, so x \u226448. But maybe that's not necessary here because X is just any point on the circle inside the rectangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinate system, the condition angle AXB=90\u00b0 implies that (a, b) lies on the circle with diameter AB. The equation of that circle is (x-coordinate minus midpoint x)^2 + (y-coordinate - midpoint y)^2 = (radius)^2. Since AB is from (0,0) to (x,0), the midpoint is (x/2, 0), and radius is x/2. So the equation is:\n\n( a - x/2 )\u00b2 + ( b - 0 )\u00b2 = (x/2)^2\n\nExpanding this:\n\na\u00b2 - a x + (x\u00b2)/4 + b\u00b2 = x\u00b2/4\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2 - a x + b\u00b2 + x\u00b2/4 = x\u00b2/4 \u2192 a\u00b2 -a x + b\u00b2 =0 \u2192 Which is exactly Equation 1!\n\nAh, so that's a good check. So that equation comes from the circle, which is consistent.\n\nTherefore, we can proceed knowing that.\n\nNow, going back to the equations for the circumradii.\n\nMaybe I can think of the triangles AXD and BXC. Since they are both acute, their circumradius conditions must satisfy certain inequalities. But perhaps the key is to set up the equations properly and solve them.\n\nLet me try to tackle the first equation again, the one from R1=13:\n\nAfter squaring, we had:\n\n( x\u00b2 /4 ) + (144x)/a - (12 x b)/a = 169\n\nLet me factor out 12x/a:\n\n( x\u00b2 /4 ) + (12x/a)(12 - b) = 169 \u2192 Equation A\n\nSimilarly, for the R2 equation after squaring, we had:\n\n[ x*(x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) ] / [4(x -a) ] =225 \u2192 Equation B\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can express (x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) in terms of other variables.\n\nFrom Equation 1, x\u00b2 - a x = x\u00b2 - (a x). Wait, but x\u00b2 - a x = x(x -a). Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps we can write x\u00b2 -a x = (x)^2 -a x, but not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that in Equation A, we have terms with (12 - b). Maybe we can relate this?\n\nAlternatively, let me denote some substitutions.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s call term1 = x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b (which is in Equation B's numerator)\n\nLet me see if I can express term1 using Equation 1 or other equations.\n\nFrom Equation 1, since a x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, so substituting into term1:\n\nterm1 = x\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) +576 -48b = x\u00b2 - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 +576 -48b\n\nHmm, but not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider both equations A and B and try to find a relation between them.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in the first equation (Equation A):\n\nWe have an equation involving x, a, b. Equation B also involves x, a, b, but perhaps if we can find an expression for (x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ), which is term1, from Equation A?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nFrom Equation A:\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx\u00b2 + (144x/a -12x b/a)*4 = 4*169 \u2192 Not sure. Alternatively, maybe express term1 in terms of variables from Equation A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find term1:\n\nterm1 = x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b = (x\u00b2 -a x) + (576 -48b )\n\nFrom Equation 1, x\u00b2 -a x = x\u00b2 - (a x) = x\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) because a x = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2.\n\nWait, so x\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) + 576 -48b\n\n= x\u00b2 -a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 +576 -48b\n\nHmm, perhaps we can consider x\u00b2 -a\u00b2 = (x -a)(x +a )\n\nBut I don't see an immediate simplification.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of variables like s = a + something, but this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assign numerical substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variables in terms of coordinates. Since the problem is coordinate geometry, perhaps there is a way to set variables such that a and b can be expressed in terms of x, and then we can solve for x.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in triangle AXD, which is acute. Since all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so in triangle AXD, the square of each side must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nTherefore:\n\nFor triangle AXD:\n\nAX\u00b2 < XD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2,\n\nXD\u00b2 < AX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2,\n\nAD\u00b2 < AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nBut maybe that's more constraints rather than equations, so perhaps not directly helpful for solving.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can find expressions for b in terms of a and x, or vice versa.\n\nFrom Equation 1: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x \u2192 so, b\u00b2 = a x -a\u00b2 \u2192 b = sqrt(a x -a\u00b2 ). Let me note that.\n\nSo perhaps we can write b in terms of a and x, and substitute into the equations.\n\nLet me try that. Let me let\u2019s denote b = sqrt( a x - a\u00b2 ). But since b is a coordinate inside the rectangle, 0 < b <24, so the expression under sqrt must be positive, so a x -a\u00b2 >0 \u2192 a(x -a ) >0. Since a is between 0 and x, this is true as long as a is not 0 or x, which it isn't because X is inside.\n\nTherefore, b = sqrt( a(x -a) ). Let me write that as b = sqrt(a(x -a)).\n\nHmm, interesting. So, b is expressed in terms of a and x. Maybe substituting this into equations.\n\nLet me attempt substitution into Equation A first.\n\nEquation A: (x\u00b2)/4 + (144x)/a - (12 x b)/a = 169\n\nSince b = sqrt(a(x -a)), substitute:\n\n( x\u00b2 /4 ) + (144x)/a - (12x /a ) * sqrt(a(x -a)) = 169\n\nHmm, this is still complicated. Let me see if I can manipulate terms.\n\nLet me factor out (12x)/a:\n\n( x\u00b2 /4 ) + (12x/a)(12 - sqrt(a(x -a)) ) = 169\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe I need to square both sides at some point, but that could get messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can let\u2019s consider variables substitution for a. Let me let\u2019s set t = a/x, so that a = t x, where 0 < t <1.\n\nThen, since a = t x, then b\u00b2 = a x -a\u00b2 = t x\u00b2 - t\u00b2 x\u00b2 = t x\u00b2 (1 - t )\n\nTherefore, b = x sqrt(t(1 - t )).\n\nTherefore, substituting into equations in terms of t and x.\n\nLet me try this substitution. Let me set t = a/x, so a = t x, and b = x sqrt(t - t\u00b2 )\n\nLet me rewrite all variables in terms of t and x.\n\nFirst, Equation 1 is satisfied by this substitution, so we don't need it anymore.\n\nEquation A (from R1=13):\n\nOriginal Equation A:\n\n( x\u00b2 /4 ) + (144x)/a - (12 x b)/a = 169\n\nSubstituting a = t x, b =x sqrt(t(1-t)),\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2 /4 remains as is.\n\nSecond term: 144x / ( t x ) = 144/( t )\n\nThird term: (12 x * x sqrt(t(1-t)) ) / ( t x ) = (12 x sqrt(t(1-t)) ) / t\n\nWait, let me compute each term step by step:\n\nSecond term: (144x)/a = 144x/(t x) = 144 / t\n\nThird term: (12x b)/a = 12x*(x sqrt(t(1-t)) ) / (t x ) = 12x * x sqrt(t(1-t)) / (t x )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nThe x cancels: 12x * sqrt(t(1-t)) / t = 12x sqrt(t(1-t))/t\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, numerator is 12x multiplied by b, which is x sqrt(t(1-t)), so 12x * x sqrt(...) divided by a (t x). Therefore,\n\nNumerator: 12x * b = 12x*(x sqrt(t(1-t))) = 12x\u00b2 sqrt(t(1-t))\n\nDenominator: a = t x\n\nTherefore, (12x\u00b2 sqrt(...))/ (t x ) = 12x sqrt(t(1-t))/ t\n\nTherefore, third term is (12x sqrt(t(1-t)))/ t\n\nThus, Equation A becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 /4 + (144 / t ) - (12x sqrt(t(1-t)))/ t = 169 \u2192 Equation A'\n\nSimilarly, let's rewrite Equation B (from R2=15):\n\nEquation B after substitution:\n\n[ x*(x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) ] / [4(x -a) ] =225\n\nFirst, compute numerator terms:\n\nFirst, compute x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b.\n\nGiven that a = t x, so a x = t x\u00b2,\n\nThus:\n\nx\u00b2 - a x = x\u00b2 - t x\u00b2 = x\u00b2(1 - t )\n\nThen, the term 576 -48b = 576 -48*(x sqrt(t(1 - t)) )\n\nThus:\n\nx\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b = x\u00b2(1 - t) + 576 -48x sqrt(t(1 - t))\n\nDenominator term (x -a ) = x - t x = x(1 - t )\n\nThus, Equation B becomes:\n\n[ x*( x\u00b2(1 - t ) + 576 -48x sqrt(t(1 - t)) ) ] / [4x(1 - t ) ] =225\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nCancel an x from numerator and denominator:\n\n[ x\u00b2(1 - t ) +576 -48x sqrt(t(1 - t)) ] / [4(1 - t ) ] =225\n\nMultiply both sides by 4(1 - t ):\n\nx\u00b2(1 - t ) +576 -48x sqrt(t(1 - t)) = 900(1 - t )\n\nBring all terms to left-hand side:\n\nx\u00b2(1 - t ) +576 -48x sqrt(t(1 - t)) -900(1 - t ) =0\n\nFactor terms with (1 - t ):\n\n(1 - t)(x\u00b2 -900 ) +576 -48x sqrt(t(1 - t)) =0\n\nHmm, this seems still complex, but perhaps we can proceed.\n\nLet me note that both Equation A' and Equation B are in terms of x and t. So maybe I can attempt to solve them numerically, but since this is a competition problem, likely there's an integer answer, so maybe x is an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a substitution or a way to combine these equations.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the problem might have some symmetry or Pythagorean triples given the circumradii 13 and 15. Since 13 and 15 are part of Pythagorean triples (like 5-12-13, 9-12-15, etc.), perhaps the triangles AXD and BXC have sides related to these triples.\n\nLet me think about triangle AXD first. It has a circumradius of 13. The circumradius formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394). Let me see if maybe the sides correspond to a Pythagorean triple?\n\nSuppose triangle AXD is a right triangle. Wait, but it's given as acute. So all angles less than 90\u00b0, so it can't be right. So that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sides are multiples of some known triple. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the sides of triangle AXD are m, n, 24, and R =13. Then,\n\n( m n 24 ) / (4 *\u0394 )=13.\n\nBut \u0394 is 12a (from earlier calculation). So,\n\n(m*n*24)/(4*12a)= (m n 24)/(48a) = (m n)/(2a) =13 \u2192 m n =26a.\n\nBut m = AX = sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ) = sqrt(a x ) (from Equation 1),\n\nn = XD = sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 ). Let me compute that:\n\nAs before, a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 = a x +576 -48b (from Equation 1 substitution),\n\nSo n = sqrt(a x +576 -48b )\n\nTherefore, m n = sqrt(a x ) * sqrt(a x +576 -48b ) = sqrt[ a x (a x +576 -48b ) ]\n\nBut according to the previous equation from R1, m n / (2a) =13 \u2192 sqrt[ a x (a x +576 -48b ) ] / (2a ) =13 \u2192 square both sides,\n\n[ a x (a x +576 -48b ) ] / (4a\u00b2 ) = 169 \u2192 [ x (a x +576 -48b ) ]/(4a ) =169,\n\nWait, but this seems similar to what we had before. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying to assign specific values. Let me see if I can find x such that the equations are satisfied with integer values.\n\nSince the problem is about a rectangle with integer sides (given BC=24), and the circumradii are 13 and 15, which are integers, perhaps x is also an integer. So maybe trying to find integer x between, say, 1 and 48 (since the height is 24, so the circle diameter can't be more than 48? Not sure, but let's assume x is an integer.\n\nSuppose x is an integer. Let me think of possible Pythagorean triples where the hypotenuse relates to the circumradius. Since the circumradius of a right triangle is half the hypotenuse. Wait, but our triangles are acute, so they can't be right triangles.\n\nWait, but the triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. So their circumradii can be calculated, but their sides can't form a right angle. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sides of triangle AXD are 10, 24, 26 (but 26 would be the hypotenuse, making it a right triangle, which is excluded). Alternatively, maybe 14, 48, 50? Not sure. Wait, 13 is the circumradius. For a triangle with circumradius 13, the sides must satisfy (a*b*c)/(4\u0394)=13. If it's a right triangle, then the hypotenuse would be 26, but since it's acute, perhaps the sides are all less than the hypotenuse?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle AXD has sides such that the product over the area gives 13.\n\nAlternatively, maybe trying to consider that in triangle AXD, the sides AX and XD can be expressed in terms of x and a, and given that, perhaps there is a relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps take a different approach. Since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, we can model this as coordinates with A(0,0), B(x,0), and X(a,b) such that (a, b) \u2022 (a -x, b) =0 \u2192 a(a -x) +b\u00b2=0.\n\nLet me think of this as a circle equation as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that triangles AXD and BXC have their own circumcircles with radii 13 and 15, so the circumradius formulas can be applied.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider triangle AXD. Its vertices are A(0,0), X(a,b), D(0,24). The circumradius is 13. The circumradius can also be calculated using coordinates. The formula for the circumradius in coordinates can be complex, but maybe using determinant formulas?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for any triangle with coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), the circumradius can be found by:\n\nR = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ |AB|^2 |AC|^2 |BC|^2 } }{ 4 | \\triangle ABC | }\n\nBut this might not be helpful here. Alternatively, using the formula involving coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the formula for the circumradius in terms of coordinates. The formula for the circumradius of triangle with vertices (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) is:\n\nR = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ (x2 -x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 } \\cdot \\sqrt{ (x3 -x1)^2 + (y3 - y1)^2 } \\cdot \\sqrt{ (x3 -x2)^2 + (y3 - y2)^2 } }{ 4 \\times \\text{Area} }\n\nWhich is what we used before. So maybe going back to the equations.\n\nLet me consider that both equations (from R1 and R2) involve terms with sqrt terms, which might be simplified by substitution.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote for triangle AXD:\n\nLet\u2019s define term1 = sqrt(a x) (since AX = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 ) = sqrt(a x))\n\nterm2 = sqrt(a x + 576 -48b ) (XD)\n\nThen R1 equation is (term1 * term2 )/(2a ) =13 \u2192 term1*term2 = 26a\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\nLet\u2019s denote term3 = sqrt(x(x -a)) (BX)\n\nterm4 = sqrt(x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) (XC)\n\nThen R2 equation is (term3 * term4 )/(2(x -a )) =15 \u2192 term3 * term4 =30(x -a )\n\nHmm, so:\n\nterm1 * term2 =26a \u2192 (sqrt(a x) )*(sqrt(a x +576 -48b )) =26a \u2192 squaring gives (a x)(a x +576 -48b ) = (26a )\u00b2 \u2192 a x (a x +576 -48b ) =676 a\u00b2 \u2192 divide both sides by a (assuming a \u22600):\n\nx(a x +576 -48b ) =676a \u2192 Equation C\n\nSimilarly, term3 * term4 =30(x -a )\n\nterm3 = sqrt(x(x -a)), term4 = sqrt(x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b )\n\nThus:\n\nsqrt(x(x -a )) * sqrt(x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) =30(x -a )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx(x -a )(x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) =900(x -a )\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by (x -a ), assuming x \u2260a (which is true since X is inside, so a <x ):\n\nx (x\u00b2 -a x +576 -48b ) =900(x -a )\n\n\u2192 x\u00b3 -a x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =900x -900a \u2192 Equation D\n\nNow, Equations C and D are two equations with variables x, a, b.\n\nEquation C: x(a x +576 -48b )=676a\n\nEquation D: x\u00b3 -a x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =900x -900a\n\nLet me see if I can express Equation D in terms of Equation C.\n\nFirst, let me rearrange Equation C:\n\nx(a x +576 -48b ) =676a \u2192 Let me expand left side:\n\na x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =676a \u2192 Equation C'\n\nNow, Equation D:\n\nx\u00b3 -a x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =900x -900a\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx\u00b3 -a x\u00b2 +576x -48x b -900x +900a =0\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nx\u00b3 -a x\u00b2 -324x -48x b +900a =0\n\nNow, notice that from Equation C', we have:\n\na x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =676a \u2192 so, -a x\u00b2 -576x +48x b = -676a \u2192 Let me see:\n\nLet me multiply Equation C' by (-1):\n\n- a x\u00b2 -576x +48x b = -676a \u2192 which can be substituted into the above equation.\n\nLooking back at the Equation D rearranged:\n\nx\u00b3 -a x\u00b2 -324x -48x b +900a =0\n\nWe can substitute -a x\u00b2 -48x b = (from above substitution):\n\nFrom Equation C' rearranged: -a x\u00b2 -48x b = -676a -576x +48x b? Wait, perhaps better to see:\n\nWait, the expression -a x\u00b2 -48x b is part of the equation. Let me see:\n\nFrom Equation C', we can solve for -a x\u00b2 -48x b:\n\nFrom Equation C': a x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =676a \u2192 rearranged as:\n\na x\u00b2 -48x b =676a -576x \u2192 so, -a x\u00b2 +48x b = -676a +576x \u2192 Hmm, not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me see the terms in Equation D:\n\nx\u00b3 -a x\u00b2 -324x -48x b +900a =0\n\nWe can group terms as:\n\nx\u00b3 + ( -a x\u00b2 -48x b ) + (-324x +900a ) =0\n\nFrom Equation C', we have:\n\na x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =676a \u2192 so, -a x\u00b2 -48x b = -676a -576x\n\nTherefore, substitute into the first group:\n\nx\u00b3 + (-676a -576x ) + (-324x +900a ) =0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b3 -676a -576x -324x +900a =0 \u2192 x\u00b3 + ( -676a +900a ) + ( -576x -324x ) =0\n\nWhich is:\n\nx\u00b3 +224a -900x =0 \u2192 x\u00b3 -900x +224a =0 \u2192 Equation E\n\nSo now, Equation E relates x and a: x\u00b3 -900x +224a =0 \u2192 224a = -x\u00b3 +900x \u2192 a = ( -x\u00b3 +900x ) /224 \u2192 a = x(900 -x\u00b2 ) /224 \u2192 Equation F\n\nNow, Equation C' was:\n\na x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =676a \u2192 let's try to solve for b.\n\nLet me rearrange Equation C':\n\n-48x b =676a -a x\u00b2 -576x \u2192 divide both sides by -48x:\n\nb = [ a x\u00b2 +576x -676a ] / (48x )\n\nSo,\n\nb = [ a(x\u00b2 -676) +576x ] / (48x )\n\nHmm, perhaps substitute a from Equation F into this expression.\n\nFrom Equation F, a = x(900 -x\u00b2)/224\n\nPlugging into b:\n\nb = [ (x(900 -x\u00b2)/224)(x\u00b2 -676) +576x ] / (48x )\n\nFirst, compute numerator:\n\nFirst term inside first bracket:\n\nx(900 -x\u00b2)/224 * (x\u00b2 -676 )\n\nLet me note that x\u00b2 -676 = (x - 26)(x +26 )\n\nBut maybe expanding:\n\n(x(900 -x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 -676 )) /224 +576x\n\nThus, numerator:\n\n[ x(900 -x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 -676 ) +576x *224 ] /224\n\nThen divide by 48x:\n\nSo,\n\nb = [ x(900 -x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 -676 ) +576x*224 ] / [224 *48x ]\n\nSimplify denominators:\n\n224 *48 = 10752\n\nSo,\n\nb = [ x(...) + ... ] / (10752x )\n\nCancel x:\n\nb = [ (900 -x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 -676 ) +576*224 ] /10752\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\nFirst term: (900 -x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 -676 )\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n900x\u00b2 -900*676 -x^4 +676x\u00b2 = (900x\u00b2 +676x\u00b2 ) -x^4 -900*676 = 1576x\u00b2 -x^4 - 608,400\n\nSecond term:576*224 = let's compute that:\n\n576*200=115,200; 576*24=13,824 \u2192 total 115,200 +13,824 =129,024\n\nTherefore, numerator:\n\n1576x\u00b2 -x^4 -608,400 +129,024 =1576x\u00b2 -x^4 - (608,400 -129,024 )\n\nCompute 608,400 -129,024:\n\n608,400 -100,000=508,400\n\n508,400 -29,024=479,376\n\nThus, numerator becomes:\n\n- x^4 +1576x\u00b2 -479,376\n\nThus,\n\nb = [ -x^4 +1576x\u00b2 -479,376 ] /10752\n\nHmm, that seems very complicated, but perhaps this can lead us somewhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of substituting into b, perhaps we can find another relation.\n\nLet me recall that from Equation 1:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x \u2192 we can use this to form another equation.\n\nWe have a = [x(900 -x\u00b2)]/224 from Equation F. Let me denote this as a = A(x).\n\nThen, we can write b\u00b2 = a x -a\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute b\u00b2 using the expression for a:\n\nb\u00b2 = a x -a\u00b2 = a(x -a )\n\nSubstitute a = x(900 -x\u00b2)/224,\n\nb\u00b2 = [x(900 -x\u00b2)/224 ] * [x -x(900 -x\u00b2)/224 ]\n\n= [x(900 -x\u00b2)/224] * [ x(1 - (900 -x\u00b2)/224 ) ]\n\nLet me compute the second bracket:\n\n1 - (900 -x\u00b2)/224 = (224 -900 +x\u00b2)/224 = (x\u00b2 -676)/224\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2 = [x(900 -x\u00b2)/224 ] * [ x(x\u00b2 -676)/224 ]\n\n= x^2 (900 -x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 -676 ) / (224)^2\n\nTherefore, b\u00b2 = [x\u00b2 (900 -x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 -676 ) ] / (224)^2\n\nBut from earlier, we had an expression for b in terms of x, which when squared would give this. However, this might not be helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps equate this expression for b\u00b2 with the expression from Equation C'?\n\nWait, from Equation C':\n\na x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =676a \u2192 we can solve for b:\n\n48x b = a x\u00b2 +576x -676a \u2192 b = [a x\u00b2 +576x -676a ]/(48x )\n\nTherefore, squaring both sides,\n\nb\u00b2 = [ (a x\u00b2 +576x -676a )^2 ] / (48x )\u00b2\n\nSet equal to previous expression:\n\n[x\u00b2 (900 -x\u00b2)(x\u00b2 -676 ) ] / (224)^2 = [ (a x\u00b2 +576x -676a )^2 ] / (48x )\u00b2\n\nBut this seems even more complex. Perhaps this approach is not leading anywhere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can substitute a from Equation F into Equation E.\n\nWait, Equation E is x\u00b3 -900x +224a =0, and a is expressed in terms of x.\n\nWait, actually Equation F comes from Equation E, so substituting a from F into another equation would lead to a tautology. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look for an integer x such that Equation F gives a rational a, and then check if other equations hold.\n\nGiven that x is the length AB, likely an integer, let me try possible x values.\n\nLet me think of possible x values. Since BC is 24, and the rectangle's sides are AB and BC, so AB can be any positive number, but given the circumradii 13 and 15, perhaps x is around that scale.\n\nLet me try x=25. Let me see.\n\nSuppose x=25.\n\nThen from Equation F:\n\na =25*(900 -25\u00b2)/224 =25*(900 -625)/224 =25*(275)/224 = (6875)/224 \u224830.7, but x is 25, so a cannot be more than x. So this is invalid. So discard x=25.\n\nNext, try x= 26.\n\na =26*(900 -26\u00b2)/224 =26*(900 -676)/224 =26*(224)/224=26*1=26. So a=26.\n\nBut x=26, so a=26, but a must be less than x, but here a=26 and x=26, so that's on the edge, but X would be at (26, b), but since it's inside, a must be less than x. So x=26 might be possible?\n\nWait, but then a=26 would be at the boundary. Maybe not. Let me check.\n\nIf x=26 and a=26, then from Equation 1:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =a x \u2192 26\u00b2 +b\u00b2=26*26 \u2192 b\u00b2=0 \u2192 b=0, but then point X would be at (26,0), which is point B. But it's supposed to be inside the rectangle. So invalid. So x=26 is invalid.\n\nNext, try x=24.\n\nThen a=24*(900 -24\u00b2)/224 =24*(900 -576)/224 =24*(324)/224\n\n24/224 = 3/28, so 3/28 *324 = (972)/28 \u224834.714. But x=24, so a\u224834.714>24, invalid.\n\nx= 20.\n\na=20*(900 -400)/224=20*500/224=10000/224\u224844.64>20. No good.\n\nHmm, maybe x= 30?\n\na=30*(900 -900)/224= 0. So a=0, but that's point A. Not inside.\n\nHmm, negative?\n\nWait, when does a become less than x?\n\nLet me see when the numerator x(900 -x\u00b2 ) is positive?\n\nSince a must be positive, so numerator x(900 -x\u00b2 ) must be positive.\n\nSince x is positive (length), so 900 -x\u00b2 >0 \u2192 x\u00b2 <900 \u2192 x <30.\n\nTherefore, x must be less than 30.\n\nSo possible x values less than 30.\n\nLet me try x= 20: which we saw a\u224844.64>20, invalid.\n\nx=15:\n\na=15*(900 -225)/224=15*675/224=10125/224\u224845.2, still larger than 15.\n\nHmm, not good.\n\nWait, x= 25 was over 30, but x must be less than 30. Wait, x=25 is less than 30.\n\nWait x=25:\n\na=25*(900 -625)/224=25*275/224\u224830.7>25, which is invalid.\n\nHmm, what's wrong here? Maybe the approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my Equation F is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me retrace steps to see if I made an error.\n\nWe had Equation E: x\u00b3 -900x +224a =0 \u2192 so 224a = -x\u00b3 +900x \u2192 a = ( -x\u00b3 +900x ) /224 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus, for a to be positive, numerator must be positive:\n\n- x\u00b3 +900x >0 \u2192 x(-x\u00b2 +900 )>0 \u2192 since x>0, then -x\u00b2 +900 >0 \u2192x\u00b2 <900 \u2192 x<30, which aligns with above.\n\nSo a is positive as long as x<30.\n\nBut for a to be less than x, we need:\n\n( -x\u00b3 +900x ) /224 <x \u2192 -x\u00b3 +900x <224x \u2192 -x\u00b3 +676x <0 \u2192 x(-x\u00b2 +676 ) <0 \u2192 since x>0,\n\nthen -x\u00b2 +676 <0 \u2192x\u00b2>676 \u2192x>26.\n\nThus, a <x when x>26.\n\nTherefore, x must be between 26 and 30.\n\nSo possible integer x values are 27, 28, 29.\n\nLet me try x=28.\n\nThen a = ( -28\u00b3 +900*28 ) /224\n\nFirst compute 28\u00b3=28*28*28=28*784=21,952\n\n900*28=25,200\n\nThus numerator: -21,952 +25,200=3,248\n\nTherefore a=3,248 /224= let's divide 3248 by 224:\n\n224*14=3,136 \u2192 3,248-3,136=112 \u2192 14 +112/224=14.5\n\nThus a=14.5=29/2.\n\nSo a=14.5, which is less than x=28. Good.\n\nNow let's compute b using Equation C':\n\nFrom Equation C':\n\na x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =676a\n\nSubstitute a=14.5, x=28:\n\n14.5*(28)^2 +576*28 -48*28*b =676*14.5\n\nCompute each term:\n\n14.5*(784)=14.5*700=10,150; 14.5*84=1,218 \u2192 total 10,150+1,218=11,368\n\n576*28= 16,128\n\n676*14.5: 676*10=6,760; 676*4=2,704; 676*0.5=338 \u2192 total 6,760+2,704=9,464 +338=9,802\n\nThus:\n\n11,368 +16,128 -48*28*b =9,802\n\nTotal of first two terms: 11,368+16,128=27,496\n\nThus:\n\n27,496 -48*28*b =9,802 \u2192 27,496 -9,802 =48*28*b \u2192 17,694 =1,344*b \u2192 b=17,694 /1,344\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 2,949 /224 \u224813.16.

Hmm, discrepancy. Not equal.

Correct.\n\n676*14.5:\n\n676*10=6,760; 676*4=2,704; 676*0.5=338 \u2192 total 6,760+2,704=9,464 +338=9,802. Correct.\n\nSo 11,368 +16,128=27,496 \u2192 27,496 -9,802=17,694. Correct.\n\n17,694 divided by (48*28)=1,344 \u2192 17,694/1,344.\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by 6: 17,694 \u00f76=2,949; 1,344 \u00f76=224\n\n2,949 divided by 224:\n\n224*13=2,912, so 2,949-2,912=37 \u2192 so yes, 13 and 37/224 \u224813.165.\n\nThen a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 should equal a x=14.5*28=406.\n\nCompute a\u00b2 +b\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2= (29/2)^2=841/4=210.25\n\nb= (17,694/1,344)= (2,949/224)= let's see:\n\n2,949 divided by224:\n\n224*13=2,912 \u2192 remainder 37 \u2192 so b=13 +37/224 \u2192 squared:\n\n(13 + 37/224)^2=13\u00b2 +2*13*(37/224)+(37/224)^2=169 + (962)/224 + (1,369)/ (224)^2\n\nCompute 962/224=4.294...\n\nApproximate:\n\nTotal b\u00b2\u2248169 +4.294 +0.0027\u2248173.296\n\nThus a\u00b2 +b\u00b2\u2248210.25 +173.296\u2248383.55, which is not equal to 406. So discrepancy here indicates that with x=28, a=14.5 and b\u224813.165, the equation a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 = a x is not satisfied.\n\nHmm, so something is wrong here. I must have made a mistake in the derivation.\n\nWait, Equation C' comes from Equation C, which came from the R1 equation. So if there is an error here.\n\nWait, let me check the steps again.\n\nEquation C was derived from the R1 equation:\n\nAfter squaring the R1 equation, we had:\n\n[ a x (a x +576 -48b ) ] = (26a )\u00b2 \u2192 a x (a x +576 -48b ) = 676a\u00b2 \u2192 dividing both sides by a gives x(a x +576 -48b ) =676a \u2192 which is Equation C.\n\nYes, that is correct.\n\nThen in Equation D, which came from the R2 equation after substitution, we ended up with Equation E: x\u00b3 -900x +224a =0.\n\nSo Equation E is correct.\n\nThus, with x=28, a=14.5, this gives:\n\n28\u00b3 -900*28 +224*14.5 \u2192 21,952 -25,200 +3,248 = (21,952 +3,248 ) -25,200 =25,200 -25,200 =0 \u2192 Correct. So Equation E holds.\n\nBut then why does a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 \u2260a x?\n\nWait, because Equation 1 is supposed to hold (since angle AXB is 90\u00b0), but in this case it doesn't. So there must be an error in another step.\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating b? Because from Equation C', we have:\n\na x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =676a \u2192 solving for b gives:\n\n-48x b =676a -a x\u00b2 -576x \u2192 so,\n\nb = [a x\u00b2 +576x -676a ]/(48x )\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, -48x b =676a -a x\u00b2 -576x \u2192 so,\n\nb = (a x\u00b2 +576x -676a ) / (-48x )\n\nWait, I think I missed a negative sign earlier.\n\nWait, let me re-derive:\n\nFrom Equation C':\n\na x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =676a \u2192 move terms with b to left and others to right:\n\n-48x b =676a -a x\u00b2 -576x \u2192 thus,\n\nb = [a x\u00b2 +576x -676a ] / (48x )\n\nWait no, the right-hand side is 676a -a x\u00b2 -576x \u2192 so,\n\n-48x b = (676a -a x\u00b2 -576x )\n\nThus,\n\nb = [a x\u00b2 +576x -676a ]/( -48x )\n\nWait, so the numerator is a x\u00b2 +576x -676a, and denominator is -48x \u2192 so,\n\nb = [ - (a x\u00b2 +576x -676a ) ] / (48x )\n\nTherefore,\n\nb = [ -a x\u00b2 -576x +676a ] / (48x )\n\nAh! I missed the negative sign earlier. That's the mistake.\n\nSo, correcting this:\n\nb = [ -a x\u00b2 -576x +676a ] / (48x )\n\nLet me recompute for x=28, a=14.5:\n\nNumerator:\n\n-14.5*(28)^2 -576*28 +676*14.5\n\nFirst term: -14.5*(784)= -11,368\n\nSecond term: -576*28= -16,128\n\nThird term:+676*14.5=+9,802 (from before)\n\nTotal numerator: -11,368 -16,128 +9,802 = (-27,496) +9,802 = -17,694\n\nDenominator:48*28=1,344\n\nThus,\n\nb= -17,694 /1,344 \u2192 but that's negative. But b is a coordinate between 0 and24. So this gives negative b, which is impossible. Hence, contradiction.\n\nHmm, so that can\u2019t be. So something is wrong here.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in sign during derivation.\n\nWait in Equation C':\n\nOriginal equation from R1 squared was:\n\nx(a x +576 -48b ) =676a \u2192 that's correct.\n\nBut when moving terms to solve for b:\n\na x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =676a \u2192 then,\n\n-48x b =676a -a x\u00b2 -576x \u2192 so,\n\nb = (a x\u00b2 +576x -676a ) / ( -48x )\n\nWait, yes, so numerator is a x\u00b2 +576x -676a, and denominator is -48x \u2192 so,\n\nb = [ - (a x\u00b2 +576x -676a ) ] / (48x )\n\nThus,\n\nb = [ -a x\u00b2 -576x +676a ] / (48x )\n\nTherefore, with x=28 and a=14.5,\n\nNumerator:\n\n-14.5*(28)^2 -576*28 +676*(14.5)\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n-14.5*784 = -14.5*700 -14.5*84 = -10,150 -1,218 = -11,368\n\n-576*28 = -16,128\n\n+676*14.5=+9,802\n\nTotal numerator:\n\n-11,368 -16,128 +9,802 = (-27,496) +9,802 = -17,694\n\nThus,\n\nb = -17,694 / (48*28) = -17,694 /1,344 \u2248-13.165\n\nNegative b, which is impossible. So this suggests that with x=28, the solution gives negative b, which is invalid. Hence x=28 is invalid.\n\nHmm, so this approach is leading to a problem.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign during substitution. Let me check the R1 equation again.\n\nWait, in the beginning, when setting up the equation for R1:\n\nThe area of triangle AXD is 12a.\n\nThe sides are AX, XD, and AD (24). So the formula for circumradius R1 is (AX * XD * AD)/(4 * area).\n\nPlugging in:\n\nAX = sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 )\n\nXD = sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 )\n\nAD=24\n\nArea=12a.\n\nThus,\n\nR1 = ( sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2)*sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 )*24 ) / (4*12a )\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThen simplifying:\n\n24/(4*12a ) =24/(48a ) =1/(2a )\n\nThus,\n\nR1= [ sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2)*sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 ) ]/(2a )\n\nWhich was squared to:\n\n[ (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2)*(a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 ) ]/(4a\u00b2 ) =13\u00b2=169\n\nBut wait, in my earlier steps, I substituted a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x from Equation1, leading to:\n\nsqrt(a x )*sqrt(a x +576 -48b )\n\nBut when I squared the terms:\n\n[ sqrt(a x )*sqrt(a x +576 -48b ) ]\u00b2 =a x (a x +576 -48b )\n\nThus, the equation is:\n\na x (a x +576 -48b ) = (2a *13 )\u00b2 \u2192 2a *13=26a? Wait no:\n\nWait, R1=13= [ sqrt(a x)* sqrt(...) ]/(2a ), so squared:\n\n( a x (a x + ...) )/(4a\u00b2 )=169 \u2192 numerator over denominator:\n\n(a x (a x + ... )) / (4a\u00b2 ) = (x (a x + ...) )/(4a )=169 \u2192 thus,\n\nx (a x +576 -48b ) = 676a \u2192 which is Equation C.\n\nYes, that is correct.\n\nTherefore, when solving for b, the negative result indicates inconsistency, meaning that x=28 is not a solution. Hmm.\n\nProceed to next possible integer, x=27.\n\nLet me try x=27:\n\nCompute a:\n\na=( -27\u00b3 +900*27 )/224\n\n27\u00b3=27*27*27=19,683\n\n900*27=24,300\n\nNumerator: -19,683+24,300=4,617\n\nThus a=4,617/224\u224820.61\n\nCheck a<x? 20.61<27: yes.\n\nNow compute b using Equation C':\n\nb = [ -a x\u00b2 -576x +676a ]/(48x )\n\nPlugging in x=27, a\u224820.61:\n\nFirst, compute numerator:\n\n- a x\u00b2 = -20.61*(27)^2\n\n27\u00b2=729 \u2192 -20.61*729\u2248-20.61*700= -14,427; -20.61*29\u2248-597.69 \u2192 total \u2248-14,427-597.69\u2248-15,024.69\n\n-576x =-576*27= -15,552\n\n+676a =676*20.61\u2248676*20=13,520 +676*0.61\u2248412.36 \u2192 total\u224813,520+412.36\u224813,932.36\n\nTotal numerator:\n\n-15,024.69 -15,552 +13,932.36\u2248 (-30,576.69) +13,932.36\u2248-16,644.33\n\nDenominator:48*27=1,296\n\nThus, b\u2248-16,644.33 /1,296\u2248-12.84.\n\nAgain negative, which is invalid.

That can't be. So perhaps my approach has an error.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, both triangles AXD and BXC are acute. If b is negative, then point X would be below the x-axis, which is outside the rectangle since the rectangle is from y=0 to y=24. So that's impossible. Thus, our approach must be wrong.\n\nAlternative thought: perhaps my substitution made a mistake in the sign when solving for b.\n\nWait, let me re-express Equation C':\n\nWe have from Equation C:\n\nx(a x +576 -48b )=676a \u2192 rearranged:\n\na x\u00b2 +576x -48x b=676a \u2192 bringing all terms to left:\n\na x\u00b2 -676a +576x -48x b=0 \u2192 factor a:\n\na(x\u00b2 -676 ) +576x -48x b =0 \u2192 so,\n\na(x\u00b2 -676 ) =48x b -576x \u2192 a(x\u00b2 -676 ) =48x (b -12 )\n\nHmm, maybe this form is better.\n\nAlternatively, solving for b:\n\nFrom a x\u00b2 +576x -48x b =676a \u2192 rearrange:\n\n-48x b =676a -a x\u00b2 -576x \u2192 divide both sides by -48x:\n\nb = (a x\u00b2 +576x -676a )/( -48x )\n\n= [ - (a x\u00b2 -576x +676a ) ] / (48x )\n\nWait, but this still gives the same result.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that with x between 26 and30, the term a x\u00b2 -576x +676a is positive, leading to negative b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in the equation derivation.\n\nWait, let me take a step back.\n\nLet me consider that the problem states that both triangles AXD and BXC are acute. So their angles must all be less than 90\u00b0, which might impose additional constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach using coordinate geometry and the properties of circles.\n\nLet me consider the coordinates again:\n\nA(0,0), B(x,0), C(x,24), D(0,24), and X(a,b).\n\nGiven angle AXB=90\u00b0, so X lies on the circle with diameter AB: (a -x/2)^2 + b\u00b2 = (x/2)^2 \u2192 simplifies to a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =a x, which is Equation 1.\n\nFor triangle AXD being acute:\n\nAll angles in AXD are less than 90\u00b0, so for example, the square of each side must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSo:\n\nAX\u00b2 < XD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2,\n\nXD\u00b2 < AX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2,\n\nAD\u00b2 < AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2.\n\nCompute each:\n\nAX\u00b2 =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2,\n\nXD\u00b2 =a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2,\n\nAD\u00b2 =24\u00b2=576.\n\nFirst inequality:\n\nAX\u00b2 < XD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 \u2192 a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 < [a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 ] +576.\n\nSimplify:\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2\n\nRight side: a\u00b2 + (24\u00b2 -48b +b\u00b2 ) +576 =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 + 576 -48b +576 =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 + 1152 -48b.\n\nThus inequality:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 < a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +1152 -48b \u2192 0 <1152 -48b \u219248b <1152 \u2192b <24 \u2192 which is true since b<24 in the rectangle.\n\nSecond inequality:\n\nXD\u00b2 < AX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 \u2192 [a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 ] < [a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ] +576.\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 +576 -48b +b\u00b2\n\nRight side: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +576.\n\nSubtract left from right:\n\n(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +576) - (a\u00b2 +576 -48b +b\u00b2 )=48b >0 \u2192 so inequality holds as long as b>0, which it is.\n\nThird inequality:\n\nAD\u00b2 < AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 \u2192576 < [a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 ] +[a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 ]\n\nCompute right side:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +a\u00b2 +576 -48b +b\u00b2 =2a\u00b2 +2b\u00b2 -48b +576\n\nThus:\n\n576 <2a\u00b2 +2b\u00b2 -48b +576 \u2192 subtract 576:\n\n0 < 2a\u00b2 +2b\u00b2 -48b \u2192 divide by 2:\n\n0 <a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -24b \u2192 a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -24b >0 \u2192 from Equation 1, a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x \u2192 substitute:\n\na x -24b >0 \u2192 a x >24b \u2192 b < (a x)/24.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC being acute:\n\nSimilarly, the inequalities would give conditions.\n\nBut maybe this can help in forming inequalities.\n\nFrom triangle AXD's third inequality: b < (a x)/24.\n\nFrom triangle BXC's similar conditions:\n\nLet me consider triangle BXC with sides BX, XC, BC.\n\nBX\u00b2 = (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2,\n\nXC\u00b2=(x -a)^2 + (24 -b)^2,\n\nBC\u00b2=576.\n\nThe inequalities for BXC being acute:\n\nBX\u00b2 < XC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 \u2192 (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 < [ (x -a)^2 + (24 -b)^2 ] +576.\n\nLeft side: (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2,\n\nRight side: (x -a)^2 + (24\u00b2 -48b +b\u00b2 ) +576 \u2192 (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 + 576 -48b +576 \u2192 (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 +1152 -48b.\n\nThus inequality:\n\n(x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 < (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 +1152 -48b \u2192 0 <1152 -48b \u2192 same as before, b <24.\n\nAnother inequality:\n\nXC\u00b2 < BX\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 \u2192 [ (x -a)^2 + (24 -b)^2 ] < [ (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 ] +576.\n\nLeft side: (x -a)^2 +576 -48b +b\u00b2,\n\nRight side: (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 +576.\n\nSubtract left from right: 48b >0 \u2192 b>0.\n\nThird inequality:\n\nBC\u00b2 < BX\u00b2 + XC\u00b2 \u2192576 < [ (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 ] + [ (x -a)^2 + (24 -b)^2 ]\n\nCompute right side:\n\n2(x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 =2(x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 +576 -48b +b\u00b2 =2(x -a)^2 +2b\u00b2 -48b +576\n\nThus,\n\n576 <2(x -a)^2 +2b\u00b2 -48b +576 \u21920 <2(x -a)^2 +2b\u00b2 -48b \u2192 divide by 2:\n\n0 < (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 -24b \u2192 (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 -24b>0 \u2192 from Equation 1, (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 =x\u00b2 -2a x +a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =x\u00b2 -2a x +a x (from Equation1: a x =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 \u2192x\u00b2 -a x +a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -a x +a x?

Let me try with x= 48:\n\nBut as above, gives a negative.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier equation.\n\nWait, when I derived x= (394/225)a,\n\nAnd b= (13/15)a,\n\nThen coordinates are a, b, which must satisfy 0 <a <x and 0 <b <24,\n\nThus,\n\na <x \u2192 a < (394/225)a \u2192 1 <394/225 \u2192 which is true since394/225\u22481.75,\n\nThus, possible.\n\nAlso, b= (13/15)a <24 \u2192 a < (24*15)/13\u224827.69.\n\nThus a is up to ~27.69,\n\nThus, x= (394/225)a \u22481.75*a, so x up to ~48.\n\nThus, possible x up to ~48.\n\nNow, let me assume that the quadratic equation solution gives a=225/ something.\n\nLet me consider the quadratic equation:\n\n155,236 a\u00b2 -3,687,840 a +16,704,900 =0,\n\nLet me divide all terms by 4 to get:\n\n38,809 a\u00b2 -921,960 a +4,176,225 =0,\n\nLet me see if 38,809 divides into the constant term:\n\n4,176,225 \u00f738,809 \u2248107.6,\n\nBut 38,809\u00d7107= 38,809\u00d7100=3,880,900 +38,809\u00d77=271,663 \u2192 total3,880,900+271,663=4,152,563,\n\nSubtract from4,176,225:4,176,225-4,152,563=23,662,\n\nNot exact.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires recognizing that the two circumradii are 13 and15, which are 5-12-13 and9-12-15 triples scaled.\n\nPerhaps the triangles AXD and BXC have sides related to these triples.\n\nSuppose triangle AXD is a 5-12-13 scaled by factor k:\n\nThus sides would be 5k,12k,13k,\n\nCircumradius R=13= (5k\u00d712k\u00d713k)/(4\u00d7Area),\n\nArea= (5k\u00d712k)/2=30k\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n13= (780k\u00b3)/(120k\u00b2)= (780k)/120=6.5k,\n\nThus 6.5k=13 \u2192k=2.\n\nThus sides are 10,24,26. But AD is 24, which is one side.\n\nThus, if AXD has sides 10,24,26, then AD=24, so that would fit.\n\nThus:\n\nAX=10,\n\nXD=26,\n\nAD=24,\n\nWhich would mean that in the rectangle:\n\nAX=10= sqrt(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2),\n\nXD=26= sqrt(a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2),\n\nAD=24.\n\nThus,\n\nFrom AX=10: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2=100,\n\nFrom XD=26: a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2=676,\n\nSubtract first equation from second:\n\n(24 -b)^2 -b\u00b2=676-100=576,\n\nExpand:24\u00b2 -48b +b\u00b2 -b\u00b2=576,\n\n576-48b=576,\n\nThus,\n\n-48b=0 \u2192b=0.\n\nBut then point X would be at (a,0), but angle AXB would be 90\u00b0, but if b=0, then X is on AB, but the problem states it's inside the rectangle. So invalid.\n\nThus, this approach is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, triangle AXD could be a different triangle with R=13.\n\nSuppose triangle AXD has sides 25, 26, sqrt(25\u00b2+26\u00b2) but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe triangle AXD has sides AX=26, XD=20, AD=24.\n\nThen, R= (26\u00d720\u00d724)/(4\u00d7Area),\n\nArea= (26\u00d720)/2=260,\n\nThus,\n\nR= (26\u00d720\u00d724)/(4\u00d7260)= (12,480)/(1,040)=12, which is not 13.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, if AX=25, XD= sqrt(25\u00b2 +24\u00b2)=sqrt(625+576)=sqrt(1201), AD=24,\n\nThen R= (25\u00d7sqrt(1201)\u00d724)/(4\u00d7Area). Area would be \u00bd*24*height, but not sure.\n\nThis approach seems unproductive.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 48. Let me see.\n\nWait, let me consider that the coordinates of X must satisfy angle AXB=90\u00b0, so (a, b) on circle with diameter AB, so a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x,\n\nAnd the triangles AXD and BXC have circumradii 13 and15.\n\nPerhaps the problem is symmetrical when AB= 48, but earlier substitution gave negative b.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is 48.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation.\n\nLet me try to substitute x= 48 into the earlier equation:\n\nFrom Equation5: x= (394/225)a,\n\nThus a= (225/394)x,\n\nIf x=48,\n\na= (225/394)*48\u224827.69,\n\nb=13/15 *a\u224813/15*27.69\u224823.4,\n\nCheck Equation3':\n\nx*(a\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2 ) should equal676a,\n\nCompute:\n\na\u00b2=27.69\u00b2\u2248767,\n\n(24 -23.4)=0.6 \u2192 squared is0.36,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 + (24 -b )\u00b2\u2248767+0.36\u2248767.36,\n\nMultiply by x=48:\u224848\u00d7767.36\u224836,833,\n\nRight side:676a\u2248676\u00d727.69\u224818,250,\n\nNot equal.\n\nThus, not valid.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 25?

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem step by step. So, we have a rectangle ABCD where BC is 24 units long. There's a point X inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Additionally, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, and their circumradii are 13 and 15 respectively. We need to find the length of AB, which is one of the sides of the rectangle. \n\nFirst, let me draw a rough sketch of the rectangle to visualize the problem. Let me label the rectangle with vertices A, B, C, D in order, so that AB and CD are the lengths we need to find (since BC is given as 24, which would be the height). Point X is somewhere inside the rectangle, forming a right angle at X between points A and B. Also, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, which probably means that their angles are all less than 90 degrees. The circumradii of these triangles are given as 13 and 15, respectively. \n\nHmm, okay. Since we're dealing with circumradii of triangles, I remember that the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area of the triangle. Alternatively, for a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse, but in this case, triangles AXD and BXC aren't necessarily right-angled. Wait, but angle AXB is 90 degrees, so maybe that can help us?\n\nLet me note down the given information more formally:\n\n- ABCD is a rectangle with BC = 24. So, BC is one of the sides, which in a rectangle are equal to AD and BC. Since ABCD is a rectangle, AB and CD are the other pair of sides, which are equal. Let me denote AB as the length we need to find, let's call it x. Therefore, AB = CD = x, and BC = AD = 24.\n\n- Point X is inside the rectangle such that angle AXB = 90\u00b0. So, triangle AXB is a right-angled triangle at X.\n\n- Triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. So, all their angles are less than 90\u00b0, which might impose some constraints on the position of X.\n\n- The circumradius of triangle AXD is 13, and that of BXC is 15.\n\nOur goal is to find AB = x.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can set up coordinate axes here to model the problem. Let me place the rectangle in a coordinate system where point A is at the origin (0,0). Then, since AB is horizontal, point B would be at (x, 0). Since BC is vertical and of length 24, point C is at (x, 24), and point D is at (0,24). \n\nTherefore, coordinates:\n\n- A: (0,0)\n\n- B: (x,0)\n\n- C: (x,24)\n\n- D: (0,24)\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, so its coordinates can be represented as (a,b) where 0 < a < x and 0 < b < 24.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, which geometrically means that vectors XA and XB are perpendicular. Let me verify this. The vectors from X to A and to B would be:\n\nXA = (a - 0, b - 0) = (a, b)\n\nXB = (x - a, -b)\n\nTheir dot product should be zero:\n\nXA \u2022 XB = a*(x - a) + b*(-b) = a(x - a) - b\u00b2 = 0\n\nSo, that gives us the equation:\n\na(x - a) - b\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 ax - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 0 \u2192 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = ax.\n\nThat's one equation from the right angle at X between A and B.\n\nNow, moving on to triangles AXD and BXC.\n\nFirst, let's consider triangle AXD. Its vertices are A(0,0), X(a,b), D(0,24). Let's find its sides:\n\n- AX: distance from A to X: \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\n- XD: distance from X to D: \u221a[(0 - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2] = \u221a(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2)\n\n- AD: distance from A to D: 24 (since it's the side of the rectangle). Wait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, but in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD?\n\nWait, actually, triangle AXD is formed by points A, X, D. So the three sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, so that's fixed at 24. Hmm, but the triangle AXD's sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, but AD is a side between A and D, so yes, that's part of the triangle. However, in triangle AXD, the three sides would be AX, XD, and AD. Wait, but AD is 24, so if we consider triangle AXD, sides are AX, XD, and AD. However, AD is fixed as 24, but the other sides depend on X's position. \n\nSimilarly, triangle BXC has vertices B(x,0), X(a,b), C(x,24). So sides are BX, XC, and BC (which is 24). The sides would be:\n\n- BX: distance from B to X: \u221a[(x - a)^2 + b\u00b2]\n\n- XC: distance from X to C: \u221a[(x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2]\n\n- BC: 24.\n\nWait, but BC is the side of the rectangle, so again, that's fixed. So triangles AXD and BXC each have one side fixed (AD and BC, both 24), and the other sides depend on X's position.\n\nGiven that both triangles are acute, so all angles in both triangles must be less than 90\u00b0. \n\nThe problem also mentions the circumradii of these triangles: 13 for AXD and 15 for BXC.\n\nSo, perhaps I can use the formula for the circumradius of a triangle. Let me recall that the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides of length a, b, c is R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where \u0394 is the area of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, another formula is R = a/(2*sin A), where A is the angle opposite side a. But since the triangles are acute, all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so sine of each angle is positive and less than 1, so the circumradius would be greater than half the length of the side opposite the angle. Hmm, not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use coordinates to set up equations for the circumradius.\n\nFirst, let's handle triangle AXD. Let me denote the sides of triangle AXD as follows:\n\nLet me denote sides as:\n\n- AX: length \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\n- XD: \u221a[a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2]\n\n- AD: 24\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\n- BX: \u221a[(x - a)^2 + b\u00b2]\n\n- XC: \u221a[(x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2]\n\n- BC: 24\n\nSo, for triangle AXD, its sides are AX, XD, and AD. Let me denote them as:\n\nLet\u2019s name the sides of triangle AXD as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- Side opposite angle at A: XD. Wait, actually, angles in triangle AXD are at points A, X, D.\n\nWait, maybe better to use standard notation where sides are opposite the angles. Let me think. Let me denote the triangle AXD, with vertices at A(0,0), X(a,b), D(0,24). Let me denote the sides as:\n\n- a1: length opposite angle at A (which is XD, between X and D) \u2192 \u221a[a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2]\n\n- b1: length opposite angle at X (which is AD, between A and D) \u2192 24\n\n- c1: length opposite angle at D (which is AX, between A and X) \u2192 \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\nBut maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me instead just use the sides as AX, XD, AD, and apply the circumradius formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates to compute the circumradius?\n\nAlternatively, since triangle AXD has coordinates A(0,0), X(a,b), D(0,24). The circumradius can be found using the formula for the circumradius given coordinates. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for three points. The formula for the circumradius of three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) is |(AB \u00d7 AC)|/(4\u0394), but maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to use the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394). Let me try that.\n\nSo for triangle AXD:\n\nLet me compute the lengths:\n\nAX = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\nXD = \u221a[a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2]\n\nAD = 24\n\nSo, sides are AX, XD, AD. Let me denote them as:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say for triangle AXD, the sides are:\n\nLet\u2019s say, let\u2019s call the sides:\n\ns1 = AX = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\ns2 = XD = \u221a[a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2]\n\ns3 = AD = 24\n\nThen, the area \u0394 of triangle AXD can be calculated using coordinates. Since A, X, D are points (0,0), (a,b), (0,24). The area can be found via the determinant formula:\n\n\u0394 = (1/2)*| (0*(b - 24) + a*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - b) ) | = (1/2)*| 0 + 24a + 0 | = (1/2)*24a = 12a.\n\nSo the area is 12a.\n\nTherefore, the circumradius R1 of triangle AXD is (s1*s2*s3)/(4*\u0394) = (AX * XD * 24)/(4*12a) ) = (AX * XD * 24)/(48a) ) = (AX * XD)/(2a)\n\nGiven that R1 is 13, so:\n\n(AX * XD)/(2a) = 13 \u2192 AX * XD = 26a\n\nSimilarly, let's compute AX and XD in terms of a and b:\n\nAX = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\nXD = \u221a(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nTherefore, AX * XD = \u221a[ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2) ]\n\nTherefore, \u221a[ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2) ] = 26a\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) = (26a)^2 = 676a\u00b2\n\nHmm, that's one equation. Let me note this as equation (1).\n\nSimilarly, let's handle triangle BXC. Let me do the same steps for triangle BXC.\n\nTriangle BXC has vertices B(x,0), X(a,b), C(x,24). Let's compute its sides:\n\nBX = \u221a[(x - a)^2 + b\u00b2]\n\nXC = \u221a[(x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2]\n\nBC = 24\n\nSimilarly, the area \u0394 of triangle BXC can be found using the determinant:\n\nCoordinates: B(x,0), X(a,b), C(x,24). \n\nArea \u0394 = (1/2)*| x*(b - 24) + a*(24 - 0) + x*(0 - b) | \n\nLet me compute this step by step:\n\nFirst term: x*(b - 24)\n\nSecond term: a*(24 - 0) = 24a\n\nThird term: x*(0 - b) = -x b\n\nTherefore, inside the absolute value: x(b -24) +24a - x b = x b -24x +24a -x b = -24x +24a = 24(a - x)\n\nTaking absolute value and multiplying by 1/2:\n\n\u0394 = (1/2)*|24(a - x)| = 12|a - x|\n\nBut since X is inside the rectangle, and a is between 0 and x, so a - x would be negative, so |a - x| = x - a. Therefore, \u0394 = 12(x - a)\n\nTherefore, the area is 12(x - a)\n\nNow, the circumradius R2 for triangle BXC is given as 15. Applying the formula R = (BX * XC * BC)/(4\u0394):\n\nR2 = (BX * XC * 24)/(4*12(x - a)) = (BX * XC *24)/(48(x - a)) = (BX * XC)/(2(x - a))\n\nSet that equal to 15:\n\n(BX * XC)/(2(x - a)) =15 \u2192 BX * XC = 30(x - a)\n\nCompute BX and XC in terms of coordinates:\n\nBX = \u221a[(x - a)^2 + b\u00b2]\n\nXC = \u221a[(x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ]\n\nTherefore, their product is \u221a[ ( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 )( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\u221a[ ( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 )( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] = 30(x - a)\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n[ ( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 )( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] = 900(x - a)^2\n\nOkay, so that's equation (2).\n\nAdditionally, we have the equation from angle AXB being 90\u00b0, which gave us:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x. Let's note this as equation (0).\n\nSo, now we have three equations:\n\nEquation (0): a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x\n\nEquation (1): (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) = 676a\u00b2\n\nEquation (2): [ ( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 )( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] = 900(x - a)^2\n\nOur variables are a, b, and x. So, three equations with three variables. The challenge is to solve these equations.\n\nHmm, let's see if we can manipulate these equations to find x.\n\nFirst, let's see equation (0): a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x \u2192 this can be rearranged as x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/a = a + (b\u00b2)/a.\n\nSo, maybe we can express x in terms of a and b, which might help substitute into equations (1) and (2).\n\nLet me try to substitute x from equation (0) into equations (1) and (2). Let's first work on equation (1).\n\nEquation (1):\n\nLeft side: (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nBut from equation (0), a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x. Let's substitute that:\n\nLeft side becomes (a x)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nSet equal to 676a\u00b2:\n\nSo,\n\na x (a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) = 676a\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by a (assuming a \u22600, which is reasonable because X is inside the rectangle, so a>0):\n\nx (a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) = 676a\n\nBut from equation (0), x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/a, so substituting that in:\n\n[(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/a] * [a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ] = 676a\n\nMultiply both sides by a to eliminate denominator:\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)[a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ] = 676a\u00b2\n\nHmm, but that's the original equation (1). So, not helpful.\n\nHmm, maybe we can let\u2019s see equation (1) again. Let me write equation (1):\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) = 676a\u00b2\n\nLet me denote (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) as S, so S = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, then equation (0) tells us S = a x. \n\nThen, the second term in the left side is a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2. Let me compute that:\n\na\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 - 48b + b\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) + 576 - 48b = S + 576 - 48b\n\nTherefore, equation (1):\n\nS*(S + 576 - 48b) = 676a\u00b2\n\nBut S = a x, so substitute that:\n\n(a x)(a x + 576 - 48b) = 676a\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by a (again, a \u22600):\n\nx (a x + 576 - 48b) = 676a\n\nHmm, but x is expressed in terms of a and b via equation (0): x = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/a = (S)/a.\n\nSo substituting x into the above equation:\n\n[(S/a)] * [ a*(S/a) + 576 - 48b ] = 676a\n\nSimplify term inside the brackets:\n\na*(S/a) is S, so:\n\n[ (S/a) ] * [ S + 576 - 48b ] = 676a\n\nMultiply out:\n\n(S/a)*(S + 576 -48b) = 676a\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\nS*(S + 576 -48b) = 676a\u00b2\n\nWait, but that's exactly the equation we had before. So, no progress here. Hmm, perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nLet me try to see if I can find a relationship between equations (1) and (2). Let me look at equation (2):\n\n[ ( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 )( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] = 900(x - a)^2\n\nLet me denote T = (x - a). Let me also note that from equation (0):\n\nx = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/a, so T = x - a = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)/a - a = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/a = b\u00b2/a.\n\nTherefore, T = b\u00b2/a.\n\nSo substituting T into equation (2):\n\n[ (T\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(T\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] = 900 T\u00b2\n\nBecause (x - a)^2 is T\u00b2, and (24 - b)^2 is as is. \n\nTherefore, substituting T = b\u00b2/a:\n\n[ ( (b\u00b2/a)^2 + b\u00b2 ) ( (b\u00b2/a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] = 900*(b\u00b2/a)^2\n\nHmm, complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the first factor in the left side: (T\u00b2 + b\u00b2) where T = b\u00b2/a:\n\nT\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = (b^4/a\u00b2) + b\u00b2 = (b^4 + a\u00b2 b\u00b2)/a\u00b2 = b\u00b2(b\u00b2 + a\u00b2)/a\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, the second factor is (T\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2):\n\n= (b^4/a\u00b2) + (24 - b)^2 = (b^4)/a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2\n\nTherefore, the entire left side is:\n\n[ b\u00b2(b\u00b2 + a\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ] * [ (b^4)/a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ]\n\nThis equals the right side:\n\n900*(b^4/a\u00b2)\n\nHmm, this is going to be messy, but let's try to plug in some substitutions. Let's note that from equation (0):\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x. Wait, but maybe I can express a\u00b2 in terms of x and b\u00b2? From equation (0), a\u00b2 = a x - b\u00b2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let\u2019s see if there's a way to connect equations (1) and (2) through variables. Alternatively, maybe express variables in terms of T?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that perhaps there is symmetry between equations (1) and (2) if we make some substitutions. Let me think.\n\nWait, maybe if we consider that equations (1) and (2) are similar in structure. Let me see:\n\nEquation (1) involves terms with a and b, and equation (2) involves terms with (x - a) and b. Since T = x - a = b\u00b2/a, this might be a way to substitute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if we set variables in terms of a and b, and then try to find relationships?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parametrize variables. Let me see.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so from the equation ax -a\u00b2 -b\u00b2 =0 \u2192 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =a x. So, if I think of this as a quadratic in a or b?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables such as letting a = k x, so expressing a in terms of x. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set a = k x, where 0 < k <1 (since a is between 0 and x). Then, from equation (0):\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x \u2192 (k x)^2 + b\u00b2 = k x * x \u2192 k\u00b2 x\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = k x\u00b2 \u2192 b\u00b2 = x\u00b2(k - k\u00b2)\n\nTherefore, b = x sqrt(k -k\u00b2). Hmm, but sqrt requires that k -k\u00b2 \u22650 \u2192 k(1 -k) \u22650 \u2192 0 \u2264k \u22641, which is true.\n\nSo, b = x sqrt(k(1 -k))\n\nHmm, perhaps that substitution can help in simplifying equations (1) and (2). Let me try.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set a =k x, so that 0 <k <1, and b = x sqrt(k -k\u00b2). Let me denote sqrt(k -k\u00b2) as sqrt(k(1 -k)), so that b =x sqrt(k(1 -k)).\n\nTherefore, b\u00b2 = x\u00b2 k(1 -k)\n\nSo, substituting into equations (1) and (2):\n\nFirst, equation (1):\n\n(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ) =676a\u00b2\n\nLet me compute each term with a =k x and b= x sqrt(k(1 -k))\n\nFirst, compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = (k x)^2 + x\u00b2 k(1 -k) =x\u00b2 [k\u00b2 +k(1 -k)] =x\u00b2 [k\u00b2 +k -k\u00b2] =x\u00b2 k\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =x\u00b2 k, which matches equation (0): a x =k x *x =x\u00b2 k, so that checks out.\n\nThen, the first term in equation (1) is (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) =x\u00b2 k\n\nThe second term is a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2:\n\n= (k x)^2 + (24 - b)^2 =k\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (24 - x sqrt(k(1 -k)))^2\n\nHmm, this might get complicated, but let's proceed.\n\nLet me denote term2 = a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 =k\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2\n\nTherefore, equation (1):\n\n(x\u00b2 k)*(term2) =676*(a)^2 =676*(k x)^2\n\nTherefore,\n\nx\u00b2 k * term2 =676 k\u00b2 x\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by x\u00b2 (assuming x \u22600):\n\nk * term2 =676 k\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by k (assuming k\u22600):\n\nterm2 =676 k\n\nTherefore,\n\nterm2 =676 k \u2192 k\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 =676k\n\nBut term2 is equal to that, so:\n\nk\u00b2 x\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 =676k\n\nBut b =x sqrt(k(1 -k)), so substituting:\n\n(24 -b)^2 =24\u00b2 -48b +b\u00b2= 576 -48b +b\u00b2\n\nTherefore, term2 becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 x\u00b2 +576 -48b +b\u00b2 =676k\n\nBut b\u00b2 =x\u00b2 k(1 -k). Let me substitute that:\n\nk\u00b2 x\u00b2 +576 -48b +x\u00b2 k(1 -k) =676k\n\nCombine the x\u00b2 terms:\n\nk\u00b2 x\u00b2 +x\u00b2 k(1 -k) =x\u00b2 [k\u00b2 +k(1 -k)] =x\u00b2 [k\u00b2 +k -k\u00b2] =x\u00b2 k\n\nTherefore, term2 becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 k +576 -48b =676k\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 k +576 -48b =676k \u2192 x\u00b2 k -676k +576 -48b =0 \u2192k(x\u00b2 -676) + (576 -48b)=0\n\nHmm, so:\n\nk(x\u00b2 -676) +576 -48b =0 \u2192 equation (1a)\n\nBut b =x sqrt(k(1 -k)), so substituting that:\n\nk(x\u00b2 -676) +576 -48 x sqrt(k(1 -k)) =0\n\nThis is equation (1a), which is a relation between x and k.\n\nNow, moving on to equation (2):\n\n[ ( (x - a)^2 + b\u00b2 )( (x - a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] = 900(x - a)^2\n\nAgain, using a =k x and b =x sqrt(k(1 -k)), let's compute each term.\n\nFirst, compute (x -a) =x -k x =x(1 -k)\n\nThen, (x - a)^2 =x\u00b2 (1 -k)^2\n\nAlso, b\u00b2 =x\u00b2 k(1 -k)\n\nTherefore, (x -a)^2 + b\u00b2 =x\u00b2 (1 -k)^2 +x\u00b2 k(1 -k)=x\u00b2 (1 -k)[(1 -k)+k] =x\u00b2 (1 -k)(1) =x\u00b2 (1 -k)\n\nSimilarly, the second term in the product is (x -a)^2 + (24 - b)^2:\n\n= x\u00b2 (1 -k)^2 + (24 -b)^2\n\nAgain, (24 -b)^2 =576 -48b +b\u00b2 =576 -48b +x\u00b2 k(1 -k)\n\nTherefore, (x -a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 =x\u00b2 (1 -k)^2 +576 -48b +x\u00b2 k(1 -k)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nx\u00b2 [ (1 -k)^2 +k(1 -k) ] +576 -48b\n\n= x\u00b2 [ (1 -2k +k\u00b2) +k -k\u00b2 ] +576 -48b\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\n1 -2k +k\u00b2 +k -k\u00b2 =1 -k\n\nThus:\n\nx\u00b2 (1 -k) +576 -48b\n\nTherefore, the second term is x\u00b2 (1 -k) +576 -48b\n\nTherefore, the left side of equation (2):\n\n[ (x -a)^2 + b\u00b2 ] * [ (x -a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ]\n\n= [x\u00b2 (1 -k)] * [x\u00b2 (1 -k) +576 -48b ]\n\nSet equal to right side:\n\n900(x -a)^2 =900 x\u00b2 (1 -k)^2\n\nTherefore, equation (2):\n\nx\u00b2 (1 -k) [x\u00b2 (1 -k) +576 -48b ] =900 x\u00b2 (1 -k)^2\n\nDivide both sides by x\u00b2 (1 -k) [assuming x \u22600 and 1 -k \u22600, which they are since k is between 0 and1]\n\nThus:\n\nx\u00b2 (1 -k) +576 -48b =900 (1 -k)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx\u00b2 (1 -k) +576 -48b -900(1 -k) =0 \u2192x\u00b2 (1 -k) -900(1 -k) +576 -48b =0\n\nFactor out (1 -k):\n\n(1 -k)(x\u00b2 -900) + (576 -48b)=0 \u2192 equation (2a)\n\nNow, let's see equations (1a) and (2a):\n\nEquation (1a):\n\nk(x\u00b2 -676) +576 -48b =0\n\nEquation (2a):\n\n(1 -k)(x\u00b2 -900) +576 -48b =0\n\nNotice that both equations have the term (576 -48b). Let me subtract equation (1a) from equation (2a):\n\n[ (1 -k)(x\u00b2 -900) +576 -48b ] - [k(x\u00b2 -676) +576 -48b ] =0 -0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1 -k)(x\u00b2 -900) -k(x\u00b2 -676) =0\n\nExpand the terms:\n\n(1 -k)x\u00b2 - (1 -k)*900 -k x\u00b2 +k*676 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n[(1 -k)x\u00b2 -k x\u00b2] + [ -900 +900k +676k ] =0\n\nThe x\u00b2 terms:\n\n(1 -k -k)x\u00b2 = (1 -2k)x\u00b2\n\nThe constants:\n\n-900 + (900k +676k) = -900 + (1576k)\n\nThus:\n\n(1 -2k)x\u00b2 + (-900 +1576k) =0 \u2192 (1 -2k)x\u00b2 =900 -1576k \u2192 equation (3)\n\nSo, equation (3) relates x and k:\n\nx\u00b2 = [900 -1576k]/(1 -2k)\n\nHmm, that seems manageable. Let me note this.\n\nNow, perhaps I can express 576 -48b from equation (1a):\n\nFrom equation (1a):\n\nk(x\u00b2 -676) + (576 -48b)=0 \u2192576 -48b = -k(x\u00b2 -676)\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2a):\n\n(1 -k)(x\u00b2 -900) + (576 -48b)=0 \u2192576 -48b = -(1 -k)(x\u00b2 -900)\n\nTherefore, equating the two expressions for (576 -48b):\n\n-k(x\u00b2 -676) = -(1 -k)(x\u00b2 -900)\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nk(x\u00b2 -676) = (1 -k)(x\u00b2 -900)\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n(1)(x\u00b2 -900) -k(x\u00b2 -900) =x\u00b2 -900 -k x\u00b2 +900k\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\nk x\u00b2 -676k =x\u00b2 -900 -k x\u00b2 +900k\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nk x\u00b2 -676k -x\u00b2 +900 +k x\u00b2 -900k =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(k x\u00b2 +k x\u00b2) + (-x\u00b2) + (-676k -900k) +900 =0\n\n\u2192 2k x\u00b2 -x\u00b2 -1576k +900 =0 \u2192 x\u00b2(2k -1) -1576k +900 =0\n\nWait, this is exactly the same as equation (3):\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\n(1 -2k)x\u00b2 =900 -1576k \u2192 multiply both sides by -1: (2k -1)x\u00b2 = -900 +1576k \u2192 same as above. So, that's consistent.\n\nThus, equation (3) is necessary, but we need another equation to solve for x and k. Perhaps we can use equation (1a) or (2a) along with equation (3).\n\nLet me try substituting x\u00b2 from equation (3) into equation (1a).\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\nx\u00b2 = [900 -1576k]/(1 -2k)\n\nLet me plug this into equation (1a):\n\nk(x\u00b2 -676) +576 -48b =0\n\nFirst, compute x\u00b2 -676:\n\n= [ (900 -1576k)/(1 -2k) ) ] -676 = [900 -1576k -676*(1 -2k) ] / (1 -2k)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n900 -1576k -676 +1352k = (900 -676) + (-1576k +1352k) =224 -224k\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 -676 = (224 -224k)/(1 -2k) =224(1 -k)/(1 -2k)\n\nThus, the first term in equation (1a):\n\nk*(x\u00b2 -676) =k* [224(1 -k)/(1 -2k) ]\n\nSecond term is 576 -48b. Let me compute 576 -48b.\n\nBut b =x sqrt(k(1 -k)). So,\n\n576 -48b =576 -48x sqrt(k(1 -k))\n\nTherefore, equation (1a):\n\nk*[224(1 -k)/(1 -2k)] +576 -48x sqrt(k(1 -k)) =0\n\nHmm, this is getting quite involved. Let me see if we can express x sqrt(k(1 -k)) in terms of known quantities.\n\nWait, note that from equation (0):\n\na =k x, and b =x sqrt(k(1 -k))\n\nSo, sqrt(k(1 -k)) = b/x,\n\nThus, x sqrt(k(1 -k)) = b. Wait, that's exactly b. So, that term is 48b.\n\nWait a second, so 48x sqrt(k(1 -k)) is 48b. Therefore, 576 -48b is just 576 -48b. Wait, but that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express b in terms of x and k:\n\nb =x sqrt(k(1 -k))\n\nThus, sqrt(k(1 -k)) = b/x \u2192 k(1 -k) = (b/x)^2. Hmm, perhaps not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that equation (3) gives x\u00b2 in terms of k, so perhaps I can also express b in terms of k and x, then substitute into equation (1a).\n\nLet me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let me rearrange equation (1a) with substitutions:\n\nWe have:\n\nk*[224(1 -k)/(1 -2k)] +576 -48b =0 \u2192 224k(1 -k)/(1 -2k) +576 =48b\n\nDivide both sides by 48:\n\n(224k(1 -k))/(48(1 -2k)) +576/48 =b\n\nSimplify:\n\n224/48 = 14/3, so:\n\n(14/3)*k(1 -k)/(1 -2k) +12 =b\n\nThus,\n\nb = (14/3)* [k(1 -k)/(1 -2k)] +12 \u2192 equation (1b)\n\nBut also, from earlier,\n\nb =x sqrt(k(1 -k))\n\nSo,\n\nx sqrt(k(1 -k)) = (14/3)* [k(1 -k)/(1 -2k)] +12 \u2192 equation (4)\n\nHmm, but x is also expressed in terms of k via equation (3):\n\nx\u00b2 = [900 -1576k]/(1 -2k) \u2192 x = sqrt( [900 -1576k]/(1 -2k) )\n\nTherefore, substituting x into equation (4):\n\nsqrt( [900 -1576k]/(1 -2k) ) * sqrt(k(1 -k)) = (14/3)* [k(1 -k)/(1 -2k)] +12\n\nLet me simplify the left side:\n\nsqrt( [ (900 -1576k) * k(1 -k) ] / (1 -2k) )\n\n= sqrt [ k(1 -k)(900 -1576k) / (1 -2k) ]\n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. I might need to look for another approach or perhaps find a substitution where variables cancel.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that x is an integer, given that the circumradii are 13 and 15, which are integers, so perhaps the sides are integers as well. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way to approach the problem by using coordinate geometry with the right angle at X and the circumradius conditions.\n\nWait, since triangle AXB is right-angled at X, with AX and XB perpendicular. So, coordinates of X must satisfy the condition we had: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = a x.\n\nPerhaps we can use coordinate geometry for triangles AXD and BXC.\n\nAlternatively, since triangles AXD and BXC are acute, which imposes some conditions on the position of X. For example, in triangle AXD, all angles must be acute, so the square of each side must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nBut maybe this is too involved. Alternatively, let's see if we can use the fact that in a triangle with circumradius R, the sides must satisfy a certain relationship. For triangle AXD with circumradius 13, so:\n\nFor triangle AXD:\n\nLet me denote the sides as AX = \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2), XD = \u221a(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2), AD =24.\n\nThe circumradius R1 =13 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4\u0394), and \u0394=12a.\n\nSo:\n\n(AX * XD *24)/(4*12a)=13 \u2192 AX * XD = (13 *4*12a)/(24)= (13*48a)/24=26a, which matches what we had earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for triangle AXD:\n\nIn any triangle, the circumradius R = a/(2 sin A), where a is a side and A is the opposite angle. \n\nSo, for triangle AXD, let's consider angle at D. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps if I can find coordinates where the circumradius can be related directly. Alternatively, since AD is a side of the rectangle, perhaps there is some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that in triangle AXD, the circumradius is 13. The side AD is 24, so R1 =13 = (AD)/(2 sin \u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle opposite AD, which would be angle at X.\n\nWait, in triangle AXD, the angle opposite AD is angle at X. Let me denote angle at X as \u03c6. Then,\n\nUsing the formula R = (AD)/(2 sin \u03c6). So,\n\n13 = 24/(2 sin \u03c6) \u2192 sin \u03c6 = 24/(2*13)=12/13 \u2192 \u03c6 = arcsin(12/13). Since triangle is acute, \u03c6 must be less than 90\u00b0, so this is okay.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC, the circumradius is 15, and the side BC is 24. So, angle at X in triangle BXC (opposite BC) would have:\n\n15=24/(2 sin \u03b8) \u2192 sin\u03b8=24/(2*15)=24/30=4/5 \u2192 \u03b8=arcsin(4/5). Again acute.\n\nHmm, this might be a helpful approach. Let me elaborate:\n\nIn triangle AXD:\n\n- The side AD =24 is opposite angle at X, so angle at X is \u03c6 with sin \u03c6 =12/13, so cos \u03c6=5/13 (since sin^2 +cos^2=1).\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC:\n\n- The side BC=24 is opposite angle at X, so angle at X is \u03b8 with sin\u03b8=4/5, so cos\u03b8=3/5.\n\nSince both triangles AXD and BXC have an angle at X, which is part of the right angle AXB. Wait, but angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so angle at X between A and B is 90\u00b0, but angle at X in triangle AXD is angle between AX and XD, and angle at X in BXC is angle between BX and XC. \n\nHmm, perhaps the angles \u03c6 and \u03b8 are related to the right angle at X?\n\nWait, let me consider the position of point X. Since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, the lines XA and XB are perpendicular. The other triangles involve XD and XC.\n\nMaybe we can consider vectors again. Since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, we had the condition a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =a x. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities from the angles in the triangles.\n\nIn triangle AXD, angle at X is \u03c6, with sin \u03c6 =12/13. So, in triangle AXD:\n\nUsing the Law of Sines,\n\nAX / sin(angle at D) = XD / sin(angle at A) = AD / sin(angle at X) = 2*13 =26\n\nWait, Law of Sines states that in any triangle, a/sin A = 2R. So, for triangle AXD,\n\nAD / sin(angle at X) = 2*R1 =26\n\nWhich gives AD / sin \u03c6 =26 \u2192 24 / sin \u03c6 =26 \u2192 sin \u03c6=24/26=12/13, which matches earlier.\n\nSimilarly, AX / sin(angle at D) =26 \u2192 AX =26 sin(angle at D)\n\nSimilarly, XD / sin(angle at A)=26 \u2192 XD=26 sin(angle at A)\n\nSince the sum of angles in triangle is 180\u00b0, angle at A + angle at D + angle at X =180\u00b0\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC, angle at X is \u03b8 with sin\u03b8=4/5, so:\n\nBC / sin\u03b8 =2*R2=30 \u2192 24 / (4/5)=30 \u2192 24*(5/4)=30, which checks out.\n\nThus, in triangle BXC,\n\nBX / sin(angle at C)=2*R2=30,\n\nXC / sin(angle at B)=30,\n\nand angle at B + angle at C + angle at X=180\u00b0\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find coordinates using the angles.\n\nAlternatively, considering the coordinates and the angles, perhaps we can set up trigonometric relationships.\n\nAlternatively, think of triangle AXD: angle at X is \u03c6 with sin \u03c6=12/13, so tan \u03c6=12/5.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC, angle at X is \u03b8 with sin\u03b8=4/5, so tan\u03b8=4/3.\n\nSince angle AXB is 90\u00b0, which is the angle between vectors XA and XB. Let me think in terms of vectors.\n\nThe angle between vectors XA and XB is 90\u00b0, so their dot product is zero, which gives the equation a(x -a) - b\u00b2=0 as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angles \u03c6 and \u03b8 are related to the right angle at X.\n\nLet me consider the position of point X in the coordinate system. Let me denote the coordinates as (a,b). The vectors from X to A are (-a, -b), to D are (-a, 24 - b), to B are (x -a, -b), and to C are (x -a, 24 - b).\n\nIn triangle AXD, angle at X is between vectors XD and XA. The vectors XD is from X to D: (-a,24 - b), and XA is from X to A: (-a, -b). The angle between them is \u03c6.\n\nThe cosine of angle \u03c6 can be found by the dot product:\n\ncos \u03c6 = (XA \u2022 XD) / (|XA| |XD| )\n\nXA \u2022 XD = (-a)(-a) + (-b)(24 - b) =a\u00b2 -b(24 - b)\n\n|XA| =\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\n|XD| =\u221a(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nWe already know cos \u03c6 =5/13 from earlier (since sin \u03c6=12/13, cos \u03c6=5/13).\n\nSo,\n\n[ a\u00b2 -b(24 - b) ] / [ \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * \u221a(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2) ] =5/13\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC, angle at X between vectors XB and XC is \u03b8 with cos\u03b8=3/5.\n\nVectors XB is (x -a, -b) and XC is (x -a, 24 - b). The angle between them is \u03b8.\n\nCompute the dot product:\n\nXB \u2022 XC = (x -a)^2 + (-b)(24 - b) = (x -a)^2 -b(24 - b)\n\nThe magnitudes:\n\n|XB| =\u221a[(x -a)^2 + b\u00b2]\n\n|XC| =\u221a[(x -a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ]\n\nTherefore,\n\n[ (x -a)^2 -b(24 - b) ] / [ \u221a((x -a)^2 + b\u00b2)*\u221a((x -a)^2 + (24 - b)^2) ] =3/5\n\nThis gives two equations involving a, b, and x. Let me write them down.\n\nFirst equation from triangle AXD:\n\n[ a\u00b2 -b(24 - b) ] = (5/13) * \u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) * \u221a(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 )\n\nSecond equation from triangle BXC:\n\n[ (x -a)^2 -b(24 - b) ] = (3/5) * \u221a[(x -a)^2 + b\u00b2] * \u221a[(x -a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ]\n\nBut note that the products of the square roots in these equations are exactly the numerators from equations (1) and (2):\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n\u221a[ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2) ] =26a\n\nSimilarly for equation (2):\n\n\u221a[ ( (x -a)^2 + b\u00b2 )( (x -a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ) ] =30(x -a)\n\nTherefore, substituting these into the trigonometric equations:\n\nFirst equation (from AXD):\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 -b(24 -b)\n\nRight side: (5/13)*(26a) \u2192 (5/13)(26a)=10a\n\nThus:\n\na\u00b2 -b(24 -b)=10a \u2192 a\u00b2 -24b +b\u00b2 =10a \u2192 (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2) -24b =10a\n\nBut from equation (0): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x, so substituting:\n\na x -24b =10a \u2192 a(x -10) =24b \u2192 equation (5)\n\nSimilarly, the second equation from BXC:\n\nLeft side: (x -a)^2 -b(24 -b)\n\nRight side: (3/5)*(30(x -a)) = (3/5)*30(x -a)=18(x -a)\n\nThus,\n\n(x -a)^2 -b(24 -b)=18(x -a)\n\nExpand (x -a)^2:\n\nx\u00b2 -2a x +a\u00b2 -24b +b\u00b2 =18x -18a\n\nRearrange terms:\n\nx\u00b2 -2a x +a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -24b -18x +18a=0\n\nGroup terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + (-2a x -18x) + (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2) + ( -24b +18a ) =0\n\nFactor x terms:\n\nx\u00b2 -x(2a +18) + (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2) + (-24b +18a)=0\n\nAgain, from equation (0): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x, so substitute that:\n\nx\u00b2 -x(2a +18) + a x -24b +18a =0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b2 -x(2a +18 -a) + (-24b +18a)=0 \u2192 x\u00b2 -x(a +18) -24b +18a=0 \u2192 equation (6)\n\nNow, we have equations (5) and (6):\n\nEquation (5): a(x -10)=24b \u2192 b = [a(x -10)]/24\n\nEquation (6):x\u00b2 -x(a +18) -24b +18a=0\n\nLet me substitute b from equation (5) into equation (6):\n\nx\u00b2 -x(a +18) -24*[a(x -10)/24] +18a =0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n- The third term: -24*[a(x-10)/24] = -a(x -10)\n\nThus:\n\nx\u00b2 -x(a +18) -a(x -10) +18a =0\n\nExpand the terms:\n\nx\u00b2 -a x -18x -a x +10a +18a =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b2 -a x -a x -18x +10a +18a \u2192 x\u00b2 -2a x -18x +28a =0\n\nFactor terms with x:\n\nx\u00b2 -x(2a +18) +28a=0 \u2192 equation (6a)\n\nNow, we need another relation between a and x. Let's recall equation (0): a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =a x.\n\nFrom equation (5), b= [a(x -10)]/24. Substitute into equation (0):\n\na\u00b2 + [a(x -10)/24]^2 =a x\n\nLet me compute this:\n\na\u00b2 + [a\u00b2 (x -10)^2]/(24\u00b2) =a x\n\nMultiply all terms by 24\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24\u00b2 a\u00b2 + a\u00b2 (x -10)^2 =24\u00b2 a x\n\nFactor a\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 [24\u00b2 + (x -10)^2 ] =24\u00b2 a x\n\nDivide both sides by a (assuming a \u22600):\n\na [24\u00b2 + (x -10)^2 ]=24\u00b2 x \u2192 equation (0a)\n\nTherefore,\n\na = [24\u00b2 x ] / [24\u00b2 + (x -10)^2 ] \u2192 equation (7)\n\nNow, we can substitute equation (7) into equation (6a):\n\nEquation (6a): x\u00b2 -x(2a +18) +28a =0\n\nLet me express everything in terms of x:\n\nFirst, compute a from equation (7):\n\na = (24\u00b2 x)/[24\u00b2 + (x -10)^2 ]\n\nLet me denote D =24\u00b2 + (x -10)^2 for simplicity.\n\nThus, a = (576x)/D\n\nPlugging into equation (6a):\n\nx\u00b2 -x[2*(576x/D) +18] +28*(576x/D) =0\n\nThis is quite complex, but let me write it term by term:\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2\n\nSecond term: -x*(2*(576x/D) +18) = -x*(1152x/D +18 )\n\nThird term: 28*(576x/D) = 16128x/D\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b2 - [1152x\u00b2/D +18x] +16128x/D =0\n\nMultiply all terms by D to eliminate denominators:\n\nx\u00b2 D -1152x\u00b2 -18x D +16128x =0\n\nNow, substitute D =24\u00b2 + (x -10)^2 =576 +x\u00b2 -20x +100 =x\u00b2 -20x +676\n\nThus, D =x\u00b2 -20x +676.\n\nTherefore, substitute into the equation:\n\nx\u00b2*(x\u00b2 -20x +676) -1152x\u00b2 -18x*(x\u00b2 -20x +676) +16128x =0\n\nExpand each term step by step:\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2(x\u00b2 -20x +676) =x^4 -20x^3 +676x\u00b2\n\nSecond term: -1152x\u00b2\n\nThird term: -18x*(x\u00b2 -20x +676) =-18x^3 +360x\u00b2 -12168x\n\nFourth term:+16128x\n\nCombine all terms:\n\nFirst term:\n\nx^4 -20x^3 +676x\u00b2\n\nSecond term:\n\n-1152x\u00b2\n\nThird term:\n\n-18x^3 +360x\u00b2 -12168x\n\nFourth term:\n\n+16128x\n\nNow, combine like terms:\n\nx^4 term: x^4\n\nx^3 terms: -20x^3 -18x^3 =-38x^3\n\nx^2 terms:676x\u00b2 -1152x\u00b2 +360x\u00b2 = (676 -1152 +360)x\u00b2 = (676+360=1036; 1036-1152= -116)x\u00b2 \u2192 -116x\u00b2\n\nx terms: -12168x +16128x = (16128 -12168)x =3960x\n\nConstants: none.\n\nThus, the entire equation is:\n\nx^4 -38x^3 -116x\u00b2 +3960x =0\n\nFactor out an x:\n\nx(x\u00b3 -38x\u00b2 -116x +3960)=0\n\nSince x is the length AB, which is positive, we can disregard the solution x=0. Thus, we need to solve the cubic equation:\n\nx\u00b3 -38x\u00b2 -116x +3960=0\n\nHmm, solving a cubic equation might be tedious, but perhaps we can factor it by trying integer roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 3960 divided by factors of 1 (leading coefficient). So possible roots are \u00b11, \u00b12, ..., \u00b13960.

So,\n\nR1 = (AX * XD *24)/(4*12a)= (AX * XD *24)/(48a)= (AX * XD)/(2a)=13 \u2192 AX * XD=26a.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, BC=24, circumradius 15, so:\n\n( BX * XC *24)/(4*12(x\u2212a)) =15 \u2192 (BX * XC)/(2(x\u2212a))=15 \u2192 BX * XC=30(x\u2212a).\n\nAdditionally, angle AXB =90\u00b0, so AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 \u2192 but wait, AX and BX are perpendicular vectors. Wait, the vectors XA and XB are perpendicular, but their lengths squared sum to?\n\nWait, actually, since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, the Pythagorean theorem applies to triangle AXB:\n\nAX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 \u2192 but AX is the length from A to X, BX from B to X, so:\n\nAX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = AB\u00b2?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Because in triangle AXB, which is right-angled at X, the hypotenuse is AB. Wait, no. Wait, in triangle AXB, right-angled at X, the legs are AX and BX, so the hypotenuse is AB? Wait, no, AB is a side of the rectangle, so the hypotenuse would be AB only if X is at the right place, but generally, the hypotenuse would be AB. Wait, no, the hypotenuse would be the side opposite the right angle, so if angle at X is 90\u00b0, then the hypotenuse is AB. Wait, but AB is a side of the rectangle. So, yes, in triangle AXB, right-angled at X, then by Pythagoras:\n\nAX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = AB\u00b2.\n\nWait, this is a crucial relation I didn't use before!\n\nThis is a key insight. Since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, then in triangle AXB, AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = AB\u00b2. Since AB is the side of the rectangle we're trying to find, this gives us another equation.\n\nSo, let's note this as equation (4):\n\nAX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 \u2192 (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) + [(x -a)^2 +b\u00b2] =x\u00b2\n\nExpanding:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 + (x\u00b2 -2ax +a\u00b2) +b\u00b2 =x\u00b2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2a\u00b2 +2b\u00b2 -2a x +x\u00b2 =x\u00b2\n\nSubtract x\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n2a\u00b2 +2b\u00b2 -2a x =0 \u2192 divide by 2:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -a x=0 \u2192 which is exactly our equation (0). So this doesn't provide new information. Hmm.\n\nHmm, so that equation is redundant. \n\nBack to the cubic equation. Maybe the cubic can be factored as follows:\n\nx\u00b3 -38x\u00b2 -116x +3960.\n\nLet me try to factor it by grouping:\n\nGroup terms as (x\u00b3 -38x\u00b2) + (-116x +3960)\n\nFactor x\u00b2 from first pair: x\u00b2(x -38) - 116(x -34.13...). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor as (x\u00b3 -38x\u00b2) - (116x -3960)\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, rewrite the cubic equation as:\n\nx\u00b3 -38x\u00b2 -116x +3960 =0\n\nLet me try to write it as x\u00b3 -38x\u00b2 =116x -3960\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the rational root theorem with factors of 3960 divided by possible denominators. Since leading coefficient is 1, possible rational roots are factors of 3960.\n\nLet me try x= 55:\n\n55\u00b3 -38*(55)^2 -116*55 +3960\n\n55\u00b3 =166,375\n\n38*55\u00b2=38*3025=114,950\n\n116*55=6,380\n\nThus,\n\n166,375 -114,950 =51,425\n\n51,425 -6,380 =45,045\n\n45,045 +3,960 =49,005\u22600\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let me try x= 55, which is too big. Maybe negative?\n\nx= - something? Unlikely.\n\nWait, maybe x= 26.4?\n\nWait, let me try to think if there is a better way.\n\nLet me consider the first equation involving AX * XD =26a and BX * XC=30(x\u2212a).\n\nFrom the coordinates:\n\nAX =\u221a(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)\n\nXD =\u221a[a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2]\n\nBX =\u221a[(x\u2212a)^2 + b\u00b2]\n\nXC =\u221a[(x\u2212a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ]\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set u = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2, v = (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2.\n\nThen, AX=\u221au, BX=\u221av.\n\nAlso, XD=\u221a[a\u00b2 + (24 - b)^2 ]=\u221a[ (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) + 576 -48b ] =\u221a[u +576 -48b]\n\nSimilarly, XC=\u221a[(x -a)^2 + (24 - b)^2 ]=\u221a[ (x -a)^2 +b\u00b2 +576 -48b ]=\u221a[v +576 -48b]\n\nThus,\n\nAX * XD =\u221au *\u221a[u +576 -48b ] =26a \u2192 equation (1)\n\nBX * XC =\u221av *\u221a[v +576 -48b ] =30(x\u2212a) \u2192 equation (2)\n\nAlso, from equation (0): u =a x.\n\nAlso, v = (x\u2212a)^2 +b\u00b2.\n\nSince from equation (0): b\u00b2=u -a\u00b2, so substituting into v:\n\nv = (x\u2212a)^2 + (u -a\u00b2) =x\u00b2 -2a x +a\u00b2 +u -a\u00b2 =x\u00b2 -2a x +u.\n\nBut u =a x, so:\n\nv =x\u00b2 -2a x +a x =x\u00b2 -a x.\n\nThus, v =x(x -a).\n\nSo, v =x(x -a).\n\nThus, we can express v in terms of x and a.\n\nTherefore, equation (2):\n\n\u221av *\u221a[v +576 -48b ] =30(x\u2212a)\n\nBut v =x(x -a), so:\n\n\u221a[x(x -a)] *\u221a[x(x -a) +576 -48b ] =30(x -a)\n\nLet me denote w =x(x -a). So equation (2):\n\n\u221aw *\u221a[w +576 -48b ] =30(x -a)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nw [w +576 -48b ] =900(x -a)^2\n\nBut w =x(x -a), so:\n\nx(x -a)[x(x -a) +576 -48b ] =900(x -a)^2\n\nDivide both sides by (x -a)^2 (assuming x\u2260a):\n\nx [x(x -a) +576 -48b ] / (x -a) =900\n\nLet me denote t =x -a \u2192 then x =a +t.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nx =a +t, so:\n\nLeft side:\n\n(a +t)[ (a +t)t +576 -48b ] / t =900\n\nExpand inside the brackets:\n\n(a +t)t +576 -48b =a t +t\u00b2 +576 -48b\n\nThus:\n\n(a +t)(a t +t\u00b2 +576 -48b ) /t =900\n\nThis might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's use equation (5): b= a(x -10)/24.\n\nThus, 48b =2a(x -10).\n\nSubstitute into equation:\n\nw [w +576 -48b ] =x(x -a)[x(x -a) +576 -2a(x -10) ]\n\n= x(x -a)[x(x -a) +576 -2a x +20a ]\n\nLet me compute the term inside the brackets:\n\nx(x -a) +576 -2a x +20a =x\u00b2 -a x +576 -2a x +20a =x\u00b2 -3a x +20a +576.\n\nThus,\n\nx(x -a)(x\u00b2 -3a x +20a +576 )=900(x -a)^2\n\nDivide both sides by (x -a):\n\nx (x\u00b2 -3a x +20a +576 ) =900(x -a)\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx\u00b3 -3a x\u00b2 +20a x +576x =900x -900a\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx\u00b3 -3a x\u00b2 +20a x +576x -900x +900a=0 \u2192x\u00b3 -3a x\u00b2 + (20a +576 -900)x +900a=0\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\nx\u00b3 -3a x\u00b2 + (20a -324)x +900a=0 \u2192 equation (8)\n\nNow, from equation (0): a x =a\u00b2 +b\u00b2, and from equation (5): b= a(x-10)/24.\n\nThus, b\u00b2= a\u00b2(x -10)^2/(24\u00b2)\n\nSo,\n\na x =a\u00b2 +a\u00b2(x -10)^2/(24\u00b2)\n\nDivide both sides by a:\n\nx =a + a(x -10)^2/(24\u00b2)\n\nRearranged:\n\na [ 1 + (x -10)^2 /576 ] =x \u2192 a= x / [1 + (x -10)^2/576 ] \u2192 which is the same as equation (7)\n\nThus, a=576x/[576 + (x-10)^2]\n\nLet me substitute this expression for a into equation (8).\n\nEquation (8):\n\nx\u00b3 -3a x\u00b2 + (20a -324)x +900a=0\n\nSubstitute a=576x/D, where D=576 + (x-10)^2.\n\nThus:\n\nx\u00b3 -3*(576x/D)*x\u00b2 + (20*(576x/D) -324)x +900*(576x/D)=0\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: x\u00b3\n\nSecond term: -3*(576x/D)*x\u00b2 = -1728x\u00b3/D\n\nThird term:\n\n[ (20*576x/D -324) ]x = (11520x/D -324)x =11520x\u00b2/D -324x\n\nFourth term:900*(576x/D)=518,400x/D\n\nCombine all terms:\n\nx\u00b3 - (1728x\u00b3)/D + (11520x\u00b2)/D -324x + (518400x)/D =0\n\nMultiply all terms by D to eliminate denominators:\n\nx\u00b3 D -1728x\u00b3 +11520x\u00b2 -324x D +518400x=0\n\nNow, substitute D=576 + (x-10)^2 =x\u00b2 -20x +676\n\nThus, substitute D:\n\nx\u00b3(x\u00b2 -20x +676) -1728x\u00b3 +11520x\u00b2 -324x(x\u00b2 -20x +676) +518400x =0\n\nThis is extremely complex, but let's expand term by term:\n\nFirst term: x\u00b3(x\u00b2 -20x +676) =x^5 -20x^4 +676x\u00b3\n\nSecond term: -1728x\u00b3\n\nThird term:+11520x\u00b2\n\nFourth term:-324x(x\u00b2 -20x +676)= -324x\u00b3 +6,480x\u00b2 -218, 784x (since 324*676=218,784?)\n\nWait, 324*600=194,400 and 324*76=24,624 \u2192 total 194,400+24,624=219,024? Hmm, perhaps better to compute 676*324:\n\n676*300=202,800; 676*24=16, 224 \u2192 total 202,800+16,224=219,024. So, yes.\n\nThus, fourth term is -324x\u00b3 +6,480x\u00b2 -219,024x.\n\nFifth term:+518,400x.\n\nCombine all terms:\n\nStart with x^5 term:\n\nx^5\n\nx^4 terms:\n\n-20x^4\n\nx^3 terms:\n\n676x\u00b3 -1728x\u00b3 -324x\u00b3 = (676 -1728 -324)x\u00b3 = (676 -2052)= -1376x\u00b3\n\nx\u00b2 terms:\n\n11520x\u00b2 +6,480x\u00b2 = (11520+6480)=18,000x\u00b2\n\nx terms:\n\n-219,024x +518,400x = (518,400 -219,024)x =299,376x\n\nConstants: none.\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nx^5 -20x^4 -1376x\u00b3 +18,000x\u00b2 +299,376x =0\n\nFactor out an x:\n\nx(x^4 -20x\u00b3 -1376x\u00b2 +18,000x +299,376)=0\n\nAgain, x=0 is not valid. Thus, need to solve quartic equation:\n\nx^4 -20x\u00b3 -1376x\u00b2 +18,000x +299,376=0\n\nThis is even worse. Clearly, this path is not feasible.\n\nPerhaps it's time to consider that the problem might have been designed with integer side lengths, so perhaps AB is 56, as 13 and 15 radii might hint at Pythagorean triples?\n\nWait, 13 and 15 are radii. The sides of the triangles AXD and BXC would need to form triples with 24. Let me think:\n\nIn triangle AXD with circumradius 13 and side AD=24. The sides must satisfy AX * XD * AD =4R\u0394. Wait, but maybe the triangle is a right triangle? No, because if AD were the hypotenuse, then the circumradius would be half of AD, which would be 12, but given R is 13, so it's not a right triangle.\n\nWait, but perhaps AXD is a triangle with sides 10, 24, and 26? Since 10-24-26 is a right triangle (10\u00b2+24\u00b2=100+576=676=26\u00b2), so R would be 13 (half of 26). Wait, that works!\n\nWait a second, if triangle AXD has sides 10, 24, 26, then its circumradius is 13, which is exactly what's given. Similarly, if triangle BXC has sides 18, 24, 30, then its circumradius is 15 (half of 30). Because 18-24-30 is a right triangle (18\u00b2+24\u00b2= 324+576=900=30\u00b2), so R=15.\n\nSo maybe the triangles AXD and BXC are right-angled? But the problem states that both triangles are acute. Wait, but right triangles are not acute. So this is contradictory. Hmm.\n\nBut if AXD is a right triangle, then it can't be acute. So that's not possible. Therefore, this approach is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sides aren't right triangles, but the products AX * XD =26a and BX * XC=30(x\u2212a) might be related to these numbers.\n\nWait, in the first case, if AX * XD =26a, and if AX and XD are the sides such that AX=10 and XD=26, then 10*26=260=26a \u2192 a=10. Similarly, maybe?\n\nLet me check:\n\nSuppose AX=10, XD=26, so their product is 260=26a \u2192 a=10.\n\nThen, AX^2 + XD^2 would be 100 + 676=776, but in triangle AXD, the sides are AX=10, XD=26, and AD=24. Check triangle inequality:\n\n10+24>26 \u2192 34>26 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n26+24>10 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n10+26>24 \u2714\ufe0f (40>24). So valid.\n\nThe triangle with sides 10,24,26 is a right triangle with right angle at A? Wait, let me see:\n\nAX=10, AD=24, XD=26. The angle at A would be between AX and AD. Compute using the Law of Cosines:\n\nXD\u00b2 =AX\u00b2 +AD\u00b2 -2*AX*AD*cos(angle at A)\n\n26\u00b2 =10\u00b2 +24\u00b2 -2*10*24*cos\u03b8\n\n676 =100+576 -480 cos\u03b8 \u2192676=676 -480 cos\u03b8 \u21920= -480 cos\u03b8 \u2192cos\u03b8=0 \u2192\u03b8=90\u00b0. So the triangle is right-angled at A.\n\nBut the problem states that triangle AXD is acute, so this is invalid. Thus, this can't be the case.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the triangles are not right-angled. But the product AX * XD=26a suggests some relationship.\n\nWait, if AX and XD are 13 and 4, then their product is 52=26a \u2192a=2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sides AX and XD are 26 and a, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that maybe the coordinates of X are such that a and b are integers.\n\nSuppose we let x be an integer, and see if equations can be satisfied.\n\nLet me assume AB =x=56, as a guess based on 13 and 15.\n\nThen, let's see if this works.\n\nAssume x=56. Let's see if equations can hold.\n\nFirst, from equation (0):a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 =56a \u2192 a\u00b2 -56a +b\u00b2=0.\n\nFrom equation (5):a(x-10)=24b \u2192 a*46=24b \u2192 b=(46a)/24= (23a)/12.\n\nSubstitute into equation (0):\n\na\u00b2 -56a + (23a/12)^2 =0\n\nCompute:\n\na\u00b2 -56a + (529a\u00b2)/144 =0 \u2192 multiply by 144:\n\n144a\u00b2 -56*144a +529a\u00b2 =0 \u2192 (144+529)a\u00b2 -8064a =0 \u2192673a\u00b2 -8064a =0 \u2192a(673a -8064)=0 \u2192a=0 or a=8064/673\u224812. So, a\u224812, then b= (23*12)/12=23.\n\nNow check equation (1):\n\nAX * XD =26a \u2192 AX=\u221a(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2)=\u221a(144 +529)=\u221a673\u224825.94\n\nXD=\u221a[a\u00b2 + (24 -b)^2 ]=\u221a[144 + (24-23)^2 ]=\u221a(144+1)=\u221a145\u224812.04\n\nAX * XD\u224825.94*12.04\u2248312. So 26a=26*12=312 \u2192 this matches!\n\nGreat! So this works.\n\nThen check equation (2):\n\nBX * XC=30(x\u2212a)=30*(56\u221212)=30*44=1320\n\nBX=\u221a[(x\u2212a)^2 +b\u00b2]=\u221a(44\u00b2 +23\u00b2)=\u221a(1936+529)=\u221a2465\u224849.65\n\nXC=\u221a[(x\u2212a)^2 + (24\u2212b)^2 ]=\u221a(44\u00b2 +1\u00b2)=\u221a(1936+1)=\u221a1937\u224844.01\n\nBX * XC\u224849.65*44.01\u22482185, but we need it to be 1320. Doesn't match. Hmm, so discrepancy here.\n\nWait, so close but not quite. Did I compute correctly?\n\nWait, if a=12, b=23, then:\n\nXC is sqrt( (56-12)^2 + (24-23)^2 ) = sqrt(44\u00b2 +1\u00b2)=sqrt(1936+1)=sqrt(1937) \u224844.01\n\nBX is sqrt(44\u00b2 +23\u00b2)=sqrt(1936+529)=sqrt(2465)\u224849.65\n\nTheir product is indeed ~44.01*49.65\u22482185, but needs to be 30*(56-12)=1320. Not matching.\n\nHmm, so close but not quite. Maybe x isn't 56.\n\nWait, let me check the other equations.\n\nWait, but the product AX * XD was exactly 26a when a=12, so that works.\n\nBut the other equation doesn't. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps there was an error in assuming x=56. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x= 56 is correct, but the values of a and b are different.\n\nWait, from equation (5): b=(23a)/12. If a= 12, then b=23.

Not matching.\n\nHmm, so not. \n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is x= 56, and the problem expects an approximate value, but since all given data are integers, perhaps the answer is 56.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nWait, the problem states that both triangles AXD and BXC are acute. In the case of x=56, triangle AXD has sides\u224825.94,12.04,24. The angles can be checked:\n\nThe largest side is AX\u224825.94, opposite angle at D.\n\nUsing Law of Cosines:\n\ncos(angle at D)= (XD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 -AX\u00b2)/(2*XD*AD)\n\n=(145 +576 -673)/(2*12.04*24)\n\n=(721 -673)/ (578.9)\n\n\u224848/578.9\u22480.083 \u2192 angle\u224885.3\u00b0, which is acute.\n\nAngle at X: angle opposite AD (24):\n\ncos(angle at X)= (AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 -AD\u00b2)/(2*AX*XD)\n\n=(673 +145 -576)/(2*25.94*12.04)\n\n=(242)/ (623)\u22480.388 \u2192 angle\u224867\u00b0, acute.\n\nAngle at A: 90\u00b0, but we saw earlier it's 90\u00b0, which would make it right-angled, but problem states it's acute. Thus, this is invalid.\n\nAh! There's the problem. So, if AXD is right-angled at A, it's not acute. Therefore, x=56 is invalid.\n\nThus, my assumption that led to x=56 was incorrect because it results in a right-angled triangle, which is not allowed.\n\nHence, need to find another solution.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is x=56 but with different a and b?\n\nAlternatively, maybe x= 40?\n\nWait, let me think differently. Let me consider that the triangles AXD and BXC have circumradius 13 and 15 respectively, and are acute.\n\nLet me think about the formula for circumradius:\n\nIn any triangle, R = a/(2 sin A). For an acute triangle, all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so all sines are less than 1, so R must be greater than half the side opposite the angle.\n\nFor triangle AXD with AD=24, which is one side. The angle opposite AD is at X, which we previously denoted as \u03c6 with sin \u03c6=12/13. Since 12/13 <1, angle \u03c6 is acute (since sin \u03c6=12/13 \u2192 \u03c6\u224867\u00b0). Thus, it's okay.\n\nFor triangle BXC, BC=24, angle opposite is at X with sin\u03b8=4/5\u2192\u03b8\u224853\u00b0, also acute.\n\nThus, the triangles are indeed acute. So, even though in my earlier example with x=56, the angle at A was 90\u00b0, but in that case, the triangle AXD had angle at A being 90\u00b0, which would make it not acute. So, that suggests that the assumption leading to x=56 is invalid because it caused triangle AXD to be right-angled at A, which is prohibited.\n\nThus, the correct solution must ensure that all angles in both triangles are acute, so angles at A, D in AXD, and angles at B, C in BXC are all acute.\n\nHence, the earlier approaches must be considered.\n\nPerhaps the cubic equation does have an integer solution that I missed.\n\nGoing back to the cubic equation x\u00b3 -38x\u00b2 -116x +3960=0.\n\nLet me try x= 30:\n\n30\u00b3 -38*30\u00b2 -116*30 +3960\n\n=27000 -38*900 -3480 +3960\n\n=27000 -34200 -3480 +3960\n\n= (27000+3960) - (34200+3480)=30960-37680= -6720\u22600.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, trying x= 33:\n\n33^3 =35937\n\n38*33\u00b2=38*1089=41,382\n\n116*33=3,828\n\nSo,\n\n35,937 -41,382 -3,828 +3960 =\n\n35,937 -41,382 = -5,445\n\n-5,445 -3,828 =-9,273\n\n-9,273 +3,960 =-5,313\u22600.\n\nHmm.\n\nx= 24:\n\n24\u00b3 -38*24\u00b2 -116*24 +3960=13,824-21,888-2,784+3,960= (13,824+3,960) - (21,888+2,784)=17,784-24,672= -6,888\u22600.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps x= 20:\n\n20\u00b3 -38*400 -116*20 +3960=8000-15,200 -2,320+3,960= (8000+3,960)=11,960 - (15,200+2,320)=17,520 \u219211,960-17,520= -5,560\u22600.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps x= 50:\n\n50^3 -38*50\u00b2 -116*50 +3960=125,000-38*2500-5,800+3,960=125,000-95,000=30,000 -5,800=24,200 +3,960=28,160\u22600.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe x= 26:\n\n26^3 -38*26\u00b2 -116*26 +3960=17,576 -38*676 -3,016 +3,960.\n\n38*676=25,688.\n\nThus,\n\n17,576 -25,688= -8,112\n\n-8,112 -3,016= -11,128\n\n-11,128 +3,960= -7,168\u22600.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps x= 42:\n\n42^3 -38*42\u00b2 -116*42 +3960.\n\n42\u00b3=74,088\n\n38*42\u00b2=38*1764= 38*(1700+64)=64,600 +2,432=67,032\n\n116*42=4,872\n\nThus,\n\n74,088 -67,032=7,056\n\n7,056 -4,872=2,184\n\n2,184 +3,960=6,144\u22600.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps x= 28:\n\n28^3 -38*28\u00b2 -116*28 +3960.\n\n28\u00b3=21,952\n\n38*784=29,792\n\n116*28=3,248\n\nThus,\n\n21,952 -29,792= -7,840\n\n-7,840 -3,248= -11,088\n\n-11,088 +3,960= -7,128\u22600.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps x= 36:\n\n36^3 -38*36\u00b2 -116*36 +3960.\n\n36\u00b3=46,656\n\n38*1296=49,248\n\n116*36=4,176\n\nThus,\n\n46,656 -49,248= -2,592\n\n-2,592 -4,176= -6,768\n\n-6,768 +3,960= -2,808\u22600.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, x= 18:\n\n18\u00b3 -38*18\u00b2 -116*18 +3960.\n\n18\u00b3=5832\n\n38*324=12,312\n\n116*18=2,088\n\nThus,\n\n5832 -12,312= -6,480\n\n-6,480 -2,088= -8,568\n\n-8,568 +3,960= -4,608\u22600.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, x= 16:\n\n16^3 -38*16\u00b2 -116*16 +3960.\n\n16^3=4096\n\n38*256=9,728\n\n116*16=1,856\n\nThus,\n\n4096-9,728= -5,632\n\n-5,632 -1,856= -7,488\n\n-7,488 +3,960= -3,528\u22600.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that the cubic equation might not have an integer root, so the answer might be a non-integer, but the problem states to compute AB, which is likely an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my setup.\n\nLet me re-express the problem with a different coordinate system.\n\nLet me place point A at (0,0), B at (x,0), D at (0,24), and C at (x,24).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and try to understand what's given and what needs to be found.\n\nWe have a rectangle ABCD with BC = 24. Point X is inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles ABD and BXC are both acute, and their circumradii are 13 and 15 respectively. We need to find the length of AB.\n\nWait, hold on, the problem says triangles AXD and BXC are both acute with circumradii 13 and 15. Let me make sure I got that right. The user wrote \"triangles \u25b3AXD and \u25b3BXC are both acute and have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively.\" Yeah, so that's correct. So triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, each having their own circumradius: 13 for AXD and 15 for BXC. Got it.\n\nAlright, so let's start by drawing a rectangle ABCD. Let me label the rectangle with A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So sides AB and CD are the bases with length AB which we need to find, and BC and AD are the heights, given as 24. Wait, BC is one of the sides. In a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so BC is equal to AD. Since BC is given as 24, that means AD is also 24. Therefore, the sides of the rectangle are AB (unknown) and 24.\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Hmm. So if I consider points A and B, then X is a point inside the rectangle where the angle at X between A and B is a right angle. That makes me think of the circle with diameter AB, but since X is inside the rectangle, the circle with diameter AB would pass through points A and B, but the right angle at X implies that X lies on the circle with diameter AB. Wait, but in a rectangle, the circle with diameter AB would have its center at the midpoint of AB, and radius AB/2. However, since the rectangle has height 24, the point X can't be outside the rectangle, so the circle with diameter AB must intersect the rectangle in such a way that X is inside.\n\nBut maybe I should set coordinates here to make this more concrete. Let's assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let me place point A at (0,0), so then point B would be at (a, 0), where a is the length AB, which we need to find. Then point D would be at (0,24), and point C at (a,24). So the rectangle has length AB = a and height BC =24.\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, so its coordinates would be (x,y) where 0 < x < a and 0 < y <24. The angle AXB is 90 degrees. So the vectors from X to A and from X to B must be perpendicular. Alternatively, the lines AX and BX are perpendicular. \n\nLet me recall that if angle AXB is 90\u00b0, then by the property of circles, X lies on the circle with diameter AB. But the circle with diameter AB would have its center at the midpoint of AB, which is (a/2, 0), and radius a/2. However, the coordinates of X must satisfy the equation of that circle. Let me write that equation.\n\nThe circle with diameter AB has center at (a/2, 0) and radius a/2, so the equation is (x - a/2)^2 + y^2 = (a/2)^2. Simplifying that, (x - a/2)^2 + y^2 = a\u00b2/4. Expanding the left side: x\u00b2 - a x + (a\u00b2)/4 + y\u00b2 = a\u00b2/4, so x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 = 0. So the coordinates of X must satisfy x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 = 0. So that's one equation related to point X.\n\nAdditionally, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute and have circumradii 13 and 15, respectively. Let me recall that the circumradius of a triangle with sides of length a, b, c is given by R = (a b c)/(4 \u0394), where \u0394 is the area of the triangle. Alternatively, for any triangle, the circumradius can also be expressed using the formula R = (side)/(2 sin \u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle opposite that side. Wait, perhaps using coordinates would be better here, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since triangles AXD and BXC are acute, all their angles are less than 90\u00b0, which might impose some constraints on the positions of X. But maybe first let's focus on the circumradius formula.\n\nFirst, let's consider triangle AXD. Its vertices are A (0,0), X (x,y), and D (0,24). Let me compute the lengths of the sides of triangle AXD.\n\nThe sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, AD is a side of the rectangle, which is 24 units. Wait, but in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, actually, AD is a side of the rectangle, so in triangle AXD, side AD is fixed at 24. But since A is (0,0) and D is (0,24), so AD is vertical. Then AX is from (0,0) to (x,y), so length sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). XD is from (x,y) to (0,24), so sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2). And AD is 24.\n\nSimilarly, triangle BXC has vertices at B (a,0), X (x,y), and C (a,24). The sides here are BX, XC, and BC (which is 24). The sides are BX from (a,0) to (x,y): sqrt((a - x)^2 + y\u00b2). XC is from (x,y) to (a,24): sqrt((a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2). BC is 24.\n\nGiven that both triangles AXD and BXC have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively.\n\nSo, using the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides of lengths a, b, c:\n\nR = (a b c)/(4 \u0394), where \u0394 is the area of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, since AD and BC are sides of the rectangle, which are 24, perhaps we can use that in the triangles.\n\nLet me first handle triangle AXD. Let's denote its sides as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nIn triangle AXD:\n- Side opposite vertex A: XD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)\n- Side opposite vertex X: AD = 24\n- Side opposite vertex D: AX = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nWait, actually, perhaps labeling them as sides a, b, c with corresponding opposite angles might be better. Alternatively, let me just compute the circumradius formula.\n\nAlternatively, since AD is a side of the triangle AXD, which is 24, and the circumradius is 13, then perhaps using the formula involving sine. For a triangle, the circumradius R is equal to (side)/(2 sin \u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle opposite that side. \n\nSo in triangle AXD, let's pick side AD which is 24. The angle opposite to AD is angle at X, which is angle AX D's angle at X. Wait, angle at X in triangle AXD would be angle AX D's angle at X? Wait, let me clarify:\n\nIn triangle AXD, the vertices are A, X, D. The side AD is opposite to angle at X. So angle at X is opposite to AD (24). So then the circumradius R is related by R = AD / (2 sin(angle at X)). Since R is given as 13, so 13 = 24 / (2 sin(angle at X)), so sin(angle at X) = 24/(2*13) = 12/13. Therefore, angle at X in triangle AXD is arcsin(12/13). Since the triangle is acute, then angle at X must be less than 90\u00b0, but arcsin(12/13) is less than 90\u00b0, so that's okay. \n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC, let's see. The side BC is 24, so the angle opposite to BC is the angle at X in triangle BXC. Let me confirm:\n\nIn triangle BXC, the side BC is opposite to angle at X. So similarly, R = BC / (2 sin(angle at X)). R is given as 15, so 15 = 24/(2 sin(angle at X)), so sin(angle at X) = 24/(2*15) = 24/30 = 4/5. So angle at X in triangle BXC is arcsin(4/5). Since the triangle is acute, angle at X must be less than 90\u00b0, which is true here.\n\nHmm, so now we have some angles related to point X in both triangles. But perhaps there is a better way to use coordinates here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider coordinates and set up equations based on the circumradius formulas.\n\nFirst, let's write down coordinates:\n\nLet me let A = (0, 0), B = (a, 0), D = (0, 24), C = (a, 24). Point X = (x, y) inside the rectangle, so 0 < x < a, 0 < y <24.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so the vectors AX and BX are perpendicular. The vector AX is (x, y) and the vector BX is (x - a, y). Their dot product should be zero:\n\nx*(x - a) + y*y = 0\n\nSo that's equation (1):\n\nx(x - a) + y\u00b2 = 0\n\nWhich simplifies to x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 = 0. Which is the same as before.\n\nNow, moving on to the triangles AXD and BXC.\n\nStarting with triangle AXD. Let me compute its sides:\n\nAX = distance from A to X: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nXD = distance from X to D: sqrt((x - 0)^2 + (y - 24)^2) = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)\n\nAD = distance from A to D: 24, which is fixed.\n\nThe circumradius of triangle AXD is 13. Let me recall that the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides of length a, b, c is R = (a b c)/(4 \u0394), where \u0394 is the area.\n\nAlternatively, since AD is a known side (24), perhaps using the formula R = AD/(2 sin \u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle opposite AD. As I thought earlier, \u03b8 is the angle at X in triangle AXD. So, angle at X is \u03b8, so opposite side AD is 24, so:\n\n13 = AD / (2 sin \u03b8) => 13 = 24/(2 sin \u03b8) => sin \u03b8 = 24/(2*13) = 12/13. Therefore, angle at X in triangle AXD is arcsin(12/13). Since the triangle is acute, angle at X must be less than 90\u00b0, which is true here. \n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC, the side BC is 24, so angle opposite to BC is angle at X in triangle BXC, so:\n\nR = BC / (2 sin \u03c6) where \u03c6 is the angle at X in triangle BXC. So 15 = 24/(2 sin \u03c6) => sin \u03c6 = 24/(2*15) = 4/5. So angle at X is arcsin(4/5). Also acute, since 4/5 < 1 and angle is less than 90\u00b0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates, we can compute the circumradius via coordinates. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's compute the circumradius of triangle AXD. Let me use coordinates for triangle AXD with points A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). The circumradius can be found using the formula:\n\nR = \\frac{|\\vec{AX} \\times \\vec{AD}|}{4\u0394}\n\nWait, perhaps better to use coordinates to compute the circumradius.\n\nThe circumradius can be calculated using the formula for three points.\n\nGiven three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), the circumradius is given by:\n\nR = \\frac{\\sqrt{( (x2 - x1)(y3 - y1) - (x3 - x1)(y2 - y1) )^2 + ...}}{2\u0394}\n\nWait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula for the circumradius in terms of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the circumradius is half the length of the product of two sides divided by the sine of the included angle. Wait, but maybe it's getting too convoluted. Let me try the determinant method.\n\nThe area \u0394 of triangle AXD can be computed as \u00bd | (0*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - y) ) | = \u00bd | 0 + 24x + 0 | = 12x.\n\nWait, let me confirm. The area using coordinates: the three points are A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). Using the shoelace formula:\n\nArea = \u00bd | (0*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - y) ) | = \u00bd |0 +24x +0| = 12x. So \u0394 = 12x.\n\nThen, the sides of triangle AXD are:\n\nAX: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nXD: sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nAD: 24\n\nSo using the formula R = (a b c)/(4 \u0394), where a, b, c are the sides:\n\nHere, let me denote sides as AX, XD, AD. Let me take a = AX, b = XD, c = AD =24.\n\nTherefore:\n\nR_AXD = (AX * XD * AD)/(4 * \u0394) = ( sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * 24 ) / (4 * 12x )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12x = 48x\n\nSo R_AXD = (24 sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )) / (48x) ) = ( sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * 24 ) / (48x )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 24/48 = 1/2, so R_AXD = ( sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ) / (2x ) )\n\nAnd this is given to be 13. So,\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) / (2x ) = 13\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n[ (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / (4x\u00b2 ) = 169\n\nMultiply both sides by 4x\u00b2:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 4x\u00b2 * 169 = 676x\u00b2\n\nHmm, that's one equation. Let's note this as equation (2).\n\nSimilarly, let's do the same for triangle BXC.\n\nTriangle BXC has points B(a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24). Let me compute its area first.\n\nUsing shoelace formula:\n\nArea \u0394 = \u00bd | a*(y -24) + x*(24 -0 ) + a*(0 - y) |\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: a*(y -24)\n\nSecond term: x*(24 - 0) = 24x\n\nThird term: a*(0 - y) = -a y\n\nSo putting it together:\n\n\u0394 = \u00bd | a(y -24) +24x -a y | = \u00bd | a y -24a +24x -a y | = \u00bd | -24a +24x | = \u00bd |24(x - a)| = 12 |x - a|\n\nSince X is inside the rectangle, and since a is the length AB, which is positive, and x is between 0 and a, so x - a is negative, so |x - a| = a -x. Therefore, \u0394 = 12(a -x).\n\nThe sides of triangle BXC are:\n\nBX: sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC: sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nBC: 24\n\nSo the circumradius R_BXC is given by (BX * XC * BC)/(4\u0394) = 15.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n( sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * 24 ) / (4 * 12(a -x) ) ) =15\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12(a -x) = 48(a -x)\n\nSo:\n\n[24 sqrt(...) sqrt(...) ] / [48(a - x) ] = 15\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n24/48 = 1/2, so:\n\n[ sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ) / (2(a -x)) ] =15\n\nAgain, square both sides:\n\n[ ( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) ( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / [4(a -x)^2] = 225\n\nMultiply both sides by 4(a -x)^2:\n\n( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) ( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 900(a -x)^2\n\nLet me note this as equation (3).\n\nSo now, we have equation (1): x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 =0\n\nEquation (2): (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 676x\u00b2\n\nEquation (3): [ ( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) ( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] = 900(a -x)^2\n\nSo this looks quite complicated, but maybe we can use equation (1) to substitute variables here.\n\nFrom equation (1): x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 =0, so rearranged, we have x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x. Let me note this as equation (1a): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x.\n\nTherefore, in equation (2):\n\nLeft side is (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = (a x) [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ]\n\nSet equal to 676x\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\na x [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ] = 676x\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by x (assuming x \u22600, which it can't be because then AX would be 0, but point X is inside the rectangle so x must be between 0 and a, so x is positive):\n\na [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ] = 676x\n\nLet me note this as equation (2a).\n\nSimilarly, looking at equation (3):\n\nLeft side is [ ( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) ( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ]\n\nLet me denote (a - x) as some variable, maybe let\u2019s let u = a - x. Then, since u = a -x, and x is between 0 and a, so u is between 0 and a as well.\n\nLet me try substituting u = a -x. Let me see if that helps.\n\nLet u = a -x, so x = a - u. Then, equation (1a): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x => (a - u)^2 + y\u00b2 = a(a - u)\n\nExpand left side: a\u00b2 - 2a u + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - a u\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na\u00b2 -2a u + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -a\u00b2 + a u =0 \u2192 -a u + u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =0 \u2192 u\u00b2 -a u + y\u00b2 =0\n\nHmm, that's similar to equation (1a) but with u instead of x. Not sure if that helps yet.\n\nBut in equation (3), substituting u =a -x,\n\nLeft side becomes [ (u\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(u\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ]\n\nand right side is 900 u\u00b2\n\nTherefore, equation (3) can be rewritten as:\n\n(u\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(u\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 900 u\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, equation (2a) is:\n\na [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ] = 676x\n\nBut x =a -u, so substituting:\n\na [ (a - u)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] = 676(a -u)\n\nHmm, perhaps this substitution can link equations (2a) and (3). Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since we have equation (1a): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x, so perhaps we can express y\u00b2 in terms of x: y\u00b2 = a x -x\u00b2. Let me do that.\n\nLet me let y\u00b2 = a x -x\u00b2. Then, (24 - y)^2 = 24\u00b2 -48y + y\u00b2 = 576 -48 y + (a x -x\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore, (24 - y)^2 = 576 -48 y + a x -x\u00b2.\n\nBut maybe this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps we can express terms like x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 using equation (1a).\n\nCompute x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = x\u00b2 + 576 -48 y + y\u00b2. From equation (1a), x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x, so substituting:\n\n= a x + 576 -48 y\n\nThus, equation (2a):\n\na [a x + 576 -48 y ] = 676x\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\na\u00b2 x + 576a -48 a y = 676x\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na\u00b2 x -676x + 576a -48a y =0\n\nFactor x terms:\n\nx(a\u00b2 -676) + 576a -48a y =0\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me see equation (3).\n\nEquation (3) in terms of u and y:\n\n(u\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(u\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 900 u\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, let me see if I can express (24 - y)^2 again here.\n\nBut perhaps we can also express y\u00b2 in terms of u and equation (1a). Wait, since u =a -x, and from equation (1a):\n\ny\u00b2 = a x -x\u00b2 =a(a -u) - (a -u)^2 = a\u00b2 -a u - [a\u00b2 -2a u +u\u00b2] = a\u00b2 -a u -a\u00b2 +2a u -u\u00b2 = a u - u\u00b2\n\nSo y\u00b2 =u(a -u)\n\nTherefore, y\u00b2 =a u -u\u00b2. That's an important relation.\n\nTherefore, (24 - y)^2 = 24\u00b2 -48 y + y\u00b2 = 576 -48 y + a u - u\u00b2\n\nHmm, but maybe I can use this substitution to rewrite equation (3):\n\nFirst, equation (3):\n\n(u\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(u\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 900 u\u00b2\n\nWe have y\u00b2 = a u - u\u00b2, so u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + a u -u\u00b2 = a u. So first term is a u.\n\nSecond term: u\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2. Let me compute (24 - y)^2:\n\n(24 - y)^2 = 576 -48 y + y\u00b2. Again, y\u00b2 = a u - u\u00b2, so substitute that:\n\n=576 -48 y + a u - u\u00b2\n\nSo:\n\nu\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 = u\u00b2 +576 -48 y +a u - u\u00b2 =576 -48 y +a u\n\nThus, the second term is 576 -48 y +a u.\n\nTherefore, the product in equation (3):\n\n(a u)(576 -48 y +a u) =900 u\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by u (assuming u \u22600, which is true since X is inside the rectangle, so x <a, so u =a -x >0):\n\na (576 -48 y +a u ) =900 u\n\nExpand left side:\n\n576 a -48 a y +a\u00b2 u =900 u\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n576 a -48 a y +a\u00b2 u -900 u=0\n\nFactor terms with u:\n\nu(a\u00b2 -900) +576 a -48 a y =0\n\nHmm, so now we have two equations:\n\nFrom equation (2a) rewritten:\n\nx(a\u00b2 -676) +576a -48a y =0 \u2192 but x =a -u, so substituting:\n\n(a -u)(a\u00b2 -676) +576a -48a y =0\n\nWait, let me note that equation (2a) was:\n\na\u00b2 x -676x +576a -48a y =0 \u2192 (a\u00b2 -676)x +576a -48a y=0\n\nSince x = a -u, substitute:\n\n(a\u00b2 -676)(a -u) +576a -48a y =0\n\nSimilarly, equation from (3):\n\nu(a\u00b2 -900) +576a -48a y=0\n\nSo now, these two equations:\n\n1. (a\u00b2 -676)(a -u) +576a -48a y =0\n\n2. u(a\u00b2 -900) +576a -48a y =0\n\nLet me subtract the second equation from the first to eliminate the terms 576a -48a y.\n\nSo,\n\n[(a\u00b2 -676)(a -u)] - [u(a\u00b2 -900)] =0\n\nExpand the first term:\n\n(a\u00b2 -676)(a) - (a\u00b2 -676)u - u(a\u00b2 -900)=0\n\nFactor terms:\n\na(a\u00b2 -676) - u[(a\u00b2 -676) + (a\u00b2 -900)] =0\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\nFirst term: a(a\u00b2 -676)\n\nSecond term inside brackets: (a\u00b2 -676 + a\u00b2 -900)= 2a\u00b2 -1576\n\nThus:\n\na(a\u00b2 -676) -u(2a\u00b2 -1576)=0\n\nLet me solve for u:\n\nMove the second term to the other side:\n\na(a\u00b2 -676) = u(2a\u00b2 -1576)\n\nTherefore,\n\nu = [a(a\u00b2 -676)] / (2a\u00b2 -1576)\n\nHmm, so now u is expressed in terms of a. Let me note this as equation (4).\n\nNow, let me see if we can find another relation between u and a. Let me recall that y\u00b2 =a u -u\u00b2 from equation (1a) substitution earlier. Also, perhaps from the other equation, equation (3) or (2a).\n\nAlternatively, let's look back at equation (1a): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x, and we had u =a -x. So x =a -u, so substituting into equation (1a):\n\n(a -u)^2 + y\u00b2 =a(a -u)\n\nExpand (a -u)^2: a\u00b2 -2a u +u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a\u00b2 -a u\n\nThen, moving all terms to left:\n\na\u00b2 -2a u +u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -a\u00b2 +a u =0 \u2192 -a u +u\u00b2 + y\u00b2=0 \u2192 y\u00b2 =a u -u\u00b2, which is consistent with what we had before. So that's okay.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find an expression for y in terms of a and u. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if we can use equation (3):\n\nFrom equation (3) after substitution, we had:\n\nu(a\u00b2 -900) +576a -48a y =0 \u2192 let's solve for y:\n\n-48a y = -u(a\u00b2 -900) -576a\n\nDivide both sides by -48a:\n\ny = [u(a\u00b2 -900) +576a]/(48a )\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = [u(a\u00b2 -900) ]/(48a ) +576a/(48a )\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n576a /48a =12, so:\n\ny = [u(a\u00b2 -900)/(48a)] +12\n\nLet me write this as:\n\ny = 12 + [u(a\u00b2 -900)]/(48a )\n\nSimilarly, from equation (2a):\n\nLet me take equation (2a):\n\na\u00b2 x +576a -48a y =676x\n\nWait, equation (2a) was:\n\na\u00b2 x -676x +576a -48a y=0 \u2192 (a\u00b2 -676)x +576a -48a y =0 \u2192 so solving for terms with y:\n\n-48a y = - (a\u00b2 -676)x -576a \u2192 \n\ny = [ (a\u00b2 -676)x +576a ]/(48a )\n\nBut x =a -u, so substituting:\n\ny = [ (a\u00b2 -676)(a -u) +576a ]/(48a )\n\nExpand (a\u00b2 -676)(a -u):\n\n= a(a\u00b2 -676) -u(a\u00b2 -676)\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = [a(a\u00b2 -676) - u(a\u00b2 -676) +576a ]/(48a )\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= [a\u00b3 -676a -u(a\u00b2 -676) +576a ]/(48a )\n\n= [a\u00b3 -676a +576a -u(a\u00b2 -676) ]/(48a )\n\n= [a\u00b3 -100a -u(a\u00b2 -676) ]/(48a )\n\nHmm, so here's an expression for y in terms of a and u. Let me set this equal to the previous expression for y from equation (3):\n\nEquation (3) gives y = 12 + [u(a\u00b2 -900)]/(48a )\n\nEquation (2a) gives y = [a\u00b3 -100a -u(a\u00b2 -676) ]/(48a )\n\nTherefore, setting equal:\n\n12 + [u(a\u00b2 -900)]/(48a ) = [a\u00b3 -100a -u(a\u00b2 -676) ]/(48a )\n\nMultiply both sides by 48a to eliminate denominators:\n\n12*48a + u(a\u00b2 -900) = a\u00b3 -100a -u(a\u00b2 -676)\n\nCompute 12*48a = 576a\n\nSo:\n\n576a + u(a\u00b2 -900) = a\u00b3 -100a -u(a\u00b2 -676)\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n576a + u(a\u00b2 -900) -a\u00b3 +100a +u(a\u00b2 -676)=0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(576a +100a) + u[(a\u00b2 -900) + (a\u00b2 -676)] -a\u00b3=0\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\n576a +100a =676a\n\nInside the brackets for u:\n\n(a\u00b2 -900 +a\u00b2 -676)=2a\u00b2 -1576\n\nTherefore:\n\n676a + u(2a\u00b2 -1576) -a\u00b3 =0\n\nBut from equation (4), we had an expression for u in terms of a:\n\nu = [a(a\u00b2 -676)] / (2a\u00b2 -1576)\n\nLet me substitute this into the above equation.\n\nFirst, substitute u:\n\n676a + [a(a\u00b2 -676)/(2a\u00b2 -1576)]*(2a\u00b2 -1576) -a\u00b3 =0\n\nNotice that (2a\u00b2 -1576) cancels with the denominator:\n\nSo,\n\n676a +a(a\u00b2 -676) -a\u00b3 =0\n\nExpand the second term:\n\na(a\u00b2 -676)=a\u00b3 -676a\n\nThus,\n\n676a +a\u00b3 -676a -a\u00b3 =0 \u2192 0=0\n\nHmm, so it simplifies to 0=0, which is an identity. That means the equations are dependent, so we need another equation to relate a and u.\n\nHmm, so that approach leads to an identity, meaning that we might need another relation to find a.\n\nWait, perhaps we need to use the expression for y and plug into another equation?\n\nAlternatively, let's recall that we have y\u00b2 = a u -u\u00b2 from equation (1a) substitution, and we also have expressions for y in terms of a and u from equations (2a) and (3). Let me see if I can use that.\n\nTake the expression from equation (3):\n\ny =12 + [u(a\u00b2 -900)]/(48a )\n\nLet me square both sides to get y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 = [12 + (u(a\u00b2 -900))/(48a) ]\u00b2 \n\nExpand the square:\n\n=12\u00b2 + 2*12*(u(a\u00b2 -900))/(48a ) + [u(a\u00b2 -900)/(48a)]\u00b2\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n=144 + (24 u(a\u00b2 -900))/(48a ) + [u\u00b2(a\u00b2 -900)^2]/(48a)^2\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n24/48 = 0.5, so:\n\n=144 + [0.5 u(a\u00b2 -900)/a ] + [u\u00b2(a\u00b2 -900)^2]/(2304a\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, this might be messy, but let me note that y\u00b2 is also equal to a u - u\u00b2 from earlier.\n\nTherefore,\n\na u - u\u00b2 =144 + (u(a\u00b2 -900))/(2a ) + [u\u00b2(a\u00b2 -900)^2]/(2304a\u00b2 )\n\nThis seems very complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the earlier substitution for u in terms of a from equation (4):\n\nu = [a(a\u00b2 -676)]/(2a\u00b2 -1576)\n\nLet me substitute this into the expression for y\u00b2 =a u -u\u00b2.\n\nFirst compute a u:\n\na u =a * [a(a\u00b2 -676)/(2a\u00b2 -1576) ] = [a\u00b2(a\u00b2 -676)]/(2a\u00b2 -1576)\n\nThen u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 = [a\u00b2(a\u00b2 -676)^2 ]/(2a\u00b2 -1576)^2\n\nTherefore,\n\ny\u00b2 =a u -u\u00b2 = [a\u00b2(a\u00b2 -676)/(2a\u00b2 -1576)] - [a\u00b2(a\u00b2 -676)^2 ]/(2a\u00b2 -1576)^2 )\n\nFactor out [a\u00b2(a\u00b2 -676)/(2a\u00b2 -1576)^2 ]:\n\ny\u00b2 = [a\u00b2(a\u00b2 -676)/(2a\u00b2 -1576)^2 ] [ (2a\u00b2 -1576) - (a\u00b2 -676) ]\n\nCompute the bracket term:\n\n(2a\u00b2 -1576) - (a\u00b2 -676) = a\u00b2 - 1576 +676 = a\u00b2 -900\n\nTherefore,\n\ny\u00b2 = [a\u00b2(a\u00b2 -676)(a\u00b2 -900) ] / (2a\u00b2 -1576)^2 )\n\nBut also, from equation (3):\n\nLet me recall that equation (3):\n\n(u\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(u\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =900 u\u00b2\n\nWait, but maybe I can use the expression for y\u00b2 here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps go back to the expressions for equations (2a) and (3) and see if there's a way to form an equation purely in terms of a.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of equation (2):\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 676x\u00b2\n\nBut from equation (1a), x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x. So substituting:\n\n(a x)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =676x\u00b2 \u2192 a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =676x\n\nWhich is exactly equation (2a). Similarly, equation (3) can be expressed as:\n\n( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =900(a -x)^2\n\nBut since we have u =a -x, then (a -x)^2 =u\u00b2, so:\n\n( u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 )(u\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =900u\u00b2\n\nWhich is equation (3). \n\nBut perhaps if I can write both equations (2a) and (3) in terms of u and a, then use the relation between u and a from equation (4):\n\nu = [a(a\u00b2 -676)]/(2a\u00b2 -1576)\n\nLet me try substituting this into equation (3):\n\nEquation (3):\n\n(u\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(u\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =900u\u00b2\n\nBut as before, u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a u (from substitution earlier). And (24 - y)^2 =576 -48 y + y\u00b2. So,\n\nu\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 =576 -48 y + y\u00b2 +u\u00b2. But y\u00b2 =a u -u\u00b2, so substituting that:\n\n=576 -48 y +a u -u\u00b2 +u\u00b2 =576 -48 y +a u.\n\nSo, as before, the first term is a u, the second term is (576 -48 y +a u), so the product is a u*(576 -48 y +a u)=900u\u00b2.\n\nDivide both sides by u (non-zero):\n\na*(576 -48 y +a u)=900u\n\nWhich brings us back to the earlier equation. So we need another way.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that both equations (2a) and (3) can be written in terms of a and u, and since we have u in terms of a from equation (4), maybe we can substitute that into equation (2a) and form an equation purely in terms of a.\n\nWait, let me see equation (2a):\n\na [x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ] =676x\n\nBut x =a - u, so:\n\na [ (a -u)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] =676(a -u)\n\nLet me expand (a -u)^2: a\u00b2 -2a u +u\u00b2, so:\n\na [a\u00b2 -2a u +u\u00b2 + (24 -y)^2 ] =676(a -u)\n\nBut (24 -y)^2 can be expressed as 576 -48y + y\u00b2, so substitute:\n\na [a\u00b2 -2a u +u\u00b2 +576 -48y + y\u00b2 ] =676(a -u)\n\nAgain, y\u00b2 =a u -u\u00b2, so substitute that in:\n\na [a\u00b2 -2a u +u\u00b2 +576 -48y +a u -u\u00b2 ] =676(a -u)\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nInside the brackets:\n\na\u00b2 -2a u +u\u00b2 +576 -48y +a u -u\u00b2 =a\u00b2 -a u +576 -48y\n\nThus,\n\na [a\u00b2 -a u +576 -48y ] =676(a -u)\n\nLet me substitute y from the expression obtained earlier from equation (3):\n\ny =12 + [u(a\u00b2 -900)]/(48a )\n\nSo plug this into the equation:\n\na [a\u00b2 -a u +576 -48*(12 + [u(a\u00b2 -900)]/(48a )) ] =676(a -u )\n\nSimplify the terms inside:\n\nFirst, compute the 48*(12 + ...):\n\n=48*12 +48*[u(a\u00b2 -900)/(48a ) ]\n\n=576 + [u(a\u00b2 -900)/a ]\n\nThus,\n\nInside the brackets:\n\na\u00b2 -a u +576 - [576 + u(a\u00b2 -900)/a ]\n\n= a\u00b2 -a u +576 -576 - [u(a\u00b2 -900)/a ]\n\n= a\u00b2 -a u - [u(a\u00b2 -900)/a ]\n\nFactor terms:\n\n= a\u00b2 - u [ a + (a\u00b2 -900)/a ]\n\n= a\u00b2 - u [ (a\u00b2 +a\u00b2 -900)/a ]\n\n= a\u00b2 - u [ (2a\u00b2 -900)/a ]\n\nTherefore, the entire equation becomes:\n\na [ a\u00b2 - u*(2a\u00b2 -900)/a ] =676(a -u )\n\nSimplify left side:\n\na*(a\u00b2) -a*u*(2a\u00b2 -900)/a = a\u00b3 - u(2a\u00b2 -900 )\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b3 -u(2a\u00b2 -900 ) =676(a -u )\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na\u00b3 -u(2a\u00b2 -900 ) -676a +676u =0\n\nFactor terms with u:\n\nu(-2a\u00b2 +900 +676 ) +a\u00b3 -676a =0\n\nCompute inside the u coefficient:\n\n-2a\u00b2 +900 +676 = -2a\u00b2 +1576\n\nThus,\n\nu*(-2a\u00b2 +1576 ) +a\u00b3 -676a =0\n\nNow, substitute u from equation (4):\n\nu = [a(a\u00b2 -676)]/(2a\u00b2 -1576) = [a(a\u00b2 -676)] / [ - ( -2a\u00b2 +1576 ) ]\n\nWait, note that 2a\u00b2 -1576 = - ( -2a\u00b2 +1576 )\n\nThus, u = [ a(a\u00b2 -676) ] / (2a\u00b2 -1576) = [ a(a\u00b2 -676) ] / [ - ( -2a\u00b2 +1576 ) ]\n\nHence, substituting into the equation:\n\n[ a(a\u00b2 -676) / (2a\u00b2 -1576) ] * (-2a\u00b2 +1576 ) +a\u00b3 -676a =0\n\nNote that (2a\u00b2 -1576) is denominator, and (-2a\u00b2 +1576 ) is numerator's second term. Let me write this as:\n\n[ a(a\u00b2 -676) * (-2a\u00b2 +1576) ) / (2a\u00b2 -1576) ] +a\u00b3 -676a =0\n\nNotice that (-2a\u00b2 +1576) = - (2a\u00b2 -1576), so:\n\n= [ a(a\u00b2 -676) * (-1)(2a\u00b2 -1576) ) / (2a\u00b2 -1576) ) ] +a\u00b3 -676a\n\nThe (2a\u00b2 -1576) terms cancel:\n\n= [ -a(a\u00b2 -676) ] +a\u00b3 -676a =0\n\nExpand -a(a\u00b2 -676):\n\n= -a\u00b3 +676a +a\u00b3 -676a =0 \u2192 0=0\n\nAgain, another identity. Hmm. This suggests that all these equations are dependent and we need another approach.\n\nPerhaps now is the time to consider that both equations (2) and (3) can be related through the coordinates and the angle AXB=90\u00b0.\n\nWe know from equation (1) that x\u00b2 -a x + y\u00b2 =0, so that gives a relationship between x and y.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of coordinate geometry and use the two equations for the circumradii.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider triangles AXD and BXC and use the fact that their circumradii are 13 and 15, respectively. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. However, these triangles are both acute, so they are not right-angled. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates to write the equations for the circumcircles of triangles AXD and BXC and find the point X lying on both?\n\nWait, the circumradius is given, so perhaps the circumcircle of triangle AXD has radius 13, so the distance from the circumcenter to each vertex (A, X, D) is 13. Similarly for BXC.\n\nHmm, maybe this is a better approach. Let me try.\n\nFirst, for triangle AXD, its circumradius is 13. Let me find the circumcenter and set its distance to A, X, D as 13.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nLet me start with triangle AXD. The circumradius is 13. Let me denote the circumcenter of triangle AXD as O1, then O1 is equidistant from A, X, D, each distance being 13.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC with circumradius 15: circumcenter O2 is equidistant from B, X, C at 15.\n\nThis might be a way to set up equations.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFirst, coordinates of points:\n\nA(0,0), D(0,24), X(x,y). The circumradius of AXD is 13.\n\nSo the circumcenter O1 must be equidistant from A, X, D, each distance 13.\n\nLet O1 be at (h1, k1). Then:\n\nDistance from O1 to A: sqrt( (h1)^2 + (k1)^2 ) =13 \u2192 h1\u00b2 +k1\u00b2 =169 (1)\n\nDistance from O1 to D: sqrt( (h1 -0)^2 + (k1 -24)^2 ) =13 \u2192 h1\u00b2 + (k1 -24)^2 =169 (2)\n\nDistance from O1 to X: sqrt( (h1 -x)^2 + (k1 - y)^2 ) =13 \u2192 (h1 -x)^2 + (k1 - y)^2 =169 (3)\n\nSubtract equation (1) from (2):\n\n[ h1\u00b2 + (k1 -24)^2 ] - [h1\u00b2 +k1\u00b2 ] =0 \u2192 (k1 -24)^2 -k1\u00b2 =0 \u2192 expanding:\n\nk1\u00b2 -48k1 +576 -k1\u00b2 = -48k1 +576 =0 \u2192 -48k1 +576=0 \u2192k1=12.\n\nSo the y-coordinate of O1 is 12. Therefore, O1 is (h1, 12). Then from equation (1):\n\nh1\u00b2 +12\u00b2 =169 \u2192 h1\u00b2=169-144=25 \u2192 h1=\u00b15.\n\nTherefore, the circumcenter O1 is either (5,12) or (-5,12). However, since the rectangle is from x=0 to x=a, and point X is inside the rectangle (so x between 0 and a), the circumcenter O1 must be such that it can also be equidistant to X. Let me see.\n\nIf O1 were at (-5,12), then the distance to A(0,0) is 13, which is okay, but the distance to D(0,24) is also 13, and to X(x,y). But since the rectangle's left side is at x=0, having a circumcenter at (-5,12) would be outside the rectangle. However, the circumcenter doesn't necessarily have to be inside the rectangle, but the triangle AXD has vertices at A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). The circumradius is 13, so if the center is at (-5,12), that's possible even if it's outside the rectangle. But let's see.\n\nSimilarly, the other option is (5,12). Let me note both possibilities.\n\nSo O1 is either (5,12) or (-5,12).\n\nSimilarly, let's proceed with both possibilities and see.\n\nCase 1: O1 is (5,12)\n\nThen, the third equation (distance to X):\n\n(5 -x)^2 + (12 - y)^2 =169.\n\nCase 2: O1 is (-5,12)\n\nThen, (-5 -x)^2 + (12 - y)^2 =169.\n\nWe need to check which one is valid.\n\nAdditionally, since triangle AXD must be acute. The circumradius being 13 and the triangle being acute requires that all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so the circumradius must satisfy certain conditions. For instance, in an acute triangle, the circumradius is less than half the length of the longest side. Wait, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can proceed with both cases and see which one leads to a valid solution.\n\nSimilarly, let's consider the triangle BXC with circumradius 15.\n\nThe circumcenter O2 must be equidistant from B(a,0), X(x,y), and C(a,24), each at distance 15.\n\nLet O2 be (h2, k2). Then:\n\nDistance from O2 to B: sqrt( (h2 -a)^2 + (k2)^2 ) =15 \u2192 (h2 -a)^2 +k2\u00b2 =225 (4)\n\nDistance from O2 to C: sqrt( (h2 -a)^2 + (k2 -24)^2 ) =15 \u2192 (h2 -a)^2 + (k2 -24)^2 =225 (5)\n\nDistance from O2 to X: sqrt( (h2 -x)^2 + (k2 - y)^2 ) =15 \u2192 (h2 -x)^2 + (k2 - y)^2 =225 (6)\n\nSubtract equation (4) from (5):\n\n[ (h2 -a)^2 + (k2 -24)^2 ] - [ (h2 -a)^2 +k2\u00b2 ] =0 \u2192 (k2 -24)^2 -k2\u00b2=0 \u2192 same as before:\n\n-48k2 +576 =0 \u2192k2=12.\n\nThus, the y-coordinate of O2 is also 12. Then, from equation (4):\n\n(h2 -a)^2 +12\u00b2=225 \u2192 (h2 -a)^2=225 -144=81 \u2192 h2 -a=\u00b19 \u2192 h2=a\u00b19.\n\nThus, O2 is either (a+9,12) or (a-9,12).\n\nAgain, check validity. Since the triangle BXC has points B(a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24). The circumcenter can be at (a+9,12) or (a-9,12). (a+9,12) is to the right of the rectangle, (a-9,12) is to the left, but since X is inside the rectangle (x <a), perhaps either is possible.\n\nProceeding with both possibilities.\n\nSo, for triangle BXC:\n\nCase 1: O2 is (a+9,12)\n\nThen equation (6): (a+9 -x)^2 + (12 - y)^2 =225.\n\nCase 2: O2 is (a-9,12)\n\nThen equation (6): (a-9 -x)^2 + (12 - y)^2 =225.\n\nNow, we can combine these equations with the previous ones.\n\nLet me first consider the first case for O1 and O2:\n\nCase 1: O1 is (5,12); O2 is (a+9,12)\n\nThen, equations from O1:\n\n(5 -x)^2 + (12 - y)^2 =169 (Equation A)\n\nFrom O2:\n\n(a+9 -x)^2 + (12 - y)^2 =225 (Equation B)\n\nSubtract equation A from B:\n\n[ (a+9 -x)^2 + (12 - y)^2 ] - [ (5 -x)^2 + (12 - y)^2 ] =225 -169 \u2192 (a+9 -x)^2 - (5 -x)^2 =56\n\nExpand both squares:\n\nLet me denote (a+9 -x)^2 = ( (a+9 -x) )\u00b2 = ( (a -x) +9 )\u00b2 = (a -x)^2 +18(a -x) +81\n\nSimilarly, (5 -x)^2 = (5 -x)^2. \n\nThus,\n\n[ (a -x)^2 +18(a -x)+81 ] - (5 -x)^2 =56\n\nExpand (5 -x)^2 =25 -10x +x\u00b2. Wait, but perhaps better to expand all terms:\n\nLet me compute (a+9 -x)^2 - (5 -x)^2:\n\nLet me let u =a+9 -x and v=5 -x, then u\u00b2 -v\u00b2 = (u -v)(u +v). \n\nCompute u -v = (a+9 -x) - (5 -x)=a+9 -x -5 +x= a+4\n\nu +v= (a+9 -x)+(5 -x)=a+14 -2x\n\nThus,\n\n(a+4)(a+14 -2x) =56.\n\nHmm, that's one equation. Let me write this:\n\n(a+4)(a +14 -2x)=56 \u2192 equation C.\n\nAdditionally, from equation A: (5 -x)^2 + (12 - y)^2 =169\n\nBut also, we have the original equation from angle AXB=90\u00b0, which is equation (1): x\u00b2 -a x + y\u00b2=0 \u2192 y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2. \n\nLet me also note that from equation A:\n\n(5 -x)^2 + (12 - y)^2 =169 \u2192 expand:\n\n25 -10x +x\u00b2 +144 -24y + y\u00b2 =169 \u2192 (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -10x -24y +169 =169 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x -24y =0\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x from equation (1a):\n\nThus,\n\na x -10x -24y =0 \u2192 x(a -10) -24 y =0 \u2192 equation D: x(a -10) =24 y \u2192 y= [x(a -10)] /24\n\nSo that's y expressed in terms of x and a.\n\nNow, let me also consider equation C: (a+4)(a +14 -2x)=56.\n\nAdditionally, from equation (1a): y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2. \n\nLet me see if we can substitute y from equation D into equation (1a):\n\ny = [x(a -10)] /24 \u2192 y\u00b2 =x\u00b2(a -10)^2/(24)^2\n\nThus,\n\na x -x\u00b2 =x\u00b2(a -10)^2/(24)^2 \u2192 \n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\na x -x\u00b2 -x\u00b2(a -10)^2/(24)^2 =0 \u2192 x [ a -x -x ( (a -10)^2 )/(24)^2 ]=0\n\nSince x\u22600 (as X is inside the rectangle), then:\n\na -x -x*( (a-10)^2 )/(24)^2 =0 \u2192 \n\na -x =x*( (a-10)^2 )/(24)^2 \u2192 \n\na =x [1 + ( (a-10)^2 )/(24)^2 ] \u2192 \n\nHmm, this might be complex, but perhaps we can combine with equation C.\n\nLet me also note equation C:\n\n(a+4)(a +14 -2x)=56 \u2192 Let me solve for x in terms of a:\n\nLet me denote term inside: a +14 -2x = (a +14 -2x).

Let me attempt this.\n\nFirst, compute x from equation E:\n\nLet me write x as:\n\nx = [ (a +14)(a+4) -56 ] / [2(a+4) ]\n\nWait, actually, let me compute numerator of x:\n\na +14 - 56/(a+4) = ( (a +14)(a +4) -56 ) / (a+4)\n\nLet me verify:\n\n(a +14)(a+4) = a\u00b2 +18a +56. Then subtract 56 gives a\u00b2 +18a.\n\nThus,\n\nx = (a\u00b2 +18a ) / [ 2(a+4) ]\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, (a +14)(a+4) = a\u00b2 +4a +14a +56 =a\u00b2 +18a +56. Then subtract 56: a\u00b2 +18a. Yes. So,\n\nx= (a\u00b2 +18a ) / [2(a+4) ] \n\nSo x= [a(a +18)]/[2(a+4)]\n\nOkay, that's better.\n\nThus,\n\nx = [a(a +18)]/[2(a+4)]\n\nTherefore, we can write x in terms of a.\n\nThen, from equation D: y = [x(a -10)] /24 \u2192 substitute x:\n\ny = [ (a(a +18)/[2(a+4) ]) * (a -10) ] /24\n\nSimplify:\n\ny = [ a(a +18)(a -10) ] / [ 2(a+4)*24 ]\n\nSimplify denominator: 2*24=48 \u2192 denominator is 48(a+4)\n\nSo,\n\ny = [ a(a +18)(a -10) ] / [48(a+4) ]\n\nNow, let's plug x and y into equation (1a): y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2.\n\nFirst compute a x -x\u00b2:\n\na x -x\u00b2 =x(a -x)\n\nWe have x= [a(a +18)]/[2(a+4) ]\n\nThus,\n\na -x = a - [a(a +18)]/[2(a+4) ] = [2a(a+4) -a(a +18) ]/[2(a+4) ]\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n2a(a+4) =2a\u00b2 +8a\n\na(a +18)=a\u00b2 +18a\n\nThus,\n\nNumerator:2a\u00b2 +8a -a\u00b2 -18a= a\u00b2 -10a\n\nThus,\n\na -x = (a\u00b2 -10a)/[2(a+4) ]\n\nHence,\n\na x -x\u00b2= x*(a -x)= [ a(a +18)/[2(a+4) ] ] * [ (a\u00b2 -10a)/[2(a+4) ] ]\n\nMultiply numerators and denominators:\n\n= [a(a +18)(a\u00b2 -10a) ] / [4(a+4)^2 ]\n\nNow, compute y\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2= [ a(a +18)(a -10)/[48(a+4) ] ]^2 = [a\u00b2(a +18)^2(a -10)^2 ]/[48\u00b2(a+4)^2 ]\n\nSet equal to a x -x\u00b2:\n\n[ a\u00b2(a +18)^2(a -10)^2 ]/[48\u00b2(a+4)^2 ] = [a(a +18)(a\u00b2 -10a) ] / [4(a+4)^2 ]\n\nMultiply both sides by 48\u00b2(a+4)^2 to eliminate denominators:\n\na\u00b2(a +18)^2(a -10)^2 = [a(a +18)(a\u00b2 -10a) ] * 48\u00b2 /4\n\nSimplify right side:\n\n48\u00b2 /4 = (48/2)^2 =24\u00b2 =576. Wait, 48\u00b2 /4 is (48)^2 divided by 4, which is (2304)/4=576. So,\n\nRight side: a(a +18)(a\u00b2 -10a)*576\n\nThus,\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2(a+18)^2(a-10)^2\n\nRight side: 576a(a+18)(a(a -10))\n\nSimplify both sides:\n\nDivide both sides by a(a+18), assuming a \u22600 and a +18 \u22600 (which it isn't since a is the length of AB, so positive).\n\nLeft side becomes: a(a+18)(a-10)^2\n\nRight side becomes: 576(a(a -10))\n\nThus,\n\na(a+18)(a-10)^2 =576a(a -10)\n\nDivide both sides by a(a -10), assuming a \u22600 and a \u226010 (we can check later if a=10 is a solution, but likely not):\n\nLeft: (a+18)(a -10)\n\nRight: 576\n\nThus,\n\n(a+18)(a -10) =576\n\nExpand left side:\n\na\u00b2 -10a +18a -180 =a\u00b2 +8a -180 =576\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 +8a -180 -576 =0 \u2192 a\u00b2 +8a -756 =0\n\nSolve quadratic equation:\n\na = [ -8 \u00b1\u221a(64 +4*756) ]/2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n64 +4*756 =64 +3024=3088\n\n\u221a3088: Let me see, 3088 divided by 16 is 193, so \u221a3088 =4\u221a193. Hmm, that's irrational. But the problem likely expects an integer answer. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, let me verify all steps carefully.\n\nStarting from equation (1a): y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2.\n\nThen, after substituting x and y in terms of a, we arrived at the equation:\n\n(a+18)(a -10)=576\n\nWait let me check the steps again.\n\nStarting from:\n\nAfter dividing both sides by a(a+18)(a -10), but let me check the previous steps.\n\nWait, let me retrace the steps where I had:\n\nLeft side: a(a+18)(a-10)^2\n\nRight side:576a(a -10)\n\nThen dividing both sides by a(a -10):\n\nLeft: (a+18)(a -10)\n\nRight: 576\n\nHence,\n\n(a+18)(a -10)=576\n\nYes, that step is correct.\n\nThen expanding gives:\n\na\u00b2 +8a -180 =576 \u2192 a\u00b2 +8a -756=0\n\nSolving quadratic equation a\u00b2 +8a -756 =0\n\nDiscriminant D=64 +4*756=64+3024=3088\n\n\u221a3088: Let me see, 55\u00b2=3025, 56\u00b2=3136. So between 55 and 56. 55.5\u00b2=3080.25, which is close. 55.5\u00b2= (55 +0.5)^2=55\u00b2 +55 +0.25=3025+55+0.25=3080.25. 3080.25 vs 3088. The difference is 7.75, so sqrt(3088)=\u224855.56. Not a whole number. Hmm, but the problem probably expects an integer answer. Therefore, perhaps there was an error in the case assumption.\n\nSince we took O1 as (5,12) and O2 as (a+9,12). Maybe that combination is not valid. Let me check the other cases.\n\nCase 1 for O1 was (5,12), and Case 1 for O2 was (a+9,12). Maybe instead, O1 is (-5,12) and O2 is (a-9,12).

Maybe the problem expects an answer which is 26? Wait, but 26 squared is 676. Wait, in equation (4), we had u = [a(a\u00b2 -676)]/(2a\u00b2 -1576). If a\u00b2 was 676, which is 26\u00b2, then numerator becomes zero, so u=0, but then X would be at x=a, which is point B, but X is inside the rectangle, so that can't be. Alternatively, if the length is 25?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the problem again. Wait, the problem says that both triangles are acute. In my first case, when I took O1 as (5,12), then the circumradius is 13, which might correspond to a=25?\n\nWait let me suppose a=25.\n\nLet me test a=25 in the first case (O1=(5,12), O2=(a+9,12)= (34,12))\n\nThen equation C: (a+4)(a+14 -2x)=56 \u2192 (25+4)(25+14 -2x)=29*(39 -2x)=56 \u2192 29*(39 -2x)=56 \u2192 39-2x=56/29\u22481.93 \u2192 2x\u224839-1.93\u224837.07 \u2192x\u224818.53\n\nThen y= [x(a-10)]/24 \u2192 a-10=15, so y\u224818.53*15/24\u2248(277.95)/24\u224811.58\n\nThen check equation (1a): y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2 \u2192 y\u00b2\u224811.58\u00b2\u2248134, while a x -x\u00b2=25*18.53 - (18.53)^2\u2248463.25 -343.36\u2248119.89. Close but not exact, discrepancy due to approximate values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value is a=25?\n\nLet me try a=25 in equation (a+18)(a-10)=576 \u2192 (25+18)(25-10)=43*15=645\u2260576. Not.\n\nWait, a\u00b2 +8a=756 for first case: a\u00b2+8a=756 \u2192 if a=26, 26\u00b2+8*26=676+208=884>756. a=24: 24\u00b2+8*24=576+192=768 close but over. a=23: 529+184=713 <756. So no integer solution.\n\nWait, maybe the problem requires the answer as 26? Because 26\u00b2=676 which appears in equation (4). Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 25?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait let's consider that the problem states that both triangles are acute. In the case where the circumradius is 13 for triangle AXD, which has side AD=24. Since in a triangle, the circumradius R = a/(2 sin A), where a is the side opposite angle A. Here, side AD=24 is opposite angle at X. Since the triangle is acute, angle at X must be less than 90\u00b0, so sin(angle X) > sin(90\u00b0)=1? Wait no, wait angle X is less than 90\u00b0, so sin(angle X) <1. Wait, but earlier we had sin(angle X)=12/13 <1, which is okay. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the coordinates must satisfy the acute conditions for the other angles. Perhaps this would lead to constraints on a.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach altogether.\n\nLet me think of using coordinate system and set variables differently.\n\nLet me consider that in rectangle ABCD, AB =a, BC=24. Let me set coordinates as before: A(0,0), B(a,0), D(0,24), C(a,24). Point X(x,y) inside.\n\nWe have angle AXB=90\u00b0, so X lies on the circle with diameter AB: equation x\u00b2 -a x + y\u00b2 =0.\n\nTriangles AXD and BXC have circumradii 13 and 15, respectively, and are acute.\n\nLet me recall that for any triangle, the circumradius R = abc/(4\u0394). Let's try to apply this to both triangles.\n\nFirst triangle AXD:\n\nSides:\n\nAX: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nXD: sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nAD:24\n\nArea \u0394 =12x (from earlier)\n\nThus, R_AXD = (AX * XD * AD)/(4\u0394) = (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)*sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2)*24)/(48x) = [sqrt((x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )) *24]/48x = [sqrt((x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )) * 24 ]/(48x) = sqrt((x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ))/(2x ) =13\n\nWhich is the same as equation (2).\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC:\n\nSides:\n\nBX: sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC: sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nBC:24\n\nArea \u0394 =12(a -x)\n\nThus, R_BXC = (BX * XC * BC)/(4\u0394) = [ sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )*sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )*24 ]/(48(a -x) ) = same as equation (3).\n\nThus, the equations are consistent.\n\nLet me consider the following substitution from equation (1a): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x \u2192 y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2\n\nLet me substitute this into equation (2):\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =676x\u00b2\n\nSubstitute y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2:\n\n(a x)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )=676x\u00b2 \u2192 a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )=676x\n\nSimilarly, expand (24 - y)^2 =576 -48y + y\u00b2=576 -48y +a x -x\u00b2.\n\nHence:\n\nx\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 =x\u00b2 +576 -48y +a x -x\u00b2 = a x +576 -48y\n\nSo,\n\na(a x +576 -48y ) =676x \u2192 a\u00b2 x +576a -48a y =676x \u2192 equation (2a).\n\nSimilarly, in equation (3), we can do the same:\n\nLet me denote u =a -x, so x =a -u. Then y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2 =a(a -u) - (a -u)^2 =a\u00b2 -a u -a\u00b2 +2a u -u\u00b2= a u -u\u00b2.\n\nThen (24 - y)^2 =576 -48y +y\u00b2=576 -48y +a u -u\u00b2.\n\nThus, the term (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 =u\u00b2 +576 -48y +a u -u\u00b2=576 -48y +a u.\n\nSo equation (3) becomes:\n\n(u\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(u\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )=900u\u00b2\n\nBut y\u00b2 =a u -u\u00b2 and (24 - y)^2 as above, so substituting:\n\n(a u)(576 -48y +a u)=900u\u00b2 \u2192 a(576 -48y +a u)=900u \u2192 equation (3a).\n\nNow, from equation (2a):\n\na\u00b2x +576a -48a y =676x \u2192 a\u00b2(a -u) +576a -48a y =676(a -u)\n\nExpand:\n\na\u00b3 -a\u00b2 u +576a -48a y =676a -676u\n\nRearranged:\n\na\u00b3 -a\u00b2 u +576a -48a y -676a +676u =0 \u2192 a\u00b3 -a\u00b2 u -98a -48a y +676u =0 \u2192 equation (2b).\n\nFrom equation (3a):\n\na(576 -48y +a u)=900u \u2192576a -48a y +a\u00b2 u=900u \u2192 equation (3b).\n\nNow, we have two equations: (2b) and (3b):\n\nEquation (2b): a\u00b3 -a\u00b2 u -98a -48a y +676u =0\n\nEquation (3b):576a -48a y +a\u00b2 u -900u =0\n\nLet me solve equation (3b) for -48a y:\n\n-48a y = -576a -a\u00b2 u +900u \u2192 -48a y = -a\u00b2 u -576a +900u \u2192 equation (3c).\n\nSubstitute into equation (2b):\n\na\u00b3 -a\u00b2 u -98a + [ -a\u00b2 u -576a +900u ] +676u =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na\u00b3 -a\u00b2 u -98a -a\u00b2 u -576a +900u +676u =0\n\nCombine terms:\n\na\u00b3 -2a\u00b2 u -674a + (900u +676u)=0 \u2192 a\u00b3 -2a\u00b2 u -674a +1576u =0 \u2192 equation (4).\n\nNow, from equation (3b):\n\n576a -48a y +a\u00b2 u =900u \u2192 rearranged: a\u00b2 u -900u +576a -48a y =0 \u2192 u(a\u00b2 -900) +576a -48a y =0 \u2192 equation (5).\n\nFrom equation (3c) we had:\n\n-48a y = -a\u00b2 u -576a +900u \u2192 multiply both sides by (-1):\n\n48a y = a\u00b2 u +576a -900u \u2192 y = [a\u00b2 u +576a -900u]/(48a )\n\n\u2192 y = [a u\u00b2 +576a -900u ]/(48a )?

So this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can solve equations (4) and (5) together.\n\nFrom equation (5): u(a\u00b2 -900) +576a -48a y =0 \u2192 solve for u:\n\nu(a\u00b2 -900) =48a y -576a \u2192 u= [48a y -576a]/(a\u00b2 -900 )\n\nSubstitute this into equation (4):\n\na\u00b3 -2a\u00b2 u -674a +1576u =0 \u2192 substitute u:\n\na\u00b3 -2a\u00b2 [ (48a y -576a)/(a\u00b2 -900) ] -674a +1576[ (48a y -576a)/(a\u00b2 -900) ] =0\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Perhaps there is a smarter substitution.\n\nLet me recall from equation (1a): y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2 =a(a -u ) - (a -u )\u00b2 =a\u00b2 -a u -a\u00b2 +2a u -u\u00b2 =a u -u\u00b2.\n\nThus, y\u00b2 =a u -u\u00b2 \u2192 y= sqrt(a u -u\u00b2 )\n\nBut this might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, note that from equation (3b):\n\na\u00b2 u -900u +576a -48a y=0 \u2192 a\u00b2 u -900u = -576a +48a y \u2192 u(a\u00b2 -900)=48a(y -12).\n\nLet me denote (y -12) as some term.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that the value of a is such that a\u00b2 -900 and a\u00b2 -676 are factors related to the problem?\n\nWait, 676 is 26\u00b2, 900 is 30\u00b2. Maybe a is between 26 and 30?\n\nWait, if a=25, then a\u00b2 -676=625-676=-51, a\u00b2-900=625-900=-275.\n\nAlternatively, a=24: a\u00b2-676=576-676=-100, a\u00b2-900=576-900=-324.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equations can be manipulated to factor.\n\nLooking back at equation (a+18)(a-10)=576.\n\nWait in the first case, we had (a+18)(a -10)=576, which would give a quadratic equation with solutions a=(-18 and 10) shifted.\n\nLet me see:\n\n(a+18)(a -10)=576 \u2192 a\u00b2+8a -180=576 \u2192 a\u00b2+8a -756=0 \u2192 roots are - (8 \u00b1\u221a(64+3024))/2 = (-8 \u00b1\u221a3088)/2.

Not.\n\nAlternatively, equation (a-18)(a+10)=576.\n\nLet me try a= 24:\n\n(24-18)(24+10)=6\u00d734=204\u2260576.\n\na=28:\n\n(28-18)(28+10)=10\u00d738=380\u2260576.\n\na=30:\n\n(30-18)(30+10)=12\u00d740=480\u2260576.\n\na=32:\n\n(32-18)(32+10)=14\u00d742=588 close.\n\na= 33:15\u00d743=645.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 26, given that 26\u00b2 is 676 which is in equation (4) as a(a\u00b2 -676).\n\nWait, if a=26, then:\n\nu = [a(a\u00b2 -676)]/(2a\u00b2 -1576) \u2192 26*(676 -676)=0 \u2192 u=0. But then x =a -u =26, but point X would be at x=26 which is at point B, but X is inside the rectangle. So invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 25, and the problem allows for an approximate solution, but since it's a competition problem, it must be an integer. Maybe I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait let me re-express equation (a+18)(a-10)=576.\n\nExpand:\n\na\u00b2+8a -180=576 \u2192a\u00b2+8a=756. Let me see a\u00b2+8a+16=772 \u2192 (a+4)^2=772 \u2192 a+4=\u221a772 \u224827.78 \u2192a\u224823.78, which matches the prior result.\n\nSimilarly, the other case gives a\u00b2 -8a=756 \u2192a\u00b2-8a+16=772 \u2192 (a-4)^2=772 \u2192a-4=27.78 \u2192a\u224831.78.\n\nPerhaps the problem requires an approximate answer, but likely I missed something.\n\nWait going back to the problem statement:\n\nTriangles AXD and BXC are both acute. The circumradius of AXD is 13 and BXC is 15.\n\nMaybe there's a property or theorem I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinate geometry with the following:\n\nLet me denote AB =a, so coordinates as before.\n\nWe have angle AXB=90\u00b0, so X lies on the circle with diameter AB: equation x\u00b2 -a x + y\u00b2=0.\n\nTriangles AXD and BXC have circumradii 13 and 15.\n\nThe circumradius of AXD is 13, so the distance from the circumcenter to A is 13.\n\nThe circumcenter of AXD lies at the perpendicular bisector of AD and AX.\n\nWait, AD is vertical from (0,0) to (0,24), so its perpendicular bisector is the horizontal line through midpoint (0,12).\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of AX: midpoint of AX is (x/2, y/2). The slope of AX is y/x, so the perpendicular bisector has slope -x/y.\n\nThe circumcenter lies at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AD and AX.\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of AD is the line y=12.\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of AX passes through (x/2, y/2) with slope -x/y.\n\nSo equation of perpendicular bisector of AX is:\n\n(y - y/2) = (-x/y)(x -x/2 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y/2) = (-x/y)(x/2)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2y:\n\ny\u00b2 = -x\u00b2\n\nWait that can't be right. Hmm, perhaps miscalculation.\n\nLet me re-derive the equation of the perpendicular bisector of AX:\n\nThe line perpendicular to AX through midpoint (x/2, y/2).\n\nThe slope of AX is (y -0)/(x -0) = y/x, so the perpendicular slope is -x/y.\n\nThus, equation: (Y - y/2) = (-x/y)(X - x/2 )\n\nWe need this line to intersect the perpendicular bisector of AD, which is Y=12.\n\nSubstitute Y=12 into the equation:\n\n12 - y/2 = (-x/y)(X -x/2)\n\nSolve for X:\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\n12 - y/2 = (-x/y)(X -x/2)\n\nMultiply both sides by y:\n\ny*(12 - y/2 ) = -x(X -x/2 )\n\nExpand left side:\n\n12y - (y\u00b2)/2 = -xX + (x\u00b2)/2\n\nRearrange:\n\nxX = (x\u00b2)/2 +12y - (y\u00b2)/2\n\nThus,\n\nX= [ (x\u00b2)/2 +12y - (y\u00b2)/2 ] /x\n\nBut the circumcenter is at (X,Y)=(X,12).\n\nThe distance from this point to A(0,0) must be 13:\n\nsqrt( X\u00b2 +12\u00b2 ) =13 \u2192 X\u00b2 +144=169 \u2192X\u00b2=25 \u2192X=\u00b15.\n\nThus, the x-coordinate of the circumcenter is either 5 or -5.\n\nSo, from above:\n\nX=5 or X=-5.\n\nThus, two possibilities:\n\nCase 1: X=5:\n\nThen,\n\n5= [ (x\u00b2)/2 +12y - (y\u00b2)/2 ] /x \u2192 multiply both sides by x:\n\n5x= (x\u00b2)/2 +12y - (y\u00b2)/2 \u2192 multiply all terms by 2:\n\n10x =x\u00b2 +24y - y\u00b2 \u2192 rearranged:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x +24y - y\u00b2=0 \u2192 equation (A)\n\nCase 2: X=-5:\n\nSimilarly,\n\n-5x= (x\u00b2)/2 +12y - (y\u00b2)/2 \u2192 multiply by 2:\n\n-10x =x\u00b2 +24y - y\u00b2 \u2192 rearranged:\n\nx\u00b2 +24y - y\u00b2 +10x=0 \u2192 equation (B)\n\nNow, also from the angle AXB=90\u00b0: x\u00b2 -a x + y\u00b2=0 \u2192 equation (1).\n\nLet me focus on Case 1 first: X=5 (circumcenter at (5,12))\n\nEquation (A):\n\nx\u00b2 -10x +24y - y\u00b2=0 \u2192 but from equation (1): y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2 \u2192 substitute:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x +24y - (a x -x\u00b2 )=0 \u2192 x\u00b2 -10x +24y -a x +x\u00b2=0 \u2192 2x\u00b2 - (10+a)x +24y=0 \u2192 equation (A1).\n\nAlso, from equation (1): y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2 \u2192 y= sqrt(a x -x\u00b2). But messy.\n\nAlternatively, let me express y from equation (A):\n\nFrom equation (A):\n\nx\u00b2 -10x +24y - y\u00b2=0 \u2192 Rearranged:24y = -x\u00b2 +10x +y\u00b2 \u2192 but y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2 from equation (1):\n\n24y = -x\u00b2 +10x +a x -x\u00b2 \u2192 24y = -2x\u00b2 +x(a +10)\n\nThus,\n\ny= [ -2x\u00b2 +x(a +10) ] /24 \u2192 equation (A2).\n\nNow, substitute this expression for y into equation (1):\n\ny\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2 \u2192 [ (-2x\u00b2 +x(a+10))/24 ]\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2\n\nThis would lead to a quartic equation, but maybe manageable.\n\nLet me compute left side:\n\n[ x(-2x +a+10)/24 ]\u00b2 =x\u00b2 ( -2x +a+10 )\u00b2 / (24)^2\n\nSet equal to right side:\n\na x -x\u00b2 =x(a -x)\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 ( -2x +a+10 )\u00b2 / (24)^2 =x(a -x)\n\nDivide both sides by x (assuming x\u22600):\n\nx ( -2x +a+10 )\u00b2 / 576 =a -x \u2192 rearrange:\n\nx ( -2x +a+10 )\u00b2 =576(a -x )\n\nLet me denote t =x for simplicity.\n\nThus,\n\nt ( -2t +a+10 )\u00b2 =576(a -t )\n\nExpand the left side:\n\nLet me compute (-2t +a+10)^2 = (a+10 -2t)^2 = (a+10)^2 -4(a+10)t +4t\u00b2\n\nThus,\n\nLeft side= t[ (a+10)^2 -4(a+10)t +4t\u00b2 ] = (a+10)^2 t -4(a+10)t\u00b2 +4t\u00b3\n\nSet equal to right side:\n\n576a -576t\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n(a+10)^2 t -4(a+10)t\u00b2 +4t\u00b3 -576a +576t =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4t\u00b3 -4(a+10)t\u00b2 + [ (a+10)^2 +576 ]t -576a =0\n\nThis is a cubic equation in t (which is x). This seems very complex.\n\nPerhaps assume that a is such that this equation can be factored?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, consider that in case 1 where the circumcenter is (5,12), then the distance from (5,12) to X(x,y) must also be 13:\n\nsqrt( (x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2 )=13 \u2192 (x-5)^2 + (y-12)^2 =169 \u2192 equation (C).\n\nBut we also have equation (1):x\u00b2 -a x +y\u00b2=0.\n\nExpand equation (C):\n\nx\u00b2 -10x +25 + y\u00b2 -24y +144=169 \u2192 x\u00b2 +y\u00b2 -10x -24y +169=169 \u2192x\u00b2 +y\u00b2 -10x -24y=0\n\nFrom equation (1):x\u00b2 +y\u00b2 =a x \u2192 substitute:\n\na x -10x -24y=0 \u2192x(a-10)=24y \u2192 y= x(a-10)/24 \u2192 equation (D).\n\nSubstitute this into equation (C):\n\nx\u00b2 +y\u00b2 -10x -24y=0 \u2192 but from equation (1a), x\u00b2 +y\u00b2 =a x, so:\n\na x -10x -24y=0 \u2192 which is the same as equation (D). So equation (C) is redundant.\n\nThus, we need another equation. Which is equation (B) from the other triangle BXC.\n\nProceeding similarly for triangle BXC with circumradius 15.\n\nFollowing similar steps, the circumcenter of BXC is equidistant to B, X, C.\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of BC is the horizontal line y=12 (since BC is vertical from (a,0) to (a,24)).\n\nThe perpendicular bisector of BX:\n\nMidpoint of BX is ((a+x)/2, y/2). The slope of BX is (y -0)/(x -a)= y/(x-a), so the perpendicular bisector has slope -(x-a)/y.\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of BX is:\n\n(Y - y/2) = [ - (x -a)/y ] (X - (a+x)/2 )\n\nThis line intersects the perpendicular bisector of BC (y=12) at the circumcenter (h,12).\n\nSubstitute Y=12 into the equation:\n\n12 - y/2 = [ - (x -a)/y ] (X - (a+x)/2 )\n\nSolve for X:\n\nMultiply both sides by y:\n\ny*(12 - y/2) = - (x -a)(X - (a+x)/2 )\n\nExpand left side:\n\n12y - (y\u00b2)/2 = - (x -a)X + (x -a)(a+x)/2\n\nRearrange:\n\n(x -a)X = (x -a)(a+x)/2 +12y - (y\u00b2)/2\n\nThus,\n\nX = [ (x -a)(a+x)/2 +12y - (y\u00b2)/2 ] / (x -a )\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(x\u00b2 -a\u00b2)/2 +12y - y\u00b2/2\n\nDenominator: x -a\n\nThus,\n\nX = [ (x\u00b2 -a\u00b2 +24y - y\u00b2 )/2 ] / (x -a )\n\nBut from equation (1): y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2 \u2192 substitute:\n\nNumerator becomes:\n\n(x\u00b2 -a\u00b2) +24y - (a x -x\u00b2 ) all over 2 \u2192 (x\u00b2 -a\u00b2 +24y -a x +x\u00b2)/2 \u2192 (2x\u00b2 -a x -a\u00b2 +24y)/2\n\nThus,\n\nX= [2x\u00b2 -a x -a\u00b2 +24y]/[2(x -a)]\n\nThe distance from this circumcenter (X,12) to B(a,0) must be 15:\n\nsqrt( (X -a)^2 + (12 -0)^2 ) =15 \u2192 (X -a)^2 +144=225 \u2192 (X -a)^2=81 \u2192 X -a=\u00b19 \u2192 X= a\u00b19.\n\nThus, the x-coordinate of the circumcenter is a+9 or a-9.\n\nThus, two cases:\n\nCase 1: X= a+9\n\nThus,\n\n[X= a+9 = [2x\u00b2 -a x -a\u00b2 +24y]/[2(x -a) ]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2(x -a):\n\n2(a+9)(x -a) =2x\u00b2 -a x -a\u00b2 +24y \u2192 expand left side:\n\n2(a+9)x -2(a+9)a =2x\u00b2 -a x -a\u00b2 +24y \u2192 2(a+9)x -2a(a+9)=2x\u00b2 -a x -a\u00b2 +24y\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2(a+9)x -2a(a+9) -2x\u00b2 +a x +a\u00b2 -24y=0 \u2192 -2x\u00b2 + [2(a+9)+a]x + (-2a(a+9) +a\u00b2) -24y=0\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nCoefficient of x: 2a +18 +a =3a +18\n\nConstants: -2a\u00b2 -18a +a\u00b2 = -a\u00b2 -18a\n\nThus,\n\n-2x\u00b2 + (3a+18)x -a\u00b2 -18a -24y=0 \u2192 multiply by -1:\n\n2x\u00b2 - (3a+18)x +a\u00b2 +18a +24y=0 \u2192 equation (E1).\n\nCase 2: X= a-9, similarly leads to another equation.\n\nThis is getting too involved. Perhaps there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, notice that in case of the circumcenters being (5,12) and (a+9,12), the horizontal distance between them is (a+9) -5 =a+4. The vertical distance is zero. The line connecting them is horizontal.\n\nAlternatively, since both circumcenters are at y=12, which is the midpoint of AD and BC, perhaps there is symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that a=25, even if it's approximate.\n\nIf a=25,\n\nFor case1:\n\nFrom equation (A): x\u00b2 -10x +24y - y\u00b2=0 and equation (1): y\u00b2=25x -x\u00b2.\n\nSubstitute y\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x +24y - (25x -x\u00b2)=0 \u21922x\u00b2 -35x +24y=0 \u219224y= -2x\u00b2+35x \u2192 y= (-2x\u00b2 +35x)/24.\n\nPlug into equation (1):\n\ny\u00b2=25x -x\u00b2 \u2192 [ (-2x\u00b2 +35x)/24 ]^2=25x -x\u00b2.\n\nThis equation might be solvable for x.\n\nLet me compute left side:\n\n(4x\u2074 -140x\u00b3 +1225x\u00b2)/576 =25x -x\u00b2 \u2192 multiply both sides by 576:\n\n4x\u2074 -140x\u00b3 +1225x\u00b2 =14400x -576x\u00b2 \u21924x\u2074 -140x\u00b3 + (1225+576)x\u00b2 -14400x=0 \u21924x\u2074 -140x\u00b3 +1801x\u00b2 -14400x=0 \u2192x(4x\u00b3 -140x\u00b2 +1801x -14400)=0.\n\nAssuming x\u22600:\n\n4x\u00b3 -140x\u00b2 +1801x -14400=0.\n\nTry possible rational roots.

Perhaps a=25 isn't the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 26, but the equations don't support it.\n\nWait, the problem states that both triangles are acute. So in the case when a\u224823.78, the triangle BXC with circumradius 15:\n\nThe side BC is 24, so the angle opposite BC is acute, so the angle at X must be <90\u00b0, so sin(angle X) = BC/(2R)=24/(2*15)=0.8, so angle X is arcsin(0.8)\u224853.13\u00b0, which is acute. So that's okay.\n\nSimilarly for AXD: sin(angle X)=12/13\u22480.923, angle\u224867.38\u00b0, acute.\n\nThus, the approximate value of a\u224823.78 is acceptable, but the problem likely expects an exact value.\n\nWait sqrt(3088)=sqrt(16\u00d7193)=4\u221a193, so the solution is a=( -8 +4\u221a193)/2= -4 +2\u221a193.\n\nBut 2\u221a193 is about 27.78, so total a\u224823.78, but this is irrational. Perhaps the problem is designed so that the quadratic factors?\n\nWait equation a\u00b2 +8a -756=0 \u2192 discriminant 3088= 16\u00d7193. Hmm, 193 is a prime number, so it's irrational.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a different approach.\n\nLet me consider the following:\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of X as (x,y).\n\nFrom angle AXB=90\u00b0, X lies on the circle with diameter AB: equation x\u00b2 -a x + y\u00b2=0.\n\nThe circumradius of AXD is 13. The circumradius formula for a triangle with coordinates can be connected to the sides.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for circumradius in terms of sides:\n\nFor triangle AXD:\n\nSides are AX, XD, AD.\n\nAD=24, AX=\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), XD=\u221a(x\u00b2 + (24\u2212y)\u00b2).\n\nCircumradius R= (AX * XD * AD)/(4\u0394)\n\n\u0394 is area =12x.\n\nThus,\n\n13= (AX * XD *24)/(48x) \u2192 AX * XD= (13\u00d748x)/(24)=26x.\n\nThus, AX * XD=26x.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\nR=15= (BX * XC *24)/(48(a\u2212x)) \u2192 BX * XC= (15\u00d748(a\u2212x))/24=30(a\u2212x).\n\nThus, BX * XC=30(a\u2212x).\n\nNow, AX * XD =26x and BX * XC=30(a\u2212x).\n\nAdditionally, from equation (1): AX\u00b2 =a x \u2212x\u00b2 + y\u00b2? Wait AX squared is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, and from equation (1a): AX\u00b2 =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x.\n\nThus, AX=\u221a(a x).\n\nSimilarly, XD\u00b2 =x\u00b2 + (24\u2212y)\u00b2.\n\nThus, AX * XD = sqrt(a x) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)\u00b2 )\n\nSet equal to 26x:\n\nsqrt(a x) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =26x \u2192 square both sides:\n\na x (x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )=676x\u00b2 \u2192 a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )=676x.\n\nThis is the same equation as before.\n\nSimilarly, for BX * XC=30(a\u2212x):\n\nBX=\u221a( (a\u2212x)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC=\u221a( (a\u2212x)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2 )\n\nProduct is sqrt( (a\u2212x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a\u2212x)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2 ) =30(a\u2212x)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[ (a\u2212x)^2 + y\u00b2 ][ (a\u2212x)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2 ] =900(a\u2212x)^2.\n\nAgain, the same equation.\n\nThus, equations are consistent.\n\nNow, perhaps consider the following substitution:\n\nLet me denote s =x/a, so x =a s, where 0 <s <1.\n\nSimilarly, let me let y =24 t, since y is between 0 and24.\n\nThus, y=24 t, 0 <t <1.\n\nNow, equation (1): x\u00b2 -a x + y\u00b2=0 \u2192 (a s)^2 -a(a s)+ (24t)^2=0 \u2192a\u00b2s\u00b2 -a\u00b2 s +576t\u00b2=0 \u2192 divide by a\u00b2:\n\ns\u00b2 -s + (576/a\u00b2 )t\u00b2=0 \u2192 equation (1s).\n\nEquation AX * XD=26x:\n\nAX=\u221a(a x)=\u221a(a^2 s)=a\u221as.\n\nXD=\u221a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )=\u221a(a\u00b2 s\u00b2 + (24 -24 t)^2 )=\u221a(a\u00b2 s\u00b2 +24\u00b2(1 -t)^2 )\n\nThus,\n\nAX * XD =a\u221as * sqrt(a\u00b2 s\u00b2 +576(1 -t)^2 ) =26a s.\n\nDivide both sides by a:\n\n\u221as * sqrt(a\u00b2 s\u00b2 +576(1 -t)^2 ) =26 s.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\ns(a\u00b2 s\u00b2 +576(1 -t)^2 )=676 s\u00b2 \u2192 a\u00b2 s\u00b2 +576(1 -t)^2 =676 s \u2192 equation (2s).\n\nSimilarly, for the other equation:\n\nBX * XC=30(a\u2212x)=30a(1\u2212s)\n\nBX=\u221a( (a\u2212x)^2 + y\u00b2 )=\u221a(a\u00b2(1-s)^2 + (24t)^2 )=\u221a(a\u00b2(1-s)^2 +576 t\u00b2 )\n\nXC=\u221a( (a-x)^2 + (24 -y)^2 )=\u221a(a\u00b2(1-s)^2 + (24 -24t)^2 )=\u221a(a\u00b2(1-s)^2 +576(1-t)^2 )\n\nThus,\n\nBX * XC =\u221a[a\u00b2(1-s)^2 +576 t\u00b2 ] * \u221a[a\u00b2(1-s)^2 +576(1-t)^2 ] =30a(1-s)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n[ a\u00b2(1-s)^2 +576 t\u00b2 ][ a\u00b2(1-s)^2 +576(1-t)^2 ] =900a\u00b2(1-s)^2 \u2192 equation (3s).\n\nNow, we have equations (1s), (2s), (3s) in terms of s, t, a. This might be more manageable.\n\nFrom equation (1s):\n\ns\u00b2 -s + (576/a\u00b2 )t\u00b2=0 \u2192 (576/a\u00b2 )t\u00b2 =s -s\u00b2 \u2192 t\u00b2= (a\u00b2/s)(s -s\u00b2) \u2192 t\u00b2= a\u00b2 (1 -s)/s \u2192 equation (1t).\n\nSubstitute t\u00b2 from equation (1t) into equation (2s):\n\na\u00b2 s\u00b2 +576(1 -t)^2 =676 s.\n\nExpand (1-t)^2=1-2t +t\u00b2:\n\n= a\u00b2 s\u00b2 +576(1 -2t +t\u00b2 ) =676 s \u2192 a\u00b2 s\u00b2 +576 -1152 t +576t\u00b2 =676 s.\n\nSubstitute t\u00b2 from (1t):\n\n576t\u00b2=576*(a\u00b2/s)(1 -s)/s \u2192576t\u00b2=576a\u00b2 (1 -s)/s\u00b2 \u2192 so,\n\na\u00b2 s\u00b2 +576 -1152 t +576a\u00b2 (1 -s)/s\u00b2 =676 s \u2192 equation (2t).\n\nThis is still complex.\n\nLet me see if we can express t in terms of s from equation (1t).\n\nFrom (1t):\n\nt\u00b2= a\u00b2 (1 -s)/s \u2192 t= a sqrt( (1-s)/s ). Since t is between0 and1, the square root is real, so (1-s)/s \u22650 \u2192 0 <s \u22641. Which it is.\n\nLet me denote sqrt( (1-s)/s ) =k \u2192 (1-s)/s =k\u00b2 \u21921 -s =s k\u00b2 \u21921= s(k\u00b2+1) \u2192 s=1/(k\u00b2+1). Thus, k= sqrt( (1-s)/s ).\n\nThus, t= a k.\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that a=24/sqrt(2), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the equations might require a particular relation between s and a.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that the problem is designed with a=25, even if equations don't exactly fit, but perhaps the problem has a different approach.\n\nWait, another approach: since both triangles AXD and BXC have known circumradii and one side equal to 24, perhaps using the formula for the circumradius in terms of sides and angles.\n\nFor triangle AXD:\n\nAD=24 is a side opposite to angle at X. So R=13= AD/(2 sin\u03b8), where \u03b8 is the angle at X. So sin\u03b8=24/(2\u00d713)=12/13 \u2192 \u03b8=arcsin(12/13).\n\nSimilarly for BXC: R=15= BC/(2 sin\u03c6) \u2192 sin\u03c6=24/(2\u00d715)=4/5 \u2192 \u03c6=arcsin(4/5).\n\nNow, in the rectangle, the coordinates of X must satisfy the angle AXB=90\u00b0, and the angles at X in triangles AXD and BXC are known.\n\nPerhaps we can use trigonometric identities.\n\nLet me consider triangle AXD. The angle at X is \u03b8=arcsin(12/13). The sides adjacent to this angle are AX and XD.\n\nSimilarly, the angle at X in BXC is \u03c6=arcsin(4/5).\n\nPerhaps using the Law of Sines in both triangles.\n\nFor triangle AXD:\n\nAX/sin(angle at D) =2\u00d7R=26.\n\nSimilarly, angle at D is opposite to AX, which is opposite angle at X (\u03b8).\n\nWait, Law of Sines:\n\nAX/sin(angle at D)= XD/sin(angle at A)= AD/sin\u03b8.\n\nWait angle at A is angle between AD and AX. Since A is (0,0), AD is vertical, AX is to point (x,y). So angle at A is between AD (vertical) and AX (to X). The angle at D is between AD (vertical downward) and DX.\n\nThis might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle AXD:\n\nsin\u03b8=12/13= opposite over hypotenuse in some context? No, R is related.\n\nAlternatively, using Law of Sines:\n\nIn triangle AXD:\n\nAX/sin(angle at D) = XD/sin(angle at A) = AD/sin\u03b8 =24/sin\u03b8=24/(12/13)=26.\n\nThus,\n\nAX=26 sin(angle at D )\n\nXD=26 sin(angle at A )\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC:\n\nBX/sin(angle at C)= XC/sin(angle at B)= BC/sin\u03c6=24/(4/5)=30.\n\nThus,\n\nBX=30 sin(angle at C )\n\nXC=30 sin(angle at B )\n\nBut I'm not sure how to proceed with this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider coordinates based on angles.\n\nSince angle AXB=90\u00b0, the coordinates of X must satisfy that AX and BX are perpendicular.\n\nLet me try to parametrize X such that:\n\nLet me set AB =a, coordinates as before.\n\nLet me set X such that vector AX is (x,y), vector BX is (x\u2212a,y).\n\nTheir dot product is x(x\u2212a)+y\u00b2=0 \u2192 equation (1).\n\nAlso, in triangle AXD, angle at X has sine 12/13.\n\nThe angle at X is between sides XA and XD.\n\nVector XA is (-x, -y).\n\nVector XD is (-x, 24\u2212y).\n\nThe sine of the angle between them is 12/13.\n\nThe sine of the angle between vectors u and v is |u \u00d7 v|/(|u||v|).\n\nThus,\n\n| (-x)(24 -y) - (-y)(-x) | / ( |XA| |XD| )= 12/13.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n|x(24 -y) - yx|=|24x -xy -xy|=|24x -2xy|=2x|12 -y|.\n\nDenominator:\n\n|XA|=sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2), |XD|=sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24\u2212y)^2).\n\nThus,\n\n2x|12 -y| / ( sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24\u2212y)^2 ) ) =12/13.\n\nMultiply both sides by denominators and divide by 2x:\n\n|12 -y| / ( sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24\u2212y)^2 ) / (2x) ) =6/13.\n\nBut from equation AX * XD =26x (from earlier):\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)*sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24\u2212y)^2 )=26x.\n\nThus,\n\n|12 -y| / (26x/(2x) )= |12 -y|/13 =6/13 \u2192 |12\u2212y|=6 \u2192 y=6 or y=18.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\nThe angle at X has sine 4/5.\n\nVectors XB=(x\u2212a,y), XC=(x\u2212a,24\u2212y).\n\nThe angle between XB and XC is angle at X.\n\nThe sine of this angle is 4/5.\n\nUsing cross product:\n\n| (x\u2212a)(24\u2212y) - y(x\u2212a) | / ( |XB| |XC| )=4/5.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n|(x-a)(24 -y -y)|=|(x-a)(24-2y)|.\n\nDenominator:\n\n|XB| sqrt( (x-a)^2 + y\u00b2 ), |XC|=sqrt( (x-a)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2 )\n\nThus,\n\n|(x-a)(24-2y)| / ( sqrt( (x-a)^2 + y\u00b2 ) sqrt( (x-a)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2 ) )=4/5.\n\nBut from earlier, BX * XC=30(a\u2212x):\n\nsqrt( (x-a)^2 + y\u00b2 ) sqrt( (x-a)^2 + (24\u2212y)^2 )=30(a\u2212x).\n\nThus,\n\n| (x-a)(24-2y) | / (30(a\u2212x) )=4/5 \u2192 |24-2y|/30=4/5 \u2192 |24-2y|=24 \u219224-2y=\u00b124.\n\nCase1:24-2y=24\u2192 y=0. But y=0 would put X on AB, but inside the rectangle, but angle AXB would be 180\u00b0, not 90\u00b0, so invalid.\n\nCase2:24-2y=-24\u21922y=48\u2192y=24. But y=24 would put X on AD or DC, but then angle AXB would be 90\u00b0 only if X is at D, which is a vertex, but X is inside, so invalid.\n\nThus, contradiction. This suggests an error.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the cross product calculation.\n\nLet me recalculate the cross product for the angle at X in BXC.\n\nVectors XB and XC:\n\nXB vector is from X to B: (a -x, -y)\n\nXC vector is from X to C: (a -x, 24 - y)\n\nThe cross product magnitude is |(a -x)(24 - y) - (-y)(a -x)| = |(a -x)(24 - y + y)| = |(a -x)*24| =24(a -x).\n\nWait, that's different.\n\nWait, the cross product of vectors (a-x, -y) and (a-x,24\u2212y) is:\n\ni component: (a -x)(24 - y) - (-y)(a -x) = (a-x)(24 -y + y)=24(a\u2212x)\n\nSo the magnitude is 24(a\u2212x).\n\nThus, the sine of the angle is |24(a\u2212x)| / ( |XB||XC| )\n\nSet equal to 4/5:\n\n24(a\u2212x)/ ( |XB||XC| )=4/5 \u2192 but |XB||XC|=30(a\u2212x), so substitute:\n\n24(a\u2212x)/ (30(a\u2212x) )=24/30=4/5. \n\nThus, this holds for any a and x. So the condition is automatically satisfied. Thus, no additional constraint.\n\nTherefore, only the condition from the first triangle gives us y=6 or y=18.\n\nThus, possible y=6 or y=18.\n\nLet me consider y=6 first.\n\nCase1: y=6.\n\nFrom equation (1):x\u00b2 -a x +6\u00b2=0 \u2192x\u00b2 -a x +36=0 \u2192x\u00b2 =a x -36.\n\nAlso, from the earlier result AX * XD=26x.\n\nAX=\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=\u221a(x\u00b2+36).\n\nXD=\u221a(x\u00b2 + (24-6)^2)=\u221a(x\u00b2 + 324).\n\nTheir product is \u221a(x\u00b2+36) *\u221a(x\u00b2+324)=26x.\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(x\u00b2+36)(x\u00b2+324)=676x\u00b2.\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx^4 +324x\u00b2 +36x\u00b2 +36*324 =x^4 +360x\u00b2 +11664.\n\nSet equal to 676x\u00b2:\n\nx^4 +360x\u00b2 +11664 =676x\u00b2 \u2192x^4 -316x\u00b2 +11664=0.\n\nLet me set z=x\u00b2:\n\nz\u00b2 -316z +11664=0 \u2192 quadratic equation:\n\nz=(316\u00b1\u221a(316\u00b2 -4*1*11664))/2.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n316\u00b2= (300+16)^2=90000+9600+256=100,856.\n\n4*11664=46,656.\n\nThus discriminant=100,856 -46,656=54,200.\n\n\u221a54,200=232.8 approximately.\n\nThus,\n\nz=(316\u00b1232.8)/2.\n\nCompute both roots:\n\n(316+232.8)/2\u2248548.8/2\u2248274.4,\n\n(316-232.8)/2\u224883.2/2\u224841.6.\n\nThus, x\u00b2=274.4 or 41.6.\n\nSince x\u00b2 must also satisfy x\u00b2 =a x -36 \u2192 a x= x\u00b2+36.\n\nThus, for x\u00b2=274.4 \u2192a x=274.4+36=310.4 \u2192a=310.4/x.\n\nAlso, x=\u00b1\u221a274.4\u2248\u00b116.56.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So we have a rectangle ABCD with BC = 24. Point X is inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, and their circumradii are 13 and 15 respectively. We need to find the length of AB. Hmm, this seems a bit involved, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let me sketch the rectangle mentally. Let me consider the rectangle ABCD with AB and CD as the lengths, and BC and AD as the widths. Since BC is given as 24, that means the height of the rectangle is 24. So the rectangle has sides AB (which we need to find) and BC = 24. Let me note that in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB = CD and BC = AD.\n\nNow, point X is inside the rectangle, and angle AXB is 90 degrees. That means triangle AXB is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at X. Since X is inside the rectangle, this gives some constraints on where X can be placed.\n\nAlso, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. That means all their angles are less than 90 degrees. The circumradii of these triangles are given as 13 and 15 respectively. Remember that the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is given by the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area). Alternatively, since in a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse, but these triangles AXD and BXC are not necessarily right-angled, except maybe AXB is. Wait, AXB is right-angled at X, but AXD and BXC are acute. So their circumradii are given, which might help us find their sides.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the rectangle to make it easier. Let's set coordinate system with point A at (0,0), so then B would be (AB, 0), C is (AB, 24), and D is (0,24). Let me denote AB as the variable we need to find, let's call it x. So AB = x, so coordinates:\n\nA: (0,0)\nB: (x,0)\nC: (x,24)\nD: (0,24)\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, so its coordinates can be represented as (h, k) where 0 < h < x and 0 < k <24.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so vectors AX and BX are perpendicular. Let me write vectors:\n\nVector AX is from A to X: (h, k)\nVector BX is from B to X: (h - x, k)\n\nTheir dot product should be zero:\n\nh*(h - x) + k*k = 0\n=> h\u00b2 - h x + k\u00b2 = 0.  Equation (1)\n\nNow, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. Let me recall that in a triangle, if all angles are acute, then for any side, the square of each side is less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So for triangle AXD, which has vertices at A(0,0), X(h,k), D(0,24), so sides:\n\nAX: length sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2)\nXD: sqrt( (h - 0)^2 + (24 - k)^2 ) = sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\nAD: which is 24, but actually AD is a side of the rectangle, but in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, no. Wait, triangle AXD has vertices A, X, D. So sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait no, AD is a side of the rectangle but not part of the triangle. Wait, the sides of triangle AXD are AX, XD, and AD? Wait no. Wait, points A, X, D: the sides are between A and X, X and D, and A and D. Wait, A to D is a side of the rectangle, yes. So triangle AXD has sides AX, XD, and AD (24). Similarly, triangle BXC has sides BX, XC, and BC (24). Wait, but BC is 24, so that's fixed.\n\nBut the problem states that both triangles AXD and BXC are acute. So all their angles are less than 90 degrees. Hmm, so for triangle AXD, all the sides must satisfy the triangle inequalities for being acute. Similarly for BXC.\n\nBut maybe first, let's focus on the circumradius part. The circumradius of triangle AXD is 13, and that of BXC is 15. Let me recall the formula for the circumradius R of a triangle with sides a, b, c is R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area). Alternatively, if the triangle is right-angled, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. But since these triangles are acute, they are not right-angled, so we need to use the general formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates to find their sides and then compute the circumradius. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, let me note the coordinates again:\n\nA(0,0), B(x,0), C(x,24), D(0,24), X(h,k).\n\nFirst, let's compute the sides of triangle AXD.\n\nAX: distance from A to X is sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2).\n\nXD: distance from X to D is sqrt( (0 - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2 ) = sqrt( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nAD: distance from A to D is 24. Since AD is a side of the rectangle.\n\nWait, triangle AXD has sides AX, XD, and AD. Wait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, but in the triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, but AD is a straight side from A(0,0) to D(0,24), so that's one side, and then the other sides are AX and XD. So yes, the three sides are AX, XD, and AD (24). So to compute the circumradius of triangle AXD, which is given as 13, we can use the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area).\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, which has vertices B(x,0), X(h,k), and C(x,24). The sides here are BX, XC, and BC (24). The circumradius for this triangle is 15.\n\nSo let me first write expressions for the circumradius for both triangles.\n\nStarting with triangle AXD:\n\nLet me denote the sides as follows:\n\nLet a = AX = sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2)\n\nb = XD = sqrt( h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 )\n\nc = AD = 24\n\nThe area of triangle AXD can be calculated using coordinates. Since it's a triangle with points A(0,0), X(h,k), D(0,24). Using the shoelace formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)| (0*(k - 24) + h*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - k) ) | = (1/2)| 0 + 24h + 0 | = (1/2)(24h) = 12h.\n\nAlternatively, since the base AD is 24, and the height would be the horizontal distance from X to AD, which is along the y-axis. Since AD is vertical from (0,0) to (0,24), the horizontal distance from X(h,k) to AD is h. So area is (base * height)/2 = (24 * h)/2 = 12h. That's correct.\n\nTherefore, the area is 12h.\n\nThen, the circumradius R1 for triangle AXD is (a*b*c)/(4*Area) = [sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 ) * 24 ] / (4 * 12h )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4 * 12h = 48h\n\nNumerator: 24 * sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nSo R1 = [24 * sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) ] / (48h )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 24/48 = 1/2, so:\n\nR1 = [ sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) ] / (2h )\n\nGiven that R1 is 13, so:\n\nsqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) / (2h ) = 13\n\nMultiply both sides by 2h:\n\nsqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) = 26h  Equation (2)\n\nSimilarly, let's compute the circumradius for triangle BXC.\n\nTriangle BXC has vertices B(x,0), X(h,k), C(x,24). Let's denote the sides:\n\nBX: distance from B to X is sqrt( (h -x)^2 + k^2 )\n\nXC: distance from X to C is sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nBC: 24 (since BC is the side of the rectangle)\n\nArea of triangle BXC: Let's compute using coordinates. Points B(x,0), X(h,k), C(x,24). Using shoelace formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)| x*(k -24) + h*(24 -0) + x*(0 -k) |\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/2)| x(k -24) + 24h + x(-k) |\n\n= (1/2)| xk -24x +24h -xk |\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nThe xk terms cancel: xk -xk =0, so we have:\n\n= (1/2)| -24x +24h | = (1/2)*24 | -x + h | = 12 | h -x | \n\nSince h is between 0 and x, h - x is negative, so absolute value is x - h. Thus area is 12(x - h).\n\nTherefore, the area is 12(x - h).\n\nThe sides are:\n\nBX = sqrt( (x - h)^2 + k^2 )\n\nXC = sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nBC =24\n\nThus, the circumradius R2 for triangle BXC is (BX * XC * BC )/(4*Area )\n\nPlugging in:\n\nR2 = [ sqrt( (x -h)^2 +k^2 ) * sqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) *24 ] / (4*12(x - h) )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12(x - h) = 48(x - h)\n\nNumerator: 24 * sqrt(...) * sqrt(...)\n\nSo R2 = [24 * sqrt( (x -h)^2 +k^2 ) * sqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) ] / [48(x - h) ]\n\nSimplify fractions: 24/48 = 1/2\n\nThus,\n\nR2 = [ sqrt( (x -h)^2 +k^2 ) * sqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) ] / [ 2(x - h) ]\n\nGiven that R2 =15, so:\n\nsqrt( (x -h)^2 +k^2 ) * sqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) / [ 2(x - h) ] =15\n\nMultiply both sides by 2(x - h):\n\nsqrt( (x -h)^2 +k^2 ) * sqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) = 30(x - h)  Equation (3)\n\nNow, so we have equations (2) and (3). Also, we have equation (1):\n\nh\u00b2 - h x + k\u00b2 =0. Let me note equation (1):\n\nh\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h x. Equation (1)\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use equation (1) to substitute into equations (2) and (3). Let me see.\n\nFirst, let me note that equation (1): h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = h x. Let me see if I can express h x as h\u00b2 + k\u00b2. Maybe this can help simplify equations (2) and (3).\n\nLooking at equation (2):\n\nsqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =26h\n\nLet me compute the terms inside the square roots:\n\nFirst sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) is straightforward, since from equation (1), h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x, so sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)= sqrt(h x).\n\nSecond term: sqrt( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nLet me expand (24 -k)^2 = 24\u00b2 -48k +k\u00b2, so h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 -48k = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) + 24\u00b2 -48k. From equation (1), h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x, so substituting:\n\n= h x + 576 -48k. So the second sqrt becomes sqrt( h x +576 -48k )\n\nThus equation (2) becomes:\n\nsqrt( h x ) * sqrt( h x +576 -48k ) =26 h\n\nLet me denote sqrt(a) * sqrt(b) = sqrt(a*b), so:\n\nsqrt [ h x * (h x +576 -48k ) ] =26 h\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nh x * (h x +576 -48k ) = (26 h)^2 = 676 h\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by h (assuming h \u22600, which it is since X is inside the rectangle):\n\nx*(h x + 576 -48k ) =676 h\n\nExpand the left side:\n\nx\u00b2 h + 576 x -48 x k =676 h\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated, but let's hold onto this for a moment. Let me see if equation (3) can be expressed similarly.\n\nEquation (3):\n\nsqrt( (x -h)^2 +k^2 ) * sqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =30(x - h)\n\nAgain, let me denote terms inside sqrt:\n\nFirst sqrt: sqrt( (x -h)^2 +k^2 )\n\nSecond sqrt: sqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nLet me compute (x-h)^2 +k^2:\n\n= x\u00b2 -2xh +h\u00b2 +k\u00b2. From equation (1), h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x, so substituting:\n\n= x\u00b2 -2xh + h x =x\u00b2 -xh\n\nSimilarly, (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2:\n\n= (x-h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 = (x\u00b2 -2xh +h\u00b2) + (576 -48k +k\u00b2 )\n\nAgain, h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x, so substitute:\n\n= x\u00b2 -2xh + h x + 576 -48k\n\n= x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k\n\nSo the second sqrt becomes sqrt( x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k )\n\nTherefore, equation (3):\n\nsqrt( x\u00b2 -xh ) * sqrt( x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k ) =30(x - h)\n\nAgain, sqrt(a)*sqrt(b) = sqrt(ab):\n\nsqrt[ (x\u00b2 -xh)(x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k) ] =30(x - h)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n(x\u00b2 -xh)(x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k ) =900(x - h)^2\n\nLet me denote that term (x\u00b2 -xh) as let's say, let me see if there is a substitution here. Let me note that (x\u00b2 -xh) is equal to x(x - h). Hmm, maybe that can help. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote y = x - h. Since h is between 0 and x, y is positive. Let me see if this substitution helps. Let me define y = x - h, so that h = x - y. Also, let me denote z = k. Then perhaps the equations can be expressed in terms of y and z.\n\nBut before that, let me see if there's another relation. Let's look back at equation (1): h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x. Let me write h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2, so x = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)/h.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express variables in terms of y and z.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that in equation (1), h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x, so h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2. Let me think of this as x = h + (k\u00b2)/h. Hmm, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, let me see equations (2) and (3). Let me see equation (2):\n\nAfter substitution, we had:\n\nx*(h x +576 -48k ) =676 h   Equation (2a)\n\nAnd equation (3) after expansion:\n\n(x\u00b2 -xh)(x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k ) =900(x - h)^2 Equation (3a)\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a common term here. Let me denote term T = x\u00b2 -xh. Then equation (3a) becomes T*(T +576 -48k ) =900(x -h)^2\n\nBut in equation (2a), perhaps T can be related? Let's see.\n\nWait, in equation (1): h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x. Let me see, T =x\u00b2 -xh =x(x - h). Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, let's see:\n\nWait, equation (1):\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x => h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2. So h x - h\u00b2 =k\u00b2 => h (x - h)=k\u00b2. Let me denote that as equation (1a):\n\nh (x -h ) =k\u00b2. Equation (1a)\n\nAh, this is a useful relation. So k squared is h times (x - h). Let me note that.\n\nSo, from equation (1a), k\u00b2 = h(x - h). So k = sqrt( h(x - h) ). Since k is positive as it's a coordinate inside the rectangle. So that's an important relation.\n\nSo, k squared is h(x - h). Let's see if we can substitute this into equations (2a) and (3a).\n\nFirst, let me try equation (2a):\n\nx*(h x +576 -48k ) =676 h\n\nLet me express h x as h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 from equation (1). So h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2. So substituting into equation (2a):\n\nx*( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 ) +576 -48k ) =676 h\n\nBut h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2, so h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x, so substituting again:\n\nx*( h x +576 -48k ) =676 h\n\nWait, that's the same as before. Hmm, perhaps instead of substituting h x, let me use the relation k\u00b2 = h(x - h). Let me see.\n\nLet me express terms in equation (2a):\n\nLet me write h x +576 -48k = h x +576 -48k. But h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2, so:\n\n= h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k\n\nSo substituting into equation (2a):\n\nx*( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k ) =676 h\n\nHmm. Let me see, h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 is h x, so:\n\n= x*( h x + 576 -48k ) =676 h\n\nWait, that's the same as original. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express in terms of k\u00b2.\n\nSince k\u00b2 = h(x - h), so h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h\u00b2 + h(x - h) = h\u00b2 + h x -h\u00b2 = h x. Hmm, that just brings us back. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to plug in k\u00b2 = h(x - h) into equations (2a) and (3a).\n\nLet me see equation (2a):\n\nx*(h x +576 -48k ) =676 h\n\nExpress h x as h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 from equation (1). So:\n\nx*(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k ) =676 h\n\nBut h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x, so:\n\nx*( h x +576 -48k ) =676 h. Still same.\n\nAlternatively, let me write h x +576 -48k = h x + 576 -48k. Let me see if I can express 48k in terms of h and x.\n\nFrom equation (1a): k = sqrt( h(x - h) ). But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of variables. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider equations (2a) and (3a) as two equations with variables x, h, k, but with another relation from equation (1a). So three equations with three variables (since x is the AB which we need to find, and h and k are coordinates of X). So perhaps we can solve them.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if we can find a relationship between equations (2a) and (3a). Let me note:\n\nEquation (2a): x*(h x +576 -48k ) =676 h\n\nEquation (3a): (x\u00b2 -xh)(x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k ) =900(x - h)^2\n\nLet me denote T = x\u00b2 -xh, which is equal to x(x -h). Also, let me note that 576 -48k is a term appearing in both equations.\n\nFrom equation (1a): k\u00b2 = h(x -h). Let me denote that as k = sqrt( h(x -h) ). Hmm, but maybe not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let\u2019s see if we can write equation (2a) as:\n\nx*(T + 576 -48k + h x - (x\u00b2 -xh )) ?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me see:\n\nWait, in equation (2a), the term inside the bracket is h x +576 -48k. Let me note that h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2, so substituting:\n\n= h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k. Hmm, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me look for substitutions. Let me see if we can express variables in terms of (x - h) and h.\n\nLet me set variable substitution: Let me let\u2019s denote a = h, and b = x - h. Then, since h + b = x, and k\u00b2 = a*b from equation (1a): k\u00b2 = h(x - h) = a*b. So k = sqrt(ab).\n\nSo substituting into equations (2a) and (3a):\n\nFirst, let me re-express everything in terms of a and b.\n\nLet me set a = h, so b = x - h, so x = a + b, and k = sqrt(ab).\n\nEquation (2a):\n\nOriginal equation (2a):\n\nx*(h x +576 -48k ) =676 h\n\nExpress h x = h*(a + b ) = a(a + b )\n\nWait, h is a, so h x = a*(a + b )\n\nSo substituting into equation (2a):\n\nx*( a(a + b) +576 -48k ) =676 a\n\nBut x = a + b, so:\n\n(a + b)*[ a(a + b) +576 -48k ] =676 a\n\nSimilarly, equation (3a):\n\nOriginal equation (3a):\n\n(x\u00b2 -xh)(x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k ) =900(x - h)^2\n\nFirst, x\u00b2 -xh = (a + b)^2 -a(a + b) = (a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2) -a\u00b2 -ab = ab + b\u00b2 = b(a + b )\n\nWait, let me compute x\u00b2 -xh step by step.\n\nx\u00b2 = (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab +b\u00b2\n\nxh = (a + b)*a =a\u00b2 +ab\n\nThus, x\u00b2 -xh = (a\u00b2 +2ab +b\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 +ab) = ab +b\u00b2 = b(a +b )\n\nTherefore, the first term in equation (3a) is b(a +b )\n\nThe second term in the first factor is (x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k ) = b(a +b ) +576 -48k\n\nTherefore, equation (3a):\n\n[ b(a + b ) ] * [ b(a +b ) +576 -48k ] =900*(x -h )\u00b2\n\nBut x -h = b, so RHS is 900*b\u00b2\n\nThus equation (3a) becomes:\n\nb(a +b ) * [ b(a +b ) +576 -48k ] =900b\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by b (assuming b \u22600, which it is since x > h):\n\n(a +b ) * [ b(a +b ) +576 -48k ] =900b\n\nSo now, equations (2a) and (3a) in terms of a and b (with k = sqrt(ab)):\n\nEquation (2a):\n\n(a + b)*[ a(a + b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab) ] =676 a\n\nEquation (3a):\n\n(a +b ) * [ b(a +b ) +576 -48 sqrt(ab) ] =900b\n\nHmm, so now we have two equations with variables a and b, with k expressed as sqrt(ab). Let me see if we can relate these equations.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b, and P = ab. Then k = sqrt(P). Let me see if that substitution helps.\n\nLet me try that substitution:\n\nLet S = a + b,\n\nP = a b,\n\nso then sqrt(P) = sqrt(ab) =k.\n\nSo equation (2a):\n\nS * [ a S +576 -48 sqrt(P) ] =676 a\n\nBut a = S - b, but perhaps not helpful. Alternatively, note that a S = a(a + b) =a\u00b2 +ab =a\u00b2 + P.\n\nSimilarly, equation (2a):\n\nS*( a\u00b2 + P +576 -48 sqrt(P) ) =676a\n\nBut since P =a b, and S =a +b, perhaps this is not straightforward. Let me see equation (3a):\n\nEquation (3a):\n\nS * [ b S +576 -48 sqrt(P) ] =900 b\n\nSimilarly, b S = b(a +b)=ab +b\u00b2 = P +b\u00b2\n\nHmm, this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps subtract or relate the two equations.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote equation (2a):\n\nLet me denote equation (2a) as:\n\nLeft side: (a +b)[a(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab)] =676a\n\nEquation (3a):\n\nLeft side: (a +b)[ b(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab) ] =900b\n\nLet me factor out (a +b) from both equations. Let me see if I can write both equations as:\n\nEquation (2a):\n\n(a +b)[ a(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab) ] =676a --> Equation (2a)\n\nEquation (3a):\n\n(a +b)[ b(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab) ] =900b --> Equation (3a)\n\nLet me divide equation (2a) by equation (3a):\n\n[ (a +b)[a(a +b) + ... ] ] / [ (a +b)[ b(a +b) + ... ] ] = (676a)/(900b )\n\nCancel out (a +b):\n\n[ a(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab) ] / [ b(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab) ] = (676a)/(900b )\n\nLet me denote the numerator as N and denominator as D:\n\nN = a(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab)\n\nD = b(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab)\n\nThen N/D = (676a)/(900b)\n\nLet me compute N - D:\n\nN - D = a(a +b) - b(a +b) = (a -b)(a +b)\n\nTherefore, N = D + (a -b)(a +b)\n\nSo, substituting back into N/D = (676a)/(900b )\n\nLet me write N = D + (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2). Since (a -b)(a +b)=a\u00b2 -b\u00b2.\n\nTherefore,\n\n[ D + (a\u00b2 -b\u00b2) ] / D = (676a)/(900b )\n\nSo,\n\n1 + (a\u00b2 -b\u00b2)/D = (676a)/(900b )\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/D = (676a)/(900b ) -1\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n= (676a -900b )/(900b )\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a\u00b2 -b\u00b2)/D = (676a -900b)/(900b )\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n900b(a\u00b2 -b\u00b2) = D(676a -900b )\n\nBut D = b(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab). Let me note that D is equal to:\n\nD = b(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab) = b S +576 -48k where S =a +b and k = sqrt(ab). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me substitute D into the equation:\n\n900b(a\u00b2 -b\u00b2) = [b(a +b) +576 -48 sqrt(ab)]*(676a -900b )\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Maybe there's a smarter substitution or perhaps assuming some relation between a and b?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to assume that a and b are integers or some multiples? Since the circumradius is 13 and 15, which are integers, maybe the sides are Pythagorean triples? Not sure, but let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables differently. Let me let\u2019s set variables like u = h and v = x - h. Then, since h = u and v =x - h, so x =u + v, and k\u00b2 = u*v. Let me also let\u2019s set k = sqrt(uv). Maybe that substitution can help.\n\nSo, variables u and v (positive numbers), and k = sqrt(uv). Let me rewrite equations (2a) and (3a):\n\nEquation (2a):\n\nx*(h x +576 -48k ) =676 h\n\nIn terms of u and v:\n\nx = u + v,\n\nh = u,\n\nso h x = u(u +v )\n\nTherefore,\n\n(u +v)[ u(u +v ) +576 -48 sqrt(uv) ] =676 u\n\nSimilarly, equation (3a):\n\n(x\u00b2 -xh)(x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k ) =900(x -h)^2\n\nExpressed in terms of u and v:\n\nx\u00b2 -xh = (u +v)^2 -u(u +v ) = u\u00b2 +2uv +v\u00b2 -u\u00b2 -uv = uv +v\u00b2 = v(u +v )\n\nThus,\n\nv(u +v ) * [ v(u +v ) +576 -48 sqrt(uv) ] =900 v\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by v (assuming v \u22600):\n\n(u +v )[ v(u +v ) +576 -48 sqrt(uv) ] =900v\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\nEquation (2a):\n\n(u +v)[ u(u +v ) +576 -48 sqrt(uv) ] =676 u --> Equation (2b)\n\nEquation (3a):\n\n(u +v )[ v(u +v ) +576 -48 sqrt(uv) ] =900 v --> Equation (3b)\n\nHmm, perhaps if we denote T = u +v, and S = sqrt(uv). Let me see:\n\nLet me set T = u +v,\n\nand let S = sqrt(uv). Then uv = S\u00b2.\n\nSo, note that:\n\nu(u +v ) =u T,\n\nv(u +v ) =v T,\n\nand sqrt(uv) = S.\n\nTherefore, equations become:\n\nEquation (2b):\n\nT [ u T +576 -48 S ] =676 u\n\nEquation (3b):\n\nT [ v T +576 -48 S ] =900 v\n\nHmm, perhaps we can write both equations as:\n\nFor equation (2b):\n\nT(u T +576 -48 S ) =676 u\n\n=> T u T +576 T -48 T S =676 u\n\n=> u T\u00b2 +576 T -48 T S -676 u =0\n\nSimilarly for equation (3b):\n\nv T\u00b2 +576 T -48 T S -900 v =0\n\nHmm, perhaps we can subtract these equations? Let me see.\n\nLet me denote equation (2b):\n\nu T\u00b2 -676 u +576 T -48 T S =0 --> Equation (2c)\n\nEquation (3b):\n\nv T\u00b2 -900 v +576 T -48 T S =0 --> Equation (3c)\n\nSubtract equation (2c) from equation (3c):\n\n(v T\u00b2 -900 v +576 T -48 T S ) - (u T\u00b2 -676 u +576 T -48 T S ) =0 -0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nv T\u00b2 -u T\u00b2 -900v +676 u + (576 T -576 T ) + (-48 T S +48 T S ) =0\n\nThus,\n\n(v -u) T\u00b2 -900v +676 u =0\n\nSo,\n\n(v -u) T\u00b2 =900v -676 u --> Equation (4)\n\nNote that T = u +v, so T\u00b2 = (u +v)^2 =u\u00b2 +2uv +v\u00b2.\n\nHmm, but equation (4) relates u and v through T.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can express variables in terms of ratios. Let me suppose that u = m *v, where m is some ratio. Let me let\u2019s set u = m v. Then since T = u +v = v(m +1).\n\nLet me let\u2019s define m = u / v, so that u = m v. Then, substitute into equations.\n\nLet me try this substitution. Let m = u/v, so u = m v. Then:\n\nEquation (4):\n\n(v -u) T\u00b2 =900v -676 u\n\nSubstitute u =m v:\n\n(v - m v ) T\u00b2 =900v -676 m v\n\nFactor v:\n\nv (1 -m ) T\u00b2 = v (900 -676 m )\n\nDivide both sides by v (since v \u22600):\n\n(1 -m ) T\u00b2 =900 -676 m --> Equation (4a)\n\nAlso, T = u +v = m v +v =v(m +1). So T\u00b2 =v\u00b2(m +1)^2\n\nSubstitute T\u00b2 into equation (4a):\n\n(1 -m ) v\u00b2 (m +1)^2 =900 -676 m\n\nHmm, this introduces v\u00b2. Let me see if we can find another equation involving v and m.\n\nLet me also note that S = sqrt(uv) = sqrt(m v^2 )= v sqrt(m )\n\nSo S = v sqrt(m )\n\nNow, let me substitute into equation (2b):\n\nEquation (2b):\n\nT [ u T +576 -48 S ] =676 u\n\nExpress all terms in terms of m and v.\n\nFirst, T =v(m +1),\n\nu =m v,\n\nS =v sqrt(m )\n\nThus,\n\nLeft side:\n\nT [ u T +576 -48 S ] =v(m +1)[ m v * v(m +1) +576 -48 v sqrt(m ) ]\n\n= v(m +1)[ m v\u00b2(m +1) +576 -48 v sqrt(m ) ]\n\nWait, let me compute term by term inside the brackets:\n\nu T = m v * v(m +1) =m v\u00b2 (m +1)\n\n576 is just 576,\n\n-48 S = -48 v sqrt(m )\n\nSo:\n\nLeft side:\n\nv(m +1)[ m v\u00b2 (m +1) +576 -48 v sqrt(m ) ]\n\nRight side: 676 u =676 m v\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\nv(m +1)[ m v\u00b2 (m +1) +576 -48 v sqrt(m ) ] =676 m v\n\nDivide both sides by v (v \u22600):\n\n(m +1)[ m v\u00b2 (m +1) +576 -48 v sqrt(m ) ] =676 m\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me see if there is a way to choose m such that terms simplify. Maybe assume m is a rational number? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying specific values for m?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if equation (4a) can be used to express v in terms of m.\n\nFrom equation (4a):\n\n(1 -m ) T\u00b2 =900 -676 m\n\nBut T =v(m +1), so T\u00b2 =v\u00b2 (m +1)^2\n\nThus:\n\n(1 -m ) v\u00b2 (m +1)^2 =900 -676 m\n\nTherefore,\n\nv\u00b2 = [900 -676 m ] / [ (1 -m )(m +1)^2 ]\n\nHmm, so we can write v\u00b2 as that expression. Let me note this as equation (5).\n\nNow, let's go back to equation (2b) expressed in terms of m and v:\n\n(m +1)[ m v\u00b2 (m +1) +576 -48 v sqrt(m ) ] =676 m\n\nLet me denote the term inside the big brackets as:\n\nTerm = m v\u00b2 (m +1) +576 -48 v sqrt(m )\n\nLet me substitute v\u00b2 from equation (5):\n\nTerm = m * [ (900 -676m)/ ( (1 -m)(m +1)^2 ) ] * (m +1) +576 -48 v sqrt(m )\n\nSimplify first part:\n\nm * [ (900 -676m)/ ( (1 -m)(m +1)^2 ) ] * (m +1) = m*(900 -676m)/( (1 -m)(m +1) )\n\nSo Term becomes:\n\n[ m(900 -676m) ] / [ (1 -m)(m +1) ) ] +576 -48 v sqrt(m )\n\nTherefore, the entire equation (2b):\n\n(m +1)* [ Term ] =676 m\n\n= (m +1)* [ (m(900 -676m))/( (1 -m)(m +1) ) +576 -48 v sqrt(m ) ] =676 m\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term inside the brackets multiplied by (m+1):\n\n(m +1)*[ m(900 -676m) / ( (1 -m)(m +1) ) ] = m(900 -676m)/(1 -m )\n\nSecond term: (m +1)*576\n\nThird term: (m +1)*(-48 v sqrt(m) )\n\nThus:\n\nTotal equation:\n\n[ m(900 -676m)/(1 -m ) ] +576(m +1 ) -48 v sqrt(m )(m +1 ) =676 m\n\nThis is getting extremely complicated. Perhaps this approach is not the best. Maybe I need a different strategy.\n\nLet me think again. Since the problem involves a rectangle and points with right angles and circumradii, maybe coordinate geometry with the right angle at X.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, point X lies on the circle with diameter AB? Wait, no. Wait, in general, if angle AXB is 90\u00b0, then X lies on the circle with diameter AB. Wait, yes! Because in a circle with diameter AB, any point on the circle will form a right angle with A and B. So the locus of X such that angle AXB is 90\u00b0 is the circle with diameter AB.\n\nBut since X is inside the rectangle, the intersection of this circle with the rectangle will give possible positions of X. Hmm, that might be helpful.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of X must satisfy the equation of the circle with diameter AB. Let me find the equation of that circle.\n\nPoints A(0,0) and B(x,0). The center is the midpoint of AB: (x/2,0), and the radius is x/2. Therefore, the equation is:\n\n( h - x/2 )\u00b2 + (k -0 )\u00b2 = (x/2 )\u00b2\n\nExpanding:\n\nh\u00b2 -x h + (x\u00b2)/4 +k\u00b2 = x\u00b2 /4\n\nSimplify:\n\nh\u00b2 -x h +k\u00b2 =0\n\nWait a second! That's exactly equation (1). So that checks out. So equation (1) is indeed the equation of the circle with diameter AB, which makes sense. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, X is on that circle.\n\nNow, since triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. Let me recall that in a triangle, if all angles are acute, then the square of each side is less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides.\n\nSo for triangle AXD:\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2,\n\nAX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > XD\u00b2,\n\nXD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > AX\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC.\n\nGiven that AD and BC are sides of the rectangle (24), so AD =24, BC=24.\n\nLet me consider triangle AXD first.\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2,\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > 24\u00b2.\n\nAlso,\n\nAX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > XD\u00b2,\n\nAX\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 > XD\u00b2,\n\nand\n\nXD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > AX\u00b2,\n\nXD\u00b2 +24\u00b2 > AX\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly for the other triangle.\n\nBut perhaps this is more of a constraint than helpful for finding the length.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the circumradius formulas, maybe we can use the fact that in any triangle, the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area). For triangle AXD, R=13, so:\n\n13 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4 * Area_AXD)\n\nWe already know AD=24, Area_AXD=12h (from earlier). So:\n\n13 = (AX * XD *24 )/(4*12h )\n\nSimplify denominator:4*12h=48h\n\nSo:\n\n13 = (24 AX * XD )/(48h )\n\n=> 13 = (AX * XD )/(2h )\n\nThus,\n\nAX * XD =26 h --> which is the same as equation (2). So that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC:\n\nR2=15=(BX * XC * BC)/(4*Area_BXC )\n\nBC=24, Area_BXC=12(x -h )\n\nThus,\n\n15=(BX * XC *24)/(4*12(x -h )) = (24 BX * XC )/(48(x -h )) = (BX * XC )/(2(x -h ))\n\nTherefore,\n\nBX * XC =30(x -h )\n\nWhich is the same as equation (3).\n\nSo equations (2) and (3) are just restatements of the circumradius conditions, so that's correct.\n\nHmm, so perhaps instead of going through substitutions, we can try to find some relationship between equations (2) and (3). Let me see.\n\nLet me recall that in equation (1a): k\u00b2 = h(x -h). So maybe we can write variables in terms of h and x.\n\nLet me see, let me consider equations (2) and (3):\n\nEquation (2):\n\nsqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =26h\n\nBut sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)=sqrt(h x) from equation (1). So sqrt(h x)*sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )=26h\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =26h / sqrt(h x )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nh\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 = (26h)^2 / (h x )\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n(676 h\u00b2)/(h x )=676h/x\n\nThus,\n\nh\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 =676h/x --> Equation (2b)\n\nSimilarly, equation (3):\n\nsqrt( (x -h)^2 +k^2 ) * sqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =30(x - h )\n\nLet me first compute sqrt( (x -h)^2 +k^2 ). From equation (1a): k\u00b2 = h(x -h ). So,\n\n(x -h)^2 +k^2 = (x -h)^2 + h(x -h )= (x -h)(x -h +h )= (x -h)x\n\nThus sqrt( (x -h)^2 +k^2 )= sqrt(x(x -h )).\n\nSimilarly, the second sqrt term:\n\nsqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nLet me compute (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 = (x -h)^2 +24\u00b2 -48k +k\u00b2\n\n= (x -h)^2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k\n\nFrom equation (1a), (x -h)^2 +k\u00b2 = (x -h)^2 + h(x -h )= (x -h)(x -h +h )=x(x -h )\n\nTherefore,\n\n(x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 =x(x -h ) +576 -48k\n\nTherefore, the second sqrt term is sqrt( x(x -h ) +576 -48k )\n\nThus equation (3) becomes:\n\nsqrt(x(x -h )) * sqrt( x(x -h ) +576 -48k ) =30(x -h )\n\nLet me denote sqrt(a)*sqrt(b)=sqrt(ab):\n\nsqrt[ x(x -h )*(x(x -h ) +576 -48k ) ] =30(x -h )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx(x -h )*(x(x -h ) +576 -48k ) =900(x -h )\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by (x -h ) (assuming x \u2260h, which it is since X is inside the rectangle):\n\nx*(x(x -h ) +576 -48k ) =900(x -h )\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx\u00b2(x -h ) +576x -48x k =900(x -h )\n\nHmm, this seems similar to equation (2b). Let me see equation (2b):\n\nFrom equation (2b):\n\nh\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 =676h/x\n\nLet me expand (24 -k)^2 =576 -48k +k\u00b2, so:\n\nh\u00b2 +576 -48k +k\u00b2 =676h/x\n\nBut h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =h x from equation (1). Substitute:\n\nh x +576 -48k =676h/x\n\nMultiply both sides by x:\n\nx h x +576x -48x k =676h\n\n=>x\u00b2 h +576x -48xk =676h --> Equation (2c)\n\nSimilarly, equation from (3):\n\nx*(x(x -h ) +576 -48k ) =900(x -h )\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx\u00b2(x -h ) +576x -48xk =900(x -h )\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx\u00b2(x -h ) -900(x -h ) +576x -48xk =0\n\nFactor (x -h ):\n\n(x -h )(x\u00b2 -900 ) +576x -48xk=0 --> Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that equation (2c):\n\nx\u00b2 h +576x -48xk =676h --> Equation (2c)\n\nEquation from (3):\n\nx\u00b2(x -h ) +576x -48xk =900(x -h )\n\nLet me subtract equation (2c) from this equation:\n\n[ x\u00b2(x -h ) +576x -48xk ] - [x\u00b2 h +576x -48xk ] =900(x -h ) -676h\n\nLeft side:\n\nx\u00b2(x -h ) -x\u00b2 h +576x -576x -48xk +48xk =x\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h -x\u00b2 h =x\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 h\n\nRight side:\n\n900x -900h -676h =900x - (900+676)h =900x -1576h\n\nTherefore:\n\nx\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 h =900x -1576h --> Equation (6)\n\nHmm, so now equation (6):x\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 h -900x +1576h =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can find a relation between h and x from equation (1). Recall that h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =h x (equation 1), and k\u00b2 =h(x -h ) (equation 1a). Let me see equation (1a): k\u00b2 =h(x -h ). So k = sqrt(h(x -h )).\n\nLet me see if I can express h in terms of x or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider h as a variable and express in terms of x, then substitute into equation (6).\n\nLet me suppose that h is a fraction of x. Let me set h = t x, where t is between 0 and1.\n\nSo h = t x, so 0 < t <1.\n\nThen k\u00b2 =h(x -h )= t x (x -t x )= t x\u00b2 (1 -t )\n\nThus, k =x sqrt( t (1 -t ) )\n\nLet me substitute h =t x into equation (2c) and equation (6).\n\nFirst, equation (2c):\n\nx\u00b2 h +576x -48xk =676h\n\nSubstituting h =t x and k =x sqrt(t(1 -t )):\n\nx\u00b2 (t x ) +576x -48x*(x sqrt(t(1 -t )) ) =676 t x\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx\u00b3 t +576x -48x\u00b2 sqrt(t(1 -t )) =676 t x\n\nDivide both sides by x (x\u22600):\n\nx\u00b2 t +576 -48x sqrt(t(1 -t )) =676 t\n\nRearranged:\n\nx\u00b2 t -676 t +576 =48x sqrt(t(1 -t )) --> Equation (2d)\n\nEquation (6):\n\nx\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 h -900x +1576h =0\n\nSubstitute h =t x:\n\nx\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 (t x ) -900x +1576 t x =0\n\nSimplify:\n\nx\u00b3 -2t x\u00b3 -900x +1576 t x =0\n\nFactor x:\n\nx( x\u00b2(1 -2t ) + (-900 +1576 t )) =0\n\nSince x is not zero (it's a rectangle side), so:\n\nx\u00b2(1 -2t ) + (-900 +1576 t )=0 --> Equation (6a)\n\nThus, equation (6a):\n\nx\u00b2 = (900 -1576 t )/(1 -2t )\n\nHmm, so x squared is expressed in terms of t. Let me note that.\n\nNow, equation (2d):\n\nx\u00b2 t -676 t +576 =48x sqrt(t(1 -t ))\n\nLet me express x\u00b2 from equation (6a) as:\n\nx\u00b2 = (900 -1576 t )/(1 -2t )\n\nSubstitute into equation (2d):\n\n[ (900 -1576 t )/(1 -2t ) ] * t -676 t +576 =48x sqrt(t(1 -t )) --> Equation (7)\n\nThis is still complex, but maybe we can express x from equation (6a) as:\n\nx = sqrt( (900 -1576 t )/(1 -2t ) )\n\nAssuming that the denominator 1 -2t must be positive, so 1 -2t >0 => t <0.5. Which is true since h =t x <x => t<1, but also since k\u00b2 =h(x -h ) must be positive, so h(x -h ) >0 implies h <x, so t <1, and also h>0, so t>0. Since we have t <0.5 from denominator.\n\nThus, sqrt(t(1 -t )) is real.\n\nSo, substituting x into equation (7):\n\nLet me denote x = sqrt( (900 -1576 t )/(1 -2t ) )\n\nLet me write equation (7):\n\nLeft side:\n\n[ (900t -1576 t\u00b2 )/(1 -2t ) ] -676t +576\n\nRight side:\n\n48 * sqrt( (900 -1576 t )/(1 -2t ) ) * sqrt(t(1 -t ))\n\nThis is quite involved. Perhaps we can square both sides after moving terms, but this might lead to a quartic equation. Alternatively, maybe the problem has integer solutions, so perhaps trying t as a rational fraction and see if things simplify.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find t such that numerator and denominator in the expression for x squared are multiples that can form squares or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that t is a simple fraction, like 1/5 or 3/10, and see if equations hold.\n\nLet me try t= 12/25 (random guess). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem's answer likely being an integer, so AB =x is an integer. Let me suppose x is an integer and see if possible.\n\nSuppose x is an integer. Let me consider equation (6a):\n\nx\u00b2 = (900 -1576t )/(1 -2t )\n\nSince x must be an integer, the RHS must be a perfect square. Let me suppose t is rational, so that the numerator and denominator can form a square.\n\nAlternatively, maybe x = 25 or 26? Since the circumradii are 13 and 15, which are factors of 13*2 and 15*2.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to see if x=25.\n\nLet me try x=25. Let me see.\n\nAssume x=25, then equation (6a):\n\n25\u00b2 = (900 -1576 t )/(1 -2t )\n\n=> 625*(1 -2t ) =900 -1576t\n\n=>625 -1250 t =900 -1576 t\n\nBring variables to left and constants to right:\n\n-1250t +1576t =900 -625\n\n326 t =275\n\nt=275/326 \u22480.843. But t must be less than 0.5, so invalid.\n\nHmm, not good.\n\nTry x= 26:\n\nx=26,\n\n26\u00b2= (900 -1576t )/(1 -2t )\n\n676*(1-2t)=900 -1576t\n\n676 -1352t=900 -1576t\n\nMove terms:\n\n-1352t +1576t =900 -676\n\n224t =224\n\nt=1. Hmm, t=1, but then h =x*t=26*1=26, but h must be less than x=26, so h=26 would be on the edge, but the rectangle's width is 24, so k= sqrt(h(x-h ))=sqrt(26*0)=0. So point X would be at (26,0), which is point B. But angle AXB would be undefined, as X coincides with B. So invalid.\n\nHmm, not good.\n\nTry x= 24. Wait, x is AB, which is the side we are to find, and BC is 24. So if x=24, the rectangle is a square. Let me check:\n\nx=24,\n\n24\u00b2 = (900 -1576t )/(1 -2t )\n\n576*(1-2t) =900 -1576t\n\n576 -1152 t =900 -1576t\n\n-1152t +1576t =900-576\n\n424t =324\n\nt=324/424 = 81/106\u22480.764. Again over 0.5.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, t must be less than 0.5, so let me try x= 15, maybe.\n\nx=15,\n\n225 = (900 -1576t )/(1-2t )\n\n225(1-2t)=900 -1576t\n\n225 -450t =900 -1576t\n\n-450t +1576t =900-225\n\n1126 t=675\n\nt\u22480.6.

Still over.\n\nHmm, this approach might not be working. Let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps I can consider that in both triangles AXD and BXC, their circumradii are given. Since the rectangle has BC=24, and the triangles involve AD=24 and BC=24.\n\nFor triangle AXD: sides AX, XD, AD=24, with circumradius 13.\n\nFor triangle BXC: sides BX, XC, BC=24, circumradius 15.\n\nPerhaps using the formula for circumradius:\n\nFor triangle AXD,\n\nR1 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4 * Area_AXD ) =13\n\nWe have AD=24, Area_AXD=12h,\n\nThus,\n\nAX * XD = (13 *4 *12h)/24 = (13 *48h)/24=26h, which matches equation (2).\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC,\n\nBX * XC = (15 *4 *12(x -h))/24 = (15*48(x-h))/24=30(x -h ), which matches equation (3).\n\nSo the equations are correct.\n\nLet me think of AX and XD in triangle AXD. Since AXD has sides AX, XD, and AD=24, and circumradius 13.\n\nSimilarly for the other triangle.\n\nPerhaps use the fact that in any triangle, the circumradius R = a/(2 sin A). So for triangle AXD, the side opposite to angle at X would be AD=24. Wait, let me see.\n\nIn triangle AXD, angle at X is between AX and XD. The side opposite to angle at X is AD=24.\n\nSo using the formula: R = AD/(2 sin \u03b8 ), where \u03b8 is angle at X.\n\nGiven R=13, so 13 =24/(2 sin \u03b8 ) \u2192 sin \u03b8=24/(26)=12/13. Thus angle at X in AXD has sin \u03b8=12/13, so angle is acute since sin is positive and less than1.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC, angle at X between BX and XC is opposite to BC=24. So R=15=24/(2 sin \u03c6 ), so sin \u03c6=24/(2*15)=24/30=4/5. Thus angle \u03c6 is acute as well (sin\u03c6=4/5 <1).\n\nTherefore, angles at X in both triangles AXD and BXC are acute, which aligns with the given condition.\n\nBut how does this help? Well, maybe using the sine formula for the other angles?\n\nAlternatively, in triangle AXD:\n\nUsing the Law of Sines:\n\nAX/sin(angle at D) = 2R =26\n\nXD/sin(angle at A) =26\n\nAD/sin(angle at X)=26\n\nWait, AD is 24, and R=13, so 24/(2 sin \u03b8)=13 \u21d2 sin\u03b8=12/13 as above.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC:\n\nBC=24, R=15 \u21d2 24/(2 sin\u03c6)=15 \u21d2 sin\u03c6=24/30=4/5 as above.\n\nHmm, perhaps not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider coordinates again. Let me suppose specific coordinates for X and see if I can find relationships.\n\nLet me consider that X is at (h,k), and since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so AX perpendicular to BX.\n\nAlso, k\u00b2 =h(x -h).\n\nLet me also note that in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, AD=24.\n\nThe circumradius is 13. So using the formula:\n\nR = (AX * XD * AD)/(4 * Area ) =13,\n\nand we already derived AX * XD =26h.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider AX and XD:\n\nAX = sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)=sqrt(hx),\n\nXD = sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nSo their product is sqrt(hx) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =26h.\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\nhx*(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )=676h\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by h (h\u22600):\n\nx*(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )=676h\n\nBut h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 = h\u00b2 + 576 -48k +k\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 ) +576 -48k = hx +576 -48k (since h\u00b2 +k\u00b2=hx)\n\nThus,\n\nx*(hx +576 -48k ) =676h\n\nWhich is equation (2a). So we are back to where we were.\n\nPerhaps we can combine this with equation from triangle BXC.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle BXC:\n\nBX * XC =30(x -h )\n\nBX = sqrt( (x -h)^2 +k^2 )=sqrt( x(x -h ) )\n\nXC = sqrt( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nProduct BX * XC = sqrt(x(x -h )) * sqrt( x(x -h ) +576 -48k ) =30(x -h )\n\nSquaring gives:\n\nx(x -h )(x(x -h ) +576 -48k ) =900(x -h )\u00b2\n\nDivide by (x -h ):\n\nx*(x(x -h ) +576 -48k )=900(x -h )\n\nThis is equation (3).\n\nFrom equation (2a):\n\nx*(h x +576 -48k ) =676h\n\nLet me note that in equation (3):\n\nx*(x(x -h ) +576 -48k )=900(x -h )\n\nLet me expand x(x -h ) =x\u00b2 -xh, so:\n\nx*(x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k ) =900(x -h )\n\nLet me rearrange equation (2a):\n\nx*(h x +576 -48k ) =676h \u21d2 x(hx) +x(576 -48k )=676h \u21d2x\u00b2 h +576x -48xk =676h\n\nSimilarly, equation (3):\n\nx*(x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k ) =900(x -h )\n\nExpand left side:\n\nx\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h +576x -48xk =900x -900h\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h +576x -48xk -900x +900h =0 \u21d2x\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h -324x -48xk +900h =0\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nBut perhaps subtract equation (2a) multiplied by something?\n\nFrom equation (2a): x\u00b2 h +576x -48xk =676h\n\nLet me multiply equation (2a) by x:\n\nx\u00b3 h +576x\u00b2 -48x\u00b2k =676x h\n\nSubtract this from equation (3):\n\n[ x\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h -324x -48xk +900h ] - [x\u00b3 h +576x\u00b2 -48x\u00b2k ] =0 -676x h\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nLet me consider that the problem is from a competition, so maybe there is an elegant solution using properties of rectangles and circles.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so point X lies on the circle with diameter AB.\n\nTriangles AXD and BXC are acute, so their opposite angles must be acute. Since in triangle AXD, angle at X is acute (as given), so the opposite side AD=24 must be less than the other sides? Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, given the circumradius formulas, perhaps the sides of the triangles can be related to the circumradius.\n\nFor triangle AXD with circumradius 13:\n\nThe sides are AX, XD, AD=24.\n\nUsing the formula R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area), so 13 = (AX * XD *24)/(4*12h )\n\nWhich gives AX * XD =26h as before.\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC:\n\n15 = (BX * XC *24)/(4*12(x -h )) \u21d2 BX * XC =30(x -h )\n\nLet me think of AX * XD =26h and BX * XC=30(x -h )\n\nAlso, note that AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2 (since acute), so AX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 >576.\n\nSimilarly, BX\u00b2 + XC\u00b2 > BC\u00b2=576.\n\nMaybe consider that in the circle with diameter AB, the coordinates of X satisfy h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =h x.\n\nLet me consider coordinates again.\n\nLet me set coordinate system with A(0,0), B(x,0), D(0,24), C(x,24). X(h,k).\n\nWe have angle AXB=90\u00b0 \u21d2 h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =h x.\n\nAlso, AXD has circumradius 13:\n\nAX * XD =26h,\n\nand BXC has circumradius 15 \u21d2 BX * XC =30(x -h )\n\nLet me consider that AX * XD =26h.\n\nAX = sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) =sqrt(hx),\n\nXD = sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(hx) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =26h\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nhx*(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =676h\u00b2\n\nDivide by h:\n\nx*(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) =676h\n\nExpand (24 -k)^2:\n\nh\u00b2 +576 -48k +k\u00b2 = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k = hx +576 -48k (since h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =hx)\n\nThus,\n\nx*(hx +576 -48k ) =676h \u2192 equation (2a).\n\nSimilarly for the other equation:\n\nBX = sqrt( (x\u2212h)^2 +k^2 ) = sqrt(x(x\u2212h )),\n\nXC = sqrt( (x\u2212h)^2 + (24\u2212k)^2 )\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(x(x\u2212h )) * sqrt( (x\u2212h)^2 + (24\u2212k)^2 ) =30(x\u2212h )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nx(x\u2212h )*( (x\u2212h)^2 + (24\u2212k)^2 ) =900(x\u2212h )^2\n\nDivide by (x\u2212h ):\n\nx*( (x\u2212h)^2 + (24\u2212k)^2 ) =900(x\u2212h )\n\nExpand (x\u2212h)^2 + (24\u2212k)^2:\n\n(x\u2212h)^2 +24\u00b2 -48k +k\u00b2 = (x\u2212h)^2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k\n\nBut (x\u2212h)^2 +k\u00b2 =x(x\u2212h )\n\nThus,\n\nx*(x(x\u2212h ) +576 -48k ) =900(x\u2212h )\n\n\u2192 equation (3).\n\nNow, let me consider equations (2a) and (3):\n\nEquation (2a):\n\nx*(hx +576 -48k ) =676h\n\nEquation (3):\n\nx*(x(x\u2212h ) +576 -48k ) =900(x\u2212h )\n\nLet me denote equation (3) as:\n\nx*(x(x\u2212h ) +576 -48k ) =900(x\u2212h )\n\nLet me rearrange equation (2a):\n\nx*(hx +576 -48k ) =676h \u21d2 hx\u00b2 +576x -48xk =676h\n\nEquation (3):\n\nx*(x(x\u2212h ) +576 -48k ) =900(x\u2212h )\n\nExpand inside:\n\nx*(x\u00b2 -xh +576 -48k ) =900x -900h\n\nMultiply out:\n\nx\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h +576x -48xk =900x -900h\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h +576x -48xk -900x +900h =0 \u21d2x\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h -324x -48xk +900h =0\n\nNow, from equation (2a):\n\nhx\u00b2 +576x -48xk =676h \u21d2 -48xk =676h -hx\u00b2 -576x\n\nSubstitute into equation (3's result):\n\nx\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h -324x +900h + (676h -hx\u00b2 -576x )=0\n\nCombine terms:\n\nx\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h -324x +900h +676h -hx\u00b2 -576x =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 h + ( -324x -576x ) + (900h +676h ) =0\n\nThus:\n\nx\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 h -900x +1576h =0 \u2192 which is equation (6).\n\nThus we are back to equation (6). Hmm.\n\nLet me try to combine equations (1a):k\u00b2=h(x\u2212h )\n\nand equation (2a):x*(hx +576 -48k )=676h\n\nLet me solve equation (2a) for the term involving k:\n\nx*(hx +576 -48k ) =676h \u21d2 x*(576 -48k ) =676h -x\u00b2 h\n\nDivide both sides by 48:\n\nx*(12 -k ) = (676h -x\u00b2 h)/48\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, express k from equation (1a):\n\nk = sqrt(h(x -h )),\n\nso substitute into equation (2a):\n\nx*(hx +576 -48 sqrt(h(x -h )) ) =676h\n\nThis is an equation in terms of h and x. It's complicated but maybe we can set h = something.\n\nSuppose h =x/2. Then k = sqrt( x/2 * x/2 )=x/2.

Check if triangles AXD and BXC are acute.\n\nTriangle AXD: points A(0,0), X(17,17), D(0,24).\n\nCompute sides:\n\nAX: sqrt(17\u00b2+17\u00b2)=17\u221a2\u224824.04\n\nXD: sqrt(17\u00b2 + (24-17)^2 )=sqrt(289+49)=sqrt(338)=18.3848\n\nAD=24.\n\nCheck if all angles are acute:\n\nAX\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > XD\u00b2 ?\n\n(17\u221a2)^2 +24\u00b2 = 578 +576=1154 > XD\u00b2=338 \u2192 yes.\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2 > AD\u00b2 ?\n\n578 +338=916 >576 \u2192 yes.\n\nXD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 > AX\u00b2 ?\n\n338 +576=914 >578 \u2192 yes. So AXD is acute.\n\nTriangle BXC: B(34,0), X(17,17), C(34,24).\n\nCompute sides:\n\nBX: sqrt( (17)^2 +17^2 )=17\u221a2\u224824.04\n\nXC: sqrt(17\u00b2 +7\u00b2)=sqrt(289+49)=sqrt(338)=18.3848\n\nBC=24.\n\nCheck angles:\n\nBX\u00b2 + XC\u00b2 > BC\u00b2 ?\n\n578 +338=916>576 \u2192 yes.\n\nBX\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 > XC\u00b2: 578+576=1154>338 \u2192 yes.\n\nXC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 > BX\u00b2: 338+576=914>578 \u2192 yes. So acute.\n\nThus, for x=34, the conditions are satisfied. So maybe the answer is 34?\n\nWait, but let me check the other solution x=14.\n\nx=14, h=7, k=7.\n\nCoordinates X(7,7).\n\nTriangle AXD: A(0,0), X(7,7), D(0,24).\n\nAX= sqrt(49+49)=7\u221a2\u22489.899,\n\nXD= sqrt(49 + (24-7)^2 )=sqrt(49+289)=sqrt(338)\u224818.3848,\n\nAD=24.\n\nCheck angles:\n\nAX\u00b2 + XD\u00b2= 98 +338=436 >24\u00b2=576 \u2192 436 <576 \u2192 Not greater. Thus angle at D would be obtuse. So triangle AXD is not acute. Thus x=14 is invalid.\n\nTherefore, only x=34 is valid.\n\nWait, so is the answer 34?\n\nWait, but let me verify the circumradii.\n\nFor x=34, h=17, k=17.\n\nTriangle AXD:\n\nSides: AX=17\u221a2, XD= sqrt(338), AD=24.\n\nCompute the circumradius:\n\nR1 = (AX * XD * AD )/(4 * Area )\n\nArea of AXD is 12h =12*17=204.\n\nThus,\n\nR1 = (17\u221a2 * sqrt(338)*24 )/(4*204 )\n\nCompute sqrt(338)=sqrt(2*169)=13\u221a2,\n\nThus,\n\nAX * XD =17\u221a2 *13\u221a2=17*13*2=442,\n\nSo,\n\nR1=(442 *24)/(4*204)= (442*24)/(816)= (442/34)=13. Which matches the given R1=13.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC:\n\nBX=17\u221a2, XC= sqrt( (17)^2 +7^2 )=sqrt(338)=13\u221a2,\n\nBC=24,\n\nArea of BXC is12(x\u2212h)=12*(34\u221217)=12*17=204,\n\nThus R2=(BX * XC * BC )/(4*Area )\n\nBX * XC=17\u221a2 *13\u221a2=17*13*2=442,\n\nThus,\n\nR2=(442*24)/(4*204)= same as above, which is (442*24)/(816)= (442/34)=13. Wait, but the given R2 is 15. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nWait, hold on, XC in this case is sqrt( (34-17)^2 + (24-17)^2 )=sqrt(17\u00b2 +7\u00b2)=sqrt( 289 +49 )=sqrt(338)=13\u221a2?\n\nWait sqrt(338)=sqrt(2*169)=13*sqrt(2). Yes. So BX=17\u221a2, XC=13\u221a2.\n\nThus, BX * XC= (17\u221a2)(13\u221a2)=17\u00d713\u00d72=442.\n\nThen R2 would be:\n\n(442\u00d724)/(4\u00d7204)= (442\u00d724)/(816)= (442/34)=13. But the problem states R2 is 15. So this is a contradiction. So x=34 would give R2=13 instead of 15. Thus, invalid.\n\nHmm, so my assumption that h=x/2 gives x=34 is incorrect because it leads to R2=13 instead of 15. So that approach is wrong.\n\nHmm, so maybe the answer is another value.\n\nWait, let me check calculations again for x=34:\n\nIn triangle BXC:\n\nBX is distance from B(34,0) to X(17,17):\n\nsqrt((34-17)^2 + (0-17)^2)=sqrt(289 +289)=sqrt(578)=17\u221a2\u224824.04.\n\nXC is distance from X(17,17) to C(34,24):\n\nsqrt( (34-17)^2 + (24-17)^2 )=sqrt(289+49)=sqrt(338)=~18.38.\n\nBC is 24.\n\nArea of BXC is 12*(x -h)=12*(34-17)=204.\n\nThen the circumradius R2 would be:\n\n(BX * XC * BC )/(4*Area )= (17\u221a2 \u00d713\u221a2\u00d724)/(4\u00d7204 )\n\nCalculates as:\n\nFirst multiply BX and XC:17\u221a2 \u00d713\u221a2=17\u00d713\u00d72=442.\n\nThen 442\u00d724= 10608.\n\nDenominator:4\u00d7204=816.\n\nThus, R2=10608 /816=13. So indeed 13 instead of 15. So that\u2019s not valid.\n\nHmm, so my mistake was assuming h=x/2, but that only satisfies one of the circumradius conditions.\n\nHmm, perhaps the correct solution requires another approach.\n\nLet me think back to the equations.\n\nEquation (6):x\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 h -900x +1576h =0.\n\nEquation (1a):k\u00b2=h(x\u2212h ).\n\nEquation (2a):x*(hx +576 -48k )=676h.\n\nPerhaps I can express k from equation (2a) and substitute into equation (1a).\n\nFrom equation (2a):\n\nx*(hx +576 -48k )=676h \u21d2 solve for k:\n\nx*hx +576x -48x k =676h \u21d2 -48xk =676h -hx\u00b2 -576x \u21d2\n\nk=(hx\u00b2 +576x -676h )/(48x )\n\nThus,\n\nk=(h x\u00b2 +576x -676h )/(48x )\n\nBut from equation (1a):k\u00b2 =h(x -h )\n\nThus,\n\n[ (h x\u00b2 +576x -676h )/(48x ) ]\u00b2 =h(x -h )\n\nThis is an equation in h and x. It's a quartic equation but maybe can be simplified.\n\nLet me denote this as equation (8):\n\n(h x\u00b2 +576x -676h )\u00b2 = (48x )\u00b2 h(x -h )\n\nThis is very complicated, but perhaps suppose that h is a multiple of x or something.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that h = p x, where p is a fraction between 0 and1.\n\nLet me set h = p x. Then, since h = p x,\n\nk = sqrt( h(x -h )) = sqrt(p x (x -p x ))=sqrt(p (1-p )x\u00b2 )=x sqrt(p (1-p )).\n\nAlso, substituting h =p x into equation (2a):\n\nx*(h x +576 -48k ) =676h\n\nSubstitute h=p x and k=x sqrt(p(1-p )):\n\nx*(p x\u00b2 +576 -48x sqrt(p(1-p )) )=676p x\n\nDivide both sides by x (x\u22600):\n\np x\u00b2 +576 -48x sqrt(p(1-p )) =676p\n\nRearrange:\n\np x\u00b2 -676p +576 =48x sqrt(p(1-p )) \u2192 equation (9)\n\nNow, equation (6):\n\nx\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 h -900x +1576h =0\n\nSubstitute h=p x:\n\nx\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 (p x ) -900x +1576p x =0 \u21d2x\u00b3 -2p x\u00b3 -900x +1576p x =0 \u21d2x\u00b2(1-2p ) +x(-900 +1576p )=0\n\nFactor x:\n\nx [ x(1 -2p ) +(-900 +1576p ) ]=0\n\nSince x\u22600,\n\nx(1 -2p ) +(-900 +1576p )=0 \u21d2x = (900 -1576p )/(1 -2p ) \u2192 equation (10)\n\nNow, substitute x from equation (10) into equation (9):\n\np x\u00b2 -676p +576 =48x sqrt(p(1-p )) \n\nReplace x with (900-1576p)/(1-2p )\n\nThis is very involved, but let me denote:\n\nLet me set x = (900 -1576p )/(1 -2p )\n\nThen equation (9) becomes:\n\np [ (900 -1576p )/(1 -2p ) ]\u00b2 -676p +576 =48*(900 -1576p )/(1 -2p ) * sqrt(p(1-p )) \n\nThis is extremely complex, but perhaps try to find a p that makes this equation true.\n\nGiven that the problem is likely to have an integer solution for x, perhaps the value of p is a simple fraction.\n\nLet me assume p is a rational number such that denominators divide into integers. Let me try p = 13/25 or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps p = 12/25.\n\nWait, let me suppose that x= 34 as before but that didn't work. Alternatively, perhaps x= 40, let me try.\n\nWait, alternatively, let me see if x= 40.\n\nLet me try x=40.\n\nEquation (6):40\u00b3 -2*40\u00b2 h -900*40 +1576h =0\n\nCompute:\n\n64000 - 3200h -36000 +1576h =0 \u21d2(64000-36000) + (-3200h +1576h)=0 \u21d228000 -1624h=0 \u21d21624h=28000 \u21d2h=28000/1624\u224817.25.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to find p such that equation (10) gives x as an integer.\n\nSuppose p = 0.25.\n\nThen,\n\nx=(900 -1576*0.25)/(1 -2*0.25 )=(900 -394)/0.5=506/0.5=1012.

But then denominator 1-2p= -0.2, so x would be negative. Not possible.\n\nHmm, maybe p= 0.35:\n\nx=(900 -1576*0.35)/ (1-0.7)= (900 -551.6)/0.7\u2248348.4/0.7\u2248497.7.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, p= 0.22:\n\nx=(900 -1576*0.22)/(1-0.44)= (900 -346.72)/0.56\u2248553.28/0.56\u2248988.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nMaybe p= 0.1:\n\nx=(900 -1576*0.1)/0.8= (900-157.6)/0.8=742.4/0.8=928.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps p=5/13.\n\nLet me try p=5/13\u22480.3846.\n\nThen,\n\nx=(900 -1576*(5/13))/(1 -2*(5/13)).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n1576*(5)/13=(1576/13)*5=121.23*5\u2248606.15\n\nThus,\n\n900 -606.15\u2248293.85\n\nDenominator:1 -10/13=3/13 \u22480.2308\n\nThus,\n\nx\u2248293.85/(0.2308)\u22481273.

So incorrect.\n\nWait maybe there is another symmetric case where h = (something else).\n\nSuppose that in triangle BXC, the angle at X has sin \u03c6=4/5, so opposing side BC=24, so the hypotenuse of some triangle?\n\nAlternatively, think of triangle BXC with circumradius 15.\n\nThus, BC=24 is one side, and the other sides are BX and XC.\n\nThe circumradius R=15, so using the formula:\n\nR = (BX * XC * BC)/(4 * Area_BXC )\n\nThus:\n\n15 = (BX * XC *24)/(4 *12(x -h )) \u21d2 BX * XC = (15 *4 *12(x -h ))/(24 )= 30(x -h )\n\nWhich is consistent with previous.\n\nLet me suppose that in triangle BXC, the sides BX and XC are such that BX=25, XC= 15*2=30? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that triangle BXC has sides 9,12,15 (a 3-4-5 triangle scaled by 3), with circumradius 15/2* something. Wait, 15 is the circumradius.\n\nWait, for a right-angled triangle with hypotenuse 30, the circumradius is 15. So if triangle BXC is right-angled, but the problem states it's acute, so not right-angled.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, if triangle BXC has sides such that a*b*c/(4*Area)=15,\n\nSuppose BX=25, XC=15, BC=24.\n\nThen area via Heron's formula:\n\ns=(25+15+24)/2=32,\n\nArea= sqrt(32*(32-25)*(32-15)*(32-24 ))=sqrt(32*7*17*8)=sqrt(32*8*7*17)=sqrt(256*7*17)=16*sqrt(119). Not a nice number.\n\nCircumradius would be (25*15*24)/(4*16*sqrt(119 )) which is not 15.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangles are 13-14-15 triangles or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is to note that both AX * XD =26h and BX * XC=30(x\u2212h ).\n\nLet me consider multiplying these two equations:\n\nAX * XD * BX * XC =26h *30(x -h )=780h(x -h )\n\nBut AX * BX is sqrt(hx) * sqrt(x(x\u2212h ))=sqrt(hx *x(x\u2212h ))=x sqrt(h(x\u2212h ))=x k.\n\nSimilarly, XD * XC= sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24\u2212k )\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (x\u2212h )\u00b2 + (24\u2212k )\u00b2 )\n\nThis might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the product AX * BX =xk from above.\n\nThus,\n\nAX * BX =xk,\n\nand AX * XD * BX * XC =xk * XD * XC =xk *30(x\u2212h )\n\nSo,\n\nxk *30(x\u2212h )=780h(x -h )\n\nDivide both sides by (x -h ) (assuming x\u2260h):\n\n30xk =780h \u21d2xk=26h \u21d2k=26h/x.\n\nFrom equation (1a):k\u00b2 =h(x -h )\n\nThus,\n\n(26h/x )\u00b2 =h(x -h )\n\n\u21d2676h\u00b2/x\u00b2 =h(x -h )\n\nDivide both sides by h (assuming h\u22600):\n\n676h/x\u00b2 =x -h \u21d2676h =x\u00b2(x -h )\n\nThis is a new equation.\n\nLet me write this as equation (11):\n\nx\u00b2(x -h )=676h\n\nHmm, this is a new equation derived from combining AX * XD * BX * XC =780h(x\u2212h ) and AX * BX =xk with k=26h/x.\n\nNow, equation (11):x\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h -676h =0 \u21d2x\u00b3 =h(x\u00b2 +676 )\n\nEquation (6):x\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 h -900x +1576h =0\n\nNow substitute x\u00b3 from equation (11) into equation (6):\n\nh(x\u00b2 +676 ) -2x\u00b2 h -900x +1576h =0\n\nExpand:\n\nh x\u00b2 +676h -2x\u00b2 h -900x +1576h =0 \u21d2-x\u00b2 h + (676h +1576h ) -900x =0 \u21d2-x\u00b2 h +2252h -900x =0 \u21d2h(-x\u00b2 +2252 )=900x \u21d2h= (900x)/(2252 -x\u00b2 )\n\nNow, substitute this into equation (11):\n\nx\u00b2(x -h )=676h \u21d2x\u00b2x -x\u00b2 h=676h \u21d2x\u00b3 =h(x\u00b2 +676 )\n\nBut from equation (11), this is already satisfied. Thus, the substitution is consistent.\n\nNow, we have h expressed in terms of x:\n\nh= (900x)/(2252 -x\u00b2 )\n\nNow, substitute this into equation (1a):k\u00b2 =h(x -h )\n\nThus,\n\nk\u00b2 = [900x/(2252 -x\u00b2 ) ]*(x - [900x/(2252 -x\u00b2 ) ]) = [900x/(2252 -x\u00b2 ) ]*( [x(2252 -x\u00b2 ) -900x ]/(2252 -x\u00b2 ) )\n\nSimplify numerator inside the brackets:\n\nx(2252 -x\u00b2 ) -900x =2252x -x\u00b3 -900x = (2252x -900x ) -x\u00b3 =1352x -x\u00b3\n\nThus,\n\nk\u00b2 = [900x/(2252 -x\u00b2 ) ]*( (1352x -x\u00b3 )/(2252 -x\u00b2 ) )\n\n=900x*(1352x -x\u00b3 ) / (2252 -x\u00b2 )\u00b2\n\nBut also from equation (1a), k=26h/x, so k\u00b2= (26h/x )\u00b2=676h\u00b2/x\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\n676h\u00b2/x\u00b2 =900x*(1352x -x\u00b3 )/(2252 -x\u00b2 )\u00b2\n\nSubstitute h=(900x)/(2252 -x\u00b2 ):\n\nLeft side:\n\n676*( (900x/(2252 -x\u00b2 ))^2 ) /x\u00b2 =676*(810000x\u00b2)/( (2252 -x\u00b2 )\u00b2 ) /x\u00b2 =676*810000/( (2252 -x\u00b2 )\u00b2 )\n\nRight side:\n\n900x*(1352x -x\u00b3 )/(2252 -x\u00b2 )\u00b2\n\nThus:\n\n676*810000 =900x*(1352x -x\u00b3 )\n\nDivide both sides by 900:\n\n676*810000/900 =x*(1352x -x\u00b3 )\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n676*900 =x*(1352x -x\u00b3 )\n\nWait, 810000 divided by 900 is 900, so:\n\n676*900 =x*(1352x -x\u00b3 )\n\nThus,\n\n608400 =x^4 -1352x\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx^4 -1352x\u00b2 -608400 =0\n\nLet me set y =x\u00b2:\n\ny\u00b2 -1352y -608400=0\n\nSolve quadratic equation:\n\ny = [1352 \u00b1\u221a(1352\u00b2 +4*608400 )]/2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n1352\u00b2= (1350+2)^2=1350\u00b2 +4*1350 +4=1,822,500 +5,400 +4=1,827,904\n\n4*608400=2,433,600\n\nTotal discriminant=1,827,904 +2,433,600=4,261,504\n\n\u221a4,261,504=2064.\n\nBecause 2064\u00b2=(2000+64)^2=2000\u00b2+2*2000*64+64\u00b2=4,000,000+256,000+4,096=4,260,096.

Let me check the steps again.\n\nStarting from AX * XD * BX * XC =780h(x -h )\n\nAX * BX =xk,\n\nSo the product becomes xk * XD * XC =xk *30(x -h )\n\nThus,\n\nxk*30(x -h )=780h(x -h ) \u21d230xk =780h \u21d2xk=26h \u21d2k=26h/x.\n\nThis is correct.\n\nThen equation (1a):k\u00b2=h(x -h )\n\nThus,\n\n(26h/x )\u00b2 =h(x -h )\n\n\u2192 676h\u00b2/x\u00b2 =h(x -h )\n\nDivide by h:\n\n676h/x\u00b2 =x -h,\n\nMultiply by x\u00b2:\n\n676h =x\u00b2(x -h )\n\n\u2192x\u00b3 -x\u00b2 h -676h =0 \u2192 equation (11).\n\nEquation (6):\n\nx\u00b3 -2x\u00b2 h -900x +1576h =0.\n\nSubstitute x\u00b3 from equation (11):\n\nx\u00b3 =x\u00b2 h +676h,\n\nThus,\n\n(x\u00b2 h +676h ) -2x\u00b2 h -900x +1576h =0 \u21d2-x\u00b2 h +676h +1576h -900x =0 \u21d2-x\u00b2 h +2252h -900x =0 \u21d2h(-x\u00b2 +2252)=900x \u21d2h=900x/(2252 -x\u00b2 )\n\nCorrect.\n\nNow substitute into equation (11):\n\nx\u00b3 =h(x\u00b2 +676 )\n\nSubstitute h:\n\nx\u00b3 = [900x/(2252 -x\u00b2 ) ]*(x\u00b2 +676 )\n\nMultiply both sides by (2252 -x\u00b2 ):\n\nx\u00b3(2252 -x\u00b2 ) =900x(x\u00b2 +676 )\n\nDivide both sides by x (x\u22600):\n\nx\u00b2(2252 -x\u00b2 ) =900(x\u00b2 +676 )\n\nExpand left side:\n\n2252x\u00b2 -x\u2074 =900x\u00b2 +900\u00d7676\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n2252x\u00b2 -x\u2074 -900x\u00b2 -608,400 =0 \u21d2-x\u2074 +1352x\u00b2 -608,400 =0 \u21d2x\u2074 -1352x\u00b2 +608,400=0.\n\nThus discriminant is 1352\u00b2 -4\u00d71\u00d7608400 =1,827,904 -2,433,600 =-605,696.\n\nNegative discriminant. Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests inconsistency in the equations, which means perhaps an earlier mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps there was an error in combining the equations.\n\nLet me retrace steps:\n\nAX * XD * BX * XC = (AX * XD )*(BX * XC )=26h *30(x\u2212h )=780h(x\u2212h )\n\nAX*X B = sqrt(hx)*sqrt(x(x\u2212h ))=sqrt(hx *x(x\u2212h ))=x*sqrt(h(x\u2212h ))=xk.\n\nXD * XC = sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24\u2212k )\u00b2 )*sqrt( (x\u2212h )\u00b2 + (24\u2212k )\u00b2 ). This term is not easily simplified.\n\nThus, my previous assumption that (AX * BX)*(XD * XC)=xk *30(x\u2212h ) might be incorrect because the product AX * XD * BX * XC is not equal to (AX * BX)*(XD * XC), but rather (AX * BX)*(XD * XC) is indeed the same as AX * BX * XD * XC. So that part is correct.\n\nThe mistake must be elsewhere.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when I computed k=26h/x from xk=26h, but the equation AX * BX =xk comes from AX being sqrt(hx), BX being sqrt(x(x\u2212h)), so their product is sqrt(hx *x(x\u2212h ))=x*sqrt(h(x\u2212h ))=xk, which is correct. So that is correct.\n\nThus, the equations are correct, but the resulting quartic has no real solutions, which is impossible.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to parse it out. The problem is about a rectangle ABCD with BC = 24. There's a point X inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, and they have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively. I need to find the length of AB. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, let me sketch the rectangle mentally. Let me label the rectangle so that AB is one side, BC is another. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB = CD and BC = AD. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. So BC is one of the longer sides? Wait, but they told BC = 24. Hmm. Since ABCD is a rectangle, then BC is adjacent to B, so BC is one of the sides. Depending on the labeling, maybe AB and CD are the lengths, and BC and AD are the widths? Wait, maybe I need to fix the coordinates here. Let me assign coordinates to make it easier.\n\nLet me place point A at the origin (0,0). Then, since it's a rectangle, if AB is along the x-axis, then point B would be at (AB, 0). Then point C would be at (AB, BC), which is (AB, 24), and point D would be at (0,24). Is that right? Let me confirm: A(0,0), B(AB,0), C(AB,24), D(0,24). Yeah, that's a rectangle with sides AB and BC=24. So the problem is to find AB, which is the horizontal side.\n\nNow, point X is inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. So angle at X between points A and B is 90 degrees. So that would mean that triangle AXB is right-angled at X. Hmm, right. Since X is inside the rectangle, that gives some constraints on its position.\n\nAlso, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. So both of these triangles have all angles less than 90 degrees. Their circumradii are given: AXD has circumradius 13, and BXC has circumradius 15. So I need to use the circumradius formulas here.\n\nFirst, let's recall that for any triangle, the circumradius R is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*Area), where a, b, c are the sides. Alternatively, in a right-angled triangle, the circumradius is half the hypotenuse. Wait, but here triangles AXD and BXC are not necessarily right-angled, but they are acute. However, triangle AXB is right-angled. So maybe I can use coordinates to model all this.\n\nLet me set coordinates as I thought earlier. Let me denote AB as the length we need to find, let's call that length 'a'. Then BC is 24, so the rectangle has sides of length a and 24. So coordinates:\n\nA(0,0), B(a,0), C(a,24), D(0,24). Point X is inside the rectangle, so its coordinates are (x,y), where 0 < x < a and 0 < y <24.\n\nGiven that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so the vectors XA and XB are perpendicular. The vector from X to A is ( -x, -y), and from X to B is (a - x, -y). Their dot product should be zero.\n\nSo, (-x)(a - x) + (-y)(-y) = 0.\n\nThat gives: -ax + x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 0.\n\nSo equation (1): x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 =0.\n\nOkay, that's one equation involving x and y.\n\nNow, triangles AXD and BXC are acute. Let me note that first, but maybe I can come back to that. Let's first handle the circumradius conditions.\n\nFirst, for triangle AXD. Let's compute its circumradius. The triangle AXD has vertices at A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). To compute its circumradius, perhaps using the formula R = (side1 * side2 * side3)/(4*Area). Let me compute the sides first.\n\nFirst, compute the lengths:\n\nAX: distance from A to X: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nXD: distance from X to D: sqrt( (x - 0)^2 + (y -24)^2 ) = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (y -24)^2 )\n\nAD: distance from A to D: that's 24, since AD is vertical side from (0,0) to (0,24). Wait, but in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, but in triangle AXD, the three vertices are A, X, D. So the sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, no. Wait, the three sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, no, actually, the three sides are AX, XD, and AD? Wait, actually, triangle AXD has vertices A, X, D, so the sides are:\n\nAX: between A and X,\n\nXD: between X and D,\n\nand AD: between A and D. Wait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, but is that part of the triangle? Yes, because the triangle connects A to D directly. Wait, but hold on, actually in triangle AXD, the three sides are AX, XD, and AD. Wait, but that would make AD a side, which is 24 units. But maybe that's correct.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, it says triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. So triangle AXD must have all angles less than 90 degrees. Similarly for BXC. So perhaps I need to ensure that when I compute coordinates, those conditions are satisfied, but maybe the circumradius condition will take care of that.\n\nBut let's first proceed with the circumradius. Let me compute the sides of triangle AXD.\n\nAX: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nXD: sqrt( (x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nAD: 24 (since from (0,0) to (0,24))\n\nSo sides are AX, XD, AD.\n\nWait, but triangle AXD can also be considered with the three sides as AX, XD, and AD. So the sides are AX, XD, and AD. Let me confirm:\n\nDistance from A to X: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)\n\nFrom X to D: sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nFrom A to D: 24.\n\nTherefore, the sides are indeed those three.\n\nSimilarly, the triangle BXC has vertices at B(a,0), X(x,y), and C(a,24). So sides:\n\nBX: sqrt( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC: sqrt( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nBC: 24 (distance from B to C).\n\nSo sides for triangle BXC are BX, XC, BC.\n\nNow, the circumradius for triangle AXD is 13, and for BXC is 15.\n\nLet me recall the formula for the circumradius of a triangle with sides a, b, c:\n\nR = (a*b*c)/(4*Area)\n\nSo, for triangle AXD, let me denote the sides as:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s call the sides of triangle AXD as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let side1 = AX = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\nside2 = XD = sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ),\n\nside3 = AD = 24.\n\nSo the circumradius R1 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4 * Area of AXD).\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, sides:\n\nside1 = BX = sqrt( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 ),\n\nside2 = XC = sqrt( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ),\n\nside3 = BC = 24,\n\nso circumradius R2 = (BX * XC * BC)/(4 * Area of BXC).\n\nWe know R1 =13, R2=15.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I can write equations for both R1 and R2.\n\nBut this might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe there is another way to compute the circumradius for a triangle given coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle is acute, maybe the circumradius can also be expressed in terms of other properties. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates, the circumradius can be found via coordinates of the three points. For a triangle with coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), the circumradius can be calculated via determinant formulas, but that might be messy. Alternatively, maybe using the formula involving coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for circumradius in terms of sides and angles:\n\nR = a/(2 sin A), where A is the angle opposite side a. But since the triangle is acute, all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so their sines are positive, but not sure if that helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up equations for the circumradii using the sides and areas.\n\nLet me try with triangle AXD first.\n\nFirst, let me compute the Area of AXD. Since points A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24). The area can be computed via the determinant formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)| (0*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - y) ) | = (1/2)| 24x | = 12x.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the area of triangle AXD is 12x.\n\nWait, let me verify that calculation again:\n\nThe area using coordinates:\n\nThe formula is (1/2)|x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|\n\nFor points A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24):\n\nPlugging in:\n\n(1/2)|0*(y - 24) + x*(24 - 0) + 0*(0 - y)| = (1/2)|0 + 24x + 0| = (1/2)(24x) = 12x. So yes, that's correct. So area is 12x.\n\nSimilarly, the area of triangle BXC: points B(a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24).\n\nCompute area:\n\n(1/2)|a*(y -24) + x*(24 -0) + a*(0 - y)|\n\nWait, let's use the same formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)|x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)|\n\nPlugging in B(a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24):\n\n= (1/2)| a*(y -24) + x*(24 -0) + a*(0 - y) |\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: a*(y -24)\n\nSecond term: x*(24)\n\nThird term: a*( - y )\n\nSo overall:\n\n= (1/2)| a(y -24) + 24x - a y |\n\nSimplify inside the absolute value:\n\na(y -24) - a y +24x = a y -24a - a y +24x = -24a +24x =24(x -a)\n\nThus, area is (1/2)*|24(x - a)| =12| x -a |. Since X is inside the rectangle, x is between 0 and a, so x -a is negative, so absolute value makes it 12(a -x). So area of triangle BXC is 12(a -x).\n\nOkay, so now we have area expressions. Now let's write the formula for R1 (circumradius of AXD):\n\nR1 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4 * Area AXD) = [ sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * 24 ] / (4 * 12x )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12x =48x\n\nNumerator: 24*sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)*sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nThus, R1 = [24 * sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / (48x )\n\nSimplify 24/48 = 1/2. So R1 = [ sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / (2x) =13\n\nSo:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) / (2x) =13\n\nSimilarly for R2 (circumradius of BXC):\n\nR2 = (BX * XC * BC)/(4 * Area BXC) = [ sqrt( (a - x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a - x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) * 24 ] / (4 *12(a -x) )\n\nDenominator: 4*12(a -x) =48(a -x)\n\nNumerator: 24* sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nThus R2 = [24 * sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / [48(a -x) ]\n\nSimilarly, 24/48=1/2, so R2 = [ sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) ] / [2(a -x) ] =15\n\nTherefore, equations (2) and (3):\n\nEquation (2): sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 26x (since 13 * 2x)\n\nEquation (3): sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) * sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 30(a -x) (since 15 * 2(a -x))\n\nHmm, these equations look complex. Maybe I can square both sides to eliminate the square roots?\n\nLet me start with equation (2):\n\nsqrt(A) * sqrt(B) = 26x, so squaring both sides:\n\nA * B = (26x)^2, where A = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2, B = x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2.\n\nSo,\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = (26x)^2.\n\nSimilarly for equation (3):\n\nLet me denote C = (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2, D = (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2,\n\nthen sqrt(C)*sqrt(D)=30(a -x),\n\nso CD = [30(a -x)]\u00b2.\n\nTherefore:\n\n[(a -x)^2 + y\u00b2][(a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] = 900(a -x)^2.\n\nOkay, that gives two equations. Let me try to expand equation (2) first.\n\nStarting with equation (2):\n\nLet me compute (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nFirst, expand (24 - y)^2 = 24\u00b2 -48y + y\u00b2,\n\nso:\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + 24\u00b2 -48y + y\u00b2 )\n\nLet me denote x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 as S.\n\nThen, the expression becomes S*( S + 24\u00b2 -48y )\n\nWait, let me compute term by term:\n\nMultiply (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\n= (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + 576 -48y + y\u00b2 )\n\n= x\u00b2(x\u00b2 + 576 -48y + y\u00b2) + y\u00b2(x\u00b2 + 576 -48y + y\u00b2 )\n\nExpand term by term:\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2*(x\u00b2) + x\u00b2*576 - x\u00b2*48y + x\u00b2*y\u00b2\n\nSecond term: y\u00b2*x\u00b2 + y\u00b2*576 - y\u00b2*48y + y\u00b2*y\u00b2\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\nx^4 + 576x\u00b2 -48x\u00b2 y +x\u00b2 y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 y\u00b2 +576 y\u00b2 -48 y^3 + y^4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nx^4 + y^4 + (x\u00b2 y\u00b2 + x\u00b2 y\u00b2) + 576x\u00b2 +576y\u00b2 -48x\u00b2 y -48 y^3\n\nSimplify:\n\nx^4 + y^4 + 2x\u00b2 y\u00b2 +576(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -48x\u00b2 y -48 y^3\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there is a better way. Alternatively, notice that (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) can be written as:\n\nLet me denote A = x\u00b2, B = y\u00b2, C = (24 - y)^2 = 576 -48y + y\u00b2.\n\nWait, so (A + B)(A + C) = (A + B)(A + 576 -48y + B )\n\nWait, since C = 576 -48y + B.\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2) = [x\u00b2 + y\u00b2][x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2]\n\nLet me let z = y, then perhaps rewrite terms in terms of (24 - y)?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's symmetry here. Alternatively, maybe use substitution from equation (1).\n\nRecall equation (1): x\u00b2 - a x + y\u00b2 =0 => x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x. That's from angle AXB being 90\u00b0, so that's a key equation. So that gives x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x. That might help in simplifying equation (2).\n\nAh! That's a good point. Since equation (1) gives x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x, so S = a x. Let me use that.\n\nSo equation (2):\n\n(S)*(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = (26x)^2.\n\nBut since S = a x,\n\nSo, (a x)*(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 676x\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by x (assuming x \u22600, which it must be since area AXD is 12x and triangle is non-degenerate, so x>0):\n\na*(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) = 676x\n\nSo equation (2a): a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =676x\n\nSimilarly, perhaps equation (3) can be handled with substitutions.\n\nLet me see equation (3):\n\n[(a -x)^2 + y\u00b2][(a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] = 900(a -x)^2\n\nHmm, perhaps we can do similar substitutions here. Let me note that in equation (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x. Let me see if I can express (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 in terms of that.\n\nCompute (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 = a\u00b2 - 2a x +x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a\u00b2 -2a x + (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = a\u00b2 -2a x + a x (from equation (1)) = a\u00b2 -a x.\n\nSo that's nice! So (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 = a\u00b2 -a x.\n\nSimilarly, let me compute (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2.\n\nLet me expand that:\n\n(a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = a\u00b2 - 2a x +x\u00b2 + 576 -48y + y\u00b2.\n\nAgain, group terms:\n\na\u00b2 -2a x + x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + 576 -48y.\n\nBut x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x, so substitute that in:\n\na\u00b2 -2a x + a x +576 -48y = a\u00b2 -a x +576 -48y.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write that as (a\u00b2 -a x +576) -48y.\n\nHmm, so (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = a\u00b2 -a x +576 -48y.\n\nHmm, but maybe I can relate that to something else?\n\nAlternatively, let me denote some variables here.\n\nLet me consider variables u = a -x and v =24 - y. Since X is inside the rectangle, u = a -x would be between 0 and a, and v =24 - y would be between 0 and24. Maybe that substitution would help.\n\nLet me set u = a -x and v =24 - y. Then x = a - u, y =24 -v. Since x and y are inside the rectangle, u and v are positive and less than a and 24 respectively.\n\nLet me try substituting into equation (1):\n\nOriginal equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x.\n\nSubstituting x =a - u, y=24 -v,\n\nWe get (a - u)^2 + (24 - v)^2 =a(a -u )\n\nExpand left side:\n\na\u00b2 - 2a u +u\u00b2 + 576 -48v +v\u00b2 =a\u00b2 -a u\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na\u00b2 -2a u +u\u00b2 +576 -48v +v\u00b2 -a\u00b2 +a u =0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(-a u) + u\u00b2 +576 -48v +v\u00b2 =0,\n\nThus,\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 -a u -48v +576 =0.\n\nHmm, not sure if helpful yet, but let's see.\n\nBut perhaps using u and v can simplify equations (2a) and (3).\n\nFirst, equation (2a): a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ) =676x.\n\nLet me compute x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2. Since (24 - y) is v, so (24 - y)^2 =v\u00b2. And x =a -u,\n\nThus x\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (a -u)^2 +v\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, equation (2a):\n\na*( (a -u)^2 +v\u00b2 ) =676*(a -u )\n\nHmm, that's one equation.\n\nSimilarly, equation (3):\n\n[(a -x)^2 + y\u00b2][(a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 ] =900(a -x)^2\n\nBut (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 is u\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2? Wait, no, let's see.\n\nWait, (a -x)^2 is u\u00b2, and y =24 -v, so y\u00b2 = (24 -v)^2. Thus,\n\n(a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2 = u\u00b2 + 576 -48v +v\u00b2,\n\nand (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 = u\u00b2 + v\u00b2.\n\nWait, so the left side of equation (3) is [u\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2][u\u00b2 +v\u00b2].\n\nWait, hold on:\n\nWait (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2,\n\nand (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 =u\u00b2 +v\u00b2,\n\nso the product is [u\u00b2 + (24 - v)^2][u\u00b2 + v\u00b2].\n\nThen, the right side is 900 u\u00b2, since (a -x)^2 =u\u00b2.\n\nWait, equation (3):\n\n[ (u\u00b2 + (24 - v)^2 ) (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2) ] =900 u\u00b2.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo perhaps with substitutions in terms of u and v, but I don't see an immediate simplification. Maybe let me see if I can relate equations (1) and (2a) first.\n\nEquation (1 in terms of u and v):\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 -a u -48v +576 =0,\n\nEquation (2a):\n\na*( (a -u)^2 +v\u00b2 ) =676*(a -u )\n\nLet me compute (a -u)^2 +v\u00b2 = a\u00b2 -2a u +u\u00b2 +v\u00b2,\n\nSo equation (2a):\n\na*(a\u00b2 -2a u +u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 ) =676*(a -u )\n\nBut from equation (1):\n\nu\u00b2 +v\u00b2 = a u +48v -576,\n\nso substitute that into the above:\n\na*(a\u00b2 -2a u + (a u +48v -576) ) =676*(a -u )\n\nSimplify inside the brackets:\n\na\u00b2 -2a u +a u +48v -576 =a\u00b2 -a u +48v -576\n\nThus equation (2a) becomes:\n\na*(a\u00b2 -a u +48v -576 ) =676(a -u )\n\nHmm, so that's a bit complicated. Let me write that as:\n\na^3 -a\u00b2 u +48a v -576a =676a -676u\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\na^3 -a\u00b2 u +48a v -576a -676a +676u =0\n\nSimplify terms:\n\na^3 -a\u00b2 u +48a v - (576 +676)a +676u =0,\n\nwhich is:\n\na^3 -a\u00b2 u +48a v -1252a +676u =0\n\nHmm, perhaps this is too convoluted. Maybe try another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I can also consider equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x,\n\nand equation (2a): a(x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 )=676x.\n\nLet me express (24 - y)^2 as (24)^2 -48y + y\u00b2,\n\nso x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +576 -48y = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) +576 -48y = a x +576 -48y,\n\nfrom equation (1) substituted in.\n\nTherefore, equation (2a):\n\na*(a x +576 -48y ) =676x,\n\nso,\n\na^2 x +576a -48a y =676x,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\na\u00b2x -676x +576a -48a y =0,\n\nFactor x terms:\n\nx(a\u00b2 -676) + a(576 -48y)=0,\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be rearranged as:\n\nx(a\u00b2 -676) = -a(576 -48y),\n\n=> x = [ -a(576 -48y) ] / (a\u00b2 -676 )\n\nHmm, but not sure if helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express y in terms of x from equation (1):\n\nFrom equation (1), y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2,\n\nso y = sqrt(a x -x\u00b2). Wait, but that might complicate things with square roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to look at equation (3).\n\nWait, equation (3) in terms of variables u and v might be more manageable? Let me see.\n\nEquation (3) after substitution:\n\n[ u\u00b2 + (24 - v)^2 ][ u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 ] = 900 u\u00b2.\n\nWait, perhaps expanding this.\n\nFirst compute (u\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2)(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 )\n\nLet me denote A = u\u00b2, B = (24 -v)^2, so first term is A + B, second term is A + v\u00b2.\n\nWait, but perhaps expanding:\n\nMultiply (u\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2)(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 )\n\n= u^4 + u\u00b2 v\u00b2 + u\u00b2 (24 -v)^2 + (24 -v)^2 v\u00b2\n\nWait, that seems even more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps expand each term:\n\nFirst factor: u\u00b2 + (24 -v)^2 = u\u00b2 + 576 -48v +v\u00b2\n\nSecond factor: u\u00b2 +v\u00b2.\n\nMultiply them:\n\n(u\u00b2 +576 -48v +v\u00b2)(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 )\n\nLet me let S = u\u00b2 +v\u00b2,\n\nthen it becomes (S +576 -48v ) * S = S\u00b2 + (576 -48v) S\n\nSo,\n\n= S\u00b2 +576 S -48v S.\n\nBut S = u\u00b2 +v\u00b2,\n\nso substituting:\n\n= (u\u00b2 +v\u00b2)^2 +576(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2) -48v(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps let me expand term by term:\n\nMultiply (u\u00b2 +576 -48v +v\u00b2)(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2):\n\nFirst term: u\u00b2*(u\u00b2) = u^4\n\nu\u00b2*(v\u00b2) = u\u00b2 v\u00b2\n\n576*(u\u00b2) =576 u\u00b2\n\n576*v\u00b2 =576v\u00b2\n\n-48v*(u\u00b2)= -48 v u\u00b2\n\n-48v*(v\u00b2)= -48 v^3\n\nv\u00b2*(u\u00b2)=u\u00b2 v\u00b2\n\nv\u00b2*(v\u00b2)=v^4\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\nu^4 + u\u00b2 v\u00b2 +576 u\u00b2 +576 v\u00b2 -48 v u\u00b2 -48 v^3 +u\u00b2 v\u00b2 +v^4.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nu^4 + (u\u00b2 v\u00b2 + u\u00b2 v\u00b2) +576u\u00b2 +576v\u00b2 + (-48 v u\u00b2) + (-48 v^3) +v^4\n\nSimplify:\n\nu^4 + 2u\u00b2 v\u00b2 +576u\u00b2 +576v\u00b2 -48u\u00b2 v -48 v^3 +v^4.\n\nHmm, this is quite complex. Perhaps there is another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider the two equations (2a) and (3) in terms of u and v, but I'm not sure. Let me think if there's another approach.\n\nWait, perhaps note that both triangles AXD and BXC have their circumradii given. Also, since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, perhaps there are some relations between these triangles?\n\nAlternatively, since the rectangle is involved, maybe coordinate system can be leveraged better. Let me try to proceed with coordinates.\n\nLet me note that equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x,\n\nso that gives a relation between x and y.\n\nAlso, the coordinates of X are (x,y). Let me see if I can find expressions for the sides of the triangles and then apply the circumradius formulas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle AXD, which is acute, so all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so the square of each side must be less than the sum of the squares of the other two sides. But perhaps that's more constraints than we need; maybe the problem's conditions are already satisfied given the circumradius?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the problem as involving two circles: the circumcircle of triangle AXD with radius 13 and the circumcircle of triangle BXC with radius 15, and also the condition that angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so X lies on the circle with diameter AB.\n\nWait, hold on! Since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, then point X lies on the circle with diameter AB. That's a key insight.\n\nYes, in a circle with diameter AB, any point on the circle will form a right angle at that point with A and B. Since X is inside the rectangle, it must lie on the circle with diameter AB, but inside the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the locus of X is the intersection of the circle with diameter AB and the rectangle. Since the rectangle has sides AB and BC=24, the circle with diameter AB would have radius a/2, centered at the midpoint of AB, which is (a/2, 0). So the equation of that circle is (x - a/2)^2 + y^2 = (a/2)^2.\n\nExpanding that: x\u00b2 -a x + (a\u00b2)/4 + y\u00b2 = a\u00b2/4,\n\nSo simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -a x =0,\n\nwhich is exactly equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = a x. So that's consistent. So X lies on that circle.\n\nTherefore, we can use coordinates of X lying on that circle, so perhaps parametrize X on that circle.\n\nLet me parametrize X using an angle \u03b8. Let me consider the circle with diameter AB, so center at (a/2,0), radius a/2. So parametrization can be:\n\nx = (a/2)(1 + cos\u03b8),\n\ny = (a/2) sin\u03b8,\n\nsince the standard parametrization for a circle with center (h,k) and radius r is h + r cos\u03b8, k + r sin\u03b8. Here, h = a/2, k=0, r =a/2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of X can be written as:\n\nx = (a/2)(1 + cos\u03b8),\n\ny = (a/2) sin\u03b8,\n\nfor some angle \u03b8 between 0 and 2\u03c0. Since X is inside the rectangle, y must be between 0 and24, so (a/2) sin\u03b8 <24, but since a is positive, this will depend on a, but maybe we can proceed with this parametrization.\n\nLet me substitute these expressions into the equations for the circumradii.\n\nFirst, let's compute the coordinates:\n\nx = (a/2)(1 + cos\u03b8),\n\ny = (a/2) sin\u03b8.\n\nSo let me compute expressions for triangles AXD and BXC.\n\nFirst, compute for triangle AXD:\n\nVertices A(0,0), X(x,y), D(0,24).\n\nThe sides:\n\nAX: distance from A to X: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). From equation (1), this is sqrt(a x).\n\nWait, but sqrt(a x) is the length of AX? Yes, since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x, so sqrt(a x).\n\nAlternatively, since X is on the circle with diameter AB, AX is one leg, BX is the other, but since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, maybe AX and BX are perpendicular. Wait, but AX and BX are not the legs; the right angle is at X, so the hypotenuse would be AB. Indeed, AX and BX are the legs, and AB is the hypotenuse. Therefore, AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = AB\u00b2,\n\nWhich gives (a x) + ( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 ) =a\u00b2,\n\nIndeed:\n\nAX\u00b2 =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x,\n\nBX\u00b2 = (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2,\n\nso AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 = a x + (a\u00b2 - 2a x +x\u00b2 +y\u00b2) =a x +a\u00b2 -2a x + (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =a\u00b2 -a x + (a x) =a\u00b2. So that checks out.\n\nOkay, so maybe using this parametrization can help.\n\nLet me proceed with parametrizing X as:\n\nx = (a/2)(1 + cos\u03b8),\n\ny = (a/2) sin\u03b8.\n\nNow let's compute the sides of triangle AXD and BXC.\n\nFirst, triangle AXD:\n\nSides:\n\nAX: sqrt(a x). Let me compute that:\n\nAX = sqrt(a x) = sqrt( a*( (a/2)(1 + cos\u03b8) ) ) = sqrt( (a\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8) )\n\nXD: distance from X to D(0,24):\n\nsqrt( x\u00b2 + (24 - y)^2 ).\n\nPlugging in x and y:\n\nx\u00b2 = (a\u00b2/4)(1 + cos\u03b8)^2,\n\n(24 - y)^2 = (24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8))^2.\n\nThus,\n\nXD = sqrt[ (a\u00b2/4)(1 + cos\u03b8)^2 + (24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8))^2 ]\n\nAD: 24.\n\nCircumradius R1 =13. The formula R1 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4 * Area AXD). We know area AXD is 12x, which is 12*(a/2)(1 + cos\u03b8) =6a(1 + cos\u03b8).\n\nSo plugging into R1:\n\n13 = [ AX * XD *24 ] / (4 *6a(1 + cos\u03b8) )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*6a(1 + cos\u03b8)=24a(1 + cos\u03b8)\n\nThus,\n\n13 = [ AX * XD *24 ] / [24a(1 + cos\u03b8) ]\n\nCancel 24:\n\n13 = (AX * XD) / [a(1 + cos\u03b8) ]\n\nTherefore,\n\nAX * XD =13 a (1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nSimilarly, let's compute AX and XD in terms of a and \u03b8:\n\nAX = sqrt( (a\u00b2/2)(1 + cos\u03b8) ) = (a / sqrt(2)) sqrt(1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nXD is sqrt[ (a\u00b2/4)(1 + cos\u03b8)^2 + (24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8 ))^2 ]\n\nThis looks complicated, but perhaps we can square both sides of AX * XD =13a(1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nFirst, let me denote sqrt(1 + cos\u03b8) as S, so that AX = (a / sqrt(2)) S,\n\nthen AX * XD = (a / sqrt(2)) S * XD =13a(1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nBut S = sqrt(1 + cos\u03b8 ), so S\u00b2 =1 + cos\u03b8,\n\nThus,\n\n(a / sqrt(2)) * S * XD =13a S\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by a S (assuming a\u22600, S\u22600):\n\n(1/sqrt(2)) * XD =13 S,\n\nThus,\n\nXD =13 S * sqrt(2) =13 sqrt(2) * sqrt(1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nSo,\n\nXD =13 sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8 )),\n\nsince sqrt(2)*sqrt(1 + cos\u03b8 ) = sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8 )),\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nsqrt[ (a\u00b2/4)(1 + cos\u03b8)^2 + (24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8 ))^2 ] =13 sqrt(2(1 + cos\u03b8 )).\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\nLeft side squared:\n\n(a\u00b2/4)(1 + cos\u03b8)^2 + (24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8 ))^2\n\nRight side squared:\n\n169 * 2(1 + cos\u03b8 ) =338(1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nTherefore,\n\n(a\u00b2/4)(1 + cos\u03b8)^2 + (24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8 ))^2 =338(1 + cos\u03b8 )\n\nLet me expand the second term on the left:\n\n(24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8 ))^2 =24\u00b2 -24*a sin\u03b8 + (a\u00b2/4) sin\u00b2\u03b8 =576 -24a sin\u03b8 + (a\u00b2/4) sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nSo the entire left side becomes:\n\n(a\u00b2/4)(1 + cos\u03b8)^2 +576 -24a sin\u03b8 + (a\u00b2/4) sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nLet me combine the terms with a\u00b2/4:\n\na\u00b2/4 [ (1 + cos\u03b8)^2 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] +576 -24a sin\u03b8\n\nExpand (1 + cos\u03b8)^2:\n\n=1 +2cos\u03b8 +cos\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nso,\n\n(1 + cos\u03b8)^2 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1 +2cos\u03b8 +cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =2 +2cos\u03b8,\n\nsince cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nTherefore,\n\nLeft side becomes:\n\n(a\u00b2/4)(2 +2cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8 = (a\u00b2/4)*2*(1 +cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8 = (a\u00b2/2)(1 +cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n(a\u00b2/2)(1 +cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8 = 338(1 +cos\u03b8 )\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n(a\u00b2/2)(1 +cos\u03b8 ) -338(1 +cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8 =0\n\nFactor out (1 +cos\u03b8 ) from the first two terms:\n\n[ (a\u00b2/2 -338) ] (1 +cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8 =0\n\nHmm, this is still complex. Let me see if I can rearrange terms:\n\nLet me denote terms with (1 +cos\u03b8 ):\n\n( (a\u00b2/2 -338 ) (1 +cos\u03b8 ) ) + (576 -24a sin\u03b8 ) =0\n\nPerhaps I need another equation from triangle BXC.\n\nLet me attempt the same approach for triangle BXC.\n\nTriangle BXC has vertices B(a,0), X(x,y), C(a,24).\n\nCircumradius R2=15.\n\nSimilarly, Area of BXC is 12(a -x), as computed earlier.\n\nThe sides:\n\nBX: sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nXC: sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nBC:24.\n\nSo using the formula:\n\nR2= (BX * XC * BC )/(4 * Area BXC )\n\nSo,\n\n15 = [ BX * XC *24 ] / (4 *12(a -x) )\n\nSimplify denominator:48(a -x)\n\nThus,\n\n15 = [ BX * XC *24 ] / [48(a -x) ]\n\n=> 15 = [ BX * XC ] / [2(a -x) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBX * XC =30(a -x )\n\nSimilarly as before, let's parametrize using \u03b8.\n\nRecall that x = (a/2)(1 +cos\u03b8 ), so a -x =a - (a/2)(1 +cos\u03b8 )= (a/2)(1 -cos\u03b8 )\n\nAlso, y = (a/2) sin\u03b8,\n\nTherefore, compute BX and XC.\n\nFirst, BX is the distance from B(a,0) to X(x,y):\n\nBX = sqrt( (a -x)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\n= sqrt( [ (a/2)(1 -cos\u03b8) ]^2 + [ (a/2 sin\u03b8 ) ]^2 )\n\n= (a/2) sqrt( (1 -cos\u03b8 )\u00b2 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nExpand inside sqrt:\n\n(1 -2cos\u03b8 +cos\u00b2\u03b8 ) + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1 -2cos\u03b8 + (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 )=2(1 -cos\u03b8 )\n\nThus, BX = (a/2) sqrt(2(1 -cos\u03b8 ))= (a / sqrt(2)) sqrt(1 -cos\u03b8 )\n\nSimilarly, XC is the distance from X to C(a,24):\n\nXC = sqrt( (a -x)^2 + (24 - y)^2 )\n\nCompute (a -x)^2 = [ (a/2)(1 -cos\u03b8) ]^2,\n\nand (24 - y)^2 = (24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8 ))^2,\n\nso,\n\nXC= sqrt( (a\u00b2/4)(1 -cos\u03b8 )\u00b2 + (24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8 ))\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly to before, let's compute XC * BX =30(a -x )\n\nWe have:\n\nBX * XC = [ (a / sqrt(2)) sqrt(1 -cos\u03b8 ) ] * XC =30*(a/2)(1 -cos\u03b8 )\n\nThus,\n\n( a / sqrt(2) ) sqrt(1 -cos\u03b8 ) * XC =15 a (1 -cos\u03b8 )\n\nDivide both sides by a sqrt(1 -cos\u03b8 ) (assuming a \u22600, cos\u03b8 \u22601):\n\n(1/ sqrt(2)) * XC =15 sqrt(1 -cos\u03b8 )\n\nThus,\n\nXC =15 sqrt(2(1 -cos\u03b8 )),\n\nsince sqrt(2)*sqrt(1 -cos\u03b8 ) = sqrt(2(1 -cos\u03b8 )),\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\nsqrt( (a\u00b2/4)(1 -cos\u03b8 )\u00b2 + (24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8 ))\u00b2 ) =15 sqrt(2(1 -cos\u03b8 ))\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nLeft side squared:\n\n(a\u00b2/4)(1 -cos\u03b8 )\u00b2 + (24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8 ))\u00b2\n\nRight side squared:\n\n225 *2(1 -cos\u03b8 )=450(1 -cos\u03b8 )\n\nExpand the second term on the left:\n\n(24 - (a/2 sin\u03b8 ))^2 =24\u00b2 -24a sin\u03b8 + (a\u00b2/4) sin\u00b2\u03b8 =576 -24a sin\u03b8 + (a\u00b2/4) sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nThus, left side becomes:\n\n(a\u00b2/4)(1 -cos\u03b8 )\u00b2 +576 -24a sin\u03b8 + (a\u00b2/4) sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nCombine terms with a\u00b2/4:\n\na\u00b2/4 [ (1 -cos\u03b8 )\u00b2 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] +576 -24a sin\u03b8\n\nExpand (1 -cos\u03b8 )\u00b2:\n\n=1 -2cos\u03b8 +cos\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nso,\n\n(1 -cos\u03b8 )\u00b2 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1 -2cos\u03b8 +cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =2(1 -cos\u03b8 )\n\nThus,\n\nLeft side becomes:\n\n(a\u00b2/4)*2(1 -cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8 = (a\u00b2/2)(1 -cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8\n\nTherefore, equation:\n\n(a\u00b2/2)(1 -cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8 =450(1 -cos\u03b8 )\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n(a\u00b2/2)(1 -cos\u03b8 ) -450(1 -cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8 =0\n\nFactor out (1 -cos\u03b8 ):\n\n[ (a\u00b2/2 -450 ) ](1 -cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8=0\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\nFrom triangle AXD:\n\n[ (a\u00b2/2 -338 ) ](1 +cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8 =0 \u2192 Equation (4)\n\nFrom triangle BXC:\n\n[ (a\u00b2/2 -450 ) ](1 -cos\u03b8 ) +576 -24a sin\u03b8 =0 \u2192 Equation (5)\n\nSo now, we have two equations with variables a, cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8.

Let me write them again:\n\nEquation (4):\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 +C ) +576 -24a S =0 \u2192 Equation (4)\n\nEquation (5):\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 -C ) +576 -24a S =0 \u2192 Equation (5)\n\nLet me subtract equation (5) from equation (4) as before, but we already did that to get equation (6). Alternatively, let me try to solve for S from equations (4) and (5):\n\nLet me rearrange equation (4):\n\n-24a S = - (a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 +C ) -576 \u2192,\n\n24a S = (a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 +C ) +576 \u2192,\n\nSimilarly, equation (5):\n\n-24a S = - (a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 -C ) -576 \u2192,\n\n24a S = (a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 -C ) +576 \u2192,\n\nTherefore, equate the two expressions for 24a S:\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 +C ) +576 = (a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 -C ) +576,\n\nSubtract 576 from both sides:\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 +C ) = (a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 -C )\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 +C ) = (a\u00b2/2 -338) + (a\u00b2/2 -338)C,\n\nRight side: (a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 -C ) = (a\u00b2/2 -450) - (a\u00b2/2 -450)C,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338) + (a\u00b2/2 -338)C - (a\u00b2/2 -450) + (a\u00b2/2 -450)C =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n[ (a\u00b2/2 -338 -a\u00b2/2 +450) ] + [ (a\u00b2/2 -338 +a\u00b2/2 -450 ) ]C =0,\n\nCompute first bracket:\n\n(450 -338)=112,\n\nSecond bracket:\n\n(a\u00b2 - (338+450))=a\u00b2 -788,\n\nTherefore,\n\n112 + (a\u00b2 -788 )C =0,\n\nWhich is the same as equation (6). So no new information here.\n\nTherefore, to proceed, we need to use equation (6) and either equation (4) or (5), along with C\u00b2 + S\u00b2 =1.\n\nSo let's pick equation (4):\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 +C ) +576 -24a S =0,\n\nWe can express S in terms of C or vice versa. Let me use equation (6):\n\nC = -112/(a\u00b2 -788 )\n\nLet me denote D = a\u00b2,\n\nthen C = -112/(D -788 )\n\nAlso, since C\u00b2 + S\u00b2 =1,\n\nS\u00b2 =1 - C\u00b2 =1 - (112)^2/(D -788 )\u00b2,\n\nSo S = \u00b1 sqrt(1 - (12544)/(D -788 )\u00b2 )\n\nBut since X is inside the rectangle, and given the parametrization, we might need to consider the sign. Let me see:\n\nIn our parametrization, y = (a/2) sin\u03b8,\n\nand since y must be between 0 and24,\n\nsin\u03b8 must be between 0 and (48)/a,\n\nsince (a/2) sin\u03b8 <24 \u21d2 sin\u03b8 <48/a,\n\nbut since sin\u03b8 \u22641, so 48/a \u2265 sin\u03b8,\n\nso 48/a must be \u22650, which it is as a>0,\n\nso the upper limit is min(1,48/a).\n\nTherefore, depending on a, sin\u03b8 can be positive or negative? Wait, but if X is inside the rectangle, then y is between 0 and24, so sin\u03b8 must be non-negative (since y=(a/2) sin\u03b8 must be between 0 and24). Thus, sin\u03b8 is non-negative, so S = sin\u03b8 is non-negative. So S = sqrt(1 - C\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but in equation (4) and (5), would the sign matter? Let's see.\n\nAssuming S is non-negative, so S = sqrt(1 - C\u00b2 ).\n\nTherefore, proceed with that.\n\nSo, let me plug C into equation (4):\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 +C ) +576 -24a S =0,\n\nExpress everything in terms of D =a\u00b2,\n\nand C = -112/(D -788),\n\nSo,\n\n( D/2 -338 )(1 + (-112)/(D -788) ) +576 -24a sqrt(1 - [112/(D -788)]\u00b2 ) =0,\n\nThis is very complicated, but let's try to simplify step by step.\n\nFirst, compute 1 + C =1 + (-112)/(D -788 )= (D -788 -112)/(D -788 )=(D -900)/(D -788 )\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term:\n\n( D/2 -338 )*(D -900)/(D -788 )\n\nSecond term: +576,\n\nThird term: -24a sqrt(1 - (12544)/(D -788)^2 )\n\nTherefore, entire equation:\n\n( D/2 -338 )*(D -900)/(D -788 ) +576 -24a sqrt( [ (D -788)^2 -12544 ] / (D -788)^2 ) =0,\n\nSimplify the sqrt term:\n\nsqrt( [ (D -788)^2 -12544 ] / (D -788)^2 ) = sqrt( (D -788)^2 -12544 ) / |D -788|,\n\nBut since D =a\u00b2, and since X is inside the rectangle, from equation (1): x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x,\n\nsince x is between0 and a, so a x is between0 and a\u00b2,\n\nthus x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =a x \u21d2 y\u00b2 =a x -x\u00b2 =x(a -x ) which is non-negative,\n\nso a must be positive, and D =a\u00b2,\n\nbut we need to consider D -788 in denominator. Let me see if D -788 is positive or negative.\n\nAssuming D >788, then denominator D -788 is positive,\n\nso sqrt( (D -788)^2 -12544 ) / (D -788 )\n\n= sqrt( (D -788)^2 - (112)^2 ) / (D -788 )\n\n= sqrt( (D -788 -112)(D -788 +112) ) / (D -788 )\n\n= sqrt( (D -900)(D -676) ) / (D -788 )\n\nHmm, interesting. So,\n\nsqrt( (D -900)(D -676) ) / (D -788 )\n\nBut this requires that (D -900)(D -676) \u22650,\n\nso either D \u2265900 or D \u2264676.\n\nBut since D =a\u00b2, and a is the length AB, which is a side of the rectangle, so a must be positive.\n\nNow, let's see:\n\nIf D -788 is positive (i.e., D >788), then the sqrt term is real only if either D \u2265900 or D \u2264676. But D >788, so D \u2265900.\n\nAlternatively, if D <788, then D -788 is negative,\n\nthen the sqrt term would be sqrt( (D -900)(D -676) ) / (negative )\n\nBut (D -900)(D -676) would be (negative)(negative)=positive if D <676,\n\nor (D -900)(D -676)= (negative)(positive)=negative if between 676 and900,\n\nso only D \u2264676 would give positive inside sqrt,\n\nbut then D -788 would be negative,\n\nso overall,\n\nsqrt( (D -900)(D -676) ) / (D -788 ) would be sqrt( (D -900)(D -676) ) / (negative )\n\nBut then the sqrt requires (D -900)(D -676) \u22650,\n\nso either D \u2264676 or D \u2265900,\n\nso if D \u2264676,\n\nthen D -788 is negative,\n\nso the sqrt term would be sqrt( (D -900)(D -676) ) / (D -788 ) = sqrt( (positive)(negative) ) / (negative ) \u2192 which is sqrt(negative) \u2192 invalid.\n\nHence, only valid when D \u2265900,\n\nso D must be \u2265900.\n\nTherefore, proceeding with D \u2265900,\n\nso D -788 is positive,\n\nand sqrt( (D -900)(D -676) ) is real.\n\nThus, the sqrt term simplifies to sqrt( (D -900)(D -676) ) / (D -788 )\n\nTherefore, equation (4) becomes:\n\n( D/2 -338 )*(D -900)/(D -788 ) +576 -24a * [ sqrt( (D -900)(D -676) ) / (D -788 ) ] =0,\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nTerm1 + Term2 - Term3 =0,\n\nwhere:\n\nTerm1 = ( D/2 -338 )*(D -900)/(D -788 )\n\nTerm2 =576,\n\nTerm3 =24a * sqrt( (D -900)(D -676) ) / (D -788 )\n\nHmm, this is still quite complex. Maybe we can find a substitution for D.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote K = D -788,\n\nthen D =K +788,\n\nthen D -900 = K +788 -900 =K -112,\n\nD -676 = K +788 -676 =K +112,\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt( (D -900)(D -676) ) = sqrt( (K -112)(K +112) )=sqrt(K\u00b2 - (112)^2 )\n\nAlso,\n\nTerm1:\n\n( (K +788)/2 -338 )*( (K -112) ) / K,\n\nsince D/2 -338 = (K +788)/2 -338 = (K +788 -676)/2 = (K +112)/2,\n\nso,\n\nTerm1 = ( (K +112)/2 )*(K -112)/K = [ (K +112)(K -112) ]/(2K ) = (K\u00b2 - (112)^2 )/(2K )\n\nTerm2 =576,\n\nTerm3 =24a * sqrt(K\u00b2 -12544)/K,\n\nBut a = sqrt(D ) = sqrt(K +788 )\n\nThus,\n\nTerm3=24*sqrt(K +788 ) * sqrt(K\u00b2 -12544)/K,\n\nHence, putting all together:\n\nTerm1 + Term2 - Term3 =0,\n\n=> (K\u00b2 -12544)/(2K ) +576 -24 sqrt(K +788 ) sqrt(K\u00b2 -12544)/K =0,\n\nMultiply all terms by 2K to eliminate denominators:\n\n(K\u00b2 -12544) + 1152K -48 sqrt(K +788 ) sqrt(K\u00b2 -12544 ) =0,\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\n(K\u00b2 +1152K -12544 ) =48 sqrt(K +788 ) sqrt(K\u00b2 -12544 )\n\nThis still looks complicated, but let me see if we can square both sides to eliminate the square roots. However, this might introduce extraneous solutions, so we have to check later.\n\nLet me denote LHS = K\u00b2 +1152K -12544,\n\nRHS =48 sqrt( (K +788)(K\u00b2 -12544) )\n\nThus,\n\nLHS = RHS,\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\nLHS\u00b2 = (K\u00b2 +1152K -12544 )\u00b2 = 2304 (K +788)(K\u00b2 -12544 )\n\nThis is going to be a quartic equation, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me expand both sides.\n\nFirst, expand LHS:\n\nLet me write (K\u00b2 +1152K -12544 )\u00b2,\n\nLet me denote M = K\u00b2 +1152K -12544,\n\nthen M\u00b2 = (K\u00b2)^2 + (1152K)^2 + (-12544)^2 + 2*(K\u00b2)(1152K) +2*(K\u00b2)(-12544 ) +2*(1152K)(-12544 )\n\nWait, this is tedious.

=sqrt(320)*8\u221a2= (8\u221a5)(8\u221a2)=64\u221a10,\n\nBut desired is26x=26*8=208,\n\n64\u221a10 \u2248201.25\u2248208,\n\nClose but not exact.\n\nHmm,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps y=10,\n\nthen y\u00b2=100=a x -x\u00b2,\n\nLet me try a=26,\n\nthen x\u00b2-26x+100=0,\n\nDiscriminant=676-400=276,\n\nx=(26\u00b1sqrt(276))/2,\n\nNot integer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe a=

error is not working.\n\nWait but in the case above with a=26 and y=12, we obtained R1=13 and R2=13,\n\nwhich suggests that maybe the answer is a=40,\n\nwhere R1=13 and R2=15.\n\nWait let me try a=40,\n\nSuppose that AX * XD=26x,\n\nBX * XC=30*(40 -x),\n\nand AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2=1600,\n\nLet me assume that y=12,\n\nthen,\n\ny\u00b2=144=ax -x\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 -40x +144=0,\n\nSolutions x=(40\u00b1sqrt(1600-576))/2=(40\u00b1sqrt(1024))/2=(40\u00b132)/2=36 or4,\n\nIf x=4,\n\nthen,\n\nAX=sqrt(4\u00b2+12\u00b2)=sqrt(16+144)=sqrt(160)=4\u221a10,\n\nXD= sqrt(4\u00b2 + (24-12)^2 )=sqrt(16+144)=sqrt(160)=4\u221a10,\n\nThus AX * XD=160,\n\n26x=26*4=104,\n\nNot 160,\n\nNo.\n\nIf x=36,\n\nAX=sqrt(36\u00b2+12\u00b2)=sqrt(1296+144)=sqrt(1440)=12\u221a10,\n\nXD= sqrt(36\u00b2 +12\u00b2)= same as AX,\n\nThus AX * XD= (12\u221a10 )\u00b2=1440,\n\n26x=26*36=936,\n\nNot equal.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the case when a= 25,\n\nBut BC=24,\n\nWait, but BC is vertical side of rectangle,\n\nAB is horizontal side of length a,\n\nBC=24,\n\nThus rectangle dimensions are a\u00d724,\n\nThus, a can be any positive real number,\n\nBut the problem is to find a,\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is 26,\n\nBut in that case, the second circumradius is also13,\n\nBut the problem says it should be15,\n\nThus, maybe the answer is 40,\n\nWait let me try with a=40,\n\nand suppose that AX * XD=26x,\n\nBX * XC=30(40 -x),\n\nand AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2=1600,\n\nLet me assume x= 16,\n\nthen,\n\nAX\u00b2 =16\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nBX\u00b2 = (24)^2 + y\u00b2,\n\nAX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2= 256 + y\u00b2 + 576 + y\u00b2=832 +2y\u00b2=1600,\n\nThus 2y\u00b2=768 \u21d2y\u00b2=384 \u21d2y= sqrt(384)=8\u221a6\u224819.5959,\n\nThen,\n\nXD\u00b2= x\u00b2 + (24 -y )\u00b2=256 + (24 -8\u221a6 )\u00b2,\n\nCalculate (24 -8\u221a6 )\u00b2=24\u00b2 -2*24*8\u221a6 + (8\u221a6 )\u00b2=576 -384\u221a6 + 384= 960 -384\u221a6,\n\nThus XD\u00b2=256 +960 -384\u221a6=1216 -384\u221a6,\n\nThus,\n\nXD= sqrt(1216 -384\u221a6 ),\n\nAX * XD= sqrt(256 + y\u00b2 )*sqrt(1216 -384\u221a6 ),\n\nBut y\u00b2=384,\n\nAX= sqrt(256+384)=sqrt(640)=8\u221a10,\n\nThus,\n\nAX * XD=8\u221a10 * sqrt(1216 -384\u221a6 ),\n\nThis needs to equal26x=26*16=416,\n\nThis is likely not the case.\n\nAlternatively, this approach is too time-consuming.\n\nWait going back to the previous case where a=26 gave R1=13 and R2=13,\n\nPerhaps the answer is double of that, a=52,\n\nBut then,\n\nIf a=52,\n\nand y=24,\n\nbut y must be less than24,\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 48,\n\nWait let's try a= 48,\n\nand set y= 16,\n\nthen,\n\ny\u00b2=256=ax -x\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 -48x +256=0,\n\nSolution x=(48\u00b1sqrt(2304-1024))/2=(48\u00b1sqrt(1280))/2=(48\u00b18\u221a20)/2=24\u00b14\u221a5,\n\nNot rational.\n\nAlternatively, y= 8,\n\nthen,\n\ny\u00b2=64=ax -x\u00b2,\n\nx\u00b2 -48x +64=0,\n\nSolution x=(48\u00b1sqrt(2304-256))/2=(48\u00b1sqrt(2048))/2=(48\u00b132\u221a2)/2=24\u00b116\u221a2,\n\nNot rational.\n\nHmm,\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires a= 50,\n\nWait,\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equations:\n\nFrom AX * XD=26x,\n\nand BX * XC=30(a -x ),\n\nand AX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2 =a\u00b2,\n\nLet me denote m=AX,\n\nn=BX,\n\nthen,\n\nm\u00b2 +n\u00b2 =a\u00b2,\n\nm * sqrt(m\u00b2 +t )=26x,\n\nn * sqrt(n\u00b2 +t )=30(a -x ),\n\nwhere t=576-48y,\n\nand y= sqrt(ax -x\u00b2 ),\n\nThus,\n\nt=576 -48 sqrt(ax -x\u00b2 )\n\nThis system is too complex,\n\nPerhaps the answer is 26,\n\nEven though it gives R2=13,\n\nBut the problem might have a typo?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for a=40.\n\nWait let me try a= 40,\n\nSet x= 10,\n\nthen,\n\nAX\u00b2=100 + y\u00b2,\n\nBX\u00b2= (30)^2 + y\u00b2,\n\nAX\u00b2 + BX\u00b2= 100 + y\u00b2 +900 +y\u00b2=1000 +2y\u00b2=1600,\n\nThus,\n\n2y\u00b2=600 \u21d2 y\u00b2=300 \u21d2 y=10\u221a3\u224817.32,\n\nThen,\n\nt=576-48*y\u2248576-48*17.32\u2248576-831.36\u2248-255.36,\n\nThus,\n\nXD= sqrt(m\u00b2 +t )= sqrt(100+y\u00b2 +t )= sqrt(100+300 -255.36)=sqrt(144.64)=12.03,\n\nAX * XD= sqrt(400)*12.03\u224820*12.03\u2248240.6,\n\n26x=260,\n\nNot equal.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's given circumradii are swapped?\n\nIf AXD is15 and BXC is13,\n\nthen with a=26,\n\nthen R2 would be13,\n\nwhich matches,\n\nBut the problem states AXD is13 and BXC is15,\n\nThus, perhaps the answer is 26,\n\nBut then the problem says BXC's radius is15,\n\nBut in my calculation it's13,\n\nThus, likely not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is 50,\n\nWait,\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equations:\n\nFrom the two equations:\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 +C ) +576 -24a S =0,\n\nand,\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -450)(1 -C ) +576 -24a S =0,\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first,\n\nwhich gave:\n\n112 + (a\u00b2 -788 )C =0,\n\nThus,\n\nC= -112/(a\u00b2-788),\n\nNow, substituting into first equation,\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)(1 +C ) +576 -24a S =0,\n\nReplace C,\n\n(a\u00b2/2 -338)*(1 -112/(a\u00b2-788) ) +576 -24a

(D-900)/(D-788 ) ),\n\nThus,\n\n[ (D/2 -338)(D-900) ]/(D-788 ) +576 -24a S =0,\n\nMultiply through by (D-788),\n\nThen,\n\n(D/2 -338)(D-900) +576(D-788 ) -24a S (D-788 )=0,\n\nThis is still complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me set D= a\u00b2= 900 +k,\n\nthen,\n\nC= -112/k,\n\nand,\n\nS= sqrt(1 - (12544/k\u00b2 )),\n\nThus,\n\nthe first equation becomes,\n\n( ( (900 +k)/2 -338 )*(1
