      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where there's a unique triple (a, b, c) of positive real numbers that satisfies two equations. The first one is 2(a\u00b2 + 1) = 3(b\u00b2 + 1) = 4(c\u00b2 + 1), and the second one is ab + bc + ca = 1. Then I have to compute a + b + c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since all three expressions 2(a\u00b2 +1), 3(b\u00b2 +1), and 4(c\u00b2 +1) are equal, maybe I can set them equal to a common variable, like k. That way, I can express each variable in terms of k, and then substitute into the second equation. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n2(a\u00b2 + 1) = 3(b\u00b2 + 1) = 4(c\u00b2 + 1) = k.\n\nSo then, from the first part, 2(a\u00b2 +1) = k, so a\u00b2 = (k/2) - 1. Similarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = (k/3) - 1,\n\nand\n\nc\u00b2 = (k/4) - 1.\n\nSince a, b, c are positive real numbers, their squares must be non-negative. Therefore, each of these expressions must be non-negative.\n\nSo, (k/2) - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 2,\n\n(k/3) -1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 3,\n\nand (k/4) -1 \u22650 \u21d2 k \u22654.\n\nTherefore, k must be at least 4. Because the first condition requires k at least 2, but since all three have to hold, the strictest condition is k \u22654. So k is at least 4.\n\nNow, let me write a, b, c in terms of k:\n\na = sqrt( (k/2) -1 )\n\nb = sqrt( (k/3) -1 )\n\nc = sqrt( (k/4) -1 )\n\nBut since we need to find a, b, c such that ab + bc + ca = 1, maybe I can express everything in terms of k and solve for k. Then once I have k, I can compute a, b, c and sum them up.\n\nSo, let's write ab + bc + ca =1 in terms of k.\n\nFirst, compute each product:\n\nab = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) )\n\nSimilarly, bc = sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) )\n\nand ca = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1) )\n\nHmm, that looks complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set variables in terms of some substitution, maybe set x = a, y = b, z = c, but not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe introduce variables for the terms inside the square roots. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such that:\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set 2(a\u00b2 +1) = 3(b\u00b2 +1) = 4(c\u00b2 +1) = k. Then, as above, express each variable in terms of k. Then plug into the equation ab + bc + ca = 1.\n\nBut the problem is that the products involve square roots, so maybe squaring both sides? But that might get messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables to simplify the equations. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables u, v, w such that:\n\nLet\u2019s see, let me let\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s set 2(a\u00b2 +1) = k, so a\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)\n\nSimilarly, 3(b\u00b2 +1) =k, so b\u00b2 = (k/3 -1)\n\nand 4(c\u00b2 +1)=k, so c\u00b2 = (k/4 -1)\n\nTherefore, a = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ), etc.\n\nSo, the equation ab + bc + ca =1 is in terms of k. Let me write that equation:\n\nsqrt( (k/2 -1) * (k/3 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/3 -1)*(k/4 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/2 -1)*(k/4 -1) ) =1.\n\nHmm, this seems quite complicated. Maybe there is a substitution that can make this manageable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is symmetry or substitution that can be applied here. Since all three variables are expressed in terms of k, maybe we can set variables in terms of a common variable. Let me think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that a, b, c are proportional to 2, 3, 4 or something. Wait, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps set t = sqrt(k). Not sure. Alternatively, maybe express each variable in terms of k and then substitute into the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution variables. Let me try to denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the terms inside the square roots as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s denote A = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ), B = sqrt( (k/3 -1) ), C = sqrt( (k/4 -1) ). Then the equation becomes AB + BC + CA =1. Wait, but that's exactly the equation given. So that substitution doesn't help much. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such that:\n\nLet me think of variables like x = a^2, y = b^2, z = c^2. Then the first equations become:\n\n2(x +1) = 3(y +1) =4(z +1)=k.\n\nThen, we can express x, y, z in terms of k:\n\nx = (k/2) -1,\n\ny = (k/3) -1,\n\nz = (k/4) -1.\n\nThen the second equation is ab + bc + ca =1. However, since a=sqrt(x), etc., so ab = sqrt(x y), etc.\n\nThus, the equation is sqrt(x y) + sqrt(y z) + sqrt(z x) =1.\n\nHmm, same as before. So, maybe this approach is not simplifying.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers or some optimization method? Since we have two equations and three variables, but the problem states there is a unique solution. Maybe set up a system of equations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps make a substitution for variables to reduce the number of variables. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the first equation as three separate equations:\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1) = 3(b\u00b2 +1),\n\nand 3(b\u00b2 +1) =4(c\u00b2 +1),\n\nand 2(a\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1).\n\nBut perhaps this is redundant. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express all variables in terms of one variable. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose I let\u2019s pick a variable, say a, and express b and c in terms of a.\n\nFrom the first equation, 2(a\u00b2 +1) = 3(b\u00b2 +1). So solving for b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 = (2(a\u00b2 +1))/3 -1 = (2a\u00b2 + 2)/3 -1 = (2a\u00b2 +2 -3)/3 = (2a\u00b2 -1)/3\n\nSimilarly, 2(a\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1). So,\n\nc\u00b2 = (2(a\u00b2 +1))/4 -1 = (a\u00b2 +1)/2 -1 = (a\u00b2 +1 -2)/2 = (a\u00b2 -1)/2\n\nTherefore, we can write b and c in terms of a:\n\nb = sqrt( (2a\u00b2 -1)/3 )\n\nc = sqrt( (a\u00b2 -1)/2 )\n\nNow, substitute these expressions into the second equation: ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nSo, let me write that:\n\na*b + b*c + c*a =1\n\nSubstituting b and c:\n\na * sqrt( (2a\u00b2 -1)/3 ) + sqrt( (2a\u00b2 -1)/3 ) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 -1)/2 ) + sqrt( (a\u00b2 -1)/2 ) * a =1\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated, but maybe manageable? Let me denote some terms to simplify.\n\nLet me set t = a\u00b2. Since a is a positive real number, t is positive. Also, from the expressions for b and c, we must have:\n\nFor b to be real: 2a\u00b2 -1 \u22650 \u21d2 2t -1 \u22650 \u21d2 t \u22651/2,\n\nand for c to be real: a\u00b2 -1 \u22650 \u21d2 t \u22651.\n\nTherefore, combining these, we have t \u22651.\n\nTherefore, t must be at least 1.\n\nSo, let's let t = a\u00b2, so a = sqrt(t). Then:\n\nb = sqrt( (2t -1)/3 )\n\nc = sqrt( (t -1)/2 )\n\nTherefore, substituting into the equation:\n\na*b = sqrt(t) * sqrt( (2t -1)/3 ) = sqrt( t*(2t -1)/3 )\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb*c = sqrt( (2t -1)/3 ) * sqrt( (t -1)/2 ) = sqrt( (2t -1)(t -1)/(6) )\n\nand\n\nc*a = sqrt( (t -1)/2 ) * sqrt(t) = sqrt( t(t -1)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( t*(2t -1)/3 ) + sqrt( (2t -1)(t -1)/6 ) + sqrt( t(t -1)/2 ) =1.\n\nThis seems very complicated, but maybe we can square both sides to eliminate some radicals. Although squaring might lead to more terms, but perhaps with careful steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let\u2019s set variables to simplify further. Let me denote s = sqrt(t). Then t = s\u00b2. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let\u2019s set u = t -1, so that since t \u22651, u \u22650. Let me see:\n\nLet\u2019s set u = t -1 \u21d2 t = u +1, so that:\n\nThen:\n\nFirst term inside the first radical:\n\nt*(2t -1)/3 = (u +1)(2(u +1) -1)/3 = (u +1)(2u +2 -1)/3 = (u +1)(2u +1)/3.\n\nSecond term:\n\n(2t -1)(t -1)/6 = (2(u +1) -1)(u)/6 = (2u +2 -1)(u)/6 = (2u +1)u/6.\n\nThird term:\n\nt(t -1)/2 = (u +1)u/2.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( (u +1)(2u +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (2u +1)u /6 ) + sqrt( (u +1)u /2 ) =1.\n\nHmm, maybe this substitution helps. Let me see if I can factor something out.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me denote v = sqrt(u), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try plugging in some values for u to see if we can find a solution. Since the problem states there is a unique solution, perhaps the equation has only one solution for u. Let me try u=1.\n\nLet me test u=1:\n\nFirst term sqrt( (2)(3)/3 ) = sqrt(2) \u22481.414\n\nSecond term sqrt( (3)(1)/6 ) = sqrt(0.5) \u22480.707\n\nThird term sqrt( (2)(1)/2 ) = sqrt(1)=1\n\nTotal: \u22481.414+0.707+1\u22483.121, which is way bigger than 1. Not good.\n\nHmm, maybe u=0. Let's see u=0:\n\nFirst term sqrt(1*1 /3 ) = sqrt(1/3) \u22480.577,\n\nSecond term sqrt( (1)(0)/6 ) =0,\n\nThird term sqrt(1*0 /2)=0,\n\nTotal \u22480.577 \u22601.\n\nHmm, too small. So between u=0 and u=1, the value goes from ~0.577 to ~3.1. Since we need it to be 1, maybe somewhere in between.\n\nAlternatively, u=0.5:\n\nThen,\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (1.5)(2*0.5 +1)/3 ) = sqrt(1.5*(2)/3)= sqrt( (3)/3 ) =1,\n\nSecond term: sqrt( (2*0.5 +1)*0.5 /6 ) = sqrt( (2*0.5=1, so 1+1=2? Wait, 2*0.5 is 1, plus 1? Wait, 2u +1 where u=0.5 is 2*(0.5)+1=2. So (2u+1)*u =2*0.5=1? Wait:\n\nWait, second term is sqrt( (2u+1)*u /6 ). With u=0.5,\n\n(2*0.5 +1)*0.5 = (1 +1)*0.5 =2*0.5=1. So sqrt(1/6)= ~0.408,\n\nThird term sqrt( (u+1)*u /2 ) = sqrt( (1.5)*0.5 /2 ) = sqrt(0.75/2)=sqrt(0.375)=~0.612\n\nTotal: 1 +0.408 +0.612\u22482.02, still more than 1.\n\nHmm, so perhaps u less than 0.5?\n\nWait, when u=0.25,\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (0.25+1)(2*0.25 +1)/3 )\n\n= sqrt(1.25*(0.5 +1)/3? Wait, no:\n\nWait, t = u+1 =1.25, so 2t -1=2*1.25 -1=2.5 -1=1.5,\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nFirst term sqrt( (u +1)(2u +1)/3 ):\n\nu=0.25,\n\n(u+1)=1.25,\n\n2u +1=0.5 +1=1.5,\n\nso 1.25*1.5=1.875,\n\ndivided by 3: ~0.625,\n\nsqrt(0.625)=~0.7906\n\nSecond term sqrt( (2u+1)*u /6 )\n\n(2u+1)=1.5, u=0.25,\n\nso 1.5*0.25=0.375,\n\ndivided by6: ~0.0625,\n\nsqrt(0.0625)=0.25,\n\nThird term sqrt( (u +1)*u /2 )\n\n(u+1)=1.25, u=0.25,\n\nso 1.25*0.25=0.3125,\n\ndivided by2: 0.15625,\n\nsqrt(0.15625)=0.395\n\nTotal approx: 0.7906 +0.25 +0.395\u22481.435, still more than 1.\n\nHmm, so maybe even lower u?\n\nWait, but u has to be at least 0 (since t=a\u00b2\u22651, so u =t -1 \u22650). Maybe u=0.1:\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (1.1)(2*0.1 +1)/3 )\n\n2*0.1 is 0.2, so 0.2 +1=1.2,\n\nso 1.1*1.2=1.32,\n\ndivided by3 \u22480.44,\n\nsqrt(0.44)=~0.663,\n\nSecond term: (2u+1)*u = (1.2)*(0.1)=0.12,\n\ndivided by6: 0.02,\n\nsqrt(0.02)=~0.141,\n\nThird term sqrt( (1.1)(0.1)/2 )= sqrt(0.11/2)=sqrt(0.055)=~0.234\n\nTotal: ~0.663+0.141+0.234\u22481.038. Close to 1. So maybe around u=0.1?\n\nWait, that's very close to 1. Let me try u=0.09:\n\nFirst term: u+1=1.09, 2u+1=1.18,\n\nso 1.09*1.18\u22481.2862,\n\ndivided by3\u22480.4287,\n\nsqrt\u22480.6548,\n\nSecond term: (1.18)(0.09)=0.1062,\n\ndivided by6\u22480.0177,\n\nsqrt\u22480.133,\n\nThird term: sqrt( (1.09)(0.09)/2 ) = sqrt(0.0981/2)=sqrt(0.04905)=~0.2215,\n\nTotal\u22480.6548+0.133+0.2215\u22481.009. Very close to 1.\n\nHmm, so maybe u\u22480.09? Let me try u=0.095:\n\nFirst term: u+1=1.095,\n\n2u+1=1.19,\n\nso product:1.095*1.19\u22481.299,\n\ndivided by3\u22480.433,\n\nsqrt\u22480.658,\n\nSecond term: (1.19)(0.095)=0.11305,\n\ndivided by6\u22480.01884,\n\nsqrt\u22480.1373,\n\nThird term: sqrt( (1.095)(0.095)/2 )=sqrt(0.104/2)=sqrt(0.052)=\u22480.228,\n\nTotal\u22480.658+0.137+0.228\u22481.023. Hmm, overshoot?\n\nWait, but at u=0.09, total is ~1.009, which is just over 1. At u=0.08:\n\nFirst term:\n\nu+1=1.08,\n\n2u+1=1.16,\n\nproduct 1.08*1.16\u22481.2528,\n\ndivided by3\u22480.4176,\n\nsqrt\u22480.646,\n\nSecond term: (1.16)(0.08)=0.0928,\n\ndivided by6\u22480.0155,\n\nsqrt\u22480.124,\n\nThird term: sqrt( (1.08)(0.08)/2 )= sqrt(0.0864/2)=sqrt(0.0432)=\u22480.208,\n\nTotal\u22480.646+0.124+0.208\u22480.978. Hmm, so at u=0.08, total is ~0.978, which is less than 1.\n\nTherefore, the solution is between u=0.08 and u=0.09. Since the problem states that there is a unique solution, perhaps it is a rational number. Alternatively, maybe there is a smarter substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set x = sqrt(u), but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps consider that the equation might have a solution where variables are fractions. Wait, perhaps the answer is a simple fraction, so maybe the value of u is 1/9? Let me try u=1/9\u22480.111.\n\nWait:\n\nFirst term: u=1/9,\n\nthen u+1=10/9,\n\n2u +1=2*(1/9)+1=2/9 +1=11/9,\n\nso first term sqrt( (10/9)(11/9)/3 )= sqrt( (110)/(81*3) )= sqrt(110/243)=sqrt(\u22480.4527)=\u22480.673,\n\nSecond term sqrt( (11/9)(1/9)/6 )= sqrt(11/(81*6))= sqrt(11/486)=\u2248sqrt(0.0226)=\u22480.150,\n\nThird term sqrt( (10/9)(1/9)/2 )= sqrt(10/(81*2))= sqrt(5/81)=\u22480.249,\n\nTotal\u22480.673+0.150+0.249\u22481.072. Hmm, still higher.\n\nWait, maybe u=0.1:\n\nWait, we did u=0.1 earlier and got ~1.038. Hmm, but the problem states a unique solution. Maybe there's an exact value here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that maybe when I set variables in terms of k, perhaps I can set variables x = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ), y = sqrt( (k/3 -1) ), z = sqrt( (k/4 -1) ). Then the equation is x y + y z + z x =1, and we also have:\n\nx\u00b2 = (k/2 -1),\n\ny\u00b2 = (k/3 -1),\n\nz\u00b2 = (k/4 -1).\n\nTherefore, maybe we can write the equations as:\n\nx\u00b2 = (k/2 -1),\n\ny\u00b2 = (k/3 -1),\n\nz\u00b2 = (k/4 -1),\n\nand x y + y z + z x =1.\n\nNow, perhaps we can write k in terms of x, y, z:\n\nFrom the first equation,\n\nk=2(x\u00b2 +1),\n\nand also,\n\nk=3(y\u00b2 +1),\n\nso 2(x\u00b2 +1)=3(y\u00b2 +1),\n\nand similarly,\n\n2(x\u00b2 +1)=4(z\u00b2 +1).\n\nTherefore:\n\nFrom 2(x\u00b2 +1)=3(y\u00b2 +1),\n\n2x\u00b2 +2 =3 y\u00b2 +3,\n\nso 2x\u00b2 -3y\u00b2 =1,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2(x\u00b2 +1)=4(z\u00b2 +1),\n\nso 2x\u00b2 +2 =4z\u00b2 +4,\n\nso 2x\u00b2 -4 z\u00b2 =2 \u21d2 x\u00b2 -2 z\u00b2=1.\n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1) 2x\u00b2 -3 y\u00b2 =1,\n\n2) x\u00b2 -2 z\u00b2=1,\n\nand also, the equation x y + y z + z x =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express variables in terms of others?\n\nLet me see equation 2: x\u00b2 =1 +2 z\u00b2,\n\nso substituting into equation 1:\n\n2*(1 +2 z\u00b2) -3 y\u00b2=1,\n\n2 +4 z\u00b2 -3 y\u00b2 =1,\n\nso 4 z\u00b2 -3 y\u00b2= -1,\n\nThus, 4 z\u00b2 +1=3 y\u00b2,\n\nso y\u00b2=(4 z\u00b2 +1)/3,\n\nand from equation 2, x\u00b2=1 +2 z\u00b2.\n\nNow, let me write all variables in terms of z.\n\nSo, let\u2019s let\u2019s set z as a variable, then:\n\ny= sqrt( (4 z\u00b2 +1)/3 ),\n\nx= sqrt(1 +2 z\u00b2),\n\nand we have to plug into the equation x y + y z + z x =1.\n\nSo, substituting x and y in terms of z,\n\nFirst, x = sqrt(2 z\u00b2 +1),\n\ny = sqrt( (4 z\u00b2 +1)/3 ),\n\nThus,\n\nx y = sqrt(2 z\u00b2 +1) * sqrt( (4 z\u00b2 +1)/3 ) = sqrt( (2 z\u00b2 +1)(4 z\u00b2 +1)/3 )\n\nSimilarly,\n\ny z = sqrt( (4 z\u00b2 +1)/3 ) * z = z * sqrt( (4 z\u00b2 +1)/3 )\n\nand\n\nz x = z * sqrt(2 z\u00b2 +1 )\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( (2 z\u00b2 +1)(4 z\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + z * sqrt( (4 z\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + z * sqrt(2 z\u00b2 +1 ) =1\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated, but maybe there is a substitution here. Let me let\u2019s set w = z\u00b2. Since z is a positive real, w is also positive.

Wait, no, actually, in the substitution above, when I set w = z\u00b2, and then t = sqrt(w). Wait, this might be getting too convoluted. Maybe I need to try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that a, b, c are rational numbers, leading to k being a multiple that allows square roots to be rational, but that may not necessarily be the case.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the problem states the triple is unique.

Alternatively, perhaps set variables such that a = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ), and express b and c in terms of a, then substitute into the equation.\n\nWait, going back to the original substitution where I expressed b and c in terms of a:\n\nWe had:\n\nb = sqrt( (2a\u00b2 -1)/3 )\n\nc = sqrt( (a\u00b2 -1)/2 )\n\nAnd the equation is ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nLet me denote a as variable. Let me set a = sqrt(1 + t), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set a\u00b2 =1 + x, so that c's expression becomes sqrt(x/2). Let me try:\n\nLet\u2019s set a\u00b2 =1 +x \u21d2 c = sqrt( (a\u00b2 -1)/2 )=sqrt(x/2).\n\nAlso, then b\u00b2=(2a\u00b2 -1)/3 = (2(1+x) -1)/3 = (2+2x -1)/3=(1+2x)/3 \u21d2 b= sqrt( (1+2x)/3 ).\n\nThus, variables expressed in terms of x:\n\na= sqrt(1 +x),\n\nb= sqrt( (1+2x)/3 ),\n\nc= sqrt( x/2 )\n\nNow, the equation ab + bc + ca =1 can be written in terms of x.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nab = sqrt(1+x) * sqrt( (1+2x)/3 ) = sqrt( (1+x)(1+2x)/3 )\n\nbc = sqrt( (1+2x)/3 ) * sqrt(x/2 ) = sqrt( (1+2x)x /6 )\n\nca = sqrt(1+x) * sqrt(x/2 ) = sqrt( x(1+x)/2 )\n\nThus, equation:\n\nsqrt( (1+x)(1+2x)/3 ) + sqrt( (1+2x)x /6 ) + sqrt( x(1+x)/2 ) =1.\n\nHmm, still complicated, but perhaps substituting y = sqrt(x), so that x = y\u00b2. Let me try:\n\nLet\u2019s set y = sqrt(x) \u21d2 x = y\u00b2,\n\nthen,\n\nFirst term:\n\nsqrt( (1+y\u00b2)(1+2y\u00b2)/3 )\n\nSecond term:\n\nsqrt( (1+2y\u00b2)y\u00b2 /6 ) = y*sqrt( (1+2y\u00b2)/6 )\n\nThird term:\n\nsqrt( y\u00b2(1+y\u00b2)/2 ) = y*sqrt( (1+y\u00b2)/2 )\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( (1+y\u00b2)(1+2y\u00b2)/3 ) + y*sqrt( (1+2y\u00b2)/6 ) + y*sqrt( (1+y\u00b2)/2 ) =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps this substitution helps?

So very close to 1. So perhaps the exact solution is at y=0.3, which would mean x=y\u00b2=0.09,\n\nThus, x=0.09,\n\nthen,\n\na= sqrt(1+x)=sqrt(1.09)=\u22481.044,\n\nb= sqrt( (1+2x)/3 )=sqrt( (1+0.18)/3 )=sqrt(1.18/3)=sqrt(0.393)=\u22480.627,\n\nc= sqrt(x/2)=sqrt(0.045)=\u22480.212,\n\nThen a+b+c\u22481.044+0.627+0.212\u22481.883,\n\nBut the problem says to compute a+b+c, but the answer might be a fraction. Perhaps exact value?\n\nWait, if x=0.09=9/100,\n\nThen,\n\nLet me see,\n\nx=9/100,\n\nso,\n\na= sqrt(1 +9/100)=sqrt(109/100)=sqrt(109)/10\u2248,\n\nb= sqrt( (1+2*(9/100))/3 )=sqrt( (1 + 18/100)/3 )=sqrt(118/100 /3)=sqrt(118/300)=sqrt(59/150)=sqrt(59)/(sqrt(150)),\n\nHmm, messy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value of y is 3/10, leading to a+b+c as sqrt(1 + (9/100)) + sqrt( (1 + 18/100)/3 ) + sqrt( (9/100)/2 )\n\nCompute exactly:\n\na = sqrt(1.09) = sqrt(109)/10 \u2248 sqrt(109)/10,\n\nb = sqrt( (118)/300 ) = sqrt(59/150),\n\nc= sqrt(9/200)= 3/(10\u221a2),\n\nBut this might not simplify nicely. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects an answer of sqrt(2)+sqrt(3)+something, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an exact solution where m=0.2, which was close to 1.038. Wait, but the problem states that the triple is unique, so there must be an exact value. Maybe I made a mistake in my earlier steps.\n\nWait, going back to the equation in terms of k:\n\nWe had expressions for a, b, c in terms of k, and the equation ab + bc + ca =1. Maybe I can set variables as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s set a = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ),\n\nb = sqrt( (k/3 -1) ),\n\nc = sqrt( (k/4 -1) )\n\nThen, the equation is:\n\na b + b c + c a =1.\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n(a b + b c + c a)^2 =1,\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2 + 2 a b\u00b2 c + 2 a\u00b2 b c + 2 a b c\u00b2 =1,\n\nWait, no, actually:\n\nThe expansion is:\n\n(ab)^2 + (bc)^2 + (ca)^2 + 2ab*bc + 2ab*ca + 2bc*ca =1,\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2 + 2a b\u00b2c + 2a\u00b2 b c + 2 a b c\u00b2 =1,\n\nHmm, this seems even more complicated. Maybe instead of squaring directly, first group terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me write the equation as (a b + b c + c a)^2 =1,\n\nWhich is:\n\n(ab + bc + ca)^2 =1,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2 + 2abc(a + b + c) =1,\n\nHmm, perhaps that's better.\n\nLet me note that terms:\n\na\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2,\n\nand 2abc(a + b + c).\n\nBut I still need expressions in terms of k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2 in terms of k:\n\nFrom earlier,\n\na\u00b2 = (k/2 -1),\n\nb\u00b2 = (k/3 -1),\n\nc\u00b2 = (k/4 -1).\n\nSo,\n\na\u00b2b\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1),\n\nb\u00b2c\u00b2 = (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1),\n\nc\u00b2a\u00b2 = (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1).\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2 = [(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) + (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) + (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)].\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) = (k\u00b2/6 - k/2 -k/3 +1) = k\u00b2/6 - (3k/6 +2k/6) +1 =k\u00b2/6 -5k/6 +1,\n\nSecond term: (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)=k\u00b2/12 -k/3 -k/4 +1= k\u00b2/12 - (4k/12 +3k/12)+1= k\u00b2/12 -7k/12 +1,\n\nThird term: (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)=k\u00b2/8 -k/4 -k/2 +1= k\u00b2/8 -3k/4 +1,\n\nAdding all three terms:\n\nFirst term: k\u00b2/6 -5k/6 +1,\n\nSecond term: k\u00b2/12 -7k/12 +1,\n\nThird term:k\u00b2/8 -3k/4 +1,\n\nTotal:\n\nk\u00b2 terms: (1/6 +1/12 +1/8),\n\nk terms: (-5/6 -7/12 -3/4),\n\nconstants: 1+1+1=3,\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nFor k\u00b2:\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n1/6 =4/24,\n\n1/12=2/24,\n\n1/8=3/24,\n\nTotal:4+2+3=9 \u21d29/24=3/8,\n\nFor k terms:\n\n-5/6 -7/12 -3/4,\n\nConvert to 12 denominator:\n\n-10/12 -7/12 -9/12= -26/12= -13/6,\n\nSo,\n\nTotal expression:\n\n(3k\u00b2)/8 - (13k)/6 +3.\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2 = (3k\u00b2)/8 - (13k)/6 +3.\n\nNow, the other term in the squared equation is 2abc(a + b + c).\n\nWe need to compute 2abc(a + b + c).\n\nFirst, compute abc:\n\na = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ),\n\nb= sqrt( (k/3 -1) ),\n\nc= sqrt( (k/4 -1) ),\n\nThus,\n\nabc = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ).\n\nLet me denote this as sqrt(P), where P=(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1).\n\nThus, 2abc(a + b + c)=2*sqrt(P)*(a + b + c).\n\nThis is still complicated, but maybe we can write the entire equation as:\n\n(3k\u00b2)/8 - (13k)/6 +3 + 2*sqrt(P)*(a + b + c) =1,\n\nThus,\n\n2*sqrt(P)*(a + b + c)=1 - [ (3k\u00b2)/8 - (13k)/6 +3 ] = - (3k\u00b2)/8 + (13k)/6 -2.\n\nHmm, but I still have variables a and k here. Not helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that a + b + c is the value we need to find, let's call it S.\n\nThen,\n\n2*sqrt(P)*S = - (3k\u00b2)/8 + (13k)/6 -2,\n\nSo,\n\nS = [ - (3k\u00b2)/8 + (13k)/6 -2 ] / (2*sqrt(P) )\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, this seems to be getting too involved. Maybe try to consider the original problem's uniqueness. Perhaps the values of a,b,c are such that the equations can be solved by assuming that the variables are in arithmetic progression or geometric? Alternatively, maybe the minimal case where a,b,c are related to each other.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the equations are 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set 2(a\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\n3(b\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\n4(c\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 = (k-2)/2,\n\nb\u00b2=(k-3)/3,\n\nc\u00b2=(k-4)/4,\n\nNow, ab + bc + ca =1,\n\nLet me consider using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality on ab + bc + ca,\n\nBut since the problem states that there is a unique solution, perhaps the equations are set so that equality holds in some inequality, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of variables as vectors or something.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that a, b, c are proportional to 2,3,4? Let me test:\n\nSuppose a=2m, b=3m, c=4m,\n\nThen,\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1)=2*(4m\u00b2 +1),\n\n3(b\u00b2 +1)=3*(9m\u00b2 +1),\n\n4(c\u00b2 +1)=4*(16m\u00b2 +1),\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n2*(4m\u00b2+1)=3*(9m\u00b2+1)=4*(16m\u00b2+1),\n\nFirst, set 2*(4m\u00b2+1)=3*(9m\u00b2+1):\n\n8m\u00b2 +2 =27m\u00b2 +3,\n\n-19m\u00b2=1 \u21d2 m\u00b2= -1/19, impossible.\n\nNot valid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a, b, c are in geometric progression? Suppose b\u00b2 = a c,\n\nThen,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such that a = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ),\n\nand set variables in terms of trigonometric functions?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the equations are similar to Pythagorean triples but with different coefficients.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can set k=4, which is the minimal possible value.\n\nLet me try k=4,\n\nThen,\n\na\u00b2=(4/2 -1)=2-1=1 \u21d2 a=1,\n\nb\u00b2=(4/3 -1)=1/3 \u21d2 b=1/\u221a3\u22480.577,\n\nc\u00b2=(4/4 -1)=0 \u21d2 c=0,\n\nBut then c=0, which is not positive, so invalid.\n\nk=5,\n\na\u00b2= (5/2 -1)=1.5 \u21d2 a\u22481.2247,\n\nb\u00b2=(5/3 -1)=2/3\u21d2b\u22480.816,\n\nc\u00b2=(5/4 -1)=1/4\u21d2c=0.5,\n\nThen, ab + bc + ca\u22481.2247*0.816 +0.816*0.5 +0.5*1.2247\u22481.000 +0.408 +0.612\u22482.02, which is over 1.\n\nk=6,\n\na\u00b2=3-1=2 \u21d2a\u22481.414,\n\nb\u00b2=2-1=1 \u21d2b=1,\n\nc\u00b2=1.5-1=0.5 \u21d2c\u22480.707,\n\nab + bc + ca=1.414*1 +1*0.707 +0.707*1.414\u22481.414 +0.707 +1\u22483.121>1,\n\nk=3,\n\nBut k must be at least4, so invalid.\n\nk= 2.5,\n\na\u00b2= (2.5/2 -1)=0.25 \u21d2a=0.5,\n\nb\u00b2=(2.5/3 -1)= negative, invalid.\n\nHmm,\n\nWait, perhaps k= 6. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is sqrt(2)+sqrt(3)+sqrt(4) but that is irrational, but the problem says to put in boxed notation. Alternatively, maybe a+b+c is sqrt(2)+sqrt(3)+1, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the answer from the approximate calculation earlier where a\u22481.044, b\u22480.627, c\u22480.212, so sum\u22481.883, which is approximately 1.883. The problem says to put the answer in exact form. Maybe sqrt(2)+ something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value of m is 1/25?

v\u00b2 = (k/2 -1) - (k/3 -1) =k/2 -k/3 =k/6,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nv\u00b2 -w\u00b2 = (k/3 -1)-(k/4 -1)=k/3 -k/4=k/12,\n\nAnd,\n\nu\u00b2 -w\u00b2 =k/2 -k/4=k/4,\n\nThus,\n\nu\u00b2 =v\u00b2 +k/6,\n\nv\u00b2 =w\u00b2 +k/12,\n\nSo,\n\nu\u00b2 =w\u00b2 +k/12 +k/6=w\u00b2 +k/4,\n\nWhich matches the earlier equation.\n\nHmm, but how to use this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables so that u, v, w are in a geometric progression or something.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the problem requires a unique solution, so maybe the equation in k has only one solution, so perhaps through substitution, we can find k.\n\nLet me consider the equation:\n\nsqrt( (k-2)(k-3)/6 ) + sqrt( (k-3)(k-4)/12 ) + sqrt( (k-2)(k-4)/8 ) =1.\n\nLet me denote m =k-4,\n\nthen,\n\nk = m+4,\n\nThus,\n\nk-2 = m+2,\n\nk-3 = m+1,\n\nk-4 =m,\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (m+2)(m+1)/6 ),\n\nSecond term:sqrt( (m+1)m/12 ),\n\nThird term: sqrt( (m+2)m/8 ),\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( (m+2)(m+1)/6 ) + sqrt( m(m+1)/12 ) + sqrt( m(m+2)/8 ) =1.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by sqrt(24) to rationalize denominators,\n\nsqrt(24)*sqrt( (m+2)(m+1)/6 ) + sqrt(24)*sqrt( m(m+1)/12 ) + sqrt(24)*sqrt( m(m+2)/8 ) = sqrt(24),\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: sqrt(24*(m+2)(m+1)/6 )=sqrt(4*(m+2)(m+1)),\n\nSecond term: sqrt(24*m(m+1)/12)=sqrt(2*m(m+1)),\n\nThird term:sqrt(24*m(m+2)/8)=sqrt(3*m(m+2)),\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(4(m+2)(m+1)) + sqrt(2m(m+1)) + sqrt(3m(m+2)) = sqrt(24).\n\nSimplify sqrt(4(...)) =2*sqrt((m+2)(m+1)),\n\nThus,\n\n2*sqrt((m+2)(m+1)) + sqrt(2m(m+1)) + sqrt(3m(m+2)) = 2*sqrt(6).\n\nHmm, still complex, but maybe set m=1,\n\nThen,\n\n2*sqrt(3*2)=2*sqrt(6)=2*2.449\u22484.898,\n\nsqrt(2*1*2)=sqrt(4)=2,\n\nsqrt(3*1*3)=sqrt(9)=3,\n\nTotal:4.898+2+3\u22489.898>2.449,\n\nNot good.\n\nm=0.25,\n\nFirst term:2*sqrt(2.25*1.25)=2*sqrt(2.8125)=2*1.677\u22483.354,\n\nSecond term:sqrt(2*0.25*1.25)=sqrt(0.625)=0.7906,\n\nThird term:sqrt(3*0.25*2.25)=sqrt(1.6875)=1.299,\n\nTotal\u22483.354+0.7906+1.299\u22485.44>2.449,\n\nHmm, m=0.09,\n\nWait, m=0.09,\n\nFirst term:2*sqrt(2.09*1.09)=2*sqrt(2.288)=2*1.513\u22483.026,\n\nSecond term:sqrt(2*0.09*1.09)=sqrt(0.195)=0.441,\n\nThird term:sqrt(3*0.09*2.09)=sqrt(0.565)=0.752,\n\nTotal\u22483.026+0.441+0.752\u22484.219>2.449,\n\nHmm, not working.\n\nWait, the equation after substitution is:\n\n2*sqrt((m+2)(m+1)) + sqrt(2m(m+1)) + sqrt(3m(m+2)) = 2*sqrt(6).\n\nPerhaps this can be solved by assuming m is such that terms can be combined?\n\nSuppose m=2,\n\nthen,\n\n2*sqrt(4*3)=2*sqrt(12)=2*3.464\u22486.928,\n\nsqrt(2*2*3)=sqrt(12)=3.464,\n\nsqrt(3*2*4)=sqrt(24)=4.899,\n\nTotal\u22486.928+3.464+4.899\u224815.29>2\u221a6\u22484.899,\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, maybe m=0.5,\n\nFirst term:2*sqrt(2.5*1.5)=2*sqrt(3.75)=2*1.936\u22483.872,\n\nSecond term:sqrt(2*0.5*1.5)=sqrt(1.5)=1.225,\n\nThird term:sqrt(3*0.5*2.5)=sqrt(3.75)=1.936,\n\nTotal\u22483.872+1.225+1.936\u22487.033>4.899,\n\nHmm, not good.\n\nAlternatively, m= -1, but then variables are imaginary.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is not working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that when you set the three equations equal to k, and then use the equation ab+bc+ca=1,\n\nthen the solution gives a +b +c = sqrt(2) + sqrt(3) +1, but I need to verify.\n\nAlternatively, let me think differently.

term:sqrt(1*3/8)=sqrt(3/8)=\u22480.612,\n\nTotal\u22482.02,\n\nAs before.\n\nHmm, perhaps the equation can be squared twice to eliminate the square roots, but this would be very involved.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that the solution is when terms are proportional.\n\nSuppose the three terms are in proportion to 1:1:1,\n\nThen,\n\nsqrt( (k-2)(k-3)/6 ) = sqrt( (k-3)(k-4)/12 ) = sqrt( (k-2)(k-4)/8 ) =1/3,\n\nThus,\n\nEach term equals 1/3,\n\nFirst equation:\n\nsqrt( (k-2)(k-3)/6 ) =1/3 \u21d2 (k-2)(k-3)/6=1/9 \u21d2 (k-2)(k-3)=2/3,\n\nSecond

when terms are equal.\n\nHmm.\n\nAfter exploring multiple avenues without finding an exact solution analytically, I might need to consider that the problem requires an approximate solution, but since it's stated to have a unique solution and requires an exact answer, there must be an exact value that I'm missing.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the variables are designed such that a, b, c are related to

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find a unique triple (a, b, c) of positive real numbers that satisfy two equations. The first equation is that 2(a\u00b2 + 1) = 3(b\u00b2 + 1) = 4(c\u00b2 + 1), and the second equation is that ab + bc + ca = 1. Then I need to compute a + b + c. Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem mentions that all three expressions 2(a\u00b2 + 1), 3(b\u00b2 + 1), and 4(c\u00b2 + 1) are equal. Let me denote this common value as some constant k. So I can write:\n\n2(a\u00b2 + 1) = k  \n3(b\u00b2 + 1) = k  \n4(c\u00b2 + 1) = k  \n\nThat way, each equation can be solved for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, and c\u00b2 in terms of k. Let me do that.\n\nStarting with the first equation:  \n2(a\u00b2 + 1) = k \u21d2 a\u00b2 + 1 = k/2 \u21d2 a\u00b2 = (k/2) - 1 \u21d2 a = \u221a[(k/2) - 1]  \nSimilarly, for the second equation:  \n3(b\u00b2 + 1) = k \u21d2 b\u00b2 + 1 = k/3 \u21d2 b\u00b2 = (k/3) - 1 \u21d2 b = \u221a[(k/3) - 1]  \nAnd the third equation:  \n4(c\u00b2 + 1) = k \u21d2 c\u00b2 + 1 = k/4 \u21d2 c\u00b2 = (k/4) - 1 \u21d2 c = \u221a[(k/4) - 1]  \n\nSince a, b, and c are positive real numbers, the expressions under the square roots must be non-negative. So, (k/2) - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 2, similarly (k/3) -1 \u22650 \u21d2 k \u2265 3, and (k/4) -1 \u22650 \u21d2 k \u2265 4. Since they all have to hold, the smallest k must be at least 4. Wait, hold on, actually, the first condition gives k \u2265 2, second k \u22653, and third k \u22654. So the most restrictive is k \u22654. Therefore, k must be at least 4.\n\nBut since the problem states there is a unique solution, maybe we can find k such that all three expressions are valid, and then also satisfy the second equation ab + bc + ca =1. So, maybe we can express a, b, c in terms of k, plug into the second equation, and solve for k?\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me denote:\n\nLet me write a = sqrt[(k/2) -1], b = sqrt[(k/3)-1], c = sqrt[(k/4)-1]\n\nThen, the second equation ab + bc + ca =1. So, substituting these expressions into that equation would give an equation in terms of k only. Then, solving for k would allow us to find a, b, c, and then compute a + b + c.\n\nBut this seems like it might get complicated because of the square roots and the products. Let me see if I can find another way or perhaps simplify the equations first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set all three expressions equal to k and express each variable in terms of k, then proceed. Since I need to compute a + b + c, perhaps once I have expressions for each variable in terms of k, I can compute their sum after finding k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a substitution or symmetry here. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such as x = a\u00b2, y = b\u00b2, z = c\u00b2. Then, the equations become:\n\n2(x +1) = 3(y +1) =4(z +1) =k, so same as before, but with x, y, z.\n\nThen, x = (k/2) -1, y = (k/3)-1, z=(k/4)-1.\n\nBut then the second equation is ab + bc + ca =1. Since a, b, c are positive, a = sqrt(x), etc. So:\n\nsqrt(x)*sqrt(y) + sqrt(y)*sqrt(z) + sqrt(z)*sqrt(x) =1\n\nHmm. That might be a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe introduce variables like letting a = tan A, b = tan B, c = tan C for some angles? Not sure if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variables such that u = a / sqrt(2), v = b / sqrt(3), w = c / sqrt(4) or something like that? Let me see.\n\nWait, let's think again. Since 2(a\u00b2 +1) = k, so a\u00b2 = (k/2) -1, so perhaps express variables in terms of k as before, but then plug into ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nLet me try to write expressions for ab, bc, and ca.\n\nFirst, let me note that:\n\na = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ),  \nb = sqrt( (k/3 -1) ),  \nc = sqrt( (k/4 -1) )\n\nTherefore, ab = sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)},  \nbc = sqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)},  \nca = sqrt{(k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)}  \n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)} + sqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)} + sqrt{(k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)} =1\n\nThis equation in terms of k would need to be solved for k. Hmm, this looks quite complicated. The equation is a sum of three square roots equal to 1, and each square root has a product of terms involving k. Solving this equation algebraically might be challenging. Maybe there's a substitution or perhaps some symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me denote t = k, so that the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt{( (t/2 -1)(t/3 -1) )} + sqrt{( (t/3 -1)(t/4 -1) )} + sqrt{( (t/4 -1)(t/2 -1) )} =1\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables in terms of t, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can let k be a multiple of 12 to eliminate denominators. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I let k = 12m, so that denominators 2,3,4 divide into 12. Then:\n\nThen,\n\na\u00b2 = (12m)/2 -1 =6m -1,\n\nb\u00b2 = (12m)/3 -1 =4m -1,\n\nc\u00b2 = (12m)/4 -1 =3m -1,\n\nTherefore, a = sqrt(6m -1), b= sqrt(4m -1), c = sqrt(3m -1)\n\nThen the equation ab + bc + ca =1 becomes:\n\nsqrt{(6m -1)(4m -1)} + sqrt{(4m -1)(3m -1)} + sqrt{(3m -1)(6m -1)} =1\n\nHmm, this still looks complicated, but perhaps easier to handle with m as variable. Maybe trying to find m such that this holds?\n\nAlternatively, maybe m is a simple number. Since the problem states there is a unique solution, perhaps m is an integer or a simple fraction. Let me try plugging in m=1.\n\nTesting m=1:\n\nThen,\n\na = sqrt(6*1 -1)=sqrt(5)\u22482.236,\n\nb= sqrt(4*1 -1)=sqrt(3)\u22481.732,\n\nc= sqrt(3*1 -1)=sqrt(2)\u22481.414,\n\nThen compute ab + bc + ca:\n\nsqrt(5)*sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)*sqrt(2) + sqrt(2)*sqrt(5)\n\n= sqrt(15) + sqrt(6) + sqrt(10)\n\n\u22483.872 + 2.449 + 3.162 \u22489.483, which is way more than 1. So that's not it.\n\nHmm, so m=1 gives a large value. Maybe m is less than 1?\n\nBut remember earlier we had k must be at least 4, so m must be at least 4/12 = 1/3? Wait k =12m, so if k must be at least 4, then m \u2265 4/12 = 1/3 \u22480.333.\n\nSo m must be at least 1/3. Let me try m=1/2, so k=6.\n\nThen,\n\na= sqrt(6*(1/2)-1)=sqrt(3 -1)=sqrt(2)\u22481.414,\n\nb= sqrt(4*(1/2)-1)=sqrt(2-1)=1,\n\nc= sqrt(3*(1/2)-1)=sqrt(1.5 -1)=sqrt(0.5)\u22480.707,\n\nThen ab + bc + ca:\n\nsqrt(2)*1 +1*sqrt(0.5) + sqrt(0.5)*sqrt(2)\n\n= sqrt(2) + sqrt(0.5) + sqrt(1)\n\n\u22481.414 + 0.707 +1 \u22483.121, still way more than 1.\n\nHmm, still too big.

Still bigger than 1 but closer.\n\nHmm, trying m=0.35, so k=4.2.\n\nWait, m=0.35, so 12m=4.2:\n\na= sqrt(6*0.35 -1)=sqrt(2.1 -1)=sqrt(1.1)\u22481.048,\n\nb= sqrt(4*0.35 -1)=sqrt(1.4 -1)=sqrt(0.4)=0.632,\n\nc= sqrt(3*0.35 -1)=sqrt(1.05 -1)=sqrt(0.05)=0.2236,\n\nThen ab + bc + ca:\n\n1.048*0.632 \u22480.662,\n\n0.632*0.2236\u22480.141,\n\n0.2236*1.048\u22480.234,\n\nTotal \u22480.662+0.141+0.234\u22481.037. Close to 1, but still over.\n\nHmm, maybe m=0.34:\n\nk=12*0.34=4.08,\n\na= sqrt(6*0.34 -1)=sqrt(2.04 -1)=sqrt(1.04)=\u22481.0198,\n\nb= sqrt(4*0.34 -1)=sqrt(1.36 -1)=sqrt(0.36)=0.6,\n\nc= sqrt(3*0.34 -1)=sqrt(1.02 -1)=sqrt(0.02)=\u22480.1414,\n\nThen ab + bc + ca:\n\n1.0198*0.6\u22480.6119,\n\n0.6*0.1414\u22480.0848,\n\n0.1414*1.0198\u22480.144,\n\nTotal\u22480.6119+0.0848\u22480.6967+0.144\u22480.8407. Now it's below 1. Hmm, so between m=0.34 and m=0.35?\n\nWait, at m=0.34 gives sum\u22480.84, m=0.35 gives\u22481.037. So the solution is between 0.34 and 0.35. Hmm, but maybe this trial and error isn't the best approach. Maybe there's a smarter way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of substituting variables, set variables such that the equations can be connected.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nWe have 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k. Let me call this common value k. So, from the first equation, a\u00b2 = (k/2) -1,\n\nFrom the second, b\u00b2 = (k/3) -1,\n\nThird equation, c\u00b2 = (k/4) -1.\n\nWe also have ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps introduce variables for a, b, c in terms of k, then square both sides? Although that might complicate things, but let me try.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write a = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ) = sqrt( (k -2)/2 )\n\nSimilarly, b = sqrt( (k -3)/3 ), c = sqrt( (k -4)/4 )\n\nWait, actually, that's exactly the same as before, right? Since (k/2 -1)= (k-2)/2, etc. So, if I write variables as sqrt( (k-2)/2 ), etc., maybe that's easier notation.\n\nSo, a = sqrt( (k-2)/2 )\n\nb = sqrt( (k-3)/3 )\n\nc = sqrt( (k-4)/4 )\n\nThen, the equation ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps square both sides of the equation? But that would lead to (ab + bc + ca)^2 =1, which expands to a\u00b2b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\u00b2 + 2abc(a + b + c) =1. Hmm, but that might not help directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider using substitution with trigonometric functions? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables to be proportional to each other?\n\nAlternatively, consider that since the equations are symmetric in a way, perhaps setting variables in terms of t?\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of variables in terms of each other. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set x = a^2, y = b^2, z = c^2. Then, the equations are:\n\n2(x +1)=3(y +1)=4(z +1)=k,\n\nand sqrt(x y) + sqrt(y z) + sqrt(z x)=1.\n\nHmm, but that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such that:\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nso then:\n\na\u00b2 = (k/2) -1,\n\nb\u00b2 = (k/3) -1,\n\nc\u00b2 = (k/4) -1,\n\nTherefore, substituting into the second equation,\n\nab + bc + ca =1,\n\nLet me consider that each term is sqrt[(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)] + sqrt[(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)] + sqrt[(k/4 -1)(k/2 -1)] =1.\n\nHmm, this equation is quite complex, but perhaps we can make a substitution for k?\n\nAlternatively, maybe let\u2019s set t = k - 4, so that the terms under the square roots become:\n\nFor a\u00b2: ( (t +4)/2 -1 ) = (t +4 - 2)/2 = (t +2)/2,\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2: ( (t +4)/3 -1 ) = (t +4 -3)/3 = (t +1)/3,\n\nc\u00b2: ( (t +4)/4 -1 ) = (t +4 -4)/4 = t/4.\n\nTherefore, substituting t = k -4, then:\n\na = sqrt( (t +2)/2 )\n\nb = sqrt( (t +1)/3 )\n\nc = sqrt( t/4 )\n\nThen the equation ab + bc + ca =1 becomes:\n\nsqrt( (t+2)/2 * (t+1)/3 ) + sqrt( (t+1)/3 * t/4 ) + sqrt( t/4 * (t+2)/2 ) =1\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term inside sqrt: [(t+2)(t+1)]/(2*3) = [(t+2)(t+1)]/6,\n\nSecond term: [(t+1)t]/(3*4)= [t(t+1)]/12,\n\nThird term: [t(t+2)]/(4*2)= [t(t+2)]/8,\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( [(t+2)(t+1)/6 ]) + sqrt( [t(t+1)/12 ]) + sqrt( [t(t+2)/8 ]) =1\n\nHmm, perhaps this is a bit better, but still complicated. Maybe let me factor out some terms?\n\nLet me write each term as:\n\nFirst term: sqrt( [(t+1)(t+2)] ) / sqrt(6),\n\nSecond term: sqrt( [t(t+1)] ) / sqrt(12),\n\nThird term: sqrt( [t(t+2)] ) / sqrt(8),\n\nSo:\n\n[sqrt{(t+1)(t+2)}]/sqrt(6) + [sqrt{t(t+1)}]/sqrt(12) + [sqrt{t t+2)}]/sqrt(8) =1\n\nHmm, perhaps factor sqrt(t+1), sqrt(t), sqrt(t+2), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote sqrt(t) as some variable, but maybe that complicates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps square both sides. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the left-hand side as S:\n\nS = sqrt(A) + sqrt(B) + sqrt(C) =1,\n\nwhere:\n\nA = [(t+2)(t+1)]/6,\n\nB = [t(t+1)]/12,\n\nC = [t(t+2)]/8,\n\nThen S^2 = A + B + C + 2[ sqrt(AB) + sqrt(AC) + sqrt(BC) ]\n\nTherefore, setting S^2 =1,\n\nSo,\n\nA + B + C + 2(sqrt(AB) + sqrt(AC) + sqrt(BC)) =1,\n\nBut this seems even more complicated. Maybe this is not the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps suppose that t is a nice integer? Let me see.\n\nWait, since the problem states that there is a unique solution, perhaps t is a positive number such that the expressions inside the square roots are perfect squares? Maybe not necessarily, but perhaps t is chosen such that the terms inside the sqrt are manageable?\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to assume that the triple (a, b, c) is proportional to (something). Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables to be in terms of trigonometric functions. Let me think.\n\nWait, let me consider that the equations 2(a\u00b2 +1) = 3(b\u00b2 +1) =4(c\u00b2 +1) can be thought of as each variable's expression in terms of k. Since they all equal k, perhaps we can set up ratios between a, b, c?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express all variables in terms of a single variable.\n\nSuppose I let\u2019s pick one variable as a parameter, say a. Then express b and c in terms of a.\n\nGiven that 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nSo from the first equation, k=2(a\u00b2 +1),\n\nTherefore, from the second equation, 3(b\u00b2 +1)=2(a\u00b2 +1) \u21d2 b\u00b2 = (2(a\u00b2 +1))/3 -1,\n\nSimilarly, c\u00b2 = (2(a\u00b2 +1))/4 -1 = (a\u00b2 +1)/2 -1,\n\nTherefore, expressions for b and c in terms of a:\n\nb = sqrt( (2(a\u00b2 +1)/3 -1 ) )\n\nc = sqrt( ( (a\u00b2 +1)/2 -1 ) )\n\nThen the equation ab + bc + ca =1 can be written entirely in terms of a.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\na*b + b*c + c*a =1,\n\nBut since b and c are expressed in terms of a, this becomes an equation in a only. Then, solving for a would allow us to find b and c, and compute a + b + c.\n\nThis seems like a viable path, but the equation might still be complex.\n\nLet me write expressions:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s set variable a,\n\nThen,\n\nb = sqrt( (2(a\u00b2 +1)/3 -1 ) )\n\nLet me compute the expression inside the sqrt for b:\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1)/3 -1 = (2a\u00b2 +2)/3 -1 = (2a\u00b2 +2 -3)/3 = (2a\u00b2 -1)/3,\n\nSimilarly, for c:\n\nc = sqrt( ( (a\u00b2 +1)/2 -1 ) = sqrt( (a\u00b2 +1 -2)/2 ) = sqrt( (a\u00b2 -1)/2 )\n\nTherefore, expressions:\n\nb = sqrt( (2a\u00b2 -1)/3 )\n\nc = sqrt( (a\u00b2 -1)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the equation ab + bc + ca =1 becomes:\n\na * sqrt( (2a\u00b2 -1)/3 ) + sqrt( (2a\u00b2 -1)/3 ) * sqrt( (a\u00b2 -1)/2 ) + sqrt( (a\u00b2 -1)/2 ) * a =1\n\nThis looks very complicated, but perhaps we can make substitutions here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set x = a\u00b2, so that expressions become in terms of x.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet x = a\u00b2,\n\nThen,\n\nb = sqrt( (2x -1)/3 )\n\nc = sqrt( (x -1)/2 )\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(x) * sqrt( (2x -1)/3 ) + sqrt( (2x -1)/3 ) * sqrt( (x -1)/2 ) + sqrt( (x -1)/2 ) * sqrt(x) =1\n\nHmm. Maybe this can be simplified by factoring terms?\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst term: sqrt(x) * sqrt( (2x -1)/3 ) = sqrt[ x*(2x -1)/3 ]\n\nSecond term: sqrt( (2x -1)/3 ) * sqrt( (x -1)/2 ) = sqrt[ (2x -1)(x -1)/(6) ]\n\nThird term: sqrt( (x -1)/2 ) * sqrt(x) = sqrt[ x*(x -1)/2 ]\n\nTherefore,\n\nsqrt[ (2x\u00b2 -x)/3 ] + sqrt[ (2x\u00b2 -3x +1)/6 ] + sqrt[ (x\u00b2 -x)/2 ] =1\n\nHmm, that's still complicated, but perhaps we can let\u2019s see if the terms inside the square roots can be expressed as squares?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps choose a substitution for x. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if x is 2? Let me try x=2:\n\nThen,\n\nFirst term inside sqrt: (2*(4) -2)/3 = (8 -2)/3=6/3=2 \u21d2 sqrt(2*2/3)=sqrt( (4)/3 )? Wait, wait, first term:\n\nWait, when x=2,\n\nFirst term: sqrt(x*(2x -1)/3 ) = sqrt(2*(4-1)/3)=sqrt(2*3/3)=sqrt(2)\u22481.414,\n\nSecond term: sqrt( (2x\u00b2 -3x +1)/6 ) = sqrt( (8 -6 +1)/6 )=sqrt(3/6)=sqrt(0.5)\u22480.707,\n\nThird term: sqrt( (x\u00b2 -x)/2 )=sqrt( (4 -2)/2 )=sqrt(1)=1,\n\nTotal: 1.414 +0.707 +1\u22483.121. Which is the same as earlier when m=0.5, since k=2(a\u00b2+1)=2*(4+1)=10? Wait, no, wait, when x=2, a\u00b2=2 so a=\u221a2, then k=2*(2+1)=6, so m=0.5. Which matches with previous calculation. So that gives 3.121, which is over 1.\n\nHmm, trying x=1.2 (so a\u22481.095):\n\nThen x=1.2,\n\nFirst term: sqrt(1.2*(2*1.2 -1)/3)=sqrt(1.2*(2.4-1)/3)=sqrt(1.2*1.4/3)=sqrt(1.68/3)=sqrt(0.56)=\u22480.748,\n\nSecond term: sqrt( (2*(1.44) -3*1.2 +1)/6 )=sqrt( (2.88 -3.6 +1)/6)=sqrt(0.28/6)=sqrt(0.0467)\u22480.216,\n\nThird term: sqrt( (1.44 -1.2)/2 )=sqrt(0.24/2)=sqrt(0.12)=\u22480.346,\n\nTotal\u22480.748+0.216\u22480.964 +0.346\u22481.31. Still over 1.\n\nHmm, trying x=1.1,\n\nThen x=1.1,\n\nFirst term:\n\nsqrt(1.1*(2*1.1 -1)/3)=sqrt(1.1*(2.2-1)/3)=sqrt(1.1*1.2/3)=sqrt(1.32/3)=sqrt(0.44)=\u22480.663,\n\nSecond term:\n\nsqrt( (2*(1.21) -3*(1.1) +1)/6)=sqrt(2.42 -3.3 +1)/6)=sqrt(0.12)/6? Wait,\n\nWait 2*(1.21)=2.42,\n\n-3*(1.1)= -3.3,\n\n+1: total numerator inside sqrt is 2.42 -3.3 +1=0.12,\n\nSo sqrt(0.12/6)=sqrt(0.02)=\u22480.141.\n\nThird term:\n\nsqrt( (1.21 -1.1)/2 )=sqrt(0.11/2)=sqrt(0.055)=\u22480.234,\n\nTotal\u22480.663+0.141\u22480.804 +0.234\u22481.038. Closer to 1.\n\nHmm, so at x=1.1, the sum is \u22481.038. Close to 1. Let me try x=1.08,\n\nx=1.08,\n\nFirst term:\n\nsqrt(1.08*(2*1.08 -1)/3) = sqrt(1.08*(2.16 -1)/3)=sqrt(1.08*1.16/3)=sqrt(1.2528/3)=sqrt(0.4176)=\u22480.646,\n\nSecond term:\n\n2x\u00b2=2*(1.1664)=2.3328,\n\n-3x= -3.24,\n\n+1: total numerator 2.3328 -3.24 +1=0.0928,\n\nso sqrt(0.0928/6)=sqrt(0.01547)=\u22480.124,\n\nThird term:\n\nsqrt( (x\u00b2 -x)/2 )=sqrt( (1.1664 -1.08)/2 )=sqrt(0.0864/2)=sqrt(0.0432)=\u22480.208,\n\nTotal\u22480.646 +0.124\u22480.77 +0.208\u22480.978. Hmm, so now it's 0.978, which is less than 1. So between x=1.08 and x=1.1.\n\nMaybe x=1.09,\n\nx=1.09,\n\nFirst term:\n\nsqrt(1.09*(2*1.09 -1)/3)=sqrt(1.09*(2.18-1)/3)=sqrt(1.09*1.18/3)=sqrt(1.2862/3)=sqrt(0.4287)=\u22480.655,\n\nSecond term:\n\n2x\u00b2=2*(1.1881)=2.3762,\n\n-3x= -3.27,\n\n+1: total numerator 2.3762 -3.27 +1\u22480.1062,\n\nsqrt(0.1062/6)=sqrt(0.0177)=\u22480.133,\n\nThird term:\n\nsqrt( (1.1881 -1.09)/2 )=sqrt(0.0981/2)=sqrt(0.049)=\u22480.221,\n\nTotal\u22480.655+0.133\u22480.788 +0.221\u22481.009. Almost 1.\n\nSo x\u22481.09 would give approximately 1.009. Close to 1. So perhaps the exact solution is at x=1.1 exactly? Let me check.\n\nWait, but maybe the exact value is at x=1.1? Let me check with x=1.1 exactly.\n\nWait, when x=1.1, the sum was \u22481.038, but perhaps my calculator was approximate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact solution is when some terms inside the square roots are perfect squares. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to set up an equation for x and solve it algebraically.\n\nLet me denote the equation:\n\nsqrt[ (2x\u00b2 -x)/3 ] + sqrt[ (2x\u00b2 -3x +1)/6 ] + sqrt[ (x\u00b2 -x)/2 ] =1\n\nLet me denote the three terms as:\n\nTerm1 = sqrt[ (2x\u00b2 -x)/3 ]\n\nTerm2 = sqrt[ (2x\u00b2 -3x +1)/6 ]\n\nTerm3 = sqrt[ (x\u00b2 -x)/2 ]\n\nSo Term1 + Term2 + Term3 =1\n\nLet me see if I can manipulate this equation.\n\nLet me note that the expressions inside the square roots may be related.\n\nLet me look at the numerators:\n\nTerm1: (2x\u00b2 -x)\n\nTerm2: (2x\u00b2 -3x +1) = (2x\u00b2 -2x -x +1) = 2x(x-1) - (x -1)= (2x-1)(x-1)\n\nWait, let me factor:\n\n2x\u00b2 -3x +1 = (2x -1)(x -1). Let me check: 2x*x=2x\u00b2, 2x*(-1)= -2x, (-1)*x= -x, (-1)*(-1)=1. So, total: 2x\u00b2 -3x +1. Yes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, the numerator in Term1: 2x\u00b2 -x =x(2x -1)\n\nThe numerator in Term3: x\u00b2 -x =x(x-1)\n\nSo, Term1: sqrt[ x(2x -1)/3 ]\n\nTerm2: sqrt[ (2x-1)(x-1)/6 ]\n\nTerm3: sqrt[ x(x-1)/2 ]\n\nHmm, so perhaps there is a common factor here? Let me see.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set u = sqrt(x), v = sqrt(x -1), w = sqrt(2x -1). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me set variables such that:\n\nLet me set sqrt(x) = A,\n\nsqrt(x -1) = B,\n\nsqrt(2x -1)=C,\n\nThen perhaps express terms in terms of A,B,C.\n\nBut I need to see if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set t = sqrt(x(x-1)(2x -1)), but that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that Term1 * Term3 = sqrt[ x(2x -1)/3 ] * sqrt[ x(x-1)/2 ] = sqrt{ x\u00b2(2x -1)(x -1)/6 }\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider squaring the entire equation.\n\nLet me try that, although it may be messy.\n\nLet me denote S = Term1 + Term2 + Term3 =1,\n\nThen S\u00b2 = Term1\u00b2 + Term2\u00b2 + Term3\u00b2 + 2(Term1 Term2 + Term1 Term3 + Term2 Term3) =1.\n\nCompute each part:\n\nTerm1\u00b2 = (2x\u00b2 -x)/3,\n\nTerm2\u00b2 = (2x\u00b2 -3x +1)/6,\n\nTerm3\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 -x)/2,\n\nSum of squares:\n\n(2x\u00b2 -x)/3 + (2x\u00b2 -3x +1)/6 + (x\u00b2 -x)/2,\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nConvert all to sixths:\n\n2*(2x\u00b2 -x)/6 + (2x\u00b2 -3x +1)/6 + 3*(x\u00b2 -x)/6,\n\n= [4x\u00b2 -2x +2x\u00b2 -3x +1 +3x\u00b2 -3x]/6,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x\u00b2 +2x\u00b2 +3x\u00b2 =9x\u00b2,\n\n-2x -3x -3x =-8x,\n\n+1,\n\nTotal numerator:9x\u00b2 -8x +1,\n\nSo sum of squares is (9x\u00b2 -8x +1)/6,\n\nTherefore, S\u00b2 = (9x\u00b2 -8x +1)/6 + 2(Term1 Term2 + Term1 Term3 + Term2 Term3) =1,\n\nTherefore,\n\n2(Term1 Term2 + Term1 Term3 + Term2 Term3) =1 - (9x\u00b2 -8x +1)/6 = (6 -9x\u00b2 +8x -1)/6 = (5 +8x -9x\u00b2)/6,\n\nThus,\n\nTerm1 Term2 + Term1 Term3 + Term2 Term3 = (5 +8x -9x\u00b2)/12,\n\nHmm, so now I have to compute Term1 Term2 + Term1 Term3 + Term2 Term3.\n\nLet me compute each product:\n\nFirst, Term1 * Term2 = sqrt[ (2x\u00b2 -x)/3 ] * sqrt[ (2x\u00b2 -3x +1)/6 ] = sqrt{ [(2x\u00b2 -x)(2x\u00b2 -3x +1)]/(3*6) } = sqrt{ [(2x\u00b2 -x)(2x\u00b2 -3x +1)]/18 }\n\nSimilarly, Term1 * Term3 = sqrt[ (2x\u00b2 -x)/3 ] * sqrt[ (x\u00b2 -x)/2 ] = sqrt{ [(2x\u00b2 -x)(x\u00b2 -x)]/(3*2) } = sqrt{ [(2x\u00b2 -x)(x\u00b2 -x)]/6 }\n\nTerm2 * Term3 = sqrt[ (2x\u00b2 -3x +1)/6 ] * sqrt[ (x\u00b2 -x)/2 ] = sqrt{ [(2x\u00b2 -3x +1)(x\u00b2 -x)]/(6*2) } = sqrt{ [(2x\u00b2 -3x +1)(x\u00b2 -x)]/12 }\n\nSo adding these three terms:\n\nsqrt{ [(2x\u00b2 -x)(2x\u00b2 -3x +1)]/18 } + sqrt{ [(2x\u00b2 -x)(x\u00b2 -x)]/6 } + sqrt{ [(2x\u00b2 -3x +1)(x\u00b2 -x)]/12 }\n\nThis looks really complicated. Perhaps expanding the numerators?\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst term numerator: (2x\u00b2 -x)(2x\u00b2 -3x +1)\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nMultiply term by term,\n\n2x\u00b2*(2x\u00b2)=4x\u2074,\n\n2x\u00b2*(-3x)= -6x\u00b3,\n\n2x\u00b2*1=2x\u00b2,\n\n- x*(2x\u00b2)= -2x\u00b3,\n\n- x*(-3x)=3x\u00b2,\n\n- x*1= -x,\n\nSo total:\n\n4x\u2074 -6x\u00b3 +2x\u00b2 -2x\u00b3 +3x\u00b2 -x =\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4x\u2074,\n\n-6x\u00b3 -2x\u00b3 = -8x\u00b3,\n\n2x\u00b2 +3x\u00b2 =5x\u00b2,\n\n- x,\n\nSo overall:4x\u2074 -8x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -x.\n\nSecond term numerator: (2x\u00b2 -x)(x\u00b2 -x)\n\nExpand:\n\n2x\u00b2*x\u00b2=2x\u2074,\n\n2x\u00b2*(-x)= -2x\u00b3,\n\n- x*x\u00b2= -x\u00b3,\n\n- x*(-x)=x\u00b2,\n\nTotal:\n\n2x\u2074 -2x\u00b3 -x\u00b3 +x\u00b2 =2x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +x\u00b2.\n\nThird term numerator: (2x\u00b2 -3x +1)(x\u00b2 -x)\n\nExpand:\n\n2x\u00b2*x\u00b2=2x\u2074,\n\n2x\u00b2*(-x)= -2x\u00b3,\n\n-3x*x\u00b2= -3x\u00b3,\n\n-3x*(-x)=3x\u00b2,\n\n1*x\u00b2= x\u00b2,\n\n1*(-x)= -x,\n\nTotal:\n\n2x\u2074 -2x\u00b3 -3x\u00b3 +3x\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -x\n\n=2x\u2074 -5x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2 -x.\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the terms:\n\nFirst term sqrt part:\n\nsqrt( [4x\u2074 -8x\u00b3 +5x\u00b2 -x]/18 )\n\nSecond term sqrt( [2x\u2074 -3x\u00b3 +x\u00b2]/6 )\n\nThird term sqrt( [2x\u2074 -5x\u00b3 +4x\u00b2 -x]/12 )\n\nThis seems too complicated. Maybe this is not the way to go. Perhaps there's a substitution I'm missing?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed so that a + b + c is a nice number, like sqrt(3) or 2, but since the problem states to compute it, we need to go through the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is an elegant substitution.\n\nWait, let me think back to the original equations. Let me recall that in the problem, the equations are 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k, and ab + bc + ca=1.\n\nSuppose that variables a, b, c are related such that a = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ), b = sqrt( (k/3 -1) ), c = sqrt( (k/4 -1) )\n\nLet me think of this as vectors or something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider variables like sin\u03b8, cos\u03b8 or hyperbolic functions but that might be overkill.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal case where variables are such that terms like (k/2 -1), etc., are perfect squares? Let me see.\n\nSuppose that (k/2 -1)=m\u00b2, (k/3 -1)=n\u00b2, (k/4 -1)=p\u00b2,\n\nThen, m\u00b2 =k/2 -1,\n\nn\u00b2 =k/3 -1,\n\np\u00b2 =k/4 -1,\n\nThus,\n\nk=2(m\u00b2 +1),\n\nk=3(n\u00b2 +1),\n\nk=4(p\u00b2 +1),\n\nSo, 2(m\u00b2 +1)=3(n\u00b2 +1)=4(p\u00b2 +1),\n\nSo, this is similar to the original equations but with variables m, n, p. Then, the equation ab + bc + ca=1 becomes:\n\nsqrt(2(m\u00b2 +1)/2 -1) * sqrt(2(m\u00b2 +1)/3 -1) + ... Wait, no, perhaps I need to re-express variables.\n\nWait, actually, a = m, since a = sqrt(k/2 -1)=sqrt(m\u00b2)=m,\n\nSimilarly, b =n,\n\nc=p,\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes ab + bc + ca = mn + np + pm =1.\n\nWait, that's interesting! Wait hold on:\n\nWait, if I set m = a,\n\nthen m\u00b2 = (k/2 -1),\n\nso k =2(m\u00b2 +1),\n\nSimilarly, b =n,\n\nn\u00b2 =k/3 -1= (2(m\u00b2 +1))/3 -1,\n\nso n\u00b2 = (2m\u00b2 +2 -3)/3= (2m\u00b2 -1)/3,\n\nSimilarly, c=p,\n\np\u00b2 =k/4 -1= (2(m\u00b2 +1))/4 -1= (m\u00b2 +1)/2 -1= (m\u00b2 -1)/2,\n\nTherefore, variables n and p are expressed in terms of m,\n\nThen the equation becomes mn + np + pm =1,\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nmn + n p + p m =1,\n\nLet me write n and p in terms of m:\n\nn = sqrt( (2m\u00b2 -1)/3 ),\n\np = sqrt( (m\u00b2 -1)/2 ),\n\nSo,\n\nm * sqrt( (2m\u00b2 -1)/3 ) + sqrt( (2m\u00b2 -1)/3 ) * sqrt( (m\u00b2 -1)/2 ) + sqrt( (m\u00b2 -1)/2 ) * m =1,\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. So it's not helpful.\n\nHmm, perhaps trying to set m as a trigonometric function?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the problem states that the solution is unique, so maybe the variables a, b, c satisfy some condition where their sum can be found via some identity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider Vieta\u2019s formula. Suppose that a, b, c are roots of some cubic equation. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that a, b, c are roots of x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Px - Q =0,\n\nWhere S = a + b + c,\n\nP = ab + bc + ca =1,\n\nQ = abc,\n\nSo, the equation would be x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + x - Q =0.\n\nBut I don't know Q, so maybe this isn't helpful unless we can find another relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find expressions for a + b + c in terms of k.\n\nSince a = sqrt( (k-2)/2 ), b = sqrt( (k-3)/3 ), c = sqrt( (k-4)/4 ),\n\nThen, a + b + c = sqrt( (k-2)/2 ) + sqrt( (k-3)/3 ) + sqrt( (k-4)/4 )\n\nIf we can express this in terms of k, but we need to find k such that ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal case when k is minimal. Since k must be at least 4, but when k=4,\n\nthen a = sqrt( (4-2)/2 )=sqrt(1)=1,\n\nb= sqrt( (4-3)/3 )=sqrt(1/3)=\u22480.577,\n\nc= sqrt( (4-4)/4 )=0,\n\nBut c=0, but the problem requires positive real numbers, so c can't be zero. So k must be greater than 4.\n\nWait, but if k approaches 4 from above, then c approaches 0, but still positive. But the equation ab + bc + ca would approach ab +0 +0 =ab. Let me see with k=4.0001,\n\nThen a\u2248sqrt(2.00005)=\u22481.4142,\n\nb\u2248sqrt(0.3333666)=\u22480.57735,\n\nc\u2248sqrt(0.000025)=\u22480.005,\n\nThen ab\u22481.4142 *0.57735\u22480.816,\n\nAnd bc\u22480.57735*0.005\u22480.0029,\n\nca\u22481.4142 *0.005\u22480.007,\n\nTotal\u22480.816+0.0029+0.007\u22480.8259, which is less than 1.\n\nHmm, so as k increases from 4 upwards, the value of ab + bc + ca increases from ~0.825 upwards?\n\nWait, but earlier when k=6, the total was around 3.12, so actually, it increases beyond 1. So there must be a unique k between 4 and 6 where the total is exactly 1. Since the problem states it's unique, so there is exactly one such k.\n\nBut how to find it exactly?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the expressions inside the square roots can be expressed as squares? Let me see.\n\nSuppose that (k-2)/2 = p\u00b2,\n\n(k-3)/3 = q\u00b2,\n\n(k-4)/4 = r\u00b2,\n\nThen, a = p, b = q, c = r,\n\nSo, the equation becomes pq + qr + rp =1.\n\nAlso, we have:\n\nFrom the first equation: k =2p\u00b2 +2,\n\nSecond: k =3q\u00b2 +3,\n\nThird: k =4r\u00b2 +4,\n\nSo, 2p\u00b2 +2 =3q\u00b2 +3=4r\u00b2 +4,\n\nTherefore,\n\n2p\u00b2 =3q\u00b2 +1,\n\n3q\u00b2 =4r\u00b2 +1,\n\nSo,\n\nFrom second equation, 3q\u00b2 =4r\u00b2 +1 \u21d2 q\u00b2=(4r\u00b2 +1)/3,\n\nSubstitute into first equation,\n\n2p\u00b2 =3*( (4r\u00b2 +1)/3 ) +1 \u21d2 2p\u00b2 =4r\u00b2 +1 +1 \u21d22p\u00b2 =4r\u00b2 +2 \u21d2 p\u00b2=2r\u00b2 +1,\n\nSo, p\u00b2=2r\u00b2 +1,\n\nand q\u00b2=(4r\u00b2 +1)/3,\n\nNow, the equation pq + qr + rp =1,\n\nLet me express all variables in terms of r.\n\nLet me set variable r as t.\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set t = r,\n\nThus, p\u00b2 =2t\u00b2 +1 \u21d2 p = sqrt(2t\u00b2 +1),\n\nq\u00b2=(4t\u00b2 +1)/3 \u21d2 q= sqrt( (4t\u00b2 +1)/3 ),\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(2t\u00b2 +1)*sqrt( (4t\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (4t\u00b2 +1)/3 )*t + t*sqrt(2t\u00b2 +1 ) =1,\n\nHmm, this still looks complex.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(2t\u00b2 +1) as A and sqrt( (4t\u00b2 +1)/3 ) as B,\n\nThen the equation is A*B + B*t + t*A =1,\n\nFactor terms:\n\nAB + tA + tB = A(B + t) + tB = ?\n\nAlternatively, factor terms:\n\nA(B + t) + B t =1,\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor differently:\n\nAB + t(A + B)=1,\n\nHmm, maybe set variables such that A and B can be expressed in terms that allow this to be simplified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set u = t,\n\nThen,\n\nLet me write the equation as:\n\nsqrt(2u\u00b2 +1) * sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + u*sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + u*sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1) =1,\n\nHmm, perhaps factor sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 + sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1) )? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1) as P and sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ) as Q,\n\nThen,\n\nP Q + Q u + P u =1,\n\nWhich is P(Q + u) + Q u =1,\n\nHmm, perhaps set v = u + Q,\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that 4u\u00b2 +1 is related to 2u\u00b2 +1.\n\nLet me see:\n\n4u\u00b2 +1 = 2*(2u\u00b2) +1,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me square both sides of the equation:\n\nLet me write S = PQ + Qu + Pu =1,\n\nThen S\u00b2 = (PQ + Qu + Pu)^2 = P\u00b2Q\u00b2 + Q\u00b2u\u00b2 + P\u00b2u\u00b2 + 2PQ*Qu + 2PQ*Pu + 2Qu*Pu,\n\nWait, expanding (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac +2bc,\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 = (PQ)^2 + (Qu)^2 + (Pu)^2 + 2(PQ)(Qu) + 2(PQ)(Pu) + 2(Qu)(Pu) =1\u00b2=1,\n\nNow, substituting back P and Q:\n\nFirst term: (PQ)^2 = (2u\u00b2 +1)*( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 )\n\nSecond term: (Qu)^2 = u\u00b2*(4u\u00b2 +1)/3\n\nThird term: (Pu)^2 = (2u\u00b2 +1)*u\u00b2\n\nFourth term: 2(PQ)(Qu)=2u PQ^2 =2u*(sqrt(2u\u00b2 +1)*sqrt( (4u\u00b2 +1)/3 ))^2 ?\n\nWait, no, PQ is the product of P and Q, so:\n\n2(PQ)(Qu)=2*P Q * Q u = 2 P Q\u00b2 u,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2(PQ)(Pu)=2 P Q P u=2 P\u00b2 Q u,\n\n2(Qu)(Pu)=2 Q u P u=2 P Q u\u00b2,\n\nHmm, this is getting too involved. Perhaps this approach isn't the way to go.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think numerically. Since we know that when k=4. something, the sum is 1. Let me try to use the previous trial and error but with more precision.\n\nEarlier, when m=0.34, which corresponds to k=4.08, we had sum\u22480.84,\n\nAt m=0.35 (k=4.2), sum\u22481.037,\n\nWait, but earlier with x=1.09 (which corresponds to a^2=1.09 \u21d2 a\u22481.044, then k=2*(1.09 +1)=4.18,\n\nWait let me check:\n\nWait x= a\u00b2=1.09 \u21d2k=2*(1.09+1)=4.18,\n\nThen, compute b and c:\n\nb= sqrt( (k/3 -1) )=sqrt( (4.18/3 -1) )\u2248sqrt(1.393 -1)=sqrt(0.393)\u22480.627,\n\nc= sqrt( (4.18/4 -1) )=sqrt(1.045 -1)=sqrt(0.045)=\u22480.212,\n\nThen ab + bc + ca:\n\n1.044*0.627\u22480.655,\n\n0.627*0.212\u22480.133,\n\n0.212*1.044\u22480.221,\n\nTotal\u22480.655+0.133+0.221\u22481.009,\n\nWhich is very close to 1. So perhaps k\u22484.18 gives the desired result. But since the problem states that the solution is unique and exact, there must be an exact value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is sqrt(3), but let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal case where variables are 1, sqrt(3), etc. Wait, let me think differently.\n\nLet me suppose that a, b, c are such that a=2b, or some proportion? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the equations can be written as:\n\nLet me set variables such that a = sqrt( (k/2 -1) )\n\nSimilarly for others, and then maybe set variables to satisfy Pythagorean identities?\n\nAlternatively, think of k as (2a\u00b2 + 2) = (3b\u00b2 +3)= (4c\u00b2 +4). Let me denote them as:\n\nLet\u2019s set 2a\u00b2 +2 =3b\u00b2 +3=4c\u00b2 +4=K,\n\nTherefore,\n\n2a\u00b2 = K -2,\n\n3b\u00b2 = K -3,\n\n4c\u00b2 = K -4,\n\nSo,\n\na = sqrt( (K-2)/2 ),\n\nb = sqrt( (K-3)/3 ),\n\nc = sqrt( (K-4)/4 ),\n\nAnd the equation ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nLet me see if there's a value of K that makes ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nLet me consider that when K=6,\n\nThen,\n\na= sqrt(4/2)=sqrt(2),\n\nb= sqrt(3/3)=1,\n\nc= sqrt(2/4)=sqrt(0.5),\n\nSo ab + bc + ca = sqrt(2)*1 +1*sqrt(0.5)+sqrt(0.5)*sqrt(2)= sqrt(2) + sqrt(0.5) +1\u22481.414+0.707+1\u22483.121>1.\n\nK=5,\n\nThen,\n\na= sqrt(3/2)=\u22481.225,\n\nb= sqrt(2/3)=\u22480.816,\n\nc= sqrt(1/4)=0.5,\n\nThen ab\u22481.225*0.816\u22481.0,\n\nbc\u22480.816*0.5\u22480.408,\n\nca\u22480.5*1.225\u22480.612,\n\nTotal\u22481.0+0.408+0.612=2.02>1.\n\nHmm, K=4.5,\n\nThen,\n\na= sqrt( (4.5-2)/2 )=sqrt(2.5/2)=sqrt(1.25)=\u22481.118,\n\nb= sqrt( (4.5-3)/3)=sqrt(1.5/3)=sqrt(0.5)=\u22480.707,\n\nc= sqrt( (4.5-4)/4)=sqrt(0.5/4)=sqrt(0.125)=\u22480.353,\n\nThen ab\u22481.118*0.707\u22480.79,\n\nbc\u22480.707*0.353\u22480.25,\n\nca\u22480.353*1.118\u22480.395,\n\nTotal\u22480.79+0.25+0.395\u22481.435>1.\n\nHmm, K=4.25,\n\nThen,\n\na= sqrt( (4.25-2)/2)=sqrt(2.25/2)=sqrt(1.125)=\u22481.06,\n\nb= sqrt( (4.25-3)/3)=sqrt(1.25/3)=sqrt(0.4167)=\u22480.645,\n\nc= sqrt( (4.25-4)/4)=sqrt(0.25/4)=sqrt(0.0625)=0.25,\n\nab\u22481.06*0.645\u22480.684,\n\nbc=0.645*0.25\u22480.161,\n\nca=0.25*1.06\u22480.265,\n\nTotal\u22480.684+0.161+0.265\u22481.11,\n\nClose to 1.1.\n\nK=4.1,\n\na= sqrt( (4.1-2)/2)=sqrt(2.1/2)=sqrt(1.05)=\u22481.024,\n\nb= sqrt( (4.1-3)/3)=sqrt(1.1/3)=sqrt(0.3667)=\u22480.605,\n\nc= sqrt( (4.1-4)/4)=sqrt(0.1/4)=sqrt(0.025)=\u22480.158,\n\nab\u22481.024*0.605\u22480.62,\n\nbc\u22480.605*0.158\u22480.0955,\n\nca\u22480.158*1.024\u22480.162,\n\nTotal\u22480.62+0.0955+0.162\u22480.8775 <1.\n\nHmm, so between K=4.1 and K=4.25.\n\nWait, when K=4.2,\n\na= sqrt( (4.2-2)/2)=sqrt(2.2/2)=sqrt(1.1)=\u22481.0488,\n\nb= sqrt( (4.2-3)/3)=sqrt(1.2/3)=sqrt(0.4)=\u22480.632,\n\nc= sqrt( (4.2-4)/4)=sqrt(0.2/4)=sqrt(0.05)=\u22480.2236,\n\nThen,\n\nab\u22481.0488*0.632\u22480.663,\n\nbc\u22480.632*0.2236\u22480.141,\n\nca\u22480.2236*1.0488\u22480.234,\n\nTotal\u22480.663+0.141+0.234\u22481.038,\n\nHmm, so between K=4.1 (0.8775) and K=4.2 (1.038).

not helpful.\n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Maybe the problem requires a substitution that I haven't thought of yet.\n\nAlternatively, think of variables as follows:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set x = a\u00b2, y = b\u00b2, z = c\u00b2,\n\nThen,\n\n2(x +1) =3(y +1)=4(z +1)=k,\n\nand\n\nsqrt(xy)+sqrt(yz)+sqrt(zx)=1,\n\nAlso, we need to find sqrt(x)+sqrt(y)+sqrt(z).\n\nLet me consider that the first set of equations can be written as:\n\nx = (k/2 -1),\n\ny = (k/3 -1),\n\nz = (k/4 -1),\n\nThus, the variables x, y, z are linear functions of k.\n\nLet me consider solving for k numerically since an exact solution might be too involved.\n\nEarlier, when k \u22484.18, the sum ab + bc + ca \u22481.009,\n\nClose enough. Let's try to approximate k more precisely.\n\nLet me use linear approximation.\n\nSuppose at k=4.18, the sum is 1.009,\n\nAt k=4.17,\n\nCompute:\n\na= sqrt( (4.17-2)/2

between k=4.173 and 4.175, the sum is 0.998 to 1.002,\n\nUsing linear approximation,\n\nThe difference between k=4.173 (sum=0.998) and k=4.175 (sum=1.002),\n\nTo reach sum=1.0,\n\nThe required k is approximately 4.173 + (0.002)/(0.004)*0.002=?\n\nWait, the difference between the two k values is 0.002,\n\nThe difference in sums is 0.004,\n\nTo get from 0.998 to1.0, need 0.002 increase,\n\nThus, the required k is 4.173 + (0.002/0.004)*0.002= 4.173 +0.001=4.174,\n\nThus, approximate k\u22484.174,\n\nThus,\n\na= sqrt( (4.174-2)/2 )=sqrt(2.174/2)=sqrt(1.087)=\u22481.0426,\n\nb= sqrt(

1.877,\n\nHmm, but the problem says it's a unique triple of positive real numbers, so maybe the exact value is sqrt(3.52), but that's not a nice number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that a + b + c is sqrt(3), but my approximation is about 1.877, and sqrt(3)\u22481.732, so not quite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 2?\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is 2, but my approximation is 1.88, which is less than 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is sqrt(3.5225)=1.877, but that's an exact decimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact solution is 2?\n\nWait, let me see if k=6 gives a + b + c= sqrt(2)+1+sqrt(0.5)=\u22481.414+1+0.707\u22483.121,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 2, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in my numerical calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation and see that the answer is 2, but the problem states it's unique, so maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the following.\n\nSuppose that the three terms 2(a\u00b2 +1), 3(b\u00b2 +1),4(c\u00b2 +1) are all equal to k,\n\nThen, we can write:\n\nLet me denote the common value as k,\n\nThen,\n\na\u00b2 = (k/2 -1),\n\nb\u00b2 = (k/3 -1),\n\nc\u00b2 = (k/4 -1),\n\nThen, the equation ab + bc + ca =1,\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nLet me set variables as follows:\n\nLet me let\u2019s let\u2019s set a = sqrt(x),\n\nb = sqrt(y),\n\nc = sqrt(z),\n\nThen,\n\nx = (k/2 -1),\n\ny = (k/3 -1),\n\nz = (k/4 -1),\n\nAnd the equation becomes sqrt(xy) + sqrt(yz) + sqrt(zx) =1,\n\nWe need to find sqrt(x) + sqrt(y) + sqrt(z).\n\nLet me consider the following substitution:\n\nLet me set sqrt(xy) = m,\n\nsqrt(yz) =n,\n\nsqrt(zx)=p,\n\nThen, the equation becomes m +n +p=1,\n\nAlso,\n\nm^2 =xy,\n\nn^2 =yz,\n\np^2 =zx,\n\nMultiplying all three,\n\nm^2 n^2 p^2 =x y z x y z= (xyz)^2,\n\nThus,\n\nm n p =xyz,\n\nBut this may not help.\n\nAlternatively, note that:\n\nLet me define variables in terms of m,n,p,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the system of equations is symmetric and the solution requires variables to be in a particular proportion.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that a, b, c are in geometric progression.\n\nLet me suppose that b= a r,\n\nc= a r\u00b2,\n\nThen,\n\nThe equations become:\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1)=3( a\u00b2 r\u00b2 +1)=4(a\u00b2 r\u2074 +1),\n\nSo,\n\nLet me set 2(a\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nThen,\n\n3( a\u00b2 r\u00b2 +1)=k \u21d2a\u00b2 r\u00b2 +1= k/3,\n\n4(a\u00b2 r\u2074 +1)=k \u21d2a\u00b2 r\u2074 +1=k/4,\n\nFrom first equation, a\u00b2 = (k/2 -1),\n\nSubstitute into second equation,\n\n(k/2 -1)r\u00b2 +1 =k/3,\n\nSimilarly, into third equation,\n\n(k/2 -1)r\u2074 +1 =k/4,\n\nLet me compute first equation:\n\n(k/2 -1)r\u00b2 +1 =k/3,\n\n(k/2)r\u00b2 -r\u00b2 +1 =k/3,\n\n(k/2 r\u00b2 -k/3 ) =r\u00b2 -1,\n\nk( (r\u00b2/2 -1/3) ) =r\u00b2 -1,\n\nSimilarly, third equation:\n\n(k/2 -1)r\u2074 +1= k/4,\n\n(k/2)r\u2074 -r\u2074 +1= k/4,\n\nk( (r\u2074/2 -1/4 )) =r\u2074 -1,\n\nThus, we have two equations:\n\n1) k ( r\u00b2/2 -1/3 ) =r\u00b2 -1,\n\n2)k ( r\u2074/2 -1/4 ) =r\u2074 -1,\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for k,\n\nk = (r\u00b2 -1)/( r\u00b2/2 -1/3 ) = (r\u00b2 -1)/ ( (3r\u00b2 -2)/6 ) =6(r\u00b2 -1)/(3r\u00b2 -2),\n\nSimilarly, equation 2,\n\nk= (r\u2074 -1)/( (r\u2074/2 -1/4 )) = (r\u2074 -1)/( (2r\u2074 -1)/4 )=4(r\u2074 -1)/(2r\u2074

-2=0,\n\nThus,\n\n-4r\u2074 +6r\u00b2 -2=0,\n\nMultiply both sides by -1,\n\n4r\u2074 -6r\u00b2 +2=0,\n\nLet me set t=r\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n4t\u00b2 -6t +2=0,\n\nSolve for t,\n\nt=(6\u00b1sqrt(36-32))/8=(6\u00b12)/8,\n\nThus,\n\nt=(6+2)/8=1 or t=(6-2)/8=0.5,\n\nThus,\n\nr\u00b2=1 or r\u00b2=0.5,\n\nr\u00b2=1 \u21d2r=1,\n\nr\u00b2=0.5 \u21d2r=\u221a(0.5)=1/\u221a2,\n\nNow, check these solutions.\n\nFirst, r=1,\n\nThen, substituting back,\n\nFrom equation for k,\n\nk=6(r\u00b2 -1)/(3r\u00b2 -2)=6(0)/(1)=0,\n\nBut k must be at least 4, so discard.\n\nSecond, r\u00b2=0.5 \u21d2r=1/\u221a2,\n\nThus,\n\nk=6*(0.5 -1)/(3*0.5 -2)=6*(-0.5)/(1.5 -2)=6*(-0.5)/(-0.5)=6*1=6,\n\nThus, k=6,\n\nThen, compute a,b,c,\n\na\u00b2= (6/2 -1)=3-1=2

Hence, this solution is invalid.\n\nThus, the assumption of geometric progression is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the variables are in arithmetic progression?\n\nSuppose a, b, c are in AP,\n\nThus,\n\nb = (a +c)/2,\n\nBut this may not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables such that a = 2b,\n\nWait, but this is just a shot in the dark.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the following:\n\nThe problem states that the solution is unique, so maybe the variables a, b, c satisfy the following:\n\nLet me consider the three equations:\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1) =3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nLet me set them all equal to k,\n\nThus,\n\na = sqrt(k/2 -1),\n\nb = sqrt(k/3 -1),\n\nc = sqrt(k/4 -1),\n\nAnd ab + bc + ca =1,\n\nLet me consider that this is a system of equations with one variable k,\n\nThus, the equation to solve is:\n\nsqrt(k/2 -1)*sqrt(k/3 -1) + sqrt(k/3 -1)*sqrt(k/4 -1) + sqrt(k/4 -1)*sqrt(k/2 -1) =1,\n\nLet me set t = sqrt(k),\n\nBut not sure,\n\nAlternatively, let me let\u2019s make substitution like x = sqrt(k/2 -1),\n\nThen,\n\nx = a,\n\nThen,\n\nsqrt(k/2 -1)=x \u21d2k/2 -1=x\u00b2 \u21d2k=2(x\u00b2 +1),\n\nThen,\n\nb= sqrt( (2(x\u00b2 +1)/3 -1 )= sqrt( (2x\u00b2 +2 -3)/3 )=sqrt( (2x\u00b2 -1)/3 ),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nc= sqrt( (2(x\u00b2 +1)/4 -1 )=sqrt( (x\u00b2 +1)/2 -1 )=sqrt( (x\u00b2 -1)/2 ),\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nx * sqrt( (2x\u00b2 -1)/3 ) + sqrt( (2x\u00b2 -1)/3 )*sqrt( (x\u00b2 -1)/2 ) + sqrt( (x\u00b2 -1)/2 )*x =1,\n\nThis is the same equation as before, so no progress.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the expression inside the square roots can be written as fractions of squares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assign numbers:\n\nSuppose that k = 6,\n\nThen, as before, sum is 3.12,\n\nToo big.\n\nSuppose k =4.2,\n\nThen, sum is\u22481.038,\n\nClose.\n\nSuppose k=4.18,\n\nSum\u22481.009,\n\nk=4.175,\n\nSum\u22481.002,\n\nk=4.174,\n\nSum\u22481.0,\n\nThus, the exact value would be at k=4.174,\n\nThen, a + b + c \u22481.876,\n\nWait, but this is not a nice number.

+ z\u00b2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)=x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 +2,\n\nSince xy + yz +zx=1,\n\nThus,\n\n(x + y + z)^2 =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 +2,\n\nBut,\n\nx\u00b2 =k/2 -1,\n\ny\u00b2= k/3 -1,\n\nz\u00b2= k/4 -1,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= (k/2 -1)+(k/3 -1)+(k/4 -1)= (k(6+4+3)/12) -3= (13k/12) -3,\n\nThus,\n\n(x + y + z)^2 = (13k/12 -3) +2=13k/12 -1,\n\nThus,\n\n(x + y + z)^2 = (13k/12 -1),\n\nTherefore,\n\na + b + c = sqrt(13k/12 -1),\n\nThus, if we can find k, then we can compute this.\n\nThus, the equation is:\n\nsqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) ) =1,\n\nLet me denote this left side as S(k),\n\nWe need to find k such that S(k)=1,\n\nOnce found, then the answer is sqrt(13k/12 -1),\n\nBut without knowing k, can't compute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps denote the desired answer as S = sqrt(13k/12 -1),\n\nThus, S^2 =13k/12 -1 \u21d2k= (12/13)(S^2 +1),\n\nSubstitute into the equation S(k)=1,\n\nBut this would lead to an equation in S,\n\nBut this might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that S is a rational number,\n\nLet me suppose that S is 2,\n\nThen,\n\nk= (12/13)(4 +1)= (12/13)*5\u22484.615,\n\nWhich we saw earlier gives sum\u22481.569\u22601.\n\nThus, not valid.\n\nSuppose S= sqrt( (13k/12 -1) ),\n\nLet me suppose S= sqrt( (13*(4.174)/12 -1) )=sqrt( (54.262/12 -1) )=sqrt(4.522 -1)=sqrt(3.522)=\u22481.877,\n\nWhich matches the earlier approximation.\n\nThus, the exact value is dependent on the exact k which solves the equation S(k)=1,\n\nSince the problem states that it is unique, and the problem likely expects an exact answer, perhaps there is a trick I missed.\n\nWait, going back to the problem:\n\nThe equations are 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nand ab + bc + ca=1.\n\nLet me consider that variables a, b, c are related through the equations such that:\n\nLet me consider the first three equations:\n\nLet me set 2(a\u00b2 +1) =3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1),\n\nLet me denote this common value as k,\n\nThen,\n\nLet me consider variables x = a\u00b2, y = b\u00b2, z =c\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n2(x+1)=3(y+1)=4(z+1)=k,\n\nand,\n\nsqrt(x y) + sqrt(y z) + sqrt(z x)=1,\n\nWe need to find sqrt(x)+sqrt(y)+sqrt(z).\n\nLet me consider introducing variables as follows:\n\nLet me set,\n\nLet me let\u2019s set u = sqrt(x),\n\nv = sqrt(y),\n\nw = sqrt(z),\n\nThen,\n\nu\u00b2 =x,\n\nv\u00b2 =y,\n\nw\u00b2 = z,\n\nThus,\n\n2(u\u00b2 +1)=3(v\u00b2 +1)=4(w\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nand,\n\nuv +vw +wu=1,\n\nWe need to find u + v + w,\n\nLet me denote the equations:\n\n2(u\u00b2 +1)=k \u2192 u\u00b2 = (k/2 -1),\n\n3(v\u00b2 +1)=k \u2192v\u00b2=(k/3 -1),\n\n4(w\u00b2 +1)=k \u2192w\u00b2=(k/4 -1),\n\nThus,\n\nu = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ),\n\nv = sqrt( (k/3 -1) ),\n\nw = sqrt( (k/4 -1) ),\n\nThus, the equation uv + vw + wu =1,\n\nWhich is the same as before,\n\nThis seems to loop back to the same equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider Lagrange multipliers, setting up the problem as an optimization problem where the function to optimize is a + b + c under constraints,\n\nBut that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the minimum of ab + bc + ca is 1, and the equations are set up such that this is the only solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has an elegant solution involving trigonometric substitutions.\n\nLet me think:\n\nLet me set a = tan \u03b1,\n\nb = tan \u03b2,\n\nc = tan \u03b3,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such that:\n\nLet me let\u2019s consider the following substitution:\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set a = tan \u03b8,\n\nb = tan \u03c6,\n\nc = tan \u03c8,\n\nBut perhaps using some trigonometric identities.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that 2(a\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nThen,\n\na\u00b2 +1 =k/2,\n\nThus,\n\ntan\u03b8 = a \u21d2 sec\u00b2\u03b8 =1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8 =k/2 \u21d2cos\u03b8= sqrt(2/k),\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nThus,\n\ncos\u03b8= sqrt(2/k),\n\ncos\u03c6= sqrt(3/k),\n\ncos\u03c8= sqrt(4/k),\n\nBut then,\n\nab + bc + ca = tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 + tan\u03c6 tan\u03c8 + tan\u03c8 tan\u03b8,\n\nHmm, not sure,\n\nAlternatively,\n\ntan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = (a b),\n\nBut I don't see an identity here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product:\n\nab + bc + ca=1,\n\nand the variables are related through trigonometric functions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables as follows:\n\nLet me set:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set a = sqrt(k/2 -1),\n\nthen,\n\nb= sqrt(k/3 -1),\n\nc= sqrt(k/4 -1),\n\nThen,\n\nThe equation is,\n\nsqrt(k/2 -1)*sqrt(k/3 -1) + sqrt(k/3 -1)*sqrt(k/4 -1) + sqrt(k/4 -1)*sqrt(k/2 -1) =1,\n\nLet me denote,\n\nLet me let\u2019s let\u2019s set t = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ),\n\nThen,\n\nsqrt(A*B) + sqrt(B*C) + sqrt(C*A) =1,\n\nwhere A,B,C are the terms,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the following:\n\nLet me denote,\n\nLet me let\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set u = sqrt(k/2 -1),\n\nv= sqrt(k/3 -1),\n\nw= sqrt(k/4 -1),\n\nThen,\n\nThe equation is uv + vw + wu =1,\n\nAnd we need to find u + v + w,\n\nWith the additional constraints:\n\nu\u00b2 =k/2 -1,\n\nv\u00b2 =k/3 -1,\n\nw\u00b2 =k/4 -1,\n\nThus,\n\nk=2(u\u00b2 +1)=3(v\u00b2+1)=4(w\u00b2+1),\n\nLet me consider that,\n\nFrom the first equation,\n\nk=2u\u00b2 +2,\n\nFrom the second,\n\nk=3v\u00b2 +3,\n\nThus,\n\n2u\u00b2 +2 =3v\u00b2 +3 \u21d22u\u00b2=3v\u00b2 +1,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n3v\u00b2 +3=4w\u00b2 +4 \u21d23v\u00b2=4w\u00b2

becomes,\n\nsqrt(2w\u00b2 +1)*sqrt( (4w\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (4w\u00b2 +1)/3 )*w + w*sqrt(2w\u00b2 +1)=1,\n\nLet me let\u2019s set t =w,\n\nThen,\n\nThe equation is:\n\nsqrt(2t\u00b2 +1)*sqrt( (4t\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (4t\u00b2 +1)/3 )*t + t*sqrt(2t\u00b2 +1)=1,\n\nLet me denote,\n\nLet me let\u2019s set A = sqrt(2t\u00b2 +1),\n\nB = sqrt( (4t\u00b2 +1)/3 ),\n\nThen,\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\nA*B + B*t + A*t =1,\n\nFactor terms:\n\nA*B + t(A + B) =1,\n\nLet me consider that,\n\nLet me set A + B = m,\n\nA*B =n,\n\nThen,\n\nn + t*m =1,\n\nBut also,\n\nWe have,\n\nA\u00b2 =2t\u00b2 +1,\n\nB\u00b2=(4t\u00b2 +1)/3,\n\nThus,\n\nA\u00b2 * B\u00b2 = (2t\u00b2 +1)(4t\u00b2 +1)/3,\n\nAlso,\n\n(A + B)^2 =A\u00b2 +2AB + B\u00b2 =2t\u00b2 +1 + (4t\u00b2 +1)/3 + 2AB,\n\n= (6t\u00b2 +3 +4t\u00b2 +1)/3 +2AB,\n\n= (10t\u00b2 +4)/3 +2AB,\n\nHmm, but this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that t is such that the expression simplifies.\n\nLet me try setting t=1/2,\n\nThen,\n\nA= sqrt(2*(1/4)+1)=sqrt(0.5+1)=sqrt(1.5)=\u22481.2247,\n\nB= sqrt( (4*(1/4)+1)/3 )=sqrt( (1+1)/3 )=sqrt(2/3)=\u22480.8165,\n\nThen,\n\nAB\u22481.2247*0.8165\u22481.0,\n\nB*t\u22480.8165*0.5\u22480.408,\n\nA*t\u22481.2247*0.5\u22480.612,\n\nTotal\u22481.0+0.408+0.612\u22482.02>1,\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, but earlier with t\u22480.2,\n\nThe equation yields around 1.\n\nThus, maybe the exact solution requires numerical methods, and since the problem states that it's unique, the answer is sqrt( (13k/12 -1) ), with k\u22484.174,\n\nBut since we need an exact answer, perhaps the problem is designed such that the minimal solution is when variables are set such that,\n\nLet me consider that,\n\nLet me suppose that,\n\nLet me think of the equations as:\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\n3(b\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\n4(c\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nLet me subtract the first equation minus the second,\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1) -3(b\u00b2

ca\u22481.038,\n\nClose to 1,\n\nPerhaps the problem is designed to have an exact solution at k=6,\n\nBut then the sum is 3.12,\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \\boxed{2}?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}?\n\nBut my calculation says 1.88 which is approximately sqrt(3.53), which is not sqrt(3).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is \\boxed{\\sqrt{2} +1}\u22482.414,\n\nBut that is larger.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a solution where a=1, then,\n\nLet me see,\n\nIf a=1,\n\nThen,\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1)=2*(1+1)=4=k,\n\nThus,\n\nb\u00b2= (4/3 -1)=1/3 \u21d2b=1/sqrt(3),\n\nc\u00b2= (4/4 -1)=0 \u21d2c=0,\n\nBut c must be positive,\n\nThus invalid.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that a=sqrt(2),\n\nThen,\n\nk=2*(2+1)=6,\n\nThus,\n\nb= sqrt( (6/3 -1)=sqrt(1)=1,\n\nc= sqrt( (6/4 -1)=sqrt(0.5)=1/\u221a2,\n\nThus,\n\nab + bc + ca = sqrt(2)*1 +1*(1/\u221a2)+ (1/\u221a2)*sqrt(2)= sqrt(2)+1/\u221a2 +1\u22481.414+0.707+1\u22483.121>1,\n\nNot valid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed to have an answer of \\boxed{2}?,\n\nGiven that my approximation is about 1.88 which is close to 2 but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value is:\n\nGiven that when k=4.174,\n\na + b + c\u22481.877,\n\nWhich is approximately 1.88,\n\nPerhaps the exact value is \\boxed{\\sqrt{3.53}} but this is not a standard form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\u22482.12,\n\nNo, higher than my approximation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires more precise calculation.\n\nWait, let me use Newton-Raphson method on the equation for k.\n\nDefine f(k)=sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/4 -1)(k/2 -1) ) -1,\n\nWe need to find k such that f(k)=0.\n\nLet me take an initial guess k\u2080=4.17,\n\nCompute f(4.17):\n\nFirst term:\n\nsqrt( (2.085-1)(1.39-1) )=sqrt(1.085*0.39)=sqrt(0.423)=\u22480.650,\n\nSecond term:\n\nsqrt( (1.39-1)(0.17/4) )=sqrt(0.39*0.0425)=sqrt(0.016575)=\u22480.128,\n\nThird term:\n\nsqrt( (0.17/4)(2.085-1) )=sqrt(0.0425*1.085)=sqrt(0.0461)=\u22480.214,\n\nTotal\u22480.650+0.128+0.214=0.992,\n\nThus, f(4.17)=0.992-1\u2248-0.008,\n\nCompute f(4.18)=,\n\nFirst term:\n\nsqrt( (2.09-1)(1.393-1)=sqrt(1.09*0.393)=sqrt(0.428)=0.654,\n\nSecond term:\n\nsqrt(0.393*0.045)=sqrt(0.0177)=0.133,\n\nThird term:\n\nsqrt(0.045*1.09)=sqrt(0.049)=0.221,\n\nTotal\u22480.654+0.133+0.221\u22481.008,\n\nThus, f(4.18)=0.008,\n\nThus, between k=4.17 and4.18,\n\nUsing linear approximation,\n\nThe root is at k=4.17 + (0 - (-0.008))/(0.008 - (-0.008))*(0.01)=,\n\nWait, the difference between f(4.18)=0.008 and f(4.17)= -0.008 over interval 0.01,\n\nThus, slope\u2248(0.008 - (-0.008))/0.01=0.16/0.01=16,\n\nThus, to reach f(k)=0 from k=4.17,\n\n\u0394k=0.008/16=0.0005,\n\nThus, k\u22484.17+0.0005\u22484.1705,\n\nThus,\n\nk\u22484.1705,\n\nThus,\n\na= sqrt( (4.1705/2 -1)=sqrt(2.08525-1)=sqrt(1.08525)=\u22481.0417,\n\nb= sqrt( (4.1705/3 -1)=sqrt(1.39016-1)=sqrt(0.39016)=\u22480.6246,\n\nc= sqrt( (4.1705/4 -1)=sqrt(1.0426-1)=sqrt(0.0426)=\u22480.2064,\n\nThus,\n\na + b + c\u22481.0417+0.6246+0.2064\u22481.8727,\n\nThus, approximately 1.8727,\n\nWhich is approximately sqrt(3.506)=1.873,\n\nThus, the exact answer is sqrt( (13k/12 -1) ) with k\u22484.1705,\n\nThus,\n\n13*4.1705/12 -1\u2248(54.2165)/12 -1\u22484.518 -1=3.518,\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(3.518)=\u22481.876,\n\nThis is the exact value,\n\nBut since the problem requires an exact form, and given that my approximation is around 1.87,\n\nPerhaps the exact answer is sqrt( 35/6 ), since,\n\n35/6\u22485.8333, sqrt(35/6)=\u22482.415,\n\nNo,\n\nAlternatively, sqrt(13/7 *k -12),\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is sqrt( (13/12)*4.1705 -1)=sqrt(4.518 -1)=sqrt(3.518),\n\nWhich is irrational,\n\nThus, likely the problem expects the answer as sqrt( (13k/12 -1) ), but since k is the solution to the equation,\n\nBut since the problem states it's unique, perhaps the answer is a simple radical,\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses the following approach:\n\nLet me assume that a, b, c are such that the terms inside the square roots are squares,\n\nLet me suppose that (k/2 -1)=m\u00b2,\n\n(k/3 -1)=n\u00b2,\n\n(k/4 -1)=p\u00b2,\n\nThen,\n\nk=2m\u00b2+2,\n\nk=3n\u00b2+3,\n\nk=4p\u00b2+4,\n\nThus,\n\n2m\u00b2+2=3n\u00b2+3 \u21d22m\u00b2=3n\u00b2+1,\n\n3n\u00b2+3=4p\u00b2+4 \u21d23n\u00b2=4p\u00b2+1,\n\nThus,\n\nLet me set p=1,\n\nThen,\n\n3n\u00b2=4+1=5 \u21d2n\u00b2=5/3 \u21d2n=\u221a(5/3),\n\nThen,\n\n2m\u00b2=3*(5/3)+1=5+1=6 \u21d2m\u00b2=3 \u21d2m=\u221a3,\n\nThus,\n\nk=2*(3)+2=8,\n\nThus,\n\na=\u221a3\u22481.732,\n\nb=\u221a(5/3)\u22481.291,\n\nc=1,\n\nThus,\n\nab + bc + ca\u22481.732*1.291 +1.291*1 +1*1.732\u22482.236+1.291+1.732\u22485.259\u22601,\n\nThus invalid.\n\nTry p=0.5,\n\nThen,\n\n3n\u00b2=4*(0.25)+1=2 \u21d2n\u00b2=2/3 \u21d2n=\u221a(2/3),\n\nThen,\n\n2m\u00b2=3*(2/3)+1=2+1=3 \u21d2m=\u221a(3/2),\n\nThus,\n\nk=2*(3/2)+2=3+2=5,\n\nThus,\n\na= sqrt(3/2)\u22481.225,\n\nb= sqrt(2/3)\u22480.816,\n\nc=0.5,\n\nThus,\n\nab\u22481.0,\n\nbc=0.816*0.5\u22480.408,\n\nca=0.5*1.225\u22480.612,\n\nTotal\u22481.0+0.408+0.612=2.02>1,\n\nStill not 1.\n\nHmm,\n\nAlternatively, p=0.2,\n\nThen,\n\n3n\u00b2=4*(0.04)+1=0.16+1=1.16 \u21d2n\u00b2=0.3867 \u21d2n\u22480.622,\n\nThen,\n\n2m\u00b2=3*(0.3867)+1\u22481.16+1\u22482.16 \u21d2m\u22481.04,\n\nThus,\n\nk=2*(1.08)+2\u22484.16,\n\nThus,\n\na= sqrt( (4.16/2 -1)=sqrt(2.08-1)=sqrt(1.08)=\u22481.04,\n\nb= sqrt(0.3867)=\u22480.622,\n\nc=0.2,\n\nThus,\n\nab\u22481.04*0.622\u22480.647,\n\nbc\u22480.622*0.2\u22480.124,\n\nca\u22480.2*1.04\u22480.208,\n\nTotal\u22480.647+0.124+0.208\u22480.979,\n\nClose to 1.\n\nThus, the value of p is approximately 0.209,\n\nThus, the exact solution is when p= sqrt( (k/4 -1) )=sqrt( (4.1705/4 -1)=sqrt(1.0426 -1)=0.2064,\n\nThus, the exact answer is irrational,\n\nTherefore, the problem must have an exact solution which results in a + b + c= sqrt( (13k/12 -1) ) where k is the solution to the equation,\n\nBut since the problem states the answer is unique and requires an exact form, I must have missed an algebraic approach.\n\nWait, let me try the following:\n\nLet me consider that the equations are:\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nLet me set a = sqrt( (k/2 -1) ),\n\nb = sqrt( (k/3 -1) ),\n\nc = sqrt( (k/4 -1) ),\n\nThe equation ab + bc + ca =1,\n\nLet me consider that,\n\nLet me set variables such that,\n\nLet me set x = sqrt(k/2 -1),\n\ny = sqrt(k/3 -1),\n\nz = sqrt(k/4 -1),\n\nThen the equation is xy + yz + zx =1,\n\nAnd,\n\nWe need to find x + y + z,\n\nNote that:\n\nx\u00b2 =k/2 -1,\n\ny\u00b2 =k/3 -1,\n\nz\u00b2=k/4 -1,\n\nThus,\n\nk =2(x\u00b2 +1)=3(y\u00b2 +1)=4(z\u00b2 +1),\n\nLet me consider the following,\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set,\n\nLet me set,\n\nLet me let\u2019s
