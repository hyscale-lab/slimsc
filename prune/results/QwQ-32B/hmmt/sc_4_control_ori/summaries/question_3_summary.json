      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the smallest possible value of xyz given three equations involving logarithms and exponents. Let me try to parse through this step by step. \n\nThe equations given are:\n\n1. \\( x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} = 2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\)\n2. \\( y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} = 2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6} \\)\n3. \\( z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} = 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10} \\)\n\nHmm, all three variables x, y, z are positive real numbers. The equations involve each variable raised to the logarithm (base 2) of the product of the other two variables. The right-hand sides are products of powers of 2 and 3. I need to find the minimal xyz. \n\nFirst thought: Maybe taking logarithms on both sides of each equation could help? Since dealing with exponents and logs can sometimes be simplified by logarithmic properties. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote each equation with a logarithm. Let's take the logarithm base 2 of both sides of the first equation. \n\nStarting with the first equation:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( x^{\\log _{2}(y z)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^{8} \\cdot 3^{4} \\right) \\)\n\nUsing logarithm power rule: \\( \\log_b(a^c) = c \\log_b a \\), so left side becomes \\( \\log_2(x) \\times \\log_2(yz) \\). \n\nRight side can be split using log(a*b) = log a + log b:\n\n\\( \\log_2(2^8) + \\log_2(3^4) = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nSo first equation becomes:\n\n\\( \\log_2 x \\cdot \\log_2(y z) = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\)  --- (1)\n\nSimilarly, do the same for the second equation:\n\nSecond equation:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( y^{\\log _{2}(z x)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^{9} \\cdot 3^{6} \\right) \\)\n\nLeft side: \\( \\log_2 y \\cdot \\log_2(z x) \\)\n\nRight side: \\( 9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nThus equation (2):\n\n\\( \\log_2 y \\cdot \\log_2(z x) = 9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\) --- (2)\n\nThird equation similarly:\n\n\\( \\log_2 \\left( z^{\\log _{2}(x y)} \\right) = \\log_2 \\left( 2^{5} \\cdot 3^{10} \\right) \\)\n\nLeft: \\( \\log_2 z \\cdot \\log_2(x y) \\)\n\nRight: \\(5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nEquation (3):\n\n\\( \\log_2 z \\cdot \\log_2(x y) = 5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\) --- (3)\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations with log terms. Let me denote variables to simplify.\n\nLet me set variables for the logs:\n\nLet\u2019s let \\( a = \\log_2 x \\), \\( b = \\log_2 y \\), \\( c = \\log_2 z \\). Then, since log_2(xy) = log2 x + log2 y = a + b, similarly for others. \n\nAlso, log2(yz) = b + c, log2(zx) = c + a, log2(xy)=a + b. \n\nAlso, note that x = 2^a, y=2^b, z=2^c. \n\nTherefore, xyz = 2^{a + b + c}\n\nSo our goal is to find the minimal value of 2^{a + b + c}, which is equivalent to minimizing (a + b + c). Wait, since 2^k is an increasing function, the minimal value of xyz is achieved when a + b + c is minimized. So we can instead focus on minimizing a + b + c.\n\nNow, substituting the variables into equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nEquation (1):\n\nOriginal equation (1) was \\( \\log_2 x \\cdot \\log_2(y z) = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nExpressed in terms of a, b, c:\n\n\\( a \\cdot (b + c) = 8 + 4 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nSimilarly equation (2):\n\n\\( b \\cdot (c + a) = 9 + 6 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nEquation (3):\n\n\\( c \\cdot (a + b) = 5 + 10 \\log_2 3 \\)\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations with variables a, b, c. Let me write them again:\n\n1. \\( a(b + c) = 8 + 4k \\) where \\( k = \\log_2 3 \\)\n2. \\( b(c + a) = 9 + 6k \\)\n3. \\( c(a + b) = 5 + 10k \\)\n\nLet me denote \\( k = \\log_2 3 \\) for simplicity. So equations become:\n\n1. \\( a(b + c) = 8 + 4k \\)\n2. \\( b(c + a) = 9 + 6k \\)\n3. \\( c(a + b) = 5 + 10k \\)\n\nNow, the variables a, b, c are real numbers, and we need to solve for them. The goal is to find a + b + c. \n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c. Let me see if I can express the equations in terms of S. \n\nNote that in equation 1, (b + c) = S - a, so equation 1 becomes:\n\n\\( a(S - a) = 8 +4k \\)\n\nSimilarly, equation 2: \\( b(S - b) = 9 +6k \\)\n\nEquation 3: \\( c(S - c) =5 +10k \\)\n\nHmm, so each equation is quadratic in one variable. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps adding all three equations:\n\nLet me compute the sum of the left sides and the sum of the right sides.\n\nLeft sides:\n\na(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b) = a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b)\n\nExpanding each term:\n\n= ab + ac + bc + ba + ca + cb\n\nCombine like terms: ab + ba = 2ab, similarly for others:\n\n= 2ab + 2ac + 2bc = 2(ab + ac + bc)\n\nRight sides:\n\n(8 +4k) + (9 +6k) + (5 +10k) = (8+9+5) + (4k +6k +10k) = 22 + 20k\n\nThus:\n\n2(ab + ac + bc) = 22 + 20k \u21d2 ab + ac + bc = 11 +10k --- (4)\n\nSo now, equation (4) gives us a relation between a, b, c. \n\nWe also have the three original equations:\n\nEquation 1: a(S -a) = 8 +4k \u21d2 aS -a\u00b2 = 8 +4k --- (1a)\n\nEquation 2: bS -b\u00b2 =9 +6k --- (2a)\n\nEquation 3: cS -c\u00b2 =5 +10k --- (3a)\n\nAdditionally, S = a + b + c. \n\nHmm, perhaps we can express each of a, b, c in terms of S and their squares. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that equations (1a), (2a), (3a) can be rearranged as:\n\na\u00b2 - aS + (8 +4k) = 0,\n\nb\u00b2 - bS + (9 +6k) = 0,\n\nc\u00b2 - cS + (5 +10k) = 0.\n\nWait, actually, rearranged:\n\nEquation (1a): a\u00b2 - aS + (8 +4k) =0,\n\nEquation (2a): b\u00b2 - bS + (9 +6k)=0,\n\nEquation (3a): c\u00b2 - cS + (5 +10k)=0.\n\nEach of these is a quadratic equation in a, b, c respectively. \n\nHmm, perhaps the variables a, b, c are roots of the same quadratic equation? Wait, but each has different constants. Maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps there is some symmetry here. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of S as a variable and try to find equations in terms of S.\n\nAlternatively, since S = a + b + c, and ab + ac + bc = 11 +10k,\n\nperhaps we can think of the variables a, b, c as roots of a cubic equation. \n\nLet me recall that for variables a, b, c, the cubic equation would be:\n\nt\u00b3 - S t\u00b2 + (ab + ac + bc) t - abc =0.\n\nBut we don't know abc. Hmm, but perhaps we can find abc somehow?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find S. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider equations (1a), (2a), (3a). Let me denote each equation's left side as quadratics equal to zero. \n\nLet me consider that for each variable, we can write:\n\na\u00b2 = S a - (8 +4k),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = S b - (9 +6k),\n\nc\u00b2 = S c - (5 +10k).\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can find expressions for a\u00b2, b\u00b2, c\u00b2 in terms of S and constants, and then use these in other equations. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2. Since we have ab + ac + bc = 11 +10k,\n\nand (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + ac + bc),\n\nso a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) = S\u00b2 - 2(11 +10k) = S\u00b2 -22 -20k.\n\nAlso, from the above expressions,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = [S a - (8 +4k)] + [S b - (9 +6k)] + [S c - (5 +10k)]\n\n= S(a + b + c) - (8+4k +9+6k +5+10k)\n\n= S\u00b2 - [ (8+9+5) + (4k +6k +10k) ]\n\n= S\u00b2 - (22 +20k)\n\nWhich matches the previous result, so that's consistent. Not sure if this helps yet.\n\nHmm, perhaps let me consider multiplying all three original equations together? Let me see:\n\nOriginal equations (before substituting a,b,c):\n\n\\( x^{\\log_2(yz)} \\times y^{\\log_2(zx)} \\times z^{\\log_2(xy)} = (2^8 3^4)(2^9 3^6)(2^5 3^{10}) \\)\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side first:\n\nMultiply the 2 exponents: 8 +9 +5 =22,\n\nMultiply the 3 exponents: 4+6+10=20,\n\nSo RHS is 2^{22} 3^{20}\n\nNow the left side: Let me see if I can simplify the left side expression.\n\nLeft side: x^{log2(yz)} * y^{log2(zx)} * z^{log2(xy)}\n\nHmm, perhaps using properties of exponents and logarithms. Let me think. \n\nRecall that a^{\\log_b c} = c^{\\log_b a} by logarithmic identity. Wait, is that true?\n\nLet me verify: \n\nTake log base b of both sides:\n\nlog_b(a^{\\log_b c}) = log_b c * log_b a\n\nlog_b(c^{\\log_b a}) = log_b a * log_b c\n\nYes, so they are equal. Therefore, a^{\\log_b c} = c^{\\log_b a}. \n\nTherefore, perhaps we can rewrite each term in the product to see if that helps. Let me see:\n\nFirst term: x^{log2(yz)} = (yz)^{log2 x}\n\nSecond term: y^{log2(zx)} = (zx)^{log2 y}\n\nThird term: z^{log2(xy)} = (xy)^{log2 z}\n\nTherefore, the left side becomes:\n\n(y z)^{log2 x} * (z x)^{log2 y} * (x y)^{log2 z}\n\nMultiply all together:\n\nLet me write exponents as products:\n\nEach term is (product)^{log2 variable}. Let me see:\n\nLet me write each term out:\n\n= y^{log2 x} z^{log2 x} * z^{log2 y} x^{log2 y} * x^{log2 z} y^{log2 z}\n\nNow, group like terms:\n\nFor variable y:\n\nlog2 x (from first term) + log2 y (from second term) + log2 z (from third term) exponent on y.\n\nWait, let me track each variable's exponent:\n\nFor y:\n\n- In the first term: exponent is log2 x (since y has exponent log2 x)\n- In the second term: exponent on y is 0 (since that term is z and x)\nWait, no, in the second term, the first part is (zx)^{log2 y} which is z^{log2 y} * x^{log2 y}. So the exponent on y comes from the third term's y^{log2 z}?\n\nWait, maybe I need to track each variable:\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nLet me write all factors:\n\nFirst term: y^{log2 x} * z^{log2 x}\n\nSecond term: z^{log2 y} * x^{log2 y}\n\nThird term: x^{log2 z} * y^{log2 z}\n\nSo collecting exponents for x:\n\nFrom first term: z^{log2 x} (so exponent on z here, but x is in exponent of z's term? Wait, no, the exponent on z is log2 x.\n\nWait, perhaps better to collect for each variable:\n\nFor variable x:\n\nIn the first term: exponent on x is 0 (only y and z terms)\n\nIn the second term: exponent on x is log2 y (from x^{log2 y})\n\nIn the third term: exponent on x is log2 z (from x^{log2 z})\n\nSo total exponent on x: log2 y + log2 z\n\nSimilarly for y:\n\nIn first term: exponent is log2 x (from y^{log2 x})\n\nIn second term: exponent on y is 0 (only z and x terms)\n\nIn third term: exponent on y is log2 z (from y^{log2 z})\n\nTotal exponent on y: log2 x + log2 z\n\nFor variable z:\n\nFirst term: exponent is log2 x (from z^{log2 x})\n\nSecond term: exponent is log2 y (from z^{log2 y})\n\nThird term: exponent on z is 0 (only x and y terms)\n\nTotal exponent on z: log2 x + log2 y\n\nTherefore, the entire product becomes:\n\nx^{ log2 y + log2 z } * y^{ log2 x + log2 z } * z^{ log2 x + log2 y }\n\nHmm, so each variable is raised to the sum of the logs of the other two variables. \n\nAlternatively, note that log2 y + log2 z = log2(yz), so this can be written as:\n\nx^{ log2(yz) } * y^{ log2(xz) } * z^{ log2(xy) } \n\nWait, but that's exactly the original left-hand side. So that didn't help much. Hmm, but perhaps if we can write the product as:\n\n[ x^{ log2 y } * x^{ log2 z } ] * [ y^{ log2 x } * y^{ log2 z } ] * [ z^{ log2 x } * z^{ log2 y } ]\n\nWhich can be arranged as:\n\n( x^{ log2 y } * y^{ log2 x } ) * ( x^{ log2 z } * z^{ log2 x } ) * ( y^{ log2 z } * z^{ log2 y } )\n\nHmm, perhaps each pair like x^{ log2 y } * y^{ log2 x } can be combined?\n\nYes, using the same identity as before: a^{log_b c} * c^{log_b a} = c^{log_b a} * a^{log_b c} = (a^{log_b c} * c^{log_b a}) \n\nWait, but actually, using the identity mentioned earlier:\n\na^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a}, so x^{log2 y} = y^{log2 x}, so then x^{log2 y} * y^{log2 x} = y^{log2 x} * y^{log2 x} = y^{2 log2 x} ?\n\nWait, no, maybe not. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, x^{log2 y} = y^{log2 x}, so x^{log2 y} * y^{log2 x} = y^{log2 x} * y^{log2 x} = y^{2 log2 x}? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, if x^{log2 y} = y^{log2 x}, then the product x^{log2 y} * y^{log2 x} = y^{log2 x} * y^{log2 x} = (y^{log2 x})^2. Hmm, but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair can be written as (xy)^{log2 x + log2 y} or something else? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me take the entire product expression as:\n\nx^{ log2(y z) } * y^{ log2(z x) } * z^{ log2(x y) } = [x y z]^{ log2(y z) + log2(z x) + log2(x y) } divided by something? Wait, not exactly. Maybe it's better to think in terms of combining the exponents. \n\nAlternatively, let me take the logarithm of the left-hand side. Since the left side is the product of those terms, then:\n\nlog2( left side ) = log2( x^{ log2(yz) } y^{ log2(zx) } z^{ log2(xy) } )\n\n= log2(yz) * log2 x + log2(zx) * log2 y + log2(xy) * log2 z\n\nHmm, but this seems complicated. Wait, but maybe this is equal to log2(RHS) which is log2(2^{22} 3^{20}) =22 +20 log2 3. \n\nTherefore,\n\nlog2(yz) log2x + log2(zx) log2y + log2(xy) log2z =22 +20 log23. \n\nHmm, but that might not be helpful. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since I have the three equations (1a), (2a), (3a), perhaps I can consider solving for a, b, c in terms of S. \n\nFrom equation (1a): a\u00b2 -Sa + (8 +4k)=0,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nEach of these is a quadratic equation. Let me consider that a, b, c are roots of the quadratic equation t\u00b2 - St + C =0, where C is different for each variable. But since each variable has a different constant term, they can't be roots of the same quadratic. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write equations for a, b, c in terms of S and then relate them. Let me try to express a, b, c in terms of S. \n\nLet me consider that from equation (1a):\n\na\u00b2 = Sa - (8 +4k),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb\u00b2 = Sb - (9 +6k),\n\nc\u00b2 = Sc - (5 +10k).\n\nNow, perhaps adding these equations:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S(a + b + c) - ( (8 +4k)+(9 +6k)+(5 +10k) )\n\nBut we already know that a + b + c = S, so:\n\nLeft side: a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab + ac + bc) \n\nRight side: S\u00b2 - (22 +20k)\n\nWhich is consistent with earlier. So that gives us nothing new.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider multiplying equations (1a), (2a), (3a):\n\n(a\u00b2 - Sa +8 +4k)(b\u00b2 - Sb +9 +6k)(c\u00b2 - Sc +5 +10k)=0\n\nWait, no, since each equation is equal to zero, but variables are separate. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the variables a, b, c as variables to be solved. Let me set up the equations again:\n\nWe have:\n\n1. a(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\n2. b(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\n3. c(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nand S =a + b +c,\n\nand ab +ac + bc =11 +10k.\n\nHmm. Let me try to express each variable in terms of S.\n\nLet me consider equation 1:\n\nLet me rearrange equation1:\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + (8 +4k)=0,\n\nThis is quadratic in a, so solution:\n\na = [ S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8 +4k)) ] /2\n\nSimilarly for b and c:\n\nb = [ S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9 +6k)) ] /2,\n\nc = [ S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5 +10k)) ] /2.\n\nHmm, but since a, b, c are real numbers, the discriminants must be non-negative:\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b2 -4*(8 +4k) \u22650,\n\nS\u00b2 -4*(9 +6k) \u22650,\n\nS\u00b2 -4*(5 +10k) \u22650.\n\nThese are constraints on S.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables a, b, c and S, and see if I can form equations that can be solved for S.\n\nLet me denote that:\n\nFrom equation1: a(S -a) =8 +4k \u21d2 aS -a\u00b2 =8+4k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2: bS -b\u00b2 =9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: cS -c\u00b2=5 +10k,\n\nAdding all three equations:\n\n(aS -a\u00b2) + (bS -b\u00b2) + (cS -c\u00b2) = (8 +4k)+(9 +6k)+(5 +10k),\n\nLeft side: S(a + b + c) - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2)\n\nWait, but earlier we had that a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(ab +ac + bc). \n\nSo substituting:\n\nLeft side = S\u00b2 - (S\u00b2 - 2(ab +ac + bc)) = 2(ab +ac + bc)\n\nWhich equals the right side 22 + 20k, so this is consistent with equation (4). So again, no new info.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can find expressions for ab, ac, bc individually?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables p = ab, q = bc, r = ac. Then, ab + bc + ac = 11 +10k,\n\nand S = a + b + c,\n\nand we can also express each equation in terms of these.\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nFrom equation (1): a(b + c) =8 +4k,\n\nBut (b + c) = S - a,\n\nThus equation1: a(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nLet me consider that, for example:\n\nLet me denote equation1: a(S -a) =8+4k,\n\nLet me rearrange this as:\n\naS -a\u00b2 =8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nLet me denote equation1 as:\n\naS -a\u00b2 = K1, where K1 =8+4k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nbS -b\u00b2 = K2 =9+6k,\n\ncS -c\u00b2 = K3=5+10k.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nIf I let variables a, b, c each satisfy equations of the form tS - t\u00b2 = K,\n\nthen each variable is a root of the quadratic equation t\u00b2 -St + K =0,\n\nSo for each variable:\n\na is a root of t\u00b2 - St + K1 =0,\n\nb of t\u00b2 -St + K2 =0,\n\nc of t\u00b2 -St + K3=0.\n\nHmm, so each variable is a root of a different quadratic, but all with the same leading coefficient and same linear term coefficient S.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can consider that, since a, b, c must satisfy these quadratics, their values are determined in terms of S and the constants K1, K2, K3.\n\nThus, for each variable,\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1)] /2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2)] /2,\n\nc = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3)] /2.\n\nTherefore, the variables a, b, c can be expressed in terms of S and the square roots. However, since a, b, c must be real numbers, the discriminants must be non-negative, so S\u00b2 \u22654K1, 4K2,4K3.\n\nBut we need to choose the signs in the square roots. Hmm, perhaps they all have to take the same sign? Not sure yet. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that a, b, c are all less than S? Because since they are part of the sum S = a + b + c, if one variable were greater than S, then the others would have to be negative, but since variables are logarithms of positive real numbers, they can be any real number (since x,y,z are positive, their logs can be any real). Wait, but maybe the variables a,b,c can be positive or negative. Hmm, but since xyz is positive, but individual variables can be negative? For example, x could be between 0 and1, so log2 x would be negative. \n\nHmm, so perhaps a, b, c can be any real numbers, but their sum S is to be minimized. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps they have to be positive? Not sure. Let me think. \n\nWait, the problem states x, y, z are positive real numbers, so their logs can be negative or positive, but the exponents in the original equations must be real, which they are as long as the variables are real. So a, b, c can be any real numbers, but to minimize xyz =2^{a +b +c}, which is minimized when S =a +b +c is as small as possible. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe I can try assuming that all variables are taken with the positive roots? Let's see.\n\nSuppose that for each variable, we take the smaller root? Or the larger root?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set up equations for S. Let me see:\n\nLet me note that:\n\nLet me denote the expressions for a, b, c in terms of S:\n\nLet me define:\n\nsqrt_a = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1),\n\nsqrt_b = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2),\n\nsqrt_c = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3),\n\nThen,\n\na = [S - sqrt_a]/2 or [S + sqrt_a]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nBut the exact choice of sign affects the sum S =a +b +c,\n\nThis might be too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set up equations involving S.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nLet me express a, b, c in terms of S as roots of quadratics:\n\nLet me denote:\n\na = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 - 4K1)] / 2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nb = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2)] /2,\n\nc = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3)] /2,\n\nAssuming that we take the smaller root for each, so that a, b, c are as small as possible. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, since the variables are symmetric in some way, maybe they can be expressed in terms of S such that their sum is S, but it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that the three equations for a, b, c can be combined with the sum S and the sum of products.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nLet me consider the three equations:\n\na(S -a)=K1,\n\nb(S -b)=K2,\n\nc(S -c)=K3,\n\nWe can write each variable as:\n\na = K1 / (S -a),\n\nWait, but that might not help. Alternatively, rearranged as:\n\na(S -a) = K1 \u21d2 aS -a\u00b2 = K1 \u21d2 a\u00b2 -aS + K1 =0,\n\nSame as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of a, b, c as variables and S as a parameter. Let me consider that if we can write each variable in terms of S, then the sum a + b + c = S must hold. \n\nSuppose that for each variable, we have two possible solutions for a, given S. But since all three variables must add up to S, perhaps there's a way to set up an equation for S.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that if I have expressions for a, b, c in terms of S, then plug them into S = a + b +c,\n\nBut this would lead to an equation in S with square roots, which might be complex, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me suppose that for each variable, we take the same sign in front of the square roots. Let me assume that each variable is expressed as:\n\na = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 - 4K1)] / 2,\n\nb = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2)] /2,\n\nc = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3)] /2,\n\nThen, their sum a + b + c should equal S,\n\nTherefore:\n\n[ (S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1)) + (S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2)) + (S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3)) ] /2 = S,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n3S - [ sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3) ] = 2S,\n\nTherefore,\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3) = S,\n\nHmm, okay, so that's an equation in S. \n\nAlternatively, if I had taken the other roots (adding the square roots):\n\na = [S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1)] /2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nThen,\n\nSum would be:\n\n[ (S + sqrt(...) ) + ... ] /2 = S,\n\nWhich would lead to sqrt terms adding up to S as well? Let me check:\n\nSame steps:\n\n(S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1) + S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2) + S + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3)) /2 = S,\n\nTotal numerator: 3S + sum sqrt terms,\n\nThus,\n\n[3S + sum sqrt terms ] /2 = S \u21d2 3S + sum sqrt terms = 2S \u21d2 sum sqrt terms = -S,\n\nBut since sqrt terms are non-negative (as discriminant is S\u00b2 -4K must be non-negative, so sqrt is real and non-negative), their sum can't be negative. Thus that case is invalid. \n\nThus, we must take the minus sign in front of the square roots. \n\nTherefore, the equation to solve is:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3) = S,\n\nWhere K1=8+4k, K2=9+6k, K3=5+10k,\n\nand k = log2 3 \u2248 1.58496,\n\nBut since we need an exact answer, perhaps we can keep k as log2 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a way to find S without plugging in numbers?\n\nAlternatively, let me try to square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square roots, but this might get messy, but let's try.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet A = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1),\n\nB = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2),\n\nC = sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3),\n\nThen the equation becomes A + B + C = S,\n\nAnd we also have:\n\nA\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -4K1,\n\nB\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -4K2,\n\nC\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -4K3,\n\nTherefore, maybe express A, B, C in terms of S and the K's, then plug into the equation A+B+C=S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express each sqrt term as sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K_i), so the equation is:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3) = S,\n\nThis seems difficult, but perhaps substituting numerical values for K1, K2, K3 in terms of k.\n\nLet me note that K1=8+4k,\n\nK2=9+6k,\n\nK3=5+10k,\n\nSo, substituting into the equation:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5+10k)) = S,\n\nHmm, this is quite complex. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem. The three equations given are:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} = 2^8 *3^4,\n\ny^{log2(zx)}=2^9 *3^6,\n\nz^{log2(xy)}=2^5 *3^{10},\n\nPerhaps instead of taking logarithms base 2, maybe taking natural logarithms?\n\nLet me try that approach again, but perhaps in a different way.\n\nLet me take the natural logarithm of both sides of each equation:\n\nEquation1:\n\nln(x^{log2(yz)}) = ln(2^8 3^4),\n\nLeft side: log2(yz) * ln x = (ln(yz)/ln2) * ln x,\n\nRight side: 8 ln2 +4 ln3,\n\nSimilarly for the other equations.\n\nThus equation1 becomes:\n\n[ (ln y + ln z)/ln2 ] * ln x =8 ln2 +4 ln3,\n\nMultiply both sides by ln2:\n\n(ln y + ln z) ln x = (8 ln2 +4 ln3) ln2,\n\nSimilarly, equation2:\n\n(ln z + ln x) ln y = (9 ln2 +6 ln3) ln2,\n\nEquation3:\n\n(ln x + ln y) ln z = (5 ln2 +10 ln3) ln2,\n\nHmm, this might not be better, but perhaps we can denote variables as follows:\n\nLet me set u = ln x, v = ln y, w = ln z,\n\nAlso, let me denote L = ln2, M = ln3,\n\nThen, the equations become:\n\n1. (v + w) u = (8L +4M)L,\n\n2. (w + u) v = (9L +6M)L,\n\n3. (u + v) w = (5L +10M)L,\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of e^{u +v +w }, since xyz = e^{u +v +w}.\n\nHmm, this seems more complicated, but perhaps the variables u, v, w can be related in a system of equations. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation1: (v + w)u = L*(8L +4M) --- (1)\n\nEquation2: (w + u)v = L*(9L +6M) --- (2)\n\nEquation3: (u + v)w = L*(5L +10M) --- (3)\n\nHmm, perhaps adding all three equations:\n\n(v + w)u + (w + u)v + (u + v)w = L*(8L +4M +9L +6M +5L +10M)\n\nLeft side:\n\n(vu + wu) + (wv + uv) + (uw + vw)\n\n= 2uv + 2uw + 2vw = 2(uv + uw + vw)\n\nRight side:\n\nL*( (8+9+5)L + (4+6+10)M ) = L*(22 L +20 M )\n\nTherefore,\n\n2(uv + uw + vw) = L (22 L +20 M )\n\nThus,\n\nuv + uw + vw = (22 L\u00b2 +20 LM)/2 = 11 L\u00b2 +10 LM --- (4)\n\nSo equation (4) gives the sum of products of the variables.\n\nAlso, we have equations (1), (2), (3). Let me denote S = u + v + w. Our goal is to find S to minimize e^{S}.\n\nLet me see if I can express equations in terms of S and the products.\n\nExpressing each equation:\n\nEquation1: u(v + w) = L*(8L +4M),\n\nBut v + w = S - u,\n\nThus,\n\nu(S - u) = L*(8L +4M),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2: v(S - v)= L*(9L +6M),\n\nEquation3: w(S - w)= L*(5L +10M),\n\nSo similar to before, but now in terms of u, v, w.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me let K1 = L*(8L +4M),\n\nK2 = L*(9L +6M),\n\nK3 = L*(5L +10M).\n\nThus, the equations are:\n\nu(S - u) = K1,\n\nv(S - v) = K2,\n\nw(S - w) = K3.\n\nWhich is exactly the same form as before when we used log base 2 variables. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to the same system as before, just with different constants. So perhaps the approach must be similar. \n\nHence, we can proceed as before:\n\nEach variable is a root of a quadratic equation:\n\nu\u00b2 - S u + K1 =0,\n\nv\u00b2 -S v + K2=0,\n\nw\u00b2 -S w + K3=0,\n\nThus, the variables u, v, w are roots of their respective quadratics, and S is the sum of their roots. \n\nTherefore, the same equation applies as before, leading to the equation involving sqrt terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a substitution that can be made here. Maybe assume that variables are proportional to something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that the right-hand sides of the original equations have exponents of 2 and 3. Let me see if the variables x, y, z can be expressed as products of powers of 2 and 3. Let me suppose that x = 2^{a}3^{b}, y=2^{c}3^{d}, z=2^{e}3^{f}. \n\nBut since the equations are multiplicative, perhaps this substitution can separate the exponents of 2 and 3. Let me try this.\n\nLet me suppose that x, y, z can be written as x = 2^{p}3^{q}, y=2^{r}3^{s}, z=2^{t}3^{u}.\n\nThen, let's substitute into the first equation:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} = (2^{p}3^{q})^{log2(yz)}.\n\nFirst compute log2(yz):\n\nlog2(yz) = log2(2^{r}3^{s} *2^{t}3^{u}) = log2(2^{r+t}3^{s+u}) = (r + t) + (s + u) log2 3.\n\nWait, log2(yz) is log2 of a product of 2 and 3 terms. So log2(yz) = log2(2^{r + t}3^{s + u}) = (r + t) + (s + u) log2 3.\n\nTherefore, the exponent in x^{log2(yz)} would be:\n\nlog2(yz) = (r + t) + (s + u) log2 3.\n\nSo, raising x to that power:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} = [2^{p}3^{q}]^{ (r + t) + (s + u) log2 3 }\n\n= 2^{p [ (r + t) + (s + u) log2 3 ]} * 3^{q [ (r + t) + (s + u) log2 3 ]}\n\nHmm, but the right-hand side of the first equation is 2^8 3^4. \n\nThis seems complicated because of the log2 3 terms. Maybe this approach is not the best. Alternatively, perhaps we need to separate the exponents of 2 and 3 in each equation.\n\nLet me think. Each equation's right-hand side is a product of powers of 2 and 3. Let me consider taking the logarithm base 2 of each equation, but also separate the terms involving 3.\n\nWait, perhaps if I take the logarithm base 2 of the first equation:\n\nlog2(x^{log2(yz)}) = log2(2^8 3^4),\n\nLeft side: log2(x) * log2(yz),\n\nRight side: 8 + 4 log2 3,\n\nWhich is exactly what we had before, leading back to the same system. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's no escaping the system of equations involving a, b, c (or u, v, w). \n\nPerhaps instead of working with S, let me consider the variables a, b, c and see if I can find a relationship between them.\n\nRecall that S = a + b + c,\n\nand ab + ac + bc =11 +10k,\n\nand the three equations:\n\na(S - a) =8 +4k,\n\nb(S - b)=9 +6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5 +10k.\n\nLet me denote for each variable,\n\nLet me express each equation as:\n\nFor variable a: aS -a\u00b2 =8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nbS - b\u00b2=9+6k,\n\ncS -c\u00b2=5+10k,\n\nLet me denote these as:\n\nEquation1: a(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nLet me consider the differences between equations.\n\nFor example, Equation2 - Equation1:\n\nb(S -b) -a(S -a) = (9 +6k) - (8 +4k) =1 +2k,\n\nExpand left side:\n\nbS -b\u00b2 -aS +a\u00b2 = S(b -a) + (a\u00b2 -b\u00b2),\n\nFactor:\n\nS(b -a) + (a - b)(a + b) = (b -a)(S - (a + b)),\n\nThus,\n\n(b -a)(S - a -b ) =1 +2k,\n\nBut note that S = a + b +c,\n\nTherefore, S -a -b =c,\n\nThus,\n\n(b -a) c =1 +2k,\n\nSimilarly, Equation3 - Equation1:\n\nc(S -c) -a(S -a)= (5+10k) - (8 +4k)= -3 +6k,\n\nLeft side:\n\ncS -c\u00b2 -aS +a\u00b2= S(c -a) + (a\u00b2 -c\u00b2)= (c -a)(S - (a +c)),\n\nBut S -a -c =b,\n\nThus,\n\n(c -a) b = -3 +6k.\n\nSimilarly, Equation3 - Equation2:\n\nc(S -c) -b(S -b)= (5+10k) - (9 +6k)= -4 +4k,\n\nLeft side:\n\ncS -c\u00b2 -bS +b\u00b2= S(c -b) + (b\u00b2 -c\u00b2)= (c -b)(S - (b +c)),\n\nSince S -b -c =a,\n\nThus,\n\n(c -b)a =-4 +4k,\n\nSo now we have three new equations:\n\n1. (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\n2. (c -a)b = -3 +6k,\n\n3. (c -b)a = -4 +4k,\n\nThese equations might be easier to handle.\n\nLet me denote these as:\n\nEquation A: (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\nEquation B: (c -a)b =-3 +6k,\n\nEquation C: (c -b)a =-4 +4k,\n\nNow, perhaps we can solve these equations for a, b, c in terms of k. Let me see.\n\nFirst, note that k is log2 3, which is a constant (~1.58496), but since we need an exact answer, we can keep it as k.\n\nLet me see if I can express variables in terms of each other.\n\nLet me try to express variables as differences. Let me set:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s denote variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s set D = b -a,\n\nE = c -a,\n\nF = c - b,\n\nBut F = E - D,\n\nHmm, but maybe this complicates.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to solve equations A, B, C:\n\nLet me see if I can express variables in terms of each other.\n\nFrom equation A: (b - a)c =1 +2k,\n\nSimilarly, equation B: (c -a)b = -3 +6k,\n\nEquation C: (c -b)a = -4 +4k,\n\nLet me try to express b -a, c -a, and c -b from these equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nFrom A: (b -a) = (1 +2k)/c,\n\nFrom B: (c -a) = (-3 +6k)/b,\n\nFrom C: (c - b) = (-4 +4k)/a,\n\nBut note that c - b = (c -a) - (b -a),\n\nSo,\n\n(-4 +4k)/a = [ (c -a) - (b -a) ] = (c -a) - (b -a) = \n\n= [ (-3 +6k)/b ] - [ (1 +2k)/c ]\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me see if substituting variables would help.\n\nLet me denote variables like:\n\nLet me let\u2019s suppose that:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s assign variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s call the expressions:\n\nLet\u2019s let P = b - a,\n\nQ = c - a,\n\nR = c - b,\n\nThen, R = Q - P,\n\nAlso, from equations A, B, C,\n\nEquation A: P * c =1 +2k,\n\nEquation B: Q * b = -3 +6k,\n\nEquation C: R * a = -4 +4k,\n\nAlso, note that:\n\nQ = c -a,\n\nand R = c -b = (c -a) - (b -a) = Q - P,\n\nAlso, variables a, b, c are related by S =a +b +c,\n\nBut perhaps this substitution can lead to a system. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of a.\n\nLet me consider expressing b and c in terms of a.\n\nLet me suppose that:\n\nLet me let a be a variable, then express b and c in terms of a using equations A and B.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom equation A: (b - a)c =1 +2k,\n\nFrom equation B: (c -a)b = -3 +6k,\n\nWe can consider these two equations with variables b and c in terms of a.\n\nLet me denote equation A: (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\nEquation B: (c -a)b = -3 +6k,\n\nLet me solve for b and c in terms of a.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set equation A: (b -a)c = C1 =1 +2k,\n\nEquation B: (c -a)b = C2 =-3 +6k,\n\nLet me try to solve for b and c.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet me set variables as x = b, y = c.\n\nThen,\n\n(x -a)y = C1,\n\n(y -a)x = C2,\n\nWe need to solve for x and y given a.\n\nLet me rearrange the first equation: x y -a y = C1,\n\nSecond equation: x y -a x = C2,\n\nSubtract the two equations:\n\n(x y -a y) - (x y -a x) = C1 - C2,\n\n=> -a y +a x = C1 - C2,\n\n=> a(x - y) = C1 -C2,\n\nThus,\n\nx - y = (C1 - C2)/a,\n\nBut note that x - y = (b -c),\n\nWait, but we also have that y -x = c -b = R,\n\nHmm, but maybe this can be helpful.\n\nLet me write:\n\nx - y = (C1 - C2)/a,\n\nAlso, from above,\n\nFrom equation A and B:\n\nLet me add the two equations:\n\n(x -a)y + (y -a)x = C1 + C2,\n\n=> x y -a y + y x -a x = C1 + C2,\n\n=> 2x y -a(x + y) = C1 + C2,\n\nLet me denote S_2 = x + y,\n\nand P_2 = x y,\n\nThen,\n\n2 P_2 -a S_2 = C1 + C2,\n\nAlso, from the previous result,\n\nx - y = (C1 - C2)/a,\n\nLet me denote D = x - y = (C1 -C2)/a,\n\nThen, we can write:\n\nx = y + D,\n\nSubstituting into S_2 = x + y,\n\nS_2 = (y + D) + y = 2y + D,\n\nThus,\n\ny = (S_2 - D)/2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nx = (S_2 + D)/2,\n\nBut perhaps this is getting too involved.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider solving for P_2 and S_2:\n\nWe have:\n\n2 P_2 -a S_2 = C1 + C2,\n\nAnd we also have from equation A and B:\n\nFrom equation A: (x -a)y = C1 \u21d2 x y -a y = C1 \u21d2 P_2 -a y = C1,\n\nFrom equation B: (y -a)x = C2 \u21d2 P_2 -a x = C2,\n\nThus,\n\nFrom equation A: P_2 - a y = C1,\n\nFrom equation B: P_2 - a x = C2,\n\nSubtract these two equations:\n\n- a y + a x = C1 - C2 \u21d2 a(x - y) = C1 - C2,\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nHmm, perhaps this approach is not leading me anywhere. Maybe I need to try plugging in values.\n\nWait, maybe assume that S is a constant and try to find k?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a substitution that can be made. Let me think.\n\nWait, the three equations after differences:\n\nEquation A: (b -a)c =1 +2k,\n\nEquation B: (c -a)b =-3 +6k,\n\nEquation C: (c -b)a =-4 +4k,\n\nLet me try to multiply all three equations together:\n\nLeft side: (b -a)c * (c -a)b * (c -b)a,\n\n= (b -a)(c -a)(c -b) a b c,\n\nRight side: (1+2k)(-3 +6k)(-4 +4k),\n\nHmm, not sure if helpful, but let me compute the left side:\n\nNotice that (b -a)(c -a)(c -b) is a product of differences, but the terms are a bit messy. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet me suppose that I can express b and c in terms of a from equations A and B, then plug into equation C.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFrom equation A: (b - a)c =1 +2k \u21d2 b = ( (1 +2k)/c ) +a,\n\nFrom equation B: (c -a)b =-3 +6k \u21d2 b = ( -3 +6k )/(c -a),\n\nThus, setting the two expressions for b equal:\n\n( (1 +2k)/c ) +a = ( -3 +6k )/(c -a),\n\nThis is getting complex, but let me try to substitute variable names for constants.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set constants as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set C_A =1 +2k,\n\nC_B =-3 +6k,\n\nC_C =-4 +4k,\n\nThen,\n\nFrom equation A: (b -a)c = C_A,\n\nFrom equation B: (c -a)b = C_B,\n\nFrom equation C: (c -b)a = C_C,\n\nSo, equations become:\n\n1. (b -a)c = C_A,\n\n2. (c -a)b = C_B,\n\n3. (c -b)a = C_C,\n\nNow, from equation 1 and 2,\n\nExpress b from equation1:\n\nb = (C_A /c ) +a,\n\nPlug into equation2:\n\n(c -a)[ (C_A/c ) +a ] = C_B,\n\nExpand:\n\n(c -a)(C_A/c ) + (c -a)a = C_B,\n\nFirst term: (C_A/c)(c -a) = C_A - (C_A a)/c,\n\nSecond term: a(c -a) = a c -a\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nC_A - (C_A a)/c + a c -a\u00b2 = C_B,\n\nMultiply all terms by c to eliminate denominators:\n\nC_A c - C_A a + a c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 c = C_B c,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nC_A c - C_A a + a c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 c - C_B c =0,\n\nFactor terms where possible:\n\nTerms with c\u00b2: a c\u00b2,\n\nTerms with c: C_A c - C_B c -a\u00b2 c,\n\nTerms with a: -C_A a,\n\nSo,\n\na c\u00b2 + c( C_A - C_B -a\u00b2 ) - C_A a =0,\n\nThis is a quadratic in c, but with a also present. This seems too tangled.\n\nPerhaps this problem requires a different approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem, maybe taking the product of the three original equations. \n\nOriginal equations:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} =2^8 3^4,\n\ny^{log2(zx)}=2^9 3^6,\n\nz^{log2(xy)}=2^5 3^{10},\n\nMultiply them all together:\n\nLeft side: x^{log2(yz)} * y^{log2(zx)} * z^{log2(xy)}.\n\nAs before, this product can be rewritten using the identity a^{log_b c} = c^{log_b a}:\n\n= (yz)^{log2 x} * (zx)^{log2 y} * (xy)^{log2 z}.\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nxyz^{ log2 x + log2 y + log2 z } ?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, let me think of each term:\n\nFirst term: (yz)^{log2 x} = y^{log2 x} z^{log2 x},\n\nSecond term: (zx)^{log2 y} = z^{log2 y} x^{log2 y},\n\nThird term: (xy)^{log2 z} = x^{log2 z} y^{log2 z},\n\nSo multiplying all together:\n\ny^{log2 x} z^{log2 x} * z^{log2 y} x^{log2 y} * x^{log2 z} y^{log2 z},\n\nGrouping terms:\n\nFor x:\n\nlog2 x from z term + log2 y from second term + log2 z from third term exponent,\n\nWait, no, need to track each variable:\n\nFor variable x:\n\nExponents from first term: 0 (only y and z),\n\nFrom second term: log2 y,\n\nFrom third term: log2 z,\n\nTotal exponent on x: log2 y + log2 z,\n\nSimilarly for y:\n\nFrom first term: log2 x,\n\nFrom second term:0,\n\nFrom third term: log2 z,\n\nTotal exponent on y: log2 x + log2 z,\n\nFor z:\n\nFrom first term: log2 x,\n\nFrom second term: log2 y,\n\nFrom third term:0,\n\nTotal exponent on z: log2 x + log2 y,\n\nSo, the entire product is:\n\nx^{ log2 y + log2 z } * y^{ log2 x + log2 z } * z^{ log2 x + log2 y }.\n\nWhich is the same as before. \n\nThe right side of the product is:\n\n2^{8+9+5} *3^{4+6+10} =2^{22} 3^{20},\n\nSo,\n\nx^{ log2(yz) } y^{ log2(zx) } z^{ log2(xy) } =2^{22} 3^{20},\n\nBut how is this helpful?\n\nAlternatively, take log base 2 of both sides:\n\nlog2(left side) = log2(2^{22} 3^{20}) =22 +20 log2 3.\n\nThe left side log:\n\nlog2( x^{ log2(yz) } y^{ log2(zx) } z^{ log2(xy) } ) \n\n= log2(yz) log2x + log2(zx) log2y + log2(xy) log2z.\n\nWhich is exactly what we had before.\n\nHmm, I feel like I'm going in circles here.\n\nLet me try to think differently. Maybe assume that the minimal xyz occurs when the exponents are in some proportion?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables a, b, c and the equations:\n\na(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5+10k.\n\nLet me consider that each of these equations is a quadratic in the variable, so for each variable, the product of its roots is the constant term. For example, for a, the quadratic is a\u00b2 - Sa + (8+4k)=0, so the product of roots is 8+4k. Similarly for others.\n\nSince S is the same for all three equations, perhaps the variables a, b, c are related such that their quadratics have some symmetry?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three quadratics have a common root? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that all three quadratics have the same root, say S. But then substituting a=S would give S(S -S) =0 =8+4k, which is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the variables a, b, c are the other roots of each other's quadratics? For example, a is a root of the quadratic for b? Not sure.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that S is a variable and try to find its value.\n\nLet me suppose that S is a constant and try to find k such that the equations are consistent. But since k is fixed (as log2 3), that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal S is achieved when the three quadratics have real roots, so their discriminants are non-negative:\n\nS\u00b2 -4*(8+4k) \u22650,\n\nS\u00b2 -4*(9+6k) \u22650,\n\nS\u00b2 -4*(5+10k) \u22650,\n\nThe most restrictive is the middle one since 9+6k is the largest among the constants (since k=log2 3\u22481.58496, so 6k\u22489.5, so 9+6k\u224818.5), so 4*(9+6k)=36+24k. So the second inequality requires S\u00b2 \u226536+24k,\n\nSimilarly, the first requires S\u00b2 \u226532 +16k,\n\nThird requires S\u00b2 \u226520 +40k,\n\nSince k=log2 3\u22481.585, then 40k\u224863.4, so 20+40k\u224883.4,\n\nThus the third inequality requires S\u00b2\u226583.4, which is the largest.\n\nWait, so the most restrictive condition is the third equation:\n\nS\u00b2 \u22654*(5+10k)=20 +40k,\n\nThus, S must be at least sqrt(20 +40k).\n\nBut we are to minimize S, so perhaps the minimal S is sqrt(20 +40k)? But that may not satisfy the other inequalities.\n\nWait, but if we set S\u00b2 =20 +40k,\n\nthen check the first two inequalities:\n\nFirst: 20+40k vs 32+16k,\n\n20+40k \u226532+16k \u21d2 24k \u226512 \u21d2k\u22650.5,\n\nWhich is true since k=log2 3\u22481.58496,\n\nSimilarly, second inequality: 20+40k vs 36+24k,\n\n20+40k \u226536+24k \u21d216k \u226516 \u21d2k\u22651,\n\nWhich is also true, since k>1.5.\n\nThus, S_min is sqrt(20+40k). But is this achievable?\n\nIf S = sqrt(20+40k), then the third quadratic has a repeated root, so c would be S/2,\n\nBut then need to see if the other equations can be satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal S is when all three discriminants are zero, but that would require S\u00b2=4K1,4K2,4K3, which is only possible if K1=K2=K3, which is not the case here.\n\nThus, the minimal S is sqrt(20 +40k), but we need to verify if there exists a solution with this S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps setting S equal to sqrt(20 +40k) and see if the other equations can be satisfied.\n\nBut this might not lead to a solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to look for a solution where S is such that all three equations are satisfied.\n\nLet me try to assume that a, b, c are proportional to the constants on the right-hand sides.\n\nLooking at the equations:\n\nEquation1: a(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nNotice that the right-hand sides are 8+4k, 9+6k, 5+10k. \n\nLet me see if these can be expressed as multiples of (something). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps if we let the variables a, b, c be proportional to the coefficients of 2 and 3 in the original equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such that:\n\nLet me suppose that the variables a, b, c are of the form:\n\na = m log2 2 + n log2 3,\n\nWait, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the RHS of the equations are combinations of 2 and 3, maybe we can assume that a and b and c have components related to logarithms of 2 and 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me think of k as a variable and try to solve for S.\n\nLet me think of the equations in terms of k.\n\nWe have three equations:\n\na(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nand also,\n\nab +ac + bc =11+10k,\n\nand a +b +c =S.\n\nLet me consider that the first three equations can be rewritten as:\n\naS - a\u00b2 =8+4k,\n\nbS -b\u00b2 =9+6k,\n\ncS -c\u00b2 =5+10k,\n\nThen, adding them up gives:\n\nS(a +b +c) - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) =22 +20k,\n\nWhich we know equals 2(ab +ac + bc)=22 +20k,\n\nWhich is consistent.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can write each of the equations as:\n\na\u00b2 = Sa - (8+4k),\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nThen, the product abc can be expressed in terms of S and the constants, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me consider the three equations:\n\na\u00b2 = Sa - (8+4k),\n\nb\u00b2 = Sb - (9+6k),\n\nc\u00b2 = Sc - (5+10k).\n\nLet me consider multiplying all three equations:\n\na\u00b2 b\u00b2 c\u00b2 = (Sa - (8+4k))(Sb - (9+6k))(Sc - (5+10k)),\n\nBut this seems too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the variables a, b, c are linear functions of S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the equations as linear in k.\n\nLooking at the equations:\n\nEquation1: a(S - a) =8 +4k,\n\nEquation2: b(S -b)=9 +6k,\n\nEquation3: c(S -c)=5 +10k,\n\nLet me rearrange each equation to solve for k:\n\nFrom equation1:\n\n4k = a(S -a) -8 \u21d2k = [a(S -a) -8]/4,\n\nEquation2:\n\n6k = b(S -b) -9 \u21d2k = [b(S -b) -9]/6,\n\nEquation3:\n\n10k =c(S -c) -5 \u21d2k= [c(S -c) -5]/10,\n\nSince all equal to k, we can set them equal to each other:\n\n[a(S -a) -8]/4 = [b(S -b) -9]/6,\n\nand,\n\n[a(S -a) -8]/4 = [c(S -c) -5]/10,\n\nLet me take the first equality:\n\nMultiply both sides by 12 to eliminate denominators:\n\n3[a(S -a) -8] =2[ b(S -b) -9 ],\n\nExpand:\n\n3a(S -a) -24 =2b(S -b) -18,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n3a(S -a) -2b(S -b) -6 =0,\n\nSimilarly, expand terms:\n\n3aS -3a\u00b2 -2bS +2b\u00b2 -6 =0,\n\nGroup terms:\n\n(3aS -2bS) + (-3a\u00b2 +2b\u00b2) -6 =0,\n\nFactor S:\n\nS(3a -2b) + (-3a\u00b2 +2b\u00b2) -6 =0,\n\nHmm, perhaps express in terms of variables.\n\nAlternatively, this might not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, let me also consider the second equality between equations1 and3:\n\n[a(S -a) -8]/4 = [c(S -c) -5]/10,\n\nMultiply both sides by 20:\n\n5[a(S -a) -8] =2[c(S -c) -5],\n\nExpand:\n\n5a(S -a) -40 =2c(S -c) -10,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n5a(S -a) -2c(S -c) -30 =0,\n\nExpand:\n\n5aS -5a\u00b2 -2cS +2c\u00b2 -30 =0,\n\nGroup:\n\nS(5a -2c) + (-5a\u00b2 +2c\u00b2) -30 =0,\n\nHmm, this is getting too convoluted. \n\nPerhaps I need to consider that this problem might have symmetric solutions or some substitution that I'm missing. Let me think of the original equations again.\n\nThe original equations are:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} =2^8 3^4,\n\ny^{log2(zx)}=2^9 3^6,\n\nz^{log2(xy)}=2^5 3^{10},\n\nSuppose that xyz = T, which we want to minimize. \n\nLet me see if I can express each equation in terms of T.\n\nTake the first equation:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} =2^8 3^4,\n\nBut yz = (T)/x,\n\nSo log2(yz) = log2(T/x) = log2 T - log2 x,\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nx^{ log2 T - log2 x } =2^8 3^4,\n\n= x^{ log2 T } / x^{ log2 x } =2^8 3^4,\n\nSimilarly, note that x^{ log2 x } =2^{ (log2 x)^2 }, since x^{ log2 x } = (2^{log2 x})^{ log2 x } =2^{ (log2 x)^2 }.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx^{ log2 T } / 2^{ (log2 x)^2 } =2^8 3^4,\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, taking log base 2 of both sides:\n\nlog2( x^{ log2(yz) } ) = log2(2^8 3^4),\n\nWhich we have done before. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that log2(yz) is log2 T - log2 x,\n\nSo the left side exponent is log2 T - log2 x,\n\nThus,\n\nx^{ log2 T - log2 x } =2^8 3^4,\n\nLet me denote that exponent:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set A = log2 T,\n\nand B = log2 x,\n\nSimilarly, log2 y = C,\n\nlog2 z = D,\n\nSo, A = B + C + D,\n\nThen, the first equation exponent is A - B,\n\nSo the first equation becomes:\n\n2^{B(A - B)} =2^8 3^4,\n\nWait, because x =2^B,\n\nSo x^{A - B} = (2^B)^{A - B} =2^{B(A - B)}.\n\nThus, the first equation is:\n\n2^{B(A - B)} =2^8 3^4,\n\nSimilarly, second equation:\n\ny^{ log2(zx) } =2^9 3^6,\n\nlog2(zx)= log2 z + log2 x = D + B,\n\nThus exponent is log2(zx)= D + B,\n\nBut y =2^C,\n\nThus,\n\n2^{C(D + B)} =2^9 3^6,\n\nThird equation:\n\nz^{ log2(xy) } =2^5 3^{10},\n\nlog2(xy)=B +C,\n\nThus,\n\n2^{D(B + C)} =2^5 3^{10},\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. 2^{B(A - B)} =2^8 3^4,\n\n2. 2^{C(B + D)} =2^9 3^6,\n\n3. 2^{D(B + C)} =2^5 3^{10},\n\nAnd A = B + C + D,\n\nWe need to find minimal T =2^{A} (since T = xyz =2^{B + C + D}),\n\nHmm, perhaps taking logarithms again, but in terms of base 2 and base 3.\n\nLet me take log base 2 of each equation:\n\nEquation1:\n\nlog2(2^{B(A - B)}) = log2(2^8 3^4),\n\nLeft side: B(A - B),\n\nRight side:8 +4 log2 3,\n\nThus,\n\nB(A - B) =8 +4k where k=log2 3,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nEquation2:\n\nC(B + D) =9 +6k,\n\nEquation3:\n\nD(B + C) =5 +10k,\n\nAnd A = B + C + D,\n\nThis is exactly the same system as before with a = B, b=C, c=D, S=A.\n\nThus, we come back to the same system.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we need to consider that the minimal S is the minimal value such that the system has a real solution.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the minimal S is achieved when the variables a,b,c are set such that their quadratics are tangent (discriminant zero). But this requires that each quadratic has discriminant zero, but that would require all three equations having S\u00b2 =4K_i,\n\nWhich is only possible if K1=K2=K3, which they are not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set two discriminants to zero and see if the third holds?\n\nSuppose that two of the quadratics have zero discriminant.\n\nFor example, set discriminant for a's equation to zero:\n\nS\u00b2 -4*(8 +4k)=0 \u21d2S=2\u221a(8+4k),\n\nThen discriminant for b's equation would be S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k)= 4*(8+4k) -4*(9+6k)= 4*( -1 -2k ), which is negative since k>0 \u21d2 no real solution. Thus invalid.\n\nSimilarly for others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal S is when all three discriminants are positive, and the system has real solutions.\n\nSince the most restrictive is the third discriminant requiring S\u00b2\u226520+40k,\n\nLet me compute that value numerically to see:\n\nk=log2 3 \u22481.58496,\n\nThus,\n\n20 +40k \u224820 +40*1.58496\u224820+63.398\u224883.398,\n\nThus S must be at least sqrt(83.398)\u22489.132,\n\nBut we need an exact expression, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the minimal S is the minimal real solution to the equation:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(8+4k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(9+6k)) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*(5+10k)) = S,\n\nThis is an equation in S with k=log2 3.\n\nPerhaps the minimal S is when the three terms on the left are as small as possible while summing to S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a smart substitution or observation.\n\nWait, let me consider that the equations for a, b, c can be expressed as:\n\na = [S \u00b1 sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1)]/2,\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nAssuming we take the smaller roots (to get smaller variables, leading to smaller S? Not sure).\n\nThen, the sum a + b + c = S,\n\nThus,\n\n[ (S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1))/2 + (S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2))/2 + (S - sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3))/2 ] = S,\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n[3S - (sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3))]/2 = S,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n3S - (sqrt terms) = 2S \u21d2 sqrt terms = S,\n\nWhich is the same equation as before.\n\nThus, we must solve:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4K1) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K2) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K3) = S,\n\nWith K1=8+4k, K2=9+6k, K3=5+10k, and k=log23.\n\nThis is a tough equation to solve algebraically. Perhaps we can assume that the minimal S is when the three terms sqrt(S\u00b2 -4K_i) are proportional to something.\n\nAlternatively, let me make a substitution: Let\u2019s let\u2019s set S = t,\n\nThen, the equation is:\n\nsqrt(t\u00b2 -4K1) + sqrt(t\u00b2 -4K2) + sqrt(t\u00b2 -4K3) = t,\n\nLet me try plugging in t = sqrt(20+40k):\n\nsqrt(20+40k -4K1) + sqrt(20+40k -4K2) + sqrt(0) = sqrt(20+40k),\n\nBut sqrt(0)=0,\n\nCompute 20+40k -4K1 =20+40k -4*(8+4k)=20+40k-32-16k=8+24k,\n\nSimilarly 20+40k -4K2=20+40k -4*(9+6k)=20+40k -36 -24k= -16 +16k,\n\nWhich may be negative if 16k <16, but k=log23\u22481.584 which is less than 1? No, 1.584>1, so 16k\u224825.35 which is >16,\n\nThus -16+16k\u22489.35,\n\nThus, sqrt(8+24k) + sqrt(-16+16k) +0 \u2248 sqrt(8+24*1.584)+sqrt(-16+16*1.584),\n\nCompute:\n\n24k\u224824*1.584\u224838.02,\n\n8+38.02\u224846.02,\n\nsqrt(46.02)\u22486.78,\n\n16k\u224825.35,\n\n-16+25.35\u22489.35,\n\nsqrt(9.35)\u22483.06,\n\nTotal left side\u22486.78+3.06\u22489.84,\n\nWhile sqrt(20+40k)=sqrt(83.398)\u22489.13,\n\nSo left side \u22489.84>9.13, thus not equal. Thus, S must be larger than sqrt(20+40k).\n\nHmm, so maybe we can try to solve numerically.\n\nLet me approximate with k=log23\u22481.58496,\n\nThus,\n\nK1=8+4*1.58496\u22488+6.3398\u224814.3398,\n\nK2=9+6*1.58496\u22489+9.5098\u224818.5098,\n\nK3=5+10*1.58496\u22485+15.8496\u224820.8496,\n\nThus,\n\nEquation to solve:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -4*14.3398) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*18.5098) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -4*20.8496) = S,\n\nCompute 4*K1\u224857.359,\n\n4*K2\u224874.039,\n\n4*K3\u224883.398,\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 -57.359) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -74.039) + sqrt(S\u00b2 -83.398) = S,\n\nWe need S\u00b2\u226583.398 \u21d2S\u22659.132,\n\nLet me try S=10,\n\nLeft side:\n\nsqrt(100 -57.359)=sqrt(42.641)=6.53,\n\nsqrt(100-74.039)=sqrt(25.961)=5.095,\n\nsqrt(100-83.398)=sqrt(16.602)=4.075,\n\nTotal:6.53+5.095+4.075\u224815.7,\n\nBut S=10, so LHS\u224815.7\u226010.\n\nToo big.\n\nTry S=15,\n\nLeft terms:\n\nsqrt(225-57.359)=sqrt(167.641)=12.95,\n\nsqrt(225-74.039)=sqrt(150.96)=12.29,\n\nsqrt(225-83.398)=sqrt(141.602)=11.9,\n\nTotal:12.95+12.29+11.9\u224837.14 vs S=15, still way off.\n\nHmm, maybe S needs to be much bigger?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Because when S increases, each sqrt term approaches S, so the left side approaches 3S, so the equation sqrt terms \u2248 3S \u2248 S \u21d2 3S \u2248S \u21d2 only at S=0, which is impossible. Thus, there must be a minimum S where the left side equals S.\n\nWait, but when S approaches infinity:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2 - ...) ~ S - (K_i)/(S),\n\nSo each sqrt term is ~ S - (2K_i)/S,\n\nThus, sum is 3S - (2/ S)(K1 +K2 +K3),\n\nSet equal to S:\n\n3S - (2/S)(sum K_i) =S,\n\n2S = (2/S)(sum K_i),\n\n2S\u00b2 = sum K_i,\n\nThus, as S approaches infinity, the equation would require S\u00b2 = (sum K_i)/2,\n\nBut sum K_i=14.3398+18.5098+20.8496\u224853.699,\n\nThus, S\u00b2\u224826.85 \u21d2S\u22485.18, but this contradicts earlier constraints that S must be over 9.\n\nHmm, so maybe the equation has no solution? But the problem states that x,y,z are positive real numbers, so there must be a solution.\n\nI must have made a mistake in the approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to use the original variables and try to find a relationship.\n\nLet me think back to the variables a,b,c and S.\n\nWe have:\n\nab +ac + bc =11 +10k,\n\nand also:\n\na(S -a)=8+4k,\n\nb(S -b)=9+6k,\n\nc(S -c)=5+10k,\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nLet me denote the three equations as:\n\na(S -a)=8+4k \u21d2a\u00b2 = Sa - (8+4k),\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nThen,\n\nLet me compute:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S(a +b +c) - (8+4k +9+6k +5+10k),\n\n= S\u00b2 - (22 +20k),\n\nAlso,\n\n(ab +ac + bc)=11 +10k,\n\nThus,\n\n(a +b +c)^2 = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2(ab +ac + bc),\n\nWhich is,\n\nS\u00b2 = [S\u00b2 -22 -20k] +2*(11 +10k),\n\n= S\u00b2 -22-20k +22 +20k,\n\n= S\u00b2,\n\nWhich checks out, so no new information.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the minimal xyz is achieved when variables are set in a way that the product is minimized. Maybe assume that one of the variables is zero? But x, y, z must be positive, so logs can be negative but not zero.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal product occurs when a,b,c are such that the product xyz is minimized, which would correspond to the minimal S.\n\nAlternatively, I think the problem requires a substitution that I\u2019m missing.\n\nWait, let me think of the variables a,b,c as exponents in log2, so perhaps consider that:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set variables:\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set u = log2 x,\n\nv = log2 y,\n\nw = log2 z,\n\nThen the equations become:\n\nu(log2(yz)) = log2 (2^8 3^4),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nv(log2(zx)) = log2 (2^9 3^6),\n\nw(log2(xy)) = log2(2^5 3^{10}),\n\nWait, but log2(yz)=log2 y + log2 z = v +w,\n\nSimilarly:\n\nFirst equation: u(v +w)= log2(2^8 3^4)=8 +4 log23,\n\nSecond equation: v(w +u)=9 +6 log2 3,\n\nThird equation: w(u +v)=5 +10 log23,\n\nThis is exactly the same as before with a=u, b=v, c=w, and S=u+v+w.\n\nThus, this approach doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the variables are multiples of log23 and log22?\n\nLet me think of variables a,b,c as linear combinations of log22 and log23. Let me set:\n\nLet me let\u2019s assume a = m +n log23,\n\nb = p +q log23,\n\nc = r +s log23,\n\nBut this might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, since the right-hand sides have terms with k=log23,\n\nmaybe set variables such that a = \u03b1 + \u03b2 k,\n\nSimilarly for b and c,\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set a = \u03b11 + \u03b21 k,\n\nb = \u03b12 + \u03b22 k,\n\nc = \u03b13 + \u03b23 k,\n\nThen, substituting into the equations:\n\nFor equation1:\n\na(S -a) =8 +4k,\n\nWhich is:\n\n(\u03b11 + \u03b21 k)(S - \u03b11 - \u03b21 k) =8 +4k,\n\nExpand:\n\n\u03b11(S - \u03b11 - \u03b21k) + \u03b21k(S - \u03b11 - \u03b21k) =8 +4k,\n\nSimilarly for other equations. This might allow separating terms with and without k.\n\nLet me attempt this.\n\nLet me denote S = \u03b1_S + \u03b2_S k,\n\nThen, the first equation becomes:\n\n(\u03b11 + \u03b21 k)( (\u03b1_S + \u03b2_S k) - \u03b11 - \u03b21 k ) =8 +4k,\n\nSimplify the argument inside the second parenthesis:\n\n= \u03b1_S + \u03b2_S k - \u03b11 - \u03b21 k = (\u03b1_S - \u03b11) + (\u03b2_S - \u03b21)k,\n\nThus,\n\n(\u03b11 + \u03b21 k)[ (\u03b1_S - \u03b11) + (\u03b2_S - \u03b21)k ] =8 +4k,\n\nMultiply out:\n\n\u03b11*(\u03b1_S - \u03b11) + \u03b11*(\u03b2_S - \u03b21)k + \u03b21 k*(\u03b1_S - \u03b11) + \u03b21 k*(\u03b2_S - \u03b21)k =8 +4k,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nConstant terms (without k):\n\n\u03b11(\u03b1_S - \u03b11),\n\nTerms with k^2:\n\n\u03b21*(\u03b2_S - \u03b21)k^2,\n\nTerms with k:\n\n[ \u03b11(\u03b2_S - \u03b21) + \u03b21(\u03b1_S - \u03b11) ]k,\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n\u03b11(\u03b1_S - \u03b11) + [ \u03b11(\u03b2_S - \u03b21) + \u03b21(\u03b1_S - \u03b11) ]k + \u03b21(\u03b2_S - \u03b21)k\u00b2 =8 +4k,\n\nSince k=log23 is a constant (~1.58496), but to have this equality for all terms, the coefficients of like terms must be equal on both sides.\n\nThe right-hand side is 8 +4k +0k\u00b2,\n\nThus, equate coefficients:\n\nFor the constant term (k^0):\n\n\u03b11(\u03b1_S - \u03b11) =8,\n\nFor the coefficient of k:\n\n\u03b11(\u03b2_S - \u03b21) + \u03b21(\u03b1_S - \u03b11) =4,\n\nFor the coefficient of k\u00b2:\n\n\u03b21(\u03b2_S - \u03b21) =0,\n\nSimilarly, this must hold for all three equations. This gives a system of equations for each variable. \n\nStarting with the third equation for the k\u00b2 term:\n\n\u03b21(\u03b2_S - \u03b21)=0,\n\nThis implies either \u03b21=0 or \u03b2_S=\u03b21,\n\nSimilarly for the other variables.\n\nAssuming that \u03b2_S is the same for all equations (since S is a single variable), this approach might require that either \u03b21=0 or \u03b2_S=\u03b21, and similarly for \u03b22 and \u03b23.\n\nSuppose that \u03b2_S is a common value, and each \u03b2_i is either 0 or \u03b2_S.\n\nLet me consider that \u03b2_S is a common value.\n\nLet me suppose that for each variable, either \u03b2_i =0 or \u03b2_i=\u03b2_S.\n\nTo minimize the number of variables, perhaps assume that \u03b2_S is a constant, and each variable has either \u03b2_i=0 or \u03b2_i=\u03b2_S.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that all variables have \u03b2_i=\u03b2_S,\n\nThen \u03b2_S -

Suppose that one of the variables is equal to another variable plus the third.\n\nFor instance, suppose that a =b +c,\n\nThen the first quadratic would have a root at a and at S -a =b +c =a,\n\nThus, the quadratic would have a double root at a,\n\nThus discriminant zero,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 -4K1=0,\n\nSo S=2\u221aK1,\n\nSimilarly, if a =b +c,\n\nThen,\n\na = S -a \u21d22a=S,\n\nThus,\n\na= S/2,\n\nBut then,\n\na\u00b2 - Sa + K1=0,\n\n(S/2)^2 -S*(S/2)+K1=0,\n\nS\u00b2/4 -S\u00b2/2 +K1=0 \u21d2-S\u00b2/4 +K1=0 \u21d2K1=S\u00b2/4,\n\nThus,\n\nS=2\u221aK1,\n\nWhich requires that a = S/2 and S=2\u221aK1,\n\nSimilarly, if any of the variables equals the sum of the other two, the quadratic would have a double root.\n\nBut we need to check if such a solution satisfies all equations.\n\nSuppose that a =b +c,\n\nThen, S= a +b +c= a +a=2a,\n\nThus,\n\nS=2a,\n\nThus,\n\nFrom the first quadratic:\n\na(S -a)=a(a)=a\u00b2=K1,\n\nThus,\n\na=\u221aK1,\n\nThus,\n\nS=2\u221aK1,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom the second equation,\n\nb(S -b)=K2,\n\nBut S -b= a +c= (b +c) +c= b +2c,\n\nWait, since a =b +c,\n\nThus,\n\nS -b =a +c= (b +c)+c= b +2c,\n\nThus,\n\nb*(b +2c)=K2,\n\nBut since S=2a=2(b +c),\n\nThus, c=(S/2 -b),\n\nSo,\n\nb*(b +2*(S/2 -b))=b*(b +S -2b)=b*(S -b)=K2,\n\nWhich is exactly the second equation: b(S -b)=K2,\n\nThus, this holds.\n\nSimilarly for the third equation:\n\nc(S -c)=K3,\n\nSince S -c =a +b,\n\nBut a =b +c,\n\nThus,\n\nS -c = (b +c) +b=2b +c,\n\nBut S=2a=2(b +c),\n\nThus,\n\n2b +c= S -c =2(b +c) -c=2b +c,\n\nThus,\n\nc*(2b +c)=K3,\n\nBut,\n\nLet me express in terms of S and b:\n\nc= (S/2) -b,\n\nThus,\n\nc*(2b +c)= (S/2 -b)(2b + S/2 -b)= (S/2 -b)(b + S/2)= (S/2)^2 -b\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n(S/2)^2 -b\u00b2 =K3,\n\nBut from second equation,\n\nb(S -b)=K2,\n\nS -b=2a -b=2(b +c) -b= b +2c,\n\nBut c= (S/2 -b),\n\nThus,\n\nb*(S -b)=b*(S -b)=K2,\n\nBut also,\n\nFrom the first equation, a\u00b2=K1,\n\nAnd a= S/2,\n\nSo,\n\n(S/2)^2 =K1,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2/4 =K1,\n\nThus,\n\n(S/2)^2 -b\u00b2 =K3 \u21d2K1 -b\u00b2=K3 \u21d2b\u00b2=K1 -K3,\n\nFrom second equation,\n\nb*(S -b)=K2,\n\nBut S -b=2a -b= S -b,\n\nExpressed as:\n\nb*(S -b)=K2,\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nbS -b\u00b2 =K2,\n\nBut b\u00b2=K1 -K3,\n\nThus,\n\nbS - (K1 -K3) =K2 \u21d2bS=K2 +K1 -K3,\n\nThus,\n\nb= (K2 +K1 -K3)/S,\n\nBut S=2\u221aK1,\n\nThus,\n\nb= (K1 +K2 -K3)/(2\u221aK1),\n\nSimilarly,\n\nc= S/2 -b= \u221aK1 - [(K1 +K2 -K3)/(2\u221aK1)]= [2K1 -K1 -K2 +K3]/(2\u221aK1)= (K1 -K2 +K3)/(2\u221aK1),\n\nThus,\n\nNow, with K1=8+4k,\n\nK2=9+6k,\n\nK3=5+10k,\n\nCompute:\n\nK1 +K2 -K3= (8+4k)+(9+6k)-(5+10k)=12 +0k=12,\n\nThus,\n\nb=12/(2\u221aK1)=6/\u221aK1,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nK1 -K2 +K3= (8+4k)-(9+6k)+(5+10k)=4 +8k,\n\nThus,\n\nc=(4+8k)/(2\u221aK1)= (2+4k)/\u221aK1,\n\nNow, check whether these values satisfy the third equation,\n\nc*(S -c)=K3,\n\nFirst compute S=2\u221aK1,\n\nS -c=2\u221aK1 -c=2\u221aK1 - (2+4k)/\u221aK1,\n\nMultiply c*(S -c):\n\nc*(S -c)= [ (2+4k)/\u221aK1 ] * [2\u221aK1 - (2+4k)/\u221aK1 ] \n\n= [ (2+4k)/\u221aK1 ] * [ (2K1 - (2+4k)) /\u221aK1 ]\n\n= (2+4k)(2K1 -2 -4k)/K1,\n\nThis should equal K3=5+10k,\n\nLet me compute this expression,\n\nFirst compute 2K1 -2 -4k,\n\n2K1=2*(8+4k)=16+8k,\n\nThus,\n\n2K1 -2 -4k=16+8k -2 -4k=14+4k,\n\nThus,\n\nNumerator: (2+4k)(14+4k),\n\nDenominator: K1,\n\nThus,\n\nThe product is (2+4k)(14+4k)/(8+4k),\n\nFactor numerator:\n\n2+4k=2(1+2k),\n\n14+4k=2*(7+2k),\n\nThus,\n\nNumerator=2*2*(1+2k)(7+2k)=4*(7+15k +4k\u00b2),\n\nDenominator=8+4k=4*(2 +k),\n\nThus,\n\nThe product is 4*(7+15k +4k\u00b2)/[4*(2 +k)] = (7+15k +4k\u00b2)/(2 +k),\n\nThis should equal K3=5+10k,\n\nThus,\n\n(7+15k +4k\u00b2)/(2 +k)=5+10k,\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n7+15k +4k\u00b2=(5+10k)(2 +k)=10+5k+20k+10k\u00b2=10+25k+10k\u00b2,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n7+15k+4k\u00b2 -10 -25k -10k\u00b2=0 \u21d2-3 -10k -6k\u00b2=0,\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n6k\u00b2+10k +3=0,\n\nSolve for k:\n\nk=(-10 \u00b1sqrt(100-72))/12=(-10\u00b1sqrt(28))/12=(-10\u00b12\u221a7)/12,\n\nBut k=log23\u22481.58496,\n\nThus,\n\n6k\u00b2+10k +3\u22486*(2.513)+10*1.58496+3\u224815.078+15.8496+3\u224833.9276\u22600,\n\nThus, this does not hold, which means that the assumption that a =b +c leads to a contradiction unless k has a specific value,\n\nTherefore, this assumption is invalid.\n\nThus, there must be another approach.\n\nPerhaps the minimal S is achieved when all three quadratics have real roots and the equations are satisfied.

solution.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in the sign when forming the equation.\n\nLet me revisit the earlier steps.\n\nWe had variables a,b,c expressed in terms of S and their quadratics,\n\nAnd we set up the equation:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2-4K1)+sqrt(S\u00b2-4K2)+sqrt(S\u00b2-4K3)=S,\n\nBut the derivation was based on choosing the smaller root for each variable,\n\nAssuming that a=(S -sqrt(S\u00b2-4K1))/2,\n\n etc., leading to the equation.\n\nBut perhaps the assumption should be different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct equation is:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2-4K1)+sqrt(S\u00b2-4K2)+sqrt(S\u00b2-4K3)=S,\n\nBut numerically it's not happening.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct equation is:\n\nsqrt(S\u00b2-4K1)+sqrt(S\u00b2-4K2)+sqrt(S\u00b2-4K3)= -S,\n\nBut since sqrt terms are positive, this can't be.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when deriving the equation.\n\nLet me recap the steps:\n\nWe had,\n\na = [S - sqrt(S\u00b2-4K1)]/2,\n\n similarly for b and c,\n\nSumming,\n\n[a +b +c] = [3S - (sqrt terms)]/2 =S,\n\nThus,\n\n3S - sqrt terms =2S \u21d2

of equations,\n\nBut solving this is non-trivial.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the problem's requirement for an exact answer, I think the intended solution is to assume that the minimal xyz is achieved when variables are set such that a=2, b=3, c=1,\n\nBut that would give S=6,\n\nBut then,\n\na(S -a)=2*4=8,\n\n which matches the first equation's K1=8+4k,\n\n only if k=0,\n\n which is impossible,\n\nAlternatively, maybe set k=0,\n\n then the equations become,\n\nx^{log2(yz)}=2^8,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nBut k=log23,\n\nThus, the problem is designed to have the answer as the product when S=8+6k,\n\n leading to xyz=2^8\u00d73^6,\n\n despite the inconsistency in the check,\n\n perhaps due to an error in my check,\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have been designed with a=2, b=3, c=6,\n\n then S=11,\n\n but this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the product xyz when S=8+6k,\n\n xyz=2^{8+6k}=2^8\u00d73^6,\n\n which is 256\u00d7729=186624,\n\n which is an integer,\n\n perhaps this is the answer,\n\n despite the equation inconsistency,\n\n perhaps I made a mistake in the check,\n\n Let me re-calculate:\n\n If a=4+2k,\n\n b=3+2k,\n\n c=1+2k,\n\nThen,\n\nFirst equation: a*(b+c)= (4+2k)*(4+4k),\n\n=4*(4+4k)+2k*(4+4k)=16+16k+8k+8k\u00b2=16+24k+8k\u00b2,\n\nThe RHS is8+4k,\n\n thus,\n\n16+24k+8k\u00b2=8+4k \u21d28k\u00b2+20k+8=0,\n\nDivide by4:\n\n2k\u00b2+5k+2=0,\n\nSolutions:\n\nk=(-5\u00b1sqrt(25-16))/4=(-5\u00b13)/4,\n\nk=(-5+3)/4= -0.5,\n\nk=(-5-3)/4=-2,\n\n thus no solution for k=log23,\n\nThis shows that this approach is invalid,\n\n thus, the problem might require another method,\n\nPerhaps the key is to set variables such that the exponents are proportional to the logarithms,\n\nLet me think of the original equations:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} =2^8 3^4,\n\nTake log base2:\n\nlog2(x)*log2(yz)= log2(2^8 3^4)=8 +4 log23,\n\nLet me denote a=log2x, b=log2y, c=log2z,\n\nThen,\n\na(b +c)=8 +4k,\n\n similarly,\n\nb(a +c)=9+6k,\n\nc(a +b)=5+10k,\n\nwhere k= log23,\n\nLet me denote the three equations:\n\n1. a(b +c) =8+4k,\n\n2. b(a +c)=9+6k,\n\n3. c(a +b)=5+10k,\n\nAnd S=a +b +c,\n\nLet me denote,\n\nLet me subtract equation1 and equation2,\n\na(b +c) -b(a +c)= (8+4k)-(9+6k),\n\nLeft side:ab +ac -ab -bc=ac -bc=c(a-b),\n\nRight side:-1-2k,\n\nThus,\n\nc(a -b)= -1-2k,\n\nSimilarly, subtract equation2 and equation3,\n\nb(a +c) -c(a +b)= (9+6k)-(5+10k),\n\nLeft side:ab + bc -ac - bc=ab -ac=a(b -c),\n\nRight side:4-4k,\n\nThus,\n\na(b -c)=4-4k,\n\nSubtract equation1 and equation3,\n\na(b +c) -c(a +b)= (8+4k)-(5+10k),\n\nLeft:ab +ac -ac -bc=ab - bc= b(a -c),\n\nRight side:3-6k,\n\nThus,\n\nb(a -c)=3-6k,\n\nNow, we have three new equations:\n\n4. c(a -b)= -1-2k,\n\n5. a(b -c)=4-4k,\n\n6. b(a -c)=3-6k,\n\nLet me see if I can find a relationship between these.\n\nLet me denote the differences:\n\nLet me set,\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set D1 = a -b,\n\nD2 = b -c,\n\nThus, a -c =D1 +D2,\n\nAlso,\n\nFrom equation4: c*D1 =-1-2k,\n\nFrom equation5: a*D2 =4-4k,\n\nFrom equation6: b*(D1+D2)=3-6k,\n\nAlso, note that S=a +b +c,\n\nWe can express variables in terms of D1 and D2,\n\nLet me express a, b, c in terms of D1 and D2,\n\nLet me set c as a base variable,\n\nThen,\n\nb =c +D2,\n\na =b +D1 =c +D2 +D1,\n\nThus,\n\na =c +D,\n\n where D=D1 +D2,\n\nThus,\n\nS= a +b +c= (c +D) + (c +D2) +c=3c +D +D2,\n\nBut D=D1 +D2,\n\nThus,\n\nS=3c +D1 +2D2,\n\nNot sure if helpful,\n\nAlternatively,\n\nLet me try to express each equation in terms of D1 and D2,\n\nEquation4: c*D1= -1-2k,\n\nEquation5: a*D2= (c +D2 +D1)*D2=4-4k,\n\nEquation6: b*(D1+D2)= (c +D2)*(D1+D2)=3-6k,\n\nThis may be complex but let's proceed,\n\nFrom equation4,\n\nc= (-1-2k)/D1,\n\nSubstitute into equation5,\n\n(a)*D2= (c +D2 +D1)*D2,\n\nBut a=c +D2 +D1,\n\nThus,\n\n(c +D2 +D1)*D2=4-4k,\n\nSubstitute c= (-1-2k)/D1,\n\nThus,\n\n[ (-1-2k)/D1 +D2 +D1 ] *D2=4-4k,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nFrom equation6,\n\n(b)*(D1+D2)= (c +D2)*(D1+D2)=3-6k,\n\nSubstitute c= (-1-2k)/D1,\n\nThus,\n\n[ (-1-2k)/D1 +D2 ]*(D1+D2)=3-6k,\n\nNow, these equations involve D1 and D2,\n\nThis seems very involved, but perhaps assume a relationship between D1 and D2.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that D1 = m*D2,\n\nLet me set D1 =m*D2,\n\nThen,\n\nEquation4: c= (-1-2k)/(m D2),\n\nEquation5:\n\n[ (-1-2k)/(m D2) +D2 +m D2 ] *D2=4-4k,\n\nSimplify inside brackets:\n\n[ (-1-2k)/(m D2) + D2(1 +m) ],\n\nMultiply by D2:\n\n(-1-2k)/m + D2\u00b2(1 +m)=4-4k,\n\nEquation6:\n\n[ (-1-2k)/(m D2) +D2 ]*(m D2 +D2)=3-6k,\n\nFactor D2 in the second term:\n\n[ term1 ] * D2(m+1)=3-6k,\n\nWhere term1= [ (-1-2k)/(m D2) +D2 ],\n\nThus,\n\n[ (-1-2k)/(m D2) +D2 ]*D2(m+1)= [ (-1-2k)/m +D2\u00b2 ]*(m+1)=3-6k,\n\nThus,\n\nEquation5:\n\n(-1-2k)/m + (1+m)D2\u00b2 =4-4k,\n\nEquation6:\n\n[ (-1-2k)/m +D2\u00b2 ]*(m+1)=3-6k,\n\nThis still requires solving for m and D2,\n\nLet me denote,\n\nLet me set X =D2\u00b2,\n\nThen,\n\nEquation5:\n\n(-1-2k)/m + (1+m)X =4-4k,\n\nEquation6:\n\n[ (-1-2k)/m +X ]*(m+1)=3-6k,\n\nLet me expand equation6,\n\n(m+1)*(-1-2k)/m + (m+1)X =3-6k,\n\nThus,\n\n[ (-1-2k)(m+1)/m ] + (m+1)X=3-6k,\n\nNow, from equation5,\n\n(1+m)X =4-4k + (1+2k)/m,\n\nThus,\n\n(m+1)X= (4-4k)m +1+2k)/m,\n\nThus,\n\nX= [ (4m-4k m +1+2k ) /m ]/(m+1),\n\nNow, substitute into equation6:\n\n[ (-1-2k)(m+1)/m ] + (m+1)X =3-6k,\n\nSubstitute X,\n\n= [ (-1-2k)(m+1)/m ] + (m+1)* [ (4m-4k m +1+2k ) / (m(m+1)) ] =3-6k,\n\nSimplify,\n\n= [ (-1-2k)(m+1)/m ] + [ (4m-4k m +1+2k ) /m ] =3-6k,\n\nCombine terms over m:\n\n[ (-1-2k)(m+1) +4m -4k m +1+2k ] /m =3-6k,\n\nExpand numerator:\n\n- (m+1) -2k(m+1) +4m -4k m +1+2k,\n\n= -m -1 -2k m -2k +4m -4k m +1+2k,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-m +4m)=3m,\n\n(-1 +1)=0,\n\n(-2k m -4k m)= -6k m,\n\n(-2k +2k)=0,\n\nThus numerator=3m -6k m =3m(1-2k),\n\nThus,\n\n3m(1-2k)/m=3(1-2k)=3-6k,\n\nWhich matches the RHS.\n\nThus, the equations are consistent for any m,\n\nThus, the system is underdetermined and needs another condition,\n\nThus, we need to choose m such that the variables are real,\n\nThus, variables are real if,\n\nFrom equation4,\n\nc= (-1-2k)/(m D2),\n\n and D2 is real,\n\n and D1=m D2 is real,\n\n and the quadratics for a,b,c have real roots,\n\n which requires,\n\nS\u00b2\u22654K_i,\n\nThus, the minimal S is obtained when the variables are set such that the quadratics have the minimal possible S,\n\nThus, the minimal S is the solution to the equation involving square roots,\n\n which we found approximately as9.17,\n\n thus, the minimal xyz is2^9.17,\n\n but this must be expressed in terms of exact exponents,\n\n perhaps the problem expects us to multiply the three equations,\n\n as we did earlier,\n\n and take the eighth root or something,\n\nWait, when we multiplied the three equations,\n\n we obtained,\n\nxyz^{ log2 terms} =2^{22}3^{20},\n\n but the product is:\n\nxyz^{ log2 terms} = product,\n\n but the exponents,\n\n log2(yz) etc.,\n\n but I think the key is to consider that,\n\n the product of the three equations gives,\n\nxyz^{ log2 terms} =2^{22}3^{20},\n\n but the left side can be written as,\n\n (xyz)^{ log2 terms summed}?\n\n Not sure,\n\nAlternatively,\n\nLet me consider taking the product of the three equations:\n\nx^{log2(yz)} * y^{log2(zx)} * z^{log2(xy)} =2^{22}3^{20},\n\nAs before,\n\n this product equals (xyz)^{ log2 x + log2 y + log2 z } ?,\n\n No, previously we saw it's xyz^{ log2 x + log2 y + log2 z }?\n\n Wait, let's see:\n\nThe exponent in each term:\n\nFor x^{log2(yz)}=x^{ log2 y + log2 z},\n\n similarly for others,\n\n thus total exponents:\n\nFor x:\n\nlog2 y + log2 z + log2 z + log2 x + log2 y + log2 x,\n\nWait, no,\n\n each term's exponent is the log of the product of the other two variables,\n\n thus total exponents for x:\n\n log2(yz) + log2(zx) + log2(xy),\n\n which simplifies to log2(yz*zx*xy)=log2(x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2)=2(log2x +log2y +log2z),\n\n thus,\n\n the entire product is (xyz)^{2 log2(xyz)} = (xyz)^{2 log2(xyz)} = (xyz)^{log2(xyz\u00b2)}?,\n\n Wait,\n\n log2(yz) + log2(zx) + log2(xy) = log2(yz*zx*xy)= log2(x\u00b2y\u00b2z\u00b2)=2(log2x + log2y + log2z),\n\n thus,\n\n the product is (xyz)^{2 log2(xyz)} = (xyz)^{log2(xyz)^2},\n\n thus,\n\n (xyz)^{log2(xyz)^2} =2^{22}3^{20},\n\nLet me set T=xyz,\n\n thus,\n\n T^{ log2(T^2) }=2^{22}3^{20},\n\n Take log2 of both sides,\n\n log2(T^{ log2(T^2) }) = log2(2^{22}3^{20}),\n\n which is,\n\n log2(T^2) * log2 T =22 +20 log23,\n\n Let me denote L=log2 T,\n\n then,\n\n (2L)*L=2L\u00b2=22 +20k,\n\n where k=log23,\n\nThus,\n\n2L\u00b2=22+20k,\n\nThus,\n\nL\u00b2=11+10k,\n\nThus,\n\nL= sqrt(11+10k),\n\n thus,\n\n log2 T= sqrt(11+10k),\n\n thus,\n\n T=2^{sqrt(11+10k)}.\n\n But this is an exact form,\n\n but the problem asks for the minimal value,\n\n thus, this is the minimal T,\n\n thus,\n\n xyz=2^{sqrt(11+10k)}=2^{sqrt(11+10 log23)}.\n\n But this is an unusual form,\n\n perhaps the problem expects the product of the right-hand sides,\n\n but I think this is the correct answer.\n\nWait, but in the earlier approach where we considered S=a+b+c,\n\n we had ab +ac + bc=11+10k,\n\n and S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)=2(ab +ac + bc)=22+20k,\n\n thus,\n\n S\u00b2 - (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)=2(ab +ac + bc)=22+20k,\n\n but also,\n\n L=log2 T=S,\n\n thus,\n\n T=2^S,\n\n and the equation from multiplying the three equations,\n\n gives,\n\n T^{2S}=2^{22}3^{20},\n\n thus,\n\n (2^S)^{2S}=2^{2S\u00b2}=2^{22}3^{20},\n\n thus,\n\n 2^{2S\u00b2}=2^{22}3^{20},\n\n thus,\n\n 2^{2S\u00b2 -22}=3^{20},\n\n take log2,\n\n2S\u00b2 -22=20 log23,\n\n2S\u00b2=22+20 log23,\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2=11+10 log23,\n\nThus,\n\nS= sqrt(11+10 log23),\n\nThus,\n\nxyz=2^{S}=2^{sqrt(11+10 log23)}.\n\nThis is the exact form,\n\n but the problem might want it expressed in terms of the given equations,\n\n but since the problem specifies to box the answer in the most appropriate LaTeX form,\n\n this is likely the answer,\n\n but I wonder if there's an integer exponent form,\n\n since sqrt(11+10 log23) is not a nice number,\n\n perhaps the problem expects the minimal S to be sqrt(11+10 log23),\n\n thus,\n\n the minimal xyz is2^{sqrt(11+10 log23)}.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the manipulation,\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nThe product of the three equations:\n\nLeft side: x^{log2(yz)} * y^{log2(zx)} * z^{log2(xy)} = (xyz)^{ log2(xyz) * something},\n\nWait, let me re-calculate,\n\nThe exponent for each variable:\n\nFor x:\n\nlog2(yz) + log2(zx) + log2(xy)= log2(yz) + log2(zx) + log2(xy),\n\n= log2(yz * zx * xy)= log2(x\u00b2 y\u00b2 z\u00b2)=2 log2(xyz),\n\nThus,\n\n the left",
