      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem about a rectangle ABCD where BC is 24 units long. There's a point X inside the rectangle such that angle AXB is 90 degrees. Also, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute, and they have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively. The goal is to find the length of AB. Alright, let me start breaking this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. Let me note that BC is given as 24, so that means AD is also 24, since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal. The sides AB and CD are the other pair of opposite sides, which we need to find the length of AB.\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, and angle AXB is 90 degrees. So, triangle AXB is a right-angled triangle with the right angle at X. But also, triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. Hmm, that might be important for some constraints on where X can be located.\n\nThe circumradius of a right-angled triangle is half the hypotenuse. Wait, but triangles AXD and BXC are not necessarily right-angled, but their circumradii are given as 13 and 15. Since they are acute triangles, their circumradius is less than half the length of their longest side. Wait, but maybe I can use the formula for the circumradius of a triangle. The formula is R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where a, b, c are the sides and A is the area. Alternatively, for any triangle, the circumradius R can also be given by R = a/(2*sin A), where A is the angle opposite side a. Maybe that's helpful?\n\nAlternatively, since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, perhaps we can set up a coordinate system here. Let me try that approach. Let me place the rectangle in a coordinate system such that point A is at the origin (0,0), B is at (AB, 0), C is at (AB, 24), and D is at (0,24). So, coordinates:\n\nA: (0, 0)\nB: (x, 0) where x = AB (this is what we need to find)\nC: (x, 24)\nD: (0, 24)\n\nPoint X is inside the rectangle, so its coordinates can be (h, k) where 0 < h < x and 0 < k < 24.\n\nGiven angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so vectors AX and BX are perpendicular. Let me write vectors:\n\nVector AX is from A to X: (h, k)\nVector BX is from B to X: (h - x, k)\n\nTheir dot product should be zero because they are perpendicular. So:\n\nh*(h - x) + k*k = 0\n=> h\u00b2 - h x + k\u00b2 = 0\nThat's equation (1).\n\nNow, the triangles AXD and BXC have circumradii 13 and 15 respectively. Let me recall that the circumradius of a triangle with sides a, b, c is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*A), where A is the area. Alternatively, since the triangle is acute, all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so the circumradius is less than half the length of the longest side. Hmm, but maybe it's better to use coordinates here.\n\nFirst, let me consider triangle AXD. Let's find the coordinates of its vertices:\n\nA: (0, 0)\nX: (h, k)\nD: (0, 24)\n\nSo, the sides of triangle AXD can be calculated using distance formula.\n\nFirst, length AX: sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2)\nLength XD: sqrt((h - 0)^2 + (k - 24)^2) = sqrt(h\u00b2 + (k -24)^2)\nLength AD: 24 (since AD is a side of the rectangle)\n\nWait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, so that's fixed. Wait, but triangle AXD has vertices at A, X, D, so sides AX, XD, and AD. Wait, AD is indeed 24, but since A and D are corners of the rectangle. So, in triangle AXD, sides are AX, XD, and AD. Similarly for triangle BXC.\n\nWait, but AD is a side of the rectangle, so in triangle AXD, the side AD is fixed at 24. Hmm, maybe that can help. Let me think.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC:\n\nB: (x, 0)\nX: (h, k)\nC: (x, 24)\n\nSo, sides are BX, XC, and BC (which is 24 as given). Wait, BC is the side from B to C, so that's 24, which is given. So in triangle BXC, sides are BX, XC, and BC (24). Since BC is a side of the rectangle, so that's fixed.\n\nSo, for both triangles AXD and BXC, one of their sides is a side of the rectangle (AD or BC respectively), which is 24. Since both triangles are acute, the other sides must be such that all angles are less than 90 degrees, so the circumradius conditions must hold.\n\nBut perhaps using coordinates and the formula for circumradius would be better here. Let me recall that the circumradius R of triangle with vertices at (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3) can be calculated by:\n\nR = \\frac{abc}{4\u0394}\n\nwhere a, b, c are the lengths of the sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n\nAlternatively, since coordinates are known, maybe we can compute sides and area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinates, we can write equations for the circumradius.\n\nLet me start with triangle AXD first.\n\nTriangle AXD has coordinates A(0,0), X(h,k), D(0,24). Let me compute the lengths of the sides:\n\nAX: sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2)\nXD: sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2)\nAD: 24\n\nSo the sides are AX, XD, AD. Let's denote them as a, b, c respectively.\n\nWait, but actually, the sides of triangle AXD are:\n\nBetween A and X: AX = sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2)\n\nBetween X and D: XD = sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2)\n\nBetween D and A: DA = 24.\n\nTherefore, the three sides are AX, XD, DA (24). So, the sides are AX, XD, and 24.\n\nSimilarly, triangle BXC has vertices B(x,0), X(h,k), C(x,24). The sides are:\n\nBX: sqrt((x - h)^2 + k\u00b2)\n\nXC: sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 - k)^2 )\n\nBC: 24\n\nSo sides are BX, XC, and BC (24).\n\nThe circumradius for triangle AXD is 13, so:\n\nFor triangle AXD, R = 13 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4 * area of AXD )\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, R = 15 = (BX * XC * BC)/(4 * area of BXC )\n\nAlternatively, maybe using another formula for circumradius. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle is acute, the circumradius can be related to the sides via the formula R = a/(2 sin \u03b1), where \u03b1 is the angle opposite side a. Maybe that could be useful?\n\nAlternatively, since I have coordinates, perhaps it's better to compute the circumradius using coordinates.\n\nThe circumradius can also be found by the formula:\n\nFor a triangle with coordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), the circumradius is given by:\n\nR = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ |AB|^2 |AC|^2 |BC|^2 } }{ 4 |\u0394| }\n\nBut that might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using determinant for area.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the area first for triangle AXD:\n\nThe area \u03941 of triangle AXD can be found since points A, D, and X form a triangle. Since A and D are on the y-axis (since A is (0,0) and D is (0,24)), the base AD is vertical, length 24, and the horizontal coordinate of X is h, so the area is (base * height)/2 = (24 * h)/2 = 12 h.\n\nWait, yes! Since the base is AD (along the y-axis), the height is the horizontal distance from X to the line AD, which is h (since X is at (h,k)). Therefore, area of AXD is 12 h.\n\nSimilarly, the area of triangle BXC: the base BC is vertical from (x,0) to (x,24), so the base length is 24, and the horizontal distance from X to BC is (x - h), so the area is (24*(x - h))/2 = 12*(x - h).\n\nOkay, so areas are straightforward.\n\nNow, for triangle AXD:\n\nCircumradius R1 = 13 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4 * \u03941 )\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\nAX = sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 )\n\nXD = sqrt( h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 )\n\nAD = 24\n\n\u03941 = 12 h\n\nThus:\n\n13 = [ sqrt(h\u00b2 + k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 - k)^2 ) * 24 ] / (4 * 12 h )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12h = 48 h\n\nSo:\n\n13 = [ sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) *24 ] / 48 h\n\nSimplify numerator: The 24 and 48 will simplify to 24/48 = 1/2, so:\n\n13 = [ sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) * sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) / (2 h) ]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 h:\n\n26 h = sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) )\n\nSimilarly, square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n(26 h)^2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nLeft side: 676 h\u00b2\n\nRight side: [h\u00b2 +k\u00b2][h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ]\n\nLet me expand the right side:\n\nFirst term: h\u00b2 +k\u00b2\n\nSecond term: h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 = h\u00b2 + 576 - 48k +k\u00b2\n\nMultiply them together:\n\n(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + 576 -48k +k\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, that's going to be messy, but perhaps I can denote some terms.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote S = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2. Then the second term is S + 576 -48k\n\nTherefore, the product is S*(S + 576 -48k )\n\nSo, 676 h\u00b2 = S*(S +576 -48k )\n\nBut since S = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2, so substitute back:\n\n676 h\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k )\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can do similar steps for triangle BXC, and then get another equation, then solve the system.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor triangle BXC, the sides are BX, XC, and BC (24). The area is 12*(x - h).\n\nCircumradius R2 =15 = ( BX * XC * BC ) / (4 * area )\n\nSo, plug in:\n\nBX = sqrt( (x - h)^2 +k^2 )\n\nXC = sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nBC =24\n\nArea =12*(x - h)\n\nThus,\n\n15 = [ sqrt( (x - h)^2 +k^2 ) * sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) *24 ] / (4 *12*(x - h) )\n\nSimplify denominator: 4*12*(x - h) = 48*(x - h)\n\nSo,\n\n15 = [ sqrt( (x - h)^2 +k^2 ) * sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) *24 ] / [48*(x - h) ]\n\nAgain, 24/48 reduces to 1/2, so:\n\n15 = [ sqrt( (x - h)^2 +k^2 ) * sqrt( same expression ) / (2*(x - h)) ]\n\nWait, let me rewrite:\n\n15 = [ sqrt( (x - h)^2 +k^2 ) * sqrt( (x - h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) *24 ] / (48*(x - h) )\n\nWait, perhaps simplifying the numerator terms step by step:\n\nLet me denote T = (x - h)^2 +k^2 and U = (x - h)^2 + (24 -k)^2. Then the numerator is sqrt(T)*sqrt(U)*24, and the denominator is 48*(x - h). So,\n\n15 = [ sqrt(T U) *24 ] / [48 (x - h) ]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n15 = [ sqrt(T U) * 24 / 48 ] / (x - h )\n\nSo,\n\n15 = [ sqrt(T U) / 2 ] / (x - h )\n\nMultiply both sides by (x - h):\n\n15(x - h) = sqrt(T U)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n30(x - h) = sqrt(T U)\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n900(x - h)^2 = T U\n\nAgain, substituting T and U:\n\nT = (x - h)^2 +k^2\n\nU = (x - h)^2 + (24 -k)^2\n\nTherefore,\n\n900(x - h)^2 = [ (x - h)^2 +k^2 ][ (x - h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ]\n\nHmm, similar structure as the equation for AXD.\n\nSo now, we have two equations:\n\nFrom AXD:\n\n676 h\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )  [Equation 1]\n\nFrom BXC:\n\n900(x - h)^2 = [ (x - h)^2 +k^2 ][ (x - h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ]  [Equation 2]\n\nAdditionally, we have the equation from angle AXB being 90\u00b0, which was:\n\nh\u00b2 - h x + k\u00b2 = 0 => h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x  [Equation 0]\n\nThat's important. Let me note that Equation 0 gives h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x. That might be useful to substitute into the other equations.\n\nLet me see if I can use Equation 0 to substitute in Equation 1.\n\nEquation 1: 676 h\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nBut h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 is h x (from Equation 0), so substitute:\n\n676 h\u00b2 = (h x)( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nAlso, note that h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 can be written as h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) + 576 - 48k = (h x) + 576 -48k (since h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x). So:\n\n676 h\u00b2 = (h x) [ h x + 576 -48k ]\n\nHmm, that might be helpful, but still involves both h and k and x. Let's see.\n\nSimilarly, for Equation 2:\n\n900(x - h)^2 = [ (x - h)^2 +k^2 ][ (x - h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ]\n\nLet me denote v = x - h, so that v = (x - h). Then Equation 2 becomes:\n\n900 v^2 = [ v^2 + k^2 ][ v^2 + (24 -k)^2 ]\n\nSimilarly, note that in Equation 0, h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x, so:\n\nk\u00b2 = h x - h\u00b2\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can express some terms in terms of h and x?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use substitution here. Let me try to see if there is a way to relate the two equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use some variable substitution. Let me think.\n\nLet me see Equation 0: h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x => let me write that as h x - h\u00b2 -k\u00b2 =0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps also note that in triangle AXB, since it's right-angled at X, the coordinates must satisfy the Pythagorean theorem. Wait, but we already used that to get Equation 0. So that's covered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of h and k in terms of coordinates. Let me think of the coordinates of point X as (h,k). Since angle AXB is 90\u00b0, X lies on the circle with diameter AB? Wait, no. Wait, the circle with diameter AB would have all points where angle AXB is a right angle. Since AB is from (0,0) to (x,0), so the midpoint of AB is at (x/2, 0), and the radius is x/2. So the equation of that circle is (h - x/2)^2 + k^2 = (x/2)^2.\n\nExpanding that: h\u00b2 - x h + (x\u00b2)/4 + k\u00b2 = x\u00b2 /4 => h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 -x h =0, which is exactly Equation 0. So, that checks out. So point X lies on the circle with diameter AB. So that's another way to see it.\n\nSo, that's good, but perhaps not immediately helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if I can express variables in terms of each other.\n\nLet me consider that in Equation 0, h x = h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 => so k\u00b2 = h x - h\u00b2.\n\nLet me substitute this into Equation 1 and Equation 2.\n\nStarting with Equation 1:\n\n676 h\u00b2 = (h x)( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nFirst, expand (24 -k)^2 = 576 -48k +k\u00b2. Then,\n\nh\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 = h\u00b2 +576 -48k +k\u00b2 = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) +576 -48k = (h x) +576 -48k (since h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x)\n\nThus, Equation 1 becomes:\n\n676 h\u00b2 = (h x)( h x +576 -48k )\n\nSo,\n\n676 h\u00b2 = h x (h x +576 -48k )\n\nDivide both sides by h (assuming h \u22600, which it is since X is inside the rectangle):\n\n676 h = x (h x +576 -48k )\n\nHmm, okay. Let's note this as Equation 1a.\n\nSimilarly, for Equation 2, let me try to rewrite it. Let me denote v = x - h, so as before, v = x - h. Then, let me also note that k\u00b2 = h x - h\u00b2, so perhaps express terms in terms of v and h or x.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express Equation 2 using substitution.\n\nEquation 2: 900 v^2 = [ v^2 +k^2 ][ v^2 + (24 -k)^2 ] where v =x -h.\n\nWe can write:\n\nFirst, let me compute v^2 +k^2 = (x -h)^2 +k^2 = (x^2 -2x h + h\u00b2) +k\u00b2. But from Equation 0, h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x, so:\n\nv^2 +k^2 = x\u00b2 - 2x h + h x = x\u00b2 -x h.\n\nSimilarly, v^2 + (24 -k)^2 = (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2. Let's expand this:\n\n(x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 = x\u00b2 -2x h + h\u00b2 + 576 -48k +k\u00b2. Again, using h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x,\n\n= x\u00b2 -2x h + h x +576 -48k\n\n= x\u00b2 -x h +576 -48k\n\nSo, putting together, the product [v^2 +k^2][v^2 + (24 -k)^2] is (x\u00b2 -x h)(x\u00b2 -x h +576 -48k )\n\nTherefore, Equation 2:\n\n900 v^2 = (x\u00b2 -x h)(x\u00b2 -x h +576 -48k )\n\nBut v = x - h, so v\u00b2 = (x - h)^2. Therefore,\n\n900 (x - h)^2 = (x\u00b2 -x h)(x\u00b2 -x h +576 -48k )\n\nHmm, so now Equation 2 is expressed in terms of x and h and k. Let's see if we can relate this with Equation 1a.\n\nLooking back at Equation 1a: 676 h = x (h x +576 -48k )\n\nLet me see if we can express (h x +576 -48k ) from here.\n\nFrom Equation 1a:\n\nLet me rearrange Equation 1a:\n\n676 h = x (h x +576 -48k )\n\n=> h x +576 -48k = (676 h)/x\n\nTherefore, substitute into Equation 2:\n\n900 (x - h)^2 = (x\u00b2 -x h)[ (x\u00b2 -x h) +576 -48k ]\n\nWait, but the term (x\u00b2 -x h +576 -48k ) is equal to (x\u00b2 -x h) + (576 -48k), so let me see:\n\nWait, actually, in the second bracket of the product:\n\n(x\u00b2 -x h +576 -48k ) can be written as (x\u00b2 -x h ) + (576 -48k ), but I don't know if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, notice that (h x +576 -48k ) is present in Equation 1a, so perhaps let me denote that term as some variable.\n\nLet me denote Q = h x +576 -48k.\n\nFrom Equation 1a, Q = (676 h)/x.\n\nThen, the second bracket in Equation 2 is (x\u00b2 -x h) + Q - 576 + 576 - 48k ?\n\nWait, maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, notice that x\u00b2 -x h = x(x - h) = x v, since v = x - h.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe first term in the product is (x\u00b2 -x h) = x (x - h) =x v.\n\nThe second term is (x\u00b2 -x h +576 -48k ) = (x\u00b2 -x h) + (576 -48k )\n\nBut 576 -48k can be written as 48(12 -k). Hmm, but perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can express (576 -48k) in terms of Q?\n\nQ = h x +576 -48k => rearranged: 576 -48k = Q - h x. So substituting:\n\nThen, (x\u00b2 -x h +576 -48k ) = (x\u00b2 -x h ) + (Q - h x ) = x\u00b2 -x h + Q - h x =x\u00b2 -2x h + Q\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach is getting too tangled. Let me think of another way.\n\nLet me consider that both equations (1a and 2) involve terms with (576 -48k) and so on. Maybe I can find expressions for 576 -48k.\n\nWait, let's see. From Equation 0, we have h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x, so k\u00b2 = h x - h\u00b2. Let me see if I can find expressions for k in terms of h and x, but that might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since we have two equations (Equation 1a and Equation 2), maybe we can find a relation between them. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that both equations have terms of the form (something)*(something else) involving x, h, and k. Maybe if I can find a substitution that links the two equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider introducing variables to simplify. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote S = h x. Since from Equation 0, h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = S.\n\nAlso, note that Q = S +576 -48k, as before.\n\nWait, in Equation 1a, we had Q = (676 h)/x, so Q = (676/x)*h. But S = h x, so h = S/x, therefore Q = (676/x)*(S/x) = 676 S /x\u00b2. Hmm, but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider variables u = h/x and v = k/x, to normalize. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet me set u = h/x, so h = u x, and v = k/x, so k = v x. Since h and k are coordinates between 0 and x and 0 and 24, respectively, u and v will be between 0 and 1, and 0 and 24/x, but perhaps that's okay.\n\nLet me try substituting h = u x and k = v x into the equations. Let me see:\n\nFirst, Equation 0: h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x\n\n=> (u x)^2 + (v x)^2 = u x * x\n\n=> x\u00b2 (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 ) = u x\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by x\u00b2 (assuming x \u22600):\n\nu\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = u\n\nThus, Equation 0 becomes u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 - u =0. (Equation 0a)\n\nNow, moving to Equation 1:\n\nOriginal Equation 1 was:\n\n676 h\u00b2 = (h x)( h x +576 -48k )\n\nSubstituting h = u x, k =v x, h x = u x\u00b2. Wait, let me do step by step.\n\nFirst, h x = u x *x = u x\u00b2.\n\nh\u00b2 = (u x)^2 = u\u00b2 x\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, 576 -48k = 576 -48(v x) = 576 -48 v x.\n\nThus, Equation 1:\n\n676 * u\u00b2 x\u00b2 = (u x\u00b2)( u x\u00b2 +576 -48 v x )\n\nHmm, this might not be better. Let me check:\n\nWait, the left side is 676 h\u00b2 = 676 u\u00b2 x\u00b2.\n\nThe right side is (h x) multiplied by (h x +576 -48k )\n\nSo h x is u x\u00b2, and h x +576 -48k is u x\u00b2 +576 -48 v x.\n\nTherefore, the right side is u x\u00b2*(u x\u00b2 +576 -48 v x )\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n676 u\u00b2 x\u00b2 = u x\u00b2*( u x\u00b2 +576 -48 v x )\n\nDivide both sides by u x\u00b2 (assuming u \u22600 and x \u22600):\n\n676 u = u x\u00b2 +576 -48 v x\n\nRearranged:\n\nu x\u00b2 -676 u +576 -48 v x =0\n\nHmm, that's an equation in terms of u, v, x.\n\nSimilarly, let me process Equation 2 with substitutions.\n\nEquation 2: 900(x - h)^2 = (x\u00b2 -x h)(x\u00b2 -x h +576 -48k )\n\nAgain, substituting h =u x, k =v x:\n\nFirst, x - h =x - u x =x(1 - u)\n\nLeft side: 900*(x(1 -u ))^2 =900 x\u00b2 (1 -u )\u00b2\n\nRight side: first term (x\u00b2 -x h)=x\u00b2 -x*(u x)=x\u00b2 -u x\u00b2= x\u00b2(1 -u )\n\nSecond term: (x\u00b2 -x h +576 -48k )\n\n= x\u00b2(1 -u ) +576 -48(v x )\n\nThus, the product is x\u00b2(1 -u ) [ x\u00b2(1 -u ) +576 -48 v x ]\n\nThus, Equation 2 becomes:\n\n900 x\u00b2 (1 -u )\u00b2 =x\u00b2(1 -u )[ x\u00b2(1 -u ) +576 -48 v x ]\n\nDivide both sides by x\u00b2(1 -u ) (assuming x \u22600 and 1 -u \u22600, which is valid since X is inside the rectangle so h <x so u <1):\n\n900 (1 -u ) = x\u00b2(1 -u ) +576 -48 v x\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n900(1 -u ) -x\u00b2(1 -u ) -576 +48 v x =0\n\nFactor (1 -u ):\n\n[900 -x\u00b2 -576/(1 -u ) ] Hmm, no, better:\n\nWait, expanding:\n\n900(1 -u ) - x\u00b2(1 -u ) -576 +48 v x =0\n\n= (900 -x\u00b2)(1 -u ) -576 +48 v x =0\n\nHmm, complicated.\n\nAlternatively, leave it as:\n\n900(1 -u ) = x\u00b2(1 -u ) +576 -48 v x\n\n=> 900(1 -u ) - x\u00b2(1 -u ) =576 -48 v x\n\n=> (900 -x\u00b2)(1 -u ) =576 -48 v x\n\nThis is still complex, but maybe combining with other equations.\n\nWe also have Equation 0a: u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 =u => v\u00b2 =u -u\u00b2.\n\nAdditionally, since k =v x must be less than 24 (since X is inside the rectangle), so v x <24 => v <24/x. But perhaps not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express v in terms of u from Equation 0a?\n\nFrom Equation 0a: v\u00b2 =u -u\u00b2, so v = sqrt(u -u\u00b2). Wait, but that would be positive since v =k/x and k is between 0 and24, so v is positive. So sqrt(u -u\u00b2) must be real, so u -u\u00b2 \u22650 => u(1 -u ) \u22650, so 0 \u2264u \u22641, which is true.\n\nSo, v = sqrt(u -u\u00b2 ). Hmm, so maybe substitute v in terms of u.\n\nLet me attempt to do that.\n\nLet me set v = sqrt(u -u\u00b2 ). Let me note that.\n\nTherefore, v x = x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, let me see if I can rewrite the equations in terms of u and x.\n\nStarting with Equation 1's transformed version:\n\nFrom Equation 1:\n\n676 u = u x\u00b2 +576 -48 v x\n\nSubstitute v x = x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 ):\n\n676 u = u x\u00b2 +576 -48 x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, still complicated, but perhaps manageable.\n\nSimilarly, Equation 2's transformed version:\n\nFrom Equation 2:\n\n900(1 -u ) = x\u00b2(1 -u ) +576 -48 v x\n\nAgain, substitute v x = x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 ):\n\n900(1 -u ) =x\u00b2(1 -u ) +576 -48x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, so now both equations (Equation 1 and Equation 2 transformed) have the term sqrt(u -u\u00b2 ) and terms with x\u00b2(1 -u ), etc. Perhaps we can set variables such that terms can be related.\n\nLet me denote w = sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nSo, w = sqrt(u(1 -u )) => w\u00b2 =u(1 -u )\n\nAlso, note that sqrt(u -u\u00b2 ) =w.\n\nTherefore, Equation1 becomes:\n\n676 u = u x\u00b2 +576 -48x w\n\nEquation2 becomes:\n\n900(1 -u ) =x\u00b2(1 -u ) +576 -48x w\n\nWait a minute! Let's see:\n\nEquation2 after substitution:\n\n900(1 -u ) =x\u00b2(1 -u ) +576 -48x w\n\nEquation1:\n\n676 u = u x\u00b2 +576 -48x w\n\nNotice that both equations have the term (576 -48x w), but in different contexts.\n\nLet me rearrange both equations to express (576 -48x w ) in terms of other variables.\n\nFrom Equation1:\n\n576 -48x w =676 u -u x\u00b2\n\nFrom Equation2:\n\n576 -48x w =900(1 -u ) -x\u00b2(1 -u )\n\nTherefore, set the two expressions equal:\n\n676 u -u x\u00b2 = 900(1 -u ) -x\u00b2(1 -u )\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\n676u - u x\u00b2 = 900 -900u -x\u00b2 +x\u00b2 u\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n676u -u x\u00b2 -900 +900u +x\u00b2 -x\u00b2 u =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(676u +900u) + (-u x\u00b2 -x\u00b2 u ) + (x\u00b2) + (-900) =0\n\nWait, step by step:\n\nFirst term: 676u +900u = (676+900)u =1576 u\n\nSecond term: -u x\u00b2 -x\u00b2 u = -2 u x\u00b2\n\nThird term: +x\u00b2\n\nFourth term: -900\n\nThus, altogether:\n\n1576u -2 u x\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -900 =0\n\nLet me factor terms:\n\nLet me group terms with x\u00b2:\n\n(-2u x\u00b2 +x\u00b2 ) + (1576u -900 ) =0\n\nFactor x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2(-2u +1 ) +1576u -900=0\n\nHmm, interesting. So,\n\nx\u00b2(1 -2u ) +1576u -900 =0  (Equation 3)\n\nNow, that's one equation relating x and u.\n\nIs there another equation that relates x and u? Let's see.\n\nWe had Equation0a: u\u00b2 +v\u00b2=u, and v = sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nWait, but Equation0a is already used to substitute v in terms of u, so maybe we can find another relation from either Equation1 or Equation2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express x\u00b2 from Equation3.\n\nLet me try to solve Equation3 for x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2(1 -2u ) = 900 -1576u\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 = (900 -1576u )/(1 -2u )\n\nHmm, but this requires that 1 -2u \u22600, so u \u22601/2. Let's note that.\n\nSo now, if I can express x\u00b2 in terms of u, then perhaps substitute into Equation1 or Equation2.\n\nLet me pick Equation1, which after substitution became:\n\n676u = u x\u00b2 +576 -48x w\n\nWe can substitute x\u00b2 from above and also need to express w in terms of u.\n\nRecall that w = sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nSo let's rewrite Equation1:\n\n676u = u x\u00b2 +576 -48x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nLet me plug in x\u00b2 from Equation3:\n\nx\u00b2 = (900 -1576u)/(1 -2u )\n\nThus,\n\nFirst term on right: u x\u00b2 = u*(900 -1576u)/(1 -2u )\n\nSecond term: -48x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nSo:\n\n676u = [u*(900 -1576u)/(1 -2u )] +576 -48x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, this still has x term. Let me see if x can be expressed in terms of u?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 ) as a term.\n\nLet me denote z =x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n676u = [u*(900 -1576u)/(1 -2u )] +576 -48 z\n\nBut z is x times sqrt(u -u\u00b2 ). Hmm, perhaps we can express z in terms of x and u, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps square both sides, but that might complicate things more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that Equation3 gives x\u00b2 in terms of u, so x = sqrt( (900 -1576u)/(1 -2u ) ). But that might not help unless we can plug into another equation.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can find another equation involving u and x.\n\nWait, in Equation0a, we have v\u00b2= u -u\u00b2, so (v x)^2 =x\u00b2 (u -u\u00b2 )\n\nAlso, in Equation0, h =u x, so h =u x.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look back to the original problem and see if there is another relation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can set up another equation from the other triangle's equation, but I think we already used both equations.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in Equation3, we have x\u00b2 expressed in terms of u. Let me try to substitute that into Equation1's expression.\n\nLet me proceed step by step:\n\nStarting with Equation1:\n\n676u = u x\u00b2 +576 -48x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nWe can plug in x\u00b2 from Equation3:\n\n676u = u * [ (900 -1576u)/(1 -2u ) ] +576 -48x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute the first term on the right:\n\nu*(900 -1576u)/(1 -2u ) = [900u -1576u\u00b2 ] / (1 -2u )\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n676u = [ (900u -1576u\u00b2 ) / (1 -2u ) ] +576 -48x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nBring all terms except the last one to the left:\n\n676u - [ (900u -1576u\u00b2 ) / (1 -2u ) ] -576 = -48x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n-676u + [ (900u -1576u\u00b2 ) / (1 -2u ) ] +576 =48x sqrt(u -u\u00b2 )\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Perhaps we can find a substitution for u?\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume some value for u and see if it works? Since the problem is likely set with integer values, perhaps the variables result in u being a rational number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a better approach altogether.\n\nWait, going back, maybe coordinate geometry with the circles.\n\nSince point X lies inside the rectangle, and angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so X is on the circle with diameter AB. The circle has center at (x/2,0) and radius x/2.\n\nAlso, triangles AXD and BXC have circumradii 13 and 15. Let me recall that the circumradius of a triangle is given by R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394). Alternatively, for triangle AXD, since it has sides AX, XD, AD=24, and area 12h.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinates to find the circumradius.\n\nFor triangle AXD with coordinates A(0,0), X(h,k), D(0,24). The circumradius can be found by the formula for three points.\n\nThe formula for the circumradius of three points (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3):\n\nR = \\frac{ \\sqrt{ (x1(y2 - y3) +x2(y3 - y1)+x3(y1 - y2))^2 + (y1(x2 -x3)+y2(x3 -x1)+y3(x1 -x2))^2 } }{ 4*\u0394 }\n\nBut that formula might be too complex. Alternatively, perhaps use the circumradius formula for a triangle with coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, the circumradius can be found by the distance from the circumcenter to any vertex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the circumradius using the formula involving coordinates.\n\nLet me recall that for three points A, X, D, the circumradius is given by:\n\nR = \\frac{ |AX| \\cdot |XD| \\cdot |AD| }{4 \\cdot \\text{Area of } AXD }\n\nWhich is what I used earlier.\n\nGiven that, perhaps there's a way to parametrise variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such that we can let h and k be expressed in terms of x, then solve for x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the problem in terms of coordinate geometry where AB is the variable to find, and set up equations accordingly.\n\nWait, another thought: Since AXB is right-angled at X, and X is inside the rectangle, perhaps there is a relation between the positions of X and the sides.\n\nAlternatively, since triangle AXD has a circumradius of 13 and triangle BXC has 15, maybe the sides AX and XD relate to 13, and BX and XC to 15?\n\nAlternatively, in triangle AXD, the circumradius is 13, so the circumradius is related to the sides. Let me think of the sides:\n\nIn triangle AXD, sides are AX, XD, AD=24. The circumradius R = 13 = (AX * XD * AD)/(4 * area )\n\nWe had earlier:\n\n13 = [ sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)*sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2)*24 ] / (4 *12 h )\n\nThis simplifies to 13 = [ sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)*sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) *24 ] / (48 h )\n\nWhich reduces to:\n\n13 = [ sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2) ) *24 ] / (48 h )\n\nWait, that simplifies to:\n\n13 = [ sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2) ) * (24) ] / (48 h )\n\nWhich is 13 = [ sqrt(product) * (24) ] / (48 h )\n\nThus, sqrt(product) *24 /48 h =13 => sqrt(product) / (2 h ) =13\n\nTherefore,\n\nsqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )) =26 h\n\nWhich is what I had before. Squaring both sides:\n\n( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 )(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) = 676 h\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, for triangle BXC, we had:\n\nsqrt( ( (x -h)^2 +k\u00b2 )( (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ) ) = 30 (x -h )\n\nWait, let me check.\n\nWait, for triangle BXC, the equation after simplifying was:\n\n30(x -h ) = sqrt( [ (x -h)^2 +k\u00b2 ][ (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ] )\n\nHence squaring both sides gives:\n\n900(x -h)^2 = [ (x -h)^2 +k\u00b2 ][ (x -h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ]\n\nWhich is the same as Equation 2.\n\nHmm.\n\nNow, perhaps notice that both equations involve products of terms that can be written as (something)^2 + (something else)^2.\n\nAlternatively, think of h and (x -h ) as variables.\n\nLet me denote a = h, and b = x -h, so that a + b =x. Then, since h and (x -h) are both positive (as X is inside the rectangle), so a and b are positive numbers less than x.\n\nAlso, let me denote c =k, so then the vertical coordinate is c, and 0 < c <24.\n\nThus, we can rewrite the equations in terms of a, b, c:\n\nFirst, angle AXB is 90\u00b0, so from Equation0:\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 = h x => a\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =a (a +b )\n\nWait, since x =a +b:\n\na\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = a(a +b ) =a\u00b2 +a b => subtract a\u00b2 from both sides:\n\nc\u00b2 = a b\n\nSo, that gives us c\u00b2 =a b (Equation0b)\n\nThat's a useful relation.\n\nNow, moving on to the first equation (from AXD's circumradius):\n\n( h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 )( h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) = 676 h\u00b2\n\nIn terms of a, b, c:\n\nLeft side:\n\n( a\u00b2 +c\u00b2 )( a\u00b2 + (24 -c )\u00b2 )\n\nRight side:\n\n676 a\u00b2\n\nBut from Equation0b, a\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = a(a +b ) =a\u00b2 +a b, so:\n\nWait, but let me just plug in terms:\n\nFirst term: (a\u00b2 +c\u00b2 ) = a*a +c\u00b2. But c\u00b2 =a b, so a\u00b2 +a b =a(a +b )\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2 + (24 -c )\u00b2 =a\u00b2 + 576 -48c +c\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 +c\u00b2 ) +576 -48c = a(a +b ) +576 -48c\n\nSo the product becomes:\n\n[ a(a +b ) ] * [ a(a +b ) +576 -48c ]\n\n= [ a x ] * [ a x +576 -48c ]\n\nBecause x =a +b.\n\nThus, the product is a x (a x +576 -48c )\n\nSet equal to 676 a\u00b2:\n\na x (a x +576 -48c ) =676 a\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by a (assuming a \u22600):\n\nx (a x +576 -48c ) =676 a\n\nSimilarly, for the second equation (from BXC's circumradius):\n\n900(x -h )\u00b2 = [ (x -h )\u00b2 +k\u00b2 ][ (x -h )\u00b2 + (24 -k )\u00b2 ]\n\nIn terms of a,b,c:\n\nLeft side: 900 b\u00b2\n\nRight side:\n\n[ b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 ][ b\u00b2 + (24 -c )\u00b2 ]\n\nSimilarly, expand:\n\nFirst term: b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =b\u00b2 +c\u00b2. But from Equation0b, c\u00b2 =a b, so this is b\u00b2 +a b =b(a +b ) =b x\n\nSecond term: b\u00b2 + (24 -c )\u00b2 =b\u00b2 +576 -48c +c\u00b2 = (b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 ) +576 -48c =b x +576 -48c\n\nThus, the product is [b x ] [ b x +576 -48c ]\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n900 b\u00b2 =b x [b x +576 -48c ]\n\nDivide both sides by b (assuming b \u22600):\n\n900 b =x [b x +576 -48c ]\n\nThus, now we have two equations:\n\nFrom AXD's circumradius:\n\nx (a x +576 -48c ) =676 a  (Equation 1b)\n\nFrom BXC's circumradius:\n\nx (b x +576 -48c ) =900 b  (Equation 2b)\n\nAdditionally, from Equation0b, we have c\u00b2 =a b (Equation0b)\n\nAlso, note that a +b =x (since a =h, b =x -h )\n\nSo, variables a, b, c, x are related with a +b =x and c\u00b2 =a b.\n\nSo, now, perhaps we can write the equations in terms of a and b, since x =a +b, and c = sqrt(ab )\n\nWait, since c\u00b2 =a b, so c = sqrt(ab ), since c is positive.\n\nTherefore, let me substitute c = sqrt(ab ) into the equations.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite Equation1b:\n\nx (a x +576 -48c ) =676 a\n\nBut x =a +b, so:\n\n(a +b)(a(a +b ) +576 -48 sqrt(ab )) =676a\n\nSimilarly, Equation2b:\n\nx (b x +576 -48c ) =900b\n\nSubstituting x =a +b and c= sqrt(ab ):\n\n(a +b)(b(a +b ) +576 -48 sqrt(ab )) =900b\n\nHmm, this still seems complicated, but perhaps we can denote variables such as s =a +b =x and p = sqrt(ab )=c. Wait, but then p =c and s =x. Also, note that ab =p\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, let me set variables as follows:\n\nLet me let s =a +b (so s =x )\n\nLet me let p = sqrt(ab ) (so p =c )\n\nAlso, ab =p\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, note that:\n\na and b are roots of the equation t\u00b2 -s t +p\u00b2 =0.\n\nBut perhaps using s and p, let me rewrite the equations.\n\nFirst Equation1b:\n\ns (a s +576 -48 p ) =676 a\n\nSimilarly, Equation2b:\n\ns (b s +576 -48 p ) =900 b\n\nHmm, but we still have a and b in there. Alternatively, perhaps express a and b in terms of s and p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps divide Equation1b by a and Equation2b by b to eliminate a and b.\n\nEquation1b divided by a:\n\ns (s + (576/a -48 p /a )) =676\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, Equation1b:\n\ns (a s +576 -48 p ) =676 a\n\nDivide both sides by a:\n\ns (s + (576/a ) - (48 p)/a ) =676\n\nHmm, but this introduces terms with 1/a and p/a, which complicates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express in terms of ratios.\n\nLet me denote r = a/b. Since a and b are positive, r is positive.\n\nThus, a =r b.\n\nThen, since a +b =s => r b +b =s => b =s/(r +1 )\n\nSimilarly, a =r b =r s/(r +1 )\n\nAlso, c = sqrt(ab ) = sqrt( a b )=sqrt(r b\u00b2 )=b sqrt(r )\n\nThus, c = sqrt(r ) * b = sqrt(r )*(s/(r +1 )) = s sqrt(r )/(r +1 )\n\nNow, substituting into the equations.\n\nFirst, Equation1b:\n\ns (a s +576 -48c ) =676 a\n\nSubstitute a =r s/(r +1 ), c = s sqrt(r )/(r +1 )\n\nLeft side:\n\ns [ (r s/(r +1 )) * s +576 -48*(s sqrt(r )/(r +1 )) ]\n\n= s [ (r s\u00b2)/(r +1 ) +576 - (48 s sqrt(r ))/(r +1 ) ]\n\nRight side:\n\n676 *a =676*(r s/(r +1 ))\n\nThus,\n\nLeft side equals Right side:\n\ns [ (r s\u00b2)/(r +1 ) +576 - (48 s sqrt(r ))/(r +1 ) ] =676*(r s/(r +1 ))\n\nMultiply both sides by (r +1 ) to eliminate denominators:\n\ns [ r s\u00b2 +576(r +1 ) -48 s sqrt(r ) ] =676 r s\n\nDivide both sides by s (assuming s \u22600):\n\nr s\u00b2 +576(r +1 ) -48 s sqrt(r ) =676 r\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nr s\u00b2 +576(r +1 ) -48 s sqrt(r ) -676 r =0\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nr s\u00b2 +576r +576 -676r -48 s sqrt(r ) =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nr s\u00b2 -100r +576 -48 s sqrt(r ) =0  (Equation A)\n\nSimilarly, process Equation2b:\n\ns (b s +576 -48c ) =900 b\n\nSubstitute b = s/(r +1 ), c = s sqrt(r )/(r +1 )\n\nLeft side:\n\ns [ (s/(r +1 ))*s +576 -48*(s sqrt(r )/(r +1 )) ]\n\n= s [ s\u00b2/(r +1 ) +576 - (48 s sqrt(r ) )/(r +1 ) ]\n\nRight side:\n\n900*b =900*(s/(r +1 ))\n\nSet equal:\n\ns [ s\u00b2/(r +1 ) +576 - (48 s sqrt(r ) )/(r +1 ) ] =900*(s/(r +1 ))\n\nMultiply both sides by (r +1 ):\n\ns [ s\u00b2 +576(r +1 ) -48 s sqrt(r ) ] =900 s\n\nDivide both sides by s (assuming s \u22600):\n\ns\u00b2 +576(r +1 ) -48 s sqrt(r ) =900\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\ns\u00b2 +576(r +1 ) -48 s sqrt(r ) -900 =0\n\nSimplify terms:\n\ns\u00b2 +576r +576 -900 -48 s sqrt(r ) =0\n\nWhich becomes:\n\ns\u00b2 +576r -324 -48 s sqrt(r ) =0  (Equation B)\n\nNow, we have two equations, Equation A and Equation B, in terms of variables s and r.\n\nEquation A:\n\nr s\u00b2 -100r +576 -48 s sqrt(r ) =0\n\nEquation B:\n\ns\u00b2 +576r -324 -48 s sqrt(r ) =0\n\nHmm, perhaps we can subtract or manipulate these equations to eliminate some terms.\n\nLet me write both equations again:\n\nEquation A:\n\nr s\u00b2 -100r +576 -48 s sqrt(r ) =0 --> (1)\n\nEquation B:\n\ns\u00b2 +576r -324 -48 s sqrt(r ) =0 --> (2)\n\nNotice both have the term -48 s sqrt(r ).

Let me note that from Equation B, we had an expression for s\u00b2, perhaps we can find s in terms of r?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that r is a rational number, given the problem's context and the circumradii being integers. Maybe r is a square number or something.\n\nAlternatively, set t = sqrt(r ), so that r =t\u00b2. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet t = sqrt(r ), so r =t\u00b2. Then, sqrt(r )=t, and r -1 =t\u00b2 -1.\n\nAlso, Equation C:\n\ns\u00b2 (r -1 ) =676 r -900 => s\u00b2 (t\u00b2 -1 ) =676 t\u00b2 -900 --> Equation C'\n\nEquation B:\n\ns\u00b2 = -576r +324 +48 s sqrt(r )(r -1 )\n\nWait, substituting r =t\u00b2 and sqrt(r )=t:\n\ns\u00b2 = -576t\u00b2 +324 +48 s t (t\u00b2 -1 )\n\nThus,\n\ns\u00b2 = -576t\u00b2 +324 +48 s t (t\u00b2 -1 ) --> Equation B'\n\nEquation C':\n\ns\u00b2 = (676 t\u00b2 -900 )/(t\u00b2 -1 )\n\nThus, set Equation B' equal to this:\n\n(676 t\u00b2 -900 )/(t\u00b2 -1 ) = -576 t\u00b2 +324 +48 s t (t\u00b2 -1 )\n\nMultiply both sides by (t\u00b2 -1 ):\n\n676 t\u00b2 -900 = (-576 t\u00b2 +324 )(t\u00b2 -1 ) +48 s t (t\u00b2 -1 )\u00b2\n\nHmm, this is getting too involved, but perhaps we can plug in s from Equation C' ?\n\nWait, from Equation C':\n\ns\u00b2 = (676 t\u00b2 -900 )/(t\u00b2 -1 )\n\nThus, s = sqrt( (676 t\u00b2 -900 )/(t\u00b2 -1 ) )\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe try specific values for t.\n\nSuppose that t is a rational number, so that t\u00b2 is rational. Let's try t=2.\n\nLet me test t=2 (i.e., r =4):\n\nThen,\n\nFrom Equation C':\n\ns\u00b2 = (676*(4) -900)/(4 -1 )= (2704-900)/3= 1804/3 \u2248601.333\u2026 Not a perfect square.\n\nNot integer, maybe not.\n\nTry t=3:\n\nr=9,\n\ns\u00b2=(676*9 -900)/(9-1)= (6084-900)/8=5184/8= 648, which is 648 = 36*18 \u2192 sqrt(648)= 18.108... Not integer.\n\nHmm.\n\nTry t= sqrt( something). Maybe t= 5/3? Let me see.\n\nSuppose t=5/3, then r=(25/9)\n\nEquation C':\n\ns\u00b2= (676*(25/9) -900)/( (25/9)-1 )= ( (16900/9 - 8100/9 )/(16/9 )) = ( (8800/9 )/(16/9 )) =8800/16=550. s\u00b2=550, which is not a square.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, try t= 13/5? Since 13 and 15 are the radii, maybe.\n\nt=13/5, so r=169/25.\n\nThen,\n\ns\u00b2=(676*(169/25) -900)/( (169/25 -1 )) = ( (676*169 -900*25)/25 )/( (144/25 )) =\n\nNumerator: 676*169 = let's compute 676*169. 676 is 26\u00b2, 26*26*169.\n\nWait, 26*169=26*(170-1)=26*170 -26=4420-26=4394. So 26\u00b2 *169 =26*4394=26*(4000+394)=104000 +10,244= 114,244. Wait, but that's 676*169=114,244.\n\nThen 900*25=22,500.\n\nSo numerator: 114244 -22500 =91,744. Then over 25: 91744/25\n\nDivide by denominator 144/25: so total s\u00b2=(91744/25)/(144/25)= 91744/144= 637.111\u2026 Not integer.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe t= sqrt(13/ something ). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equations in terms of t:\n\nFrom Equation C\u2019:\n\ns\u00b2 = (676 t\u00b2 -900)/(t\u00b2 -1 )\n\nEquation B\u2019:\n\ns\u00b2 = -576 t\u00b2 +324 +48 s t (t\u00b2 -1 )\n\nSet equal:\n\n(676 t\u00b2 -900)/(t\u00b2 -1 ) = -576 t\u00b2 +324 +48 s t (t\u00b2 -1 )\n\nBut s is expressed in terms of t via the first equation. This seems recursive.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiply both sides by (t\u00b2 -1 ):\n\n676 t\u00b2 -900 = (-576 t\u00b2 +324)(t\u00b2 -1 ) +48 s t (t\u00b2 -1 )\u00b2\n\nBut s is sqrt( (676 t\u00b2 -900)/(t\u00b2 -1 ) )\n\nThus,\n\nLet me denote numerator as N =676 t\u00b2 -900, denominator D= t\u00b2 -1.\n\nThus s= sqrt(N/D )\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n676 t\u00b2 -900 = (-576 t\u00b2 +324)(t\u00b2 -1 ) +48 * sqrt(N/D ) *t (t\u00b2 -1 )\u00b2\n\nThis is very complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original equations with a, b, c, x:\n\nWe have c\u00b2 =ab,\n\nand the two main equations:\n\nFrom AXD:\n\nx(a x +576 -48c ) =676 a --> Equation 1b\n\nFrom BXC:\n\nx(b x +576 -48c ) =900 b --> Equation2b\n\nLet me try to divide Equation1b by Equation2b:\n\n[ x(a x +576 -48c ) / x(b x +576 -48c ) ] = (676 a )/(900 b )\n\nSimplify:\n\n[ a x +576 -48c ) / (b x +576 -48c ) ] = (676 a )/(900 b )\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n900 b (a x +576 -48c ) =676 a (b x +576 -48c )\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n\n900abx +900b*576 -900b*48c\n\nRight side:\n\n676abx +676a*576 -676a*48c\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n900abx -676abx +900*576b -676*576a -900*48b c +676*48a c =0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nabx(900 -676 ) +576*(900b -676a ) +48c ( -900b +676a ) =0\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\n900-676=224,\n\n576*(900b -676a ) remains,\n\n48c( -900b +676a ) =48c*(- (900b -676a ) )\n\nThus,\n\n224abx +576*(900b -676a ) -48c*(900b -676a )=0\n\nFactor out (900b -676a ):\n\n224abx + (900b -676a )(576 -48c )=0\n\nHmm, interesting.\n\nBut c =sqrt(ab ), so let's substitute c = sqrt(ab )\n\nThus,\n\n224abx + (900b -676a )(576 -48 sqrt(ab )) =0\n\nAlso, x =a +b.\n\nSo,\n\n224ab(a +b ) + (900b -676a )(576 -48 sqrt(ab )) =0\n\nThis equation is still quite complex, but perhaps we can assume that a and b are multiples of some common factor, say, let\u2019s assume that a and b are integers. Since the circumradii are integers (13 and 15), and BC is 24, which is an integer, perhaps the sides are integers.\n\nLet me try to assume that a and b are integers. Then ab =c\u00b2 must be a perfect square, so a and b must be such that their product is a perfect square. So, a and b could be squares or multiples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a and b are both multiples of some common factor so that their product is a square.\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that a = m\u00b2 and b =n\u00b2, so that c=mn.\n\nThen x =m\u00b2 +n\u00b2, and c=mn.\n\nLet me try substituting these into the equations.\n\nSo, let me set a =m\u00b2, b =n\u00b2, c =mn, x =m\u00b2 +n\u00b2.\n\nNow, let's substitute into the equations.\n\nFirst, Equation1b:\n\nx(a x +576 -48c ) =676a\n\nSubstituting:\n\n(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2)(m\u00b2*(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 ) +576 -48mn ) =676 m\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, Equation2b:\n\nx(b x +576 -48c ) =900b\n\nSubstituting:\n\n(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2)(n\u00b2*(m\u00b2 +n\u00b2 ) +576 -48mn ) =900 n\u00b2\n\nThese equations might have integer solutions.\n\nLet me try small integers for m and n.\n\nLet me try m=5 and n=12 (since 5-12-13 triangle comes to mind with circumradius 13. Hmm, but let me see.\n\nWait, let me think. For triangle AXD, circumradius is 13. If AXD has sides such that the circumradius is 13, perhaps the triangle is a scaled version of a 5-12-13 triangle?\n\nWait, but AXD has sides AX, XD, AD=24. If AD is 24, which might be the hypotenuse? But AD is a side of the rectangle, so it's fixed. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle AXD with sides AX, XD, AD=24 has a circumradius of 13. The formula for circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394 ). Here, if AD is the longest side (24), then the circumradius should be at least 12, since for a right triangle, it's half the hypotenuse. Since it's acute, R <24/2=12? Wait no, in an acute triangle, all angles less than 90\u00b0, so the circumradius is less than half the longest side?\n\nWait, actually for any triangle, R = a/(2 sin A), where A is the angle opposite side a. If the triangle is acute, then all angles are less than 90\u00b0, so sin A <1, so R <a/2 for each side. Wait, but R is the same for all sides. So the circumradius must be less than half of the longest side.\n\nGiven that AD is 24, so the longest side could be AD=24, so R <12. But the problem states that the circumradius is 13, which is greater than 12. That contradicts the triangle being acute. Wait, but the problem says that both triangles AXD and BXC are acute. Wait, this is a problem!\n\nWait a second, hold on. The problem states that triangles AXD and BXC are both acute. But according to the circumradius formula, if the triangle is acute, then the circumradius should be less than half the longest side. But in AXD case, if AD is a side of length 24, then the circumradius must be less than 12, but the problem states it's 13. That would be a contradiction. Wait, this must mean that AD is not the longest side in triangle AXD.\n\nAh, that's important. So in triangle AXD, the sides are AX, XD, and AD=24. The circumradius is 13, which must be less than half the longest side. Therefore, the longest side must be greater than 26. So AD=24 can't be the longest side, so either AX or XD must be longer than 24.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC, the circumradius is 15, so the longest side must be longer than 30, so BC=24 can't be the longest side, so either BX or XC must be longer than 30.\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So AD is not the longest side in triangle AXD, so either AX or XD is longer than 24.\n\nSimilarly for BXC.\n\nThis is crucial. So in AXD, the longest side is either AX or XD, which must be greater than 26 (since R=13 < longest side /2 => longest side > 2*R=26). Similarly for BXC, the longest side must be greater than 30.\n\nTherefore, in AXD, one of AX or XD must be longer than 26, and in BXC, one of BX or XC must be longer than 30.\n\nThis gives us constraints on the positions of point X.\n\nGoing back to my previous substitution with m and n, perhaps that could work.\n\nLet me try m=5 and n=12:\n\nThen a =25, b=144, so x =25+144=169.\n\nWait, 25+144=169=13\u00b2, that's interesting.\n\nThen c= sqrt(ab)=sqrt(25*144)=sqrt(3600)=60.\n\nSo c=60.\n\nNow, check if this works with the equations.\n\nFirst, check Equation1b:\n\nx(a x +576 -48c ) =676a\n\nPlugging in:\n\nx=169, a=25, c=60:\n\nLeft side: 169*(25*169 +576 -48*60 )\n\nCompute inside the brackets:\n\n25*169=4225\n\n48*60=2880\n\nThus:\n\n25*169 +576 -48*60 =4225 +576 -2880 =4225 -2880 is 1345, plus 576 is 1345+576=1921\n\nHence left side:169 *1921\n\nCompute 169*1921:\n\nWell, 170*1921= 170*1921= (100+70)*1921= 192100 +134,470= 326,570\n\nSubtract 1*1921: 326,570 -1,921 =324,649\n\nRight side:676 *25=16,900\n\nWait, 324,649 vs 16,900. Not equal. Not good.\n\nHmm, so that combination doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m and n are swapped?\n\nLet me try m=12 and n=5:\n\na=144, b=25, so x=169, c= sqrt(144*25)=60.\n\nEquation1b:\n\nx(a x +576 -48c ) =169*(144*169 +576 -48*60 )\n\nCompute inside:\n\n144*169=24,336\n\n576 - 2880= -2304\n\nTotal:24,336 -2304=22,032\n\nThen 169*22,032 = ?\n\nThis is way larger than 676*144= 97,344. Not matching.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m=5, n= something else?\n\nAlternatively, let me try m= 10 and n= 3:\n\nThen a=100, b=9, x=109, c=30.\n\nCheck Equation1b:\n\nx(a x +576 -48c)=109*(100*109 +576 -48*30 )\n\n=109*(10900 +576 -1440 )\n\n=109*(10900 -864)=109*(10036)=109*10000 +109*36=1,090,000 +3,924=1,093,924\n\nRight side:676*100=67,600. Not equal.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m= 12 and n= 16.\n\nWait, m=12, n=16:\n\nThen a=144, b=256, x=400, c= sqrt(144*256)=sqrt(36864)=192\n\nPlugging into Equation1b:\n\nx(a x +576 -48c ) =400*(144*400 +576 -48*192 )\n\nCompute:\n\n144*400=57,600\n\n48*192=9,216\n\nThus inside:57,600 +576 -9,216= (57,600 -9,216)+576=48,384 +576=48,960\n\nLeft side:400*48,960=19,584,000\n\nRight side:676*144= 97,344. Not equal.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m= 13 and n= something.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nSuppose that in triangle AXD, the longest side is AX or XD, so let me assume that AX is the longest side with length greater than 26. The circumradius is 13, so AX/(2 sin\u03b8)=13, where \u03b8 is the angle opposite AX.\n\nSince AX is the longest side, the angle opposite is the largest angle, which is acute, so \u03b8 <90\u00b0, so sin\u03b8 <1, so AX/(2 sin\u03b8)= R=13 => AX <26, but wait, that contradicts AX being the longest side greater than 26. Wait, this can't be.\n\nWait, maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nWait, the formula R = a/(2 sin A), where a is the side opposite angle A. So if AX is the longest side, then the angle opposite AX is the largest angle, which must be acute (since the triangle is acute). Therefore, the angle opposite AX is <90\u00b0, so sin(angle ) <1, so R = AX/(2 sin(angle )) > AX/2. Since R is given as 13, then AX/2 < R => AX <26. But this contradicts AX needing to be longer than 26 to have R < AX/2. Wait, no:\n\nWait, sorry, no. If AX is the longest side, then R must be greater than (AX)/2 ?\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIf the triangle is acute, then the circumradius R is less than half the length of the longest side. Because for a right-angled triangle, R is half the hypotenuse, and for acute triangles, the circumradius is less than that. Wait, actually, it's the other way around:\n\nIn a right-angled triangle, R is exactly half the hypotenuse. In an acute triangle, the circumradius is less than half the longest side. Because in an acute triangle, the hypotenuse would be the side opposite the largest angle, which is less than 90\u00b0, so the side is shorter than the hypotenuse of a right triangle with the other two sides. Wait, perhaps it's better to think numerically.\n\nSuppose the longest side is L, then in an acute triangle, the circumradius R must satisfy R < L/2.\n\nSince the problem states that triangle AXD is acute with R=13, then L/2 >13 => L>26. So the longest side must be greater than 26. Thus, the side AX or XD must be greater than 26.\n\nThus, in AXD, the longest side (AX or XD) must be greater than 26, and the circumradius is 13, so 13 < L/2 => L >26.\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC with R=15, the longest side must be greater than 30.\n\nTherefore, in AXD, either AX or XD must be greater than 26, and in BXC, either BX or XC must be greater than 30.\n\nThis gives us constraints on the coordinates.\n\nPerhaps we can use the coordinate system equations with the earlier substitutions.\n\nRecall that we had:\n\nFrom Equation0b: c\u00b2 =ab,\n\nEquation1b: x(a x +576 -48c )=676a,\n\nEquation2b: x(b x +576 -48c )=900b,\n\nand x=a +b.\n\nWe might need to solve these equations numerically or find an intelligent substitution.\n\nLet me try to assume that a and b are such that ab is a perfect square, so that c is integer.\n\nLet me suppose a= 16 and b=9, then ab=144, so c=12.\n\nThen x=25.\n\nCheck equations:\n\nEquation1b:25*(16*25 +576 -48*12 )=25*(400 +576 -576)=25*(400)=10,000\n\nRight side:676*16=10,816. Not equal.\n\nClose but not.\n\nTry a=9 and b=16, so same as above.\n\nEquation1b with a=9, b=16:\n\nEquation1b: x=25, so:\n\n25*(9*25 +576 -48*12 )=25*(225 +576 -576)=25*225=5,625\n\nRight side:676*9=6,084.

Not.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis trial and error might not be efficient. Maybe there's another approach.\n\nRecall that in Equation C, we had:\n\ns\u00b2 (r -1 ) =676 r -900,\n\nwhere s =x and r =a/b.\n\nLet me denote r= a/b \u21d2a =r b.\n\nThen s =a +b =b(r +1 )\n\nThus, s\u00b2 =b\u00b2(r+1 )\u00b2\n\nSubstitute into Equation C:\n\nb\u00b2(r+1 )\u00b2 (r -1 ) =676 r -900\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2 (r+1 )\u00b2 (r -1 ) =676r -900 --> Equation D\n\nAlso, from Equation B:\n\ns\u00b2 +576r -324 -48 s sqrt(r ) =0\n\nSubstitute s =b(r +1 ), and sqrt(r )=sqrt(r ):\n\n=> [b\u00b2(r+1 )\u00b2 ] +576r -324 -48 b(r +1 ) sqrt(r ) =0 --> Equation E\n\nNow, we have two equations (D and E) in variables b and r.\n\nThis is still complex, but perhaps we can find r such that 676r -900 is divisible by (r -1 )*(r+1 )\u00b2, so that b is rational.\n\nLet me suppose r is a rational number, so let me let r = p/q in reduced form.\n\nBut this might be too vague.

Perhaps it's better to consider that the problem might have an integer solution for AB, so x is integer.\n\nGiven that BC=24, and the circumradii are 13 and 15, which are integers, it's plausible that AB is an integer, perhaps part of a Pythagorean triple.\n\nLet me assume that AB is 56. I will check if this works.\n\nLet me try x=25? No, why 25? Maybe 25+144=169? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of possible Pythagorean triples where the hypotenuse is 26 or 30.\n\nFor AXD's circumradius 13, which is half of 26, so if AXD has a right angle, it would be 13, but it's acute, so the sides must be such that the circumradius is 13 but the triangle is acute. Perhaps AXD has sides like 10, 24, 26? Wait, 10\u00b2 +24\u00b2=100+576=676=26\u00b2. So that's a right triangle with R=13. But the problem says it's acute. So that's invalid. So the triangle AXD must have all angles less than 90\u00b0, so the sides must not form a right angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sides are 25, 24, and something?\n\nWait, 25\u00b2 +24\u00b2=625+576=1201, sqrt(1201)=34.66, so a triangle with sides 24,25,34.66 would have R= (24*25*34.66)/(4*A). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle AXD has sides 16, 30, 34. Then R= (16*30*34)/(4*A). The area would be?\n\nIf it's a right triangle, but it's acute, so no.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle AXD has sides 26, something, 24. But if the longest side is 26, then R=13 which requires it to be right angle, but it's acute. So the longest side must be greater than 26, so maybe 26.0001? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, since this is taking too long, and given the problem is likely designed to have an integer answer, perhaps the length AB is 56. Let me see why.\n\nIf AB=56, then x=56.\n\nLet me try x=56.\n\nAssume x=56.\n\nThen, Equation F:\n\nh(56\u00b2 -676 ) +56*(576 -48k )=0\n\nCompute 56\u00b2=3136,\n\n3136-676=2460\n\nThus,\n\n2460h +56*(576 -48k )=0\n\nDivide by 4:\n\n615h +14*(576 -48k )=0\n\nCompute 14*576=8,064; 14*(-48k)= -672k\n\nThus,\n\n615h +8,064 -672k=0 \u2192615h -672k = -8,064\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n205h -224k = -2,688 --> Equation H\n\nAlso, Equation0: h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =h*56=56h \u21d2h\u00b2 -56h +k\u00b2=0\n\nLet me rewrite this as:\n\nk\u00b2=56h -h\u00b2\n\nWe also need to ensure that triangles are acute.\n\nNow, let me use the expression for k from Equation H:\n\nFrom Equation H:205h -224k =-2,688 \u21d2224k=205h +2,688 \u21d2k=(205h +2688)/224\n\nPlug into k\u00b2=56h -h\u00b2:\n\n[(205h +2688)/224]^2 =56h -h\u00b2\n\nThis equation can be solved for h, but it's a quadratic equation.\n\nLet me denote numerator as N=205h +2688,\n\nDenominator D=224,\n\nSo,\n\n(N/D)^2 =56h -h\u00b2 \u21d2N\u00b2 = D\u00b2 (56h -h\u00b2 )\n\nExpand left side:\n\n(205h +2688)^2 = (224)^2 (56h -h\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute left side:\n\nLet me compute 205h +2688 squared:\n\nLet me denote a=205h, b=2688,\n\n(a +b)^2 =a\u00b2 +2ab +b\u00b2= (205h)^2 +2*205h*2688 +2688\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, right side:\n\n224\u00b2*(56h -h\u00b2)= (224)^2 *56h - (224)^2 h\u00b2\n\nThis is going to be messy, but perhaps plugging in h as an integer.\n\nLet me suppose h is an integer.\n\nLet me try to find h such that 205h +2688 is divisible by 224?\n\nBecause k must be rational, but perhaps in this case, since we assumed x=56, it's possible.\n\nLet me compute 205h +2688 \u22610 mod224.\n\n205 mod224=205,\n\n2688 mod224=2688/224=12*224=2688 \u21d2 so 2688 mod224=0.\n\nThus,\n\n205h \u22610 mod224 \u21d2205h mod224=0\n\n205 and 224:\n\nCompute GCD(205,224):\n\n224 \u00f7205=1 R19\n\n205 \u00f719=10 R15\n\n19 \u00f715=1 R4\n\n15 \u00f74=3 R3\n\n4 \u00f73=1 R1\n\n3 \u00f71=3 R0 \u21d2 GCD=1\n\nThus, 205h \u22610 mod224 \u21d2 h\u22610 mod224.\n\nBut h must be less than x=56, so h=0 is not possible. Thus, no solution. So x=56 is not valid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, try x= 40.\n\nLet me try x=40.\n\nEquation F:\n\nh(1600 -676 ) +40*(576 -48k )=0 \u21d2h*924 +40*576 -40*48k =0\n\nCompute 40*576=23,040,\n\n40*48=1,920,\n\nThus:\n\n924h +23,040 -1,920k=0 \u21d2924h -1,920k =-23,040\n\nDivide by 12:\n\n77h -160k =-1,920 \u2192 Equation H\n\nEquation0: h\u00b2 +k\u00b2=40h \u21d2k\u00b2=40h -h\u00b2\n\nFrom Equation H:77h +1,920=160k \u21d2k=(77h +1920)/160\n\nPlug into k\u00b2 equation:\n\n[(77h +1920)/160]^2 =40h -h\u00b2\n\nAgain, messy, but maybe try h as integer.\n\nLet me see if 77h +1920 divisible by 160:\n\n77h \u2261 -1920 mod160 \u21d277h \u2261-1920 mod160\n\n1920/160=12 \u21d21920 mod160=0 \u21d2 -1920 mod160=0\n\nThus,\n\n77h \u22610 mod160 \u21d277h \u22610 mod160\n\nGCD(77,160)=1 (since 77 is 7*11, 160 is 16*10)\n\nThus, h must be multiple of 160. But h <40 \u21d2 h=0 invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nTry x= 26.\n\nThen, x=26,\n\nEquation F:\n\nh*(26\u00b2 -676) +26*(576-48k)=0\n\n26\u00b2=676 \u21d2676-676=0,\n\nThus,\n\n0 +26*(576 -48k)=0 \u21d2576 -48k=0 \u21d2k=12.\n\nThen from Equation0:\n\nh\u00b2 +k\u00b2 =26h \u21d2h\u00b2 +144=26h \u21d2h\u00b2 -26h +144=0\n\nDiscriminant: 676-576=100 \u21d2h=(26\u00b110)/2 \u21d2h=18 or 8.\n\nThus, possible h=18 or 8, k=12.\n\nCheck if triangles are acute.\n\nFirst, for h=18, k=12:\n\nCheck triangle AXD: points A(0,0), X(18,12), D(0,24).\n\nAX: distance from (0,0) to (18,12)= sqrt(324+144)=sqrt(468)=6\u221a13\u224821.63\n\nXD: from (18,12) to (0,24)= sqrt(324+144)= same as AX:6\u221a13\u224821.63\n\nAD=24.\n\nThus, triangle AXD has two sides of ~21.63 and one side 24.\n\nThe longest side is AD=24. Wait, but then the circumradius must be less than 12, but it's given as 13. Contradiction. So invalid.\n\nFor h=8, k=12:\n\nAXD's coordinates: A(0,0), X(8,12), D(0,24).\n\nAX= sqrt(64+144)=sqrt(208)=4\u221a13\u224814.42,\n\nXD= sqrt(64 + (12)^2 )=sqrt(64+144)=sqrt(208)= same as AX,\n\nAD=24.\n\nAgain, two sides ~14.42 and 24. Longest side 24, so R must be <12, but given as 13. Contradiction. So x=26 is invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nTry x= 52.\n\nEquation F:\n\nh*(52\u00b2 -676 ) +52*(576 -48k ) =0\n\n52\u00b2=2704,\n\n2704-676=2028,\n\nThus:\n\n2028h +52*576 -52*48k =0 \u21d22028h +29,952 -2,496k =0 \u21d22028h -2,496k =-29,952\n\nDivide by 12:\n\n169h -208k =-2,496 \u2192 divide by 13:\n\n13h -16k =-192 \u2192 Equation H:13h -16k = -192\n\nEquation0: h\u00b2 +k\u00b2=52h \u21d2k\u00b2=52h -h\u00b2\n\nFrom Equation H:13h +192=16k \u21d2k=(13h +192)/16\n\nPlug into k\u00b2=52h -h\u00b2:\n\n[(13h +192)/16]^2 =52h -h\u00b2\n\nExpand left side:\n\n(169h\u00b2 + 2*13h*192 +192\u00b2)/256 =52h -h\u00b2\n\nMultiply both sides by 256:\n\n169h\u00b2 +49,920h +36,864 =256*(52h -h\u00b2)=13,312h -256h\u00b2\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n169h\u00b2 +49,920h +36,864 -13,312h +256h\u00b2=0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(169+256)h\u00b2 + (49,920-13,312)h +36,864=0 \u21d2425h\u00b2 +36,608h +36,864=0\n\nDivide by GCD 1:\n\nThis quadratic equation likely has no real solutions since discriminant would be negative?\n\nWait compute discriminant:\n\nD= (36,608)^2 -4*425*36,864\n\nThis is huge and likely negative.

Alternatively, using the formula R = abc/(4\u0394).\n\nCompute sides AX, XD, AD:\n\nAX = sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 )\n\nXD = sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nAD =24\n\nArea \u03941 =12h\n\nThus,\n\nR1= (AX * XD * AD)/(4*\u03941 )\n\nGiven R1=13,\n\nThus,\n\n13= (sqrt(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)*sqrt(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2)*24)/(4*12h )\n\nSimplify:\n\n13= [ sqrt((h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )) *24 ]/(48h )\n\nMultiply both sides by 48h:\n\n624h =24 sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) )\n\nDivide by 24:\n\n26h= sqrt( (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ) )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n676h\u00b2=(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\nSimilarly for triangle BXC:\n\nPoints B(x,0), X(h,k), C(x,24).\n\nSides BX= sqrt( (x-h)^2 +k\u00b2 ), XC= sqrt( (x-h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ), BC=24.\n\nArea \u03942=12(x -h)\n\nCircumradius R2=15= (BX * XC *24)/(4*\u03942 )\n\nThus,\n\n15= [ sqrt( (x-h)^2 +k\u00b2 )*sqrt( (x-h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 )*24 ]/(4*12(x -h) )\n\nSimplify:\n\n15= [ sqrt( product )*24 ]/(48(x -h) )\n\nMultiply both sides by48(x -h ):\n\n720(x -h )=24 sqrt( product )\n\nDivide by24:\n\n30(x -h )= sqrt( product )\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n900(x -h )\u00b2= product\n\nThus, the two key equations are:\n\n1.676h\u00b2=(h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 )\n\n2.900(x -h )\u00b2= [ (x-h)^2 +k\u00b2 ][ (x-h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ]\n\nLet me consider that in these equations, the left-hand sides are multiples of squares, and the right-hand sides are products of terms similar to the left.\n\nLet me define for equation1:\n\nLet me set A =h\u00b2 +k\u00b2 and B =h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2.\n\nThen equation1 becomes 676h\u00b2 =A*B.\n\nBut from Equation0: A =h x.\n\nAlso, B = h\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2.\n\nExpand B:\n\nB =h\u00b2 + (24\u00b2 -48k +k\u00b2)= h\u00b2 +576 -48k +k\u00b2= (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2) +576 -48k =A +576 -48k.\n\nThus,\n\nequation1:676h\u00b2 =A*(A +576 -48k )\n\nBut A =h x,\n\nso,\n\n676h\u00b2 =h x (h x +576 -48k )\n\nDivide both sides by h:\n\n676h =x(h x +576 -48k )\n\nSimilarly, for equation2:\n\nLet me set C= (x-h)^2 +k\u00b2 and D= (x-h)^2 + (24 -k)^2.\n\nThen equation2 is 900(x-h)^2=C*D.\n\nAlso, note that C = (x-h)^2 +k\u00b2,\n\nand D= (x-h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 =C +576 -48k.\n\nThus,\n\nequation2:900(x-h)^2 =C*(C +576 -48k )\n\nLet me denote E =x-h,\n\nthen equation2:\n\n900E\u00b2 =C*(C +576 -48k )\n\nBut C=E\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nso,\n\n900E\u00b2=(E\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(E\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k )\n\nExpand the right:\n\n(E\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(E\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k )= (E\u00b2 +k\u00b2)^2 + (576 -48k)(E\u00b2 +k\u00b2 )\n\nThis is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe notice that both equations have similar structure.\n\nLet me compare equation1 and equation2:\n\nFrom equation1:676h =x(h x +576 -48k )\n\nFrom equation2:900E = (x-h)( (x-h)x +576 -48k ), where E=x-h.\n\nWait, no, equation2 after substitution.\n\nWait, equation2 is 900E\u00b2 = [E\u00b2 +k\u00b2][E\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k ]\n\nBut it's not directly analogous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a substitution where the terms involving (576 -48k) can be related between the two equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me let\u2019s compute (576 -48k) from equation1:\n\nFrom equation1:\n\n676h =x(h x +576 -48k )\n\nThus,\n\nx(hx +576 -48k )=676h\n\n=> hx\u00b2 +576x -48xk =676h\n\n=> 576x -48xk =676h -hx\u00b2\n\n=> 48x(12 -k ) =h(676 -x\u00b2 )\n\n=> (12 -k ) = [h(676 -x\u00b2 )]/(48x )\n\nSimilarly, in equation2:\n\n900(x-h)^2 = [(x-h)^2 +k\u00b2][(x-h)^2 + (24 -k)^2 ]\n\nLet me denote E =x -h,\n\nthen,\n\n900E\u00b2 = [E\u00b2 +k\u00b2][E\u00b2 + (24 -k)^2 ]\n\nExpand the RHS:\n\n(E\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(E\u00b2 +576 -48k +k\u00b2 )\n\n= (E\u00b2 +k\u00b2)(E\u00b2 +k\u00b2 +576 -48k )\n\nLet me denote F =E\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nthen,\n\nRHS=F(F +576 -48k )\n\nThus,\n\n900E\u00b2 =F(F +576 -48k )\n\nBut F=E\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nso,\n\n900E\u00b2 = (E\u00b2 +k\u00b2)^2 + (576 -48k)(E\u00b2 +k\u00b2 )\n\nThis is a quadratic in terms of (E\u00b2 +k\u00b2).\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n(E\u00b2 +k\u00b2)^2 + (576 -48k)(E\u00b2 +k\u00b2 ) -900E\u00b2 =0\n\nLet me set G =E\u00b2 +k\u00b2,\n\nthen,\n\nG\u00b2 + (576 -48k)G -900E\u00b2=0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in G.\n\nBut this is still complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express k from equation1's rearrangement.\n\nFrom equation1:\n\n(12 -k ) = [h(676 -x\u00b2 )]/(48x )\n\nLet me solve for k:\n\nk =12 -
