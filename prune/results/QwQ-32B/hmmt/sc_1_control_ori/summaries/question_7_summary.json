      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find a unique triple (a, b, c) of positive real numbers that satisfy two equations. The first equation is 2(a\u00b2 + 1) = 3(b\u00b2 + 1) = 4(c\u00b2 + 1), and the second equation is ab + bc + ca = 1. Then I have to compute a + b + c. Hmm, this looks a bit complex, but let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the first equation has three parts set equal to each other: 2(a\u00b2 + 1), 3(b\u00b2 + 1), and 4(c\u00b2 + 1). Since they're all equal, I can set them equal to a common variable, maybe k? Let me try that. Let me say that all of them are equal to some constant k. So:\n\n2(a\u00b2 + 1) = k  \n3(b\u00b2 + 1) = k  \n4(c\u00b2 + 1) = k\n\nThat way, each expression is equal to k, so they're all equal to each other. That should help me express a, b, and c in terms of k. Let me write each variable squared in terms of k.\n\nStarting with the first equation: 2(a\u00b2 + 1) = k  \nSo, a\u00b2 + 1 = k/2  \nTherefore, a\u00b2 = (k/2) - 1  \nSimilarly,  \nFrom the second equation: 3(b\u00b2 + 1) = k  \nSo, b\u00b2 + 1 = k/3  \nTherefore, b\u00b2 = (k/3) - 1  \nThird equation: 4(c\u00b2 + 1) = k  \nHence, c\u00b2 + 1 = k/4  \nSo, c\u00b2 = (k/4) - 1  \n\nSince a, b, c are positive real numbers, their squares must be non-negative, so each of these expressions must be greater than or equal to zero. So:\n\nFor a\u00b2: (k/2) - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 2  \nFor b\u00b2: (k/3) - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 3  \nFor c\u00b2: (k/4) - 1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 k \u2265 4  \n\nTherefore, the smallest k can be is 4. But since all three inequalities must hold, k must be at least 4. Wait, but the problem states that there's a unique triple, so maybe k is exactly 4? Let me check that later. Maybe not yet. Let's see.\n\nSo now, I can express a, b, and c in terms of k. Since they are positive, we can take the square roots:\n\na = \u221a[(k/2) - 1]  \nb = \u221a[(k/3) - 1]  \nc = \u221a[(k/4) - 1]  \n\nNow, the second equation is ab + bc + ca = 1. So I need to substitute these expressions into that equation and solve for k. That sounds doable, but the algebra might get a bit messy. Let me try.\n\nFirst, let me denote each variable as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define:\n\na = sqrt[(k/2 - 1)]  \nb = sqrt[(k/3 - 1)]  \nc = sqrt[(k/4 - 1)]\n\nSo, substituting into ab + bc + ca = 1:\n\nsqrt[(k/2 - 1)] * sqrt[(k/3 - 1)] + sqrt[(k/3 - 1)] * sqrt[(k/4 - 1)] + sqrt[(k/2 - 1)] * sqrt[(k/4 - 1)] = 1\n\nHmm, this looks quite complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think if there's a substitution or another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set all the expressions equal to k, so:\n\nLet me think of variables in terms of k. Let me see if I can write variables in terms of k and then plug into ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use substitution variables. Let me set variables x, y, z such that:\n\nLet me see, maybe set variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let 2(a\u00b2 + 1) = 3(b\u00b2 +1) = 4(c\u00b2 +1) = k, so as before. Then, perhaps express a, b, c in terms of k as above.\n\nAlternatively, maybe introduce variables like a = tan A, since the equations resemble trigonometric identities? Wait, maybe not. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variables in terms of some parameter. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables such that a = tan \u03b1, b = tan \u03b2, c = tan \u03b3? Hmm, not sure. Let me try algebra first.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables like:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s denote the common value as k. Then, express a, b, c in terms of k as above. Then plug into ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nSo, let me write:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nA = sqrt[(k/2 -1)]  \nB = sqrt[(k/3 -1)]  \nC = sqrt[(k/4 -1)]\n\nWait, but A = a, B = b, C = c. So then the equation becomes A*B + B*C + C*A =1.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nsqrt[(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)] + sqrt[(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)] + sqrt[(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)] =1.\n\nThat's the equation in terms of k. Hmm. This seems quite complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me try to set variables such that the expressions a\u00b2 +1 etc. are proportional to something. Let me think.\n\nLet me see if I can set variables such that:\n\nLet me think of the equations as ratios.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1) = 3(b\u00b2 +1) = 4(c\u00b2 +1) = k.\n\nSo, then:\n\na\u00b2 +1 = k/2  \nb\u00b2 +1 = k/3  \nc\u00b2 +1 = k/4\n\nSo, then, I can write a\u00b2 = (k/2 - 1), b\u00b2 = (k/3 -1), c\u00b2 = (k/4 -1). So, then, perhaps if I let a = sqrt{(k/2 -1)}, etc. But that's the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set x = a^2, y = b^2, z = c^2. Then, the equations become:\n\n2(x +1 ) = 3(y +1 ) =4(z +1 ) =k.\n\nSo, x = (k/2 -1), y = (k/3 -1), z = (k/4 -1). Then, the second equation is ab + bc + ca =1. But since a = sqrt(x), etc., this would lead to sqrt(xy) + sqrt(yz) + sqrt(zx) =1. Hmm, same problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variables in terms of k and set up equations. Alternatively, perhaps make substitution variables.\n\nWait, maybe another approach. Let me suppose that all three expressions equal to the same k. Let's see if there is a relation between a, b, c.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variables as fractions of k. Let me think of variables:\n\nLet me define variables such that:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nLet me think of variables in terms of k. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps if I set variables:\n\nLet me think of variables as:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k, so then we have a\u00b2=(k/2 -1), etc. So, perhaps the key is to find k such that when you plug those into ab + bc + ca =1, it works.\n\nSo, perhaps the equation is:\n\nsqrt[(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)] + sqrt[(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)] + sqrt[(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)] =1.\n\nThis is an equation in k. To solve for k, perhaps we can let t = k, and then write this equation, but it's going to be very complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the problem states that there's a unique solution, so maybe k is an integer? Let me test k=4. Since k must be at least 4, let's try k=4.\n\nIf k=4:\n\nThen,\n\na^2 = (4/2 -1) = 2 -1 =1 \u21d2 a=1\n\nb^2 = (4/3 -1) \u2248 0.333 \u21d2 b \u2248 sqrt(1/3) \u2248 0.577\n\nc^2 = (4/4 -1)=1-1=0 \u21d2 c=0\n\nBut c must be a positive real number. So c=0 is not allowed. So k=4 is invalid. So that's no good.\n\nHmm. Let's try k=5.\n\nThen,\n\na^2 = 5/2 -1 = 1.5 \u21d2 a\u22481.2247\n\nb^2 =5/3 -1\u22480.666 \u21d2 b\u22480.816\n\nc^2=5/4 -1=0.25 \u21d2 c=0.5\n\nThen, compute ab + bc + ca.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nab \u22481.2247*0.816 \u22481.0\n\nbc\u22480.816*0.5\u22480.408\n\nca\u22481.2247*0.5\u22480.612\n\nTotal \u22481.0 +0.408 +0.612\u22482.02. Which is more than 1. Not equal to 1. So that doesn't work.\n\nHmm. Let's try k=6.\n\na^2=6/2 -1=3-1=2 \u21d2 a\u22481.4142\n\nb^2=6/3 -1=2-1=1 \u21d2b=1\n\nc^2=6/4 -1=1.5 -1=0.5 \u21d2c\u22480.7071\n\nCompute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab=1.4142*1\u22481.4142\n\nbc=1*0.7071\u22480.7071\n\nca=1.4142*0.7071\u22481.0\n\nTotal\u22481.4142 +0.7071 +1.0\u22483.1213, which is way over.\n\nHmm. Not good. Maybe k=3? Wait, but earlier we saw that k must be at least 4. Wait, no:\n\nWait, when I considered the constraints for each variable to be real:\n\nFor a to be real, k must be \u22652,\n\nfor b, k \u22653,\n\nfor c, k \u22654,\n\nso the minimal k is 4, but when k=4, c becomes 0. So k must be greater than 4.\n\nHmm. Let me try k=6.5, maybe?\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way. Let me think algebraically.\n\nLet me denote variables in terms of k. Let\u2019s set variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s set variables as:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set x = sqrt(k/2 -1) = a,\n\ny = sqrt(k/3 -1) = b,\n\nz = sqrt(k/4 -1) = c.\n\nThen, the equation is xy + yz + zx =1.\n\nWe need to solve for k such that:\n\nsqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)} + sqrt{(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)} + sqrt{(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1)} =1.\n\nHmm, maybe squaring both sides? But that might get too complicated. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the equation is symmetric in some way? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that since each variable is expressed in terms of k, perhaps we can find a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we let\u2019s set t = k. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt[( (t/2 -1)(t/3 -1) ) ] + sqrt[( (t/3 -1)(t/4 -1) ) ] + sqrt[( (t/2 -1)(t/4 -1) ) ] =1\n\nLet me compute each term inside the square roots:\n\nFirst term: (t/2 -1)(t/3 -1) = ( (t - 2)/2 )*( (t - 3)/3 ) = ( (t - 2)(t -3) ) / 6\n\nSecond term: (t/3 -1)(t/4 -1) = ( (t - 3)/3 )*( (t - 4)/4 ) = ( (t -3)(t -4) ) / 12\n\nThird term: (t/2 -1)(t/4 -1) = ( (t -2)/2 )*( (t -4)/4 ) = ( (t -2)(t -4) ) / 8\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt[ ( (t -2)(t -3) ) / 6 ] + sqrt[ ( (t -3)(t -4) ) / 12 ] + sqrt[ ( (t -2)(t -4) ) / 8 ] =1\n\nHmm, that's still complicated, but maybe we can factor this differently or make substitutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me denote variables u = t - 4, since the minimal k is 4. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps let me set t = k, so that variables are t. Let me see if I can write the equation as a function f(t) =1 and solve numerically? Since the problem states that there's a unique solution, maybe we can find t by trial and error or perhaps there's an integer solution. Let me try k=5 again but see:\n\nWait when k=5, the total was 2.02, which is over. When k=4, we saw it was invalid. Let me try k= something like 8?\n\nWait let me try k=8.\n\nThen,\n\na = sqrt(8/2 -1)=sqrt(4-1)=sqrt(3)\u22481.732\n\nb = sqrt(8/3 -1)=sqrt(8/3 -3/3)=sqrt(5/3)\u22481.291\n\nc = sqrt(8/4 -1)=sqrt(2-1)=1\n\nCompute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab = sqrt(3)*sqrt(5/3) = sqrt(5) \u22482.236\n\nbc = sqrt(5/3)*1\u22481.291\n\nca = sqrt(3)*1\u22481.732\n\nTotal \u22482.236 +1.291 +1.732\u22485.259. That's way over.\n\nHmm, maybe k= something smaller than 5?\n\nWait let's try k= 6. When k=6, the total was 3.12, so even more over. Wait, but when k is smaller than 4, like k=3.5, but c would be imaginary? Let me see:\n\nWait, the minimal k is 4, so we can't go lower. Wait, but when k=4, c is zero, but we need positive real numbers. So k must be greater than 4. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe k=  something like  5/2? Wait, no, k must be at least 4. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires a substitution where I set variables as trigonometric functions? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables such that a = tan A, b = tan B, c = tan C, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the equations as quadratic forms?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Lagrange multipliers? Since there are two equations and three variables, but the problem states there's a unique solution. Maybe.\n\nLet me think of the problem as optimizing a function with constraints. Wait, but maybe overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider variables such that:\n\nLet me set x = a, y = b, z = c. Then the equations are:\n\n2(x\u00b2 +1)=3(y\u00b2 +1)=4(z\u00b2 +1)=k,\n\nand xy + yz + zx =1.\n\nSo, we can write variables in terms of k as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express all variables in terms of a single variable. Let me see.\n\nSuppose I let\u2019s say, express b and c in terms of a. Since 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1), so 3(b\u00b2 +1)=2(a\u00b2 +1) \u21d2 b\u00b2 = (2/3)(a\u00b2 +1) -1 = (2a\u00b2 +2)/3 -1 = (2a\u00b2 -1)/3.\n\nSimilarly, 2(a\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1) \u21d2 c\u00b2 +1 = (2(a\u00b2 +1))/4 \u21d2 c\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 +1)/2 -1 = (a\u00b2 +1 -2)/2 = (a\u00b2 -1)/2.\n\nTherefore, we can express b and c in terms of a:\n\nb = sqrt[(2a\u00b2 -1)/3]\n\nc = sqrt[(a\u00b2 -1)/2]\n\nNow, substitute these into the equation ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\na * sqrt[(2a\u00b2 -1)/3] + sqrt[(2a\u00b2 -1)/3] * sqrt[(a\u00b2 -1)/2] + a * sqrt[(a\u00b2 -1)/2] =1\n\nHmm, this is still complicated, but maybe manageable. Let me denote sqrt[(2a\u00b2 -1)/3] as term1 and sqrt[(a\u00b2 -1)/2] as term2. So:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s say term1 = sqrt[(2a\u00b2 -1)/3]\n\nterm2 = sqrt[(a\u00b2 -1)/2]\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\na*term1 + term1*term2 + a*term2 =1\n\nHmm, maybe factor terms:\n\na*(term1 + term2) + term1*term2 =1\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps square both sides, but this could get very messy. Let me see if I can set a substitution variable here.\n\nLet me set t = a\u00b2. Then, since a is positive, a = sqrt(t). Let's try that substitution.\n\nSo, let\u2019s set t = a\u00b2. Then,\n\nterm1 = sqrt[(2t -1)/3]\n\nterm2 = sqrt[(t -1)/2]\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(t) * sqrt[(2t -1)/3] + sqrt[(2t -1)/3] * sqrt[(t -1)/2] + sqrt(t) * sqrt[(t -1)/2] =1\n\nHmm, still complicated. Let me write each term:\n\nFirst term: sqrt(t * (2t -1)/3 )\n\nSecond term: sqrt( (2t -1)(t -1)/(3*2) ) = sqrt( (2t -1)(t -1)/6 )\n\nThird term: sqrt( t*(t -1)/2 )\n\nSo equation:\n\nsqrt[ (2t\u00b2 - t)/3 ] + sqrt[ (2t\u00b2 -3t +1)/6 ] + sqrt[ (t\u00b2 - t)/2 ] =1\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe square both sides? Although this will be very tedious.\n\nLet me denote the three terms as A, B, C:\n\nA = sqrt[ (2t\u00b2 - t)/3 ]\n\nB = sqrt[ (2t\u00b2 -3t +1)/6 ]\n\nC = sqrt[ (t\u00b2 - t)/2 ]\n\nSo, the equation is A + B + C =1.\n\nLet me compute (A + B + C)^2 =1^2 =1.\n\nExpanding that:\n\nA\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 + 2AB + 2AC + 2BC =1.\n\nNow, compute each term:\n\nA\u00b2 = (2t\u00b2 - t)/3\n\nB\u00b2 = (2t\u00b2 -3t +1)/6\n\nC\u00b2 = (t\u00b2 -t)/2\n\nAdding those up: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = [ (2t\u00b2 -t)/3 + (2t\u00b2 -3t +1)/6 + (t\u00b2 -t)/2 ]\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst term: (2t\u00b2 - t)/3\n\nSecond term: (2t\u00b2 -3t +1)/6\n\nThird term: (t\u00b2 -t)/2 = 3(t\u00b2 - t)/6\n\nLet me convert all to sixths:\n\nFirst term: 2(2t\u00b2 - t)/6 = (4t\u00b2 - 2t)/6\n\nSecond term: (2t\u00b2 -3t +1)/6\n\nThird term: 3(t\u00b2 - t)/6 = (3t\u00b2 -3t)/6\n\nAdding all together:\n\n[4t\u00b2 -2t +2t\u00b2 -3t +1 +3t\u00b2 -3t]/6\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n4t\u00b2 +2t\u00b2 +3t\u00b2 =9t\u00b2\n\n-2t -3t -3t= -8t\n\n+1\n\nThus total numerator:9t\u00b2 -8t +1\n\nTherefore, A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 +C\u00b2= (9t\u00b2 -8t +1)/6\n\nNow, the cross terms: 2AB + 2AC +2BC.\n\nFirst, compute each product:\n\nAB = sqrt[ (2t\u00b2 -t)/3 * (2t\u00b2 -3t +1)/6 ]\n\nLet me compute the product inside sqrt:\n\n[(2t\u00b2 -t)(2t\u00b2 -3t +1)] / (3*6) = [ (2t\u00b2 -t)(2t\u00b2 -3t +1) ] /18\n\nSimilarly, AC = sqrt[ (2t\u00b2 -t)/3 * (t\u00b2 -t)/2 ] = sqrt[ (2t\u00b2 -t)(t\u00b2 -t)/6 ]\n\nAnd BC = sqrt[ (2t\u00b2 -3t +1)/6 * (t\u00b2 - t)/2 ] = sqrt[ (2t\u00b2 -3t +1)(t\u00b2 -t)/12 ]\n\nThis is getting really complicated, but let me see if I can compute each of these terms.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a substitution here. Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps if I set t such that the equation becomes manageable. Alternatively, maybe try to find a value of t that makes this equation hold. Let me suppose that t is a rational number. Maybe t=1? Let me check:\n\nIf t=1,\n\nThen,\n\nA = sqrt[(2(1)^2 -1)/3] = sqrt[(2 -1)/3] = sqrt(1/3) \u22480.577\n\nB = sqrt[(2(1)^2 -3(1)+1)/6] = sqrt[(2 -3 +1)/6]=sqrt(0/6)=0\n\nC= sqrt[(1 -1)/2]=0\n\nSo equation becomes 0.577 +0 +0\u22480.577\u22601. Not good.\n\nt=2:\n\nA= sqrt[(8-2)/3] = sqrt(6/3)=sqrt(2)\u22481.414\n\nB= sqrt[(8-6 +1)/6]=sqrt(3/6)=sqrt(0.5)\u22480.707\n\nC= sqrt[(4-2)/2]=sqrt(1)=1\n\nSo total A+B+C\u22481.414+0.707+1\u22483.121. Not 1.\n\nHmm. t=0.5? Wait but t=a\u00b2 must be at least 1, since c = sqrt[(t -1)/2] must be real. Because c^2=(a\u00b2 -1)/2 must be non-negative. So t must be \u22651. So t=0.5 is invalid.\n\nWait, let me see the constraints on t. Since c must be real:\n\nc\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 -1)/2 \u22650 \u21d2 a\u00b2 \u22651 \u21d2 t \u22651\n\nAlso, from b's expression:\n\nb\u00b2= (2a\u00b2 -1)/3 must be non-negative \u21d2 2a\u00b2 -1 \u22650 \u21d2 a\u00b2 \u22650.5 \u21d2 since a is positive, but since t must be at least 1, that's already satisfied.\n\nTherefore, t must be \u22651.\n\nHmm. Maybe t= 1. Let me check t=1 again, but already did that.\n\nt=1.5?\n\nLet me try t=1.5 (3/2):\n\nThen,\n\nCompute A:\n\nA= sqrt[(2*(2.25) -1.5)/3] = sqrt[(4.5 -1.5)/3] = sqrt[3/3] =1\n\nB= sqrt[(2*(2.25) -3*(1.5)+1)/6]\n\nCompute inside:\n\n2*(2.25) =4.5, 3*1.5=4.5, so 4.5 -4.5 +1=1. So sqrt[1/6]\u22480.408\n\nC= sqrt[( (2.25) -1.5)/2] = sqrt[0.75/2] = sqrt(0.375)\u22480.612\n\nSo total A+B+C\u22481 +0.408 +0.612\u22482.02, same as when k=5. Wait, because t= a\u00b2. When a\u00b2=1.5, then a= sqrt(1.5)\u22481.2247, so k=2(a\u00b2+1)=2*(1.5 +1)=5. So indeed, when t=1.5, k=5, which we tried earlier. So same result.\n\nHmm. Maybe t= something else. Let me think.\n\nWait, perhaps t= 2/3? Wait, but t must be at least 1. Let me try t=  (something like 0.8) but no, too small.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set t= (something). Let me see if there is a smarter substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps suppose that a, b, c are in some proportion. Wait, since the equations are 2(a\u00b2+1)=3(b\u00b2+1)=4(c\u00b2+1), so the ratios between the terms are 2:3:4. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k. So then,\n\nthe ratios between (a\u00b2 +1), (b\u00b2 +1), (c\u00b2 +1) are 3:2: (3/2). Wait, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of k and set up equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the problem requires the minimal value? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables as follows:\n\nLet me denote x = a\u00b2, y = b\u00b2, z = c\u00b2. Then, the first equations become:\n\n2(x +1)=3(y +1)=4(z +1)=k.\n\nSo,\n\nx = (k/2 -1),\n\ny = (k/3 -1),\n\nz = (k/4 -1).\n\nThe second equation is ab + bc + ca =1. Since a = sqrt(x), etc., this is sqrt(x y) + sqrt(y z) + sqrt(z x) =1.\n\nSo, substituting:\n\nsqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1) ) =1.\n\nThis is the same equation as before. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me make a substitution for k. Let me suppose that k is 12m, maybe to eliminate denominators? Let me see.\n\nLet me set k = 12m. Then,\n\nx = (12m/2 -1)=6m -1,\n\ny= (12m/3 -1)=4m -1,\n\nz= (12m/4 -1)=3m -1.\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt( (6m -1)(4m -1) ) + sqrt( (4m -1)(3m -1) ) + sqrt( (6m -1)(3m -1) ) =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is better. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote m as a variable here. Let me look for m such that the above holds.\n\nMaybe m is a fraction. Let me suppose m=1/2.\n\nThen,\n\nsqrt( (3 -1)(2 -1) ) + sqrt( (2 -1)(1.5 -1) ) + sqrt( (3 -1)(1.5 -1) )\n\nWait, m=1/2:\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (6*(1/2) -1)(4*(1/2)-1) )= sqrt( (3-1)(2 -1) )= sqrt(2*1)=sqrt(2)\u22481.414\n\nSecond term: sqrt( (4*(1/2)-1)(3*(1/2)-1) )= sqrt( (2-1)(1.5 -1) )= sqrt(1*0.5)=sqrt(0.5)\u22480.707\n\nThird term: sqrt( (6*(1/2)-1)(3*(1/2)-1) )= sqrt( (3-1)(1.5 -1) )= sqrt(2*0.5)=sqrt(1)=1\n\nAdding them up: 1.414 +0.707 +1\u22483.121, which is the same as when k=6, as before.\n\nHmm. Let me try m= 1/3.\n\nThen,\n\nFirst term:\n\nsqrt( (6*(1/3)-1)(4*(1/3)-1) ) = sqrt( (2 -1)(4/3 -1) )= sqrt(1*(1/3)) = sqrt(1/3)\u22480.577\n\nSecond term:\n\nsqrt( (4/3 -1)(3*(1/3)-1) )= sqrt( (1/3)(1 -1) )= sqrt(0)=0\n\nThird term:\n\nsqrt( (6*(1/3)-1)(3*(1/3)-1) )= sqrt( (2-1)(1 -1) )= sqrt(0)=0\n\nTotal\u22480.577, not 1.\n\nHmm, m=2/3:\n\nThen,\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (6*(2/3)-1)(4*(2/3)-1) )= sqrt( (4 -1)(8/3 -1) )= sqrt(3*(5/3))=sqrt(5)\u22482.236\n\nSecond term: sqrt( (4*(2/3)-1)(3*(2/3)-1) )= sqrt( (8/3 -1)(2 -1) )= sqrt(5/3 *1)=sqrt(5/3)\u22481.291\n\nThird term: sqrt( (6*(2/3)-1)(3*(2/3)-1) )= sqrt( (4 -1)(2-1) )=sqrt(3*1)=sqrt(3)\u22481.732\n\nAdding up \u22482.236+1.291+1.732\u22485.259, similar to k=8.\n\nHmm. Maybe m=1/4?\n\nWait, m=1/4:\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (6*(1/4)-1)(4*(1/4)-1) )= sqrt( (1.5 -1)(1 -1) )= sqrt(0.5*0)=0\n\nSecond and third terms also involve sqrt(0). So not useful.\n\nHmm. Maybe m=0. Let me see, but m must be at least 1/3 to keep y non-negative (since y=4m-1 \u22650 \u21d2 m\u22651/4, but also z=3m -1 \u22650 \u21d2 m \u22651/3. So m must be \u22651/3.\n\nHmm, this trial and error might not be the right approach. Perhaps we need to set up an equation in m and solve numerically.\n\nLet me express the equation in terms of m:\n\nsqrt{(6m-1)(4m -1)} + sqrt{(4m -1)(3m -1)} + sqrt{(6m -1)(3m -1)} =1\n\nLet me denote the left-hand side as f(m). Let me see if I can find m where f(m)=1.\n\nLet me try m=0.5: as before gives f(m)=3.121>1\n\nTry m=0.4:\n\nFirst term sqrt{(2.4 -1)(1.6 -1)}=sqrt(1.4*0.6)=sqrt(0.84)=0.916\n\nSecond term sqrt{(1.6 -1)(1.2 -1)}=sqrt(0.6*0.2)=sqrt(0.12)=0.346\n\nThird term sqrt{(2.4 -1)(1.2 -1)}=sqrt(1.4*0.2)=sqrt(0.28)=0.529\n\nTotal\u22480.916+0.346+0.529\u22481.791. Still bigger than 1.\n\nHmm, m=0.35:\n\nFirst term: sqrt{(6*0.35 -1)(4*0.35 -1)}=sqrt{(2.1-1)(1.4 -1)}=sqrt(1.1*0.4)=sqrt(0.44)=0.663\n\nSecond term: sqrt{(1.4-1)(1.05 -1)}=sqrt(0.4*0.05)=sqrt(0.02)=0.141\n\nThird term: sqrt{(2.1-1)(1.05-1)}=sqrt(1.1*0.05)=sqrt(0.055)=0.234\n\nTotal\u22480.663+0.141+0.234\u22481.038. Close to 1!\n\nThat's very close. So m=0.35 gives approximately 1.038. Maybe m=0.34?\n\nLet me try m=0.34:\n\nFirst term: sqrt{(6*0.34 -1)(4*0.34 -1)}=sqrt{(2.04-1)(1.36-1)}=sqrt(1.04*0.36)=sqrt(0.3744)=0.612\n\nSecond term: sqrt{(1.36-1)(1.02-1)}=sqrt(0.36*0.02)=sqrt(0.0072)=0.0848\n\nThird term: sqrt{(2.04-1)(1.02-1)}=sqrt(1.04*0.02)=sqrt(0.0208)=0.144\n\nTotal\u22480.612+0.0848+0.144\u22480.8408. Hmm, now below 1.\n\nWait, so m=0.35 gives ~1.038, m=0.34 gives ~0.84.\n\nWait, that's a big drop. Wait, maybe my calculations are off. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait for m=0.35:\n\nFirst term:\n\n6m = 2.1, so 6m-1=1.1,\n\n4m=1.4, so 4m-1=0.4,\n\nso sqrt(1.1 *0.4)=sqrt(0.44)=0.6633\n\nSecond term:\n\n4m-1=0.4,\n\n3m=1.05, so 3m-1=0.05,\n\nsqrt(0.4*0.05)=sqrt(0.02)=0.1414\n\nThird term:\n\n6m-1=1.1,\n\n3m-1=0.05,\n\nsqrt(1.1*0.05)=sqrt(0.055)=0.2345\n\nTotal: 0.6633 +0.1414+0.2345\u22481.039. Okay.\n\nAt m=0.34:\n\n6m=2.04, 6m-1=1.04,\n\n4m=1.36, 4m-1=0.36,\n\nsqrt(1.04*0.36)=sqrt(0.3744)=0.612.\n\nSecond term:\n\n4m-1=0.36,\n\n3m=1.02, so 3m-1=0.02,\n\nsqrt(0.36*0.02)=sqrt(0.0072)=0.08485.\n\nThird term:\n\n6m-1=1.04,\n\n3m-1=0.02,\n\nsqrt(1.04*0.02)=sqrt(0.0208)=0.1442.\n\nTotal\u22480.612+0.0848+0.1442\u22480.841.\n\nHmm, so between m=0.34 and m=0.35, the function goes from ~0.84 to ~1.04. Wait, that suggests that maybe the solution is around m\u22480.345?\n\nWait, let me try m=0.345:\n\nFirst term:\n\n6m=2.07, so 6m-1=1.07,\n\n4m=1.38, 4m-1=0.38,\n\nsqrt(1.07*0.38)=sqrt(0.4066)=0.6376.\n\nSecond term:\n\n4m-1=0.38,\n\n3m=1.035, so 3m-1=0.035,\n\nsqrt(0.38*0.035)=sqrt(0.0133)=0.1153.\n\nThird term:\n\n6m-1=1.07,\n\n3m-1=0.035,\n\nsqrt(1.07*0.035)=sqrt(0.03745)=0.1935.\n\nTotal\u22480.6376 +0.1153 +0.1935\u22480.9464. Still below 1.\n\nHmm. Maybe m=0.36?\n\nWait, let me try m=0.36:\n\nFirst term:\n\n6m=2.16, so 6m-1=1.16,\n\n4m=1.44, 4m-1=0.44,\n\nsqrt(1.16*0.44)=sqrt(0.5104)=0.7144.\n\nSecond term:\n\n4m-1=0.44,\n\n3m=1.08, so 3m-1=0.08,\n\nsqrt(0.44*0.08)=sqrt(0.0352)=0.1876.\n\nThird term:\n\n6m-1=1.16,\n\n3m-1=0.08,\n\nsqrt(1.16*0.08)=sqrt(0.0928)=0.3046.\n\nTotal\u22480.7144+0.1876+0.3046\u22481.2066.\n\nHmm, so between m=0.35 and m=0.36, the value increases from ~1.039 to ~1.207.\n\nWait, perhaps m=0.35 gives 1.039, which is close to 1. So maybe the exact value is m=0.35?\n\nWait but the problem states that there is a unique solution, so perhaps there is an exact value here. Maybe I made an error in approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a substitution. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider that the equations are symmetric in a way. Let me think of variables as follows:\n\nLet me set 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables such that:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s set:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s set variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set 2(a\u00b2 +1)=k \u21d2 a\u00b2=(k/2 -1)\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet me set x = a\u00b2, y = b\u00b2, z = c\u00b2.\n\nThen,\n\nx = (k/2 -1),\n\ny = (k/3 -1),\n\nz = (k/4 -1).\n\nThe second equation is ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nExpressed in terms of x, y, z:\n\nsqrt(x y) + sqrt(y z) + sqrt(z x) =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps if I consider variables x, y, z as variables, and set up equations between them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables in terms of k and find a relation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that:\n\nLet me consider the product (a + b + c)^2 =a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nWe need to find a + b + c, so perhaps if I can find a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 and use the given ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nIndeed, if I can compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, then (a + b +c)^2 = (sum squares) + 2*1.\n\nTherefore, if I can find sum of squares, then I can compute the desired value.\n\nLet me compute a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2:\n\nFrom the expressions above,\n\na\u00b2 = (k/2 -1),\n\nb\u00b2 = (k/3 -1),\n\nc\u00b2 = (k/4 -1).\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = (k/2 -1) + (k/3 -1) + (k/4 -1) = (k/2 +k/3 +k/4 ) - 3.\n\nCompute k/2 +k/3 +k/4:\n\nCommon denominator is 12:\n\n6k/12 +4k/12 +3k/12 =13k/12.\n\nThus,\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = (13k/12) -3.\n\nHence,\n\n(a + b +c)^2 = (13k/12 -3) +2*1 =13k/12 -3 +2 =13k/12 -1.\n\nTherefore,\n\na + b +c = sqrt(13k/12 -1).\n\nHmm, so if I can find k, I can compute a + b +c.\n\nBut how does this help? Well, perhaps combine with another equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to relate the equation involving the products ab + bc + ca =1 with the expressions in terms of k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the equation sqrt(xy) + sqrt(yz) + sqrt(zx) =1 can be squared, and then combined with the expression for a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2.\n\nWait, earlier when I tried expanding (sqrt(xy) + sqrt(yz) + sqrt(zx))\u00b2, I got to an equation involving terms of products of square roots. Maybe combine that with the expression for the squares.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of k. Let\u2019s suppose that I can write the equation sqrt(xy) + sqrt(yz) + sqrt(zx) =1 in terms of k.\n\nGiven that x = (k/2 -1), y = (k/3 -1), z=(k/4 -1),\n\nthen sqrt(xy) = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) )\n\nand so on. So the equation is exactly the same as before.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps assume that a + b + c is minimal or something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe make a substitution where I let\u2019s set variables as follows:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set variables u, v, w such that:\n\nLet me set u = sqrt(k/2 -1),\n\nv = sqrt(k/3 -1),\n\nw = sqrt(k/4 -1),\n\nTherefore, a=u, b=v, c=w,\n\nand the equation is uv + vw + wu =1,\n\nand we want to find u + v + w.\n\nAlso, note that:\n\nu\u00b2 =k/2 -1,\n\nv\u00b2 =k/3 -1,\n\nw\u00b2 =k/4 -1.\n\nTherefore, we can write k in terms of each variable:\n\nk= 2(u\u00b2 +1),\n\nk=3(v\u00b2 +1),\n\nk=4(w\u00b2 +1).\n\nTherefore,\n\n2(u\u00b2 +1)=3(v\u00b2 +1)=4(w\u00b2 +1)=k.\n\nSo, this reduces to the same equations. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express all variables in terms of u.\n\nSince k=2(u\u00b2 +1),\n\nthen v= sqrt( (k/3 -1) ) = sqrt( (2(u\u00b2 +1)/3 -1) ) = sqrt( (2u\u00b2 +2 -3)/3 )= sqrt( (2u\u00b2 -1)/3 )\n\nSimilarly, w= sqrt( (k/4 -1) )= sqrt( (2(u\u00b2 +1)/4 -1 )= sqrt( (2u\u00b2 +2 -4)/4 )= sqrt( (2u\u00b2 -2)/4 )= sqrt( (u\u00b2 -1)/2 )\n\nSo, variables v and w are expressed in terms of u. Then, the equation uv + vw + wu =1 becomes:\n\nu*v + v*w + w*u =1.\n\nSubstituting v and w in terms of u:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote v = sqrt( (2u\u00b2 -1)/3 )\n\nw = sqrt( (u\u00b2 -1)/2 )\n\nThen,\n\nuv = u * sqrt( (2u\u00b2 -1)/3 )\n\nvw = sqrt( (2u\u00b2 -1)/3 ) * sqrt( (u\u00b2 -1)/2 )\n\nwu = sqrt( (u\u00b2 -1)/2 ) * u\n\nSo, the equation is:\n\nu*sqrt( (2u\u00b2 -1)/3 ) + sqrt( (2u\u00b2 -1)/3 ) * sqrt( (u\u00b2 -1)/2 ) + u*sqrt( (u\u00b2 -1)/2 ) =1\n\nThis is similar to what I had before when substituting in terms of a. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set u = sqrt( something). Let me think of u as variable and try to find u such that this equation holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps make substitution t = u\u00b2, so that u = sqrt(t).\n\nLet me set t = u\u00b2, so then:\n\nv= sqrt( (2t -1)/3 ), w= sqrt( (t -1)/2 )\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(t)*sqrt( (2t -1)/3 ) + sqrt( (2t -1)/3 )*sqrt( (t -1)/2 ) + sqrt(t)*sqrt( (t -1)/2 ) =1\n\nThis is the same as the equation I had earlier when substituting in terms of t =a\u00b2.\n\nHmm, so now I see that this approach is leading me back to where I was before.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the problem states that the solution is unique, so maybe there's a clever substitution or an identity that I'm missing.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the equations resemble the form of an identity in trigonometry or something.\n\nAlternatively, think of variables as hyperbolic functions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variables such that a = tanh \u03b8 or something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the first set of equations as defining variables proportional to something.\n\nWait, maybe set variables as follows:\n\nLet me suppose that a = tan \u03b1, b = tan \u03b2, c = tan \u03b3, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equations as quadratic in variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the expressions 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k can be rewritten as:\n\n(a\u00b2 +1)=k/2,\n\n(b\u00b2 +1)=k/3,\n\n(c\u00b2 +1)=k/4,\n\nTherefore,\n\na\u00b2 =k/2 -1,\n\nb\u00b2 =k/3 -1,\n\nc\u00b2 =k/4 -1,\n\nThus, if I add them up:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = (k/2 +k/3 +k/4 ) -3 = ( (6k +4k +3k)/12 ) -3 = (13k/12) -3,\n\nWhich is what I had before.\n\nAlso, since ab + bc + ca =1, then (a + b +c)^2 = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2(ab + bc +ca) = (13k/12 -3) + 2*1 =13k/12 -1.\n\nTherefore, (a + b +c) = sqrt(13k/12 -1).\n\nSo if I can find k, then I can get the answer.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I can find k through another equation.\n\nWait, but the only other equation is the ab + bc + ca =1, which is already used.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that the variables a, b, c are related in a way that allows the equation ab + bc + ca =1 to be connected with the expressions in terms of k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that (a + b +c)^2 =13k/12 -1,\n\nand also, perhaps consider other symmetric sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the product abc.\n\nWait, maybe we can find abc from the equations?

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality?\n\nWait, but since we need an exact solution, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, think of variables a, b, c as follows:\n\nLet me notice that the equations are similar to the form of 2/x = 3/y =4/z, but with squared terms. Maybe set variables reciprocally?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider substituting variables:\n\nLet me set p= a\u00b2 +1,\n\nq= b\u00b2 +1,\n\nr= c\u00b2 +1,\n\nThen the first equation is 2p=3q=4r=k,\n\nSo p= k/2,\n\nq= k/3,\n\nr= k/4,\n\nAnd also, since a= sqrt(p-1),\n\nb= sqrt(q-1),\n\nc= sqrt(r-1),\n\nThen the second equation is sqrt(p-1)sqrt(q-1) + sqrt(q-1)sqrt(r-1) + sqrt(r-1)sqrt(p-1)=1.\n\nHmm, same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the problem requires the minimal value of a + b +c? But no, it requires the unique triple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to set variables such that a=2b or something, but not sure.\n\nWait, let me think of the equations:\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1)=k.\n\nSo, perhaps express variables in terms of each other.\n\nFrom 2(a\u00b2 +1)=3(b\u00b2 +1):\n\n2a\u00b2 +2 =3b\u00b2 +3 \u21d22a\u00b2 -3b\u00b2=1.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n2(a\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1):\n\n2a\u00b2 +2=4c\u00b2 +4 \u21d22a\u00b2 -4c\u00b2=2 \u21d2a\u00b2 -2c\u00b2=1.\n\nFrom these two equations:\n\n2a\u00b2 -3b\u00b2=1,\n\na\u00b2 -2c\u00b2=1,\n\nWe can write a\u00b2 = 2c\u00b2 +1,\n\nSubstitute into first equation:\n\n2*(2c\u00b2 +1) -3b\u00b2 =1 \u21d24c\u00b2 +2 -3b\u00b2 =1 \u21d24c\u00b2 -3b\u00b2 = -1.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlso, from 3(b\u00b2 +1)=4(c\u00b2 +1):\n\n3b\u00b2 +3=4c\u00b2 +4 \u21d23b\u00b2 -4c\u00b2=1.\n\nWait, so we have:\n\n4c\u00b2 -3b\u00b2 = -1,\n\nand\n\n3b\u00b2 -4c\u00b2 =1.\n\nThese are the same equations multiplied by -1. So they are the same equation. Therefore, there is dependency. So again, the system is underdetermined, needing the fourth equation ab + bc + ca =1.\n\nTherefore, the problem is essentially to solve for variables with the given constraints, and the key equation is ab + bc + ca =1 in terms of k, which is the same as solving the equation in terms of k.\n\nPerhaps I need to accept that I need to solve the equation numerically, given that the problem states there's a unique solution, so maybe the value of a +b +c is sqrt(13k/12 -1). Once I find k numerically, I can compute it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires an exact solution, implying that k is chosen such that the expressions simplify.\n\nWait, perhaps there's an elegant solution when variables are in proportion. Let me suppose that a, b, c are such that the equations can be solved via ratios.\n\nLet me think of variables in terms of k:\n\nLet me think of the expressions for a, b, c:\n\na = sqrt(k/2 -1),\n\nb= sqrt(k/3 -1),\n\nc = sqrt(k/4 -1).\n\nPerhaps set variables to be in geometric progression?

So they do satisfy the first condition.\n\nThen check the second equation ab + bc + ca =\u221a2*1 +1*(1/\u221a2)+\u221a2*(1/\u221a2)= \u221a2 + 1/\u221a2 +1.\n\nCalculates to:\n\n\u221a2 \u22481.414,\n\n1/\u221a2\u22480.707,\n\nAdding them up:1.414+0.707\u22482.121 +1\u22483.121.

previous value at s=0.21 was closer.\n\nGiven this back and forth, I think the problem requires an approximate answer, but since it's a competition problem, there must be an exact answer. Perhaps the answer is 2, but I can\u2019t see it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from an Olympiad and the answer is sqrt(3). But my approximate is about 1.88.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is sqrt( (13/12 *k -1) ), where k is the solution to the equation. Since the problem states that it's unique, perhaps the answer is simply sqrt( (13/12 *k -1) ), but we need to express it in terms of the given equations.\n\nWait, but the problem says to compute a +b +c. Since I can't find an exact solution, I think the approximate answer is about 1.88, but the problem likely expects an exact form. Maybe the answer is sqrt( (13/12 *k -1) ), where k is 42/10 or 21/5, but let me see.\n\nLet me try k= 21/5=4.2,\n\nthen,\n\na +b +c= sqrt(13*(21/5)/12 -1)=sqrt( (273/60 -1 )= sqrt( (273-60)/60)=sqrt(213/60)=sqrt(35.5),\n\nWait, 213/60=3.55,\n\nso sqrt(3.55)=1.884,\n\nwhich is very close to the approximate value.\n\nThus, perhaps k=21/5,\n\nthen,\n\na +b +c= sqrt(13*(21/5)/12 -1)=sqrt( (273/60 -60/60)=213/60=35.5/10=3.55,\n\nso sqrt(213/60).\n\nWait, but 213 divided by 60 is 3.55,\n\nsqrt(213/60)=sqrt(71/20)=sqrt(3.55).\n\nHmm, but 21/5 is 4.2,\n\nthen,\n\nk=21/5,\n\nthen,\n\na\u00b2= (21/5)/2 -1=21/10-10/10=11/10 \u21d2a=sqrt(11/10),\n\nb\u00b2=(21/5)/3 -1=7/5 -1=2/5 \u21d2b=sqrt(2/5),\n\nc\u00b2=(21/5)/4 -1=21/20 -1=1/20 \u21d2c=1/(2\u221a5),\n\nthen,\n\nab + bc + ca= sqrt(11/10)*sqrt(2/5) + sqrt(2/5)*(1/(2\u221a5)) + sqrt(11/10)*(1/(2\u221a5)),\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: sqrt( (11/10)(2/5) )=sqrt(22/50)=sqrt(11/25)=sqrt(11)/5\u22480.663,\n\nSecond term: sqrt(2/5)*(1/(2\u221a5))=sqrt(2)/sqrt(5)*1/(2\u221a5)= sqrt(2)/(2*5)=sqrt(2)/10\u22480.141,\n\nThird term: sqrt(11/10)*(1/(2\u221a5))=sqrt(11)/(2*sqrt(10))\u22483.316/(6.324)=\u22480.524,\n\nTotal\u22480.663+0.141+0.524\u22481.328,\n\nwhich is greater than 1. So not the solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, k= 42/10=4.2,\n\nthen,\n\na= sqrt( (4.2/2 -1)=sqrt(2.1-1)=sqrt(1.1),\n\nb= sqrt(1.4-1)=sqrt(0.4),\n\nc= sqrt(1.05-1)=sqrt(0.05).\n\nThen,\n\nab= sqrt(1.1)*sqrt(0.4)=sqrt(0.44)=0.663,\n\nbc= sqrt(0.4)*sqrt(0.05)=sqrt(0.02)=0.141,\n\nca= sqrt(1.1)*sqrt(0.05)=sqrt(0.055)=0.234,\n\nTotal\u22480.663+0.141+0.234\u22481.038.\n\nClose to 1.038.\n\nThus, if k=4.2, then a +b +c= sqrt(13*4.2/12 -1)=sqrt(4.55-1)=sqrt(3.55)=1.884.\n\nTherefore, the exact answer is sqrt(3.55), but this is  sqrt(213/60).\n\nBut 213 and 60 can be simplified? 213=3\u00d771, 60=12\u00d75. No, so it's sqrt(71/20).\n\nBut perhaps the problem requires the answer in terms of k, but since it's a math competition problem, the answer is likely expressed as sqrt( (13k/12 -1) ), but since k is the solution to the equation, which we can't find exactly, it's likely that the problem has a trick.\n\nWait, going back to the substitution where we set variables x,y,z such that the equation simplifies to xy + yz +xz =1 with the other equations.\n\nLet me try to assume that variables are such that x=2y,\n\nthen,\n\nFrom first equation:\n\n2*(4y\u00b2)=3y\u00b2 +1 \u21d28y\u00b2=3y\u00b2 +1 \u21d25y\u00b2=1 \u21d2y=1/\u221a5,\n\nthen,\n\nx=2/\u221a5,\n\nFrom second equation,\n\n3*(1/5)=4z\u00b2 +1 \u21d23/5 -1=4z\u00b2 \u21d2-2/5=4z\u00b2 \u21d2z imaginary,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, assume y= sqrt( (4z\u00b2 +1)/3 ),\n\nand x= sqrt(2z\u00b2 +1 ),\n\nthen,\n\nthe equation is:\n\nsqrt(2z\u00b2 +1)*sqrt( (4z\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (4z\u00b2 +1)/3 )*z + sqrt(2z\u00b2 +1)*z =1.\n\nLet me set u = sqrt(2z\u00b2 +1),\n\nv = sqrt( (4z\u00b2 +1)/3 ),\n\nthen,\n\nthe equation is uv +vz +uz =1.\n\nBut v = sqrt( (2*(2z\u00b2) +1)/3 ).\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that:\n\nLet me multiply both sides of the equation by sqrt(3):\n\nsqrt(3)*uv + sqrt(3)*vz + sqrt(3)*uz = sqrt(3).\n\nBut I don't see a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set u = z,\n\nthen,\n\nsqrt(2z\u00b2 +1)*sqrt( (4z\u00b2 +1)/3 ) + sqrt( (4z\u00b2 +1)/3 )*z + sqrt(2z\u00b2 +1)*z =1.\n\nLet me set z=0.2,\n\nthen,\n\nsqrt(0.08+1)*sqrt( (0.16+1)/3 )+ sqrt( (0.16+1)/3 )*0.2 + sqrt(0.08+1)*0.2,\n\n=sqrt(1.08)*sqrt(0.3867)+ sqrt(0.3867)*0.2 + sqrt(1.08)*0.2,\n\n\u22481.039*0.622+0.622*0.2+1.039*0.2,\n\n\u22480.646+0.124+0.208\u22480.978\u22480.98,\n\nClose to 1.\n\nThus, the answer is approximately 1.88, and since the problem states uniqueness, I think that the exact value is sqrt( (13k/12 -1) ), where k is the solution to the equation which is approximately 4.176,\n\nThus, the answer is approximately sqrt( (13\u00d74.176)/12 -1 )\u2248sqrt(4.524 -1)=sqrt(3.524).\n\nBut since the problem requires an exact answer, perhaps the answer is sqrt( (13k/12 -1) ), and the problem is designed such that this expression simplifies.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, I had:\n\n(a + b + c )\u00b2 = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2(ab + bc + ca).\n\nWe have:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = (k/2 +k/3 +k/4 ) - 3 = ( (6k +4k +3k)/12 ) -3 = (13k/12) -3,\n\nand,\n\nab + bc + ca =1,\n\nso,\n\n(a +b +c )\u00b2= (13k/12 -3) +2*1=13k/12 -1,\n\nThus,\n\na +b +c= sqrt(13k/12 -1).\n\nTherefore, if we can write the equation in terms of a +b +c,\n\nbut the equation for k is:\n\nsqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ) + sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1) ) =1,\n\nwhich is the same as the equation in terms of a,b,c.\n\nThus, the problem requires solving this equation for k, then substituting into the expression for a +b +c.\n\nSince this is a competition problem, perhaps there is a clever substitution.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me set A = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) ),\n\nB = sqrt( (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) ),\n\nC = sqrt( (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1) ),\n\nThen,\n\nA + B + C =1,\n\nAnd we also have,\n\nA\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1),\n\nB\u00b2=(k/3 -1)(k/4 -1),\n\nC\u00b2=(k/2 -1)(k/4 -1).\n\nLet me compute (A +B +C)^2 =1,\n\nA\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 +2(AB + AC + BC)=1,\n\nWe have:\n\nA\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1) + (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1) + (k/2 -1)(k/4 -1),\n\nLet me compute this expression:\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nFirst term: (k/2 -1)(k/3 -1)=k\u00b2/6 -k/2 -k/3 +1 =k\u00b2/6 -5k/6 +1,\n\nSecond term: (k/3 -1)(k/4 -1)=k\u00b2/12 -k/3 -k",
