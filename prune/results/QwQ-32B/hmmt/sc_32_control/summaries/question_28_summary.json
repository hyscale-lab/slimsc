      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about an isosceles trapezoid ABCD where CD is longer than AB which is 4 units. There's a point E on line CD such that DE = 2, and D is between E and C. M is the midpoint of AE. All the points A, B, C, D, and M lie on a circle with radius 5. I need to find the length of MD. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall what an isosceles trapezoid is. It's a quadrilateral with a pair of parallel sides, called bases, and the non-parallel sides (legs) are equal in length. Since it's isosceles, the base angles are equal, and the diagonals are equal in length. The bases here are AB and CD, with AB = 4 and CD longer. So AB is the shorter base, CD is the longer one. \n\nPoints A, B, C, D, and M lie on a circle, meaning they are concyclic, so the circle is their circumcircle. Since they lie on a circle with radius 5, the distance from each of these points to the center of the circle is 5. The problem asks for MD, so maybe I need to find coordinates for these points and then compute the distance from M to D?\n\nLet me consider setting up a coordinate system to model this trapezoid. Let me place the trapezoid such that the bases AB and CD are horizontal. Let me set point A at (-2, 0) and point B at (2, 0), so that AB has length 4. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs AD and BC are equal in length and symmetric about the y-axis. Let me denote the coordinates of D and C as (p, h) and (-p, h) respectively? Wait, hold on. Wait, if AB is the lower base, then CD is the upper base. Since it's isosceles, the legs AD and BC should be symmetric. Hmm, but if AB is from (-2,0) to (2,0), then points D and C should be above AB. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to center the trapezoid along the y-axis. Let me consider that. Let me let AB be on the x-axis from (-2,0) to (2,0). Then the legs AD and BC will go up to points D and C, which are on the line y = h (height of the trapezoid). Since it's isosceles, the legs are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, point D would be (d, h) and point C would be (-d, h), but wait, but then CD would be from (d, h) to (-d, h), so the length CD would be 2d. Since CD is longer than AB which is 4, so 2d >4, so d>2. Hmm, that might be a way to set it up.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should adjust coordinates so that the center of the circle is at the origin? Wait, but maybe it's better to set coordinates such that the calculations are easier.\n\nAlternatively, let's place point D at the origin? Hmm, but perhaps starting with the standard coordinate system for trapezoid.\n\nWait, maybe let me set point A at (0,0) and point B at (4,0), making AB the lower base. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs AD and BC are equal. Let me have the top base CD be parallel to AB. Let me denote the coordinates as follows:\n\nLet me set point A at (0,0), B at (4,0). Then since it's isosceles, the legs AD and BC are equal in length, so points D and C must be placed symmetrically above AB. Let me denote the coordinates of D as (a, h) and C as (4 - a, h). Since CD is the upper base, its length is (4 - a) - a = 4 - 2a? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, actually, the coordinates of D and C would need to be such that the upper base CD is longer than AB. Wait, maybe I need to adjust that.\n\nAlternatively, if I set point A at (0,0), B at (4,0), then since it's isosceles, the legs AD and BC are symmetric with respect to the vertical line x = 2. So point D would be at (c, h) and point C would be at (4 - c, h). Then the length of CD is (4 - c) - c = 4 - 2c? Wait, but that might give CD shorter than AB if c is positive. Hmm, perhaps I need to reverse. Wait, CD is the upper base, which is longer than AB. So 4 - 2c should be longer than 4. Hmm, but that would require 4 - 2c >4 \u2192 -2c >0 \u2192 c <0. Hmm, maybe that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should place the center of the circle somewhere. Since all five points lie on the circle, maybe the circle is not necessarily centered at a point on the trapezoid's axes? Hmm, this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps coordinate system approach is still the way to go. Let me try again.\n\nLet me set coordinate system such that the center of the circle is at (0,0). Since all points A,B,C,D,M lie on the circle with radius 5, their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 25. Hmm, but then how do I place the trapezoid on this circle?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to set the trapezoid in a coordinate system with AB horizontal. Let me try that again.\n\nLet me fix AB as the lower base, from ( -2, 0 ) to ( 2, 0 ), so that AB has length 4. Then the legs AD and BC go upwards to the upper base CD. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Therefore, point D would be at (d, h) and point C at (-d, h). The length of CD is then 2d, which must be greater than 4, so d >2. The coordinates of the points would be:\n\nA: (-2,0)\n\nB: (2,0)\n\nD: (d, h)\n\nC: (-d, h)\n\nWait, but then CD is from (-d, h) to (d, h), so the length is 2d. Since CD > AB =4, 2d>4 => d>2. That works.\n\nNow, point E is on line CD such that DE = 2, with D between E and C. Wait, no, the problem says D lies between E and C. So point E is on the extension of CD beyond D? Wait, need to check the problem again.\n\nWait, problem says: \"Let E be a point on line CD such that DE=2 and D lies between E and C.\" Wait, D is between E and C? Hmm, so the order on line CD would be E---D---C? So E is 2 units away from D, on the side opposite to C? Because D is between E and C, so starting from E, going through D to reach C. Therefore, E is located 2 units away from D, in the direction opposite to C. Since CD is the line from C to D, so extending past D to E, so DE = 2. So coordinates of E?\n\nLet me see. The coordinates of D are (d, h). The direction from C to D is along the line CD. Since C is (-d, h) and D is (d, h), so the vector from C to D is (2d, 0). But wait, actually, CD is horizontal here because both points have the same y-coordinate h. Wait in my coordinate system above, CD is horizontal from (-d, h) to (d, h). Wait, so CD is along the line y = h, from x=-d to x=d. Therefore, the direction from C to D is towards increasing x. Since D is between E and C, so E must be in the direction opposite to C from D. Wait, no, if D is between E and C, then the points are arranged as E---D---C along the line CD. Since CD is from C to D (assuming direction), but here the line CD is from left to right as (-d,h) to (d,h). So if E is such that D is between E and C, then E must be to the left of D, but beyond D towards the direction opposite to C. Wait, since C is on the left side (at -d), so moving from D (which is at d, h) towards the left would go towards C, but to get E such that D is between E and C, then E would have to be on the other side of D away from C? Wait, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, let's think of the line CD. Since C is at (-d, h) and D is at (d, h), so the line CD is from left to right. If E is a point on line CD such that D is between E and C, that means E is to the right of D? Because if you go from E through D to reach C, but C is on the left. Wait that can't be. Wait, perhaps I need to visualize this.\n\nWait, let me think of CD as a line segment from C to D. If E is on the line CD extended beyond D, then the order would be C---D---E. But the problem says D is between E and C, so E must be on the other side, so the order is E---D---C. Therefore, E is located such that when moving from E to C, you pass through D. So E is on the line CD but extended beyond D away from C. Wait, but CD is from C to D. So to go beyond D away from C, that's the direction towards positive x if D is at (d, h). So E is located at D plus some direction away from C. Since CD is from C (-d,h) to D (d,h), the direction from C to D is (2d, 0). So the direction vector is (2d, 0). Therefore, to go from D away from C, the direction is the same as CD, so adding a multiple of (2d,0). Wait, but DE = 2. Since CD is horizontal here, moving along CD beyond D, the x-coordinate increases. Since DE is 2 units, so moving from D (d, h) in the direction away from C (which is the direction of positive x) by 2 units along the line CD. Since CD is horizontal, moving along x-axis. Therefore, the coordinates of E would be (d + 2, h). Wait, but CD has length 2d, so moving 2 units from D in the direction away from C would give E at (d + 2, h). But is that correct?\n\nWait, but the problem says DE = 2. Since CD is the line segment between C and D, but E is on the line CD extended beyond D, so the distance from D to E is 2. Since CD is horizontal here, the distance along the x-axis direction. The length from D to E is 2, so since the direction is along the x-axis, so E is at (d + 2, h). Alternatively, if the direction from D to E is opposite to CD, but the problem says D is between E and C, so E must be in the direction away from C. Since CD is from C to D, so extending past D would be the correct direction. So yes, E is at (d + 2, h).\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm with coordinates:\n\nPoints C is at (-d, h), D is at (d, h). So the line CD is from (-d, h) to (d, h), so the direction vector is (2d, 0). So moving from D (d, h) in the direction away from C (which is the same as the direction of CD), so adding a vector in the direction of (2d,0). But to get DE = 2, since the direction is horizontal, so moving along x-axis. So the coordinates would be (d + 2, h). Because the distance along the x-axis is 2. Since the y-coordinate remains h. So yes, that seems right. So E is at (d + 2, h).\n\nNow, M is the midpoint of AE. Point A is at (-2, 0), and E is at (d + 2, h). The midpoint M would have coordinates:\n\nx-coordinate: [ -2 + (d + 2) ] / 2 = (d)/2\n\ny-coordinate: [0 + h]/2 = h/2\n\nTherefore, coordinates of M are (d/2, h/2).\n\nNow, all points A, B, C, D, M lie on a circle of radius 5. So all these points must satisfy the equation of the circle. Let me denote the center of the circle as (p, q). Then the equation is (x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = 25. Since all five points lie on this circle, plugging each point into the equation should satisfy it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to set up equations using the coordinates and the fact that they lie on a circle. Let me see.\n\nLet me first note down coordinates of all points:\n\nA: (-2, 0)\n\nB: (2, 0)\n\nC: (-d, h)\n\nD: (d, h)\n\nE: (d + 2, h)\n\nM: (d/2, h/2)\n\nSince all these points lie on the same circle, let's write equations based on their coordinates.\n\nFirst, let's write the general equation of a circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Lx + My + N = 0. Alternatively, using the standard form with center (p, q) and radius 5, but since we don't know the center, maybe using the general equation is better.\n\nAlternatively, since points A, B, C, D, M lie on the circle, we can set up equations for each point. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote the circle equation as (x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = 25. Then plugging in each point gives:\n\nFor point A (-2,0):\n\n(-2 - p)^2 + (0 - q)^2 = 25 --> (p + 2)^2 + q^2 = 25 ...(1)\n\nFor point B (2,0):\n\n(2 - p)^2 + (0 - q)^2 =25 --> (p - 2)^2 + q^2 =25 ...(2)\n\nSubtracting equation (1) - equation (2):\n\n(p + 2)^2 - (p - 2)^2 = 0\n\nExpanding:\n\n[p\u00b2 +4p +4] - [p\u00b2 -4p +4] = 8p =0 \u2192 p=0\n\nSo the x-coordinate of the center is 0. That's helpful.\n\nSo center is (0, q). Let's plug back p=0 into equation (1):\n\n(0 +2)^2 + q\u00b2 =25 \u21d24 + q\u00b2 =25 \u21d2 q\u00b2=21 \u21d2 q=\u00b1\u221a21\n\nHmm, so the center is at (0, \u00b1\u221a21). Hmm, but need to figure out which one. Let's see.\n\nProceeding. Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's plug in point D (d, h):\n\n(d -0)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25 \u21d2d\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25 ...(3)\n\nSimilarly, point C (-d, h):\n\n(-d)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25 \u21d2 same as equation (3). So that's consistent.\n\nPoint E (d +2, h):\n\n(d +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25 ...(4)\n\nPoint M (d/2, h/2):\n\n(d/2)^2 + (h/2 - q)^2 =25 ...(5)\n\nSo now, we have equations (3), (4), (5). Let me write them again:\n\nFrom (3): d\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nFrom (4): (d +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nSubtract equation (3) from (4):\n\n(d +2)^2 - d\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 [d\u00b2 +4d +4] -d\u00b2 =4d +4 =0 \u21d24d +4 =0 \u21d2d = -1\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, but earlier we had that d>2 because CD=2d must be greater than AB=4, so 2d>4 \u21d2d>2. But here we get d= -1? That contradicts. That must mean a mistake.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I messed up the coordinates? Let me check again.\n\nWait, in my coordinate system, point C was at (-d, h) and D at (d, h). So CD length is 2d, so to have CD>AB=4, we need 2d>4 \u21d2d>2. But according to equation (3) and (4), solving gives d = -1? That's impossible, so must have messed up something.\n\nHmm, let me check the equations again.\n\nEquation (3): d\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nEquation (4): (d +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nSubtracting (3) from (4):\n\n(d +2)^2 - d\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 (d\u00b2 +4d +4) -d\u00b2 =4d +4 =0 \u21d24d +4 =0 \u21d2d= -1\n\nHmm, but that's conflicting with the requirement that d>2. So that suggests inconsistency, meaning perhaps there is an error in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe my coordinate system is not the best. Let me check my coordinates again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in defining point C and D. Let me think again.\n\nIn an isosceles trapezoid with bases AB and CD, where AB is the shorter base, then the legs AD and BC must be equal. In my coordinate system, if AB is from (-2,0) to (2,0), then points D and C should be placed symmetrically above, but such that CD is longer. However, if I set D at (d, h) and C at (-d, h), then CD length is 2d, so if CD is longer than AB (which is 4), then indeed 2d >4 \u21d2 d>2. But in solving equations, we end up with d=-1, which is impossible. Therefore, my coordinate assignment might be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I flipped the coordinates of C and D? Let me see. If instead, point C is to the right of D, but in that case, with AB from (-2,0) to (2,0), then to have CD longer, maybe D is at (something, h) and C at (something else, h) such that distance between them is longer. Wait, perhaps I need to assign coordinates differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that in my coordinate system, the point E is located at (d +2, h), but if d is negative, then that would move E further left. Wait, but the problem states that D is between E and C, so maybe the coordinate assignments have an issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to set the coordinates such that CD is from left to right, but with C at (c, h) and D at (d, h) where c < D's x-coordinate. Wait, perhaps I should assign coordinates differently.\n\nLet me try another coordinate system. Let me place the lower base AB on the x-axis, with A at (0,0) and B at (4,0). Then since it's an isosceles trapezoid, the legs AD and BC are equal in length, and the upper base CD is parallel to AB. The coordinates of D and C can be expressed as follows:\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of D as (x, h) and C as (4 + (4 - 2x), h). Wait, no, perhaps better to use symmetry. Since it's isosceles, the trapezoid is symmetric about the vertical line through the midpoint of AB, which is (2,0). Therefore, point D should be at (2 - a, h) and C at (2 + a, h), where a is some positive number. Then the length of CD is (2 + a) - (2 - a) = 2a. Since CD must be longer than AB (which is 4), so 2a >4 \u21d2a>2. \n\nThis might be a better approach. Let me try this coordinate system:\n\nLet me set:\n\nA: (0,0)\n\nB: (4,0)\n\nMidpoint of AB is at (2,0). Then the upper base CD is parallel to AB and located at height h. The coordinates of D and C are (2 - a, h) and (2 + a, h) respectively. So CD length is 2a, which must be greater than 4, so a>2. \n\nNow, point E is on CD such that DE =2 and D is between E and C. Let's see. The line CD goes from (2 - a, h) to (2 + a, h). The direction from D to C is along the positive x-direction. Since D is between E and C, then E is to the left of D (opposite direction from C). Wait, that would mean E is located such that moving from E to D to C. So E is 2 units away from D towards the left. Since CD is horizontal, moving left along the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of E would be:\n\nThe x-coordinate of D is (2 - a). To go left (opposite direction of C) by 2 units, subtract 2 from the x-coordinate. So E's coordinates are (2 - a - 2, h) = ( -a, h ). Wait, but need to check the distance. The distance between D and E should be 2. Since moving along the line CD (horizontal line), the distance is just the difference in x-coordinates. So D is at (2 - a, h), E is at ( (2 - a) - 2, h ), so x-coordinate is 2 -a -2 = -a. So the distance DE is | (2 -a) - (-a) | = |2| =2, which is correct. So yes, coordinates of E are (-a, h).\n\nNow, M is the midpoint of AE. Point A is at (0,0), E is at (-a, h). Midpoint M has coordinates:\n\nx: (0 + (-a))/2 = -a/2\n\ny: (0 + h)/2 = h/2\n\nSo coordinates of M are (-a/2, h/2).\n\nNow, all points A(0,0), B(4,0), C(2 + a, h), D(2 -a, h), and M(-a/2, h/2) lie on a circle with radius 5. Let's denote the circle's center as (p, q). The equation is (x - p)^2 + (y - q)^2 = 25.\n\nPlugging each point into this equation:\n\nFor A(0,0):\n\n(0 - p)^2 + (0 - q)^2 = p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =25 ...(1)\n\nFor B(4,0):\n\n(4 - p)^2 + (0 - q)^2 = (4 - p)^2 + q\u00b2 =25 ...(2)\n\nSubtract (1) from (2):\n\n(4 - p)^2 - p\u00b2 =0 \u21d216 -8p + p\u00b2 - p\u00b2 =16 -8p =0 \u21d28p =16 \u21d2p =2\n\nSo the center has x-coordinate 2. So center is (2, q).\n\nNow, plug into equation (1):\n\n2\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =25 \u21d24 + q\u00b2=25 \u21d2q\u00b2=21 \u21d2 q=\u00b1\u221a21\n\nProceeding. Let's note that.\n\nNow, let's plug in point D(2 -a, h):\n\n( (2 -a) -2 )\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 = (-a)^2 + (h - q)^2 = a\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25 ...(3)\n\nSimilarly, point C(2 +a, h):\n\n( (2 +a) -2 )\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 = (a)^2 + (h - q)^2 = same as equation (3). So consistent.\n\nPoint E(-a, h):\n\n( -a -2 )\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 = ( - (a +2) )\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 = (a +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25 ...(4)\n\nPoint M(-a/2, h/2):\n\n( -a/2 -2 )\u00b2 + ( h/2 - q )\u00b2 = ( - (a/2 +2) )\u00b2 + ( (h/2) - q )\u00b2 = (a/2 +2)^2 + ( (h/2 - q) )^2 =25 ...(5)\n\nNow, equations (3), (4), (5) are needed to solve for variables a, h, q (with q\u00b2=21, so q=\u00b1\u221a21). Let me note that.\n\nFirst, equations (3) and (4):\n\nFrom (3): a\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nFrom (4): (a +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nSubtract (3) from (4):\n\n(a +2)^2 - a\u00b2 =0 \u21d24a +4 =0 \u21d2a= -1\n\nBut wait, earlier we had that a>2 because CD length is 2a, and CD>4 \u21d2a>2. But here a=-1, which is impossible. So again, contradiction. Hmm, so that's a problem. What's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps my coordinate system has an issue with the direction of point E? Let me check again.\n\nIn this coordinate system, point D is at (2 -a, h). Since CD is from (2 -a, h) to (2 +a, h). So moving from D to C is in the positive x-direction. Therefore, if E is such that D is between E and C, then E must be on the extension beyond D away from C? Wait, no. If D is between E and C, then the order is E---D---C. So E must be on the opposite side of D from C, so in the direction opposite to C. Since moving from D to C is towards +x, moving from D away from C would be -x direction. So E is located at (2 -a -2, h) = ( -a, h ). Wait, but then the distance DE is the distance between (2 -a, h) and (-a, h). The x difference is (2 -a) - (-a)=2, so yes, DE =2, which is correct.\n\nBut in this setup, solving gives a = -1, which is impossible because a must be greater than 2, so that CD length 2a is greater than 4. Therefore, contradiction arises. So perhaps my coordinate system is flipped?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the center's y-coordinate is negative? Let me think. Since in this coordinate system, the upper base is at height h. Maybe h is negative? Wait, no, the problem doesn't specify the orientation, but usually trapezoid is drawn above the lower base, so h>0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the center is at (2, -\u221a21). Let me see.\n\nWait, since in equation (1): p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =25, with p=2, so q\u00b2=21, so q=\u00b1\u221a21. So maybe q is negative? Let me try that.\n\nSuppose q = -\u221a21. Let me see if that helps.\n\nProceeding with q= -\u221a21.\n\nThen, equations (3):\n\na\u00b2 + (h - (-\u221a21))\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + (h + \u221a21)^2 =25 ...(3)\n\nEquation (4):\n\n(a +2)^2 + (h + \u221a21)^2 =25 ...(4)\n\nSubtract (3) from (4):\n\n(a +2)^2 -a\u00b2 =0 \u21d24a +4=0 \u21d2a= -1 again. Same problem.\n\nHmm, so even with that, same result. So something is wrong here. Maybe I need to flip the direction of the trapezoid?\n\nWait, maybe I assigned the coordinates such that the upper base CD is to the right, but actually, it should be to the left? Wait, no. Wait, perhaps the height h is negative? Let me think. Let me try setting h as negative. Let me see.\n\nSuppose h is negative. Let me see.\n\nIf h is negative, then the upper base CD is below the lower base AB? That would make the trapezoid \"upside down\", but mathematically, it can still be an isosceles trapezoid. Let me try that.\n\nLet me proceed again with h negative. Let me reassign coordinates:\n\nA(0,0), B(4,0). Upper base CD is at (2 -a, h) and (2 +a, h), with h negative. Then CD length is still 2a>4, so a>2. The coordinates of E would still be (-a, h). \n\nFollowing through with equations (3) and (4):\n\na\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25,\n\n(a +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25,\n\nSubtract: 4a +4 =0 \u21d2a= -1. Still same problem. Hmm.\n\nHmm, so regardless of h's sign, a comes out as -1, which contradicts the requirement a>2. Therefore, there must be a fundamental flaw in my coordinate system setup. Maybe I made an incorrect assumption in the coordinates?\n\nWait, let me consider that perhaps the center of the circle is not on the y-axis? But in the first coordinate system, with points A(-2,0) and B(2,0), the center had to be on the y-axis because of symmetry. In the second coordinate system, points A(0,0) and B(4,0), the center ended up on the vertical line x=2. But in both cases, the problem arises when trying to satisfy the equations. Maybe the problem is in the way I defined point E?\n\nWait, let me go back to the problem statement again.\n\n\"Let E be a point on line CD such that DE=2 and D lies between E and C.\" So D is between E and C. That means the points are arranged E---D---C along the line CD. Therefore, the distance from E to D is 2, and from D to C is CD - DE? Wait, no, CD is the length between C and D, but if E is beyond D, then ED is separate. So CD is the length of the original base, which is 2a in my latest coordinate system. But in the problem, CD > AB =4. So CD is longer.\n\nWait, in my coordinate system, CD length is 2a. Then, in the problem, E is a point such that DE=2, so the total length from E to C would be ED + DC =2 + 2a? Wait no, actually, since E is on the line CD extended beyond D, the distance EC is ED + DC? Wait, no, if E---D---C, then EC = ED + DC? Wait no, EC is the distance from E to C, which is ED + DC? Wait ED is 2, DC is the length of CD, which is 2a, so EC would be ED + DC = 2 + 2a. Hmm, but that's not necessarily required, but perhaps important.\n\nWait, but in the equations, the problem arises when plugging in the points. Let me think differently. Maybe I need to use another approach instead of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since points A, B, C, D, M are concyclic, so the power of point M with respect to the circle is zero, but since it's on the circle, not sure. Alternatively, since M is the midpoint of AE, perhaps use properties of cyclic quadrilaterals or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinate system where the circle is centered at the origin? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me try using complex numbers. Maybe that could be another approach, but that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, think geometrically. Since ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid, it's cyclic? Wait, no, only isosceles trapezoid is cyclic if and only if it is isosceles, which it is, but wait, actually all isosceles trapezoids are cyclic quadrilaterals. Wait, yes! Wait, hold on, that's a key point. An isosceles trapezoid is always cyclic. Because in an isosceles trapezoid, the base angles are equal and supplementary, so they can be inscribed in a circle. Therefore, points A, B, C, D already lie on a circle. The problem states that points A,B,C,D, and M also lie on a circle with radius 5. So the original circle (circumcircle of the trapezoid) must be the same as the circle passing through M, and its radius is 5. So perhaps the problem is that we need to find the radius of the original trapezoid's circumcircle, but the problem says it's 5, so we can use that?\n\nWait, but in an isosceles trapezoid, the radius can be computed in terms of its sides and height. Maybe that's a path.\n\nWait, let me recall that for a cyclic trapezoid (which is isosceles), the radius can be found using the formula involving the sides.\n\nAlternatively, let me think that since ABCD is cyclic, then the distance from the center to each vertex is 5. So if I can find the center coordinates in terms of a and h, then set the distances equal to 5, and also set the midpoint M to satisfy the same.\n\nWait, perhaps going back to the coordinate system where points A(0,0), B(4,0), D(2 -a, h), C(2+a, h), M(-a/2, h/2), and center at (2, q). The problem is that when solving, we ended up with a =-1, which is impossible. So maybe I need to re-express equations differently?\n\nWait, let's try using the third equation, equation (5) for point M.\n\nEquation (5):\n\n( -a/2 -2 )\u00b2 + ( h/2 - q )\u00b2 =25\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nFirst term: ( - (a/2 + 2) )\u00b2 = (a/2 + 2)^2 = (a/2)^2 + 2*(a/2)*2 + 2^2 = (a\u00b2)/4 + 2a +4\n\nWait, actually, expanding ( -a/2 -2 )^2:\n\n= ( (-a/2 -2) )^2 = (a/2 + 2)^2 = (a/2)^2 + 2*(a/2)*2 + 2\u00b2 = (a\u00b2)/4 + 2a +4\n\nSecond term: ( h/2 - q )\u00b2 = ( (h - 2q)/2 )\u00b2 = (h - 2q)^2 /4\n\nSo equation (5):\n\n(a\u00b2)/4 + 2a +4 + ( (h - 2q)^2 ) /4 =25\n\nMultiply both sides by 4:\n\na\u00b2 + 8a +16 + (h - 2q)^2 =100\n\n=> a\u00b2 +8a + (h -2q)^2 =84 ...(5a)\n\nNow, equations (3):\n\na\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25 ...(3)\n\nEquation (4):\n\n(a +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25 ...(4)\n\nFrom equation (3) and (4), we had that a = -1, but that's conflicting with a>2.\n\nWait, so in this case, perhaps we can proceed with a=-1, even though it contradicts the CD length?\n\nWait, if a=-1, then CD length is 2a = -2, which is impossible. Therefore, the problem must have another condition that allows a to be positive?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a miscalculation in the equations.\n\nWait, let me re-express equations (3) and (4):\n\nFrom (3): a\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nFrom (4): (a +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nSubtract (3) from (4):\n\n(a+2)^2 -a\u00b2=4a +4=0 \u21d2a= -1.\n\nSo that's inescapable. Therefore, in this coordinate system, the only solution is a=-1, but that gives CD length negative? Wait, no, CD length is 2|a|. Since a is -1, then CD length is 2*|a|=2, but CD must be longer than AB=4, so 2 <4, which contradicts the problem's condition CD>AB. Therefore, this suggests that the current coordinate system is incompatible with the problem's conditions.\n\nHmm, so maybe my coordinate system is incorrect. Let me think of an alternative approach.\n\nPerhaps I made an error in the direction of point E? Let me re-examine the problem statement: \"Let E be a point on line CD such that DE=2 and D lies between E and C.\" So D is between E and C. So E is on the line CD extended beyond D away from C. Therefore, in the coordinate system where CD is from C to D, E is beyond D away from C. Wait, but in the coordinate system where CD is from left to right (C at left, D at right), then beyond D would be to the right. So in my first coordinate system where D is at (d, h), C is at (-d, h), so CD is from (-d,h) to (d,h). Then E would be to the right of D, at (d+2, h). Then in that coordinate system, solving gives d = ?\n\nWait let me try that coordinate system again:\n\nFirst coordinate system:\n\nA(-2,0), B(2,0), D(d, h), C(-d, h), E(d+2, h), M(d/2, h/2)\n\nCenter found at (0, q). Then equation for point D:\n\nd\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nPoint E:\n\n(d +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nSubtracting gives 4d +4 =0 \u21d2d= -1\n\nAgain, same problem. CD length is 2d, so with d=-1, CD length is -2, impossible. So again, contradiction.\n\nHmm. The problem is arising because in both coordinate systems tried, the solution for a or d is negative, contradicting CD>AB.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the center is not on the y-axis in the first coordinate system? Wait, in the first coordinate system with A(-2,0) and B(2,0), the center must lie on the y-axis because the circle must be symmetric with respect to the y-axis (since AB is symmetric, and the trapezoid is isosceles). Therefore, the center must lie on the y-axis. So that should be correct.\n\nWait, but then how come we can\u2019t get a valid a?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that point M is also on the circle. Without point M, the trapezoid is cyclic with center on the y-axis, but adding M imposes another condition which forces a to be negative, but the problem says CD>AB, so maybe the problem's conditions are only possible when the circle is not the original circumcircle of the trapezoid? But the problem states that all five points lie on a circle with radius 5, so it must be the same circle. Therefore, the problem's conditions only hold when a is negative, but CD length would then be smaller. But the problem says CD>AB. Therefore, perhaps the problem has no solution? But that can\u2019t be. The problem must have a solution.\n\nHmm, maybe the error is in my assumption that the trapezoid is convex? Or perhaps in the direction of the coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I assigned the coordinates of E incorrectly. Let me check again.\n\nIn the first coordinate system:\n\nPoints C(-d, h), D(d, h). Line CD goes from (-d, h) to (d, h). E is such that D is between E and C, so E must be on the line CD extended beyond D away from C. Since C is at (-d,h), going from C to D is towards increasing x. So beyond D would be further increasing x, so E is at (d+2, h). So DE distance is 2, which is correct.\n\nThen, the circle must pass through E(d+2, h). But when plugged in, the equations force d=-1, making CD=2d=-2, which is impossible. Therefore, contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the center is not on the y-axis? But in the first coordinate system, since points A and B are symmetric over the y-axis, the perpendicular bisector of AB is the y-axis, so the center must lie on the y-axis. Therefore, the center must be on the y-axis, so my previous calculation is correct. Therefore, the problem is contradictory unless we accept d=-1.\n\nWait, but if we accept d=-1, then CD length is 2d = -2, which is length 2, less than AB=4, which violates the problem's condition CD>AB. Therefore, there must be an error.\n\nWait, unless in my coordinate system, the coordinates of C and D are swapped? Suppose I took point C at (d, h) and D at (-d, h). Then CD length would be 2d, and if d>2, then CD>4. Then point E would be located on the line CD beyond D, so D is between E and C. Let me try this.\n\nLet me redefine coordinate system 1 with this swap:\n\nA(-2,0), B(2,0)\n\nC(d, h) and D(-d, h). So CD is from (d,h) to (-d, h), so length 2d. To have CD>AB=4, need 2d>4 \u21d2d>2.\n\nThen point E is on line CD such that D is between E and C. The line CD goes from C(d,h) to D(-d, h). To go beyond D away from C, so direction from C to D is toward -x. So beyond D is further in -x direction. So E would be located at (-d -2, h). Thus, DE distance is 2 units.\n\nCoordinates of E: (-d -2, h).\n\nMidpoint M of AE: A is (-2,0), E is (-d-2, h). Midpoint M has coordinates:\n\nx: [ -2 + (-d -2) ] /2 = (-d -4)/2\n\ny: [0 + h]/2 = h/2\n\nTherefore, M is at ( (-d -4)/2, h/2 )\n\nNow, let's write equations for the circle.\n\nCenter is on the y-axis (0, q) because of symmetry.\n\nEquation for point A(-2,0):\n\n(-2)^2 + (0 - q)^2 =4 + q\u00b2 =25 \u21d2q\u00b2=21 \u21d2 q=\u00b1\u221a21\n\nEquation for point D(-d, h):\n\n(-d)^2 + (h - q)^2 =d\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25 ...(1)\n\nEquation for point C(d, h):\n\nd\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25 same as (1)\n\nEquation for point E(-d -2, h):\n\n(-d -2)^2 + (h - q)^2 = (d +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25 ...(2)\n\nEquation for point M( (-d -4)/2, h/2 ):\n\n[ (-d -4)/2 -0 ]^2 + [ h/2 - q ]^2 = [ (d +4)/2 ]^2 + [ (h - 2q)/2 ]^2 =25\n\nLet me write equations (1) and (2):\n\nFrom (1): d\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nFrom (2): (d +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nSubtract (1) from (2):\n\n(d+2)^2 -d\u00b2 =4d +4 =0 \u21d24d +4 =0 \u21d2d= -1\n\nAgain, same issue. d=-1, which gives CD length 2d= -2, which is length 2, contradicting CD>AB=4.\n\nHmm. So regardless of swapping C and D, the result is the same. Therefore, there must be a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in three-dimensional space? No, it's a plane figure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my assumption of the coordinate system is wrong. Let me try a different coordinate system where AB is not centered.\n\nLet me try another coordinate system. Let me place point A at (0,0), B at (4,0). The trapezoid is isosceles, so legs AD and BC are symmetric about the vertical line through the midpoint of AB, which is (2,0). Therefore, points D and C must be placed symmetrically around x=2.\n\nTherefore, coordinates:\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of D as (2 - a, h) and C as (2 + a, h). So CD is from (2 - a, h) to (2 + a, h), so length CD=2a>4 \u21d2a>2.\n\nPoint E is on line CD such that D is between E and C. So starting from E, going through D to reach C. So E is located beyond D away from C. Since CD is from C (2 +a,h) to D (2 -a,h), moving from C to D is towards the left. So beyond D would be further left. Therefore, point E is located at (2 -a -2, h) = (2 -a -2, h) = ( -a, h )\n\nWait, coordinates of E are ( (2 -a) -2, h ) = ( -a, h ). Then DE distance is 2 units.\n\nMidpoint M of AE: A(0,0) and E(-a, h). Midpoint is ( (-a)/2, h/2 )\n\nSo coordinates of M are (-a/2, h/2 )\n\nTherefore, this is the same as the previous coordinate system, but with a different labeling. So equations are the same, leading to a =-1.\n\nSame problem. Thus, this suggests that in any coordinate system respecting the isosceles trapezoid with AB=4 and CD>4, the equations force a=-1 which violates CD>4. Therefore, this suggests either the problem has no solution, or there is a miscalculation.\n\nWait, but the problem states that such a configuration exists, so perhaps I made an error in the midpoint M?\n\nWait, midpoint of AE. If E is at (-a, h ), then yes, coordinates of M are (-a/2, h/2). That seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires MD, so even if a is -1, compute MD?\n\nWait, let's suppose that despite the contradiction, we proceed with a=-1. Then let's see what happens.\n\nIf a=-1, then:\n\nPoint D is at (2 - (-1), h ) = (3, h) ?\n\nWait no, wait in this coordinate system, if we have a=-1, then:\n\nWait in the coordinate system where D is (2 -a, h ), so with a=-1, D is (2 - (-1), h) = (3, h )\n\nSimilarly, point C is (2 +a, h)= (2 + (-1), h)= (1, h ). So CD length is distance between (3,h) and (1,h) is 2 units, which is less than AB=4, contradicting CD>AB. So this is impossible. Hence, invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the circle has radius 5, so even if the trapezoid is not convex? Or maybe the points are arranged differently?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the trapezoid is not convex? But isosceles trapezoid is convex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my assumption of the circle's center being on the perpendicular bisector is wrong because point M is not on that line?\n\nWait, in the coordinate system with A(0,0), B(4,0), then the perpendicular bisector of AB is the line x=2. The center must lie on x=2, but point M is at (-a/2, h/2 ). For the center to also accommodate point M, perhaps it's possible even if a is negative?\n\nWait, suppose a is negative. Let's say a=-b where b>0. Then the coordinates would be:\n\nD: (2 - (-b),h)=(2 +b, h)\n\nC: (2 + (-b),h)=(2 -b, h)\n\nThus CD length would be between (2 +b, h) and (2 -b, h) so distance is 2b. To have CD>4, need 2b>4 \u21d2b>2.\n\nPoint E would be located beyond D away from C. Since C is at (2 -b, h), moving from C to D is towards +x direction. Thus beyond D would be further +x. So E is at D's x +2, so coordinates (2 +b +2, h) = (4 +b, h)\n\nThen midpoint M of AE (A is (0,0), E is (4 +b, h) ) is at ( (4 +b)/2, h/2 )\n\nNow, let's see if this setup avoids the contradiction.\n\nLet me redefine with a = -b where b>2.\n\nSo:\n\nA(0,0), B(4,0), D(2 +b, h), C(2 -b, h), E(4 +b, h), M( (4 +b)/2, h/2 )\n\nNow, the circle must pass through all these points. Let's set up equations.\n\nCenter is at (2, q), since the perpendicular bisector of AB is x=2.\n\nEquation for point A(0,0):\n\n(0-2)^2 + (0 - q)^2 =4 + q\u00b2 =25 \u21d2 q\u00b2=21 \u21d2q=\u00b1\u221a21\n\nEquation for point D(2 +b, h):\n\n(2 +b -2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =b\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25 ...(1)\n\nEquation for point C(2 -b, h):\n\n(2 -b -2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =b\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 = same as (1). OK.\n\nEquation for point E(4 +b, h):\n\n(4 +b -2)^2 + (h - q)^2 = (2 +b)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25 ...(2)\n\nEquation for point M( (4 +b)/2, h/2 ):\n\n( (4 +b)/2 -2 )\u00b2 + ( h/2 - q )\u00b2 = ( (b -0)/2 )\u00b2 + ( (h - 2q)/2 )\u00b2 = (b\u00b2)/4 + ( (h -2q)^2 )/4 =25 ...(3)\n\nNow, equations (1) and (2):\n\nFrom (1): b\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nFrom (2): (b +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\nSubtract (1) from (2):\n\n(b+2)^2 - b\u00b2 =4b +4 =0 \u21d24b +4 =0 \u21d2b=-1\n\nBut b was defined as positive (since a =-b and a must be -b to get CD length 2b>4 \u21d2b>2). But here b=-1, which is negative, so this again gives a contradiction.\n\nHmm, so this approach also leads to a contradiction. This is perplexing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the center is not on the perpendicular bisector of AB? But since points A and B are symmetric about x=2, the center must lie on the perpendicular bisector. Since AB is horizontal from (0,0) to (4,0), the perpendicular bisector is vertical line x=2. So center must be on that line. So equations are unavoidable.\n\nTherefore, the problem seems impossible under the given conditions? But the problem says \"Given that points A,B,C,D, and M lie on a circle with radius 5\", so such a configuration exists, so my approach must be missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the trapezoid is not isosceles in the way I thought? Wait, no, the problem states it's an isosceles trapezoid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my coordinate assignments have an error in the position of E?\n\nWait, in this last coordinate system where a=-b, leading to points D at (2 +b, h), E at (4 +b, h). Then DE distance is (4 +b - (2 +b)) =2, which is correct. So that's okay.\n\nBut equations lead to b=-1, which is invalid. So perhaps there's a different configuration where E is on the other side?\n\nWait, let me consider that maybe in the problem statement, the point E is on the line CD but on the other side of D, i.e., between C and D? Wait, no, the problem states D lies between E and C, so E is on the extension beyond D away from C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the length DE is along the line CD but not along the straight line? No, DE is along line CD.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my mistake is in the midpoint's coordinates?\n\nWait, midpoint of AE: in the last coordinate system with A(0,0) and E(4 +b, h):\n\nMidpoint x-coordinate is (0 +4 +b)/2 = (4 +b)/2, yes.\n\nY-coordinate (0 +h)/2 =h/2. Correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the circle has radius 5, so even if the trapezoid is \"impossible\", we can proceed with a= -1 and compute MD?\n\nLet me see. Let's pretend that a=-1, even though it contradicts CD length.\n\nIn first coordinate system with A(-2,0), B(2,0), D(d, h)= (-1, h), C(-d, h)= (1, h). So CD length is 2 units, which is less than AB=4, but perhaps we can continue.\n\nPoint E is at (d +2, h)= (-1 +2, h)= (1, h). But point C is at (1, h). So E coincides with C. But the problem states that D is between E and C, which would mean E and C are the same point, which can't be. So invalid.\n\nAlternatively, in the second coordinate system with a=-1:\n\nA(0,0), B(4,0), D(2 +b, h)= (2 -1, h)=(1, h), C(2 -b, h)= (2 +1, h)= (3, h). So CD length is distance between (1,h) and (3,h)=2, again less than AB.\n\nE is at (4 +b, h)= (4 -1, h)=(3,h), which is point C again. Again, E coincides with C, which is invalid.\n\nThus, this is impossible. So why does the problem say such a configuration exists? Maybe my coordinate system is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the trapezoid is not symmetric about the vertical line through AB's midpoint? But the problem says it's isosceles, which requires symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the legs are the bases? Wait, no, in an isosceles trapezoid, the legs are the non-parallel sides. So bases are AB and CD.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I got AB and CD mixed up?\n\nWait, the problem says CD>AB=4. So CD is the longer base. So in the coordinate system, CD is the top base. So in my coordinate systems, the upper base is CD. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the height is negative? Let me suppose h is negative.\n\nLet me try in the coordinate system where A is (0,0), B is (4,0), D is (2 +b, h), C is (2 -b, h) with b>2, h negative.\n\nThen point E is at (4 +b, h). Midpoint M is ((4 +b)/2, h/2).\n\nEquations:\n\nCenter at (2, q). Equation for A: 4 + q\u00b2=25 \u21d2 q=\u00b1\u221a21.\n\nEquation for D: b\u00b2 + (h - q)^2=25.\n\nEquation for E: (b +2)^2 + (h - q)^2=25.\n\nSubtracting gives 4b +4=0 \u21d2b=-1.\n\nSame result.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the circle isn't centered on the perpendicular bisector? But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the trapezoid is not symmetric? But it's isosceles, so it must be symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the midpoint M is not on the same circle unless certain conditions are met, and the problem gives the radius as 5, so we have to find the correct a which somehow works?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider equation (3), which involves point M.\n\nIn the first coordinate system where we ended up with a=-1, let's see what happens with equation for M.\n\nSuppose we proceed with a=-1 and see what MD would be, even though it's contradictory.\n\nIn first coordinate system:\n\nA(-2,0), B(2,0), D(d, h)= (-1, h), C(1, h), E(d+2, h)= (-1 +2, h)= (1,h)=C.\n\nWhich is invalid as before.\n\nAlternatively, in the other coordinate system:\n\nLet me try to proceed with the equations even if they give a=-1. Let me see:\n\nLet me take a= -1. Then:\n\nFrom equation (1): a\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25 \u21d21 + (h - q)^2=25 \u21d2 (h - q)^2=24.\n\nEquation for point M:\n\nEquation (5a):\n\na\u00b2 +8a + (h -2q)^2 =84 \u21d21 + (-8) + (h -2q)^2 =84 \u21d2-7 + (h-2q)^2=84 \u21d2 (h -2q)^2=91\n\nSo (h - q)^2=24 and (h -2q)^2=91.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote x = h - q. Then x\u00b2=24.\n\nThen (h -2q) = (h -q) -q = x - q. Wait, but q is known in terms of the center.\n\nWait, we have q\u00b2=21 from equation (1). Since center is at (2, q).\n\nLet me write:\n\nFrom x = h - q \u21d2h = x + q.\n\nThen (h -2q) = (x + q) -2q =x - q.\n\nThus (x - q)^2 =91.\n\nWe also have x\u00b2 =24.\n\nSo expanding (x - q)^2 =x\u00b2 -2x q + q\u00b2 =24 -2x q +21 =45 -2x q =91 \u21d2 -2x q =91 -45=46 \u21d2 x q =-23.\n\nBut x\u00b2=24 \u21d2x=\u00b1\u221a24=\u00b12\u221a6.\n\nThus,\n\nx*q =-23 \u21d2 q = -23/x.\n\nThen:\n\nq\u00b2 = (23/x)^2 = 529/x\u00b2 \u21d2 but q\u00b2=21,\n\nThus 529/x\u00b2=21 \u21d2x\u00b2=529/21 \u21d2 but x\u00b2 is 24, so 529/21 \u224825.19, which is not 24. Contradiction.\n\nThus, no solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is perplexing. Perhaps I need to consider that the center of the circle is not on the perpendicular bisector of AB? But how?\n\nWait, if the circle passes through A, B, C, D and M, and the trapezoid is isosceles, but M is the midpoint of AE where E is an extension point, maybe the symmetry is broken, so the center isn't on the perpendicular bisector?\n\nWait, but AB is still symmetric. The points A and B are symmetric over x=2, so the center must still lie on the perpendicular bisector of AB, which is x=2. So that can't be changed.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the problem might have a typo or requires a different interpretation.\n\nWait, let me reread the problem statement:\n\n\"Let A B C D be an isosceles trapezoid such that C D>A B=4. Let E be a point on line C D such that D E=2 and D lies between E and C. Let M be the midpoint of A E. Given that points A,B,C,D, and M lie on a circle with radius 5, compute M D.\"\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. It says \"points A,B,C,D and M lie on a circle with radius 5\". So it's possible that the trapezoid's own circumcircle has a different radius, but with the addition of M, the circle's radius is 5. But in an isosceles trapezoid, the circumcircle exists with its own radius, and adding M might require a different circle.\n\nWait, but the problem states that all five points lie on a circle of radius 5. So this circle must be different from the original circumcircle of the trapezoid unless M is also on that original circle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trapezoid is not cyclic? Wait, but an isosceles trapezoid is cyclic. So the four points A,B,C,D must lie on a circle, and adding M requires that M also lies on that circle, which must have radius 5.\n\nThus, the original circle (circumcircle of the trapezoid) must have radius 5. So the problem is to find MD in such a case.\n\nBut in my calculations, this leads to a contradiction. Maybe the error is in assuming that the trapezoid is oriented with AB horizontal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the height of the trapezoid is such that when combined with the position of M, the radius becomes 5.\n\nWait, let me consider that in my coordinate system where the equations lead to a=-1, even though it contradicts CD length, but perhaps proceed formally to compute MD?\n\nIn the first coordinate system:\n\na=-1 \u21d2d=-1.\n\nCoordinates of D would be (d, h)= (-1, h).\n\nPoint M is (d/2, h/2)= (-0.5, h/2).\n\nThen MD is the distance between M(-0.5, h/2) and D(-1, h).\n\nCompute distance:\n\n\u0394x= -0.5 - (-1)=0.5\n\n\u0394y= h/2 - h = -h/2\n\nDistance MD= sqrt( (0.5)^2 + ( -h/2 )^2 )= sqrt(0.25 + h\u00b2/4 )\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\na\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25 \u21d21 + (h - q)^2=25 \u21d2 (h - q)^2=24\n\nAlso, center at (0, q). So for point D(-1,h):\n\nDistance to center squared is (-1)^2 + (h - q)^2 =1 +24=25, which holds.\n\nSo to compute MD, need to find h.\n\nFrom equation involving point M:\n\nCoordinates of M(-0.5, h/2):\n\nDistance to center (0,q):\n\n(-0.5)^2 + (h/2 - q)^2 =0.25 + ( (h/2 - q )^2 )=25.\n\nExpand (h/2 - q)^2 = ( (h - 2q)/2 )^2 = (h -2q)^2 /4.\n\nSo equation:\n\n0.25 + (h -2q)^2 /4 =25 \u21d2 (h -2q)^2 /4 =24.75 \u21d2 (h -2q)^2=99.\n\nAlso, from (h - q)^2 =24 \u21d2h - q=\u00b12\u221a6.\n\nLet me denote q=\u00b1\u221a21.\n\nWait, since center is at (0, q), with p=0, from first coordinate system:\n\nWait in first coordinate system, the center was at (0,q), with q\u00b2=21. So q=\u00b1\u221a21.\n\nLet me take q=\u221a21 first.\n\nThen:\n\nh - q= \u00b1\u221a24 \u21d2h= q \u00b1\u221a24.\n\nThus h=\u221a21 \u00b12\u221a6.\n\nThen (h -2q)^2:\n\nIf h=\u221a21 +2\u221a6,\n\nthen h -2q= \u221a21 +2\u221a6 -2\u221a21= -\u221a21 +2\u221a6.\n\nSquaring: ( -\u221a21 +2\u221a6 )\u00b2 =21 + 24 -4\u221a(21*6)=45 -4\u221a126=45 -4*3\u221a14=45-12\u221a14\u2248?\n\nNot sure, but compute (h -2q)^2:\n\nLet me compute:\n\nLet me compute (h -2q)^2 = ( (\u221a21 +2\u221a6) - 2\u221a21 )\u00b2 = (-\u221a21 + 2\u221a6)^2 = ( -\u221a21 )\u00b2 + (2\u221a6)^2 -2*(\u221a21)(2\u221a6)\n\n=21 + 24 -4\u221a(21*6)=45 -4\u221a126\n\n\u221a126=3\u221a14, so 4*3\u221a14=12\u221a14\n\nThus, (h-2q)^2=45 -12\u221a14\n\nBut we needed this to be 99. So 45 -12\u221a14 \u224845-12*3.7417\u224845-44.9\u22480.1, which is not 99. Not valid.\n\nAlternatively, h=\u221a21 -2\u221a6:\n\nThen h-2q= (\u221a21 -2\u221a6) -2\u221a21= -\u221a21 -2\u221a6\n\nSquaring gives 21 +24 +4\u221a(21*6)=45 +4\u221a126\u224845+44.9\u224889.9, which is near 90, not 99.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, q=-\u221a21.\n\nThen h - q= h +\u221a21=\u00b1\u221a24 \u21d2h= -\u221a21 \u00b12\u221a6.\n\nTake h= -\u221a21 +2\u221a6:\n\nThen h -2q= (-\u221a21 +2\u221a6) -2*(-\u221a21)= -\u221a21 +2\u221a6 +2\u221a21= \u221a21 +2\u221a6\n\nSquaring gives 21 +24 +4\u221a(21*6)=45+4\u221a126\u224845+44.9\u224889.9, not 99.\n\nh= -\u221a21 -2\u221a6:\n\nThen h-2q= (-\u221a21 -2\u221a6) -2*(-\u221a21)= -\u221a21 -2\u221a6 +2\u221a21= \u221a21 -2\u221a6\n\nSquaring gives 21 +24-4\u221a(21*6)=45-12\u221a14\u224845-44.9\u22480.1, not 99.\n\nThus, no solution here. So even if we proceed formally, the equations don't hold.\n\nHmm, this is really confusing. The problem must have a solution, so perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nLet me consider the fact that points A,B,C,D are cyclic. Since it's an isosceles trapezoid, its circumradius can be expressed in terms of its sides and height.\n\nThe formula for the circumradius R of an isosceles trapezoid with bases of length a and b, legs of length c, and height h is:\n\nR = \\sqrt{ ( (a/2)^2 + ( (b^2 - a^2)/(2b) )^2 ) } ?\n\nWait, perhaps I should look for a formula for the circumradius of an isosceles trapezoid.\n\nAlternatively, for any cyclic quadrilateral, the formula for the radius is:\n\nR = \\sqrt{ (ab + cd)(ac + bd)(ad + bc) } / (4K) )\n\nWhere a,b,c,d are the sides and K is the area. But this might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, for an isosceles trapezoid with bases AB=4, CD=2d (assuming my first coordinate system), legs AD and BC length sqrt(d\u00b2 + h\u00b2).\n\nThe radius R of its circumcircle can be found using the formula for a cyclic trapezoid:\n\nThe radius R = \\frac{\\sqrt{AB^2 + CD^2 + 4h^2}}{4} ?\n\nWait not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in the coordinate system where the center is at (0,q):\n\nThe points A(-2,0), B(2,0), D(d,h), C(-d,h).\n\nThen the radius is 5, so the distance from center (0,q) to A is sqrt( (0+2)^2 + (q-0)^2 ) = sqrt(4 + q\u00b2)=5 \u21d2 q\u00b2=21 \u21d2 q=\u00b1\u221a21.\n\nThe distance from center to D is sqrt(d\u00b2 + (h - q)^2)=5 \u21d2d\u00b2 + (h - q)^2=25.\n\nThe distance from center to M (d/2, h/2) must also be 5:\n\nsqrt( (d/2)^2 + (h/2 - q)^2 ) =5 \u21d2 (d\u00b2)/4 + ( (h/2 - q)^2 ) =25.\n\nLet me write these equations:\n\n1. d\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 =25\n\n2. (d\u00b2)/4 + ( (h/2 - q)^2 ) =25\n\nLet me expand the second equation:\n\n(d\u00b2)/4 + ( (h/2 - q)^2 ) = (d\u00b2)/4 + ( (h - 2q)/2 )^2 = (d\u00b2)/4 + (h -2q)^2 /4 =25\n\nMultiply by 4:\n\nd\u00b2 + (h -2q)^2 =100 ...(2a)\n\nNow, from equation 1: d\u00b2 =25 - (h - q)^2\n\nSubstitute into equation (2a):\n\n25 - (h - q)^2 + (h -2q)^2 =100\n\nExpand (h -2q)^2 - (h - q)^2:\n\n= [h\u00b2 -4hq +4q\u00b2] - [h\u00b2 -2hq +q\u00b2] = (-4hq +4q\u00b2) - (-2hq +q\u00b2) = -2hq +3q\u00b2\n\nThus,\n\n25 + (-2hq +3q\u00b2) =100 \u21d2-2hq +3q\u00b2 =75\n\nBut from equation 1, (h - q)^2 =25 -d\u00b2, but maybe express h in terms of q.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote x = h - q, so h =x + q.\n\nThen substitute into above equation:\n\n-2q(x + q) +3q\u00b2 =75 \u21d2-2q x -2q\u00b2 +3q\u00b2 = -2q x + q\u00b2 =75\n\nBut also from equation 1: x\u00b2 =25 -d\u00b2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, with h =x + q,\n\nThen equation -2q x + q\u00b2 =75.\n\nBut I need another relation.\n\nAlternatively, let me look for another equation between h and q.\n\nWe also have the point E is on CD such that DE=2. In this coordinate system:\n\nPoint D is (d, h), so E is (d+2, h).\n\nThe distance from center (0,q) to E must also be 5:\n\nsqrt( (d+2)^2 + (h - q)^2 ) =5 \u21d2 (d+2)^2 + (h - q)^2 =25.\n\nBut from equation 1, (h - q)^2=25 -d\u00b2. Substitute:\n\n(d+2)^2 +25 -d\u00b2=25 \u21d2 (d\u00b2 +4d +4) +25 -d\u00b2 =25 \u21d24d +4=0 \u21d2d= -1.\n\nThus, again, d=-1.\n\nSo even with this approach, we end up with d=-1, which is problematic because CD length is 2|d|=2, violating CD>AB=4.\n\nHence, this suggests that the problem's conditions are impossible unless we allow a negative length, which is not physical.\n\nBut since the problem states such a configuration exists, perhaps I misinterpret the problem's configuration.\n\nWait, the problem says \"Let E be a point on line CD such that DE=2 and D lies between E and C.\"\n\nMaybe \"lies between\" is interpreted differently. Perhaps E is between D and C? Then D is between E and C would require E to be between D and C, so D-E-C. So DE + EC = DC. Then, DE=2, so EC= DC -2. Thus, in that case, E is between D and C, so coordinates accordingly.\n\nAh! This might be the key.\n\nI think I misread the problem's condition. The problem says \"D lies between E and C\", which means the order is E---D---C. So E is on the line CD extended beyond D away from C. But perhaps I've misapplied the direction.\n\nWait, but if E is between D and C, then the order is E-D-C, but D is between E and C only if E is on the other side.\n\nWait, the wording is: \"D lies between E and C\". So when moving from E to C, you pass through D. Therefore, the order must be E---D---C. Therefore, E is on the side of D opposite to C.\n\nTherefore, my previous analysis is correct, but then the problem's conditions are conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said \"E lies between D and C\", then the order would be D-E-C, but the problem states D is between E and C.\n\nHmm. Since the problem is from an Olympiad, perhaps there is a different configuration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the trapezoid is not convex? But isosceles trapezoid is convex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the midpoint M is not as I calculated?\n\nWait, let's try to think differently. Let me suppose that the circle has radius 5, and find MD through geometric relations.\n\nLet me consider coordinates again but more carefully.\n\nLet me try to set coordinate system with center of the circle at (0,0). Then points A,B,C,D,M are all at distance 5 from (0,0).\n\nLet me assume the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis. Let me set:\n\nLet AB be horizontal, with A(-a, b) and B(a, b), but wait, maybe better to set AB along x-axis with midpoint at origin.\n\nWait, since it's an isosceles trapezoid, let me set the center of the circle at the origin for simplicity.\n\nLet me suppose the trapezoid is symmetric about the y-axis. Let me denote coordinates:\n\nLet AB be the lower base, with A(-c, -d) and B(c, -d), so AB length is 2c, which is given as AB=4 \u21d2 2c=4 \u21d2c=2. So A(-2, -d), B(2, -d).\n\nThe upper base CD is longer, so let me denote points C(-e, h) and D(e, h), so CD length is 2e, and since CD>AB=4 \u21d22e>4 \u21d2e>2.\n\nThe legs are AD and BC, which are equal in length.\n\nCoordinates:\n\nA(-2, -d), D(e, h). The length AD is sqrt( (e+2)^2 + (h +d)^2 )\n\nSimilarly, BC is sqrt( (e-2)^2 + (h +d)^2 ). Since it's isosceles, legs are equal, so:\n\n(e+2)^2 + (h +d)^2 = (e-2)^2 + (h +d)^2 \u21d2 (e+2)^2 = (e-2)^2 \u21d2 expanding:\n\ne\u00b2 +4e +4 = e\u00b2 -4e +4 \u21d28e=0 \u21d2e=0, which contradicts e>2.\n\nHmm, so this coordinate system has a problem. Because requiring legs equal forces e=0.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the trapezoid is rotated?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trapezoid is placed such that its bases are vertical?\n\nWait, perhaps the trapezoid is symmetric about the x-axis instead?\n\nLet me try another coordinate system where the trapezoid is symmetric about the x-axis.\n\nLet me place the lower base CD on the lower part and upper base AB on the upper part. Let me set:\n\nPoints C and D on the lower base, symmetric about the y-axis: C(-e, -h), D(e, -h), so CD length 2e.\n\nPoints A and B on the upper base: A(-f, k), B(f, k), so AB length 2f=4 \u21d2f=2.\n\nThe legs are AD and BC.\n\nAD connects A(-2,k) to D(e, -h). The length AD is sqrt( (e+2)^2 + ( -h -k )^2 )\n\nBC connects B(2,k) to C(-e, -h): sqrt( (-e -2)^2 + (-h -k)^2 )\n\nFor isosceles trapezoid, legs must be equal:\n\nsqrt( (e+2)^2 + (h +k)^2 ) = sqrt( (e+2)^2 + (h +k)^2 ) same as the first term, so symmetric. Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, coordinates:\n\nAD: from (-2,k) to (e,-h): \u0394x = e+2, \u0394y= -h -k.\n\nBC: from (2,k) to (-e, -h): \u0394x= -e-2, \u0394y= -h -k.\n\nThus, lengths squared:\n\n(e+2)^2 + (h +k)^2 and (e+2)^2 + (h +k)^2. So they are equal. Thus, this is okay.\n\nThus, this is symmetric.\n\nNow, set the circle's center at the origin (0,0), radius 5.\n\nThus, all points lie on x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=25.\n\nTherefore,\n\nFor point A(-2, k): (-2)^2 +k\u00b2=25 \u21d2k\u00b2=21 \u21d2k=\u00b1\u221a21\n\nSimilarly for B(2,k): same.\n\nFor point C(-e, -h): e\u00b2 + h\u00b2=25\n\nFor point D(e, -h): same.\n\nFor point E: need to define E.\n\nWait, the problem states:\n\nLet E be a point on line CD such that DE=2 and D lies between E and C.\n\nPoints C(-e, -h) and D(e, -h). The line CD is the line from C(-e, -h) to D(e, -h). The direction from C to D is along positive x-axis. Since D is between E and C, the points are arranged E---D---C.\n\nThus, E is located to the left of D, extending from D away from C. So moving from D(e, -h) in the direction opposite to C (which is towards negative x), so E has coordinates (e -2, -h).\n\nMidpoint M of AE: A is (-2,k), E is (e-2, -h). Midpoint coordinates:\n\nx: [ -2 + e -2 ] /2 = (e -4)/2\n\ny: [k + (-h) ] /2 = (k - h)/2\n\nPoint M must lie on the circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=25.\n\nThus:\n\n[(e -4)/2]^2 + [(k - h)/2]^2 =25 \u21d2 [(e -4)^2 + (k - h)^2]/4 =25 \u21d2 (e -4)^2 + (k - h)^2 =100 ...(1)\n\nAlso, points C and D are on the circle:\n\ne\u00b2 + h\u00b2=25 ...(2)\n\nPoints A and B are on the circle with k\u00b2=21 ...(3)\n\nEquations (2) and (3) are known.\n\nWe need to find e, h, k such that equation (1) holds.\n\nWe also know that CD length is 2e>4 \u21d2e>2.\n\nAdditionally, since the trapezoid is isosceles, the legs AD and BC must have the same length, which they already do in this setup.\n\nNow, let's proceed.\n\nLet me note that k\u00b2=21 \u21d2k=\u00b1\u221a21. Let's assume k is positive (upper base is above the x-axis).\n\nSo k=\u221a21.\n\nEquation (1):\n\n(e -4)^2 + (\u221a21 - h)^2 =100 ...(1)\n\nEquation (2): e\u00b2 + h\u00b2=25 ...(2)\n\nLet me expand equation (1):\n\n(e\u00b2 -8e +16) + (21 - 2\u221a21 h + h\u00b2) =100\n\nCombine terms:\n\ne\u00b2 + h\u00b2 -8e +16 +21 -2\u221a21 h =100\n\nFrom equation (2), e\u00b2 + h\u00b2=25, so substitute:\n\n25 -8e +37 -2\u221a21 h =100 \u21d2 (25+37) -8e -2\u221a21 h =100 \u21d262 -8e -2\u221a21 h =100 \u21d2-8e -2\u221a21 h=38 \u21d24e +\u221a21 h =-19 ...(4)\n\nNow, equation (2): e\u00b2 + h\u00b2=25.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\nEquation (2): e\u00b2 + h\u00b2=25\n\nEquation (4):4e +\u221a21 h =-19\n\nWe can solve for h from equation (4):\n\n\u221a21 h = -19 -4e \u21d2 h= (-19 -4e)/\u221a21\n\nSubstitute into equation (2):\n\ne\u00b2 + [ (-19 -4e)^2 /21 ] =25\n\nMultiply both sides by 21:\n\n21e\u00b2 + (19 +4e)^2 =525\n\nExpand (19+4e)^2= 361 + 152e +16e\u00b2\n\nThus,\n\n21e\u00b2 +361 +152e +16e\u00b2 =525 \u21d237e\u00b2 +152e +361 -525=0 \u21d237e\u00b2 +152e -164=0\n\nNow, solving quadratic equation 37e\u00b2 +152e -164=0\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\ne = [ -152 \u00b1\u221a(152\u00b2 -4*37*(-164) ) ]/(2*37)\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\nD=152\u00b2 +4*37*164\n\n152\u00b2=23104\n\n4*37=148; 148*164=148*(160+4)=148*160 +148*4=23680 +592=24272\n\nThus D=23104 +24272=47376\n\n\u221aD=\u221a47376. Let me see:\n\n217\u00b2=47089, 218\u00b2=47524. So between 217 and 218.\n\nCompute 217.5\u00b2= (217 +0.5)^2=217\u00b2 +217 +0.25=47089+217+0.25=47306.25 <47376\n\n218\u00b2=47524>47376.\n\nCompute 217.6\u00b2=217\u00b2 + 2*217*0.6 +0.6\u00b2=47089+260.4+0.36=47349.76\n\n217.7\u00b2=47349.76 +2*217*0.1 +0.1\u00b2=47349.76 +43.4 +0.01=47393.17, which exceeds.\n\nSo sqrt(47376)\u2248217.65\n\nThus,\n\ne= [ -152 \u00b1217.65 ] /74\n\nWe need e>2, so take the positive solution:\n\ne= ( -152 +217.65 ) /74 \u224865.65/74\u22480.887, which is less than 2. Not valid.\n\nThe other solution:\n\ne= (-152 -217.65)/74\u2248-369.65/74\u2248-4.995, which is negative. Disregard.\n\nThus no solution with k=\u221a21.\n\nNow try with k=-\u221a21, so k is negative (upper base below the x-axis? Wait, but then the trapezoid would be upside-down. Let me see.\n\nIf k=-\u221a21, then points A(-2,k)=(-2,-\u221a21), B(2,-\u221a21), which are below the x-axis.\n\nThen the upper base CD is at y=-h (from points C and D at (e,-h)).

What's going on?\n\nWait, maybe the center is not at (0,0). I assumed center at origin for simplicity, but maybe it's elsewhere.\n\nLet me try another coordinate system where the center is at (p, q). Since points A,B,C,D,M are all on the circle with radius 5.\n\nLet me try to set AB horizontally again, with A(-2,0), B(2,0). Let me denote the center as (0, q) due to symmetry.\n\nThen, as before:\n\nq\u00b2 +4=25 \u21d2 q\u00b2=21.\n\nPoints D(d, h) and C(-d, h).\n\nEquation for D: d\u00b2 + (h - q)^2=25.\n\nPoint E(d+2, h).\n\nEquation for E: (d+2)^2 + (h - q)^2=25 \u21d2 gives d=-1.\n\nThen, point M is (d/2, h/2)= (-0.5, h/2).\n\nEquation for M: (-0.5)^2 + (h/2 - q)^2=25 \u21d20.25 + (h/2 - q)^2=25 \u21d2 (h/2 - q)^2=24.75 \u21d2 (h/2 - q)=\u00b1\u221a24.75.\n\nBut from point D's equation: (h - q)^2=25 -d\u00b2=25-1=24 \u21d2h - q=\u00b1\u221a24.\n\nLet me let\u2019s set q =\u221a21.\n\nThen h - q=\u00b1\u221a24 \u21d2h= q \u00b1\u221a24.\n\nCompute h/2 - q:\n\nCase 1: h = q +\u221a24\n\nThen h/2 - q = (q +\u221a24)/2 -q = (-q)/2 + \u221a24/2\n\nSquare: ( (-q/2)^2 + (\u221a24/2)^2 + 2*(-q/2)(\u221a24/2) )= (q\u00b2)/4 + 24/4 - (q\u221a24)/2.\n\nBut this must equal 24.75=99/4.\n\nBut q\u00b2=21,\n\nThus,\n\n21/4 +6 - (q\u221a24)/2 = (21 +24)/4 - (q\u221a24)/2 =45/4 - (q\u221a24)/2 =24.75 ?\n\nWait, 45/4=11.25, 24.75-11.25=13.5=27/2.\n\nThus,\n\n- (q\u221a24)/2 =27/2 \u21d2 -q\u221a24=27 \u21d2 q= -27/(\u221a24)= -27/(2\u221a6)= -9\u221a6/4\u2248-5.612.\n\nBut q was supposed to be sqrt(21)=\u22484.583, so contradiction.\n\nCase 2: h= q -\u221a24,\n\nThen h/2 - q = (q -\u221a24)/2 - q = (-q)/2 -\u221a24/2.\n\nSquare: ( (-q/2)^2 + (\u221a24/2)^2 + 2*(-q/2)(-\u221a24/2) )= q\u00b2/4 +6 + (q\u221a24)/2.\n\nSet equal to 24.75:\n\nq\u00b2/4 +6 + (q\u221a24)/2 =24.75 \u21d2 (21)/4 +6 + (q\u221a24)/2 =24.75 \u21d2 (21+24)/4 + (q\u221a24)/2 =24.75 \u21d245/4 + (q\u221a24)/2 =24.75 \u21d2\n\n45/4 =11.25 \u21d224.75 -11.25=13.5=27/2= (q\u221a24)/2 \u21d2 q\u221a24=27 \u21d2q=27/\u221a24=27/(2\u221a6)= (9\u221a6)/4\u22485.612.\n\nBut q must be sqrt(21)=\u22484.583, so this also impossible.\n\nThus, again, no solution.\n\nThis suggests that the problem's conditions are impossible unless we relax the isosceles trapezoid's properties or there's a calculation mistake.\n\nBut the problem states it exists, so I must have made an error.\n\nWait, the problem says \"isosceles trapezoid\", which requires legs equal and bases parallel. Maybe I assumed the wrong orientation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trapezoid is not symmetric about the y-axis but another axis?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the height h is such that when combined with the midpoint M, the circle's radius becomes 5 despite the contradiction.\n\nWait, perhaps the distance MD can be computed without resolving the inconsistency?\n\nIn the first coordinate system with d=-1:\n\nPoint D is at (-1, h)\n\nPoint M is at (-0.5, h/2)\n\nThus, MD squared is ( (-1 +0.5)^2 + (h - h/2)^2 )= (0.5)^2 + (h/2)^2 =0.25 + (h\u00b2)/4.\n\nFrom point D equation: (-1)^2 + (h - q)^2=25 \u21d21 + (h - q)^2=25 \u21d2(h - q)^2=24.\n\nFrom point M's equation: (-0.5)^2 + (h/2 - q)^2=25 \u21d20.25 + ( (h - 2q)/2 )^2=25 \u21d2(h - 2q)^2 = 99.\n\nThus:\n\nLet me compute MD squared:0.25 + (h\u00b2)/4.\n\nExpress h\u00b2 in terms of (h - q)^2 and q:\n\n(h - q)^2 =h\u00b2 -2hq + q\u00b2=24 \u21d2h\u00b2=24 +2hq - q\u00b2.\n\nThus,\n\nMD squared=0.25 + (24 +2hq - q\u00b2)/4 =0.25 +6 + (hq)/2 - (q\u00b2)/4 =6.25 + (hq)/2 - (21)/4.\n\nBecause q\u00b2=21.\n\nSo 6.25 -5.25 + (hq)/2=1 + (hq)/2.\n\nAlso, from (h -2q)^2=99 \u21d2h\u00b2 -4hq +4q\u00b2=99.\n\nSubstitute h\u00b2=24 +2hq - q\u00b2,\n\n24 +2hq - q\u00b2 -4hq +4q\u00b2=99 \u21d224 -2hq +3q\u00b2=99 \u21d2-2hq +3q\u00b2=75.\n\nFrom this, -2hq=75-3q\u00b2 \u21d2hq=(3q\u00b2 -75)/2.\n\nSubstitute into MD squared expression:\n\n1 + (hq)/2 =1 + (3q\u00b2 -75)/4 = (4 +3q\u00b2 -75)/4 = (3q\u00b2 -71)/4.\n\nBut q\u00b2=21,\n\nThus, MD squared= (3*21 -71)/4=(63-71)/4=(-8)/4=-2.\n\nImpossible, distance squared negative. Thus impossible.\n\nThis confirms impossibility.\n\nBut the problem says such a configuration exists. I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, re-reading the problem:\n\n\"Let A B C D be an isosceles trapezoid such that C D>A B=4. Let E be a point on line C D such that D E=2 and D lies between E and C. Let M be the midpoint of A E. Given that points A,B,C,D, and M lie on a circle with radius 5, compute M D.\"\n\nWait, perhaps \"line CD\" means the line extending CD, and E is on that line, not necessarily the segment CD. Which is what I assumed.\n\nAlternatively, the mistake is in the assumption that the trapezoid is convex? If it's concave, but an isosceles trapezoid is convex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the midpoint M is not of AE but of AD? No, problem says AE.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires MD in terms of the circle's radius? But the answer is numerical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the center is not on the perpendicular bisector of AB because point M breaks the symmetry?\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet me define coordinate system with A(0,0), B(4,0). Let D be (a, h), C is symmetric (4 -a, h). Then CD length is (4 -a -a)=4-2a? Wait, no, coordinates would need to be consistent.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to set coordinates without assuming symmetry.\n\nLet me let AB be from A(0,0) to B(4,0). Let the legs be AD and BC, with D somewhere above and to the left, C above and to the right.\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nLet me let D be (d_x, h), C be (c_x, h), so CD is between them, parallel to AB.\n\nThe trapezoid is isosceles, so the legs AD and BC have equal length and the trapezoid is symmetric about the vertical line through the midpoint of AB, which is (2,0). Thus, D must be (2 - s, h), and C must be (2 + s, h), so CD length is 2s>4 \u21d2 s>2.\n\nPoint E is on line CD beyond D away from C. Thus, coordinates of E would be (2 -s -2, h) = ( -s, h )\n\nWait, moving from D(2 -s, h) in the direction away from C (which is towards decreasing x), so subtract 2 from x-coordinate:\n\nE_x = (2 -s) -2 = -s.\n\nThus E is at (-s, h).\n\nMidpoint M of AE: A(0,0) and E(-s, h). Midpoint is (-s/2, h/2).\n\nNow, all points A(0,0), B(4,0), C(2+s, h), D(2-s, h), M(-s/2, h/2) lie on a circle of radius 5.\n\nLet me denote the circle's center as (p, q).\n\nEquations:\n\nFor A(0,0):\n\n(p)^2 + q^2 =25 ...(1)\n\nFor B(4,0):\n\n(p-4)^2 + q^2 =25 ...(2)\n\nSubtract (1) from (2):\n\n(p-4)^2 - p^2 =0 \u21d2-8p +16=0 \u21d2p=2.\n\nThus center is at (2, q). Plug into (1):\n\n4 + q\u00b2=25 \u21d2q\u00b2=21 \u21d2q=\u00b1\u221a21.\n\nEquation for D(2 -s, h):\n\n( (2 -s -2)^2 + (h - q)^2 )= s\u00b2 + (h - q)^2=25 ...(3)\n\nEquation for C(2 +s, h):\n\nsame as (3).\n\nEquation for E(-s, h):\n\n( (-s -2)^2 + (h - q)^2 )= (s +2)^2 + (h - q)^2=25 ...(4)\n\nEquation for M(-s/2, h/2):\n\n( (-s/2 -2)^2 + (h/2 - q)^2 )= ( ( - (s/2 +2) )^2 + ( (h - 2q)/2 )^2 = (s/2 +2)^2 + ( (h -2q)/2 )^2 =25 ...(5)\n\nNow, equations (3) and (4):\n\nFrom (3) and (4):\n\ns\u00b2 + (h - q)^2 = (s +2)^2 + (h - q)^2 \u21d2s\u00b2 = (s +2)^2 \u21d2s\u00b2 =s\u00b2 +4s +4 \u21d24s +4=0 \u21d2s= -1.\n\nWhich again gives s=-1, contradicting s>2.\n\nThus, this approach also leads to s=-1.\n\nTherefore, the problem's conditions are impossible under standard interpretations. This must mean there is a different interpretation or a mistake in the problem's statement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the trapezoid is not isosceles in the way I thought. Wait, no, problem states it's isosceles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point E is on the other side, such that C is between E and D?\n\nIf C is between E and D, then DE would be longer than CD. But problem says D is between E and C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows for a degenerate circle? Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my calculation of MD in the impossible case yields the answer despite the contradiction?\n\nIf s=-1,\n\nthen s=-1, so coordinates:\n\nD is (2 - (-1), h)=(3, h).\n\nC is (2 + (-1), h)=(1, h).\n\nThus CD length is 2 units, violating CD>AB=4.\n\nPoint E is at (-s, h)= (1, h), which coincides with point C.\n\nThus, midpoint M of AE where E=C is midpoint of AC: A(0,0), C(1,h).\n\nCoordinates of M: (0.5, h/2).\n\nCompute MD: distance from M(0.5, h/2) to D(3,h).\n\n\u0394x=2.5, \u0394y=h/2.\n\nDistance squared:6.25 + (h\u00b2)/4.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\ns\u00b2 + (h -q)^2=25 \u21d21 + (h - q)^2=25 \u21d2 (h - q)^2=24.\n\nFrom equation involving M:\n\nEquation (5):\n\n(s/2 +2)^2 + ( (h -2q)/2 )\u00b2=25 with s=-1:\n\n(-0.5 +2)^2 + ( (h-2q)/2 )\u00b2 = (1.5)^2 + ( (h-2q)/2 )\u00b2 =2.25 + [(h-2q)^2]/4 =25 \u21d2 (h-2q)^2= (25-2.25)*4= 22.75*4=91.\n\nThus,\n\n(h -q)^2=24,\n\n(h-2q)^2=91.\n\nLet me set x = h - q,\n\nthen (h -2q)= (h -q) - q =x - q.\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2=24,\n\n(x - q)^2=91,\n\nAlso, q\u00b2=21.\n\nExpand second equation:\n\nx\u00b2 -2xq + q\u00b2=91.\n\nSubstitute x\u00b2=24,\n\n24 -2xq +21=91 \u21d2 -2xq=91-45=46 \u21d2xq= -23.\n\nThus,\n\nx= h - q,\n\nand xq= -23,\n\nand x\u00b2=24 \u21d2x=\u00b12\u221a6.\n\nThus,\n\nq= -23/x.\n\nThen q\u00b2= (529)/(x\u00b2)=529/24 \u224822.04, but q\u00b2 must be 21.\n\nContradiction.\n\nThus, impossibility.\n\nTherefore, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps the answer is 2? Or sqrt(5\u00b2 - something).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is sqrt(21 - 4) = sqrt(17) or something, but I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the impossible case, MD is sqrt( (d/2)^2 + (h/2)^2 )?\n\nWait, in the coordinate system where d=-1,\n\nMD squared is ( (-1 - (-0.5) )^2 + (h - h/2)^2 )= ( -0.5)^2 + (h/2)^2 =0.25 + (h\u00b2)/4.\n\nFrom equation (3):\n\nd\u00b2 + (h - q)^2=1 + (h - q)^2=25 \u21d2 (h - q)^2=24 \u21d2h\u00b2 -2hq +q\u00b2=24.\n\nAnd q\u00b2=21, so h\u00b2-2hq= 24 -21=3 \u21d2h\u00b2=2hq +3.\n\nThus,\n\nMD squared=0.25 + (2hq +3)/4=0.25 +0.5hq +0.75=1 +0.5hq.\n\nFrom equation (5a):\n\na= -1,\n\nEquation (5a):\n\na\u00b2 +8a + (h-2q)^2=1 -8 + (h-2q)^2= -7 + (h-2q)^2=84 \u21d2(h-2q)^2=91,\n\nWhich expands to h\u00b2-4hq +4q\u00b2=91,\n\nSubstitute h\u00b2=2hq+3,\n\n(2hq+3) -4hq +4*21=91 \u21d2-2hq +3 +84=91 \u21d2-2hq=4 \u21d2hq=-2.\n\nThus,\n\nMD squared=1 +0.5*(-2)=1-1=0 \u21d2MD=0.\n\nBut that would mean points M and D coincide, which is impossible.\n\nThis is truly perplexing. Since the problem is from an Olympiad, there must be a solution. I must have made a wrong assumption.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nPerhaps the trapezoid is not placed with AB horizontal, but at an angle?\n\nLet me try a different coordinate system.\n\nLet me consider placing the trapezoid such that AB is not horizontal, but this might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the circle first.\n\nLet the circle has radius 5. Let me suppose points A and B are at (-2,0) and (2,0), so AB=4. Then the circle has center at (0, q) with q\u00b2 +4=25 \u21d2q=\u00b1\u221a21.\n\nLet me assume center at (0,\u221a21).\n\nPoints C and D are also on the circle, forming an isosceles trapezoid with AB.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of D as (x,y), then C must be (-x,y) to maintain symmetry.\n\nThus CD length is 2x>4 \u21d2x>2.\n\nPoint E is on line CD beyond D away from C, so coordinates of E would be (x +2, y).\n\nMidpoint M of AE: A(-2,0) and E(x+2,y), so coordinates of M:\n\nx_M=( -2 +x +2)/2 =x/2,\n\ny_M=(0 +y)/2= y/2.\n\nThus M is (x/2, y/2).\n\nThis point must lie on the circle:\n\n(x/2)^2 + (y/2 -\u221a21)^2 =25,\n\nMultiply by4:\n\nx\u00b2 + (y - 2\u221a21)^2=100.\n\nAlso, point D(x,y) is on the circle:\n\nx\u00b2 + (y -\u221a21)^2=25.\n\nSubtract the two equations:\n\n[x\u00b2 + (y -2\u221a21)^2] - [x\u00b2 + (y -\u221a21)^2] =75 \u21d2\n\n(y\u00b2 -4\u221a21 y + (2\u221a21)^2 ) - (y\u00b2 -2\u221a21 y + (\u221a21)^2 )=75 \u21d2\n\n(-4\u221a21 y +4*21) - (-2\u221a21 y +21)=75 \u21d2\n\n-4\u221a21 y +84 +2\u221a21 y -21 =75 \u21d2\n\n-2\u221a21 y +63 =75 \u21d2-2\u221a21 y =12 \u21d2y= -12/(2\u221a21)= -6/\u221a21= -2\u221a21/7.\n\nThus y= -2\u221a21/7.\n\nNow, substitute y into point D's equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + (y -\u221a21)^2=25 \u21d2x\u00b2 + ( -2\u221a21/7 -\u221a21 )^2=25.\n\nSimplify the y-term:\n\n-2\u221a21/7 -7\u221a21/7= (-9\u221a21)/7.\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + ( (-9\u221a21)/7 )^2 =25 \u21d2x\u00b2 + (81*21)/49=25 \u21d2x\u00b2 + (1701)/49=25 \u21d2x\u00b2=25 -34.714\u2248-9.714 impossible.\n\nHmm, no solution.\n\nAlternatively, take center at (0,-\u221a21):\n\nThen equations:\n\nFor point D(x,y):\n\nx\u00b2 + (y +\u221a21)^2=25.\n\nPoint M(x/2, y/2):\n\n(x/2)^2 + ( y/2 +\u221a21 )^2 =25 \u21d2x\u00b2/4 + (y/2 +\u221a21)^2=25.\n\nMultiply by4:\n\nx\u00b2 + (y +2\u221a21)^2=100.\n\nSubtract point D's equation:\n\n[x\u00b2 + (y +2\u221a21)^2] - [x\u00b2 + (y +\u221a21)^2] =75 \u21d2\n\n(y\u00b2 +4\u221a21 y + (2\u221a21)^2 ) - (y\u00b2 +2\u221a21 y + (\u221a21)^2 )=75 \u21d2\n\n2\u221a21 y +3*21=75 \u21d22\u221a21 y=75-63=12 \u21d2 y= 12/(2\u221a21)=6/\u221a21=2\u221a21/7.\n\nSubstitute y into point D's equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + (2\u221a21/7 +\u221a21)^2=25 \u21d2x\u00b2 + ( (2\u221a21 +7\u221a21)/7 )\u00b2=25 \u21d2x\u00b2 + (9\u221a21/7)^2=25 \u21d2x\u00b2 + (81*21)/49=25 \u21d2x\u00b2 + 34.714=25 \u21d2x\u00b2\u2248-9.714 impossible.\n\nThus, no solution.\n\nHmm. This approach also fails.\n\nPerhaps the trapezoid is not symmetric about the y-axis?\n\nLet me try asymmetric coordinates.\n\nLet me let AB be from A(-2,0) to B(2,0). Let D be (d_x, h), and C be (c_x, h), so that CD is parallel to AB.\n\nThe trapezoid is isosceles, so the legs AD and BC must be equal in length and symmetric.\n\nThus,\n\nLength AD squared: (d_x +2)^2 + h\u00b2,\n\nLength BC squared: (2 -c_x)^2 + h\u00b2.\n\nSet equal:\n\n(d_x +2)^2 = (2 -c_x)^2 \u21d2d_x +2= \u00b1(2 -c_x).\n\nCase1: d_x +2 =2 -c_x \u21d2d_x +c_x=0 \u21d2c_x= -d_x.\n\nThus CD length is c_x -d_x= -d_x -d_x= -2d_x.\n\nSince CD>AB=4 \u21d2| -2d_x | >4 \u21d2|d_x|>2.\n\nAlso, trapezoid is convex, so the points should be ordered A(-2,0), B(2,0), and the upper base CD between them?\n\nWait, coordinates would require CD on the same side.\n\nAssuming the trapezoid is convex and points are ordered A,B on lower base, D on left upper, C on right upper.\n\nThus, to have CD parallel to AB and above, then coordinates:\n\nD is left of C, so d_x <c_x.\n\nFrom case1, c_x =-d_x.\n\nThus CD length is c_x -d_x = -d_x -d_x =-2d_x.\n\nTo have CD>AB=4 \u21d2-2d_x>4 \u21d2d_x < -2.\n\nThus d_x is negative.\n\nCoordinates of D(d_x, h), C(-d_x, h).\n\nPoint E is on line CD beyond D away from C (since D is between E and C).\n\nLine CD is from C(-d_x, h) to D(d_x, h). Wait, no, if D is at d_x <0, then C is at -d_x which is positive.\n\nThus, the line CD goes from C (positive x) to D (negative x). To extend beyond D away from C is further negative x direction.\n\nThus, point E is located at (d_x -2, h).\n\nMidpoint M of AE: A(-2,0), E(d_x-2,h).\n\nCoordinates of M: ( (d_x-2 -2)/2, h/2 )= ( (d_x -4)/2, h/2 ).\n\nNow, all points A,B,C,D,M must lie on the circle of radius 5.\n\nLet me set the circle's center at (p,q).\n\nEquations:\n\nA(-2,0): (p+2)^2 +q\u00b2=25 ...(1)\n\nB(2,0): (p-2)^2 +q\u00b2=25 ...(2)\n\nSubtract (1)-(2):\n\n(p+2)^2 - (p-2)^2=8p=0 \u21d2p=0.\n\nThus center is (0,q).

Let the center be (p,q).\n\nThen,\n\nFor A: p\u00b2 +q\u00b2=25,\n\nFor B: (p-4)^2 + q\u00b2=25,\n\nSubtract: -8p +16=0 \u21d2p=2.\n\nThus center must be (2,q).\n\nProceeding with this,\n\nLet me denote the trapezoid's other points:\n\nLet me let D be (x,y), C be (4 + (4 -2x), y) to keep CD parallel to AB,\n\nWait, perhaps better to use coordinates with AB(0,0) to B(4,0), and D(x,y), C(4+x,y).\n\nWait, to make CD parallel to AB,\n\nCD must be horizontal, so C is (x + c, y), D is (x, y), so CD length c.\n\nSince it's isosceles, the legs AD and BC must be equal:\n\nAD\u00b2 =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nBC\u00b2= (4 - (x +c))\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nSet equal:\n\nx\u00b2 = (4 -x -c)^2 \u21d2x\u00b2 =16 -8(x +c) + (x +c)^2 \u21d20=16 -8(x +c) + (x\u00b2 + 2c x +c\u00b2) -x\u00b2,\n\n0=16 -8x -8c +2c x +c\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n2c x -8x + (-8c) + (16 +c\u00b2)=0,\n\nFactor x:\n\nx(2c -8) + (-8c +16 +c\u00b2)=0,\n\nSolve for x:\n\nx= [8c -16 -c\u00b2]/ (2c -8).\n\nThis is complex.\n\nAlternatively, set CD length as CD= c>4,\n\nCD must be parallel to AB (horizontal),\n\nThus, C and D have the same y-coordinate.\n\nLet me let D be (a,b), so CD is from (a,b) to (a +c, b),\n\nThus,\n\nPoint C is (a +c, b).\n\nThe legs are AD and BC,\n\nAD squared: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2,\n\nBC squared: (4 - (a +c))\u00b2 +b\u00b2,\n\nSet equal:\n\na\u00b2 = (4 -a -c)^2 \u21d2a\u00b2 = (4 -a -c)^2 \u21d2a=4 -a -c \u21d22a +c=4,\n\nThus,\n\nc=4-2a,\n\nSince CD length is c>4 \u21d24-2a>4 \u21d2-2a>0 \u21d2a<0.\n\nThus, D is at (a,b) with a<0.\n\nPoint E is on line CD beyond D away from C,\n\nThus, E is at (a -2, b).\n\nMidpoint M of AE is midpoint of A(0,0) and E(a -2, b):\n\nM_x=(a-2)/2,\n\nM_y= b/2.\n\nAll points must lie on the circle centered at (2,q):\n\nEquations:\n\nA(0,0):4 + q\u00b2=25 \u21d2q\u00b2=21 \u21d2q=\u00b1\u221a21,\n\nD(a,b):\n\n(a-2)^2 + (b -q)^2=25,\n\nC(a +c, b)= (a +4-2a, b)= (4 -a, b):\n\n(4 -a -2)^2 + (b -q)^2= (2 -a)^2 + (b -q)^2=25,\n\nThus,\n\n(2 -a)^2 = (a-2)^2 \u21d2 same as D's equation. OK.\n\nE(a-2, b):\n\n(a-2 -2)^2 + (b -q)^2= (a-4)^2 + (b -q)^2=25,\n\nThus,\n\n(a-4)^2 + (b -q)^2=25,\n\nSubtract D's equation:\n\n(a-4)^2 - (a-2)^2= (a\u00b2-8a+16) - (a\u00b2-4a+4)= (-4a +12)=0 \u21d2-4a+12=0 \u21d2a=3,\n\nBut a must be <0, so contradiction.\n\nThus, no solution.\n\nThus, the problem is impossible. The answer might be \\boxed{2} as the only number related to DE=2, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the problem's constraints and my repeated attempts, I think the answer is likely \\boxed{2}\uff0c but I'm unsure.\n\nWait, another idea: Use coordinates with AB as diameter of the circle.\n\nAB is 4 units, so the circle with diameter AB would have radius 2, but the problem states 5, so no.\n\nAlternatively, place A and B on the circle, and find coordinates accordingly.\n\nLet me try to set the circle with center at (2, q), radius 5.\n\nPoints A(0,0) and B(4,0) are on it:\n\n0\u00b2 +0\u00b2 -4*2 +0*q +... Wait, equation is (x-2)^2 + (y -q)^2=25.\n\nFor A: (0-2)^2 + (0 -q)^2=4 + q\u00b2=25 \u21d2q\u00b2=21.\n\nLet me choose q=\u221a21.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of D(x,y).\n\nSince it's an isosceles trapezoid, D and C must be symmetric over x=2.\n\nThus, coordinates of C are (4 -x,y).\n\nCD length is (4 -x -x)=4-2x>4 \u21d2-2x>0 \u21d2x<0,\n\nThus D is left of the center.\n\nPoint E is on line CD beyond D away from C, so E is (x -2,y).\n\nMidpoint M of AE: between A(0,0) and E(x-2,y):\n\nM_x=(x-2)/2,\n\nM_y=y/2.\n\nThis M must be on the circle,\n\nThus,\n\n( (x-2)/2 -2 )\u00b2 + (y/2 -\u221a21)^2 =25,\n\nExpand:\n\n(x-2/2 -2)= (x-6)/2,\n\nThus,\n\n(x-6)^2/4 + (y/2 -\u221a21)^2 =25,\n\nMultiply by4:\n\n(x-6)^2 + (y -2\u221a21)^2 =100,\n\nAlso, D(x,y) is on the circle:\n\n(x-2)^2 + (y -\u221a21)^2=25,\n\nExpand both equations:\n\nD's equation:\n\nx\u00b2 -4x +4 + y\u00b2 -2y\u221a21 +21=25 \u21d2x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -4x -2y\u221a21 +25=25 \u21d2x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -4x -2y\u221a21=0 ...(1)\n\nM's equation:\n\n(x-6)^2 + (y -2\u221a21)^2=100,\n\nExpand:\n\nx\u00b2 -12x +36 + y\u00b2 -4y\u221a21 +84=100,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -12x -4y\u221a21 +120=100 \u21d2x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -12x -4y\u221a21= -20 ...(2)\n\nSubtract (1) from (2):\n\n(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -12x -4y\u221a21) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -4x -2y\u221a21 )= -8x -2y\u221a21 =-20 \u21d2\n\n8x +2y\u221a21=20 \u21d24x +y\u221a21=10 \u21d2y\u221a21=10-4x \u21d2y=(10-4x)/\u221a21 ...(3)\n\nPlug into (1):\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -4x -2y\u221a21=0,\n\nSubstitute y:\n\nx\u00b2 + [(10-4x)^2]/21 -4x -2*(10-4x)=0,\n\nExpand:\n\nx\u00b2 + (100 -80x +16x\u00b2)/21 -4x -20 +8x=0,\n\nCombine terms:\n\nMultiply all by21:\n\n21x\u00b2 +100 -80x +16x\u00b2 -84x -420 +168x=0,\n\n(21x\u00b2 +16x\u00b2) + (-80x -84x +168x) + (100 -420)=0,\n\n37x\u00b2 +4x -320=0,\n\nSolve:\n\nx=(-4\u00b1\u221a(16 +4*37*320))/74,\n\nDiscriminant:\n\n16 +4*37*320=16+47360=47376,\n\n\u221a47376=217.65,\n\nThus,\n\nx=(-4+217.65)/74\u2248213.65/74\u22482.89,\n\nor x=(-4-217.65)/74\u2248-221.65/74\u2248-2.995,\n\nSince x must be <0,\n\nx\u2248-2.995,\n\nThus,\n\ny=(10-4*(-2.995))/\u221a21\u2248(10+11.98)/4.583\u224821.98/4.583\u22484.797,\n\nThus,\n\nPoint D is at (-3,4.8),\n\nPoint E is at (-3-2,4.8)=(-5,4.8),\n\nMidpoint M is at (-5/2,2.4),\n\nDistance MD is between D(-3,4.8) and M(-2.5,2.4),\n\n\u0394x=0.5,\n\n\u0394y=-2.4,\n\nDistance squared=0.25+5.76=6.01 \u21d2MD\u22482.45,\n\nBut this is approximate.\n\nBut the problem likely has an exact answer.\n\nThus, let's compute precisely:\n\nEquation 37x\u00b2 +4x -320=0,\n\nSolution:\n\nx=(-4 \u00b1\u221a(16+47360))/74,\n\n\u221a47376=217.6506,\n\nThus,\n\nx1=(-4+217.6506)/74\u2248213.6506/74\u22482.887,\n\nx2=(-4-217.6506)/74\u2248-221.6506/74\u2248-2.995,\n\nTaking x\u2248-3,\n\nPlug into y=(10-4x)/\u221a21\u2248(10+12)/\u221a21\u224822/\u221a21,\n\nThus,\n\ny=22/\u221a21,\n\nCoordinates M:\n\nx=(x-2)/2\u2248(-3-2)/2\u2248-2.5,\n\ny= (22/\u221a21)/2=11/\u221a21,\n\nThus MD distance:\n\n\u0394x= -3 - (-2.5)= -0.5,\n\n\u0394y=22/\u221a21 -11/\u221a21=11/\u221a21,\n\nThus,\n\nMD squared=0.25 + (121)/21,\n\n= (0.525 +5.7619)=6.286,\n\nMD\u22482.5,\n\nBut not exact.\n\nWait, compute exactly:\n\nLet me let x=- (something).\n\nLet me denote x=-s where s>0,\n\nThen equation:\n\n37x\u00b2 +4x -320=0,\n\n37s\u00b2 -4s -320=0,\n\nSolution:\n\ns=(4 +\u221a(16+4*37*320))/74,\n\n\u221a(47376)=217.65,\n\nThus,\n\ns",
