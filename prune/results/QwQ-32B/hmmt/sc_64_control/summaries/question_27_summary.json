      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem where point P is inside triangle ABC. The conditions given are that angles ABP and ACP are equal, and the sides AB=6, AC=8, BC=7. Also, the ratio of BP to PC is 1/2. The goal is to find the ratio of the areas [BPC]/[ABC]. Hmm, let me think how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with areas and ratios in triangles, sometimes using mass point geometry, coordinate geometry, or trigonometric methods can be helpful. Since angles ABP and ACP are equal, maybe there's a way to use the Angle Bisector Theorem or some trigonometric identities?\n\nWait, the Angle Bisector Theorem relates the sides of a triangle to the segments created by the bisector. But here, the angles at B and C are related but not necessarily bisectors. Maybe I need to set up some equations using the Law of Sines or Cosines?\n\nAlternatively, since the ratio BP/PC = 1/2, perhaps I can use Ceva's Theorem? Ceva's Theorem states that for concurrent cevians, the product of the ratios is 1. But to use that, I think the cevians need to be concurrent. Let me recall Ceva's formula:\n\nIn triangle ABC, if three cevians AP, BP, CP meet the opposite sides at points D, E, F, then (BD/DC)*(CE/EA)*(AF/FB)=1. But here, maybe the angles given can help relate some sides?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using trigonometric Ceva's theorem? Since we have angles equal, that might be applicable. Let me recall that trigonometric Ceva's theorem states that if concurrent cevians make angles with the sides, then:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\sin \\angle ABP}{\\sin \\angle CBP} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin \\angle BCP}{\\sin \\angle ACP} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin \\angle CAP}{\\sin \\angle BAP} = 1\n\\]\n\nWait, but in our case, angle ABP is equal to angle ACP. Let me see. Let me denote angle ABP = angle ACP = \u03b8. Hmm, maybe I can set up variables for other angles and use trigonometric Ceva?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider coordinates. Maybe placing triangle ABC in coordinate plane and setting coordinates for point P such that BP/PC = 1/2, then using the angle condition to find coordinates of P?\n\nLet me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0), point B at (6,0), but wait, but AC is 8. Hmm, maybe better to place point A at (0,0), point B at (0,0) but need to consider the coordinates properly. Wait, perhaps better to place point A at (0,0), point B at (c,0), point C somewhere in the plane. Wait, but given the sides AB=6, AC=8, BC=7, so coordinates might be manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use the Law of Cosines to find coordinates. Let me first compute the coordinates of points B and C. Let me set point A at (0,0). Let me let AB be along the x-axis. So point B is at (6,0). Then point C is somewhere in the plane. The distance from A to C is 8, and from B to C is 7. So coordinates of C can be found.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of C as (x,y). Then:\n\nDistance from A(0,0) to C(x,y) is 8, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 64.\n\nDistance from B(6,0) to C(x,y) is 7, so (x-6)^2 + y^2 = 49.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x -6)^2 + y^2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 49 - 64 => (x\u00b2 -12x +36) -x\u00b2 = -15 => -12x +36 = -15 => -12x = -51 => x = 51/12 = 17/4 = 4.25\n\nSo x = 17/4. Then y\u00b2 = 64 - (17/4)^2 = 64 - 289/16 = (1024 - 289)/16 = 735/16. So y = sqrt(735)/4. Let me compute sqrt(735). Hmm, 735 factors into 49*15, so sqrt(49*15)=7*sqrt(15). Therefore, y = 7*sqrt(15)/4. So coordinates of C are (17/4, (7\u221a15)/4). Okay, so coordinates:\n\nA: (0,0)\n\nB: (6,0)\n\nC: (17/4, 7\u221a15/4)\n\nNow, point P is inside triangle ABC such that angle ABP = angle ACP. Also, BP/PC = 1/2. Need to find the area ratio [BPC]/[ABC].\n\nHmm, since BP/PC =1/2, that seems to relate the distances from P to B and to C. Maybe we can parametrize point P along the line segment BC? Wait, but BP/PC =1/2, so P divides BC in the ratio BP:PC=1:2. Wait, but that would mean P is on BC? But the problem states that P is inside the triangle. However, if P is on BC, then angle ABP and angle ACP would be angles at B and C, but angle ABP would be angle between BA and BP, and angle ACP would be angle between CA and CP, but if P is on BC, then angle ACP might be a different angle. Wait, perhaps the problem doesn't specify that P is on BC, so the ratio BP/PC=1/2 is not necessarily along BC? Wait, hold on, BP and PC are lengths, so the ratio is BP to PC along the line? Or in the triangle?\n\nWait, the problem says BP/PC =1/2, so that is the ratio of the lengths BP and PC. So point P is somewhere inside the triangle such that the distance from B to P over distance from P to C is 1/2. So BP = (1/2) PC. So BP : PC = 1 : 2. Therefore, if I consider point P lying along the line from B to C, then it would divide BC in the ratio 1:2. But in that case, P would be on BC. But the problem says \"inside triangle ABC\", so perhaps that is allowed? Because if you go from B to C, then the point 1/3 from B would be inside. Wait, but then the angles ABP and ACP would need to be equal. Hmm, but if P is on BC, then angle ACP is the same as angle ACB, and angle ABP is the angle at B between AB and BP. These two angles don't have to be equal unless specific conditions are met. So maybe P is not on BC? Hmm, so perhaps the ratio BP/PC is along some other line?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize point P such that BP/PC =1/2. Let me think in terms of coordinates. Let me denote coordinates of P as (x,y). Then BP distance is sqrt( (x-6)^2 + y^2 ), PC distance is sqrt( (x - 17/4)^2 + (y - 7\u221a15/4)^2 ). The ratio BP/PC =1/2. Therefore,\n\nsqrt( (x-6)^2 + y^2 ) / sqrt( (x - 17/4)^2 + (y - 7\u221a15/4)^2 ) = 1/2.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n[ (x-6)^2 + y^2 ] / [ (x - 17/4)^2 + (y - 7\u221a15/4)^2 ] = 1/4\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n4[(x-6)^2 + y^2] = (x - 17/4)^2 + (y - 7\u221a15/4)^2.\n\nThis gives an equation of the locus of points P such that BP/PC =1/2. So that's a circle called the Apollonius circle.\n\nAdditionally, we have the angle condition angle ABP = angle ACP. Let me think how to translate that into equations.\n\nFirst, angle ABP is the angle at point B between BA and BP. Similarly, angle ACP is the angle at point C between CA and CP. So we need the measure of those two angles to be equal.\n\nHmm, angles in coordinates can be tricky. Maybe using vectors or slopes?\n\nAlternatively, using trigonometric identities. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangles ABP and ACP?\n\nWait, angle ABP = angle ACP = \u03b8.\n\nIn triangle ABP, angle at B is \u03b8, side AB is 6, BP is some length.\n\nIn triangle ACP, angle at C is \u03b8, side AC is 8, CP is some length.\n\nWait, but how do these relate? Maybe using the Law of Sines in both triangles?\n\nIn triangle ABP:\n\nAB / sin(angle APB) = BP / sin(angle BAP)\n\nWait, but angle at B is angle ABP = \u03b8, angle at A is angle BAP, angle at P is angle APB.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle ACP:\n\nAC / sin(angle APC) = CP / sin(angle CAP)\n\nHmm, but this might not directly relate unless we have more information.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the Law of Sines in triangles ABP and ACP.\n\nWait, angle at B for triangle ABP is \u03b8, angle at C for triangle ACP is \u03b8.\n\nWait, perhaps considering triangle BPC? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using coordinates again. Let me try to set up equations for the angles.\n\nThe angle ABP is equal to angle ACP. Let me compute the slopes or vectors involved.\n\nFirst, vector BA is from B to A: from (6,0) to (0,0), so vector (-6, 0).\n\nVector BP is from B(6,0) to P(x,y): (x-6, y - 0) = (x-6, y).\n\nSimilarly, angle ACP: at point C between vectors CA and CP.\n\nVector CA is from C to A: ( -17/4, -7\u221a15/4 )\n\nVector CP is from C to P: (x -17/4, y -7\u221a15/4 )\n\nThe angle between vectors BP and BA at point B must equal the angle between vectors CP and CA at point C.\n\nSince angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product:\n\ncos(theta) = (v \u22c5 w) / (|v| |w| )\n\nTherefore, the angle between BA and BP at B is equal to the angle between CA and CP at C. So,\n\n[ BA \u22c5 BP ] / ( |BA| |BP| ) = [ CA \u22c5 CP ] / ( |CA| |CP| )\n\nLet me compute each side.\n\nFirst, BA vector is (-6, 0), BP vector is (x-6, y)\n\nDot product BA \u22c5 BP = (-6)(x -6) + 0*y = -6(x -6)\n\n|BA| = 6, |BP| = sqrt( (x-6)^2 + y^2 )\n\nSo left side is [ -6(x -6) ] / [6 * sqrt( (x-6)^2 + y^2 ) ] = [ - (x -6) ] / sqrt( (x -6)^2 + y^2 )\n\nSimilarly, for the right side:\n\nCA vector is from C to A: A - C = (-17/4, -7\u221a15/4 )\n\nCP vector is from C to P: P - C = (x -17/4, y -7\u221a15/4 )\n\nDot product CA \u22c5 CP = (-17/4)(x -17/4) + (-7\u221a15/4)(y -7\u221a15/4 )\n\nLet me compute that term by term:\n\nFirst term: (-17/4)(x -17/4) = (-17/4)x + (17/4)^2\n\nSecond term: (-7\u221a15/4)(y -7\u221a15/4 ) = (-7\u221a15/4)y + (7\u221a15/4)(7\u221a15/4 ) = (-7\u221a15/4)y + (49*15)/16\n\nTherefore, total dot product:\n\n(-17/4 x + (289/16)) + (-7\u221a15/4 y + 735/16 ) = (-17/4 x -7\u221a15/4 y ) + (289 + 735)/16\n\n289 + 735 is 1024, so 1024/16 = 64. So:\n\nDot product CA \u22c5 CP = - (17/4 x +7\u221a15/4 y ) + 64\n\nThe magnitude |CA| is 8 (given AC=8), and |CP| is sqrt( (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2 )\n\nTherefore, the right side is [ - (17/4 x +7\u221a15/4 y ) +64 ] / [ 8 * sqrt( (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2 ) ]\n\nSetting left side equal to right side:\n\n[ - (x -6) ] / sqrt( (x -6)^2 + y^2 ) = [ - (17/4 x +7\u221a15/4 y ) +64 ] / [ 8 * sqrt( (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2 ) ]\n\nHmm, this looks quite complicated. Maybe cross-multiplying?\n\nLet me denote sqrt terms as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote BP\u2019s denominator as D1 = sqrt( (x-6)^2 + y^2 )\n\nCP\u2019s denominator as D2 = sqrt( (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2 )\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\n- (x -6)/D1 = [ - (17/4 x +7\u221a15/4 y ) +64 ] / (8 D2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by D1 * 8 D2:\n\n-8 D2 (x -6) = D1 [ - (17/4 x +7\u221a15/4 y ) +64 ]\n\nThis seems very messy, but perhaps there's a way to combine this with the earlier equation from the BP/PC ratio?\n\nEarlier, from BP/PC =1/2, we had:\n\n4[(x-6)^2 + y^2] = (x - 17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2\n\nLet me expand that equation:\n\nLeft side: 4(x\u00b2 -12x +36 + y\u00b2 )\n\nWait, (x-6)^2 = x\u00b2 -12x +36, so 4*(x\u00b2 -12x +36 + y\u00b2 ) = 4x\u00b2 -48x +144 +4y\u00b2\n\nRight side: (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2\n\nExpand:\n\n(x\u00b2 - (17/2)x + (289/16)) + (y\u00b2 - (7\u221a15/2)y + (49*15)/16 )\n\nSo x\u00b2 - (17/2)x + 289/16 + y\u00b2 - (7\u221a15/2)y + 735/16\n\nCombine terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (17/2)x - (7\u221a15/2)y + (289 + 735)/16\n\nAgain, 289 +735 =1024, so 1024/16=64. So right side is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (17/2)x - (7\u221a15/2)y +64\n\nSet equal to left side:\n\n4x\u00b2 -48x +144 +4y\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (17/2)x - (7\u221a15/2)y +64\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n4x\u00b2 -48x +144 +4y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 + (17/2)x + (7\u221a15/2)y -64 =0\n\nSimplify:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 3y\u00b2 - (48 -17/2)x + (7\u221a15/2)y + (144 -64) =0\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\n48 is 96/2, so 48 -17/2 = (96 -17)/2 =79/2, so coefficient for x is -79/2 x\n\nSimilarly, 144-64=80\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 3y\u00b2 - (79/2)x + (7\u221a15/2)y +80 =0\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic equation. Maybe we can simplify by dividing by 3?\n\nAlternatively, leave it as is.\n\nSo that's one equation from BP/PC ratio.\n\nNow we also have the angle condition leading to the other equation above, which is very complex. This might lead to a system of equations that's difficult to solve by hand. Maybe there's a smarter approach.\n\nAlternative Idea: Using mass point or barycentric coordinates?\n\nSince BP/PC =1/2, so if we consider point P such that along BC, but earlier thought that might not satisfy angle condition. Wait, but maybe using mass point with the given angle condition?\n\nAlternatively, use Ceva's Theorem with trigonometric form.\n\nLet me try Trigonometric Ceva's Theorem.\n\nIn triangle ABC, if three cevians from A, B, C meet at a common point P, then:\n\n[sin(\u2220ABP)/sin(\u2220CBP)] * [sin(\u2220BCP)/sin(\u2220ACP)] * [sin(\u2220CAP)/sin(\u2220BAP)] =1\n\nBut in our case, we know that angle ABP = angle ACP = \u03b8.\n\nLet me denote angle ABP = angle ACP = \u03b8.\n\nLet me see if I can define other angles in terms of \u03b8.\n\nLet me denote angle CBP as \u03b1, so angle at B: angle ABC is split into angle ABP = \u03b8 and angle CBP = \u03b1. So angle at B is \u03b8 + \u03b1.\n\nSimilarly, at point C, angle ACP = \u03b8, and angle BCP = ?\n\nWait, angle at C: angle ACB is split into angle ACP = \u03b8 and angle BCP = \u03b2, so angle ACB = \u03b8 + \u03b2.\n\nAlso, at point A, the cevians from A would split angle BAC into some angles. Let me denote angle BAP = \u03b3 and angle CAP = \u03b4. So angle BAC = \u03b3 + \u03b4.\n\nBut since P is the intersection point of cevians AP, BP, CP, so need to relate all these angles.\n\nBut maybe with the given BP/PC ratio. Wait, BP/PC =1/2. So from point P, the ratio along BC? Wait, but BP/PC is not along BC unless P is on BC. Hmm, perhaps using the ratio in terms of areas?\n\nAlternatively, using the ratio BP/PC as a length, so in terms of mass point, we can assign masses at B and C such that mass at B is 2 and mass at C is1, so the mass at P would be 3. Then the mass at A would need to be determined via the other condition?\n\nAlternatively, mass point might not directly help with the angle condition.\n\nWait, let me think again with the trigonometric Ceva:\n\n[sin\u03b8 / sin \u03b1] * [sin \u03b2 / sin\u03b8] * [sin \u03b4 / sin \u03b3 ] =1\n\nBecause angle ACP =\u03b8, so angle BCP is \u03b2, so the second term is sin(\u03b2)/sin(\u03b8). The third term is [sin(angle CAP)/sin(angle BAP)] which is [sin \u03b4 / sin \u03b3 ]\n\nThus, Ceva's condition becomes:\n\n( sin\u03b8 / sin\u03b1 ) * ( sin\u03b2 / sin\u03b8 ) * ( sin\u03b4 / singamma ) =1 \u21d2 ( sin\u03b2 / sin\u03b1 )*( sin\u03b4 / singamma )=1\n\nHmm, but I need more relations. Also, angles in triangle ABC:\n\nAngle at A: \u03b3 + \u03b4\n\nAngle at B: \u03b8 + \u03b1\n\nAngle at C: \u03b8 + \u03b2\n\nSum of angles: (\u03b3 + \u03b4) + (\u03b8 + \u03b1) + (\u03b8 + \u03b2) = \u03c0\n\nSo 2\u03b8 + \u03b3 + delta + alpha + beta = \u03c0\n\nBut not sure if helpful yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps applying the Law of Sines in triangles ABP and ACP.\n\nIn triangle ABP:\n\nAB / sin(angle APB) = BP / sin(angle BAP) = AP / sin(angle ABP)\n\nSimilarly, in triangle ACP:\n\nAC / sin(angle APC) = CP / sin(angle CAP) = AP / sin(angle ACP)\n\nSince angle ABP = angle ACP =\u03b8, perhaps equate AP terms?\n\nLet me see.\n\nFrom triangle ABP:\n\nAP / sin\u03b8 = AB / sin(angle APB )\n\nFrom triangle ACP:\n\nAP / sin\u03b8 = AC / sin(angle APC )\n\nTherefore,\n\nAB / sin(angle APB ) = AC / sin(angle APC )\n\nSo,\n\nsin(angle APC)/sin(angle APB ) = AC/AB =8/6=4/3\n\nHmm, angle APC and APB are related? Since they are angles at P in different triangles. Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, since angle APB + angle APC + angle at P in other parts? Not straightforward.\n\nHmm, this might not be the right path. Maybe back to coordinate geometry.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) 3x\u00b2 + 3y\u00b2 - (79/2)x + (7\u221a15/2)y +80 =0 (from BP/PC ratio)\n\n2) The angle equality equation derived earlier, which is very complicated. Maybe instead of dealing with the angles directly, use the fact that the direction vectors need to satisfy some relation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that P lies somewhere along a certain line and parametrize accordingly?\n\nAlternatively, use barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC.\n\nIn barycentric coordinates, any point P can be expressed as (u, v, w) where u + v + w =1, corresponding to weights at A,B,C.\n\nBut I need to recall how barycentric coordinates work with ratios and angles.\n\nAlternatively, given BP/PC =1/2, so in terms of mass points, masses at B and C would be 2 and1, so the mass at P is 3, but how does that relate to the angle condition?\n\nAlternatively, express coordinates of P in terms of masses.\n\nWait, in barycentric coordinates, if P divides BC in ratio BP:PC=1:2, then coordinates would be (0, 2/3, 1/3), but that's only if P is on BC. But since P is inside the triangle and the angle condition may not hold there, so perhaps not on BC. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, set up variables for barycentric coordinates.\n\nLet me try barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC.\n\nLet coordinates of P be (u, v, w), so u + v + w =1.\n\nThen BP/PC =1/2. Wait, but BP and PC are lengths. Hmm, in barycentric coordinates, the distances are a bit more complex. Alternatively, in terms of mass points, the masses at B and C would be proportional to PC and BP. Since BP/PC=1/2, so mass at B is 2, mass at C is1, so mass at P is 3. Therefore, in barycentric coordinates, the coordinates of P would be (mass at A, mass at B, mass at C) but normalized. Wait, maybe mass point coordinates aren't directly barycentric.\n\nAlternatively, use the area ratios.\n\nWait, the problem is to find [BPC]/[ABC]. If I can find coordinates of P, then I can compute the areas.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the equations again.\n\nFirst equation from BP/PC ratio:\n\n3x\u00b2 + 3y\u00b2 - (79/2)x + (7\u221a15/2)y +80 =0 \u2192 Let me write this as:\n\nMultiply all terms by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n6x\u00b2 +6y\u00b2 -79x +7\u221a15 y +160 =0 \u2192 Equation (1)\n\nSecond equation from angle equality. The angle condition equation was:\n\n- (x -6)/D1 = [ - (17/4 x +7\u221a15/4 y ) +64 ] / (8 D2 )\n\nWhere D1 = sqrt( (x-6)^2 + y^2 )\n\nD2 = sqrt( (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2 )\n\nThis is very complicated, but perhaps if I square both sides to eliminate the square roots? Although that would lead to even more complexity, but maybe manageable.\n\nLet me denote LHS = - (x -6)/D1\n\nRHS = [ - (17/4 x +7\u221a15/4 y ) +64 ] / (8 D2 )\n\nThen equation is LHS = RHS \u2192 (LHS)^2 = (RHS)^2\n\nSo:\n\n[(x -6)^2]/D1\u00b2 = [ ( - (17/4 x +7\u221a15/4 y ) +64 )^2 ] / (64 D2\u00b2 )\n\nMultiply both sides by 64 D1\u00b2 D2\u00b2:\n\n64 (x-6)^2 D2\u00b2 = [ - (17/4 x +7\u221a15/4 y ) +64 ]^2 D1\u00b2\n\nBut D1\u00b2 = (x-6)^2 + y\u00b2\n\nD2\u00b2 = (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2\n\nThis seems too complicated. Maybe plugging in coordinates from equation (1) into this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that point P lies somewhere along a specific line?\n\nAlternatively, let me think numerically. Let me see if I can find coordinates that satisfy both equations. Let me suppose that point P is along the median or something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle condition implies that AP is the symmedian? Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, angle ABP = angle ACP. Maybe reflecting point over some line?\n\nAlternatively, consider triangle ABC and point P such that P is such that the angles at B and C are equal with respect to AP? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates with the given data.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider using mass point geometry with the given ratio BP/PC =1/2. If I can find the mass at A such that the cevians balance?\n\nWait, mass point assigns masses to vertices so that the masses are inversely proportional to the lengths. Since BP/PC =1/2, masses at B and C would be 2 and1 respectively. So mass at P is 3. Then, to make the angles equal, the masses at A should be such that the cevians from A, B, C meet at P. But I need to relate this to the angle condition.\n\nAlternatively, the angle condition might imply that the cevians from B and C are isogonal? Since angle ABP = angle ACP, maybe they are isogonal conjugates. Isogonal conjugates reflect over the angle bisectors. Hmm, perhaps too advanced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem can be solved using the concept of Ceva and areas.\n\nWait, since we need [BPC]/[ABC], maybe express areas in terms of BP and PC?\n\nWait, the area of BPC can be related to the areas of other triangles. Alternatively, using the ratio BP/PC=1/2, so if I let BP =k, PC=2k, then BC = BP + PC? Wait no, because P is inside the triangle, not on BC. Hmm, so BC is 7, but BP and PC are edges from P to B and C, so triangle BPC has sides BP, PC, and BC? Wait no, BC is the side opposite to A, so in triangle BPC, the sides are BP, PC, and BC? Wait, no. Wait, triangle BPC has vertices B, P, C. So sides are BP, PC, and BC. Wait, but BC is the side of the original triangle, so the length BC is 7. So in triangle BPC, the sides are BP, PC, and 7. But BP/PC =1/2, so BP = (1/2) PC. Let me denote PC =2x, BP=x. Then, in triangle BPC, sides are x, 2x, and 7. So by triangle inequality, x + 2x >7 \u2192 3x>7 \u2192x>7/3\u22482.333, and 2x +7 >x \u2192 x +7>0, which is okay, and x +7>2x \u21927> x. So x is between 7/3 and7.\n\nBut how does that help? Maybe use the Law of Cosines on triangle BPC?\n\nLet me denote angle at P between BP and PC as \u03c6. Then:\n\nBC\u00b2 = BP\u00b2 + PC\u00b2 - 2 BP PC cos\u03c6 \u2192 7\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + (2x)^2 -2*x*(2x)*cos\u03c6 \u2192 49 =5x\u00b2 -4x\u00b2 cos\u03c6 \u2192 49 =x\u00b2(5 -4 cos\u03c6)\n\nBut angle at B in triangle BPC is angle PBC, and angle at C is angle PCB. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in the original triangle ABC, with coordinates known, maybe compute coordinates of P that satisfy both equations.\n\nGiven that coordinates of C are (17/4,7\u221a15/4 ), coordinates of B(6,0), A(0,0).\n\nLet me try to see if there is a smarter way.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s consider the coordinates approach again. Let me note that equation (1) is from BP/PC ratio, which gives a circle equation. The angle condition is another equation. The intersection of these two equations would give coordinates of P. Since this is complicated, maybe plugging in variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume that the coordinates of P can be expressed in terms of parameters. Let me suppose that P lies along the angle bisector or something?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider using vectors.\n\nLet me denote vectors with origin at A(0,0). So vector AB is (6,0), vector AC is (17/4, 7\u221a15/4 ).\n\nLet me denote point P as a vector p = (x,y).\n\nGiven BP/PC =1/2, so the distance from B to P over distance from P to C is 1/2. So |p - b| / |p - c| =1/2, where b is vector B (6,0), c is vector C (17/4,7\u221a15/4).\n\nAdditionally, angle between vectors AB and BP equals angle between vectors AC and CP.\n\nVector AB is from A to B: (6,0). Vector BP is p - b.\n\nVector AC is from A to C: (17/4, 7\u221a15/4 ). Vector CP is p - c.\n\nThe angle between AB and BP equals angle between AC and CP.\n\nThe cosine of these angles must be equal.\n\nSo,\n\n[ AB \u00b7 BP / (|AB||BP|) ] = [ AC \u00b7 CP / (|AC||CP|) ]\n\nWhich is similar to the equation I had before. Let me write this equation again.\n\nAB \u00b7 BP = (6,0)\u00b7(x -6, y) =6(x-6) +0*y=6(x -6)\n\n|AB|=6, |BP|=sqrt( (x-6)^2 + y\u00b2 )\n\nAC \u00b7 CP = (17/4, 7\u221a15/4 )\u00b7(x -17/4, y -7\u221a15/4 )\n\nCompute this:\n\n17/4*(x -17/4) + (7\u221a15/4)(y -7\u221a15/4 )\n\n= (17x/4 - (17)^2/(16) ) + (7\u221a15 y)/4 - (7\u221a15)^2/(16)\n\n= 17x/4 - 289/16 + (7\u221a15 y)/4 - (49*15)/16\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n( -289 -735 ) /16 = -1024/16= -64, so:\n\nAC \u00b7 CP = (17x/4 +7\u221a15 y/4 ) -64\n\n|AC|=8, |CP|=sqrt( (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2 )\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n[6(x-6)/ (6 |BP| ) ] = [ (17x/4 +7\u221a15 y/4 -64 ) / (8 |CP| ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominators:\n\nLeft side: (x-6)/ |BP|\n\nRight side: [ (17x +7\u221a15 y -256)/4 ] / (8 |CP| )\n\nWait, let me recompute:\n\nWait the AC \u00b7 CP was (17x/4 + (7\u221a15)y/4 ) -64. So factor 1/4:\n\n(17x +7\u221a15 y - 256)/4. Since 64*4=256. So yes.\n\nTherefore, right side numerator is (17x +7\u221a15 y -256)/4, divided by 8 |CP| \u2192 [ (17x +7\u221a15 y -256)/32 |CP| ]\n\nWait, 4*8=32? Wait, no:\n\nWait, 8 |CP| is the denominator from |AC||CP|. Wait, the equation is:\n\n[ AC \u00b7 CP ] / (|AC| |CP| ) = [ (17x/4 +7\u221a15 y/4 -64 ) ] / (8 |CP| )\n\nWait, actually, the equation is:\n\n[AB \u00b7 BP / (|AB| |BP| ) ] = [ AC \u00b7 CP / (|AC| |CP| ) ]\n\nSo,\n\n[6(x-6)/ (6 |BP| )] = [ ( (17x +7\u221a15 y -256)/4 ) / (8 |CP| ) ]\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, AC \u00b7 CP = (17x +7\u221a15 y -256)/4, and |AC|=8, so the right side is:\n\n[ (17x +7\u221a15 y -256)/4 ] / (8 |CP| )\n\nWhich simplifies to (17x +7\u221a15 y -256)/(32 |CP| )\n\nSo equation is:\n\n(x -6)/ |BP| = (17x +7\u221a15 y -256)/(32 |CP| )\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n32 |CP| (x -6) = |BP| (17x +7\u221a15 y -256 )\n\nBut |BP| and |CP| are sqrt terms from earlier.\n\nHmm, but we also have from BP/PC =1/2, which gives |BP| = (1/2)|CP|. So |CP| = 2|BP|.\n\nTherefore, substituting |CP| =2|BP| into above equation:\n\n32*(2|BP|)*(x -6) = |BP|*(17x +7\u221a15 y -256 )\n\nCancel |BP| from both sides (assuming |BP|\u22600, which is true as P is inside the triangle):\n\n64(x -6) =17x +7\u221a15 y -256\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n64x -384 -17x -7\u221a15 y +256 =0 \u2192 (64x -17x) + (-7\u221a15 y) + (-384 +256)=0 \u219247x -7\u221a15 y -128=0\n\nSo we have 47x -7\u221a15 y =128 \u2192 equation (2)\n\nNow, we have equation (1):\n\n6x\u00b2 +6y\u00b2 -79x +7\u221a15 y +160 =0\n\nAnd equation (2):\n\n47x -7\u221a15 y =128 \u2192 can solve for y in terms of x.\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\n-7\u221a15 y =128 -47x \u2192 y = (47x -128)/(7\u221a15 )\n\nNow plug this into equation (1).\n\nFirst, compute y = (47x -128)/(7\u221a15 )\n\nLet me denote numerator as N =47x -128, denominator D=7\u221a15, so y = N/D.\n\nPlugging into equation (1):\n\n6x\u00b2 +6*(N/D)^2 -79x +7\u221a15*(N/D) +160 =0\n\nMultiply all terms by D\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n6x\u00b2 D\u00b2 +6N\u00b2 -79x D\u00b2 +7\u221a15 N D +160 D\u00b2 =0\n\nThis is getting complicated, but let me compute term by term.\n\nFirst, D =7\u221a15, so D\u00b2=49*15=735\n\nCompute each term:\n\n1) 6x\u00b2 *735 = 4410x\u00b2\n\n2) 6*(N)^2 / D\u00b2 * D\u00b2 =6N\u00b2\n\nWait, actually, when multiplied by D\u00b2:\n\n6*(N/D)^2 * D\u00b2 =6N\u00b2\n\n3) -79x * D\u00b2 = -79x *735 = -79*735 x\n\n4) 7\u221a15 *N/D * D\u00b2 =7\u221a15 *N*D =7\u221a15*(47x-128)*(7\u221a15 )\n\n5) 160 * D\u00b2 =160*735\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nTerm1: 6x\u00b2 *735 = 4410x\u00b2\n\nTerm2:6N\u00b2 =6*(47x -128)^2\n\nTerm3: -79 *735 x = -79*735 x \u2192 compute 79*700=55300, 79*35=2765 \u2192 total 55300+2765=58065 \u2192 so -58065x\n\nTerm4:7\u221a15*(47x-128)*7\u221a15 =7*7*(\u221a15)^2*(47x-128) =49*15*(47x -128)= 735*(47x -128)\n\nTerm5:160*735 =160*700 +160*35=112000 +5600=117600\n\nNow, putting all together:\n\n4410x\u00b2 +6*(47x -128)^2 -58065x +735*(47x -128) +117600 =0\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst expand 6*(47x -128)^2:\n\nFirst compute (47x -128)^2 = (47x)^2 -2*47x*128 +128^2 =2209x\u00b2 -12288x +16384\n\nMultiply by6:6*2209x\u00b2=13254x\u00b2; 6*(-12288x)= -73728x; 6*16384=98304\n\nSo term2 becomes:13254x\u00b2 -73728x +98304\n\nTerm4:735*(47x -128)=735*47x -735*128\n\n735*47: 700*47=32900; 35*47=1645 \u2192 total=32900+1645=34545; so first part 34545x\n\n735*128: 700*128=89600, 35*128=4480 \u2192 total 89600+4480=94080 \u2192 so term4 is 34545x -94080\n\nNow, putting all terms:\n\nTerm1:4410x\u00b2\n\nTerm2:13254x\u00b2 -73728x +98304\n\nTerm3: -58065x\n\nTerm4:34545x -94080\n\nTerm5:+117600\n\nCombine all terms:\n\nx\u00b2 terms:\n\n4410 +13254 =17664x\u00b2\n\nx terms:\n\n-73728x -58065x +34545x \u2192 (-73728 -58065 +34545)x = (-73728 -58065 is -131,793 +34545 \u2192 -131,793 +34,545 = -97,248 \u2192 so -97248x )\n\nConstant terms:\n\n98304 -94080 +117600 = (98304 -94080)=4224 +117600= 121,824\n\nThus entire equation is:\n\n17664x\u00b2 -97248x +121,824 =0\n\nDivide all terms by 48 to simplify?\n\nLet me see:\n\n17664 /48 = 17664 \u00f7 48: 48*368=17664 \u2192 368\n\n97248 /48: 97248 \u00f748: 48*2025= 97,200; 48*2025 +48= 97,248 \u2192 2025 +1=2026?

Let me see: 303\u00b2=91,809; 304\u00b2=92,416 \u2192 between 303 and 304. Not a perfect square. Hmm, so maybe made a miscalculation somewhere?\n\nLet me double-check the previous steps because this is getting too messy.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding terms. Let me retrace:\n\nWhen expanding 735*(47x -128):\n\n735*47x: 47x *700=32,900x; 47x*35=1,645x \u2192 total 34,545x. Then 735*128= 94,080. So term4 is 34545x -94,080. That seems correct.\n\nTerm2:6*(47x-128)^2: expanded as 6*(2209x\u00b2 - 12288x +16384)=13254x\u00b2 -73,728x +98,304. Correct.\n\nTerm3: -58,065x.

Trying to divide further, perhaps by 2?\n\nYes, 368/2=184, 2026/2=1013, 2538/2=1269. So 184x\u00b2 -1013x +1269=0.\n\nHmm, perhaps this factors?\n\nLooking for factors of 184*1269 that add to -1013. Not sure. Maybe use quadratic formula.\n\nx = [1013 \u00b1 sqrt(1013\u00b2 -4*184*1269)]/(2*184)\n\nWe had D=92,185.\n\nsqrt(92,185) \u2248303.62 (since 303\u00b2=91,809, 304\u00b2=92,416). So approximate value:\n\nsqrt(92185)= approx 303.62.\n\nThus,\n\nx\u2248 [1013 \u00b1303.62]/368\n\nCompute both roots:\n\nFirst root: (1013 +303.62)/368 \u22481316.62/368\u22483.578\n\nSecond root: (1013 -303.62)/368\u2248709.38/368\u22481.928\n\nSo possible x\u22483.578 or x\u22481.928.\n\nNow let's compute corresponding y from equation (2):47x -7\u221a15 y =128 \u2192 y=(47x -128)/(7\u221a15)\n\nFirst, for x\u22483.578:\n\ny\u2248(47*(3.578) -128)/(7*3.87298) [since \u221a15\u22483.87298]\n\n47*3.578\u224847*3.5=164.5 +47*0.078\u2248164.5+3.666\u2248168.166\n\n168.166 -128=40.166\n\nDenominator:7*3.87298\u224827.1109\n\nThus y\u224840.166/27.1109\u22481.481\n\nSo coordinates (3.578,1.481)\n\nSecond root x\u22481.928:\n\ny=(47*1.928 -128)/(7\u221a15)\n\n47*1.928\u224847*2=94 minus 47*0.072\u224894 -3.384\u224890.616\n\n90.616 -128\u2248-37.384\n\nDivide by same denominator\u224827.1109 \u2192 y\u2248-37.384/27.1109\u2248-1.379\n\nBut point P is inside the triangle. Coordinates of triangle ABC are A(0,0), B(6,0), C(4.25, 4.807). The y-coordinate of C is 7\u221a15/4 \u22487*3.87298/4\u224827.1109/4\u22486.7777? Wait wait, hold on:\n\nWait earlier computed coordinates of C as (17/4,7\u221a15/4). 17/4 is 4.25, and 7\u221a15/4 is approximately (7*3.87298)/4\u224827.1109/4\u22486.7777.\n\nSo, the triangle has vertices at (0,0), (6,0), (4.25, ~6.7777). Therefore, the y-coordinate of any interior point must be between 0 and ~6.77. The second root has y\u2248-1.379, which is below the triangle, so discard. Thus the valid solution is first root x\u22483.578, y\u22481.481.\n\nSo approximate coordinates of P are (3.578,1.481). Now need to compute [BPC]/[ABC].\n\nFirst compute area of ABC. Using coordinates:\n\nCoordinates:\n\nA(0,0); B(6,0); C(4.25,6.7777).\n\nArea of ABC is (base * height)/2. Alternatively, using shoelace formula:\n\nArea = \u00bd | (0*(0 -6.7777) +6*(6.7777 -0) +4.25*(0 -0) ) | =\u00bd |0 +6*6.7777 +0| =\u00bd*(40.6662)=20.3331\n\nAlternatively exact value:\n\nThe area can be computed via Heron's formula. Given sides AB=6, AC=8, BC=7.\n\ns=(6+8+7)/2=21/2=10.5\n\nArea=\u221a[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)]=\u221a[10.5*(10.5-6)(10.5-8)(10.5-7)]=\u221a[10.5*4.5*2.5*3.5]\n\nCalculate this:\n\n10.5=21/2, 4.5=9/2, 2.5=5/2, 3.5=7/2\n\nMultiply all: (21/2)(9/2)(5/2)(7/2)= (21*9*5*7)/(2^4)= (21*9=189; 189*5=945; 945*7=6615) numerator; denominator 16\n\nSo area=\u221a(6615/16)= (\u221a6615)/4. Let me compute \u221a6615.\n\nFactor 6615: divide by 5: 1323. 1323 divided by 3:441. 441=21\u00b2. So 6615=5\u00d73\u00d721\u00b2= 3\u00d75\u00d721\u00b2. Thus sqrt(6615)=21\u00d7sqrt(15). So area=21\u221a15/4.\n\nTherefore, [ABC]=21\u221a15/4\u224821*3.87298/4\u224881.3326/4\u224820.333, which matches the approximate value.\n\nNow compute area of BPC. Using coordinates of B(6,0), P(3.578,1.481), C(4.25,6.7777)\n\nUse shoelace formula:\n\nCoordinates:\n\nB(6,0); P(3.578,1.481); C(4.25,6.7777)\n\nCompute area:\n\n\u00bd | (6*(1.481 -6.7777) +3.578*(6.7777 -0) +4.25*(0 -1.481) ) |\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nFirst term:6*(1.481 -6.7777)=6*(-5.2967)= -31.780\n\nSecond term:3.578*(6.7777)=3.578*6=21.468 +3.578*0.7777\u224821.468 +2.783\u224824.251\n\nThird term:4.25*(-1.481)= -6.28225\n\nSum all terms:\n\n-31.780 +24.251 -6.28225\u2248-13.811\n\nTake absolute value and \u00bd: \u00bd*13.811\u22486.9055\n\nSo approximate area [BPC]\u22486.9055\n\nThus ratio [BPC]/[ABC]\u22486.9055/20.333\u22480.3397 or approx 1/3.\n\nHmm, but let's see if the exact value can be computed.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps compute exactly.\n\nFirst let's find exact coordinates of P by solving equations.\n\nWe had equation (2):47x -7\u221a15 y =128 \u2192 y=(47x -128)/(7\u221a15 )\n\nEquation (1):6x\u00b2 +6y\u00b2 -79x +7\u221a15 y +160 =0\n\nLet me plug y=(47x\u2212128)/(7\u221a15 ) into equation (1):\n\n6x\u00b2 +6*( (47x\u2212128)^2 )/(7\u221a15)^2 -79x +7\u221a15*( (47x\u2212128)/(7\u221a15 )) +160=0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term:6x\u00b2\n\nSecond term:6*(47x-128)^2/(49*15)=6/(735)*(47x-128)^2 = (2/245)*(47x-128)^2\n\nThird term:-79x\n\nFourth term:7\u221a15*(47x-128)/(7\u221a15)= (47x-128)\n\nFifth term:+160\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n6x\u00b2 + (2/245)(47x -128)^2 -79x + (47x -128) +160 =0\n\nCompute 47x -128 +160=47x +32\n\nThus,\n\n6x\u00b2 + (2/245)(47x -128)^2 -79x +47x +32 =0 \u21926x\u00b2 + (2/245)(47x -128)^2 -32x +32=0\n\nLet me compute (47x -128)^2:\n\n= (47x)^2 -2*47x*128 +128^2 =2209x\u00b2 -12288x +16384\n\nMultiply by 2/245:\n\n(2/245)(2209x\u00b2 -12288x +16384 )= (4418x\u00b2 -24576x +32768)/245\n\nThus equation:\n\n6x\u00b2 + (4418x\u00b2 -24576x +32768)/245 -32x +32 =0\n\nMultiply all terms by 245 to eliminate denominators:\n\n6x\u00b2*245 +4418x\u00b2 -24576x +32768 -32x*245 +32*245 =0\n\nCompute each term:\n\n6x\u00b2*245=1470x\u00b2\n\n4418x\u00b2 remains\n\n-24576x remains\n\n32768 remains\n\n-32x*245= -32*245 x= -7840x\n\n32*245=7840\n\nNow combine all terms:\n\n(1470x\u00b2 +4418x\u00b2) + (-24576x -7840x) + (32768 +7840)=0\n\nCompute:\n\n1470+4418=5888x\u00b2\n\n-24576-7840= -32416x\n\n32768+7840=40608\n\nThus equation is:\n\n5888x\u00b2 -32416x +40608 =0\n\nDivide all terms by 16 to simplify:\n\n5888/16=368; 32416/16=2026; 40608/16=2538 \u2192 back to previous equation: 368x\u00b2 -2026x +2538=0\n\nThus no help.

Perhaps my approximate angle calculations introduced errors.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute using the Law of Sines in triangle BPC:\n\nArea BPC= (1/2)*BP*PC*sin(angle BPC)=0.5*BP*PC*0.966\n\nWith BP=2.84, PC=5.70, so 0.5*2.84*5.70=0.5*16.188=8.094, then *0.966\u22487.82.\n\nBut area ABC is 21\u221a15/4\u224821*3.87298/4\u224881.33/4\u224820.33.\n\nThus ratio\u22487.82/20.33\u22480.385, which is approx 38.5%.\n\nHmm, but this is different from coordinate calculation of ~0.34. Hmm, likely due to approximation errors in angle \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the more accurate coordinates.\n\nEarlier, with x\u22483.578 and y\u22481.481, the area ratio was ~0.34.\n\nBut this discrepancy suggests that maybe the exact value is a simple fraction.\n\nWait, let me think of mass point geometry.\n\nGiven BP/PC=1/2, so mass at B is 2, C is1, so the mass at P is3. The mass at A is unknown.\n\nThe angles ABP=ACP.\n\nIn mass point, the cevians must balance the masses. The angle condition might imply something about the mass at A.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of Ceva with masses.\n\nThe Ceva condition in mass point requires (mass_A/mass_B)*(mass_B/mass_C)*(mass_C/mass_A)=1, but with angles it's different.\n\nAlternatively, since the angles are equal, perhaps the cevians are isogonal, so masses must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the areas.\n\nLet me denote the areas:\n\nLet [BPC]=x, [ABP]=y, [APC]=z.\n\nWe have y +x +z = [ABC].\n\nAlso, from the ratio BP/PC=1/2, in triangle BPC, the area [BPC] is divided by AP into [BPC] = [BPA] + [CPA]? No, AP is another cevian.\n\nAlternatively, using the ratio of areas related to the cevians.\n\nThe ratio of areas involving the same height.\n\nThe areas [ABP] and [APC] can be related to the ratio of BP to PC if they share a common height.\n\nWait, no, they don't share the same base or height.\n\nAlternatively, since AP is a common side, but angles at B and C are equal.\n\nWait, the areas [ABP] and [ACP] have the following relationship:\n\n[BPC] = [ABC] - [ABP] - [APC]\n\nWe also have from earlier the ratio of areas [ABP]/[APC]= (AB * BP sin\u03b8)/(AC * CP sin\u03b8)= (AB/BP)/(AC/CP)= (6/BP)/(8/CP)= (6/(8))*(CP/BP)= (6/8)*2= 3/4\n\nThus [ABP]/[APC]= 3/4 \u2192 [ABP]= (3/4)[APC]\n\nLet me denote [APC]=4k, so [ABP]=3k.\n\nThen total area [ABC]=3k +4k + [BPC] =7k +x= [ABC]\n\nThus x= [ABC] -7k.\n\nWe need to find x/[ABC]= ( [ABC] -7k )/[ABC]=1 -7k/[ABC]\n\nThus need to find k/[ABC]\n\nFrom [ABP]=3k and [ABP]= (1/2)*AB*BP*sin\u03b8= 3k \u2192 (1/2)*6*BP*sin\u03b8=3k \u21923 BP sin\u03b8=3k \u2192 BP sin\u03b8=k\n\nSimilarly, [APC]=4k= (1/2)*AC*CP*sin\u03b8= (1/2)*8*CP*sin\u03b8 \u21924 CP sin\u03b8=4k \u2192CP sin\u03b8=k\n\nThus from BP sin\u03b8=CP sin\u03b8=k \u2192 BP=CP*(BP sin\u03b8)/(CP sin\u03b8)= same k cancels? Wait,\n\nWait from BP sin\u03b8=k and CP sin\u03b8=k \u2192 BP=CP*(k)/(sin\u03b8*k/sin\u03b8)? Hmm, no, actually:\n\nBP sin\u03b8= CP sin\u03b8 \u2192 BP=CP. But this contradicts BP/CP=1/2.\n\nWait, no: Wait, BP sin\u03b8=k and CP sin\u03b8=k \u2192 BP=CP. But given BP/CP=1/2 \u2192 BP= (1/2)CP \u2192 then (1/2 CP)*sin\u03b8=k and CP sin\u03b8=k \u2192 (1/2 CP)*sin\u03b8 = (CP sin\u03b8)/2= k \u2192 yes, so k= (CP sin\u03b8)/2, and k= BP sin\u03b8.\n\nThus consistent.\n\nTherefore, we can relate [APC]=4k=4*(BP sin\u03b8)=4*( (1/2 CP) sin\u03b8)=2 CP sin\u03b8.\n\nBut CP sin\u03b8= k \u2192 [APC]=2k*2=4k, yes.\n\nThus, the key is to find k/[ABC].\n\nFrom [ABP]=3k and [ABC]=7k +x.\n\nBut we need another relation between k and [ABC].\n\nAlternatively, the Law of Sines in triangles ABP and ACP gives ratios involving angles at A.\n\nIn triangle ABP:\n\nAP/sin(angle ABP)= BP/sin(angle BAP)\n\nIn triangle APC:\n\nAP/sin(angle ACP)= CP/sin(angle CAP)\n\nBut angle ABP=angle ACP=\u03b8,\n\nAnd angle BAP + angle CAP= angle BAC= \u03b1.\n\nLet me denote angle BAP=\u03b3, angle CAP=\u03b4, so \u03b3 +\u03b4= \u03b1.\n\nFrom the two equations above,\n\nAP/sin\u03b8 = BP/sin\u03b3 \u2192 AP= BP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b3\n\nAP= CP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b4 \u2192 thus BP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b3= CP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b4 \u2192 BP/sin\u03b3=CP/sin\u03b4 \u2192 BP/CP= sin\u03b3/sin\u03b4 \u2192 but BP/CP=1/2,\n\nThus,\n\nsin\u03b3/sin\u03b4=1/2 \u2192 sin\u03b3=(1/2) sin\u03b4\n\nAlso, \u03b3 +\u03b4= \u03b1= angle BAC=57.91\u00b0.\n\nLet me use these two equations:\n\nsin\u03b3=0.5 sin\u03b4,\n\n\u03b3 +\u03b4= \u03b1.\n\nLet me set \u03b3= \u03b1 -\u03b4,\n\nThus,\n\nsin(\u03b1 -\u03b4)=0.5 sin\u03b4\n\nExpand sin(\u03b1 -\u03b4)= sin\u03b1 cos\u03b4 -cos\u03b1 sin\u03b4,\n\nThus,\n\nsin\u03b1 cos\u03b4 -cos\u03b1 sin\u03b4=0.5 sin\u03b4,\n\nRearranged,\n\nsin\u03b1 cos\u03b4= (cos\u03b1 sin\u03b4 +0.5 sin\u03b4)= sin\u03b4 (cos\u03b1 +0.5 )\n\nThus,\n\nsin\u03b1 cos\u03b4 = sin\u03b4 (cos\u03b1 +0.5 )\n\nDivide both sides by sin\u03b4,\n\nsin\u03b1 cot\u03b4= cos\u03b1 +0.5\n\nThus,\n\ncot\u03b4= (cos\u03b1 +0.5)/sin\u03b1\n\nCompute numerically with \u03b1=57.91\u00b0:\n\nsin\u03b1\u22480.8480,\n\ncos\u03b1\u22480.5299,\n\nThus,\n\ncot\u03b4=(0.5299 +0.5)/0.8480\u2248(1.0299)/0.8480\u22481.2143 \u2192 tan\u03b4\u22480.823 \u2192\u03b4\u224839.4\u00b0,\n\nThus \u03b4\u224839.4\u00b0, \u03b3=57.91-39.4\u224818.5\u00b0,\n\nWhich matches previous approximate values.\n\nThus, now, in triangle ABP,\n\nAP= BP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b3,\n\nIn triangle APC,\n\nAP= CP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b4.\n\nThus,\n\nBP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b3= CP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b4 \u2192 BP/CP= sin\u03b3/sin\u03b4=0.5 (from earlier),\n\nWhich is consistent.\n\nNow, using Law of Sines in triangles ABP and ABC.\n\nIn triangle ABC,\n\nAB/sin(angle ACB)= AC/sin(angle ABC)= BC/sin(angle BAC)\n\nWe can compute AP using coordinates or via other means.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle ABP,\n\nAP/sin\u03b8= BP/sin\u03b3 \u2192 AP= BP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b3,\n\nSimilarly, in triangle APC,\n\nAP= CP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b4,\n\nThus, equate:\n\nBP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b3 = CP sin\u03b8/sin\u03b4 \u2192 BP/CP= sin\u03b3/sin\u03b4=0.5 (as before)\n\nNow, to find k= BP sin\u03b8,\n\nWe can relate this to the sides.\n\nLet me denote BP= x, so CP=2x.\n\nThus, from Law of Sines in triangle BPC,\n\nBP/sin(angle BCP)= PC/sin(angle PBC)= BC/sin(angle BPC)\n\nangle BCP= angle ACB -\u03b8=\u03b3_C -\u03b8,\n\nangle PBC= angle ABC -\u03b8=\u03b2_B -\u03b8,\n\nangle BPC= 180\u00b0 -

No, mass points are typically for concurrent cevians.\n\nAlternatively, using the masses, the cevians must satisfy the angle condition.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of areas can be related to the masses.\n\nWait, the area ratio [BPC]/[ABC] can be the mass at A divided by total mass?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, the mass at A is such that the cevians are isogonal, so masses must be in proportion to the sides.\n\nAlternatively, since angle ABP=angle ACP,\n\nThe cevians BP and CP are isogonal conjugates, so the masses must satisfy certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio can be found via the formula involving the given ratio BP/PC and the sides AB and AC.\n\nLet me consider using the formula from the following theorem:\n\nIf in triangle ABC, a point P inside satisfies angle ABP=angle ACP, and BP/PC=m/n, then the ratio [BPC]/[ABC] can be expressed in terms of m,n, AB, and AC.\n\nHowever, I don't recall a standard theorem for this, so perhaps need to derive it.\n\nLet me consider using barycentric coordinates.\n\nLet me set barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC.\n\nLet P have coordinates (u, v, w), so u+v+w=1.\n\nThe condition BP/PC=1/2 in terms of barycentric coordinates.\n\nIn barycentric coordinates, the distance ratios can be related to the weights.\n\nThe coordinates of P can be expressed in terms of the masses.\n\nSince BP/PC=1/2, the mass at B is 2, at C is1, so the mass at P is3, but the mass at A is m.\n\nThus, the coordinates of P are (m, 2,1)/ (m+3).\n\nThus,\n\nu=m/(m+3),\n\nv=2/(m+3),\n\nw=1/(m+3),\n\nNow, the angle condition angle ABP=angle ACP.\n\nTo express this in barycentric coordinates, we need to compute the angles.\n\nAlternatively, use the condition that the direction vectors of BP and CP make equal angles with BA and CA respectively.\n\nAlternatively, the direction vectors:\n\nVector BA is A - B = (-c,0) (assuming coordinates with B at origin).\n\nBut this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, use the trigonometric condition in barycentric coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, using the condition angle ABP=angle ACP,\n\nThis would relate to the slopes of BP and CP with respect to BA and CA.\n\nBut this requires converting barycentric coordinates to cartesian.\n\nAlternatively, let me use vector approach with barycentric coordinates.\n\nLet me denote vectors in barycentric coordinates where A is (1,0,0), B (0,1,0), C (0,0,1).\n\nThe coordinates of P are (u, v, w), u+v+w=1.\n\nThe vectors BA and BP can be represented as:\n\nBA = A - B = (1,-1,0),\n\nBP = P - B = (u, v-1, w).\n\nThe angle between BA and BP is equal to the angle between vectors AC and CP.\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-1,0,1),\n\nCP = P - C = (u, v, w-1).\n\nThe cosine of the angles between BA and BP, and between AC and CP must be equal.\n\nThe cosine of the angle between vectors BA and BP is:\n\n(BA \u00b7 BP)/( |BA| |BP| )\n\nSimilarly for the other vectors.\n\nCompute BA \u00b7 BP = (1)(u) + (-1)(v-1) +0*w = u -v +1.\n\n|BA|=\u221a(1^2 + (-1)^2 +0^2)=\u221a2,\n\n|BP|=\u221a(u\u00b2 + (v-1)^2 +w\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly, AC \u00b7 CP = (-1)u +0*v +1*(w-1)= -u +w -1,\n\n|AC|=\u221a( (-1)^2 +0^2 +1^2 )=\u221a2,\n\n|CP|=\u221a(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 + (w-1)^2 ).\n\nSetting the cosines equal:\n\n[ (u -v +1)/\u221a2 / sqrt(u\u00b2 + (v-1)^2 +w\u00b2) ) ] = [ (-u +w -1)/\u221a2 / sqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 + (w-1)^2 ) ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n(u -v +1)/sqrt(u\u00b2 + (v-1)^2 +w\u00b2) = (-u +w -1)/sqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 + (w-1)^2 )\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n(u -v +1)*sqrt(u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 + (w-1)^2 ) = (-u +w -1)*sqrt(u\u00b2 + (v-1)^2 +w\u00b2 )\n\nSquare both sides to eliminate sqrt:\n\n(u -v +1)^2 (u\u00b2 +v\u00b2 + (w-1)^2 ) = (-u +w -1)^2 (u\u00b2 + (v-1)^2 +w\u00b2 )\n\nThis equation is complicated, but with barycentric coordinates and the relation u+v+w=1, and masses.\n\nRecall that in barycentric coordinates with masses m,2,1:\n\nu=m/(m+3),\n\nv=2/(m+3),\n\nw=1/(m+3),\n\nThus, substituting:\n\nLet me set m as a variable and express everything in terms of m.\n\nLet me denote s=m+3,\n\nThus,\n\nu=m/s,\n\nv=2/s,\n\nw=1/s,\n\nWith u+v+w= (m+3)/s=1.\n\nNow, substituting into the equation:\n\n(u -v +1)= (m/s -2/s +1)= (m-2)/s +1= (m-2 +s)/s,\n\nBut s=m+3 \u2192 m-2+s= m-2 +m+3= 2m+1,\n\nThus,\n\n(u -v +1)= (2m+1)/s,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(-u +w -1)= (-m/s +1/s -1)= (-m+1)/s -1= (-m+1 -s)/s,\n\nAgain s=m+3,\n\n-m+1-s= -m+1 -m-3= -2m-2,\n\nThus,\n\n(-u +w -1)= (-2m-2)/s,\n\nNext, compute denominators:\n\nFirst sqrt term:\n\nu\u00b2 +v\u00b2 + (w-1)^2,\n\n= (m\u00b2/s\u00b2) + (4/s\u00b2) + ( (1/s -1)^2 )\n\n= (m\u00b2 +4)/s\u00b2 + ( (1 -s)/s )^2,\n\n= (m\u00b2 +4)/s\u00b2 + ( ( -

If BP:PC=1:2,\n\nThen coordinates of P are:\n\nx=(2*6 +1*(17/4))/(1+2)= (12 +17/4)/3= (48/4 +17/4)/3=65/12\u22485.4167,\n\ny=(2*0 +1*(7\u221a15/4))/3=7\u221a15/12\u2248(7*3.872)/12\u224827.11/12\u22482.26,\n\nCompute angles ABP and ACP:\n\nAt point B, angle ABP is the angle between BA and BP.\n\nVector BA is A to B: (6,0),\n\nVector BP is from B to P: (65/12 -6, 2.26 -0)= (65/12 -72/12)= (-7/12, 2.26).\n\nThe angle between BA (6,0) and BP (-7/12, 2.26).\n\nThe angle can be computed via dot product:\n\ncos\u03b8= (BA \u00b7 BP)/( |BA||BP| )\n\nBA \u00b7 BP=6*(-7/12)+0*2.26= -7/2,\n\n|BA|=6,\n\n|BP|=sqrt( ( -7/12)^2 + (2.26)^2 )\u2248sqrt(0.361 +5.1076)=sqrt(5.4686)=2.338,\n\nThus,\n\ncos\u03b8= (-3.5)/(6*2.338)= -3.5/14.028\u2248-0.249,\n\nThus angle ABP\u2248104\u00b0,\n\nSimilarly angle ACP at point C between CA and CP.\n\nVector CA is from C to A: (-17/4, -7\u221a15/4),\n\nVector CP is from C to P: (65/12 -17/4, 2.26 -7\u221a15/4),\n\nCompute coordinates:\n\n65/12 -17/4=65/12 -51/12=14/12=7/6\u22481.1667,\n\n2.26 - (7\u221a15)/4\u22482.26 - (7*3.872)/4\u22482.26 -6.777\u2248-4.517,\n\nThus vector CP\u2248(1.1667, -4.517),\n\nVector CA is (-4.25, -6.777).\n\nThe angle between CA and CP:\n\nDot product CA \u00b7 CP= (-4.25)(1.1667) + (-6.777)(-4.517)=\u2248-4.958 +30.63\u224825.67,\n\n|CA|=8,\n\n|CP|=sqrt( (1.1667)^2 + (-4.517)^2 )\u2248sqrt(1.36 +20.4)=sqrt(21.76)=4.665,\n\nThus,\n\ncos\u03c6=25.67/(8*4.665)\u224825.67/37.32\u22480.688,\n\nThus angle ACP\u224846.7\u00b0, which is not equal to angle ABP\u2248104\u00b0, so the angle condition isn't satisfied. Thus P is not on BC.\n\nTherefore, the correct ratio is approximately 0.34, which is 17/50 or 1/3, but given the problem's constraints, the exact value is likely a simple fraction.\n\nWait, let me compute the ratio with the approximate value of [BPC]\u22487.82 and [ABC]=21\u221a15/4\u224820.33,\n\nThus, 7.82/20.33\u22480.385,\n\nBut with the coordinate method, got ~0.34.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the exact value is 2/7,\n\nBut let me compute the approximate area with coordinates:\n\nP(3.578,1.481),\n\nArea BPC:\n\nUsing shoelace formula with B(6,0), P(3.578,1.481), C(4.25,6.7777):\n\nArea=1/2 |6*(1.481-6.7777)+3.578*(6.7777-0)+4.25*(0-1.481)|\n\nCompute term1:6*(-5.2967)= -31.78,\n\nterm2:3.578*6.7777\u224824.25,\n\nterm3:4.25*(-1.481)\u2248-6.282,\n\nTotal: -31.78+24.25-6.282\u2248-13.81,\n\nAbsolute value 13.81*0.5\u22486.905,\n\nThus ratio 6.905/20.33\u22480.34.\n\nThus approximately 0.34 is 17/50 or 34/100=17/50=0.34,\n\nSo answer is 17/50,\n\nBut need to see if this is exact.\n\nAlternatively, in equation:\n\nThe quadratic solution for x is,\n\nx = [2026 \u00b1\u221a(2026\u00b2 -4*368*2538)]/(2*368),\n\nBut the discriminant D=2026\u00b2 -4*368*2538,\n\nWait earlier computed D=2026\u00b2 -4*368*2538=4,104,676 -3,735,936=368,740,\n\nFactor 368,740:\n\nDivide by 4: 92,185,\n\nCheck if divisible by 5: yes, 92,185/5=18,437,\n\n18,437 is prime?

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have triangle ABC with AB=6, AC=8, and BC=7. There's a point P inside the triangle such that angle ABP equals angle ACP. Also, the ratio of BP to PC is 1:2. We need to find the ratio of the area of triangle BPC to the area of triangle ABC. Alright, let me start by drawing a rough sketch of triangle ABC. Let me label the points: A at the top, B and C at the base. Since AB is 6, AC is 8, and BC is 7, that's an scalene triangle. \n\nGiven that P is inside the triangle with angle ABP equal to angle ACP, and BP/PC = 1/2. Hmm, angle conditions can sometimes be tricky. Maybe I can use trigonometry here? Or perhaps some area ratios. Since we have a ratio of lengths BP/PC, maybe mass point geometry? Wait, but the angle condition complicates things. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Ceva's Theorem? Ceva's Theorem relates the ratios of segments created by cevians in a triangle when they are concurrent. But to use Ceva's, we need three cevians. Here, we have point P connected to B and C, but what about the third one? The angle condition might relate to another cevian?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in some triangles. Let me consider triangles ABP and ACP. Since angles at B and C are equal (angle ABP = angle ACP), maybe I can set up some sine relationships.\n\nLet me denote angle ABP = angle ACP = \u03b8. Let me also let BP = x, so PC = 2x, since their ratio is 1:2. Then, BC is 7, but BP + PC = BC? Wait, no. Wait, BP and PC are parts of BC? Wait, hold on. Wait, BP and PC are segments along BC? Or are they along different sides? Hmm, the problem says P is inside the triangle. The angles are angle ABP and angle ACP. So angle ABP is the angle at B between BA and BP, and angle ACP is the angle at C between CA and CP. So BP is a segment from B to P, and CP is from C to P. So BP and PC are not along BC. Wait, but BP/PC is given as 1/2. Wait, does that ratio refer to the lengths of BP and PC? So the length BP divided by length PC is 1/2. So BP = (1/2) PC, meaning PC = 2 BP. So if BP is x, PC is 2x, but they are not along the same line. Hmm, so the ratio is between the lengths of segments BP and PC, but they are in different directions. Hmm. That complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point A somewhere, maybe at (0,0), but then coordinates for B and C need to be set such that AB=6, AC=8, BC=7. Hmm, perhaps coordinate system approach. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set point A at (0,0). Let me place point B at (6,0), since AB=6. Wait, but then AC is 8, so point C would be somewhere such that the distance from A (0,0) to C is 8, and the distance from B (6,0) to C is 7. Let me find coordinates for point C.\n\nLet me suppose coordinates of C are (x,y). Then, distance from A to C is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 8, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 64.\n\nDistance from B (6,0) to C (x,y) is sqrt( (x-6)^2 + y\u00b2 ) = 7, so (x-6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 49.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x-6)^2 + y\u00b2] = 64 - 49 => x\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 -12x +36) = 15 => 12x -36 =15 => 12x = 51 => x = 51/12 = 17/4 = 4.25\n\nSo x = 17/4. Then, substitute back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =64:\n\n(17/4)^2 + y\u00b2 =64\n\n289/16 + y\u00b2 = 64\n\nMultiply all terms by 16:\n\n289 +16 y\u00b2 = 1024\n\n16 y\u00b2 = 1024-289 = 735\n\ny\u00b2=735/16 \u21d2 y= sqrt(735)/4. Let me compute sqrt(735). 735 factors: 49*15, so sqrt(49*15)=7*sqrt(15). Thus y=7\u221a15 /4. So coordinates of point C are (17/4, 7\u221a15/4). Hmm, okay. So coordinates:\n\nA(0,0), B(6,0), C(17/4, 7\u221a15/4). That's a bit messy, but maybe manageable.\n\nNow, we need to find point P inside triangle ABC such that angle ABP = angle ACP, and BP/PC =1/2. Let me denote coordinates for P as (p,q). Then, we need to set up equations based on the given conditions.\n\nFirst, the ratio BP/PC =1/2. Wait, but BP and PC are lengths, so BP / PC =1/2. So BP = (1/2) PC. So sqrt( (p-6)^2 + (q-0)^2 ) / sqrt( (p - 17/4)^2 + (q -7\u221a15/4)^2 ) = 1/2. That's one equation.\n\nSecond, angle ABP = angle ACP. Hmm, how to express that in coordinates? The angle between BA and BP at point B equals the angle between CA and CP at point C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using vectors? Or using the tangent of the angles?\n\nAlternatively, using the Law of Sines in triangles ABP and ACP?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me consider triangles involving those angles. Let me see.\n\nAt point B, angle ABP is the angle between BA and BP. BA is the vector from B to A, which is (-6,0). BP is the vector from B to P, which is (p-6, q). Similarly, at point C, angle ACP is the angle between CA and CP. CA is the vector from C to A, which is (-17/4, -7\u221a15/4). CP is the vector from C to P, which is (p - 17/4, q -7\u221a15/4). The angle between BA and BP at B equals the angle between CA and CP at C.\n\nTo find this angle equality, perhaps using the dot product formula? Since the cosine of the angle between two vectors u and v is (u \u00b7 v)/( |u| |v| ). So setting the cosines equal? Let me try that.\n\nFirst, for angle at B between BA and BP:\n\nVectors BA = A - B = (-6, 0). Vector BP = P - B = (p -6, q).\n\nThe cosine of angle ABP is (BA \u00b7 BP) / (|BA| |BP| )\n\nSimilarly, angle at C between CA and CP:\n\nVectors CA = A - C = (-17/4, -7\u221a15/4). Vector CP = P - C = (p -17/4, q -7\u221a15/4).\n\nThe cosine of angle ACP is (CA \u00b7 CP) / (|CA| |CP| )\n\nSetting these equal:\n\n[ (BA \u00b7 BP) / (|BA| |BP| ) ] = [ (CA \u00b7 CP) / (|CA| |CP| ) ]\n\nHmm, that's a complicated equation, but let's write it out.\n\nFirst, compute BA \u00b7 BP: (-6)(p -6) + 0*(q) = -6(p -6).\n\n|BA| is 6, since BA length is AB=6.\n\n|BP| is sqrt( (p -6)^2 + q\u00b2 )\n\nCA \u00b7 CP: (-17/4)(p -17/4) + (-7\u221a15/4)(q -7\u221a15/4 )\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term: (-17/4)(p -17/4) = (-17/4)p + (17/4)^2\n\nSecond term: (-7\u221a15/4)(q -7\u221a15/4 ) = (-7\u221a15/4) q + (7\u221a15/4)^2 * ?\n\nWait, expanding:\n\n-7\u221a15/4 * q + (7\u221a15/4)*(7\u221a15/4) ?\n\nWait, actually, (q -7\u221a15/4) multiplied by -7\u221a15/4:\n\n= -7\u221a15/4 * q + (7\u221a15/4)^2 ?\n\nWait, yes, because it's (-7\u221a15/4)*q + (7\u221a15/4)*(7\u221a15/4). Because the term is (-7\u221a15/4) multiplied by ( -7\u221a15/4 )? Wait no, the second term is (-7\u221a15/4) multiplied by (-7\u221a15/4). Wait, no:\n\nWait, let's redo:\n\nCA \u00b7 CP = (-17/4)(p - 17/4) + (-7\u221a15/4)(q - 7\u221a15/4)\n\n= (-17/4)p + (17/4)^2 + (-7\u221a15/4) q + (7\u221a15/4)^2\n\nWait, actually, the second term is:\n\n(-7\u221a15/4)(q) + (-7\u221a15/4)( -7\u221a15/4 )\n\nBecause the second term in CP is (q -7\u221a15/4), so distributing:\n\n= (-7\u221a15/4)*q + (-7\u221a15/4)*(-7\u221a15/4)\n\nSo, that gives the second part as (-7\u221a15/4) q + (49*15)/16 ?\n\nWait, yes. Let me compute (7\u221a15/4)^2: (7^2)*(\u221a15)^2 / 4^2 = 49*15 /16 = 735/16.\n\nWait, but with a negative times negative, so positive. So altogether:\n\nCA \u00b7 CP = [ - (17/4)p + (289/16) ] + [ - (7\u221a15/4) q + 735/16 ]\n\nSo combining constants:\n\n289/16 + 735/16 = (289 +735)/16 = 1024/16 = 64. Wait, 289+735: 289+700 is 989, plus 35 is 1024? Hmm, 289+735=1024? Let me check: 289 + 700 is 989, then +35 is 1024. Yes, because 735 is 700+35. So that's 64. Interesting.\n\nSo CA \u00b7 CP = - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15/4) q + 64.\n\nThe magnitude |CA| is AC = 8, since CA is the vector from C to A, so its length is AC=8.\n\n|CP| is sqrt( (p -17/4)^2 + (q -7\u221a15/4)^2 )\n\nPutting this all together into the cosine equality:\n\n[ (-6(p -6)) / (6 * |BP| ) ] = [ ( - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15/4) q + 64 ) / (8 * |CP| ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominators:\n\nLeft side: [ -6(p -6) ] / [6 |BP| ] = - (p -6)/ |BP|\n\nRight side: [ - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15/4) q + 64 ] / (8 |CP| )\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n- (p -6)/ |BP| = [ - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15/4) q + 64 ] / (8 |CP| )\n\nHmm, but this seems very complicated. Not sure if this is the best approach. Maybe coordinate geometry is getting too messy here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using mass point geometry? Since we have the ratio BP/PC =1/2. Wait, but mass point usually deals with ratios along sides, but here BP and PC are cevians from different vertices. Wait, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, using Ceva's theorem. Let me recall that Ceva's Theorem states that for concurrent cevians from A, B, C, the product of the ratios is 1. But in this case, do we have three cevians?\n\nWait, point P is inside the triangle, so the cevians would be AP, BP, and CP. But to apply Ceva, we need the ratios on each side. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the cevians are AP, BP, CP. Wait, but Ceva's Theorem requires the cevians to be from each vertex to the opposite side. So, for example, if AP meets BC at D, BP meets AC at E, and CP meets AB at F, then (BD/DC)(CE/EA)(AF/FB)=1. But here, the problem gives us angle conditions and a ratio involving BP and PC, but not along a side. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the trigonometric Ceva's theorem? Since we have angle conditions. Trigonometric Ceva states that if concurrent cevians make angles with the sides, then the product of the sine ratios equals 1. Wait, yes, that might be useful here.\n\nTrigonometric Ceva's Theorem: If three cevians AD, BE, CF are concurrent at P, then\n\n( sin\u2220BAD / sin\u2220CAD ) * ( sin\u2220CBE / sin\u2220ABE ) * ( sin\u2220ACF / sin\u2220BCF ) ) =1.\n\nHmm, not sure if directly applicable here, but let me see.\n\nIn our problem, we have angle ABP = angle ACP. Let me see if I can set up ratios with that.\n\nLet me denote angle ABP = angle ACP = \u03b8. Let me try to apply trigonometric Ceva. Let me consider the point P inside triangle ABC, with cevians AP, BP, CP. The angles given relate to angles at B and C. Let me see:\n\nAt vertex B, the cevian is BP. The angles at B are angle ABP and angle CBP. Similarly, at vertex C, the cevian is CP, so angles at C are angle ACP and angle BCP.\n\nWait, so angle ABP = \u03b8, angle CBP would be angle at B minus angle ABP. Let me denote angle ABC as \u03b2. Then angle CBP = \u03b2 - \u03b8. Similarly, angle ACP = \u03b8, angle BCP would be angle ACB - \u03b8. Let me denote angle ACB as \u03b3. Then angle BCP = \u03b3 - \u03b8.\n\nAlso, at vertex A, the cevian is AP. The angles at A would be angle BAP and angle CAP. Let me denote angle BAC as \u03b1. Then, angle BAP + angle CAP = \u03b1. But we don't have info about those.\n\nAccording to trigonometric Ceva:\n\n[ (sin(angle BAP)/sin(angle CAP)) ] * [ (sin(angle ABP)/sin(angle CBP)) ] * [ (sin(angle ACP)/sin(angle BCP)) ] ) = 1\n\nHmm, let's write that down:\n\n[sin(\u2220BAP)/sin(\u2220CAP)] * [sin(\u03b8)/sin(\u03b2 - \u03b8)] * [sin(\u03b8)/sin(\u03b3 - \u03b8)] =1\n\nHmm, but this introduces several variables (angles at A, angles at B and C which we can compute since we know the sides). Let me see if we can compute angles \u03b2 and \u03b3 using the given side lengths.\n\nGiven triangle ABC with AB=6, AC=8, BC=7. Let me compute angles at B and C using the Law of Cosines.\n\nFirst, angle at B (angle ABC):\n\ncos \u03b2 = (AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 - AC\u00b2)/(2*AB*BC)\n\nWait, Law of Cosines: for angle at B, opposite side is AC=8, so:\n\ncos \u03b2 = (AB\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 - AC\u00b2)/(2*AB*BC) = (6\u00b2 +7\u00b2 -8\u00b2)/(2*6*7) = (36 +49 -64)/84 = (21)/84 = 1/4.\n\nThus, angle \u03b2 has cosine 1/4, so sin \u03b2 = sqrt(1 - (1/4)^2) = sqrt(15/16) = \u221a15 /4.\n\nSimilarly, angle at C (angle ACB):\n\ncos \u03b3 = (AC\u00b2 + BC\u00b2 - AB\u00b2)/(2*AC*BC) = (8\u00b2 +7\u00b2 -6\u00b2)/(2*8*7) = (64 +49 -36)/112 = (77)/112 = 11/16.\n\nThus, cos \u03b3 = 11/16, so sin \u03b3 = sqrt(1 - (121/256)) = sqrt(135/256) = (3\u221a15)/16.\n\nHmm, okay. So we can write sin \u03b2 = \u221a15/4, sin \u03b3 = 3\u221a15/16.\n\nNow, going back to Ceva equation:\n\n[sin(\u2220BAP)/sin(\u2220CAP)] * [sin\u03b8 / sin(\u03b2 - \u03b8)] * [sin\u03b8 / sin(\u03b3 - \u03b8)] = 1\n\nBut we have another condition: BP/PC =1/2. Wait, BP and PC are lengths of cevians. How can we relate that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the ratio BP/PC and Stewart's theorem?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use mass point with the given ratio BP/PC =1/2. Wait, mass point assigns masses to vertices so that the masses are inversely proportional to lengths. But since BP/PC =1/2 along the cevian? Wait, but BP and PC are not along the same line. Wait, mass point might not directly apply here.\n\nAlternatively, consider areas. The question asks for [BPC]/[ABC]. Maybe we can express areas in terms of BP and PC and the sine of angles?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the areas using the sine formula. The area of triangle BPC is (1/2)*BP*CP*sin(angle between BP and CP). But angle between BP and CP at point P? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since angle ABP = angle ACP = \u03b8, perhaps set up equations using the Law of Sines in triangles ABP and ACP.\n\nIn triangle ABP: AB=6, BP is a side, angle at B is \u03b8. So, maybe:\n\nAP / sin(angle ABP) = BP / sin(angle BAP)\n\nSimilarly, in triangle ACP: AC=8, CP is a side, angle at C is \u03b8. So,\n\nAP / sin(angle ACP) = CP / sin(angle CAP)\n\nSince angle ABP = angle ACP = \u03b8, so sin(angle ABP)=sin(angle ACP).\n\nThus, from the two equations:\n\nAP / sin\u03b8 = BP / sin(angle BAP) ...(1)\n\nAP / sin\u03b8 = CP / sin(angle CAP) ...(2)\n\nTherefore, BP / sin(angle BAP) = CP / sin(angle CAP)\n\nSo BP / CP = [ sin(angle BAP) / sin(angle CAP) ]\n\nBut BP / CP = 1/2 (given BP/PC =1/2). Therefore,\n\n1/2 = [ sin(angle BAP) / sin(angle CAP) ]\n\nSo sin(angle BAP)/sin(angle CAP) = 1/2 ...(3)\n\nNow, going back to the trigonometric Ceva equation earlier:\n\n[sin(\u2220BAP)/sin(\u2220CAP)] * [sin\u03b8 / sin(\u03b2 - \u03b8)] * [sin\u03b8 / sin(\u03b3 - \u03b8)] = 1\n\nFrom equation (3), sin(angle BAP)/sin(angle CAP) =1/2. Substitute that in:\n\n(1/2) * [ sin\u03b8 / sin(\u03b2 - \u03b8) ] * [ sin\u03b8 / sin(\u03b3 - \u03b8) ] =1\n\nSo,\n\n[ sin\u00b2\u03b8 ] / [ 2 sin(\u03b2 - \u03b8) sin(\u03b3 - \u03b8) ] =1\n\nTherefore,\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b2 - \u03b8) sin(\u03b3 - \u03b8 )\n\nHmm, this is an equation in \u03b8. Let me see if I can solve this equation for \u03b8. Let me write down the known values of \u03b2 and \u03b3. Earlier computed:\n\n\u03b2: angle at B, with cos \u03b2 =1/4, so \u03b2 = arccos(1/4)\n\n\u03b3: angle at C, with cos \u03b3=11/16, so \u03b3 = arccos(11/16)\n\nHmm, perhaps we can use trigonometric identities to simplify the right-hand side.\n\nRecall that sin(A - B) sin(A + B) = sin\u00b2A - sin\u00b2B. Wait, but here we have sin(\u03b2 - \u03b8) sin(\u03b3 - \u03b8). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, expand sin(\u03b2 - \u03b8) sin(\u03b3 - \u03b8) using sine subtraction formulas.\n\nFirst, write sin(\u03b2 - \u03b8) = sin\u03b2 cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b2 sin\u03b8\n\nSimilarly, sin(\u03b3 - \u03b8) = sin\u03b3 cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b3 sin\u03b8\n\nMultiply them:\n\n[sin\u03b2 cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b2 sin\u03b8][sin\u03b3 cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b3 sin\u03b8]\n\n= sin\u03b2 sin\u03b3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u03b2 cos\u03b3 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - cos\u03b2 sin\u03b3 cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + cos\u03b2 cos\u03b3 sin\u00b2\u03b8\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote \u03c6 = \u03b8, then the equation becomes:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03c6 = 2 sin(\u03b2 - \u03c6) sin(\u03b3 - \u03c6)\n\nLet me see if I can plug in the known values of sin\u03b2, cos\u03b2, sin\u03b3, cos\u03b3.\n\nWe have:\n\nsin\u03b2 = \u221a15 /4\n\ncos\u03b2 =1/4\n\nsin\u03b3 = 3\u221a15 /16\n\ncos\u03b3 =11/16\n\nThus,\n\nsin(\u03b2 - \u03c6) = sin\u03b2 cos\u03c6 - cos\u03b2 sin\u03c6 = (\u221a15/4) cos\u03c6 - (1/4) sin\u03c6\n\nsin(\u03b3 - \u03c6) = sin\u03b3 cos\u03c6 - cos\u03b3 sin\u03c6 = (3\u221a15/16) cos\u03c6 - (11/16) sin\u03c6\n\nMultiply them:\n\n[ (\u221a15/4 cos\u03c6 - 1/4 sin\u03c6 ) * (3\u221a15/16 cos\u03c6 - 11/16 sin\u03c6) ]\n\nLet me compute this term by term:\n\nFirst term: \u221a15/4 * 3\u221a15/16 cos\u00b2\u03c6 = (3 *15)/ (4*16) cos\u00b2\u03c6 = (45)/64 cos\u00b2\u03c6\n\nSecond term: \u221a15/4 * (-11/16) cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6 = - (11\u221a15)/64 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6\n\nThird term: -1/4 sin\u03c6 * 3\u221a15/16 cos\u03c6 = - (3\u221a15)/64 sin\u03c6 cos\u03c6\n\nFourth term: -1/4 sin\u03c6 * (-11/16) sin\u03c6 = (11)/64 sin\u00b2\u03c6\n\nSo combining all terms:\n\n45/64 cos\u00b2\u03c6 - [11\u221a15/64 + 3\u221a15/64] cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6 + 11/64 sin\u00b2\u03c6\n\nSimplify coefficients:\n\nThe middle terms: - [ (14\u221a15)/64 ] cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6 = - (7\u221a15)/32 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6\n\nSo overall:\n\n45/64 cos\u00b2\u03c6 - (7\u221a15)/32 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6 + 11/64 sin\u00b2\u03c6\n\nTherefore, the right-hand side is 2 times this:\n\n2*[45/64 cos\u00b2\u03c6 - (7\u221a15)/32 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6 + 11/64 sin\u00b2\u03c6 ]\n\n= 45/32 cos\u00b2\u03c6 - (7\u221a15)/16 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6 + 11/32 sin\u00b2\u03c6\n\nThus, the equation is:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03c6 = 45/32 cos\u00b2\u03c6 - (7\u221a15)/16 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6 + 11/32 sin\u00b2\u03c6\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03c6 - 45/32 cos\u00b2\u03c6 + (7\u221a15)/16 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6 - 11/32 sin\u00b2\u03c6 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03c6 -11/32 sin\u00b2\u03c6 = (21/32) sin\u00b2\u03c6\n\n-45/32 cos\u00b2\u03c6 remains\n\nand + (7\u221a15)/16 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6\n\nThus:\n\n21/32 sin\u00b2\u03c6 -45/32 cos\u00b2\u03c6 + (7\u221a15)/16 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6 =0\n\nMultiply both sides by 32 to eliminate denominators:\n\n21 sin\u00b2\u03c6 -45 cos\u00b2\u03c6 +14\u221a15 cos\u03c6 sin\u03c6 =0\n\nHmm, this equation is still quite complex. Maybe express everything in terms of sin\u03c6 or cos\u03c6. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me divide both sides by cos\u00b2\u03c6 to convert to tan\u03c6 terms. Let me set t = tan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6. Then sin\u00b2\u03c6 = t\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03c6, and cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1/(1 + t\u00b2). Wait, but perhaps:\n\nLet me divide the entire equation by cos\u00b2\u03c6:\n\n21 (sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6) -45 +14\u221a15 (sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6) =0\n\nSo 21 t\u00b2 +14\u221a15 t -45 =0, where t = tan\u03c6.\n\nAh! That seems better. Let me check:\n\n21 (sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6) -45 +14\u221a15 (sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6) =0\n\nYes, so 21 t\u00b2 +14\u221a15 t -45 =0, where t = tan\u03c6.\n\nSo this quadratic equation can be solved for t.\n\nLet me write that:\n\n21 t\u00b2 +14\u221a15 t -45 =0\n\nLet me compute discriminant D = (14\u221a15)^2 -4*21*(-45)\n\nCompute D:\n\n(14)^2*(15) + 4*21*45\n\n14^2 is 196, so 196*15 = 2940\n\n4*21*45 = 4*945= 3780\n\nThus D =2940 +3780 = 6720\n\nWait, but discriminant is (14\u221a15)^2 -4*21*(-45)= 14\u00b2*15 +4*21*45 = yes, since it's (b\u00b2 -4ac) where a=21, b=14\u221a15, c=-45, so D = (14\u221a15)^2 -4*21*(-45) = 14\u00b2*15 +4*21*45. So yes, 2940 + 3780 = 6720\n\nThus sqrt(D) = sqrt(6720). Let me simplify sqrt(6720):\n\n6720 = 16 * 420 = 16*4*105 = 64*105 = 64*15*7. Thus sqrt(6720)=8*sqrt(105). Hmm, sqrt(105) can't be simplified further.\n\nThus,\n\nt = [ -14\u221a15 \u00b18\u221a105 ] / (2*21)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nFactor out 2: 2[ -7\u221a15 \u00b14\u221a105 ] / (42) = [ -7\u221a15 \u00b14\u221a105 ] /21\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me check the signs. Since \u03c6 is an angle inside the triangle, between 0 and angle B or C, so tan\u03c6 should be positive. Thus, we take the positive root:\n\nt = [ -14\u221a15 +8\u221a105 ] / (42) ?\n\nWait, let me recast:\n\nWait, the quadratic formula is t = [ -b \u00b1 sqrt(D) ]/(2a)\n\nHere, a=21, b=14\u221a15, so:\n\nt = [ -14\u221a15 \u00b1 sqrt(6720) ] / (42)\n\nsqrt(6720)=sqrt(16*420)=4*sqrt(420)=4*sqrt(4*105)=8*sqrt(105). So sqrt(D)=8\u221a105.\n\nTherefore,\n\nt = [ -14\u221a15 \u00b18\u221a105 ] /42\n\nFactor numerator:\n\nTake 2 common:\n\n2[ -7\u221a15 \u00b14\u221a105 ] /42 = [ -7\u221a15 \u00b14\u221a105 ] /21\n\nWe need the positive solution, so:\n\nt = [ -7\u221a15 +4\u221a105 ] /21 ?\n\nWait, but let me see if that is positive. Let me compute approximate values.\n\nCompute \u221a15\u22483.872, \u221a105\u224810.246\n\nThus,\n\n-7*3.872 \u2248-27.104\n\n4*10.246\u224840.984\n\nThus numerator: -27.104 +40.984 \u224813.88, so 13.88 /21\u22480.66. Positive.\n\nAlternatively, the other root:\n\n-7\u221a15 -4\u221a105 \u2248-27.104 -40.984\u2248-68.088, which is negative. So we take the first one.\n\nThus tan\u03c6 \u22480.66, but let's keep it symbolic.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a better way to handle this. Alternatively, perhaps there is a specific angle that satisfies this equation? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can proceed without explicitly solving for \u03b8.\n\nLet me recall that we need to find the area ratio [BPC]/[ABC].\n\nLet me think of the areas in terms of coordinates again, even though it's messy.\n\nAlternatively, use mass point with the ratio BP/PC =1, but not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: Let me use barycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC.\n\nIn barycentric coordinates, any point P can be expressed as (u, v, w) where u + v + w =1, and u, v, w correspond to weights at A, B, C.\n\nThe area ratios can be expressed in terms of these coordinates. Also, the condition BP/PC =1/2 might translate into a relation between v and w.\n\nWait, in barycentric coordinates, the coordinates (u, v, w) correspond to masses at A, B, C. The ratios of the areas are related to these masses. But the ratio BP/PC is a bit tricky. Wait, perhaps the mass point approach.\n\nWait, mass point assigns masses so that masses at B and C are proportional to the opposite segments. Wait, but since BP/PC =1/2, then mass at B is 2 and mass at C is1 so that 2/1 = PC/BP. Wait, mass points: mass at B over mass at C equals PC/BP. Since BP/PC=1/2, so PC/BP=2, so mass at B/mass at C = PC/BP=2, so mass at B is 2, mass at C is1.\n\nThen the mass at P would be mass B + mass C =3.\n\nBut also, considering the angle condition angle ABP = angle ACP. Hmm, not sure how to translate that into mass point.\n\nAlternatively, using barycentric coordinates.\n\nLet me recall that in barycentric coordinates, the coordinates (u, v, w) correspond to the point P such that:\n\nP = uA + vB + wC, with u + v + w =1.\n\nThe area ratios can be given by the weights. The area [BPC]/[ABC] = u, [APB]/[ABC]=w, [APC]/[ABC]=v, but I might have that backwards. Wait, actually in barycentric coordinates, the weights correspond to the areas opposite the respective vertices. Let me confirm:\n\nIn barycentric coordinates, the coordinates (u, v, w) correspond to masses such that [PBC]/[ABC]=u, [APC]/[ABC]=v, [APB]/[ABC]=w. So yes, the first coordinate u is the ratio of [PBC] to [ABC], etc.\n\nTherefore, if I can find the barycentric coordinates of P, then u will be the answer.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can set up equations based on the given conditions.\n\nFirst, we know that BP/PC =1/2. In barycentric coordinates, the ratio BP/PC can be related to the coordinates.\n\nWait, perhaps using the ratio along the line BC? Wait, but BP and PC are not along BC. Hmm, maybe need to use vector approach.\n\nAlternatively, the mass point idea earlier: masses at B and C are 1 and 2 (since BP/PC=1/2, so mass at B is proportional to PC, mass at C proportional to BP). So masses at B:1, C:2, so mass at P is 3.\n\nBut then we also need to consider the angle condition. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since angle ABP = angle ACP, which might relate to some isogonal conjugacy, but that might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to define variables in barycentric coordinates.\n\nLet P have barycentric coordinates (u, v, w) with u + v + w =1.\n\nWe need to find u = [BPC]/[ABC].\n\nFirst, the ratio BP/PC =1/2. To express this in barycentric coordinates, perhaps we need to compute the distances BP and PC in terms of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, in barycentric coordinates, the distance formulas are complicated, but perhaps the mass point approach can be used with the masses.\n\nIf masses at B and C are 1 and 2, then the mass at P is 3, so in barycentric coordinates, the masses correspond to the coordinates. Wait, barycentric coordinates are usually normalized such that they sum to 1, but masses can be scaled.\n\nAlternatively, mass at A is some m, mass at B is1, mass at C is2. Then the mass at P is m +1 +2, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the angle condition angle ABP = angle ACP can be expressed in terms of barycentric coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to use vectors.\n\nLet me consider vectors. Let me set point A as the origin, so vector A is (0,0). Let me denote vectors AB as vector b, and AC as vector c. Then any point P can be expressed as P = xb + yc, where x and y are scalars such that x + y \u22641 (but since P is inside, x + y <1 and x,y >0). Wait, actually in barycentric coordinates, it's more like P = uA + vB + wC with u + v + w=1, so in vector terms, P = vB + wC since A is origin.\n\nWait, let me rephrase:\n\nLet me set coordinate system with point A at origin, vector AB as vector **b**, and vector AC as vector **c**. Then coordinates:\n\nPoint A: 0 (origin)\n\nPoint B: **b**\n\nPoint C: **c**\n\nPoint P: can be written as P = **b** + t(**c** - **b**) or something, but maybe better to use barycentric coordinates.\n\nIn terms of barycentric coordinates, P can be expressed as P = \u03b1A + \u03b2B + \u03b3C with \u03b1 + \u03b2 + \u03b3 =1. Since A is origin, P = \u03b2**b** + \u03b3**c**.\n\nThe condition angle ABP = angle ACP.\n\nHmm, angle at B between BA and BP equals angle at C between CA and CP.\n\nExpressed in vectors, BA is vector A - B = -**b**, BP is P - B = (\u03b2**b** + \u03b3**c** ) - **b** = (\u03b2 -1)**b** + \u03b3**c**\n\nSimilarly, at point C: CA is vector A - C = -**c**, CP is P - C = (\u03b2**b** + \u03b3**c** ) - **c** = \u03b2**b** + (\u03b3 -1)**c**\n\nThe angles between these vectors must be equal.\n\nThe cosine of the angle between BA and BP is equal to the cosine between CA and CP.\n\nSo:\n\n[ (-**b**) \u00b7 ( (\u03b2 -1)**b** + \u03b3**c** ) ] / ( |**b**| |BP| ) = [ (-**c**) \u00b7 ( \u03b2**b** + (\u03b3 -1)**c** ) ] / ( |**c**| |CP| )\n\nThis is similar to the earlier equation in coordinate approach, but maybe with vectors.\n\nLet me compute each dot product.\n\nFirst numerator left side:\n\n(-**b**) \u00b7 [ (\u03b2 -1)**b** + \u03b3**c** ] = - (\u03b2 -1)(**b** \u00b7 **b**) - \u03b3(**b** \u00b7 **c** )\n\nSimilarly, right side numerator:\n\n(-**c**) \u00b7 [ \u03b2**b** + (\u03b3 -1)**c** ] = - \u03b2(**b** \u00b7 **c**) - (\u03b3 -1)(**c** \u00b7 **c** )\n\nThe denominators:\n\nLeft side denominator: |**b**| |BP|. |**b**| is AB=6. |BP| is the norm of vector BP = sqrt( |(\u03b2 -1)**b** + \u03b3**c**|\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, right side denominator: |**c**| |CP|. |**c**| is AC=8. |CP| is norm of vector CP = sqrt( |\u03b2**b** + (\u03b3 -1)**c**|\u00b2 )\n\nThis seems too involved, but perhaps if I can express **b** \u00b7 **c** in terms of the sides.\n\nRecall that **b** \u00b7 **c** = |**b**||**c**|cos(angle at A). Let me compute angle at A first. Using Law of Cosines:\n\ncos \u03b1 = (AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 - BC\u00b2)/(2 AB AC) = (6\u00b2 +8\u00b2 -7\u00b2)/(2*6*8)= (36+64-49)/96=(51)/96=17/32\n\nThus, **b** \u00b7 **c** = 6*8*(17/32) = 48*(17)/32 = (48/32)*17= (3/2)*17=51/2=25.5. Wait, 6*8 is 48, 48*(17/32)= (48/32)*17= (3/2)*17=51/2=25.5. Okay, so **b** \u00b7 **c** =51/2.\n\nAlso, |**b**|\u00b2 = AB\u00b2=36, |**c**|\u00b2=AC\u00b2=64.\n\nSo let me plug these into the equations.\n\nLeft numerator:\n\n- (\u03b2 -1)(36) - \u03b3*(51/2 )\n\nRight numerator:\n\n- \u03b2*(51/2) - (\u03b3 -1)(64 )\n\nDenominators:\n\nLeft denominator: 6 * |BP|, where |BP|\u00b2 = |(\u03b2 -1)**b** + \u03b3**c**|\u00b2 = (\u03b2 -1)^2 |**b**|\u00b2 + \u03b3\u00b2 |**c**|\u00b2 + 2(\u03b2 -1)\u03b3 (**b** \u00b7 **c** )\n\n= (\u03b2 -1)^2 *36 + \u03b3\u00b2 *64 + 2(\u03b2 -1)\u03b3*(51/2 )\n\nSimilarly, |CP|\u00b2 = |\u03b2**b** + (\u03b3 -1)**c**|\u00b2 = \u03b2\u00b2 |**b**|\u00b2 + (\u03b3 -1)^2 |**c**|\u00b2 + 2\u03b2(\u03b3 -1)(**b** \u00b7 **c** )\n\n= \u03b2\u00b2 *36 + (\u03b3 -1)^2 *64 + 2\u03b2(\u03b3 -1)*(51/2 )\n\nThis is getting very algebra-heavy. Maybe there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, since we have two conditions: BP/PC =1/2 and angle ABP = angle ACP, perhaps we can set variables for coordinates and solve the equations numerically or find a ratio.\n\nWait, let me recall that the ratio [BPC]/[ABC] is equal to the barycentric coordinate u, so if I can find u, that's the answer. Let me see if I can express the conditions in terms of barycentric coordinates.\n\nLet me denote barycentric coordinates as P = (u, v, w), so u + v + w=1, and [BPC]/[ABC] = u.\n\nThe ratio BP/PC =1/2. Hmm, in barycentric coordinates, BP and PC are lengths, which is more complicated. Alternatively, if we can write the mass point ratios.\n\nWait, mass point: if masses at B and C are m_B and m_C such that m_B / m_C = PC / BP =2/1, so masses at B is 1, C is2. Then the mass at P would be 3. Then the mass at A is unknown. The total mass at P is mass_A + mass_B + mass_C. Wait, but in mass point geometry, masses are assigned such that the mass at a vertex is proportional to the length of the opposite side? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since we have the angle condition, perhaps combining mass point with trigonometric relations.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem in terms of the given ratio and the angle condition. Let me suppose that the line from B to P and the line from C to P make equal angles with BA and CA respectively. Maybe reflecting point P over some axis?\n\nAlternatively, use the Angle Bisector Theorem, but the angles are equal but not necessarily bisecting anything.\n\nAlternatively, construct point Q such that Q is the reflection of P over the angle bisector or something. Hmm, not sure.\n\nWait, another idea: Since angles ABP and ACP are equal, perhaps there is a circle involved. Maybe point P lies on some circle?\n\nAlternatively, use trigonometric identities to relate the areas.\n\nWait, let me consider the areas of triangles ABP and ACP.\n\nThe area of triangle ABP is (1/2)*AB*BP*sin(theta) where theta is angle ABP.\n\nSimilarly, area of ACP is (1/2)*AC*CP*sin(theta).\n\nGiven that angle ABP = angle ACP = theta, and BP/PC =1/2.\n\nLet me denote BP =x, so PC=2x.\n\nThus,\n\nArea ABP = (1/2)*6*x*sin(theta)\n\nArea ACP = (1/2)*8*(2x)*sin(theta)= (1/2)*16x sin(theta)= 8x sin(theta)\n\nThus, the ratio of areas ABP to ACP is (3x sin(theta)) / (8x sin(theta)) )= 3/8.\n\nSo [ABP]/[ACP] = 3/8.\n\nHmm, that's a useful relation.\n\nAdditionally, the total area of ABC can be computed using Heron's formula.\n\nCompute sides: AB=6, AC=8, BC=7.\n\nPerimeter semiperimeter s=(6+8+7)/2=21/2=10.5\n\nArea = sqrt( s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c) )= sqrt(10.5*(10.5-6)(10.5-8)(10.5-7))\n\nCompute each term:\n\n10.5 -6=4.5, 10.5-8=2.5, 10.5-7=3.5\n\nThus,\n\nArea ABC= sqrt(10.5 *4.5 *2.5 *3.5 )\n\nHmm, compute this:\n\nFirst, note that 10.5 =21/2, 4.5=9/2, 2.5=5/2, 3.5=7/2.\n\nThus product: (21/2)*(9/2)*(5/2)*(7/2) = (21*9*5*7)/(2^4)= (21*9*35)/16\n\nWait, 21*9=189, 189*35: 189*30=5670, 189*5=945 \u2192 total 6615.\n\nThus numerator: 6615, denominator 16.\n\nSo area ABC = sqrt(6615/16)= sqrt(6615)/4.\n\nCompute sqrt(6615):\n\nLet me factor 6615:\n\nDivide by 5: 6615/5=1323.\n\n1323 divided by 3: 441, again divide by 3:147, again divide by 3:49. So 6615=5\u00d73^3\u00d77^2.\n\nThus sqrt(6615)=sqrt(5\u00d73^3\u00d77^2)=3^(1.5)*7*sqrt(5)=3*sqrt(3)*7*sqrt(5)=21 sqrt(15).\n\nWait:\n\nWait, 6615 = 5 \u00d7 3^3 \u00d7 7^2.\n\nThus sqrt(6615) = sqrt(5 * 3^3 *7^2) = 7 *3^(3/2)*sqrt(5) = 7*3*sqrt(3)*sqrt(5)=21 sqrt(15).\n\nTherefore area ABC is 21\u221a15 /4.\n\nOkay, so area ABC is 21\u221a15 /4.\n\nNow, going back to the areas of ABP and ACP, their ratio is 3/8. Let me denote [ABP]=3k, [ACP]=8k.\n\nThe total area of ABC is the sum of [ABP], [APC], [BPC], and [APB]. Wait, no, actually, need to partition the triangle correctly.\n\nWait, actually, the areas of ABP, BPC, and APC, along with the area around AP, but perhaps it's better to see that:\n\nThe entire area [ABC] = [ABP] + [APC] + [BPC] ?\n\nWait, no, because AP divides the triangle into ABP and APC, but also there's BPC. Wait, actually, need to think of the areas properly.\n\nAlternatively, the areas [ABP], [APC], and [BPC] plus another area?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps:\n\nThe point P divides the triangle into three smaller triangles: ABP, BPC, and APC, and the central triangle APB? Wait, no, actually, the three triangles are ABP, BPC, and APC, and also the triangle APC is overlapping?\n\nWait, no, actually, in a triangle with an interior point, the three cevians from the vertices to P divide the triangle into three smaller triangles: ABP, BPC, and APC, and the central quadrilateral? Wait no, actually, if you connect P to all three vertices, you get three triangles: ABP, BCP, and ACP, which together make up the whole triangle ABC. Wait, yes:\n\nYes, if you have point P inside triangle ABC, connecting P to A, B, and C divides ABC into three smaller triangles: ABP, BCP, and ACP. So:\n\n[ABC] = [ABP] + [BPC] + [APC]\n\nWait, but in our earlier calculation, we had [ABP] =3k, [ACP]=8k. But then where is [BPC]?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider more relations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet [ABP] = 3k,\n\n[ACP] =8k,\n\nand let [BPC] = m,\n\nthen [ABC]= 3k +8k +m=11k +m.\n\nBut we need another equation to relate m and k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the ratio BP/PC=1/2 and some area ratios.\n\nAlternatively, consider the ratio of areas involving BP and PC.\n\nWait, the ratio BP/PC =1/2. If I consider triangles that share the same height, then their areas would be in the ratio of their bases. But since BP and PC are not along the same line, this might not apply directly.\n\nAlternatively, look at triangles BPC and BPC? Not sure.\n\nWait, let me think of the areas in terms of the cevians.\n\nAlternatively, since we have angle ABP = angle ACP = theta, and we have expressions for [ABP] and [ACP], maybe relate them to other areas.\n\nWait, let me consider triangles involving P and the sides.\n\nAlternatively, using the Law of Sines in triangles ABP and ACP:\n\nIn triangle ABP:\n\nAB / sin(angle APB) = BP / sin(angle BAP)\n\nIn triangle ACP:\n\nAC / sin(angle APC) = CP / sin(angle CAP)\n\nBut angle APB and angle APC are related since they are angles at P in different triangles. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle BPC, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the entire area [ABC] = 21\u221a15 /4 as computed earlier.\n\nWe need to find [BPC]/[ABC].\n\nIf I can express [BPC] in terms of k, then since [ABC] =11k + m, but I need another equation.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the areas in terms of coordinates again but try to set variables.\n\nLet me suppose coordinates for P as (p,q). Then areas can be computed via determinants.\n\nCoordinates of A(0,0), B(6,0), C(17/4, 7\u221a15/4). Let me denote P as (x,y).\n\nThe area [ABP] is (1/2)* | (6*y -0*(x -6)) | = (1/2)*6y = 3y.\n\nSimilarly, [ACP] is (1/2)* | x*(7\u221a15/4) - (17/4)*y |. Because the area of ACP can be computed as determinant:\n\n(1/2)| (0*(7\u221a15/4 - 0) + (17/4)(0 - y) +x*(y -0) ) | = (1/2)| -17/4 y + x y | = (1/2)| y(x -17/4) |.\n\nSo [ACP] = (1/2)| y(x -17/4) |. Since P is inside the triangle, the sign should be positive, so [ACP] = (1/2)y(x -17/4).\n\nWait, but if x is less than 17/4, then x-17/4 is negative, but area is positive, so absolute value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction. Let me recalculate [ACP]:\n\nUsing coordinates A(0,0), C(17/4,7\u221a15/4), P(x,y).\n\nThe area is 1/2 | (Ax(By - Cy) + Cx(Cy - Ay) + Px(Ay - By) ) |, but maybe better to use the shoelace formula.\n\nAlternatively, the area of triangle ACP can be calculated as 1/2 | (Ax(Cy - Py) + Cx(Py - Ay) + Px(Ay - Cy) ) |.\n\nPlugging in A(0,0), C(17/4,7\u221a15/4), P(x,y):\n\n=1/2 | 0*(7\u221a15/4 - y) + (17/4)*(y -0) +x*(0 -7\u221a15/4) |\n\n=1/2 | (17/4)y - (7\u221a15/4)x |.\n\nThus, [ACP] = (1/2)| (17y -7\u221a15 x)/4 | = (1/8)|17y -7\u221a15 x|.\n\nHmm, but since P is inside the triangle, the expression inside might be positive or negative depending on position. Need to keep track.\n\nSimilarly, the area [BPC] can be calculated using coordinates.\n\nPoints B(6,0), P(x,y), C(17/4,7\u221a15/4).\n\nArea [BPC]=1/2 | (6*(7\u221a15/4 -0) + x*(0 -7\u221a15/4) +17/4*(y -0) ) |.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n6*(7\u221a15/4) =42\u221a15/4 =21\u221a15/2,\n\nx*(-7\u221a15/4) = -7\u221a15 x /4,\n\n17/4 * y =17y/4.\n\nThus,\n\nArea [BPC]=1/2 |21\u221a15/2 -7\u221a15 x /4 +17y/4 |.\n\nHmm, this is getting very involved. Maybe I can use the earlier relations.\n\nWe had [ABP] = 3y (from earlier calculation: area A(0,0), B(6,0), P(x,y): 1/2*base*height = 1/2*6*y).\n\nSimilarly, [ACP] is (1/8)|17y -7\u221a15 x|, but since inside the triangle, perhaps the expression is positive?\n\nWait, perhaps better to set up equations based on the given ratio BP/PC =1/2 and angle condition.\n\nFirst, the ratio BP/PC =1/2. BP and PC are lengths:\n\nBP = sqrt( (x -6)^2 + y^2 ),\n\nPC = sqrt( (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2 ).\n\nThus,\n\nBP / PC =1/2 \u21d2 sqrt( (x-6)^2 + y\u00b2 ) / sqrt( (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2 ) = 1/2\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n[(x-6)^2 + y\u00b2 ] / [ (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2 ] =1/4\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n4[(x-6)^2 + y\u00b2 ] = (x -17/4)^2 + (y -7\u221a15/4)^2\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side:\n\n4(x\u00b2 -12x +36 + y\u00b2 )\n\n=4x\u00b2 -48x +144 +4y\u00b2\n\nRight side:\n\n(x\u00b2 - (17/2)x + (17/4)^2 ) + (y\u00b2 - (7\u221a15/2)y + (7\u221a15/4)^2 )\n\nWait, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (x -17/4)^2 =x\u00b2 - (34/4)x + (17/4)^2 =x\u00b2 - (17/2)x + 289/16\n\nSecond term: (y -7\u221a15/4)^2= y\u00b2 - (7\u221a15/2)y + (49*15)/16 = y\u00b2 - (7\u221a15/2)y + 735/16\n\nThus, sum:\n\nx\u00b2 - (17/2)x +289/16 + y\u00b2 - (7\u221a15/2)y +735/16\n\nCombine constants: (289 +735)/16 = 1024/16=64\n\nSo total right side:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (17/2)x - (7\u221a15/2)y +64\n\nTherefore equation:\n\nLeft side:4x\u00b2 -48x +144 +4y\u00b2 = right side: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (17/2)x - (7\u221a15/2)y +64\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n4x\u00b2 -48x +144 +4y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 -y\u00b2 + (17/2)x + (7\u221a15/2)y -64=0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(4x\u00b2 -x\u00b2)=3x\u00b2,\n\n(4y\u00b2 -y\u00b2)=3y\u00b2,\n\n(-48x +17/2 x)= (-96/2 x +17/2 x)= (-79/2)x,\n\n(144 -64)=80,\n\nand +(7\u221a15/2)y.\n\nThus:\n\n3x\u00b2 +3y\u00b2 - (79/2)x + (7\u221a15/2)y +80 =0\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n6x\u00b2 +6y\u00b2 -79x +7\u221a15 y +160 =0 ...(Equation 1)\n\nThat's one equation from the BP/PC ratio.\n\nNow, the other condition is angle ABP = angle ACP. Which we had tried earlier with the cosine equation. This would give another equation involving x and y.\n\nEarlier, we had the equation from the angle condition:\n\n- (p -6)/ |BP| = [ - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15/4) q + 64 ] / (8 |CP| )\n\nBut substituting p=x and q=y, and since BP and CP are sqrt expressions, this would be another complicated equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the sine areas.\n\nWe had earlier:\n\n[ABP] =3y,\n\n[ACP]=(1/8)|17y -7\u221a15 x|,\n\nand the ratio [ABP]/[ACP]=3/8.\n\nAssuming the areas are positive, then:\n\n3y / [ (1/8)(17y -7\u221a15 x) ] =3/8,\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, [ABP]/[ACP]=3/8,\n\nThus,\n\n3y / [ (1/8)(17y -7\u221a15 x) ] = 3/8.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n3y *8 = (3/8)*(1/8)(17y -7\u221a15 x)*8 ?\n\nWait, perhaps better:\n\nLet me write:\n\n[ABP]/[ACP] = (3y) / [ (1/8)(17y -7\u221a15 x) ] = 3/8,\n\nThus,\n\n3y / [ (17y -7\u221a15 x)/8 ] = 3/8,\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n3y = (3/8)*(17y -7\u221a15 x)/8 ?\n\nWait, no, let me re-arrange:\n\nThe equation is:\n\n(3y) / [ (1/8)(17y -7\u221a15x) ] = 3/8\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 8:\n\n(24y)/(17y -7\u221a15x ) = 3/8\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n24y *8 =3*(17y -7\u221a15x )\n\n192y =51y -21\u221a15 x\n\nBring terms to left:\n\n192y -51y +21\u221a15 x =0 \u21d2141y +21\u221a15 x =0\n\nThus,\n\n21\u221a15 x = -141y \u21d2 x= (-141y)/(21\u221a15 )= (-47y)/(7\u221a15 )\n\nHmm, this gives a relation between x and y. Let me write this as:\n\nx = - (47)/(7\u221a15) y\n\nHmm, but this suggests that x is negative if y is positive, but since point P is inside the triangle ABC, which has coordinates x between 0 and max(6,17/4\u22484.25). Wait, 17/4 is 4.25, so the triangle's x-coordinate ranges from 0 to 6. So if x is negative, that would place P outside the triangle, which contradicts the given that P is inside. Therefore, perhaps the assumption about the sign in the area formula was incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the area expressions.\n\nLet me re-derive [ACP].\n\nPoints A(0,0), C(17/4,7\u221a15/4), P(x,y).\n\nThe area is 1/2 | determinant |:\n\n=1/2 | (0*(7\u221a15/4 - y) +17/4*(y -0) +x*(0 -7\u221a15/4)) |\n\n=1/2 | (17/4 y - (7\u221a15/4)x ) |.\n\nSo [ACP] = (1/2)(17/4 y -7\u221a15/4 x ) if the expression inside is positive.\n\nBut since P is inside the triangle, which side of the line AC is P?\n\nThe coordinates of C are (17/4,7\u221a15/4). Since the triangle is between A(0,0), B(6,0), and C(17/4\u22484.25, positive y). So the triangle is such that point C is above and to the right of A, but left of B (since 17/4 is 4.25 <6). So the triangle is non-degenerate.\n\nTo be inside the triangle, P should be in the region where x between 0 and 6, y between 0 and the line AC or BC.\n\nThe expression 17/4 y -7\u221a15/4 x must be positive? Not sure. Let me think: when P is at point C, x=17/4, y=7\u221a15/4, then 17/4 y -7\u221a15/4 x =17/4*(7\u221a15/4) -7\u221a15/4*(17/4)=0. So at point C, it's zero. Similarly at point A, x=0,y=0 gives zero. So the expression inside the absolute value could be positive or negative depending on the location.\n\nIf P is inside, maybe the expression is positive. Let me suppose so.\n\nThus, [ACP]= (1/2)( (17y -7\u221a15 x)/4 )\n\n= (17y -7\u221a15 x)/8.\n\nTherefore, the ratio [ABP]/[ACP] = 3y / [(17y -7\u221a15 x)/8] = 24y/(17y -7\u221a15x ) =3/8.\n\nSetting this equal to 3/8 gives 24y / (17y -7\u221a15 x ) = 3/8 \u21d2 cross multiply:\n\n24y *8 =3*(17y -7\u221a15x )\n\n192y =51y -21\u221a15x \u21d2 141y = -21\u221a15x \u21d2x = - (141)/(21\u221a15) y = - (47)/(7\u221a15) y\n\nSame as before. Hmm, so this suggests x is negative when y is positive. But that contradicts P being inside the triangle. Therefore, perhaps the expression inside the absolute value was negative, so [ACP] = (7\u221a15x -17y)/8.\n\nTherefore, the ratio would be [ABP]/[ACP] =3y / [ (7\u221a15 x -17y)/8 ] = 24y/(7\u221a15x -17y)=3/8.\n\nThen 24y / (7\u221a15x -17y)=3/8 \u21d2 24y*8=3(7\u221a15x -17y )\n\n192y=21\u221a15x -51y \u21d2192y+51y =21\u221a15x \u21d2243y=21\u221a15x \u21d2 x=(243)/(21\u221a15)y= (81)/(7\u221a15)y= simplifying:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a15: (81\u221a15)/(7*15)= (27\u221a15)/35 y.\n\nThus, x=(27\u221a15/35)y\n\nThis gives a positive x if y is positive, which makes sense since P is inside the triangle.\n\nSo, the correct relation is x= (27\u221a15 /35) y.\n\nOkay, so that's equation 2: x = (27\u221a15 /35)y ...(Equation 2)\n\nNow, substitute this into Equation 1:\n\n6x\u00b2 +6y\u00b2 -79x +7\u221a15 y +160 =0\n\nReplace x with (27\u221a15 /35)y:\n\nFirst compute x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = (27\u221a15 /35 y)^2 = (27\u00b2 *15)/ (35\u00b2) y\u00b2 = (729*15)/1225 y\u00b2 = 10935/1225 y\u00b2 = 2187/245 y\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, x = (27\u221a15 /35)y,\n\nPlug into Equation 1:\n\n6*(2187/245 y\u00b2) +6y\u00b2 -79*(27\u221a15 /35 y) +7\u221a15 y +160 =0\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 6*(2187/245)y\u00b2 = (13122)/245 y\u00b2\n\nSecond term:6y\u00b2 = 6*(245/245) y\u00b2=1470/245 y\u00b2\n\nThird term: -79*(27\u221a15)/35 y = - (2133\u221a15)/35 y\n\nFourth term:+7\u221a15 y = + (245\u221a15)/35 y\n\nFifth term:+160\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor y\u00b2 terms:\n\n13122/245 +1470/245 = (13122 +1470)/245 =14592/245 y\u00b2\n\nFor y terms:\n\n[ -2133\u221a15/35 +245\u221a15/35 ] y = [ (-2133 +245)\u221a15 /35 ] y = (-1888\u221a15)/35 y\n\nConstant term:+160\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n(14592/245)y\u00b2 - (1888\u221a15/35)y +160 =0\n\nMultiply all terms by 245 to eliminate denominators:\n\n14592 y\u00b2 - (1888\u221a15/35)*245 y +160*245 =0\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term remains 14592 y\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: (1888\u221a15/35)*245 =1888\u221a15*(245/35)=1888\u221a15*7=13216\u221a15 y\n\nThird term:160*245=160*(200+45)=32000+7200=39200\n\nThus equation:\n\n14592 y\u00b2 -13216\u221a15 y +39200 =0\n\nHmm, this is a quadratic in y. Let me write it as:\n\n14592 y\u00b2 -13216\u221a15 y +39200 =0\n\nThis is quite a complex equation. Let me see if I can divide by a common factor. Let me check if coefficients have a common divisor.\n\n14592, 13216, 39200.\n\n14592 \u00f7 16= 912, 13216\u00f716=826, 39200\u00f716=2450. Not sure if further common factors.\n\nAlternatively, use quadratic formula:\n\nLet me denote a=14592, b= -13216\u221a15, c=39200.\n\nThen discriminant D= b\u00b2 -4ac.\n\nCompute D:\n\n(13216\u221a15)^2 -4*14592*39200\n\nFirst term:13216\u00b2 *15\n\nSecond term:4*14592*39200\n\nThis is going to be very large. Maybe factor out common terms.\n\nAlternatively, notice that this is very cumbersome and perhaps there's an error in approach. Maybe going back to barycentric coordinates would have been better?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations earlier. Let me check steps again.\n\nWait, when I set up the ratio [ABP]/[ACP] =3/8, the areas are [ABP]=3y and [ACP]= (7\u221a15x -17y)/8, so:\n\n3y / [(7\u221a15x -17y)/8] =24y/(7\u221a15x -17y)=3/8.\n\nCross multiplying gives 192y =21\u221a15x -51y \u2192192y +51y=21\u221a15x \u2192243y=21\u221a15x \u2192x=(243)/(21\u221a15) y.\n\nYes, that's correct. Simplify:\n\n243/21 =81/7, so x=(81/7\u221a15)y.\n\nWhich is same as (81\u221a15)/(7*15)= (27\u221a15)/35 y. Wait, no:\n\nWait, (81)/(7\u221a15) can be rationalized as (81\u221a15)/(7*15) = (27\u221a15)/35. Yes, so x=(27\u221a15/35)y.\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nThen substituting into equation 1:\n\nYes, steps were correct, leading to the quadratic equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assign a value to y to simplify. Let me let y = k, then x= (27\u221a15/35)k. Plug into equation 1:\n\n6x\u00b2 +6y\u00b2 -79x +7\u221a15 y +160 =0.\n\nLet me compute each term with x= (27\u221a15/35)k and y=k:\n\nx\u00b2 = (27\u221a15/35)^2 k\u00b2= (27\u00b2 *15)/35\u00b2 k\u00b2= 2187/245 k\u00b2\n\nThus,\n\n6x\u00b2 =6*(2187/245)k\u00b2=13122/245 k\u00b2,\n\n6y\u00b2=6k\u00b2,\n\n-79x =-79*(27\u221a15/35)k,\n\n+7\u221a15 y =7\u221a15 k,\n\n+160.\n\nSo,\n\nTotal equation:\n\n13122/245 k\u00b2 +6k\u00b2 - (79*27\u221a15/35)k +7\u221a15 k +160 =0\n\nCombine terms:\n\nFirst two terms:\n\n13122/245 k\u00b2 +6k\u00b2 = (13122 +6*245)/245 k\u00b2 = (13122 +1470)/245 k\u00b2 =14592/245 k\u00b2\n\nThen next terms:\n\n- (2133\u221a15)/35 k +7\u221a15 k = [ -2133/35 +7 ]\u221a15 k = [ -2133/35 +245/35 ]\u221a15 k = (-1888/35)\u221a15 k\n\nHence:\n\n14592/245 k\u00b2 - (1888\u221a15)/35 k +160=0\n\nMultiply all terms by 245:\n\n14592k\u00b2 - (1888\u221a15 *7)k +160*245=0 \u2192 same as before.\n\nThis is very involved. Perhaps approximate numerically?\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote y as a variable and compute.\n\nLet me denote variables numerically.\n\nFirst, \u221a15\u22483.87298\n\nCompute the coefficients:\n\na=14592,\n\nb= -13216*3.87298\u2248-13216*3.87298\u2248-13216*3.87\u2248-13216*3 -13216*0.87\u2248-39648 -11495\u2248-51143,\n\nWait, let me compute 13216*3.87298:\n\n13216*3=39648,\n\n13216*0.87298\u224813216*0.8=10572.8; 13216*0.07298\u2248963. So total\u224810572.8+963\u224811535.8,\n\nThus total b\u2248- (39648+11535.8)= -51183.8.\n\nc=39200.\n\nThus equation \u224814592 y\u00b2 -51183.8 y +39200 =0\n\nNow, use quadratic formula:\n\ny = [51183.8 \u00b1\u221a(51183.8\u00b2 -4*14592*39200)]/(2*14592)\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\n\u224851183.8\u00b2 -4*14592*39200\n\nFirst term: ~51183.8\u00b2 \u2248 (5e4)^2=2.5e9, but precise:\n\n51183.8^2 \u224851183.8*51183.8.

But my earlier approximate got 0.39, which is close to 3/8=0.375.\n\nWait, but let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the barycentric coordinates. Suppose that the ratio [BPC]/[ABC] is u, which is what we need.\n\nFrom the angle condition and mass point, perhaps there is a better way.\n\nWait, going back to the trigonometric Ceva equation.\n\nWe had earlier:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 = 2 sin(beta - theta) sin(gamma - theta)\n\nWhere beta and gamma are angles at B and C.\n\nWith beta = angle at B, gamma angle at C.\n\nWe have expressions for sin beta, cos beta, sin gamma, cos gamma.\n\nLet me denote theta as the common angle.\n\nLet me plug in the known values.\n\nFirst, beta angle has cos beta=1/4, so sin beta=\u221a15/4.\n\nGamma has cos gamma=11/16, so sin gamma=3\u221a15/16.\n\nLet me write the equation:\n\nsin\u00b2(theta) =2 sin(beta - theta) sin(gamma - theta)\n\nExpand the RHS using sine subtraction formulas:\n\nsin(beta - theta) = sin beta cos theta - cos beta sin theta,\n\nsin(gamma - theta)= sin gamma cos theta - cos gamma sin theta.\n\nThus,\n\nRHS=2[ sin beta cos theta - cos beta sin theta ][ sin gamma cos theta - cos gamma sin theta ]\n\nThis is similar to earlier steps.\n\nMultiply out the terms:\n\n=2[ sin beta sin gamma cos\u00b2 theta - sin beta cos gamma cos theta sin theta - cos beta sin gamma cos theta sin theta + cos beta cos gamma sin\u00b2 theta ]\n\nThus,\n\nsin\u00b2 theta = 2[ sin beta sin gamma cos\u00b2 theta - (sin beta cos gamma + cos beta sin gamma) cos theta sin theta + cos beta cos gamma sin\u00b2 theta ]\n\nLet me collect terms by powers of cos\u00b2 theta, cos theta sin theta, sin\u00b2 theta.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nsin\u00b2 theta - 2 sin beta sin gamma cos\u00b2 theta + 2(sin beta cos gamma + cos beta sin gamma) cos theta sin theta - 2 cos beta cos gamma sin\u00b2 theta =0\n\nLet me factor terms:\n\nGroup terms with cos\u00b2 theta:\n\n-2 sin beta sin gamma cos\u00b2 theta,\n\nTerms with cos theta sin theta:\n\n+2(sin beta cos gamma + cos beta sin gamma) cos theta sin theta,\n\nTerms with sin\u00b2 theta:\n\nsin\u00b2 theta - 2 cos beta cos gamma sin\u00b2 theta.\n\nLet me factor sin\u00b2 theta terms:\n\nsin\u00b2 theta (1 - 2 cos beta cos gamma )\n\nAnd cos\u00b2 theta terms:\n\n-2 sin beta sin gamma cos\u00b2 theta,\n\nand the cross term:\n\n+2 (sin beta cos gamma + cos beta sin gamma) cos theta sin theta.\n\nThis equation can be written as:\n\n-2 sin beta sin gamma cos\u00b2 theta + 2 (sin beta cos gamma + cos beta sin gamma) cos theta sin theta + sin\u00b2 theta (1 - 2 cos beta cos gamma ) =0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of cos theta and sin theta.

Alternatively, maybe divide the equation by sin\u00b2 theta to convert to cotangent terms.\n\nLet me divide all terms by sin\u00b2 theta \u22600:\n\n-2 sin beta sin gamma (cos\u00b2 theta / sin\u00b2 theta) + 2 (sin beta cos gamma + cos beta sin gamma)(cos theta / sin theta ) + (1 - 2 cos beta cos gamma ) =0\n\nLet me set cot theta = t, so cos theta / sin theta = t, and cos\u00b2 theta / sin\u00b2 theta = t\u00b2.\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n-2 sin beta sin gamma t\u00b2 + 2(sin beta cos gamma + cos beta sin gamma) t + (1 - 2 cos beta cos gamma ) =0\n\nThis is a quadratic in t.\n\nLet me compute coefficients:\n\nFirst term coefficient: -2 sin beta sin gamma.\n\nSecond term coefficient:2 ( sin beta cos gamma + cos beta sin gamma ) = 2 sin(beta + gamma).\n\nThird term:1 -2 cos beta cos gamma.\n\nNote that beta + gamma = 180\u00b0 - alpha, since in a triangle angles sum to 180\u00b0.\n\nBut sin(beta + gamma)=sin(180\u00b0 - alpha)=sin alpha.\n\nThus,\n\nSecond term coefficient= 2 sin alpha.\n\nThird term: 1 -2 cos beta cos gamma.\n\nAlso, compute sin beta sin gamma and cos beta cos gamma.\n\nGiven:\n\nsin beta =\u221a15/4, cos beta=1/4,\n\nsin gamma =3\u221a15/16, cos gamma=11/16.\n\nCompute sin beta sin gamma = (\u221a15/4)(3\u221a15/16)= (3*15)/(4*16)=45/64,\n\ncos beta cos gamma=(1/4)(11/16)=11/64,\n\nsin alpha: since alpha is angle at A, computed earlier cos alpha=17/32,\n\nThus sin alpha= sqrt(1 - (17/32)^2)=sqrt( (1024-289)/1024 )=sqrt(735/1024)= (sqrt(735))/32. sqrt(735)=sqrt(49*15)=7\u221a15,\n\nThus sin alpha=7\u221a15/32.\n\nSo now plug into the quadratic equation:\n\n-2*(45/64) t\u00b2 +2*(7\u221a15/32) t + (1 -2*(11/64))=0\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: -2*(45/64)= -90/64 = -45/32,\n\nSecond term:14\u221a15/32,\n\nThird term:1 -22/64= (64-22)/64=42/64=21/32,\n\nThus equation:\n\n-45/32 t\u00b2 +14\u221a15/32 t +21/32 =0\n\nMultiply all terms by 32 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-45 t\u00b2 +14\u221a15 t +21=0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n45t\u00b2 -14\u221a15 t -21=0\n\nNow solve for t = cot theta:\n\nt = [14\u221a15 \u00b1 sqrt( (14\u221a15)^2 +4*45*21 ) ]/(2*45)\n\nCompute discriminant D:\n\n(14\u221a15)^2 +4*45*21 =14\u00b2*15 + 3780= 2940 +3780=6720,\n\nSame as before sqrt(D)=sqrt(6720)=8\u221a105.\n\nThus,\n\nt= [14\u221a15 \u00b18\u221a105]/90\n\nWe take the positive solution since theta is between 0 and beta or gamma.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n14\u221a15 +8\u221a105? Or minus?\n\nWait, need to ensure cot theta is positive because theta is between 0 and angle B or C.\n\nAssuming theta is acute, cot theta positive.\n\nThus take the positive root:\n\nt= [14\u221a15 +8\u221a105]/90? Or is it minus?\n\nWait, equation is:\n\nt = [14\u221a15 \u00b18\u221a105]/90\n\nWe need to choose the sign that gives positive t.\n\nCompute approximate values:\n\n\u221a15\u22483.872,\n\n\u221a105\u224810.246,\n\nThus,\n\n14\u221a15\u224814*3.872\u224854.208,\n\n8\u221a105\u22488*10.246\u224881.968,\n\nThus,\n\n[54.208 +81.968]/90\u2248136.176/90\u22481.513,\n\n[54.208-81.968]/90\u2248-27.76/90\u2248-0.308\n\nTake positive solution t\u22481.513.\n\nThus cot theta\u22481.513 \u21d2 tan theta\u22481/1.513\u22480.661.\n\nSo theta\u2248arctan(0.661)\u224833.4 degrees.\n\nNow, we need to relate this back to areas.\n\nRecall that [ABP] = (1/2)*AB*BP*sin(theta)=3*BP*sin(theta),\n\nand [ACP]= (1/2)*AC*CP*sin(theta)=4*CP*sin(theta).\n\nGiven BP/PC=1/2 \u21d2 CP=2BP \u21d2 [ACP]=4*(2BP)*sin(theta)=8 BP sin(theta).\n\nThus [ABP]/[ACP]=3/8, as before.\n\nLet me denote BP =x, so CP=2x.\n\nThe total area [ABC]=21\u221a15/4\u224820.328.\n\nWe need to find [BPC]. Let me see if we can express [BPC] in terms of x.\n\nNote that the area of triangle BPC can be expressed as (1/2)*BP*CP*sin(angle BPC).\n\nBut angle BPC is supplementary to angle APB and APC, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using the Law of Sines in triangle BPC:\n\nBut perhaps better to use coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the areas:\n\nThe total area [ABC]=[ABP]+[BPC]+[APC].\n\nLet me denote [ABP]=3k, [ACP]=8k, so total is 11k + [BPC]=[ABC].\n\nSo [BPC]= [ABC]-11k.\n\nBut I need to find k.\n\nAlternatively, using the ratio BP/PC=1/2 and the angle condition, perhaps express k in terms of the sides.\n\nAlternatively, consider Stewart's theorem on triangle ABC with cevian AP.\n\nWait, but we have two cevians BP and CP with a given ratio and angle condition.\n\nAlternatively, consider the areas:\n\nThe ratio of areas [ABP]/[ACP]=3/8, so 3k/8k=3/8.\n\nThe total area [ABC]= (3k +8k) + [BPC] =11k + [BPC].\n\nIf I can find another relation involving k and [BPC].\n\nAlternatively, consider the line AP and the ratios it creates.\n\nAlternatively, using mass point with the areas.\n\nWait, in mass point, if we consider the masses at B and C such that BP/PC=1/2, masses at B and C would be 2 and1 respectively. Thus mass at P is 3.\n\nThe mass at A is unknown. The masses must also satisfy the angle condition.\n\nAlternatively, the masses at A,B,C are m_A, m_B=2, m_C=1.\n\nThe coordinates of P in mass point would be (m_A A +2B +C)/(m_A+3).\n\nBut not sure how to relate to the angle condition.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of areas involving angle ABP and ACP.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem might have a elegant solution using Ceva and areas.\n\nGiven angle ABP = angle ACP, and BP/PC=1/2.\n\nLet me consider using the trigonometric Ceva equation which we had earlier:\n\n[sin(angle BAP)/sin(angle CAP)] * [sin(angle ABP)/sin(angle CBP)] * [sin(angle ACP)/sin(angle BCP)] =1.\n\nWe know angle ABP = angle ACP = theta,\n\nangle CBP = beta - theta,\n\nangle BCP = gamma - theta,\n\nand angle BAP + angle CAP = alpha.\n\nLet me denote angle BAP = phi, angle CAP = alpha - phi.\n\nThus,\n\n[sin(phi)/sin(alpha - phi)] * [sin(theta)/sin(beta - theta)] * [sin(theta)/sin(gamma - theta)] =1.\n\nAlso from earlier, from BP/PC=1/2 and mass point, or using the area ratio [ABP]/[ACP]=3/8,\n\nwhich can be related to the ratio of BP/PC and the sine of angles.\n\nAlternatively, from the area ratio:\n\n[ABP]/[ACP] = (AB * BP * sin(theta))/(AC * CP * sin(theta)) = (AB/BP)/(AC/CP) * (BP/CP),\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, [ABP] = (1/2)*AB*BP*sin(theta),\n\n[ACP] = (1/2)*AC*CP*sin(theta).\n\nThus, their ratio is (AB * BP)/(AC * CP) = (6 * BP)/(8 * CP)= (6/8)*(BP/CP)= (3/4)*(1/2)= 3/8,\n\nWhich matches the given ratio. So this is consistent.\n\nThus, this doesn't give new information.\n\nBack to trigonometric Ceva equation:\n\n[sin(phi)/sin(alpha - phi)] * [sin\u00b2(theta)/(sin(beta - theta) sin(gamma - theta))] =1.\n\nBut we also had earlier:\n\nFrom the angle condition's equation:\n\nsin\u00b2(theta) =2 sin(beta - theta) sin(gamma - theta),\n\nThus,\n\nsin\u00b2(theta)/(sin(beta - theta) sin(gamma - theta))=2.\n\nSubstituting into Ceva equation:\n\n[sin(phi)/sin(alpha - phi)] *2 =1 \u21d2 sin(phi)/sin(alpha - phi)=1/2.\n\nThus,\n\nsin(phi)= (1/2) sin(alpha - phi).\n\nUsing sine of difference:\n\nsin(alpha - phi)=sin alpha cos phi - cos alpha sin phi.\n\nThus,\n\nsin phi = (1/2)( sin alpha cos phi - cos alpha sin phi )\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nsin phi + (1/2) cos alpha sin phi = (1/2) sin alpha cos phi\n\nFactor sin phi:\n\nsin phi [1 + (1/2) cos alpha ] = (1/2) sin alpha cos phi\n\nDivide both sides by cos phi:\n\nsin phi / cos phi [1 + (1/2) cos alpha ] = (1/2) sin alpha\n\nThus,\n\ntan phi [1 + (1/2) cos alpha ] = (1/2) sin alpha\n\nSolve for tan phi:\n\ntan phi = [ (1/2) sin alpha ] / [1 + (1/2) cos alpha ]\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 2:\n\ntan phi = sin alpha / [2 + cos alpha ]\n\nNow, we can compute this using known values.\n\nWe have:\n\nsin alpha =7\u221a15/32,\n\ncos alpha=17/32,\n\nThus,\n\ntan phi = (7\u221a15/32) / [2 +17/32] = (7\u221a15/32) / ( (64+17)/32 ) =7\u221a15 /81\n\nThus,\n\ntan phi=7\u221a15/81 \u21d2 phi=arctan(7\u221a15/81).\n\nNow, with phi known, we can find the ratio [APB]/[APC] using the sine formula.\n\nThe ratio [APB]/[APC]= (AB * sin(phi))/(AC * sin(alpha - phi)).\n\nSince [APB] = (1/2)*AB*AP*sin(angle ABP) but wait, perhaps better:\n\nWait, using the formula:\n\n[APB]/[APC] = (AB * BP * sin(angle APB)) / (AC * CP * sin(angle APC)),\n\nBut maybe better to use areas related to angle at A.\n\nAlternatively, using the ratio:\n\n[APB]/[APC] = (AB/AP * BP/CP * sin(angle ABP)/sin(angle ACP)) but since angle ABP = angle ACP,\n\nThus,\n\n[APB]/[APC] = (AB/AC)*(BP/CP)= (6/8)*(1/2)= (3/4)*(1/2)=3/8,\n\nWait, but this is similar to previous ratios.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio [APB]/[APC]= [AB * sin(phi)]/[AC * sin(alpha - phi)].\n\nUsing the sine law in triangle APB and APC.\n\nIn triangle APB and APC sharing side AP.\n\nThus,\n\n[APB]/[APC] = (AB * sin(phi))/(AC * sin(angle APC)),\n\nBut angle APC is supplementary to angle ACP? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using Law of Sines in triangles APB and APC:\n\nIn triangle APB: AP/sin(angle ABP)= BP/sin(angle BAP)=AB/sin(angle APB)\n\nIn triangle APC: AP/sin(angle ACP)=CP/sin(angle CAP)=AC/sin(angle APC)\n\nSince angle ABP=angle ACP=theta,\n\nAP/sin(theta)= BP/sin(phi)=AB/sin(angle APB),\n\nAP/sin(theta)= CP/sin(angle CAP)=AC/sin(angle APC).\n\nThus,\n\nBP/sin(phi)= CP/sin(angle CAP),\n\nBut angle CAP= alpha - phi,\n\nSo,\n\nBP/CP = sin(phi)/sin(alpha - phi)= (sin phi)/(sin(alpha - phi)),\n\nWhich from earlier is 1/2.\n\nWhich matches BP/CP=1/2.\n\nThus, not new info.\n\nBack to the ratio [APB]/[APC]:\n\n[APB]/[APC]= (AB * BP * sin(theta)) / (AC * CP * sin(theta)) = (AB/AC)*(BP/CP)= (6/8)*(1/2)=3/8.\n\nThus, [APB]/[APC]=3/8.\n\nBut that's the same as [ABP]/[ACP].\n\nWait, no, APB is the same as ABP, and APC is the same as ACP.

Because when I computed with m=5, I assumed masses at A=5,B=2,C=1, then computed coordinates accordingly. But when I computed the area with those coordinates, I got [BPC]=5/8 of [ABC], but when I did the numerical calculation earlier with m=5 (mass at A=5), I found coordinates x\u22482.03, y\u22480.726, and computed area [BPC]\u22487.894 when total area\u224820.328 gives ratio ~0.388, but according to the shoelace formula with exact fractions, it's 5/8=0.625.\n\nThere's a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, let me recheck the shoelace calculation with the exact fractions:\n\n[BPC]=210\u221a15/64,\n\n[ABC]=21\u221a15/4= (21*16\u221a15)/64= 336\u221a15/64,\n\nThus the ratio is (210\u221a15/64)/(336\u221a15/64)=210/336=5/8.\n\nSo the exact calculation gives 5/8. But why did the approximate with m=5 give 0.388?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the approximate area with coordinates:\n\nWith P(65/32\u22482.031, 7\u221a15/32\u22480.726),\n\nB(6,0), C(4.25,6.777).\n\nCompute area using shoelace:\n\nList the points:\n\nB(6,0), P(2.031,0.726), C(4.25,6.777), back to B(6,0).\n\nCompute terms:\n\nSum1:\n\n6*0.726 +2.031*6.777 +4.25*0 \u22484.356 +13.774 +0\u224818.13,\n\nSum2:\n\n0*2.031 +0.726*4.25 +6.777*6\u22480 +3.088 +40.662\u224843.75,\n\nArea=0.5|18.13-43.75|=0.5*25.62\u224812.81,\n\nTotal area is\u224820.328,\n\nThus ratio\u224812.81/20.328\u22480.63, which is close to 5/8=0.625. So my earlier approximate calculation was wrong because I used different coordinates.\n\nThus, the correct ratio is5/8=0.625.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that P is inside the triangle, and with mass at A=5,B=2,C=1, the coordinates of P are (65/32\u22482.03,0.726), which is inside the triangle.\n\nThus the correct answer is5/8.\n\nBut why did my first approximate calculation with different coordinates (x\u22483.378,y\u22481.131) give a different result? Because I didn't use the mass point method which enforces the angle condition.\n\nThus, the mass point approach with m=5 gives the correct ratio of5/8.\n\nBut the problem states angle ABP = angle ACP, and with masses set to satisfy the ratio BP/PC=1/2, and mass at A=5, the angle condition is satisfied (as checked with m=5 giving equal angles\u224810.4 degrees), so this must be correct.\n\nThus the answer is5/8.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for [BPC]/[ABC], and according to mass point it's5/8.\n\nBut the problem's given data includes AB=6, AC=8, BC=7, which in my coordinate system, the area of ABC is21\u221a15/4\u224820.328,\n\nand with the computed [BPC]=5/8 of that.\n\nBut let me check with another approach.\n\nUsing mass point, masses at A=5,B=2,C=1,\n\nthen the area ratios:\n\nThe mass at P is5+2+1=8.\n\nThe area [BPC] is proportional to the mass at A=5,\n\nWait, in mass point geometry, the areas are proportional to the masses?\n\nWait, no, in barycentric coordinates, the coordinates are (m_A, m_B, m_C)/(total mass). Thus the coordinates of P are(5,2,1)/8,\n\nThus [BPC] corresponds to the mass at A, which is5/8,\n\nYes! Exactly. In barycentric coordinates, the weights are (u,v,w)=(5/8,2/8,1/8),\n\nThus [BPC]=u=5/8.\n\nTherefore the answer is5/8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with \\( AB = 6 \\), \\( AC = 8 \\), and \\( BC = 7 \\), and point \\( P \\) inside such that \\( \\angle ABP = \\angle ACP \\) and \\( \\frac{BP}{PC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\), we need to find the ratio \\( \\frac{[BPC]}{[ABC]} \\).\n\n1. **Coordinate Setup and Barycentric Coordinates**:\n   - Placed \\( A \\) at the origin, \\( B \\) at \\( (6, 0) \\), and \\( C \\) at \\( \\left( \\frac{17}{4}, \\frac{7\\sqrt{15}}{4} \\right) \\).\n   - Using barycentric coordinates with masses \\( m_A = 5 \\), \\( m_B = 2 \\), and \\( m_C = 1 \\) to satisfy the ratio \\( \\frac{BP}{PC} = \\frac{1}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Mass Point Geometry**:\n   - The coordinates of \\( P \\) in barycentric coordinates are \\( \\left( \\frac{m_A}{m_A + m_B + m_C}, \\frac{m_B}{m_A + m_B + m_C}, \\frac{m_C}{m_A + m_B + m_C} \\right) \\).\n   - This gives \\( P \\) as \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{8",

Also, the ratio of BP to PC is 1:2. The question is to find the ratio of the area of triangle BPC to the area of triangle ABC.\n\nHmm. Since it's a ratio of areas, maybe I can use area ratios based on some known ratios of sides or heights? Also, the angle condition might be useful here. Let me think about the given angle equality. \n\nFirst, perhaps I can use trigonometric relationships here. Since angles at B and C are related, maybe I can set up some trigonometric equations. Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in some triangles?\n\nAlternatively, since there is a ratio of BP to PC given, perhaps mass point geometry could be useful? Or coordinate geometry? Since the problem is asking for an area ratio, coordinate geometry might be straightforward if I can assign coordinates to the points and compute the areas directly. Let me consider that approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using Ceva's theorem? Since there is a point inside the triangle with certain ratios. Let me recall Ceva's theorem: for concurrent cevians, the product of the ratios is 1. But here, the given ratio is BP/PC = 1/2, so that might be part of Ceva's condition. However, we also have the angle condition. Let me see.\n\nWait, Ceva's theorem requires three cevians to be concurrent, but here we have only two angles given equal. Maybe I need to combine Ceva with the angle condition?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Angle Bisector Theorem? But the angles at B and C are equal, but not sure if they bisect anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place point A at the origin, point B somewhere on the x-axis, and point C somewhere in the plane.\n\nLet me set coordinates:\n\nLet me set point A at (0,0). Let me let AB lie along the x-axis, so point B is at (6, 0). Point C is somewhere in the plane. Since AC is 8 and BC is 7, I can find coordinates of point C.\n\nWait, coordinates might be a good approach here. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nLet me assign coordinates:\n\n- Let\u2019s place point A at (0,0).\n\n- Let\u2019s place point B at (6,0) since AB=6.\n\n- Now, point C is somewhere such that AC=8 and BC=7.\n\nWe can find coordinates of point C by using the distance formulas. Let me denote coordinates of C as (x,y).\n\nThen, the distance from A to C is 8, so:\n\n\\( x^2 + y^2 = 8^2 = 64 \\).\n\nThe distance from B to C is 7, so:\n\n\\( (x - 6)^2 + y^2 = 7^2 = 49 \\).\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n\\( (x - 6)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 49 - 64 \\)\n\nExpanding:\n\n\\( x\u00b2 -12x +36 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -15 \\)\n\nSimplify:\n\n-12x +36 = -15 \u2192 -12x = -51 \u2192 x = 51/12 = 17/4 = 4.25.\n\nSo x is 17/4. Then, substituting back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 64:\n\n(17/4)^2 + y\u00b2 = 64 \u2192 (289/16) + y\u00b2 = 64 \u2192 y\u00b2 = 64 - 289/16 = (1024/16 - 289/16) = 735/16 \u2192 y = sqrt(735)/4. Let me compute sqrt(735). 735 factors: 49*15 = 49*3*5, so sqrt(49*15)=7*sqrt(15). So y = 7\u221a15 /4.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of C are (17/4, (7\u221a15)/4).\n\nAlright, so coordinates:\n\nA: (0, 0)\n\nB: (6, 0)\n\nC: (17/4, (7\u221a15)/4 )\n\nNow, point P is inside the triangle such that angle ABP = angle ACP, and BP/PC = 1/2.\n\nHmm, so angle ABP = angle ACP. Let me denote angle ABP = angle ACP = \u03b8.\n\nWe need to find coordinates of P such that this angle condition holds and BP/PC = 1/2.\n\nThis might be a bit tricky, but perhaps we can set variables for coordinates of P and use the given conditions.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of P as (p, q). Since BP/PC = 1/2, the ratio along BC? Wait, no. BP/PC is the ratio of lengths BP to PC, but P is inside the triangle, so perhaps it's a ratio along some line?\n\nWait, the ratio BP/PC = 1/2. Since P is inside the triangle, perhaps this ratio is along segment BC? Wait, but P is inside the triangle, so maybe it's along another line?\n\nWait, maybe BP/PC is the ratio of the lengths from B to P and from P to C along some path? Hmm, actually, the problem states it as BP/PC = 1/2, so it's the ratio of the lengths of BP to PC. So BP : PC = 1:2. So the point P divides the segment BC in the ratio BP:PC = 1:2? Wait, but is P lying on BC?\n\nWait, but the problem says P is inside triangle ABC. If P were on BC, then it would divide BC into BP:PC =1:2. However, the problem also states that angles ABP and ACP are equal. If P is on BC, then angle ABP is the angle at B between BA and BP, and angle ACP is the angle at C between CA and CP. Are those angles necessarily equal if P is on BC? Probably not unless some specific condition holds. So perhaps P is not on BC. Therefore, the ratio BP/PC =1/2 is not along BC but in terms of lengths from B and C to point P.\n\nTherefore, P is some point inside the triangle such that BP : PC =1:2 in terms of the distances from P to B and to C. So, BP / PC = 1/2 \u21d2 BP = (1/2) PC \u21d2 2 BP = PC.\n\nHmm, okay. So, given that, perhaps we can use coordinates to set up equations for P. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of P as (p, q). Then, the distance from P to B is BP = sqrt[(p - 6)^2 + (q - 0)^2], and distance from P to C is PC = sqrt[(p - 17/4)^2 + (q - (7\u221a15)/4)^2]. The ratio BP/PC =1/2, so:\n\nsqrt[(p -6)^2 + q^2] / sqrt[(p - 17/4)^2 + (q - (7\u221a15)/4)^2] = 1/2.\n\nSquaring both sides:\n\n[(p -6)^2 + q^2] / [(p -17/4)^2 + (q - (7\u221a15)/4)^2] = 1/4.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n4[(p -6)^2 + q^2] = [(p -17/4)^2 + (q - (7\u221a15)/4)^2].\n\nThis is one equation involving variables p and q. \n\nAdditionally, the angle condition: angle ABP = angle ACP. Let me see how to express that. \n\nAngle ABP is the angle at point B between BA and BP. Similarly, angle ACP is the angle at point C between CA and CP. \n\nHmm, angles at different points. To express that these angles are equal, perhaps using vectors or slopes?\n\nAlternatively, using the tangent of the angles, or the sine/cosine laws?\n\nAlternatively, using coordinates, maybe we can compute the slopes of BP and BA, then find the angle between them, and similarly for CP and CA. \n\nLet me think. Let me denote vectors:\n\nAt point B, the vectors BA and BP. BA is from B to A, so vector BA is A - B = (-6, 0). BP is from B to P: (p -6, q -0) = (p-6, q).\n\nSimilarly, at point C, the vectors CA and CP. CA is from C to A: A - C = (-17/4, - (7\u221a15)/4). CP is from C to P: (p -17/4, q - (7\u221a15)/4).\n\nThe angle between BA and BP at point B is equal to the angle between CA and CP at point C. \n\nThe angle between two vectors can be found via the dot product formula:\n\ncos\u03b8 = (v \u00b7 w)/(|v||w|)\n\nTherefore, the cosine of angle ABP (angle at B between BA and BP) is equal to the cosine of angle ACP (angle at C between CA and CP). Since the angles are equal, their cosines are equal.\n\nThus,\n\n[ (BA \u00b7 BP) / (|BA| |BP|) ) ] = [ (CA \u00b7 CP) / (|CA| |CP|) ) ]\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute vectors:\n\nBA vector: from B to A is (-6, 0).\n\nBP vector: (p -6, q).\n\nDot product BA \u00b7 BP = (-6)(p -6) + 0*q = -6(p -6).\n\n|BA| = sqrt( (-6)^2 + 0^2 ) = 6.\n\n|BP| = sqrt( (p -6)^2 + q^2 ).\n\nSimilarly, vectors for angle at C:\n\nCA vector: from C to A is (-17/4, - (7\u221a15)/4).\n\nCP vector: from C to P is (p -17/4, q - (7\u221a15)/4).\n\nDot product CA \u00b7 CP = [ -17/4 (p -17/4) ] + [ - (7\u221a15)/4 ( q - (7\u221a15)/4 ) ]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term: -17/4 (p - 17/4) = -17/4 p + (17/4)^2\n\nSecond term: - (7\u221a15)/4 * q + (7\u221a15)/4 * (7\u221a15)/4 = - (7\u221a15)/4 q + (49 * 15)/16\n\nSo combining terms:\n\nCA \u00b7 CP = - (17/4)p + (289)/16 - (7\u221a15 /4) q + (735)/16\n\nBecause 49*15 = 735, and divided by 16.\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nWait, (7\u221a15)^2 is 49*15, so yes, that term is (7\u221a15)^2 / 16 ?\n\nWait, actually, the second term is:\n\n- (7\u221a15)/4 * q + (7\u221a15)/4 * (7\u221a15)/4. So the second part is:\n\n(7\u221a15 /4)*(7\u221a15 /4) = (7^2)*(\u221a15)^2 / (4*4) = (49*15)/16 = 735/16. Correct.\n\nSo, CA \u00b7 CP = - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15 /4) q + (289 + 735)/16\n\nWait, 289 + 735 = 1024? 289 + 700 is 989, so 289 + 735 = 1024? 735-289? Wait, no, 289 + 735:\n\n200 + 700 = 900, 89 + 35 = 124, so total 1024. Yes, 289 + 735 = 1024. So 1024/16 = 64. Wait, so:\n\nCA \u00b7 CP = - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15 /4) q + 64.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nThe magnitude |CA| is the length of CA, which is given as 8, right? Wait, AC =8, so yes, |CA| = AC =8.\n\n|CP| is the distance from C to P, which is sqrt[(p -17/4)^2 + (q - (7\u221a15)/4)^2].\n\nPutting all together, the equation from the angle equality is:\n\n[ (-6(p -6)) / (6 * |BP|) ] = [ ( - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15 /4) q + 64 ) / (8 * |CP|) ) ]\n\nSimplify numerator and denominators.\n\nLeft side numerator: -6(p -6)\n\nDenominator: 6 * |BP| \u2192 cancels with -6 to give - (p -6)/|BP|\n\nRight side numerator: [ - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15 /4) q + 64 ]\n\nDenominator: 8 * |CP|\n\nThus equation:\n\n- (p -6)/|BP| = [ ( - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15 /4) q + 64 ) ] / (8 |CP| )\n\nHmm, this looks complicated, but maybe we can use the earlier equation from the ratio BP/PC =1/2. Since BP / PC =1/2, so 2 BP = PC. Therefore, |BP| = (1/2)|PC|. So we can substitute |BP| = (1/2)|CP| into this equation.\n\nLet me do that substitution.\n\nSo replace |BP| with (1/2)|CP| in the left side denominator:\n\nLeft side becomes: - (p -6)/( (1/2)|CP| ) = -2(p -6)/|CP|\n\nSo now the equation is:\n\n-2(p -6)/|CP| = [ - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15 /4) q + 64 ] / (8 |CP| )\n\nMultiply both sides by |CP| to eliminate denominators:\n\n-2(p -6) = [ - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15 /4) q + 64 ] /8\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominator on the right:\n\n-16(p -6) = - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15)/4 q + 64\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-64(p -6) = -17p -7\u221a15 q + 256\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\n-64p + 384 = -17p -7\u221a15 q + 256\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n-64p + 384 +17p +7\u221a15 q -256 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-64p +17p) + 7\u221a15 q + (384 -256) =0\n\n-47p +7\u221a15 q +128 =0\n\nHmm, so that gives an equation: -47p +7\u221a15 q = -128 \u2192 47p -7\u221a15 q = 128.\n\nSo that's one equation from the angle condition, combined with BP/PC=1/2.\n\nEarlier, from BP/PC=1/2, we had another equation: 4[(p -6)^2 + q^2] = [(p -17/4)^2 + (q - (7\u221a15)/4)^2].\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\nEquation (1): 4[(p -6)^2 + q^2] = [(p -17/4)^2 + (q - (7\u221a15)/4)^2]\n\nEquation (2): 47p -7\u221a15 q =128\n\nSo now, we can solve these two equations for p and q. Let me first work on equation (1) to simplify it.\n\nExpand both sides:\n\nLeft side: 4[(p -6)^2 + q^2] =4(p\u00b2 -12p +36 + q\u00b2) =4p\u00b2 -48p +144 +4q\u00b2\n\nRight side: [(p -17/4)^2 + (q - (7\u221a15)/4)^2] \n\nExpand (p -17/4)^2 = p\u00b2 - (34/4)p + (289)/16 = p\u00b2 - (17/2)p +289/16\n\nSimilarly, (q - (7\u221a15)/4)^2 = q\u00b2 - (7\u221a15)/2 q + (49*15)/16 = q\u00b2 - (7\u221a15)/2 q + 735/16\n\nTherefore, adding them together:\n\np\u00b2 - (17/2)p +289/16 + q\u00b2 - (7\u221a15)/2 q +735/16 \n\nCombine terms:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - (17/2)p - (7\u221a15)/2 q + (289 +735)/16\n\n289+735=1024, so 1024/16=64. Therefore, right side simplifies to:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - (17/2)p - (7\u221a15)/2 q +64\n\nThus, equation (1):\n\nLeft side: 4p\u00b2 -48p +144 +4q\u00b2 = Right side: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 - (17/2)p - (7\u221a15)/2 q +64\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\n4p\u00b2 -48p +144 +4q\u00b2 - p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 + (17/2)p + (7\u221a15)/2 q -64 =0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(4p\u00b2 - p\u00b2) + (4q\u00b2 - q\u00b2) + (-48p + (17/2)p) + ( (7\u221a15)/2 q ) + (144 -64)=0\n\nWhich is:\n\n3p\u00b2 +3q\u00b2 + (-48p +8.5p) + ( (7\u221a15)/2 q ) +80 =0\n\nCalculating coefficients:\n\n-48p +8.5p = (-48 + 8.5)p = (-39.5)p = -79/2 p\n\nSo:\n\n3p\u00b2 +3q\u00b2 - (79/2)p + (7\u221a15 /2 ) q +80 =0.\n\nHmm, this is still a bit messy. Let me see if I can write equation (1) as:\n\n3p\u00b2 +3q\u00b2 - (79/2)p + (7\u221a15 /2 ) q +80 =0.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n6p\u00b2 +6q\u00b2 -79p +7\u221a15 q +160 =0.\n\nSo equation (1a): 6p\u00b2 +6q\u00b2 -79p +7\u221a15 q +160 =0.\n\nEquation (2):47p -7\u221a15 q =128.\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can solve equation (2) for one variable and substitute into equation (1a).\n\nLet me solve equation (2) for q:\n\n47p -7\u221a15 q =128 \u21d2 -7\u221a15 q =128 -47p \u21d2 q = (47p -128)/(7\u221a15).\n\nSo q = (47p -128)/(7\u221a15).\n\nNow, substitute this into equation (1a):\n\n6p\u00b2 +6q\u00b2 -79p +7\u221a15 q +160 =0.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, compute q squared:\n\nq\u00b2 = [ (47p -128)^2 ] / ( (7\u221a15)^2 ) = (47p -128)^2 / (49*15) = (47p -128)^2 / 735.\n\nSimilarly, 7\u221a15 q =7\u221a15 * (47p -128)/(7\u221a15) ) = (47p -128).\n\nTherefore, substituting into equation (1a):\n\n6p\u00b2 +6*( (47p -128)^2 /735 ) -79p + (47p -128) +160 =0.\n\nLet me compute term by term.\n\nFirst term: 6p\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: 6*( (47p -128)^2 ) /735 = (6/735)*(47p -128)^2 = (2/245)*(47p -128)^2.\n\nThird term: -79p.\n\nFourth term: (47p -128).\n\nFifth term: +160.\n\nSo combining terms:\n\n6p\u00b2 + [2/(245)](47p -128)^2 -79p +47p -128 +160 =0.\n\nSimplify the linear terms:\n\n-79p +47p = -32p.\n\n-128 +160 = +32.\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n6p\u00b2 + [2/(245)](47p -128)^2 -32p +32 =0.\n\nHmm, this is going to be a quadratic in p, but looks quite complicated. Let me see if I can compute (47p -128)^2 first.\n\nLet me expand (47p -128)^2:\n\n= (47p)^2 - 2*47p*128 +128^2\n\n= 2209p\u00b2 - 12224p + 16384.\n\nTherefore, substituting back into the equation:\n\n6p\u00b2 + [2/(245)]*(2209p\u00b2 -12224p +16384) -32p +32 =0.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 6p\u00b2.\n\nSecond term:\n\n2/245*(2209p\u00b2) = (4418/245)p\u00b2,\n\n2/245*(-12224p) = (-24448/245)p,\n\n2/245*(16384) = (32768)/245.\n\nThird term: -32p,\n\nFourth term: +32.\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\n6p\u00b2 + (4418/245)p\u00b2 - (24448/245)p + (32768)/245 -32p +32 =0.\n\nLet me convert all terms to have denominator 245 to combine them:\n\nFirst term: 6p\u00b2 = (6*245)/245 p\u00b2 = 1470/245 p\u00b2,\n\nSecond term: 4418/245 p\u00b2,\n\nThird term: -24448/245 p,\n\nFourth term: 32768/245,\n\nFifth term: -32p = (-32*245)/245 p = -7840/245 p,\n\nSixth term: +32 = (32*245)/245 = 7840/245.\n\nSo putting all together:\n\n[1470/245 +4418/245] p\u00b2 + [ -24448/245 -7840/245 ] p + [32768/245 +7840/245] =0\n\nCompute each bracket:\n\nFor p\u00b2 terms: (1470 +4418)/245 = 5888/245,\n\np terms: (-24448 -7840)/245 = (-32288)/245,\n\nconstant terms: (32768 +7840)/245 =40608/245,\n\nTherefore equation:\n\n(5888/245)p\u00b2 - (32288/245)p + (40608/245) =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 245 to eliminate denominators:\n\n5888 p\u00b2 -32288 p +40608 =0.\n\nHmm, now we have a quadratic equation in p. Let me see if I can simplify this equation by dividing by common factors.\n\nLooking at coefficients:\n\n5888, 32288, 40608.\n\nLet me check if they are divisible by 16:\n\n5888 \u00f716= 368,\n\n32288 \u00f716= 2018,\n\nWait, 32288 divided by 16: 16*2000=32000, so 32288-32000=288, 288/16=18, so total 2018.\n\n40608 \u00f716= 2538.\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n368 p\u00b2 -2018 p +2538 =0.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nWait, 5888 \u00f716: 5888/16: 5888 \u00f72=2944, \u00f72=1472, \u00f72=736, \u00f72=368. Yes.\n\nSimilarly, 32288 \u00f716: 32288/2=16144, /2=8072, /2=4036, /2=2018.\n\n40608 \u00f716: 40608 /2=20304 /2=10152 /2=5076 /2=2538. Correct.\n\nSo equation: 368p\u00b2 -2018p +2538 =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps further simplification? Let me check GCD of 368,2018,2538.\n\nLet me see factors of 368: 8*46=8*(2*23)=2^4 *23.\n\n2018: 2018 \u00f72=1009, which is a prime number (I think). Let me check 1009 divided by primes up to sqrt(1009)\u224831.7. 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31. 1009 divided by 13: 13*77=1001, 1009-1001=8, so not. 17*59=1003, 1009-1003=6. Not divisible. 19*53=1007, 1009-1007=2. Not divisible. 23*43=989, 23*44=1012. So yes, 1009 is prime. So 2018=2\u00d71009.\n\n2538: 2538 \u00f72=1269. 1269 \u00f73=423, \u00f73=141, \u00f73=47. So 2538=2\u00d73^3\u00d747.\n\nSo common factor between coefficients: 368=2^4\u00d723, 2018=2\u00d71009, 2538=2\u00d73\u00b3\u00d747. The common factor is 2. So let's divide by 2:\n\n184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 =0.\n\nHmm, coefficients now are 184, 1009, 1269. Let me check if they have any common factors. 184 and 1009:\n\nGCD(184,1009). 1009 \u00f7184=5\u00d7184=920, remainder 89. Then GCD(184,89). 184 \u00f789=2\u00d789=178, remainder 6. GCD(89,6). 89 \u00f76=14\u00d76=84, rem 5. GCD(6,5)=1. So GCD(184,1009)=1. Similarly, 1009 and 1269. 1269-1009=260. GCD(1009,260). 1009 \u00f7260=3\u00d7260=780, rem 229. GCD(260,229). 260-229=31. GCD(229,31). 229 \u00f731=7\u00d731=217, rem 12. GCD(31,12). 31-2\u00d712=7. GCD(12,7)=1. So GCD is 1. Therefore, the equation is simplified as 184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 =0. So we can try solving this quadratic equation.\n\nLet me use the quadratic formula:\n\np = [1009 \u00b1 sqrt(1009\u00b2 -4\u00d7184\u00d71269)] / (2\u00d7184).\n\nFirst compute discriminant D = 1009\u00b2 -4\u00d7184\u00d71269.\n\nCalculate 1009\u00b2: 1000\u00b2 + 2\u00d71000\u00d79 +9\u00b2 = 1,000,000 + 18,000 +81=1,018,081.\n\n4\u00d7184\u00d71269: first compute 4\u00d7184=736. Then 736\u00d71269.\n\nLet me compute 736\u00d71269:\n\nBreakdown: 700\u00d71269 = 888,300,\n\n36\u00d71269 = let's compute 30\u00d71269=38,070 and 6\u00d71269=7,614. So total 38,070 +7,614 =45,684.\n\nSo total 888,300 +45,684 =933,984.\n\nTherefore, 4\u00d7184\u00d71269 =933,984.\n\nThus D =1,018,081 -933,984 =84,097.\n\nHmm, sqrt(84,097). Let me see:\n\nCalculate 290\u00b2=84,100. Oh! So sqrt(84,097)=sqrt(290\u00b2 -3)=sqrt(84100 -3)= which is approximately 290 - something, but exact value?\n\nWait, since 290\u00b2 is 84100, then 290\u00b2 -3 =84097. So sqrt(84097)=sqrt(290\u00b2 -3). That's irrational. Hmm, so maybe I made a miscalculation?\n\nWait, let me check the discriminant again.\n\nWait, D =1009^2 -4\u00d7184\u00d71269.\n\n1009^2 is 1,018,081.\n\n4\u00d7184\u00d71269:\n\nFirst compute 184\u00d71269:\n\nLet me compute 184\u00d71200=220,800; 184\u00d769=12,696. So total 220,800 +12,696 =233,496. Then \u00d74 =933,984. Correct.\n\nSo D=1,018,081 -933,984 =84,097. Hmm. So sqrt(84097). Hmm, is this a perfect square?\n\nWait, 290\u00b2 =84100, so 290\u00b2 is 84100, so sqrt(84097) is just a bit less than 290, but not a whole number. Hmm, so that's a problem because if the discriminant is not a perfect square, then this quadratic might not have rational solutions. Which would complicate things, but perhaps we can proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in expanding the equations? Let me check my steps again.\n\nLet me retrace steps:\n\nFirst, when I calculated equation (1):\n\nAfter expanding both sides and moving everything to the left, I arrived at:\n\n3p\u00b2 +3q\u00b2 - (79/2)p + (7\u221a15 /2 ) q +80 =0.\n\nThen multiplied by 2 to get: 6p\u00b2 +6q\u00b2 -79p +7\u221a15 q +160 =0. That seems okay.\n\nEquation (2): 47p -7\u221a15 q =128 \u2192 solved for q: q=(47p -128)/(7\u221a15). That seems okay.\n\nSubstituting into equation (1a) led to the quadratic equation in p. Let me check substitution again.\n\nWait, when I substituted q into 6q\u00b2 term:\n\nq\u00b2 is [(47p -128)^2]/(7\u221a15)^2 = (47p-128)^2/(49\u00d715). So 6q\u00b2 would be 6*(47p-128)^2/(735). 6 divided by 735 is 6/(735)=2/245. So that's correct.\n\nThen 7\u221a15 q = 7\u221a15*(47p -128)/(7\u221a15)= (47p -128). Correct.\n\nSo the substitution steps seem okay.\n\nHmm, so the quadratic equation in p is correct, but it's a bit messy. Since this is getting too algebra intensive, maybe there's another approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using mass point or area ratios with the given angle condition?\n\nWait, another idea: Since the ratio BP/PC =1/2, perhaps using the concept of weighted points or barycentric coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, since angles at B and C are equal, maybe reflecting point P over the angle bisector or something?\n\nAlternatively, using trigonometric Ceva's theorem?\n\nWait, Ceva's theorem in trigonometric form states that for concurrent cevians, (sin\u2220ABP / sin\u2220CBP) * (sin\u2220BCP / sin\u2220ACP) * (sin\u2220CAP / sin\u2220BAP) )=1.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the cevians are concurrent here, but since we have angle conditions, maybe this is applicable?\n\nWait, let me think. Let me try to apply trigonometric Ceva's theorem.\n\nAssuming that the cevians from A, B, C are AP, BP, CP respectively. For their concurrency, the trigonometric Ceva condition must hold. However, since P is inside the triangle, maybe the cevians are concurrent? Not sure, but maybe the given angle condition can be incorporated here.\n\nWait, the problem states angle ABP = angle ACP. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let angle ABP = angle ACP = \u03b8.\n\nLet me denote angle EBP as something? Hmm, perhaps labeling the angles.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote variables for the angles at each vertex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangles involving P.\n\nLet me consider triangles ABP and ACP.\n\nIn triangle ABP, angle at B is \u03b8, side AB=6, BP is a side.\n\nIn triangle ACP, angle at C is \u03b8, side AC=8, CP is a side.\n\nHmm, perhaps using the Law of Sines in these triangles.\n\nIn triangle ABP:\n\nAB / sin(angle APB) = BP / sin(angle BAP)\n\nWait, maybe better to consider angles at P?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in triangle ABP:\n\nLaw of Sines: AB / sin(angle APB) = BP / sin(angle BAP) = AP / sin(angle ABP).\n\nSimilarly, in triangle APC:\n\nAC / sin(angle APC) = CP / sin(angle CAP) = AP / sin(angle ACP).\n\nSince angle ABP = angle ACP = \u03b8, so sin(angle ABP) = sin(angle ACP).\n\nHmm, maybe this can be connected.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote angle BAP as \u03b1 and angle CAP as \u03b3. Since angle BAC is split into \u03b1 and \u03b3, so \u03b1 + \u03b3 = angle BAC.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle ABP, angle at B is \u03b8, angle at A is \u03b1, so angle at P is 180 - \u03b1 - \u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle APC, angle at C is \u03b8, angle at A is \u03b3, so angle at P is 180 - \u03b3 - \u03b8.\n\nWait, but these angles at P from the two triangles should be supplementary or something? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering triangle BPC. Wait, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since BP/PC = 1/2, so if we let BP = x, then PC =2x. Then BC is split into BP and PC in ratio 1:2, but wait, no, BP and PC are lengths from P to B and to C, not along BC. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates is still the way to go, even if it's tedious.\n\nLet me proceed with the quadratic equation.\n\nWe had the quadratic in p: 184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 =0.\n\nCompute discriminant D = (1009)^2 -4\u00d7184\u00d71269.\n\nWait, let me recompute the discriminant again carefully:\n\n1009\u00b2 is indeed 1,018,081.\n\n4\u00d7184\u00d71269: 4\u00d7184=736; 736\u00d71269.\n\nLet me compute 736\u00d71000=736,000; 736\u00d7200=147,200; 736\u00d769= ?\n\n736\u00d770=51,520 minus 736 is 51,520-736=50,784.\n\nThus 736\u00d71269 = 736\u00d7(1000+200+69)=736,000 +147,200 +50,784 = 736,000+147,200=883,200 +50,784=933,984. So 4\u00d7184\u00d71269=933,984.\n\nThus D=1,018,081 -933,984=84,097 as before.\n\nHmm, sqrt(84097). Let me see if 290\u00b2 is 84100, so sqrt(84097)=290 - sqrt(84100 -84097)=290 - sqrt(3), but irrational.\n\nHmm. Maybe approximate it? But since this is an exact problem, perhaps there's an error in my approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me double-check.\n\nStarting again, the angle condition: angle ABP = angle ACP. \n\nUsing vectors, I computed the cosine of those angles and set them equal. \n\nWait, but in the angle at B between BA and BP, and angle at C between CA and CP. The vectors BA is from B to A, and BP is from B to P. Similarly, vectors CA is from C to A, and CP is from C to P. \n\nTherefore, the angle between vectors BA and BP at B is equal to angle between vectors CA and CP at C. \n\nTherefore, the dot product formula was applied correctly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in expanding terms.\n\nLet me check equation (2):\n\nFrom the angle equality, after substitutions, we arrived at equation 47p -7\u221a15 q =128. Let me see if that's correct.\n\nWait, when I had the equation after multiplying out terms:\n\nAfter simplifying the equation from the angle condition, I had:\n\n-64(p -6) = -17p -7\u221a15 q +256\n\nWait, let me retrace that step again.\n\nWait, after expanding everything, the equation was:\n\nAfter moving all terms to the left:\n\n-64(p -6) = -17p -7\u221a15 q +256\n\nWait, let me confirm this step:\n\nEarlier steps:\n\nAfter expanding the equation from the angle equality:\n\nLeft side after multiplying by 4: -64(p -6)\n\nRight side after multiplying by 4: -17p -7\u221a15 q +256 ?\n\nWait, let me go back to the step before that.\n\nStarting from the angle equality equation:\n\n-2(p -6)/|CP| = [ - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15 /4) q + 64 ] / (8 |CP| )\n\nMultiply both sides by |CP|:\n\n-2(p -6) = [ - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15 /4) q + 64 ] /8\n\nMultiply both sides by 8:\n\n-16(p -6) = - (17/4)p - (7\u221a15)/4 q + 64\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-64(p -6) = -17p -7\u221a15 q +256\n\nYes, that is correct.\n\nSo expanding:\n\n-64p + 384 = -17p -7\u221a15 q +256\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-64p + 384 +17p +7\u221a15 q -256 =0 \u2192 -47p +7\u221a15 q +128=0 \u2192 47p -7\u221a15 q=128. Correct.\n\nSo equation (2) is correct.\n\nTherefore, the quadratic equation is correct, albeit messy. Hmm.\n\nPerhaps instead of solving for p explicitly, maybe I can find the ratio of areas without knowing exact coordinates?\n\nThe question asks for the ratio of areas [BPC]/[ABC]. Maybe there's a way to express this ratio in terms of BP and PC or other parameters?\n\nAlternatively, since BP/PC =1/2, then if I let BP =x, PC=2x. Then, perhaps using areas with some relations.\n\nAlternatively, using mass point geometry?\n\nWait, mass point assigns masses to vertices so that the ratios of lengths can be used.\n\nGiven BP/PC =1/2, so masses at B and C would be 2 and 1 respectively, so that P divides BC in the ratio BP:PC=1:2. Wait, but earlier we considered that P is not on BC. Wait, mass point typically applies to points along edges, so maybe not applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, using barycentric coordinates.\n\nBarycentric coordinates with respect to triangle ABC.\n\nIn barycentric coordinates, any point P can be expressed as (u, v, w) where u + v + w =1, corresponding to weights at A, B, C.\n\nThe coordinates correspond to masses such that the point P has masses proportional to u, v, w at the vertices.\n\nThe area ratios can be related to the barycentric coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps with the given ratio BP/PC, but since it's not along a side, maybe it's complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using vectors.\n\nLet me think of vectors. Let me denote vectors with position vectors relative to point A as the origin.\n\nLet me set coordinate system as before:\n\nA is (0,0), B is (6,0), C is (17/4, 7\u221a15/4). Let me denote vectors:\n\nVector AB = B - A = (6,0).\n\nVector AC = C - A = (17/4, 7\u221a15/4).\n\nPoint P has position vector p = (p_x, p_y).\n\nGiven that BP / PC =1/2 in terms of length, so |BP| / |PC| = 1/2 \u21d2 |P - B| / |P - C| = 1/2.\n\nThis is equivalent to the locus of P being the Apollonius circle with respect to points B and C with ratio 1:2.\n\nAdditionally, the angle condition angle ABP = angle ACP.\n\nHmm, the Apollonius circle might help here, but combining with the angle condition is still tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use coordinates and proceed numerically?\n\nWait, since the problem is asking for a ratio, maybe the final answer is a rational number, so perhaps the quadratic can be factored or there is a simplification.\n\nLet me see the quadratic equation again: 184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 =0.\n\nLet me see if 184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 can be factored.\n\nLooking for factors of 184*1269 = let's see 184*1269. Hmm, large number. Maybe not easy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps approximate the value of p?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in assuming coordinates and the angle condition?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when setting up the cosine equality?\n\nIn the angle equality setup, I had:\n\nThe cosine of angle ABP equals cosine of angle ACP,\n\nso:\n\n[ (BA \u00b7 BP) / (|BA| |BP|) ) ] = [ (CA \u00b7 CP) / (|CA| |CP|) ) ]\n\nBut cos(theta) = (v \u00b7 w)/( |v||w| ), so the equality holds for the cosines, but angles could be supplementary if the dot products have opposite signs, but since angles are inside the triangle, they should be acute or obtuse in a way that the cosines are equal in magnitude with same sign.\n\nWait, but perhaps I should have considered the absolute values? Hmm, no, the dot product can be negative if the angle is obtuse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have set the cosines equal without considering the signs, but since the angles are equal, their cosines must be equal. So as long as the vectors are oriented correctly, it should be okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the direction of vectors? For example, in the angle at B, BA is pointing towards A from B, and BP is pointing towards P from B, so the angle between them is between vectors BA and BP.\n\nSimilarly, at point C, CA is pointing towards A from C, and CP is pointing towards P from C. So the angle between vectors CA and CP.\n\nTherefore, the dot product expressions are correctly calculated.\n\nHmm. Since I can't seem to find an error in the setup, perhaps proceed numerically.\n\nLet me compute the discriminant sqrt(84097). Since 290\u00b2=84100, sqrt(84097)=290 - \u03b5, where \u03b5\u2248 (84100 -84097)/(2*290)\u2248 3/(580)\u22480.00517. So sqrt(84097)\u2248290 -0.00517\u2248289.9948.\n\nBut precise value is needed? Maybe approximate the roots?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the quadratic factors?\n\nLet me try plugging in p= 1269/184 \u22487. But 7*184=1288, which is more than 1269. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me see 184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 =0.\n\nLet me try p= 3:\n\n184*9=1656, 1656 -1009*3 +1269 \u21921656 -3027 +1269= (1656+1269)=2925 -3027= -102\u22600.\n\np=4: 184*16=2944; 2944 -1009*4 +1269= 2944-4036+1269= (2944+1269)=4213-4036=177\u22600.\n\np=5: 184*25=4600; 4600-5045 +1269= (4600+1269)=5869 -5045=824\u22600.\n\np=2: 184*4=736; 736-2018 +1269= (736+1269)=2005-2018= -13\u22600.\n\nHmm, not obvious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires an approach using the Law of Sines in triangles involving P.\n\nWait, let me consider triangles ABP and ACP.\n\nIn triangle ABP:\n\nAB =6, BP =x, angle at B is \u03b8.\n\nIn triangle ACP:\n\nAC =8, CP=2x, angle at C is \u03b8.\n\nApplying the Law of Sines to both triangles:\n\nIn triangle ABP:\n\nAB / sin(angle APB) = BP / sin(angle BAP) = AP / sin(\u03b8)\n\nIn triangle ACP:\n\nAC / sin(angle APC) = CP / sin(angle CAP) = AP / sin(\u03b8)\n\nSince angle APB and angle APC are supplementary? Not necessarily, since point P is inside the triangle, so angles at P from APB and APC are different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps relate angles at P.\n\nWait, in triangles ABP and ACP, AP is a common side. Let's denote AP = y.\n\nFrom triangle ABP:\n\nAP / sin(\u03b8) = AB / sin(angle APB) \u21d2 y / sin\u03b8 =6 / sin(angle APB).\n\nFrom triangle ACP:\n\nAP / sin\u03b8 = AC / sin(angle APC) \u21d2 y / sin\u03b8 =8 / sin(angle APC).\n\nTherefore, 6 / sin(angle APB) =8 / sin(angle APC).\n\nThus, sin(angle APC)/sin(angle APB)=8/6=4/3.\n\nHmm, angle APB and angle APC are angles at P in triangles APB and APC. Since point P is inside the triangle, the sum of angles around P is 360\u00b0, but not sure how to relate these angles.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle BPC, the angles at P could be related?\n\nAlternatively, the lines from P to the vertices form angles that can be connected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Law of Sines in triangle BPC?\n\nWait, but I don't know angles there.\n\nAlternatively, since we have BP=x, PC=2x, and BC=7. Maybe use Stewart's theorem on triangle BPC? But need more info.\n\nAlternatively, consider coordinates again but compute numerically.\n\nLet me proceed with approximate values.\n\nLet me compute p from quadratic equation 184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula:\n\np = [1009 \u00b1 sqrt(84097)]/(2\u00d7184).\n\nTake sqrt(84097)= approx 289.9948.\n\nThus,\n\np \u2248 [1009 \u00b1289.9948]/368.\n\nCompute both roots:\n\nFirst root: (1009 +289.9948)/368\u22481298.9948/368\u22483.529.\n\nSecond root: (1009 -289.9948)/368\u2248719.0052/368\u22481.954.\n\nNow, since the coordinates of B are at (6,0) and C is at (17/4\u22484.25, something). So the x-coordinate of P must be between 0 and 6, and between 0 and 4.25? Not sure, but let's see.\n\nWait, P is inside the triangle ABC. The triangle has vertices at A(0,0), B(6,0), C(4.25, ~7.9). So the x-coordinate of P should be between 0 and 6, and y-coordinate between 0 and up to ~7.9.\n\nThe two roots for p (x-coordinate) are approximately 3.529 and 1.954. Let me see which one makes sense.\n\nLet me test both possibilities.\n\nFirst, take p \u22483.529.\n\nThen compute q from equation (2): q=(47p -128)/(7\u221a15).\n\nPlugging p\u22483.529,\n\n47*3.529 \u224847*3.5=164.5 +47*0.029\u2248164.5+1.363\u2248165.863.\n\n165.863 -128=37.863.\n\nThus, q\u224837.863/(7*3.872)= since \u221a15\u22483.872.\n\nSo denominator\u22487*3.872\u224827.104.\n\nThus q\u224837.863/27.104\u22481.397.\n\nSo coordinates (3.529,1.397). Check if this is inside the triangle.\n\nThe triangle's vertices are at (0,0), (6,0), (4.25, ~7.9). The point (3.5,1.4) would be inside, probably closer to the base AB.\n\nSecond root p\u22481.954,\n\nCompute q: (47*1.954 -128)/(7\u221a15).\n\n47*1.954\u224847*2=94 -47*0.046\u224894-2.162\u224891.838.\n\n91.838 -128\u2248-36.162.\n\nThus q\u2248-36.162/(7\u221a15)\u2248-36.162/27.104\u2248-1.334.\n\nNegative y-coordinate, which would place P below the x-axis, but the triangle is above the x-axis (since point C has positive y). So this point is outside the triangle. So we discard this root.\n\nThus, the valid solution is approximately (3.529,1.397).\n\nNow, with coordinates of P known approximately, compute areas.\n\nFirst compute [ABC].\n\nUsing coordinates:\n\nA(0,0), B(6,0), C(17/4, (7\u221a15)/4).\n\nThe area can be computed via the shoelace formula:\n\nArea = (1/2)| (0*(0 - 7\u221a15/4) +6*(7\u221a15/4 -0) +17/4*(0 -0) ) |.\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (1/2)| 0 +6*(7\u221a15/4) +0 | = (1/2)*(42\u221a15/4) = (42\u221a15)/8 = (21\u221a15)/4.\n\nAlternatively, since we had earlier coordinates, we can compute it directly.\n\nAlternatively, using Heron's formula. Given sides AB=6, AC=8, BC=7.\n\nPerimeter semiperimeter s=(6+8+7)/2=10.5.\n\nArea= sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))=sqrt(10.5*(10.5-6)(10.5-8)(10.5-7)).\n\nCompute:\n\n10.5*4.5*2.5*3.5.\n\nLet me compute:\n\n10.5*3.5 =36.75,\n\n4.5*2.5=11.25,\n\nThus, 36.75 *11.25 =410.0625.\n\nSo area= sqrt(410.0625)= approx 20.25. Wait, exact value?\n\nWait, 21\u221a15 /4:\n\n\u221a15\u22483.87298,\n\n21*3.87298\u224821*3.873\u224881.333,\n\nDivide by4: \u224820.333.\n\nHmm, which matches approximately with Heron's: sqrt(410.0625)=20.25. The discrepancy is because Heron's formula with decimal approx?\n\nWait, let me compute Heron's exactly:\n\ns=21/2,\n\ns-a=21/2-6=21/2-12/2=9/2,\n\ns-b=21/2-8=21/2-16/2=5/2,\n\ns-c=21/2-7=21/2-14/2=7/2.\n\nThus,\n\nArea= sqrt( (21/2)*(9/2)*(5/2)*(7/2) ) = sqrt( (21*9*5*7)/(16) ) = sqrt( (21*9*35)/16 ) since 5*7=35.\n\nWait, 21*9*5*7=21*5*63=105*63=6615.\n\nThus sqrt(6615/16)=sqrt(6615)/4.\n\nBut 6615= 21*315=21*9*35= 21*9*5*7= same as before. Hmm, but 6615= 441*15, since 441*15=6615. So sqrt(441*15)=21\u221a15. Thus sqrt(6615)/4=21\u221a15/4. So exact area is (21\u221a15)/4. Okay, good.\n\nNow compute [BPC].\n\nCoordinates of B(6,0), P(3.529,1.397), C(4.25, (7\u221a15)/4\u2248(4.25, 7*3.872/4\u22487*0.968\u22487. 7*3.872 is 27.104, divided by4 is ~6.776).\n\nWait, precise coordinates of C are (17/4, (7\u221a15)/4 ). So exact y-coordinate is (7\u221a15)/4.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nB: (6, 0)\n\nP: approx (3.529,1.397)\n\nC: (4.25, (7\u221a15)/4\u22486.776)\n\nCompute area of BPC using shoelace formula.\n\nFormula:\n\nArea = (1/2)|x_B(y_P - y_C) +x_P(y_C - y_B) +x_C(y_B - y_P)|\n\nPlugging in:\n\n= (1/2)|6*(1.397 -6.776) +3.529*(6.776 -0) +4.25*(0 -1.397)|\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term:6*( -5.379)= -32.274\n\nSecond term:3.529*6.776\u22483.529*6=21.174; 3.529*0.776\u22482.742 \u2192 total\u224823.916\n\nThird term:4.25*(-1.397)\u2248-5.932\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n-32.274 +23.916 -5.932 \u2248-32.274+23.916= -8.358 -5.932\u2248-14.29\n\nTake absolute value and multiply by 1/2: 14.29*0.5\u22487.145.\n\nSo approximate area [BPC] \u22487.145.\n\nThen the ratio [BPC]/[ABC]\u22487.145/(21\u221a15/4).\n\nCompute denominator:21*3.872/4\u224821*0.968\u224820.328.\n\nSo 7.145/20.328\u22480.3515.\n\nHmm, so approximately 0.35. 35%.\n\nBut the problem likely has an exact value. 0.35 is 7/20 or 14/40, but maybe 1/3? Not exactly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the exact coordinates give a precise ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of using approximate coordinates, solve symbolically.\n\nWe can compute the area ratio using coordinates symbolically.\n\nGiven that the coordinates of P are (p, q), then the area of BPC can be computed via determinant.\n\nArea of BPC is (1/2)| (B_x(C_y - P_y) + C_x(P_y - B_y) + P_x(B_y - C_y) ) |.\n\nPlugging in coordinates:\n\nB is (6,0), C is (17/4, (7\u221a15)/4 ), P is (p,q).\n\nThus,\n\nArea = (1/2)|6*( (7\u221a15/4 - q) ) + (17/4)*(q -0) + p*(0 -7\u221a15/4 ) |.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term:6*(7\u221a15/4 - q) = (42\u221a15)/4 -6q\n\nSecond term: (17/4)*q\n\nThird term: p*(-7\u221a15/4 )\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n(42\u221a15)/4 -6q +17q/4 - (7\u221a15 p)/4\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nFor q terms: (-6q +17q/4 ) = (-24q/4 +17q/4)= (-7q)/4.\n\nFor \u221a15 terms: (42\u221a15)/4 - (7\u221a15 p)/4 = (7\u221a15/4)(6 -p).\n\nThus:\n\nArea = (1/2)| (7\u221a15/4)(6 -p) -7q/4 |.\n\nFactor out 7/4:\n\n= (1/2)*(7/4)| \u221a15(6 -p) - q |.\n\nThus:\n\nArea [BPC] = (7/8)| \u221a15(6 -p) - q |.\n\nSimilarly, the area of triangle ABC is (21\u221a15)/4.\n\nThus the ratio is [BPC]/[ABC] = [ (7/8)|\u221a15(6 -p) - q | ] / [ (21\u221a15)/4 ] = (7/8)/(21\u221a15/4) * |\u221a15(6-p) - q |.\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n(7/8) / (21\u221a15/4) = (7/8)*(4/(21\u221a15)) )= (7*4)/(8*21\u221a15) = (28)/(168\u221a15)= (1)/(6\u221a15).\n\nThus ratio= (1)/(6\u221a15) * |\u221a15(6 -p) - q |.\n\nTherefore, need to compute |\u221a15(6-p) - q |.\n\nFrom equation (2):47p -7\u221a15 q =128 \u21d27\u221a15 q=47p -128 \u21d2 q=(47p -128)/(7\u221a15).\n\nSubstitute into the expression \u221a15(6-p) - q:\n\n\u221a15(6 -p) - (47p -128)/(7\u221a15).\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator to combine terms:\n\n= [\u221a15 * \u221a15 (6 -p) - (47p -128)/7 ] / \u221a15 ?\n\nWait, let me compute directly:\n\n\u221a15(6-p) - q = \u221a15(6-p) - (47p -128)/(7\u221a15).\n\nTo combine terms, multiply numerator and denominator:\n\n= [ 7*15(6-p) - (47p -128) ] / (7\u221a15).\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nLet me write everything over 7\u221a15:\n\n\u221a15(6-p) = [7\u221a15 * \u221a15 (6-p)] / (7\u221a15) ) ?\n\nAlternatively, let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: \u221a15(6-p) multiplied by 7\u221a15 to get denominator 7\u221a15:\n\n\u221a15*(6-p)*7\u221a15 =7*15*(6-p).\n\nSecond term: q = (47p -128)/(7\u221a15), so subtract that term:\n\nSo overall:\n\n\u221a15(6-p) - q = [7*15*(6-p) - (47p -128) ] / (7\u221a15).\n\nWait:\n\nWait, let me compute numerator:\n\n\u221a15(6-p) - q = [\u221a15(6-p) *7\u221a15 - (47p-128) ] / (7\u221a15)\n\nWait, that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, compute numerator as:\n\n\u221a15(6-p)*7\u221a15 - (47p -128) ?\n\nNo, let me just compute numerator:\n\nLet me compute numerator as:\n\n\u221a15(6-p) - q = \u221a15(6-p) - (47p -128)/(7\u221a15)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator terms by 7\u221a15 to combine:\n\n= [7*15*(6-p) - (47p -128) ] / (7\u221a15).\n\nYes, that works:\n\n\u221a15(6-p)*(7\u221a15) =7*15*(6-p),\n\nand q*(7\u221a15)=47p-128,\n\nso overall numerator is 7*15*(6-p) - (47p-128).\n\nThus:\n\nNumerator of the expression: 7*15*(6-p) -47p +128.\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst term:7*15*6 = 630,\n\n7*15*(-p)= -105p,\n\nSo total:630 -105p -47p +128 =630+128 - (105+47)p =758 -152p.\n\nThus,\n\n\u221a15(6-p) - q = (758 -152p)/(7\u221a15).\n\nThus, the absolute value is |758 -152p|/(7\u221a15).\n\nTherefore, the area ratio becomes:\n\n[1/(6\u221a15)] * [ |758 -152p|/(7\u221a15) ) ] = |758 -152p|/(6\u221a15 *7\u221a15 )\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n6*7*(\u221a15)^2 =42*15=630.\n\nThus ratio is |758 -152p|/630.\n\nTherefore, [BPC]/[ABC] = |758 -152p|/630.\n\nNow, we have to compute 758 -152p.\n\nBut from earlier, we have equation (2):47p -7\u221a15 q=128, but also from the quadratic solution, perhaps we can find 758 -152p.\n\nWait, let me see if 758 -152p can be expressed using the equation.\n\nAlternatively, from equation (2):47p =7\u221a15 q +128.\n\nBut also, from equation (1a):\n\n6p\u00b2 +6q\u00b2 -79p +7\u221a15 q +160 =0.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since we have p from the quadratic equation.\n\nRecall that quadratic equation was 184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 =0.\n\nLet me write 152p = (152/184)*184p = (19/23)*184p.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, notice that 758 -152p = ?\n\nLet me compute 758 -152p:\n\nLet me express 152p = (152/184)*184p = (19/23)*184p.\n\nWait, but 184p\u00b2 =1009p -1269 from the quadratic equation.\n\nHmm, 184p\u00b2 =1009p -1269,\n\nSo 184p\u00b2 -1009p =-1269.\n\nThus, 152p = ?\n\nAlternatively, let me see:\n\nLet me compute 758 -152p.\n\nLet me factor numerator:\n\n758-152p = -

(152/184)*1009p + (152/184)*1269 =0.\n\nThis gives 152p\u00b2 - (152*1009)/184 p + (152*1269)/184 =0.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express 152p as:\n\nLet me note that 152 = (184)*(152/184), but this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the value of p from the quadratic equation.\n\nRecall that p = [1009 \u00b1 sqrt(84097)]/(2\u00d7184).\n\nCompute 152p:\n\n152*(1009 \u00b1 sqrt(84097))/(368)\n\n= (152/368)*(1009 \u00b1 sqrt(84097))\n\nSimplify 152/368 = 152/(152*2.42) no, 368=152*2.42? Wait, 152\u00d72=304, 152\u00d72.4= 364.8, so no. Wait, 368 divided by 152: 368 \u00f7152 = 2.42? Wait, 152\u00d72=304, 368-304=64, so 64/152=0.421. So 2.421. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, compute 152p -758:\n\nLet me take p as [1009 + sqrt(84097)]/368 approximately:\n\nsqrt(84097)=289.9948,\n\nso p\u2248(1009+289.9948)/368\u22481298.9948/368\u22483.529.\n\nThus, 152p\u2248152\u00d73.529\u2248536.7,\n\nThus 758 -536.7\u2248221.3.\n\nThus, the absolute value is 221.3, so ratio\u2248221.3/630\u22480.351, which matches the approximate calculation earlier.\n\nBut need an exact value.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator 758-152p can be expressed using the quadratic equation.\n\nFrom quadratic equation:\n\n184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269=0 \u21d2184p\u00b2=1009p-1269.\n\nLet me see 758-152p:\n\nLet me try to express 758-152p in terms of p\u00b2.\n\nLet me solve for p\u00b2 from quadratic equation:\n\np\u00b2=(1009p -1269)/184.\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute (758 -152p)\u00b2 to see if it relates to the discriminant.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait, recall that the area ratio is |758 -152p|/630.\n\nIf I can find 758-152p from the quadratic equation.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me multiply the quadratic equation by something.\n\nLet me see the quadratic equation:\n\n184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 =0.\n\nLet me compute 152p:\n\nLet me write 184p\u00b2 =1009p -1269,\n\nMultiply both sides by 152/(184*1009):\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of 758-152p as a multiple of the equation terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that:\n\nThe area ratio is |758 -152p|/630.\n\nIf I can find 758-152p from the quadratic equation, but it's not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in the algebra leading to the area ratio expression?\n\nWait, let me retrace the steps for the area ratio.\n\nStarting from the expression for the area of BPC:\n\nArea [BPC] = (7/8)|\u221a15(6-p) - q|.\n\nThen, substituting q from equation (2): q=(47p -128)/(7\u221a15).\n\nTherefore,\n\n\u221a15(6-p) - q = \u221a15(6-p) - (47p -128)/(7\u221a15).\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n= [\u221a15(6-p)*7\u221a15 - (47p -128)] / (7\u221a15).\n\nWait, common denominator 7\u221a15.\n\nThe numerator becomes:\n\n7*(15)*(6-p) - (47p -128)= 7*15*6 -7*15 p -47p +128.\n\nCalculate term by term:\n\n7*15*6 = 630,\n\n-7*15 p =-105p,\n\n-47p,\n\n+128.\n\nThus total numerator:630 +128 - (105+47)p =758 -152p.\n\nYes, so that is correct. So numerator is 758-152p.\n\nThus, [BPC]/[ABC] = |758 -152p| /630.\n\nNow, to find this, we need to compute 758-152p.\n\nFrom quadratic equation:\n\n184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 =0 \u21d2 184p\u00b2 =1009p -1269.\n\nExpress 152p as (152/184)*184p = (19/23)*184p.\n\nHmm, perhaps multiply the quadratic equation by 19/23:\n\n(19/23)(184p\u00b2) - (19/23)(1009p) + (19/23)(1269)=0.\n\nBut this gives terms involving p\u00b2 and p, which may not help.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that 758-152p = ?\n\nLet me try to express this in terms of the quadratic equation:\n\nLet me denote S =758 -152p,\n\nthen,\n\n152p =758 - S \u21d2 p = (758 -S)/152.\n\nSubstitute into quadratic equation:\n\n184*( (758 -S)/152 )\u00b2 -1009*(758 -S)/152 +1269 =0.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps plugging in S as a variable, but this may not help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that 758-152p = k*(quadratic equation terms).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the numerator evaluates to sqrt(D)*something?\n\nWait, recall that p=(1009\u00b1sqrt(D))/(2*184).\n\nThus,\n\n758 -152p =758 -152*(1009 \u00b1sqrt(D))/(2*184).\n\nSimplify:\n\n152/(2*184)=76/184=19/46.\n\nThus,\n\n758 -152p=758 - (19/46)*(1009 \u00b1sqrt(D)).\n\nCompute 19/46 *1009:\n\n1009 divided by46 is approx 22. But exactly,\n\n46\u00d722=1012, so 1009=46\u00d722 -3,\n\nThus, 19/46\u00d71009=19*(22 - 3/46)= 19\u00d722 -19\u00d73/46=418 - 57/46\u2248418-1.239\u2248416.761.\n\nSimilarly, sqrt(D)=sqrt(84097)=\u2248289.9948,\n\nThus,\n\n758 - [ (19/46)(1009 \u00b1289.9948) ].\n\nTake the positive root first (since p is the valid solution):\n\n758 - [ (19/46)(1009 +289.9948) ].\n\nCompute 1009+289.9948\u22481299.\n\nThus,\n\n(19/46)*1299\u2248(19*1299)/46.\n\n1299 divided by46 is approx 28.239,\n\n19\u00d728.239\u2248536.54.\n\nThus,\n\n758 -536.54\u2248221.46.\n\nThus, the absolute value is 221.46, so the ratio is\u2248221.46/630\u22480.3515.\n\nHmm. Since the problem likely has a nice fractional answer, maybe this is 7/20 or 14/40, but 0.3515 is closer to 7/20=0.35, but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value is 1/3 or something else.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nLet me use mass point or area ratios with Ceva.\n\nWait, given angle ABP = angle ACP. Maybe use trigonometric Ceva.\n\nTrigonometric Ceva's Theorem states that for concurrent cevians from A,B,C, the following holds:\n\n[sin(angle ABP)/sin(angle CBP)] * [sin(angle BCP)/sin(angle ACP)] * [sin(angle CAP)/sin(angle BAP)] =1.\n\nBut we know angle ABP = angle ACP =\u03b8.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet angle ABP = angle ACP =\u03b8.\n\nLet angle CBP=\u03c6,\n\nangle BCP=\u03c8,\n\nangle CAP=\u03b1,\n\nangle BAP=\u03b2.\n\nSince angle at B: angle ABP + angle CBP = angle at B.\n\nSimilarly, angle at C: angle ACP + angle BCP = angle at C.\n\nAlso, angle at A: angle BAP + angle CAP = angle at A.\n\nAssuming the cevians AP,BP,CP are concurrent, but not sure if they are. However, maybe we can still apply trigonometric Ceva.\n\nAssuming concurrency, then:\n\n[sin\u03b8/sin\u03c6] * [sin\u03c8/sin\u03b8] * [sin\u03b1/sin\u03b2] =1.\n\nSimplifies to [sin\u03c8/sin\u03c6][sin\u03b1/sin\u03b2]=1.\n\nBut I don't know the values of these angles.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables for the angles.\n\nLet me denote angle at B: let\u2019s call \u2220ABC = \u03b2, \u2220ACB = \u03b3, \u2220BAC = \u03b1.\n\nWe know sides AB=6, AC=8, BC=7. So using the Law of Cosines, we can find the angles.\n\nCompute angles of triangle ABC first.\n\nUsing Law of Cosines:\n\ncos \u03b1 = (b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -a\u00b2)/(2bc).\n\nWhere a=BC=7, b=AC=8, c=AB=6.\n\nThus,\n\ncos \u03b1 = (8\u00b2 +6\u00b2 -7\u00b2)/(2\u00d78\u00d76)= (64+36-49)/96 = (51)/96 =17/32.\n\nThus angle \u03b1 = arccos(17/32).\n\nSimilarly, angle at B:\n\ncos \u03b2 = (a\u00b2 +c\u00b2 -b\u00b2)/(2ac)= (7\u00b2+6\u00b2-8\u00b2)/(2\u00d77\u00d76)= (49+36-64)/84=(21)/84=1/4.\n\nThus angle \u03b2= arccos(1/4).\n\nAngle at C:\n\ncos \u03b3=(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 -c\u00b2)/(2ab)= (7\u00b2+8\u00b2-6\u00b2)/(2\u00d77\u00d78)= (49+64-36)/112=(77)/112=11/16.\n\nThus angle \u03b3= arccos(11/16).\n\nHmm, maybe this can help.\n\nGiven angle ABP=\u03b8 and angle ACP=\u03b8.\n\nLet me denote angle ABP=\u03b8 \u21d2 angle CBP=\u03b2 -\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, angle ACP=\u03b8 \u21d2 angle BCP=\u03b3 -\u03b8.\n\nIn trigonometric Ceva:\n\n[sin\u03b8/sin(\u03b2-\u03b8)] * [sin(\u03b3-\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] * [sin(angle CAP)/sin(angle BAP)] =1.\n\nWait, this simplifies to:\n\n[sin\u03b8/sin(\u03b2\u2212\u03b8)] * [sin(\u03b3\u2212\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] * [sin(angle CAP)/sin(angle BAP)] =1\n\nSimplifies to [sin(\u03b3\u2212\u03b8)/sin(\u03b2\u2212\u03b8)] * [sin(angle CAP)/sin(angle BAP)] =1.\n\nHmm, but angle CAP and angle BAP are parts of angle \u03b1 at A.\n\nLet me denote angle BAP = x \u21d2 angle CAP = \u03b1 -x.\n\nThus:\n\n[sin(\u03b3\u2212\u03b8)/sin(\u03b2\u2212\u03b8)] * [sin(\u03b1\u2212x)/sinx] =1.\n\nHmm, but still multiple variables. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using the ratio BP/PC=1/2.\n\nFrom mass point perspective, if we consider point P such that BP/PC=1/2, then masses at B and C would be 2 and 1 respectively, but since P is not on BC, this might not directly apply.\n\nAlternatively, using the Law of Sines in triangles involving P.\n\nLet me consider triangle ABP and APC.\n\nIn triangle ABP:\n\nAB=6, BP= x, angle at B is \u03b8.\n\nIn triangle APC:\n\nAC=8, CP=2x, angle at C is \u03b8.\n\nLaw of Sines:\n\nIn ABP: AB/sin(angle APB) = BP/sin(angle BAP) = AP/sin\u03b8\n\nIn APC: AC/sin(angle APC) = CP/sin(angle CAP) = AP/sin\u03b8\n\nThus,\n\nFrom ABP: 6/sin(angle APB) = x/sin(angle BAP)\n\nFrom APC:8/sin(angle APC) =2x/sin(angle CAP)\n\nAlso, angle APB + angle APC + something = 180? Not sure.\n\nBut angle APB and angle APC are angles at P in their respective triangles.\n\nThe sum of the angles around point P should be 360\u00b0, so angle APB + angle APC + angle BPC + angle APB? Wait, maybe this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, note that angle APB and angle APC are supplementary with angle BPC?\n\nNot sure.\n\nAlternatively, denote angle APB = \u03c6 and angle APC = \u03c8.\n\nThen in triangle BPC, the angles at P are related to \u03c6 and \u03c8?\n\nHmm, this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that AP is the angle bisector or something?\n\nAlternatively, let me assume that the ratio [BPC]/[ABC] is 1/3 or 2/7, but need to check.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the problem using barycentric coordinates.\n\nIn barycentric coordinates with reference triangle ABC, any point P can be expressed as (u, v, w), where u + v + w =1, and u, v, w are masses at A,B,C.\n\nThe area ratios are proportional to the barycentric coordinates.\n\nThe condition BP/PC =1/2 in terms of lengths.\n\nWait, in barycentric coordinates, the mass at B is proportional to w_C and vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio of areas can be connected through the given angle condition.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider vectors again.\n\nLet me denote vectors with A as the origin.\n\nLet me denote vector AB = B - A = (6,0).\n\nVector AC = C - A = (17/4, 7\u221a15/4).\n\nLet me denote vector AP = p = (p_x,p_y).\n\nThe point P is such that angle ABP = angle ACP.\n\nThe vectors involved in angle ABP are BA and BP.\n\nVector BA = A - B = (-6,0).\n\nVector BP = P - B = (p_x -6, p_y).\n\nThe angle between BA and BP is equal to the angle between CA and CP.\n\nVector CA = A - C = (-17/4, -7\u221a15/4).\n\nVector CP = P - C = (p_x -17/4, p_y -7\u221a15/4).\n\nThe cosine of the angles between these vectors must be equal, so:\n\n(BA \u00b7 BP)/(|BA||BP|) = (CA \u00b7 CP)/(|CA||CP|).\n\nWe already did this earlier, leading to the quadratic equation, which gives the approximate ratio of 0.3515.\n\nGiven that the problem is likely expecting an exact value, perhaps the discriminant sqrt(84097) is actually a multiple of \u221a15 or something?\n\nWait, 84097 divided by 15 is 5606.466..., not an integer.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the area ratio simplifies to (758 -152p)/630, and with p being a root of the quadratic equation, perhaps this expression can be simplified using the equation.\n\nLet me compute 758 -152p.\n\nFrom quadratic equation:\n\n184p\u00b2 =1009p -1269.\n\nLet me solve for p:\n\np = (1009 \u00b1 sqrt(1009\u00b2 -4\u00d7184\u00d71269))/(2\u00d7184).\n\nBut substituting this into 758-152p might not help.\n\nAlternatively, compute 152p:\n\nLet me write 152p = (152/184)*184p = (19/23)(1009p -1269)/p) ??? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that 152p = (152/184)*184p = (19/23)*184p.\n\nBut 184p= [1009p -1269]/p * something? Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the numerator 758 -152p:\n\nSuppose I let this equal to k.\n\nThen, k =758 -152p \u21d2 p=(758 -k)/152.\n\nSubstitute into quadratic equation:\n\n184*((758 -k)/152)^2 -1009*(758 -k)/152 +1269=0.\n\nThis would allow solving for k, but it\u2019s a quadratic in k, which might not be easier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 7/20, which is 0.35. Let me see:\n\nIf the ratio is 0.35, that is 7/20. Then 7/20 divided by (21\u221a15)/4 would not make sense. Wait, no, the ratio is [BPC]/[ABC], which is around 0.35.\n\nWait, the area of ABC is (21\u221a15)/4 \u224820.33.\n\nSo 0.35 of that is about7.1, which matches the approximate calculation.\n\nBut 7/20 is 0.35 exactly, so perhaps the exact value is 7/20?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nSuppose the exact value is 7/20.\n\nThen 7/20 = |758-152p|/630 \u21d2 |758-152p|=7/20 *630=220.5.\n\nThus, 758 -152p=220.5 \u21d2152p=758-220.5=537.5 \u21d2p=537.5/152\u22483.536, which is close to the approximate solution of p\u22483.529.\n\nThe slight discrepancy is due to rounding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value is 221/630.\n\n221 divided by630 is\u22480.3507, which is very close to the approximate 0.3515.\n\n221/630 simplifies?\n\n221 and630: GCD(221,630). 221=13\u00d717; 630=2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75\u00d77. No common factors. So 221/630 is reduced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 221/630 is the exact fraction.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf 758-152p=221,\n\nthen p=(758-221)/152=537/152\u22483.5329,\n\nwhich is close to the approximate root p\u22483.529, but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is 758-152p= sqrt(84097)'s related term?\n\nWait, sqrt(84097)=289.9948\u2248290.\n\nThen 758-152p=758-152*(1009 +290)/368 ?\n\nWait, let me compute p=(1009+sqrt(84097))/368.\n\nThus,\n\n152p =152*(1009 + sqrt(84097))/368 = (152/368)*(1009 + sqrt(84097)).\n\nSimplify 152/368=0.4107.\n\nThus,\n\n758 -152p =758 -0.4107*(1009 +289.9948)=758 -0.4107*(1298.9948).\n\nCalculate 1298.9948\u00d70.4107\u22481299\u00d70.4107\u2248533.0,\n\nThus, 758 -533.0\u2248225.0.\n\nHmm, which brings us to 225/630= 15/42=5/14\u22480.357, which is different.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe it's exactly 221/630, but I need to see.\n\nAlternatively, since this problem is from a competition, perhaps there's a better approach leading to an exact answer without going through coordinates.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nGiven triangle ABC with AB=6, AC=8, BC=7.\n\nPoint P inside with BP/PC=1/2 and angle ABP=angle ACP.\n\nNeed to find [BPC]/[ABC].\n\nLet me try using Ceva's theorem with trigonometric form.\n\nThe trigonometric Ceva's condition for concurrency is:\n\n[sin(angle ABP)/sin(angle CBP)] * [sin(angle BCP)/sin(angle ACP)] * [sin(angle CAP)/sin(angle BAP)] =1.\n\nGiven angle ABP = angle ACP =\u03b8.\n\nLet me denote angle ABP=\u03b8 \u21d2 angle CBP= angle B -\u03b8,\n\nangle ACP=\u03b8 \u21d2 angle BCP= angle C -\u03b8,\n\nangle CAP= let\u2019s say \u03c6 \u21d2 angle BAP= angle A -\u03c6.\n\nThus plug into Ceva:\n\n[sin\u03b8/sin(angle B -\u03b8)] * [sin(angle C -\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] * [sin\u03c6/sin(angle A -\u03c6)] =1.\n\nSimplify first two terms:\n\n[sin\u03b8/sin(B\u2212\u03b8)] * [sin(C\u2212\u03b8)/sin\u03b8] = sin(C\u2212\u03b8)/sin(B\u2212\u03b8).\n\nThus the equation becomes:\n\nsin(C\u2212\u03b8)/sin(B\u2212\u03b8) * [sin\u03c6/sin(A\u2212\u03c6)] =1.\n\nHmm, but how to relate \u03c6?\n\nAlternatively, use the ratio BP/PC=1/2.\n\nMaybe using the Law of Sines in triangles BPC and others.\n\nIn triangle BPC:\n\nBP/PC=1/2 \u21d2 BP= (1/2) PC.\n\nUsing the Law of Sines in triangle BPC:\n\nBP/sin(angle BCP)= PC/sin(angle PBC).\n\nThus,\n\n(1/2 PC)/sin(angle BCP)= PC/sin(angle PBC).\n\nCancel PC:\n\n(1/2)/sin(angle BCP)=1/sin(angle PBC).\n\nThus,\n\nsin(angle PBC)=2 sin(angle BCP).\n\nBut angle PBC= angle B - angle ABP= angle B -\u03b8,\n\nangle BCP= angle C -\u03b8.\n\nThus,\n\nsin(angle B -\u03b8)=2 sin(angle C -\u03b8).\n\nLet me write this equation:\n\nsin(\u03b2 -\u03b8)= 2 sin(\u03b3 -\u03b8),\n\nwhere \u03b2 is angle at B, \u03b3 is angle at C.\n\nEarlier computed angles:\n\n\u03b2= arccos(1/4),\n\n\u03b3= arccos(11/16).\n\nThus,\n\nsin(\u03b2 -\u03b8)=2 sin(\u03b3 -\u03b8).\n\nLet me denote x=\u03b8,\n\nthen:\n\nsin(\u03b2 -x)=2 sin(\u03b3 -x).\n\nExpand both sides using sine difference identity:\n\nsin\u03b2 cosx - cos\u03b2 sinx = 2[sin\u03b3 cosx -cos\u03b3 sinx].\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nsin\u03b2 cosx - cos\u03b2 sinx - 2 sin\u03b3 cosx +2 cos\u03b3 sinx =0.\n\nFactor terms with cosx and sinx:\n\n[ sin\u03b2 - 2 sin\u03b3 ] cosx + [ -cos\u03b2 +2 cos\u03b3 ] sinx =0.\n\nLet me compute coefficients numerically.\n\nFirst compute sin\u03b2, cos\u03b2, sin\u03b3, cos\u03b3.\n\nGiven:\n\ncos\u03b2 =1/4 \u21d2 sin\u03b2=\u221a(1 - (1/4)^2)=\u221a(15/16)=\u221a15/4\u22480.9682.\n\ncos\u03b3=11/16 \u21d2 sin\u03b3=\u221a(1 - (121/256))=\u221a(135/256)= (3\u221a15)/16\u22480.9627.\n\nThus,\n\nsin\u03b2\u2248\u221a15/4\u22480.9682,\n\nsin\u03b3\u2248 (3\u221a15)/16\u22480.9627/3?

Wait, need to think.\n\nWait, the entire area of ABC is [ABC]=[ABP]+[BPC]+[APC].\n\nWait no, APB and APC are overlapping?\n\nActually, the triangle is divided into three smaller triangles: ABP, BPC, and APC, plus the central triangle APQ or something? No, no, actually, the point P divides the triangle into three smaller triangles: ABP, BPC, and APC, and the central area? No, actually, when you have a point inside a triangle connected to the vertices, it divides the triangle into three smaller triangles. Wait, no, connecting P to all three vertices divides the triangle into three smaller triangles: ABP, BPC, and APC. Thus, [ABC]=[ABP]+[BPC]+[APC].\n\nThus,\n\n[ABC] = [ABP] + [BPC] + [APC]\n\nWe have:\n\n[ABP]=3x sin\u03b8,\n\n[APC]=8x sin\u03b8,\n\nso total [ABP]+[APC]=11x sin\u03b8,\n\nThus,\n\n[BPC]= [ABC] -11x sin\u03b8.\n\nBut we need to find [BPC]/[ABC]=1 - (11x sin\u03b8)/[ABC].\n\nHmm, but need to find x or relate x to the sides.\n\nAlternatively, use Law of Sines in triangle ABP and triangle APC.\n\nIn triangle ABP:\n\nAP/sin(angle ABP)= BP/sin(angle BAP).\n\n angle ABP=\u03b8,\n\n angle BAP= angle at A in ABP: let's denote angle BAP=\u03b11,\n\n angle APB= 180-\u03b8 -\u03b11.\n\nSimilarly in triangle APC:\n\nAP/sin(angle ACP)= PC/sin(angle CAP).\n\n angle ACP=\u03b8,\n\n angle CAP= angle at A in APC: let's denote angle CAP=\u03b12,\n\n angle APC=180 -\u03b8 -\u03b12.\n\nAlso, angle BAP + angle CAP = angle BAC=\u03b1.\n\nThus, \u03b11 +\u03b12=\u03b1.\n\nAdditionally, from Ceva's condition earlier, we had the equation involving the angles.\n\nAlternatively, using the areas:\n\n[ABP]/[APC] = (3x sin\u03b8)/(8x sin\u03b8)=3/8.\n\nThus the ratio of areas [ABP]/[APC] =3/8.\n\nAlso, the lines from P divide the triangle such that the areas are proportional.\n\nAdditionally, the ratio BP/PC=1/2.\n\nPerhaps using mass point or area ratios.\n\nLet me think of masses at B and C as 2 and1, so that P divides BC in ratio BP:PC=1:2. But P is not on BC, but masses can still be used in other ways.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of areas:\n\nLet me assume that the ratio [BPC]/[ABC]=k, which is what we need to find.\n\nThen [ABP] + [APC] = (1 -k)[ABC].\n\nAlso, [ABP]/[APC]=3/8 \u21d2 [APC]=(8/3)[ABP].\n\nThus,\n\n[ABP] + (8/3)[ABP] = (11/3)[ABP] = (1 -k)[ABC].\n\nThus,\n\n[ABP] = (3/11)(1 -k)[ABC].\n\nBut also, [ABP]=3x sin\u03b8,\n\nand [ABC]= (21\u221a15)/4\u224820.33.\n\nBut without knowing x or \u03b8, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the total area [ABC]= [ABP] + [BPC] + [APC] = ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use coordinates with the approximate angle to compute the ratio.\n\nPreviously, with approximate coordinates, the ratio is\u22480.3515\u22487/20.\n\nBut 221/630\u22480.3507 is close.\n\nAlternatively, let me see:\n\nThe quadratic equation was 184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 =0.\n\nThe numerator for the ratio is |758-152p|.\n\nLet me compute 758-152p when p is the solution.\n\nLet me compute 152p from the quadratic equation.\n\nThe quadratic equation is 184p\u00b2 =1009p -1269.\n\nLet me compute 152p = (152/184)*184p= (19/23)*(1009p -1269)/p * p? No, that's not helpful.\n\nWait, rearrange the quadratic equation:\n\n184p\u00b2 -1009p +1269 =0,\n\nMultiply both sides by 152:\n\n152\u00d7184p\u00b2 -152\u00d71009p +152\u00d71269=0,\n\nExpress 152\u00d7184p\u00b2 = (152\u00d7184)p\u00b2,\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that 758-152p = 758 - (1009p -1269)*(152/184).\n\nWait:\n\nFrom quadratic equation: 1009p -184p\u00b2=1269,\n\nThus,\n\n1009p=184p\u00b2 +1269,\n\nThus,\n\n152p= (152/1009)(184p\u00b2 +1269).\n\nHmm, substituting into 758 -152p,\n\n758 - (152/1009)(184p\u00b2 +1269).\n\nBut this seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the exact value of 758-152p.\n\nLet me use p = [1009 + sqrt(84097)]/(2\u00d7184).\n\nThus,\n\n758 -152p =758 -152*(1009 + sqrt(84097))/(2\u00d7184).\n\nSimplify:\n\n152/(2\u00d7184)= (152)/(368)=19/46.\n\nThus,\n\n758 - (19/46)(1009 + sqrt(84097)).\n\nCompute this expression:\n\nLet me compute (19/46)*1009:\n\n1009 divided by46 is 22 with remainder 3 (since 46\u00d722=1012, so 1009=46\u00d722 -3).\n\nThus,\n\n(19/46)*1009 =19*(22 - 3/46)=19\u00d722 - 19\u00d73/46=418 - 57/46\u2248418-1.239\u2248416.761.\n\nSimilarly, (19/46)*sqrt(84097)= (19/46)*289.9948\u2248(19\u00d7289.9948)/46\u22485509.901/46\u2248119.78.\n\nThus,\n\nTotal:\n\n758 - [416.761 +119.78 ]=758 -536.541\u2248221.459.\n\nThus, the numerator is approximately 221.459, so the ratio is 221.459/630\u22480.3515.\n\nSince this is very close to 221/630, and 221 and 630 are both integers, maybe that's the exact value.\n\nLet me check 221/630 simplifies? GCD(221,630).\n\n221 factors:13\u00d717,\n\n630 factors:2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75\u00d77. No common factors. So yes, 221/630 is the simplified fraction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the exact value is 221/630, but let me verify.\n\nWait, the numerator was 758-152p=221.459, which is approximately 221.46, close to 221.5 which is 443/2. But 221 is an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the exact value is 221/630, but the problem might have a nicer fractional answer, but given the steps, I think this is the most precise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a calculation mistake in the area expression.\n\nWait, the area ratio was:\n\n[BPC]/[ABC] = (7/8)|\u221a15(6-p) - q| / (21\u221a15/4).\n\nWait, let me re-calculate that step:\n\nEarlier steps:\n\nArea [BPC] = (7/8)|\u221a15(6-p) - q|,\n\nArea [ABC] =21\u221a15/4,\n\nThus the ratio is:\n\n(7/8 |\u221a15(6-p) - q| ) / (21\u221a15/4) = (7/8) / (21\u221a15/4) * |\u221a15(6-p) - q|,\n\nWhich is (7/(8))*(4/(21\u221a15))) * |...|= (28)/(168\u221a15) * |...|= (1/(6\u221a15)) * |...|,\n\nThen the |...| term was (758-152p)/7\u221a15,\n\nThus total:\n\n[1/(6\u221a15)] * (758 -152p)/(7\u221a15) = (758-152p)/(6\u221a15 *7\u221a15)= (758-152p)/(6*7*15)= (758-152p)/630.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the ratio is exactly (758 -152p)/630.\n\nSince p is a solution to the quadratic equation, substituting it gives the numerator as 758 -152p which evaluates numerically to approximately221.46, hence the ratio\u2248221.46/630\u22480.3515.\n\nSince the problem asks to compute the ratio and put it in a box, likely as a fraction. Given that 221 and 630 have no common factors, the exact value is 221/630, but let me check if that reduces.\n\nWait, 221 divided by13 is 17, 630 divided by13 is ~48.46. Not integer. 221 divided by 17 is13, 630/17~37. So no, so 221/630 is simplest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of the given lengths?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in my approach. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 1/3.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nAssume that the ratio [BPC]/[ABC]=k.\n\nGiven BP/PC=1/2 \u21d2 BP= (1/3)BC? No, because it's not along BC.\n\nAlternatively, using mass points with masses at B and C as 2 and1, so mass at P is 3.\n\nThen the mass at A must be something to satisfy the angle condition.\n\nAlternatively, mass point can give area ratios.\n\nThe masses at B and C are 2 and1, so the mass at P is 3.\n\nThe mass at A is m, so the mass at P from A's side is also m + something?\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the mass at A must be such that the angle condition is satisfied. This might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the area ratio is 1/3, but the approximate answer is ~0.35 which is close to 1/3=0.333.\n\nAlternatively, 7/20=0.35.\n\nAlternatively, since 221/630 simplifies to 221/630\u22480.35, and 221/630 is the exact fraction, perhaps that is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, let me check with the approximate coordinates:\n\nWith P at (3.529,1.397),\n\nCompute [BPC]:\n\nUsing shoelace formula:\n\nCoordinates:\n\nB(6,0), P(3.529,1.397), C(4.25,6.776).\n\nCompute area:\n\n1/2 | (6*(1.397-6.776) +3.529*(6.776-0)+4.25*(0-1.397)) |.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n6*( -5.379)= -32.274,\n\n3.529*6.776\u224823.916,\n\n4.25*(-1.397)\u2248-5.932.\n\nSum: -32.274+23.916-5.932\u2248-14.29.\n\nAbsolute value *1/2: 7.145.\n\n[ABC] is 21\u221a15/4\u224820.333.\n\nRatio:7.145/20.333\u22480.3515.\n\nThis is very close to 221/630\u22480.3515 (since 221/630\u22480.3507). The slight difference is due to rounding.\n\nTherefore, the exact fraction is 221/630, but let me see if 221/630 can be simplified further.\n\n221 divided by 17 is 13, 630 divided by 17 is 37.05, no. 221 is 13\u00d717, 630 is 2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75\u00d77. No common factors. So 221/630 is simplest.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the answer in terms of square roots, but given the approximate decimal is about 0.35, and the problem likely expects an exact value, so I think the answer is 221/630. But I need to check.\n\nWait, let me compute 221 divided by 630:\n\n221/630 \u22480.3507936508,\n\nwhile my approximate calculation was 0.3515, which is very close. Hence, it's likely the exact value is 221/630.\n\nBut to confirm:\n\nLet me compute 758 -152p where p is the solution:\n\np=(1009 + sqrt(84097))/368.\n\nsqrt(84097)=289.9948,\n\nThus,\n\n758 -152*(1009 +289.9948)/368,\n\n=758 - (152/368)*(1009+289.9948),\n\n=758 - (19/46)*(1298.9948),\n\nCompute 1298.9948\u00d719=24680.89,\n\nDivide by46:24680.89/46\u2248536.54,\n\nThus,\n\n758-536.54\u2248221.46,\n\nSo numerator is221.46, so the ratio is221.46/630\u22480.3515.\n\nTherefore, the exact fraction is (758 -152p)/630, which evaluates to approximately221.46/630, which is very close to221/630.\n\nGiven the problem is likely designed to have a clean answer, perhaps we made a miscalculation somewhere, but given the steps, this is the most precise answer I can get.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the answer as \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{20}} since 0.35 is close and a simpler fraction.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if 758-152p is exactly 221.46, but perhaps the exact value is 221.46, which is not a whole number. Therefore, maybe the answer is 221/630, but simplifying:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(221,630)=1. So it stays as 221/630.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the answer as a reduced fraction of 221/630, but maybe there's a miscalculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the shoelace formula for area of BPC.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate area with exact coordinates.\n\nCoordinates:\n\nB(6,0),\n\nP(p,q)=(3.529,1.397),\n\nC(17/4,7\u221a15/4).\n\nExact coordinates of C:\n\nx=4.25, y=(7*3.87298)/4\u2248(27.1109)/4\u22486.7777.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nB(6,0),\n\nP(3.529,1.397),\n\nC(4.25,6.7777).\n\nCompute area using shoelace:\n\nArrange points:\n\nB(6,0),\n\nP(3.529,1.397),\n\nC(4.25,6.7777),\n\nB(6,0).\n\nCompute sum of x_i y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} y_i:\n\nFirst term:6*1.397 +3.529*6.7777 +4.25*0 - [0*3.529 +1.397*4.25 +6.7777*6].\n\nCompute each part:\n\nFirst part:\n\n6*1.397=8.382,\n\n3.529*6.7777\u22483.529*6.7777\u224823.92,\n\n4.25*0=0,\n\nTotal first part:8.382+23.92+0\u224832.302.\n\nSecond part:\n\n0*3.529=0,\n\n1.397*4.25\u22485.942,\n\n6.7777*6\u224840.666,\n\nTotal second part:0+5.942+40.666\u224846.608.\n\nSubtract:32.302 -46.608\u2248-14.306.\n\nAbsolute value divided by2:14.306/2\u22487.153.\n\nThus area\u22487.153,\n\nRatio to [ABC]=21\u221a15/4\u224821\u00d73.872/4\u224820.33,\n\n7.153/20.33\u22480.352.\n\nThus the exact value is approximately0.352, which is 221/630\u22480.3508 or 222/630=37/105\u22480.352.\n\nAh! 222/630 reduces to37/105.\n\nWait 222 divided by6=37, 630/6=105.\n\nYes, 222/630=37/105\u22480.35238.\n\nThis is very close to the approximate0.352.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the exact value is37/105.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf the numerator is222, then:\n\n37/105=222/630.\n\nSo perhaps I made an arithmetic mistake in numerator calculation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nThe numerator is758-152p.\n\nWith p\u22483.529,\n\n152\u00d73.529\u2248152\u00d73.5=532 +152\u00d70.029\u2248532+4.408\u2248536.408,\n\nThus,\n\n758 -536.408\u2248221.592.\n\nHmm, which would be\u2248221.592/630\u22480.3517.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, 37/105\u22480.35238,\n\n221.592/630\u22480.3517.\n\nThis is very close.\n\nPerhaps the exact value is 37/105.\n\nBecause 37 and 105 are both divisible by?\n\n37 is prime. 105=5\u00d721=5\u00d73\u00d77. So no common factors. Thus, 37/105 is simplified.\n\nHow can we get 222?\n\nIf in the numerator 758-152p=222,\n\nthen p=(758-222)/152=536/152=268/76=134/38=67/19\u22483.526,\n\nwhich is very close to our approximate p\u22483.529.\n\nThis suggests that the exact value of the numerator is 222, leading to 37/105.\n\nPerhaps there was a rounding error earlier when I approximated sqrt(84097)=289.9948.\n\nLet me compute sqrt(84097) more accurately:\n\n289\u00b2=83521,\n\n290\u00b2=84100,\n\nso sqrt(84097)=290 - \u03b5,\n\nwhere \u03b5\u2248(84100-84097)/(2\u00d7290)=3/(580)=0.0051724.\n\nThus, sqrt(84097)=290 -0.0051724\u2248289.9948276.\n\nThus,\n\np=(1009 +289.9948276)/(2\u00d7184)= (1298.9948276)/368\u22483.52982.\n\nThen,\n\n152p=152\u00d73.52982\u2248152\u00d73.5=532, plus 152\u00d70.02982\u22484.53,\n\nTotal\u2248536.53,\n\nThus,\n\n758 -536.53\u2248221.47,\n\nThus, it's \u2248221.47/630\u22480.3515.\n\nHmm. The closest fraction with small denominator is37/105\u22480.35238.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires the answer as a fraction in the form \\boxed{\\dfrac{37}{105}}.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the coordinate setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using mass point.\n\nGiven BP/PC=1/2, so mass at B is2, mass at C is1.\n\nThus mass at P is3.\n\nThe mass at A should be determined by the angle condition.\n\nThe masses would give the ratios along the other sides.\n\nThe mass at A is m, so the mass at P from side AB would be m+2, and from AC would be m+1.\n\nThe angle condition may relate to the masses.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of AP to the other sides?\n\nAlternatively, the cevians from A,B,C have masses, and the angle condition requires the masses to be in a particular ratio.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of Ceva's theorem with masses.\n\nThe masses at A,B,C are m_A, m_B=2, m_C=1.\n\nFor Ceva's theorem to hold, (m_A/m_B)*(m_B/m_C)*(m_C/m_A)=1.\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the mass at P is m_A + m_B= m_A+2 from the AB side, and m_A + m_C= m_A+1 from the AC side.\n\nThe angle condition may enforce that these masses relate to the angle equality.\n\nThe angle ABP=angle ACP.\n\nThe mass point might not directly give the angle condition, but maybe the direction of the cevians.\n\nThe cevians AP, BP, CP must create the angle equality.\n\nAlternatively, this is getting too vague.\n\nGiven that the approximate value is about0.352, which is very close to37/105\u22480.35238, and since37/105 reduces to simplest terms, I will go with that.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{37}{105}}.\n\nWait, but let me check37\u00d721=777, 105\u00d77=735, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 221/630 vs 37/105:\n\n37/105= (37\u00d76)/(105\u00d76)=222/630.\n\nThus, the difference between221/630 and37/105 is1/630\u22480.0016.\n\nGiven my calculation of the numerator as\u2248221.47, which is between221 and222, so the exact value is likely221.47/630\u22480.3515.\n\nSince the problem is likely constructed to have a clean answer, and37/105 is very close and a simpler fraction, I'll go with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{20}} since it is a simpler fraction close to the approximate.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if37/105 reduces further? 37 is prime. 105 is5\u00d721, so no. So37/105 is simplest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my mistake was in the area expression.\n\nWait, in the area ratio expression:\n\n[BPC]/[ABC] = (758 -152p)/630.\n\nIf the exact value of this is 221/630\u22480.3507, then the answer is221/630.\n\nBut221 divided by13 is17, so maybe221/630=13\u00d717/(13\u00d748.46). No.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different approach leading to a nicer answer.\n\nWait, let me think of using coordinates again but in a different system.\n\nLet me place point B at (0,0), point C at (7,0), and point A somewhere in the plane.\n\nGiven AB=6, AC=8, BC=7.\n\nUsing coordinates:\n\nLet me set B at (0,0), C at (7,0).
