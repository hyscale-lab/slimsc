      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where there are three distinct complex numbers a, b, and c. Each of them satisfies a quadratic equation with the next variable plus 6. Specifically, a squared equals b plus 6, b squared equals c plus 6, and c squared equals a plus 6. The question is asking for the two possible values of a + b + c. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, since all three equations are cyclic, maybe I can find a way to combine them. The variables are connected in a cycle: a \u2192 b \u2192 c \u2192 a. Since they are distinct, I can't assume any of them are equal, so that might complicate things. But perhaps adding all three equations together could be helpful? Let's see.\n\nAdding the three equations:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (b + 6) + (c + 6) + (a + 6)\n\nSimplify the right side:\n\n= a + b + c + 18\n\nSo, moving all terms to the left side:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a - b - c - 18 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps yet. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the next and substitute? Let's see.\n\nFrom the first equation, b = a\u00b2 - 6\n\nFrom the second equation, c = b\u00b2 - 6\n\nSubstituting the first into the second gives c = (a\u00b2 - 6)\u00b2 - 6\n\nSimilarly, substitute that into the third equation. The third equation is c\u00b2 = a + 6.\n\nSo, let's substitute c first:\n\nc = (a\u00b2 - 6)^2 - 6\n\nTherefore, c squared would be [(a\u00b2 - 6)^2 - 6]^2, and that equals a + 6.\n\nSo, [(a\u00b2 - 6)^2 - 6]^2 = a + 6\n\nThis seems like a very high-degree equation. Let me see how to handle that. Maybe expanding step by step?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think about the sum a + b + c. Let me denote S = a + b + c. Maybe I can find an equation involving S?\n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract equations to find relationships between a, b, c. Let's see.\n\nTake the first equation: a\u00b2 = b + 6\n\nSecond: b\u00b2 = c + 6\n\nThird: c\u00b2 = a + 6\n\nLet me subtract the first equation from the second. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, let's consider the difference between equations? Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express all variables in terms of a. Since b is expressed in terms of a, and c in terms of b, so in terms of a, so then c in terms of a, and then substitute into the third equation. Let me try that path again because even though it might lead to a high-degree equation, maybe there's a trick.\n\nSo, starting with a, then b = a\u00b2 -6,\n\nc = b\u00b2 -6 = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6,\n\nthen c squared is [(a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6]^2,\n\nand according to the third equation, that should equal a +6.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n[(a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6]^2 = a +6\n\nThis is a quartic equation inside a quartic, so degree 8? That's really complicated. Maybe expanding this is not feasible. Perhaps another approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the system is symmetric. Maybe assuming that a, b, c are roots of some equation? For example, if they are roots of a cubic equation, then perhaps we can think of S = a + b + c, P = ab + bc + ca, Q = abc. Maybe we can find equations for S, P, Q?\n\nAlternatively, let me try adding all three equations again as I did before. Let me write that again:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c) + 18.\n\nBut also, note that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca). Let me denote S = a + b + c, and P = ab + bc + ca. Then,\n\nS\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2P\n\nFrom the first equation, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S + 18, so substituting into above,\n\nS\u00b2 = (S + 18) + 2P \u21d2 2P = S\u00b2 - S - 18 \u21d2 P = (S\u00b2 - S - 18)/2\n\nHmm, so that's an expression for P in terms of S. Maybe we can find another equation involving P and S.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider multiplying the three original equations together? Let me see:\n\na\u00b2 * b\u00b2 * c\u00b2 = (b +6)(c +6)(a +6)\n\nLeft side is (abc)^2\n\nRight side is (a+6)(b+6)(c+6)\n\nHmm, so (abc)^2 = (a+6)(b+6)(c+6)\n\nThis might be another equation involving S, P, and Q (the product abc). Let me see.\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n(a+6)(b+6)(c+6) = abc + 6(ab + bc + ca) + 36(a + b + c) + 216\n\nTherefore, (abc)^2 = abc + 6(ab + bc + ca) + 36S + 216\n\nLet me denote Q = abc. Then,\n\nQ\u00b2 = Q + 6P + 36S + 216\n\nNow, if I can express P and S in terms of S, since I already have P in terms of S (from above, P = (S\u00b2 - S - 18)/2), then perhaps substitute that into the equation.\n\nSo substituting P into the equation:\n\nQ\u00b2 = Q + 6*( (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2 ) + 36S + 216\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n6*( (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2 ) = 3*(S\u00b2 - S -18) = 3S\u00b2 - 3S -54\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\nQ\u00b2 = Q + 3S\u00b2 - 3S -54 + 36S + 216\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-3S + 36S = 33S\n\n-54 + 216 = 162\n\nSo,\n\nQ\u00b2 = Q + 3S\u00b2 + 33S + 162 - 54 + 216? Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, the terms after expanding:\n\n3S\u00b2 -3S -54 + 36S + 216.\n\nSo, combining terms:\n\n3S\u00b2 + ( -3S + 36S ) + ( -54 + 216 )\n\nSo that's 3S\u00b2 + 33S + 162.\n\nThus, Q\u00b2 = Q + 3S\u00b2 + 33S + 162.\n\nHmm, so now we have an equation involving Q and S. But this is still complicated. We need another relation between Q and S. Let's see if there's another equation involving Q.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider the original equations and try to form equations for ab + bc + ca.\n\nWait, let's think of expressions for each variable in terms of the next. Let's write each equation as:\n\na\u00b2 - b = 6,\n\nb\u00b2 - c = 6,\n\nc\u00b2 - a =6.\n\nIf we multiply all three equations together, maybe that gives something?\n\n(a\u00b2 - b)(b\u00b2 - c)(c\u00b2 - a) = 6^3 = 216.\n\nBut expanding that might be even worse. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, subtract the equations pairwise?\n\nTake the first equation minus the second: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = b - c\n\nFactor left side: (a - b)(a + b) = (b - c)\n\nSimilarly, the second minus third: b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 = c - a \u21d2 (b - c)(b + c) = (c - a)\n\nThird minus first: c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 = a - b \u21d2 (c - a)(c + a) = (a - b)\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me note these three equations:\n\n1) (a - b)(a + b) = -(c - b) [since b - c = -(c - b)]\n\nWait, actually let me re-derive:\n\nFirst equation minus second gives:\n\na\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (b + 6) - (c + 6) \u21d2 Wait, original equations are:\n\nWait, original equations are a\u00b2 = b +6, so a\u00b2 - b =6,\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2 - c =6,\n\nand c\u00b2 -a =6.\n\nWait, so actually, the first equation is a\u00b2 - b =6,\n\nSecond is b\u00b2 - c =6,\n\nThird is c\u00b2 -a =6.\n\nTherefore, first equation minus second equation:\n\n(a\u00b2 - b) - (b\u00b2 - c) = 6 -6 \u21d2 a\u00b2 - b - b\u00b2 + c =0 \u21d2 a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - b + c =0.\n\nFactor a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 as (a - b)(a + b):\n\nThus, (a - b)(a + b) + (c - b) =0.\n\nHmm, so (a - b)(a + b) = (b - c)\n\nSimilarly, second minus third equation:\n\n(b\u00b2 - c) - (c\u00b2 -a) =0 \u21d2 b\u00b2 - c - c\u00b2 +a =0 \u21d2 b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 + a - c =0.\n\nFactor b\u00b2 - c\u00b2 as (b - c)(b + c):\n\nThus, (b - c)(b + c) + (a - c) =0 \u21d2 (b - c)(b + c) = (c - a)\n\nThird minus first equation:\n\n(c\u00b2 - a) - (a\u00b2 - b) =0 \u21d2 c\u00b2 -a -a\u00b2 + b =0 \u21d2 c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 + b -a =0.\n\nFactor c\u00b2 -a\u00b2 as (c -a)(c +a):\n\nThus, (c -a)(c +a) + (b -a)=0 \u21d2 (c -a)(c +a) = (a -b )\n\nHmm, so we have three equations:\n\n1) (a - b)(a + b) = (b - c)\n\n2) (b - c)(b + c) = (c - a)\n\n3) (c - a)(c + a) = (a - b)\n\nHmm, interesting. Let me see if these can be linked together. Let me denote the differences as variables maybe?\n\nLet me denote x = a - b, y = b - c, z = c - a. But note that x + y + z = (a - b) + (b - c) + (c - a) = 0. So they sum to zero. But maybe this complicates.\n\nAlternatively, notice that equations 1, 2, 3 can be multiplied together. Let's see:\n\nLeft side of each equation:\n\n1) (a - b)(a + b)\n\n2) (b - c)(b + c)\n\n3) (c - a)(c + a)\n\nMultiply all left sides: (a - b)(b - c)(c - a) * (a + b)(b + c)(c + a)\n\nRight sides multiplied: (b - c)(c - a)(a - b)\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nThe right side of equation 1 is (b - c)\n\nRight side of 2 is (c - a)\n\nRight side of 3 is (a - b)\n\nThus, multiplying all right sides: (b - c)(c - a)(a - b)\n\nTherefore, multiplying equations 1,2,3 together gives:\n\n[(a - b)(a + b)(b - c)(b + c)(c - a)(c + a)] = [(b - c)(c - a)(a - b)]\n\nWe can cancel out (a - b)(b - c)(c - a) from both sides, provided they are non-zero. Since a, b, c are distinct, each factor (a - b), (b - c), (c - a) is non-zero, so we can divide both sides by them, resulting in:\n\n(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = 1\n\nHmm, that's a nice equation: (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = 1.\n\nThat might be useful. Let me write that down.\n\nSo, (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = 1.\n\nHmm, now, how can we use this? Let's see.\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nFirst, note that (a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Let me expand two terms first.\n\nLet me compute (a + b)(b + c) first:\n\n= a(b + c) + b(b + c) = ab + ac + b\u00b2 + bc\n\nThen multiply by (c + a):\n\n= [ab + ac + b\u00b2 + bc] * (c + a)\n\nThis seems tedious, but perhaps there's a better way to expand it.\n\nAlternatively, recall that (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc.\n\nWait, let me verify that formula. Let me think:\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c,\n\nP = ab + bc + ca,\n\nQ = abc.\n\nThen, (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (S - c)(S - a)(S - b) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, alternatively, expanding (a + b)(b + c)(c + a):\n\nLet me write it as (a + b + c - c)(a + b + c - a)(a + b + c - b). Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me expand step by step:\n\nFirst, (a + b)(b + c) = ab + a c + b\u00b2 + b c,\n\nthen multiply by (c + a):\n\nMultiply each term:\n\n(ab)(c) + (ab)(a) + (ac)(c) + (ac)(a) + (b\u00b2)(c) + (b\u00b2)(a) + (bc)(c) + (bc)(a)\n\nWait, this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use the identity:\n\n(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc\n\nYes, I think that is a standard identity. Let me check with a=1, b=1, c=1:\n\nLeft side: 2*2*2=8,\n\nRight side: (3)(3) -1=9-1=8, so that works.\n\nAnother test with a=0, b=1, c=2:\n\nLeft: (0+1)(1+2)(2+0)=1*3*2=6,\n\nRight: (0+1+2)(0*1 +1*2 +2*0) -0 = 3*(0 +2 +0) -0 = 3*2=6. Yep, correct.\n\nSo, the identity holds. Therefore,\n\n(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - abc = S*P - Q =1\n\nSo, S*P - Q =1.\n\nWe already have expressions for P in terms of S, and maybe Q can be related somehow?\n\nEarlier, from the equation obtained after multiplying all three original equations, we had Q\u00b2 = Q + 3S\u00b2 + 33S + 162.\n\nAlso, we have P = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2.\n\nSo, substituting P into the equation S*P - Q =1,\n\nS * [ (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2 ] - Q =1\n\nLet me write that:\n\n[ S(S\u00b2 - S -18) ] / 2 - Q =1\n\nSo,\n\nQ = [ S(S\u00b2 - S -18) ] / 2 -1\n\nThus, Q = (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S)/2 -1 = (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)/2\n\nSo, now, substituting this expression for Q into the equation Q\u00b2 = Q + 3S\u00b2 + 33S + 162.\n\nLet me do that step by step.\n\nLeft side: Q\u00b2 = [ (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)/2 ]\u00b2\n\nRight side: Q + 3S\u00b2 + 33S + 162 = [ (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)/2 ] + 3S\u00b2 + 33S + 162\n\nThis seems very messy, but let's try to write the equation:\n\n[ (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)/2 ]\u00b2 = [ (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)/2 ] + 3S\u00b2 + 33S + 162\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n[ (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)^2 ] = 2[ (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2) ] + 12S\u00b2 + 132S + 648\n\nHmm, expanding the left side would be a lot of work, but perhaps there's a better approach. Alternatively, maybe we can assume that S is a real number? Wait, but the problem states that a, b, c are complex numbers, so S could be complex. However, maybe the possible values of S are real? Not sure, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying small integer values for S? Since the equations might have symmetric solutions. Let me think: suppose S = a + b + c, and maybe S is a small integer. Let me test S=0.\n\nWait, but first, let's see, if S=0, then from P = (0 -0 -18)/2 = -9,\n\nThen Q = (0 -0 -0 -2)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1,\n\nSo then check if Q\u00b2 = Q + 3(0)^2 + 33*0 +162.\n\nLeft side: (-1)^2 =1,\n\nRight side: -1 + 0 +0 +162 =161,\n\n1 \u2260 161. Not working.\n\nTry S=3.\n\nThen P = (27 -3 -18)/2 = (6)/2 =3,\n\nQ = (27 -9 -54 -2)/2 = (-38)/2 = -19,\n\nCheck Q\u00b2 = (-19)^2 = 361,\n\nRight side: -19 + 3*(9) + 33*3 +162,\n\n= -19 +27 +99 +162 = (-19 +27)=8; 8 +99=107; 107+162=269. 361 vs 269. Not equal.\n\nHmm.\n\nHow about S = -3?\n\nThen P = ( (-27) - (-3) -18)/2 = (-27 +3 -18)/2 = (-42)/2 = -21,\n\nQ = ( (-27) -9 - (-54) -2 ) /2 ?\n\nWait, S is -3,\n\nS\u00b3 = (-3)^3 = -27,\n\nS\u00b2 = 9,\n\nS term is -18*(-3)=54? Wait no, the expression for Q is (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)/2,\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b3 = (-3)^3 = -27,\n\nS\u00b2 = 9,\n\n-18S = -18*(-3)=54,\n\nSo altogether: -27 -9 +54 -2 = (-27 -9)= -36; (-36 +54)=18; 18 -2=16,\n\nThus, Q = 16/2 =8.\n\nThen check Q\u00b2 = 64,\n\nRight side: Q + 3S\u00b2 +33S +162 = 8 + 3*(9) + 33*(-3) +162\n\n=8 +27 -99 +162,\n\n8+27=35; 35-99= -64; -64 +162=98. 64 vs 98. Not equal.\n\nHmm.\n\nTrying S=6?\n\nWait, perhaps this trial and error is not the way. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a symmetry where a, b, c are roots of equation x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Px - Q =0. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the system has a solution where a + b + c = S. Maybe S can be found by assuming some relation. Let me see if S can be 0. Wait, earlier tried that. Not working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equations can be manipulated to find S.\n\nWait, let's consider that each variable squared is the next variable plus 6. So if we consider the sum a + b + c = S,\n\nThen the sum of the equations:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = a + b + c + 18 \u21d2 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S + 18,\n\nBut also, (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) \u21d2 S\u00b2 = (S + 18) + 2P,\n\nWhich gives 2P = S\u00b2 - S -18 \u21d2 P = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2. Which we already have.\n\nAlso, from the equation (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) =1,\n\nBut (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = S*P - Q =1 \u21d2 Q = S*P -1,\n\nSo, Q = S*( (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2 ) -1,\n\nWhich is the same as earlier. So, perhaps substituting into the equation from the product of the original equations.\n\nWait, the product of the original equations was:\n\n(abc)^2 = (a+6)(b+6)(c+6),\n\nwhich was expanded to Q\u00b2 = Q +6P +36S +216,\n\nWait, so as before, substituting Q and P in terms of S into that equation gives an equation in S only, which can be solved for S. But that equation is going to be an eighth-degree equation? Maybe. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to find S by considering that the system is cyclic. Let me think of substituting variables.\n\nSuppose I let a + b + c = S,\n\nand consider the equations a\u00b2 = b +6, so each term is the next variable plus 6. Let me write the equations as:\n\na\u00b2 - b =6,\n\nb\u00b2 - c =6,\n\nc\u00b2 - a =6.\n\nAdding all three equations gives a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (a + b + c) =18,\n\nWhich is the same as before, leading to a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S + 18.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider cycling through the variables, perhaps adding the three equations cyclically gives a system that can be manipulated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that if I set all variables equal, but the problem states they are distinct, so that can't be. But maybe the equations would have a solution where they are equal, but since they must be distinct, that solution is invalid. However, maybe the sum S can still be derived from such a case?\n\nSuppose for a moment that a = b = c, then each equation would be a\u00b2 = a +6 \u21d2 a\u00b2 -a -6 =0 \u21d2 a=(1 \u00b1\u221a25)/2 \u21d2 (1 \u00b15)/2 \u21d2 3 or -2. So if they were equal, the sum would be 9 or -6. But since they must be distinct, those are not valid, but perhaps the actual sums are related? Maybe the possible values of S are 9 and -6? But let me check.\n\nWait, if S were 9, but then let's see if that's possible.\n\nSuppose S =9,\n\nThen P = (81 -9 -18)/2 = (54)/2 =27,\n\nQ = (729 -81 -162 -2)/2 = (729 -81=648; 648-162=486; 486-2=484; 484/2=242). So Q=242,\n\nThen check equation Q\u00b2 = Q +3S\u00b2 +33S +162,\n\nLeft side: 242\u00b2=58564,\n\nRight side: 242 +3*81 +33*9 +162,\n\n242 +243 + 297 +162 = 242+243=485; 485+297=782; 782+162=944. 58564 vs 944. Not equal. So no.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, if S = -6,\n\nThen P=(36 - (-6) -18)/2=(36+6-18)/2=24/2=12,\n\nQ=( (-216) -36 - (-108) -2)/2,\n\nWait S=-6,\n\nS\u00b3 = (-6)^3 = -216,\n\nS\u00b2 = 36,\n\n-18S = -18*(-6)=108,\n\nSo numerator: -216 -36 +108 -2 = (-216-36)= -252; (-252 +108)= -144; (-144 -2)= -146,\n\nThus Q = -146 /2 = -73,\n\nThen Q\u00b2 = 5329,\n\nRight side: Q +3S\u00b2 +33S +162,\n\n= (-73) + 3*(36) + 33*(-6) +162,\n\n= -73 +108 -198 +162,\n\n-73+108=35; 35-198= -163; -163+162= -1,\n\n5329 vs -1. Not equal. So that's not working either.\n\nHmm. Maybe trying other values? Let me see, perhaps S= something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe S is a root of a quadratic equation. Let me see, since the problem states two possible values for S, so maybe the equation reduces to a quadratic in S?\n\nWait, but given the complexity, perhaps S^2 + ... ?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the system may have solutions where a, b, c are roots of a cubic equation. Let me think of the cubic equation x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Px - Q =0,\n\nwhere S = a + b + c,\n\nP = ab + bc + ca,\n\nQ = abc.\n\nWe have relations between these variables. We can use the equations we have to find S.\n\nWe have:\n\n1) a\u00b2 = b +6,\n\n2) b\u00b2 = c +6,\n\n3) c\u00b2 = a +6.\n\nLet me try to express each variable in terms of the next and substitute into the cubic equation.\n\nWait, perhaps if I consider the cubic equation whose roots are a, b, c. Then, for each root x, we have x\u00b2 = next root +6,\n\nSuppose the roots satisfy x\u00b2 - y -6 =0, where y is the next root. But this might not form a standard equation.\n\nAlternatively, using the equations to form a system:\n\nLet me write the equations as:\n\na\u00b2 - b =6,\n\nb\u00b2 - c =6,\n\nc\u00b2 - a =6.\n\nLet me add them again:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (a + b + c) = 18,\n\nWhich gives a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S +18.\n\nBut also, (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nSo,\n\nS\u00b2 = (S + 18) + 2P \u21d2 2P = S\u00b2 - S -18,\n\nwhich gives P = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2.\n\nNow, also, the product of the equations:\n\n(a\u00b2 -b)(b\u00b2 -c)(c\u00b2 -a)=6*6*6=216,\n\nBut expanding this may not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps considering the system of equations as a cyclic system, so if I consider variables arranged in a cycle, perhaps write equations for a + b + c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the expression for (a + b + c)^3?\n\nWait, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, let me think of substituting variables.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s consider the equations:\n\na\u00b2 = b +6,\n\nb\u00b2 = c +6,\n\nc\u00b2 = a +6.\n\nLet me substitute each into the next equation:\n\nFrom the first equation, b = a\u00b2 -6.\n\nSubstitute into the second equation:\n\nb\u00b2 = c +6 \u21d2 (a\u00b2 -6)^2 = c +6 \u21d2 c = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6.\n\nSubstitute this c into the third equation:\n\nc\u00b2 = a +6 \u21d2 [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]^2 = a +6.\n\nThis is the equation in a. Let me denote this as:\n\nLet\u2019s set f(a) = [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]^2 -a -6 =0.\n\nThis is an eighth-degree equation in a. Solving this directly is tough, but maybe there are some roots that can be found by substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are symmetric solutions where a, b, c are permuted in some way. For example, maybe a, b, c are roots of the same cubic equation, so that they satisfy cyclic permutations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps if we consider that a + b + c = S,\n\nand from the equations, we can write:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S +18,\n\nand also,\n\n(ab + bc + ca) = P = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2,\n\nand (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) =1,\n\nwhich is S*P - Q =1,\n\nand we also have Q\u00b2 = Q +3S\u00b2 +33S +162.\n\nSo combining all these equations, maybe we can find an equation in S only.\n\nLet me try to do that step by step.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom equation (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) =1,\n\nwhich is S*P - Q =1,\n\nso,\n\nQ = S*P -1,\n\nand P = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2,\n\nso,\n\nQ = S*( (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2 ) -1,\n\n= ( S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S ) /2 -1,\n\n= ( S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2 ) /2,\n\nThen, substitute this Q into the equation from the product of equations:\n\nQ\u00b2 = Q +3S\u00b2 +33S +162,\n\nThus,\n\n[ (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)/2 ]\u00b2 = [ (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)/2 ] +3S\u00b2 +33S +162.\n\nMultiply both sides by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)^2 = 2(S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2) + 12S\u00b2 + 132S + 648.\n\nLet me denote the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS):\n\nLHS = (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)^2,\n\nRHS = 2(S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2) + 12S\u00b2 + 132S + 648.\n\nLet me expand the LHS:\n\nLet me denote A = S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2,\n\nthen LHS = A\u00b2 = (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)^2,\n\nExpanding this would be tedious, but let me try:\n\nLet me write A = S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2,\n\nThen A\u00b2 = (S\u00b3)^2 + (-S\u00b2)^2 + (-18S)^2 + (-2)^2 + cross terms,\n\nBut actually, the proper expansion is:\n\n(A)^2 = (S^3)^2 + (-S^2)^2 + (-18S)^2 + (-2)^2 + 2*(S^3*(-S^2) + S^3*(-18S) + S^3*(-2) + (-S^2)*(-18S) + (-S^2)*(-2) + (-18S)*(-2)),\n\nWait, maybe better to do term by term:\n\n(A)^2 = (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)(S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst, S\u00b3*(S\u00b3) = S^6,\n\nS\u00b3*(-S\u00b2) = -S^5,\n\nS\u00b3*(-18S) = -18S^4,\n\nS\u00b3*(-2) = -2S^3,\n\nNext, -S\u00b2*(S\u00b3) = -S^5,\n\n-S\u00b2*(-S\u00b2) = +S^4,\n\n-S\u00b2*(-18S) = +18S^3,\n\n-S\u00b2*(-2) = +2S\u00b2,\n\nNext, -18S*(S\u00b3) = -18S^4,\n\n-18S*(-S\u00b2) = +18S^3,\n\n-18S*(-18S) = +324S^2,\n\n-18S*(-2) = +36S,\n\nFinally, -2*(S\u00b3) = -2S^3,\n\n-2*(-S\u00b2) = +2S^2,\n\n-2*(-18S) = +36S,\n\n-2*(-2) = +4.\n\nNow, let me collect like terms:\n\nStart with the highest degree:\n\nS^6,\n\nS^5 terms: -S^5 - S^5 = -2S^5,\n\nS^4 terms:\n\n-18S^4 (from S\u00b3*(-18S)),\n\n-18S^4 (from -18S*(S\u00b3)),\n\nand +S^4 (from -S\u00b2*(-S\u00b2)),\n\nTotal: (-18 -18 +1) S^4 = (-35 S^4),\n\nS^3 terms:\n\n-2S^3 (from S\u00b3*(-2)),\n\n+18S^3 (from -S\u00b2*(-18S)),\n\n+18S^3 (from -18S*(-S\u00b2)),\n\n-2S^3 (from -2*(S\u00b3)),\n\nTotal: (-2 +18 +18 -2) S^3 = (32) S^3,\n\nS^2 terms:\n\n+2S\u00b2 (from -S\u00b2*(-2)),\n\n+324S^2 (from -18S*(-18S)),\n\n+2S^2 (from -2*(-S\u00b2)),\n\nTotal: (2 +324 +2) S^2 = 328 S\u00b2,\n\nS terms:\n\n+36S (from -18S*(-2)),\n\n+36S (from -2*(-18S)),\n\nTotal: 72S,\n\nConstants: +4.\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nWait, the S terms:\n\nFrom -18S*(-2): +36S,\n\nFrom -2*(-18S): +36S,\n\nTotal 72S.\n\nConstants: from last term -2*(-2) is +4.\n\nSo putting all together,\n\nA\u00b2 = S^6 -2S^5 -35S^4 +32S^3 +328S\u00b2 +72S +4.\n\nNow the RHS is:\n\n2*(S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2) +12S\u00b2 +132S +648,\n\nFirst compute 2*(S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2):\n\n= 2S\u00b3 -2S\u00b2 -36S -4,\n\nThen add 12S\u00b2 +132S +648:\n\n2S\u00b3 -2S\u00b2 -36S -4 +12S\u00b2 +132S +648 =\n\n2S\u00b3 + ( -2S\u00b2 +12S\u00b2 ) + ( -36S +132S ) + ( -4 +648 )\n\n=2S\u00b3 +10S\u00b2 +96S +644.\n\nThus, the equation is:\n\nLHS = RHS,\n\ni.e.,\n\nS^6 -2S^5 -35S^4 +32S^3 +328S\u00b2 +72S +4 = 2S\u00b3 +10S\u00b2 +96S +644.\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\nS^6 -2S^5 -35S^4 +32S^3 +328S\u00b2 +72S +4 -2S\u00b3 -10S\u00b2 -96S -644 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nS^6,\n\n-2S^5,\n\n-35S^4,\n\n32S\u00b3 -2S\u00b3 =30S\u00b3,\n\n328S\u00b2 -10S\u00b2 =318S\u00b2,\n\n72S -96S = -24S,\n\n4 -644= -640.\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nS^6 -2S^5 -35S^4 +30S^3 +318S\u00b2 -24S -640 =0.\n\nWow, that's a sixth-degree equation.

Let me re-examine the equations.\n\nWait, let me consider that the system of equations can be transformed into a single equation in S by using the relationships between S, P, and Q.\n\nWe have:\n\nFrom the three original equations:\n\na\u00b2 = b +6,\n\nb\u00b2 = c +6,\n\nc\u00b2 = a +6.\n\nLet me add them again:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = a + b + c + 18 \u21d2 a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S +18,\n\nAnd we also have:\n\n(ab + bc + ca) = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2,\n\nAnd (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) =1,\n\nWhich gives S*P - Q =1,\n\nAnd Q = S*P -1,\n\nThen the equation from multiplying the original equations:\n\nQ\u00b2 = Q +3S\u00b2 +33S +162.\n\nSo substituting Q = S*P -1 into this equation,\n\n(S*P -1)^2 = (S*P -1) +3S\u00b2 +33S +162.\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n(S*P)^2 - 2S*P +1 = S*P -1 +3S\u00b2 +33S +162.\n\nBring all terms to the left:\n\n(S*P)^2 -2S*P +1 -S*P +1 -3S\u00b2 -33S -162 =0,\n\nThus,\n\n(S*P)^2 -3S*P -3S\u00b2 -33S -160=0.\n\nNow, substituting P = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2,\n\nThus,\n\n[ S*( (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2 )]^2 -3S*( (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2 ) -3S\u00b2 -33S -160 =0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: [ S*( (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2 )]^2 = [ (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S)/2 ]\u00b2 = (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S)^2 /4,\n\nSecond term: -3S*( (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2 ) = -3(S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S)/2,\n\nThird term: -3S\u00b2,\n\nFourth term: -33S,\n\nFifth term: -160,\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n( (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S)^2 ) /4 - [3(S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S)/2] -3S\u00b2 -33S -160 =0,\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n(S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S)^2 -6(S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S) -12S\u00b2 -132S -640 =0.\n\nWait, this is the same as the equation I had earlier:\n\nLet me check,\n\nExpand (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S)^2, which is S^6 -2S^5 -35S^4 +32S^3 + 324S\u00b2,\n\nWait no, previously when I expanded (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)^2, the cross terms were different. Wait, hold on, here I have (S^3 - S^2 -18S)^2, which is different from before. Wait, this seems different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier?\n\nWait, in this current derivation, I substituted Q = S*P -1, then substituted into Q\u00b2 = ... equation, and ended up with an equation that involves (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S)^2, but previously when I multiplied out the equations, I had (S\u00b3 - S\u00b2 -18S -2)^2. So there's a discrepancy here.

Not good.\n\nHmm, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe I need to consider that the problem says \"pairwise distinct complex numbers\", so maybe the two possible values of S are the roots of the quadratic equation we're missing, and the rest are extraneous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better approach. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me suppose that S = a + b + c is the sum we need. Let me consider the equations:\n\nFrom the first equation, a\u00b2 = b +6,\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2 = c +6,\n\nc\u00b2 = a +6.\n\nLet me add all three equations:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = a + b + c + 18 \u21d2 a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S +18,\n\nAlso, we can write each variable in terms of the next:\n\na\u00b2 = b +6 \u21d2 b = a\u00b2 -6,\n\nb\u00b2 = c +6 \u21d2 c = b\u00b2 -6 = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6,\n\nc\u00b2 = a +6 \u21d2 a = c\u00b2 -6 = [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]^2 -6.\n\nThis gives an equation in terms of a only:\n\na = [ (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6 ]^2 -6.\n\nThis is the same eighth-degree equation as before, which is tough to solve directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that a + b + c = S, and then find a relationship between a, b, c in terms of S.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the system is cyclic, so perhaps the variables are roots of a cubic equation of the form x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Px - Q =0,\n\nwhere S, P, Q are as before.\n\nThen, each variable satisfies x\u00b2 = (next variable) +6,\n\nSo, for root a: a\u00b2 = b +6,\n\nSimilarly for b and c.\n\nThen, since they are roots of the cubic, we have:\n\na\u00b3 - S a\u00b2 + P a - Q =0,\n\nBut a\u00b2 = b +6 \u21d2 a\u00b3 = a*(b +6),\n\nThus,\n\na*(b +6) -S a\u00b2 + P a - Q=0,\n\nSubstitute a\u00b2 = b +6,\n\nThus,\n\na b +6a -S(b +6) + P a - Q=0,\n\nRearrange terms,\n\n(a b - S b) + (6a + P a - 6S) - Q =0,\n\nFactor:\n\nb(a - S) + a(6 + P) -6S - Q =0,\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express everything in terms of S.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider adding the three equations:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S +18,\n\nAnd also, the squares of the variables can be expressed via the equations.\n\nLet me consider the sum a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = (b +6)+(c +6)+(a +6) = (a +b +c) +18 \u21d2 which matches what we had.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the product (a -2)(b -2)(c -2). Maybe expanding this?\n\nWait, perhaps trying to find a relation where if we set variables as x = a -2, y = b -2, z =c -2,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that since each variable squared is the next +6,\n\nThen,\n\na\u00b2 - b =6,\n\nb\u00b2 -c =6,\n\nc\u00b2 -a =6.\n\nAdding them gives a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 - (a +b +c) = 18 \u21d2 which we already have.\n\nNow, let me consider multiplying these three equations:\n\n(a\u00b2 -b)(b\u00b2 -c)(c\u00b2 -a)=6^3=216.\n\nBut earlier I saw that expanding this would be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor the terms.\n\nNotice that each term is of the form (variable squared - next variable).\n\nLet me see if I can find a pattern or factorization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that:\n\nLet me denote each equation as:\n\na\u00b2 - b =6 \u21d2 b = a\u00b2 -6,\n\nb\u00b2 -c =6 \u21d2 c = b\u00b2 -6 = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6,\n\nc\u00b2 -a =6 \u21d2 a = c\u00b2 -6 = [(a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6]^2 -6.\n\nThis is an equation in a, which is eighth degree. Perhaps substituting numerical values for a?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are specific solutions where a, b, c are real numbers, and their sum S is real. Then perhaps trial and error with real numbers.\n\nSuppose a is a real number. Let me try to find real solutions.\n\nLet me assume a is real, then b and c are also real.\n\nSuppose a is an integer.\n\nTry a=3,\n\nThen b=3\u00b2-6=9-6=3,\n\nBut b=3, which is same as a, but variables must be distinct. Not allowed.\n\na= -3,\n\nb=9-6=3,\n\nc= (3)^2 -6=9-6=3,\n\nAgain, duplicates.\n\na=2,\n\nb=4 -6= -2,\n\nc=(-2)^2 -6=4-6= -2,\n\nAgain duplicates.\n\na= -2,\n\nb=4-6= -2 \u21d2 duplicate.\n\na=4,\n\nb=16 -6=10,\n\nc=100 -6=94,\n\nThen c\u00b2 -a =94\u00b2 -4 \u2192 way larger than6. Not good.\n\nWait, need c\u00b2 =a +6 \u21d2 c\u00b2 =4 +6=10 \u21d2 c= sqrt(10). Not integer.\n\nHmm,\n\na=1,\n\nb=1-6= -5,\n\nc=25-6=19,\n\nc\u00b2=361 \u21d2 361 =a +6 \u21d2 361=7? No.\n\nHmm,\n\na= sqrt(6 +b).

Maybe I need to consider that the problem states the values are distinct complex numbers, so the two possible values of S are the two complex roots of the cubic, but since it's a cubic with real coefficients, complex roots come in pairs, so the two possible real values are the real root and another? Wait no, the problem says two possible values, so maybe the cubic factors into a quadratic and a linear term, with the quadratic having two roots.\n\nLet me try to factor the cubic:\n\n7S^3 -6S^2 -101S +12=0,\n\nLet me try to factor by grouping,\n\nGroup first two terms and last two terms:\n\n(7S^3 -6S^2) + (-101S +12),\n\nFactor:\n\nS^2(7S -6) - (101S -12),\n\nDoesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, group as (7S^3 -101S) + (-6S^2 +12),\n\n= S(7S\u00b2 -101) -6(S\u00b2 -2),\n\nNot helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to find a root numerically.\n\nLet me try S= 4,\n\n7*64=448 -6*16=96 \u21d2448-96=352,\n\n-101*4= -404 \u21d2352-404= -52,\n\n-52 +12= -40,\n\nAt S=4, the value is -40,\n\nAt S=5,\n\n7*125=875-6*25=150 \u21d2875-150=725,\n\n-101*5= -505 \u21d2725-505=220,\n\n220+12=232,\n\nThus between S=4 and S=5, the cubic goes from -40 to 232, so crosses zero there.\n\nSimilarly at S=3,\n\n7*27=189-6*9=54 \u21d2135,\n\n135-303= -168,\n\n-168+12= -156,\n\nAt S=2,\n\n7*8=56-24=32,\n\n32-202= -170,\n\n-170+12= -158,\n\nAt S=1,\n\n7-6-101 +12= -88,\n\nAt S=0,\n\n12.\n\nThus, there's a root between S=4 and S=5,\n\nAnother between S= -infty and S=?\n\nWait, as S approaches -infty, the cubic term dominates (7S^3), so tends to -infty,\n\nAt S= -1,\n\n-7 -6 +101+12= 100,\n\nSo between S=-2 and S=-1,\n\nAt S=-2,\n\n7*(-8) -6*4 -101*(-2)+12,\n\n-56 -24 +202 +12= 134,\n\nWait, no,\n\nWait S=-2,\n\n7*(-2)^3=7*(-8)= -56,\n\n-6*(-2)^2= -6*4= -24,\n\n-101*(-2)= 202,\n\n+12,\n\nTotal: -56-24+202+12= ( -80 +214)=134,\n\nAt S=-3,\n\n7*(-27)= -189,\n\n-6*(9)= -54,\n\n-101*(-3)=303,\n\n+12,\n\nTotal: -189-54+303+12= ( -243 +315)=72,\n\nAt S=-4,\n\n7*(-64)= -448,\n\n-6*(16)= -96,\n\n-101*(-4)=404,\n\n+12,\n\nTotal: -448-96+404+12= (-544 +416)= -128,\n\nSo between S=-4 and S=-3, the cubic goes from -128 to72, so crosses zero there,\n\nThus, three real roots: one between -4 and -3,\n\none between 4 and5,\n\nand one between -infty and... ?

So no new info.\n\nAlternatively, multiply all three equations:\n\n(a\u00b2 -b)(b\u00b2 -c)(c\u00b2 -a)=6^3=216,\n\nBut expanding this is complex.\n\nAlternatively, consider that this system is cyclic and perhaps can be transformed into equations involving S.\n\nLet me consider that:\n\nFrom equation1: b =a\u00b2 -6,\n\nEquation2: c =b\u00b2 -6 = (a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6,\n\nEquation3: a =c\u00b2 -6 = [(a\u00b2 -6)^2 -6]^2 -6,\n\nThis gives a single equation in a,\n\nBut expanding this would result in an eighth-degree equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a symmetry when a + b + c =0,\n\nLet me test S=0,\n\nThen P=(0 -0 -18)/2= -9,\n\nQ=0*(-9) -1= -1,\n\nThus the cubic equation is x\u00b3 +0x\u00b2 -9x +1=0 \u21d2x\u00b3 -9x +1=0,\n\nNot sure if this has roots satisfying the original equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two possible values are 6 and -6,\n\nBut I need to find another way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the equations:\n\na + b + c = S,\n\na\u00b2 = b +6,\n\nb\u00b2 =c +6,\n\nc\u00b2 =a +6.\n\nLet me consider the sum of the equations:\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S +18,\n\nAlso, the sum of the variables squared minus variables is 18.\n\nNow, consider the squares of the variables:\n\na\u00b2 =b +6,\n\nThen, (a\u00b2)^2 = (b +6)^2 \u21d2 a\u2074 = b\u00b2 +12b +36,\n\nBut b\u00b2 =c +6,\n\nThus,\n\na\u2074 = (c +6) +12b +36 \u21d2a\u2074 =c +12b +42,\n\nSimilarly, b\u2074 = a +12c +42,\n\nc\u2074 =b +12a +42,\n\nAdding all three,\n\na\u2074 +b\u2074 +c\u2074 =a +b +c +12(a +b +c) +126 \u21d2a\u2074 +b\u2074 +c\u2074 =13S +126,\n\nBut I'm not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute a\u2074 +b\u2074 +c\u2074,\n\nFrom a\u00b2 =b +6,\n\nSquare both sides: a\u2074 = (b +6)^2,\n\nSimilarly for others,\n\nThus,\n\na\u2074 +b\u2074 +c\u2074 = (b +6)^2 + (c +6)^2 + (a +6)^2,\n\nExpand:\n\n= b\u00b2 +12b +36 +c\u00b2 +12c +36 +a\u00b2 +12a +36,\n\n= (a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +12(a +b +c) +108,\n\n= (S +18) +12S +108,\n\n=13S +126,\n\nWhich matches the earlier result. So no new info.\n\nHmm,\n\nPerhaps the key is to notice that the system is symmetric and can be solved by assuming a + b + c = S,\n\nand then using the relationships to find S.\n\nFrom the equations:\n\na\u00b2 =b +6,\n\nb\u00b2 =c +6,\n\nc\u00b2 =a +6,\n\nLet me add them:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =a +b +c +18 \u21d2 a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = S +18,\n\nAlso, I can compute (a +b +c)^2 = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nThus,\n\nS\u00b2 = (S +18) + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nWhich gives:\n\nab + bc + ca = (S\u00b2 - S -18)/2,\n\nAlso, from the product of the variables,\n\na*b = ?\n\nWait",
