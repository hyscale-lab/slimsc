      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the percentage gain for the merchant. Hmm. Alright, so first, the problem says he bought 90 kg of oranges for 450 rupees. Then he sold the whole lot at 7.50 per kg. I need to calculate his percentage gain.\n\nLet me start by recalling the formula for percentage gain. I think it's [(Selling Price - Cost Price)/Cost Price] multiplied by 100. Yeah, that sounds right. So I need to find the selling price first, then subtract the cost price to get the profit, divide by cost, and multiply by 100 for the percentage.\n\nSo the cost price is given as 450 rupees for 90 kg. That part is straightforward. The selling price would be the total money he got from selling all 90 kg. Since he sold at 7.50 per kg, I can calculate that by multiplying 90 kg by 7.50.\n\nLet me compute the selling price first. 90 times 7.50. Hmm, 90 times 7 is 630, and 90 times 0.5 is 45. So adding those gives 630 +45 = 675. So the total selling price is 675 rupees.\n\nNow the cost price was 450. So the profit is 675 minus 450. Let me subtract that: 675 -450 = 225. So profit is 225 rupees.\n\nNow to find the percentage gain. The formula is (Profit / Cost Price)*100. So that would be (225 /450)*100. Let me compute that. 225 divided by 450 is 0.5. Multiply by 100 gives 50%. Wait, that would be 50%, which is option A. But let me check again, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. 225 divided by 450 is indeed 0.5. So 0.5 times 100 is 50%. Hmm. The options include 50% as option A. So that's the answer? But I thought maybe I messed up the calculations.\n\nWait, let me check the selling price again. 90 kg at 7.50 per kg. 90 *7.50. Let me do it another way. 7.50 multiplied by 90. 7.5 * 90. 7*90 is 630, 0.5*90 is 45. Total 675. Yes that's correct. Cost was 450. Profit is 225. So 225/450 is 0.5, so 50% gain. So the answer should be A) 50%.\n\nWait, but the options given include 50% as option A. So that must be correct. Maybe I overcomplicated, but I think that's right. Let me see if there's another way to think about it. Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me? Like per kg vs total? But no, the problem says he sold the whole lot at the rate of 7.50 per kg, so per kg is correct. So yeah, I think the answer is A.\n",
