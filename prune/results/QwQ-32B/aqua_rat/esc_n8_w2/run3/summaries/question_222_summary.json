      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this age problem. Hmm. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age and the remainder is divided by 18, then we get Rahul's present age. Then, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis is 5 years old. So first, I need to find Rahul's age, then work back to Ajay's age.\n\nWait, let's break it down step by step. Let's assign variables first. Let me denote Ajay's current age as A, Rahul's as R, and Denis's as D. \n\nThe first part says: (Ajay's age minus 6) divided by 18 equals Rahul's age. So the equation would be (A - 6)/18 = R. Got that.\n\nThen the second part: Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So R = D - 2. And Denis's age is given as 5. Wait, wait, the problem says \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" Oh right! So Denis is 5. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if Denis is 5, then Rahul is 5 minus 2? That would make Rahul 3? That seems really young, but maybe possible. Let me check again.\n\nWait the problem states: \"Rahul is 2 yrs younger to Denis whose age is 5 yrs.\" So yes, Denis is 5. So Rahul's age is 5 - 2 = 3 years old. \n\nSo substituting back into the first equation. So R is 3. Then (A -6)/18 = 3. To find A, multiply both sides by 18: A -6 = 3 * 18. Let's calculate that. 3 times 18 is 54. So A -6 =54. Then A =54 +6 =60. \n\nSo Ajay's age would be 60. Let me check the options. Option B is 60, so that's the answer. Wait, but let me double-check my steps. \n\nWait, Denis is 5. Rahul is 2 years younger, so 3. Then (A-6)/18 =3 \u2192 A-6=54 \u2192 A=60. That seems right. The options have B as 60, so that should be correct. \n\nHmm, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. Let me read again. \n\n\"If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained.\" Yes, so (A-6)/18 = R. \n\nThen Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. Denis's age is 5. So yes, R = D-2 \u2192 R =5-2=3. \n\nSo yes, all steps check out. So the answer is B)60. I don't see any mistakes here. The options given include B as 60, so that's the correct choice.\n",

Hmm, the problem has a few steps, so I should break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says: If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age and the remainder is divided by 18, then we get Rahul's present age. So let me write that as an equation. Let me denote Ajay's current age as A and Rahul's as R. Then the equation would be (A - 6)/18 = R. Got that part.\n\nThen the next part: Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. Wait, Denis's age is 5? Wait, that seems really young. Let me check again. Oh, the problem says \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs\". Oh, so Denis is 5 years old. So Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age would be Denis's age minus 2. So Denis is 5, so Rahul is 5 - 2 = 3 years old. Wait, that makes Rahul 3?\n\nPutting that together, since Rahul's age R is 3, then plugging back into the first equation. So (A -6)/18 = 3. To find A, multiply both sides by 18: A -6 = 54. Then add 6 to both sides: A = 60. So Ajay's age would be 60, which is option B. \n\nWait a second, but let me double-check because sometimes these age problems can be tricky. Let me confirm each step again. \n\nStarting with Denis: his age is given as 5. Rahul is 2 years younger, so 5 - 2 is indeed 3. Then the equation from the first part: (Ajay's age minus 6) divided by 18 equals Rahul's age. So (A-6)/18 = 3. Solving that gives A-6=54 \u2192 A=60. That seems right. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 60. So the answer should be B. I don't see any mistakes here. Maybe I misread the problem? Let me check again. \n\nThe problem states: \"If 6 yrs are subtracted from the present age of Ajay and the remainder is divided by 18, then the present age of Rahul is obtained.\" Yes, that's exactly how I set up the equation.
