      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about two trains leaving from the same place, Mumbai Central, heading to Lucknow. The question is asking when they'll meet each other. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down the details. Train A leaves at 11 am at 40 km/h. Train B leaves three hours later, at 2 pm, going faster at 72 km/h. I need to find the time when they meet.\n\nHmm, right, so when two objects are moving in the same direction, the relative speed is the difference between their speeds. Wait, but since they're on the same route going the same direction, that's correct. So the idea is that Train B is catching up to Train A. The time it takes for B to catch up would depend on how much distance A has already covered before B starts, and then the relative speed between them.\n\nLet me calculate how far Train A has gone by the time Train B starts. From 11 am to 2 pm is three hours. So in those three hours, Train A is moving at 40 km/h. So distance covered by A in that time is 40 * 3 = 120 km. So when Train B starts at 2 pm, Train A is already 120 km ahead.\n\nNow, the question is, how long will it take for Train B to cover that 120 km gap, considering that both are moving. Since B is faster, the relative speed is (72 - 40) km/h. Let me compute that: 72 minus 40 is 32 km/h. So the gap is closing at 32 km per hour.\n\nTo cover 120 km at 32 km/h, the time needed would be time = distance / speed. So that's 120 / 32. Let me calculate that. 32 times 3 is 96, subtract that from 120 gives 24. 24 divided by 32 is 0.75. So total time is 3.75 hours. Wait, 3.75 hours is 3 hours and 45 minutes. Because 0.75 of an hour is 45 minutes (since 0.75*60=45).\n\nSo starting from 2 pm, adding 3 hours and 45 minutes. Let's see: 2 pm plus 3 hours is 5 pm, plus 45 minutes brings it to 5:45 pm. Hmm, but none of the options are 5:45 pm. The options are 12 am, 5 am, 5 pm, 2 pm, or none. So that suggests maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me recalculate the time. 120 divided by 32. Let me do that division again. 32 \u00d7 3.75 is 32\u00d73=96, plus 32\u00d70.75=24. 96+24=120. That's correct. So the time is indeed 3.75 hours, which is 3h45m. So starting at 2 pm, adding 3h45m would be 5:45 pm. But the options don't have that. Hmm. The options given are A)12 am next day, B)5 am next day, C)5 pm next day, D)2 pm next day. So none of these are 5:45 pm. Wait, so maybe I messed up the initial steps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up equations for their positions over time and see when they meet. Let me try that approach again.\n\nLet me denote the time since Train A left as t hours. Then, the position of Train A is 40*t. Train B leaves 3 hours later, so its time since departure when Train A's time is t would be (t - 3) hours. So the position of Train B would be 72*(t - 3). But they meet when their positions are equal. So:\n\n40t = 72(t - 3)\n\nLet me solve that equation. Expand the right side: 72t - 216. So:\n\n40t = 72t - 216\n\nSubtract 40t from both sides: 0 = 32t - 216\n\n32t = 216 \u2192 t = 216 /32. Let me compute that. 32\u00d76 is 192, so 216-192=24, so 6 + 24/32 = 6.75 hours. So t is 6.75 hours after 11 am.\n\nWait a second! Oh, here's the problem. Earlier, when I considered the time from 2 pm, I might have made a mistake. Let's see. The first approach considered the time since 2 pm, but the second approach here is using t as the time since 11 am. So let's clarify:\n\nThe first method where I calculated 3.75 hours from 2 pm gives the meeting time as 5:45 pm, but according to the equation, t is 6.75 hours after 11 am. Let me convert 6.75 hours to hours and minutes. 6 hours is 6 hours, and 0.75 hours is 45 minutes. So 11 am + 6h45m is 5:45 pm. That matches the first method. So the meeting time is 5:45 pm. But the options given do not include that. The closest is option C)5 pm next day? Wait, no, 5 pm the same day. Wait, the options are:\n\nA)12 am next day,\n\nB)5 am next day,\n\nC)5 pm next day,\n\nD)2 pm next day,\n\nE)None of these.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the next day\" for options A, B, D. Wait, but 5:45 pm is on the same day as departure. Because the trains left on the same day. So the meeting time is on the same day. So the options given don't have 5:45 pm. So that means the correct answer is E) None of these. Because the options don't include the correct time. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the equations again.\n\nLet me denote the time after 2 pm when they meet as T hours. So from 2 pm, the time taken until meeting is T hours. In that time, Train B has been traveling for T hours, and Train A has been traveling for T + 3 hours (since it started 3 hours earlier). \n\nSo the distance covered by A is 40*(T + 3), and distance by B is 72*T. When they meet, these distances are equal.\n\nSo equation: 40(T + 3) = 72T\n\nExpanding: 40T + 120 =72T\n\nSubtract 40T: 120 =32T \u2192 T=120/32 = 3.75 hours. Which is 3h45m. So starting at 2 pm, adding 3h45m gives 5:45 pm, which is the same as before.\n\nSo the answer isn't listed in the options A-D, so the correct choice is E) None of these. So the answer is E.\n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)12 am next day,\n\nB)5 am next day,\n\nC)5 pm next day,\n\nD)2 pm next day,\n\nE)None of these.\n\nYes, so 5:45 pm is not listed. So the correct answer is E. Therefore, the answer must be E.\n",

Train B leaves later, at 2 pm, but it's faster at 72 kmph. The question is asking when they'll meet. Hmm, I need to figure out the time they meet.\n\nLet me think. Since they're going the same route, Train A has a head start. From 11 am to 2 pm is three hours. So in those three hours, how far did Train A go? Well, 40 km per hour times 3 hours would be 120 km. So when Train B starts at 2 pm, Train A is already 120 km ahead.\n\nNow, after 2 pm, both trains are moving. But Train B is going faster, so it's catching up. The relative speed between them would be the difference in their speeds. Since they're moving in the same direction, subtract the slower from the faster. So 72 minus 40 is 32 km per hour. That means every hour after 2 pm, Train B is closing the gap by 32 km.\n\nThe initial distance between them is 120 km. To find the time it takes to close that gap at 32 km/h, I can divide the distance by the relative speed. So 120 divided by 32. Let me calculate that. 32 times 3 is 96, and 32 times 3.75 would be 120.
