      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this mixture problem. Hmm, the question is about replacing part of a mixture to change the proportions. The initial mixture is 10 kg, with 30% sand and 70% clay. We need to make it so that the mixture has equal parts sand and clay. So, the goal is 50% each. \n\nWait, how do you approach such problems? I remember something about removing a portion and replacing it. The key here is that when you remove some of the mixture, you're taking out both sand and clay in their current proportions. Then, adding pure sand would change the composition.\n\nLet me think step by step. Let's denote the amount to be removed and replaced as x kg. Since the total mixture is 10 kg, removing x kg leaves (10 - x) kg. The remaining mixture still has the original proportions, so the amount of sand left would be 30% of (10 - x), and clay would be 70% of (10 - x). Then, when we add x kg of pure sand, the total sand becomes (0.3*(10 -x) + x) and the clay remains 0.7*(10 -x). \n\nWait, because when we remove x kg of the mixture, the sand and clay in that x kg are 0.3x and 0.7x respectively. So after removal, the remaining sand is original sand (3 kg) minus 0.3x, and clay is 7 kg minus 0.7x. Then adding x kg of sand would make the total sand (3 -0.3x +x) and clay (7 -0.7x). The total mixture is still 10 kg because we took out x and added back x.\n\nWe need the final amounts of sand and clay to be equal. So set their expressions equal:\n\n3 -0.3x +x = 7 -0.7x \n\nLet me compute that equation step by step. Let me rewrite the equation:\n\n(3 + 0.7x) = (7 -0.7x)\n\nWait, because 3 -0.3x +x is 3 +0.7x. And the clay is 7 -0.7x. So setting them equal:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x \n\nCombine like terms. Let's add 0.7x to both sides:\n\n3 + 1.4x =7 \n\nThen subtract 3:\n\n1.4x =4 \n\nx =4 /1.4 \n\nHmm, 4 divided by 1.4. Let me compute that. 1.4 is 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4*(10/14) =40/14 =20/7. Which is approximately 2.857 kg. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 20/7, so that's the answer. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe using the concept of concentration. Let me see. The initial amount of sand is 3 kg (30% of 10 kg), clay is 7 kg. We want them to be equal, so each should be 5 kg. So we need to add sand and remove clay? Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the way to think is that when you remove x kg of the mixture, you are taking out (0.3x sand and 0.7x clay). Then adding x kg of sand. So the new sand is (3 -0.3x +x) =3 +0.7x. The clay is (7 -0.7x). Setting equal:\n\n3 +0.7x =7 -0.7x \u2192 same equation as before. So solving gives x=20/7. That matches. So the answer must be B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem where there's a 10kg mixture of sand and clay. Right now, 30% is sand and 70% clay. The question is asking how much of this mixture needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand so that the final mixture has equal parts sand and clay. Hmm, so the goal is to get 50% sand and 50% clay.\n\nAlright, so first, maybe I should figure out how much sand and clay are in the original mixture. Let's do that. The total is 10kg. 30% sand would be 0.3*10 = 3kg of sand. And 70% clay is 7kg. Got that down.\n\nNow, the problem is about removing some amount of the mixture and replacing it with pure sand. Let me think. When you remove a portion of the mixture, you're taking out both sand and clay in the same ratio they're present. Then, adding pure sand will increase the sand content. The key here is to figure out how much to remove so that after replacement, the sand and clay are equal.\n\nLet me denote the amount to be removed and replaced as x kg. So, the plan is: remove x kg of the mixture, which has 30% sand and 70% clay, then add x kg of pure sand. The total mass remains 10kg, right? Because you take out x and put back x.\n\nFirst, let's compute the amount of sand and clay after removal and before adding the new sand. When we remove x kg of the mixture, the amount of sand removed would be 0.3x, and clay removed is 0.7x. So the remaining sand is original sand minus removed sand: 3 - 0.3x. Similarly, remaining clay is 7 - 0.7x. Then, we add x kg of pure sand. So the total sand after replacement is (3 - 0.3x) + x. The clay remains at (7 - 0.7x), since we didn't add any clay.\n\nWe want the final amounts of sand and clay to be equal. So:\n\nSand after = Clay after\n\nSo:\n\n(3 - 0.3x) + x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\n3 - 0.3x + x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nCombine like terms on the left side:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nHmm, okay. Now, let's get all the x terms on one side and constants on the other. Let's add 0.7x to both sides:\n\n3 + 0.7x + 0.7x = 7\n\nWhich becomes:\n\n3 + 1.4x =7\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n1.4x = 4\n\nThen x = 4 / 1.4\n\nHmm, 4 divided by 1.4. Let's compute that. 1.4 is the same as 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4*(10/14) = 40/14 = 20/7. Wait, 40 divided by 14 reduces to 20/7. Oh, so that's 20/7 kg. Let me check the options. Option B is 20/7, so that would be the answer?\n\nWait, let me verify again. Let's go through the steps once more to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal sand: 3kg, clay 7kg.\n\nAfter removing x kg of mixture: the sand removed is 0.3x, so remaining sand is 3 -0.3x. Clay remaining is 7 -0.7x. Then adding x kg sand: total sand becomes (3 -0.3x +x) = 3 +0.7x. Clay is 7-0.7x.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n3 +0.7x =7 -0.7x\n\nAdding 0.7x to both sides: 3 +1.4x =7 \u2192 1.4x=4 \u2192 x=4/1.4.\n\nYes, 4 divided by 1.4. 1.4 is 14/10, so 4/(14/10)=4*(10/14)=40/14=20/7. That's correct. So option B is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of another way to approach it. Let me see.\n\nAnother method: The idea is that when you remove and replace, the concentration of clay will decrease. We need to get to 50% clay and 50% sand. Wait, original clay is 70%, so we want to reduce it to 50%. The process of removing mixture and replacing with pure sand will reduce the amount of clay.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of mass balance for clay.\n\nThe final amount of clay should be 5kg (since total is 10kg, so 50% is 5kg). The initial clay is 7kg. The amount of clay removed when we take out x kg of the mixture is 0.7x. Since we are not adding any clay back, the final clay is 7 - 0.7x =5. So solving for x:\n\n7 -0.7x =5 \u2192 0.7x =2 \u2192 x =2/0.7 =20/7. Same result. Yep, that works. So that confirms it again.\n\nSo the answer must be B)20/7.\n",
