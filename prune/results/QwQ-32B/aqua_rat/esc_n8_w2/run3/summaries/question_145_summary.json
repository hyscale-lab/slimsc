      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is asking about the ratio of the volume of a cube to the volume of the largest sphere that can fit inside it. Hmm, let me think. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize this. The sphere has to fit perfectly inside the cube, right? So the sphere must touch the cube exactly at the centers of each face. That means the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. Oh right, because if the sphere is the largest possible, its diameter can't be longer than the cube's edge. So if the cube has an edge length of, say, 'a', then the sphere's diameter is 'a', so the radius would be a/2.\n\nNow, the volume of the cube is straightforward: it's edge length cubed, so V_cube = a\u00b3.\n\nThe volume of the sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Substituting the radius as a/2, so that becomes (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)\u00b3. Let me compute that. \n\nLet me write it out step by step. The radius is a/2, so the sphere's volume is (4/3)\u03c0*(a\u00b3/8). Because (a/2)^3 is a\u00b3/8. Then multiplying that by 4/3 gives (4/3)*(\u03c0)*(a\u00b3/8). Let me compute the constants: 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so 4/(3*8) is 1/(6). Wait, 4/3 times 1/8 is 4/(24), which simplifies to 1/6. So the sphere's volume is (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6. \n\nSo now the ratio of cube's volume to sphere's volume is a\u00b3 divided by (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6). The a\u00b3 terms cancel out, so it's 1 divided by (\u03c0/6) which is 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6:\u03c0. Let me check the options again. Option D is 6:\u03c0, so that must be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. The question says cube to sphere. So cube volume is a\u00b3, sphere is (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6. So the ratio is (a\u00b3) / (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6) = 6/\u03c0. So yes, 6:\u03c0. So D is correct. \n\nLooking at the options again: A is 2:\u03c0, which is smaller. B is 7:2, which is like 3.5, but 6/\u03c0 is roughly 1.9, so that's not. Option C is 8:2 which simplifies to 4:1, which is way off. E is 8:3, which is about 2.666, but 6/\u03c0 is approximately 1.909. So D is the only one that matches the calculation. I think that's right. Maybe I made a mistake in the sphere volume formula? Let me check again. The formula is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. So with radius a/2, so cubed is (a^3)/8. Multiply by 4/3 gives 4/(24) \u03c0 a\u00b3, which is 1/6 \u03c0 a\u00b3. Yep. So the ratio is indeed 6/\u03c0, so D is correct.\n",
