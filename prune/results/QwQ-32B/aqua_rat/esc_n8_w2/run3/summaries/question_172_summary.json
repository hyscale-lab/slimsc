      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Christopher and Jonathan flipping a coin 20 times. The rules are that if it lands on heads, Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan, and if it's tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher. After 20 flips, neither of them has won or lost any money. The question is asking how many times the coin landed on heads. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, right. So I need to set up an equation here. Let's think. Let me denote the number of heads as H and tails as T. Since there are 20 flips total, H + T = 20. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the money part. For each head, Christopher loses $2 (so Jonathan gains $2), and for each tail, Jonathan loses $3 (so Christopher gains $3). Since in the end, the total is a wash\u2014no net gain or loss\u2014the total amount Christopher loses must equal the total he gains. Alternatively, the total amount Jonathan gains must equal what he loses. Either way, the net should be zero.\n\nLet me think in terms of Christopher's perspective. Each head: he gives $2, so that's a loss of 2 per head. Each tail: he receives $3, so that's a gain of +3 per tail. The total change for him is (3*T) - (2*H) = 0, because there's no net gain or loss. \n\nAlternatively, since H + T =20, maybe substitute T =20 - H into the equation.\n\nSo let's write that equation out. \n\nThe total money Christopher gains from tails is 3*T. The total he loses from heads is 2*H. The net is zero, so 3*T - 2*H =0. \n\nBut since T is 20 - H, substituting that in:\n\n3*(20 - H) - 2*H =0 \n\nLet me compute that step by step. \n\n3*(20 - H) is 60 -3H. Then subtract 2H, so 60 -3H -2H = 60 -5H. \n\nSet equal to zero: 60 -5H =0 \u2192 5H =60 \u2192 H=12. \n\nWait, so H would be 12. Let me check that again. \n\nSo substituting H =12, then T is 8. \n\nCheck the math: \n\nHeads: 12 times. So Christopher loses 12 *2 = $24. \n\nTails:8 times. He gains 8*3= $24. So 24-24=0. That works. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 12. So the answer should be E. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)10, B)23 (which can't be, since total flips are 20), C)16, D)18, E)12. So yes, E is 12. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me see another approach. \n\nJonathan's perspective: each head he gains $2, each tail he loses $3. So his total is 2H -3T =0. \n\nSame equation, since H + T =20. So 2H -3(20 -H)=0 \u2192 2H -60 +3H =0 \u21925H -60=0 \u21925H=60 \u2192H=12. Yep, same result. So that's right. \n\nSo the answer is E)12.\n",
