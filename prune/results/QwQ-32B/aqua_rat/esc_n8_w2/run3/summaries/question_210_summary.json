      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about Shweta riding at 10 km per hour but stopping for 10 minutes every 15 km. We need to find out how long it takes her to cover 100 km. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I should break down the problem. Let's see. She rides 15 km, then stops for 10 minutes. Then repeats that. So the total distance is 100 km. I need to calculate both the time she spends moving and the time she spends resting.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many 15 km segments there are in 100 km. Dividing 100 by 15 gives... let's see. 15 times 6 is 90, so 6 segments of 15 km would be 90 km. Then there's 10 km left. Wait, but does she stop after every 15 km? So after the first 15 km, she stops, then after the next 15, etc. But after the last segment, maybe she doesn't need to stop? Because once she reaches the destination, she might not take a break. That's an important point.\n\nSo for the 100 km, how many stops does she make? Let's think. Each 15 km segment is followed by a stop except maybe the last one. So if she does 6 segments of 15 km (total 90 km), then the last 10 km is the 7th segment, but she might not stop after that. Wait, no, the last segment is 10 km, which isn't a full 15. So the number of stops would be the number of completed 15 km intervals before the end. \n\nWait, perhaps better to think of it as for every 15 km, except the last one if it doesn't reach. Let me see:\n\nTotal distance: 100 km.\n\nNumber of 15 km intervals: Let's see, 100 divided by 15. 15*6=90, so 6 intervals, with 10 km remaining. So she does 6 intervals of 15 km, each followed by a 10-minute break, except maybe the last one. Wait, no, actually, the breaks come after completing each 15 km. So after the first 15 km, she stops. Then after the next 15 (total 30), stops again, etc. So after each 15 km segment, she stops. But when she does the last 10 km, that's not a full 15, so she wouldn't stop after that. Therefore, the number of breaks is equal to the number of completed 15 km segments. \n\nSo for 6 segments of 15 km (total 90 km), each followed by a break, that's 6 breaks. Then the remaining 10 km is done without a break after. So total breaks: 6 times 10 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me think of it as:\n\nEach time she completes 15 km, she takes a break. So after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km, she stops. That's 6 stops. Then the last 10 km (from 90 to 100) she does without stopping. So yes, 6 breaks. Each break is 10 minutes. So total break time is 6*10 = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nNow, the moving time. She rides 100 km at 10 km/h. Wait, but actually, her speed is 10 km per hour, so time moving is total distance divided by speed. But wait, that would be 100 /10 = 10 hours. But then adding the breaks. Wait, but that might be the case if there were no breaks, but with breaks, the total time would be moving time plus break time. \n\nWait, but let me verify again. The moving time: each segment of 15 km takes how long? Since her speed is 10 km/h, time per 15 km is 15/10 = 1.5 hours (which is 1 hour 30 minutes). So for each 15 km segment, it takes 1.5 hours. \n\nSo for the first 6 segments (each 15 km, total 90 km), each takes 1.5 hours, so 6*1.5 = 9 hours of moving time. Then the last 10 km: 10 km at 10 km/h is 1 hour. So total moving time is 9 +1 = 10 hours. \n\nThen the breaks: 6 stops, each 10 minutes: 6*10=60 minutes = 1 hour. So total time is 10 +1 = 11 hours. So that would be answer C) 11 hours.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think step by step again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should compute each segment with its break and then the last part.\n\nFirst segment: 15 km. Time moving: 1.5 hours. Then 10 minutes break. \n\nSecond segment: another 15 km (total 30), moving time another 1.5, then break. \n\nThis repeats until the sixth 15 km segment (total 90 km). Then the last 10 km.\n\nSo for each of the 6 segments (each 15 km):\n\nEach has 1.5 hours moving + 0.1667 hours (10 min) break, except the last one (the 6th segment's break is still taken after the 90 km). Wait, no, the break after each 15 km. So after the sixth 15 km (90 km), she takes a break. Then she has to do the remaining 10 km, which is after the break.\n\nWait, so after the sixth segment (90 km), she takes the 10-minute break. Then she proceeds to ride the remaining 10 km, which takes 1 hour, with no break after that. \n\nSo the breaks are all after each 15 km. So the total breaks are 6, each 10 minutes, so 60 minutes. \n\nSo moving time:\n\n6 segments of 15 km: 6 * 1.5 hours = 9 hours. \n\nThen the last 10 km: 1 hour. Total moving time: 10 hours. \n\nBreak time: 1 hour. \n\nTotal time 11 hours. So that would be option C.\n\nHmm. Let me see if there's another way someone might miscalculate. Like, maybe someone might think that after the last 15 km segment (the sixth one, 90 km), you need to add the break before the final 10 km? Which would still be correct here. So yes, the break is part of the total time. So 6 breaks.\n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that after every 15 km except the last, but in this case, the last 15 km is part of the 90, so the 6th break is after 90 km, then you have to take that break before doing the last 10. So that is accounted for. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could miscalculate the number of breaks. Let's see: 100 km divided by 15 is 6 and 2/3. So the number of breaks would be the integer part, which is 6. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that she stops after every 15 km, so after 15, 30,..., 90, 105? Wait no, she stops when she completes 15 km segments. Since she stops at the end of every 15 km. So at 15, 30,...,90. So 6 stops. \n\nTherefore, the total time is 11 hours. So the answer should be C.\n",

She rides 100 km at 10 km/h. Wait, but actually, her speed is 10 km per hour, so time moving is total distance divided by speed. But wait, that would be 100 /10 = 10 hours.

So for each 15 km segment, it takes 1.5 hours. \n\nSo for the first 6 segments (each 15 km, total 90 km), each takes 1.5 hours, so 6*1.5 = 9 hours of moving time.

So first, I should figure out how many stops she makes and then add that to the total travel time.\n\nWait, let's break it down. The total distance is 100 km. She stops after every 15 km. So how many 15 km segments are in 100 km? Let me divide 100 by 15. 15 times 6 is 90, so that's 6 segments of 15 km, and then there's 10 km left. Wait, so she would stop after each 15 km except the last one? Because once she finishes the 100 km, she doesn't need to stop anymore. So the number of rest stops would be the number of completed 15 km intervals before reaching 100 km. Let me think again: after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90 km, she stops. The next segment would be 100-90=10 km, so after that she's done. So that's 6 stops? Wait no, wait. Because after each 15 km she stops. So after the first 15 km, then after next 15 (total 30), etc. So for the 6 segments (each 15 km except maybe the last), the number of stops would be 6? Wait, but when she completes the 90 km, she stops again. Then she has 10 km left. So after the 90, she stops again, then continues. Wait, no. Wait, the problem says she stops at the end of every 15 km. So after every 15 km segment. So after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, but when she reaches 100, she doesn't stop because that's the end. So how many stops? Let's see:\n\nEach 15 km segment after which she stops, except the last part if it's less than 15. So the total number of stops would be the integer division of (total distance / 15) minus 1? Or maybe not. Wait let me count again. Let's see:\n\nShe starts at 0 km. After 15 km, first stop. Then another 15 (total 30), second stop. Then 45, third. 60, fourth. 75, fifth. 90, sixth. Then the next part is 10 km, so she doesn't stop again after that because that's the end. So total stops are 6. Each stop is 10 minutes. So total rest time is 6 * 10 = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nNow, the total time moving. She has to cover 100 km. Her speed is 10 km/h, so time moving is 100 / 10 = 10 hours. Then adding the rest time of 1 hour gives 11 hours total? Wait, but wait, let me confirm again.\n\nWait, the moving time is indeed 10 hours. Then the stops: 6 stops at 10 minutes each. 6*10=60 minutes = 1 hour. Total is 10 +1 = 11. So the answer would be C)11 hours?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me think step by step. Let's see how much time each segment takes.\n\nEach 15 km segment takes 15 km / 10 km/h = 1.5 hours. Then she stops for 10 minutes. Except after the last segment, which might be shorter. Wait, the last segment is 10 km, so that's different.\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate the time for each segment plus the stops. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, how many full 15 km segments are there?\n\n100 divided by 15 is 6 with a remainder of 10. So 6 segments of 15 km and one of 10 km.\n\nEach 15 km segment takes 1.5 hours (since 15/10 = 1.5). Then after each of those 6 segments, she takes a 10-minute break.\n\nThe last 10 km segment takes 10/10 = 1 hour, and no break after that.\n\nSo total moving time: 6 * 1.5 + 1 = 9 +1 = 10 hours.\n\nTotal rest time: 6 stops * 10 minutes = 60 minutes = 1 hour.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 = 11 hours. So yes, that's C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the stops. Let me think again. Let me count each segment and stop step by step.\n\nFirst 15 km: 1.5 hours. Then 10 min rest. Total so far: 1.5 + 0.166... (10 minutes) = 1.666...\n\nSecond 15 km (total 30 km): another 1.5 hours, then rest. So after two segments, that's 3 hours moving, plus 2 rests (20 min). So total 3 + 0.333... = 3.333... hours.\n\nContinuing this way might be tedious, but let's see for all 6 segments and the last part.\n\nWait, perhaps better to see:\n\nTotal moving time for 100 km is 10 hours, as before. The stops are after each 15 km except the last. So the number of stops is equal to the number of completed 15 km intervals. Since she does 6 intervals of 15 (total 90 km), then the last 10.

Then after each of those 6 segments, she takes a 10-minute break.\n\nThe last 10 km segment takes 10/10 = 1 hour, and no break after that.\n\nSo total moving time: 6 * 1.5 + 1 = 9 +1 = 10 hours.\n\nTotal rest time: 6 stops * 10 minutes = 60 minutes = 1 hour.\n\nTotal time: 10 + 1 = 11 hours. So yes, that's C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the stops. Let me think again. Let me count each segment and stop step by step.\n\nFirst 15 km: 1.5 hours. Then 10 min rest. Total so far: 1.5 + 0.166... (10 minutes) = 1.666...\n\nSecond 15 km (total 30 km): another 1.5 hours, then rest. So after two segments, that's 3 hours moving, plus 2 rests (20 min). So total 3 + 0.333... = 3.333... hours.\n\nContinuing this way might be tedious, but let's see for all 6 segments and the last part.\n\nWait, perhaps better to see:\n\nTotal moving time for 100 km is 10 hours, as before. The stops are after each 15 km except the last. So the number of stops is equal to the number of completed 15 km intervals. Since she does 6 intervals of 15 (total 90 km), then the last 10. So 6 stops. So 6*10 minutes = 1 hour. So total time is 10+1=11. That seems right.\n\nSo the answer is C)11 hours. So the correct option is C.\n\n\nTo determine the total time Shweta takes to cover 100 km, we first calculate her travel time and rest stops. \n\n**Travel Time Calculation:**\n- Shweta rides at 10 km/h. The total distance is 100 km.\n- Time spent moving = Total distance / Speed = 100 km / 10 km/h = **10 hours**.\n\n**Rest Stops Calculation:**\n- She stops for 10 minutes after every 15 km. \n- The number of 15 km segments in 100 km is calculated by dividing 100 by 15, which gives 6 full segments (15 km each) and a remaining 10 km. \n- Since she stops after each 15 km segment except the final one (when she reaches 100 km), the number of stops is **6**.\n- Total rest time = 6 stops \u00d7 10 minutes = **60 minutes (1 hour)**.\n\n**Total Time:**\n- Travel time (10 hours) + Rest time (1 hour) = **11 hours**.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C) 11 hours**.\n\nAnswer: C",
