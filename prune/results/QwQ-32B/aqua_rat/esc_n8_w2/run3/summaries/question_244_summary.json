      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this percentage problem. The question is: If m is greater than 0, y is greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then m is what percentage of x? The answer has to be in terms of y, and the options are given. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the information. The problem states that x is m percent of 4y. So, translating that into an equation. Remember that \"percent\" means per hundred. So, m percent would be m/100. \n\nSo, x equals (m/100) times 4y. Let me write that out:\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y.\n\nSimplify that equation. Let me compute 4y multiplied by m/100. That would be (4m*y)/100. So, x = (4m y)/100. Alternatively, that's (m y)/25. Wait, 4 divided by 100 is 1/25, right? Because 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, and 1/25 is 0.04. So, yeah, x = (m y)/25.\n\nBut the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So, they want to know, m is what percent of x? Let me think. The standard way to phrase that is: if I have to find what percentage A is of B, the formula is (A/B)*100%. So here, m is what percentage of x? That would be (m/x)*100%.\n\nSo, the answer would be (m/x)*100%, but expressed in terms of y. So I need to express this in terms of y. Since we have x in terms of m and y, maybe we can rearrange the equation to solve for m in terms of x and y first, then plug into the percentage formula?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to first solve for m in terms of x and y, then compute the percentage. Let me try both approaches.\n\nStarting with the first equation: x = (4m y)/100. Let's solve for m. Multiply both sides by 100: 100x = 4m y. Then, divide both sides by 4y: m = (100x)/(4y) = (25x)/y. \n\nWait, so m is (25x)/y. Now, the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So that's (m/x)*100%. Let's substitute m here with (25x)/y. \n\nSo substituting m: [(25x/y)/x] * 100%. The x cancels out here. So (25/y) * 100% equals (2500/y)%. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is 2500/y. So that would be the answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra.\n\nAlternatively, let me try the other approach. Let's compute (m/x)*100% using the original equation. \n\nWe have x = (4m y)/100. So m/x = m/( (4m y)/100 ) = m * 100/(4m y) ). The m cancels here, so it's 100/(4y) = 25/y. Then multiply by 100% gives (25/y)*100% = 2500/y %. \n\nSame result. So that's correct. So the answer should be D. Let me check the options again: \n\nA)y/400 \u2014 nope, that's way too small. \n\nB)4y \u2014 units? If y is a variable, maybe not. \n\nC)50y \u2014 that would be bigger, but according to the calculation, it's 2500/y. \n\nD)2500/y \u2014 yes. \n\nE)5000/y \u2014 that's double of D. Wait, where did I get 25/y * 100? Wait, let me recheck that step again. \n\nWait, when I computed (m/x)*100%:\n\nOriginal equation x = (4m y)/100 \u2192 m/x = (m) / (4m y /100) \u2192 m divided by that fraction is m multiplied by 100/(4m y). \n\nYes, the m's cancel, so 100/(4y). 100 divided by 4 is 25, so 25/y. Then multiplying by 100% gives (25/y)*100% = 2500/y %.\n\nAh, right, so 25/y times 100% equals 2500 divided by y, so D is the correct option. \n\nHmm, okay, so I think D is the right answer here. Let me just think of a numerical example to verify. Suppose, for instance, let me pick numbers. Let me choose y = 10 and m = 50. \n\nThen x is m% of 4y. So 4y is 40. m% is 50%, so x would be 50% of 40, which is 20. \n\nNow, the question is: m is what percentage of x? m is 50, x is 20. So (50/20)*100% = 250%. \n\nNow, substituting y=10 into the options: \n\nD is 2500/10 = 250, so 250%. Which matches. \n\nE would be 5000/10 =500%, which is too big. \n\nSo yes, D works here. \n\nAnother example: Let y = 25. Let me pick m such that calculations are easy. Let's say m is 100. \n\nThen 4y is 100, so m% of that would be 100% of 100, so x is 100. \n\nSo m is 100, x is 100. Then m is 100% of x. \n\nNow, according to the formula, D would be 2500/25 = 100, so 100%, which matches. \n\nAnother test: Let y = 50. Suppose m is 25. \n\nThen 4y is 200. 25% of 200 is 50, so x is 50. \n\nm is 25, x is 50. So m is 50% of x. \n\nUsing the formula, D: 2500/50 = 50. So 50%, which matches. \n\nHmm, that all checks out. So the answer must be D.\n",
