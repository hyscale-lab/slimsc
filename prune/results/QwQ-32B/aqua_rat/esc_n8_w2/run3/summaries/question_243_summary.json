      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21, then find the number. The options are A)84, B)66, C)28, D)19, E)11. Hmm, let's see how to approach this. \n\nAlright, let me break it down step by step. The problem says \"one third of 3/4 of a number is 21.\" So I need to translate that into an equation. Let me call the number we're looking for \"x\". \n\nFirst, let's parse the wording. The phrase \"3/4 of a number\" would be (3/4)*x. Then, \"one third of that\" would be (1/3) multiplied by that 3/4x. So putting it all together, the equation would be (1/3)*(3/4)*x = 21. \n\nWait, let me make sure I got the order right. The problem says \"one third of 3/4 of a number.\" Yeah, that's correct. So the operations are in that order. So multiplying those fractions first: (1/3) * (3/4) is... let's see, the 3s might cancel out. Because 1/3 times 3/4, the 3 in numerator and denominator cancels, leaving 1/4. So that simplifies to (1/4)*x =21. \n\nOh, that's a nice simplification. So (1/4)x =21. To find x, I just multiply both sides by 4. So x=21*4. Let me calculate that. 21 times 4 is 84. So the number should be 84, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again. Let me write the equation again step by step. \n\nLet the number be x. \n\n3/4 of the number is (3/4)x. \n\nThen one third of that is (1/3)*(3/4)x. \n\nMultiplying those fractions: (1/3)*(3/4) = (3)/(12) = 1/4. So yes, that's 1/4 x. \n\nSet that equal to 21: (1/4)x =21. Multiply both sides by 4: x =21*4=84. \n\nHmm, so that's straightforward. Then why are there other options? Let me see if maybe I misread the problem. \n\nWait, the problem says \"one third of 3/4 of a number is 21.\" So yes, that's exactly what I did. So the answer should be 84, which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might misinterpret the wording. Like, maybe \"one third of 3/4\" is different? But no, the way it's phrased, it's one third multiplied by 3/4 of the number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps someone might reverse the order? Like 3/4 of one third? But that would be different. Let me see. If the problem had said \"3/4 of one third of a number,\" then that would be (3/4)*(1/3)x, which is also (1/4)x, same result. Wait, actually, in that case, the same. Because multiplication is commutative. So (1/3)*(3/4) is same as (3/4)*(1/3). So regardless of the order, it's 1/4. \n\nHmm, so maybe the answer is indeed A. Let me check the options again. Option A is 84, which matches my calculation. \n\nWait, but let me think if there's another way someone could approach it wrong. Suppose someone thought that \"one third of 3/4\" is adding fractions? Like 1/3 + 3/4? No, that doesn't make sense. Or maybe they thought it's 3/4 divided by 1/3, which would be multiplying by reciprocal, so 3/4 *3, but that would be different. Wait, perhaps someone might have set up the equation incorrectly. \n\nWait, the problem says \"one third of 3/4 of a number is 21.\" So equation is (1/3)*(3/4)x =21. If someone instead thought it was (3/4) divided by (1/3) equals 21, then that would be different. Let's see. If they did (3/4)x / (1/3) =21, that would be (3/4)x *3 =21, so (9/4)x=21, then x=21*(4/9)= 84/9 \u22489.333, which isn't even an option. So that's probably not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might have messed up the order of operations. Let me see. Let's try plugging in the options to check. \n\nIf the number is 84 (option A), then 3/4 of 84 is (3/4)*84 = 63. Then one third of that is 63/3 =21. Which matches exactly the problem's statement. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nLet me check another option just to be sure. Let's say option C is 28. Then 3/4 of 28 is 21. Then one third of 21 is 7, which is not 21, so that's wrong. \n\nOption B is 66. 3/4 of 66 is (3/4)*66 = 49.5, then one third of that is 16.5, which isn't 21. \n\nD is 19. 3/4 of 19 is 14.25, divided by 3 is ~4.75. Not 21. E is 11: 3/4 of 11 is 8.25, divided by 3 is ~2.75. Nope. \n\nSo only option A gives the correct result. Therefore, the answer must be A)84.\n",
