      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so here's this problem about two ants moving towards each other. Let me see. Ant A is going 9 cm per hour, and Ant B is 6 cm per hour. The distance between their farms is 75 cm. I need to find out how far Ant A travels before they meet. Hmm, right.\n\nAlright, first thought: when two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up. So the time it takes for them to meet should be the total distance divided by the sum of their speeds. That makes sense. Let me think again. So total distance is 75 cm. The combined speed is 9 + 6 = 15 cm/h. So time until meeting would be 75 divided by 15. That's 5 hours. Wait, yeah, because 15 times 5 is 75. \n\nOnce I have the time, then the distance Ant A travels is just its speed multiplied by that time. So Ant A's speed is 9 cm/h, so 9 * 5 = 45 cm. That would be option A. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check. Let's see: if Ant A goes 45 cm in 5 hours, then Ant B would go 6 *5 =30 cm. 45+30=75, which is exactly the distance between them. So that adds up. So the answer must be 45, which is option A. \n\nHmm, but wait, the options given are A)45, B)48, etc. So yeah, A is the first option. I think that's right. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. \n\nTotal speed: 9+6 is indeed 15. 75 divided by 15 is 5. Then 9 times 5 is 45. Yep. The math checks out. So the answer is A.\n",

I need to find out how far Ant A travels until they meet.\n\nHmm, right, when two objects move towards each other, their speeds add up. So maybe I should first figure out how long it takes for them to meet. Because once I know the time, I can multiply by Ant A's speed to get the distance.\n\nLet me think. The total distance between them is 75 cm. The combined speed is 9 + 6 = 15 cm per hour. So time until meeting would be the distance divided by the combined speed. That's 75 divided by 15. Oh, that's 5 hours. \n\nWait, so then Ant A is moving at 9 cm/h for 5 hours. So 9 times 5 is 45. That would be 45 cm. Let me check the options. Option A is 45. But wait, maybe I did something wrong here. Let me verify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up equations. Let\u2019s say the distance Ant A travels is d. Then Ant B would have traveled (75 - d) cm by the time they meet. The time taken for both should be the same, right?\n\nSo time for Ant A is d / 9, and time for Ant B is (75 - d)/6. Setting them equal: d/9 = (75 - d)/6. Cross-multiplying: 6d = 9*(75 - d). Let's compute that: 6d = 675 -9d. Adding 9d to both sides gives 15d = 675. Dividing both sides by 15: d= 675/15. Let's calculate that. 15*45 is 675, so d=45. Oh, same answer. So the first method was correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be 45 cm. Which is option A. Wait, but why do I feel like maybe there's a trick here? Like maybe the ants start at the same time? The problem says they're moving towards each other from their farms, so I think that's the case.
