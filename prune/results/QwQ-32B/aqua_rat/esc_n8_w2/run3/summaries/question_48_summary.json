      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the required sales for the servant to reach a certain income. Hmm. So the servant has a base salary of 1500 rupees per month. Plus, he gets a 15% commission on his monthly sales. His total desired income is 6000. I need to find out how much in sales he needs to make to get that total.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The total income is the sum of the base salary and the commission. The commission is 15% of his sales. Let me write that as an equation. Let S be the monthly sales. Then:\n\nTotal Income = Base Salary + (Commission Rate \u00d7 Sales)\nSo, 6000 = 1500 + 0.15 \u00d7 S\n\nI need to solve for S here. Subtract the base salary from both sides first. \n\n6000 - 1500 = 0.15 \u00d7 S\nThat gives 4500 = 0.15 \u00d7 S\n\nNow, to find S, divide both sides by 0.15. \n\nS = 4500 / 0.15 \n\nHmm, let me calculate that. 4500 divided by 0.15. Well, 0.15 is the same as 3/20, so dividing by 3/20 is the same as multiplying by 20/3. Let me see: 4500 multiplied by 20 is 90,000, then divided by 3 gives 30,000. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 4500 divided by 0.15. Let me do it another way. 0.15 times 30,000 would be 4500, yes. Because 10% of 30,000 is 3000, so 15% is 4500. So yes, that works. \n\nSo the required sales are 30,000. Let me check the options. Option A is 30,000. So that would be the answer. Wait, but let me double-check. \n\nWait the options are A)30000, C)31500. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait the problem says \"monthly income as 6000\". Let me recalculate. \n\nBase is 1500. Commission needed is 6000-1500 = 4500. So 15% of sales must be 4500. So 0.15 \u00d7 S =4500 \u2192 S=4500/0.15 = 30,000. That's correct. So A is the right option. \n\nLooking at the options again, option C is 31500. Maybe I miscalculated? Let me check division again. 4500 divided by 0.15. 0.15 \u00d7 30,000 is indeed 4500. So yes. So answer is A. But wait the options given include A as 30000. So the correct answer should be A. But why is option C there? Maybe a common mistake like adding instead of subtracting? Or maybe I misread the question?\n\nWait the question says \"how much sale... should the servant do if he wants his monthly income as 6000\". So yes, my calculation seems right. So the answer is A. But let me check again the options. The options given are A)30000, B)415000, C)31500, D)50000. So A is correct. So the answer must be A. But wait the options might have a typo or maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the commission is on the total sales over a certain amount? No, the problem states \"15% on the monthly sale\", so it's 15% of total sales. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is A. So the answer is option A. But wait the options given include option C as 31500. Wait, maybe the question had a different percentage? Let me check again the problem statement. \n\nThe problem says: \"commission of 15% on the monthly sale\". Yes, so 15% of the total sales. So yes, the calculation is right. So the answer is A. But the options have A as 30,000 which matches. Therefore the correct answer is A. So why is there an option C? Maybe a distractor. So the answer is A.\n",

His salary is 1500 plus a 15% commission on monthly sales. I need to find out how much sale he needs to make to reach that total income.\n\nHmm, so the total income is the fixed salary plus the commission. The fixed part is 1500. The commission is 15% of his sales. Let me write that down as an equation maybe. Let me think: Let S be the total sales. Then his commission would be 0.15 * S. So total income is 1500 + 0.15S = 6000. \n\nRight, so solving for S. Subtract 1500 from both sides first. That gives 0.15S = 6000 - 1500. 6000 minus 1500 is 4500. So 0.15S = 4500. Then to find S, divide both sides by 0.15. \n\nCalculating that: 4500 divided by 0.15. Let me do that math. 4500 divided by 0.15. Well, 0.15 is the same as 3/20, so dividing by 3/20 is the same as multiplying by 20/3. So 4500 * (20/3). Let me compute that. 4500 divided by 3 is 1500, then multiply by 20 gives 30,000. Wait, so S would be 30,000? \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 30,000. So that would be the answer? But let me double-check. Let me plug back in. 15% of 30,000 is 0.15 *30,000 = 4500. Then add the 1500 salary: 4500 +1500 = 6000. Yep, that works. \n\nWait, but the options also include option C as 31500. Did I make a mistake? Let me check the calculation again. 4500 divided by 0.15. Let's do it step by step. 0.15 times 30,000 is indeed 4500. So the calculation seems right. \n\nHmm, maybe I misread the options. Let me look again. Option C is 31500. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction. 6000 minus 1500 is 4500, that's correct. So the answer should be 30,000, which is option A. But why is there an option C? Maybe I need to check if there's a trick here. Like, perhaps the commission is on the profit instead of sales? But the question says \"monthly sale\", so it's on sales. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a different currency, but the problem states \"Rupees\" so that's okay. Hmm. The math checks out. So the correct answer is A. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)30000, B)415000, C)31500, D)50000, E) None. \n\nHmm, so 30k is an option. So the answer should be A. Unless there's a miscalculation. Let me recalculate once more. \n\nTotal desired income: 6000. Fixed is 1500. So commission needed is 6000-1500 = 4500. Commission is 15% of sales. So 15% of S =4500. \n\nSo S = 4500 / 0.15. 4500 divided by 0.15. Let me compute that again. 0.15 \u00d7 30,000 = 4500. So yes. So answer is A. Therefore, the correct answer should be A. But wait, the options list C as 31500. Maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I did a miscalculation when dividing. Let me try another way. 4500 divided by 0.15. Let me think of 0.15 as 15/100. So dividing by 15/100 is multiplying by 100/15. So 4500 \u00d7 (100/15) = (4500/15)*100. 4500 divided by 15 is 300. 300 \u00d7 100 is 30,000. Yep, that's correct. So A must be the answer. Therefore, the correct option is A. The options given include A, so the answer is A. So the answer is option A. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n",
