      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about a survey where students picked their two favorite songs from a list of 10. Each song was selected 5 times. We need to find out how many students were surveyed. Hmm.\n\nAlright, so each student chooses 2 songs. That means each student contributes 2 selections. The total number of selections across all students would be 2 times the number of students, right? Let me write that down. Let the number of students be N. Then total selections = 2*N.\n\nOn the other hand, each of the 10 songs was selected 5 times. So the total number of selections is also 10 songs multiplied by 5 selections each. That's 10*5 = 50. \n\nWait a second, so the total selections from both perspectives should be equal. So 2*N = 50. Then solving for N would be 50/2 = 25. Oh, so the answer would be D)25? Let me check again to be sure.\n\nEach song was selected 5 times. 10 songs, each with 5 picks: 10*5=50 total picks. Each student made 2 picks, so total picks are 2*N. Therefore 2N=50 \u2192 N=25. Yeah, that makes sense. The options given include D as 25, so that must be the right answer. The other options don't fit. Let me check if I misread the question. The problem says each student selected 2 songs that they liked best, so each student's choices are exactly two distinct songs? Or could they pick the same song twice? Hmm, the wording says \"the 2 songs that the student liked best\", implying two different songs. So each selection is two distinct songs, but the problem counts each song's total selections. So even if a student picked song A and B, each of those counts once. So the total counts per song are just additive. So the calculation holds. Therefore D is correct.\n",

Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe question says that each student picked 2 songs from a list of 10 that they liked best. Each song was selected 5 times. We have to find out the number of students. The options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. Since each student chooses 2 songs, each student contributes 2 selections. So the total number of selections made by all students should be equal to the number of students multiplied by 2. Let me note that as Total selections = 2 * number of students.\n\nOn the other hand, each of the 10 songs was selected 5 times. So the total number of selections can also be calculated by multiplying the number of songs by the number of times each was chosen. That would be 10 songs * 5 selections each = 50 total selections. \n\nSo putting those two together: 2 * number of students = 50. To find the number of students, divide 50 by 2. That gives 25. Wait, so the number of students would be 25? Let me check the options again. Option D is 25, so that must be the answer.\n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me rephrase the problem. Each song was selected 5 times. There are 10 songs, so total selections are indeed 10*5=50. Each student made 2 choices, so total selections are also 2*N, where N is the number of students. So 2N = 50 \u2192 N=25. That seems straightforward. I don't see any complications here. The key is that each selection is counted per song, so adding up all the song selections gives the total number of choices made by all students, and each student contributes exactly two. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D)25.\n",
