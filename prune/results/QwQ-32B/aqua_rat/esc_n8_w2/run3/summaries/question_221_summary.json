      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this ratio problem here. Let's see. The question says two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. Then, when 9 is subtracted from each, their new ratio becomes 12:23. I need to find the smaller number. The options are given, so maybe I can check them, but I should probably work it out step by step first.\n\nHmm, ratios. Let me think. When dealing with ratios, it's often helpful to introduce a variable that represents the common factor. Like, if the numbers are in the ratio 3:5, I can call them 3x and 5x. That way, their actual values are multiples of these ratios. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo let me set up the variables. Let the two numbers be 3x and 5x. The problem says when 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio is 12:23. So the new numbers would be (3x - 9) and (5x - 9), right? And the ratio of these two should be 12/23. \n\nSo I can set up the equation: (3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23. Then solve for x. Once I find x, I can find the original numbers and pick the smaller one.\n\nLet me do the algebra step by step. Cross-multiplying gives: 23*(3x - 9) = 12*(5x -9). Let me compute each side. \n\n23 times 3x is 69x, and 23 times -9 is -207. On the right side, 12*5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So the equation becomes:\n\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108\n\nNow subtract 60x from both sides: 9x -207 = -108. Then add 207 to both sides: 9x = 99. So x is 11. \n\nWait, so x is 11. Then the original numbers are 3x and 5x. Let's calculate them. \n\n3x = 3*11 = 33, and 5x = 55. Wait, but 33 and 55. The smaller number is 33? Hmm, but looking at the options, B is 33 and A is 21. Let me check again because maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculation again. Let's go through the steps once more to be sure.\n\nStarting with the equation after cross-multiplying:\n\n23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9)\n\nCalculating left side: 23*3x is indeed 69x, 23*9 is 207, so with the negative, it's -207. Right side: 12*5x is 60x, 12*9 is 108, so -108. So equation is 69x -207 = 60x -108.\n\nSubtract 60x from both sides: 9x -207 = -108. Adding 207 to both sides gives 9x = 99. Yes, so x=11. So the numbers are 33 and 55. The smaller is 33, which is option B. Hmm. But wait, let me check if substituting back into the problem works.\n\nOriginal ratio: 33:55. Dividing both by 11 gives 3:5. That's correct. Then subtract 9 from each: 33-9=24 and 55-9=46. The new ratio is 24:46. Let me simplify that. Dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 12:23. Exactly the ratio given in the problem. So that works. So the answer should be 33, option B. \n\nBut wait, the options given include A)21, B)33, etc. So B is an option. But let me check if maybe I made a mistake in the question. The problem asks for the smaller number. The original numbers are 33 and 55, so 33 is the smaller. So B is correct. Hmm. So why am I second-guessing? Maybe because sometimes there's a trick, but I think this is straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if another option could fit. Let me see. Let's try option A, 21. Suppose the smaller number is 21. Then the original ratio is 3:5, so the numbers would be 21 and 35 (since 21/35 is 3/5). Wait, 21 divided by 35 is 3/5, yes. Then subtract 9 from each: 12 and 26. The ratio 12:26 simplifies to 6:13, which is not 12:23. So that's not right. So A is out.\n\nOption C is 35. Wait, 35 is the larger number in the 21 case, but if the smaller number were 35, then the larger would be (35*(5/3))? Let's see, 35 would be the 3 part, so 5 parts would be (35 *5)/3 \u2248 58.33. Not an integer. Probably not. Hmm, maybe not. Let me see. If the numbers were 35 and (35*(5/3)), but that's fractional. So that might not be right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me think again. The problem says when 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio is 12:23. So (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Cross-multiplying gives 23*(3x-9) = 12*(5x-9). That's correct. \n\nHmm, so I think my solution is correct. So the answer is B)33. So the options given have B as 33. Therefore, the correct answer must be B. \n\nWait, but let me check another option just to be thorough. Let's check D)42. If the smaller number were 42, then the ratio 3:5 would mean the numbers are 42 and 70 (since 42/70 is 3/5). Subtract 9 from each: 33 and 61. The ratio 33:61. Let's see, 33 divided by 12 is 2.75, 61 divided by 23 is about 2.65. Not equal. So that's not 12:23. \n\nE)58. If the smaller number was 58, then the other would be (58*5)/3 \u2248 96.66, which isn't an integer. So that's not possible. \n\nSo the only one that works is B)33. Therefore, I think that's the correct answer.\n",

Wait, 35 is the larger number here, since the ratio is 3:5. Wait no, if the smaller number was 35, then the larger would be (35*5)/3, which is not an integer. 35 isn't a multiple of 3. So that can't be. So maybe C is not possible.\n\nD)42. That's a multiple of 3. The larger would be (42*(5/3))=70. Subtract 9: 33 and 61. 33/61 is not 12/23. 12/23 is about 0.5217, and 33/61 is ~0.5409. Not equal.\n\nE)58. That's even, but 58 divided by 3? Not sure. Wait, if the smaller was 58, then the larger would be (5/3)*58, which is not integer. So that's not possible. So the only possible one is B. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be B)33.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the two numbers be \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\) based on their ratio of 3:5. When 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23. Setting up the equation for the new ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 9}{5x - 9} = \\frac{12}{23}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n9x = 99 \\implies x = 11\n\\]\n\nThe original numbers are \\(3x = 33\\) and \\(5x = 55\\). The smaller number is \\(33\\). Verifying the new ratio after subtracting 9: \\((33-9)/(55-9) = 24/46 = 12/23\\), which matches the given condition. Checking other options confirms no discrepancies. \n\nAnswer: B)33.\n\nAnswer: B",
