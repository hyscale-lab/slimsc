      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so there's this problem about a ship and a plane. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm. The question says that a ship went on a voyage, and after it had traveled 180 miles, a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. We need to find the distance from the starting point when they meet.\n\nWait, right. Let me parse that again. The ship starts first, travels 180 miles, then the plane starts. The plane's speed is 10 times the ship's speed. We have to find the distance from the starting point when they meet.\n\nLet me think about the variables here. Let me denote the ship's speed as 'v' (maybe in miles per hour?), so the plane's speed would be 10v. \n\nNow, the ship had a head start. How much time did the ship take to go those 180 miles? Well, time is distance divided by speed. So the time the ship traveled before the plane started is 180 / v hours. \n\nThen, after that, the plane starts moving. From that point on, both the ship and the plane are moving, but the plane is going much faster. The question is, how long until they meet?\n\nLet me denote the time from when the plane starts until they meet as 't' hours. During that time, the ship will have traveled an additional distance of v * t miles. The plane, moving at 10v, will have traveled 10v * t miles in that same time.\n\nAt the meeting point, the total distance the ship has traveled is 180 + v*t. The plane's distance is 10v * t. Since they meet at the same point, those distances must be equal, right?\n\nWait, no. Wait a second. Wait, the plane is starting from the same starting point? Or does the plane start from the same point where the ship was after 180 miles? Wait, the problem says \"after it had traveled 180 miles a plane started\". So I think the plane starts from the original starting point, not from where the ship was. Because otherwise, if the plane started where the ship was after 180 miles, then the plane would just be catching up to the ship's position, but that might not make sense. Let me re-read the problem.\n\n\"A ship went on a voyage. After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship. Find the distance when they meet from starting point.\"\n\nSo the plane starts when the ship has already gone 180 miles. The plane's starting point is presumably the same as the ship's starting point, so the ship is now 180 miles ahead, and then the plane starts moving towards the same direction, but 10 times faster. Wait, but planes usually fly, so maybe the plane is going to fly towards the ship? Or is the ship moving along the same path as the plane? Hmm, the problem says \"distance when they meet from starting point\", so maybe they are moving in the same direction. So the plane is trying to catch up to the ship, which is moving away from the starting point.\n\nWait, that's the key. The ship is moving away, and the plane starts later but at a higher speed. So we have to calculate when the plane catches up to the ship. \n\nWait, but the distance from the starting point would be where they meet. Let me think of the equations again. \n\nLet me set up variables properly. Let me let the speed of the ship be v. So the plane's speed is 10v. \n\nThe ship has a head start of 180 miles. The time that the ship traveled before the plane started is (180)/v hours. But once the plane starts, let's let t be the time after the plane starts until they meet. \n\nIn that time t, the ship will have gone an additional distance of v*t. So the total distance from start for the ship is 180 + v*t. \n\nThe plane, in time t, travels 10v * t. \n\nSince they meet, their distances from the starting point must be equal. So:\n\n180 + v*t = 10v * t\n\nSolving for t:\n\n180 = 10v t - v t\n\n180 = 9v t\n\nSo t = 180/(9v) = 20/(v). Hmm, but that seems to have a v in the denominator. Wait, but maybe we can find the distance in terms of v and see if it cancels?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the equation is correct. So 180 + v t = 10v t. Subtract v t from both sides gives 180 = 9v t \u2192 t = 180/(9v) = 20 / v. \n\nHmm, but then the plane's distance is 10v * t = 10v*(20/v) = 200. So the distance from the starting point would be 200 miles. So the answer would be C)200?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because the ship's total distance would be 180 + v*(20/v) = 180 +20= 200. Yes, that's correct. So both distances are 200. So the answer is C.\n\nBut let me think again to make sure. Let me try with numbers. Suppose the ship's speed is 10 mph. Then the plane's speed is 100 mph. \n\nThe ship went 180 miles, which took 18 hours (since 180 /10 =18 hours). Then the plane starts. Let the time taken until meeting be t hours. \n\nIn that time, the ship goes 10*t miles, so total distance 180 +10t. The plane goes 100*t. \n\nSet equal: 180 +10t =100 t \u2192 180 =90 t \u2192 t=2. \n\nThen the plane's distance is 100 *2 = 200. The ship's distance is 180 +10*2=200. So that works. So the answer is C)200. That's one of the options, so I think that's right.\n",

The plane's speed is then \\( 10v \\). When the plane starts, the ship is already 180 miles from the starting point. Let \\( t \\) be the time in hours it takes for them to meet after the plane starts.\n\nDuring this time \\( t \\), the ship travels an additional \\( v \\cdot t \\) miles, so its total distance from the start is \\( 180 + v \\cdot t \\). The plane, moving at \\( 10v \\), travels \\( 10v \\cdot t \\) miles in the same time. Since they meet, their distances from the starting point must be equal:\n\n\\[\n180 + v \\cdot t = 10v \\cdot t\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( t \\):\n\n\\[\n180 = 10v \\cdot t - v \\cdot t \\implies 180 = 9v \\cdot t \\implies t = \\frac{180}{9v} = \\frac{20}{v}\n\\]\n\nThe distance traveled by the plane when they meet is:\n\n\\[\n10v \\cdot t = 10v \\cdot \\left( \\frac{20}{v} \\right) = 200 \\text{ miles}\n\\]\n\nThus, the distance from the starting point when they meet is **200 miles**, corresponding to option C.\n\nAnswer: C",
