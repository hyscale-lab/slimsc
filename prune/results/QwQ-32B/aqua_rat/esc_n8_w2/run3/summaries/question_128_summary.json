      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about figuring out how many senators Hoopsmot can claim as his own based on his contribution compared to Smolapon's. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the total amount they contributed together is Hoopsmot's $16,000 plus Smolapon's $4,000. Adding those together gives $20,000 total. The total number of senators they can influence is 30. The question is asking how many of those 30 are Hoopsmot's share.\n\nHmm, right, this sounds like a proportion problem. Since they're contributing different amounts, their share of the senators should be proportional to their contributions. So, Hoopsmot put in 16k out of the total 20k. To find his percentage, I can calculate 16,000 divided by 20,000. Let me do that division: 16/20 simplifies to 4/5, which is 0.8. Converting that to a percentage is 80%. \n\nSo if Hoopsmot contributed 80% of the total money, then he should get 80% of the 30 senators. Let me calculate 80% of 30. 0.8 times 30 equals... 24. Wait, 0.8 times 30 is 24. So that would be 24 senators. Let me check the options. Option D is 24. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. The total contributions are 16k +4k =20k. Hoopsmot's share is 16/20, which is 0.8. 0.8 *30 is indeed 24. The answer should be D)24. Let me see if any other options could be possible. Like, maybe someone might think to split it equally? But no, the problem states their contributions, so it's definitely based on the ratio. The options given include 24, so I think D is correct.\n",

They contributed money together, right? Hoopsmot put in $16,000 and Smolapon $4,000. Together that's a total of $20,000. The total senators influenced are 30. \n\nI think this is a proportion problem. Like, each partner's share of the senators should be proportional to how much they contributed. So first, let me find out the total contribution. 16k plus 4k is 20,000. So Hoopsmot contributed 16/20 of the total, and Smolapon 4/20. \n\nSo the number of senators Hoopsmot's responsible for would be (16/20) multiplied by 30. Let me calculate that. 16 divided by 20 is 0.8. 0.8 times 30 equals... 24? Wait, 0.8 * 30 is 24. Because 30 times 0.8 is 24. So that would be answer D)24. \n\nBut let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe it's a ratio problem. The ratio of their contributions is 16:4, which simplifies to 4:1. So for every 5 parts, Hoopsmot has 4 parts. The total parts are 5, so 30 divided by 5 is 6. So each part is 6. Then Hoopsmot's share is 4*6=24. Yeah, same answer. So the correct answer should be D.\n",
