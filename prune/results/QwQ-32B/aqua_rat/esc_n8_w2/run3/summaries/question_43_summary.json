      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is asking, if 120 is reduced to 96, what's the percentage reduction. Hmm, percentage decrease, right? Let me think how that's calculated.\n\nI remember the formula for percentage decrease is [(Original - New)/Original] multiplied by 100. Wait, yeah, because you take the difference, divide by the original amount, then times 100 to get the percentage. \n\nSo here the original number is 120, and the new number is 96. Let me subtract them first: 120 minus 96 equals 24. Oh right, that's the amount of decrease. Then I divide that by the original, which is 120. So 24 divided by 120. Let me calculate that. \n\n24 divided by 120... Hmm, 24 divided by 120. Well, 120 divided by 24 is 5, so 24 divided by 120 should be 0.2. Wait, because 24 is 1/5 of 120. Because 120 divided by 5 is 24. So 0.2 times 100 is 20%. So that's 20% decrease. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 20%. So the answer should be C. Let me double-check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I mixed up the formula? Like, sometimes people get confused between percentage decrease and increase. But no, percentage decrease is definitely (Original - New)/Original. So 24/120 is 0.2, which is 20%. Yeah, that makes sense. \n\nAnother way: If I think, 120 minus 20% of 120 is 24, so 120 -24 = 96. Exactly. So that checks out. So the reduction is 20%, so the correct answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out what the percentage reduction is when 120 is reduced to 96. Hmm, percentage decrease, right? Let me remember how that works. I think the formula is [(Original - New)/Original] times 100. Yeah, that sounds familiar. \n\nSo the original number here is 120, and the new number after reduction is 96. So subtract 96 from 120 first. Let me do that: 120 minus 96 equals... 24. Right, the difference is 24. \n\nThen I have to divide that by the original amount, which is 120. So 24 divided by 120. Let me compute that. 24 divided by 120... Well, 24 divided by 120 is the same as 24/120. Simplifying that fraction, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 24? Wait, 24 and 120. Let's see, 24 divides into 120 five times because 24*5 is 120. So 24/120 is 1/5. Oh right, so 1/5 is 0.2. \n\nThen multiplying by 100 gives the percentage. 0.2 times 100 is 20%. Wait, but hold on. Let me check the options again. The options are A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%. So that would be option C. But wait, maybe I did something wrong here? Let me think again. \n\nWait a second, maybe I mixed up the formula. Percentage decrease is (Original - New)/Original *100. So yes, that's exactly what I did. 24 divided by 120 is 0.2, so 20% decrease. So the answer should be C. But let me check the options again. The options include 20% as option C, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think of it as a proportion. Like, 96 is what percentage of 120? Then 96/120 = 0.8, which is 80%. So the reduction is 100% - 80% = 20%. Yep, same answer. So I think that's right. So the correct option is C.\n",
