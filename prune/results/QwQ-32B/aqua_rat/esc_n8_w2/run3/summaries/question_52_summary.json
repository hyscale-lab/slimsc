      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. The problem says that a man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. We need to find his monthly income. Hmm, right. So, first, I should figure out what percentage of his income he's spending, then use that to calculate the total income.\n\nWait, saving is 12.5%, so the rest must be what he spends. Let me think. If he saves 12.5%, then the amount he spends is 100% minus 12.5%, which is 87.5% of his income. Oh right, because 100% is the total income. So the spending is 87.5% of his income, and that's equal to Rs. 3500. \n\nSo, to find the total income, let me denote his income as 'x'. Then 87.5% of x equals 3500. So, 0.875 * x = 3500. To find x, I need to divide 3500 by 0.875. Let me calculate that.\n\nWait, 0.875 is the same as 7/8, right? Because 1/8 is 0.125, so 7/8 is 0.875. Oh, that might make the calculation easier. So if 7/8 of x is 3500, then x is 3500 multiplied by 8/7. Let me do that. 3500 divided by 7 is 500, so 500 times 8 is 4000. Oh, so x would be 4000. \n\nWait, so his monthly income is Rs. 4000? Let me check the options. Option C is 4000. But wait, let me confirm again. Let me do the division the other way. 3500 divided by 0.875. Let me compute 3500 divided by 0.875. \n\nAlternatively, 0.875 is 7/8, so dividing by 7/8 is multiplying by 8/7. 3500 *8 = 28000. Then divide by 7: 28000/7 is 4000. Yeah, that's correct. \n\nSo the answer should be C) Rs.4000. Let me check the options again. The options given are A)4400, B)4270, C)4000, D)3937.50, E) None. So C is there, so the answer is C. Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the percentage part. \n\nThe problem states he saves 12 1/2%, which is 12.5%, so the remaining 87.5% is spent. Since he's spending 3500, that's 87.5% of income. So yes, the calculation is correct. So the answer is C. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me check another way. Suppose his income is 4000. 12.5% of 4000 is 500. So he saves 500, and spends 3500. That adds up. 4000 -500 is 3500. So yes, that's exactly matching the problem. So definitely option C is correct. So the answer is C.\n",

Hmm, right. \n\nFirst, I remember that the total income is the sum of his expenditure and savings. So if he saves a certain percentage of his income, then the rest he spends. Wait, the problem says he saves 12.5%, which is the same as 12 1/2%. So maybe I can set up an equation here.\n\nLet me denote his monthly income as 'I'. If he saves 12.5% of I, then his savings would be 0.125 * I. The amount he spends is the rest, which would be his income minus savings. So expenditure = I - (0.125 * I) = I*(1 - 0.125) = I * 0.875. \n\nBut according to the problem, he spends Rs. 3500. So that means 0.875 * I = 3500. To find I, I need to divide 3500 by 0.875. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 3500 divided by 0.875. Let's see. Maybe converting 0.875 to a fraction would make it easier. 0.875 is 7/8. Because 1/8 is 0.125, so 7/8 is 0.875. So dividing by 7/8 is the same as multiplying by 8/7. So 3500 * (8/7). Let's compute that.\n\n3500 divided by 7 is 500. Then 500 multiplied by 8 gives 4000. Oh, so that would make his income Rs. 4000. Wait, but let me check the options. Option C is 4000. But wait, let me confirm again to make sure I didn't mix up anything. \n\nWait, the saving percentage is 12.5%, so the expenditure is 87.5%, which is correct. So 87.5% of income equals 3500. So 0.875I = 3500 \u2192 I = 3500 / 0.875. Let me do the division again numerically. \n\n3500 divided by 0.875. Let's see: 0.875 \u00d7 4000 is 3500? Let's check: 0.875 \u00d7 4000. 4000 \u00d7 0.8 is 3200, 4000 \u00d7 0.075 is 300. So total 3200 + 300 = 3500. Yes, that works. So the income is indeed 4000. \n\nLooking at the options: C is 4000. So the answer should be C. But wait, let me check the options again to make sure I didn't misread. The options are A)4400, B)4270, C)4000, D)3937.50, and E) None. So yes, C is there. So the correct answer must be C. \n\nWait a second, but maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the expenditure is 87.5%? Let me read the problem again. The man spends 3500 and saves 12.5% of his income. So yes, the saving is 12.5% of total income, so expenditure is 100% -12.5% = 87.5% of income, which equals 3500. So calculations are correct.
