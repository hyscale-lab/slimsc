      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The question is about a cereal mixture with rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio 2:3:5. The problem states that a bag has 3 pounds of rice, and we need to find out how much corn it contains. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this.\n\nFirst, ratios are about parts. The ratio given is 2:3:5 for rice, wheat, corn. So for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts wheat and 5 parts corn. The total parts would be 2+3+5=10 parts, but maybe I don't need the total. \n\nThe key here is that the amount of rice corresponds to 2 parts. Since they tell us there are 3 pounds of rice, each part must be 3 divided by 2. Let me write that down. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the parts as x. So rice is 2x, wheat 3x, corn 5x. Wait, actually, maybe I should think of the ratio as parts. So if the ratio is 2:3:5, then rice is 2 parts, so each part is (rice amount)/2. Since the rice is 3 pounds, each part is 3/2 = 1.5 pounds. \n\nThen corn is 5 parts, so 5 * 1.5 = 7.5 pounds. That would be option B. But let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe setting up a proportion. The ratio of rice to corn is 2:5. So rice/corn = 2/5. Therefore, if rice is 3 pounds, then 3/corn = 2/5. Solving for corn: corn = (3 *5)/2 = 15/2 =7.5. Yeah, same answer. So B)7.5. \n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no trick here. The problem says the mixture is in the ratio 2:3:5. So the parts are in that exact order? The question lists rice, wheat, corn. So yes, the first number is rice (2), then wheat (3), then corn (5). So the ratio of rice to corn is indeed 2:5. \n\nTherefore the calculation is correct. So the answer should be B. Let me check the options again. Option B is 7.5. So that's the right choice. I don't see any issues here. The answer must be B.\n",

Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, ratios compare the quantities.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of scaling the ratio. The original ratio is 2:3:5. The actual rice is 3 pounds. The ratio's rice part is 2. So the scaling factor is 3 divided by 2, which is 1.5. So each unit in the ratio is multiplied by 1.5. So corn is 5 parts, so 5 * 1.5 is indeed 7.5. That seems right. So the answer should be B)7.5. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)6.5, B)7.5, C)7, D)6, E) None. Since B is there, the answer must be B. I don't see any mistake here.
