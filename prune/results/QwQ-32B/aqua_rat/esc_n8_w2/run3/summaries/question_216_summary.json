      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the units digit of 9 cubed minus 7. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the units digit, which is the last digit of the number when written out. I don't need to calculate the entire number, just focus on the last digit. \n\nFirst, let's figure out what 9^3 is. Well, 9 multiplied by itself a few times. Let me break it down step by step. \n\n9^1 is 9, so units digit is 9. \n9^2 is 9*9 = 81. The units digit here is 1. \nThen 9^3 would be 9^2 * 9, which is 81 *9. Let me calculate that. 81 times 9... 80*9 is 720, plus 1*9 is 9, so total 729. So the units digit of 9^3 is 9. Wait, but 81 times 9 ends with 29? Wait, 81*9: 80*9 is 720, plus 9 is 729. Yeah, so units digit is 9. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern with the powers of 9's units digits. Let me think. Like, 9^1 is 9, 9^2 ends with 1, 9^3 ends with 9 again, then 9^4 would end with 1, and so on. So the pattern cycles every 2 exponents: 9, 1, 9, 1... So since 3 is odd, the exponent 3 would give a units digit of 9. Yeah that matches the earlier calculation. \n\nSo 9^3's units digit is 9. Now subtract 7. Wait, so the problem is 9^3 minus 7. The units digit after the subtraction? \n\nWait, but how do you subtract 7 from a number ending with 9? Let me think. If the number is ...9 (like 729), then subtract 7 gives ...2. Because 9 minus 7 is 2. Wait, that's straightforward. So 729 minus 7 is 722, which ends with 2. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should check with another example. Let's see, suppose the units digit was 9, subtract 7: 9-7=2. So the units digit of the result would be 2. So the answer would be D)2?\n\nWait but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. Let me recalculate 9^3 again. 9*9 is 81, then 81*9: 80*9=720, 1*9=9, so total 729. Correct. So 729 minus 7 is 722. So the units digit is 2, which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach it. Suppose I didn't calculate 9^3. Let's see: since the units digit of 9^3 is 9 (as per the pattern), subtract 7. So 9 minus 7 is 2. So the units digit is 2. That's the same result. \n\nHmm, so the options are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)2, E)4. So D is the correct answer here. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, what if there was a borrow involved? Like, suppose if the number was smaller. Like, if the units digit was less than 7? For example, if the number was 12, and we subtract 7, then 2-7 can't do, so borrow. But in this case, since the units digit is 9, which is higher than 7, so no borrowing needed. So 9-7=2. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore the answer should be D)2.\n",
