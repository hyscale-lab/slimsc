      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: The population of a city increases by 5% annually. The current population is 78,000, and I need to find out what it will be in two years. The options are given, but I should work it out step by step.\n\nHmm, right, population growth with a percentage increase each year. I remember that when something grows by a percentage each year, it's a case of compound interest formula, right? Like the formula A = P(1 + r)^t. Wait, yeah, because each year's increase is based on the current population. So here, P is the principal amount, which is the starting population. The rate r is 5%, so that's 0.05 as a decimal. Time t is 2 years.\n\nLet me plug the numbers in. So P is 78,000. The rate is 5%, so 0.05. So first, after one year, the population would be 78,000 multiplied by 1.05. Then, the second year, that result would again be multiplied by 1.05. So altogether, it's 78,000 * (1.05)^2.\n\nLet me compute that. Let me see, first, 1.05 squared. 1.05 times 1.05. Let's calculate that. 1.05 * 1.05: 1*1 is 1, 1*0.05 is 0.05, 0.05*1 is 0.05, and 0.05*0.05 is 0.0025. Adding all those together: 1 + 0.05 + 0.05 + 0.0025 = 1.1025. Wait, that can't be right. Wait no, actually, the correct way is (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Here a is 1, b is 0.05. So (1+0.05)^2 =1 + 0.10 + 0.0025 =1.1025. So yes, 1.05 squared is 1.1025.\n\nSo the total multiplier over two years is 1.1025. Now multiply that by the original population of 78,000.\n\nCalculating 78,000 * 1.1025. Let me break that down. Let's see, 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. Then 78,000 * 0.10 is 7,800. Then 78,000 * 0.0025 is... let me compute each part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 78,000 * 1.1025 directly. Let's try:\n\nFirst, 78,000 * 1.1 is 78,000 + 7,800 (since 10% of 78,000 is 7,800). So that would be 85,800. But then there's an extra 0.0025. So the total is 1.1 + 0.0025 = 1.1025. So the 0.0025 part is an additional 0.25% of the original?\n\nWait, maybe better to compute 78,000 * 1.1025.\n\nAlternatively, 1.1025 is equal to (1 + 0.1 + 0.0025) but maybe breaking down as fractions. Alternatively, 1.1025 is 441/400? Wait, 1.1025 multiplied by 400 is 441, right? Because 1.1 *400 =440, plus 0.0025*400=1, so total 441. So 441/400. So 78,000 * 441/400. Let me compute that.\n\nHmm, 78,000 divided by 400 first. 78,000 divided by 400. Well, 78,000 divided by 4 is 19,500. Then divided by 100, that's 195? Wait, no. Wait, 400 is 4*100. So 78,000 divided by 400 is (78,000 / 100) /4 = 780 /4 = 195. So that's 195. Then multiply by 441. 195 *441. Hmm, that might be a bit tedious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 195 * 400 is 78,000, but we have 441. Let's see, 195*(400 +41) = 195*400 +195*41. 195*400 is 78,000. 195*40 is 7,800, and 195*1 is 195. So 7,800 +195=7,995. So total is 78,000 +7,995 = 85,995. Wait, so that gives 85,995?\n\nWait, so according to this method, 78,000 * (441/400) equals 85,995. Which would be option B. But let me check another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, compute 78,000 *1.05 each year.\n\nFirst year: 78,000 *1.05. Let's calculate that. 78,000 *1.05 is 78,000 + 5% of 78,000. 5% of 78,000 is 3,900. So 78,000 +3,900 = 81,900 after first year.\n\nSecond year: 81,900 *1.05. Let's calculate that. 5% of 81,900 is 4,095. So adding that gives 81,900 +4,095 = 85,995. So that matches the previous result. So the answer is 85,995, which is option B. But let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)81900, B)85995, C)85800, D)90000, E)None. So B is one of the options. Wait, but let me check if I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, in the first year, 78,000 plus 5% is indeed 81,900. Then in the second year, 81,900 *1.05: Let me recalculate that. 81,900 * 0.05: 81,900 divided by 20 is 4,095. So adding that gives 81,900 +4,095 = 85,995. That's correct. So the answer is B.\n\nBut wait, option C is 85,800. Why is that an option? Maybe someone might miscalculate? Let me see, perhaps someone might do 78,000 * 1.10 (10% over two years) which would be 85,800. But that's simple interest. Because 5% per year simple would be 10% total. But the question says annual increase, so it's compound, so the correct is B.\n\nSo the answer should be B)85995. Therefore, the correct option is B.\n",

Wait no, actually, the correct way is (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Here a is 1, b is 0.05. So (1+0.05)^2 =1 + 0.10 + 0.0025 =1.1025. So yes, 1.05 squared is 1.1025.\n\nSo the total multiplier over two years is 1.1025. Now multiply that by the original population of 78,000.\n\nCalculating 78,000 * 1.1025. Let me break that down. Let's see, 78,000 * 1 is 78,000. Then 78,000 * 0.10 is 7,800. Then 78,000 * 0.0025 is... let me compute each part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 78,000 * 1.1025 directly.

So the 0.0025 part is an additional 0.25% of the original?\n\nWait, maybe better to compute 78,000 * 1.1025.\n\nAlternatively, 1.1025 is equal to (1 + 0.1 + 0.0025) but maybe breaking down as fractions. Alternatively, 1.1025 is 441/400? Wait, 1.1025 multiplied by 400 is 441, right? Because 1.1 *400 =440, plus 0.0025*400=1, so total 441. So 441/400. So 78,000 * 441/400. Let me compute that.\n\nHmm, 78,000 divided by 400 first. 78,000 divided by 400. Well, 78,000 divided by 4 is 19,500. Then divided by 100, that's 195? Wait, no. Wait, 400 is 4*100. So 78,000 divided by 400 is (78,000 / 100) /4 = 780 /4 = 195. So that's 195. Then multiply by 441. 195 *441. Hmm, that might be a bit tedious.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 195 * 400 is 78,000, but we have 441. Let's see, 195*(400 +41) = 195*400 +195*41. 195*400 is 78,000. 195*40 is 7,800, and 195*1 is 195. So 7,800 +195=7,995. So total is 78,000 +7,995 = 85,995. Wait, so that gives 85,995?\n\nWait, so according to this method, 78,000 * (441/400) equals 85,995. Which would be option B. But let me check another way to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, compute 78,000 *1.05 each year.\n\nFirst year: 78,000 *1.05. Let's calculate that. 78,000 *1.05 is 78,000 + 5% of 78,000. 5% of 78,000 is 3,900. So 78,000 +3,900 = 81,900 after first year.\n\nSecond year: 81,900 *1.05. Let's calculate that. 5% of 81,900 is 4,095. So adding that gives 81,900 +4,095 = 85,995. So that matches the previous result. So the answer is 85,995, which is option B. But let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)81900, B)85995, C)85800, D)90000, E)None. So B is one of the options. Wait, but let me check if I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, in the first year, 78,000 plus 5% is indeed 81,900. Then in the second year, 81,900 *1.05: Let me recalculate that. 81,900 * 0.05: 81,900 divided by 20 is 4,095. So adding that gives 81,900 +4,095 = 85,995. That's correct. So the answer is B.\n\nBut wait, option C is 85,800. Why is that an option? Maybe someone might miscalculate? Let me see, perhaps someone might do 78,000 * 1.10 (10% over two years) which would be 85,800. But that's simple interest. Because 5% per year simple would be 10% total. But the question says annual increase, so it's compound, so the correct is B.\n\nSo the answer should be B)85995. Therefore, the correct option is B.\n\n\nTo determine the population of the city in two years with an annual increase of 5%, we use the compound growth formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Future Population} = \\text{Current Population} \\times (1 + \\text{rate})^{\\text{time}}\n\\]  \nPlugging in the values:  \n\\[\n\\text{Future Population} = 78,\\!000 \\times (1 + 0.05)^2\n\\]  \nFirst, compute \\( (1.05)^2 = 1.1025 \\).

Option C (85,800) would result from incorrectly using simple interest (10% total increase), but the problem specifies annual compounding.  \n\nAnswer: B",

The city's population is increasing by 5% each year, and we need to find out what it will be in two years if it's currently 78,000. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that percentage increase over multiple years can be calculated using the formula for compound interest, since each year's increase is based on the previous year's population. The formula is:\n\nFuture Population = Present Population \u00d7 (1 + rate)^time\n\nThe rate here is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. The time is 2 years. So plugging in the numbers:\n\n78,000 multiplied by (1 + 0.05) squared. Let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, 1 + 0.05 is 1.05. Then, 1.05 squared. What's 1.05 squared? Let me calculate that. 1.05 times 1.05. 1 times 1 is 1, 1 times 0.05 is 0.05, 0.05 times 1 is another 0.05, and 0.05 times 0.05 is 0.0025. Adding those up: 1 + 0.05 +0.05 +0.0025. That totals 1.1025. So the multiplier after two years is 1.1025.\n\nNow, multiply 78,000 by 1.1025. Let me do that. Hmm, maybe break it down. 78,000 times 1 is 78,000. 78,000 times 0.10 is 7,800. Then 0.0025 times 78,000. Wait, maybe another way. Alternatively, 1.1025 can be considered as 1 + 0.10 + 0.0025? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps 78,000 * 1.1025.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute 78,000 * 1.10 first, then add the remaining 0.0025 part. Wait, maybe better to just do 78000 * 1.1025 directly.\n\nLet me compute 78000 * 1.1025:\n\nFirst, 78,000 * 1 = 78,000.\n\n78,000 * 0.1 = 7,800.0\n\n78,000 * 0.0025 = let's see, 0.0025 is a quarter of a percent. 1% of 78,000 is 780, so 0.25% is 195. So that's 195.\n\nAdding those up: 78,000 (from the 1) plus 7,800 (from 0.1) plus 195 (from 0.0025) equals 78,000 + 7,800 is 85,800. Then adding 195 gives 85,995. Wait, that's 85,800 + 195 = 85,995. Hmm, so the total would be 85,995?\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in breaking it down. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate 1.05 squared first, which is indeed 1.1025.

So after one year, population is 78,000 +3,900 = 81,900.\n\nSecond year, 5% of 81,900. Let's calculate that: 5% of 81,900 is 4,095. Adding that to 81,900 gives 81,900 +4,095 = 85,995. So that's the same result. So that's B.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)81900, B)85995, C)85800, D)90000, E) None.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

So yes, B is the correct answer.\n\nLooking at the options, B is present. So the answer is B. But wait, the options include C as 85800. Maybe someone might think to compute simple interest instead of compound? Let's see. If someone does simple interest, 5% per year for two years would be 10% total. 78,000 *1.10 is 85,800. Which is option C. But the question says \"increases by 5% annually\", which implies each year's increase is based on the current population, so compound growth.

So adding those together, 85,800 + 195 = 85,995. So that's correct.\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 85,995 and option C is 85,800. So the answer should be B? Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate each year's population step by step.\n\nFirst year: 78,000 increased by 5%.\n\n5% of 78,000 is 0.05 *78000 = 3,900. So after one year, population is 78,000 +3,900 = 81,900.\n\nSecond year, 5% of 81,900. Let's calculate that: 5% of 81,900 is 4,095. Adding that to 81,900 gives 81,900 +4,095 = 85,995. So that's the same result. So that's B.\n\nBut wait, the options are A)81900, B)85995, C)85800, D)90000, E) None.\n\nSo the correct answer is B. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nFirst year: 78,000 *1.05 is 78000 + 3900 = 81900. Second year: 81900 *1.05. Let's calculate 81900 *1.05. 81900 *1 is 81900. 81900 *0.05 is 4095. So total is 85,995. So yes, B is the correct answer.\n\nLooking at the options, B is present. So the answer is B. But wait, the options include C as 85800. Maybe someone might think to compute simple interest instead of compound? Let's see. If someone does simple interest, 5% per year for two years would be 10% total. 78,000 *1.10 is 85,800. Which is option C. But the question says \"increases by 5% annually\", which implies each year's increase is based on the current population, so compound growth. Therefore the correct answer should be B. So the answer is B. So the correct option is B. Therefore the answer is B.\n\n\nTo determine the population of the city in 2 years with an annual growth rate of 5%, we use the compound growth formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Future Population} = \\text{Present Population} \\times (1 + \\text{rate})^{\\text{time}}\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n- Present Population = 78,000\n- Rate = 5% = 0.05\n- Time = 2 years\n\nFirst, compute the growth factor:\n\\[\n(1 + 0.05)^2 = 1.05^2 = 1.1025\n\\]\n\nNext, multiply by the initial population:\n\\[\n78,000 \\times 1.1025 = 78,000 + (78,000 \\times 0.1025) = 78,000 + 8,000 + 195 = 85,995\n\\]\n\nVerifying step-by-step:\n- **Year 1**: \\(78,000 \\times 1.05 = 81,900\\)\n- **Year 2**: \\(81,900 \\times 1.05 = 85,995\\)\n\nThe correct answer is **B)85995**, as simple interest (which would give 85,800) is not applicable here. The problem specifies annual compounding.\n\nAnswer: B",
