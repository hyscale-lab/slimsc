      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find three consecutive integers whose product is equal to the sum of 727, 728, and 729. Then, I have to find the sum of those three integers. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's figure out what the sum of those three numbers is. The problem says the product of the three integers is 727 + 728 + 729. Let me add those numbers first. \n\n727 plus 728 is... let's see, 727 + 728. Well, 700+700 is 1400, and 27+28 is 55, so that's 1455. Then add 729 to that. Adding 729 to 1455. Let's see, 1455 + 700 is 2155, then plus 29 more makes 2184. Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I did that wrong. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the three numbers are 727, 728, and 729. Adding them all together. Let's add them one by one.\n\n727 + 728 = 727 + 728. 700+700 is 1400, 27+28 is 55. So total is 1455. Then adding the third number, 729 to that. 1455 + 729. Let me break that down again. 1400 + 700 = 2100, 55 +29 = 84. So total is 2184. Yeah, that's correct. So the product of the three consecutive integers must be 2184.\n\nNow I need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. Let's denote the three integers as n, n+1, and n+2. So their product is n*(n+1)*(n+2) = 2184. I need to find n here.\n\nHmm, maybe I can estimate the cube root of 2184 to approximate n. The cube root of 2000 is about 12.6, since 12^3 is 1728 and 13^3 is 2197. Wait, 13 cubed is 2197 which is very close to 2184. Oh! Wait, that's interesting. Because 13*13*13 is 2197. But the product we need is 2184, which is 13 less. Hmm, maybe the numbers are around there.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are 12, 13, 14. Let me check their product. Let's see, 12*13 is 156. Then 156 *14. Let me compute that: 156*10 is 1560, plus 156*4 is 624, so total 1560+624=2184. Oh! Exactly the number we have. So the three numbers are 12,13,14. \n\nTherefore, their sum is 12+13+14. Let's add those: 12+13 is 25, plus 14 is 39. Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 39. But hold on, let me check again. The options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39. So 39 is an option (E). \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me confirm the product again. 12 *13=156. 156 *14: 156 times 10 is 1560, 156 times4 is 624, so total 2184. Yes, that's correct. The sum of those three numbers is indeed 39. So the answer should be E. \n\nBut wait, let me check the problem again. The question says \"three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729\". Wait, the product is equal to the sum of those three numbers? Wait, the problem says \"can be expressed as 727+728+729\", which is the sum. So the product equals the sum. Wait no, no, the problem says the product is the sum. Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\"\n\nAh, okay. The product of the three integers equals the sum of those three numbers (727+728+729). Which is exactly what I did. So the product is 2184, which equals 727+728+729. Then the three integers are 12,13,14, sum is 39. So the correct answer is E. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options include 39 as E, so that's correct. But hold on, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Let me see if there are other possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three numbers are negative? Let me think. If the product is 2184 which is positive. So three consecutive integers with a positive product. That could be all positive, or two negative and one positive. But 2184 is a large positive number, so likely they are all positive. Because two negatives would make the product negative? Wait, no. Two negatives and one positive would multiply to a negative? Wait, no: (-a)*(-b)*(c) = a*b*c, which is positive. Hmm, but the numbers could be like -14, -13, -12. Their product would be (-14)*(-13)*(-12) = - (14*13*12) = -2184. Which is not equal to 2184, so that's not the case. So the three numbers must be positive. So 12,13,14 is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E)39. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let me see if there's another triplet. Let me try 13,14,15. Their product is 13*14*15. 13*14 is 182, then 182*15=2730 which is way too big. \n\nWhat about 11,12,13? 11*12 is 132, times 13 is 1716. That's less than 2184. So the correct triplet is between 11-13 and 12-14. So yes, 12,13,14 is correct. So the sum is 39. \n\nHmm, so the correct answer is E. But let me check the options again. The options given are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39. So E is the correct choice. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be E.\n",
