      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: add +45 and -30. Hmm, let me think. Alright, adding a positive and a negative number. I remember that when you add a positive and a negative number, you subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger one and take the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. \n\nWait, let me make sure. So the numbers are +45 and -30. The absolute values here are 45 and 30. Since 45 is bigger than 30, I subtract 30 from 45, which gives 15. Then, since the larger absolute value was from the positive number (+45), the result should be positive. So the answer would be +15? But looking at the options, D is 15 and B is +30. Wait, the options are A)-30, B)+30, C)0, D)15, E)-15. So D is 15, which is positive, right? The options might just write it as 15 instead of +15. So the correct answer should be D)15. Let me check again. 45 plus (-30) is the same as 45 minus 30. 45 minus 30 is indeed 15. Yeah, that's right. So the answer is D.\n",
