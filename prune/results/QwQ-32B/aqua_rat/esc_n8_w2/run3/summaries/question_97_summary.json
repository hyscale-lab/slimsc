      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a wire that's originally shaped like a rectangle and then bent into a square. The question is asking for the length of each side of the square. Let me think through how to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you bend a wire into different shapes, the total length of the wire remains the same. That means the perimeter of the original rectangle should be equal to the perimeter of the new square. Right? Because the wire is just being reshaped, not cut or extended.\n\nAlright, so the rectangle has a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times (length plus breadth). Let me calculate that. \n\nSo plugging in the numbers: 2*(27 + 17). Let's do the addition inside the parentheses first. 27 plus 17 is 44. Then multiply by 2, which gives 88 cm. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 27 plus 17 is 44? Let me check again. 20 + 10 is 30, 7+7 is 14. 30+14 is 44. Yeah, that's right. So 2*44 is 88. So the perimeter of the rectangle is 88 cm.\n\nNow, when this wire is bent into a square, the perimeter of the square will also be 88 cm. Since a square has four sides of equal length, each side should be the perimeter divided by 4. Let me write that down: side length of square = perimeter / 4. \n\nCalculating that: 88 divided by 4. Let me do that division. 4 times 22 is 88, so 88 divided by 4 is 22. Wait, but hold on, that would make each side 22 cm? Let me check again. 4 times 22 is indeed 88. So that seems right.\n\nLooking at the options given: the choices are A)9, B)11, C)22, D)25, E)31. So 22 is option C. Hmm. But wait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check my steps. \n\nFirst, the perimeter of the rectangle: 2*(length + breadth). The length was 27, breadth 17. So 27+17 is 44, multiplied by 2 gives 88. That's correct. Then the square's perimeter is the same, so each side is 88/4 = 22. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nHmm, but why is option B 11? Maybe I miscalculated. Wait, perhaps I added wrong? Let me re-add 27 and 17. 20+10 is 30, 7+7 is 14. 30+14 is 44. No, that's correct. So 2*44 is 88. Divided by 4 is 22. So the answer must be C)22. \n\nWait, but maybe I confused length and perimeter? Like, perhaps the question says the length is 27 cm, but maybe that's the total length? No, no, the question says a rectangle of length 27 and breadth 17. So the sides are 27 and 17. So the perimeter calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a different unit? No, the problem states centimeters. Hmm. The options include 22, which is C, so that's the answer. I think I didn't make a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me read again. \"A wire in the shape of a rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?\" Yep, that's exactly what I did. So the answer should be C)22. So the correct option is C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the side length of the square formed from the wire originally shaped as a rectangle, we first calculate the perimeter of the rectangle.
