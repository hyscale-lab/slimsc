      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about the difference between simple interest and compound interest for two years. The principal is Rs. 5000, and the difference is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest. Hmm, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI) formulas for two years might have a specific relationship. Let me recall the formulas. \n\nSimple Interest for two years is calculated as SI = P * R * T / 100. Here, T is 2 years, so that would be P*R*2/100. \n\nCompound Interest for two years is calculated on the principal for the first year, and then on the amount for the second year. So the formula for CI after two years would be P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. Alternatively, expanding that, it's P[(1 + R/100)^2 -1]. \n\nThe difference between CI and SI for two years is given as Rs.72. So, CI - SI = 72. \n\nWait, maybe there's a simpler formula for the difference between CI and SI for two years? Let me think. \n\nYes! The difference between CI and SI for two years is given by (P*(R/100)^2). Because:\n\nLet me verify that. Let's compute CI - SI.\n\nFirst, CI is P*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ). Let's expand that:\n\n(1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. Subtract 1, so CI becomes P*(2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 )\n\nSI is P*(2*R/100). \n\nSubtracting SI from CI: \n\nCI - SI = P*( (2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ) - 2*(R/100) ) \n\nThe 2*(R/100) terms cancel, leaving P*( (R/100)^2 )\n\nSo yes, the difference is P*(R^2)/(100^2). \n\nTherefore, the formula for the difference is (P * R^2) / (100)^2 = 72. \n\nGiven that P is 5000, plug that in: \n\n5000*(R^2)/(100*100) =72 \n\nLet me compute that equation. \n\nSo, 5000 * R\u00b2 / 10000 = 72 \n\nSimplify 5000/10000 is 0.5. So 0.5 * R\u00b2 =72. \n\nThen R\u00b2 = 72 / 0.5 = 144. \n\nTherefore, R = sqrt(144) =12. \n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B. \n\nWait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nThe difference formula is indeed (P*R\u00b2)/100\u00b2, right? Let me re-derive quickly. \n\nAlternatively, CI for two years is P(1 + r)^2 - P = P[(1+ r)^2 -1] where r is rate in decimal. \n\nExpanding (1 + r)^2 -1 = 1 + 2r + r\u00b2 -1 = 2r + r\u00b2. \n\nSo CI is P*(2r + r\u00b2). \n\nSI is P*2r. \n\nDifference is P*r\u00b2. \n\nWait, but here r is in decimal. Wait, the formula in terms of percentage: \n\nLet me use R as the rate in percentage. Then the rate in decimal is R/100. \n\nSo substituting back, the difference is P*( (R/100)^2 ) * P? Wait no, let's do it again:\n\nWait, CI - SI = P*( ( (R/100)^2 + 2*(R/100) ) - 2*(R/100) ) \n\nWait, the CI is P*(2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ), and SI is 2*(P*(R/100)). \n\nSo the difference is P*( (R/100)^2 ). \n\nYes, exactly. So the difference is P*(R^2)/(100)^2. \n\nSo plugging in P=5000, so 5000*(R^2)/(10000) = 72 \u2192 (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = 72 \u2192 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2 = 144 \u2192 R=12. \n\nSo the answer should be 12%, which is option B. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 12%, so that's the correct choice. \n\nHmm, the options given are A)10%, B)12%, C)6%, D)8%, E)4%. \n\nYes, so the correct answer is B. I think that's solid. Let me just check with another method to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, let's compute SI and CI for 12% and see if the difference is indeed 72. \n\nPrincipal = 5000, rate 12% for two years. \n\nSimple Interest: (5000 *12 *2)/100 = (5000*24)/100 = 1200. \n\nCompound Interest: \n\nFirst year interest: 5000 *12/100 = 600. Amount after first year: 5600. \n\nSecond year interest: 5600 *12/100 = 672. Total CI is 600 +672= 1272. \n\nDifference between CI and SI: 1272 -1200 =72. Exactly matches. \n\nSo that's correct.

And compound interest is calculated on the principal plus the accumulated interest from previous periods. \n\nWait, the question says the difference between the two is Rs.72. Maybe there's a shortcut formula for the difference between CI and SI for two years. Let me think. Oh right! The difference between CI and SI for two years is given by (P*(r/100)^2). Because for two years, the CI formula is P*(1 + r/100)^2 - P, which would be P[(1 + r/100)^2 -1]. The SI is P*r*2/100.
