      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this age problem. Hmm, the question says that Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. And now, we have to find Ajay's current age given that Sachin will be 40 in 10 years. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the information. The key points are:\n\n1. Ten years ago, Sachin's age was twice Ajay's age at that time.\n2. In 10 years from now, Sachin will be 40. So, I can figure out Sachin's current age first.\n\nWait, let me start with the second point. If in 10 years Sachin is 40, that means his current age is 40 minus 10, right? Because adding 10 years to his current age gives 40. So 40 -10 =30. So Sachin is 30 now?\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, if in 10 years he will be 40, that means now he is 30. Because 30 +10 =40. Yeah, that's correct. So Sachin's current age is 30.\n\nNow, going back to the first part. Ten years ago, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay was then. Let me set up variables here. Let me denote Ajay's current age as A. Then, ten years ago, Ajay was A -10 years old. And Sachin, who is currently 30, would have been 30 -10 =20 years old then.\n\nSo, according to the problem, at that time (10 years back), Sachin's age was twice Ajay's. So 20 = 2*(Ajay's age then). Ajay's age then was (A-10). So equation: 20 = 2*(A -10). Let me write that down properly.\n\nEquation: 30 -10 = 2*(A -10). Wait, Sachin's age 10 years ago was 20, which equals twice Ajay's age then. So:\n\n20 = 2*(A -10)\n\nSolving for A. Let's do that:\n\nDivide both sides by 2: 10 = A -10\n\nThen add 10 to both sides: A =20. So Ajay's current age would be 20. Wait, but looking at the options, D is 20. So that would be the answer?\n\nWait a second, let me check again. Let me verify.\n\nSo if Ajay is 20 now, then 10 years ago he was 10. Sachin was 20 then (since he's 30 now). So 20 is indeed twice 10. That checks out. And in 10 years, Sachin will be 40. That's correct. So Ajay's current age is 20, which is option D. Hmm. Let me check the options again. The options are A)18, B)25, C)15, D)20, E)21. So D is 20. That seems right. Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations?\n\nLet me rephrase the problem again to be sure. Ten years back, Sachin was twice Ajay's age. So Sachin's age then = 2 * Ajay's age then.\n\nSachin's current age is 30 (since in 10 years he's 40). So 10 years back, he was 20. So 20 = 2*(Ajay's age then). So Ajay's age then was 10. Therefore, Ajay is now 10 +10 =20. Yep, that's correct. So the answer must be D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here? Like, maybe the question is worded differently. Let me read it again.\n\n\"Conclude your response with a single line containing the answer letter formatted exactly as 'Answer: $LETTER'.\"\n\nWait the question is exactly as I thought. So I think D is correct. Let me check the options again. D is 20. So I think that's the right answer. I don't see any errors in the reasoning here. So yeah, the answer should be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by determining Sachin's current age. Since Sachin will be 40 in 10 years, his current age is \\(40 - 10 = 30\\) years.\n\nNext, we analyze the information about their ages 10 years ago. Ten years ago, Sachin was \\(30 - 10 = 20\\) years old. At that time, he was twice as old as Ajay. Let Ajay's current age be \\(A\\). Ten years ago, Ajay's age was \\(A - 10\\).

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years?\" The options are A to E.\n\nAlright, let's parse the information step by step. Let me denote their current ages. Let me assign variables. Let's say Sachin's current age is S, and Ajay's current age is A. That makes sense.\n\nFirst part: \"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back.\" Ten years back means 10 years ago. So, Sachin's age then would be S - 10, and Ajay's age then would be A - 10. The statement says that at that time, Sachin's age was twice Ajay's. So the equation would be: S - 10 = 2*(A - 10). Got that.\n\nSecond part: \"Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.\" So in 10 years, his age will be S + 10 = 40. Wait, solving that would give his current age. Let me compute that first. If S + 10 =40, then S = 40 -10 =30. So Sachin is currently 30 years old. Oh right, so S is 30.\n\nNow, going back to the first equation. Since we know S is 30, plug that into the first equation. Let's do that:\n\nS -10 = 2*(A -10)\n30 -10 = 2*(A -10)\n20 = 2*(A -10)\nDivide both sides by 2: 10 = A -10\nAdd 10 to both sides: A = 20.\n\nSo Ajay's current age is 20? Let me check the options. Option D is 20. So the answer would be D?\n\nWait, let me verify again to be sure. Let's see:\n\nIf Ajay is 20 now, then 10 years ago he was 10. Then Sachin was twice as old, so 20 years old then. But Sachin is currently 30, so 10 years ago he was 20. Yes, that matches. And in 10 years, Sachin will be 40, which fits. So that checks out. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me check if I interpreted the first part correctly.
