      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is about a boy trying to climb a staircase with 10 steps. He can take either one or two steps at a time, and we need to find out how many different ways he can reach the top. The options are from 88 to 92, so I need to figure out which one is correct.\n\nHmm, I remember this might be a classic dynamic programming problem. Like, the number of ways to reach step n is the sum of the ways to reach step n-1 (if he takes a single step from there) and the ways to reach step n-2 (if he takes a double step from two steps below). So it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let me think through that.\n\nLet's see, for the base cases: if there's 0 steps (like the ground), there's 1 way (do nothing). For 1 step, he can only take one step, so 1 way. For 2 steps, he can do 1+1 or 2, so 2 ways. Then for 3 steps, it's the sum of 2 and 1, which is 3. Wait, yeah, that's Fibonacci. So the pattern is each step's count is the sum of the previous two.\n\nSo let's build this up step by step. Let me list them out:\n\nNumber of steps: 0 \u2192 1 way (base)\n1 \u2192 1\n2 \u2192 2 (1+1 or 2)\n3 \u2192 3 (1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1)\n4 \u2192 3+2 =5\n5 \u21925+3=8\n6 \u21928+5=13\n7 \u219213+8=21\n8 \u219221+13=34\n9 \u219234+21=55\n10 \u219255+34=89.\n\nWait, so the 10th step would have 89 ways. Looking at the options, B is 89. So the answer should be B?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the indexing is off? Let me double-check. Let's see:\n\nn=1:1\nn=2:2\nn=3:3\nn=4:5\nn=5:8\nContinuing up:\n\nn=6:13, n=7:21, n=8:34, n=9:55, n=10:89. Yep, that's right. So the answer should be B)89. The options include that. \n\nWait, but sometimes people start the Fibonacci sequence at F(0)=0, F(1)=1, so maybe the count here is shifted? Let me think. The number of ways for n steps is actually the (n+1)th Fibonacci number. Because for n=1 step, it's 1, which would be F(2) if F(1)=1, F(2)=1. Hmm, maybe there's confusion here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first term is considered as step 0. Let me see the standard approach. The problem is similar to the number of compositions of n using 1 and 2, which is indeed Fibonacci(n+1). Wait, let me confirm with small n:\n\nFor n=1, the number is 1 (F(2)=1)\nn=2: 2 (F(3)=2)\nn=3:3 (F(4)=3)\nSo yes, the formula is Fib(n+1). So for n=10 steps, it would be Fib(11). Let's see:\n\nFibonacci numbers starting with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13, Fib(8)=21, Fib(9)=34, Fib(10)=55, Fib(11)=89. Exactly. So 11th term is 89, which matches the previous calculation. So the answer is 89, which is option B. That's one of the choices. So I think that's correct.\n",

We need to find out how many different ways he can reach the top. Hmm, right. I remember this might be a classic dynamic programming problem, like the stairs problem. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should start with smaller numbers of steps and see if I can find a pattern. Like, if there was 1 step, obviously there's only one way: take a single step. For 2 steps, he could do two single steps or one double step, so that's 2 ways. \n\nLet me list out some possibilities. Let's see:\n\nNumber of steps, n: 1 \u2192 1 way (A)\nn=2 \u2192 2 ways (1+1 or 2)\nn=3? Hmm, let's see. For 3 steps, the first move could be a 1 step, leaving 2 steps, which we know has 2 ways. Or the first move could be a 2 step, leaving 1 step, which has 1 way. So total is 2 +1 =3 ways. So for n=3, it's 3 ways.\n\nn=4? Following the same logic. After taking 1 step, there are 3 steps left (which is 3 ways), and after taking 2 steps, there are 2 steps left (2 ways).

So each term is the sum of the two previous terms. \n\nSo the pattern here is that the number of ways for n steps is equal to the (n)th Fibonacci number, but maybe shifted by one. Let me see:\n\nWait, the standard Fibonacci sequence is 1,1,2,3,5,8... So for n=1, the first term is 1. But here:\n\nn=1 \u21921 (same as Fib(1))\n\nn=2 \u21922 (Fib(3)), since Fib(3) is 2. Wait, maybe it's offset. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the number of ways for n steps is Fib(n+1). Let's check:\n\nFor n=1, Fib(2)=1? Wait, maybe the Fib numbering here is different. Let me get the exact mapping.\n\nAlternatively, let's define f(n) as the number of ways for n steps.\n\nThen f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). Because to get to step n, you could have come from n-1 (taking a single step) or from n-2 (taking a double step). \n\nThe base cases would be f(0) = 1 (there's one way to stay at the ground, do nothing), f(1)=1. \n\nWait, maybe that's the key here. Because if you think of f(0) as the base case being 1, then f(1)=1, f(2) = f(1)+f(0)=2, which matches. Then f(3)=f(2)+f(1)=3, etc. So the sequence would be f(0)=1, f(1)=1, f(2)=2, f(3)=3, f(4)=5, f(5)=8, f(6)=13, f(7)=21, f(8)=34, f(9)=55, f(10)=89. \n\nWait so for 10 steps, the number of ways would be f(10) = 89.

Let's compute each step step by step up to 10. \n\nStarting with:\n\nf(0) = 1 (base case)\nf(1) = 1\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1 +1 = 2\nf(3) = f(2)+f(1) = 2+1=3\nf(4) = 3+2=5\nf(5)=5+3=8\nf(6)=8+5=13\nf(7)=13+8=21\nf(8)=21+13=34\nf(9)=34+21=55\nf(10)=55+34=89. \n\nYes, that's 89.
