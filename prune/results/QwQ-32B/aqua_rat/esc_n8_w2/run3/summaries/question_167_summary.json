      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two printers, A and B. Each can print 1/2 a page per second. The question is asking how long it will take both of them working together to print 100 pages. Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with rates, especially combined rates, you add their individual rates together. \n\nFirst, let me think about each printer's rate. The problem says each printer can do 1/2 page per second. So Printer A's rate is 0.5 pages per second, and Printer B's rate is also 0.5 pages per second. If they work together, their combined rate should be the sum of their individual rates. So adding those together: 0.5 + 0.5 equals 1 page per second. Oh, right! So together, they can print 1 full page every second. \n\nNow, the question is how long to print 100 pages. If they can do 1 page per second, then for 100 pages, it would take 100 seconds, right? Because time is equal to the total work divided by the rate. Let me write that out to be sure. \n\nTotal pages needed: 100. Combined rate is 1 page/sec. So time = 100 / 1 = 100 seconds. Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it step by step. Each printer's rate is 1/2 page per second. So in one second, Printer A does 0.5, Printer B does 0.5. Together, in one second, that's 1 page. So yeah, that's correct. So for 100 pages, it's 100 seconds. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 100 seconds. But hold on, wait a second. Let me check the options again. The options are A)25, B)50, C)100, D)200, E)400. So according to my calculation, the answer should be C. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think of another way. Suppose each printer can do 1/2 page per second, so the time per page for each is 2 seconds per page. But when working together, their combined rate would be... Hmm, maybe I should use the formula 1/A + 1/B? Wait no, that's for when you have times and need to find combined time. \n\nWait, the standard formula is: If two things work together, their rates add. So rate A + rate B = total rate. \n\nRate A is 1/2 pages per second, same for B. So total rate is 1 page per second. So yes, 100 pages would take 100 seconds. So the answer is C. \n\nHmm, but sometimes these problems can be tricky. Let me think again. Suppose they each print half a page every second. So after 1 second, together they have 1 page. So after t seconds, they have t pages. So to get 100 pages, t must be 100. That's straightforward. \n\nI don't see any complications here. The answer must be C. \n",

The question is asking how long it will take them both working together to print 100 pages. The options are given from A to E. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with rates, like work rates, you can add them together when things are working simultaneously. So, maybe I need to find the combined rate of both printers and then figure out the time needed for 100 pages.\n\nEach printer's rate is 1/2 page per second. So Printer A does 0.5 pages every second, and Printer B is the same. If they work together, their rates should add up. Let me add those two rates: 1/2 + 1/2. That equals 1 page per second. Oh, right, because 0.5 plus 0.5 is 1. So together, they can print 1 full page each second.\n\nNow, the question is how long to print 100 pages. If they can do 1 page per second, then for 100 pages, time is just the total pages divided by the rate. So time = 100 pages / 1 page per second. That would be 100 seconds. Wait, but let me check the options. Option C is 100 seconds, so that's one of the choices. But hold on, maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I confused the rates. Let me write it down properly. \n\nPrinter A's rate: 1/2 page per second.\nPrinter B's rate: 1/2 page per second.\nCombined rate = (1/2 + 1/2) = 1 page per second. \n\nTotal work needed is 100 pages.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in adding the rates?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of time per page. Each printer takes 2 seconds per page (since 1/2 page per second means 2 seconds per page). But when working together, the combined time per page would be less. Wait, but when you have two things working together, the rates add. \n\nAlternatively, the formula is 1/(1/a + 1/b) for combined time? Wait no, that's when you have times and you need to find combined rate. Let me recall the correct formula. \n\nThe standard way is: if a printer can do a job in t time, its rate is 1/t per unit time. So if Printer A can print 1/2 page per second, then to print 1 page it takes 2 seconds. But maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, their rates are additive. Since each does 0.5 pages per second, together 1 page per second. So yeah, 100 pages would take 100 seconds. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but the options include 50 seconds as B. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see. Let me think differently. Suppose each printer can print half a page each second. So in one second, together they print 1 page. So after 1 second, 1 page done. So for 100 pages, 100 seconds. That seems right. So why is there an option B as 50? Maybe I'm missing something here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about pages per second each. So if both are working together, their rates add. So 0.5 +0.5 =1 page per second. So 100 pages would take 100 seconds. So the answer is C. So I think that's correct. So why would someone think it's 50? Maybe miscalculating the combined rate as adding the times instead of the rates. Like if each takes 2 seconds per page, then combined time is 1/(1/2 +1/2) = 1/1 = 1 second per page. Which gives the same result. So yes, 100 seconds. So answer must be C.\n",
