      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here. Let me read it again. The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000, and the sum of the numbers is 1,000. The options are given, and I need to pick the correct one. Hmm, let's think.\n\nFirst, I remember that the difference of squares formula is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). Oh right! Since they gave the sum of the numbers, which is 1000, that's the (a + b) part. So maybe I can plug that into the formula.\n\nSo the problem says that a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = 256,000. According to the formula, that's equal to (a + b)(a - b). We know a + b is 1000, so substituting that in, we get 1000*(a - b) = 256,000. \n\nTo find (a - b), I can divide both sides by 1000. Let me do that: 256,000 divided by 1000 is 256. So (a - b) must be 256. \n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. a + b = 1000\n2. a - b = 256\n\nHmm, I can solve these two equations by adding them together. If I add the left sides: (a + b) + (a - b) = 2a. And the right sides: 1000 + 256 = 1256. So 2a = 1256 \u2192 a = 628. Then substituting back, b would be 1000 - 628 = 372. \n\nWait, so the numbers should be 628 and 372. Let me check the options. Option B is exactly that. But hold on, let me verify the difference of their squares to be sure.\n\nCalculating 628 squared minus 372 squared. Alternatively, since we know (a + b)(a - b) should equal 256,000. Let's see: 1000 * 256 is indeed 256,000. So that checks out. But maybe I should compute the squares just to be thorough.\n\nLet me compute 628 squared. 600 squared is 360,000. 28 squared is 784. Then cross term 2*600*28 is 33,600. So total is 360,000 + 33,600 + 784 = 394,384. \n\nNow 372 squared: 300\u00b2 is 90,000. 72\u00b2 is 5,184. Cross term 2*300*72 = 43,200. So adding those: 90,000 +43,200 = 133,200 +5,184 is 138,384. \n\nSubtracting 394,384 - 138,384 gives exactly 256,000. Perfect, that matches. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options just in case. Let's see option C is 640 and 360. Their sum is 1000. Let me compute their squares difference. 640\u00b2 -360\u00b2. Alternatively, (640-360)*(640+360) = 280 *1000 = 280,000. Which is more than 256k. So that's not right. \n\nOption A: 600 and 400. Their difference is 200. 200 *1000 =200,000. Not enough. So B is correct. Therefore, the answer must be B. But wait, the options include D) None of these. Wait, the options given are A, B, C, D, E. Let me check again. The problem says \"the numbers are\" and the options include B as 628,372. Which we found correct. So why would D be the answer? Unless there's a miscalculation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nWait, let me recheck the equations. The difference between the squares is (a^2 - b^2)=256000. The sum is a + b =1000. So (a + b)(a -b) = 256000 \u2192 1000*(a -b) =256000 \u2192 a -b = 256. So solving the two equations:\n\na + b =1000\n\na -b =256\n\nAdding them gives 2a =1256 \u2192 a =628, then b =1000-628=372. So the numbers are 628 and 372. Which is exactly option B. So the answer must be B. Then why is option D there? Maybe the options are wrong? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the squaring?\n\nWait, let me recalculate 628 squared again. Let's compute 628 squared step by step. 628 * 628. Let's break it down:\n\n(600 +28)^2 = 600\u00b2 + 2*600*28 +28\u00b2\n\n600\u00b2 is 360,000. 2*600*28 is 2*16,800 = 33,600. 28\u00b2 is 784. So total is 360,000 +33,600 = 393,600 plus 784 gives 394,384. \n\n372 squared: (300+72)^2 =300\u00b2 +2*300*72 +72\u00b2 =90,000 + 43,200 +5,184 = 90,000+43,200 is 133,200 +5,184 is 138,384. \n\n394,384 minus 138,384 is exactly 256,000. So that's correct. So B is indeed the right answer. Therefore, the correct option is B. So why would D be an option? Unless the question is a trick question. Wait, the options include D as \"None of these\". But B is present and correct. So the answer should be B. Therefore, the correct choice is B.\n",

The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one. Let me think step by step.\n\nHmm, the problem states that the difference of their squares is 256,000. I remember that the difference of squares formula is a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 = (a - b)(a + b). Oh right, and the sum of the numbers is given as 1000. So maybe I can use these two pieces of information together.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as x and y. Let's say x is the larger one, so x + y = 1000, and x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 256000. According to the formula, x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 factors into (x - y)(x + y). Since we know the sum (x + y) is 1000, substituting that into the equation gives:\n\n256000 = (x - y) * 1000\n\nSo to find (x - y), I can divide both sides by 1000.

The options given are A)600,400; B)628,372; C)640,360; D) None of these. Since B is correct, D is not needed. So the answer is B. Therefore the correct answer is B. I think that's solid. So I'll go with B.\n\n\nThe problem states that the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256,000 and their sum is 1,000. Let the numbers be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), with \\( x > y \\). Using the difference of squares formula:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - y^2 = (x - y)(x + y)\n\\]\n\nGiven \\( x + y = 1000 \\) and \\( x^2 - y^2 = 256,000 \\), substitute the sum into the equation:\n\n\\[\n256,000 = (x - y) \\cdot 1000 \\implies x - y = \\frac{256,000}{1000} = 256\n\\]\n\nNow, solve the system of equations:\n1. \\( x + y = 1000 \\)\n2. \\( x - y = 256 \\)\n\nAdding these equations:\n\\[\n2x = 1256 \\implies x = 628\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( x = 628 \\) back into \\( x + y = 1000 \\):\n\\[\ny = 1000 - 628 = 372\n\\]\n\nThe numbers are 628 and 372, which matches option B. Verifying option C (640, 360) using the difference of squares formula gives \\( (640 - 360)(640 + 360) = 280,000 \\), which does not equal 256,000. Thus, option B is correct.\n\nAnswer: B",
