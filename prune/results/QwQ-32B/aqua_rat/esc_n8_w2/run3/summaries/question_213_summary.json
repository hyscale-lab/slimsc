      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about John's car color survey. Hmm, so first, I need to parse all the information given. Let's start by breaking down each part step by step.\n\nThe question states that 60% of the survey participants were women. That means the remaining 40% are men, right? Because 100% minus 60% equals 40%. So the total number of people is split into women (60%) and men (40%). \n\nNow, of the men surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green. Wait, so that leaves 25% of the men who preferred green over red. Because 100% minus 75% is 25%. The problem also says that 10 men liked green more than red. So those 10 men represent that 25%. \n\nLet me write down the variables to make this clearer. Let\u2019s let T be the total number of people who took the survey. Then the number of men would be 40% of T, so Men = 0.4 * T. \n\nOut of those men, 25% preferred green. So the number of men who liked green is 25% of the Men. That would be 0.25 * Men. And that equals 10. \n\nPutting this into an equation: 0.25 * (0.4*T) = 10. \n\nLet me check that again. The 25% of the men's total (which is 40% of T) equals 10. Yes. \n\nSo solving for T: \n\n0.25 * 0.4 * T = 10  \nMultiply 0.25 and 0.4 first. 0.25 * 0.4 is 0.1. So 0.1*T = 10. \n\nThen T would be 10 divided by 0.1, which is 100. Wait, but 10 divided by 0.1 is 100? Wait, yes, because 0.1 times 100 is 10. \n\nHmm, but let me double-check. Let's see:\n\nIf total is 100 people, then 60% women (60 women) and 40 men. Then 75% of those 40 men preferred red, so 75% of 40 is 30. The remaining 25% (which is 10 men) preferred green. Oh, exactly the 10 mentioned. So that works out. \n\nWait, so then the answer would be 100? But the options include A)100 and D)200. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me redo the equation step. Let me see:\n\nThe number of men is 0.4*T. The number of men who like green is 25% of that, which is 0.25*(0.4*T) = 0.1*T. That's equal to 10. So 0.1*T =10 \u2192 T=10 /0.1 = 100. So that's correct. So the total is 100, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me check the options again. The options are A)100, B)120, C)50, D)200, E)80. So 100 is an option, so that would be A. \n\nHmm, but let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me re-read the question:\n\n\"Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars. If 10 men liked green cars more than red, how many people took the survey?\"\n\nYes, so the 10 men are exactly the 25% who didn't prefer red. So the calculation seems right. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question says \"preferred red over green\" and \"liked green more than red\". So the 75% prefer red, so 25% prefer green, so that's correct. \n\nSo the math adds up. So total is 100, so the answer should be A)100. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the percentages. Let me check with another approach. Let's say the total number of people is T. \n\nNumber of men is 0.4*T. Let me call the number of men M. So M = 0.4*T. \n\nOf those M men, 75% prefer red, so 25% prefer green. The number preferring green is 0.25*M =10. \n\nSo 0.25*M =10 \u2192 M=10 /0.25 = 40. \n\nSo the number of men is 40. Since M is 40% of T, then 40 =0.4*T \u2192 T=40 /0.4 = 100. \n\nYes, that's the same result. So the answer is 100, which is A. \n\nHmm, but why is option D)200 there? Did I misread the percentage? Wait maybe the 75% is of all participants, but no, the question says \"Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars.\" So it's only among the men. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again step by step. \n\nSuppose total people T. \n\nWomen: 60% \u2192 0.6T. Men: 0.4T. \n\nMen preferring green: 25% of men \u2192 0.25*(0.4T) = 0.1T. \n\nThis equals 10 \u2192 0.1T =10 \u2192 T=100. \n\nYes, so the answer is A. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is tricky in some way. For example, maybe \"preferred red over green\" and \"liked green more than red\" are different? No, that's the same as preferring red vs preferring green. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 75% preferred red over green, but maybe there's a third option? The question says \"preferred red cars over green cars\" which I took to mean they prefer red to green, so the remaining 25% prefer green to red. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A)100. So the correct option is A.\n",

So if I can find out how many men there are in total, maybe I can work out the numbers. Also, it mentions that 10 men liked green more than red. Wait, since 75% preferred red, then the remaining percentage that preferred green would be 25%, right? Because those are the only two options here\u2014red or green. So 100% - 75% = 25% of the men preferred green.\n\nSo, if 25% of the men equals 10 people, then I can set up an equation. Let me call the total number of men M. Then 25% of M is 10. So 0.25 * M = 10. To find M, I can divide both sides by 0.25. That gives M = 10 / 0.25. Let me calculate that: 10 divided by 0.25 is the same as 10 multiplied by 4, which is 40. So there are 40 men in total.\n\nNow, since the men make up 40% of the total survey participants, I can let the total number of people be P. So 40% of P is equal to the number of men, which we found to be 40. So 0.4 * P = 40. To find P, divide both sides by 0.4. 40 divided by 0.4 is... let's see, 0.4 times 100 is 40, so 40 divided by 0.4 is 100. Wait, no, that would be 100? Wait, 0.4 times 100 is 40.

Let me write that equation:\n\n0.25 * (0.4P) = 10\n\nMultiply those numbers: 0.25 *0.4 is 0.1. So 0.1P =10. Then P =10 /0.1 =100. Yep, that's correct. So the total number of people is 100, so the answer is A.\n\nBut wait, why is there an option B)120? Did I miscalculate? Let me check again.
