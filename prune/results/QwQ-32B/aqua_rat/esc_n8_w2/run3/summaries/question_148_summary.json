      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is asking for the value of log base 2 of 4. Hmm, I need to remember what logarithms are. Let's think. A logarithm log_b a is the exponent you need to raise base b to get a. So log2 4 means 2 raised to what power gives 4?\n\nRight, 2 squared is 4 because 2 times 2 is 4. So the exponent here is 2. That would mean the answer is 2, which is option A. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the options. The options are A)2, B)4, etc. So yeah, A is the first option. \n\nWait another thought\u2014could there be a trick here? Like maybe the question is written differently? No, the question is straightforward. Log base 2 of 4. So 2^x =4. Solving for x, x is 2. So the answer must be A. Let me check the other options. B is 4, which would be if someone thought the log base 4 of 2, but that's 1/2. No, so B isn't right. The others are higher numbers. So definitely A is correct.\n",
