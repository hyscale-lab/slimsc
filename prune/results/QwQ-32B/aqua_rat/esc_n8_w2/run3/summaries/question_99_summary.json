      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Meenu's weight, right? Silu says she weighs 51 kgs, but the question is about Meenu. Meenu doesn't want to tell directly, but gives a clue: \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\n\nWait, the way she says it is: \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" So, let me try to translate that into an equation. Let me denote Meenu's weight as, say, M. \n\nSo according to her statement: M = 29 + (1/2)*M. Because she's saying her total weight is 29 plus half of her own weight. \n\nWait, but if I set up the equation like that, I can solve for M. Let's do that. Subtract half of M from both sides. So M - (1/2)M = 29. That simplifies to (1/2)M = 29. Then multiplying both sides by 2 gives M = 58. Oh, so that would make her weight 58? Let me check the options. Option D is 58. So that's a possible answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The wording was a bit tricky. The statement is \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" So when she says \"half of my weight,\" that refers to half of her own current weight. So the equation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could misread it as 29 plus half of Silu's weight? But that doesn't make sense because the problem states that Meenu is talking about her own weight. So the equation M = 29 + (1/2)M is right. Solving that gives M=58, which is option D. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)12, B)28, C)27, D)58, E)91. So D is there. But let me think again. Suppose I made a mistake in the equation. Let's see:\n\nSuppose Meenu's weight is M. Then according to her statement:\n\nTotal weight = 29 + (half of her weight). \n\nSo M = 29 + 0.5*M\n\nSubtract 0.5*M from both sides:\n\n0.5*M = 29\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nM = 58. Yep, that's correct. So the answer must be D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another way. Suppose someone thought the equation was different. Like, maybe they thought \"29 plus half of Silu's weight,\" but that would be 29 + (51/2) = 29 +25.5 =54.5, which isn't any of the options. So that can't be. So the correct interpretation is definitely about Meenu's own weight. \n\nAnother possible mistake: if someone thought the equation was M = 29 + (half of 29?), but that would be different. But that's not what the problem says. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is presented in a different way. Let me re-express the problem again. The problem states that Meenu's weight is 29 plus half of her own weight. So that's exactly the equation I used. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D)58.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nMeenu's weight can be determined by setting up an equation based on her statement. Let \\( M \\) represent her weight.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Meenu's weight. Silu says she weighs 51 kg, but the question is about Meenu. Meenu doesn't want to say her weight directly because she's overweight. Instead, she says, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing. Wait, how does that work?\n\nLet me parse the sentence again. Meenu's statement is: \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" So if I let her weight be some number, maybe I can set up an equation here. Let me think. Let's call Meenu's weight 'x' kilograms. Then according to her statement, her total weight (x) is equal to 29 plus half of her own weight. So in equation form, that would be x = 29 + (1/2)x. \n\nWait, that seems like an equation I can solve. Let's do that. Subtract (1/2)x from both sides to get x - (1/2)x = 29. That simplifies to (1/2)x = 29. Then multiplying both sides by 2 gives x = 58. Oh, so that would make Meenu's weight 58 kg. Let me check the options. Option D is 58, so that's probably the answer. \n\nBut hold on, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The way Meenu phrased it might be tricky. She said \"29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" So if her total weight is 29 plus half of her own weight, then the equation is correct. Because half of her weight plus 29 equals her total. So solving that gives 58. Let me test it. If her weight is 58, then half of that is 29. So 29 (the given number) plus 29 (half her weight) equals 58. Yep, that works. So that checks out. \n\nLooking at the options again: D is 58. The other options don't fit. Let's see what the other options would give. For example, if someone thought the equation was x = 29 + (1/2 of 29), that would be wrong. Let's see: 29 plus 14.5 is 43.5, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe someone might have set up the equation wrong. Like x/2 = 29 + x, which would lead to a negative, but that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could have thought that the \"half of my weight\" refers to Silu's weight? But the problem states that Meenu is talking about her own weight. The problem says \"half of my weight\" where \"my\" refers to Meenu. So that part is okay. \n\nSo yeah, the correct answer should be D)58. Let me check the options again. The options are A)12, B)28, C)27, D)58, E)91.
