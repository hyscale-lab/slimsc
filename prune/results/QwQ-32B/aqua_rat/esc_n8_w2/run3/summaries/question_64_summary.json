      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about Sachin's batting average in the IPL season. His current average is 51, and after scoring 78 runs in the finals, his average becomes 54. We need to find the total number of matches he played this season. \n\nWait, batting average is calculated as total runs divided by the number of matches, right? Or wait, actually, isn't it total runs divided by the number of outs? Because in cricket, if a batsman hasn't been out, their innings isn't counted towards the average. But the problem here mentions \"matches played\"\u2014maybe the question is simplifying it by considering each match as an innings, assuming he was out in each? Or maybe the question is treating each match as an innings regardless. Since the problem states \"matches played\" and \"batting average,\" perhaps we can proceed under the assumption that each match he played, he batted once, and each of those counts as an innings. So the average is total runs divided by number of matches played. \n\nSo let me restate the problem. Let\u2019s denote the number of matches he has played before the final as 'n'. His current total runs before the final would be 51 times n, because average = total runs / number of matches. \n\nThen, in the final, he scores 78 runs. So his new total runs will be 51n + 78. The number of matches after the final will be n + 1. The new average is given as 54. So the equation would be:\n\n(51n + 78) / (n + 1) = 54\n\nWe can solve for n here. Let's do that. Multiply both sides by (n+1):\n\n51n + 78 = 54(n +1 )\n\nExpanding the right side: 54n + 54\n\nNow, subtract 51n from both sides:\n\n78 = 3n +54\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides: 24 = 3n \u2192 n = 8. \n\nSo before the final, he had played 8 matches, and after the final, it's 9 matches. The question asks for the total number of matches played in the season, which would be 8+1=9. Wait, but the options include 9 as option C. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me redo the steps:\n\nStarting equation:\n\n(51n +78) = 54*(n+1)\n\nSo expanding the right side gives 54n +54.\n\nSo subtract 51n: 78 = 3n +54 \u2192 78-54 = 3n \u2192 24 =3n \u2192 n=8. So yes, n is 8 matches before the final, so total matches including the final is 9. So the answer should be C)9. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)9, D)10, E)11. So C is 9, which matches. But wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says \"current batting average is 51\" \u2014 this is before the finals. Then in the finals, he scores 78, so after that, the average becomes 54. The question is asking for the total matches played in the season, which includes the final. So yes, the calculation is correct. The initial matches are n, then after adding the final, it's n+1. So the answer should be 9. So option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the \"current\" average before the final already includes all matches up to before the final, so the total after the final is n +1. Therefore the answer would be 9. So the correct option is C.\n",
