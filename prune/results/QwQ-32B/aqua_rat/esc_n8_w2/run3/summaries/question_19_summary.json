      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. The question gives me some averages and the number of students. Hmm, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the average score for the entire class is y, and there are z students. So the total sum of all the scores must be z multiplied by y. That makes sense because average is total divided by the number of items. So total = z*y.\n\nNow, the problem mentions the average of the highest and lowest score is x. Since that's the average of two numbers, the sum of the highest and lowest scores would be 2x. Because average is (high + low)/2 = x, so multiplying both sides by 2 gives high + low = 2x.\n\nThe question asks for the average excluding those two students. So, I need to subtract those two scores from the total and then divide by the remaining number of students. The total number of students excluding the highest and lowest is z - 2. \n\nSo the total of the remaining students' scores would be (total of all) minus (highest + lowest) which is zy - 2x. Then the average would be that divided by (z-2). So putting that together, the formula should be (zy - 2x)/(z - 2). Let me check the options.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is exactly that: (zy \u2013 2x)/(z -2). Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, let's confirm again. Total of all scores is zy. Subtract the highest and lowest (sum 2x) gives zy - 2x. The number of students left is z-2. So average is (zy-2x)/(z-2). Yep, that's D. The other options don't fit. Like option A is divided by z, but that's not right because after removing two, the denominator should be z-2. Option C has zx in the numerator which isn't right because the total is zy. So D must be correct.\n",

Hmm, the question is asking for the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. The answer needs to be in terms of x, y, and z. Let me see what each of those variables represent.\n\nThe problem says that the average of the highest and lowest score is x. Oh right, so the average of two numbers is (highest + lowest)/2 = x. So if I want the sum of the highest and lowest, that would be 2x. Got that part.\n\nThen the average score for the entire class is y, and there are z students. So the total sum of all the scores in the class must be y multiplied by z. Because average is total divided by number of students, so total is average times number. So total = y*z.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the average when we exclude the highest and lowest. So first, I need to find the total of all the scores except those two, then divide by the number of students left, which is z minus 2.\n\nLet me write that down. The total of all scores is y*z. If I subtract the highest and the lowest, which together add up to 2x, then the remaining total is y*z - 2x. Then the number of students left is z-2. So the average would be (y*z - 2x)/(z - 2). \n\nLooking at the options, let me check each one. Option D is (zy - 2x)/(z -2), which matches exactly what I have here. Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through again.\n\nThe average of highest and lowest is x, so their sum is 2x. The total of all students is z*y. Subtract the two extremes gives total of (zy - 2x). The number of students excluding those two is z-2, so dividing gives (zy-2x)/(z-2). Yep, that's D. Let me check the other options just in case.\n\nOption A is (zy - 2x)/z. That would be if you were keeping the two extremes and dividing by z, but we need to exclude them. So no. Option B has a minus 2 but without the x term, so probably not. Option C has (zx - y) which doesn't seem right because we have zy, not zx. Option E has z+2 in the denominator, but we should have z-2. So D is definitely the right one. I think that's it.\n",
