      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about Jerry buying a bond with a face value of $5,000, an annual interest rate of 12%, compounded every six months. We need to find the interest accrued at maturity after one year. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that compound interest is calculated using the formula A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after time t, P is principal, r is the annual rate, n the number of times compounded per year, and t the time in years. The interest accrued would be A minus P.\n\nLet me break down the numbers here. The principal P is $5,000. The annual rate r is 12%, which is 0.12 as a decimal. Since it's compounded every six months, that's twice a year, so n=2. The time t is 1 year. \n\nSo plugging into the formula: A = 5000*(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1). Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. Adding 1 gives 1.06. Then the exponent is 2*1 = 2. So 1.06 squared. What's 1.06 squared? Let me calculate that: 1.06 * 1.06. 1*1 is 1, 1*0.06 is 0.06, 0.06*1 is 0.06, and 0.06*0.06 is 0.0036. Adding those up: 1 + 0.06+0.06 +0.0036 = 1.1236. Wait, actually, maybe I should just multiply 1.06 times 1.06 directly. 1.06 *1.06: 106*106 is 11236, so moving the decimal four places, that's 1.1236. Right. \n\nSo A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let me compute that. 5000 *1.1236. Let's break it down: 5000 *1 =5000, 5000*0.12 is 600, and 5000*0.0036 is 18. Adding those together: 5000 +600 is 5600, plus 18 gives 5618. Wait, but wait, 0.1236 is 0.12 +0.0036? Hmm, actually, 1.1236 is 1 +0.1236, so 5000*(1.1236) is indeed 5000*1.1236. Alternatively, 5000 multiplied by 1.1236: 5000*1 =5000, 5000 *0.12 is 600, 5000*0.0036 is 18. So total is 5000+600+18 =5618. \n\nTherefore, the total amount after one year is $5,618. The interest accrued is A minus P, which is 5618 -5000 = $618. \n\nLooking at the options, B is $618. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way: since it's compounded semiannually, each six months, the interest is 6% (half of 12%). So after six months, the interest would be 5000 *0.06 = 300. So the new principal is 5300. Then the next six months: 5300 *0.06 = 318. Adding that gives 5300 +318 =5618. Total interest 618. Yep, that matches. So B is correct. The options given have B as $618, so that's the right answer.\n",

Since it's compounded every six months, that's twice a year, so n=2. The time t is 1 year. \n\nSo plugging into the formula: A = 5000*(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1).

Wait, but wait, 0.1236 is 0.12 +0.0036? Hmm, actually, 1.1236 is 1 +0.1236, so 5000*(1.1236) is indeed 5000*1.1236. Alternatively, 5000 multiplied by 1.1236: 5000*1 =5000, 5000 *0.12 is 600, 5000*0.0036 is 18. So total is 5000+600+18 =5618. \n\nTherefore, the total amount after one year is $5,618. The interest accrued is A minus P, which is 5618 -5000 = $618. \n\nLooking at the options, B is $618. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Another way: since it's compounded semiannually, each six months, the interest is 6% (half of 12%). So after six months, the interest would be 5000 *0.06 = 300. So the new principal is 5300.

The annual interest rate is 12%, but it's compounded every six months. The question is asking how much interest it accrued at maturity. Alright, so I need to calculate the total interest after one year with semi-annual compounding.\n\nFirst, I remember that compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt). Let me make sure I have the variables right. Here, P is the principal, which is $5,000. The annual rate r is 12%, so 0.12. Since it's compounded every six months, n is 2 times a year. The time t is 1 year. \n\nSo plugging into the formula: A = 5000*(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1). Let me compute the numbers step by step. \n\n0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So each compounding period has a rate of 6%. Then, the exponent is 2*1 = 2. So the formula becomes 5000*(1.06)^2. \n\nWait, let me calculate (1.06)^2 first. 1.06 squared is 1.1236. So then, multiplying that by 5000 gives the total amount. Let me compute 5000 * 1.1236. \n\nHmm, 5000 times 1.12 is 5600, right? And then 5000 * 0.0036 is 18. So adding those together, 5600 + 18 = 5618. Wait, actually, maybe a better way is 5000 * 1.1236. Let's do it more accurately. 1.1236 multiplied by 5000. Let's see: 1.1236 * 5000. \n\nBreaking it down: 1 * 5000 = 5000, 0.1236*5000. 0.1 *5000 is 500, and 0.0236 *5000 is 118. So 500+118=618. So total is 5000 + 618 = 5618. \n\nSo the total amount at maturity is $5,618. The question asks for the interest accrued, so subtract the principal. 5618 - 5000 = 618. So the interest is $618. Let me check the options. Option B is 618. So that must be the answer.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me recalculate. The first six months: 5000 at 6% gives 5000 * 0.06 = 300 interest. So after six months, the amount is 5300. Then the next six months, the interest is 5300 * 0.06. Let's see: 5300 * 0.06 is 318. So total after a year is 5300 + 318 = 5618. Yep, that's the same as before. So the total interest is 618. So the correct answer should be B.\n",
