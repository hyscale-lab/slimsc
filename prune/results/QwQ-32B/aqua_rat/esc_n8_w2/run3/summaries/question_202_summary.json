      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. So the problem is about files infected by viruses or worms, and I need to find how many weren't infected by a worm. Hmm, all 250 files are infected by either one or both. Let me parse the details again.\n\nThe question says the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. Let me note that down. Let's denote:\n\nLet V be the set of files with virus, W with worm. The total is 250.\n\nThe number only worm (so W but not V) is 2.5 times the number in both. Let me use variables. Let's let B be the number infected by both. Then the only worm is 2.5B.\n\nThen the total number of worm-only plus both would be W = 2.5B + B = 3.5B? Wait, no, no. Wait, the worm-only is 2.5B, and both are B, so total worm is 3.5B? Wait, maybe. But then we also have virus-only files. \n\nThe problem also states that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% not infected by a virus means that half of 250, which is 125 files, are not in V. So those 125 must be the ones only in W, right? Because if they're not in V, they could be in W only or neither, but the problem says all are infected by either virus or worm or both. So all files are in at least one. So the 125 not infected by virus are exactly the ones only in W. \n\nSo that means the only worm count is 125. Wait, but earlier we had that the only worm count is 2.5 times B. So 2.5B = 125. Let me check that again.\n\nWait, the problem states: \"the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.\" So yes, only worm (W only) is 2.5 times both. So W only = 2.5 * B. And since the number not infected by virus is exactly the W only (since they can't be in both either?), then that's 125 = 2.5B. So solving for B, B = 125 / 2.5 = 50. \n\nSo both virus and worm are 50 files. Then the worm only is 125. So total worm infections are 125 +50 =175. \n\nNow, the total files are 250. So the ones not infected by a worm would be total minus worm (either only or both). So 250 - 175 = 75. Wait, but let me verify again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a Venn diagram. Let me structure this properly. Let me define:\n\nLet V be virus, W worm.\n\nTotal = V \u222a W = 250 (since all are in at least one). \n\nWe are told that the number of files only in W (W \\ V) is 2.5 times the number in both (V \u2229 W). Let me denote:\n\nOnly W = 2.5x, Both = x. \n\nThen, the total number not in V is the only W, which is 2.5x. The problem says that 50% of files (so 125) are not infected by virus, so 2.5x = 125 \u2192 x = 50. \n\nThus both are 50, only W is 125. \n\nNow, the total in V is (only V) + both. The total in V is total minus only W. Wait, total in V would be 250 - only W (since only W is the ones not in V). Wait no, total in V is (only V) + both. Since the total not in V is 125 (only W), so total in V is 250 - 125 = 125. \n\nSo, Only V = total in V minus both \u2192 125 -50 =75. \n\nNow, the question asks how many were NOT infected by a worm. That would be the only V (since they are in virus but not worm) plus those in neither. But wait, the problem says all 250 are infected by either virus or worm or both. So there are no files in neither. So the only ones not in W are the only V. \n\nSo the number not infected by worm is only V =75. So answer is 75? Which is option C. \n\nWait, let me check again. Let me add all the numbers:\n\nOnly V:75, Both:50, Only W:125. Total:75+50+125=250, which matches. \n\nThe question is \"how many were NOT infected by a worm?\" So that's the ones not in W. Which is only V (75). So the answer should be C. \n\nHmm. The options are given as A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125. So C is correct. I think that's right.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we have 250 files total, all infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The question is asking how many files were not infected by a worm. \n\nFirst, I need to remember the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Let me recall: the total number in two sets is the sum of each set minus their intersection. So, for Virus (V) and Worm (W), the formula would be:\n\nTotal = V + W - Both\n\nBut the problem mentions \"infected only by a worm\" is 2.5 times the number infected by both. Let me parse that. Let's denote:\n\nLet B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm. Then, the number infected only by worm is 2.5*B. \n\nWait, right. Because \"only worm\" would be those in W but not in V, so W_only = W_total - B. So according to the problem, that's 2.5 times B. So W_only = 2.5B.\n\nAlso, the problem says 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. 50% of 250 is 125. So 125 files are not infected by a virus. But those not infected by virus would be the ones only infected by worm plus those not infected by either. Wait, but the problem states all files are infected by either virus or worm or both. Wait, that's important. The first sentence says all 250 are infected by virus or worm or both. So there are no files uninfected. Therefore, the 50% not infected by virus must be exactly the ones infected only by worm. Because if they're not infected by virus, they must be only worm. \n\nAh, so the \"not infected by virus\" is exactly the \"only worm\" group. Therefore, that number is 125. So according to the problem, the number of only worm is 2.5 times the both. So:\n\nOnly Worm = 2.5 * Both = 125. \n\nSo solving for Both: Both = 125 / 2.5 = 50. \n\nSo Both is 50. Then, the number of only worm is 125, as we just found. \n\nNow, let's get the total number of virus-infected files. Virus total is Only Virus plus Both. Let me denote Only Virus as V_only. \n\nTotal Virus (V) = V_only + Both. \n\nBut total files can also be expressed as Only Virus + Only Worm + Both. Which equals 250. \n\nWe know Only Worm is 125, Both is 50. So Only Virus + 125 +50 = 250 \u2192 Only Virus = 250 - 175 =75. \n\nTherefore, the number of files not infected by a worm would be the ones only infected by virus. Wait, no. Wait, the question is asking for files not infected by a worm. So that would be the ones only infected by virus plus those not infected by either. But since all files are infected by at least one, the ones not infected by worm are exactly the ones only infected by virus. Because if they're not infected by worm, they must be only virus. \n\nSo the answer is V_only, which is 75. Let me check the options. Option C is 75. So that's the answer?\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. Let me go through the steps again. \n\nTotal files:250. All are in V, W, or both. \n\nGiven that 50% (125) are not infected by virus. Since all files are infected by something, those 125 must be the ones only in W. So only worm is 125. \n\nThe problem states that only worm is 2.5 times both. So 125 =2.5 * Both \u2192 Both =50. \n\nThen, the virus-only is total minus (only W + both). So 250 - (125+50)=75. So virus-only is 75. \n\nThe question is how many are not infected by a worm. That would be the virus-only (75) plus any that are neither. But since all are infected by at least one, the answer is 75. So option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the \"infected by both\" part. Let me check the wording again. \n\n\"The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.\" \n\nYes, so only worm is 2.5 * both. So that's correct. \n\nAnd the 50% not infected by virus: since virus is the complement, those not in virus are exactly the only worm. So that part is right. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 75, which is option C. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125.
