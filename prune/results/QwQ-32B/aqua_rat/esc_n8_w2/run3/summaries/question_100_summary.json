      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about Roy taking 5 tablets every 15 minutes. Hmm, wait, no. Wait, the doctor told him to take one tablet every 15 minutes. So he has 5 tablets total. The question is, how long does it take him to consume all five?\n\nHmm, sometimes these problems can be tricky because of the way the intervals work. Let me think. Like, if you take the first tablet at time zero, then the next one after 15 minutes, and so on. So for example, if there were 2 tablets, taking one every 15 minutes would take 15 minutes total, right? Because first at 0, then the second at 15. So the time between the first and second is 15, but the total time from first to last is 15. \n\nSo applying that to 5 tablets. Let's list the times each tablet is taken. Let's say he takes the first tablet at time 0. The second at 15, third at 30, fourth at 45, fifth at 60. Wait, that would be 60 minutes total? Because the fifth is at 60 minutes. So from the first to the fifth, the time elapsed is 60 minutes. Wait, but how many intervals are there between the tablets? Between 5 tablets, there are 4 intervals. Because each interval is between two tablets. So 4 intervals of 15 minutes each would be 4 * 15 = 60 minutes. But then the total time from the first to the last is 60. But wait, that would make the answer E)60 Min. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the question says \"how much time will it take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets?\" So the total time starts when he takes the first tablet and ends when he takes the last one. So if he takes the first at 0, the second at 15, third at 30, fourth at 45, fifth at 60. The total time from start to finish is 60 minutes. So the answer should be E)60. But wait, the options include E as 60 and A is 45. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the intervals. Let me see again.\n\nThe number of intervals between tablets is the number of tablets minus one. So 5 tablets would have 4 intervals. Each interval is 15 minutes, so 4 *15 is 60. So the total time is indeed 60. So the answer should be E. But wait, maybe the question is a trick question where the first tablet is considered to take effect immediately, but the time starts counting after the first? No, I think the standard way is that the first is at time zero, then the next after 15, etc. So the fifth would be at 60 minutes. So the total time from the first to the last is 60 minutes. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)45, B)75, C)90, D)120, E)60. So E is 60, which matches. So the answer must be E. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think of a smaller example. Like 3 tablets. If you take one every 15 minutes, how long? The first at 0, second 15, third 30. So total time is 30 minutes. Which is (3-1)*15 =30. So yes, the formula holds. So 5 tablets would be (5-1)*15=60. So the answer is E. But I remember sometimes people get confused between the number of intervals and the total. Like if someone says \"every 15 minutes\", then after taking the first, the next is after 15, etc. So yeah, the answer must be E. But wait, I've seen similar problems where the answer is different. Wait, maybe the question is how long until he finishes all the tablets, meaning from the first to when the last one is taken. Which would be 60. But let me see the options again. Oh, the options are given as E)60, so that's correct. So the answer is E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how long it takes Roy to consume all 5 tablets when taking one every 15 minutes, we analyze the intervals between doses. The key is recognizing that the number of intervals between tablets is one less than the total number of tablets. \n\n- **First tablet** is taken at time **0 minutes**.\n- **Second tablet** at **15 minutes** (1 interval).\n- **Third tablet** at **30 minutes** (2 intervals).\n- **Fourth tablet** at **45 minutes** (3 intervals).\n- **Fifth tablet** at **60 minutes** (4 intervals).\n\nThe total time spans **4 intervals** (since \\(5 - 1 = 4\\)), each lasting 15 minutes:  \n\\[\n4 \\times 15 = 60 \\text{ minutes}.\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **E)60 Min**, as the final tablet is taken at the 60-minute mark.\n\nAnswer: E",
