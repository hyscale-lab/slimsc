      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the height of a room given some ratios and cost information. Hmm. The ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter? So semi-perimeter probably refers to half the perimeter of the floor, right? Because the walls are around the room, so the perimeter would be the total length around the room, and the semi might be half of that. Let me think again. The perimeter of the floor (which is a rectangle, I suppose) is length plus width times two. So semi-perimeter would be (length + width) since that's half the perimeter. Oh right, so the height divided by (length + width) is 2/5. So height = (2/5)*(length + width). Got that.\n\nThen, the cost to paper the walls is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, and the price is Rs.2 per meter. Also, they allow 15 sq.m for doors and windows, so that area isn't papered. So the total area to be papered is the lateral surface area of the room minus 15. \n\nFirst, I need to find the lateral surface area. The lateral surface area of a room (assuming it's a rectangular prism) would be the perimeter of the floor times the height. Because each wall's area is height multiplied by the length or width, and adding all four walls gives 2*(length + width)*height. So perimeter is 2*(length + width), so the lateral area is perimeter * height. Wait, no, perimeter is 2*(l + w), so the lateral area is 2*(l + w)*h. So the total area to be covered is that minus 15.\n\nThe cost is given, so I can relate that to the area. Let me write down the given data step by step.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet h be the height. The semi-perimeter (l + w) is such that h/(l + w) = 2/5. So h = (2/5)*(l + w). \n\nTotal cost is Rs.260. The cost is calculated based on the area of the paper used. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter of paper (I think per meter length? Wait, the question says \"Rs.2 per meter\". Hmm, maybe it's per square meter? Wait, the paper is 50cm wide. So each meter of the paper (in length) would cover an area of 0.5 meters (width) times 1 meter (length) = 0.5 square meters. Wait, perhaps the cost is Rs.2 per meter in length of the paper? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cost is Rs.2 per square meter of the paper. But the problem states \"paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter\". Hmm, maybe the price is per meter in length? So each meter of the paper (since it's 50cm wide) would cost Rs.2. So for each meter of length of the paper, the area covered would be 0.5 m * 1 m = 0.5 m\u00b2, and the cost per square meter would be (Rs.2)/0.5 m\u00b2 = Rs.4 per m\u00b2? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost is Rs.2 per running meter of the paper. Since the paper is 50 cm wide, a running meter would be a meter in length, so the area per running meter is 0.5 m\u00b2. So the cost per square meter of the paper would be 2 / 0.5 = Rs.4 per m\u00b2. So the total cost would be (total area) * 4? But maybe the question is phrased as \"Rs.2 per meter\" where the meter is the length. Let me parse the question again:\n\n\"costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the cost is Rs.2 per meter in length of the paper. So each meter of the paper (length) costs Rs.2, and since the paper is 0.5 meters wide, each meter of length gives 0.5 m\u00b2 of coverage. Therefore, the total cost would be (total area needed / 0.5) * 2. Because for each 0.5 m\u00b2, you need 1 meter of paper length, costing Rs.2. Wait, maybe better to think:\n\nTotal area needed (after subtracting 15) is A = (perimeter * height) - 15. \n\nThe paper required to cover this area would be (A) / (width of paper) in terms of length? Because the area is length of paper * width of paper. So the length of paper needed is (A) / (0.5 m). Because width is 0.5 m. \n\nSo the cost is (length of paper) * Rs.2 per meter. \n\nPutting it all together:\n\nCost = ( ( (Perimeter * height - 15 ) ) / 0.5 ) * 2 \n\nWait let's compute that step by step. \n\nPerimeter is 2*(l + w). The lateral surface area is perimeter * height. Subtract 15 gives the area to be covered. \n\nThe area to be covered (A) is (perimeter * h) -15.\n\nThe area is equal to (length of paper * width of paper). The width of the paper is 0.5m, so the length of paper required is A / 0.5.\n\nThe cost per meter of paper length is Rs.2. Therefore total cost is (A / 0.5) * 2.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nTotal cost = [ ( (perimeter * h) -15 ) / 0.5 ] * 2 \n\nWait let's see:\n\nLet me write the formula:\n\nTotal cost = ( (Total area required) / (width of paper) ) * (cost per meter of paper length)\n\nTotal area required = (perimeter * h) -15.\n\nThe length of the paper needed is (Total area required) / (width) = ( (perimeter*h -15) ) / 0.5 m.\n\nThe cost per meter of paper's length is Rs.2, so total cost is:\n\n( ( (perimeter*h -15 ) /0.5 ) ) * 2 \n\nSimplify this:\n\n( (perimeter*h -15 ) /0.5 ) * 2 = (perimeter*h -15) * (2/0.5) ) = (perimeter*h -15)*4 \n\nBecause dividing by 0.5 is multiplying by 2, and then multiply by 2 again, so 2*2=4.\n\nTherefore, total cost = 4*(perimeter*h -15) = 260.\n\nSo equation: 4*(perimeter*h -15) = 260.\n\nDivide both sides by 4: perimeter*h -15 = 65 \u2192 perimeter*h = 80.\n\nNow, perimeter is 2*(l + w), so perimeter * h = 2*(l + w)*h.\n\nBut from the ratio given: height is 2/5 of the semi-perimeter (l + w). \n\nWait the ratio is height : semi-perimeter = 2:5. So h/(l + w) = 2/5 \u2192 h = (2/5)(l + w). \n\nSo, (l + w) = (5/2) h. \n\nTherefore, perimeter = 2*(l + w) = 2*(5/2 h) ) = 5h. \n\nSo perimeter is 5h. \n\nTherefore, perimeter * h = 5h * h = 5h\u00b2. \n\nSo from earlier equation: perimeter*h =80 \u2192 5h\u00b2 =80 \u2192 h\u00b2 =16 \u2192 h =4 m. \n\nWait, that would give h =4 meters. Which is option C. But let me check again. \n\nWait let me retrace:\n\nEquation after substituting perimeter as 5h (since perimeter is 2*(l +w) and (l +w) is (5/2)h). So 2*(l +w) is 2*(5/2 h) =5h. \n\nThus perimeter * h is 5h\u00b2. \n\nSo equation: 5h\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 h\u00b2 =16 \u2192 h=4. \n\nSo the height is 4 meters, which is option C. \n\nHmm. Let me check if I made any mistake in the cost calculations. \n\nWait the cost equation: \n\nTotal cost = 4*(perimeter*h -15) =260. \n\nSo 4*(something)=260 \u2192 something is 65. \n\nSo perimeter*h -15 =65 \u2192 perimeter*h =80. \n\nYes, that part seems okay. \n\nThen, substituting perimeter as 5h, gives 5h\u00b2 =80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4. \n\nSo the answer is C)4m. \n\nWait but let me check if another approach would get a different result. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the cost. Let me re-express the cost calculation again. \n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. The paper is 50 cm wide. So each meter of paper (in length) has an area of 0.5 m\u00b2. \n\nSo the cost per square meter of paper would be (Rs.2 per meter length) divided by 0.5 m\u00b2 per meter length \u2192 2/0.5 = Rs.4 per m\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, total cost would be (total area) *4. \n\nTotal area needed is (perimeter * h -15). \n\nThus, total cost is 4*(perimeter*h -15) =260 \u2192 same equation. So same result. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. \n\nWait the options include 4m. So that's the answer. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)2.6m\n\nB)3.9m\n\nC)4m\n\nD)4.2m\n\nE)4.4m\n\nYes, C is 4m. \n\nHmm, but let me check if the semi-perimeter is indeed (l + w). Because sometimes semi-perimeter could be half of the perimeter. Wait perimeter is 2(l +w), so semi-perimeter would be (l +w). So the ratio given is h/(semi-perimeter) = 2/5 \u2192 h/(l +w) =2/5. So that part is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \n\nWait but let me think again. Suppose the semi-perimeter was half the perimeter, then the semi-perimeter would be (l +w). So the ratio h/(l +w) =2/5. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, all steps seem okay. So I think the correct answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about the height of a room related to its semi-perimeter, and the cost of papering the walls. I need to find the height. Let me start by understanding the given information.\n\nFirst, the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, what's semi-perimeter here? Since it's a room, which is a rectangular prism, the perimeter would be the sum of all the sides around the floor, right? But semi-perimeter would probably be half of that? Or maybe just the sum of length and width? Wait, perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width), so semi-perimeter might mean (length + width). Yeah, that makes sense. Because then the ratio given is height : (length + width) = 2:5. So let me note that down.\n\nLet me denote the height as h. Then the semi-perimeter (which I'll call S) would be length plus width. So h/S = 2/5. So h = (2/5)*S. That's equation one.\n\nNow, the next part: the cost to paper the walls is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, priced at Rs.2 per meter. And they allow 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So the total area to be papered is the area of the walls minus the 15 sq.m.\n\nThe area of the walls (the lateral surface area) would be the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height, right? Since each wall's area is length*height or width*height, adding all four gives 2*(length + width)*height. So that's 2*(length + width)*h. Wait, but that's the total area of the four walls. But since the semi-perimeter (S) is length + width, then the total area would be 2*S*h. \n\nBut we have to subtract the 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So the effective area to be covered is (2*S*h -15).\n\nNow, the cost is calculated based on the amount of paper used. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter. Wait, per meter of what? Probably per meter of length of the paper, since the width is 50 cm. So the cost per meter of length (since each meter of the paper's length would give an area of 0.5 m\u00b2, because 0.5 m width *1m length).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cost is given as Rs.2 per meter of the paper's length. Let me think: the cost is given as Rs.2 per meter. So for each meter of the paper's length, the cost is Rs.2. The area of each meter of paper would be 0.5 m *1m = 0.5 m\u00b2. So the cost per square meter would be (Rs.2)/(0.5 m\u00b2) = Rs.4 per m\u00b2. Wait, maybe that's another way to look at it. Alternatively, perhaps the cost is directly calculated by the total length of paper needed multiplied by the cost per meter (since each meter length gives 0.5 m width). \n\nHmm, let me think again. The problem says \"costs Rs.260 to paper the walls... with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter\". So the price is per meter of the paper's length. So the total cost would be (total length of paper needed) * (Rs.2 per meter). \n\nThe total area of paper required is (2*S*h -15). Since each meter of paper's length gives 0.5 m\u00b2 (because 50 cm is 0.5 meters wide), then the length of paper needed would be (total area) / (0.5 m\u00b2 per meter length). \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nTotal area needed = (2*S*h -15) \n\nTotal length of paper required = (Total area)/0.5 \n\nCost = (Total length) * 2 (since Rs.2 per meter of length)\n\nSo the cost equation would be:\n\nCost = [ (2*S*h -15) / 0.5 ] * 2 = (2*S*h -15) * 4 \n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. Let's see:\n\nTotal area required is (2Sh -15). \n\nEach meter of paper (length) gives 0.5 m\u00b2. So to get the required area, the length needed is (Total area)/0.5. \n\nThen, the cost is (length) * 2 (since each meter of length costs Rs.2). \n\nSo cost = [ (2Sh -15)/0.5 ] *2 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(2Sh -15)/0.5 is the same as (2Sh -15)*2. \n\nMultiply that by 2 again? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, (Total area)/0.5 gives the length. Then multiply by 2 (the cost per meter of length). \n\nSo:\n\nTotal cost = [ (2Sh -15) / 0.5 ] * 2 \n\nSo (2Sh -15) divided by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2, so (2Sh -15)*2. Then multiply by 2 again? Wait no:\n\nWait, (2Sh-15)/0.5 = 2*(2Sh-15). Because dividing by 0.5 is multiplying by 2. Then multiply that by 2 (the cost per meter length):\n\nSo total cost is 2*(2Sh-15)*2 ?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the steps here. Let me re-express this:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nTotal area to cover: A = 2Sh -15\n\nEach meter of paper's length gives area of 0.5 m\u00b2 (since width is 0.5 m). So the number of meters of paper needed is A / 0.5 = 2A.\n\nEach meter of paper costs Rs.2, so total cost is (2A) * 2 = 4A.\n\nSo total cost is 4*(2Sh -15) = 4*(2Sh -15).\n\nGiven that the total cost is 260, so:\n\n4*(2Sh -15) = 260\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n4*(2Sh -15) = 260\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n2Sh -15 = 65\n\nAdd 15 to both sides:\n\n2Sh = 80\n\nSo Sh = 40.\n\nNow, remember from the first ratio:\n\nh/S = 2/5 \u2192 h = (2/5)S \u2192 so S = (5/2)h\n\nWait, substituting S in terms of h into Sh=40?\n\nWait, wait, let's see. Wait, S is the semi-perimeter, which is length + width. So S is a variable here, and h is the height. \n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) h/S = 2/5 \u2192 h = (2/5) S \u2192 which can be rearranged as S = (5/2) h\n\n2) From the cost equation, we found that Sh = 40 (since 2Sh =80 \u2192 Sh=40). \n\nSo substituting S from equation 1 into equation 2:\n\nSh =40 \u2192 ( (5/2) h ) * h =40 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait S is (5/2) h, so S multiplied by h is (5/2 h)*h = (5/2) h\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, no, sorry, Sh is S multiplied by h. Wait S is (5/2) h. So:\n\nSh = (5/2 h) * h = (5/2) h\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, no, that would be if S = (5/2) h, then S*h is (5/2 h)*h = (5/2) h\u00b2. \n\nWait but according to equation 2, Sh =40. \n\nSo (5/2) h\u00b2 =40 \u2192 h\u00b2 = (40 *2)/5 = 16 \u2192 h\u00b2 =16 \u2192 h=4 meters. \n\nWait, but then the answer would be C)4m? Let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait let's retrace:\n\nThe cost equation:\n\nTotal cost is 4*(2Sh -15) = 260 \u2192 2Sh -15 = 65 \u2192 2Sh =80 \u2192 Sh=40. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThen S = (5/2)h (since h/S=2/5 \u2192 cross multiply, 5h=2S \u2192 S=5h/2 )\n\nSo substituting into Sh=40:\n\n(5h/2)*h =40 \u2192 (5h\u00b2)/2 =40 \u2192 5h\u00b2 =80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4. \n\nSo h is 4 meters. So option C is the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check the options given. The options are A)2.6, B)3.9, C)4, D)4.2, E)4.4. So yes, C is 4. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make an error in the cost calculation. Let me verify the cost part again. \n\nTotal area of walls is 2*(length + width)*h = 2Sh. But subtract 15 gives (2Sh -15). \n\nThe paper is 50 cm wide, so each meter of paper length gives 0.5 m\u00b2. So the required length is (2Sh-15)/0.5. \n\nThen the cost is that length multiplied by Rs.2 per meter. \n\nSo the cost is [(2Sh-15)/0.5] * 2. \n\nLet me compute that again: \n\n(2Sh-15)/0.5 = 2*(2Sh -15). Because dividing by 0.5 is multiplying by 2. \n\nThen multiply by 2 (the cost per meter length): \n\nTotal cost = 2*(2Sh -15) *2? Wait no, no. Wait:\n\nWait the length is (2Sh-15)/0.5, which is (2Sh-15) divided by 0.5, which is equal to 2*(2Sh -15). \n\nThen multiply that length by the cost per meter (which is Rs2 per meter). \n\nSo total cost is [2*(2Sh -15)] *2? \n\nWait, no. Wait, sorry, the cost per meter of the paper's length is Rs2. So total cost is (length) * 2. \n\nThe length is (2Sh-15)/0.5. \n\nSo total cost = [ (2Sh-15)/0.5 ] * 2 \n\nWhich is equal to (2Sh -15) * (2/0.5) ? Wait no, let me compute step by step. \n\nLet me compute (2Sh -15)/0.5 first. That's (2Sh -15) divided by 0.5, which equals 2*(2Sh -15). \n\nThen multiply that by 2 (the cost per meter of length):\n\nTotal cost = [2*(2Sh -15)] *2? Wait no, wait, sorry:\n\nWait the length is (2Sh-15)/0.5. The cost per meter of that length is 2. So total cost is (length) * (2). \n\nSo:\n\nTotal cost = ( (2Sh-15)/0.5 ) * 2 \n\nWhich is (2Sh-15) * (2 / 0.5) ? Wait no, 1/0.5 is 2. So (2Sh-15) *2 (from dividing by 0.5) multiplied by 2 again?\n\nWait no, sorry, let me re-calculate:\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nTotal cost = [ (Total area) / (width of paper) ] * cost per meter length. \n\nWait, because the length of the paper needed is (Total area) / (width of paper * 1 m per length?) Hmm maybe I confused something here.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nArea = length * width of the paper. \n\nThe paper's width is 50 cm = 0.5 m. So for each meter of length, the area covered is 0.5 m * 1 m = 0.5 m\u00b2. \n\nSo to cover A area, you need A / 0.5 m\u00b2 per meter length = 2A meters of paper length. \n\nThus, the total length needed is 2A. \n\nThen, the cost is (2A) * (Rs.2 per meter) = 4A. \n\nSo total cost is 4*(2Sh -15) = 260. \n\nWhich gives the same equation as before. So that's correct. \n\nSo solving that gives h =4m. Which is option C. \n\nHmm, but wait the options include 4m. So that's the answer. But let me check if I made any wrong assumption. \n\nWait, semi-perimeter: The problem says \"semi-perimeter\". For a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(l + w), so semi-perimeter would be (l + w). So yes, that's correct. \n\nAnother way to check: suppose the height is 4 meters. Then S (l + w) = (5/2)*h = (5/2)*4 =10. \n\nSo S=10. \n\nThen the total area of walls is 2*Sh = 2*10*4 =80. Subtract 15 gives 65. \n\nWait, but according to the calculation, the area to cover is 2Sh -15 = 80-15=65. \n\nThen the paper needed is 65/(0.5) meters length (since 0.5 m\u00b2 per meter length). \n\n65/0.5 is 130 meters. \n\nCost is 130 * 2 = 260, which matches the given cost. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore the answer should be C)4m.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about the height of a room related to its semi-perimeter, and the cost of papering the walls. I need to find the height. Let me start by understanding the given information.\n\nFirst, the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, what's semi-perimeter here? Since it's a room, which is a rectangular prism, the perimeter would be the sum of all the sides around the floor, right? But semi-perimeter would probably be half of that? Or maybe just the sum of length and width? Wait, perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width), so semi-perimeter might mean (length + width). Yeah, that makes sense. Because then the ratio given is height : (length + width) = 2:5. So let me note that down.\n\nLet me denote the height as h. Then the semi-perimeter (which I'll call S) would be length plus width. So h/S = 2/5. So h = (2/5)*S. That's equation one.\n\nNow, the next part: the cost to paper the walls is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, priced at Rs.2 per meter. And they allow 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So the total area to be papered is the area of the walls minus the 15 sq.m.\n\nThe area of the walls (the lateral surface area) would be the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height, right? Since each wall's area is length*height or width*height, adding all four gives 2*(length + width)*height. So that's 2*(length + width)*h. Wait, but that's the total area of the four walls. But since the semi-perimeter (S) is length + width, then the total area would be 2*S*h. \n\nBut we have to subtract the 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So the effective area to be covered is (2*S*h -15).\n\nNow, the cost is calculated based on the amount of paper used. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter. Wait, per meter of what? Probably per meter of length of the paper, since the width is 50 cm. So the cost per meter of length (since each meter of the paper's length would give an area of 0.5 m\u00b2, because 0.5 m width *1m length).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cost is given as Rs.2 per meter of the paper's length. Let me think: the cost is given as Rs.2 per meter. So for each meter of the paper's length, the cost is Rs.2. The area of each meter of paper would be 0.5 m *1m = 0.5 m\u00b2. So the cost per square meter would be (Rs.2)/(0.5 m\u00b2) = Rs.4 per m\u00b2. Wait, maybe that's another way to look at it. Alternatively, perhaps the cost is directly calculated by the total length of paper needed multiplied by the cost per meter (since each meter length gives 0.5 m width). \n\nHmm, let me think again. The problem says \"costs Rs.260 to paper the walls... with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter\". So the price is per meter of the paper's length. So the total cost would be (total length of paper needed) * (Rs.2 per meter). \n\nThe total area of paper required is (2*S*h -15). Since each meter of paper's length gives 0.5 m\u00b2 (because 50 cm is 0.5 meters wide), then the length of paper needed would be (total area) / (0.5 m\u00b2 per meter length). \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nTotal area needed = (2*S*h -15) \n\nTotal length of paper required = (Total area)/0.5 \n\nCost = (Total length) * 2 (since Rs.2 per meter of length)\n\nSo the cost equation would be:\n\nCost = [ (2*S*h -15) / 0.5 ] * 2 = (2*S*h -15) * 4 \n\nWait, let me check that calculation again. Let's see:\n\nTotal area required is (2Sh -15). \n\nEach meter of paper (length) gives 0.5 m\u00b2. So to get the required area, the length needed is (Total area)/0.5. \n\nThen, the cost is (length) * 2 (since each meter of length costs Rs.2). \n\nSo cost = [ (2Sh -15)/0.5 ] *2 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(2Sh -15)/0.5 is the same as (2Sh -15)*2. \n\nMultiply that by 2 again? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, (Total area)/0.5 gives the length. Then multiply by 2 (the cost per meter of length). \n\nSo:\n\nTotal cost = [ (2Sh -15) / 0.5 ] * 2 \n\nSo (2Sh -15) divided by 0.5 is the same as multiplying by 2, so (2Sh -15)*2. Then multiply by 2 again? Wait no:\n\nWait, (2Sh-15)/0.5 = 2*(2Sh-15). Because dividing by 0.5 is multiplying by 2. Then multiply that by 2 (the cost per meter length):\n\nSo total cost is 2*(2Sh-15)*2 ?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the steps here. Let me re-express this:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nTotal area to cover: A = 2Sh -15\n\nEach meter of paper's length gives area of 0.5 m\u00b2 (since width is 0.5 m). So the number of meters of paper needed is A / 0.5 = 2A.\n\nEach meter of paper costs Rs.2, so total cost is (2A) * 2 = 4A.\n\nSo total cost is 4*(2Sh -15) = 4*(2Sh -15).\n\nGiven that the total cost is 260, so:\n\n4*(2Sh -15) = 260\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n4*(2Sh -15) = 260\n\nDivide both sides by 4:\n\n2Sh -15 = 65\n\nAdd 15 to both sides:\n\n2Sh = 80\n\nSo Sh = 40.\n\nNow, remember from the first ratio:\n\nh/S = 2/5 \u2192 h = (2/5)S \u2192 so S = (5/2)h\n\nWait, substituting S in terms of h into Sh=40?\n\nWait, wait, let's see.

Wait S is (5/2) h, so S multiplied by h is (5/2 h)*h = (5/2) h\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, no, sorry, Sh is S multiplied by h. Wait S is (5/2) h. So:\n\nSh = (5/2 h) * h = (5/2) h\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, no, that would be if S = (5/2) h, then S*h is (5/2 h)*h = (5/2) h\u00b2. \n\nWait but according to equation 2, Sh =40. \n\nSo (5/2) h\u00b2 =40 \u2192 h\u00b2 = (40 *2)/5 = 16 \u2192 h\u00b2 =16 \u2192 h=4 meters. \n\nWait, but then the answer would be C)4m? Let me check the calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait let's retrace:\n\nThe cost equation:\n\nTotal cost is 4*(2Sh -15) = 260 \u2192 2Sh -15 = 65 \u2192 2Sh =80 \u2192 Sh=40. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nThen S = (5/2)h (since h/S=2/5 \u2192 cross multiply, 5h=2S \u2192 S=5h/2 )\n\nSo substituting into Sh=40:\n\n(5h/2)*h =40 \u2192 (5h\u00b2)/2 =40 \u2192 5h\u00b2 =80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4. \n\nSo h is 4 meters. So option C is the answer. \n\nWait, but let me check the options given. The options are A)2.6, B)3.9, C)4, D)4.2, E)4.4. So yes, C is 4. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make an error in the cost calculation. Let me verify the cost part again. \n\nTotal area of walls is 2*(length + width)*h = 2Sh. But subtract 15 gives (2Sh -15). \n\nThe paper is 50 cm wide, so each meter of paper length gives 0.5 m\u00b2. So the required length is (2Sh-15)/0.5. \n\nThen the cost is that length multiplied by Rs.2 per meter. \n\nSo the cost is [(2Sh-15)/0.5] * 2. \n\nLet me compute that again: \n\n(2Sh-15)/0.5 = 2*(2Sh -15). Because dividing by 0.5 is multiplying by 2. \n\nThen multiply by 2 (the cost per meter length): \n\nTotal cost = 2*(2Sh -15) *2? Wait no, no. Wait:\n\nWait the length is (2Sh-15)/0.5, which is (2Sh-15) divided by 0.5, which is equal to 2*(2Sh -15). \n\nThen multiply that length by the cost per meter (which is Rs2 per meter). \n\nSo total cost is [2*(2Sh -15)] *2? \n\nWait, no. Wait, sorry, the cost per meter of the paper's length is Rs2. So total cost is (length) * 2. \n\nThe length is (2Sh-15)/0.5. \n\nSo total cost = [ (2Sh-15)/0.5 ] * 2 \n\nWhich is equal to (2Sh -15) * (2/0.5) ? Wait no, let me compute step by step. \n\nLet me compute (2Sh -15)/0.5 first. That's (2Sh -15) divided by 0.5, which equals 2*(2Sh -15). \n\nThen multiply that by 2 (the cost per meter of length):\n\nTotal cost = [2*(2Sh -15)] *2? Wait no, wait, sorry:\n\nWait the length is (2Sh-15)/0.5. The cost per meter of that length is 2. So total cost is (length) * (2). \n\nSo:\n\nTotal cost = ( (2Sh-15)/0.5 ) * 2 \n\nWhich is (2Sh-15) * (2 / 0.5) ? Wait no, 1/0.5 is 2. So (2Sh-15) *2 (from dividing by 0.5) multiplied by 2 again?\n\nWait no, sorry, let me re-calculate:\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nTotal cost = [ (Total area) / (width of paper) ] * cost per meter length. \n\nWait, because the length of the paper needed is (Total area) / (width of paper * 1 m per length?) Hmm maybe I confused something here.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as:\n\nArea = length * width of the paper. \n\nThe paper's width is 50 cm = 0.5 m. So for each meter of length, the area covered is 0.5 m * 1 m = 0.5 m\u00b2. \n\nSo to cover A area, you need A / 0.5 m\u00b2 per meter length = 2A meters of paper length. \n\nThus, the total length needed is 2A. \n\nThen, the cost is (2A) * (Rs.2 per meter) = 4A. \n\nSo total cost is 4*(2Sh -15) = 260. \n\nWhich gives the same equation as before. So that's correct. \n\nSo solving that gives h =4m. Which is option C. \n\nHmm, but wait the options include 4m. So that's the answer. But let me check if I made any wrong assumption. \n\nWait, semi-perimeter: The problem says \"semi-perimeter\". For a rectangle, the perimeter is 2*(l + w), so semi-perimeter would be (l + w). So yes, that's correct. \n\nAnother way to check: suppose the height is 4 meters. Then S (l + w) = (5/2)*h = (5/2)*4 =10. \n\nSo S=10. \n\nThen the total area of walls is 2*Sh = 2*10*4 =80. Subtract 15 gives 65. \n\nWait, but according to the calculation, the area to cover is 2Sh -15 = 80-15=65. \n\nThen the paper needed is 65/(0.5) meters length (since 0.5 m\u00b2 per meter length). \n\n65/0.5 is 130 meters. \n\nCost is 130 * 2 = 260, which matches the given cost. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore the answer should be C)4m.\n\n\nThe problem states the ratio of the room's height (h) to its semi-perimeter (S = length + width) is 2:5.
