      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this three-digit number problem. Let me see. The question says the sum of the digits is 17, the sum of their squares is 109, and when you subtract 495 from the number, you get its reverse. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the three-digit number as ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B the tens, and C the units. So the actual number is 100A + 10B + C. The reverse would be 100C + 10B + A. The problem says that when you subtract 495 from the original number, you get the reversed number. So:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A.\n\nHmm, let's rearrange that equation. Subtract the right side from both sides:\n\n100A +10B + C - 495 - (100C +10B +A) =0\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(100A - A) + (10B -10B) + (C -100C) -495 =0\n\nSo that's 99A - 99C -495 =0\n\nDivide all terms by 99:\n\nA - C -5 =0 \u2192 A - C =5.\n\nSo that's one equation: A = C +5. Got that.\n\nNext, the sum of the digits is 17: A + B + C =17.\n\nSum of squares is 109: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\n1. A = C +5\n2. A + B + C =17\n3. A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into the others. Let's start with equation 2.\n\nSubstituting A = C+5 into equation 2:\n\n(C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C +5 + B =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B =12-2C.\n\nNow, equation 3: substitute A and B in terms of C.\n\nA is C+5, B is 12-2C. So:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25\n\nSecond term: (12-2C)^2 = ( -2C +12)^2 = (2C-12)^2 \u2192 4C\u00b2 -48C +144\n\nThird term: C\u00b2.\n\nAdding all three terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 +4C\u00b2 -48C +144 +C\u00b2 \n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2\n\n10C -48C =-38C\n\n25 +144 =169\n\nSo total: 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 = 109\n\nSubtract 109 from both sides: 6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Maybe divide all terms by 2?\n\n3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0\n\nHmm, quadratic equation. Let's see if it factors.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 3*30=90 and add to -19. Wait, maybe:\n\nWait, 3C\u00b2 -19C +30. Let me try factoring:\n\nLooking for factors of 3*30=90 that add to -19. Hmm. Since the middle term is -19 and the constant term is +30, the factors should both be negative.\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a*b = 90 and a +b =19. Let's see:\n\n9 and 10: 9+10=19. So yes. So split the middle term:\n\n3C\u00b2 -9C -10C +30=0\n\nGroup:\n\n(3C\u00b2 -9C) + (-10C +30) =0\n\n3C(C-3) -10(C-3)=0\n\nTake (C-3) common:\n\n(3C -10)(C -3) =0 \u2192 So solutions are C=10/3 or C=3.\n\nBut C is a digit (0-9), so 10/3 is not possible. So C=3.\n\nSo C is 3. Then from equation 1, A =3+5=8.\n\nThen B =12 -2C =12 -6=6.\n\nSo the digits would be A=8, B=6, C=3. So the number is 863? Wait, but looking at the options given:\n\nOptions are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. None of these is 863. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let's check the calculations again. Let me retrace.\n\nStarting from the quadratic equation:\n\nAfter substituting, the equation was 6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0. Divided by 2 gives 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0. Let me check the discriminant here.\n\nDiscriminant D= 19\u00b2 -4*3*30 = 361 - 360 =1. Wait, 361-360=1. So sqrt(1)=1. So solutions are [19 \u00b11]/6. \n\nWait, so (19+1)/6 =20/6=10/3, which is ~3.333, not integer. (19-1)/6=18/6=3. So that's correct. So C=3 is the only valid solution. Then A=8, B=6. So the number would be 863. But this isn't among the options. Hmm. So that suggests that either I made a mistake in the equations, or perhaps an error in substitution.\n\nWait let me check the equations again.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nThe first equation from subtracting 495 gives A - C =5. So that part is correct.\n\nSecond equation: A + B + C=17. Substituting A = C+5 gives (C+5) + B + C = 17 \u2192 2C + B +5 =17 \u2192 2C + B=12. That's correct.\n\nThird equation, sum of squares: (C+5)^2 + B^2 + C\u00b2 =109. And B is 12-2C.\n\nSo substituting B=12-2C into that:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 = ?\n\nLet me recalculate the expansion step again. Maybe I messed up here.\n\nFirst term (C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25.\n\nSecond term (12-2C)^2 = (12)^2 - 2*12*2C + (2C)^2 \u2192 144 -48C +4C\u00b2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThird term C\u00b2.\n\nAdding all three terms:\n\nC\u00b2+10C+25 +4C\u00b2 -48C +144 +C\u00b2 \u2192 \n\nTotal C\u00b2 terms: 1+4+1=6C\u00b2.\n\nC terms: 10C-48C= -38C.\n\nConstants:25+144=169.\n\nThus, 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109 \u2192 6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0 \u2192 dividing by 2: 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0. That's correct.\n\nHmm, so the solution is C=3, so the number is 8 6 3. But that's not an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation?\n\nWait, the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. Let me check with 863.\n\n863 - 495 = 368. The reverse of 863 is 368. So that's correct. Wait, 368 is option A. Wait, so the number is 863, but the reverse is 368 which is option A. But the question asks for the original number. So the options include 368 as option A, but the original number would be 863 which isn't listed. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait maybe I messed up the equation?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" So if the original number is ABC, the reverse is CBA. Wait, the equation I set up was:\n\nOriginal number minus 495 equals reversed number. So:\n\nABC (number) -495 = CBA (reverse). So 100A+10B+C -495 = 100C +10B +A.\n\nWait, when I subtract, let me check with 863:\n\n863 -495 = 368. And the reverse of 863 is 368. So that's exactly correct. So the original number is 863, but it's not among the options. The options given are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112.\n\nHmm, that suggests that maybe I made an error in the equations. Alternatively, perhaps there's another solution?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in solving the quadratic. Let me check again.\n\nThe quadratic was 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0. Let me compute the roots again.\n\nThe quadratic formula: C = [19 \u00b1 sqrt(361 - 360)]/(2*3) \u2192 sqrt(1)=1 \u2192 (19 \u00b11)/6.\n\nSo (19+1)/6 =20/6 \u22483.333, which is not an integer. (19-1)/6=18/6=3. So yes, only C=3 is valid. So the number must be 863, but that's not an option. The options given don't have that. So perhaps there's an error in my approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the equation. Let me check the equation again.\n\nThe problem says: subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So:\n\nNumber - 495 = reverse.\n\nSo, Number = reverse +495. Let's see for the options given, maybe one of them satisfies this.\n\nLet me check the options one by one.\n\nOption A is 368. Let's see: reverse is 863. 863 - 495 = 368. So 368 is the number? Wait, no. The original number would be 863, but the option is 368. So if the question is asking for the original number, then the answer isn't listed. But that can't be. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I flipped the equation. The problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So the equation is Number -495 = reverse. So the original number is bigger than the reverse by 495. Let me check the options:\n\nCheck option A)368. Its reverse is 863. 368 -495 would be negative. Not possible. So the original number must be larger than 495. So the number must be over 495. So possible options are B)377 (377-495 negative), C)288 (too small), D)997, E)112 (too small). So only D)997 is over 495.\n\nWait D is 997. Let me check if that works.\n\nOriginal number 997. Reverse is 799. 997 -495 =502. Which is not 799. So that's not right.\n\nWait option B is 377. Reverse is 773. 377-495 is negative, so no.\n\nOption C is 288. Reverse is 882. 288-495 is negative.\n\nHmm. So none of the options except D and maybe others? Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check the other options.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's equations. Let me try another approach. Let's check each option and see which one satisfies all conditions.\n\nOption A)368:\n\nDigits: 3,6,8.\n\nSum:3+6+8=17. That's good.\n\nSum of squares: 9+36+64= 109. That's correct.\n\nThen, subtract 495 from 368: 368-495= -127. Which is not the reverse (which would be 863). So that doesn't work. But the reverse is 863, so the original number must be 863, which is not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So if the original number is 863, subtract 495 gives 368, which is the reverse. So 863 is the correct number, but it's not listed. So that's a problem. The options don't have it. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the equations. Let me check another option.\n\nOption C)288:\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum is 2+8+8=18, which is not 17. So no.\n\nOption B)377:\n\nDigits 3+7+7=17. Sum is okay. Sum of squares:9+49+49=107. Not 109. Close but not right.\n\nOption D)997: digits 9+9+7=25. Not 17. So no.\n\nOption E)112: sum is 4. Nope.\n\nHmm. So the only candidate is option A (368) but it doesn't satisfy the subtraction part. Wait, but the problem says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. For option A, 368 -495 is negative, so that can't be. So maybe the correct answer is not listed? But that can't be. The problem must have an answer among the options. Did I make a mistake in the equations?\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem. Let me check the equations again. Maybe I made a mistake in the first equation.\n\nOriginal equation: the number minus 495 equals the reverse. So:\n\nOriginal number N = 100A +10B +C\n\nReverse R = 100C +10B +A\n\nSo N -495 = R \u2192 100A+10B+C -495 = 100C+10B+A \u2192 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A - C =5. That's correct. So A = C+5.\n\nSo the first equation is okay.\n\nSecond equation, sum A+B+C=17.\n\nThird equation, sum squares =109.\n\nSo with A=8, B=6, C=3, sum is 17, squares sum to 109. So that's correct. So the number is 863, which isn't listed. But the options include 368 (the reverse). Maybe the problem was stated incorrectly? Or perhaps I have a miscalculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the problem's condition. Let me read again.\n\n\"the sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.\"\n\nSo the problem requires the original number to satisfy all three conditions. The number 863 does that, but it's not an option. So maybe there's another solution?\n\nWait, the quadratic equation only had one valid digit solution (C=3). But maybe there's another way? Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the quadratic equation step.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the sum of squares step again, but using the variables:\n\nA = C+5, B =12-2C.\n\nSo A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2.\n\nLet me compute each term again:\n\n(C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25.\n\n(12-2C)^2 = (2C-12)^2 =4C\u00b2 -48C +144.\n\nC\u00b2.\n\nAdding them all:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 +4C\u00b2 -48C +144 + C\u00b2 = (1+4+1)C\u00b2 + (10C-48C) + (25+144).\n\nSo 6C\u00b2 -38C +169. Set equal to 109 \u2192 6C\u00b2-38C+60=0 \u2192 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the quadratic is right. Hmm. So the only solution is C=3, leading to 863.\n\nSince the options don't include it, maybe the problem had a typo, or perhaps I misread the options?\n\nLooking back at the options again:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)368\n\nB)377\n\nC)288\n\nD)997\n\nE)112\n\nHmm, 368 is the reverse of 863, which is the correct number. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the reversed number? But that wouldn't make sense because subtracting 495 from the original gives the reversed. So original is 863, reversed is 368. The question asks for the original number. Since it's not listed, perhaps the options are wrong. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, let me check another possibility. Suppose the equation was N - reverse = 495, but the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So N -495 = reverse \u2192 N - reverse =495. So the difference between the original and reverse is 495. Let me see what's the difference between 863 and 368: 863-368=495. Yes, that's correct. So that's correct. So the number is indeed 863, but the options don't have it. So perhaps there's another approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sum of squares? Let me check for option C)288:\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum is 18. Not 17.\n\nOption B:3+7+7=17. Sum squares: 9+49+49=107. Not 109. Close.\n\nOption A:3\u00b2+6\u00b2+8\u00b2=9+36+64=109. Wait a second! Wait, the sum of squares for 368 is exactly 109. The digits of 368 add to 17. Wait, but the number 368's digits are 3+6+8=17. Sum of squares is 109. So that's correct. But then why does the equation give 863?\n\nWait, hold on! Oh no! Maybe I got the direction wrong. Let me re-express:\n\nIf the original number is 368, then subtracting 495 would give a negative number, which isn't the reverse. But the problem states that subtracting 495 gives the reversed number. So 368-495 = -127, which is not the reverse. So that's invalid.\n\nBut 863-495=368, which is the reverse. So 863 is the correct original number. So why is option A 368?\n\nHmm. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the equations?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the interpretation of the reverse. Let me check if the reverse of 368 is 863, which it is. So the correct number is 863, but since it's not an option, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem says \"the reverse is obtained when you subtract 495\" but maybe the reverse is the original number minus 495? So if the original number is 368, then 368-495 would be negative. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the equations. Let me check another option. Let's try option C)288. Let's see:\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum is 18, which is over 17. So no.\n\nOption B)377: sum is 17. Sum squares:3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2= 9+49+49=107. Not 109. So close but not.\n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is option B)377 but the problem had a typo in the sum of squares?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me try plugging in the options.\n\nOption A)368:\n\nCheck the three conditions:\n\n1. Sum digits:3+6+8=17 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Sum squares:9+36+64=109 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. Subtract 495: 368-495 = -127. Not reverse (863). So \u274c.\n\nSo condition 3 fails.\n\nOption B)377:\n\n1. Sum:3+7+7=17 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Sum squares:9+49+49=107 \u274c (needs 109)\n\n3. Reverse is 773. 377-495= -118 \u274c.\n\nNo.\n\nOption C)288:\n\nSum:2+8+8=18 \u274c.\n\nOption D)997:\n\nSum:9+9+7=25 \u274c.\n\nE)112: Sum is 4 \u274c.\n\nSo none of the options except A and B meet two of the three conditions, but only A meets first two. But the third condition is crucial. So the only number that meets all three conditions is 863, which isn't listed. \n\nHmm. Did I make a mistake in the equations?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's suppose that the number is 368 (option A). Then the reverse is 863, and 368 + 495 = 863. Oh! Wait, maybe I reversed the equation. The problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So N -495 = reverse \u2192 N = reverse +495. So if N is 863, then reverse is 368, and 368 +495 =863. So that's correct. But the question asks for the number N, which is 863, but that's not an option. The options include 368, which is the reverse. So unless the problem is worded differently, like adding instead of subtracting?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says subtract the reverse from the number to get 495? Let me see:\n\nN - reverse =495. Which would give the same as before. So the equations are correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another solution where C is not an integer? But digits must be integers between 0-9.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation had another solution C=10/3 \u22483.333. Which is not an integer, so invalid. So no.\n\nHmm. Since none of the options work except for 863 which isn't listed, but the options given must have an answer, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first equation. Let me re-derive it again.\n\nOriginal number N = 100A +10B +C.\n\nReverse R = 100C +10B +A.\n\nThe problem says N -495 = R \u2192 N - R =495.\n\nSo N - R = (100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) = 99A -99C =99(A -C).\n\nSo 99(A -C)=495 \u2192 A -C =5. Which is correct.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nHmm. Since the problem's options don't have the correct answer, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares?\n\nWait, let me check the sum of squares for 863: 8\u00b2+6\u00b2+3\u00b2=64+36+9=109. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSum of digits:8+6+3=17. Correct.\n\nHmm. So the problem must have an error in the options, but since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the quadratic equation. Let me see:\n\nThe equation after substituting B was 6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0. Let me try solving this again.\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: C = [38 \u00b1 sqrt(38\u00b2 -4*6*60)]/(2*6).\n\nCompute discriminant: 1444 - 1440 =4 \u2192 sqrt(4)=2.\n\nThus, C=(38 \u00b12)/12 \u2192 (40)/12=10/3 or 36/12=3. So same as before.\n\nHmm. So I think I did everything right. But since the options don't have the correct answer, maybe I need to see if any of the options can fit with another interpretation?\n\nWait, maybe the problem says the reverse is the original minus 495. So if the original is 368, then 368 -495 is negative. Not possible. But if the original is 863, then subtract 495 gives 368 which is the reverse. So the correct number is 863, but it's not an option. The options include 368, which is the reverse. So maybe the question is phrased as the reverse number is obtained when subtracted, so the original is the reverse of the answer given. But the options don't have 863. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try the options again.\n\nWait option C is 288. Let me see:\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum is 18, not 17. So no.\n\nOption B)377:\n\nSum is 17, squares sum to 107. Close but not 109. \n\nWait, what if the correct answer is B)377? Let's see. 3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107. Not 109. So that's 2 less. Maybe a miscalculation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's sum of squares. Let me see:\n\nWait 3+7+7=17, but 3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2 is indeed 107. Not 109.\n\nHmm. The only number that fits all three conditions is 863. So perhaps the problem has a typo and the options are wrong. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)368\n\nB)377\n\nC)288\n\nD)997\n\nE)112\n\nHmm. Wait, option C is 288. Let me check again:\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum is 2+8+8=18. Not 17. So no.\n\nWait, what about 288? If the number is 288, subtract 495 gives negative. So no.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose the number is 368 (option A). The sum is 17, squares sum to 109. But when you subtract 495, you get a negative number, so it's invalid. But maybe the problem allows reversing the digits of the negative number? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is N = reverse -495? So N +495 = reverse. Then:\n\nFor N=368: 368+495=863, which is the reverse. So that would fit. But the problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\", which would mean N -495 = reverse. But if the question had said \"add 495 to the reverse to get the number\", then 368 would work. So perhaps there was a misinterpretation.\n\nWait the problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" So N -495 = reverse. So if N is 863, then yes, 863-495=368. So the number is 863. But it's not in the options. So unless the options are wrong, or I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in base 10 but the number is written in another way? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of squares is 109, but I made a mistake in calculation for another option.\n\nWait option C is 288. Let me check its squares:\n\n2\u00b2 +8\u00b2 +8\u00b2 =4+64+64=132. Not 109.\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's sum of squares? The problem says sum of squares is 109. Let me check for 863 again: 8\u00b2 is 64, 6\u00b2=36, 3\u00b2=9. Total 64+36=100, plus 9 is 109. Correct.\n\nHmm. So I think the correct answer is 863 which is not an option. But since the options must have the answer, perhaps there's an error in my process. Let me see if there's another possible solution.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming A = C+5. Let me check that again.\n\nEquation from N - R =495 \u2192 99(A - C) =495 \u2192 A-C=5. So that's correct.\n\nThus, A must be C+5. So the digits are constrained that way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the digits are allowed to be non-unique? Or perhaps leading zeros? But the number is three-digit, so A can't be zero. \n\nHmm. Since I can't find another solution and the given options don't include the correct answer, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution?\n\nWait, let me try plugging in option B:377 into the equations.\n\nLet me set A=3, B=7, C=7. Then:\n\nA + B + C = 3+7+7=17 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSum of squares: 9+49+49=107. Not 109. So close but no.\n\nIf we wanted the sum of squares to be 109 instead of 107, maybe there's a typo in the problem's sum of squares. If it were 107, then 377 would be the answer. But the problem states 109. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is A)368 even though it doesn't satisfy the third condition. But that would be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the equation setup. Let me try to see if there's another way.\n\nSuppose the number is 368. Then the reverse is 863. The difference between them is 863-368=495. So if the problem had said that the reverse minus the number equals 495, then 863-368=495. So in that case, the number would be 368. \n\nAh! Maybe I misread the problem's subtraction direction. Let me check again:\n\nThe problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\"\n\nSo, N -495 = reverse \u2192 N = reverse +495.\n\nSo if N is 368, then reverse +495 would be 863 +495? No, no. Wait, reverse of N is 863. So N -495 = reverse \u2192 368-495 = -127, which is not 863. So that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said subtract the number from 495, but that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem and the reverse is the original minus 495, so reverse = N -495. Which would mean that N = reverse +495. So the original number is the reverse plus 495. \n\nSo for example, if the original number is 863, then reverse is 368, and 368 +495 =863. So that works. So the original number is 863, which is not an option. So the problem's options must be wrong. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the closest is option A (368), even though it's the reverse. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me try plugging in C=4.\n\nIf C=4, then A=9 (since A=C+5). Then B=12-2*4=4. So digits are 9,4,4. Sum is 17. Sum of squares:81+16+16=113. Not 109.\n\nC=2: A=7, B=12-4=8. Number 782. Sum:7+8+2=17. Squares:49+64+4=117. Not 109.\n\nC=5: A=10, which is invalid (digit must be single-digit).\n\nC=1: A=6, B=12-2=10. B would be 10, which is invalid. So digits must be 0-9. So B=10 is impossible. So C can't be 1.\n\nC=6: A=11, invalid.\n\nC=0: A=5, B=12-0=12. Again B is 12, invalid.\n\nThus, only valid C is 3, leading to 863.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The options must have an error. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.\"\n\nWait, maybe the number after subtraction is the reverse, but not necessarily the same digits? But the problem says \"the same digits written in the reverse order.\" So the reverse must have the same digits. So the original number and its reverse must have the same digits, just reversed. So 863 and 368 have the same digits. So that's okay. \n\nThus, the correct answer should be 863, which is not listed. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the closest is option A (368), but it doesn't satisfy the subtraction part. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation for the reverse. Let me see:\n\nIf the number is ABC, then the reverse is CBA. So N - reverse =495 \u2192 100A+10B+C - (100C+10B+A)=99A -99C =99(A-C)=495 \u2192 A-C=5. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. I think the problem must have a typo in the options. But given the options provided, maybe the correct answer is A)368, but it's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the squares is 109 for another number. Let me check option B: 3,7,7. 3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107. Close, but not 109.\n\nOption C:2,8,8 \u2192 sum squares 4+64+64=132.\n\nOption D:9,9,7 \u2192 squares 81+81+49=211.\n\nOption E:1,1,2 \u2192 squares 1+1+4=6.\n\nSo only option A has the correct sum of squares. But the subtraction part doesn't work. So perhaps the question has a mistake, but given the options, the only one that satisfies the first two conditions is A)368. But the third condition is not met. So maybe the question intended the number to be the reverse, so the answer is A. But according to the problem's wording, the number is the one from which you subtract 495 to get the reverse, so the number is 863, which isn't there. \n\nHmm. I'm confused. Maybe I made a mistake in the beginning. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me list all three-digit numbers where the digits sum to 17 and the squares sum to 109. Then check which one minus 495 is its reverse.\n\nLet me think of digits A,B,C with A+C=12-B (from A+B+C=17 \u2192 B=17-A-C). \n\nAlso, A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2=109.\n\nLet me try possible values for C (since A = C+5).\n\nSince A = C+5, and A is a digit (1-9), C can be from 0 to4 (since C+5 <=9 \u2192 C<=4).\n\nWait, earlier I got C=3, but let's see:\n\nPossible C values:0,1,2,3,4.\n\nC=0 \u2192 A=5, B=12-0*2=12 \u2192 invalid (B must be 0-9).\n\nC=1 \u2192 A=6, B=12-2=10 \u2192 invalid.\n\nC=2 \u2192 A=7, B=12-4=8. So digits 7,8,2. Sum is 17. Squares:49+64+4=117. Not 109.\n\nC=3 \u2192 A=8, B=6. Digits 8,6,3. Squares 64+36+9=109. Correct.\n\nC=4 \u2192 A=9, B=12-8=4. Digits 9,4,4. Squares 81+16+16=113. Not 109.\n\nThus only C=3 gives valid digits with sum of squares 109. So the number is 863. Not in options. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed. But since the options are given, maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I need to choose the closest option that meets two conditions, which is A)368. But that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem had a different number. Wait, let me see if there's another way to get sum of digits 17 and squares 109 with another triplet.\n\nLet me think of other triplets where digits sum to17 and squares to109.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\nLooking for three digits (a,b,c) such that a+b+c=17, a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109.\n\nLet me think of possible digits:\n\nSuppose the digits are 9, something, something. Let's see:\n\nTake 9, 8,0: sum 17. Squares 81+64+0=145>109.\n\n9,7,1: sum 17. Squares 81+49+1=131.\n\n9,6,2 \u2192 sum 17. squares 81+36+4=121.\n\n9,5,3 \u2192 9+5+3=17. Squares 81+25+9=115.\n\n9,4,4 \u2192 sum 17. squares 81+16+16=113.\n\n8,7,2 \u2192 sum 17. squares 64+49+4=117.\n\n8,6,3 \u2192 64+36+9=109. That's the one we found.\n\n8,5,4 \u2192 64+25+16=105.\n\n7,7,3 \u2192 49+49+9=107.\n\n7,6,4 \u2192 49+36+16=101.\n\n6,6,5 \u2192 36+36+25=97.\n\nHmm. So the only triplet is 8,6,3. Thus the number is 863, which isn't an option. \n\nSo, I think the problem's options are incorrect. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the squares of its digits is 109\". The number 368 has digits 3,6,8, which squared sum to 109. The reverse of 368 is 863. The difference between 863 and 368 is 495. So perhaps the question intended to say that the number minus its reverse is 495, so the number is larger by 495. So the number would be 863, but since it's not an option, maybe the question meant that the reverse minus the number is 495. Which would mean the number is smaller. Then the reverse would be the number plus 495. For example, if the number is 368, then 368+495=863. So the reverse is the number plus 495. In that case, the problem's wording would have been \"If we add 495 to the number, we get the reverse\". Then the answer would be 368. So maybe there was a misstatement in the problem's subtraction. If that's the case, then option A is correct.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem had a typo and the correct answer is A)368. Since I have to choose from the options, I'll go with A, assuming that the problem's subtraction was supposed to be addition. But according to the original problem's wording, it should be subtraction. But since there's no other option, I'll choose A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this three-digit number problem. Let me see. The question says the sum of the digits is 17, the sum of their squares is 109, and when you subtract 495 from the number, you get its reverse. Hmm, okay. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the three-digit number as ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B the tens, and C the units. So the actual number is 100A + 10B + C. The reverse would be 100C + 10B + A. The problem says that when you subtract 495 from the original number, you get the reversed number. So:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A.\n\nHmm, let's rearrange that equation. Subtract the right side from both sides:\n\n100A +10B + C - 495 - (100C +10B +A) =0\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(100A - A) + (10B -10B) + (C -100C) -495 =0\n\nSo that's 99A - 99C -495 =0\n\nDivide all terms by 99:\n\nA - C -5 =0 \u2192 A - C =5.\n\nSo that's one equation: A = C +5. Got that.\n\nNext, the sum of the digits is 17: A + B + C =17.\n\nSum of squares is 109: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nSo now, we have three equations:\n\n1. A = C +5\n2. A + B + C =17\n3. A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109\n\nLet me substitute equation 1 into the others. Let's start with equation 2.\n\nSubstituting A = C+5 into equation 2:\n\n(C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C +5 + B =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B =12-2C.\n\nNow, equation 3: substitute A and B in terms of C.\n\nA is C+5, B is 12-2C. So:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25\n\nSecond term: (12-2C)^2 = ( -2C +12)^2 = (2C-12)^2 \u2192 4C\u00b2 -48C +144\n\nThird term: C\u00b2.\n\nAdding all three terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 +4C\u00b2 -48C +144 +C\u00b2 \n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2\n\n10C -48C =-38C\n\n25 +144 =169\n\nSo total: 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 = 109\n\nSubtract 109 from both sides: 6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Maybe divide all terms by 2?\n\n3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0\n\nHmm, quadratic equation. Let's see if it factors.\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 3*30=90 and add to -19. Wait, maybe:\n\nWait, 3C\u00b2 -19C +30. Let me try factoring:\n\nLooking for factors of 3*30=90 that add to -19. Hmm. Since the middle term is -19 and the constant term is +30, the factors should both be negative.\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a*b = 90 and a +b =19. Let's see:\n\n9 and 10: 9+10=19. So yes. So split the middle term:\n\n3C\u00b2 -9C -10C +30=0\n\nGroup:\n\n(3C\u00b2 -9C) + (-10C +30) =0\n\n3C(C-3) -10(C-3)=0\n\nTake (C-3) common:\n\n(3C -10)(C -3) =0 \u2192 So solutions are C=10/3 or C=3.\n\nBut C is a digit (0-9), so 10/3 is not possible. So C=3.\n\nSo C is 3. Then from equation 1, A =3+5=8.\n\nThen B =12 -2C =12 -6=6.\n\nSo the digits would be A=8, B=6, C=3. So the number is 863? Wait, but looking at the options given:\n\nOptions are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. None of these is 863. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let's check the calculations again. Let me retrace.\n\nStarting from the quadratic equation:\n\nAfter substituting, the equation was 6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0. Divided by 2 gives 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0. Let me check the discriminant here.\n\nDiscriminant D= 19\u00b2 -4*3*30 = 361 - 360 =1. Wait, 361-360=1. So sqrt(1)=1. So solutions are [19 \u00b11]/6. \n\nWait, so (19+1)/6 =20/6=10/3, which is ~3.333, not integer. (19-1)/6=18/6=3. So that's correct. So C=3 is the only valid solution. Then A=8, B=6. So the number would be 863. But this isn't among the options. Hmm. So that suggests that either I made a mistake in the equations, or perhaps an error in substitution.\n\nWait let me check the equations again.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nThe first equation from subtracting 495 gives A - C =5. So that part is correct.\n\nSecond equation: A + B + C=17. Substituting A = C+5 gives (C+5) + B + C = 17 \u2192 2C + B +5 =17 \u2192 2C + B=12. That's correct.\n\nThird equation, sum of squares: (C+5)^2 + B^2 + C\u00b2 =109. And B is 12-2C.\n\nSo substituting B=12-2C into that:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 = ?\n\nLet me recalculate the expansion step again. Maybe I messed up here.\n\nFirst term (C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25.\n\nSecond term (12-2C)^2 = (12)^2 - 2*12*2C + (2C)^2 \u2192 144 -48C +4C\u00b2. Yes, that's correct.\n\nThird term C\u00b2.\n\nAdding all three terms:\n\nC\u00b2+10C+25 +4C\u00b2 -48C +144 +C\u00b2 \u2192 \n\nTotal C\u00b2 terms: 1+4+1=6C\u00b2.\n\nC terms: 10C-48C= -38C.\n\nConstants:25+144=169.\n\nThus, 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109 \u2192 6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0 \u2192 dividing by 2: 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0. That's correct.\n\nHmm, so the solution is C=3, so the number is 8 6 3. But that's not an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation?\n\nWait, the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. Let me check with 863.\n\n863 - 495 = 368. The reverse of 863 is 368. So that's correct. Wait, 368 is option A. Wait, so the number is 863, but the reverse is 368 which is option A. But the question asks for the original number. So the options include 368 as option A, but the original number would be 863 which isn't listed. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait maybe I messed up the equation?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" So if the original number is ABC, the reverse is CBA. Wait, the equation I set up was:\n\nOriginal number minus 495 equals reversed number. So:\n\nABC (number) -495 = CBA (reverse). So 100A+10B+C -495 = 100C +10B +A.\n\nWait, when I subtract, let me check with 863:\n\n863 -495 = 368. And the reverse of 863 is 368. So that's exactly correct. So the original number is 863, but it's not among the options. The options given are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112.\n\nHmm, that suggests that maybe I made an error in the equations. Alternatively, perhaps there's another solution?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in solving the quadratic. Let me check again.\n\nThe quadratic was 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0. Let me compute the roots again.\n\nThe quadratic formula: C = [19 \u00b1 sqrt(361 - 360)]/(2*3) \u2192 sqrt(1)=1 \u2192 (19 \u00b11)/6.\n\nSo (19+1)/6 =20/6 \u22483.333, which is not an integer. (19-1)/6=18/6=3. So yes, only C=3 is valid. So the number must be 863, but that's not an option. The options given don't have that. So perhaps there's an error in my approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the equation. Let me check the equation again.\n\nThe problem says: subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So:\n\nNumber - 495 = reverse.\n\nSo, Number = reverse +495. Let's see for the options given, maybe one of them satisfies this.\n\nLet me check the options one by one.\n\nOption A is 368. Let's see: reverse is 863. 863 - 495 = 368. So 368 is the number? Wait, no. The original number would be 863, but the option is 368. So if the question is asking for the original number, then the answer isn't listed. But that can't be. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, maybe I flipped the equation. The problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So the equation is Number -495 = reverse. So the original number is bigger than the reverse by 495. Let me check the options:\n\nCheck option A)368. Its reverse is 863. 368 -495 would be negative. Not possible. So the original number must be larger than 495. So the number must be over 495. So possible options are B)377 (377-495 negative), C)288 (too small), D)997, E)112 (too small). So only D)997 is over 495.\n\nWait D is 997. Let me check if that works.\n\nOriginal number 997. Reverse is 799. 997 -495 =502. Which is not 799. So that's not right.\n\nWait option B is 377. Reverse is 773. 377-495 is negative, so no.\n\nOption C is 288. Reverse is 882. 288-495 is negative.\n\nHmm. So none of the options except D and maybe others? Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check the other options.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's equations. Let me try another approach. Let's check each option and see which one satisfies all conditions.\n\nOption A)368:\n\nDigits: 3,6,8.\n\nSum:3+6+8=17. That's good.\n\nSum of squares: 9+36+64= 109. That's correct.\n\nThen, subtract 495 from 368: 368-495= -127. Which is not the reverse (which would be 863). So that doesn't work. But the reverse is 863, so the original number must be 863, which is not an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So if the original number is 863, subtract 495 gives 368, which is the reverse. So 863 is the correct number, but it's not listed. So that's a problem. The options don't have it. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the equations. Let me check another option.\n\nOption C)288:\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum is 2+8+8=18, which is not 17. So no.\n\nOption B)377:\n\nDigits 3+7+7=17. Sum is okay. Sum of squares:9+49+49=107. Not 109. Close but not right.\n\nOption D)997: digits 9+9+7=25. Not 17. So no.\n\nOption E)112: sum is 4. Nope.\n\nHmm. So the only candidate is option A (368) but it doesn't satisfy the subtraction part. Wait, but the problem says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. For option A, 368 -495 is negative, so that can't be. So maybe the correct answer is not listed? But that can't be. The problem must have an answer among the options. Did I make a mistake in the equations?\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem. Let me check the equations again. Maybe I made a mistake in the first equation.\n\nOriginal equation: the number minus 495 equals the reverse. So:\n\nOriginal number N = 100A +10B +C\n\nReverse R = 100C +10B +A\n\nSo N -495 = R \u2192 100A+10B+C -495 = 100C+10B+A \u2192 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A - C =5. That's correct. So A = C+5.\n\nSo the first equation is okay.\n\nSecond equation, sum A+B+C=17.\n\nThird equation, sum squares =109.\n\nSo with A=8, B=6, C=3, sum is 17, squares sum to 109. So that's correct. So the number is 863, which isn't listed. But the options include 368 (the reverse). Maybe the problem was stated incorrectly? Or perhaps I have a miscalculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the problem's condition. Let me read again.\n\n\"the sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.\"\n\nSo the problem requires the original number to satisfy all three conditions. The number 863 does that, but it's not an option. So maybe there's another solution?\n\nWait, the quadratic equation only had one valid digit solution (C=3). But maybe there's another way? Let me see.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the quadratic equation step.\n\nWait, let's recalculate the sum of squares step again, but using the variables:\n\nA = C+5, B =12-2C.\n\nSo A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2.\n\nLet me compute each term again:\n\n(C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25.\n\n(12-2C)^2 = (2C-12)^2 =4C\u00b2 -48C +144.\n\nC\u00b2.\n\nAdding them all:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 +4C\u00b2 -48C +144 + C\u00b2 = (1+4+1)C\u00b2 + (10C-48C) + (25+144).\n\nSo 6C\u00b2 -38C +169. Set equal to 109 \u2192 6C\u00b2-38C+60=0 \u2192 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the quadratic is right. Hmm. So the only solution is C=3, leading to 863.\n\nSince the options don't include it, maybe the problem had a typo, or perhaps I misread the options?\n\nLooking back at the options again:\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)368\n\nB)377\n\nC)288\n\nD)997\n\nE)112\n\nHmm, 368 is the reverse of 863, which is the correct number. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the reversed number? But that wouldn't make sense because subtracting 495 from the original gives the reversed. So original is 863, reversed is 368. The question asks for the original number. Since it's not listed, perhaps the options are wrong. But that's unlikely. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, let me check another possibility. Suppose the equation was N - reverse = 495, but the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So N -495 = reverse \u2192 N - reverse =495. So the difference between the original and reverse is 495. Let me see what's the difference between 863 and 368: 863-368=495. Yes, that's correct. So that's correct. So the number is indeed 863, but the options don't have it. So perhaps there's another approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sum of squares? Let me check for option C)288:\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum is 18. Not 17.\n\nOption B:3+7+7=17. Sum squares: 9+49+49=107. Not 109. Close.\n\nOption A:3\u00b2+6\u00b2+8\u00b2=9+36+64=109. Wait a second! Wait, the sum of squares for 368 is exactly 109. The digits of 368 add to 17. Wait, but the number 368's digits are 3+6+8=17. Sum of squares is 109. So that's correct. But then why does the equation give 863?\n\nWait, hold on! Oh no! Maybe I got the direction wrong. Let me re-express:\n\nIf the original number is 368, then subtracting 495 would give a negative number, which isn't the reverse. But the problem states that subtracting 495 gives the reversed number. So 368-495 = -127, which is not the reverse. So that's invalid.\n\nBut 863-495=368, which is the reverse. So 863 is the correct original number. So why is option A 368?\n\nHmm. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the equations?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the interpretation of the reverse. Let me check if the reverse of 368 is 863, which it is. So the correct number is 863, but since it's not an option, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Alternatively, maybe the problem says \"the reverse is obtained when you subtract 495\" but maybe the reverse is the original number minus 495? So if the original number is 368, then 368-495 would be negative. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the equations. Let me check another option. Let's try option C)288. Let's see:\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum is 18, which is over 17. So no.\n\nOption B)377: sum is 17. Sum squares:3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2= 9+49+49=107. Not 109. So close but not.\n\nWait, maybe the correct answer is option B)377 but the problem had a typo in the sum of squares?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me try plugging in the options.\n\nOption A)368:\n\nCheck the three conditions:\n\n1. Sum digits:3+6+8=17 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Sum squares:9+36+64=109 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n3. Subtract 495: 368-495 = -127. Not reverse (863). So \u274c.\n\nSo condition 3 fails.\n\nOption B)377:\n\n1. Sum:3+7+7=17 \u2714\ufe0f\n\n2. Sum squares:9+49+49=107 \u274c (needs 109)\n\n3. Reverse is 773. 377-495= -118 \u274c.\n\nNo.\n\nOption C)288:\n\nSum:2+8+8=18 \u274c.\n\nOption D)997:\n\nSum:9+9+7=25 \u274c.\n\nE)112: Sum is 4 \u274c.\n\nSo none of the options except A and B meet two of the three conditions, but only A meets first two. But the third condition is crucial. So the only number that meets all three conditions is 863, which isn't listed. \n\nHmm. Did I make a mistake in the equations?\n\nWait, let me think again. Let's suppose that the number is 368 (option A). Then the reverse is 863, and 368 + 495 = 863. Oh! Wait, maybe I reversed the equation. The problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So N -495 = reverse \u2192 N = reverse +495. So if N is 863, then reverse is 368, and 368 +495 =863. So that's correct. But the question asks for the number N, which is 863, but that's not an option. The options include 368, which is the reverse. So unless the problem is worded differently, like adding instead of subtracting?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says subtract the reverse from the number to get 495? Let me see:\n\nN - reverse =495. Which would give the same as before. So the equations are correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another solution where C is not an integer? But digits must be integers between 0-9.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation had another solution C=10/3 \u22483.333. Which is not an integer, so invalid. So no.\n\nHmm. Since none of the options work except for 863 which isn't listed, but the options given must have an answer, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first equation. Let me re-derive it again.\n\nOriginal number N = 100A +10B +C.\n\nReverse R = 100C +10B +A.\n\nThe problem says N -495 = R \u2192 N - R =495.\n\nSo N - R = (100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) = 99A -99C =99(A -C).\n\nSo 99(A -C)=495 \u2192 A -C =5. Which is correct.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nHmm. Since the problem's options don't have the correct answer, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares?\n\nWait, let me check the sum of squares for 863: 8\u00b2+6\u00b2+3\u00b2=64+36+9=109. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSum of digits:8+6+3=17. Correct.\n\nHmm. So the problem must have an error in the options, but since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the quadratic equation. Let me see:\n\nThe equation after substituting B was 6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0. Let me try solving this again.\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: C = [38 \u00b1 sqrt(38\u00b2 -4*6*60)]/(2*6).\n\nCompute discriminant: 1444 - 1440 =4 \u2192 sqrt(4)=2.\n\nThus, C=(38 \u00b12)/12 \u2192 (40)/12=10/3 or 36/12=3. So same as before.\n\nHmm. So I think I did everything right. But since the options don't have the correct answer, maybe I need to see if any of the options can fit with another interpretation?\n\nWait, maybe the problem says the reverse is the original minus 495. So if the original is 368, then 368 -495 is negative. Not possible. But if the original is 863, then subtract 495 gives 368 which is the reverse. So the correct number is 863, but it's not an option. The options include 368, which is the reverse. So maybe the question is phrased as the reverse number is obtained when subtracted, so the original is the reverse of the answer given. But the options don't have 863. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me try the options again.\n\nWait option C is 288. Let me see:\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum is 18, not 17. So no.\n\nOption B)377:\n\nSum is 17, squares sum to 107. Close but not 109. \n\nWait, what if the correct answer is B)377? Let's see. 3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107. Not 109. So that's 2 less. Maybe a miscalculation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's sum of squares. Let me see:\n\nWait 3+7+7=17, but 3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2 is indeed 107. Not 109.\n\nHmm. The only number that fits all three conditions is 863. So perhaps the problem has a typo and the options are wrong. Alternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)368\n\nB)377\n\nC)288\n\nD)997\n\nE)112\n\nHmm. Wait, option C is 288. Let me check again:\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum is 2+8+8=18. Not 17. So no.\n\nWait, what about 288? If the number is 288, subtract 495 gives negative. So no.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me try another approach.\n\nSuppose the number is 368 (option A). The sum is 17, squares sum to 109. But when you subtract 495, you get a negative number, so it's invalid. But maybe the problem allows reversing the digits of the negative number? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is N = reverse -495? So N +495 = reverse. Then:\n\nFor N=368: 368+495=863, which is the reverse. So that would fit. But the problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\", which would mean N -495 = reverse. But if the question had said \"add 495 to the reverse to get the number\", then 368 would work. So perhaps there was a misinterpretation.\n\nWait the problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" So N -495 = reverse. So if N is 863, then yes, 863-495=368. So the number is 863. But it's not in the options. So unless the options are wrong, or I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in base 10 but the number is written in another way? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum of squares is 109, but I made a mistake in calculation for another option.\n\nWait option C is 288. Let me check its squares:\n\n2\u00b2 +8\u00b2 +8\u00b2 =4+64+64=132. Not 109.\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's sum of squares? The problem says sum of squares is 109. Let me check for 863 again: 8\u00b2 is 64, 6\u00b2=36, 3\u00b2=9. Total 64+36=100, plus 9 is 109. Correct.\n\nHmm. So I think the correct answer is 863 which is not an option. But since the options must have the answer, perhaps there's an error in my process. Let me see if there's another possible solution.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming A = C+5. Let me check that again.\n\nEquation from N - R =495 \u2192 99(A - C) =495 \u2192 A-C=5. So that's correct.\n\nThus, A must be C+5. So the digits are constrained that way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the digits are allowed to be non-unique? Or perhaps leading zeros? But the number is three-digit, so A can't be zero. \n\nHmm. Since I can't find another solution and the given options don't include the correct answer, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution?\n\nWait, let me try plugging in option B:377 into the equations.\n\nLet me set A=3, B=7, C=7. Then:\n\nA + B + C = 3+7+7=17 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSum of squares: 9+49+49=107. Not 109. So close but no.\n\nIf we wanted the sum of squares to be 109 instead of 107, maybe there's a typo in the problem's sum of squares. If it were 107, then 377 would be the answer. But the problem states 109. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is A)368 even though it doesn't satisfy the third condition. But that would be incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the equation setup. Let me try to see if there's another way.\n\nSuppose the number is 368. Then the reverse is 863. The difference between them is 863-368=495. So if the problem had said that the reverse minus the number equals 495, then 863-368=495. So in that case, the number would be 368. \n\nAh! Maybe I misread the problem's subtraction direction. Let me check again:\n\nThe problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\"\n\nSo, N -495 = reverse \u2192 N = reverse +495.\n\nSo if N is 368, then reverse +495 would be 863 +495? No, no. Wait, reverse of N is 863. So N -495 = reverse \u2192 368-495 = -127, which is not 863. So that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem had said subtract the number from 495, but that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem and the reverse is the original minus 495, so reverse = N -495. Which would mean that N = reverse +495. So the original number is the reverse plus 495. \n\nSo for example, if the original number is 863, then reverse is 368, and 368 +495 =863. So that works. So the original number is 863, which is not an option. So the problem's options must be wrong. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the closest is option A (368), even though it's the reverse. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me try plugging in C=4.\n\nIf C=4, then A=9 (since A=C+5). Then B=12-2*4=4. So digits are 9,4,4. Sum is 17. Sum of squares:81+16+16=113. Not 109.\n\nC=2: A=7, B=12-4=8. Number 782. Sum:7+8+2=17. Squares:49+64+4=117. Not 109.\n\nC=5: A=10, which is invalid (digit must be single-digit).\n\nC=1: A=6, B=12-2=10. B would be 10, which is invalid. So digits must be 0-9. So B=10 is impossible. So C can't be 1.\n\nC=6: A=11, invalid.\n\nC=0: A=5, B=12-0=12. Again B is 12, invalid.\n\nThus, only valid C is 3, leading to 863.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The options must have an error. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.\"\n\nWait, maybe the number after subtraction is the reverse, but not necessarily the same digits? But the problem says \"the same digits written in the reverse order.\" So the reverse must have the same digits. So the original number and its reverse must have the same digits, just reversed. So 863 and 368 have the same digits. So that's okay. \n\nThus, the correct answer should be 863, which is not listed. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the closest is option A (368), but it doesn't satisfy the subtraction part. Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation for the reverse. Let me see:\n\nIf the number is ABC, then the reverse is CBA. So N - reverse =495 \u2192 100A+10B+C - (100C+10B+A)=99A -99C =99(A-C)=495 \u2192 A-C=5. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. I think the problem must have a typo in the options. But given the options provided, maybe the correct answer is A)368, but it's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the squares is 109 for another number. Let me check option B: 3,7,7. 3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107. Close, but not 109.\n\nOption C:2,8,8 \u2192 sum squares 4+64+64=132.\n\nOption D:9,9,7 \u2192 squares 81+81+49=211.\n\nOption E:1,1,2 \u2192 squares 1+1+4=6.\n\nSo only option A has the correct sum of squares. But the subtraction part doesn't work. So perhaps the question has a mistake, but given the options, the only one that satisfies the first two conditions is A)368. But the third condition is not met. So maybe the question intended the number to be the reverse, so the answer is A. But according to the problem's wording, the number is the one from which you subtract 495 to get the reverse, so the number is 863, which isn't there. \n\nHmm. I'm confused. Maybe I made a mistake in the beginning. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me list all three-digit numbers where the digits sum to 17 and the squares sum to 109. Then check which one minus 495 is its reverse.\n\nLet me think of digits A,B,C with A+C=12-B (from A+B+C=17 \u2192 B=17-A-C). \n\nAlso, A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2=109.\n\nLet me try possible values for C (since A = C+5).\n\nSince A = C+5, and A is a digit (1-9), C can be from 0 to4 (since C+5 <=9 \u2192 C<=4).\n\nWait, earlier I got C=3, but let's see:\n\nPossible C values:0,1,2,3,4.\n\nC=0 \u2192 A=5, B=12-0*2=12 \u2192 invalid (B must be 0-9).\n\nC=1 \u2192 A=6, B=12-2=10 \u2192 invalid.\n\nC=2 \u2192 A=7, B=12-4=8. So digits 7,8,2. Sum is 17. Squares:49+64+4=117. Not 109.\n\nC=3 \u2192 A=8, B=6. Digits 8,6,3. Squares 64+36+9=109. Correct.\n\nC=4 \u2192 A=9, B=12-8=4. Digits 9,4,4. Squares 81+16+16=113. Not 109.\n\nThus only C=3 gives valid digits with sum of squares 109. So the number is 863. Not in options. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is not listed. But since the options are given, maybe there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I need to choose the closest option that meets two conditions, which is A)368. But that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem had a different number. Wait, let me see if there's another way to get sum of digits 17 and squares 109 with another triplet.\n\nLet me think of other triplets where digits sum to17 and squares to109.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\nLooking for three digits (a,b,c) such that a+b+c=17, a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109.\n\nLet me think of possible digits:\n\nSuppose the digits are 9, something, something. Let's see:\n\nTake 9, 8,0: sum 17. Squares 81+64+0=145>109.\n\n9,7,1: sum 17. Squares 81+49+1=131.\n\n9,6,2 \u2192 sum 17. squares 81+36+4=121.\n\n9,5,3 \u2192 9+5+3=17. Squares 81+25+9=115.\n\n9,4,4 \u2192 sum 17. squares 81+16+16=113.\n\n8,7,2 \u2192 sum 17. squares 64+49+4=117.\n\n8,6,3 \u2192 64+36+9=109. That's the one we found.\n\n8,5,4 \u2192 64+25+16=105.\n\n7,7,3 \u2192 49+49+9=107.\n\n7,6,4 \u2192 49+36+16=101.\n\n6,6,5 \u2192 36+36+25=97.\n\nHmm. So the only triplet is 8,6,3. Thus the number is 863, which isn't an option. \n\nSo, I think the problem's options are incorrect. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the squares of its digits is 109\". The number 368 has digits 3,6,8, which squared sum to 109. The reverse of 368 is 863. The difference between 863 and 368 is 495. So perhaps the question intended to say that the number minus its reverse is 495, so the number is larger by 495. So the number would be 863, but since it's not an option, maybe the question meant that the reverse minus the number is 495. Which would mean the number is smaller. Then the reverse would be the number plus 495. For example, if the number is 368, then 368+495=863. So the reverse is the number plus 495. In that case, the problem's wording would have been \"If we add 495 to the number, we get the reverse\". Then the answer would be 368. So maybe there was a misstatement in the problem's subtraction. If that's the case, then option A is correct.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem had a typo and the correct answer is A)368. Since I have to choose from the options, I'll go with A, assuming that the problem's subtraction was supposed to be addition. But according to the original problem's wording, it should be subtraction. But since there's no other option, I'll choose A.\n\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find a three-digit number where the sum of its digits is 17, the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, and when I subtract 495 from it, the result is the reverse of the original number. The options are given, so maybe I can check each one, but maybe solving it step by step would be better.\n\nLet me denote the three-digit number as ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B the tens, and C the units. So the number itself is 100A + 10B + C. The reverse would be 100C + 10B + A. The problem says that when we subtract 495 from the original number, we get the reversed number. So the equation would be:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\n\nHmm, let's rearrange that equation. Subtract the right side from both sides, but maybe better to bring similar terms together.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nOriginal number - 495 = reversed number.\n\nSo, 100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B +A\n\nSubtract 10B from both sides, which cancels them out. Then:\n\n100A + C -495 = 100C + A\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n100A + C -495 -100C -A =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(100A - A) + (C -100C) -495 =0 \u2192 99A -99C -495 =0\n\nHmm, factor out 99? Let's see:\n\n99(A - C) = 495 \u2192 A - C = 495 /99 = 5. So A - C =5. \n\nSo that's one equation: A = C +5.\n\nAnother condition is that the sum of the digits is 17: A + B + C =17.\n\nThird condition is the sum of the squares of the digits is 109: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. A = C +5\n\n2. A + B + C =17 \u2192 substituting A gives (C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B +5 =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B =12-2C\n\n3. A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109. Substitute A and B from above.\n\nLet me write equation 3:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nFirst term: (C\u00b2 +10C +25)\n\nSecond term: (12-2C)^2 \u2192 144 -48C +4C\u00b2\n\nThird term: C\u00b2.\n\nAdding all together:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 +144 -48C +4C\u00b2 + C\u00b2 \n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2\n\n10C -48C = -38C\n\n25+144=169\n\nSo total equation: 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109.\n\nSubtract 109:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0\n\nHmm, divide all terms by 2? Let's see: 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0.\n\nNow, solve quadratic equation 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0.\n\nUse quadratic formula: C = [19 \u00b1 sqrt(361 - 360)] /6.\n\nWait, discriminant D = (19)^2 -4*3*30 = 361 - 360 =1.\n\nSo sqrt(1) is 1. Therefore,\n\nC = [19 \u00b11]/6 \u2192 two possibilities:\n\nC=(19+1)/6=20/6\u22483.333... Not integer. Since C is a digit (0-9), must be integer.\n\nOr C=(19-1)/6=18/6=3. So C=3.\n\nSo C=3. Then A = C +5 =8.\n\nThen B =12-2C \u2192 12-6=6.\n\nSo the digits are A=8, B=6, C=3. So the number is 863? Wait, but looking at the options, none of them is 863. The options are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. Hmm, so that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check my equations again.\n\nLet me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nFirst, the subtraction equation leading to A - C =5. That seems right.\n\nSum of digits: A + B + C =17 \u2192 substituting A = C+5 gives (C+5) + B +C =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B=12-2C. That's correct.\n\nSum of squares equation: (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the expansion again:\n\nFirst term: (C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25\n\nSecond term: (12-2C)^2 = (12)^2 - 2*12*2C + (2C)^2 \u2192 144 -48C +4C\u00b2. Wait, no, wait: (a - b)^2 is a\u00b2-2ab +b\u00b2. So 12 squared is 144, minus 2*(12)*(2C)=48C, plus (2C)^2=4C\u00b2. So that term is correct.\n\nThird term is C\u00b2. So adding all three:\n\nFirst term: C\u00b2 +10C +25\n\nSecond: 4C\u00b2 -48C +144\n\nThird: C\u00b2\n\nTotal:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2\n\n10C -48C = -38C\n\n25+144=169\n\nSo equation is 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109 \u2192 6C\u00b2-38C +60=0 \u2192 dividing by 2 gives 3C\u00b2-19C +30=0 \u2192 correct.\n\nSolutions: [19 \u00b1\u221a(361-360)]/6 \u2192 sqrt(1) so 20/6 and 18/6. 18/6 is 3. So C=3.\n\nThus, digits would be A=8, B=6, C=3. So the number is 863. But this isn't an option. Hmm. That's an issue. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup?\n\nWait, let me check the reverse part again. The original number minus 495 equals the reversed digits. Let me see if 863 -495 equals 368. Let's compute 863-495: 863-400=463, 463-95=368. Yes, so 368 is the reverse. But the options include 368 as option A. Wait, so the original number would be 863? But that's not among the options either. Wait, the options are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112.\n\nHmm. So the problem says \"the number\" which when subtracted by 495 gives the reversed number. Wait, maybe I reversed the order? Let me check the equation again.\n\nWait, the equation was: Original number -495 = reversed number. So if original is 863, then 863-495=368, which is the reverse (368 is the reverse of 863? Wait, 863 reversed is 368, yes. So the original number would be 863, but that's not an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the equations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in solving the quadratic. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the sum of squares of digits: If the number was 863, the sum of squares would be 8\u00b2+6\u00b2+3\u00b2=64+36+9=109. Which matches the third condition. The sum of digits is 8+6+3=17. So that's correct. So the number is 863, but it's not in the options. That's a problem.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I messed up the equations?\n\nWait, looking at the options again, option A is 368. Let me check that. Let's see if 368 is the original number. Then subtracting 495 would give a negative number? Wait, 368-495 is -127. But the reversed number of 368 is 863. But that's not equal. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe the problem states that subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. So if the correct number is 863, which gives 368 when subtracted by 495, then 368 is the reverse. But the options don't include 863, so that suggests I must have made an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me re-examine the equations again.\n\nOriginal equation: N - 495 = reverse(N). Let me write N as 100A +10B + C, reverse is 100C +10B + A.\n\nSo equation: 100A +10B +C -495 = 100C +10B + A \u2192 moving terms:\n\n100A - A -495 = 100C - C \u2192 99A -99C =495 \u2192 99(A - C)=495 \u2192 A-C =5. That's correct.\n\nSo A is C+5. Then sum A+B+C=17 \u2192 (C+5) + B +C =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B=12-2C. So that's correct.\n\nThen sum of squares: (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nWait, let me calculate that for C=3:\n\n(3+5)^2 + (12-6)^2 + 9 \u2192 8\u00b2 +6\u00b2 +3\u00b2 \u2192 64+36+9=109. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. So the problem is that the correct answer isn't listed. Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nA)368 \u2192 which is the reversed number. But the question asks for the original number. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options? But that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation?\n\nWait, maybe I swapped the subtraction direction? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\"\n\nYes, so N -495 = reversed N. So original is N, subtract 495 to get reversed N. So the original N must be larger than 495, since reversed N would be a three-digit number (since original is three-digit, reversed is also three-digit). So 863 is a valid three-digit number, but not in options. Wait, looking at the options, the closest is option C)288. Let's see what happens if I try option C: 288.\n\nLet's check 288: sum of digits is 2+8+8=18. Not 17. So that can't be.\n\nOption D:997. Sum is 9+9+7=25. Not 17.\n\nOption B:377. Sum 3+7+7=17. Okay. Let's check its squares: 9 +49 +49= 107. Not 109. So no.\n\nOption A:368. Sum is 3+6+8=17. Sum of squares: 9+36+64= 109. Oh! Wait a second. Wait, 368's digits sum to 17, and squares sum to 109. But according to the problem, the original number minus 495 should be the reverse. Let's see what happens if the original number is 368. 368-495 is negative, so that can't be. But maybe the reverse is 863, but 368-495 is negative. So that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me see option B: 377. Let's check the conditions.\n\nSum digits: 3+7+7=17. Good. Sum squares: 9 +49 +49=107. Not 109. So that's close but not correct.\n\nOption C:288 \u2192 sum digits 2+8+8=18. No.\n\nOption E:112 \u2192 sum is 4. No.\n\nHmm. The only one that matches the sum of squares and digits is option A:368, but the subtraction gives a negative number, so that can't be the original number. Unless I messed up the equation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says subtract the number from 495? That would reverse the equation, but the wording is \"subtract 495 from the number\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reversed number is not the reverse of the original, but the reverse of the digits? Wait, the problem says \"the same digits written in the reverse order\". So reverse of the original number. So 368 reversed is 863, so original N must be 863, which is not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the quadratic solution?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the quadratic equation:\n\nThe equation after substituting was:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0 \u2192 divide by 2 \u2192 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0.\n\nLet me compute discriminant again: (19)^2 -4*3*30 = 361 - 360 =1. Correct. So roots are (19\u00b11)/6 \u2192 20/6 and 18/6. 18/6 is 3, so C=3. So that's correct. Then A=8, B=6, C=3. So the number is 863. But it's not in the options. That's a problem. So perhaps the options are wrong? Or maybe I have a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is reversed? Let me think again. The problem states that subtracting 495 from the number gives the reversed number. So N -495 = reversed N.\n\nBut perhaps the reversed number is written with the same digits in reverse order, but the problem didn't specify that the reversed number is a three-digit number? Wait, but the original is three digits, so reversed would also be three digits. Unless leading zero is allowed, but then the reversed number would be two digits. But that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the equation setup. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal number: 100A +10B + C\n\nReversed number: 100C +10B + A\n\nEquation: (100A +10B +C) -495 = 100C +10B +A \u2192 \n\nYes, so rearranged:\n\n100A +10B +C -495 -100C -10B -A =0 \u2192 99A -99C -495=0 \u2192 99(A - C) =495 \u2192 A-C=5. Correct.\n\nHmm. So the problem must have an error, but since the options are given, maybe I need to check them again. Let me check each option to see which one fits all three conditions.\n\nLet's check option A:368.\n\nDigits: 3,6,8. Sum:3+6+8=17. Good. Sum of squares: 9+36+64= 109. That's correct. Then subtract 495 from 368: 368-495= -127. But the reverse of 368 is 863, so that's not equal. So this can't be the answer.\n\nOption B:377. Sum 3+7+7=17. Squares:9+49+49=107. Not 109. So no.\n\nOption C:288. Sum 2+8+8=18. Not 17.\n\nOption D:997. Sum 25. No.\n\nOption E:112. Sum 4. No.\n\nHmm. So the only one that meets the first two conditions (sum and squares) is option A. But the third condition fails. So that's confusing. Unless I made a mistake in the third condition.\n\nWait, let's see the third condition for option A: 368 -495 is -127. The reverse of 368 is 863, which is not equal to -127. So that's not valid.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem requires the reverse number to be N minus 495, but perhaps I got the direction wrong? Like, maybe the reverse is N -495, but the reverse is a three-digit number, so N must be bigger than 495. So the original number must be larger than 495. The options that are over 495 are options B (377?), no. Wait, 377 is 377, which is less than 495. 288 is less. 997 is over. 368 is 368. So only 997 and 288? Wait 288 is 288, less than 495. 997 is way over.\n\nLet me check option D:997. Subtract 495 gives 502. Reverse of 997 is 799. 502 is not 799. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me think again. Let me try to check if there's another solution for the quadratic equation.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation had only one valid solution (C=3). Because the other solution was C=20/6 which is ~3.333, which is not an integer. So there's only one solution here. But that gives 863 which isn't in options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there was an error in the problem's options? Or perhaps I misapplied the equation.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe when subtracting 495, the reversed number is the original's reverse, but perhaps the reverse is written as a three-digit number, so if the subtraction leads to a three-digit number. Let me see with 863-495=368, which is three digits. So that's correct. So the original number is 863, but it's not an option. \n\nWait the options given are A)368, which is the result of the subtraction. So perhaps the question is phrased differently? Wait, no, the question says \"the sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17...\", so the number in question is the original, not the result. So the answer must be 863, which is not present. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me try plugging in the options to see if any of them work.\n\nCheck option A: 368.\n\nSum digits:17. Sum squares:109. Good. Now subtract 495 from it: 368-495 = -127. Not the reverse (863). So invalid.\n\nOption B:377. Sum digits okay, but squares not. \n\nOption C:288. Sum digits wrong. \n\nOption D:997. Sum digits too big. \n\nOption E:112. Nope. \n\nHmm. None of the options work except A meets the first two conditions but not the third. Wait, but maybe the question is written differently. Let me read again.\n\n\"the sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the reversed number is the same as the original? No, because 495 subtracted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when you subtract 495, you get the reverse, but the reverse is written as a three-digit number, so maybe leading zeros are allowed? For example, if the original number is 368, subtracting 495 gives -127, but maybe written as -127, which isn't the reverse. Or perhaps absolute value? That's not indicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of subtraction? Maybe it's the reverse minus the number equals 495? Let me try that.\n\nIf reversed number = N -495 \u2192 N = reversed +495. \n\nSuppose the correct number is 863, then reversed is 368. 368 +495 = 863, which is correct. So in that case, the equation is correct. But the problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\" to get the reversed, so that's correct. But the options don't have 863.\n\nHmm. The problem must have a typo or the options are wrong, but since this is a multiple choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again the equations.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error when expanding the squares equation.\n\nLet me re-calculate the sum of squares for C=3, A=8, B=6:\n\n8\u00b2 +6\u00b2 +3\u00b2 =64+36+9=109. Correct.\n\nThe sum of digits 8+6+3=17. Correct.\n\nEquation for subtraction: 863-495=368 which is the reverse. So the number is 863, but it's not an option. The options include 368 which is the result of the subtraction, but the question asks for the original number. So the options are wrong?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)368\n\nB)377\n\nC)288\n\nD)997\n\nE)112\n\nHmm. None of these is 863. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation?\n\nWait, let me recheck the quadratic equation steps:\n\nWe had 6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0 \u2192 divide by 2: 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0.\n\nWait, 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0.\n\nLet me try to factor this equation. Let's see:\n\nLooking for factors of 3*30=90 that add up to -19.\n\nHmm, factors of 90: 5 and 18 \u2192 5+18=23. Not. 6 and 15: 6+15=21. 10 and 9: 19. Wait, 10 and 9 multiply to 90. But since the middle term is -19C, perhaps:\n\n3C\u00b2 -10C -9C +30 =0 \u2192 C(3C -10) -3(3C -10) \u2192 (C-3)(3C-10)=0 \u2192 C=3 or C=10/3.\n\nAh! Wait, I think I made a mistake here. The quadratic can be factored?\n\nWait 3C\u00b2 -19C +30.\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a*b =3*30=90 and a +b =-19?\n\nWait since the equation is 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0. So factors would be such that:\n\nWe can split the middle term:\n\n3C\u00b2 -10C -9C +30 =0 \u2192 group:\n\n(3C\u00b2 -10C) + (-9C +30) =0 \u2192 C(3C-10) -3(3C-10)=0 \u2192 (C-3)(3C-10)=0 \u2192 C=3 or C=10/3. \n\nAh! So the roots are C=3 and C=10/3. So C=3.333, which is not an integer. So only C=3 is valid. So that's correct. So the only solution is C=3, leading to 863. \n\nHmm. So the options must have a mistake. But since the problem gives options, perhaps I have to choose the one that meets the first two conditions even if the third doesn't? But the third is crucial. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's conditions. Let me read again:\n\n\"the sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\"\n\nSo the number must satisfy all three conditions. The only candidate that satisfies the first two is option A (368), but it fails the third. The correct number is 863, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the problem's direction? Like, subtract the reversed number from the original to get 495? Let's see:\n\nOriginal - reversed =495. \n\nSo 863 -368 =495. Which is correct. So in that case, the equation would be N - reverse(N) =495, which would be the same as the problem's condition. So the problem's wording says \"subtract 495 from the number, get the reverse\". Which is N -495 = reverse \u2192 so N - reverse =495. Which is correct. \n\nSo the answer is 863, but since it's not there, perhaps there's an error. Alternatively, maybe the options have a typo. Like option A is 863 written as 863 but listed as 368? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Wait, let me try with option C:288.\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum 18. Not 17. So no.\n\nOption D:997. Sum is 25. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation for the reverse?\n\nWait, the reversed number is 100C +10B +A. Let me see, if the number is 377 (option B), then the reverse is 773. 377 -495 is -118. Not 773. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is in base 10? Probably.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number when subtracted by 495 gives the reverse, but the reverse is not necessarily three digits. Wait, but the original is three digits. Let me try option A:368. 368-495 =-127. The reverse of 368 is 863. Not equal to -127.\n\nHmm. Since the only possible answer according to the equations is 863, but it's not an option, perhaps the question has a mistake. However, given the options provided, the only one that meets the first two conditions is option A (368), so maybe that's the answer they expect, even though the third condition doesn't hold. But that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me try plugging in option C:288. \n\nSum of digits: 2+8+8=18. Not 17. \n\nOption B:377. Sum is 17. Squares: 9+49+49=107. Close but not 109. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation for the squares. Let me re-calculate for option B: 3^2 +7^2 +7^2 =9+49+49=107. So no.\n\nOption A:3+6+8=17, squares sum 109. So that's the only one that meets the first two conditions. Maybe the question intended that the subtraction is the reverse, but the problem's third condition is written incorrectly? Or perhaps the question requires the reverse to be the same as the number minus 495 even if negative? But then the reverse would have to be 368-495 =-127, which isn't the reverse of 368.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since the problem gives options and the correct answer must be there, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me try re-solving with another approach.\n\nLet me try each option:\n\nOption A: 368. \n\nCheck subtraction: 368-495= -127. Reverse of 368 is 863. Not equal. So no.\n\nOption B:377. Subtract 495 \u2192 377-495= -118. Reverse is 773. Not equal.\n\nOption C:288. 288-495= -207. Reverse is 882. Not equal.\n\nOption D:997-495=502. Reverse is 799. Not equal.\n\nOption E:112-495= -383. Reverse is 211. Not equal.\n\nNone of them satisfy the third condition. So this is impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem said adding 495 instead of subtracting? Let me check that.\n\nIf the problem said \"add 495\", then for 368+495=863, which is the reverse. Then the number would be 368, which is option A. So maybe the problem had a typo and it's supposed to be adding? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem as \"subtract\" but it was \"add\". If that's the case, then option A would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says subtract the reverse from the number to get 495? Let me see:\n\nN - reverse(N) =495. Which is what the correct number (863) does. But the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So that's the same as N -495= reverse \u2192 N - reverse =495. So the correct number is indeed 863. \n\nGiven that the options don't include it, but option A is the reverse, maybe the question was reversed? Like the reverse is the number minus 495, so the original number is the reverse of the result. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have a mistake. Since this is an exam question, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check once again.\n\nWait, let me try with option C:288. \n\nWait, A is C+5. Let's see if any of the options fit A=C+5.\n\nOption A:368. A=3, C=8 \u2192 A - C =-5. Not 5. So no.\n\nOption B:377 \u2192 A=3, C=7 \u2192 A-C= -4. Not 5.\n\nOption C:288 \u2192 A=2, C=8 \u2192 A-C= -6. Not 5.\n\nOption D:997 \u2192 A=9, C=7 \u2192 difference is +2. Not 5.\n\nOption E:112 \u2192 A=1, C=2 \u2192 difference -1. \n\nHmm. None of the options have A =C+5. Wait, so that's a problem. The equation from the subtraction requires that A = C+5, but none of the options meet that. \n\nSo, the correct number must have A = C+5. Let's see:\n\nFor example, if C=3 \u2192 A=8 \u2192 8xx. The options don't have that. \n\nIf C=4 \u2192 A=9. Then B would be 12-2*4=4. So the number would be 944? Let's check sum of digits 9+4+4=17. Squares:81+16+16=113. Not 109.\n\nC=2 \u2192 A=7 \u2192 B=12-4=8. Number 782. Sum digits:7+8+2=17. Squares:49+64+4=117. No.\n\nC=1 \u2192 A=6 \u2192 B=12-2=10 \u2192 B is 10, which is not a digit. So invalid.\n\nC=5 \u2192 A=10 \u2192 invalid digit.\n\nSo only C=3 gives valid digits. So the number is 863, which is not an option. \n\nHmm. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the problem's options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is 368 (option A) because it meets the first two conditions, and the third is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the equations.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem says the sum of the squares is 109, but I miscalculated for another option. Let me check option B:377 again.\n\n3\u00b2 +7\u00b2 +7\u00b2 =9+49+49=107. Not 109. \n\nOption C:288 \u2192 4+64+64=132.\n\nOption D:997 \u219281+81+49=211. \n\nOption E:1+1+4=6.\n\nSo only A and the correct 863 have the correct sum of squares. \n\nHmm. Since the problem is multiple-choice, and the only possible candidate is A, even though it fails the third condition, maybe I made a mistake in the third condition's calculation. Let me recheck that.\n\nOriginal number is 368. Subtract 495: 368-495 =-127. The reverse of 368 is 863. But -127 is not 863. So that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the difference between the number and its reverse is 495? Like N - reverse(N)=495. Which would be the case for 863-368=495. But the problem states \"subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse\", so that would require N -495 = reverse \u2192 N - reverse =495. Which is exactly the case for 863. \n\nSince the options don't include 863, but option A is the reverse, perhaps the question had a typo and they meant the reverse is when you subtract from 495? Like 495 - N = reverse. Then 495 -368=127, which isn't the reverse. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question was supposed to say subtract the reverse from the number to get 495, which would be N - reverse =495 \u2192 which is satisfied by 863. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. \n\nIn that case, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose the number is ABC, and when you subtract 495 you get CBA. So equation:\n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A \u2192 which we did earlier. \n\nWe found that A = C+5. So the hundreds digit must be 5 more than the units digit. Looking at the options:\n\nCheck each option's A and C:\n\nA)368 \u2192 A=3, C=8 \u2192 3-8= -5 \u2192 not +5.\n\nB)377 \u2192 A=3, C=7 \u2192 difference -4.\n\nC)288 \u2192 A=2, C=8 \u2192 difference -6.\n\nD)997 \u2192 A=9, C=7 \u2192 difference +2.\n\nE)112 \u2192 A=1, C=2 \u2192 difference -1.\n\nNone of them have A = C+5. So none of the options satisfy the first condition derived from the equation. \n\nThis means that there's no correct option, but since the problem gives options, perhaps the question is different. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's first condition?\n\nWait the first condition is the sum of digits is 17. The options A has 3+6+8=17, which is correct. The sum of squares is also correct. So the problem might have a mistake in the third condition. But the third condition is critical. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says subtract 445 instead of 495? Let me see:\n\nIf it were 445, then 863-445=418, which isn't the reverse. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, subtract 444: 863-444=419, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract 396? 863-396=467. Not reverse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number is 368. Let me see what subtraction gives: 368- something gives the reverse. 368 - (368 - reverse) = reverse. Wait, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the difference between the number and its reverse is 495. That is, N - reverse(N) =495. Which is true for 863-368=495. So the question might have a typo in the wording. If that's the case, then the correct number is 863, but since it's not an option, I can't choose it. \n\nAlternatively, the options might have a typo. Like option C is 863 instead of 288. \n\nGiven that none of the options fit all conditions except the first two for option A, but the third condition is not met, perhaps the problem is designed to have a trick? Or maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me try the option A again. 368. The reverse is 863. If you subtract 495 from 368, you get a negative number. But perhaps the problem allows the reversed number to be written with leading zeros? Like, if the result is -127, but reversing the digits of the original (368) gives 863. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the absolute value of the subtraction is the reverse? Like |N -495|=reverse(N). For option A: |368-495|=127. Not 863. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since the problem requires an answer from the options, and the only one that satisfies the first two conditions is option A, even though the third is not met, perhaps that's the intended answer. Or maybe I made a mistake in the equations. \n\nWait, let me check the equation again. Let me re-calculate the equation for the sum of squares when C=3.\n\nYes, 8\u00b2+6\u00b2+3\u00b2=64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nThe sum of digits is 17. Correct. \n\nThe subtraction gives 368, which is the reverse. So the correct number must be 863. \n\nSince it's not an option, perhaps the answer is A)368, but the question had a mistake in the direction of subtraction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me try a different approach. Suppose the number is 368 (option A), then its reverse is 863. The difference between them is 863-368=495. So 863-368=495. So if the question had said \"the number minus its reverse is 495\", then the correct number is 863. But the problem states \"subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse\", which requires that 863-495=368, which is true. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, which is not listed. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't include it, but the closest is option A (the reverse), perhaps the question intended the reverse to be the number after subtraction, so the original number is the reverse of the result. \n\nWait, but then the original number would be 863, which subtracted by 495 gives 368 (the reverse). So the question is correct, but the answer options are wrong. \n\nIn that case, since the problem is presented as is, and I have to choose from the options, I might have to pick the one that fits the first two conditions, which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different solution path that I missed. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose I didn't use equations but tried the options.\n\nCheck option A:368.\n\nSum digits:17, sum squares 109. Good. \n\nSubtract 495:368-495 =-127. Not reverse. \n\nOption B:377. Sum digits okay, squares 107. \n\nOption C:288 sum digits no.\n\nOption D:997 sum digits no.\n\nE: no.\n\nSo no option fits all three conditions. \n\nHmm. The problem must have an error. Since the options don't include the correct answer, but the problem requires an answer, perhaps I should recheck my equations.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in the equation A = C+5. Let me re-examine the subtraction equation.\n\nThe equation was 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A-C=5. So A = C+5. That's correct. \n\nThus, the hundreds digit must be exactly 5 more than the units digit. Looking at the options, none have that. So there's no correct answer in the options. \n\nPerhaps the problem's correct answer is 863, and the options are wrong. But since I have to choose from the given options, maybe the intended answer is A, and there was a mistake in the problem's third condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares for option C. Let me see option C:288. \n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum squares:4+64+64=132. Not 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different sum of squares. Like 107 instead of 109. Then option B would be correct. \n\nBut the problem states 109. \n\nWell, given the options provided, I think the only possible answer that matches two conditions is option A. But the third condition is critical. Since none of the options work, perhaps the question is flawed. But since I have to choose from the given options, maybe I made a mistake and option C is the answer. \n\nWait, let me try option C:288.\n\nDigits:2,8,8. Sum is 18, so no.\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me see:\n\nThe equation after substituting was 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0. \n\nWait, maybe I should have multiplied differently. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0.\n\nDivide by 2: 3C\u00b2-19C +30=0 \u2192 correct. \n\nSolutions: C = [19 \u00b1\u221a(361-360)]/6 \u2192 [19\u00b11]/6 \u2192 20/6 or 18/6. \n\nSo C=3 is the only valid digit. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, not in options. \n\nHmm. Since this is a multiple-choice question, and the options don't include the correct answer, but option A is the reverse of the correct number, perhaps the question was intended to ask for the reversed number after subtraction, which would be 368. But that would mean the original number is 863, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different condition. Maybe the sum of the squares is 107? Then option B is correct, but the problem says 109. \n\nHmm. I think there's a mistake in the options. Since the problem requires an answer, and given that the only option that fits the first two conditions is A, I'll go with that, assuming that perhaps the third condition was miscalculated by the problem's author, or there's a typo in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the equation for the reverse number. Let me try another way. Let me suppose the number is 368 (option A). The reverse is 863. \n\nIf I add 495 to 368, I get 863. So 368 +495 =863. So if the question had said \"add 495 to the number to get the reverse\", then option A is correct. \n\nPerhaps the problem had a typo, and the correct answer is A. \n\nGiven that possibility, I'll choose option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem requires finding a three-digit number that satisfies three conditions: the sum of its digits is 17, the sum of the squares of its digits is 109, and subtracting 495 from the number yields its reverse. \n\nLet the number be \\(100A + 10B + C\\). The equations derived are:\n1. \\(A + B + C = 17\\)\n2. \\(A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109\\)\n3. \\(100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\\), simplifying to \\(A - C = 5\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(A = C + 5\\) into the first equation gives \\(2C + B = 12\\), so \\(B = 12 - 2C\\). Substituting into the second equation yields a quadratic equation \\(3C^2 - 19C + 30 = 0\\). Solving this gives \\(C = 3\\), leading to \\(A = 8\\), \\(B = 6\\), forming the number 863. \n\nHowever, 863 is not among the options. Checking the options:\n- **A) 368**: Satisfies the first two conditions (sum 17, squares sum 109), but subtracting 495 gives -127, not its reverse (863).\n- Other options fail the first two conditions.\n\nDespite the discrepancy in the third condition, **A) 368** is the only option meeting the first two criteria. The problem might have a typo, but based on the given options, **A) 368** is the best fit.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to find a three-digit number where the sum of its digits is 17, the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, and when I subtract 495 from it, the result is the reverse of the original number. The options are given, so maybe I can check each one, but maybe solving it step by step would be better.\n\nLet me denote the three-digit number as ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B the tens, and C the units. So the number itself is 100A + 10B + C. The reverse would be 100C + 10B + A. The problem says that when we subtract 495 from the original number, we get the reversed number. So the equation would be:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\n\nHmm, let's rearrange that equation. Subtract the right side from both sides, but maybe better to bring similar terms together.\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\nOriginal number - 495 = reversed number.\n\nSo, 100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B +A\n\nSubtract 10B from both sides, which cancels them out. Then:\n\n100A + C -495 = 100C + A\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n100A + C -495 -100C -A =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(100A - A) + (C -100C) -495 =0 \u2192 99A -99C -495 =0\n\nHmm, factor out 99? Let's see:\n\n99(A - C) = 495 \u2192 A - C = 495 /99 = 5. So A - C =5. \n\nSo that's one equation: A = C +5.\n\nAnother condition is that the sum of the digits is 17: A + B + C =17.\n\nThird condition is the sum of the squares of the digits is 109: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. A = C +5\n\n2. A + B + C =17 \u2192 substituting A gives (C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B +5 =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B =12-2C\n\n3. A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109. Substitute A and B from above.\n\nLet me write equation 3:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\nFirst term: (C\u00b2 +10C +25)\n\nSecond term: (12-2C)^2 \u2192 144 -48C +4C\u00b2\n\nThird term: C\u00b2.\n\nAdding all together:\n\nC\u00b2 +10C +25 +144 -48C +4C\u00b2 + C\u00b2 \n\nCombine like terms:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2\n\n10C -48C = -38C\n\n25+144=169\n\nSo total equation: 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109.\n\nSubtract 109:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0\n\nHmm, divide all terms by 2? Let's see: 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0.\n\nNow, solve quadratic equation 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0.\n\nUse quadratic formula: C = [19 \u00b1 sqrt(361 - 360)] /6.\n\nWait, discriminant D = (19)^2 -4*3*30 = 361 - 360 =1.\n\nSo sqrt(1) is 1. Therefore,\n\nC = [19 \u00b11]/6 \u2192 two possibilities:\n\nC=(19+1)/6=20/6\u22483.333... Not integer. Since C is a digit (0-9), must be integer.\n\nOr C=(19-1)/6=18/6=3. So C=3.\n\nSo C=3. Then A = C +5 =8.\n\nThen B =12-2C \u2192 12-6=6.\n\nSo the digits are A=8, B=6, C=3. So the number is 863? Wait, but looking at the options, none of them is 863. The options are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. Hmm, so that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check my equations again.\n\nLet me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\nFirst, the subtraction equation leading to A - C =5. That seems right.\n\nSum of digits: A + B + C =17 \u2192 substituting A = C+5 gives (C+5) + B +C =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B=12-2C. That's correct.\n\nSum of squares equation: (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 =109.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the expansion again:\n\nFirst term: (C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25\n\nSecond term: (12-2C)^2 = (12)^2 - 2*12*2C + (2C)^2 \u2192 144 -48C +4C\u00b2. Wait, no, wait: (a - b)^2 is a\u00b2-2ab +b\u00b2. So 12 squared is 144, minus 2*(12)*(2C)=48C, plus (2C)^2=4C\u00b2. So that term is correct.\n\nThird term is C\u00b2. So adding all three:\n\nFirst term: C\u00b2 +10C +25\n\nSecond: 4C\u00b2 -48C +144\n\nThird: C\u00b2\n\nTotal:\n\nC\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2\n\n10C -48C = -38C\n\n25+144=169\n\nSo equation is 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109 \u2192 6C\u00b2-38C +60=0 \u2192 dividing by 2 gives 3C\u00b2-19C +30=0 \u2192 correct.\n\nSolutions: [19 \u00b1\u221a(361-360)]/6 \u2192 sqrt(1) so 20/6 and 18/6. 18/6 is 3. So C=3.\n\nThus, digits would be A=8, B=6, C=3. So the number is 863. But this isn't an option. Hmm. That's an issue. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup?\n\nWait, let me check the reverse part again. The original number minus 495 equals the reversed digits. Let me see if 863 -495 equals 368. Let's compute 863-495: 863-400=463, 463-95=368. Yes, so 368 is the reverse. But the options include 368 as option A. Wait, so the original number would be 863? But that's not among the options either. Wait, the options are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112.\n\nHmm. So the problem says \"the number\" which when subtracted by 495 gives the reversed number. Wait, maybe I reversed the order? Let me check the equation again.\n\nWait, the equation was: Original number -495 = reversed number. So if original is 863, then 863-495=368, which is the reverse (368 is the reverse of 863? Wait, 863 reversed is 368, yes. So the original number would be 863, but that's not an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the equations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in solving the quadratic. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the sum of squares of digits: If the number was 863, the sum of squares would be 8\u00b2+6\u00b2+3\u00b2=64+36+9=109. Which matches the third condition. The sum of digits is 8+6+3=17. So that's correct. So the number is 863, but it's not in the options. That's a problem.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I messed up the equations?\n\nWait, looking at the options again, option A is 368. Let me check that. Let's see if 368 is the original number. Then subtracting 495 would give a negative number? Wait, 368-495 is -127. But the reversed number of 368 is 863. But that's not equal. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe the problem states that subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. So if the correct number is 863, which gives 368 when subtracted by 495, then 368 is the reverse. But the options don't include 863, so that suggests I must have made an error.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me re-examine the equations again.\n\nOriginal equation: N - 495 = reverse(N). Let me write N as 100A +10B + C, reverse is 100C +10B + A.\n\nSo equation: 100A +10B +C -495 = 100C +10B + A \u2192 moving terms:\n\n100A - A -495 = 100C - C \u2192 99A -99C =495 \u2192 99(A - C)=495 \u2192 A-C =5. That's correct.\n\nSo A is C+5. Then sum A+B+C=17 \u2192 (C+5) + B +C =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B=12-2C. So that's correct.\n\nThen sum of squares: (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C^2 =109.\n\nWait, let me calculate that for C=3:\n\n(3+5)^2 + (12-6)^2 + 9 \u2192 8\u00b2 +6\u00b2 +3\u00b2 \u2192 64+36+9=109. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. So the problem is that the correct answer isn't listed. Wait, looking at the options again:\n\nA)368 \u2192 which is the reversed number. But the question asks for the original number. So perhaps the correct answer is not in the options? But that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation?\n\nWait, maybe I swapped the subtraction direction? Let me check the problem statement again.\n\n\"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\"\n\nYes, so N -495 = reversed N. So original is N, subtract 495 to get reversed N. So the original N must be larger than 495, since reversed N would be a three-digit number (since original is three-digit, reversed is also three-digit). So 863 is a valid three-digit number, but not in options. Wait, looking at the options, the closest is option C)288. Let's see what happens if I try option C: 288.\n\nLet's check 288: sum of digits is 2+8+8=18. Not 17. So that can't be.\n\nOption D:997. Sum is 9+9+7=25. Not 17.\n\nOption B:377. Sum 3+7+7=17. Okay. Let's check its squares: 9 +49 +49= 107. Not 109. So no.\n\nOption A:368. Sum is 3+6+8=17. Sum of squares: 9+36+64= 109. Oh! Wait a second. Wait, 368's digits sum to 17, and squares sum to 109. But according to the problem, the original number minus 495 should be the reverse. Let's see what happens if the original number is 368. 368-495 is negative, so that can't be. But maybe the reverse is 863, but 368-495 is negative. So that's not possible. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me see option B: 377. Let's check the conditions.\n\nSum digits: 3+7+7=17. Good. Sum squares: 9 +49 +49=107. Not 109. So that's close but not correct.\n\nOption C:288 \u2192 sum digits 2+8+8=18. No.\n\nOption E:112 \u2192 sum is 4. No.\n\nHmm. The only one that matches the sum of squares and digits is option A:368, but the subtraction gives a negative number, so that can't be the original number. Unless I messed up the equation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem says subtract the number from 495? That would reverse the equation, but the wording is \"subtract 495 from the number\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reversed number is not the reverse of the original, but the reverse of the digits? Wait, the problem says \"the same digits written in the reverse order\". So reverse of the original number. So 368 reversed is 863, so original N must be 863, which is not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the quadratic solution?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the quadratic equation:\n\nThe equation after substituting was:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60=0 \u2192 divide by 2 \u2192 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0.\n\nLet me compute discriminant again: (19)^2 -4*3*30 = 361 - 360 =1. Correct. So roots are (19\u00b11)/6 \u2192 20/6 and 18/6. 18/6 is 3, so C=3. So that's correct. Then A=8, B=6, C=3. So the number is 863. But it's not in the options. That's a problem. So perhaps the options are wrong? Or maybe I have a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait, maybe the equation is reversed? Let me think again. The problem states that subtracting 495 from the number gives the reversed number. So N -495 = reversed N.\n\nBut perhaps the reversed number is written with the same digits in reverse order, but the problem didn't specify that the reversed number is a three-digit number? Wait, but the original is three digits, so reversed would also be three digits. Unless leading zero is allowed, but then the reversed number would be two digits. But that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the equation setup. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal number: 100A +10B + C\n\nReversed number: 100C +10B + A\n\nEquation: (100A +10B +C) -495 = 100C +10B +A \u2192 \n\nYes, so rearranged:\n\n100A +10B +C -495 -100C -10B -A =0 \u2192 99A -99C -495=0 \u2192 99(A - C) =495 \u2192 A-C=5. Correct.\n\nHmm. So the problem must have an error, but since the options are given, maybe I need to check them again. Let me check each option to see which one fits all three conditions.\n\nLet's check option A:368.\n\nDigits: 3,6,8. Sum:3+6+8=17. Good. Sum of squares: 9+36+64= 109. That's correct. Then subtract 495 from 368: 368-495= -127. But the reverse of 368 is 863, so that's not equal. So this can't be the answer.\n\nOption B:377. Sum 3+7+7=17. Squares:9+49+49=107. Not 109. So no.\n\nOption C:288. Sum 2+8+8=18. Not 17.\n\nOption D:997. Sum 25. No.\n\nOption E:112. Sum 4. No.\n\nHmm. So the only one that meets the first two conditions (sum and squares) is option A. But the third condition fails. So that's confusing. Unless I made a mistake in the third condition.\n\nWait, let's see the third condition for option A: 368 -495 is -127. The reverse of 368 is 863, which is not equal to -127. So that's not valid.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem requires the reverse number to be N minus 495, but perhaps I got the direction wrong? Like, maybe the reverse is N -495, but the reverse is a three-digit number, so N must be bigger than 495. So the original number must be larger than 495. The options that are over 495 are options B (377?), no. Wait, 377 is 377, which is less than 495. 288 is less. 997 is over. 368 is 368. So only 997 and 288? Wait 288 is 288, less than 495. 997 is way over.\n\nLet me check option D:997. Subtract 495 gives 502. Reverse of 997 is 799. 502 is not 799. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me think again. Let me try to check if there's another solution for the quadratic equation.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation had only one valid solution (C=3). Because the other solution was C=20/6 which is ~3.333, which is not an integer. So there's only one solution here. But that gives 863 which isn't in options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there was an error in the problem's options? Or perhaps I misapplied the equation.\n\nWait another thought: Maybe when subtracting 495, the reversed number is the original's reverse, but perhaps the reverse is written as a three-digit number, so if the subtraction leads to a three-digit number. Let me see with 863-495=368, which is three digits. So that's correct. So the original number is 863, but it's not an option. \n\nWait the options given are A)368, which is the result of the subtraction. So perhaps the question is phrased differently? Wait, no, the question says \"the sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17...\", so the number in question is the original, not the result. So the answer must be 863, which is not present. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me try plugging in the options to see if any of them work.\n\nCheck option A: 368.\n\nSum digits:17. Sum squares:109. Good. Now subtract 495 from it: 368-495 = -127. Not the reverse (863). So invalid.\n\nOption B:377. Sum digits okay, but squares not. \n\nOption C:288. Sum digits wrong. \n\nOption D:997. Sum digits too big. \n\nOption E:112. Nope. \n\nHmm. None of the options work except A meets the first two conditions but not the third. Wait, but maybe the question is written differently. Let me read again.\n\n\"the sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.\"\n\nWait, perhaps the reversed number is the same as the original? No, because 495 subtracted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when you subtract 495, you get the reverse, but the reverse is written as a three-digit number, so maybe leading zeros are allowed? For example, if the original number is 368, subtracting 495 gives -127, but maybe written as -127, which isn't the reverse. Or perhaps absolute value? That's not indicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of subtraction? Maybe it's the reverse minus the number equals 495? Let me try that.\n\nIf reversed number = N -495 \u2192 N = reversed +495. \n\nSuppose the correct number is 863, then reversed is 368. 368 +495 = 863, which is correct. So in that case, the equation is correct. But the problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\" to get the reversed, so that's correct. But the options don't have 863.\n\nHmm. The problem must have a typo or the options are wrong, but since this is a multiple choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again the equations.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error when expanding the squares equation.\n\nLet me re-calculate the sum of squares for C=3, A=8, B=6:\n\n8\u00b2 +6\u00b2 +3\u00b2 =64+36+9=109. Correct.\n\nThe sum of digits 8+6+3=17. Correct.\n\nEquation for subtraction: 863-495=368 which is the reverse. So the number is 863, but it's not an option. The options include 368 which is the result of the subtraction, but the question asks for the original number. So the options are wrong?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)368\n\nB)377\n\nC)288\n\nD)997\n\nE)112\n\nHmm. None of these is 863. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation?\n\nWait, let me recheck the quadratic equation steps:\n\nWe had 6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0 \u2192 divide by 2: 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0.\n\nWait, 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0.\n\nLet me try to factor this equation. Let's see:\n\nLooking for factors of 3*30=90 that add up to -19.\n\nHmm, factors of 90: 5 and 18 \u2192 5+18=23. Not. 6 and 15: 6+15=21. 10 and 9: 19. Wait, 10 and 9 multiply to 90. But since the middle term is -19C, perhaps:\n\n3C\u00b2 -10C -9C +30 =0 \u2192 C(3C -10) -3(3C -10) \u2192 (C-3)(3C-10)=0 \u2192 C=3 or C=10/3.\n\nAh! Wait, I think I made a mistake here. The quadratic can be factored?\n\nWait 3C\u00b2 -19C +30.\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a*b =3*30=90 and a +b =-19?\n\nWait since the equation is 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0. So factors would be such that:\n\nWe can split the middle term:\n\n3C\u00b2 -10C -9C +30 =0 \u2192 group:\n\n(3C\u00b2 -10C) + (-9C +30) =0 \u2192 C(3C-10) -3(3C-10)=0 \u2192 (C-3)(3C-10)=0 \u2192 C=3 or C=10/3. \n\nAh! So the roots are C=3 and C=10/3. So C=3.333, which is not an integer. So only C=3 is valid. So that's correct. So the only solution is C=3, leading to 863. \n\nHmm. So the options must have a mistake. But since the problem gives options, perhaps I have to choose the one that meets the first two conditions even if the third doesn't? But the third is crucial. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's conditions. Let me read again:\n\n\"the sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\"\n\nSo the number must satisfy all three conditions. The only candidate that satisfies the first two is option A (368), but it fails the third. The correct number is 863, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the problem's direction? Like, subtract the reversed number from the original to get 495? Let's see:\n\nOriginal - reversed =495. \n\nSo 863 -368 =495. Which is correct. So in that case, the equation would be N - reverse(N) =495, which would be the same as the problem's condition. So the problem's wording says \"subtract 495 from the number, get the reverse\". Which is N -495 = reverse \u2192 so N - reverse =495. Which is correct. \n\nSo the answer is 863, but since it's not there, perhaps there's an error. Alternatively, maybe the options have a typo. Like option A is 863 written as 863 but listed as 368? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Wait, let me try with option C:288.\n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum 18. Not 17. So no.\n\nOption D:997. Sum is 25. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation for the reverse?\n\nWait, the reversed number is 100C +10B +A. Let me see, if the number is 377 (option B), then the reverse is 773. 377 -495 is -118. Not 773. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is in base 10? Probably.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number when subtracted by 495 gives the reverse, but the reverse is not necessarily three digits. Wait, but the original is three digits. Let me try option A:368. 368-495 =-127. The reverse of 368 is 863. Not equal to -127.\n\nHmm. Since the only possible answer according to the equations is 863, but it's not an option, perhaps the question has a mistake. However, given the options provided, the only one that meets the first two conditions is option A (368), so maybe that's the answer they expect, even though the third condition doesn't hold. But that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me try plugging in option C:288. \n\nSum of digits: 2+8+8=18. Not 17. \n\nOption B:377. Sum is 17. Squares: 9+49+49=107. Close but not 109. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation for the squares. Let me re-calculate for option B: 3^2 +7^2 +7^2 =9+49+49=107. So no.\n\nOption A:3+6+8=17, squares sum 109. So that's the only one that meets the first two conditions. Maybe the question intended that the subtraction is the reverse, but the problem's third condition is written incorrectly? Or perhaps the question requires the reverse to be the same as the number minus 495 even if negative? But then the reverse would have to be 368-495 =-127, which isn't the reverse of 368.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since the problem gives options and the correct answer must be there, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me try re-solving with another approach.\n\nLet me try each option:\n\nOption A: 368. \n\nCheck subtraction: 368-495= -127. Reverse of 368 is 863. Not equal. So no.\n\nOption B:377. Subtract 495 \u2192 377-495= -118. Reverse is 773. Not equal.\n\nOption C:288. 288-495= -207. Reverse is 882. Not equal.\n\nOption D:997-495=502. Reverse is 799. Not equal.\n\nOption E:112-495= -383. Reverse is 211. Not equal.\n\nNone of them satisfy the third condition. So this is impossible. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem said adding 495 instead of subtracting? Let me check that.\n\nIf the problem said \"add 495\", then for 368+495=863, which is the reverse. Then the number would be 368, which is option A. So maybe the problem had a typo and it's supposed to be adding? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem as \"subtract\" but it was \"add\". If that's the case, then option A would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says subtract the reverse from the number to get 495? Let me see:\n\nN - reverse(N) =495. Which is what the correct number (863) does. But the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So that's the same as N -495= reverse \u2192 N - reverse =495. So the correct number is indeed 863. \n\nGiven that the options don't include it, but option A is the reverse, maybe the question was reversed? Like the reverse is the number minus 495, so the original number is the reverse of the result. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have a mistake. Since this is an exam question, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check once again.\n\nWait, let me try with option C:288. \n\nWait, A is C+5. Let's see if any of the options fit A=C+5.\n\nOption A:368. A=3, C=8 \u2192 A - C =-5. Not 5. So no.\n\nOption B:377 \u2192 A=3, C=7 \u2192 A-C= -4. Not 5.\n\nOption C:288 \u2192 A=2, C=8 \u2192 A-C= -6. Not 5.\n\nOption D:997 \u2192 A=9, C=7 \u2192 difference is +2. Not 5.\n\nOption E:112 \u2192 A=1, C=2 \u2192 difference -1. \n\nHmm. None of the options have A =C+5. Wait, so that's a problem. The equation from the subtraction requires that A = C+5, but none of the options meet that. \n\nSo, the correct number must have A = C+5. Let's see:\n\nFor example, if C=3 \u2192 A=8 \u2192 8xx. The options don't have that. \n\nIf C=4 \u2192 A=9. Then B would be 12-2*4=4. So the number would be 944? Let's check sum of digits 9+4+4=17. Squares:81+16+16=113. Not 109.\n\nC=2 \u2192 A=7 \u2192 B=12-4=8. Number 782. Sum digits:7+8+2=17. Squares:49+64+4=117. No.\n\nC=1 \u2192 A=6 \u2192 B=12-2=10 \u2192 B is 10, which is not a digit. So invalid.\n\nC=5 \u2192 A=10 \u2192 invalid digit.\n\nSo only C=3 gives valid digits. So the number is 863, which is not an option. \n\nHmm. Therefore, I think there's a mistake in the problem's options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the intended answer is 368 (option A) because it meets the first two conditions, and the third is a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the equations.\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem says the sum of the squares is 109, but I miscalculated for another option. Let me check option B:377 again.\n\n3\u00b2 +7\u00b2 +7\u00b2 =9+49+49=107. Not 109. \n\nOption C:288 \u2192 4+64+64=132.\n\nOption D:997 \u219281+81+49=211. \n\nOption E:1+1+4=6.\n\nSo only A and the correct 863 have the correct sum of squares. \n\nHmm. Since the problem is multiple-choice, and the only possible candidate is A, even though it fails the third condition, maybe I made a mistake in the third condition's calculation. Let me recheck that.\n\nOriginal number is 368. Subtract 495: 368-495 =-127. The reverse of 368 is 863. But -127 is not 863. So that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the difference between the number and its reverse is 495? Like N - reverse(N)=495. Which would be the case for 863-368=495. But the problem states \"subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse\", so that would require N -495 = reverse \u2192 N - reverse =495. Which is exactly the case for 863. \n\nSince the options don't include 863, but option A is the reverse, perhaps the question had a typo and they meant the reverse is when you subtract from 495? Like 495 - N = reverse. Then 495 -368=127, which isn't the reverse. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question was supposed to say subtract the reverse from the number to get 495, which would be N - reverse =495 \u2192 which is satisfied by 863. But since that's not an option, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. \n\nIn that case, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose the number is ABC, and when you subtract 495 you get CBA. So equation:\n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A \u2192 which we did earlier. \n\nWe found that A = C+5. So the hundreds digit must be 5 more than the units digit. Looking at the options:\n\nCheck each option's A and C:\n\nA)368 \u2192 A=3, C=8 \u2192 3-8= -5 \u2192 not +5.\n\nB)377 \u2192 A=3, C=7 \u2192 difference -4.\n\nC)288 \u2192 A=2, C=8 \u2192 difference -6.\n\nD)997 \u2192 A=9, C=7 \u2192 difference +2.\n\nE)112 \u2192 A=1, C=2 \u2192 difference -1.\n\nNone of them have A = C+5. So none of the options satisfy the first condition derived from the equation. \n\nThis means that there's no correct option, but since the problem gives options, perhaps the question is different. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's first condition?\n\nWait the first condition is the sum of digits is 17. The options A has 3+6+8=17, which is correct. The sum of squares is also correct. So the problem might have a mistake in the third condition. But the third condition is critical. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says subtract 445 instead of 495? Let me see:\n\nIf it were 445, then 863-445=418, which isn't the reverse. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, subtract 444: 863-444=419, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe subtract 396? 863-396=467. Not reverse.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number is 368. Let me see what subtraction gives: 368- something gives the reverse. 368 - (368 - reverse) = reverse. Wait, that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires the difference between the number and its reverse is 495. That is, N - reverse(N) =495. Which is true for 863-368=495. So the question might have a typo in the wording. If that's the case, then the correct number is 863, but since it's not an option, I can't choose it. \n\nAlternatively, the options might have a typo. Like option C is 863 instead of 288. \n\nGiven that none of the options fit all conditions except the first two for option A, but the third condition is not met, perhaps the problem is designed to have a trick? Or maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, let me try the option A again. 368. The reverse is 863. If you subtract 495 from 368, you get a negative number. But perhaps the problem allows the reversed number to be written with leading zeros? Like, if the result is -127, but reversing the digits of the original (368) gives 863. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the absolute value of the subtraction is the reverse? Like |N -495|=reverse(N). For option A: |368-495|=127. Not 863. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since the problem requires an answer from the options, and the only one that satisfies the first two conditions is option A, even though the third is not met, perhaps that's the intended answer. Or maybe I made a mistake in the equations. \n\nWait, let me check the equation again. Let me re-calculate the equation for the sum of squares when C=3.\n\nYes, 8\u00b2+6\u00b2+3\u00b2=64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nThe sum of digits is 17. Correct. \n\nThe subtraction gives 368, which is the reverse. So the correct number must be 863. \n\nSince it's not an option, perhaps the answer is A)368, but the question had a mistake in the direction of subtraction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me try a different approach. Suppose the number is 368 (option A), then its reverse is 863. The difference between them is 863-368=495. So 863-368=495. So if the question had said \"the number minus its reverse is 495\", then the correct number is 863. But the problem states \"subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse\", which requires that 863-495=368, which is true. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, which is not listed. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't include it, but the closest is option A (the reverse), perhaps the question intended the reverse to be the number after subtraction, so the original number is the reverse of the result. \n\nWait, but then the original number would be 863, which subtracted by 495 gives 368 (the reverse). So the question is correct, but the answer options are wrong. \n\nIn that case, since the problem is presented as is, and I have to choose from the options, I might have to pick the one that fits the first two conditions, which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different solution path that I missed. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose I didn't use equations but tried the options.\n\nCheck option A:368.\n\nSum digits:17, sum squares 109. Good. \n\nSubtract 495:368-495 =-127. Not reverse. \n\nOption B:377. Sum digits okay, squares 107. \n\nOption C:288 sum digits no.\n\nOption D:997 sum digits no.\n\nE: no.\n\nSo no option fits all three conditions. \n\nHmm. The problem must have an error. Since the options don't include the correct answer, but the problem requires an answer, perhaps I should recheck my equations.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in the equation A = C+5. Let me re-examine the subtraction equation.\n\nThe equation was 99A -99C =495 \u2192 A-C=5. So A = C+5. That's correct. \n\nThus, the hundreds digit must be exactly 5 more than the units digit. Looking at the options, none have that. So there's no correct answer in the options. \n\nPerhaps the problem's correct answer is 863, and the options are wrong. But since I have to choose from the given options, maybe the intended answer is A, and there was a mistake in the problem's third condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares for option C. Let me see option C:288. \n\nDigits 2,8,8. Sum squares:4+64+64=132. Not 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different sum of squares. Like 107 instead of 109. Then option B would be correct. \n\nBut the problem states 109. \n\nWell, given the options provided, I think the only possible answer that matches two conditions is option A. But the third condition is critical. Since none of the options work, perhaps the question is flawed. But since I have to choose from the given options, maybe I made a mistake and option C is the answer. \n\nWait, let me try option C:288.\n\nDigits:2,8,8. Sum is 18, so no.\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me see:\n\nThe equation after substituting was 3C\u00b2-19C+30=0. \n\nWait, maybe I should have multiplied differently. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution:\n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0.\n\nDivide by 2: 3C\u00b2-19C +30=0 \u2192 correct. \n\nSolutions: C = [19 \u00b1\u221a(361-360)]/6 \u2192 [19\u00b11]/6 \u2192 20/6 or 18/6. \n\nSo C=3 is the only valid digit. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, not in options. \n\nHmm. Since this is a multiple-choice question, and the options don't include the correct answer, but option A is the reverse of the correct number, perhaps the question was intended to ask for the reversed number after subtraction, which would be 368. But that would mean the original number is 863, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different condition. Maybe the sum of the squares is 107? Then option B is correct, but the problem says 109. \n\nHmm. I think there's a mistake in the options. Since the problem requires an answer, and given that the only option that fits the first two conditions is A, I'll go with that, assuming that perhaps the third condition was miscalculated by the problem's author, or there's a typo in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the equation for the reverse number. Let me try another way. Let me suppose the number is 368 (option A). The reverse is 863. \n\nIf I add 495 to 368, I get 863. So 368 +495 =863. So if the question had said \"add 495 to the number to get the reverse\", then option A is correct. \n\nPerhaps the problem had a typo, and the correct answer is A. \n\nGiven that possibility, I'll choose option A.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding a three-digit number that satisfies three conditions: the sum of its digits is 17, the sum of the squares of its digits is 109, and subtracting 495 from the number yields its reverse. \n\nLet the number be \\(100A + 10B + C\\). The equations derived are:\n1. \\(A + B + C = 17\\)\n2. \\(A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109\\)\n3. \\(100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\\), simplifying to \\(A - C = 5\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(A = C + 5\\) into the first equation gives \\(2C + B = 12\\), so \\(B = 12 - 2C\\). Substituting into the second equation yields a quadratic equation \\(3C^2 - 19C + 30 = 0\\). Solving this gives \\(C = 3\\), leading to \\(A = 8\\), \\(B = 6\\), forming the number 863. \n\nHowever, 863 is not among the options. Checking the options:\n- **A) 368**: Satisfies the first two conditions (sum 17, squares sum 109), but subtracting 495 gives -127, not its reverse (863).\n- Other options fail the first two conditions.\n\nDespite the discrepancy in the third condition, **A) 368** is the only option meeting the first two criteria. The problem might have a typo, but based on the given options, **A) 368** is the best fit.\n\nAnswer: A",
