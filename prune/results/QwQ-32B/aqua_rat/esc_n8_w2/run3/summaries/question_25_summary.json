      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about Bill's biking speed on a windy day and how far he can go in 21 minutes. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, his normal speed is 15 mph. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So I subtract 4 from 15 to get his windy day speed. Let me do that: 15 minus 4 equals 11. So his speed on a windy day is 11 mph. Got that part.\n\nNow, the question is how far he can travel in 21 minutes. Wait, time is in minutes, but his speed is in hours. Oh right, I need to convert the time to hours. Since 60 minutes is 1 hour, 21 minutes is 21/60 hours. Let me calculate that. 21 divided by 60... that's 0.35 hours. Right?\n\nDistance is speed multiplied by time. So the distance he travels would be 11 mph times 0.35 hours. Let me do that multiplication. 11 * 0.35. Hmm, 11 times 0.3 is 3.3, and 11 times 0.05 is 0.55. Adding those together gives 3.3 + 0.55 = 3.85? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I should calculate it directly. 11 * 0.35. Let me do 11 * 35 divided by 100. 11*35 is... 385? Because 10*35 is 350 plus 1*35 is 35, so 385. So 385 divided by 100 is 3.85. Oh, okay, so that's 3.85 miles. But wait, the options have E as 2.85 and D as 3.85. Hmm.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, 21 minutes is 21/60 hours. 21 divided by 60 is indeed 0.35. So 11 * 0.35. Let me do it another way. 0.35 is the same as 35 minutes per hour? Wait no, 0.35 hours. So 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles. So that would be option D. But looking at the options, D is 3.85. But let me see if maybe I messed up the speed reduction. The problem says his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So original is 15, so 15-4=11. That's correct. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is a trick question? Let me check the options again. The options are A)2, B)2.25, C)3.25, D)3.85, E)2.85. So 3.85 is there. But why is there an E option with 2.85? Hmm, maybe I did something wrong. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Wait, 11 multiplied by 0.35. Let me calculate 11 * 0.35 step by step. 0.3 times 11 is 3.3, and 0.05 times 11 is 0.55. Adding those gives 3.3 +0.55 = 3.85. That's correct. So the answer should be D. But let me check again the question. Wait, the problem says \"how far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes?\" So my calculation seems right. \n\nWait, but maybe the speed reduction is not 4 mph. Wait, the problem says \"his speed is reduced by 4 mph\". So that's subtracting 4 from 15, yes. So 11 mph. So the answer D is correct. Hmm. But why is option E there? Let me see if maybe I miscalculated 21 divided by 60. 21 divided by 60: 21/60 = 0.35. Correct. So 11 * 0.35 is 3.85. So D is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says \"how far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes?\" Yep. So the answer should be D. But let me check the options again. Option D is 3.85. So that must be the correct answer. Hmm, but I thought maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the problem says that on a windy day his speed is reduced by 4 mph, meaning that his speed becomes 4 mph? Wait, no, that would be a big mistake. The wording is \"speed is reduced by 4 mph\"\u2014so subtract 4 from original speed. So 15-4=11. So that's right. \n\nHmm, so the answer is D) 3.85. But let me think again. Wait, maybe I messed up the time conversion. 21 minutes is 21/60 hours. Let me compute that as a decimal again. 21 divided by 60: 60 goes into 21 0.35 times. So yes. So 0.35 hours. \n\nSo 11 multiplied by 0.35 equals 3.85. So yes, D is correct. But why is there an option E? Maybe I misread the question. Let me check the problem again. The options are A)2, B)2.25, C)3.25, D)3.85, E)2.85. So D is an option, so that's the one. I think that's right. Maybe I was overcomplicating. So the answer must be D.\n",
