      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a hollow cube with a size of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm. It's made up of smaller cubes of 1cm each. The question is, when the outer surface is painted, how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this hollow cube. A cube of size 5cm would normally be made up of 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes if it's solid. But since it's hollow, the thickness is 1cm. That probably means that the walls of the cube are 1cm thick. So the hollow part inside must be a smaller cube. Let me think. The outer dimensions are 5cm, so the inner dimensions would be 5 - 2*1 = 3cm, right? Because the thickness is on both sides. So the hollow part is 3x3x3. Therefore, the total number of small cubes in the hollow structure would be the total of the solid cube minus the hollow part. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hollow cube is constructed by removing the inner part. The total number of small cubes in the structure would be (5^3) minus (3^3) since the hollow part is 3x3x3. Let me calculate that: 125 - 27 = 98. Wait, but 3x3x3 is 27, so yes. So there are 98 small cubes in total. But maybe I need to approach this differently because the question is about the number of unpainted faces.\n\nWait, the question is about the total number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. The outer surface is painted. So all the small cubes on the surface have their outer faces painted. But the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow part) would not be painted, so those faces would be unpainted. Also, the faces between the small cubes (the ones that are adjacent to each other) are internal and not painted either. Wait, but the problem might be considering only the outer painted surfaces. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the total number of faces of all small cubes that are not painted. Since the outer surface is painted, the outer faces are painted, but the inner faces (like the ones facing the hollow part, and the ones between the cubes) are not. Hmm, but how do I calculate this?\n\nLet me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the entire cube is hollow, so the structure is like a 5cm cube with walls 1cm thick. So each face of the big cube is a 5x5 grid of small cubes, but since it's hollow, the inner part is empty. The small cubes are arranged such that they form the outer layer of 1cm thickness. So each face of the big cube has a layer of 1cm, so each face is a 5x5 square, but the inner part (the 3x3 in the center of each face) is hollow. Wait, no. Wait, the thickness is 1cm, so the hollow part is a cube of 3cm on each side. So the structure has a 5cm outer cube, with the walls 1cm thick, so the inner hollow space is 3cm on each edge.\n\nTherefore, the total number of small cubes is indeed 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98. So there are 98 small cubes in total. Each small cube has 6 faces. So the total number of faces of all small cubes is 98 * 6 = 588. But some of these are painted, others not. The question is asking for the unpainted ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the total number of unpainted faces. So first, calculate the total faces, then subtract the painted ones. Alternatively, calculate the unpainted directly.\n\nThe outer surface is painted. So any face of a small cube that is on the outside of the big cube is painted. But the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow part) are not painted. Also, the faces between two small cubes (i.e., internal to the structure) are not painted either.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the outer surface is painted. So any face on the outside (i.e., part of the big cube's surface) is painted, and the rest are not. So the unpainted faces include the inner faces (facing the hollow part) and the faces between small cubes (adjacent ones). But perhaps the problem is only considering the inner faces? Or maybe not. Wait, the question is asking how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. So all the faces that are not on the outer surface are unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be (Total faces of all small cubes) minus (Total painted faces).\n\nSo first, total faces: 98 *6 = 588.\n\nTotal painted faces: the outer surface area of the big cube. Since the big cube is 5cm, each face is 5x5 =25, and there are 6 faces, so 25*6=150. But wait, each face of the big cube is made up of small cubes' faces. So the total painted faces would be exactly the surface area of the big cube in terms of small cube faces. Since each face of the big cube is 5x5 small faces, so yes, 25 per face, 6 faces gives 150. So the total painted is 150. So the unpainted would be 588-150=438? Wait, but that would be answer A) 438. But wait, I need to check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. The structure is hollow. So the outer surface is painted, but the inner surfaces (the hollow parts) are not part of the structure. Wait, the inner surfaces are part of the small cubes. For example, the small cubes that are on the edges of the hollow part would have faces adjacent to the hollow space, which are not painted. So those faces are part of the small cubes but not painted. So the painted faces are only those on the outside, but the inner walls (if any) would also be part of the structure but not painted. Wait, but in this problem, the cube is hollow, so the inner space is empty. So the small cubes that form the walls of the hollow cube have their inner faces (facing the hollow space) exposed but not painted. So those inner faces are also unpainted, so they should be counted in the unpainted total.\n\nHmm, so my previous calculation may be wrong because I didn't account for the inner faces. Let me think again.\n\nThe total number of small cubes is 98. Each has 6 faces. So total faces are 98*6 = 588.\n\nThe painted faces are only the ones on the outer surface of the big cube. The outer surface area is 5x5x6 =150 small faces. So those 150 are painted. The remaining faces are either on the inner surfaces (facing the hollow part) or between the small cubes (adjacent ones, so internal). Those are unpainted.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate the total unpainted faces? Alternatively, the total painted is 150, so unpainted is 588-150 =438, which would be option A. But the options include A)438. But maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow space) are also part of the small cubes and are considered unpainted. The problem says the outer surface is painted. So any face of a small cube that's on the exterior (part of the big cube's surface) is painted. The other faces (either adjacent to another small cube or to the hollow space) are not painted. So in that case, the total painted is indeed 150, so unpainted is 588-150=438. So answer A?\n\nBut wait, I remember sometimes in these problems, the hollow parts contribute to the inner faces. Let me think again. Let's take an example of a smaller cube. Suppose the cube is 3cm with 1cm thickness. Then the inner hollow would be 1cm, so total cubes would be 27-1=26. Wait, but maybe that's a different scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the approach is to compute the total number of small cube faces on the inside. Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: the total number of unpainted faces is equal to the inner surface area plus the internal faces between the small cubes. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think of each small cube and count their unpainted faces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of unpainted faces can be calculated by subtracting the painted faces (150) from the total faces (588), but that gives 438, which is option A. However, I should check if there's another way this could be wrong.\n\nWait, but perhaps the inner surfaces (those facing the hollow part) are part of the small cubes. For example, each face on the inside (towards the hollow) of the hollow cube's walls would be an unpainted face. So how many of those are there?\n\nThe inner surface area would be the surface area of the hollow cube's inner walls. Since the inner dimensions are 3x3x3, the inner surface area would be 3x3x6 (since each face of the inner hollow is 3x3, but actually, the inner surface is the inside of the walls). Wait, no. The hollow is a 3cm cube, so the inner surface area of the structure would be the surface area of that 3cm cube. Because the walls are 1cm thick. So each face of the hollow's inner cube is a 3x3 square, and there are 6 faces. So the inner surface area would be 3x3x6 =54 small cube faces. Each of these corresponds to a face of a small cube that is adjacent to the hollow space. These are also unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be the inner surface area (54) plus the internal faces between the small cubes (the ones not on the outer surface or inner surface).\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider that the total number of faces is 588. The painted ones are the outer surface (150), and the inner surface (54) are also unpainted. But also, the small cubes have adjacent faces which are internal (not on the outer or inner surface). So total unpainted would be (588 - 150) because all except the outer painted ones are unpainted. The inner surface is part of that calculation. So maybe the first approach was right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner surface is part of the small cubes. Let me see. Let me take an example of a single wall. Let's think of the front face of the big cube. The front face is 5x5 small cubes. The hollow is 3cm, so the inner part of the front face is a 3x3 square that is hollow. So the front face's small cubes form a 5x5 grid, but the inner 3x3 is not part of the structure. Wait, no. The structure is a hollow cube, so the front face has a border of 1cm (the thickness). The inner part is hollow, so the front face's small cubes form a frame of 1cm thick around the hollow part. So for each face of the big cube, the number of small cubes on that face is (5x5) - (3x3) = 25-9=16. But since there are 6 faces, but each edge and corner cube is shared between multiple faces. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of small cubes is 5^3 - 3^3 = 98. Each small cube can be categorized based on their position: corner, edge, face, or inner part (but in this case, the inner is hollow). Let me think of each small cube's contribution to the painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think of each small cube in the hollow cube. The outer surface is painted, so any face on the exterior (the big cube's surface) is painted. All other faces (either adjacent to another small cube or to the hollow space) are unpainted. Therefore, the total number of painted faces is exactly the surface area of the big cube, which is 6*(5*5)=150. So the total number of unpainted faces would be the total faces (98*6=588) minus 150, which gives 588-150=438. So answer A.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498. So 438 is an option. Hmm. But I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow part) are considered as part of the small cubes' faces, but they are not painted. So they are part of the unpainted faces. But in the calculation above, subtracting 150 from 588 includes those inner faces. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of another approach. Let's compute the total number of small cube faces that are on the inside (facing the hollow) and add the internal faces between the small cubes.\n\nWait, the inner surface area (the hollow part) is 3x3 per face, so 6 faces gives 54 small cube faces. Each of these is a face of a small cube that is adjacent to the hollow space. Those are unpainted, so they contribute 54 to the unpainted count.\n\nThe other unpainted faces are the ones between the small cubes. Each small cube has adjacent neighbors. The total number of adjacent faces can be calculated as follows: for all small cubes, each face that is adjacent to another small cube would be counted twice (once for each cube). So the total adjacent faces (internal) would be (total cube faces - total exterior faces - total hollow-facing faces)/2 ?\n\nAlternatively, total cube faces: 588.\n\nTotal exterior (painted) faces: 150.\n\nTotal hollow-facing faces: 54.\n\nSo the remaining faces are 588 -150 -54 = 384. These are the faces that are either between small cubes or on the hollow side. Wait, the hollow-facing ones are 54, so subtracted already. So the remaining 384 are the internal faces between cubes. Each internal face is shared between two cubes, so the actual number of internal faces (counted once) would be 384/2 =192. But the question counts all faces (each face of each cube). So for unpainted faces, both the hollow-facing (54) and the internal ones (each face between two cubes is counted once per cube, so total 384). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that are unpainted. So each small cube's face is considered individually. So:\n\nEach small cube's face is either:\n\n- On the exterior (painted): contributes to the 150 total.\n\n- On the hollow side (unpainted): contributes to the 54.\n\n- Adjacent to another small cube (so internal, not painted): each such face is counted as an unpainted face for the cube, but when two cubes are adjacent, each has a face there. So the total of these is the total internal adjacent faces, which is (total cube faces - exterior - hollow-facing)/2 *2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of unpainted faces is (Total faces) - (painted faces) =588 -150 =438. So that would be 438. Which is option A. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the hollow-facing faces are already part of the total. For example, each small cube that is on the inner wall (facing the hollow) has a face that is part of the hollow-facing. So those are included in the total faces. So subtracting the painted (150) gives all the rest (including those hollow-facing) as unpainted. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hollow is not considered part of the cube. Wait, the hollow is empty, so the small cubes only form the outer 1cm thick shell. So the inner surfaces are the ones facing the hollow. So those are indeed part of the small cubes' faces but are not painted. Hence, the total unpainted is indeed 438. So the answer is A.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Let's think of a smaller cube. Let's say a hollow cube of size 3cm, thickness 1cm. So the inner hollow is 1x1x1. The total small cubes would be 3^3 -1^3 =26. Each has 6 faces, so total is 156. The painted faces are the surface of the big cube: 6*(3x3)=54. So unpainted would be 156-54=102. Alternatively, the inner surface area is 6*(1x1)=6, so the inner faces contribute 6. The rest would be internal between the cubes. Let's see: 102 includes all non-painted. Let me compute another way. For example, each cube on the edge or corner would have some faces painted. Maybe in this smaller example, the answer via 156-54=102. Let me see if that makes sense. The inner cube's surface is 6, so those are part of the small cubes' faces. So 6 are inner faces, the rest 102-6=96 are between the small cubes. That seems okay. So that method works.\n\nTherefore, applying to the original problem, the answer should be 438, which is option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes in a hollow cube of size 5cm with 1cm thickness, we start by calculating the total number of small cubes. The hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5cm and an inner dimension of 3cm (since the thickness is 1cm). The total number of small cubes is \\(5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98\\). Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces across all cubes is \\(98 \\times 6 = 588\\).\n\nThe outer surface of the cube is painted. The surface area of the outer cube is \\(6 \\times (5 \\times 5) = 150\\) small cube faces. These 150 faces are painted, so the remaining faces are unpainted. Subtracting the painted faces from the total gives the unpainted faces: \\(588 - 150 = 438\\).\n\nThe hollow inner surfaces (facing the 3cm hollow space) are already included in this calculation because they are part of the small cubes' faces not on the outer surface.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a hollow cube with a size of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm. It's made up of smaller cubes of 1cm each. The question is, when the outer surface is painted, how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted? Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize this hollow cube. A cube of size 5cm would normally be made up of 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes if it's solid. But since it's hollow, the thickness is 1cm. That probably means that the walls of the cube are 1cm thick. So the hollow part inside must be a smaller cube. Let me think. The outer dimensions are 5cm, so the inner dimensions would be 5 - 2*1 = 3cm, right? Because the thickness is on both sides. So the hollow part is 3x3x3. Therefore, the total number of small cubes in the hollow structure would be the total of the solid cube minus the hollow part. Wait, but how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hollow cube is constructed by removing the inner part. The total number of small cubes in the structure would be (5^3) minus (3^3) since the hollow part is 3x3x3. Let me calculate that: 125 - 27 = 98. Wait, but 3x3x3 is 27, so yes. So there are 98 small cubes in total. But maybe I need to approach this differently because the question is about the number of unpainted faces.\n\nWait, the question is about the total number of faces of the small cubes that remain unpainted. The outer surface is painted. So all the small cubes on the surface have their outer faces painted. But the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow part) would not be painted, so those faces would be unpainted.

So each face of the big cube has a layer of 1cm, so each face is a 5x5 square, but the inner part (the 3x3 in the center of each face) is hollow. Wait, no. Wait, the thickness is 1cm, so the hollow part is a cube of 3cm on each side. So the structure has a 5cm outer cube, with the walls 1cm thick, so the inner hollow space is 3cm on each edge.\n\nTherefore, the total number of small cubes is indeed 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98. So there are 98 small cubes in total. Each small cube has 6 faces. So the total number of faces of all small cubes is 98 * 6 = 588. But some of these are painted, others not. The question is asking for the unpainted ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the total number of unpainted faces. So first, calculate the total faces, then subtract the painted ones. Alternatively, calculate the unpainted directly.\n\nThe outer surface is painted. So any face of a small cube that is on the outside of the big cube is painted. But the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow part) are not painted. Also, the faces between two small cubes (i.e., internal to the structure) are not painted either.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the outer surface is painted. So any face on the outside (i.e., part of the big cube's surface) is painted, and the rest are not. So the unpainted faces include the inner faces (facing the hollow part) and the faces between small cubes (adjacent ones). But perhaps the problem is only considering the inner faces? Or maybe not. Wait, the question is asking how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. So all the faces that are not on the outer surface are unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be (Total faces of all small cubes) minus (Total painted faces).\n\nSo first, total faces: 98 *6 = 588.\n\nTotal painted faces: the outer surface area of the big cube. Since the big cube is 5cm, each face is 5x5 =25, and there are 6 faces, so 25*6=150. But wait, each face of the big cube is made up of small cubes' faces. So the total painted faces would be exactly the surface area of the big cube in terms of small cube faces. Since each face of the big cube is 5x5 small faces, so yes, 25 per face, 6 faces gives 150. So the total painted is 150. So the unpainted would be 588-150=438? Wait, but that would be answer A) 438. But wait, I need to check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. The structure is hollow. So the outer surface is painted, but the inner surfaces (the hollow parts) are not part of the structure. Wait, the inner surfaces are part of the small cubes. For example, the small cubes that are on the edges of the hollow part would have faces adjacent to the hollow space, which are not painted. So those faces are part of the small cubes but not painted. So the painted faces are only those on the outside, but the inner walls (if any) would also be part of the structure but not painted.

The remaining faces are either on the inner surfaces (facing the hollow part) or between the small cubes (adjacent ones, so internal). Those are unpainted.\n\nWait, but how do I calculate the total unpainted faces? Alternatively, the total painted is 150, so unpainted is 588-150 =438, which would be option A.

So answer A?\n\nBut wait, I remember sometimes in these problems, the hollow parts contribute to the inner faces. Let me think again. Let's take an example of a smaller cube. Suppose the cube is 3cm with 1cm thickness. Then the inner hollow would be 1cm, so total cubes would be 27-1=26.

Let me think again.\n\nAnother approach: the total number of unpainted faces is equal to the inner surface area plus the internal faces between the small cubes. Wait, but perhaps it's easier to think of each small cube and count their unpainted faces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of unpainted faces can be calculated by subtracting the painted faces (150) from the total faces (588), but that gives 438, which is option A. However, I should check if there's another way this could be wrong.\n\nWait, but perhaps the inner surfaces (those facing the hollow part) are part of the small cubes. For example, each face on the inside (towards the hollow) of the hollow cube's walls would be an unpainted face. So how many of those are there?\n\nThe inner surface area would be the surface area of the hollow cube's inner walls. Since the inner dimensions are 3x3x3, the inner surface area would be 3x3x6 (since each face of the inner hollow is 3x3, but actually, the inner surface is the inside of the walls). Wait, no. The hollow is a 3cm cube, so the inner surface area of the structure would be the surface area of that 3cm cube. Because the walls are 1cm thick. So each face of the hollow's inner cube is a 3x3 square, and there are 6 faces. So the inner surface area would be 3x3x6 =54 small cube faces. Each of these corresponds to a face of a small cube that is adjacent to the hollow space. These are also unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be the inner surface area (54) plus the internal faces between the small cubes (the ones not on the outer surface or inner surface).\n\nWait, but maybe I need to consider that the total number of faces is 588. The painted ones are the outer surface (150), and the inner surface (54) are also unpainted. But also, the small cubes have adjacent faces which are internal (not on the outer or inner surface). So total unpainted would be (588 - 150) because all except the outer painted ones are unpainted. The inner surface is part of that calculation. So maybe the first approach was right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner surface is part of the small cubes. Let me see. Let me take an example of a single wall. Let's think of the front face of the big cube. The front face is 5x5 small cubes. The hollow is 3cm, so the inner part of the front face is a 3x3 square that is hollow. So the front face's small cubes form a 5x5 grid, but the inner 3x3 is not part of the structure. Wait, no. The structure is a hollow cube, so the front face has a border of 1cm (the thickness). The inner part is hollow, so the front face's small cubes form a frame of 1cm thick around the hollow part. So for each face of the big cube, the number of small cubes on that face is (5x5) - (3x3) = 25-9=16. But since there are 6 faces, but each edge and corner cube is shared between multiple faces. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of small cubes is 5^3 - 3^3 = 98. Each small cube can be categorized based on their position: corner, edge, face, or inner part (but in this case, the inner is hollow). Let me think of each small cube's contribution to the painted faces.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think of each small cube in the hollow cube. The outer surface is painted, so any face on the exterior (the big cube's surface) is painted. All other faces (either adjacent to another small cube or to the hollow space) are unpainted. Therefore, the total number of painted faces is exactly the surface area of the big cube, which is 6*(5*5)=150. So the total number of unpainted faces would be the total faces (98*6=588) minus 150, which gives 588-150=438. So answer A.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498. So 438 is an option. Hmm. But I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow part) are considered as part of the small cubes' faces, but they are not painted. So they are part of the unpainted faces. But in the calculation above, subtracting 150 from 588 includes those inner faces. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think of another approach. Let's compute the total number of small cube faces that are on the inside (facing the hollow) and add the internal faces between the small cubes.\n\nWait, the inner surface area (the hollow part) is 3x3 per face, so 6 faces gives 54 small cube faces. Each of these is a face of a small cube that is adjacent to the hollow space. Those are unpainted, so they contribute 54 to the unpainted count.\n\nThe other unpainted faces are the ones between the small cubes. Each small cube has adjacent neighbors. The total number of adjacent faces can be calculated as follows: for all small cubes, each face that is adjacent to another small cube would be counted twice (once for each cube). So the total adjacent faces (internal) would be (total cube faces - total exterior faces - total hollow-facing faces)/2 ?\n\nAlternatively, total cube faces: 588.\n\nTotal exterior (painted) faces: 150.\n\nTotal hollow-facing faces: 54.\n\nSo the remaining faces are 588 -150 -54 = 384. These are the faces that are either between small cubes or on the hollow side. Wait, the hollow-facing ones are 54, so subtracted already. So the remaining 384 are the internal faces between cubes. Each internal face is shared between two cubes, so the actual number of internal faces (counted once) would be 384/2 =192. But the question counts all faces (each face of each cube). So for unpainted faces, both the hollow-facing (54) and the internal ones (each face between two cubes is counted once per cube, so total 384). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that are unpainted. So each small cube's face is considered individually. So:\n\nEach small cube's face is either:\n\n- On the exterior (painted): contributes to the 150 total.\n\n- On the hollow side (unpainted): contributes to the 54.\n\n- Adjacent to another small cube (so internal, not painted): each such face is counted as an unpainted face for the cube, but when two cubes are adjacent, each has a face there. So the total of these is the total internal adjacent faces, which is (total cube faces - exterior - hollow-facing)/2 *2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of unpainted faces is (Total faces) - (painted faces) =588 -150 =438. So that would be 438. Which is option A. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the hollow-facing faces are already part of the total. For example, each small cube that is on the inner wall (facing the hollow) has a face that is part of the hollow-facing. So those are included in the total faces. So subtracting the painted (150) gives all the rest (including those hollow-facing) as unpainted. So the answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hollow is not considered part of the cube. Wait, the hollow is empty, so the small cubes only form the outer 1cm thick shell. So the inner surfaces are the ones facing the hollow. So those are indeed part of the small cubes' faces but are not painted. Hence, the total unpainted is indeed 438. So the answer is A.\n\nBut let me check with an example. Let's think of a smaller cube. Let's say a hollow cube of size 3cm, thickness 1cm. So the inner hollow is 1x1x1. The total small cubes would be 3^3 -1^3 =26. Each has 6 faces, so total is 156. The painted faces are the surface of the big cube: 6*(3x3)=54. So unpainted would be 156-54=102. Alternatively, the inner surface area is 6*(1x1)=6, so the inner faces contribute 6. The rest would be internal between the cubes. Let's see: 102 includes all non-painted. Let me compute another way. For example, each cube on the edge or corner would have some faces painted. Maybe in this smaller example, the answer via 156-54=102. Let me see if that makes sense. The inner cube's surface is 6, so those are part of the small cubes' faces. So 6 are inner faces, the rest 102-6=96 are between the small cubes. That seems okay. So that method works.\n\nTherefore, applying to the original problem, the answer should be 438, which is option A.\n\n\nTo determine the number of unpainted faces of the smaller cubes in a hollow cube of size 5cm with 1cm thickness, we start by calculating the total number of small cubes. The hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5cm and an inner dimension of 3cm (since the thickness is 1cm). The total number of small cubes is \\(5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98\\). Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces across all cubes is \\(98 \\times 6 = 588\\).\n\nThe outer surface of the cube is painted. The surface area of the outer cube is \\(6 \\times (5 \\times 5) = 150\\) small cube faces. These 150 faces are painted, so the remaining faces are unpainted. Subtracting the painted faces from the total gives the unpainted faces: \\(588 - 150 = 438\\).\n\nThe hollow inner surfaces (facing the 3cm hollow space) are already included in this calculation because they are part of the small cubes' faces not on the outer surface. Thus, the total unpainted faces are indeed \\(588 - 150 = 438\\).\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hollow cube. Let me try to visualize it first. The cube is 5cm in size, which means each edge is 5cm long. But it's hollow with a thickness of 1cm. Hmm, right, so the cube isn't solid. The thickness is 1cm, so the walls of the hollow cube are 1cm thick. The entire structure is made up of smaller cubes, each 1cm in size. The question is asking how many faces of these small cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of small cubes and then how many of their faces are painted or not. Wait, but maybe I should think differently. Since the outer surface is painted, all the outer faces of the big cube's surfaces are painted. The inner parts, which are hollow, aren't painted. So the unpainted faces would be those that are on the inside of the hollow part, plus any faces that are adjacent to other cubes (so they are covered by another cube's face, hence not exposed). \n\nLet me break it down. The big cube is 5cm on each edge. Since it's hollow with 1cm thickness, the inner hollow part must be a smaller cube. The thickness is 1cm, so the inner cube's edge length would be 5 - 2*1 = 3cm. Because the thickness is on both sides. So the hollow part is 3x3x3. \n\nSo the structure is like a 5cm cube with a 3cm cube hollowed out from the center. Each face of the big cube has a thickness of 1cm, so the walls are 1cm thick. \n\nNow, the total number of small cubes in the structure. The entire big cube would have 5x5x5=125 small cubes. But since it's hollow, we subtract the inner hollow part. The inner hollow part is a 3x3x3 cube, which is 27 cubes. So total small cubes used are 125-27=98. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the thickness here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, the hollow cube's walls are 1cm thick, so the volume would be the volume of the outer cube minus the inner hollow space. So the outer cube is 5^3 = 125. The hollow part is (5 - 2*1)^3 = 3^3=27. So the volume of the material is 125-27=98 cm\u00b3. Since each small cube is 1cm\u00b3, that's 98 small cubes. So that's correct. \n\nBut the question isn't about the number of small cubes, but the number of their faces that are unpainted. Hmm. \n\nEach small cube can have up to 6 faces. The outer surfaces of the big cube are painted, so any face of a small cube that's on the exterior is painted. The inner faces (those inside the hollow part) are unpainted. Also, any face that's adjacent to another small cube (even if that cube is part of the structure) would not be exposed and thus unpainted. Wait, but actually, when the outer surface is painted, only the outer faces (those on the surface of the big cube) are painted. The inner faces (like the ones in the hollow) and the ones between the small cubes (which are internal) are not painted. \n\nWait, but actually, the cubes that are on the surface of the big cube will have their outer faces painted. The ones inside the walls (but not on the inner hollow) will have some faces adjacent to other cubes and some on the inside (the hollow) which are unpainted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the total number of painted faces and subtract from the total possible faces to get the unpainted ones. \n\nLet me think of the total number of small cube faces. Each small cube has 6 faces, so total faces for all small cubes would be 98 * 6 = 588. But this counts all faces, including those glued to adjacent cubes. However, the actual number of exposed faces (which would be painted) plus the inner faces (unpainted) equals this total. Wait, but actually, the total number of faces (including internal ones) is 588. But the problem is asking for how many of the faces are unpainted. The painted ones are exactly the outer surfaces of the big cube. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the number of painted faces first. The outer surface of the big cube is a cube of 5cm. Each face of the big cube is a 5x5 square, so each face has 25 small faces. There are 6 faces, so total painted faces are 6*25=150. So the total number of painted small cube faces is 150. \n\nTherefore, the unpainted faces would be total small cube faces (588) minus the painted ones (150), which would be 588-150=438? But wait, but wait, this might not be correct because some of the small cube's faces are adjacent to other cubes and thus not exposed, so they are not painted, but also not part of the outer surface. So the total number of faces that are unpainted would indeed be the total faces minus the painted ones. \n\nWait, but the total number of small cube faces is indeed 98 *6 = 588. The painted ones are exactly the 150 (from the outer surface). So the unpainted would be 588-150 = 438. Which is option A. But wait, the options have A as 438, so that's possible. But let me check again because sometimes there's a mistake in considering overlaps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of small cube faces that are unpainted, but not counting the internal ones between the cubes. Wait, no, the problem says \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted\". So any face of a small cube that is not on the outer surface (so either inside the hollow or between two cubes) is unpainted. So the total is indeed all faces except the ones on the outer surface. \n\nSo the total small cube faces: 98 *6 = 588. The outer surface has 6 faces of the big cube, each 5x5 = 25. So 6*25=150. So unpainted is 588-150=438. That would be option A. But wait, the options given include A)438 and E)498. Wait, but let me think again. \n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total number of small cubes. Let me check that again. The big cube is 5x5x5 =125. The hollow part is 3x3x3=27. So the material is 125-27=98 small cubes. That's correct. So 98*6=588 total faces. \n\nThe outer surface's painted area is 6*(5*5)=150. So 588-150=438. So the answer would be A. But let me see the options again. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498. So 438 is an option. \n\nWait, but I might be missing something. Let me think differently. The problem says the cube is hollow with thickness 1cm. So maybe the inner hollow is not 3x3x3? Let me recalculate. The thickness is 1cm, so the hollow part would be 5 - 2*1 = 3 cm on each edge. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts the inner faces (the ones facing the hollow part) as unpainted. So each face of the hollow walls has a face that's part of the hollow. For instance, the inner surfaces of the cube walls (the ones facing the hollow) are unpainted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to compute the number of small cube faces that are on the inside (hollow) or between other cubes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my first approach is correct, but let's see another way. \n\nAlternatively, for each face of the big cube, the outer face is painted, so each of those 25 small cubes on that face have one face painted. But each small cube on the edge or corner would have multiple faces painted, but the total count of painted small faces is indeed 6*(5*5)=150, which is correct. \n\nHmm, so if that's the case, then the answer is A)438. But why is there an option E as 498? Maybe I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes. Let me check again. \n\nWait, perhaps the hollow cube is structured differently. Suppose the thickness is 1cm, so the hollow is not a cube. Wait, a cube's thickness being 1cm would mean that each face is 1cm thick. So the inner hollow would be 5-2*1=3 cm on each side, so a 3x3x3 cube. So subtracting that from the big cube's volume gives the correct number of small cubes. \n\nWait another thought: maybe the problem is considering that the small cubes on the edges and corners have some of their faces painted, but the total painted faces are indeed 150. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of small cubes that have unpainted faces, not the total unpainted faces. Wait, no, the question says \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted\", so it's the total count of faces. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the total number of small cubes. Let me check again. The big cube is 5x5x5=125. The hollow part is 3x3x3=27. So 125-27=98. That's correct. So 98 small cubes. \n\nSo the total small cube faces are 98x6 = 588. \n\nThe painted ones are the outer surface, which is 6*(5x5)=150. \n\nSubtract: 588-150=438. So the answer is A. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the hollow part's inner surfaces are also painted? No, the problem says only the outer surface is painted. So the inner surfaces of the hollow are unpainted. \n\nWait, but the inner surfaces would be part of the small cubes' faces. So each face of the small cubes that is part of the inner walls (facing the hollow) is also unpainted. Wait, but in the calculation above, those inner faces are already accounted for in the total. Let me see. \n\nThe total number of all small cube faces is 588. The only painted ones are the 150 on the outer surface. All other faces (the ones between small cubes and those on the inner hollow) are unpainted. So yes, 588-150=438. \n\nHmm. So that would be option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes. Let me think again. \n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider each face of the big cube. Each face has 5x5=25 small cube faces painted. So total painted faces are 6*25=150. \n\nNow, each small cube on the surface of the big cube will have some faces painted. But the question is asking for the total number of unpainted faces across all small cubes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the number of small cubes that have at least one unpainted face. But no, the question is about the total number of faces. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my mistake is in the calculation of the total number of small cubes. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the hollow cube's structure is not as I thought. Let me think of the cube as a 5x5x5 cube with each face having a 1cm thick wall. The hollow part would be a 3x3x3 cube in the center. So the walls are 1cm thick. \n\nBut let me calculate the number of small cubes in the walls. For each face of the cube, the wall has a thickness of 1. The front face is a 5x5 square, but the inner part (the hollow) would have a 3x3 square missing from the center? Wait, no. Actually, each face's wall is 1cm thick. So the entire structure's walls form a hollow cube. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of small cubes can be calculated as follows. The total for each face's wall (but considering overlaps on edges and corners). Hmm, this might be more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of small cubes is indeed 5\u00b3 - 3\u00b3 = 98. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts the inner faces as part of the cube's internal structure. So for example, the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow) are also part of the small cubes, but they are not painted. \n\nBut in the total faces of all small cubes, all those inner faces (both between cubes and inside the hollow) are indeed counted. So the initial calculation holds. \n\nHmm. So the answer would be 438, which is option A. But let me check the options again. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes. Let me try another approach. Let's think of each face of the cube. \n\nThe cube has 6 faces. Each face is a 5x5 grid of small cubes, but since it's hollow, the inner part is removed. Wait, but the thickness is 1cm, so each face's wall is 1cm thick. \n\nThe front face (for example) has a 5x5 grid. The hollow would mean that the inner part is not there. Wait, no. The hollow is a cube. So each face's wall is 1cm thick. \n\nAlternatively, the number of small cubes in each face's wall (excluding the edges and corners which are shared with other faces). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of cubes on each face: each face has a perimeter of 5x5, but subtract the inner 3x3? Wait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, each face's wall is a 5x5 square, but the inner part is hollow. Wait, no. The walls are 1cm thick, so the entire face's wall is 1cm thick, so each face's wall is a 5x5x1 block. But since it's a cube, the walls are on all six sides. \n\nWait, perhaps the total volume is calculated as follows: The entire cube is 5x5x5. The hollow part is a cube of 3x3x3. So subtract that from the total. \n\nSo 5\u00b3 - 3\u00b3 = 125 -27 = 98. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Then my initial calculation holds. \n\nWait, but another way: the total number of small cubes in the structure is 98. Each has 6 faces. So 98 *6 = 588. \n\nThe total painted faces are the outer surfaces. Each face of the big cube is 5x5=25, so 6 faces give 150. \n\nSo the unpainted faces are 588-150=438. So answer A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question counts the inner hollow's faces as painted? But no, the problem says only the outer surface is painted. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to check if the inner surfaces are considered part of the small cubes' faces. For instance, the hollow's inner walls are part of the small cubes' faces. So each face of the hollow is part of a small cube's face. \n\nFor example, the hollow is a 3x3x3 cube. So each face of the hollow has 3x3=9 small cube faces on each side. There are 6 faces on the hollow, so 6*9=54. But these are the inner faces of the structure, which are not painted. However, these faces are part of the small cubes' faces. \n\nWait, but in the total of 588, those inner faces are counted. So when we subtract the 150 painted, those inner hollow faces are part of the 438 unpainted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps the inner hollow's faces are actually part of the small cubes' faces. For example, the cubes on the inner surfaces (facing the hollow) have their faces on that side unpainted, yes. But those are included in the total. \n\nWait, the calculation seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the hollow is not 3x3x3. Let me think again. \n\nThe thickness is 1cm, so from each face, the wall is 1cm inward. So in each dimension, the outer dimension is 5cm. The inner dimension would be 5 - 2*1 =3cm. So the hollow is 3cm in each dimension. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. I think my calculation is correct, so the answer should be A)438. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes. Let me check again. \n\nTotal volume of big cube:5\u00d75\u00d75=125. Volume of hollow part:3\u00d73\u00d73=27. So 125\u221227=98. So yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of small cubes that have unpainted faces. Wait, no, the question is about the total number of faces. \n\nHmm. I think I'm confident with the calculation. The answer should be A)438. \n\nWait, but let me think of an example with a smaller cube to see if this approach works. Let's say a hollow cube of size 3cm with thickness 1cm. Then the inner hollow would be 1cm. \n\nTotal small cubes: 3^3 -1^3 =27-1=26. Total faces: 26\u00d76=156. \n\nPainted faces: outer surface. Each face of big cube is 3x3=9, so 6\u00d79=54. \n\nUnpainted faces: 156-54=102. \n\nAlternatively, let's count manually. For a 3x3x3 hollow cube (thickness 1), the structure is a cube with walls 1cm thick. Each face has 9 small cubes, but the center is hollow. \n\nThe total small cubes: each face has a 3x3, but subtract the overlapping edges. Wait, maybe in this case, the total is 26. \n\nThe inner hollow is 1x1x1, so subtract that. \n\nThe total unpainted faces would be the inner surfaces (each face of the hollow has 1 face per cube, but the hollow has 6 faces each 1x1, so 6*1=6. But each of those is a face of the surrounding cubes. \n\nBut according to the formula, total unpainted is 156-54=102. \n\nAlternatively, let's see: each of the 26 small cubes. \n\nThe corner cubes of the big cube (there are 8 corners) each are part of three outer faces. Each corner cube has three painted faces and the other three faces. The other three faces may be adjacent to other cubes or part of the hollow. \n\nWait, in the 3cm case, the hollow is 1cm. So the corner cubes are on the outside, their inner faces (the ones towards the hollow) would be adjacent to nothing. So each corner cube has three outer faces (painted) and three inner faces (unpainted). \n\nSo each corner cube contributes 3 unpainted faces. 8 corners \u2192 8\u00d73=24. \n\nEdge cubes (not corners): on each edge of the big cube, there are edges of length 3. Each edge has (3-2)=1 cube that's on the edge but not a corner. Each edge has 1 such cube. There are 12 edges. Each of these edge cubes has two painted faces (on the outer surfaces) and the other four faces. Two of those are adjacent to other cubes (the corners and the next cube along the edge?), and two are part of the hollow? Wait, in the 3cm case, the edge cube between two corners would have two outer faces (on the two adjacent faces of the big cube) and the remaining four faces. The faces towards the center would be part of the hollow. Wait, maybe in this case, each edge cube (non-corner) has two painted faces and four inner faces? \n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. But using the formula, the total unpainted is 102. Let's see: \n\nTotal small cubes:26. Each has 6 faces: 26\u00d76=156. \n\nPainted faces: outer surface is 6 faces of 3x3, so 54. \n\nTotal unpainted is 156-54=102. \n\nIf that's correct, then the formula holds. \n\nSo applying the same logic to the original problem gives 438. Which would be answer A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A)438.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hollow cube. Let me try to visualize it first. The cube is 5cm in size, which means each edge is 5cm long. But it's hollow with a thickness of 1cm. Hmm, right, so the cube isn't solid. The thickness is 1cm, so the walls of the hollow cube are 1cm thick. The entire structure is made up of smaller cubes, each 1cm in size. The question is asking how many faces of these small cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out the total number of small cubes and then how many of their faces are painted or not. Wait, but maybe I should think differently. Since the outer surface is painted, all the outer faces of the big cube's surfaces are painted. The inner parts, which are hollow, aren't painted. So the unpainted faces would be those that are on the inside of the hollow part, plus any faces that are adjacent to other cubes (so they are covered by another cube's face, hence not exposed). \n\nLet me break it down. The big cube is 5cm on each edge. Since it's hollow with 1cm thickness, the inner hollow part must be a smaller cube. The thickness is 1cm, so the inner cube's edge length would be 5 - 2*1 = 3cm. Because the thickness is on both sides. So the hollow part is 3x3x3. \n\nSo the structure is like a 5cm cube with a 3cm cube hollowed out from the center. Each face of the big cube has a thickness of 1cm, so the walls are 1cm thick. \n\nNow, the total number of small cubes in the structure. The entire big cube would have 5x5x5=125 small cubes. But since it's hollow, we subtract the inner hollow part. The inner hollow part is a 3x3x3 cube, which is 27 cubes. So total small cubes used are 125-27=98. Wait, but wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the thickness here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, the hollow cube's walls are 1cm thick, so the volume would be the volume of the outer cube minus the inner hollow space. So the outer cube is 5^3 = 125. The hollow part is (5 - 2*1)^3 = 3^3=27. So the volume of the material is 125-27=98 cm\u00b3. Since each small cube is 1cm\u00b3, that's 98 small cubes. So that's correct. \n\nBut the question isn't about the number of small cubes, but the number of their faces that are unpainted. Hmm. \n\nEach small cube can have up to 6 faces. The outer surfaces of the big cube are painted, so any face of a small cube that's on the exterior is painted. The inner faces (those inside the hollow part) are unpainted. Also, any face that's adjacent to another small cube (even if that cube is part of the structure) would not be exposed and thus unpainted. Wait, but actually, when the outer surface is painted, only the outer faces (those on the surface of the big cube) are painted. The inner faces (like the ones in the hollow) and the ones between the small cubes (which are internal) are not painted. \n\nWait, but actually, the cubes that are on the surface of the big cube will have their outer faces painted. The ones inside the walls (but not on the inner hollow) will have some faces adjacent to other cubes and some on the inside (the hollow) which are unpainted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the total number of painted faces and subtract from the total possible faces to get the unpainted ones. \n\nLet me think of the total number of small cube faces. Each small cube has 6 faces, so total faces for all small cubes would be 98 * 6 = 588. But this counts all faces, including those glued to adjacent cubes. However, the actual number of exposed faces (which would be painted) plus the inner faces (unpainted) equals this total. Wait, but actually, the total number of faces (including internal ones) is 588. But the problem is asking for how many of the faces are unpainted. The painted ones are exactly the outer surfaces of the big cube. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the number of painted faces first. The outer surface of the big cube is a cube of 5cm. Each face of the big cube is a 5x5 square, so each face has 25 small faces. There are 6 faces, so total painted faces are 6*25=150. So the total number of painted small cube faces is 150. \n\nTherefore, the unpainted faces would be total small cube faces (588) minus the painted ones (150), which would be 588-150=438? But wait, but wait, this might not be correct because some of the small cube's faces are adjacent to other cubes and thus not exposed, so they are not painted, but also not part of the outer surface. So the total number of faces that are unpainted would indeed be the total faces minus the painted ones. \n\nWait, but the total number of small cube faces is indeed 98 *6 = 588. The painted ones are exactly the 150 (from the outer surface). So the unpainted would be 588-150 = 438. Which is option A. But wait, the options have A as 438, so that's possible. But let me check again because sometimes there's a mistake in considering overlaps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the number of small cube faces that are unpainted, but not counting the internal ones between the cubes. Wait, no, the problem says \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted\". So any face of a small cube that is not on the outer surface (so either inside the hollow or between two cubes) is unpainted. So the total is indeed all faces except the ones on the outer surface. \n\nSo the total small cube faces: 98 *6 = 588. The outer surface has 6 faces of the big cube, each 5x5 = 25. So 6*25=150. So unpainted is 588-150=438. That would be option A. But wait, the options given include A)438 and E)498. Wait, but let me think again. \n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the total number of small cubes. Let me check that again. The big cube is 5x5x5 =125. The hollow part is 3x3x3=27. So the material is 125-27=98 small cubes. That's correct. So 98*6=588 total faces. \n\nThe outer surface's painted area is 6*(5*5)=150. So 588-150=438. So the answer would be A. But let me see the options again. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498. So 438 is an option. \n\nWait, but I might be missing something. Let me think differently. The problem says the cube is hollow with thickness 1cm. So maybe the inner hollow is not 3x3x3? Let me recalculate. The thickness is 1cm, so the hollow part would be 5 - 2*1 = 3 cm on each edge. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem counts the inner faces (the ones facing the hollow part) as unpainted. So each face of the hollow walls has a face that's part of the hollow. For instance, the inner surfaces of the cube walls (the ones facing the hollow) are unpainted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to compute the number of small cube faces that are on the inside (hollow) or between other cubes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my first approach is correct, but let's see another way. \n\nAlternatively, for each face of the big cube, the outer face is painted, so each of those 25 small cubes on that face have one face painted. But each small cube on the edge or corner would have multiple faces painted, but the total count of painted small faces is indeed 6*(5*5)=150, which is correct. \n\nHmm, so if that's the case, then the answer is A)438. But why is there an option E as 498? Maybe I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes. Let me check again. \n\nWait, perhaps the hollow cube is structured differently. Suppose the thickness is 1cm, so the hollow is not a cube. Wait, a cube's thickness being 1cm would mean that each face is 1cm thick. So the inner hollow would be 5-2*1=3 cm on each side, so a 3x3x3 cube. So subtracting that from the big cube's volume gives the correct number of small cubes. \n\nWait another thought: maybe the problem is considering that the small cubes on the edges and corners have some of their faces painted, but the total painted faces are indeed 150. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the number of small cubes that have unpainted faces, not the total unpainted faces. Wait, no, the question says \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted\", so it's the total count of faces. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the total number of small cubes. Let me check again. The big cube is 5x5x5=125. The hollow part is 3x3x3=27. So 125-27=98. That's correct. So 98 small cubes. \n\nSo the total small cube faces are 98x6 = 588. \n\nThe painted ones are the outer surface, which is 6*(5x5)=150. \n\nSubtract: 588-150=438. So the answer is A. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the hollow part's inner surfaces are also painted? No, the problem says only the outer surface is painted. So the inner surfaces of the hollow are unpainted. \n\nWait, but the inner surfaces would be part of the small cubes' faces. So each face of the small cubes that is part of the inner walls (facing the hollow) is also unpainted. Wait, but in the calculation above, those inner faces are already accounted for in the total. Let me see. \n\nThe total number of all small cube faces is 588. The only painted ones are the 150 on the outer surface. All other faces (the ones between small cubes and those on the inner hollow) are unpainted. So yes, 588-150=438. \n\nHmm. So that would be option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes. Let me think again. \n\nWait, another approach: Let's consider each face of the big cube. Each face has 5x5=25 small cube faces painted. So total painted faces are 6*25=150. \n\nNow, each small cube on the surface of the big cube will have some faces painted. But the question is asking for the total number of unpainted faces across all small cubes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the number of small cubes that have at least one unpainted face. But no, the question is about the total number of faces. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my mistake is in the calculation of the total number of small cubes. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the hollow cube's structure is not as I thought. Let me think of the cube as a 5x5x5 cube with each face having a 1cm thick wall. The hollow part would be a 3x3x3 cube in the center. So the walls are 1cm thick. \n\nBut let me calculate the number of small cubes in the walls. For each face of the cube, the wall has a thickness of 1. The front face is a 5x5 square, but the inner part (the hollow) would have a 3x3 square missing from the center? Wait, no. Actually, each face's wall is 1cm thick. So the entire structure's walls form a hollow cube. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of small cubes can be calculated as follows. The total for each face's wall (but considering overlaps on edges and corners). Hmm, this might be more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of small cubes is indeed 5\u00b3 - 3\u00b3 = 98. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts the inner faces as part of the cube's internal structure. So for example, the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow) are also part of the small cubes, but they are not painted. \n\nBut in the total faces of all small cubes, all those inner faces (both between cubes and inside the hollow) are indeed counted. So the initial calculation holds. \n\nHmm. So the answer would be 438, which is option A. But let me check the options again. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes. Let me try another approach. Let's think of each face of the cube. \n\nThe cube has 6 faces. Each face is a 5x5 grid of small cubes, but since it's hollow, the inner part is removed. Wait, but the thickness is 1cm, so each face's wall is 1cm thick. \n\nThe front face (for example) has a 5x5 grid. The hollow would mean that the inner part is not there. Wait, no. The hollow is a cube. So each face's wall is 1cm thick. \n\nAlternatively, the number of small cubes in each face's wall (excluding the edges and corners which are shared with other faces). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of cubes on each face: each face has a perimeter of 5x5, but subtract the inner 3x3? Wait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, each face's wall is a 5x5 square, but the inner part is hollow. Wait, no. The walls are 1cm thick, so the entire face's wall is 1cm thick, so each face's wall is a 5x5x1 block. But since it's a cube, the walls are on all six sides. \n\nWait, perhaps the total volume is calculated as follows: The entire cube is 5x5x5. The hollow part is a cube of 3x3x3. So subtract that from the total. \n\nSo 5\u00b3 - 3\u00b3 = 125 -27 = 98. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Then my initial calculation holds. \n\nWait, but another way: the total number of small cubes in the structure is 98. Each has 6 faces. So 98 *6 = 588. \n\nThe total painted faces are the outer surfaces. Each face of the big cube is 5x5=25, so 6 faces give 150. \n\nSo the unpainted faces are 588-150=438. So answer A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question counts the inner hollow's faces as painted? But no, the problem says only the outer surface is painted. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to check if the inner surfaces are considered part of the small cubes' faces. For instance, the hollow's inner walls are part of the small cubes' faces. So each face of the hollow is part of a small cube's face. \n\nFor example, the hollow is a 3x3x3 cube. So each face of the hollow has 3x3=9 small cube faces on each side. There are 6 faces on the hollow, so 6*9=54. But these are the inner faces of the structure, which are not painted. However, these faces are part of the small cubes' faces. \n\nWait, but in the total of 588, those inner faces are counted. So when we subtract the 150 painted, those inner hollow faces are part of the 438 unpainted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps the inner hollow's faces are actually part of the small cubes' faces. For example, the cubes on the inner surfaces (facing the hollow) have their faces on that side unpainted, yes. But those are included in the total. \n\nWait, the calculation seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the hollow is not 3x3x3. Let me think again. \n\nThe thickness is 1cm, so from each face, the wall is 1cm inward. So in each dimension, the outer dimension is 5cm. The inner dimension would be 5 - 2*1 =3cm. So the hollow is 3cm in each dimension. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. I think my calculation is correct, so the answer should be A)438. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes. Let me check again. \n\nTotal volume of big cube:5\u00d75\u00d75=125. Volume of hollow part:3\u00d73\u00d73=27. So 125\u221227=98. So yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of small cubes that have unpainted faces. Wait, no, the question is about the total number of faces. \n\nHmm. I think I'm confident with the calculation. The answer should be A)438. \n\nWait, but let me think of an example with a smaller cube to see if this approach works. Let's say a hollow cube of size 3cm with thickness 1cm. Then the inner hollow would be 1cm. \n\nTotal small cubes: 3^3 -1^3 =27-1=26. Total faces: 26\u00d76=156. \n\nPainted faces: outer surface. Each face of big cube is 3x3=9, so 6\u00d79=54. \n\nUnpainted faces: 156-54=102. \n\nAlternatively, let's count manually. For a 3x3x3 hollow cube (thickness 1), the structure is a cube with walls 1cm thick. Each face has 9 small cubes, but the center is hollow. \n\nThe total small cubes: each face has a 3x3, but subtract the overlapping edges. Wait, maybe in this case, the total is 26. \n\nThe inner hollow is 1x1x1, so subtract that. \n\nThe total unpainted faces would be the inner surfaces (each face of the hollow has 1 face per cube, but the hollow has 6 faces each 1x1, so 6*1=6. But each of those is a face of the surrounding cubes. \n\nBut according to the formula, total unpainted is 156-54=102. \n\nAlternatively, let's see: each of the 26 small cubes. \n\nThe corner cubes of the big cube (there are 8 corners) each are part of three outer faces. Each corner cube has three painted faces and the other three faces. The other three faces may be adjacent to other cubes or part of the hollow. \n\nWait, in the 3cm case, the hollow is 1cm. So the corner cubes are on the outside, their inner faces (the ones towards the hollow) would be adjacent to nothing. So each corner cube has three outer faces (painted) and three inner faces (unpainted). \n\nSo each corner cube contributes 3 unpainted faces. 8 corners \u2192 8\u00d73=24. \n\nEdge cubes (not corners): on each edge of the big cube, there are edges of length 3. Each edge has (3-2)=1 cube that's on the edge but not a corner. Each edge has 1 such cube. There are 12 edges. Each of these edge cubes has two painted faces (on the outer surfaces) and the other four faces. Two of those are adjacent to other cubes (the corners and the next cube along the edge?), and two are part of the hollow? Wait, in the 3cm case, the edge cube between two corners would have two outer faces (on the two adjacent faces of the big cube) and the remaining four faces. The faces towards the center would be part of the hollow. Wait, maybe in this case, each edge cube (non-corner) has two painted faces and four inner faces? \n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. But using the formula, the total unpainted is 102. Let's see: \n\nTotal small cubes:26. Each has 6 faces: 26\u00d76=156. \n\nPainted faces: outer surface is 6 faces of 3x3, so 54. \n\nTotal unpainted is 156-54=102. \n\nIf that's correct, then the formula holds. \n\nSo applying the same logic to the original problem gives 438. Which would be answer A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A)438.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by determining the dimensions and structure of the hollow cube. The outer cube has a size of 5 cm, and the thickness of its walls is 1 cm. The inner hollow space is therefore a cube with edge length \\(5 - 2 \\times 1 = 3\\) cm. \n\n**Total number of small cubes in the structure**:  \nThe volume of the outer cube is \\(5^3 = 125\\) cm\u00b3. The volume of the hollow inner cube is \\(3^3 = 27\\) cm\u00b3. Subtracting the hollow volume from the outer volume gives the material volume:  \n\\[\n125 - 27 = 98 \\text{ small cubes}.\n\\]\n\n**Total number of faces of all small cubes**:  \nEach small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces is:  \n\\[\n98 \\times 6 = 588.\n\\]\n\n**Number of painted faces**:  \nThe outer surface of the cube has 6 faces, each of size \\(5 \\times 5\\). Thus, the total painted faces are:  \n\\[\n6 \\times (5 \\times 5) = 6 \\times 25 = 150.\n\\]\n\n**Number of unpainted faces**:  \nSubtracting the painted faces from the total faces gives the unpainted faces:  \n\\[\n588 - 150 = 438.\n\\]\n\nThis matches option **A**.
