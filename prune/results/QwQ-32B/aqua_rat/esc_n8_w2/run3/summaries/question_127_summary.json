      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about mixing two alloys, X and Y, to form alloy Z. The question is asking for the ratio of zinc to copper in the new alloy Z. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the ratios given for each alloy. Alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. Wait, that simplifies maybe? Let me see. 6:9 can be divided by 3, so that's 2:3. But maybe I don't need to simplify right away. The problem states the original ratios, so perhaps I should work with those numbers as given. Similarly, alloy Y is 7:11 for zinc to copper. \n\nThe problem says they take 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y, melt them together to form Z. I need to find the total amount of zinc and copper in the mixture and then find their ratio.\n\nAlright, so first, for alloy X, which is 40 grams total. The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. Let me think. The total parts for X's ratio are 6 + 9 = 15 parts. So each part is 40 grams divided by 15. Wait, yeah, so each part is 40/15 grams. Then zinc is 6 parts, so zinc in X would be (6/15)*40, and copper is (9/15)*40.\n\nSimilarly for alloy Y, which is 60 grams. Its ratio is 7:11. Total parts here are 7+11=18 parts. Each part is 60/18 grams. So zinc in Y is (7/18)*60 and copper is (11/18)*60.\n\nOnce I calculate the zinc and copper from each alloy, I can add them together to get total zinc and total copper in alloy Z, then form the ratio.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nStarting with Alloy X:\n\nZinc in X: (6/15)*40. Let's compute that. 6 divided by 15 is 0.4. 0.4 times 40 is 16 grams of zinc. Wait, let me do it fraction-wise to be precise. 6/15 simplifies to 2/5. So 2/5 *40 = (2*40)/5 = 80/5 = 16. That's correct. So zinc from X is 16g.\n\nCopper in X: 9/15 of 40. 9/15 is 3/5. 3/5 *40 = 24 grams. So copper from X is 24g.\n\nNow Alloy Y:\n\nTotal parts 18. Zinc is 7 parts. So 7/18 of 60g.\n\n7 divided by 18 multiplied by 60. Let's see, 60 divided by 18 is 10/3, so 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u2248 23.333... grams. Let me write that as a fraction: 70/3 grams of zinc from Y.\n\nCopper in Y is 11 parts. So 11/18 *60. 11*(60/18) = 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u2248 36.666... grams. So copper from Y is 110/3 grams.\n\nNow, total zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 70/3. Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3 grams of zinc.\n\nTotal copper is 24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3 = 182/3 grams of copper.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Copper from X is 24 grams, which is 24/1, so to add to 110/3, I need common denominators. 24 is 72/3, so adding to 110/3 gives (72+110)/3 = 182/3. Yes.\n\nSo now the total zinc is 118/3 grams and copper is 182/3 grams. \n\nThe ratio of zinc to copper is (118/3) : (182/3). Since the denominators are the same, they cancel out, so it's 118 : 182. Now, I need to simplify this ratio.\n\nLet me see if 118 and 182 have a common divisor. Let's check 2 first. 118 divided by 2 is 59, 182 divided by 2 is 91. So dividing both by 2 gives 59:91. \n\nHmm, looking at the options, option D is 59:91. Let me check the options again. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91 (Wait, maybe I misread. Wait the options given in the problem: the user listed options as A to E, and D is written as \"D)59:91\" which is same as B? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the user's options are:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, hold on, that can't be right. Wait, the user must have a typo here. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back, the user wrote:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nWait, so B and D are both 59:91. That's a problem. But maybe it's a mistake in the problem's options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again step by step. Maybe I miscalculated somewhere.\n\nStarting with Alloy X: 40g. Ratio 6:9 (zinc:copper). Total parts 15. \n\nZinc: 6/15 of 40. 6/15 *40 = (6*40)/15 = 240/15 = 16g. Correct.\n\nCopper: 9/15 *40 = (9*40)/15 = 360/15 =24g. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y: 60g, ratio 7:11. Total parts 18.\n\nZinc: 7/18 *60 = (7*60)/18 = 420/18 = 23.333... which is 70/3 \u224823.333. Correct.\n\nCopper: 11/18*60 = (660)/18 = 36.666..., which is 110/3. Correct.\n\nTotal zinc: 16 +70/3. 16 is 48/3, so total 48+70=118 over 3. So 118/3 grams.\n\nTotal copper: 24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3, so 72+110=182, so 182/3. \n\nRatio zinc:copper is 118:182. Divided by 2 gives 59:91. So yes, that's correct. \n\nNow looking at the options again. The problem lists options with B and D as same? That can't be. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo. Let me check again the options as presented.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, that's odd. Maybe D is supposed to be different? Like maybe a typo in the original problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me check once more.\n\nWait, maybe the ratios were read the other way? Wait, the problem says alloy X is zinc to copper 6:9. So yes, that's correct. So 6 parts zinc, 9 copper. \n\nWait, maybe when adding the copper from Y, I made an error?\n\nWait copper in Y is 11 parts. 11/18 *60. Let me calculate 11*60=660, divided by 18: 660/18 = 36.666..., which is 110/3. So that's correct. \n\nAdding to 24 grams (from X's copper):\n\n24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3. 72 +110 = 182. 182/3 is correct. \n\nSo the ratio is 118/3 : 182/3, which simplifies to 118:182. Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 59/91. So the ratio is 59:91. \n\nSo the answer should be B and D, but in the options given, both B and D are 59:91. That can't be. Wait, the user probably made a typo. Let me check the original problem again. \n\nWait the user's options are listed as:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, perhaps D is supposed to be 59:90? Like a typo in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.\n\nWait 118 divided by 2 is 59, 182 divided by 2 is 91. So 59:91 is correct. \n\nLooking at the options, B and D are the same. That's a problem. But maybe in the actual problem, there was a different option. Wait the user's input might have a mistake. Let me see the original problem again.\n\nWait in the problem statement, the options are listed as:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nAh, so both B and D are the same. That's an error. But in the original question, perhaps the user made a typo. Let me check again. Wait maybe I misread the options.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nD)59:91\n\nAh, so perhaps the options are:\n\nB and D are same. So the correct answer is either B or D. But since the problem gives options with letters, and the user probably intended one of them, perhaps it's a typo. Maybe D is supposed to be different, but given the options as presented, the correct answer is 59:91, which is option B and D. Since that's impossible, perhaps there's another mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the ratio. Let me see:\n\nWait, maybe the ratio of alloy Y is 7:11 for zinc to copper. So that's correct. 7 parts zinc, 11 copper. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is mixing up the order? Like, the problem says \"ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z\" so zinc first, copper second. Our answer is 59:91. So the options B and D are same. But the user must have a typo here. Let me check again the problem's options again.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in option D's entry. Like maybe D is supposed to be 59:90, but it's written as 59:91. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 59:90? Let me recheck the math again.\n\nWait let me re-calculate the total zinc and copper.\n\nAlloy X:\n\nZinc: 6 parts /15 total parts in X. 6/15 of 40g: 6/15 *40 = (6*40)/15 = 240/15 = 16g. Correct.\n\nCopper: 9/15 of 40: 360/15=24g. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y:\n\nZinc:7 parts out of 18. 7/18 *60 = 7*(60/18)=7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g. So that's correct.\n\nCopper:11/18 *60 = (11*60)/18 = 660/18 = 36.666...g, which is 110/3. Correct.\n\nTotal zinc: 16 + 70/3. Let's convert 16 to thirds: 48/3. So 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3. \n\nTotal copper:24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3. 72 +110 =182 \u2192 182/3. \n\nSo ratio is 118:182. Divide numerator and denominator by 2 gives 59:91. \n\nSo that's correct. Therefore, the answer must be B or D, but since they are same, perhaps the user intended D as 59:90? Or maybe I made a mistake in the addition.\n\nWait, let me check the total copper again. 24 (from X) plus 110/3 (from Y). Let me compute 24 as 72/3. 72/3 + 110/3 is 182/3. 182 divided by 3 is 60.666..., but the actual number isn't important because when we take the ratio, the denominators cancel. \n\nWait, 118 divided by 2 is 59, and 182 divided by 2 is 91. So 59:91 is correct. \n\nHmm. Since the options have B and D as the same, perhaps there's a typo. But in the original problem, maybe the correct answer is B, which is listed first? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's question. Let me re-read the question again.\n\n\"X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z?\"\n\nYes, that's correct. So the calculation is right. \n\nGiven the options provided, since both B and D are 59:91, but that's an error. However, in the options as presented by the user, the correct answer must be B)59:91 and D)59:91. But since the options have duplicates, perhaps it's a mistake, and the intended correct answer is B. Or maybe I misread the options. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nAh, so the user probably made a typo in option D. Maybe in the original problem, D is 59:90? But given that, the correct answer is B and D. Since the user might have a typo, but in the given options, the first occurrence is B. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's actual options don't have duplicates, so I should choose B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: compute the amounts as decimals.\n\nAlloy X:\n\nZinc: (6/(6+9)) *40 = (6/15)*40 = 16g. Copper 24g. \n\nAlloy Y:\n\nZinc: (7/(7+11)) *60 = (7/18)*60 = 23.333...g. Copper (11/18)*60 =36.666...g.\n\nTotal zinc: 16 +23.333 = 39.333...g. \n\nTotal copper:24 +36.666 =60.666...g.\n\nSo ratio is 39.333... :60.666...\n\nMultiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 118 : 182, which simplifies to 59:91. \n\nSo yes, same result. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 59:91. Among the given options, both B and D have this. But since that's a duplication, perhaps it's a typo, but the first occurrence is B. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in option D's value, but given the problem as stated, the answer must be B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem's options. Let me check once more.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so the correct answer is either B or D. Since both are the same, but in an exam setting, that's impossible. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that the user made a typo and one of them is different. For example, maybe D is 59:90, but written as 91. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's correct answer is 59:91, so the answer is B. Since the options list B as 59:91, which is correct, so I should choose B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's options have a different D. Let me think. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's ratios. \n\nWait, the problem says alloy Y's ratio is 7:11. Is that zinc to copper? Yes, the question states \"mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively.\" So X is 6:9 (zinc:copper), Y is 7:11 (zinc:copper). So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Since the options have B and D as same, perhaps the correct answer is B, as the first occurrence. So I'll go with B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended D as 59:90, but wrote 91. Let me see what 59:90 would be. If the ratio was different, but that's not the case. \n\nWait, if the total zinc was 117 and copper 180, then dividing by 3 gives 39:60, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in adding 24 + 110/3? Let me check again:\n\n24 is 24 grams. 110/3 is approximately 36.666... So adding those gives 24 + 36.666 = 60.666 grams. Wait 24 + 36.666 is 60.666? Wait 24 + 36 is 60, plus 0.666 makes 60.666. Yes. \n\nSo 118/3 is about 39.333, and 182/3 is ~60.666. \n\nThus the ratio is 39.333 : 60.666, which is exactly 59:91 when simplified. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be option B or D, but since they are same, I think the intended answer is B. Unless the problem had a different option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's options are correct and I missed a step. Let me see another approach. \n\nAlternative approach: compute the total parts.\n\nAlloy X: 40g with ratio 6:9. So per gram, the parts are 6+9=15 parts. So per part, 40/15 grams. \n\nZinc in X is 6 parts \u2192 6*(40/15) = 16g, as before. \n\nCopper is 9*(40/15) =24g. \n\nAlloy Y:60g ratio 7:11. Total parts 18. Each part is 60/18 = 10/3 grams. \n\nZinc in Y is 7*(10/3) =70/3. \n\nCopper is 11*(10/3)=110/3. \n\nTotal zinc: 16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3 = 118/3. \n\nTotal copper: 24 +110/3 = (72 +110)/3 = 182/3. \n\nRatio 118/3 : 182/3 \u2192 118:182. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2 \u2192 59:91. \n\nSo yes, same result. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 59:91, which is option B and D. But given that the options have duplicates, perhaps the correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and D is different. For instance, if D is 59:90, then the correct answer would be B. \n\nSince I have to choose one, I'll go with B)59:91. \n\nWait but looking back at the options again, the user's options are:\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nSo maybe the intended answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's question. Wait, maybe the question says \"copper to zinc\" in the ratio? Let me check. \n\nThe problem says, \"the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z\". The question asks for the ratio of zinc to copper, since it's written as \"zinc and copper\", so first is zinc, then copper. So yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's options have a typo, but given the options presented, B is the first correct one. \n\nSo I'll choose B as the answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about mixing two alloys, X and Y, to form alloy Z. The question is asking for the ratio of zinc to copper in the new alloy Z. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the ratios given for each alloy. Alloy X has zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. Wait, that simplifies maybe? Let me see. 6:9 can be divided by 3, so that's 2:3. But maybe I don't need to simplify right away. The problem states the original ratios, so perhaps I should work with those numbers as given. Similarly, alloy Y is 7:11 for zinc to copper. \n\nThe problem says they take 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y, melt them together to form Z. I need to find the total amount of zinc and copper in the mixture and then find their ratio.\n\nAlright, so first, for alloy X, which is 40 grams total. The ratio of zinc to copper is 6:9. Let me think. The total parts for X's ratio are 6 + 9 = 15 parts. So each part is 40 grams divided by 15. Wait, yeah, so each part is 40/15 grams. Then zinc is 6 parts, so zinc in X would be (6/15)*40, and copper is (9/15)*40.\n\nSimilarly for alloy Y, which is 60 grams. Its ratio is 7:11. Total parts here are 7+11=18 parts. Each part is 60/18 grams. So zinc in Y is (7/18)*60 and copper is (11/18)*60.\n\nOnce I calculate the zinc and copper from each alloy, I can add them together to get total zinc and total copper in alloy Z, then form the ratio.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nStarting with Alloy X:\n\nZinc in X: (6/15)*40. Let's compute that. 6 divided by 15 is 0.4. 0.4 times 40 is 16 grams of zinc. Wait, let me do it fraction-wise to be precise. 6/15 simplifies to 2/5. So 2/5 *40 = (2*40)/5 = 80/5 = 16. That's correct. So zinc from X is 16g.\n\nCopper in X: 9/15 of 40. 9/15 is 3/5. 3/5 *40 = 24 grams. So copper from X is 24g.\n\nNow Alloy Y:\n\nTotal parts 18. Zinc is 7 parts. So 7/18 of 60g.\n\n7 divided by 18 multiplied by 60. Let's see, 60 divided by 18 is 10/3, so 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u2248 23.333... grams. Let me write that as a fraction: 70/3 grams of zinc from Y.\n\nCopper in Y is 11 parts. So 11/18 *60. 11*(60/18) = 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u2248 36.666... grams. So copper from Y is 110/3 grams.\n\nNow, total zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 70/3. Let me compute that. 16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3 grams of zinc.\n\nTotal copper is 24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3, so 72/3 +110/3 = 182/3 grams of copper.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Copper from X is 24 grams, which is 24/1, so to add to 110/3, I need common denominators. 24 is 72/3, so adding to 110/3 gives (72+110)/3 = 182/3. Yes.\n\nSo now the total zinc is 118/3 grams and copper is 182/3 grams. \n\nThe ratio of zinc to copper is (118/3) : (182/3). Since the denominators are the same, they cancel out, so it's 118 : 182. Now, I need to simplify this ratio.\n\nLet me see if 118 and 182 have a common divisor. Let's check 2 first. 118 divided by 2 is 59, 182 divided by 2 is 91. So dividing both by 2 gives 59:91. \n\nHmm, looking at the options, option D is 59:91. Let me check the options again. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91 (Wait, maybe I misread. Wait the options given in the problem: the user listed options as A to E, and D is written as \"D)59:91\" which is same as B?

That's a problem. But maybe it's a mistake in the problem's options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again step by step. Maybe I miscalculated somewhere.\n\nStarting with Alloy X: 40g. Ratio 6:9 (zinc:copper). Total parts 15. \n\nZinc: 6/15 of 40. 6/15 *40 = (6*40)/15 = 240/15 = 16g. Correct.\n\nCopper: 9/15 *40 = (9*40)/15 = 360/15 =24g. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y: 60g, ratio 7:11. Total parts 18.\n\nZinc: 7/18 *60 = (7*60)/18 = 420/18 = 23.333... which is 70/3 \u224823.333. Correct.\n\nCopper: 11/18*60 = (660)/18 = 36.666..., which is 110/3. Correct.\n\nTotal zinc: 16 +70/3. 16 is 48/3, so total 48+70=118 over 3. So 118/3 grams.\n\nTotal copper: 24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3, so 72+110=182, so 182/3. \n\nRatio zinc:copper is 118:182. Divided by 2 gives 59:91. So yes, that's correct. \n\nNow looking at the options again. The problem lists options with B and D as same? That can't be. Wait, perhaps the user made a typo. Let me check again the options as presented.\n\nThe user wrote:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, that's odd. Maybe D is supposed to be different? Like maybe a typo in the original problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me check once more.\n\nWait, maybe the ratios were read the other way? Wait, the problem says alloy X is zinc to copper 6:9. So yes, that's correct. So 6 parts zinc, 9 copper. \n\nWait, maybe when adding the copper from Y, I made an error?\n\nWait copper in Y is 11 parts. 11/18 *60. Let me calculate 11*60=660, divided by 18: 660/18 = 36.666..., which is 110/3. So that's correct. \n\nAdding to 24 grams (from X's copper):\n\n24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3. 72 +110 = 182. 182/3 is correct. \n\nSo the ratio is 118/3 : 182/3, which simplifies to 118:182. Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 59/91. So the ratio is 59:91. \n\nSo the answer should be B and D, but in the options given, both B and D are 59:91. That can't be. Wait, the user probably made a typo. Let me check the original problem again. \n\nWait the user's options are listed as:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, perhaps D is supposed to be 59:90? Like a typo in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.\n\nWait 118 divided by 2 is 59, 182 divided by 2 is 91. So 59:91 is correct. \n\nLooking at the options, B and D are the same. That's a problem. But maybe in the actual problem, there was a different option. Wait the user's input might have a mistake. Let me see the original problem again.\n\nWait in the problem statement, the options are listed as:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nAh, so both B and D are the same. That's an error. But in the original question, perhaps the user made a typo. Let me check again. Wait maybe I misread the options.\n\nWait, the user wrote:\n\nD)59:91\n\nAh, so perhaps the options are:\n\nB and D are same. So the correct answer is either B or D. But since the problem gives options with letters, and the user probably intended one of them, perhaps it's a typo. Maybe D is supposed to be different, but given the options as presented, the correct answer is 59:91, which is option B and D. Since that's impossible, perhaps there's another mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the ratio. Let me see:\n\nWait, maybe the ratio of alloy Y is 7:11 for zinc to copper. So that's correct. 7 parts zinc, 11 copper. So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is mixing up the order? Like, the problem says \"ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z\" so zinc first, copper second. Our answer is 59:91. So the options B and D are same. But the user must have a typo here. Let me check again the problem's options again.\n\nWait, perhaps the user made a mistake in option D's entry. Like maybe D is supposed to be 59:90, but it's written as 59:91. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 59:90? Let me recheck the math again.\n\nWait let me re-calculate the total zinc and copper.\n\nAlloy X:\n\nZinc: 6 parts /15 total parts in X. 6/15 of 40g: 6/15 *40 = (6*40)/15 = 240/15 = 16g. Correct.\n\nCopper: 9/15 of 40: 360/15=24g. Correct.\n\nAlloy Y:\n\nZinc:7 parts out of 18. 7/18 *60 = 7*(60/18)=7*(10/3)=70/3 \u224823.333g. So that's correct.\n\nCopper:11/18 *60 = (11*60)/18 = 660/18 = 36.666...g, which is 110/3. Correct.\n\nTotal zinc: 16 + 70/3. Let's convert 16 to thirds: 48/3. So 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3. \n\nTotal copper:24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3. 72 +110 =182 \u2192 182/3. \n\nSo ratio is 118:182. Divide numerator and denominator by 2 gives 59:91. \n\nSo that's correct. Therefore, the answer must be B or D, but since they are same, perhaps the user intended D as 59:90? Or maybe I made a mistake in the addition.\n\nWait, let me check the total copper again. 24 (from X) plus 110/3 (from Y). Let me compute 24 as 72/3. 72/3 + 110/3 is 182/3. 182 divided by 3 is 60.666..., but the actual number isn't important because when we take the ratio, the denominators cancel. \n\nWait, 118 divided by 2 is 59, and 182 divided by 2 is 91. So 59:91 is correct. \n\nHmm. Since the options have B and D as the same, perhaps there's a typo. But in the original problem, maybe the correct answer is B, which is listed first? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's question. Let me re-read the question again.\n\n\"X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z?\"\n\nYes, that's correct. So the calculation is right. \n\nGiven the options provided, since both B and D are 59:91, but that's an error. However, in the options as presented by the user, the correct answer must be B)59:91 and D)59:91. But since the options have duplicates, perhaps it's a mistake, and the intended correct answer is B. Or maybe I misread the options. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nAh, so the user probably made a typo in option D. Maybe in the original problem, D is 59:90? But given that, the correct answer is B and D. Since the user might have a typo, but in the given options, the first occurrence is B. Alternatively, perhaps the problem's actual options don't have duplicates, so I should choose B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: compute the amounts as decimals.\n\nAlloy X:\n\nZinc: (6/(6+9)) *40 = (6/15)*40 = 16g. Copper 24g. \n\nAlloy Y:\n\nZinc: (7/(7+11)) *60 = (7/18)*60 = 23.333...g. Copper (11/18)*60 =36.666...g.\n\nTotal zinc: 16 +23.333 = 39.333...g. \n\nTotal copper:24 +36.666 =60.666...g.\n\nSo ratio is 39.333... :60.666...\n\nMultiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 118 : 182, which simplifies to 59:91. \n\nSo yes, same result. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 59:91. Among the given options, both B and D have this. But since that's a duplication, perhaps it's a typo, but the first occurrence is B. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in option D's value, but given the problem as stated, the answer must be B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem's options. Let me check once more.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so the correct answer is either B or D. Since both are the same, but in an exam setting, that's impossible. Therefore, the most likely scenario is that the user made a typo and one of them is different. For example, maybe D is 59:90, but written as 91. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's correct answer is 59:91, so the answer is B. Since the options list B as 59:91, which is correct, so I should choose B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's options have a different D. Let me think. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's ratios. \n\nWait, the problem says alloy Y's ratio is 7:11. Is that zinc to copper? Yes, the question states \"mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively.\" So X is 6:9 (zinc:copper), Y is 7:11 (zinc:copper). So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Since the options have B and D as same, perhaps the correct answer is B, as the first occurrence. So I'll go with B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended D as 59:90, but wrote 91. Let me see what 59:90 would be. If the ratio was different, but that's not the case. \n\nWait, if the total zinc was 117 and copper 180, then dividing by 3 gives 39:60, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in adding 24 + 110/3? Let me check again:\n\n24 is 24 grams. 110/3 is approximately 36.666... So adding those gives 24 + 36.666 = 60.666 grams. Wait 24 + 36.666 is 60.666? Wait 24 + 36 is 60, plus 0.666 makes 60.666. Yes. \n\nSo 118/3 is about 39.333, and 182/3 is ~60.666. \n\nThus the ratio is 39.333 : 60.666, which is exactly 59:91 when simplified. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be option B or D, but since they are same, I think the intended answer is B. Unless the problem had a different option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's options are correct and I missed a step. Let me see another approach. \n\nAlternative approach: compute the total parts.\n\nAlloy X: 40g with ratio 6:9. So per gram, the parts are 6+9=15 parts. So per part, 40/15 grams. \n\nZinc in X is 6 parts \u2192 6*(40/15) = 16g, as before. \n\nCopper is 9*(40/15) =24g. \n\nAlloy Y:60g ratio 7:11. Total parts 18. Each part is 60/18 = 10/3 grams. \n\nZinc in Y is 7*(10/3) =70/3. \n\nCopper is 11*(10/3)=110/3. \n\nTotal zinc: 16 +70/3 = (48 +70)/3 = 118/3. \n\nTotal copper: 24 +110/3 = (72 +110)/3 = 182/3. \n\nRatio 118/3 : 182/3 \u2192 118:182. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2 \u2192 59:91. \n\nSo yes, same result. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 59:91, which is option B and D. But given that the options have duplicates, perhaps the correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a mistake and D is different. For instance, if D is 59:90, then the correct answer would be B. \n\nSince I have to choose one, I'll go with B)59:91. \n\nWait but looking back at the options again, the user's options are:\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nSo maybe the intended answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's question. Wait, maybe the question says \"copper to zinc\" in the ratio? Let me check. \n\nThe problem says, \"the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z\". The question asks for the ratio of zinc to copper, since it's written as \"zinc and copper\", so first is zinc, then copper. So yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's options have a typo, but given the options presented, B is the first correct one. \n\nSo I'll choose B as the answer.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z, we first calculate the amount of zinc and copper in each original alloy:\n\n**Alloy X (40 grams, ratio 6:9):**\n- Total parts = 6 + 9 = 15\n- Zinc = \\(\\frac{6}{15} \\times 40 = 16\\) grams\n- Copper = \\(\\frac{9}{15} \\times 40 = 24\\) grams\n\n**Alloy Y (60 grams, ratio 7:11):**\n- Total parts = 7 + 11 = 18\n- Zinc = \\(\\frac{7}{18} \\times 60 = \\frac{70}{3}\\) grams \u2248 23.33 grams\n- Copper = \\(\\frac{11}{18} \\times 60 = \\frac{110}{3}\\) grams \u2248 36.67 grams\n\n**Total in Alloy Z:**\n- Total zinc = \\(16 + \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{118}{3}\\) grams\n- Total copper = \\(24 + \\frac{110}{3} = \\frac{182}{3}\\) grams\n\n**Simplifying the ratio:**\n- Ratio of zinc to copper = \\(\\frac{118}{3} : \\frac{182}{3} = 118 : 182\\)\n- Dividing both by 2: \\(59 : 91\\)\n\nThe correct ratio is \\(59:91\\), which corresponds to option **B** (assuming the duplicate in option D is a typo).\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about mixing two alloys, X and Y, to form alloy Z. The question is asking for the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z. Hmm, let's see. The ratios given for the alloys are 6:9 for X and 7:11 for Y. Wait, ratios can sometimes be tricky because they might not add up to the same total. I need to find out how much zinc and copper are in each alloy when mixed, then combine them.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. Alloy X is zinc to copper in 6:9. That simplifies to 2:3, right? Because dividing both by 3. So for every 2 parts zinc, there's 3 parts copper. Similarly, alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11. That doesn't simplify further. \n\nThe problem states that we're taking 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y, melting them together to form alloy Z. I need to find the new ratio of zinc to copper in Z. \n\nOkay, so the approach here is probably to find out how much zinc and copper are in each of the original alloys, then add them up and find the total ratio. \n\nStarting with alloy X: the total parts in its ratio are 6 + 9 = 15 parts. Wait, but the original ratio is 6:9, so that's zinc to copper. So each part is 40 grams divided by 15 parts. Let me calculate that. \n\nFor alloy X:\nTotal parts = 6 + 9 = 15 parts.\nZinc in X: (6/15) of 40 grams. \nCopper in X: (9/15) of 40 grams.\n\nLet me compute those. 6 divided by 15 is 0.4. So 0.4 *40 = 16 grams of zinc. And copper would be 9/15 *40. 9 divided by 15 is 0.6, so 0.6*40=24 grams. So alloy X contributes 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\nNow for alloy Y. Its ratio is 7:11 zinc to copper. Total parts here are 7 +11 = 18 parts. The total weight here is 60 grams. \n\nZinc in Y: (7/18)*60. Let's compute that. 7 divided by 18 is approximately 0.388..., but let me do exact fractions. 7*60 =420, divided by 18. 420/18 simplifies to 70/3, which is about 23.333... grams. \n\nCopper in Y is (11/18)*60. 11*60=660, divided by 18: 660/18 is 36.666... grams. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write them as fractions. Let me see:\n\nZinc in Y: (7/18)*60 = (7*60)/18 = (7* (60/18)) = 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333g\n\nCopper in Y: (11/18)*60 = (11*60)/18 = (11*10)/3 = 110/3 \u224836.666g.\n\nSo adding up the zinc and copper from both alloys:\n\nTotal zinc = 16 (from X) + 70/3 (from Y)\n\nTotal copper =24 (from X) + 110/3 (from Y)\n\nLet me compute these numerically. \n\nFirst, converting to decimals might be easier for addition. \n\nZinc total: 16 + 23.333... = 39.333... grams\n\nCopper total: 24 + 36.666... = 60.666... grams\n\nAlternatively, using fractions:\n\nZinc total:\n\n16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3\n\nCopper total:\n\n24 is 72/3, so 72/3 + 110/3 = 182/3.\n\nSo the total zinc is 118/3 and copper is 182/3. \n\nThe ratio of zinc to copper is (118/3) : (182/3). Since the denominators are the same, they cancel out, so 118:182. \n\nNow, simplify this ratio. Let's see if 118 and 182 have a common divisor. Let me check:\n\nDivide both by 2? 118 \u00f72 =59, 182 \u00f72=91. So yes, 59:91. \n\nLooking at the options, let me check. The options are A)69:91, B)59:91, C)59:90, D)59:91, E)69:101. Wait, the options B and D are the same? Wait, the user probably made a typo. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the options given are: \n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so B and D are same. That's odd. But maybe that's a mistake. Wait, perhaps in the original problem D is different? Let me read again the user's question.\n\nWait the user wrote the options as:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so B and D are same. That's a problem. Maybe a typo? Because in the actual problem, perhaps D is different. Wait, maybe in the original problem D is 59:91 but perhaps the user made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting with alloy X: 40 grams with ratio 6:9 (zinc to copper). \n\nTotal parts 15. So zinc is (6/15)*40. 6*40 =240, divided by 15 is 16. Correct. Copper is 24. \n\nAlloy Y: 60 grams, ratio 7:11. Total parts 18. \n\nZinc is (7/18)*60. 7*60 is 420, divided by 18. 420 divided by 18 is 23.333... So that's correct. \n\nCopper is 11/18 *60 = (11*60)/18 = 660/18 = 36.666... \n\nSo total zinc is 16 + 23.333 = 39.333, copper 24 + 36.666 =60.666. \n\n39.333 to 60.666. Let's see:\n\nMultiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 39.333*3= 118, 60.666*3=182. So 118:182. Dividing both by 2 gives 59:91. So that's the ratio. \n\nSo the correct answer should be 59:91, which is option B and D. Since the options have both B and D as 59:91, that's a problem. Wait, maybe the user made a typo. Let me check again the options. The user says options are A through E as listed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the actual problem had D as 59:90 or something else. But given the options as presented, perhaps the correct answer is B. But maybe I miscalculated?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the ratio for alloy Y? Let me check again. \n\nAlloy Y's ratio is 7:11 zinc to copper. So for 60 grams. \n\nTotal parts 7+11=18. \n\nZinc is 7 parts of 18. So 7/18 *60. \n\n7/18 *60 = (7*60)/18 = (7* (60/18)) = 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333, which is correct. \n\nCopper is 11/18 *60 = 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666. Correct. \n\nTotal zinc from X is 16 (from 40g of X). 16+23.333=39.333. \n\nCopper total:24 +36.666 =60.666. \n\nSo ratio is 39.333 :60.666. \n\nLet me divide both by 39.333 to see the ratio. Wait, but the question wants the ratio of zinc to copper. \n\nAlternatively, 39.333 is 118/3, copper 182/3. \n\nSo 118/3 divided by 182/3 is 118/182 = 59/91. \n\nSo the ratio is 59:91. \n\nSo if the options have B and D as the same, then perhaps the correct answer is B. But maybe the user made a typo. Let me check the problem again. \n\nWait the user's options: \n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so B and D are same. That's probably a mistake. But since the correct answer is 59:91, then the answer must be either B or D. Since the options might have a typo, but perhaps the actual problem's D was different. Wait, maybe the user wrote option D as \"59:91\" by mistake? Or maybe I made an error in calculation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the total parts. Wait, let me check the initial ratios again. \n\nWait, the problem states alloy X is zinc to copper ratio 6:9. So that's 6 parts zinc, 9 copper. So total 15 parts. \n\nYes. \n\nAlloy Y is 7:11. So 7 zinc, 11 copper, total 18 parts. \n\nYes. \n\nHmm. So the calculation seems correct. \n\nWait, perhaps in the problem statement, the ratio is reversed? Like, maybe the question said copper to zinc instead of zinc to copper? Let me check. \n\nThe problem says: \"X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively.\" So the order is zinc first. So 6 parts zinc to 9 copper for X, and 7 to 11 for Y. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nHmm. The options B and D are same. Since the user might have made a typo, but in the given options, the correct answer is 59:91. So perhaps the correct option is B. But in the options given, both B and D have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in adding? Let's check again. \n\nZinc from X:16g, Y:70/3 (\u224823.333). Total zinc: 16 +23.333=39.333. \n\nCopper from X:24, Y: 110/3 (\u224836.666). Total copper 24 +36.666=60.666. \n\n39.333 : 60.666. \n\nLet me represent these as fractions. \n\n39.333 is 118/3, 60.666 is 182/3. \n\nSo ratio is (118/3) : (182/3) = 118:182. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 59:91. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be B) or D), but since they are same, perhaps there's a mistake. Looking at the options again, the user might have mistyped D as same as B, but in the original question, maybe D was 59:90 or another value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another approach. Let me try another way. \n\nAlternatively, compute the amount in terms of percentages. \n\nFor alloy X (40g):\n\nZinc: 6/(6+9) = 6/15 = 0.4, so 40 *0.4 =16g. \n\nCopper: 9/15 *40 =24g. Correct. \n\nAlloy Y (60g):\n\nZinc:7/(7+11) =7/18. 60*(7/18) = (60/18)*7 = (10/3)*7 =70/3 \u224823.333g. \n\nCopper:11/18 *60 = same steps gives 110/3 \u224836.666g. \n\nAdding them: \n\nZinc total =16 +70/3. Let me convert 16 to thirds: 16=48/3. So 48/3 +70/3 =118/3. \n\nCopper total:24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3. 72/3 +110/3 =182/3. \n\nSo the ratio is 118/3 divided by 182/3, which simplifies to 118/182. Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 59/91. \n\nYes, so the ratio is 59:91. \n\nSo the correct answer is 59:91, which is option B and D. But since the options list B and D as the same, that's conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo in option D? Like maybe D is 59:90? Because option C is 59:90. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where the options are different. Since the user provided the options as B and D same, but the correct answer is B. Maybe in the original problem, D is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the question had a different ratio. Let me read the problem again. \n\n\"X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z?\"\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the total parts? Like, in alloy Y, the ratio is 7:11, so 7 parts zinc to 11 parts copper. So 7+11=18 parts. 60 grams divided by 18 parts. \n\nYes, so each part is 60/18 = 10/3 grams. \n\nSo zinc is 7 parts: 7*(10/3) =70/3. Copper is 11*(10/3)=110/3. Correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is in the addition? \n\nWait, adding 16 (zinc X) and 23.333 (zinc Y) gives 39.333. 24 (Cu X) plus 36.666 (Cu Y) is 60.666. \n\n39.333:60.666. Let me see if that reduces to 59:91. \n\nLet me compute 59*60.666 divided by 39.333? Wait, perhaps cross multiply. \n\nSuppose the ratio is 59:91. \n\n59 *60.666 \u224859*60.666. Wait, perhaps better to use fractions. \n\nThe ratio is 118/3 : 182/3. So 118/182 =59/91. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. \n\nHmm. The options must have a typo. But since the user provided the options as is, and the answer is 59:91, which is present in B and D, perhaps the intended answer is B, but maybe the user's options have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the total parts. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe the question said \"copper to zinc\" instead of zinc to copper? Let me check. \n\nThe problem says: \"mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively.\" So the order is zinc first. So the first number is zinc. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is in the question's numbers. Let me check the quantities. \n\n40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y. \n\nYes. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B and D, but since the options have two same options, perhaps the correct answer is B? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options were mistyped and in the original problem, D is 59:90. But according to my calculation, the answer is 59:91. \n\nLooking at the given options again, option C is 59:90. So perhaps a miscalculation leading to that? \n\nWait, let me see: suppose I had added 16 +23.333 = 39.333 and 24 +36.666 =60.666. \n\nWait, 59 +91 =150. 59:91 adds up to 150 parts. \n\nWait, the total parts would be 59+91 =150. The total weight of alloy Z is 40+60=100 grams. \n\nWait, 59 parts zinc and 91 copper would total 150 parts for 100 grams. Hmm, but that's okay, ratios don't have to add to the total. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the addition of the zinc and copper. Wait, 16 (zinc from X) plus 23.333 (from Y) is 39.333. \n\nCopper from X is 24 plus 36.666 gives 60.666. \n\nTotal zinc: 39.333, copper 60.666. \n\nThe ratio is 39.333 :60.666. Let me divide both by 39.333 to see the ratio. \n\n60.666 divided by 39.333 is approximately 1.542. \n\nWait, 59 divided by 91 is approximately 0.648. \n\nWait, 59/91 is the zinc to copper ratio? Wait no, the ratio is zinc:copper, so 59:91. \n\nWait, 59+91 is 150. But the total mass is 100g. \n\nWait, perhaps that's okay. The ratio doesn't have to add up to 100. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the problem again. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for copper to zinc instead of zinc to copper? Let me check. \n\nNo, the question says \"ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z\". The order is zinc first. \n\nHmm. Well, given that the calculation leads to 59:91, and the options have that as B and D. Since the user's options list B and D as same, perhaps the correct answer is B. Or maybe there's a typo and D is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the copper in alloy Y? Let me check again. \n\nAlloy Y's copper is 11 parts of 18. \n\n11/18 *60 = (11*60)/18 = 660/18. \n\n660 divided by 18: 18*36=648, so 660-648=12, so 36 and 12/18 = 36.666... So that's correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had different ratios. Like, maybe alloy X was 6:9 copper to zinc? But no, the problem states zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check the options again. The user lists the options as:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nSo B and D are the same. That's likely a mistake. But given that, the answer is either B or D, but since both are same, perhaps the correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are listed correctly and there's another mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the total zinc and copper. Let me recalculate everything once more. \n\nAlloy X: 40g. \n\nZinc: 6/(6+9) = 6/15 of 40. \n\n6/15 *40 = (6*40)/15 = 240/15 =16g. \n\nCopper:9/15 *40=24g. \n\nAlloy Y:60g. \n\nZinc:7/(7+11)=7/18 of 60. \n\n7/18 *60 = (7*60)/18 =420/18 =23.333g. \n\nCopper: 11/18 *60 = 660/18=36.666g. \n\nTotal zinc:16+23.333=39.333g. \n\nTotal copper:24+36.666=60.666g. \n\n39.333 :60.666. \n\nDivide both by 3 to simplify: 13.111:20.222. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, multiply both by 3 to get rid of decimals:\n\n39.333 *3 = 118g zinc. \n\n60.666 *3 = 182g copper. \n\nWait a second! Wait, that can't be. Wait, 40g +60g is 100g total. But 118 +182 = 300g? Wait, that's impossible. Oh no! Wait, I see the mistake now. \n\nOh my god! I think I messed up the calculation here. Wait, the 39.333 and 60.666 are grams. But when I multiplied by 3, that's scaling them, but the actual total would be 39.333 +60.666 = 100g, which is correct. \n\nBut when I converted to fractions earlier, I had 118/3 and 182/3. Adding those gives (118+182)/3 = 300/3 =100. So that's okay. \n\nThe ratio is (118/3) : (182/3) =118:182, which reduces to 59:91. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm. So the problem is that the options have two same answers. Maybe in the original problem, option D is different. Like maybe 59:90, but in that case, that would be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nWait, 118 divided by 2 is 59, and 182 divided by 2 is 91. So yes, the simplified ratio is 59:91. \n\nSo the answer is B and D, but since they are same, perhaps the correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo in option D. Like maybe D is 59:91 but the actual problem had different numbers. \n\nWell, given that, the correct answer is 59:91. Since the options have it in both B and D, but in the given options, the earliest correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended D to be different, but as per given options, I have to choose between the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is from an official source, and the correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's an alternative approach where the answer is different. \n\nWait, another way: \n\nTotal zinc = (6/15)*40 + (7/18)*60 = (16) + ( (7*60)/18 ) \n\nYes, that's what I did. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant the ratio of the two alloys by weight, but no, the problem says 40g and 60g. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio for alloy Y. \n\nWait, the ratio for Y is 7:11. So 7 parts zinc to 11 parts copper. \n\nYes, so 7+11=18 parts. \n\nSo 7 parts zinc. \n\nYes, so the calculations are correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nWell, given that the correct ratio is 59:91, and both B and D have that, but the options must have a unique answer, perhaps the user made a mistake in options. Since the first occurrence is B, I'll go with B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C)59:90. But that would require a different calculation. \n\nWait, how would someone get 59:90? Let me see. \n\nSuppose someone added the parts instead of the grams. \n\nWait, like, the total parts from X and Y. \n\nX has 15 parts total (6+9), Y has 18 parts. \n\nTotal parts when mixed would be 15+18=33 parts? No, but the weights are different. \n\nAlternatively, someone might have done (6+7):(9+11) =13:20, but that's not considering the different amounts of alloys. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps someone thought the total parts of zinc and copper across both alloys. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me check once more. \n\nTotal zinc:\n\nAlloy X: 6/15 *40 = (6*40)/15 = 240/15 = 16 grams. \n\nAlloy Y:7/18 *60 = (7*60)/18 = 420/18 =23.333 grams. \n\nTotal zinc:16 +23.333 = 39.333 grams. \n\nTotal copper:\n\nAlloy X: 9/15*40 =24g \n\nAlloy Y:11/18 *60 = 36.666g \n\nTotal copper: 24 +36.666 =60.666g \n\nRatio: 39.333 : 60.666 \n\nDividing both by 39.333 gives 1 : 1.542, which is roughly 59:91. \n\nAlternatively, cross-multiplying:\n\nLet me write the ratio as 39.333 /60.666 = ?\n\n39.333 divided by 60.666 is approximately 0.648, which is 59/91 (since 59 divided by 91 is approximately 0.648). \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the correct ratio is 59:91, which is option B and D. \n\nSince the options have a duplication, but in the given choices, both B and D are correct. But that's probably a mistake. However, the first occurrence is B, so I think the answer is B. Alternatively, maybe the options were meant to have option D as 59:90, but the user mistyped. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B)59:91. \n\nSo I'll go with B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about mixing two alloys, X and Y, to form alloy Z. The question is asking for the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z. Hmm, let's see. The ratios given for the alloys are 6:9 for X and 7:11 for Y. Wait, ratios can sometimes be tricky because they might not add up to the same total. I need to find out how much zinc and copper are in each alloy when mixed, then combine them.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. Alloy X is zinc to copper in 6:9. That simplifies to 2:3, right? Because dividing both by 3. So for every 2 parts zinc, there's 3 parts copper. Similarly, alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11. That doesn't simplify further. \n\nThe problem states that we're taking 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y, melting them together to form alloy Z. I need to find the new ratio of zinc to copper in Z. \n\nOkay, so the approach here is probably to find out how much zinc and copper are in each of the original alloys, then add them up and find the total ratio. \n\nStarting with alloy X: the total parts in its ratio are 6 + 9 = 15 parts. Wait, but the original ratio is 6:9, so that's zinc to copper. So each part is 40 grams divided by 15 parts. Let me calculate that. \n\nFor alloy X:\nTotal parts = 6 + 9 = 15 parts.\nZinc in X: (6/15) of 40 grams. \nCopper in X: (9/15) of 40 grams.\n\nLet me compute those. 6 divided by 15 is 0.4. So 0.4 *40 = 16 grams of zinc. And copper would be 9/15 *40. 9 divided by 15 is 0.6, so 0.6*40=24 grams. So alloy X contributes 16g Zn and 24g Cu.\n\nNow for alloy Y. Its ratio is 7:11 zinc to copper. Total parts here are 7 +11 = 18 parts. The total weight here is 60 grams. \n\nZinc in Y: (7/18)*60. Let's compute that. 7 divided by 18 is approximately 0.388..., but let me do exact fractions. 7*60 =420, divided by 18. 420/18 simplifies to 70/3, which is about 23.333... grams. \n\nCopper in Y is (11/18)*60. 11*60=660, divided by 18: 660/18 is 36.666... grams. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write them as fractions. Let me see:\n\nZinc in Y: (7/18)*60 = (7*60)/18 = (7* (60/18)) = 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333g\n\nCopper in Y: (11/18)*60 = (11*60)/18 = (11*10)/3 = 110/3 \u224836.666g.\n\nSo adding up the zinc and copper from both alloys:\n\nTotal zinc = 16 (from X) + 70/3 (from Y)\n\nTotal copper =24 (from X) + 110/3 (from Y)\n\nLet me compute these numerically. \n\nFirst, converting to decimals might be easier for addition. \n\nZinc total: 16 + 23.333... = 39.333... grams\n\nCopper total: 24 + 36.666... = 60.666... grams\n\nAlternatively, using fractions:\n\nZinc total:\n\n16 is 48/3, so 48/3 +70/3 = 118/3\n\nCopper total:\n\n24 is 72/3, so 72/3 + 110/3 = 182/3.\n\nSo the total zinc is 118/3 and copper is 182/3. \n\nThe ratio of zinc to copper is (118/3) : (182/3). Since the denominators are the same, they cancel out, so 118:182. \n\nNow, simplify this ratio. Let's see if 118 and 182 have a common divisor. Let me check:\n\nDivide both by 2? 118 \u00f72 =59, 182 \u00f72=91. So yes, 59:91. \n\nLooking at the options, let me check. The options are A)69:91, B)59:91, C)59:90, D)59:91, E)69:101. Wait, the options B and D are the same? Wait, the user probably made a typo. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the options given are: \n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so B and D are same. That's odd. But maybe that's a mistake. Wait, perhaps in the original problem D is different? Let me read again the user's question.\n\nWait the user wrote the options as:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so B and D are same. That's a problem. Maybe a typo? Because in the actual problem, perhaps D is different. Wait, maybe in the original problem D is 59:91 but perhaps the user made a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, let me check my steps again.\n\nStarting with alloy X: 40 grams with ratio 6:9 (zinc to copper). \n\nTotal parts 15. So zinc is (6/15)*40. 6*40 =240, divided by 15 is 16. Correct. Copper is 24. \n\nAlloy Y: 60 grams, ratio 7:11. Total parts 18. \n\nZinc is (7/18)*60. 7*60 is 420, divided by 18. 420 divided by 18 is 23.333... So that's correct. \n\nCopper is 11/18 *60 = (11*60)/18 = 660/18 = 36.666... \n\nSo total zinc is 16 + 23.333 = 39.333, copper 24 + 36.666 =60.666. \n\n39.333 to 60.666. Let's see:\n\nMultiply both by 3 to eliminate decimals: 39.333*3= 118, 60.666*3=182. So 118:182. Dividing both by 2 gives 59:91. So that's the ratio. \n\nSo the correct answer should be 59:91, which is option B and D. Since the options have both B and D as 59:91, that's a problem. Wait, maybe the user made a typo. Let me check again the options. The user says options are A through E as listed. \n\nHmm, perhaps the actual problem had D as 59:90 or something else. But given the options as presented, perhaps the correct answer is B. But maybe I miscalculated?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the ratio for alloy Y? Let me check again. \n\nAlloy Y's ratio is 7:11 zinc to copper. So for 60 grams. \n\nTotal parts 7+11=18. \n\nZinc is 7 parts of 18. So 7/18 *60. \n\n7/18 *60 = (7*60)/18 = (7* (60/18)) = 7*(10/3) = 70/3 \u224823.333, which is correct. \n\nCopper is 11/18 *60 = 11*(10/3) = 110/3 \u224836.666. Correct. \n\nTotal zinc from X is 16 (from 40g of X). 16+23.333=39.333. \n\nCopper total:24 +36.666 =60.666. \n\nSo ratio is 39.333 :60.666. \n\nLet me divide both by 39.333 to see the ratio. Wait, but the question wants the ratio of zinc to copper. \n\nAlternatively, 39.333 is 118/3, copper 182/3. \n\nSo 118/3 divided by 182/3 is 118/182 = 59/91. \n\nSo the ratio is 59:91. \n\nSo if the options have B and D as the same, then perhaps the correct answer is B. But maybe the user made a typo. Let me check the problem again. \n\nWait the user's options: \n\nOptions:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nHmm, so B and D are same. That's probably a mistake. But since the correct answer is 59:91, then the answer must be either B or D. Since the options might have a typo, but perhaps the actual problem's D was different. Wait, maybe the user wrote option D as \"59:91\" by mistake? Or maybe I made an error in calculation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the total parts. Wait, let me check the initial ratios again. \n\nWait, the problem states alloy X is zinc to copper ratio 6:9. So that's 6 parts zinc, 9 copper. So total 15 parts. \n\nYes. \n\nAlloy Y is 7:11. So 7 zinc, 11 copper, total 18 parts. \n\nYes. \n\nHmm. So the calculation seems correct. \n\nWait, perhaps in the problem statement, the ratio is reversed? Like, maybe the question said copper to zinc instead of zinc to copper? Let me check. \n\nThe problem says: \"X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively.\" So the order is zinc first. So 6 parts zinc to 9 copper for X, and 7 to 11 for Y. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nHmm. The options B and D are same. Since the user might have made a typo, but in the given options, the correct answer is 59:91. So perhaps the correct option is B. But in the options given, both B and D have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in adding? Let's check again. \n\nZinc from X:16g, Y:70/3 (\u224823.333). Total zinc: 16 +23.333=39.333. \n\nCopper from X:24, Y: 110/3 (\u224836.666). Total copper 24 +36.666=60.666. \n\n39.333 : 60.666. \n\nLet me represent these as fractions. \n\n39.333 is 118/3, 60.666 is 182/3. \n\nSo ratio is (118/3) : (182/3) = 118:182. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 59:91. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be B) or D), but since they are same, perhaps there's a mistake. Looking at the options again, the user might have mistyped D as same as B, but in the original question, maybe D was 59:90 or another value. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check another approach. Let me try another way. \n\nAlternatively, compute the amount in terms of percentages. \n\nFor alloy X (40g):\n\nZinc: 6/(6+9) = 6/15 = 0.4, so 40 *0.4 =16g. \n\nCopper: 9/15 *40 =24g. Correct. \n\nAlloy Y (60g):\n\nZinc:7/(7+11) =7/18. 60*(7/18) = (60/18)*7 = (10/3)*7 =70/3 \u224823.333g. \n\nCopper:11/18 *60 = same steps gives 110/3 \u224836.666g. \n\nAdding them: \n\nZinc total =16 +70/3. Let me convert 16 to thirds: 16=48/3. So 48/3 +70/3 =118/3. \n\nCopper total:24 + 110/3. 24 is 72/3. 72/3 +110/3 =182/3. \n\nSo the ratio is 118/3 divided by 182/3, which simplifies to 118/182. Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 59/91. \n\nYes, so the ratio is 59:91. \n\nSo the correct answer is 59:91, which is option B and D. But since the options list B and D as the same, that's conflicting. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo in option D? Like maybe D is 59:90? Because option C is 59:90. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where the options are different. Since the user provided the options as B and D same, but the correct answer is B. Maybe in the original problem, D is different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should check if the question had a different ratio. Let me read the problem again. \n\n\"X and Y are two alloys which were made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively. If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z, what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z?\"\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the total parts? Like, in alloy Y, the ratio is 7:11, so 7 parts zinc to 11 parts copper. So 7+11=18 parts. 60 grams divided by 18 parts. \n\nYes, so each part is 60/18 = 10/3 grams. \n\nSo zinc is 7 parts: 7*(10/3) =70/3. Copper is 11*(10/3)=110/3. Correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is in the addition? \n\nWait, adding 16 (zinc X) and 23.333 (zinc Y) gives 39.333. 24 (Cu X) plus 36.666 (Cu Y) is 60.666. \n\n39.333:60.666. Let me see if that reduces to 59:91. \n\nLet me compute 59*60.666 divided by 39.333? Wait, perhaps cross multiply. \n\nSuppose the ratio is 59:91. \n\n59 *60.666 \u224859*60.666. Wait, perhaps better to use fractions. \n\nThe ratio is 118/3 : 182/3. So 118/182 =59/91. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. \n\nHmm. The options must have a typo. But since the user provided the options as is, and the answer is 59:91, which is present in B and D, perhaps the intended answer is B, but maybe the user's options have a mistake. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the total parts. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe the question said \"copper to zinc\" instead of zinc to copper? Let me check. \n\nThe problem says: \"mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9 and 7:11, respectively.\" So the order is zinc first. So the first number is zinc. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is in the question's numbers. Let me check the quantities. \n\n40 grams of X and 60 grams of Y. \n\nYes. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B and D, but since the options have two same options, perhaps the correct answer is B? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options were mistyped and in the original problem, D is 59:90. But according to my calculation, the answer is 59:91. \n\nLooking at the given options again, option C is 59:90. So perhaps a miscalculation leading to that? \n\nWait, let me see: suppose I had added 16 +23.333 = 39.333 and 24 +36.666 =60.666. \n\nWait, 59 +91 =150. 59:91 adds up to 150 parts. \n\nWait, the total parts would be 59+91 =150. The total weight of alloy Z is 40+60=100 grams. \n\nWait, 59 parts zinc and 91 copper would total 150 parts for 100 grams. Hmm, but that's okay, ratios don't have to add to the total. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation in the addition of the zinc and copper. Wait, 16 (zinc from X) plus 23.333 (from Y) is 39.333. \n\nCopper from X is 24 plus 36.666 gives 60.666. \n\nTotal zinc: 39.333, copper 60.666. \n\nThe ratio is 39.333 :60.666. Let me divide both by 39.333 to see the ratio. \n\n60.666 divided by 39.333 is approximately 1.542. \n\nWait, 59 divided by 91 is approximately 0.648. \n\nWait, 59/91 is the zinc to copper ratio? Wait no, the ratio is zinc:copper, so 59:91. \n\nWait, 59+91 is 150. But the total mass is 100g. \n\nWait, perhaps that's okay. The ratio doesn't have to add up to 100. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the problem again. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for copper to zinc instead of zinc to copper? Let me check. \n\nNo, the question says \"ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z\". The order is zinc first. \n\nHmm. Well, given that the calculation leads to 59:91, and the options have that as B and D. Since the user's options list B and D as same, perhaps the correct answer is B. Or maybe there's a typo and D is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the copper in alloy Y? Let me check again. \n\nAlloy Y's copper is 11 parts of 18. \n\n11/18 *60 = (11*60)/18 = 660/18. \n\n660 divided by 18: 18*36=648, so 660-648=12, so 36 and 12/18 = 36.666... So that's correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had different ratios. Like, maybe alloy X was 6:9 copper to zinc? But no, the problem states zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check the options again. The user lists the options as:\n\nA)69:91\n\nB)59:91\n\nC)59:90\n\nD)59:91\n\nE)69:101\n\nSo B and D are the same. That's likely a mistake. But given that, the answer is either B or D, but since both are same, perhaps the correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are listed correctly and there's another mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the total zinc and copper. Let me recalculate everything once more. \n\nAlloy X: 40g. \n\nZinc: 6/(6+9) = 6/15 of 40. \n\n6/15 *40 = (6*40)/15 = 240/15 =16g. \n\nCopper:9/15 *40=24g. \n\nAlloy Y:60g. \n\nZinc:7/(7+11)=7/18 of 60. \n\n7/18 *60 = (7*60)/18 =420/18 =23.333g. \n\nCopper: 11/18 *60 = 660/18=36.666g. \n\nTotal zinc:16+23.333=39.333g. \n\nTotal copper:24+36.666=60.666g. \n\n39.333 :60.666. \n\nDivide both by 3 to simplify: 13.111:20.222. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, multiply both by 3 to get rid of decimals:\n\n39.333 *3 = 118g zinc. \n\n60.666 *3 = 182g copper. \n\nWait a second! Wait, that can't be. Wait, 40g +60g is 100g total. But 118 +182 = 300g? Wait, that's impossible. Oh no! Wait, I see the mistake now. \n\nOh my god! I think I messed up the calculation here. Wait, the 39.333 and 60.666 are grams. But when I multiplied by 3, that's scaling them, but the actual total would be 39.333 +60.666 = 100g, which is correct. \n\nBut when I converted to fractions earlier, I had 118/3 and 182/3. Adding those gives (118+182)/3 = 300/3 =100. So that's okay. \n\nThe ratio is (118/3) : (182/3) =118:182, which reduces to 59:91. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm. So the problem is that the options have two same answers. Maybe in the original problem, option D is different. Like maybe 59:90, but in that case, that would be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nWait, 118 divided by 2 is 59, and 182 divided by 2 is 91. So yes, the simplified ratio is 59:91. \n\nSo the answer is B and D, but since they are same, perhaps the correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user made a typo in option D. Like maybe D is 59:91 but the actual problem had different numbers. \n\nWell, given that, the correct answer is 59:91. Since the options have it in both B and D, but in the given options, the earliest correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user intended D to be different, but as per given options, I have to choose between the options. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is from an official source, and the correct answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's an alternative approach where the answer is different. \n\nWait, another way: \n\nTotal zinc = (6/15)*40 + (7/18)*60 = (16) + ( (7*60)/18 ) \n\nYes, that's what I did. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should calculate the total parts. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant the ratio of the two alloys by weight, but no, the problem says 40g and 60g. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the ratio for alloy Y. \n\nWait, the ratio for Y is 7:11. So 7 parts zinc to 11 parts copper. \n\nYes, so 7+11=18 parts. \n\nSo 7 parts zinc. \n\nYes, so the calculations are correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nWell, given that the correct ratio is 59:91, and both B and D have that, but the options must have a unique answer, perhaps the user made a mistake in options. Since the first occurrence is B, I'll go with B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is C)59:90. But that would require a different calculation. \n\nWait, how would someone get 59:90? Let me see. \n\nSuppose someone added the parts instead of the grams. \n\nWait, like, the total parts from X and Y. \n\nX has 15 parts total (6+9), Y has 18 parts. \n\nTotal parts when mixed would be 15+18=33 parts? No, but the weights are different. \n\nAlternatively, someone might have done (6+7):(9+11) =13:20, but that's not considering the different amounts of alloys. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps someone thought the total parts of zinc and copper across both alloys. \n\nWait, but that's not correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me check once more. \n\nTotal zinc:\n\nAlloy X: 6/15 *40 = (6*40)/15 = 240/15 = 16 grams. \n\nAlloy Y:7/18 *60 = (7*60)/18 = 420/18 =23.333 grams. \n\nTotal zinc:16 +23.333 = 39.333 grams. \n\nTotal copper:\n\nAlloy X: 9/15*40 =24g \n\nAlloy Y:11/18 *60 = 36.666g \n\nTotal copper: 24 +36.666 =60.666g \n\nRatio: 39.333 : 60.666 \n\nDividing both by 39.333 gives 1 : 1.542, which is roughly 59:91. \n\nAlternatively, cross-multiplying:\n\nLet me write the ratio as 39.333 /60.666 = ?\n\n39.333 divided by 60.666 is approximately 0.648, which is 59/91 (since 59 divided by 91 is approximately 0.648). \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the correct ratio is 59:91, which is option B and D. \n\nSince the options have a duplication, but in the given choices, both B and D are correct. But that's probably a mistake. However, the first occurrence is B, so I think the answer is B. Alternatively, maybe the options were meant to have option D as 59:90, but the user mistyped. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B)59:91. \n\nSo I'll go with B.\n\n\nTo determine the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z, we first calculate the amounts of zinc and copper in each original alloy.\n\n**Alloy X (40 grams):**\n- Ratio of zinc to copper = 6:9 (total parts = 15)\n- Zinc: \\(\\frac{6}{15} \\times 40 = 16\\) grams\n- Copper: \\(\\frac{9}{15} \\times 40 = 24\\) grams\n\n**Alloy Y (60 grams):**\n- Ratio of zinc to copper = 7:11 (total parts = 18)\n- Zinc: \\(\\frac{7}{18} \\times 60 = \\frac{420}{18} = \\frac{70}{3} \\approx 23.333\\) grams\n- Copper: \\(\\frac{11}{18} \\times 60 = \\frac{660}{18} = \\frac{110}{3} \\approx 36.666\\) grams\n\n**Total zinc and copper in alloy Z:**\n- Total zinc: \\(16 + \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{48}{3} + \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{118}{3}\\) grams\n- Total copper: \\(24 + \\frac{110}{3} = \\frac{72}{3} + \\frac{110}{3} = \\frac{182}{3}\\) grams\n\nThe ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is \\(\\frac{118/3}{182/3} = \\frac{118}{182}\\). Simplifying by dividing both numerator and denominator by 2 gives \\(\\frac{59}{91}\\), or 59:91.\n\nThe correct answer is **B** (since both B and D list 59:91, but B is the first occurrence).\n\nAnswer: B",
