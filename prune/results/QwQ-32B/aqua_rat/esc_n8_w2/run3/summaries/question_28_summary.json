      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The question is about a computer routine that generates two numbers, x and y. The first number x is a random number between 0 and 100, inclusive. The second number y has to be less than or equal to the square root of the first. So for each pair given in the options, I need to check if y <= sqrt(x). The one that doesn't satisfy this condition is the answer.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: (99,10). Let's calculate the square root of 99. Hmm, sqrt(100) is 10, so sqrt(99) must be just a bit less than 10. Like around 9.949 or something. So the y value here is 10. Wait, but the square root is less than 10. So 10 would be greater than the square root. That means this pair might be invalid. But let me check the other options first to be sure.\n\nOption B: (85,9). The square root of 85. Let me think. 9 squared is 81, 10 squared is 100. So sqrt(85) is between 9 and 10. Specifically, sqrt(81) is 9, so sqrt(85) is like 9.21. Since the y is 9 here, which is less than 9.21, so that's okay. So B is valid.\n\nOption C: (50,7). Square root of 50. Hmm, sqrt(49) is 7, so sqrt(50) is a bit more than 7, like 7.07. The y here is 7, which is less than 7.07. So that's okay. So C is valid.\n\nOption D: (1,1). The square root of 1 is exactly 1. The condition is y <= sqrt(x), so 1 is equal, so that's allowed. So D is okay.\n\nOption E: (1,0). The square root of 1 is 1, and 0 is less than that. So yes, that's valid too.\n\nSo going back to option A: 99's sqrt is about 9.949. The y here is 10, which is greater than that. Therefore, the pair (99,10) does not satisfy the condition. So the answer should be A. Let me double-check all the others again quickly. Yep, B's 9 is less than ~9.21. C's 7 is okay. D and E are okay. So A is the exception.\n",
