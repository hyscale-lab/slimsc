      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about probability. So there are 5 horses in a race, and Mr. Jain picks two at random. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. Hmm. \n\nAlright, first, I should figure out the total number of possible ways he can choose two horses out of five. Since the order doesn't matter here, like choosing horse A and B is the same as B and A, so combinations. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!).\n\nSo 5 choose 2 would be 5!/(2! * 3!) = (5*4)/2 = 10. So there are 10 possible pairs he could pick.\n\nNow, the question is, how many of those pairs include the winning horse? Let's think of the winning horse as a specific one, say Horse W. We need to count how many pairs include W and another horse. \n\nIf one of the two selected must be W, then the other horse can be any of the remaining 4. So the number of favorable pairs is 4. Because for each of the other 4 horses, pairing them with W gives a unique pair. Like W and A, W and B, etc. So 4 pairs.\n\nTherefore, the probability is the number of favorable over total, which is 4/10. Wait, but simplifying that gives 2/5. Hmm, but let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, another way to think: the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. Then, if he didn't pick the winner first, the second pick has a 1/4 chance? Wait, maybe that approach is more complicated because the selections are without replacement. \n\nAlternatively, since he picks two horses, the probability that the winner is among the two he selected. So the chance that the winner is in the two selected is equal to the number of favorable selections divided by total selections, which as before is 4/10 = 2/5. So that would be option B. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, the total number of possible pairs is 10, as I had before. The number of pairs that include the winning horse is indeed 4, because there are 4 other horses to pair with the winner. So 4/10 reduces to 2/5. So that would be option B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. The probability that he picks the winning horse in either of his two choices. The chance that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. The chance that the second horse is the winner, given that the first wasn't, is (4/5)*(1/4) = 1/5. So adding those together, 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5. Yep, that gives the same answer. \n\nTherefore the correct answer should be B) 2/5. Let me check the options again. The options are A)1/5, B)2/5, so that's correct. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me confirm once more. Let's say the winning horse is W. The total possible pairs are C(5,2)=10. The pairs that include W are (W,A), (W,B), (W,C), (W,D) assuming the other horses are A,B,C,D. So that's 4 pairs. So 4/10 simplifies to 2/5. Yep, so that's right. So the answer is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse when he randomly chooses two out of five horses, we start by calculating the total number of possible pairs. Using combinations, this is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10\n\\]\n\nNext, we count the number of favorable pairs that include the winning horse. If the winning horse is denoted as \\( W \\), it can be paired with any of the remaining 4 horses.

We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. First, the total number of possible ways he can choose two horses out of five. Since the order doesn't matter here, that's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!). So for 5 horses choosing 2, that would be 5C2. Let me calculate that: 5*4/(2*1) = 10. So total possible pairs are 10.\n\nNow the question is, how many of these pairs include the winning horse. Let me think. Let's say the winning horse is one specific horse, say Horse A. To find the number of pairs that include Horse A, we need to pair it with any of the other 4 horses. Because once you've chosen the winning horse, the second horse can be any of the remaining 4. So for each of the other horses, there's a pair with the winner. So that's 4 pairs. \n\nWait, so the number of favorable outcomes is 4, and total is 10. So the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner, plus the probability that the second horse is the winner but not the first. Wait, but since he's selecting two without order, maybe combinations are better here.\n\nAlternatively, another approach: The probability that he picks the winning horse is the same as 1 minus the probability he didn't pick it. Let's see.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 horses without the winner: there are 4 non-winning horses. So choosing 2 from them would be 4C2 = 6. So the number of unfavorable pairs is 6. So the probability of not picking the winner is 6/10 = 3/5. Therefore, the probability of having the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. That matches the first calculation. So that would be option B, 2/5.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose the winning horse is W. The number of pairs that include W is indeed 4: because each of the other four horses can pair with W. So 4 pairs. Total pairs 10. 4/10 reduces to 2/5. So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be B) 2/5.\n\nHmm, but another way: the chance that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. Then, the second horse can be any of the remaining 4, so after picking the winner first, the second is 4/4 (since he just needs any other). Wait, no, actually, the probability that the first is the winner is 1/5, and then the second can be any of the remaining 4. Wait, but the total probability would be (1/5)*(4/4) + (4/5)*(1/4). Because if he didn't pick the winner first (4/5 chance), then the second pick has a 1/4 chance of being the winner. Adding those two: (1/5)*1 + (4/5)*(1/4) = 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/5. Yep, same result. So that confirms it again.\n\nSo all approaches lead to 2/5. The answer must be B.\n",
