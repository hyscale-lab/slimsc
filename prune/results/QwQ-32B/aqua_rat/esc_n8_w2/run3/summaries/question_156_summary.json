      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the smallest integer is -50. The options are given, and I have to pick the right one. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for the sum of consecutive integers. The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula: sum = (number of terms)/2 * (first term + last term). Since these are consecutive integers, the difference between each term is 1. \n\nThe problem states that the first term is -50, and there are k terms. The sum is 51. So I can set up the equation here. Let me denote the first term as a1 = -50, and the number of terms as k. The last term, which I'll call an, would be a1 + (k-1)*d, where d is the common difference. Since they are consecutive integers, d=1. So the last term is -50 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k -51.\n\nPlugging into the sum formula: sum = k/2 * (a1 + an) = 51. \n\nSo substituting the values:\nk/2 * [ (-50) + (k -51) ] = 51\n\nLet me simplify the expression inside the brackets first. -50 plus (k -51) equals k -51 -50, which is k -101. \n\nSo the equation becomes:\nk/2 * (k - 101) = 51\n\nHmm, now I have a quadratic equation here. Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\nk*(k - 101) = 102\n\nExpanding the left side:\nk\u00b2 - 101k = 102\n\nBring all terms to one side to form the quadratic equation:\nk\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0\n\nNow, I need to solve this quadratic equation for k. Let me see if I can factor it. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add up to -101. Wait, the product is -102, and the sum is -101. Let me think. Let's see factors of 102. 102 factors into 2*51, 3*34, 6*17. Hmm, perhaps the numbers are 102 and -1? Because 102 * (-1) = -102, and 102 + (-1) = 101. But the equation has -101k, so the coefficients would be (k -102)(k +1) = 0? Let me check.\n\nExpanding (k -102)(k +1) = k\u00b2 +k -102k -102 = k\u00b2 -101k -102. Yes, that's exactly our equation. So the factors are (k -102)(k +1) =0. \n\nTherefore, the solutions are k=102 or k = -1. Since the number of terms can't be negative, k=102 is the solution. But wait, let me check the options. Option E is 102, so that's one of the choices. But let me double-check because sometimes there might be a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait a second, let me verify this. If k is 102, then the sequence starts at -50 and has 102 terms. The last term would be -50 + 101 (since the difference between terms is 1, so the nth term is a1 + (n-1)*1). So last term is -50 +101 = 51. \n\nThen the sum would be (number of terms)/2 * (first + last) = 102/2 * (-50 +51) = 51 * (1) =51. That's exactly the sum given. So that checks out. \n\nHmm, but looking at the options, E is 102, so that's the answer. But wait, the options also include 82, 92, etc. Did I make a mistake in the quadratic?\n\nWait let me retrace my steps again. The equation was set up as:\n\nsum = k/2*(first + last). The first is -50, last term is (-50 +k-1) = k-51. So the equation is k*(k-101)/2 =51. Then multiplying both sides by 2 gives k(k-101)=102. So k\u00b2 -101k -102=0. Factored as (k-102)(k+1)=0. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the last term. Let me think again: the first term is -50, and there are k terms. The sequence is -50, -49, ..., up to the kth term. The last term is the first term plus (k-1). So yes, -50 + (k-1) = k-51. \n\nHmm, so the calculation seems right. But let me check another way. Maybe using another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the sum of consecutive integers from a to b is (b -a +1)*(a + b)/2. Here, a is -50 and the number of terms is k, so (b - (-50) +1) = k \u2192 b = -50 +k -1 = k-51, same as before. So the sum is k*( -50 + (k-51) ) / 2 =51. Which is the same equation as before. So the answer is indeed 102, so option E.\n\nWait but let me check another option. For example, if the answer was 40 (option A), then let's see:\n\nIf k=40, then last term is -50 +39 = -11. The sum would be 40/2*(-50 + (-11))=20*(-61)= -1220, which is way off. \n\nWhat about option B)62? Let's see: last term is 62-51 =11? Wait, no, wait, 62-51 would be 11? Wait, no. Wait, last term is k-51. So 62-51=11. So sum is 62/2*(-50 +11)=31*(-39)= -1209, which is not 51. \n\nHow about option C)82? Then last term would be 82-51 =31. Sum would be 82/2*(-50 +31)=41*(-19) = -779, still not 51. \n\nOption D)92: last term is 92-51=41. Sum is 92/2*(-50+41)=46*(-9)= -414. Not 51. \n\nOnly when k=102, then the last term is 102-51=51. Sum is (102/2)*(-50+51) =51*1=51. Exactly the sum. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the answer must be E)102. But the options given include E as 102, so that's correct. Therefore the correct answer is E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50, and I need to find k. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (first term + last term), right? So here, the sum S is given as 51. The first term is -50, and the number of terms is k. But I need to find the last term or express it in terms of k to solve for k.\n\nWait, the last term would be the first term plus (k-1) times the common difference. Since the common difference here is 1, the last term is -50 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k -51. \n\nSo substituting into the sum formula: 51 = (k/2) * [ (-50) + (k -51) ]. Let me compute the terms inside the brackets first. Adding those two gives (-50) + (k -51) = k - 101. \n\nSo the equation becomes 51 = (k/2)(k - 101). Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 102 = k(k - 101). \n\nExpanding the right side gives k\u00b2 - 101k. So the equation is k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the algebra again. Let me see: \n\nWait, 51 = (k/2)(k - 101). Multiply both sides by 2: 102 = k(k -101). So rearranged, that's k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0. Hmm, that quadratic equation. Let me solve for k using quadratic formula. \n\nThe quadratic is of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, so here a is 1, b is -101, c is -102. The quadratic formula is k = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the values:\n\nDiscriminant D = (-101)^2 -4*1*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609. What's the square root of 10609? Hmm, let me think. 100 squared is 10000, so sqrt(10609) is 103, because 103 squared is 10609 (since 100\u00b2 + 2*100*3 + 3\u00b2 = 10000 + 600 +9 = 10609). So sqrt(D) is 103.\n\nTherefore, k = [101 \u00b1103]/2. So two solutions: (101 + 103)/2 = 204/2 = 102, and (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Since k can't be negative, the solution is 102. So the answer is E)102? Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I might have messed up the signs in the equation.\n\nWait, let's go back through the steps again to make sure. The first term is -50, and there are k terms. The last term would be first term plus (k-1). So yes, that's -50 +k -1 = k-51. The sum is average times number of terms. The average of the first and last term is [ (-50) + (k-51) ] / 2, multiplied by k gives the sum. \n\nSo the equation was set correctly. Let me plug k=102 into the original equation to see if it works. Let's see:\n\nSum = (102/2) * [ -50 + (102 -51) ] = 51 * [ -50 +51 ] = 51*(1) =51. That's exactly the given sum. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, if I had chosen another option, like option E is 102, so that's correct. Let me check another option just to be safe. Let's see, for example, if someone thought the last term was wrong. Suppose someone thought the last term is -50 +k, but no, the formula is first term plus (k-1)*difference. So that part was right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in forming the equation. Let me see:\n\nThe sum is 51 = (k/2)[first + last]. The first is -50, the last is (first + (k-1)*1). So substituting gives the equation correctly. \n\nHmm, so then the answer is E)102. Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So E is the last option. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the sum of k consecutive integers is 51\". Let me think of another approach. The sum starting at -50 and adding consecutive numbers until you get to some number, such that the total is 51. Let's see, perhaps by counting terms. \n\nStarting at -50, adding each next integer. The sum is 51. Let me think: the sum from -50 up to some number n. Let's see, the sum from -50 to n is equal to 51. \n\nAlternatively, the sum from -50 to n is the same as the sum from 1 to n minus the sum from 1 to 49 (since negative numbers would be subtracted). Wait, maybe that complicates. Alternatively, the formula approach is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the average multiplied by the number of terms. The average of the sequence is (first + last)/2, so the average times k equals 51. Since the average is ( -50 + (last) ) / 2. \n\nSo, when the average is 51/k, but maybe that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the sum as starting at -50 and adding k terms. Let me think of the terms as -50, -49, -48, ..., up to (-50 +k -1). So the terms go from -50 to ( -50 +k-1 ). The total sum is 51. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can also be written as the sum from n = -50 to n = (-50 +k-1) of n. The formula for the sum from a to b inclusive is (b -a +1)(a + b)/2. Here, a is -50, b is (-50 +k-1) = (k-51). So the number of terms is ( (k-51) - (-50) ) +1 = (k -51 +50) +1 = (k -1) +1 =k, which checks out. \n\nSo the sum is (k) * [ (-50) + (k-51) ] /2 = 51. Which is exactly the equation I set up before. So solving that gives k=102, so E is correct. \n\nHmm, so I think that's the right answer. Let me check another possible approach. Suppose the sequence starts at -50 and has k terms. The sum is 51. Let me think of the sum as the sum from term 1 to term k, starting at -50. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total can be considered as the sum of numbers from -50 to some number N, and N is the last term. The number of terms is k = N - (-50) +1 = N +51. \n\nThe sum of numbers from a to b is (b -a +1)(a + b)/2. So in this case, the sum is (N +51)(-50 + N)/2 =51. \n\nSo substituting N = (k -51), since N = last term, which is -50 +k-1 =k-51. So substituting N gives the same equation as before. \n\nAlternatively, plugging k=102 gives N =102-51=51. So the last term is 51. Then the sum would be from -50 to 51. Let me compute that sum. \n\nThe number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1 = 51 +50 +1= 102, which matches k=102. The sum would be (102/2)*(-50 +51) =51*(1) =51. Perfect, that's exactly what's needed. \n\nSo yeah, that works. So the answer must be E)102. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another possible answer. For example, maybe I made an error in the quadratic solution. Let me check the quadratic equation again. \n\nWe had the equation: k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0. \n\nSolving using quadratic formula: \n\nk = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101\u00b2 +4*1*102)] / 2. Wait, wait, hold on! Wait a second, in the quadratic equation ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0, the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b= -101, c= -102. So discriminant D is (-101)^2 -4*(1)(-102) = 10201 +408 = 10609. Which is correct. sqrt(10609)=103. So the solutions are [101 \u00b1103]/2. \n\nSo 101+103=204 \u2192 204/2=102. The other solution is (101-103)= -2 \u2192 -2/2= -1. So yeah, 102 is the only positive solution. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50, and I need to find k. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they are consecutive integers, the common difference is 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (first term + last term), right? So here, the sum S is given as 51. The first term is -50, and the number of terms is k. But I need to find the last term or express it in terms of k to solve for k.\n\nWait, the last term would be the first term plus (k-1) times the common difference. Since the common difference here is 1, the last term is -50 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k -1 = k -51. \n\nSo substituting into the sum formula: 51 = (k/2) * [ (-50) + (k -51) ]. Let me compute the terms inside the brackets first. Adding those two gives (-50) + (k -51) = k - 101. \n\nSo the equation becomes 51 = (k/2)(k - 101). Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 102 = k(k - 101). \n\nExpanding the right side gives k\u00b2 - 101k. So the equation is k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the algebra again. Let me see: \n\nWait, 51 = (k/2)(k - 101). Multiply both sides by 2: 102 = k(k -101). So rearranged, that's k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0. Hmm, that quadratic equation. Let me solve for k using quadratic formula. \n\nThe quadratic is of the form ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, so here a is 1, b is -101, c is -102. The quadratic formula is k = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the values:\n\nDiscriminant D = (-101)^2 -4*1*(-102) = 10201 + 408 = 10609. What's the square root of 10609? Hmm, let me think. 100 squared is 10000, so sqrt(10609) is 103, because 103 squared is 10609 (since 100\u00b2 + 2*100*3 + 3\u00b2 = 10000 + 600 +9 = 10609). So sqrt(D) is 103.\n\nTherefore, k = [101 \u00b1103]/2. So two solutions: (101 + 103)/2 = 204/2 = 102, and (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Since k can't be negative, the solution is 102. So the answer is E)102? Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes I might have messed up the signs in the equation.\n\nWait, let's go back through the steps again to make sure. The first term is -50, and there are k terms. The last term would be first term plus (k-1). So yes, that's -50 +k -1 = k-51. The sum is average times number of terms. The average of the first and last term is [ (-50) + (k-51) ] / 2, multiplied by k gives the sum. \n\nSo the equation was set correctly. Let me plug k=102 into the original equation to see if it works. Let's see:\n\nSum = (102/2) * [ -50 + (102 -51) ] = 51 * [ -50 +51 ] = 51*(1) =51. That's exactly the given sum. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, if I had chosen another option, like option E is 102, so that's correct. Let me check another option just to be safe. Let's see, for example, if someone thought the last term was wrong. Suppose someone thought the last term is -50 +k, but no, the formula is first term plus (k-1)*difference. So that part was right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in forming the equation. Let me see:\n\nThe sum is 51 = (k/2)[first + last]. The first is -50, the last is (first + (k-1)*1). So substituting gives the equation correctly. \n\nHmm, so then the answer is E)102. Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So E is the last option. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the sum of k consecutive integers is 51\". Let me think of another approach. The sum starting at -50 and adding consecutive numbers until you get to some number, such that the total is 51. Let's see, perhaps by counting terms. \n\nStarting at -50, adding each next integer. The sum is 51. Let me think: the sum from -50 up to some number n. Let's see, the sum from -50 to n is equal to 51. \n\nAlternatively, the sum from -50 to n is the same as the sum from 1 to n minus the sum from 1 to 49 (since negative numbers would be subtracted). Wait, maybe that complicates. Alternatively, the formula approach is better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the average multiplied by the number of terms. The average of the sequence is (first + last)/2, so the average times k equals 51. Since the average is ( -50 + (last) ) / 2. \n\nSo, when the average is 51/k, but maybe that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the sum as starting at -50 and adding k terms. Let me think of the terms as -50, -49, -48, ..., up to (-50 +k -1). So the terms go from -50 to ( -50 +k-1 ). The total sum is 51. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sum can also be written as the sum from n = -50 to n = (-50 +k-1) of n. The formula for the sum from a to b inclusive is (b -a +1)(a + b)/2. Here, a is -50, b is (-50 +k-1) = (k-51). So the number of terms is ( (k-51) - (-50) ) +1 = (k -51 +50) +1 = (k -1) +1 =k, which checks out. \n\nSo the sum is (k) * [ (-50) + (k-51) ] /2 = 51. Which is exactly the equation I set up before. So solving that gives k=102, so E is correct. \n\nHmm, so I think that's the right answer. Let me check another possible approach. Suppose the sequence starts at -50 and has k terms. The sum is 51. Let me think of the sum as the sum from term 1 to term k, starting at -50. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total can be considered as the sum of numbers from -50 to some number N, and N is the last term. The number of terms is k = N - (-50) +1 = N +51. \n\nThe sum of numbers from a to b is (b -a +1)(a + b)/2. So in this case, the sum is (N +51)(-50 + N)/2 =51. \n\nSo substituting N = (k -51), since N = last term, which is -50 +k-1 =k-51. So substituting N gives the same equation as before. \n\nAlternatively, plugging k=102 gives N =102-51=51. So the last term is 51. Then the sum would be from -50 to 51. Let me compute that sum. \n\nThe number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1 = 51 +50 +1= 102, which matches k=102. The sum would be (102/2)*(-50 +51) =51*(1) =51. Perfect, that's exactly what's needed. \n\nSo yeah, that works. So the answer must be E)102. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another possible answer. For example, maybe I made an error in the quadratic solution. Let me check the quadratic equation again. \n\nWe had the equation: k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0. \n\nSolving using quadratic formula: \n\nk = [101 \u00b1 sqrt(101\u00b2 +4*1*102)] / 2. Wait, wait, hold on! Wait a second, in the quadratic equation ax\u00b2 +bx +c =0, the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b= -101, c= -102. So discriminant D is (-101)^2 -4*(1)(-102) = 10201 +408 = 10609. Which is correct. sqrt(10609)=103. So the solutions are [101 \u00b1103]/2. \n\nSo 101+103=204 \u2192 204/2=102. The other solution is (101-103)= -2 \u2192 -2/2= -1. So yeah, 102 is the only positive solution. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E.\n\n\nThe sum of k consecutive integers starting from -50 is given by the formula for an arithmetic series: \\( S = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term}) \\).
