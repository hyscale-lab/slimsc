      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a retailer selling an appliance for 40% above cost, and the gross profit is $20. I need to find the selling price. Hmm, right. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that gross profit is calculated as selling price minus cost price. So if the selling price is 40% above cost, then the profit must be that 40% of the cost. Wait, the question says that the 40% above cost \"represented a gross profit of $20\". Wait, maybe I need to clarify that.\n\nWait, let me parse the question again. The retailer sold the appliance for 40% above cost. The amount of that markup (the 40%) is equal to the gross profit, which is $20. So the 40% of the cost is $20. Because the profit is the difference between selling price and cost. So if the selling price is cost plus 40% of cost, then profit is 0.4 * cost. And that equals $20. \n\nSo let me set variables. Let's let C be the cost price. Then the selling price S is C + 0.4C = 1.4C. The gross profit here is 0.4C, which is $20. So 0.4C = 20. To find C, I can divide 20 by 0.4. 20 divided by 0.4 is 50. So the cost is $50. Then the selling price is 1.4 times that, so 1.4 * 50. Let me calculate that. 1.4 times 50 is 70. So the selling price is $70. \n\nLooking at the options, D is $70. So the answer should be D. Let me check the options again. The options are A)27.30, B)51, C)63, D)70, E)91. Yep, D is there. \n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through again. The profit is 40% of cost, which is $20. So 0.4*C = 20 \u2192 C = 20/0.4 = 50. Then selling price is 50 + 20 =70. That's correct. Alternatively, 1.4*50 is 70. So that's right. So the answer is D.\n",

The question is asking for the selling price. Hmm, right. So I need to figure out the cost first, maybe?\n\nAlright, let's break it down. The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost. The problem says that the 40% above cost is the profit. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second. Wait, when they say \"sold for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00\"\u2014so the 40% markup is the gross profit. So the 40% is of the cost, right?\n\nSo let me think. Let me denote the cost price as C. Then the selling price would be C plus 40% of C. So the selling price S = C + 0.4C = 1.4C. The gross profit here is 0.4C, and that's given as $20. So 0.4C = 20. Then solving for C, that would be C = 20 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is the same as 20 divided by 2/5, which is 20 multiplied by 5/2. That gives 50. So the cost is $50. Then the selling price is 1.4 times 50, which would be... 1.4 * 50. Let me compute that. 1 times 50 is 50, 0.4 times 50 is 20, so total is 70. So the selling price is $70. So looking at the options, D is $70.00. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The problem states that the 40% above cost is the gross profit. So the gross profit is 40% of cost, which equals $20. So yes, 0.4C = 20, so C is 50, so selling price is 70. That seems right. Let me check the options again. Option D is 70. So that's the answer. I don't see any other possibilities here. Maybe someone could confuse the profit being 40% of the selling price, but the question says \"40 percent above cost\", which implies that the markup is 40% of the cost. So yeah, the answer is D.\n",
