      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a rope that's 20 meters long being cut into two pieces. One piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. I need to find the length of the longer piece. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nAlright, let's see. Let me try to set up some equations. Let me call the longer piece, like, x meters. Then the shorter one would be x minus 3 meters because it's 3 meters shorter. Right? So the total length when you add both pieces should be 20 meters. \n\nSo the equation would be x (the longer piece) plus (x - 3) (the shorter piece) equals 20. Let me write that down: x + (x - 3) = 20. \n\nWait, combining those terms: x + x is 2x, and then minus 3. So 2x - 3 = 20. To solve for x, I can add 3 to both sides. That gives 2x = 23. Then divide both sides by 2, so x = 11.5. Oh, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again. Option D is 11.5, so that's probably the answer. \n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If the longer is 11.5, then the shorter is 11.5 -3 = 8.5. Adding them together: 11.5 +8.5 = 20. Exactly. That works. So yeah, D must be correct. Let me look at the options again to make sure I didn't misread. The options are A)7.5, B)8.9, C)9.9, D)11.5, E)11.7. Yep, D is there. \n\nHmm, but wait another thought: maybe I should have set it up differently. Like, maybe let the two pieces be y and y + 3? Wait no, because if one is shorter, then perhaps the other is longer. Let me think again. Let me try another approach. Let me call the shorter piece's length as s, then the longer would be s +3. Then total length is s + (s +3) =20. That would be 2s +3 =20. Then 2s =17, so s=8.5. Then the longer is 8.5+3=11.5. Same answer. So that checks out. \n\nSo either way, the longer piece is 11.5. So the answer is D. The other options don't make sense. Like if someone thought the average was 10, then subtract 1.5 and add 1.5, but that's not the case here. Wait, maybe someone could have set up the equations wrong. Like if they thought the difference is 3, so (20-3)/2 and then add 3? Let's see. (20-3)/2 is 17/2=8.5, then adding 3 would get 11.5 again. So yeah, same result. \n\nI think that's solid. The answer must be D.\n",
