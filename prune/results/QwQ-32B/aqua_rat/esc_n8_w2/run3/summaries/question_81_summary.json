      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Arjun and Sajal have some money, and there are two conditions given. Hmm. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nThe question says: If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, Arun? Wait, the names here are Arjun and Sajal. Maybe that's a typo? Because the options mention Arjun and Sajal. So probably it's Arjun giving money. Let me assume that. So first scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. After that, Sajal's amount becomes twice what Arjun has left.\n\nSecond condition: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal has left. \n\nI need to set up equations for these two scenarios. Let me denote the current amount of money that Arjun has as A, and Sajal's as S. Then, let's translate the conditions into equations.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. So Arjun's new amount is A - 30. Sajal's new amount is S + 30. According to the problem, in this case, Sajal's new amount is twice Arjun's remaining. So:\n\nS + 30 = 2*(A - 30)\n\nThat's the first equation.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. So Sajal's new amount is S -10, and Arjun's becomes A +10. Then, Arjun has thrice what Sajal has left. So:\n\nA + 10 = 3*(S -10)\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) S +30 = 2(A -30)\n2) A +10 =3(S -10)\n\nNow I need to solve these two equations for A and S.\n\nLet me rewrite the first equation:\n\nS +30 = 2A -60\n\nSo rearranged: S = 2A -60 -30 \u2192 S = 2A -90\n\nSecond equation:\n\nA +10 = 3S -30 \u2192 A = 3S -30 -10 \u2192 A =3S -40\n\nNow substitute S from the first equation into the second equation. Let me see.\n\nFrom first equation, S = 2A -90. Substitute this into the second equation's expression for A.\n\nWait, the second equation gives A in terms of S. Let me plug S =2A -90 into the second equation's A =3S -40.\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, the second equation was A = 3S -40. So substituting S from first equation into that:\n\nA = 3*(2A -90) -40\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nA = 6A -270 -40 \u2192 A =6A -310 \u2192 \n\nBring terms together: \n\nA -6A = -310 \u2192 -5A = -310 \u2192 A = (-310)/-5 \u2192 A= 62.\n\nHmm, so Arjun has $62? Let me check that. Then S would be S=2A -90. So 2*62 is 124 minus 90 is 34. So Sajal has 34? Let me check if that fits the second equation.\n\nSecond equation: A +10 =3(S-10). Let's plug A=62 and S=34.\n\nLeft side: 62+10 =72. Right side: 3*(34-10)=3*(24)=72. Yes, that works. \n\nNow check the first condition. If Arjun gives 30 to Sajal:\n\nArjun would have 62-30=32, Sajal would have 34+30=64. 64 is twice 32. That works.\n\nSo the answer would be Arjun has 62, Sajal has 34. Looking at the options:\n\nOption B is (62,34). So the answer should be B. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)62,35 \u2192 no, Sajal's is 34 here.\n\nB)62,34 \u2192 yes.\n\nC)34,62 \u2192 that would be Sajal having more, but in the first condition, after giving, Sajal has twice Arjun's. Let me see. If the answer were C, then original Sajal is 62. If Arjun (34) gives 30, he has 4 left, Sajal would have 92. 92 is not twice 4. So that's wrong. So B is correct.\n\nWait, just to be thorough. Let me check other options in case I made a mistake.\n\nOption E is 62,42. Let me see. Suppose Sajal has 42. Then first equation:\n\nS +30 = 72. Arjun after giving 30 would have 62-30=32. 72 is twice 32? 32*2 is 64, so no. So that's wrong.\n\nOption D is 42,62. Let's see. If Arjun has 42, Sajal 62. Then first condition: Arjun gives 30, he has 12. Sajal has 92. 92 is twice 12? 12*2 is 24, no. Not correct.\n\nSo B is the correct answer. So the answer is B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Arjun and Sajal and their money. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking how much each of them has. The options are given, so maybe I can set up equations based on the problem's conditions and see which pair fits.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The problem says:\n\nIf Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, hold on, the names here... Wait, the question mentions Arjun and Sajal as friends. But the first condition says \"If Arun gives $30 to Sajal...\" Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo? Because the names are Arjun and Sajal. Oh, maybe Arun is a typo for Arjun. I'll assume that's the case, because otherwise the names don't match. So I'll proceed with Arjun giving $30 to Sajal.\n\nSo, first scenario: Arjun gives $30 to Sajal. After that, Sajal's money becomes twice what Arjun has left. Let me denote their original amounts as variables. Let me let A be the amount Arjun has, and S be Sajal's amount.\n\nSo, in the first case:\n\nAfter giving $30, Arjun has A - 30 left. Sajal has S + 30. According to the problem, Sajal's amount after this transaction is twice Arjun's remaining amount. So the equation would be:\n\nS + 30 = 2*(A - 30)\n\nThat's the first equation.\n\nThe second condition is: if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal has left. So in that scenario, Sajal gives away $10, so Sajal has S - 10 left, and Arjun has A +10. The condition here is that Arjun's new amount is three times Sajal's. So:\n\nA + 10 = 3*(S - 10)\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1) S + 30 = 2*(A - 30)\n2) A + 10 = 3*(S - 10)\n\nNow I need to solve these two equations for A and S. Let me rearrange both equations to make substitution easier.\n\nStarting with equation 1:\n\nS + 30 = 2A - 60  \nSo, S = 2A - 60 - 30  \nWait, subtract 30 from both sides first. Let me re-arrange step by step:\n\nEquation 1:\nS + 30 = 2(A - 30)  \n=> S + 30 = 2A - 60  \nSubtract 30 from both sides:  \nS = 2A - 60 -30  \nWait, that's 2A - 90. Wait, 2A -60 minus 30? Wait, 2(A-30) is 2A -60, so S +30 equals that. So subtract 30 from both sides:\n\nS = 2A -60 -30 \u2192 S = 2A -90. So equation one becomes S = 2A -90.\n\nEquation 2:\n\nA + 10 = 3(S -10)  \nExpand the right side: 3S - 30  \nSo equation 2 is: A +10 = 3S -30  \nSo rearranged, A = 3S -30 -10 \u2192 A = 3S -40.\n\nSo now we can substitute equation 1 into equation 2. Since equation 1 says S = 2A -90, substitute that into equation 2's expression for A.\n\nWait, equation 2 says A = 3S -40. So substituting S from equation 1 into this:\n\nA = 3*(2A -90) -40  \nLet me compute that:\n\nA = 6A - 270 -40  \n\u2192 A =6A - 310  \nNow, subtract 6A from both sides:  \n-5A = -310  \nDivide both sides by -5:  \nA = (-310)/(-5) = 62.\n\nSo A is 62. Then substitute back into equation 1 to find S.\n\nEquation 1: S = 2A -90 \u2192 2*62 is 124. 124 -90 = 34. So S is 34.\n\nSo Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $34. Let's check the options.

Sajal has 34 +30=64. Is 64 equal to twice 32? Yes, because 2*32 is 64. That's good.\n\nSecond condition: Sajal gives 10 to Arjun. Sajal would have 34-10=24. Arjun has 62+10=72.

Sajal has 34 +30=64. Is 64 equal to twice 32? Yes, because 2*32 is 64. That's good.\n\nSecond condition: Sajal gives 10 to Arjun. Sajal would have 34-10=24. Arjun has 62+10=72. Is 72 equal to thrice 24? 3*24 is 72. Yes, that works too.\n\nSo the calculations are correct. The answer must be B) 62,34.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote Arjun's money as \\( A \\) and Sajal's money as \\( S \\).\n\n**First condition**: If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun:\n\\[\nS + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nS = 2A - 90 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n\\]\n\n**Second condition**: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal:\n\\[\nA + 10 = 3(S - 10)\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\nA = 3S - 40 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n\\]\n\n**Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2**:\n\\[\nA = 3(2A - 90) - 40\n\\]\n\\[\nA = 6A - 270 - 40\n\\]\n\\[\n-5A = -310\n\\]\n\\[\nA = 62\n\\]\n\n**Substitute \\( A = 62 \\) back into Equation 1**:\n\\[\nS = 2(62) - 90 = 124 - 90 = 34\n\\]\n\n**Verification**:\n- **First condition**: Arjun gives $30 \u2192 \\( 62 - 30 = 32 \\). Sajal gets $30 \u2192 \\( 34 + 30 = 64 \\). \\( 64 = 2 \\times 32 \\) \u2714\ufe0f.\n- **Second condition**: Sajal gives $10 \u2192 \\( 34 - 10 = 24 \\). Arjun gets $10 \u2192 \\( 62 + 10 = 72 \\). \\( 72 = 3 \\times 24 \\) \u2714\ufe0f.\n\nThe correct answer is **B) 62, 34**.\n\nAnswer: B",
