      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this equation: [5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 -7] divided by [13\u00d713 -156] equals 6. The question is asking for the value of the question mark. Hmm, right, so I have to find the number that replaces the question mark so that the equation holds true. \n\nFirst, let me parse the equation step by step. The numerator is 5 plus something multiplied by 19, minus 15 and minus 7. Wait, but order of operations is important here. Since multiplication comes before addition and subtraction, the ? \u00d719 part should be calculated first. So the numerator would be 5 plus (result of ?\u00d719) minus 15 minus 7. \n\nLet me write that out numerically. Let me denote the unknown as x for clarity. So the numerator is 5 + x\u00d719 -15 -7. Let me simplify that. Let's combine the constants first. 5 minus 15 is -10, and then minus another 7 would be -17. So the numerator simplifies to (19x -17). Wait, wait, let me check again. Wait, 5 plus (19x) then minus 15 and minus7. So yes: 5 -15 is -10, then minus7 is -17. So the numerator is 19x -17.\n\nThe denominator is 13\u00d713 minus 156. Let's compute that. 13\u00d713 is 169. Then subtract 156. 169 minus 156 is 13. So denominator simplifies to 13. \n\nSo the equation becomes (19x -17)/13 =6. Now I need to solve for x. \n\nMultiply both sides by 13 to get rid of the denominator: 19x -17 = 6\u00d713. Let me calculate 6\u00d713: that's 78. So:\n\n19x -17 =78\n\nNow add 17 to both sides: 19x =78 +17 =95.\n\nThen divide both sides by 19: x=95/19. Let's compute that. 19 times 5 is 95, right? 19\u00d75 is 95. So x=5. \n\nWait, so the answer is 5? Let me check the options. The options are A)4, B)4.5, C)5, D)5.5, E)6.5. So option C is 5. That would be the correct answer. \n\nBut let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nStarting with the original equation:\n\n[Numerator]/[Denominator] =6\n\nNumerator: 5 + x\u00d719 -15 -7. Let me recalculate that step by step. \n\nLet me compute each term in the numerator:\n\nFirst term:5, then plus (x*19), then minus15, then minus7. \n\nSo combining the constants: 5 -15 =-10. Then -10 -7 = -17. So the numerator is indeed 19x -17. \n\nDenominator:13\u00d713 is 169, minus156 is 13. So denominator is correct. \n\nSo equation is (19x-17)/13 =6 \u2192 19x -17 =78 \u2192 19x=95 \u2192 x=5. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So the answer should be C)5.\n",

Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably rewrite the equation to make it clearer. The main equation is:\n\n(5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 -7) / (13\u00d713 - 156) = 6\n\nI need to solve for the question mark, which I'll call x for simplicity. So substituting x in, the equation becomes:\n\n[5 + x\u00d719 -15 -7] divided by [13\u00d713 -156] equals 6.\n\nAlright, let me handle the denominator first because that might be simpler. The denominator is 13\u00d713 minus 156. Let me calculate 13\u00d713 first. 13 times 13 is 169. Then subtract 156 from that. 169 minus 156 is... 13. Oh, that's nice.

So the numerator part, which is 5 + x\u00d719 -15 -7, must equal 78.\n\nSo let's set up that equation:\n\n5 + (19x) -15 -7 = 78\n\nWait, let me make sure I parse the numerator correctly. The original numerator is 5 plus (x multiplied by 19) minus 15 minus 7. So order of operations, multiplication comes first, so the x*19 is done first. Then the rest is addition and subtraction from left to right.\n\nSo combining the constants first. Let's compute the constants:\n\n5 -15 -7. Let's see: 5 minus 15 is -10, then minus 7 more is -17. So the numerator becomes (19x) + (5 -15 -7) = 19x -17. Wait, yes, that's the same as 5 +19x -15 -7. So 19x -17 must equal 78.\n\nSo the equation is 19x -17 =78.\n\nNow solving for x:\n\nAdd 17 to both sides: 19x = 78 +17 = 95.\n\nThen divide both sides by 19: x = 95 /19.\n\nHmm, 19 times 5 is 95, right?

Let me confirm all steps again to be sure.\n\nStarting over:\n\nDenominator: 13\u00d713 is 169, minus 156 is 13. Correct.\n\nSo numerator must be 6\u00d713 =78. \n\nOriginal numerator: 5 + (x*19) -15 -7. \n\nLet me compute that again with x=5:\n\n5 + (5\u00d719) -15 -7. \n\n5\u00d719 is 95. Then 5 +95 is 100. Then subtract 15: 100-15=85, then subtract 7: 85-7=78. Exactly. So that works.\n\nSo the correct value is 5. Looking at the options, option C is 5. So the answer should be C.
