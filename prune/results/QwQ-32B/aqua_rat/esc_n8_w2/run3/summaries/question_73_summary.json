      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about finding the perimeter of a rectangle. The given length is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters. Hmm, right. I remember that the perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides. Wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, the formula for perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times length plus 2 times width. Or maybe it's 2*(length + width). Yeah, that's the same thing. Let me make sure.\n\nSo, if the length is 8 cm and the width is 3 cm, then plugging into the formula: 2*(8 + 3). Let's compute that. 8 plus 3 is 11. Then 2 times 11 would be 22. Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A)18, B)22, C)20, D)30, E)28. So 22 is option B. But hold on, maybe I did that wrong. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate each side individually. The rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So 8 cm times 2 is 16, and 3 cm times 2 is 6. Adding those together gives 16 + 6 = 22. Yep, that's the same answer. So that would be B. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up length and width. The problem says length is 8 and width 3, so that's correct. The perimeter is all the sides added. So 8+3+8+3 equals 22. Yeah, that's the same as before. So the answer should be B)22cm. I don't see any other possibilities here. The options don't have 22 as anything else. So I think that's right.\n",

Hmm, right, perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding up all the sides. Wait, but there's a formula for that. Oh right, the formula for perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times length plus 2 times width. Or maybe it's 2 times (length plus width). Let me think. Either way, same thing.\n\nSo the length is 8 cm and the width is 3 cm. Let me plug those numbers in. Let's do it step by step. If I take 2 times the length, that would be 2 * 8, which is 16. Then 2 times the width is 2 * 3, which is 6. Adding those two gives 16 + 6 = 22. Wait, but that would be option B, 22 cm. Hmm, but wait another way to think of it is adding all four sides. So length + width + length + width. That's 8 + 3 +8 +3. Let's add that up. 8+3 is 11, plus another 8 is 19, then plus 3 is 22. Yeah, same answer. So the perimeter should be 22 cm, which is option B. Let me check the options again. The options are A)18, B)22, C)20, D)30, E)28. So B is there. Wait, but wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me confirm the perimeter formula again. The standard formula is 2*(length + width). So 8+3 is 11, multiplied by 2 is 22. Yep, that's correct. So the answer must be B.
