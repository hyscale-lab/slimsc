      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the minimum selling price per component that ensures the company's yearly profit is at least $626,400. Hmm, profit is revenue minus costs, right? So first, I should probably figure out the total revenue and total costs over a year, then set up an equation where profit meets or exceeds that target.\n\nThe company makes 420 units each month. So in a year, that's 420 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that. 420 times 12... 400*12 is 4800, plus 20*12 which is 240, so total is 5040 units per year. Got that.\n\nEach component costs them $110 to produce. So the total production cost for the year would be 5040 units times $110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040*10 is 50,400. So adding those gives 554,400. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 110 is 100 +10, so yeah, so 5040*(100+10) = 504,000 +50,400 = 554,400. So total cost per year is $554,400.\n\nNow, the revenue is the selling price per unit (let's call it P) multiplied by the number of units sold in a year, which is 5040. So revenue is 5040*P.\n\nProfit is Revenue minus Cost. The problem states that the profit must be at least $626,400. So the equation would be:\n\n5040*P - 554,400 \u2265 626,400\n\nI need to solve for P here. Let me rearrange the inequality. \n\nFirst, add 554,400 to both sides:\n\n5040*P \u2265 626,400 + 554,400\n\nCalculating the right side: 626,400 + 554,400. Let's see, 600k +500k is 1,100,000, and 26,400 +54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. \n\nSo 5040*P \u2265 1,180,800. \n\nThen divide both sides by 5040 to get P:\n\nP \u2265 1,180,800 / 5040\n\nHmm, let me compute that. Let's see, maybe simplify the numbers. \n\nFirst, let's divide numerator and denominator by 10 to make it 118,080 / 504. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps divide numerator and denominator by 5040's factors. Let me think. Let's see, 5040 divided by 10 is 504, so maybe 5040 is 504*10. Alternatively, let's see 5040 divided by 5040. Let me compute the division step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 5040 x 200 is 1,008,000. So 1,180,800 minus that would be 172,800. Then, 5040 times 34 is... Hmm, maybe this isn't the best way.\n\nAlternatively, 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me write this as (1,180,800 \u00f7 5040).\n\nLet me try simplifying:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nAgain divide numerator and denominator by 12: 118,080 \u00f712=9840; 504 \u00f712=42. So now 9840 /42.\n\nHmm, 42*200 is 8400. 9840 -8400 =1440. 42*34 is 1428 (since 42*30=1260, plus 42*4=168 \u2192 1428). So 200 +34 =234, and 1440-1428=12. So remainder 12. Hmm so 234 + 12/42. So that's 234.2857... So approximately 234.29. Wait, but since the question asks for the minimum price to guarantee the profit is at least 626,400, then the price must be at least that. Since the price per component must be a whole number (the options are all integers), then we need to round up to the next whole dollar. So 234.2857 would round up to 235. But wait, the options don't have 235. Wait, let me check my math again because the options given are 226, 230, 240, 260, 280. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in calculations?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the addition earlier. Let me go back step by step.\n\nTotal cost per year: 420 units/month * 12 months = 5040 units. Each costs $110. So 5040 * 110. Let me compute that again. 5000*110 is 550,000. 40*110 is 4,400. So total 554,400. That's correct.\n\nThe required profit is at least 626,400. So total revenue must be profit + cost. 626,400 +554,400. Let me add again: 626,400 +554,400. 600k +500k is 1,100,000. 26,400 +54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. That's correct.\n\nSo 5040 * P >= 1,180,800 \u2192 P >= 1,180,800 /5040. Let me do that division again. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 11,808 /50.4. Hmm, maybe not helpful. Let me try another approach. Let me see 5040 * 230 = ?\n\n5040 *200 = 1,008,000. 5040 *30=151,200. So total 1,008,000 +151,200 =1,159,200. That's less than 1,180,800. So 230 would give revenue of 1,159,200. Subtract that from the required revenue: 1,180,800 -1,159,200 =21,600. So each additional dollar per unit would add 5040 dollars to the revenue. So 21,600 /5040 = 4.2857. So 230 + 4.2857 is 234.2857. So same as before. So the minimum price is 234.2857, which would need to round up to 235. But the options don't have 235. Hmm, but the options given are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. So maybe I made a mistake here. Because 234.28 is not an option. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup?\n\nWait the question says \"yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400\". So profit = revenue - cost. So the calculation is correct. So the required P is 234.2857. Since the options are all integers, the minimum selling price must be the next integer, which is 235. But since 235 isn't an option, maybe I messed up in the calculation steps?\n\nWait let me check the division again. Let me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040.\n\nLet me do 5040 \u00d7 240 = ?\n\n5040 \u00d7 200 = 1,008,000. 5040 \u00d740 = 201,600. Adding those gives 1,209,600. That's more than needed. So 240 would give 1,209,600 revenue. So the profit would be 1,209,600 -554,400 = 655,200, which is more than the required 626,400. So 240 is sufficient. But maybe the correct answer is 240 because 234.28 is not an option, so you have to pick the next available higher option. But the options have 230 and 240. Wait, but 230 gives revenue of 1,159,200. Then profit would be 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800, which is less than 626,400. So 230 is insufficient. So the next option is 240, which gives a higher profit. Therefore, the minimum price is 240, option C.\n\nWait so that's the case. Because 234.2857 is not an option, so the minimal possible from the options is 240, which would work. So the correct answer must be C)240. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the required price. Let me check again:\n\nTotal required revenue is 1,180,800. Divided by 5040 units:\n\n1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 5040's factors. Let's see, 5040 = 7*720. Hmm, perhaps 5040 divided by 5040 is 1, but perhaps breaking down:\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 /504.\n\nThen divide numerator and denominator by 24: 118080 \u00f724 = 4920; 504 \u00f724 =21. So 4920/21. Let's compute that.\n\n21 \u00d7 234 = 21*(200+34) = 4200 + 714 = 4914. So 4920-4914=6. So 234 +6/21 = 234.2857. Yep, so exactly the same. So the minimum is 234.2857. Since the options don't have that, so the next possible price is 235, but since that's not an option, the next available is 240. So the answer must be C. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is C)240.\n",

Let me write down the numbers:\n\nMonthly production: 420 units.\nYearly production = 420 * 12. Let me calculate that. 420 times 12 is like 420*10=4200 plus 420*2=840, so total 5040 units per year. Got that.\n\nThe production cost per component is $110. So the total production cost per year is 5040 * 110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 100 would be 504,000, and 5040 *10 is 50,400. So adding those gives 554,400. So total cost is $554,400 per year. \n\nThe revenue comes from selling all the components each month. Since they sell all by the end of each month, the total revenue per year would be the selling price per unit (let's call it S) multiplied by the total units sold, which is 5040. So revenue is 5040 * S.\n\nProfit is Revenue - Cost. The problem states that the profit must be at least $626,400. So setting up the inequality:\n\nRevenue - Cost \u2265 626,400  \n5040*S - 554,400 \u2265 626,400\n\nNow I need to solve for S. Let's rearrange:\n\n5040*S \u2265 626,400 + 554,400  \nAdding those two numbers: 626,400 + 554,400. Let's see: 626,400 + 500,000 is 1,126,400, then +54,400 more gives 1,180,800. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 626,400 plus 554,400. Let me add them properly. 600k + 500k is 1,100k, then 26,400 +54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. So:\n\n5040*S \u2265 1,180,800  \nThen, divide both sides by 5040 to get S.\n\nLet me compute 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Hmm. Maybe simplify the numbers. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10 to make it 118,080 / 504. Hmm, perhaps further divide by 24? Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, let me see how many times 5040 goes into 1,180,800. Alternatively, perhaps factor both numbers. Let me see:\n\n5040 is 720 *7 (since 720*7 is 5040). Wait 720*7 is 5040? Let's check: 700*7=4900, 20*7=140 \u2192 5040. Yes.\n\nThe numerator is 1,180,800. Let's see if dividing numerator and denominator by 5040 first. Alternatively, perhaps divide numerator and denominator by 10 first, so it becomes 118,080 divided by 504. Let me try dividing numerator and denominator by 24: 118080 \u00f724 = 4920, and 504 \u00f724 is 21. So now it's 4920/21. Let me compute that.\n\n21 \u00d7 234 = 21*(200 +34) = 4200 + 714 = 4914. Hmm, so 21 \u00d7234=4914. The numerator here is 4920. So 4920 -4914 is 6. So 4920/21 =234 +6/21=234.2857... Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another approach. Let me try dividing 1,180,800 \u00f75040. Let's see:\n\n5040 \u00d7 200 = 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 -1,008,000 =172,800.\n\nNow, 5040 \u00d7 34 = 5040*30 =151,200 plus 5040*4=20,160 \u2192 total 171,360. Hmm, 172,800 -171,360 =1,440. \n\nSo 200 +34 =234, and remaining 1,440. \n\nNow 5040 \u00d7 0.2857 \u22481,440? Let me see: 5040 \u00d70.2857 \u22485040*(2/7) since 0.2857 is approx 2/7. 5040 divided by 7 is 720. So 2/7 is 1440. Exactly. So 5040*(2/7)= 1440. \n\nTherefore, 234 + 2/7 = 234.2857. So S must be at least approximately 234.2857. Since the question asks for the minimum selling price that will guarantee the profit, we need to round up to the nearest whole dollar, because if it's 234.28, then the price must be at least that. But since the options are all whole numbers, the minimum would be 235? Wait but the options given are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. Hmm, 234.2857 is between 230 and 240. So the options don't have 235. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere?\n\nWait, let me check the calculations again step by step. Maybe I messed up the total required.\n\nLet me recalculate the total required revenue. The profit needs to be at least 626,400. The total cost is 5040 *110. Let me confirm that again. 420 per month *12 months =5040 units. 5040 *110. Let's compute 5000*110=550,000 and 40*110=4,400. So total 554,400. That's correct. \n\nProfit = Revenue - 554,400 \u2265 626,400. So Revenue must be \u2265 626,400 +554,400 = 1,180,800. Correct. \n\nRevenue is S *5040. So S = 1,180,800 /5040. Let me compute that division again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps simplify the fraction. Let's see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 /504. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 24. 504 divided by 24 is 21. 118,080 divided by 24: 24*4920= 24*(4900+20)=24*4900=117,600 plus 24*20=480 \u2192 total 118,080. So yes, 118,080/24=4920. So now 4920/21. \n\n4920 divided by 21. Let me do this division again. 21 \u00d7 234 = 21*(200+34) = 4200 + 714 = 4914. 4920-4914=6. So 6/21 = 2/7. So the result is 234 and 2/7, which is approximately 234.2857. \n\nSo the minimum selling price has to be at least $234.2857 per component. Since the price must be such that the profit is at least the required amount, the price must be at least that value. Since the options are all whole numbers, the smallest possible option that's higher than 234.28 is 240, which is option C. Because 230 would be 230, which is less than 234.28, so insufficient. \n\nWait, but why is 240 the answer? Let me check the options again. The options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. So the calculated value is approximately $234.29. So the minimum price must be at least that. The smallest option above that is 240. \n\nWait, but perhaps I made an error in the calculation steps. Let me check again. Maybe there's a miscalculation in total units or costs. Let me recheck:\n\nMonthly production: 420 units. Yearly: 420 *12. 420*12: 400*12=4800, 20*12=240 \u2192 total 5040. Correct. \n\nProduction cost per unit $110. Total cost per year: 5040 *110. 5040*100 is 504,000; 5040*10 is 50,400. Total 554,400. Correct. \n\nProfit required is 626,400. So revenue needs to be 554,400 +626,400 =1,180,800. \n\nDivide by 5040: 1,180,800 /5040. Let me try dividing numerator and denominator by 5040. Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me divide both by 100 first. 1,180,800 \u00f7100 =11,808. 5040 \u00f7100 is 50.4. Hmm, maybe not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, 5040 \u00d7 234 = ?\n\nLet me compute 5040 \u00d7200 =1,008,000. 5040 \u00d734 = 5040*(30+4)= 151,200 +20,160 =171,360. So total 234 would be 1,008,000 +171,360 =1,179,360. \n\nBut the required revenue is 1,180,800. So 1,179,360 is 1,440 less. Therefore, 234 would give revenue 1,179,360, which is 1,440 less than needed. \n\nSo each additional dollar per component adds 5040 dollars to the revenue. So to cover the remaining 1,440, we need 1,440 /5040 = 0.2857 dollars. So total S must be 234.2857. \n\nTherefore, the minimal price must be at least that. Since the options are in whole dollars, you can't have fractions. So the minimum whole dollar price that meets or exceeds 234.2857 is 235. But none of the options are 235. The next higher option is 240 (C). \n\nSo the answer must be C)240. Because 230 would give S=230. Let me check that. \n\nIf S=230, then revenue is 5040 *230. Let's compute that. \n\n5040 *200 =1,008,000. 5040 *30 =151,200. Total is 1,008,000 +151,200 =1,159,200. \n\nSubtract the cost (554,400) gives profit of 1,159,200 -554,400 =604,800. But the required profit is 626,400, which is higher. So 230 gives a profit that's 21,600 short. \n\nSo 230 is insufficient. The next option is 240. Let's see:\n\n240 per unit. Revenue =5040 *240. \n\n5040 *200 =1,008,000; 5040*40=201,600. So total 1,008,000+201,600 =1,209,600. \n\nProfit: 1,209,600 -554,400 =655,200. Which is more than 626,400. So that works. \n\nTherefore, the minimum price is 240, which is option C. \n\nWait, but why isn't there an option for 234.29? The options are all integers, so the answer must be the next highest integer. Since 234.29 is the exact value, the minimum price must be $235, but since that's not an option, the next available is 240. So the answer is C.\n",

The profit equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Profit} = \\text{Revenue} - \\text{Cost} \\geq \\$626,400\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n5,040S - 554,400 \\geq 626,400\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( S \\):\n\n\\[\n5,040S \\geq 626,400 + 554,400 \\\\\n5,040S \\geq 1,180,800 \\\\\nS \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5,040} \\approx 234.29\n\\]\n\nSince the selling price must be a whole number and at least $234.29, the smallest valid option is **$240** (Option C). Checking lower options like $230 yields insufficient profit, while $240 meets the requirement.\n\nAnswer: C",
