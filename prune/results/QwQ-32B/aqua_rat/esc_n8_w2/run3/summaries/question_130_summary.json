      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about finding the percentage of the astronaut's weight on Venus compared to Earth. Hmm, so the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 on Venus. I need to figure out what percentage 182 is of 211.\n\nWait, right, percentage calculation. The formula is (Part/Whole) * 100. Here, the part is the Venus weight, and the whole is Earth's. So that's 182 divided by 211, multiplied by 100.\n\nLet me do the division first. 182 divided by 211. Let me think numerically. Let me try to approximate. Well, 211 times 0.8 is 168.8, because 200*0.8 is 160 and 11*0.8 is 8.8, so total 168.8. But 182 is higher than that. Hmm. How about 0.86 times 211? Let's see, 200*0.86 is 172, and 11*0.86 is about 9.46. Adding those gives 172 +9.46= 181.46. Oh, that's really close to 182. So 0.86 would give about 181.46, which is almost exactly the 182 given. So that's probably 86%, which is option D. \n\nWait, but let me check my calculation again to be sure. Let me do 182 divided by 211 more precisely. Let me write it out as a division. 182 \u00f7 211. Since 211 is bigger than 182, the result is less than 1. Let me compute this division. Let's see, 211 \u00d7 0.8 = 168.8, as before. Subtract that from 182: 182 - 168.8 =13.2. So remaining is 13.2. To find the decimal beyond 0.8, we can consider 13.2 /211. 211 \u00d70.06 is 12.66. So adding 0.06 gives 0.86, and 12.66. The remainder would be 13.2-12.66=0.54. So total so far is 0.86, and there's a little left. So 0.54/211 is about 0.00256. So total is approximately 0.8625, so around 86.25%, which would round to 86%. So option D is correct. \n\nThe options given are D)86%, so that's the answer. Let me check if any other options are close. The next option is C)70% which is way lower. So yeah, definitely D.\n",
