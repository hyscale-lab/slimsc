      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here about the average weight of oarsmen. Hmm, the question says that the average weight increases by 1.8 kg when one of them, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man. I need to find the weight of the new man. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the average weight of 10 oarsmen. Let me recall that average is total weight divided by the number of people. So originally, the total weight must have been 10 times the original average. Let me denote the original average as A. Then the total weight before the replacement was 10*A.\n\nNow, when they replace one of them, the new average becomes A + 1.8. The total number of people is still 10, right? Because they just replaced one, so the total remains the same. So the new total weight would be 10*(A + 1.8).\n\nThe difference between the new total and the old total should be the difference caused by replacing the 53 kg man with the new man. Let me see. The original total was 10A. The new total is 10*(A + 1.8) which is 10A + 18. So the total weight increased by 18 kg. \n\nWait, that makes sense because 10 people times 1.8 increase per person would be 10*1.8=18 kg total. So replacing the man caused an increase of 18 kg. \n\nBut how does that relate to the weights of the two men? The original man weighed 53 kg. The new man must weigh 53 plus the total increase, right? Because when you take out the original and put in the new one, the difference between them is what changes the total. Let me think again.\n\nThe total weight after replacement is (original total - 53) + new man's weight. The original total was 10A, so the new total is (10A -53 + x), where x is the new man's weight. \n\nWe know that the new total is also 10*(A +1.8). So setting those equal:\n\n10A -53 + x = 10A + 18 \n\nWait, because 10*(A +1.8) is 10A +18. So substituting that in:\n\n10A -53 +x = 10A +18 \n\nSubtract 10A from both sides:\n\n-53 + x = 18 \n\nSo then x = 18 +53 = 71 kg. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be 71, which is option A. Let me check if I did that right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it this way: the difference in total weight is the new man's weight minus the old man's weight. Since the total increased by 18 kg, then new man's weight is 53 + 18 = 71. That's the same result. So that's consistent. \n\nYes, that makes sense. The replacement caused an increase of 18 kg in total. So the new man must be 18 kg heavier than the one he replaced. Since the replaced man was 53, adding 18 gives 71. \n\nSo the correct answer should be A)71. Let me look at the options again. Option A is 71. Yep, that's the one.\n",

Hmm, so the original average goes up by 1.8 kg when they replace a 53 kg guy with someone new. I need to find the new man's weight. \n\nFirst, let me think about averages. The average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. Since there are 10 oarsmen, replacing one changes the total weight, which in turn affects the average.\n\nLet me denote the original total weight as T. The original average would be T/10. After replacing the 53 kg man with the new man, the new total weight becomes T - 53 + x, where x is the new man's weight. The new average is then (T -53 + x)/10. \n\nThe problem states that the average increased by 1.8 kg. So the new average is the original average plus 1.8. \n\nSetting up the equation: (T -53 + x)/10 = (T/10) + 1.8 \n\nHmm, let's solve this equation. Multiply both sides by 10 to eliminate denominators:\n\nT -53 + x = T + 18 \n\nWait, because 1.8 kg multiplied by 10 gives 18. \n\nNow subtract T from both sides: -53 + x = 18 \n\nThen, solving for x: x = 18 +53 = 71? \n\nWait, that would make the new man's weight 71 kg. Let me check the options. Option A is 71. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of the total increase. The average went up by 1.8 kg for 10 people, so the total weight increased by 1.8 *10 =18 kg. \n\nThe replacement caused this increase. The new man's weight must be 53 kg plus the total increase. Because when you take out 53 and put in x, the difference (x -53) must equal the total increase of 18. \n\nSo x -53 =18 \u2192 x=71. So that's the same answer. So the answer should be A)71. But wait, the options have A as 71. Let me check again. The problem says \"increased by 1.8 kg\", so the total increase is 18, so the new man adds 18 more than the old one. So yes, 53 +18=71. \n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. But why is option D 67? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check the steps. \n\nOriginal average: T/10. New average: (T -53 +x)/10. The difference between new and old is 1.8. \n\nSo [(T -53 +x)/10] - [T/10] = 1.8 \n\nWhich simplifies to ( -53 +x ) /10 = 1.8 \u2192 (-53 +x) = 18 \u2192 x=71. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is A. \n\nWait, but maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says the average is increased by 1.8 kg when replacing the 53kg crew member.
