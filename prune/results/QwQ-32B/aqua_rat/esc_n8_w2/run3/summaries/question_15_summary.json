      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this question here about rearranging the letters of the word \"PROBLEC\". The question is asking how many different 7-letter words can be made where none of the letters repeat. The options are given as A through E, with the answers being various factorials. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you want to find the number of ways to rearrange letters in a word, it's a permutation problem. Since all the letters are unique, right? Wait, the word here is \"PROBLEC\". Let me check each letter to make sure there are no duplicates. P, R, O, B, L, E, C. Yeah, that's seven distinct letters. Oh, wait, hold on. The word given is \"PROBLEC\". Let me count again: P (1), R (2), O (3), B (4), L (5), E (6), C (7). Yep, seven different letters. So each letter is unique. \n\nSo if all the letters are distinct, the number of possible rearrangements (permutations) should just be 7 factorial, which is 7! So that's 7\u00d76\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71. Looking at the options, option C is 7! and D is 8!. Since the word has exactly 7 letters, 7! makes sense. \n\nWait, but the question says \"none of the letters repeat\". Oh, but since all letters are already unique, any rearrangement won't have repeating letters. So the total number of permutations is indeed 7!.\n\nSo the answer should be C)7!.\n\nBut let me double-check. The options are A)2!, B)3!, C)7!, D)8!, E)9!. So yeah, 7! is the correct one here. The other options are way too small or big. 8! would be if there were 8 letters. So I think C is the right choice.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe word \"PROBLEC\" consists of 7 distinct letters. To find the number of ways to rearrange all 7 letters without any repetitions, we calculate the factorial of the number of letters, which is 7!. This is because each position in the 7-letter word can be filled by any of the remaining letters, leading to 7 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 1 permutations.
