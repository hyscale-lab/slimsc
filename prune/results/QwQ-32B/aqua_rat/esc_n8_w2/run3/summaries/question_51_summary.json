      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here where there's a money pouch with Rs. 700, and the number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins are all equal. I need to find out how many of each there are. The options are given, so maybe I can set up an equation and see which one fits.\n\nHmm, first, let's convert everything into the same units to make it easier. Since the total is in rupees, maybe I'll convert all the coins to rupees. Wait, 25 paise is 0.25 rupees, 50 paise is 0.50 rupees, and the one rupee coin is 1 rupee. \n\nLet me denote the number of each type of coin as 'n'. Since they are equal in number, each has 'n' coins. So, the total value contributed by each type would be:\n\n25 paise coins: 0.25 * n\n50 paise coins: 0.50 * n\n1 rupee coins: 1.00 * n\n\nAdding all these together should give the total of 700 rupees. So the equation would be:\n\n0.25n + 0.50n + 1.00n = 700\n\nLet me add those coefficients. 0.25 + 0.5 is 0.75, plus 1 gives 1.75. So 1.75n = 700. To find n, divide both sides by 1.75.\n\nCalculating that: 700 divided by 1.75. Hmm, let's see. Let me do the division step by step. 1.75 times 400 would be 700, because 1.75 * 400 = 700. Wait, wait, is that right?\n\nWait, 1.75 * 400. Let me compute that. 1.75 multiplied by 400: 1 times 400 is 400, and 0.75 times 400 is 300, so total is 700. Oh! So that means n is 400. So the answer would be option C, 400. Let me check the options again. Option C is 400, yes.\n\nWait, but let me verify again. Let me plug back in. If there are 400 of each:\n\n25 paise coins: 400 * 0.25 = 100 rupees\n50 paise coins: 400 * 0.5 = 200 rupees\n1 rupee coins: 400 *1 = 400 rupees\nTotal: 100 + 200 + 400 = 700. Perfect, that adds up exactly. So the answer must be C)400.\n",
