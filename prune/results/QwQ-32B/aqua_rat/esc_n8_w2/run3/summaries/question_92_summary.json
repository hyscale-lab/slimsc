      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about the telephone bill which has a fixed part and a variable part based on the number of calls. Hmm, I need to find the bill when 500 calls are made. Let's see. The question gives two data points: when there were 540 calls, the bill was 1800 rupees, and when there were 620 calls, it was 2040. Then they want to know for 500 calls. \n\nAlright, this sounds like a linear equation problem. The total bill would be fixed cost plus variable cost per call times the number of calls. So the formula should be something like Total = Fixed + (Variable rate * number of calls). Let me denote the fixed cost as F and the variable rate per call as R. \n\nSo, for the first month: 1800 = F + 540R. Second month: 2040 = F + 620R. Now I need to solve these two equations to find F and R. \n\nSubtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F. Let's see: 2040 - 1800 = (F +620R) - (F +540R). That gives 240 = 80R. So R would be 240 divided by 80, which is 3. Wait, so R is 3 rupees per call?\n\nWait, let me check that again. 2040 minus 1800 is 240. The difference in calls is 620-540=80. So 80R = 240 \u2192 R=3. Yeah that's correct. \n\nNow plug back R into one of the equations to find F. Let's take the first one: 1800 = F + 540*3. 540*3 is 1620. So F = 1800-1620 = 180. So fixed cost is 180 rupees. \n\nSo now, for 500 calls, the total bill would be F + 500*R. That's 180 + 500*3. Let's compute that: 500*3 is 1500, plus 180 is 1680. So the answer should be B) 1680? \n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me confirm with the second data point. If R is 3 and F is 180, then 620 calls would be 180 + 620*3. 620*3 is 1860, plus 180 is 2040, which matches. So that's correct. \n\nSo when 500 calls are made, the bill is 180 + 1500 = 1680. So option B is the right answer. I think that's it.\n",

Alright, I need to find the fixed cost and the variable cost per call first, right?\n\nLet me think. The total bill is fixed plus variable.

And the second month: 2040 = F + 620V. Now, I can set up these two equations and solve for F and V. \n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second should eliminate F. Let's see: 2040 - 1800 = (F +620V) - (F +540V). That gives 240 = 80V. So V would be 240 divided by 80, which is 3. Wait, so variable cost per call is 3 rupees?\n\nLet me check that again. 620 -540 is 80 calls, and the difference in bill is 240. 240 divided by 80 is indeed 3. So V is 3. \n\nNow plug back into one of the equations to find F. Let's take the first one: 1800 = F +540*3. 540 times 3 is 1620. So F = 1800 - 1620 = 180. So fixed cost is 180 rupees. \n\nWait, let's confirm with the second equation. 620 calls: 620*3 is 1860. Adding fixed 180 gives 1860 +180 = 2040. Which matches the given value. Okay that's correct.\n\nNow, the question is for 500 calls. So total bill would be F +500V. That's 180 + 500*3. 500*3 is 1500, plus 180 is 1680. So the answer should be option B, 1680. Let me check the options again. Option B is 1680. So that's the one. I think that's right. \n\nWait, the problem mentions \"500 units are consumed due to more holidays.\" Oh, the wording says \"units\" here but earlier it was \"calls\". Maybe that's a typo, but since the problem uses calls in the first two instances, I assume units here refers to calls. So 500 calls. Yep, so the calculation is correct. So the answer is B.\n",
