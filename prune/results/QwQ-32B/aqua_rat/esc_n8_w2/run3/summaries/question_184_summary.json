      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question says, \"A number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Find the number.\" Hmm, I need to find a number such that the difference between this number and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and this number. \n\nWait, so let me parse that again. The number is greater than 36 by some amount, and less than 86 by the same amount. Oh right, so the amount it's greater than 36 should equal the amount it's less than 86. So the distance from 36 to the number is the same as the distance from the number to 86. That makes me think the number is exactly halfway between 36 and 86. Because if the distances are equal, it's the midpoint.\n\nSo maybe I can calculate the average of 36 and 86. The formula for the midpoint between two numbers is (a + b)/2. Let me do that. 36 plus 86 equals... 122? Wait, 36 + 80 is 116, plus 6 more is 122. Then divide by 2, so 122 divided by 2 is 61. So the number should be 61. Let me check the options. Option D is 61. \n\nWait, let me verify. If the number is 61, then 61 - 36 is 25. And 86 - 61 is also 25. Yes, that works. So the answer must be D)61. Let me look at the options again to make sure I didn't misread. The options are A)60, B)56, C)51, D)61, E)41. Yep, D is there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up an equation to confirm. Let the number be x. The problem states that the amount by which x is greater than 36 is equal to the amount by which it is less than 86. So, x - 36 = 86 - x. Solving that equation: x -36 =86 -x. Adding x to both sides gives 2x -36 =86. Then add 36 to both sides: 2x = 122. So x is 61. Yep, that matches the earlier calculation. So definitely D is correct. The other options don't fit. For example, if I took 60 (option A), then 60-36=24 and 86-60=26. Not equal. 56: 56-36=20, 86-56=30. Nope. 51: difference 15 vs 35. 41: 5 vs 45. So only 61 works. So answer D.\n",
