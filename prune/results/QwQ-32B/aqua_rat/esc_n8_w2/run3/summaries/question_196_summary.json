      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about an electric pole and a tree's shadow. Let me see... The question says that an electric pole that's 14 meters high casts a shadow of 10 meters. Then they want to find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters under the same conditions. The options are A to E, with numbers like 21, 22, etc. \n\nHmm, right, this seems like a proportion problem. Because when the sun's angle is the same, the ratio of the object's height to its shadow length should be the same for both objects. So like, the pole's height over its shadow equals the tree's height over its shadow. That makes sense because similar triangles, right?\n\nLet me write that down. Let me denote the height of the tree as h. So, setting up the proportion: 14 meters (pole height) divided by 10 meters (pole shadow) equals h (tree height) divided by 15 meters (tree shadow). So the equation is 14/10 = h/15. \n\nNow I need to solve for h. To do that, I can cross-multiply. So 14 times 15 equals 10 times h. Let me compute 14*15. Hmm, 14*10 is 140, and 14*5 is 70, so adding those gives 210. So 210 = 10h. Then divide both sides by 10, so h is 210 divided by 10, which is 21. \n\nWait, that would make the tree 21 meters tall. Looking at the options, option A is 21. So the answer should be A?\n\nLet me double-check. If the shadow is longer, the tree must be taller than the pole. The pole's shadow is 10, tree's 15, which is 1.5 times longer (since 15 is 1.5 times 10). So the height should also be 1.5 times the pole's height. 14 multiplied by 1.5... 14*1 is 14, 14*0.5 is 7, so 14+7=21. Yep, that matches. So that seems right. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here. The key is that the ratios are the same because the sunlight makes similar triangles. So the answer is A)21.\n",

We need to find the height of a tree that casts a 15-meter shadow under the same conditions. Hmm, right, this should be a similar triangles problem, right? Because the sun's angle would create similar triangles with the objects and their shadows.\n\nSo the idea is that the ratio of the height to the shadow length should be the same for both the pole and the tree.
