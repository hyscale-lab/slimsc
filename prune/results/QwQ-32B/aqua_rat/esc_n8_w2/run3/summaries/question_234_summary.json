      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is about simple interest. Let me see. The professors took a loan of 5000 rupees from the university. After 3 years, the interest they paid was 300. We need to find the annual interest rate. Hmm, right.\n\nI remember the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P the principal, R the rate, and T the time in years. So here, we have to find R. Let me plug in the numbers.\n\nThe interest here is 300, the principal is 5000, time is 3 years. So rearranging the formula to solve for R: R = I / (P * T). Let me calculate that. \n\nSo 300 divided by (5000 multiplied by 3). Let me compute the denominator first. 5000 times 3 is 15,000. Then 300 divided by 15,000. Let me do that division. 300 divided by 15,000 equals... Well, 15,000 divided by 100 is 150, so 300 is 2 times 150. So 2/100, which is 0.02. So that's 2%. \n\nWait, so the rate would be 2% per annum. Let me check the options. Option A is 2%, so that must be the answer. Wait, but let me double-check my math. \n\nLet me do the division again. 300 divided by 15,000. Let's see, 15,000 divided by 100 is 150, so 1% is 150. So 300 is double that, so 2%. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be A) 2%.\n",

Where I is the interest, P the principal, R the rate, and T the time in years. So here, the interest is 300, principal is 5000, time is 3 years. We have to find R.\n\nPlugging the numbers into the formula: 300 = (5000 * R * 3)/100. Let me compute the right side first. Let's see, 5000 multiplied by 3 is 15000. So that's 15000*R divided by 100.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't mess up.\n\nLet me recalculate. 5000 at 2% for 3 years. So each year's interest would be 5000 * 0.02 = 100. Over three years that's 300. Yep, that matches. So the answer must be A)2%. But hold on, the options include 2% as A, so that's correct. Hmm, but why is there an option E? Maybe a trick? Wait, is there any chance I mixed up simple and compound interest? The question says simple interest, so no. So I think the correct answer is A. So the answer is A.\n",
