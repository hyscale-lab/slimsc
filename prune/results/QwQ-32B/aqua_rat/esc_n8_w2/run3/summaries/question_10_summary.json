      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The question is about figuring out how many $250 sales a salesperson needs to make to get a salary of at least $1000 with a 10% commission on each sale. Hmm, right.\n\nSo first, the commission per sale. Since it's 10%, that would be 10% of $250. Let me calculate that. 10% of 250 is 0.10 multiplied by 250, which is 25. So each sale gives him $25 commission. \n\nNow, he wants his total commission to be at least $1000. So the total commission is the number of sales multiplied by $25. Let me write that as an equation. Let\u2019s call the number of sales 'x'. Then, 25x \u2265 1000. To find the minimum x, I need to solve for x here.\n\nDividing both sides by 25: x \u2265 1000 /25. Let me do that division. 1000 divided by 25. Well, 25 times 40 is 1000, right? Because 25*4=100, so 25*40=1000. So x has to be at least 40. Wait, but let me check the options. Option D is 40. So that would be the answer? \n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, the question says \"salary of at least $1000\". Is the commission his entire salary? The way the question is phrased, \"a sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales... to reach a salary of at least $1000?\" So I think the salary here refers to the total commission he earns. Because otherwise, if he had a base salary plus commission, the problem would have mentioned that. Since it's not mentioned, probably the commission is his entire earnings. \n\nSo yeah, each sale gives $25, so 40 sales would give exactly $1000. But the question says \"at least $1000\". So 40 would be exactly 1000, which meets the requirement. So 40 is the minimum. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 40. So that's the answer. Let me check the options again. The options are A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52. So D is correct. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the math. 25 times 40 is indeed 1000. So if he makes 40 sales of $250 each, each gives $25, so total is 40*25=1000. So yes, that's exactly the target. Since they want at least 1000, 40 is the minimum number. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option E)52? Maybe a common mistake would be to miscalculate. Like maybe someone thought 10% of 250 is 25, but then thought 25*40 is 1000, so that's correct. Alternatively, maybe someone might have messed up the percentage? Like thinking 10% of 200 is 20, but no, the question is 250. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the commission is in addition to a base salary? But the problem doesn't mention a base. The way it's worded: \"gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales... to reach a salary of at least $1000?\" So \"salary\" here probably refers to the total earnings from commissions. Because otherwise, if there was a base, the problem would need to state that. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D)40. I think that's right.\n",

So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of sales of $250 each, but the commission is 10% of the total sales? Wait, that's the same thing. Because each sale is $250, so each sale's commission is 10% of that. So total commission is 0.1*(250*n) = 25n. Yep, same as before. So yeah, 40 is correct. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 40, so that should be the answer. Let me check the other options to see if any could be a trap. For example, if someone thought 10% of 250 is 25, but then maybe they thought the total sales need to be $1000, which would be different.
