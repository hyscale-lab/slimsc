      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the population increase over the last year based on the given information. Hmm, the problem says that Boomtown's population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. And if that happens, the population in two years will be exactly double what it was one year ago. So I have to find the percentage increase from last year to now. \n\nLet me try to set up some variables here. Let me denote the population one year ago as P. Then, the current population would be something, right? Wait, the question is about the increase over the last year. So maybe I should think in terms of time points. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nLet me define the population one year ago as P. Let's say that one year ago was time t = 0, now is t = 1, and the next two years are t = 2 and t = 3? Wait, maybe I need to adjust the timeline. Wait, the problem says \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So two years from now is t = 2 (since now is t=0?), maybe I need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the current population as C. Then, one year ago, the population was some value, let's call it X. The problem states that the increase over the last year is what we need to find. So from one year ago (X) to now (C), so the increase is (C - X)/X * 100%, which is the percentage we need to find.\n\nThe future projections are that each of the next two years (so from now to next year, and then the year after that) will have a 10% increase. So the population in one year from now would be C * 1.10, and then in two years, it would be (C * 1.10) * 1.10 = C*(1.1)^2.\n\nThe problem states that this two-year future population (C*(1.1)^2) is exactly double the population one year ago (X). So:\n\nC*(1.1)^2 = 2X\n\nWe need to find (C - X)/X *100%, which is the percentage increase from X to C. Let's see.\n\nSo let's rearrange the equation:\n\nC / X = 2 / (1.1)^2 \n\nWait, because if C*(1.1)^2 = 2X, then dividing both sides by (1.1)^2 and then by X gives C/X = 2/(1.1)^2. \n\nWait, so C/X is the ratio of current population to last year's population. The increase is (C - X)/X = (C/X - 1). \n\nSo let's compute 2/(1.1)^2 first. Let me calculate 1.1 squared. 1.1 *1.1 is 1.21. So 2 divided by 1.21 is approximately 2 /1.21. Let me do that division. 1.21 times 1.65 is roughly 2? Let's see: 1.21 * 1.6 = 1.936, which is close to 2. Hmm, maybe exact calculation.\n\nWait 2 divided by 1.21 equals:\n\nLet me compute 2 / 1.21. Let me write that as 200 / 121. Let me divide 200 by 121. 121*1.65 = 121*(1 + 0.6 + 0.05) = 121 + 72.6 + 6.05 = 199.65. So 121*1.65 \u2248199.65, which is very close to 200. So 200/121 is approximately 1.65289... So approximately 1.6529. \n\nTherefore, C/X \u22481.6529. So the ratio of current to last year's population is about 1.6529, so the increase is (1.6529 -1) = 0.6529, which is 65.29%. So the closest option would be D)65%.\n\nWait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't flip anything. Let me retrace.\n\nThe equation was C*(1.1)^2 = 2X. So solving for C/X = 2/(1.1)^2. So that gives the current population over the previous year's population. \n\nSo the increase from X to C is (C - X)/X = (C/X -1) = (2/(1.21) -1) = (1.65289 -1) = 0.65289, so 65.289%, so yes, that's 65% approximately. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 65%, which is the closest. The options are A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%. So 65% is the closest. So the answer should be D.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the timeline. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe question says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So two years from now's population is 2 times the population one year ago. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me define variables more clearly:\n\nLet\u2019s let the population one year ago be P. Then, the current population (now) is P*(1 + r), where r is the growth rate over the last year (the value we need to find). \n\nThe population next year will be current *1.1 = P*(1 + r)*1.1. \n\nThen, two years from now it will be that *1.1 again, so P*(1 + r)*(1.1)^2.\n\nAccording to the problem, that equals 2P (since it's double the population one year ago, which is P). \n\nSo equation:\n\nP*(1 + r)*(1.1)^2 = 2P\n\nDivide both sides by P:\n\n(1 + r)*(1.21) = 2\n\nSo, 1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289\n\nSo r \u2248 0.65289, which is 65.289%, so yes, 65% is the closest. So D is correct.\n\nWait, so that's exactly the same as before. So the answer is D. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D)65%.\n",

If that happens, then the population in two years will be double the population from one year ago. I have to find the percentage increase over the last year. Wait, so the question is asking for the growth rate from last year to now, right? Because the problem mentions the population two years from now being double the population from a year ago. \n\nLet me try to set up some variables here. Let me think. Let's denote the population one year ago as P. Then, the current population would be P multiplied by (1 + the growth rate last year). Wait, but the problem is asking for the percent increase over the last year. Let me clarify: Let me define variables step by step.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say that the population one year ago was P. \n\nThe current population (now) is then P multiplied by (1 + r), where r is the growth rate last year (which we need to find). \n\nThen, next year, the population would increase by 10%, so that would be current population * 1.10. \n\nThen, two years from now, it would be that amount times 1.10 again. \n\nAccording to the problem, the population two years from now equals double the population of one year ago. \n\nSo putting that into equations:\n\nPopulation two years from now = 2 * P \n\nThe two-year growth starting from now is 10% each year. \n\nSo, starting from current population (which is P*(1 + r)), after one year it's P*(1 + r)*1.10, then after the second year, it's P*(1 + r)*(1.10)^2. \n\nSo the equation is:\n\nP*(1 + r)*(1.1)^2 = 2*P \n\nWe can divide both sides by P to simplify:\n\n(1 + r)*(1.21) = 2 \n\nSo then, solving for (1 + r):\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \n\nCalculating 2 divided by 1.21. Let me compute that. 1.21 times 1.65 is about 2, right? Because 1.21*1.6 is 1.936, and 1.21*1.65 is 1.21*(1.6 +0.05) = 1.936 +0.0605 = 1.9965, which is close to 2.

Let me compute 2 / 1.21.\n\nAlternatively, 1.21 is 121/100. So 2 divided by (121/100) is 2*(100/121) = 200/121. Let me calculate that.\n\n200 divided by 121. Let's see, 121 \u00d7 1.65 is 121 \u00d7 1.6 + 121 \u00d70.05. 121\u00d71.6 is 193.6, and 121\u00d70.05 is 6.05. Adding those gives 199.65. Which is close to 200.

So 65 is closer. \n\nTherefore the answer is D. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the variable setup. Let me check again. Suppose that the current population is now, so the population a year ago was P. The current population is P*(1 + r). Then, next year it becomes that *1.1, then next year again, so total two years from now: (current) *1.1^2. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the timeline. Let me think of time steps. \n\nLet me assign time points:\n\n- Let\u2019s say \"one year ago\" is time t = -1, current time is t=0, next year t=1, and two years from now is t=2. \n\nPopulation at t = -1: P. \n\nPopulation at t=0: P*(1 + r). \n\nPopulation at t=1: (P*(1 + r)) *1.1 \n\nPopulation at t=2: (P*(1 + r)*1.1) *1.1 = P*(1 + r)* (1.1)^2 \n\nThe problem states that the population at t=2 is double that of t=-1. So:\n\nP*(1 + r)*(1.21) = 2P \u2192 same equation. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. \n\nThus the percentage increase is approximately 65.29%, so closest to 65%, which is option D. \n\nSo the answer must be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's define the population one year ago as \\( P \\). The current population is then \\( P \\times (1 + r) \\), where \\( r \\) is the population growth rate over the past year. The projected population after two years (increasing by 10% annually) will be:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Population in two years} = P \\times (1 + r) \\times (1.10)^2\n\\]\n\nAccording to the problem, this future population equals double the population from one year ago:\n\n\\[\nP \\times (1 + r) \\times (1.10)^2 = 2P\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\n(1 + r) \\times 1.21 = 2\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( r \\):\n\n\\[\n1 + r = \\frac{2}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289\n\\]\n\\[\nr \\approx 0.65289 \\quad (\\text{or } 65.29\\%)\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to \\( 65.29\\% \\) is **65%** (Option D).\n\nAnswer: D",
