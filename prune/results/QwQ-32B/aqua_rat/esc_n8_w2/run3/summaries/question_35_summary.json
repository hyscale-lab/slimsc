      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a rectangular solid that's inscribed in a sphere. The dimensions of the solid are 3 x 4 x 15. The question is asking for the diameter of the sphere. Hmm, right. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, when a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, all its vertices lie on the sphere's surface. That means the sphere's diameter should be equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid. Because the diagonal would stretch from one corner of the solid to the opposite corner, passing through the center of the sphere. So the length of that diagonal would be the diameter, right?\n\nOh right, the formula for the space diagonal of a rectangular prism (which is what a rectangular solid is) is given by the square root of the sum of the squares of its length, width, and height. So the formula is sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2). Let me confirm that. Yeah, I remember that in 3D, the space diagonal d is calculated that way. So substituting the given dimensions here.\n\nThe dimensions are 3, 4, and 15. Let me plug those into the formula. So that would be sqrt(3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 + 15\u00b2). Let me compute each term:\n\n3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, and 15 squared is 225. Adding those up: 9 + 16 = 25, then 25 + 225 = 250. Wait, so the diagonal is sqrt(250). Let me calculate that.\n\nHmm, sqrt(250). Let's see, sqrt(25*10) is 5*sqrt(10). Because 25 times 10 is 250. So sqrt(250) = 5*sqrt(10). What's the numerical value of that? Since sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623, so multiplying by 5 gives 15.8115. Wait, that's close to option B, which is 15.8113. The slight difference might be due to rounding. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, hold on. The problem states the dimensions as 3 x 4 x 15. Let me re-calculate the squares again. 3 squared is definitely 9, 4 squared is 16, 15 squared is 225. Adding them: 9 + 16 = 25, plus 225 gives 250. So sqrt(250) is correct. So sqrt(250) is indeed 5*sqrt(10). Let me check sqrt(10) more precisely. The square root of 10 is approximately 3.16227766017. So 5 times that is 5 * 3.16227766017 = 15.8113883008. So that rounds to 15.8114, which matches option B's 15.8113. The difference is probably due to the number of decimal places used in the calculation here.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's dimensions. Let me check again. The question says a rectangular solid 3 x 4 x 15. Yes, that's correct. So the space diagonal is sqrt(3\u00b2 +4\u00b2 +15\u00b2) = sqrt(250). So the diameter of the sphere must be this value. So the answer should be B) 15.8113. \n\nLet me just make sure that the sphere's diameter is indeed equal to the space diagonal. Since all the vertices are on the sphere, the center of the sphere is the center of the rectangular solid. The maximum distance between any two vertices would be the space diagonal, which must be the diameter. Yeah, that makes sense. So there's no other way here. I think the answer is B.\n",

Because the diagonal would stretch from one corner of the solid to the opposite corner, passing through the center of the sphere. So the length of that diagonal would be the same as the diameter of the sphere. \n\nSo the key here is to calculate the space diagonal of the rectangular solid with the given dimensions. The formula for the space diagonal of a rectangular prism (which is what a rectangular solid is) is derived from the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. The formula is:\n\nDiagonal = \u221a(length\u00b2 + width\u00b2 + height\u00b2)\n\nLet me confirm that formula. Yeah, I think that's right. For a box with sides a, b, c, the space diagonal d is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). \n\nSo plugging in the given dimensions: 3, 4, and 15. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst, 3 squared is 9. Then 4 squared is 16. 15 squared is 225. Adding those together: 9 + 16 = 25, then 25 + 225 = 250. So the diagonal would be the square root of 250. \n\nWait, let me check that again. 3^2 is 9, 4^2 is 16, 15^2 is 225. Adding those gives 9 + 16 = 25, then 25 + 225 is 250. So sqrt(250). \n\nHmm, sqrt(250) can be simplified. Let's see, 250 is 25 times 10. So sqrt(25*10) = 5*sqrt(10). Since sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623, multiplying that by 5 gives 5 * 3.1623 = 15.8115. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 15.8113. That's really close. The slight difference might be due to rounding. Let me check if I did everything right. \n\nWait, the question says the solid is 3 x 4 x 15. So the edges are 3,4,15. The space diagonal formula is correct, right? Let me think again. The space diagonal is calculated by taking the square root of (length squared plus width squared plus height squared). Yes, that's right. \n\nSo 3 squared is 9, 4 squared 16, 15 squared 225. Total sum is 250. Square root of 250 is indeed 5 times root 10. And 5 times 3.16227766 is approximately 15.8113883. Which rounds to 15.8114, but the option B is 15.8113. Maybe they used a slightly different approximation for sqrt(10). Let me compute sqrt(10) more precisely. \n\nsqrt(10) is approximately 3.16227766017. So 5 times that is 15.8113883008. So rounding to four decimal places, that would be 15.8114. But the option B is given as 15.8113, which is just one in the fourth decimal. Maybe the problem expects an exact form, but the options are all decimals. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps?\n\nWait, let me check the problem again. The question says the solid is 3x4x15. So the edges are 3,4,15. The space diagonal is sqrt(3\u00b2 +4\u00b2 +15\u00b2) = sqrt(9 +16 +225) = sqrt(250). So that's correct. Therefore the diameter of the sphere must be sqrt(250), which is approximately 15.8114. So the closest option is B, 15.8113. The slight discrepancy might be due to rounding during the calculation steps in the problem's options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the dimensions? Let me check again. 3,4,15. Yeah, that's the given. So I think that's right. The answer must be B. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me think if there's another way this could be approached. Maybe someone might confuse the face diagonal with the space diagonal? Like, if you take the 3 and 4 first, the face diagonal would be 5 (since 3-4-5 triangle), then combine that with 15. So sqrt(5\u00b2 +15\u00b2) = sqrt(25 +225)=sqrt(250) same as before. So that's the same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might have added the edges instead of using the diagonal? But that would give 3+4+15=22, which is not among the options. So no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the radius instead of the diameter? But the options don't have half of that. sqrt(250) is the diameter, so radius would be half of that, which would be around 7.9, which is not listed. So that's not the case. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is B) 15.8113.\n",
