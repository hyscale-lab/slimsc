      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade after 30 seconds. The fan is rotating at 300 revolutions per minute, and the point is 10 cm from the center. Hmm, right. \n\nFirst, I remember that distance traveled in circular motion is related to the circumference and the number of revolutions. The formula for circumference is 2\u03c0r, right? So the circumference here would be 2 * \u03c0 * 10 cm, which is 20\u03c0 cm per revolution. \n\nBut wait, the fan's speed is given in revolutions per minute, and the time is in seconds. I need to convert the time or the rate to match. Let me think. The question says 30 seconds, so maybe convert that to minutes? 30 seconds is half a minute. Alternatively, convert the RPM to revolutions per second. Let's do that.\n\n300 revolutions per minute divided by 60 seconds gives revolutions per second. 300/60 = 5. So the fan makes 5 revolutions each second. \n\nNow, over 30 seconds, that's 5 * 30 = 150 revolutions total. \n\nThen, each revolution is 20\u03c0 cm. Multiply the number of revolutions by the circumference: 150 * 20\u03c0. Let me calculate that. 150 times 20 is 3000, so 3000\u03c0 cm. Wait, but looking at the options, D is 3000\u03c0. Hmm, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might mix up something.\n\nWait, the radius is 10 cm. The circumference is indeed 2\u03c0r = 20\u03c0. So that's correct. The RPM is 300, so per second 5. 30 seconds gives 150 revolutions. 150 * 20\u03c0 = 3000\u03c0. So that would be answer D. \n\nBut hold on, let me check the options again. The options include 750\u03c0, 1500, 1875, 3000, 7500. So D is an option here. Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the time conversion? Let me recalculate. \n\n30 seconds is 0.5 minutes. So 300 RPM * 0.5 minutes = 150 revolutions. Yep, same as before. So 150 times circumference (20\u03c0) gives 3000\u03c0. So the answer should be D. But wait, I recall sometimes when they say \"distance traveled\" they mean the arc length, which is the same as circumference multiplied by revolutions. So that's exactly what I did. \n\nHmm, but maybe I messed up the radius vs diameter? Wait, the question says 10 centimeters from the center, so that's the radius. So the circumference is correct. Okay. So I think D is correct. Let me check the options again. The options given are A to E, and D is 3000\u03c0. So I think that's the right answer.\n",

So 150 revolutions in 30 seconds.\n\nThen, the total distance traveled would be the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference. So that's 150 * 20\u03c0.

Yes, that's the radius. So circumference is correct. The time conversion is correct. 30 seconds is half a minute, so half of 300 is 150. Yeah. So 150 times circumference. 150 *20\u03c0 =3000\u03c0. So the answer must be D. Hmm, but I'm a bit surprised because sometimes people might confuse linear speed with angular, but in this case, the question is straightforward. I think that's right.\n",
