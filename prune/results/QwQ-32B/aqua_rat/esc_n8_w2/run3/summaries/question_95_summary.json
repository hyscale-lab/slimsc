      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the newspaper costs $4 on Sundays and $1 on other days. The hotel buys twice as many papers on Sunday compared to the other days. Wait, the wording here is a bit tricky. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Oh right, so the \"rest of the days\" probably refers to each of the other six days. Wait, maybe it's the total for all the other days combined? Or per day? That's a crucial point. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nWait, the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The phrasing here might mean that the number of papers on Sunday is twice the number they buy on the other days. But does \"the rest of the days\" refer to each day or all the days combined? Hmm, that's ambiguous. But usually in such problems, when they say \"twice as many on Sunday as the rest of the days\", it's likely that the Sunday number is twice the average of the other days, or maybe twice the total for the other days? Wait, maybe I need to rephrase the sentence.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hotel buys the same number of papers each day except Sunday, and on Sunday it's twice that number. For example, let's say the hotel buys x papers each day from Monday to Saturday, and on Sunday buys 2x. That interpretation makes sense because \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\" \u2014 so the rest of the days would be each day's amount. Let me see. Let's define variables.\n\nLet me define variables properly. Let me assume that from Monday to Saturday, the hotel buys x newspapers each day. Then, on Sunday, it buys twice as many as the other days. Wait, does that mean twice the daily amount (so 2x) or twice the total of all the other days? Hmm, the wording says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The \"rest of the days of the week\" would be the total for all other days. Wait, maybe that's the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the phrasing is \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The \"rest of the days of the week\" would be the total for the other six days. So if the hotel buys, say, Y papers on Sunday, then Y = 2*(sum of papers from Monday to Saturday). But that might be another interpretation. Hmm, now I'm confused between two possibilities:\n\nOption 1: The number of papers on Sunday is twice the number bought on each of the other days. So if each non-Sunday day has x papers, then Sunday has 2x.\n\nOption 2: The number of papers on Sunday is twice the total of all the other days combined. So Sunday's papers = 2*(sum of Monday to Saturday).\n\nThe question is which interpretation is correct based on the wording. The problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The key is \"as it does the rest of the days\"\u2014 the \"rest of the days\" probably refers to the total over those days, not per day. So the second interpretation might be correct. Let me check.\n\nSuppose that. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let S be the number of papers bought on Sunday.\n\nLet T be the total number bought on the other six days (Monday to Saturday). Then according to the problem, S = 2*T. Because \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\".\n\nSo total papers per week would be S + T = 2T + T = 3T. But the cost is given, so maybe we can set up an equation with the cost.\n\nThe cost on Sunday is $4 per paper, so Sunday's cost is 4*S.\n\nThe cost on other days is $1 per paper, so the total cost for the other days is 1*T (since T is the total papers on those days).\n\nTotal weekly cost is 4S + T = 210. But since S = 2T, substituting gives 4*(2T) + T = 8T + T =9T = 210. Wait, 9T = 210? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, if S = 2T, then 4S + T = 4*(2T) + T = 8T + T =9T. So 9T =210. Then T would be 210/9 \u2248 23.333, but that's a fraction, which can't be since the number of papers must be an integer. Hmm, that's a problem. That suggests maybe my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my first interpretation was correct. Let me try that approach again.\n\nFirst interpretation: Let\u2019s suppose that the hotel buys x papers each day from Monday to Saturday, and on Sunday buys twice that amount, so 2x.\n\nThen, the total number of papers on Sunday is 2x, and each of the other days is x. So total papers for the week would be Sunday (2x) plus 6 days (each x) \u2192 2x + 6x =8x.\n\nThe cost would be:\n\nSunday cost: 2x papers * $4 =8x.\n\nThe other days: 6x papers * $1 each =6x.\n\nTotal cost: 8x +6x =14x. Set that equal to $210. So 14x=210 \u2192 x=15. Then, the number bought on Monday (which is one of the non-Sundays) would be x=15, so answer A)15?\n\nBut the options include 15 as option A, but let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me see. The problem's options have A)15 and B)30, so maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but if x is 15, then Sunday would have 30 papers. Let me check the total cost again.\n\nSunday's cost: 30 *4 =120.\n\nOther days: 6*15=90 papers, costing 90*1=90. Total 210. That adds up. So that works. So the answer would be 15, which is option A. But wait, the options given include B)30, which is twice 15. Maybe I need to see if the question is asking for the number bought on Monday, which is x=15. So the answer would be A)15. But let me check again the problem's wording to confirm.\n\nWait, the question says: \"how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\" Since Monday is a non-Sunday day, it would be x, which is 15. So answer A. But the options have B)30. Hmm, but maybe I made an error in the setup. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". Wait, in this first interpretation, the \"rest of the days\" would be the other six days, but the \"as it does the rest of the days\" \u2014 perhaps the wording implies that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. Because if \"the rest of the days\" is plural, maybe each day's amount? But in that case, Sunday is twice each of the other days. So that would be correct. So in that case, the setup is correct, and the answer is A)15.\n\nBut why is there an option B)30? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nWait the problem says \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". So maybe \"the rest of the days of the week\" refers to each of the other days. So the number on Sunday is twice the number ordered on each of the other days. So if on each non-Sunday day they buy x, then Sunday is 2x. So the first approach is correct. Then Monday's papers are x =15, so answer A.\n\nBut the options have B as 30, which would be Sunday's papers. But the question is about Monday, so A is correct. So why am I confused?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem was interpreted the other way. Let me try the second approach again, where \"twice as many on Sunday as the rest of the days combined\".\n\nIn that case, let me set variables again. Let T be the total number of papers bought on the other six days. So Sunday's papers S = 2*T. Then total cost is 4*S +1*T =4*(2T) + T =9T =210 \u2192 T=210/9 \u224823.333. Not an integer. Which is impossible, so that can't be right. Therefore, the first interpretation must be correct. So the answer should be A)15. But let me check the options again. The options are A)15, B)30, etc. So the answer would be A. Hmm, but maybe I made an error in the cost calculation?\n\nWait, let me recheck:\n\nIf x is the number per day from Monday to Saturday, then each of those days is x papers. So 6 days: 6x papers. Sunday is 2x papers.\n\nCost for Sunday: 2x * $4 = 8x.\n\nCost for other days: 6x * $1 =6x.\n\nTotal cost: 8x +6x =14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday is x=15. So the answer is A)15. So why is there an option B)30? Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me read the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The \"rest of the days of the week\"\u2014does that mean each day or all days combined? The problem could be interpreted as \"twice as many on Sunday as on each of the other days\", which would make the first approach correct. Alternatively, if it's \"twice as many as the total for the other days\", then that would be the second approach. But since the second approach gives a non-integer, which is impossible, the first approach must be correct, leading to answer A.\n\nWait, but the options have B as 30. Maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. Oh! Wait a second. The problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The phrase \"the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014could that be referring to each day's order? Like, on each non-Sunday day, the hotel orders x, so Sunday is twice that, so 2x. That's what I did before. So the Monday count is x, so 15. So answer A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the rest of the days of the week\" refers to all the other days collectively. So Sunday's order is twice the total of all the other days. Let me try that again with that interpretation. Let me call the total number bought on other days (Monday-Saturday) as T. Then Sunday's is 2T. So total cost would be 4*(2T) + 1*T =9T=210. Then T =210/9 \u224823.333, which is not an integer. Since you can't buy a fraction of a newspaper, this must not be the correct interpretation. So the first interpretation must be right, leading to answer A. So why is option B there? Maybe I made a mistake in variables.\n\nWait another thought: maybe the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\"\u2014so the number on Sunday is twice the number it buys on each of the other days. So if the other days are each x, then Sunday is 2x. So Monday is x, which is 15. So the answer is A. So the options are correct, so the answer is A.\n\nHmm, but why is there an option B? Let me check the problem again. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the cost.\n\nWait, let's recalculate with x=15:\n\nSunday: 2x =30 papers, costing 30 *4 =120.\n\nOther days: 6 days *15 papers =90 papers. 90 *1=90. Total is 120+90=210. That's correct. So the math checks out. So the answer must be A)15. So the options given have A as 15, so that's the answer. So why is the user giving me this problem? Maybe I'm missing something else.\n\nWait the question is asking for Monday's count. Which is x, which is 15. So answer A. Therefore, I think the correct answer is A)15. But maybe I made a mistake in the interpretation of the problem's wording?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days\". So the total for the other days is T, and Sunday is 2T. But that led to fractions. Maybe the problem actually says \"twice as many on Sunday as on each of the other days\", which would be the first case. So yes, A is correct.\n\nHmm, unless there's a different way to interpret it. Let me try another approach. Suppose that the hotel buys the same number every day except Sunday, and on Sunday buys twice that number. Let x be the number bought each non-Sunday day. So Sunday is 2x. Then total cost is 6x*1 +2x*4 =6x +8x =14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday is x=15. So A. Yeah, so the answer should be A. The options are there, so that's correct. Maybe I was overcomplicating.\n",

Let's say the number of newspapers the hotel buys on a regular day (non-Sunday) is x. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice as many, so that would be 2x. Wait, but wait, the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Wait, does that mean each non-Sunday day they buy x, and Sunday is 2x? Or does it mean that the total for the other days (Monday to Saturday) is x, and Sunday is 2x? Hmm, that part needs to be clarified.\n\nWait, the wording says: \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Wait, \"the rest of the days of the week\" probably refers to each day except Sunday? Or the total for all other days? Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Wait, maybe the way to interpret it is that on each of the other days, they buy x, so the Sunday is twice that. But maybe the problem is that the hotel orders on Sunday twice as many as it does on any other single day. That would make sense. Because if it's twice as many on Sunday as the rest of the days combined, that would be different. But the wording is a bit tricky here.\n\nWait the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Hmm. Let me parse that sentence again. The phrase \"the rest of the days of the week\" probably refers to the total number of papers ordered on the other days. So, for example, if on each of the other days they buy x papers, then the total for the rest of the days (Monday to Saturday) would be 6x. So then Sunday's order would be twice that? Wait, but that might not be the correct interpretation. Alternatively, maybe \"the rest of the days\" is per day. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hotel buys the same number of papers each day except Sunday, and on Sunday they buy twice as many as each of those days. So, let me try that approach first. Let me define variables again.\n\nLet me try to define variables step by step. Let's assume that from Monday to Saturday, the hotel buys x papers each day. Then, Sunday's order would be twice that, so 2x. So the total for the week would be:\n\nSunday: 2x papers at $4 each. So cost is 2x *4 = 8x.\n\nThe other 6 days (Monday to Saturday): each day x papers at $1 each. So total cost for those days is 6x *1 =6x.\n\nTotal weekly cost is 8x +6x =14x. According to the problem, that equals $210. So 14x =210 \u2192 x=15. Therefore, on Monday, they buy x=15 papers, so the answer would be A)15. But wait, let me check the options. The options include 15 as A. But let me see if that's the right approach.\n\nWait, but maybe I misinterpreted the problem's wording. Let me check again. The problem says: \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Hmm, the wording might mean that the number of papers on Sunday is twice the number ordered on the other days. But does that refer to per day or total?\n\nThe key phrase is \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The structure here is \"twice as many on Sunday as [it does on] the rest of the days\". So, the comparison is between the number on Sunday versus the total for the rest of the days. Because \"the rest of the days of the week\" would refer to all the other days combined. So, the Sunday's order is twice the total of all the other days. That's a different interpretation. Let me try this way.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet the number of papers bought on each non-Sunday day be x. So, from Monday to Saturday, that's 6 days, so total for those days is 6x. Then, Sunday's order is twice that total, so Sunday is 2*(6x) =12x?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Wait, the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". So Sunday's quantity is twice the total of the other days. So, if the other days total Y, then Sunday is 2Y. So total papers for the week would be Y + 2Y = 3Y. But let's see the cost.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that each day except Sunday, they buy x papers, and on Sunday they buy 2x. But the problem's wording is ambiguous here, so this is crucial.\n\nHmm, this is a problem because the answer depends on that. Let me see.\n\nFirst approach (assuming that Sunday's order is twice the daily order on other days):\n\nSo, if each non-Sunday day is x, then Sunday is 2x. The total cost is Sunday's cost plus 6 days of the other days.\n\nSunday cost: 2x * $4 =8x.\n\nOther days: 6 days * x * $1 =6x.\n\nTotal cost: 14x =210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday's papers are 15. Option A.\n\nSecond approach (if Sunday is twice the total of all other days):\n\nLet total of other days (Mon-Sat) be Y. Then Sunday is 2Y. \n\nTotal cost would be Sunday's cost (2Y *4) plus the other days (Y *1). Wait, but Y is the total for the other days? Wait, no, Y would be the total for the other days. Wait, perhaps:\n\nLet me define variables again. Let me let the number of papers bought on each non-Sunday day be x per day. So total for the 6 days is 6x. Then Sunday's papers are twice that total, so 2*(6x) =12x. \n\nThen the cost for Sunday would be 12x *4. The cost for the other days is 6x *1. \n\nTotal cost: (12x *4) + (6x*1) = 48x +6x =54x. \n\nSet equal to 210: 54x=210 \u2192 x=210/54 \u22483.888. That's not an integer, which would be odd since the answer options are all integers. So that suggests that maybe this second approach is wrong, since the first approach gives an integer. So that probably means the first interpretation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that the number of papers on Sunday is twice as much as any other day. So, each non-Sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. Then, the first approach is correct, leading to x=15. \n\nSo the answer would be A)15. But let me check again.\n\nWait the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse the grammar. The phrase \"the rest of the days of the week\" is the comparison point. So \"it does [on] the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014 meaning the total number on the other days. So, if the hotel buys on Sunday twice as many as the total of all the other days. That would be the second approach. But that leads to a non-integer answer, which is a problem. So perhaps the problem is intended to be that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hotel orders the same number every day except Sunday, which is twice as much. So, for example, if Monday to Saturday they order x each day, Sunday is 2x. So total for the week would be 6x (Monday-Saturday) plus 2x (Sunday) = 8x papers, but the cost would be different. Wait, but the cost on Sunday is $4 per paper, so that's important.\n\nWait let me recast the first approach with the first interpretation again:\n\nSuppose that on each non-Sunday day (Monday-Saturday), the hotel buys x papers each day. So for 6 days, total is 6x papers. Sunday's order is twice as many as any of the other days. So Sunday is 2x papers. Wait, no\u2014if it's twice as many as each other day, then Sunday is 2x. \n\nSo the cost for Sunday would be 2x * $4 =8x.\n\nThe cost for the other days: 6x papers (total) at $1 each: 6x*1=6x. \n\nTotal cost: 8x +6x =14x =210 \u2192 x=15. \n\nThen, Monday's papers are x=15, so answer A. \n\nThis gives an integer. The second approach (where Sunday is twice the total of all other days) gives a fractional x, which is unlikely. Therefore, the first interpretation is correct. \n\nTherefore the answer is 15, option A. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. The problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The wording \"the rest of the days of the week\" could be interpreted as the total for all other days. So \"as it does the rest of the days\"\u2014 meaning the total for the other days. So Sunday's number is twice that total. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that. Let me try again with that interpretation. Let me let Y be the total number of papers bought on all non-Sunday days (Monday to Saturday). Then Sunday's papers are 2Y. \n\nThe total cost would be:\n\nSunday's cost: 2Y * $4 = 8Y.\n\nNon-Sunday cost: Y * $1 = Y.\n\nTotal cost: 8Y + Y =9Y =210 \u2192 Y=210/9 \u224823.333. Not an integer. Hmm, but that's not a whole number. Which would be a problem since you can't buy a fraction of a newspaper. So that suggests that this interpretation is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem's wording is that the number on Sunday is twice as much as each of the other days. So each non-Sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. \n\nSo that would be the first approach again, which gives an integer answer. So that's probably the correct way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the number on Sunday is twice the average of the other days, but that's complicating. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\"\u2014 meaning per day. Like, each day except Sunday, the hotel buys x, and Sunday is 2x. So that would be the same as first approach. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A)15. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are A)15, B)30, etc. So the answer would be 15. But let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hotel buys the same number of papers every day, but on Sunday twice as many. Let me see. Suppose that from Monday to Saturday, they buy x each day, so 6x total. Sunday is 2x. \n\nWait, that's the same as before. So the total cost is 6x*1 (for Monday to Saturday) plus 2x*4 (Sunday). \n\n6x +8x=14x=210 \u2192x=15. So Monday's papers are x=15. So answer A. \n\nTherefore, I think that's correct. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me check the options again. The problem says \"how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\" which is one of the non-Sunday days. So yes, that would be x=15, so option A.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the hotel buys the same number every non-Sunday day. What if the \"rest of the days\" refers to each day, so the hotel buys x on each non-Sunday day, and Sunday is 2x. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hotel buys the same number every day except Sunday, where it's twice that number. So that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hotel buys a certain number on non-Sundays, but the \"twice as many\" refers to the total for the week. Wait, but the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\". \n\nHmm, maybe the problem is phrased such that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. For example, if each other day is 15, then Sunday is 30. Then the total cost would be:\n\nSunday: 30 *4 =120.\n\nOther days: 6 days *15 *1 =90. Total 210. Which works. So that gives the Monday count as 15, so A. \n\nAlternatively, if the hotel buys the same number every day except Sunday, which is twice that. \n\nYes, so that's exactly the first approach. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A)15. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The first option is 15, so that would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try plugging the answer options into the problem to see.\n\nSuppose the answer is A)15. Then Monday is 15. So each non-Sunday day is 15. Sunday is 30. \n\nTotal cost:\n\nSunday: 30 *4 =120.\n\nOther days: 6 days *15 *1 =90. 120+90=210. Perfect. So that works. \n\nIf I try option B)30, that would mean Monday is 30. So each non-Sunday day is 30. Sunday is 60. Then:\n\nSunday cost:60 *4=240. Other days:6*30*1=180. Total 240+180=420. Which is way over. So that's not right. \n\nSo A is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n",

Since the hotel buys twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on any other day, the number of newspapers bought on Sunday is \\( 2x \\). \n\n**Cost Calculation:**\n- **Sunday's Cost:** \\( 2x \\) newspapers at $4 each: \\( 2x \\times 4 = 8x \\).\n- **Other Days' Cost:** \\( 6x \\) newspapers (6 days at \\( x \\) each) at $1 each: \\( 6x \\times 1 = 6x \\).\n\nTotal weekly cost is the sum of these:\n\\[\n8x + 6x = 14x\n\\]\nGiven the total weekly cost is $210:\n\\[\n14x = 210 \\implies x = \\frac{210}{14} = 15\n\\]\nThus, the number of newspapers bought on Monday (a non-Sunday day) is \\( x = 15 \\).\n\n**Verification:**\n- Sunday: \\( 2 \\times 15 = 30 \\) newspapers at $4: \\( 30 \\times 4 = 120 \\).\n- Other days: \\( 6 \\times 15 = 90 \\) newspapers at $1: \\( 90 \\times 1 = 90 \\).\n- Total: \\( 120 + 90 = 210 \\), which matches the given total.\n\nAnswer: A)15.\n\nAnswer: A",
