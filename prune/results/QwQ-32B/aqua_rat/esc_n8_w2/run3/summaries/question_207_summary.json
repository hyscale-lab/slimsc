      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again. The question says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find the number. The options are A through E. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nAlright, first step is to translate the words into an algebraic equation. Let me denote the unknown number as, say, x. That's the standard approach. So, the problem states that when you take two-thirds of this number and subtract 10, it equals the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. Let me write that out step by step.\n\nSo, two-thirds of the number would be (2/3)x. Subtracting 10 from that gives me (2/3)x - 10. The problem says this is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. The sum part would be 40 + (1/3)x. So putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let me rearrange this equation. Maybe first get all the terms with x on one side and constants on the other. Let's subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get rid of it on the right. That would give:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40\n\nSimplifying the x terms: (2/3 - 1/3)x is (1/3)x. So now the equation becomes:\n\n(1/3)x - 10 = 40\n\nNext, I can add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with x:\n\n(1/3)x = 40 + 10\n(1/3)x = 50\n\nNow, to solve for x, multiply both sides by 3:\n\nx = 50 * 3\nx = 150\n\nWait a second, but let me check the options. Option C is 150. Hmm, but let me verify my steps again to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over, the equation was (2/3)x -10 = 40 + (1/3)x. Subtract (1/3)x from both sides: (2/3 -1/3)x is (1/3)x, so yes, that part's correct. Then subtract the 10? Wait, the equation after that step is (1/3)x -10 =40. Then adding 10 gives (1/3)x =50, so x is 150. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me plug it back into the original equation to check. Let's test x=150.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*150 -10. 2/3 of 150 is 100, so 100-10=90.\n\nRight side: 40 + (1/3)*150. 1/3 of 150 is 50, so 40+50=90. \n\nYes, both sides equal 90. So that works. So the answer should be C)150. Let me check the options again. The options are A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220. So C is correct. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made an error in the algebra steps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try another approach. Let me try plugging in the other options just to be thorough. Let's see option B is 160. Let's test that.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*160 -10. 2/3 of 160 is (320/3) \u2248 106.666..., subtract 10 gives \u224896.666...\n\nRight side: 40 + (1/3)*160 =40 + 53.333... = 93.333... Not equal. So B is out.\n\nOption D, 210. Left: (2/3)*210 =140 minus10 is 130. Right:40 +70=110. Not equal.\n\nOption E: 220. Left: (2/3)*220 is about 146.666-10=136.666. Right:40 + (220/3)= ~40+73.333=113.333. Not equal.\n\nOption A:100. Left: (200/3 -10)= approx 66.666-10=56.666. Right:40 + (100/3) \u224840+33.333=73.333. Not equal.\n\nSo yes, only C gives equal on both sides. Therefore, the correct answer must be C)150. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. The steps make sense, and verifying with substitution confirms it. So I'm confident the answer is C.\n",

Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Let me denote the unknown number as, say, x. That's the standard approach. So, the problem translates into an equation. Let me try to write that out.\n\nThe first part: \"If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number\" \u2014 so that would be (2/3)x minus 10. Wait, no, the order matters here. The wording says \"10 is subtracted from 2/3 of the number\". So, subtract 10 from (2/3)x. So that's (2/3)x - 10.\n\nThe result of that is equal to \"the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number\". The sum would be 40 plus (1/3)x. So putting it all together:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nOkay, so now I need to solve for x. Let me rearrange this equation.

So:\n\n(1/3)x -10 =40\n\nThen, add 10 to both sides to get rid of the -10 on the left:\n\n(1/3)x = 50\n\nHmm, so then multiplying both sides by 3 gives x = 150. Wait, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake in the steps.\n\nWait, let's re-derive that.

Subtract 10 gives 130. The other side: 40 +70 (since 210/3=70) is 110. Not equal. So no.\n\nOption E, 220: 2/3*220 is about 146.666, minus 10 is 136.666. The other side would be 40 + (220/3)= ~40+73.333=113.333. Not equal.\n\nOption A, 100: 2/3*100\u224866.666, minus 10 is 56.666. The other side:40 + 33.333=73.333. Not equal.
