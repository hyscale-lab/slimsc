      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about the rate at which a liquid passes through a drain. The rate given is w/25 gallons every x seconds. And we need to find out how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through. Alright, so first, I need to figure out the rate in gallons per second or something, then convert that into minutes, right?\n\nLet me start by understanding the given rate. The problem states that the drain passes w/25 gallons every x seconds. So the rate (R) would be (w/25) gallons divided by x seconds. So R = (w/25)/x gallons per second. Alternatively, I can write that as R = w/(25x) gallons per second. \n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes to drain y gallons. Since rate is volume over time, time would be volume divided by rate. So time (T) in seconds would be y divided by R. Let me write that out: T = y / (w/(25x)). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so that becomes y * (25x)/w. So that's (25xy)/w seconds. \n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes, not seconds. Oh right, so I need to convert seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so to convert seconds to minutes, divide by 60. So the time in minutes would be (25xy)/w divided by 60. Let me compute that: (25xy)/(w * 60). \n\nHmm, simplifying that fraction. Let's see, 25 and 60 can both be divided by 5. 25 divided by 5 is 5, and 60 divided by 5 is 12. So that simplifies to (5xy)/(12w). Wait, so that would be option C? Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA) y/(1200xy) \u2013 Doesn't look right. The units might not match.\n\nB) 20xy/w \u2013 Hmm, that's way bigger than what I got. Probably not.\n\nC)5xy/(12w) \u2013 That matches my calculation.\n\nD) w/(3xy) \u2013 The variables are flipped, so probably not.\n\nE)3y/(wx) \u2013 Not matching either.\n\nSo I think the answer is C. But let me double-check my steps to be sure.\n\nStarting over: Rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So per second, it's (w/25)/x = w/(25x). To get y gallons, time in seconds is y divided by that rate. So y/(w/(25x)) = 25xy/w seconds. Convert to minutes by dividing by 60: (25xy)/(60w). Simplify numerator and denominator by 5 gives 5xy/(12w). Yep, that's correct. So option C is the right answer. The other options don't fit the math here. I think that's solid.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about the rate at which a liquid passes through a drain, and I need to find out how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through. Hmm, the question gives me the rate as w/25 gallons every x seconds. I need to convert that into the time required for y gallons, and the answer should be in minutes. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's recall that rate is usually quantity over time. The given rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So maybe I should find the rate in gallons per second first. Wait, right. The rate is (w/25) gallons divided by x seconds. So the rate in gallons per second would be (w/(25x)) gallons per second. Because (w/25) divided by x is w/(25x). \n\nBut the question asks for how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass. So time is equal to amount divided by rate. So time in seconds would be y divided by the rate (w/(25x)). Let me write that out:\n\nTime (seconds) = y / (w/(25x)) = y * (25x/w) = (25xy)/w seconds. \n\nBut the answer needs to be in minutes, so I have to convert seconds to minutes. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, divide the time in seconds by 60. So that would be (25xy/w) / 60 = (25xy)/(60w) minutes. \n\nHmm, let me simplify that fraction. 25 and 60 can both be divided by 5. 25 divided by 5 is 5, and 60 divided by 5 is 12. So that simplifies to (5xy)/(12w). Wait, so that would be option C? Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA) y/(1200xy) \u2192 Doesn't make sense because the variables are in the denominator. Probably not.\n\nB) 20xy/w \u2192 That's way bigger. Let me see, my calculation had 25/(60) which reduces to 5/12. 25/60 is 5/12, so 5 divided by 12 is approximately 0.416..., so 5/12 times (xy/w). So B is 20xy over w. Hmm, 20 is way bigger than 5/12. So that can't be right. \n\nC) 5xy/(12w) \u2192 That's exactly what I got. So that's a candidate.\n\nD) w/(3xy) \u2192 That's inverted, probably.\n\nE) 3y/(wx) \u2192 Also different. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my steps. Let me go through again. \n\nThe rate is given as (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So per second, that's (w/25)/x = w/(25x) gallons per second. \n\nTime needed to drain y gallons is total volume divided by rate: y / (w/(25x)) = y * 25x/w = (25xy)/w seconds. \n\nConvert seconds to minutes: divide by 60. So (25xy)/(w*60). \n\n25 divided by 60 is 5/12, so that's (5xy)/(12w). So that's option C. \n\nHmm, but let me check if maybe I misread the original rate. The problem says \"passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds\". So that's (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So yeah, the rate is (w/25)/x gallons per second. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of units. Let's see:\n\nThe rate is (w/25 gal) / (x sec) \u2192 units of gal/sec. To find time (in minutes) for y gallons, set up as:\n\nTime (seconds) = (y gal) / ( (w/(25x)) gal/sec ) \u2192 which gives seconds. Then divide by 60 to get minutes. So same as before. \n\nSo the answer should be C. Let me check the options again. Option C is 5xy/(12w). Yep, that's exactly what I have. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic? Let's see:\n\n25 divided by 60: 25/60 = 5/12. So 25/(60) = 5/12. So yes, 25xy/w divided by 60 is (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w). \n\nHmm, so that's correct. So the answer must be C. \n\nLooking at the options again, the other options don't fit. Like option E is 3y/(wx). That would be if perhaps the time was in some other conversion. Wait, maybe I messed up the initial rate?\n\nWait, another approach. Let's think in terms of proportions. \n\nIf (w/25) gallons take x seconds, then 1 gallon takes (x * 25)/w seconds. Therefore, y gallons take (25x y)/w seconds. Convert seconds to minutes by dividing by 60, so (25xy)/(60w) = 5xy/(12w). Yep, same result. \n\nSo I think I'm confident that the answer is option C. Let me just check if any of the other options could be equivalent. \n\nOption B is 20xy/w. That would be if instead of dividing by 60, you multiplied by 60, which would be wrong. Like 25x/y * 60? Not sure. \n\nHmm, okay. I think C is correct.\n",
