      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here about averages and percentages. Hmm. The question says that passing students averaged 83, failing ones 55, and the overall average is 76. I need to find what percent passed. Alright, so how do I approach this?\n\nI remember that average problems like this can often be solved using weighted averages. Like, the overall average is a weighted mean between the two groups. So maybe I can set up an equation where the pass percentage times 83 plus the fail percentage times 55 equals 76. But percentages add up to 100%, right?\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the percentage of students who passed as P, and those who failed as F. Since it's percentages of the same class, P + F = 100%. So F would be 100% - P. \n\nThe total average would be (P * 83 + F *55)/100 =76. Since F is 100-P, substituting that in:\n\n(P *83 + (100-P)*55)/100 =76.\n\nMultiply both sides by 100 to get rid of the denominator:\n\n83P + 55(100 - P) = 7600.\n\nExpanding that: 83P + 5500 -55P =7600.\n\nCombine like terms: (83P -55P) +5500 =7600 \u2192 28P +5500 =7600.\n\nSubtract 5500 from both sides: 28P = 2100.\n\nThen P = 2100 /28. Let me compute that. 28 times 75 is 2100, right? Wait, 28*70 is 1960, plus 28*5 is 140. 1960+140=2100. Oh yeah, so 2100 divided by 28 is 75. Wait, so P is 75%? But looking at the options, E is 75%, but the options given are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%. So then E would be the answer?\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Let me redo the calculation step by step.\n\nSo equation: 83P +55(100-P) = 7600.\n\nExpanding: 83P +5500 -55P = 7600.\n\nSo 83P minus 55P is 28P. So 28P +5500 =7600.\n\nSubtract 5500: 28P = 2100. 2100 divided by 28. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 7: 2100/7 is 300, 28/7 is 4. So 300/4 =75. Yep, that's 75. So P is 75%, so answer E?\n\nBut wait, the options have E as 75%, which would be the answer. But let me think again. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me confirm the numbers again. The passing average is 83, failing 55, overall 76. The calculation seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a ratio. The difference between 83 and 55 is 28. The overall average is 76, which is 76-55 =21 above the failing average, and 83-76=7 below the passing average. So the ratio of failing to passing students would be 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. Because the distances are inversely proportional to the ratio of the groups. \n\nWait, that's another way to think about weighted averages. The idea is that the ratio of the groups is inversely proportional to the distances. So the distance from the failing average to the overall is 76-55=21. The distance from the passing to the overall is 83-76=7. So the ratio of pass to fail is 21:7, which is 3:1. So pass is 3 parts, fail 1 part. Total parts 4. So pass is 3/4, which is 75%. Yep, same result. So that confirms it. \n\nTherefore the answer should be E)75%. But wait, the options given include E as 75%, so that's correct. Hmm, but why are there other options? Let me check again. Did I miscalculate something?\n\nWait, in the first method, I assumed that P is the percentage, so when I set up the equation, it's (P/100 *83) + (F/100 *55) =76. But when multiplying by 100, that's correct. So the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should use variables for the number of students. Let's say total students are N. Let P be the number who passed, F failed. Then total score is 83P +55F =76(P + F). Then 83P +55F =76P +76F \u2192 83P -76P =76F -55F \u21927P =21F \u2192 P/F =21/7 \u21923/1. So P is three times F. So total students is P + F =4F. So percentage passed is 3F/(4F)*100 =75%. Yep, same answer. So definitely E. So the correct answer is E.\n",

Hmm, the question is about finding the percentage of students who passed the class based on their averages. The passing students averaged 83, the failing ones 55, and the overall average is 76. I need to figure out what percent passed. \n\nAlright, so I remember that when dealing with averages like this, maybe I can use some kind of weighted average formula. The overall average is a mix of the two groups' averages. Let me think. Let's say the number of passing students is P and failing is F. The total number of students would be P + F. \n\nThe total points for passing students would be 83P and for failing students 55F. The overall average is (83P +55F)/(P + F) =76. That's the equation I need to work with. \n\nHmm, maybe I can rearrange this equation to find the ratio of P to F. Let's do that. Multiply both sides by (P + F) to get rid of the denominator: 83P +55F =76(P + F). \n\nExpanding the right side gives 76P +76F. Now subtract 76P and 76F from both sides to get all terms on one side. Let's see: 83P -76P = 76F -55F. \n\nThat simplifies to 7P =21F. Wait, 83-76 is 7, and 76-55 is 21. So 7P =21F. Dividing both sides by 7 gives P =3F. \n\nOh, so the number of passing students is three times the number of failing ones. So the ratio of P to F is 3:1. \n\nNow, the total number of students is P + F = 3F + F =4F. Therefore, the percentage of passing students would be (P / Total) *100. Since P is 3F and total is 4F, that's (3F)/(4F) = 3/4, which is 0.75. So 75%? Wait, but 75% is option E. But wait, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't mess up.\n\nWait, let's go through the equations again. Starting from 83P +55F =76(P +F). Then subtract 76P and 76F from both sides:\n\n83P -76P = 7P, and 55F -76F is -21F. Wait, wait a second, maybe I made a mistake here in the signs. Let me re-arrange the equation properly.\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying out: 83P +55F =76P +76F. \n\nSubtract 76P from both sides: 7P +55F =76F. \n\nThen subtract 55F: 7P = 21F. Oh, right, that's the same as before. So 7P =21F \u2192 P =3F. So that part is correct. \n\nSo the ratio of passing to failing is 3:1. Therefore, out of every 4 students, 3 passed, so 75%? But wait, the options include 75% as E, but the options given here have E as 75. Hmm. Wait, but let me think again. \n\nWait, the question asks for the percentage of the class that passed. So if passing students are 3 parts and failing 1 part, total parts 4. So 3/4 is 75%. So the answer would be E)75%. But wait, the options given here are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%. So E is the answer. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made an error in the calculation steps. Let me check again. Let me try plugging in numbers. Suppose there are 4 students: 3 passed, 1 failed. \n\nTotal points: 3*83 +1*55 = 249 +55 = 304. Average is 304 /4 =76, which matches the given overall average. So that works. So 3/4 is indeed 75%, so E is correct. \n\nBut wait, the options given in the problem include E as 75%, so that's the answer. Hmm, but why does the option B say 66%? That's like 2/3, which would be if the ratio was 2:1. Maybe I need to double-check my math again. \n\nWait, let me see. Let me think of another way. Let\u2019s let the percentage of passing students be x, so the failing is (100 -x)%. Then the average would be 83x +55(100 -x) =76*100. \n\nWait, that's another approach. Let me try that. \n\nSo, if x is the percentage (as a decimal?), maybe better to use fractions. Let me set variables properly. Let\u2019s say the total number of students is 100 for simplicity. Let p be the number of passing students, so 100 - p are failing. \n\nThen the total points would be 83p +55(100 -p) =76*100. \n\nLet me compute this equation:\n\n83p +5500 -55p =7600\n\nCombine terms: (83-55)p = 7600-5500 \u2192 28p = 2100 \u2192 p =2100/28.

So the correct answer is E, 75%. \n\nWait, but the options given include E as 75, so that's the answer. So why would someone think it's another option? Maybe I made a mistake in my first calculation.
