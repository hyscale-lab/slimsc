      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about a rectangular parking space where three sides are painted, and one side isn't. The unpainted side is 9 feet long. The sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. I need to find the area of the parking space. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. A rectangle has four sides. Since three sides are painted, that means one side isn't. The unpainted side is given as 9 feet. But wait, which side is that? The problem doesn't specify whether the unpainted side is a length or a width. Like, maybe it's one of the lengths or one of the widths. Hmm, so maybe I need to consider both possibilities?\n\nWait, but in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So if the unpainted side is, say, the length, then the other length is painted. But then the two widths would be painted as well. Wait, maybe I should think of the rectangle as having two lengths and two widths. Since three sides are painted, the unpainted side could be either a length or a width. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to assign variables. Let me try that.\n\nLet's assume that the parking space is a rectangle with length L and width W. Let's suppose that the unpainted side is one of the lengths. Then, the three painted sides would be the other length (L) and the two widths (W each). Wait, no. Wait, if the unpainted side is a length, then the other three sides would be the other length and the two widths. But the problem says three sides are painted. Alternatively, maybe the unpainted side is a width. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sides are arranged in such a way that the three painted sides could be two lengths and one width, or two widths and one length. But the problem says the unpainted side is 9 feet. So the unpainted side could be either a length or a width. Hmm, so I might need to consider both cases, but maybe there's a way to set up equations.\n\nLet me try setting variables. Let me suppose that the unpainted side is a length, so that length is 9 feet. Then the other three sides (another length and two widths) would have a total length of 37 feet. So, the other length is also 9 (since opposite sides are equal), so the sum would be 9 (the other length) plus 2*widths = 37. Wait, but then 9 + 2W = 37. Then 2W = 28, so W would be 14. Then the area would be L*W = 9*14 = 126. Hmm, option C is 126. But wait, maybe the unpainted side is a width instead. Let me check that case.\n\nAlternatively, suppose the unpainted side is a width, so W = 9. Then the painted sides would be the two lengths and one width. Wait, no. Wait, three sides painted. If the unpainted is a width, then the three painted sides would be the two lengths and the other width. Wait, but there are two widths. So the unpainted side is one width, so the painted sides would be the two lengths and the other width. The sum would be L + L + W (since the other width is painted) equals 37. Wait, so that's 2L + W = 37. But since the unpainted side is W =9, so substituting, 2L +9 =37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Then area would be L * W =14*9=126 again. Oh, same answer. Wait, so either way, the area comes out the same?\n\nWait, that's interesting. Because whether the unpainted side is a length or a width, the area ends up being the same. Because if the unpainted is length (9), then W becomes 14, so area is 9*14. If unpainted is width (9), then L is 14, so area is 14*9. Either way, 126. So the answer would be C)126. Hmm. So why is the option E there? Maybe I made a mistake?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nSuppose the parking space is a rectangle. Three sides are painted. The unpainted side is 9 feet. The sum of the painted sides is 37. Need to find the area.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the cases. Let me try again.\n\nCase 1: The unpainted side is a length (so L=9). The three painted sides would be the other length (9) and the two widths (W each). So total painted length is 9 + 2W =37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Area is L*W=9*14=126.\n\nCase 2: The unpainted side is a width (so W=9). The three painted sides would be the two lengths (L each) and the other width (9). So total painted length is 2L +9 =37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area is 14*9=126.\n\nEither way, same area. So the answer should be C)126. So that's one of the options. So why is E an option? Maybe I made an error in the setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's wording. Let me read again.\n\n\"A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?\"\n\nWait, the problem says \"the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet\". Wait, \"length\" here refers to the measurement, not necessarily the side being a length. Oh, wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Because in a rectangle, sides can be length or width, but the problem says \"the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet\". So regardless of whether it's a length or width, the unpainted side's length is 9. So in either case, the calculation works out as before. So the answer must be C.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 126, so that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be C. So I think the correct option is C.\n",

The parking space has four sides: two lengths and two widths. The problem mentions the unpainted side is 9 feet. Wait, but which side is that? The problem says three sides are painted.

Let's denote variables. Let me call the length of the rectangle as L and the width as W. The problem states that the unpainted side is 9 feet. So that could be either L or W. Let's see.\n\nCase 1: Suppose the unpainted side is the length (L = 9). Then the painted sides would be the other length (L) and the two widths (W each). The sum of the painted sides would be L + 2W. According to the problem, this sum is 37. So substituting L as 9, that would give 9 + 2W = 37. Then 2W = 28 \u2192 W = 14. Then the area would be L \u00d7 W = 9 \u00d714 = 126.

Wait, if the unpainted is one of the widths, then the three painted sides would be the two lengths and the other width. So sum of painted sides is 2L + W (since the other width is painted). Wait, no, the unpainted is W, so the three painted sides are two lengths and the other width. So that would be 2L + W. So the equation would be 2L + W =37. Since the unpainted W is 9, so W=9.

Then the three painted sides would be the other length and the two widths. That's three sides. Alternatively, if the unpainted is a width, then the three painted are two lengths and the other width. That also works. Either way, three sides. So the problem doesn't specify which side is unpainted, but in both scenarios, the area is the same. Therefore, the answer must be C)126. \n\nHmm, but let me see if there's another way this could be approached. Suppose I didn't consider both cases, maybe I made a mistake.

Let the length and width be \\( L \\) and \\( W \\). The sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. \n\n**Case 1:** The unpainted side is \\( L = 9 \\). The painted sides are \\( L \\) and the two widths \\( W \\).  \nEquation: \\( L + 2W = 37 \\).  \nSubstituting \\( L = 9 \\):  \n\\( 9 + 2W = 37 \\Rightarrow 2W = 28 \\Rightarrow W = 14 \\).  \nArea: \\( L \\times W = 9 \\times 14 = 126 \\).\n\n**Case 2:** The unpainted side is \\( W = 9 \\). The painted sides are the two lengths \\( L \\) and the other width \\( W \\).  \nEquation: \\( 2L + W = 37 \\).  \nSubstituting \\( W = 9 \\):  \n\\( 2L + 9 = 37 \\Rightarrow 2L = 28 \\Rightarrow L = 14 \\).  \nArea: \\( L \\times W = 14 \\times 9 = 126 \\).\n\nIn both scenarios, the area is \\( 126 \\) square feet, which matches option C. \n\nAnswer: C",
