      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about M men who want to buy a gift that costs D rupees. If 3 men drop out, how much more does each have to contribute? Hmm. I need to figure out the additional amount each person has to pay when there are fewer people sharing the cost.\n\nAlright, so first, originally each man was supposed to pay D divided by M, right? Because the total cost is D, and there are M men. So the original contribution per person is D/M.\n\nNow, if 3 men drop out, then the number of men left is M minus 3. So the new number of contributors is (M - 3). Therefore, each remaining man now has to pay D divided by (M - 3). \n\nThe question is asking how much more each has to contribute. So I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the original contribution. \n\nLet me write that down. The new contribution is D/(M - 3), and the original was D/M. The difference would be [D/(M - 3) - D/M]. That should give the extra amount each person has to pay.\n\nLet me compute this difference. To subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (M - 3) and M, so the common denominator would be M*(M - 3). \n\nSo, the first term becomes D*M / [M*(M-3)] and the second term is D*(M - 3)/[M*(M-3)]. Subtracting them gives [DM - D(M -3)] / [M(M-3)].\n\nExpanding the numerator: DM - DM + 3D. The DM terms cancel, leaving 3D. So the numerator is 3D, and the denominator is M*(M -3). So the difference is 3D / [M(M -3)].\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M). Wait, M squared minus 3M is the same as M(M-3), right? Because M(M-3) = M\u00b2 -3M. So that's exactly the denominator here. So the answer should be option D.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me see again the steps:\n\nOriginal contribution per person: D/M.\n\nAfter 3 drop out, new per person: D/(M-3).\n\nDifference is D/(M-3) - D/M = D [1/(M-3) - 1/M] = D [ (M - (M-3)) / (M(M-3)) ) ]\n\nCalculating numerator inside the brackets: M - (M-3) = 3. So that gives D*(3)/(M(M-3)), which is 3D/(M(M-3)). Which is the same as 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M). So yes, that's exactly option D.\n\nHmm, so the correct answer is D. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) D/(M-3) \u2192 No, that's just the new amount, not the difference.\n\nB) MD/3 \u2192 Doesn't look right.\n\nC) M/(D-3) \u2192 Doesn't make sense, units are off.\n\nD) 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M) \u2192 Yes, that's what I got.\n\nE) None of these \u2192 Not needed here.\n\nSo the answer is D. Therefore, the correct choice is D.\n",

Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, first, the original scenario. The total cost is fixed at D. Originally, there are M men sharing the cost equally. So each person's share would be D divided by M, right? So original contribution per person is D/M.\n\nNow, if 3 men drop out, the number of men left is M minus 3. So the new number of contributors is (M - 3). Therefore, each remaining person now has to pay D divided by (M - 3). That's the new contribution per person: D/(M - 3).\n\nThe question is asking how much more each has to contribute. So I need to find the difference between the new contribution and the original contribution. Let me write that down:\n\nIncrease in contribution = New share - Original share\n= [D/(M - 3)] - [D/M]\n\nHmm, to compute this difference, I need to subtract these two fractions. Let me find a common denominator. The denominators are (M - 3) and M, so the common denominator would be M*(M - 3). \n\nSo, rewriting both terms:\n= [D*M / (M*(M - 3))] - [D*(M - 3)/(M*(M - 3))]\n= [DM - D(M - 3)] / [M(M - 3)]\n\nWait, let me check that numerator again. Wait, no, actually, when expanding the second term, it's D*(M - 3) over the denominator. Wait, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me re-calculate the numerator step by step.\n\nThe first term's numerator is D multiplied by M (since the denominator becomes M*(M-3), so we multiply numerator and denominator by M). The second term's numerator is D*(M-3) because we multiplied its denominator by (M - 3) to get the common denominator. Wait, no, actually, the first term is D/(M-3) becomes D*M over [M(M-3)], and the second term D/M becomes D*(M-3) over [M(M-3)]. So when subtracting, the numerator is D*M - D*(M - 3). \n\nSo numerator: D*M - D(M - 3) = D [ M - (M - 3) ] = D [ M - M +3 ] = D *3. \n\nTherefore, the difference is (3D) divided by [M(M -3)]. \n\nSo the increase per person is 3D/(M(M -3)). \n\nLooking at the options, let's check. Option D says 3D/(M squared minus 3M). Wait, M squared minus 3M is M(M -3), which matches the denominator here.

Wait, that's probably a typo for M squared. Because M2 would be M times 2? No, no, maybe it's M squared. Like M\u00b2 -3M. So M squared minus 3M is indeed M(M -3), so yes. So the answer would be D?\n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps again because sometimes I might have messed up.\n\nOriginal share: D/M. New share after 3 drop out: D/(M-3). The difference is D/(M-3) - D/M. Let me compute that again:\n\nDifference = D/(M-3) - D/M = D [ 1/(M-3) - 1/M ] \n\nCombine the fractions: \n\n= D [ (M - (M-3)) / (M(M-3)) ]\n\nThe numerator inside the brackets is M - (M -3) = 3. \n\nSo overall, 3D/(M(M-3)), which is exactly 3D divided by (M^2 -3M). So that's exactly option D. \n\nHmm, so the correct answer should be D. But wait, let me check the options again. The options list D as \"3D/(M2-3M)\", which I assume is 3D over M squared minus 3M. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is D. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think if there's any chance that the question is a trick question. Like, maybe they didn't account for the difference correctly? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when they say \"how much more will each have to contribute\", perhaps the question expects the new amount, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. \n\nOption A is D/(M-3), which is the new share, not the increase. So that's not the answer. The question asks for the increase, so that's why we subtract.
