      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about averages and adding a new vehicle to the group. Hmm, the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then when they add a new truck, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck.\n\nFirst, I remember that average is total divided by the number of items. So the original total weight of the 10 vehicles would be 10 times 12.2. Let me calculate that. 10 times 12 is 120, plus 10 times 0.2 is 2, so total is 122 tons. Right.\n\nNow, when the new truck is added, there are now 11 vehicles. The new average is the old average plus 2.6. So the new average is 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add those: 12.2 plus 2.6 is 14.8 tons. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, maybe I should check that again. Wait the average increased by 2.6, so yes, the new average is original average (12.2) plus 2.6. So that's 14.8. \n\nSo the new total weight must be the new average multiplied by the number of vehicles, which is 11. So 14.8 times 11. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 14.8 times 10 is 148, plus 14.8 more, so 148 +14.8 = 162.8 tons total. \n\nThe original total was 122 tons, so the truck's weight must be the difference between the new total and the original total. So 162.8 minus 122 equals... Let me subtract. 162.8 minus 120 is 42.8, then minus 2 more gives 40.8? Wait, wait. Wait, 162.8 - 122. Let me do it step by step. 162.8 minus 122: 122 from 162.8. 162.8 minus 120 is 42.8, then subtract the remaining 2, so 42.8 -2 =40.8. So the truck is 40.8 tons? But looking at the options, option A is 40.8. Hmm. But let me double-check my steps to be sure.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the new average. Let me confirm. The problem says the average increased by 2.6 tons after adding the truck. So original average was 12.2. The new average is 12.2 +2.6 =14.8. That's correct. The new total would be 14.8 *11 = 162.8. Original total was 10*12.2=122. The difference is indeed 40.8, so the truck's weight is 40.8. So the answer should be A?\n\nWait, but let me see the options again. The options are A)40.8, B)41.6, C)42.2, D)43.5, E)44.8. So A is there. Hmm. But wait, maybe I did something wrong here. Let me think of another approach. Alternatively, maybe the formula for the average when adding a new element. The formula for the new average is (sum + x)/(n+1) where x is the new value. \n\nOriginal sum S = 10 *12.2 =122. New average is 12.2 +2.6 =14.8. So (122 + x)/11 =14.8. Multiply both sides by 11: 122 +x =162.8. So x=162.8-122 =40.8. So that's correct. So the answer should be A. But wait, why is there other options? Let me check if I misread the question. The question says the average increased by 2.6 tons. So that's an increase of 2.6, not multiplied by 2.6. So yes, 12.2 plus 2.6 is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying the average became 2.6 times higher? But that would be different. But the wording says \"increased by 2.6 tons\", which means adding 2.6. So I think my calculation is correct. Therefore the answer is A)40.8. But let me check again the arithmetic. \n\n14.8 *11: 14*11 is 154, 0.8*11 is 8.8, so total is 154+8.8=162.8. Then subtract 122. 162.8 -122: 162-122=40, plus 0.8, so 40.8. Yep. So A must be the correct answer.\n",

Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nThe question says that the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then, when a new heavy-duty truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck. Hmm, averages can sometimes be tricky, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the original average is 12.2 tons for 10 vehicles. To find the total weight of those 10 vehicles, I should multiply the average by the number of vehicles. So that would be 10 times 12.2. Let me calculate that: 10 * 12.2 equals 122 tons total. Got that part.\n\nNow, when the new truck is added, the number of vehicles becomes 11. The average weight increases by 2.6 tons. The original average was 12.2, so the new average must be 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add those: 12.2 plus 2.6 is 14.8 tons. Wait, is that right? Let me check again. 12.2 plus 2 is 14.2, plus 0.6 makes 14.8. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo the new average is 14.8 tons for 11 vehicles. To find the new total weight, I multiply 14.8 by 11. Let me do that. Hmm, 14.8 * 10 is 148, so adding another 14.8 gives 162.8 tons total. \n\nNow, the original total was 122 tons, so the truck must have added the difference between the new total and the original total. The difference is 162.8 minus 122. Let me subtract that: 162.8 - 122 equals 40.8 tons. Wait a second, that's one of the options, option A. But wait, that seems low? Let me double-check my steps.\n\nOriginal total: 10 * 12.2 = 122. Correct. New average: 12.2 +2.6 =14.8. New total with 11 vehicles: 14.8 *11. Let me calculate that again. 14.8 * 10 is 148, plus 14.8 is 162.8. So the truck's weight is 162.8 -122 =40.8. So that's 40.8, which is option A. But the options given include A)40.8. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the average calculation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again. The average increased by 2.6 tons after adding the truck. So the new average is original average plus 2.6. That seems right. So 12.2 +2.6 is indeed 14.8. So the calculation seems correct.\n\nWait, but the answer options include higher numbers like 44.8. Maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication? Let me check the new total again. 14.8 multiplied by 11. Let's do it another way. 14 times 11 is 154, and 0.8 times 11 is 8.8, so total is 154 +8.8 =162.8. Yeah, that's correct. So 162.8 minus 122 is 40.8. So the answer must be A?\n\nBut wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says \"the average of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group increased by 2.6 tons after adding the new truck.\" So the increase is 2.6, so the new average is 12.2 +2.6=14.8. That's correct.\n\nHmm, but the options have A as 40.8, which matches my calculation. But why are there other options? Let me see if another approach gives a different result. Alternatively, perhaps the question is saying that the average increased by 2.6 tons, so the total increase per vehicle?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the average increased by 2.6, so the truck's weight contributes not only the difference but also the increase spread over all 11 vehicles?\n\nWait, let me think again. The original total is 122. After adding the truck (let's call its weight x), the new total is 122 + x. The new average is (122 + x)/11, and this is equal to the original average (12.2) plus 2.6. So:\n\n(122 + x)/11 = 12.2 + 2.6  \n(122 + x)/11 =14.8  \nMultiply both sides by 11:  \n122 +x = 14.8*11 =162.8  \nThus x =162.8-122=40.8. So that's exactly what I did before. So the answer should be A. \n\nBut why do the other options exist? Let me check if maybe the problem said that the average increased to 2.6, not by. But the wording says \"increased by 2.6 tons\". So the increase is 2.6. So the answer should be A. \n\nHmm. The options given include A as 40.8, so that must be correct. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Subtract original total, the truck is 40.8. Yes. So the answer is A.\n\nBut why is there an option B as 41.6? Maybe I miscalculated the 14.8*11?\n\nLet me compute 14.8 multiplied by 11 again. 14.8*10 is 148, plus 14.8 gives 162.8. That's correct. 162.8 minus 122 is 40.8. So I think the correct answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant that the average increased to 2.6 tons? Which would be a different problem, but that would be a very low average. But the wording says \"increased by 2.6 tons\", so addition makes sense. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is a trick question, but I can't see how. The steps all check out.
