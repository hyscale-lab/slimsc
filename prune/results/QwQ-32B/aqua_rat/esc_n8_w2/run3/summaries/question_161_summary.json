      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem about Neha and Radha's positions in a row of children. Hmm. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the original positions: Neha is 12th from the left end. So if I imagine the row, her position is number 12 from the left. Radha is 6th from the right end. So from the right side, she's the 6th. \n\nThen, they shift positions. Radha moves 2 places to the left, and Neha moves 2 places to the right. After that, there are 6 children between them. The question is asking for the total number of children in the row. \n\nLet me think of variables. Let the total number of children be N. \n\nIn the original setup, Neha is at position 12 from the left. That means her position from the right would be N - 12 + 1, right? Because the position from the right is total minus left position plus one. Similarly, Radha is 6th from the right, so her original left position is N - 6 + 1 = N -5. \n\nWait, let me make sure. For example, if there are 10 children, someone 1st from the left is 10th from the right. So the formula is correct. So original positions:\n\nNeha's original left position: 12 \u2192 right position is N -12 +1 = N -11.\n\nRadha's original right position:6 \u2192 left position is N -6 +1 = N -5.\n\nThen, when they shift:\n\nRadha moves 2 places to the left. So her new position from the right would be 6 - 2? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of left positions. Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to track their positions from the left after moving. Let's try that approach.\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha is at left 12. So when she moves 2 places to the right, her new position is 12 + 2 = 14th from the left.\n\nRadha was originally at position (N -5) from the left (since her original right position was 6, so left is N -5). When she moves 2 places to the left, her new left position is (N -5) -2 = N -7. Wait, moving to the left decreases the left position number. Because if you're moving left, you're going towards the start, so the position number decreases. For example, if someone is at position 5 and moves left by 1, they are now at 4. So yes, subtracting 2 from her original left position.\n\nWait, no, actually, when moving to the left, her position number decreases. Let me see. Suppose Radha was at position L from the left. Moving two places left would make her L-2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo after moving, Neha is at 14, Radha is at (N -5 -2) = N -7.\n\nNow, the problem states that after moving, there are 6 children between them. So the distance between them is 6 +1? Wait, the number of children between two people is the difference in their positions minus one. Because if two people are adjacent, there are zero between. So the positions would be, say, 3 and 5: between them is one child (position 4). So the formula would be (position difference) -1 = number of children between. \n\nWait, let me think. Let's say Neha is at position x and Radha at y (assuming x < y). The number of children between them is y - x -1. So if there are 6 between them, then y - x -1 =6 \u2192 y -x =7. \n\nBut the positions could be in either order. Depending on their movement, maybe Radha is to the left or right of Neha. \n\nHmm. So I need to figure out the order of their positions after shifting. Let's see.\n\nOriginal positions: \n\nNeha is at 12 (left), Radha was originally at N-5 (left). So before shifting, where were they relative to each other?\n\nWe need to know if N-5 is to the right or left of 12. Let's see, if N is big enough, like say N=20. Then Radha's original left position would be 15 (20-5), which is to the right of Neha's 12. So in that case, moving Radha left by 2 would take her to 13, and Neha moving right to 14. Wait, in that case, their new positions would be Radha at 13, Neha at 14. Then between them there's zero children, but that's a hypothetical example. \n\nBut in the problem, after moving, there are 6 between them. So the positions must be such that the difference between their positions is 7 (since 6 between would mean difference of 7). \n\nWait, let me think again. Let me denote their new positions as:\n\nNeha's new left position: 14.\n\nRadha's new left position: N -7.\n\nNow, the question is, are these positions ordered in a way that one is to the left or right of the other?\n\nIf N-7 is greater than 14, then Radha is to the right of Neha. The distance between them would be (N-7) -14 = N -21. The number of children between them would be (N-21 -1) = N-22. \n\nAlternatively, if N-7 <14, then Radha is to the left of Neha. The distance between would be 14 - (N-7) = 21 - N, and the children between would be (21 - N -1) = 20 -N. \n\nBut since the number between them is given as 6, so either N-22 =6 or 20 -N =6. \n\nWait but 20 - N would be negative if N is larger than 20, which it probably is. Hmm, perhaps I need to consider which scenario is possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up the equation considering the absolute difference. Let me think again.\n\nThe number of children between them is 6. So the positions must satisfy:\n\nEither:\n\nPosition of Radha (new) - Position of Neha (new) -1 =6 \u2192 (R - N) -1 =6 \u2192 R -N =7 \u2192 R = N +7 (but this can't be since positions can't exceed N). Wait, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the absolute difference between their positions minus 1 equals 6. So |(Radha's new position - Neha's new position)| -1 =6 \u2192 their positions are 7 apart. \n\nSo |(N -7) -14| -1 =6 \u2192 |N -21| -1 =6 \u2192 |N -21|=7 \u2192 N-21=7 \u2192 N=28 or N-21 =-7 \u2192 N=14. \n\nWait but N=14 would be too small. Let me check.\n\nWait, if N-21 =7 \u2192 N=28. If N-21 =-7 \u2192 N=14. Let's see if that makes sense. \n\nFirst, let's check N=28:\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha was 12th from left, so from right she was 28-12+1=17th. \n\nRadha was 6th from right, so her original left position was 28-6+1=23. \n\nAfter moving:\n\nNeha moves right by 2 \u2192 new position 14.\n\nRadha moves left by 2 \u2192 from original 23 to 21 (23-2=21). \n\nSo their new positions are 14 and 21. The distance between them is 21-14=7. So the number of children between them is 7-1=6. Which matches the condition. \n\nSo N=28 is a possible solution. \n\nWhat about N=14? Let's see:\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nRadha's original left position would be N-5 =14-5=9. \n\nNeha is at 12, but total children are 14. So from left, 12 is okay, but Radha is at 9. So original positions would have Neha at 12, Radha at 9? But then moving Radha two to the left would take her to 7. Neha moves to 14. Then the new positions are 7 and 14. The distance between them is 14-7=7, so children between them are 6. That also works. But total N would be 14. However, does that fit the original positions? \n\nWait, let's check Radha's original position from the right. If N is 14, then Radha is 6th from the right, so her left position is 14 -6 +1 =9. Correct. \n\nBut when moving Radha two to the left, from 9 to 7, and Neha moving to 14. Now, the positions are 7 and 14. Between them are 6 children (positions 8-13, which is 6 numbers). So that also works. \n\nHmm, so there are two possible solutions? But that can't be. The problem must have a unique answer. So where did I go wrong?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed constraints. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the case of N=14: \n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha is 12th from left. So in a row of 14, that's possible. But then Radha is at position 9 from the left (since N-5 =9). So in the original arrangement, Neha is at 12, Radha at 9. So Radha is to the left of Neha. When they move, Radha moves two left to 7, Neha moves two right to 14. Now Radha is at 7, Neha at 14. The distance between them is 14-7=7, so 6 between. That works. \n\nBut is there a problem here? The total number of children would be 14. But the options given are 23,27,26,28,29. So 14 isn't among them. Hence, N must be 28. \n\nAh! So that must be the answer. Because the options don't include 14, so the correct one is 28. \n\nWait, but why is there two solutions in my equations? Because when I set |N-21| =7, I get N=28 or 14, but 14 isn't an option. So the answer is 28, option D. \n\nLet me double-check with N=28 again. \n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha is 12 from left. Radha is 6 from right, so her left position is 28-6+1=23. So Radha is at position 23 from left. \n\nAfter moving: Neha moves right to 14, Radha moves left to 21. \n\nNow, positions are 14 (Neha) and 21 (Radha). The distance between them is 21-14=7. So between them are 6 children. That's correct. \n\nSo the answer is D)28. \n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. What if the movement caused them to cross each other? Like, maybe after moving, Radha is to the left of Neha. \n\nWait, in the case of N=28, Radha's new position is 21, which is to the right of Neha's 14. So they are in the same order as before. But in the other scenario, if N were smaller, like say N=20, let's see:\n\nWait, let me pick another number. Suppose N=25. \n\nThen original positions: Radha's left position is 25-5=20. Moving left 2 \u219218. Neha moves to 14. So positions 14 and 18. The distance is 4, so between is 3. Not 6. \n\nHmm. So only when N=28 or 14. Since 14 is not an option, the answer must be 28. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach the problem. Let's try using total positions. \n\nLet me denote the total number as N. \n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha is 12th from left \u2192 her position is 12. \n\nRadha is 6th from right \u2192 her position from left is N -5 (as before). \n\nAfter moving:\n\nNeha is at 12 +2 =14. \n\nRadha is at (N -5) -2 = N-7. \n\nThe distance between them can be calculated as follows. \n\nAssuming that Radha is to the right of Neha after moving (since originally, Radha was at N-5 which is likely to the right of 12 if N is large enough), then the positions would be 14 and N-7. \n\nThe number of children between them is (N-7 -14 -1) = N-22. \n\nSet this equal to 6: N-22=6 \u2192 N=28. \n\nAlternatively, if Radha ends up to the left of Neha, then the distance would be 14 - (N-7) -1 = (21 - N). \n\nSet that equal to 6 \u219221 -N =6 \u2192 N=15. \n\nWait, but that gives N=15, which also wasn't considered earlier. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me see. \n\nWait, the number between them when Radha is left of Neha would be (Neha's position - Radha's position -1). So if Radha is at N-7 and that's less than 14, then N-7 <14 \u2192 N <21. \n\nSo in that case, the number between is 14 - (N-7) -1 =14 -N +7 -1 =20 -N. \n\nSet that to 6 \u219220 -N=6 \u2192N=14. Which is the same as before. \n\nSo the two possibilities are N=28 and N=14. Since 14 isn't an option, the answer must be 28. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D)28.\n",

So if Radha is at N-7 and that's less than 14, then N-7 <14 \u2192 N <21. \n\nSo in that case, the number between is 14 - (N-7) -1 =14 -N +7 -1 =20 -N. \n\nSet that to 6 \u219220 -N=6 \u2192N=14. Which is the same as before. \n\nSo the two possibilities are N=28 and N=14. Since 14 isn't an option, the answer must be 28. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D)28.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote the total number of children as \\( N \\).\n\n**Original Positions:**\n- Neha is 12th from the left end, so her position from the left is \\( 12 \\).\n- Radha is 6th from the right end, so her position from the left is \\( N - 6 + 1 = N - 5 \\).\n\n**After Shifting:**\n- Neha moves 2 places to the right, so her new position from the left is \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\).\n- Radha moves 2 places to the left, so her new position from the left is \\( (N - 5) - 2 = N - 7 \\).\n\n**Distance Between Them:**\nThe problem states there are 6 children between them after the shift. The number of children between two positions \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) (assuming \\( x < y \\)) is \\( y - x - 1 \\). We consider two cases:\n\n1. **Radha is to the right of Neha:**\n   \\[\n   (N - 7) - 14 - 1 = 6 \\implies N - 22 = 6 \\implies N = 28\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Radha is to the left of Neha:**\n   \\[\n   14 - (N - 7) - 1 = 6 \\implies 20 - N = 6 \\implies N = 14\n   \\]\n   \nHowever, \\( N = 14 \\) is not among the provided options. Thus, the valid solution is \\( N = 28 \\).\n\n**Verification for \\( N = 28 \\):**\n- Original positions: Neha at 12, Radha at \\( 28 - 5 = 23 \\).\n- After shifting: Neha at 14, Radha at \\( 28 - 7 = 21 \\).\n- Children between them: \\( 21 - 14 - 1 = 6 \\), which matches the condition.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **D)28**.\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem about Neha and Radha's positions in a row of children. Hmm, I need to figure out the total number of children. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial positions: Neha is 12th from the left end. So her position from the left is 12. Radha is 6th from the right end. So her position from the right is 6. \n\nThen, they shift positions. Radha moves 2 places to the left. So her original position from the right was 6, but moving left would decrease that? Wait, maybe I should think in terms of absolute positions. Maybe it's better to assign variables and set up equations.\n\nLet me denote the total number of children as N. \n\nOriginally, Neha's position from the left is 12. So her position from the right would be N - 12 +1 = N -11. \n\nSimilarly, Radha is 6th from the right, so her position from the left is N -6 +1 = N -5. \n\nWait, that might be important. Let me note that down:\n\nOriginal positions:\nNeha's left position: 12 \u2192 her right position is N -11\nRadha's right position:6 \u2192 her left position is N-5\n\nNow, when they shift: \n\nRadha moves 2 places to the left. So her new left position would be (N -5) -2 = N -7. Because moving left decreases the left position number. Wait, actually, when you move to the left, your position from the left decreases by 2? Wait no, maybe not. Wait, let's think: suppose Radha was originally at position L from the left. If she moves left by two places, her new left position is L - 2. But the initial left position of Radha was N -5, so after moving left two, it becomes (N-5) -2 = N-7. \n\nSimilarly, Neha moves to the right by two places. Her original left position was 12, so moving right two would make it 14. \n\nSo after shifting, Neha is at left position 14, Radha at left position N-7. \n\nNow, the problem states that after the shift, there are 6 children between them. Hmm. The number of children between two positions can be calculated by the difference in their positions minus 1, right? Because if two people are at positions x and y (assuming x < y), the number between them is y - x -1. \n\nWait, but the problem says there are 6 children between them. So the distance between them must be such that the difference between their positions minus 1 equals 6. \n\nBut the order depends on who is on the left. Since Radha moved left and Neha moved right, it's possible that their positions could have crossed? Let me think. \n\nOriginally, Neha was at 12, and Radha was at N-5. Since the total number of children is N, the original positions must have Neha to the left of Radha. So 12 < N-5. Which means N must be greater than 17. \n\nAfter shifting: Neha is at 14, Radha at N-7. Now, we need to see whether Neha is to the left or right of Radha now. \n\nIf N-7 is greater than 14, then Radha is to the right of Neha. Then the distance between them would be (N-7) -14 = N -21. The number of children between them would be (N-21 -1) = N-22. But the problem says there are 6 between them, so N-22=6 \u2192 N=28. \n\nAlternatively, if N-7 <14, then Radha is to the left of Neha. Then the distance between them would be 14 - (N-7) = 21 - N. Then the number between would be (21 - N -1) = 20 - N. But that would have to equal 6, so 20 - N =6 \u2192 N=14, which contradicts the original condition (since N must be >17). So that case isn't possible. \n\nTherefore, the first scenario must be correct where N-7 is greater than 14. So N must be 28. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let's substitute N=28 into the positions. \n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha is 12th from left, so from the right she is 28 -12 +1 =17. \n\nRadha is 6th from the right, so from the left she is 28-6+1=23. \n\nAfter shifting: Radha moves left by 2, so her new left position is 23-2=21. \n\nNeha moves right by 2, so her new left position is 14. \n\nNow the distance between them is 21 (Radha's position) and Neha is at 14? Wait, wait, no. Wait, if Radha is moving left from 23 to 21, then her new left position is 21. Neha is at 14. Wait, so Neha is to the left of Radha. \n\nWait, then the positions are 14 and 21. The number of children between them would be 21-14-1 =6. Oh, that's exactly the 6 children between them. So that works. Wait a second! So in this case, the distance between them is 21-14=7, so between them is 6. So that's correct. \n\nWait, so in this scenario, the total N would be 28? So the answer is D)28? \n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. Let me see if there's another way this could be set up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe when they shift, their positions cross each other. But in this case, the calculation shows that moving from 23 to 21 (Radha's position) and Neha moves from 12 to 14. So Neha is moving towards Radha's original position but not passing her. So their new positions are 14 and 21, so Radha is still to the right of Neha. So the number between them is 21-14-1 =6. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so that would make N=28, which is option D. \n\nWait, but let me check another value. Let's see if another option works. Let's try option C)26. \n\nSuppose N=26. \n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha is 12 from left \u2192 from right: 26-12+1=15. \n\nRadha is 6th from right \u2192 left position is 26-6+1=21. \n\nAfter shifting: Radha moves left to 21-2=19. Neha moves to 14. \n\nDistance between 14 and 19: 19-14-1=4. Not 6. So that's not correct. \n\nOption B:27. Let's try:\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha's right position: 27-12+1=16. \n\nRadha's left position:27-6+1=22. \n\nAfter shifting: Radha is at 22-2=20. Neha at 14. \n\nDistance between 14 and 20: 20-14-1=5. Not 6. \n\nOption E)29: \n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha from right:29-12+1=18. \n\nRadha's left position:29-6+1=24. \n\nAfter moving: Radha to 24-2=22. Neha to 14. \n\nDistance between 14 and22: 22-14-1=7. So children between are 7, which is more than 6. Not correct. \n\nSo the only one that works is 28. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be D)28. Let me just think again if I made any mistake in the setup. \n\nAnother approach: Let's think of the positions after shifting. \n\nAfter moving, Neha is at 14th from left, Radha is at (original position -2) from left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider their positions after shifting and set up the equation based on the total. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of children can be calculated as the position of Neha after shift plus the position of Radha after shift minus their overlapping? Wait, perhaps another way. \n\nAfter shifting, the distance between them is 6 children. So the positions: if Neha is at 14 and Radha at 21 (as in N=28 case), then total length would be up to 28. Because Radha is at 21 from left, so from the right she is 28 -21 +1 =8. Which would be okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way to set up the equation. \n\nThe total number of children is equal to the position of Neha after shift (from left) plus the position of Radha after shift (from right) minus 1. Wait, but maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the positions after shifting: \n\nLet me denote after shifting, Neha is at position Nn and Radha at position Rr (from left). \n\nThe number of children between them is 6, so |Nn - Rr| -1 =6. \n\nAssuming Neha is to the left of Radha, then Rr - Nn -1 =6 \u2192 Rr - Nn =7. \n\nNn is 14 (since she moved right 2 from 12). Rr is (original position of Radha from left) -2. \n\nOriginal position of Radha from left was N -5 (since she was 6th from the right). So Rr = (N-5) -2 = N-7. \n\nSo substituting into the equation: (N-7) -14 =7 \u2192 N-21 =7 \u2192 N=28. \n\nThat's the same result. So this confirms it. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D)28. \n\nI think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key was to set up the equations properly and check all possibilities. The other options don't fit when tested, so D is the one.\n",

So her new left position would be (N -5) -2 = N -7. Because moving left decreases the left position number. Wait, actually, when you move to the left, your position from the left decreases by 2? Wait no, maybe not. Wait, let's think: suppose Radha was originally at position L from the left. If she moves left by two places, her new left position is L - 2. But the initial left position of Radha was N -5, so after moving left two, it becomes (N-5) -2 = N-7. \n\nSimilarly, Neha moves to the right by two places.
