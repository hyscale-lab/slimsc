      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So Charles invested some money, and after one year, he got $54,080 which includes both the principal and the interest. The interest is 8% annually, but compounded semi-annually. I need to find out the original amount he invested. Hmm, right, compound interest formula.\n\nFirst, I remember the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this case, the problem states it's compounded semi-annually, so n should be 2. The time t is 1 year. The annual rate is 8%, so that's 0.08 as a decimal. The amount A after one year is given as $54,080. We need to solve for P.\n\nLet me plug the numbers into the formula. Let's write it out:\n\n54,080 = P * (1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)\n\nSimplify the exponent first. 2*1 is 2. The rate per period is 0.08 divided by 2, which is 0.04. So each compounding period's rate is 4%.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n54,080 = P * (1 + 0.04)^2\n\nCalculating (1.04)^2. Let me compute that. 1.04 squared is... 1.04 times 1.04. Let me do that multiplication. 1 times 1.04 is 1.04, plus 0.04 times 1.04. 0.04*1 is 0.04 and 0.04*0.04 is 0.0016. Adding those gives 0.0416. So total 1.04 + 0.0416 = 1.0816. Wait, no, wait, that might not be right. Let me recalculate 1.04 squared properly. 1.04 * 1.04:\n\n1.04\nx1.04\n--------\nMultiply 1.04 by 4: 4.16\nMultiply 1.04 by 0 (the second digit is the tens place, but since it's .04, the second digit is the tenths? Wait, maybe I should do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, 1.04 squared is (1 + 0.04)^2 = 1 + 2*0.04 + 0.04^2 = 1 + 0.08 + 0.0016 = 1.0816. Oh right, that's correct. So (1.04)^2 is 1.0816.\n\nSo substituting back into the equation:\n\n54,080 = P * 1.0816\n\nTo find P, divide both sides by 1.0816:\n\nP = 54,080 / 1.0816\n\nHmm, I need to calculate that. Let me see. Let's see if I can compute this division. Alternatively, maybe plug in the options to see which one works. Let me check the options given.\n\nThe options are A)45k, B)50k, C)54k, D)59k, E)62k.\n\nLet me try option B, $50,000. Let's see if 50,000 * 1.0816 equals 54,080?\n\n50,000 * 1.0816. Let's compute 50,000 * 1.0816. 50,000 *1 is 50,000. 50,000 * 0.08 is 4,000. 50,000 *0.0016 is 80. So adding those together: 50,000 + 4,000 =54,000 plus 80 is 54,080. Exactly! Oh, so that would mean B is the correct answer. Let me confirm again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps, but let me see.\n\nWait, so if P is 50,000, then:\n\nAfter 6 months, the first compounding: 50,000 * 1.04 = 52,000.\n\nThen, the next 6 months: 52,000 *1.04. Let's compute that. 52,000 * 1.04 is 52,000 + (52,000 *0.04). 52,000 *0.04 is 2,080. So 52,000 + 2,080 is 54,080. Exactly the amount given. So yes, that works. So the principal must be 50,000. So the correct answer is B.\n\nAlternatively, let's check another option just to be sure. Let's say option A: 45,000. Let's compute 45,000 *1.0816. 45,000 *1.08 is 45,000*(1 +0.08)=45,000+ 3,600=48,600. Then adding the 0.0016 part: 45,000 *0.0016=72. So total is 48,600 + 72*100? Wait, maybe better to compute 1.0816 *45,000:\n\n45,000 *1.0816 = ?\n\nAlternatively, 45,000 multiplied by 1.0816:\n\nLet me compute 45,000 *1 =45,000.\n\n45,000 *0.08 = 3,600.\n\n45,000 *0.0016 = 72.\n\nAdding them: 45,000 + 3,600 =48,600 +72 =48,672. Which is way less than 54,080. So A is not correct.\n\nSimilarly, option C: 54,000. Let's see: 54,000 *1.0816. That would be more than 54,080. Let's see:\n\n54,000 *1.0816. Let me compute 54,000 *1 =54,000. 54,000 *0.08 =4,320. 54,000 *0.0016 = 86.4. So total is 54,000 +4,320=58,320 +86.4=58,406.4. Which is higher than the given amount, so not C.\n\nOption D: 59,000. That would give even more. So B is correct. I think that's solid.\n",

So the formula becomes 54080 = P*(1.04)^2. \n\nCalculating (1.04)^2: 1.04 multiplied by 1.04. Let me do that. 1.04 * 1.04. 1*1 is 1, 1*0.04 is 0.04, 0.04*1 is 0.04, and 0.04*0.04 is 0.0016.

So the principal times that gives 54,080, so dividing 54080 by 1.0816 gives the principal. And indeed, 50,000 times 1.0816 is exactly 54,080. That's right. So B is correct.

So the principal times that gives 54,080, so dividing 54080 by 1.0816 gives the principal. And indeed, 50,000 times 1.0816 is exactly 54,080. That's right. So B is correct. The other options: if I had miscalculated, maybe, but I think this is solid. I don't see any errors here.\n\n\nTo determine the original principal amount Charles invested, we use the compound interest formula:  \n\\[\nA = P \\left(1 + \\frac{r}{n}\\right)^{nt}\n\\]  \nGiven:  \n- \\( A = \\$54,080 \\)  \n- Annual interest rate \\( r = 8\\% = 0.08 \\)  \n- Compounded semi-annually (\\( n = 2 \\))  \n- Time \\( t = 1 \\) year  \n\nPlugging in the values:  \n\\[\n54,080 = P \\left(1 + \\frac{0.08}{2}\\right)^{2 \\times 1}\n\\]  \nSimplify the terms inside the parentheses:  \n\\[\n54,080 = P \\left(1 + 0.04\\right)^2\n\\]  \n\\[\n54,080 = P \\times (1.04)^2\n\\]  \nCalculating \\( (1.04)^2 = 1.0816 \\):  \n\\[\n54,080 = P \\times 1.0816\n\\]  \nSolving for \\( P \\):  \n\\[\nP = \\frac{54,080}{1.0816} = 50,000\n\\]  \n\nThus, the original investment amount is \\$50,000, corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
