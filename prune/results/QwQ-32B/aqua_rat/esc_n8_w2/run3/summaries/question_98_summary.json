      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where a man divides Rs 8600 among his sons, daughters, and nephews. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. Each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as each nephew. The question is asking how much each daughter receives. The options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to set this up. Since the problem involves different groups (sons, daughters, nephews) each receiving different amounts based on a common multiple (compared to the nephews), it might be best to let the amount each nephew gets be a variable. Then express the sons' and daughters' shares in terms of that variable, and set up an equation that sums up to the total amount, 8600.\n\nLet me denote the amount each nephew receives as 'x' rupees. Then, each daughter would receive four times that, so 4x. Each son would receive five times the nephew's amount, so 5x. \n\nNow, the number of each group is given: 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. \n\nSo the total amount given to sons would be 5 sons multiplied by 5x each. Wait, no, wait: each son gets 5x, so total for sons is 5*(5x). \n\nSimilarly, daughters: 4 daughters each getting 4x, so total for daughters is 4*(4x). \n\nNephews: 2 nephews each getting x, so total for nephews is 2*x. \n\nAdding all these up should equal 8600. Let me write that equation out.\n\nTotal = (5 * 5x) + (4 * 4x) + (2 * x) = 8600.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step. \n\nFirst, 5 sons each getting 5x: 5*5x = 25x.\n\nThen, 4 daughters each getting 4x: 4*4x = 16x.\n\nThen the nephews: 2x.\n\nAdding them together: 25x + 16x + 2x = (25+16+2)x = 43x. \n\nWait, 25 plus 16 is 41, plus 2 is 43? Wait, no, 25+16 is 41, plus 2 is 43. So total is 43x. \n\nSet equal to 8600: 43x = 8600. \n\nSolving for x: x = 8600 /43. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 43 times 200 is 8600, because 43*200 is 8600. Wait, 43*200: 43*2=86, so 43*200 is 8600. So x is 200. \n\nWait a second, so each nephew gets x = 200. \n\nBut the question asks for how much each daughter receives, which is 4x. \n\nSo 4 times 200 is 800. Wait, that would be option E. But let me check the options again. The options are A)400, B)500, C)600, D)700, E)800. \n\nHmm, so E is 800. But let me double-check my math to be sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the total equation again. \n\nNumber of sons:5, each gets 5x \u2192 5*5x =25x.\n\nDaughters:4, each 4x \u21924*4x=16x.\n\nNephews:2, each x \u21922x.\n\nTotal is 25x +16x +2x =43x. \n\n43x =8600 \u2192 x=8600/43. Let me compute 8600 divided by 43. \n\n43 times 200 is 8600, yes. Because 43*100=4300, so times 2 is 8600. So x is indeed 200. \n\nThen each daughter gets 4x \u21924*200=800. So that would be E. But wait, let me check again if I read the problem correctly. \n\nWait the problem says each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew. So yes, that's 4x. Each son gets five times as a nephew, so 5x. \n\nWait the answer seems straightforward, but let me check if I made any miscalculations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the number of sons, daughters, or nephews. Let me check again. \n\nThe question states: 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. Yes, so the numbers are correct. \n\nHmm. Then the calculation is correct. But why is the option E here? Let me check the options again. \n\nWait, the options include E)800. So that's the correct answer. But let me see if maybe I misread the question. \n\nWait, the problem says \"divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews\". So all of them together. \n\nWait, another way to check: if each nephew gets 200, then each daughter gets 800, each son 1000. \n\nTotal per group:\n\nSons: 5 * 1000 = 5000.\n\nDaughters:4 *800 =3200.\n\nNephews:2*200=400.\n\nTotal sum:5000+3200=8200, plus 400 is 8600. Exactly. \n\nSo that adds up correctly. So the answer should be E) 800. \n\nWait but why is the option C)600 there? Maybe a common mistake. Let me see. \n\nSuppose someone thought that the nephew's share was the same as the daughter's? No. Or perhaps miscalculating the total coefficients. Let me see: 5 sons times 5 is 25, 4 daughters times 4 is 16, 2 nephews times 1. Wait, no, the nephews are x each, so 2x. \n\nWait, another possible mistake: If someone thought the sons get five times the daughters, but the problem states each son gets five times each nephew. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone miscalculates 5 sons each getting 5x, so 25x, but then daughters 4x each, so 16x, and nephews 2x. 25+16+2 is 43, which is right. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is E. But let me check the options again. The options are A)400, B)500, C)600, D)700, E)800. \n\nSo E is the correct choice. \n\nBut wait, the problem might have a trick? Let me read again. \n\nNo, the problem seems straightforward. The key is to set the nephew's share as x, then express others in terms of x, multiply by their numbers, sum to 8600, solve for x, then compute 4x. \n\nYes, that's exactly what I did. So I think the answer is E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in division. Let me check 8600 divided by 43. \n\nLet me compute 43 \u00d7 200: 43 \u00d7 200 is 8600. So yes, 200. So 4x is 800. \n\nSo the answer is E. \n\nWait, but the options given here include E as Rs 800. So the answer must be E. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E.\n",

But wait, the options given here include E as 800, so that's the right answer. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure there's no mistake in my calculation. Let me check again:\n\nTotal from sons: 5 sons * 5x =25x. Daughters: 4 *4x=16x. Nephews: 2x. Total 25+16+2 =43x. 43x=8600 \u2192 x=200. So yes. So each daughter gets 4*200=800. So the correct answer is E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote the amount each nephew receives as \\( x \\). According to the problem, each daughter receives \\( 4x \\) and each son receives \\( 5x \\). \n\nThe total amount distributed can be expressed as:\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = (5 \\text{ sons} \\times 5x) + (4 \\text{ daughters} \\times 4x) + (2 \\text{ nephews} \\times x)\n\\]\nSubstituting the values:\n\\[\n8600 = (5 \\times 5x) + (4 \\times 4x) + (2 \\times x)\n\\]\nSimplifying each term:\n\\[\n8600 = 25x + 16x + 2x\n\\]\n\\[\n8600 = 43x\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{8600}{43} = 200\n\\]\nEach daughter receives \\( 4x \\):\n\\[\n4x = 4 \\times 200 = 800\n\\]\n\nVerifying the total:\n- Sons: \\( 5 \\times 5 \\times 200 = 5000 \\)\n- Daughters: \\( 4 \\times 4 \\times 200 = 3200 \\)\n- Nephews: \\( 2 \\times 200 = 400 \\)\nTotal: \\( 5000 + 3200 + 400 = 8600 \\), which matches the given total.\n\nThus, the amount each daughter receives is **Rs 800**.\n\nAnswer: E",
