      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: there are five consecutive two-digit odd numbers. When their sum is divided by 10, the result is a perfect square. I need to figure out which of the options (A to E) could be one of those five numbers. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the question again. The numbers are consecutive two-digit odd numbers. So they must be like, for example, 11,13,15,17,19 or something like that. Each subsequent number is two more than the previous. The sum of these five numbers divided by 10 gives a perfect square. So, the key is to find such a sequence where this condition holds, then check which of the options is part of that sequence.\n\nLet me denote the five consecutive numbers. Let's call the first number in the sequence as n. Since they are consecutive odd numbers, the sequence would be n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. The sum of these numbers would be 5n + (0+2+4+6+8) = 5n + 20. So total sum is 5n + 20.\n\nDividing that by 10 gives (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2. Wait, hold on. Let me recalculate that. 5n +20 divided by 10 is (5(n +4))/10, which simplifies to (n +4)/2. Hmm, so that expression must be a perfect square.\n\nWait a second, that's an important point. Let me confirm the math again. The sum of five terms starting at n (each increasing by 2):\n\nSum = n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8). Let's add those up:\n\nn + n +2 + n+4 +n+6 +n+8 = 5n + (2+4+6+8) = 5n + 20. Right, so sum is 5n +20. Divided by 10, that's (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2. So yes, (n+4)/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nWait, so (n+4)/2 has to be an integer, because a perfect square is an integer. So (n+4) must be even, meaning that n must be even? Wait no, because n is an odd number (since they are two-digit odd numbers). Wait, hold on. If n is odd, then n+4 would be odd + even = odd. So (n+4) is odd. Then (n+4)/2 would be a fraction. Wait, that can't be a perfect square unless it's an integer. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, the problem says when divided by 10, the result is a perfect square. So the division must result in an integer perfect square. Therefore, the sum must be divisible by 10, and the quotient is a perfect square. So the sum must be a multiple of 10. Let's check again.\n\nThe sum is 5n +20. So 5(n+4). Since 5 is a factor, the sum is divisible by 5. To be divisible by 10, the sum must also be divisible by 2. Therefore, 5(n+4) must be divisible by 2. Since 5 is not divisible by 2, (n+4) must be even. So n+4 is even, so n must be even. But wait, n is a two-digit odd number. Oh! Contradiction here. Because if n is odd, then n+4 is odd + even = odd, so (n+4) is odd. Therefore, 5(n+4) would be divisible by 5 but not by 2, so the sum would not be divisible by 10. Therefore, that would be impossible. Wait, so that can't be. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check again. The numbers are five consecutive two-digit odd numbers. So each number is odd, so the first is n, then n+2, etc. The sum is indeed 5n + (2+4+6+8) = 5n + 20. Wait, 2+4+6+8 is 20? Wait, let's add again:\n\nThe terms are n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. The sum is 5n + (2 +4 +6 +8) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first term is n, the second is n+2, third n+4, fourth n+6, fifth n+8. The total added terms beyond 5n are 2+4+6+8? Wait, no. The sum is n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8). Let me add all the constants:\n\n2 +4 +6 +8 = 20. Wait, yes, because the first term's constant is zero, then adding the rest. So the total sum is indeed 5n +20. \n\nSo the problem states that when this sum is divided by 10, the result is a perfect square. So the sum must be divisible by 10, so 5n +20 must be divisible by 10. 5n +20 = 5(n +4). So 5(n+4) must be divisible by 10. Therefore, (n+4) must be even, so n must be even. But n is an odd number (since the numbers are consecutive odd numbers). So this is a problem. Because n is odd, so n+4 is odd + even = odd. Which is not even. Therefore, 5(n+4) would not be divisible by 10, which contradicts the problem's condition. \n\nWait, that can't be right. The problem must have a solution. So perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nAh! Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me see. Let me think of an example. Let's pick numbers. For example, let's take numbers 11,13,15,17,19. Their sum is 11+13+15+17+19. Let me calculate that: 11+19 is 30, 13+17 is 30, plus 15. Total 30+30+15 = 75. Divided by 10 is 7.5, which isn't a perfect square, so that's not a case. \n\nAnother example: Let's pick numbers 13,15,17,19,21. Sum is 13+15=28, 17+19=36, +21: total 28+36=64 +21=85. Divided by 10 is 8.5, still not integer. \n\nHmm. Maybe the numbers have to be such that their sum is divisible by 10. Let's see. Let me think of the sum 5n +20 must be divisible by 10. So 5(n+4) divisible by 10, so n+4 must be even, so n must be even. But since the numbers are odd, n has to be odd. Contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there is a mistake in my approach?\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-express the problem. Let me see:\n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". So the sum divided by 10 must be an integer perfect square. Therefore, the sum must be 10 times a perfect square. Let me write that as:\n\nSum = 10k\u00b2, where k is an integer.\n\nSo 5n +20 = 10k\u00b2 \u21d2 5(n +4) = 10k\u00b2 \u21d2 n +4 = 2k\u00b2 \u21d2 n = 2k\u00b2 -4.\n\nSince n must be a two-digit odd number. Let's see. \n\nSo n is 2k\u00b2 -4. Since n has to be a two-digit number, let's find possible k values where 2k\u00b2 -4 is between 10 and 99 (since it's a two-digit number). Also, since n must be odd, 2k\u00b2 -4 must be odd. \n\nLet me see: 2k\u00b2 is even, so even minus 4 is even. So 2k\u00b2 -4 is even. But n must be odd. So this is a problem. So this suggests that there is no solution? But the question says there is an answer among the options, so I must have messed up somewhere. \n\nHmm, maybe my initial setup is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are consecutive odd numbers, so the difference between each is 2, so the five numbers can be written as a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8. The sum is 5a + 20. So sum divided by 10 is (5a +20)/10 = (a +4)/2. So this needs to be a perfect square, and also an integer. \n\nTherefore, (a+4)/2 must be an integer and a perfect square. So (a +4) must be even, so a must be even. But a is an odd number. Contradiction again. \n\nThis is a problem. So either the question is wrong, or my approach is wrong. Let me read the question again carefully. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". So maybe \"when divided by 10\" is not implying division, but that the sum is divided by 10? Like, maybe the sum is equal to a perfect square times 10? That's the same as before. \n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that I'm considering five numbers but perhaps they are five consecutive numbers in the sense of consecutive numbers, not consecutive odd numbers? Wait, no, the question says \"5 consecutive two digit odd numbers\", so they must be consecutive odds, so each is two more than previous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let me try plugging in the options. Maybe that's easier. Let's see the options given:\n\nA)47\n\nB)91\n\nC)41\n\nD)67\n\nE)44 (which is even, so can't be in the sequence, so E is out)\n\nSo possible candidates are A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me try each option and see if there exists a sequence where one of them is part of five consecutive odds whose sum divided by 10 is a perfect square.\n\nLet me start with option C)41. Let's see if 41 is part of such a sequence.\n\nAssume 41 is the first number: the sequence would be 41,43,45,47,49. Sum is 41+43+45+47+49. Let's compute:\n\n41+49 =90, 43+47=90, and 45. Total sum is 90+90+45 = 225. Divided by 10 is 22.5, which isn't integer. Not good.\n\nIf 41 is the second number, then the sequence is 39,41,43,45,47. Sum: 39+41+43+45+47. Let's add:\n\n39+47=86, 41+45=86, plus 43. Total 86+86=172 +43=215. 215/10 =21.5, not integer.\n\nIf 41 is the third number: sequence 37,39,41,43,45. Sum: 37+39+41+43+45.\n\n37+45=82, 39+43=82, plus 41. Total 82+82=164 +41=205. 205/10=20.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 41 is fourth: sequence 35,37,39,41,43. Sum: 35+37+39+41+43. Let's see:\n\n35+43=78, 37+41=78, plus 39. Total 78+78=156 +39=195. 195/10 =19.5, not integer.\n\nIf fifth: 33,35,37,39,41. Sum is 33+35+37+39+41. 33+41=74, 35+39=74, plus 37. Total 74+74=148 +37=185. 185/10=18.5, nope.\n\nSo option C)41 doesn't work. Hmm. Let's try A)47.\n\nCheck if 47 is in a sequence. Let's see possibilities.\n\nFirst, if 47 is the first number: the sequence is 47,49,51,53,55. Sum is 47+49+51+53+55. Let's add:\n\n47+55=102, 49+53=102, plus 51. Total 102+102=204 +51=255. 255/10 =25.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 47 is second: then previous numbers start at 45. The sequence is 45,47,49,51,53. Sum: 45+47+49+51+53.\n\n45+53=98, 47+51=98, plus 49. 98+98=196 +49=245. 245 divided by 10 is 24.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 47 is third: sequence is 43,45,47,49,51. Sum: 43+45+47+49+51. Let's calculate:\n\n43+51=94, 45+49=94, plus 47. 94+94=188 +47=235. 235/10=23.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 47 is fourth: sequence starts at 43-2=41? Wait, let's see. The sequence would be 41,43,45,47,49. Wait, that's the same as the first example for 41. Sum is 225. 225/10=22.5. Not integer.\n\nWait, maybe 47 as fifth term? Then the sequence would be 43,45,47,49,51? Wait no, fifth term would be 47, so starting from 43, the fifth term would be 43 + 8 =51. So that's the same as above. Hmm.\n\nHmm. Not working. Let's try option D)67.\n\nCheck 67. Let's see if it's part of a sequence. \n\nFirst, if 67 is first number: 67,69,71,73,75. Sum is 67+69+71+73+75. Let's add:\n\n67+75=142, 69+73=142, plus 71. Total 142+142=284 +71=355. Divided by 10 is 35.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 67 is second term, so first is 65: 65,67,69,71,73. Sum: 65+67+69+71+73. Let's compute:\n\n65+73=138, 67+71=138, plus 69. Total 138+138=276 +69=345. 345/10=34.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 67 is third: sequence starts at 63: 63,65,67,69,71. Sum is 63+65+67+69+71. \n\n63+71=134, 65+69=134, plus 67. 134+134=268 +67=335. 335/10=33.5. Nope.\n\nIf 67 is fourth term: sequence starts at 61: 61,63,65,67,69. Sum is 61+63+65+67+69. \n\n61+69=130, 63+67=130, plus 65. 130+130=260 +65=325. 325 divided by 10 is 32.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 67 is fifth term: sequence is 59,61,63,65,67. Sum is 59+61+63+65+67. \n\n59+67=126, 61+65=126, plus 63. 126+126=252 +63=315. 315/10=31.5. Not integer. \n\nHmm, that's not working either. Let's try B)91. \n\nOption B)91. Since 91 is a two-digit odd number, possible. Let's see. \n\nIf 91 is first term: the sequence would be 91,93,95,97,99. Sum is 91+93+95+97+99. Let me add:\n\n91+99=190, 93+97=190, plus 95. Total 190+190=380 +95=475. 475 divided by 10 is 47.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 91 is second term, then first is 89: 89,91,93,95,97. Sum: 89+91+93+95+97. \n\n89+97=186, 91+95=186, plus 93. 186+186=372 +93=465. 465/10=46.5. Not integer.\n\nThird term: sequence starts at 87: 87,89,91,93,95. Sum is 87+89+91+93+95. \n\n87+95=182, 89+93=182, plus 91. Total 182+182=364 +91=455. 455/10=45.5. No.\n\nFourth term: starting at 85: 85,87,89,91,93. Sum: 85+87+89+91+93. \n\n85+93=178, 87+91=178, plus 89. 178+178=356 +89=445. 445/10=44.5. Nope.\n\nFifth term: 83,85,87,89,91. Sum is 83+85+87+89+91. \n\n83+91=174, 85+89=174, plus 87. 174+174=348 +87=435. 435/10=43.5. Not integer.\n\nHmm, none of those work. Let me check option C again, but maybe I made a mistake. Wait, option C is 41, but I tried all positions. Let me try again for option C's possible sequences. Wait, maybe I missed a position? \n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think of the equation again. \n\nWe have Sum = 5n +20. The sum divided by 10 must be a perfect square, so Sum =10k\u00b2. \n\nThus, 5n +20 =10k\u00b2 \u21d2 n +4 = 2k\u00b2. \n\nSince n is a two-digit odd number, so n must be between 11 and 99 (since it's two-digit and odd). \n\nSo n =2k\u00b2 -4 must be odd. \n\nBut 2k\u00b2 is even, so 2k\u00b2 -4 is even minus even (since 4 is even) \u2192 even. So n is even, which contradicts that n is odd. \n\nWait, so this equation says that n must be even, but n is an odd two-digit number. Therefore, there is no solution? But the problem gives options, so that can't be. \n\nHmm, so where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the setup. Let me check again. \n\nThe numbers are five consecutive odd numbers. Let me denote them as x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8. Then the sum is 5x + 20. Divided by 10 gives (5x+20)/10 = (x +4)/2. \n\nThis must be a perfect square, so (x+4)/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nTherefore, (x+4)/2 = m\u00b2, where m is integer. \n\nThus, x +4 = 2m\u00b2 \u21d2 x = 2m\u00b2 -4. \n\nBut x must be a two-digit odd number. \n\nSo x must be odd, so 2m\u00b2 -4 must be odd. \n\n2m\u00b2 is even, subtract 4 (even) gives even - even = even. \n\nSo x would be even, but that's a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, there is no solution? But the problem must have an answer. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question allows the numbers to be three-digit? But no, it says two-digit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that I considered the first term as x, but maybe the sequence can start with a number where when divided by 10, the result is a perfect square, but not necessarily an integer? But the question says \"becomes a perfect square\", which usually implies an integer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the sum formula. Let me check again. \n\nWait, 5 consecutive odd numbers starting at x:\n\nSum = x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) \n\n=5x + (2+4+6+8) \n\nWait, wait, 2+4+6+8 is 20? Wait, 2+4 is 6, +6 is 12, +8 is 20. Yes. So the sum is indeed 5x+20. \n\nHmm. So according to this, there's a contradiction. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is about five consecutive numbers, but not necessarily consecutive odd numbers. Wait, the question says \"5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers\", so they must be consecutive odds, so the difference of 2. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the division by 10 might result in a perfect square even if it's a fraction, but that's not typical. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, but since it's a question, probably not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not requiring the division to be exact, but just that the result is a perfect square, which could be a fraction? For example, if the sum divided by 10 is 0.25, that's (0.5)^2, but that's not an integer square. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square, but not necessarily an integer. But perfect squares are integers unless specified otherwise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another base? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup, and the numbers are consecutive integers, not consecutive odds? Let me try that. \n\nIf they are five consecutive integers, then the numbers would be x, x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4. \n\nBut they must be two-digit odd numbers. So all five must be odd, which would require that they are spaced by 2, but consecutive integers can't all be odd except for a single pair. \n\nWait, consecutive integers can't have five consecutive odds. So that's impossible. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to five consecutive odd numbers where the numbers are consecutive in the sense of the number sequence, but not necessarily consecutive integers. Like, consecutive in the list of odd numbers. Which is the same as consecutive odds with difference 2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the numbers when divided by 10 individually, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a possible k value where 2m\u00b2 -4 is odd. Wait, how?\n\nWait, x = 2m\u00b2 -4. \n\nSuppose m is a half-integer? Like m = 3/2. Then m\u00b2 is 9/4, so 2*(9/4) = 9/2, minus 4 gives 9/2 - 4 = (9-8)/2 = 1/2. Not integer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps m is sqrt( (x+4)/2 ), so it must be integer. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not in the way I thought. Let me read the question again: \n\n\"The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?\"\n\nWait, \"when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\" \u2014 perhaps \"when the numbers are divided by 10\", but that would be each number divided by 10. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the entire sum is divided by 10. So the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the initial setup. Let me think of possible numbers where the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. Let me try to find such a sequence. \n\nLet me consider that the sum divided by 10 must be a perfect square. Let me think of possible sums. Let me think of perfect squares multiplied by 10. \n\nPossible perfect squares: 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100, etc. So multiplied by 10 gives 10,40,90,160,250, 360, 490, 640, 810, 1000. \n\nThe sum of five two-digit numbers would be between 5*11=55 and 5*99=495. So the possible sums divisible by 10 and perfect squares times 10 would be 10,40,90,160, 250, 360, 490. But 10 is too small (minimum sum 55), so possible sums are 90,160,250,360,490. \n\nNow, check each of these sums and see if they can be expressed as the sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers. \n\nLet's start with 90. \n\nSum =90. The average per number is 18. So the middle term (third number) would be 18. Since they are consecutive odds, the numbers would be 16 (but even?), no. Wait, consecutive odds, so middle term is 18? Wait, but 18 is even. The average of five consecutive odd numbers must be an odd number if the count is odd (since the average is the middle term). Wait, the average of five terms is the third term. \n\nWait, so if the sum is 90, then the average is 18, so the third term must be 18, which is even. Not possible since all numbers are odd. So 90 is invalid. \n\nNext sum 160. Average 32. Third term 32, which is even. Again invalid. \n\nNext 250: average 50. Third term is 50, even. Again no. \n\n360: average 72, even. No. \n\n490: average 98. Even again. \n\nHmm, none of these sums would work, since the average must be an odd number. Wait, the average of five consecutive odd numbers is the middle term, which must be odd. Therefore the sum must be 5*(middle term), so sum must be divisible by 5 and the middle term is an odd number. \n\nWait, but the sum is also supposed to be divisible by 10. So the sum must be divisible by 10. \n\nSo the middle term must be an even number? Because sum =5*(middle term). If sum is divisible by 10, then 5*(middle term) divisible by 10 \u2192 middle term must be even. \n\nBut middle term is part of the sequence of five consecutive odd numbers. The middle term must be odd. Contradiction. \n\nTherefore, there is no such sequence. But the question says there is. \n\nHmm, this is perplexing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the possible sums. Let me see:\n\nWait, the possible perfect squares when multiplied by 10 must be between 55 and 495. Let me recalculate:\n\nPossible perfect squares:\n\n1 \u2192 10 \u2192 too low (sum needs to be at least 55)\n\n4 \u219240 \u2192 too low.\n\n9 \u219290 (sum of 5 numbers, possible?)\n\nWait, 90 as the sum. Let me see if there is a sequence of five two-digit odd numbers adding to 90. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote the middle term as m. Then the numbers are m-4, m-2, m, m+2, m+4. So sum is 5m. \n\nSo 5m =90 \u2192 m=18. But m has to be odd, so no. \n\nSimilarly for 160: 5m=160 \u2192 m=32 (even). \n\n250: m=50 (even). \n\n360: m=72 (even). \n\n490: m=98 (even). \n\nHmm. So all these sums would require the middle term to be even. But since they are odd numbers, the middle term must be odd. So no solution. \n\nTherefore, the problem as stated has no solution? But the options are given, so I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows three-digit numbers? For example, the numbers could be three-digit? But the question says two-digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the consecutive numbers are not necessarily increasing? Like, maybe in some other order? But that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not consecutive in the numerical sense, but consecutive in the sense of consecutive odd numbers, but starting from somewhere else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me re-express the problem again. \n\nLet me think of the five numbers as:\n\nLet me let the numbers be a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8. \n\nSum = 5a +20. \n\nWe require that (5a +20)/10 = (a+4)/2 is a perfect square. \n\nSo (a +4)/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nLet me let (a +4)/2 = k\u00b2. Then a +4 = 2k\u00b2 \u2192 a= 2k\u00b2 -4. \n\nNow, a must be a two-digit odd number. \n\nSo 2k\u00b2 -4 must be odd. \n\nBut 2k\u00b2 is even, so 2k\u00b2 -4 is even minus even, which is even. \n\nThus, a would be even, which contradicts it being an odd two-digit number. \n\nTherefore, there is no solution. \n\nBut the options must have one correct answer. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows the division to result in a perfect square even if it's not an integer? Like 22.5 is 4.743 squared? Not an integer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the sum. Let me try an example where a is even. \n\nSuppose a is even, then the numbers would be even, which is not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a typo and the numbers are even? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question says \"when divided by 5\" instead of 10? Let me see. If divided by 5, then the sum divided by 5 would be (a+4), which needs to be a perfect square. So a +4 = m\u00b2. Then a= m\u00b2 -4. \n\nThen a must be a two-digit odd number. \n\nSo m\u00b2 -4 must be odd, so m\u00b2 must be odd. So m is odd. \n\nPossible m values where m\u00b2 -4 is between 10 and 99 (two-digit). \n\nLet me see m from 4 to 10 (since 10\u00b2 is 100, minus 4 is 96, which is two-digit):\n\nm=3: 9-4=5 (too small, single-digit)\n\nm=5: 25-4=21 \u2192 possible. So a=21. The numbers would be 21,23,25,27,29. Sum is 21+23+25+27+29=125. Divided by 5 is 25, which is 5 squared. \n\nThen one of the numbers is 21,23,25,27,29. The options given are 47,91,41,67. None of these are in this sequence. \n\nNext m=7: 49-4=45. a=45. The sequence 45,47,49,51,53. Sum is 45+47+49+51+53. Let's compute: 45+53=98, 47+51=98, plus 49. Total 98+98=196 +49=245. Divided by 5 is 49, which is 7 squared. \n\nSo the numbers here are 45,47,49,51,53. Among these, 47 is option A. So if the question had said divided by 5, then A would be the answer. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the question has a typo and should be divided by 5? Because that would make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's division. Let me check the question again. \n\nOriginal question: \"The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from an non-English source, and \"divided by\" is mistranslated. Like, maybe it's divided by 10, but the division is integer division (floor). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the perfect square to be a square of a fraction, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the options given. Let's see option A)47 is in the sequence I just found (45,47,49,51,53) which sum is 245. 245 divided by 10 is 24.5. Not a perfect square. But divided by 5 gives 49. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says \"when divided by 5\" instead of 10. If that were the case, then option A)47 would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant the sum plus 10, or some other operation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that when divided by 10, the quotient is a perfect square, but it could be a decimal perfect square? Like 25.0, but 25 is integer. \n\nWait, let me think of any possible sequence where (a+4)/2 is a perfect square. \n\nSuppose (a+4)/2 = 25 \u2192 a+4=50 \u2192 a=46. But a must be odd. \n\nIf (a+4)/2 = 16 \u2192 a+4=32 \u2192 a=28 even. \n\nIf (a+4)/2 = 9 \u2192 a=14 \u2192 even. \n\nIf (a+4)/2=4 \u2192 a=4 \u2192 too small. \n\nIf (a+4)/2=25 \u2192 a=46 even. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe (a+4)/2 is a perfect square but fractional? Like 0.25, but that would be 0.5 squared. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct and I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. \n\nSuppose the five numbers are x-8, x-6, x-4, x-2, x. \n\nThen the sum is 5x - 20. \n\nDivided by 10 gives (5x-20)/10 = (x-4)/2. \n\nThis must be a perfect square. \n\nSo (x-4)/2 =k\u00b2 \u2192x=2k\u00b2 +4. \n\nx must be a two-digit odd number. \n\nThus, 2k\u00b2 +4 must be odd. \n\n2k\u00b2 is even, plus 4 (even) gives even. So x would be even, again contradiction. \n\nSame problem. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is of five consecutive odd numbers but starting at an even number? But that can't be, since they are odd. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are not in the form of x, x+2, etc., but in some other way? \n\nWait, perhaps the consecutive odd numbers are consecutive in the sense of the number line, but not necessarily in the sequence. Like, any five odds with difference 2 between each. Which is what I already considered. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum calculation. Let me try with the option D)67. \n\nSuppose the numbers are 63,65,67,69,71. \n\nSum is 63+65+67+69+71. Let's compute:\n\n63+71=134, 65+69=134, plus 67. 134+134=268 +67=335. \n\n335 divided by 10 is 33.5. Not a perfect square. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is 57,59,61,63,65. Their sum is 57+59+61+63+65. \n\n57+65=122, 59+63=122, plus 61. 122+122=244 +61=305. 305/10=30.5. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of perfect squares that when multiplied by 10 give a possible sum. \n\nFor example, 25 *10=250. Let me see if there is a sequence of five consecutive odd numbers adding to 250. \n\nThe average would be 50, so middle term 50. But that's even, so no. \n\nAlternatively, 225 divided by 10 is 22.5, not square. \n\nWait, what if the sum is 250? As before. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the numbers to be three-digit? Let me see. \n\nIf the numbers can be three-digit, then maybe a= 2k\u00b2-4. Let's see for k=8: 2*64 -4 = 124. Then the numbers would be 124,126, etc. but they need to be odd. \n\nWait, a has to be odd. So for a to be odd, 2k\u00b2-4 must be odd \u2192 2k\u00b2 must be odd +4 \u2192 but 2k\u00b2 is even. \n\nThus, no. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a different problem where the division is by 5, leading to answer A. Since in that case, the sequence 45,47,49,51,53 has sum 245 divided by5 is 49, which is 7 squared. So 47 is option A. \n\nSince the options include 47, perhaps the question had a typo and the correct answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sum formula. Let me check once more. \n\nWait, let me try with the sequence starting at 15: 15,17,19,21,23. Sum is 15+17+19+21+23. Let's calculate:\n\n15+23=38, 17+21=38, plus 19. Total 38+38=76 +19=95. 95 divided by10 is 9.5. Not a perfect square. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let's see what happens if the sum is 450. Divided by 10 is 45. Not a square. \n\nWait, 490 divided by 10 is 49, which is a perfect square. The sum would be 490. So let's see if there is a sequence of five two-digit odd numbers adding to 490. \n\nThe average is 98, so the middle term must be 98. But that's even. So numbers would have to be 94,96,98,100,102. But those are not two-digit numbers except the first two. 100 is three-digit. \n\nThus, not possible. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question allows the perfect square to be a cube? No, the question says square. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in base 9 or something? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct and the answer is option B)91, but I made a mistake in calculations. Let me check 91 again. \n\nSuppose the numbers are 85,87,89,91,93. Their sum is 85+87+89+91+93. \n\nAdding: 85+93=178, 87+91=178, plus 89. \n\nTotal 178+178=356 +89=445. 445/10=44.5. Not perfect square. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are not starting from the first one, but somewhere else. Wait, maybe I need to find any possible sequence where the sum divided by 10 is a square. Let me think of a possible square. Let's say 25. 25*10=250. The sum must be 250. \n\nSo the average is 50. The middle term is 50, which is even, so no. \n\nAnother square is 36. 36*10=360. Sum 360. Average 72. Again even. \n\nAnother square is 49 \u2192 490. As before. \n\nSquare 16 \u2192 160. Sum 160. Average 32. \n\nSquare 9 \u2192 90. \n\nSquare 64 \u2192640. Too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the perfect square is 0.25, so the sum is 2.5. But that's way too small. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a mistake. But since this is a multiple choice question, maybe one of the options works even if my logic says it shouldn't. \n\nLooking back at the options, E)44 is even, so can't be. So possible answers are A-D. \n\nLet me check the option C)41 again. \n\nSuppose the sequence is 39,41,43,45,47. The sum is 39+41+43+45+47. \n\n39+47=86, 41+45=86, plus 43. \n\nTotal 86+86=172+43=215. 215/10=21.5. Not square. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption D)67. Let's think of a different sequence. \n\nSuppose the numbers are 65,67,69,71,73. Sum is 65+67+69+71+73. \n\n65+73=138, 67+71=138, plus 69. \n\nTotal 138+138=276+69=345. 345/10=34.5. Not square. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the numbers are not starting from the first term but in between? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct and there is a sequence where n is even, but the numbers are allowed to be even? But no, the question states two-digit odd numbers. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think of the numbers as being the five consecutive odd numbers but not starting with the first one. Wait, no, that doesn't change anything. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that the sum is divided by 10 and the remainder is a perfect square. But that interpretation is not what the question says. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says \"when divided by 10\" as in quotient, not the entire division. Like, the quotient is a perfect square, but the remainder can be anything. But that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a language where \"divided by\" can mean something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct but I'm missing a possible k value where the number is in the sequence. \n\nWait, let me try k=5. \n\nSo k\u00b2=25. Then (a+4)/2=25 \u2192 a=46, which is even. Not allowed. \n\nk=4 \u2192 (a+4)/2=16 \u2192 a=32 even. \n\nk=3 \u2192 9 \u2192 a=14 even. \n\nk=2 \u21924 \u2192a=4 \u2192 too small. \n\nk=6 \u219236 \u2192 a=68 even. \n\nk=7 \u219249 \u2192 a=94 even. \n\nSo no solution. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows three-digit numbers? Let me see for k=7, a=2*(7)^2-4= 2*49-4=94. The sequence is 94,96,98,100,102. But those are not two-digit except 94,96,98. \n\nThe sum would be 94+96+98+100+102. That's way over two-digit numbers. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, this is very confusing. Maybe the answer is option A)47 because when you consider that the sum divided by 10 gives 24.5, but maybe they consider the integer part? 24, which is 4.898\u2026 no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question had a mistake and the correct answer is option A, as in my earlier example where divided by5 gives a square. Since 47 is in that sequence, and the options include it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's division. Let me see if any of the options when plugged into the equation gives a square. \n\nLet me try option A)47. Let me assume that 47 is the third term. So the sequence is 43,45,47,49,51. Sum is 43+45+47+49+51. \n\n43+51=94, 45+49=94, plus 47. Total 94+94=188+47=235. 235 divided by10 is23.5. \n\nNot a square. \n\nAlternatively, if 47 is the second term: the sequence is 45,47,49,51,53. Sum is 45+47+49+51+53=245. 245/10=24.5. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, 245 divided by 5 is 49. So if the question had division by5, then 49 is a square, and 47 is in the sequence. \n\nMaybe the question had a typo. Given that option A is present and this is a common mistake, perhaps the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant to say divided by 5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and I missed a sequence. Let me think of the sum being 500. 500/10=50, not a square. \n\nWait, 1225 divided by10 is 122.5. No. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are not five consecutive odd numbers but five consecutive numbers which happen to be odd. Which would mean they are spaced by 2. So the same as before. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that all my calculations lead to a contradiction unless there's a typo, but the options include A, which would be correct if divided by5, I'll go with option A)47 as the answer, assuming a possible typo in the problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation. Let me re-express the sum divided by 10 equals a perfect square. \n\nSum is 5n+20. So (5n+20)/10 = (n +4)/2. \n\nSuppose (n+4)/2 = m\u00b2, so n = 2m\u00b2 -4. \n\nEven n, but must be odd. \n\nThus, no solution. \n\nSo the question must have a mistake. But since I have to choose from the options, maybe the closest is option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question allows the division to be a perfect square even if it's not an integer. For example, 22.5 is not a perfect square, but maybe they consider it as (4.743)^2? No, that's not an integer. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are three-digit. Let's try m=8 gives n=2*64-4=124. The sequence would be 124,126,128,130,132. But they are even numbers. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider negative numbers? Like two-digit numbers can be negative? But two-digit numbers are usually between 10 and 99. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is perplexing. Given that I have to choose from the options, and option A is part of a sequence that gives a perfect square when divided by 5, I think the most plausible answer is A)47. So I'll go with that.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem requires finding one of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: there are five consecutive two-digit odd numbers. When their sum is divided by 10, the result is a perfect square. I need to figure out which of the options (A to E) could be one of those five numbers. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the question again. The numbers are consecutive two-digit odd numbers. So they must be like, for example, 11,13,15,17,19 or something like that. Each subsequent number is two more than the previous. The sum of these five numbers divided by 10 gives a perfect square. So, the key is to find such a sequence where this condition holds, then check which of the options is part of that sequence.\n\nLet me denote the five consecutive numbers. Let's call the first number in the sequence as n. Since they are consecutive odd numbers, the sequence would be n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. The sum of these numbers would be 5n + (0+2+4+6+8) = 5n + 20. So total sum is 5n + 20.\n\nDividing that by 10 gives (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2. Wait, hold on. Let me recalculate that. 5n +20 divided by 10 is (5(n +4))/10, which simplifies to (n +4)/2. Hmm, so that expression must be a perfect square.\n\nWait a second, that's an important point. Let me confirm the math again. The sum of five terms starting at n (each increasing by 2):\n\nSum = n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8). Let's add those up:\n\nn + n +2 + n+4 +n+6 +n+8 = 5n + (2+4+6+8) = 5n + 20. Right, so sum is 5n +20. Divided by 10, that's (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2. So yes, (n+4)/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nWait, so (n+4)/2 has to be an integer, because a perfect square is an integer. So (n+4) must be even, meaning that n must be even? Wait no, because n is an odd number (since they are two-digit odd numbers). Wait, hold on. If n is odd, then n+4 would be odd + even = odd. So (n+4) is odd. Then (n+4)/2 would be a fraction. Wait, that can't be a perfect square unless it's an integer. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, the problem says when divided by 10, the result is a perfect square. So the division must result in an integer perfect square. Therefore, the sum must be divisible by 10, and the quotient is a perfect square. So the sum must be a multiple of 10. Let's check again.\n\nThe sum is 5n +20. So 5(n+4). Since 5 is a factor, the sum is divisible by 5. To be divisible by 10, the sum must also be divisible by 2. Therefore, 5(n+4) must be divisible by 2. Since 5 is not divisible by 2, (n+4) must be even. So n+4 is even, so n must be even. But wait, n is a two-digit odd number. Oh! Contradiction here. Because if n is odd, then n+4 is odd + even = odd, so (n+4) is odd. Therefore, 5(n+4) would be divisible by 5 but not by 2, so the sum would not be divisible by 10. Therefore, that would be impossible. Wait, so that can't be. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check again. The numbers are five consecutive two-digit odd numbers. So each number is odd, so the first is n, then n+2, etc. The sum is indeed 5n + (2+4+6+8) = 5n + 20. Wait, 2+4+6+8 is 20? Wait, let's add again:\n\nThe terms are n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. The sum is 5n + (2 +4 +6 +8) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the first term is n, the second is n+2, third n+4, fourth n+6, fifth n+8. The total added terms beyond 5n are 2+4+6+8? Wait, no. The sum is n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8). Let me add all the constants:\n\n2 +4 +6 +8 = 20. Wait, yes, because the first term's constant is zero, then adding the rest. So the total sum is indeed 5n +20. \n\nSo the problem states that when this sum is divided by 10, the result is a perfect square. So the sum must be divisible by 10, so 5n +20 must be divisible by 10. 5n +20 = 5(n +4). So 5(n+4) must be divisible by 10. Therefore, (n+4) must be even, so n must be even. But n is an odd number (since the numbers are consecutive odd numbers). So this is a problem. Because n is odd, so n+4 is odd + even = odd. Which is not even. Therefore, 5(n+4) would not be divisible by 10, which contradicts the problem's condition. \n\nWait, that can't be right. The problem must have a solution. So perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nAh! Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me see. Let me think of an example. Let's pick numbers. For example, let's take numbers 11,13,15,17,19. Their sum is 11+13+15+17+19. Let me calculate that: 11+19 is 30, 13+17 is 30, plus 15. Total 30+30+15 = 75. Divided by 10 is 7.5, which isn't a perfect square, so that's not a case. \n\nAnother example: Let's pick numbers 13,15,17,19,21. Sum is 13+15=28, 17+19=36, +21: total 28+36=64 +21=85. Divided by 10 is 8.5, still not integer. \n\nHmm. Maybe the numbers have to be such that their sum is divisible by 10. Let's see. Let me think of the sum 5n +20 must be divisible by 10. So 5(n+4) divisible by 10, so n+4 must be even, so n must be even. But since the numbers are odd, n has to be odd. Contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there is a mistake in my approach?\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-express the problem. Let me see:\n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". So the sum divided by 10 must be an integer perfect square. Therefore, the sum must be 10 times a perfect square. Let me write that as:\n\nSum = 10k\u00b2, where k is an integer.\n\nSo 5n +20 = 10k\u00b2 \u21d2 5(n +4) = 10k\u00b2 \u21d2 n +4 = 2k\u00b2 \u21d2 n = 2k\u00b2 -4.\n\nSince n must be a two-digit odd number. Let's see. \n\nSo n is 2k\u00b2 -4. Since n has to be a two-digit number, let's find possible k values where 2k\u00b2 -4 is between 10 and 99 (since it's a two-digit number). Also, since n must be odd, 2k\u00b2 -4 must be odd. \n\nLet me see: 2k\u00b2 is even, so even minus 4 is even. So 2k\u00b2 -4 is even. But n must be odd. So this is a problem. So this suggests that there is no solution? But the question says there is an answer among the options, so I must have messed up somewhere. \n\nHmm, maybe my initial setup is wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are consecutive odd numbers, so the difference between each is 2, so the five numbers can be written as a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8. The sum is 5a + 20. So sum divided by 10 is (5a +20)/10 = (a +4)/2. So this needs to be a perfect square, and also an integer. \n\nTherefore, (a+4)/2 must be an integer and a perfect square. So (a +4) must be even, so a must be even. But a is an odd number. Contradiction again. \n\nThis is a problem. So either the question is wrong, or my approach is wrong. Let me read the question again carefully. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". So maybe \"when divided by 10\" is not implying division, but that the sum is divided by 10? Like, maybe the sum is equal to a perfect square times 10? That's the same as before. \n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that I'm considering five numbers but perhaps they are five consecutive numbers in the sense of consecutive numbers, not consecutive odd numbers? Wait, no, the question says \"5 consecutive two digit odd numbers\", so they must be consecutive odds, so each is two more than previous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let me try plugging in the options. Maybe that's easier. Let's see the options given:\n\nA)47\n\nB)91\n\nC)41\n\nD)67\n\nE)44 (which is even, so can't be in the sequence, so E is out)\n\nSo possible candidates are A, B, C, D.\n\nLet me try each option and see if there exists a sequence where one of them is part of five consecutive odds whose sum divided by 10 is a perfect square.\n\nLet me start with option C)41. Let's see if 41 is part of such a sequence.\n\nAssume 41 is the first number: the sequence would be 41,43,45,47,49. Sum is 41+43+45+47+49. Let's compute:\n\n41+49 =90, 43+47=90, and 45. Total sum is 90+90+45 = 225. Divided by 10 is 22.5, which isn't integer. Not good.\n\nIf 41 is the second number, then the sequence is 39,41,43,45,47. Sum: 39+41+43+45+47. Let's add:\n\n39+47=86, 41+45=86, plus 43. Total 86+86=172 +43=215. 215/10 =21.5, not integer.\n\nIf 41 is the third number: sequence 37,39,41,43,45. Sum: 37+39+41+43+45.\n\n37+45=82, 39+43=82, plus 41. Total 82+82=164 +41=205. 205/10=20.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 41 is fourth: sequence 35,37,39,41,43. Sum: 35+37+39+41+43. Let's see:\n\n35+43=78, 37+41=78, plus 39. Total 78+78=156 +39=195. 195/10 =19.5, not integer.\n\nIf fifth: 33,35,37,39,41. Sum is 33+35+37+39+41. 33+41=74, 35+39=74, plus 37. Total 74+74=148 +37=185. 185/10=18.5, nope.\n\nSo option C)41 doesn't work. Hmm. Let's try A)47.\n\nCheck if 47 is in a sequence. Let's see possibilities.\n\nFirst, if 47 is the first number: the sequence is 47,49,51,53,55. Sum is 47+49+51+53+55. Let's add:\n\n47+55=102, 49+53=102, plus 51. Total 102+102=204 +51=255. 255/10 =25.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 47 is second: then previous numbers start at 45. The sequence is 45,47,49,51,53. Sum: 45+47+49+51+53.\n\n45+53=98, 47+51=98, plus 49. 98+98=196 +49=245. 245 divided by 10 is 24.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 47 is third: sequence is 43,45,47,49,51. Sum: 43+45+47+49+51. Let's calculate:\n\n43+51=94, 45+49=94, plus 47. 94+94=188 +47=235. 235/10=23.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 47 is fourth: sequence starts at 43-2=41? Wait, let's see. The sequence would be 41,43,45,47,49. Wait, that's the same as the first example for 41. Sum is 225. 225/10=22.5. Not integer.\n\nWait, maybe 47 as fifth term? Then the sequence would be 43,45,47,49,51? Wait no, fifth term would be 47, so starting from 43, the fifth term would be 43 + 8 =51. So that's the same as above. Hmm.\n\nHmm. Not working. Let's try option D)67.\n\nCheck 67. Let's see if it's part of a sequence. \n\nFirst, if 67 is first number: 67,69,71,73,75. Sum is 67+69+71+73+75. Let's add:\n\n67+75=142, 69+73=142, plus 71. Total 142+142=284 +71=355. Divided by 10 is 35.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 67 is second term, so first is 65: 65,67,69,71,73. Sum: 65+67+69+71+73. Let's compute:\n\n65+73=138, 67+71=138, plus 69. Total 138+138=276 +69=345. 345/10=34.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 67 is third: sequence starts at 63: 63,65,67,69,71. Sum is 63+65+67+69+71. \n\n63+71=134, 65+69=134, plus 67. 134+134=268 +67=335. 335/10=33.5. Nope.\n\nIf 67 is fourth term: sequence starts at 61: 61,63,65,67,69. Sum is 61+63+65+67+69. \n\n61+69=130, 63+67=130, plus 65. 130+130=260 +65=325. 325 divided by 10 is 32.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 67 is fifth term: sequence is 59,61,63,65,67. Sum is 59+61+63+65+67. \n\n59+67=126, 61+65=126, plus 63. 126+126=252 +63=315. 315/10=31.5. Not integer. \n\nHmm, that's not working either. Let's try B)91. \n\nOption B)91. Since 91 is a two-digit odd number, possible. Let's see. \n\nIf 91 is first term: the sequence would be 91,93,95,97,99. Sum is 91+93+95+97+99. Let me add:\n\n91+99=190, 93+97=190, plus 95. Total 190+190=380 +95=475. 475 divided by 10 is 47.5. Not integer.\n\nIf 91 is second term, then first is 89: 89,91,93,95,97. Sum: 89+91+93+95+97. \n\n89+97=186, 91+95=186, plus 93. 186+186=372 +93=465. 465/10=46.5. Not integer.\n\nThird term: sequence starts at 87: 87,89,91,93,95. Sum is 87+89+91+93+95. \n\n87+95=182, 89+93=182, plus 91. Total 182+182=364 +91=455. 455/10=45.5. No.\n\nFourth term: starting at 85: 85,87,89,91,93. Sum: 85+87+89+91+93. \n\n85+93=178, 87+91=178, plus 89. 178+178=356 +89=445. 445/10=44.5. Nope.\n\nFifth term: 83,85,87,89,91. Sum is 83+85+87+89+91. \n\n83+91=174, 85+89=174, plus 87. 174+174=348 +87=435. 435/10=43.5. Not integer.\n\nHmm, none of those work. Let me check option C again, but maybe I made a mistake. Wait, option C is 41, but I tried all positions. Let me try again for option C's possible sequences. Wait, maybe I missed a position? \n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me think of the equation again. \n\nWe have Sum = 5n +20. The sum divided by 10 must be a perfect square, so Sum =10k\u00b2. \n\nThus, 5n +20 =10k\u00b2 \u21d2 n +4 = 2k\u00b2. \n\nSince n is a two-digit odd number, so n must be between 11 and 99 (since it's two-digit and odd). \n\nSo n =2k\u00b2 -4 must be odd. \n\nBut 2k\u00b2 is even, so 2k\u00b2 -4 is even minus even (since 4 is even) \u2192 even. So n is even, which contradicts that n is odd. \n\nWait, so this equation says that n must be even, but n is an odd two-digit number. Therefore, there is no solution? But the problem gives options, so that can't be. \n\nHmm, so where is the mistake here?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the setup. Let me check again. \n\nThe numbers are five consecutive odd numbers. Let me denote them as x, x+2, x+4, x+6, x+8. Then the sum is 5x + 20. Divided by 10 gives (5x+20)/10 = (x +4)/2. \n\nThis must be a perfect square, so (x+4)/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nTherefore, (x+4)/2 = m\u00b2, where m is integer. \n\nThus, x +4 = 2m\u00b2 \u21d2 x = 2m\u00b2 -4. \n\nBut x must be a two-digit odd number. \n\nSo x must be odd, so 2m\u00b2 -4 must be odd. \n\n2m\u00b2 is even, subtract 4 (even) gives even - even = even. \n\nSo x would be even, but that's a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, there is no solution? But the problem must have an answer. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question allows the numbers to be three-digit? But no, it says two-digit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that I considered the first term as x, but maybe the sequence can start with a number where when divided by 10, the result is a perfect square, but not necessarily an integer? But the question says \"becomes a perfect square\", which usually implies an integer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the sum formula. Let me check again. \n\nWait, 5 consecutive odd numbers starting at x:\n\nSum = x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) + (x+8) \n\n=5x + (2+4+6+8) \n\nWait, wait, 2+4+6+8 is 20? Wait, 2+4 is 6, +6 is 12, +8 is 20. Yes. So the sum is indeed 5x+20. \n\nHmm. So according to this, there's a contradiction. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is about five consecutive numbers, but not necessarily consecutive odd numbers. Wait, the question says \"5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers\", so they must be consecutive odds, so the difference of 2. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the division by 10 might result in a perfect square even if it's a fraction, but that's not typical. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, but since it's a question, probably not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not requiring the division to be exact, but just that the result is a perfect square, which could be a fraction? For example, if the sum divided by 10 is 0.25, that's (0.5)^2, but that's not an integer square. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square, but not necessarily an integer. But perfect squares are integers unless specified otherwise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another base? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the setup, and the numbers are consecutive integers, not consecutive odds? Let me try that. \n\nIf they are five consecutive integers, then the numbers would be x, x+1, x+2, x+3, x+4. \n\nBut they must be two-digit odd numbers. So all five must be odd, which would require that they are spaced by 2, but consecutive integers can't all be odd except for a single pair. \n\nWait, consecutive integers can't have five consecutive odds. So that's impossible. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to five consecutive odd numbers where the numbers are consecutive in the sense of the number sequence, but not necessarily consecutive integers. Like, consecutive in the list of odd numbers. Which is the same as consecutive odds with difference 2. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the numbers when divided by 10 individually, but that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a possible k value where 2m\u00b2 -4 is odd. Wait, how?\n\nWait, x = 2m\u00b2 -4. \n\nSuppose m is a half-integer? Like m = 3/2. Then m\u00b2 is 9/4, so 2*(9/4) = 9/2, minus 4 gives 9/2 - 4 = (9-8)/2 = 1/2. Not integer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps m is sqrt( (x+4)/2 ), so it must be integer. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not in the way I thought. Let me read the question again: \n\n\"The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square, which of the following can be one of these 5 numbers?\"\n\nWait, \"when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\" \u2014 perhaps \"when the numbers are divided by 10\", but that would be each number divided by 10. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, the entire sum is divided by 10. So the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the initial setup. Let me think of possible numbers where the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. Let me try to find such a sequence. \n\nLet me consider that the sum divided by 10 must be a perfect square. Let me think of possible sums. Let me think of perfect squares multiplied by 10. \n\nPossible perfect squares: 1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100, etc. So multiplied by 10 gives 10,40,90,160,250, 360, 490, 640, 810, 1000. \n\nThe sum of five two-digit numbers would be between 5*11=55 and 5*99=495. So the possible sums divisible by 10 and perfect squares times 10 would be 10,40,90,160, 250, 360, 490. But 10 is too small (minimum sum 55), so possible sums are 90,160,250,360,490. \n\nNow, check each of these sums and see if they can be expressed as the sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers. \n\nLet's start with 90. \n\nSum =90. The average per number is 18. So the middle term (third number) would be 18. Since they are consecutive odds, the numbers would be 16 (but even?), no. Wait, consecutive odds, so middle term is 18? Wait, but 18 is even. The average of five consecutive odd numbers must be an odd number if the count is odd (since the average is the middle term). Wait, the average of five terms is the third term. \n\nWait, so if the sum is 90, then the average is 18, so the third term must be 18, which is even. Not possible since all numbers are odd. So 90 is invalid. \n\nNext sum 160. Average 32. Third term 32, which is even. Again invalid. \n\nNext 250: average 50. Third term is 50, even. Again no. \n\n360: average 72, even. No. \n\n490: average 98. Even again. \n\nHmm, none of these sums would work, since the average must be an odd number. Wait, the average of five consecutive odd numbers is the middle term, which must be odd. Therefore the sum must be 5*(middle term), so sum must be divisible by 5 and the middle term is an odd number. \n\nWait, but the sum is also supposed to be divisible by 10. So the sum must be divisible by 10. \n\nSo the middle term must be an even number? Because sum =5*(middle term). If sum is divisible by 10, then 5*(middle term) divisible by 10 \u2192 middle term must be even. \n\nBut middle term is part of the sequence of five consecutive odd numbers. The middle term must be odd. Contradiction. \n\nTherefore, there is no such sequence. But the question says there is. \n\nHmm, this is perplexing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the possible sums. Let me see:\n\nWait, the possible perfect squares when multiplied by 10 must be between 55 and 495. Let me recalculate:\n\nPossible perfect squares:\n\n1 \u2192 10 \u2192 too low (sum needs to be at least 55)\n\n4 \u219240 \u2192 too low.\n\n9 \u219290 (sum of 5 numbers, possible?)\n\nWait, 90 as the sum. Let me see if there is a sequence of five two-digit odd numbers adding to 90. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote the middle term as m. Then the numbers are m-4, m-2, m, m+2, m+4. So sum is 5m. \n\nSo 5m =90 \u2192 m=18. But m has to be odd, so no. \n\nSimilarly for 160: 5m=160 \u2192 m=32 (even). \n\n250: m=50 (even). \n\n360: m=72 (even). \n\n490: m=98 (even). \n\nHmm. So all these sums would require the middle term to be even. But since they are odd numbers, the middle term must be odd. So no solution. \n\nTherefore, the problem as stated has no solution? But the options are given, so I must have made a mistake. \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows three-digit numbers? For example, the numbers could be three-digit? But the question says two-digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the consecutive numbers are not necessarily increasing? Like, maybe in some other order? But that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not consecutive in the numerical sense, but consecutive in the sense of consecutive odd numbers, but starting from somewhere else. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me re-express the problem again. \n\nLet me think of the five numbers as:\n\nLet me let the numbers be a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8. \n\nSum = 5a +20. \n\nWe require that (5a +20)/10 = (a+4)/2 is a perfect square. \n\nSo (a +4)/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nLet me let (a +4)/2 = k\u00b2. Then a +4 = 2k\u00b2 \u2192 a= 2k\u00b2 -4. \n\nNow, a must be a two-digit odd number. \n\nSo 2k\u00b2 -4 must be odd. \n\nBut 2k\u00b2 is even, so 2k\u00b2 -4 is even minus even, which is even. \n\nThus, a would be even, which contradicts it being an odd two-digit number. \n\nTherefore, there is no solution. \n\nBut the options must have one correct answer. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows the division to result in a perfect square even if it's not an integer? Like 22.5 is 4.743 squared? Not an integer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating the sum. Let me try an example where a is even. \n\nSuppose a is even, then the numbers would be even, which is not allowed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question has a typo and the numbers are even? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question says \"when divided by 5\" instead of 10? Let me see. If divided by 5, then the sum divided by 5 would be (a+4), which needs to be a perfect square. So a +4 = m\u00b2. Then a= m\u00b2 -4. \n\nThen a must be a two-digit odd number. \n\nSo m\u00b2 -4 must be odd, so m\u00b2 must be odd. So m is odd. \n\nPossible m values where m\u00b2 -4 is between 10 and 99 (two-digit). \n\nLet me see m from 4 to 10 (since 10\u00b2 is 100, minus 4 is 96, which is two-digit):\n\nm=3: 9-4=5 (too small, single-digit)\n\nm=5: 25-4=21 \u2192 possible. So a=21. The numbers would be 21,23,25,27,29. Sum is 21+23+25+27+29=125. Divided by 5 is 25, which is 5 squared. \n\nThen one of the numbers is 21,23,25,27,29. The options given are 47,91,41,67. None of these are in this sequence. \n\nNext m=7: 49-4=45. a=45. The sequence 45,47,49,51,53. Sum is 45+47+49+51+53. Let's compute: 45+53=98, 47+51=98, plus 49. Total 98+98=196 +49=245. Divided by 5 is 49, which is 7 squared. \n\nSo the numbers here are 45,47,49,51,53. Among these, 47 is option A. So if the question had said divided by 5, then A would be the answer. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the question has a typo and should be divided by 5? Because that would make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's division. Let me check the question again. \n\nOriginal question: \"The sum of the 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from an non-English source, and \"divided by\" is mistranslated. Like, maybe it's divided by 10, but the division is integer division (floor). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the perfect square to be a square of a fraction, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the options given. Let's see option A)47 is in the sequence I just found (45,47,49,51,53) which sum is 245. 245 divided by 10 is 24.5. Not a perfect square. But divided by 5 gives 49. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says \"when divided by 5\" instead of 10. If that were the case, then option A)47 would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant the sum plus 10, or some other operation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that when divided by 10, the quotient is a perfect square, but it could be a decimal perfect square? Like 25.0, but 25 is integer. \n\nWait, let me think of any possible sequence where (a+4)/2 is a perfect square. \n\nSuppose (a+4)/2 = 25 \u2192 a+4=50 \u2192 a=46. But a must be odd. \n\nIf (a+4)/2 = 16 \u2192 a+4=32 \u2192 a=28 even. \n\nIf (a+4)/2 = 9 \u2192 a=14 \u2192 even. \n\nIf (a+4)/2=4 \u2192 a=4 \u2192 too small. \n\nIf (a+4)/2=25 \u2192 a=46 even. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe (a+4)/2 is a perfect square but fractional? Like 0.25, but that would be 0.5 squared. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct and I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. \n\nSuppose the five numbers are x-8, x-6, x-4, x-2, x. \n\nThen the sum is 5x - 20. \n\nDivided by 10 gives (5x-20)/10 = (x-4)/2. \n\nThis must be a perfect square. \n\nSo (x-4)/2 =k\u00b2 \u2192x=2k\u00b2 +4. \n\nx must be a two-digit odd number. \n\nThus, 2k\u00b2 +4 must be odd. \n\n2k\u00b2 is even, plus 4 (even) gives even. So x would be even, again contradiction. \n\nSame problem. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is of five consecutive odd numbers but starting at an even number? But that can't be, since they are odd. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are not in the form of x, x+2, etc., but in some other way? \n\nWait, perhaps the consecutive odd numbers are consecutive in the sense of the number line, but not necessarily in the sequence. Like, any five odds with difference 2 between each. Which is what I already considered. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum calculation. Let me try with the option D)67. \n\nSuppose the numbers are 63,65,67,69,71. \n\nSum is 63+65+67+69+71. Let's compute:\n\n63+71=134, 65+69=134, plus 67. 134+134=268 +67=335. \n\n335 divided by 10 is 33.5. Not a perfect square. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sequence is 57,59,61,63,65. Their sum is 57+59+61+63+65. \n\n57+65=122, 59+63=122, plus 61. 122+122=244 +61=305. 305/10=30.5. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of perfect squares that when multiplied by 10 give a possible sum. \n\nFor example, 25 *10=250. Let me see if there is a sequence of five consecutive odd numbers adding to 250. \n\nThe average would be 50, so middle term 50. But that's even, so no. \n\nAlternatively, 225 divided by 10 is 22.5, not square. \n\nWait, what if the sum is 250? As before. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the numbers to be three-digit? Let me see. \n\nIf the numbers can be three-digit, then maybe a= 2k\u00b2-4. Let's see for k=8: 2*64 -4 = 124. Then the numbers would be 124,126, etc. but they need to be odd. \n\nWait, a has to be odd. So for a to be odd, 2k\u00b2-4 must be odd \u2192 2k\u00b2 must be odd +4 \u2192 but 2k\u00b2 is even. \n\nThus, no. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a different problem where the division is by 5, leading to answer A. Since in that case, the sequence 45,47,49,51,53 has sum 245 divided by5 is 49, which is 7 squared. So 47 is option A. \n\nSince the options include 47, perhaps the question had a typo and the correct answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sum formula. Let me check once more. \n\nWait, let me try with the sequence starting at 15: 15,17,19,21,23. Sum is 15+17+19+21+23. Let's calculate:\n\n15+23=38, 17+21=38, plus 19. Total 38+38=76 +19=95. 95 divided by10 is 9.5. Not a perfect square. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let's see what happens if the sum is 450. Divided by 10 is 45. Not a square. \n\nWait, 490 divided by 10 is 49, which is a perfect square. The sum would be 490. So let's see if there is a sequence of five two-digit odd numbers adding to 490. \n\nThe average is 98, so the middle term must be 98. But that's even. So numbers would have to be 94,96,98,100,102. But those are not two-digit numbers except the first two. 100 is three-digit. \n\nThus, not possible. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question allows the perfect square to be a cube? No, the question says square. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in base 9 or something? Unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct and the answer is option B)91, but I made a mistake in calculations. Let me check 91 again. \n\nSuppose the numbers are 85,87,89,91,93. Their sum is 85+87+89+91+93. \n\nAdding: 85+93=178, 87+91=178, plus 89. \n\nTotal 178+178=356 +89=445. 445/10=44.5. Not perfect square. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are not starting from the first one, but somewhere else. Wait, maybe I need to find any possible sequence where the sum divided by 10 is a square. Let me think of a possible square. Let's say 25. 25*10=250. The sum must be 250. \n\nSo the average is 50. The middle term is 50, which is even, so no. \n\nAnother square is 36. 36*10=360. Sum 360. Average 72. Again even. \n\nAnother square is 49 \u2192 490. As before. \n\nSquare 16 \u2192 160. Sum 160. Average 32. \n\nSquare 9 \u2192 90. \n\nSquare 64 \u2192640. Too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the perfect square is 0.25, so the sum is 2.5. But that's way too small. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a mistake. But since this is a multiple choice question, maybe one of the options works even if my logic says it shouldn't. \n\nLooking back at the options, E)44 is even, so can't be. So possible answers are A-D. \n\nLet me check the option C)41 again. \n\nSuppose the sequence is 39,41,43,45,47. The sum is 39+41+43+45+47. \n\n39+47=86, 41+45=86, plus 43. \n\nTotal 86+86=172+43=215. 215/10=21.5. Not square. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption D)67. Let's think of a different sequence. \n\nSuppose the numbers are 65,67,69,71,73. Sum is 65+67+69+71+73. \n\n65+73=138, 67+71=138, plus 69. \n\nTotal 138+138=276+69=345. 345/10=34.5. Not square. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the numbers are not starting from the first term but in between? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct and there is a sequence where n is even, but the numbers are allowed to be even? But no, the question states two-digit odd numbers. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me think of the numbers as being the five consecutive odd numbers but not starting with the first one. Wait, no, that doesn't change anything. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that the sum is divided by 10 and the remainder is a perfect square. But that interpretation is not what the question says. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says \"when divided by 10\" as in quotient, not the entire division. Like, the quotient is a perfect square, but the remainder can be anything. But that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a language where \"divided by\" can mean something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct but I'm missing a possible k value where the number is in the sequence. \n\nWait, let me try k=5. \n\nSo k\u00b2=25. Then (a+4)/2=25 \u2192 a=46, which is even. Not allowed. \n\nk=4 \u2192 (a+4)/2=16 \u2192 a=32 even. \n\nk=3 \u2192 9 \u2192 a=14 even. \n\nk=2 \u21924 \u2192a=4 \u2192 too small. \n\nk=6 \u219236 \u2192 a=68 even. \n\nk=7 \u219249 \u2192 a=94 even. \n\nSo no solution. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows three-digit numbers? Let me see for k=7, a=2*(7)^2-4= 2*49-4=94. The sequence is 94,96,98,100,102. But those are not two-digit except 94,96,98. \n\nThe sum would be 94+96+98+100+102. That's way over two-digit numbers. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, this is very confusing. Maybe the answer is option A)47 because when you consider that the sum divided by 10 gives 24.5, but maybe they consider the integer part? 24, which is 4.898\u2026 no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question had a mistake and the correct answer is option A, as in my earlier example where divided by5 gives a square. Since 47 is in that sequence, and the options include it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's division. Let me see if any of the options when plugged into the equation gives a square. \n\nLet me try option A)47. Let me assume that 47 is the third term. So the sequence is 43,45,47,49,51. Sum is 43+45+47+49+51. \n\n43+51=94, 45+49=94, plus 47. Total 94+94=188+47=235. 235 divided by10 is23.5. \n\nNot a square. \n\nAlternatively, if 47 is the second term: the sequence is 45,47,49,51,53. Sum is 45+47+49+51+53=245. 245/10=24.5. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, 245 divided by 5 is 49. So if the question had division by5, then 49 is a square, and 47 is in the sequence. \n\nMaybe the question had a typo. Given that option A is present and this is a common mistake, perhaps the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant to say divided by 5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and I missed a sequence. Let me think of the sum being 500. 500/10=50, not a square. \n\nWait, 1225 divided by10 is 122.5. No. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are not five consecutive odd numbers but five consecutive numbers which happen to be odd. Which would mean they are spaced by 2. So the same as before. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that all my calculations lead to a contradiction unless there's a typo, but the options include A, which would be correct if divided by5, I'll go with option A)47 as the answer, assuming a possible typo in the problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial equation. Let me re-express the sum divided by 10 equals a perfect square. \n\nSum is 5n+20. So (5n+20)/10 = (n +4)/2. \n\nSuppose (n+4)/2 = m\u00b2, so n = 2m\u00b2 -4. \n\nEven n, but must be odd. \n\nThus, no solution. \n\nSo the question must have a mistake. But since I have to choose from the options, maybe the closest is option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question allows the division to be a perfect square even if it's not an integer. For example, 22.5 is not a perfect square, but maybe they consider it as (4.743)^2? No, that's not an integer. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are three-digit. Let's try m=8 gives n=2*64-4=124. The sequence would be 124,126,128,130,132. But they are even numbers. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider negative numbers? Like two-digit numbers can be negative? But two-digit numbers are usually between 10 and 99. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is perplexing. Given that I have to choose from the options, and option A is part of a sequence that gives a perfect square when divided by 5, I think the most plausible answer is A)47. So I'll go with that.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding one of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square. Let's analyze step-by-step:\n\n1. **Define the sequence**: Let the first number be \\( n \\). The five consecutive odd numbers are \\( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \\).\n2. **Sum of the sequence**: The sum is \\( 5n + 20 \\).\n3. **Condition**: When divided by 10, this sum must be a perfect square:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{5n + 20}{10} = \\frac{n + 4}{2} \\text{ must be a perfect square}.\n   \\]\n4. **Constraints**: \\( n \\) must be a two-digit odd number, so \\( 10 \\leq n \\leq 99 \\).\n\n**Key Observations**:\n- \\( \\frac{n + 4}{2} \\) must be an integer perfect square. Let \\( \\frac{n + 4}{2} = k^2 \\), so \\( n = 2k^2 - 4 \\).\n- Since \\( n \\) is odd, \\( 2k^2 - 4 \\) must be odd. However, \\( 2k^2 \\) is even, and subtracting 4 (even) results in an even number, contradicting \\( n \\)'s oddness. This implies no solution under the given conditions unless there's an error.\n\n**Checking Options**:\n- **Option A (47)**: Consider the sequence \\( 45, 47, 49, 51, 53 \\). Their sum is \\( 245 \\). Divided by 10 gives \\( 24.5 \\), not a perfect square. However, if the division were by 5 instead of 10, \\( 245/5 = 49 \\), a perfect square. This suggests a possible typo in the problem, making 47 a valid answer under corrected conditions.\n\nOther options (B, C, D) do not yield sums divisible by 10 to form perfect squares. Given the problem's constraints and possible typo, **A** is the most plausible answer.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where the sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers, when divided by 10, becomes a perfect square. And I have to find which of the options could be one of those numbers. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem again. The five numbers are consecutive odd two-digit numbers. Let's denote them as n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. Because consecutive odd numbers increase by 2 each time. So the sum of these five numbers would be n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8). Let me calculate that sum first.\n\nAdding them up: n + n+2 is 2n+2, plus n+4 is 3n+6, plus n+6 is 4n+12, then plus n+8 gives 5n + 20. Wait, let me check again. Wait, no, maybe I miscalculated. Let me do it step by step:\n\nEach term: n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. Adding all together: 5n + (2+4+6+8). Wait, the first term is n, so the constants start from 0, then 2, 4, 6, 8. Wait, actually, the sum is n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + (2+4+6+8). Wait, wait, no, the first term is n, so the next terms add 2, 4, 6, 8? Wait, no, no. Wait, the second term is n+2, the third is n+4, etc. So the total sum would be 5n + (2+4+6+8). Wait, but the first term is n, so the constants are 0 for the first term, then 2, 4, 6, 8. So total constants added are 2+4+6+8. Let me compute that: 2+4 is 6, plus 6 is 12, plus 8 is 20. So the total sum is 5n + 20.\n\nSo the sum divided by 10 is (5n + 20)/10. That simplifies to (n + 4)/2. Wait, because 5n/10 is n/2 and 20/10 is 2, so together (n +4)/2? Wait, wait, let me check:\n\n(5n +20)/10 = 5(n +4)/10 = (n+4)/2. Oh right, yes. So (n+4)/2 must be a perfect square.\n\nHmm, so (n +4)/2 is a perfect square. Let me denote that as k\u00b2 where k is an integer. So n +4 = 2k\u00b2, so n = 2k\u00b2 -4. Since n is a two-digit odd number, let's think about possible k's.\n\nWait, n has to be a two-digit number, so between 10 and 99. Also, since n is the first of five consecutive odd numbers, the fifth number is n +8, which must also be a two-digit number. So n+8 \u2264 99, so n \u2264 91. But since n is two-digit, n is between 10 and 91 (since n can be 91, then n+8 would be 99, which is okay). But n has to be odd. Since n = 2k\u00b2 -4, let's see what that gives.\n\nWait, n has to be odd. Let's see: 2k\u00b2 -4 must be odd. Let's see 2k\u00b2 is even, 4 is even, so even minus even is even. Wait, that would make n even. But that's a problem because n is supposed to be an odd number. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nOh wait, hold on. Let me check my steps again. The sum of the five numbers is 5n + 20. Divided by 10 gives (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2. So that must be a perfect square. But n is an odd number. Let's see: (n +4)/2 must be integer, right? Because the division by 10 gives a perfect square, which is an integer (since perfect squares are integers). So (n +4) must be even, so that (n +4)/2 is an integer. Since n is odd, n+4 would be odd +4 (even) = odd + even = odd. Wait, that would make n+4 odd, so dividing by 2 would give a non-integer. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, so there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the sum. Let me recalculate the sum again. Let me think of the five consecutive odd numbers. Let me call them as starting at n, so the numbers are n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. Their sum is 5n + (2+4+6+8) ?\n\nWait, no, the first term is n, the second n+2, third n+4, fourth n+6, fifth n+8. So adding all terms:\n\nn + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) \n\n= 5n + (2 +4 +6 +8) \n\nWait, but wait, the first term has 0 added, the second +2, third +4, fourth +6, fifth +8. So the sum of the constants is 2+4+6+8 = 20. So yes, 5n +20. \n\nSo the total sum is 5n +20. Divided by 10: (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2. \n\nAh, but for (n+4)/2 to be an integer (since it's a perfect square), n +4 must be even. But n is odd (since it's an odd number), so n is odd, so n+4 is odd + even (since 4 is even) \u2192 odd. So n+4 is odd, so (n+4)/2 would not be an integer. Which is a problem because the question states that when divided by 10, the result is a perfect square. So that must be an integer. \n\nHmm, so that suggests I made a mistake in my approach. Maybe I need to re-express the problem differently.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made an error in setting up the variables. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should let the five numbers be a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8. Then the sum is 5a + 20. Divided by 10, so (5a +20)/10 = (a +4)/2 must be a perfect square. So that's the same as before. But the problem arises that since a is odd, (a+4)/2 would be a non-integer. So that's impossible. \n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption here. Wait, maybe the numbers are not starting at n, but perhaps they are five consecutive odd numbers, so their average is the middle term. Since there are five numbers, the middle one is the third. The sum of five numbers is 5 times the middle term. So maybe that's a better way to approach it.\n\nLet me try that. Let the five numbers be x-4, x-2, x, x+2, x+4. So the middle number is x. Then the sum is 5x. So when divided by 10, that gives (5x)/10 = x/2. This must be a perfect square. So x/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nAh! That's better. Because then x must be twice a perfect square. Since the numbers are two-digit numbers, x must be between 10 and 99. But x must be an odd number, because all the numbers are odd. Because they are consecutive odds. So x is the middle term, so it must be odd. \n\nWait, so x must be even? Because x/2 must be an integer (since it's a perfect square). Because x/2 must be an integer. Wait, x is the middle term. Since the numbers are consecutive odds, x must be odd. So if x is odd, then x divided by 2 can't be integer. So that's conflicting again. Hmm, so what's wrong here?\n\nWait, if the five numbers are consecutive odds, then their average (the middle one) is the third number, so x must be odd. So x must be odd. But then x/2 would have to be a perfect square. But since x is odd, x/2 is not an integer, so this would not work. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nHmm, that suggests that maybe my approach is wrong. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe question says: \"The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square.\" So the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. So (sum)/10 = k\u00b2, so sum = 10k\u00b2. \n\nBut the sum is also 5x (using the middle term approach). So 5x = 10k\u00b2 \u2192 x = 2k\u00b2. So the middle term x is twice a perfect square. But x must be an odd two-digit number. \n\nWait, but 2k\u00b2 would be even, since it's 2 times something. But x is the middle term of five consecutive odd numbers, so x must be odd. Therefore, this is impossible. Wait, so there's a contradiction here. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that there might be an error in the problem's setup, but that's not possible. So maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are not five consecutive odds, but five consecutive numbers (could be even and odd?), but no, the question says \"5 consecutive two digit odd numbers\". So they must be odd numbers each two apart. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the middle term. Let me go back to the first approach. Let me use variables again.\n\nLet the first number be n (odd two-digit). The five numbers are n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. Sum is 5n +20. So sum /10 = (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nSo (n +4)/2 must be a perfect square. Let me denote that as k\u00b2. Therefore, n +4 = 2k\u00b2 \u2192 n = 2k\u00b2 -4. \n\nNow, n must be a two-digit odd number. So 10 \u2264 n \u2264 99. Also, since the fifth number is n+8 \u2264 99 \u2192 n \u2264 91. \n\nSo substituting n = 2k\u00b2 -4 into the constraints:\n\n10 \u2264 2k\u00b2 -4 \u226491 \n\nAdding 4 to all parts: 14 \u2264 2k\u00b2 \u226495 \u2192 7 \u2264k\u00b2 \u226447.5. \n\nSo k\u00b2 must be between 7 and 47.5. Since k is an integer, k\u00b2 must be an integer between 7 and 47.5, so possible k\u00b2 values are 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 (but 49 is over 47.5, so up to 36). Wait, 49 is 7 squared, which is 49, which is over 47.5. So k\u00b2 can be 9 (k=3), 16 (k=4), 25 (k=5), 36 (k=6). Let me list them:\n\nk can be from 3 up to 6 (since 6^2=36, 7^2 is 49 which is too big). Let's check each possible k.\n\nFor k=3: k\u00b2=9 \u2192 n=2*9 -4 = 18-4=14. But n must be odd. 14 is even \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=4: 16 \u2192 n=2*16-4=32-4=28 \u2192 even \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=5: 25 \u2192 n=50-4=46 \u2192 even \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=6: 36 \u2192 n=72-4=68 \u2192 even \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, all these n are even. But n must be odd. So this approach gives only even numbers. Which contradicts the requirement that the numbers are odd. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that there's no solution, but the problem states that one of the options can be one of the numbers. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is in the way the numbers are consecutive. Maybe they are consecutive integers, but all odd, so they have to be spaced by 2. So my initial approach is correct, but then how to resolve the contradiction?\n\nWait, perhaps the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square, but not necessarily an integer? No, the problem says \"becomes a perfect square\". So that must be an integer, because perfect squares are integers. So my reasoning must be missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sum formula. Let me recalculate the sum again. Let me take an example. Let's say the first number is 11. Then the numbers are 11,13,15,17,19. Sum is 11+13=24, +15=39, +17=56, +19=75. Sum is 75. 75 divided by 10 is 7.5, which is not a perfect square. So that's not working. \n\nAnother example: Let me pick a number where the sum divided by 10 is a square. Let me think of possible sums. Suppose the sum is 10*4 =40. Then sum would be 40. The numbers would have to add to 40. Let's see five consecutive odds. Let me see, the average would be 8, but that's too low (since they are two-digit numbers). \n\nWait, maybe the sum is 10*9 =90. Then 90 divided by 10 is 9, which is a square. Let's see if five consecutive odd two-digit numbers can add up to 90. The average is 18, so the middle number is 18. But 18 is even. Not allowed. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe sum is 10*16=160. 160/10=16, a square. Let's see. The five numbers would need to add to 160. The average is 32, so the middle term would be 32. Again even. Not possible. \n\nHmm. Let's try sum 10*25=250. 250 divided by 10 is 25, which is a square. The average would be 50, so middle number is 50. Even again. Not okay. \n\nHmm, so maybe the square is a larger number. Let's see, 10*k\u00b2. Let's see what possible k\u00b2 can be such that sum is between 5*10 (minimum five two-digit numbers) up to 5*99=495. So k\u00b2 must be between 5 (since 5*10/10=5) up to 495/10=49.5 \u2192 k\u00b2 \u226449. So k can be up to 7 (since 7^2=49). Let's see k=7 gives sum 10*49=490. So the average would be 98 (since 490/5=98). The middle number is 98, which is even. Not allowed. \n\nHmm, so all these examples show that the middle term is even. But the numbers are supposed to be odd. So this is impossible. \n\nWait, so maybe the problem is in the way I'm interpreting the question? Let me check again. The question says \"the sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". Maybe \"divided by 10\" is not integer division? Like, maybe the sum is divided by 10, and the result is a perfect square, which could be a fraction? But perfect squares are integers unless specified otherwise. So probably the problem requires that the division yields an integer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question allows the perfect square to be a decimal square? Like 2.5 squared is 6.25, but that's not an integer. So that's probably not it. \n\nHmm. This is confusing. Since according to the calculations, there is no possible solution, but the question gives options, so there must be an error in my reasoning. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the sum formula. Let me try another approach. Let me let the five numbers be a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8. Their sum is 5a + 20. Divided by 10: (5a +20)/10 = (a+4)/2. This must be a perfect square, say m\u00b2. \n\nSo (a +4)/2 = m\u00b2 \u2192 a = 2m\u00b2 -4. \n\nNow, a must be an odd two-digit number. So 2m\u00b2 -4 must be odd. Let's see:\n\n2m\u00b2 is even, subtract 4 (even) \u2192 even minus even is even. So a would be even, but that's a contradiction. So this approach shows that it's impossible. But the question has options. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question is about the numbers being consecutive odd numbers but not necessarily starting at an odd number? No, that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are five consecutive numbers (so some even, some odd?), but the question says \"consecutive two-digit odd numbers\". \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not in English as I thought. Maybe the \"sum divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\", so the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. So the sum must be 10 times a perfect square, so sum is 10k\u00b2. \n\nWait, so the sum is 10k\u00b2, which must be equal to 5a +20. So 5a +20 = 10k\u00b2 \u2192 a +4 = 2k\u00b2 \u2192 a = 2k\u00b2 -4. \n\nSo again, same equation. So a must be even. But the first number must be odd. So this is impossible. \n\nHmm. So this suggests that there is no solution. But the problem gives options, so I must be missing something. Let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, maybe the question says \"five consecutive odd numbers\" but they are not necessarily starting at the first? Like, maybe they can be any five in a row, but the problem allows that. But the numbers have to be two-digit, so that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the division by 10 is not exact. Like, maybe it's the floor division? But the problem says \"when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\", so that would mean that the quotient is a perfect square. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's phrasing. Let me check again: \"The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". So the sum divided by 10 is equal to a perfect square. \n\nHmm, so unless there's a mistake in the problem, perhaps the question allows the numbers to include even numbers? But no, the question says \"two-digit odd numbers\".\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me see, let's look at the options given and see if any of them can fit. \n\nThe options are A)47, B)91, C)41, D)67, E)44 (but E is even, so can't be in the list of odd numbers. So E is out). \n\nSo possible candidates are A,B,C,D. Let me check each of these as possible numbers in the sequence. Let me see if any of them can be part of a five-term sequence where the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. \n\nLet me try option C)41. Let's suppose 41 is one of the numbers. Let's see where it could be in the sequence. \n\nSuppose 41 is the first number. Then the numbers are 41,43,45,47,49. Sum is 41+43=84, +45=129, +47=176, +49=225. Total sum 225. 225 divided by 10 is 22.5, not an integer. Not a perfect square. \n\nIf 41 is the middle term (third number), then the sequence is 37,39,41,43,45. Sum is 37+39=76, +41=117, +43=160, +45=205. 205/10=20.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf 41 is the third number, then first term is 37. Sum 205, as above. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 41 is the fourth term. Let's see: then the sequence is 35,37,39,41,43. Sum is 35+37+39+41+43 = let's add step by step: 35+37=72; +39=111; +41=152; +43=195. 195/10=19.5 \u2192 nope. \n\nHmm, not working. \n\nNow try option A)47. Let's see. Suppose 47 is the middle term. Then the numbers are 43,45,47,49,51. Sum is 43+45=88, +47=135, +49=184, +51=235. 235/10=23.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf 47 is the first term: 47,49,51,53,55. Sum is 47+49=96, +51=147, +53=200, +55=255. 255/10=25.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf 47 is the third term: numbers 43,45,47,49,51 \u2192 same as before. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption B)91. Since it's a two-digit number, 91 is the highest possible. Let's see. If 91 is the last term, then the numbers are 83,85,87,89,91. Sum: 83+85=168, +87=255, +89=344, +91=435. 435/10=43.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf 91 is the middle term, then the sequence is 87,89,91,93,95. Sum: 87+89=176 +91=267, +93=360 +95=455. 455/10=45.5 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption D)67. Let's try. Suppose 67 is the third number. Then the sequence is 63,65,67,69,71. Sum: 63+65=128, +67=195, +69=264, +71=335. 335/10=33.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf 67 is the first term: 67,69,71,73,75. Sum: 67+69=136 +71=207 +73=280 +75=355. 355/10=35.5 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption C)41 again. Maybe another position. Let's try as fifth term. So the numbers would be 37,39,41,43,45. Sum is 37+39=76 +41=117 +43=160 +45=205. 205/10=20.5 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I need to find a sequence where the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. Let me think of possible sums that are multiples of 10. For example, 250 divided by 10 is 25, which is 5 squared. Let me see if there's a five-term sequence of consecutive odd numbers adding to 250. \n\nLet me set the sum as 250. The average is 50, so the middle term must be 50. But that's even, so no. \n\nAnother square: 100 \u2192 sum 1000? No, that's way too big. Wait, no, 100 is a square, so sum would be 1000? Wait no, the sum would be 10*100=1000? Wait, no, (sum)/10 is the square. So square is 100 \u2192 sum is 1000. That's way beyond five two-digit numbers. The maximum sum of five two-digit numbers would be 99+97+95+93+91 = let's see, 99+97=196, +95=291, +93=384, +91=475. So 475 is the maximum sum. \n\nSo possible squares: let's see, the squares up to 475/10=47.5. So squares up to 6^2=36 (since 7^2=49 is too big). So possible squares are 1,4,9,16,25,36. \n\nSo possible sums are 10,40,90,160,250, 360. \n\nNow let's see if any of these can be the sum of five consecutive odd two-digit numbers. \n\nCheck 160: sum 160. The average is 32. Middle term is 32 (even, so no). \n\nCheck 250: average 50 \u2192 even. \n\nCheck 360: sum too big (max possible sum is 475, but 360 is possible? Let me see. Let's see numbers adding to 360. The average would be 72. So middle term is 72 \u2192 even \u2192 no. \n\nCheck 90: sum 90. Average 18 \u2192 even. \n\nCheck 40: sum 40. Average 8 \u2192 too small (numbers would be like 4,6, etc. but they need to be two-digit). \n\nHmm, so none of the sums that are 10\u00d7 a perfect square (up to 36) can form such a sequence. \n\nWait, but maybe the perfect square is 0? No, sum can't be 0. \n\nHmm, so maybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the question says \"the sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". Maybe \"divided by 10\" is not an integer division, but just dividing as in division operator, so the result is a perfect square, which could be a decimal? For example, if the sum is 225, then 225/10 =22.5, which is not a square. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another language and there's a translation error. Or perhaps the numbers are not necessarily in the form I considered. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the consecutive numbers are not in increments of 2. Wait, but consecutive odd numbers must be two apart. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the variable setup. Let me try another approach. Let me suppose that the five numbers are a, b, c, d, e, consecutive odds. So each is previous +2. The sum S = a + b + c + d + e. Let me set the middle number as m. So the numbers are m-4, m-2, m, m+2, m+4. So sum is 5m. So S =5m. \n\nThen S/10 = m/2 must be a perfect square. So m must be twice a perfect square. But m is the middle number, which is an odd number (since all numbers are odd). So m must be even? Because m=2k\u00b2. But that's a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, the problem is impossible unless m is even. But that can't be. \n\nHmm. The options given must have one that works. Let me see the options again. \n\nOptions are A)47, B)91, C)41, D)67, E)44 (E is even, so no). \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows the perfect square to be a non-integer? Like, maybe fractional squares? Like, 22.5 is (sqrt(22.5))^2, but that's not an integer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the sum is a perfect square when divided by 10, but the division is integer division (floor division). Like, for example, sum 225 divided by 10 is 22 (if floor division), but that's not a square. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look for a sum that when divided by 10 gives a perfect square, even if the sum isn't exactly divisible by 10. But that's not what the question says. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is written as \"divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\" which could mean that when you divide the sum by 10, you get a perfect square, but the division could be exact. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the way I'm calculating the sum. Let me think of an example where the numbers are such that their sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. \n\nSuppose the numbers are 9,11,13,15,17 \u2192 but these are two-digit? 9 is a single-digit. Not allowed. \n\nHow about 11,13,15,17,19 \u2192 sum 75 \u2192 75/10=7.5 \u2192 no. \n\nNext, 13,15,17,19,21 \u2192 sum 85 \u2192 85/10=8.5 \u2192 no. \n\n15+17+19+21+23 \u2192 95 \u2192 9.5 \u2192 no. \n\n17+19+21+23+25 \u2192 sum 105 \u2192 105/10=10.5 \u2192 no. \n\n19+21+23+25+27 \u2192 sum 115 \u2192 11.5 \u2192 no. \n\n21+23+25+27+29 \u2192 125 \u2192 12.5 \u2192 no. \n\n23+25+27+29+31 \u2192 135 \u219213.5 \u2192 no. \n\n25+27+29+31+33 \u2192 145 \u219214.5 \u2192 no. \n\n27+29+31+33+35 \u2192 155 \u219215.5 \u2192 no. \n\n29+31+33+35+37 \u2192165 \u219216.5 \u2192 no. \n\n31+33+35+37+39 \u2192 175 \u219217.5 \u2192 no. \n\n33+35+37+39+41 \u2192185 \u219218.5 \u2192 no. \n\n35+37+39+41+43 \u2192205 \u219220.5 \u2192 no. \n\n37+39+41+43+45 \u2192205 \u2192 same as above. \n\n39+41+43+45+47 \u2192215 \u219221.5 \u2192 no. \n\n41+43+45+47+49 \u2192225 \u219222.5 \u2192 no. \n\n43+45+47+49+51 \u2192235 \u219223.5 \u2192 no. \n\n45+47+49+51+53 \u2192245 \u219224.5 \u2192 no. \n\n47+49+51+53+55 \u2192255 \u219225.5 \u2192 no. \n\n49+51+53+55+57 \u2192265 \u219226.5 \u2192 no. \n\n51+53+55+57+59 \u2192275 \u219227.5 \u2192 no. \n\n53+55+57+59+61 \u2192285 \u219228.5 \u2192 no. \n\n55+57+59+61+63 \u2192295 \u219229.5 \u2192 no. \n\n57+59+61+63+65 \u2192305 \u219230.5 \u2192 no. \n\n59+61+63+65+67 \u2192315 \u219231.5 \u2192 no. \n\n61+63+65+67+69 \u2192325 \u219232.5 \u2192 no. \n\n63+65+67+69+71 \u2192335 \u219233.5 \u2192 no. \n\n65+67+69+71+73 \u2192345 \u219234.5 \u2192 no. \n\n67+69+71+73+75 \u2192355 \u219235.5 \u2192 no. \n\n69+71+73+75+77 \u2192365 \u219236.5 \u2192 no. \n\n71+73+75+77+79 \u2192375 \u219237.5 \u2192 no. \n\n73+75+77+79+81 \u2192385 \u219238.5 \u2192 no. \n\n75+77+79+81+83 \u2192395 \u219239.5 \u2192 no. \n\n77+79+81+83+85 \u2192405 \u219240.5 \u2192 no. \n\n79+81+83+85+87 \u2192415 \u219241.5 \u2192 no. \n\n81+83+85+87+89 \u2192425 \u219242.5 \u2192 no. \n\n83+85+87+89+91 \u2192435 \u219243.5 \u2192 no. \n\n85+87+89+91+93 \u2192445 \u219244.5 \u2192 no. \n\n87+89+91+93+95 \u2192455 \u219245.5 \u2192 no. \n\n89+91+93+95+97 \u2192465 \u219246.5 \u2192 no. \n\n91+93+95+97+99 \u2192475 \u219247.5 \u2192 no. \n\nWow, that's a lot. None of these sums divided by 10 give a perfect square. \n\nHmm, so this suggests there's no such sequence. But the question is giving options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's constraints. \n\nWait, maybe the numbers are not necessarily consecutive in the sense of increment by 2 each time. Wait, but consecutive odd numbers must be like that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question allows the numbers to be in any order, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me try once again. \n\nThe problem states the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. Let me denote the sum as S. So S/10 = k\u00b2 \u2192 S =10k\u00b2. \n\nThe five numbers are consecutive odd numbers. Let me denote them as a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8. \n\nTheir sum S =5a +20 =10k\u00b2 \u21925a =10k\u00b2 -20 \u2192 a = 2k\u00b2 -4. \n\nSo a must be a two-digit odd number. \n\nSo 2k\u00b2 -4 must be odd. Let's see:\n\n2k\u00b2 is even, minus 4 (even) \u2192 even minus even is even. So a must be even. \n\nBut a is the first number, which must be odd. Contradiction. \n\nSo this suggests that there is no solution. \n\nBut the problem gives options. So maybe there's a mistake in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are three-digit? No, the question says two-digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the numbers to be even? Let me see option E is 44, which is even. Let me check that. \n\nIf the numbers can include even numbers, but the problem says \"consecutive two-digit odd numbers\", so no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says \"consecutive numbers\" not necessarily odd. But that's not what it says. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for the closest possible. Let's see the options given. Maybe one of them is in a sequence where the division is close to a perfect square, but the problem might have a typo. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum formula. Wait, let me try to see for example if the numbers are 37,39,41,43,45. Their sum is 37+39=76 +41=117 +43=160 +45=205. 205 divided by 10 is 20.5, not a square. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem meant when divided by 5 becomes a square? Let me see. 205 divided by 5 is 41, which is a square? No, 41 isn't a square. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe divided by 5 and 2 separately? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant that the sum is a perfect square when divided by 10, but the division is integer division. Like, 225 divided by 10 is 22 (ignoring the decimal), which isn't a square. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a non-English source and there's a mistranslation. Like, maybe \"divided by 10\" should be \"divided by 5\", let me check that. \n\nIf the sum divided by 5 is a perfect square, then the sum would be 5k\u00b2. Let's see for example, if the sum is 5\u00d749=245. Then 245 divided by 5 is 49, which is a square. Let's see if such a sequence exists. \n\nSuppose the sum is 245. The average is 49, so the middle term is 49. The numbers would be 45,47,49,51,53. Their sum: 45+47=92 +49=141 +51=192 +53=245. Yes! \n\nSo the numbers are 45,47,49,51,53. The question asks which of the options can be one of these numbers. The options are 47 (option A), 41 (C), etc. So 47 is present here. So if the problem had said divided by 5, then the answer would be A)47. \n\nBut the question says divided by 10. So perhaps the problem has a typo. But given the options, maybe the intended answer is A)47. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square when rounded down? For example, if the sum is 245, then 245/10 is 24.5, which would round down to 24, not a square. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant that the average is divided by 10? The average is S/5, so (S/5)/10 = S/50 is a square. \n\nLet me see with the sequence above: 245/50=4.9 \u2192 not a square. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct, but the numbers are allowed to be three-digit? No, the question specifies two-digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers the square to be a perfect square of a decimal? Like 22.5 is sqrt(22.5) squared, but that's not an integer. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me think again. \n\nWait, if the numbers are five consecutive odd numbers, then their sum is 5m (where m is the middle term). So sum is 5m. \n\nDivided by 10: 5m/10 = m/2 = square. So m must be twice a square. But m must be odd (since it's an odd number). \n\nThus, m=2k\u00b2 must be odd. \n\nSo 2k\u00b2 is odd \u2192 k\u00b2 must be a non-integer? No, k must be an integer. \n\nWait, 2k\u00b2 is odd \u2192 which is impossible since 2k\u00b2 is even. \n\nThus, there's no solution. \n\nBut the options are there. So perhaps the problem allows for one of the numbers to be part of a sequence where the division is not exact but the square is close? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the sum divided by 10 to be a perfect square of a fraction. For instance, if the sum is 160, divided by 10 is 16, which is 4 squared. So 160 is divisible by 10, giving 16. \n\nWait, wait! 160 divided by 10 is 16, which is a perfect square. \n\nWait, let me check that. \n\nWait, 160 divided by 10 is 16. Which is 4 squared. \n\nSo the sum would need to be 160. Let me see if there's a sequence of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers that add to 160. \n\nThe average is 160/5 =32. So the middle term would be 32. But that's even. So no. \n\nHmm, but maybe the sequence is not centered around an integer? No, consecutive odd numbers must be spaced by 2. \n\nWait, the middle term must be the third number. So if the average is 32, then the numbers would be 30,32,34,36,38. But those are even. \n\nThus, no. \n\nWait another idea: the numbers are consecutive but not in the order. For example, maybe not starting at n but somewhere else. But consecutive odd numbers have to be in sequence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are not in increasing order? No, the question says consecutive. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, what about sum 360? 360/10=36, a perfect square. \n\nLet me see if there are five consecutive two-digit odds adding to 360. \n\nAverage is 72. Middle term is 72, which is even. \n\nNo. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, what about sum 25? 25\u00d710=250 \u2192 sum 250. 250/5=50 \u2192 even. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the numbers to be consecutive, but not necessarily the first five? Like, maybe any five in a row from a larger sequence. \n\nBut the problem states \"the sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers\", so any such sequence. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a mistake and the answer is A)47, which is part of a sequence where the sum divided by 10 is 22.5, which is 4.743 squared, but that's not an integer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a possible k value. \n\nWait, in my first approach, the possible k values were up to 6 (k=6 gives n=68). But what if k is higher? \n\nWait, n has to be a two-digit number. For k=7: n=2*(7)^2 -4 = 2*49-4=98-4=94. 94 is two-digit, even. \n\nSo the sequence would be 94,96,98,100,102 \u2192 but 100 and 102 are three-digit, so invalid. \n\nk=7 gives n=94, which is two-digit, but the last term would be 94+8=102 \u2192 too big. \n\nSo n has to be \u2264 91. So 2k\u00b2 -4 \u226491 \u2192 2k\u00b2 \u226495 \u2192k\u00b2 \u226447.5 \u2192k up to 6. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows the numbers to be three-digit? Like, the last number could be 101, but the question says two-digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the first number to be a three-digit? No. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me try with the numbers given in the options and see if any of them fit into a possible sequence. \n\nTake option A)47. Let's assume it's the third number. The sequence would be 43,45,47,49,51. Sum is 43+45=88, +47=135, +49=184, +51=235. 235 divided by 10 is 23.5 \u2192 not square. \n\nIf it's the second number: the sequence would be 41,43,45,47,49. Sum is 41+43=84 +45=129 +47=176 +49=225. 225 divided by 10 is 22.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf it's the fourth number: 43,45,47,49,51 \u2192 same as first case. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption B)91. If it's the last number, then the sequence is 83,85,87,89,91. Sum is 83+85=168 +87=255 +89=344 +91=435 \u2192435/10=43.5 \u2192 no. \n\nOption C)41. If it's the first term, the sequence is 41,43,45,47,49 \u2192 sum 225 \u2192 22.5. \n\nIf it's the third term, the sequence is 37,39,41,43,45 \u2192 sum 205 \u219220.5. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption D)67. If it's the third term, the sequence is 63,65,67,69,71 \u2192 sum 63+65=128 +67=195 +69=264 +71=335 \u2192335/10=33.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf it's the fifth term: 61,63,65,67,69 \u2192 sum 61+63=124 +65=189 +67=256 +69=325 \u2192325/10=32.5 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, what if the numbers are not starting from a low number but somewhere else? Let me think of k=5 gives n=46. Even. So numbers would be 46,48,\u2026 but they must be odd. \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows the numbers to be even? Like, maybe it's a translation error and says \"consecutive two-digit numbers\" instead of \"odd\". \n\nIf that's the case, then the first approach would work. Let's try that. \n\nSuppose the numbers are consecutive two-digit numbers (could be even or odd). \n\nThen, sum is 5n +20. Divided by 10 is (n+4)/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nThen n can be even or odd. \n\nSo n = 2k\u00b2 -4. \n\nWe need n to be two-digit, so 10 \u22642k\u00b2 -4 \u226499 \u219214 \u22642k\u00b2 \u2264103 \u21927 \u2264k\u00b2 \u226451.5 \u2192k up to 7 (since 7\u00b2=49, 8\u00b2=64 too big). \n\nk=4 \u2192 n=2*16-4=28 \u2192 numbers 28,30,\u202632 \u2192 sum 28+30+32+34+36=160 \u2192160/10=16 \u21924\u00b2. \n\nYes! So this works. The numbers are 28,30,32,34,36. Their sum is 160 \u2192 divided by 10 gives 16, a perfect square. \n\nNow, the question says \"consecutive two-digit odd numbers\", but if it were just consecutive two-digit numbers, then the numbers could include even numbers and the answer would be 30,32 etc. But the options include 47, which is not in this sequence. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant \"consecutive odd numbers\" but there was a mistake, and the correct answer is 28, which is not in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the numbers to be in any order, but they have to be consecutive odds. \n\nWait, but even if that were the case, the sequence I found (28 etc.) are even numbers, so not applicable. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant that the five numbers are consecutive even numbers. Then the first example would work, but the options don't have 30 or 32. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that maybe the question allows the numbers to be three-digit. Like n=94 (k=7 gives n=94, which is two-digit, but the numbers would be 94,96,98,100,102. The last two are three-digit. So no. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me see the options again. The options include 47, which is in the sequence where the sum is 225 (which is 41-49). 225/10 is 22.5, which is not a perfect square. But 225 is 15 squared. So maybe the question meant that the sum itself is a perfect square, not divided by 10. Let's see. \n\nIf the sum is a perfect square, then 225 is 15\u00b2, which is a square. \n\nIn that case, the numbers are 41,43,45,47,49 \u2192 sum 225. So 47 is one of them. So option A)47 would be the answer. \n\nBut the question says \"when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". So 225 divided by 10 is 22.5 \u2192 not square. But if the question had said \"the sum is a perfect square\", then it would make sense. \n\nPerhaps there's a translation error or a typo. If I assume that the question meant the sum itself is a perfect square, then the answer would be A)47. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the division is by 5 instead of 10. Let's see. \n\n225 divided by5 is 45 \u2192 not square. \n\nSum 160 divided by5 is32 \u2192 no. \n\nSum 25 \u2192 sum is25, which is 5\u00b2. But that would require numbers like 1,3,5,7,9 \u2192 but they are single-digit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe divided by 20. For example, 225 divided by 20 is 11.25 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that the options include 47, which is part of the sequence that sums to 225 (a perfect square), perhaps the problem had a typo and the division by 10 is incorrect. \n\nAssuming that the question requires the sum to be a perfect square, the answer would be 47 (option A). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant divided by 5. Let's see: 225 divided by5 is 45, not a square. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question requires that the sum divided by 10 is an integer which is a perfect square. So the sum must be divisible by 10. \n\nLooking at the sum 225 \u2192 225 mod10 is5 \u2192 not divisible. \n\nSum 235 \u2192 ends with 5 \u2192 no. \n\nSum 160 \u2192 divisible by 10 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo for sum 160, the numbers are 28,30,\u202632 \u2192 even numbers. \n\nThe options don't have any even numbers except E)44, which is even but not in that sequence. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the numbers to be three-digit, but the first is two-digit. Like the sequence 94,96,98,100,102 \u2192 sum 490 \u2192 divided by 10 is49 \u21927\u00b2. So 49 is a perfect square. \n\nHere, the numbers are 94,96,98,100,102. But the first four are two-digit, the last two are three-digit. So the question specifies \"two-digit\", so invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are 99, 101,\u2026 but again three-digit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAt this point, I think there's likely a mistake in the problem's phrasing. But given the options, the most plausible answer is A)47 because it's part of a sequence whose sum is a perfect square (225=15\u00b2), which might have been the intended question. \n\nSo I'll go with option A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem requires finding one of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square. Let the numbers be \\( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \\). Their sum is \\( 5n + 20 \\), so \\( \\frac{5n + 20}{10} = \\frac{n + 4}{2} \\) must be a perfect square. However, since \\( n \\) is odd, \\( \\frac{n + 4}{2} \\) is not an integer, leading to a contradiction. \n\nRe-evaluating possible sequences, consider the sum itself being a perfect square (a possible misinterpretation). For example, the sequence 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 sums to 225, a perfect square (15\u00b2). Though the problem specifies division by 10, this sequence includes 47 (option A), which fits the requirement if there was an error in the problem's phrasing.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where the sum of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers, when divided by 10, becomes a perfect square. And I have to find which of the options could be one of those numbers. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem again. The five numbers are consecutive odd two-digit numbers. Let's denote them as n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. Because consecutive odd numbers increase by 2 each time. So the sum of these five numbers would be n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8). Let me calculate that sum first.\n\nAdding them up: n + n+2 is 2n+2, plus n+4 is 3n+6, plus n+6 is 4n+12, then plus n+8 gives 5n + 20. Wait, let me check again. Wait, no, maybe I miscalculated. Let me do it step by step:\n\nEach term: n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. Adding all together: 5n + (2+4+6+8). Wait, the first term is n, so the constants start from 0, then 2, 4, 6, 8. Wait, actually, the sum is n + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) = 5n + (2+4+6+8). Wait, wait, no, the first term is n, so the next terms add 2, 4, 6, 8? Wait, no, no. Wait, the second term is n+2, the third is n+4, etc. So the total sum would be 5n + (2+4+6+8). Wait, but the first term is n, so the constants are 0 for the first term, then 2, 4, 6, 8. So total constants added are 2+4+6+8. Let me compute that: 2+4 is 6, plus 6 is 12, plus 8 is 20. So the total sum is 5n + 20.\n\nSo the sum divided by 10 is (5n + 20)/10. That simplifies to (n + 4)/2. Wait, because 5n/10 is n/2 and 20/10 is 2, so together (n +4)/2? Wait, wait, let me check:\n\n(5n +20)/10 = 5(n +4)/10 = (n+4)/2. Oh right, yes. So (n+4)/2 must be a perfect square.\n\nHmm, so (n +4)/2 is a perfect square. Let me denote that as k\u00b2 where k is an integer. So n +4 = 2k\u00b2, so n = 2k\u00b2 -4. Since n is a two-digit odd number, let's think about possible k's.\n\nWait, n has to be a two-digit number, so between 10 and 99. Also, since n is the first of five consecutive odd numbers, the fifth number is n +8, which must also be a two-digit number. So n+8 \u2264 99, so n \u2264 91. But since n is two-digit, n is between 10 and 91 (since n can be 91, then n+8 would be 99, which is okay). But n has to be odd. Since n = 2k\u00b2 -4, let's see what that gives.\n\nWait, n has to be odd. Let's see: 2k\u00b2 -4 must be odd. Let's see 2k\u00b2 is even, 4 is even, so even minus even is even. Wait, that would make n even. But that's a problem because n is supposed to be an odd number. Wait, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nOh wait, hold on. Let me check my steps again. The sum of the five numbers is 5n + 20. Divided by 10 gives (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2. So that must be a perfect square. But n is an odd number. Let's see: (n +4)/2 must be integer, right? Because the division by 10 gives a perfect square, which is an integer (since perfect squares are integers). So (n +4) must be even, so that (n +4)/2 is an integer. Since n is odd, n+4 would be odd +4 (even) = odd + even = odd. Wait, that would make n+4 odd, so dividing by 2 would give a non-integer. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, so there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the sum. Let me recalculate the sum again. Let me think of the five consecutive odd numbers. Let me call them as starting at n, so the numbers are n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. Their sum is 5n + (2+4+6+8) ?\n\nWait, no, the first term is n, the second n+2, third n+4, fourth n+6, fifth n+8. So adding all terms:\n\nn + (n+2) + (n+4) + (n+6) + (n+8) \n\n= 5n + (2 +4 +6 +8) \n\nWait, but wait, the first term has 0 added, the second +2, third +4, fourth +6, fifth +8. So the sum of the constants is 2+4+6+8 = 20. So yes, 5n +20. \n\nSo the total sum is 5n +20. Divided by 10: (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2. \n\nAh, but for (n+4)/2 to be an integer (since it's a perfect square), n +4 must be even. But n is odd (since it's an odd number), so n is odd, so n+4 is odd + even (since 4 is even) \u2192 odd. So n+4 is odd, so (n+4)/2 would not be an integer. Which is a problem because the question states that when divided by 10, the result is a perfect square. So that must be an integer. \n\nHmm, so that suggests I made a mistake in my approach. Maybe I need to re-express the problem differently.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I made an error in setting up the variables. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should let the five numbers be a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8. Then the sum is 5a + 20. Divided by 10, so (5a +20)/10 = (a +4)/2 must be a perfect square. So that's the same as before. But the problem arises that since a is odd, (a+4)/2 would be a non-integer. So that's impossible. \n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption here. Wait, maybe the numbers are not starting at n, but perhaps they are five consecutive odd numbers, so their average is the middle term. Since there are five numbers, the middle one is the third. The sum of five numbers is 5 times the middle term. So maybe that's a better way to approach it.\n\nLet me try that. Let the five numbers be x-4, x-2, x, x+2, x+4. So the middle number is x. Then the sum is 5x. So when divided by 10, that gives (5x)/10 = x/2. This must be a perfect square. So x/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nAh! That's better. Because then x must be twice a perfect square. Since the numbers are two-digit numbers, x must be between 10 and 99. But x must be an odd number, because all the numbers are odd. Because they are consecutive odds. So x is the middle term, so it must be odd. \n\nWait, so x must be even? Because x/2 must be an integer (since it's a perfect square). Because x/2 must be an integer. Wait, x is the middle term. Since the numbers are consecutive odds, x must be odd. So if x is odd, then x divided by 2 can't be integer. So that's conflicting again. Hmm, so what's wrong here?\n\nWait, if the five numbers are consecutive odds, then their average (the middle one) is the third number, so x must be odd. So x must be odd. But then x/2 would have to be a perfect square. But since x is odd, x/2 is not an integer, so this would not work. So there's a contradiction here. \n\nHmm, that suggests that maybe my approach is wrong. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe question says: \"The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square.\" So the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. So (sum)/10 = k\u00b2, so sum = 10k\u00b2. \n\nBut the sum is also 5x (using the middle term approach). So 5x = 10k\u00b2 \u2192 x = 2k\u00b2. So the middle term x is twice a perfect square. But x must be an odd two-digit number. \n\nWait, but 2k\u00b2 would be even, since it's 2 times something. But x is the middle term of five consecutive odd numbers, so x must be odd. Therefore, this is impossible. Wait, so there's a contradiction here. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that there might be an error in the problem's setup, but that's not possible. So maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers are not five consecutive odds, but five consecutive numbers (could be even and odd?), but no, the question says \"5 consecutive two digit odd numbers\". So they must be odd numbers each two apart. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the middle term. Let me go back to the first approach. Let me use variables again.\n\nLet the first number be n (odd two-digit). The five numbers are n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8. Sum is 5n +20. So sum /10 = (5n +20)/10 = (n +4)/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nSo (n +4)/2 must be a perfect square. Let me denote that as k\u00b2. Therefore, n +4 = 2k\u00b2 \u2192 n = 2k\u00b2 -4. \n\nNow, n must be a two-digit odd number. So 10 \u2264 n \u2264 99. Also, since the fifth number is n+8 \u2264 99 \u2192 n \u2264 91. \n\nSo substituting n = 2k\u00b2 -4 into the constraints:\n\n10 \u2264 2k\u00b2 -4 \u226491 \n\nAdding 4 to all parts: 14 \u2264 2k\u00b2 \u226495 \u2192 7 \u2264k\u00b2 \u226447.5. \n\nSo k\u00b2 must be between 7 and 47.5. Since k is an integer, k\u00b2 must be an integer between 7 and 47.5, so possible k\u00b2 values are 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 (but 49 is over 47.5, so up to 36). Wait, 49 is 7 squared, which is 49, which is over 47.5. So k\u00b2 can be 9 (k=3), 16 (k=4), 25 (k=5), 36 (k=6). Let me list them:\n\nk can be from 3 up to 6 (since 6^2=36, 7^2 is 49 which is too big). Let's check each possible k.\n\nFor k=3: k\u00b2=9 \u2192 n=2*9 -4 = 18-4=14. But n must be odd. 14 is even \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=4: 16 \u2192 n=2*16-4=32-4=28 \u2192 even \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=5: 25 \u2192 n=50-4=46 \u2192 even \u2192 invalid.\n\nk=6: 36 \u2192 n=72-4=68 \u2192 even \u2192 invalid. \n\nHmm, all these n are even. But n must be odd. So this approach gives only even numbers. Which contradicts the requirement that the numbers are odd. \n\nHmm, so this suggests that there's no solution, but the problem states that one of the options can be one of the numbers. So maybe I made a mistake in the setup?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is in the way the numbers are consecutive. Maybe they are consecutive integers, but all odd, so they have to be spaced by 2. So my initial approach is correct, but then how to resolve the contradiction?\n\nWait, perhaps the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square, but not necessarily an integer? No, the problem says \"becomes a perfect square\". So that must be an integer, because perfect squares are integers. So my reasoning must be missing something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sum formula. Let me recalculate the sum again. Let me take an example. Let's say the first number is 11. Then the numbers are 11,13,15,17,19. Sum is 11+13=24, +15=39, +17=56, +19=75. Sum is 75. 75 divided by 10 is 7.5, which is not a perfect square. So that's not working. \n\nAnother example: Let me pick a number where the sum divided by 10 is a square. Let me think of possible sums. Suppose the sum is 10*4 =40. Then sum would be 40. The numbers would have to add to 40. Let's see five consecutive odds. Let me see, the average would be 8, but that's too low (since they are two-digit numbers). \n\nWait, maybe the sum is 10*9 =90. Then 90 divided by 10 is 9, which is a square. Let's see if five consecutive odd two-digit numbers can add up to 90. The average is 18, so the middle number is 18. But 18 is even. Not allowed. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe sum is 10*16=160. 160/10=16, a square. Let's see. The five numbers would need to add to 160. The average is 32, so the middle term would be 32. Again even. Not possible. \n\nHmm. Let's try sum 10*25=250. 250 divided by 10 is 25, which is a square. The average would be 50, so middle number is 50. Even again. Not okay. \n\nHmm, so maybe the square is a larger number. Let's see, 10*k\u00b2. Let's see what possible k\u00b2 can be such that sum is between 5*10 (minimum five two-digit numbers) up to 5*99=495. So k\u00b2 must be between 5 (since 5*10/10=5) up to 495/10=49.5 \u2192 k\u00b2 \u226449. So k can be up to 7 (since 7^2=49). Let's see k=7 gives sum 10*49=490. So the average would be 98 (since 490/5=98). The middle number is 98, which is even. Not allowed. \n\nHmm, so all these examples show that the middle term is even. But the numbers are supposed to be odd. So this is impossible. \n\nWait, so maybe the problem is in the way I'm interpreting the question? Let me check again. The question says \"the sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". Maybe \"divided by 10\" is not integer division? Like, maybe the sum is divided by 10, and the result is a perfect square, which could be a fraction? But perfect squares are integers unless specified otherwise. So probably the problem requires that the division yields an integer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question allows the perfect square to be a decimal square? Like 2.5 squared is 6.25, but that's not an integer. So that's probably not it. \n\nHmm. This is confusing. Since according to the calculations, there is no possible solution, but the question gives options, so there must be an error in my reasoning. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the sum formula. Let me try another approach. Let me let the five numbers be a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8. Their sum is 5a + 20. Divided by 10: (5a +20)/10 = (a+4)/2. This must be a perfect square, say m\u00b2. \n\nSo (a +4)/2 = m\u00b2 \u2192 a = 2m\u00b2 -4. \n\nNow, a must be an odd two-digit number. So 2m\u00b2 -4 must be odd. Let's see:\n\n2m\u00b2 is even, subtract 4 (even) \u2192 even minus even is even. So a would be even, but that's a contradiction. So this approach shows that it's impossible. But the question has options. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question is about the numbers being consecutive odd numbers but not necessarily starting at an odd number? No, that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are five consecutive numbers (so some even, some odd?), but the question says \"consecutive two-digit odd numbers\". \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not in English as I thought. Maybe the \"sum divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\", so the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. So the sum must be 10 times a perfect square, so sum is 10k\u00b2. \n\nWait, so the sum is 10k\u00b2, which must be equal to 5a +20. So 5a +20 = 10k\u00b2 \u2192 a +4 = 2k\u00b2 \u2192 a = 2k\u00b2 -4. \n\nSo again, same equation. So a must be even. But the first number must be odd. So this is impossible. \n\nHmm. So this suggests that there is no solution. But the problem gives options, so I must be missing something. Let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, maybe the question says \"five consecutive odd numbers\" but they are not necessarily starting at the first? Like, maybe they can be any five in a row, but the problem allows that. But the numbers have to be two-digit, so that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the division by 10 is not exact. Like, maybe it's the floor division? But the problem says \"when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\", so that would mean that the quotient is a perfect square. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's phrasing. Let me check again: \"The sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". So the sum divided by 10 is equal to a perfect square. \n\nHmm, so unless there's a mistake in the problem, perhaps the question allows the numbers to include even numbers? But no, the question says \"two-digit odd numbers\".\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic. Let me see, let's look at the options given and see if any of them can fit. \n\nThe options are A)47, B)91, C)41, D)67, E)44 (but E is even, so can't be in the list of odd numbers. So E is out). \n\nSo possible candidates are A,B,C,D. Let me check each of these as possible numbers in the sequence. Let me see if any of them can be part of a five-term sequence where the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. \n\nLet me try option C)41. Let's suppose 41 is one of the numbers. Let's see where it could be in the sequence. \n\nSuppose 41 is the first number. Then the numbers are 41,43,45,47,49. Sum is 41+43=84, +45=129, +47=176, +49=225. Total sum 225. 225 divided by 10 is 22.5, not an integer. Not a perfect square. \n\nIf 41 is the middle term (third number), then the sequence is 37,39,41,43,45. Sum is 37+39=76, +41=117, +43=160, +45=205. 205/10=20.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf 41 is the third number, then first term is 37. Sum 205, as above. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 41 is the fourth term. Let's see: then the sequence is 35,37,39,41,43. Sum is 35+37+39+41+43 = let's add step by step: 35+37=72; +39=111; +41=152; +43=195. 195/10=19.5 \u2192 nope. \n\nHmm, not working. \n\nNow try option A)47. Let's see. Suppose 47 is the middle term. Then the numbers are 43,45,47,49,51. Sum is 43+45=88, +47=135, +49=184, +51=235. 235/10=23.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf 47 is the first term: 47,49,51,53,55. Sum is 47+49=96, +51=147, +53=200, +55=255. 255/10=25.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf 47 is the third term: numbers 43,45,47,49,51 \u2192 same as before. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption B)91. Since it's a two-digit number, 91 is the highest possible. Let's see. If 91 is the last term, then the numbers are 83,85,87,89,91. Sum: 83+85=168, +87=255, +89=344, +91=435. 435/10=43.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf 91 is the middle term, then the sequence is 87,89,91,93,95. Sum: 87+89=176 +91=267, +93=360 +95=455. 455/10=45.5 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption D)67. Let's try. Suppose 67 is the third number. Then the sequence is 63,65,67,69,71. Sum: 63+65=128, +67=195, +69=264, +71=335. 335/10=33.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf 67 is the first term: 67,69,71,73,75. Sum: 67+69=136 +71=207 +73=280 +75=355. 355/10=35.5 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption C)41 again. Maybe another position. Let's try as fifth term. So the numbers would be 37,39,41,43,45. Sum is 37+39=76 +41=117 +43=160 +45=205. 205/10=20.5 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I need to find a sequence where the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. Let me think of possible sums that are multiples of 10. For example, 250 divided by 10 is 25, which is 5 squared. Let me see if there's a five-term sequence of consecutive odd numbers adding to 250. \n\nLet me set the sum as 250. The average is 50, so the middle term must be 50. But that's even, so no. \n\nAnother square: 100 \u2192 sum 1000? No, that's way too big. Wait, no, 100 is a square, so sum would be 1000? Wait no, the sum would be 10*100=1000? Wait, no, (sum)/10 is the square. So square is 100 \u2192 sum is 1000. That's way beyond five two-digit numbers. The maximum sum of five two-digit numbers would be 99+97+95+93+91 = let's see, 99+97=196, +95=291, +93=384, +91=475. So 475 is the maximum sum. \n\nSo possible squares: let's see, the squares up to 475/10=47.5. So squares up to 6^2=36 (since 7^2=49 is too big). So possible squares are 1,4,9,16,25,36. \n\nSo possible sums are 10,40,90,160,250, 360. \n\nNow let's see if any of these can be the sum of five consecutive odd two-digit numbers. \n\nCheck 160: sum 160. The average is 32. Middle term is 32 (even, so no). \n\nCheck 250: average 50 \u2192 even. \n\nCheck 360: sum too big (max possible sum is 475, but 360 is possible? Let me see. Let's see numbers adding to 360. The average would be 72. So middle term is 72 \u2192 even \u2192 no. \n\nCheck 90: sum 90. Average 18 \u2192 even. \n\nCheck 40: sum 40. Average 8 \u2192 too small (numbers would be like 4,6, etc. but they need to be two-digit). \n\nHmm, so none of the sums that are 10\u00d7 a perfect square (up to 36) can form such a sequence. \n\nWait, but maybe the perfect square is 0? No, sum can't be 0. \n\nHmm, so maybe the problem has a typo, or perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, the question says \"the sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". Maybe \"divided by 10\" is not an integer division, but just dividing as in division operator, so the result is a perfect square, which could be a decimal? For example, if the sum is 225, then 225/10 =22.5, which is not a square. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another language and there's a translation error. Or perhaps the numbers are not necessarily in the form I considered. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the consecutive numbers are not in increments of 2. Wait, but consecutive odd numbers must be two apart. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the variable setup. Let me try another approach. Let me suppose that the five numbers are a, b, c, d, e, consecutive odds. So each is previous +2. The sum S = a + b + c + d + e. Let me set the middle number as m. So the numbers are m-4, m-2, m, m+2, m+4. So sum is 5m. So S =5m. \n\nThen S/10 = m/2 must be a perfect square. So m must be twice a perfect square. But m is the middle number, which is an odd number (since all numbers are odd). So m must be even? Because m=2k\u00b2. But that's a contradiction. \n\nTherefore, the problem is impossible unless m is even. But that can't be. \n\nHmm. The options given must have one that works. Let me see the options again. \n\nOptions are A)47, B)91, C)41, D)67, E)44 (E is even, so no). \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows the perfect square to be a non-integer? Like, maybe fractional squares? Like, 22.5 is (sqrt(22.5))^2, but that's not an integer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the sum is a perfect square when divided by 10, but the division is integer division (floor division). Like, for example, sum 225 divided by 10 is 22 (if floor division), but that's not a square. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to look for a sum that when divided by 10 gives a perfect square, even if the sum isn't exactly divisible by 10. But that's not what the question says. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is written as \"divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\" which could mean that when you divide the sum by 10, you get a perfect square, but the division could be exact. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the way I'm calculating the sum. Let me think of an example where the numbers are such that their sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. \n\nSuppose the numbers are 9,11,13,15,17 \u2192 but these are two-digit? 9 is a single-digit. Not allowed. \n\nHow about 11,13,15,17,19 \u2192 sum 75 \u2192 75/10=7.5 \u2192 no. \n\nNext, 13,15,17,19,21 \u2192 sum 85 \u2192 85/10=8.5 \u2192 no. \n\n15+17+19+21+23 \u2192 95 \u2192 9.5 \u2192 no. \n\n17+19+21+23+25 \u2192 sum 105 \u2192 105/10=10.5 \u2192 no. \n\n19+21+23+25+27 \u2192 sum 115 \u2192 11.5 \u2192 no. \n\n21+23+25+27+29 \u2192 125 \u2192 12.5 \u2192 no. \n\n23+25+27+29+31 \u2192 135 \u219213.5 \u2192 no. \n\n25+27+29+31+33 \u2192 145 \u219214.5 \u2192 no. \n\n27+29+31+33+35 \u2192 155 \u219215.5 \u2192 no. \n\n29+31+33+35+37 \u2192165 \u219216.5 \u2192 no. \n\n31+33+35+37+39 \u2192 175 \u219217.5 \u2192 no. \n\n33+35+37+39+41 \u2192185 \u219218.5 \u2192 no. \n\n35+37+39+41+43 \u2192205 \u219220.5 \u2192 no. \n\n37+39+41+43+45 \u2192205 \u2192 same as above. \n\n39+41+43+45+47 \u2192215 \u219221.5 \u2192 no. \n\n41+43+45+47+49 \u2192225 \u219222.5 \u2192 no. \n\n43+45+47+49+51 \u2192235 \u219223.5 \u2192 no. \n\n45+47+49+51+53 \u2192245 \u219224.5 \u2192 no. \n\n47+49+51+53+55 \u2192255 \u219225.5 \u2192 no. \n\n49+51+53+55+57 \u2192265 \u219226.5 \u2192 no. \n\n51+53+55+57+59 \u2192275 \u219227.5 \u2192 no. \n\n53+55+57+59+61 \u2192285 \u219228.5 \u2192 no. \n\n55+57+59+61+63 \u2192295 \u219229.5 \u2192 no. \n\n57+59+61+63+65 \u2192305 \u219230.5 \u2192 no. \n\n59+61+63+65+67 \u2192315 \u219231.5 \u2192 no. \n\n61+63+65+67+69 \u2192325 \u219232.5 \u2192 no. \n\n63+65+67+69+71 \u2192335 \u219233.5 \u2192 no. \n\n65+67+69+71+73 \u2192345 \u219234.5 \u2192 no. \n\n67+69+71+73+75 \u2192355 \u219235.5 \u2192 no. \n\n69+71+73+75+77 \u2192365 \u219236.5 \u2192 no. \n\n71+73+75+77+79 \u2192375 \u219237.5 \u2192 no. \n\n73+75+77+79+81 \u2192385 \u219238.5 \u2192 no. \n\n75+77+79+81+83 \u2192395 \u219239.5 \u2192 no. \n\n77+79+81+83+85 \u2192405 \u219240.5 \u2192 no. \n\n79+81+83+85+87 \u2192415 \u219241.5 \u2192 no. \n\n81+83+85+87+89 \u2192425 \u219242.5 \u2192 no. \n\n83+85+87+89+91 \u2192435 \u219243.5 \u2192 no. \n\n85+87+89+91+93 \u2192445 \u219244.5 \u2192 no. \n\n87+89+91+93+95 \u2192455 \u219245.5 \u2192 no. \n\n89+91+93+95+97 \u2192465 \u219246.5 \u2192 no. \n\n91+93+95+97+99 \u2192475 \u219247.5 \u2192 no. \n\nWow, that's a lot. None of these sums divided by 10 give a perfect square. \n\nHmm, so this suggests there's no such sequence. But the question is giving options, so perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's constraints. \n\nWait, maybe the numbers are not necessarily consecutive in the sense of increment by 2 each time. Wait, but consecutive odd numbers must be like that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question allows the numbers to be in any order, but that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me try once again. \n\nThe problem states the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square. Let me denote the sum as S. So S/10 = k\u00b2 \u2192 S =10k\u00b2. \n\nThe five numbers are consecutive odd numbers. Let me denote them as a, a+2, a+4, a+6, a+8. \n\nTheir sum S =5a +20 =10k\u00b2 \u21925a =10k\u00b2 -20 \u2192 a = 2k\u00b2 -4. \n\nSo a must be a two-digit odd number. \n\nSo 2k\u00b2 -4 must be odd. Let's see:\n\n2k\u00b2 is even, minus 4 (even) \u2192 even minus even is even. So a must be even. \n\nBut a is the first number, which must be odd. Contradiction. \n\nSo this suggests that there is no solution. \n\nBut the problem gives options. So maybe there's a mistake in the question. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are three-digit? No, the question says two-digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the numbers to be even? Let me see option E is 44, which is even. Let me check that. \n\nIf the numbers can include even numbers, but the problem says \"consecutive two-digit odd numbers\", so no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says \"consecutive numbers\" not necessarily odd. But that's not what it says. \n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for the closest possible. Let's see the options given. Maybe one of them is in a sequence where the division is close to a perfect square, but the problem might have a typo. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sum formula. Wait, let me try to see for example if the numbers are 37,39,41,43,45. Their sum is 37+39=76 +41=117 +43=160 +45=205. 205 divided by 10 is 20.5, not a square. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem meant when divided by 5 becomes a square? Let me see. 205 divided by 5 is 41, which is a square? No, 41 isn't a square. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe divided by 5 and 2 separately? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant that the sum is a perfect square when divided by 10, but the division is integer division. Like, 225 divided by 10 is 22 (ignoring the decimal), which isn't a square. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a non-English source and there's a mistranslation. Like, maybe \"divided by 10\" should be \"divided by 5\", let me check that. \n\nIf the sum divided by 5 is a perfect square, then the sum would be 5k\u00b2. Let's see for example, if the sum is 5\u00d749=245. Then 245 divided by 5 is 49, which is a square. Let's see if such a sequence exists. \n\nSuppose the sum is 245. The average is 49, so the middle term is 49. The numbers would be 45,47,49,51,53. Their sum: 45+47=92 +49=141 +51=192 +53=245. Yes! \n\nSo the numbers are 45,47,49,51,53. The question asks which of the options can be one of these numbers. The options are 47 (option A), 41 (C), etc. So 47 is present here. So if the problem had said divided by 5, then the answer would be A)47. \n\nBut the question says divided by 10. So perhaps the problem has a typo. But given the options, maybe the intended answer is A)47. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the sum divided by 10 is a perfect square when rounded down? For example, if the sum is 245, then 245/10 is 24.5, which would round down to 24, not a square. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant that the average is divided by 10? The average is S/5, so (S/5)/10 = S/50 is a square. \n\nLet me see with the sequence above: 245/50=4.9 \u2192 not a square. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct, but the numbers are allowed to be three-digit? No, the question specifies two-digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem considers the square to be a perfect square of a decimal? Like 22.5 is sqrt(22.5) squared, but that's not an integer. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me think again. \n\nWait, if the numbers are five consecutive odd numbers, then their sum is 5m (where m is the middle term). So sum is 5m. \n\nDivided by 10: 5m/10 = m/2 = square. So m must be twice a square. But m must be odd (since it's an odd number). \n\nThus, m=2k\u00b2 must be odd. \n\nSo 2k\u00b2 is odd \u2192 k\u00b2 must be a non-integer? No, k must be an integer. \n\nWait, 2k\u00b2 is odd \u2192 which is impossible since 2k\u00b2 is even. \n\nThus, there's no solution. \n\nBut the options are there. So perhaps the problem allows for one of the numbers to be part of a sequence where the division is not exact but the square is close? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the sum divided by 10 to be a perfect square of a fraction. For instance, if the sum is 160, divided by 10 is 16, which is 4 squared. So 160 is divisible by 10, giving 16. \n\nWait, wait! 160 divided by 10 is 16, which is a perfect square. \n\nWait, let me check that. \n\nWait, 160 divided by 10 is 16. Which is 4 squared. \n\nSo the sum would need to be 160. Let me see if there's a sequence of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers that add to 160. \n\nThe average is 160/5 =32. So the middle term would be 32. But that's even. So no. \n\nHmm, but maybe the sequence is not centered around an integer? No, consecutive odd numbers must be spaced by 2. \n\nWait, the middle term must be the third number. So if the average is 32, then the numbers would be 30,32,34,36,38. But those are even. \n\nThus, no. \n\nWait another idea: the numbers are consecutive but not in the order. For example, maybe not starting at n but somewhere else. But consecutive odd numbers have to be in sequence. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are not in increasing order? No, the question says consecutive. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, what about sum 360? 360/10=36, a perfect square. \n\nLet me see if there are five consecutive two-digit odds adding to 360. \n\nAverage is 72. Middle term is 72, which is even. \n\nNo. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, what about sum 25? 25\u00d710=250 \u2192 sum 250. 250/5=50 \u2192 even. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the numbers to be consecutive, but not necessarily the first five? Like, maybe any five in a row from a larger sequence. \n\nBut the problem states \"the sum of the 5 consecutive two digit odd numbers\", so any such sequence. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a mistake and the answer is A)47, which is part of a sequence where the sum divided by 10 is 22.5, which is 4.743 squared, but that's not an integer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a possible k value. \n\nWait, in my first approach, the possible k values were up to 6 (k=6 gives n=68). But what if k is higher? \n\nWait, n has to be a two-digit number. For k=7: n=2*(7)^2 -4 = 2*49-4=98-4=94. 94 is two-digit, even. \n\nSo the sequence would be 94,96,98,100,102 \u2192 but 100 and 102 are three-digit, so invalid. \n\nk=7 gives n=94, which is two-digit, but the last term would be 94+8=102 \u2192 too big. \n\nSo n has to be \u2264 91. So 2k\u00b2 -4 \u226491 \u2192 2k\u00b2 \u226495 \u2192k\u00b2 \u226447.5 \u2192k up to 6. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows the numbers to be three-digit? Like, the last number could be 101, but the question says two-digit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the first number to be a three-digit? No. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me try with the numbers given in the options and see if any of them fit into a possible sequence. \n\nTake option A)47. Let's assume it's the third number. The sequence would be 43,45,47,49,51. Sum is 43+45=88, +47=135, +49=184, +51=235. 235 divided by 10 is 23.5 \u2192 not square. \n\nIf it's the second number: the sequence would be 41,43,45,47,49. Sum is 41+43=84 +45=129 +47=176 +49=225. 225 divided by 10 is 22.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf it's the fourth number: 43,45,47,49,51 \u2192 same as first case. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption B)91. If it's the last number, then the sequence is 83,85,87,89,91. Sum is 83+85=168 +87=255 +89=344 +91=435 \u2192435/10=43.5 \u2192 no. \n\nOption C)41. If it's the first term, the sequence is 41,43,45,47,49 \u2192 sum 225 \u2192 22.5. \n\nIf it's the third term, the sequence is 37,39,41,43,45 \u2192 sum 205 \u219220.5. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption D)67. If it's the third term, the sequence is 63,65,67,69,71 \u2192 sum 63+65=128 +67=195 +69=264 +71=335 \u2192335/10=33.5 \u2192 no. \n\nIf it's the fifth term: 61,63,65,67,69 \u2192 sum 61+63=124 +65=189 +67=256 +69=325 \u2192325/10=32.5 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, what if the numbers are not starting from a low number but somewhere else? Let me think of k=5 gives n=46. Even. So numbers would be 46,48,\u2026 but they must be odd. \n\nWait, perhaps the question allows the numbers to be even? Like, maybe it's a translation error and says \"consecutive two-digit numbers\" instead of \"odd\". \n\nIf that's the case, then the first approach would work. Let's try that. \n\nSuppose the numbers are consecutive two-digit numbers (could be even or odd). \n\nThen, sum is 5n +20. Divided by 10 is (n+4)/2 must be a perfect square. \n\nThen n can be even or odd. \n\nSo n = 2k\u00b2 -4. \n\nWe need n to be two-digit, so 10 \u22642k\u00b2 -4 \u226499 \u219214 \u22642k\u00b2 \u2264103 \u21927 \u2264k\u00b2 \u226451.5 \u2192k up to 7 (since 7\u00b2=49, 8\u00b2=64 too big). \n\nk=4 \u2192 n=2*16-4=28 \u2192 numbers 28,30,\u202632 \u2192 sum 28+30+32+34+36=160 \u2192160/10=16 \u21924\u00b2. \n\nYes! So this works. The numbers are 28,30,32,34,36. Their sum is 160 \u2192 divided by 10 gives 16, a perfect square. \n\nNow, the question says \"consecutive two-digit odd numbers\", but if it were just consecutive two-digit numbers, then the numbers could include even numbers and the answer would be 30,32 etc. But the options include 47, which is not in this sequence. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant \"consecutive odd numbers\" but there was a mistake, and the correct answer is 28, which is not in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the numbers to be in any order, but they have to be consecutive odds. \n\nWait, but even if that were the case, the sequence I found (28 etc.) are even numbers, so not applicable. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant that the five numbers are consecutive even numbers. Then the first example would work, but the options don't have 30 or 32. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that maybe the question allows the numbers to be three-digit. Like n=94 (k=7 gives n=94, which is two-digit, but the numbers would be 94,96,98,100,102. The last two are three-digit. So no. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me see the options again. The options include 47, which is in the sequence where the sum is 225 (which is 41-49). 225/10 is 22.5, which is not a perfect square. But 225 is 15 squared. So maybe the question meant that the sum itself is a perfect square, not divided by 10. Let's see. \n\nIf the sum is a perfect square, then 225 is 15\u00b2, which is a square. \n\nIn that case, the numbers are 41,43,45,47,49 \u2192 sum 225. So 47 is one of them. So option A)47 would be the answer. \n\nBut the question says \"when divided by 10 becomes a perfect square\". So 225 divided by 10 is 22.5 \u2192 not square. But if the question had said \"the sum is a perfect square\", then it would make sense. \n\nPerhaps there's a translation error or a typo. If I assume that the question meant the sum itself is a perfect square, then the answer would be A)47. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the division is by 5 instead of 10. Let's see. \n\n225 divided by5 is 45 \u2192 not square. \n\nSum 160 divided by5 is32 \u2192 no. \n\nSum 25 \u2192 sum is25, which is 5\u00b2. But that would require numbers like 1,3,5,7,9 \u2192 but they are single-digit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe divided by 20. For example, 225 divided by 20 is 11.25 \u2192 no. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that the options include 47, which is part of the sequence that sums to 225 (a perfect square), perhaps the problem had a typo and the division by 10 is incorrect. \n\nAssuming that the question requires the sum to be a perfect square, the answer would be 47 (option A). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant divided by 5. Let's see: 225 divided by5 is 45, not a square. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question requires that the sum divided by 10 is an integer which is a perfect square. So the sum must be divisible by 10. \n\nLooking at the sum 225 \u2192 225 mod10 is5 \u2192 not divisible. \n\nSum 235 \u2192 ends with 5 \u2192 no. \n\nSum 160 \u2192 divisible by 10 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo for sum 160, the numbers are 28,30,\u202632 \u2192 even numbers. \n\nThe options don't have any even numbers except E)44, which is even but not in that sequence. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question allows the numbers to be three-digit, but the first is two-digit. Like the sequence 94,96,98,100,102 \u2192 sum 490 \u2192 divided by 10 is49 \u21927\u00b2. So 49 is a perfect square. \n\nHere, the numbers are 94,96,98,100,102. But the first four are two-digit, the last two are three-digit. So the question specifies \"two-digit\", so invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are 99, 101,\u2026 but again three-digit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAt this point, I think there's likely a mistake in the problem's phrasing. But given the options, the most plausible answer is A)47 because it's part of a sequence whose sum is a perfect square (225=15\u00b2), which might have been the intended question. \n\nSo I'll go with option A.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding one of five consecutive two-digit odd numbers whose sum, when divided by 10, results in a perfect square. Let the numbers be \\( n, n+2, n+4, n+6, n+8 \\). Their sum is \\( 5n + 20 \\), so \\( \\frac{5n + 20}{10} = \\frac{n + 4}{2} \\) must be a perfect square. However, since \\( n \\) is odd, \\( \\frac{n + 4}{2} \\) is not an integer, leading to a contradiction. \n\nRe-evaluating possible sequences, consider the sum itself being a perfect square (a possible misinterpretation). For example, the sequence 41, 43, 45, 47, 49 sums to 225, a perfect square (15\u00b2). Though the problem specifies division by 10, this sequence includes 47 (option A), which fits the requirement if there was an error in the problem's phrasing.\n\nAnswer: A",
