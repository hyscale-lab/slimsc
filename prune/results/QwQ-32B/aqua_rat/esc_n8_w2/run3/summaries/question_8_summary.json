      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a train that changes speed after covering a quarter of the distance. I need to find the total journey duration. Hmm. Alright, step by step.\n\nFirst, the original speed is 100 miles per hour, and it takes 10 hours to reach the destination. So normally, the total distance must be speed multiplied by time. Let me calculate that. 100 mph * 10 hours equals 1000 miles. Wait, that seems like a lot, but maybe that's correct. Let me check again. Yeah, 100 times 10 is 1000. So the total distance is 1000 miles.\n\nNow, the problem says that after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining and the speed is reduced to 75 mph. So the first part is a quarter of the total distance, and the remaining three quarters are at the slower speed.\n\nLet me break it down. The first quarter distance is 1/4 of 1000, which is 250 miles. The remaining distance would be 750 miles.\n\nNow, for the first part: time equals distance divided by speed. So the time taken for the first quarter is 250 miles divided by 100 mph. That's 2.5 hours. Right, 250 divided by 100 is 2.5.\n\nThen, the second part is 750 miles at 75 mph. Time here would be 750 / 75. Let me calculate that. 75 times 10 is 750, so that's 10 hours. Wait, no, 75 times 10 is 750, so yes, exactly 10 hours. Wait, that seems straightforward. \n\nAdding both times together: 2.5 hours plus 10 hours equals 12.5 hours total. Oh, so the total journey duration would be 12.5 hours. Let me check the options. Option C is 12.5. \n\nWait a second, but the original time was 10 hours. So if part of the trip is slower, the total time should be longer than 10, which 12.5 is. The options include C as 12.5, so that must be the answer. Let me just verify all steps again to be sure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nOriginal distance: 100 *10 =1000. Correct. Quarter is 250. Time for first part: 250/100 =2.5. The remaining 750 at 75 mph: 750/75 =10. Total 12.5. Yep. Looks right. So the answer should be C.\n",
