      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so here's this problem about two cars starting from opposite ends of a highway that's 50 miles long. One car is going 12 mph and the other 13 mph. I need to figure out how long until they meet. Hmm, let me think.\n\nAlright, first, since they're starting from opposite ends, their distances from the starting point will add up to 50 miles when they meet. Wait, no, actually when they meet, the sum of the distances each has traveled should equal the total length of the highway. That makes sense. So maybe I can set up an equation where the distance each car travels adds up to 50 miles.\n\nLet me denote the time they travel until meeting as t hours. Then the first car would have gone 12t miles, and the second car 13t miles. Adding those two distances should give the total distance between them, which is 50 miles. So, 12t + 13t = 50. \n\nAdding those together gives 25t = 50. Wait, 12 plus 13 is 25. So solving for t would be 50 divided by 25, which is 2. Wait, but that would be 2 hours? Let me check the options. Option E is 2, so maybe that's the answer? But wait, let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm mixing something up. Let's see. The cars are moving towards each other, so their relative speed is the sum of their speeds. Oh right, that's another way to think about it. So the combined speed is 12 +13 =25 mph. The distance between them is 50 miles. Time is distance divided by speed, so 50 /25 =2 hours. That gives the same result as before. So the answer would be E) 2?\n\nBut wait, the options given include 2 as E, but the options also have 1.75 and others. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the calculation again.\n\nWait, 12 +13 is indeed 25 mph. So the time until meeting is 50 divided by 25. 50/25 is 2. So that's correct. So the answer must be E) 2. But let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question.\n\nThe highway is 50 miles long. So the two cars start at opposite ends, so the distance between them is exactly 50 miles. Since they are moving towards each other, their closing speed is the sum of their speeds. Therefore, time until meeting is 50/(12+13)=2. So that's right. The answer is E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine when the two cars will meet, we calculate their combined speed and use the total distance.

I need to find out how long until they meet. Hmm, let me think.\n\nAlright, when two objects are moving towards each other, their speeds add up, right? Like, the combined speed makes them close the distance between them faster. So the first step is probably to add their speeds together. Let me check that idea.\n\nThe highway is 50 miles long. So the total distance between them at the start is 50 miles. If car A is going 12 mph and car B is going 13 mph, then every hour, the distance between them decreases by 12 +13 =25 miles. Oh right, because they're moving towards each other, so their speeds add. So the time it takes for them to meet should be the total distance divided by the combined speed.\n\nSo time = distance / speed. That would be 50 miles divided by 25 mph. Let me do that calculation. 50 divided by 25 is 2. Wait, but looking at the options, 2 is option E. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the options include 1.25, 1.5, etc. Hmm. Did I do the addition right? 12 +13 is definitely 25. 50 divided by 25 is indeed 2 hours. But the options have E as 2, so that would be the answer? But maybe I messed up the setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of equations. Let me set up the problem again.

Since they're moving towards each other, the sum of these distances should equal the total length of the highway when they meet. So 12t +13t =50. That adds up to 25t =50, so t=2.
