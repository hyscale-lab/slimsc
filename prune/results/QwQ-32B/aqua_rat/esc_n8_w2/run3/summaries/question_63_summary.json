      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab that has a specific fare structure. Hmm, the first part is $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. Then, after that, it's 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile. I need to figure out how far that money can take me.\n\nFirst, I should break down the costs. The initial charge is for the first quarter-mile, which is 0.25 miles. So that's a flat fee of $3.50 no matter what. The remaining money after that will go towards the additional quarter-miles. \n\nLet me subtract the initial cost from the total money to see how much is left for the extra distance. So $8.50 minus $3.50 equals $5.00. Right, so $5 left for the additional quarters.\n\nEach additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents. Wait, 10 cents per quarter-mile. So how many of those can I get with $5? Let me calculate that. Since each is $0.10, dividing $5 by $0.10 gives the number of quarter-miles. 5 divided by 0.1 is 50. So 50 quarter-miles. \n\nBut wait, each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles. So 50 times 0.25 miles would be the additional distance beyond the first quarter-mile. Let me compute that. 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. \n\nWait a second, but the first part was a quarter mile. So total distance is the initial 0.25 plus 12.5. Adding those together: 0.25 + 12.5 equals 12.75 miles. Hmm, that looks like option B. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nSo starting with $8.50. Subtract the initial $3.50, which leaves $5.00. Each additional quarter mile is 10 cents, so 5 / 0.10 is indeed 50. Each of those is 0.25 miles. 50 * 0.25 is 12.5. Adding the first 0.25 gives 12.75 total. The options have B as 12.75, so that should be correct. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the arithmetic. 50 times 0.25: 50 divided by 4 is 12.5, yes. Then adding the first 0.25 makes 12.75. So yes, the answer must be B.\n",
