      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a flagstaff and a building's shadow. Let me see, the question is asking for the height of the building when it casts a shadow of 28.75 meters, given that a 17.5-meter flagstaff casts a 40.25-meter shadow. Hmm, right, this sounds like a proportion problem. Because the conditions are similar, the ratios of height to shadow length should be the same, right?\n\nAlright, let me think. The idea is that the height and shadow length are directly proportional. So, if I set up a ratio of height over shadow length for both the flagstaff and the building, they should be equal. \n\nSo the flagstaff's ratio is 17.5 / 40.25. And the building's ratio would be the unknown height (let's call it h) divided by 28.75. The equation would be 17.5 / 40.25 = h / 28.75. Then I can solve for h.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that right. The two ratios should be equal because the sun's angle is the same, so the triangles formed by the objects and their shadows are similar. Yep, that makes sense. So similar triangles have proportional sides.\n\nNow, solving for h. Let me compute the left side first. 17.5 divided by 40.25. Let me do that division. Hmm, maybe I can simplify the fractions. Let's see, both numbers can be divided by 0.25 perhaps? 17.5 divided by 0.25 is 70, and 40.25 divided by 0.25 is 161. So that gives 70/161. Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, cross-multiplying might be easier here.\n\nAlternatively, cross-multiplying the equation: 17.5 * 28.75 = h * 40.25. Then h = (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25. Let me calculate that.\n\nHmm, let me compute 17.5 multiplied by 28.75 first. 17.5 times 28 is 490, and 17.5 times 0.75 is 13.125. So adding those together gives 490 +13.125 = 503.125. Wait, wait, actually, maybe breaking it down differently. Let me see: 28.75 is 28 and three quarters. Alternatively, 28.75 can be written as 28 + 0.75. But perhaps another approach. Alternatively, 17.5 * 28.75. Let me compute this step by step.\n\nAlternatively, 17.5 multiplied by 28.75. Let me convert them into fractions. 17.5 is the same as 35/2, and 28.75 is 115/4 (since 28.75 *4 = 115). So 35/2 multiplied by 115/4 equals (35*115)/(2*4) = (3925)/8. Then the denominator is 40.25 which is 161/4. So the equation is h = (3925/8) divided by (161/4). Dividing fractions is multiplying by reciprocal, so (3925/8) * (4/161) = (3925 *4)/(8*161). Let me compute that.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so 3925 *0.5 = 1962.5, and then divided by 161. Wait, maybe another way. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, 3925 divided by 161 first. Let's see: 161 times 24 is 3864 (since 160*24=3840 and 1*24=24, so total 3864). Then 3925 - 3864 = 61. So 3925/161 = 24 + 61/161. Hmm, that's 24.38? Not sure if this is helpful. Maybe I should just do the calculation with decimals.\n\nAlternatively, let me try doing the original equation again with decimals. Let's see:\n\n17.5 * 28.75 = ?\n\nLet me compute 17 *28.75 first, then 0.5 *28.75, and add them.\n\n17 *28.75: 10*28.75=287.5; 7*28.75=201.25. So 287.5+201.25 = 488.75.\n\nThen 0.5 *28.75 is 14.375.\n\nAdding those together: 488.75 +14.375 = 503.125.\n\nSo the numerator is 503.125. The denominator is 40.25. So h = 503.125 /40.25.\n\nLet me divide that. Let's see, 40.25 times 12 is 483 (since 40*12=480, 0.25*12=3, so total 483). 503.125 minus 483 is 20.125. So 12 + (20.125 /40.25). \n\nHmm, 20.125 divided by 40.25 is the same as 20.125/(40.25). Let me see, 40.25 divided by 2 is 20.125. Exactly! So 20.125 /40.25 = 0.5. \n\nTherefore total h =12 +0.5=12.5. Oh, so that gives 12.5 meters. So the answer is B?\n\nWait, let me check again. Because 40.25 multiplied by 12.5 equals?\n\nLet me do 40.25 *12.5. 40 *12.5 is 500, and 0.25*12.5 is 3.125. So total 503.125. Which matches the numerator. So yes, that's correct. So the height is 12.5 meters. So option B.\n\nHmm, but let me make sure there are no calculation errors here. Let me recheck the multiplication steps again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Since the ratio of the shadows is 28.75 /40.25. Let me see, maybe I can set up the proportion as (height of building)/(height of flagstaff) = (shadow of building)/(shadow of flagstaff). So h/17.5 =28.75/40.25. Then h =17.5*(28.75/40.25). \n\nSo let me compute 28.75 divided by 40.25 first. Let's see, 28.75 /40.25. Both can be multiplied by 100 to eliminate decimals: 2875 /4025. Let me simplify this fraction. Let's see if both numbers can be divided by 25: 2875 \u00f725 is 115, 4025 \u00f725 is 161. So now it's 115/161. \n\nHmm, can this be simplified further? Let's see. 115 is 5\u00d723, and 161 is 7\u00d723. Oh, so both have a common factor of 23. So 115 \u00f723=5, 161 \u00f723=7. So the simplified fraction is 5/7. \n\nOh! That's a key step I might have missed earlier. So 28.75/40.25 reduces to 5/7. Therefore h=17.5*(5/7). Let me calculate that. \n\n17.5 divided by 7 is 2.5, multiplied by 5 gives 12.5. So yes, same answer. That's much simpler. So that confirms it. The answer is B)12.5 meters.\n\nI think that's solid. The key was realizing that the shadow ratio simplifies to 5/7, which makes the calculation straightforward. I should have thought to simplify the fractions earlier. But either way, the answer comes out the same. So I'm confident it's B.\n",

Hmm, right, this should be a similar triangles problem because the sun's angle would be the same, so the ratios should be proportional.\n\nAlright, so the idea is that the height of the object divided by the length of its shadow is the same for both the flagstaff and the building. Because the conditions are similar, the ratio of height to shadow length should be equal. Let me write that down as an equation.\n\nLet me denote the height of the building as h. Then according to the problem, the ratio for the flagstaff is 17.5 / 40.25, and for the building, it's h / 28.75. These two ratios should be equal. So:\n\n17.5 / 40.25 = h / 28.75\n\nNow I need to solve for h. Let me cross-multiply to do that. So:\n\n17.5 * 28.75 = h * 40.25\n\nHmm, calculating the left side. Let me compute 17.5 multiplied by 28.75. Hmm, maybe break it down. 17.5 times 28 is 490, and 17.5 times 0.75 is 13.125. Adding those together gives 490 + 13.125 = 503.125. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 17.5 * 28.75. Alternatively, maybe 28.75 * 17.5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using decimals is better. Let's see:\n\n28.75 multiplied by 17.5. Let me compute 28.75 * 17.5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 28.75 * 17.5 can be calculated as (28 + 0.75)*(17 + 0.5). But maybe it's easier to do 28.75 * 17.5.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of 17.5 as 70/4? Or maybe 17.5 is 35/2. Hmm, perhaps converting to fractions might help. Let me see:\n\n17.5 is the same as 35/2, and 28.75 is 115/4 (since 28.75 = 28 + 3/4, which is 112/4 + 3/4 = 115/4). So 35/2 multiplied by 115/4 equals (35*115)/(2*4) = (35*115)/8.\n\nWait, but maybe I should just do the multiplication step by step. Let's see:\n\n28.75 * 17.5:\n\nFirst, multiply 28.75 by 10, that's 287.5. Then 28.75 * 7.5 is ?\n\nWait, 28.75 * 17.5 is 28.75*(10 +7.5)=287.5 + (28.75*7.5). Let me compute 28.75*7.5.\n\n28.75 *7 = 201.25, and 28.75 *0.5 is 14.375. Adding those gives 201.25 +14.375=215.625. So total is 287.5 +215.625 = 503.125. Okay, so that's the left side of the equation: 503.125 = h *40.25.\n\nSo to find h, I divide both sides by 40.25. So h = 503.125 /40.25.\n\nHmm, let me compute that division. Let me see.\n\nFirst, maybe convert both numbers to fractions. 503.125 is equal to 503 + 0.125 = 503 + 1/8. So 503*8 is 4024, plus 1 is 4025, so 4025/8. Wait, wait, 503.125 = 503 1/8, which is (503 *8 +1)/8 = (4024 +1)/8 = 4025/8.\n\nAnd 40.25 is 40 and 1/4, which is 161/4 (since 40*4 is 160 +1 is 161).\n\nSo now, h is (4025/8) divided by (161/4) = (4025/8) * (4/161) = (4025 *4)/(8*161) = (4025)/(2*161) = 4025 / 322.\n\nHmm, let me compute 4025 divided by 322.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps simplify numerator and denominator. Let me see if 161 is a factor of 4025. 161*25 is 4025? Let's see: 160*25 is 4000, plus 1*25 is 25, so 4025. Yes! So 4025 = 161 *25. Therefore, 4025 / (322) = (161*25)/(161 * 2) ) = 25/2 = 12.5. Oh! That's neat. So h is 12.5 meters.\n\nWait, so that would be option B?\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA)12\n\nB)12.5\n\nC)13.5\n\nD)14\n\nE)15\n\nSo the answer must be B) 12.5 meters. Let me just check the calculations again to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, let me do the division 503.125 divided by 40.25 another way. Let's see:\n\n40.25 times 12 is 483. 40.25 *12.5 would be 40.25*12 +40.25*0.5 = 483 +20.125 = 503.125. Exactly. So yes, 12.5 is correct. So the answer is B.\n",

Then according to the problem, the ratio for the flagstaff is 17.5 / 40.25, and for the building, it's h / 28.75. These two ratios should be equal. So:\n\n17.5 / 40.25 = h / 28.75\n\nNow I need to solve for h. Let me cross-multiply to do that. So:\n\n17.5 * 28.75 = h * 40.25\n\nHmm, calculating the left side. Let me compute 17.5 multiplied by 28.75. Hmm, maybe break it down. 17.5 times 28 is 490, and 17.5 times 0.75 is 13.125. Adding those together gives 490 + 13.125 = 503.125. Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 17.5 * 28.75. Alternatively, maybe 28.75 * 17.5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using decimals is better. Let's see:\n\n28.75 multiplied by 17.5. Let me compute 28.75 * 17.5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps 28.75 * 17.5 can be calculated as (28 + 0.75)*(17 + 0.5). But maybe it's easier to do 28.75 * 17.5.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of 17.5 as 70/4? Or maybe 17.5 is 35/2. Hmm, perhaps converting to fractions might help. Let me see:\n\n17.5 is the same as 35/2, and 28.75 is 115/4 (since 28.75 = 28 + 3/4, which is 112/4 + 3/4 = 115/4). So 35/2 multiplied by 115/4 equals (35*115)/(2*4) = (35*115)/8.\n\nWait, but maybe I should just do the multiplication step by step. Let's see:\n\n28.75 * 17.5:\n\nFirst, multiply 28.75 by 10, that's 287.5. Then 28.75 * 7.5 is ?\n\nWait, 28.75 * 17.5 is 28.75*(10 +7.5)=287.5 + (28.75*7.5). Let me compute 28.75*7.5.\n\n28.75 *7 = 201.25, and 28.75 *0.5 is 14.375. Adding those gives 201.25 +14.375=215.625. So total is 287.5 +215.625 = 503.125. Okay, so that's the left side of the equation: 503.125 = h *40.25.\n\nSo to find h, I divide both sides by 40.25. So h = 503.125 /40.25.\n\nHmm, let me compute that division. Let me see.\n\nFirst, maybe convert both numbers to fractions. 503.125 is equal to 503 + 0.125 = 503 + 1/8. So 503*8 is 4024, plus 1 is 4025, so 4025/8. Wait, wait, 503.125 = 503 1/8, which is (503 *8 +1)/8 = (4024 +1)/8 = 4025/8.\n\nAnd 40.25 is 40 and 1/4, which is 161/4 (since 40*4 is 160 +1 is 161).\n\nSo now, h is (4025/8) divided by (161/4) = (4025/8) * (4/161) = (4025 *4)/(8*161) = (4025)/(2*161) = 4025 / 322.\n\nHmm, let me compute 4025 divided by 322.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps simplify numerator and denominator. Let me see if 161 is a factor of 4025. 161*25 is 4025? Let's see: 160*25 is 4000, plus 1*25 is 25, so 4025. Yes! So 4025 = 161 *25. Therefore, 4025 / (322) = (161*25)/(161 * 2) ) = 25/2 = 12.5. Oh! That's neat. So h is 12.5 meters.\n\nWait, so that would be option B?\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA)12\n\nB)12.5\n\nC)13.5\n\nD)14\n\nE)15\n\nSo the answer must be B) 12.5 meters. Let me just check the calculations again to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, let me do the division 503.125 divided by 40.25 another way. Let's see:\n\n40.25 times 12 is 483. 40.25 *12.5 would be 40.25*12 +40.25*0.5 = 483 +20.125 = 503.125. Exactly. So yes, 12.5 is correct. So the answer is B.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the height of a building using the proportionality of shadows under similar conditions. The ratio of the flagstaff's height to its shadow length (17.5 m / 40.25 m) must equal the ratio of the building's height (h) to its shadow (28.75 m). Setting up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{17.5}{40.25} = \\frac{h}{28.75}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n17.5 \\times 28.75 = h \\times 40.25\n\\]\n\nCalculating the left side: \\(17.5 \\times 28.75 = 503.125\\). Solving for \\(h\\):\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{503.125}{40.25} = 12.5\n\\]\n\nVerification confirms that \\(40.25 \\times 12.5 = 503.125\\), validating the result. The correct answer is **B) 12.5 metre**.\n\nAnswer: B",
