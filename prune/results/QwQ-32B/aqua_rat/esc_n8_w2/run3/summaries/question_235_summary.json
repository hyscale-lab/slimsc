      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. The question is about a discount and finding the actual selling price. Hmm, wait, the problem says Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 during a sale where everything had a 20% discount. The question is asking for the actual selling price. Wait, I need to be careful here. Oh right, maybe I need to figure out the original price before the discount? Because the actual selling price after discount is what he paid, which is 4578. But the options don't have that. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the terms here.\n\nLet me read the question again. The actual selling price of the article. Wait, perhaps the \"actual selling price\" refers to the original price before the discount? Because the sale price is after the discount. So maybe the question is phrased such that the discount was applied to the original price, and the actual selling price (original) is what we need to find. Because the amount he paid (4578) would be the discounted price. So the question is, what was the original price?\n\nSo the formula here would be: Discounted price = Original price - (Discount % * Original price). Alternatively, the discounted price is 80% of the original price because 20% is taken off. So 4578 equals 80% of the original price. So to find the original, we can divide 4578 by 0.8.\n\nLet me calculate that. Let's see, 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 4578 divided by 0.8 is the same as 4578 multiplied by 1.25. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 4578 * 1.25. Breaking it down: 4578 * 1 = 4578, and 4578 * 0.25 is 1144.5. Adding them together: 4578 + 1144.5 equals 5722.5. Wait, that's close to option B, which is 5723. But let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me do it step by step. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's compute 4578 divided by 0.8. 0.8 times 5000 is 4000, so 5000 would give 4000. The remaining 578? Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think of 4578 divided by 0.8 as (4578 *10)/8. Because 0.8 is 8/10, so dividing by 8/10 is multiplying by 10/8. So (4578 *10) = 45780, divided by 8. Let's do that division.\n\n45780 divided by 8. 8*5000 is 40000. Subtract that from 45780: 5780 left. 8*700 is 5600. So 5000 + 700 =5700, remainder 180. 180 divided by 8 is 22.5. So total is 5700 + 22.5 = 5722.5. So that rounds to 5723, which is option B. \n\nWait, but the options have B as 5723. So that must be the correct answer. Let me check the options again. The options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. So B is the one. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The actual selling price might refer to the price after discount, but that's what he paid, which is given as 4578. Since that's not among the options, except maybe if there's a trick. But the question says \"actual selling price\" \u2014 maybe the term \"actual\" here refers to the original marked price before discount. Because sometimes, in some contexts, the selling price can be the price after discount, but maybe the problem is using \"actual selling price\" as the original price. Because otherwise, the answer would be 4578, which isn't an option. So the question must be asking for the original price before the discount. So the calculation I did is correct, leading to 5722.5, which is approximately 5723, so B.\n",

Hmm, wait, maybe I need to clarify the terms here. \n\nSo, normally, the \"actual selling price\" might refer to the original price before the discount, right? Because the sale price he paid is after the discount. Let me make sure. The question is phrased a bit confusingly. Let me read again: \"What was the actual selling price of the article?\" Wait, sometimes \"actual selling price\" could be the price after discount, but the options here are higher than 4578. The options given are A to E, with most options higher than 4578 except maybe some. Let me check the options again. The options are A) 5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. All these are higher than 4578 except none. So that suggests that the question is asking for the original price before the discount. Because the actual selling price in the sale is 4578, so the original price would be higher. The wording is a bit tricky here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the term \"actual selling price\" here refers to the original marked price, and the discounted price is the sale price. So the question is asking for the original price before the discount. Because the discount was applied to get the sale price. So the problem is, if the sale price after 20% discount is 4578, what was the original price?\n\nSo the formula would be: Sale price = Original price - 20% of Original price. So that's 80% of the original. So Original price = Sale price divided by 0.8. Let me compute that. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me do the math.\n\nFirst, 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's see: 4578 divided by 0.8 is the same as 4578 multiplied by 1.25. Because 1 divided by 0.8 is 1.25. Alternatively, 4578 / 0.8 = ?\n\nAlternatively, 4578 divided by 8 is 572.25, then multiplied by 10 gives 5722.5? Wait, let me check that again. Wait, 4578 divided by 0.8:\n\nLet me compute 4578 \u00f7 0.8:\n\nWell, 0.8 times x = 4578, so x = 4578 /0.8.\n\nDividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 10/8, which is 5/4 (1.25). So 4578 * 1.25.\n\nLet me compute that step by step. 4578 * 1.25.\n\nBreaking down 1.25 into 1 + 0.25. So 4578 *1 is 4578, plus 4578 *0.25.\n\n4578 * 0.25 is the same as 4578 divided by 4. Let's compute that:\n\n4578 divided by 4: 4578 \u00f74. 4*1144 = 4576, so 1144.5. Because 4*1144 = 4576, so remainder 2, so 0.5. So 1144.5.\n\nSo adding 4578 + 1144.5 equals 4578 + 1144.5.\n\nLet me add those numbers:\n\n4578 + 1144.5: 4578 + 1000 is 5578, plus 144.5 is 5578 + 144.5 = 5722.5. So the original price would be 5722.5. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 5723, which is very close. Probably the correct answer is B. But let me check if I did the calculations correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me try another way. Let's compute 4578 divided by 0.8:\n\nLet me write it as (4578 *10)/8 = 45780 /8.\n\nDividing 45780 by 8:\n\n8 * 5000 = 40,000. Subtract that from 45,780 gives 5,780.\n\n8 * 700 = 5,600. So that's 5000 +700 =5700, and remaining 180.\n\n8*22.5 is 180. So total is 5700 +22.5 = 5722.5. So same result. So that's 5722.5. The options have 5723 (B) and 5050 (A). So B is the closest, but since the options are in whole numbers, perhaps it's rounded. So the correct answer must be B.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) 5050\n\nB)5723\n\nC)5040\n\nD)4950\n\nE)4870\n\nSo 5722.5 would be approximately 5723, so B is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the question. The question says, \"actual selling price\". Wait, perhaps the term \"actual selling price\" is the price after discount, but that would be 4578, which is not listed as any option. Since all options are higher, that can't be. So the question must be asking for the original marked price, which is the actual price before discount. So the answer is B.\n",
