      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the store starts with 600 golf balls total, both yellow and white. They sold 80% of their inventory by the end of the day. So first, I need to figure out how many balls they sold in total. 80% of 600 is... let me calculate that. 600 times 0.8 equals 480. So they sold 480 balls that day. \n\nNow, the problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Wait, but also it mentions that in doing so, they sold all of their white golf balls. Oh, right, so all the white balls were sold, but some yellow ones remained? Because if they sold all white, then the number of white balls sold is equal to the total number of white balls they had. And since the number of yellow sold is the same as white sold, that means they sold the same number of yellow as white. \n\nLet me define variables. Let me call Y the number of yellow balls initially, and W the white ones. So Y + W = 600. \n\nThey sold 80% of total inventory, which is 480. The total sold is the sum of yellow sold plus white sold. But since they sold all the white balls, white sold is W. And the yellow sold is equal to white sold, so that's also W. Therefore, total sold is W (white) + W (yellow) = 2W. \n\nBut the total sold is 480, so 2W = 480. Solving for W gives W = 240. Wait, but if W is 240, then Y would be 600-240=360. But hold on, if they sold all the white balls (240), then the yellow sold is also 240. So the yellow remaining would be Y - 240. But the problem didn't mention anything about remaining yellows except that they didn't sell all of them, since they sold all whites. Wait, but maybe the problem allows that they could have sold all yellows too, but the key is that they sold equal numbers of each. But the problem says \"sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls\" and \"sold all of its white golf balls\". So the number of white sold is equal to the initial white count. The number of yellow sold must equal that, so the yellow sold is equal to the white's initial number. But the yellow can't be sold more than they had. So the initial yellow must be at least the number of white sold. \n\nWait, let me check again. Let me think again step by step.\n\nTotal balls initially: Y + W = 600.\n\nTotal sold: 80% of 600 = 480.\n\nThe number of white sold is W (since all were sold). The number of yellow sold is equal to the white sold, so that's also W. So total sold is W (white) + W (yellow) = 2W = 480. Therefore, 2W =480 \u2192 W=240. So white initially were 240, so yellow were 600-240=360. \n\nWait, but if they sold 240 yellow balls, then the remaining yellow would be 360-240=120. But the problem doesn't say anything about the remaining yellows. Is there a problem here? The question is asking for the initial number of yellow balls, which would be 360, which is option E. But let me check the options. The options include E)360. Hmm, but let me see if I made a mistake here. Wait, but let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white. So the number sold of each is the same. But the white sold is all of their stock, so white sold = W. Therefore, yellow sold must also be W, so that's equal. Therefore, the total sold is W + W = 2W = 480. So W is 240, so Y is 360. That seems correct. \n\nWait, but one of the options is E)360, so that would be the answer. But let me check the options again. The options are A)80, B)120, C)240, D)320, E)360. So E is 360. \n\nWait, but maybe I missed something. Let me see another approach. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that the store sold 80% of their inventory. So total sold is 480, so remaining is 120. The remaining would be the yellow not sold, since all white were sold. So the remaining balls are Y - (number of yellow sold). Since they sold same number of yellow as white, and white sold is all W, so yellow sold is W. Therefore remaining yellow is Y - W. \n\nThe total remaining is (Y - W) + 0 (since all white sold) = Y - W. And that must equal 20% of original stock, which is 120. So Y - W = 120. \n\nAlso, we know Y + W = 600. \n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\nY + W = 600,\n\nY - W = 120.\n\nAdding both equations: 2Y = 720 \u2192 Y = 360. So that's the same answer as before. So the answer must be E)360. \n\nHmm, but why is option C)240 here? Maybe a common mistake. Let me see. Suppose someone thought that the number of white was 240, but that's the W, which is correct. So the answer is E. So I think the correct answer is E.\n",
