      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about creating 3-letter codes with vowels and consonants under certain conditions. Hmm, so I need to break down the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, the code has three letters. The middle one must be a vowel. The first and third letters have to be consonants, and they also need to be different from each other. Oh right, and there are 5 vowels and 20 consonants available. \n\nLet me think of each position separately. The middle letter is a vowel. Since vowels are 5, that's straightforward. So for the middle letter, there are 5 choices.\n\nNow the first and third letters are consonants, but they must be different. Wait, so first consonant can be any of the 20, but the third has to be a consonant that's not the same as the first. So for the first letter, 20 options. Then for the third, it would be 19 left because you can't choose the same as the first. \n\nSo multiplying those together: first letter (20), middle (5), third (19). Let me check the order of multiplication. The total number of codes would be 20 * 5 * 19. Let me calculate that.\n\n20 multiplied by 5 is 100. Then 100 multiplied by 19. 100*19 is 1900. Wait, but that would be option E, which is 1900. But hold on, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nWait, the problem says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\". Does that mean that the vowels are different from the consonants? Like, no overlap? I think so, because vowels and consonants are separate. So vowels are 5 distinct letters, consonants are 20 others. So that part is okay.\n\nAnother thing: the first and third letters must be consonants and different from each other. So yes, first is 20, third is 19. Middle is 5. So total is 20*5*19. Let me compute that again. 20 times 19 is 380, then times 5 is 1900. Hmm, so that would be option E. But wait, the options given include 1,980 (A) and others. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, maybe the first and third letters can be same consonants? No, the problem says \"the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other\". Oh right, so they must be different. So my initial calculation is correct. Then why is the answer not E? Let me check the options again. The options are A)1980, B)2020, C)2100, D)2200, E)1900. So E is 1900, which matches my calculation. But wait, maybe I misread the problem?\n\nWait the problem says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\". Does that mean that the total letters are 25, but when choosing the consonants for first and third letters, are they allowed to repeat? Like, if consonants can be reused? But the condition says first and third must be different. So they can't be the same consonant. So even if consonants could be reused otherwise, the condition requires them to be different. So the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misapplied the multiplication. Let me recalculate:\n\n20 (first consonant) * 5 (vowel) * 19 (third consonant different from first). So 20*5 is 100, 100*19 is 1900. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer should be E. But wait, the options include A)1980. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the first and third letters are allowed to be same consonant except when they have to be different. Wait, the problem says \"the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other\". So they must be different. So I think my calculation is right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem allows the third letter to be same as the middle letter? But the middle is a vowel and third is a consonant, so they can't be same. So that's okay. \n\nHmm, so maybe the answer is E. But the options given have E as 1900. But let me check if there's another way. Wait, perhaps I misread the vowels and consonants count. The problem says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\"\u2014so vowels are 5, consonants 20, total letters 25. \n\nWait another thought: when choosing consonants for first and third letters, since they must be different consonants, the number is 20 * 19. The vowel is 5. So total is 20*19*5. Which is same as before. 20*19=380, 380*5=1900. \n\nHmm. So the correct answer should be E. But I remember sometimes when there are permutations, maybe the order matters. Wait, but in this case, the positions are fixed: first consonant, then vowel, then consonant. So the calculation is correct. \n\nWait the options have E as 1900. But let me check again the problem's exact wording. \n\n\"John would make the 3-letter codes with different 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant.\"\n\nAh, the wording says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\"\u2014maybe that \"different\" is modifying the vowels and consonants, meaning that all letters in the code must be different? Wait, that's possible. Wait, the problem says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\"\u2014maybe that's just stating that there are 5 distinct vowels and 20 distinct consonants available. So the letters can be used more than once unless restricted. \n\nWait the key part is the condition. The condition is that the first and third letters must be different from each other. But there's no restriction between the first and middle, or third and middle. So for example, the first consonant can be same as the vowel? Wait, but vowels and consonants are different letters. So since vowels and consonants are separate, the consonants can't be vowels, so there's no overlap. So the middle letter is a vowel, so it's different from the consonants. So the only restriction is between first and third letters. \n\nTherefore, the calculation should indeed be 20 *5 *19 = 1900. So answer is E. \n\nWait but the options given include 1980. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait perhaps the first and third letters can be same consonant, but the problem says they must be different. So no, they can't. So I think the answer must be E. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows consonants to be repeated except when the first and third must be different. So the first and third have to be different, so that's consonant (20) * consonant (19). Middle is vowel (5). So yes, 20*19*5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. \n\nThe problem says: \"the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant\". So yes, exactly. So the first is consonant (20 options), third is consonant but different from first (19 options). Middle is vowel (5). So 20 *5 *19 = 1900. So the answer must be E. \n\nHmm. Maybe the options are wrong? But that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me check again: 20 \u00d75 is 100. 100 \u00d719 is 1900. Yes. \n\nSo the correct answer should be E)1900. But the options given include that, so I think that's right.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, John is making 3-letter codes with vowels and consonants. The conditions are that the middle letter must be a vowel, and the first and third letters are consonants that must be different from each other. Hmm, right. Let me parse the details again.\n\nFirst, the vowels and consonants are different. Wait, the question says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\". Wait, maybe that's just saying there are 5 different vowels and 20 different consonants available? Or does it mean that the letters used must be different? Hmm, the wording says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\". Maybe it's just the total number of vowels and consonants available. Like, there are 5 vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and 20 consonants. So each code is made using these letters, but with certain conditions.\n\nThe code is 3 letters. The structure is consonant-vowel-consonant, but the first and third letters (the consonants) must be different. Let me think.\n\nSo the positions are:\n\n1st letter: consonant\n\n2nd letter: vowel\n\n3rd letter: consonant, which must be different from the first consonant.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFirst, choose the first consonant. There are 20 options.\n\nSecond, choose the vowel. Since there are 5 vowels, so 5 options.\n\nThird, choose the third consonant. Since it has to be different from the first consonant, so after choosing the first consonant, there are 19 left.\n\nSo the total number would be 20 (for first consonant) multiplied by 5 (vowel) multiplied by 19 (third consonant). Let me calculate that: 20 * 5 is 100, 100 *19 is 1900? Wait but wait, hold on. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, 20 * 5 is 100. 100 * 19 is indeed 1900. But looking at the options, E is 1900, but option A is 1980 and others. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\". Wait, perhaps that's a typo? Like maybe \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\" as in the letters must be different? Wait no, the wording is a bit unclear. Wait, the question says \"John would make the 3-letter codes with different 5 vowels and 20 consonants...\" Hmm, maybe that part is just stating that there are 5 vowels and 20 consonants to choose from. Like the available letters are 5 vowels and 20 consonants. So each code uses letters from those, but the letters in the code can be repeated unless restricted by the conditions. Wait, the problem says \"the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other\". So consonants first and third letters must be different. The vowel can be same as either? Wait, the problem says \"the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant\".\n\nWait the problem's exact wording is: \"the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant.\"\n\nWait, the way it's phrased might mean that the first and third letters are both consonants and must be different from each other. The middle is a vowel. So consonants for first and third, which must be different. Vowel in the middle. So vowels can be any of the 5, but are there any restrictions on vowels? Like, can the vowel be the same as the first or third consonant? Wait, probably not, because vowels and consonants are different letters. Wait, vowels are separate from consonants. So vowels and consonants are distinct sets. So the middle letter is a vowel (so from the 5), and the first and third letters are consonants (from the 20), but first and third consonants must be different.\n\nSo the calculation is indeed 20 * 5 * 19. Let's compute that again. 20 * 5 is 100, 100 *19=1900. Which is option E. But the options given include E as 1900, so that would be the answer?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Wait, maybe the problem requires that all three letters must be different? The problem says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\"\u2014 maybe that's just the available letters, not that the code has to use different letters. The problem's exact wording is a bit confusing here. Let me read again:\n\n\"John would make the 3-letter codes with different 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant.\"\n\nHmm, the phrase \"with different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\" might be a translation issue. Maybe it's supposed to mean that there are 5 different vowels and 20 different consonants available. So the letters are selected from those. So the code can have repeated letters unless restricted by the conditions. So the only restriction is that first and third letters (consonants) must be different. The vowel can be any of the 5, even if it's the same as one of the consonants? Wait, but vowels and consonants are different letters. Like, the letters are divided into vowels (A, E, etc.) and consonants (B, C, etc.), so a vowel can't be a consonant. So the middle vowel can be any of the 5 vowels, and the consonants can be any of the 20 consonants except that the first and third must differ.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 20 (first consonant) *5 (vowel) *19 (third consonant) = 20*5*19 = 1900. That's option E.\n\nWait but the options have E as 1900, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)1,980\n\nB)2,020\n\nC)2,100\n\nD)2,200\n\nE)1,900\n\nSo E is 1900. But why is there another option like A which is 1980? Did I miscalculate?\n\nWait perhaps the problem requires that all letters must be different. Wait the problem didn't specify that. The only conditions are:\n\n- Middle is vowel.\n\n- First and third are consonants, different from each other.\n\nBut the vowel could be the same as either consonant? Well, since vowels and consonants are separate, that's not possible. Like, if a letter is a consonant, it can't be a vowel. So the vowel is from a different set, so no overlap. So the only restriction is first and third consonants must differ.\n\nSo the calculation is correct as 20 *5 *19 = 1900. So answer is E?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the consonant counts. Let me see:\n\nWait the first consonant: 20 choices.\n\nSecond letter: 5 vowels.\n\nThird consonant: since it must be different from first, so 19.\n\nSo yes, 20 *5 *19 = 1900. So E is correct. But maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait the problem says \"the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant\". So the first and third are consonants and different from each other. The middle is a vowel. So that's exactly what I did.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem requires that all three letters must be different. But since vowels and consonants are separate, the middle vowel is a different letter (since it's a vowel) than the consonants. So even if the first and third consonants are different, the vowel could be the same as one of them? No, because vowels and consonants are different. So the total letters in the code can have duplicates only if the consonants are same, but they are required to be different. So all three letters must be different? Because the first and third are different consonants, and the vowel is a different type of letter. So all three are distinct. Wait, but the problem didn't state that. So maybe the problem allows the vowel to be the same as one of the consonants? Wait, but vowels and consonants are separate. For example, the letters 'A' is a vowel, so if the first consonant is 'B', then the vowel can be 'A', but that's allowed. The consonants are separate from vowels, so there's no overlap. So the only restriction is between first and third consonants. So the total is 20 *5 *19 =1900. So answer E. But why is there another option? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that all letters must be different. Wait the problem says \"the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other\". So that's already covered. The vowel can be same as the first consonant? Well, since vowels and consonants are different, the vowel is a different letter. So even if, for example, the first consonant is 'B', the vowel could be 'A', but there's no conflict. So the total letters can have different letters except that first and third consonants must be different. So the calculation is correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the answer is E. But the options given include E as 1900. So that's the answer. But maybe I made a mistake in the problem's conditions. Let me check again.\n\nWait the problem says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\"\u2014 perhaps that means that each code must use different letters, with 5 vowels and 20 consonants? Wait no, that might not make sense. Wait, maybe the question is in another language and the translation is off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the letters must be different. Let me re-examine the original problem's exact wording:\n\n\"John would make the 3-letter codes with different 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made?\"\n\nThe phrase \"with different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\" is a bit unclear. Maybe it's a translation error. Perhaps it's supposed to say \"using 5 different vowels and 20 different consonants\"\u2014 meaning that the available letters are 5 vowels and 20 consonants, so the total letters are 25. So each code is made by selecting letters from those, with the given conditions.\n\nIn that case, the calculation is as before. So 20 *5 *19 =1900. So answer E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that all three letters must be different. Wait, if that were the case, then even if the first and third consonants are different, but the vowel could be same as one of them? But vowels and consonants are separate. So the vowel can't be the same as the consonant. So the three letters are automatically all different because vowels and consonants are distinct sets. So the only possible duplicates would be between the consonants, but those are already required to be different. So all three letters are distinct. So in that case, the calculation is still 20 *5 *19 =1900. So that's the answer. So I think E is correct. Hmm, but why is option A 1980? Maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.\n\nWait 20 *5 is 100, 100*19 is 1900. That's right. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows the first and third consonants to be the same? Wait no, the problem says they must be different. So no. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the problem is that the consonants can be repeated except when it's the third letter. Wait, but the problem says the first and third letters must be different. So consonants are chosen from 20 each time, but subtract one for the third. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that the first and third letters must be different from each other and are both consonants. So that's exactly what I considered. So 20*5*19=1900. So E is the answer. Then why is there an option A? Maybe I missed something. Let me see another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle letter can also be a consonant? Wait no, the condition says the middle must be a vowel. So that's fixed.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the problem requires that all letters are different. But since vowels and consonants are separate, even if the vowel is the same as a consonant's letter (but they can't be). Wait, no, vowels are separate letters. So the three letters are all different. So the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm. So I think the correct answer is E)1900. So I'll go with that.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, John is making 3-letter codes with vowels and consonants. The conditions are that the middle letter must be a vowel, and the first and third letters are consonants that must be different from each other. Hmm, right. Let me parse the details again.\n\nFirst, the vowels and consonants are different. Wait, the question says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\". Wait, maybe that's just saying there are 5 different vowels and 20 different consonants available? Or does it mean that the letters used must be different? Hmm, the wording says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\". Maybe it's just the total number of vowels and consonants available. Like, there are 5 vowels (like A, E, I, O, U) and 20 consonants. So each code is made using these letters, but with certain conditions.\n\nThe code is 3 letters. The structure is consonant-vowel-consonant, but the first and third letters (the consonants) must be different. Let me think.\n\nSo the positions are:\n\n1st letter: consonant\n\n2nd letter: vowel\n\n3rd letter: consonant, which must be different from the first consonant.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFirst, choose the first consonant. There are 20 options.\n\nSecond, choose the vowel. Since there are 5 vowels, so 5 options.\n\nThird, choose the third consonant. Since it has to be different from the first consonant, so after choosing the first consonant, there are 19 left.\n\nSo the total number would be 20 (for first consonant) multiplied by 5 (vowel) multiplied by 19 (third consonant). Let me calculate that: 20 * 5 is 100, 100 *19 is 1900? Wait but wait, hold on. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, 20 * 5 is 100. 100 * 19 is indeed 1900. But looking at the options, E is 1900, but option A is 1980 and others. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\". Wait, perhaps that's a typo? Like maybe \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\" as in the letters must be different? Wait no, the wording is a bit unclear. Wait, the question says \"John would make the 3-letter codes with different 5 vowels and 20 consonants...\" Hmm, maybe that part is just stating that there are 5 vowels and 20 consonants to choose from. Like the available letters are 5 vowels and 20 consonants. So each code uses letters from those, but the letters in the code can be repeated unless restricted by the conditions. Wait, the problem says \"the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other\". So consonants first and third letters must be different. The vowel can be same as either? Wait, the problem says \"the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant\".\n\nWait the problem's exact wording is: \"the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant.\"\n\nWait, the way it's phrased might mean that the first and third letters are both consonants and must be different from each other. The middle is a vowel. So consonants for first and third, which must be different. Vowel in the middle. So vowels can be any of the 5, but are there any restrictions on vowels? Like, can the vowel be the same as the first or third consonant? Wait, probably not, because vowels and consonants are different letters. Wait, vowels are separate from consonants. So vowels and consonants are distinct sets. So the middle letter is a vowel (so from the 5), and the first and third letters are consonants (from the 20), but first and third consonants must be different.\n\nSo the calculation is indeed 20 * 5 * 19. Let's compute that again. 20 * 5 is 100, 100 *19=1900. Which is option E. But the options given include E as 1900, so that would be the answer?\n\nWait, but wait. Let me check again. Wait, maybe the problem requires that all three letters must be different? The problem says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\"\u2014 maybe that's just the available letters, not that the code has to use different letters. The problem's exact wording is a bit confusing here. Let me read again:\n\n\"John would make the 3-letter codes with different 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant.\"\n\nHmm, the phrase \"with different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\" might be a translation issue. Maybe it's supposed to mean that there are 5 different vowels and 20 different consonants available. So the letters are selected from those. So the code can have repeated letters unless restricted by the conditions. So the only restriction is that first and third letters (consonants) must be different. The vowel can be any of the 5, even if it's the same as one of the consonants? Wait, but vowels and consonants are different letters. Like, the letters are divided into vowels (A, E, etc.) and consonants (B, C, etc.), so a vowel can't be a consonant. So the middle vowel can be any of the 5 vowels, and the consonants can be any of the 20 consonants except that the first and third must differ.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 20 (first consonant) *5 (vowel) *19 (third consonant) = 20*5*19 = 1900. That's option E.\n\nWait but the options have E as 1900, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)1,980\n\nB)2,020\n\nC)2,100\n\nD)2,200\n\nE)1,900\n\nSo E is 1900. But why is there another option like A which is 1980? Did I miscalculate?\n\nWait perhaps the problem requires that all letters must be different. Wait the problem didn't specify that. The only conditions are:\n\n- Middle is vowel.\n\n- First and third are consonants, different from each other.\n\nBut the vowel could be the same as either consonant? Well, since vowels and consonants are separate, that's not possible. Like, if a letter is a consonant, it can't be a vowel. So the vowel is from a different set, so no overlap. So the only restriction is first and third consonants must differ.\n\nSo the calculation is correct as 20 *5 *19 = 1900. So answer is E?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the consonant counts. Let me see:\n\nWait the first consonant: 20 choices.\n\nSecond letter: 5 vowels.\n\nThird consonant: since it must be different from first, so 19.\n\nSo yes, 20 *5 *19 = 1900. So E is correct. But maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait the problem says \"the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant\". So the first and third are consonants and different from each other. The middle is a vowel. So that's exactly what I did.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem requires that all three letters must be different. But since vowels and consonants are separate, the middle vowel is a different letter (since it's a vowel) than the consonants. So even if the first and third consonants are different, the vowel could be the same as one of them? No, because vowels and consonants are different. So the total letters in the code can have duplicates only if the consonants are same, but they are required to be different. So all three letters must be different? Because the first and third are different consonants, and the vowel is a different type of letter. So all three are distinct. Wait, but the problem didn't state that. So maybe the problem allows the vowel to be the same as one of the consonants? Wait, but vowels and consonants are separate. For example, the letters 'A' is a vowel, so if the first consonant is 'B', then the vowel can be 'A', but that's allowed. The consonants are separate from vowels, so there's no overlap. So the only restriction is between first and third consonants. So the total is 20 *5 *19 =1900. So answer E. But why is there another option? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that all letters must be different. Wait the problem says \"the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other\". So that's already covered. The vowel can be same as the first consonant? Well, since vowels and consonants are different, the vowel is a different letter. So even if, for example, the first consonant is 'B', the vowel could be 'A', but there's no conflict. So the total letters can have different letters except that first and third consonants must be different. So the calculation is correct.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the answer is E. But the options given include E as 1900. So that's the answer. But maybe I made a mistake in the problem's conditions. Let me check again.\n\nWait the problem says \"different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\"\u2014 perhaps that means that each code must use different letters, with 5 vowels and 20 consonants? Wait no, that might not make sense. Wait, maybe the question is in another language and the translation is off. Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the letters must be different. Let me re-examine the original problem's exact wording:\n\n\"John would make the 3-letter codes with different 5 vowels and 20 consonants with the condition that the middle letter must be vowel and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonant. How many different codes can be made?\"\n\nThe phrase \"with different 5 vowels and 20 consonants\" is a bit unclear. Maybe it's a translation error. Perhaps it's supposed to say \"using 5 different vowels and 20 different consonants\"\u2014 meaning that the available letters are 5 vowels and 20 consonants, so the total letters are 25. So each code is made by selecting letters from those, with the given conditions.\n\nIn that case, the calculation is as before. So 20 *5 *19 =1900. So answer E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that all three letters must be different. Wait, if that were the case, then even if the first and third consonants are different, but the vowel could be same as one of them? But vowels and consonants are separate. So the vowel can't be the same as the consonant. So the three letters are automatically all different because vowels and consonants are distinct sets. So the only possible duplicates would be between the consonants, but those are already required to be different. So all three letters are distinct. So in that case, the calculation is still 20 *5 *19 =1900. So that's the answer. So I think E is correct. Hmm, but why is option A 1980? Maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again.\n\nWait 20 *5 is 100, 100*19 is 1900. That's right. Alternatively, maybe the problem allows the first and third consonants to be the same? Wait no, the problem says they must be different. So no. Hmm.\n\nWait maybe the problem is that the consonants can be repeated except when it's the third letter. Wait, but the problem says the first and third letters must be different. So consonants are chosen from 20 each time, but subtract one for the third. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that the first and third letters must be different from each other and are both consonants. So that's exactly what I considered. So 20*5*19=1900. So E is the answer. Then why is there an option A? Maybe I missed something. Let me see another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle letter can also be a consonant? Wait no, the condition says the middle must be a vowel. So that's fixed.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the problem requires that all letters are different. But since vowels and consonants are separate, even if the vowel is the same as a consonant's letter (but they can't be). Wait, no, vowels are separate letters. So the three letters are all different. So the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm. So I think the correct answer is E)1900. So I'll go with that.\n\n\nTo determine the number of 3-letter codes John can make under the given conditions, we break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **First Letter (Consonant):** There are 20 consonants available, so there are 20 choices.\n2. **Middle Letter (Vowel):** There are 5 vowels available, so there are 5 choices.\n3. **Third Letter (Consonant):** This must be a consonant different from the first letter. Since one consonant is already used for the first letter, there are \\(20 - 1 = 19\\) choices remaining.\n\nThe total number of codes is calculated by multiplying these choices:\n\\[\n20 \\text{ (first consonant)} \\times 5 \\text{ (vowel)} \\times 19 \\text{ (third consonant)} = 1900.\n\\]\n\nThe problem does not impose additional restrictions, such as requiring all letters to be distinct beyond the first and third consonants. Since vowels and consonants are distinct sets, there is no overlap between vowels and consonants, so no further constraints are needed. Thus, the correct answer is **1,900**.\n\nAnswer: E",
