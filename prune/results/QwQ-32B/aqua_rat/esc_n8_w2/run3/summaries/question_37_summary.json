      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch with discounts. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the marked price of the watch. The options are given, so maybe plugging in the numbers could help, but I should first understand the problem properly.\n\nAlright, the problem states that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, his profit is a certain amount. But if he gives a 7% discount instead, his profit is Rs. 15 less. The difference in profit between these two discounts is Rs. 15. So, the key here must be relating the discount percentages to the marked price and how that affects the selling price and thus the profit.\n\nLet me recall that the marked price is the original price before any discount. When a discount is given, the selling price becomes Marked Price minus the discount. The profit would then depend on the cost price. But since the problem is comparing two different discounts and their effect on profit, maybe the cost price remains the same in both scenarios. The difference in profit comes from the difference in the selling prices due to the different discounts.\n\nLet me denote the marked price as MP. \n\nFirst scenario: 5% discount. So the selling price (SP1) would be MP * (1 - 5/100) = 0.95 * MP.\n\nSecond scenario: 7% discount. Selling price (SP2) is MP * (1 - 7/100) = 0.93 * MP.\n\nThe profit in the first case is SP1 - Cost Price (CP). The profit in the second case is SP2 - CP. The difference between these two profits is Rs. 15. So,\n\nProfit1 - Profit2 = (SP1 - CP) - (SP2 - CP) = SP1 - SP2 = 0.95MP - 0.93MP = 0.02MP.\n\nBut according to the problem, this difference (Profit1 - Profit2) is equal to Rs. 15. Wait, wait. Wait, actually, when the discount increases, the profit decreases. Because selling at a lower price (higher discount) would mean less profit. So the problem says that when he gives 7% discount instead of 5%, his profit is 15 less. So the difference between the two profits is indeed 15. So Profit1 - Profit2 = 15. But according to the calculation above, SP1 - SP2 is 0.02MP, which equals 15. So 0.02 * MP = 15. Therefore, MP = 15 / 0.02. Let me calculate that. \n\n15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 multiplied by 50, since 1/0.02 is 50. 15*50 is 750. So the marked price should be 750? Wait, but let me check the options. Option D is 750. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have messed up the difference.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up the equations more formally. Let me try again.\n\nLet MP be the marked price. Let CP be the cost price. \n\nIn the first case, selling price is 0.95 MP. Profit1 = 0.95 MP - CP.\n\nSecond case: selling price is 0.93 MP. Profit2 = 0.93 MP - CP.\n\nThe problem states that Profit2 is 15 less than Profit1. So Profit1 - Profit2 = 15. \n\nSubtracting the two equations: (0.95MP - CP) - (0.93MP - CP) = 0.02 MP = 15. So yes, that's exactly what I had before. So MP = 15 /0.02 = 750. So the answer should be D) Rs.750. Hmm, but let me check the options again. Wait, option C is 787.50, D is 750. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read again. \n\nThe problem says: \"If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs.15 less as profit.\" So when he gives a higher discount (7% instead of 5%), his profit is 15 less. So yes, that's exactly the scenario I considered. The difference in selling price between 5% and 7% discount is 2% of the marked price, which leads to a 15 rupee decrease. So 2% of MP is 15, so MP is 750. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 750. So that's the answer. But wait, let me check the options again. Let me see the options again:\n\nA)697.50\n\nB)712.50\n\nC)787.50\n\nD)750\n\nE)780\n\nHmm, so D is there. But wait, maybe I need to consider that the problem is in terms of profit percentage or something else? Wait no, the problem states that the profit earned is 15 less. Since profit is (SP - CP), the difference in SP between the two scenarios is exactly the difference in profit, because the cost price is the same. So my reasoning holds. So the answer should be D.\n\nWait, but let me see if any of the other options could be correct. Let me try plugging in the numbers. Let's try option C, 787.50. Let's see:\n\nIf MP is 787.50, then 5% discount would give SP1 = 787.50 *0.95 = let's calculate that. 787.50 *0.95. 787.50 * 0.95: 787.50 - 5% of 787.50. 5% of 787.5 is 39.375. So SP1 is 787.50 - 39.375 = 748.125. \n\nThen 7% discount would be SP2 = 787.50 *0.93. Let's compute that. 787.50 - 7% of 787.50. 7% of 787.5 is 55.125. So SP2 is 787.50 -55.125 = 732.375. \n\nThe difference between SP1 and SP2 is 748.125 -732.375 = 15.75. So the difference here is 15.75. But the problem says the difference is 15. So that's not matching. So option C gives a difference of 15.75, which is more than 15, so not correct. \n\nWhat about option D: 750. \n\n5% discount: 750 *0.95 = 712.5. \n\n7% discount: 750 *0.93 = 750 - (750 *0.07). 7% of 750 is 52.5. So 750-52.5=697.5. \n\nThe difference between SP1 and SP2 is 712.5 -697.5 =15. Exactly the 15 rupees mentioned. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be D) 750. \n\nHmm, so why is option C there? Maybe someone might miscalculate. But according to this, D is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check again. The problem says when discount is increased by 2% (from 5% to7%), profit decreases by 15. The difference in selling price is 2% of MP, so 0.02*MP =15. So MP =15/0.02 =750. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n",

I need to find the marked price.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. Let's denote the marked price as MP. The difference between a 5% discount and a 7% discount is 2% of the marked price. Because when the discount increases by 2%, the profit decreases by Rs.15. So that 2% of the marked price must equal Rs.15. Wait, is that right?\n\nWait, profit is calculated as selling price minus cost price. If the discount increases, the selling price decreases, which would reduce the profit by the amount of the increased discount. But maybe the cost price remains the same, so the difference in profit is exactly the difference in the discount given. Because the cost is fixed, so the profit difference comes from the selling price difference. \n\nLet me think again. Let me write equations for this.\n\nLet the marked price be MP. Let the cost price be CP. \n\nWhen the discount is 5%, the selling price is MP*(1 - 5/100) = 0.95*MP. The profit in this case is (0.95MP - CP).\n\nWhen the discount is 7%, the selling price is 0.93*MP. The profit here is (0.93MP - CP).\n\nThe problem states that the second profit is Rs.15 less than the first. So:\n\n(0.93MP - CP) = (0.95MP - CP) - 15\n\nSimplifying this equation. Let's subtract the right-hand side from the left, but maybe better to rearrange:\n\nLeft side minus right side equals zero?\n\nWait, let's rearrange the equation:\n\n(0.93MP - CP) = (0.95MP - CP) -15\n\nSubtract (0.95MP - CP) from both sides:\n\n0.93MP - CP - 0.95MP + CP = -15\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n(0.93 - 0.95)MP = -15\n\nWhich is (-0.02)MP = -15\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: 0.02 MP =15\n\nSo MP = 15 / 0.02 = 750. Wait, that would be 15 divided by 0.02. Let me calculate that. 0.02 is 1/50, so 15 divided by (1/50) is 15*50 = 750. So the marked price is Rs.750? Then the answer would be D) Rs.750?\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option D is 750. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the equations.\n\nAlternatively, the difference between the two discounts is 2%, which is 7% -5% =2%. The difference in the selling price is 2% of MP, which leads to a decrease in profit by Rs.15. Since the cost price is the same, the difference in profit is exactly the difference in selling price. So 2% of MP equals 15. So yes, that's exactly what I did. 0.02 MP =15, so MP=750. So the answer is D?\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)697.50, B)712.50, C)787.50, D)750, E)780. So D is 750, which matches the calculation. Hmm, so that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the equations. Let me think again. Suppose the marked price is 750. Then 5% discount is 37.5, so selling price is 750 -37.5 =712.5. The profit in that case is SP - CP =712.5 - CP. \n\nWhen discount is 7%, the discount is 750 *0.07 =52.5, so SP is 750-52.5=697.5. Then profit here is 697.5 - CP. \n\nThe difference between the two profits is (712.5 - CP) - (697.5 - CP) = 15, which matches the problem statement. So yes, that works. So the answer is D. \n\nHmm, but why is option C 787.50? Maybe I did something wrong. Let me see. Let me check another way. Let me suppose that the 2% of MP is 15. So MP = 15/(0.02) =750. So that's correct. Therefore the answer should be D. So I think that's the correct choice.\n",

The options are A)697.50, B)712.50, C)787.50, D)750, E)780. So D is 750, which matches the calculation. Hmm, so that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the equations. Let me think again. Suppose the marked price is 750. Then 5% discount is 37.5, so selling price is 750 -37.5 =712.5. The profit in that case is SP - CP =712.5 - CP. \n\nWhen discount is 7%, the discount is 750 *0.07 =52.5, so SP is 750-52.5=697.5. Then profit here is 697.5 - CP. \n\nThe difference between the two profits is (712.5 - CP) - (697.5 - CP) = 15, which matches the problem statement. So yes, that works. So the answer is D. \n\nHmm, but why is option C 787.50? Maybe I did something wrong. Let me see. Let me check another way. Let me suppose that the 2% of MP is 15. So MP = 15/(0.02) =750. So that's correct. Therefore the answer should be D. So I think that's the correct choice.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the marked price (MP) of a watch where a 2% increase in discount (from 5% to 7%) reduces the profit by Rs. 15. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the cost price as CP. The selling price (SP) with a 5% discount is \\(0.95 \\times MP\\), and with a 7% discount, it is \\(0.93 \\times MP\\). The profit difference arises solely from the change in discount, as the cost price remains constant. \n\nThe equation for the profit difference is:\n\\[\n(0.93 \\times MP - CP) = (0.95 \\times MP - CP) - 15\n\\]\nSimplifying this:\n\\[\n0.93 \\times MP - 0.95 \\times MP = -15 \\implies -0.02 \\times MP = -15 \\implies MP = \\frac{15}{0.02} = 750\n\\]\n\nVerifying with MP = 750:\n- 5% discount: SP = \\(0.95 \\times 750 = 712.5\\), Profit = \\(712.5 - CP\\)\n- 7% discount: SP = \\(0.93 \\times 750 = 697.5\\), Profit = \\(697.5 - CP\\)\n- Profit difference: \\( (712.5 - CP) - (697.5 - CP) = 15 \\), which matches the problem statement.\n\nThus, the marked price is **Rs. 750**.\n\nAnswer: D",
