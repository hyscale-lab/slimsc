      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about simple interest. So Rahul borrowed 500 rupees at 6% per annum, and we need to find out how much he has to pay after 4 years. Hmm, right. I remember the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T divided by 100, maybe? Wait, let me get that straight. \n\nSo the principal amount here is 500. The rate is 6%, and the time is 4 years. The question asks for the total amount to clear the debt, which would be the principal plus the interest. Right, so first I need to calculate the interest and then add it to the principal.\n\nLet me write down the formula again. Simple Interest (SI) = (Principal \u00d7 Rate \u00d7 Time)/100. Then the total amount is Principal + SI.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: Principal is 500, rate is 6, time 4. So SI = (500 \u00d7 6 \u00d74)/100. Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst multiply 500 by 6. That's 3000. Then multiply by 4, which gives 12,000. Then divide by 100. 12,000 divided by 100 is 120. So the interest is 120. \n\nAdding that to the principal: 500 + 120 = 620. Wait, so the total amount after 4 years should be 620. Let me check the options. Option C is 620. So the answer must be C. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Let me re-calculate the interest. 500 *6 is 3000, times 4 is 12,000. Divided by 100 is indeed 120. Yeah. So total is 620. So the correct option is C. The options given include C)620. So the answer is C. But wait, let me check if I used the right formula. Because sometimes people confuse simple and compound interest. The question specifies simple interest, so yes, this is correct. So the answer should be option C.\n",

The problem is that Rahul borrowed Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest, and we need to find out how much he'll have to pay after 4 years. The options are given, but I need to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years. Then, the total amount to pay back would be the principal plus the interest, right? So the total amount A = P + I, which can also be written as A = P(1 + RT).\n\nLet me plug in the numbers here. The principal (P) is 500 rupees. The rate (R) is 6% per annum. Wait, I need to convert that percentage to a decimal. 6% is 0.06. The time (T) is 4 years.\n\nCalculating the interest first: I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me do that math. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is... 500*0.06 is 30. Because 1% of 500 is 5, so 6% is 30. Then multiply that by 4 years: 30*4 = 120. So the interest is 120 rupees.\n\nTherefore, the total amount he has to pay back is the principal plus interest: 500 + 120 = 620. Hmm, looking at the options, option C is 620. So the answer should be C?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate:\n\nPrincipal is 500. Rate 6% per year. For each year, the interest is 500 * 0.06 = 30. So over four years, that's 30 *4 = 120. Adding to principal gives 620. Yes, that's correct. The options given are A)750, B)700, C)620, D)600. So C is there. But wait, maybe I missed something? Like, is the question asking for something else?\n\nWait the question says \"clear the debt after 4 years\". So yes, that's exactly the total amount. So the answer should be C. But let me check the options again. The options include E) None of these. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait another way to compute: 6% annually simple interest. So each year's interest is 30, so after four years, total interest 120. Total amount 500+120=620. So that's correct. The options have C as 620, so that should be the answer. Therefore the correct option is C. So the answer is C.\n",
