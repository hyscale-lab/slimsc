      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round. Hmm, let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the question says five dozen toys are packed in a box. Wait, a dozen is 12, so five dozen would be 5 times 12. Let me calculate that. 5 multiplied by 12 is 60. So each box holds 60 toys. Got that part.\n\nThen, there are 98 boxes in a tempo. Oh right, so each tempo can carry 98 boxes. To find out how many toys a single tempo can carry in one round, I need to multiply the number of boxes per tempo by the number of toys per box. Let me do that: 98 boxes times 60 toys per box. Let me compute that. 98 times 60... Well, 100 times 60 is 6000, so subtract 2 times 60 which is 120. So 6000 minus 120 is 5880. So each tempo can carry 5,880 toys.\n\nNow, the total number of toys we need to lift is 29,400. The question is asking how many tempos are required to carry all of them in one round. So I guess I need to divide the total number of toys by the capacity of one tempo. Let me write that down: 29,400 divided by 5,880. \n\nHmm, let's see. Let me simplify this division. Maybe I can divide both numerator and denominator by 10 to make it easier: 2940 divided by 588. Wait, 588 times 5 is 2940, right? Let me check: 588 x5. 500x5=2500, 80x5=400, 8x5=40. Adding those gives 2500+400=2900 +40=2940. Exactly! So 5880 x5 would be 29,400. So that means 29,400 divided by 5,880 is 5. \n\nSo the answer should be 5 tempos. Let me check the options. Option B is 5. That must be the correct answer. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. \n\nLet me recalculate the toys per tempo again. 98 boxes each with 60 toys: 98*60. Let's do 98*60. 90*60 is 5400, 8*60 is 480, so 5400+480=5880. Yes, that's right. Then 29400 divided by 5880. Let me do this division again. 5880 times 5 is 29400. So yes, exactly 5. So the answer is B)5. I think that's correct. The options given are A through E, and B is 5. So I'm confident that's the right choice.\n",
