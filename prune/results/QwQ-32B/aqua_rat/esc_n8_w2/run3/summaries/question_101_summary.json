      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about ratios. Let me see... The ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4. And there are 120 green sweets. I need to find how many red sweets there are. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but let's take it step by step.\n\nAlright, ratios compare quantities. So for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. That means the ratio 3:4 is red to green. The total parts would be 3 + 4 = 7 parts, but maybe I don't need the total. Let me think. Since the number of green sweets is given, I can set up a proportion here.\n\nLet me denote the number of red sweets as R and green as G. The ratio R/G = 3/4. Wait, or is it R:G = 3:4, so R/G should equal 3/4. Right. So if G is 120, then R divided by 120 should be 3/4. So solving for R would be (3/4)*120. Let me calculate that. 3 divided by 4 is 0.75. 0.75 multiplied by 120. Let's see, 120 times 0.75. 120 times 0.7 is 84, and 120 times 0.05 is 6, so total 90. So that would be 90. So option A is 90. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the ratio as parts. The ratio parts for red is 3 and green is 4. Since green has 120, which corresponds to 4 parts. So each part is 120 divided by 4. 120/4 is 30. Then red is 3 parts, so 3 times 30 is 90. Yep, that's the same answer. So either way, the answer should be A)90. Let me check the options again. The options are A)90, B)80, C)95, D)100, E)85. So A is the first option. I think that's correct. Wait, could I have mixed up the ratio? Like red to green is 3:4, so red is less than green. Since there are 120 green, which is more than red. 90 is less than 120, so that makes sense. If I had done 4/3 instead, I might have gotten 160, which isn't even an option. So no, the correct approach is using 3/4 times the green amount. Yeah, I'm confident. The answer should be A.\n",

So maybe I can set up a proportion here. Let me think. If red is 3 parts and green is 4 parts, then the number of red sweets divided by the number of green sweets should equal 3/4. \n\nWait, the question says the ratio is red to green 3:4. So yes, that's exactly right. So, red/green = 3/4. We know the green is 120. So plugging that in, red divided by 120 equals 3/4. To find red, I can rearrange that equation. So red = (3/4)*120.

Option A is 90, so that's a possibility. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think in terms of parts. The total parts would be 3 + 4 =7, but wait, maybe that's not necessary here since we only need the red. Alternatively, since the ratio is 3:4, the number of red sweets is (3/4) times the number of green sweets, which is exactly what I did. So that seems right. \n\nAnother way to approach it: Let's say the ratio is 3:4. So for every 4 green sweets, there are 3 red. So if there are 120 green, how many groups of 4 are there in 120? 120 divided by 4 is 30. So each group has 3 red, so 30 groups would have 30 * 3 red. 30 times 3 is 90. Yep, same answer. So that's confirming it again. \n\nLooking at the options, A is 90. So I think that's the correct answer. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. The ratio is red to green, so 3:4.
