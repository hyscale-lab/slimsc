      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability question here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding P(A|B) when A and B are independent events. The probabilities given are P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8. The options are A to E, with the answer being one of those.\n\nHmm, right. I remember that when two events are independent, the occurrence of one doesn't affect the probability of the other. So, independence has something to do with conditional probabilities. Wait, what's the formula for conditional probability? Oh right, P(A|B) is equal to P(A and B) divided by P(B). But if they are independent, then P(A and B) should be P(A) times P(B), right?\n\nLet me think. Since A and B are independent, the probability of both happening is just the product of their individual probabilities. So P(A \u2229 B) = P(A) * P(B). Then, substituting that into the conditional probability formula: P(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B)] / P(B). Oh, the P(B) cancels out, so that leaves P(A|B) = P(A). So in this case, since P(A) is 0.2, the answer should be 0.2, which is option A.\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The definition of independent events is that the probability of both occurring is the product, which is exactly what I used. And the conditional probability formula, when you have independence, the condition becomes irrelevant. So knowing that B occurred doesn't change the probability of A. That makes sense. So yeah, the answer must be A) 0.2.\n",

The conditional probability P(A|B) is defined as P(A \u2229 B)/P(B). So substituting the independent case, that becomes (P(A)*P(B))/P(B) = P(A). Yep, that's right.

Like 0.4 or 0.6 would be if there was some dependence, but since they are independent, it's just 0.2. D and E are over 1, which isn't possible for a probability. So yeah, answer A.\n",
