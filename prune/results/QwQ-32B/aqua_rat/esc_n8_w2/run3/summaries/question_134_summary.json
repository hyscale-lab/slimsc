      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children. The adult fare is given as Rs. 140, and the child fare is half of that. Hmm, right, so first I need to figure out the child's fare.\n\nSo, adult fare per person is 140. Child fare is half, so that's 140 divided by 2. Let me calculate that. 140 divided by 2 is 70. So each child pays 70.\n\nNow, for 4 adults: each adult is 140, so 4 times 140. Let me do that math. 4 multiplied by 140. Let's see, 4 times 100 is 400, 4 times 40 is 160, so total 560? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 140 times 4: 100*4 is 400, 40*4 is 160, adding them gives 560. Yeah that's right. \n\nThen for the 3 children, each is 70. So 3 times 70. 70 times 3 is 210. \n\nAdding the two totals together: 560 plus 210. Let me add those. 560 + 200 is 760, then plus 10 more is 770. Wait, that would be 770? But let me check again. 560 plus 210: 500+200 is 700, 60+10 is 70, so total 770. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 770. So the answer should be E. But wait, let me check the options again. The options given are A)666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770. So yes, E is 770. Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me re-calculate each step once more.\n\nAdult fare: 140 each. 4 adults: 140 *4 = 560. Correct. Child is half of 140, which is 70. Three children: 3*70=210. 560+210=770. So that's E. The options list E as 770. So the answer must be E. I don't see any errors here. The possible trap might be if someone thought the child's fare is half of the total, but no, the question clearly states \"child is half the fare of one adult\". So yeah, I think E is correct.\n",

The child's fare is half of that. I need to find the total fare for 4 adults and 3 children. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the adult fare is straightforward. Each adult pays 140. So for 4 adults, that's 4 multiplied by 140. Let me calculate that. 4 times 100 is 400, and 4 times 40 is 160. Adding those together gives 560. So 4 adults would be Rs. 560.\n\nNow for the children. The child fare is half the adult fare. Since the adult is 140, half of that would be 70. So each child pays 70. Then, 3 children would be 3 times 70. Let me do that math. 3 times 70 is 210. \n\nNow, adding the adult total and the child total together. 560 plus 210. Let me add those numbers. 500 + 200 is 700, and 60 +10 is 70. So total is 700 +70 = 770? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 560 plus 210. Let me check again. 560 + 200 is 760, plus 10 more is 770. Hmm, but looking at the options, option C is 700 and E is 770. So which is it?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the math. \n\nAdults: 4 x 140. Let's compute 140 x4. 140 x 4 is 560. That's correct. \n\nChildren: 3 x (140/2) = 3 x70 =210. Correct. \n\nTotal: 560 +210 = 770. So the answer should be E) 770. \n\nLooking at the options, option E is 770. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A) 666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770. Yes, so E is the correct one. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option C as 700? Maybe I did something wrong here. Wait, perhaps the question says \"child is half the fare of one adult\". So yes, that's correct. So the calculation is right. So the answer must be E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the question's wording? Let me read again. \"The bus fare of one adult is Rs. 140... child is half the fare of one adult between the same places.\" So yes, same places, so the child is 70. \n\nSo adding up 4 adults (560) and 3 children (210) gives 770.
