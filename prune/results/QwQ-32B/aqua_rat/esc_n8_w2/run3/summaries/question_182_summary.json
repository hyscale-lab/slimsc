      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Fernando has this meal plan where he can have 3 lunches and 3 dinners a week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, and he goes home for dinner on Fridays. Hmm, I need to figure out how many ways he can allocate his meals. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's clarify the days involved. Since the cafeteria is closed on weekends (Saturday and Sunday), the week here probably refers to Monday through Friday. But wait, Friday is a school day except for dinner. The problem says he goes home for dinner on Friday nights, so that means he can't have dinner at the cafeteria on Friday. So the dinners available are only from Monday to Thursday, right? Wait, no\u2014Friday is part of the week but the dinner that day he can't use. So total dinners allowed per week are 3, but he can't use Friday's dinner. So he has to choose his 3 dinners from the other days. Let me see.\n\nLet me break it down. The week has 5 days (Monday to Friday), but for dinners, Friday's is excluded. So for dinners, the available days are Monday to Thursday (4 days). Because he can't use Friday's dinner. So he has to choose 3 dinners from those 4 days? Wait, but each day has one dinner. So he can have up to one dinner per day, except Friday. So the number of possible days for dinners is 4 (Mon-Thu), and he needs to choose 3 of those days to use his dinners. That would be 4 choose 3, right?\n\nThen for lunches. The cafeteria is open all weekdays, so lunches are available Monday to Friday (5 days). He can have up to 3 lunches. Wait, but the problem says he has a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. So he must use exactly 3 lunches and exactly 3 dinners. So for lunches, he needs to choose 3 days out of the 5 days (Mon-Fri) to have lunch. Because each lunch is one per day. So that would be 5 choose 3.\n\nSo the total options would be the combination of lunches multiplied by dinners. So lunches: 5C3, dinners: 4C3. So looking at the options, that would be option A: 5C3 multiplied by 4C3. Wait, but let me check the options again.\n\nWait the options are given as:\n\nA)5C3*4C3\n\nB)5C4*4C2\n\nC)5C2*4C4\n\nD)5C6*4C5\n\nE)4C3*4C3\n\nHmm, so option A matches what I thought. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the problem again. The question says he can have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so the week here is Monday-Friday. But he can't have dinner on Friday because he goes home. So for dinners, each day from Monday to Thursday has a possible dinner, but Friday's is not available. Therefore, he has to choose 3 dinners out of the 4 possible days (Mon-Thu). That's correct, so 4C3 for dinners.\n\nFor lunches, he can have them any day from Monday to Friday, so 5 days. He needs to choose 3 days to have lunch. So that's 5 choose 3, which is 5C3. So multiplying those gives 5C3 *4C3, which is option A. But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option A is exactly that. But wait, wait a second, maybe I messed up the days for lunches?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he must have exactly three lunches and three dinners, but each day can have at most one lunch and one dinner. So for each day, except Friday dinner, he can choose to use a meal or not, but he must exactly reach 3 lunches and 3 dinners. So the problem is about selecting days for lunches and dinners, considering the constraints.\n\nWait, let me think again. For lunches, each day (Mon-Fri) can have a lunch or not. He needs to choose exactly 3 days to have lunch. So that's 5 choose 3. For dinners, he can have dinners on Mon-Thu (since Fri is excluded), so 4 days. He needs to choose 3 of those 4 days. So 4 choose 3. So yes, 5C3 *4C3, which is option A. So that would be the answer. But wait, the options given include A as that. But wait, the options given in the problem are the options. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait the options are:\n\nA)5C3*4C3\n\nB)5C4*4C2\n\nC)5C2*4C4\n\nD)5C6*4C5\n\nE)4C3*4C3\n\nYes, so option A is exactly that. So why would the answer not be A? Wait but maybe I made a mistake in the days?\n\nWait another thought: the problem says he can have a total of 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. So the total is exactly 3 lunches and exactly 3 dinners. So for lunches, he has 5 days (Mon-Fri) to choose 3 days. For dinners, he has 4 days (Mon-Thu) to choose 3 days. So the calculation is correct. So A is the answer.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Let me see if any other option could be possible. Let me check option E: 4C3*4C3. That would be if both lunches and dinners had 4 days. But lunches are 5 days. So no. Option B is 5C4 (so 4 lunches?) multiplied by 4C2 (2 dinners). But the problem requires exactly 3 each. So that's not right. So yes, A must be correct. \n\nWait but maybe I made a mistake in the days for lunches. Wait, the problem says the cafeteria is closed on weekends, so lunches and dinners are only available on weekdays. But for Friday's dinner, he can't have it. So for lunches, all five days (Mon-Fri) are available. So choosing 3 days for lunch: 5C3. Dinners: 4 days (Mon-Thu), choose 3:4C3. So the product is A. So the answer is A. But I recall sometimes these problems can have a twist. Wait, perhaps the problem is that he must use exactly three lunches and three dinners, but can't have more than one per day. So yeah, the way I thought. So the correct answer is A. Hmm. But let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the total number of meals is 3 lunches and 3 dinners. So he can choose any combination as long as the total lunches are 3 and dinners 3, but considering the constraints on Friday's dinner. So that's exactly what I considered. So yes, A is correct. \n\nWait but let me think again. Let me see the options again. The first option is 5C3 *4C3. That's exactly what I got. So I think that is correct. So the answer should be A. But wait the options given in the problem include A as the first option. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in counting the days for the dinners. Let me confirm: \n\nFernando can't have dinner on Friday. So the possible days for dinners are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. That's four days. He needs to choose 3 of those four days to have his dinners. So 4 choose 3. That's right. So yes, the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the question is about how he can allocate his meals across the days, but perhaps the order matters? No, because choosing days is a combination. So I think A is correct. So the correct answer is A.\n",
