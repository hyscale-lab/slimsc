      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about figuring out the percentage more the appliance was sold for compared to its wholesale cost. Let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nSo, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. Then it was sold for 20% less than that original retail price. I need to find out what percentage more than the wholesale cost this selling price is. Alright, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, maybe I should assign a variable to the wholesale cost to make it easier. Let's say the wholesale cost is W. Then, the original retail price is 60% more than W. To calculate that, 60% of W is 0.6*W, so the original retail price (let's call it R) would be W + 0.6W = 1.6W. Got that part.\n\nNow, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So the selling price S is 20% off of R. To find that, 20% of R is 0.2*R, so subtract that from R: S = R - 0.2R = 0.8R. Since R is 1.6W, substituting that in, S would be 0.8 * 1.6W. Let me compute that: 0.8 times 1.6. \n\nHmm, 1.6 times 0.8. Let's see, 1.6 * 0.8 is the same as (1 + 0.6) * 0.8 = 0.8 + 0.48 = 1.28. Wait, so 0.8*1.6 is 1.28? Let me check that again. 1.6 multiplied by 0.8: 1.6 * 0.8 = 1.28. Yes, that's correct. So S is 1.28 times W. \n\nSo the selling price is 1.28W. The question is, how much more is this compared to the wholesale cost? The wholesale cost is W, so the difference is 1.28W - W = 0.28W. So that's a 28% increase over the wholesale cost. Therefore, the answer should be B)28%. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through the steps again. \n\nOriginal retail price is 60% more than wholesale. So if W is 100, then R would be 160. Then, selling at 20% less than R: 20% of 160 is 32, so 160 -32 =128. So selling price is 128. The wholesale was 100, so 128 is 28 more than 100, which is 28%. Yep, that checks out. So the answer must be B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try another example with different numbers to confirm. Let's say the wholesale cost is $200. Then the original retail price is 200 + 60% of 200 = 200*1.6 = 320. Then, selling at 20% less than 320 would be 320 * 0.8 = 256. The wholesale is 200, so 256-200 is 56. 56 is what percent of 200? 56/200 = 0.28 \u2192 28%. Yep, same result. So definitely B.\n",

Let me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. So, if I let the wholesale cost be some number, maybe I can pick a value to make the math easier. Like, let's say the wholesale cost is $100. That might make calculations straightforward. \n\nSo, if the wholesale cost (let's call it W) is $100, then the original retail price (R) would be 60% more. 60% of 100 is 60, so R would be 100 + 60 = $160. Got that part.\n\nNow, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. Oh right, so the selling price (S) is 20% off of R. Let me calculate that. 20% of 160 is... 0.2 * 160 = 32. So subtracting that from 160 gives 160 - 32 = $128. \n\nSo the selling price is $128. Now the question is, what's this amount compared to the wholesale cost? The wholesale was $100, so the selling price is 128 compared to 100. To find the percentage more than the wholesale cost, I think I subtract the original 100, so 28 over 100, which is 28%. Wait, that would be option B. But let me double-check because sometimes these problems can trick you.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should do it with variables instead of numbers to confirm. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet W be the wholesale cost. Then original retail price R is W + 60% of W, which is R = W * 1.60. Then the selling price S is 20% less than R, so that's R minus 20% of R. Which would be S = R * 0.80. Substituting R gives S = 1.60W * 0.80 = 1.28W. \n\nAh, so S is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. That means it's 28% more than W. So that's 28%, which is option B. Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)20, B)28, C)36, D)40, E)42. So yes, B is there. \n\nHmm, but wait another thought. Did I interpret the question correctly? The question asks \"sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost?\" So yes, since the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale, that's 28% more. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that 60% increase then 20% decrease would be 60 -20 =40? But that's not how percentages work. Because the 20% is off the already increased price. So the correct way is indeed to multiply the factors. \n\nSo yeah, I think B is correct. Let me just confirm with another example. Let's take W as $50. Then R would be 50*1.6=80. Then selling at 20% less: 80 *0.8 =64. So 64 compared to 50. 64/50 is 1.28, so 28% more. Yep, same result. \n\nSo the answer should be B)28%.\n",
