      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so the question is about the ages of Q, R, and T. Let me read it again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. The sum of R and T's ages is 50 years. We need to find the definite difference between R and Q's age. The options are given, and I have to choose the correct one. \n\nAlright, let's break this down. Let me assign variables to each person's age. Let me denote Q's age as Q, R's age as R, and T's age as T. \n\nThe first part says Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. That wording is a bit tricky. Let me parse that. \"Q is younger than R by some amount, and that same amount is how much older Q is than T.\" So the difference between R and Q's age is the same as the difference between Q and T's age. \n\nSo, mathematically, that should translate to R - Q = Q - T. Because the amount R is older than Q is equal to the amount Q is older than T. Let me write that equation down:\n\nR - Q = Q - T.\n\nThen, the second piece of information is that the sum of R and T's ages is 50. So R + T = 50.\n\nWe need to find the difference between R and Q's age. Wait, the question says \"the difference between R and Q's age.\" Well, that's exactly R - Q, right? Because R is older than Q, so the difference is R - Q. But let's see if we can find that value with the given info.\n\nSo let's work with the equations. Let me see. We have two equations here:\n\n1) R - Q = Q - T. Let's rearrange that equation. Let's add Q and T to both sides, and subtract the other terms. Let's see, R + T = 2Q. Because if I take R - Q = Q - T, then adding Q and T to both sides gives R + T = 2Q. \n\nWait, that's exactly what I just thought. So R + T = 2Q. \n\nBut the second equation given is R + T = 50. Wait, that would mean that 2Q = 50, so Q's age is 25. Because substituting R + T from the second equation into the first equation's rearrangement gives 50 = 2Q, so Q is 25. \n\nNow, the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age, which is R - Q. Since Q is 25, then R - 25 = (Q's age difference with R). But how do we find R's age?\n\nAlternatively, since R + T =50 and R - Q = Q - T, and we found Q is 25. Let's see. Let me plug Q=25 into the first equation. So R -25 = 25 - T. \n\nBut since R + T =50, then T =50 - R. Substitute that into the equation R -25 =25 - (50 - R). Let's do that:\n\nR -25 =25 -50 + R. Wait, that would be R -25 = R -25. Hmm, that simplifies to R -25 = R -25, which is an identity. That means that the equations are dependent, so we can't find unique values for R and T. \n\nSo even though we know Q is 25, R can be any value such that T is 50 - R. Then the difference R - Q would be R -25, but since R can vary as long as T is 50-R, the difference between R and Q can be any value as long as T is adjusted accordingly. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let's say Q is 25. So R's age must be greater than 25 (since Q is younger than R), and T's age must be less than 25 (since Q is older than T). The sum R + T is 50, so R must be 25 + x and T must be 25 - x, where x is the difference. Wait, that's exactly the setup here. \n\nLet me let the difference between R and Q be x. So R = Q + x. Then, since the difference between Q and T is also x, T = Q - x. \n\nAdding R and T together: R + T = (Q + x) + (Q - x) = 2Q. Which matches the earlier equation. \n\nWe know R + T =50, so 2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25. Then R =25 +x and T=25 -x. \n\nThe difference between R and Q is x. But the problem is that x can be any positive number as long as T is positive (since age can't be negative). For instance, if x is 5, then R is 30 and T is 20. The difference R-Q is 5. But if x is 10, then R is 35, T is 15, so the difference is 10. \n\nSo unless there's a constraint on the possible values of x, like T must be at least, say, 1 year old, but the problem doesn't state that. So technically, x could be up to 25, making T zero, but since age can't be negative, the maximum x can be is 25 (so T=0, but maybe that's not allowed). But the problem doesn't specify minimum ages, so strictly speaking, we can't determine the exact value of x. \n\nTherefore, the difference between R and Q's age (which is x) can't be determined from the given information. So the answer should be D) Cannot be determined. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T\". So the difference has to be a positive number. So x has to be positive. But since R + T =50 and Q is 25, but without more info, like maybe the current year or another condition, we can't find x. \n\nSo yes, the correct answer should be D. Let me check the options again. The options are A)22, B)27, C)29, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of the above. \n\nHmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, when they say \"the difference between R and Q's age\", that's R - Q, which is x. But from the equations, all we can say is that R + T =50, and R - Q = Q - T. Which gives us that Q is 25, but the difference R-Q is x, which can be any value as long as T is 25 -x. So unless there is a constraint that T has to be a positive age, then x must be less than 25. But even then, the problem doesn't give any other info. So the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me see. The question is \"What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\" If the problem is from a standard test, sometimes there might be a trick. Wait, but according to the equations, the difference R-Q is equal to Q-T. So R-Q = Q-T. So R - Q = (R + T)/2 - T? Wait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the equations again. Since R - Q = Q - T, then R + T = 2Q. And R + T =50, so 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25. Then, R -25 =25 - T. But since R =50 - T, substituting that in: (50 - T) -25 =25 - T \u2192 25 - T =25 - T. Which is always true, so there's infinite solutions. \n\nTherefore, the difference between R and Q is R -25, which can be any value as long as R is between 25 and 50 (since T has to be at least 0). So for example, if R is 30, difference is 5. If R is 40, difference is 15. So the difference isn't fixed. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be D) Cannot be determined. \n\nWait but the options include E) None of the above. Wait, but the options given are A to E, and D is \"Cannot be determined\". So the correct answer should be D. So the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So the difference between R and Q is equal to the difference between Q and T. So R - Q = Q - T. Therefore, R + T = 2Q. And R + T =50, so 2Q=50 \u2192 Q=25. \n\nThus, R -25 =25 - T. Since R =50 - T, substituting R into the first equation gives (50 - T) -25 =25 - T \u2192 25 - T =25 - T. So that's an identity. So there are infinitely many solutions. \n\nThus, R can be any value between (just above)25 and 50, making the difference R-Q vary between 0 and 25. Since the problem asks for \"definitely the difference\", which must be a fixed number, but since it can be any value between 0 and 25 (assuming T can be as low as 0), then the difference isn't determined. \n\nSo the answer must be D. \n\nHmm, so the options are D and E. The question says \"definitely the difference\". Since it can't be determined, D is the right choice. So yeah, I think D is correct.\n",

Because the problem states \"What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\" Since it can be any value (like 5, 15, etc.), we can't determine it from the given info. So the answer is D.\n\n\nThe problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T, leading to the equation \\( R - Q = Q - T \\). This simplifies to \\( R + T = 2Q \\). Additionally, we know \\( R + T = 50 \\). Combining these gives \\( 2Q = 50 \\), so \\( Q = 25 \\). \n\nHowever, the difference \\( R - Q \\) depends on the specific values of R and T. For instance:\n- If \\( R = 30 \\), then \\( T = 20 \\), making \\( R - Q = 5 \\).\n- If \\( R = 40 \\), then \\( T = 10 \\), making \\( R - Q = 15 \\).\n\nSince multiple valid age combinations exist, the exact difference between R and Q cannot be determined with the given information. The correct answer is **D) Cannot be determined**.\n\nAnswer: D",
