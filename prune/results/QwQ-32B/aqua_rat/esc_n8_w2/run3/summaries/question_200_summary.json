      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014who each answer a question on an exam. Each has different probabilities of getting it right. The question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. The options are given, and I need to choose the correct one.\n\nFirst, let me break down the information given:\n\n- Alan is guessing randomly, so his probability of a correct answer is 1/5. Since he's guessing, I assume that's considered not cheating.\n- Roger is cheating by looking at someone else's paper, so his probability of being correct is 2/3. Since he's cheating, any correct answer from him would count as cheating, so we need to exclude his correct answers from the desired probability.\n- Peter is doing the calculations properly, so his correct answer probability is 5/6. Since he's not cheating, his correct answers are part of what we want.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" Wait, but each of the three friends is answering the question. Does that mean that exactly one of them is answering the question, or are all three answering and we need the probability that at least one of them got it right without cheating? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous here. Let me think.\n\nThe question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So perhaps it's considering that one of the three is the one who answered it, and we need the probability that that person answered correctly without cheating. But how exactly are they attempting the question? Are they each answering independently, and we want the probability that at least one of them answered correctly without cheating? Or is it that exactly one of them is the one who answered the question, and we need the probability that their method wasn't cheating but they got it right?\n\nHmm, the problem statement might be a bit unclear. Let me read again.\n\n\"Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam.\" So each of them is attempting the question. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Wait, maybe it's that exactly one of them answered it, and we want the probability that that answer was correct and not obtained by cheating. Or perhaps the question is asking for the probability that at least one of them answered correctly, but none of the correct answers were due to cheating. Wait, but the wording is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly, and that none of them cheated in doing so. Wait, but Roger is cheating. So if Roger answered correctly, then that would be via cheating. So the desired probability is that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but Roger did not, but also considering that maybe more than one of them could have answered correctly. Wait, perhaps the question is considering that each of them answered the question, and the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one of them, but that the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. Wait, but how to interpret this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone (either of them) but that the correct answer was not achieved through cheating. That would mean that either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. But perhaps the question is considering that exactly one of them answered the question, but that's not stated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that the correct answer was not via cheating. But that might not be the case either. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased such that each of the three friends is attempting the question, and we want the probability that the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, but that the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. In other words, the correct answer must have come from either Alan (who's guessing) or Peter (who does calculations), but not from Roger (since he cheated). But since the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, perhaps it's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. Because if Roger answered correctly, that would be cheating, so we have to exclude cases where Roger is correct. Wait, but maybe even if Roger is correct, but another one is also correct, but the question says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\"\u2014does that mean that the correct answer must not involve cheating at all? Or that the correct answer is from a non-cheating method?\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that the correct answer was from a non-cheating method. Or perhaps it's the probability that the answer given (assuming they each have their own answers) is correct, but that the method used wasn't cheating. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one of them, but none of the correct answers were obtained through cheating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as each of them attempting the question, and the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one of them, and that the correct answer was not obtained via cheating (i.e., that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that exactly one of them answered the question, and we want the probability that that person's answer was correct and wasn't cheating. But then we need to know the probability that each of them was the one chosen to answer, but the problem doesn't specify that. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to parse the question again:\n\n\"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\"\n\nThe wording suggests that the question is being answered by someone, and the method wasn't cheating. So, perhaps the scenario is that one of the three answered the question, and we need the probability that their answer was correct and they didn't cheat. But how is the selection of who answers determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe all three are answering the question independently, and the question is asking for the probability that at least one of them answered correctly, and that none of the correct answers were due to cheating. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that exactly one of the three answered the question, but the problem doesn't specify which one. Wait, maybe each of them is answering the same question, and the question is asking for the probability that at least one of them answered correctly, and that the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So, in that case, the correct answer could come from Alan (1/5 chance) or Peter (5/6), but not from Roger (since Roger cheated). So the total probability would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not answer correctly. \n\nWait, but if Roger answered correctly, then even if others did, that would count as cheating, so we have to exclude all scenarios where Roger's answer is correct. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the correct answer must have been achieved without cheating, so any correct answer from Roger is excluded. So the event is that the answer is correct, but it's not Roger's answer (since he cheated). Wait, but maybe the question is that the correct answer was obtained by someone who didn't cheat, so the answer is correct and it's either Alan or Peter who got it right, and we want the probability that at least one of them got it right, and Roger didn't. Because if Roger got it right, that's cheating, so even if another did, the presence of Roger's correct answer via cheating would disqualify the \"not via cheating\" part.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Let me think of it this way:\n\nThe question wants the probability that the question was answered correctly, but the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. Since Roger cheated, any correct answer from him would be considered cheating. Therefore, the only valid correct answers are from Alan or Peter. \n\nHowever, the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So perhaps the correct answer is obtained through non-cheating methods. So, the scenario must be that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger answered correctly, even if others did, that correct answer via cheating would mean that the answer was via cheating, so the entire event is not desired.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is considered to be \"not via cheating\" as long as at least one non-cheater got it right, even if a cheater also did. But the wording says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\", so maybe it's the case that the correct answer must not have been obtained via cheating, so any correct answer that is due to cheating is excluded. Therefore, the correct answer must have come from a non-cheater (Alan or Peter) and not from Roger. \n\nTherefore, the event we are interested in is that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly AND Roger did NOT answer correctly. \n\nWait, but even if both Alan and Peter answered correctly, as long as Roger didn't, that would still be acceptable. So, the probability would be:\n\nP( (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect )\n\nWhich can be written as P( (A \u222a P) \u2229 R^c )\n\nAlternatively, using probability rules, that's equal to P(A \u222a P) * P(R^c) ?\n\nWait no, because the events are independent, right? Because each of them is attempting the question independently. So Alan's answer, Roger's answer, and Peter's answer are independent events. So, the probability that Roger didn't get it right is (1 - 2/3) = 1/3. The probability that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right is 1 - P(neither Alan nor Peter got it right). \n\nSo let me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, the probability that Roger didn't answer correctly is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nThe probability that Alan did not answer correctly is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.\n\nThe probability that Peter did not answer correctly is 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.\n\nThe probability that both Alan and Peter didn't answer correctly is (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/(30) = 2/15.\n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nTherefore, the combined probability that Roger didn't answer correctly AND at least one of Alan or Peter did is (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45. Wait, but that's one of the options (E). Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the events are independent, so the total probability is the product of the probabilities of each part. Wait, but the way I broke it down is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-calculate:\n\nProbability that Roger is incorrect: 1/3.\n\nProbability that Alan is correct OR Peter is correct:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P) (since independent)\n\nWait, since their answers are independent, the probability that at least one is correct is 1 - P(not A and not P).\n\nYes, that's better. So P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - [ (4/5)*(1/6) ] = 1 - (4/30) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nTherefore, the combined probability is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45. Which is option E. \n\nBut let me think again. Wait, the problem says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\".\n\nWait, perhaps another interpretation: the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, and that the correct answer was not obtained via cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from Alan or Peter, but not Roger. However, if both Peter and Alan got it right, that's still okay. But if Roger also got it right, then the answer was obtained via cheating, so that's excluded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the question is considered as answered correctly if at least one of them got it right, but the method used must not be cheating. So, even if one of them cheated and got it right, but another didn't cheat and got it right, then the answer is still considered as correct but not via cheating? Or does the presence of a cheating method disqualify it?\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous here. Let me think of possible interpretations.\n\nThe problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". The \"but not via cheating\" might mean that the correct answer must not have been obtained through cheating. So, even if someone else cheated and got it right, but another non-cheater also got it right, then the answer is considered correct but not via cheating. Wait, but maybe the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer was obtained without cheating, meaning that at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) got it right, and Roger didn't. Because if Roger did get it right, even if others did, then there was cheating involved, so the correct answer is considered as via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the question is answered by one of them, and we want the probability that that person's answer was correct and they didn't cheat. But the problem doesn't state that only one of them is answering, so that's probably not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that person didn't cheat. But that's a different scenario. The wording isn't clear on this. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by a non-cheater. So, the correct answer must have been provided by someone who didn't cheat, regardless of others. But in that case, if both Alan and Peter got it right, that's still okay. If Roger got it right and Peter also did, then the presence of Roger's cheating answer would mean that the answer was via cheating, so that scenario is excluded.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nThe total probability that the question was answered correctly via non-cheating is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. Because if Roger answered correctly, then even if others did, the answer was obtained via cheating (since Roger cheated), so the entire scenario is excluded. So the correct calculation would be as I did before: 13/45, which is option E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach is to compute all possible correct answers without cheating. So the only valid correct answers are from Alan or Peter. So the probability that at least one of them is correct and Roger is wrong. That's exactly what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the probability that the answer was correct and the method wasn't cheating. So the method must be either Alan's guess or Peter's calculation. So, the correct answer must have come from a non-cheater, so the correct answer is only counted if at least one non-cheater got it right and Roger didn't. That's the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nHmm, so 13/45 is option E. But let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nCalculations step by step:\n\nProbability Roger is incorrect: 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nProbability that Alan is correct: 1/5. Peter's correct: 5/6. \n\nProbability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct:\n\n1 - (probability both incorrect)\n\nAlan incorrect: 4/5. Peter incorrect: 1/6.\n\nMultiply those: (4/5)(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15.\n\nThus 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nMultiply by Roger's incorrect: (1/3)*(13/15) = 13/(3*15) = 13/45. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me consider another angle. What if the question is interpreted as the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one was a non-cheater. But that would be different. Let's see.\n\nIn that case, we would have to consider three scenarios:\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger wrong, Peter wrong.\n\n2. Peter correct, Alan wrong, Roger wrong.\n\n3. Roger correct, but then that's cheating, so exclude.\n\nWait, but if the question requires that exactly one answered correctly and that one wasn't cheating, then the total would be the sum of the first two scenarios.\n\nAlan's case: (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6) = (1/5)(1/3)(1/6) = 1/(90).\n\nPeter's case: (5/6)*(1 - 1/5)*(1 - 2/3) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if Peter is correct, Alan is wrong, and Roger is wrong.\n\nSo:\n\nPeter correct:5/6, Alan wrong:4/5, Roger wrong:1/3.\n\nMultiply those: (5/6)(4/5)(1/3) = (20/90) = 2/9.\n\nAdding the two scenarios: 1/90 + 2/9 = (1 + 20)/90 = 21/90 = 7/30. But that's not one of the options. So that's probably not the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one non-cheater, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. Wait, but then the \"but not via cheating\" would mean that the answer is correct and at least one non-cheater got it right, but even if Roger also did, but since Roger cheated, then the presence of Roger's correct answer would mean that the answer was via cheating. Hmm, so that complicates it.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, so the only way that can happen is if at least one non-cheater got it right and Roger did not. Because if Roger did get it right, even if others did too, then cheating was involved, so the answer was obtained via cheating. Therefore, the correct calculation is indeed 13/45, which is E. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating, we need to consider the contributions of Alan and Peter (who do not cheat) while ensuring Roger (who cheats) does not answer correctly. \n\n1. **Probability Roger answers incorrectly**:  \n   Roger's chance of being wrong is \\(1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Probability at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly**:  \n   Calculate the probability that neither Alan nor Peter is correct and subtract from 1:  \n   - Alan incorrect: \\(1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}\\).  \n   - Peter incorrect: \\(1 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).  \n   - Both incorrect: \\(\\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15}\\).  \n   - At least one correct: \\(1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}\\).\n\n3. **Combine the probabilities**:  \n   The total probability is the product of Roger being incorrect and at least one non-cheater being correct:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{13}{15} = \\frac{13}{45}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",

Because each of them is attempting the question independently. So Alan's answer, Roger's answer, and Peter's answer are independent events. So, the probability that Roger didn't get it right is (1 - 2/3) = 1/3.

Wait, but that's one of the options (E). Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nWait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the events are independent, so the total probability is the product of the probabilities of each part. Wait, but the way I broke it down is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-calculate:\n\nProbability that Roger is incorrect: 1/3.\n\nProbability that Alan is correct OR Peter is correct:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) = P(A) + P(P) - P(A)P(P) (since independent)\n\nWait, since their answers are independent, the probability that at least one is correct is 1 - P(not A and not P).\n\nYes, that's better. So P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - [ (4/5)*(1/6) ] = 1 - (4/30) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nTherefore, the combined probability is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/45. Which is option E. \n\nBut let me think again. Wait, the problem says \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\".\n\nWait, perhaps another interpretation: the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, and that the correct answer was not obtained via cheating. So, the correct answer could have come from Alan or Peter, but not Roger. However, if both Peter and Alan got it right, that's still okay. But if Roger also got it right, then the answer was obtained via cheating, so that's excluded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the question is considered as answered correctly if at least one of them got it right, but the method used must not be cheating. So, even if one of them cheated and got it right, but another didn't cheat and got it right, then the answer is still considered as correct but not via cheating? Or does the presence of a cheating method disqualify it?\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous here. Let me think of possible interpretations.\n\nThe problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". The \"but not via cheating\" might mean that the correct answer must not have been obtained through cheating. So, even if someone else cheated and got it right, but another non-cheater also got it right, then the answer is considered correct but not via cheating. Wait, but maybe the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer was obtained without cheating, meaning that at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) got it right, and Roger didn't. Because if Roger did get it right, even if others did, then there was cheating involved, so the correct answer is considered as via cheating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the question is answered by one of them, and we want the probability that that person's answer was correct and they didn't cheat. But the problem doesn't state that only one of them is answering, so that's probably not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that person didn't cheat. But that's a different scenario. The wording isn't clear on this. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by a non-cheater. So, the correct answer must have been provided by someone who didn't cheat, regardless of others. But in that case, if both Alan and Peter got it right, that's still okay. If Roger got it right and Peter also did, then the presence of Roger's cheating answer would mean that the answer was via cheating, so that scenario is excluded.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nThe total probability that the question was answered correctly via non-cheating is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. Because if Roger answered correctly, then even if others did, the answer was obtained via cheating (since Roger cheated), so the entire scenario is excluded. So the correct calculation would be as I did before: 13/45, which is option E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach is to compute all possible correct answers without cheating. So the only valid correct answers are from Alan or Peter. So the probability that at least one of them is correct and Roger is wrong. That's exactly what I did before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem wants the probability that the answer was correct and the method wasn't cheating. So the method must be either Alan's guess or Peter's calculation. So, the correct answer must have come from a non-cheater, so the correct answer is only counted if at least one non-cheater got it right and Roger didn't. That's the same as before.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 13/45, which is option E.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nHmm, so 13/45 is option E. But let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nCalculations step by step:\n\nProbability Roger is incorrect: 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nProbability that Alan is correct: 1/5. Peter's correct: 5/6. \n\nProbability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct:\n\n1 - (probability both incorrect)\n\nAlan incorrect: 4/5. Peter incorrect: 1/6.\n\nMultiply those: (4/5)(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15.\n\nThus 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nMultiply by Roger's incorrect: (1/3)*(13/15) = 13/(3*15) = 13/45. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me consider another angle. What if the question is interpreted as the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one was a non-cheater. But that would be different. Let's see.\n\nIn that case, we would have to consider three scenarios:\n\n1. Alan correct, Roger wrong, Peter wrong.\n\n2. Peter correct, Alan wrong, Roger wrong.\n\n3. Roger correct, but then that's cheating, so exclude.\n\nWait, but if the question requires that exactly one answered correctly and that one wasn't cheating, then the total would be the sum of the first two scenarios.\n\nAlan's case: (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 - 5/6) = (1/5)(1/3)(1/6) = 1/(90).\n\nPeter's case: (5/6)*(1 - 1/5)*(1 - 2/3) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, if Peter is correct, Alan is wrong, and Roger is wrong.\n\nSo:\n\nPeter correct:5/6, Alan wrong:4/5, Roger wrong:1/3.\n\nMultiply those: (5/6)(4/5)(1/3) = (20/90) = 2/9.\n\nAdding the two scenarios: 1/90 + 2/9 = (1 + 20)/90 = 21/90 = 7/30. But that's not one of the options. So that's probably not the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one non-cheater, regardless of whether Roger also got it right. Wait, but then the \"but not via cheating\" would mean that the answer is correct and at least one non-cheater got it right, but even if Roger also did, but since Roger cheated, then the presence of Roger's correct answer would mean that the answer was via cheating. Hmm, so that complicates it.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, so the only way that can happen is if at least one non-cheater got it right and Roger did not. Because if Roger did get it right, even if others did too, then cheating was involved, so the answer was obtained via cheating. Therefore, the correct calculation is indeed 13/45, which is E. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating, we need to consider the contributions of Alan and Peter (who do not cheat) while ensuring Roger (who cheats) does not answer correctly. \n\n1. **Probability Roger answers incorrectly**:  \n   Roger's chance of being wrong is \\(1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Probability at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly**:  \n   Calculate the probability that neither Alan nor Peter is correct and subtract from 1:  \n   - Alan incorrect: \\(1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}\\).  \n   - Peter incorrect: \\(1 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).  \n   - Both incorrect: \\(\\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15}\\).  \n   - At least one correct: \\(1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}\\).\n\n3. **Combine the probabilities**:  \n   The total probability is the product of Roger being incorrect and at least one non-cheater being correct:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{13}{15} = \\frac{13}{45}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this probability problem. Hmm, the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So the key here is to consider only the non-cheating methods. Let me see the details again.\n\nThe three friends are Alan, Roger, and Peter. Alan guesses randomly with a 1/5 chance. Roger cheats by looking at someone else's paper, so his probability is 2/3. Peter does the calculations, so that's legitimate, with 5/6 chance. \n\nWait, the problem says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So cheating here refers to Roger's method. So we need to exclude any correct answers that come from Roger's cheating. Therefore, the desired probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not considering Roger's contribution? Or wait, maybe the question is about any of the three, but only the cases where the correct answer wasn't achieved through cheating. \n\nWait, the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So perhaps it's considering that the question was answered correctly by someone, but that correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So the correct answer must come from either Alan (who is guessing, which isn't cheating) or Peter (who is working it out, which isn't cheating). Roger's correct answers are via cheating, so they should be excluded. \n\nSo the total probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter (or both) got it right, but not considering Roger's contributions? Or is it the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly without cheating? Wait, maybe I need to rephrase the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\"\u2014so the correct answer must be due to non-cheating methods, so the scenario where the correct answer comes from either Alan's guess or Peter's work. But since each of the three are attempting the question, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that at least one of them answered correctly, but not through cheating. \n\nWait, perhaps the wording is ambiguous, but the problem is likely structured so that each of the three are attempting the question independently. So the overall probability that the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, but that this correct answer isn't due to cheating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of the three answered correctly without cheating, but that's not clear. Wait, perhaps the question is simply the probability that at least one of the non-cheating methods (Alan or Peter) got it right, and Roger's cheating doesn't count. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the question was answered correctly by someone, but that the method wasn't cheating. So that would mean that at least one of Alan or Peter was correct, and Roger was not correct. Because if Roger was correct, then the correct answer could have been via cheating. Hmm, that might be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone (any of the three), but that the method used wasn't cheating. So the correct answer must have been achieved through non-cheating methods, so only Alan or Peter's correct answers count. So the total correct answers via non-cheating would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger could be either way, but the presence of Roger's correct answer (via cheating) would mean that the question's correct answer could have been from cheating. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question states: \"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\" \n\nHmm. So perhaps it's the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one person, and that the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, so the correct answer must have come from either Alan (random guess) or Peter (calculations), but not from Roger. So the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer could have been via cheating. Wait, but maybe the question is interpreted as the answer is correct, and the method used was not cheating. Since each of them are trying independently, perhaps the question is looking for the probability that at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) answered correctly, and that Roger did not cheat in that case? Or perhaps that the correct answer is from a non-cheater, so it must be that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not (since if Roger is correct, then the correct answer might have been via cheating). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer was obtained without cheating, which would mean that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. Wait, but the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So the answer must be correct, and the method used was not cheating. Since each of the three are attempting the question, perhaps the correct answer is considered to be via cheating only if Roger is correct. So the total correct answers not via cheating would be the cases where at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect? Or is it the cases where at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) is correct, regardless of Roger's answer, but the cheating (Roger) didn't contribute to the correct answer?\n\nHmm, maybe another approach is needed. Let me think of all possible scenarios where the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So cheating is only when Roger uses his cheating method. So the correct answer must be due to Alan or Peter's correct answer, and Roger's answer is irrelevant as long as the correct answer is from the non-cheaters. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply the probability that either Alan or Peter (or both) got it right, and Roger didn't cheat (i.e., Roger's answer is wrong). Because if Roger's answer is correct via cheating, then the correct answer is via cheating, so that's excluded. So the desired probability would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, multiplied by the probability that Roger is not correct? Or maybe not, because the question might not require Roger to be wrong, as long as the correct answer isn't via cheating. Wait, maybe the correct answer can come from either Alan or Peter, and Roger's correctness is irrelevant as long as the correct answer is not via cheating. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly, but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So that would mean that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. Because if Roger answered correctly, then that's cheating, so even if someone else also answered correctly, the presence of Roger's cheating answer would mean that the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So the event must be that at least one non-cheater is correct, and Roger is not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one of the non-cheating methods (Alan or Peter) and that Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger did answer correctly, then the cheating method was used. So the scenario where the correct answer is from non-cheating is only when either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cheating is only considered if Roger's answer is correct. So the total probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct (regardless of Roger's answer), but subtract the cases where Roger is correct. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe wording is \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So the correct answer must be achieved without cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, the correct answer must be from either Alan or Peter, and not from Roger. So the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was via cheating, so that's excluded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer can be from either Alan or Peter, but even if Roger also got it right, as long as the correct answer wasn't via cheating. Wait, but Roger's correct answer would be via cheating. So in that case, the presence of Roger's correct answer would mean that the correct answer was via cheating. So the problem wants the case where the correct answer was not via cheating, so the correct answers must come from non-cheaters. \n\nTherefore, the desired probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the question is answered correctly by at least one of the three, but the method used was not cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, then the correct answer must come from Alan or Peter. So the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if Roger is correct, then the cheating method was used. Wait, but the question wants the answer to be correct but not via cheating, so perhaps the existence of a correct answer via non-cheating (so at least one of Alan or Peter is correct) and also that Roger did not use his cheating method (but he did use it, since he's cheating regardless). Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone, but the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So the correct answer must have been from Alan or Peter, so even if Roger also got it right, but as long as at least one of Alan or Peter got it right, then the correct answer could be attributed to them. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that the question's correct answer is considered as coming via cheating only if Roger's method was used, so as long as someone else also got it right, then it's possible that the correct answer wasn't via cheating. But that might complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Maybe it's asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by either Alan or Peter (or both), without considering Roger's answer. Because Roger is cheating, so the \"not via cheating\" would exclude him. Wait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So perhaps the question is answered correctly by at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter), and Roger's answer is irrelevant. \n\nWait, but if the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, then the answer is correct and not via cheating. So the probability would be the probability that Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the question is answered correctly, and the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So the correct answer must have been obtained by a non-cheater. Since each of the three have their own methods, perhaps the question is looking for the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, then his correct answer was via cheating, so that's excluded. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's model the problem:\n\nEach of the three friends answers the question independently. \n\n- Alan's probability of correct: 1/5. Not cheating.\n- Roger's probability of correct: 2/3. Cheating, so any correct answer from him is via cheating.\n- Peter's probability of correct: 5/6. Not cheating.\n\nThe question wants the probability that the question was answered correctly, but not via cheating. \n\nSo, the correct answer must be obtained through non-cheating methods. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer can be from Alan or Peter. However, if Roger also answered correctly, but that's via cheating, but the question's answer being correct is still considered as correct. Wait, maybe the problem is that the question is considered answered correctly by someone, but that the method used was not cheating. So the correct answer must have been obtained without cheating. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. But since all three are attempting, the presence of Roger's correct answer (via cheating) would mean that the correct answer could have come from cheating. Wait, perhaps the problem wants that the correct answer was obtained without cheating, meaning that the correct answer was from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the question is answered correctly by at least one of the three, but the method used was not cheating. Since cheating only applies to Roger, the correct answers must be from Alan or Peter. So the scenario is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if Roger is correct, then the cheating method was used, so that's excluded. \n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is that the correct answer is not via cheating if and only if at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) got it right, and Roger didn't contribute a correct answer via cheating. Wait, no. Maybe it's that the correct answer is not via cheating if at least one of the non-cheaters is correct, regardless of Roger. Because even if Roger also got it right via cheating, the fact that the answer was correct via non-cheating methods is still valid. But the problem says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\", so perhaps the \"but not via cheating\" means that the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So if any of the correct answers were via cheating (i.e., Roger got it right), then that's excluded. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer being via cheating would mean that at least one of the correct answers was obtained through cheating. Therefore, to have the question answered correctly without cheating, we need that all correct answers (if any) are from non-cheating methods. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is considered as answered correctly (at least one of them got it right), but the method used was not cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, that would mean that the correct answer must have been from Alan or Peter, and Roger must have gotten it wrong. Because if Roger got it right, then part of the correctness is via cheating, so the entire scenario would be excluded. \n\nAh, that makes sense. Because if the question is answered correctly by at least one person, but the method wasn't cheating, then Roger must not have contributed a correct answer. So the correct answers must come only from Alan or Peter, and Roger must have gotten it wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone who didn't cheat, so it's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger could be either way. But that might not exclude the case where Roger is also correct. \n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think of possible interpretations and see which leads to one of the answer options. \n\nLet me consider two possible interpretations:\n\nInterpretation 1: The question is answered correctly by at least one of the three, but the correct answer was not obtained via cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, this means that the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. So the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's answer. \n\nIn this case, the probability would be P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - P(not A \u2227 not P). \n\nCalculating that:\n\nP(not A) = 4/5, P(not P) = 1/6. \n\nSo P(not A and not P) = (4/5)(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. \n\nThus P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nBut then we have to consider that the question is answered correctly (so at least one of the three is correct), but the correct answer was not via cheating. Wait, no. Because in this case, even if Roger is correct, but if someone else is also correct, then the correct answer could have been from the non-cheating methods. But the problem says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". Maybe that requires that the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. Since Roger's correct answer is cheating, then any scenario where Roger is correct would be excluded. \n\nSo Interpretation 2: The correct answer must not have been obtained via cheating, so Roger must not have been correct. Additionally, at least one of the others (Alan or Peter) must have been correct. \n\nSo the probability would be: (Probability that Roger is wrong) * (Probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct). \n\nCalculating that:\n\nP(Roger wrong) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. \n\nP(A \u2228 P) as before is 13/15. \n\nSo total probability would be (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45. \n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the answer is correct and not via cheating, which would mean that the correct answer comes from non-cheaters (so at least one of Alan or Peter is correct) AND Roger is incorrect. \n\nSo that's the same as Interpretation 2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly only by non-cheaters. That would mean that at least one non-cheater is correct and Roger is incorrect. \n\nWhich would be the same calculation as above: (1/3)*(1 - P(not A and not P)) = (1/3)*(13/15) = 13/45, which is option E. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: the question is answered correctly not via cheating, so the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if Roger is correct, then the correct answer could be via cheating. Therefore, to have the correct answer not via cheating, we must have that either:\n\nEither Roger is wrong and at least one of A or P is correct, \n\nOR \n\nRoger is right, but both A and P are also right (so the correct answer can be attributed to them, not Roger's cheating). \n\nWait, but that's a different approach. Because if Roger is correct but so are A and/or P, then the correct answer is not solely via cheating. But the problem says \"not via cheating\". Maybe the presence of a correct answer via non-cheating methods would make it acceptable even if Roger also got it right. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the problem wants the probability that the question is answered correctly, and the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So the correct answer must have been obtained through non-cheating methods. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer can be from Alan or Peter, but even if Roger also got it right, as long as someone else did too, it's okay. However, the problem might consider that if Roger's cheating was used to get the correct answer, then that's a problem. But if someone else also got it right, maybe the cheating isn't the source. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply the probability that at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) answered correctly. Because their methods are not cheating. \n\nIn that case, the probability would be 1 - P(neither Alan nor Peter is correct). \n\nWhich is 1 - (4/5)*(1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 = 13/15. But that's not one of the options. \n\nHmm, the options given are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45. \n\nSo 13/15 is not there. So that suggests that interpretation is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one is not cheating. But that would be more complicated. \n\nWait, let's re-express the problem again. \n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. \n\nSo, the \"answered correctly\" part means that at least one of the three is correct. \n\nThe \"but not via cheating\" part means that the method used to get the correct answer wasn't cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, so the correct answer must have been obtained through non-cheating methods (Alan or Peter). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter. So, the scenario is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger's answer is irrelevant as long as the correct answer is from the non-cheaters. However, if Roger is also correct, then the correct answer could have been via cheating. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that the correct answer is not due to cheating. So the correct answer must have been obtained by non-cheating methods, which means that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger's answer doesn't interfere. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer was obtained through non-cheating methods, which requires that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and that Roger is not the sole correct one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the probability that the answer is correct, and it's not Roger's correct answer (since his is cheating). \n\nWait, perhaps the wording means that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that the correct answer was not achieved via cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. \n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not the only one correct. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is not via cheating, so the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. So the total probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's answer. \n\nWait, but that would include cases where Roger is also correct. But in those cases, the correct answer could be via cheating (Roger's method). So maybe those cases should be excluded. \n\nAh! So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the question is answered correctly (so at least one of the three is correct), but the method used to get that correct answer wasn't cheating. Therefore, the correct answer must have been obtained through non-cheating methods. \n\nThus, the correct answer can be from Alan or Peter. \n\nTherefore, the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, AND Roger is not correct (since if Roger is correct, then the method was cheating, so the correct answer could be via cheating). \n\nTherefore, the probability is the probability that (Alan or Peter is correct) AND (Roger is incorrect). \n\nBreaking it down:\n\nProbability that Roger is incorrect: 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. \n\nProbability that Alan or Peter is correct: 1 - (probability both are incorrect). \n\nAlan's incorrect: 4/5, Peter's incorrect: 1/6. \n\nSo probability both incorrect: (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. \n\nSo probability at least one is correct: 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nSo the total probability is (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45. Which is option E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate it directly. \n\nThe desired probability is the probability that Roger is wrong AND (Alan is right OR Peter is right). \n\nWhich is equal to P(Roger wrong) * [1 - P(Alan wrong AND Peter wrong)]. \n\nWhich is exactly what I did above. \n\nSo 1/3 * (13/15) = 13/45, which is option E. \n\nAlternatively, let me check another way. \n\nTotal probability of the question being answered correctly not via cheating is the probability that either Alan is correct and others don't matter (except Roger can't be the one?), no, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, think of all possible cases where the answer is correct via non-cheating:\n\nThe correct answer must come from at least one of Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then cheating was involved. \n\nSo the scenarios are:\n\nCase 1: Alan correct, Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\nCase 2: Alan correct, Peter incorrect, Roger incorrect.\n\nCase 3: Alan incorrect, Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\nThese three cases cover all possibilities where at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. \n\nCalculating each:\n\nCase 1: (1/5)(5/6)(1/3) \n\nWait, let me note that:\n\nRoger's incorrect probability is 1/3. \n\nAlan's correct: 1/5, Peter's correct: 5/6. \n\nSo case1: (1/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (1/5 *5/6) *1/3 = (1/6) *1/3 = 1/18.\n\nCase2: Alan correct (1/5), Peter incorrect (1/6), Roger incorrect (1/3). So (1/5)*(1/6)*(1/3) = (1/30)*(1/3)=1/90.\n\nCase3: Alan incorrect (4/5), Peter correct (5/6), Roger incorrect (1/3). So (4/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (4/6)*(1/3) = (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9.\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\nCase3: (4/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (4/5)*(5/6)=4/6=2/3; 2/3 *1/3 = 2/9. \n\nAdding all three cases:\n\n1/18 + 1/90 + 2/9 \n\nConvert to 90 denominator:\n\n1/18 = 5/90\n\n1/90 = 1/90\n\n2/9 = 20/90\n\nTotal: 5+1+20 =26 \u2192 26/90 = 13/45. \n\nYes, that matches. \n\nSo the correct answer is E)13/45. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we need to consider the contributions of Alan and Peter (non-cheaters) while ensuring Roger (the cheater) does not contribute a correct answer. \n\n1. **Probability Roger answers incorrectly**:  \n   \\( P(\\text{Roger incorrect}) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Probability at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly**:  \n   First, calculate the probability that both Alan and Peter are incorrect:  \n   \\( P(\\text{Alan incorrect}) \\times P(\\text{Peter incorrect}) = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15} \\).  \n   Thus, the probability that at least one is correct is:  \n   \\( 1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15} \\).\n\n3. **Combine both probabilities**:  \n   The desired probability is the product of Roger being incorrect and at least one non-cheater being correct:  \n   \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{13}{15} = \\frac{13}{45} \\).\n\nThis matches option **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this probability problem. Hmm, the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So the key here is to consider only the non-cheating methods. Let me see the details again.\n\nThe three friends are Alan, Roger, and Peter. Alan guesses randomly with a 1/5 chance. Roger cheats by looking at someone else's paper, so his probability is 2/3. Peter does the calculations, so that's legitimate, with 5/6 chance. \n\nWait, the problem says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So cheating here refers to Roger's method. So we need to exclude any correct answers that come from Roger's cheating. Therefore, the desired probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not considering Roger's contribution? Or wait, maybe the question is about any of the three, but only the cases where the correct answer wasn't achieved through cheating. \n\nWait, the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So perhaps it's considering that the question was answered correctly by someone, but that correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So the correct answer must come from either Alan (who is guessing, which isn't cheating) or Peter (who is working it out, which isn't cheating). Roger's correct answers are via cheating, so they should be excluded. \n\nSo the total probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter (or both) got it right, but not considering Roger's contributions? Or is it the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly without cheating? Wait, maybe I need to rephrase the problem. \n\nWait, maybe the question is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\"\u2014so the correct answer must be due to non-cheating methods, so the scenario where the correct answer comes from either Alan's guess or Peter's work. But since each of the three are attempting the question, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that at least one of them answered correctly, but not through cheating. \n\nWait, perhaps the wording is ambiguous, but the problem is likely structured so that each of the three are attempting the question independently. So the overall probability that the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, but that this correct answer isn't due to cheating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of the three answered correctly without cheating, but that's not clear. Wait, perhaps the question is simply the probability that at least one of the non-cheating methods (Alan or Peter) got it right, and Roger's cheating doesn't count. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the question was answered correctly by someone, but that the method wasn't cheating. So that would mean that at least one of Alan or Peter was correct, and Roger was not correct. Because if Roger was correct, then the correct answer could have been via cheating. Hmm, that might be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone (any of the three), but that the method used wasn't cheating. So the correct answer must have been achieved through non-cheating methods, so only Alan or Peter's correct answers count. So the total correct answers via non-cheating would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger could be either way, but the presence of Roger's correct answer (via cheating) would mean that the question's correct answer could have been from cheating. Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question states: \"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\" \n\nHmm. So perhaps it's the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one person, and that the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, so the correct answer must have come from either Alan (random guess) or Peter (calculations), but not from Roger. So the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer could have been via cheating. Wait, but maybe the question is interpreted as the answer is correct, and the method used was not cheating. Since each of them are trying independently, perhaps the question is looking for the probability that at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) answered correctly, and that Roger did not cheat in that case? Or perhaps that the correct answer is from a non-cheater, so it must be that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not (since if Roger is correct, then the correct answer might have been via cheating). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the correct answer was obtained without cheating, which would mean that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. Wait, but the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So the answer must be correct, and the method used was not cheating. Since each of the three are attempting the question, perhaps the correct answer is considered to be via cheating only if Roger is correct. So the total correct answers not via cheating would be the cases where at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect? Or is it the cases where at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) is correct, regardless of Roger's answer, but the cheating (Roger) didn't contribute to the correct answer?\n\nHmm, maybe another approach is needed. Let me think of all possible scenarios where the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So cheating is only when Roger uses his cheating method. So the correct answer must be due to Alan or Peter's correct answer, and Roger's answer is irrelevant as long as the correct answer is from the non-cheaters. Wait, perhaps the problem is simply the probability that either Alan or Peter (or both) got it right, and Roger didn't cheat (i.e., Roger's answer is wrong). Because if Roger's answer is correct via cheating, then the correct answer is via cheating, so that's excluded. So the desired probability would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, multiplied by the probability that Roger is not correct? Or maybe not, because the question might not require Roger to be wrong, as long as the correct answer isn't via cheating. Wait, maybe the correct answer can come from either Alan or Peter, and Roger's correctness is irrelevant as long as the correct answer is not via cheating. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly, but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So that would mean that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger did not. Because if Roger answered correctly, then that's cheating, so even if someone else also answered correctly, the presence of Roger's cheating answer would mean that the correct answer was achieved via cheating. So the event must be that at least one non-cheater is correct, and Roger is not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one of the non-cheating methods (Alan or Peter) and that Roger did not answer correctly. Because if Roger did answer correctly, then the cheating method was used. So the scenario where the correct answer is from non-cheating is only when either Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cheating is only considered if Roger's answer is correct. So the total probability is the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct (regardless of Roger's answer), but subtract the cases where Roger is correct. Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe wording is \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So the correct answer must be achieved without cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, the correct answer must be from either Alan or Peter, and not from Roger. So the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was via cheating, so that's excluded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer can be from either Alan or Peter, but even if Roger also got it right, as long as the correct answer wasn't via cheating. Wait, but Roger's correct answer would be via cheating. So in that case, the presence of Roger's correct answer would mean that the correct answer was via cheating. So the problem wants the case where the correct answer was not via cheating, so the correct answers must come from non-cheaters. \n\nTherefore, the desired probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the question is answered correctly by at least one of the three, but the method used was not cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, then the correct answer must come from Alan or Peter. So the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if Roger is correct, then the cheating method was used. Wait, but the question wants the answer to be correct but not via cheating, so perhaps the existence of a correct answer via non-cheating (so at least one of Alan or Peter is correct) and also that Roger did not use his cheating method (but he did use it, since he's cheating regardless). Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is simply the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone, but the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So the correct answer must have been from Alan or Peter, so even if Roger also got it right, but as long as at least one of Alan or Peter got it right, then the correct answer could be attributed to them. Wait, but maybe the problem is considering that the question's correct answer is considered as coming via cheating only if Roger's method was used, so as long as someone else also got it right, then it's possible that the correct answer wasn't via cheating. But that might complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Maybe it's asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by either Alan or Peter (or both), without considering Roger's answer. Because Roger is cheating, so the \"not via cheating\" would exclude him. Wait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So perhaps the question is answered correctly by at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter), and Roger's answer is irrelevant. \n\nWait, but if the question is answered correctly by either Alan or Peter, then the answer is correct and not via cheating. So the probability would be the probability that Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might mean that the question is answered correctly, and the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So the correct answer must have been obtained by a non-cheater. Since each of the three have their own methods, perhaps the question is looking for the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not. Because if Roger is correct, then his correct answer was via cheating, so that's excluded. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, let's model the problem:\n\nEach of the three friends answers the question independently. \n\n- Alan's probability of correct: 1/5. Not cheating.\n- Roger's probability of correct: 2/3. Cheating, so any correct answer from him is via cheating.\n- Peter's probability of correct: 5/6. Not cheating.\n\nThe question wants the probability that the question was answered correctly, but not via cheating. \n\nSo, the correct answer must be obtained through non-cheating methods. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer can be from Alan or Peter. However, if Roger also answered correctly, but that's via cheating, but the question's answer being correct is still considered as correct. Wait, maybe the problem is that the question is considered answered correctly by someone, but that the method used was not cheating. So the correct answer must have been obtained without cheating. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. But since all three are attempting, the presence of Roger's correct answer (via cheating) would mean that the correct answer could have come from cheating. Wait, perhaps the problem wants that the correct answer was obtained without cheating, meaning that the correct answer was from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the question is answered correctly by at least one of the three, but the method used was not cheating. Since cheating only applies to Roger, the correct answers must be from Alan or Peter. So the scenario is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if Roger is correct, then the cheating method was used, so that's excluded. \n\nWait, perhaps the way to think about it is that the correct answer is not via cheating if and only if at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) got it right, and Roger didn't contribute a correct answer via cheating. Wait, no. Maybe it's that the correct answer is not via cheating if at least one of the non-cheaters is correct, regardless of Roger. Because even if Roger also got it right via cheating, the fact that the answer was correct via non-cheating methods is still valid. But the problem says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\", so perhaps the \"but not via cheating\" means that the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So if any of the correct answers were via cheating (i.e., Roger got it right), then that's excluded. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer being via cheating would mean that at least one of the correct answers was obtained through cheating. Therefore, to have the question answered correctly without cheating, we need that all correct answers (if any) are from non-cheating methods. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the question is considered as answered correctly (at least one of them got it right), but the method used was not cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, that would mean that the correct answer must have been from Alan or Peter, and Roger must have gotten it wrong. Because if Roger got it right, then part of the correctness is via cheating, so the entire scenario would be excluded. \n\nAh, that makes sense. Because if the question is answered correctly by at least one person, but the method wasn't cheating, then Roger must not have contributed a correct answer. So the correct answers must come only from Alan or Peter, and Roger must have gotten it wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone who didn't cheat, so it's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger could be either way. But that might not exclude the case where Roger is also correct. \n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let me think of possible interpretations and see which leads to one of the answer options. \n\nLet me consider two possible interpretations:\n\nInterpretation 1: The question is answered correctly by at least one of the three, but the correct answer was not obtained via cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, this means that the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. So the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's answer. \n\nIn this case, the probability would be P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - P(not A \u2227 not P). \n\nCalculating that:\n\nP(not A) = 4/5, P(not P) = 1/6. \n\nSo P(not A and not P) = (4/5)(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. \n\nThus P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nBut then we have to consider that the question is answered correctly (so at least one of the three is correct), but the correct answer was not via cheating. Wait, no. Because in this case, even if Roger is correct, but if someone else is also correct, then the correct answer could have been from the non-cheating methods. But the problem says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". Maybe that requires that the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. Since Roger's correct answer is cheating, then any scenario where Roger is correct would be excluded. \n\nSo Interpretation 2: The correct answer must not have been obtained via cheating, so Roger must not have been correct. Additionally, at least one of the others (Alan or Peter) must have been correct. \n\nSo the probability would be: (Probability that Roger is wrong) * (Probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct). \n\nCalculating that:\n\nP(Roger wrong) = 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. \n\nP(A \u2228 P) as before is 13/15. \n\nSo total probability would be (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45. \n\nLooking at the options, option E is 13/45. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the answer is correct and not via cheating, which would mean that the correct answer comes from non-cheaters (so at least one of Alan or Peter is correct) AND Roger is incorrect. \n\nSo that's the same as Interpretation 2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly only by non-cheaters. That would mean that at least one non-cheater is correct and Roger is incorrect. \n\nWhich would be the same calculation as above: (1/3)*(1 - P(not A and not P)) = (1/3)*(13/15) = 13/45, which is option E. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: the question is answered correctly not via cheating, so the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if Roger is correct, then the correct answer could be via cheating. Therefore, to have the correct answer not via cheating, we must have that either:\n\nEither Roger is wrong and at least one of A or P is correct, \n\nOR \n\nRoger is right, but both A and P are also right (so the correct answer can be attributed to them, not Roger's cheating). \n\nWait, but that's a different approach. Because if Roger is correct but so are A and/or P, then the correct answer is not solely via cheating. But the problem says \"not via cheating\". Maybe the presence of a correct answer via non-cheating methods would make it acceptable even if Roger also got it right. \n\nHmm, this complicates things. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the problem wants the probability that the question is answered correctly, and the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So the correct answer must have been obtained through non-cheating methods. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer can be from Alan or Peter, but even if Roger also got it right, as long as someone else did too, it's okay. However, the problem might consider that if Roger's cheating was used to get the correct answer, then that's a problem. But if someone else also got it right, maybe the cheating isn't the source. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simply the probability that at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) answered correctly. Because their methods are not cheating. \n\nIn that case, the probability would be 1 - P(neither Alan nor Peter is correct). \n\nWhich is 1 - (4/5)*(1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 = 13/15. But that's not one of the options. \n\nHmm, the options given are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45. \n\nSo 13/15 is not there. So that suggests that interpretation is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one is not cheating. But that would be more complicated. \n\nWait, let's re-express the problem again. \n\nThe question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. \n\nSo, the \"answered correctly\" part means that at least one of the three is correct. \n\nThe \"but not via cheating\" part means that the method used to get the correct answer wasn't cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, so the correct answer must have been obtained through non-cheating methods (Alan or Peter). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter. So, the scenario is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger's answer is irrelevant as long as the correct answer is from the non-cheaters. However, if Roger is also correct, then the correct answer could have been via cheating. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem requires that the correct answer is not due to cheating. So the correct answer must have been obtained by non-cheating methods, which means that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger's answer doesn't interfere. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer was obtained through non-cheating methods, which requires that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and that Roger is not the sole correct one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the probability that the answer is correct, and it's not Roger's correct answer (since his is cheating). \n\nWait, perhaps the wording means that the question is answered correctly by someone, but that the correct answer was not achieved via cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. \n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not the only one correct. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is not via cheating, so the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. So the total probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger's answer. \n\nWait, but that would include cases where Roger is also correct. But in those cases, the correct answer could be via cheating (Roger's method). So maybe those cases should be excluded. \n\nAh! So perhaps the correct interpretation is that the question is answered correctly (so at least one of the three is correct), but the method used to get that correct answer wasn't cheating. Therefore, the correct answer must have been obtained through non-cheating methods. \n\nThus, the correct answer can be from Alan or Peter. \n\nTherefore, the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, AND Roger is not correct (since if Roger is correct, then the method was cheating, so the correct answer could be via cheating). \n\nTherefore, the probability is the probability that (Alan or Peter is correct) AND (Roger is incorrect). \n\nBreaking it down:\n\nProbability that Roger is incorrect: 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. \n\nProbability that Alan or Peter is correct: 1 - (probability both are incorrect). \n\nAlan's incorrect: 4/5, Peter's incorrect: 1/6. \n\nSo probability both incorrect: (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. \n\nSo probability at least one is correct: 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nSo the total probability is (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45. Which is option E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate it directly. \n\nThe desired probability is the probability that Roger is wrong AND (Alan is right OR Peter is right). \n\nWhich is equal to P(Roger wrong) * [1 - P(Alan wrong AND Peter wrong)]. \n\nWhich is exactly what I did above. \n\nSo 1/3 * (13/15) = 13/45, which is option E. \n\nAlternatively, let me check another way. \n\nTotal probability of the question being answered correctly not via cheating is the probability that either Alan is correct and others don't matter (except Roger can't be the one?), no, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, think of all possible cases where the answer is correct via non-cheating:\n\nThe correct answer must come from at least one of Alan or Peter, and Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then cheating was involved. \n\nSo the scenarios are:\n\nCase 1: Alan correct, Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\nCase 2: Alan correct, Peter incorrect, Roger incorrect.\n\nCase 3: Alan incorrect, Peter correct, Roger incorrect.\n\nThese three cases cover all possibilities where at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. \n\nCalculating each:\n\nCase 1: (1/5)(5/6)(1/3) \n\nWait, let me note that:\n\nRoger's incorrect probability is 1/3. \n\nAlan's correct: 1/5, Peter's correct: 5/6. \n\nSo case1: (1/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (1/5 *5/6) *1/3 = (1/6) *1/3 = 1/18.\n\nCase2: Alan correct (1/5), Peter incorrect (1/6), Roger incorrect (1/3). So (1/5)*(1/6)*(1/3) = (1/30)*(1/3)=1/90.\n\nCase3: Alan incorrect (4/5), Peter correct (5/6), Roger incorrect (1/3). So (4/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (4/6)*(1/3) = (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9.\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\nCase3: (4/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (4/5)*(5/6)=4/6=2/3; 2/3 *1/3 = 2/9. \n\nAdding all three cases:\n\n1/18 + 1/90 + 2/9 \n\nConvert to 90 denominator:\n\n1/18 = 5/90\n\n1/90 = 1/90\n\n2/9 = 20/90\n\nTotal: 5+1+20 =26 \u2192 26/90 = 13/45. \n\nYes, that matches. \n\nSo the correct answer is E)13/45. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be E.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we need to consider the contributions of Alan and Peter (non-cheaters) while ensuring Roger (the cheater) does not contribute a correct answer. \n\n1. **Probability Roger answers incorrectly**:  \n   \\( P(\\text{Roger incorrect}) = 1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3} \\).\n\n2. **Probability at least one of Alan or Peter answers correctly**:  \n   First, calculate the probability that both Alan and Peter are incorrect:  \n   \\( P(\\text{Alan incorrect}) \\times P(\\text{Peter incorrect}) = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15} \\).  \n   Thus, the probability that at least one is correct is:  \n   \\( 1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15} \\).\n\n3. **Combine both probabilities**:  \n   The desired probability is the product of Roger being incorrect and at least one non-cheater being correct:  \n   \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{13}{15} = \\frac{13}{45} \\).\n\nThis matches option **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",
