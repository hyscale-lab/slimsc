      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount on all items for one day and now wants to go back to the original price the next day. The question is asking by what percentage he needs to increase the discounted price to get back to the original price. Hmm, percentage increase from the discounted price to original.\n\nLet me think. Let's start by assuming the original price of an item. Let's say the original price is, I don't know, $100. That's an easy number to work with. So if the original price is $100, and there's a 20% discount, then the discounted price would be 80% of the original. So 20% off of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is $80. \n\nNow, the next day he wants to sell it again at the original $100. So he has to increase the $80 back to $100. The question is, what's the percentage increase needed on the $80 to get to $100?\n\nWait, percentage increase is calculated based on the original value, which in this case is the discounted price now. Because when you have a percentage increase, it's the percentage of the starting value. So the formula would be: (Final - Initial)/Initial * 100%.\n\nSo here, the initial price after discount is $80, and the final is $100. The difference is $20. So 20 divided by 80 times 100. Let's calculate that: 20/80 = 0.25, so 0.25 * 100 is 25%. So that would be a 25% increase. \n\nWait, but why do I think that? Let me check again. Because if you take 25% of 80, that's 20. So 80 plus 20 is 100. Yep, that works. So the correct answer should be 25%, which is option C. \n\nHmm, but sometimes people get confused between percentage decrease and increase. Like, if you decrease by 20%, you can't just increase by 20% to get back because the base changes. For instance, if you have a 20% discount, then a 20% increase on the discounted price would only get you part of the way. But in this case, the calculation seems right. Let me try another example to confirm.\n\nSuppose the original price was $50. 20% off would be $40. To get back to $50 from $40, the increase needed is $10. So 10/40 is 0.25, which is 25%. Yep, same result. So that seems consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using variables. Let me let the original price be P. The discounted price is P*(1 - 0.20) = 0.8P. Let the required percentage increase be x. So, 0.8P * (1 + x) = P. Solving for x: (1 + x) = P/(0.8P) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So x is 0.25, which is 25%. So that's the same answer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C)25%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage increase needed to return to the original price after a 20% discount, let's use an example. Suppose the original price is $100. A 20% discount reduces it to $80. To return to $100 from $80, the increase required is $20. The percentage increase is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{20}{80} \\right) \\times 100\\% = 25\\%\n\\]\n\nThis calculation holds for any original price. Using algebra, if the original price is \\( P \\), the discounted price is \\( 0.8P \\). Let \\( x \\) be the required percentage increase:\n\n\\[\n0.8P \\times (1 + x) = P \\implies 1 + x = \\frac{1}{0.8} = 1.25 \\implies x = 0.25 \\text{ or } 25\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C)25%**.\n\nAnswer: C",

Let's say the original price of an item is, I don't know, let's pick a number to make it easier. Maybe $100. Because percentages are easier with 100. So original price is $100. \n\nIf there's a 20% discount, then the discounted price would be 100 minus 20% of 100. 20% of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is $80. \n\nNow, the next day, he wants to sell it at the original $100 again. So he has to increase the $80 price back to $100. The question is, what's the percentage increase from 80 to 100?\n\nTo calculate percentage increase, the formula is: ((New Price - Old Price)/Old Price) * 100. \n\nSo here, the old price after discount is 80, new is 100.

So that would be a 25% increase. \n\nWait, but why do people sometimes get confused here? Oh right, because percentage increase is based on the original value. So if you decrease by 20%, then to get back, the percentage isn't the same. Like if you have a 20% decrease, the reverse isn't 20% increase. Because the base changes. \n\nLet me check another example to be sure. Let's say original is $50. 20% off would be $40. To get back to 50 from 40, that's a 10 increase. 10/40 is 25% again. Yep, so the answer should be 25%, which is option C. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25%, so that must be the correct one. The other options: 20% would only get back part. Like 20% of 80 is 16, so 80+16=96, which is not 100. So that's not enough. 33% would be higher, but 33% of 80 is like 26.4, which would overshoot. So yeah, 25% makes sense.\n",
