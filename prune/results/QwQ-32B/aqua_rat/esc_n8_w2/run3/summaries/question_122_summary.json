      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out how long it takes for a cyclist going 12 miles per hour to travel 48 miles. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the time in minutes, right? Alright, first I remember that time equals distance divided by speed. So the basic formula is time = distance / speed.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers. The distance here is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. So dividing 48 by 12 gives... that's 4. Wait, but that's in hours, right? Because the speed is per hour. So 4 hours is the time. But the question wants the answer in minutes. Oh right, so I need to convert hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, multiplying 4 by 60 should do it. Let me calculate that: 4 times 60 is 240. So that would be 240 minutes. Let me check the options. Option B is 240, so that must be the answer. \n\nWait, just making sure I didn't mix up anything. If the cyclist is moving at 12 mph, then in one hour they go 12 miles. So for 48 miles, it's like 12 * 4 = 48, so 4 hours. Yeah, that makes sense. Converting 4 hours into minutes, yeah, 4*60 is definitely 240. So the answer should be B. Let me look at the options again. Options are A)1, B)240, C)30, D)60, E)120. Yep, B is there. I think that's right.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many minutes it takes for a cyclist traveling at 12 miles per hour to cover 48 miles, we use the formula:  \n**Time (hours) = Distance / Speed**.  \n\nPlugging in the values:  \nTime = 48 miles / 12 mph = 4 hours.  \n\nSince the question asks for the time in minutes, we convert hours to minutes:  \n4 hours \u00d7 60 minutes/hour = 240 minutes.  \n\nThus, the correct answer is **B)240**.  \n\nAnswer: B",

The options are A to E, with numbers like 1, 240, 30, 60, and 120. Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, I remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. The basic formula is time = distance / speed. But wait, the speed here is in miles per hour, and the question asks for minutes. Oh right, so I need to convert hours to minutes at some point.\n\nLet me start by calculating the time in hours. The distance is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. So dividing 48 by 12 gives... 4. So that's 4 hours. But the answer needs to be in minutes. Since one hour is 60 minutes, multiplying 4 by 60 should give the time in minutes. Let me do that: 4 times 60 is 240. So that would be 240 minutes. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 240. So the answer should be B. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't mess up the units. The cyclist's speed is 12 mph, so in one hour, they go 12 miles. To go 48 miles, how many hours? Yeah, 48 divided by 12 is indeed 4 hours. Converting that to minutes, 4*60 is 240. Yeah, that makes sense. Let me look at the options again. Option B is 240. The other options don't fit. Like, 60 minutes would be 1 hour, which would only cover 12 miles. 120 minutes is 2 hours, which would be 24 miles. So 240 is the right one. I think that's correct.\n",
