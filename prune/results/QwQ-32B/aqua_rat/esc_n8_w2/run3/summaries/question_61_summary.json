      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the total number of students in a class based on the percentages interested in different sports and the remaining students not interested. Hmm, I need to set up an equation here.\n\nSo, let me parse the question again. 8% are into Football. Then 4/5 of the total are into Cricket. 10% like Basketball. The rest, which is 20 students, aren't interested in any. \n\nLet me denote the total number of students as T. Then, each percentage or fraction would be in terms of T. \n\nSo, Football: 8% of T \u2192 0.08T\nCricket: 4/5 of T \u2192 (4/5)T. Wait, 4/5 is 80%, so that's 0.8T. \nBasketball: 10% \u2192 0.10T\nThe rest (those not interested) are 20 students. \n\nThe sum of all these should equal the total number of students. Wait, but actually, the students interested in the sports plus those not interested should equal T. \n\nWait, maybe adding up the percentages and fractions of interested students and subtracting from total gives the remaining 20. Let me think. \n\nSo, the students interested in at least one of the sports are: 8% + 4/5 + 10% of T. Wait, but percentages and fractions need to be converted to the same terms. Let me compute all in percentages. \n\n4/5 is 80%, so adding all the given percentages: 8% (Football) + 80% (Cricket) + 10% (Basketball) = 98%. \n\nWait, so 98% are interested in those three sports, and the remaining 2% are the 20 students who aren't interested. \n\nAh, that makes sense. So 2% of T equals 20. \n\nThen, 0.02 * T = 20 \u2192 T = 20 / 0.02 = 1000. \n\nWait, but hold on, let me check again. Because maybe there's an overlap. The problem says \"interested in Football\", \"interested in Cricket\", etc. But the question doesn't mention if someone can be interested in more than one sport. So, does that mean the percentages could be overlapping? Hmm, but the problem states the total percentages add up to 98%, so perhaps the question assumes that the percentages are non-overlapping? Or maybe it's intended that the total interested is the sum of the given percentages, so that the remaining is 2% which is 20 students. \n\nIf that's the case, then the total students would be 1000. But looking at the options, E is 1000. But let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in adding. Let me re-calculate:\n\n8% + 80% (from 4/5) + 10% = 98% total interested. So remaining is 2% which is 20. So 2% of total =20 \u2192 total= 20/(0.02)=1000. \n\nSo the answer would be E)1000. But wait, looking at the options, the other options are 850, 800, etc. Let me see if I messed up the fractions. \n\nWait, 4/5 is 0.8, so 80%, correct. 8% + 80% is 88, plus 10 is 98. So yes, 2% left. \n\nHmm, but let me check the problem statement again. The question says \"remaining 20 students are not interested in any games\". So the way the problem is presented, it's implying that all the students interested in any of the three sports are accounted for by those percentages, and the rest are not in any. \n\nTherefore the calculation seems right, leading to 1000. But let me check the options again. The options include E)1000, so that's possible. \n\nWait, but maybe there's an error here. Let me see. Suppose the total is 1000. Then:\n\nFootball: 8% of 1000 = 80 students. Cricket: 4/5 of 1000 is 800. Basketball: 10% is 100. Adding those up: 80+800+100=980. So total interested is 980, and the remaining 20 (1000-980) are not interested. That matches exactly. \n\nSo the answer should be E)1000. But let me check the other options to ensure. Let's try option C)900. Let's see. If total was 900, then:\n\nFootball: 72, Cricket: 720, Basketball:90. Total interested: 72+720+90= 882. Remaining: 900-882=18. But the problem says remaining is 20, so that's not matching. \n\nSimilarly, for option B)800: 8% of 800 is 64, Cricket: 640, Basketball 80. Sum:64+640+80=784. 800-784=16. Not 20. \n\nOption A)850: 8% is 68, cricket 680, basketball 85. Total 68+680+85=833. 850-833=17. Not 20. \n\nOption D)950: 8% is 76, cricket 760, basketball 95. Sum 76+760=836 +95= 931. 950-931=19. Still not 20. \n\nOnly E gives exactly 20. So the correct answer is E. \n\nHmm, but wait, the options given in the problem include E as 1000, so that's correct. So the answer should be E.\n",

The problem says \"interested in Football\", \"interested in Cricket\", etc., but maybe some students are counted in more than one category. So adding their percentages could lead to overcounting. But the problem doesn't mention anything about overlaps. Hmm, this is a common issue in such problems. \n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. The problem might be assuming that the percentages are non-overlapping. Like, each student is only counted in one category.
