      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. Julie's yard is rectangular. So, a rectangle has two pairs of equal sides. The problem says one side is 100 feet wide. Wait, in a rectangle, the opposite sides are equal. So if one side is 100 feet, then the opposite side is also 100. But the question is asking for the length of the other side. Hmm, right.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying length and width. The total area is given as 3,000 square feet. So, area = length \u00d7 width. Here, one of the sides (either length or width) is 100. Wait, but which one is it? The problem says \"one side is 100 feet wide.\" The term \"wide\" might refer to the width, so maybe the width is 100 feet, and we need to find the length. Alternatively, maybe the 100 feet is the length, and the other side (width) is to be found. But the wording says \"one side is 100 feet wide,\" so perhaps the width is 100, so the other side's length would be calculated by dividing the area by the width.\n\nLet me think again. Let's denote the sides. Let's say the width is 100 feet. Then the area would be length multiplied by 100. So, 3000 = length \u00d7 100. Therefore, length would be 3000 / 100 = 30 feet. That would be option A. But wait, maybe I have the terms mixed up. Sometimes people refer to length and width in different ways. Like, maybe the 100 feet is the length, and the other side (width) is to be found. Wait, but the question is asking for the \"other side,\" so regardless of which one is which, since in a rectangle adjacent sides are of different lengths. So if one side is 100, the adjacent side (the other side) would be the one we need to find.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think of it as: the two dimensions are length and width. Let me set variables. Let's say the given width is 100, so the length is the other dimension. So area = length \u00d7 width \u2192 3000 = length \u00d7 100 \u2192 length = 30. So that would be option A. But the options include 30 as option A. Alternatively, maybe the 100 is the length, and the question is asking for the width. Wait, but then the problem would say \"the other side's width,\" but the question says \"the length of the other side.\" Hmm. The problem states the question is asking for the length of the other side, so perhaps regardless of the terms, the other side's length is the one they want. Wait, but in a rectangle, the sides are length and width, so the other side's length would be the other dimension. So, for example, if one side (length) is 100, then the other side (width) would be 3000 divided by 100, which is 30. But then the question is asking for the length of the other side. Wait, maybe the term \"length\" here refers to the dimension, not the side's direction. Like, regardless of which is length or width, the other dimension's length is needed. So, perhaps the answer is 30, which is option A. But let me check the options again. The options are A)30, B)20, C)10, D)50, E)60. So 30 is an option. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using \"width\" as one of the sides, so the other side's length would be the length. Wait, maybe the problem is that I assumed that the 100 feet is the width. But perhaps the 100 is the length, and the width is what we need to find. Let me see. The problem says \"one side of the yard is 100 feet wide.\" The wording here is tricky. The phrase \"100 feet wide\" might mean that the width is 100. So if the width is 100, then the length would be area divided by width, so 3000/100 = 30. That gives 30, which is option A. Alternatively, if the 100 is the length, then the width would be 3000/100 = 30, but the question asks for the length of the other side. Wait, the other side would be the width, but the question says \"length of the other side,\" so maybe that's the confusion here. Because in a rectangle, the sides are length and width. The \"other side\" would be the other dimension, but the question is asking for its length, so perhaps they are referring to the measurement as length regardless of direction. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question is: What is the length of the other side of the yard? So the sides are two different measurements. Since it's a rectangle, adjacent sides are length and width, but the terms might be interchangeable. The problem says \"one side is 100 feet wide,\" so the width is 100. The area is length multiplied by width. So length would be 3000 divided by 100, which is 30. Therefore, the answer should be A)30.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Suppose that the 100 is the length. Then the area is length \u00d7 width \u2192 100 \u00d7 width = 3000 \u2192 width is 30. So the other side (the width) is 30 feet. The question asks for the length of the other side. Wait, but the \"other side\" here would be the side that's the width. But the question uses \"length of the other side,\" so maybe that's the confusion. Because the side's length would be 30, regardless. So whether the 100 is length or width, the other side's measurement is 30, so the answer is 30. So option A makes sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think if there's another approach. Maybe the sides are considered as length and width, so if one side (length) is 100, then the other (width) is 30. The question is asking for the length of the other side, which would be the width, but the term \"length\" here might be a misnomer, but perhaps they just mean the measurement. So the answer is 30. So I think the correct answer is A.\n",
