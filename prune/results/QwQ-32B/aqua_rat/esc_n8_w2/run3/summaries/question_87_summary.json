      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about finding the minimum number of students in a school where there are more than 501 students. The conditions given are that exactly 20% took physics and exactly 28% took math. Hmm, right, so I need to find the smallest possible number of students that satisfies all these conditions. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the question again. The total number of students must be more than 501. The percentages given are for students who took exactly physics and exactly math. Wait, the wording says \"exactly took physics\" and \"exactly took math.\" Oh right, that probably means that these percentages are the students who took only physics, not both physics and math, and similarly for math. Because if they had taken both, they wouldn't be in the \"exactly\" category. So the 20% are only physics, and 28% are only math. \n\nWait, but then the question is about the total number of students. The key here is that percentages have to result in whole numbers of students, right? Because you can't have a fraction of a student. So the total number of students must be such that 20% of it and 28% of it are integers. \n\nSo let me denote the total number of students as N. Then:\n\n20% of N = 0.2*N must be an integer.\n\n28% of N = 0.28*N must also be an integer.\n\nAdditionally, N must be greater than 501. We need the smallest such N that satisfies all these conditions.\n\nSo first, let's figure out what N must be divisible by to make those percentages integers. \n\nLet me write 0.2N as (1/5)N. So N must be divisible by 5 so that 1/5 N is an integer.\n\nSimilarly, 0.28N is equal to 28/100 N, which simplifies to 7/25 N. Wait, 28 divided by 100 is 7/25. So 7/25 * N must be an integer. \n\nTherefore, N must be a multiple of 25/ gcd(7,25). Since 7 and 25 are coprime (their gcd is 1), so N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nWait, let me think again. For 7/25 * N to be an integer, N must be a multiple of 25 divided by the GCD of 7 and 25. Since GCD(7,25)=1, so N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nWait, but also, the 20% part requires N divisible by 5. So the LCM of 5 and 25 is 25. So N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me think in terms of denominators. Let me see:\n\n0.2 is 1/5. So N must be divisible by 5.\n\n0.28 is 28/100 = 7/25. So to have 7/25*N be integer, N must be divisible by 25. Because 7 and 25 are coprime, so 25 must divide N. \n\nTherefore, N must be a multiple of 25. Since it must also be a multiple of 5 (which it already is if it's a multiple of 25), so the key is that N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nTherefore the minimal N would be the smallest multiple of 25 that is greater than 501. \n\nWait, but hold on, the options given are 550, 570, 600, 700, and E. Let's see. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe there's another condition. The problem says \"exactly took physics\" and \"exactly took math.\" So perhaps the total number of students taking either subject can't exceed N. But maybe that's not an issue here. Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that exactly 20% took physics (only physics) and exactly 28% took math (only math). So the total number of students taking either only physics or only math would be 20% + 28% = 48%, so 48% of N. But what about students who took both or neither? The problem doesn't specify those, so perhaps they can exist. But the problem only gives the percentages for those who took exactly one of the subjects. \n\nHowever, the main constraints here are that 20% of N and 28% of N must be integers. So the problem reduces to finding the smallest N>501 which is divisible by 25 (since 28% requires N divisible by 25) and also divisible by 5 (which it already is). \n\nWait, but wait, let me recheck the 28% part again. Let's see, 28% of N must be an integer. 28% is 28/100 = 7/25. Therefore, 7N/25 must be integer, so N must be a multiple of 25, because 7 and 25 are coprime. So yes, N must be divisible by 25. \n\nTherefore the minimal N over 501 would be 525 (since 500 is the first multiple of 25 below 501, so next is 525). But 525 is more than 501? 525 is 500+25, which is 525. But 525 is more than 501, so that would be the minimal. But wait, the options given start at 550. Hmm. Wait, so 525 isn't an option here. The options are A)550, B)570, etc. So maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, maybe there's another condition I missed. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is that the percentages are exactly the students who took physics (regardless of math), but no, the problem says \"exactly took physics\" which probably means only physics. But even so, the percentages must be integers. So the minimal N would be 25? No, but N has to be over 501.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the LCM. Let me think again. Let me re-express the problem:\n\nThe number of students taking only physics is 0.2*N, which must be integer.\n\nThe number taking only math is 0.28*N, which must also be integer.\n\nTherefore, N must be such that N is divisible by 5 (for the 20%) and divisible by 25 (for the 28%). Wait, no, let me check again:\n\nWait 20% is 1/5, so N must be divisible by 5. \n\n28% is 28/100 = 7/25. So 7N/25 must be integer. Since 7 and 25 are coprime, N must be a multiple of 25. So the LCM of 5 and 25 is 25, so N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nTherefore, the smallest N over 501 would be 525 (since 500 is the previous multiple of 25). But 525 is less than 501? Wait no, 501 is the minimum. Wait, the problem states \"more than 501 students\". So N must be at least 502. The next multiple of 25 after 500 is 525. But 525 is 525, which is more than 501. But 525 is not one of the options given (the options are 550,570,600, etc). So perhaps my reasoning is wrong?\n\nHmm. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe there's another constraint here. The problem says \"there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math.\" \n\nWait, perhaps the percentages must add up to less than 100%, but even that's not required here. But maybe the question requires that the total number of students taking physics or math or both must not exceed N? But the problem only gives the numbers for exactly physics and exactly math. So the rest could be taking neither or both. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for the 28% part. Let me check that again. 28% as a fraction is 28/100, which reduces to 7/25. So 7/25 * N must be integer. So N must be a multiple of 25, because 7 and 25 are coprime. Therefore, yes, N must be divisible by 25. So the minimal N over 501 is 525. Since 500 is 20x25, so 21x25 is 525. \n\nBut since 525 isn't among the options, perhaps I need to check if there's another condition. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the problem is that the students taking both subjects can't be counted in either percentage? So the total number of students taking physics (including those who took both) would be more than 20%, but the 20% is exactly those who took only physics. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the total percentage of students taking physics (regardless of math) is 20%, but that doesn't fit with the wording. The question says \"exactly took physics\" so that's only those who took physics and not math. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the numbers of students in each subject must be integers, but maybe also the total of the two percentages must not exceed 100%? Let's see, 20 +28 =48% which is way under 100%, so that's okay. \n\nHmm. So according to my calculations, the minimal N is 525, which is not an option here. The options given start at 550, so maybe the correct answer is E) none of these. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again:\n\nWait, perhaps the percentages are 20% took physics (could include those who also took math?), but the problem says \"exactly took physics\" so that means they took physics but not math. So the count is exactly those in physics only. So the same with math. \n\nSo the problem requires that 0.2*N and 0.28*N are integers, and N>501. \n\nSo N must be divisible by 25 (for 28% part) and divisible by 5 (for 20% part). Since 25 is a multiple of 5, the LCM is 25. Therefore N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nThus the minimal N over 501 is 525. Since none of the options is 525, the answer must be E) none of these. \n\nLooking at the options given: A is 550, which is 550/25 =22, so yes divisible by 25. But 525 is smaller. But the options don't have 525, so the answer is E. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other possible mistake. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the LCM. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the 20% requires N divisible by 5. The 28% requires N divisible by 25. So the LCM is 25, so N must be divisible by 25. So the minimal N over 501 is 525. Since that's not an option, E is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the number of students in both subjects is also an integer? But the problem doesn't specify anything about that. The question only mentions the exactly physics and exactly math. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in how I considered the percentages. Let me see:\n\nWait, 20% is 0.2*N. For this to be integer, N must be divisible by 5 (since 0.2 is 1/5). \n\n28% is 0.28*N. 0.28 is 28/100 =7/25. So for 7/25*N to be integer, N must be divisible by 25. \n\nSo yes, N has to be a multiple of 25. So the first N over 501 is 525. Since that's not an option, the answer must be E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is interpreted differently. Like, perhaps 20% took physics (could include those who took both), and 28% took math (could include those who took both), but then the exactly part would be different. Wait, the wording says \"exactly took physics\", which would mean they took only physics. So the initial approach is correct. \n\nTherefore, the minimal possible N is 525. Since that's not listed, the answer must be E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So the question is about finding the minimum number of students in a school where exactly 20% took physics and exactly 28% took math. The total number of students is more than 501. The options are given, and we need to find the smallest possible number.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that percentages have to result in whole numbers because you can't have a fraction of a student. So 20% of the total students must be an integer, and similarly, 28% must also be an integer. Let me write that down. Let the total number of students be N. Then, 0.2*N must be an integer, and 0.28*N must also be an integer. \n\nWait, right. So N has to be such that when multiplied by 0.2 and 0.28, both results are whole numbers. Let's think about the prime factors here. 20% is 1/5, so N must be divisible by 5. Because 20% of N is (1/5)*N, so N must be a multiple of 5. \n\nFor 28%, which is 28/100, that simplifies to 7/25. So 28% of N is (7/25)*N. To make that an integer, 25 must divide N. Because 25 times something divided by 25 gives an integer. Wait, let me see. The denominator here is 25, so N must be a multiple of 25 divided by the numerator's factors? Wait, no, maybe better to think in terms of fractions.\n\nAlternatively, the denominator of the simplified fraction must divide N. Let me see. 28% is 28/100 = 7/25. So (7/25)*N must be integer, so 25 must divide N? Because 7 and 25 are coprime (they have no common factors besides 1), so yes, N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let me write 28% as 28/100, so N*(28/100) must be integer. So N must be such that 28N is divisible by 100. So 28N divisible by 100. Let's factorize 28 and 100. 28 is 4*7, 100 is 4*25. So 28N divisible by 100 \u2192 (4*7*N) divisible by (4*25) \u2192 7*N divisible by 25. Since 7 and 25 are coprime, N must be divisible by 25. So N has to be a multiple of 25. \n\nSimilarly, for the 20%, which is 20/100 = 1/5. So N must be divisible by 5, which is already covered if it's a multiple of 25. So the key is that N must be a multiple of 25. But wait, maybe there's more to it. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 20% of N must be an integer. 20% is 1/5, so N must be divisible by 5. The 28% requires N divisible by 25. Therefore, the least common multiple of 5 and 25 is 25. So the smallest N that satisfies both conditions is 25. But the problem states there are more than 501 students, so we need the smallest N greater than 501 that's a multiple of 25. Wait, but hold on, maybe there's another condition I'm missing here.\n\nWait the question says \"exactly took physics\" and \"exactly took math.\" Does that mean that the students taking both subjects are not counted in either percentage? Because if they took both, then they wouldn't be part of the \"exactly\" counts. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Wait, maybe I need to think about overlapping. Wait, the problem says \"exactly took physics\" and \"exactly took math,\" so those are students who took only physics and only math. So the total number of students taking either could be higher, but the counts given are only for those who took exactly one of the subjects. \n\nBut does that affect the total number? Hmm. Wait, the problem is just asking for the total number of students in the school, given that exactly 20% took physics (only physics), and exactly 28% took math (only math). The rest could have taken neither or both, but the percentages given are exact for those categories. \n\nSo the total number of students must be such that 20% and 28% are integers. So the earlier reasoning holds. So N must be divisible by 25, and also by 5, but 25 already covers that. So the minimal N over 501 would be the first multiple of 25 after 501. Let's calculate that. \n\n501 divided by 25 is 20.04. So the next integer multiple is 21*25=525. Wait, but 21*25 is 525. But the options given are 550, 570, 600, 700, or E. So 525 is not one of the options. Wait, but the options start at 550, which is 22*25=550. Hmm. So perhaps there's an error here. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. \n\nWait 25*20 is 500, which is exactly 500. Since the problem says more than 501, so the next multiple is 525. But 525 is less than 550. So why is 550 an option? Maybe I missed something here. \n\nWait, perhaps there's another condition. Let me re-read the problem. \n\n\"there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?\"\n\nHmm, maybe the percentages can't overlap? Wait, no, the problem says \"exactly took physics\" and \"exactly took math\", so students who took both would not be included in either percentage. So the total students who took only physics plus only math plus those who took neither or both must add up to the total. \n\nBut the key is that the percentages must be integers. So N has to be such that 0.2*N and 0.28*N are integers. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the LCM. Let me think again. \n\nWait, 20% is 1/5, so N must be divisible by 5. \n\n28% is 28/100 = 7/25. So for (7/25)*N to be integer, N must be divisible by 25/gcd(7,25). Since gcd(7,25) is 1, so N must be divisible by 25. \n\nTherefore, LCM of 5 and 25 is 25. So N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nSo the minimal N over 501 is 525 (21\u00d725). But 525 is not among the options. The options are A)550, B)570, C)600, D)700, E)none. So the answer would be E, since 525 is not listed, and the next options are higher. Wait, but why would the options not include 525? Did I miss something here?\n\nWait, perhaps there's another constraint. Wait, maybe the problem is that the percentages can't overlap in such a way that the total would exceed 100%? Let me see. \n\nWait, the students who took exactly physics are 20%, exactly math is 28%. The total of these two is 48%. So the remaining 52% could be those who took neither or both. But that's okay. So that's acceptable. So the total N just needs to satisfy that 20% and 28% are integers. \n\nSo the minimal N over 501 is 525, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is looking for a different approach. Maybe I made an error in the calculation of the required divisors?\n\nLet me check again. Let me think of 20% as 20/100 = 1/5, so N must be divisible by 5. 28% is 28/100 = 7/25, so N must be divisible by 25. So the LCM of 5 and 25 is 25. So N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nSo the minimal N over 501 is 525. Since the options start at 550, which is 22\u00d725=550, but 525 is smaller. Therefore, the answer must be E) none of these, because none of the given options are 525. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The first option is 550, which is 22\u00d725. 550 is more than 501. But since 525 is possible and it's less than 550, but it's not listed, so the correct answer would be E. So the answer is E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the percentage calculations. Let me check with 525 students. 20% of 525 is 105, which is an integer. 28% of 525 is 147, which is also an integer. So 525 works, but it's not an option here. The options given are A)550, B)570, C)600, D)700, so the correct answer is E. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So the question is about finding the minimum number of students in a school where exactly 20% took physics and exactly 28% took math. The total number of students is more than 501. The options are given, and we need to find the smallest possible number.\n\nHmm, first, I remember that percentages have to result in whole numbers because you can't have a fraction of a student. So 20% of the total students must be an integer, and similarly, 28% must also be an integer. Let me write that down. Let the total number of students be N. Then, 0.2*N must be an integer, and 0.28*N must also be an integer. \n\nWait, right. So N has to be such that when multiplied by 0.2 and 0.28, both results are whole numbers. Let's think about the prime factors here. 20% is 1/5, so N must be divisible by 5. Because 20% of N is (1/5)*N, so N must be a multiple of 5. \n\nFor 28%, which is 28/100, that simplifies to 7/25. So 28% of N is (7/25)*N. To make that an integer, 25 must divide N. Because 25 times something divided by 25 gives an integer. Wait, let me see.

So 28N divisible by 100 \u2192 (4*7*N) divisible by (4*25) \u2192 7*N divisible by 25. Since 7 and 25 are coprime, N must be divisible by 25.
