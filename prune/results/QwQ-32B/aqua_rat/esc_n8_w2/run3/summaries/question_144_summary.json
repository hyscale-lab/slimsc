      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here about two independent events, A and B. The question is asking for the probability of event B occurring. Let me see what information I have here.\n\nFirst, the problem states that events A and B are independent. That's important because when two events are independent, the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. So, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). That might come in handy later.\n\nThe probability that event A occurs is 0.6. Got that. And the probability that at least one of A or B occurs is 0.96. Hmm, right. The \"at least one\" part makes me think of the formula for the union of two events. The formula for P(A or B) is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since they're independent, I can substitute P(A and B) with P(A)*P(B).\n\nSo putting that together, the equation would be:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B) = 0.96\n\nWe know P(A) is 0.6, so substituting that in:\n\n0.6 + P(B) - 0.6*P(B) = 0.96\n\nLet me write that out step by step. Let me call P(B) as x for simplicity. Then the equation becomes:\n\n0.6 + x - 0.6x = 0.96\n\nSimplifying the left side, the terms with x are x - 0.6x which is 0.4x. So:\n\n0.6 + 0.4x = 0.96\n\nNow, subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.4x = 0.96 - 0.6 = 0.36\n\nThen, solving for x, divide both sides by 0.4:\n\nx = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9\n\nWait, but 0.36 divided by 0.4 is 0.9? Let me check that again. 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36, yes. So that gives x = 0.9, which would be option E.\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Let me verify if I applied the formula correctly. The formula for the union of two events is indeed P(A) + P(B) - their intersection. Since they are independent, the intersection is P(A)P(B). So substituting all that, the equation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it another way. The probability that at least one occurs is 1 minus the probability that neither occurs. So another way to write P(A \u222a B) is 1 - P(not A and not B). Since A and B are independent, are their complements also independent? Yes, I think so. Because if A and B are independent, then the occurrence of A doesn't affect B, so the non-occurrence of A also doesn't affect the non-occurrence of B. So P(not A and not B) = P(not A) * P(not B).\n\nLet me try this approach. So:\n\nP(A \u222a B) = 1 - P(not A) * P(not B) = 0.96\n\nWe know P(not A) is 1 - 0.6 = 0.4. Let P(B) be x again, so P(not B) is 1 - x.\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\n1 - (0.4)(1 - x) = 0.96\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\n-0.4(1 - x) = 0.96 - 1\n\nWhich is:\n\n-0.4(1 - x) = -0.04\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n0.4(1 - x) = 0.04\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4:\n\n1 - x = 0.04 / 0.4 = 0.1\n\nSo 1 - x = 0.1 \u2192 x = 1 - 0.1 = 0.9. Same result as before. So that confirms it. So the probability of B is 0.9, which is option E.\n\nWait a second, but the options include 0.8 as D. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nLet me check the calculation again. Let me go back to the first method.\n\nOriginal equation: 0.6 + x - 0.6x = 0.96\n\nCombine the x terms: x*(1 - 0.6) = x*0.4. So 0.6 + 0.4x = 0.96\n\nSubtract 0.6: 0.4x = 0.36 \u2192 x = 0.36/0.4 = 0.9. That's correct.\n\nHmm, so the answer is E) 0.9. But let me check the options again. The options given are A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9. So yes, E is an option. So that's the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming independence for the complements? Let me think again. If A and B are independent, then the complement of A and B are also independent. The definition of independence is that P(A \u2229 B) = P(A)P(B). Then, P(not A \u2229 not B) = P(not A)P(not B) because the events not A and not B would also be independent. So that part is okay.\n\nHmm, so both approaches lead to 0.9, so I think that's the correct answer. The options have E as 0.9, so that should be the right choice.\n",

Yep, same result. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E. So the correct option is E.\n\n\nTo determine the probability of event B occurring, we use the information that events A and B are independent. The probability of at least one of the events occurring (A \u222a B) is given as 0.96. \n\nFirst, recall the formula for the probability of the union of two independent events:\n\\[\nP(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)\n\\]\nLet \\( P(B) = x \\). Substituting the known values:\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6 \\cdot x)\n\\]\nSimplifying:\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + x(1 - 0.6)\n\\]\n\\[\n0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x\n\\]\nSubtracting 0.6 from both sides:\n\\[\n0.36 = 0.4x\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{0.36}{0.4} = 0.9\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, using the complement approach, the probability that neither A nor B occurs is:\n\\[\n1 - P(A \\cup B) = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04\n\\]\nSince the events are independent, the probability of neither occurring is:\n\\[\n(1 - P(A))(1 - P(B)) = (1 - 0.6)(1 - x) = 0.4(1 - x)\n\\]\nSetting this equal to 0.04:\n\\[\n0.4(1 - x) = 0.04\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\n1 - x = \\frac{0.04}{0.4} = 0.1 \\implies x = 0.9\n\\]\n\nBoth methods confirm that the probability of event B occurring is 0.9.\n\nAnswer: E",
