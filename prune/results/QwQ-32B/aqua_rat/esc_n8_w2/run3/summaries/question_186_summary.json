      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where A can build a wall in 40 minutes and B can do it in 45 minutes. The question is asking how long it would take them if they work together. Hmm, right, this is a classic work-rate problem. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with work rates, the idea is to find out how much each person can do in a unit of time, like per minute, and then add their rates together when working together. \n\nSo, let me start by figuring out the rates for A and B. If A can finish the wall in 40 minutes, then in one minute, A does 1/40 of the wall. Similarly, B's rate would be 1/45 per minute because he takes 45 minutes alone. \n\nSo adding those rates together gives the combined rate. Let me write that down:\n\nA's rate = 1/40 per minute\nB's rate = 1/45 per minute\nCombined rate = (1/40) + (1/45)\n\nHmm, now I need to add these two fractions. To do that, I should find a common denominator. The denominators are 40 and 45. Let's see, the least common multiple of 40 and 45. Well, 40 factors into 2^3 *5, and 45 is 3^2 *5. So the LCM would be 2^3 *3^2 *5 = 8*9*5 = 360. So the common denominator is 360.\n\nConverting both fractions:\n1/40 = 9/360 (since 40*9=360)\n1/45 = 8/360 (since 45*8=360)\nAdding them together gives 9/360 + 8/360 = 17/360 per minute. Wait, wait, 9+8 is 17? Oh right, yes. So combined, they can do 17/360 of the wall each minute.\n\nNow, to find the total time needed to build one wall, we can take the reciprocal of the combined rate. Because rate is work over time, so time is work divided by rate. Since the work is 1 wall, time = 1/(17/360) = 360/17 minutes. Let me compute that. \n\n360 divided by 17. Let's see, 17*21 = 357, because 17*20 is 340, plus 17 is 357. Then 360 - 357 is 3. So 360/17 is 21 and 3/17 minutes. That's approximately 21.176 minutes. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D)21 min. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)20, B)22, C)23, D)21, E)20. Oh, so D is 21. But wait, the exact calculation gives 21.176, which is about 21.18 minutes, so the closest whole minute would be 21. Since the question asks for how many hours? Wait, no, the question says \"how many hours is needed to construct a wall if both are working together.\" Wait, wait a second, the options are all in minutes. The question says \"how many hours\" but the options are in minutes. That must be a typo. Because the options are all in minutes. So maybe the question meant minutes. Let me check again the original problem.\n\nThe question says: \"How many hours is needed to contruct a wall if both the person working together.\" Wait, maybe that's a mistake. The options are all in minutes. So probably the question should be \"how many minutes\". Maybe a translation error. Well, assuming that the options are correct, so the answer should be 360/17, which is approximately 21.176, so 21 minutes would be the closest, so D. \n\nWait, but let me confirm. Let me check the calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake. \n\nA's rate is 1/40, B is 1/45. Adding them: 1/40 + 1/45. Let me compute this again. \n\nThe denominators: 40 and 45. Alternatively, maybe compute the decimal values. \n\n1/40 is 0.025 per minute. 1/45 is approximately 0.022222... So adding them gives 0.047222... per minute. \n\nThen total time is 1 divided by that rate. 1 / 0.047222 \u2248 21.176. So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be approximately 21.18 minutes, so the closest option is D, 21 minutes. \n\nWait, but the options have two 20-minute options. A and E are both 20. Maybe a typo there, but the correct answer is D. Let me check if there's another way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I did something wrong. Let me think of another approach. Suppose the time taken together is T minutes. Then, the work done by A in T minutes is T/40, and by B is T/45. Together, their combined work is T/40 + T/45 = 1 (the whole wall). \n\nSo solving T*(1/40 + 1/45) = 1. That's the same equation as before. So T = 1/(1/40 +1/45) which is the same as 360/17. So same answer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be D)21 min. \n\nSo the options are A)20, B)22, C)23, D)21. So the answer is D. The possible confusion is if someone miscalculates the LCM or adds incorrectly, but I think my steps are correct.\n",
