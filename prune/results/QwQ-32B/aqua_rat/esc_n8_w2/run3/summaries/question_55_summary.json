      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about three painters\u2014Mr. Brown, Mr. Black, and Mr. Blue\u2014who are contracted to paint three houses. Each has different painting speeds. The question is asking how many days Mr. Blue will need to finish the contract after certain conditions are met. Hmm, I need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down the rates of each painter. Since Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, his rate would be 1 house per 6 days, right? So his rate is 1/6 per day. Similarly, Mr. Black takes 8 days, so his rate is 1/8 per day. Mr. Blue takes 12 days, so his rate is 1/12 per day.\n\nThe contract is to paint 3 houses. The problem mentions the timeline: first, Mr. Brown works for 8 days, then Mr. Black works for 6 days, and then Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work. Wait, no, let me read again. Wait, the problem says \"After 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Hmm, so maybe the initial period is 8 days where Mr. Brown was working, then Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. Wait, perhaps I need to figure out how much work each has done in their periods and then see what's left for Mr. Blue.\n\nWait, let me parse the timeline again. The contract is to paint 3 houses. The process is:\n\n1. First, Mr. Brown works for 8 days. Then he goes on vacation. \n\nWait, but who else was working before that? The problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses.\" Are they working together initially, or is each working on their own houses? Hmm, maybe each is working on a separate house? Or perhaps they are working together on the same house? Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the problem says \"paint 3 houses\"\u2014so maybe each is assigned to paint one house? Or maybe they are all working together on all three houses? Hmm, that's unclear. Wait, perhaps the problem is structured so that each painter can work on any house, and they can work together or separately. Wait, the problem might be that each of them paints a house, but the total is three. Wait, maybe each of the three painters is assigned to paint one house, but the problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses\"\u2014so the company has three houses to paint. The three painters are working on these houses, but how exactly?\n\nAlternatively, maybe all three are working together on the three houses. Wait, perhaps each painter is working on a separate house. Wait, perhaps the problem is that each painter is working on their own house. Wait, but the problem says \"paint 3 houses\"\u2014so the total work is three houses. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all three are working together on the three houses, but that might complicate. Wait, maybe each painter's rate is per house. So the problem is about painting three houses, each painter can work on a house, but the question is how much each contributes. Hmm, perhaps the problem is that each painter can work on any house, but the question is about the total work done over time.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that each of them is assigned to paint one house, but the contract is to paint three houses. Wait, but the problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses\"\u2014so the company has to paint three houses. The three painters are working on these. The question is, how much time does each take, and then after some days, some leave, others come, and we need to find the remaining time for Blue to finish the remaining houses.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the three painters are working on the same three houses, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe each painter is working on a separate house. For example, each painter is assigned to paint one house, so the total work is three houses, each to be painted by one person. So Mr. Brown is assigned to one house, Mr. Black another, and Mr. Blue the third. Then the problem says after 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. Wait, but if each is painting their own house, then Mr. Brown would have been painting his house for 8 days, then he stops. Then Mr. Black starts working for 6 days\u2014maybe on Mr. Brown's house? Because otherwise, if each was assigned their own, then Mr. Black's own house would already be under his own work. Hmm, this is confusing. Alternatively, maybe all three are working together on the three houses, so their combined rates add up. Wait, perhaps the problem is that they can work on any of the houses, and the total work required is three houses, so the total work is 3 houses. Let me try to approach this again.\n\nLet me read the question again carefully:\n\n\"A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the three painters are working together on the three houses. Wait, but each painter's rate is per house. So maybe the total work is three houses, and each painter can contribute to the total work. Let me think of the work in terms of \"house-days\" or rates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the company has to paint three houses, and each painter can work on a house, but they can choose which house. But the way the question is phrased, perhaps the problem is that all three painters are working on the same set of houses, and their combined work is being tracked. Alternatively, maybe each painter is working on a different house. Let me see the problem again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that each painter is working on their own house, but the total of three houses. For example, Mr. Brown is painting one house, Mr. Black another, and Mr. Blue the third. Then the total contract is that all three houses must be painted. But then, after 8 days, Mr. Brown stops, so his house is only partially painted. Then Mr. Black starts working for 6 days\u2014 perhaps he takes over Mr. Brown's house? But then the problem says \"begins to work for a period of 6 days\"\u2014so maybe he is working on his own house? But that would mean that after 8 days, Mr. Black was already working on his own house? Wait, maybe the initial setup is that all three are working on their own houses, so each is assigned to one house, and their rates are as given. Then the timeline is: first, for the first 8 days, all three are working on their own houses. Then Mr. Brown goes on vacation, so his house is now being worked on by someone else? But the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the three painters are working in sequence or in some rotation. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the three painters are working on the same three houses, but their rates add up.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that all three are working together on the three houses. Let's see: the total work required is three houses, which would take each painter a certain number of days if they worked alone, but since they work together, their combined rates add up. Wait, but each painter's rate is per house. Hmm, maybe I need to model this as the total work being three houses, and each painter contributes a portion of their work over time. Let me try this approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each painter is working on a separate house. So Mr. Brown is assigned to paint one house, Mr. Black another, and Mr. Blue the third. Each is working on their own house. The contract is to have all three houses painted. Then, after 8 days, Mr. Brown stops working on his house. Then Mr. Black starts working for 6 days\u2014maybe he takes over Mr. Brown's house? Because Mr. Black's own house would already be in progress. But the problem says \"begins to work for a period of 6 days\"\u2014so perhaps he is working on his own house? Wait, but that might not make sense because he was already working on it. Hmm, maybe the problem is structured as follows:\n\nThe company has three houses to paint. Each painter can choose to work on any house, but the problem is tracking how much each contributes over time. Let me try to think in terms of work done.\n\nLet me consider the total work as 3 houses. Each painter's rate is houses per day. For example, Mr. Brown can paint 1 house in 6 days, so his rate is (1/6) houses per day. Similarly, Mr. Black is 1/8 per day, and Blue is 1/12 per day.\n\nThe problem is about how much each contributes over the given periods, and then find how much Blue needs to do.\n\nWait, but the timeline is:\n\nFirst, for some period, Mr. Brown is working. Then after 8 days, he goes on vacation. Then Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. Wait, but when does Mr. Black start? The problem says \"After 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" So perhaps the initial 8 days, Mr. Brown was working alone, then after those 8 days, Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. Wait, but where are the others? Or is there more to the timeline?\n\nWait, the problem might be that the initial setup is that all three were working together? Or maybe the company has the three painters working in sequence? Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the company first has Mr. Brown working alone for 8 days, then after that, Mr. Black works alone for 6 days, and then Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work. That would make sense. Let me try that approach.\n\nWait, the problem says \"A company contracts to paint 3 houses.\" So the total work required is 3 houses. The company has three workers, but maybe the workers are hired in sequence? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the three painters are working on the three houses in some order. Let me think of the problem as the total work being 3 houses. The first 8 days, Mr. Brown is working on painting houses. Then he leaves, and then Mr. Black works for 6 days, and then Mr. Blue must finish the remaining houses. But how much work has each done?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to calculate the total work done by each in their periods, then subtract from 3 to find what's left, then compute how long Blue needs to paint that remainder.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nTotal houses needed: 3.\n\nFirst, Mr. Brown works for 8 days. His rate is 1/6 per day, so in 8 days he paints 8*(1/6) = 8/6 = 4/3 houses.\n\nThen, Mr. Black works for 6 days. His rate is 1/8 per day, so he paints 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 of a house.\n\nTotal work done so far: 4/3 + 3/4. Let me add those fractions. The common denominator is 12. 4/3 is 16/12, 3/4 is 9/12. Total is 25/12 \u2248 2.0833 houses.\n\nThe total needed is 3, so remaining work is 3 - 25/12 = (36/12 -25/12)= 11/12 houses remaining.\n\nNow, Mr. Blue has to paint the remaining 11/12 houses. His rate is 1/12 per day, so time needed is (11/12) divided by (1/12) = 11 days. So the answer would be D)11.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me go through the steps again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, Mr. Brown works for 8 days. His rate is 1 house/6 days, so per day 1/6. 8 days gives 8*(1/6) = 4/3. That's correct.\n\nThen, after that, Mr. Black works for 6 days. His rate is 1/8 per day. 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4. Correct.\n\nTotal work done: 4/3 + 3/4. Let me compute that again. 4/3 is approximately 1.333..., 3/4 is 0.75. Adding gives 2.0833..., which is 25/12. So 3 - 25/12 = 11/12. Correct.\n\nThen, Mr. Blue paints at 1/12 per day. To do 11/12, time is (11/12) / (1/12) = 11 days. So the answer is D)11. That's one of the options. Hmm, but wait, the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Does that mean that after Mr. Brown leaves, Mr. Black starts working for 6 days, and during those 6 days, is Mr. Blue also working? Or is Mr. Black working alone during those 6 days?\n\nAh, this is a critical point. The problem says \"After 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" The way it's phrased might imply that Mr. Black starts working for 6 days after Mr. Brown leaves. But does that mean that during those 6 days, only Mr. Black is working, or are there others? The problem doesn't mention Mr. Blue's involvement until the end. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the company has three workers, but they are working one after another? Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses.\" The three workers have different rates. The timeline is:\n\n- First, Mr. Brown works for 8 days.\n\n- Then, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, so he stops working.\n\n- Then, Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. (So during those 6 days, only Mr. Black is working?)\n\n- After that period, it's Mr. Blue's turn to finish the job. How many days will it take Mr. Blue?\n\nSo the total work done is Brown's contribution (8 days at his rate) plus Black's contribution (6 days at his rate) plus Blue's contribution (x days at his rate), which must equal 3 houses.\n\nWait, in that case, I think my previous calculation is correct. Because the problem states that after the 8 days, Brown is gone, then Black works for 6 days, then Blue has to finish. So Blue's time is separate from the others. So total work is:\n\nWork by Brown (8 days) + Work by Black (6 days) + Work by Blue (x days) = 3 houses.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n(8*(1/6)) + (6*(1/8)) + (x*(1/12)) = 3.\n\nSolving for x:\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n8*(1/6) = 8/6 = 4/3 \u22481.333...\n\n6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 = 0.75\n\nAdding these gives 4/3 + 3/4 = (16/12 +9/12)=25/12 \u22482.0833...\n\nSo:\n\n25/12 + (x/12) = 3\n\nMultiply all terms by 12 to eliminate denominators:\n\n25 + x = 36\n\nThus x = 11. So that's 11 days, which is option D.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that during Black's 6 days, he's working alone. The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Does this mean that after Brown leaves, Black starts, and during those 6 days, is Blue also working? The problem isn't clear on that. The problem might be that the three workers are working in sequence: first Brown alone for 8 days, then Black alone for 6 days, then Blue alone to finish. If that's the case, then the calculation holds. But maybe during those 6 days, both Black and Blue are working together? The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\" \u2014 perhaps that's in addition to Blue? Or perhaps the problem is that after Brown leaves, both Black and Blue are working together for 6 days, and then Blue continues?\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again:\n\n\"After 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nThe wording \"begins to work for a period of 6 days\" might mean that Mr. Black works those 6 days, and then after that, Mr. Blue has to finish. The problem doesn't mention Mr. Blue working during those 6 days, so perhaps during the 6 days, only Mr. Black is working. Then the initial 8 days had only Mr. Brown working. So the total work done before Blue starts is Brown's 8 days plus Black's 6 days. Then Blue has to do the remaining. So the calculation is correct. So the answer should be D)11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the 6 days, both Black and Blue are working? The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work\"\u2014maybe implying that he starts working alongside someone else? But the problem says \"Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" The phrasing could be interpreted as Mr. Black starts working (maybe joining someone else?), but since the problem mentions only Mr. Blue at the end, perhaps the company only has those three workers, and when Brown leaves, Black takes over, but Blue was perhaps not working before?\n\nWait, maybe the initial 8 days had all three working? Wait, the problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses\"\u2014so perhaps the company hires all three to work together? But the problem says \"After 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Hmm, maybe initially, all three were working together for the first 8 days. Wait, but then the problem says \"Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work...\" which is a bit confusing because Black was already working. Alternatively, perhaps the initial 8 days were only Mr. Brown working, and then after that, Mr. Black starts working (maybe along with others? Or alone?)\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be structured as:\n\n- For the first 8 days, only Mr. Brown is painting.\n\n- Then, Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts working alone for 6 days.\n\n- After those 6 days, Mr. Blue must finish the job alone.\n\nIn that case, the calculation I did earlier holds, leading to 11 days (D).\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the 6 days, Mr. Black and Mr. Blue are both working? Let's see what would happen then.\n\nSuppose after Brown leaves, both Black and Blue work together for 6 days. Then the work done during those 6 days would be (Black's rate + Blue's rate) *6 days. Then Blue would have to finish the remaining work alone. Let me try that scenario:\n\nTotal work needed: 3 houses.\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown paints alone: 8*(1/6) = 4/3.\n\nThen next 6 days: Black and Blue working together. Their combined rate is (1/8 +1/12). Let's compute that:\n\n1/8 +1/12 = (3/24 + 2/24)=5/24 per day.\n\nOver 6 days: 6*(5/24)=30/24 = 5/4 = 1.25.\n\nTotal after 8+6 days: 4/3 +5/4 = (16/12 +15/12)=31/12 \u22482.5833...\n\nRemaining work: 3 -31/12 = (36/12 -31/12)=5/12.\n\nThen Blue's rate is 1/12 per day. Time needed: (5/12)/(1/12)=5 days. But 5 isn't an option. So that scenario would give an answer not listed, so probably that's not the case.\n\nHence, the problem likely intends that only one painter works at a time, sequentially. So first Brown for 8 days, then Black for 6 days, then Blue for x days. Thus, the correct calculation leads to 11 days, which is option D. So I think the answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many days Mr. Blue will take to complete the contract, we first calculate the work done by each painter during their respective periods:\n\n1. **Mr. Brown's Contribution**:  \n   He works for 8 days at a rate of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) houses per day.  \n   Work done: \\( 8 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3} \\) houses.\n\n2. **Mr. Black's Contribution**:  \n   He works for 6 days at a rate of \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) houses per day.  \n   Work done: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} \\) houses.\n\n3. **Total Work Done Before Mr. Blue Starts**:  \n   Summing their contributions:  \n   \\( \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{16}{12} + \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{25}{12} \\) houses.\n\n4. **Remaining Work**:  \n   Total required: 3 houses.  \n   Remaining work: \\( 3 - \\frac{25}{12} = \\frac{36}{12} - \\frac{25}{12} = \\frac{11}{12} \\) houses.\n\n5. **Mr. Blue's Time to Complete Remaining Work**:  \n   Mr. Blue's rate is \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) houses per day.  \n   Time required: \\( \\frac{\\frac{11}{12}}{\\frac{1}{12}} = 11 \\) days.\n\nThus, the answer is **D)11**.\n\nAnswer: D",

Similarly, Mr. Black is 1/8 per day, and Blue is 1/12 per day.\n\nThe problem is about how much each contributes over the given periods, and then find how much Blue needs to do.\n\nWait, but the timeline is:\n\nFirst, for some period, Mr. Brown is working. Then after 8 days, he goes on vacation. Then Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. Wait, but when does Mr. Black start? The problem says \"After 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" So perhaps the initial 8 days, Mr. Brown was working alone, then after those 8 days, Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. Wait, but where are the others? Or is there more to the timeline?\n\nWait, the problem might be that the initial setup is that all three were working together? Or maybe the company has the three painters working in sequence? Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the company first has Mr. Brown working alone for 8 days, then after that, Mr. Black works alone for 6 days, and then Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work. That would make sense. Let me try that approach.\n\nWait, the problem says \"A company contracts to paint 3 houses.\" So the total work required is 3 houses. The company has three workers, but maybe the workers are hired in sequence? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the three painters are working on the three houses in some order. Let me think of the problem as the total work being 3 houses. The first 8 days, Mr. Brown is working on painting houses. Then he leaves, and then Mr. Black works for 6 days, and then Mr. Blue must finish the remaining houses. But how much work has each done?\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to calculate the total work done by each in their periods, then subtract from 3 to find what's left, then compute how long Blue needs to paint that remainder.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nTotal houses needed: 3.\n\nFirst, Mr. Brown works for 8 days. His rate is 1/6 per day, so in 8 days he paints 8*(1/6) = 8/6 = 4/3 houses.\n\nThen, Mr. Black works for 6 days. His rate is 1/8 per day, so he paints 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 of a house.\n\nTotal work done so far: 4/3 + 3/4. Let me add those fractions. The common denominator is 12. 4/3 is 16/12, 3/4 is 9/12. Total is 25/12 \u2248 2.0833 houses.\n\nThe total needed is 3, so remaining work is 3 - 25/12 = (36/12 -25/12)= 11/12 houses remaining.\n\nNow, Mr. Blue has to paint the remaining 11/12 houses. His rate is 1/12 per day, so time needed is (11/12) divided by (1/12) = 11 days. So the answer would be D)11.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me go through the steps again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, Mr. Brown works for 8 days. His rate is 1 house/6 days, so per day 1/6. 8 days gives 8*(1/6) = 4/3. That's correct.\n\nThen, after that, Mr. Black works for 6 days. His rate is 1/8 per day. 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4. Correct.\n\nTotal work done: 4/3 + 3/4. Let me compute that again. 4/3 is approximately 1.333..., 3/4 is 0.75. Adding gives 2.0833..., which is 25/12. So 3 - 25/12 = 11/12. Correct.\n\nThen, Mr. Blue paints at 1/12 per day. To do 11/12, time is (11/12) / (1/12) = 11 days. So the answer is D)11. That's one of the options. Hmm, but wait, the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Does that mean that after Mr. Brown leaves, Mr. Black starts working for 6 days, and during those 6 days, is Mr. Blue also working? Or is Mr. Black working alone during those 6 days?\n\nAh, this is a critical point. The problem says \"After 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" The way it's phrased might imply that Mr. Black starts working for 6 days after Mr. Brown leaves. But does that mean that during those 6 days, only Mr. Black is working, or are there others? The problem doesn't mention Mr. Blue's involvement until the end. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the company has three workers, but they are working one after another? Let me re-examine the question.\n\nThe problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses.\" The three workers have different rates. The timeline is:\n\n- First, Mr. Brown works for 8 days.\n\n- Then, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, so he stops working.\n\n- Then, Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. (So during those 6 days, only Mr. Black is working?)\n\n- After that period, it's Mr. Blue's turn to finish the job. How many days will it take Mr. Blue?\n\nSo the total work done is Brown's contribution (8 days at his rate) plus Black's contribution (6 days at his rate) plus Blue's contribution (x days at his rate), which must equal 3 houses.\n\nWait, in that case, I think my previous calculation is correct. Because the problem states that after the 8 days, Brown is gone, then Black works for 6 days, then Blue has to finish. So Blue's time is separate from the others. So total work is:\n\nWork by Brown (8 days) + Work by Black (6 days) + Work by Blue (x days) = 3 houses.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n(8*(1/6)) + (6*(1/8)) + (x*(1/12)) = 3.\n\nSolving for x:\n\nCalculate each term:\n\n8*(1/6) = 8/6 = 4/3 \u22481.333...\n\n6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 = 0.75\n\nAdding these gives 4/3 + 3/4 = (16/12 +9/12)=25/12 \u22482.0833...\n\nSo:\n\n25/12 + (x/12) = 3\n\nMultiply all terms by 12 to eliminate denominators:\n\n25 + x = 36\n\nThus x = 11. So that's 11 days, which is option D.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that during Black's 6 days, he's working alone. The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Does this mean that after Brown leaves, Black starts, and during those 6 days, is Blue also working? The problem isn't clear on that. The problem might be that the three workers are working in sequence: first Brown alone for 8 days, then Black alone for 6 days, then Blue alone to finish. If that's the case, then the calculation holds. But maybe during those 6 days, both Black and Blue are working together? The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\" \u2014 perhaps that's in addition to Blue? Or perhaps the problem is that after Brown leaves, both Black and Blue are working together for 6 days, and then Blue continues?\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again:\n\n\"After 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nThe wording \"begins to work for a period of 6 days\" might mean that Mr. Black works those 6 days, and then after that, Mr. Blue has to finish. The problem doesn't mention Mr. Blue working during those 6 days, so perhaps during the 6 days, only Mr. Black is working. Then the initial 8 days had only Mr. Brown working. So the total work done before Blue starts is Brown's 8 days plus Black's 6 days. Then Blue has to do the remaining. So the calculation is correct. So the answer should be D)11.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the 6 days, both Black and Blue are working? The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work\"\u2014maybe implying that he starts working alongside someone else? But the problem says \"Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" The phrasing could be interpreted as Mr. Black starts working (maybe joining someone else?), but since the problem mentions only Mr. Blue at the end, perhaps the company only has those three workers, and when Brown leaves, Black takes over, but Blue was perhaps not working before?\n\nWait, maybe the initial 8 days had all three working? Wait, the problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses\"\u2014so perhaps the company hires all three to work together? But the problem says \"After 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Hmm, maybe initially, all three were working together for the first 8 days. Wait, but then the problem says \"Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work...\" which is a bit confusing because Black was already working. Alternatively, perhaps the initial 8 days were only Mr. Brown working, and then after that, Mr. Black starts working (maybe along with others? Or alone?)\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be structured as:\n\n- For the first 8 days, only Mr. Brown is painting.\n\n- Then, Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts working alone for 6 days.\n\n- After those 6 days, Mr. Blue must finish the job alone.\n\nIn that case, the calculation I did earlier holds, leading to 11 days (D).\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the 6 days, Mr. Black and Mr. Blue are both working? Let's see what would happen then.\n\nSuppose after Brown leaves, both Black and Blue work together for 6 days. Then the work done during those 6 days would be (Black's rate + Blue's rate) *6 days. Then Blue would have to finish the remaining work alone. Let me try that scenario:\n\nTotal work needed: 3 houses.\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown paints alone: 8*(1/6) = 4/3.\n\nThen next 6 days: Black and Blue working together. Their combined rate is (1/8 +1/12). Let's compute that:\n\n1/8 +1/12 = (3/24 + 2/24)=5/24 per day.\n\nOver 6 days: 6*(5/24)=30/24 = 5/4 = 1.25.\n\nTotal after 8+6 days: 4/3 +5/4 = (16/12 +15/12)=31/12 \u22482.5833...\n\nRemaining work: 3 -31/12 = (36/12 -31/12)=5/12.\n\nThen Blue's rate is 1/12 per day. Time needed: (5/12)/(1/12)=5 days. But 5 isn't an option. So that scenario would give an answer not listed, so probably that's not the case.\n\nHence, the problem likely intends that only one painter works at a time, sequentially. So first Brown for 8 days, then Black for 6 days, then Blue for x days. Thus, the correct calculation leads to 11 days, which is option D. So I think the answer is D.\n\n\nTo determine how many days Mr. Blue will take to complete the contract, we first calculate the work done by each painter during their respective periods:\n\n1. **Mr. Brown's Contribution**:  \n   He works for 8 days at a rate of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) houses per day.  \n   Work done: \\( 8 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3} \\) houses.\n\n2. **Mr. Black's Contribution**:  \n   He works for 6 days at a rate of \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) houses per day.  \n   Work done: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} \\) houses.\n\n3. **Total Work Done Before Mr. Blue Starts**:  \n   Summing their contributions:  \n   \\( \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{16}{12} + \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{25}{12} \\) houses.\n\n4. **Remaining Work**:  \n   Total required: 3 houses.  \n   Remaining work: \\( 3 - \\frac{25}{12} = \\frac{36}{12} - \\frac{25}{12} = \\frac{11}{12} \\) houses.\n\n5. **Mr. Blue's Time to Complete Remaining Work**:  \n   Mr. Blue's rate is \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) houses per day.  \n   Time required: \\( \\frac{\\frac{11}{12}}{\\frac{1}{12}} = 11 \\) days.\n\nThus, the answer is **D)11**.\n\nAnswer: D",

Hmm, the problem says they have to paint 3 houses. \n\nFirst, I think I should calculate the rates at which each person paints. Like, how much of a house each can paint per day. \n\nMr. Brown can do a house in 6 days, so his rate is 1/6 per day. Mr. Black takes 8 days, so his rate is 1/8 per day.

Let me parse the timeline:\n\nFirst, there's an initial period of 8 days where Mr. Brown is working. Then, after those 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. Then, Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. Wait, but who is working during those 8 days? The problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses\"\u2014so maybe all three are working together initially? Or maybe only one person at a time?\n\nWait, the problem isn't entirely clear. Let me think again. The problem says: \"After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Hmm, perhaps the initial 8 days, Mr. Brown was the one working on the houses, and then Mr. Black starts working for 6 days.

But the problem states that the company has to paint 3 houses, so maybe each painter is assigned a house? Or they work together on the same houses?\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think of possible interpretations and see which makes sense.\n\nLet me try the first interpretation: \n\nSuppose that all three are working together for the first 8 days. Then Mr. Brown leaves, so only Mr. Black and Mr. Blue continue? But the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Wait, perhaps after the first 8 days, Mr. Brown is no longer working, and Mr. Black starts working (but maybe he was not working before?) for 6 days. Then, after that, Mr. Blue must finish the remaining work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 8 days, only Mr. Brown was working. Then, after that, Mr. Black starts working (for 6 days, but maybe alongside others?), and then Blue takes over. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured as follows:\n\nThe company has to paint 3 houses. The work is done in stages. \n\nFirst stage: Mr. Brown works alone for 8 days. \n\nSecond stage: After that, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. So now, Mr. Black starts working, but only for 6 days. \n\nThird stage: After those 6 days of Mr. Black working (alone?), Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work. \n\nBut then, how much work is left?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\" So the total work is 3 houses. \n\nLet me try this approach step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate how much each painter can do per day.\n\nMr. Brown: 1 house in 6 days \u2192 rate = 1/6 per day.\n\nMr. Black: 1/8 per day.\n\nMr. Blue: 1/12 per day.\n\nNow, first 8 days: Mr. Brown is working alone. So in 8 days, he paints 8*(1/6) = 8/6 = 4/3 houses. \n\nWait, but 4/3 is more than one house. Since there are three houses to paint, maybe that's okay, but the total needed is three. \n\nThen, after those 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. Now, Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. So during those 6 days, Mr. Black is working alone? Because the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" So perhaps he is now working alone, not with anyone else. \n\nSo in those 6 days, he paints 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 of a house. \n\nSo total painted so far: 4/3 + 3/4. Let me compute that. \n\n4/3 is 1.333..., 3/4 is 0.75. Adding them gives 2.083... So total 17/6 + 3/4? Wait, better to use fractions:\n\n4/3 + 3/4 = (16/12 + 9/12) = 25/12 \u2248 2.0833 houses painted so far. \n\nThe total needed is 3, so remaining work is 3 - 25/12 = (36/12 -25/12) = 11/12 of a house left. \n\nWait, but the question is asking how many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract. So the remaining work is 11/12 of a house, and Mr. Blue's rate is 1/12 per day. \n\nSo time needed is (11/12) / (1/12) = 11 days. \n\nHmm, that would be option D. But let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly. \n\nWait a second. The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Does that mean that after Mr. Brown leaves, Mr. Black starts working, but maybe alongside someone else? Like, maybe Mr. Blue was already working? \n\nAlternatively, maybe during the first 8 days, all three were working together? That would change the calculation. Let me check that possibility.\n\nAlternative interpretation:\n\nThe initial 8 days: All three are working together. \n\nThen, after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves. Then, Mr. Black works for 6 days (maybe with someone else?), and then Mr. Blue has to finish. \n\nBut the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" If they were already working, then \"begins to work\" might not make sense. So maybe the first scenario is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first 8 days, only Brown is working, then after that, Black starts working (alone) for 6 days, and then Blue takes over. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses\"\u2014so maybe each painter is working on their own house? Like, each is assigned a house to paint. But then the problem says \"how many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract\"\u2014so maybe Blue has to finish all remaining houses? \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the three painters are working on the same houses, so their rates add up when working together. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of the total work as 3 houses, each house being one unit. The company is to paint all three. \n\nLet me try the first interpretation again where each stage is sequential. \n\nFirst 8 days: Only Mr. Brown is working. \n\nThen 6 days: Only Mr. Black is working. \n\nThen the remaining work is done by Mr. Blue. \n\nCalculations as before:\n\nAfter 8 days of Brown: 8*(1/6) = 4/3 houses. \n\nThen 6 days of Black: 6*(1/8) = 3/4. \n\nTotal so far: 4/3 + 3/4 = (16 +9)/12 = 25/12 \u2248 2.083 houses. \n\nRemaining: 3 -25/12 = (36 -25)/12 =11/12. \n\nTime for Blue: (11/12) / (1/12) =11 days. So answer D. \n\nBut let me check another possible interpretation where during the first 8 days, all three are working together. \n\nFirst 8 days: All three working together. \n\nTheir combined rate is (1/6 +1/8 +1/12) per day. Let's compute that. \n\nFind a common denominator, 24:\n\n1/6 =4/24, 1/8=3/24, 1/12=2/24. Sum: 4+3+2=9/24 = 3/8 per day. \n\nSo in 8 days, they paint 8*(3/8)=3 houses. Wait, but then the total would be done in 8 days. But the problem says after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, then Black works for 6 days. Then, if all three had already finished in 8 days, then the problem's question would be different. So that can't be. Therefore, this interpretation must be wrong. \n\nTherefore, the first interpretation is correct where only Brown works first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first 8 days, Brown and Black are working together? Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem's wording is that after 8 days, Brown goes on vacation, and then Mr. Black starts working (perhaps he wasn't working before?) for 6 days. \n\nIf that's the case, then before the 8 days, who was working? Maybe only Brown? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial period is that all three were working, but after 8 days, Brown leaves, and then for the next 6 days, only Black and Blue are working? Then after that, Blue has to finish. \n\nHmm, but the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\". If he was already working, then \"begins\" might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the company started with Brown, and after 8 days, they replace Brown with Black for 6 days, and then Blue takes over. \n\nThis would make sense. Let me proceed with that. \n\nSo first 8 days: Brown works alone. \n\nThen next 6 days: Black works alone. \n\nThen Blue must finish the remaining. \n\nSo total work done after 8+6=14 days is:\n\nBrown: 8*(1/6) = 4/3.\n\nBlack: 6*(1/8)= 3/4. \n\nTotal: 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 \u22482.083 houses. \n\nRemaining: 3 -25/12 =11/12. \n\nTime for Blue: 11/12 divided by 1/12 per day is 11 days. So answer D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe during the first 8 days, both Brown and Black were working? Let's check that scenario. \n\nFirst 8 days: Brown and Black working together. \n\nTheir combined rate is 1/6 +1/8 = (4+3)/24 =7/24 per day. \n\nIn 8 days, they paint 8*(7/24)=56/24 = 2.333... houses (7/3). \n\nThen after that, Brown goes on vacation. Then, Mr. Black works for another 6 days (but alone now?), so his rate is 1/8 per day. \n\n6 days *1/8 = 6/8 = 0.75. Total painted so far: 7/3 + 3/4 = (28/12 +9/12)=37/12 \u22483.083. That's over 3, so the contract is already done. Which can't be. \n\nSo that's impossible. So that scenario is invalid. \n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the first 8 days, Brown and Blue are working? Let me see. \n\nFirst 8 days: Brown and Blue. Their combined rate is 1/6 +1/12 = (2+1)/12 = 3/12 =1/4 per day. \n\nIn 8 days: 8*(1/4)=2 houses. \n\nThen Brown leaves. Then Black works for 6 days: 6*(1/8)=0.75. \n\nTotal so far: 2.75. Remaining: 0.25. \n\nThen Blue would take 0.25/(1/12)= 3 days. But that's not an option here. The options don't have 3. So that's not the case. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first 8 days, all three are working, but the problem says \"after 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Wait, perhaps after the first 8 days, Mr. Black starts working, but maybe he was not working before? So the initial 8 days had only Brown and Blue working? \n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. The key is probably the first interpretation where the first 8 days are Brown alone, then 6 days Black alone, then Blue. \n\nSo the calculation gives 11 days. Which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the three painters are working on different houses. Like, each is assigned one house? The problem says \"paint 3 houses.\" Maybe each painter is assigned a house. So the total contract is to have all three houses painted. \n\nIn that case, perhaps:\n\nMr. Brown is painting one house, which would take him 6 days. But if he works on it for 8 days, he would finish it early. \n\nWait, but maybe each painter can work on any house. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is that all three are working on the same house? But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, each painter works on their own house. So the three houses are each being painted by one painter. \n\nSuppose:\n\nHouse 1 is assigned to Brown. He can paint it in 6 days. \n\nHouse 2 to Black (8 days). \n\nHouse 3 to Blue (12 days). \n\nThen, the company's contract is to have all three houses done. \n\nThe problem says, after 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. \n\nSo after 8 days, how much has each done? \n\nBrown was working on his house for 8 days. Since his rate is 1/6 per day, after 6 days he would have finished it. So after 8 days, he's already done. \n\nHouse 1 is done. \n\nHouse 2: Mr. Black was working on it, but if he was assigned to his own house, then he takes 8 days total. So after 8 days, he has finished his house. \n\nHouse 3: Mr. Blue was working on it, so after 8 days, he has painted 8*(1/12)= 2/3 of the third house. \n\nThen, after 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation (but he's done with his house anyway). Then, the problem says Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. Wait, but he already finished his own house. So maybe he can help on Blue's house? \n\nHmm, this interpretation could be possible. Let's see:\n\nAfter 8 days, the status:\n\nHouse 1: done by Brown (since he took 6 days, so by day 6, done. So after 8 days, done).\n\nHouse 2: done by Black (since he took 8 days, so exactly done on day 8).\n\nHouse 3: Blue has worked 8 days, so 8/12 = 2/3 done. \n\nNow, Mr. Black is available again (since he finished his house) and starts to help on the third house for 6 days. \n\nSo during those 6 days, Black and Blue are working on the third house. \n\nBlack's rate is 1/8 per day, Blue is 1/12. \n\nCombined rate: 1/8 +1/12 = (3+2)/24=5/24 per day. \n\nThey work for 6 days: 6*(5/24) = 30/24 = 5/4. \n\nWait, but the remaining work on the third house was 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. \n\nWait, that's conflicting. Let me recalculate:\n\nOriginal third house: after 8 days, Blue had done 2/3. So remaining is 1/3. \n\nIf they work together for 6 days, the work done would be (5/24)*6 = 30/24 = 1.25. But that's more than the remaining 1/3. So this would mean the house is overpainted. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the 8 days, the third house needs 1/3 more. \n\nThe combined rate of Black and Blue is 1/8 +1/12 = 5/24 per day. \n\nTime needed to finish 1/3:\n\n(1/3) / (5/24) = (1/3)*(24/5) = 8/5 = 1.6 days. \n\nBut the problem says Mr. Black works for 6 days. So that would mean the work is finished in 1.6 days, but he works 6, so there's some over. But the problem says \"how many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\" \n\nThis is getting too complicated, and the options don't have fractions, so maybe this interpretation is wrong. \n\nTherefore, going back to the first approach where the total work is 3 houses, and each painter is working on any of them, not assigned. \n\nThe first interpretation where the work is done sequentially by each painter. \n\nSo, the total work is 3 houses. \n\nFirst 8 days: Mr. Brown paints alone. \n\nHe paints 8*(1/6) = 4/3 houses. \n\nThen next 6 days: Mr. Black paints alone. \n\n6*(1/8) = 3/4. \n\nTotal done: 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 \u22482.083. \n\nRemaining: 3 -25/12 =11/12. \n\nMr. Blue paints at 1/12 per day, so 11/12 divided by 1/12 is 11 days. \n\nWhich is option D. \n\nSo I think that's the correct answer.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many days Mr. Blue will take to complete the contract after the other two have worked. Hmm, the problem says they have to paint 3 houses. \n\nFirst, I think I should calculate the rates at which each person paints. Like, how much of a house each can paint per day. \n\nMr. Brown can do a house in 6 days, so his rate is 1/6 per day. Mr. Black takes 8 days, so his rate is 1/8 per day. Mr. Blue is 1/12 per day. \n\nWait, but the question is about three houses. So maybe I need to track the total work done over time. Let me think step by step. \n\nThe problem says the contract is to paint three houses. The process is: first, they start working together? Wait, no, maybe not. Wait, the problem says \"After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Wait, maybe I need to parse the timeline correctly. \n\nWait, the question says: the company contracts to paint 3 houses. The workers are Mr. Brown, Black, and Blue. But how are they working? Are they working together at different times?\n\nLet me read the question again carefully. \n\n\"A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nHmm. The wording is a bit tricky. Let me parse the timeline:\n\nFirst, there's an initial period of 8 days where Mr. Brown is working. Then, after those 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. Then, Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. Wait, but who is working during those 8 days? The problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses\"\u2014so maybe all three are working together initially? Or maybe only one person at a time?\n\nWait, the problem isn't entirely clear. Let me think again. The problem says: \"After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Hmm, perhaps the initial 8 days, Mr. Brown was the one working on the houses, and then Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. But then, after that, Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work. Wait, but maybe all three were working in some combination?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial 8 days, all three were working together? But the problem states \"After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Wait, perhaps the first 8 days, Mr. Brown is working alone, then after that, Mr. Black starts working for 6 days, and then Mr. Blue takes over? But that might not be the case. Wait, maybe the initial 8 days, Mr. Brown was working on his own, then Mr. Black starts working for 6 days (possibly alongside others?), but the question is a bit ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first 8 days, all three are working together? But the problem says \"Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Wait, maybe after the first 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts working, but for 6 days. But then, after those 6 days, Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured as follows:\n\nFirst, for 8 days, Mr. Brown is working on painting houses. Then, after those 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. Then, Mr. Black starts to work, but only for 6 days. After those 6 days, Mr. Blue must finish the job. \n\nWait, but that would mean the total work done is by Brown for 8 days, Black for 6 days, and Blue for some days. But the problem says \"how many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\" So maybe the total work is 3 houses, and the remaining after Brown and Black's contributions must be done by Blue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the company has a team working, but the problem's wording is a bit unclear. Let me try to parse the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \n\n\"A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the sequence is:\n\n- The company starts working on the contract. Initially, perhaps all three are working? Or maybe only one?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured as:\n\nInitially, Mr. Brown is working on painting the houses. He works for 8 days. Then he goes on vacation. Then, Mr. Black starts working, but only for 6 days. After that, Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work. Wait, but that would mean that the total work is done by each in sequence? Or maybe they are working together at some points?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that all three are working together for the first 8 days. Then, after those 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, so only Black and Blue work? But the problem says Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. Wait, perhaps after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, and then Mr. Black starts working (maybe alone?) for 6 days, and then Blue has to finish the remaining work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the company has a team where each person works on their own house. But the problem states that the company has to paint 3 houses, so maybe each painter is assigned a house? Or they work together on the same houses?\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think of possible interpretations and see which makes sense.\n\nLet me try the first interpretation: \n\nSuppose that all three are working together for the first 8 days. Then Mr. Brown leaves, so only Mr. Black and Mr. Blue continue? But the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Wait, perhaps after the first 8 days, Mr. Brown is no longer working, and Mr. Black starts working (but maybe he was not working before?) for 6 days. Then, after that, Mr. Blue must finish the remaining work. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 8 days, only Mr. Brown was working. Then, after that, Mr. Black starts working (for 6 days, but maybe alongside others?), and then Blue takes over. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured as follows:\n\nThe company has to paint 3 houses. The work is done in stages. \n\nFirst stage: Mr. Brown works alone for 8 days. \n\nSecond stage: After that, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. So now, Mr. Black starts working, but only for 6 days. \n\nThird stage: After those 6 days of Mr. Black working (alone?), Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work. \n\nBut then, how much work is left?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\" So the total work is 3 houses. \n\nLet me try this approach step by step.\n\nFirst, calculate how much each painter can do per day.\n\nMr. Brown: 1 house in 6 days \u2192 rate = 1/6 per day.\n\nMr. Black: 1/8 per day.\n\nMr. Blue: 1/12 per day.\n\nNow, first 8 days: Mr. Brown is working alone. So in 8 days, he paints 8*(1/6) = 8/6 = 4/3 houses. \n\nWait, but 4/3 is more than one house. Since there are three houses to paint, maybe that's okay, but the total needed is three. \n\nThen, after those 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. Now, Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. So during those 6 days, Mr. Black is working alone? Because the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" So perhaps he is now working alone, not with anyone else. \n\nSo in those 6 days, he paints 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 of a house. \n\nSo total painted so far: 4/3 + 3/4. Let me compute that. \n\n4/3 is 1.333..., 3/4 is 0.75. Adding them gives 2.083... So total 17/6 + 3/4? Wait, better to use fractions:\n\n4/3 + 3/4 = (16/12 + 9/12) = 25/12 \u2248 2.0833 houses painted so far. \n\nThe total needed is 3, so remaining work is 3 - 25/12 = (36/12 -25/12) = 11/12 of a house left. \n\nWait, but the question is asking how many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract. So the remaining work is 11/12 of a house, and Mr. Blue's rate is 1/12 per day. \n\nSo time needed is (11/12) / (1/12) = 11 days. \n\nHmm, that would be option D. But let me check if I interpreted the problem correctly. \n\nWait a second. The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Does that mean that after Mr. Brown leaves, Mr. Black starts working, but maybe alongside someone else? Like, maybe Mr. Blue was already working? \n\nAlternatively, maybe during the first 8 days, all three were working together? That would change the calculation. Let me check that possibility.\n\nAlternative interpretation:\n\nThe initial 8 days: All three are working together. \n\nThen, after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves. Then, Mr. Black works for 6 days (maybe with someone else?), and then Mr. Blue has to finish. \n\nBut the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" If they were already working, then \"begins to work\" might not make sense. So maybe the first scenario is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first 8 days, only Brown is working, then after that, Black starts working (alone) for 6 days, and then Blue takes over. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses\"\u2014so maybe each painter is working on their own house? Like, each is assigned a house to paint. But then the problem says \"how many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract\"\u2014so maybe Blue has to finish all remaining houses? \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the three painters are working on the same houses, so their rates add up when working together. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to think of the total work as 3 houses, each house being one unit. The company is to paint all three. \n\nLet me try the first interpretation again where each stage is sequential. \n\nFirst 8 days: Only Mr. Brown is working. \n\nThen 6 days: Only Mr. Black is working. \n\nThen the remaining work is done by Mr. Blue. \n\nCalculations as before:\n\nAfter 8 days of Brown: 8*(1/6) = 4/3 houses. \n\nThen 6 days of Black: 6*(1/8) = 3/4. \n\nTotal so far: 4/3 + 3/4 = (16 +9)/12 = 25/12 \u2248 2.083 houses. \n\nRemaining: 3 -25/12 = (36 -25)/12 =11/12. \n\nTime for Blue: (11/12) / (1/12) =11 days. So answer D. \n\nBut let me check another possible interpretation where during the first 8 days, all three are working together. \n\nFirst 8 days: All three working together. \n\nTheir combined rate is (1/6 +1/8 +1/12) per day. Let's compute that. \n\nFind a common denominator, 24:\n\n1/6 =4/24, 1/8=3/24, 1/12=2/24. Sum: 4+3+2=9/24 = 3/8 per day. \n\nSo in 8 days, they paint 8*(3/8)=3 houses. Wait, but then the total would be done in 8 days. But the problem says after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, then Black works for 6 days. Then, if all three had already finished in 8 days, then the problem's question would be different. So that can't be. Therefore, this interpretation must be wrong. \n\nTherefore, the first interpretation is correct where only Brown works first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first 8 days, Brown and Black are working together? Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem's wording is that after 8 days, Brown goes on vacation, and then Mr. Black starts working (perhaps he wasn't working before?) for 6 days. \n\nIf that's the case, then before the 8 days, who was working? Maybe only Brown? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the initial period is that all three were working, but after 8 days, Brown leaves, and then for the next 6 days, only Black and Blue are working? Then after that, Blue has to finish. \n\nHmm, but the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\". If he was already working, then \"begins\" might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the company started with Brown, and after 8 days, they replace Brown with Black for 6 days, and then Blue takes over. \n\nThis would make sense. Let me proceed with that. \n\nSo first 8 days: Brown works alone. \n\nThen next 6 days: Black works alone. \n\nThen Blue must finish the remaining. \n\nSo total work done after 8+6=14 days is:\n\nBrown: 8*(1/6) = 4/3.\n\nBlack: 6*(1/8)= 3/4. \n\nTotal: 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 \u22482.083 houses. \n\nRemaining: 3 -25/12 =11/12. \n\nTime for Blue: 11/12 divided by 1/12 per day is 11 days. So answer D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe during the first 8 days, both Brown and Black were working? Let's check that scenario. \n\nFirst 8 days: Brown and Black working together. \n\nTheir combined rate is 1/6 +1/8 = (4+3)/24 =7/24 per day. \n\nIn 8 days, they paint 8*(7/24)=56/24 = 2.333... houses (7/3). \n\nThen after that, Brown goes on vacation. Then, Mr. Black works for another 6 days (but alone now?), so his rate is 1/8 per day. \n\n6 days *1/8 = 6/8 = 0.75. Total painted so far: 7/3 + 3/4 = (28/12 +9/12)=37/12 \u22483.083. That's over 3, so the contract is already done. Which can't be. \n\nSo that's impossible. So that scenario is invalid. \n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the first 8 days, Brown and Blue are working? Let me see. \n\nFirst 8 days: Brown and Blue. Their combined rate is 1/6 +1/12 = (2+1)/12 = 3/12 =1/4 per day. \n\nIn 8 days: 8*(1/4)=2 houses. \n\nThen Brown leaves. Then Black works for 6 days: 6*(1/8)=0.75. \n\nTotal so far: 2.75. Remaining: 0.25. \n\nThen Blue would take 0.25/(1/12)= 3 days. But that's not an option here. The options don't have 3. So that's not the case. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first 8 days, all three are working, but the problem says \"after 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Wait, perhaps after the first 8 days, Mr. Black starts working, but maybe he was not working before? So the initial 8 days had only Brown and Blue working? \n\nWait, this is getting too convoluted. The key is probably the first interpretation where the first 8 days are Brown alone, then 6 days Black alone, then Blue. \n\nSo the calculation gives 11 days. Which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the three painters are working on different houses. Like, each is assigned one house? The problem says \"paint 3 houses.\" Maybe each painter is assigned a house. So the total contract is to have all three houses painted. \n\nIn that case, perhaps:\n\nMr. Brown is painting one house, which would take him 6 days. But if he works on it for 8 days, he would finish it early. \n\nWait, but maybe each painter can work on any house. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is that all three are working on the same house? But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, each painter works on their own house. So the three houses are each being painted by one painter. \n\nSuppose:\n\nHouse 1 is assigned to Brown. He can paint it in 6 days. \n\nHouse 2 to Black (8 days). \n\nHouse 3 to Blue (12 days). \n\nThen, the company's contract is to have all three houses done. \n\nThe problem says, after 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. \n\nSo after 8 days, how much has each done? \n\nBrown was working on his house for 8 days. Since his rate is 1/6 per day, after 6 days he would have finished it. So after 8 days, he's already done. \n\nHouse 1 is done. \n\nHouse 2: Mr. Black was working on it, but if he was assigned to his own house, then he takes 8 days total. So after 8 days, he has finished his house. \n\nHouse 3: Mr. Blue was working on it, so after 8 days, he has painted 8*(1/12)= 2/3 of the third house. \n\nThen, after 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation (but he's done with his house anyway). Then, the problem says Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. Wait, but he already finished his own house. So maybe he can help on Blue's house? \n\nHmm, this interpretation could be possible. Let's see:\n\nAfter 8 days, the status:\n\nHouse 1: done by Brown (since he took 6 days, so by day 6, done. So after 8 days, done).\n\nHouse 2: done by Black (since he took 8 days, so exactly done on day 8).\n\nHouse 3: Blue has worked 8 days, so 8/12 = 2/3 done. \n\nNow, Mr. Black is available again (since he finished his house) and starts to help on the third house for 6 days. \n\nSo during those 6 days, Black and Blue are working on the third house. \n\nBlack's rate is 1/8 per day, Blue is 1/12. \n\nCombined rate: 1/8 +1/12 = (3+2)/24=5/24 per day. \n\nThey work for 6 days: 6*(5/24) = 30/24 = 5/4. \n\nWait, but the remaining work on the third house was 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. \n\nWait, that's conflicting. Let me recalculate:\n\nOriginal third house: after 8 days, Blue had done 2/3. So remaining is 1/3. \n\nIf they work together for 6 days, the work done would be (5/24)*6 = 30/24 = 1.25. But that's more than the remaining 1/3. So this would mean the house is overpainted. \n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps after the 8 days, the third house needs 1/3 more. \n\nThe combined rate of Black and Blue is 1/8 +1/12 = 5/24 per day. \n\nTime needed to finish 1/3:\n\n(1/3) / (5/24) = (1/3)*(24/5) = 8/5 = 1.6 days. \n\nBut the problem says Mr. Black works for 6 days. So that would mean the work is finished in 1.6 days, but he works 6, so there's some over. But the problem says \"how many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\" \n\nThis is getting too complicated, and the options don't have fractions, so maybe this interpretation is wrong. \n\nTherefore, going back to the first approach where the total work is 3 houses, and each painter is working on any of them, not assigned. \n\nThe first interpretation where the work is done sequentially by each painter. \n\nSo, the total work is 3 houses. \n\nFirst 8 days: Mr. Brown paints alone. \n\nHe paints 8*(1/6) = 4/3 houses. \n\nThen next 6 days: Mr. Black paints alone. \n\n6*(1/8) = 3/4. \n\nTotal done: 4/3 + 3/4 = 25/12 \u22482.083. \n\nRemaining: 3 -25/12 =11/12. \n\nMr. Blue paints at 1/12 per day, so 11/12 divided by 1/12 is 11 days. \n\nWhich is option D. \n\nSo I think that's the correct answer.\n\n\nTo determine how many days Mr. Blue will take to complete the contract, we analyze the work done by each painter step by step:\n\n1. **Mr. Brown's Contribution (First 8 Days):**\n   - Rate: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) house/day.\n   - Work done in 8 days: \\( 8 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3} \\) houses.\n\n2. **Mr. Black's Contribution (Next 6 Days):**\n   - Rate: \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) house/day.\n   - Work done in 6 days: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} \\) houses.\n\n3. **Total Work Done After 14 Days:**\n   - Combined work: \\( \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{16}{12} + \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{25}{12} \\) houses.\n\n4. **Remaining Work:**\n   - Total required: 3 houses.\n   - Remaining: \\( 3 - \\frac{25}{12} = \\frac{36}{12} - \\frac{25}{12} = \\frac{11}{12} \\) houses.\n\n5. **Mr. Blue's Time to Complete Remaining Work:**\n   - Rate: \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) house/day.\n   - Days required: \\( \\frac{11/12}{1/12} = 11 \\) days.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **D) 11**.\n\nAnswer: D",
