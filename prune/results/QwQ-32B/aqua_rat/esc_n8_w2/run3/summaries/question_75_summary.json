      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a picket fence. Let me read it again. The question is asking for the length of the fence in feet. The fence has x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. And between each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches of space. Hmm, I need to figure out the total length.\n\nFirst, let me visualize this. The fence is straight, made up of pickets and spaces between them. Each picket is 0.5 inches wide. The spaces between each pair are 6 inches. Wait, so if there are x pickets, how many spaces are there between them?\n\nOh right, the number of spaces is one less than the number of pickets. Like, if you have two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, there are (x - 1) spaces. That makes sense.\n\nSo the total width contributed by the pickets would be the number of pickets multiplied by the width of each. That's x * 0.5 inches. Then the total width from the spaces is (x - 1) * 6 inches. Adding those two together gives the total length in inches. Then I need to convert that to feet because the answer is supposed to be in feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I'll have to divide by 12 at the end.\n\nLet me write that out step by step. \n\nTotal picket width = x * (1/2) inches.\n\nTotal space width = (x - 1) * 6 inches.\n\nTotal length in inches = (x/2) + 6(x - 1).\n\nThen convert inches to feet by dividing by 12. So total length in feet is [ (x/2 + 6x -6) ] / 12.\n\nWait, let me compute the numerator first. Let's combine the terms:\n\nx/2 + 6x -6. Hmm, to combine x terms, convert 6x to 12x/2 so that they have the same denominator. So:\n\nx/2 + (12x)/2 = (13x)/2. Then subtract 6. So numerator is (13x/2 -6).\n\nThen divide all that by 12 to get feet. So the total length is (13x/2 -6)/12.\n\nHmm, let me check my math again. Wait, let me recalculate the total length in inches first:\n\nTotal pickets: x*(1/2) = x/2 inches.\n\nSpaces: (x-1)*6 inches. So total is x/2 + 6(x-1). \n\nYes, expanding that gives x/2 +6x -6. \n\nWait, 6x is the same as 12x/2, so adding x/2 gives (13x)/2. Then subtract the 6. So total inches is (13x/2 -6). \n\nThen converting inches to feet, divide by 12. So (13x/2 -6)/12. Let's write that as a fraction over 12. To combine the terms, maybe get a common denominator in the numerator?\n\nAlternatively, let me see the options given. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions are A to E. Let me see:\n\nOption C is 13x/24. Hmm, but my current expression is (13x/2 -6)/12. Let's see:\n\nLet me factor numerator:\n\n(13x/2 -6) can be written as (13x -12)/2. Because 6 is 12/2. So 13x/2 -12/2 = (13x-12)/2. Then dividing by 12 gives (13x-12)/(2*12) = (13x-12)/24. Oh, that's option E? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nE is (13x -12)/24. Yes, that's exactly what I have here. So the answer must be E?\n\nWait, let me confirm again step by step.\n\nTotal length in inches:\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches, so x of them is 0.5x inches.\n\nBetween each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches. The number of gaps is (x-1). So total space is 6*(x-1).\n\nTotal inches: 0.5x +6(x-1) = 0.5x +6x -6 = 6.5x -6. \n\nWait, 6.5x is the same as 13x/2. So 13x/2 -6. \n\nYes, so converting to feet, divide by 12:\n\n(13x/2 -6)/12. \n\nTo combine the terms over a common denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator appropriately. Let's see:\n\nLet me write numerator as (13x -12)/2, because 6 is 12/2. So 13x/2 - 6 is 13x/2 - 12/2 = (13x -12)/2. Then dividing by 12, that's (13x-12)/(2*12) = (13x -12)/24. Which is exactly option E. \n\nHmm, so the answer is E. Let me check the other options again to be sure.\n\nOption C is 13x/24. That would be if there was no subtraction of 12. So maybe someone might forget the -6. So I think E is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of spaces? Let me check that again.\n\nNumber of spaces between x pickets is indeed x-1. For example, 2 pickets have 1 space. So yes, that's right.\n\nSo, the calculation is correct. The answer is E.\n",
