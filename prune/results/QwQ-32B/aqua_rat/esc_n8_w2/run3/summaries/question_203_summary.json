      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is about dividing Rs. 5100 between two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Their current ages are 23 and 24, respectively. The father wants to divide the money so that when their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, they'll have equal amounts when they reach 26. Hmm, right. I need to find Mohan's share. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much time each son has until they turn 26. Mohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he has 2 years until 26. So the investments will be compounded for different periods. \n\nThe key here is that the amounts they receive at age 26 should be equal. Let me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. Since the total is 5100, M + S = 5100. That's straightforward.\n\nNow, the amount each will have when they turn 26 is their principal multiplied by (1 + rate)^time. The rate is 4% per annum, so 0.04. \n\nFor Mohan, his amount after 3 years will be M*(1 + 0.04)^3. \n\nFor Sohan, since he only has 2 years until 26, his amount will be S*(1 + 0.04)^2. \n\nThese two amounts need to be equal. So:\n\nM*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2\n\nHmm, I can simplify that equation. Let's divide both sides by (1.04)^2. That leaves M*1.04 = S. \n\nSo S = 1.04*M. \n\nBut we also know that M + S = 5100. Substitute S here:\n\nM + 1.04*M = 5100 \u2192 2.04*M = 5100 \u2192 M = 5100 / 2.04. \n\nLet me compute that. 5100 divided by 2.04. Let me see: 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, right? Wait, 2.04 * 2500 would be 2500 * 2 = 5000 plus 2500 *0.04 = 100, so 5100. Oh! Wait, so 2.04 multiplied by 2500 gives exactly 5100. \n\nWait, so that means M is 2500? Because 2.04*M =5100 \u2192 M=2500. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check. \n\nIf M is 2500, then S would be 1.04 *2500 = 2600. Then 2500+2600 is 5100, which matches. \n\nBut let's check the final amounts. \n\nMohan's amount after 3 years: 2500*(1.04)^3. \n\nSohan's after 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2. \n\nLet me compute both. \n\nFirst, (1.04)^2 = 1.0816. \n\nSo Sohan's amount is 2600 *1.0816 = let's see: 2600*1.08 = 2808, plus 2600*0.0016=4.16? Wait, maybe better to calculate step by step.\n\nAlternatively, 2600 * 1.0816 = ?\n\n2600 *1 =2600, 2600 *0.08=208, 2600 *0.0016=4.16. So total 2600 +208=2808, plus 4.16 is 2812.16?\n\nWait maybe better to compute 1.04 squared is 1.0816. So 2600 *1.0816 = ?\n\nLet me calculate 2600 *1.0816:\n\nFirst, 2600 *1 =2600.\n\n2600 *0.08 =208 \u2192 2600 +208 =2808.\n\n2600 *0.0016: 2600 *0.001 is 2.6, so 0.0016 is 2.6 *1.6 =4.16. So adding that to 2808 gives 2812.16.\n\nNow Mohan's amount is 2500*(1.04)^3. Let's compute (1.04)^3. \n\n(1.04)^3 is 1.04*1.04*1.04. \n\nWe already know (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. Multiply by 1.04 again:\n\n1.0816 *1.04. Let's do this:\n\n1.0816 *1 =1.0816,\n\n1.0816 *0.04 =0.043264.\n\nAdding them gives 1.0816 +0.043264 =1.124864.\n\nSo (1.04)^3 =1.124864.\n\nSo Mohan's amount is 2500 *1.124864. \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n2500 *1.124864 = ?\n\n2500 *1 =2500,\n\n2500 *0.12 =300,\n\n2500 *0.004864 = ?\n\nWait, maybe better to break down 1.124864 as 1 +0.12 +0.004864.\n\nAlternatively, 2500 multiplied by 1.124864:\n\n2500 *1.124864 = 2500 * (1.12 + 0.004864)\n\n2500 *1.12 = 2800 (since 2500 *1.1 is 2750, plus 2500*0.02=50 \u2192 2800).\n\n2500 *0.004864 = 2500 *0.004 =10, plus 2500*0.000864=2.16 \u2192 total 12.16.\n\nSo adding 2800 +12.16 gives 2812.16. \n\nSo both amounts are 2812.16. So that works. \n\nTherefore, Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B. \n\nWait, but the options given are A)2400, B)2500, etc. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem says Mohan and Sohan's current ages are 23 and 24. So Mohan is younger. So he has 3 years until 26, Sohan has 2. \n\nThe setup was correct. The equations also seem correct. So the answer is B. But let me check the calculation once again. \n\nThe equation S =1.04*M. Then M + S =5100 \u2192 M +1.04M = 2.04 M =5100 \u2192 M =5100 /2.04. \n\nCalculating 5100 divided by 2.04. Let's do this division. \n\nLet me write 5100 divided by 2.04. \n\nFirst, 2.04 \u00d7 2500 = 2.04 \u00d725 \u00d7100 =51 \u00d7100 =5100. Exactly. \n\nSo yes, M is 2500. So the answer is B. \n\nHmm, but wait the options have B as 2500, so that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n",

Mohan is 23 and Sohan is 24 now. Hmm, I need to figure out Mohan's share.\n\nLet me think. The key here is that the money they get now will grow with compound interest until they are both 26. Since Mohan is 23 now, he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. The father wants their shares to grow to the same amount at those times. \n\nSo, let me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's share as S. We know that M + S = 5100. The other equation comes from the compound interest part. \n\nThe formula for compound amount is A = P(1 + r)^t, where r is the rate and t the time in years. Since it's 4% per annum, r is 0.04. \n\nFor Mohan, his amount after 3 years should equal Sohan's amount after 2 years. So:\n\nM*(1 + 0.04)^3 = S*(1 + 0.04)^2\n\nHmm, simplifying that equation. Let's see, divide both sides by (1.04)^2, so we get M*(1.04) = S. \n\nTherefore, S = M * 1.04.\n\nNow, substitute S into the first equation:\n\nM + 1.04M = 5100 \u2192 2.04M = 5100 \u2192 M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. Let's see, 5100 divided by 2.04. Maybe I can simplify this. Let me see:\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 1.02? Not sure. Alternatively, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100? Let me check 2.04*2500: 2*2500=5000 and 0.04*2500=100, so total 5100. Oh! Wait, so 2.04 multiplied by 2500 is exactly 5100. That means M is 2500? Wait, but according to the equation above, M is 5100 divided by 2.04. So 5100 /2.04 = 2500. Because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. So that would make M=2500 and S=2500*1.04 = 2600. \n\nWait, but the options have 2500 as B and 2600 as C. So the question asks for Mohan's share. If Mohan is the one who gets 2500, then the answer would be B. But let me double-check everything.\n\nWait, the problem says \"they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years.\" So Mohan's money is invested for 3 years, Sohan's for 2. The equations are correct: M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 M*(1.04) = S. \n\nSo S = 1.04*M. Then total M + S = M + 1.04M = 2.04M = 5100 \u2192 M = 5100 / 2.04 = 2500. So yes, that seems right. \n\nBut let me check the options. Option B is 2500, which would be Mohan's share. So the answer should be B? But wait, let me see the options again. The options are A)2400, B)2500, etc. So B is an option. \n\nHmm, but wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in who gets which. Wait, Mohan is younger, so he has to wait longer for his money to grow. Since the interest is compounded, the one with more time would have their principal grow more. Since they need to end up equal, the one with less time (Sohan, 2 years) must have a larger initial amount? Wait, because his money is invested for a shorter period, so to reach the same final amount, he must start with more. \n\nYes, exactly. Because if you have a shorter time, you need a bigger principal to reach the same amount. So Mohan's share is smaller. Which aligns with what I found: Mohan gets 2500, Sohan 2600. So that makes sense. \n\nSo the answer should be B)2500. But let me check the calculation again. 2500*(1.04)^3 versus 2600*(1.04)^2. \n\nCalculating Mohan's amount: 2500*(1.04)^3. Let's compute step by step. \n\nFirst, 1.04^3 is 1.04 * 1.04 *1.04. 1.04 squared is 1.0816. Multiply by 1.04 again: 1.0816 *1.04. Let's see, 1.0816 *1 = 1.0816, plus 1.0816 *0.04 = 0.043264. Total is 1.124864. \n\nSo 2500 * 1.124864 = 2500 *1.124864. Let me calculate that. 2500*1 =2500, 2500*0.124864 = 2500 *0.12 =300, plus 2500*0.004864 = 12.16. So total is 300 +12.16 = 312.16. So total amount 2500 +312.16=2812.16.\n\nFor Sohan's share: 2600*(1.04)^2. 1.04 squared is 1.0816. 2600 *1.0816. Let's see, 2600 *1 =2600, 2600 *0.08=208, 2600*0.0016=4.16. So total 208 +4.16=212.16. So total amount 2600 +212.16 = 2812.16. \n\nYes, they are equal. So the calculations are correct. So Mohan's share is 2500. The answer should be B. \n\nLooking at the options again, B is 2500. So that's the answer. I don't see any mistake here. The key was setting up the equations correctly based on the time periods each investment has to grow. \n",

Let's see, divide both sides by (1.04)^2, so we get M*(1.04) = S. \n\nTherefore, S = M * 1.04.\n\nNow, substitute S into the first equation:\n\nM + 1.04M = 5100 \u2192 2.04M = 5100 \u2192 M = 5100 / 2.04.\n\nLet me calculate that. Let's see, 5100 divided by 2.04. Maybe I can simplify this. Let me see:\n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 1.02? Not sure. Alternatively, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100? Let me check 2.04*2500: 2*2500=5000 and 0.04*2500=100, so total 5100. Oh! Wait, so 2.04 multiplied by 2500 is exactly 5100. That means M is 2500? Wait, but according to the equation above, M is 5100 divided by 2.04. So 5100 /2.04 = 2500. Because 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. So that would make M=2500 and S=2500*1.04 = 2600. \n\nWait, but the options have 2500 as B and 2600 as C. So the question asks for Mohan's share. If Mohan is the one who gets 2500, then the answer would be B. But let me double-check everything.\n\nWait, the problem says \"they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years.\" So Mohan's money is invested for 3 years, Sohan's for 2. The equations are correct: M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2 \u2192 M*(1.04) = S. \n\nSo S = 1.04*M. Then total M + S = M + 1.04M = 2.04M = 5100 \u2192 M = 5100 / 2.04 = 2500. So yes, that seems right. \n\nBut let me check the options. Option B is 2500, which would be Mohan's share. So the answer should be B? But wait, let me see the options again. The options are A)2400, B)2500, etc. So B is an option. \n\nHmm, but wait a second, maybe I made a mistake in who gets which. Wait, Mohan is younger, so he has to wait longer for his money to grow. Since the interest is compounded, the one with more time would have their principal grow more. Since they need to end up equal, the one with less time (Sohan, 2 years) must have a larger initial amount? Wait, because his money is invested for a shorter period, so to reach the same final amount, he must start with more. \n\nYes, exactly. Because if you have a shorter time, you need a bigger principal to reach the same amount. So Mohan's share is smaller. Which aligns with what I found: Mohan gets 2500, Sohan 2600. So that makes sense. \n\nSo the answer should be B)2500. But let me check the calculation again. 2500*(1.04)^3 versus 2600*(1.04)^2. \n\nCalculating Mohan's amount: 2500*(1.04)^3. Let's compute step by step. \n\nFirst, 1.04^3 is 1.04 * 1.04 *1.04. 1.04 squared is 1.0816. Multiply by 1.04 again: 1.0816 *1.04. Let's see, 1.0816 *1 = 1.0816, plus 1.0816 *0.04 = 0.043264. Total is 1.124864. \n\nSo 2500 * 1.124864 = 2500 *1.124864. Let me calculate that. 2500*1 =2500, 2500*0.124864 = 2500 *0.12 =300, plus 2500*0.004864 = 12.16. So total is 300 +12.16 = 312.16. So total amount 2500 +312.16=2812.16.\n\nFor Sohan's share: 2600*(1.04)^2. 1.04 squared is 1.0816. 2600 *1.0816. Let's see, 2600 *1 =2600, 2600 *0.08=208, 2600*0.0016=4.16. So total 208 +4.16=212.16. So total amount 2600 +212.16 = 2812.16. \n\nYes, they are equal. So the calculations are correct. So Mohan's share is 2500. The answer should be B. \n\nLooking at the options again, B is 2500. So that's the answer. I don't see any mistake here. The key was setting up the equations correctly based on the time periods each investment has to grow. \n\n\nTo determine Mohan's share, we note that his amount will grow for 3 years (until age 26) while Sohan's will grow for 2 years. Let Mohan's share be \\( M \\) and Sohan's be \\( S \\). The equations are:\n\n\\[\nM + S = 5100\n\\]\n\\[\nM(1 + 0.04)^3 = S(1 + 0.04)^2\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the second equation by dividing both sides by \\((1.04)^2\\):\n\n\\[\nM(1.04) = S\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( S = 1.04M \\) into the first equation:\n\n\\[\nM + 1.04M = 5100 \\implies 2.04M = 5100 \\implies M = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\nVerification shows that both shares grow to the same amount at age 26, confirming the solution. Mohan's share is **2500**.\n\nAnswer: B",
