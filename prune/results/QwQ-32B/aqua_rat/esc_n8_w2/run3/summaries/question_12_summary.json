      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem about the factory producing staplers. Hmm, the question is asking for the total number of staplers produced on Monday. Alright, let's break down the information step by step. \n\nFirst, it says that 10% of the staplers produced were defective. So if I let the total number of staplers be, say, X, then 10% of X are defective, which means 90% are non-defective. Right? Because 100% minus 10% is 90%. \n\nThen, it mentions that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. And we're told that the number of non-defective staplers rejected is 72. So I need to connect these percentages to the actual number given. \n\nLet me write this out. Let's denote the total staplers produced as X. \n\nDefective staplers: 10% of X \u2192 0.10X. \nNon-defective staplers: 90% of X \u2192 0.90X. \n\nNow, 2% of these non-defective were rejected. So the rejected non-defective would be 2% of 0.90X. \n\nThe problem states that this amount equals 72. So, mathematically, that would be:\n\n0.02 * (0.90X) = 72\n\nLet me compute that. \n\nFirst, multiply 0.02 and 0.90. 0.02 * 0.9 is 0.018. So 0.018X =72. \n\nTo find X, I can divide both sides by 0.018. \n\nX = 72 / 0.018\n\nHmm, calculating that. Let's see. 72 divided by 0.018. Maybe I can do this step by step. \n\nAlternatively, 0.018 is the same as 18/1000. So dividing by 18/1000 is the same as multiplying by 1000/18. \n\nSo 72 * (1000/18) = ?\n\nLet me compute that. Let's see:\n\n72 divided by 18 is 4, right? Because 18*4=72. \n\nSo 4 *1000 = 4000. Wait, that would make X 4000. \n\nBut let me check again. \n\nWait, 0.018 * 4000 = 72?\n\nYes. 4000 * 0.01 is 40, so 0.018 is 40 * 1.8, which is 72. \n\nYes, that works. So X would be 4000. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4,000. \n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. \n\nStarting over:\n\nTotal staplers = X.\n\nDefective: 10% \u2192 0.1X. So non-defective is 0.9X. \n\nOf those non-defective, 2% were rejected. So 0.02 * 0.9X = rejected non-defectives. \n\nThat equals 72. \n\nSo equation: 0.02 *0.9 X =72 \u2192 0.018X =72 \u2192 X =72/0.018 = 4000. \n\nHmm, that seems right. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)4,000, B)4,200, etc. So the answer should be A. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read again. \n\n\"10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?\"\n\nYes, that's exactly what I did. The non-defective is 90% of total, 2% of that is 72, so the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but I recall sometimes when percentages are involved, maybe there's a trick. Like, maybe the rejection is 2% of the total non-defective, which is exactly how I took it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check the arithmetic again. Let's calculate 72 divided by 0.018. \n\n0.018 times 4000: \n\n4000 * 0.01 is 40. 4000 *0.008 is 32. 40+32=72. Exactly. \n\nYes, so that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A)4,000.\n",

The problem states that 10% of the staplers were defective. Then, 2% of the non-defective ones were rejected by mistake. And we know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. We need to find the total number produced that day.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. Let's denote the total number of staplers produced as, say, N. Then, 10% of those are defective. So defective staplers would be 0.10 * N. That means the non-defective ones are the remaining 90%, right? So non-defective = N - 0.10N = 0.90N.\n\nNow, of these non-defectives, 2% were rejected by mistake. The problem says that this number equals 72. So, 2% of the non-defective staplers is 72. Let me write that as an equation. \n\nSo 2% of 0.90N = 72. In math terms, that's 0.02 * 0.90 * N = 72. Let me compute 0.02 * 0.90 first. 0.02 times 0.9 is 0.018. So 0.018 * N = 72. \n\nTo find N, I need to divide 72 by 0.018. Let me do that calculation. Hmm, 72 divided by 0.018. Let me think. Maybe I can rewrite this as 72 / (18/1000) which is 72 * (1000/18). Let's see, 72 divided by 18 is 4, so 4 * 1000 is 4000. Wait, so that would give N as 4000? Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, 0.018 times N is 72. Let me compute 72 divided by 0.018. Let me write this out numerically. 72 divided by 0.018. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals: 72000 / 18. 72 divided by 18 is 4, so 72000 divided by 18 is 4000. Yes, so N is 4000. That would be option A. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let's go through the steps again. \n\nTotal staplers: N. 10% defective, so non-defective is 90% of N. Then 2% of those non-defectives were rejected. So 2% of 90%N = 72. \n\nSo 0.02 * 0.9N =72 \u2192 0.018N=72 \u2192 N=72/0.018 = 4000. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. Let me check with another approach. Suppose the total is 4000. Then defective is 10% of 4000 = 400. Non-defective is 3600. Then 2% of 3600 is 72. Exactly what the problem states. So that checks out. \n\nSo the answer should be A) 4,000.
