      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out this multiplication table problem. The setup is:\n\nM A D\nB E\n-------------\nM A D\nR A E\n-------------\nA M I D\n\nAnd the options are different numbers for A, M, I, D. Hmm, so the question is to find which of the options A to E correctly represents the values of A, M, I, D respectively.\n\nFirst, I remember that in multiplication tables like this, each letter represents a unique digit. So each letter (M, A, D, B, E, R, I) stands for a different digit from 0-9. Also, the multiplication is such that when you multiply the three-digit number MAD by the two-digit number BE, you get the four-digit number AMID. The intermediate steps are MAD (the first partial product) and RA E (the second partial product, probably shifted one place to the left because of the E in BE), and then adding those gives AMID.\n\nWait, the way the multiplication is presented here might be:\n\n   M A D\n\u00d7    B E\n----------\n   M A D   (this is MAD \u00d7 E)\n+ R A E    (this is MAD \u00d7 B, but shifted one position to the left, so actually MAD \u00d7 B \u00d7 10)\n----------\n= A M I D\n\nSo when adding the two partial products, the total is A M I D. \n\nLet me try to write this as equations. Let's denote the numbers numerically:\n\nLet MAD be 100*M + 10*A + D.\n\nSimilarly, BE is 10*B + E.\n\nThe product would be (100*M +10*A + D) \u00d7 (10*B + E) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nThe partial products are:\n\nFirst partial product: MAD \u00d7 E = (100*M +10*A + D) \u00d7 E = M A D (the same as the original number? Wait, but that can't be unless E is 1. Wait, the first partial product is written as MAD, but that would mean that when you multiply MAD by E, you get MAD again. So that suggests that E must be 1. Because MAD \u00d7 E = MAD \u21d2 E=1. But wait, maybe not exactly. Wait, maybe the first partial product is written as a three-digit number M A D. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the first partial product (from E) is written as MAD, but perhaps with leading zeros if needed, but since it's written as three digits, perhaps E must be 1. Because if E is 1, then multiplying MAD by 1 would give MAD. So that's possible. So E is 1. Then the second partial product (from B) would be MAD \u00d7 B, but shifted one position to the left (since B is the tens digit). So when you write that down, it's R A E. Wait, but the shifted partial product would be a four-digit number? Because multiplying a three-digit number by a digit (B) and then shifting left by one (multiplying by 10) would make it four digits. But here the second partial product is written as R A E, which is three digits. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me try to structure the multiplication properly. Let me denote the multiplication as:\n\n       M A D\n     \u00d7   B E\n     ---------\n        M A D   (this is MAD \u00d7 E)\n      + R A E   (this is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one)\n     ---------\n      A M I D\n\nSo the second partial product (MAD \u00d7 B) must be a three-digit number when shifted left by one, meaning that before shifting, it's a three-digit number (since shifting left by one makes it four digits). Wait, no. Wait, if you multiply a three-digit number by B (a single digit), the result could be up to three digits (if B is 9 and MAD is 999, then 999\u00d79=8991 which is four digits, so that can't be. Wait, so maybe B is a digit such that when multiplied by MAD, it's a three-digit number. So that would require that B \u00d7 MAD is less than 1000. Hmm, but if MAD is a three-digit number (like 100 or more), then B would have to be small, like 1 or 2. But perhaps the second partial product before shifting is three digits, so that when shifted left, it becomes four digits. Wait, but the way it's written here, the second partial product is written as R A E, which is three digits. So that suggests that when you shift it left by one, it becomes a four-digit number? No, because the second line is written as R A E, which is three digits, but when added to the first partial product (which is three digits), the total is four digits. Wait, perhaps the second partial product (MAD \u00d7 B) is a three-digit number, and when shifted left (multiplied by 10), it becomes a four-digit number. But in the problem's written layout, the second partial product is written as R A E (three digits). That would only make sense if the shifted partial product is written with a leading zero. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to think numerically.\n\nSuppose MAD \u00d7 E = MAD. Then E must be 1. So that would make sense. So E is 1. Then the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, and when shifted left (multiplied by 10), it's written as R A E (but shifted). Wait, perhaps when written, the second partial product (MAD \u00d7 B) is a three-digit number, and when shifted left (adding a zero), it would be four digits. But the problem shows that the second partial product is written as R A E, so perhaps that's the actual value before shifting? That would be conflicting. Maybe the notation here is that the first partial product is MAD (from E=1), and the second partial product is (MAD \u00d7 B) shifted left by one, so written as R A E0 (but written without the zero?), but the problem shows R A E. Hmm, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second partial product (MAD \u00d7 B) is a three-digit number, which when shifted left by one (i.e., multiplied by 10) becomes a four-digit number. So the written line R A E would actually be the three-digit number before shifting. Wait, but then when you shift it left, it becomes four digits. So when you add the first partial product (three digits) and the shifted second (four digits), you get a four-digit number. But the total is A M I D (four digits). Let me see:\n\nFirst partial product: MAD \u00d7 E = MAD (so E=1)\nSecond partial product: (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d710. Let's call that (MAD \u00d7 B)*10.\n\nThe sum is MAD + (MAD \u00d7 B)*10 = A M I D (the four-digit number). \n\nSo the total is (10*B + 1) \u00d7 MAD = A M I D. \n\nWait, but the multiplication is (BE) \u00d7 (MAD) = (10B + E)*MAD. Since E is 1, that's (10B +1)*MAD = A M I D. \n\nHmm, but how do the partial products work? The first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD, which is correct. The second is MAD \u00d7 B, but shifted left (multiplied by 10). So the second partial product line (the R A E) is actually the value of MAD \u00d7 B, written as R A E. Then when shifted, it becomes R A E0 (with a zero at the end?), but in the problem's written form, the second partial product is written as R A E, but shifted left, so adding a zero? Wait, maybe in the problem's layout, the second partial product is written as R A E, but shifted left so that the units digit is in the tens place. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second partial product (MAD \u00d7 B) is written as R A E, which is three digits. Then when shifted left (multiplied by 10), it becomes a four-digit number, R A E 0 (but written as R A E shifted). But when adding to the first partial product (MAD), which is three digits, the total is four digits. \n\nLet me try to write equations for each digit. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me denote the numbers:\n\nLet\u2019s let MAD be 100*M + 10*A + D.\n\nBE is 10*B + E.\n\nThe product is (100*M +10*A + D)*(10*B + E) = A M I D (which is 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D).\n\nThe partial products are:\n\nFirst: MAD \u00d7 E = (100*M +10*A + D)*E = M A D (the same digits as MAD). So this suggests that (MAD)*E = MAD. So that implies E must be 1, since multiplying by 1 gives the same number. So E =1.\n\nSo E is 1. So the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, which when shifted left (multiplied by 10) is (MAD \u00d7 B)*10. \n\nSo the total is MAD*(E) + (MAD \u00d7 B)*10 = MAD*(10B + E) = MAD*(10B+1) = A M I D.\n\nSo the total is (100*M +10*A + D)*(10B +1) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nHmm. Let's also note that the second partial product (before shifting) is MAD \u00d7 B, which is a three-digit number R A E. Wait, since E is 1, the last digit of MAD \u00d7 B would be the units digit of (D \u00d7 B). But the second partial product's units digit is E (which is 1). So D \u00d7 B must end with 1. \n\nSo D*B mod 10 =1. \n\nAlso, the second partial product is R A E (three digits). So (MAD \u00d7 B) = R A E. \n\nAdditionally, the first partial product is MAD \u00d71 = MAD, so that's straightforward. \n\nSo let's try to set up equations:\n\nFirst, E=1. \n\nThe second partial product (MAD \u00d7 B) must have its units digit equal to E (1). So D \u00d7 B must end with 1. \n\nAlso, when you add the two partial products (MAD and (MAD \u00d7 B)*10), the sum is A M I D.\n\nLet me think of possible digits. Let's see the options given. The options are for A, M, I, D. The options are:\n\nA) 9 2 0 0 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=0. But D is 0, but then D \u00d7 B would have to end with 1, which can't be if D is 0. So A is invalid.\n\nB) 9 2 0 9 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=9. Let's see D is 9. Then D*B mod10=1 \u21d2 9*B mod10=1. So 9*B ends with 1. Let's see, 9\u00d79=81 \u2192 1 mod10. So B=9. But then B is 9. Let's see. Let's check if this could work.\n\nC) 9 2 0 1 \u2192 D=1. Then D\u00d7B mod10=1 \u2192 1\u00d7B mod10=1 \u21d2 B can be 1, but E is already 1. So B can't be same as E. So B must be 11? No. So B=1 would conflict with E=1, so invalid.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 D=7. Then 7\u00d7B mod10=1. So 7*B mod10=1. Let's see 7\u00d73=21 \u2192 1 mod10. So B=3.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 D=2. Then 2\u00d7B mod10=1 \u2192 2*B ends with 1. But 2*B is even, so can't end with 1. So invalid. So E is out.\n\nSo possible candidates are B and D. Let's check B first.\n\nOption B: A=9, M=2, I=0, D=9.\n\nSo let's see. The four-digit product is A M I D \u2192 9 2 0 9 \u2192 9209.\n\nThe multiplier is BE, where E=1, so B is the remaining digit. Since D is 9, and D\u00d7B mod10 must be 1, so B must be 9 (since 9\u00d79=81). So B is 9. \n\nThen BE is 99? Wait, but B is 9, E=1 \u2192 BE is 91. Wait, BE is 10*B + E \u2192 B is the tens digit, so if B is 9, then BE is 91. \n\nWait, so let's compute the product MAD \u00d7 BE. \n\nMAD would be the three-digit number with M=2, A=9, D=9 \u2192 2 9 9 \u2192 299.\n\nBE is 91 (since B=9 and E=1).\n\nSo 299 \u00d7 91 = ?\n\nCalculating that: 299 \u00d7 90 = 26,910, plus 299 \u00d71 =299 \u2192 total 26,910 +299=27,209. \n\nBut the product should be A M I D which is 9209. That's way off. So that can't be correct. So option B is invalid. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, the product is supposed to be 9209? Let me check again. \n\nWait the four-digit product is A M I D, which with option B's digits would be A=9, M=2, I=0, D=9 \u2192 9209. But the actual product is 299 \u00d791 = 27,209, which is a five-digit number. So that's way larger. So that's impossible, so B is invalid. \n\nHmm, so maybe B is not the correct one. Let's check option D: \n\nOption D: A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo D is 7. Then D \u00d7 B mod10 =1 \u2192 7\u00d7B mod10=1. So 7\u00d73=21 \u2192 B=3. \n\nSo B=3. Then BE is 10*B +1 \u2192 3\u00d710 +1=31. \n\nMAD is the three-digit number M=2, A=9, D=7 \u2192 297. \n\nSo 297 \u00d731 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 297 \u00d730=8,910; 297 \u00d71=297 \u2192 total 8,910 +297=9,207. \n\nThe product is 9207, which would be written as A M I D. Let's see: A is the first digit, which is 9 (matches option D's A=9). M is the second digit, 2 (matches M=2). I is the third digit, 0 (matches I=0). D is 7 (matches D=7). So the four-digit number is 9207, which would be written as A M I D (9 2 0 7). So that matches option D. \n\nWait, but the options are given as:\n\nOption D is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 which would correspond to A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. Exactly. \n\nNow, let's check if the partial products fit. \n\nFirst partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = 297 \u00d71 =297 \u2192 which is M A D (297). So that matches.\n\nSecond partial product is MAD \u00d7 B = 297 \u00d73 = 891. Then, since it's shifted left by one (because B is the tens digit in BE), that becomes 8910. \n\nAdding the two partial products: 297 +8910 =9207. Which matches the total. \n\nNow, in the problem's layout, the second partial product is written as R A E. So the unshifted second partial product (before shifting) is 297 \u00d73 = 891. The digits of that are 8, 9, 1. So R is 8, A is 9 (matches the given A=9), and E is 1 (which matches E=1). So that works. So R is 8, which is a new digit not mentioned in the options. \n\nSo all the letters:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8, I=0. \n\nThese are all distinct digits, which is okay. \n\nSo the options given for D are the digits A, M, I, D in order. So the answer would be D:9 2 0 7, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me check other options again. Let's see option C: 9 2 0 1. \n\nA=9, M=2, I=0, D=1. \n\nThen D=1, so D\u00d7B mod10 must be 1. Since D is 1, B can be 1 (but E is already 1, so conflict), or B= 11? Not possible. So B would have to be 1, but E is 1. So invalid. So C is out. \n\nSo the only possible correct answer is D. \n\nWait, let me check if there's another possibility. Let me see option B again. Wait, in option B, D is 9, so D\u00d7B mod10=1. So B must be 9 (since 9\u00d79=81). Then B=9, E=1. \n\nThen BE is 91, and MAD is 2 9 9 (since M=2, A=9, D=9). \n\n299 \u00d791 = 27,209. The four-digit product would have to be 9209, but 27,209 is a five-digit number, so that's impossible. So B is invalid. \n\nSo the only possible answer is D. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a multiplication table where the three-digit number MAD multiplied by the two-digit number BE equals the four-digit number AMID.

Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me denote the numbers:\n\nLet\u2019s let MAD be 100*M + 10*A + D.\n\nBE is 10*B + E.\n\nThe product is (100*M +10*A + D)*(10*B + E) = A M I D (which is 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D).\n\nThe partial products are:\n\nFirst: MAD \u00d7 E = (100*M +10*A + D)*E = M A D (the same digits as MAD). So this suggests that (MAD)*E = MAD. So that implies E must be 1, since multiplying by 1 gives the same number. So E =1.\n\nSo E is 1. So the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, which when shifted left (multiplied by 10) is (MAD \u00d7 B)*10. \n\nSo the total is MAD*(E) + (MAD \u00d7 B)*10 = MAD*(10B + E) = MAD*(10B+1) = A M I D.\n\nSo the total is (100*M +10*A + D)*(10B +1) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nHmm. Let's also note that the second partial product (before shifting) is MAD \u00d7 B, which is a three-digit number R A E. Wait, since E is 1, the last digit of MAD \u00d7 B would be the units digit of (D \u00d7 B). But the second partial product's units digit is E (which is 1). So D \u00d7 B must end with 1. \n\nSo D*B mod 10 =1. \n\nAlso, the second partial product is R A E (three digits). So (MAD \u00d7 B) = R A E. \n\nAdditionally, the first partial product is MAD \u00d71 = MAD, so that's straightforward. \n\nSo let's try to set up equations:\n\nFirst, E=1. \n\nThe second partial product (MAD \u00d7 B) must have its units digit equal to E (1). So D \u00d7 B must end with 1. \n\nAlso, when you add the two partial products (MAD and (MAD \u00d7 B)*10), the sum is A M I D.\n\nLet me think of possible digits. Let's see the options given. The options are for A, M, I, D. The options are:\n\nA) 9 2 0 0 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=0. But D is 0, but then D \u00d7 B would have to end with 1, which can't be if D is 0. So A is invalid.\n\nB) 9 2 0 9 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=9. Let's see D is 9. Then D*B mod10=1 \u21d2 9*B mod10=1. So 9*B ends with 1. Let's see, 9\u00d79=81 \u2192 1 mod10. So B=9. But then B is 9. Let's see. Let's check if this could work.\n\nC) 9 2 0 1 \u2192 D=1. Then D\u00d7B mod10=1 \u2192 1\u00d7B mod10=1 \u21d2 B can be 1, but E is already 1. So B can't be same as E. So B must be 11? No. So B=1 would conflict with E=1, so invalid.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 D=7. Then 7\u00d7B mod10=1. So 7*B mod10=1. Let's see 7\u00d73=21 \u2192 1 mod10. So B=3.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 D=2. Then 2\u00d7B mod10=1 \u2192 2*B ends with 1. But 2*B is even, so can't end with 1. So invalid. So E is out.\n\nSo possible candidates are B and D. Let's check B first.\n\nOption B: A=9, M=2, I=0, D=9.\n\nSo let's see. The four-digit product is A M I D \u2192 9 2 0 9 \u2192 9209.\n\nThe multiplier is BE, where E=1, so B is the remaining digit. Since D is 9, and D\u00d7B mod10 must be 1, so B must be 9 (since 9\u00d79=81). So B is 9. \n\nThen BE is 99? Wait, but B is 9, E=1 \u2192 BE is 91. Wait, BE is 10*B + E \u2192 B is the tens digit, so if B is 9, then BE is 91. \n\nWait, so let's compute the product MAD \u00d7 BE. \n\nMAD would be the three-digit number with M=2, A=9, D=9 \u2192 2 9 9 \u2192 299.\n\nBE is 91 (since B=9 and E=1).\n\nSo 299 \u00d7 91 = ?\n\nCalculating that: 299 \u00d7 90 = 26,910, plus 299 \u00d71 =299 \u2192 total 26,910 +299=27,209. \n\nBut the product should be A M I D which is 9209. That's way off. So that can't be correct. So option B is invalid. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, the product is supposed to be 9209? Let me check again. \n\nWait the four-digit product is A M I D, which with option B's digits would be A=9, M=2, I=0, D=9 \u2192 9209. But the actual product is 299 \u00d791 = 27,209, which is a five-digit number. So that's way larger. So that's impossible, so B is invalid. \n\nHmm, so maybe B is not the correct one. Let's check option D: \n\nOption D: A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7.\n\nSo D is 7. Then D \u00d7 B mod10 =1 \u2192 7\u00d7B mod10=1. So 7\u00d73=21 \u2192 B=3. \n\nSo B=3. Then BE is 10*B +1 \u2192 3\u00d710 +1=31. \n\nMAD is the three-digit number M=2, A=9, D=7 \u2192 297. \n\nSo 297 \u00d731 = ?\n\nLet me compute that. 297 \u00d730=8,910; 297 \u00d71=297 \u2192 total 8,910 +297=9,207. \n\nThe product is 9207, which would be written as A M I D. Let's see: A is the first digit, which is 9 (matches option D's A=9). M is the second digit, 2 (matches M=2). I is the third digit, 0 (matches I=0). D is 7 (matches D=7). So the four-digit number is 9207, which would be written as A M I D (9 2 0 7). So that matches option D. \n\nWait, but the options are given as:\n\nOption D is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 which would correspond to A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. Exactly. \n\nNow, let's check if the partial products fit. \n\nFirst partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = 297 \u00d71 =297 \u2192 which is M A D (297). So that matches.\n\nSecond partial product is MAD \u00d7 B = 297 \u00d73 = 891. Then, since it's shifted left by one (because B is the tens digit in BE), that becomes 8910. \n\nAdding the two partial products: 297 +8910 =9207. Which matches the total. \n\nNow, in the problem's layout, the second partial product is written as R A E. So the unshifted second partial product (before shifting) is 297 \u00d73 = 891. The digits of that are 8, 9, 1. So R is 8, A is 9 (matches the given A=9), and E is 1 (which matches E=1). So that works. So R is 8, which is a new digit not mentioned in the options. \n\nSo all the letters:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8, I=0. \n\nThese are all distinct digits, which is okay. \n\nSo the options given for D are the digits A, M, I, D in order. So the answer would be D:9 2 0 7, which matches.\n\nWait, but let me check other options again. Let's see option C: 9 2 0 1. \n\nA=9, M=2, I=0, D=1. \n\nThen D=1, so D\u00d7B mod10 must be 1. Since D is 1, B can be 1 (but E is already 1, so conflict), or B= 11? Not possible. So B would have to be 1, but E is 1. So invalid. So C is out. \n\nSo the only possible correct answer is D. \n\nWait, let me check if there's another possibility. Let me see option B again. Wait, in option B, D is 9, so D\u00d7B mod10=1. So B must be 9 (since 9\u00d79=81). Then B=9, E=1. \n\nThen BE is 91, and MAD is 2 9 9 (since M=2, A=9, D=9). \n\n299 \u00d791 = 27,209. The four-digit product would have to be 9209, but 27,209 is a five-digit number, so that's impossible. So B is invalid. \n\nSo the only possible answer is D. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is D.\n\n\nThe problem involves a multiplication table where the three-digit number MAD multiplied by the two-digit number BE equals the four-digit number AMID. The key steps are:\n\n1. **Identify E**: The first partial product (MAD \u00d7 E) equals MAD, implying E = 1.\n2. **Determine D and B**: The second partial product (MAD \u00d7 B) must end in E (1). Thus, D \u00d7 B \u2261 1 mod 10. Testing the options:\n   - **Option D** (A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7): D=7, so B must be 3 (since 7\u00d73=21). \n   - **Check validity**: MAD = 297, BE = 31. The product 297\u00d731 = 9207, which matches AMID (9207). The partial products are 297 (MAD) and 891 (MAD \u00d7 3, written as RAE before shifting), which align with the given structure. All digits are distinct and fit the options.\n\nOther options (A, B, C, E) fail due to contradictions (e.g., invalid digit constraints or incorrect product lengths).\n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this multiplication table problem. The question gives a multiplication setup with some letters and a result. The options are numbers for M, A, D, B, E, R, I. Wait, the options are four numbers each, so maybe each represents M, A, D, B, E, R, I? Wait, the options have four numbers each. The problem's options are labeled A to E, each with four digits. Hmm, the question says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options probably correspond to the values of M, A, D, B, E, R, I, but maybe each option lists four digits, perhaps the key letters? Let me check the question again.\n\nThe problem's setup is:\n\n   M A D\nx    B E\n-------------\n   M A D    (this is the first partial product, from E multiplied)\n+ R A E     (this is the second partial product, from B multiplied, shifted left by one)\n-------------\n= A M I D    (the final product)\n\nSo the multiplication is (MAD) * (BE) = AMID. The partial products are MAD (from E * MAD) and RAE (from B * MAD, shifted left by one place). Adding those two gives AMID.\n\nHmm. So we need to find digits for each letter such that when you multiply the three-digit number MAD by the two-digit BE, you get the four-digit number AMID, and the partial products are as shown.\n\nFirst, let's note that the letters involved are M, A, D, B, E, R, I. Each letter represents a unique digit, probably from 0-9, but with some constraints. For example, the first digit of a number can't be zero. So M, B, A can't be zero. Also, the final product AMID starts with A, so A is the first digit, so A can't be zero either.\n\nLooking at the first partial product: when you multiply MAD by E, you get MAD again. Wait, that's interesting. So E must be 1, because multiplying by 1 leaves the number the same. But wait, unless there's a carryover? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the first partial product is MAD. That comes from E multiplied by MAD. So E * MAD = MAD. That suggests that E must be 1, right? Because 1 times any number is the number itself. But could there be a carryover? Let me think. Suppose E is 1, then yes. But if E is higher, but with some carries, maybe? Let's see. For example, if E is 6 and MAD is 105, then 105*6 = 630, which is different. So that can't be. So the only way that E * MAD equals MAD is if E is 1, and there are no carryover digits. Otherwise, the product would be different. So maybe E is 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a carryover that cancels out? Hmm, that's possible, but it's tricky. Let's tentatively assume E is 1.\n\nSo E = 1.\n\nThen, the second partial product is RAE, which comes from multiplying MAD by B, shifted left by one (so multiplied by 10). So B * MAD = RAE * 10? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply by the tens digit (B), you shift left one, so the result of B*MAD would be RAE (but written shifted left, so when added to the first partial product, which is MAD, the total would be AMID.\n\nWait, the second partial product is written as R A E, but since it's multiplied by the B (the tens place of BE), it's actually B*MAD shifted left by one. So the product would be (B*MAD)*10. So when written as R A E, that's the value of B*MAD, but the shifted one would be RAE0 (since shifted left by one). Wait, perhaps the RAE is the product B*MAD, and when shifted left, it becomes RAE0. Then adding to MAD (the first partial product) gives AMID. Wait, but in the problem's setup, the second partial product is written as R A E, which is aligned so that when added to the first partial product (MAD), the digits line up properly. Let me think of the standard multiplication layout.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n       M A D\n     x   B E\n     ---------\n       M A D   (E * M A D)\n     + R A E   (B * M A D, shifted left by one)\n     ---------\n     = A M I D\n\nWait, the second partial product (from B) is shifted left by one, so when written, it's actually R A E followed by a zero? Wait no, the way the multiplication is written, the second partial product (from B) is shifted left by one digit, so the RAE is actually the product of B*MAD, but when written down, it's shifted so that the units digit (the E) is in the tens place. Wait, perhaps the RAE is the product of B*MAD, which is a three-digit number, and when shifted left by one, it becomes a four-digit number R A E 0, but that would mean the addition would be:\n\n    M A D\n  + R A E 0\n  ---------\n  A M I D\n\nBut the final result is a four-digit number A M I D. Wait, so the total must be four digits, so the sum of the two partial products must be four digits. The first partial product (MAD) is three digits, and the second (RAE shifted left) is four digits (since shifted left once). Wait, but adding a three-digit and a four-digit number gives a four-digit result? That would require that the four-digit number (RAE0) is such that when added to MAD (three digits), the total is four digits, which would mean that the first digit of RAE0 plus any carryover from the addition of the other digits gives the first digit A.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to approach this step by step.\n\nLet me first consider the first partial product: E * MAD = MAD. So E must be 1. Because if E is 1, then multiplying by E gives the same number. If E were any other number, unless there's a carryover that somehow cancels out, which is hard to see.\n\nAssuming E =1, then the first partial product is indeed MAD. That gives E=1.\n\nNow the second partial product is B*MAD, and when shifted left (so multiplied by 10), it's written as R A E (but shifted left, so actually R A E 0? Wait no, the way it's written in the problem, the second partial product is R A E, but since it's the B (tens digit) multiplied, it's shifted left by one. So the actual value of B*MAD must be R A E, but when shifted left, it's R A E 0. Then adding the first partial product (M A D) gives the total A M I D.\n\nWait, but in the problem's setup, the addition is written as:\n\nMAD (three digits)\n+ RAE shifted left (so four digits, but written as R A E in the next line shifted, so like:\n\n   M A D\n+  R A E\n----------\nA M I D\n\nBut actually, the alignment would be:\n\n      M A D\n    x   B E\n    ---------\n      M A D   (E*MAD)\n    + R A E   (B*MAD shifted left by 1)\n    ---------\n    A M I D\n\nSo when adding, the units digit of the first partial product (D) is in the units place, while the second partial product (from B*MAD shifted left) has its units digit in the tens place. Therefore, the second partial product's units digit (the E in RAE) is actually in the tens place of the total sum. Wait, that might be confusing. Let me think in terms of digit positions.\n\nLet me denote the numbers as:\n\nFirst partial product (E*MAD) is M A D (three digits).\n\nSecond partial product (B*MAD) is R A E (three digits), but shifted left by one digit, so when written as part of the addition, it's aligned to the left, so the R is in the hundreds place, A in tens, E in units? Wait no, shifting left by one would mean that the units digit of B*MAD (the RAE) is in the tens place. Wait maybe I should write the addition vertically.\n\nLet me try to align the digits properly:\n\nThe first partial product (from E*MAD) is:\n\n   M  A  D\n+  R  A  E  (but shifted left by one, so it's actually R A E 0)\n------------\nA  M  I  D\n\nWait, perhaps the second partial product is shifted left by one, meaning that the RAE is actually in the hundreds, tens, and units places shifted? Let me think of an example. Suppose MAD is 123, B is 4, so B*MAD is 492. Then, when multiplied by 10 (since it's the tens digit), it would be 4920. But in the problem's setup, the second partial product is written as R A E, which would be 492, but shifted left, so 4920. Then adding 123 + 4920 gives 5043. The total would be 5043. So in this case, the alignment would be:\n\n   123\n+4920\n-----\n5043\n\nSo the second partial product's digits are 4 9 2 0, but written as 492 shifted left, meaning the 0 is in the units place, but since we can't write the zero, it's just shifted. So in the problem's terms, the RAE would be 492 (since B*MAD is 492, then shifted becomes 4920). So R is 4, A is 9, E is 2. Wait, but in the problem's setup, the second partial product (from B) is written as R A E. So in this example, R is 4, A is 9, E is 2, which would correspond to the digits of B*MAD (the 492). So the shifted version is 4920, but the RAE is the digits of B*MAD, not shifted.\n\nTherefore, in the problem, the second partial product's value is B*MAD = R A E (three digits). When shifted left by one (multiplied by 10), it's R A E 0. So the total is (E*MAD) + (B*MAD)*10 = (E + B*10)*MAD = (BE)*MAD = AMID.\n\nSo the total is (BE) * (MAD) = AMID.\n\nSo the total product is a four-digit number A M I D.\n\nSo now, let's start with the first assumption that E=1. Let's see if that works.\n\nSo E is 1. Then the first partial product is MAD * 1 = MAD. The second partial product is B*MAD = R A 1 (since E is 1, so the last digit of B*MAD must be 1? Wait, because the second partial product's last digit is E, which is 1. So the units digit of B*MAD must be 1. So B*MAD ends with 1. Since the units digit of MAD is D, then B*D must end with 1 (since the units digit comes from B multiplied by D, with possible carryover from previous digits? Wait, actually, when you multiply B by MAD, the units digit of that product is the units digit of B * D. Because B is multiplied by each digit of MAD, so units digit comes from B*D. So that must end with 1. So B * D mod 10 = 1.\n\nPossible pairs (B,D) such that their product ends with 1. Since B and D are digits (0-9), possible combinations are (1,1), (3,7), (7,3), (9,9). But since all letters represent different digits? Wait, the problem doesn't say that all letters are different. Hmm. Wait, maybe some letters can be same? The problem says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" but doesn't specify uniqueness. Hmm, but in typical cryptarithmetic puzzles, each letter represents a unique digit. Maybe that's a safe assumption here. So assuming all letters are unique digits.\n\nSo B and D must multiply to end with 1, with B and D different, and not equal to E (which is 1). So possible options are:\n\nB=3, D=7 (3*7=21 \u2192 ends with 1)\n\nB=7, D=3 (7*3=21 \u2192 same)\n\nB=9, D=9 (but they must be different, so no)\n\nB= 9 and D=9 is same, so not allowed. B= 1 and D=1, but E is already 1, so they can't be. So possible pairs are (3,7) or (7,3).\n\nSo that's a start. Let's consider those possibilities.\n\nLet me note that the total product is AMID. The first digit A comes from the first digit of the total sum. Since the total is (B*MAD)*10 + MAD = (B*10 + E)*MAD = BE * MAD = AMID. Since BE is a two-digit number and MAD is three-digit, their product is four-digit. So BE*MAD is between 10*100 = 1000 and 99*999=98901, but since the product is four digits, BE*MAD is between 1000 and 9999. So BE can be up to 99, but even 99*999 is way over. Wait, but the product AMID is four digits, so BE must be small enough so that BE*MAD is four digits. So BE could be up to, say, 99 but then MAD must be small. Hmm, but let's see.\n\nAlso, the first digit of the product is A. The first digit of the product comes from the leading digits of BE*MAD. Since when multiplying, the leading digit A is the first digit of the product, which is determined by the leading digits of BE and MAD. But maybe we can find more constraints.\n\nNow, let's also look at the addition of the two partial products:\n\nMAD (the first partial product) plus (B*MAD)*10 (the second partial product shifted) equals AMID.\n\nWait, actually, the second partial product shifted left by one is (B*MAD)*10. So the total is (E*MAD) + (B*MAD)*10 = (E + 10*B)*MAD = (BE)*MAD = AMID.\n\nSo that's consistent.\n\nNow, looking at the addition step:\n\nThe units digit of the total AMID is D. The units digit of the sum comes from the units digits of the two partial products. The first partial product's units digit is D (from MAD), and the second partial product (shifted left) has its units digit as 0 (since it's multiplied by 10). Wait, no. Wait the second partial product when shifted left by one would have its units digit in the tens place. Wait, perhaps I need to think digit by digit.\n\nLet me break down the addition digit by digit. Let me write the two partial products:\n\nFirst partial product (E*MAD): M A D\n\nSecond partial product (B*MAD shifted left by one): R A E 0 (since shifted left by one, so adding a zero at the end, but in the problem's setup it's written as R A E in the next line shifted, so the actual digits when added would be:\n\n       M A D\n    + R A E 0\n    -----------\n       A M I D\n\nSo adding the units digits: D (from first) + 0 (from second) = D. Which matches the units digit of the total. That's okay.\n\nTens digit: A (from first) + E (from second) must end with I. So (A + E) mod 10 = I. The carryover from the units digit is 0 (since D+0=D). So carryover here could be (A + E)/10 if the sum is over 10.\n\nHundreds digit: M (from first) + A (from second) plus any carryover from the tens digit must equal the hundreds digit of the total, which is I? Wait, the total's hundreds digit is I. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait the total is A M I D. So the thousands digit is A, hundreds is M, tens is I, units is D. So the hundreds digit in the sum must be M. Let me check:\n\nWait the first partial product (MAD) has hundreds digit M, tens A, units D.\n\nThe second partial product shifted left (R A E 0) has hundreds digit A (since it's R A E 0: the digits are thousands: R, hundreds: A, tens: E, units:0). Wait, no. Wait R A E 0 would be four digits: R (thousands), A (hundreds), E (tens), 0 (units). So when adding:\n\nFirst partial product: M (hundreds), A (tens), D (units).\n\nSecond partial product shifted: R (thousands), A (hundreds), E (tens), 0 (units).\n\nSo when adding:\n\nUnits: D + 0 = D \u2192 matches.\n\nTens place: A (from first) + E (from second) \u2192 the total's tens digit is I. So (A + E) mod10 = I, and carryover is (A+E)/10.\n\nHundreds place: M (from first) + A (from second) + carryover from tens \u2192 must equal the hundreds digit of the total, which is M. So:\n\nM + A + carryover_tens = M + 10 * carryover_hundreds ?\n\nWait, the total's hundreds digit is M. The sum here is (M + A + carryover_tens). The result's hundreds digit is M, so:\n\n(M + A + carryover_tens) mod10 = M.\n\nTherefore, (A + carryover_tens) mod10 must be 0. So A + carryover_tens is a multiple of 10. So A + carryover_tens = 10 or 20 (since carryover_tens can be at most (A + E)/10. Since A and E are digits (max 9 each), their sum can be at most 18, so carryover_tens is at most 1. Wait E is 1, so A +1 can be up to 10 (if A is 9, then A +1=10, carryover_tens is 1. So maximum carryover_tens is 1.\n\nTherefore, A + carryover_tens must be 10. Because A is a digit (0-9), and carryover_tens can be 0 or 1. So possible scenarios:\n\nCase 1: carryover_tens is 1, then A +1 = 10 \u2192 A =9.\n\nCase 2: carryover_tens is 0, then A =10 \u2192 impossible, since A is a digit. So only case 1 is possible. Therefore:\n\nA must be 9, and carryover_tens is 1. Because A + carryover_tens =10.\n\nSo that gives A=9, and carryover from tens digit is 1.\n\nNow, since carryover_tens is 1, that comes from the tens digit sum: A + E = I + 10*carryover_tens. Wait, the sum of the tens digits is A + E. The result's tens digit is I, and the carryover is 1. Therefore:\n\nA + E = I + 10*1 \u2192 I = A + E -10.\n\nSince A is 9 and E is 1, substituting:\n\nI = 9 + 1 -10 = 0.\n\nSo I is 0.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nA =9, E=1, I=0.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds digit:\n\nThe sum in hundreds place is M (from first partial product) + A (from the shifted second partial product's hundreds digit) plus the carryover from tens (which is 1) must equal the hundreds digit of the total, which is M. So:\n\nM + 9 + 1 \u2261 M mod10 ?\n\nWait, the hundreds digit of the total is M, so:\n\n(M + 9 +1) mod10 = M mod10 \u2192 (M +10) mod10 = M mod10 \u2192 which is true. So that checks out. But there's also the carryover to the thousands place. The total of the hundreds place is M +9 +1 = M +10. So the actual value is M +10, which would contribute a carryover of 1 to the thousands place.\n\nNow, the thousands digit:\n\nThe first partial product has no thousands digit, so the only contributions are from the second partial product's thousands digit (R) plus any carryover from the hundreds place (which is 1). The total's thousands digit is A, which is 9. So:\n\nR + 1 (carryover) = 9 (the thousands digit of the total). So R must be 8, because 8 +1 =9.\n\nTherefore R is 8.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\nA=9, E=1, I=0, R=8.\n\nNow let's recap:\n\nLetters so far:\n\nM: ?\n\nA:9\n\nD: ?\n\nB: ?\n\nE:1\n\nR:8\n\nI:0\n\nWe also know that E=1, so E is 1, which is fixed.\n\nAlso, from earlier, B*D ends with 1. Since B and D must be digits different from each other and different from the letters we've assigned (A=9, E=1, R=8, I=0). So available digits are 2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nEarlier, possible B and D pairs are (3,7) or (7,3), since their product ends with 1. Let's consider those.\n\nCase 1: B=3, D=7\n\nCase 2: B=7, D=3\n\nLet me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider Case1: B=3, D=7.\n\nWe need to find M such that:\n\nThe second partial product is B*MAD = R A E \u2192 which is 8 9 1 (since R=8, A=9, E=1). So B*MAD = 891.\n\nGiven B=3, so 3*MAD=891 \u2192 MAD = 891 /3 = 297.\n\nSo MAD is 297 \u2192 M=2, A=9 (which matches our A=9), D=7 (which matches D=7).\n\nSo this works! Let's check all the letters:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7.\n\nB=3, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nCheck if all letters are unique: M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8, I=0. Yes, all different. Good.\n\nNow let's check the total product:\n\nBE is 31 (B=3, E=1). MAD is 297. 31 * 297 = ?\n\nLet me compute 30*297 = 8910, minus 297 \u2192 8910-297=8613? Wait, wait:\n\nWait 31 \u00d7 297:\n\nBreakdown: 30\u00d7297 = 8910, plus 1\u00d7297 = 297 \u2192 total 8910+297 = 9207.\n\nWait, the total product should be AMID, which with A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7 \u2192 9207. Which matches 9207. So yes. That's correct.\n\nNow let's check the partial products:\n\nFirst partial product: E*MAD =1\u00d7297 =297 \u2192 M A D (2 9 7) which matches.\n\nSecond partial product: B*MAD =3\u00d7297 =891 \u2192 which is R A E (8 9 1). So R is 8, A=9, E=1. Correct. Then when shifted left by one, it becomes 8910, adding to 297:\n\n297 + 8910 = 9207 \u2192 which is AMID (9 2 0 7). Perfect. All digits match.\n\nSo this case works. Let me check the options given.\n\nThe options are four numbers each. The question says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options are labeled A to E with four digits each. The question probably asks for the values of M, A, D, B, E, R, I in some order? Wait, the options have four numbers each, so maybe the question is asking for the four-digit number AMID, but the options have four digits each, like 9 2 0 7 is option D. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0\n\nB)9 2 0 9\n\nC)9 2 0 1\n\nD)9 2 0 7\n\nE)9 2 2 2\n\nAh! The options are four numbers each, probably representing the digits of AMID. Because AMID is a four-digit number. The first digit A is 9, second M is 2, third I is 0, fourth D is7. So AMID is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options represent M, A, D, B? But the options have four digits each, but there are more letters. Wait the problem says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" so the question might be asking for the values of M, A, D, B, E, R, I? But the options only have four numbers. Wait perhaps the question is asking for the values of M, A, D, B, E, R, I in the order given by the options? Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options are labeled A to E, each with four digits. The problem's title mentions \"multiplication table\" but in the context, it's a multiplication problem with letters. The options are probably the four-digit number AMID, since that's the final product. The options D is 9207, which matches our solution. So the answer is D.\n\nWait but let me check the other case where B=7 and D=3, just to be thorough.\n\nCase2: B=7, D=3.\n\nThen, the second partial product B*MAD = R A E \u2192 which is 8 9 1 (since R=8, A=9, E=1). So 7*MAD = 891 \u2192 MAD =891 /7. Let's compute that: 7\u00d7127=889, 7\u00d7128=896 \u2192 891 divided by7 is not an integer. So that's not possible. So this case is invalid. Thus, only the first case works.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is D) 9 2 0 7.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this multiplication table problem. The question gives a multiplication setup with some letters and a result. The options are numbers for M, A, D, B, E, R, I. Wait, the options are four numbers each, so maybe each represents M, A, D, B, E, R, I? Wait, the options have four numbers each. The problem's options are labeled A to E, each with four digits. Hmm, the question says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options probably correspond to the values of M, A, D, B, E, R, I, but maybe each option lists four digits, perhaps the key letters? Let me check the question again.\n\nThe problem's setup is:\n\n   M A D\nx    B E\n-------------\n   M A D    (this is the first partial product, from E multiplied)\n+ R A E     (this is the second partial product, from B multiplied, shifted left by one)\n-------------\n= A M I D    (the final product)\n\nSo the multiplication is (MAD) * (BE) = AMID. The partial products are MAD (from E * MAD) and RAE (from B * MAD, shifted left by one place). Adding those two gives AMID.\n\nHmm. So we need to find digits for each letter such that when you multiply the three-digit number MAD by the two-digit BE, you get the four-digit number AMID, and the partial products are as shown.\n\nFirst, let's note that the letters involved are M, A, D, B, E, R, I. Each letter represents a unique digit, probably from 0-9, but with some constraints. For example, the first digit of a number can't be zero. So M, B, A can't be zero. Also, the final product AMID starts with A, so A is the first digit, so A can't be zero either.\n\nLooking at the first partial product: when you multiply MAD by E, you get MAD again. Wait, that's interesting. So E must be 1, because multiplying by 1 leaves the number the same. But wait, unless there's a carryover? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the first partial product is MAD. That comes from E multiplied by MAD. So E * MAD = MAD. That suggests that E must be 1, right? Because 1 times any number is the number itself. But could there be a carryover? Let me think. Suppose E is 1, then yes. But if E is higher, but with some carries, maybe? Let's see. For example, if E is 6 and MAD is 105, then 105*6 = 630, which is different. So that can't be. So the only way that E * MAD equals MAD is if E is 1, and there are no carryover digits. Otherwise, the product would be different. So maybe E is 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a carryover that cancels out? Hmm, that's possible, but it's tricky. Let's tentatively assume E is 1.\n\nSo E = 1.\n\nThen, the second partial product is RAE, which comes from multiplying MAD by B, shifted left by one (so multiplied by 10). So B * MAD = RAE * 10? Wait, no, actually, when you multiply by the tens digit (B), you shift left one, so the result of B*MAD would be RAE (but written shifted left, so when added to the first partial product, which is MAD, the total would be AMID.\n\nWait, the second partial product is written as R A E, but since it's multiplied by the B (the tens place of BE), it's actually B*MAD shifted left by one. So the product would be (B*MAD)*10. So when written as R A E, that's the value of B*MAD, but the shifted one would be RAE0 (since shifted left by one). Wait, perhaps the RAE is the product B*MAD, and when shifted left, it becomes RAE0. Then adding to MAD (the first partial product) gives AMID. Wait, but in the problem's setup, the second partial product is written as R A E, which is aligned so that when added to the first partial product (MAD), the digits line up properly. Let me think of the standard multiplication layout.\n\nLet me write it out:\n\n       M A D\n     x   B E\n     ---------\n       M A D   (E * M A D)\n     + R A E   (B * M A D, shifted left by one)\n     ---------\n     = A M I D\n\nWait, the second partial product (from B) is shifted left by one, so when written, it's actually R A E followed by a zero? Wait no, the way the multiplication is written, the second partial product (from B) is shifted left by one digit, so the RAE is actually the product of B*MAD, but when written down, it's shifted so that the units digit (the E) is in the tens place. Wait, perhaps the RAE is the product of B*MAD, which is a three-digit number, and when shifted left by one, it becomes a four-digit number R A E 0, but that would mean the addition would be:\n\n    M A D\n  + R A E 0\n  ---------\n  A M I D\n\nBut the final result is a four-digit number A M I D. Wait, so the total must be four digits, so the sum of the two partial products must be four digits. The first partial product (MAD) is three digits, and the second (RAE shifted left) is four digits (since shifted left once). Wait, but adding a three-digit and a four-digit number gives a four-digit result? That would require that the four-digit number (RAE0) is such that when added to MAD (three digits), the total is four digits, which would mean that the first digit of RAE0 plus any carryover from the addition of the other digits gives the first digit A.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to approach this step by step.\n\nLet me first consider the first partial product: E * MAD = MAD. So E must be 1. Because if E is 1, then multiplying by E gives the same number. If E were any other number, unless there's a carryover that somehow cancels out, which is hard to see.\n\nAssuming E =1, then the first partial product is indeed MAD. That gives E=1.\n\nNow the second partial product is B*MAD, and when shifted left (so multiplied by 10), it's written as R A E (but shifted left, so actually R A E 0? Wait no, the way it's written in the problem, the second partial product is R A E, but since it's the B (tens digit) multiplied, it's shifted left by one. So the actual value of B*MAD must be R A E, but when shifted left, it's R A E 0. Then adding the first partial product (M A D) gives the total A M I D.\n\nWait, but in the problem's setup, the addition is written as:\n\nMAD (three digits)\n+ RAE shifted left (so four digits, but written as R A E in the next line shifted, so like:\n\n   M A D\n+  R A E\n----------\nA M I D\n\nBut actually, the alignment would be:\n\n      M A D\n    x   B E\n    ---------\n      M A D   (E*MAD)\n    + R A E   (B*MAD shifted left by 1)\n    ---------\n    A M I D\n\nSo when adding, the units digit of the first partial product (D) is in the units place, while the second partial product (from B*MAD shifted left) has its units digit in the tens place. Therefore, the second partial product's units digit (the E in RAE) is actually in the tens place of the total sum. Wait, that might be confusing. Let me think in terms of digit positions.\n\nLet me denote the numbers as:\n\nFirst partial product (E*MAD) is M A D (three digits).\n\nSecond partial product (B*MAD) is R A E (three digits), but shifted left by one digit, so when written as part of the addition, it's aligned to the left, so the R is in the hundreds place, A in tens, E in units? Wait no, shifting left by one would mean that the units digit of B*MAD (the RAE) is in the tens place. Wait maybe I should write the addition vertically.\n\nLet me try to align the digits properly:\n\nThe first partial product (from E*MAD) is:\n\n   M  A  D\n+  R  A  E  (but shifted left by one, so it's actually R A E 0)\n------------\nA  M  I  D\n\nWait, perhaps the second partial product is shifted left by one, meaning that the RAE is actually in the hundreds, tens, and units places shifted? Let me think of an example. Suppose MAD is 123, B is 4, so B*MAD is 492. Then, when multiplied by 10 (since it's the tens digit), it would be 4920. But in the problem's setup, the second partial product is written as R A E, which would be 492, but shifted left, so 4920. Then adding 123 + 4920 gives 5043. The total would be 5043. So in this case, the alignment would be:\n\n   123\n+4920\n-----\n5043\n\nSo the second partial product's digits are 4 9 2 0, but written as 492 shifted left, meaning the 0 is in the units place, but since we can't write the zero, it's just shifted. So in the problem's terms, the RAE would be 492 (since B*MAD is 492, then shifted becomes 4920). So R is 4, A is 9, E is 2. Wait, but in the problem's setup, the second partial product (from B) is written as R A E. So in this example, R is 4, A is 9, E is 2, which would correspond to the digits of B*MAD (the 492). So the shifted version is 4920, but the RAE is the digits of B*MAD, not shifted.\n\nTherefore, in the problem, the second partial product's value is B*MAD = R A E (three digits). When shifted left by one (multiplied by 10), it's R A E 0. So the total is (E*MAD) + (B*MAD)*10 = (E + B*10)*MAD = (BE)*MAD = AMID.\n\nSo the total is (BE) * (MAD) = AMID.\n\nSo the total product is a four-digit number A M I D.\n\nSo now, let's start with the first assumption that E=1. Let's see if that works.\n\nSo E is 1. Then the first partial product is MAD * 1 = MAD. The second partial product is B*MAD = R A 1 (since E is 1, so the last digit of B*MAD must be 1? Wait, because the second partial product's last digit is E, which is 1. So the units digit of B*MAD must be 1. So B*MAD ends with 1. Since the units digit of MAD is D, then B*D must end with 1 (since the units digit comes from B multiplied by D, with possible carryover from previous digits? Wait, actually, when you multiply B by MAD, the units digit of that product is the units digit of B * D. Because B is multiplied by each digit of MAD, so units digit comes from B*D. So that must end with 1. So B * D mod 10 = 1.\n\nPossible pairs (B,D) such that their product ends with 1. Since B and D are digits (0-9), possible combinations are (1,1), (3,7), (7,3), (9,9). But since all letters represent different digits? Wait, the problem doesn't say that all letters are different. Hmm. Wait, maybe some letters can be same? The problem says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" but doesn't specify uniqueness. Hmm, but in typical cryptarithmetic puzzles, each letter represents a unique digit. Maybe that's a safe assumption here. So assuming all letters are unique digits.\n\nSo B and D must multiply to end with 1, with B and D different, and not equal to E (which is 1). So possible options are:\n\nB=3, D=7 (3*7=21 \u2192 ends with 1)\n\nB=7, D=3 (7*3=21 \u2192 same)\n\nB=9, D=9 (but they must be different, so no)\n\nB= 9 and D=9 is same, so not allowed. B= 1 and D=1, but E is already 1, so they can't be. So possible pairs are (3,7) or (7,3).\n\nSo that's a start. Let's consider those possibilities.\n\nLet me note that the total product is AMID. The first digit A comes from the first digit of the total sum. Since the total is (B*MAD)*10 + MAD = (B*10 + E)*MAD = BE * MAD = AMID. Since BE is a two-digit number and MAD is three-digit, their product is four-digit. So BE*MAD is between 10*100 = 1000 and 99*999=98901, but since the product is four digits, BE*MAD is between 1000 and 9999. So BE can be up to 99, but even 99*999 is way over. Wait, but the product AMID is four digits, so BE must be small enough so that BE*MAD is four digits. So BE could be up to, say, 99 but then MAD must be small. Hmm, but let's see.\n\nAlso, the first digit of the product is A. The first digit of the product comes from the leading digits of BE*MAD. Since when multiplying, the leading digit A is the first digit of the product, which is determined by the leading digits of BE and MAD. But maybe we can find more constraints.\n\nNow, let's also look at the addition of the two partial products:\n\nMAD (the first partial product) plus (B*MAD)*10 (the second partial product shifted) equals AMID.\n\nWait, actually, the second partial product shifted left by one is (B*MAD)*10. So the total is (E*MAD) + (B*MAD)*10 = (E + 10*B)*MAD = (BE)*MAD = AMID.\n\nSo that's consistent.\n\nNow, looking at the addition step:\n\nThe units digit of the total AMID is D. The units digit of the sum comes from the units digits of the two partial products. The first partial product's units digit is D (from MAD), and the second partial product (shifted left) has its units digit as 0 (since it's multiplied by 10). Wait, no. Wait the second partial product when shifted left by one would have its units digit in the tens place. Wait, perhaps I need to think digit by digit.\n\nLet me break down the addition digit by digit. Let me write the two partial products:\n\nFirst partial product (E*MAD): M A D\n\nSecond partial product (B*MAD shifted left by one): R A E 0 (since shifted left by one, so adding a zero at the end, but in the problem's setup it's written as R A E in the next line shifted, so the actual digits when added would be:\n\n       M A D\n    + R A E 0\n    -----------\n       A M I D\n\nSo adding the units digits: D (from first) + 0 (from second) = D. Which matches the units digit of the total. That's okay.\n\nTens digit: A (from first) + E (from second) must end with I. So (A + E) mod 10 = I. The carryover from the units digit is 0 (since D+0=D). So carryover here could be (A + E)/10 if the sum is over 10.\n\nHundreds digit: M (from first) + A (from second) plus any carryover from the tens digit must equal the hundreds digit of the total, which is I? Wait, the total's hundreds digit is I. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait the total is A M I D. So the thousands digit is A, hundreds is M, tens is I, units is D. So the hundreds digit in the sum must be M. Let me check:\n\nWait the first partial product (MAD) has hundreds digit M, tens A, units D.\n\nThe second partial product shifted left (R A E 0) has hundreds digit A (since it's R A E 0: the digits are thousands: R, hundreds: A, tens: E, units:0). Wait, no. Wait R A E 0 would be four digits: R (thousands), A (hundreds), E (tens), 0 (units). So when adding:\n\nFirst partial product: M (hundreds), A (tens), D (units).\n\nSecond partial product shifted: R (thousands), A (hundreds), E (tens), 0 (units).\n\nSo when adding:\n\nUnits: D + 0 = D \u2192 matches.\n\nTens place: A (from first) + E (from second) \u2192 the total's tens digit is I. So (A + E) mod10 = I, and carryover is (A+E)/10.\n\nHundreds place: M (from first) + A (from second) + carryover from tens \u2192 must equal the hundreds digit of the total, which is M. So:\n\nM + A + carryover_tens = M + 10 * carryover_hundreds ?\n\nWait, the total's hundreds digit is M. The sum here is (M + A + carryover_tens). The result's hundreds digit is M, so:\n\n(M + A + carryover_tens) mod10 = M.\n\nTherefore, (A + carryover_tens) mod10 must be 0. So A + carryover_tens is a multiple of 10. So A + carryover_tens = 10 or 20 (since carryover_tens can be at most (A + E)/10. Since A and E are digits (max 9 each), their sum can be at most 18, so carryover_tens is at most 1. Wait E is 1, so A +1 can be up to 10 (if A is 9, then A +1=10, carryover_tens is 1. So maximum carryover_tens is 1.\n\nTherefore, A + carryover_tens must be 10. Because A is a digit (0-9), and carryover_tens can be 0 or 1. So possible scenarios:\n\nCase 1: carryover_tens is 1, then A +1 = 10 \u2192 A =9.\n\nCase 2: carryover_tens is 0, then A =10 \u2192 impossible, since A is a digit. So only case 1 is possible. Therefore:\n\nA must be 9, and carryover_tens is 1. Because A + carryover_tens =10.\n\nSo that gives A=9, and carryover from tens digit is 1.\n\nNow, since carryover_tens is 1, that comes from the tens digit sum: A + E = I + 10*carryover_tens. Wait, the sum of the tens digits is A + E. The result's tens digit is I, and the carryover is 1. Therefore:\n\nA + E = I + 10*1 \u2192 I = A + E -10.\n\nSince A is 9 and E is 1, substituting:\n\nI = 9 + 1 -10 = 0.\n\nSo I is 0.\n\nSo now, we have:\n\nA =9, E=1, I=0.\n\nNow, moving on to the hundreds digit:\n\nThe sum in hundreds place is M (from first partial product) + A (from the shifted second partial product's hundreds digit) plus the carryover from tens (which is 1) must equal the hundreds digit of the total, which is M. So:\n\nM + 9 + 1 \u2261 M mod10 ?\n\nWait, the hundreds digit of the total is M, so:\n\n(M + 9 +1) mod10 = M mod10 \u2192 (M +10) mod10 = M mod10 \u2192 which is true. So that checks out. But there's also the carryover to the thousands place. The total of the hundreds place is M +9 +1 = M +10. So the actual value is M +10, which would contribute a carryover of 1 to the thousands place.\n\nNow, the thousands digit:\n\nThe first partial product has no thousands digit, so the only contributions are from the second partial product's thousands digit (R) plus any carryover from the hundreds place (which is 1). The total's thousands digit is A, which is 9. So:\n\nR + 1 (carryover) = 9 (the thousands digit of the total). So R must be 8, because 8 +1 =9.\n\nTherefore R is 8.\n\nSo far, we have:\n\nA=9, E=1, I=0, R=8.\n\nNow let's recap:\n\nLetters so far:\n\nM: ?\n\nA:9\n\nD: ?\n\nB: ?\n\nE:1\n\nR:8\n\nI:0\n\nWe also know that E=1, so E is 1, which is fixed.\n\nAlso, from earlier, B*D ends with 1. Since B and D must be digits different from each other and different from the letters we've assigned (A=9, E=1, R=8, I=0). So available digits are 2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nEarlier, possible B and D pairs are (3,7) or (7,3), since their product ends with 1. Let's consider those.\n\nCase 1: B=3, D=7\n\nCase 2: B=7, D=3\n\nLet me check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's consider Case1: B=3, D=7.\n\nWe need to find M such that:\n\nThe second partial product is B*MAD = R A E \u2192 which is 8 9 1 (since R=8, A=9, E=1). So B*MAD = 891.\n\nGiven B=3, so 3*MAD=891 \u2192 MAD = 891 /3 = 297.\n\nSo MAD is 297 \u2192 M=2, A=9 (which matches our A=9), D=7 (which matches D=7).\n\nSo this works! Let's check all the letters:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7.\n\nB=3, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nCheck if all letters are unique: M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8, I=0. Yes, all different. Good.\n\nNow let's check the total product:\n\nBE is 31 (B=3, E=1). MAD is 297. 31 * 297 = ?\n\nLet me compute 30*297 = 8910, minus 297 \u2192 8910-297=8613? Wait, wait:\n\nWait 31 \u00d7 297:\n\nBreakdown: 30\u00d7297 = 8910, plus 1\u00d7297 = 297 \u2192 total 8910+297 = 9207.\n\nWait, the total product should be AMID, which with A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7 \u2192 9207. Which matches 9207. So yes. That's correct.\n\nNow let's check the partial products:\n\nFirst partial product: E*MAD =1\u00d7297 =297 \u2192 M A D (2 9 7) which matches.\n\nSecond partial product: B*MAD =3\u00d7297 =891 \u2192 which is R A E (8 9 1). So R is 8, A=9, E=1. Correct. Then when shifted left by one, it becomes 8910, adding to 297:\n\n297 + 8910 = 9207 \u2192 which is AMID (9 2 0 7). Perfect. All digits match.\n\nSo this case works. Let me check the options given.\n\nThe options are four numbers each. The question says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options are labeled A to E with four digits each. The question probably asks for the values of M, A, D, B, E, R, I in some order? Wait, the options have four numbers each, so maybe the question is asking for the four-digit number AMID, but the options have four digits each, like 9 2 0 7 is option D. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0\n\nB)9 2 0 9\n\nC)9 2 0 1\n\nD)9 2 0 7\n\nE)9 2 2 2\n\nAh! The options are four numbers each, probably representing the digits of AMID. Because AMID is a four-digit number. The first digit A is 9, second M is 2, third I is 0, fourth D is7. So AMID is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the options represent M, A, D, B? But the options have four digits each, but there are more letters. Wait the problem says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" so the question might be asking for the values of M, A, D, B, E, R, I? But the options only have four numbers. Wait perhaps the question is asking for the values of M, A, D, B, E, R, I in the order given by the options? Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options are labeled A to E, each with four digits. The problem's title mentions \"multiplication table\" but in the context, it's a multiplication problem with letters. The options are probably the four-digit number AMID, since that's the final product. The options D is 9207, which matches our solution. So the answer is D.\n\nWait but let me check the other case where B=7 and D=3, just to be thorough.\n\nCase2: B=7, D=3.\n\nThen, the second partial product B*MAD = R A E \u2192 which is 8 9 1 (since R=8, A=9, E=1). So 7*MAD = 891 \u2192 MAD =891 /7. Let's compute that: 7\u00d7127=889, 7\u00d7128=896 \u2192 891 divided by7 is not an integer. So that's not possible. So this case is invalid. Thus, only the first case works.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is D) 9 2 0 7.\n\n\nTo solve the multiplication problem, we start by analyzing the given setup:\n\n```\n    M A D\n  x   B E\n  ---------\n    M A D   (E \u00d7 MAD)\n  + R A E   (B \u00d7 MAD shifted left by 1)\n  ---------\n  = A M I D\n```\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Determine E**:\n   - The first partial product \\( E \\times MAD = MAD \\). This implies \\( E = 1 \\) (since multiplying by 1 leaves the number unchanged).\n\n2. **Analyze the second partial product**:\n   - The second partial product \\( B \\times MAD = RAE \\). The units digit of \\( B \\times D \\) must be \\( E = 1 \\). Possible pairs \\((B, D)\\) are \\((3, 7)\\) or \\((7, 3)\\).\n\n3. **Determine A and I**:\n   - The units digit of the total product \\( AMID \\) is \\( D \\). The tens digit \\( I \\) comes from \\( A + E \\) (modulo 10), with a carryover of 1. Solving \\( A + 1 = 10 \\) gives \\( A = 9 \\) and \\( I = 0 \\).\n\n4. **Determine R**:\n   - The thousands digit of the total product is \\( A = 9 \\). This requires \\( R + 1 = 9 \\), so \\( R = 8 \\).\n\n5. **Test valid pairs for \\( B \\) and \\( D \\)**:\n   - **Case 1**: \\( B = 3 \\), \\( D = 7 \\):\n     - \\( B \\times MAD = 891 \\) (since \\( RAE = 891 \\)).\n     - \\( MAD = 891 / 3 = 297 \\), giving \\( M = 2 \\), \\( A = 9 \\), \\( D = 7 \\).\n     - Verify total product: \\( 31 \\times 297 = 9207 \\), matching \\( AMID = 9207 \\).\n   - **Case 2**: \\( B = 7 \\), \\( D = 3 \\) fails as \\( 891 / 7 \\) is not an integer.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe values are \\( M = 2 \\), \\( A = 9 \\), \\( D = 7 \\), \\( B = 3 \\), \\( E = 1 \\), \\( R = 8 \\), and \\( I = 0 \\). The final product \\( AMID \\) is **9207**, corresponding to option **D**.\n\nAnswer: D",
