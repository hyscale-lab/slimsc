      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a man rowing in still water and against the current. I need to find his speed along the current. Hmm, right. So, first, I remember that when dealing with rowing speeds, the basic idea is that the rowing speed in still water is the person's speed without any current. Then, when going against the current (upstream), the effective speed is the rowing speed minus the current's speed. And when going with the current (downstream), it's the rowing speed plus the current's speed. \n\nThe question gives the man's speed in still water as 4 km per hour. His speed against the current is 2 kmph. So I need to find the speed along the current. Let me write down what I know:\n\nLet me denote:\n- Rowing speed in still water = v = 4 km/h\n- Speed against current (upstream) = v - c = 2 km/h, where c is the current's speed.\n- We need to find the speed along the current, which is v + c.\n\nSo first, I can find the current's speed (c) using the upstream speed. \n\nFrom the upstream equation: v - c = 2. Since v is 4, substituting gives 4 - c = 2. Solving for c, subtract 4 from both sides: -c = 2 -4 \u2192 -c = -2 \u2192 c = 2 km/h. \n\nNow, the downstream speed would be v + c = 4 + 2 = 6 km/h. Wait, but looking at the options, B and E are both 6 kmph. Wait, the options list B and E as 6? Let me check the options again. \n\nThe options are A)15, B)6, C)12, D)14, E)6. Oh, maybe a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me go through again. The man's speed in still water is 4. Against the current, his effective speed is 2. So the current's speed must be 4 - 2 = 2. So when going with the current, his speed would be 4 + 2 = 6. That's correct. So the answer should be 6. But the options have both B and E as 6. That's strange. Wait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again.\n\nThe user listed the options as:\n\nA)15 kmph\n\nB)6 kmph\n\nC)12 kmph\n\nD)14 kmph\n\nE)6 kmph\n\nHmm, so both B and E are 6. That's probably a mistake in the options. But maybe I did something wrong? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me re-read it. The question says, \"his rate against the current is 2 kmph\". So upstream is 2, which gives current as 2, so downstream is 6. That's correct. So the answer must be B or E. But since both are same, perhaps it's a typo and one of them is different. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the current's speed is subtracted when going against, so:\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the man's speed in still water is 4 km/h. When going against the current (upstream), his effective speed is (4 - c) = 2. So solving for c gives c = 2. Then downstream speed would be 4 + c = 6. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is 6. So either B or E. Since in the options both B and E are 6, but the problem might have a typo. Wait, maybe the options are presented correctly and I need to check again. Wait, the options as given have E also as 6. That's odd. Maybe it's a duplicate option. But perhaps the correct answer is B, since the options are listed as B and E, but perhaps the user made a mistake in inputting. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in calculation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trickier. Let me think if there's another way. Suppose the rate against the current is 2 kmph. The man's rowing speed is 4 kmph in still water, so the current's speed must be 4 - 2 = 2 kmph. Therefore, with the current, his speed would be 4 + 2 = 6. That's straightforward. So unless there's a different interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is referring to \"rate\" as something else, but I think the standard interpretation is correct. So the answer must be 6. Since both B and E are 6, perhaps there's a mistake in the options, but in the original problem maybe one of them is different. Wait, looking back at the user's input, the options are:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)15 kmph\n\nB)6 kmph\n\nC)12 kmph\n\nD)14 kmph\n\nE)6 kmph\n\nHmm, that's exactly as written. So the options have two 6's. That must be an error. But since the user is asking for an answer, maybe the correct answer is B. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, another way: maybe I confused the formula. Let me think again. Suppose the man's speed in still water is v =4. The speed against current is (v - c)=2. So solving c= v -2 =4-2=2. So downstream speed is v +c =6. So yes, correct. So answer is 6. So the options must have B as correct. Unless the question is from another source where E is the answer, but in this case, since B and E are same, the user probably made a typo. But since the options are as given, perhaps the answer is B? Or maybe the options are presented in a different way. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem. Let me check once more.\n\nWait, maybe the question is saying his rate against the current is 2 kmph. So if his speed in still is 4, then current's speed is 4-2=2. So along the current would be 4+2=6. So that's right. So answer must be B or E. But since the options have two same answers, perhaps the correct one is the first occurrence? Maybe the user intended B as the correct option. Alternatively, perhaps the options are mistyped here. But given the information, I'll go with 6, which is option B.\n",
