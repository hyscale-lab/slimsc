      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is asking about the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. Hmm, right, this sounds like a combination problem. Because when you choose items where the order doesn't matter, you use combinations. Like, if I pick orange A and orange B, that's the same as picking B and A, so we don't want to count those twice.\n\nSo the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n - k)!). Here, n is 10 oranges, and k is 2. Let me plug those numbers in. So 10 factorial over 2 factorial times (10-2) factorial. \n\nWait, calculating factorials might be a bit tedious, but maybe I can simplify it. 10! divided by 8! would leave 10 \u00d79 \u00d78! divided by 8! so the 8! cancels out. Then it's 10\u00d79 divided by 2!. And 2! is 2\u00d71=2. So 10\u00d79 is 90, divided by 2 is 45. Oh right, so the answer should be 45. Let me check the options. Option A is 45. So the answer must be A.\n\nWait a second, could it be a permutation instead? Like, if the order mattered, but the question says \"chosen\", which typically means combinations. For example, if you choose two oranges to eat, it doesn't matter which one you pick first. So yeah, combination is right. So 45 is correct. The options have A as 45. So I think that's the right choice.\n",
