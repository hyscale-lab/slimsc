      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about figuring out the interest rate when someone borrows 360 rupees and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of 31.50 each. Hmm, let me think. Alright, first, I need to calculate the total amount paid back and then find the interest rate from that.\n\nWait, the total amount paid over 12 months would be 12 multiplied by 31.50. Let me compute that. 12 times 30 is 360, and 12 times 1.5 is 18, so total is 360 + 18 = 378. So he paid back 378 rupees in total. The principal was 360, so the interest paid is 378 - 360 = 18 rupees. \n\nNow, to find the interest rate. Since it's monthly installments, maybe it's a simple interest problem? Or is it compound interest? Hmm. The question doesn't specify, but I think maybe they expect simple interest here. Let me check.\n\nIn simple interest, the formula is I = P * R * T, where I is interest, P principal, R rate, T time in years. But here, the time is 1 year (since 12 months). So the total interest over the year is 18. So plugging in, 18 = 360 * R * 1. Solving for R would be 18/(360) = 0.05, so 5%. Wait, that would be D option. But let me think again. \n\nWait, but maybe this is considering the interest as simple interest, but when paying in installments, sometimes it's calculated differently. Like, maybe it's an installment loan where each payment reduces the principal? In that case, it might be an amortizing loan, which would use compound interest. Hmm, but calculating that might be more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the simple interest approach. Let's see. Let me recalculate. The total interest is 18. The principal is 360. So the rate is (18/360)*100 = 5%. So that would be D. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options include 5% as D. But another thought: maybe the question is using simple interest per month? Wait, if the rate is given as an annual rate, then the total interest would be calculated as 360*(r/12)*12 = 360*r. So same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the rate per month? Wait, but the options are all annual rates. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using the concept of simple interest but the time for each payment is different. For example, the first installment is paid after 1 month, so the principal is reduced each month. Wait, but calculating that way would require an amortization schedule. Let me see if that approach would give a different answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the simple interest method where the total interest is calculated on the original principal for one year, which would indeed give 5%, so D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a trick here. Let me think again. \n\nTotal amount paid is 12 * 31.50 = 378. The principal is 360, so total interest is 18. The interest rate per annum would be (18/360)*100 = 5%. So that's 5%, so answer D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting simple interest but calculated on a monthly basis. Wait, but that would still be the same. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the rate to be calculated as (total interest)/ (principal * time). Wait, time is 1 year. So 18/(360 *1) = 0.05, so 5%. \n\nHmm, I think that's correct. So the answer should be D)5%. But wait, the options include 10% as C. Let me think again. Did I miscalculate something?\n\nWait, maybe the question is expecting the rate to be calculated as simple interest per month, and then multiplied by 12? Let me see. \n\nIf the total interest is 18 over the year, then the monthly interest is 1.5 (since 18 divided by 12 is 1.5). The principal is 360. So the monthly rate would be 1.5 / 360 = 0.004166..., which is 0.4166% per month. Multiply by 12 gives 5% per annum. So same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the simple interest formula but considering each installment as part of the calculation. Wait, but in simple interest for installments, perhaps the method is different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the concept of reducing balance. Let me think. If it's an amortized loan, then the interest each month is calculated on the remaining principal. Let's try that approach. \n\nIn that case, the monthly payment is 31.50. The total loan is 360. Let me see if the interest rate is 5% per annum, which is 5/12% per month. Let's compute the monthly rate. 5% per annum is 0.05/12 \u2248 0.0041667 per month. \n\nLet me check if the monthly payment for a 5% annual rate would be 31.50. \n\nThe formula for the monthly payment M on a loan is M = P * (r(1 + r)^n)/[(1 + r)^n -1], where r is the monthly rate and n the number of payments. \n\nHere P = 360, n=12, r=0.05/12. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, calculate r: 0.05 /12 = 0.0041666667. \n\n(1 + r)^12 = (1.0041666667)^12. Let me approximate that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for monthly payments. Alternatively, perhaps this is getting too complicated, but let's see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the simple interest approach, so the answer is D)5%. But let me check the options again. The options are A)1.5, B)4.5, C)10, D)5, E)12. \n\nWait, but if I thought the answer was D, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me try another approach. \n\nSuppose the total amount paid is 378. The principal is 360. So the interest is 18. \n\nIf the question is asking for the rate per annum, then simple interest would be 18/(360 *1) *100 = 5%, so D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the rate to be calculated as simple interest but considering each payment's time. Like, the first installment is paid after 1 month, so the principal for that part is 360, so the interest for that month would be (360 * r/12). But since each payment is equal, perhaps the total interest can be found another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting to compute the simple interest rate for the total period. Since the total interest is 18, and the principal is 360, then 18 is the total interest over the year. So the rate is 5%, so D. \n\nHmm, I think that's right. So the answer must be D. \n\nWait, but let me check if any other option could fit. Let's see, if the rate was 10%, then the interest would be 36, so total amount 396. But the total paid is 378, so that's not it. 4.5% would be 360 *0.045= 16.2, so total 376.2, which is not 378. 5% gives exactly 18, which matches. So yeah, D is correct. \n\nTherefore the answer is D)5%.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about finding the interest rate when someone borrows 360 rupees and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of 31.50 each. Hmm, let me think. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with installment payments, the total amount paid back is more than the principal because of interest. The total amount paid here would be 12 times 31.50. Let me calculate that first. 12 multiplied by 31.50. Let's see, 30 times 12 is 360, and 1.5 times 12 is 18, so total is 360 +18=378. So total repayment is 378. The principal was 360, so the total interest paid is 378-360=18 rupees.\n\nNow, how do I find the interest rate? Since it's monthly installments, maybe it's a simple interest problem? Or is it compound interest? Wait, but simple interest over a year might not apply here directly because the payments are monthly. Hmm, maybe I should consider the simple interest formula. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the simple interest rate per annum. Let's see. The total interest is 18 over the year. So the simple interest formula is I = P * R * T. Here, P is 360, T is 1 year. So 18 = 360 * R * 1. Solving for R would be 18/360 = 0.05, so 5%. That would be option D. But wait, maybe that's too straightforward? Because in reality, when paying monthly installments, the interest is usually calculated on a reducing balance, which would be different. \n\nOh right, so maybe the question is assuming simple interest? Because otherwise, if it's compound interest or reducing balance, the calculation would be more complex. Let me check both approaches. \n\nIf using simple interest: total interest is 18, so the rate would be 5% as above. \n\nAlternatively, if it's compound interest, but since it's monthly payments, maybe the question is expecting the simple interest approach. Because otherwise, calculating the exact rate would require more steps. Let me see what the options are. The options given are 1.5, 4.5, 10,5,12. So 5% is there as D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the simple interest method where total interest is principal multiplied by rate multiplied by time. Since the loan is for a year (12 months), the time is 1. So 360 * R *1 = 18, so R is 5%. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D)5%. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to confirm using another method. Let's think of it as each payment. The total amount paid is 12*31.50 = 378. The principal is 360, so interest is 18. If it's simple interest, then yes, 18/360 = 5% per annum. That makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if it's calculated as monthly rate, but then the total interest would be different. Let me see. Suppose the monthly interest rate is 'r'. Then the present value of the 12 payments should equal the loan amount. The formula for present value of annuity is PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1+r)^-n)/r ] \n\nSo here, PV is 360, PMT is 31.50, n is 12. We can set up the equation: 360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1+r)^-12 ) / r ] \n\nHmm, solving for r here would require trial and error. Let me see if the answer options can be plugged in here. Let's try option D (5% annual rate, so monthly is 5/12% \u22480.4167%). Let me try that. \n\nLet r = 0.05/12 \u22480.0041667 \n\nCompute the present value factor: \n\nFirst, compute (1 - (1 + 0.0041667)^-12 ) / 0.0041667 \n\nCalculate (1 + 0.0041667)^12. Let me approximate that. Since 0.0041667 is 1/240, but maybe easier to compute. Alternatively, (1.0041667)^12. Let me see:\n\nApproximate using the formula (1 + r)^n \u2248 e^(n r) when r is small. But maybe better to calculate step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since 0.0041667 is 0.416667% per month. Let me compute (1.0041667)^12:\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, (1.0041667)^12. Let me note that 1.0041667 is 1 + 0.05/12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if the present value comes to 360. \n\nLet me compute the denominator part:\n\nFirst, compute (1 - (1 + r)^-12)/r \n\nLet me plug in r = 0.0041667 (monthly rate):\n\nFirst compute (1 + r)^12 = (1.0041667)^12. Let me calculate this:\n\nLet me use logarithms. Let me take natural log of (1.0041667)^12 is 12 * ln(1.0041667). \n\nln(1.0041667) \u2248 0.004158 (since ln(1+x) \u2248x -x\u00b2/2, so for small x, it's approx 0.0041667 - (0.0041667)^2/2 \u22480.0041667 - ~0.00000868 \u22480.004158). \n\nSo 12 * 0.004158 \u22480.05. So exp(0.05) \u22481.05127. So (1.0041667)^12 \u22481.05127. \n\nSo (1/(1.05127)) \u22480.9511. \n\nSo 1 - 0.9511 = 0.0489. \n\nThen divide by r (0.0041667):\n\n0.0489 /0.0041667 \u224811.73. \n\nMultiply by PMT 31.50: 11.73 *31.50 \u2248 11.73*30=351.9 plus 11.73*1.5=17.595, total 369.5. Hmm, that's higher than 360. \n\nHmm, so if the monthly rate is 0.41667% (5% annual), then the present value would be approximately 369.5, which is more than 360. So that suggests that the actual rate is higher than 5%? Wait, that can't be. Because if the present value is higher than the loan amount, that would mean that the actual interest rate is lower than 5%. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The present value formula gives PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1+r)^-n ) / r ]\n\nIf the calculated PV with r=0.0041667 is 369.5, but the actual PV is 360, which is less. So that implies that the actual r must be higher than 0.0041667, because a higher r would decrease the PV. \n\nWait, let me see: when r increases, the denominator term (1 - (1+r)^-n)/r decreases, so the PV decreases. So to get a lower PV (360 instead of 369.5), we need a higher r. \n\nHmm, so the actual monthly rate is higher than 0.41667%, so the annual rate would be higher than 5%. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the answer isn't D then. But the options include 5%, which was the simple interest answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting simple interest. Let me see the total interest is 18, so 18/360=5% per annum. That's the simple interest approach. \n\nBut in reality, when paying monthly, the interest is calculated on a reducing balance, so the actual interest rate would be lower? Or higher?\n\nWait, in the simple interest case, the interest is calculated on the principal for the whole year. So total interest is 5% of 360 = 18, which matches. But in the case of monthly payments with reducing balance, the interest would be less, because each month you pay down the principal. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the total interest is still 18. Let me see. Let's try to compute the interest using monthly payments with a reducing balance. \n\nSuppose the rate is monthly, say 'r'. \n\nThe loan is 360. Each month, the payment is 31.50. \n\nThe first month's interest would be 360 * r. The principal paid is 31.50 - 360*r. \n\nSecond month's principal is 360 - (31.50 - 360r) = 360*(1 + r) - 31.50. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to set up the equation for the present value of the payments. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the simple interest approach. Since in that case, the answer is 5%, which is an option, and the calculation is straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using simple interest per annum, so the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the total interest over the year divided by principal, which gives 5%, so that's the nominal rate. \n\nGiven that the options include 5%, and the simple interest calculation gives that, and the problem might be expecting that approach, perhaps that's the right answer. \n\nAlternatively, let me check with another method. Let me think of the total amount paid as 12 *31.50= 378. The interest is 18. \n\nThe simple interest rate would be (Interest / Principal) *100 = (18/360)*100 =5%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \n\nBut the other approach where using present value gives a different result.

      "full_content": "Okay, so the question is about finding the interest rate when someone borrows 360 rupees and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of 31.50 each. Hmm, let me think. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with installment payments, the total amount paid back is more than the principal because of interest. The total amount paid here would be 12 times 31.50. Let me calculate that first. 12 multiplied by 31.50. Let's see, 30 times 12 is 360, and 1.5 times 12 is 18, so total is 360 +18=378. So total repayment is 378. The principal was 360, so the total interest paid is 378-360=18 rupees.\n\nNow, how do I find the interest rate? Since it's monthly installments, maybe it's a simple interest problem? Or is it compound interest? Wait, but simple interest over a year might not apply here directly because the payments are monthly. Hmm, maybe I should consider the simple interest formula. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the simple interest rate per annum. Let's see. The total interest is 18 over the year. So the simple interest formula is I = P * R * T. Here, P is 360, T is 1 year. So 18 = 360 * R * 1. Solving for R would be 18/360 = 0.05, so 5%. That would be option D. But wait, maybe that's too straightforward? Because in reality, when paying monthly installments, the interest is usually calculated on a reducing balance, which would be different. \n\nOh right, so maybe the question is assuming simple interest? Because otherwise, if it's compound interest or reducing balance, the calculation would be more complex. Let me check both approaches. \n\nIf using simple interest: total interest is 18, so the rate would be 5% as above. \n\nAlternatively, if it's compound interest, but since it's monthly payments, maybe the question is expecting the simple interest approach. Because otherwise, calculating the exact rate would require more steps. Let me see what the options are. The options given are 1.5, 4.5, 10,5,12. So 5% is there as D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the simple interest method where total interest is principal multiplied by rate multiplied by time. Since the loan is for a year (12 months), the time is 1. So 360 * R *1 = 18, so R is 5%. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D)5%. \n\nWait, but maybe I need to confirm using another method. Let's think of it as each payment. The total amount paid is 12*31.50 = 378. The principal is 360, so interest is 18. If it's simple interest, then yes, 18/360 = 5% per annum. That makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, if it's calculated as monthly rate, but then the total interest would be different. Let me see. Suppose the monthly interest rate is 'r'. Then the present value of the 12 payments should equal the loan amount. The formula for present value of annuity is PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1+r)^-n)/r ] \n\nSo here, PV is 360, PMT is 31.50, n is 12. We can set up the equation: 360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1+r)^-12 ) / r ] \n\nHmm, solving for r here would require trial and error. Let me see if the answer options can be plugged in here. Let's try option D (5% annual rate, so monthly is 5/12% \u22480.4167%). Let me try that. \n\nLet r = 0.05/12 \u22480.0041667 \n\nCompute the present value factor: \n\nFirst, compute (1 - (1 + 0.0041667)^-12 ) / 0.0041667 \n\nCalculate (1 + 0.0041667)^12. Let me approximate that. Since 0.0041667 is 1/240, but maybe easier to compute. Alternatively, (1.0041667)^12. Let me see:\n\nApproximate using the formula (1 + r)^n \u2248 e^(n r) when r is small. But maybe better to calculate step by step.\n\nAlternatively, since 0.0041667 is 0.416667% per month. Let me compute (1.0041667)^12:\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\nFirst, (1.0041667)^12. Let me note that 1.0041667 is 1 + 0.05/12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to check if the present value comes to 360. \n\nLet me compute the denominator part:\n\nFirst, compute (1 - (1 + r)^-12)/r \n\nLet me plug in r = 0.0041667 (monthly rate):\n\nFirst compute (1 + r)^12 = (1.0041667)^12. Let me calculate this:\n\nLet me use logarithms. Let me take natural log of (1.0041667)^12 is 12 * ln(1.0041667). \n\nln(1.0041667) \u2248 0.004158 (since ln(1+x) \u2248x -x\u00b2/2, so for small x, it's approx 0.0041667 - (0.0041667)^2/2 \u22480.0041667 - ~0.00000868 \u22480.004158). \n\nSo 12 * 0.004158 \u22480.05. So exp(0.05) \u22481.05127. So (1.0041667)^12 \u22481.05127. \n\nSo (1/(1.05127)) \u22480.9511. \n\nSo 1 - 0.9511 = 0.0489. \n\nThen divide by r (0.0041667):\n\n0.0489 /0.0041667 \u224811.73. \n\nMultiply by PMT 31.50: 11.73 *31.50 \u2248 11.73*30=351.9 plus 11.73*1.5=17.595, total 369.5. Hmm, that's higher than 360. \n\nHmm, so if the monthly rate is 0.41667% (5% annual), then the present value would be approximately 369.5, which is more than 360. So that suggests that the actual rate is higher than 5%? Wait, that can't be. Because if the present value is higher than the loan amount, that would mean that the actual interest rate is lower than 5%. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The present value formula gives PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1+r)^-n ) / r ]\n\nIf the calculated PV with r=0.0041667 is 369.5, but the actual PV is 360, which is less. So that implies that the actual r must be higher than 0.0041667, because a higher r would decrease the PV. \n\nWait, let me see: when r increases, the denominator term (1 - (1+r)^-n)/r decreases, so the PV decreases. So to get a lower PV (360 instead of 369.5), we need a higher r. \n\nHmm, so the actual monthly rate is higher than 0.41667%, so the annual rate would be higher than 5%. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the answer isn't D then. But the options include 5%, which was the simple interest answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting simple interest. Let me see the total interest is 18, so 18/360=5% per annum. That's the simple interest approach. \n\nBut in reality, when paying monthly, the interest is calculated on a reducing balance, so the actual interest rate would be lower? Or higher?\n\nWait, in the simple interest case, the interest is calculated on the principal for the whole year. So total interest is 5% of 360 = 18, which matches. But in the case of monthly payments with reducing balance, the interest would be less, because each month you pay down the principal. \n\nWait, but in the problem, the total interest is still 18. Let me see. Let's try to compute the interest using monthly payments with a reducing balance. \n\nSuppose the rate is monthly, say 'r'. \n\nThe loan is 360. Each month, the payment is 31.50. \n\nThe first month's interest would be 360 * r. The principal paid is 31.50 - 360*r. \n\nSecond month's principal is 360 - (31.50 - 360r) = 360*(1 + r) - 31.50. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to set up the equation for the present value of the payments. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the simple interest approach. Since in that case, the answer is 5%, which is an option, and the calculation is straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using simple interest per annum, so the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the total interest over the year divided by principal, which gives 5%, so that's the nominal rate. \n\nGiven that the options include 5%, and the simple interest calculation gives that, and the problem might be expecting that approach, perhaps that's the right answer. \n\nAlternatively, let me check with another method. Let me think of the total amount paid as 12 *31.50= 378. The interest is 18. \n\nThe simple interest rate would be (Interest / Principal) *100 = (18/360)*100 =5%. \n\nTherefore, the answer is D. \n\nBut the other approach where using present value gives a different result. But maybe the question is not considering compound interest. Since the problem says \"interest rate\", without specifying, perhaps the simple interest is expected here. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D)5%.\n\n\nTo determine the interest rate, first calculate the total amount repaid:  \nTotal repayment = 12 \u00d7 \u20b931.50 = \u20b9378.  \n\nThe principal is \u20b9360, so the total interest paid is:  \nInterest = \u20b9378 \u2212 \u20b9360 = \u20b918.  \n\nUsing the simple interest formula \\( I = P \\times R \\times T \\), where \\( I = 18 \\), \\( P = 360 \\), and \\( T = 1 \\) year:  \n\\( 18 = 360 \\times R \\times 1 \\).  \n\nSolving for \\( R \\):  \n\\( R = \\frac{18}{360} = 0.05 \\), which is 5%.  \n\nWhile a more complex calculation considering monthly compounding would yield a different result, the question likely expects the simple interest approach, as it is straightforward and aligns with the provided options.  \n\nAnswer: D",
