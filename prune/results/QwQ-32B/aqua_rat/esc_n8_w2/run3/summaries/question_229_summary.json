      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. We need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true. \n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors of a number relates to its prime factorization. Specifically, if a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to their respective exponents, like Q = p\u2081^a \u00d7 p\u2082^b \u00d7 ... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. So, for example, if a number is a square of a prime, like p\u00b2, then its factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, so that's 3 factors. Wait, but the question says 5 factors. Hmm.\n\nWait, 5 is a prime number, so the total number of factors must be a product of integers greater than 1 that multiply to 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way is 5 \u00d7 1. That means the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because then the exponents plus one would be (4+1)=5. Alternatively, maybe there's another way? Like if there are two primes, but then (a+1)(b+1) would have to equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only factors are 5 and 1. So that would require one exponent to be 4 and the other exponent part to be 0, which isn't possible because primes can't have exponent 0 here. So the only way is a single prime raised to the 4th power. Wait, but wait, wait a second. Wait, let me think again. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nSo the formula for the number of divisors is correct. Suppose Q's prime factorization is p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1). Since 5 is prime, the only way to get 5 as a product is (5)*(1). So that means that one of the exponents plus one must be 5, and the others (if any) must contribute 1. So that implies that there can be only one prime factor. Because any other prime would add a term like (b+1) which would have to be 1, so b=0, which means that prime isn't actually part of the factorization. So the only possibility is that Q is p^4 where p is prime. \n\nWait, but then let me check with an example. Let's take p=2. Then 2^4 is 16. What are the factors of 16? 1,2,4,8,16. That's five factors. Yep, that works. Another example, 3^4 is 81. Its factors are 1,3,9,27,81. Five factors. So that's correct. So Q must be the fourth power of a prime. \n\nNow let's look at the options. The statements are:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number.\n\nWait, if Q is p^4, then that can be written as (p\u00b2) squared. Wait, no, p^4 is (p squared) squared, so that's a square. So p^4 is the square of p squared, which is a prime squared? Wait, no. Wait, p is a prime, so p squared is not a prime. Wait, so Q = p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, but the square of a composite number. Hmm. So statement I says \"the square of a prime number\". So that would be like if Q was (prime)^2. Like, for example, if Q was p\u00b2, then it would have 3 factors. But in our case, Q has 5 factors, so that's when it's p^4. So in that case, is Q the square of a prime? No, because p^4 is (p squared)^2, but p squared is not a prime. So then statement I would not be true. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me think again. Let me see: Suppose Q is p^4, then Q is the square of p squared, but p squared is composite (since p is prime, p squared is composite unless p is 2, but even then 2 squared is 4 which is composite). So the square of a prime number would be (prime)^2, which would have three factors. So Q here is p^4, which is not the square of a prime, but the square of a composite (if p is prime, then p squared is composite). Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, but wait the options are which must be true. Wait, but maybe there's a different way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me check again. Wait, the problem states that Q has 5 factors. So the only way is that it's a prime raised to the 4th power. So in that case, is there another possibility where Q could be the product of two primes? Let me think: suppose Q is the product of two distinct primes, say p and q. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1) =4, which is less than 5. If it's the product of the same prime twice (so p squared), then it's 3 factors. If it's a product of three primes, like p*q*r, then factors would be 8? Wait, no, (1+1)^3=8, but that's if three distinct primes each to the first power. But that's 8 factors, which is more than 5. So no. So the only way to get 5 factors is indeed p^4. \n\nSo then, the options are:\n\nStatement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, but that's the square of a composite (since p is prime, so p squared is composite unless p is 2, but even then 2 squared is 4). So the square of a prime would be p squared, which would have 3 factors, but Q has 5. So I is not true. So statement I is not necessarily true. Wait but the question says \"must be true\". Since Q must be p^4, then it's not the square of a prime, so I is false. \n\nStatement II says Q is the fourth power of a prime. That's exactly what we just concluded. So II must be true. \n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. Well, the product of two primes (like p*q) would give 4 factors. So that's not 5. If it's the product of two primes where one is squared, like p^3 * q^1? Wait no, then factors would be (3+1)(1+1)=8. Not 5. So the product of two primes in any way can't give 5 factors. Therefore III is not true. \n\nSo the correct statements are only II. So looking at the options, the answer would be C) II only. Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)I only\n\nB)III only\n\nC)II only\n\nD)I and II only\n\nE)I and III only\n\nHmm, so according to my analysis, only II is correct. So the answer is C. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check if there's another scenario where Q can have five factors but not be a fourth power of a prime. \n\nSuppose there's a case where the exponent plus 1 is 5, but with multiple primes? Wait, no. The number of factors is the product of each exponent plus 1. So if there are two primes, then the total factors would be (a+1)(b+1). To get 5, which is prime, one of them has to be 5 and the other 1. But then one exponent would be 4 (since 4+1=5) and the other exponent would be 0 (since 0+1=1). But exponent 0 would mean that prime isn't actually present. So it's only one prime. So the only possibility is p^4. \n\nTherefore, the statements:\n\nI: Not true. Because Q is p^4, which is the square of p squared (a composite), not a prime squared. \n\nII: True. \n\nIII: Not true. \n\nSo the correct answer is C, option C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true. The options are given, so I'll have to evaluate each statement one by one. \n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors of a number relates to its prime factorization. The formula is that if a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p\u2081^a \u00d7 p\u2082^b \u00d7 ... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. So for example, if a number is p^4, then the number of factors would be 4+1=5. Wait, that's exactly 5 factors. \n\nHmm, so if Q has exactly 5 factors, then its prime factorization must be such that when you apply that formula, you get 5. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to write it as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. That means the exponents in the prime factors plus one must multiply to 5. So the exponents plus one can only be 5, which implies that there's only one prime factor, and its exponent is 4. Because (4+1)=5. \n\nWait, but another possibility? Let me think again. Suppose the number is a square of a prime. Let's say Q = p\u00b2. Then the number of factors would be 2+1 =3. Not 5. So that's different. So if the exponent is 4, then the number of factors is 5. So Q must be of the form p\u2074 where p is a prime. \n\nSo then, let's look at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. \n\nHmm, if Q is p\u2074, then that's (p\u00b2) squared. Wait, but p\u2074 is the square of p squared. So technically, it is the square of a prime squared. But wait, the square of a prime number would be p\u00b2, but p\u2074 is (p\u00b2)^2, but p squared is not a prime unless p is 2, but that's not the case here. Wait, no. Wait, the square of a prime number would be like (prime)^2, but here, the square is of p squared, which is not a prime. So maybe statement I is not correct. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the original statement I says \"Q is the square of a prime number.\" So if Q is p^4, then that can be written as (p\u00b2)\u00b2. But p\u00b2 is not a prime unless p is... Wait, primes are numbers like 2,3,5 etc. p squared would be 4,9,25, which are not primes. So unless p\u00b2 is a prime, but that can't happen because primes are only divisible by 1 and themselves. So the square of a prime number would be (prime)^2, but that would have factors 1, prime, and prime squared, so three factors, not five. Therefore, Q being p^4 is not the square of a prime number. So statement I is not true. Wait, so maybe I was wrong here. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my initial reasoning. Let me re-examine. \n\nWait, the number of factors is (exponent +1). So if a number has exactly five factors, since 5 is prime, the only way is that it's of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because 4+1=5. \n\nTherefore, Q must be a fourth power of a prime. So that's statement II. So statement II would be true. Wait, but the options include that. Let's check the statements again. \n\nStatement II says \"Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\" So that's exactly what we just said. So II must be true. \n\nWait, but what about statement I? The square of a prime number would be p squared. Which has three factors. So if Q had three factors, then it would be the square of a prime. But here, Q has five factors, so that's different. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true. \n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two prime numbers. Well, if Q is p^4, then its prime factors are only p. So the product of two primes would be like p*q where p and q are primes, but then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, so four factors. But Q has five factors, so that can't be. So III is not correct. \n\nWait, but could there be another case where Q has five factors but is a product of two primes? Let's see. Suppose Q is p*q where p and q are different primes. Then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. Not 5. If they are the same prime, like p*p, then it's p squared, which has 3 factors. So no. So the only way to get 5 factors is if it's a single prime raised to the 4th power. \n\nTherefore, the correct statements would be II only. So looking at the options, C is the answer. Wait, but let me check again. \n\nWait, the options are: \n\nA)I only\n\nB)III only\n\nC)II only\n\nD)I and II only\n\nE)I and III only\n\nSo according to my analysis, II is correct, so answer C. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe there's another scenario where the number of factors is 5. For instance, if the prime factorization has exponents such that (a+1)(b+1) =5. But since 5 is prime, the only factors are 1 and 5. So the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1, but that would mean there's only one prime factor with exponent 4, and no other primes. So that's the only way. \n\nSo the number must be p^4. So statement II is correct. \n\nSo then, why is the first option I not correct? Because statement I says it's the square of a prime. Wait, p^4 is (p squared)^2, so technically, it is the square of p squared. But p squared is not a prime. So the square of a prime number would require that the base is a prime. Since p squared isn't a prime, that's not the case. Therefore, I is not true. \n\nTherefore, only statement II must be true. So the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me think of an example. Let's take a prime number, say 2. Then 2^4 is 16. What are the factors of 16? 1,2,4,8,16. That's five factors. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAnother example: 3^4 is 81. Factors are 1,3,9,27,81. Five factors. \n\nSo in all cases, the number must be a fourth power of a prime. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C) II only. \n\nBut let me check the other options again. \n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. But if Q is p^4, then it's not a product of two different primes. So that's false. \n\nSo yes, the correct answer is C. So the options given have C as the answer.\n",

So Q must be of the form p\u2074 where p is a prime. \n\nSo then, let's look at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. \n\nHmm, if Q is p\u2074, then that's (p\u00b2) squared. Wait, but p\u2074 is the square of p squared. So technically, it is the square of a prime squared. But wait, the square of a prime number would be p\u00b2, but p\u2074 is (p\u00b2)^2, but p squared is not a prime unless p is 2, but that's not the case here. Wait, no. Wait, the square of a prime number would be like (prime)^2, but here, the square is of p squared, which is not a prime. So maybe statement I is not correct. Wait, this is confusing. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the original statement I says \"Q is the square of a prime number.\" So if Q is p^4, then that can be written as (p\u00b2)\u00b2. But p\u00b2 is not a prime unless p is... Wait, primes are numbers like 2,3,5 etc. p squared would be 4,9,25, which are not primes. So unless p\u00b2 is a prime, but that can't happen because primes are only divisible by 1 and themselves. So the square of a prime number would be (prime)^2, but that would have factors 1, prime, and prime squared, so three factors, not five. Therefore, Q being p^4 is not the square of a prime number. So statement I is not true. Wait, so maybe I was wrong here. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my initial reasoning. Let me re-examine. \n\nWait, the number of factors is (exponent +1). So if a number has exactly five factors, since 5 is prime, the only way is that it's of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because 4+1=5. \n\nTherefore, Q must be a fourth power of a prime. So that's statement II. So statement II would be true. Wait, but the options include that. Let's check the statements again. \n\nStatement II says \"Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\" So that's exactly what we just said. So II must be true. \n\nWait, but what about statement I? The square of a prime number would be p squared. Which has three factors. So if Q had three factors, then it would be the square of a prime. But here, Q has five factors, so that's different. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true. \n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two prime numbers. Well, if Q is p^4, then its prime factors are only p. So the product of two primes would be like p*q where p and q are primes, but then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, so four factors. But Q has five factors, so that can't be. So III is not correct. \n\nWait, but could there be another case where Q has five factors but is a product of two primes? Let's see. Suppose Q is p*q where p and q are different primes. Then the number of factors is (1+1)(1+1)=4. Not 5. If they are the same prime, like p*p, then it's p squared, which has 3 factors. So no. So the only way to get 5 factors is if it's a single prime raised to the 4th power. \n\nTherefore, the correct statements would be II only. So looking at the options, C is the answer. Wait, but let me check again. \n\nWait, the options are: \n\nA)I only\n\nB)III only\n\nC)II only\n\nD)I and II only\n\nE)I and III only\n\nSo according to my analysis, II is correct, so answer C. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe there's another scenario where the number of factors is 5. For instance, if the prime factorization has exponents such that (a+1)(b+1) =5. But since 5 is prime, the only factors are 1 and 5. So the exponents plus one must be 5 and 1, but that would mean there's only one prime factor with exponent 4, and no other primes. So that's the only way. \n\nSo the number must be p^4. So statement II is correct. \n\nSo then, why is the first option I not correct? Because statement I says it's the square of a prime. Wait, p^4 is (p squared)^2, so technically, it is the square of p squared. But p squared is not a prime. So the square of a prime number would require that the base is a prime. Since p squared isn't a prime, that's not the case. Therefore, I is not true. \n\nTherefore, only statement II must be true. So the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but wait another thought. Let me think of an example. Let's take a prime number, say 2. Then 2^4 is 16. What are the factors of 16? 1,2,4,8,16. That's five factors. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAnother example: 3^4 is 81. Factors are 1,3,9,27,81. Five factors. \n\nSo in all cases, the number must be a fourth power of a prime. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C) II only. \n\nBut let me check the other options again. \n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. But if Q is p^4, then it's not a product of two different primes. So that's false. \n\nSo yes, the correct answer is C. So the options given have C as the answer.\n\n\nTo determine which statements must be true about Q, a positive integer with exactly 5 factors, we analyze the number of factors formula. A number Q with prime factorization \\( Q = p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\times \\dots \\) has \\( (a+1)(b+1)\\dots \\) factors. Since 5 is prime, the only factorization is \\( 5 = 5 \\times 1 \\), implying Q must be of the form \\( p^4 \\) (where \\( p \\) is prime), as \\( (4+1) = 5 \\).\n\n**Statement I**: Q is the square of a prime number.  \n- \\( p^4 \\) can be written as \\( (p^2)^2 \\), but \\( p^2 \\) is not a prime (unless \\( p = 1 \\), which is not prime). Thus, Q is not the square of a prime number. **I is false**.\n\n**Statement II**: Q is the fourth power of a prime number.  \n- Since Q must be \\( p^4 \\), this is directly true. **II is true**.\n\n**Statement III**: Q is the product of two prime numbers.  \n- A product of two distinct primes \\( p \\times q \\) has \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\) factors, which contradicts the requirement of 5 factors. **III is false**.\n\nThus, only **Statement II** must be true. The correct answer is **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
