      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about finding the cost price of an article that a trader sold at a 20% profit for Rs. 360. Hmm, let's think. I remember that when something is sold at a profit, the selling price is the cost price plus a percentage of the cost price. \n\nRight, the formula should be Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit Percentage \u00d7 Cost Price). Or maybe written as SP = CP \u00d7 (1 + profit%). Since the profit here is 20%, that would make the SP equal to 120% of the CP. \n\nSo the given selling price is Rs. 360, which is 120% of the original cost. To find the original cost (CP), I need to reverse that. Let me set up the equation. Let's let CP be x. Then 120% of x is 360. \n\nConverting percentage to decimal, 120% is 1.2. So 1.2 \u00d7 x = 360. To solve for x, divide both sides by 1.2. \n\nCalculating that: 360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 1.2 times 300 is 360 because 1.2 \u00d7 300 = 360. Wait, so does that mean the cost price is 300? Let me check again. \n\nIf the cost was 300 and he made 20% profit, then 20% of 300 is 60. Adding that to 300 gives 360. Yep, that matches the selling price given. So the answer should be B) 300. Let me look at the options again. Option B is 300. So that's the one. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do 360 divided by 1.2 step by step. 1.2 times 300: 1.2*300 = 360. Correct. Alternatively, 360 divided by 1.2: 360 divided by 1.2 is the same as 3600 divided by 12, which is 300. Yeah, that checks out. So definitely B is the right answer. The other options don't fit. For example, if someone thought 20% of 360 is the profit, that's wrong because the 20% is on cost, not selling price. So yeah, B is correct.\n",

Hmm, let me think through this step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that when something is sold at a profit, the selling price is the cost price plus a percentage of the cost price as profit. The formula I think is Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit Percentage \u00d7 Cost Price). Alternatively, that can be written as Selling Price = Cost Price \u00d7 (1 + Profit Percentage in decimal). \n\nRight, so the profit here is 20%, which as a decimal is 0.2. The selling price is given as Rs.360. Let me denote the cost price as CP. Then according to the formula:\n\nSelling Price = CP \u00d7 (1 + 0.20)  \nSo, 360 = CP \u00d7 1.2 \n\nTo find CP, I need to divide 360 by 1.2. Let me calculate that. \n\nWait, 360 divided by 1.2.

Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, if 20% profit on CP gives 360, then CP plus 20% of CP equals 360. So CP*(1 + 20/100) = 360. Yeah, same equation. \n\nSo solving for CP: CP = 360 / 1.2. Let me compute that. 360 divided by 1.2. Let me do the division step by step. \n\nWell, 1.2 times 300 is 360. Because 1.2 times 100 is 120, so times 300 would be 360. Exactly.
