      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about an airplane flying around a square, and I need to find the average speed. Hmm, average speed can sometimes be tricky because it's not just the average of the speeds. I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. Right, so I can't just take the arithmetic mean of 200, 400, 600, and 800. I need to think about how much time was spent on each side.\n\nThe square has four sides of equal length, right? Let me denote the length of each side as 's' kilometers. So the total distance the plane travels is 4 times s, so 4s km. \n\nNow, to find the average speed, I need the total time taken for the journey. The time for each side would be distance divided by speed. So for each side:\n\nFirst side: time1 = s / 200\nSecond side: time2 = s / 400\nThird side: time3 = s / 600\nFourth side: time4 = s / 800\n\nTotal time is the sum of these four times. So total time T = (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800). \n\nThen the average speed V_avg = total distance / total time = 4s / T. \n\nLet me compute T first. Let's factor out the s:\n\nT = s*(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800). \n\nI need to add those fractions. To add them, I should find a common denominator. Let's see, denominators are 200,400,600,800. What's the least common multiple here? \n\nWell, breaking them into prime factors:\n\n200 = 2^3 * 5^2\n\n400 = 2^4 *5^2\n\n600 = 2^3 *3 *5^2\n\n800 = 2^5 *5^2\n\nSo the LCM would take the highest exponents: 2^5, 3^1, 5^2. So that's 32 *3 *25 = 32*75= 2400. \n\nSo common denominator is 2400. Let me convert each fraction:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400 (since 200*12=2400)\n\n1/400 = 6/2400 (400*6=2400)\n\n1/600 = 4/2400 (600*4=2400)\n\n1/800 = 3/2400 (800*3=2400)\n\nAdding them up: 12 +6 +4 +3 = 25. So the sum is 25/2400.\n\nSo T = s*(25/2400) = (25s)/2400.\n\nWait, let me check that again. The sum of the fractions is 25/2400, so yes. \n\nSo then total time T is (25s)/2400. \n\nThen average speed V_avg = 4s divided by (25s/2400). \n\nThe s terms will cancel out. So:\n\nV_avg = 4 / (25/(2400)) ) = 4 * (2400/25) \n\nLet me compute that. \n\n2400 divided by 25 is 96 (since 25*96=2400). Wait, no, 25*96 is 2400? Let me check: 25*100 is 2500, so subtract 25*4=100, so 2500-100=2400. Yes. So 2400/25 = 96. \n\nSo 4 multiplied by 96 is 384. \n\nHmm, so the average speed would be 384 km/h. Looking at the options, that's option A. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in adding the fractions. Let me recheck the addition of the numerators:\n\n12 (from 1/200) +6 (1/400) is 18, plus 4 (1/600) gives 22, plus 3 (1/800) gives 25. Yep, that's correct. \n\nSo the calculation seems right. So the answer must be A) 384. Let me check the options again. The options are A)384, B)562, C)458, D)156, E)452. So A is the first option. \n\nI think that's correct. The key was to use harmonic mean appropriately here since the distances are equal for each segment. Since each side is the same distance, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the speeds, weighted by the distance. Wait, actually, when the distances are equal, the formula is total distance divided by total time, which in this case, since each segment is same distance, it's the harmonic mean of the four speeds, but adjusted properly. \n\nAlternatively, the formula for average speed when equal distances are covered is (4)/(1/v1 +1/v2 +1/v3 +1/v4) but wait no, wait the harmonic mean for n terms would be n divided by the sum of reciprocals. Wait, let me see. \n\nSuppose each of the four sides is distance s, so total distance is 4s. The total time is s(1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800). So the average speed is 4s divided by that time, which is 4/(sum of 1/speed terms). Which is exactly what I did. So yes, the calculation is correct. So the answer is A.\n",

The speeds along the four sides are given as 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/h. Hmm, average speed can be tricky because I remember it's not just the average of the speeds. Wait, right, average speed is total distance divided by total time. Oh right, that's the key.\n\nThe question mentions a square, so all four sides are the same length. Let me denote each side's distance as 'd' kilometers. Since it's a square, each side is equal. So the total distance the plane flies is 4d.\n\nNow, to find the average speed, I need total distance divided by total time. The total time will be the sum of the time taken for each side. Time is distance divided by speed for each segment. \n\nLet me write this out. For each side, the time taken would be d divided by the speed of that side. So, the first side at 200 km/h takes d/200 hours. The second at 400 would be d/400, third d/600, and the fourth d/800. Adding all these times together gives the total time.\n\nSo total time T = (d/200) + (d/400) + (d/600) + (d/800). \n\nThen, average speed V_avg = total distance / total time = 4d / T.\n\nSince d is common in all terms, maybe it will cancel out. Let's see. Let me compute the denominator first. Let me factor out d from each term in T:\n\nT = d*(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800). \n\nSo the average speed becomes 4d divided by [d*(sum of reciprocals)]. The d's cancel, so V_avg = 4 / (sum of reciprocals).\n\nNow, I need to compute the sum of the reciprocals: 1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800. Let me find a common denominator here. Let's see, denominators are 200,400,600,800. The least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Hmm, maybe 2400? Let me check. \n\n200 factors into 2^3*5^2, 400 is 2^4*5^2, 600 is 2^3*3*5^2, 800 is 2^5*5^2. So LCM would be the highest exponents: 2^5, 3^1, 5^2. So 32*3*25 = 32*75 = 2400. Yes, that's the LCM. So converting each fraction to 2400 denominator.\n\n1/200 = 12/2400 (since 2400/200 =12)\n1/400 = 6/2400 (2400/400=6)\n1/600 = 4/2400 (2400/600=4)\n1/800 = 3/2400 (2400/800=3)\n\nAdding these up: 12 +6 +4 +3 = 25. So total sum is 25/2400. \n\nSo the denominator in the average speed formula is 25/2400. \n\nTherefore, V_avg = 4 divided by (25/2400) = 4 * (2400/25) \n\nCalculating that: 2400 divided by 25 is 96. Because 25*96 = 2400. \n\nSo 4 * 96 = 384. \n\nWait, so the average speed is 384 km/h. Looking at the options, option A is 384. That should be the answer. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.\n\nFirst, total distance is 4d. The time for each side was calculated correctly. The sum of reciprocals: 1/200 +1/400+1/600+1/800. Converted to 2400, that's 12+6+4+3=25 parts. So yes, 25/2400. Then 4 divided by that fraction is indeed 4*(2400/25) = (4*2400)/25. Let me compute 2400 divided by 25 again: 25 times 96 is 2400. So 4*96 is 384. Yep, that's correct. So the answer must be A)384.\n",
