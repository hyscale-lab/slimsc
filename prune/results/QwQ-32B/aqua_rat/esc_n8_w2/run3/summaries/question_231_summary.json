      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the minimum number of DVDs someone has to rent each month to make the membership worth it. Let's see. The problem says that without a membership, each DVD is $4.00. But if you get the membership for $7 a month, each rental is $2.00. \n\nHmm, so the question is, at what number of rentals does the total cost with the membership become less than without it? That's the break-even point, right?\n\nLet me set up equations for both scenarios. Let's call the number of DVDs rented \"x\".\n\nWithout membership: Total cost is 4 times x, so 4x.\n\nWith membership: It's the $7 membership fee plus 2 per DVD, so 7 + 2x.\n\nWe want to find the smallest x where the membership cost is less than the non-membership. So, set up the inequality:\n\n7 + 2x < 4x\n\nSubtract 2x from both sides: 7 < 2x\n\nThen divide both sides by 2: 3.5 < x\n\nSo x has to be greater than 3.5. Since you can't rent half a DVD, you have to round up to the next whole number. That would be 4. Wait, but let me check the options. The options are up to 5. Let me verify again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me redo the math step by step. \n\nOriginal inequality: 7 + 2x < 4x.\n\nSubtract 2x from both sides gives 7 < 2x. \n\nDivide by 2: 3.5 < x. So x must be more than 3.5. Since you can't rent 3.5, the next integer is 4. So the minimum is 4? But let me check the options. The options are D)4 and E)5. Wait, but maybe I should check the total costs for 3 and 4 to see exactly where it crosses over.\n\nLet's test x=3. \n\nWithout membership: 3 *4= $12. With membership: 7 + (3*2)= 7+6=13. So 13 is more than 12, so not better yet. \n\nAt x=4: Without is 16, with membership is 7 +8=15. 15 <16, so that's better. So 4 is the minimum. So the answer should be D)4?\n\nWait, but the options given include D as 4. So that would be correct. Let me check again. The question asks for the minimum number where it's worth buying the membership. So when you rent 4, the total cost with membership is cheaper. So yeah, 4 is the answer. So option D. \n\nWait, but let me check if I considered the problem correctly. The membership is a monthly fee. So the question is per month, right? So assuming that the person is planning to rent the DVDs in that same month when they buy the membership. So the $7 is a one-time monthly fee, and the question is, how many rentals in a month would make it worth it. So yes, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the membership is a one-time fee? Wait, the problem says \"purchase a membership for $7.00 per month\". Oh, per month. So each month you pay $7, and then the per rental is $2. So the analysis is correct. So the answer is D)4.\n",

The question is asking for the minimum number of DVDs I need to rent in a month so that the total cost with the membership is less than without it.\n\nHmm, right. So I guess I need to set up an equation here. Let me think. Let's say the number of DVDs is x. \n\nWithout membership, the cost would be straightforward: 4 times x.

So I need to find when 7 + 2x is less than 4x.\n\nLet me write that down as an inequality:\n\n7 + 2x < 4x\n\nHmm, solving for x. Subtract 2x from both sides:\n\n7 < 2x\n\nThen divide both sides by 2:\n\n7/2 < x\n\nWhich is 3.5 < x.
