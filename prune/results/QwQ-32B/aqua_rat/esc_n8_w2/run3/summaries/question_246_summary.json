      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this probability problem here. The question is about finding the probability that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election. The chance that a single voter voted is 90%, so the probability of voting is 0.9, and not voting is 0.1, I guess.\n\nHmm, right, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. Because each voter is an independent trial with two outcomes: voted or didn't vote. The formula for exactly k successes in n trials is given by the binomial formula: P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). \n\nSo in this case, n is 5 voters, and we want exactly k=4 who voted. Let me plug those numbers in. \n\nFirst, calculate the combination part, which is \"5 choose 4\". That's 5, because there are 5 ways to choose which 4 out of the 5 voters are the ones who voted. \n\nThen, multiply that by (0.9)^4 for the four voters who did vote. Then multiply by (0.1)^1 for the one who didn't. \n\nLet me do the math step by step. \n\nCalculating (0.9)^4. Let's see, 0.9 squared is 0.81. Then squared again, so 0.81 * 0.81 = 0.6561. Wait, no, that's 0.9^4? Wait, 0.9^3 is 0.729, so 0.9^4 is 0.729 * 0.9 = 0.6561. Right. \n\nThen (0.1)^1 is just 0.1. \n\nSo multiplying all together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. \n\nLet me compute that. 0.6561 * 0.1 is 0.06561. Then multiply by 5: 0.06561 *5. \n\nHmm, 0.06561 times 5. Let's see: 0.06*5 is 0.3, 0.00561 *5 is 0.02805. Adding those gives 0.32805. So that's 32.805%. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 32.8%, so that must be the answer. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might mix up exponents or combinations. \n\nWait, combination: 5 choose 4 is indeed 5. Correct. The exponents for p (0.9) are 4, and (1-p) is 0.1, raised to 1. So yes, the formula is correct. The multiplication steps also check out. 0.9^4 is 0.6561, multiplied by 0.1 gives 0.06561, times 5 is 0.32805, which is 32.8%. So the answer should be B. \n\nHmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate (0.9)^4 again. \n\n0.9 *0.9 =0.81. Then 0.81 *0.9 = 0.729, then 0.729*0.9= 0.6561. Yes. So that's right. \n\nThen 0.6561 * 0.1 is 0.06561. Multiply by 5 gives 0.32805. Exactly. So 32.8%, which is option B. The options given include B as 32.8%, so that's correct. I think that's the right answer.\n",

Hmm, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. \n\nRight, binomial because each trial (voter) has two outcomes: voted or didn't vote.
