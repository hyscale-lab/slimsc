      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find out what 60% of 30% of 1400 grams is. Hmm, let's see. Alright, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this step by step.\n\nFirst, the question is asking for 30% of 1400 grams first, right? Then take 60% of that result. Or maybe I can do it all in one go? Let me think. Oh right, percentages can be multiplied together. Like, 60% of 30% is the same as 0.6 times 0.3, which would give the combined percentage. Then multiply that by 1400. Let me try both ways to make sure.\n\nStarting with the first method: find 30% of 1400. So 30% is 0.3 in decimal. 1400 multiplied by 0.3. Let me calculate that. 1400 times 0.3. Well, 1400 times 0.1 is 140, so 0.3 is three times that, which is 420. So 30% of 1400 is 420 grams. Then, take 60% of that 420. 60% is 0.6. So 420 multiplied by 0.6. Let's do that. 400 times 0.6 is 240, and 20 times 0.6 is 12. Adding those together gives 240 +12 = 252. So that would be 252 grams. Hmm, option C is 252 gms. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do it all in one step. 60% of 30% of 1400. So that's 0.6 * 0.3 * 1400. 0.6 times 0.3 is 0.18. Then 0.18 multiplied by 1400. Let me calculate that. 0.1 times 1400 is 140, and 0.08 times 1400 is 112. Adding those together: 140 + 112 = 252. Same result. So that's 252 grams. Looking at the options, option C is 252. So that's the answer?\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)450, B)100, C)252, D)240, E)None. So C is there, so the answer should be C. But hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.\n\nFirst step: 30% of 1400. 0.3 *1400. 1400 divided by 10 is 140, times 3 is 420. Correct. Then 60% of 420. 0.6 *420. Let me break that down again. 400*0.6 is 240, 20*0.6 is 12. 240+12 is 252. So that's right. Alternatively, 420 divided by 10 is 42, times 6 gives 252. Yep. So that's correct. So option C is correct. So why is there an option D as 240? Maybe a common mistake if someone miscalculates. But according to my calculations, it's 252. So the answer should be C. Hmm. Wait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says 60% of 30% of 1400 grams. So yes, that's exactly what I did. So the answer is C. So the correct option is C)252 gms. Therefore, the answer must be C.\n",

Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find 30% of 1400 grams. To do that, I remember that percentages are fractions out of 100. So 30% is the same as 0.30 in decimal form. So multiplying 1400 by 0.30 should give me that part. Let me calculate that: 1400 * 0.3. Let's see, 1400 times 0.3 is like 1400 * 3 divided by 10, right? 1400*3 is 4200, divided by 10 gives 420. So 30% of 1400 is 420 grams.\n\nNow, the next part is 60% of that result. So take 60% of 420 grams. Again, converting 60% to decimal is 0.60. So multiply 420 by 0.6. Let's do that. 420 * 0.6. Breaking it down, 400 *0.6 is 240, and 20 *0.6 is 12.

Alternatively, 420 divided by 10 is 42, times 6 would be 252. Yes that's right. So the answer should be C)252. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach it. Like combining the percentages first. Since it's 60% of 30%, that's the same as multiplying 0.6 *0.3 =0.18. So 18% of 1400. Let's see what that gives. 1400 *0.18. Hmm, 10% is 140, so 20% is 280, subtract 2% which is 28, so 280 -28=252. Yep, same answer. So that confirms it. The correct answer should be C. Let me check the options again. Option C is 252, so that's the right choice. I don't see any errors here. So the answer is C.\n",
