      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where n is between 36 and 72, and then figure out which interval x falls into. The expression for x is given as (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify the numerator and denominator first.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator. Let me see. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Hmm, the denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let me see if those are perfect squares or something.\n\nLet me think. The denominator: n +4\u221an +4. Let me substitute \u221an as a variable. Let\u2019s say let\u2019s let t = \u221an. Then n is t\u00b2. So substituting, the denominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4. Oh! That's a perfect square! Because t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t +2)^2. So denominator is (\u221an +2)^2. \n\nWhat about the numerator? The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me also express that in terms of t. Since n is t\u00b2, then:\n\nNumerator becomes (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term is t^4. The second term is 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 +8t. The third term is 16. So adding all together:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, maybe this can be factored as well? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is also a perfect square. Let me check. Let me think of the numerator as something squared. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the numerator is (t^2 + a t + b)^2? Let's see:\n\nExpanding (t\u00b2 + a t + b)^2 would give t^4 + 2a t^3 + (a\u00b2 + 2b) t^2 + 2ab t + b\u00b2. Comparing coefficients with numerator's terms (t^4 +2t^3 +0 t^2 +8t +16). \n\nHmm, so coefficients:\n\nThe t^4 term matches. For t^3: 2a must equal 2, so a=1.\n\nThen for the t^2 term: a\u00b2 + 2b must equal 0 (since there's no t\u00b2 term in numerator). Since a is 1, that gives 1 + 2b =0 \u2192 2b= -1 \u2192 b= -0.5. But then let's check the next terms.\n\nThe t term would be 2ab t: 2*(1)*(-0.5)= -1, but in the numerator it's +8t. So that doesn't match. So that approach might not work. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (t^2 + something)^2 plus or minus something? Let me try another approach. Maybe the numerator can be written as (t^2 + 2t + 4)^2? Let me compute that.\n\n(t^2 +2t +4)^2 = t^4 +4t^3 + (4t^2 + 16t) + 16? Wait, no, let me actually expand it properly:\n\n(t^2 + 2t +4)^2 = (t^2)^2 + (2t)^2 + (4)^2 + 2*(t^2*2t + t^2*4 + 2t*4)\n\nWait, no, better to expand step by step:\n\nFirst, (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. Here a = t\u00b2, b=2t, c=4.\n\nSo, (t\u00b2)^2 + (2t)^2 +4\u00b2 + 2*(t\u00b2*2t + t\u00b2*4 + 2t*4)\n\nWait, that's t^4 +4t\u00b2 +16 + 2*(2t^3 +4t\u00b2 +8t). Let me compute that:\n\n= t^4 +4t\u00b2 +16 +4t^3 +8t\u00b2 +16t \n\nCombine like terms: t^4 +4t^3 + (4t\u00b2 +8t\u00b2) = 12t\u00b2, plus 16t, plus 16. So that's t^4 +4t^3 +12t\u00b2 +16t +16. Not the same as the numerator which is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. So that's not matching. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me go back to the original numerator:\n\nOriginal numerator in terms of t is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Wait, perhaps grouping terms?\n\nLet me see, group t^4 + 2t^3 and 8t +16. \n\nFirst group: t^3(t +2). Second group: 8(t +2). So that would be (t^3 +8)(t+2). Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, t^4 +2t^3 = t^3(t +2), and 8t +16 =8(t +2). So then, factoring (t+2):\n\nt^3(t+2) +8(t+2) = (t+2)(t^3 +8). \n\nAh! Oh, that's a good step! So numerator becomes (t+2)(t^3 +8). Then, the denominator is (t+2)^2. So x = numerator/denominator = [ (t+2)(t^3 +8) ] / (t+2)^2 ) = (t^3 +8)/(t+2).\n\nSimplify that. Now, t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. Remember that a^3 +b^3 = (a +b)(a^2 -ab +b^2). So here, a = t, b=2, since 2^3 is 8. So:\n\nt^3 +8 = (t +2)(t^2 -2t +4). \n\nTherefore, substituting back into x:\n\nx = [ (t +2)(t^2 - 2t +4) ] / (t +2) ) \n\nCancel out (t+2) terms (since t = sqrt(n), which is positive and since n is between 36 and 72, t is between 6 and 8.485, so t+2 is not zero, so cancellation is okay). \n\nThus, x simplifies to t^2 -2t +4. \n\nBut wait, t is sqrt(n), so substituting back:\n\nx = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, t^2 is n. So t^2 -2t +4 is n - 2\u221an +4. So x = n - 2\u221an +4. \n\nHmm, that's a much simpler expression. So now, the problem reduces to finding the range of x when n is between 36 and 72. \n\nSo let's compute x for n=36 and n=72, and also check if it's increasing or decreasing in between to find the min and max. \n\nFirst, let's compute x at n=36:\n\nsqrt(36)=6. So x =36 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=72, sqrt(72)= approx 8.485. Let's compute exactly:\n\nsqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)\u22488.48528.\n\nSo x =72 -2*(8.48528) +4 \u224872 -16.97056 +4 \u224872+4 is 76, minus 16.97056 gives \u224859.02944. \n\nWait, so when n=72, x\u224859.03. \n\nWait, so when n increases from 36 to 72, what happens to x? Let's see the function x(n) = n -2\u221an +4. Let me see the derivative to check if it's increasing or decreasing. \n\nTaking derivative dx/dn = 1 - 2*(1/(2\u221an)) +0 = 1 - (1/\u221an). Since n \u226536, sqrt(n) is at least 6. So 1/sqrt(n) \u22641/6. So 1 - (1/sqrt(n)) is at least 1 -1/6=5/6>0. So derivative is always positive. So x is increasing in n. \n\nTherefore, the minimum x is at n=36 (28) and the maximum x is at n=72 (\u224859.03). \n\nSo the range of x is from 28 to approximately 59.03. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 but 54 is less than the upper limit here (59), so this is too low.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 the upper limit here is 58, which is still under 59.03, so the upper bound is too low.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 lower bound is okay, but upper is 64. Since x can go up to ~59, which is less than 64. So the upper bound here is higher than needed, but the lower bound is lower than the actual minimum (since minimum x is 28). So 25 is okay but the lower bound is okay, but the minimum is 28, so the interval starts below, but the actual x never goes below 28, so 25 <x would include that, but the options are about the ranges that x satisfies. The question says \"satisfies\" so the correct interval must fully contain all possible x values. Since the minimum is 28, any option that has lower bound less than 28 would still include the actual values. But the options are about which interval x is in. Wait the question says \"x satisfies\", so the correct option must be an interval that contains all possible x. Let me check each option again.\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64. Since x can be as low as 28 and as high as ~59.03, this interval does contain all x. But maybe there's a better option. Let's see others.\n\nOption D) 28 <x <60. The lower bound here is exactly the minimum (28), but since at n=36, x is exactly 28. So the inequality is 28 <x, but at n=36, x=28. So the interval D's lower bound is not inclusive. But the question says \"satisfies\" so if the option is written as 28 <x <60, then when x is exactly 28, it's not in the interval. So since n can be 36, which gives x=28, then the correct interval must include 28. So D's lower bound is too strict. \n\nSimilarly, the upper limit of D is 60, but our upper limit is ~59.03, so 59.03 <60, so that's okay. But the problem is the lower bound.\n\nLooking at option C's lower bound is 25, which is lower than 28, so the interval 25<x<64 would include all x. But the question is, which of the options is correct. The options are A to E. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption C is 25 <x<64. Since x can be up to ~59.03, which is less than 64, so the upper bound is okay. The lower is 25, which is less than 28, so the entire x's range is within C's interval. \n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. The lower bound is too strict (since x can be exactly 28 when n=36), so the interval D does not include that point. So if the question is whether x is strictly greater than 28, but since the original n is allowed to be 36 (so x can be 28), then D's interval does not include that. So the correct interval must be one that includes 28 and up to ~59.03. \n\nLooking at the options, C's upper is 64 which is higher, so the entire range is within C. But let's see other options:\n\nOption B is 23<x<58. The upper limit here is 58, but our upper is ~59.03, so that's too low. So B is out.\n\nOption A's upper is 54, which is way lower. So A is out. \n\nOption E is none of these. So the options given are:\n\nC)25 <x <64 includes all x (since 25 is lower than 28, and 64 is higher than 59.03). So the correct answer would be C?\n\nWait but let me check again. Wait the question says \"satisfies\" so maybe the options have a tighter interval that also works. Let me see:\n\nWait, the actual maximum is about 59.03, so 59.03 is less than 60 (option D's upper bound). So D's upper is 60, but since the question's options are ranges, perhaps the answer is D?\n\nWait, but D's lower bound is 28 <x, but x can be exactly 28. So if the inequality is strict (28 < x), then when x is exactly 28, it doesn't satisfy D. So D is not correct. \n\nSo between C and D. Since C's lower bound is 25 <x, which allows the minimum of 28. So C's interval includes all possible x's. \n\nWait, but the options are given as:\n\nC)25 < x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nSo if the question is which interval is correct, then since x can be as low as 28 and as high as ~59.03, the correct interval must include all those values. \n\nC's interval includes all of them. D's interval is partially correct but excludes the lower end (since x=28 is possible). So C is a valid option. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the expression?\n\nWait let me recheck the algebra steps again because maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me substitute t =\u221an, so n = t\u00b2.\n\nNumerator becomes (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nLet me compute that term by term:\n\nFirst term: t^4.\n\nSecond term: 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 +8t.\n\nThird term: +16.\n\nSo total numerator is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator is t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nThen I factored numerator as (t+2)(t^3 +8). Wait, because grouping terms:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 +8t +16 = t^3(t+2) +8(t + 2) \u2192 (t+2)(t^3 +8). \n\nYes, that's correct. Then the denominator is (t+2)^2. So when you divide, you get (t^3 +8)/(t+2). \n\nThen, t^3 +8 factors as (t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4). So dividing by (t+2), gives t\u00b2 -2t +4. \n\nSo x = t\u00b2 -2t +4 = (t^2) - 2t +4. Since t\u00b2 is n, so substituting back gives n -2t +4. Which is correct. \n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4. \n\nYes, that seems right. \n\nSo for n=36, x=36 -2*6 +4= 36-12+4=28. \n\nFor n=72: sqrt(72)= 6*sqrt(2)\u22488.485. So x=72 - 2*(8.485) +4 =72 -16.97 +4= (72+4)=76 -16.97=59.03. \n\nSo the maximum x is about 59.03, which is just under 60. \n\nSo the possible x values are from 28 to ~59.03. \n\nNow looking at the options:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64. Since 25 is less than 28 and 64 is more than 59.03, this interval includes all x's. \n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. The lower bound is 28, but since when n=36, x is exactly 28, the inequality 28 <x would exclude that value. So the interval D is not valid for all x. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C? \n\nWait, but the question says \"satisfies\". So if the question is asking for an interval that x must lie within, then C is correct. However, the problem might have a tighter interval. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)20 < x < 54\n\nB)23 < x < 58\n\nC)25 < x < 64\n\nD)28 < x < 60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm. Since the maximum x is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper limit is okay. The lower limit of D is 28 <x, but x can be exactly 28. So the interval D does not include 28. So if the question requires that x is strictly greater than 28 and less than 60, then when n=36, x=28 would not satisfy D, so D is incorrect. \n\nOption C's lower bound is 25, so x can be 28 which is higher than 25, so that's okay. The upper is 64, which is higher than 59.03, so okay. So C is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake here. Wait maybe I miscalculated the maximum x?\n\nWait let me calculate the maximum again. Let me do it more precisely. \n\nn=72. sqrt(72)=sqrt(36*2)=6*sqrt(2)= approximately 6*1.41421356 \u2248 8.48528137. \n\nSo x=72 - 2*(8.48528137) +4 \n\nCalculate 2*8.48528137 = 16.97056274 \n\nThen 72 -16.97056274 = 55.02943726 \n\nThen add 4: 55.02943726 +4 =59.02943726 \n\nSo approximately 59.03. So that's correct. \n\nSo the maximum x is about 59.03. \n\nSo the upper bound of D is 60, which is higher than 59.03, so the interval D's upper is okay. But the lower is 28 <x. \n\nWait the question says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\", so n can be exactly 36, which gives x=28. So x can be exactly 28. The interval D says \"28 <x\", so x=28 would not be included. Therefore, D is not correct for all possible x. \n\nTherefore, the only interval that includes all possible x is option C. \n\nBut let me check if the problem requires strict inequalities or if the endpoints are included. The question says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\" so n can be 36 or 72, so x can be 28 or ~59.03. The options given have inequalities with < signs. For example, option C is 25 <x <64. Since 25 is less than 28, and 64 is more than 59.03, the endpoints are okay. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C. \n\nWait but let me check if there's another possible mistake. Let me test another value of n in the middle, like n=64. \n\nAt n=64, sqrt(n)=8. \n\nx=64 -2*8 +4 =64-16+4=52. \n\nSo x=52. \n\nSo for n=64, x=52. \n\nIf I check the options:\n\nC: 25 <52<64 \u2192 yes.\n\nD: 28<52<60 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo in this case, both C and D would include 52. But since the minimal x is exactly 28, which is not included in D's lower bound, but included in C. So the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the tightest interval? But the options don't specify that. Since the question says \"satisfies\", the answer is the one that contains all possible x. \n\nSo the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check option D again. The upper limit is 60, which is higher than the maximum x of ~59.03. So the upper bound is okay. The lower bound is 28 <x. Since x can be 28 exactly, then D's interval does not include that, so it's invalid. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C says 25 <x <64. The question is, does x ever get below 25? Well, the minimal x is 28, so no. So 25 is safe as the lower bound. The upper is 64, which is more than enough. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because the maximum is under 60, which is option D's upper limit. But since the lower bound of D is too strict, then C is the only valid option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck the numerator and denominator again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again. The numerator is n squared plus 2 times sqrt(n) times (n+4) plus 16. Yes, that's how I interpreted it. \n\nYes, so when substituting t=\u221an, the numerator is indeed t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. \n\nThen the factoring steps were correct. So the simplification to x = t^2 -2t +4 is correct. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is correct. \n\nThus, the answer is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Wait the options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nHmm. Wait the maximum x is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so the upper bound of D is okay. The lower bound of D is 28 <x, but x can be exactly 28. So the interval D is not including the minimum. Therefore, the correct interval must include 28. So the only option that includes all possible x values is C. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where n is between 36 and 72, and then figure out which interval x falls into. The expression for x is given as (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify the numerator and denominator first.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator. Let me see. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Hmm, the denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let me see if those are perfect squares or something.\n\nLet me think. The denominator: n +4\u221an +4. Let me substitute \u221an as a variable. Let\u2019s say let\u2019s let t = \u221an. Then n is t\u00b2. So substituting, the denominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4. Oh! That's a perfect square! Because t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t +2)^2. So denominator is (\u221an +2)^2. \n\nWhat about the numerator? The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me also express that in terms of t. Since n is t\u00b2, then:\n\nNumerator becomes (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term is t^4. The second term is 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 +8t. The third term is 16. So adding all together:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, maybe this can be factored as well? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is also a perfect square. Let me check. Let me think of the numerator as something squared. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the numerator is (t^2 + a t + b)^2? Let's see:\n\nExpanding (t\u00b2 + a t + b)^2 would give t^4 + 2a t^3 + (a\u00b2 + 2b) t^2 + 2ab t + b\u00b2. Comparing coefficients with numerator's terms (t^4 +2t^3 +0 t^2 +8t +16). \n\nHmm, so coefficients:\n\nThe t^4 term matches. For t^3: 2a must equal 2, so a=1.\n\nThen for the t^2 term: a\u00b2 + 2b must equal 0 (since there's no t\u00b2 term in numerator). Since a is 1, that gives 1 + 2b =0 \u2192 2b= -1 \u2192 b= -0.5. But then let's check the next terms.\n\nThe t term would be 2ab t: 2*(1)*(-0.5)= -1, but in the numerator it's +8t. So that doesn't match. So that approach might not work. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (t^2 + something)^2 plus or minus something? Let me try another approach. Maybe the numerator can be written as (t^2 + 2t + 4)^2? Let me compute that.\n\n(t^2 +2t +4)^2 = t^4 +4t^3 + (4t^2 + 16t) + 16? Wait, no, let me actually expand it properly:\n\n(t^2 + 2t +4)^2 = (t^2)^2 + (2t)^2 + (4)^2 + 2*(t^2*2t + t^2*4 + 2t*4)\n\nWait, no, better to expand step by step:\n\nFirst, (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. Here a = t\u00b2, b=2t, c=4.\n\nSo, (t\u00b2)^2 + (2t)^2 +4\u00b2 + 2*(t\u00b2*2t + t\u00b2*4 + 2t*4)\n\nWait, that's t^4 +4t\u00b2 +16 + 2*(2t^3 +4t\u00b2 +8t). Let me compute that:\n\n= t^4 +4t\u00b2 +16 +4t^3 +8t\u00b2 +16t \n\nCombine like terms: t^4 +4t^3 + (4t\u00b2 +8t\u00b2) = 12t\u00b2, plus 16t, plus 16. So that's t^4 +4t^3 +12t\u00b2 +16t +16. Not the same as the numerator which is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. So that's not matching. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let me go back to the original numerator:\n\nOriginal numerator in terms of t is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Wait, perhaps grouping terms?\n\nLet me see, group t^4 + 2t^3 and 8t +16. \n\nFirst group: t^3(t +2). Second group: 8(t +2). So that would be (t^3 +8)(t+2). Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, t^4 +2t^3 = t^3(t +2), and 8t +16 =8(t +2). So then, factoring (t+2):\n\nt^3(t+2) +8(t+2) = (t+2)(t^3 +8). \n\nAh! Oh, that's a good step! So numerator becomes (t+2)(t^3 +8). Then, the denominator is (t+2)^2. So x = numerator/denominator = [ (t+2)(t^3 +8) ] / (t+2)^2 ) = (t^3 +8)/(t+2).\n\nSimplify that. Now, t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. Remember that a^3 +b^3 = (a +b)(a^2 -ab +b^2). So here, a = t, b=2, since 2^3 is 8. So:\n\nt^3 +8 = (t +2)(t^2 -2t +4). \n\nTherefore, substituting back into x:\n\nx = [ (t +2)(t^2 - 2t +4) ] / (t +2) ) \n\nCancel out (t+2) terms (since t = sqrt(n), which is positive and since n is between 36 and 72, t is between 6 and 8.485, so t+2 is not zero, so cancellation is okay). \n\nThus, x simplifies to t^2 -2t +4. \n\nBut wait, t is sqrt(n), so substituting back:\n\nx = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, t^2 is n. So t^2 -2t +4 is n - 2\u221an +4. So x = n - 2\u221an +4. \n\nHmm, that's a much simpler expression. So now, the problem reduces to finding the range of x when n is between 36 and 72. \n\nSo let's compute x for n=36 and n=72, and also check if it's increasing or decreasing in between to find the min and max. \n\nFirst, let's compute x at n=36:\n\nsqrt(36)=6. So x =36 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28.\n\nAt n=72, sqrt(72)= approx 8.485. Let's compute exactly:\n\nsqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2)\u22488.48528.\n\nSo x =72 -2*(8.48528) +4 \u224872 -16.97056 +4 \u224872+4 is 76, minus 16.97056 gives \u224859.02944. \n\nWait, so when n=72, x\u224859.03. \n\nWait, so when n increases from 36 to 72, what happens to x? Let's see the function x(n) = n -2\u221an +4. Let me see the derivative to check if it's increasing or decreasing. \n\nTaking derivative dx/dn = 1 - 2*(1/(2\u221an)) +0 = 1 - (1/\u221an). Since n \u226536, sqrt(n) is at least 6. So 1/sqrt(n) \u22641/6. So 1 - (1/sqrt(n)) is at least 1 -1/6=5/6>0. So derivative is always positive. So x is increasing in n. \n\nTherefore, the minimum x is at n=36 (28) and the maximum x is at n=72 (\u224859.03). \n\nSo the range of x is from 28 to approximately 59.03. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 but 54 is less than the upper limit here (59), so this is too low.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 the upper limit here is 58, which is still under 59.03, so the upper bound is too low.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 lower bound is okay, but upper is 64. Since x can go up to ~59, which is less than 64. So the upper bound here is higher than needed, but the lower bound is lower than the actual minimum (since minimum x is 28). So 25 is okay but the lower bound is okay, but the minimum is 28, so the interval starts below, but the actual x never goes below 28, so 25 <x would include that, but the options are about the ranges that x satisfies. The question says \"satisfies\" so the correct interval must fully contain all possible x values. Since the minimum is 28, any option that has lower bound less than 28 would still include the actual values. But the options are about which interval x is in. Wait the question says \"x satisfies\", so the correct option must be an interval that contains all possible x. Let me check each option again.\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64. Since x can be as low as 28 and as high as ~59.03, this interval does contain all x. But maybe there's a better option. Let's see others.\n\nOption D) 28 <x <60. The lower bound here is exactly the minimum (28), but since at n=36, x is exactly 28. So the inequality is 28 <x, but at n=36, x=28. So the interval D's lower bound is not inclusive. But the question says \"satisfies\" so if the option is written as 28 <x <60, then when x is exactly 28, it's not in the interval. So since n can be 36, which gives x=28, then the correct interval must include 28. So D's lower bound is too strict. \n\nSimilarly, the upper limit of D is 60, but our upper limit is ~59.03, so 59.03 <60, so that's okay. But the problem is the lower bound.\n\nLooking at option C's lower bound is 25, which is lower than 28, so the interval 25<x<64 would include all x. But the question is, which of the options is correct. The options are A to E. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption C is 25 <x<64. Since x can be up to ~59.03, which is less than 64, so the upper bound is okay. The lower is 25, which is less than 28, so the entire x's range is within C's interval. \n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. The lower bound is too strict (since x can be exactly 28 when n=36), so the interval D does not include that point. So if the question is whether x is strictly greater than 28, but since the original n is allowed to be 36 (so x can be 28), then D's interval does not include that. So the correct interval must be one that includes 28 and up to ~59.03. \n\nLooking at the options, C's upper is 64 which is higher, so the entire range is within C. But let's see other options:\n\nOption B is 23<x<58. The upper limit here is 58, but our upper is ~59.03, so that's too low. So B is out.\n\nOption A's upper is 54, which is way lower. So A is out. \n\nOption E is none of these. So the options given are:\n\nC)25 <x <64 includes all x (since 25 is lower than 28, and 64 is higher than 59.03). So the correct answer would be C?\n\nWait but let me check again. Wait the question says \"satisfies\" so maybe the options have a tighter interval that also works. Let me see:\n\nWait, the actual maximum is about 59.03, so 59.03 is less than 60 (option D's upper bound). So D's upper is 60, but since the question's options are ranges, perhaps the answer is D?\n\nWait, but D's lower bound is 28 <x, but x can be exactly 28. So if the inequality is strict (28 < x), then when x is exactly 28, it doesn't satisfy D. So D is not correct. \n\nSo between C and D. Since C's lower bound is 25 <x, which allows the minimum of 28. So C's interval includes all possible x's. \n\nWait, but the options are given as:\n\nC)25 < x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nSo if the question is which interval is correct, then since x can be as low as 28 and as high as ~59.03, the correct interval must include all those values. \n\nC's interval includes all of them. D's interval is partially correct but excludes the lower end (since x=28 is possible). So C is a valid option. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the expression?\n\nWait let me recheck the algebra steps again because maybe I messed up somewhere. Let me go back step by step.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me substitute t =\u221an, so n = t\u00b2.\n\nNumerator becomes (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nLet me compute that term by term:\n\nFirst term: t^4.\n\nSecond term: 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 +8t.\n\nThird term: +16.\n\nSo total numerator is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator is t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nThen I factored numerator as (t+2)(t^3 +8). Wait, because grouping terms:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 +8t +16 = t^3(t+2) +8(t + 2) \u2192 (t+2)(t^3 +8). \n\nYes, that's correct. Then the denominator is (t+2)^2. So when you divide, you get (t^3 +8)/(t+2). \n\nThen, t^3 +8 factors as (t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4). So dividing by (t+2), gives t\u00b2 -2t +4. \n\nSo x = t\u00b2 -2t +4 = (t^2) - 2t +4. Since t\u00b2 is n, so substituting back gives n -2t +4. Which is correct. \n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4. \n\nYes, that seems right. \n\nSo for n=36, x=36 -2*6 +4= 36-12+4=28. \n\nFor n=72: sqrt(72)= 6*sqrt(2)\u22488.485. So x=72 - 2*(8.485) +4 =72 -16.97 +4= (72+4)=76 -16.97=59.03. \n\nSo the maximum x is about 59.03, which is just under 60. \n\nSo the possible x values are from 28 to ~59.03. \n\nNow looking at the options:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64. Since 25 is less than 28 and 64 is more than 59.03, this interval includes all x's. \n\nOption D: 28 <x <60. The lower bound is 28, but since when n=36, x is exactly 28, the inequality 28 <x would exclude that value. So the interval D is not valid for all x. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C? \n\nWait, but the question says \"satisfies\". So if the question is asking for an interval that x must lie within, then C is correct. However, the problem might have a tighter interval. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)20 < x < 54\n\nB)23 < x < 58\n\nC)25 < x < 64\n\nD)28 < x < 60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm. Since the maximum x is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper limit is okay. The lower limit of D is 28 <x, but x can be exactly 28. So the interval D does not include 28. So if the question requires that x is strictly greater than 28 and less than 60, then when n=36, x=28 would not satisfy D, so D is incorrect. \n\nOption C's lower bound is 25, so x can be 28 which is higher than 25, so that's okay. The upper is 64, which is higher than 59.03, so okay. So C is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake here. Wait maybe I miscalculated the maximum x?\n\nWait let me calculate the maximum again. Let me do it more precisely. \n\nn=72. sqrt(72)=sqrt(36*2)=6*sqrt(2)= approximately 6*1.41421356 \u2248 8.48528137. \n\nSo x=72 - 2*(8.48528137) +4 \n\nCalculate 2*8.48528137 = 16.97056274 \n\nThen 72 -16.97056274 = 55.02943726 \n\nThen add 4: 55.02943726 +4 =59.02943726 \n\nSo approximately 59.03. So that's correct. \n\nSo the maximum x is about 59.03. \n\nSo the upper bound of D is 60, which is higher than 59.03, so the interval D's upper is okay. But the lower is 28 <x. \n\nWait the question says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\", so n can be exactly 36, which gives x=28. So x can be exactly 28. The interval D says \"28 <x\", so x=28 would not be included. Therefore, D is not correct for all possible x. \n\nTherefore, the only interval that includes all possible x is option C. \n\nBut let me check if the problem requires strict inequalities or if the endpoints are included. The question says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\" so n can be 36 or 72, so x can be 28 or ~59.03. The options given have inequalities with < signs. For example, option C is 25 <x <64. Since 25 is less than 28, and 64 is more than 59.03, the endpoints are okay. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C. \n\nWait but let me check if there's another possible mistake. Let me test another value of n in the middle, like n=64. \n\nAt n=64, sqrt(n)=8. \n\nx=64 -2*8 +4 =64-16+4=52. \n\nSo x=52. \n\nSo for n=64, x=52. \n\nIf I check the options:\n\nC: 25 <52<64 \u2192 yes.\n\nD: 28<52<60 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo in this case, both C and D would include 52. But since the minimal x is exactly 28, which is not included in D's lower bound, but included in C. So the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is looking for the tightest interval? But the options don't specify that. Since the question says \"satisfies\", the answer is the one that contains all possible x. \n\nSo the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check option D again. The upper limit is 60, which is higher than the maximum x of ~59.03. So the upper bound is okay. The lower bound is 28 <x. Since x can be 28 exactly, then D's interval does not include that, so it's invalid. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C says 25 <x <64. The question is, does x ever get below 25? Well, the minimal x is 28, so no. So 25 is safe as the lower bound. The upper is 64, which is more than enough. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused because the maximum is under 60, which is option D's upper limit. But since the lower bound of D is too strict, then C is the only valid option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck the numerator and denominator again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nWait, let me check the original problem again. The numerator is n squared plus 2 times sqrt(n) times (n+4) plus 16. Yes, that's how I interpreted it. \n\nYes, so when substituting t=\u221an, the numerator is indeed t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. \n\nThen the factoring steps were correct. So the simplification to x = t^2 -2t +4 is correct. \n\nTherefore, the conclusion is correct. \n\nThus, the answer is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Wait the options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nHmm. Wait the maximum x is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so the upper bound of D is okay. The lower bound of D is 28 <x, but x can be exactly 28. So the interval D is not including the minimum. Therefore, the correct interval must include 28. So the only option that includes all possible x values is C. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = t^2 \\). Substituting \\( t \\) into the expression:\n\n**Denominator:**  \n\\[\nn + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 = t^2 + 4t + 4 = (t + 2)^2\n\\]\n\n**Numerator:**  \n\\[\nn^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = t^4 + 2t(t^2 + 4) + 16 = t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16\n\\]\n\nWe factor the numerator by grouping terms:  \n\\[\nt^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16 = t^3(t + 2) + 8(t + 2) = (t + 2)(t^3 + 8)\n\\]\n\nRecognizing \\( t^3 + 8 \\) as a sum of cubes:  \n\\[\nt^3 + 8 = (t + 2)(t^2 - 2t + 4)\n\\]\n\nThus, the numerator becomes:  \n\\[\n(t + 2)(t + 2)(t^2 - 2t + 4) = (t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4)\n\\]\n\nDividing numerator by denominator:  \n\\[\nx = \\frac{(t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4)}{(t + 2)^2} = t^2 - 2t + 4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\):  \n\\[\nx = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we evaluate \\( x \\) at the boundaries of \\( n \\) (36 and 72):  \n- For \\( n = 36 \\):  \n  \\[\n  x = 36 - 2(6) + 4 = 28\n  \\]\n- For \\( n = 72 \\):  \n  \\[\n  \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485 \\implies x \\approx 72 - 2(8.485) + 4 \\approx 59.03\n  \\]\n\nThe function \\( x(n) = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\) is increasing (derivative \\( \\frac{dx}{dn} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} > 0 \\)), so \\( x \\) ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.  \n\n**Analysis of Options:**  \n- **A (20 < x < 54):** Excludes values above 54 (e.g., 59.03), incorrect.  \n- **B (23 < x < 58):** Excludes values above 58 (e.g., 59.03), incorrect.  \n- **C (25 < x < 64):** Includes all values (28 \u2264 x \u2264 59.03), correct.  \n- **D (28 < x < 60):** Excludes \\( x = 28 \\), incorrect.  \n- **E (None):** Not applicable since C covers all values.  \n\nThe correct answer is **C**, as it fully contains all possible \\( x \\).\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which interval the value of x falls into, given that n is between 36 and 72. The expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try simplifying the expression for x. Let me write it out again:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) + 16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, the numerator looks a bit like a quadratic or maybe a square. Let me see if I can factor it. Let me look at the numerator:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Hmm, maybe this is a perfect square? Let me check.\n\nSuppose I think of the numerator as something squared. Let me see: If I consider (\u221an + something)^2, maybe?\n\nLet me try expanding (\u221an + a)^2. That would be n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2. Hmm, but our numerator has n squared. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Alternatively, maybe the numerator can be written as (something)^2 + ... Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (n + 2\u221an * something)^2? Let me see.\n\nWait, let me see the terms again:\n\nn\u00b2 is the first term. The next term is 2\u221an(n+4). Let me compute that term: 2\u221an*(n +4) = 2n\u221an + 8\u221an. Then adding 16. So the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way. Let me look at the denominator first. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Hmm, that also looks like a quadratic in terms of \u221an. Let me set t = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, t would be between 6 and sqrt(72) \u22488.485. Maybe substituting t will make things easier.\n\nLet me try substituting t = \u221an. Then n = t\u00b2. Let's rewrite the expression in terms of t.\n\nSo numerator becomes (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) + 16. Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (t\u00b2)^2 = t^4.\n\nSecond term: 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 +8t.\n\nThird term: +16.\n\nSo the numerator is t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nHmm, and the denominator is n +4\u221an +4 = t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nWait, the denominator is t\u00b2 +4t +4. That factors as (t+2)^2. Oh, that's a perfect square!\n\nSo denominator is (t +2)^2.\n\nNow the numerator: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, can this be factored?\n\nLet me see if I can factor numerator. Maybe group terms?\n\nLet me try grouping terms:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Let me see:\n\nFirst two terms: t^3(t + 2)\n\nLast two terms: 8t +16 = 8(t +2). Oh, that's interesting!\n\nSo the numerator becomes t^3(t +2) +8(t +2). So factor out (t +2):\n\n(t +2)(t^3 +8). Wait, t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, since 8=2^3. The formula for a^3 +b^3 = (a +b)(a^2 -ab +b^2). So t^3 +8 = (t +2)(t^2 - 2t +4).\n\nTherefore, numerator is (t +2)*(t +2)*(t^2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2*(t^2 -2t +4).\n\nSo putting numerator over denominator:\n\nNumerator: (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4)\n\nDenominator: (t +2)^2\n\nSo the (t+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nOh! That simplifies things a lot. So x is equal to t squared minus 2t plus 4, where t is sqrt(n). Since t = sqrt(n), then x = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2sqrt(n) +4? Wait, no, wait: Wait, t is sqrt(n), so t squared is n, so substituting back:\n\nWait, wait, let's see:\n\nWait, x is t squared minus 2t plus 4. Because t is sqrt(n), so t squared is n. Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t = sqrt(n), then t squared is n. So substituting back, x = n - 2\u221an +4?\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, the numerator was t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16, which became (t+2)^2*(t^2 - 2t +4). Then divided by denominator (t+2)^2 gives x = t^2 -2t +4. Yes, so x equals t squared minus 2t plus 4. Since t is sqrt(n), so t squared is n, so substituting back:\n\nx = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4. Wait, no, sqrt(n) squared is n, so t squared is n. So x is n minus 2t +4. Because t is sqrt(n). So x = n - 2\u221an +4?\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the numerator after factoring was (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). Then divided by denominator (t+2)^2, so the result is (t\u00b2 -2t +4). But t is sqrt(n), so t squared is n, so substituting back, that's (n - 2t +4). So yes, x = n - 2*sqrt(n) +4.\n\nWait, so x = n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, but that seems a bit odd, but let me check the algebra again.\n\nWait, let me retrace steps:\n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 +2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nWait, let me compute that again with substitution t = sqrt(n):\n\nOriginal numerator: (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16\n\nWhich is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Then factored into (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 - 2t +4). Because:\n\nLet me verify the factorization:\n\n(t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t\u00b2 +4t +4)(t\u00b2 -2t +4)\n\nMultiply those two:\n\nFirst, (t\u00b2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = t^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2\n\nThen 4t*(t\u00b2 -2t +4) =4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t\n\nThen 4*(t\u00b2 -2t +4) =4t\u00b2 -8t +16\n\nAdd all together:\n\nt^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2 +4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t +4t\u00b2 -8t +16\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt^4 + ( -2t^3 +4t^3 ) = t^4 +2t^3\n\nThen 4t\u00b2 -8t\u00b2 +4t\u00b2 = 0 for the t\u00b2 terms?\n\nWait, 4t\u00b2 -8t\u00b2 +4t\u00b2 =0? Hmm, yes, that's right. Then the t terms: 16t -8t =8t.\n\nThen constants: +16.\n\nSo total: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Which matches the original numerator. So the factorization is correct. So the numerator is indeed (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). Divided by denominator (t+2)^2, so x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is sqrt(n), then x = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 -2*sqrt(n) +4. Wait, sqrt(n) squared is n. So that's n - 2\u221an +4. Oh, right, so x = n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, that's a much simpler expression. So I need to find x in terms of n, then find the possible range of x when n is between 36 and 72.\n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4. Let me write that as x = (n +4) - 2\u221an. Hmm, maybe I can think of this as a function of n. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe substitute t = sqrt(n), so x = t\u00b2 +4 -2t. So x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. That's a quadratic in terms of t. Let me write that as x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is between 6 and sqrt(72). Let me compute sqrt(72). sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. So t is between 6 and approximately 8.485.\n\nSo now, x is a quadratic function in t, which is t\u00b2 -2t +4. To find the range of x when t is in [6, ~8.485], let's see how this quadratic behaves.\n\nThe quadratic x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4 can be rewritten by completing the square. Let's see:\n\nt\u00b2 -2t +1 +3 = (t-1)^2 +3. So the vertex is at t=1, and the minimum value is 3. Since the coefficient of t\u00b2 is positive, it opens upwards. But since our t is between 6 and ~8.485, which are all to the right of the vertex, the function is increasing in that interval. Therefore, the minimum x occurs at the left end of the interval (t=6) and the maximum at the right end (t= sqrt(72)).\n\nSo compute x at t=6:\n\nx(6) = (6)^2 -2*(6) +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nAt t= sqrt(72):\n\nsqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485281374.\n\nSo x(t) at that point is (8.48528)^2 -2*(8.48528)+4.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, (sqrt(72))\u00b2 is 72. Wait, wait a second! Wait, x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is sqrt(n), then t squared is n. So x = n -2t +4. Wait, but if t = sqrt(72), then t squared is 72. So x would be 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4. Alternatively, in terms of t, x is t squared minus 2t plus4. So when t is sqrt(72), x is (sqrt(72))\u00b2 -2*sqrt(72) +4 = 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4 = 76 - 2*sqrt(72). Wait, that's the same as 76 minus 2 times sqrt(72). But sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2), so 2*sqrt(72)= 12*sqrt(2). Hmm, but perhaps I can calculate the numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the maximum value at t= sqrt(72):\n\nsqrt(72) \u22488.485. So:\n\nx = (8.485)^2 -2*(8.485) +4.\n\nFirst, (8.485)^2: Let's compute that. 8.485 squared. 8^2=64, 0.485^2\u22480.235, cross terms 2*8*0.485\u22487.76. So total approx (64 +7.76 +0.235) but that might not be precise. Alternatively, 8.485 squared:\n\nLet me compute 8.485 *8.485:\n\n8 *8 =64.\n\n8 *0.485 =3.88, so 8.485 *8.485 can be written as (8 +0.485)^2 = 8\u00b2 + 2*8*0.485 + (0.485)^2 = 64 + 7.76 + 0.235225 \u224864+7.76=71.76 +0.235\u224872. So actually, 8.485 squared is exactly 72 (since sqrt(72) squared is 72). Oh right! Because t is sqrt(n), so when n is 72, t is sqrt(72). So then t squared is exactly 72. So substituting back, x at t= sqrt(72) is 72 -2*sqrt(72) +4. Which is 76 - 2*sqrt(72).\n\nWait, sqrt(72)= 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. So 2*sqrt(72)= approx 16.97.\n\nSo 76 -16.97 \u224859.03. So the maximum x is approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4 is (72 +4) - 2*sqrt(72) =76 - 2*sqrt(72). So sqrt(72) is 8.485, so 2* that is about 16.97, so 76-16.97 is 59.03. So the maximum x is approximately 59.03, and the minimum x is 28.\n\nSo the possible values of x are between 28 and approximately 59.03. Looking at the options given:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2014 the upper limit here is 54, but our max is ~59, so A is too low.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2014 upper limit 58, which is close, but still under the actual maximum of ~59.03. Hmm.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2014 upper is 64, which is higher than needed, but the lower is 25 which is lower than our 28. So C's lower is too low.\n\nD)28 <x<60 \u2014 lower exactly matches our minimum of 28, upper is 60 which is slightly higher than the ~59.03. Since the question says \"satisfies\", which interval does it fall into?\n\nThe actual maximum is about 59.03, so 60 would be just above. The minimum is exactly 28. So D's interval is 28 <x<60. Since the maximum is ~59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay, and the lower exactly meets the minimum. So x is between 28 and ~59.03, so D's interval is 28 <x<60, which includes all possible x values. Therefore, D would be correct?\n\nWait, but let me check the endpoints again. Wait when n is 36, t is 6. Then x at t=6 is 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36-12+4=28. So exactly 28. Since the question says 36 \u2264n \u226472, so n=36 is allowed, so x can be 28. But the options are written as \"28 <x<60\". Wait, the option D says \"28 < x < 60\", but since x can be exactly 28, then the inequality is strict. So the actual minimum is 28, so the interval should include 28. But the option D says 28 is excluded. Hmm, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, the question says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\", so n can be exactly 36 or exactly 72. Let's check x when n is 72. Then x would be 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4. Which as we saw is about 59.03. So x can be up to ~59.03, which is less than 60. But when n is 36, x is exactly 28. The options D says \"28 < x <60\", so 28 is excluded. But since x can be equal to 28, then D is not correct.\n\nHmm, so then maybe none of the options are correct? Wait let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these\n\nSo the problem says \"satisfies\", so the correct interval must include all possible x values. Since x can be exactly 28 (when n=36), but D excludes it. The next lower option is C: 25 <x<64. The lower bound here is 25, which is less than 28, so that's okay. The upper bound is 64, which is higher than the maximum x of ~59.03, so that's okay. So C's interval would include all possible x values. Wait but then why did I think D was the answer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, x = n - 2\u221an +4. Let's compute x when n is 36:\n\n36 - 2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 =28. Correct. So x can be 28. So the minimal value is exactly 28, so the interval must include 28. So the lower bound must be \u226428. The options are:\n\nA's lower is 20, so that's okay. But upper is 54, which is lower than the maximum.\n\nB: lower 23, upper 58. The maximum x is ~59, so upper 58 is too low.\n\nC: lower 25, upper 64. The lower is okay (25 <28), upper okay.\n\nD: lower 28 (strict), which is problematic. So the minimal x is 28, so the interval must start at 28 or below. Since D starts at 28 exclusive, it's invalid. So the correct interval would be C, since it allows x to be as low as just above 25, which is less than 28. But wait, the minimal x is exactly 28, so 25 < x <64 includes all x's. So C would be correct?\n\nWait but the question is, which of the options is correct. The actual x values are between 28 (inclusive) and ~59.03 (exclusive). So the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x < ~59.03. Looking at the options:\n\nC says 25 <x <64. Since 25 is less than 28, the lower bound is okay. The upper 64 is more than the max. So all x's are in C's interval. But the problem says \"satisfies\", so maybe it's possible that the options have a better fit?\n\nAlternatively, let me check the maximum again. Let me compute exactly the value when n=72:\n\nx =72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4 =76 - 2*sqrt(72).\n\nsqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485281374.\n\n2*sqrt(72)=12*sqrt(2)= approx 16.97056275.\n\n76 -16.97056275 \u224859.02943725. So about 59.03.\n\nSo the maximum x is approximately 59.03. So the upper limit of the options:\n\nC's upper is 64. So 59.03 is less than 64, so that's okay. The lower is 25, which is less than 28. So all x values are in C's interval. So C would be correct?\n\nBut then why does option D exist? Let me check again.\n\nWait the options:\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nHmm, the maximum x is ~59.03, which is less than 60. So the upper bound of D is acceptable. The lower bound of D is 28, but since x can be exactly 28 (when n=36), but D says \"28 < x\", so x=28 is excluded. So D is not correct. However, C's lower is 25 which is lower than 28. So the correct interval must include all x between 28 and ~59.03, so the only option that includes all these values is C. Because D's lower bound is too high (excludes the minimal x), and the upper bound of D is okay but the lower is not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me re-examine the problem step by step.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, let me check the numerator again. The user wrote:\n\n\"n2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16\". Wait, \"n2\" probably means n squared. So the numerator is n squared plus 2\u221an*(n +4) plus 16.\n\nYes, which when substituting t=\u221an becomes t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Which factors into (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2-2t+4). Divided by denominator (t+2)^2, so x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So x = t^2 -2t +4, with t between 6 and sqrt(72). So when t=6, x is 36-12+4=28. When t=sqrt(72)=~8.485, x is 72 - 2*8.485 +4 = 76 - 16.97=59.03.\n\nTherefore the possible x is from 28 to ~59.03. So the interval must include all numbers from 28 up to ~59.03. So the options:\n\nA)20-54: upper too low.\n\nB)23-58: upper 58 is under 59.03.\n\nC)25-64: lower okay, upper okay.\n\nD)28-60: lower is 28, but since x can be exactly 28, but D says 28 is excluded (because it's strict inequality). The maximum is under 60, so the upper is okay. But since 28 is attainable, D's lower bound is wrong.\n\nSo between C and D, which one is correct?\n\nThe problem states \"satisfies\" \u2014 so the correct interval must contain all x values. So C's interval includes all x, but D's does not include the lower end. However, maybe the question is considering open intervals, so if x can be exactly 28, then the interval must include that point. Since D excludes it, but C includes it (since 25 <x, and 28 is greater than 25). Therefore, the correct answer is C?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\". So n can be 36, which gives x=28. The options:\n\nC says 25 <x<64. Since 28 is greater than 25, so 28 is included in C's interval. The upper is 64 which is higher than 59.03, so that's okay. So C's interval includes all possible x values. So C is correct?\n\nBut then why is option D there? Because the minimal x is exactly 28, so the minimal possible x is 28. The problem's options might have a better fit. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D is 28 <x<60. The minimal x is 28, so D's lower bound is exclusive, which would exclude the minimal value. So D is not correct. So C is the only one that includes all possible x.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\". So if the answer is C, but maybe I missed something else. Let me check if the expression x can actually reach up to 60.\n\nWait, when n approaches 72 from below, x approaches ~59.03. So it never reaches 60. So D's upper limit is 60, which is okay. But the lower limit is 28, which is not okay. So C is the only one that includes all values. Therefore the correct answer is C?\n\nWait but looking at the options again:\n\nWait, option C says 25 <x <64. The actual range is 28 to ~59.03. So all x values are between 25 and 64? Yes, since 28 is bigger than 25 and 59 is less than 64. So C is correct. So the answer is C?\n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm. The problem is, if the question is multiple choice and the options are as such, then C is the only one that fully contains the interval. But perhaps the question is expecting a tighter interval. For instance, the actual maximum is about 59, so the upper bound of 60 in D is very close. But since the question is in integers?\n\nWait the problem didn't specify if n is an integer. The question says 36 \u2264 n \u226472. So n can be any real number in that interval. So sqrt(72) is allowed. So the maximum x is ~59.03. So the upper limit of D is 60 which is higher than that. So D's upper bound is okay. But since the minimal x is exactly 28, D's lower bound is 28 <x, so 28 is excluded. Therefore, D is not correct.\n\nHence the only correct option is C. Therefore the answer is C?\n\nWait but maybe the question is written in a way that the inequalities are strict. The original problem says \"satisfies\" \u2014 so the correct interval must be the minimal one that contains all possible x. Since the actual range is [28, ~59.03], then the options must include that interval. The best fit would be D if the inequalities were inclusive, but they are strict. So since D's lower bound excludes 28, but the minimal x is exactly 28, then D is not correct. The next best is C. So the answer must be C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra? Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the expression for x again step by step:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me substitute n = t\u00b2 (so t = sqrt(n)), then:\n\nNumerator becomes (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16\n\n= t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t +16.\n\nDenominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nFactor numerator: Let me see if (t+2)^2 is a factor. Wait earlier steps showed that numerator factors into (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2-2t+4). Let me verify again:\n\nMultiply (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2-2t+4):\n\nFirst, (t+2)^2 = t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nMultiply by (t\u00b2-2t+4):\n\n(t\u00b2+4t+4)(t\u00b2-2t+4) \n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst, t\u00b2*(t\u00b2-2t+4) = t^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2\n\n4t*(t\u00b2-2t+4) =4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t\n\n4*(t\u00b2-2t+4)=4t\u00b2 -8t +16\n\nAdding all together:\n\nt^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2 +4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t +4t\u00b2 -8t +16\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt^4 + ( -2t^3 +4t^3 ) = t^4 +2t^3\n\nFor t\u00b2 terms:4t\u00b2 -8t\u00b2 +4t\u00b2 = 0\n\nFor t terms:16t-8t =8t\n\nConstants: +16.\n\nSo total numerator: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Which matches. So the factoring is correct. Therefore, the simplification is correct, leading to x = t\u00b2-2t+4 =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nThus the previous analysis holds. So the correct answer is C, option C.\n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nThe minimal x is 28, so 25 is lower, so that's okay. The maximum is ~59 <64. So yes, all x are in C's interval.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is C. But let me look back at the options again to be sure. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm, but wait, the maximum is ~59.03. So D's upper limit is 60. Since 59.03 is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay, but the lower bound is 28 <x. Since x can be exactly 28, then the interval 28 <x <60 would exclude the case when x=28, which is possible. So D is incorrect. So the only option that fully contains the interval [28, ~59.03] is option C. Hence the correct answer is C.\n\nWait but the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should check if the expression for x is correct.\n\nWait, let me take a value of n between 36 and 72, say n=49 (so t=7). Then x would be 49 -2*7 +4 =49-14+4=39. Let's plug into the original equation to see if that's correct.\n\nOriginal numerator when n=49:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16 =49\u00b2 + 2*7*(49+4) +16.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n49\u00b2 is 2401.\n\n2*7*(53)=14*53=742.\n\nAdding 16 gives total numerator:2401 +742 +16 = 2401+742=3143 +16=3159.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4 =49 +4*7 +4 =49+28+4=81.\n\nSo x=3159 /81. Let's compute that: 81*39 = 3159. So yes, 3159/81=39. Which matches the simplified expression's result (39). So the simplification is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=36. Then x=28 as before. Original calculation:\n\nNumerator:36\u00b2 +2*6*(36+4)+16 = 1296 + 2*6*40 +16 =1296 +480 +16=1792.\n\nDenominator:36 +4*6 +4 =36+24+4=64. 1792/64=28. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=72:\n\nNumerator:72\u00b2 +2*sqrt(72)*(72+4)+16. sqrt(72)=approx8.485.\n\n72\u00b2 is 5184. 2*8.485*(76) =2*8.485*76. Let's compute:\n\nFirst 8.485 *76: 8*76=608, 0.485*76\u224836.86. So total\u2248608+36.86=644.86. Multiply by 2: ~1289.72. Then adding 16 gives numerator\u22485184 +1289.72 +16\u22485184+1305.72\u22486489.72.\n\nDenominator:72 +4*sqrt(72)+4 =72+4*8.485+4 \u224872+33.94+4\u2248109.94.\n\nThen x\u22486489.72 /109.94 \u2248 let's see: 109.94 *59 \u22486481.46. Which is close to numerator 6489.72, so 59.03. Which matches the earlier calculation. So the simplification is correct.\n\nTherefore the answer must be option C. So the correct answer is C.\n\nWait but wait! Wait the options are written as:\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nBut the minimal x is 28. So 25 <x is okay because 28>25. The maximum is ~59.03 <64. So yes, all x are in C's interval. So answer C. But let me check if any of the other options could also include all x.\n\nOption D's interval is 28 <x <60. The minimal x is exactly 28, so it's excluded. So some x (like 28) is not in D's interval. So D is incorrect. Option B's upper limit is 58, which is under 59.03, so some x would be above 58. So B is out. A's upper is 54, which is too low. So the only possible answer is C. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\". So perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me see the options again. The question is from 36 \u2264n \u226472. The expression for x is (n squared + ...). Wait, but when n is 36, x is exactly 28. So the minimum value is 28. The maximum is ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, option C says 25 <x <64, which includes all possible x. So the correct answer must be C.\n\nWait but the initial thought was D, but D excludes the lower end. So I think the correct answer is C. Therefore, I should choose option C.\n\nWait, but wait! Wait, let me check the original question again. The problem says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\", so n can be 36, which gives x=28. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64. So 28 is within that interval, so it's okay.\n\nD)28 <x <60. 28 is excluded, so if the question requires the inequality to hold strictly (i.e., x must be less than 60 and greater than 28), but when n=36, x=28, so it's not greater than 28. Hence D is incorrect.\n\nThus the correct answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which interval the value of x falls into, given that n is between 36 and 72. The expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, maybe I should try simplifying the expression for x. Let me write it out again:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) + 16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, the numerator looks a bit like a quadratic or maybe a square. Let me see if I can factor it. Let me look at the numerator:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Hmm, maybe this is a perfect square? Let me check.\n\nSuppose I think of the numerator as something squared. Let me see: If I consider (\u221an + something)^2, maybe?\n\nLet me try expanding (\u221an + a)^2. That would be n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2. Hmm, but our numerator has n squared. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Alternatively, maybe the numerator can be written as (something)^2 + ... Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (n + 2\u221an * something)^2? Let me see.\n\nWait, let me see the terms again:\n\nn\u00b2 is the first term. The next term is 2\u221an(n+4). Let me compute that term: 2\u221an*(n +4) = 2n\u221an + 8\u221an. Then adding 16. So the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2n\u221an +8\u221an +16.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way. Let me look at the denominator first. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Hmm, that also looks like a quadratic in terms of \u221an. Let me set t = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, t would be between 6 and sqrt(72) \u22488.485. Maybe substituting t will make things easier.\n\nLet me try substituting t = \u221an. Then n = t\u00b2. Let's rewrite the expression in terms of t.\n\nSo numerator becomes (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) + 16. Let's compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (t\u00b2)^2 = t^4.\n\nSecond term: 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 +8t.\n\nThird term: +16.\n\nSo the numerator is t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nHmm, and the denominator is n +4\u221an +4 = t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nWait, the denominator is t\u00b2 +4t +4. That factors as (t+2)^2. Oh, that's a perfect square!\n\nSo denominator is (t +2)^2.\n\nNow the numerator: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, can this be factored?\n\nLet me see if I can factor numerator. Maybe group terms?\n\nLet me try grouping terms:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Let me see:\n\nFirst two terms: t^3(t + 2)\n\nLast two terms: 8t +16 = 8(t +2). Oh, that's interesting!\n\nSo the numerator becomes t^3(t +2) +8(t +2). So factor out (t +2):\n\n(t +2)(t^3 +8). Wait, t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, since 8=2^3. The formula for a^3 +b^3 = (a +b)(a^2 -ab +b^2). So t^3 +8 = (t +2)(t^2 - 2t +4).\n\nTherefore, numerator is (t +2)*(t +2)*(t^2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2*(t^2 -2t +4).\n\nSo putting numerator over denominator:\n\nNumerator: (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4)\n\nDenominator: (t +2)^2\n\nSo the (t+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nOh! That simplifies things a lot. So x is equal to t squared minus 2t plus 4, where t is sqrt(n). Since t = sqrt(n), then x = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2sqrt(n) +4? Wait, no, wait: Wait, t is sqrt(n), so t squared is n, so substituting back:\n\nWait, wait, let's see:\n\nWait, x is t squared minus 2t plus 4. Because t is sqrt(n), so t squared is n. Wait no, wait:\n\nWait, x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t = sqrt(n), then t squared is n. So substituting back, x = n - 2\u221an +4?\n\nWait, wait, no. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, the numerator was t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16, which became (t+2)^2*(t^2 - 2t +4). Then divided by denominator (t+2)^2 gives x = t^2 -2t +4. Yes, so x equals t squared minus 2t plus 4. Since t is sqrt(n), so t squared is n, so substituting back:\n\nx = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4. Wait, no, sqrt(n) squared is n, so t squared is n. So x is n minus 2t +4. Because t is sqrt(n). So x = n - 2\u221an +4?\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, the numerator after factoring was (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). Then divided by denominator (t+2)^2, so the result is (t\u00b2 -2t +4). But t is sqrt(n), so t squared is n, so substituting back, that's (n - 2t +4). So yes, x = n - 2*sqrt(n) +4.\n\nWait, so x = n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, but that seems a bit odd, but let me check the algebra again.\n\nWait, let me retrace steps:\n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 +2\u221an(n +4) +16.\n\nWait, let me compute that again with substitution t = sqrt(n):\n\nOriginal numerator: (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16\n\nWhich is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Then factored into (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 - 2t +4). Because:\n\nLet me verify the factorization:\n\n(t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t\u00b2 +4t +4)(t\u00b2 -2t +4)\n\nMultiply those two:\n\nFirst, (t\u00b2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = t^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2\n\nThen 4t*(t\u00b2 -2t +4) =4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t\n\nThen 4*(t\u00b2 -2t +4) =4t\u00b2 -8t +16\n\nAdd all together:\n\nt^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2 +4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t +4t\u00b2 -8t +16\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt^4 + ( -2t^3 +4t^3 ) = t^4 +2t^3\n\nThen 4t\u00b2 -8t\u00b2 +4t\u00b2 = 0 for the t\u00b2 terms?\n\nWait, 4t\u00b2 -8t\u00b2 +4t\u00b2 =0? Hmm, yes, that's right. Then the t terms: 16t -8t =8t.\n\nThen constants: +16.\n\nSo total: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Which matches the original numerator. So the factorization is correct. So the numerator is indeed (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). Divided by denominator (t+2)^2, so x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is sqrt(n), then x = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 -2*sqrt(n) +4. Wait, sqrt(n) squared is n. So that's n - 2\u221an +4. Oh, right, so x = n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, that's a much simpler expression. So I need to find x in terms of n, then find the possible range of x when n is between 36 and 72.\n\nSo x = n - 2\u221an +4. Let me write that as x = (n +4) - 2\u221an. Hmm, maybe I can think of this as a function of n. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe substitute t = sqrt(n), so x = t\u00b2 +4 -2t. So x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. That's a quadratic in terms of t. Let me write that as x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is between 6 and sqrt(72). Let me compute sqrt(72). sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. So t is between 6 and approximately 8.485.\n\nSo now, x is a quadratic function in t, which is t\u00b2 -2t +4. To find the range of x when t is in [6, ~8.485], let's see how this quadratic behaves.\n\nThe quadratic x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4 can be rewritten by completing the square. Let's see:\n\nt\u00b2 -2t +1 +3 = (t-1)^2 +3. So the vertex is at t=1, and the minimum value is 3. Since the coefficient of t\u00b2 is positive, it opens upwards. But since our t is between 6 and ~8.485, which are all to the right of the vertex, the function is increasing in that interval. Therefore, the minimum x occurs at the left end of the interval (t=6) and the maximum at the right end (t= sqrt(72)).\n\nSo compute x at t=6:\n\nx(6) = (6)^2 -2*(6) +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nAt t= sqrt(72):\n\nsqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485281374.\n\nSo x(t) at that point is (8.48528)^2 -2*(8.48528)+4.\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\nFirst, (sqrt(72))\u00b2 is 72. Wait, wait a second! Wait, x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is sqrt(n), then t squared is n. So x = n -2t +4. Wait, but if t = sqrt(72), then t squared is 72. So x would be 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4. Alternatively, in terms of t, x is t squared minus 2t plus4. So when t is sqrt(72), x is (sqrt(72))\u00b2 -2*sqrt(72) +4 = 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4 = 76 - 2*sqrt(72). Wait, that's the same as 76 minus 2 times sqrt(72). But sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2), so 2*sqrt(72)= 12*sqrt(2). Hmm, but perhaps I can calculate the numerical value.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the maximum value at t= sqrt(72):\n\nsqrt(72) \u22488.485. So:\n\nx = (8.485)^2 -2*(8.485) +4.\n\nFirst, (8.485)^2: Let's compute that. 8.485 squared. 8^2=64, 0.485^2\u22480.235, cross terms 2*8*0.485\u22487.76. So total approx (64 +7.76 +0.235) but that might not be precise. Alternatively, 8.485 squared:\n\nLet me compute 8.485 *8.485:\n\n8 *8 =64.\n\n8 *0.485 =3.88, so 8.485 *8.485 can be written as (8 +0.485)^2 = 8\u00b2 + 2*8*0.485 + (0.485)^2 = 64 + 7.76 + 0.235225 \u224864+7.76=71.76 +0.235\u224872. So actually, 8.485 squared is exactly 72 (since sqrt(72) squared is 72). Oh right! Because t is sqrt(n), so when n is 72, t is sqrt(72). So then t squared is exactly 72. So substituting back, x at t= sqrt(72) is 72 -2*sqrt(72) +4. Which is 76 - 2*sqrt(72).\n\nWait, sqrt(72)= 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. So 2*sqrt(72)= approx 16.97.\n\nSo 76 -16.97 \u224859.03. So the maximum x is approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Wait, 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4 is (72 +4) - 2*sqrt(72) =76 - 2*sqrt(72). So sqrt(72) is 8.485, so 2* that is about 16.97, so 76-16.97 is 59.03. So the maximum x is approximately 59.03, and the minimum x is 28.\n\nSo the possible values of x are between 28 and approximately 59.03. Looking at the options given:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2014 the upper limit here is 54, but our max is ~59, so A is too low.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2014 upper limit 58, which is close, but still under the actual maximum of ~59.03. Hmm.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2014 upper is 64, which is higher than needed, but the lower is 25 which is lower than our 28. So C's lower is too low.\n\nD)28 <x<60 \u2014 lower exactly matches our minimum of 28, upper is 60 which is slightly higher than the ~59.03. Since the question says \"satisfies\", which interval does it fall into?\n\nThe actual maximum is about 59.03, so 60 would be just above. The minimum is exactly 28. So D's interval is 28 <x<60. Since the maximum is ~59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay, and the lower exactly meets the minimum. So x is between 28 and ~59.03, so D's interval is 28 <x<60, which includes all possible x values. Therefore, D would be correct?\n\nWait, but let me check the endpoints again. Wait when n is 36, t is 6. Then x at t=6 is 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36-12+4=28. So exactly 28. Since the question says 36 \u2264n \u226472, so n=36 is allowed, so x can be 28. But the options are written as \"28 <x<60\". Wait, the option D says \"28 < x < 60\", but since x can be exactly 28, then the inequality is strict. So the actual minimum is 28, so the interval should include 28. But the option D says 28 is excluded. Hmm, so that's a problem.\n\nWait, the question says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\", so n can be exactly 36 or exactly 72. Let's check x when n is 72. Then x would be 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4. Which as we saw is about 59.03. So x can be up to ~59.03, which is less than 60. But when n is 36, x is exactly 28. The options D says \"28 < x <60\", so 28 is excluded. But since x can be equal to 28, then D is not correct.\n\nHmm, so then maybe none of the options are correct? Wait let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these\n\nSo the problem says \"satisfies\", so the correct interval must include all possible x values. Since x can be exactly 28 (when n=36), but D excludes it. The next lower option is C: 25 <x<64. The lower bound here is 25, which is less than 28, so that's okay. The upper bound is 64, which is higher than the maximum x of ~59.03, so that's okay. So C's interval would include all possible x values. Wait but then why did I think D was the answer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, x = n - 2\u221an +4. Let's compute x when n is 36:\n\n36 - 2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 =28. Correct. So x can be 28. So the minimal value is exactly 28, so the interval must include 28. So the lower bound must be \u226428. The options are:\n\nA's lower is 20, so that's okay. But upper is 54, which is lower than the maximum.\n\nB: lower 23, upper 58. The maximum x is ~59, so upper 58 is too low.\n\nC: lower 25, upper 64. The lower is okay (25 <28), upper okay.\n\nD: lower 28 (strict), which is problematic. So the minimal x is 28, so the interval must start at 28 or below. Since D starts at 28 exclusive, it's invalid. So the correct interval would be C, since it allows x to be as low as just above 25, which is less than 28. But wait, the minimal x is exactly 28, so 25 < x <64 includes all x's. So C would be correct?\n\nWait but the question is, which of the options is correct. The actual x values are between 28 (inclusive) and ~59.03 (exclusive). So the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x < ~59.03. Looking at the options:\n\nC says 25 <x <64. Since 25 is less than 28, the lower bound is okay. The upper 64 is more than the max. So all x's are in C's interval. But the problem says \"satisfies\", so maybe it's possible that the options have a better fit?\n\nAlternatively, let me check the maximum again. Let me compute exactly the value when n=72:\n\nx =72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4 =76 - 2*sqrt(72).\n\nsqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485281374.\n\n2*sqrt(72)=12*sqrt(2)= approx 16.97056275.\n\n76 -16.97056275 \u224859.02943725. So about 59.03.\n\nSo the maximum x is approximately 59.03. So the upper limit of the options:\n\nC's upper is 64. So 59.03 is less than 64, so that's okay. The lower is 25, which is less than 28. So all x values are in C's interval. So C would be correct?\n\nBut then why does option D exist? Let me check again.\n\nWait the options:\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nHmm, the maximum x is ~59.03, which is less than 60. So the upper bound of D is acceptable. The lower bound of D is 28, but since x can be exactly 28 (when n=36), but D says \"28 < x\", so x=28 is excluded. So D is not correct. However, C's lower is 25 which is lower than 28. So the correct interval must include all x between 28 and ~59.03, so the only option that includes all these values is C. Because D's lower bound is too high (excludes the minimal x), and the upper bound of D is okay but the lower is not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me re-examine the problem step by step.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, let me check the numerator again. The user wrote:\n\n\"n2 + 2\u221an(n + 4) + 16\". Wait, \"n2\" probably means n squared. So the numerator is n squared plus 2\u221an*(n +4) plus 16.\n\nYes, which when substituting t=\u221an becomes t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Which factors into (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2-2t+4). Divided by denominator (t+2)^2, so x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So x = t^2 -2t +4, with t between 6 and sqrt(72). So when t=6, x is 36-12+4=28. When t=sqrt(72)=~8.485, x is 72 - 2*8.485 +4 = 76 - 16.97=59.03.\n\nTherefore the possible x is from 28 to ~59.03. So the interval must include all numbers from 28 up to ~59.03. So the options:\n\nA)20-54: upper too low.\n\nB)23-58: upper 58 is under 59.03.\n\nC)25-64: lower okay, upper okay.\n\nD)28-60: lower is 28, but since x can be exactly 28, but D says 28 is excluded (because it's strict inequality). The maximum is under 60, so the upper is okay. But since 28 is attainable, D's lower bound is wrong.\n\nSo between C and D, which one is correct?\n\nThe problem states \"satisfies\" \u2014 so the correct interval must contain all x values. So C's interval includes all x, but D's does not include the lower end. However, maybe the question is considering open intervals, so if x can be exactly 28, then the interval must include that point. Since D excludes it, but C includes it (since 25 <x, and 28 is greater than 25). Therefore, the correct answer is C?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the original problem says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\". So n can be 36, which gives x=28. The options:\n\nC says 25 <x<64. Since 28 is greater than 25, so 28 is included in C's interval. The upper is 64 which is higher than 59.03, so that's okay. So C's interval includes all possible x values. So C is correct?\n\nBut then why is option D there? Because the minimal x is exactly 28, so the minimal possible x is 28. The problem's options might have a better fit. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption D is 28 <x<60. The minimal x is 28, so D's lower bound is exclusive, which would exclude the minimal value. So D is not correct. So C is the only one that includes all possible x.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\". So if the answer is C, but maybe I missed something else. Let me check if the expression x can actually reach up to 60.\n\nWait, when n approaches 72 from below, x approaches ~59.03. So it never reaches 60. So D's upper limit is 60, which is okay. But the lower limit is 28, which is not okay. So C is the only one that includes all values. Therefore the correct answer is C?\n\nWait but looking at the options again:\n\nWait, option C says 25 <x <64. The actual range is 28 to ~59.03. So all x values are between 25 and 64? Yes, since 28 is bigger than 25 and 59 is less than 64. So C is correct. So the answer is C?\n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm. The problem is, if the question is multiple choice and the options are as such, then C is the only one that fully contains the interval. But perhaps the question is expecting a tighter interval. For instance, the actual maximum is about 59, so the upper bound of 60 in D is very close. But since the question is in integers?\n\nWait the problem didn't specify if n is an integer. The question says 36 \u2264 n \u226472. So n can be any real number in that interval. So sqrt(72) is allowed. So the maximum x is ~59.03. So the upper limit of D is 60 which is higher than that. So D's upper bound is okay. But since the minimal x is exactly 28, D's lower bound is 28 <x, so 28 is excluded. Therefore, D is not correct.\n\nHence the only correct option is C. Therefore the answer is C?\n\nWait but maybe the question is written in a way that the inequalities are strict. The original problem says \"satisfies\" \u2014 so the correct interval must be the minimal one that contains all possible x. Since the actual range is [28, ~59.03], then the options must include that interval. The best fit would be D if the inequalities were inclusive, but they are strict. So since D's lower bound excludes 28, but the minimal x is exactly 28, then D is not correct. The next best is C. So the answer must be C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra? Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the expression for x again step by step:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me substitute n = t\u00b2 (so t = sqrt(n)), then:\n\nNumerator becomes (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16\n\n= t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t +16.\n\nDenominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nFactor numerator: Let me see if (t+2)^2 is a factor. Wait earlier steps showed that numerator factors into (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2-2t+4). Let me verify again:\n\nMultiply (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2-2t+4):\n\nFirst, (t+2)^2 = t\u00b2 +4t +4.\n\nMultiply by (t\u00b2-2t+4):\n\n(t\u00b2+4t+4)(t\u00b2-2t+4) \n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst, t\u00b2*(t\u00b2-2t+4) = t^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2\n\n4t*(t\u00b2-2t+4) =4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t\n\n4*(t\u00b2-2t+4)=4t\u00b2 -8t +16\n\nAdding all together:\n\nt^4 -2t^3 +4t\u00b2 +4t^3 -8t\u00b2 +16t +4t\u00b2 -8t +16\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt^4 + ( -2t^3 +4t^3 ) = t^4 +2t^3\n\nFor t\u00b2 terms:4t\u00b2 -8t\u00b2 +4t\u00b2 = 0\n\nFor t terms:16t-8t =8t\n\nConstants: +16.\n\nSo total numerator: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Which matches. So the factoring is correct. Therefore, the simplification is correct, leading to x = t\u00b2-2t+4 =n -2\u221an +4.\n\nThus the previous analysis holds. So the correct answer is C, option C.\n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nThe minimal x is 28, so 25 is lower, so that's okay. The maximum is ~59 <64. So yes, all x are in C's interval.\n\nTherefore the correct answer is C. But let me look back at the options again to be sure. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm, but wait, the maximum is ~59.03. So D's upper limit is 60. Since 59.03 is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay, but the lower bound is 28 <x. Since x can be exactly 28, then the interval 28 <x <60 would exclude the case when x=28, which is possible. So D is incorrect. So the only option that fully contains the interval [28, ~59.03] is option C. Hence the correct answer is C.\n\nWait but the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Alternatively, maybe I should check if the expression for x is correct.\n\nWait, let me take a value of n between 36 and 72, say n=49 (so t=7). Then x would be 49 -2*7 +4 =49-14+4=39. Let's plug into the original equation to see if that's correct.\n\nOriginal numerator when n=49:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16 =49\u00b2 + 2*7*(49+4) +16.\n\nCompute each term:\n\n49\u00b2 is 2401.\n\n2*7*(53)=14*53=742.\n\nAdding 16 gives total numerator:2401 +742 +16 = 2401+742=3143 +16=3159.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4 =49 +4*7 +4 =49+28+4=81.\n\nSo x=3159 /81. Let's compute that: 81*39 = 3159. So yes, 3159/81=39. Which matches the simplified expression's result (39). So the simplification is correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=36. Then x=28 as before. Original calculation:\n\nNumerator:36\u00b2 +2*6*(36+4)+16 = 1296 + 2*6*40 +16 =1296 +480 +16=1792.\n\nDenominator:36 +4*6 +4 =36+24+4=64. 1792/64=28. Correct.\n\nAnother test case: n=72:\n\nNumerator:72\u00b2 +2*sqrt(72)*(72+4)+16. sqrt(72)=approx8.485.\n\n72\u00b2 is 5184. 2*8.485*(76) =2*8.485*76. Let's compute:\n\nFirst 8.485 *76: 8*76=608, 0.485*76\u224836.86. So total\u2248608+36.86=644.86. Multiply by 2: ~1289.72. Then adding 16 gives numerator\u22485184 +1289.72 +16\u22485184+1305.72\u22486489.72.\n\nDenominator:72 +4*sqrt(72)+4 =72+4*8.485+4 \u224872+33.94+4\u2248109.94.\n\nThen x\u22486489.72 /109.94 \u2248 let's see: 109.94 *59 \u22486481.46. Which is close to numerator 6489.72, so 59.03. Which matches the earlier calculation. So the simplification is correct.\n\nTherefore the answer must be option C. So the correct answer is C.\n\nWait but wait! Wait the options are written as:\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nBut the minimal x is 28. So 25 <x is okay because 28>25. The maximum is ~59.03 <64. So yes, all x are in C's interval. So answer C. But let me check if any of the other options could also include all x.\n\nOption D's interval is 28 <x <60. The minimal x is exactly 28, so it's excluded. So some x (like 28) is not in D's interval. So D is incorrect. Option B's upper limit is 58, which is under 59.03, so some x would be above 58. So B is out. A's upper is 54, which is too low. So the only possible answer is C. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\". So perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me see the options again. The question is from 36 \u2264n \u226472. The expression for x is (n squared + ...). Wait, but when n is 36, x is exactly 28. So the minimum value is 28. The maximum is ~59.03.\n\nLooking at the options, option C says 25 <x <64, which includes all possible x. So the correct answer must be C.\n\nWait but the initial thought was D, but D excludes the lower end. So I think the correct answer is C. Therefore, I should choose option C.\n\nWait, but wait! Wait, let me check the original question again. The problem says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\", so n can be 36, which gives x=28. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64. So 28 is within that interval, so it's okay.\n\nD)28 <x <60. 28 is excluded, so if the question requires the inequality to hold strictly (i.e., x must be less than 60 and greater than 28), but when n=36, x=28, so it's not greater than 28. Hence D is incorrect.\n\nThus the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\). Substituting \\( t \\) into the expression, we rewrite the numerator and denominator:\n\n**Numerator**:\n\\[\nn^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16 = t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16\n\\]\n\n**Denominator**:\n\\[\nn + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4 = t^2 + 4t + 4 = (t + 2)^2\n\\]\n\nFactoring the numerator:\n\\[\nt^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16 = (t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4)\n\\]\n\nDividing by the denominator \\((t + 2)^2\\) simplifies the expression to:\n\\[\nx = t^2 - 2t + 4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), we get:\n\\[\nx = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the range of \\( x \\) for \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\). Since \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), \\( t \\) ranges from \\( 6 \\) (when \\( n = 36 \\)) to \\( \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485 \\).\n\n**Evaluating the endpoints**:\n- When \\( n = 36 \\) (\\( t = 6 \\)):\n  \\[\n  x = 6^2 - 2(6) + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28\n  \\]\n- When \\( n = 72 \\) (\\( t \\approx 8.485 \\)):\n  \\[\n  x \\approx 72 - 2(8.485) + 4 = 76 - 16.97 \\approx 59.03\n  \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from **28** to approximately **59.03**. \n\n**Analyzing the options**:\n- **A) 20 < x < 54**: Upper bound too low (59.03 > 54).\n- **B) 23 < x < 58**: Upper bound too low (59.03 > 58).\n- **C) 25 < x < 64**: Includes all values (28 \u2264 x \u2264 59.03).\n- **D) 28 < x < 60**: Excludes the minimum value (x can be exactly 28).\n- **E) None of these**: Not needed since **C** is valid.\n\nThe correct interval is **C**, as it encompasses all possible values of \\( x \\).\n\nAnswer: C",
