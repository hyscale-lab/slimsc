      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. Hmm, so the problem is about finding the manufactured cost of each pen. Let's see. The company produces pens where 10% are defective and rejected before packing. They need to deliver 7200 pens to the wholesaler. Each pen is sold at Rs.10. The overall profit is 25%, so we need to find the cost per pen. \n\nWait, the profit is on the manufactured pens, right? Wait, the problem says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%.\" Hmm, so maybe the profit is calculated based on the total cost of manufacturing all the pens, including the defective ones? Because the 25% profit is on the manufactured pens. \n\nLet me think step by step. Let's denote variables. Let me suppose that the company needs to make enough pens so that after 10% are rejected, they have 7200 good ones left. Because they have to deliver 7200. So if 10% are defective, then the total number of pens they need to make is more than 7200. Let me calculate that first.\n\nLet\u2019s call the number of pens manufactured as M. Since 10% are defective, 90% are good. So 0.9*M = 7200. Solving for M gives M = 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens. So they have to make 8000 pens to end up with 7200 good ones.\n\nNow, the company sells 7200 pens at Rs.10 each. So total revenue is 7200 *10 = 72,000 Rs. \n\nThe profit is 25% on the total manufacturing cost. Wait, the problem says \"the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%.\" Hmm, maybe the total cost is the cost to manufacture all 8000 pens. Then the selling price gives them a 25% profit over that cost. \n\nSo, let me denote the total manufacturing cost as C. The selling price (revenue) is equal to C plus 25% of C. So revenue = C * 1.25. \n\nTherefore, C = Revenue / 1.25. \n\nRevenue is 72,000, so C would be 72,000 / 1.25. Let me compute that: 72,000 divided by 1.25. 72,000 divided by 5 is 14,400, so times 4 would be 57,600. Because 1.25 is 5/4, so dividing by 5/4 is multiplying by 4/5. So 72,000 *4/5 = 57,600. So total cost is 57,600. \n\nSo the total cost to manufacture 8000 pens is 57,600. Therefore, the cost per pen is 57,600 / 8000. Let me calculate that. \n\nDividing numerator and denominator by 100 gives 576 /80. 576 divided by 80. Let's see, 80*7 = 560, so 576-560=16. So 7.2. So 7.2? That would be option B. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me see again. \n\nThe problem says the profit is 25% on all the manufactured pens. So perhaps the profit is calculated on the cost. So profit is 25% of cost. So total revenue is cost + 25% of cost = 1.25*cost. So that part is correct. \n\nSo, total cost is 57,600. Therefore per pen cost is 57,600 divided by 8000 pens. 57,600 divided by 8000. Let me compute 57,600 /8000. \n\nWell, 8000 *7 =56,000. So subtract 56,000 from 57,600, gives 1,600. 1600 divided by 8000 is 0.2. So total is 7 + 0.2 =7.2. So Rs.7.2 per pen. So that would be option B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the total cost is based on the 8000 pens. Let me see if another approach works. \n\nSuppose the cost per pen is x. The total cost for making M pens (8000) would be 8000x. The revenue is 7200*10. The profit is 25% on the cost. So:\n\nRevenue = Cost + 25% of Cost = 1.25 * Cost\n\nSo 7200*10 = 1.25*(8000x)\n\nThen solving for x:\n\n72000 = 1.25*8000x\n\nCalculate 1.25 *8000 =10,000. Wait, 8000 *1.25 is 10,000?\n\nWait 8000 *1.25: 8000 + 8000*(0.25) =8000 +2000=10,000. Oh right! So 1.25*8000 is 10,000. \n\nSo equation: 72000 = 10000x \u2192 x =72000 /10000 =7.2. So yes, that's the same as before. \n\nSo the per pen cost is 7.2, so option B. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A)6, B)7.2, C)5.6, D)8, E)none. So B is there. So that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering profit per pen, but no, the problem says overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. So that would be on the total cost. \n\nAnother possible mistake: maybe the 25% profit is on the selling price? But that would be different. The question says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%.\" Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Profit is usually calculated as a percentage of cost, not selling price, unless specified. \n\nWait, let me think again. Profit percentage can sometimes be on cost price or on selling price. The question says \"profit on all the manufactured pens\". The phrase \"on all the manufactured pens\" might refer to the cost of manufacturing them. So the profit is 25% of the cost. So that would be correct as before. \n\nAlternatively, if it were 25% on the selling price, the calculation would be different, but the wording suggests it's on the cost. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B) 7.2.\n",

The company is delivering 7200 pens to the wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. The overall profit on all manufactured pens is 25%. Hmm, so I have to work backwards from the selling price and the profit to find the cost per pen.\n\nWait, first, since 10% are defective, the company must have produced more than 7200 pens. Because out of the total produced, 10% are rejected, so 90% are good and can be delivered. Let me think. Let\u2019s denote the total number of pens manufactured as N. Then 90% of N must equal 7200, right? Because those are the ones that are not defective and can be delivered. So N * 0.9 = 7200. Therefore, N = 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens. So the company has to make 8000 pens in total to end up with 7200 good ones.\n\nNow, the company sells 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each. The total revenue would be 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000. \n\nThe problem states the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. Wait, profit percentage is usually calculated on cost, right? Or is it on the selling price? The question says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". Hmm, I need to clarify this. \n\nWait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. The profit is 25% on the manufactured cost? Or on the selling price? The question says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens\". Maybe it's profit on cost. Let me check standard profit calculations. Profit percentage is typically calculated as (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. So if the profit is 25%, then selling price would be cost plus 25% of cost. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total revenue minus total cost gives profit, which is 25% of the total cost. Because the question says the profit is 25% of the cost. Let me see. Let me define variables properly.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet C be the manufactured cost per pen. So total cost for producing N pens (which is 8000 pens) would be 8000 * C.\n\nThe total revenue is 7200 * 10 = 72,000.\n\nThe profit is 25% of the total cost. So Profit = 0.25 * (Total Cost).\n\nWe know that Profit = Revenue - Cost.\n\nTherefore, Revenue - Cost = 0.25 * Cost.\n\nSo, Revenue = 1.25 * Cost.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers.\n\nRevenue (72000) = 1.25 * (Total Cost) \n\nTotal Cost is 8000 * C. So,\n\n72000 = 1.25 * (8000 * C)\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n1.25 * 8000 = 10,000. Wait, 8000*1.25 is 10,000? Let me calculate 8000 * 1 = 8000, 8000*0.25 is 2000, so total 10,000. Yes. \n\nSo 72000 = 10000 * C \u2192 C = 72000 / 10000 = 7.2. \n\nWait, so that would make the cost per pen Rs. 7.2. But that can't be right because the selling price is Rs.10 each. Then the cost would be 7.2, so the profit per pen would be 2.8, but considering that 10% are defective, maybe the calculation is different?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the total cost is 8000*C. The revenue is 72000. So according to the equation, 72000 = 1.25*(8000*C). Let me recheck the steps. \n\nYes, the profit is 25% on the total cost. So revenue is cost plus 25% of cost, so 1.25 times cost. \n\nSo solving for C gives 72000 divided by (1.25 *8000). Let me compute denominator first: 1.25 *8000 = 10,000. So 72000 /10000 is 7.2. So that would be option B. \n\nWait, but the options have B as 7.2. But let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating. Suppose that the profit is 25% on the selling price. Let me see what the question says. It says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". The wording is a bit unclear. Maybe the profit is 25% of the selling price? Let me try that approach. \n\nIf profit is 25% of the selling price, then total profit would be 0.25 * total revenue. Then, total cost would be total revenue minus profit, so 72000 - (0.25*72000) = 0.75 *72000 = 54000. Then total cost is 54000. Then cost per pen is 54000 divided by 8000 pens. 54000/8000 = 6.75, which is not an option here. Since the options don't have that, so probably the first approach is correct. \n\nThe question says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". The term \"on all the manufactured pens\" might mean that the profit is 25% of the cost. Because the profit is made on the cost. So the first calculation is correct. So the answer would be B) 7.2. \n\nWait, but if the cost is 7.2 per pen, then each pen sold would have a selling price of 10, so the profit per pen sold is 2.8. But since 10% are defective, the company produces 8000 pens. The total cost is 8000 *7.2 = 57,600. The revenue is 72,000. Profit is 72000-57600=14400. Then the profit percentage is (14400 /57600)*100 = 25%, which matches. So that checks out. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 7.2. But let me check the options again. Option B is 7.2, so that's the answer. Wait, but another thought: the question says \"manufactured cost of each pen\". So each pen that is manufactured, even the defective ones, contribute to the cost. So the total cost is 8000 * C. The revenue is from 7200 pens. So the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, so I think B is the correct answer. Let me see the options again. The options given are A)6, B)7.2, C)5.6, D)8, E)None. Since B is an option, then the answer is B. So I think the answer is B.\n",

So revenue is cost plus 25% of cost, so 1.25 times cost. \n\nSo solving for C gives 72000 divided by (1.25 *8000). Let me compute denominator first: 1.25 *8000 = 10,000. So 72000 /10000 is 7.2. So that would be option B. \n\nWait, but the options have B as 7.2. But let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm miscalculating. Suppose that the profit is 25% on the selling price. Let me see what the question says. It says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". The wording is a bit unclear. Maybe the profit is 25% of the selling price? Let me try that approach. \n\nIf profit is 25% of the selling price, then total profit would be 0.25 * total revenue. Then, total cost would be total revenue minus profit, so 72000 - (0.25*72000) = 0.75 *72000 = 54000. Then total cost is 54000. Then cost per pen is 54000 divided by 8000 pens. 54000/8000 = 6.75, which is not an option here. Since the options don't have that, so probably the first approach is correct. \n\nThe question says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". The term \"on all the manufactured pens\" might mean that the profit is 25% of the cost. Because the profit is made on the cost. So the first calculation is correct. So the answer would be B) 7.2. \n\nWait, but if the cost is 7.2 per pen, then each pen sold would have a selling price of 10, so the profit per pen sold is 2.8. But since 10% are defective, the company produces 8000 pens. The total cost is 8000 *7.2 = 57,600. The revenue is 72,000. Profit is 72000-57600=14400. Then the profit percentage is (14400 /57600)*100 = 25%, which matches. So that checks out. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B) 7.2. But let me check the options again. Option B is 7.2, so that's the answer. Wait, but another thought: the question says \"manufactured cost of each pen\". So each pen that is manufactured, even the defective ones, contribute to the cost. So the total cost is 8000 * C. The revenue is from 7200 pens. So the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, so I think B is the correct answer. Let me see the options again. The options given are A)6, B)7.2, C)5.6, D)8, E)None. Since B is an option, then the answer is B. So I think the answer is B.\n\n\nTo determine the manufactured cost per pen, we start by noting that 10% of the produced pens are defective. Let \\( N \\) be the total number of pens manufactured. Since 90% of these pens are non-defective and must equal 7200, we have:\n\n\\[\n0.9N = 7200 \\implies N = \\frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000 \\text{ pens}\n\\]\n\nThe total revenue from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = 7200 \\times 10 = \\text{Rs. } 72,\\!000\n\\]\n\nThe company's profit is 25% of the total manufacturing cost. Let \\( C \\) be the cost per pen. The total manufacturing cost for 8000 pens is \\( 8000C \\). The profit equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Revenue} = \\text{Cost} + 0.25 \\times \\text{Cost} \\implies \\text{Revenue} = 1.25 \\times \\text{Cost}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\n72,\\!000 = 1.25 \\times (8000C)\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\n72,\\!000 = 10,\\!000C \\implies C = \\frac{72,\\!000}{10,\\!000} = 7.2\n\\]\n\nThis matches option B. Verifying, the total cost is \\( 8000 \\times 7.2 = 57,\\!600 \\), and the profit \\( 72,\\!000 - 57,\\!600 = 14,\\!400 \\) is indeed 25% of \\( 57,\\!600 \\).\n\nAnswer: B",
