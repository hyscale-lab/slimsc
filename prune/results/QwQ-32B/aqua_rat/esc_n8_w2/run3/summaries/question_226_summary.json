      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. Peter wants to form a scavenger hunt team with 10 additional people, so that makes the team size 11 including himself? Wait, the question says \"10 additional people\" so total team would be Peter plus 10 friends, so total of 11. But the problem states he has 10 friends who want to participate. Wait, hold on. The wording is a bit tricky here. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"Peter wants to find 10 additional people to form a scavenger hunt team with him. If he has 10 friends who would like to participate, how many choices does he have for forming his team?\"\n\nHmm. So Peter is looking for 10 more people to join him. The total team would be 11 people (Peter plus 10). But he has exactly 10 friends available. Wait, so does that mean he has to choose all of his 10 friends, because there's no one else? Because if he needs 10 people and he only has 10 friends, then he can't choose anyone else. So the only possible team is all his 10 friends plus himself. But then the question is, how many choices does he have for forming the team. If all his friends are willing to participate, then he can't choose a subset, he has to take all of them. Because he needs exactly 10 friends. Wait, but maybe there's a different way to look at it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased such that Peter has 10 friends, but he needs to pick 10 of them? Wait, no. Wait, if he has exactly 10 friends, and he needs to choose 10, then the number of ways is 1. Because there's only one way to choose all 10 when you have exactly that many. So the answer would be B)1. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not missing anything here. Let me think again. The problem says Peter wants to form a team with 10 additional people. So the team is Peter plus 10 others. But his available friends are 10. So he must choose all of them. Since all 10 friends are willing, so the only possible team is those 10 plus him. Therefore there's only one possible team, so the number of choices is 1. So the answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here. Like, perhaps the question is considering whether Peter can choose not to include someone, but then the team would have less than 10? But the problem states he wants to find 10 additional people. So he needs exactly 10. Since there are exactly 10 friends available, he must pick all of them. Therefore the number of combinations is 10 choose 10, which is 1. So the correct answer must be B. The options are A)0, B)1, etc. So yeah, B is the answer.\n",
