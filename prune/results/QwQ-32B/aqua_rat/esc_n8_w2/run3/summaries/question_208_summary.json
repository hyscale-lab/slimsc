      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this quadratic equation problem here. The question is asking for the largest integral value of k where the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 has two real and distinct roots. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, right. I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx +c =0 to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So I need to calculate that and set it greater than zero.\n\nLet me write that down. The equation given is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Here, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. The discriminant D would be (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*(k). So that's 25 -4k. For two real and distinct roots, D must be greater than 0. So 25 -4k >0. \n\nSolving that inequality: 25 -4k >0 \u2192 -4k > -25. When I divide both sides by -4, I have to reverse the inequality sign because dividing by a negative number flips the inequality. So k < 25/4. Let me calculate 25 divided by 4. 25 divided by 4 is 6.25. So k must be less than 6.25. \n\nThe question asks for the largest integer value of k that satisfies this. Since 6.25 is the upper limit, the largest integer less than that is 6. Wait, but looking at the options, 6 isn't there. The options given are 9,7,3,8,12. Wait, that's confusing. None of the options are 6. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the discriminant. Let me recalculate. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, b is -5, so squared is 25. Then 4ac is 4*1*k, so 4k. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192k <25/4, which is indeed 6.25. So the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6, but 6 is not an option here. The options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Wait, that can't be right. None of the options except maybe C)3 is below 6.25. But then the question must be a trick question? Or did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. So the quadratic is correct. The discriminant calculation is correct. So the maximum integer k is 6, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is phrased differently? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality. Let me see:\n\nWait, discriminant must be positive, so 25-4k >0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. So if the options don't have that, then maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Wait but looking at the options again: A is 9, which is way higher. B is7, which is over 6.25, so that would not satisfy the condition. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe I have the discriminant formula wrong. Let me confirm. The discriminant for ax\u00b2+bx+c is b\u00b2-4ac. So in this case, yes, (-5)^2 is 25, minus 4*1*k. So that's correct. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the largest integer where the roots are integers? But the question says \"two real and distinct roots,\" which doesn't require integer roots. So that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's coefficients. Let me check again. The equation is x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero. So coefficients a=1, b=-5, c=k. So discriminant is indeed 25-4k. \n\nHmm. So the problem must have an error? But that can't be. Maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, perhaps the question is phrased as \"integral value of k\" but the options given are A through E, which include numbers higher than 6.25. So the possible options must include a number less than 6.25. Wait, the options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. The only one less than 6.25 is C)3, but that's way smaller. So maybe the question is asking for the largest possible k such that the equation has real roots, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the discriminant. Let me recalculate. Let me write the discriminant again. D = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25 -4k. Yes, that's right. So D>0 \u2192 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192k <6.25. So the maximum integer is 6, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is different? Wait, maybe the question is about the quadratic having real roots, but maybe the user made a typo in the options? But the user says the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I have a miscalculation here. Let me check again:\n\nWait, maybe the quadratic is x\u00b2 +5x +k? No, the question says x2 -5x +k. So no. Alternatively, maybe I confused the sign in the discriminant. Let me see. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k. So the discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. Here, a is positive 1, b is -5, so squared is positive 25. c is k. So 25-4k. Correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question is asking for the largest k such that the roots are integers? Then perhaps the answer would be different, but the question says \"two real and distinct roots,\" which doesn't require integer roots. \n\nWait, maybe the user made a mistake in the options. Because according to my calculation, the correct answer should be 6, which isn't listed here. The options given are 9,7,3,8,12. All of those except 3 are higher than 6.25. So none of them satisfy the condition except 3? But then 3 is the only one less than 6.25. But that would make C) the answer, but that's the smallest option. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k. So the maximum possible k is just under 6.25, so 6. So 6 is the answer, but it's not an option. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant formula. Let me check again. Wait, discriminant for ax\u00b2+bx +c is b\u00b2-4ac. So in this case, a is 1, so 4ac is 4*1*k. So yes. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is written differently. Let me check again. The question says \"the quadratic equation x2 -5x +k =0 will have two real and distinct roots\". So the equation is correct. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again: options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh wait a second! Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 25 divided by 4. Let me compute 25 divided by 4. 4 times 6 is 24, so 25/4 is 6.25. That's correct. So k must be less than 6.25, so the largest integer is 6, but none of the options except C (3) is less than 6.25. Wait, but 7 is 7, which is higher than 6.25, so that would not work. So none of the options except 3 would work, but that's the smallest. \n\nWait, this can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign of the discriminant? Let me think again. The equation has two real and distinct roots when discriminant is positive. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly? Or maybe I misread the equation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0? If so, then b would be +5, so discriminant would be 25-4k, same as before. Wait, no, the equation given is x squared minus 5x plus k. \n\nHmm. This is confusing. The options given don't include 6, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the smallest k? But no, it says largest. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant's inequality. Let me see. If the discriminant is positive, then yes. But maybe I mixed up the inequality direction. Let me see: 25-4k>0 \u2192 -4k> -25 \u2192 when you divide by -4, you flip the inequality, so k < 25/4. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the quadratic having two real roots, but the user wrote \"integral value of k\", but perhaps it's supposed to be the largest value of k where the roots are integers? Let me see. Let's try that approach. \n\nIf the roots are integers, then the quadratic factors into (x - m)(x -n) = x\u00b2 - (m+n)x + mn. Comparing to x\u00b2 -5x +k, so m + n =5 and mn =k. So the roots must be integers adding to 5, and their product is k. To maximize k, we need the product to be as large as possible. The pairs of integers that add to 5 are (0,5) product 0, (1,4) product4, (2,3) product6, ( -1,6) product-6, etc. The maximum product here is 6. So that would be 2 and 3. So k=6. Again, but 6 isn't an option. \n\nHmm. But again, the question says \"two real and distinct roots\", not necessarily integer roots. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in the equation x squared minus 5x minus k equals zero? Then the discriminant would be 25 +4k. Then discriminant would be positive for any k >=0, so that's not it. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's coefficients. Let me check again. The problem says x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So coefficients are correct. \n\nWait, the options given include 8 (option D) and 7 (B), which are higher than 6.25. If those were the answers, then the discriminant would be negative. For example, if k=8, discriminant is 25 -32= -7, which is negative, so no real roots. So that can't be. \n\nHmm. The only possible option that would satisfy the condition is C)3. Because 3 is less than 6.25. But that's the smallest option. But the question asks for the largest. So if all the other options are invalid, the answer must be C)3? But that seems odd. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question. Let me check again. The question says \"the largest integral value of 'k'\". So the maximum integer k where the equation has two real roots. Since the maximum possible k is 6.25, the largest integer less than that is 6. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question has a typo? Like maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0? Let's see. \n\nIf the equation were x\u00b2 -5x -k =0, then discriminant would be 25 +4k. Then for real roots, discriminant must be positive. 25 +4k>0 \u2192 k> -25/4. Since k can be any integer greater than -6.25, but the question is asking for the largest k, which would be unbounded, which doesn't make sense. So that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then discriminant would be 25-4k. Same as before. So same problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero, but the question is looking for the smallest k? But no, the question says largest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the quadratic can have real roots even when k is higher? Wait no, because when k exceeds 6.25, discriminant becomes negative, so no real roots. \n\nHmm. Maybe the options given are incorrect. But since I have to choose from them, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated 25 divided by 4? Let me check: 4 times 6 is 24, so 25/4 is 6.25. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants the smallest possible k? Then the answer would be the lowest, but that's not what it says. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I have a sign error in the discriminant. Let me re-derive. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So (-5)^2 is 25, minus 4*1*k. So yes. \n\nHmm. The options given don't include 6, so perhaps the question is different. Wait, maybe the quadratic is supposed to have two positive real roots? That would add constraints. Let me think. \n\nIf the roots are positive, then sum is positive (since -b/a =5>0) and product is positive (c/a =k>0). But even then, the discriminant must be positive. So the maximum k is still 6.25. So again, 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the largest integer k where the equation has two distinct real roots, but perhaps including when discriminant is zero? Wait, no. Two distinct roots requires discriminant positive. \n\nHmm. Since the problem's options don't have 6, perhaps the correct answer here is the closest lower integer which is 6, but since it's not an option, perhaps there is an error. But given the options, the largest possible k that is less than 6.25 is 6, but since that's not present, maybe the next lower is 5, which also not present. The options given are 9,7,3,8,12. None of these are less than 6.25 except 3. So 3 is the only possible one. But that's the smallest option. The question asks for the largest. So that can't be right. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign of the discriminant. Suppose the quadratic equation was x\u00b2 +5x +k =0, then discriminant is 25-4k. The same as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x squared minus (5x +k)=0? But that's same as x\u00b2-5x -k =0. Then discriminant is 25 +4k. Which would be positive for any k greater than -6.25. But then, the maximum k would be unbounded. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and the equation is x squared minus 5x minus k equals zero, so then discriminant is 25 +4k. Then discriminant must be positive, so 25+4k>0 \u2192k> -6.25. But then the question asks for the largest integer k, which would be infinity, so that's not possible. \n\nHmm. I'm really confused here. The only possible way that the options given can be correct is if I made a mistake in the discriminant. Wait, let me check once again. \n\nThe quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. \n\nDiscriminant D = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25-4k. \n\nFor two real distinct roots: D>0 \u219225-4k>0 \u21924k<25 \u2192k <6.25. \n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But since it's not an option, maybe the problem is written incorrectly? Like maybe the coefficient of x is positive 5? Let me see. If the equation was x\u00b2+5x +k =0, then discriminant is still 25-4k. Same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the quadratic is 2x\u00b2 -5x +k =0? Then a is 2. Let me see. Then discriminant would be 25 -8k. Then D>0 \u219225-8k>0 \u21928k <25 \u2192k <3.125. So the maximum integer is 3. Which is option C. But that's not the equation given. The equation is x squared, so a=1. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question is asking for the smallest possible k? Then 3 would be the answer, but that's not the question. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question says \"real and equal roots\" instead of \"real and distinct\"? If it were equal roots, discriminant must be zero. Then 25-4k=0 \u2192k=6.25. So the closest integer would be 6, but again not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I have to choose the highest possible k from the options that still makes the discriminant non-negative. Wait, that's possible. Let's check each option's k value and see which is the highest where discriminant is still positive. \n\nLet me check each option:\n\nA)9: k=9 \u2192 discriminant is 25 -4*9 =25-36= -11 <0 \u2192 no real roots. So invalid. \n\nB)7: 25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no. \n\nC)3: 25-12=13>0 \u2192 yes. \n\nD)8: 25-32= -7 <0 \u2192 no. \n\nE)12: 25-48= -23 <0 \u2192 no. \n\nSo among the options, only option C (3) gives a discriminant that's positive. So that would be the only valid one. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k where the equation has two real and distinct roots. Since 3 is the only one that works, then that must be the answer. But that's counterintuitive because it's the smallest option. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick question where the options are all wrong except 3? Then the answer is C. But the problem is, the question says \"largest integral value of k\", so even if all options except 3 are invalid, 3 is the only possible answer. \n\nHmm. Maybe that's the case. The options given must have C as the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again for option C: k=3. \n\nDiscriminant is 25-12=13>0. So yes, two real roots. \n\nFor k=6 (not an option), discriminant is 25-24=1>0. So that's valid. But since it's not an option, the highest possible among the options is 3. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be C)3. But that feels odd, but given the options provided, it's the only valid one. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"largest integral value of k\". So if 3 is the only valid option, then yes. But maybe I made a mistake in the problem's equation. Let me check once again. The equation is x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero. So coefficients are correct. \n\nHmm. So I think the answer must be option C. But the options given don't have the correct 6, so the only possible answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's question. Like maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0? Then same discriminant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is x squared plus 5x minus k equals zero? Let's see: then discriminant would be 25 +4k. To have real roots, that's always possible for any k >=-25/4. So the maximum k would be infinity, which isn't the case. \n\nHmm. I think the problem must have a typo, but given the options, the only possible correct answer is C)3. So I'll go with that. \n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this quadratic equation problem here. The question is asking for the largest integral value of k where the equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 has two real and distinct roots. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Hmm, right. I remember that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx +c =0 to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So I need to calculate that and set it greater than zero.\n\nLet me write that down. The equation given is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Here, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k.

Let me check again: options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. Oh wait a second! Wait, perhaps I miscalculated 25 divided by 4. Let me compute 25 divided by 4. 4 times 6 is 24, so 25/4 is 6.25. That's correct. So k must be less than 6.25, so the largest integer is 6, but none of the options except C (3) is less than 6.25. Wait, but 7 is 7, which is higher than 6.25, so that would not work. So none of the options except 3 would work, but that's the smallest. \n\nWait, this can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign of the discriminant? Let me think again. The equation has two real and distinct roots when discriminant is positive. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly? Or maybe I misread the equation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0? If so, then b would be +5, so discriminant would be 25-4k, same as before. Wait, no, the equation given is x squared minus 5x plus k. \n\nHmm. This is confusing. The options given don't include 6, so perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the smallest k? But no, it says largest. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the discriminant's inequality. Let me see. If the discriminant is positive, then yes. But maybe I mixed up the inequality direction. Let me see: 25-4k>0 \u2192 -4k> -25 \u2192 when you divide by -4, you flip the inequality, so k < 25/4. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is about the quadratic having two real roots, but the user wrote \"integral value of k\", but perhaps it's supposed to be the largest value of k where the roots are integers? Let me see. Let's try that approach. \n\nIf the roots are integers, then the quadratic factors into (x - m)(x -n) = x\u00b2 - (m+n)x + mn. Comparing to x\u00b2 -5x +k, so m + n =5 and mn =k. So the roots must be integers adding to 5, and their product is k. To maximize k, we need the product to be as large as possible. The pairs of integers that add to 5 are (0,5) product 0, (1,4) product4, (2,3) product6, ( -1,6) product-6, etc. The maximum product here is 6. So that would be 2 and 3. So k=6. Again, but 6 isn't an option. \n\nHmm. But again, the question says \"two real and distinct roots\", not necessarily integer roots. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in the equation x squared minus 5x minus k equals zero? Then the discriminant would be 25 +4k. Then discriminant would be positive for any k >=0, so that's not it. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's coefficients. Let me check again. The problem says x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So coefficients are correct. \n\nWait, the options given include 8 (option D) and 7 (B), which are higher than 6.25. If those were the answers, then the discriminant would be negative. For example, if k=8, discriminant is 25 -32= -7, which is negative, so no real roots. So that can't be. \n\nHmm. The only possible option that would satisfy the condition is C)3. Because 3 is less than 6.25. But that's the smallest option. But the question asks for the largest. So if all the other options are invalid, the answer must be C)3? But that seems odd. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question. Let me check again. The question says \"the largest integral value of 'k'\". So the maximum integer k where the equation has two real roots. Since the maximum possible k is 6.25, the largest integer less than that is 6. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question has a typo? Like maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0? Let's see. \n\nIf the equation were x\u00b2 -5x -k =0, then discriminant would be 25 +4k. Then for real roots, discriminant must be positive. 25 +4k>0 \u2192 k> -25/4. Since k can be any integer greater than -6.25, but the question is asking for the largest k, which would be unbounded, which doesn't make sense. So that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then discriminant would be 25-4k. Same as before. So same problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero, but the question is looking for the smallest k? But no, the question says largest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to consider that the quadratic can have real roots even when k is higher? Wait no, because when k exceeds 6.25, discriminant becomes negative, so no real roots. \n\nHmm. Maybe the options given are incorrect. But since I have to choose from them, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated 25 divided by 4? Let me check: 4 times 6 is 24, so 25/4 is 6.25. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants the smallest possible k? Then the answer would be the lowest, but that's not what it says. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I have a sign error in the discriminant. Let me re-derive. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So (-5)^2 is 25, minus 4*1*k. So yes. \n\nHmm. The options given don't include 6, so perhaps the question is different. Wait, maybe the quadratic is supposed to have two positive real roots? That would add constraints. Let me think. \n\nIf the roots are positive, then sum is positive (since -b/a =5>0) and product is positive (c/a =k>0). But even then, the discriminant must be positive. So the maximum k is still 6.25. So again, 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the largest integer k where the equation has two distinct real roots, but perhaps including when discriminant is zero? Wait, no. Two distinct roots requires discriminant positive. \n\nHmm. Since the problem's options don't have 6, perhaps the correct answer here is the closest lower integer which is 6, but since it's not an option, perhaps there is an error. But given the options, the largest possible k that is less than 6.25 is 6, but since that's not present, maybe the next lower is 5, which also not present. The options given are 9,7,3,8,12. None of these are less than 6.25 except 3. So 3 is the only possible one. But that's the smallest option. The question asks for the largest. So that can't be right. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign of the discriminant. Suppose the quadratic equation was x\u00b2 +5x +k =0, then discriminant is 25-4k. The same as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x squared minus (5x +k)=0? But that's same as x\u00b2-5x -k =0. Then discriminant is 25 +4k. Which would be positive for any k greater than -6.25. But then, the maximum k would be unbounded. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a typo and the equation is x squared minus 5x minus k equals zero, so then discriminant is 25 +4k. Then discriminant must be positive, so 25+4k>0 \u2192k> -6.25. But then the question asks for the largest integer k, which would be infinity, so that's not possible. \n\nHmm. I'm really confused here. The only possible way that the options given can be correct is if I made a mistake in the discriminant. Wait, let me check once again. \n\nThe quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. \n\nDiscriminant D = (-5)^2 -4*(1)*(k) =25-4k. \n\nFor two real distinct roots: D>0 \u219225-4k>0 \u21924k<25 \u2192k <6.25. \n\nSo the maximum integer k is 6. But since it's not an option, maybe the problem is written incorrectly? Like maybe the coefficient of x is positive 5? Let me see. If the equation was x\u00b2+5x +k =0, then discriminant is still 25-4k. Same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the quadratic is 2x\u00b2 -5x +k =0? Then a is 2. Let me see. Then discriminant would be 25 -8k. Then D>0 \u219225-8k>0 \u21928k <25 \u2192k <3.125. So the maximum integer is 3. Which is option C. But that's not the equation given. The equation is x squared, so a=1. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question is asking for the smallest possible k? Then 3 would be the answer, but that's not the question. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question says \"real and equal roots\" instead of \"real and distinct\"? If it were equal roots, discriminant must be zero. Then 25-4k=0 \u2192k=6.25. So the closest integer would be 6, but again not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I have to choose the highest possible k from the options that still makes the discriminant non-negative. Wait, that's possible. Let's check each option's k value and see which is the highest where discriminant is still positive. \n\nLet me check each option:\n\nA)9: k=9 \u2192 discriminant is 25 -4*9 =25-36= -11 <0 \u2192 no real roots. So invalid. \n\nB)7: 25-28= -3 <0 \u2192 no. \n\nC)3: 25-12=13>0 \u2192 yes. \n\nD)8: 25-32= -7 <0 \u2192 no. \n\nE)12: 25-48= -23 <0 \u2192 no. \n\nSo among the options, only option C (3) gives a discriminant that's positive. So that would be the only valid one. But the question asks for the largest integral value of k where the equation has two real and distinct roots. Since 3 is the only one that works, then that must be the answer. But that's counterintuitive because it's the smallest option. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick question where the options are all wrong except 3? Then the answer is C. But the problem is, the question says \"largest integral value of k\", so even if all options except 3 are invalid, 3 is the only possible answer. \n\nHmm. Maybe that's the case. The options given must have C as the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again for option C: k=3. \n\nDiscriminant is 25-12=13>0. So yes, two real roots. \n\nFor k=6 (not an option), discriminant is 25-24=1>0. So that's valid. But since it's not an option, the highest possible among the options is 3. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be C)3. But that feels odd, but given the options provided, it's the only valid one. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"largest integral value of k\". So if 3 is the only valid option, then yes. But maybe I made a mistake in the problem's equation. Let me check once again. The equation is x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero. So coefficients are correct. \n\nHmm. So I think the answer must be option C. But the options given don't have the correct 6, so the only possible answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's question. Like maybe the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0? Then same discriminant. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is x squared plus 5x minus k equals zero? Let's see: then discriminant would be 25 +4k. To have real roots, that's always possible for any k >=-25/4. So the maximum k would be infinity, which isn't the case. \n\nHmm. I think the problem must have a typo, but given the options, the only possible correct answer is C)3. So I'll go with that. \n\n\nThe quadratic equation \\(x^2 - 5x + k = 0\\) has two real and distinct roots if its discriminant is positive. The discriminant \\(D\\) is calculated as:\n\n\\[\nD = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k\n\\]\n\nFor two real and distinct roots, \\(D > 0\\):\n\n\\[\n25 - 4k > 0 \\implies 4k < 25 \\implies k < \\frac{25}{4} = 6.25\n\\]\n\nThe largest integer less than 6.25 is 6, but this value is not among the options. Evaluating the given options:\n\n- **A) 9**: \\(25 - 4(9) = -11\\) (negative, no real roots)\n- **B) 7**: \\(25 - 4(7) = -3\\) (negative, no real roots)\n- **C) 3**: \\(25 - 4(3) = 13\\) (positive, valid)\n- **D) 8**: \\(25 - 4(8) = -7\\) (negative, no real roots)\n- **E) 12**: \\(25 - 4(12) = -23\\) (negative, no real roots)\n\nOnly **C) 3** results in a positive discriminant. Since this is the only valid option and the question asks for the largest integral value, **C) 3** is the correct choice despite being smaller than 6.25 due to the constraints of the provided options.\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the largest integer value of k for which the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, right. Let me remember how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0 to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So in this case, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Here, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. \n\nCalculating the discriminant: D = (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*(k). That simplifies to 25 -4k. For two real and distinct roots, D has to be greater than 0. So 25 -4k >0. Let me solve that inequality.\n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 -4k > -25. When I divide both sides by -4, I have to reverse the inequality sign because dividing by a negative number flips the inequality. So k < 25/4. Let me compute 25 divided by 4. That's 6.25. \n\nSo k must be less than 6.25. Since the question asks for the largest integer value of k, the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options given, the choices are 9,7,3,8,12. Wait a second, none of the options have 6. That's odd. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nLet me check again. Maybe I messed up the discriminant. Let me recalculate. The discriminant is b squared minus 4ac. So b is -5, so (-5)^2 is 25. Then 4ac is 4*1*k, so 4k. So discriminant is 25-4k. So yes, that's correct. So discriminant must be greater than zero, so 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6, but the options don't have that. Hmm. Wait, looking back at the options: A is 9, B is7, C is3, D is8, E is12. None of these are 6. So maybe I made an error in the problem setup?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. The question is the largest integral value of k where there are two real and distinct roots. So according to my calculation, k has to be less than 6.25. The largest integer below that is 6, but 6 isn't an option. The options given are up to 12. So maybe there's a mistake in my approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check if the question is about real roots, but maybe the user made a typo or I misread the coefficients? Let me confirm the equation again. The equation is x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero. Yes. So coefficients are correct.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Wait, maybe I messed up the inequality direction? Let me go through the steps again. \n\nThe discriminant D =25 -4k must be >0. So 25 -4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 25/4 >k. 25/4 is 6.25. So yes, k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer possible is 6. Since the options given are up to 12, but 6 isn't listed, perhaps the options are wrong? Or maybe I misunderstood the question?\n\nWait, the options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None of these are 6.25 or below. Wait, so that suggests that perhaps I made an error in the discriminant. Maybe I have the sign wrong?\n\nWait, discriminant for ax\u00b2 +bx +c is b\u00b2-4ac. Here, a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So substituting, (-5)^2 is 25, minus 4*1*k. So 25-4k. That's correct. So D must be positive. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25. \n\nHmm, but the options given are higher. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the largest integer where the roots are real and distinct, but maybe I need to check if there's a different interpretation. Like, maybe the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but maybe the user meant something else? Like perhaps the equation is x squared plus 5x plus k? Wait no, the question says x2 -5x +k. Oh, maybe I made a mistake in the sign of the discriminant?\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, so when the equation is written in standard form, the coefficients are correct. So the discriminant is indeed 25-4k. So the discriminant must be positive, so 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or maybe I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the roots being real and equal, but no, it says real and distinct. Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the smallest k? But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality. Let me see again:\n\n25-4k >0 \u2192 subtract 25 from both sides: -4k > -25 \u2192 multiply both sides by (-1) which flips the inequality: 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. That's correct. So the maximum integer is 6, but that's not an option here. The options given are up to 12. So this is a problem. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says \"largest integral value of k\". The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None of these are less than 6.25 except 3 and maybe 7? Wait 7 is higher than 6.25. Wait, 6.25 is 6 and a quarter. So 7 is higher than that, so 7 would make the discriminant negative. Let me test k=7.\n\nIf k is 7: discriminant would be 25 -4*7 =25-28= -3, which is negative. So the roots would be complex. So 7 is not acceptable. Similarly for 8, 9, 12. So those would all give discriminant negative. Only 3 is less than 6.25. So 3 would be the only one that works. But the options have 3 as option C. But the question is asking for the largest possible k. So 6.25, the largest integer less than that is 6. So since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the problem is written wrong?\n\nWait, maybe the equation is different? Like maybe x\u00b2 +5x +k=0? Let me check. Suppose the equation was x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then discriminant would be 25-4k. So same as before. Wait, no, that would be same. Wait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0? Then the discriminant would be 25 +4k. Then discriminant must be positive, so 25+4k>0, but that would allow higher k. But that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is x squared plus 5x plus k? No, the question says minus 5x. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a mistake in the problem options. Because according to my calculations, the maximum integer k is 6, which isn't listed here. The options given have 3 as the only possible valid one. But the question is asking for the largest. So perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I messed up the discriminant formula. Let me recalculate for each of the options given. Let's check each option's k value and see which is the largest possible where discriminant is positive.\n\nOption A: k=9. Discriminant is 25 -4*9 =25-36= -11 \u2192 negative. So roots not real. So invalid.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. So invalid.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 25-12=13 \u2192 positive. So that's okay. \n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 25-32= -7 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 25-48= -23 \u2192 negative.\n\nSo among all the options given, only k=3 gives a positive discriminant. Therefore, the answer would be C)3. But wait, the question asks for the largest possible k. But 3 is the only valid one here. So maybe the options are wrong, but given the choices, 3 is the only correct one. But the question must have an answer here, so maybe I made an error in the discriminant?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was meant to have the equation x\u00b2 +5x +k =0? Let me check. If that's the case, then discriminant is 25-4k. Wait, same as before. Wait no, that's still the same. Wait, no. Wait, in that case, equation would be x\u00b2 +5x +k, so a=1, b=5, c=k. So discriminant is 25-4k. So same calculation. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0. Then discriminant would be 25 +4k. Then discriminant positive requires 25 +4k>0 \u2192 which is always true for positive k. But then the question would be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x = k, but that's not the same as x\u00b2-5x +k=0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not about real and distinct roots but something else? But the question clearly states two real and distinct roots. \n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-express the discriminant. For two real and distinct roots, discriminant D must be greater than zero. So D>0 \u219225-4k>0 \u2192k <6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the options provided are incorrect? But the user says the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. \n\nWait, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check each option again:\n\nk=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive. So that's okay. \n\nk=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 nope. \n\nk=8 \u2192 25-32= -7 \u2192 nope. \n\nSo the only valid options are 3. So if the question is asking for the largest possible k among the given options where the equation has real roots, then 3 is the answer. But the question says \"largest integral value of k\", not the largest among the options. Wait, but the options given are the possible answers. So perhaps the question is from a source where maybe there was a typo, but given the options, the correct answer is 3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the equation's coefficients. Let me check once more. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Discriminant is (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) \u219225-4k. That's correct. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. The problem must have the options as given, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. \n\nWait, maybe the question is actually asking for the smallest k? But that would be 3. But the question says largest. Alternatively, maybe I misread the equation as x squared plus 5x? Let me check again. The user wrote \"x2 -5x +k =0\". So it's x squared minus 5x plus k. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is written as x squared - 5x + k \u22640? No, that's not the case. \n\nHmm. Given the options provided, the only possible answer is C)3. Because all the other options would result in a negative discriminant. Therefore, even though 6 is the correct answer in theory, since it's not an option, the closest possible answer here must be C)3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem. But since the user is providing this as a question with those options, the answer must be C. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me check once again. \n\nWait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So the quadratic is opening upwards (since coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive). For real roots, the discriminant must be positive, so yes, 25-4k>0. So k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question was intended to have a different equation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the equation to have real roots but not necessarily distinct? But then discriminant can be zero or positive. But even then, the maximum k would be 6.25, so 6 as integer. Still not an option. \n\nHmm, maybe the question is the other way around? Like, the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0, then discriminant would be 25-4k. Still same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x -k =0. Then discriminant would be 25 +4k. So discriminant positive requires 25+4k>0 \u21924k> -25 \u2192k> -6.25. But then for real roots, any k greater than -6.25. But then if it's asking for two real roots, then the largest integer k would be unbounded unless there's another condition. But that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Given the options provided, the only possible correct answer is 3. Therefore, the answer must be C. \n\nWait, but the question says \"largest integral value of k\", so among all possible integers less than 6.25, the largest is 6, but since 6 isn't an option, the next lower is 5, but that's not there either. The highest option below 6.25 is 3. So the answer is C. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C)3.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the largest integer value of k for which the quadratic equation x\u00b2 -5x +k =0 has two real and distinct roots. Hmm, right. Let me remember how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I recall that for a quadratic equation ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0 to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be positive. The discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. So in this case, the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. Here, a is 1, b is -5, and c is k. \n\nCalculating the discriminant: D = (-5)\u00b2 -4*(1)*(k). That simplifies to 25 -4k. For two real and distinct roots, D has to be greater than 0. So 25 -4k >0. Let me solve that inequality.\n\n25 -4k >0 \u2192 -4k > -25. When I divide both sides by -4, I have to reverse the inequality sign because dividing by a negative number flips the inequality. So k < 25/4. Let me compute 25 divided by 4. That's 6.25. \n\nSo k must be less than 6.25. Since the question asks for the largest integer value of k, the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6. Wait, but looking at the options given, the choices are 9,7,3,8,12. Wait a second, none of the options have 6. That's odd. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nLet me check again. Maybe I messed up the discriminant. Let me recalculate. The discriminant is b squared minus 4ac. So b is -5, so (-5)^2 is 25. Then 4ac is 4*1*k, so 4k. So discriminant is 25-4k. So yes, that's correct. So discriminant must be greater than zero, so 25-4k>0 \u2192 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6, but the options don't have that. Hmm. Wait, looking back at the options: A is 9, B is7, C is3, D is8, E is12. None of these are 6. So maybe I made an error in the problem setup?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. The question is the largest integral value of k where there are two real and distinct roots. So according to my calculation, k has to be less than 6.25. The largest integer below that is 6, but 6 isn't an option. The options given are up to 12. So maybe there's a mistake in my approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check if the question is about real roots, but maybe the user made a typo or I misread the coefficients? Let me confirm the equation again. The equation is x squared minus 5x plus k equals zero. Yes. So coefficients are correct.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Wait, maybe I messed up the inequality direction? Let me go through the steps again. \n\nThe discriminant D =25 -4k must be >0. So 25 -4k>0 \u2192 25>4k \u2192 25/4 >k. 25/4 is 6.25. So yes, k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer possible is 6. Since the options given are up to 12, but 6 isn't listed, perhaps the options are wrong? Or maybe I misunderstood the question?\n\nWait, the options given are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None of these are 6.25 or below. Wait, so that suggests that perhaps I made an error in the discriminant. Maybe I have the sign wrong?\n\nWait, discriminant for ax\u00b2 +bx +c is b\u00b2-4ac. Here, a is 1, b is -5, c is k. So substituting, (-5)^2 is 25, minus 4*1*k. So 25-4k. That's correct. So D must be positive. So 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25. \n\nHmm, but the options given are higher. Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the largest integer where the roots are real and distinct, but maybe I need to check if there's a different interpretation. Like, maybe the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k=0, but maybe the user meant something else? Like perhaps the equation is x squared plus 5x plus k? Wait no, the question says x2 -5x +k. Oh, maybe I made a mistake in the sign of the discriminant?\n\nWait, another thought: maybe the problem is written as x\u00b2 -5x +k =0, so when the equation is written in standard form, the coefficients are correct. So the discriminant is indeed 25-4k. So the discriminant must be positive, so 25-4k>0 \u2192 k <6.25. So the maximum integer less than 6.25 is 6, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, or maybe I made a mistake in the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is about the roots being real and equal, but no, it says real and distinct. Alternatively, maybe the question is to find the smallest k? But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the inequality. Let me see again:\n\n25-4k >0 \u2192 subtract 25 from both sides: -4k > -25 \u2192 multiply both sides by (-1) which flips the inequality: 4k <25 \u2192 k <6.25. That's correct. So the maximum integer is 6, but that's not an option here. The options given are up to 12. So this is a problem. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says \"largest integral value of k\". The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k=0. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. None of these are less than 6.25 except 3 and maybe 7? Wait 7 is higher than 6.25. Wait, 6.25 is 6 and a quarter. So 7 is higher than that, so 7 would make the discriminant negative. Let me test k=7.\n\nIf k is 7: discriminant would be 25 -4*7 =25-28= -3, which is negative. So the roots would be complex. So 7 is not acceptable. Similarly for 8, 9, 12. So those would all give discriminant negative. Only 3 is less than 6.25. So 3 would be the only one that works. But the options have 3 as option C. But the question is asking for the largest possible k. So 6.25, the largest integer less than that is 6. So since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the problem is written wrong?\n\nWait, maybe the equation is different? Like maybe x\u00b2 +5x +k=0? Let me check. Suppose the equation was x\u00b2 +5x +k=0. Then discriminant would be 25-4k. So same as before. Wait, no, that would be same. Wait, perhaps the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0? Then the discriminant would be 25 +4k. Then discriminant must be positive, so 25+4k>0, but that would allow higher k. But that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is x squared plus 5x plus k? No, the question says minus 5x. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a mistake in the problem options. Because according to my calculations, the maximum integer k is 6, which isn't listed here. The options given have 3 as the only possible valid one. But the question is asking for the largest. So perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe I messed up the discriminant formula. Let me recalculate for each of the options given. Let's check each option's k value and see which is the largest possible where discriminant is positive.\n\nOption A: k=9. Discriminant is 25 -4*9 =25-36= -11 \u2192 negative. So roots not real. So invalid.\n\nOption B: k=7 \u2192 25-28= -3 \u2192 negative. So invalid.\n\nOption C: k=3 \u2192 25-12=13 \u2192 positive. So that's okay. \n\nOption D: k=8 \u2192 25-32= -7 \u2192 negative.\n\nOption E: k=12 \u2192 25-48= -23 \u2192 negative.\n\nSo among all the options given, only k=3 gives a positive discriminant. Therefore, the answer would be C)3. But wait, the question asks for the largest possible k. But 3 is the only valid one here. So maybe the options are wrong, but given the choices, 3 is the only correct one. But the question must have an answer here, so maybe I made an error in the discriminant?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was meant to have the equation x\u00b2 +5x +k =0? Let me check. If that's the case, then discriminant is 25-4k. Wait, same as before. Wait no, that's still the same. Wait, no. Wait, in that case, equation would be x\u00b2 +5x +k, so a=1, b=5, c=k. So discriminant is 25-4k. So same calculation. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x -k =0. Then discriminant would be 25 +4k. Then discriminant positive requires 25 +4k>0 \u2192 which is always true for positive k. But then the question would be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x = k, but that's not the same as x\u00b2-5x +k=0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is not about real and distinct roots but something else? But the question clearly states two real and distinct roots. \n\nWait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the inequality direction. Let me re-express the discriminant. For two real and distinct roots, discriminant D must be greater than zero. So D>0 \u219225-4k>0 \u2192k <6.25. So the largest integer less than 6.25 is 6. Since 6 isn't an option, perhaps the options provided are incorrect? But the user says the options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. \n\nWait, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me check each option again:\n\nk=3 \u2192 D=25-12=13 \u2192 positive. So that's okay. \n\nk=7 \u2192 D=25-28= -3 \u2192 nope. \n\nk=8 \u2192 25-32= -7 \u2192 nope. \n\nSo the only valid options are 3. So if the question is asking for the largest possible k among the given options where the equation has real roots, then 3 is the answer. But the question says \"largest integral value of k\", not the largest among the options. Wait, but the options given are the possible answers. So perhaps the question is from a source where maybe there was a typo, but given the options, the correct answer is 3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the equation's coefficients. Let me check once more. The equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So a=1, b=-5, c=k. Discriminant is (-5)^2 -4(1)(k) \u219225-4k. That's correct. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. The problem must have the options as given, so perhaps I made a mistake. Let me see the options again. The options are A)9, B)7, C)3, D)8, E)12. \n\nWait, maybe the question is actually asking for the smallest k? But that would be 3. But the question says largest. Alternatively, maybe I misread the equation as x squared plus 5x? Let me check again. The user wrote \"x2 -5x +k =0\". So it's x squared minus 5x plus k. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is written as x squared - 5x + k \u22640? No, that's not the case. \n\nHmm. Given the options provided, the only possible answer is C)3. Because all the other options would result in a negative discriminant. Therefore, even though 6 is the correct answer in theory, since it's not an option, the closest possible answer here must be C)3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem. But since the user is providing this as a question with those options, the answer must be C. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the discriminant. Let me check once again. \n\nWait, maybe the equation is x\u00b2 -5x +k =0. So the quadratic is opening upwards (since coefficient of x\u00b2 is positive). For real roots, the discriminant must be positive, so yes, 25-4k>0. So k must be less than 6.25. So the maximum integer k is 6, but since that's not an option, perhaps the question was intended to have a different equation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the equation to have real roots but not necessarily distinct? But then discriminant can be zero or positive. But even then, the maximum k would be 6.25, so 6 as integer. Still not an option. \n\nHmm, maybe the question is the other way around? Like, the equation is x\u00b2 +5x +k =0, then discriminant would be 25-4k. Still same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is written as x\u00b2 -5x -k =0. Then discriminant would be 25 +4k. So discriminant positive requires 25+4k>0 \u21924k> -25 \u2192k> -6.25. But then for real roots, any k greater than -6.25. But then if it's asking for two real roots, then the largest integer k would be unbounded unless there's another condition. But that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Given the options provided, the only possible correct answer is 3. Therefore, the answer must be C. \n\nWait, but the question says \"largest integral value of k\", so among all possible integers less than 6.25, the largest is 6, but since 6 isn't an option, the next lower is 5, but that's not there either. The highest option below 6.25 is 3. So the answer is C. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C)3.\n\n\nTo determine the largest integer value of \\( k \\) for which the quadratic equation \\( x^2 - 5x + k = 0 \\) has two real and distinct roots, we use the discriminant condition.
