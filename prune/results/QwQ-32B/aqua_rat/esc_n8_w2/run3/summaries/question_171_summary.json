      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about finding the cover price per issue of a magazine when given the subscription cost and the savings percentage. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe problem states that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. We need to find the cover price per issue. The options are from A to E, with various dollar amounts.\n\nAlright, so first, I need to understand what's being asked. The cover price is the regular price you'd pay per issue if you bought each one individually, right? The subscription is cheaper because it's a 25% discount. So the total subscription cost is 75% of the total cover price for all 15 issues. Because if you save 25%, you're paying 100% -25% =75% of the original total price.\n\nLet me write that down. Let's denote variables. Let me think. Let\u2019s let C be the cover price per issue. Then, the total cover price for 15 issues would be 15*C. The subscription price is $42, which is 75% of that total. So the equation would be:\n\n42 = 0.75 * (15 * C)\n\nYes, that makes sense. Because 25% off means you pay 75% of the original total. So solving for C would give me the cover price per issue.\n\nLet me solve that equation. Let's do the steps. First, multiply 15 and C, then multiply by 0.75, equals 42. To find C, divide both sides by 0.75 first.\n\nSo 42 divided by 0.75 equals 15*C. Let me calculate 42 / 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is 3/4, so dividing by 3/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) = ?\n\n42 divided by 3 is 14, so 14 *4 is 56. So that gives 56. So 56 =15*C. Then, C would be 56 divided by 15. Let me calculate that. 15 times 3 is 45, 56 minus 45 is 11. So 3 and 11/15. Let me convert that to decimal. 11 divided by 15 is 0.7333... So total is 3.7333... plus 3? Wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, 56 divided by 15 is 3.7333... because 15*3=45, 56-45=11, so 11/15 is approximately 0.7333. So 3.7333... dollars per issue. \n\nHmm, looking at the options, option A is $7.73, which is way higher. Wait, but the options have 3.73 as E. Wait, so 3.73 would be option E. But that would be the cover price? Let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again. Let me make sure I didn't flip anything. The problem says the subscription cost is $42, which is a saving of 25% of the cover prices. Wait, the wording here might be tricky. Let me parse that again.\n\nThe question says, \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the saving. Let me think again. Is the $42 the total after a 25% discount on the total cover price? Or is the saving 25% per issue?\n\nThe way it's phrased: \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". Hmm. The cover prices probably refers to the total of all the individual cover prices. So the total cover price for 15 issues would be 15*C. The saving is 25% of that total, so the subscription price is the total minus 25% of the total. Which would be 75% of the total. So my initial approach was correct. \n\nSo the equation is 42 = (1 - 0.25)*(15*C) \u2192 42 = 0.75*(15C). So solving that gives 42 /0.75 = 15C \u2192 56 =15C \u2192 C =56/15 \u22483.7333...\n\nSo that's approximately $3.73 per issue. Looking at the options, that's E. But wait, the options given are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. So E is the option. But wait, that seems low? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the saving. Let me read the question again. \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". Wait, perhaps the saving is 25% off each cover price. So each issue's cover price is C, so the subscription price per issue is C minus 25% of C, so 0.75C. Then total subscription cost is 15*(0.75C) = 10.875C. Which equals $42. So solving for C would be 42/(10.875) = ?\n\nWait, let me see. 10.875C =42 \u2192 C =42 /10.875. Let me compute that. 10.875 times 3.84 is... Hmm, perhaps better to do fractions. 10.875 is equal to 10 and 7/8, which is 87/8. Wait, 10.875 * 16 = 174? Wait maybe better to compute 42 divided by 10.875.\n\nLet me write 10.875 as 10 + 0.875. 0.875 is 7/8. So 10.875 = 87/8? Wait, no. 10.875 = 10 + 7/8 = (80/8 +7/8)=87/8. Wait, 87 divided by 8 is 10.875. So 42 divided by (87/8) is 42 * (8/87) = (42*8)/87. Let's compute that. 42*8=336. 336 divided by 87. Let me see: 87*3 is 261, 87*4=348. So 336-261=75. So 3 + 75/87. 75/87 simplifies to 25/29, which is approximately 0.862. So total is 3.862. Approximately $3.86, which is not one of the options. Hmm, so that approach gives a different answer. But that would be different than before. So which interpretation is correct?\n\nHmm, the problem states: \"the subscription for 15 issues... represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". So the saving is 25% of the total cover prices. So the total saving is 25% of (15*C). The subscription price is then the total cover price minus that saving, so 15C - 0.25*(15C) = 0.75*15C = 42. Which is the same as before. So the first approach is correct. So that gives the cover price per as ~3.73, which is E. But the options have E as 3.73, so that would be the answer. But wait, the options given here are A through E, and E is 3.73. But maybe I made an error in calculation. Let me check the math again.\n\nSo 42 divided by 0.75: 42 divided by 0.75. Let me do it step by step. 0.75 times 56 is 42. Because 0.75 *56 = 42. So 56 is the total cover price for 15 issues. So 56 divided by 15 is the per issue price. 56 divided by 15. Let's compute that. 15*3 =45, 56-45=11. 11/15 is 0.7333..., so 3.7333... which rounds to 3.73. So that is correct. So the answer would be E. \n\nBut wait, the options given in the problem are: \n\nA)7.73 \n\nB)6.73 \n\nC)5.73 \n\nD)4.73 \n\nE)3.73 \n\nSo yes, E is an option. But I have to make sure that I didn't misinterpret the question. Let me think again. Another way: perhaps the saving is 25% per issue. So each issue's subscription price is 25% less than the cover price. So per issue, the subscription price is 0.75*C. Then total subscription cost would be 15*(0.75*C) = 11.25*C =42. So solving for C would be 42 /11.25. Let me compute that. 11.25 *3.7333 is 42. Let me see 11.25 *3.7333. 11.25*3=33.75, 11.25*0.7333 is approximately 8.25. So total is 33.75 +8.25 =42. So 3.7333 is same as before. So that also gives the same result. Wait, so both interpretations lead to the same answer? Wait, how?\n\nWait, in this case, if the saving is 25% per issue, then the total saving is 25% of each cover price, so total saving would be 0.25*C *15. The total subscription price is 15*C minus that saving, which is 15*C - 3.75*C = 11.25*C. Which is the same as 15*(0.75C). So the equations are the same. So regardless of whether the saving is per issue or total, the math comes out the same. So the answer is indeed E. \n\nHmm, but looking at the options, E is the lowest. Maybe I'm missing something else. Let me check the question again. The question says \"the subscription ... represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". So the total saving is 25% of the total cover prices. Which would be 0.25*(15*C). So the subscription price is total cover price minus that saving, so 15C -0.25*15C = 0.75*15C =42. So same equation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that the subscription price is 25% of the cover price? But that would be a saving of 75%, which is not the case. The wording says \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". So the saving is 25%, so the subscription is 75% of the total. \n\nHmm, so I think my calculation is correct, so the answer should be E. But wait, the options given in the problem might have a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try plugging in the answer options to see. Let's take E, 3.73. Then the total cover price for 15 issues would be 15*3.73 = 55.95. 25% saving on that would be 55.95 *0.25 =13.9875. So the subscription price would be 55.95 -13.9875 =41.96, which is approximately $42. So that checks out. \n\nIf I try option D, which is 4.73. Then total cover price is 15*4.73 =70.95. 25% saving would be 70.95*0.25=17.7375. So subscription price would be 70.95 -17.7375 =53.21, which is way higher than 42. So that's not right. \n\nOption C: 5.73. 15*5.73=85.95. 25% of that is 21.4875. So 85.95-21.4875=64.46, not 42. \n\nOption B:6.73. 15*6.73=100.95. 25% saving would be 25.2375. Total subscription price would be 75.71, which is way more than 42. \n\nOption A:7.73. 15*7.73=115.95. 25% saving is 28.9875. So 115.95 -28.9875 =86.96, not 42. \n\nSo only option E gives a value close to 42. So that must be correct. Therefore, the answer should be E.\n",

Hmm, so the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price for 15 issues. \n\nWait, let me think. If the saving is 25%, that means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because if you save 25%, you're paying 100% -25% =75% of the original total. Right, so the $42 is 75% of what the total would be if you bought each issue at the cover price.\n\nLet me denote the cover price per issue as 'x'. Then the total cover price for 15 issues would be 15 times x, which is 15x. The subscription price is 75% of that, so:\n\n42 = 0.75 * (15x)\n\nI can solve for x here. Let me rearrange the equation. First, divide both sides by 0.75 to get the total cover price.\n\n42 / 0.75 = 15x\n\nCalculating 42 divided by 0.75. Let me do that. 42 divided by 0.75 is the same as 42 multiplied by 4/3, because 1/0.75 is 4/3. Let's see: 42 *4 = 168, divided by 3 is 56. So that gives 56 =15x. \n\nThen, to find x, divide both sides by 15. So x =56/15. Let me compute that. 15 times 3 is 45, subtract that from 56, leaves 11. 11 divided by 15 is 0.7333... So 3.7333... Wait, no. Wait, 56 divided by 15. Let me recalculate. Wait, 15*3.7333 would be 56?\n\nWait, 15 times 3 is 45, 15*0.7333 is about 11, so 45+11=56. Yes. So 56 divided by 15 is approximately 3.7333... So that's $3.7333 per issue. But looking at the options, the closest is E) $3.73 or maybe another option. Wait, the options given are A)$7.73, B)$6.73, C)$5.73, D)$4.73, E)$3.73.\n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me check my steps again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let's see:\n\nThe total subscription cost is $42, which is 75% of the total cover price. So total cover price would be 42 / 0.75 = 56. So 15 issues at cover price would be $56. Therefore, per issue, it's 56 divided by 15. Let me calculate that exactly. 15 times 3 is 45, 56-45 is 11. So 11/15 is 0.733333... So total per issue is 3.7333..., so approximately $3.73. That's option E. But wait, the options have E as $3.73. So that's correct?\n\nWait, but let me check another way. Let's think about the saving. If the cover price per issue is x, then the total for 15 is 15x. The subscription is 15x minus 25% of 15x, which equals 42. Alternatively, the saving is 25% of the total cover price, so 0.25*(15x) is the saving, so the subscription price is 15x - 0.25*15x = 0.75*15x = 42. That's the same equation as before, so the calculation is correct. So the cover price per issue is 56/15 \u22483.7333. So the answer should be E?\n\nBut wait, the options are given as E being 3.73. But wait, 3.7333 is approximately 3.73 when rounded to the nearest cent, right? Because the third decimal is 3, which is less than 5, so it would be 3.73. So yes, E is correct. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me read again. The subscription represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. Wait, does that mean that the saving is 25% of the cover price per issue, or the total?\n\nThe wording says \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". Hmm. So perhaps the total saving is 25% of the total cover price. Which is how I interpreted it. So the total you save is 25% of (15x), so the subscription is (15x - 0.25*15x) = 0.75*15x. So that's the same as before. So the calculation holds.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that each issue's subscription price is 25% off the cover price. Then the per issue subscription price would be 0.75x, so total subscription would be 15*(0.75x) = 11.25x = 42. Then x would be 42/(11.25) = 3.7333... same as before. So that also leads to the same answer. Either way, the same result.\n\nTherefore, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73, so answer E. But wait, the options are A to E, with E being the last one. But I need to check the options again. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) $7.73\n\nB)$6.73\n\nC)$5.73\n\nD)$4.73\n\nE)$3.73\n\nYes, so E is the correct answer. Hmm, but why are there higher options? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me double-check the division again. 56 divided by 15.\n\n15 times 3 is 45. 56 minus 45 is 11. 11 divided by 15 is 0.733333... So yes, 3.7333. So $3.73 when rounded to the nearest cent. So that's correct. So the answer should be E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Let me read again: \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". So the total saving is 25% of the total cover price. So total cover price is 15x. The saving is 0.25*(15x). Therefore, the subscription price is total cover price minus saving: 15x - 0.25*15x = 11.25x? Wait no. Wait, 15x minus 0.25*15x is 15x*(1-0.25) = 0.75*15x. So 0.75*15x =42. So 11.25x? Wait no, 0.75 multiplied by 15x is (0.75*15)x = 11.25x? Wait, 0.75 times 15 is 11.25? Yes. Because 15 * 0.75 is 11.25. So 11.25x =42. Therefore, x is 42 divided by 11.25. Let's compute that again. 42 divided by 11.25. Let's see:\n\n11.25 \u00d7 3.7333 is 42?\n\n11.25 \u00d7 3 = 33.75\n\n11.25 \u00d7 0.7333 \u2248 11.25 \u00d7 0.7 =7.875, plus 11.25\u00d70.0333\u22480.375. Total \u22487.875 +0.375=8.25. So total 33.75 +8.25=42. Exactly. So yes, x=3.7333. So that's correct. So the answer is E.\n",
