      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about converting a map distance to actual miles. Hmm, the question says that on the map, the road from Town F to G is 20 inches long. And the scale is 1/4 inch representing 10 miles. I need to find out the actual distance in miles.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many quarter inches are in 20 inches. Because the scale is given per 1/4 inch. So maybe if I can find out how many 1/4 inches make up 20 inches, then each of those parts equals 10 miles. \n\nWait, right. The scale is 1/4 inch = 10 miles. So each 0.25 inches on the map is 10 actual miles. To find out how many of those units are in 20 inches, I can divide 20 by 1/4. Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So 20 divided by (1/4) is 20 * 4, which is 80. So there are 80 quarter inches in 20 inches. \n\nEach of those quarter inches is 10 miles, so multiply 80 by 10. 80 times 10 is 800. So the actual distance should be 800 miles. Let me check the options. Option A is 800, so that's probably the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up a proportion. Let's see. If 1/4 inch equals 10 miles, then 1 inch would equal 10 divided by (1/4), which is 10 *4 =40 miles per inch. Then 20 inches would be 20 *40 = 800. Yeah that's the same result. So both methods lead to 800. So the answer must be A.\n",

And the road from F to G is 20 inches on the map. I need to find out the real distance.\n\nWait, first, maybe I should figure out how many 1/4 inches are in 20 inches. Because each of those quarter inches equals 10 miles. So if I can find how many quarter inches there are, multiply by 10, that should give the total miles.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set up a ratio. Let me think. Let's see, 1/4 inch corresponds to 10 miles. So the scale is 1/4 in : 10 mi. To find out how many miles 20 inches is, I can set up a proportion.\n\nLet me write that out. Let's let x be the actual distance. The proportion would be (1/4 inch)/10 miles = 20 inches/x miles. Wait, no, actually the ratio should be set up so that the inches over miles equals the same for both. Wait, maybe better to find out how many miles per inch first. Because the scale is given as 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So per inch, that would be 10 miles divided by 1/4 inch. Wait, yes, so 10 divided by (1/4) is 40. Because 10 divided by 0.25 is 40. So each inch on the map equals 40 miles. Then 20 inches would be 20 times 40. Let me calculate that. 20 *40 is 800. Hmm, so the answer would be A) 800?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I messed up the conversion. Let me go through another way. If 1/4 inch equals 10 miles, then 1 inch is 10 *4 =40 miles. So yes, that's the same as before. So 20 inches is 20 *40 = 800.
