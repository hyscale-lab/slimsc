      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so there's this problem about three bells ringing at different intervals, and I need to figure out when they'll all ring together again. Hmm, let me think. The intervals are 36, 40, and 48 seconds. The question is asking for the next time they all coincide. I remember that when things happen at regular intervals, the time they coincide again is the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals. Right, so LCM of 36, 40, and 48 seconds. \n\nFirst, I need to calculate the LCM. How do I do that? Well, LCM can be found by breaking each number into its prime factors. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with 36. Breaking it down: 36 divides by 2 to get 18, again by 2 to get 9, then 3 times 3. So 36 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2.\n\nNext, 40. 40 divided by 2 is 20, again by 2 is 10, again by 2 is 5. So that's 2\u00b3 \u00d7 5\u00b9.\n\nThen 48. Let's see, 48 divided by 2 is 24, then 12, 6, 3. So that's 2\u2074 \u00d7 3\u00b9.\n\nTo find LCM, take the highest power of each prime number present. So for 2, the highest exponent is 4 from 48. For 3, the highest is 2 from 36. And there's a 5 from 40. So LCM is 2\u2074 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d75\u00b9.\n\nCalculating that: 2\u2074 is 16, 3\u00b2 is 9, 5 is 5. Multiply them step by step. 16 \u00d7 9 is 144. Then 144 \u00d75. Let's see, 144 \u00d75 is 720. So the LCM is 720 seconds.\n\nWait, the options are in minutes. Let me convert 720 seconds to minutes. Since 60 seconds are a minute, divide by 60. 720 \u00f760 =12. So that's 12 minutes. So the answer should be option B, right?\n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the LCM calculation. Let me verify each step. \n\nFactors again:\n\n36 = 2\u00b2 *3\u00b2\n\n40=2\u00b3 *5\n\n48=2\u2074 *3\n\nYes. The LCM takes the max exponents: 2^4, 3^2, and 5^1. So 16 *9 is 144, times 5 is 720. That's correct. 720 seconds is 12 minutes. So option B says after 12 minutes. That's the answer. Wait, but why is option E there? Maybe I did something wrong. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check with another method. Let's list multiples of the largest number and see when they are common. The largest interval is 48. Let's see multiples of 48 and check if they are divisible by 36 and 40.\n\n48: 48. Div by 36? 48/36=1.333\u2026 no. Div by 40? 48/40=1.2 no. Next multiple: 96. 96 divided by 36 is 2.666\u2026 no. 96/40=2.4. Nope.\n\n144: 144/36=4, yes. 144/40=3.6, no. Not divisible by 40. Next 192: 192/36=5.333, no. 192/40=4.8, nope.\n\n240: 240/36=6.666\u2026 no. 240/40=6, yes. But 240 divided by 36 is not integer. Hmm. Next multiple: 288. 288/36=8, yes. 288/40=7.2, no.\n\n336: 336/36=9.333\u2026 no. 336/40=8.4, nope.\n\n384: 384/36=10.666\u2026 no.\n\n432: 432/36=12, yes. 432/40=10.8. Not integer.\n\n480: 480/36=13.333\u2026 no. 480/40=12, yes. But 480/36 not integer.\n\nHmm, maybe going this way is taking too long. Let me try 720. 720 divided by 36 is 20, yes. 720/40 is 18, yes. 720/48 is 15. So yes, that works. So the LCM is indeed 720. So 12 minutes is correct, which is option B. Therefore the answer must be B. The options given include B as 12 minutes, so that's the right choice. I think E is a trap if someone miscalculates. So I'll go with B.\n",
