      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is asking for the greatest number of identical bouquets we can make using 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips without leaving any flowers out. Hmm, right. The key here is that each bouquet has to be identical, which means each bouquet must have the same number of white and red tulips. And all flowers must be used.\n\nLet me think. So, if I want the maximum number of bouquets, I need to divide both the white and red tulips into groups such that each group has the same number of each color. The number of bouquets would be the same for both colors. So, like, the number of bouquets has to be a divisor of both 28 and 98? Because each bouquet takes some number of white and red, so the total white used would be (number of bouquets) \u00d7 (white per bouquet) = 28. Similarly for red. So the number of bouquets must divide both 28 and 98. And since we want the greatest number, that's the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98, right?\n\nWait, yes. The GCD of the two numbers gives the largest number that can divide both. So the GCD of 28 and 98. Let me compute that.\n\nBreaking down into prime factors maybe. Let's see:\n\n28 factors: 2 \u00d7 14, which is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 7. So 2\u00b2 \u00d77.\n\n98 factors: 2 \u00d749, which is 2 \u00d77\u00b2. So 2 \u00d77\u00b2.\n\nThe GCD is the product of the smallest powers of the primes present. So primes are 2 and 7. The minimum exponent for 2 is 1 (since 28 has 2\u00b2 and 98 has 2^1). For 7, the minimum exponent is 1 (since 28 has 7^1 and 98 has 7^2). So GCD is 2 \u00d77 =14. So the answer would be 14, which is option D. Wait but let me check again.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If the GCD is 14, then each bouquet would have 28/14 = 2 white tulips and 98/14=7 red tulips. So each bouquet has 2 white and 7 red. That uses up all the flowers. Since 14 bouquets each with 2 white would be 28, and 14\u00d77 is 98. So that works. \n\nIs there a higher number possible? Let's see. Suppose someone thought maybe 21? Let's check. 21 divides 28? 28 divided by 21 is 1.333... which isn't an integer, so that's no. So 21 can't be. How about 7? Then 28/7 is 4, 98/7 is 14. So that would make 7 bouquets each with 4 white and 14 red. That works, but since 14 is higher, that's better. \n\nWait, what about 14? That works as I saw. So the GCD is 14, so the answer should be D. Let me check the options again. The options are A)4, B)7, C)10, D)14, E)21. Yep, so D is there. So the answer is D.\n",

And we need to maximize the number of such bouquets.\n\nLet me think. So, if I want the maximum number of bouquets, I need to divide both the white and red tulips into equal parts.

Because GCD finds the largest number that divides both numbers, which would allow splitting both into equal groups.\n\nLet me check. The GCD of 28 and 98. Let's compute that. The factors of 28 are 1,2,4,7,14,28. For 98, the factors are 1,2,7,14,49,98. The common factors are 1,2,7,14. The greatest is 14. So the GCD is 14.

So, 98 divided by 28. 28*3 is 84, remainder 14. Then, 28 divided by 14 is 2 with 0 remainder. So the GCD is 14. Yeah that's correct. So the answer should be D)14. Let me check the options again. The options are A)4, B)7, C)10, D)14, E)21. So D is an option. \n\nWait, but why isn't it 7? Let me think again. If I take 7, then each bouquet would have 4 white and 14 red.
