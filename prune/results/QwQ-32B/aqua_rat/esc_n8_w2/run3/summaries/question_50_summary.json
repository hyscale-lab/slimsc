      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about increasing a product's price after a discount. Let me see. The problem says that the price is reduced by 30%, and then they want to know what percentage increase is needed to bring it back to 100%. Hmm, right. I think I need to work through this step by step.\n\nLet me start by assuming the original price is, say, $100. That might make the calculations easier. If the original price is $100 and it's reduced by 30%, then the new price after the discount would be 70% of the original. So 30% off of 100 is 70. So the discounted price is $70.\n\nNow, the question is, what percentage increase from $70 will bring it back to the original $100? So we need to find the percentage increase required on $70 to get to $100. \n\nThe formula for percentage increase is: ((Final - Initial)/Initial) * 100%. \n\nIn this case, the final value is 100, the initial after discount is 70. So the difference is 30. So the calculation would be (30 /70)*100. Let me compute that. \n\n30 divided by 70 is the same as 3/7. Let me calculate 3 divided by 7. 3 divided by 7 is approximately 0.42857. Multiplying by 100 gives about 42.857%. So that's roughly 42.86%, right?\n\nLooking at the options, option B is 42.86%. So the answer should be B. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set it up algebraically to confirm. Let me let the original price be P. After a 30% decrease, the new price is 0.7P. We need to find the percentage increase x such that 0.7P * (1 + x) = P. Solving for x: (1 + x) = P/(0.7P) = 1/0.7 \u2248 1.42857. So x is approximately 0.42857, which is 42.857%, so 42.86% when rounded to two decimal places. That matches the first calculation. \n\nSo the correct answer is B, 42.86%. The other options are close but not exactly. Like option A is 41.86 which would be if maybe I miscalculated, but no, 3/7 is definitely about 0.428. So yeah, B is the right choice.\n",

The product's price is reduced by 30%, and then we need to figure out what percentage increase is required to bring it back to the original price. Hmm, right. I remember that percentage decreases and increases aren't symmetrical. Like, if something goes down by 20%, you can't just go up 20% to get back. Because the base changes.\n\nLet me start by setting up some variables. Let's say the original price is, I don't know, maybe $100 to make the math easy. Wait, but the answer options are percentages, so maybe the actual number doesn't matter. Let's see.\n\nSuppose the original price is P. After a 30% reduction, the new price is P minus 30% of P. So that's P*(1 - 0.30) = 0.70P. Now, we need to find the percentage increase needed on this new price (0.70P) to get back to the original P. \n\nSo let's call the required percentage increase x. The formula would be: \n\nNew price after increase = 0.70P * (1 + x) \n\nWe want this to equal the original price P. So:\n\n0.70P * (1 + x) = P \n\nDivide both sides by P (assuming P isn't zero, which makes sense here):\n\n0.70*(1 + x) = 1 \n\nNow, solve for x. \n\nDivide both sides by 0.70:\n\n1 + x = 1 / 0.70 \n\nCalculate 1 divided by 0.70. Let me do that. 1 / 0.7 is the same as 10/7, right? Because 0.7 is 7/10. So 1 divided by 7/10 is 10/7. \n\n10 divided by 7 is approximately 1.42857... \n\nSo 1 + x = 1.42857... \n\nSubtract 1 from both sides:\n\nx = 0.42857... \n\nTo convert that to a percentage, multiply by 100: 42.857... percent. \n\nLooking at the options, that's option B)42.86%. Because 0.42857 is approximately 42.86 when rounded to two decimal places. Let me check the options again. \n\nOptions are A)41.86%, B)42.86%, so yes, B is the right one. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake. Let me verify with an example.

Now, to get back to $100 from $70, the increase needed is $30. \n\nSo the percentage increase is (30 /70)*100. 30 divided by 70 is 0.42857..., which is exactly 42.857%, so when rounded to two decimal places, that's 42.86%. Yep, so B is correct. \n\nHmm, I think that's solid. The key here is understanding that the base for the percentage increase is the reduced price, not the original. So the answer must be B.\n",
