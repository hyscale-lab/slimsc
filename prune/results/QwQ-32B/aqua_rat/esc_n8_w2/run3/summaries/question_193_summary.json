      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here about a two-digit number. Hmm. The question says that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. And also, the unit's digit is twice the ten's digit. I need to find which of the options is correct. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The two-digit number is, say, 10a + b, where a is the ten's digit and b is the unit's digit. Right? Because for a two-digit number, the first digit is multiplied by 10. So the number is 10a + b. \n\nThe problem states two things. First, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. The sum of the digits is a + b. So the number (10a + b) minus (a + b) equals 18. Let me write that equation down:\n\n10a + b - (a + b) = 18. \n\nSimplifying that: 10a + b -a -b = 9a = 18. So 9a =18, which means a is 2. Wait, that seems straightforward. So the ten's digit a is 2? But hold on, there's another condition. The unit's digit is double the ten's digit. So b = 2a. \n\nIf a is 2, then b would be 4. So the number would be 24. Let me check if that fits the first condition. Let's see: 24 minus the sum of its digits (2 +4) is 24 -6 = 18. Yes, that works. So 24 would be option B. But wait, let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nLooking at the options: B is 24, C is 42. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Because if the unit's digit is double the ten's, then in 42, the ten's digit is 4 and unit is 2? Wait no, in 42, ten's digit is 4 and unit is 2. But then the unit's digit would be half of the ten's, not double. So that can't be. So 42 wouldn't satisfy the second condition. So the correct one would be 24, which is option B. But let me check again.\n\nWait, wait a second. The problem says \"the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place\". So unit digit = 2*(ten's digit). So if the ten's digit is a, then unit digit is 2a. So in the first calculation, I had a=2, so b=4. That's correct. So the number is 24. Let me check the other options again. \n\nBut hold on, maybe I made an error in the equation. Let me go through that again. The first equation: the number is 10a + b. The sum of digits is a + b. The number exceeds the sum by 18, so (10a +b) - (a + b) = 18. That simplifies to 9a =18 \u2192 a=2. That seems right. So then b is 2a \u2192 4. So the number is 24. So B is the answer. But let me check the other options again. \n\nLooking at option C:42. Ten's digit is 4, unit is 2. Then the unit digit is 2, which is half of 4, not double. So that's not meeting the condition. Option D is 48: ten's is 4, unit is 8. Then unit is double the ten's (8=2*4). Wait a minute! Oh! Wait, 48's unit digit is 8, which is double the ten's digit 4. So that would satisfy the second condition. Hmm, so why didn't I get that?\n\nWait, let's see. If the ten's digit was 4, then unit digit would be 8. Then the number is 48. Let's check the first condition. The sum of the digits is 4+8=12. The number 48 minus 12 is 36, which is way more than 18. So that doesn't fit. So 48 can't be the answer. \n\nHmm. So why did I get a=2 from the first equation? Because the first equation only gives a=2 regardless of the second condition. The second condition is that b=2a. So combining both equations: from first equation a is 2, so then b must be 4, so the number is 24. \n\nWait, but what if I approached it differently. Let me set up both equations again. \n\nLet me define variables again properly. Let the ten's digit be x, unit's digit be y. So the number is 10x + y. \n\nFirst condition: the number exceeds the sum by 18 \u2192 (10x + y) - (x + y) =18 \u2192 9x =18 \u2192x=2. \n\nSecond condition: y = 2x \u2192 so y=2*2=4. Therefore, the number is 24. So that's correct. So the answer must be B. \n\nWait, but option C is 42. Let me check why I thought of that. Because maybe I confused the digits? Like, if someone thought that the unit digit is double, so 42 has 2 in the unit, which is half. So that's not. \n\nWait, so why is 42 an option here? Let me check the problem again. Did I misread the condition? The problem says \"the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place\". So unit digit (y) is 2 times ten's (x). So yes, y=2x. \n\nSo the correct digits are x=2 and y=4 \u2192 24. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the equations. Let me try another approach. Suppose the number is, say, 24. Then sum of digits is 6. 24-6=18. That works. Unit digit is 4, which is 2*2. So that's correct. \n\nAnother option, like 48: sum is 12, 48-12=36. Not 18. So no. \n\nOption 49: ten's digit 4, unit 9. 9 is not double 4 (8 would be). So no. \n\nOption 12: ten's 1, unit 2. 2 is double 1. So that's possible. Let's check. 12 minus (1+2)=9. 12-3=9. 9 is not 18. So that's not. \n\nSo 12 gives a difference of 9, which is half of required. So 24 is the correct one. \n\nTherefore the answer is B)24.\n",

Also, the unit's digit is twice the ten's digit. I need to find which of the options is correct.\n\nFirst, let's break down what's given. Let me denote the ten's digit as, say, x. Then the unit's digit would be 2x because it's double. Since it's a two-digit number, the actual number can be written as 10 times the ten's digit plus the unit's digit. So the number is 10x + 2x. Wait, that would be 12x? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the ten's place is x, so 10*x, and the unit's place is 2x, so adding those gives 10x + 2x = 12x. So the number is 12x.\n\nNow, the problem states that this number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. The sum of the digits is x + 2x = 3x. So the number (which is 12x) minus the sum (3x) equals 18. So the equation would be 12x - 3x = 18. That simplifies to 9x = 18, so x = 2. \n\nIf x is 2, then the ten's digit is 2 and the unit's digit is 4 (since 2x is 4). So the number would be 24. Wait, but looking at the options, B is 24 and C is 42. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the digits. Let me confirm. The ten's digit is x, so the number is 10x + (unit digit). The unit digit is twice the ten's, so unit digit is 2x. So the number is 10x + 2x = 12x. The sum is x + 2x = 3x. The difference between the number and the sum is 12x - 3x = 9x = 18. So x is 2. Then the number is 12*2 =24. That's option B. But wait, the options have C as 42. Hmm, maybe I made an error here. Let me see the options again. \n\nWait, the problem says the digit at the unit's place is double the ten's. So if the ten's digit is 2, the unit is 4, so the number is 24. Which is option B. But let me check the options again. The options are A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49. So B is 24. That seems right. \n\nWait, but maybe I messed up the equation. Let me re-express the problem again. The number is 10a + b. The sum of digits is a + b. The problem states that the number exceeds the sum by 18, so 10a + b = (a + b) + 18. Also, the unit digit (b) is twice the ten's (a), so b = 2a. \n\nSubstituting b=2a into the first equation: 10a + 2a = (a + 2a) +18 \u2192 12a = 3a +18 \u2192 9a=18 \u2192 a=2. So then b is 4.

Sum of digits 2+4=6. 24-6=18. That works. So that's correct. \n\nOption C is 42. Let's see: sum is 4+2=6. 42-6=36, which is way more than 18. So that's not. \n\nOption D:48. Sum is 12. 48-12=36 again. Not 18. \n\nA:12. Sum is 3. 12-3=9, not 18. \n\nE:49. Sum is 13. 49-13=36. \n\nSo B is correct. Then why does option C exist? Maybe I need to check again. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read again. \n\n\"A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18. If the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, what is the number?\"\n\nSo unit's digit is double the ten's. So unit digit is 2*(ten's). So in 24, unit is 4, ten's is 2: yes, 4 is 2*2. So that's correct. So B is the right answer. Hmm, but why is there an option C as 42? Because maybe someone might reverse the digits? Like if someone thought the ten's is double the unit's. But the problem clearly states unit's is double the ten's. So yeah, B is correct. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me recheck. The number is 10a + b. The sum is a + b. The number exceeds the sum by 18, so (10a + b) - (a + b) = 18 \u2192 9a =18 \u2192 a=2. Exactly. So that's right. So the answer must be B. \n\nHmm, but maybe I should check again the problem's wording. \"exceeds the sum of the digits by 18\"\u2014so yes, the number is sum +18. So 24 is sum 6 plus 18 gives 24. That's correct. So answer B. So why is the option C there? Maybe a common mistake where someone swaps the digits. Like if they thought the ten's digit is double the unit's, then 42 would be the case. Let me see: if ten's digit is double the unit's, then let unit be x, ten's 2x. Then number would be 20x +x=21x. Sum is 2x +x=3x. Then 21x -3x=18 \u219218x=18 \u2192x=1. So number would be 21, which isn't an option. So that's not the case. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)24. But wait the options given in the problem include B as 24 and C as 42. So I think the answer is B. But wait, the initial calculation says so. Maybe I was overcomplicating. Yeah, the answer must be B.\n",

So in 24, unit is 4, ten's is 2: yes, 4 is 2*2. So that's correct. So B is the right answer. Hmm, but why is there an option C as 42? Because maybe someone might reverse the digits? Like if someone thought the ten's is double the unit's. But the problem clearly states unit's is double the ten's. So yeah, B is correct. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me recheck. The number is 10a + b. The sum is a + b. The number exceeds the sum by 18, so (10a + b) - (a + b) = 18 \u2192 9a =18 \u2192 a=2. Exactly. So that's right. So the answer must be B. \n\nHmm, but maybe I should check again the problem's wording. \"exceeds the sum of the digits by 18\"\u2014so yes, the number is sum +18. So 24 is sum 6 plus 18 gives 24. That's correct. So answer B. So why is the option C there? Maybe a common mistake where someone swaps the digits. Like if they thought the ten's digit is double the unit's, then 42 would be the case. Let me see: if ten's digit is double the unit's, then let unit be x, ten's 2x. Then number would be 20x +x=21x. Sum is 2x +x=3x. Then 21x -3x=18 \u219218x=18 \u2192x=1. So number would be 21, which isn't an option. So that's not the case. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)24. But wait the options given in the problem include B as 24 and C as 42. So I think the answer is B. But wait, the initial calculation says so. Maybe I was overcomplicating. Yeah, the answer must be B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the ten's digit be \\( x \\). The unit's digit is then \\( 2x \\) since it is double the ten's digit. The two-digit number can be expressed as \\( 10x + 2x = 12x \\). The sum of the digits is \\( x + 2x = 3x \\). According to the problem, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18:\n\n\\[\n12x - 3x = 18 \\implies 9x = 18 \\implies x = 2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 2 \\), the ten's digit is 2 and the unit's digit is \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\). Thus, the number is \\( 10 \\times 2 + 4 = 24 \\).\n\nVerification:\n- The sum of the digits \\( 2 + 4 = 6 \\).\n- The number \\( 24 \\) exceeds this sum by \\( 24 - 6 = 18 \\), satisfying the condition.\n\nTesting other options confirms they do not meet the criteria. For example:\n- **Option C (42)**: Sum \\( 4 + 2 = 6 \\), difference \\( 42 - 6 = 36 \\neq 18 \\).\n- **Option B (24)** is correct.\n\nAnswer: B",
