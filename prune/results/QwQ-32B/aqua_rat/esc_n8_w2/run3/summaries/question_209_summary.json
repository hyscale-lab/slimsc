      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. The problem is 900 plus 5 multiplied by 12. Hmm, right, I need to remember the order of operations here. Oh right, PEMDAS\u2014Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So multiplication comes before addition. \n\nSo first, I should calculate the 5 times 12 part. Let me do that. 5 multiplied by 12 is... 60, right? Yeah, 5 times 10 is 50, plus 5 times 2 is 10, so 60 total. Then add that to 900. \n\nSo 900 plus 60 equals... 960. Let me check the options. Option E is 960. So the answer must be E. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. If someone just did 900 plus 5 first, that would be 905 times 12, which is way bigger, but that's not the case here. No, the multiplication comes after. Yeah, order of operations is key here. So yeah, E is correct.\n",

Wait, I remember that in math problems like this, you have to follow the order of operations, right? Oh right, PEMDAS\u2014Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). So multiplication comes before addition. \n\nSo first, I need to calculate the 5 multiplied by 12. Let's do that. 5 times 12 is... 60, right? Yeah, because 5 times 10 is 50 and 5 times 2 is 10, so 50+10 is 60. Then, add that result to 900. So 900 plus 60. Let me add those. 900 + 60 is 960. Wait, that's one of the options. Let me check the options again. Option E is 960. So the answer must be E. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mess up the order. If someone just did 900 plus 5 first, that would be 905 times 12, which is way bigger, but that's not the case here. The problem is written as 900 + (5\u00d712), so yeah, multiplication first. So yeah, definitely E. Let me check the options again: A is 820, which would be if you did 900 - (5\u00d716) or something, but no. B is 202, way too small. C is 420, which is 900 minus 480 maybe.
