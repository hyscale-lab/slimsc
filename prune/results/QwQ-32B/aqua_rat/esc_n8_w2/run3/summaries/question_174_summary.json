      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about comparing the average annual cost of new tires versus repairing the current ones. I need to figure out the percentage increase. Let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nSo, the new tires last four years and cost $180 each. The repair option is $40 per tire and extends the current tires' life by one year. Wait, does that mean the current tires already have some remaining life, and each repair adds a year? Or is the repair starting from now? The problem says \"current tires can be repaired at $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So maybe the customer is choosing between buying new (which last four years) or repairing the current ones each year? Or maybe the current tires are already in use and the repair adds a year? Hmm, the problem might be that the customer has current tires that can be repaired each year to extend their life by one year each time. Or perhaps the question is comparing the cost over a certain period?\n\nWait, the question says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So I think we need to calculate the average annual cost for each option and then find the percentage difference between them. \n\nLet me think. For the new tires, the cost is $180 per tire, and they last four years. So the average annual cost would be 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180/4 = 45. So that's $45 per year. \n\nNow, for the repair option. The problem says the customer can choose to repair the current tires at $40 per tire, which gives an additional year. Wait, but how many years are we considering here? Since the new tires last four years, maybe the repair option needs to be considered over the same four-year period? Or is the repair only for one year? \n\nWait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me parse the problem again carefully. \n\nThe new tires last four years when new. The repair option is to have the current tires repaired at $40 per tire, which makes them last for one additional year. So each repair adds one year. So if the customer chooses to repair, they can do that each year? Or just once? The problem might be that the current tires, when not repaired, last how long? Wait, the problem doesn't specify how long the current tires would last without repair. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I misread the question.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the current tires can be repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So perhaps the current tires, without repair, would last for a certain period, but when repaired, they last an extra year. However, the problem doesn't state the original lifespan of the current tires. Wait, maybe the question is implying that the customer is considering whether to replace the current tires (which would be at the end of their life?) with new ones, or repair them each year? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires are already at a point where they can be repaired to last one more year, and the new tires would last four more years. So the comparison is between buying new tires (lasting four years) versus repairing the current tires once (to get one more year) and then perhaps needing to replace them after that? Or maybe the repair can be done every year? \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me see the question again: \"The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So perhaps the time frame is the same for both options? Like, over four years, how do the costs compare?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair gives one additional year, so to get the same four-year lifespan as the new tires, the customer would need to repair the current tires three times (since each repair adds a year). Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simpler. Let me think of the problem as comparing the annual cost of the new tires versus the annual cost of repairing the current ones each year. \n\nWait, the problem states that the new tires cost $180 and last four years. The repair is $40 per tire and gives one additional year. So if the customer chooses to repair the current tires, each repair gives one year. But how many years is the customer planning to keep the current tires? Since the question is about average cost per year, perhaps the comparison is over the same time period. Since the new tires last four years, maybe we need to calculate the cost of repairing the current tires over four years, which would require multiple repairs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires, when not repaired, have a certain lifespan. But since the problem doesn't state that, perhaps the problem is structured such that the customer can choose between:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180, which last four years. \n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires each year at $40 per repair, so each year you pay $40 to get one more year. So over four years, you'd pay 4 * $40 = $160. \n\nBut then the average cost per year for new tires is 180/4=45, and for repairs it's 160/4=40. Then the difference is 5, so 5/40 is 12.5% increase. Wait, but that would be option C. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires already have some remaining life. For example, maybe they were going to last one more year without repair, so by repairing, you get an additional year each time. But since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps the question is intended to have the repair cost spread over one year. Wait, maybe the problem is that the current tires, if not repaired, would last for one year. Then repairing them adds another year. Wait, but that's an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured as follows: the customer has current tires that need to be replaced in four years. But that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem is comparing over a one-year period. Wait, but the question says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires\". \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the customer can choose between two options over the same time period. Let me think again. Let's consider the time frame as four years. \n\nIf the customer buys new tires, they pay $180 once and have tires that last four years. The average annual cost is 180/4 = $45 per year. \n\nAlternatively, if they choose to repair the current tires each year, each repair gives one year of use. So over four years, they would have to repair the tires four times (once each year?), costing 4 * $40 = $160. So the average annual cost would be 160/4 = $40. \n\nThen, the difference between the new tires' average cost ($45) and the repair's average ($40) is $5. The question is asking by what percentage the new tires' cost is greater than the repair's. \n\nSo the percentage increase is (5/40)*100 = 12.5%. That would be option C. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made an assumption here. The problem says \"the current tires can be repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So each repair adds a year. But how many repairs would be needed over four years? If you start now, maybe the first repair gives one year, then another repair after that, etc. So each year you have to pay $40 to get another year. Therefore, over four years, you need four repairs, costing 4*40=160, leading to 40 per year. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires already have a certain lifespan. For example, perhaps the current tires have one year left without any repair, and each repair adds another. So to get four years total, you need three repairs? Let me see. \n\nSuppose the current tires have 1 year remaining. Repairing them once gives them another year (total 2 years). To reach four years, you need three repairs. So three repairs would cost 3*40 = 120. The total cost would be 120 over four years, so 30 per year. Then the difference between 45 and 30 is 15, so 15/30 is 50%? But that's not an option. Hmm, but the problem doesn't state the original lifespan of the current tires. \n\nThis is a problem. The question must have given enough information, so I must have misunderstood. \n\nWait, the problem says \"Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years.\" So the new tires last four years. The customer can choose to buy new (so four-year lifespan) or repair current ones. The repair is $40 per tire, which gives one additional year. \n\nAh, maybe the current tires are already at a point where they are about to be replaced. Let me think. Suppose the customer is deciding between replacing them now (so paying $180 for new tires that last four years) or repairing the current ones now, which would give them one more year. But then after that year, they would have to decide again. \n\nWait, but the question is about average cost per year. So perhaps the customer is considering over the next four years. \n\nIf they choose new tires, they pay $180 upfront and get four years. \n\nIf they choose to repair the current tires each year, then each year they pay $40 to get one more year. So over four years, they pay 4*$40 = $160. \n\nThus, average cost per year for new: 180/4 = 45. For repairs: 160/4=40. \n\nThe question is asking by what percentage is 45 greater than 40. \n\nThe formula is ((45 -40)/40)*100 = (5/40)*100 = 12.5%, which is option C. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%. \n\nSo 12.5% is option C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the current tires are already in use and have some remaining life. For example, maybe they have one year left. So if you repair them now, you get an extra year, making it two years total. But then to reach four years, you need to repair again after the first year. Wait, but each repair only adds a year. \n\nSo if they have 1 year left, then repair once gives 2 years. To get to four, they need to repair three times? Let's see:\n\nFirst repair gives +1, so total 2 years. Then after those two years, another repair gives another year, making it 3, then another repair for 4. So total of three repairs. \n\nSo total cost would be 3*40 = 120 over four years. Then average is 30. Then the difference between 45 and 30 is 15. 15/30 is 50% which isn't an option. \n\nHmm, but the problem didn't state the original lifespan of the current tires. So maybe that's an oversight. Alternatively, perhaps the current tires are being considered as needing replacement now, so their remaining lifespan is zero. So without repair, they can't be used anymore. So to use them for one year, you have to repair them. \n\nWait, that's possible. If the current tires are at the end of their life, so if you don't repair them, they can't be used. So each repair gives you an additional year. So to use them for four years, you need four repairs. \n\nTherefore, the total cost would be 4*40=160 over four years. Which brings us back to 40 per year. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering only the cost over one year. Wait, no, the average cost per year of the new tires is compared to the cost of repairing the current tires. \n\nWait the question says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So maybe the time period is the same as the lifespan of the new tires, which is four years. \n\nSo for new tires: total cost 180, over four years. So average is 45. \n\nFor the repair option, to get four years of use, you have to repair four times (each year), costing 4*40=160. So average is 40. \n\nThe percentage increase from 40 to 45 is (5/40)*100 = 12.5%. So answer C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. The repair gives one additional year. So if you repair once, you get one year. The new tires give four years. \n\nWait, but then comparing the average cost for each scenario over their lifespans. \n\nThe new tires' average cost per year is 180/4 =45. \n\nThe repair's average cost over one year would be 40. \n\nThen, the question is comparing the new's average (45) to the repair's (40). So the increase is 5, which is 5/40 = 12.5%. \n\nAh, maybe that's the case. The problem says \"the cost of repairing the current tires\"\u2014 perhaps the repair is a one-time cost for one year, so the average cost per year for repairing is 40. \n\nIn that case, the new tires average is 45, which is 5 more than 40. \n\nSo 5/40 is 12.5%, so C again. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \n\nWait, but the question says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" \n\nThe wording might be that the repair cost is 40 per year, so the average for new is 45, which is 12.5% higher than 40. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair is a one-time cost. For example, if the customer repairs their current tires once, they can get an extra year, so over that year, the cost is 40. So the average cost per year for the repair is 40. The new tires cost 180 over four years, so 45 per year. \n\nSo yes, the difference is 5. 5/40 is 12.5%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about comparing the average annual cost of new tires versus repairing the current ones. The goal is to find out by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater than the repair cost. Alright, let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the new tires cost $180 each and last four years. The repair option is $40 per tire, extending their life by one year. Wait, but how many years do the current tires already last? The problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So if the customer is considering repairing the current tires, I guess that implies the current tires are already in use. But the problem doesn't specify how old they are. Wait, maybe the question is considering the scenario where the customer has the current tires and is choosing between replacing them now with new ones (which would last four more years) or repairing them to get one more year. Or perhaps the current tires are at the end of their life? Hmm, maybe I need to read the question again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the current tires can be repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So the current tires, if not repaired, would last how long? The problem says when purchased new they last four years. But maybe the current tires are already three years old? Wait, the problem doesn't specify. Wait, maybe the question is assuming that the customer is at the point where the current tires are about to need replacement. But since the question is about comparing the average cost, perhaps the time periods need to be considered over the same duration.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured such that the customer is choosing between buying new tires (which last four years) versus repairing the current ones once (so that they last an extra year, so total of five years?), but I might be getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says the customer can choose to purchase new tires at $180 each, or have current tires repaired for $40 each. The repair makes the current tires last one additional year. So, the current tires, if not repaired, would have how much remaining life? Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering the current tires as already having three years left? Or maybe the customer is at the point where the current tires are about to need replacement, so they can either replace them (getting four years) or repair them once to get one more year. Wait, but the question is about the average cost per year. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires are already at the point where they need to be either replaced now (so new ones last four years) or repaired now to get one more year. So, the repair gives an extra year, so the total lifespan of the current tires would be 1 year after repair? Or maybe the current tires have already been used for some time. Wait, maybe the problem is considering that the current tires are in their last year and can be repaired once to extend to one more year. But the problem might not require knowing the current age. Let's think in terms of the costs over the period they cover.\n\nThe problem is asking for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repair cost. Let me rephrase the question:\n\nWhat is the average annual cost of buying new tires versus the average annual cost of repairing the current ones, and then find what percent higher the new tires are compared to the repair.\n\nWait, but the repair is a one-time cost? Or can the repair be done multiple times? The problem says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So each repair gives one more year. But the question doesn't specify how many times the customer can repair. Maybe we have to assume that the customer is choosing between replacing now (getting 4 years) or repairing once (getting 1 year). Or perhaps the customer can choose between buying new tires which last four years, or repairing the current tires once, which gives an extra year. But then, comparing over the same time period? Hmm, maybe the question is considering the cost over the same period. Let's see the options given. The answer choices are percentages, so perhaps the time periods must be considered to be the same.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured so that the customer can choose between two options over the same duration. Let me think. Let me try to model both scenarios.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires. Cost is $180 per tire. They last four years. So average annual cost is 180 /4 = $45 per year.\n\nOption 2: Repair current tires. The repair costs $40 per tire, which extends their life by one year. Wait, but how long do the current tires last before the repair? The problem says when purchased new, they last four years. So if the current tires are being repaired, perhaps they are already used for three years and have one year left? Or maybe the current tires have already been used for some time, but the problem doesn't specify. Wait, this might be a problem. Maybe the question is considering that the customer is at a point where the current tires need to be either replaced now (for four more years) or repaired once now to get one more year. But then, the repair gives one more year, so the total time for the repair option would be 1 year. But comparing the average cost over the same period? That might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the repair can be done multiple times. For instance, if the customer chooses to repair instead of replacing, then each repair gives an extra year, so each year they can pay $40 to extend for one more year. So over four years, they would pay 4 * $40 = $160. But then, that would be compared to the new tires' cost of $180 over four years, so average cost per year is 45 vs 40. Then the difference would be 5, which is 12.5% more (5/40). But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nWait the problem says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.\" Hmm, maybe the question is considering that the customer can choose between buying new (which last four years) or repairing their current tires once (which gives one more year). But then comparing the average over those different periods. That would be an issue because the time periods are different. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the customer wants to have tires for four years and can choose between buying new (cost $180 for four years) or repairing the current tires four times (each year paying $40 to get one more year, so four repairs would cost 4*40 = $160). Then the average cost would be 180/4 vs 160/4, so 45 vs 40. The difference is 5, so 5/40 = 0.125, which is 12.5%, so answer C. But that's a possible approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the customer is choosing between replacing now (so new tires for four years) versus repairing once now to get one more year, so the repair gives one year, so over that one year, the cost is $40, so average per year is $40. Then comparing 180/4 =45 vs 40. The difference is 5, which is 5/40 = 12.5% higher. So that's the same as before. So in that case, the answer would be C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured so that the customer can choose between two options over the same time period. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the customer wants to have tires for four years. The options are:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now for $180, which will last four years. So cost per year: 180/4 =45.\n\nOption 2: Instead of buying new, repair the current tires each year. Each repair gives one more year. So over four years, you need four repairs. Each repair is $40, so total cost 4*40=160. So per year average cost is 160/4=40.\n\nThus, the difference between 45 and 40 is 5. The percentage increase from 40 to 45 is (5/40)*100 = 12.5%. So that would be option C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair is a one-time thing. For instance, if the current tires are already three years old (since they last four when new), then repairing them once would give one more year. So the total cost for the repair option would be $40, and the period is one year. Then comparing the average cost per year for new tires over four years (45) vs the repair option's average over one year (40). But that's comparing different periods, which might not be the right way. The question says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires\". So perhaps the comparison is over the same time period. Since the repair gives one year, but the new gives four, so maybe the comparison is per year over their respective lifetimes, and the question is asking for the percentage difference between those two averages. In that case, the average for new is 45, repair is 40. So 45 is (5/40)*100 =12.5% higher. So that would be answer C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the customer can choose to repair the tires multiple times. Like, if they repair them once, they get one more year. But if they want to have the tires for four years, they need to repair them four times, each time for a year. So total cost would be 4*40=160, so average is 40, as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me read again:\n\n\"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nWait, so the customer's options are either buy new (which last four years) or repair the current tires (which will make them last one more year). So the repair gives an extra year. So if the customer chooses to repair, the total lifespan after repair is one year? Or is it that the current tires, without repair, would have some remaining life, and the repair adds one more year? \n\nAh, here's the problem. The problem says \"the current tires... a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year\". So perhaps the current tires, without repair, would last for x years, but with the repair, they last x+1 years. But the problem doesn't state what x is. Since the tires are of the same brand and when new last four years, perhaps the current tires have been used for some time. For example, if the customer is at the point where the current tires have 1 year remaining, then repairing would extend it to 2 years. But since the problem doesn't specify, maybe the question is assuming that the customer is choosing between replacing the tires now (so getting four more years) versus repairing them once (to get one more year). In that case, the time periods are different, so perhaps the question is asking for the average annual cost over the period of the repair option (1 year) versus the new tires over their four years? But then comparing them directly might not be fair. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the customer is choosing between the two options for the same time span. Let's think of the customer wanting to have tires for four years. The options are:\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires now, costing $180, which will last four years. So total cost $180, average per year is 45.\n\nOption 2: Keep the current tires but repair them each year. Each repair gives one more year. To get four years, they would need four repairs. Each repair is $40, so total cost 4*40=160. Average per year is 40. \n\nThus, the average cost of new tires is 45, repair is 40. 45 is 5 more than 40. 5/40 is 0.125, so 12.5% higher. That would be answer C.\n\nAlternatively, if the customer only needs one more year, then the repair is better. But the question is asking for the average cost of the new tires compared to the repair. But the problem says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires\".\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured such that the customer can choose to repair the current tires multiple times. For instance, if they choose to repair instead of buying new, they can do it each year, so each year they pay $40 to get another year. Therefore, over four years, they pay 4*40=160, as above. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering only one repair. Like, the customer can choose between buying new (4 years) or repairing once (which gives one more year). Then the average cost of the new tires over four years is 45, and the repair option's average over one year is 40. Comparing those, but the periods are different. However, the question says \"average cost per year\", so perhaps each is calculated over their own lifetimes. So the question is, the average cost per year for the new tires (45) compared to the average cost per year for the repair option (40). So 45 is what percent greater than 40? The formula is ( (45 -40)/40 ) *100 = 12.5%. So that's answer C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me see the options. The answer choices include 12.5%, which is what I got. Let me check another way. Suppose the customer chooses to repair the current tires once, getting one more year. The cost is $40, so the average cost per year for that one year is 40. The new tires would have an average of 180/4 =45. So the increase from 40 to 45 is 12.5%, so that's correct. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but why would the problem mention that new tires last four years? Because if the customer chooses new, they get four years, but if they choose repair, they only get one more year. So the average cost per year for each option is over their own duration. The question is comparing those two averages. So the new's average is higher by that percentage. So yes, that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the customer can choose to repair multiple times to match the four-year lifespan. So for four years, you need four repairs, costing 4*40=160, which averages to 40. So the same as before. So the answer is 12.5%, so option C. \n\nI think that's the right way. The question is comparing the average annual costs over the lifespans of each option. Since the new tires last four years, their average is 180/4. The repair option, if done once, gives one year, so average is 40/1. But the problem might be considering the repair option as being extended over the same four years. But since the repair gives only one year, you have to do it every year. So the total cost over four years would be 4*40, hence average 40. \n\nTherefore, the percentage increase is (45-40)/40 *100 =12.5%. So the answer is C.\n",

So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage by which the average annual cost of new tires exceeds that of repairing current tires, we analyze both options:\n\n1. **New Tires**:  \n   - Cost: $180 per tire.  \n   - Lifespan: 4 years.  \n   - **Average annual cost**: $180 / 4 = $45 per year.\n\n2. **Repairing Current Tires**:  \n   - Cost: $40 per tire for one additional year.  \n   - To match the 4-year lifespan of new tires, the customer would need to repair the tires **four times** (once each year).  \n   - Total cost over 4 years: 4 \u00d7 $40 = $160.  \n   - **Average annual cost**: $160 / 4 = $40 per year.\n\n**Comparison**:  \nThe difference in average costs is $45 (new) \u2212 $40 (repair) = $5.  \nThe percentage increase is calculated as:  \n\\[\n\\frac{5}{40} \\times 100 = 12.5\\%.\n\\]\n\nAnswer: C)12.5%.\n\nAnswer: C",
