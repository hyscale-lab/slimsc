      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. Hmm, it's about partnership and profit sharing based on investments and time. Alright, let's start by breaking down the information given.\n\nSo, A starts with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then C joins later with Rs.120,000. The total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. We need to find how many months after B joined did C join. Wait, the question says \"how many months after B joined the business, did C join?\" So, B joined after 2 months from the start, so the time between B and C's entry is what we're looking for. Let me think in terms of time periods.\n\nFirst, let's note the time each person was in the business. Let me denote the total time as 12 months since it's a year. Let me assume that C joined 'x' months after B. But wait, maybe another way: Let's let the time from when A started be the reference. So A is in for the whole year, 12 months. B joined after 2 months, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait, no, actually, if the total period is 12 months, then B started at month 2, so their investment period is 10 months. Now, C joined after some more time after B. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me denote the time when C joined. Let me think of variables. Let's let t be the number of months after B joined that C joined. So, B started at 2 months, so C started at 2 + t months after the beginning. Therefore, C's time in the business would be 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months. Wait, no. Wait, total time is 12 months. So if C joined after, say, x months from the start, then their time is (12 - x) months. Alternatively, since B joined after 2 months, the time between B and C's entry would be (x - 2) months, but maybe that's complicating. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables differently. Let me think: Let\u2019s denote the time that C invested as 'm' months. Then, since the total time is 12 months, C must have joined after (12 - m) months from the start. But the question is asking how many months after B joined did C join. Since B joined after 2 months, so the time between B joining and C joining is (12 - m) - 2 = 10 - m months? Hmm, maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the standard way to calculate profit sharing in partnerships is based on the product of capital invested and the time period. So each partner's share is proportional to their capital multiplied by the time they were in the business.\n\nLet me set up the variables properly.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- A's investment: Rs.40,000 for 12 months.\n\n- B's investment: Rs.60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months? Wait, no. Wait, B joined after 2 months, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months. So yes, that's correct.\n\n- C's investment: Rs.120,000. Let's say C joined 't' months after the start. So C's time is (12 - t) months. But the question is asking how many months after B joined, so the time between B's entry (which was at 2 months) and C's entry is (t - 2) months. Wait, because if C joined at t months after the start, then the time between B (at 2) and C is (t - 2). But that's the value we need to find, right? So the answer is (t - 2). But let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can let the time after B joined when C joined be 'x' months. So, since B started at 2 months, then C started at 2 + x months. Therefore, C's time in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. \n\nSo now, let's compute the profit shares. The ratio of their investments multiplied by time will determine their profit shares.\n\nThe profit is divided in the ratio of their (capital * time).\n\nSo, A's share: 40000 * 12\n\nB's share: 60000 * 10 (since 10 months)\n\nC's share: 120000 * (10 - x)\n\nWait, let me confirm: C's time is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. Yes. So C's time is (10 - x) months.\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, so 40%. So maybe we can set up the ratio.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute the ratios of their contributions.\n\nLet me compute the ratio of A : B : C.\n\nA = 40000 *12 = 480000\n\nB = 60000 *10 = 600000\n\nC = 120000*(10 - x) = 120000*(10 -x)\n\nThe total ratio sum is (480000 + 600000 + 120000*(10 -x)) \n\nC's share over total profit is [120000*(10 -x)] / [480000 + 600000 + 120000*(10 -x)] = 150000 / 375000\n\nSimplify that equation.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nFirst, let me note that 150000 / 375000 = 0.4 = 2/5.\n\nSo:\n\n[120000*(10 -x)] / [ (480000 + 600000) + 120000*(10 -x) ) ] = 2/5\n\nLet me compute the denominator's first part:\n\n480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000.\n\nSo denominator is 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -x)\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\n120000*(10 -x) / [1080000 + 120000*(10 -x)] = 2/5\n\nCross multiplying:\n\n5 * 120000*(10 -x) = 2 * [1080000 + 120000*(10 -x)]\n\nLet me compute left side: 600000*(10 -x)\n\nRight side: 2*1080000 + 2*120000*(10 -x) = 2,160,000 + 240,000*(10 -x)\n\nSo equation:\n\n600,000*(10 -x) = 2,160,000 + 240,000*(10 -x)\n\nLet me subtract 240,000*(10 -x) from both sides:\n\n600,000*(10 -x) -240,000*(10 -x) = 2,160,000\n\nFactor out (10 -x):\n\n(600,000 -240,000)*(10 -x) = 2,160,000\n\n360,000*(10 -x) = 2,160,000\n\nDivide both sides by 360,000:\n\n10 - x = 2,160,000 / 360,000\n\nCalculate that: 2,160,000 divided by 360,000 is 6.\n\nSo 10 -x =6 \u2192 x=10-6=4.\n\nWait, so x is 4? Then, since x is the time after B joined when C joined, so the answer is 4 months? Which is option B. But let me check my steps again to be sure.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculations step by step. Let me go back to the equation:\n\nAfter cross multiplying:\n\n5 * 120000*(10 -x) = 2*(1,080,000 + 120000*(10 -x))\n\nLeft side: 5*120,000 = 600,000 \u2192 600,000*(10 -x)\n\nRight side: 2*1,080,000 is 2,160,000. Then 2*120,000*(10-x) is 240,000*(10-x). So yes, that's correct.\n\nSubtracting 240k*(10-x) from both sides gives:\n\nLeft: 600k -240k = 360k. So 360,000*(10-x) = 2,160,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 360,000:\n\n10 -x = 2,160,000 / 360,000 \u2192 6. So 10-6 =4. So x=4. So that's 4 months after B joined. So the answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the total. Let's plug back x=4 into the variables.\n\nC's time would be 10 -x =6 months. So C was in for 6 months. So his investment period is 6 months. Let me compute the ratios again.\n\nA:40,000 *12 =480,000\n\nB:60,000 *10=600,000\n\nC:120,000 *6=720,000\n\nTotal ratio sum is 480k +600k +720k = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share ratio is 720,000 / 1,800,000 = 0.4, which is 40%, and the total profit is 375,000. 40% of 375,000 is 150,000. Which matches the given data. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)4 months.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we calculate the profit shares based on the product of each partner's investment and their time in the business. \n\n- **A's investment**: Rs.40,000 for 12 months \u2192 \\(40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000\\)\n- **B's investment**: Rs.60,000 for 10 months (joined after 2 months) \u2192 \\(60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000\\)\n- **C's investment**: Rs.120,000 for \\((12 - (2 + x))\\) months, where \\(x\\) is the time after B joined.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so it's about partnership and profit sharing. The question is asking how many months after B joined, C joined the business. Let me parse the details again.\n\nA starts with Rs.40,000. Then B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000. Then C joins after some more time, which we need to find. The total profit at the end of the year (which I assume is 12 months) is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So I need to find the time when C joined relative to B's entry.\n\nFirst, profit sharing in partnerships is usually based on the product of the capital invested and the time period for which it was invested. The formula is typically (Capital \u00d7 Time) for each partner, and then the ratio of these products determines their share of the profit.\n\nLet me note down the variables. Let\u2019s let the time after B joined that C joined be 'x' months. Wait, actually, the question says \"how many months after B joined did C join?\" So B joined after 2 months from the start. Let me see.\n\nLet me structure the timeline:\n\n- A starts at time 0 (month 0) with 40,000. So A's total time is 12 months.\n\n- B joins after 2 months, so starts at month 2, so B's time in the business is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait, no, the total time is 12 months from the start. So if B starts at month 2, they have been in for 10 months by the end of the year. \n\nBut then C joined after some more time. Let me denote the time between B joining and C joining as 'x' months. Wait, actually, the problem states \"after some more time\" after B joined. So C's joining time is 2 + x months after A started. So the time that C invested would be (12 - (2 + x)) months? Wait, let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to set variables in terms of months each was involved.\n\nLet me denote the time when C joined as 't' months after the start. Since B joined after 2 months, so C must have joined after more than 2 months. The time between B joining (at 2 months) and C joining would be (t - 2) months. But the question asks how many months after B joined did C join, which would be (t - 2) months. So our target variable is (t - 2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let's let the time between when B joined and when C joined be 'x' months. So C joined x months after B. Therefore, C's starting time is 2 + x months after A started. Then, the time each partner was in the business is:\n\nA: 12 months.\n\nB: 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait no, B started at 2 months, so total time is 12 - 2 = 10 months. \n\nC started at (2 + x) months, so his time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Wait, that might not be right. Wait, if C started at month (2 + x), then the time from the start until the end is 12 months, so the duration C was in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So yes.\n\nNow, the profit shares are in proportion to their capital multiplied by time.\n\nSo let's compute each partner's capital multiplied by their time.\n\nA's contribution: 40,000 * 12.\n\nB's contribution: 60,000 * 10.\n\nC's contribution: 120,000 * (10 - x). \n\nThe total profit is divided according to these ratios. \n\nGiven that C's share is 150,000 out of 375,000 total. Let's see, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4. So C's share is 40% of the total profit. \n\nAlternatively, the ratio of C's contribution to the total contributions should be equal to 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4. \n\nSo let's set up the ratios. Let me write the contributions:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = 40000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB = 60000 * 10 = 600,000\n\nC = 120000 * (10 - x) = 1,200,000 - 120000x\n\nTotal = A + B + C = 480,000 + 600,000 + (1,200,000 - 120,000x) \n\nWait, adding those up: 480k + 600k = 1,080,000. Then adding 1.2 million minus 120k x gives total = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if x is the months after B joined that C joined, then the total contributions would depend on x. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the ratio of C's contribution to the total contributions equals his share of the profit. So:\n\nC's ratio = (C's cap*time) / (Total cap*time) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nLet me write that equation.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nA: 40000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60000 * (12 - 2) = 60000 *10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120000 * (12 - t), where t is the time when C joined (in months since start). Wait, maybe I need to re-define variables here. Let me try again.\n\nWait perhaps the confusion comes from variable definitions. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say that C joined after 'm' months from the start. Since B joined after 2 months, the time between B and C joining is (m - 2) months. The question asks for how many months after B joined did C join, so that would be (m - 2) months. We need to find (m - 2).\n\nC's time in the business is (12 - m) months because he started at month m, so from m to 12 is 12 - m months.\n\nSo the capital contributions multiplied by time are:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\n\nB: 60,000 * (12 - 2) = 60,000 *10\n\nC: 120,000 * (12 - m)\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So the ratio of C's contribution to the total contributions should be equal to 150k / 375k = 0.4.\n\nSo:\n\n[120,000*(12 - m)] / [40,000*12 + 60,000*10 + 120,000*(12 - m)] = 150,000 / 375,000\n\nLet me compute the denominator first. Let's compute each term:\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60,000*10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120,000*(12 - m) \n\nSo total = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - m) \n\n= 1,080,000 + 120,000*(12 - m)\n\nSo the equation is:\n\n120,000*(12 - m) / [1,080,000 + 120,000*(12 - m)] = 0.4\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote X = 120,000*(12 - m). Then the equation becomes:\n\nX / (1,080,000 + X) = 0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nX = 0.4*(1,080,000 + X)\n\nX = 432,000 + 0.4X\n\nSubtract 0.4X from both sides:\n\n0.6X = 432,000\n\nX = 432,000 / 0.6 = 720,000\n\nBut X is 120,000*(12 - m) = 720,000\n\nSo 120,000*(12 - m) = 720,000\n\nDivide both sides by 120,000:\n\n12 - m = 720,000 / 120,000 = 6\n\nSo 12 - m =6 \u2192 m = 12 -6 =6\n\nSo m is 6. That means C joined at 6 months from the start. Since B joined after 2 months, the time between B and C joining is 6 -2 =4 months. So the answer should be 4 months, which is option B.\n\nWait let me check again.\n\nWait so m is the time when C joined (months from start). So 6 months after start, so he was in for 12-6=6 months. Let me check the calculations again.\n\nLet me re-calculate the ratio with m=6:\n\nC's contribution: 120,000 *6 =720,000\n\nTotal contributions:\n\nA: 480,000\n\nB: 600,000\n\nC:720,000\n\nTotal is 1,800,000.\n\nC's share is 720,000 /1,800,000 = 0.4, which is 40%, and the total profit is 375,000, so 40% of that is 150,000, which matches the given data. So yes, that works.\n\nTherefore the time between B joining (month 2) and C joining (month6) is 4 months. So the correct answer is B)4 months.\n\nWait the options are A)2, B)4, C)23, D)24, E)84. So B is the correct answer. \n\nHmm, but let me check if I made a mistake in the setup. Let me see. The time for C is 12 - m, where m is when he joined. So if he joined at 6 months, his time is 6 months. So yes. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think: the ratio of their capitals multiplied by time.\n\nLet me try another approach. The profit shares are in proportion to their (capital \u00d7 time). So:\n\nLet\u2019s compute the ratio of C's share to total profit is 150,000 / 375,000 = 1/2.5 = 0.4. So the ratio of C's investment-time product to the total is 0.4.\n\nSo:\n\nC's (capital \u00d7 time) / (A's + B's + C's) = 0.4\n\nLet me compute each term again.\n\nA: 40,000 \u00d7 12 = 480,000\n\nB:60,000 \u00d710=600,000\n\nC:120,000 \u00d7 t, where t is the number of months C was in. \n\nTotal = 480k +600k +120,000t = 1,080,000 +120,000t\n\nC's ratio: (120,000t)/(1,080,000 +120,000t) = 0.4\n\nSame equation as before. Solving:\n\n120,000t = 0.4*(1,080,000 +120,000t)\n\n120,000t = 432,000 +48,000t\n\n120,000t -48,000t =432,000 \u2192 72,000t =432,000 \u2192 t=6 months. \n\nSo C was in for 6 months. Since the total time is 12 months, he joined at 12 -6=6 months after start. So between B (who joined at 2 months) and C is 6-2=4 months. So yes, answer B.\n\nI think that's solid. So the answer must be B.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so it's about partnership and profit sharing. The question is asking how many months after B joined, C joined the business. Let me parse the details again.\n\nA starts with Rs.40,000. Then B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000. Then C joins after some more time, which we need to find. The total profit at the end of the year (which I assume is 12 months) is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So I need to find the time when C joined relative to B's entry.\n\nFirst, profit sharing in partnerships is usually based on the product of the capital invested and the time period for which it was invested. The formula is typically (Capital \u00d7 Time) for each partner, and then the ratio of these products determines their share of the profit.\n\nLet me note down the variables. Let\u2019s let the time after B joined that C joined be 'x' months. Wait, actually, the question says \"how many months after B joined did C join?\" So B joined after 2 months from the start. Let me see.\n\nLet me structure the timeline:\n\n- A starts at time 0 (month 0) with 40,000. So A's total time is 12 months.\n\n- B joins after 2 months, so starts at month 2, so B's time in the business is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait, no, the total time is 12 months from the start. So if B starts at month 2, they have been in for 10 months by the end of the year. \n\nBut then C joined after some more time. Let me denote the time between B joining and C joining as 'x' months. Wait, actually, the problem states \"after some more time\" after B joined. So C's joining time is 2 + x months after A started. So the time that C invested would be (12 - (2 + x)) months? Wait, let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to set variables in terms of months each was involved.\n\nLet me denote the time when C joined as 't' months after the start. Since B joined after 2 months, so C must have joined after more than 2 months. The time between B joining (at 2 months) and C joining would be (t - 2) months. But the question asks how many months after B joined did C join, which would be (t - 2) months. So our target variable is (t - 2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let's let the time between when B joined and when C joined be 'x' months. So C joined x months after B. Therefore, C's starting time is 2 + x months after A started. Then, the time each partner was in the business is:\n\nA: 12 months.\n\nB: 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait no, B started at 2 months, so total time is 12 - 2 = 10 months. \n\nC started at (2 + x) months, so his time is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Wait, that might not be right. Wait, if C started at month (2 + x), then the time from the start until the end is 12 months, so the duration C was in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So yes.\n\nNow, the profit shares are in proportion to their capital multiplied by time.\n\nSo let's compute each partner's capital multiplied by their time.\n\nA's contribution: 40,000 * 12.\n\nB's contribution: 60,000 * 10.\n\nC's contribution: 120,000 * (10 - x). \n\nThe total profit is divided according to these ratios. \n\nGiven that C's share is 150,000 out of 375,000 total. Let's see, the ratio of C's share to the total is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4. So C's share is 40% of the total profit. \n\nAlternatively, the ratio of C's contribution to the total contributions should be equal to 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4. \n\nSo let's set up the ratios.

Then adding 1.2 million minus 120k x gives total = 2,280,000 - 120,000x.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because if x is the months after B joined that C joined, then the total contributions would depend on x. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the ratio of C's contribution to the total contributions equals his share of the profit. So:\n\nC's ratio = (C's cap*time) / (Total cap*time) = 150,000 / 375,000.\n\nLet me write that equation.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nA: 40000 * 12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60000 * (12 - 2) = 60000 *10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120000 * (12 - t), where t is the time when C joined (in months since start).
