      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about converting marks from one maximum scale to another. Hmm, the candidate got 504 out of M, and when they convert the maximum M to 800, his score becomes 420. So I need to find M.\n\nWait, how does the conversion work here? Like, maybe it's proportional? Like if you have a percentage, then when you change the maximum, the new mark is the same percentage of the new maximum. So maybe the idea is that 504/M equals 420/800?\n\nOh right! Because if the percentage is the same, then (obtained/original max) = (new obtained/new max). So setting up the equation 504/M = 420/800. Then solving for M. Let me check that.\n\nSo cross-multiplying: 504 * 800 = 420 * M. Then M would be (504 *800)/420. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, simplify 504 divided by 420. Let's see, both numbers are divisible by 84 maybe? 504 divided by 84 is 6, and 420 divided by 84 is 5. So 504/420 = 6/5. So then the equation becomes M = (6/5)*800. Because (504/420)*800 = (6/5)*800. \n\nCalculating 6/5 of 800: 800 divided by 5 is 160, multiplied by 6 gives 960. So M would be 960? Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. \n\nAlternatively, 504 *800 = 403200. Then divide that by 420. Let me do 403200 divided by 420. \n\nHmm, maybe divide numerator and denominator by 10 first to get 40320 /42. Then 40320 divided by 42. Let's see, 42 * 960 = 40,320. Because 42*900=37800, 42*60=2520. 37800+2520=40320. So yes, that gives 960. So M is 960. \n\nLooking at the options, option E is 960. So the answer should be E. Let me check again the problem to make sure I didn't misread anything.\n\nThe question states that when the maximum M is converted into 800, he would have secured 420. So the percentage is the same. So yes, the proportion holds. So yeah, 960 is the right answer. The options given include E)960. So I think that's correct.\n",

Then solve for M. Let's do the math.\n\nFirst, divide both sides by 800: 504/M = 420 / 800. Let me calculate 420 divided by 800. That's 0.525. So 504 divided by M equals 0.525. Then M = 504 / 0.525. Let me compute that.\n\nHmm, 504 divided by 0.525. Let me think. 0.525 is the same as 21/40, right? Because 21 divided by 40 is 0.525. Wait, 21*4=84, so 21/40 is 0.525. So 504 divided by (21/40) is 504 * (40/21). Let me compute that.\n\nBreaking it down: 504 divided by 21 first. 21 times 24 is 504 (since 20*21=420, plus 4*21=84, total 504). So 504/21 is 24.
