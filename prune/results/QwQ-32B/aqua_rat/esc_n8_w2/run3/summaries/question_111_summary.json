      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about percentages of employees taking winter and summer vacations. I need to find out what percentage take a summer vacation but not winter. Alright, let me jot down the given info first.\n\nFirst, 75% take a winter vacation. Then, 40% take both winter and summer. And 20% take neither. The question is asking for the percentage that takes summer but not winter. \n\nHmm, this sounds like a set theory problem, maybe using a Venn diagram with two circles: one for winter and one for summer. Let me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The total percentage of employees taking either winter or summer vacation would be the sum of those taking winter and those taking summer, minus those taking both. But since 20% take neither, that means 80% take at least one of the vacations. \n\nLet me write that down. Let W be winter, S be summer. \n\nTotal taking either: W \u222a S = 100% - 20% = 80%. \n\nThe formula for union is W + S - (W \u2229 S) = 80%. \n\nWe know W is 75%, and W \u2229 S is 40%. Plugging those in:\n\n75% + S - 40% = 80%. \n\nSo that simplifies to (75 -40) + S = 80 \u2192 35% + S =80% \u2192 S = 45%. Wait, so the total percentage taking summer is 45%? But the question is asking for those who take summer but not winter. \n\nRight, because the 40% is the overlap. So the summer only group would be total summer minus both. So 45% total summer minus 40% both equals 5%? But wait, that would give 5%, which is option A. But let me check again because maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me go through again. \n\nTotal in W is 75. Both are 40. So the percentage who take only winter is 75 -40 =35. \n\nTotal in S is what we found as 45, so only summer is 45 -40 =5. \n\nBut then 35 (only W) +40 (both) +5 (only S) =80, plus the 20 neither, which adds up to 100. That checks out. \n\nHmm, so the answer would be 5%, which is option A. But wait, that seems low. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe I messed up the inclusion part. Let me re-calculate the S. \n\nSo, using the formula:\n\nW + S - both = total in either. \n\n75 + S - 40 = 80 \u2192 75 -40 is 35, so 35 + S =80? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, 75 + S minus 40 equals 80. \n\nSo 75 + S = 80 +40 \u2192 75 + S = 120 \u2192 S =45. Yeah that's correct. \n\nSo the summer only is 45-40=5. So yes, answer A. But let me see if the options have 5. Option A is 5, so that's the choice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use a table. Let's see. \n\nTotal employees: let's assume 100 people for simplicity. \n\n75 take winter. 40 take both. 20 take neither. \n\nSo the number taking at least one is 80. \n\nSo the number taking only winter is 75 total winter minus 40 both =35. \n\nThe number taking only summer would be total in either (80) minus only winter (35) minus both (40) \u2192 80-35-40=5. \n\nSo that's 5, which is 5% of 100. So yes, 5% is the answer. So option A. \n\nHmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake because 5% seems really low. Let me check the problem again. The question is asking for summer but not winter. So yes, that's the only summer part. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the numbers again. \n\nThe problem says 40% take both. So that's correct. 75% winter. \n\nYes, so the calculation seems right. I think the answer is A)5%.\n",

The total percentage taking either winter or summer or both would be 100% minus those who take neither.

Let me write that equation out. \n\n80 = 75 + P(S) - 40. Wait, because 40% is the both. So solving for P(S): \n\n75 + P(S) -40 =80. So 35 + P(S) =80. So P(S) is 45%? Wait, but that would be the total percentage taking summer.

But total summer is ?\n\nTotal in either is 80 (since neither is 20). So the sum of winter only (35), summer only (let's say x), and both (40) should equal 80. \n\n35 +40 +x =80 \u2192 75 +x =80 \u2192 x=5. So summer only is 5%, which matches the first calculation. So the answer would be 5%, which is option A. \n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive. If 40% take both, and only 5% take summer alone, that's possible?
