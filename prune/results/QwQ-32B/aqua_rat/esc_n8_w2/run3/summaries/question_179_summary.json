      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around a rectangular plot. The perimeter of the plot is given as 340 meters, and the rate is 10 per square meter. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the question is about finding the area of the boundary, right? Because the cost depends on the area. Since it's a rectangular plot, the boundary is like a path around it that's 1 meter wide. \n\nWait, the perimeter of the rectangle itself is 340 meters. But to find the area of the boundary, I might need the dimensions of the rectangle. Because the area of the boundary would be the area of the larger rectangle (including the boundary) minus the area of the original plot. \n\nLet me denote the length and width of the original plot as L and W. The perimeter is 2(L + W) = 340, so L + W = 170. But without knowing L and W individually, can I find the area of the boundary?\n\nThe boundary is 1 meter wide around the entire plot. So the larger rectangle (including the boundary) would have a length of L + 2 meters (since 1 meter on each side) and a width of W + 2 meters. Therefore, the area of the larger rectangle is (L+2)(W+2). The original area is L*W. The boundary area is (L+2)(W+2) - L*W. \n\nLet me compute that: expanding (L+2)(W+2) gives L*W + 2L + 2W +4. Subtract L*W, so the boundary area is 2L + 2W +4. Which simplifies to 2(L + W) +4. Since L + W is 170, this would be 2*170 +4 = 340 +4 = 344. \n\nOh! Wait a second. So the area of the boundary is 344 square meters. Then the cost would be 344 *10 = 3440. So the answer would be C)3440. \n\nBut wait, let me check again. Because sometimes when you have a path around a rectangle, you have to make sure that the calculation is correct. Let me verify the steps once more.\n\nOriginal perimeter is 2(L + W)=340 \u2192 L+W=170. The boundary is 1m wide. The area of the path is ( (L+2)(W+2) - L*W ). Expanding that gives indeed 2L + 2W +4. So substituting L+W=170, 2(L+W) is 340, plus 4 gives 344. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the cost would be 344 *10 = 3440, which is option C. \n\nWait, but the options given are A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None. So C is an option. So the correct answer should be C. \n\nBut hold on, is there any chance that I made a mistake in the area calculation? Let me think again. Suppose the plot is L by W, the path is 1m around, so the outer dimensions are L+2 and W+2. So the area difference is (L+2)(W+2) - L*W = 2L + 2W +4. Since the perimeter is 2(L+W) =340, so L+W is 170. Therefore, 2(L+W) is 340. So 340 +4=344. That's right. \n\nHmm, so then the area is 344, so cost 3440. Option C is the answer. So why is there an option D) Cannot be determined? Maybe someone might think that since the rectangle could have different length and width but same perimeter, but in this calculation, the area of the path only depends on the perimeter. Since L+W is fixed, the 2(L+W) term is fixed, so the area of the path is fixed. Therefore, it can be determined. So the answer is C. So I think the answer is C. Therefore the correct option is C)3440.\n",

The perimeter of the plot is given as 340 meters, and the rate is 10 per square meter. The options are A to E, with D being \"Cannot be determined\" and E \"None of these.\" Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the area of the boundary, right? Because the cost depends on the area. The boundary is 1 meter wide around the rectangle. Wait, how do I find the area of just that boundary?\n\nLet me recall, the perimeter of the rectangle is 340 meters. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). But since we don't know the individual length and width, maybe I need another approach here. Because if I can find the area of the boundary, then multiply by the rate, that would give the cost.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might require knowing the area of the path (the boundary) which is like a walkway around the rectangle. To find that area, I think you subtract the area of the inner rectangle from the outer one. The outer rectangle would be the original plot plus the 1m border on all sides. Wait, but how much bigger is the outer rectangle?\n\nLet me think: suppose the original plot has length L and width W. Then the perimeter is 2(L + W) = 340, so L + W = 170 meters. That's given.\n\nNow, the garden boundary is 1m wide around the plot. So the area of the boundary (the path) would be the area of the larger rectangle (original plus the path) minus the area of the original plot.\n\nThe larger rectangle's dimensions would be (L + 2*1) meters in length and (W + 2*1) meters in width. Because the path is on both sides. So the area of the larger rectangle is (L + 2)(W + 2). The original area is L*W. The area of the path is then (L+2)(W+2) - L*W. Let me expand that:\n\n(L + 2)(W + 2) = L*W + 2L + 2W +4. Subtract L*W, so the path area is 2L + 2W +4.\n\nHmm, that simplifies to 2(L + W) +4. But we know L + W is 170 from the perimeter. So substituting, that would be 2*170 +4 = 340 +4 = 344. \n\nSo the area of the path is 344 square meters. Then, multiplying by the rate of 10 per square meter gives 344 *10 = 3440. So the cost would be 3440, which is option C. Wait, but let me double-check that because I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again. The area of the path is ( (L+2)(W+2) - LW ) = 2L + 2W +4. Since L + W =170, then 2(L+W) is 340, plus 4 gives 344. So that's correct. Then 344*10 is indeed 3440. So the answer would be option C? But let me check the options given. The options are A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these.\n\nHmm, so C is an option here. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, is there a different way to approach this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me. Let me think again. Suppose the boundary is 1 meter broad, so when you go around the rectangle, the area would be perimeter multiplied by the width minus the corners? Wait, because when you have a path around a rectangle, the area can be thought of as the perimeter times the width, but subtract the overlapping corners which are counted twice. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, the area of the path is perimeter * width of path minus (width^2)*4. Because each corner is a square of 1x1 here, but since the path is on all sides, maybe?\n\nWait, let's see: The formula for the area of a path around a rectangle is indeed (2*(L + W)*width) + (4*width^2) ? Or maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the area can be considered as two parts: the two lengths and two widths. For the length sides: each has a rectangle of length L and width 1, but there are two of them, but also the ends would have the width parts. Wait, maybe this complicates.\n\nAlternatively, the formula I used before is correct. Let me confirm again with variables. Suppose L and W are the original length and width. The path is 1 m wide, so the outer rectangle is L+2 and W+2. The area difference is (L+2)(W+2) - L*W = 2L + 2W +4, which is indeed 2*(L+W) +4. Since L+W=170, that gives 340 +4 = 344. So that's correct. Therefore, 344 *10 = 3440, so answer C. But let me check the options again. The options have C as 3440, which matches. So that's the answer?\n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something here. Because the problem states \"the cost of gardening 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres\". But wait, maybe there's a mistake in the calculation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the perimeter is 340, but the area calculation depends on the actual dimensions. Wait, but in my calculation, I didn't need the actual L and W, only their sum. Because L + W is 170, so 2(L+W) is 340, plus 4 gives 344. So that's why it works.\n\nWait, so then the area can be determined even without knowing the exact length and width. So the answer should be C)3440, which is option C. So then the correct answer is C. But let me check again.\n\nWait another way: Let me take an example. Suppose the rectangle is a square. Let's say L = W. Then since perimeter is 340, each side would be 340/4 = 85 meters. Then the area of the path would be (85+2)^2 - (85)^2 = (87^2 -85^2). That's (87-85)(87+85) = 2*(172) = 344. Exactly. So that's 344. So the area is indeed 344, so the cost is 3440. So that's correct. So the answer is C.\n\nBut wait, the options have E as \"None of these.\" Wait, but 3440 is option C. So the answer is C, so that's correct. But why is there an option D? Maybe I made a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the boundary being 1 meter broad, but the path is only on the inside? Or maybe the question is ambiguous. Wait, but the problem says \"boundary around\" which would be an outer path. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question. Wait, perhaps the area can't be determined because the plot could be of different dimensions with the same perimeter but different areas. But in the calculation above, the area of the path only depends on the perimeter, not the individual L and W. Because 2(L + W) +4 is exactly 2*(perimeter/2) +4. Because perimeter is 2(L+W). So substituting, 2*(170) +4 = 344. So it's actually possible to compute without knowing L and W individually. So the area can be determined. So the answer is C, which is an option, so the answer should be C. So the correct answer is C.\n",

The area of this path can be calculated by subtracting the area of the original plot from the area of the larger rectangle (including the path):\n   - The larger rectangle's dimensions are \\( (L + 2) \\times (W + 2) \\) (adding 1 meter to each side).\n   - The area difference is:\n     \\[\n     (L + 2)(W + 2) - LW = 2L + 2W + 4\n     \\]\n   - Substituting \\( L + W = 170 \\):\n     \\[\n     2(L + W) + 4 = 2(170) + 4 = 340 + 4 = 344 \\text{ square meters}.\n     \\]\n\n3. **Cost Calculation**: Multiply the area by the rate (\u20b910 per square meter):\n   \\[\n   344 \\times 10 = 3440.\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verification with Example**: Testing with a square plot (each side 85 meters, since \\( 4 \\times 85 = 340 \\)):\n   - Path area: \\( (87 \\times 87) - (85 \\times 85) = 7569 - 7225 = 344 \\), confirming the calculation.\n\nSince the area can be determined using the given perimeter, the correct answer is **C) 3440**.\n\nAnswer: C",
