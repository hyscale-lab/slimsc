      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem says when I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I'm 60, how old is he? Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, when the person was 2, their brother was half their age. So half of 2 is 1. That means the brother was 1 year old when the person was 2. So the age difference between them is 2 - 1 = 1 year? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the brother being half the age would mean that when the person was 2, brother's age was 1. So the brother is one year younger? Because the difference is 1 year.\n\nWait, but let me think again. If someone is half your age, then the age difference is your age minus theirs, which would be 2 - 1 = 1. So the brother is 1 year younger. So now, when the person is 60, the brother would be 60 -1 = 59? That would be option A)59. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Let's say when the person was 2, the brother was half as old. So brother's age then was 1. The time that has passed since then until now is the person's current age minus their age then. The person is now 60, so that's 60 -2 = 58 years have passed. So the brother's current age would be 1 +58 = 59. Yeah that seems right. So the answer should be 59, which is option A. But wait, hold on. Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nWait, if the brother was half the age when the person was 2, then the age difference is 1 year. So the brother is always 1 year younger. So when the person is 60, brother is 59. That makes sense. But sometimes these problems can trick you. Let me think of another example. Like, when the person is 4, the brother would be 3, right? Because he's half the age at 2, so 1, then each year they both get older. So the difference is always 1. So yeah, 60 minus 1 is 59. So answer A. \n\nHmm, but why are the options going up to 99? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. \"When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age.\" So that's when the speaker was 2, brother was 1. So the brother is 1 year younger. Now, the speaker is 60, so brother is 59. So the answer must be A. The other options are way higher. Wait, maybe I misread the question. Did it say the brother was half my age now? No, the question says when I was 2, so that's the key point. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the brother was half the age difference? Wait no, the wording is straightforward. \"half my age\" at that time. So when the speaker was 2, brother was 1. So the age difference is 1. So now, when the speaker is 60, the brother is 59. So the correct answer is A. The options given include A as 59, so that's the right choice.\n",
