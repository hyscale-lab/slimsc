      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So the question is about finding the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom night or the debating session. Hmm, right, it's like those inclusion-exclusion problems. \n\nFirst, the school has 200 students. The problem states that at least 45% attended the prom and at least 35% participated in the debate. Wait, \"at least\" means those are the minimum percentages, right? So the actual number of students attending each event could be higher, but the question is asking for the maximum number who didn't go to either. To maximize the number of students who missed both, I need to minimize the number who attended at least one of the events. \n\nSo the idea is to find the minimal possible overlap between the two groups. Because if more students are in both events, the total attending at least one is higher, leaving fewer who didn't attend either. But to maximize the non-attendees, I need the minimal total attendees. \n\nLet me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula is:\n\nTotal in A or B = A + B - (A and B)\n\nBut since we're dealing with minimums, maybe I should think in terms of how to make the overlap as large as possible? Wait, wait. Let me think again. To minimize the total number of students who went to either event, we need to maximize the overlap between the two groups. Because the more overlap there is, the fewer total students are accounted for. \n\nOh right, exactly. Because if a lot of students went to both events, then the total number attending at least one is smaller, which leaves more students outside. \n\nSo the problem is to find the minimal possible number of students who attended at least one event, given that the prom had at least 45% and the debate at least 35%. \n\nLet me calculate the minimum percentages first. 45% of 200 is 90 students (since 200 * 0.45 = 90). Similarly, 35% of 200 is 70 students. \n\nSo the minimum number of students who went to prom is 90, and to debate is 70. To find the minimal total attendees, we need to maximize the overlap between these two groups. The maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two groups. Wait, because if all the debate attendees also went to the prom, then the overlap is 70, which is the size of the debate group. \n\nSo the minimal total would be 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if all 70 debate attendees also went to the prom, then the total number of students who went to either is 90. So the maximum possible overlap here would mean the total is 90. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of students attending either event is 90. Therefore, the maximum number who didn't attend either would be 200 - 90 = 110? But wait, 110 is one of the options (E). But that seems high. Let me check again.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think through this again. \n\nThe formula for the minimal total is A + B - maximum possible overlap. The maximum overlap can't exceed the size of the smaller set. Since the debate has 70 and prom has 90, the maximum overlap possible is 70 (all debate attendees also went to the prom). So the total is 90 +70 -70=90. \n\nSo yes, that would mean the minimal number of students who went to at least one is 90, so the maximum who didn't go to either is 200-90=110. But wait, the options include E) 110, but the problem says \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% took part in the debate.\" So if we take exactly 45% (90) and exactly 35% (70), and maximize their overlap, then that gives the minimal total. \n\nBut wait, what if the actual numbers are higher? Like, suppose more than 45% went to the prom, then maybe the overlap could be even larger? But no, since we're trying to find the maximum possible number of students who didn't attend either, so we want the minimal possible total attendees, so we have to take the minimal numbers for each (45% and 35%), because if you take more, that would require more students, leading to higher total attendees. \n\nSo the minimal possible total attendees is indeed 90. Therefore, the maximum number who didn't attend either is 110. But wait, the options include E) 110. But why is there an option A)27, B)81, etc.? Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that \"at least\" means that the actual numbers can't be less than those, so the minimal number attending prom is 90, minimal debate 70. To get the minimal total attendees, the overlap is as large as possible, so the total is 90 +70 - x, where x is as big as possible. The maximum x can be is 70 (since the debate group is 70, so all of them could be in the prom group). So the total would be 90 +70 -70 =90. \n\nSo that gives 200-90=110. So the answer would be E. But the problem is, sometimes in these questions, they might consider that the percentages can't be exactly met but have to be integers. Wait, but 45% of 200 is exactly 90, and 35% is 70. So that's okay. \n\nHmm, but maybe I'm missing something here. Let me see the options again. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. So 110 is an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick where \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% took part in the debate\", so the minimal possible number of students who went to either is 90 (prom) +70 (debate) - 200 (if possible?), but that can't be. Wait, no, inclusion-exclusion formula can't give a negative. \n\nWait, perhaps another way to think: To maximize the number of students who didn't attend either, we need to minimize the number who attended at least one. \n\nThe minimal number of students who attended at least one is (A + B - total). Wait, no. Let me think of it as the minimal possible A + B - overlap. Wait, to minimize the total, maximize the overlap. \n\nYes, so the minimal total is A + B - overlap_max. \n\nSo overlap_max is the minimum of A and B. Since B (debate) is 70, which is less than A (90), so overlap_max is 70. So total is 90 +70 -70 =90. \n\nThus, the maximum number not attending either is 200 -90 =110. \n\nHmm, but maybe the question is worded differently. Wait, the question says \"at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session.\" So the minimum possible for prom is 45%, so 90 students. The minimum for debate is 35%, so 70 students. \n\nThus, when we set both to their minimums, the overlap can be as high as possible, leading to the minimal total attendees. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be E)110. \n\nBut wait, the options have E as 110. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think that the question is in percentages. Let me recast the problem in terms of percentages. \n\nTotal students 200. \n\nThe minimum percentages are 45% prom, 35% debate. \n\nWe want the maximum percentage who didn't attend either. \n\nThe maximum possible non-attendees would be 100% - (45% +35% - overlap%). \n\nThe overlap can be at maximum 35% (since debate is 35%, so all of them could have gone to prom). So the minimum total attendance is 45% +35% -35% =45%. \n\nTherefore, the maximum non-attendees is 100% -45% =55%. 55% of 200 is 110. So that's the same as before. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be E)110. \n\nBut I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, there's a catch. Let me see the options again. The options include 110, so that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think that the problem states \"at least 45% attended the prom\" so the number could be higher, but to maximize the non-attendees, we set the prom and debate to their minimums. So yes, the answer is E. \n\nHmm. I think that's right. So the answer is E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about finding the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom or the debating session. Let me try to think through this step by step. \n\nFirst, the school has 200 students total. The question says at least 45% attended the prom and at least 35% took part in the debating session. We need to find the maximum possible number who didn't go to either. Hmm, right, maximum number of non-attendees. \n\nWait, the key here is that \"at least\" percentages are given. So for the prom, the minimum number attending is 45%, which is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. Similarly, the debating session had at least 35%, so that's 0.35 * 200 = 70 students. But the question is asking for the maximum number who didn't attend either. To maximize the number of students who didn't attend either event, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of them. \n\nOh right, because the total students not in either is total minus those who attended at least one. So to maximize the non-attendees, the attendees (prom or debate) should be as small as possible. \n\nThe formula here would be: the number who attended prom OR debate is at least (45% + 35%) of 200, but since there could be overlap, the minimum possible total attendees would be when the overlap is as large as possible. Wait, let me think again. \n\nThe minimum possible number of students attending at least one event is equal to the sum of the minimums minus the maximum possible overlap. Wait, maybe I should recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. \n\nThe formula is: |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. To minimize the total number of students in A \u222a B, we need to maximize the overlap (the intersection). \n\nSo since the minimum number of prom attendees is 90 and debate is 70, the maximum possible overlap would be the smaller of the two, but wait, maybe even more? Let me see. \n\nThe maximum possible overlap between the two groups (prom and debate attendees) can't be more than the size of the smaller group. Since debate has at least 70, and prom has at least 90, the maximum overlap possible between them is 70 (since all debate attendees could also be prom attendees). \n\nSo if we take that maximum overlap, then the total number of students in either event would be 90 (prom) + 70 (debate) - 70 (overlap) = 90. \n\nWait, but that's assuming that all debate attendees were also at the prom. So in that case, the total would be just the prom's 90. But then the debate's minimum is 70, so maybe that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum possible total attendees is 90 (prom) +70 (debate) - x, where x is the overlap. To minimize the total, maximize x. The maximum possible x can't exceed the size of either group. Since debate has 70, the maximum overlap is 70. So then total is 90 +70 -70 =90. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of students who attended at least one is 90. Therefore, the maximum number who didn't attend either is 200 -90 =110. Wait, but that's one of the options, option E. But wait, hold on. Let me check again because maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% took part in debate\". So the actual numbers could be higher. To find the minimal number of students attending either, we need to take the minimal numbers for each (since higher numbers would only increase the total). So the minimal possible for prom is 90, debate is 70. \n\nTo minimize their union, maximize their intersection. The maximum possible intersection between the two is the smaller of the two groups, which is 70. So yes, 90+70-70 =90. So the minimal number attending either is 90, so the maximum not attending either is 200-90=110. But that's option E. However, the options include E as 110, but let me check the options again. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem says \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So the actual number could be higher. To minimize the number of students who attended at least one event, we need the minimal possible numbers for each (since if they are higher, that would mean more people attended). So the minimal numbers are 90 and 70. So the minimal total is indeed 90 +70 - overlap. The maximum possible overlap is 70, so 90+70-70=90. So 200-90=110. So E would be correct. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check with another approach. Let me denote:\n\nLet P be the number who went to prom, D the number who debated. We know P \u2265 90, D \u226570. We want to find the maximum possible number not in P or D, which is 200 - (P + D - P\u2229D). To maximize this, we need to minimize (P + D - P\u2229D). \n\nThe minimal value of (P + D - P\u2229D) is when P\u2229D is as large as possible. The maximum possible P\u2229D is the minimum of P and D. Since P can be as low as 90 and D as low as 70, the maximum possible overlap is 70 (since D is 70, so all D could be in P). \n\nThus, the minimal (P + D - P\u2229D) is 90 +70 -70 =90. Hence the maximum non-attendees are 200-90=110. So that would be E. \n\nBut wait, the options have E as 110, but maybe the question is worded as \"at least 45%\", so maybe they can't be less than those percentages. So the minimal possible attendees are indeed 90 and 70, so the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, but maybe there's a trick here. Let me check again. Suppose that the prom had exactly 90, debate exactly 70, and all debate attendees were also at the prom. Then total in either is 90, so 200-90=110. \n\nAlternatively, if the prom had 90 and debate 70, but with some overlap less than 70, then the total would be higher, so the non-attendees would be lower. So the maximum possible non-attendees is indeed 110. \n\nWait but looking at the options, E is 110, but the problem says \"at least 45%\", so perhaps the numbers can be higher. Wait, but to minimize the total attendees, we take the minimum possible for each, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where you can't have the overlap more than the other? Wait, no. For example, if all debate attendees went to the prom, then that's possible. So the maximum overlap is indeed 70. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is E)110. But wait, the options include E as 110. Wait, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. \n\nWait, another way: The question says \"at least 45% attended the prom\" so the number could be 45% or more. Similarly for debate. To get the maximum number not attending either, we need as few as possible in either. So we set the prom attendees to exactly 45%, debate to exactly 35%, and maximize their overlap. \n\nSo 45% of 200 is 90, 35% is 70. The overlap can be up to 70 (all debate attendees are in prom). Then total in either is 90. \n\nThus, 200-90=110. So the answer should be E. \n\nHmm, but why is the option C 90? Maybe someone might think that adding 45% and 35% gives 80% and subtract from 100% gives 20% which is 40, but that's wrong. Or perhaps another approach? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion. Wait, let me re-calculate. \n\nThe minimal number in either is P + D - (their intersection). To minimize this, you want to maximize the overlap. The maximum possible overlap between P and D is the smaller of P and D. Since P is 90 and D is 70, the maximum overlap is 70. \n\nSo P + D - overlap =90 +70 -70=90. So total in at least one is 90, so the remaining is 110. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer must be E. But wait the options given include E as 110, so that's correct. But let me check again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"at least 45%\", so the prom could have more than 90. But to find the maximum number who didn't attend either, we need the minimal possible in either. So the minimal possible is when the prom is exactly 90, debate exactly 70, and all debate attendees are in the prom. So that gives the minimal total in either, leading to maximum non-attendees. \n\nYes, so that's right. So the answer should be E)110. But wait, the options list E as 110. So I think that's the correct answer. \n\nWait but maybe there's a mistake here because sometimes in these problems, you have to consider that the percentages can't overlap beyond their own minimums. Wait no, the logic seems okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the percentages. Let me confirm: 45% of 200 is 90 (since 200*0.45=90). 35% of 200 is 70. So that's right. \n\nHmm, I think I'm confident that E is the correct answer here. So why are other options there? Let me see. For example, if someone thought that the minimal total attendees are 90+70 =160, then 200-160=40, but that's not an option. Or perhaps if someone thought that the maximum overlap can't exceed the other's minimum, but that's already considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that the minimum possible total is 45% +35% =80%, so 80% of 200 is 160, so 200-160=40, but that's not an option. So perhaps the options are designed to trick people into that. But the inclusion-exclusion shows that the minimal is lower. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E)110. Wait, but the options given in the problem include E as 110. So that must be correct. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me check again. Let me see the options again: \n\nOptions: \n\nA)27 \n\nB)81 \n\nC)90 \n\nD)99 \n\nE)110 \n\nYes, so E is 110. So that's the answer. \n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Suppose that the prom had 90 students and the debate had 70, and all 70 debate students were also at the prom. Then the total number of students who went to at least one event is 90. Therefore, the number who didn't go to either is 200 -90 =110. That seems correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a constraint. The problem says \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% took part in the debating session\". So the numbers could be higher. But when trying to maximize the number who didn't attend either, we need the minimal possible numbers for each (since higher numbers would mean more people attended). So using exactly the minimum percentages is the way to go. \n\nYes, so the answer is E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so the problem here is about finding the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom or the debating session. Let me try to think through this step by step. \n\nFirst, the school has 200 students total. The question says at least 45% attended the prom and at least 35% took part in the debating session. We need to find the maximum possible number who didn't go to either. Hmm, right, maximum number of non-attendees. \n\nWait, the key here is that \"at least\" percentages are given. So for the prom, the minimum number attending is 45%, which is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. Similarly, the debating session had at least 35%, so that's 0.35 * 200 = 70 students. But the question is asking for the maximum number who didn't attend either. To maximize the number of students who didn't attend either event, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of them. \n\nOh right, because the total students not in either is total minus those who attended at least one. So to maximize the non-attendees, the attendees (prom or debate) should be as small as possible. \n\nThe formula here would be: the number who attended prom OR debate is at least (45% + 35%) of 200, but since there could be overlap, the minimum possible total attendees would be when the overlap is as large as possible. Wait, let me think again. \n\nThe minimum possible number of students attending at least one event is equal to the sum of the minimums minus the maximum possible overlap. Wait, maybe I should recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. \n\nThe formula is: |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. To minimize the total number of students in A \u222a B, we need to maximize the overlap (the intersection). \n\nSo since the minimum number of prom attendees is 90 and debate is 70, the maximum possible overlap would be the smaller of the two, but wait, maybe even more? Let me see. \n\nThe maximum possible overlap between the two groups (prom and debate attendees) can't be more than the size of the smaller group. Since debate has at least 70, and prom has at least 90, the maximum overlap possible between them is 70 (since all debate attendees could also be prom attendees). \n\nSo if we take that maximum overlap, then the total number of students in either event would be 90 (prom) + 70 (debate) - 70 (overlap) = 90. \n\nWait, but that's assuming that all debate attendees were also at the prom. So in that case, the total would be just the prom's 90. But then the debate's minimum is 70, so maybe that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimum possible total attendees is 90 (prom) +70 (debate) - x, where x is the overlap. To minimize the total, maximize x. The maximum possible x can't exceed the size of either group. Since debate has 70, the maximum overlap is 70. So then total is 90 +70 -70 =90. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of students who attended at least one is 90. Therefore, the maximum number who didn't attend either is 200 -90 =110. Wait, but that's one of the options, option E. But wait, hold on. Let me check again because maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% took part in debate\". So the actual numbers could be higher. To find the minimal number of students attending either, we need to take the minimal numbers for each (since higher numbers would only increase the total). So the minimal possible for prom is 90, debate is 70. \n\nTo minimize their union, maximize their intersection. The maximum possible intersection between the two is the smaller of the two groups, which is 70. So yes, 90+70-70 =90. So the minimal number attending either is 90, so the maximum not attending either is 200-90=110. But that's option E. However, the options include E as 110, but let me check the options again. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem says \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So the actual number could be higher. To minimize the number of students who attended at least one event, we need the minimal possible numbers for each (since if they are higher, that would mean more people attended). So the minimal numbers are 90 and 70. So the minimal total is indeed 90 +70 - overlap. The maximum possible overlap is 70, so 90+70-70=90. So 200-90=110. So E would be correct. \n\nBut wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check with another approach. Let me denote:\n\nLet P be the number who went to prom, D the number who debated. We know P \u2265 90, D \u226570. We want to find the maximum possible number not in P or D, which is 200 - (P + D - P\u2229D). To maximize this, we need to minimize (P + D - P\u2229D). \n\nThe minimal value of (P + D - P\u2229D) is when P\u2229D is as large as possible. The maximum possible P\u2229D is the minimum of P and D. Since P can be as low as 90 and D as low as 70, the maximum possible overlap is 70 (since D is 70, so all D could be in P). \n\nThus, the minimal (P + D - P\u2229D) is 90 +70 -70 =90. Hence the maximum non-attendees are 200-90=110. So that would be E. \n\nBut wait, the options have E as 110, but maybe the question is worded as \"at least 45%\", so maybe they can't be less than those percentages. So the minimal possible attendees are indeed 90 and 70, so the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, but maybe there's a trick here. Let me check again. Suppose that the prom had exactly 90, debate exactly 70, and all debate attendees were also at the prom. Then total in either is 90, so 200-90=110. \n\nAlternatively, if the prom had 90 and debate 70, but with some overlap less than 70, then the total would be higher, so the non-attendees would be lower. So the maximum possible non-attendees is indeed 110. \n\nWait but looking at the options, E is 110, but the problem says \"at least 45%\", so perhaps the numbers can be higher. Wait, but to minimize the total attendees, we take the minimum possible for each, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where you can't have the overlap more than the other? Wait, no. For example, if all debate attendees went to the prom, then that's possible. So the maximum overlap is indeed 70. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is E)110. But wait, the options include E as 110. Wait, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. \n\nWait, another way: The question says \"at least 45% attended the prom\" so the number could be 45% or more. Similarly for debate. To get the maximum number not attending either, we need as few as possible in either. So we set the prom attendees to exactly 45%, debate to exactly 35%, and maximize their overlap. \n\nSo 45% of 200 is 90, 35% is 70. The overlap can be up to 70 (all debate attendees are in prom). Then total in either is 90. \n\nThus, 200-90=110. So the answer should be E. \n\nHmm, but why is the option C 90? Maybe someone might think that adding 45% and 35% gives 80% and subtract from 100% gives 20% which is 40, but that's wrong. Or perhaps another approach? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion. Wait, let me re-calculate. \n\nThe minimal number in either is P + D - (their intersection). To minimize this, you want to maximize the overlap. The maximum possible overlap between P and D is the smaller of P and D. Since P is 90 and D is 70, the maximum overlap is 70. \n\nSo P + D - overlap =90 +70 -70=90. So total in at least one is 90, so the remaining is 110. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer must be E. But wait the options given include E as 110, so that's correct. But let me check again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"at least 45%\", so the prom could have more than 90. But to find the maximum number who didn't attend either, we need the minimal possible in either. So the minimal possible is when the prom is exactly 90, debate exactly 70, and all debate attendees are in the prom. So that gives the minimal total in either, leading to maximum non-attendees. \n\nYes, so that's right. So the answer should be E)110. But wait, the options list E as 110. So I think that's the correct answer. \n\nWait but maybe there's a mistake here because sometimes in these problems, you have to consider that the percentages can't overlap beyond their own minimums. Wait no, the logic seems okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the percentages. Let me confirm: 45% of 200 is 90 (since 200*0.45=90). 35% of 200 is 70. So that's right. \n\nHmm, I think I'm confident that E is the correct answer here. So why are other options there? Let me see. For example, if someone thought that the minimal total attendees are 90+70 =160, then 200-160=40, but that's not an option. Or perhaps if someone thought that the maximum overlap can't exceed the other's minimum, but that's already considered. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that the minimum possible total is 45% +35% =80%, so 80% of 200 is 160, so 200-160=40, but that's not an option. So perhaps the options are designed to trick people into that. But the inclusion-exclusion shows that the minimal is lower. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E)110. Wait, but the options given in the problem include E as 110. So that must be correct. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me check again. Let me see the options again: \n\nOptions: \n\nA)27 \n\nB)81 \n\nC)90 \n\nD)99 \n\nE)110 \n\nYes, so E is 110. So that's the answer. \n\nWait a second, but let me think again. Suppose that the prom had 90 students and the debate had 70, and all 70 debate students were also at the prom. Then the total number of students who went to at least one event is 90. Therefore, the number who didn't go to either is 200 -90 =110. That seems correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing a constraint.
