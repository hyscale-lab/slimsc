      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Ram and Krishna are starting from points A and B at the same time and moving towards each other. Their speeds are 20 m/s and 40 m/s respectively. They meet at point C after 10 seconds. I need to find the total distance between A and B. Hmm, let's think.\n\nAlright, when two people are moving towards each other, their relative speed adds up, right? So the combined speed is 20 + 40 = 60 m/s. Since they meet after 10 seconds, the total distance they covered together in that time should be the distance between A and B. Because when they meet, they've covered the entire distance between the two points.\n\nSo, time is 10 seconds. Distance is speed multiplied by time. So total distance would be (20 +40) *10. Let me calculate that. 60 times 10 is 600. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 600 meters. But let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate each of their distances separately and add them. Let's see. Ram's distance is 20 m/s *10 s = 200 meters. Krishna's distance is 40*10=400. Adding those gives 200+400=600. Yeah that's the same. So the answer should be E)600 meters. Wait but option A is 700. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait the problem says they start at the same time towards each other. So yes, their combined speed leads to the total distance. So 60 m/s *10s is indeed 600. So the correct answer must be E. Let me check the options again. The options are A)700, B)1000, C)700 km (which is way too big, probably a trick), D)555, E)600. So E is correct.\n",
