      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about combinations, right? So we have a box with balls numbered from 1 to n, and we need to find n such that the number of ways to choose two balls without selecting the one numbered 3 is 45. \n\nWait, the key here is that the ball numbered 3 isn't selected. So the total number of ways to choose two balls without including ball 3 would be the same as choosing two balls from all the balls except ball 3. Since there are n balls total, removing ball 3 leaves us with (n-1) balls. The number of ways to choose two from those is combination (n-1 choose 2). \n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n!/(k!(n -k)!), so in this case it would be C(n-1, 2) = (n-1)(n-2)/2. According to the problem, this equals 45. \n\nSo I need to set up the equation: (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45. Let me solve for n here. Multiply both sides by 2: (n-1)(n-2) = 90. \n\nExpanding the left side gives n\u00b2 - 3n + 2 = 90. Subtract 90 to get the quadratic equation: n\u00b2 -3n -88 = 0. Wait, let me check that expansion again. (n-1)(n-2) is n^2 -2n -n +2 = n\u00b2-3n+2. Yeah, that's right. So moving 90 over gives n\u00b2 -3n +2 -90 = n\u00b2-3n -88 =0. \n\nHmm, solving this quadratic equation. Let's try factoring. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -88 and add up to -3. Let's see factors of 88: 8 and 11. Oh, if it's 8 and -11, then 8 * (-11) = -88 and 8 + (-11) = -3. So the factors would be (n -11)(n +8) =0. \n\nSo the solutions are n=11 or n=-8. Since n can't be negative, n must be 11. Wait, but let me check the options. The options given are A)11, B)10, etc. So 11 is an option. But wait, let me confirm my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait another thought: The problem states that the number of ways when ball 3 is not selected is 45. So the total number of ways without restriction would be C(n,2), and the number of ways where ball 3 is selected would be C(n-1,1), since you have to pick ball 3 and one other. Therefore, the total without ball 3 would be C(n,2) - (n-1) = 45. Wait, maybe that's another way to approach it. Let me see which approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, the first approach was considering that when excluding ball 3, you have n-1 balls left, so the number of 2-ball selections is C(n-1,2). So both approaches should agree, but let me check if I made a mistake in the first method. Let me test with n=11. \n\nFirst approach: C(10,2) is (10*9)/2 =45. Which matches the problem's 45. So that's correct. Therefore the answer is 11, which is option A. \n\nWait but let me check why I thought of the second approach. Maybe to cross-verify. Let's see: total ways C(n,2) minus the number of pairs that include 3. The number of pairs that include 3 is (n-1 choose 1) since you pick 3 and any other. So total without 3 is C(n,2) - (n-1) = 45. Let me plug in n=11 here. C(11,2)=55, 55 -10=45. Which also works. So both methods confirm that n=11 is correct. \n\nLooking at the options, A is 11. So the answer must be A. \n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)11, B)10, C)9, D)8, E)7. So yeah, A is the first option. \n\nHmm, so why would someone think of another answer? Maybe if they made an error in setting up the equation. For example, if they thought the number of ways not selecting 3 is C(n-1, 2) but messed up the algebra. Let me see, suppose someone thought (n-1)(n-2) = 45*2=90. Then solving n\u00b2-3n +2=90, leading to n\u00b2-3n-88=0. Which factors to (n-11)(n+8)=0. So yes, same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe if someone thought the equation was (n-1 choose 2) =45, so they set (n-1)(n-2)/2=45. Let me compute for n=10: (9)(8)/2=36, which is less than 45. n=11 gives 10*9/2=45, so that's exactly right. So the correct answer is 11, which is option A. \n\nTherefore the answer is A.\n",

The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n!/(k!(n - k)!), right? So the total number of ways to choose two balls from n would be C(n, 2). But wait, the problem specifies that the ball numbered 3 isn't selected. So actually, we need to calculate the number of ways where neither of the two selected balls is number 3.\n\nIf the ball 3 isn't selected, that means we have to choose both balls from the remaining (n - 1) balls. Because excluding the 3, there are n-1 balls left. So the number of ways should be C(n-1, 2). The problem states this equals 45. So the equation is C(n-1, 2) = 45.\n\nLet me write that out: (n-1)*(n-2)/2 = 45. Because the combination formula for 2 is (n-1 choose 2) which is (n-1)(n-2)/2. \n\nNow I can solve for n.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -88 and add up to -3. Let's see factors of 88: 8 and 11. 11 and -8 would multiply to -88 and 11 -8 = 3.

So the solutions are n=11 or n= -8. Since n can't be negative, n must be 11.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because if n is 11, then n-1 is 10. So C(10,2) is 45. Let me calculate that: 10*9/2 = 45.
