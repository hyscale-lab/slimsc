      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. Amy has 10 different types of books, and she wants to code each with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The order in the pair doesn't matter, so like AB is the same as BA. We need to find the smallest number of letters needed so that the total number of possible codes (single letters plus pairs) is at least 10. Hmm.\n\nSo, the problem is about combinations. Since the order doesn't matter for the pairs, the number of possible pairs is the combination of n letters taken 2 at a time. And the single letters are just n. So the total number of codes would be n + (n choose 2). We need that total to be at least 10. Let me write that down.\n\nThe formula for combinations is n choose 2 = n(n-1)/2. So total codes = n + n(n-1)/2. Let's set that equal to or greater than 10 and solve for n.\n\nLet me try plugging in the options. The options are 3,4,5,10,20. Let's start with the smallest first to find the minimum.\n\nOption A: 3 letters. Let's compute:\nSingle letters: 3.\nPairs: 3C2 = 3*2/2=3. Total codes: 3+3=6. That's only 6, which is less than 10. So 3 is too small.\n\nNext, option B: 4 letters.\nSingles:4.\nPairs: 4C2 = 4*3/2=6. Total is 4+6=10. Oh, exactly 10. Wait, so that would work. But wait the question says \"the smallest number of letters\". So 4 would be enough. But hold on, let me check again.\n\nWait, if n=4 gives exactly 10 codes, that's exactly what's needed. So then why is there an option C (5) here? Maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.\n\nWait the problem says \"each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters\". So as long as the total number of codes is at least 10, the minimal n would be 4. Because 4 gives exactly 10, so that's sufficient. Therefore the answer is B)4. But wait, let me check the other options to be sure.\n\nOption C is 5. Let's see, for 5 letters:\n\nSingles:5. Pairs:5C2=10. Total 15. That's more than enough, but since 4 works, 5 is not minimal. So the answer should be B. Hmm, but let me think again if I interpreted the pairs correctly. The problem says \"pair of two different letters\" and order doesn't matter, so combinations, not permutations. So yes, combinations. So the calculation is correct. So 4 letters gives exactly 10 codes. So the minimal is 4. So the answer is B.\n",

The question is asking for the smallest number of letters needed so that all 10 types can be uniquely represented. The order in the pair doesn't matter, so pairs like AB and BA are the same. \n\nHmm, right. Let me think. So this sounds like a combinations problem. Since the order doesn't matter for the pairs, the number of possible pairs is the combination of n letters taken 2 at a time. And then the total number of codes would be the number of single letters plus the number of pairs. \n\nSo, let's denote the number of letters as n. The total number of possible codes Amy can create is equal to the number of single-letter codes plus the number of two-letter combinations. The single-letter codes are just n, since each letter is a code by itself. The two-letter codes are combinations of 2 different letters, so that's C(n,2). \n\nSo the total codes are n + C(n,2). We need this total to be at least 10. \n\nThe formula for combinations is C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2. So adding that to n gives the total codes as n + [n(n-1)/2]. Let me write that as an equation: \n\nTotal codes = n + (n(n-1)/2) \n\nWe need this to be \u226510. Let me set up the inequality:\n\nn + [n(n-1)/2] \u2265 10 \n\nLet me simplify this equation. Let's combine the terms. \n\nFirst, multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n2n + n(n-1) \u2265 20 \n\nExpanding that: \n\n2n + n\u00b2 - n \u226520 \n\nCombine like terms: \n\nn\u00b2 + n \u226520 \n\nSo that simplifies to n\u00b2 +n -20 \u22650 \n\nHmm, solving the quadratic equation n\u00b2 +n -20 =0. Let's find the roots. \n\nUsing the quadratic formula, n = [-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 80)] / 2 \n\nBecause the discriminant is 1 + 80 = 81. So sqrt(81) is 9. \n\nThus, n = [ -1 +9 ] /2 = 8/2 =4, or the other root is negative, which we can ignore since n must be positive. \n\nSo the equation equals zero at n=4. Since the quadratic opens upwards (coefficient of n\u00b2 is positive), the inequality n\u00b2 +n -20 \u22650 holds when n \u22654 or n \u2264 -5. Since n can't be negative, we consider n\u22654. \n\nWait, but let's check this. Let me plug in n=4 into the original total codes equation. \n\nTotal codes for n=4: 4 + (4*3)/2 = 4 +6 =10. Exactly 10. So that's perfect. \n\nSo if Amy uses 4 letters, she can make exactly 10 codes (4 singles and 6 pairs). That would exactly cover the 10 types. \n\nWait, but the options include 4 as option B. So the answer should be 4, right? Let me check with n=3 just to be sure. \n\nFor n=3: 3 + (3*2)/2 =3+3=6. Which is only 6 codes, which is less than 10. So 3 letters aren't enough. \n\nSo 4 letters give exactly 10. So the minimal number is 4. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is B)4. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"pair of two different letters\", so the pairs can't have the same letters.
