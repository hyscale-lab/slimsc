      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen number from 1 to 1000 is relatively prime to 1000. Hmm, relatively prime means they share no common factors except 1, right? So first, I should probably factorize 1000 to see its prime components. Let me think, 1000 is 10 cubed, which is 2^3 * 5^3. So the prime factors are 2 and 5. \n\nThe problem is asking for numbers that don't share any of these factors. So basically, numbers not divisible by 2 or 5. Wait, right. So the probability would be the count of numbers from 1 to 1000 that are not divisible by 2 or 5, divided by 1000. \n\nHow do I calculate that? Oh, inclusion-exclusion principle maybe. Let me recall. The number of numbers not divisible by 2 or 5 is equal to total numbers minus those divisible by 2 or 5. \n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion for the count of numbers divisible by 2 or 5. Let's see:\n\nTotal numbers: 1000.\n\nNumbers divisible by 2: 1000/2 = 500.\n\nNumbers divisible by 5: 1000/5 = 200.\n\nBut then numbers divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 10) are counted twice, so subtract those. The count is 1000/(2*5) = 1000/10 = 100. \n\nSo total divisible by 2 or 5 is 500 + 200 - 100 = 600. \n\nTherefore, numbers not divisible by either would be 1000 - 600 = 400. \n\nSo the probability would be 400/1000 = 0.4. Which simplifies to 2/5. Wait, but hold on. Let me check again because I might have messed up the fractions. \n\nWait 400 divided by 1000 is 2/5. Hmm, so that would be option D? But wait, I remember that Euler's totient function \u03c6(n) gives the number of integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n. Maybe I should use that approach instead to cross-verify. \n\nEuler's totient function \u03c6(1000) would be 1000 multiplied by (1 - 1/2) for the prime 2, and (1 - 1/5) for the prime 5. Let's compute that. \n\n\u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 1000 * (1/2) * (4/5) = 1000 * (2/5) = 400. So that matches the previous count. \n\nTherefore, the probability is \u03c6(1000)/1000 = 400/1000 = 2/5. So the answer is D. \n\nWait but the options given are A)5/7, B)3/5, C)4/7, D)2/5, E)2/7. So D is an option. Hmm, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the inclusion-exclusion steps. Let me double-check. \n\nNumbers divisible by 2: 500. Numbers divisible by 5: 200. The overlap (divisible by 10) is 100. So total divisible by 2 or 5 is 500+200-100=600. So 1000-600=400. That's right. So 400/1000 reduces to 2/5. \n\nYes, so the answer should be D) 2/5.\n",

Hmm, relatively prime means they share no common factors except 1.
