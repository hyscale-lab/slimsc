      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to solve this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is [(272 - 32) multiplied by (124 + 176)] divided by (17 times 15 minus 15). I need to compute that and see which option it matches.\n\nFirst, I'll handle the parts inside the brackets. Starting with the numerator: (272 - 32) and (124 + 176). Let's calculate each part separately. \n\n272 minus 32... 272 minus 30 would be 242, then subtract 2 more gives 240. So that first part is 240. \n\nThen the second part in the numerator is 124 plus 176. Let me add those. 124 plus 176: 100 + 100 is 200, 24 +76 is 100, so total would be 300. Wait, 124+176: 124+176 = 300? Let me check again. 124 + 176: 100+100 is 200, 24+76 is 100, so yes, that's 300. So the numerator is 240 multiplied by 300. \n\nNow the denominator is (17\u00d715 -15). Let me compute that. 17 multiplied by 15. Hmm, 17 times 10 is 170, 17 times 5 is 85, so 170 +85 is 255. Then subtract 15. 255 minus 15 is 240. \n\nSo putting it all together: the numerator is 240 \u00d7 300, and the denominator is 240. Wait a second, so the 240 in the numerator and denominator might cancel out. Let me see: (240\u00d7300)/240. The 240 cancels, leaving 300. \n\nLooking at the options, C is 300. So the answer should be C. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nChecking numerator again: (272-32)=240, correct. (124+176)=300, yes. Multiply those: 240\u00d7300 is 72,000. Denominator: 17\u00d715=255, minus 15 gives 240. So 72,000 divided by 240. Let me compute that again. 240 \u00d7 300 is 72,000. So 72,000 divided by 240 is indeed 300. So the result is 300, which is option C. \n\nWait, but I should check if I interpreted the parentheses correctly. The original expression is [(272 - 32)(124 + 176)] divided by (17x15 -15). The brackets around the two terms in the numerator probably mean multiplication between (272-32) and (124+176), right? So yes, that part's correct. And the denominator calculation is also correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer must be C)300. Let me check the options again. The options are A)0, B)2.25, C)300, D)400, E)None. Since 300 is an option, the correct choice is C.\n",

Let me check again. 124 + 176. 124 plus 170 is 294, then plus 6 more is 300. Yeah, that's right. So the second part is 300. \n\nSo the numerator is 240 multiplied by 300. Let me compute that. 240*300. Well, 24*3 is 72, and then add four zeros (since 240 is 24*10 and 300 is 3*100, so 10*100 is 1000). So 24*3=72, so 72*1000 = 72,000. Wait, no. Wait, 240 times 300 is the same as (24*10)*(30*10) = 24*30 * 100. 24*30 is 720, so 720*100 is 72,000. Yeah, so numerator is 72,000.\n\nNow the denominator is (17 times 15 minus 15). Let me compute that. 17 multiplied by 15 first. 17*15... 10*15 is 150, 7*15 is 105, so 150+105 = 255. Then subtract 15. So 255 -15 is 240. So denominator is 240.\n\nSo now the entire expression is 72,000 divided by 240. Let me compute that. \n\nHmm, 72,000 \u00f7 240. Maybe simplify by dividing numerator and denominator by 10 first. That gives 7,200 / 24. \n\nNow, 24 times 300 is 7,200. Because 24*300 = 24*(3*100) = 72*100 = 7,200. So 7200 divided by 24 is exactly 300. \n\nWait, so the result is 300.

Yes, because order of operations: multiplication comes before subtraction. So 17\u00d715 is 255, minus 15 is 240. Correct.\n\nSo the calculation seems right. So the answer should be C.
