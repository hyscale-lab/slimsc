      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about two machines producing yo-yos at different intervals, and we need to find out after how many minutes they will have produced a total of 10 yo-yos together. Hmm. So Machine A makes a yo-yo every 6 minutes, and Machine B every 9 minutes. The question is asking when their combined total reaches 10.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many yo-yos each machine produces over time and then add them up. Maybe I should think in terms of time intervals. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me start by considering how many yo-yos each machine makes in a certain time. Let's denote the time as t minutes. Then, the number of yo-yos from Machine A would be t divided by 6, but since you can't have a fraction of a yo-yo, it's actually the floor division or just the integer part. Wait, but maybe it's better to model this by looking at each machine's rate and adding them up until the total reaches 10. Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals to find when they both produce a yo-yo at the same time, but the question is about total count, not when they coincide.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the number of yo-yos each produces over time and set their sum to 10. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me think of the time t in minutes. The number of yo-yos from Machine A is t divided by 6, rounded down. Similarly for B, it's t divided by 9, rounded down. The sum of these two needs to equal 10.\n\nWait, but maybe the question is asking for exactly when their combined total reaches 10. So I need to find the smallest t where (number from A) + (number from B) \u2265 10? Or exactly 10? The question says \"will they have produced 10 yo-yos\". Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me check the question again: \"After how many minutes will they have produced 10 yo-yos?\" So I think it's when their combined total reaches exactly 10. But maybe it's the first time their total is at least 10. Hmm, that's a crucial point.\n\nWait, if the total is exactly 10, then maybe we have to find t where A's count + B's count =10. But since they produce at different rates, maybe it's possible that at a certain time, the sum is exactly 10. Alternatively, maybe it's the first time the total reaches 10 or more. The question might be interpreted as when the total number of yo-yos produced by both machines combined is 10. So we have to find the earliest time when their combined count is at least 10. Because if it's exactly 10, maybe that's possible at some point. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to model it step by step. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me tabulate the number of yo-yos each machine produces over time, then sum them up until the total reaches 10.\n\nLet's start at t=0, both machines start. At time 0, they haven't produced any yet. \n\nAt t=6: Machine A produces 1 yo-yo. Total so far: 1 (from A) +0 (B) =1.\n\nt=9: Machine B produces its first. So B has 1. Total is 1+1=2.\n\nt=12: A produces another (since 12/6=2). So A has 2, B has 1 (since 12/9 is 1.333, so floor to 1). Total 3.\n\nt=18: A has 3 (18/6=3), B has 2 (18/9=2). Total 5.\n\nt=24: A has 4 (24/6=4), B has 2 (24/9\u22482.666, so floor to 2). Total 6.\n\nHmm, 6 so far. Need 10 more. Wait, no, total is 6 here. So not enough.\n\nt=27: A has 27/6=4.5 \u2192 4, B has 3 (27/9=3). So total 4+3=7.\n\nt=30: A has 5 (30/6=5), B has 3 (30/9\u22483.333 \u21923). Total 8.\n\nt=36: A has 6 (36/6=6), B has 4 (36/9=4). Total 10. Oh, so at 36 minutes, the total is exactly 10. So that would be answer C) 36 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me check between 30 and 36. Let's check at 33 minutes. \n\nAt 33 minutes:\n\nA: 33/6 =5.5 \u21925 (since it's every 6 minutes, so the 5th is at 30, next at 36). So A has 5.\n\nB: 33/9 = 3.666 \u21923. So B has 3. Total 8. Still 8.\n\nAt 36: A is 6, B 4 \u2192 total 10. So that's exactly 10. So that's the first time they reach 10. So the answer is C)36.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way than enumerating all times. Let me think algebraically. Let me denote the time t. The number of yo-yos from A is floor(t/6) and from B is floor(t/9). We need floor(t/6) + floor(t/9) =10. We have to find the smallest t where this holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps approximate without the floor function first. Let me model the number as (t/6) + (t/9) =10. But that's an approximation since each machine only produces a yo-yo at exact intervals. Let me see:\n\nt/6 + t/9 =10 \u2192 (3t + 2t)/18 =10 \u21925t/18 =10 \u2192 t= (10*18)/5=36. Oh! Interesting. So that gives exactly 36. That's the same answer as before. So that's a shortcut. But why does that work? Because the equation assumes that the yo-yos are produced continuously, which they aren't. But in this case, the exact time when the sum of their rates would reach 10 is exactly when the actual discrete counts reach 10. That's a coincidence here. Because when t=36, each machine has produced exactly an integer number of yo-yos (6 and 4) which sum to 10. So that's why the approximate method works here. \n\nAlternatively, if the answer had been different, like if the actual counts were 5 and 4 at 36, that would sum to 9, but in this case, it's exactly 10. So the answer is 36. So option C.\n\nWait, just to confirm, let me check if maybe a smaller time could reach 10. For example, 30 minutes: 5+3=8, 36 is next. 36 is the first time they hit exactly 10. So that's correct. The options include 36, so the answer must be C.\n",

So the correct answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine when Machines A and B will have produced a combined total of 10 yo-yos, we analyze their production rates. Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, and Machine B every 9 minutes. We need the smallest time \\( t \\) where the sum of their outputs equals or exceeds 10. \n\nThe number of yo-yos produced by Machine A in \\( t \\) minutes is \\( \\frac{t}{6} \\), and by Machine B is \\( \\frac{t}{9} \\). Since partial yo-yos aren't counted, we use integer division (floor function). \n\nTesting the options:\n- **Option C (36 minutes)**:  \n  Machine A: \\( \\frac{36}{6} = 6 \\) yo-yos.  \n  Machine B: \\( \\frac{36}{9} = 4 \\) yo-yos.  \n  Total: \\( 6 + 4 = 10 \\).  \n\nChecking earlier times (e.g., 30, 33, 35 minutes) yields totals less than 10. Later options (e.g., 72, 64 minutes) exceed 10 but are not the earliest. Thus, **36 minutes** is the first time they produce exactly 10 yo-yos.  \n\nAnswer: C",
