      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. The problem is about an organization trying to raise money from employees. Hmm. So the total amount they wanted was 6 lakh rupees, right? And each employee was supposed to contribute equally. But then, if each gave 60 more, the total became 6.24 lakh. I need to find how many employees there are.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of employees as N. And let the original contribution per person be x rupees. So the first equation would be N * x = 600,000 (since 6 lakh is 600,000). \n\nThen, when each contributes 60 more, the new contribution per person is x + 60. The total then becomes N*(x +60) = 624,000 (since 6.24 lakh is 624,000). \n\nSo I have two equations:\n1. Nx = 600,000\n2. N(x +60) = 624,000\n\nI can substitute x from the first equation into the second. From the first equation, x = 600,000 / N. Plugging that into the second equation gives:\n\nN*( (600,000/N) + 60 ) = 624,000.\n\nLet me simplify that. The N in the first term cancels out, so:\n\n600,000 + 60N = 624,000.\n\nSubtract 600,000 from both sides: 60N = 24,000. \n\nDivide both sides by 60: N = 24,000 / 60 = 400. Wait, so that would be 400 employees? Let me check the options. Option C is 400. Hmm, but let me verify again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me redo the steps.\n\nOriginal total is 6,00,000. Let the number of employees be N. So each gives 6,00,000/N.\n\nIf each gives 60 more, the total becomes 6,24,000. So the equation is:\n\n(N employees) * (original contribution +60) = 6,24,000\n\nSo substituting original contribution as 6,00,000/N:\n\nN*(6,00,000/N + 60) = 6,24,000\n\nThe first term is 6,00,000, so adding 60*N gives total 6,24,000. \n\nSo 6,00,000 + 60N = 6,24,000 \u2192 60N = 24,000 \u2192 N=400. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer should be C)400. Wait but let me check the options again. The options are A)300, B)200, C)400, D)100, E)500. So C is there. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try plugging in the options to see. Let's try option C (400 employees). \n\nOriginal contribution per person would be 6,00,000 /400 = 1500. If they add 60, that becomes 1560. 400 *1560 = 400*1500=6,00,000 plus 400*60=24,000 \u2192 total 6,24,000. Exactly matches. So that works. \n\nAnother check: if I pick another option, like B)200. Then original per person is 3000. Adding 60 would be 3060. 200 *3060 = 612,000, which is less than 624k. Not right. Option A)300: 6,00,000/300 =2000. Add 60 \u21922060. 300*2060=618,000, still not 624k. So yeah, 400 is correct. So the answer should be C.\n",

Let the original contribution per employee be x rupees. Then, according to the first part, the total is N times x equals 6 lakh. So equation one would be N * x = 600,000 (since 1 lakh is 100,000). \n\nNow, the second scenario says if each contributed 60 more, so (x + 60) per person, then the total becomes 6.24 lakh. So the second equation is N*(x +60) = 624,000. \n\nNow I have two equations:\n1. Nx = 600,000\n2. N(x+60) = 624,000\n\nI can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate x. Let's see:\n\nN(x +60) - Nx = 624000 - 600000\nThat simplifies to 60N = 24,000. \n\nWait, because 624,000 minus 600,000 is 24,000. So 60N =24,000. \n\nThen solving for N, divide both sides by 60. N=24000/60. Let me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 60 is the same as 2400/6, which is 400. Wait, 60 times 400 is 24,000. So that would mean N is 400? Let me check.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the original equations. If N is 400, then original contribution x would be 600,000 /400. Let's compute that: 600,000 divided by 400. 600,000 divided by 400: 600,000 \u00f7 400 = 1500. So each was supposed to contribute 1500. \n\nThen, adding 60 would make it 1560. 400 employees times 1560 would be 400*1560. Let's calculate that. 400 *1500 is 600,000, plus 400*60 =24,000. So total is 624,000. Which matches the second condition. \n\nSo that seems correct. So the answer should be C)400. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)300, B)200, C)400, D)100, E)500. So option C is the right one. \n\nWait, but just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recheck the steps again. The difference between the two totals is 24,000, which comes from each of the N employees contributing 60 more. So the extra per person times N equals the total extra. So 60*N = 24,000 \u2192 N=400.
