      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Mark and John are talking about their money. The question is asking how much money John had originally. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the statements. Mark tells John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So that's one condition. Then John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So each of their statements is a conditional scenario. I need to set up equations based on these statements.\n\nLet me denote the variables. Let me call the amount of money John has as J, and Mark's money as M. Then I can translate their statements into equations.\n\nStarting with Mark's statement: If John gives him half his money, then Mark will have 75. So, if John gives half of J to Mark, then Mark's new amount is M + (J/2), and that equals 75. So equation one is M + (J/2) = 75.\n\nThen John's statement is: If Mark gives him one third of his (Mark's) money, then John will have 75. So, Mark gives (M/3) to John. Then John's new amount is J + (M/3) = 75. So equation two is J + (M/3) = 75.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) = 75\n2. J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations for J and M. Let's see how to do that. Maybe substitution or elimination. Let me try substitution.\n\nFrom equation 1: Let's solve for M in terms of J. \n\nM = 75 - (J/2)\n\nThen plug that into equation 2. So equation 2 becomes:\n\nJ + ( (75 - (J/2) ) / 3 ) = 75\n\nHmm, let me work that out. Let's compute the term (M/3) which is (75 - J/2)/3. \n\nSo the equation is:\n\nJ + [ (75 - (J/2)) / 3 ] = 75\n\nLet me multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate the denominator. \n\n3*J + (75 - (J/2)) = 3*75\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3J + 75 - (J/2) = 225\n\nNow, combine like terms. Let's first combine the terms with J. \n\n3J - (J/2) = (6J/2 - J/2) = (5J/2)\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n5J/2 + 75 = 225\n\nSubtract 75 from both sides:\n\n5J/2 = 225 - 75 = 150\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n5J = 300\n\nDivide by 5:\n\nJ = 60\n\nWait, so John has 60? But let me check this because I might have made a mistake in the algebra. Let me go through again.\n\nWait, let me check the equations again. Let me plug back into the original equations to verify.\n\nSuppose J = 60. Then from equation 1:\n\nM + (60/2) = M +30 =75 \u2192 M =45.\n\nNow check equation 2: J + (M/3) \u2192 60 + (45/3)=60 +15=75. That works. \n\nHmm, so John has 60? But looking at the options, B is 60. But wait, the options given are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, the question says \"How much money did John have?\" So according to my calculation, the answer would be B)60, which is an option. But let me check again because sometimes these problems can be tricky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I mixed up the equations. Let me re-express the problem again.\n\nMark's statement: If John gives him half his money, Mark will have 75. So Mark's original money plus half of John's equals 75. That's correct.\n\nJohn's statement: If Mark gives him a third of his money, then John will have 75. So John's original money plus a third of Mark's equals 75. That also seems correct.\n\nSo solving gives J=60, M=45. Plugging back in:\n\nFirst scenario: John gives half his 60, which is 30. So Mark would have 45+30=75. Correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives a third of his 45, which is 15. John has 60+15=75. Correct. So that works. So the answer should be B)60. But wait, the options include 60 as B, so that must be correct. \n\nHmm, but the options given here include B as 60. So the answer is B?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see again.\n\nWait another thought: Let me try another approach. Let me suppose the answer is 60. But let me see the options again. The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18. So B is there. So according to this, the answer is B. But maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me try with another option to check.\n\nSuppose the answer was E)18. Let's see. If John had 18, then from equation 1:\n\nM + 9 =75 \u2192 M=66. Then equation 2: 18 + (66/3)=18+22=40, which is not 75. So that's wrong.\n\nAnother option, say A)22. Then J=22. So M would be 75 -11=64. Then equation 2:22 + 64/3. 64/3 is about 21.33, so total 43.33, not 75. Nope.\n\nOption C)28. J=28. Then equation1: M +14 =75 \u2192 M=61. Then equation2: 28 + (61/3) \u224828+20.33=48.33, not 75.\n\nOption D)26. J=26. Then M =75 -13=62. Then equation2:26 + 62/3\u224826+20.666=46.666. No.\n\nSo only B gives the correct result. Therefore, the correct answer must be B)60. So the answer is B.\n",

Mark tells John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Then John responds, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So I need to find the initial amounts each has. Let me denote variables for that.\n\nLet me call the amount of money Mark has as M, and John's as J. Then, according to Mark's statement: if John gives him half his money, Mark's total becomes 75. So, after the transaction, Mark would have his original money plus half of John's. So the equation would be:\n\nM + (J/2) = 75.\n\nJohn's statement is a bit different. He says, if Mark gives him one third of Mark's money, then John will have 75. So in that case, John would receive (1/3) of Mark's money. So John's new amount is his original J plus (M/3), and that equals 75. So the equation is:\n\nJ + (M/3) = 75.\n\nWait, so now I have two equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) = 75\n2. J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations for M and J. Let me write them down again.\n\nFirst equation: M + 0.5J =75\n\nSecond equation: J + (M/3) =75.\n\nHmm, so I can use substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution. Let me solve one equation for one variable and plug into the other.\n\nMaybe solve the first equation for M. From equation 1:\n\nM = 75 - 0.5J\n\nThen plug this into equation 2's M term. Let's substitute M in equation 2:\n\nJ + [(75 - 0.5J)/3] =75.\n\nHmm, let's compute that step by step. Let me rewrite equation 2 with substitution:\n\nJ + ( (75 - 0.5J ) /3 ) =75.\n\nLet me multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate the denominator. Multiply each term by 3:\n\n3J + (75 - 0.5J) = 225 (since 75*3=225)\n\nNow combine like terms:\n\n3J - 0.5J +75 =225\n\nThat's 2.5J +75 =225\n\nSubtract 75 from both sides:\n\n2.5J = 150\n\nSo J = 150 / 2.5. Let's calculate that. 150 divided by 2.5. Well, 2.5 * 60 = 150, right? Because 2.5 times 60 is 150. So J=60?\n\nWait, but if John had 60, let's check if that makes sense. Let me plug back into the equations.\n\nFirst equation: M + (60/2) =75 \u2192 M +30=75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45. Now check John's statement. If Mark gives John a third of his money. A third of 45 is 15. So John would get 15, so John would have 60+15=75. That works. But wait, the question is asking how much John had. The answer would be 60, which is option B. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18. So B is an option, so that would be the answer?\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check because sometimes these problems can have a trick. Let me see. Let's check both scenarios again.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives Mark half his money. John has J=60, so half is 30. So John gives 30 to Mark. Mark had 45, so now he has 45+30=75. That's correct. \n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives John a third of his money. Mark has 45, so a third is 15. John had 60, so he now has 60+15=75. Correct again. So the calculations check out. So John had 60, which is option B. \n\nHmm, but wait, I thought sometimes these problems might be tricky in the wording. Let me read the problem again to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything.\n\nMark told John \"If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75.\" So yes, that's John giving half to Mark. John's statement is \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. So Mark gives one third of his own money to John. That's how I set up the equations. \n\nSo the answer should be B)60. But let me check the options again. The options include B as 60. So that's correct. \n\nWait, but I remember sometimes when there are two equations, maybe I made an error in algebra. Let me recheck the equations.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) =75\n\n2. J + (M/3) =75\n\nSolution steps:\n\nFrom equation 1: M =75 - (J/2)\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\nJ + [ (75 - J/2)/3 ] =75\n\nMultiply through by 3:\n\n3J +75 - (J/2) = 225\n\nWait, wait, maybe I made an error here. Let me recalculate this step again. Let me go back.\n\nWait, when I substituted into equation 2, the equation was:\n\nJ + ( (75 -0.5J)/3 ) =75\n\nMultiply all terms by 3:\n\n3*J + (75 -0.5J) = 225\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3J +75 -0.5J = 225.\n\nCombine 3J -0.5J is 2.5J. So 2.5J +75 =225. Then 2.5J=150, so J=60. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the answer must be B. But why is the option B 60, which is the same as John's initial amount. The problem says \"how much money did John have?\" So yes, that's correct. \n\nWait, but I thought maybe the answer is different because sometimes the question might be about Mark's money. Let me see the options again. The options include 60 as B, so that's correct. So I think the correct answer is B)60.\n",

Multiply each term by 3:\n\n3J + (75 - 0.5J) = 225 (since 75*3=225)\n\nNow combine like terms:\n\n3J - 0.5J +75 =225\n\nThat's 2.5J +75 =225\n\nSubtract 75 from both sides:\n\n2.5J = 150\n\nSo J = 150 / 2.5. Let's calculate that. 150 divided by 2.5. Well, 2.5 * 60 = 150, right? Because 2.5 times 60 is 150. So J=60?\n\nWait, but if John had 60, let's check if that makes sense. Let me plug back into the equations.\n\nFirst equation: M + (60/2) =75 \u2192 M +30=75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45. Now check John's statement. If Mark gives John a third of his money. A third of 45 is 15. So John would get 15, so John would have 60+15=75. That works. But wait, the question is asking how much John had. The answer would be 60, which is option B. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18. So B is an option, so that would be the answer?\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check because sometimes these problems can have a trick. Let me see. Let's check both scenarios again.\n\nFirst scenario: John gives Mark half his money. John has J=60, so half is 30. So John gives 30 to Mark. Mark had 45, so now he has 45+30=75. That's correct. \n\nSecond scenario: Mark gives John a third of his money. Mark has 45, so a third is 15. John had 60, so he now has 60+15=75. Correct again. So the calculations check out. So John had 60, which is option B. \n\nHmm, but wait, I thought sometimes these problems might be tricky in the wording. Let me read the problem again to ensure I didn't misinterpret anything.\n\nMark told John \"If you give me half your money I will have Rs.75.\" So yes, that's John giving half to Mark. John's statement is \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-. So Mark gives one third of his own money to John. That's how I set up the equations. \n\nSo the answer should be B)60. But let me check the options again. The options include B as 60. So that's correct. \n\nWait, but I remember sometimes when there are two equations, maybe I made an error in algebra. Let me recheck the equations.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) =75\n\n2. J + (M/3) =75\n\nSolution steps:\n\nFrom equation 1: M =75 - (J/2)\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\nJ + [ (75 - J/2)/3 ] =75\n\nMultiply through by 3:\n\n3J +75 - (J/2) = 225\n\nWait, wait, maybe I made an error here. Let me recalculate this step again. Let me go back.\n\nWait, when I substituted into equation 2, the equation was:\n\nJ + ( (75 -0.5J)/3 ) =75\n\nMultiply all terms by 3:\n\n3*J + (75 -0.5J) = 225\n\nYes, that's correct. So 3J +75 -0.5J = 225.\n\nCombine 3J -0.5J is 2.5J. So 2.5J +75 =225. Then 2.5J=150, so J=60. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the answer must be B. But why is the option B 60, which is the same as John's initial amount. The problem says \"how much money did John have?\" So yes, that's correct. \n\nWait, but I thought maybe the answer is different because sometimes the question might be about Mark's money. Let me see the options again. The options include 60 as B, so that's correct. So I think the correct answer is B)60.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote Mark's money as \\( M \\) and John's money as \\( J \\).\n\nFrom Mark's statement: If John gives him half his money, Mark will have Rs.75. This gives the equation:\n\\[\nM + \\frac{J}{2} = 75 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\nFrom John's statement: If Mark gives him one-third of his money, John will have Rs.75. This gives the equation:\n\\[\nJ + \\frac{M}{3} = 75 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\nFirst, solve equation (1) for \\( M \\):\n\\[\nM = 75 - \\frac{J}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute this expression for \\( M \\) into equation (2):\n\\[\nJ + \\frac{75 - \\frac{J}{2}}{3} = 75\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 3 to eliminate the denominator:\n\\[\n3J + 75 - \\frac{J}{2} = 225\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n\\left(3J - \\frac{J}{2}\\right) + 75 = 225 \\implies \\frac{5J}{2} + 75 = 225\n\\]\n\nSubtract 75 from both sides:\n\\[\n\\frac{5J}{2} = 150 \\implies J = \\frac{150 \\times 2}{5} = 60\n\\]\n\nVerify the solution:\n- If John has \\( J = 60 \\), then from equation (1): \\( M = 75 - 30 = 45 \\).\n- Check John's statement: Mark gives \\( \\frac{45}{3} = 15 \\) to John, so John has \\( 60 + 15 = 75 \\), which is correct.\n\nBoth conditions are satisfied, so John initially had Rs.60.\n\nAnswer: B)60.\n\nAnswer: B",
