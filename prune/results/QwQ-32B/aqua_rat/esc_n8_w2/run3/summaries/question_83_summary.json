      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the other integer when given the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. One of the numbers is 350. Hmm, right. I remember there's a relationship between GCF, LCM, and the two numbers. Oh right, the formula: GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. So if I can use that here, maybe I can find the missing number.\n\nThe GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. One number is 350. Let me denote the other number as x. According to the formula, 11 * 7700 should equal 350 * x. Wait, let me write that down properly. So GCF * LCM = product of the numbers. So 11 * 7700 = 350 * x. Then solving for x would be (11*7700)/350. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let me compute 11 multiplied by 7700. 11*7700. Well, 7700 times 10 is 77,000, plus another 7,700 gives 84,700. So 11*7700 = 84,700. Then divide that by 350. Hmm, 84,700 divided by 350. Let me simplify this. Maybe I can divide numerator and denominator by 10 first to make it 8,470 / 35. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, 350 times 200 is 70,000. 350*242? Wait, maybe breaking it down. Let me see, 350 times 200 is 70,000. 350 times 24 is 8,400. 70,000 + 8,400 = 78,400. Wait, that's over. Hmm, maybe I need to do division step by step.\n\nWait, 84,700 divided by 350. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10: 8470 / 35. Let's compute 35 times 242. Let's see, 35*200 is 7000, 35*40 is 1400, so 35*240 = 8400. Then 35*2 is 70. So 240+2 is 242, so 35*242 = 8470. Oh! So 8470 divided by 35 is exactly 242. So x is 242? That's option A. Wait but let me check again. Because the GCF is 11, so the numbers must be multiples of 11. Let me see. 350 and 242. Let's check their GCF.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11? Hmm, 11*31 is 341, so 350-341 is 9, so 350 isn't a multiple of 11. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the GCF of the two numbers is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is one of the numbers. Is 350 divisible by 11? Let me check again. 11*31 is 341, 341 +11=352. So 350 divided by 11 gives 31.81... So it's not a multiple of 11. That can't be right. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake here. Because if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must have 11 as a common factor. But if one of them is 350, which isn't divisible by 11, that would contradict the GCF being 11. Hmm, so I must have messed up.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the question? Let me read again. The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The LCM is 7700. One of the integers is 350. Find the other. Wait, so maybe 350's GCF with the other number is 11. So 350 and the other number must have GCF 11. But if 350 is not divisible by 11, how can their GCF be 11? Because GCF has to divide both numbers. Therefore, this suggests that either the problem is wrong, or I made a mistake in my calculation. Or perhaps I need to check the steps again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula? Let me confirm the formula. The product of the LCM and GCF of two numbers equals the product of the numbers themselves. Yes, that's correct. So LCM(a,b) * GCF(a,b) = a*b. So that part is right. So according to that, if the GCF is 11 and LCM is 7700, then the product of the two numbers is 11 * 7700 = 84700. Then one number is 350, so the other is 84700 / 350 = 242, which is what I got before. But then 242 and 350's GCF must be 11. Let me check that.\n\nLet me compute GCF(350,242). Let's do prime factors. 350 is 2 * 5^2 * 7. 242 is 2 * 121, which is 2 * 11^2. So the common factors are just 2. So the GCF would be 2, not 11. Oh no! That's a problem. That means my answer can't be right because the GCF would be 2, but the problem states it's 11. So where did I go wrong?\n\nHmm, so this suggests that 242 is not the correct answer, even though the formula gives that. Therefore, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the formula applies here, but maybe there are some constraints. Wait, the formula should hold regardless. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the GCF of 242 and 350?\n\nWait let me recalculate GCF(350,242). The factors of 350 are 2 \u00d75\u00d75\u00d77. The factors of 242 are 2 \u00d711\u00d711. So the only common factor is 2. So their GCF is 2, but the problem says it's 11. Therefore, that can't be. So that means my initial approach must have an error. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, so that's impossible. Wait, so that would mean that either the question is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's numbers. Wait, but the problem says that the GCF is 11. So maybe there's a mistake in my calculation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check the steps again. Let me try again. Let me denote the two numbers as a and b. Given that GCF(a,b)=11, LCM(a,b)=7700, and one of them is 350. Let's suppose a =350, then find b.\n\nWe know that GCF(a,b)=11, so 11 divides both a and b. But 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. 350 /11 is approximately 31.8, so that can't be. Therefore, that suggests that 350 cannot be one of the numbers if their GCF is 11. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-express the numbers in terms of their GCF. Let me think. Let me recall that if the GCF of a and b is 11, then we can write a = 11*m and b=11*n where m and n are integers that are coprime (their GCF is 1). Then the LCM of a and b would be 11*m*n. Because LCM of 11m and 11n is 11*m*n when m and n are coprime.\n\nSo, according to this, LCM(a,b) = 11*m*n = 7700. So m*n = 7700 /11 = 700. And the product a*b is (11m)*(11n)= 121*m*n. But according to the formula, LCM(a,b)*GCF(a,b) = 7700*11 = 84700, which should equal a*b = 121*m*n. Since m*n is 700, 121*700 is 84,700, so that matches. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. Let's see. Since a is either 11m or 11n. Let's suppose that a = 350 = 11m. Then m would be 350/11, which is not an integer, so that can't be. Alternatively, if a is 350, then it must be that 350 =11*m. Since 350 isn't divisible by 11, that can't be. Therefore, the other number must be 350. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the other way around. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps 350 is not a multiple of 11, so the problem must be that either the question is wrong, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are allowed to have GCF 11 even if one isn't a multiple? No, that's impossible. The GCF must divide both numbers, so both must be multiples of 11. Therefore, 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. Wait, so that's a problem. Therefore, is there a mistake in the problem?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating 350 divided by 11. Let me check again. 11 times 31 is 341, 11\u00d732 is 352. So 350 is between those, so indeed, 350 is not divisible by 11. Therefore, the problem as stated can't have 350 as one of the numbers if their GCF is 11. Unless there's a typo in the problem. But since this is a multiple choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see if one of the options when paired with 350 gives a GCF of 11 and LCM of 7700. Let me try that approach. Let's check each option.\n\nThe options are A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nLet me check each one:\n\nOption A: 242 and 350.\n\nGCF(242, 350). As before, factors of 242 are 2\u00d711\u00b2, 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factors are 2, so GCF is 2. Not 11. So no.\n\nOption B:308. Let's compute GCF(308, 350).\n\nFactorize 308: 4 \u00d777 = 4\u00d77\u00d711. So 2\u00b2\u00d77\u00d711.\n\n350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. So common factors are 2 and 7. So GCF is 14. Not 11.\n\nOption C: 352. Let's see.\n\n352 divided by 11? 11\u00d732=352. So 352 is 11\u00d732. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Let's find GCF(352, 350).\n\nPrime factors of 352: 11\u00d732=11\u00d72^5. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factors are 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nHmm, that's not right.\n\nOption D:412. Let's see.\n\n412 divided by 11? 11\u00d737 is 407, 412-407=5. So not divisible by 11. So GCF would be GCD(412, 350). Let's factorize 412. 4\u00d7103? 4\u00d7103 is 412. 103 is a prime? 103 divided by 2,3,5,7,11? 11\u00d79=99, 103-99=4, so no. So 412 is 2\u00b2\u00d7103. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factor is 2. GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption E:456. Let's check.\n\n456 divided by 11? 11\u00d741 is 451. 456-451=5, so not divisible by 11. GCF(456,350). 456 factors: 8\u00d757 = 8\u00d73\u00d719. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factor is 2. GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nHmm, so none of the options when paired with 350 have a GCF of 11. That's a problem. But the question says the GCF is 11. So either all options are wrong, which is unlikely, or I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula approach. Let me think again. The formula says LCM * GCF = product of numbers. So if the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700, then product is 11 *7700 =84700. So one number is 350, so the other is 84700 /350 =242. But then the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that contradicts the given GCF. So this suggests that the problem has conflicting numbers. But the options don't have a number that when paired with 350 gives GCF 11 and LCM 7700. So perhaps there's an error in the problem's numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating LCM. Let me check LCM(350,242). LCM is (350*242)/GCF(350,242). GCF is 2. So LCM is (350\u00d7242)/2 = (350\u00d7121). 350\u00d7121. Let's see, 350\u00d7100=35000, 350\u00d720=7000, 350\u00d71=350. So total is 35000+7000=42000 +350=42350. But the problem states LCM is 7700, which is way smaller. So that's not matching. Therefore, the answer must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula? Let me double-check. The formula is correct. LCM(a,b) * GCF(a,b) = a*b. So if the given numbers are correct, then there must be an error here. Alternatively, maybe the question is correct and I'm missing something?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the numbers are 11 times something. Let me try the approach where a =11m and b=11n, with m and n coprime. Then LCM(a,b)=11*m*n =7700. So m*n =7700/11=700. And since a is 350, which is 11m, so 11m =350 \u2192 m=350/11. But that's not an integer, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the other number is 11m, so if a is 350, then 350 =11*m, which again gives m non-integer. So that's impossible. Therefore, the problem is impossible as given?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. Wait, but the options are given. Let me see if any of the options when paired with 350 gives GCF 11 and LCM 7700. Let me try option B:308.\n\nCompute GCF(308,350). As before, factors of 308 are 2\u00d72\u00d77\u00d711. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00d75\u00d77. So GCF is 2\u00d77=14. LCM would be (308\u00d7350)/14 = (308/14)*350 =22*350= 7700. Wait a second! Oh! Wait, the LCM here is exactly 7700. So even though the GCF is 14, which is not 11, but the LCM is 7700. But the problem states GCF is 11, so that's conflicting. So this option gives LCM correct but GCF wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check option C:352. GCF(352,350). 352 is 2^5\u00d711. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. So GCF is 2. LCM would be (352\u00d7350)/2 = (352\u00d7175) = let's see, 350\u00d7352= 350*(350+2) = 350\u00b2 + 700 = 122500 +700= 123200. Divide by 2 gives 61600. Which is way bigger than 7700. Not correct.\n\nWait, what about option B's LCM? Let me recalculate that. 308 and 350. LCM is (308 \u00d7350)/14 = (308/14)*350 =22 \u00d7350 = 7700. So yes, LCM is correct. But GCF is 14, not 11. So that's not matching the problem's GCF of 11. So that's not the answer.\n\nHmm. Option D:412 and 350. GCF is 2. LCM is (412\u00d7350)/2 =412\u00d7175. Let's see, 400\u00d7175=70,000, 12\u00d7175=2,100 \u2192 total 72,100. Not 7700.\n\nOption E:456 and 350. GCF is 2. LCM is (456\u00d7350)/2 =456\u00d7175. 400\u00d7175=70,000, 56\u00d7175=9,800 \u2192 total 79,800. Not 7700.\n\nHmm, so option B gives LCM correct but GCF wrong, others are worse. So what's going on here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, but I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again the first approach. The formula says LCM * GCF = product. So if the GCF is 11 and LCM is 7700, then the product is 84700. 350 times the other number must be 84700. So other number is 84700 /350 = 242. But that gives GCF 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the question has a typo and the GCF is 14, then option B would be correct. Or maybe the LCM is different. Alternatively, maybe the other number is 242, but the GCF is 2, so the question is wrong. But since this is a problem given to me, I need to pick from the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the GCF calculation between 242 and 350?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate GCF(242,350):\n\n242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11\u00b2. 350 divided by 2 is 175. So the GCF is 2. So that's correct. So the problem is conflicting. Unless there's an alternative way.\n\nWait, maybe the question meant that the GCF is 11, but one of the numbers is 350, which is not divisible by 11, so that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not listed. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's parameters?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct and I'm missing a step. Let me think differently. Let me try to represent the numbers as multiples of the GCF. Let me denote the two numbers as 11a and 11b, where a and b are coprime (since we factored out the GCF). Then LCM of 11a and 11b is 11ab (since a and b are coprime). According to the problem, LCM is 7700. So 11ab =7700 \u2192 ab= 700. Also, the two numbers are 11a and 11b. One of them is 350. So either 11a =350 or 11b=350. Let's see:\n\nCase 1: 11a =350 \u2192 a=350/11 \u224831.818... Not integer. Impossible.\n\nCase 2: 11b=350 \u2192 same problem. So neither case is possible. Thus, there is no solution under the given conditions. But the options are given. Hmm.\n\nThis suggests that the problem has conflicting parameters. However, the options include 242 which would be the other number via the formula, but that gives GCF 2. Alternatively, maybe the question intended the GCF to be 14, then the correct answer would be B (308). Or maybe I made a mistake in the problem's numbers. Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the problem's LCM?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the formula. Wait, the formula is definitely correct. Let me think of another approach. Let me list the factors.\n\nSuppose the two numbers are x and 350, GCF(x,350)=11, LCM(x,350)=7700. Since GCF is 11, then both x and 350 must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so that's impossible. Therefore the problem is invalid. But since the options are given, maybe I need to pick the closest one which gives LCM correct even if GCF is different? Like option B gives LCM correct but GCF 14. But the question specifies GCF is 11. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the GCF for option B. Let me recheck:\n\n308 and 350. Let's compute GCF step by step. \n\n308 divided by 14 is 22, 350 divided by 14 is 25. So 14 is a common factor. Let me see if there's a higher common factor. 308 \u00f7 2 = 154, 350 \u00f72=175. GCF of 154 and 175. 154 factors: 2\u00d77\u00d711. 175:5\u00b2\u00d77. Common factor is 7. So GCF is 2\u00d77=14. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so I'm stuck. The formula gives 242 but that has GCF 2. The problem states GCF 11, so that's impossible. None of the options work. But since this is a multiple choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, let me try to see if there is a number in the options which when paired with 350 gives GCF of 11. Let's check each option:\n\nA)242: GCF with 350 is 2. Not 11.\n\nB)308: GCF is14.\n\nC)352: factors are 2^5\u00d711. 350's factors are 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factors are 2. GCF 2.\n\nD)412: factors 2\u00b2\u00d7103. GCF with 350 is 2.\n\nE)456: factors 2\u00b3\u00d73\u00d719. GCF with 350 is 2.\n\nNone of them have GCF 11 with 350. So the problem is impossible. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's details. Wait, the question says \"the greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11\". So both numbers must be multiples of 11, but 350 isn't. So the question is wrong. But maybe I miscalculated?\n\nWait 350 divided by 11. Let me do 11\u00d731=341, plus 9 is 350. So no. So the problem is impossible. But since I have to choose from the options, maybe the answer is A)242 even though it contradicts GCF? Because that's what the formula gives. Perhaps the question assumes that even if one isn't divisible by 11, but the GCF is 11? Which is impossible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, let me see another approach. Let me suppose that the two numbers are x and 350. Their GCF is 11, so let me write x=11a and 350=11b, where a and b are coprime. Wait, but then 350 must be divisible by 11, which it's not. Therefore this is impossible. So the problem has no solution. But the options are there, so perhaps I have to choose the answer that follows the formula even though it contradicts the GCF. The options don't have another number that fits, so maybe the answer is A)242, even if there's an inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct and I'm missing something. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the GCF is 11, so even if one number isn't a multiple of 11? But that's impossible. The GCF must divide both numbers. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. Therefore, 350 must be a multiple of 11. Since it isn't, the problem is wrong. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers, but since I have to choose, perhaps the answer is A)242, which is what the formula gives, and maybe the GCF was a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me recheck. The formula: GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) = a*b. So 11*7700 =350*x \u2192 84700 =350x \u2192 x=242. That's correct. So the problem must have a mistake. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 242 (A). Maybe the question meant LCM is 7700 and GCF is 2. Then the answer would be correct. But the question says GCF is 11. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the prime factors of 242. Let me see: 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11 squared. So 242 is 2\u00d711\u00b2. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. So GCF is 2. So that's correct. Therefore, the problem's parameters are conflicting, but the options don't have a better answer. Since the formula gives 242 as the answer, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition, maybe that's the answer they expect. Because perhaps the question had a typo and the GCF is 2, but the options don't have another possibility. Alternatively, maybe the question is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that both numbers must be multiples of 11. Wait, the GCF is 11, so that's the highest common factor. So the GCF must divide both numbers, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. Therefore, 350 must be a multiple of 11. Since it isn't, the problem is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but since that's not an option, maybe the closest is A)242, even though it's incorrect. Or perhaps the question had a different number instead of 350?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The problem says the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700. One integer is 350. Find the other. So perhaps there's an error in the problem's numbers, but the answer is A)242. Since that's what the formula gives, even if it contradicts the GCF, maybe that's the expected answer. Because maybe the question assumes that even if the GCF isn't properly considered. Hmm. Well, in an exam setting, perhaps I should go with the formula's answer, since the problem might have an error but the options are given. So the answer would be A)242.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the LCM calculation. Let me see, if the other number is 308 (option B), then LCM of 308 and 350 is 7700. So even though the GCF is 14, the LCM is correct. But the question says GCF is 11. So that's conflicting. But maybe the question mixed up GCF and LCM? Like if GCF was 14 and LCM 7700, then B would be correct. But the question states GCF is 11. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Wait, no, the formula is correct. So I think the problem is wrong, but the answer expected is A)242. So I'll choose A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. Using the formula \\( \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b \\), we calculate the other integer \\( x \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 7700 = 350 \\times x \\implies x = \\frac{11 \\times 7700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nHowever, checking the GCF of 350 and 242, we find it is 2, not 11, which contradicts the problem's condition. Despite this inconsistency, the formula yields 242 as the only mathematically consistent result given the parameters. Since the problem might contain an error or expect strict formulaic application, the answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the other integer when given the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. One of the numbers is 350. Hmm, right. I remember there's a relationship between GCF, LCM, and the two numbers. Oh right, the formula: GCF(a, b) * LCM(a, b) = a * b. So if I can use that here, maybe I can find the missing number.\n\nThe GCF is 11, and the LCM is 7700. One number is 350. Let me denote the other number as x. According to the formula, 11 * 7700 should equal 350 * x. Wait, let me write that down properly. So GCF * LCM = product of the numbers. So 11 * 7700 = 350 * x. Then solving for x would be (11*7700)/350. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let me compute 11 multiplied by 7700. 11*7700. Well, 7700 times 10 is 77,000, plus another 7,700 gives 84,700. So 11*7700 = 84,700. Then divide that by 350. Hmm, 84,700 divided by 350. Let me simplify this. Maybe I can divide numerator and denominator by 10 first to make it 8,470 / 35. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, 350 times 200 is 70,000. 350*242? Wait, maybe breaking it down. Let me see, 350 times 200 is 70,000. 350 times 24 is 8,400. 70,000 + 8,400 = 78,400. Wait, that's over. Hmm, maybe I need to do division step by step.\n\nWait, 84,700 divided by 350. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10: 8470 / 35. Let's compute 35 times 242. Let's see, 35*200 is 7000, 35*40 is 1400, so 35*240 = 8400. Then 35*2 is 70. So 240+2 is 242, so 35*242 = 8470. Oh! So 8470 divided by 35 is exactly 242. So x is 242? That's option A. Wait but let me check again. Because the GCF is 11, so the numbers must be multiples of 11. Let me see. 350 and 242. Let's check their GCF.\n\nWait, 350 divided by 11? Hmm, 11*31 is 341, so 350-341 is 9, so 350 isn't a multiple of 11. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, the GCF of the two numbers is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is one of the numbers. Is 350 divisible by 11? Let me check again. 11*31 is 341, 341 +11=352. So 350 divided by 11 gives 31.81... So it's not a multiple of 11. That can't be right. Wait, so maybe I made a mistake here. Because if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must have 11 as a common factor. But if one of them is 350, which isn't divisible by 11, that would contradict the GCF being 11. Hmm, so I must have messed up.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the question? Let me read again. The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The LCM is 7700. One of the integers is 350. Find the other. Wait, so maybe 350's GCF with the other number is 11. So 350 and the other number must have GCF 11. But if 350 is not divisible by 11, how can their GCF be 11? Because GCF has to divide both numbers. Therefore, this suggests that either the problem is wrong, or I made a mistake in my calculation. Or perhaps I need to check the steps again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula? Let me confirm the formula. The product of the LCM and GCF of two numbers equals the product of the numbers themselves. Yes, that's correct. So LCM(a,b) * GCF(a,b) = a*b. So that part is right. So according to that, if the GCF is 11 and LCM is 7700, then the product of the two numbers is 11 * 7700 = 84700. Then one number is 350, so the other is 84700 / 350 = 242, which is what I got before. But then 242 and 350's GCF must be 11. Let me check that.\n\nLet me compute GCF(350,242). Let's do prime factors. 350 is 2 * 5^2 * 7. 242 is 2 * 121, which is 2 * 11^2. So the common factors are just 2. So the GCF would be 2, not 11. Oh no! That's a problem. That means my answer can't be right because the GCF would be 2, but the problem states it's 11. So where did I go wrong?\n\nHmm, so this suggests that 242 is not the correct answer, even though the formula gives that. Therefore, perhaps the mistake is in assuming that the formula applies here, but maybe there are some constraints. Wait, the formula should hold regardless. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the GCF of 242 and 350?\n\nWait let me recalculate GCF(350,242). The factors of 350 are 2 \u00d75\u00d75\u00d77. The factors of 242 are 2 \u00d711\u00d711. So the only common factor is 2. So their GCF is 2, but the problem says it's 11. Therefore, that can't be. So that means my initial approach must have an error. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, so that's impossible. Wait, so that would mean that either the question is wrong, or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's numbers. Wait, but the problem says that the GCF is 11. So maybe there's a mistake in my calculation?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check the steps again. Let me try again. Let me denote the two numbers as a and b. Given that GCF(a,b)=11, LCM(a,b)=7700, and one of them is 350. Let's suppose a =350, then find b.\n\nWe know that GCF(a,b)=11, so 11 divides both a and b. But 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. 350 /11 is approximately 31.8, so that can't be. Therefore, that suggests that 350 cannot be one of the numbers if their GCF is 11. So that's a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, maybe I need to re-express the numbers in terms of their GCF. Let me think. Let me recall that if the GCF of a and b is 11, then we can write a = 11*m and b=11*n where m and n are integers that are coprime (their GCF is 1). Then the LCM of a and b would be 11*m*n. Because LCM of 11m and 11n is 11*m*n when m and n are coprime.\n\nSo, according to this, LCM(a,b) = 11*m*n = 7700. So m*n = 7700 /11 = 700. And the product a*b is (11m)*(11n)= 121*m*n. But according to the formula, LCM(a,b)*GCF(a,b) = 7700*11 = 84700, which should equal a*b = 121*m*n. Since m*n is 700, 121*700 is 84,700, so that matches. So that's consistent.\n\nNow, one of the numbers is 350. Let's see. Since a is either 11m or 11n. Let's suppose that a = 350 = 11m. Then m would be 350/11, which is not an integer, so that can't be. Alternatively, if a is 350, then it must be that 350 =11*m. Since 350 isn't divisible by 11, that can't be. Therefore, the other number must be 350. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the other way around. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps 350 is not a multiple of 11, so the problem must be that either the question is wrong, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are allowed to have GCF 11 even if one isn't a multiple? No, that's impossible. The GCF must divide both numbers, so both must be multiples of 11. Therefore, 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. Wait, so that's a problem. Therefore, is there a mistake in the problem?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating 350 divided by 11. Let me check again. 11 times 31 is 341, 11\u00d732 is 352. So 350 is between those, so indeed, 350 is not divisible by 11. Therefore, the problem as stated can't have 350 as one of the numbers if their GCF is 11. Unless there's a typo in the problem. But since this is a multiple choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to see if one of the options when paired with 350 gives a GCF of 11 and LCM of 7700. Let me try that approach. Let's check each option.\n\nThe options are A)242, B)308, C)352, D)412, E)456.\n\nLet me check each one:\n\nOption A: 242 and 350.\n\nGCF(242, 350). As before, factors of 242 are 2\u00d711\u00b2, 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factors are 2, so GCF is 2. Not 11. So no.\n\nOption B:308. Let's compute GCF(308, 350).\n\nFactorize 308: 4 \u00d777 = 4\u00d77\u00d711. So 2\u00b2\u00d77\u00d711.\n\n350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. So common factors are 2 and 7. So GCF is 14. Not 11.\n\nOption C: 352. Let's see.\n\n352 divided by 11? 11\u00d732=352. So 352 is 11\u00d732. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Let's find GCF(352, 350).\n\nPrime factors of 352: 11\u00d732=11\u00d72^5. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factors are 2. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nHmm, that's not right.\n\nOption D:412. Let's see.\n\n412 divided by 11? 11\u00d737 is 407, 412-407=5. So not divisible by 11. So GCF would be GCD(412, 350). Let's factorize 412. 4\u00d7103? 4\u00d7103 is 412. 103 is a prime? 103 divided by 2,3,5,7,11? 11\u00d79=99, 103-99=4, so no. So 412 is 2\u00b2\u00d7103. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factor is 2. GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption E:456. Let's check.\n\n456 divided by 11? 11\u00d741 is 451. 456-451=5, so not divisible by 11. GCF(456,350). 456 factors: 8\u00d757 = 8\u00d73\u00d719. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factor is 2. GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nHmm, so none of the options when paired with 350 have a GCF of 11. That's a problem. But the question says the GCF is 11. So either all options are wrong, which is unlikely, or I made a mistake in my reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula approach. Let me think again. The formula says LCM * GCF = product of numbers. So if the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700, then product is 11 *7700 =84700. So one number is 350, so the other is 84700 /350 =242. But then the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that contradicts the given GCF. So this suggests that the problem has conflicting numbers. But the options don't have a number that when paired with 350 gives GCF 11 and LCM 7700. So perhaps there's an error in the problem's numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating LCM. Let me check LCM(350,242). LCM is (350*242)/GCF(350,242). GCF is 2. So LCM is (350\u00d7242)/2 = (350\u00d7121). 350\u00d7121. Let's see, 350\u00d7100=35000, 350\u00d720=7000, 350\u00d71=350. So total is 35000+7000=42000 +350=42350. But the problem states LCM is 7700, which is way smaller. So that's not matching. Therefore, the answer must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in the formula? Let me double-check. The formula is correct. LCM(a,b) * GCF(a,b) = a*b. So if the given numbers are correct, then there must be an error here. Alternatively, maybe the question is correct and I'm missing something?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the numbers are 11 times something. Let me try the approach where a =11m and b=11n, with m and n coprime. Then LCM(a,b)=11*m*n =7700. So m*n =7700/11=700. And since a is 350, which is 11m, so 11m =350 \u2192 m=350/11. But that's not an integer, so that can't be. Alternatively, perhaps the other number is 11m, so if a is 350, then 350 =11*m, which again gives m non-integer. So that's impossible. Therefore, the problem is impossible as given?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. Wait, but the options are given. Let me see if any of the options when paired with 350 gives GCF 11 and LCM 7700. Let me try option B:308.\n\nCompute GCF(308,350). As before, factors of 308 are 2\u00d72\u00d77\u00d711. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00d75\u00d77. So GCF is 2\u00d77=14. LCM would be (308\u00d7350)/14 = (308/14)*350 =22*350= 7700. Wait a second! Oh! Wait, the LCM here is exactly 7700. So even though the GCF is 14, which is not 11, but the LCM is 7700. But the problem states GCF is 11, so that's conflicting. So this option gives LCM correct but GCF wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait, let me check option C:352. GCF(352,350). 352 is 2^5\u00d711. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. So GCF is 2. LCM would be (352\u00d7350)/2 = (352\u00d7175) = let's see, 350\u00d7352= 350*(350+2) = 350\u00b2 + 700 = 122500 +700= 123200. Divide by 2 gives 61600. Which is way bigger than 7700. Not correct.\n\nWait, what about option B's LCM? Let me recalculate that. 308 and 350. LCM is (308 \u00d7350)/14 = (308/14)*350 =22 \u00d7350 = 7700. So yes, LCM is correct. But GCF is 14, not 11. So that's not matching the problem's GCF of 11. So that's not the answer.\n\nHmm. Option D:412 and 350. GCF is 2. LCM is (412\u00d7350)/2 =412\u00d7175. Let's see, 400\u00d7175=70,000, 12\u00d7175=2,100 \u2192 total 72,100. Not 7700.\n\nOption E:456 and 350. GCF is 2. LCM is (456\u00d7350)/2 =456\u00d7175. 400\u00d7175=70,000, 56\u00d7175=9,800 \u2192 total 79,800. Not 7700.\n\nHmm, so option B gives LCM correct but GCF wrong, others are worse. So what's going on here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is correct, but I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again the first approach. The formula says LCM * GCF = product. So if the GCF is 11 and LCM is 7700, then the product is 84700. 350 times the other number must be 84700. So other number is 84700 /350 = 242. But that gives GCF 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait, perhaps the question has a typo and the GCF is 14, then option B would be correct. Or maybe the LCM is different. Alternatively, maybe the other number is 242, but the GCF is 2, so the question is wrong. But since this is a problem given to me, I need to pick from the options. Maybe I made a mistake in the GCF calculation between 242 and 350?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate GCF(242,350):\n\n242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11\u00b2. 350 divided by 2 is 175. So the GCF is 2. So that's correct. So the problem is conflicting. Unless there's an alternative way.\n\nWait, maybe the question meant that the GCF is 11, but one of the numbers is 350, which is not divisible by 11, so that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but that's not listed. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's parameters?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct and I'm missing a step. Let me think differently. Let me try to represent the numbers as multiples of the GCF. Let me denote the two numbers as 11a and 11b, where a and b are coprime (since we factored out the GCF). Then LCM of 11a and 11b is 11ab (since a and b are coprime). According to the problem, LCM is 7700. So 11ab =7700 \u2192 ab= 700. Also, the two numbers are 11a and 11b. One of them is 350. So either 11a =350 or 11b=350. Let's see:\n\nCase 1: 11a =350 \u2192 a=350/11 \u224831.818... Not integer. Impossible.\n\nCase 2: 11b=350 \u2192 same problem. So neither case is possible. Thus, there is no solution under the given conditions. But the options are given. Hmm.\n\nThis suggests that the problem has conflicting parameters. However, the options include 242 which would be the other number via the formula, but that gives GCF 2. Alternatively, maybe the question intended the GCF to be 14, then the correct answer would be B (308). Or maybe I made a mistake in the problem's numbers. Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in the problem's LCM?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the formula. Wait, the formula is definitely correct. Let me think of another approach. Let me list the factors.\n\nSuppose the two numbers are x and 350, GCF(x,350)=11, LCM(x,350)=7700. Since GCF is 11, then both x and 350 must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11, so that's impossible. Therefore the problem is invalid. But since the options are given, maybe I need to pick the closest one which gives LCM correct even if GCF is different? Like option B gives LCM correct but GCF 14. But the question specifies GCF is 11. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the GCF for option B. Let me recheck:\n\n308 and 350. Let's compute GCF step by step. \n\n308 divided by 14 is 22, 350 divided by 14 is 25. So 14 is a common factor. Let me see if there's a higher common factor. 308 \u00f7 2 = 154, 350 \u00f72=175. GCF of 154 and 175. 154 factors: 2\u00d77\u00d711. 175:5\u00b2\u00d77. Common factor is 7. So GCF is 2\u00d77=14. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so I'm stuck. The formula gives 242 but that has GCF 2. The problem states GCF 11, so that's impossible. None of the options work. But since this is a multiple choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, let me try to see if there is a number in the options which when paired with 350 gives GCF of 11. Let's check each option:\n\nA)242: GCF with 350 is 2. Not 11.\n\nB)308: GCF is14.\n\nC)352: factors are 2^5\u00d711. 350's factors are 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factors are 2. GCF 2.\n\nD)412: factors 2\u00b2\u00d7103. GCF with 350 is 2.\n\nE)456: factors 2\u00b3\u00d73\u00d719. GCF with 350 is 2.\n\nNone of them have GCF 11 with 350. So the problem is impossible. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's details. Wait, the question says \"the greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11\". So both numbers must be multiples of 11, but 350 isn't. So the question is wrong. But maybe I miscalculated?\n\nWait 350 divided by 11. Let me do 11\u00d731=341, plus 9 is 350. So no. So the problem is impossible. But since I have to choose from the options, maybe the answer is A)242 even though it contradicts GCF? Because that's what the formula gives. Perhaps the question assumes that even if one isn't divisible by 11, but the GCF is 11? Which is impossible. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, let me see another approach. Let me suppose that the two numbers are x and 350. Their GCF is 11, so let me write x=11a and 350=11b, where a and b are coprime. Wait, but then 350 must be divisible by 11, which it's not. Therefore this is impossible. So the problem has no solution. But the options are there, so perhaps I have to choose the answer that follows the formula even though it contradicts the GCF. The options don't have another number that fits, so maybe the answer is A)242, even if there's an inconsistency.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct and I'm missing something. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the GCF is 11, so even if one number isn't a multiple of 11? But that's impossible. The GCF must divide both numbers. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. Therefore, 350 must be a multiple of 11. Since it isn't, the problem is wrong. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers, but since I have to choose, perhaps the answer is A)242, which is what the formula gives, and maybe the GCF was a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me recheck. The formula: GCF(a,b)*LCM(a,b) = a*b. So 11*7700 =350*x \u2192 84700 =350x \u2192 x=242. That's correct. So the problem must have a mistake. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is 242 (A). Maybe the question meant LCM is 7700 and GCF is 2. Then the answer would be correct. But the question says GCF is 11. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the prime factors of 242. Let me see: 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11 squared. So 242 is 2\u00d711\u00b2. 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. So GCF is 2. So that's correct. Therefore, the problem's parameters are conflicting, but the options don't have a better answer. Since the formula gives 242 as the answer, even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition, maybe that's the answer they expect. Because perhaps the question had a typo and the GCF is 2, but the options don't have another possibility. Alternatively, maybe the question is correct and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that both numbers must be multiples of 11. Wait, the GCF is 11, so that's the highest common factor. So the GCF must divide both numbers, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. Therefore, 350 must be a multiple of 11. Since it isn't, the problem is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is none of the options, but since that's not an option, maybe the closest is A)242, even though it's incorrect. Or perhaps the question had a different number instead of 350?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The problem says the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700. One integer is 350. Find the other. So perhaps there's an error in the problem's numbers, but the answer is A)242. Since that's what the formula gives, even if it contradicts the GCF, maybe that's the expected answer. Because maybe the question assumes that even if the GCF isn't properly considered. Hmm. Well, in an exam setting, perhaps I should go with the formula's answer, since the problem might have an error but the options are given. So the answer would be A)242.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the LCM calculation. Let me see, if the other number is 308 (option B), then LCM of 308 and 350 is 7700. So even though the GCF is 14, the LCM is correct. But the question says GCF is 11. So that's conflicting. But maybe the question mixed up GCF and LCM? Like if GCF was 14 and LCM 7700, then B would be correct. But the question states GCF is 11. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula. Wait, no, the formula is correct. So I think the problem is wrong, but the answer expected is A)242. So I'll choose A.\n\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. Using the formula \\( \\text{GCF}(a, b) \\times \\text{LCM}(a, b) = a \\times b \\), we calculate the other integer \\( x \\) as follows:\n\n\\[\n11 \\times 7700 = 350 \\times x \\implies x = \\frac{11 \\times 7700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nHowever, checking the GCF of 350 and 242, we find it is 2, not 11, which contradicts the problem's condition. Despite this inconsistency, the formula yields 242 as the only mathematically consistent result given the parameters. Since the problem might contain an error or expect strict formulaic application, the answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. The question is about finding the other integer when given the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. One of the numbers is 350. The GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700. Hmm, let me think how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that there's a relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the numbers are a and b, then a \u00d7 b = GCF(a,b) \u00d7 LCM(a,b). That formula should be useful here.\n\nLet me write that down. Let the two numbers be x and y. Given that GCF(x, y) = 11 and LCM(x, y) = 7700. One of the numbers is 350, so let's say x = 350. We need to find y.\n\nAccording to the formula: x * y = GCF * LCM. Plugging in the numbers: 350 * y = 11 * 7700. \n\nWait, let me compute the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, so 11*700 is 7700. Wait no, that's just 7700. Wait, 11 multiplied by 7700 would actually be 11*7700. Wait, hold on. Wait, no, the formula is GCF times LCM equals product of the numbers. So 11 *7700 is indeed the product. So 350 multiplied by y equals 11*7700.\n\nSo, solving for y would be (11 *7700)/350. Let me compute that. Let me see, maybe simplify the fractions first. Let's see, 7700 divided by 350. Hmm, 350 times 22 is 7700, right? Because 350*20 is 7000, plus 350*2 is 700, so total 7700. So 7700 / 350 = 22. So then 11 multiplied by that 22 would be 242. Wait, so 11 *22 is 242. So then y is 242? But wait, that would be option A. But wait, I need to check if that's correct.\n\nWait a second, but I remember that the GCF of the two numbers is 11. Let me confirm if 350 and 242 have a GCF of 11. Let me check that.\n\nFirst, let's find the GCF of 350 and 242. Let's break them down into prime factors.\n\n350 factors: 2 \u00d7 5\u00b2 \u00d7 7. Because 350 divided by 2 is 175, which is 5\u00d735, so 5\u00d75\u00d77.\n\n242: Let's see, 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11 squared. So 242 is 2 \u00d7 11\u00b2.\n\nSo the common factors between them are the primes they share. Both have a 2. The GCF is the product of the lowest powers of the common primes. So the GCF here would be 2. But the problem states that the GCF is 11. Oh no! That means my answer is wrong. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nHmm, so maybe my initial approach was missing something. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe GCF is 11, but when I calculated y as 242, the GCF between 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation or the approach.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the formula is correct, but maybe there's another condition here. Let me think again. The formula is correct: product of numbers equals GCF times LCM. So that part should be right. So why is the GCF not 11?\n\nAh, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate. Let me do the division again.\n\nWait, so according to the formula:\n\ny = (GCF * LCM) / x = (11 * 7700) / 350.\n\nLet me compute 11*7700 first. 11 times 7000 is 77000, and 11*700 is 7700, so total 77000 + 7700? Wait no, that's not right. Wait 7700 is the LCM. 11 multiplied by 7700 is 11*7700. Let me compute that as 7700*10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. So 11 *7700 = 84,700.\n\nThen divide that by 350. So 84700 divided by 350.\n\nLet me see, 350 \u00d7 242 is 350*200=70,000 and 350\u00d742=14,700. 70,000+14,700=84,700. So yes, 242 is the result. But then why is the GCF 2?\n\nHmm. That suggests that there's an error in the problem's options, but that's unlikely. Maybe my mistake is in the prime factors?\n\nWait, 350's prime factors are 2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77. 242 is 2 \u00d7 11\u00b2. The common factor is 2, so GCF is 2. So that's conflicting with the problem's given GCF of 11. So that means my answer must be wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the problem again. Let me read the question again:\n\n\"The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\"\n\nHmm. So the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. Wait, but 350 divided by 11? Let me check if 11 divides 350. 11 \u00d7 31 is 341, 11\u00d732 is 352. So 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. That's a problem. Wait a minute, that's a big problem here!\n\nWait, the GCF of the two numbers is 11. Therefore, both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 isn't divisible by 11. That can't be possible. Wait, so is there a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps I made a mistake in reading the numbers?\n\nWait, the question says that one of the integers is 350. But if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, because 11 \u00d731 is 341, 341 +11 is 352. So 350 mod 11 is 9? So that's impossible. So that suggests that maybe there is a mistake in the problem's numbers, but that's probably not the case. Maybe I need to re-examine my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the formula. Let me think again. The formula is correct: product of numbers equals GCF times LCM. But if one number is 350 and the GCF is 11, then 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. Therefore, that's impossible. So that would mean that either the problem is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of GCF. Let me check again. Let me see, the problem states that GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818... which is not an integer. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's numbers?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the LCM? The LCM is 7700. Let me check that again. The LCM of 350 and the other number is 7700. Let me see: 350 factors into 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. The LCM with another number is 7700. Let me factor 7700. 7700 divided by 100 is 77, so 7700 is 77 \u00d7 100. 77 is 7\u00d711, and 100 is 2\u00b2\u00d75\u00b2. So altogether, 2\u00b2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77 \u00d711. So the LCM is 2\u00b2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77 \u00d711.\n\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So, if one number is 350 (2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77), the other number must contribute the remaining factors. The LCM has 2\u00b2, so the other number must have 2^1 or 2^2? Let's see. The LCM's 2 is to the power of 2, so since one number has 2^1, the other must have at least 2^1 to get to 2^2? Or maybe the other has 2^2. Either way, the LCM's exponent is the max of the exponents from each number.\n\nSo, the other number could have 2^2. The LCM's 5 is 5^2, so the other number can have up to 5^2. The 7 is already in 350, so the other can have 7^0. The 11 must come from the other number because 350 doesn't have any 11. Since the GCF is 11, which is 11^1, so both numbers must have at least 11^1. But 350 doesn't have 11. Wait, that's the problem again.\n\nAh! Here's the problem. The GCF is 11, so both numbers must have 11 as a common factor. But 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor. Therefore, this is impossible. Which suggests that either the problem is wrong, or maybe I made a mistake in the question's numbers?\n\nWait, perhaps the question was stated correctly. Let me check again. The problem says the GCF is 11, LCM 7700, one number is 350. Hmm. Maybe there's a typo in the problem? Like maybe the GCF is 35 instead? Or the LCM is different?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct and I need to see where I'm wrong. Wait, perhaps I should think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula still holds, but the GCF is 11 even if one number isn't a multiple? No, that can't be. The GCF is the greatest common factor. So if one number isn't divisible by 11, then the GCF can't be 11. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is wrong. But since it's an exam question, perhaps I made a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to re-express the numbers in terms of their GCF.\n\nAnother approach: Let me denote the two numbers as 11a and 11b, where a and b are coprime (since we've factored out the GCF). Then the LCM of the two numbers would be 11ab. Because LCM of 11a and 11b is 11 times LCM(a,b), and since a and b are coprime, LCM(a,b) is ab. So LCM is 11ab.\n\nGiven that the LCM is 7700, so 11ab =7700 \u2192 ab = 700.\n\nAlso, one of the numbers is 350, which is 11a or 11b. Let's see, 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which is not an integer, so that can't be. Wait, so that would mean that 350 must be equal to either 11a or 11b, but since it's not divisible by 11, that's impossible. So this suggests that the problem is impossible as stated. But that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in this approach?\n\nWait, let me see again. The two numbers must be multiples of 11. Since their GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So the problem is contradictory. Therefore, perhaps the answer is none of the options, but that's not an option here. So there must be something wrong with my reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula when using the GCF and LCM. Let me confirm again. The formula says that for any two numbers, GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. That's correct. So if the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700, then a*b = 11 *7700 = 84700. If one of the numbers is 350, then the other is 84700 /350 = 242. But then the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps the question has a typo. Like maybe the GCF is 2 instead of 11? But that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the other number is 350, but no, the question says one of them is 350. Wait, maybe I need to check the options again. Let's look at the options:\n\nA)242\n\nB)308\n\nC)352\n\nD)412\n\nE)456\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the GCF for 350 and 242. Let me check that again. Let me compute GCD(350,242).\n\n350 divided by 2 is 175, 242 divided by 2 is 121. So 2 is a common factor. Then GCD(175,121). 175 factors into 5\u00b2\u00d77. 121 is 11\u00b2. So they have no common factors except 1. So GCD is 2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm. So the problem as stated has no solution because 350 is not a multiple of 11, making the GCF of 11 impossible. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is correct, and I need to see another way. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, but I have a mistake in the prime factors. Let me check 350 again. 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 divided by 5 is 35, divided by 5 again is 7. So yes, 2\u00d75\u00d75\u00d77. So no 11 there. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says the GCF is 11, but the LCM is 7700. Let me see if any of the options when paired with 350 give GCF 11 and LCM 7700.\n\nLet me try option B: 308.\n\nFirst, check GCF(350, 308). Let's see.\n\n350 factors: 2 \u00d75\u00b2\u00d77.\n\n308: 308 divided by 2 is 154, divided by 2 is 77. 77 is 7\u00d711. So factors are 2\u00b2 \u00d77\u00d711.\n\nSo common factors between 350 and 308:\n\nThe primes in common are 2 and 7.\n\nThe GCF would be the minimum exponents for each common prime.\n\nFor 2: min(1,2)=1 \u2192 2^1\n\nFor 7: min(1,1)=1 \u2192 7^1\n\nSo GCF is 2\u00d77=14. Not 11. So that's not the answer.\n\nOption C:352.\n\n352 divided by 2 is 176, divided by 2 is 88, divided by 2 is 44, divided by 2 is 22, divided by 2 is 11. So 352 is 2^6 \u00d711.\n\n350 is 2 \u00d75\u00b2\u00d77.\n\nCommon factors are 2^1. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412. Let's factor 412.\n\nDivide by 2: 206. Again by 2:103. 103 is a prime (since 103 divided by primes up to sqrt(103) ~10.1, so check 2,3,5,7. 103/3 is 34.3, etc. So 412 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7103.\n\n350's factors are 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. So common factor is 2. GCF is 2.\n\nOption E:456. Let's factor that.\n\n456 divided by 2 is 228, divided by 2 is 114, divided by 2 is 57. 57 is 3\u00d719. So 456 is 2\u00b3 \u00d73\u00d719.\n\n350's factors are 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factor is 2. GCF is 2.\n\nHmm, none of the options except A (242) have GCF with 350 as higher than 2. But 242 gives GCF 2, which doesn't match the problem's GCF of 11. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, but the problem says the GCF is 11, so perhaps I made a mistake in the options? Wait, let me check option B again. 308's factors include 11? Yes, 308 is 2\u00b2\u00d77\u00d711. So GCF with 350 would be 2\u00d77=14. Not 11. So not that.\n\nHmm. Wait, maybe the problem is correct, but I need to see what's going on here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the answer is option B, but I made a mistake in the GCF calculation?\n\nWait, let's recalculate the GCF of 350 and 308 again.\n\n350: 2\u00d75\u00d75\u00d77\n\n308: 2\u00d72\u00d77\u00d711\n\nSo common primes: 2 and 7. The minimum exponents for 2 is 1 (since 350 has 2^1 and 308 has 2^2) \u2192 2^1.\n\nFor 7, both have 7^1. So GCF is 2\u00d77=14. So that's not 11. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to see if there's a different approach here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, so even if the GCF comes out to be different, but the problem states that the GCF is 11, so maybe the problem is wrong? But since this is a question from a test, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to see which of the options, when paired with 350, gives LCM of 7700 and GCF of 11. Let me check each option.\n\nTake option B:308.\n\nCompute GCF(350,308)=14, LCM(350,308). Let me compute LCM.\n\nThe LCM formula: (350\u00d7308)/GCF(350,308) = (350\u00d7308)/14.\n\n350 divided by 14 is 25. 25 \u00d7308 = 7700. So LCM is 7700. Oh! Wait a second! So even though the GCF is 14, the LCM is indeed 7700. But the problem says the GCF is 11, so this is not the answer. But the LCM matches here. Hmm, interesting.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the GCF is 11, so that's conflicting. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but the problem has a typo? Or maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, let's check option C:352.\n\nGCF(350,352). Let's compute.\n\n350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77, 352 is 2^6\u00d711. Common prime is 2. So GCF is 2. LCM would be (350\u00d7352)/2 = 350\u00d7176 = 61,600. Which is way higher than 7700. So not that.\n\nOption D:412. GCF(350,412)=2, LCM would be (350\u00d7412)/2 = 350\u00d7206= 72,100. Not 7700.\n\nOption E:456. GCF is 2. LCM is (350\u00d7456)/2 = 350\u00d7228 = 79,800. No.\n\nOption A:242. GCF 2, LCM is (350\u00d7242)/2 = 350\u00d7121 = 42,350. Not 7700. Wait, but earlier calculation said that 350\u00d7242 is 84,700? Wait, no. Wait, 350\u00d7242. Let me compute that again. 350\u00d7200 is 70,000, 350\u00d740 is 14,000, 350\u00d72 is 700. So total is 70,000+14,000=84,000 +700=84,700. Then divided by GCF (2) gives LCM of 42,350. But the problem says LCM is 7700, so that's not it.\n\nHmm. So the only option that gives LCM of 7700 is option B (308). But then its GCF is 14, which is different from the problem's 11. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the problem has swapped GCF and LCM? If the GCF was 14 and LCM 7700, then 308 would be the answer. But the problem says GCF is 11. Alternatively, maybe the given LCM is incorrect? Or perhaps the problem wants another approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the formula is GCF(a,b) \u00d7 LCM(a,b) = a \u00d7 b. So in the case of option B (308 and 350):\n\nGCF(350,308) is 14, LCM is 7700. 14 \u00d77700 = 107,800. But 350\u00d7308 is 107,800. So that's correct. So the formula holds here, but the problem states GCF is 11, so that's not the case.\n\nHmm. So this is a problem. The options don't have any number which when paired with 350 gives GCF of 11. Because 350 isn't divisible by 11. Therefore, maybe the question has an error, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the question says that one of the integers is 350, but perhaps the other is a multiple of 11, and the GCF is 11 even if 350 isn't a multiple? That can't be. The GCF must divide both numbers. So if the GCF is 11, then 11 must divide both numbers. But 350 is not divisible by 11, so that's impossible. So the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nBut since it's a multiple choice question with options given, perhaps the answer is A (242) even though the GCF is wrong, but maybe I made a mistake in the GCF calculation?\n\nWait, let me check the GCF of 242 and 350 again. 242 is 2\u00d711\u00b2, 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factors are 2. So GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. So this is perplexing. Maybe I made a mistake in reading the question. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. LCM is 7700. One of the integers is 350. What is the other?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. If the GCF is 14, then the other number is 308 (option B), which would give LCM 7700. So that's possible. Maybe the GCF was supposed to be 14?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the LCM was supposed to be 42,350 for option A, but that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct and I need to see another approach. Let me try again.\n\nLet me suppose that the two numbers are 350 and x. GCF is 11, LCM is 7700.\n\nWe know that:\n\nGCF(350, x) = 11 \u21d2 11 divides both 350 and x. But 350 divided by 11 gives a non-integer, so this is impossible. Hence, there's no solution. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the formula holds?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct but there's a different approach. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as 11a and 11b where a and b are coprime (since we've factored out the GCF). Then, their LCM is 11ab. Since LCM is 7700, so 11ab =7700 \u21d2 ab=700.\n\nAlso, one of the numbers is 350. So either 11a=350 or 11b=350.\n\nLet me check 11a =350 \u2192 a=350/11 \u224831.818\u2026 which is not an integer. So that can't be. So the other case: 11b=350 \u2192 b=350/11, which is also not an integer. So neither case works. Hence, there is no solution. But the problem gives options, so this must mean that I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are not required to be multiples of the GCF? But that's impossible because the GCF divides both numbers.\n\nHmm. This is really confusing. Since the options are given and the problem is presented, perhaps I need to consider that maybe there's a mistake in the problem, but the closest possible answer is 242, even though the GCF is wrong, but maybe I made an error?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is correct, but I made a mistake in the calculation of LCM and GCF?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should recheck the LCM for 350 and 242. Let me see:\n\nThe LCM of 350 and 242.\n\nFactors of 350: 2 \u00d75\u00b2\u00d77.\n\nFactors of 242: 2 \u00d711\u00b2.\n\nThe LCM takes the highest exponents: 2^1 (since both have 2^1?), wait 242 has 2^1. 350 has 2^1. So LCM's 2^1. 5\u00b2, 7^1, and 11^2. So LCM is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77\u00d711\u00b2. Let me compute that:\n\n2\u00d725 is 50, 50\u00d77=350, 350\u00d7121 (since 11\u00b2 is 121). 350\u00d7121. Let me compute that: 350\u00d7120 =42,000 plus 350\u00d71=350 \u2192 total 42,350. Which matches the previous calculation. So LCM is 42,350, but the problem states it's 7700. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. So none of the options work. But since this is a multiple-choice question, there must be an answer. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different when numbers are not co-prime? No, the formula holds for any two numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a different interpretation? Like maybe the numbers are in a different base? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant the greatest common divisor is 11 and least common multiple is 7700, and one number is 350. Then, the other number is 242. But the problem states GCF is 11, but that's not possible. But since the options are given, maybe the question had a mistake in the GCF and the answer is 242 (option A). Or perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated GCF of 242 and 350.\n\nLet me try using the Euclidean algorithm to find GCF(350,242).\n\nStep 1: 350 divided by 242 is 1 with remainder 108 (350-242=108).\n\nStep 2: 242 divided by 108 is 2 with remainder 26 (242-2\u00d7108 =26).\n\nStep 3: 108 divided by 26 is 4 with remainder 4 (108-4\u00d726=4).\n\nStep 4: 26 divided by 4 is 6 with remainder 2.\n\nStep 5: 4 divided by 2 is 2 with remainder 0.\n\nSo the GCF is 2. So that's correct. So that's not 11.\n\nHmm. So I'm stuck. The only possibility is that the question has an error. But since it's a test question, perhaps I need to choose the option that satisfies LCM=7700 even if GCF is different? But the question says the GCF is 11. So the correct answer must have GCF 11. But none of the options do.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula? Let me see again:\n\nThe formula is a\u00d7b = GCF(a,b) \u00d7 LCM(a,b). So given that, the other number would be (11\u00d77700)/350 = (84700)/350 = 242. But this gives the wrong GCF. So perhaps the question is correct, but the GCF is 11 and LCM 7700, but one number is 350. Then the other number is 242, but the GCF is actually 2. So this is conflicting. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but the answer is A?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct, but the numbers are allowed to have GCF 11 even if one isn't a multiple? But that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the GCF is 11, so the other number must be a multiple of 11, and 350 must also be a multiple of 11. But since it's not, perhaps the question intended one of the numbers to be 330 (which is 30\u00d711) instead of 350? Because 330 is a multiple of 11. Then, the other number would be (11\u00d77700)/330 = 11\u00d77700/330 = 11\u00d7(7700/330). 7700 divided by 330 is 23.333\u2026? Wait, 330\u00d723 is 7590, plus 110 is 7700. So 23 + (110/330) \u2192 23.333, so 7700/330 = 23.333\u2026 which is 70/3. So 11\u00d770/3 = 770/3 \u2248256.666, not an integer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the number was 385 (which is 35\u00d711), then the other number would be (11\u00d77700)/385 = (84700)/385 = 220. Which is an integer. Then GCF of 385 and 220. 385 is 5\u00d77\u00d711. 220 is 2\u00b2\u00d75\u00d711. GCF is 5\u00d711=55. Not 11. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first number is 220 and second is 385? GCF(220,385)=55, LCM= 2\u00d72\u00d75\u00d77\u00d711 = 1540. Not 7700.\n\nHmm, this is going nowhere. I think the problem is faulty. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is A (242), even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant that the GCF is 22? Let me check. If GCF is 22, then the other number would be (22\u00d77700)/350 = (169,400)/350 = 484. But 484 isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the GCF is 35? Let me see. Then the other number is (35\u00d77700)/350 = 7700/10 = 770. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different LCM. If LCM was 42,350, then the answer would be 242. But the LCM is given as 7700.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recheck:\n\nThe question says GCF is 11, LCM is 7700. One number is 350. So other number is (11\u00d77700)/350 = (11\u00d77700)/350. Let me compute that again:\n\n7700 divided by 350 is 22. So 11\u00d722 = 242. So that's correct. So the answer must be 242 (option A). Even though the GCF is 2 instead of 11. So perhaps the question has a mistake in the GCF value, but the answer is A. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think of the numbers 350 and 242.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is correct, but I'm missing that the GCF is 11, so maybe the numbers are 350 and 242, but their GCF is 11. But my calculation shows it's 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of GCF? No, that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a different base? Like base 10 vs base 12? That's unlikely.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Since the formula gives 242 as the answer, and that's an option, perhaps the question intended that, and the GCF is a mistake. So the answer must be A. But the problem states the GCF is 11. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the LCM is 7700 divided by 11? No, that's not right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant to say that the greatest common factor is 2, but that's not the case. I think the problem is incorrect, but since the options are there, I have to choose the one that fits the formula, which is A)242. So I'll go with that.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. To find the other integer, we use the relationship between GCF and LCM: the product of the two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM. \n\nLet the two numbers be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), where \\( x = 350 \\).

This contradiction suggests an inconsistency in the problem's parameters. Despite this, the calculation using the formula yields 242, which is an option (A). Since the problem might contain an error but requires selecting from the given options, the answer derived via the formula is the only valid choice.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here. The question is about finding the other integer when given the greatest common factor (GCF) and the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. One of the numbers is 350. The GCF is 11 and the LCM is 7700. Hmm, let me think how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that there's a relationship between the GCF and LCM of two numbers. Oh right! The product of the two numbers is equal to the product of their GCF and LCM. So, if the numbers are a and b, then a \u00d7 b = GCF(a,b) \u00d7 LCM(a,b). That formula should be useful here.\n\nLet me write that down. Let the two numbers be x and y. Given that GCF(x, y) = 11 and LCM(x, y) = 7700. One of the numbers is 350, so let's say x = 350. We need to find y.\n\nAccording to the formula: x * y = GCF * LCM. Plugging in the numbers: 350 * y = 11 * 7700. \n\nWait, let me compute the right side first. 11 multiplied by 7700. Let's see, 7700 divided by 11 is 700, so 11*700 is 7700. Wait no, that's just 7700. Wait, 11 multiplied by 7700 would actually be 11*7700. Wait, hold on. Wait, no, the formula is GCF times LCM equals product of the numbers. So 11 *7700 is indeed the product. So 350 multiplied by y equals 11*7700.\n\nSo, solving for y would be (11 *7700)/350. Let me compute that. Let me see, maybe simplify the fractions first. Let's see, 7700 divided by 350. Hmm, 350 times 22 is 7700, right? Because 350*20 is 7000, plus 350*2 is 700, so total 7700. So 7700 / 350 = 22. So then 11 multiplied by that 22 would be 242. Wait, so 11 *22 is 242. So then y is 242? But wait, that would be option A. But wait, I need to check if that's correct.\n\nWait a second, but I remember that the GCF of the two numbers is 11. Let me confirm if 350 and 242 have a GCF of 11. Let me check that.\n\nFirst, let's find the GCF of 350 and 242. Let's break them down into prime factors.\n\n350 factors: 2 \u00d7 5\u00b2 \u00d7 7. Because 350 divided by 2 is 175, which is 5\u00d735, so 5\u00d75\u00d77.\n\n242: Let's see, 242 divided by 2 is 121, which is 11 squared. So 242 is 2 \u00d7 11\u00b2.\n\nSo the common factors between them are the primes they share. Both have a 2. The GCF is the product of the lowest powers of the common primes. So the GCF here would be 2. But the problem states that the GCF is 11. Oh no! That means my answer is wrong. Hmm, so where did I go wrong?\n\nHmm, so maybe my initial approach was missing something. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe GCF is 11, but when I calculated y as 242, the GCF between 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation or the approach.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the formula is correct, but maybe there's another condition here. Let me think again. The formula is correct: product of numbers equals GCF times LCM. So that part should be right. So why is the GCF not 11?\n\nAh, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate. Let me do the division again.\n\nWait, so according to the formula:\n\ny = (GCF * LCM) / x = (11 * 7700) / 350.\n\nLet me compute 11*7700 first. 11 times 7000 is 77000, and 11*700 is 7700, so total 77000 + 7700? Wait no, that's not right. Wait 7700 is the LCM. 11 multiplied by 7700 is 11*7700. Let me compute that as 7700*10 is 77000, plus 7700 is 84700. So 11 *7700 = 84,700.\n\nThen divide that by 350. So 84700 divided by 350.\n\nLet me see, 350 \u00d7 242 is 350*200=70,000 and 350\u00d742=14,700. 70,000+14,700=84,700. So yes, 242 is the result. But then why is the GCF 2?\n\nHmm. That suggests that there's an error in the problem's options, but that's unlikely. Maybe my mistake is in the prime factors?\n\nWait, 350's prime factors are 2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77. 242 is 2 \u00d7 11\u00b2. The common factor is 2, so GCF is 2. So that's conflicting with the problem's given GCF of 11. So that means my answer must be wrong. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check the problem again. Let me read the question again:\n\n\"The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. The least common multiple of these two integers is 7700. If one of the integers is 350, what is the other?\"\n\nHmm. So the GCF is 11, so both numbers must be multiples of 11. Wait, but 350 divided by 11? Let me check if 11 divides 350. 11 \u00d7 31 is 341, 11\u00d732 is 352. So 350 divided by 11 is not an integer. That's a problem. Wait a minute, that's a big problem here!\n\nWait, the GCF of the two numbers is 11. Therefore, both numbers must be divisible by 11. But 350 isn't divisible by 11. That can't be possible. Wait, so is there a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps I made a mistake in reading the numbers?\n\nWait, the question says that one of the integers is 350. But if the GCF is 11, then both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 is not a multiple of 11, because 11 \u00d731 is 341, 341 +11 is 352. So 350 mod 11 is 9? So that's impossible. So that suggests that maybe there is a mistake in the problem's numbers, but that's probably not the case. Maybe I need to re-examine my approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the formula. Let me think again. The formula is correct: product of numbers equals GCF times LCM. But if one number is 350 and the GCF is 11, then 350 must be a multiple of 11. But it's not. Therefore, that's impossible. So that would mean that either the problem is wrong, or I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of GCF. Let me check again. Let me see, the problem states that GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. So 350 must be a multiple of 11. But 350 divided by 11 is 31.818... which is not an integer. Therefore, this is a contradiction. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's numbers?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the LCM? The LCM is 7700. Let me check that again. The LCM of 350 and the other number is 7700. Let me see: 350 factors into 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. The LCM with another number is 7700. Let me factor 7700. 7700 divided by 100 is 77, so 7700 is 77 \u00d7 100. 77 is 7\u00d711, and 100 is 2\u00b2\u00d75\u00b2. So altogether, 2\u00b2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77 \u00d711. So the LCM is 2\u00b2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77 \u00d711.\n\nThe LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So, if one number is 350 (2 \u00d75\u00b2 \u00d77), the other number must contribute the remaining factors. The LCM has 2\u00b2, so the other number must have 2^1 or 2^2? Let's see. The LCM's 2 is to the power of 2, so since one number has 2^1, the other must have at least 2^1 to get to 2^2? Or maybe the other has 2^2. Either way, the LCM's exponent is the max of the exponents from each number.\n\nSo, the other number could have 2^2. The LCM's 5 is 5^2, so the other number can have up to 5^2. The 7 is already in 350, so the other can have 7^0. The 11 must come from the other number because 350 doesn't have any 11. Since the GCF is 11, which is 11^1, so both numbers must have at least 11^1. But 350 doesn't have 11. Wait, that's the problem again.\n\nAh! Here's the problem. The GCF is 11, so both numbers must have 11 as a common factor. But 350 doesn't have 11 as a factor. Therefore, this is impossible. Which suggests that either the problem is wrong, or maybe I made a mistake in the question's numbers?\n\nWait, perhaps the question was stated correctly. Let me check again. The problem says the GCF is 11, LCM 7700, one number is 350. Hmm. Maybe there's a typo in the problem? Like maybe the GCF is 35 instead? Or the LCM is different?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct and I need to see where I'm wrong. Wait, perhaps I should think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula still holds, but the GCF is 11 even if one number isn't a multiple? No, that can't be. The GCF is the greatest common factor. So if one number isn't divisible by 11, then the GCF can't be 11. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem is wrong. But since it's an exam question, perhaps I made a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to re-express the numbers in terms of their GCF.\n\nAnother approach: Let me denote the two numbers as 11a and 11b, where a and b are coprime (since we've factored out the GCF). Then the LCM of the two numbers would be 11ab. Because LCM of 11a and 11b is 11 times LCM(a,b), and since a and b are coprime, LCM(a,b) is ab. So LCM is 11ab.\n\nGiven that the LCM is 7700, so 11ab =7700 \u2192 ab = 700.\n\nAlso, one of the numbers is 350, which is 11a or 11b. Let's see, 350 divided by 11 is 31.818..., which is not an integer, so that can't be. Wait, so that would mean that 350 must be equal to either 11a or 11b, but since it's not divisible by 11, that's impossible. So this suggests that the problem is impossible as stated. But that can't be. Maybe I made a mistake in this approach?\n\nWait, let me see again. The two numbers must be multiples of 11. Since their GCF is 11. So both numbers must be multiples of 11. But 350 isn't a multiple of 11. So the problem is contradictory. Therefore, perhaps the answer is none of the options, but that's not an option here. So there must be something wrong with my reasoning.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula when using the GCF and LCM. Let me confirm again. The formula says that for any two numbers, GCF(a,b) * LCM(a,b) = a*b. That's correct. So if the GCF is 11, LCM is 7700, then a*b = 11 *7700 = 84700. If one of the numbers is 350, then the other is 84700 /350 = 242. But then the GCF of 350 and 242 is 2, not 11. So that's a problem.\n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps the question has a typo. Like maybe the GCF is 2 instead of 11? But that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the other number is 350, but no, the question says one of them is 350. Wait, maybe I need to check the options again. Let's look at the options:\n\nA)242\n\nB)308\n\nC)352\n\nD)412\n\nE)456\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the GCF for 350 and 242. Let me check that again. Let me compute GCD(350,242).\n\n350 divided by 2 is 175, 242 divided by 2 is 121. So 2 is a common factor. Then GCD(175,121). 175 factors into 5\u00b2\u00d77. 121 is 11\u00b2. So they have no common factors except 1. So GCD is 2. So yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm. So the problem as stated has no solution because 350 is not a multiple of 11, making the GCF of 11 impossible. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is correct, and I need to see another way. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is correct, but I have a mistake in the prime factors. Let me check 350 again. 350 divided by 2 is 175. 175 divided by 5 is 35, divided by 5 again is 7. So yes, 2\u00d75\u00d75\u00d77. So no 11 there. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says the GCF is 11, but the LCM is 7700. Let me see if any of the options when paired with 350 give GCF 11 and LCM 7700.\n\nLet me try option B: 308.\n\nFirst, check GCF(350, 308). Let's see.\n\n350 factors: 2 \u00d75\u00b2\u00d77.\n\n308: 308 divided by 2 is 154, divided by 2 is 77. 77 is 7\u00d711. So factors are 2\u00b2 \u00d77\u00d711.\n\nSo common factors between 350 and 308:\n\nThe primes in common are 2 and 7.\n\nThe GCF would be the minimum exponents for each common prime.\n\nFor 2: min(1,2)=1 \u2192 2^1\n\nFor 7: min(1,1)=1 \u2192 7^1\n\nSo GCF is 2\u00d77=14. Not 11. So that's not the answer.\n\nOption C:352.\n\n352 divided by 2 is 176, divided by 2 is 88, divided by 2 is 44, divided by 2 is 22, divided by 2 is 11. So 352 is 2^6 \u00d711.\n\n350 is 2 \u00d75\u00b2\u00d77.\n\nCommon factors are 2^1. So GCF is 2. Not 11.\n\nOption D:412. Let's factor 412.\n\nDivide by 2: 206. Again by 2:103. 103 is a prime (since 103 divided by primes up to sqrt(103) ~10.1, so check 2,3,5,7. 103/3 is 34.3, etc. So 412 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7103.\n\n350's factors are 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. So common factor is 2. GCF is 2.\n\nOption E:456. Let's factor that.\n\n456 divided by 2 is 228, divided by 2 is 114, divided by 2 is 57. 57 is 3\u00d719. So 456 is 2\u00b3 \u00d73\u00d719.\n\n350's factors are 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factor is 2. GCF is 2.\n\nHmm, none of the options except A (242) have GCF with 350 as higher than 2. But 242 gives GCF 2, which doesn't match the problem's GCF of 11. So this is confusing.\n\nWait, but the problem says the GCF is 11, so perhaps I made a mistake in the options? Wait, let me check option B again. 308's factors include 11? Yes, 308 is 2\u00b2\u00d77\u00d711. So GCF with 350 would be 2\u00d77=14. Not 11. So not that.\n\nHmm. Wait, maybe the problem is correct, but I need to see what's going on here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct, and the answer is option B, but I made a mistake in the GCF calculation?\n\nWait, let's recalculate the GCF of 350 and 308 again.\n\n350: 2\u00d75\u00d75\u00d77\n\n308: 2\u00d72\u00d77\u00d711\n\nSo common primes: 2 and 7. The minimum exponents for 2 is 1 (since 350 has 2^1 and 308 has 2^2) \u2192 2^1.\n\nFor 7, both have 7^1. So GCF is 2\u00d77=14. So that's not 11. So that's not it.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to see if there's a different approach here.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is correct, so even if the GCF comes out to be different, but the problem states that the GCF is 11, so maybe the problem is wrong? But since this is a question from a test, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to see which of the options, when paired with 350, gives LCM of 7700 and GCF of 11. Let me check each option.\n\nTake option B:308.\n\nCompute GCF(350,308)=14, LCM(350,308). Let me compute LCM.\n\nThe LCM formula: (350\u00d7308)/GCF(350,308) = (350\u00d7308)/14.\n\n350 divided by 14 is 25. 25 \u00d7308 = 7700. So LCM is 7700. Oh! Wait a second! So even though the GCF is 14, the LCM is indeed 7700. But the problem says the GCF is 11, so this is not the answer. But the LCM matches here. Hmm, interesting.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the GCF is 11, so that's conflicting. So perhaps the correct answer is B, but the problem has a typo? Or maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, let's check option C:352.\n\nGCF(350,352). Let's compute.\n\n350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77, 352 is 2^6\u00d711. Common prime is 2. So GCF is 2. LCM would be (350\u00d7352)/2 = 350\u00d7176 = 61,600. Which is way higher than 7700. So not that.\n\nOption D:412. GCF(350,412)=2, LCM would be (350\u00d7412)/2 = 350\u00d7206= 72,100. Not 7700.\n\nOption E:456. GCF is 2. LCM is (350\u00d7456)/2 = 350\u00d7228 = 79,800. No.\n\nOption A:242. GCF 2, LCM is (350\u00d7242)/2 = 350\u00d7121 = 42,350. Not 7700. Wait, but earlier calculation said that 350\u00d7242 is 84,700? Wait, no. Wait, 350\u00d7242. Let me compute that again. 350\u00d7200 is 70,000, 350\u00d740 is 14,000, 350\u00d72 is 700. So total is 70,000+14,000=84,000 +700=84,700. Then divided by GCF (2) gives LCM of 42,350. But the problem says LCM is 7700, so that's not it.\n\nHmm. So the only option that gives LCM of 7700 is option B (308). But then its GCF is 14, which is different from the problem's 11. So that's conflicting.\n\nWait a second, perhaps the problem has swapped GCF and LCM? If the GCF was 14 and LCM 7700, then 308 would be the answer. But the problem says GCF is 11. Alternatively, maybe the given LCM is incorrect? Or perhaps the problem wants another approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, the formula is GCF(a,b) \u00d7 LCM(a,b) = a \u00d7 b. So in the case of option B (308 and 350):\n\nGCF(350,308) is 14, LCM is 7700. 14 \u00d77700 = 107,800. But 350\u00d7308 is 107,800. So that's correct. So the formula holds here, but the problem states GCF is 11, so that's not the case.\n\nHmm. So this is a problem. The options don't have any number which when paired with 350 gives GCF of 11. Because 350 isn't divisible by 11. Therefore, maybe the question has an error, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, maybe the question says that one of the integers is 350, but perhaps the other is a multiple of 11, and the GCF is 11 even if 350 isn't a multiple? That can't be. The GCF must divide both numbers. So if the GCF is 11, then 11 must divide both numbers. But 350 is not divisible by 11, so that's impossible. So the problem is impossible as stated.\n\nBut since it's a multiple choice question with options given, perhaps the answer is A (242) even though the GCF is wrong, but maybe I made a mistake in the GCF calculation?\n\nWait, let me check the GCF of 242 and 350 again. 242 is 2\u00d711\u00b2, 350 is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77. Common factors are 2. So GCF is 2. So that's correct.\n\nHmm. So this is perplexing. Maybe I made a mistake in reading the question. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says: The greatest common factor of two positive integers is 11. LCM is 7700. One of the integers is 350. What is the other?\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. If the GCF is 14, then the other number is 308 (option B), which would give LCM 7700. So that's possible. Maybe the GCF was supposed to be 14?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the LCM was supposed to be 42,350 for option A, but that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is correct and I need to see another approach. Let me try again.\n\nLet me suppose that the two numbers are 350 and x. GCF is 11, LCM is 7700.\n\nWe know that:\n\nGCF(350, x) = 11 \u21d2 11 divides both 350 and x. But 350 divided by 11 gives a non-integer, so this is impossible. Hence, there's no solution. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the formula holds?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct but there's a different approach. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me denote the two numbers as 11a and 11b where a and b are coprime (since we've factored out the GCF). Then, their LCM is 11ab. Since LCM is 7700, so 11ab =7700 \u21d2 ab=700.\n\nAlso, one of the numbers is 350. So either 11a=350 or 11b=350.\n\nLet me check 11a =350 \u2192 a=350/11 \u224831.818\u2026 which is not an integer. So that can't be. So the other case: 11b=350 \u2192 b=350/11, which is also not an integer. So neither case works. Hence, there is no solution. But the problem gives options, so this must mean that I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are not required to be multiples of the GCF? But that's impossible because the GCF divides both numbers.\n\nHmm. This is really confusing. Since the options are given and the problem is presented, perhaps I need to consider that maybe there's a mistake in the problem, but the closest possible answer is 242, even though the GCF is wrong, but maybe I made an error?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is correct, but I made a mistake in the calculation of LCM and GCF?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should recheck the LCM for 350 and 242. Let me see:\n\nThe LCM of 350 and 242.\n\nFactors of 350: 2 \u00d75\u00b2\u00d77.\n\nFactors of 242: 2 \u00d711\u00b2.\n\nThe LCM takes the highest exponents: 2^1 (since both have 2^1?), wait 242 has 2^1. 350 has 2^1. So LCM's 2^1. 5\u00b2, 7^1, and 11^2. So LCM is 2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d77\u00d711\u00b2. Let me compute that:\n\n2\u00d725 is 50, 50\u00d77=350, 350\u00d7121 (since 11\u00b2 is 121). 350\u00d7121. Let me compute that: 350\u00d7120 =42,000 plus 350\u00d71=350 \u2192 total 42,350. Which matches the previous calculation. So LCM is 42,350, but the problem states it's 7700. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm. So none of the options work. But since this is a multiple-choice question, there must be an answer. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula?\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is different when numbers are not co-prime? No, the formula holds for any two numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question has a different interpretation? Like maybe the numbers are in a different base? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant the greatest common divisor is 11 and least common multiple is 7700, and one number is 350. Then, the other number is 242. But the problem states GCF is 11, but that's not possible. But since the options are given, maybe the question had a mistake in the GCF and the answer is 242 (option A). Or perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated GCF of 242 and 350.\n\nLet me try using the Euclidean algorithm to find GCF(350,242).\n\nStep 1: 350 divided by 242 is 1 with remainder 108 (350-242=108).\n\nStep 2: 242 divided by 108 is 2 with remainder 26 (242-2\u00d7108 =26).\n\nStep 3: 108 divided by 26 is 4 with remainder 4 (108-4\u00d726=4).\n\nStep 4: 26 divided by 4 is 6 with remainder 2.\n\nStep 5: 4 divided by 2 is 2 with remainder 0.\n\nSo the GCF is 2. So that's correct. So that's not 11.\n\nHmm. So I'm stuck. The only possibility is that the question has an error. But since it's a test question, perhaps I need to choose the option that satisfies LCM=7700 even if GCF is different? But the question says the GCF is 11. So the correct answer must have GCF 11. But none of the options do.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula? Let me see again:\n\nThe formula is a\u00d7b = GCF(a,b) \u00d7 LCM(a,b). So given that, the other number would be (11\u00d77700)/350 = (84700)/350 = 242. But this gives the wrong GCF. So perhaps the question is correct, but the GCF is 11 and LCM 7700, but one number is 350. Then the other number is 242, but the GCF is actually 2. So this is conflicting. So perhaps the problem is wrong, but the answer is A?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct, but the numbers are allowed to have GCF 11 even if one isn't a multiple? But that's impossible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the GCF is 11, so the other number must be a multiple of 11, and 350 must also be a multiple of 11. But since it's not, perhaps the question intended one of the numbers to be 330 (which is 30\u00d711) instead of 350? Because 330 is a multiple of 11. Then, the other number would be (11\u00d77700)/330 = 11\u00d77700/330 = 11\u00d7(7700/330). 7700 divided by 330 is 23.333\u2026? Wait, 330\u00d723 is 7590, plus 110 is 7700. So 23 + (110/330) \u2192 23.333, so 7700/330 = 23.333\u2026 which is 70/3. So 11\u00d770/3 = 770/3 \u2248256.666, not an integer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if the number was 385 (which is 35\u00d711), then the other number would be (11\u00d77700)/385 = (84700)/385 = 220. Which is an integer. Then GCF of 385 and 220. 385 is 5\u00d77\u00d711. 220 is 2\u00b2\u00d75\u00d711. GCF is 5\u00d711=55. Not 11. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first number is 220 and second is 385? GCF(220,385)=55, LCM= 2\u00d72\u00d75\u00d77\u00d711 = 1540. Not 7700.\n\nHmm, this is going nowhere. I think the problem is faulty. But since the options are given, perhaps the intended answer is A (242), even though it doesn't satisfy the GCF condition. Or maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant that the GCF is 22? Let me check. If GCF is 22, then the other number would be (22\u00d77700)/350 = (169,400)/350 = 484. But 484 isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the GCF is 35? Let me see. Then the other number is (35\u00d77700)/350 = 7700/10 = 770. But that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different LCM. If LCM was 42,350, then the answer would be 242. But the LCM is given as 7700.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recheck:\n\nThe question says GCF is 11, LCM is 7700. One number is 350. So other number is (11\u00d77700)/350 = (11\u00d77700)/350. Let me compute that again:\n\n7700 divided by 350 is 22. So 11\u00d722 = 242. So that's correct. So the answer must be 242 (option A). Even though the GCF is 2 instead of 11. So perhaps the question has a mistake in the GCF value, but the answer is A. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the GCF calculation?\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think of the numbers 350 and 242.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is correct, but I'm missing that the GCF is 11, so maybe the numbers are 350 and 242, but their GCF is 11. But my calculation shows it's 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different definition of GCF? No, that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in a different base? Like base 10 vs base 12? That's unlikely.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck here. Since the formula gives 242 as the answer, and that's an option, perhaps the question intended that, and the GCF is a mistake. So the answer must be A. But the problem states the GCF is 11. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's numbers.\n\nWait, maybe the LCM is 7700 divided by 11? No, that's not right. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant to say that the greatest common factor is 2, but that's not the case. I think the problem is incorrect, but since the options are there, I have to choose the one that fits the formula, which is A)242. So I'll go with that.\n\n\nThe problem states that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two integers is 11, their least common multiple (LCM) is 7700, and one of the integers is 350. To find the other integer, we use the relationship between GCF and LCM: the product of the two numbers equals the product of their GCF and LCM. \n\nLet the two numbers be \\( x \\) and \\( y \\), where \\( x = 350 \\). Then:\n\n\\[\nx \\times y = \\text{GCF}(x, y) \\times \\text{LCM}(x, y)\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the known values:\n\n\\[\n350 \\times y = 11 \\times 7700\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( y \\):\n\n\\[\ny = \\frac{11 \\times 7700}{350} = \\frac{84700}{350} = 242\n\\]\n\nHowever, we must verify that the GCF of 350 and 242 is indeed 11. Factoring both numbers:\n\n- \\( 350 = 2 \\times 5^2 \\times 7 \\)\n- \\( 242 = 2 \\times 11^2 \\)\n\nThe common prime factor is 2, so the GCF is 2, not 11. This contradiction suggests an inconsistency in the problem's parameters. Despite this, the calculation using the formula yields 242, which is an option (A). Since the problem might contain an error but requires selecting from the given options, the answer derived via the formula is the only valid choice.\n\nAnswer: A",
