      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is to find the value of x given two equations: 6x minus y equals 24 and y equals 3x. Hmm, so substitution might be the way to go here since one of the equations already expresses y in terms of x. \n\nRight, so the first equation is 6x - y =24, and the second says y=3x. Since y is equal to 3x, I can substitute 3x in place of y in the first equation. That way, the first equation will only have x, and I can solve for it.\n\nLet me write that out. Substituting y with 3x in the first equation gives: 6x - (3x) =24. Wait, because the original equation is 6x minus y, so replacing y with 3x makes it 6x -3x. \n\nSimplifying that, 6x minus 3x is 3x. So 3x equals 24. Then to find x, I just divide both sides by 3. So x =24 divided by 3, which is 8. \n\nHmm, so x is 8? Let me check the options. Option A is 8. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the substitution step. \n\nOriginal equations:\n1) 6x - y =24\n2) y=3x\n\nSubstituting equation 2 into 1: 6x - (3x) =24. That's correct. 6x -3x is 3x. 3x =24 \u2192 x=8. \n\nWait, but let me see if plugging back the value into both equations works. Let me test x=8. Then y would be 3*8=24. \n\nPlugging into first equation: 6*8 is 48, minus y (24) equals 24. 48-24 is indeed 24. So that works. \n\nSo the answer should be A)8. But wait, the options given are A to E, with A being 8. So that's correct. Hmm, maybe I didn't make a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if there's another way to approach this problem. Like solving the system of equations using substitution or elimination. But since substitution worked straightforwardly, I think that's the right path. \n\nAnother way: Let's rearrange the second equation to express y in terms of x and substitute. Wait, that's exactly what I did. So I think the answer is A. But let me make sure I didn't misread the equations. The first equation is 6x minus y equals 24. The second is y equals 3x. Yep. So substitution gives 3x =24, so x is 8. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option A.\n",
