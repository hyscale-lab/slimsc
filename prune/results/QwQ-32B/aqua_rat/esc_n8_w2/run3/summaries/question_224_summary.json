      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about discounts on tubeless tyres. The manufacturer gives a 20% discount first, and then the retailer adds another 20% discount. I need to figure out the total discount. Hmm, discounts are percentages, so I have to be careful how they stack.\n\nWait, when you have two successive discounts, you can't just add them together. Like 20% +20% would be 40%, but that's not right because the second discount is applied after the first one. So the total discount would be less than 40%.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the original price is, let's pick a number to make it easier. Let's say the original price is $100. \n\nFirst discount from the manufacturer is 20%, so that reduces the price by 20. So 100 -20 =80. Now the price is $80. \n\nThen the retailer gives an additional 20% discount. Wait, 20% off of the already discounted price. So 20% of 80 is 16. So subtract that from 80 gives 64. \n\nSo the final price is $64. The total discount from the original $100 is 100-64=36. So that's a 36% discount? Wait but that's not one of the options. Wait the options are A to E, and E is 36%. Wait the options given here are A)10%, B)25%, C)28%, D)30%, E)36%. So E would be 36%? But wait, that seems like the answer. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me think in another way. The formula for total discount when two successive discounts are applied is: first discount is d1, second is d2. The total discount is d1 + d2 - (d1*d2)/100. Wait, is that the formula?\n\nAlternatively, the total discount can be calculated as 1 - (1 - d1)(1 - d2). So converting percentages to decimals.\n\nSo for 20% and 20%, that would be (0.2 and 0.2). So (1 - 0.2) is 0.8, times (1 -0.2) again is 0.8*0.8=0.64. So total price is 64% of original, which is a 36% discount. So that would be E)36%. \n\nHmm but the options include E as 36%, so that would be the correct answer. Wait but I thought sometimes when they say an additional discount, maybe it's applied differently. Like, maybe the second 20% is on the original price? But that would be 20+20=40, but that's not an option. So probably the correct way is the way I did first, leading to 36%.\n\nWait, but let me check again with another example. Suppose original price is $200. Manufacturer discount 20%: 200*0.8 =160. Then retailer 20% off: 160*0.8 =128. Total discount is 200-128=72. Which is 72/200 = 0.36 \u2192 36%. Yep, same result. So the answer must be E)36%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the total discount when two successive 20% discounts are applied, consider the original price as $100 for simplicity. \n\n1. **First discount (manufacturer's 20%):**  \n   The price after the first discount is \\( 100 - 20\\% \\times 100 = 80 \\).\n\n2. **Second discount (retailer's additional 20%):**  \n   The second discount is applied to the already reduced price of $80:  \n   \\( 20\\% \\times 80 = 16 \\).  \n   The final price after both discounts is \\( 80 - 16 = 64 \\).\n\n3. **Total discount calculation:**  \n   The total discount from the original price is \\( 100 - 64 = 36 \\), which represents a **36% discount**.\n\nUsing the formula for successive discounts:  \nTotal discount = \\( 1 - (1 - d_1)(1 - d_2) \\), where \\( d_1 = 0.2 \\) and \\( d_2 = 0.2 \\):  \n\\( 1 - (0.8 \\times 0.8) = 1 - 0.64 = 0.36 \\), or **36%**.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **E)36%**.\n\nAnswer: E",

Let me recalculate. \n\nOriginal price P. After first discount (20%), it's P*(1 - 0.20) = 0.80P. Then another 20% off on that, so the final price is 0.80P * (1 - 0.20) = 0.80 * 0.80 * P = 0.64P.

So the total discount is 20% plus 20% of the remaining? So the total discount is not additive but multiplicative. So yes, the calculation as I did before is correct, leading to 36%.\n\nHmm, but I remember some similar problems where the combined discount is not 36% but something else. Wait, like if you have two successive discounts of 20% and 20%, the equivalent single discount is 36%, which would be E here.
