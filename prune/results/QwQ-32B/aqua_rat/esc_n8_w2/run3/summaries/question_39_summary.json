      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out the monthly sales needed for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. Hmm. So her salary has two parts: a fixed part and a percentage of sales. The fixed is $500, right? And then 5% of the sales. So the total salary S is 500 plus 5% of sales.\n\nThe question is asking, when does S equal $1500? So I need to set up an equation here. Let me write that out. Let me call the monthly sales 'x'. Then the equation would be:\n\nS = 500 + 0.05 * x\n\nWe want S to be 1500. So plugging that in:\n\n1500 = 500 + 0.05x\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Subtract 500 from both sides first. \n\n1500 - 500 = 0.05x  \nSo that's 1000 = 0.05x\n\nHmm, right. Then to get x, divide both sides by 0.05. Let me calculate that. \n\n1000 divided by 0.05. Wait, 0.05 is the same as 5%, so dividing by 0.05 is like multiplying by 20. Because 1/0.05 is 20. So 1000 * 20 is 20,000. \n\nWait, but hold on, if x is 20,000, then 5% of that is 1000. Adding to 500 gives 1500. Oh right, that works. So then the sales needed are $20,000. Looking at the options, D is $20,000. So the answer should be D?\n\nWait, but let me double-check my math. Let me redo the calculation. \n\n1000 divided by 0.05. Let's see: 0.05 times x equals 1000. \n\nSo 0.05 * x = 1000  \nx = 1000 / 0.05  \nDividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by (1 / 0.05) which is 20. So yes, 1000 * 20 is 20,000. \n\nHmm, so that's correct. So the answer is D. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)50k, B)40k, C)30k, D)20k, E) none. So D is 20k, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer is D. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me read the question again. The salary is fixed $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. So yeah, the equation is right. So when sales are 20k, 5% is 1k, plus 500 gives 1500. Yep. So D is correct. The options don't have any other, so the answer is D.\n",

The problem says her salary S is a fixed $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. Hmm, right. So the equation would be S = 500 + 0.05*(sales). \n\nThe question is asking, what should the sales be so that S is $1500. So I need to set up the equation and solve for sales. Let me write that down.\n\nStarting with the equation: 1500 = 500 + 0.05x, where x is the monthly sales. To solve for x, first subtract 500 from both sides. That gives 1500 - 500 = 0.05x. 1500 minus 500 is 1000, so 1000 = 0.05x. \n\nNow, to find x, I need to divide both sides by 0.05. Let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 0.05.

If sales are 20,000, then 5% of that is 0.05*20,000 = 1,000. Adding the fixed 500 gives 1,500. Yep, that's exactly the target salary. So the answer should be D?\n\nWait a second, hold on.

But why is the option E there? Maybe I made a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me read again. The problem states that the salary is the sum of fixed $500 plus 5% of sales.
