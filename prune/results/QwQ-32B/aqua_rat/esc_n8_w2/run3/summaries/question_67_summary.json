      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about figuring out how many grams of this health food someone needs to eat daily to get at least the minimum daily requirements for both vitamins E and A. Hmm, right. The problem states that one gram gives 9% of the daily E and 8% of the daily A. \n\nWait, so the person needs to get enough of both vitamins, but each gram contributes a bit to both. But maybe the amounts needed for each vitamin are different? Because if you take more grams, you get more of each. But the problem is, the percentages for E and A per gram are different. So I need to find the smallest number of grams that will make both the E and A percentages add up to at least 100%, right?\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of grams as x. Then, the total vitamin E would be 9% times x, and the total vitamin A would be 8% times x. Wait, but both have to be at least 100% of their respective requirements. So the equations would be:\n\n0.09x \u2265 1 (for vitamin E)\n0.08x \u2265 1 (for vitamin A)\n\nBecause 1 is 100% of the requirement. So solving both inequalities will give me the x that satisfies both. \n\nLet me solve each inequality separately. \n\nFirst, for vitamin E:\n0.09x \u2265 1 \u2192 x \u2265 1 / 0.09. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 0.09 is the same as 100/9, which is approximately 11.111... grams.\n\nFor vitamin A:\n0.08x \u2265 1 \u2192 x \u2265 1 / 0.08 = 12.5. Because 1 divided by 0.08 is 12.5 exactly.\n\nHmm, so to satisfy both, the person has to eat enough grams so that both conditions are met. The vitamin E requires at least ~11.11 grams, and vitamin A requires 12.5 grams. So the higher of the two is 12.5 grams. Because if you take 12.5 grams, then for E, 12.5 * 0.09 = 1.125 (which is 112.5% of E's requirement) and for A, exactly 100%. So that works. \n\nLooking at the options, 12.5 is option C. So the answer should be C. Let me check the options again. The options are A)8.5, B)10.5, C)12.5, D)14.5, E)16.5. Yep, so 12.5 is there as option C. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the percentages. Let me re-calculate. \n\nFor E: 1/0.09 is indeed approximately 11.11, so 11.11 grams would give exactly 100% E. But since you can't eat a fraction of a gram, but the problem doesn't specify that it has to be whole grams. The question just says \"how many grams must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum\". So fractions are okay here. \n\nSo the minimum x that satisfies both is the maximum of the two required amounts. Since 12.5 is higher than 11.11, that's the right answer. Therefore, the correct choice is C.\n",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe question says that one gram of the health food gives 9% of the daily requirement for vitamin E and 8% for vitamin A. We need to find out how many grams someone must eat daily to get at least the minimum for both vitamins. And the options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm. Let me think. Let's denote the number of grams needed as x. \n\nFor vitamin E: Each gram gives 9%, so x grams would give 9% * x. We need this to be at least 100% (the minimum daily requirement). So the equation would be 9x \u2265 100.\n\nSimilarly, for vitamin A: Each gram gives 8%, so 8% * x must be \u2265 100. So 8x \u2265 100.\n\nWait, right. So we have two inequalities here. The person needs to satisfy both conditions. So x has to be such that both 9x \u2265 100 and 8x \u2265 100.\n\nSo solving each inequality:\n\nFor E: 9x \u2265 100 \u2192 x \u2265 100/9. Let me calculate that. 100 divided by 9 is approximately 11.11 grams.\n\nFor A: 8x \u2265 100 \u2192 x \u2265 100/8 = 12.5 grams.\n\nOh wait, so the E requires about 11.11 grams, and A requires 12.5 grams. Since you can't eat a fraction of a gram below the required, but the question says \"at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.\" So to satisfy both, you need to take the larger of the two values, right? Because if you take 12.5 grams, then for E, 12.5 *9 = 112.5%, which is over the required, but that's okay. But for A, 12.5 *8 = 100%, which is exactly the requirement. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, if you took 11.11 grams, then for E that's enough, but for A, 11.11 *8 is 88.88%, which is not enough. So you have to choose the higher value between the two required minimums. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 12.5 grams, which is option C. Let me check the options again. The options are A)8.5, B)10.5, C)12.5, D)14.5, E)16.5. Yep, C is 12.5. That makes sense. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm the math again. For vitamin E, 100 divided by 9 is indeed approximately 11.11, so 11.11 grams would give exactly 100% for E, but for A, 11.11 *8 = 88.88, which is under. So to get A up to 100%, you need 12.5. Since the question requires that both are at least the minimum, you have to take the larger number. So yes, C is the correct answer. The other options: like B is 10.5, which would give E as 9*10.5=94.5%, which is under for E. So not enough. So C is the smallest number that meets both requirements. \n\nI think that's right. Let me just make sure there's no trick here. The question says \"how many grams must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins\". So the answer must satisfy both, so taking the maximum of the two required amounts. Yep, so the answer is C.\n",
