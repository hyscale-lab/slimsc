      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the wage on the 8th day. Hmm. The average wage over 15 days is $90 per day. So first, I need to find the total wages for those 15 days. Since average is total divided by number of days, total would be 15 times 90. Let me calculate that. 15 times 90 is 1350. Right.\n\nNow, during the first 7 days, the average was $87. So the total for the first 7 days is 7 times 87. Let me do that: 7*87. Let's see, 7*80 is 560, plus 7*7 is 49, so total 609. \n\nThen the last 7 days had an average of $92. So that's 7 times 92. 7*90 is 630, plus 7*2 is 14, so total 644. \n\nWait, but the 15 days are consecutive, so the 8th day is the overlapping day between the first 7 and the last 7? Because the first 7 days are days 1-7, and the last 7 days would be days 9-15? Wait, no, maybe I need to think again. Wait, the 15 days are consecutive. The first seven days are days 1-7, then the next days are 8-15. But the problem says the last seven days. So the last seven days would be days 9 through 15? Wait, 15 days total. So the last seven days would be days 9 to 15? Wait, that's 7 days (9-15 is 7 days?), yes. But then the 8th day is day 8. So the first 7 days plus the last 7 days would cover all days except day 8? Because days 1-7 plus days 9-15. So the total of those 14 days is 609 + 644. Let me add those: 609 + 644. 600+600 is 1200, 9+44 is 53, so total 1253. \n\nBut the total for all 15 days is 1350. So the difference between 1350 and 1253 should be the wage on the 8th day. Let me subtract: 1350 minus 1253. Hmm, 1350 - 1250 is 100, so minus 3 more gives 97. Wait, so that would be 97? So the answer would be D) $97? \n\nWait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nTotal for 15 days: 15\u00d790=1350. Correct. \n\nFirst 7 days total: 7\u00d787=609. Correct. \n\nLast 7 days (days 9-15): 7\u00d792=644. Correct. \n\nTotal of first and last 7 days: 609+644=1253. \n\n1350 - 1253 = 97. So yes, that's the 8th day's wage. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be D. Let me check the options again. Option D is 97. So that must be correct. I think that's it.\n",

Let me do that: 7 times 80 is 560, plus 7*7 is 49, so 560+49=609. Wait, no, wait 87*7. Let me recalculate that. 87*7: 80*7=560, 7*7=49, so 560+49=609. Yeah that's right. So first 7 days total is $609.\n\nThen the last 7 days had an average of $92. So that's 7*92. Let's see: 90*7 is 630, plus 2*7=14, so 630+14=644. So the last seven days total is $644.\n\nWait, but the 15 days include the 8th day. Wait a second, the first 7 days plus the last 7 days would be 14 days, but the total is 15 days. So the 8th day is the middle day that's being counted in both? No, wait. The problem says \"the first 7 days\" and \"the last 7 days\" of the 15-day period. So the 8th day is the 8th day, which is not included in either the first 7 or the last 7? Wait, no, let me think. Let's see, the 15 days are consecutive. The first seven days are days 1-7, the last seven days would be days 9-15? Wait, no. Wait, the last seven days of the 15 would be days 9 to 15? Wait no, 15 days total. Let's see, the last seven days would be days 9 to 15? Wait 15 days. Let me count: 1-7 (first 7), then days 8 is the 8th day, and then the last 7 days would be days 9-15? Wait, no, that's only 7 days. Wait, 15 days: days 1 to 15. The first seven days (1-7), the last seven days (9-15) would be 7 days, but that leaves day 8 as the 8th day, which is the middle day. So the total of first seven plus last seven plus day 8 equals 15 days? Wait no, first seven plus last seven would be 14 days, plus day 8 would be 15? Wait, no, first seven (7 days) plus the last seven (days 9 to 15, which is 7 days) plus day 8? Wait, no. Wait, the last seven days of the 15-day period would be days 9 through 15? Wait, 15 days: the last seven days would be days 9 to 15? Let me count: 15-7+1 = 9. So days 9 to 15 are 7 days. So days 1-7 (7 days), days 9-15 (7 days), and day 8 is in the middle. So the total of first seven and last seven is 14 days, and the 15th day is day 8. Wait no, day 8 is the 8th day. So the total of first seven (days 1-7) plus the last seven (days 9-15) is 14 days, leaving out day 8. Wait, that's right. So the total of those two periods (first 7 and last 7) is 14 days, so the remaining day is the 8th day, which is the middle day. \n\nSo the total wages for the first 7 days plus last 7 days is 609 + 644 = 1253. Then, the total for the entire 15 days is 1350. So the difference between 1350 and 1253 would be the wage on the 8th day. Let me compute that: 1350 minus 1253. Let's see, 1350 - 1250 = 100, then subtract 3 more gives 97. Wait, 1253 plus 97 equals 1350? Let me check: 1253 + 97 = 1350. Yes, because 1253 + 97 is 1253 + (100-3) = 1353 -3 = 1350. Right. So the wage on the 8th day must be $97. Looking at the options, D is $97. So the answer should be D. Wait, let me check again to be sure. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the average wage during the last 7 days was $92\". The last seven days of the 15-day period, so days 9-15. The first seven days are days 1-7, and the 8th day is day 8. So yes, the total of the first seven and last seven days is 609 + 644 = 1253. The total of all 15 days is 15*90=1350. So the 8th day's wage is 1350-1253 = 97. That's D. So the correct answer is D.\n",

Wait, 15 days: the last seven days would be days 9 to 15? Let me count: 15-7+1 = 9. So days 9 to 15 are 7 days. So days 1-7 (7 days), days 9-15 (7 days), and day 8 is in the middle. So the total of first seven and last seven is 14 days, and the 15th day is day 8. Wait no, day 8 is the 8th day.

Let's see, 1350 - 1250 = 100, then subtract 3 more gives 97. Wait, 1253 plus 97 equals 1350? Let me check: 1253 + 97 = 1350. Yes, because 1253 + 97 is 1253 + (100-3) = 1353 -3 = 1350. Right. So the wage on the 8th day must be $97. Looking at the options, D is $97. So the answer should be D. Wait, let me check again to be sure. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the average wage during the last 7 days was $92\". The last seven days of the 15-day period, so days 9-15. The first seven days are days 1-7, and the 8th day is day 8. So yes, the total of the first seven and last seven days is 609 + 644 = 1253. The total of all 15 days is 15*90=1350.
