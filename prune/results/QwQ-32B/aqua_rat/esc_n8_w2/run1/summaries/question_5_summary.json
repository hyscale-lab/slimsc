      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about finding the cost price of an article when it's sold at a 20% profit for 360 rupees. Hmm, let me think. Alright, profit percentage calculations. I remember that when something is sold at a profit, the selling price is the cost price plus the profit. The formula, I think, is Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit. And the profit here is 20% of the cost price. \n\nWait, right. The profit percentage is calculated based on the cost price. So, the formula should be Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + (Profit % * CP). Or maybe written as SP = CP \u00d7 (1 + profit%). Because 20% profit would mean the selling price is 120% of the cost price. \n\nLet me confirm that. If the cost price is, say, 100, then 20% profit would make the selling price 120. So yes, SP = CP multiplied by (1 + 20/100). So in this case, the selling price is given as 360. So 360 equals CP multiplied by 1.2. To find CP, I need to divide 360 by 1.2. \n\nLet me do the calculation. 360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 1.2 times 300 is 360, because 1.2 times 300: 300 * 1 = 300, 300 * 0.2 is 60, so total 360. Oh wait, that would mean the cost price is 300. So the answer should be B) 300. \n\nWait, let me check again. Let's plug back in. If CP is 300, then 20% of 300 is 60. Adding that gives 360, which matches the SP given. So that seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can set up the equation step by step. Let's see:\n\nLet the cost price be x. The profit is 20%, so the selling price is x plus 20% of x. \n\nSo SP = x + 0.2x = 1.2x. \n\nGiven that SP is 360, so 1.2x = 360 \u2192 x = 360 / 1.2. \n\n360 divided by 1.2. Let me compute this again. 1.2 times 300 is 360, so yes, x is 300. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 300. So the answer must be B. \n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was remembering that the profit is on the cost price. So the calculation seems straightforward. Let me check the options again. The options are A)270, B)300, C)280, D)320, E)315. Yep, B is there. Alright, confident that's the right choice.\n",
