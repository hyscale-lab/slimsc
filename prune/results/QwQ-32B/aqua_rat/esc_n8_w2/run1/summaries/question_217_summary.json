      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this probability problem. Hmm, the question is about Mr. Jain selecting two horses out of five in a race and wanting to know the probability that he picked the winning horse. Alright, so first I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. The key point is that there's one winning horse among the five, right? And he's choosing two horses at random. We need to find the probability that at least one of the two he picked is the winner.\n\nWait, but maybe I should think of it in terms of combinations. Let me see. The total number of ways to choose any two horses out of five is combination of 5 taken 2 at a time. The formula for combinations is n choose k is n!/(k!(n-k)!), so here that would be 5C2. Let me compute that. 5*4/(2*1) = 10. So total possible pairs are 10.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are the number of pairs that include the winning horse. Let's say the winning horse is called Horse A. How many pairs include Horse A? Well, if he must be in the pair, then the other horse can be any of the remaining four. So for each winning horse, the number of pairs that include it is 4. Wait, but since there's only one winning horse, right? The problem states \"the winning horse\"\u2014so there's exactly one winner here. So the number of favorable pairs is 4 (since the other horse can be any of the other four). \n\nTherefore, the probability would be the favorable over total, so 4/10. Which simplifies to 2/5. Wait, but hold on\u2014is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it another way. The probability that he selected the winning horse is the same as 1 minus the probability that he didn't select the winning horse. Let's see. The total number of ways to choose two horses not including the winner: there are 4 non-winning horses, so 4 choose 2. That's 6. So the probability of not picking the winner is 6/10, so 1 - 6/10 is 4/10, which is 2/5. So that's the same answer as before. So the answer should be B) 2/5?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me think again. Let's suppose the winning horse is Horse 1. The possible pairs that include Horse 1 are (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (1,5). That's 4 pairs. The total number of possible pairs is 10. So 4/10 is indeed 2/5, so B. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that the probability is 2/5 because he picks two horses, so each has a 1/5 chance, so adding them gives 2/5. But that's actually correct here because the events are mutually exclusive? Wait, no, the probability of either of the two being the winner would be the probability that the first is the winner plus the probability the second is the winner minus the probability that both are the winner. But since there's only one winner, the probability that both are the winner is zero. So the total probability is 1/5 +1/5 = 2/5. Oh right, that's another way to see it. \n\nSo yes, that's the same answer. So the correct answer is B) 2/5. The options have B as 2/5, so that must be the right choice. I don't see any flaws in these approaches. Let me check the options again. The options given are A)1/5, B)2/5, C)3/5, D)4/5, E)6/5. Yep, so B is the correct one. Alright, confident now.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse when he randomly chooses two out of five horses, we start by calculating the total number of possible pairs. The number of ways to choose 2 horses from 5 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = 10 \\).\n\nNext, we consider the favorable outcomes where the winning horse is among the selected pair. Since there is only one winning horse, the other horse in the pair must be one of the remaining 4 non-winning horses. The number of such pairs is \\( \\binom{4}{1} = 4 \\).\n\nThus, the probability of selecting the winning horse is the ratio of favorable outcomes to total outcomes: \\( \\frac{4}{10} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\nAn alternative approach confirms this result. The probability of not selecting the winning horse is calculated by choosing 2 horses from the 4 non-winning ones, which is \\( \\binom{4}{2} = 6 \\). The probability of not selecting the winner is \\( \\frac{6}{10} = \\frac{3}{5} \\). Subtracting this from 1 gives \\( 1 - \\frac{3}{5} = \\frac{2}{5} \\).\n\nBoth methods yield the same result, confirming the correct answer is **B) 2/5**.\n\nAnswer: B",

Mr. Jain selects two at random and bets on them. What's the probability that he selected the winning horse? The options are A to E, with B being 2/5 and C 3/5 and so on.\n\nHmm. Let me think. So, the key here is that there's one winning horse, right? And he picks two. We need to find the probability that the winning horse is among the two he chose. \n\nWait, right. So the total number of possible ways he can choose two horses out of five is combination 5 choose 2. Let me recall the formula for combinations. That's 5!/(2!*(5-2)!)) which is (5*4)/(2*1) = 10. So there are 10 possible pairs.\n\nNow, the favorable outcomes are the number of pairs that include the winning horse. Let's say the winning horse is Horse A. How many pairs include Horse A? Well, he can pair Horse A with any of the other four horses. So that's 4 possible pairs (A and B, A and C, etc.). So 4 favorable outcomes.\n\nTherefore, the probability is 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5. Wait, that would be option B. But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach: the probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. Then, the probability that the second horse is the winner would be 1/4 (if the first wasn't the winner). Wait, no, maybe that's complicating it.\n\nAlternatively, think of it as the probability that either the first or the second horse is the winner. Since he picks two, the chance that the winner is in either of the two selected. Alternatively, the probability that the first horse is the winner plus the probability that the second is the winner but not the first. Wait, maybe that's overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the probability that he didn't pick the winner is the complement. So, the number of ways to pick two horses that don't include the winner. There are 4 other horses, so 4 choose 2 is 6. So the probability of not having the winner is 6/10, which is 3/5. Therefore, the probability of having the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. So that's the same as before. So answer B?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me confirm once again. Let's see: total combinations 10. The number of pairs with the winning horse is 4. So 4/10 is 2/5. Yes. So the correct answer should be B) 2/5.\n\nBut wait, another way: each horse has an equal chance of being selected. Since he picks two out of five, the probability that any particular horse (the winner) is among the two is 2/5. Oh right, that's a simpler way to see it. Because each horse has an equal chance of being selected, and he's selecting two, so the probability that the winning horse is selected is 2/5. So that also gives B.\n\nHmm, so all approaches lead to 2/5. So the answer must be B.\n",
