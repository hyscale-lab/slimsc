      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the perimeter of a rectangle. Let me think. The question says the rectangle has a length of 8 centimeters and a width of 3 centimeters. Alright, perimeter is the total distance around the rectangle, right? I remember that the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is something like twice the sum of its length and width. Wait, let me make sure.\n\nHmm, the formula for perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times (length plus width). So, P = 2*(l + w). Let me confirm that. Because a rectangle has two lengths and two widths. So adding length and width gives one of each, and multiplying by two accounts for both pairs. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo plugging in the numbers here. The length is 8 cm and the width is 3 cm. Let me add those first. 8 plus 3 is 11. Then multiply that by 2. 11 times 2 is 22. Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)18, B)22, C)20, D)30, E)28. So 22 would be option B. Hmm.\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the formula? Let me think again. Alternatively, sometimes people might calculate it as 2 times length plus 2 times width. Let me try that way. 2*8 is 16, and 2*3 is 6. Adding those together gives 16 +6 =22. Same result. So that's still B. \n\nHmm, but why is option C 20? Maybe someone could miscalculate 8+3 as 10? Like adding wrong? But no, 8+3 is definitely 11. Wait, perhaps I misread the numbers? Let me check again. Length 8 cm, width 3 cm. Yep, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Like, maybe it's not a rectangle but a square? No, the problem clearly states rectangle with given length and width. So no. \n\nAnother way to check: the perimeter is all the sides added. So 8 + 3 + 8 +3. That's 8+8 is 16, 3+3 is 6, total 22. Yep. So that's the same answer again. So the correct answer should be B)22cm. \n\nLooking at the options again, B is 22. So I think that's the right choice. I don't see any errors in my calculations here. So the answer must be B.\n",
