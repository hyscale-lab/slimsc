      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where there's a rectangular wire with a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm. Then they bend it into a square, and I need to find the length of each side of that square. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you bend a wire into different shapes, the total length of the wire remains the same. So the perimeter of the rectangle must be equal to the perimeter of the square formed from it. That makes sense because the wire's length isn't changing, just its shape.\n\nAlright, so I need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle first. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times length plus breadth, right? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is 2*(length + breadth). Oh right, that's correct. So let me plug in the numbers here. The length is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm. \n\nCalculating that: 2*(27 +17). Let's do the addition first inside the parentheses. 27 plus 17 is... 27+10 is 37, plus 7 more is 44. So 2*44 equals 88. So the perimeter of the rectangle is 88 cm. \n\nNow, since the wire is rebent into a square, the perimeter of the square must also be 88 cm. The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. Let me denote the side of the square as 's'. So, 4*s = 88. To find s, I just divide both sides by 4. \n\n88 divided by 4... Let me do that calculation. 4 times 20 is 80, so 88 minus 80 is 8. So that's 20 + 2 (since 4*2 is 8) so total 22. Wait, 4*22 is 88. Oh right, so each side should be 22 cm. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 22. So the answer must be C. Let me double-check my steps. The perimeter of the rectangle: 2*(27+17)=2*44=88. Square's perimeter is 4*s=88, so s=22. Yep, that's right. I don't see any mistakes here. The options given include 22 as option C. So I think that's the correct choice.\n",

So first, the key here must be that the total length of the wire remains the same when it's reshaped. That makes sense because you're just bending it, not cutting or adding any wire.\n\nSo the original shape is a rectangle with length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm.
