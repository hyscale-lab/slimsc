      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this math problem here. Let me look at the question again. It's [(272 - 32) multiplied by (124 + 176)] divided by (17 times 15 minus 15). The options are A to E. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll tackle the numerator part, which is (272 - 32) multiplied by (124 + 176). Let me compute each part separately. \n\nStarting with 272 minus 32. That should be straightforward. 272 minus 30 is 242, then subtract 2 more, so 240. Wait, no, 272 -32. Let me do it properly. 272 minus 30 is 242, then minus 2 more is 240. Yeah, that's right. So that part is 240.\n\nNext, the other part of the numerator is 124 plus 176. Let me add those. 124 + 176. Hmm, 124 + 170 is 294, then plus 6 more would be 300. Wait, 124+176: 100+100 is 200, 24+76 is 100, so total 300. Yep, that adds up to 300. \n\nSo now the numerator is 240 multiplied by 300. Let me calculate that. 240 times 300. Well, 24 times 3 is 72, and then adding four zeros (since 240 is 24*10 and 300 is 3*100, so total 10*100 is 1000). So 24*3=72, so 72,000. Wait, 240 * 300 = 72,000. That's the numerator.\n\nNow the denominator is (17\u00d715 - 15). Let me compute that. First, 17 multiplied by 15. Hmm, 17*15. Let's see, 10*15 is 150, 7*15 is 105, so 150+105=255. So 17\u00d715 is 255. Then subtract 15 from that. 255 minus 15 is 240. Oh, so the denominator is 240.\n\nSo putting it all together, the entire expression is 72,000 divided by 240. Let me compute that. Hmm, 72,000 divided by 240. Maybe simplify the numbers. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 10 first, so that becomes 7,200 / 24. \n\nNow, 7200 divided by 24. Let me think. 24 times 300 is 7,200. Because 24*300 = 24*(3*100) = 72*100 = 7200. Oh right! So 7200 divided by 24 is exactly 300. So the result is 300. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 300. So the answer should be C. Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst part: 272-32 is 240. Correct. 124+176 is 300. Correct. Multiply those gives 240*300=72,000. That's right. \n\nDenominator: 17\u00d715 is 255. Subtract 15 gives 240. Correct. So 72000 divided by 240 is indeed 300. So the answer is C. \n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)0, B)2.25, C)300, D)400, E)None. So 300 is option C. So the answer must be C. Hmm. Unless I made a calculation mistake somewhere. Let me check again.\n\nWait, 17 multiplied by 15. Let me re-calculate. 17*10 is 170, 17*5 is 85, so 170+85 is 255. Yes. Then subtract 15 gives 240. That's correct. \n\nAnother way: The denominator can be factored. 17\u00d715 -15 = 15*(17-1) = 15\u00d716. Wait, wait! Wait a second, hold on. Wait, 17\u00d715 -15. That's 15*(17-1) because factor out 15. So 15*(16) which is 240. Oh right, same result. So that's correct. \n\nSo denominator is 15\u00d716 = 240. So yeah, same as before. So 72000 /240 = 300. So answer is C. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is C)300. I don't see any errors here. So the answer must be C.\n",
