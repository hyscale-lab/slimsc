      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about calculating the percentage gain for a merchant who bought oranges and sold them. Hmm, percentage gain... I remember that's usually calculated by taking the profit divided by the cost price, then multiplying by 100 to get a percentage. Right.\n\nFirst, I need to find out the total cost price and the total selling price. The merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. So the cost price per kg would be 450 divided by 90, but maybe I don't need that. Wait, the total cost is already given as 450. When he sells the whole lot at Rs.7.50 per kg, the total selling price would be 90 kg multiplied by 7.50. Let me calculate that.\n\nSo total selling price is 90 * 7.50. Let's do that math. 90 times 7 is 630, and 90 times 0.5 is 45, so adding those gives 630 +45 = 675. So the total SP is 675 rupees. \n\nThe cost price was 450. So the profit is SP minus CP, which is 675 -450 = 225. \n\nNow, percentage gain is (Profit / CP) * 100. So 225 divided by 450. Let me compute that. 225 divided by 450 equals 0.5. Multiply by 100 gives 50%. Wait, that would be option A. But hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait the options include 50% as A. But let me confirm the calculations once more. \n\nTotal cost price is 450. Selling price total is 90 *7.50. Let me recalculate that. 90 multiplied by 7.5. Alternatively, 7.5 times 90: 7.5 * 90. 7 *90 is 630, 0.5 *90 is 45. So total 675. Correct. \n\nProfit is 675-450 = 225. Then 225 /450 is indeed 0.5, so 50%. So the answer should be A)50%. But wait, the options given include A as 50%, which would be correct. Hmm, but wait the options given here are A to E. Let me check the options again as per the question. The options listed are A)50%, B)60%, C)55%, D)70%, E)58%. So yes, A is an option. So why am I confused?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the selling price. Let me confirm again. 90 kg sold at 7.5 per kg. 7.5 *90. Let me do 7.5 * 100 would be 750, so minus 7.5*10 (75) gives 750-75=675. Correct. So yes, SP is 675. CP 450. Profit 225. 225/450 is 50%. So answer is A. \n\nBut wait, maybe the question is a trick question? Like, is there any other costs involved? The problem states he purchased for 450 and sold the whole lot at 7.5 per kg. So no, the calculation seems straightforward. So the answer must be A. So the correct option is A)50%.\n",
