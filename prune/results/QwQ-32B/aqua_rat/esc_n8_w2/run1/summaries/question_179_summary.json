      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around a rectangular plot. The perimeter of the plot is given as 340 meters, and the cost is 10 per square meter. Hmm, so I need to find the area of that boundary first and then multiply by 10 to get the cost.\n\nWait, the key here is to figure out the area of the garden strip. Since it's a rectangle with a 1m wide path around it, the area would be the area of the larger rectangle (the original plus the path) minus the area of the original plot. But wait, but to do that, I need the dimensions of the original plot. Wait, the problem only gives the perimeter. Hmm, but the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth). So perimeter is 340, so length + breadth = 170. But without knowing the individual length and breadth, can I find the area of the path?\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the original plot's length as L and breadth as B. So 2(L + B) = 340 \u2192 L + B = 170. The area of the plot is L*B. The garden path is 1m wide around it, so the total area including the path would be (L + 2)*(B + 2). Because adding 1m on each side, so both length and breadth increase by 2 meters. So the area of the path is (L+2)(B+2) - L*B. Let's compute that:\n\n(L+2)(B+2) = LB + 2L + 2B +4. Subtract LB, so the path area is 2L + 2B +4. Which simplifies to 2(L+B) +4. Since L+B is 170, then 2*170 is 340, plus 4 gives 344. So the area is 344 square meters. Then the cost is 344 *10 = 3440. So the answer would be option C)3440. But wait, let me check again because sometimes I might make a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the path is only around the boundary, so perhaps the path is 1 meter broad on all sides. So the area would be the area between the outer rectangle (the plot plus path) and the original plot. The outer rectangle's length is L + 2 (1m on each side), same with breadth. So yes, that's what I did before. The calculation seems right. So 2(L+B) +4 is 2*170 +4 = 344. Multiply by 10 gives 3440, which is option C. But let me check the options again. The options are A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D) cannot be determined, E) none. So C is there, so that's the answer. Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, is there another way to approach this? Suppose the perimeter is 340, so L+B=170. The area of the path is (L+2)(B+2) - LB = 2(L+B) +4. Since L+B is known, then yes, the area is 2*170 +4 = 344. So that's correct. So the answer is C. So the correct option is C. But wait, sometimes people might think the path is only on one side, but the question says \"boundary around\", so it's on all sides, so the 1m is added to both ends. So I think the calculation is correct. Therefore the answer is C, 3440. So option C is the right choice.\n",

Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem is about finding the area of the boundary (which I think is like a path around the rectangle) and then multiplying by the rate to get the cost. But wait, how do I find the area of just that boundary?\n\nThe plot is rectangular. Let me recall that the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). The perimeter here is 340 meters. But to find the area of the boundary, I might need the actual length and width of the plot. Wait, but the problem doesn't give the length or width directly, just the perimeter. That could be a problem because there are infinitely many rectangles with the same perimeter but different areas. \n\nHmm, so the question is asking for the cost, which depends on the area of the boundary. Let me visualize this: imagine the garden is a rectangle, and around it, there's a 1m wide path. The area to be gardened is the area of this path. \n\nTo find the area of the path, I think you subtract the area of the inner rectangle (the original plot) from the area of the outer rectangle (the plot plus the path). But wait, actually, the path is around the plot, so the outer rectangle would be larger. But how much larger?\n\nIf the path is 1 meter broad all around, then the length and width of the outer rectangle would each be increased by 2 meters (1m on each side). So, if the original plot has length L and width W, then the outer rectangle would have length L + 2 and width W + 2. \n\nThe area of the path would then be ( (L + 2)*(W + 2) ) - (L * W). Let me compute that:\n\nExpanding (L+2)(W+2) gives L*W + 2L + 2W +4. Subtracting L*W leaves 2L + 2W +4. \n\nSo the area of the path is 2(L + W) +4. \n\nBut the perimeter of the original plot is 2(L + W) = 340. So substituting that in, the area becomes 340 +4, because 2(L+W) is 340. Wait, so 2(L+W) is exactly the perimeter. So the area of the path is 340 +4 = 344 square meters. \n\nWait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. \n\nYes, because:\n\nArea of path = ( (L+2)(W+2) - L*W ) = 2L + 2W +4. \n\nWhich factors as 2(L + W) +4. Since 2(L+W) is the perimeter, which is 340. So substituting gives 340 +4 = 344. \n\nThen, the cost is 344 *10 = 3440. So the answer should be C)3440. \n\nWait, but hold on. Wait a second, is that correct? Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says the boundary is 1-meter broad around the plot. But is there any assumption here that the path is only on the outside? Because if the plot is, say, surrounded by the path, then the outer rectangle is indeed L+2 and W+2. But perhaps the question is about the area of the boundary (the path), which would be that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me consider an example. Let's suppose the rectangle is a square. Let's say the perimeter is 340, so each side is 340/4 =85 meters. Then the area of the path would be (85+2)*(85+2) -85*85 = (87)^2 -85\u00b2 = (87-85)(87+85) = 2*172=344. Exactly. So in that case, yes, the area is 344. \n\nAnother example: suppose the rectangle is very long and skinny. Let's say length is 170, width is 0 (but that's degenerate). Wait, but perimeter would be 2*(170 +0) = 340? Wait, no. Wait, 2*(L+W)=340, so L+W=170. Let's pick L=160 and W=10. Then the original area is 160*10=1600. \n\nThe path's area would be (160+2)*(10+2) -160*10 = 162*12 -1600 = 1944 -1600 = 344. Again, same result. \n\nOh! Wait, so regardless of the actual dimensions, as long as the perimeter is 340, the area of the 1m path is always 344? Because the formula gives 2(L+W) +4. Since 2(L+W) is the perimeter (340), then adding 4 gives 344. \n\nSo that's brilliant. So the area is indeed 344. Then the cost is 344 *10= 3440. \n\nLooking at the options, C is 3440. So the answer must be C. \n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None. \n\nSo according to this, C is correct. But why would someone think it can't be determined? Because they might think that without knowing the actual length and width, you can't compute the area. But the calculation shows that the perimeter is sufficient. So the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm, but I need to make sure that there isn't a mistake in my formula. Let me re-derive the area of the path again. \n\nOriginal area is L*W. The path is 1m around, so the outer dimensions are (L + 2*1) and (W + 2*1). So the outer area is (L+2)(W+2). The path area is the difference between the outer and inner areas. \n\n(L+2)(W+2) - L*W = LW +2L +2W +4 - LW = 2L +2W +4. \n\nFactor out the 2: 2(L + W) +4. \n\nBut the perimeter of the original plot is 2(L + W) = 340. Therefore, substituting, the area is 340 +4 = 344. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the area is 344, so cost is 3440. So answer is C. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is C.\n",
