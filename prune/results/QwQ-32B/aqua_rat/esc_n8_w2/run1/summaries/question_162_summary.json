      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a 10kg mixture that's 30% sand and 70% clay. The goal is to make it so that there's an equal amount of clay and sand. So, we need to figure out how much of the original mixture we should remove and replace with pure sand to achieve that.\n\nFirst, let me think. The current composition is 30% sand, which is 3kg (since 10kg * 0.3), and 70% clay, which is 7kg. We want the final mixture to have equal parts clay and sand, so each should be 5kg. Since the total mixture remains 10kg, right?\n\nThe tricky part is figuring out how much to remove and replace. Let me recall the formula for these types of problems. I think when you remove a portion of the mixture and replace it with another substance, the amount of the original component decreases by the fraction removed. \n\nLet me denote the amount to be removed and replaced as x kg. Since the mixture is being removed, which has 30% sand and 70% clay, when we take out x kg, we're removing 0.3x kg of sand and 0.7x kg of clay. Then, we add back x kg of pure sand. \n\nSo, the new amount of sand would be original sand minus the sand removed plus the pure sand added. The clay will be original clay minus the clay removed (since we don't add any more clay). \n\nLet me write that out:\n\nNew sand = (3 - 0.3x) + x\nNew clay = 7 - 0.7x\n\nWe want these two to be equal. So:\n\n3 - 0.3x + x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nSimplify the left side: 3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nCombine like terms. Let's add 0.7x to both sides:\n\n3 + 1.4x =7\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n1.4x =4 \n\nHmm, solving for x gives x = 4 / 1.4. Let me calculate that. 4 divided by 1.4 is the same as 40/14, which simplifies to 20/7. Wait, 4 divided by 1.4 is like multiplying numerator and denominator by 10 to get 40/14, then divide numerator and denominator by 2 gives 20/7. So that's approximately 2.857 kg.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 20/7. That seems right. Let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nOriginal sand: 3 kg. After removing x kg of mixture (which has 0.3x sand), so remaining sand is 3 -0.3x. Then adding x sand: total is 3 -0.3x +x =3 +0.7x.\n\nClay: original 7kg minus 0.7x (since each kg removed has 0.7 clay). So 7 -0.7x.\n\nSet equal: 3 +0.7x =7 -0.7x. Moving terms: 0.7x +0.7x =7-3 \u2192 1.4x=4 \u2192 x=4/1.4= 2.857... which is indeed 20/7. So the answer must be option B.\n\nWait, just to confirm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me see another way. Suppose we remove x kg of the mixture and replace with x kg sand. The total mixture remains 10 kg. The concentration of clay will be (7 - 0.7x)/10, and sand will be (3 -0.3x +x)/10. Setting those equal gives the same equation. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about mixing sand and clay. Let me see. The question is, there's a 10kg mixture that's 30% sand and 70% clay. They want to know how much of the mixture needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand so that the final mixture has equal parts sand and clay. The options are given as fractions like 10/7, 20/7, etc. Hmm, I need to think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the problem. The initial mixture is 10 kg total. 30% is sand, so that's 3 kg of sand and 7 kg of clay. The goal is to have equal amounts of sand and clay, so each would be 5 kg in a 10kg mixture. So, we need to add some sand and remove some clay? Wait, but the process is removing some of the mixture and replacing it with pure sand. So when we remove part of the mixture, we're taking out both sand and clay in the same ratio they're present, then adding back pure sand. That should change the proportions.\n\nLet me think of the variables. Let x be the amount to be removed and replaced with pure sand. Since the total remains 10kg, removing x kg and adding x kg sand keeps the total the same. \n\nThe key here is figuring out how the sand and clay quantities change. When we remove x kg of the original mixture, which is 30% sand and 70% clay, so the amount of sand removed would be 0.3x and clay removed 0.7x. Then, we add back x kg of pure sand. So the new amount of sand will be (original sand - removed sand + added sand), and the clay will be (original clay - removed clay).\n\nLet me write that down mathematically. \n\nOriginal sand: 3 kg. After removing x kg of mixture, the remaining sand is 3 - 0.3x. Then adding x kg of pure sand, so total sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x.\n\nClay: Original is 7 kg. After removing x kg of mixture, the remaining clay is 7 - 0.7x. Since we're not adding any clay, that's the new clay amount.\n\nWe want the final mixture to have equal parts sand and clay, so:\n\nSand = Clay\n\nSo, 3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nHmm, solving for x here. Let's do that:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nCombine like terms. Let's add 0.7x to both sides:\n\n3 + 1.4x =7\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n1.4x =4\n\nThen x=4 /1.4. Let me compute that. 4 divided by 1.4. Well, 1.4 is 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4*(10/14) = 40/14 = 20/7. So x is 20/7. Wait, that's option B. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to be sure. Because sometimes when you remove and replace, maybe I missed something. Let me verify each part again.\n\nOriginal sand: 3 kg. When I take out x kg of the mixture, the sand removed is 0.3x, so remaining sand is 3 -0.3x. Then adding x kg sand, so total sand is 3 -0.3x +x = 3 +0.7x. That looks right. \n\nClay: original 7 kg, removed 0.7x, so remaining 7 -0.7x. Correct. \n\nSetting equal: 3 +0.7x = 7-0.7x. Yes, solving gives 1.4x =4, so x=4/1.4. \n\nYes, 4 divided by 1.4. Multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to get 40/14, which simplifies to 20/7. So that's B. \n\nHmm, but let me think of another way to approach this problem, maybe using concentration. \n\nAlternatively, the idea is that when you remove a portion of the mixture and replace it, the concentration of the original components changes. \n\nThe initial concentration of clay is 70%, and we want it to be 50%. Since we are replacing some of the mixture (which has 70% clay) with pure sand (0% clay), the final concentration of clay will decrease. \n\nThe formula for such replacement problems is sometimes given by C_final = C_initial*(1 - x/V)^n, but in this case, since it's a single replacement, maybe we can model it as:\n\nThe amount of clay after removal and replacement would be (original clay) - (clay removed) + (clay added). But since we are adding pure sand, the clay added is zero. So, the clay remains at 7 - 0.7x. \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the remaining quantity after removal and replacement is similar to mixture problems. \n\nAlternatively, think of the total clay. We need the clay to be 5 kg (since equal parts in 10kg). The original clay is 7kg, so we need to remove 2 kg of clay. \n\nBut when you remove x kg of the mixture, you remove 0.7x kg of clay. So to get rid of 2 kg of clay, set 0.7x =2 \u2192 x=2/0.7 = 20/7. Which is the same answer. Oh, that's a simpler way. \n\nBecause the amount of clay must reduce from 7 to 5, so we need to remove 2 kg of clay. Since each x kg of mixture removed has 0.7x clay, so 0.7x =2 \u2192 x=20/7. Exactly. That's a quicker way. \n\nSo either method gives the same result. So the answer is B)20/7. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here, so I think that's correct.\n",
