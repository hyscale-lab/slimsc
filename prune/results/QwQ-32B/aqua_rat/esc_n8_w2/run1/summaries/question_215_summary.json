      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about mixing orange juice in a soft drink to increase its percentage. The original mixture is 1 gallon, with 40% orange juice and 60% water. They want to know how much more orange juice needs to be added so that orange juice becomes 60% of the new mixture. \n\nAlright, so initially, there's 0.4 gallons of orange juice (since 40% of 1 gallon is 0.4) and 0.6 gallons of water. The goal is to have the orange juice make up 60% of the total. Let me think about how adding more orange juice will affect the total volume and the concentration.\n\nLet me denote the amount of additional orange juice to add as x gallons. When we add x gallons of orange juice, the total amount of orange juice becomes (0.4 + x) gallons. The total volume of the new mixture will then be (1 + x) gallons because we're adding x to the original 1 gallon. \n\nThe key equation here is that the new concentration of orange juice should be 60%, so:\n\n(0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6\n\nNow I need to solve this equation for x. Let's do the algebra step by step. Multiply both sides by (1 + x) to get rid of the denominator:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6*(1 + x)\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nNow, subtract 0.6x from both sides and also subtract 0.4 from both sides to get:\n\nx - 0.6x = 0.6 - 0.4\n\nThat simplifies to:\n\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nDividing both sides by 0.4 gives:\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5\n\nWait, but that would mean 0.5 gallons? Let me check the options. Option A is 0.5. But I feel like maybe I made a mistake here because sometimes when you add more of a component, the calculation might be different. Let me double-check the steps.\n\nOriginal OJ: 0.4, adding x gives 0.4+x. Total volume is 1 + x. The desired concentration is 60%, so the equation is correct. Let me plug x=0.5 back into the equation to confirm:\n\n(0.4 +0.5)/(1+0.5) = 0.9/1.5 = 0.6, which is 60%. Oh right, that works. So the answer would be 0.5? But wait, the options include A as 0.5, so that would be correct. But I have a feeling maybe the question is a bit tricky. Wait, the question says \"additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink\". So yes, that's exactly what the equation represents. Hmm, but I remember sometimes when you add pure substance, the way the percentages work might be different. Wait, let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it using the concept of conservation of mass for the water, since the water's percentage isn't changing, but maybe that's another way.\n\nThe original mixture has 0.6 gallons of water, which is 60% of the original 1 gallon. After adding x gallons of OJ, the total volume becomes (1 + x), and the water remains 0.6 gallons. Since water will now be 40% of the new mixture (because OJ is 60%), so 0.6 = 0.4*(1 +x). Let's see:\n\n0.6 = 0.4*(1+x)\nDivide both sides by 0.4: 0.6 /0.4 = 1 +x \u2192 1.5 =1 +x \u2192 x=0.5. \n\nSame result. So that confirms it. So the answer should be A)0.5? But wait, looking at the options given, the first option is 0.5. But I thought maybe I was missing something. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. The question says \"how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?\" So the answer is indeed 0.5. But let me check the options again. The options are A)0.5, B)1, C)1.25, D)1.5, E)2. So A is correct. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Because sometimes these problems can be tricky with the way they're phrased. Let me try plugging in another option to see.\n\nSuppose someone thought that since originally it's 40% and they want 60%, maybe they need to double it? But that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, maybe they think in terms of ratios. Let me see another approach.\n\nThe initial amount of OJ is 0.4. Let\u2019s say we add x gallons of pure OJ. The new concentration is (0.4 + x)/(1 +x) = 0.6. Solving that equation as before gives x=0.5. So that's correct. So the answer should be A. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems can be counterintuitive. Wait, maybe I need to check the algebra again. Let me re-derive the equation.\n\nStarting with the equation:\n\n(0.4 + x) = 0.6*(1 + x)\n\nLeft side is OJ after adding x. Right side is 60% of total volume.\n\nExpanding the right side gives 0.6 +0.6x.\n\nSubtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4 +x -0.6x =0.6 \u2192 0.4 +0.4x =0.6 \u2192 0.4x=0.2 \u2192 x=0.5. Yep, same result.\n\nHmm, so the answer should be A. But why is there an option C (1.25) and others? Maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the water remains the same. Wait, the water is 0.6 gallons initially. After adding x OJ, the water is still 0.6, which is 40% of total. So total would be 0.6 /0.4 =1.5. So the total is 1.5, so added 0.5. Yep, that's consistent. So I think I'm correct. So the answer is A)0.5. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Suppose someone thought that you need to have 60% OJ in the final, so maybe they set up the equation as (original OJ + x)/(original total +x) =0.6, which is exactly what I did. So yeah. Then the answer is A. So maybe the correct answer is A. But why am I second-guessing? Let me check with another method. \n\nAlternative method: Let\u2019s consider the amount of OJ and the total. Let\u2019s let x be the amount added. The final OJ is 0.4 +x, and total is 1 +x. The ratio (0.4 +x)/(1+x) = 0.6. Cross multiplying, 0.4 +x =0.6 +0.6x \u2192 x-0.6x =0.6-0.4 \u2192 0.4x =0.2 \u2192x=0.5. Same result. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where adding 0.5 is correct, so the answer is A. Hmm. Well, I think that's the right answer. Maybe the options are trying to trick people who miscalculate. For example, someone might subtract 40% from 60% and think 20% difference, so 0.2, but that's not how mixtures work. Or maybe they thought in terms of the ratio of OJ to water. Let me see. \n\nOriginally, the ratio of OJ to water is 40:60, which is 2:3. After adding x OJ, the ratio should be 60:40 (OJ to water?), wait no, OJ is 60% so the ratio of OJ to total is 60%, so water is 40%. The water remains at 0.6 gallons. So the new total is (0.6)/(0.4) =1.5. So the added amount is 0.5. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the water's amount is 0.6, and now it's 40%, so total is 1.5, so they need to add 0.5. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A)0.5.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with 1 gallon of soft drink containing 40% orange juice (OJ) and 60% water.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about mixing orange juice in a soft drink. Hmm. The original drink is 1 gallon, right? And it's 40% orange juice and 60% water. So the question is asking how much more orange juice we need to add to make the orange juice content 60% of the new mixture. \n\nWait, so the goal is to have 60% OJ. Let me think. Let me set up the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the original mixture is 1 gallon. 40% of that is OJ, so that's 0.4 gallons of OJ. The rest is water, which is 0.6 gallons. Now, we need to add some amount of OJ, let's call it x gallons, to this mixture. The total volume after adding will be 1 + x gallons. \n\nThe new amount of OJ will be the original 0.4 plus the added x. And we want this to be 60% of the total. So the equation would be:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6*(1 + x)\n\nHmm, right. Let me check that equation again. The left side is the total OJ after adding x, and the right side is 60% of the total new volume. \n\nSolving for x:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x  \nx - 0.6x = 0.6 - 0.4  \n0.4x = 0.2  \nx = 0.2 / 0.4  \nx = 0.5\n\nWait, but that gives me 0.5, which is option A. But I remember sometimes when these mixture problems are done, maybe there's a different way. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the water remaining the same. Since water is 60% of the original, which is 0.6 gallons. After adding OJ, the total mixture will have the same amount of water, but it will now be a smaller percentage. Wait, if OJ is 60%, then water would be 40% of the new mixture. \n\nSo the water's 0.6 gallons is 40% of the new total. Let me see:\n\nLet the new total be T. Then 0.4*T = 0.6 \u2192 T = 0.6 / 0.4 = 1.5 gallons. \n\nOriginal was 1 gallon, so the added OJ is 1.5 -1 = 0.5. So that also gives 0.5, which is A. \n\nHmm, but I thought maybe the answer would be higher. Wait, but the options include 0.5 as option A. So that would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me check again the first method. \n\nOriginal OJ: 0.4. Add x, so total OJ is 0.4 +x. Total volume is 1 +x. \n\nWe want (0.4 +x)/(1 +x) = 0.6. \n\nCross multiplying: 0.4 +x =0.6(1+x). \n\nExpanding the right side: 0.6 +0.6x. \n\nThen subtract 0.6x and 0.4 from both sides:\n\nx -0.6x =0.6-0.4 \u2192 0.4x =0.2 \u2192 x=0.5. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is 0.5, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in\"\u2014so adding 0.5 gallons would make the OJ 60%? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the ratio. The initial concentration is 40%, and we want to get to 60%. Since we are adding pure OJ (100% concentration), maybe using the concept of mixtures. \n\nLet me use the formula:\n\nLet x be the amount added. \n\nThe amount of OJ before adding: 0.4. \n\nAfter adding x, the total OJ is 0.4 +x. \n\nThe total volume is 1 +x. \n\nSet (0.4 +x)/(1+x) = 0.6 \u2192 same equation again. \n\nSo the answer is 0.5, so A. \n\nHmm, but maybe I'm missing something here. Let me see. Suppose I add 0.5 gallons of OJ to 1 gallon of the original drink. The new total is 1.5 gallons. \n\nOriginal OJ was 0.4, so new OJ is 0.4 +0.5 =0.9. 0.9 divided by 1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. That checks out. \n\nSo the answer is A. But why does the option C (1.25) exist? Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says \"how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?\" So, the original is 1 gallon. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when you add OJ, the total increases, so the equation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in considering the water's percentage. Let me check with the second approach again. \n\nOriginal water is 0.6 gallons. After adding x OJ, the total volume is 1+x. The water is now 0.6, which is 40% of the total (since OJ is 60%). \n\nSo 0.6 = 0.4*(1+x). \n\nSolving for 1+x = 0.6 /0.4 = 1.5 \u2192 x = 0.5. \n\nSame result. \n\nHmm. So the answer must be A. But let me check the options again. The options are A)0.5, B)1, C)1.25, D)1.5, E)2. \n\nSo A is indeed an option. Then why do I feel like maybe the answer is different? Maybe I'm overcomplicating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in\"\u2014so maybe they consider the OJ being added as pure, which we did. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another way. Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question. Wait, the original is 40% OJ. To get to 60%, you need to add OJ. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented as \"to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink\"\u2014so the new mixture must be 60% OJ. \n\nHmm, all my calculations point to 0.5, so the answer is A.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about mixing orange juice in a soft drink. Hmm. The original drink is 1 gallon, right? And it's 40% orange juice and 60% water. So the question is asking how much more orange juice we need to add to make the orange juice content 60% of the new mixture. \n\nWait, so the goal is to have 60% OJ. Let me think. Let me set up the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the original mixture is 1 gallon. 40% of that is OJ, so that's 0.4 gallons of OJ. The rest is water, which is 0.6 gallons. Now, we need to add some amount of OJ, let's call it x gallons, to this mixture. The total volume after adding will be 1 + x gallons. \n\nThe new amount of OJ will be the original 0.4 plus the added x. And we want this to be 60% of the total. So the equation would be:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6*(1 + x)\n\nHmm, right. Let me check that equation again. The left side is the total OJ after adding x, and the right side is 60% of the total new volume. \n\nSolving for x:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x  \nx - 0.6x = 0.6 - 0.4  \n0.4x = 0.2  \nx = 0.2 / 0.4  \nx = 0.5\n\nWait, but that gives me 0.5, which is option A. But I remember sometimes when these mixture problems are done, maybe there's a different way. Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the water remaining the same. Since water is 60% of the original, which is 0.6 gallons. After adding OJ, the total mixture will have the same amount of water, but it will now be a smaller percentage. Wait, if OJ is 60%, then water would be 40% of the new mixture. \n\nSo the water's 0.6 gallons is 40% of the new total. Let me see:\n\nLet the new total be T. Then 0.4*T = 0.6 \u2192 T = 0.6 / 0.4 = 1.5 gallons. \n\nOriginal was 1 gallon, so the added OJ is 1.5 -1 = 0.5. So that also gives 0.5, which is A. \n\nHmm, but I thought maybe the answer would be higher. Wait, but the options include 0.5 as option A. So that would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me check again the first method. \n\nOriginal OJ: 0.4. Add x, so total OJ is 0.4 +x. Total volume is 1 +x. \n\nWe want (0.4 +x)/(1 +x) = 0.6. \n\nCross multiplying: 0.4 +x =0.6(1+x). \n\nExpanding the right side: 0.6 +0.6x. \n\nThen subtract 0.6x and 0.4 from both sides:\n\nx -0.6x =0.6-0.4 \u2192 0.4x =0.2 \u2192 x=0.5. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is 0.5, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, the question says \"additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in\"\u2014so adding 0.5 gallons would make the OJ 60%? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of it as the ratio. The initial concentration is 40%, and we want to get to 60%. Since we are adding pure OJ (100% concentration), maybe using the concept of mixtures. \n\nLet me use the formula:\n\nLet x be the amount added. \n\nThe amount of OJ before adding: 0.4. \n\nAfter adding x, the total OJ is 0.4 +x. \n\nThe total volume is 1 +x. \n\nSet (0.4 +x)/(1+x) = 0.6 \u2192 same equation again. \n\nSo the answer is 0.5, so A. \n\nHmm, but maybe I'm missing something here. Let me see. Suppose I add 0.5 gallons of OJ to 1 gallon of the original drink. The new total is 1.5 gallons. \n\nOriginal OJ was 0.4, so new OJ is 0.4 +0.5 =0.9. 0.9 divided by 1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. That checks out. \n\nSo the answer is A. But why does the option C (1.25) exist? Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the question. The question says \"how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?\" So, the original is 1 gallon. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that when you add OJ, the total increases, so the equation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in considering the water's percentage. Let me check with the second approach again. \n\nOriginal water is 0.6 gallons. After adding x OJ, the total volume is 1+x. The water is now 0.6, which is 40% of the total (since OJ is 60%). \n\nSo 0.6 = 0.4*(1+x). \n\nSolving for 1+x = 0.6 /0.4 = 1.5 \u2192 x = 0.5. \n\nSame result. \n\nHmm. So the answer must be A. But let me check the options again. The options are A)0.5, B)1, C)1.25, D)1.5, E)2. \n\nSo A is indeed an option. Then why do I feel like maybe the answer is different? Maybe I'm overcomplicating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in\"\u2014so maybe they consider the OJ being added as pure, which we did. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another way. Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question. Wait, the original is 40% OJ. To get to 60%, you need to add OJ. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is presented as \"to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink\"\u2014so the new mixture must be 60% OJ. \n\nHmm, all my calculations point to 0.5, so the answer is A. Maybe the options are correct. \n\nHmm. I think the correct answer is A)0.5. So the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with 1 gallon of soft drink that is 40% orange juice (OJ) and 60% water. This means the initial amount of OJ is \\(0.4\\) gallons, and the water is \\(0.6\\) gallons. We need to determine how much additional OJ (\\(x\\) gallons) must be added to make OJ 60% of the new mixture.\n\nThe total volume after adding \\(x\\) gallons of OJ will be \\(1 + x\\) gallons. The total OJ in the new mixture will be \\(0.4 + x\\) gallons. We set up the equation for OJ being 60% of the new mixture:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x) \\\\\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x \\\\\nx - 0.6x = 0.6 - 0.4 \\\\\n0.4x = 0.2 \\\\\nx = \\frac{0.2}{0.4} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nAnother approach confirms this result by considering the water content, which remains constant at \\(0.6\\) gallons. Since water becomes 40% of the new mixture, the total volume \\(T\\) satisfies:\n\n\\[\n0.4T = 0.6 \\implies T = \\frac{0.6}{0.4} = 1.5 \\text{ gallons}\n\\]\n\nThe added OJ is \\(1.5 - 1 = 0.5\\) gallons. Both methods confirm that \\(0.5\\) gallons of OJ must be added. The correct answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
