      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about the height of a room and the cost to paper the walls. The ratio given is height to semi-perimeter is 2:5. And there's some cost information involving paper. Let me try to parse all this.\n\nFirst, let's note down the given data. The ratio of height (h) to semi-perimeter (s) is 2:5. So h/s = 2/5. Wait, semi-perimeter of what? Since it's a room, I think the semi-perimeter would be half the perimeter of the floor, right? Because the perimeter of the room's floor would be 2*(length + width), so the semi-perimeter would be (length + width). Wait, actually, maybe the semi-perimeter here refers to the perimeter of the four walls? Wait, no, probably not. Because the semi-perimeter of the room in terms of the floor's dimensions. Let me think again. \n\nThe term semi-perimeter usually is half the perimeter. So if the room's floor is a rectangle, its perimeter would be 2*(length + width). So semi-perimeter would be (length + width). So the ratio h/(length + width) is 2:5. So h = (2/5)*(length + width). Got that.\n\nNow, the cost to paper the walls is given. Let me see the details. The cost is Rs.260, using paper that's 50 cm wide, priced at Rs.2 per meter. They also allow an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So the total cost is calculated based on the area of the walls minus the area for doors and windows, right?\n\nLet me structure the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the area to be papered is the lateral surface area of the room (the walls) minus the area for doors and windows. The lateral surface area (since it's a rectangular room) would be perimeter of the floor multiplied by the height. The perimeter is 2*(length + width), so the lateral area is 2*(l + w)*h. Then subtract 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\n\nThe cost is based on the area of the paper used. The paper is 50 cm wide, so each meter of paper (since the width is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters) would cover an area of 1m (length) * 0.5m (width) = 0.5 square meters per meter of paper. Wait, actually, when you buy paper by the meter, the length is the variable here. Let me think again. The paper is sold per meter, and each meter is 50 cm wide. So each meter of paper (in length) would cover an area of 0.5 m (width) times 1 m (length) = 0.5 m\u00b2 per meter of paper. \n\nAlternatively, the total area required is (Area of walls - 15). Let me denote the required area as A. Then, the number of meters of paper needed would be A divided by the width (in meters) of the paper. Because the area is width * length (of the paper). So length of paper required is (Area needed) / (width of paper). \n\nSo the cost is (length of paper in meters) multiplied by the cost per meter (Rs.2). \n\nPutting this together:\n\nTotal cost = [ (Lateral Surface Area - 15) / (0.5) ] * 2 \n\nWait, let me re-express that. Let me denote:\n\nLet total_area_needed = (2*(l + w)*h) - 15.\n\nThe paper's width is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. So the length of paper required (in meters) would be total_area_needed / (0.5). Because each meter of paper gives 0.5 m\u00b2 of area. So length of paper is total_area_needed / (width). \n\nTherefore, the cost is (total_area_needed / 0.5) * 2. \n\nWait, because the cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. So the cost would be ( (total_area_needed / 0.5) ) * 2. Let me compute that:\n\nTotal cost = ( ( (2*(l + w)*h -15 ) / 0.5 ) ) * 2 \n\nWait, simplifying that: dividing by 0.5 is multiplying by 2, so that becomes (2*(l +w)*h -15)*2 *2? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-calculate step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute the total area first, then find how much paper is needed. The cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. Since each meter of paper has an area of 0.5 m\u00b2, the cost per square meter of paper would be (Rs.2)/0.5 = Rs.4 per square meter. Wait, that might be an easier way to think. Because each square meter of paper costs 2/(0.5) = 4 Rs. So the total cost would be (Area_needed) * 4. \n\nWait, let me see. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose you need an area of A (in m\u00b2). The paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m), so the length of paper required is A / 0.5 m. Since each meter of paper is 0.5 m wide. So the length (in meters) is (A / 0.5). Then the cost is (length) * Rs.2 per meter. So:\n\nCost = (A / 0.5) * 2 = (A * 2)/0.5 = A *4. So yes, the cost is 4 times the area needed. \n\nSo, the total cost is 4*(Total Area) = 260. Therefore, 4*( (2*(l + w)*h -15 )) = 260. \n\nWait, the total area needed is (2*(l +w)*h -15). So substituting:\n\n4*(2*(l +w)*h -15) = 260\n\nDivide both sides by 4: \n\n2*(l +w)*h -15 = 65 \n\nThen 2*(l +w)*h = 65 +15 = 80 \n\nSo 2*(l +w)*h =80 \n\nHmm, but we also have the ratio h/(l + w) = 2/5. Let me denote that h = (2/5)*(l +w). \n\nLet me let s = l + w. Then h = (2/5)s. \n\nSo substituting into the equation 2*s*h =80. \n\nWait, because 2*(l +w)*h = 2*s*h =80. \n\nSince h = (2/5)s, substituting:\n\n2*s*(2/5 s) =80 \n\nSo 2*(2/5)*s^2 =80 \n\nThat's (4/5)s\u00b2 =80 \n\nMultiply both sides by 5/4: s\u00b2 = 80*(5/4) = 100 \n\nSo s\u00b2 =100 \u2192 s=10 (since length can't be negative). \n\nThus, s = l + w =10 meters. \n\nThen h = (2/5)*10 = 4 meters. \n\nWait, so the height is 4 meters? Looking at the options, option C is 4m. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again to make sure. \n\nLet me go through again:\n\nThe problem states the ratio of height to semi-perimeter is 2:5. The semi-perimeter here must be (l + w), since the full perimeter is 2(l + w), so semi-perimeter is half of that, but wait wait, no. Wait, semi-perimeter usually is half the perimeter. Wait, the perimeter of the room's floor is 2(l + w). Then semi-perimeter would be (2(l +w))/2 = (l + w). So the ratio h/(l +w) =2/5. That's correct. \n\nThen, the area to be papered is the lateral surface area minus 15. The lateral surface area is perimeter times height, so 2(l +w)*h. So yes, 2(l +w)*h -15. \n\nThe cost calculation: \n\nThe paper is 50cm wide (0.5m), so each meter of paper gives 0.5 m\u00b2. \n\nTotal area needed is (2(l +w)h -15). \n\nThe length of paper needed is (Area)/0.5. \n\nThe cost is (length) * 2 (since Rs.2 per meter). \n\nThus, cost = ( (2(l +w)h -15)/0.5 ) *2 \n\nWhich simplifies to (2(l +w)h -15) *4. \n\nSet equal to 260:\n\n4*(2(l +w)h -15) =260 \u2192 2(l +w)h -15 =65 \u2192 2(l +w)h =80. \n\nThen, since h = (2/5)(l +w), substituting:\n\n2*(l +w)*(2/5)(l +w) =80 \u2192 (4/5)(l +w)^2 =80 \u2192 (l +w)^2 = 100 \u2192 l +w=10. \n\nThus h = (2/5)*10 =4. \n\nSo the height is 4 meters. So option C is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)2.6m\n\nB)3.9m\n\nC)4m\n\nD)4.2m\n\nE)4.4m\n\nSo C is 4, which matches. \n\nHmm, but let me think again if I made any mistake in the cost calculation. Let me verify the cost steps again. \n\nSuppose the area needed is A = (perimeter * height) -15. \n\nThe paper's width is 0.5m. So the length of the paper required would be total_area / width. \n\nBecause, for example, if you have an area of A, then length * width = A \u2192 length = A / width. \n\nThe length here is in meters, so the total length needed is (A) / (0.5). \n\nThen, the cost is (length) * 2 (since each meter of length costs Rs2). \n\nSo cost = (A / 0.5)*2 = (2A)/0.5 = 4A. \n\nSo the total cost is 4*A. \n\nSet that to 260 \u2192 4*A =260 \u2192 A =65. \n\nWait, wait, hold on! Wait a second, this contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, in my first approach I had 4*(2(l +w)h -15) =260. So that gives A = (2(l +w)h -15) = 65. But in this way, 2(l +w)h -15 =65 \u2192 2(l +w)h =80. Which is same as before. So that part is okay. \n\nHmm, but I think my calculation is correct. So the answer is 4 meters, which is option C. \n\nWait, but let me see the options again. The problem is maybe in the semi-perimeter? Let me confirm again. \n\nThe question says the height to semi-perimeter is 2:5. \n\nIf semi-perimeter is (l + w), then h/(l +w)=2/5. \n\nYes. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the semi-perimeter refers to the perimeter of the walls? But the walls' perimeter would be the same as the perimeter of the floor times height? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the semi-perimeter is half the perimeter of the walls? But the walls are four walls, so their perimeter (the total length of the edges?) but that's not standard. \n\nNo, the term semi-perimeter in the context of a room's dimensions would refer to half the perimeter of the floor. Because the perimeter of the floor is 2(l +w), so semi would be l +w. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be C)4m. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options, option B is 3.9. Let me see if I messed up any numbers. \n\nWait, let me re-calculate the steps numerically. \n\nWe had:\n\nAfter substituting h = (2/5)s where s = l + w,\n\nThe equation becomes 2*s*(2/5 s) =80 ?\n\nWait, let me compute that again. \n\nOriginal equation after substitution:\n\n2*(l +w)*h =80 \u2192 2*s*h =80. \n\nh is (2/5)s. \n\nThus 2*s*(2/5 s) = (4/5)s\u00b2 =80 \u2192 s\u00b2 = (80 *5)/4 = 100. \n\nSo s is 10, so h = (2/5)*10 =4. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is C. But why is there an option B? Let me check if I made a mistake in the cost equation. \n\nLet me re-calculate the cost step again. \n\nSuppose the total area to be covered is (perimeter * height) -15. \n\nPerimeter is 2(l +w), so total area = 2*(l +w)*h -15. \n\nThe paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. So the required length of the paper is (total area) divided by 0.5 m. \n\nEach meter of paper is 0.5 m in width, so for each meter length, you get 0.5 m\u00b2. \n\nSo total length required = (Total area) / 0.5 = 2*(Total area). \n\nThen, the cost is (length in meters) multiplied by Rs.2 per meter. \n\nSo total cost = (2*(Total area)) *2 =4*(Total area). \n\nWait, so total cost =4*(Total area). \n\nBut the total area is (2(l +w)h -15). \n\nSo 4*(2(l +w)h -15) =260 \n\nSo 2(l +w)h -15 = 65 \n\nSo 2(l +w)h =80 \u2192 correct. \n\nYes, so that's right. \n\nHmm, I think the answer is definitely C)4m. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the ratio? Let me check again. \n\nThe problem says the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. \n\nHeight : semi-perimeter =2:5. \n\nSo h/(semi-perimeter) =2/5. \n\nSince semi-perimeter is (l +w), that ratio holds. \n\nYes, so h =2/5*(l +w). \n\nThus, all steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C)4m. \n",

The cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper. Since each meter of paper has an area of 0.5 m\u00b2, the cost per square meter of paper would be (Rs.2)/0.5 = Rs.4 per square meter. Wait, that might be an easier way to think. Because each square meter of paper costs 2/(0.5) = 4 Rs. So the total cost would be (Area_needed) * 4. \n\nWait, let me see. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose you need an area of A (in m\u00b2). The paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m), so the length of paper required is A / 0.5 m. Since each meter of paper is 0.5 m wide. So the length (in meters) is (A / 0.5). Then the cost is (length) * Rs.2 per meter. So:\n\nCost = (A / 0.5) * 2 = (A * 2)/0.5 = A *4. So yes, the cost is 4 times the area needed. \n\nSo, the total cost is 4*(Total Area) = 260. Therefore, 4*( (2*(l + w)*h -15 )) = 260. \n\nWait, the total area needed is (2*(l +w)*h -15).

But why is there an option B? Let me check if I made a mistake in the cost equation. \n\nLet me re-calculate the cost step again. \n\nSuppose the total area to be covered is (perimeter * height) -15. \n\nPerimeter is 2(l +w), so total area = 2*(l +w)*h -15. \n\nThe paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 m. So the required length of the paper is (total area) divided by 0.5 m. \n\nEach meter of paper is 0.5 m in width, so for each meter length, you get 0.5 m\u00b2. \n\nSo total length required = (Total area) / 0.5 = 2*(Total area). \n\nThen, the cost is (length in meters) multiplied by Rs.2 per meter. \n\nSo total cost = (2*(Total area)) *2 =4*(Total area). \n\nWait, so total cost =4*(Total area). \n\nBut the total area is (2(l +w)h -15). \n\nSo 4*(2(l +w)h -15) =260 \n\nSo 2(l +w)h -15 = 65 \n\nSo 2(l +w)h =80 \u2192 correct. \n\nYes, so that's right. \n\nHmm, I think the answer is definitely C)4m. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the ratio? Let me check again. \n\nThe problem says the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. \n\nHeight : semi-perimeter =2:5. \n\nSo h/(semi-perimeter) =2/5. \n\nSince semi-perimeter is (l +w), that ratio holds. \n\nYes, so h =2/5*(l +w). \n\nThus, all steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C)4m. \n\n\nThe height of the room (h) to its semi-perimeter (l + w) is given as 2:5. This implies \\( h = \\frac{2}{5}(l + w) \\). The cost to paper the walls is Rs. 260, using paper priced at Rs. 2 per meter, with a width of 50 cm (0.5 m). The total area to be papered is the lateral surface area minus 15 m\u00b2 for doors and windows. \n\nThe lateral surface area is \\( 2(l + w)h \\). The total area needed is \\( 2(l + w)h - 15 \\). The cost calculation involves converting this area to paper length:  \n\\[\n\\text{Cost} = \\left(\\frac{\\text{Area}}{0.5}\\right) \\times 2 = 4 \\times (\\text{Area}).\n\\]\nSetting the total cost to 260:  \n\\[\n4(2(l + w)h - 15) = 260 \\implies 2(l + w)h - 15 = 65 \\implies 2(l + w)h = 80.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( h = \\frac{2}{5}(l + w) \\):  \n\\[\n2(l + w)\\left(\\frac{2}{5}(l + w)\\right) = 80 \\implies \\frac{4}{5}(l + w)^2 = 80 \\implies (l + w)^2 = 100 \\implies l + w = 10.\n\\]\nThus,  \n\\[\nh = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 10 = 4 \\text{ meters}.\n\\]\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here about the height of a room and the cost to paper the walls. Hmm. The question gives a ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter as 2:5. And then there's information about the cost, the paper's width, price per meter, and an allowance for doors and windows. I need to find the height of the room. \n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The ratio of height to semi-perimeter is 2:5. Wait, semi-perimeter of what? Probably the floor, since the walls are around the room. So the semi-perimeter would be half the perimeter of the floor, right? Because the perimeter of the floor is 2*(length + breadth), so half of that would be (length + breadth). Wait, no, semi-perimeter usually is half the perimeter, so if the perimeter is 2(L+B), then semi-perimeter here would be L+B. Because (2(L+B))/2 is L+B. So the ratio is height : (L+B) = 2:5. \n\nThe cost is Rs.260 to paper the walls. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter of the paper is Rs.2. And they allow 15 sq.m for doors and windows, which means that area isn't covered. \n\nSo, the total area to be papered is the lateral surface area of the room (since it's the walls) minus the area for doors and windows. The lateral surface area would be the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height. So perimeter is 2*(L+B), and multiplied by height gives the total wall area. Then subtract 15 sq.m for doors and windows. \n\nThe cost is based on how much paper is needed. Since the paper is sold by the meter, and each meter is 0.5m wide, each meter of paper gives an area of 0.5 m\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, the paper is 50cm wide. So each meter of length would give an area of 0.5 m (width) * 1 m (length) = 0.5 m\u00b2 per meter of paper. Wait, actually, the cost is per meter, so maybe the price is per meter of the paper's length. Let me think again. \n\nLet me structure this step by step.\n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet the height be h meters. The semi-perimeter is (L + B), so according to the ratio h : (L+B) = 2:5. Therefore, h/(L+B) = 2/5 \u2192 L+B = (5h)/2. \n\nThe total area of the four walls is 2*(L+B)*h. Because each pair of walls (length x height and breadth x height) summed twice. So total wall area = 2*(L + B)*h. \n\nBut we have to subtract 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So the area to be covered is (2*(L+B)*h - 15). \n\nThis area must be equal to the area of the paper used. The paper is 50 cm (0.5 m) wide. The cost is given as Rs.2 per meter. So, the cost depends on how much paper is needed. \n\nThe area of the paper used is (length of paper in meters) multiplied by 0.5 meters (the width). Let me denote the length of paper as 'x' meters. Then the area covered by the paper is 0.5 * x. \n\nThe cost is Rs.2 per meter of paper's length, so total cost is 2*x = 260. \n\nSo, first, I can find x from the cost equation: 2x = 260 \u2192 x = 130 meters. \n\nTherefore, the area covered by the paper is 0.5 * 130 = 65 square meters. \n\nSo the equation becomes: \n\nTotal wall area minus 15 = 65 \u2192 2*(L+B)*h -15 =65 \u2192 2*(L+B)*h = 80 \u2192 (L+B)*h =40. \n\nBut from the ratio, L+B = (5h)/2. \n\nSubstituting that into (L+B)*h =40 gives:\n\n(5h/2)*h =40 \u2192 (5h\u00b2)/2 =40 \u2192 5h\u00b2 =80 \u2192 h\u00b2 =16 \u2192 h=4 meters. \n\nWait, so h is 4 meters? Let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the cost: the total cost is 260. Since the price is 2 per meter of paper's length, then the total length bought is 260 / 2 = 130 meters. Each meter of length contributes 0.5 m\u00b2 (since width is 0.5 m). So total paper area is 130 *0.5 =65 m\u00b2. \n\nTotal area to be covered is 65 +15 =80 m\u00b2 (since they subtract 15 for doors and windows). \n\nTotal wall area is 2*(L+B)*h. \n\nSo 2*(L+B)*h =80 \u2192 (L+B)*h=40. \n\nBut from the ratio, h/(L+B)=2/5 \u2192 (L+B) = (5h)/2. \n\nSo substituting into (L+B)*h =40 \u2192 (5h/2)*h =40 \u2192 (5h\u00b2)/2 =40 \u2192 h\u00b2= (40*2)/5 \u2192 80/5 =16 \u2192 h=4. \n\nSo the height is 4 meters. Looking at the options, option C is 4m. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options given are A)2.6, B)3.9, C)4, D)4.2, E)4.4. So C is correct. \n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Did I miss anything? Let me see. \n\nWait, the semi-perimeter: yes, the problem says \"semi-perimeter\" so that's (L+B). The ratio is height to semi-perimeter 2:5. So yes, that part is correct. \n\nCalculations all check out. So the answer should be C)4m.\n",
