      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have a money pouch with Rs. 700, and the number of 25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee coins are all equal. I need to find how many of each there are. Hmm, so the question is giving me the total amount in rupees, and the coins are in three types with equal counts. Let me think about how to set this up.\n\nFirst, I should remember that 1 rupee is 100 paise. So converting everything to paise might make the calculation easier. Wait, the total is Rs. 700, which is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise. Maybe working in paise is better to avoid dealing with decimals.\n\nLet me denote the number of each type of coin as 'n'. Since they are equal in number, all three will have n coins. \n\nSo the value contributed by each type would be:\n- 25 paise coins: 25 * n paise\n- 50 paise coins: 50 * n paise\n- 1 rupee coins: 100 * n paise (since 1 rupee is 100 paise)\n\nAdding all these together should equal the total in paise, which is 70,000 paise.\n\nSo the equation would be:\n25n + 50n + 100n = 70,000\n\nLet me add those coefficients: 25 + 50 is 75, plus 100 is 175. So 175n = 70,000.\n\nTo find n, divide both sides by 175. Let me calculate that. 70,000 divided by 175. Hmm, maybe simplify this.\n\nLet me see, 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175 * 400. Let me check that: 175 * 400. 175*4 is 700, so times 100 is 70,000. Oh right! So 175*400 = 70,000. Therefore, n=400.\n\nSo the number of each coin is 400. Let me check the options. Option C is 400. So the answer should be C. Wait, let me double-check my math.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculation again. If n is 400, then:\n\n25 *400 = 10,000 paise (which is Rs. 100)\n50 *400 = 20,000 paise (Rs. 200)\n100 *400 = 40,000 paise (Rs. 400)\nAdding those: 100 + 200 + 400 = 700. Exactly. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer must be option C)400. Let me check the options again to make sure I didn't misread. The options given are A)453, B)651, C)400, D)487, E)286. Yep, C is there. So that's the right choice. I think that's solid. No mistakes here.\n",
