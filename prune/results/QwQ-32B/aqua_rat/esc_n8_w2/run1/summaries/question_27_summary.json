      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out how much Rahul has to pay back after 4 years with a simple interest rate of 6% per annum on a Rs. 500 loan. Hmm, let me remember the formula for simple interest. \n\nRight, the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per period, and T is the time in years. Then the total amount to pay back would be the principal plus the interest, so A = P + I, which can also be written as A = P(1 + RT). \n\nLet me plug in the numbers here. The principal (P) is 500 rupees. The rate (R) is 6% per annum. I need to convert that percentage to a decimal, so 6% is 0.06. The time (T) is 4 years. \n\nCalculating the interest first: I = 500 * 0.06 * 4. Let me do that step by step. 500 multiplied by 0.06 is... 500 times 0.06 is 30, right? Because 1% of 500 is 5, so 6% is 30. Then multiply that by 4 years: 30 *4 = 120. So the interest is 120 rupees. \n\nThen the total amount to repay would be the principal plus interest: 500 + 120 = 620. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 620. Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. \n\nWait, 6% of 500 each year is indeed 30. Over four years, 30 *4 is 120. Adding to principal gives 620. So that's correct. The options are A)750, B)700, C)620, D)600, E) None. So the answer should be C. But wait, let me check if the question is asking for the total amount. Yes, \"clear the debt\" so total amount is correct. \n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I misread the question? Let me read again. The question states \"simple interest,\" so yes, the calculation is correct. The options include C as 620, so that's the right answer. Therefore the correct option is C.\n",
