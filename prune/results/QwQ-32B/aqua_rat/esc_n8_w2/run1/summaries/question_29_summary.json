      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so here's the problem: A jeep goes somewhere and takes 6 hours going there. On the way back, it goes 12 km/h faster and takes 4 hours. We need to find the distance. Hmm, right. Let me think.\n\nAlright, the key here is that the distance for the forward and return journeys should be the same, right? Because it's going and coming back. So the distance there equals the distance back. \n\nLet me set up variables. Let's call the speed during the forward journey 'v' km/h. Then the return speed is v + 12 km/h. \n\nThe distance for the forward trip would be speed multiplied by time, so that's v * 6. The return trip's distance is (v + 12) * 4. Since these distances are equal, I can set them equal to each other. \n\nSo, 6v = 4(v + 12). Let me solve that equation. \n\nExpanding the right side: 6v = 4v + 48. Subtract 4v from both sides: 2v = 48. Then divide by 2: v = 24 km/h. \n\nWait, so the forward speed is 24 km/h. Then the distance one way is 24 * 6 = 144 km. Oh, looking at the options, B is 144. But wait, the question asks for the total distance traveled, right? Or is it just one way?\n\nWait, the question says \"What is the distance travelled by the jeep?\" Hmm, that could be ambiguous. But usually, when they say \"distance travelled\" in such problems, they might mean the one-way distance since the return trip covers the same ground. Wait no, actually, sometimes they might consider the total round trip. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe question says, \"the distance travelled by the jeep.\" The jeep went there and came back, so the total distance would be twice the one-way. Wait, but looking at the options, 144 is an option (B) and 288 would not be there. Wait, but let me see the options again. The options given are A)126, B)144, C)127, D)228, E)128. Hmm, so 144 is there. Wait, maybe the question is asking for one-way distance? Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: \"What is the distance travelled by the jeep?\" So the entire journey, going and coming back. So the total distance would be the sum of both trips. Wait, but in that case, if the one-way is 144, then total is 288, which isn't an option. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me go through the steps again. Let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the forward journey: speed v, time 6 hours. So distance is 6v.\n\nReturn journey: speed (v +12), time 4 hours. Distance is 4(v+12). Since the distance is the same, set equal:\n\n6v = 4(v + 12). \n\nSolving:\n\n6v = 4v +48  \n6v -4v =48  \n2v=48  \nv=24 km/h. \n\nSo the one-way distance is 6 *24=144 km. So the total distance would be 144 *2 =288 km, but that's not among the options. Wait, but the options include 144 (B) and D is 228. Hmm. So perhaps I misunderstood the question. Wait maybe the question is asking for one-way distance? Let me check the wording again.\n\nThe question says, \"What is the distance travelled by the jeep?\" The entire journey's total distance would be 144*2=288. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is referring to the one-way distance. Wait, but why would they phrase it that way? The problem says \"the distance travelled by the jeep\" during the journey, which would be the total. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the setup. Let me check again. The forward journey's distance must equal the return journey's distance. Because it's going the same path back. So 6v =4(v+12). That's correct. So solving gives v=24, so each leg is 144. So total distance would be 288, but that's not an option. Wait, but the options given are A to E, with B being 144. So perhaps the question is asking for the one-way distance? Let me read the question again.\n\nOriginal question: \"What is the distance travelled by the jeep?\" The wording is a bit ambiguous. But in typical problems like this, when they mention a journey there and back, the question might be asking for the one-way distance. Because if they wanted the total, they might say \"total distance\". Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me see the options. Let's see: If the answer is 144 (B), that would be one-way. So perhaps the question is asking for the one-way distance. Because the problem says \"the distance travelled by the jeep\" during the journey. Wait, maybe the \"distance\" here refers to the one-way, since the return trip is the same. Hmm. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the distance travelled by the jeep\". The jeep's entire trip is going there and coming back, so total distance is 288. Since that's not an option, maybe I did something wrong. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in solving.\n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the speed and time. Let me check again.\n\nLet me call the distance one way as D. So going: D = v *6. Returning: D = (v +12)*4. Therefore, setting equal: 6v =4(v+12). Which gives v=24. So D is 6*24=144. So the question must be asking for the one-way distance. Because the options have 144 as B, so that's probably the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait the problem says \"the distance travelled by the jeep\". So the entire journey is D going and D returning, so total distance is 2D. But if the options don't have that, then maybe the question is indeed asking for one way. So the answer would be B)144.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is phrased as \"distance travelled\" in the journey, but maybe the question is in the options given, so the answer must be B. Let me check the options again. The options are A)126, B)144, C)127, D)228, E)128. So 144 is there, so probably that's the answer. \n\nWait but why isn't the total distance an option? Maybe the question is intended as one-way. So I'll go with B)144. That's the one-way distance, which is what the problem is asking for. Maybe the wording is a bit ambiguous but given the options, that's the correct one.\n",

Since distance equals speed multiplied by time, the distance for the forward trip is 6v, and the return is 4*(v+12).

So I think the answer is B)144km.\n\n\nThe problem involves a jeep traveling a distance in 6 hours on the forward journey and returning with an increased speed of 12 km/h, taking 4 hours. Since the distance for both legs is the same, we set up the equation using distance = speed \u00d7 time. Let \\( v \\) be the forward speed. The return speed is \\( v + 12 \\). Equating the distances:  \n\\[\n6v = 4(v + 12)\n\\]  \nSolving:  \n\\[\n6v = 4v + 48 \\implies 2v = 48 \\implies v = 24 \\, \\text{km/h}.\n\\]  \nThe one-way distance is \\( 6 \\times 24 = 144 \\) km. Since the options do not include the round-trip distance (288 km), the question must refer to the one-way distance.  \n\nAnswer: B)144km  \n\nAnswer: B",
