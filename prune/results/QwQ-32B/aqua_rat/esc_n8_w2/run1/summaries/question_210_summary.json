      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. Shweta is riding at 10 km per hour, but she stops for 10 minutes every 15 km. I need to figure out how long it takes her to cover 100 km. Hmm, right. So first, maybe I should calculate the time she spends moving and then add the rest stops.\n\nWait, let's break it down. The total distance is 100 km. She stops after every 15 km. So how many stops does she make? Let me think. For every 15 km segment, except maybe the last one if she reaches exactly on a multiple. Let's see. 100 divided by 15 is... 6 and 2/3. So that means she completes 6 full 15 km segments (which would be 90 km) and then has 10 km left. So how many rest stops is that? Well, after each 15 km, so after the first 15, then 30, 45, 60, 75, 90. That's 6 stops. But wait, when she finishes the 100 km, does she take a rest after that? Probably not, since the problem says she stops at the end of every 15 km. So the last 10 km wouldn't have a stop after. So total stops are 6 times 10 minutes each.\n\nNow, the moving time. For the 100 km, how much time does she spend moving? Since her speed is 10 km/h, time is distance divided by speed. So 100 divided by 10 is 10 hours. But that's without the stops. But she does have to add the rest time.\n\nWait, but wait. Wait, maybe I should calculate each segment's time plus the rests. Let me try that approach to be sure.\n\nEach 15 km segment takes how long? At 10 km/h, time is 15/10 = 1.5 hours. Then she stops for 10 minutes. Except after the last segment. Wait, so for the first 15 km: 1.5 hours plus 10 minutes rest. Then next 15, same. But the last segment is 10 km, not 15, so that part's time is 10/10 = 1 hour, and no rest after.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nFirst, how many full 15 km segments are there in 100 km? Let's see 15*6=90, so 6 segments of 15, then the remaining 10. So the total moving time is 6*(15/10) + (10/10) = 6*1.5 +1 = 9 +1 = 10 hours. Then the rest stops: 6 stops (since after each 15 km except the last one which is 10). Each stop is 10 minutes, so 6*10=60 minutes, which is 1 hour. So total time is 10 +1 = 11 hours. Wait, but the options include 11 as option C. Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of stops. Let me think again. Let's list each segment:\n\n1. 15 km: time 1.5h, then rest 10 min.\n2. 15 km: another 1.5h, then rest.\n3. 15 km: same, then rest.\n4. 15 km: then rest.\n5. 15 km: then rest.\n6. 15 km: then rest.\nThen the last 10 km: 1h, no rest.\n\nSo how many rests? After each 15 km segment, so after the first to the sixth segments. So 6 rests. So 6 *10 = 60 minutes. So total time moving is 6 *1.5 +1 = 9 +1 =10 hours, plus 1 hour rest, total 11 hours. That would be option C. But wait, let me check another way. Maybe I should calculate each segment step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nTotal distance: 100 km.\n\nEach 15 km segment:\n\nNumber of segments: 100 /15 = 6.666..., so 6 full segments (90 km) plus 10 km. So the rests are after each 15 km, so after 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90. So 6 rests. So 6*10=60 mins (1 hour).\n\nMoving time: 100 km at 10 km/h is 10 hours. Total time: 10+1=11. So answer C. So the correct answer is C)11 hours.\n\nWait but let me check if the rest after 90 km is counted before the last 10 km. Yes, because after completing each 15 km, she rests. So after 90, which is 6*15, she rests, then does the last 10 km. So the rest is before the final 10 km. So the rests are added after each 15 km, so the total rests are indeed 6. So yes, 11 hours. The options given include C as 11, so that's the answer. Hmm. Let me check the options again. The options are A)9, B)10, C)11, D)12, E)13. So yeah, C is correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about Shweta riding a bike or maybe a bike? Wait, the question says \"rides at the rate of 10 km per hour\". Hmm, probably a bicycle. Anyway, she stops for 10 minutes after every 15 km. We need to find out how long it takes her to cover 100 km.\n\nFirst, I need to calculate the total time she spends moving and the total time she stops. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, her speed is 10 km/h. So without any stops, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. For 100 km, that would be 100/10 = 10 hours. But she stops, so the total time will be more than that.\n\nNow, she stops after every 15 km. Wait, but how many stops does she make? Let's think. Let's see how many 15 km segments there are in 100 km.\n\nDividing 100 by 15 gives... 100 divided by 15 is 6.666... So that's 6 full segments of 15 km, and then a remaining 10 km (since 6*15 is 90, so 100-90=10). \n\nBut the question is, does she take a rest after each 15 km? The problem says \"at the end of every 15 km\". So after every 15 km, she stops for 10 minutes. But the last segment might not require a stop if she reaches the destination.\n\nWait, so for each 15 km segment except the last one, she stops. Let's see:\n\nThe first 15 km: she rides, then stops.\n\nSecond 15 km (total 30): rides, then stops again.\n\nThird 15 km (total 45): stops again.\n\nFourth 15 (60): stops.\n\nFifth (75): stops.\n\nSixth (90): stops.\n\nThen the last 10 km: she doesn't need to stop after that because she's done. So how many stops?\n\nAfter each 15 km except the last part. Since she's doing 6 segments of 15, but the 7th segment is only 10 km. So the number of stops would be 6?\n\nWait, let me count again. Let's see:\n\nAfter first 15 km: stop (1)\nAfter second 15 (total 30): stop (2)\nThird 45: stop (3)\nFourth 60: stop (4)\nFifth 75: stop (5)\nSixth 90: stop (6)\nThen the last 10 km: no stop needed because she's done. So total stops are 6 times. Each stop is 10 minutes, so total stop time is 6*10 = 60 minutes, which is 1 hour.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Suppose she starts, rides 15, stops. Then again 15, etc. So each 15 km segment is followed by a stop except maybe the last one. Since 100 isn't a multiple of 15, the last part is 10 km, so she doesn't stop after that. So yes, 6 stops.\n\nNow, the moving time: Each 15 km takes time. Since she's moving at 10 km/h, time per 15 km is 15/10 = 1.5 hours. So for each 15 km segment, 1.5 hours. How many such segments are there?\n\nWell, there are 6 segments of 15 km (total 90 km) and one segment of 10 km. \n\nSo the total moving time is (6 * 1.5) + (10/10). Let's calculate that:\n\n6 * 1.5 is 9 hours, plus 1 hour (for the last 10 km) gives 10 hours of moving time. Then the stops add 1 hour. Total time 11 hours? Wait, that's 10 + 1 = 11. So the answer would be C) 11 hours?\n\nWait, let me check again. Wait, the stops are 6 times, each 10 minutes. 6*10 is 60 minutes, so 1 hour. So moving time 10 hours plus 1 hour = 11 hours total. That seems right.\n\nWait but let me think again step by step. Let's break down each segment:\n\nFirst 15 km: 1.5 hours riding, then 10 minutes stop.\n\nSecond 15: another 1.5 hours and 10 minutes stop.\n\nThird same. Up to the sixth 15 km (total 90 km). Then the last 10 km.\n\nSo the stops happen after each 15 km. So after each of the 6 segments (each 15 km), so 6 stops. So the total stops are 6 * 10 = 60 minutes. \n\nThe moving time for the 6 segments of 15 km is 6 * 1.5 = 9 hours. The last 10 km takes 1 hour. So 9 +1 = 10 hours. So total time is 10 +1 =11. That's option C. \n\nHmm. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here. Like, maybe the last segment's time is included correctly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of stops. Let's see:\n\nSuppose she starts at 0 km. After 15, stop. Then 30, stop, 45, 60, 75, 90, then 100. So after each 15 km, except the last one. So when she reaches 90, she stops again, then goes to 100. So the stops after 15, 30,...,90. That's 6 stops. So yes, 6 stops. \n\nAlternatively, someone might think that after the last 15 km (the 90 km point), she still stops, but since she needs to go another 10 km, she doesn't need to stop again. So the stops are indeed 6. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could think that after 100 km, she would have to stop, but since she's done, so that's not counted. \n\nSo the calculation seems correct. So the total time is 11 hours. So the answer is C.\n",
