      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the actual selling price of the article that Vinit bought during the sale. Let me read the question again. The problem states that there's a 20% discount on all items, and Vinit paid 4578 rupees. The question is asking for the actual selling price before the discount, right?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the term \"actual selling price\" might be a bit confusing. Because usually, the selling price after discount is considered the final price the customer pays. But maybe here, the actual selling price refers to the original price before the discount. Because the discount is applied to the original price, so the original price would be the actual one, and the sale price is the discounted one. So the question is probably asking for the original price before the 20% discount.\n\nSo the formula here would be: the sale price is equal to the original price minus 20% of it. So, if the original price is let's say X, then after a 20% discount, the price becomes X - 0.2X = 0.8X. And that's equal to what Vinit paid, which is 4578. So 0.8X = 4578. To find X, we can divide 4578 by 0.8.\n\nLet me calculate that. 4578 divided by 0.8. Hmm, let's see. Dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 1.25. So 4578 * 1.25. Let's do that step by step. \n\nFirst, 4578 * 1 = 4578. Then 4578 * 0.25 is a quarter of 4578. Let's compute a quarter of 4578: 4578 divided by 4. 4578 divided by 4 is 1144.5. So adding those together, 4578 + 1144.5 equals 5722.5. Wait, but that would be 4578 *1.25=5722.5. Hmm, but looking at the options, option B is 5723, which is probably rounded. So that would be the original price before discount. \n\nBut wait, the options given are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. So B is 5723, which is close to the 5722.5 I got. That must be the answer. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:\n\n4578 divided by 0.8. Let's do it another way. 4578 divided by 0.8. Let's see, 0.8 times 5000 is 4000. So 5000 would give 4000 after 20% discount. But 4578 is more than 4000, so the original price must be higher than 5000. Let's see, 5000 *0.8 is 4000. So each 100 more in the original price would add 80 to the sale price. The difference between 4578 and 4000 is 578. So 578 divided by 0.8 (since each 1 unit of original adds 0.8 to sale price). Wait, perhaps that's complicating. Alternatively, maybe better to do straight division.\n\n4578 divided by 0.8. Let's do 4578 / 0.8:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal: 45780 / 8. Now, 45780 divided by 8. Let's compute that.\n\n8 \u00d7 5000 is 40,000. Subtract that from 45,780: 45,780 - 40,000 = 5,780. Now, 8 \u00d7 700 = 5,600. So 5000 + 700 = 5700. That leaves 5,780 - 5,600 = 180. Then 8 \u00d722.5 = 180. So total is 5700 +22.5=5722.5. Exactly. So 5722.5, which rounds to 5723, so option B is correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options include B as 5723, so that must be the answer. Let me see if any other options could be possible. Let me check if perhaps I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait the question says \"actual selling price\". Hmm. Wait, maybe there's confusion between the terms. Let me think again. The original price is often called the marked price. The selling price after discount is what the customer pays. So perhaps the question is phrased as \"actual selling price\" meaning the original selling price before discount. Because the discounted price is the actual amount paid, but maybe the term here is that the \"actual\" refers to the original.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is worded in a tricky way. Let me read again:\n\n\"discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nWait, maybe the term \"actual selling price\" is the price after discount. Wait no, that wouldn't make sense. Because the actual selling price would be the one he paid. But the question is probably using \"actual\" to mean the original price. Maybe the wording is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps in some contexts, the actual selling price is the price after discount. Wait, that would mean that the answer is 4578, but that's not an option. So probably, the question is using \"actual\" as the original price, so the answer is B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see the options again. The options are A to E, with B being 5723. So I think that's correct. The calculation checks out. So the answer must be B.\n",

Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 during the sale, and we need to find the actual selling price before the discount. Wait, wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, the question says \"actual selling price\"? Or maybe I need to clarify.

Let me make sure I understand the terms here.\n\nSo the problem states that the discount is 20% on all articles. Vinit purchased it for 4578. So the 4578 is the price after the 20% discount. The question is asking for the actual selling price. Wait, but sometimes \"actual selling price\" could be confusing. Maybe the term here is that the original price (the marked price) is what's being asked? Because the selling price after discount would be 4578, which is the amount he paid. So perhaps the question is phrased in a way where the \"actual selling price\" is the original price before discount. Because otherwise, if the selling price is the one he paid, then the answer would just be 4578, which isn't an option here. So that must not be the case.\n\nSo I think the question is phrased such that the actual selling price refers to the original price before the discount. So the process is, the original price (let's call it M) was discounted by 20%, so the sale price is 80% of M. And that equals 4578. So we can set up the equation: 0.8 * M = 4578. Then solving for M would give the original price, which is the answer here.\n\nLet me check the options again. The options are A to E, with numbers like 5050, 5723, etc. Let me calculate M.

So the original price is 5722.5, which rounds to 5723, so option B.\n\nWait, but the options are in whole numbers. The question might have exact numbers.
