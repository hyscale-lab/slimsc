      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where Mark and John are talking about money. Hmm, the question is asking how much money John originally had. The options are given, so maybe I can set up some equations here.\n\nFirst, let me parse the statements carefully. \n\nMark told John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So that's Mark's statement. Let me denote the variables first. Let me say that John has J rupees and Mark has M rupees initially. \n\nSo according to Mark's statement: If John gives half his money to Mark, then Mark's total becomes 75. So, the equation would be: Mark's money plus half of John's money equals 75. \n\nWait, yes. So, after the transaction, Mark would have his original amount M plus (J/2). And that sum equals 75. So equation 1: M + (J/2) = 75.\n\nThen John says, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So this is John's counter. So in this scenario, Mark gives John one third of his (Mark's) money. Then John's total becomes 75. \n\nSo John's original money J plus (1/3 of Mark's money) equals 75. But wait, when Mark gives away a third of his money, his own money decreases, but the problem is only about John's total here. So the equation would be J + (M/3) =75. That's equation 2: J + (M/3) =75.\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. Let me write them down again:\n\n1. M + (J/2) = 75\n\n2. J + (M/3) =75\n\nNow I need to solve these two equations for J and M. Let me see how to do that. Maybe substitution or elimination. Let me try substitution.\n\nLet me solve equation 1 for M first. From equation 1:\n\nM = 75 - (J/2)\n\nThen plug this into equation 2. \n\nEquation 2 becomes: J + [ (75 - (J/2) ) / 3 ] = 75 \n\nHmm, let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, substitute M into the second equation's M/3 part. So:\n\nJ + (1/3)*(75 - (J/2)) = 75\n\nLet me compute the terms. Let me expand the terms inside:\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nJ + [ (75/3) - ( (J/2)/3 ) ] =75\n\nSimplify each part. 75 divided by 3 is 25. Then (J/2)/3 is J/(6). So:\n\nJ + 25 - (J/6) =75\n\nNow combine like terms. Let me get all terms involving J on the left and constants on the right. Wait, maybe first combine the J terms. \n\nSo J - (J/6) is the same as (6J/6 - J/6) = (5J)/6. \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n(5J)/6 +25 =75\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n(5J)/6 = 50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J = 300\n\nDivide by 5:\n\nJ=60\n\nWait, so John has 60? But let me check the options. The options include B)60, which would be the answer? Wait, but let me verify with the equations again. Let me check my steps again because sometimes substitution can have errors.\n\nWait, let me check with the first equation. If J is 60, then M would be 75 - (60/2) =75-30=45. So Mark has 45. \n\nThen let's check the second equation. John's money plus 1/3 of Mark's money: 60 + (45/3) =60 +15=75. That works. \n\nBut wait, let's check the first scenario. If John gives half his money (half of 60 is 30) to Mark, then Mark would have 45+30=75, which matches. So both equations are satisfied. \n\nHmm, but the options include B)60. So why is this not the answer? Wait but the question is asking how much money John had. So the answer would be 60, which is option B. But wait, looking back at the options given, the options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18. So B is an option. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check again because sometimes I might have miscalculated. Let me re-examine the equations again. \n\nWait, in the first equation, M + (J/2)=75. If John gives half his money to Mark, then yes. So Mark's money plus half of John's money equals 75. \n\nSecond equation: when Mark gives a third of his money to John. Then John's total is his own plus a third of Mark's. \n\nSo with J=60 and M=45, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so then the answer should be B)60. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me read the problem again to confirm.\n\nMark says, \"If you give me half your money, I'll have 75.\" So yes, that's M + (J/2) =75.\n\nJohn says, \"If you give me a third of your money, I'll have 75.\" So John's money plus (M/3) equals 75. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the calculations are correct. So the answer is B. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18. So B is there. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra steps. Let me go through the equations again. \n\nStarting with equation 1: M =75 - J/2. \n\nThen plug into equation 2: J + (M/3) =75.\n\nSubstituting M:\n\nJ + ( (75 - J/2)/3 ) =75.\n\nMultiply out the terms:\n\nLet me write (75 - J/2) divided by 3 as (75/3) - (J/2)/3 =25 - J/(6). \n\nSo J + 25 - J/6 =75.\n\nCombine J terms: J - J/6 = (5/6)J. \n\nSo 5/6 J +25=75 \u2192 5/6 J =50 \u2192 J=50*(6/5)=60. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer is B)60. But wait, the problem says \"how much money did John have?\" So that's correct. So why do I have a feeling that maybe I missed something? Let me see if any of the other options could fit. \n\nWait, let's test another option. Suppose if the answer was 22, then J=22. Then from equation 1, M would be 75 -11=64. Then equation 2: 22 + (64/3) = 22 +21.333...=43.333 which isn't 75. So no. \n\nIf John had 28 (option C), then M would be 75 -14=61. Then John's equation would be 28 +61/3 \u224828+20.33=48.33, no. \n\nOption D: 26. Then M=75 -13=62. Then John's equation:26 +62/3\u224826+20.666=46.666, nope. \n\nE)18: M=75-9=66. Then John's equation:18 +22=40, no. \n\nSo only B works. \n\nHmm, so the answer must be B. But let me check again. The problem says \"John said, 'if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-.\" So that's exactly what equation 2 is. \n\nYes, so I think I did it right. So the answer is B)60.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so here's this problem between Mark and John. Let me see. The question is asking how much money John had originally. Hmm, the problem gives two different scenarios where they exchange money in different ways and end up with certain amounts. I need to set up equations for both statements and solve them. Let me try to parse each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the variables. Let me let J be the amount of money John has, and M be the amount Mark has. That makes sense.\n\nThe first statement is from Mark: \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, if John gives half his money to Mark, then Mark's total becomes 75. Let's break that down. Half of John's money is (1/2)J. So after the transfer, Mark's money would be his original M plus (1/2)J. And that equals 75. So equation one would be:\n\nM + (1/2)J = 75.\n\nThen John responds: \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So here, Mark is giving John one third of his own money. So Mark gives (1/3)M to John. Then John's total becomes his original J plus (1/3)M, and that sum is 75. So the second equation is:\n\nJ + (1/3)M = 75.\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables. Let me write them again:\n\n1) M + (J/2) = 75\n\n2) J + (M/3) = 75\n\nNow I need to solve these equations. Let me see. Maybe substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.\n\nLet me solve the first equation for M perhaps. From equation 1:\n\nM = 75 - (J/2)\n\nThen plug this expression for M into equation 2.\n\nSo equation 2 becomes:\n\nJ + ( (75 - (J/2)) / 3 ) = 75\n\nHmm, let me compute that step by step. Let me write that again:\n\nJ + [ (75 - (J/2) ) / 3 ] = 75\n\nLet me simplify the terms inside the brackets. Let me compute the numerator first. 75 minus (J/2) divided by 3. Let's see. Maybe to make this easier, multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominators. Alternatively, let me compute step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let me multiply the entire equation by 3 to eliminate denominators. Let's try that approach. Multiply both sides by 3:\n\n3*J + (75 - (J/2)) = 3*75\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3J + 75 - (J/2) = 225\n\nNow combine like terms. Let's get all the J terms on one side.\n\nFirst, let's subtract 75 from both sides:\n\n3J - (J/2) = 225 - 75\n\nWhich is 3J - 0.5J = 150\n\nCalculating 3J minus 0.5J is 2.5J. So:\n\n2.5J = 150\n\nTo solve for J, divide both sides by 2.5:\n\nJ = 150 / 2.5\n\nHmm, 150 divided by 2.5. Let me compute that. 2.5 goes into 150 how many times? Well, 2.5 times 60 is 150, because 2.5*60 = 150. So J = 60. Wait, but let me check that again. Because 2.5*60 is indeed 150. So J is 60?\n\nBut wait, the options include 60 as option B. But let me check if that makes sense. Let me verify with the original equations.\n\nIf John had 60, then according to equation 1:\n\nM + (60/2) = 75 \u2192 M +30 =75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45. Now check the second equation:\n\nJohn's money after receiving 1/3 of Mark's money. 1/3 of 45 is 15. So John would have 60 +15=75, which matches. So that works.\n\nWait but hold on, the options have B as 60, which would be John's money, so that's the answer? But let me check the options again. The question is asking how much money John had. So yes, 60 would be the answer, which is option B. But wait, wait a second. Let me check again because sometimes I might have messed up the equations.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first equation. The first statement was Mark telling John: If you give me half your money, I'll have 75. So if John gives half his money (which is J/2) to Mark, then Mark's total is M + J/2 =75. That's correct. \n\nSecond equation: If Mark gives John one third of his (Mark's) money. So Mark gives (1/3)M to John. So John then has J + (1/3)M =75. That's correct.\n\nSo solving gives J=60 and M=45. So John had 60. So the answer is B. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 60. But let me check again with the problem. Wait the options given are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18. So B is an option, so that's correct. Hmm, but let me think again because sometimes there might be a trick.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the algebra. Let me go through the equations again. Let me re-solve them step by step.\n\nFirst equation: M + (J/2) =75 \u2192 M =75 - (J/2)\n\nSecond equation: J + (M/3) =75\n\nSubstitute M from first into second equation:\n\nJ + ( (75 - (J/2) ) /3 ) =75\n\nLet me compute the term (75 - J/2)/3. Let me write that as (75/3) - (J/2)/3 \u2192 25 - J/(6). So the equation becomes J +25 - (J/6) =75.\n\nCombine terms:\n\nJ - (J/6) = (6J - J)/6 = (5J)/6. So (5J/6) +25 =75.\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides: (5J/6) =50 \u2192 5J = 300 \u2192 J=60. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the answer should be B)60. But wait, the options given include B as 60. So that's the correct answer. Wait, but maybe I misread the problem? Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: \"How much money did John have?\" So yes, that's J. So 60 is correct. Therefore, the answer is B.\n\nWait, but I thought sometimes in these problems the answer might be different. Let me try plugging in another option to see. Let's say, option E is 18. Let's see if that works. Suppose John had 18. Then from first equation, M +9 =75 \u2192 M=66. Then second equation: J + (66/3) =18 +22 =40, which is not 75. So that's wrong.\n\nAnother option: let's try option D, 26. Then first equation M +13 =75 \u2192 M=62. Then second equation: 26 + (62/3) \u2192 26 + ~20.666 = ~46.666, not 75. Nope.\n\nOption C is 28. Then M would be 75-14=61. Then 28 + 61/3 \u224828 +20.333=48.333, nope.\n\nOption A:22. Then M is 75-11=64. Then 22 + 64/3 \u224822+21.333=43.333, not 75.\n\nSo only B gives the correct answer. Therefore, I think the answer is B)60.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so here's this problem between Mark and John. Let me see. The question is asking how much money John had originally. Hmm, the problem gives two different scenarios where they exchange money in different ways and end up with certain amounts. I need to set up equations for both statements and solve them. Let me try to parse each part step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the variables. Let me let J be the amount of money John has, and M be the amount Mark has. That makes sense.\n\nThe first statement is from Mark: \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So, if John gives half his money to Mark, then Mark's total becomes 75. Let's break that down. Half of John's money is (1/2)J. So after the transfer, Mark's money would be his original M plus (1/2)J. And that equals 75. So equation one would be:\n\nM + (1/2)J = 75.\n\nThen John responds: \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So here, Mark is giving John one third of his own money. So Mark gives (1/3)M to John. Then John's total becomes his original J plus (1/3)M, and that sum is 75. So the second equation is:\n\nJ + (1/3)M = 75.\n\nNow, I have two equations with two variables. Let me write them again:\n\n1) M + (J/2) = 75\n\n2) J + (M/3) = 75\n\nNow I need to solve these equations. Let me see. Maybe substitution or elimination. Let's try substitution.\n\nLet me solve the first equation for M perhaps. From equation 1:\n\nM = 75 - (J/2)\n\nThen plug this expression for M into equation 2.\n\nSo equation 2 becomes:\n\nJ + ( (75 - (J/2)) / 3 ) = 75\n\nHmm, let me compute that step by step. Let me write that again:\n\nJ + [ (75 - (J/2) ) / 3 ] = 75\n\nLet me simplify the terms inside the brackets. Let me compute the numerator first. 75 minus (J/2) divided by 3. Let's see. Maybe to make this easier, multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate denominators. Alternatively, let me compute step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let me multiply the entire equation by 3 to eliminate denominators. Let's try that approach. Multiply both sides by 3:\n\n3*J + (75 - (J/2)) = 3*75\n\nCalculating that:\n\n3J + 75 - (J/2) = 225\n\nNow combine like terms. Let's get all the J terms on one side.\n\nFirst, let's subtract 75 from both sides:\n\n3J - (J/2) = 225 - 75\n\nWhich is 3J - 0.5J = 150\n\nCalculating 3J minus 0.5J is 2.5J. So:\n\n2.5J = 150\n\nTo solve for J, divide both sides by 2.5:\n\nJ = 150 / 2.5\n\nHmm, 150 divided by 2.5. Let me compute that. 2.5 goes into 150 how many times? Well, 2.5 times 60 is 150, because 2.5*60 = 150. So J = 60. Wait, but let me check that again. Because 2.5*60 is indeed 150. So J is 60?\n\nBut wait, the options include 60 as option B. But let me check if that makes sense. Let me verify with the original equations.\n\nIf John had 60, then according to equation 1:\n\nM + (60/2) = 75 \u2192 M +30 =75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nSo Mark has 45. Now check the second equation:\n\nJohn's money after receiving 1/3 of Mark's money. 1/3 of 45 is 15. So John would have 60 +15=75, which matches. So that works.\n\nWait but hold on, the options have B as 60, which would be John's money, so that's the answer? But let me check the options again. The question is asking how much money John had. So yes, 60 would be the answer, which is option B. But wait, wait a second. Let me check again because sometimes I might have messed up the equations.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the first equation. The first statement was Mark telling John: If you give me half your money, I'll have 75. So if John gives half his money (which is J/2) to Mark, then Mark's total is M + J/2 =75. That's correct. \n\nSecond equation: If Mark gives John one third of his (Mark's) money. So Mark gives (1/3)M to John. So John then has J + (1/3)M =75. That's correct.\n\nSo solving gives J=60 and M=45. So John had 60. So the answer is B. But wait, looking at the options, option B is 60. But let me check again with the problem. Wait the options given are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18. So B is an option, so that's correct. Hmm, but let me think again because sometimes there might be a trick.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the algebra. Let me go through the equations again. Let me re-solve them step by step.\n\nFirst equation: M + (J/2) =75 \u2192 M =75 - (J/2)\n\nSecond equation: J + (M/3) =75\n\nSubstitute M from first into second equation:\n\nJ + ( (75 - (J/2) ) /3 ) =75\n\nLet me compute the term (75 - J/2)/3. Let me write that as (75/3) - (J/2)/3 \u2192 25 - J/(6). So the equation becomes J +25 - (J/6) =75.\n\nCombine terms:\n\nJ - (J/6) = (6J - J)/6 = (5J)/6. So (5J/6) +25 =75.\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides: (5J/6) =50 \u2192 5J = 300 \u2192 J=60. Yep, same result. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the answer should be B)60. But wait, the options given include B as 60. So that's the correct answer. Wait, but maybe I misread the problem? Let me read again.\n\nThe problem says: \"How much money did John have?\" So yes, that's J. So 60 is correct. Therefore, the answer is B.\n\nWait, but I thought sometimes in these problems the answer might be different. Let me try plugging in another option to see. Let's say, option E is 18. Let's see if that works. Suppose John had 18. Then from first equation, M +9 =75 \u2192 M=66. Then second equation: J + (66/3) =18 +22 =40, which is not 75. So that's wrong.\n\nAnother option: let's try option D, 26. Then first equation M +13 =75 \u2192 M=62. Then second equation: 26 + (62/3) \u2192 26 + ~20.666 = ~46.666, not 75. Nope.\n\nOption C is 28. Then M would be 75-14=61. Then 28 + 61/3 \u224828 +20.333=48.333, nope.\n\nOption A:22. Then M is 75-11=64. Then 22 + 64/3 \u224822+21.333=43.333, not 75.\n\nSo only B gives the correct answer. Therefore, I think the answer is B)60.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote John's money as \\( J \\) and Mark's money as \\( M \\). We set up two equations based on the given conditions:\n\n1. **Mark's statement**: If John gives half his money to Mark, Mark will have Rs. 75.\n   \\[\n   M + \\frac{J}{2} = 75 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)}\n   \\]\n2. **John's statement**: If Mark gives one-third of his money to John, John will have Rs. 75.\n   \\[\n   J + \\frac{M}{3} = 75 \\quad \\text{(Equation 2)}\n   \\]\n\n**Solving the equations**:\n\nFrom Equation 1, solve for \\( M \\):\n\\[\nM = 75 - \\frac{J}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute this expression for \\( M \\) into Equation 2:\n\\[\nJ + \\frac{75 - \\frac{J}{2}}{3} = 75\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 3 to eliminate the denominator:\n\\[\n3J + 75 - \\frac{J}{2} = 225\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{5J}{2} = 150 \\implies J = \\frac{150 \\times 2}{5} = 60\n\\]\n\n**Verification**:\n- If \\( J = 60 \\), then from Equation 1, \\( M = 75 - 30 = 45 \\).\n- Check Equation 2: \\( 60 + \\frac{45}{3} = 60 + 15 = 75 \\), which holds true.\n\nThus, John originally had **Rs. 60**, corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
