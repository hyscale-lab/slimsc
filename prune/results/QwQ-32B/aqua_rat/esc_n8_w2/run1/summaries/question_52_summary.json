      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the question is about a man who spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12.5% of his income. We need to find his monthly income. The options are given, so maybe I can work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what's given. He saves 12.5% of his income, which means the rest he spends. So if his total income is, say, X rupees, then 12.5% of X is his savings, and the remaining 87.5% (since 100% - 12.5% = 87.5%) is what he spends. Wait, because the problem says he spends 3500, right? So that 87.5% of his income equals 3500. \n\nLet me write that down as an equation. Let his income be X. Then:\n\nSavings percentage = 12.5%, so the amount saved is (12.5/100)*X. \n\nThe amount he spends would be total income minus savings: X - (12.5/100)*X. Alternatively, that's the same as (100% - 12.5%) of X, which is 87.5% of X. \n\nSince the problem states he spends 3500, so 87.5% of X equals 3500. \n\nSo, 87.5% of X = 3500. \n\nTo find X, we can write this as:\n\n0.875 * X = 3500\n\nSo, solving for X: X = 3500 / 0.875\n\nHmm, I need to compute that. Let me do the division. \n\nAlternatively, maybe convert 87.5% to a fraction. 87.5% is the same as 7/8, because 87.5/100 = 7/8. Let me confirm that. 7 divided by 8 is 0.875, yes. So 7/8 of X is 3500. \n\nTherefore, X = 3500 * (8/7) \n\nCalculating that: 3500 divided by 7 is 500. 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000. \n\nWait, so X would be 4000. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, 3500 divided by 0.875. Let's do this division:\n\n0.875 is the same as 7/8, so dividing by 7/8 is multiplying by 8/7. \n\n3500 multiplied by 8 equals 28,000. Then divided by 7: 28,000 /7 is 4000. \n\nYes, so the income is 4000. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 4000. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me see. Suppose his income is 4000. 12.5% of 4000 is 500. So he saves 500, and spends 3500. Which matches exactly the problem statement. So that's correct. \n\nSo the correct answer is C) Rs. 4000. \n\nThe options include E) None of these, but since C is correct, E isn't needed. So the answer must be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about a man who spends Rs. 3500 each month and saves 12.5% of his income. We need to find his total monthly income. Hmm, let me think how to approach this.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. If he saves 12.5% of his income, that means the amount he spends must be the remaining percentage of his income. Since 100% is the total income, subtracting the savings percentage gives the spending percentage. So 100% - 12.5% equals 87.5% of his income is spent. \n\nWait, right. So the amount he spends, which is Rs. 3500, corresponds to 87.5% of his total income. The question is then, what's the total income when 87.5% of it is 3500?\n\nLet me set up an equation here. Let's let his total income be 'x' rupees. Then 87.5% of x equals 3500. So:\n\n0.875 * x = 3500\n\nTo find x, I need to divide 3500 by 0.875. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 0.875 is the same as 7/8, right? Because 1/8 is 0.125, so 7/8 is 0.875. Oh, that's easier. So if I rewrite the equation:\n\n(7/8) * x = 3500\n\nThen solving for x would be multiplying both sides by 8/7. \n\nx = 3500 * (8/7)\n\nLet me compute that. 3500 divided by 7 is 500. Then 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000. Oh, so x is 4000. \n\nWait a second, that would mean his total income is Rs. 4000. Let me check the options. Option C is 4000. So that's the answer?\n\nBut hold on, let me verify again. Let's see, if his income is 4000, 12.5% of that is 500 (since 10% is 400, 2.5% is 100, so total 500). So he saves 500, and spends 4000 - 500 = 3500. Which matches the given spending. So that checks out. \n\nSo the correct answer should be option C) Rs.4000. Let me look at the options again to make sure. The options are A)4400, B)4270, C)4000, D)3937.50, E)None. Since 4000 is there as option C, the answer is C. \n\nWait, but why is option D there? Maybe I made a mistake in calculation? Let me recalculate. Let's do the division 3500 divided by 0.875. \n\nAlternatively, 0.875 is 7/8, so 3500 divided by 7/8 is 3500 * 8/7. Let me compute that again:\n\n3500 divided by 7 is indeed 500. 500 *8 is 4000. So no mistake. So D's value is 3937.50, which might be a common wrong calculation. Like if someone thought 12.5% is the amount spent instead of saved? Let's see. Wait, if someone thought he saved 12.5 and spent the rest, but perhaps miscalculated the percentage? Maybe they thought 12.5% is the spending. But the problem says he saves 12.5%, so spending is 87.5%. So no, the correct calculation is 3500/(7/8) =4000. So yes, C is correct. Therefore the answer is C.\n",
