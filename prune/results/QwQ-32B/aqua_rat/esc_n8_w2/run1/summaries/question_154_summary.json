      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so there's this problem about two ants and their shadows. Let me try to figure this out. Hmm, the question says they're standing side-by-side, so I guess the sun is casting shadows in the same direction for both. The first ant is 4 inches tall and its shadow is 10 inches long. The second ant is taller, 6 inches, and we need to find the length of its shadow. \n\nI remember that when objects are next to each other and the light source is the same, like the sun, the ratios of their heights to their shadow lengths should be the same. Oh right, similar triangles! Because the sun's rays are parallel, the triangles formed by the ants and their shadows are similar. So the ratio of height to shadow length should be equal for both ants.\n\nLet me write that down. Let's call the height of the first ant h1 = 4 inches, and its shadow s1 = 10 inches. The second ant is h2 =6 inches, and we need to find s2. The ratio h1/s1 should equal h2/s2. Wait, or is it the other way around? Wait, no, the ratio of height to shadow length would be the same because the angle of the sun is the same. So h1 divided by s1 equals h2 divided by s2. \n\nSo setting up the equation: 4 / 10 = 6 / s2. Then I can cross-multiply to solve for s2. \n\nCross-multiplying gives 4 * s2 = 10 *6. So 4s2 =60. Then divide both sides by 4, so s2 =60/4 =15. Wait, that gives 15. But let me check again. Wait, maybe I mixed up the ratio. Wait, maybe it's the shadow length proportional to the height. Since the taller ant is 1.5 times taller (6 is 1.5x 4), then the shadow should also be 1.5 times longer. The original shadow is 10, so 10 *1.5 is 15. That matches. So the answer would be D)15. \n\nWait but let me make sure I didn't flip the ratio. Suppose the ratio is height over shadow, so 4/10 =6/s2. Solving for s2 gives (10*6)/4 =60/4=15. Yes, that's correct. Alternatively, if it was shadow over height, then 10/4 = s2/6, which would also give s2 = (10/4)*6 =15. Either way, same result. So yeah, the answer must be D.\n",
