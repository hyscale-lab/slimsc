      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about figuring out Meenu's weight based on her statement. So, Silu says she weighs 51 kgs, but that's probably just a given and maybe a distraction. The real question is Meenu's weight. \n\nMeenu says, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing at first. Let me parse that sentence again. She's saying her total weight is equal to 29 plus half of her own weight. Wait, that seems like an equation we can set up. \n\nLet me denote Meenu's weight as, let's say, M. So according to her statement: M = 29 + (1/2)*M. Oh right, because half of her weight is (1/2)M. So the equation is M equals 29 plus half of M. \n\nNow I need to solve for M. Let's subtract half of M from both sides to get all the M terms on one side. So M minus (1/2)M equals 29. That simplifies to (1/2)M = 29. Then, multiplying both sides by 2 gives M = 58. Wait, but 58 is one of the options, option D. \n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. If Meenu's weight is 58, then half of that is 29. Adding 29 (the given number) plus 29 (half her weight) would give 58, which matches her total weight. So that works. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 58. Let me check the other options just in case. Let's try option E, 91. Half of 91 is 45.5. 29 +45.5 is 74.5, which is not 91. So that's wrong. Option C is 27. Half of 27 is 13.5, plus 29 would be 42.5, not 27. So no. Option B, 28: half is 14, plus 29 is 43. Not 28. Option A, 12: half is 6, plus 29 is 35, which isn't 12. So yeah, D must be correct. \n\nI think that's it. The answer is D)58.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. So the problem is about figuring out Meenu's weight based on her statement. Hmm. Silu says she's 51 kgs, but that might not be directly relevant. The key part is what Meenu says. She says, \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\n\nMeenu's statement is: \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" So, if I let her weight be some variable, like M, then according to her, M equals 29 plus half of M. Let me write that equation out. \n\nSo M = 29 + (1/2)*M. Hmm, solving for M here. To solve this equation, I can subtract half of M from both sides. That would give M - (1/2)M = 29. That simplifies to (1/2)M = 29. Then multiplying both sides by 2 would give M = 58. Wait, so that would make Meenu's weight 58 kgs? Let me check the options. Option D is 58, so that's a possibility. \n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the problem. The way she phrased it is \"29 plus half of my weight.\" So if her total weight is 58, then half of her weight would be 29. So 29 plus 29 equals 58. That adds up correctly. Oh right, that makes sense. Because if you take half of her weight (which would be 29) and add that to 29, you get 58. So that works out. \n\nHmm, but let me think again. Sometimes these problems can be tricky. Suppose someone says, \"I weigh X plus half my weight,\" then solving that equation would always lead to X being half their weight. Because the equation is M = X + (M/2). So rearranged, M - M/2 = X \u2192 M/2 = X \u2192 M=2X. So in this case, X is 29, so M would be 58. Yep, that's exactly what's happening here. \n\nLooking at the options again: D is 58. So that's the answer. The other options don't fit. Let's check another option just to be safe. Suppose someone thought maybe the equation was different. Like maybe 29 plus half of Silu's weight? But the problem states that Meenu is referring to her own weight. So no, that's not the case. The key is that the half is of her own weight. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might miscalculate and think 29 plus half of 29, but that would be 29 +14.5=43.5, which isn't an option. So that's not it. The correct setup is crucial here. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be D)58.\n",
