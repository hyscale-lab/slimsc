      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out the percentage more the appliance was sold for compared to its wholesale cost. Hmm, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. Let me assign variables here. Let's say the wholesale cost is W. Then the original retail price would be W plus 60% of W. So that would be W * 1.6, right? Because 60% more means multiplying by 1.6. \n\nThen, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So the selling price is 80% of the original retail price. Let me write that down. If the original retail is 1.6W, then 20% off would be 0.8 times that. So 0.8 * 1.6W. Let me compute that. 0.8 multiplied by 1.6... Hmm, 1.6 times 0.8. Let's see, 1.6 times 0.8 is 1.28. Oh, right because 1.6*0.8 = (1 + 0.6)*0.8 = 0.8 + 0.48 = 1.28. \n\nSo the selling price is 1.28 times the wholesale cost. Which means compared to the wholesale cost, the selling price is 28% more. Wait, because 1.28 is 128% of W, so that's 28% above the wholesale. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 28%, so that's the answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nOriginal price is 1.6 times W. Then sold at 20% less: so 80% of 1.6W. So yes, 0.8*1.6 is indeed 1.28. So 1.28W is the selling price, so that's 28% more than W. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a different way to approach it. Suppose the wholesale cost is, say, $100. Let me pick a number to make it concrete. Let's try that. \n\nIf W is $100, then original retail price is 60% more, so 100 + 60 = $160. Then sold for 20% less than that. 20% of 160 is 32, so subtracting that gives 160 - 32 = $128. So the selling price is $128. \n\nComparing to the wholesale cost of $100, the selling price is 128, which is 28% more. Yep, that matches. So the answer is B)28%. \n\nHmm, I think that's solid. The steps check out both algebraically and with numbers. I don't see any mistakes here. The key is to compute the two percentages step by step and not mix them up. Like, it's not 60% - 20%, which would be 40%, but that's not how percentages work. Instead, you have to apply each percentage in sequence. So yeah, the correct answer should be B.\n",

Let me read it again carefully.\n\nThe original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. Then the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So, they want to know what percent more than the wholesale cost it was sold for. \n\nAlright, maybe I should start by assigning variables to make this clearer. Let me let the wholesale cost be some number. Maybe using $100 as the wholesale cost would make the percentages easier to calculate. Let me try that.\n\nLet's say the wholesale cost (WC) is $100. Then the original retail price (ORP) is 60% more than that. So 60% of 100 is 60, so ORP would be 100 + 60 = $160. \n\nNow, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So 20% off of $160. Let's calculate that discount. 20% of 160 is 32, so the sale price (SP) is 160 - 32 = $128. \n\nSo the selling price is $128, and the wholesale cost was $100. The question is asking what percent more than the wholesale cost this selling price is. \n\nTo find the percentage increase from wholesale to selling price, the formula is [(SP - WC)/WC] * 100%. \n\nPlugging in the numbers: (128 - 100)/100 * 100% = 28/100 * 100% = 28%. \n\nWait, so that's 28% more than the wholesale cost. Let me check the options. Option B is 28%, so that might be the answer. \n\nBut let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me go through again. \n\nOriginal retail price is 60% over wholesale. So 100 + 60% of 100 = 160. Then sold at 20% less than that. 20% of 160 is 32, so subtract that gives 128. 128 compared to 100 is indeed 28% increase. \n\nHmm, seems right. Alternatively, maybe I can do this with variables instead of numbers to confirm. \n\nLet me let the wholesale cost be W. Then original retail price is W + 0.6W = 1.6W. \n\nThen the selling price is 20% less than that, so 1.6W multiplied by (1 - 0.20) = 1.6W * 0.8. \n\nCalculating that: 1.6 * 0.8 = 1.28. So the selling price is 1.28W, which is 28% more than W. Yep, that matches. \n\nSo the answer should be B, 28%. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me check the options again. The options are A)20, B)28, C)36, D)40, E)42. Yep, B is there. \n\nI don't see any other possible mistakes here. The key steps are applying the percentages correctly. First, increasing by 60%, then decreasing by 20% of the new amount. So the math checks out. The answer must be B.\n",
