      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out the cost of B bottles of soda when we know that 27 bottles cost A cents. And the answer needs to be in dollars. Hmm, right. So first, maybe I should find the cost per bottle, then multiply by B, and then convert cents to dollars. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nAlright, 27 bottles cost A cents. So the cost per bottle would be A divided by 27 cents per bottle. So each bottle is (A/27) cents. Then, for B bottles, the total cost in cents would be B multiplied by that, so B*(A/27) cents. But the question asks for the cost in dollars. Oh right, because 100 cents make a dollar. So to convert cents to dollars, I need to divide by 100. \n\nPutting that together: total cost in dollars is (B * A / 27) / 100. Let me write that as (AB)/(27*100) which simplifies to AB/2700. Wait, but let me check the options. Option A is AB/2700, so that would be the first one. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't mess up the steps. So starting over: 27 bottles = A cents. So per bottle is A/27 cents. Then B bottles would be B*(A/27) cents. To get dollars, divide by 100. So (A*B)/(27*100) = AB/2700. Yeah, that's correct. Let me check the options again. Option A is exactly that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think to convert first? Like, A cents is A/100 dollars for 27 bottles. So the cost per bottle in dollars would be (A/100)/27. Then multiply by B: (A/(100*27)) * B = AB/(2700). Same result. So yeah, that's the same. So the answer must be option A. Let me check the other options to be sure. \n\nOption C is AB/270. That would be if you divided by 27 and then by 10, but since we need to divide by 100, that's not right. Option E is 100AB/27, which would be way too big. The others don't make sense. So I think A is the correct answer.\n",
