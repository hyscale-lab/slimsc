      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about converting marks from one maximum to another. Hmm. So the candidate got 504 marks out of a maximum M. Then, if the maximum M is converted to 800, his score would be 420. I need to find M.\n\nWait, how does the conversion work here? Maybe it's a proportional thing. Like, if the original score is 504/M, then when scaled to 800, that same proportion would give 420. So the ratio of his marks to the maximum remains the same?\n\nSo, setting up the equation: 504 / M = 420 / 800. Because if you convert the total marks from M to 800, the percentage should stay the same. So solving for M here.\n\nLet me write that equation down properly. 504 divided by M equals 420 over 800. Cross-multiplying, 504 * 800 = 420 * M. Then, solving for M would be (504 * 800)/420.\n\nLet me compute that. First, simplify the numbers. Let's see, 504 divided by 420. Hmm, 420 times 1.2 is 504, right? Because 420*1=420, 420*0.2=84, so 420+84=504. So 504/420 = 1.2. So that part is 1.2, then multiplied by 800.\n\nSo 1.2 * 800 = 960. Wait, so M would be 960? Let me check the options. Option E is 960. So that would be the answer?\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through again. The idea is that the proportion of the marks he got remains the same when the total is scaled. So if originally he has 504/M, converting the total to 800, his new mark is (504/M)*800 = 420. So solving that equation:\n\n(504/M)*800 =420 \u2192 504*800 =420*M \u2192 M = (504*800)/420.\n\nBreaking down the numbers: 504 divided by 420. Let's see, both are divisible by 84 perhaps? 504 \u00f7 84 is 6, and 420 \u00f784 is 5. So 504/420 =6/5. So then, (6/5)*800 = (6*160) = 960. Yep, that checks out. So M is 960, which is option E. \n\nLooking at the options again, E is 960. The other options like 270 or 2702 don't fit. So I think that's correct.\n",
