      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about figuring out how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for 12 people instead of 8, given that she bought 10 bottles for 8 people. Hmm, so first, I guess this is a proportion problem. Like, if 8 people need 10 bottles, then how many do 12 need?\n\nWait, right. So maybe I can set up a ratio. Let me think. The number of bottles is proportional to the number of people. So the ratio of bottles to people should stay the same. So 10 bottles over 8 people equals x bottles over 12 people. That's the way to set it up. \n\nSo, 10/8 = x/12. To solve for x, cross-multiply. 8x = 10 *12. Let me calculate that. 10 times 12 is 120. So 8x = 120. Then divide both sides by 8. x = 120 /8. What's 120 divided by 8? Let's see, 8*15 is 120. So x is 15. Wait, but the options don't have 15. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe the question is not directly proportional? Or maybe there's another way to think about it. Let me read the question again. \"If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\" \n\nHmm, maybe it's assuming each person drinks the same amount. So per person, it's 10 bottles divided by 8 people. That's 1.25 bottles per person. So for 12 people, that would be 12 * 1.25. Let me calculate that. 12 * 1 is 12, and 12 *0.25 is 3, so total 15. Oh right, same as before. But 15 isn't an option here. The options go up to 14 (E). Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in the setup?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is implying that 10 bottles is enough for 8 people, so per person it's 10/8, but perhaps they can share or something? Or maybe the question is a trick question where it's not directly proportional?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me see the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. None of these is 15. So perhaps the question is expecting rounding down? But that doesn't make sense. Or maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the 10 bottles are for the entire party, not per person. So maybe the number of people doesn't directly relate to the number of bottles. But that's unlikely. The question is probably expecting a proportional answer. But since 15 isn't there, maybe the question has a typo? Or perhaps I misread the numbers?\n\nWait, let me check again. The original problem says \"needed to buy 10 bottles for a party in which 8 people attended\". The new party has 12 people. The question is how many bottles for 12. So the correct answer should be 15, but since that's not an option, maybe the options are wrong? But that's impossible. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is saying that each person drinks one bottle, but she bought 10 for 8 people. So maybe there's a leftover? Like, maybe she bought 10, but they only drank 8? But that's not stated. The problem says she \"needed to buy 10 bottles for a party in which 8 people attended\". So perhaps the 10 is the total needed. So maybe the per person is 10/8, so 1.25 per person. For 12, that's 15, which is not an option. But the options don't have that. So maybe there's a different approach here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a ratio problem but using some other reasoning. Let me think. Maybe it's a rate problem. For example, if 8 people drank 10 bottles, how many does 12 need? The same as before. Hmm. Wait, maybe they are using a different ratio. Like, maybe the number of bottles increases by the same difference as the number of people? 12 is 4 more than 8, so adding 4 people. The original difference between bottles and people was 10-8=2. So adding 4 people, maybe adding 2 more bottles? 10+2=12? That would be option D. But that seems like a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that each person gets one bottle, so for 12 people, 12 bottles. But that would be answer D. But why would the original be 10 for 8? Maybe they had some leftovers. But that's assuming each person gets one, but maybe that's the case. Maybe the problem is implying that 10 bottles were sufficient for 8, so each had 1.25, but the question expects to round down to 1 per person, so 12. That's possible, but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the number of bottles doesn't change because it's for the party, not per person. But that would be 10 again (C), but that seems unlikely. \n\nHmm, the options given don't include 15. So perhaps the question was supposed to have different numbers. Wait, let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate. 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person 10/8 = 1.25. For 12 people, 12 *1.25 = 15. So that's correct. Since that's not an option, maybe the question expects a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that she bought 10 bottles for 8 people, meaning that each person gets 1 bottle, and there are 2 extra. So maybe she just buys the same number as the number of people. So for 12, she buys 12? That would be D. But that would mean that the original had 8 people and 10 bottles, so two extra. Maybe she wants to have two extra each time? So for 12, that's 12 + 2 =14 (E). Hmm, that could be. \n\nWait, maybe she wants to have the same ratio of extra bottles. Let me think. If originally, she had 8 people and bought 10, so 2 extra. The extra is 25% of the people (2/8=0.25). So for 12 people, 12 plus 25% extra would be 12 * 1.25 =15 again. Which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she just adds 2 bottles per 8 people. So for 12 people, which is 1.5 times as many, so 2*1.5=3 extra. So 12+3=15. Still same problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a direct proportion but using fractions. Like 10/8 simplifies to 5/4, so 5/4 bottles per person. For 12 people, that's 5/4 *12 = 15. Again same answer. \n\nHmm, so since 15 isn't an option, maybe the question has a mistake, but since I have to choose from the options given, perhaps I made an error in the question's interpretation. Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says \"how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\" So maybe the assumption is that each person drinks one bottle, so 12. But then why 10 for 8? Maybe she had some left over. But the question says \"needed to buy\"\u2014so maybe she needed 8, but bought 10. But that's not what the question says. The question states she \"needed to buy 10 bottles for a party with 8 people\". So that implies that 10 was the required amount. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using inverse proportion? Like, more people, fewer bottles? But that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe the question is a trick question where the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So for 12, it's 12. But then the original would have been 8, but she bought 10. So that's inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the 10 bottles are for the entire party, not per person. Like, maybe the party needs 10 bottles regardless of people. So 12 people would still be 10. But that's option C, which is 10. But that would mean the number of people doesn't affect it, which seems odd. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Since the correct answer based on proportion is 15, but that's not an option, perhaps the question intended a different setup. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the number of additional bottles needed? Like, originally 8 people needed 10, now 12 people is 4 more, so how many more bottles? But that would be 4*(10/8)=5, so total 15. Still not matching the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the number of bottles is directly proportional but rounded to the nearest whole number. But 15 is exact. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me check again: the original was 10 bottles for 8 people. The new is 12 people. The options are 6,8,10,12,14. The closest to 15 is 14. Maybe they rounded down? Or perhaps there's a different ratio. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is saying that 10 bottles are sufficient for 8 people, so for 12, how many? Maybe assuming that each person drinks 1 bottle, so 12. But the original 10 for 8 would mean she had 2 left over. Maybe she wants the same ratio of leftovers. Like, 2 extra. So for 12, 12 +2=14. That would be E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that 10 bottles last for 8 people, so per person it's 10/8 = 1.25. To have the same amount, for 12 people, it's 1.25*12=15, but since you can't have a fraction, maybe round to 14? But that's not precise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects a different approach. Like, if 8 people need 10 bottles, then the rate is 10/8 per person. So for 12, multiply 10*(12/8)= 15. Again, same. \n\nHmm. Since none of the options have 15, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options. But since I have to choose from the given options, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation? Let me recheck. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the number of bottles per person? No, that's not it. Or perhaps the question is asking for how many more bottles, not the total? The question says \"how many bottles to buy\", so total. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a ratio in simplest terms. 10:8 reduces to 5:4. So for 12 people, set up as 5/4 = x/12. Wait no, that would give 15 again. \n\nHmm. Maybe the options are wrong, but since the options given are up to 14, perhaps the intended answer is E)14, which is the closest. Alternatively, maybe the question is a proportion but using 10 per 8, so 10*(12/8) = 15, but since you can't have half bottles, you round down to 14? But that's not logical. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects that each person drinks one bottle, so 12, but that would be D. But then why did she need 10 for 8? Maybe she thought to have 2 extra. So for 12, she would have 2 extra again, making 14 (E). That might be the case. \n\nSo if the original was 8 people, and she bought 10, that's 2 extra. Maybe she wants to have 2 extra bottles regardless of the number of people. Then for 12, it would be 12 +2=14. That would be E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the extra is proportional. 2 extra for 8 people, so 2/8 per person extra. So for 12, that's 2/8 *12 =3 extra. So 12+3=15 again. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Since the options don't include 15, maybe the intended answer is E)14, perhaps they rounded down to the nearest even number or something. Or maybe I misread the question. Wait, the original problem says \"needed to buy\"\u2014so maybe she needed 10 for 8, implying that each person gets 1.25, but she can't buy a fraction. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25 is 15, but maybe she rounds to 14 because 15 isn't an option. But that's not a valid approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that each person drinks one bottle, so the answer is D)12. But then why did she buy 10 for 8? Maybe she was underestimating. The question says \"needed to buy\"\u2014so perhaps she needed exactly 10 for 8, which would imply that each person had 1.25. So the correct answer would be 15, but since that's not there, perhaps the question has a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25 per person. 12 times 1.25 is indeed 15. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, since the options don't have that, maybe I need to consider that perhaps the problem is not directly proportional. Maybe it's an inverse proportion? Like, more people mean less bottles? That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the number of bottles stays the same because it's for the party, not per person. So 10 again. That's option C. But the question says \"for a party in which 12 people are attending\"\u2014so more people would need more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a ratio problem but using a different ratio. Let me see the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. \n\nWait, 10 bottles for 8 people. Let's see the ratio 10:8 simplifies to 5:4. So for 12 people, which is 3 times 4, the bottles would be 5*3=15. Not there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 10 bottles per 8 people, so per person it's 10/8 = 1.25. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25 =15. \n\nHmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the question is a unit rate question. For instance, if 8 people need 10 bottles, then the number of people per bottle is 8/10 = 0.8 people per bottle. So for 12 people, how many bottles? 12 divided by 0.8 is 15 again. \n\nThis is perplexing. The correct answer is 15, but it's not an option. Since the options given don't include 15, perhaps the question had a typo. For instance, maybe the original number of bottles was 8 instead of 10. Let's see: If it were 8 bottles for 8 people, then 12 would be 12 (D). Or if it was 10 for 10 people, then 12 would be 12. But the problem states 10 for 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting you to set up the ratio as 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person it's 10/8, but when you multiply by 12, you do 10*(12/8) = (10*12)/8 = 120/8 =15. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the answer intended is E)14, which is the closest. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is the same as the number of people, so D)12. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking it's a proportion. Maybe the question is saying that she bought 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person, 1 bottle, and the extra 2 are for the host or something. So for 12 people, she would buy 12 bottles. That would be D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that since 8 people needed 10, then each additional person requires an additional 10/8 bottles, so 12 is 4 more people, so 4*(10/8)=5, so total 10+5=15 again. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Since none of the options are correct, but the closest is 14, perhaps that's the intended answer. Or maybe the problem expects rounding down to 14. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a proportion but using 10/8 = x/12, solving for x gives 15, but since you can't have half bottles, maybe you round to 14? But 15 is a whole number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects you to think that 10 bottles for 8 people is 1.25 per person, so for 12, it's 12*1.25=15, but the options are wrong. But the given options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again. \n\n\"Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\"\n\nWait, maybe the question is implying that the 10 bottles were for the entire party, not per person. So regardless of the number of people, she buys 10. But that would mean the answer is 10, option C. But that doesn't make sense because more people would need more soda. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick, like the same number of bottles because it's the same party. But that's not possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is expecting the answer to be 12 (D), assuming that she buys one bottle per person. But then why did she buy 10 for 8? Maybe she had extra. But the question says \"needed to buy\"\u2014so perhaps she needed exactly 10 for 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a ratio of people to bottles, but inverted. Like 8 people:10 bottles. So for 12 people, how many bottles? \n\nSo the ratio is people to bottles is 8:10 = 4:5. So for 12 people, set up 4/5 = 12/x. Cross multiply: 4x =60 \u2192 x=15. Again, same answer. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't include 15, perhaps the correct answer is E)14. Maybe they made a mistake and thought 10/8 is 1.2, so 1.2*12=14.4, rounded down to 14. But that's not accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a different original number. Like, if it was 8 bottles for 10 people, but that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to add 2 bottles per 4 people? Since from 8 to 12 is +4 people. The original had 10 bottles for 8, so adding 4 people would need adding 2 bottles (since 10+2=12 for 12 people). That would give D)12. \n\nWait, if 8 people need 10, then per 4 people, that's 5 bottles. So 12 is 8+4, so 10+5=15. But that's again 15. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different ratio. Like, the difference between the number of people and bottles. 8 people had 10 bottles, difference of +2. So for 12 people, the difference would be the same, so 12 +2=14. So answer E. \n\nHmm, that might be the case. Maybe they consider that the number of bottles is people plus 2. So 8+2=10, then 12+2=14. That would be E. \n\nI think that might be what the question is expecting. So maybe the answer is E)14. Because otherwise, there's no other way to get an answer from the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a proportion but using 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person 1 bottle plus 0.25, so for 12 people, 12 + (12*0.25)=12+3=15. Still no. \n\nHmm. I'm going to have to go with the assumption that maybe the question intended that the number of bottles increases by 2 for every 4 people. Since from 8 to 12 is 4 more people, so adding 2 bottles. So 10 + 2 =12? But that would be D. Or adding 2 per 4 people: 8 people:10, so 2 per 4. So 4 more people would be 2 more bottles. 10+2=12. So D. Alternatively, maybe 2 per 2 people? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is 5:4 (10:8 simplified). So for 12 people, which is 3 times the 4, so 5*3=15. \n\nI think the problem is that the options are wrong, but since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the closest is E)14. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a misprint and the intended answer was 15 but it's not there. In that case, maybe there's another way. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try again. \n\nThe problem is: 8 people \u2192 10 bottles. 12 people \u2192 ?\n\nAssuming proportional relationship:\n\n10 bottles /8 people = x bottles/12 people \u2192 x = (10 *12)/8 = 150/10 \u2192 Wait, no. Wait 10*12=120 divided by 8 is 15. Yeah, that's correct. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't have 15, but E is 14, maybe they did 10*(12/8)=15 but subtracted one? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not proportional. Maybe Jill bought 10 bottles for 8 people, so that's 1.25 per person. For 12 people, she would need 12*1.25=15, but she can only buy whole bottles. So she needs to round up to 15, but since that's not an option, the next lower is 14? But that would mean she's short by 1 bottle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that she uses the same rate but in a different way. Like, if 8 people need 10, then 1 person needs 10/8, so 12 people need 10/8*12=15. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since all calculations lead to 15, which isn't an option, but the closest is E)14, perhaps that's the intended answer, assuming that maybe they used 10/8=1.25, then multiplied by 12 to get 15, but rounded down to 14. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach. Maybe it's a ratio problem where the difference in people is 4 (from 8 to 12), so adding 4 people requires adding (4/8)*10=5 bottles. So 10+5=15 again. \n\nHmm. I think the problem must have an error. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the best possible answer is E)14, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake and the correct answer is D)12. \n\nWait another approach: Maybe the question is asking for how many more bottles needed? Like, originally 10 for 8, now 12, so 4 more people. So how many more bottles? 4*(10/8)=5. So total 15. Again, same. \n\nAlternatively, the question is asking for the number of bottles per person multiplied by the number of people. Which would be 1.25*12=15. \n\nHmm. I think there's a mistake in the options provided. But since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is E)14. Or maybe I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the number of bottles is the same as the number of people, so for 12 people it's 12. That would be D. But why 10 for 8 then? Maybe she bought 1 per person plus 2 extra, so for 12, that would be 12 +2=14 (E). \n\nAh, that makes sense. So if she bought 10 for 8 people, that's 1 per person plus 2 extra. So for 12, it would be 12+2=14. So the answer is E)14. \n\nYes, that must be it. The question assumes that she buys one per person plus two extra, so for 12 people, 14. That would fit option E. \n\nOkay, I think that's the way they want it. So the answer is E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem requires determining the number of soda bottles needed for 12 people, given that 10 bottles were sufficient for 8 people. Assuming proportionality, the calculation is as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 \\text{ bottles}}{8 \\text{ people}} = \\frac{x \\text{ bottles}}{12 \\text{ people}} \\implies x = \\frac{10 \\times 12}{8} = 15.\n\\]\n\nHowever, 15 is not among the options. Considering possible rounding or alternative interpretations, if Jill bought 2 extra bottles for 8 people (10 total), she might maintain the same extra ratio. For 12 people, this would be \\(12 + 2 = 14\\), aligning with option **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about figuring out how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for 12 people instead of 8, given that she bought 10 bottles for 8 people. Hmm, so first, I guess this is a proportion problem. Like, if 8 people need 10 bottles, then how many do 12 need?\n\nWait, right. So maybe I can set up a ratio. Let me think. The number of bottles is proportional to the number of people. So the ratio of bottles to people should stay the same. So 10 bottles over 8 people equals x bottles over 12 people. That's the way to set it up. \n\nSo, 10/8 = x/12. To solve for x, cross-multiply. 8x = 10 *12. Let me calculate that. 10 times 12 is 120. So 8x = 120. Then divide both sides by 8. x = 120 /8. What's 120 divided by 8? Let's see, 8*15 is 120. So x is 15. Wait, but the options don't have 15. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I do something wrong?\n\nWait, maybe the question is not directly proportional? Or maybe there's another way to think about it. Let me read the question again. \"If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\" \n\nHmm, maybe it's assuming each person drinks the same amount. So per person, it's 10 bottles divided by 8 people. That's 1.25 bottles per person. So for 12 people, that would be 12 * 1.25. Let me calculate that. 12 * 1 is 12, and 12 *0.25 is 3, so total 15. Oh right, same as before. But 15 isn't an option here. The options go up to 14 (E). Wait, so maybe I made a mistake in the setup?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is implying that 10 bottles is enough for 8 people, so per person it's 10/8, but perhaps they can share or something? Or maybe the question is a trick question where it's not directly proportional?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me see the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. None of these is 15. So perhaps the question is expecting rounding down? But that doesn't make sense. Or maybe there's a different interpretation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the 10 bottles are for the entire party, not per person. So maybe the number of people doesn't directly relate to the number of bottles. But that's unlikely. The question is probably expecting a proportional answer. But since 15 isn't there, maybe the question has a typo? Or perhaps I misread the numbers?\n\nWait, let me check again. The original problem says \"needed to buy 10 bottles for a party in which 8 people attended\". The new party has 12 people. The question is how many bottles for 12. So the correct answer should be 15, but since that's not an option, maybe the options are wrong? But that's impossible. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is saying that each person drinks one bottle, but she bought 10 for 8 people. So maybe there's a leftover? Like, maybe she bought 10, but they only drank 8? But that's not stated. The problem says she \"needed to buy 10 bottles for a party in which 8 people attended\". So perhaps the 10 is the total needed. So maybe the per person is 10/8, so 1.25 per person. For 12, that's 15, which is not an option. But the options don't have that. So maybe there's a different approach here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a ratio problem but using some other reasoning. Let me think. Maybe it's a rate problem. For example, if 8 people drank 10 bottles, how many does 12 need? The same as before. Hmm. Wait, maybe they are using a different ratio. Like, maybe the number of bottles increases by the same difference as the number of people? 12 is 4 more than 8, so adding 4 people. The original difference between bottles and people was 10-8=2. So adding 4 people, maybe adding 2 more bottles? 10+2=12? That would be option D. But that seems like a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that each person gets one bottle, so for 12 people, 12 bottles. But that would be answer D. But why would the original be 10 for 8? Maybe they had some leftovers. But that's assuming each person gets one, but maybe that's the case. Maybe the problem is implying that 10 bottles were sufficient for 8, so each had 1.25, but the question expects to round down to 1 per person, so 12. That's possible, but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the number of bottles doesn't change because it's for the party, not per person. But that would be 10 again (C), but that seems unlikely. \n\nHmm, the options given don't include 15. So perhaps the question was supposed to have different numbers. Wait, let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate. 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person 10/8 = 1.25. For 12 people, 12 *1.25 = 15. So that's correct. Since that's not an option, maybe the question expects a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that she bought 10 bottles for 8 people, meaning that each person gets 1 bottle, and there are 2 extra. So maybe she just buys the same number as the number of people. So for 12, she buys 12? That would be D. But that would mean that the original had 8 people and 10 bottles, so two extra. Maybe she wants to have two extra each time? So for 12, that's 12 + 2 =14 (E). Hmm, that could be. \n\nWait, maybe she wants to have the same ratio of extra bottles. Let me think. If originally, she had 8 people and bought 10, so 2 extra. The extra is 25% of the people (2/8=0.25). So for 12 people, 12 plus 25% extra would be 12 * 1.25 =15 again. Which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she just adds 2 bottles per 8 people. So for 12 people, which is 1.5 times as many, so 2*1.5=3 extra. So 12+3=15. Still same problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a direct proportion but using fractions. Like 10/8 simplifies to 5/4, so 5/4 bottles per person. For 12 people, that's 5/4 *12 = 15. Again same answer. \n\nHmm, so since 15 isn't an option, maybe the question has a mistake, but since I have to choose from the options given, perhaps I made an error in the question's interpretation. Let me read it again. \n\nThe question says \"how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\" So maybe the assumption is that each person drinks one bottle, so 12. But then why 10 for 8? Maybe she had some left over. But the question says \"needed to buy\"\u2014so maybe she needed 8, but bought 10. But that's not what the question says. The question states she \"needed to buy 10 bottles for a party with 8 people\". So that implies that 10 was the required amount. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is using inverse proportion? Like, more people, fewer bottles? But that doesn't make sense. \n\nWait, maybe the question is a trick question where the number of bottles is the same as the number of people. So for 12, it's 12. But then the original would have been 8, but she bought 10. So that's inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the 10 bottles are for the entire party, not per person. Like, maybe the party needs 10 bottles regardless of people. So 12 people would still be 10. But that's option C, which is 10. But that would mean the number of people doesn't affect it, which seems odd. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Since the correct answer based on proportion is 15, but that's not an option, perhaps the question intended a different setup. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the number of additional bottles needed? Like, originally 8 people needed 10, now 12 people is 4 more, so how many more bottles? But that would be 4*(10/8)=5, so total 15. Still not matching the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the number of bottles is directly proportional but rounded to the nearest whole number. But 15 is exact. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me check again: the original was 10 bottles for 8 people. The new is 12 people. The options are 6,8,10,12,14. The closest to 15 is 14. Maybe they rounded down? Or perhaps there's a different ratio. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is saying that 10 bottles are sufficient for 8 people, so for 12, how many? Maybe assuming that each person drinks 1 bottle, so 12. But the original 10 for 8 would mean she had 2 left over. Maybe she wants the same ratio of leftovers. Like, 2 extra. So for 12, 12 +2=14. That would be E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that 10 bottles last for 8 people, so per person it's 10/8 = 1.25. To have the same amount, for 12 people, it's 1.25*12=15, but since you can't have a fraction, maybe round to 14? But that's not precise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects a different approach. Like, if 8 people need 10 bottles, then the rate is 10/8 per person. So for 12, multiply 10*(12/8)= 15. Again, same. \n\nHmm. Since none of the options have 15, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options. But since I have to choose from the given options, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation? Let me recheck. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the number of bottles per person? No, that's not it. Or perhaps the question is asking for how many more bottles, not the total? The question says \"how many bottles to buy\", so total. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a ratio in simplest terms. 10:8 reduces to 5:4. So for 12 people, set up as 5/4 = x/12. Wait no, that would give 15 again. \n\nHmm. Maybe the options are wrong, but since the options given are up to 14, perhaps the intended answer is E)14, which is the closest. Alternatively, maybe the question is a proportion but using 10 per 8, so 10*(12/8) = 15, but since you can't have half bottles, you round down to 14? But that's not logical. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects that each person drinks one bottle, so 12, but that would be D. But then why did she need 10 for 8? Maybe she thought to have 2 extra. So for 12, she would have 2 extra again, making 14 (E). That might be the case. \n\nSo if the original was 8 people, and she bought 10, that's 2 extra. Maybe she wants to have 2 extra bottles regardless of the number of people. Then for 12, it would be 12 +2=14. That would be E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the extra is proportional. 2 extra for 8 people, so 2/8 per person extra. So for 12, that's 2/8 *12 =3 extra. So 12+3=15 again. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Since the options don't include 15, maybe the intended answer is E)14, perhaps they rounded down to the nearest even number or something. Or maybe I misread the question. Wait, the original problem says \"needed to buy\"\u2014so maybe she needed 10 for 8, implying that each person gets 1.25, but she can't buy a fraction. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25 is 15, but maybe she rounds to 14 because 15 isn't an option. But that's not a valid approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that each person drinks one bottle, so the answer is D)12. But then why did she buy 10 for 8? Maybe she was underestimating. The question says \"needed to buy\"\u2014so perhaps she needed exactly 10 for 8, which would imply that each person had 1.25. So the correct answer would be 15, but since that's not there, perhaps the question has a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25 per person. 12 times 1.25 is indeed 15. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, since the options don't have that, maybe I need to consider that perhaps the problem is not directly proportional. Maybe it's an inverse proportion? Like, more people mean less bottles? That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the number of bottles stays the same because it's for the party, not per person. So 10 again. That's option C. But the question says \"for a party in which 12 people are attending\"\u2014so more people would need more. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a ratio problem but using a different ratio. Let me see the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. \n\nWait, 10 bottles for 8 people. Let's see the ratio 10:8 simplifies to 5:4. So for 12 people, which is 3 times 4, the bottles would be 5*3=15. Not there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's 10 bottles per 8 people, so per person it's 10/8 = 1.25. So for 12 people, 12 *1.25 =15. \n\nHmm. Since none of the options match, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the question is a unit rate question. For instance, if 8 people need 10 bottles, then the number of people per bottle is 8/10 = 0.8 people per bottle. So for 12 people, how many bottles? 12 divided by 0.8 is 15 again. \n\nThis is perplexing. The correct answer is 15, but it's not an option. Since the options given don't include 15, perhaps the question had a typo. For instance, maybe the original number of bottles was 8 instead of 10. Let's see: If it were 8 bottles for 8 people, then 12 would be 12 (D). Or if it was 10 for 10 people, then 12 would be 12. But the problem states 10 for 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting you to set up the ratio as 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person it's 10/8, but when you multiply by 12, you do 10*(12/8) = (10*12)/8 = 120/8 =15. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't have that, perhaps the answer intended is E)14, which is the closest. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is the same as the number of people, so D)12. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking it's a proportion. Maybe the question is saying that she bought 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person, 1 bottle, and the extra 2 are for the host or something. So for 12 people, she would buy 12 bottles. That would be D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that since 8 people needed 10, then each additional person requires an additional 10/8 bottles, so 12 is 4 more people, so 4*(10/8)=5, so total 10+5=15 again. \n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Since none of the options are correct, but the closest is 14, perhaps that's the intended answer. Or maybe the problem expects rounding down to 14. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a proportion but using 10/8 = x/12, solving for x gives 15, but since you can't have half bottles, maybe you round to 14? But 15 is a whole number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects you to think that 10 bottles for 8 people is 1.25 per person, so for 12, it's 12*1.25=15, but the options are wrong. But the given options don't have that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me read it again. \n\n\"Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\"\n\nWait, maybe the question is implying that the 10 bottles were for the entire party, not per person. So regardless of the number of people, she buys 10. But that would mean the answer is 10, option C. But that doesn't make sense because more people would need more soda. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick, like the same number of bottles because it's the same party. But that's not possible. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is expecting the answer to be 12 (D), assuming that she buys one bottle per person. But then why did she buy 10 for 8? Maybe she had extra. But the question says \"needed to buy\"\u2014so perhaps she needed exactly 10 for 8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a ratio of people to bottles, but inverted. Like 8 people:10 bottles. So for 12 people, how many bottles? \n\nSo the ratio is people to bottles is 8:10 = 4:5. So for 12 people, set up 4/5 = 12/x. Cross multiply: 4x =60 \u2192 x=15. Again, same answer. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't include 15, perhaps the correct answer is E)14. Maybe they made a mistake and thought 10/8 is 1.2, so 1.2*12=14.4, rounded down to 14. But that's not accurate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a different original number. Like, if it was 8 bottles for 10 people, but that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to add 2 bottles per 4 people? Since from 8 to 12 is +4 people. The original had 10 bottles for 8, so adding 4 people would need adding 2 bottles (since 10+2=12 for 12 people). That would give D)12. \n\nWait, if 8 people need 10, then per 4 people, that's 5 bottles. So 12 is 8+4, so 10+5=15. But that's again 15. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using a different ratio. Like, the difference between the number of people and bottles. 8 people had 10 bottles, difference of +2. So for 12 people, the difference would be the same, so 12 +2=14. So answer E. \n\nHmm, that might be the case. Maybe they consider that the number of bottles is people plus 2. So 8+2=10, then 12+2=14. That would be E. \n\nI think that might be what the question is expecting. So maybe the answer is E)14. Because otherwise, there's no other way to get an answer from the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a proportion but using 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person 1 bottle plus 0.25, so for 12 people, 12 + (12*0.25)=12+3=15. Still no. \n\nHmm. I'm going to have to go with the assumption that maybe the question intended that the number of bottles increases by 2 for every 4 people. Since from 8 to 12 is 4 more people, so adding 2 bottles. So 10 + 2 =12? But that would be D. Or adding 2 per 4 people: 8 people:10, so 2 per 4. So 4 more people would be 2 more bottles. 10+2=12. So D. Alternatively, maybe 2 per 2 people? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio is 5:4 (10:8 simplified). So for 12 people, which is 3 times the 4, so 5*3=15. \n\nI think the problem is that the options are wrong, but since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the closest is E)14. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a misprint and the intended answer was 15 but it's not there. In that case, maybe there's another way. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me try again. \n\nThe problem is: 8 people \u2192 10 bottles. 12 people \u2192 ?\n\nAssuming proportional relationship:\n\n10 bottles /8 people = x bottles/12 people \u2192 x = (10 *12)/8 = 150/10 \u2192 Wait, no. Wait 10*12=120 divided by 8 is 15. Yeah, that's correct. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't have 15, but E is 14, maybe they did 10*(12/8)=15 but subtracted one? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not proportional. Maybe Jill bought 10 bottles for 8 people, so that's 1.25 per person. For 12 people, she would need 12*1.25=15, but she can only buy whole bottles. So she needs to round up to 15, but since that's not an option, the next lower is 14? But that would mean she's short by 1 bottle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that she uses the same rate but in a different way. Like, if 8 people need 10, then 1 person needs 10/8, so 12 people need 10/8*12=15. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since all calculations lead to 15, which isn't an option, but the closest is E)14, perhaps that's the intended answer, assuming that maybe they used 10/8=1.25, then multiplied by 12 to get 15, but rounded down to 14. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach. Maybe it's a ratio problem where the difference in people is 4 (from 8 to 12), so adding 4 people requires adding (4/8)*10=5 bottles. So 10+5=15 again. \n\nHmm. I think the problem must have an error. But since I have to choose from the options, perhaps the best possible answer is E)14, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake and the correct answer is D)12. \n\nWait another approach: Maybe the question is asking for how many more bottles needed? Like, originally 10 for 8, now 12, so 4 more people. So how many more bottles? 4*(10/8)=5. So total 15. Again, same. \n\nAlternatively, the question is asking for the number of bottles per person multiplied by the number of people. Which would be 1.25*12=15. \n\nHmm. I think there's a mistake in the options provided. But since I have to choose, perhaps the intended answer is E)14. Or maybe I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the number of bottles is the same as the number of people, so for 12 people it's 12. That would be D. But why 10 for 8 then? Maybe she bought 1 per person plus 2 extra, so for 12, that would be 12 +2=14 (E). \n\nAh, that makes sense. So if she bought 10 for 8 people, that's 1 per person plus 2 extra. So for 12, it would be 12+2=14. So the answer is E)14. \n\nYes, that must be it. The question assumes that she buys one per person plus two extra, so for 12 people, 14. That would fit option E. \n\nOkay, I think that's the way they want it. So the answer is E.\n\n\nThe problem requires determining the number of soda bottles needed for 12 people, given that 10 bottles were sufficient for 8 people. Assuming proportionality, the calculation is as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 \\text{ bottles}}{8 \\text{ people}} = \\frac{x \\text{ bottles}}{12 \\text{ people}} \\implies x = \\frac{10 \\times 12}{8} = 15.\n\\]\n\nHowever, 15 is not among the options. Considering possible rounding or alternative interpretations, if Jill bought 2 extra bottles for 8 people (10 total), she might maintain the same extra ratio. For 12 people, this would be \\(12 + 2 = 14\\), aligning with option **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about figuring out how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 people, given that she bought 10 bottles for 8 people. Hmm, I need to think about the relationship between the number of people and the bottles. \n\nWait, the first thing that comes to mind is whether this is a proportion problem. Like, maybe the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people. So if there are more people, she needs more bottles. Let me see. \n\nThe original scenario: 8 people = 10 bottles. So maybe each person gets a certain number of bottles. Let me calculate the rate. So 10 bottles divided by 8 people would be 1.25 bottles per person. Oh right, that makes sense. So each person gets 1.25 bottles on average.\n\nNow, for 12 people, we can multiply that rate by 12. Let me do the math: 1.25 times 12. Hmm, 1.25 times 12. Well, 1 times 12 is 12, and 0.25 times 12 is 3, so total 15? Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 15. Wait, hold on. Did I do that right? Let me check again. 10 divided by 8 is indeed 1.25. So 1.25 multiplied by 12. Let me recalculate that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe set up a proportion. 10 bottles /8 people = x bottles /12 people. Cross-multiplying gives 8x = 10 *12. So 8x = 120. Then x = 120 /8. 120 divided by 8 is 15. Oh, but the options don't have 15. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. Wait, that's a problem. Did I misread the question?\n\nLet me read again. The question says \"If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\" The options are A to E as listed. But according to my calculation, the answer should be 15, which isn't among the choices. That must mean I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm, maybe the assumption that it's directly proportional isn't correct here. Maybe there's another way. Let me think again. Perhaps the question is implying that each person drinks one bottle, and the extra two are just for herself or some other reason. Wait, but the question doesn't specify any such thing. So maybe the problem expects a different approach. \n\nWait, maybe the question is a trick question. Like, maybe the number of bottles doesn't scale directly. Maybe Jill bought 10 bottles for 8 people, so perhaps each person gets one bottle, and there are 2 extra. Then for 12 people, she would need 12 plus 2, which is 14? That would be option E. But that's an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she bought 10 bottles for 8 people, so maybe per person it's 1 bottle each, with 2 left over. So for 12 people, she just needs 12. But that would be D. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. The problem might be expecting a proportional reasoning but perhaps rounded down. Let me see. If 8 people need 10, then per person is 10/8 = 1.25. So 12 people would be 15. But since the options don't have that, maybe the question is expecting a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a ratio problem. Let me see. The ratio of people is 12/8, which simplifies to 3/2. So multiply the original 10 by 3/2. 10*(3/2) =15. Again, same answer. But the options don't include 15. So either I'm missing something, or perhaps the question is designed to have an answer that's not exactly proportional. \n\nWait, maybe it's a unit rate problem where the 10 bottles are for all the people, so per person it's 10 divided by 8, but maybe they want whole bottles, so she can't buy a fraction. So perhaps she needs to round up. Wait, but 1.25 times 12 is 15, which is exact. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that the number of bottles is proportional but using a different method. Like, maybe the difference in people is 4 more (from 8 to 12 is +4). So per person, that would be 10/8 = 1.25, so 4 people would need 5 more (since 4*1.25=5), so total 15. Again same problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick question. Like, maybe the answer is 12, assuming that each person gets one bottle. But that would be a different assumption. But the original scenario says 8 people had 10, so maybe the two extra are just because she wanted to have some extra, not per person. So for 12, maybe she would just buy 12, but that seems inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the number of bottles is proportional to the number of people, but rounded down. Let me check. If 8 people need 10, then 12 is 1.5 times 8. 10 * 1.5 is 15. Still no. \n\nHmm, maybe the question is in error. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read again. \n\nWait, the question says \"how many bottles of soda will she need to buy\". Maybe \"need\" implies that she can't buy partial bottles, so 15 is the exact number, but the options don't have that. So maybe the closest answer? But the options don't have 15. Wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is a ratio problem where the ratio of people is 8:12, which reduces to 2:3. So the ratio of bottles would be the same. So 10 bottles corresponds to 8 people, so for 12 people (which is 1.5 times as many), the bottles would be 10*1.5 =15. Still the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that each person drinks one bottle, so 8 people need 8, but she bought 10. So perhaps there's a 25% extra. So for 12, she would need 12 plus 25% of 12, which is 15. Still no. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick question where the answer is 12, because the number of people increased by 50% (from 8 to 12 is 1.5 times), so 10*1.5 is 15, but perhaps the question is expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is not directly proportional. For example, maybe the 10 bottles are for all the people, so 10/8 per person, but perhaps she is only buying one per person. Then 12 would be 12. But that would ignore the original 10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a proportion problem where you set up 8 people to 10 bottles, so 12 people to x bottles. So cross-multiplying gives 8x=120, so x=15. But since that's not an option, perhaps there's an error. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting that you assume each person drinks one bottle, so 8 people needed 8 bottles, but she bought 10. So maybe she's buying 2 extra. Then for 12 people, she would buy 12 plus 2, which is 14. That's option E. That might be the intended answer. Because the problem might be implying that she bought 10 for 8 people, so 2 extra, so for 12, she buys 12 plus 2, making 14. \n\nHmm, that's a possible approach. Let me think again. If there were 8 people and she bought 10, maybe that's 1 per person plus 2 extra. So the formula would be number of people plus 2. So for 12, that would be 14. That would give E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she bought 1.25 per person, but since you can't buy a fraction, you round up. But 12*1.25 is exactly 15, so you can't round up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a proportion but the answer is the closest option. But 15 is not there. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check the math again. \n\nOriginal ratio: 10 bottles for 8 people. So per person, 10/8 = 1.25. \n\n12 people would need 12 *1.25 =15. So 15 is the exact answer. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is expecting that you use a different method. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not about direct proportion. Maybe it's a rate problem where she needs 10 bottles for 8 people, so per person it's 10 divided by 8, but maybe the question expects a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the number of bottles is the same as the number of people, so 12. But that would ignore the original ratio. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that since 8 people needed 10, then for each additional person, you add 1 bottle. So 8 people:10, so 2 extra. So for 12, that's 4 more people, so 4 more bottles, total 14. That would be E. \n\nYes, that's another way. If the extra 2 are for the party, like maybe for the host or something, so per person 1 bottle, plus 2. So for 12 people, 12 +2=14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 extra are for every 8 people. So for 8, it's 10. Then 12 is 1.5 times, so 10*1.5=15. Not in options. \n\nHmm. The options don't have 15. So maybe the question is expecting us to think that the number of bottles is proportional but rounded down. Like, maybe she can't buy half bottles. Wait, but 12 people would need 15. But maybe she rounds down to 14? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a ratio problem where you set up the proportion as 8:10 =12:x, so cross multiply 8x=120, so x=15. Since that's not an option, perhaps there is a mistake in the question. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a proportion but in reverse? Like, 10 bottles for 8 people, so how many people can 12 bottles serve? But that would be different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that she buys the same number as the number of people, so 12. So D. But then why 10 for 8? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where you need to subtract. Like, if 8 people needed 10, maybe 2 people less would need less? But the question is about more people. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Since the options don't have 15, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is not about the number of bottles per person but that she buys a certain number per person plus something else. For example, maybe each person drinks 1 bottle and she buys an extra 2. So 8 people: 8 +2 =10. Then 12 people would be 12+2=14. That's E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she buys 1.25 per person, so 12*1.25=15. But since the options don't have that, maybe the question expects to round down to 14? But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a mistake and the answer is E. 14. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a direct proportion but using a different method. Let me see: 8 people to 12 people is an increase of 50%. So increasing 10 by 50% gives 15. Not there. \n\nHmm. Well, the options are given. Since 15 isn't there, perhaps the correct answer is E)14. Because that would be the closest, assuming that she adds 2 extra bottles regardless of the number of people. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects the answer to be 10, but that's option C, which is the original number. That wouldn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the number of bottles is the same as the number of people, so D)12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that since 8 people need 10, then per person it's 10/8=1.25, but since you can't buy a quarter bottle, she would need to round up each to 2 per person, so 8 people would need 16, but she only bought 10. So that's not right. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The calculation gives 15, which is not an option. The possible answers are E)14 or D)12. \n\nWait, maybe the question is not directly proportional. Maybe it's a ratio where the number of bottles is half the number of people plus something. Like 8 people need 10, so 10 is 8 +2. So 12 would be 12+2=14. That would give E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that each person gets one bottle, so for 8 people, 8 bottles, but she bought 10. The extra 2 might be a fixed number. So for 12, it's 12 +2=14. \n\nYes, that's possible. Since that's an option, perhaps that's the intended answer. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is E)14.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many bottles Jill needs for 12 people, we first calculate the rate of bottles per person from the original scenario.

However, since 15 is not an option, we consider alternative interpretations. \n\nAnother approach assumes Jill buys 1 bottle per person plus a fixed extra.

      "full_content": "Okay, so the problem here is about figuring out how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for a party with 12 people, given that she bought 10 bottles for 8 people. Hmm, I need to think about the relationship between the number of people and the bottles. \n\nWait, the first thing that comes to mind is whether this is a proportion problem. Like, maybe the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people. So if there are more people, she needs more bottles. Let me see. \n\nThe original scenario: 8 people = 10 bottles. So maybe each person gets a certain number of bottles. Let me calculate the rate. So 10 bottles divided by 8 people would be 1.25 bottles per person. Oh right, that makes sense. So each person gets 1.25 bottles on average.\n\nNow, for 12 people, we can multiply that rate by 12. Let me do the math: 1.25 times 12. Hmm, 1.25 times 12. Well, 1 times 12 is 12, and 0.25 times 12 is 3, so total 15? Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have 15. Wait, hold on. Did I do that right? Let me check again. 10 divided by 8 is indeed 1.25. So 1.25 multiplied by 12. Let me recalculate that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe set up a proportion. 10 bottles /8 people = x bottles /12 people. Cross-multiplying gives 8x = 10 *12. So 8x = 120. Then x = 120 /8. 120 divided by 8 is 15. Oh, but the options don't have 15. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. Wait, that's a problem. Did I misread the question?\n\nLet me read again. The question says \"If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\" The options are A to E as listed. But according to my calculation, the answer should be 15, which isn't among the choices. That must mean I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nHmm, maybe the assumption that it's directly proportional isn't correct here. Maybe there's another way. Let me think again. Perhaps the question is implying that each person drinks one bottle, and the extra two are just for herself or some other reason. Wait, but the question doesn't specify any such thing. So maybe the problem expects a different approach. \n\nWait, maybe the question is a trick question. Like, maybe the number of bottles doesn't scale directly. Maybe Jill bought 10 bottles for 8 people, so perhaps each person gets one bottle, and there are 2 extra. Then for 12 people, she would need 12 plus 2, which is 14? That would be option E. But that's an assumption. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she bought 10 bottles for 8 people, so maybe per person it's 1 bottle each, with 2 left over. So for 12 people, she just needs 12. But that would be D. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. The problem might be expecting a proportional reasoning but perhaps rounded down. Let me see. If 8 people need 10, then per person is 10/8 = 1.25. So 12 people would be 15. But since the options don't have that, maybe the question is expecting a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a ratio problem. Let me see. The ratio of people is 12/8, which simplifies to 3/2. So multiply the original 10 by 3/2. 10*(3/2) =15. Again, same answer. But the options don't include 15. So either I'm missing something, or perhaps the question is designed to have an answer that's not exactly proportional. \n\nWait, maybe it's a unit rate problem where the 10 bottles are for all the people, so per person it's 10 divided by 8, but maybe they want whole bottles, so she can't buy a fraction. So perhaps she needs to round up. Wait, but 1.25 times 12 is 15, which is exact. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that the number of bottles is proportional but using a different method. Like, maybe the difference in people is 4 more (from 8 to 12 is +4). So per person, that would be 10/8 = 1.25, so 4 people would need 5 more (since 4*1.25=5), so total 15. Again same problem. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick question. Like, maybe the answer is 12, assuming that each person gets one bottle. But that would be a different assumption. But the original scenario says 8 people had 10, so maybe the two extra are just because she wanted to have some extra, not per person. So for 12, maybe she would just buy 12, but that seems inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the number of bottles is proportional to the number of people, but rounded down. Let me check. If 8 people need 10, then 12 is 1.5 times 8. 10 * 1.5 is 15. Still no. \n\nHmm, maybe the question is in error. But since the options are given, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read again. \n\nWait, the question says \"how many bottles of soda will she need to buy\". Maybe \"need\" implies that she can't buy partial bottles, so 15 is the exact number, but the options don't have that. So maybe the closest answer? But the options don't have 15. Wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is a ratio problem where the ratio of people is 8:12, which reduces to 2:3. So the ratio of bottles would be the same. So 10 bottles corresponds to 8 people, so for 12 people (which is 1.5 times as many), the bottles would be 10*1.5 =15. Still the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that each person drinks one bottle, so 8 people need 8, but she bought 10. So perhaps there's a 25% extra. So for 12, she would need 12 plus 25% of 12, which is 15. Still no. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is a trick question where the answer is 12, because the number of people increased by 50% (from 8 to 12 is 1.5 times), so 10*1.5 is 15, but perhaps the question is expecting a different approach. Alternatively, maybe the question is not directly proportional. For example, maybe the 10 bottles are for all the people, so 10/8 per person, but perhaps she is only buying one per person. Then 12 would be 12. But that would ignore the original 10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a proportion problem where you set up 8 people to 10 bottles, so 12 people to x bottles. So cross-multiplying gives 8x=120, so x=15. But since that's not an option, perhaps there's an error. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting that you assume each person drinks one bottle, so 8 people needed 8 bottles, but she bought 10. So maybe she's buying 2 extra. Then for 12 people, she would buy 12 plus 2, which is 14. That's option E. That might be the intended answer. Because the problem might be implying that she bought 10 for 8 people, so 2 extra, so for 12, she buys 12 plus 2, making 14. \n\nHmm, that's a possible approach. Let me think again. If there were 8 people and she bought 10, maybe that's 1 per person plus 2 extra. So the formula would be number of people plus 2. So for 12, that would be 14. That would give E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she bought 1.25 per person, but since you can't buy a fraction, you round up. But 12*1.25 is exactly 15, so you can't round up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a proportion but the answer is the closest option. But 15 is not there. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake.
