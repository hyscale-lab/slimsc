      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a three-digit number. Let's see what the question says again. The sum of the digits is 17, the sum of their squares is 109, and when you subtract 495 from the number, you get the reverse of the original number. The options are given as A to E. Hmm, I need to find which one of these numbers fits all the conditions. \n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. Let me start by denoting the three-digit number as ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens, and C is the units digit. So the actual number is 100A + 10B + C. When we subtract 495 from this number, the result should be CBA, which is 100C + 10B + A. So the equation would be:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\n\nHmm, let's rearrange that equation. Subtract the right side from both sides to get:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 - 100C -10B -A =0 \n\nSimplify terms: (100A - A) + (10B -10B) + (C -100C) -495 =0 \n\nThat becomes 99A -99C -495 =0 \n\nFactor out 99: 99(A - C) =495 \n\nDivide both sides by 99: A - C = 495/99. Wait, 495 divided by 99. Let me compute that. 99*5 is 495, right? Because 100*5 is 500, minus 5 is 495. So 99*5=495. So then A - C =5. \n\nSo that's one equation: A = C +5. \n\nOkay, so the hundreds digit is 5 more than the units digit. Got that. \n\nNow, the sum of the digits is 17. So A + B + C =17. \n\nAnd the sum of the squares is 109: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109. \n\nSo now, I need to find digits A, B, C such that these equations hold, and also when subtracting 495, the reversed number is formed. \n\nSince the options are given, maybe it's easier to check each option against these conditions. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's list the options:\n\nA) 368 \u2192 digits 3,6,8\n\nB) 377 \u2192 3,7,7\n\nC)288 \u21922,8,8\n\nD)997 \u21929,9,7\n\nE)112 \u21921,1,2\n\nWait, but let me check each one step by step. \n\nStarting with option A: 368. Let's check the conditions. \n\nFirst, sum of digits: 3+6+8 =17? 3+6 is 9, plus 8 is 17. Yes, that's good. \n\nSum of squares: 3\u00b2 +6\u00b2 +8\u00b2 =9 +36 +64 = 109. 9+36 is 45, plus 64 is 109. Perfect, that's correct. \n\nNow the third condition: subtracting 495. Let's compute 368 -495. Wait, that would be a negative number. But the problem says subtracting 495 gives the reverse. The reverse of 368 is 863. But 368 is smaller than 495, so 368-495 would be negative, but the reverse is 863, which is positive. So that can't be. So A is invalid. \n\nHmm, so A is out. \n\nNext, option B: 377. \n\nSum of digits: 3+7+7 =17? 3+7 is 10, plus 7 is 17. Yes. \n\nSum of squares: 3\u00b2 +7\u00b2 +7\u00b2 =9 +49 +49 = 9+98=107. Wait, 107? But the problem states the sum of squares should be 109. So that's 2 less. So B is out. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption C:288. Digits 2,8,8. \n\nSum: 2+8+8 =18, which is more than 17. So that's already invalid. So C is out. \n\nOption D:997. Digits 9,9,7. \n\nSum:9+9+7=25. Not 17. So no. \n\nOption E:112. Sum is 1+1+2=4. Nope. \n\nHmm, so none of the options except A and B passed the first two conditions. Wait, but A failed the third condition. Let me check B again. Wait B's sum was 17, but sum of squares was 107 instead of 109. \n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck B's sum of squares. \n\nB is 3,7,7. So 3 squared is 9, 7 squared is 49, another 49. 9+49 is 58, plus 49 is 107. Yeah, that's right. So that's not 109. So that's a problem. \n\nHmm, so maybe none of the options except A and B pass the first two conditions, but A fails the third. Wait, so maybe I made an error in considering the equations. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says when you subtract 495 from the number, you get the reverse. Let me check for option A again. \n\nOriginal number is 368. Subtracting 495 gives 368 -495 = -127. The reverse of 368 is 863. But -127 is not equal to 863. So that's not right. So A is invalid. \n\nHmm. So none of the options are valid? That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check my equations again. \n\nWait, the problem says subtract 495 from the number and get the reverse. The reverse is a three-digit number. So if the original number is ABC, then the reverse is CBA. So the equation is ABC - 495 = CBA. \n\nTherefore, ABC - CBA = 495. \n\nWait, so ABC must be larger than CBA by exactly 495. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up the equation properly. Let me do that again. \n\nLet me denote the original number as N = 100A +10B + C. \n\nThen N - 495 = 100C +10B + A. \n\nTherefore, rearranged: \n\nN - (reverse of N) = 495. \n\nSo N - reverse(N) = 495. \n\nHmm, so perhaps N is larger than reverse(N) by 495. \n\nLet me compute for option A: 368 - 863 = -495. So 368 - 863 = -495, so 368 = 863 -495. But the question says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So 368 -495 would be -127, which is not the reverse. So that's not working. \n\nHmm. So maybe I need to re-examine my equations. \n\nWait, maybe my initial equation was wrong. Let me try again. \n\nOriginal number N = 100A + 10B + C. \n\nReverse number is 100C +10B + A. \n\nThe problem states that N - 495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo, 100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A \n\nSubtract the right side from both sides: \n\n100A +10B + C -495 -100C -10B -A =0 \n\nWhich simplifies to (100A -A) + (C -100C) + (10B -10B) -495 =0 \n\nSo 99A -99C -495 =0 \n\nWhich gives 99(A - C) =495 \n\nTherefore, A - C =495/99 =5. \n\nSo A = C +5. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nSo the hundreds digit is exactly 5 more than the units digit. \n\nSo let's see the options again. \n\nLooking at options, let's check for each the A and C digits. \n\nA) 368 \u2192 A=3, C=8 \u2192 3-8 is -5 \u2192 So A-C is -5, but the equation requires A -C =5. So this would not satisfy. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, in the equation, A - C =5. So in option A, the hundreds digit is 3, the units digit is 8. So 3-8 is -5, which would mean that the equation would have -5*99 = 495? Wait no, the equation is 99(A-C)=495 \u2192 A-C=5. So for option A, since 3-8 is -5, that would mean the left side is -495, but the equation requires 495. So that's why option A is invalid. \n\nAh! So my mistake earlier was assuming that A is the hundreds digit, so in option A, the hundreds digit is 3, and the units digit is 8. Therefore, A is 3, C is8. So A-C is negative. But the equation requires A -C =5, so that can't be. So option A can't be correct. \n\nHmm, so that's a problem. So I must have misread the options. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the options: \n\nA)368 \u2192 digits 3 (hundreds),6 (tens),8 (units). So A=3, C=8. \n\nB)377 \u2192 A=3, C=7. Then A-C= -4. \n\nC)288 \u2192 A=2, C=8 \u2192 A-C= -6 \n\nD)997 \u2192 A=9, C=7 \u2192 9-7=2 \u2192 Not 5. \n\nE)112 \u2192 A=1, C=2 \u2192 difference -1. \n\nSo none of the options have A -C equal to 5. Wait, that's a problem. Then perhaps I made an error in the equations? \n\nWait, let me re-examine the equation. \n\nThe equation was 99(A - C) =495 \u2192 so A -C =5. So the hundreds digit must be exactly 5 more than the units digit. \n\nLooking for numbers where A = C +5. \n\nLooking at the options given, none of them have that. So that's a problem. \n\nWait, so maybe the problem is not in the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me check the setup again. \n\nThe problem says: subtract 495 from the number, get the reverse. So N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo the reverse is a three-digit number. So N must be a three-digit number where when you subtract 495, you get another three-digit number. So N must be at least 495 + 100 (since reverse(N) must be three digits). So N must be between 595 and 999. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is 997, which is within that range. Let's see: \n\nD)997. \n\nA is 9, C is7. So A - C =2. Which is not 5, so equation not satisfied. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I messed up the equation. Let me re-derive it again. \n\nThe original number is N = 100A +10B + C. \n\nReverse is 100C +10B +A. \n\nSo N -495 = reverse \u2192 \n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B +A \n\nSubtract 10B from both sides: \n\n100A + C -495 = 100C + A \n\nBring variables to left: \n\n100A -A + C -100C -495 =0 \n\nWhich is 99A -99C -495 =0 \n\nSo same as before. \n\nThus, A - C =5. \n\nSo the hundreds digit must be exactly 5 more than the units digit. \n\nLooking at the options, none of them have A - C =5. \n\nWait, so that suggests that maybe there's a mistake in the problem's options, or I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows leading zeros in the reversed number? Like, if the original number is 100, then the reverse would be 001, but that's just 1. But the problem states \"a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order\". So leading zeros would make it not a three-digit number. So probably not. \n\nHmm. So perhaps I need to look beyond the options? But the options are given. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in considering the equations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when subtracting 495, the reversed number is not necessarily the same digits but the digits reversed in order. So perhaps the original number minus 495 equals the reverse of the original's digits, but perhaps the original's digits have to be three distinct digits? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the difference between N and reverse(N) is 495. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nWait, N - reverse(N) = 495. \n\nBecause N -495 = reverse \u2192 N - reverse =495. \n\nSo that difference is 495. \n\nLet me think of numbers where N - reverse(N) =495. \n\nWhat's the difference between a number and its reverse? For three-digit numbers, the difference is 99*(A - C). Because N - reverse(N) = (100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) =99A -99C =99(A -C). \n\nSo 99*(A-C)=495 \u2192 A-C =5. \n\nSo that's correct. So A must be C+5. \n\nTherefore, the hundreds digit must be 5 more than the units digit. \n\nLooking at the options, none of them have that. \n\nWait, but the options given must have the correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in checking the options? Let me check again each option's digits. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. \n\nOptions:\n\nA)368 \u2192 digits 3,6,8 \u2192 A=3, C=8 \u2192 A - C = -5 \n\nB)377 \u21923,7,7 \u2192 A=3, C=7 \u2192 difference -4 \n\nC)288 \u2192 2,8,8 \u2192 A=2, C=8 \u2192 difference -6 \n\nD)997 \u21929,9,7 \u2192 difference 2 \n\nE)112 \u21921,1,2 \u2192 difference -1 \n\nHmm, none of these have A-C =5. \n\nWait, so that suggests that perhaps the problem is not from the options given? Or maybe I made an error in calculation for one of the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the problem might have a different interpretation. \n\nWait, the question says \"the sum of the digits is 17\". Let me check again the options for that. \n\nOption B:377: 3+7+7=17. That's correct. \n\nSum of squares: 3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe problem requires sum of squares to be 109. So that's 2 less. \n\nSo perhaps the correct number is not among the options, but that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the equations. Let me see. \n\nLet me think of another approach. Let me suppose the correct number is not given here, but maybe the options have a typo. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check all possibilities where A = C+5, and then see which of those numbers are in the options. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nSuppose A = C +5. \n\nPossible digits for C can be from 0 to 4 (since A is a digit between 0-9, but since it's the hundreds digit, A must be at least 1). \n\nSo possible C values: 0,1,2,3,4. \n\nThus, possible A values would be 5,6,7,8,9. \n\nSo the possible pairs (A,C) are (5,0), (6,1), (7,2), (8,3), (9,4). \n\nNow, the sum of the digits is A+B+C=17. Since A = C+5, then substituting: \n\n(C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B +5 =17 \u2192 2C + B =12. \n\nAlso, the sum of squares is A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109. \n\nSubstituting A = C+5: \n\n(C+5)^2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\nExpand (C+5)^2: C\u00b2 +10C +25 \n\nSo total equation: C\u00b2 +10C +25 + B\u00b2 +C\u00b2 =109 \u2192 2C\u00b2 +10C +25 + B\u00b2 =109 \n\nThus, 2C\u00b2 +10C + B\u00b2 =84 \n\nNow, since 2C + B =12 \u2192 B =12 -2C \n\nSubstitute B into the equation: \n\n2C\u00b2 +10C + (12-2C)^2 =84 \n\nLet me compute (12-2C)^2 = 144 -48C +4C\u00b2 \n\nSo the equation becomes: \n\n2C\u00b2 +10C +144 -48C +4C\u00b2 =84 \n\nCombine like terms: \n\n(2C\u00b2 +4C\u00b2) + (10C -48C) +144 =84 \n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +144 =84 \n\nSubtract 84: \n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0 \n\nDivide equation by 2: \n\n3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0 \n\nHmm, let's solve this quadratic equation for C. \n\nThe quadratic is 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0 \n\nUsing quadratic formula: C = [19 \u00b1 sqrt(361 - 360)]/(6) \n\nBecause discriminant D= (19)^2 -4*3*30 = 361 -360 =1 \n\nThus sqrt(1)=1 \n\nSo C = [19 \u00b11]/6 \u2192 \n\nPossible solutions: \n\n(19+1)/6 =20/6 \u22483.333\u2026 Not an integer. \n\n(19-1)/6 =18/6 =3 \n\nAh! So C=3 is a solution. \n\nThus, C=3. \n\nSo then, since A = C +5 \u2192 A=8 \n\nThen B =12 -2C =12 -6 =6 \n\nTherefore the digits are A=8, B=6, C=3. \n\nSo the number is 863. \n\nWait, but 863 is not among the options. The options given are 368, 377, 288, 997, 112. \n\nHmm, so that's a problem. The computed number is 863, which isn't an option. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again the equations. \n\nLet me verify the calculation steps again. \n\nStarting from the equations:\n\nSum of digits: A + B + C =17 \n\nA = C +5 \n\nSo substituting: (C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B =12-2C \n\nSum of squares: (C+5)^2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\nExpanding (C+5)^2: C\u00b2 +10C +25 \n\nSo total equation: \n\nC\u00b2+10C+25 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\n\u2192 2C\u00b2 +10C +25 + B\u00b2 =109 \n\n\u2192 2C\u00b2 +10C + B\u00b2 =84 \n\nSubstituting B=12-2C: \n\n2C\u00b2 +10C + (12-2C)^2 =84 \n\nExpanding (12-2C)^2: 144 -48C +4C\u00b2 \n\nSo equation becomes: \n\n2C\u00b2 +10C +144 -48C +4C\u00b2 =84 \n\nCombine terms:\n\n2C\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2 \n\n10C -48C =-38C \n\nSo 6C\u00b2 -38C +144 =84 \n\nSubtract 84: 6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0 \n\nDivide by 2: 3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0 \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSolutions: C=(19\u00b11)/6 \u2192 3.333 or 3. So C=3 is the integer solution. \n\nSo with C=3, then A=8, B=6. \n\nSo the number is 863. \n\nHmm, so that's not in the options. So either the options are wrong, or I missed something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe problem says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. So 863 -495 = 368. Which is the reverse of 863? Wait, reverse of 863 is 368. So yes, 863-495=368. That works. \n\nBut 368 is option A. Wait, but earlier when I checked option A, I thought the sum of digits is 3+6+8=17, which is correct. Sum of squares: 9+36+64=109. Which matches. \n\nWait, but then why did I think option A was invalid earlier? Because when I subtract 495 from 368 (the option A's number) I get a negative number. But wait the correct number is 863, not 368. \n\nAh! Here's the mistake! I must have confused the original number with the reversed one. \n\nThe problem states that the original number minus 495 equals the reversed number. So the original number is 863, subtract 495 gives 368, which is the reverse. So 863 is the correct number. \n\nBut 863 is not one of the options. The options given are A)368, B)377, etc. \n\nHmm. That's a problem. Because according to the calculations, the correct number should be 863, which is not listed. \n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option A is 368. Which is the reverse of the correct number. \n\nWait, so maybe I mixed up the original and reversed number? \n\nWait the problem says: subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So original number is N, then N -495 = reversed(N). So N is the original, and reversed is the result. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, which when subtracted by 495 gives 368 (its reverse). \n\nBut since 863 is not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's conditions. Let me check again the sum of digits and squares. \n\nOriginal number 863: digits 8+6+3=17. Sum of squares: 64+36+9=109. So that's correct. \n\nSo the problem's options must have a typo or I misread them. Wait let me check the options again. \n\nThe options given are:\n\nA)368\n\nB)377\n\nC)288\n\nD)997\n\nE)112\n\nHmm. None of them is 863. Wait, but option A is 368, which is the reverse. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem was to find the reversed number? No, the problem says \"Find the number.\" So the original number is 863, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let me try with another possible C. The quadratic had another solution of C=20/6 \u22483.333, which is not an integer. So only C=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me see. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the squares of its digits is 109\". For 863, that's correct. \n\nHmm, but since the options don't have that, maybe I have to see which of the given options, when considered as the original number, might satisfy the conditions. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the first step. Let me try another approach. Let me check each of the options again, but this time carefully. \n\nStarting with option A: 368. \n\nSum of digits:3+6+8=17 \u2714\ufe0f \n\nSum of squares: 9+36+64=109 \u2714\ufe0f \n\nNow, the reverse of 368 is 863. \n\nSubtracting 495 from 368 gives 368-495 = -127, which is not 863. So that condition fails. \n\nBut the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So the reverse should be 368 -495 = -127, which is not the case. \n\nWait, but the correct number is 863, which is not an option. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem requires that subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse, so perhaps the original number is 863, but it's not in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me see. \n\nWait, let me check the equations again. \n\nWe had for C=3, so the number is 8 (hundreds), 6 (tens), 3 (units). \n\n8+6+3=17 \u2714\ufe0f \n\n8\u00b2+6\u00b2+3\u00b2=64+36+9=109 \u2714\ufe0f \n\n863-495=368, which is the reverse. \n\nSo that's all correct. \n\nHmm. The problem's options don't include 863. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's reading. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109.\" \n\nSo the number 863 meets those. \n\nThe reverse is 368, and 863-495=368. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863. \n\nBut since it's not an option, perhaps the options have a mistake. Or maybe I missed an option. \n\nWait the options are given as A to E. Let me check again. \n\nOptions are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe there is another possible solution. \n\nWait the quadratic equation had C=3, but what if there are other possibilities? Let me see. \n\nWait, the quadratic equation had only C=3 as integer solution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. \n\nWait let me try C=4. \n\nWait, let's see. Suppose I didn't solve the equation properly. Let me see another way. \n\nSuppose A = C +5. \n\nWe can try possible values for C from 0 to 4, compute B from 2C + B =12 \u2192 B=12-2C. \n\nThen check if the sum of squares equals 109. \n\nLet me try each possible C:\n\nC=0 \u2192 A=5, B=12. But B must be a single digit (0-9). 12 is invalid. \n\nC=1 \u2192 A=6, B=10 \u2192 B=10 invalid. \n\nC=2 \u2192 A=7, B=8. \n\nThen sum of squares: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = 7\u00b2 +8\u00b2 +2\u00b2 =49+64+4=117. Not 109. \n\nC=3 \u2192 A=8, B=6 \u2192 squares:64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nC=4 \u2192 A=9, B=4. \n\nSum of squares: 81 +16 +16 = 113. Not 109. \n\nSo only C=3 gives the correct sum of squares. \n\nThus, the only possible number is 863, which is not in the options. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's statement. \n\nWait the problem says subtract 495 from the number, get the reverse. So original number is N, so N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nThus N = reverse(N) +495. \n\nSo for option A:368, reverse is 863 \u2192 863+495=1358. Not a three-digit number. \n\nOption B:377. Reverse is 773. 773 +495 =1268. Not three-digit. \n\nOption C:288 \u2192 reverse 882 \u2192 882+495=1377. \n\nOption D:997 \u2192 reverse 799 \u2192 799+495=1294. \n\nOption E:112 \u2192 reverse 211 \u2192 211+495=706. \n\nNone of these give the original number. \n\nSo none of the options satisfy the condition. \n\nHmm. But that's impossible because the problem must have an answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me try another approach. \n\nSuppose the original number is N, and the reverse is M. \n\nGiven that N - M =495 \n\nAlso, sum of digits of N is 17. \n\nSum of squares of digits of N is 109. \n\nWe can also note that N - M = 99*(A -C). So 99*(A-C)=495 \u2192 A-C=5. \n\nSo A =C+5. \n\nWe also have A+B+C=17 \u2192 B=17 -A -C \u2192 substituting A=C+5 gives B=17 - (C+5) -C =12-2C. \n\nSum of squares: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2=109. \n\nSubstituting A and B gives (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\nLet me expand this again carefully. \n\n(C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25 \n\n(12-2C)^2 = 144 -48C +4C\u00b2 \n\nC\u00b2 is C\u00b2 \n\nAdding all terms: \n\nC\u00b2+10C+25 +144-48C+4C\u00b2 + C\u00b2 \n\nTotal: (1C\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +1C\u00b2) + (10C -48C) + (25+144) \n\nSo 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 \n\nSet equal to 109: \n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109 \n\nSubtract 109: \n\n6C\u00b2-38C +60 =0 \u2192 same equation as before. \n\nSo yeah, same result. So C=3. \n\nThus, the number is 863. \n\nHmm, so the problem's options must be wrong. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's reading. \n\nWait, maybe the question says subtract the number from 495? Like 495 - N = reversed(N). \n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \n\n\"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\"\n\nNo, it's N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a different interpretation. For instance, the number minus 495 is equal to the reverse of the original number. So the reverse is a three-digit number, so N must be at least 495 +100 = 595. \n\nLooking at the options given, only D (997) and A (368) are above 500? Wait 368 is below 500. \n\nWait 997 is the only one over 500. \n\nWait 997 -495 = 502. \n\nReverse of 997 is 799. 502 vs 799. Not equal. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, not necessarily N - reverse(N)=495. \n\nWait, if N - reverse(N)=495, then that's what I did. \n\nAlternatively, reverse(N) - N =495. \n\nIf that's the case, then reverse(N) = N +495. \n\nThen, for option A: reverse(368)=863 \u2192 863-368=495. Oh! That's exactly 495. \n\nAh! Wait a second! Maybe I had the subtraction reversed. \n\nThe problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\", which is N -495 equals the reverse. \n\nBut if the reverse is larger than N, then N -495 would be negative, but the reverse is a positive number. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that when you subtract the number from 495, you get the reverse? That would be 495 - N = reverse(N). But that would give a negative number for N greater than 495. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, regardless of order. \n\nIn that case, either N - reverse(N)=495 or reverse(N) - N=495. \n\nIf it's the latter, then for option A: reverse(N) - N =863-368=495. Which matches. \n\nSo the problem might have meant that the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, but didn't specify the order. \n\nBut the problem's wording is: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" \n\nSo that would mean N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nBut in the case of option A: 368-495= -127, which is not the reverse. \n\nHowever, if reverse(N) - N =495 \u2192 863-368=495. Which would mean that reverse(N) = N +495. \n\nSo the problem might have a wording mistake. If the correct equation is reverse(N) = N -495, then that would be N - reverse(N)=495, which requires N being larger. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the reverse is obtained by subtracting 495, but in that case, the correct number would have to be larger than 495, and the reverse being smaller. \n\nWait the correct number according to our calculation is 863. \n\n863 -495 = 368, which is its reverse. \n\nSo that is exactly what the problem states. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, which is not among the options. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, looking back at the options again, option A is 368. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is a trick question where the number is 368, but when you subtract 495, you get the reverse (which is 863), but the problem says \"we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order\". \n\nWait, 368's reverse is 863, which is different digits? No, the digits are the same, just reversed. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the same digits written in the reverse order\". So 368's digits are 3,6,8, and the reverse is 8,6,3, which are the same digits. \n\nSo the problem's wording allows that. \n\nBut the equation would require that N -495 equals the reverse. \n\n368-495 is -127, which is not the reverse. \n\nThus, that can't be. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's options, and the correct answer should be 863, which is not listed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum of squares for one of the options. \n\nWait, let me recheck option D: 997. \n\nSum of digits:9+9+7=25. Not 17. So no. \n\nOption B:377. Sum is 17, sum of squares 107. \n\nOption C:288 sum is 18. \n\nOption E:112 sum is4. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's first condition. \n\nWait, let me check option B:377. \n\nSum of digits is 3+7+7=17. \n\nSum of squares: 9+49+49=107. \n\nClose to 109, but off by 2. \n\nMaybe there's a typo and the correct number is 377, but the sum of squares should be 107. Or the problem states 109. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 863 but it's not listed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me check again. \n\nThe quadratic was 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0. \n\nSolution C=(19\u00b1\u221a(361-360))/6 \u2192 sqrt(1) is 1, so (19+1)/6=20/6\u22483.333, and (19-1)/6=18/6=3. \n\nYes, so C=3 is the only integer solution. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution steps. \n\nWait, let me try C=4 again. \n\nWait, with C=4, then A=9, B=4 (since B=12-2*4=4). \n\nSum of digits:9+4+4=17. \n\nSum of squares:81 +16 +16 = 113. \n\nHmm. Not 109. \n\nC=2: A=7, B=8. \n\nSum of digits:7+8+2=17. \n\nSum of squares:49+64+4=117. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo only C=3 gives the correct sum of squares. \n\nThus, I think the problem's options are incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the squares of its digits is 109\". \n\nThe number 863's digits squared sum to 64+36+9=109. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps there is an option that I misread. Let me check again: \n\nOptions are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo in option A. Like maybe it's 863 instead of 368? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. Let me list all possible three-digit numbers where A = C +5, and digits sum to 17. \n\nSo A = C+5. \n\nPossible C from 0-4. \n\nFor each C from 0-4, compute A and B such that A + B + C =17 \u2192 B=12-2C. \n\nThen check sum of squares. \n\nC=0: A=5, B=12 \u2192 invalid (B must be single-digit). \n\nC=1: A=6, B=10 \u2192 invalid. \n\nC=2: A=7, B=8 \u2192 digits 7,8,2 \u2192 sum squares 49+64+4=117. \n\nC=3: A=8, B=6 \u2192 8,6,3 \u2192 sum squares 109. \n\nC=4: A=9, B=4 \u2192 digits 9,4,4 \u2192 sum squares 81+16+16=113. \n\nOnly C=3 gives the correct sum of squares. \n\nThus, the number is 863. \n\nTherefore, the problem's options are incorrect. \n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe I made an error in the problem's first condition. \n\nWait the problem says the sum of the digits is 17. \n\nThe number 863 has digits summing to 17. \n\nThe options given have option A's digits sum to 17. \n\nSo the only possible option that satisfies the first two conditions (sum and sum of squares) is option A, but it fails the subtraction condition. \n\nAlternatively, the problem may have a different interpretation of the digits. \n\nWait, maybe the digits are allowed to be in any order, but not necessarily the same digits. \n\nNo, the problem states \"the same digits written in the reverse order\". \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction step. \n\nWait, let me try the number 368 again. \n\n368 minus 495 is indeed -127. Which is not the reverse. \n\nThe reverse is 863, which is 368's reverse. \n\nThus, the problem's correct answer is not among the options, which is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nOption B is 377. \n\nSum of digits:17. \n\nSum of squares:3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107. \n\nClose to 109. \n\nIf the problem had a typo and the sum of squares is 107, then option B would work. \n\nBut the problem states 109. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in the problem's options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's check option B:377. \n\nThe reverse would be 773. \n\n377-495= -118, which is not 773. \n\nSo that's not valid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C:288. \n\nDigits sum to 18. No. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, but in absolute terms. \n\nThe difference between 863 and 368 is 495. \n\nThus, the absolute difference is 495. \n\nSo the problem may have meant that the absolute difference is 495. \n\nIn that case, the correct number is 863, but since it's not an option, perhaps the answer is option A, as the reverse. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\" to get the reverse. \n\nSo the only number that fits all conditions is 863, but it's not listed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. \n\nWait, let me try solving for B and C again. \n\nWe have:\n\nA = C+5 \n\nA + B + C =17 \u2192 B = 12-2C \n\nSum of squares: (C+5)^2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\nSubstituting B:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\nLet me compute this for C=3: \n\n(3+5)^2 =8\u00b2=64 \n\n(12-6)^2=6\u00b2=36 \n\nC\u00b2=9 \n\nTotal:64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nC=3 is correct. \n\nThus, I think the problem's options are incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where the options are different, and there's a typo here. \n\nGiven that in the options provided, the only number that meets the sum and sum of squares is option A (368), but it doesn't meet the subtraction condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a different condition. \n\nWait, maybe the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, and the correct number is 863, but since it's not an option, maybe the question expects us to choose the reverse, which is option A. \n\nEven though technically it doesn't satisfy the subtraction condition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but there's a miscalculation. \n\nWait let's check option B again. \n\n377. \n\nSum of digits is 3+7+7=17. \n\nSum of squares:9+49+49=107. \n\nClose but not 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's condition. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the squares of its digits is 109\". \n\nIf the number is 368, then that's 3\u00b2+6\u00b2+8\u00b2=9+36+64=109. That's correct. \n\nWait a second! Wait, 368's sum of squares is indeed 109. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem requires that when you subtract 495 from the number, you get the reverse. \n\nFor 368, subtracting 495 gives -127, which is not the reverse. \n\nBut the reverse of 368 is 863, which is exactly 368+495=863. \n\nAh! Wait! Maybe the problem says \"subtract the number from 495\" instead of the other way around. \n\nIf that were the case, then 495 - 368 = 127, which is not the reverse. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the reverse of the number to be 495 less than the original number. \n\nWait, that's what I thought. \n\nOriginal number N = 368. \n\nReverse is 863. \n\n863 is 495 more than 368. \n\nThus, N +495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo the equation would be N +495 = reverse(N). \n\nWhich would mean that the reverse is larger. \n\nSo that equation would be: \n\nN +495 = reverse(N) \u2192 reverse(N) - N =495 \n\nWhich is exactly what happens with 368 and 863. \n\nThus, if the problem had said \"add 495 to the number to get the reverse\", then option A would be correct. \n\nBut the problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\". \n\nAh! That's the key. \n\nThe problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\" to get the reverse. \n\nSo N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nWhich would require that N is larger than the reverse by 495. \n\nThus, for the correct number 863, this holds because 863-495=368 (reverse). \n\nThus, the correct number is 863. \n\nBut since it's not an option, perhaps the problem had a typo and the options include 863, but here it's listed as option A as 368. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different answer. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first condition. \n\nWait, let me check option B:377. \n\nIf the number is 377, then subtracting 495 gives -118, which is not the reverse. \n\nThe reverse of 377 is 773. \n\nThus, 377-495 =-118 !=773. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B, but with a different calculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake and the correct answer is option A. \n\nEven though the subtraction doesn't work, perhaps the other conditions are met. \n\nBut the problem requires all three conditions. \n\nThus, perhaps the options are wrong. \n\nGiven that, in the absence of the correct option, but the closest is option A, but it doesn't satisfy the third condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, let me re-express the equation for option A. \n\nIf N is 368, then reverse is 863. \n\nIf N -495 = reverse \u2192 368 -495 = -127, which is not 863. \n\nBut if the problem requires that reverse(N) - N =495 \u2192 863-368=495, which is correct. \n\nThus, if the problem's equation is reversed, then option A is correct. \n\nPerhaps the problem has a typo in the wording. \n\nIf the problem said \"if we subtract the number from 495, we get the reverse\", then 495 - N = reverse(N). \n\nBut that would require N= 495 - reverse(N). \n\nFor option A:495-368=127, which is not the reverse (863). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says \"the difference between the number and its reverse is 495\", then option A would be valid because the difference between 863 and 368 is 495. \n\nBut the problem's wording specifies subtracting 495 from the number to get the reverse. \n\nGiven that, and the options provided, there's no correct answer. \n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question with options given, and the only option that satisfies the first two conditions (sum and sum of squares) is option A. \n\nPerhaps the problem intended the difference between the number and its reverse to be 495, so the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, even though the subtraction condition is technically not met, the problem might have a wording error, and the answer expected is A. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is A, and I made a mistake in thinking that the subtraction must give the reverse, but the problem might allow negative numbers. \n\nWait, the problem says \"a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order\". \n\nThe reverse of 368 is 863, which is a different number. \n\nSubtracting 495 gives -127, which is not 863. \n\nThus, it's not the reverse. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the digits of the result are the reverse, ignoring the negative sign. \n\nBut -127's digits are 1,2,7, which are not the same as 3,6,8. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven the options provided, the only one that meets the first two conditions is A. \n\nPerhaps the question has an error, but since I have to choose from the options, I'll go with option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for option B. \n\nWait let me check option B again. \n\nOption B:377. \n\nSum of digits:3+7+7=17. \n\nSum of squares:9+49+49=107. \n\nClose but not 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B, but the sum of squares was a miscalculation. \n\nWait 3 squared is 9, 7 squared is 49, 7 squared is 49. 9+49=58 +49=107. Yes. \n\nThus, no. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation for the reverse. \n\nWait, the reverse of the number must be three digits. \n\nFor option A's reverse is 863, which is three digits. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, but it's not an option. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the question had a mistake and the correct answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I'll choose option A as the answer, even though it doesn't satisfy the subtraction condition. \n\nWait, but that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem had a different number. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. \n\nWait, let me see if there are other solutions where A -C =5. \n\nWait, perhaps the equation has another solution if B is allowed to be a two-digit number? \n\nNo, B must be a single digit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's first condition. \n\nWait, the problem says \"three-digit number\". \n\nThus, I think the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different sum of squares. \n\nIf the sum of squares is 107, then option B would be correct. \n\nBut the problem states 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and the problem's subtraction condition is a trick. \n\nWait, maybe when you subtract 495 from the number, you get a number with the same digits in reverse order, but ignoring the negative sign. \n\nSo 368-495 =-127. \n\nThe absolute value is 127, which has digits 1,2,7. Not the same as 3,6,8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different intended answer. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me list all three-digit numbers where A = C+5 and sum of digits is 17. \n\nPossible C from 0-4: \n\nC=0 \u2192 A=5, B=12 \u2192 invalid. \n\nC=1 \u2192 A=6, B=10 \u2192 invalid. \n\nC=2 \u2192 A=7, B=8 \u2192 digits 7,8,2 \u2192 number 782. \n\nSum of squares:49+64+4=117. \n\nC=3 \u2192 A=8,B=6 \u2192 863 \u2192 sum squares 109. \n\nC=4 \u2192 A=9,B=4 \u2192 944 \u2192 sum squares 81+16+16=113. \n\nThus, only 863 fits all conditions. \n\nThus, the answer is not among the options. \n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question, the intended answer is likely A)368, as it meets the first two conditions, and the subtraction condition might have been a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reverse calculation. \n\nWait, perhaps the reverse is not of the original number, but of the result after subtraction? \n\nNo, the problem says \"we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order\". \n\nThus, the result must be the reverse of the original's digits. \n\nGiven that, the only possible answer is 863. \n\nBut since it's not an option, I'm forced to choose from the given options. \n\nPerhaps the problem had a different number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B, but with a different interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. \n\nWait, let me recheck the quadratic equation. \n\nThe equation was 3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0. \n\nWait, 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 factors as (3C -10)(C-3) = 0? \n\nLet me check: \n\n(3C-10)(C-3) =3C\u00b2-9C -10C+30=3C\u00b2-19C+30. Yes. \n\nThus, roots are C=10/3 or C=3. \n\nSo C=3 is the only integer solution. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863. \n\nThus, the problem's options are incorrect. \n\nSince I must choose from the given options, perhaps there's an error in the problem's options, and the closest possible is option A. \n\nTherefore, I'll choose option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first calculation. \n\nWait, the problem's third condition: subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. \n\nThe number is 863 \u2192 863-495=368, which is the reverse. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, which is not an option. \n\nGiven that, and the options provided, I think the problem might have a mistake. But since I must choose from the options given, perhaps the correct answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a different source where the options are correct, and I misread them. \n\nWait, looking again at the options: \n\nA)368 \n\nB)377 \n\nC)288 \n\nD)997 \n\nE)112 \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nLet me try with the number 368. \n\nThe sum of digits is 17, sum of squares is 109. \n\nThe reverse is 863. \n\nIf the problem had said \"adding 495 to the number gives the reverse\", then 368+495=863, which is correct. \n\nThus, perhaps the problem had a typo and said \"add\" instead of \"subtract\". \n\nIf that's the case, then the answer is A. \n\nGiven that the problem's wording says \"subtract\", but if there's a typo, then A is correct. \n\nGiven that the options are provided and the problem's answer is likely A if there's a typo, I'll choose option A. \n\nSo the answer is A.\n",

Given the options, **A** is the closest valid answer despite the subtraction discrepancy.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a three-digit number. Let's see what the question says again. The sum of the digits is 17, the sum of their squares is 109, and when you subtract 495 from the number, you get the reverse of the original number. The options are given as A to E. Hmm, I need to find which one of these numbers fits all the conditions. \n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. Let me start by denoting the three-digit number as ABC, where A is the hundreds digit, B is the tens, and C is the units digit. So the actual number is 100A + 10B + C. When we subtract 495 from this number, the result should be CBA, which is 100C + 10B + A. So the equation would be:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\n\nHmm, let's rearrange that equation. Subtract the right side from both sides to get:\n\n100A + 10B + C - 495 - 100C -10B -A =0 \n\nSimplify terms: (100A - A) + (10B -10B) + (C -100C) -495 =0 \n\nThat becomes 99A -99C -495 =0 \n\nFactor out 99: 99(A - C) =495 \n\nDivide both sides by 99: A - C = 495/99. Wait, 495 divided by 99. Let me compute that. 99*5 is 495, right? Because 100*5 is 500, minus 5 is 495. So 99*5=495. So then A - C =5. \n\nSo that's one equation: A = C +5. \n\nOkay, so the hundreds digit is 5 more than the units digit. Got that. \n\nNow, the sum of the digits is 17. So A + B + C =17. \n\nAnd the sum of the squares is 109: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109. \n\nSo now, I need to find digits A, B, C such that these equations hold, and also when subtracting 495, the reversed number is formed. \n\nSince the options are given, maybe it's easier to check each option against these conditions. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's list the options:\n\nA) 368 \u2192 digits 3,6,8\n\nB) 377 \u2192 3,7,7\n\nC)288 \u21922,8,8\n\nD)997 \u21929,9,7\n\nE)112 \u21921,1,2\n\nWait, but let me check each one step by step. \n\nStarting with option A: 368. Let's check the conditions. \n\nFirst, sum of digits: 3+6+8 =17? 3+6 is 9, plus 8 is 17. Yes, that's good. \n\nSum of squares: 3\u00b2 +6\u00b2 +8\u00b2 =9 +36 +64 = 109. 9+36 is 45, plus 64 is 109. Perfect, that's correct. \n\nNow the third condition: subtracting 495. Let's compute 368 -495. Wait, that would be a negative number. But the problem says subtracting 495 gives the reverse. The reverse of 368 is 863. But 368 is smaller than 495, so 368-495 would be negative, but the reverse is 863, which is positive. So that can't be. So A is invalid. \n\nHmm, so A is out. \n\nNext, option B: 377. \n\nSum of digits: 3+7+7 =17? 3+7 is 10, plus 7 is 17. Yes. \n\nSum of squares: 3\u00b2 +7\u00b2 +7\u00b2 =9 +49 +49 = 9+98=107. Wait, 107? But the problem states the sum of squares should be 109. So that's 2 less. So B is out. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption C:288. Digits 2,8,8. \n\nSum: 2+8+8 =18, which is more than 17. So that's already invalid. So C is out. \n\nOption D:997. Digits 9,9,7. \n\nSum:9+9+7=25. Not 17. So no. \n\nOption E:112. Sum is 1+1+2=4. Nope. \n\nHmm, so none of the options except A and B passed the first two conditions. Wait, but A failed the third condition. Let me check B again. Wait B's sum was 17, but sum of squares was 107 instead of 109. \n\nWait, so maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recheck B's sum of squares. \n\nB is 3,7,7. So 3 squared is 9, 7 squared is 49, another 49. 9+49 is 58, plus 49 is 107. Yeah, that's right. So that's not 109. So that's a problem. \n\nHmm, so maybe none of the options except A and B pass the first two conditions, but A fails the third. Wait, so maybe I made an error in considering the equations. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says when you subtract 495 from the number, you get the reverse. Let me check for option A again. \n\nOriginal number is 368. Subtracting 495 gives 368 -495 = -127. The reverse of 368 is 863. But -127 is not equal to 863. So that's not right. So A is invalid. \n\nHmm. So none of the options are valid? That can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check my equations again. \n\nWait, the problem says subtract 495 from the number and get the reverse. The reverse is a three-digit number. So if the original number is ABC, then the reverse is CBA. So the equation is ABC - 495 = CBA. \n\nTherefore, ABC - CBA = 495. \n\nWait, so ABC must be larger than CBA by exactly 495. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up the equation properly. Let me do that again. \n\nLet me denote the original number as N = 100A +10B + C. \n\nThen N - 495 = 100C +10B + A. \n\nTherefore, rearranged: \n\nN - (reverse of N) = 495. \n\nSo N - reverse(N) = 495. \n\nHmm, so perhaps N is larger than reverse(N) by 495. \n\nLet me compute for option A: 368 - 863 = -495. So 368 - 863 = -495, so 368 = 863 -495. But the question says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So 368 -495 would be -127, which is not the reverse. So that's not working. \n\nHmm. So maybe I need to re-examine my equations. \n\nWait, maybe my initial equation was wrong. Let me try again. \n\nOriginal number N = 100A + 10B + C. \n\nReverse number is 100C +10B + A. \n\nThe problem states that N - 495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo, 100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B + A \n\nSubtract the right side from both sides: \n\n100A +10B + C -495 -100C -10B -A =0 \n\nWhich simplifies to (100A -A) + (C -100C) + (10B -10B) -495 =0 \n\nSo 99A -99C -495 =0 \n\nWhich gives 99(A - C) =495 \n\nTherefore, A - C =495/99 =5. \n\nSo A = C +5. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nSo the hundreds digit is exactly 5 more than the units digit. \n\nSo let's see the options again. \n\nLooking at options, let's check for each the A and C digits. \n\nA) 368 \u2192 A=3, C=8 \u2192 3-8 is -5 \u2192 So A-C is -5, but the equation requires A -C =5. So this would not satisfy. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, in the equation, A - C =5. So in option A, the hundreds digit is 3, the units digit is 8. So 3-8 is -5, which would mean that the equation would have -5*99 = 495? Wait no, the equation is 99(A-C)=495 \u2192 A-C=5. So for option A, since 3-8 is -5, that would mean the left side is -495, but the equation requires 495. So that's why option A is invalid. \n\nAh! So my mistake earlier was assuming that A is the hundreds digit, so in option A, the hundreds digit is 3, and the units digit is 8. Therefore, A is 3, C is8. So A-C is negative. But the equation requires A -C =5, so that can't be. So option A can't be correct. \n\nHmm, so that's a problem. So I must have misread the options. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the options: \n\nA)368 \u2192 digits 3 (hundreds),6 (tens),8 (units). So A=3, C=8. \n\nB)377 \u2192 A=3, C=7. Then A-C= -4. \n\nC)288 \u2192 A=2, C=8 \u2192 A-C= -6 \n\nD)997 \u2192 A=9, C=7 \u2192 9-7=2 \u2192 Not 5. \n\nE)112 \u2192 A=1, C=2 \u2192 difference -1. \n\nSo none of the options have A -C equal to 5. Wait, that's a problem. Then perhaps I made an error in the equations? \n\nWait, let me re-examine the equation. \n\nThe equation was 99(A - C) =495 \u2192 so A -C =5. So the hundreds digit must be exactly 5 more than the units digit. \n\nLooking for numbers where A = C +5. \n\nLooking at the options given, none of them have that. So that's a problem. \n\nWait, so maybe the problem is not in the options, but perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me check the setup again. \n\nThe problem says: subtract 495 from the number, get the reverse. So N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo the reverse is a three-digit number. So N must be a three-digit number where when you subtract 495, you get another three-digit number. So N must be at least 495 + 100 (since reverse(N) must be three digits). So N must be between 595 and 999. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is 997, which is within that range. Let's see: \n\nD)997. \n\nA is 9, C is7. So A - C =2. Which is not 5, so equation not satisfied. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I messed up the equation. Let me re-derive it again. \n\nThe original number is N = 100A +10B + C. \n\nReverse is 100C +10B +A. \n\nSo N -495 = reverse \u2192 \n\n100A +10B + C -495 = 100C +10B +A \n\nSubtract 10B from both sides: \n\n100A + C -495 = 100C + A \n\nBring variables to left: \n\n100A -A + C -100C -495 =0 \n\nWhich is 99A -99C -495 =0 \n\nSo same as before. \n\nThus, A - C =5. \n\nSo the hundreds digit must be exactly 5 more than the units digit. \n\nLooking at the options, none of them have A - C =5. \n\nWait, so that suggests that maybe there's a mistake in the problem's options, or I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem allows leading zeros in the reversed number? Like, if the original number is 100, then the reverse would be 001, but that's just 1. But the problem states \"a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order\". So leading zeros would make it not a three-digit number. So probably not. \n\nHmm. So perhaps I need to look beyond the options? But the options are given. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in considering the equations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when subtracting 495, the reversed number is not necessarily the same digits but the digits reversed in order. So perhaps the original number minus 495 equals the reverse of the original's digits, but perhaps the original's digits have to be three distinct digits? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the difference between N and reverse(N) is 495. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nWait, N - reverse(N) = 495. \n\nBecause N -495 = reverse \u2192 N - reverse =495. \n\nSo that difference is 495. \n\nLet me think of numbers where N - reverse(N) =495. \n\nWhat's the difference between a number and its reverse? For three-digit numbers, the difference is 99*(A - C). Because N - reverse(N) = (100A +10B +C) - (100C +10B +A) =99A -99C =99(A -C). \n\nSo 99*(A-C)=495 \u2192 A-C =5. \n\nSo that's correct. So A must be C+5. \n\nTherefore, the hundreds digit must be 5 more than the units digit. \n\nLooking at the options, none of them have that. \n\nWait, but the options given must have the correct answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in checking the options? Let me check again each option's digits. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. \n\nOptions:\n\nA)368 \u2192 digits 3,6,8 \u2192 A=3, C=8 \u2192 A - C = -5 \n\nB)377 \u21923,7,7 \u2192 A=3, C=7 \u2192 difference -4 \n\nC)288 \u2192 2,8,8 \u2192 A=2, C=8 \u2192 difference -6 \n\nD)997 \u21929,9,7 \u2192 difference 2 \n\nE)112 \u21921,1,2 \u2192 difference -1 \n\nHmm, none of these have A-C =5. \n\nWait, so that suggests that perhaps the problem is not from the options given? Or maybe I made an error in calculation for one of the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the problem might have a different interpretation. \n\nWait, the question says \"the sum of the digits is 17\". Let me check again the options for that. \n\nOption B:377: 3+7+7=17. That's correct. \n\nSum of squares: 3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe problem requires sum of squares to be 109. So that's 2 less. \n\nSo perhaps the correct number is not among the options, but that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the equations. Let me see. \n\nLet me think of another approach. Let me suppose the correct number is not given here, but maybe the options have a typo. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check all possibilities where A = C+5, and then see which of those numbers are in the options. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nSuppose A = C +5. \n\nPossible digits for C can be from 0 to 4 (since A is a digit between 0-9, but since it's the hundreds digit, A must be at least 1). \n\nSo possible C values: 0,1,2,3,4. \n\nThus, possible A values would be 5,6,7,8,9. \n\nSo the possible pairs (A,C) are (5,0), (6,1), (7,2), (8,3), (9,4). \n\nNow, the sum of the digits is A+B+C=17. Since A = C+5, then substituting: \n\n(C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B +5 =17 \u2192 2C + B =12. \n\nAlso, the sum of squares is A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109. \n\nSubstituting A = C+5: \n\n(C+5)^2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\nExpand (C+5)^2: C\u00b2 +10C +25 \n\nSo total equation: C\u00b2 +10C +25 + B\u00b2 +C\u00b2 =109 \u2192 2C\u00b2 +10C +25 + B\u00b2 =109 \n\nThus, 2C\u00b2 +10C + B\u00b2 =84 \n\nNow, since 2C + B =12 \u2192 B =12 -2C \n\nSubstitute B into the equation: \n\n2C\u00b2 +10C + (12-2C)^2 =84 \n\nLet me compute (12-2C)^2 = 144 -48C +4C\u00b2 \n\nSo the equation becomes: \n\n2C\u00b2 +10C +144 -48C +4C\u00b2 =84 \n\nCombine like terms: \n\n(2C\u00b2 +4C\u00b2) + (10C -48C) +144 =84 \n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +144 =84 \n\nSubtract 84: \n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0 \n\nDivide equation by 2: \n\n3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0 \n\nHmm, let's solve this quadratic equation for C. \n\nThe quadratic is 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0 \n\nUsing quadratic formula: C = [19 \u00b1 sqrt(361 - 360)]/(6) \n\nBecause discriminant D= (19)^2 -4*3*30 = 361 -360 =1 \n\nThus sqrt(1)=1 \n\nSo C = [19 \u00b11]/6 \u2192 \n\nPossible solutions: \n\n(19+1)/6 =20/6 \u22483.333\u2026 Not an integer. \n\n(19-1)/6 =18/6 =3 \n\nAh! So C=3 is a solution. \n\nThus, C=3. \n\nSo then, since A = C +5 \u2192 A=8 \n\nThen B =12 -2C =12 -6 =6 \n\nTherefore the digits are A=8, B=6, C=3. \n\nSo the number is 863. \n\nWait, but 863 is not among the options. The options given are 368, 377, 288, 997, 112. \n\nHmm, so that's a problem. The computed number is 863, which isn't an option. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again the equations. \n\nLet me verify the calculation steps again. \n\nStarting from the equations:\n\nSum of digits: A + B + C =17 \n\nA = C +5 \n\nSo substituting: (C+5) + B + C =17 \u2192 2C + B =12 \u2192 B =12-2C \n\nSum of squares: (C+5)^2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\nExpanding (C+5)^2: C\u00b2 +10C +25 \n\nSo total equation: \n\nC\u00b2+10C+25 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\n\u2192 2C\u00b2 +10C +25 + B\u00b2 =109 \n\n\u2192 2C\u00b2 +10C + B\u00b2 =84 \n\nSubstituting B=12-2C: \n\n2C\u00b2 +10C + (12-2C)^2 =84 \n\nExpanding (12-2C)^2: 144 -48C +4C\u00b2 \n\nSo equation becomes: \n\n2C\u00b2 +10C +144 -48C +4C\u00b2 =84 \n\nCombine terms:\n\n2C\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 =6C\u00b2 \n\n10C -48C =-38C \n\nSo 6C\u00b2 -38C +144 =84 \n\nSubtract 84: 6C\u00b2 -38C +60 =0 \n\nDivide by 2: 3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0 \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSolutions: C=(19\u00b11)/6 \u2192 3.333 or 3. So C=3 is the integer solution. \n\nSo with C=3, then A=8, B=6. \n\nSo the number is 863. \n\nHmm, so that's not in the options. So either the options are wrong, or I missed something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe problem says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. So 863 -495 = 368. Which is the reverse of 863? Wait, reverse of 863 is 368. So yes, 863-495=368. That works. \n\nBut 368 is option A. Wait, but earlier when I checked option A, I thought the sum of digits is 3+6+8=17, which is correct. Sum of squares: 9+36+64=109. Which matches. \n\nWait, but then why did I think option A was invalid earlier? Because when I subtract 495 from 368 (the option A's number) I get a negative number. But wait the correct number is 863, not 368. \n\nAh! Here's the mistake! I must have confused the original number with the reversed one. \n\nThe problem states that the original number minus 495 equals the reversed number. So the original number is 863, subtract 495 gives 368, which is the reverse. So 863 is the correct number. \n\nBut 863 is not one of the options. The options given are A)368, B)377, etc. \n\nHmm. That's a problem. Because according to the calculations, the correct number should be 863, which is not listed. \n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option A is 368. Which is the reverse of the correct number. \n\nWait, so maybe I mixed up the original and reversed number? \n\nWait the problem says: subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So original number is N, then N -495 = reversed(N). So N is the original, and reversed is the result. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, which when subtracted by 495 gives 368 (its reverse). \n\nBut since 863 is not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's conditions. Let me check again the sum of digits and squares. \n\nOriginal number 863: digits 8+6+3=17. Sum of squares: 64+36+9=109. So that's correct. \n\nSo the problem's options must have a typo or I misread them. Wait let me check the options again. \n\nThe options given are:\n\nA)368\n\nB)377\n\nC)288\n\nD)997\n\nE)112\n\nHmm. None of them is 863. Wait, but option A is 368, which is the reverse. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem was to find the reversed number? No, the problem says \"Find the number.\" So the original number is 863, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let me try with another possible C. The quadratic had another solution of C=20/6 \u22483.333, which is not an integer. So only C=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me see. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the squares of its digits is 109\". For 863, that's correct. \n\nHmm, but since the options don't have that, maybe I have to see which of the given options, when considered as the original number, might satisfy the conditions. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the first step. Let me try another approach. Let me check each of the options again, but this time carefully. \n\nStarting with option A: 368. \n\nSum of digits:3+6+8=17 \u2714\ufe0f \n\nSum of squares: 9+36+64=109 \u2714\ufe0f \n\nNow, the reverse of 368 is 863. \n\nSubtracting 495 from 368 gives 368-495 = -127, which is not 863. So that condition fails. \n\nBut the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So the reverse should be 368 -495 = -127, which is not the case. \n\nWait, but the correct number is 863, which is not an option. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the problem requires that subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse, so perhaps the original number is 863, but it's not in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me see. \n\nWait, let me check the equations again. \n\nWe had for C=3, so the number is 8 (hundreds), 6 (tens), 3 (units). \n\n8+6+3=17 \u2714\ufe0f \n\n8\u00b2+6\u00b2+3\u00b2=64+36+9=109 \u2714\ufe0f \n\n863-495=368, which is the reverse. \n\nSo that's all correct. \n\nHmm. The problem's options don't include 863. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's reading. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109.\" \n\nSo the number 863 meets those. \n\nThe reverse is 368, and 863-495=368. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863. \n\nBut since it's not an option, perhaps the options have a mistake. Or maybe I missed an option. \n\nWait the options are given as A to E. Let me check again. \n\nOptions are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe there is another possible solution. \n\nWait the quadratic equation had C=3, but what if there are other possibilities? Let me see. \n\nWait, the quadratic equation had only C=3 as integer solution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. \n\nWait let me try C=4. \n\nWait, let's see. Suppose I didn't solve the equation properly. Let me see another way. \n\nSuppose A = C +5. \n\nWe can try possible values for C from 0 to 4, compute B from 2C + B =12 \u2192 B=12-2C. \n\nThen check if the sum of squares equals 109. \n\nLet me try each possible C:\n\nC=0 \u2192 A=5, B=12. But B must be a single digit (0-9). 12 is invalid. \n\nC=1 \u2192 A=6, B=10 \u2192 B=10 invalid. \n\nC=2 \u2192 A=7, B=8. \n\nThen sum of squares: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = 7\u00b2 +8\u00b2 +2\u00b2 =49+64+4=117. Not 109. \n\nC=3 \u2192 A=8, B=6 \u2192 squares:64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nC=4 \u2192 A=9, B=4. \n\nSum of squares: 81 +16 +16 = 113. Not 109. \n\nSo only C=3 gives the correct sum of squares. \n\nThus, the only possible number is 863, which is not in the options. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's statement. \n\nWait the problem says subtract 495 from the number, get the reverse. So original number is N, so N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nThus N = reverse(N) +495. \n\nSo for option A:368, reverse is 863 \u2192 863+495=1358. Not a three-digit number. \n\nOption B:377. Reverse is 773. 773 +495 =1268. Not three-digit. \n\nOption C:288 \u2192 reverse 882 \u2192 882+495=1377. \n\nOption D:997 \u2192 reverse 799 \u2192 799+495=1294. \n\nOption E:112 \u2192 reverse 211 \u2192 211+495=706. \n\nNone of these give the original number. \n\nSo none of the options satisfy the condition. \n\nHmm. But that's impossible because the problem must have an answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me try another approach. \n\nSuppose the original number is N, and the reverse is M. \n\nGiven that N - M =495 \n\nAlso, sum of digits of N is 17. \n\nSum of squares of digits of N is 109. \n\nWe can also note that N - M = 99*(A -C). So 99*(A-C)=495 \u2192 A-C=5. \n\nSo A =C+5. \n\nWe also have A+B+C=17 \u2192 B=17 -A -C \u2192 substituting A=C+5 gives B=17 - (C+5) -C =12-2C. \n\nSum of squares: A\u00b2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2=109. \n\nSubstituting A and B gives (C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\nLet me expand this again carefully. \n\n(C+5)^2 = C\u00b2 +10C +25 \n\n(12-2C)^2 = 144 -48C +4C\u00b2 \n\nC\u00b2 is C\u00b2 \n\nAdding all terms: \n\nC\u00b2+10C+25 +144-48C+4C\u00b2 + C\u00b2 \n\nTotal: (1C\u00b2 +4C\u00b2 +1C\u00b2) + (10C -48C) + (25+144) \n\nSo 6C\u00b2 -38C +169 \n\nSet equal to 109: \n\n6C\u00b2 -38C +169 =109 \n\nSubtract 109: \n\n6C\u00b2-38C +60 =0 \u2192 same equation as before. \n\nSo yeah, same result. So C=3. \n\nThus, the number is 863. \n\nHmm, so the problem's options must be wrong. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's reading. \n\nWait, maybe the question says subtract the number from 495? Like 495 - N = reversed(N). \n\nLet me check the problem statement again: \n\n\"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\"\n\nNo, it's N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a different interpretation. For instance, the number minus 495 is equal to the reverse of the original number. So the reverse is a three-digit number, so N must be at least 495 +100 = 595. \n\nLooking at the options given, only D (997) and A (368) are above 500? Wait 368 is below 500. \n\nWait 997 is the only one over 500. \n\nWait 997 -495 = 502. \n\nReverse of 997 is 799. 502 vs 799. Not equal. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, not necessarily N - reverse(N)=495. \n\nWait, if N - reverse(N)=495, then that's what I did. \n\nAlternatively, reverse(N) - N =495. \n\nIf that's the case, then reverse(N) = N +495. \n\nThen, for option A: reverse(368)=863 \u2192 863-368=495. Oh! That's exactly 495. \n\nAh! Wait a second! Maybe I had the subtraction reversed. \n\nThe problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\", which is N -495 equals the reverse. \n\nBut if the reverse is larger than N, then N -495 would be negative, but the reverse is a positive number. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that when you subtract the number from 495, you get the reverse? That would be 495 - N = reverse(N). But that would give a negative number for N greater than 495. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem meant that the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, regardless of order. \n\nIn that case, either N - reverse(N)=495 or reverse(N) - N=495. \n\nIf it's the latter, then for option A: reverse(N) - N =863-368=495. Which matches. \n\nSo the problem might have meant that the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, but didn't specify the order. \n\nBut the problem's wording is: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" \n\nSo that would mean N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nBut in the case of option A: 368-495= -127, which is not the reverse. \n\nHowever, if reverse(N) - N =495 \u2192 863-368=495. Which would mean that reverse(N) = N +495. \n\nSo the problem might have a wording mistake. If the correct equation is reverse(N) = N -495, then that would be N - reverse(N)=495, which requires N being larger. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have intended that the reverse is obtained by subtracting 495, but in that case, the correct number would have to be larger than 495, and the reverse being smaller. \n\nWait the correct number according to our calculation is 863. \n\n863 -495 = 368, which is its reverse. \n\nSo that is exactly what the problem states. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, which is not among the options. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, looking back at the options again, option A is 368. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is a trick question where the number is 368, but when you subtract 495, you get the reverse (which is 863), but the problem says \"we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order\". \n\nWait, 368's reverse is 863, which is different digits? No, the digits are the same, just reversed. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the same digits written in the reverse order\". So 368's digits are 3,6,8, and the reverse is 8,6,3, which are the same digits. \n\nSo the problem's wording allows that. \n\nBut the equation would require that N -495 equals the reverse. \n\n368-495 is -127, which is not the reverse. \n\nThus, that can't be. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's options, and the correct answer should be 863, which is not listed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the sum of squares for one of the options. \n\nWait, let me recheck option D: 997. \n\nSum of digits:9+9+7=25. Not 17. So no. \n\nOption B:377. Sum is 17, sum of squares 107. \n\nOption C:288 sum is 18. \n\nOption E:112 sum is4. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's first condition. \n\nWait, let me check option B:377. \n\nSum of digits is 3+7+7=17. \n\nSum of squares: 9+49+49=107. \n\nClose to 109, but off by 2. \n\nMaybe there's a typo and the correct number is 377, but the sum of squares should be 107. Or the problem states 109. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 863 but it's not listed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equations. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. Let me check again. \n\nThe quadratic was 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 =0. \n\nSolution C=(19\u00b1\u221a(361-360))/6 \u2192 sqrt(1) is 1, so (19+1)/6=20/6\u22483.333, and (19-1)/6=18/6=3. \n\nYes, so C=3 is the only integer solution. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution steps. \n\nWait, let me try C=4 again. \n\nWait, with C=4, then A=9, B=4 (since B=12-2*4=4). \n\nSum of digits:9+4+4=17. \n\nSum of squares:81 +16 +16 = 113. \n\nHmm. Not 109. \n\nC=2: A=7, B=8. \n\nSum of digits:7+8+2=17. \n\nSum of squares:49+64+4=117. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo only C=3 gives the correct sum of squares. \n\nThus, I think the problem's options are incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the squares of its digits is 109\". \n\nThe number 863's digits squared sum to 64+36+9=109. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps there is an option that I misread. Let me check again: \n\nOptions are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a typo in option A. Like maybe it's 863 instead of 368? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. Let me list all possible three-digit numbers where A = C +5, and digits sum to 17. \n\nSo A = C+5. \n\nPossible C from 0-4. \n\nFor each C from 0-4, compute A and B such that A + B + C =17 \u2192 B=12-2C. \n\nThen check sum of squares. \n\nC=0: A=5, B=12 \u2192 invalid (B must be single-digit). \n\nC=1: A=6, B=10 \u2192 invalid. \n\nC=2: A=7, B=8 \u2192 digits 7,8,2 \u2192 sum squares 49+64+4=117. \n\nC=3: A=8, B=6 \u2192 8,6,3 \u2192 sum squares 109. \n\nC=4: A=9, B=4 \u2192 digits 9,4,4 \u2192 sum squares 81+16+16=113. \n\nOnly C=3 gives the correct sum of squares. \n\nThus, the number is 863. \n\nTherefore, the problem's options are incorrect. \n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe I made an error in the problem's first condition. \n\nWait the problem says the sum of the digits is 17. \n\nThe number 863 has digits summing to 17. \n\nThe options given have option A's digits sum to 17. \n\nSo the only possible option that satisfies the first two conditions (sum and sum of squares) is option A, but it fails the subtraction condition. \n\nAlternatively, the problem may have a different interpretation of the digits. \n\nWait, maybe the digits are allowed to be in any order, but not necessarily the same digits. \n\nNo, the problem states \"the same digits written in the reverse order\". \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the subtraction step. \n\nWait, let me try the number 368 again. \n\n368 minus 495 is indeed -127. Which is not the reverse. \n\nThe reverse is 863, which is 368's reverse. \n\nThus, the problem's correct answer is not among the options, which is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B. \n\nWait, let's see. \n\nOption B is 377. \n\nSum of digits:17. \n\nSum of squares:3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107. \n\nClose to 109. \n\nIf the problem had a typo and the sum of squares is 107, then option B would work. \n\nBut the problem states 109. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in the problem's options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let's check option B:377. \n\nThe reverse would be 773. \n\n377-495= -118, which is not 773. \n\nSo that's not valid. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is option C:288. \n\nDigits sum to 18. No. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, but in absolute terms. \n\nThe difference between 863 and 368 is 495. \n\nThus, the absolute difference is 495. \n\nSo the problem may have meant that the absolute difference is 495. \n\nIn that case, the correct number is 863, but since it's not an option, perhaps the answer is option A, as the reverse. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\" to get the reverse. \n\nSo the only number that fits all conditions is 863, but it's not listed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. \n\nWait, let me try solving for B and C again. \n\nWe have:\n\nA = C+5 \n\nA + B + C =17 \u2192 B = 12-2C \n\nSum of squares: (C+5)^2 + B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\nSubstituting B:\n\n(C+5)^2 + (12-2C)^2 + C\u00b2 =109 \n\nLet me compute this for C=3: \n\n(3+5)^2 =8\u00b2=64 \n\n(12-6)^2=6\u00b2=36 \n\nC\u00b2=9 \n\nTotal:64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nC=3 is correct. \n\nThus, I think the problem's options are incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where the options are different, and there's a typo here. \n\nGiven that in the options provided, the only number that meets the sum and sum of squares is option A (368), but it doesn't meet the subtraction condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a different condition. \n\nWait, maybe the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, and the correct number is 863, but since it's not an option, maybe the question expects us to choose the reverse, which is option A. \n\nEven though technically it doesn't satisfy the subtraction condition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but there's a miscalculation. \n\nWait let's check option B again. \n\n377. \n\nSum of digits is 3+7+7=17. \n\nSum of squares:9+49+49=107. \n\nClose but not 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's condition. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the squares of its digits is 109\". \n\nIf the number is 368, then that's 3\u00b2+6\u00b2+8\u00b2=9+36+64=109. That's correct. \n\nWait a second! Wait, 368's sum of squares is indeed 109. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought the problem requires that when you subtract 495 from the number, you get the reverse. \n\nFor 368, subtracting 495 gives -127, which is not the reverse. \n\nBut the reverse of 368 is 863, which is exactly 368+495=863. \n\nAh! Wait! Maybe the problem says \"subtract the number from 495\" instead of the other way around. \n\nIf that were the case, then 495 - 368 = 127, which is not the reverse. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the reverse of the number to be 495 less than the original number. \n\nWait, that's what I thought. \n\nOriginal number N = 368. \n\nReverse is 863. \n\n863 is 495 more than 368. \n\nThus, N +495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo the equation would be N +495 = reverse(N). \n\nWhich would mean that the reverse is larger. \n\nSo that equation would be: \n\nN +495 = reverse(N) \u2192 reverse(N) - N =495 \n\nWhich is exactly what happens with 368 and 863. \n\nThus, if the problem had said \"add 495 to the number to get the reverse\", then option A would be correct. \n\nBut the problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\". \n\nAh! That's the key. \n\nThe problem says \"subtract 495 from the number\" to get the reverse. \n\nSo N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nWhich would require that N is larger than the reverse by 495. \n\nThus, for the correct number 863, this holds because 863-495=368 (reverse). \n\nThus, the correct number is 863. \n\nBut since it's not an option, perhaps the problem had a typo and the options include 863, but here it's listed as option A as 368. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different answer. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first condition. \n\nWait, let me check option B:377. \n\nIf the number is 377, then subtracting 495 gives -118, which is not the reverse. \n\nThe reverse of 377 is 773. \n\nThus, 377-495 =-118 !=773. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B, but with a different calculation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a mistake and the correct answer is option A. \n\nEven though the subtraction doesn't work, perhaps the other conditions are met. \n\nBut the problem requires all three conditions. \n\nThus, perhaps the options are wrong. \n\nGiven that, in the absence of the correct option, but the closest is option A, but it doesn't satisfy the third condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, let me re-express the equation for option A. \n\nIf N is 368, then reverse is 863. \n\nIf N -495 = reverse \u2192 368 -495 = -127, which is not 863. \n\nBut if the problem requires that reverse(N) - N =495 \u2192 863-368=495, which is correct. \n\nThus, if the problem's equation is reversed, then option A is correct. \n\nPerhaps the problem has a typo in the wording. \n\nIf the problem said \"if we subtract the number from 495, we get the reverse\", then 495 - N = reverse(N). \n\nBut that would require N= 495 - reverse(N). \n\nFor option A:495-368=127, which is not the reverse (863). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says \"the difference between the number and its reverse is 495\", then option A would be valid because the difference between 863 and 368 is 495. \n\nBut the problem's wording specifies subtracting 495 from the number to get the reverse. \n\nGiven that, and the options provided, there's no correct answer. \n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question with options given, and the only option that satisfies the first two conditions (sum and sum of squares) is option A. \n\nPerhaps the problem intended the difference between the number and its reverse to be 495, so the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, even though the subtraction condition is technically not met, the problem might have a wording error, and the answer expected is A. \n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is A, and I made a mistake in thinking that the subtraction must give the reverse, but the problem might allow negative numbers. \n\nWait, the problem says \"a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order\". \n\nThe reverse of 368 is 863, which is a different number. \n\nSubtracting 495 gives -127, which is not 863. \n\nThus, it's not the reverse. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the digits of the result are the reverse, ignoring the negative sign. \n\nBut -127's digits are 1,2,7, which are not the same as 3,6,8. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven the options provided, the only one that meets the first two conditions is A. \n\nPerhaps the question has an error, but since I have to choose from the options, I'll go with option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for option B. \n\nWait let me check option B again. \n\nOption B:377. \n\nSum of digits:3+7+7=17. \n\nSum of squares:9+49+49=107. \n\nClose but not 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B, but the sum of squares was a miscalculation. \n\nWait 3 squared is 9, 7 squared is 49, 7 squared is 49. 9+49=58 +49=107. Yes. \n\nThus, no. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation for the reverse. \n\nWait, the reverse of the number must be three digits. \n\nFor option A's reverse is 863, which is three digits. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, but it's not an option. \n\nGiven the options, perhaps the question had a mistake and the correct answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I'll choose option A as the answer, even though it doesn't satisfy the subtraction condition. \n\nWait, but that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem had a different number. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. \n\nWait, let me see if there are other solutions where A -C =5. \n\nWait, perhaps the equation has another solution if B is allowed to be a two-digit number? \n\nNo, B must be a single digit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's first condition. \n\nWait, the problem says \"three-digit number\". \n\nThus, I think the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different sum of squares. \n\nIf the sum of squares is 107, then option B would be correct. \n\nBut the problem states 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option A, and the problem's subtraction condition is a trick. \n\nWait, maybe when you subtract 495 from the number, you get a number with the same digits in reverse order, but ignoring the negative sign. \n\nSo 368-495 =-127. \n\nThe absolute value is 127, which has digits 1,2,7. Not the same as 3,6,8. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different intended answer. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. Let me list all three-digit numbers where A = C+5 and sum of digits is 17. \n\nPossible C from 0-4: \n\nC=0 \u2192 A=5, B=12 \u2192 invalid. \n\nC=1 \u2192 A=6, B=10 \u2192 invalid. \n\nC=2 \u2192 A=7, B=8 \u2192 digits 7,8,2 \u2192 number 782. \n\nSum of squares:49+64+4=117. \n\nC=3 \u2192 A=8,B=6 \u2192 863 \u2192 sum squares 109. \n\nC=4 \u2192 A=9,B=4 \u2192 944 \u2192 sum squares 81+16+16=113. \n\nThus, only 863 fits all conditions. \n\nThus, the answer is not among the options. \n\nBut since this is a multiple-choice question, the intended answer is likely A)368, as it meets the first two conditions, and the subtraction condition might have been a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reverse calculation. \n\nWait, perhaps the reverse is not of the original number, but of the result after subtraction? \n\nNo, the problem says \"we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order\". \n\nThus, the result must be the reverse of the original's digits. \n\nGiven that, the only possible answer is 863. \n\nBut since it's not an option, I'm forced to choose from the given options. \n\nPerhaps the problem had a different number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B, but with a different interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic solution. \n\nWait, let me recheck the quadratic equation. \n\nThe equation was 3C\u00b2 -19C +30=0. \n\nWait, 3C\u00b2 -19C +30 factors as (3C -10)(C-3) = 0? \n\nLet me check: \n\n(3C-10)(C-3) =3C\u00b2-9C -10C+30=3C\u00b2-19C+30. Yes. \n\nThus, roots are C=10/3 or C=3. \n\nSo C=3 is the only integer solution. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863. \n\nThus, the problem's options are incorrect. \n\nSince I must choose from the given options, perhaps there's an error in the problem's options, and the closest possible is option A. \n\nTherefore, I'll choose option A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first calculation. \n\nWait, the problem's third condition: subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. \n\nThe number is 863 \u2192 863-495=368, which is the reverse. \n\nThus, the correct number is 863, which is not an option. \n\nGiven that, and the options provided, I think the problem might have a mistake. But since I must choose from the options given, perhaps the correct answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from a different source where the options are correct, and I misread them. \n\nWait, looking again at the options: \n\nA)368 \n\nB)377 \n\nC)288 \n\nD)997 \n\nE)112 \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nLet me try with the number 368. \n\nThe sum of digits is 17, sum of squares is 109. \n\nThe reverse is 863. \n\nIf the problem had said \"adding 495 to the number gives the reverse\", then 368+495=863, which is correct. \n\nThus, perhaps the problem had a typo and said \"add\" instead of \"subtract\". \n\nIf that's the case, then the answer is A. \n\nGiven that the problem's wording says \"subtract\", but if there's a typo, then A is correct. \n\nGiven that the options are provided and the problem's answer is likely A if there's a typo, I'll choose option A. \n\nSo the answer is A.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding a three-digit number where the sum of its digits is 17, the sum of their squares is 109, and subtracting 495 from the number yields its reverse. \n\n1. **Define Variables**: Let the number be \\(100A + 10B + C\\), where \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\) are its digits.\n2. **Equations**:\n   - Sum of digits: \\(A + B + C = 17\\).\n   - Sum of squares: \\(A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109\\).\n   - Subtracting 495 from the number gives its reverse: \\(100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A\\).\n3. **Derive Key Equation**: Rearranging the subtraction condition gives \\(99(A - C) = 495 \\implies A - C = 5\\).\n4. **Substitute \\(A = C + 5\\)**:\n   - Substitute into the sum equation: \\( (C + 5) + B + C = 17 \\implies 2C + B = 12 \\implies B = 12 - 2C \\).\n   - Substitute into the sum of squares equation: \\( (C + 5)^2 + (12 - 2C)^2 + C^2 = 109 \\).\n5. **Solve for \\(C\\)**:\n   - Expanding and simplifying yields \\(3C^2 - 19C + 30 = 0\\).\n   - Solving this quadratic equation gives \\(C = 3\\) (only integer solution).\n   - Thus, \\(A = 8\\), \\(B = 6\\), forming the number 863. \n6. **Check Options**: None of the given options (A\u2013E) include 863. However, option A (368) satisfies the first two conditions (sum and sum of squares) and is the reverse of 863. If the problem had a typo (e.g., \"add 495\"), 368 would be correct. Given the options, **A** is the closest valid answer despite the subtraction discrepancy.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a three-digit number. Let me denote the digits as hundreds, tens, and units. Let's call them a, b, c. So the number itself is 100a + 10b + c. \n\nThe problem states three things:\n\n1. The sum of the digits is 17. So, a + b + c = 17.\n2. The sum of the squares of the digits is 109. So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 109.\n3. When we subtract 495 from the original number, we get the reverse of the number. So, (100a +10b + c) - 495 = 100c + 10b + a. Wait, is that right? Because reversing the digits would be 100c + 10b + a? Hmm, actually, the reverse of the number would be 100c + 10b + a only if the original number is abc. Wait, no, if the original number is abc, then reversing would be cba, which is 100c +10b + a. Yes, that's correct. So the equation is:\n\nOriginal number minus 495 equals reversed number. \n\nSo, equation three is: 100a +10b +c - 495 = 100c +10b +a. \n\nLet me rearrange that equation. Let's subtract the right side from both sides to bring everything to the left:\n\n100a +10b +c -495 -100c -10b -a =0 \n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(100a -a) + (10b -10b) + (c -100c) -495 =0 \n\nWhich is 99a -99c -495 =0 \n\nSo, 99(a - c) =495 \n\nDivide both sides by 99: a - c = 5. \n\nSo that's another equation: a - c =5. \n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. a + b + c =17\n2. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =109\n3. a - c =5 \n\nHmm, so let's see. Let me note down these equations again.\n\nEquation 3: a = c +5. \n\nSo substituting a in terms of c into the other equations.\n\nFirst equation: (c +5) + b + c =17 \u2192 2c +5 +b =17 \u2192 2c +b =12 \u2192 b=12 -2c. \n\nSecond equation: (c+5)^2 + b^2 + c^2 =109. \n\nLet me expand (c+5)^2: that's c\u00b2 +10c +25. \n\nSo substituting into the second equation:\n\n(c\u00b2 +10c +25) + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =109 \n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2c\u00b2 +10c +25 + b\u00b2 =109 \n\nBut from the first substitution, we have b =12-2c. So substitute that into the equation:\n\n2c\u00b2 +10c +25 + (12-2c)^2 =109 \n\nLet me compute (12-2c)^2: that's 144 -48c +4c\u00b2. \n\nSo plugging back in:\n\n2c\u00b2 +10c +25 +144 -48c +4c\u00b2 =109 \n\nCombine all terms:\n\n(2c\u00b2 +4c\u00b2) + (10c -48c) + (25+144) = 109 \n\nWhich is 6c\u00b2 -38c +169 =109 \n\nSubtract 109 from both sides:\n\n6c\u00b2 -38c +60 =0 \n\nHmm, let's simplify this quadratic equation. Maybe divide all terms by 2:\n\n3c\u00b2 -19c +30 =0 \n\nNow, let's try to factor this quadratic. Let me see, factors of 3*30=90 that add up to -19? Hmm. Let's see:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 90 and add to -19. Since the middle term is -19c, perhaps the factors are negative. Let me think:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 90 and add to 19. Let's see 9 and 10? 9+10=19. So since the equation is 3c\u00b2 -19c +30 =0, maybe split the middle term as -9c -10c?\n\nWait, let's try to factor 3c\u00b2 -19c +30.\n\nLooking for factors of (3c - a)(c -b) = 0. Let me see:\n\n3c\u00b2 -19c +30. Let's try:\n\n(3c - something)(c - something else). Let me see:\n\nLet me try (3c - 10)(c - 3) \u2192 3c\u00b2 -9c -10c +30 \u2192 3c\u00b2-19c+30. Yes! That works. \n\nSo the factors are (3c -10)(c -3) =0. \n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\n3c -10 =0 \u2192 c=10/3 \u22483.333, but since c is a digit (0-9), this is not possible. \n\nOr c-3=0 \u2192 c=3. \n\nSo c=3. \n\nSo c is 3. \n\nThen from equation 3: a =c +5 \u2192 a=3+5=8. \n\nNow, from the first substitution equation, b=12-2c \u2192 12-6=6. \n\nSo the digits would be a=8, b=6, c=3. \n\nWait, but let's check if this satisfies all the given conditions. \n\nFirst, sum of digits: 8+6+3=17. Correct. \n\nSum of squares: 8\u00b2 +6\u00b2+3\u00b2 =64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nNow, the number is 863. Subtracting 495 gives 863-495= 368. \n\nThe reverse of the original number would be 368. Wait, but the original number is 863, so reversing gives 368. Which matches. \n\nSo that works. But looking at the options, the options given are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. \n\nHmm, the number we found is 863, which isn't listed here. Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nWait, when I had the equation 6c\u00b2 -38c +60 =0 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 3c\u00b2-19c +30=0. Factored into (3c-10)(c-3)=0. So c=3 is correct. \n\nSo a=8, b=6, c=3 \u2192 number is 863. But that's not an option here. The options are A to E. The options include 368 which is the reversed number. So maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup?\n\nWait, let's check the third condition again. The problem says subtract 495 from the original number to get the reverse. \n\nOriginal number N = abc (digits a, b, c). So N -495 = reverse, which is cba. \n\nSo N - (cba) = 495?\n\nWait, no, the problem says subtract 495 from N, so N -495 = reverse. \n\nWait, in our calculation, 863 -495 is 368, which is the reverse. So that's correct. But 863 is not an option. \n\nHmm, the options given are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. \n\nSo none of these options are 863. That suggests I made an error. \n\nHmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me retrace the steps again. Let me check the quadratic equation step again. Let me re-calculate the equation steps carefully.\n\nOriginal equations after substitution:\n\nFrom equation 3, a = c +5. \n\nEquation1: a + b +c =17 \u2192 (c+5) + b +c =17 \u2192 2c +5 +b =17 \u2192 2c + b =12 \u2192 b=12-2c. \n\nEquation2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =109 \u2192 (c+5)^2 + (12-2c)^2 +c\u00b2 =109 \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(c+5)^2 = c\u00b2 +10c +25 \n\n(12-2c)^2 = 144 -48c +4c\u00b2 \n\nc\u00b2 is just c\u00b2 \n\nAdding all together: \n\n(c\u00b2 +10c +25) + (144-48c +4c\u00b2) + c\u00b2 \n\nTotal terms: \n\nc\u00b2 +4c\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =6c\u00b2 \n\n10c -48c =-38c \n\n25+144=169 \n\nSo total equation: 6c\u00b2 -38c +169 =109 \n\nSubtract 109: 6c\u00b2 -38c +60 =0 \u2192 dividing by 2 gives 3c\u00b2-19c+30=0 \u2192 which factors as (3c-10)(c-3)=0. \n\nSo c=3 is correct. \n\nHmm. So the problem is that the answer is not in the options. Did I misread the options?\n\nWait, the options are A)368, which is the reversed number here. Wait, the problem says subtract 495 from the original number to get the reverse. So the original number must be larger than 495. 863 is 863-495=368, which is the reverse. So 863 is the original number, but it's not an option. \n\nHmm. That suggests I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the equations again. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation when subtracting. Let me re-derive the third condition. \n\nThe original number is 100a +10b +c. \n\nSubtracting 495 gives the reversed number, which is 100c +10b +a. \n\nSo equation is:\n\n100a +10b +c -495 = 100c +10b +a \n\nSubtracting the right side from left:\n\n100a +10b +c -495 -100c -10b -a =0 \n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(100a -a) + (10b-10b) + (c -100c) -495 =0 \n\n99a -99c -495=0 \n\nWhich is 99(a -c)=495 \u2192 a -c =5. That's correct. \n\nHmm. So the equations are correct. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic when solving for the quadratic. Let me recheck the quadratic steps again. \n\nWait, when I computed (12-2c)^2, let's see:\n\n(12-2c)^2 = 12\u00b2 - 2*12*2c + (2c)^2 \u2192 144 -48c +4c\u00b2 \u2192 yes that's correct. \n\nAdding all terms:\n\n(c+5)^2 + (12-2c)^2 +c^2 \n\nWait, wait a second. Wait, the second equation is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = 109. \n\nWait, a is (c+5), b is (12-2c), and c is c. \n\nSo the equation is (c+5)^2 + (12-2c)^2 + c^2 =109. \n\nAh! Oh wait, I think I made a mistake here! Wait, in the sum of squares, the terms are a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2. But I included c\u00b2 again. Wait, the original equation is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =109. \n\nSo when substituting, it's (c+5)^2 (a squared) plus (12-2c)^2 (b squared) plus c squared (c squared). So that's correct. \n\nWait, so the calculation was correct. So why isn't the answer in the options? \n\nWait, maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I miscalculated the digits. Let me check the digits again. \n\na=8, b=6, c=3. So the number is 863. \n\nCheck the sum of digits: 8+6+3=17. Correct. \n\nSum of squares: 64 + 36 +9 = 109. Correct. \n\n863-495 = 368, which is the reverse. \n\nHmm, so the answer isn't in the options. But the options given are A to E, none of which is 863. Wait, the options are:\n\nA)368 (the reverse number)\n\nB)377 \n\nC)288 \n\nD)997 \n\nE)112 \n\nHmm. So perhaps I made an error in the setup. Let me check each option to see if any of them fit the conditions. \n\nLet me check option C: 288. \n\nDigits: 2, 8, 8. \n\nSum is 2+8+8=18. Not 17. So no. \n\nOption B: 377. \n\n3+7+7=17. That's good. \n\nSum of squares: 9+49+49= 107. Not 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption A: 368. \n\n3+6+8=17. \n\nSum of squares: 9+36+64= 109. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the sum here. \n\nWait, so 368's digits sum to 17, squares sum to 109. But then, if the original number is 368, subtract 495 would be 368-495 = negative number. Which can't be. \n\nWait, but the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So the original number must be larger than 495. \n\nSo 368 is less than 495, so that can't be. \n\nWait, but if the original number is 863 (as I found), then subtracting gives 368. But since 863 isn't an option, maybe I have to check other options. \n\nLet me check option D: 997. \n\nDigits:9+9+7=25. Not 17. \n\nOption E:112: sum is 4, no. \n\nOption B:377. Sum is 17, but squares sum to 9+49+49= 107. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me check if there's another solution. Because maybe there was an error in solving the quadratic. \n\nThe quadratic equation was 3c\u00b2 -19c +30 =0. Let me compute discriminant: D= 361 - 360 =1. Wait wait, discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. \n\nWait, equation is 3c\u00b2 -19c +30=0. \n\nDiscriminant D = (-19)^2 -4*3*30 = 361 - 360 =1. \n\nSo sqrt(D)=1. \n\nThus, the roots are [19 \u00b11]/6. \n\nSo (19+1)/6=20/6=10/3\u22483.333, which is not a digit. \n\nOr (19-1)/6=18/6=3. So c=3 is the only solution. \n\nHmm. So no other solutions. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I considered a three-digit number where a is the hundreds digit. But when you reverse, maybe leading zeros are allowed? Like, if the original number is 803, then reversed is 308. But in the problem statement, the reverse must be a three-digit number as well. Because subtracting 495 from a three-digit number (assuming it's at least 495) would give another three-digit number. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, but according to the problem, the number is three-digit. So the reverse must also be three-digit. So c can't be zero. \n\nWait, but in my solution, c is 3. So that's okay. \n\nHmm. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, let me re-express the third condition again. \n\nThe problem states that when you subtract 495 from the number, you get the reverse. \n\nSo N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nTherefore, reverse(N) = N -495. \n\nThus, reverse(N) must be less than N. \n\nWhich is true in the case of 863 -495=368, which is reverse. \n\nBut 863 isn't an option. \n\nHmm. Maybe the problem was in the direction of the subtraction? \n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that subtracting 495 gives the reverse. So N - 495 = reverse(N). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reverse minus the number is 495? But the problem says subtract 495 from the number. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in the other direction: the reverse minus the original number is 495? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" \n\nSo N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo the original number must be bigger than 495. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let's check option C: 288. \n\n288 -495 is negative. Not possible. \n\nOption B:377. 377-495 is negative. \n\nOption A:368-495 is negative. \n\nSo only option D:997 and E:112 are left. \n\nBut 997-495 is 502. The reverse of 997 is 799. 502 is not 799. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, so none of the options satisfy the conditions except my original solution of 863, which is not listed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109.\" \n\nLet me check option B: 377. \n\nDigits sum: 3+7+7=17. Correct. \n\nSum of squares: 9+49+49= 107. Not 109. \n\nClose but not exactly. \n\nOption C:288 \u2192 2+8+8=18. \n\nNo. \n\nOption D:997 \u2192 sum is 25. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption A:368 \u2192 sum 3+6+8=17. \n\nSum of squares: 9+36+64=109. \n\nWait a second! Oh! \n\nWait, 3+6+8 is 17, and squares sum to 109. So that's exactly the first two conditions. \n\nBut then, the problem says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. \n\nSo if the number is 368, subtracting 495 would give a negative number. But 368 is the reverse of the original number. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's third condition. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" \n\nWait, maybe the number is such that when you subtract 495, you get the reverse. \n\nSo if the original number is N, then N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo for N=368, reverse(N)=863. \n\nBut 368-495 is -127, which is not 863. \n\nSo that's not correct. \n\nWait, but if the original number is 863, then 863-495=368, which is the reverse. So that's correct, but 863 is not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution steps. \n\nLet me try to test the options given. \n\nTake option C:288. \n\nCheck the three conditions. \n\nSum digits: 2+8+8=18 \u226017 \u2192 no. \n\nOption B:377. \n\nSum digits:17. \n\nSum squares:3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107 \u2260109. \n\nClose but no. \n\nOption A:368. \n\nSum digits:17. \n\nSum squares:9+36+64=109. \n\nThird condition: 368-495= -127, which is not the reverse (which would be 863). \n\nSo that's invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, is there another possible solution? Let me see. \n\nWait, the quadratic equation gives only one valid solution (c=3). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was an error in the equation setup. \n\nWait, the third equation: \n\nThe original number minus 495 equals the reverse. \n\nSo N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo N - reverse(N) =495. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the difference between the number and its reverse is 495. \n\nWait, in my previous solution, the difference between 863 and 368 is 495. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nBut the question says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. Which is exactly that. \n\nSo the original number must be N = reverse(N) +495. \n\nSo the difference N - reverse(N) =495. \n\nHmm. \n\nNow, perhaps there are other numbers where the difference between the number and its reverse is 495. \n\nLet me think. \n\nLet me see for other possible a and c where a -c=5. \n\nWait, because from equation a -c=5. \n\nSo possible c can be from 0 to 9, but a has to be a digit (1-9) so c can be up to 4 (since a =c+5 can't exceed 9. So c can be up to 4 (since 4+5=9). \n\nWait, in my previous solution, c was 3. \n\nWhat if c=4? Then a=9. \n\nLet me see if that gives another solution. \n\nLet me try c=4. \n\nThen a=9. \n\nFrom equation 1: a +b +c =17 \u2192 9 +b +4 =17 \u2192 b=4. \n\nThen check the sum of squares: 9\u00b2 +4\u00b2 +4\u00b2 =81 +16 +16= 113 \u2260109. \n\nNo. \n\nc=2: a=7. \n\nThen equation1:7 +b +2 =17 \u2192 b=8. \n\nSum of squares: 49 +64 +4 = 117. Not 109. \n\nc=1: a=6 \u2192 6 +b+1 =17 \u2192 b=10 \u2192 but b has to be a single digit. Not possible. \n\nc=0 \u2192 a=5 \u2192 5 +b+0=17 \u2192 b=12 \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo the only possible c is 3. \n\nSo the only solution is 863, which isn't in the options. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the problem's third condition. Let me read it again. \n\n\"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" \n\nWait, maybe the reverse is written in the same digits, but not necessarily the exact reverse? Or maybe the digits are the same but rearranged? \n\nWait, the problem says \"written in the reverse order\". So the exact reverse. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question is in another way: the number minus 495 gives the reverse, so N - reverse(N) =495. \n\nWait, that's the same as before. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the options again. \n\nWait, option B:377. \n\nReverse is 773. \n\n377 -495 = -118. Not 773. \n\nOption C:288 \u2192 reverse is 882. 288-495 is -207. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption D:997 \u2192 reverse is 799. 997-495=502 \u2260799. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, is there another way this could work? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the reverse is the number minus 495, but the number is smaller than 495, so the reverse would have a leading zero? \n\nFor example, if the number is 368, subtract 495 gives -127, but the reverse would be 863, but that's not equal to -127. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the equation setup. Let me try to set up the equation again. \n\nLet me denote the original number as 100a +10b +c. \n\nThe reverse is 100c +10b +a. \n\nThe problem says that N -495 = reverse. \n\nThus, \n\n100a +10b +c -495 = 100c +10b +a \n\nSubtracting gives:\n\n99a -99c =495 \u2192 a -c =5. Correct. \n\nSo that's right. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares. \n\nWait, let me recheck the sum of squares for 863: 8\u00b2 +6\u00b2 +3\u00b2 =64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the number is 863, and the options are wrong? But that's unlikely. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation for the sum of squares. Let me see. \n\nWait, the problem says the sum of squares of digits is 109. So for 863 it is correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me look at option B:377. \n\nSum of squares is 9+49+49=107. \n\nIf I had made a mistake in the problem's sum of squares as 107, then maybe 377 is the answer, but the problem says 109. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. \n\nOptions are: \n\nA)368 \n\nB)377 \n\nC)288 \n\nD)997 \n\nE)112 \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me check option C: 288. \n\nDigits 2,8,8. \n\nSum is 18, so no. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem's options, but given that the user provided them, I have to choose from the given options. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the quadratic. Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps when I set up the equation for the sum of squares, I missed a term. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the sum of squares equation again. \n\nOriginal substitution: \n\na =c+5 \n\nb=12-2c \n\nSo a squared is (c+5)^2 \n\nb squared is (12-2c)^2 \n\nc squared is c\u00b2 \n\nSum: \n\n(c+5)^2 + (12-2c)^2 +c\u00b2 \n\nWait, that's correct. \n\nWait, let me compute for c=3. \n\n(c+5)^2 =8\u00b2=64 \n\n(12-2c)^2 when c=3 is (12-6)=6 \u2192 36 \n\nc squared is 9 \n\nTotal:64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo the only possible solution is 863, which is not in the options. \n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. \n\nWait, the problem says \"three digit number\"\u2014so the original number must be three digits. \n\nThe reverse of it is also a three-digit number. \n\nSo when subtracting 495, it must be a three-digit number. \n\nSo the original number must be at least 495 +100=595 (so that subtracting 495 gives at least 100). \n\nSo 863 is okay. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different solution where a -c is not 5? \n\nWait, the third condition gave us a -c =5. \n\nSo that's fixed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different third condition. \n\nWait, the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. \n\nWait, maybe I have to subtract the reverse from the number to get 495? \n\nWait, if the problem had said \"the difference between the number and its reverse is 495\", then N - reverse(N)=495, which is what I have. \n\nSo that's the same as the given condition. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in the other direction: reverse(N) - N =495, which would mean the number is smaller. \n\nLet me check that possibility. \n\nSuppose reverse(N) - N =495. \n\nThen the equation would be (100c +10b +a) - (100a +10b +c) =495 \n\nWhich is 99c -99a =495 \u2192 c -a =5 \u2192 a =c-5 \n\nBut then a has to be at least 1, so c must be at least 6. \n\nLet me try this approach. \n\nLet me re-derive the equations with this new condition. \n\nAssume that reverse(N) -N =495. \n\nThen, the equations would be: \n\n1. a +b +c=17 \n\n2. a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109 \n\n3. c -a =5 \u2192 c= a +5 \n\nNow, substituting equation3 into the others. \n\nEquation1: a +b + (a+5) =17 \u2192 2a +b +5=17 \u21922a +b=12 \u2192b=12-2a \n\nEquation2: a\u00b2 + (12-2a)^2 + (a+5)^2=109 \n\nLet's expand each term: \n\na\u00b2 \n\n(12-2a)^2 = 144 -48a +4a\u00b2 \n\n(a+5)^2 =a\u00b2 +10a +25 \n\nAdding all together: \n\na\u00b2 + (144-48a+4a\u00b2) + (a\u00b2+10a+25) \n\nTotal terms: \n\na\u00b2+4a\u00b2+a\u00b2=6a\u00b2 \n\n-48a +10a =-38a \n\n144+25=169 \n\nSo equation is 6a\u00b2 -38a +169 =109 \n\nSubtract 109: \n\n6a\u00b2 -38a +60 =0 \u2192 divide by 2 \u21923a\u00b2 -19a +30=0 \n\nDiscriminant D= 361 - 360 =1 \n\nSolutions: [19 \u00b11]/6 \n\nSo (19+1)/6=20/6\u22483.333 \u2192 not integer \n\n(19-1)/6=18/6=3 \u2192 a=3 \n\nThus, a=3 \n\nThen c= a+5=8 \n\nb=12-2a=12-6=6 \n\nSo digits a=3, b=6, c=8 \u2192 number is 368. \n\nCheck sum digits:3+6+8=17. \n\nSum of squares:9+36+64=109. \n\nReverse(N) - N = 863 -368=495. \n\nSo this satisfies the condition reverse(N) - N=495. \n\nBut the problem states that subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. \n\nWait, in this case, N=368. \n\n368 -495 =-127, which is not the reverse (863). \n\nHowever, the reverse minus N is 495. \n\nSo this is a different equation. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo if the problem had said that the reverse is 495 more than the number, then the answer would be 368, which is option A. \n\nBut the problem says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. \n\nSo 368 is not the correct answer under the original problem's condition. \n\nBut perhaps the problem had a typo, and the third condition is the reverse minus the number equals 495. In that case, the answer is option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem's third condition. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" \n\nSo N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nBut in this scenario with N=368, that would require 368-495=reverse(N) \u2192 reverse(N) is -127, which is impossible. \n\nThus, the only possible solution is 863, which is not listed. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, the options given include option B:377. \n\nLet me see what happens if the number is 377. \n\nReverse is 773. \n\n377-495= -118. Not 773. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption C:288. \n\nReverse is 882. 288-495= -207. \n\nNo. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem was to add 495? \n\nIf the problem had said adding 495 gives the reverse, then N +495 = reverse(N). \n\nLet's see for N=368: 368+495=863, which is the reverse. \n\nIn that case, the answer would be 368 (option A). \n\nBut the problem says subtracting. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options, and the correct answer is 863, but since it's not there, perhaps the closest option is A (368), but that doesn't fit the subtraction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the quadratic solution. \n\nWait, let me try option B:377. \n\nLet me see if there's a different way to get that. \n\nSuppose the equations are: \n\na +b +c =17 \n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109 \n\nand a -c=5 (from the first interpretation). \n\nThen, for 377, a=3, b=7, c=7. \n\nCheck a-c =3-7= -4, which is not 5. \n\nSo that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third condition's equation is different. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, let me think differently. \n\nSuppose the number is N = 100a +10b +c. \n\nThe reverse is 100c +10b +a. \n\nSubtracting 495 from N gives the reverse: \n\nN -495 = reverse \u2192 \n\nSo N - reverse =495 \u2192 \n\n(100a +10b +c) - (100c +10b +a) =495 \u2192 \n\n99a -99c =495 \u2192 a -c=5 \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo equations are correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe problem must have the correct answer as 863, but since it's not in the options, perhaps the options are wrong. But since this is a multiple-choice question and the user provided the options, I must choose the closest possible. \n\nWait, option B is 377. Let me check the sum of squares again. \n\n3\u00b2 +7\u00b2+7\u00b2 = 9+49+49 = 107. Which is close to 109 but not exactly. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation for the quadratic. Let me recheck the steps. \n\nWait, when I substituted b=12-2c into the squares equation, let's see for option B: 377. \n\nIf a=3, c=7 (since a -c= -4, which isn't 5). \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try each option and see if any of them fit all conditions. \n\nOption A:368 \u2192 digits 3,6,8 \n\nSum:17, squares sum 109. \n\nBut N -495 = 368-495 = -127, which is not the reverse (863). \n\nSo that's invalid. \n\nOption B:377 \u2192 sum digits 17, squares sum 107. So not 109. \n\nOption C:288 \u2192 sum 18, no. \n\nOption D:997 \u2192 sum 25, no. \n\nE:112 \u2192 sum 4, no. \n\nSo none of them except 368 and 377 have the first two conditions, but they fail the third. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's third condition. Maybe the difference between the number and the reverse is 495, regardless of direction. \n\nSo either N - reverse =495 or reverse - N=495. \n\nIn that case, both 863 and 368 would satisfy that. \n\nBut the problem specifies subtracting 495 from the number to get the reverse. \n\nThus, the only possible solution is 863, but it's not in the options. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, the options might have a mistake. But since this is a problem from somewhere, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. \n\nLet me list all three-digit numbers where the digits sum to 17 and the squares sum to 109. \n\nLet me see. \n\nLooking for a, b, c digits (a from 1-9, b and c 0-9) such that a +b +c=17 and a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109. \n\nLet me think of possible triplets. \n\nStart with a=9: \n\nThen b +c =8 \n\na\u00b2=81 \n\nSo b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109-81=28 \n\nLooking for two numbers b and c adding to 8, with squares adding to28. \n\nPossible pairs: \n\n0+8 \u2192 squares 0+64=64>28 \n\n1+7 \u21921+49=50>28 \n\n2+6 \u21924+36=40 \n\n3+5 \u21929+25=34 \n\n4+4 \u219216+16=32 \n\nNone of these give 28. \n\na=8: \n\nb +c=9 \n\na\u00b2=64 \n\nThus, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109-64=45 \n\nLooking for two numbers adding to9 with squares adding to45. \n\nPossible pairs: \n\n0+9 \u21920+81=81>45 \n\n1+8 \u21921+64=65 \n\n2+7 \u21924+49=53 \n\n3+6 \u21929+36=45 \u2192 yes! \n\nSo b=3, c=6 or vice versa. \n\nSo digits could be 8,3,6 \u2192 sum is 17. \n\nSo numbers are 836, 863, 386, etc. \n\nWait, since a=8, the hundreds digit is 8. \n\nSo possible numbers are 836, 863. \n\nAlso, if b and c are 6 and3, same. \n\nCheck sum of squares: 8\u00b2+3\u00b2+6\u00b2=64+9+36=109. \n\nYes. \n\nSo these numbers (836 and 863) meet the first two conditions. \n\nNow check the third condition. \n\nTake 836: subtract 495 \u2192 836-495=341. \n\nReverse of 836 is 638. 341 \u2260638. \n\n863-495=368, which is the reverse. So that's correct. \n\nOther numbers: \n\nIf a=7, then b +c=10 \n\na squared is 49 \n\nsum of squares:109-49=60 \n\nLooking for two numbers adding to10 with squares adding to60. \n\nPossible pairs: \n\n0+10 \u2192 but c can't be 10 \n\n1+9 \u21921+81=82 \n\n2+8 \u21924+64=68 \n\n3+7 \u21929+49=58 \n\n4+6 \u219216+36=52 \n\n5+5 \u219225+25=50 \n\nNone add to60. \n\na=6: \n\nb +c=11 \n\na\u00b2=36 \n\nsum of squares:109-36=73 \n\nLooking for two numbers adding to11 with squares adding to73. \n\nPossible pairs: \n\n0+11 \u2192 no \n\n1+10 \u2192 no \n\n2+9 \u21924+81=85 \n\n3+8 \u21929+64=73 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo b=3, c=8 or b=8,c=3 \n\nThus numbers like 638, 683. \n\nCheck third condition. \n\nTake 638 \u2192 subtract 495 gives 638-495=143. Reverse is 836. 143\u2260836. \n\n683-495=188. Reverse is 386. Not equal. \n\nSo only 863 works. \n\nThus the correct answer is 863, but it's not listed. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, the options have 368. Maybe the question had a different third condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem was to add 445 instead of 495? \n\nWait, but I have to go with the given question. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's third condition. \n\nWait, the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. \n\nIf the number is 368, the reverse is 863. \n\nSo 863 - 368 =495. \n\nAh! Wait a second! \n\nWait, maybe the question was phrased as \"the number minus its reverse is 495\". \n\nIn that case, N - reverse(N)=495 \u2192 which gives 863-368=495. \n\nBut the problem says \"subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse\". \n\nWhich would mean N -495 = reverse \u2192 which is correct for N=863. \n\nBut since it's not an option, perhaps the question had a typo and the number is 368, and the correct answer is A, but the third condition was reversed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different third condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question says that when you add 495 to the number, you get the reverse. \n\nThen 368 +495= 863, which is the reverse. \n\nIn that case, the answer is 368 (option A). \n\nGiven that the problem's third condition is crucial here, and the options don't include 863, but option A is the reverse of the correct number, perhaps there was a mix-up in the question's subtraction/addition. \n\nAssuming that the problem might have said \"add 495\" instead of subtract, then option A is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. \n\nGiven that the options don't include the correct answer, but option A fits the first two conditions, maybe the intended answer is A)368. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different third condition. \n\nWait, let me recheck the problem's wording again: \n\n\"The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.\" \n\nSo the problem is as I thought. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A, which satisfies the first two conditions but not the third. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and the third condition is the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, which would give 863-368=495. \n\nIn that case, the number could be either 863 or 368. Since 863 isn't an option, the answer would be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's third condition is that subtracting the reverse from the number gives 495, which would mean N - reverse(N) =495, so N is 863. \n\nSince it's not an option, I'm stuck. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. \n\nWait, let me try with the options given. \n\nLooking for a number that when subtracted by 495 gives its reverse. \n\nCheck option A:368 \n\n368-495= -127 \u2192 not reverse (863). \n\nOption B:377 \n\n377-495= -118 \u2192 no. \n\nC:288-495= -207 \u2192 no. \n\nD:997-495=502 \u2192 reverse is 799 \u2192 no. \n\nE:112-495= -383 \u2192 no. \n\nNone work. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong, or I'm missing something. \n\nWait, let me think of another possible solution. \n\nSuppose a -c =5 \n\nFrom the first equations, the only solution was c=3, a=8, b=6. \n\nSo the number is 863. \n\nBut since it's not an option, perhaps the problem had a different digit sum or square sum. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sum of squares for option B. \n\n377's squares:3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says the sum of squares is 107, then the answer would be B. \n\nBut the problem states 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. \n\nLet me list all possible three-digit numbers where digits sum to 17 and squares sum to 109. \n\nWe found two numbers: 836 and 863. \n\n836: digits 8,3,6. \n\nSum squares: 64+9+36=109. \n\nReverse is 638. \n\n836-495=341 \u2260638. \n\n863-495=368 (reverse). \n\nSo only 863 meets all conditions. \n\nSince it's not an option, I think the problem must have a typo. \n\nBut given the options, the closest is option A, which is the reverse of the correct number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question's third condition is the reverse of the number minus the number equals 495, so 863-368=495. \n\nIn that case, the number could be either 863 or 368. \n\nSince 863 isn't an option, the answer must be A. \n\nTherefore, I'll choose option A as the answer, assuming there was a mistake in the problem's condition direction.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem requires finding a three-digit number where the sum of its digits is 17, the sum of the squares of its digits is 109, and subtracting 495 from the number gives its reverse. \n\nLet the digits be \\(a\\) (hundreds), \\(b\\) (tens), and \\(c\\) (units).

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a three-digit number. Let me denote the digits as hundreds, tens, and units. Let's call them a, b, c. So the number itself is 100a + 10b + c. \n\nThe problem states three things:\n\n1. The sum of the digits is 17. So, a + b + c = 17.\n2. The sum of the squares of the digits is 109. So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 109.\n3. When we subtract 495 from the original number, we get the reverse of the number. So, (100a +10b + c) - 495 = 100c + 10b + a. Wait, is that right? Because reversing the digits would be 100c + 10b + a? Hmm, actually, the reverse of the number would be 100c + 10b + a only if the original number is abc. Wait, no, if the original number is abc, then reversing would be cba, which is 100c +10b + a. Yes, that's correct. So the equation is:\n\nOriginal number minus 495 equals reversed number. \n\nSo, equation three is: 100a +10b +c - 495 = 100c +10b +a. \n\nLet me rearrange that equation. Let's subtract the right side from both sides to bring everything to the left:\n\n100a +10b +c -495 -100c -10b -a =0 \n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(100a -a) + (10b -10b) + (c -100c) -495 =0 \n\nWhich is 99a -99c -495 =0 \n\nSo, 99(a - c) =495 \n\nDivide both sides by 99: a - c = 5. \n\nSo that's another equation: a - c =5. \n\nSo now we have three equations:\n\n1. a + b + c =17\n2. a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =109\n3. a - c =5 \n\nHmm, so let's see. Let me note down these equations again.\n\nEquation 3: a = c +5. \n\nSo substituting a in terms of c into the other equations.\n\nFirst equation: (c +5) + b + c =17 \u2192 2c +5 +b =17 \u2192 2c +b =12 \u2192 b=12 -2c. \n\nSecond equation: (c+5)^2 + b^2 + c^2 =109. \n\nLet me expand (c+5)^2: that's c\u00b2 +10c +25. \n\nSo substituting into the second equation:\n\n(c\u00b2 +10c +25) + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =109 \n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2c\u00b2 +10c +25 + b\u00b2 =109 \n\nBut from the first substitution, we have b =12-2c. So substitute that into the equation:\n\n2c\u00b2 +10c +25 + (12-2c)^2 =109 \n\nLet me compute (12-2c)^2: that's 144 -48c +4c\u00b2. \n\nSo plugging back in:\n\n2c\u00b2 +10c +25 +144 -48c +4c\u00b2 =109 \n\nCombine all terms:\n\n(2c\u00b2 +4c\u00b2) + (10c -48c) + (25+144) = 109 \n\nWhich is 6c\u00b2 -38c +169 =109 \n\nSubtract 109 from both sides:\n\n6c\u00b2 -38c +60 =0 \n\nHmm, let's simplify this quadratic equation. Maybe divide all terms by 2:\n\n3c\u00b2 -19c +30 =0 \n\nNow, let's try to factor this quadratic. Let me see, factors of 3*30=90 that add up to -19? Hmm. Let's see:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 90 and add to -19. Since the middle term is -19c, perhaps the factors are negative. Let me think:\n\nLooking for two numbers that multiply to 90 and add to 19. Let's see 9 and 10? 9+10=19. So since the equation is 3c\u00b2 -19c +30 =0, maybe split the middle term as -9c -10c?\n\nWait, let's try to factor 3c\u00b2 -19c +30.\n\nLooking for factors of (3c - a)(c -b) = 0. Let me see:\n\n3c\u00b2 -19c +30. Let's try:\n\n(3c - something)(c - something else). Let me see:\n\nLet me try (3c - 10)(c - 3) \u2192 3c\u00b2 -9c -10c +30 \u2192 3c\u00b2-19c+30. Yes! That works. \n\nSo the factors are (3c -10)(c -3) =0. \n\nSetting each factor equal to zero:\n\n3c -10 =0 \u2192 c=10/3 \u22483.333, but since c is a digit (0-9), this is not possible. \n\nOr c-3=0 \u2192 c=3. \n\nSo c=3. \n\nSo c is 3. \n\nThen from equation 3: a =c +5 \u2192 a=3+5=8. \n\nNow, from the first substitution equation, b=12-2c \u2192 12-6=6. \n\nSo the digits would be a=8, b=6, c=3. \n\nWait, but let's check if this satisfies all the given conditions. \n\nFirst, sum of digits: 8+6+3=17. Correct. \n\nSum of squares: 8\u00b2 +6\u00b2+3\u00b2 =64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nNow, the number is 863. Subtracting 495 gives 863-495= 368. \n\nThe reverse of the original number would be 368. Wait, but the original number is 863, so reversing gives 368. Which matches. \n\nSo that works. But looking at the options, the options given are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. \n\nHmm, the number we found is 863, which isn't listed here. Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nWait, when I had the equation 6c\u00b2 -38c +60 =0 \u2192 divided by 2 gives 3c\u00b2-19c +30=0. Factored into (3c-10)(c-3)=0. So c=3 is correct. \n\nSo a=8, b=6, c=3 \u2192 number is 863. But that's not an option here. The options are A to E. The options include 368 which is the reversed number. So maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup?\n\nWait, let's check the third condition again. The problem says subtract 495 from the original number to get the reverse. \n\nOriginal number N = abc (digits a, b, c). So N -495 = reverse, which is cba. \n\nSo N - (cba) = 495?\n\nWait, no, the problem says subtract 495 from N, so N -495 = reverse. \n\nWait, in our calculation, 863 -495 is 368, which is the reverse. So that's correct. But 863 is not an option. \n\nHmm, the options given are A)368, B)377, C)288, D)997, E)112. \n\nSo none of these options are 863. That suggests I made an error. \n\nHmm, where did I go wrong?\n\nLet me retrace the steps again. Let me check the quadratic equation step again. Let me re-calculate the equation steps carefully.\n\nOriginal equations after substitution:\n\nFrom equation 3, a = c +5. \n\nEquation1: a + b +c =17 \u2192 (c+5) + b +c =17 \u2192 2c +5 +b =17 \u2192 2c + b =12 \u2192 b=12-2c. \n\nEquation2: a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =109 \u2192 (c+5)^2 + (12-2c)^2 +c\u00b2 =109 \n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(c+5)^2 = c\u00b2 +10c +25 \n\n(12-2c)^2 = 144 -48c +4c\u00b2 \n\nc\u00b2 is just c\u00b2 \n\nAdding all together: \n\n(c\u00b2 +10c +25) + (144-48c +4c\u00b2) + c\u00b2 \n\nTotal terms: \n\nc\u00b2 +4c\u00b2 +c\u00b2 =6c\u00b2 \n\n10c -48c =-38c \n\n25+144=169 \n\nSo total equation: 6c\u00b2 -38c +169 =109 \n\nSubtract 109: 6c\u00b2 -38c +60 =0 \u2192 dividing by 2 gives 3c\u00b2-19c+30=0 \u2192 which factors as (3c-10)(c-3)=0. \n\nSo c=3 is correct. \n\nHmm. So the problem is that the answer is not in the options. Did I misread the options?\n\nWait, the options are A)368, which is the reversed number here. Wait, the problem says subtract 495 from the original number to get the reverse. So the original number must be larger than 495. 863 is 863-495=368, which is the reverse. So 863 is the original number, but it's not an option. \n\nHmm. That suggests I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check the equations again. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation when subtracting. Let me re-derive the third condition. \n\nThe original number is 100a +10b +c. \n\nSubtracting 495 gives the reversed number, which is 100c +10b +a. \n\nSo equation is:\n\n100a +10b +c -495 = 100c +10b +a \n\nSubtracting the right side from left:\n\n100a +10b +c -495 -100c -10b -a =0 \n\nSimplify terms:\n\n(100a -a) + (10b-10b) + (c -100c) -495 =0 \n\n99a -99c -495=0 \n\nWhich is 99(a -c)=495 \u2192 a -c =5. That's correct. \n\nHmm. So the equations are correct. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the arithmetic when solving for the quadratic. Let me recheck the quadratic steps again. \n\nWait, when I computed (12-2c)^2, let's see:\n\n(12-2c)^2 = 12\u00b2 - 2*12*2c + (2c)^2 \u2192 144 -48c +4c\u00b2 \u2192 yes that's correct. \n\nAdding all terms:\n\n(c+5)^2 + (12-2c)^2 +c^2 \n\nWait, wait a second. Wait, the second equation is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 = 109. \n\nWait, a is (c+5), b is (12-2c), and c is c. \n\nSo the equation is (c+5)^2 + (12-2c)^2 + c^2 =109. \n\nAh! Oh wait, I think I made a mistake here! Wait, in the sum of squares, the terms are a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 +c\u00b2. But I included c\u00b2 again. Wait, the original equation is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =109. \n\nSo when substituting, it's (c+5)^2 (a squared) plus (12-2c)^2 (b squared) plus c squared (c squared). So that's correct. \n\nWait, so the calculation was correct. So why isn't the answer in the options? \n\nWait, maybe the options have a typo, or perhaps I miscalculated the digits. Let me check the digits again. \n\na=8, b=6, c=3. So the number is 863. \n\nCheck the sum of digits: 8+6+3=17. Correct. \n\nSum of squares: 64 + 36 +9 = 109. Correct. \n\n863-495 = 368, which is the reverse. \n\nHmm, so the answer isn't in the options. But the options given are A to E, none of which is 863. Wait, the options are:\n\nA)368 (the reverse number)\n\nB)377 \n\nC)288 \n\nD)997 \n\nE)112 \n\nHmm. So perhaps I made an error in the setup. Let me check each option to see if any of them fit the conditions. \n\nLet me check option C: 288. \n\nDigits: 2, 8, 8. \n\nSum is 2+8+8=18. Not 17. So no. \n\nOption B: 377. \n\n3+7+7=17. That's good. \n\nSum of squares: 9+49+49= 107. Not 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption A: 368. \n\n3+6+8=17. \n\nSum of squares: 9+36+64= 109. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the sum here. \n\nWait, so 368's digits sum to 17, squares sum to 109. But then, if the original number is 368, subtract 495 would be 368-495 = negative number. Which can't be. \n\nWait, but the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. So the original number must be larger than 495. \n\nSo 368 is less than 495, so that can't be. \n\nWait, but if the original number is 863 (as I found), then subtracting gives 368. But since 863 isn't an option, maybe I have to check other options. \n\nLet me check option D: 997. \n\nDigits:9+9+7=25. Not 17. \n\nOption E:112: sum is 4, no. \n\nOption B:377. Sum is 17, but squares sum to 9+49+49= 107. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me check if there's another solution. Because maybe there was an error in solving the quadratic. \n\nThe quadratic equation was 3c\u00b2 -19c +30 =0. Let me compute discriminant: D= 361 - 360 =1. Wait wait, discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. \n\nWait, equation is 3c\u00b2 -19c +30=0. \n\nDiscriminant D = (-19)^2 -4*3*30 = 361 - 360 =1. \n\nSo sqrt(D)=1. \n\nThus, the roots are [19 \u00b11]/6. \n\nSo (19+1)/6=20/6=10/3\u22483.333, which is not a digit. \n\nOr (19-1)/6=18/6=3. So c=3 is the only solution. \n\nHmm. So no other solutions. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that I considered a three-digit number where a is the hundreds digit. But when you reverse, maybe leading zeros are allowed? Like, if the original number is 803, then reversed is 308. But in the problem statement, the reverse must be a three-digit number as well. Because subtracting 495 from a three-digit number (assuming it's at least 495) would give another three-digit number. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, but according to the problem, the number is three-digit. So the reverse must also be three-digit. So c can't be zero. \n\nWait, but in my solution, c is 3. So that's okay. \n\nHmm. So perhaps the options are wrong, but that's unlikely. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, let me re-express the third condition again. \n\nThe problem states that when you subtract 495 from the number, you get the reverse. \n\nSo N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nTherefore, reverse(N) = N -495. \n\nThus, reverse(N) must be less than N. \n\nWhich is true in the case of 863 -495=368, which is reverse. \n\nBut 863 isn't an option. \n\nHmm. Maybe the problem was in the direction of the subtraction? \n\nWait, perhaps the problem says that subtracting 495 gives the reverse. So N - 495 = reverse(N). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the reverse minus the number is 495? But the problem says subtract 495 from the number. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in the other direction: the reverse minus the original number is 495? \n\nWait, the problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" \n\nSo N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo the original number must be bigger than 495. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let's check option C: 288. \n\n288 -495 is negative. Not possible. \n\nOption B:377. 377-495 is negative. \n\nOption A:368-495 is negative. \n\nSo only option D:997 and E:112 are left. \n\nBut 997-495 is 502. The reverse of 997 is 799. 502 is not 799. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, so none of the options satisfy the conditions except my original solution of 863, which is not listed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"the sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109.\" \n\nLet me check option B: 377. \n\nDigits sum: 3+7+7=17. Correct. \n\nSum of squares: 9+49+49= 107. Not 109. \n\nClose but not exactly. \n\nOption C:288 \u2192 2+8+8=18. \n\nNo. \n\nOption D:997 \u2192 sum is 25. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption A:368 \u2192 sum 3+6+8=17. \n\nSum of squares: 9+36+64=109. \n\nWait a second! Oh! \n\nWait, 3+6+8 is 17, and squares sum to 109. So that's exactly the first two conditions. \n\nBut then, the problem says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. \n\nSo if the number is 368, subtracting 495 would give a negative number. But 368 is the reverse of the original number. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's third condition. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" \n\nWait, maybe the number is such that when you subtract 495, you get the reverse. \n\nSo if the original number is N, then N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo for N=368, reverse(N)=863. \n\nBut 368-495 is -127, which is not 863. \n\nSo that's not correct. \n\nWait, but if the original number is 863, then 863-495=368, which is the reverse. So that's correct, but 863 is not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution steps. \n\nLet me try to test the options given. \n\nTake option C:288. \n\nCheck the three conditions. \n\nSum digits: 2+8+8=18 \u226017 \u2192 no. \n\nOption B:377. \n\nSum digits:17. \n\nSum squares:3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107 \u2260109. \n\nClose but no. \n\nOption A:368. \n\nSum digits:17. \n\nSum squares:9+36+64=109. \n\nThird condition: 368-495= -127, which is not the reverse (which would be 863). \n\nSo that's invalid. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, is there another possible solution? Let me see. \n\nWait, the quadratic equation gives only one valid solution (c=3). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was an error in the equation setup. \n\nWait, the third equation: \n\nThe original number minus 495 equals the reverse. \n\nSo N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nSo N - reverse(N) =495. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the difference between the number and its reverse is 495. \n\nWait, in my previous solution, the difference between 863 and 368 is 495. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nBut the question says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. Which is exactly that. \n\nSo the original number must be N = reverse(N) +495. \n\nSo the difference N - reverse(N) =495. \n\nHmm. \n\nNow, perhaps there are other numbers where the difference between the number and its reverse is 495. \n\nLet me think. \n\nLet me see for other possible a and c where a -c=5. \n\nWait, because from equation a -c=5. \n\nSo possible c can be from 0 to 9, but a has to be a digit (1-9) so c can be up to 4 (since a =c+5 can't exceed 9. So c can be up to 4 (since 4+5=9). \n\nWait, in my previous solution, c was 3. \n\nWhat if c=4? Then a=9. \n\nLet me see if that gives another solution. \n\nLet me try c=4. \n\nThen a=9. \n\nFrom equation 1: a +b +c =17 \u2192 9 +b +4 =17 \u2192 b=4. \n\nThen check the sum of squares: 9\u00b2 +4\u00b2 +4\u00b2 =81 +16 +16= 113 \u2260109. \n\nNo. \n\nc=2: a=7. \n\nThen equation1:7 +b +2 =17 \u2192 b=8. \n\nSum of squares: 49 +64 +4 = 117. Not 109. \n\nc=1: a=6 \u2192 6 +b+1 =17 \u2192 b=10 \u2192 but b has to be a single digit. Not possible. \n\nc=0 \u2192 a=5 \u2192 5 +b+0=17 \u2192 b=12 \u2192 invalid. \n\nSo the only possible c is 3. \n\nSo the only solution is 863, which isn't in the options. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the problem's third condition. Let me read it again. \n\n\"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" \n\nWait, maybe the reverse is written in the same digits, but not necessarily the exact reverse? Or maybe the digits are the same but rearranged? \n\nWait, the problem says \"written in the reverse order\". So the exact reverse. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question is in another way: the number minus 495 gives the reverse, so N - reverse(N) =495. \n\nWait, that's the same as before. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the options again. \n\nWait, option B:377. \n\nReverse is 773. \n\n377 -495 = -118. Not 773. \n\nOption C:288 \u2192 reverse is 882. 288-495 is -207. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption D:997 \u2192 reverse is 799. 997-495=502 \u2260799. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, is there another way this could work? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the reverse is the number minus 495, but the number is smaller than 495, so the reverse would have a leading zero? \n\nFor example, if the number is 368, subtract 495 gives -127, but the reverse would be 863, but that's not equal to -127. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the equation setup. Let me try to set up the equation again. \n\nLet me denote the original number as 100a +10b +c. \n\nThe reverse is 100c +10b +a. \n\nThe problem says that N -495 = reverse. \n\nThus, \n\n100a +10b +c -495 = 100c +10b +a \n\nSubtracting gives:\n\n99a -99c =495 \u2192 a -c =5. Correct. \n\nSo that's right. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the options are wrong? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the sum of squares. \n\nWait, let me recheck the sum of squares for 863: 8\u00b2 +6\u00b2 +3\u00b2 =64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nYes. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the number is 863, and the options are wrong? But that's unlikely. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation for the sum of squares. Let me see. \n\nWait, the problem says the sum of squares of digits is 109. So for 863 it is correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me look at option B:377. \n\nSum of squares is 9+49+49=107. \n\nIf I had made a mistake in the problem's sum of squares as 107, then maybe 377 is the answer, but the problem says 109. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. \n\nOptions are: \n\nA)368 \n\nB)377 \n\nC)288 \n\nD)997 \n\nE)112 \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me check option C: 288. \n\nDigits 2,8,8. \n\nSum is 18, so no. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem's options, but given that the user provided them, I have to choose from the given options. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the quadratic. Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps when I set up the equation for the sum of squares, I missed a term. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the sum of squares equation again. \n\nOriginal substitution: \n\na =c+5 \n\nb=12-2c \n\nSo a squared is (c+5)^2 \n\nb squared is (12-2c)^2 \n\nc squared is c\u00b2 \n\nSum: \n\n(c+5)^2 + (12-2c)^2 +c\u00b2 \n\nWait, that's correct. \n\nWait, let me compute for c=3. \n\n(c+5)^2 =8\u00b2=64 \n\n(12-2c)^2 when c=3 is (12-6)=6 \u2192 36 \n\nc squared is 9 \n\nTotal:64+36+9=109. Correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo the only possible solution is 863, which is not in the options. \n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. \n\nWait, the problem says \"three digit number\"\u2014so the original number must be three digits. \n\nThe reverse of it is also a three-digit number. \n\nSo when subtracting 495, it must be a three-digit number. \n\nSo the original number must be at least 495 +100=595 (so that subtracting 495 gives at least 100). \n\nSo 863 is okay. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different solution where a -c is not 5? \n\nWait, the third condition gave us a -c =5. \n\nSo that's fixed. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different third condition. \n\nWait, the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. \n\nWait, maybe I have to subtract the reverse from the number to get 495? \n\nWait, if the problem had said \"the difference between the number and its reverse is 495\", then N - reverse(N)=495, which is what I have. \n\nSo that's the same as the given condition. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in the other direction: reverse(N) - N =495, which would mean the number is smaller. \n\nLet me check that possibility. \n\nSuppose reverse(N) - N =495. \n\nThen the equation would be (100c +10b +a) - (100a +10b +c) =495 \n\nWhich is 99c -99a =495 \u2192 c -a =5 \u2192 a =c-5 \n\nBut then a has to be at least 1, so c must be at least 6. \n\nLet me try this approach. \n\nLet me re-derive the equations with this new condition. \n\nAssume that reverse(N) -N =495. \n\nThen, the equations would be: \n\n1. a +b +c=17 \n\n2. a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109 \n\n3. c -a =5 \u2192 c= a +5 \n\nNow, substituting equation3 into the others. \n\nEquation1: a +b + (a+5) =17 \u2192 2a +b +5=17 \u21922a +b=12 \u2192b=12-2a \n\nEquation2: a\u00b2 + (12-2a)^2 + (a+5)^2=109 \n\nLet's expand each term: \n\na\u00b2 \n\n(12-2a)^2 = 144 -48a +4a\u00b2 \n\n(a+5)^2 =a\u00b2 +10a +25 \n\nAdding all together: \n\na\u00b2 + (144-48a+4a\u00b2) + (a\u00b2+10a+25) \n\nTotal terms: \n\na\u00b2+4a\u00b2+a\u00b2=6a\u00b2 \n\n-48a +10a =-38a \n\n144+25=169 \n\nSo equation is 6a\u00b2 -38a +169 =109 \n\nSubtract 109: \n\n6a\u00b2 -38a +60 =0 \u2192 divide by 2 \u21923a\u00b2 -19a +30=0 \n\nDiscriminant D= 361 - 360 =1 \n\nSolutions: [19 \u00b11]/6 \n\nSo (19+1)/6=20/6\u22483.333 \u2192 not integer \n\n(19-1)/6=18/6=3 \u2192 a=3 \n\nThus, a=3 \n\nThen c= a+5=8 \n\nb=12-2a=12-6=6 \n\nSo digits a=3, b=6, c=8 \u2192 number is 368. \n\nCheck sum digits:3+6+8=17. \n\nSum of squares:9+36+64=109. \n\nReverse(N) - N = 863 -368=495. \n\nSo this satisfies the condition reverse(N) - N=495. \n\nBut the problem states that subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. \n\nWait, in this case, N=368. \n\n368 -495 =-127, which is not the reverse (863). \n\nHowever, the reverse minus N is 495. \n\nSo this is a different equation. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo if the problem had said that the reverse is 495 more than the number, then the answer would be 368, which is option A. \n\nBut the problem says subtracting 495 from the number gives the reverse. \n\nSo 368 is not the correct answer under the original problem's condition. \n\nBut perhaps the problem had a typo, and the third condition is the reverse minus the number equals 495. In that case, the answer is option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem's third condition. \n\nWait, the problem says: \"If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.\" \n\nSo N -495 = reverse(N). \n\nBut in this scenario with N=368, that would require 368-495=reverse(N) \u2192 reverse(N) is -127, which is impossible. \n\nThus, the only possible solution is 863, which is not listed. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, the options given include option B:377. \n\nLet me see what happens if the number is 377. \n\nReverse is 773. \n\n377-495= -118. Not 773. \n\nHmm. \n\nOption C:288. \n\nReverse is 882. 288-495= -207. \n\nNo. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem was to add 495? \n\nIf the problem had said adding 495 gives the reverse, then N +495 = reverse(N). \n\nLet's see for N=368: 368+495=863, which is the reverse. \n\nIn that case, the answer would be 368 (option A). \n\nBut the problem says subtracting. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options, and the correct answer is 863, but since it's not there, perhaps the closest option is A (368), but that doesn't fit the subtraction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the quadratic solution. \n\nWait, let me try option B:377. \n\nLet me see if there's a different way to get that. \n\nSuppose the equations are: \n\na +b +c =17 \n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109 \n\nand a -c=5 (from the first interpretation). \n\nThen, for 377, a=3, b=7, c=7. \n\nCheck a-c =3-7= -4, which is not 5. \n\nSo that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the third condition's equation is different. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, let me think differently. \n\nSuppose the number is N = 100a +10b +c. \n\nThe reverse is 100c +10b +a. \n\nSubtracting 495 from N gives the reverse: \n\nN -495 = reverse \u2192 \n\nSo N - reverse =495 \u2192 \n\n(100a +10b +c) - (100c +10b +a) =495 \u2192 \n\n99a -99c =495 \u2192 a -c=5 \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo equations are correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe problem must have the correct answer as 863, but since it's not in the options, perhaps the options are wrong. But since this is a multiple-choice question and the user provided the options, I must choose the closest possible. \n\nWait, option B is 377. Let me check the sum of squares again. \n\n3\u00b2 +7\u00b2+7\u00b2 = 9+49+49 = 107. Which is close to 109 but not exactly. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation for the quadratic. Let me recheck the steps. \n\nWait, when I substituted b=12-2c into the squares equation, let's see for option B: 377. \n\nIf a=3, c=7 (since a -c= -4, which isn't 5). \n\nWait, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should try each option and see if any of them fit all conditions. \n\nOption A:368 \u2192 digits 3,6,8 \n\nSum:17, squares sum 109. \n\nBut N -495 = 368-495 = -127, which is not the reverse (863). \n\nSo that's invalid. \n\nOption B:377 \u2192 sum digits 17, squares sum 107. So not 109. \n\nOption C:288 \u2192 sum 18, no. \n\nOption D:997 \u2192 sum 25, no. \n\nE:112 \u2192 sum 4, no. \n\nSo none of them except 368 and 377 have the first two conditions, but they fail the third. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's third condition. Maybe the difference between the number and the reverse is 495, regardless of direction. \n\nSo either N - reverse =495 or reverse - N=495. \n\nIn that case, both 863 and 368 would satisfy that. \n\nBut the problem specifies subtracting 495 from the number to get the reverse. \n\nThus, the only possible solution is 863, but it's not in the options. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, the options might have a mistake. But since this is a problem from somewhere, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. \n\nWait, let me try another approach. \n\nLet me list all three-digit numbers where the digits sum to 17 and the squares sum to 109. \n\nLet me see. \n\nLooking for a, b, c digits (a from 1-9, b and c 0-9) such that a +b +c=17 and a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109. \n\nLet me think of possible triplets. \n\nStart with a=9: \n\nThen b +c =8 \n\na\u00b2=81 \n\nSo b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109-81=28 \n\nLooking for two numbers b and c adding to 8, with squares adding to28. \n\nPossible pairs: \n\n0+8 \u2192 squares 0+64=64>28 \n\n1+7 \u21921+49=50>28 \n\n2+6 \u21924+36=40 \n\n3+5 \u21929+25=34 \n\n4+4 \u219216+16=32 \n\nNone of these give 28. \n\na=8: \n\nb +c=9 \n\na\u00b2=64 \n\nThus, b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=109-64=45 \n\nLooking for two numbers adding to9 with squares adding to45. \n\nPossible pairs: \n\n0+9 \u21920+81=81>45 \n\n1+8 \u21921+64=65 \n\n2+7 \u21924+49=53 \n\n3+6 \u21929+36=45 \u2192 yes! \n\nSo b=3, c=6 or vice versa. \n\nSo digits could be 8,3,6 \u2192 sum is 17. \n\nSo numbers are 836, 863, 386, etc. \n\nWait, since a=8, the hundreds digit is 8. \n\nSo possible numbers are 836, 863. \n\nAlso, if b and c are 6 and3, same. \n\nCheck sum of squares: 8\u00b2+3\u00b2+6\u00b2=64+9+36=109. \n\nYes. \n\nSo these numbers (836 and 863) meet the first two conditions. \n\nNow check the third condition. \n\nTake 836: subtract 495 \u2192 836-495=341. \n\nReverse of 836 is 638. 341 \u2260638. \n\n863-495=368, which is the reverse. So that's correct. \n\nOther numbers: \n\nIf a=7, then b +c=10 \n\na squared is 49 \n\nsum of squares:109-49=60 \n\nLooking for two numbers adding to10 with squares adding to60. \n\nPossible pairs: \n\n0+10 \u2192 but c can't be 10 \n\n1+9 \u21921+81=82 \n\n2+8 \u21924+64=68 \n\n3+7 \u21929+49=58 \n\n4+6 \u219216+36=52 \n\n5+5 \u219225+25=50 \n\nNone add to60. \n\na=6: \n\nb +c=11 \n\na\u00b2=36 \n\nsum of squares:109-36=73 \n\nLooking for two numbers adding to11 with squares adding to73. \n\nPossible pairs: \n\n0+11 \u2192 no \n\n1+10 \u2192 no \n\n2+9 \u21924+81=85 \n\n3+8 \u21929+64=73 \u2192 yes. \n\nSo b=3, c=8 or b=8,c=3 \n\nThus numbers like 638, 683. \n\nCheck third condition. \n\nTake 638 \u2192 subtract 495 gives 638-495=143. Reverse is 836. 143\u2260836. \n\n683-495=188. Reverse is 386. Not equal. \n\nSo only 863 works. \n\nThus the correct answer is 863, but it's not listed. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, the options have 368. Maybe the question had a different third condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem was to add 445 instead of 495? \n\nWait, but I have to go with the given question. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's third condition. \n\nWait, the problem says subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse. \n\nIf the number is 368, the reverse is 863. \n\nSo 863 - 368 =495. \n\nAh! Wait a second! \n\nWait, maybe the question was phrased as \"the number minus its reverse is 495\". \n\nIn that case, N - reverse(N)=495 \u2192 which gives 863-368=495. \n\nBut the problem says \"subtract 495 from the number to get the reverse\". \n\nWhich would mean N -495 = reverse \u2192 which is correct for N=863. \n\nBut since it's not an option, perhaps the question had a typo and the number is 368, and the correct answer is A, but the third condition was reversed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem had a different third condition. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question says that when you add 495 to the number, you get the reverse. \n\nThen 368 +495= 863, which is the reverse. \n\nIn that case, the answer is 368 (option A). \n\nGiven that the problem's third condition is crucial here, and the options don't include 863, but option A is the reverse of the correct number, perhaps there was a mix-up in the question's subtraction/addition. \n\nAssuming that the problem might have said \"add 495\" instead of subtract, then option A is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. \n\nGiven that the options don't include the correct answer, but option A fits the first two conditions, maybe the intended answer is A)368. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different third condition. \n\nWait, let me recheck the problem's wording again: \n\n\"The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.\" \n\nSo the problem is as I thought. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that the correct answer is not among the options, but the closest is option A, which satisfies the first two conditions but not the third. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a typo and the third condition is the difference between the number and its reverse is 495, which would give 863-368=495. \n\nIn that case, the number could be either 863 or 368. Since 863 isn't an option, the answer would be A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem's third condition is that subtracting the reverse from the number gives 495, which would mean N - reverse(N) =495, so N is 863. \n\nSince it's not an option, I'm stuck. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. \n\nWait, let me try with the options given. \n\nLooking for a number that when subtracted by 495 gives its reverse. \n\nCheck option A:368 \n\n368-495= -127 \u2192 not reverse (863). \n\nOption B:377 \n\n377-495= -118 \u2192 no. \n\nC:288-495= -207 \u2192 no. \n\nD:997-495=502 \u2192 reverse is 799 \u2192 no. \n\nE:112-495= -383 \u2192 no. \n\nNone work. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo perhaps the problem is wrong, or I'm missing something. \n\nWait, let me think of another possible solution. \n\nSuppose a -c =5 \n\nFrom the first equations, the only solution was c=3, a=8, b=6. \n\nSo the number is 863. \n\nBut since it's not an option, perhaps the problem had a different digit sum or square sum. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the sum of squares for option B. \n\n377's squares:3\u00b2+7\u00b2+7\u00b2=9+49+49=107. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says the sum of squares is 107, then the answer would be B. \n\nBut the problem states 109. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. \n\nLet me list all possible three-digit numbers where digits sum to 17 and squares sum to 109. \n\nWe found two numbers: 836 and 863. \n\n836: digits 8,3,6. \n\nSum squares: 64+9+36=109. \n\nReverse is 638. \n\n836-495=341 \u2260638. \n\n863-495=368 (reverse). \n\nSo only 863 meets all conditions. \n\nSince it's not an option, I think the problem must have a typo. \n\nBut given the options, the closest is option A, which is the reverse of the correct number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question's third condition is the reverse of the number minus the number equals 495, so 863-368=495. \n\nIn that case, the number could be either 863 or 368. \n\nSince 863 isn't an option, the answer must be A. \n\nTherefore, I'll choose option A as the answer, assuming there was a mistake in the problem's condition direction.\n\n\nThe problem requires finding a three-digit number where the sum of its digits is 17, the sum of the squares of its digits is 109, and subtracting 495 from the number gives its reverse. \n\nLet the digits be \\(a\\) (hundreds), \\(b\\) (tens), and \\(c\\) (units). The equations derived are:\n1. \\(a + b + c = 17\\)\n2. \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109\\)\n3. \\(a - c = 5\\) (from \\(N - 495 = \\text{reverse}(N)\\))\n\nSubstituting \\(a = c + 5\\) into the first equation gives \\(b = 12 - 2c\\). Substituting these into the second equation yields a quadratic equation, which solves to \\(c = 3\\), \\(a = 8\\), and \\(b = 6\\). This gives the number 863, which satisfies all conditions except it is not listed in the options.\n\nChecking the options provided:\n- **A) 368**: Sums to 17 and squares to 109 but fails the subtraction condition.\n- **B) 377**: Fails the squares sum (107 \u2260 109).\n- **C) 288**: Incorrect digit sum (18 \u2260 17).\n- **D) 997**: Incorrect digit sum (25 \u2260 17).\n- **E) 112**: Incorrect digit sum (4 \u2260 17).\n\nGiven the problem's constraints and options, the closest valid answer under possible misinterpretations (e.g., reversing the subtraction direction) is **A) 368**, as it meets the first two conditions and is the reverse of the correct number.\n\nAnswer: A",
