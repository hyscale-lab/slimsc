      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a canal's cross-section being a trapezium. Let me think. The question is asking for the depth of the canal. The given information is that the top width is 10 meters, the bottom is 6 meters, and the cross-sectional area is 640 square meters. Hmm, right. \n\nFirst, I remember that the formula for the area of a trapezoid is (a + b)/2 multiplied by the height, which in this case would be the depth of the canal. Wait, right. The formula is Area = (sum of the two parallel sides) divided by 2, times the height between them. Here, the two parallel sides are the top and bottom widths of the canal. \n\nSo the top is 10 m, bottom is 6 m. Let me plug those numbers into the formula. The area given is 640 m\u00b2. Let me write that down:\n\nArea = ( (a + b)/2 ) * h\n640 = (10 + 6)/2 * h\n\nWait, solving for h here. Let me compute the sum first. 10 plus 6 is 16. Divided by 2 gives 8. So the equation becomes 640 = 8 * h. To find h, divide both sides by 8. \n\nSo h = 640 / 8 = 80? Wait, but 8 times 80 is 640. That would make the depth 80 meters? That seems really deep for a canal. Like, 80 meters is over 200 feet, which is way too much. Maybe I did something wrong here. \n\nLet me check again. The formula is correct, right? The area of a trapezoid is indeed (a + b)/2 times the height. The height here is the depth perpendicular to the bases. So maybe the problem is in the units? The problem states meters, so that's okay. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read again. The cross-section is a trapezium (which is a trapezoid in American terms). The top is 10m, bottom 6m. The area is 640. So according to the formula, the calculation is correct. But 80 meters is way too large. That can't be right. Maybe the question meant the cross-sectional area per meter length? Wait, no, the question says cross-section area is 640 square meters. Wait, that's a lot. \n\nWait, maybe the units are mixed? Let me see. The options given are A)26, B)28, C)21, D)80, E)23. Oh, option D is 80, which is exactly what I calculated. But that seems way too big. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula? Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is a trapezoid but the depth is the height. Let me re-calculate. \n\nArea = ( (a + b)/2 ) * h. \nSo h = (2 * Area)/(a + b). \n\nPlugging in the numbers: 2*640/(10+6) = 1280/16 = 80. So that's the same result. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the question is in meters, but the cross-sectional area is 640 m\u00b2, which would mean that if the canal is, say, 1 meter deep, then the cross-section area would be (10+6)/2 *1 = 8 m\u00b2. But here it's 640. So unless the canal is 80 meters deep, which is possible if it's a very large canal? But even then, canals are usually not that deep. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. Wait, the cross-section's area is 640 square meters? That's the cross-sectional area. So if the canal is, for example, 10m wide at top, 6m at bottom, and depth h, then the cross-section area is (10+6)/2 * h = 8h. \n\nSo 8h = 640 \u2192 h = 80. So the answer must be D. But maybe the question had a typo and the area is 640 square meters per meter? But no, the question says cross-section area is 640. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section is not the side but the horizontal? No, the cross-section of a canal would be the vertical cross-section. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm confusing trapezium with another shape? In British English, trapezium can sometimes refer to a quadrilateral with no sides parallel, but in the context of a canal's cross-section, it's more likely a trapezoid (with two sides parallel). So the formula applies. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 80. So unless the problem has a mistake, but the math checks out. Maybe the answer is D. But why do the other options seem smaller? Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in arithmetic. Let me compute 640 divided by 8 again. 8 times 80 is 640, yes. So that's correct. So maybe the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in meters but the area is given in some other unit? Like square kilometers? But the question says square meters. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the depth is not the height? Like, if the sides are slanting, but the depth is vertical. The formula still uses the vertical height. So unless the problem is referring to the slant height, but that would not be standard. \n\nHmm. Well, given the options, D is 80, which matches the calculation. So maybe the answer is D. But I'm a bit unsure because 80 meters seems too deep. However, perhaps in some engineering contexts, canals can be that deep? Like in large irrigation canals or something? I'm not sure, but mathematically, the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The question says the cross-section is a trapezium. The canal is 10m wide at the top, 6m at the bottom. The cross-section area is 640. The depth is? \n\nYes. So unless there's a misunderstanding, the answer is D. But maybe the question meant the cross-sectional area per unit length? Wait, if that's the case, then the area would be in m\u00b2 per meter, so 640 m\u00b2/m would be 640, but that would still give the same result. Wait, no, maybe the question is saying the cross-sectional area per meter length. Then the cross-sectional area (per meter) would be (10+6)/2 * h. If that's 640, then h is 80. But 640 m\u00b2/m would be 640 per meter, but that's not standard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question had a typo and the area is 64 m\u00b2 instead of 640? Let's see. If it were 64, then h would be 8. But that's not an option. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the numbers. Let me check again. The canal is 10m wide at the top, 6 at the bottom. Area cross-section is 640. \n\nHmm. Well, given the options, the only possible answer that fits the calculation is D)80. So I think that's the answer, even though it's a bit counterintuitive. Maybe the problem is designed that way. \n\nSo the correct answer must be D.\n",
