      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. The least integer is -50, and I need to find what k is. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they're consecutive, the difference between each term is 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 multiplied by (first term + last term). So, maybe I can set that up here.\n\nThe first term is given as -50. The last term would be the first term plus (k-1) because each term increases by 1. Wait, right. So the last term is -50 + (k - 1). Let me write that down.\n\nSum = k/2 * [first term + last term]\n51 = (k/2) * [ (-50) + (-50 + k - 1) ]\n\nLet me simplify the expression inside the brackets. The last term is (-50 + k -1) which is (k -51). So adding the first term and last term: (-50) + (k -51) = k - 101.\n\nSo plugging back into the equation: 51 = (k/2)(k -101). \n\nHmm, so that's a quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n102 = k(k - 101)\n\nExpanding the right side gives: 102 = k\u00b2 - 101k\n\nBring all terms to one side: k\u00b2 -101k -102 = 0.\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let me see if I can factor it. Let's look for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add up to -101. Wait, the product is -102, so factors could be 1 and -102? Because 1 * (-102) = -102, and 1 + (-102) = -101. Yes! That works.\n\nSo the equation factors as (k - 102)(k +1) = 0. Because expanding that would give k\u00b2 -101k -102. Wait, let me check:\n\n(k -102)(k +1) = k\u00b2 +k -102k -102 = k\u00b2 -101k -102. Yep, that's right.\n\nSo the solutions are k =102 or k = -1. But since the number of terms can't be negative, k must be 102. But wait, let me check the options. Option E is 102. Hmm, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in my steps.\n\nWait, let me verify the sum when k is 102. The first term is -50. The last term would be -50 + (102 -1) = -50 +101 = 51. So the terms go from -50 up to 51. Let's compute the sum. The number of terms is 102. The average of the first and last term is (-50 +51)/2 = 1/2. Multiply by the number of terms: 102 * (1/2) = 51. That's exactly the sum given. So that checks out.\n\nBut wait, the options also include 102 as E. So that seems correct. But wait, let me see if any of the other options could work. Let me try another option just to be sure. Let's pick another option, like option C)82. Let's see what would happen.\n\nIf k were 82, then the last term would be -50 +81 = 31. Then the sum would be (82/2)*(-50 +31) = 41*(-19) = -779. Which is way off. So that's not right.\n\nWhat about option D)92? Let's see. Last term is -50 +91 =41. Sum would be (92/2)*(-50 +41) =46*(-9)= -414. Not 51.\n\nHmm, so 102 seems correct. But let me check again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in forming the equation. Let me retrace the steps.\n\nThe first term is -50, the last term is first + (k-1)*1, so that's -50 +k -1 =k-51. Then the sum is (k/2)(-50 + (k-51)). Wait, that's exactly what I did before. So the equation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach: the sum from n = a to n = b of integers is equal to (b -a +1)*(a + b)/2. Here a is -50, and the number of terms is k. So the last term is b = -50 + (k-1). So substituting into the formula:\n\nSum = k*(-50 + b)/2 = 51. But since b is -50 +k -1, so substituting that in gives the same equation.\n\nAlternatively, think of the sequence starting at -50 and having k terms. The terms are -50, -49, ..., up to (-50 +k-1). The average of the sequence is (first + last)/2, and multiplied by the number of terms gives the sum. So that's exactly the formula I used.\n\nHmm, so the answer is 102, which is option E. But wait, let me check again because the options include 102 as E. The problem says \"the least integer is -50\", so the starting point is -50, and the next terms go up by 1 each time. So when k is 102, the last term is 51, as I calculated. So adding all numbers from -50 to 51 inclusive. Let me count how many terms that is. From -50 to 0 is 50 numbers (since -50 to -1 is 50 terms?), then from 1 to 51 is 51 terms, plus the 0. So total 50 +1 (the zero) +51= 102 terms. That makes sense. The sum of numbers from -50 to 50 would be zero because they cancel out. Then adding 51 gives 51. Exactly. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer must be E)102. Wait, but let me check if maybe I misread the question. The question says \"the sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50...\" So that's exactly what I did. So yeah, I think that's correct. So the correct answer is E.\n",

So the last term is b = -50 + (k-1). So substituting into the formula:\n\nSum = k*(-50 + b)/2 = 51.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the number of consecutive integers, k, that add up to 51, and the smallest integer in that sequence is -50. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you have a sequence of consecutive integers, the sum can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is S = n/2 * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. But since these are consecutive integers, the difference between each term is 1. \n\nWait, but here the first term is given as -50. The question is asking for k, which is the number of terms. The sum S is 51. So I need to set up an equation here. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, another formula for the sum of consecutive integers starting at a1 and having k terms is: S = k * (a1 + a_k)/2. Since the integers are consecutive, the last term a_k can be written as a1 + (k-1)*d, where d is the common difference. Since they are consecutive integers, d=1. So a_k = a1 + k -1. \n\nPutting that into the sum formula: S = k*(a1 + a1 + k -1)/2. \n\nWe know S is 51, and a1 is -50. Let me plug those values in. \n\nSo substituting, 51 = k*(-50 + (-50) + k -1)/2. Wait, let me make sure I get the substitution right. Let me rewrite the equation step by step.\n\nThe sum S is equal to (number of terms) multiplied by (first term plus last term) divided by 2. \n\nSo:\n\n51 = k/2 * [ (-50) + (last term) ]\n\nThe last term is the starting term plus (k-1)*1, so that's (-50) + (k-1). \n\nSo substituting that into the equation:\n\n51 = k/2 * [ (-50) + (-50 + k -1) ]\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets:\n\n-50 + (-50 + k -1) = -50 -50 -1 +k = (-101) + k. \n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\n51 = (k/2) * (k - 101)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n102 = k*(k - 101)\n\nSo expanding the right side: k^2 - 101k = 102\n\nBring all terms to one side: k^2 -101k -102 = 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation. Let's try to factor this. Hmm, looking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add up to -101. Wait, the factors of 102 are 1 & 102, 2 &51, 3 &34, 6 &17. Since the product is negative, one is positive and the other negative. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the numbers are (k - 102)(k +1) = 0? Let me check:\n\n(k - 102)(k +1) = k^2 +k -102k -102 = k^2 -101k -102. Yes, that's exactly the equation. \n\nSo the solutions are k = 102 or k = -1. Since k can't be negative, the answer must be 102. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 102, so that would be the answer. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have messed up a step.\n\nWait another thought: Let's verify this. Let me plug k=102 into the original equation to see if the sum is 51.\n\nFirst term is -50. The last term is -50 + (102-1) = -50 + 101 = 51. Wait, so the last term is 51?\n\nThen the sum would be (number of terms)/2 * (first + last) = 102/2 * (-50 +51) = 51 *1 =51. Oh, that's exactly the sum given. So that checks out. \n\nHmm, so that's correct. But let me check if there's another possible solution. The quadratic had another root at k = -1, which we can ignore. \n\nWait, but the options include E)102. So that's one of the choices, so the answer must be E. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem says \"k consecutive integers\" starting from -50, so how does that sequence look? Let's see: The numbers start at -50 and go up by 1 each term for 102 terms. The last term would be -50 + 101 =51. The average of the sequence is (-50 +51)/2 =0.5. Multiply by the number of terms (102) gives 51. So yes, that's exactly right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Like, the sum from -50 up to some number n is 51. Let me think of the sum from -50 to n being 51. The number of terms would be (n - (-50) ) +1 = n +51. \n\nThe sum of integers from a to b inclusive is (b -a +1)(a + b)/2. \n\nSo setting that equal to 51:\n\n(n +51) * ( (-50) + n ) /2 =51 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2: (n+51)(n -50) = 102 \n\nExpand the left side: n^2 + 1n -50*51 -50n +51n -50*51? Wait maybe better to multiply directly:\n\n(n +51)(n -50) = n^2 -50n +51n -50*51 = n\u00b2 +n -2550 \n\nSet equal to 102: n\u00b2 +n -2550 = 102 \u2192 n\u00b2 +n -2652=0 \n\nHmm, solving this quadratic for n. Let me see if that gives the same result as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me see. Wait, maybe this approach is getting more complicated, but since the first method worked, maybe I should stick with that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach: The sum of consecutive numbers from -50 to some number x is 51. \n\nThe sum can also be thought of as the sum from 1 to x minus the sum from 1 to (-50 -1) [since negatives are included]. Wait, maybe that's more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence starts at -50 and has k terms. The terms are -50, -49, ..., up to (-50 +k -1). The sum is 51. \n\nAlternatively, the sum can be written as the sum from n = -50 to n = (-50 +k -1) of n. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total sum is equal to the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms, which is exactly the formula I used before. \n\nSo, since that method worked and the check with k=102 gives the correct sum, I think E)102 is the right answer. Let me check the options again. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So yes, E is an option. \n\nWait a second, but let me make sure there's no other solution. Suppose someone thought the sequence starts at -50 and ends at 50, but that might be a common mistake. Let's see: if the last term was 50, then the number of terms would be 50 - (-50) +1 = 101 terms. The sum would be (101)*( -50 +50)/2 = 0. That's not 51. So that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, if the last term is 51, then the number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1 = 102, which matches the previous solution. \n\nSo I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be E)102.\n",

Let me rewrite the equation step by step.\n\nThe sum S is equal to (number of terms) multiplied by (first term plus last term) divided by 2. \n\nSo:\n\n51 = k/2 * [ (-50) + (last term) ]\n\nThe last term is the starting term plus (k-1)*1, so that's (-50) + (k-1). \n\nSo substituting that into the equation:\n\n51 = k/2 * [ (-50) + (-50 + k -1) ]\n\nSimplify the terms inside the brackets:\n\n-50 + (-50 + k -1) = -50 -50 -1 +k = (-101) + k. \n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\n51 = (k/2) * (k - 101)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n102 = k*(k - 101)\n\nSo expanding the right side: k^2 - 101k = 102\n\nBring all terms to one side: k^2 -101k -102 = 0\n\nNow we have a quadratic equation. Let's try to factor this. Hmm, looking for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add up to -101. Wait, the factors of 102 are 1 & 102, 2 &51, 3 &34, 6 &17. Since the product is negative, one is positive and the other negative. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the numbers are (k - 102)(k +1) = 0? Let me check:\n\n(k - 102)(k +1) = k^2 +k -102k -102 = k^2 -101k -102. Yes, that's exactly the equation. \n\nSo the solutions are k = 102 or k = -1. Since k can't be negative, the answer must be 102. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 102, so that would be the answer. But let me double-check because sometimes I might have messed up a step.\n\nWait another thought: Let's verify this. Let me plug k=102 into the original equation to see if the sum is 51.\n\nFirst term is -50. The last term is -50 + (102-1) = -50 + 101 = 51. Wait, so the last term is 51?\n\nThen the sum would be (number of terms)/2 * (first + last) = 102/2 * (-50 +51) = 51 *1 =51. Oh, that's exactly the sum given. So that checks out. \n\nHmm, so that's correct. But let me check if there's another possible solution. The quadratic had another root at k = -1, which we can ignore. \n\nWait, but the options include E)102. So that's one of the choices, so the answer must be E. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem says \"k consecutive integers\" starting from -50, so how does that sequence look? Let's see: The numbers start at -50 and go up by 1 each term for 102 terms. The last term would be -50 + 101 =51. The average of the sequence is (-50 +51)/2 =0.5. Multiply by the number of terms (102) gives 51. So yes, that's exactly right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Like, the sum from -50 up to some number n is 51. Let me think of the sum from -50 to n being 51. The number of terms would be (n - (-50) ) +1 = n +51. \n\nThe sum of integers from a to b inclusive is (b -a +1)(a + b)/2. \n\nSo setting that equal to 51:\n\n(n +51) * ( (-50) + n ) /2 =51 \n\nMultiply both sides by 2: (n+51)(n -50) = 102 \n\nExpand the left side: n^2 + 1n -50*51 -50n +51n -50*51? Wait maybe better to multiply directly:\n\n(n +51)(n -50) = n^2 -50n +51n -50*51 = n\u00b2 +n -2550 \n\nSet equal to 102: n\u00b2 +n -2550 = 102 \u2192 n\u00b2 +n -2652=0 \n\nHmm, solving this quadratic for n. Let me see if that gives the same result as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me see. Wait, maybe this approach is getting more complicated, but since the first method worked, maybe I should stick with that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach: The sum of consecutive numbers from -50 to some number x is 51. \n\nThe sum can also be thought of as the sum from 1 to x minus the sum from 1 to (-50 -1) [since negatives are included]. Wait, maybe that's more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, the sequence starts at -50 and has k terms. The terms are -50, -49, ..., up to (-50 +k -1). The sum is 51. \n\nAlternatively, the sum can be written as the sum from n = -50 to n = (-50 +k -1) of n. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the total sum is equal to the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms, which is exactly the formula I used before. \n\nSo, since that method worked and the check with k=102 gives the correct sum, I think E)102 is the right answer. Let me check the options again. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So yes, E is an option. \n\nWait a second, but let me make sure there's no other solution. Suppose someone thought the sequence starts at -50 and ends at 50, but that might be a common mistake. Let's see: if the last term was 50, then the number of terms would be 50 - (-50) +1 = 101 terms. The sum would be (101)*( -50 +50)/2 = 0. That's not 51. So that's not it. \n\nAlternatively, if the last term is 51, then the number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1 = 102, which matches the previous solution. \n\nSo I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer should be E)102.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum \\( S \\) of \\( k \\) consecutive integers starting from \\( a_1 \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (a_1 + a_k)\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( S = 51 \\), \\( a_1 = -50 \\), and the last term \\( a_k = -50 + (k - 1) \\). Substituting these values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\times \\left( -50 + (-50 + k - 1) \\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplifying inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n-50 + (-50 + k - 1) = k - 101\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (k - 101)\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\n102 = k(k - 101)\n\\]\n\nRearranging into a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\\]\n\nFactoring the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\n(k - 102)(k + 1) = 0\n\\]\n\nThe solutions are \\( k = 102 \\) and \\( k = -1 \\). Since \\( k \\) must be positive, we have \\( k = 102 \\). Verifying, the sequence from -50 to 51 (inclusive) has 102 terms, and their sum is indeed 51. \n\nAnswer: E)102.\n\n\\boxed{E}\n\nAnswer: E",
