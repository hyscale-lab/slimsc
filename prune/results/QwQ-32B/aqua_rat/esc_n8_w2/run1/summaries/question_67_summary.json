      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out how many grams of this health food someone needs to eat daily to get at least the minimum daily requirements for both vitamins E and A. Hmm.\n\nSo, the question says that one gram gives 9% of the daily E and 8% of the daily A. Wait, right. So each gram contributes both vitamins. The person can't get these vitamins from any other source, so they have to get all of their E and A from this food. The goal is to find the smallest number of grams that meets or exceeds the 100% requirement for both vitamins. \n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of grams as x. Then, the total vitamin E from x grams would be 9% times x, and the vitamin A would be 8% times x. Both of those need to be at least 100%, right? \n\nSo, the equations would be:\n0.09x \u2265 100% (for E)\n0.08x \u2265 100% (for A)\n\nWait, but percentages here. Let me make sure. Since 1 gram gives 9% of E's daily need, then x grams would give 9x percent of E. So, to reach 100%, 9x must be at least 100. Similarly for A: 8x must be at least 100.\n\nSo solving for x in both cases. Let's do that.\n\nFor E: 9x \u2265 100 \u2192 x \u2265 100/9 \u2248 11.111... grams.\n\nFor A: 8x \u2265 100 \u2192 x \u2265 100/8 = 12.5 grams.\n\nWait, so the E requires about 11.11 grams, but the A requires 12.5 grams. Since you can't eat a fraction of a gram (or maybe you can, but the question is about how many grams must be eaten to satisfy both), the person needs to take enough to cover the higher of the two. Because if you take 12.5 grams, then for E, that's 12.5 *9 = 112.5%, which is over the requirement, but that's okay. But for A, it's exactly 100%. \n\nAlternatively, if they took 11.11 grams, that would give enough E but only 8*11.11 = 88.88% of A, which is not enough. So the minimum needed is the higher of the two, which is 12.5 grams. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5. So the answer must be C. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the options are A)8.5, B)10.5, C)12.5, D)14.5, E)16.5. Yep. So 12.5 is there as option C. That makes sense. Because the A requires more grams than E. So you have to choose the higher value. \n\nHmm, I think that's correct. Let me just verify the calculations again. \n\nFor vitamin E: 100% divided by 9% per gram is 100/9 \u2248 11.11. So 11.11 grams would get exactly 100% E, but only 11.11 *8 = 88.88% A. Not enough. So to get A to 100%, 100/8 is 12.5. At that point, E is 12.5 *9=112.5%, which is over, but meets the requirement. So yes, 12.5 is the minimum needed. \n\nTherefore the answer should be C.\n",
