      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: there are 10 oranges in a basket, and I need to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges. The options are A)45, B)90, C)120, D)150, E)180. Hmm, let's think. \n\nFirst, I remember that when you're choosing items from a group and the order doesn't matter, you use combinations. Like, if you pick orange A and then orange B, that's the same as picking B then A. So combinations are the way to go here. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n - k)!).\n\nSo in this case, n is 10 oranges and k is 2. Plugging into the formula: 10! divided by (2! * (10-2)! ). Let me compute that. The 10! in the numerator and the (10-2)! which is 8! in the denominator will cancel out the 8! part of the 10!.\n\nSo 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! so when divided by 8! it leaves 10 \u00d79. Then divided by 2! which is 2. So (10\u00d79)/2 = 90/2 = 45. Wait, so that would be 45. So the answer is A)45?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Are there any exceptions here? The problem says \"chosen from the basket\" \u2014 does that imply anything different? Like, maybe the oranges are arranged in some way? Or maybe they are identical? But no, typically, unless specified, each orange is considered distinct. So choosing any two different ones would be a combination. \n\nAlternatively, if the question had said something like arranging them in order, then permutations would be the way, which would be 10\u00d79 =90. But the question says \"chosen\", which usually implies combination. So the answer should be 45, which is option A. \n\nLooking at the options, A is 45. So the answer must be A. Let me check once more. The formula for combinations is nCk = n!/(k!(n\u2212k)!). So 10C2 is 10*9/(2*1) =45. Yep. So the correct answer is A.\n",

I remember that combinations are used when the order doesn't matter. Like, if you're picking items and it doesn't matter which one comes first. Since choosing orange A and then orange B is the same as B then A here, right? So this should be a combination problem.\n\nThe formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n - k)!). So here, n is 10 and k is 2. Let me plug those numbers in. So 10 factorial over 2 factorial times (10-2) factorial. Wait, 10! divided by (2! * 8!). \n\nBut calculating 10 factorial all the way might be tedious, but maybe I can simplify. Since 10! is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! So when I divide by 8! it cancels out. So that leaves me with (10 \u00d7 9) / (2 \u00d7 1). Let me compute that. 10 times 9 is 90, divided by 2 gives 45. Oh right, so the answer should be 45, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up combinations and permutations. Permutations would be if the order matters, which uses n!/(n-k)! So that would be 10\u00d79=90, which is option B. But since the question is just about choosing two oranges, not arranging them in order, combinations are correct. So yeah, 45 is the right answer. The options have A as 45, so that's the one. I think that's solid.\n",
