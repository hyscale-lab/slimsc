      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is about two printers working together to print 100 pages. Let me see. Both printers A and B can each print 1/2 a page per second. Hmm, I need to find out how long it takes them together to print 100 pages.\n\nWait, right, when things work together, their rates add up. Like, if each printer does 1/2 page per second, then together they should add their rates. Let me think. So Printer A's rate is 0.5 pages per second, and Printer B is also 0.5. So combined, that's 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 page per second. Oh, right! So together, they can print 1 page every second.\n\nNow, the question is how long to print 100 pages. If they do 1 page per second, then for 100 pages, it would be 100 seconds? Wait, but let me make sure. Time is total pages divided by rate. So 100 pages divided by 1 page per second equals 100 seconds. So that would be option C. \n\nWait a second, but let me check the options again. The options are A)25, B)50, C)100, D)200, E)400. So yes, 100 is option C. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go through it again. Each printer does 1/2 page per second. So in one second, each does 0.5, so combined 1.0. So yes, that's right. So 100 pages would take 100 seconds. So the answer should be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. \"How long will it take both printers working together to print 100 pages?\" Yep, that's exactly what I did. So the answer is C. The options given include C as 100 seconds, so that's correct. I don't see any other possible way here. So I think the answer is C.\n",

So each printer's rate is 1/2 page per second. So if there are two of them, their combined rate should be 1/2 + 1/2. Let me calculate that. 1/2 plus 1/2 is 1. So together, they can print 1 page per second. \n\nWait, that makes sense. Because each does half a page every second, so together they make a full page each second. So the combined rate is 1 page per second. \n\nNow, the question is how long to print 100 pages. If they can do 1 page every second, then for 100 pages, it would take 100 seconds?

So the answer must be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think in terms of individual times. Like, if each printer alone would take how long? Let's see, if one printer does 1/2 page per second, then to do 1 page, it takes 2 seconds. So for 100 pages, one printer would take 200 seconds. But with two printers working together, their combined rate is double, so time is halved? Wait, 200 divided by 2 is 100. Which matches the previous answer. \n\nHmm, so that's consistent. So the answer should be C. Let me check if any other option makes sense. Like if someone thought the combined rate was additive differently. Wait, maybe someone might add 1/2 +1/2 and think that's 1 page per second, so 100 pages would take 100 seconds. So yeah, that's exactly what I did. So I think that's correct.
