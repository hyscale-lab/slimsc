      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about Peter wanting to form a scavenger hunt team. He needs 10 additional people, so that makes the team total 11 including himself. Wait, wait, the question says \"find 10 additional people to form a team with him.\" So the team will have Peter plus 10 friends, making 11 total. But he has exactly 10 friends who want to participate. Hmm, so he needs to choose 10 friends out of 10? Because he can't choose more than he has. Wait, but if there are exactly 10 friends, then he has to pick all of them. Because there's no other option. Like, if he needs 10 people and he has exactly 10 friends, then there's only one way to choose all of them. So the number of choices is 1. Let me think again.\n\nThe question is phrased as \"how many choices does he have for forming his team?\" The key here is combinations. The formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n!/(k!(n-k)!). Here, n is the number of friends available, which is 10. And he needs to choose k=10. So 10 choose 10 is 1. Because there's only one way to choose all of them. So the answer must be B)1. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read again. The problem says Peter wants to find 10 additional people. So he's already part of the team, so the team is 11 people. But his friends are the only ones available, and he has exactly 10 friends. So he can't get more than 10 friends. So he can't form a team of 10 additional people because he can't get enough. Wait, that's a different angle. Wait, if he has 10 friends who want to participate, but he needs 10 additional people. So the total required is 10, and he has exactly 10 friends. So he can choose all of them, so the team would be Peter plus those 10. So the number of ways is 10 choose 10 which is 1. So the answer is B. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where he can't form the team because he needs 10 but he only has 10? Wait no, he needs 10 additional, and he has 10 friends. So he can form the team by choosing all of them. So the number of choices is 1. So the correct answer is B. The options are A)0, B)1, etc. So yeah, B is the answer.\n",
