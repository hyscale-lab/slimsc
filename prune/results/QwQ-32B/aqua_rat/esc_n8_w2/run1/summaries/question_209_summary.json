      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: 900 plus 5 multiplied by 12. The options are A)820, B)202, C)420, D)209, E)960. Hmm, I need to remember the order of operations here. Wait, what's the correct order again? Oh right, parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So PEMDAS. \n\nSo in the problem 900 + 5 \u00d7 12, the multiplication part comes first. Let me calculate 5 times 12 first. 5 multiplied by 12 is 60. Then add that to 900. So 900 plus 60 equals 960. Let me check the options. Option E is 960. That must be the right answer. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the operations. If someone just did 900 plus 5 first, that would be 905 times 12, which is way bigger, but that's not the case here. No, multiplication has higher priority. Yeah, so the correct answer should be E)960.\n",
