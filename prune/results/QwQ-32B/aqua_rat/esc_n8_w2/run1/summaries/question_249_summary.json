      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for the sum of three consecutive integers, and their product is equal to the sum of 727, 728, and 729. Hmm, wait, no, actually, the problem says the product can be expressed as that sum. Wait, let me read again. Oh right, the product of the three consecutive integers is equal to 727 plus 728 plus 729. Or wait, maybe I misread. Let me parse the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"What is the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727+728+729.\" So the three consecutive integers have a product that's equal to the sum of those three numbers. Wait, no, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me think: the product of the three consecutive integers is equal to 727+728+729. And we have to find the sum of those three integers. \n\nFirst step, compute the sum of 727, 728, 729. Let me add those numbers. 727 plus 728 is 1455, plus 729 would be 1455 +729 = 2184. Wait, let me check again. 727 + 728 is (700+27) + (700+28) = 1400 + (27+28) = 1400 +55=1455. Then add 729: 1455 +729. 1455 +700 is 2155, plus 29 is 2184. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184. Now, find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184, then add them up and choose the correct option from the given choices.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding three consecutive integers x, x+1, x+2 such that x*(x+1)*(x+2) = 2184. Then their sum is x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 3x +3 = 3(x+1). So the sum would be 3 times the middle number, since the middle number is x+1. Alternatively, the average is the middle number, and multiplied by 3 gives the sum. So if I can find the middle number, then multiply by 3, that's the sum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can approximate. Let's see. Let's find the cube root of 2184 to get an estimate. The cube root of 2184. Let's see, 12^3 is 1728, 13^3 is 2197. Wait, 13 cubed is 2197, which is just a bit more than 2184. So maybe the numbers are around 12 or 13? Let's check.\n\nLet me try 12*13*14. 12*13 is 156, times 14. 156*14: 156*10 is 1560, plus 156*4=624, so total 1560+624=2184. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the product. So 12\u00d713\u00d714 equals 2184. So the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Their sum is 12+13+14 = 39. Hmm, but looking at the options, E is 39. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, the options are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39. So 39 would be E. But wait, let me confirm once again. 12\u00d713\u00d714: 12\u00d713 is 156, 156\u00d714: 156\u00d710=1560, 156\u00d74=624. 1560+624 is indeed 2184. So the three numbers are 12,13,14. Their sum is 12+13+14 = 39. So the answer should be E.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's another possibility. Maybe negative numbers? Let me see. Suppose the numbers are negative. Let's see, if the product is positive, then either all three are positive or one positive and two negative. But three consecutive integers with a product of 2184 (positive) could be three positives. Alternatively, maybe three negatives, but their product would be negative if there are an odd number of negatives, so three negatives would multiply to a negative number, which can't be 2184. So they must be positive. So the answer must be 39, E. So the correct option is E.\n",
