      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about M men who want to buy a gift that costs D rupees. If 3 men drop out, how much more does each have to contribute? Hmm, right. So I need to find the difference in the amount each person has to pay before and after the drop out.\n\nFirst, let me think about the initial contribution. Originally, each man was supposed to pay D divided by the number of men, which is M. So the original share per person is D/M.\n\nNow, if 3 men drop out, the number of men left is M minus 3. So the new number of contributors is (M - 3). Therefore, each remaining man now has to pay D divided by (M - 3). So the new contribution per person is D/(M -3).\n\nThe question is asking how much more each has to contribute. So I need to subtract the original amount from the new amount. That would be [D/(M -3) ] - [D/M]. The difference between these two is the extra amount each person has to pay now.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's calculate the difference:\n\nDifference = D/(M - 3) - D/M\n\nTo subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (M -3) and M, so the common denominator is M*(M -3). \n\nSo, rewriting both terms:\n\n= [D*M - D*(M -3)] / [M*(M -3)]\n\nExpanding the numerator:\n\nD*M - D*M + 3D. Wait, the D*M terms will cancel out. Let's see:\n\nNumerator: D*M - D*(M -3) = D*M - D*M +3D = 3D.\n\nSo the numerator is 3D, denominator is M*(M-3). So the difference is 3D / [M(M -3)].\n\nLooking at the options, option D is 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M). Wait, M squared minus 3M is the same as M(M -3). So that's exactly the denominator here. So the answer should be option D?\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Let me recheck the options given.\n\nOptions:\n\nA) D/(M-3)\n\nB) MD/3\n\nC) M/(D-3)\n\nD) 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M)\n\nE) None of these.\n\nHmm, so yes, the calculation gives 3D divided by M(M-3), which is the same as 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M). So that's option D. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The problem says \"how much more will each have to contribute\". So the calculation is correct, right?\n\nOriginal contribution per person: D/M.\n\nAfter 3 drop out, it's D/(M-3). The difference is (D/(M-3) - D/M) = 3D/(M(M-3)) which is the same as 3D/(M\u00b2 -3M). So yes, that's option D. \n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that I didn't make a mistake in the algebra. Let me recalculate the subtraction step again:\n\nD/(M-3) - D/M = D [1/(M-3) - 1/M] \n\n= D [ (M - (M-3)) / (M(M-3)) ]\n\nThe numerator inside the brackets is M - (M -3) = 3. So that gives 3D/(M(M-3)), which is exactly 3D over M squared minus 3M. So yes, correct. So the answer should be D.\n\nLooking at the options, option D is exactly that. So the correct answer is D. Therefore, the answer is D. \n\nBut wait, let me check if any of the options could be equivalent. Let me see:\n\nOption D is 3D/(M\u00b2 - 3M). Since M squared minus 3M factors into M(M-3), so that's correct. So I think that's the right answer. Therefore, the correct option is D.\n",
