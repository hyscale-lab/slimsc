      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a picket fence. Each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and there are 6 inches of space between each pair. I need to find the total length of the fence in feet, given there are x pickets. The options are given, so I have to figure out the right expression.\n\nHmm, first, I should think about how the total length is calculated. Each picket takes up some space, and the spaces between them take up the rest. Wait, but how many spaces are there? Like, if there are x pickets, the number of spaces between them would be one less than the number of pickets, right? Like, if there are two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, spaces would be (x-1) times 6 inches.\n\nSo the total length in inches would be the sum of all the picket widths plus all the spaces. Let me write that out:\n\nTotal length = (number of pickets \u00d7 width of each picket) + (number of spaces \u00d7 space width)\n\nPlugging in the numbers: each picket is 1/2 inch, so that's (x)*(1/2). The spaces between pickets are 6 inches each, and there's (x-1) of them. So spaces contribute 6*(x-1).\n\nSo total length in inches is (x/2) + 6(x-1). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst term: x/2 inches from the pickets.\n\nSecond term: 6(x-1) inches from the spaces.\n\nAdding them together: x/2 +6x -6. Let's combine like terms.\n\nx/2 +6x is the same as (1/2 +6)x. 6 is 12/2, so 1/2 +12/2 =13/2. So total is (13/2)x -6 inches.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the length in feet. Oh right, because the options are in fractions that might convert inches to feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I need to convert the total inches to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nSo total length in feet would be [(13/2)x -6] divided by 12. Let me write that as:\n\n[(13x/2 -6)] /12. To simplify this, maybe we can combine the terms over a common denominator. Let's see:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator appropriately. Let me think:\n\nAlternatively, let's split the division:\n\n(13x/2)/12 - 6/12. That would be (13x)/(24) - 0.5. Wait, but 6 divided by 12 is 0.5, so 6/12 is 1/2. Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them have that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should combine the terms first before dividing. Let's see:\n\nThe expression is ( (13x/2) -6 ) divided by 12. To combine terms, let's get a common denominator in the numerator. Let's express 6 as 12/2, so:\n\n13x/2 - 12/2 = (13x -12)/2. Then divide by 12:\n\n(13x -12)/2 divided by 12 is the same as (13x -12)/(2*12) = (13x-12)/24.\n\nOh, that gives option E: (13x -12)/24. Wait, so that's one of the options. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)13x/2 \u2192 that's in inches, probably not since the question says feet.\n\nB)13x/2 -6 \u2192 same, inches?\n\nC)13x/24 \u2192 maybe, but let's see.\n\nD)(13x+1)/24\n\nE)(13x-12)/24 \u2192 which matches what I got.\n\nWait, let me retrace steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nTotal length in inches:\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches, so x pickets contribute 0.5x inches.\n\nBetween each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches. Since there are x pickets, there are (x-1) spaces. So 6*(x-1).\n\nTotal inches: 0.5x +6(x-1) =0.5x +6x -6 =6.5x -6. 6.5 is 13/2, so 13x/2 -6. Then converting to feet by dividing by 12 gives (13x/2 -6)/12. \n\nYes, which when you factor that numerator as (13x -12)/2 (since 6 is 12/2), then dividing by 12 gives (13x-12)/24. So that's exactly option E. \n\nHmm, let me check the other options again. Let's see option C is 13x/24. If someone forgot to subtract the 6 inches, but that would be wrong. Option E is the right one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the conversion to feet? Let me check again. 1 foot is 12 inches, so dividing inches by 12 gives feet. So yes, that part's right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where the first picket doesn't have a space before it? But that's already considered because the number of spaces is x-1. So the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the length of the picket fence in feet. The problem says it's a straight fence made up of x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. And between each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches of space. Hmm, so I have to calculate the total length considering both the pickets and the spaces between them.\n\nFirst, let me think about how many spaces there are. If there are x pickets, then the number of spaces between them should be one less than the number of pickets, right? Like if there are two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, the spaces would be (x - 1) times 6 inches. \n\nSo the total length contributed by the pickets would be x multiplied by 1/2 inch each. And the spaces would be (x-1) multiplied by 6 inches. Adding those two together gives the total length in inches. Then I have to convert that into feet because the answer needs to be in feet. Oh right, since 12 inches equal a foot, I'll divide the total inches by 12.\n\nLet me write this out step by step. \n\nTotal picket width: x * (1/2) inches.\nTotal space width: (x - 1) * 6 inches.\nTotal length in inches: [ (x/2) + 6(x - 1) ] inches.\nThen convert to feet by dividing by 12.\n\nLet me compute the expression inside the brackets first. Let's combine those terms. Let me see:\n\nFirst, expand the space part: 6(x - 1) = 6x -6.\n\nSo total inches = (x/2) + 6x -6.\n\nHmm, combining like terms. Let me convert x/2 into a form that can be added to 6x. Let's see, 6x is the same as 12x/2. So x/2 + 12x/2 is (13x)/2. Then subtract the 6. So total inches would be (13x/2 -6) inches. \n\nWait, so that's the total in inches. To convert to feet, divide by 12. So the total length in feet is (13x/2 -6)/12. Let me write that as a fraction over 12. Alternatively, I can split it into two terms: (13x/2)/12 - 6/12. Which simplifies to (13x)/(24) - (1/2). Wait, but none of the options have that. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options: \n\nA)13x/2 \u2192 That's in inches, but the question says feet, so probably not.\n\nB)13x/2 -6 \u2192 Also inches, same problem.\n\nC)13x/24 \u2192 Hmm, maybe that's the right path but maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me go through again step by step. Let me check my math again.\n\nTotal length in inches:\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches, so x pickets: 0.5x inches.\n\nEach space is 6 inches, and there are (x-1) spaces. So total space is 6*(x-1).\n\nTotal inches = 0.5x +6(x-1). Let me compute that again.\n\n0.5x +6x -6 = (0.5x +6x) -6 = 6.5x -6. \n\nWait, 0.5x plus 6x is 6.5x, which is the same as 13/2 x. So 13x/2 -6. So that's correct. \n\nNow converting to feet, divide by 12. So (13x/2 -6)/12. Let's write this as a single fraction. \n\nMultiply numerator terms by 1/12: (13x/2)/12 - 6/12 = (13x)/(24) - (1/2). \n\nHmm, so the total length is (13x/24) minus 1/2. But none of the options have that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: 13x/24. So that's the first term but without the subtraction.\n\nOption D: (13x +1)/24. Hmm, maybe not. Option E: (13x-12)/24. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different way to combine terms. Let me try again:\n\nStarting from (13x/2 -6) inches divided by 12.\n\nLet me combine the terms over a common denominator. Let's see:\n\nThe numerator is (13x/2 -6) = (13x -12)/2. Because 6 is 12/2. So:\n\n(13x -12)/2 divided by 12 is (13x -12)/(24). \n\nAh! Oh right, that's better. Because 13x/2 minus 6 is the same as (13x - 12)/2. Then dividing by 12 gives (13x-12)/(24). \n\nSo that's (13x -12)/24, which is option E. \n\nWait, so why didn't I see that before? Let me confirm again:\n\nOriginal total inches: (13x/2 -6). \n\nExpress 6 as 12/2, so 13x/2 -12/2 = (13x -12)/2. \n\nDivide by 12 to get feet: [(13x -12)/2] /12 = (13x-12)/(24). \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer should be E. Let me check the options again. \n\nOption E is (13x -12)/24. That's exactly what we have. So that must be the correct answer. \n\nLet me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. \n\nAnother way to approach: Let's plug in a sample value for x. \n\nSuppose x is 1. Then there's 1 picket, which is 0.5 inches. Since there are no spaces between pickets (only one), so total length is 0.5 inches. Converting to feet: 0.5 /12 = 1/24 feet. \n\nLet's see what each option gives when x=1:\n\nOption E: (13*1 -12)/24 = (1)/24 \u2192 1/24. Which matches. \n\nOption C: 13/24, which is bigger. \n\nAnother test case: x=2. \n\nThen, two pickets each 0.5, so total picket length 1 inch. The space between them is 6 inches. Total inches: 1+6 =7. In feet: 7/12. \n\nOption E: (13*2 -12)/24 = (26-12)/24 =14/24 =7/12. Correct. \n\nAnother test: x=3. \n\nPickets: 3 *0.5 =1.5. Spaces: 2 *6 =12. Total inches 13.5. In feet: 13.5 /12 = 1.125. \n\nOption E: (39 -12)/24 =27/24= 1.125. Correct. \n\nSo yes, E is correct. So the answer is E.\n",

Total inches: 1+6 =7. In feet: 7/12. \n\nOption E: (13*2 -12)/24 = (26-12)/24 =14/24 =7/12. Correct. \n\nAnother test: x=3. \n\nPickets: 3 *0.5 =1.5. Spaces: 2 *6 =12. Total inches 13.5. In feet: 13.5 /12 = 1.125. \n\nOption E: (39 -12)/24 =27/24= 1.125. Correct. \n\nSo yes, E is correct. So the answer is E.\n\n\nTo determine the length of the fence in feet, we first calculate the total length in inches. Each picket is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch wide, so \\( x \\) pickets contribute \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\) inches. The spaces between the pickets are 6 inches each, and there are \\( x - 1 \\) spaces, contributing \\( 6(x - 1) \\) inches. \n\nAdding these contributions gives the total length in inches:\n\\[\n\\text{Total length (inches)} = \\frac{x}{2} + 6(x - 1)\n\\]\nExpanding and combining terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{x}{2} + 6x - 6 = \\frac{x}{2} + \\frac{12x}{2} - 6 = \\frac{13x}{2} - 6\n\\]\nTo convert this to feet, divide by 12 (since 1 foot = 12 inches):\n\\[\n\\text{Total length (feet)} = \\frac{\\frac{13x}{2} - 6}{12} = \\frac{13x - 12}{24}\n\\]\nThis matches option **E**. Testing with sample values of \\( x \\) (e.g., \\( x = 1, 2, 3 \\)) confirms the correctness of the derived formula.\n\nAnswer: E",
