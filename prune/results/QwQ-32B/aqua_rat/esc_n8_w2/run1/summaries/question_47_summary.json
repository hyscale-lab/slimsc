      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so there's this problem about two cars starting from opposite ends of a 50-mile highway. They're going different speeds, and I need to find out when they'll meet. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when two objects are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. Like, if one is going 10 mph and the other 20, together they're closing the distance at 30 mph. So maybe that's the case here. \n\nThe highway is 50 miles long. The cars start at opposite ends, so the total distance between them is 50 miles. The first car's speed is 12 mph, the second is 13 mph. So combined, their speed is 12 +13 = 25 mph. \n\nHmm, right. So the time it takes for them to meet should be the total distance divided by their combined speed. Because time = distance divided by speed. \n\nSo the formula would be time = total distance / (speed1 + speed2). Plugging in the numbers: 50 miles divided by (12 +13) mph. Let me calculate that. \n\n12 plus 13 is 25. 50 divided by 25 is 2. Wait, but that would be 2 hours? But let me check the options. Option E is 2. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's denote the time they take until meeting as t hours. In that time, the first car would have traveled 12t miles, and the second car 13t miles. Since they're moving towards each other, the sum of these distances should equal the total length of the highway when they meet. \n\nSo 12t +13t =50. Adding those gives 25t =50. Solving for t gives t=50/25=2. So that's 2 hours. So the answer would be E) 2? But wait, the options include 1.5 and others. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The highway is 50 miles long. They start from opposite ends. The speeds are 12 and 13. So yes, the combined speed is 25 mph, so 50/25 is indeed 2 hours. Hmm. Then why are there other options? Let me see the options again: A is 1, B 1.25, C 1.5, D 1.75, E 2. So E is there, so that must be correct. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me try another way. Suppose after time t, the distance covered by first car is 12t, the second is 13t. Since they started from opposite ends, the total distance covered when they meet should be exactly 50 miles. So 12t +13t =50. Yep, that's exactly what I did before. So the answer should be 2. \n\nHmm. So why would the options include lower numbers? Maybe I made a mistake in units? Let's see. The speed is in mph, time is in hours, distance in miles. So units are consistent. 50 miles divided by 25 mph gives 2 hours. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Like, maybe the highway is 50 miles long but they start at the ends and meet somewhere in between. But no, that's exactly what the problem states. \n\nWait, maybe the question is in minutes? But the options are in decimal numbers. For example, 1.5 would be 1 hour 30 minutes, so that's 1.5 hours. The options are all in hours, I think. \n\nHmm. Unless I miscalculated. Let me check again: 12 +13 is 25. 50 divided by 25 is 2. So yeah, that's correct. So the answer must be E) 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a typo? Like maybe the highway is 45 miles? But according to the problem, it's 50. \n\nHmm. So I think the correct answer is E) 2. Let me check the options again. The options are A)1, B)1.25, C)1.50, D)1.75, E)2. So E is there. I think that's the right choice. I don't see any error in my reasoning here. So I'll go with E.\n",

Hmm, let me think.\n\nAlright, first, since they're starting from opposite ends, their distances from the starting points will add up as they move towards each other. Wait, actually, when they meet, the sum of the distances they've covered should equal the total length of the highway, right? That makes sense because together they cover the entire 50 miles between them.\n\nSo let me denote the time taken until they meet as 't' hours. Then, the distance the first car covers is 12t miles, and the second car covers 13t miles. Adding those two should give 50 miles. So the equation would be 12t + 13t = 50. \n\nAdding those together, 12 +13 is 25. So 25t =50. Then solving for t, divide both sides by 25. That gives t=50/25=2. Wait, that would be 2 hours? But let me check the options. Option E is 2, so that's possible. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me re-read the problem. The highway is 50 miles long.

Wait, maybe I made an error in adding the speeds?\n\nWait no, when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So that part is right. So 25 mph.
