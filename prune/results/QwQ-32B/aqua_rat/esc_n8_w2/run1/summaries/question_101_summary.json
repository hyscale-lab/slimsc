      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this ratio problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about red and green sweets in a bag, with a ratio of 3 to 4. And they tell me there are 120 green sweets, and I need to find how many red ones there are. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but let's take it slow.\n\nFirst, ratios compare quantities. So the ratio of red to green is 3:4. That means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. But how does that translate to actual numbers? Well, maybe I can set up a proportion here. Like, if 3 parts are red and 4 parts are green, then the total parts would be 3 + 4 = 7, but maybe I don't need the total. Wait, the problem gives me the actual number of green sweets, so maybe I can find out how much each \"part\" is worth.\n\nLet me think. The ratio is red:green = 3:4. So the number of red sweets divided by the number of green sweets should equal 3/4. So, if I let R be the number of red sweets, then R / 120 = 3/4. Because the green sweets are 120. So solving for R would be (3/4)*120. Let me compute that. 120 divided by 4 is 30, then multiplied by 3 is 90. So that would be 90 red sweets. Hmm, option A is 90. But wait, let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of parts. The ratio 3:4 means that the total parts are 7. But since green is 4 parts and that's equal to 120, each part must be 120 divided by 4. So each part is 30. Then red is 3 parts, so 3 times 30 is 90. Yeah, that gives the same answer. So that would be A)90. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. The ratio is red to green, so 3:4. So red is 3 parts, green is 4 parts. Since green is 120, each part is 30. So red is 3*30=90. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought the ratio was green to red, they might get a different answer. But the question says red to green is 3:4, so that's correct. Let me check the options again. Option A is 90. So that's the answer, right? Hmm. Yeah, I think that's correct. I can't see any mistake here. So the answer should be A.\n",

Like, maybe if there were 3 red and 4 green, that's the simplest form. But here, the actual number of green is 120. I need to figure out the number of red that keeps the same ratio.\n\nI remember that ratios can be thought of as fractions. So the ratio red/green = 3/4. So if I let R be the number of red sweets, then R divided by 120 should equal 3/4. Wait, let me write that down properly. \n\nSo, R / 120 = 3 /4. To solve for R, I can cross-multiply. That would give R = (3/4)*120. Let me calculate that. 3 times 120 is 360, divided by 4. 360 divided by 4 is... 90. Oh, so R is 90.

But maybe that's not needed here because the question gives the actual count of green. Let me check again. \n\nWait, another approach. The ratio of red to green is 3:4. So for every 4 green sweets, there are 3 red. Since there are 120 green, how many groups of 4 are there in 120? 120 divided by 4 is 30. So each group has 3 red, so total red is 3 times 30, which is 90. Yep, same answer. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be 90, which is option A. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. The ratio is red to green, so 3:4. So red is less than green. Since green is 120, red should be less. 90 is less than 120, which makes sense. If I had gotten 160, that would be more and wrong. So yes, 90 is correct. The options have A as 90, so that must be the right choice.\n",
