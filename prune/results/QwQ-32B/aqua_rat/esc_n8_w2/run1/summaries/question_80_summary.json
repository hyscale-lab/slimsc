      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about Boomtown's population growth. Let me try to parse it out step by step. The question is about figuring out the percentage increase in population over the last year, given some projections for the next two years and a relationship to the population from a year ago. Hmm, okay.\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem. The planners expect a 10% annual increase for the next two years. If that happens, the population in two years will be double what it was a year ago. I need to find the closest percentage increase from last year to now. \n\nLet me think of variables. Let's denote the population one year ago as P. Then, the current population would be something, right? Because the question is about the increase over the last year. Wait, the problem is asking for the percentage increase from last year to now. So the current population is last year's population plus the increase. Let me set up some variables properly.\n\nLet me define:\nLet\u2019s say the population one year ago was P. Let\u2019s denote the current population (now) as C. The question is asking for the percentage increase from last year (so from P to C). So the increase would be (C - P)/P * 100%.\n\nNow, the projection is that next year, the population will increase by 10%, so next year's population would be C * 1.10. Then, the following year (two years from now), it would be that amount times 1.10 again. So two years from now, the population would be C*(1.1)^2.\n\nThe problem states that this two-year-from-now population is exactly double the population from one year ago. So, according to the problem, C*(1.1)^2 = 2*P.\n\nSo the equation is: C*(1.1)^2 = 2P.\n\nWe can rearrange this to solve for C in terms of P. Let's see:\n\nC = (2P)/(1.1)^2.\n\nLet me compute 1.1 squared. 1.1 * 1.1 is 1.21. So, 2 divided by 1.21 is approximately... Let me calculate that. 2 divided by 1.21. Hmm, 1.21 times 1.65 is roughly 2? Let me check. 1.21*1.6=1.936. 1.21*1.65 would be 1.21*(1.6 +0.05) = 1.936 +0.0605=1.9965. Close to 2. So 1.65 is approximately 2/1.21. So 2/1.21 \u2248 1.65289...\n\nSo, C = (2 / 1.21) * P \u2248 1.65289 * P.\n\nTherefore, the current population is approximately 1.65289 times the population from a year ago. So the increase from last year to now is (C - P)/P = (1.65289P - P)/P = 0.65289, which is 65.289%.\n\nLooking at the options, that's closest to 65%, which is option D. But wait, let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the percentage increase over the last year. So that's exactly what I calculated. The population went from P to C, which is 1.65289 times P. So that's a 65.289% increase. The options given are D)65% and E)75%. 65.289 is much closer to 65% than to 75%, so D is the answer.\n\nHmm, let me confirm the steps again. Let me go through the equation again. Let me re-derive the equation to make sure I didn't flip anything.\n\nSo, the population two years from now is (current population)*1.1*1.1 = current *1.21. That's equal to twice the population of one year ago. So current *1.21 = 2 * P. Therefore, current = 2P / 1.21. \n\nYes, so current is (2/1.21)P. 2 divided by 1.21 is approximately 1.6529. So the increase from P to current is (1.6529 -1) = 0.6529, so 65.29% increase. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore the answer is D)65%.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the percentage population increase over the last year in Boomtown. The problem says that the population is expected to increase by 10% each year for the next two years. And if that happens, the population in two years will be exactly double what it was one year ago. Hmm, I need to relate these percentages somehow.\n\nLet me start by assigning variables. Let's let P be the current population. Wait, but actually, maybe I should consider the population from different time points. Let me think. The problem mentions the population two years from now and one year ago. So maybe I should set up variables for each time point.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s say the population one year ago was X. Then, the current population (now) would be X plus the increase from last year. Wait, but we don't know the increase from last year yet. That's actually what we need to find. The question is asking for the percent increase over the last year, so the increase from one year ago to now. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should let the current population be the starting point. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me define:\n\nLet current population be P.\n\nThen, after one year, it will be P * 1.10 (since it's a 10% increase). After the second year, it will be 1.10 * (P *1.10) = P*(1.1)^2. So two years from now, the population is P*(1.21).\n\nThe problem states that this two-year future population is exactly double the population of one year ago. The population one year ago would be the population before the current year. Let me see: if the current population is P, then last year's population (one year ago) would be P divided by (1 + the growth rate from last year). Wait, but we don't know the growth rate from last year. Wait, the question is asking for the percentage increase over the last year. Let me think of that as the variable.\n\nLet me denote the population one year ago as Q. Then, the current population P is Q multiplied by (1 + r), where r is the growth rate (as a decimal) from last year to now. So P = Q*(1 + r). We need to find r, then convert that to a percentage.\n\nThe population two years from now is P*(1.1)^2, as before. According to the problem, that equals 2 times Q (since it's double the population one year ago). So:\n\nP*(1.1)^2 = 2Q.\n\nBut since P = Q*(1 + r), substitute that into the equation:\n\nQ*(1 + r) * (1.21) = 2Q.\n\nDivide both sides by Q to cancel it out:\n\n(1 + r) * 1.21 = 2.\n\nThen, solving for (1 + r):\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21.\n\nCalculating that, 2 divided by 1.21. Let me compute that. 1.21 times 1.65 is about 2? Let's see:\n\n1.21 * 1.65: 1.21 * 1.6 = 1.936, plus 1.21 *0.05 = 0.0605. Total 1.9965, which is close to 2. Hmm, so maybe 2/1.21 is approximately 1.65289...\n\nSo 1 + r \u2248 1.65289, so r \u2248 0.65289, which is approximately 65.289%. So the closest answer would be D)65%? Let me check my steps again to make sure.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculation again. 2 divided by 1.21:\n\n1.21 \u00d7 1.65289 = ?\n\nWell, 1.21 \u00d7 1.65289. Let me compute 2 divided by 1.21 exactly:\n\n2 / 1.21 = 200 / 121 \u2248 1.65289256... So yes, exactly. So r is approximately 65.28%, so the closest option is D (65%). The options given are A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%. So D is the closest. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I set up the equations correctly. The key part is that two years from now's population is double the population from one year ago. So the future population (two years from now) is 2 times the population one year ago. \n\nSo yes, the equations are correct. The current population is P = Q*(1 + r). Then, after two years, it's P*(1.1)^2 = Q*(1 + r)*(1.21) = 2Q. So solving for (1 + r) gives 2/1.21, so r is 2/(1.21) -1. Which is exactly 0.65289... So 65.28%. Therefore, the answer is D.\n",
