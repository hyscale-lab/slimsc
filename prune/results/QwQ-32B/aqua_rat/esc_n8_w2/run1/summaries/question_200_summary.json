      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about three friends who answer a question on an exam, each with different probabilities of getting it right. The question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. Hmm, so I need to figure out the scenarios where the correct answer is achieved without cheating, and then calculate that probability.\n\nFirst, let me parse the details again. Alan is guessing randomly, so his chance is 1/5. Roger is cheating by looking at someone else's paper, so his probability is 2/3. Peter is doing the calculations properly, so his probability is 5/6. The key here is that cheating is only mentioned for Roger, right? So the \"not via cheating\" part probably means that we should exclude any scenario where Roger is the one who got it right through cheating. Wait, or does it mean that the correct answer is achieved without any cheating? Because if the question is answered correctly by any of them, but we have to ensure that the method wasn't cheating. So the correct answer must come from Alan's guess or Peter's correct calculation, but not from Roger's cheating.\n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So maybe it's the probability that at least one of them answered correctly, but none of them cheated? Or does it mean that the correct answer was achieved without cheating? Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that person didn't cheat, or that the correct answer came from non-cheating methods?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one of them, and that none of them cheated. But that might not be the case. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"What is the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating?\" So the correct answer must be achieved, but not through cheating. So the cheating here is specifically Roger's method. So the correct answer could be from Alan or Peter, but not from Roger. Wait, but maybe the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, but the method wasn't cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, so the non-cheating methods are Alan and Peter. Therefore, the event we want is that either Alan or Peter (or both) answered correctly, but Roger did not cheat (i.e., he got it wrong?), or maybe that the correct answer was achieved through Alan or Peter's methods, not Roger's?\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is phrased as the answer being correct, but not obtained through cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, then the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. But how do we model this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct and that the correct answer was not obtained via cheating. So, if the correct answer is due to Alan (since he guessed, which is not cheating) or Peter (since he calculated properly, which is not cheating), then that's acceptable. But if Roger is the one who got it right via cheating, then that's excluded. Wait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So perhaps it's the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly, but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. Wait, but how do we know which method each used? Or maybe it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved through non-cheating methods, regardless of others? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simply that the answer is correct, and the method used was not cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, so the correct answer must come from Alan or Peter. Therefore, we need the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but Roger is not the one who contributed the correct answer. Wait, maybe the problem is that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that person was either Alan or Peter? Or is it that the answer was correct, but the cheating method (Roger's) didn't contribute to it?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one of the three, but without any cheating having occurred. That would mean that Roger didn't cheat (so he must have answered incorrectly?), and either Alan or Peter (or both) answered correctly. Because if Roger cheated, then even if he got it right, that's considered \"via cheating\" so we have to exclude that scenario. Wait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So perhaps the correct answer must be achieved through non-cheating methods, so Roger's cheating is excluded. So the only ways are Alan's correct guess or Peter's correct calculation, but not involving Roger's cheating. So the event is that the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, and Roger did not cheat (i.e., he didn't contribute the correct answer). Wait, maybe I need to think of all possible scenarios where the answer is correct, but the correct answer was not due to cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, then the correct answer could be from Alan (his guess) or Peter (his correct work), but not from Roger's cheating. So the total probability would be the probability that either Alan is correct or Peter is correct, but Roger is incorrect, plus the cases where both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is incorrect? Wait, no. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me structure the problem.\n\nThe question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method (he looked at someone else's paper), then the correct answer must be achieved through non-cheating methods. So, the correct answer can be from Alan (who's guessing, but that's not cheating) or Peter (who's calculating properly). However, if Roger also got it right via cheating, does that affect the outcome? Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, and that it was not obtained via cheating. So, the correct answer must be from either Alan or Peter's correct methods, but not from Roger's cheating. However, if all three answered correctly, but Roger did so by cheating, then that scenario would be excluded. So the total probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect, or maybe even if Roger is correct but he didn't cheat? Wait, but Roger's method is cheating, so if he answers correctly, that's via cheating. So any scenario where Roger's answer is correct would count as cheating, so those scenarios should be excluded.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. So, the correct answer must be from Alan (his guess) or Peter (his calculations), but not from Roger's cheating. So the event is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then even if Alan or Peter are also correct, the presence of Roger's cheating (since he used cheating to get it right) would make the answer's correctness via cheating, so we have to exclude that. Alternatively, perhaps the question wants the probability that the answer is correct and that the person who answered correctly didn't cheat. But since there are three friends, maybe the question is referring to the answer being correct, but none of them cheated. Wait, but the question says \"not via cheating\"\u2014maybe it's the answer was correct, but the method wasn't cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, so the answer being correct via non-cheating would require that either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't cheat (i.e., he didn't contribute the correct answer via cheating). So perhaps the scenarios are:\n\nEither:\n\n- Alan is correct and Peter is correct, Roger is wrong. (Both non-cheaters correct, Roger wrong)\n\nOR\n\n- Alan correct, Peter wrong, Roger wrong.\n\nOR\n\n- Alan wrong, Peter correct, Roger wrong.\n\nSo in all cases, Roger must be wrong, and at least one of Alan or Peter is correct.\n\nBecause if Roger is correct, even if others are correct too, then the answer's correctness includes cheating, so that scenario is excluded.\n\nSo the probability would be the probability that Roger is wrong, multiplied by the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, given that Roger is wrong. Wait, no, not conditional. Since the events are independent, right?\n\nWait, the three friends are attempting the question independently? The problem says \"Three friends Alan, Roger and Peter attempt to answer a question on an exam.\" So I think their attempts are independent. So their probabilities are independent.\n\nTherefore, the total probability would be the probability that the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, but not via cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, so the cheating scenario is when Roger answers correctly. So the correct answer can come from Alan or Peter, but not via Roger. Wait, but how do we model that?\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is considered to be \"not via cheating\" if at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan or Peter) got it right, and Roger did not get it right via cheating. Because if Roger got it right, that's cheating, so the scenario where the answer is correct but not via cheating would require that the correct answer was from Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't contribute (i.e., he was wrong).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased such that the \"correct answer\" is obtained without any cheating, so all three must have answered correctly without cheating. Wait, no. The wording is a bit ambiguous, but I think the best way is to think that the answer is correct, but the correctness wasn't achieved through cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, so the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and Roger must have not gotten it right (since if he did, that would be via cheating). So the event is:\n\nCorrect answer (i.e., at least one of them got it right) AND not (Roger got it right via cheating). Wait, but how to model that?\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is obtained by at least one of the three, but the method used wasn't cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, so if the correct answer comes from Roger, that's cheating. So the desired probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was via cheating, so that's excluded. Alternatively, even if others are correct, but Roger is also correct, then the presence of Roger's cheating would make the entire correct answer \"via cheating\". So the only valid scenarios are those where at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is P( (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect ).\n\nSince the events are independent, we can compute this as:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, since all three are independent, the events are independent. So the probability that Alan or Peter are correct and Roger is incorrect is equal to [P(A correct) + P(P correct) - P(A and P correct)] multiplied by P(R incorrect). Wait, no, actually, the formula is:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P | \u00acR ) * P(\u00acR )\n\nBut since the events are independent, the occurrence of Roger's answer doesn't affect Alan or Peter's. So:\n\nAlternatively, the joint probability is:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) occurs AND R is incorrect.\n\nWhich can be calculated as:\n\n[1 - P(A' and P')] * P(R') \n\nBecause the probability that at least one of A or P is correct is 1 minus the probability both are wrong. Then multiply by the probability that R is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the probability that Roger is incorrect. Roger's probability of being correct is 2/3, so incorrect is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nNow, the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, given that Roger is incorrect. But since they are independent, the \"given that\" part doesn't affect their probabilities. So the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct is:\n\n1 - P(Alan wrong AND Peter wrong) \n\nAlan's wrong probability is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.\n\nPeter's wrong is 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.\n\nSo P(both wrong) = (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15.\n\nThus, the probability that at least one is correct is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nTherefore, the total probability would be 13/15 (probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct) multiplied by the probability that Roger is wrong (1/3). \n\nWait, that would be (13/15)*(1/3) = 13/45. Hmm, but 13/45 is one of the options, option E. But let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nSo 13/45 is E. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the question is answered correctly, so the total probability of correct answer not via cheating is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect, plus the cases where even if Roger is correct but someone else is also correct? Wait, no. Because if Roger is correct (via cheating), then the correctness is via cheating, so that scenario is excluded. So the only valid scenarios are when Roger is incorrect and at least one of the other two is correct. That's exactly what I calculated before. So that's (13/15)*(1/3) = 13/45, which is option E. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to consider all possible scenarios where the answer is correct but not via cheating. The only way cheating could be involved is if Roger is correct. So the correct answer without cheating is when the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter (or both) and Roger is incorrect. So yes, that's exactly the scenario we need.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted as the answer being correct, and the correct answer was not obtained through cheating by any of them. But since only Roger can cheat, then as long as Roger is not correct, then the correct answer (if any) is from Alan or Peter. So the probability that the answer is correct (i.e., at least one of them is correct) AND Roger is incorrect. So that would be:\n\nP(at least one correct among all three) but with Roger incorrect. Wait, no. Because the \"correct answer\" would be the question being answered correctly by someone, but the method wasn't cheating. So the \"correct answer\" is the fact that someone got it right, but the method (i.e., the person's method) wasn't cheating. So the scenario where the answer is correct but not via cheating would require that at least one non-cheater (Alan or Peter) got it right, and Roger didn't (since if Roger got it right, that's cheating). \n\nTherefore, the required probability is the probability that (Alan or Peter is correct) AND Roger is incorrect. \n\nYes, that's exactly the same as before. So:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) when R is incorrect. Since the three are independent, the events of A and P are independent of R. So the probability that R is incorrect is 1/3. The probability that A or P is correct is 1 - P(not A and not P) = 1 - (4/5 * 1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 = 13/15. \n\nMultiplying them: (13/15)*(1/3) = 13/(15*3) = 13/45. So that's option E. Hmm, but let me check if there's another way someone might think, perhaps including cases where Roger is correct but others are also correct. Wait, but in that case, the answer's correctness includes Roger's cheating, so even if others are correct, the presence of Roger's correct answer via cheating would mean that the correctness was via cheating. So those scenarios must be excluded. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted as the answer being correct, and none of them cheated. But cheating is only done by Roger. So \"none cheated\" would mean that Roger did not cheat, but that might not be the right interpretation. Since Roger's cheating is part of his method, so if he uses that method and gets it right, then cheating occurred. So the scenario where Roger didn't cheat would be if he didn't look at the paper, but the problem says he does cheat. Wait, the problem states that \"Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly.\" So his method is cheating, so whenever he answers, it's via cheating. So the only way for the answer to not be via cheating is if Roger is incorrect and at least one of the others is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be E)13/45. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options include 23/90, which is C. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate:\n\nProbability that Roger is incorrect: 1/3.\n\nProbability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct:\n\nAlan's correct: 1/5, incorrect: 4/5.\n\nPeter's correct:5/6, incorrect:1/6.\n\nSo the probability both incorrect is (4/5)*(1/6) = (4/30) = 2/15.\n\nThus, the probability that at least one is correct is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nMultiply by 1/3: (13/15)*(1/3) = 13/45. \n\nYes, that's correct. So E is the right answer. But let me see why someone might think of another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly and that one is either Alan or Peter. But that's not the case because the question says \"answered correctly\"\u2014so it's at least one, but not via cheating. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\" means that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one was not cheating. For example, if only Alan is correct, that's acceptable. If only Peter is correct, that's okay. If both Alan and Peter are correct, that's okay. But if Roger is correct alone or with others, that's not. \n\nBut the way the question is phrased, it's the probability that the question was answered correctly (so at least one is correct) and that the method wasn't cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, the only way the answer is correct and not via cheating is when Roger is wrong and at least one of the others is correct. So that's exactly the same as my calculation. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is E)13/45. \n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Suppose all three attempt the question, and the question is considered to be answered correctly if at least one of them is correct. But the \"not via cheating\" part requires that the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, the cheating contribution is only if Roger got it right. So the total correct answers not via cheating are the cases where the correct answers come from Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, but the correct answer wasn't obtained by cheating. So, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have gotten it right. So the scenarios where at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is wrong. Which again is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E)13/45.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating, we need to consider scenarios where the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter (non-cheating methods) and exclude any contributions from Roger (who cheats). \n\n1. **Roger's incorrect probability**: Since Roger cheats with a 2/3 chance of being correct, his chance of being incorrect is \\(1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct**:\n   - Alan's incorrect probability: \\(1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}\\).\n   - Peter's incorrect probability: \\(1 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n   - Both incorrect: \\(\\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15}\\).\n   - At least one correct: \\(1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}\\).\n\n3. **Combine the probabilities**:\n   - The total probability is the product of Roger being incorrect and at least one of Alan or Peter being correct:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{13}{15}\\right) = \\frac{13}{45}.\n     \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is \\(\\frac{13}{45}\\).\n\nAnswer: E",

So the desired probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was via cheating, so that's excluded. Alternatively, even if others are correct, but Roger is also correct, then the presence of Roger's cheating would make the entire correct answer \"via cheating\". So the only valid scenarios are those where at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the probability is P( (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect ).\n\nSince the events are independent, we can compute this as:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, since all three are independent, the events are independent. So the probability that Alan or Peter are correct and Roger is incorrect is equal to [P(A correct) + P(P correct) - P(A and P correct)] multiplied by P(R incorrect). Wait, no, actually, the formula is:\n\nP( (A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR ) = P(A \u2228 P | \u00acR ) * P(\u00acR )\n\nBut since the events are independent, the occurrence of Roger's answer doesn't affect Alan or Peter's. So:\n\nAlternatively, the joint probability is:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) occurs AND R is incorrect.\n\nWhich can be calculated as:\n\n[1 - P(A' and P')] * P(R') \n\nBecause the probability that at least one of A or P is correct is 1 minus the probability both are wrong. Then multiply by the probability that R is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute it step by step.\n\nFirst, compute the probability that Roger is incorrect. Roger's probability of being correct is 2/3, so incorrect is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3.\n\nNow, the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, given that Roger is incorrect. But since they are independent, the \"given that\" part doesn't affect their probabilities. So the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct is:\n\n1 - P(Alan wrong AND Peter wrong) \n\nAlan's wrong probability is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5.\n\nPeter's wrong is 1 - 5/6 = 1/6.\n\nSo P(both wrong) = (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15.\n\nThus, the probability that at least one is correct is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nTherefore, the total probability would be 13/15 (probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct) multiplied by the probability that Roger is wrong (1/3). \n\nWait, that would be (13/15)*(1/3) = 13/45. Hmm, but 13/45 is one of the options, option E. But let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nSo 13/45 is E. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the question is answered correctly, so the total probability of correct answer not via cheating is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct and Roger is incorrect, plus the cases where even if Roger is correct but someone else is also correct? Wait, no. Because if Roger is correct (via cheating), then the correctness is via cheating, so that scenario is excluded. So the only valid scenarios are when Roger is incorrect and at least one of the other two is correct. That's exactly what I calculated before. So that's (13/15)*(1/3) = 13/45, which is option E. Hmm.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way to approach this is to consider all possible scenarios where the answer is correct but not via cheating. The only way cheating could be involved is if Roger is correct. So the correct answer without cheating is when the correct answer is achieved by Alan or Peter (or both) and Roger is incorrect. So yes, that's exactly the scenario we need.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted as the answer being correct, and the correct answer was not obtained through cheating by any of them. But since only Roger can cheat, then as long as Roger is not correct, then the correct answer (if any) is from Alan or Peter. So the probability that the answer is correct (i.e., at least one of them is correct) AND Roger is incorrect. So that would be:\n\nP(at least one correct among all three) but with Roger incorrect. Wait, no. Because the \"correct answer\" would be the question being answered correctly by someone, but the method wasn't cheating. So the \"correct answer\" is the fact that someone got it right, but the method (i.e., the person's method) wasn't cheating. So the scenario where the answer is correct but not via cheating would require that at least one non-cheater (Alan or Peter) got it right, and Roger didn't (since if Roger got it right, that's cheating). \n\nTherefore, the required probability is the probability that (Alan or Peter is correct) AND Roger is incorrect. \n\nYes, that's exactly the same as before. So:\n\nP(A \u2228 P) when R is incorrect. Since the three are independent, the events of A and P are independent of R. So the probability that R is incorrect is 1/3. The probability that A or P is correct is 1 - P(not A and not P) = 1 - (4/5 * 1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 = 13/15. \n\nMultiplying them: (13/15)*(1/3) = 13/(15*3) = 13/45. So that's option E. Hmm, but let me check if there's another way someone might think, perhaps including cases where Roger is correct but others are also correct. Wait, but in that case, the answer's correctness includes Roger's cheating, so even if others are correct, the presence of Roger's correct answer via cheating would mean that the correctness was via cheating. So those scenarios must be excluded. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted as the answer being correct, and none of them cheated. But cheating is only done by Roger. So \"none cheated\" would mean that Roger did not cheat, but that might not be the right interpretation. Since Roger's cheating is part of his method, so if he uses that method and gets it right, then cheating occurred. So the scenario where Roger didn't cheat would be if he didn't look at the paper, but the problem says he does cheat. Wait, the problem states that \"Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly.\" So his method is cheating, so whenever he answers, it's via cheating. So the only way for the answer to not be via cheating is if Roger is incorrect and at least one of the others is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. So the answer should be E)13/45. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options include 23/90, which is C. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate:\n\nProbability that Roger is incorrect: 1/3.\n\nProbability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct:\n\nAlan's correct: 1/5, incorrect: 4/5.\n\nPeter's correct:5/6, incorrect:1/6.\n\nSo the probability both incorrect is (4/5)*(1/6) = (4/30) = 2/15.\n\nThus, the probability that at least one is correct is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nMultiply by 1/3: (13/15)*(1/3) = 13/45. \n\nYes, that's correct. So E is the right answer. But let me see why someone might think of another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly and that one is either Alan or Peter. But that's not the case because the question says \"answered correctly\"\u2014so it's at least one, but not via cheating. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the question. Maybe \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\" means that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one was not cheating. For example, if only Alan is correct, that's acceptable. If only Peter is correct, that's okay. If both Alan and Peter are correct, that's okay. But if Roger is correct alone or with others, that's not. \n\nBut the way the question is phrased, it's the probability that the question was answered correctly (so at least one is correct) and that the method wasn't cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, the only way the answer is correct and not via cheating is when Roger is wrong and at least one of the others is correct. So that's exactly the same as my calculation. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is E)13/45. \n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Suppose all three attempt the question, and the question is considered to be answered correctly if at least one of them is correct. But the \"not via cheating\" part requires that the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, the cheating contribution is only if Roger got it right. So the total correct answers not via cheating are the cases where the correct answers come from Alan or Peter, and Roger is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, but the correct answer wasn't obtained by cheating. So, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have gotten it right. So the scenarios where at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is wrong. Which again is the same as before.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E)13/45.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating, we need to consider scenarios where the correct answer comes from Alan or Peter (non-cheating methods) and exclude any contributions from Roger (who cheats). \n\n1. **Roger's incorrect probability**: Since Roger cheats with a 2/3 chance of being correct, his chance of being incorrect is \\(1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct**:\n   - Alan's incorrect probability: \\(1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}\\).\n   - Peter's incorrect probability: \\(1 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).\n   - Both incorrect: \\(\\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15}\\).\n   - At least one correct: \\(1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}\\).\n\n3. **Combine the probabilities**:\n   - The total probability is the product of Roger being incorrect and at least one of Alan or Peter being correct:\n     \\[\n     \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\times \\left(\\frac{13}{15}\\right) = \\frac{13}{45}.\n     \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is \\(\\frac{13}{45}\\).\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about calculating the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. The three friends are Alan, Roger, and Peter. Each has different probabilities of getting the question right. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand each person's scenario:\n\n- Alan is guessing randomly, so his chance of a correct answer is 1/5. Since he's guessing, I assume that's considered not cheating. Right, because the problem states that Alan \"randomly guesses,\" so that's fair play. \n\n- Roger is cheating by looking at someone else's paper. His probability of answering correctly is 2/3. Since he's cheating, any correct answer from him would count as cheating, so we need to exclude his correct answers from the desired probability.\n\n- Peter is doing the calculations properly, so his correct answer is legitimate. His probability is 5/6, so that's definitely part of the desired outcome.\n\nThe question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answers here would be from Alan or Peter, but not Roger. Wait, but the way the question is phrased might be a bit tricky. Are we considering the scenario where at least one of them answers correctly without cheating, or is it the probability that exactly one of them answers correctly without cheating?\n\nHmm, no, maybe I need to think of it as the probability that at least one of the non-cheating methods (Alan or Peter) got it right, but Roger didn't. Wait, or perhaps it's the probability that the answer is correct, and that correct answer wasn't due to cheating. So, the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter, not Roger. But how does that work if more than one person answered correctly?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased as the probability that the question is answered correctly (by at least one of them?), but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. Wait, maybe I need to read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says, \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So, perhaps the event is that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that person was not cheating. Or maybe the question is answered correctly by at least one non-cheater, while the cheater (Roger) did not get it right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly, but none of the correct answers were obtained through cheating. Wait, but since Roger is the only cheater, so that would mean that Roger must have answered incorrectly, and at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly. \n\nAh, that's probably the right interpretation. Because the question is about the probability that the question was answered correctly, but not via cheating. So, the correct answer(s) must have come from the non-cheaters (Alan and Peter), and Roger's answer, if correct, would have been cheating. So, the scenario is: at least one of Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger did not get it right (since if Roger did get it right, then the correct answer could have been via cheating, so we have to exclude any cases where Roger was correct). Wait, but the question says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating.\" So maybe the correct answer must not have been obtained through cheating. So, the only way that can happen is if at least one of Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Because if Roger got it right, then that correct answer was via cheating, so even if another person got it right, the presence of Roger's correct answer would mean that the correct answer was achieved via cheating. Or perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone, and that the method used was not cheating. \n\nHmm, perhaps another way: The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly, and that the answer was not obtained through cheating. Since the answer must be correct, but the method must not involve cheating. So, the correct answer must come from either Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have cheated (but actually, Roger's cheating is part of his method; so his method is cheating, so any correct answer from Roger would be via cheating. So, to have the correct answer not via cheating, the correct answer must come from Alan or Peter, and Roger must have not gotten it right (because if he did, even if someone else did too, then the presence of Roger's correct answer via cheating would mean that the answer was obtained via cheating). Wait, but maybe the question is considering that the answer is considered correct, but the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So, the correct answer must have been achieved by non-cheating methods, so even if Roger also got it right, but the correct answer could have been via cheating. So maybe the question wants the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, which would require that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Because if Roger got it right, then the correct answer could have come from him (cheating), so the answer might not qualify as \"not via cheating\".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the question is answered correctly by at least one person, but none of the correct answers were obtained through cheating. So, in other words, the correct answers (if any) must come from Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer must be incorrect. Because if Roger's answer is correct, even if others are correct, the fact that Roger cheated means that the correct answer was obtained via cheating. Therefore, the desired probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, to compute that, we can calculate the probability that Roger is incorrect (so 1 - 2/3 = 1/3), multiplied by the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct.\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nThe total desired probability is P(Roger is incorrect) * [1 - P(Alan incorrect AND Peter incorrect)]. Because for at least one of Alan or Peter to be correct, it's the complement of both being incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the formula would be:\n\nP(Roger incorrect) * [1 - P(Alan wrong) * P(Peter wrong)]\n\nBecause the events of Alan and Peter's answers are independent, right? So the probability that both Alan and Peter are wrong is (1 - 1/5)*(1 -5/6) = (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. Therefore, the probability that at least one of them is correct is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nSo then, the overall probability would be (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45? Wait, but 13/45 is one of the options (option E). Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one was not cheating. But that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem states \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". The wording might mean that the correct answer was achieved without any cheating. So, the scenario where the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer did not come from cheating. Since Roger's method is cheating, so the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, but also, Roger's answer must not have been correct (since if he got it right, then the correct answer could have been via cheating). Therefore, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and Roger must have not gotten it right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even if Roger got it right, but someone else also did without cheating, then the correct answer is via cheating? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous here. The problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So perhaps the entire correct answer must not have been obtained through cheating, so any correct answer from Roger would disqualify it. Therefore, the scenario is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of the three answered correctly, and that one was not cheating. But that would be different. For example, if both Alan and Peter got it right, then that's still acceptable. So perhaps the correct approach is as I first thought: the probability that the question was answered correctly (so at least one correct) and that no cheating was involved (so Roger must be wrong, and at least one of the others correct). \n\nTherefore, the formula would be:\n\nProbability that Roger is wrong (1/3) multiplied by the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nAlan's probability correct: 1/5, Peter's 5/6. The probability that at least one of them is correct is 1 - (probability both wrong). \n\nAlan wrong is 4/5, Peter wrong is 1/6. So 4/5 * 1/6 = 4/30 = 2/15. So 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nThen multiply by 1/3 (since Roger must be wrong): (13/15)*(1/3) = 13/45. Which is option E. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45. So 13/45 is E, which would be the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nAnother approach: The question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. The question's correct answer is considered, but perhaps it's about the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly without cheating, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, the question might be interpreted as the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly, and that all correct answers were not obtained via cheating. \n\nSo, in other words, all correct answers (if any) must come from non-cheaters (Alan or Peter), and Roger must have not answered correctly. Because if Roger answered correctly, then there's a correct answer via cheating, so the \"but not via cheating\" would exclude that. \n\nTherefore, the scenarios where the question is answered correctly without cheating are exactly those where Roger is incorrect, and at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is as I did before: (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45, which is E. \n\nHmm, but let me check if there's another possible interpretation. Suppose that the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, but none of the correct answers were cheating. So, if both Alan and Peter got it right, and Roger didn't, that's acceptable. But if Roger got it right and someone else did too, then it's excluded. \n\nYes, that's exactly what I considered. So the calculation seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one was not cheating. In that case, the calculation would be different. Let's see:\n\nThe cases would be:\n\nCase 1: Alan correct, Roger wrong, Peter wrong. \n\nProbability: (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (1/5)*(1/3)*(1/6) = 1/(90)\n\nCase 2: Peter correct, Alan wrong, Roger wrong. \n\nProbability: (4/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (4/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (20/30)*(1/3) = (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9. Wait, let me calculate again:\n\nWait, (4/5)*(5/6) is (4/5)*(5/6) = (20/30) = 2/3. Then multiplied by 1/3 (Roger wrong): 2/3 *1/3 = 2/9. \n\nCase 3: Both Alan and Peter correct, Roger wrong. \n\nProbability: (1/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (5/30)*(1/3) = (1/6)*(1/3) = 1/18. \n\nAdding all three cases: 1/90 + 2/9 +1/18. Let's compute that:\n\nConvert to 90 denominator:\n\n1/90 + (2/9)*(10/10) = 20/90, plus (1/18)*(5/5)=5/90. So total is 1+20+5=26/90 \u2192 13/45. Which is the same result as before. \n\nAh! So whether you consider the case where exactly one or both non-cheaters are correct (as long as Roger is wrong), the total probability is 13/45. So that's the same as before. Therefore, the answer is E)13/45.\n\nWait, but why did the second approach (cases) give the same result? Because the first approach considered \"at least one of Alan or Peter\" which includes all three cases (only Alan, only Peter, both). So yes, that's why the same result. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E. Let me check again the options. The options are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nYes, E is there. So the answer should be E.\n",

So, in other words, the correct answers (if any) must come from Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer must be incorrect. Because if Roger's answer is correct, even if others are correct, the fact that Roger cheated means that the correct answer was obtained via cheating. Therefore, the desired probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo, to compute that, we can calculate the probability that Roger is incorrect (so 1 - 2/3 = 1/3), multiplied by the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct.\n\nWait, let's break it down:\n\nThe total desired probability is P(Roger is incorrect) * [1 - P(Alan incorrect AND Peter incorrect)]. Because for at least one of Alan or Peter to be correct, it's the complement of both being incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the formula would be:\n\nP(Roger incorrect) * [1 - P(Alan wrong) * P(Peter wrong)]\n\nBecause the events of Alan and Peter's answers are independent, right? So the probability that both Alan and Peter are wrong is (1 - 1/5)*(1 -5/6) = (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. Therefore, the probability that at least one of them is correct is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15.\n\nSo then, the overall probability would be (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45? Wait, but 13/45 is one of the options (option E). Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one was not cheating. But that might not be the case. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem states \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". The wording might mean that the correct answer was achieved without any cheating. So, the scenario where the question is answered correctly, but the correct answer did not come from cheating. Since Roger's method is cheating, so the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, but also, Roger's answer must not have been correct (since if he got it right, then the correct answer could have been via cheating). Therefore, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and Roger must have not gotten it right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe even if Roger got it right, but someone else also did without cheating, then the correct answer is via cheating? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous here. The problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So perhaps the entire correct answer must not have been obtained through cheating, so any correct answer from Roger would disqualify it. Therefore, the scenario is that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of the three answered correctly, and that one was not cheating. But that would be different. For example, if both Alan and Peter got it right, then that's still acceptable. So perhaps the correct approach is as I first thought: the probability that the question was answered correctly (so at least one correct) and that no cheating was involved (so Roger must be wrong, and at least one of the others correct). \n\nTherefore, the formula would be:\n\nProbability that Roger is wrong (1/3) multiplied by the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nAlan's probability correct: 1/5, Peter's 5/6. The probability that at least one of them is correct is 1 - (probability both wrong). \n\nAlan wrong is 4/5, Peter wrong is 1/6. So 4/5 * 1/6 = 4/30 = 2/15. So 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nThen multiply by 1/3 (since Roger must be wrong): (13/15)*(1/3) = 13/45. Which is option E. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45. So 13/45 is E, which would be the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nAnother approach: The question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. The question's correct answer is considered, but perhaps it's about the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly without cheating, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, the question might be interpreted as the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly, and that all correct answers were not obtained via cheating. \n\nSo, in other words, all correct answers (if any) must come from non-cheaters (Alan or Peter), and Roger must have not answered correctly. Because if Roger answered correctly, then there's a correct answer via cheating, so the \"but not via cheating\" would exclude that. \n\nTherefore, the scenarios where the question is answered correctly without cheating are exactly those where Roger is incorrect, and at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is as I did before: (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45, which is E. \n\nHmm, but let me check if there's another possible interpretation. Suppose that the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, but none of the correct answers were cheating. So, if both Alan and Peter got it right, and Roger didn't, that's acceptable. But if Roger got it right and someone else did too, then it's excluded. \n\nYes, that's exactly what I considered. So the calculation seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one was not cheating. In that case, the calculation would be different. Let's see:\n\nThe cases would be:\n\nCase 1: Alan correct, Roger wrong, Peter wrong. \n\nProbability: (1/5) * (1/3) * (1/6) = (1/5)*(1/3)*(1/6) = 1/(90)\n\nCase 2: Peter correct, Alan wrong, Roger wrong. \n\nProbability: (4/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (4/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (20/30)*(1/3) = (2/3)*(1/3) = 2/9. Wait, let me calculate again:\n\nWait, (4/5)*(5/6) is (4/5)*(5/6) = (20/30) = 2/3. Then multiplied by 1/3 (Roger wrong): 2/3 *1/3 = 2/9. \n\nCase 3: Both Alan and Peter correct, Roger wrong. \n\nProbability: (1/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (5/30)*(1/3) = (1/6)*(1/3) = 1/18. \n\nAdding all three cases: 1/90 + 2/9 +1/18. Let's compute that:\n\nConvert to 90 denominator:\n\n1/90 + (2/9)*(10/10) = 20/90, plus (1/18)*(5/5)=5/90. So total is 1+20+5=26/90 \u2192 13/45. Which is the same result as before. \n\nAh! So whether you consider the case where exactly one or both non-cheaters are correct (as long as Roger is wrong), the total probability is 13/45. So that's the same as before. Therefore, the answer is E)13/45.\n\nWait, but why did the second approach (cases) give the same result? Because the first approach considered \"at least one of Alan or Peter\" which includes all three cases (only Alan, only Peter, both). So yes, that's why the same result. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E. Let me check again the options. The options are:\n\nA)1/18\n\nB)1/9\n\nC)23/90\n\nD)5/18\n\nE)13/45\n\nYes, E is there. So the answer should be E.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we need to consider the scenarios where either Alan or Peter (non-cheaters) answer correctly, while Roger (the cheater) answers incorrectly. \n\n1. **Roger's probability of being incorrect**:  \n   Roger's chance of answering incorrectly is \\(1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct**:  \n   Calculate the complement of both being incorrect.  \n   - Alan's incorrect probability: \\(1 - \\frac{1}{5} = \\frac{4}{5}\\).  \n   - Peter's incorrect probability: \\(1 - \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{1}{6}\\).  \n   - Both incorrect: \\(\\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15}\\).  \n   - At least one correct: \\(1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}\\).\n\n3. **Combine the probabilities**:  \n   Multiply the probability Roger is incorrect by the probability at least one non-cheater is correct:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{13}{15} = \\frac{13}{45}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating is \\(\\frac{13}{45}\\).\n\nAnswer: E",
