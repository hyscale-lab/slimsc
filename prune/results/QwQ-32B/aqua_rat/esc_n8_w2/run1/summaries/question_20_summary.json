      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have to solve this equation and find which option is correct. The equation given is [5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 -7] divided by [13 \u00d713 -156] equals 6. Hmm, right. So I need to find the value of the question mark that makes this equation true.\n\nFirst, I should probably rewrite the equation to make it clearer. Let me parse the numerator and denominator separately. The numerator is 5 plus something multiplied by 19, then minus 15 and 7. Wait, the order of operations is important here. Oh right, multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So the question mark is multiplied by 19 first, then added to 5, and then subtract 15 and 7? Or is it 5 plus (question mark \u00d719) minus 15 minus7? Yeah, that's how it should be parsed because multiplication has higher precedence.\n\nSo let me write the equation step by step. Let me denote the unknown as x for simplicity. So the equation is:\n\n[5 + x*19 -15 -7] / [13*13 -156] = 6\n\nFirst, compute the denominator first. Let's compute the denominator part first. 13 multiplied by 13 is 169. Then subtract 156. 169 minus 156 is 13. So the denominator simplifies to 13. That's straightforward.\n\nSo now the equation becomes ( numerator ) / 13 = 6. Therefore, the numerator must be equal to 6 multiplied by 13. Let me check that: 6 times 13 is 78. So the numerator must equal 78.\n\nNow I can set up the equation for the numerator: 5 + x*19 -15 -7 = 78.\n\nLet me simplify the left side. Let's combine the constants first. The constants are 5, -15, and -7. Adding those together: 5 -15 is -10, then minus 7 gives -17. So the equation becomes:\n\nx*19 -17 = 78.\n\nWait, let me make sure. The numerator is 5 + (x*19) minus15 minus7. So yes, that's x*19 plus (5 -15 -7). 5-15 is -10, minus7 more is -17. So yes, x*19 -17 =78.\n\nNow, solving for x. Let's add 17 to both sides:\n\nx*19 = 78 +17 \u2192 95.\n\nSo x = 95 divided by 19. Let me do that division. 19 times 5 is 95. So x is 5. Wait, that would be option C, right?\n\nWait, let me double-check all steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nFirst, denominator: 13\u00d713 is 169. 169-156 is indeed 13. Then the numerator must be 6\u00d713=78. Then the numerator equation: 5 +19x -15 -7. Let's compute the constants again. 5-15 is -10, then subtract 7 gives -17. So 19x -17 =78 \u2192 19x=95 \u2192 x=5. So the answer is C)5. Let me check the options. Yes, option C is 5. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, let me check if I made any mistake in the order of operations.\n\nWait, the numerator is 5 + x*19 -15 -7. The multiplication comes first, so yes, x multiplied by 19 is done first. Then adding 5, then subtract 15 and 7. So that's correct. So yes, 5 plus (x*19) minus 15 minus7. So all steps are correct. So the correct answer is C.\n",

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me rewrite the equation to make it clearer. The numerator is (5 + ? \u00d719 -15 -7) and the denominator is (13\u00d713 -156). The whole fraction equals 6. So, I can write this as:\n\n[ (5 + (? \u00d719) -15 -7) ] / [ (13\u00d713 - 156) ] = 6\n\nHmm, maybe I should compute the denominator first because that might be simpler.

So:\n\n5 + x*19 -15 -7 = 78\n\nLet me simplify the constants first. 5 minus 15 is -10, then minus another 7 gives -17. So the equation becomes:\n\nx*19 -17 = 78\n\nWait, adding up the constants: 5 -15 is -10, then subtract 7 more gives -17. So yeah, that's right. So then, solving for x:\n\nx*19 = 78 +17 \u2192 95\n\nSo x = 95 / 19. Let me do that division. 19 times 5 is 95. So 95 divided by 19 is 5. So x is 5. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5.

Then subtract 15 gives 85, then subtract 7 gives 78. Perfect, that's exactly what's needed. \n\nSo yes, 5 is the correct answer. The options list C as 5, so that's the right choice. The other options: 4 would give 4\u00d719=76. Adding 5 gives 81, then subtract 22 (15+7) would be 59, which is way off. So yeah, definitely C.\n",
