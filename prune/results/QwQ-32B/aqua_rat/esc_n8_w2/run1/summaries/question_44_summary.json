      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding a 5-digit number such that if you put a 1 after it, the number becomes three times as large as when you put a 1 before it. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me think how to set this up.\n\nSo let me call the original number N. Since it's a 5-digit number, N is between 10000 and 99999. The problem says that if we append a 1 at the end (which is the same as multiplying by 10 and adding 1), the result is three times the number formed by putting a 1 before it. Putting a 1 before would mean adding 100000 (since it's a 5-digit number, adding a digit at the front would be like 1 followed by N). Wait, actually, putting a 1 before the number would be 100000 + N, right? Because for example, if N was 12345, putting a 1 before gives 112345, which is 100000 + 12345.\n\nOn the other hand, putting a 1 after the number would be N * 10 + 1. So the equation should be:\n\nN * 10 + 1 = 3 * (100000 + N)\n\nIs that right? Let me check again. Yes, because appending a 1 is multiplying by 10 and adding 1. Putting a 1 before is adding 100000 (since it's a 5-digit number). So the equation makes sense.\n\nNow let's solve this equation for N. Let's expand the right side:\n\n10N + 1 = 300000 + 3N\n\nSubtract 3N from both sides:\n\n7N + 1 = 300000\n\nThen subtract 1:\n\n7N = 299,999\n\nWait, 300,000 minus 1 is 299,999. Then N = 299,999 divided by 7. Let me calculate that.\n\nHmm, 299,999 \u00f7 7. Let me do the division. Let's see 7 \u00d7 42,857 is... Let me calculate 42,857 \u00d7 7. Let's see:\n\n42,857 \u00d77: 40,000 \u00d77 = 280,000; 2,857 \u00d77 is 20,000 - wait, 2,857\u00d77 is 20,000? Wait no. Let's compute 2,857 \u00d77:\n\n2,000 \u00d77 =14,000\n\n800\u00d77=5,600 \u2192 total so far 19,600\n\n50\u00d77=350 \u2192 19,950\n\n7\u00d77=49 \u2192 total 19,999. So adding to the 280,000 gives 299,999. Oh! So 42,857 \u00d77 is exactly 299,999. Therefore N is 42857. Which is option A. Let me check the options again. Option A is 42857. \n\nWait, let me confirm with the problem. Let's test it. Let's take the number 42857. Append a 1 at the end: 428571. Then putting a 1 before would be 142857. Wait, 3 times 142857 is 428571. Exactly! Because 142,857 \u00d73 is 428,671? Wait, wait, hold on, no, wait a second. Wait, 142,857 \u00d7 3: Let me compute that again. 142,857 \u00d73. Let's see:\n\n142,857 \u00d73: 100,000\u00d73=300,000; 40,000\u00d73=120,000 \u2192 total 420,000. Then 2,000 \u00d73=6,000 \u2192 426,000. 857\u00d73=2,571. So total is 426,000 + 2,571 = 428,571. Oh right! So 142,857 \u00d73 is 428,571. Which matches exactly the number with a 1 appended. So yes, that works. So the correct answer is A.\n",

So the question is about finding a 5-digit number that when you put a 1 after it, the number becomes three times as large as when you put a 1 before it.
