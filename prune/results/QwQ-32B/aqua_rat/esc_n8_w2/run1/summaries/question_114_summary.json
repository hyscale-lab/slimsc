      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a fan blade. Let me see, the question is asking for the distance traveled by a point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds. The fan is rotating at 300 revolutions per minute, and the point is 10 centimeters from the center. Hmm, right. I need to figure out how far that point travels in that time. \n\nFirst, I remember that the distance traveled in circular motion is related to the circumference of the circle and the number of revolutions. The formula for circumference is 2\u03c0r, right? Since the radius here is 10 cm, each full revolution would mean the point travels 2 * \u03c0 * 10 cm. Let me write that down. \n\nSo circumference C = 2\u03c0r = 2 * \u03c0 * 10 = 20\u03c0 cm per revolution. Got that part. \n\nNow, the fan is spinning at 300 revolutions per minute. But the time given is 30 seconds, which is half a minute. So I need to find out how many revolutions occur in 30 seconds. Let's see. 300 revolutions per minute is the same as 300 RPM. To get revolutions in 30 seconds, I can divide by 2 because 30 seconds is half a minute. So that's 300 / 2 = 150 revolutions in 30 seconds. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If in one minute (60 seconds) it does 300 revolutions, then in 30 seconds, which is half the time, it should do half the number of revolutions. Yep, so 300 * (30/60) = 150. That's correct. \n\nSo total distance traveled would be the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference. So 150 revolutions * 20\u03c0 cm/rev. Let me calculate that. 150 * 20 is... 150 times 20. Hmm, 15*20 is 300, so 150*20 is 3000. So 3000\u03c0 cm? Wait, but looking at the options, D is 3000\u03c0. But hold on, let me double-check everything because sometimes I might mix up radius and diameter. Wait, the radius is 10 cm, so circumference is 2\u03c0r = 20\u03c0, which is right. So the calculation seems right. \n\nWait, but wait another second. Let me check the options again. Option A is 750\u03c0, B 1500, C 1875, D 3000, E 7500. So according to my calculation, D would be the answer. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the time conversion. Let's see. The fan speed is 300 RPM. So per second, that's 300 divided by 60, which is 5 revolutions per second. Then over 30 seconds, that's 5 * 30 = 150 revolutions. So that's the same as before. So 150 * 20\u03c0 = 3000\u03c0. So that's D. But let me check again the problem statement. \n\nWait, the question says \"a point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center\". Oh, wait, the radius is 10 cm. So the circumference is indeed 2\u03c0*10 = 20\u03c0. So that part's correct. \n\nHmm, but why is option B 1500\u03c0? Maybe I did something wrong here. Let me see: 300 RPM is 5 per second. 30 seconds gives 150. 150 times 20\u03c0 is 3000. Yeah, that's right. So maybe the answer is D. But I need to check again. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a trick here? Like maybe they want the answer in terms of angular velocity or something else? Wait, no, the question is straightforward: distance traveled by the point. So linear distance, which is indeed number of revolutions times circumference. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recalculate 150 * 20\u03c0. 150 * 20 is 3000. Yeah. So D is correct. But let me check the options again. The options are A)750pi, B)1500pi, C)1875pi, D)3000pi, E)7500pi. So D is there. \n\nWait, but maybe I misread the question. Let me check once more. The radius is 10 cm. The time is 30 seconds. Fan speed 300 RPM. So yeah, everything checks out. So the answer should be D. \n\nWait, but I have a feeling that maybe the question is trying to trick me with revolutions per minute versus seconds? But I converted the time correctly. 30 seconds is 0.5 minutes, so 300 * 0.5 is 150. So that's right. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again step by step. \n\n1. Find the circumference: 2\u03c0r = 20\u03c0 cm. \n2. Find the number of revolutions in 30 seconds: 300 RPM is 5 per second (since 300/60 =5). So 5 *30 =150 revolutions. \n3. Multiply them: 150 *20\u03c0 = 3000\u03c0 cm. \n\nSo that's D. So the answer must be D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question says \"rate of 300 revolutions per minutes\"\u2014so that's correct. Yeah. \n\nHmm. I think that's right. I can't find an error here. So I'll go with D.\n",

Alright, first, let me parse all the given information.\n\nThe point is on the edge, 10 centimeters from the center. So that's the radius, right? The radius of the fan blade is 10 cm. The fan is rotating at 300 revolutions per minute. We need the distance after 30 seconds. \n\nWait, units might be an issue here. The time given is in seconds, but the rotation rate is per minute. So I need to convert either the time to minutes or the rate to per second. Let me think. Let's see, 30 seconds is half a minute. So maybe that's easier. \n\nFirst, find out how many revolutions the fan makes in 30 seconds. Since it's 300 revolutions per minute, then in one minute (60 seconds) it's 300 revolutions. So in 30 seconds, that's half the time, so half the number of revolutions. 300 divided by 2 is 150. So 150 revolutions in 30 seconds.\n\nNow, each revolution, the point on the edge travels the circumference of the circle. The circumference formula is 2 * pi * r. The radius here is 10 cm, so circumference is 2 * pi * 10 = 20 pi centimeters per revolution.\n\nSo total distance is number of revolutions multiplied by circumference. That would be 150 revolutions * 20 pi cm/rev. Let me calculate that. 150 times 20 is 3000. So 3000 pi cm. Hmm, looking at the options, D is 3000pi. But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate. Let me go step by step again. \n\nFirst, the rotational speed is 300 RPM (revolutions per minute). Time is 30 seconds, which is 0.5 minutes.

Let me see another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe converting RPM to revolutions per second first. 300 RPM is 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second. Then over 30 seconds, that's 5 *30 = 150. Same as before. Then circumference same as before. So same result. So D is correct. But wait, the options include E)7500pi. That's way bigger.
