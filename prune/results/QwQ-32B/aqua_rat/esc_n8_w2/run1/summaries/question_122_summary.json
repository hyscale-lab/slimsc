      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about a cyclist traveling at 12 miles per hour and how long it takes to go 48 miles. The options are given, and I need to pick the right one. Hmm, I remember that time equals distance divided by speed. Wait, right, the formula is time = distance divided by speed. But the answer needs to be in minutes, so I have to convert hours to minutes after calculating.\n\nSo first, let's do the division. 48 miles divided by 12 mph. Let me calculate that. 48 divided by 12 is 4. Oh, so that gives 4 hours. But the question asks for minutes. Oh right, because the options are in minutes. So 4 hours multiplied by 60 minutes per hour would be 240 minutes. Let me check the options again. Option B is 240, so that must be the answer. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. \n\nWait, the speed is 12 mph, so in one hour, the cyclist covers 12 miles. To do 48, that's 4 times as far, so 4 hours. Yep, that makes sense. Converting 4 hours into minutes: 4 x 60 is indeed 240. So the answer should be B)240. Let me look at the options again to confirm. The options are A)1 (way too short), B)240, C)30 (that's 0.5 hours), D)60 (1 hour), E)120 (2 hours). Oh wait, 4 hours is 240, so B is correct. I think that's right. No, wait did I do the division correctly? 12 times 4 is 48, yes. So the time is 4 hours. Yep, so the answer is B.\n",

The question is asking for the time in minutes, right? Alright, first, I remember that time equals distance divided by speed. So the basic formula is time = distance / speed. \n\nThe distance here is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. Plugging those numbers in, time would be 48 divided by 12.

Option B is 240. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The speed is 12 mph, so in one hour, the cyclist covers 12 miles. So for 48 miles, how many hours? 48 divided by 12 is indeed 4 hours. Converting that to minutes, 4*60 is 240. Yeah, that seems right. Let me look at the options again. The options are A)1, which is way too small. B)240, which matches. C)30, that's half an hour. D)60 is an hour, which would be way too short. E)120 is two hours. Wait, no, 120 minutes is two hours. But 4 hours is 240. So B has to be correct. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes here. So the answer should be B.\n",
