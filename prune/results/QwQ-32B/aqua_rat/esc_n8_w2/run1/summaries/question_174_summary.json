      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out this tire cost problem. Let me read it again carefully. The tires when new last four years. The customer can buy new ones at $180 each or repair current ones for $40 a tire, which extends their life by one more year. The question is asking for the percentage increase in the average annual cost of the new tires compared to repairing the current ones.\n\nHmm, right. Let me break this down. Let's see, first, I need to calculate the average cost per year for both options and then find the percentage difference.\n\nStarting with the new tires: If they cost $180 each and last four years, the average cost per year would be 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180 /4 is 45. So that's $45 per year.\n\nNow for the repair option. The repair costs $40 per tire and extends the life by one year. Wait, but how many years are we considering here? The problem says \"the current tires\" which I assume are already being used, but how old are they? Wait, maybe the repair is an option each year? Or is the repair extending the original four-year lifespan?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the current tires are already three years old, so they have one year left, and the repair would add another year? Or perhaps the problem is that the current tires can be repaired each year to extend their life. Hmm, the question might be a bit ambiguous. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem states that when purchased new, the tires last four years. The customer can choose to buy new tires (so paying $180 each) or repair current tires at $40 per tire, which will make them last for one additional year. So each repair gives one more year. But how many repairs can be done? Or is the question comparing the two options over a certain period?\n\nWait, the question is asking for the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the cost of repairing the current tires. So perhaps the repair option is only for one year? Or maybe the customer can choose between buying new (which gives four years of use) or repairing the current tires (which gives one more year). But then the comparison is between the average cost over four years for new tires versus over one year for the repair? That doesn't make sense because the time periods would differ. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair is a one-time repair that adds a year, so the current tires would last 5 years total? Wait, the original lifespan is four years. If you repair them, they last one additional year. So the total lifespan becomes 5 years. Wait, but then the repair cost would be a one-time $40, so the average cost over five years would be 40 /5 = 8 per year? Or is the repair done each year?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me parse the problem again.\n\nThe problem says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So perhaps each repair adds one year, so you can repair them multiple times? But the question is about comparing the average cost per year of the new tires versus the repair option. Maybe the customer is considering whether to buy new now or repair the current tires. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the customer has current tires that have already been used for some time. Let me think of the scenario where the customer is at a point where they can choose between buying new tires (which will last 4 more years) or repairing the current tires (which would give them one more year). But then the question is about the average cost per year for each option. But the time periods would be different. So perhaps the problem is that the customer is choosing between two options over the same period of time?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is comparing the average cost over the same number of years. Let me think of it this way.\n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180. They last four years. So average cost per year is 180 /4 = $45/year.\n\nOption 2: Repair the current tires for $40, which gives one additional year. So the cost per year would be 40 /1 = $40/year. But that would be a lower cost. Wait, but then the average cost of new tires is higher than the repair. The question is asking how much greater the new tires' average cost is compared to the repair's. \n\nWait, but that would be (45 -40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125, so 12.5% which is option C. But let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I'm oversimplifying. Maybe the repair is a one-time cost that gives one more year, so the average over that one year is 40. But perhaps the customer would need to consider multiple repairs? For example, if they choose to repair each year, then over four years, they would pay 40 each year, totaling 160, so average 40 per year. But if they buy new tires, it's 180 over four years, so 45. The difference is 5, so 5/40 is 12.5%. That would make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires have already been used for three years, so they have one more year left. So if they repair them, they get an extra year, making it two years total (the remaining one plus the added one). Wait, no, the original lifespan is four years. If they are at year three, they have one left. Repairing would add one, making it two more years? Or total five?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is considering the repair as an option when the tires are about to expire. Let me think of it this way: Suppose the current tires have exactly one year left. If the customer repairs them now, they can get one more year, so total two years from now? Or perhaps the original tires were new, and each repair adds a year. Maybe the problem is not about the remaining time but the total lifespan. Let's try a different approach.\n\nThe problem says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So the average cost for new tires is 180 divided by their lifespan (4 years) which is 45. The repair's cost per year would be 40 divided by the number of years the repair covers. Since the repair gives an additional year, the repair's cost is for 1 year, so 40 per year. \n\nTherefore, the new tires average 45 per year, repair is 40 per year. The difference is 5. To find what percent greater, the formula is (45-40)/40 *100 = 12.5%. So that would be option C. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that the repair is only for one year. The problem says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So the repair gives one more year. So the cost of the repair is 40 per tire for one year. So the average cost per year for the repair is 40/1 =40. The new tires are 180/4=45. \n\nTherefore, the percentage increase from 40 to 45 is (5/40)*100 = 12.5%. That would be answer C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the customer can choose to repair the tires multiple times? Like, if they repair each year, then over four years, they'd pay 40 each year, totaling 160, same as 40 per year. But the new tires cost 180 over four years, so 45. So the calculation would still be the same. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the repair is a one-time repair that adds a year to the current tires' lifespan, so if the current tires have already been used for three years (so one left), then repairing them would give two more years (original one plus the added one). Wait, but the original lifespan is four years. If they have three years of use, they have one left. Adding one more would make it two total? Or five total? Wait, the problem says \"make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So the total lifespan would be original plus one. So if the original was four, then after repair, it's five years total. But the customer is choosing between buying new (four years) or repairing (which gives five years). Wait, that might complicate things.\n\nWait, maybe the customer is at the point where the tires are about to expire. So the current tires are at four years, so they need to be replaced. The options are either buy new (four more years) or repair them for $40 to get one more year. But then the repair would only last one year, so comparing over one year, the new tires would cost 180 (for four years) but if you only need one more year, perhaps that's not the right way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the customer is comparing over the same time period. For instance, over four years, buying new would cost 180, but repairing each year would cost 40 per year for four years, totaling 160. So the average cost per year for new is 45 vs repair's 40. So the difference is 5, 5/40 is 12.5%.\n\nAlternatively, if the customer chooses to repair once, getting one more year, then the cost for that one year is 40. But if they want to go for four years, they would have to repair four times, each time paying 40. So total 160 over four years, which is again 40 per year. So either way, the average cost is 40 per year for repair over four years. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 12.5%, which is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%. So 12.5 is option C. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate:\n\nNew tires: 180 /4 =45 per year.\n\nRepair: 40 per year (since each repair gives one year, so per year cost is 40). \n\nSo the difference between 45 and 40 is 5. \n\nTo find what percentage greater: (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer must be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about comparing the average annual cost of new tires versus repairing the current ones. Hmm, I need to calculate the average cost per year for each option and then find the percentage difference. \n\nFirst, the new tires cost $180 each and last four years. So the average cost per year for new tires would be 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that. 180 divided by 4 is 45. So that's $45 per year.\n\nNow, the current tires can be repaired for $40 per tire, and that repair extends their life by one year. Wait, but how many years do the current tires last originally? The question says when purchased new, they last four years, but the customer already has current tires. Oh wait, maybe the current tires are already being used? Wait, the problem isn't clear on how old the current tires are. Wait, the question might be implying that the customer is choosing between buying new ones now (which would last four more years) or repairing the current ones (which would make them last one more year). Or perhaps the current tires are at the point where they need a repair to extend their life, but I need to read the question again.\n\nLet me read again. The problem states: \"Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" \n\nAh, so the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year. So the repair cost is for one additional year. So the current tires, after being repaired, will last one more year. Wait, but does that mean that without the repair, they would only last, say, three years? Or is the repair adding an extra year to their current remaining life? Hmm, the problem says \"make the current tires last for one additional year\". So maybe the current tires, if not repaired, would only last one year? Because the new ones last four. Wait, perhaps the customer is considering replacing the current tires which are already three years old? Not sure. The question might be assuming that the current tires, when repaired, give an extra year. So the repair's cost is $40 per tire for one more year of use. \n\nThe problem is asking for the average cost per year of new tires compared to the cost of repairing. Wait, the question says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" \n\nWait, maybe I need to compare the average annual cost of new tires versus the average annual cost of the repair option. \n\nLet me structure this. \n\nFor the new tires: Cost is $180 per tire, and they last 4 years. So average annual cost is 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: The repair costs $40 per tire, and that gives one additional year. So the cost per year for the repair would be $40 divided by 1 year, which is $40 per year. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Because the repair is a one-time cost for one year's extension. So the average cost per year for the repair is indeed 40/1 = $40 per year. \n\nTherefore, the average cost of new tires is $45 per year, repair is $40. The question is asking by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater than the repair's. \n\nTo find the percentage increase from 40 to 45, the formula is ((45 -40)/40)*100. \n\nCalculating that: 5/40 is 0.125, so 12.5%. So that's 12.5% greater. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5%. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nWait, maybe the current tires already have some remaining life. Like, maybe the customer's current tires are about to expire after one year, so they can choose to either buy new ones (which would last four years from now) or repair them (which would make them last one more year). But the question says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an ongoing cost? Like, each year you can repair them again? But the problem says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year\". So each repair gives one more year. But the problem is comparing the new tires (which last four years) versus the repair option. \n\nWait, perhaps the customer has to choose between two options over a certain period. For instance, if the customer is looking to have tires for four years, then buying new would cost $180, but repairing the current ones would require four repairs? Wait, but that's not stated. The problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" \n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider that the repair is a one-time cost for one year. So the average cost for the repair is $40 per year (since it's $40 for one year), whereas the new tires cost $45 per year over four years. \n\nAlternatively, if the customer chooses to repair the current tires, perhaps they can do so multiple times? Like, each year you can repair them for another year. But the question is comparing the average annual cost of each option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the current tires' remaining life. Suppose the current tires are at the end of their lifespan and need to be either replaced or repaired for one more year. So the customer has two choices: buy new tires (which would last four years) or repair the current ones (which will last one more year). So the comparison is over the period of one year (the repair) versus four years (new tires). But the average cost per year would be calculated over their respective lifespans. \n\nWait, that's exactly what the question is saying. The average cost per year for the new tires is over their four-year lifespan, and the average cost for the repair is over its one-year lifespan. So the calculation I did earlier is correct. \n\nThus, the average cost of new is $45/year, repair is $40/year. The percentage increase from 40 to 45 is (5/40)*100=12.5%, which is option C. \n\nHmm, but let me check again the options. The options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%. So 12.5% is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me think again. Suppose the customer is comparing the cost of getting four more years (with new tires) versus getting one more year (with repair). But the question is about the average per year of each option. So yes, the average for new is 180/4, repair is 40/1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair can be done multiple times. For instance, if the customer chooses to repair each year, then over four years, they would pay 40 each year, totaling $160, which is more expensive than buying new. But the question is about the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repair's cost. Since the repair's cost is per year (each repair gives a year), then the average annual cost of repair is 40 per year. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. The answer should be C, 12.5%.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The question is about comparing the average annual cost of new tires versus repairing the current ones. Hmm, I need to calculate the average cost per year for each option and then find the percentage difference. \n\nFirst, the new tires cost $180 each and last four years. So the average cost per year for new tires would be 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that. 180 divided by 4 is 45. So that's $45 per year.\n\nNow, the current tires can be repaired for $40 per tire, and that repair extends their life by one year. Wait, but how many years do the current tires last originally? The question says when purchased new, they last four years, but the customer already has current tires. Oh wait, maybe the current tires are already being used? Wait, the problem isn't clear on how old the current tires are. Wait, the question might be implying that the customer is choosing between buying new ones now (which would last four more years) or repairing the current ones (which would make them last one more year). Or perhaps the current tires are at the point where they need a repair to extend their life, but I need to read the question again.\n\nLet me read again. The problem states: \"Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" \n\nAh, so the current tires, if repaired, will last one more year. So the repair cost is for one additional year. So the current tires, after being repaired, will last one more year. Wait, but does that mean that without the repair, they would only last, say, three years? Or is the repair adding an extra year to their current remaining life? Hmm, the problem says \"make the current tires last for one additional year\". So maybe the current tires, if not repaired, would only last one year? Because the new ones last four. Wait, perhaps the customer is considering replacing the current tires which are already three years old? Not sure. The question might be assuming that the current tires, when repaired, give an extra year. So the repair's cost is $40 per tire for one more year of use. \n\nThe problem is asking for the average cost per year of new tires compared to the cost of repairing. Wait, the question says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" \n\nWait, maybe I need to compare the average annual cost of new tires versus the average annual cost of the repair option. \n\nLet me structure this. \n\nFor the new tires: Cost is $180 per tire, and they last 4 years. So average annual cost is 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nFor the repair option: The repair costs $40 per tire, and that gives one additional year. So the cost per year for the repair would be $40 divided by 1 year, which is $40 per year. \n\nWait, but is that correct? Because the repair is a one-time cost for one year's extension. So the average cost per year for the repair is indeed 40/1 = $40 per year. \n\nTherefore, the average cost of new tires is $45 per year, repair is $40. The question is asking by what percentage the new tires' average cost is greater than the repair's. \n\nTo find the percentage increase from 40 to 45, the formula is ((45 -40)/40)*100. \n\nCalculating that: 5/40 is 0.125, so 12.5%. So that's 12.5% greater. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 12.5%. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. \n\nWait, maybe the current tires already have some remaining life. Like, maybe the customer's current tires are about to expire after one year, so they can choose to either buy new ones (which would last four years from now) or repair them (which would make them last one more year). But the question says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the repair is an ongoing cost? Like, each year you can repair them again? But the problem says \"a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year\". So each repair gives one more year. But the problem is comparing the new tires (which last four years) versus the repair option. \n\nWait, perhaps the customer has to choose between two options over a certain period. For instance, if the customer is looking to have tires for four years, then buying new would cost $180, but repairing the current ones would require four repairs? Wait, but that's not stated. The problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" \n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider that the repair is a one-time cost for one year. So the average cost for the repair is $40 per year (since it's $40 for one year), whereas the new tires cost $45 per year over four years. \n\nAlternatively, if the customer chooses to repair the current tires, perhaps they can do so multiple times? Like, each year you can repair them for another year. But the question is comparing the average annual cost of each option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the current tires' remaining life. Suppose the current tires are at the end of their lifespan and need to be either replaced or repaired for one more year. So the customer has two choices: buy new tires (which would last four years) or repair the current ones (which will last one more year). So the comparison is over the period of one year (the repair) versus four years (new tires). But the average cost per year would be calculated over their respective lifespans. \n\nWait, that's exactly what the question is saying. The average cost per year for the new tires is over their four-year lifespan, and the average cost for the repair is over its one-year lifespan. So the calculation I did earlier is correct. \n\nThus, the average cost of new is $45/year, repair is $40/year. The percentage increase from 40 to 45 is (5/40)*100=12.5%, which is option C. \n\nHmm, but let me check again the options. The options are A)8%, B)10%, C)12.5%, D)16.7%, E)25%. So 12.5% is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me think again. Suppose the customer is comparing the cost of getting four more years (with new tires) versus getting one more year (with repair). But the question is about the average per year of each option. So yes, the average for new is 180/4, repair is 40/1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair can be done multiple times. For instance, if the customer chooses to repair each year, then over four years, they would pay 40 each year, totaling $160, which is more expensive than buying new. But the question is about the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the repair's cost. Since the repair's cost is per year (each repair gives a year), then the average annual cost of repair is 40 per year. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. The answer should be C, 12.5%.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage difference in average annual costs between new tires and repairing current tires:\n\n1. **New Tires Calculation**:\n   - Cost: $180 per tire.\n   - Lifespan: 4 years.\n   - Average annual cost: \\( \\frac{180}{4} = 45 \\) dollars/year.\n\n2. **Repair Option Calculation**:\n   - Cost: $40 per tire for a repair that extends lifespan by 1 year.\n   - Average annual cost: \\( \\frac{40}{1} = 40 \\) dollars/year.\n\n3. **Percentage Increase Calculation**:\n   - The difference in cost: \\( 45 - 40 = 5 \\) dollars.\n   - Percentage increase relative to repair cost: \\( \\frac{5}{40} \\times 100 = 12.5\\% \\).\n\nThe average cost of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the repair option's cost.\n\nAnswer: C",
