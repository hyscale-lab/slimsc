      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is about a boy trying to climb a staircase with 10 steps. He can take either one or two steps at a time, and we need to find out how many different ways he can reach the top. The options are from 88 to 92, so I need to figure out the correct one.\n\nHmm, I remember that this type of problem is similar to the Fibonacci sequence. Let me think. Like, if there's n steps, the number of ways to get there is the sum of the ways to get to n-1 (if he takes a single step from there) and the ways to get to n-2 (if he takes a double step from two steps below). So the formula would be f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). \n\nWait, right, that's exactly how Fibonacci works. So the base cases must be important here. Let's see. For 0 steps, which would be the ground level, there's 1 way (doing nothing). For 1 step, he can only take a single step, so that's 1 way. For 2 steps, he can do two singles or one double, so that's 2 ways. \n\nSo building up from there:\n\nn=0 \u2192 1\nn=1 \u2192 1\nn=2 \u2192 1+1=2\nn=3 \u2192 2+1=3\nn=4 \u2192 3+2=5\nn=5 \u2192 5+3=8\nn=6 \u2192 8+5=13\nWait, but wait, let me do this step by step to be sure. Let me list them all up to 10:\n\nLet me start over:\n\nf(0) = 1 (base case)\nf(1) = 1\nf(2) = f(1) + f(0) = 1+1=2\nf(3) = f(2)+f(1) =2+1=3\nf(4)= f(3)+f(2)=3+2=5\nf(5)=5+3=8\nf(6)=8+5=13\nf(7)=13+8=21\nf(8)=21+13=34\nf(9)=34+21=55\nf(10)=55+34=89\n\nOh wait, so that gives f(10) as 89? So the answer would be B)89? Let me check again because sometimes people get confused whether the starting point is 0 or 1. Let me recount the steps again step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the count. Let me do it again carefully:\n\nStarting from step 0 (ground):\n\nn=0 \u2192 1 way (already there)\nn=1: can only take 1 step, so 1 way \u2192 f(1)=1\nn=2: either 1+1 or 2 \u2192 2 ways \u2192 f(2)=2\nn=3: f(2) + f(1) \u2192 2+1=3 \u2192 3 ways\nn=4: f(3)+f(2)=3+2=5\nn=5:5+3=8\nn=6:8+5=13\nn=7:13+8=21\nn=8:21+13=34\nn=9:34+21=55\nn=10:55+34=89. Yeah, that's the same result.\n\nSo the answer should be B)89. Let me check the options given. The options are A)88, B)89, etc. So B is the correct answer. I think that's right. But wait, sometimes people might think the first step is n=1, but in this case, the problem states 10 steps, so the calculation is correct. So the answer must be B.\n",

Because the first step he takes could be 1, leaving n-1 steps, or 2 steps, leaving n-2 steps. So the total is the sum of those two possibilities.\n\nSo this is exactly the Fibonacci sequence. Let me confirm with a few more steps. For 4 steps: the ways would be 3 (from 3 steps) + 2 (from 2 steps) = 5. And for 5 steps, that would be 5 + 3 = 8.
