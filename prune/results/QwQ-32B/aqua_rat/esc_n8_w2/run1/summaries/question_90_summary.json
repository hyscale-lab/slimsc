      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about selling a book and figuring out the profit or loss percentage when the selling price changes. Let me think through this step by step. \n\nThe question says that the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit. Then, if it's sold for Rs 25.75, what's the new profit or loss percentage? The options are given, so I need to calculate the correct one.\n\nFirst, I need to find the cost price of the book. Since the first selling price gives a 10% profit, I can use that to find the original cost. The formula for selling price when there's a profit is:\n\nSelling Price = Cost Price + (Profit% of Cost Price)\n\nAlternatively, SP = CP \u00d7 (1 + Profit%). \n\nGiven that the SP here is 27.50 and the profit is 10%, so Profit% is 0.10. Plugging into the formula:\n\n27.50 = CP \u00d7 (1 + 0.10)\nSo, 27.50 = 1.10 \u00d7 CP\n\nTo find CP, divide both sides by 1.10. Let me calculate that. \n\n27.50 divided by 1.1. Hmm, 27.5 divided by 1.1. Well, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5, right? Because 25 * 1 =25, 25*0.1 is 2.5, so total 27.5. Oh wait, that's exactly it! So the cost price must be 25 rupees. \n\nOkay, so CP is 25. \n\nNow, the second part is when the book is sold for 25.75. We need to find the new profit or loss percentage. \n\nThe new selling price is 25.75. Since the cost price is 25, let's see if this is a profit or loss. \n\n25.75 is higher than 25, so that would be a profit. Wait, but the options have both profit and loss. Let me check again. Wait, 25.75 is only 0.75 more than 25. Let me compute the profit amount first.\n\nProfit = SP - CP = 25.75 -25 = 0.75 rupees. \n\nTo find the percentage, it's (Profit / CP) *100. \n\nSo 0.75 /25 = 0.03. Multiply by 100 gives 3%. \n\nSo that would be a 3% profit. Looking at the options, option B is 3% Profit. \n\nWait a second, but let me double-check everything. Because sometimes I might have messed up the calculations. Let me re-verify the cost price first. \n\nOriginal SP is 27.50 with 10% profit. \n\nCP = 27.50 /1.10. \n\nYes, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5. So CP is indeed 25. \n\nThen the second SP is 25.75. \n\n25.75 -25 = 0.75 profit. \n\n0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03 \u2192 3%. \n\nHmm, so that's 3% profit. So the answer should be B. \n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss. \n\nYes, so B is there. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently? Wait the problem says \"If it were sold for Rs.25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\" So the new SP is 25.75. Since the CP is 25, selling at 25.75 is a profit of 0.75. \n\nSo profit percentage is (0.75/25)*100=3%, so B. \n\nHmm, so why am I second-guessing? Let me see if there's another way someone might get confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the cost price? Let me try again. \n\nOriginal selling price: 27.50 is after 10% profit. \n\nSo 10% of CP is the profit. So SP = CP + 0.1 CP = 1.1 CP. \n\nThus, 27.50 divided by 1.1 equals CP. \n\n27.50 divided by 1.1: \n\nLet me do the division step by step. \n\n1.1 \u00d7 25 = 27.5, so yes, that's exactly 25. \n\nSo that part is correct. \n\nSo the second SP is 25.75. \n\n25.75 -25 = 0.75 profit. \n\n0.75 over 25 is 3% profit. \n\nSo the correct answer is B. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is asking for something else? Like maybe the percentage relative to the new selling price? No, profit percentage is always calculated on cost price. \n\nYes, profit percentage is (Profit/CP)*100. So that's right. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be B. But wait, looking at the options, there's also a 2% profit. Did I miscalculate the difference?\n\nWait 25.75 minus 25 is 0.75. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03, which is 3%. So yes, 3% profit. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is B.\n",
