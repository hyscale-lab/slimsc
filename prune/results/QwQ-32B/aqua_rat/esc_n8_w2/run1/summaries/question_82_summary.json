      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Julie's yard is a rectangle. Hmm, right, rectangles have opposite sides equal. The problem says one side is 100 feet wide. Wait, so in a rectangle, there's length and width. Let me think, maybe the width here is 100 feet, so the other side would be the length? Or maybe the question is using \"side\" in a different way. Anyway, the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width. The total area is given as 3,000 square feet.\n\nSo, if one of the sides (let's say width is 100 feet), then the other side (length) would be area divided by the width. So 3000 divided by 100. Let me calculate that. 3000 divided by 100 is 30. Wait, that would make the length 30 feet. But looking at the options, option A is 30. So that would be the answer? Wait, maybe I messed up the sides. Like, maybe the 100 feet is the length, and the question is asking for the width? But the formula is the same either way. Because length times width gives area, so whichever is given, the other side is area divided by the given one. So regardless of which side is which, the calculation is 3000 / 100 = 30. So the answer must be A) 30 feet. Let me check the options again. Yes, option A is 30. So that's it.\n",

Hmm, in a rectangle, there are two pairs of equal sides. So maybe the width is 100 feet, and the other side (the length) is what we need to find. The total area is 3000 square feet. \n\nRight, the formula for the area of a rectangle is length multiplied by width. So area = length \u00d7 width. Here, they mention one side is 100 feet. Let me make sure which one they're referring to. Since they used the term \"width\", maybe that's the width, so the other side would be the length. \n\nSo if the width (w) is 100 feet, then the area (A) is length (l) times width (w). So 3000 = l \u00d7 100. To find the length, I can rearrange that equation. So l = A divided by w. That would be 3000 divided by 100. Let me calculate that: 3000 \u00f7 100 equals 30. Wait, that would make the length 30 feet. \n\nLooking at the options, A is 30 feet. So that's probably the answer. But let me double-check. Suppose the question had mixed up length and width? Like, maybe the 100 feet is the length, and the other side is the width. Wait no, the question says \"the other side\" so the sides are length and width. Since area is length times width, regardless of which is which. So even if I considered the 100 as length, then the width would be 3000/100 =30. But the question asks for the length of the other side. So either way, the answer is 30. So option A. \n\nWait the options include 30 as A. Let me check the options again. The options are A)30, B)20, C)10, D)50, E)60. So yes, 30 is an option. So the correct answer must be A. I don't see any other way to interpret the question here. Unless I made a mistake in division. Let me check again: 100 multiplied by 30 is indeed 3000. Yep, that's right. So the answer is A.\n",
