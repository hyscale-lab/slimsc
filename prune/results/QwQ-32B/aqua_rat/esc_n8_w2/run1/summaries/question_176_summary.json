      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out how much interest Jerry's bond accrued at maturity. Let's see. The problem says it's a 1-year $5,000 bond with 12% annual interest, compounded every six months. Hmm, right, compound interest. \n\nFirst, I remember that compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal multiple times over the period. Since it's compounded every six months, that's twice a year. The annual rate is 12%, so I think the rate per compounding period would be half of that, right? Because 12% divided by two. That would be 6% every six months. \n\nThe formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount ($5,000 here).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 0.12).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (which is 2 here).\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years (1 year).\n\nSo plugging in the numbers:\nA = 5000*(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1)\nLet me calculate that step by step. \n\nFirst, 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So each compounding period's rate is 6%. \n\nThen, 1 plus 0.06 is 1.06. \n\nThe exponent is 2*1, so 2. So we raise 1.06 to the power of 2. \n\nCalculating 1.06 squared. Let me do that: 1.06 * 1.06. 1*1 is 1, 1*0.06 is 0.06, 0.06*1 is 0.06, and 0.06*0.06 is 0.0036. Adding those up: 1 + 0.06 + 0.06 + 0.0036 = 1.1236. Wait, actually, that's not the right way. Wait, no, I think I messed up the multiplication. Let me do it properly. 1.06 times 1.06. \n\nMultiplying 1.06 by 1.06:\n1.06 \u00d7 1.06:\nFirst, 1 times 1.06 is 1.06.\nThen 0.06 times 1.06 is 0.0636.\nAdding them together: 1.06 + 0.0636 = 1.1236. Oh right, that's correct. So 1.06 squared is 1.1236. \n\nSo A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let me compute that. \n\n5000 multiplied by 1.1236. Let's break it down. 5000 * 1 is 5000. 5000 * 0.1236 is the additional part. \n\nCalculating 5000 * 0.1236: 5000 * 0.1 is 500, and 5000 * 0.0236 is 5000 * 0.02 is 100, plus 5000 * 0.0036 = 18. So 100 +18 = 118. So 500+118 = 618. So total interest is 618? Wait, because the total amount would be 5000 + 618 = 5618. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the interest accrued, not the total amount. So the interest would be 5618 - 5000 = 618. So the answer should be B) $618? Let me check the options again. Option B is 618, so that's probably the right answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Let me compute 5000 * 1.1236 step by step. \n\nAlternatively, 5000 multiplied by 1.1236. Let's see, 1.1236 * 5000. 1.1236 * 5000 = (1 + 0.1236)*5000 = 5000 + 5000*0.1236. Which is exactly the same as before. 5000*0.1236 is 618. So yes, the interest is 618. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 618. So the correct answer should be B. Let me check the other options to make sure. \n\nOption A is 5102, which would be the total amount if it was simple interest, but no. Wait, simple interest would be 5000*(1 + 0.12*1) = 5600, so the interest would be 600. But since it's compounded, it's higher. So 618 is correct. \n\nAnother way: Let's compute each compounding period step by step. \n\nFirst six months: Principal is $5000. The interest rate for six months is 6%, so 5000 * 0.06 = 300. So after six months, the amount is 5000 + 300 = 5300. \n\nSecond six months: Now the principal is 5300. The interest is 5300 * 0.06. Let's calculate that: 5300 * 0.06 = 318. So after another six months, the total is 5300 + 318 = 5618. \n\nTotal interest is 5618 - 5000 = 618. Yep, that's the same as before. So definitely B is the answer. \n\nThe options given include B as 618, so that's the correct choice.\n",
