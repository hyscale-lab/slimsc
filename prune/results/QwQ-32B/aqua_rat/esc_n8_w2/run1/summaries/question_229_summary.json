      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out this problem about the number of factors a positive integer Q has. The question states that Q has exactly 5 factors, and then there are three statements I, II, III which we have to evaluate. The options are combinations of which of those statements must be true. Let me think through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors of a number relates to its prime factorization. The formula is that if a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p\u2081^a \u00d7 p\u2082^b \u00d7 ... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. So for example, if a number is a square of a prime, like p\u00b2, then its factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, so that's 3 factors. Wait, but in the problem, Q has 5 factors. Hmm, 5 is a prime number, so the product (a+1)(b+1)... must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, that means that the only way to get that product is if one of the exponents plus one is 5, and all others are 1 (but since 5 is prime, actually, the other terms would have to be 1, so the number must have only one prime factor). Wait, let me think again.\n\nLet me see: the number of factors is the product of each exponent plus one. Since 5 is prime, the only way for that product to be 5 is if there's a single term in the product, which is 5. Because 5 can't be broken down into smaller integers multiplied together except 1\u00d75. But since all the exponents are at least 1, the exponents plus one must multiply to 5. So the only possible way is that one of the exponents is 4 (since 4+1=5) and there are no other prime factors. So Q must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because if there were two primes, like p^a * q^b, then (a+1)(b+1) would have to be 5, but 5 can't be factored into two integers greater than 1 except 5\u00d71, so that would require one exponent being 4 and the other exponent being 0, but exponent 0 would mean that prime isn't actually part of the factorization. So yeah, Q must be a prime raised to the 4th power. \n\nWait, but hold on. The question says that Q is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. So according to this reasoning, Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says exactly that. Then what about statement I, which says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, if it's a square of a prime, like p squared, then the number of factors would be (2+1)=3, which is not 5. So statement I would not be correct. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I confused exponents. Let me recast:\n\nSuppose Q is p^4. Then the number of factors is 4+1=5. So that's correct. So Q is the fourth power of a prime. So statement II must be true. Then why is option C (II only) an option here. Let me check the statements again.\n\nStatement I says Q is the square of a prime. But if Q is p^4, then that's (p\u00b2) squared, which is a square, but the base here would be p squared, which might not be prime. For example, if p is 2, then p^4 is 16, which is 4 squared. But 4 isn't prime. So in that case, statement I would not hold. Therefore statement I is not necessarily true.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. Let's see: if Q is the product of two distinct primes, say p and q, then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4, which is less than 5. If it's the product of the same prime twice (i.e., p squared), then factors are 3. So the product of two primes (whether distinct or not) can't give 5 factors. Wait, unless they're multiplied in some other way? Wait, the only way to get five factors is when the number is a fourth power of a prime. So the product of two primes would not be sufficient. So statement III is also not necessarily true.\n\nSo then the only correct statement is II. So the answer would be option C?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Wait, maybe there's a case where Q could be the product of two primes but raised to certain exponents. Let me see. Suppose Q is p^4. Then it's a single prime to the fourth power. So it's not the product of two primes. Unless one of them is to the fourth power. Wait, the product of two primes would require at least two different primes, right? Or does the problem consider the product of two primes even if they are the same? Like, if it's p^4, then maybe you can think of it as p^3 * p^1, but that's not the product of two primes. The product of two primes would be like p * q, which would have (1+1)(1+1) factors. So no, that's four factors. So statement III is not correct.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the product of two prime numbers\". So if the two primes are the same, like p * p, that's p squared, which has three factors. So that also doesn't give five. Therefore III is not correct.\n\nSo then only II must be true. So the answer would be C) II only. But let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)I only\n\nB)III only\n\nC)II only\n\nD)I and II only\n\nE)I and III only\n\nSo according to my reasoning, the correct answer is C.\n\nWait a second, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, the question says \"must be true\". Are there any cases where Q could be the square of a prime and still have five factors? Well, a square of a prime has three factors, so that's not five. So I is not possible. So II must hold. Therefore the correct answer is C. So the answer should be option C. But let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, perhaps there's another scenario. Let me think of numbers with exactly five factors.\n\nTake for example 16. 16 is 2^4. Its factors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. That's five factors. So that's correct. Another example, 81 is 3^4, which has factors 1,3,9,27,81. Five factors. So that works. So any number which is a fourth power of a prime. So statement II is correct. So that's the only one that must be true. So the answer is C.\n\nWait but maybe the question is a trick. Let me check the statements again.\n\nStatement I says Q is the square of a prime. But the square of a prime is p\u00b2, which has three factors. So that can't be. So I is not correct. Statement III: the product of two primes. As I thought, that gives four factors. So III is wrong. Therefore, only II is correct. So the answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly 5 factors. We need to determine which of the statements I, II, or III must be true. \n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors of a number relates to its prime factorization. The formula for the number of factors is to take the exponents of the prime factors, add one to each, and multiply them together. For example, if a number N is factored into primes as N = p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)*(b+1). \n\nThe problem states that Q has 5 factors. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to get 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So, that means the number of factors formula here must be 5. \n\nLooking at possible prime factorizations: \n\nCase 1: If Q is a prime power, like p^k. Then the number of factors is (k +1). So, (k +1) must equal 5. Solving for k gives k =4. So in this case, Q would be p^4, where p is a prime. \n\nAlternatively, could there be another prime factor? Let me think. Suppose Q has two different primes. Let's say Q = p^a * q^b. Then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1). For this product to be 5, since 5 is prime, one of the terms must be 5 and the other 1. But that would mean either a+1=5 and b+1=1, which would mean b=0, but then q^b isn't part of the factorization anymore. Or the other way around. So actually, the only way this works is if the number has a single prime factor raised to the 4th power, because that gives (4+1)=5 factors. \n\nWait, so that would mean that Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says that. But then what about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Hmm. Let's see. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose Q is the square of a prime. Let's say Q = p\u00b2. Then the number of factors would be 2+1=3, which is not 5. So that's not enough. So statement I would be incorrect. But wait, if it's the square of a prime squared again? Like p^4, which would be (p\u00b2)^2. So then Q is the square of a prime squared. So in that case, the square of a prime number (but the prime here would be p squared? Wait, no. Wait, p is prime. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, but p\u00b2 is not prime unless p is 2, but even then 2 squared is 4 which isn't prime. So maybe statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, so the first thought was that Q is p^4, so the fourth power of a prime, which would make statement II correct. \n\nSo in that case, statement II would have to be true. But let's check the other options. \n\nStatement I says Q is the square of a prime. But if Q is p^4, then it's (p\u00b2) squared, but p\u00b2 is not a prime. So that's not the case. So statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, suppose Q was p^4, then Q is indeed a square, because 4 is even. So Q is a square of p squared. But the question is whether it's the square of a prime. Since p is a prime, then p squared is not a prime, so that would not satisfy statement I. Therefore statement I is not necessarily true. \n\nHmm, so then statement II is correct. But wait, let me think again. Are there any other possibilities where Q could have 5 factors besides being a prime to the fourth power? \n\nAnother way to get 5 factors would be if the number is the product of two different primes raised to certain exponents? Let's see. Suppose Q is p^1 * q^1. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. Not 5. If it was p^2 * q^1, then (2+1)(1+1)=6. Still not 5. So no, that can't be. So the only way is that the number is a single prime raised to the 4th power. \n\nTherefore, the correct statements are II. But then looking at the options, option C is \"II only\". But wait, let me check the statements again. \n\nWait the options given are: \n\nA)I only\n\nB)III only\n\nC)II only\n\nD)I and II only\n\nE)I and III only\n\nSo if II must be true, then the answer would be C. But wait, let me check the other statements again. \n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. If Q is p^4, then it's not the product of two primes unless p is multiplied four times. Like p^4 is p*p*p*p, which is four primes multiplied, but not two distinct primes. So statement III is not true. \n\nSo only statement II must be true. So the answer would be option C. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The problem says Q has 5 factors. Let me take an example. Let's pick a prime number, say 2. Then 2^4 is 16. What are the factors of 16? 1,2,4,8,16. That's five factors. So that works. Another example: 3^4 is 81. Its factors are 1,3,9,27,81. Five factors. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. So Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So II is correct. \n\nStatement I says it's the square of a prime. For instance, 2^2 is 4, which has factors 1,2,4. Three factors. Not five. So that's not. \n\nStatement III: product of two primes. For example, 6 is 2\u00d73. Its factors are 1,2,3,6. Four factors. Not five. So that's not. \n\nAlternatively, if the product is of two different primes each to the first power, that gives four factors. If it's the product of a prime squared and another prime, like 12 = 2\u00b2\u00d73, factors are (2+1)(1+1)=6 factors. \n\nSo none of the other options hold. So only II is correct, so the answer is C. \n\nWait, but wait. Wait the options include C as II only. But hold on, maybe I missed another possibility. Let me see. \n\nIs there any other number structure that can give five factors? For instance, if the number is a cube? Like p^3 would have 4 factors, so that's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a fifth power? No, then factors would be 6. \n\nHmm. So the only way to have exactly five factors is when the exponent plus one is 5, so exponent is 4. So the number must be a prime to the fourth power. \n\nTherefore II is correct. \n\nSo the answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are A to E. The question is, which must be true? \n\nWait, but wait, maybe there's a case where Q is the product of two different primes but in some other exponents? Like maybe p^4 is the only way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the number must be a single prime to the fourth. Let me think again. The number of factors is (exponents +1 multiplied). Since 5 is prime, the only possible way is that it's a single exponent of 4. So yeah. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. So the answer letter is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the statements again. \n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime. But Q is p^4, which is (p\u00b2)^2. So technically, it is a square of a composite number (since p is prime, p squared is composite). So the square of a prime would be (prime)^2, but that's only p squared, which has 3 factors. So the statement I is not true. \n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, exactly. \n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. Well, the product of two primes would be p*q, but that gives four factors, so that's not. Alternatively, if it's product of two primes with exponents? Like p^1 * q^1, which gives four factors, so no. \n\nTherefore only II must be true, so answer C. \n\nHmm, but I recall sometimes problems where numbers like 36 have factors, but that's more. Wait, but in this case, the only way to get 5 factors is prime^4. So yeah, the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but wait the options given include C) II only. So that's correct. \n\nWait but I just thought of another possibility. Suppose Q is 1? But 1 has only one factor. So not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick? Like, the fourth power of a prime is also a square of a prime squared. But the square of a prime number (the prime itself squared) would be p squared, which is different. \n\nWait, statement I says \"the square of a prime number\". For example, if Q is (3^2)^2 = 81, then 81 is 3^4. The square of the prime 3 squared is (3^2)^2, but the base here is 3, a prime. Wait, but 3 squared is 9, which is not prime. Wait, the square of a prime number would be like (prime)^2. So if the prime is 3, then (3)^2 is 9, which has three factors. But Q in this case is 81, which is (9)^2, but 9 isn't prime. So the square of a prime number (the base has to be prime). So Q is not the square of a prime, but the square of a composite. So statement I is false. \n\nTherefore, yes, II is correct. So answer is C. \n\nHmm, but looking back at the options, I just want to make sure I didn't misread. Let me check the options again. \n\nOptions:\n\nA)I only\n\nB)III only\n\nC)II only\n\nD)I and II only\n\nE)I and III only\n\nYes, so C is the correct one. So the answer is C.\n",

For example, if a number N is factored into primes as N = p^a * q^b, then the number of factors is (a+1)*(b+1). \n\nThe problem states that Q has 5 factors. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to get 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So, that means the number of factors formula here must be 5. \n\nLooking at possible prime factorizations: \n\nCase 1: If Q is a prime power, like p^k. Then the number of factors is (k +1). So, (k +1) must equal 5. Solving for k gives k =4. So in this case, Q would be p^4, where p is a prime. \n\nAlternatively, could there be another prime factor? Let me think. Suppose Q has two different primes. Let's say Q = p^a * q^b. Then the number of factors would be (a+1)(b+1). For this product to be 5, since 5 is prime, one of the terms must be 5 and the other 1. But that would mean either a+1=5 and b+1=1, which would mean b=0, but then q^b isn't part of the factorization anymore. Or the other way around. So actually, the only way this works is if the number has a single prime factor raised to the 4th power, because that gives (4+1)=5 factors. \n\nWait, so that would mean that Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says that. But then what about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Hmm. Let's see. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose Q is the square of a prime. Let's say Q = p\u00b2. Then the number of factors would be 2+1=3, which is not 5. So that's not enough. So statement I would be incorrect. But wait, if it's the square of a prime squared again? Like p^4, which would be (p\u00b2)^2. So then Q is the square of a prime squared. So in that case, the square of a prime number (but the prime here would be p squared? Wait, no. Wait, p is prime. So p^4 is (p\u00b2)^2, but p\u00b2 is not prime unless p is 2, but even then 2 squared is 4 which isn't prime. So maybe statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, so the first thought was that Q is p^4, so the fourth power of a prime, which would make statement II correct. \n\nSo in that case, statement II would have to be true. But let's check the other options. \n\nStatement I says Q is the square of a prime. But if Q is p^4, then it's (p\u00b2) squared, but p\u00b2 is not a prime. So that's not the case. So statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, but maybe I'm missing something. Wait, suppose Q was p^4, then Q is indeed a square, because 4 is even. So Q is a square of p squared. But the question is whether it's the square of a prime. Since p is a prime, then p squared is not a prime, so that would not satisfy statement I. Therefore statement I is not necessarily true. \n\nHmm, so then statement II is correct. But wait, let me think again. Are there any other possibilities where Q could have 5 factors besides being a prime to the fourth power? \n\nAnother way to get 5 factors would be if the number is the product of two different primes raised to certain exponents? Let's see. Suppose Q is p^1 * q^1. Then the number of factors would be (1+1)(1+1)=4. Not 5. If it was p^2 * q^1, then (2+1)(1+1)=6. Still not 5. So no, that can't be. So the only way is that the number is a single prime raised to the 4th power. \n\nTherefore, the correct statements are II. But then looking at the options, option C is \"II only\". But wait, let me check the statements again. \n\nWait the options given are: \n\nA)I only\n\nB)III only\n\nC)II only\n\nD)I and II only\n\nE)I and III only\n\nSo if II must be true, then the answer would be C. But wait, let me check the other statements again. \n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. If Q is p^4, then it's not the product of two primes unless p is multiplied four times. Like p^4 is p*p*p*p, which is four primes multiplied, but not two distinct primes. So statement III is not true. \n\nSo only statement II must be true. So the answer would be option C. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The problem says Q has 5 factors. Let me take an example. Let's pick a prime number, say 2. Then 2^4 is 16. What are the factors of 16? 1,2,4,8,16. That's five factors. So that works. Another example: 3^4 is 81. Its factors are 1,3,9,27,81. Five factors. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. So Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So II is correct. \n\nStatement I says it's the square of a prime. For instance, 2^2 is 4, which has factors 1,2,4. Three factors. Not five. So that's not. \n\nStatement III: product of two primes. For example, 6 is 2\u00d73. Its factors are 1,2,3,6. Four factors. Not five. So that's not. \n\nAlternatively, if the product is of two different primes each to the first power, that gives four factors. If it's the product of a prime squared and another prime, like 12 = 2\u00b2\u00d73, factors are (2+1)(1+1)=6 factors. \n\nSo none of the other options hold. So only II is correct, so the answer is C. \n\nWait, but wait. Wait the options include C as II only. But hold on, maybe I missed another possibility. Let me see. \n\nIs there any other number structure that can give five factors? For instance, if the number is a cube? Like p^3 would have 4 factors, so that's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a fifth power? No, then factors would be 6. \n\nHmm. So the only way to have exactly five factors is when the exponent plus one is 5, so exponent is 4. So the number must be a prime to the fourth power. \n\nTherefore II is correct. \n\nSo the answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are A to E. The question is, which must be true? \n\nWait, but wait, maybe there's a case where Q is the product of two different primes but in some other exponents? Like maybe p^4 is the only way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering that the number must be a single prime to the fourth. Let me think again. The number of factors is (exponents +1 multiplied). Since 5 is prime, the only possible way is that it's a single exponent of 4. So yeah. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. So the answer letter is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the statements again. \n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime. But Q is p^4, which is (p\u00b2)^2. So technically, it is a square of a composite number (since p is prime, p squared is composite). So the square of a prime would be (prime)^2, but that's only p squared, which has 3 factors. So the statement I is not true. \n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, exactly. \n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two primes. Well, the product of two primes would be p*q, but that gives four factors, so that's not. Alternatively, if it's product of two primes with exponents? Like p^1 * q^1, which gives four factors, so no. \n\nTherefore only II must be true, so answer C. \n\nHmm, but I recall sometimes problems where numbers like 36 have factors, but that's more. Wait, but in this case, the only way to get 5 factors is prime^4. So yeah, the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but wait the options given include C) II only. So that's correct. \n\nWait but I just thought of another possibility. Suppose Q is 1? But 1 has only one factor. So not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick? Like, the fourth power of a prime is also a square of a prime squared. But the square of a prime number (the prime itself squared) would be p squared, which is different. \n\nWait, statement I says \"the square of a prime number\". For example, if Q is (3^2)^2 = 81, then 81 is 3^4. The square of the prime 3 squared is (3^2)^2, but the base here is 3, a prime. Wait, but 3 squared is 9, which is not prime. Wait, the square of a prime number would be like (prime)^2. So if the prime is 3, then (3)^2 is 9, which has three factors. But Q in this case is 81, which is (9)^2, but 9 isn't prime. So the square of a prime number (the base has to be prime). So Q is not the square of a prime, but the square of a composite. So statement I is false. \n\nTherefore, yes, II is correct. So answer is C. \n\nHmm, but looking back at the options, I just want to make sure I didn't misread. Let me check the options again. \n\nOptions:\n\nA)I only\n\nB)III only\n\nC)II only\n\nD)I and II only\n\nE)I and III only\n\nYes, so C is the correct one. So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements must be true about a positive integer Q with exactly 5 factors, we analyze the number of factors formula. A number Q with prime factorization \\( Q = p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\cdots p_n^{a_n} \\) has \\( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\cdots (a_n + 1) \\) factors. Since 5 is prime, the only factorization is \\( 5 = 5 \\times 1 \\). This implies Q must be of the form \\( p^4 \\) (where \\( p \\) is a prime), as \\( (4 + 1) = 5 \\).\n\n**Statement I**: Q is the square of a prime number.  \nIf Q were \\( p^4 \\), it could be written as \\( (p^2)^2 \\). However, \\( p^2 \\) is not a prime (unless \\( p = 2 \\), but \\( 2^2 = 4 \\), which is composite). Thus, Q is not the square of a prime, so **Statement I is false**.\n\n**Statement II**: Q is the fourth power of a prime number.  \nThis directly matches the form \\( p^4 \\), so **Statement II is true**.\n\n**Statement III**: Q is the product of two prime numbers.  \nThe product of two distinct primes \\( p \\times q \\) has \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\) factors, not 5. Even if one prime is squared, \\( p^2 \\times q \\) would yield \\( (2+1)(1+1) = 6 \\) factors. Thus, **Statement III is false**.\n\nOnly **Statement II** must be true. \n\nAnswer: C",
