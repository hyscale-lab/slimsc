      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about Sachin's batting average in the IPL season. Let me read the question again carefully. \n\nThe problem states that currently, Sachin's batting average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, and then his batting average becomes 54. We have to find out the total number of matches he played in the season. The options are from A to E, with numbers like 6, 8, etc.\n\nHmm, batting average is calculated as total runs divided by the number of matches played, right? Or wait, actually, isn't batting average usually total runs divided by the number of dismissals (i.e., not outs)? But in many cases, especially in limited overs cricket like the IPL, players might bat in every match, and if they're not out, does that count towards the average? Wait, the question might be simplifying things here. Since the problem is presented as a math problem, maybe we can assume that the average is total runs divided by the number of matches played. Because otherwise, if it's dismissals, the problem might need more info. Let me proceed with the assumption that average = total runs / number of matches played. \n\nSo, let me denote variables. Let's let the number of matches he has played before the final be n. His current average is 51, so total runs before the final would be 51n. \n\nThen, in the final, he scores 78 runs. So after the final, his total runs would be 51n +78. The number of matches played becomes n +1. The new average is 54. \n\nTherefore, the equation is (51n +78)/(n +1) =54. \n\nNow, solving for n. Let's do that. \n\nMultiply both sides by (n+1): 51n +78 =54(n+1). \n\nExpanding the right side: 54n +54. \n\nNow, subtract 51n and 54 from both sides: \n\n78 -54 =54n -51n \n\n24 =3n \n\nSo n = 24/3 =8. \n\nWait, so n is the number of matches before the final, which is 8. Then total matches is n +1 =9. So the answer should be C)9. Let me check the options again. Option C is 9, which would be correct. \n\nWait, let me double-check the math. \n\nOriginal average:51 over n matches. After adding 78 runs and one more match, average is 54. \n\nEquation setup: \n\n(51n +78)/(n+1) =54 \n\nMultiply both sides: 51n +78 =54n +54 \n\nSubtract 51n and 54 from both sides: \n\n(78 -54) = 3n \n\n24 =3n \u2192 n=8. \n\nSo total matches is 8+1=9. That's correct. So the answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again. Suppose the average is calculated as total runs divided by the number of innings, but in some cases, if he didn't bat in a match, but in the IPL, each batsman probably bats in every match. So maybe the problem is straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that the final is part of the season, so the total matches is n+1, which would be 9, so answer C. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C)9.\n",
