      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so it's about partners joining a business at different times and their profit shares. The question is asking how many months after B joined did C join. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let me note down all the given information. A starts with Rs.40,000. Then B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000. C comes later with Rs.120,000. The total profit at the end of the year (which is 12 months) is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. We need to find the time difference between B and C joining. Wait, actually, the question says \"how many months after B joined the business did C join?\" So, the time between B's entry and C's entry is what we need to find.\n\nI remember that in partnership problems, the profit share is proportional to the product of the capital invested and the time period for which it was invested. So each partner's share is (Capital \u00d7 Time) divided by the sum of all (Capital \u00d7 Time) for all partners, multiplied by the total profit.\n\nLet me set up variables. Let me denote the time each partner was in the business. \n\nA was there for the entire year, so 12 months. B joined after 2 months, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait, no. Wait, if A started at month 0, then B joins after 2 months, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait, actually, the total time from the start is 12 months. So A's time is 12 months. B's time is (12 - 2) = 10 months. But C joined after some more time after B. Let me think again.\n\nLet me structure this properly. Let me assume that the total period is 12 months. Let me denote the time when C joined. Let me see. Let me let x be the number of months after B joined that C joined. Wait, the question says \"how many months after B joined did C join?\" So, the time between B's entry and C's entry is x months. Since B joined after 2 months, then C's entry would be 2 + x months after the start. Therefore, the time each partner contributed their capital would be as follows:\n\nA's time is 12 months.\n\nB's time is (12 - (2 + x - 2))? Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of when each joined. Let me try to rephrase:\n\n- A starts at the beginning (month 0) and stays for all 12 months. So his capital was invested for 12 months.\n\n- B joins after 2 months, so B's investment period is from month 2 to month 12, which is 10 months. Wait, but if the total time is 12 months, then B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months. \n\n- C joined after some more time after B. Let me say that C joined 't' months after A started. Then, since B joined at 2 months, the time between B and C would be (t - 2) months. But the question is asking for how many months after B joined did C join, which would be (t - 2). Alternatively, perhaps I should set it up differently. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote that C joined 'm' months after B. So, since B joined after 2 months from A's start, then C joined (2 + m) months after A started. Therefore, the time C was in the business would be (12 - (2 + m)) months. Wait, that's the time from when C joined until the end. So C's time is 12 - (2 + m) = 10 - m months? Wait, no. Wait, if C joined after (2 + m) months from the start, then the time C contributed is 12 - (2 + m) months. Hmm, so that would be correct. Let's see.\n\nLet me write down each partner's capital and time:\n\nA: Rs.40,000 for 12 months.\n\nB: Rs.60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months (since he joined after 2 months). Wait, but actually, if C joined m months after B, then B's time would still be 10 months only if C's joining time is after B but before the end. Wait, maybe I need to adjust B's time if C's entry affects that? No, B's time is fixed once he joined after 2 months. Wait, no. Wait, B's time is from month 2 to 12, so that's 10 months regardless of when C comes in. So B's time is fixed at 10 months. But C's time depends on when he joined. Let me think again.\n\nLet me define the variable properly. Let me let the time between B joining and C joining be 'x' months. So, since B joined after 2 months, then C joined 2 + x months after A started. So, the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, if C joined at 2 + x months into the year, then the remaining time until the end is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. So yes, that's correct. So C's time is (10 - x) months.\n\nWait, but the problem states that C's share is Rs.150,000. The total profit is 375,000. So C's share is 150,000. Let's set up the ratio.\n\nThe profit shares are proportional to (Capital * Time) for each partner. So the ratio of their shares should be equal to the ratio of (Capital * Time).\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA's capital-time: 40000 * 12\n\nB's capital-time: 60000 * 10 (since 10 months)\n\nC's capital-time: 120000 * (10 - x) [since his time is (10 -x) months]\n\nThe total ratio is (40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(10 -x)) \n\nBut the profit shares are divided according to these ratios. So C's share over total profit should equal C's ratio over total ratio.\n\nSo, (C's capital-time) / (Total capital-time) = C's profit / Total profit.\n\nSo,\n\n[120000*(10 - x)] / [ (40000*12) + (60000*10) + (120000*(10 -x)) ] = 150000 / 375000.\n\nSimplify the right side: 150000 / 375000 = 0.4, which is 2/5. \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n[120000*(10 - x)] / [Total] = 2/5.\n\nLet me compute the denominator (Total):\n\n40000*12 = 480,000\n\n60000*10 = 600,000\n\n120000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120,000x\n\nAdding all together: 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000; plus 1,200,000-120,000x gives total of 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x = 2,280,000 -120,000x\n\nSo the equation:\n\n[120000*(10 - x)] / (2,280,000 - 120,000x) = 2/5\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n120000*(10 -x) *5 = 2*(2,280,000 -120,000x)\n\nLet me compute left side: 120,000 *5*(10 -x) = 600,000*(10 -x)\n\nRight side: 2*(2,280,000 -120,000x) = 4,560,000 -240,000x\n\nSo equation:\n\n600,000*(10 -x) = 4,560,000 -240,000x\n\nLet me expand the left side: 6,000,000 -600,000x = 4,560,000 -240,000x\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n6,000,000 -600,000x -4,560,000 +240,000x =0\n\nCalculating constants: 6,000,000 -4,560,000 = 1,440,000\n\nVariables: (-600,000x +240,000x) = -360,000x\n\nSo equation becomes: 1,440,000 -360,000x =0\n\nThen, 360,000x = 1,440,000 \u2192 x = 1,440,000 / 360,000 = 4. \n\nSo x is 4 months. \n\nWait, so the time after B joined that C joined is 4 months. That would mean the answer is option B)4 months. Let me check the options. Option B is 4. \n\nWait, but let me verify this again. Let me plug back into the equation to confirm.\n\nIf x is 4, then C joined 4 months after B. Since B joined at 2 months, C joined at 6 months after A started. So C's time is 12 -6 = 6 months. \n\nCalculating each partner's capital-time:\n\nA:40,000 *12 =480,000\n\nB:60,000 *10=600,000\n\nC:120,000 *6=720,000\n\nTotal capital-time: 480k +600k +720k = 1,800,000?\n\nWait, wait, that can't be. Wait, 480+600 is 1080, plus 720 gives 1,800,000. \n\nC's share is 720,000 /1,800,000 = 0.4, which is 40%, and 40% of 375,000 is indeed 150,000. So that checks out. \n\nWait but in my earlier calculation when I set up the equation, I had 2,280,000 -120,000x as the total. Wait, when x is 4, then:\n\nTotal would be 2,280,000 - (120,000)(4) = 2,280,000 -480,000 = 1,800,000. So that matches. And the numerator is 120,000*(10-4)=120,000*6=720,000. So 720,000 /1,800,000 is 0.4. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B)4 months. Let me check the options again. The options are A)2, B)4, C)23, D)24, E)84. So B is correct. \n\nWait but let me think again. The problem states \"after some more time\" after B joined, so the time after B's entry is x=4. So the answer is 4 months, which is option B. So I think that's right. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here, so the answer must be B.\n",

Wait, when x is 4, then:\n\nTotal would be 2,280,000 - (120,000)(4) = 2,280,000 -480,000 = 1,800,000. So that matches. And the numerator is 120,000*(10-4)=120,000*6=720,000. So 720,000 /1,800,000 is 0.4. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B)4 months. Let me check the options again. The options are A)2, B)4, C)23, D)24, E)84. So B is correct. \n\nWait but let me think again. The problem states \"after some more time\" after B joined, so the time after B's entry is x=4. So the answer is 4 months, which is option B. So I think that's right. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here, so the answer must be B.\n\n\nTo determine how many months after B joined the business C joined, we use the concept of profit shares proportional to the product of capital and time invested. \n\n**Steps:**\n1. **Time Contributions:**\n   - **A** invested \u20b940,000 for **12 months** (entire year).\n   - **B** joined after 2 months, so invested \u20b960,000 for **10 months** (12 \u2013 2).\n   - Let **C** join **x months after B**.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem about partners in a business and their profit shares based on their investments and the time they were involved. Hmm, so the question is asking how many months after B joined did C join. The answer options are given, so I need to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for profit sharing in partnerships. I think it's based on the product of the capital invested and the time period each partner was in the business. So each partner's share is proportional to their capital multiplied by the number of months they were there. \n\nAlright, let's parse the problem again. A starts with Rs.40,000. B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000. Then C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000. The total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. We need to find how many months after B joined did C join. Wait, the wording is a bit tricky here. The question says \"how many months after B joined the business did C join?\" So B joined after 2 months from the start, so the time between B and C's entry is what we need. Let's note down the variables.\n\nLet me structure this:\n\n- A's investment: 40,000 for the entire year (12 months)\n- B's investment: 60,000, but started after 2 months. So B was there for (12 - 2) = 10 months? Wait, no. Wait, the total time is a year, so if B joined after 2 months, then B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months. \n\nThen C joined after some more time. Let's denote the time after B joined when C joined as 'x' months. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me define variables properly. \n\nLet me let the time between when B joined and when C joined be 't' months. But maybe a better approach is to set variables for C's duration. Let me try again.\n\nLet me define the time when C joined. Let's say that C joined 'm' months after A started the business. Since B joined after 2 months, then the time between B and C's joining would be (m - 2) months. Wait, but the question asks how many months after B joined did C join, so that would be (m - 2). So we need to find (m - 2). \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to let the time between when B joined and when C joined be 'x' months. So, since B joined after 2 months, C would have joined 2 + x months after A started. Then C's time in the business would be (12 - (2 + x)) = (10 - x) months? Wait, no. Let me think again. \n\nWait the total duration is 12 months. Let me think in terms of each partner's time:\n\n- A is there for all 12 months.\n- B starts after 2 months, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months.\n- C starts after some time after B. Let's say that between B's entry and C's entry, there's 'x' months. So C started (2 + x) months after A. Therefore, C's time in the business would be 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x months. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for x, which is the time after B joined when C joined. So if x is the number of months after B's entry, then C's time in the business is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. \n\nThe profit shares are proportional to their capital multiplied by their time. So the ratio of their investments multiplied by time will determine their shares. \n\nTotal profit is 375,000. C's share is 150,000, which is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, so 40% of the total profit. So C's share is 40%. \n\nLet me set up the ratio equations. Let me denote the ratio of their capitals multiplied by time as A : B : C. \n\nA's capital-time is 40000 * 12 = 480,000.\n\nB's is 60000 * 10 = 600,000 (since 10 months).\n\nWait, no, wait. Wait B's time is 10 months only if C didn't affect that? Wait, no. Wait, actually, no. Wait, B's time is 10 months only if C's joining time doesn't affect B's duration. Wait, B is there from month 3 (since 2 months after A started) until the end, so yes, 10 months. Wait, but if C joined later, B is still there for the entire time from when they joined until the end. So B's time is fixed at 10 months. \n\nWait, but C's time is variable. Let me correct. Let me use variables properly. Let me think again.\n\nLet me let the time when C joined be 't' months after A started. Then C's time in the business is (12 - t) months. \n\nThe time between B and C's joining would be (t - 2) months, since B joined at 2 months. But the question asks how many months after B joined did C join. So that would be (t - 2). So the answer is (t - 2). \n\nSo the variables are:\n\nA: invested 40000 for 12 months.\n\nB: invested 60000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months.\n\nC: invested 120000 for (12 - t) months, where t is the time after A started when C joined. \n\nThe ratio of their profits is (A's capital*time) : (B's) : (C's) \n\nSo the total ratio is (40000\u00d712) : (60000\u00d710) : (120000\u00d7(12 - t)) \n\nThe total profit is divided according to these ratios. \n\nC's share is (120000*(12 - t)) / [40000\u00d712 + 60000\u00d710 + 120000\u00d7(12 - t)] multiplied by total profit equals 150,000.\n\nLet me write equations. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst, compute each partner's capital*time:\n\nA: 40,000 *12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60,000 *10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120,000*(12 - t) \n\nTotal = 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000*(12 - t) \n\nC's share ratio is [120,000*(12 - t)] / total = (150,000 / 375,000) \n\nBecause 150k is C's share out of 375k total. \n\nSo, \n\n[120000*(12 - t)] / [480000 + 600000 + 120000*(12 - t)] = 150000 / 375000 \n\nSimplify the right side: 150,000 divided by 375,000 is 0.4. \n\nSo equation: \n\n[120000*(12 - t)] / [1,080,000 + 120,000*(12 - t)] = 0.4 \n\nWait, let me compute the denominator's first two terms: 480,000 + 600,000 = 1,080,000. \n\nLet me denote D = 12 - t. Then:\n\nNumerator: 120000D \n\nDenominator: 1,080,000 + 120000D \n\nSo equation:\n\n(120000D)/(1,080,000 + 120000D) = 0.4 \n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120000D = 0.4*(1,080,000 + 120000D)\n\nLet me compute the right side:\n\n0.4*1,080,000 = 432,000 \n\n0.4*120,000D = 48,000D \n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n120,000D = 432,000 + 48,000D \n\nSubtract 48,000D from both sides:\n\n72,000D = 432,000 \n\nThen D = 432,000 /72,000 = 6. \n\nSo D is 6. But D is 12 - t, so:\n\n12 - t = 6 \u2192 t = 6 \n\nWait, t is the time after A started when C joined. So C joined at 6 months after A started. \n\nBut B joined at 2 months after A started. Therefore, the time between B and C's joining is t - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4 months. \n\nSo the answer is 4 months, which is option B. \n\nWait, let me check my steps again. \n\nWait, let me confirm the calculation. \n\nSo D = 6, so 12 - t =6 \u2192 t=6. So C joined at 6 months after A started. Since B joined at 2 months after A, the difference between 6 and 2 is 4 months. So yes, 4 months after B joined. \n\nLet me check the ratio again. \n\nA's capital-time: 40k *12 = 480k\n\nB's:60k*10=600k\n\nC's:120k *6 (since 12 -6 =6 months) \u2192 720k \n\nTotal is 480 +600 +720 = 1,800,000 \n\nC's share is 720k /1,800k = 0.4, which is 40%. So 40% of 375k is 150k. That's correct. \n\nSo the answer is B)4 months. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A)2, B)4, C)23, D)24, E)84. So B is the correct option. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again about the time for C. If C joined 6 months after A started, then the time from the start is 6 months, so the duration they stayed is 12-6=6 months. So that's correct. \n\nSo all steps check out. The answer is B.\n",

This implies C's share is \\( \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = 0.4 \\) (40% of total profit).\n\n**Setting Up the Equation:**\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times D}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times D} = 0.4\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( D = 12 - t \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000(12 - t)}{1,080,000 + 120,000(12 - t)} = 0.4\n\\]\nSolving:\n\\[\n120,000(12 - t) = 0.4 \\times [1,080,000 + 120,000(12 - t)]\n\\]\n\\[\n120,000D = 432,000 + 48,000D \\quad \\text{(where } D = 12 - t\\text{)}\n\\]\n\\[\n72,000D = 432,000 \\implies D = 6\n\\]\nThus, \\( 12 - t = 6 \\implies t = 6 \\). Since C joined 6 months after A, the time between B (who joined at 2 months) and C is \\( 6 - 2 = 4 \\) months.\n\n**Verification:**\n- A's contribution: \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\)\n- B's contribution: \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\)\n- C's contribution: \\( 120,000 \\times 6 = 720,000 \\)\n- Total = \\( 480,000 + 600,000 + 720,000 = 1,800,000 \\)\n- C's share: \\( \\frac{720,000}{1,800,000} = 0.4 \\), confirming the 40% share.\n\nThe correct answer is **B) 4 months**.\n\nAnswer: B",
