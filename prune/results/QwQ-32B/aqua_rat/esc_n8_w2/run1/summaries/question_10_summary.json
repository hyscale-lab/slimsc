      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about a salesperson who gets a 10% commission on each sale. The question is asking how many $250 sales he needs to make to reach a salary of at least $1000. Hmm, wait, the term \"salary\" here might be a bit confusing. I think in this context, the salary refers to the total earnings from commissions, right? Because usually a salary is a fixed amount, but since he's getting commission, maybe they mean his total commission earnings need to be at least $1000. Let me make sure I understand that correctly.\n\nSo, each sale is $250, and he gets 10% of that as commission. So per sale, his commission is 10% of 250. Let me calculate that first. 10% of 250 is 0.10 * 250, which is $25. So each sale gives him $25.\n\nHe wants his total commission to be at least $1000. So we need to find the number of sales, let's call it 'n', such that 25 times n is greater than or equal to 1000. The equation would be 25n \u2265 1000. To find n, divide both sides by 25. 1000 divided by 25 is... let me do the division. 25 times 40 is 1000. So 1000 divided by 25 is 40. Wait, so n must be at least 40. But looking at the options, D is 40. But wait, hold on a second. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go through each step again. The commission per sale is 10% of 250, which is indeed 25. So each sale gives him $25. To reach at least $1000, the total commission must be \u22651000. So 25n \u22651000. Solving for n gives n \u2265 1000/25 =40. So he needs to make 40 sales. So the answer would be D)40?\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52. So D is an option. But maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, does the question say \"salary of at least $1000\"? Maybe the term \"salary\" here refers to a base salary plus commission? Because sometimes people have a base salary plus commission. The problem didn't mention a base salary, though. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?\" Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. The term \"salary\" here might actually mean his total earnings, which in this case is purely commission. Since the problem doesn't mention a base salary, I think the question is considering his commission as his salary here. So the calculation I did earlier is correct. Then 40 sales would give exactly $1000. Since the question says \"at least $1000,\" then 40 is the minimum number. So the answer is D. But let me check the options again. The options include D as 40, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here. Let me think again. Suppose the problem is interpreted as the salesperson's total earnings (if he has a base salary plus commission), but since the problem didn't mention a base, I think that's not the case. The problem states he gets a 10% commission on each sale, so that's his only income here. Therefore, the total commission must be at least 1000. So 25*n \u22651000 \u2192 n\u226540. So 40 sales would give exactly 1000. Since the question says \"at least,\" 40 is the minimum needed. So the answer is D)40. Let me check the options again. The options are A through E, with D being 40. So that's the correct answer. I don't see any other possible way to interpret this.\n",

The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. The question says, \"a salary of at least $1000.\" Since it's phrased that way, maybe the entire salary comes from commission? Because sometimes sales jobs have base plus commission, but the problem doesn't mention a base. The problem states he gets a 10% commission on each sale. So perhaps his total earnings are just the commission. So, we need his total commission to be at least $1000.\n\nSo each sale is $250, and he gets 10% of that. Let me calculate the commission per sale. 10% of 250 is 0.10 * 250 = $25 per sale. So each sale gives him $25. \n\nNow, how many of those $25 do you need to add up to at least $1000? Let me call the number of sales 'n'. So, 25 * n \u2265 1000. To find the minimum n, we can divide 1000 by 25. 1000 divided by 25 is 40. So 40 sales would give exactly 1000.

So the answer should be D. But let me check the options again. Option D is 40, so that's correct. \n\nBut hold on, maybe there's a trick here. Like, do the sales have to be whole numbers? Since you can't make a fraction of a sale. So if the calculation had been 39.5, you would need to round up to 40. But in this case, 40 is exact. So the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem states: \"how many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?\" So yes, the total commission must be \u22651000.

Let me check the other options to see if any could be traps. Like, if someone thought 10% of 250 is 25, and then maybe thought 1000 divided by 250 is 4, but that would be wrong. Or maybe someone miscalculates 10% of 250 as 25, then 1000 divided by 25 is 40. So yeah, D is correct. The other options: 25 would give 25*25=625, which is way below. 40 is the right one.
