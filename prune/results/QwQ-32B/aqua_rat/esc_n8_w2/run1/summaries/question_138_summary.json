      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Ram and Krishna are starting from points A and B at the same time and moving towards each other. Their speeds are 20 m/s and 40 m/s respectively. They meet at point C after 10 seconds. I need to find the total distance between A and B. Hmm, let's think.\n\nFirst, when two people are moving towards each other, their relative speed adds up, right? So the combined speed is 20 + 40 = 60 m/s. Since they started at the same time and met after 10 seconds, the total distance between A and B should be the distance they covered together in those 10 seconds. \n\nWait, yes. Because the time taken until they meet is the time it takes for the sum of their distances to equal the initial distance between A and B. So the formula would be: total distance = (speed of Ram + speed of Krishna) \u00d7 time until meeting. \n\nSo plugging in the numbers: 60 m/s multiplied by 10 seconds. Let me calculate that. 60 times 10 is 600. Oh wait, but looking at the options, 600 is option E. But wait, let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate each of their distances separately and add them. Let's see. Ram's distance is speed \u00d7 time, so 20 m/s *10s = 200 meters. Krishna's distance is 40*10=400 meters. Adding those gives 200 +400 =600. So that's 600 meters. So the answer must be E)600 meters. But wait the options have A as 700, which is different. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait the problem says they start at the same time towards each other. So yes, their combined speed is 60, time 10, so total distance is 600. Hmm. Let me check the options again. The options are A)700, B)1000, C)700 km (which is way too big), D)555, E)600. So E is there. So the correct answer should be E. \n\nWait but maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The question says they start at the same time and travel towards each other. So when they meet at point C after 10 seconds, the sum of the distances they've each traveled is the total distance between A and B. So yeah, that's exactly right. So 20*10 +40*10=600. So answer E. So why is option A 700? Maybe a trick? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in units? The speeds are in m/s and time is seconds, so the answer is in meters. 60*10 is 600 meters. So yes, E is correct. I think that's the right answer.\n",

They meet at point C after 10 seconds. The question is asking for the total distance between A and B. Hmm, let me think.\n\nAlright, so when two people are moving towards each other, their relative speed adds up. Like, the combined speed at which they're approaching each other is the sum of their individual speeds. Right? So Ram is going at 20 m/s and Krishna at 40 m/s. Adding those together gives 60 m/s. \n\nNow, they meet after 10 seconds. So the total distance between A and B must be the distance they covered together in those 10 seconds. Because when they meet, they would have covered the entire distance between A and B between them. \n\nLet me write that out. The formula would be total distance = (speed of Ram + speed of Krishna) multiplied by time until meeting. \n\nSo, that's (20 + 40) * 10. Let me calculate that. 20 plus 40 is 60. 60 times 10 is 600.

So the total distance should be 60*10 = 600. \n\nHmm, perhaps the options are trying to trick me into adding speeds wrong? Like maybe thinking they are moving in the same direction? But no, the problem says they are moving towards each other. So their relative speed is additive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a unit mistake? The speeds are in m/s and time is in seconds, so the units should be meters. 20 m/s times 10 seconds is 200 meters for Ram, and 40 *10 is 400 for Krishna. 200+400 is 600. Yeah, that checks out. \n\nSo the answer must be E)600 meters. So why is option A 700 there? Maybe a common mistake if someone miscalculates. But according to my calculations, it's 600.
