      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability question here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election. The chance that a single voter voted is 90%, right? Hmm, so this sounds like a binomial probability problem. \n\nRight, binomial because each trial (voter) has two outcomes: voted or didn't vote. The probability of success (voting) is 90%, which is 0.9. We need exactly four successes out of five trials. The formula for binomial probability is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). \n\nLet me plug in the numbers here. The number of trials n is 5, the number of successes k is 4. So first, I need to calculate the combination C(5,4). The combination formula is n!/(k!(n-k)!), so 5!/(4!1!) which is (5*4*3*2*1)/( (4*3*2*1)*(1) ) = 5. Okay, so that part is 5.\n\nThen p^k is 0.9^4. Let me compute that. 0.9^4. Let's see, 0.9 squared is 0.81, then squared again would be 0.81 * 0.81. Wait, no, that's for 0.9^4. Alternatively, 0.9 * 0.9 is 0.81, then multiply by 0.9 again gives 0.729, then times another 0.9 is 0.6561. Wait, let me check again: 0.9^1 is 0.9, 0.9^2 is 0.81, 0.9^3 is 0.729, 0.9^4 is 0.6561. Yes, that's right. So 0.9^4 is 0.6561.\n\nThen the (1-p)^(n-k) part. Since n is 5 and k is 4, that's (1-0.9)^(1) which is 0.1^1, so 0.1. \n\nPutting it all together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let me calculate that. 0.6561 multiplied by 0.1 is 0.06561. Multiply by 5: 0.06561 *5. Let me see, 0.06561 times 5. 0.06*5 is 0.3, 0.00561*5 is 0.02805, so total is 0.32805. So that's approximately 32.8%. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 32.8%, so that must be the answer. Wait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nCombination: C(5,4) is definitely 5. The exponents: 4 successes, so 0.9^4, and 1 failure, 0.1^1. Multiplying all together: yes, 5 *0.6561 *0.1. Let me recalculate the multiplication step again. 5 *0.6561 is 3.2805. Then multiply by 0.1 gives 0.32805, which is 32.805%, so approximately 32.8%. So option B. \n\nHmm, the options have B as 32.8, so that's correct. I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes here. Maybe I should check if I mixed up the exponents. Let's see, exactly four voted, so one didn't. So the probability for the one who didn't is 0.1, and the four who did is 0.9 each. Yeah, that's right. So the calculation is correct. So the answer should be B.\n",

If five registered voters are chosen at random, what's the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted? The options are from A to E. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nAlright, first, this sounds like a binomial probability problem. Because each voter is an independent trial with two outcomes: voted or didn't vote. The probability of success (voted) is 90%, so 0.9, and failure (didn't vote) is 10%, 0.1. We're looking for exactly four successes out of five trials. \n\nThe formula for binomial probability is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Let me recall, C(n,k) is the combination of n things taken k at a time. So here, n is 5, k is 4. \n\nLet me plug in the numbers. So first calculate C(5,4). The combination formula is n!/(k!(n-k)!). So 5!/(4!1!) = (5\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71)/( (4\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71)(1) ) ) = 5/1 =5. Right, so C(5,4) is 5.\n\nThen p^k is (0.9)^4. Let me compute that. 0.9^4. Let me see, 0.9 squared is 0.81. Then squared again (since 0.9^4 is (0.9^2)^2). So 0.81 squared is 0.6561. Wait, 0.81 *0.81. Let me check: 0.8*0.8 =0.64, 0.8*0.01=0.008, etc. Wait, maybe better to compute 81*81 and then adjust the decimal. 81*81 is 6561, so moving the decimal four places (since each 0.81 has two decimal places, so 0.81*0.81 is 0.6561). So that's 0.6561.\n\nThen (1-p)^(n-k) is (0.1)^(5-4) =0.1^1 =0.1.\n\nSo putting it all together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let me compute that. 0.6561 *0.1 is 0.06561. Multiply by 5: 0.06561 *5. Let's see, 0.06 *5 is 0.3, 0.00561*5 is 0.02805. So adding them gives 0.32805. So that's approximately 32.8%. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 32.8%, so that must be the answer. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nFirst, combination part: 5 choose 4 is definitely 5. Then 0.9^4: yes, 0.9*0.9=0.81, times 0.9 again is 0.729, times another 0.9 gives 0.6561. That's correct. Then (0.1)^1 is 0.1. Multiplying all together: 5 * 0.6561 *0.1. The 0.6561 *0.1 is 0.06561, then times 5 is 0.32805. Yes, so 32.805%, which rounds to 32.8%, exactly option B. \n\nHmm, but wait, just to be thorough, maybe I made a mistake in the exponents? Let me check the formula again. The formula is n choose k multiplied by p^k multiplied by (1-p)^(n\u2212k). Here, n=5, k=4. So (1-p) is 0.1, and the exponent is 5-4=1, so yes, that's right. So the calculation seems correct. \n\nAnother way to think: The probability of exactly four voting would be the number of ways to have four voters and one non-voter. Each such case has probability (0.9)^4*(0.1)^1. The number of such cases is 5 (since any one of the five could be the non-voter). So 5 * (0.9)^4*(0.1). Which is exactly what I did. \n\nTherefore I think the correct answer is B, 32.8%.\n",
