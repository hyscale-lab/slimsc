      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so all 250 files are infected by a virus, a worm, or both. The question is asking how many files were not infected by a worm. \n\nFirst, I need to recall some set theory here. Let me think of the viruses and worms as two overlapping sets. The total number of files is the union of virus and worm infections. The formula for the union of two sets is:\n\nTotal = Virus + Worm - Both + Neither.\n\nWait, but the problem says all files are infected by either a virus or worm or both. So that means Neither is zero. So, Virus + Worm - Both = 250. \n\nThe problem states that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. Let me parse that. \"Infected only by a worm\" would be the worm set minus the overlap. So, Worm only = 2.5 * Both. Let me write variables to make this clearer.\n\nLet me denote:\nLet V be the number of files infected by a virus (including those also infected by worms).\nLet W be the number infected by a worm (including both).\nLet B be the number infected by both.\n\nThen, the number infected only by a worm is W - B. According to the problem, that's 2.5 times B. So:\n\nW - B = 2.5 * B \u2192 W - B = 2.5B \u2192 W = 3.5B. \n\nAlso, the total is V + W - B = 250. Since all files are in at least one set.\n\nAnother piece of information: 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, so 50% of 250 is 125 files not infected by a virus. But since all files are infected by at least one, those 125 must be infected only by worms. Because if they weren't in the virus set, they must be in the worm set only. \n\nWait, let me think again. The total number not infected by a virus would be the number in only worms plus those in neither, but since there are no neither, it's just W - B. Wait, yes! Because the \"not infected by a virus\" would be exactly the worm-only files. \n\nSo according to that, W - B = 125 (since 50% of 250 is 125). But earlier, the problem says that W - B is 2.5 times B. So substituting:\n\n2.5B = 125 \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 \u2192 Let's calculate that. 2.5 times 50 is 125, so B is 50. \n\nSo B =50. Then, since W = 3.5B (from earlier, because W = 3.5B?), Wait let's check that again. \n\nWait the first equation was W - B = 2.5B \u2192 W = 3.5B. So if B is 50, then W is 3.5 *50=175. \n\nNow, total is V + W - B =250. So plug in W as 175 and B as 50:\n\nV + 175 -50 = 250 \u2192 V +125 =250 \u2192 V =125. \n\nSo the number of files infected by virus is 125. \n\nThe question is asking how many were NOT infected by a worm. So that's the number of files only infected by virus plus those not in either. But since all are in at least one, it's just the virus-only files. \n\nVirus-only is V - B \u2192 125 -50 =75. \n\nWait, so the answer would be 75, which is option C. \n\nLet me double-check. Let me recap:\n\nTotal files:250.\n\nWorm only: W - B =175-50=125 (which matches the 50% not infected by virus, so that's correct).\n\nBoth:50.\n\nVirus only: V - B =125-50=75.\n\nSo total files: 75 (virus only) +125 (worm only) +50 (both) = 250. Perfect, that adds up. \n\nTherefore, the number not infected by a worm is the virus only, which is75. So answer C.\n",

The question is asking how many files were not infected by a worm. Wait, so those would be the files infected only by a virus, right? Because if a file isn't infected by a worm, it must be only by a virus since all are infected by one or the other.\n\nThe problem states that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. Let me note that down. Let me denote some variables to make this clearer. Let me think: Let V be the set of files with a virus, W the set with a worm. The total is 250, so |V \u222a W| =250. Since all are in at least one, union is 250.\n\nWe need to find the number not infected by a worm. That would be the files only in V but not in W, which is |V - W|. \n\nThe problem says the number of files infected only by a worm (so W but not V) is 2.5 times those infected by both. Let me let B be the number infected by both. Then, the only worm (W only) is 2.5B. \n\nAlso, it says 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% of 250 is 125. So the number not infected by a virus is 125. But those not infected by a virus must be the ones only infected by worms, right? Because if they're not in V, they must be in W only. Wait yes! Because all files are in at least one. So the number not infected by virus is exactly the number of W only. \n\nWait, that's an important point. Because \"not infected by a virus\" would mean they are only in W. So according to that, the number of W only is 125. But the problem also states that the W only is 2.5 times the both. Let me write that equation.\n\nSo W only = 2.5 * both. But also, W only is 125. So 2.5 * B = 125 \u2192 B = 125 / 2.5 = 50. So both are 50. \n\nNow, let's get the total numbers. The total files are the sum of V only, W only, and both. Wait, actually, the formula is |V \u222a W| = |V| + |W| - |V \u2229 W|. But maybe breaking it into parts is easier here.\n\nAlternatively, the total is (V only) + (W only) + both = 250. Wait no, that's not right. Because V only plus both is |V|, and W only plus both is |W|. So the total is (V only + both) + (W only) - but no, the correct way is V only + W only + both would be overcounting. Wait no, actually the correct total is V only + W only + both? Wait no, no. Wait, V only is those in V but not W. W only is those in W but not V. Both are in both. So adding those three gives the total. Wait yes, because V only + both = all in V, and W only + both = all in W, but when you add V only + W only + both, that's correct because the both category is added once. So total is indeed V_only + W_only + both = 250.\n\nBut let's see: Let me think of variables. Let me denote:\n\nLet B = both.\n\nThen W only is 2.5B.\n\nWe also know that the number not infected by virus is 125. Since not infected by virus means they are in W only, so W only =125. Therefore 2.5B =125 \u2192 B=50. So both are 50. \n\nNow, the total files are 250 = (V only) + (W only) + B. We need to find V only, because that's the number not infected by a worm. \n\nSo substituting in the numbers: V only + 125 (W only) +50 (both) =250. So V only = 250 -125-50 = 75. Wait, so the answer would be 75? Which is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check another way. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula with sets.\n\nThe number not infected by virus is 125, which is the complement of V. So the total is 250, so |V| is 250 -125 = 125. Because |V| is the number infected by virus (either only or both). \n\nSo |V| = 125. But |V| is equal to (V only) + B. \n\nWe know B is 50, so V only = 125 -50 =75.
