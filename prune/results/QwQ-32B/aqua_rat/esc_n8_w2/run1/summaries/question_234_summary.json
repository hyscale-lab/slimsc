      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where a professor borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university received Rs. 300 in interest. The question is asking for the rate of interest per annum. The options are A) 2%, B)8%, C)5%, D)10%, and E) None of these. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that simple interest is calculated using the formula I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest per period, and T is the time in years. So in this case, the interest (I) is Rs. 300, the principal (P) is Rs. 5000, and the time (T) is 3 years. We need to find R.\n\nLet me plug the numbers into the formula. The formula rearranged to solve for R would be R = I / (P * T). Plugging in the numbers: R = 300 / (5000 * 3). Let me calculate the denominator first: 5000 multiplied by 3 is 15,000. Then, 300 divided by 15,000. Hmm, 300 divided by 15,000... Let's see, 15,000 divided by 100 is 150, so 300 is 2 times that. Wait, maybe another way. 300 divided by 15,000 equals 0.02. Because 15,000 times 0.02 is 300. So 0.02 as a percentage would be 2%. \n\nWait, but let me check that again. Because 2% of 5000 is 100 per year. So over 3 years, that would be 300. Exactly. Because 5000 * 0.02 = 100 per year. 100 * 3 is 300. So that matches the interest given. So the rate must be 2%, which is option A. \n\nBut hold on, the options include A as 2%, so that's the answer. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate. \n\nInterest is 300. So R = (300) / (5000 * 3) = 300/(15000) = 0.02. Yes, so 0.02 is 2%. So that's correct. So the answer should be A) 2%. \n\nLooking at the options again, the first option is 2%, so that's the one. Therefore, the correct answer is A. I don't see any errors here. The calculation seems straightforward. Maybe some might think it's 5% but that would give higher interest. Let me check with 5%: 5000 * 0.05 = 250 per year. 250*3=750, which is way more than 300. So no. So 2% is correct. Therefore, the answer is A.\n",
