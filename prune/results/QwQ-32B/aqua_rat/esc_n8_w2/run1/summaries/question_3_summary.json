      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that if a number is divisible by two numbers, like 9 and 12, then it must be divisible by their least common multiple (LCM). So maybe I should find the LCM of 9 and 12 first. Let me think, what's the LCM of those?\n\nBreaking them down into prime factors: 9 is 3 squared (3\u00d73), and 12 is 2 squared times 3 (2\u00d72\u00d73). The LCM would take the highest power of each prime number present. So that's 2\u00b2, 3\u00b2. Multiplying those together gives 4\u00d79=36. So the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. \n\nThat means X has to be a multiple of 36. So the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. Wait, but the options are numbers like 36, 15, etc. Wait, the question says \"the multiple of X\" so the correct answer must be a number that X divides into, or is X a divisor of that number?\n\nWait, the wording is a bit confusing. Let me read the question again. \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Oh, maybe the phrasing is that X is divisible by 9 and 12, so X must be a multiple of both, so X must be a multiple of 36. Then the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. Wait, but if X is any multiple of 36, like 36, 72, etc., then the options given are numbers like 36, 15, etc. So the only one that could be a multiple of X (which is at least 36) is 36 itself. Because if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36 divided by 36 is 1, which is an integer). But for higher X like 72, none of the options would be multiples. But since the question is phrased as \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12\", perhaps X is the LCM, so 36. Therefore the answer would be option A, 36.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The question states \"the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12\". Wait, perhaps the question is phrased such that X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12. So X must be a multiple of 36. Then, the question is which of the options is a multiple of X. Wait, but since X could be any multiple of 36 (like 36, 72, etc.), the only possible option that is a multiple of X (regardless of X's value) would have to be a number that is a multiple of all possible X's. But that can't be, because X could be 36, so the number must be a multiple of 36. So among the options, only 36 is a multiple of X when X is 36, but if X is 72, then 36 wouldn't be a multiple of X. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe the question is intended to say that X is the least common multiple, so the minimal such number. Then, the answer would be 36. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by 9 and 12. Wait, maybe I should rephrase the question. The problem says: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" So \"it\" refers to X? Like, \"if X is divisible by 9 and 12, then which of the following is a multiple of X?\" \n\nHmm, that would make sense. So X must be divisible by both 9 and 12, so X must be a multiple of LCM(9,12)=36. Therefore, X is 36, 72, 108, etc. Now, the question is which of the options is a multiple of X. Wait, but the options are numbers like 36, 15, etc. So for example, if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since 36/36 =1). So 36 would be a valid answer. But if X were 72, then none of the options would be multiples of X. However, the problem is asking for which of the options is a multiple of X when X is divisible by 9 and 12. Since X could be 36, then the only possible answer is 36 (option A), because that's the only one that's a multiple of X when X is 36. The other options like 15, 17, 5, or 7 are not multiples of 36. So the correct answer is A.\n",
