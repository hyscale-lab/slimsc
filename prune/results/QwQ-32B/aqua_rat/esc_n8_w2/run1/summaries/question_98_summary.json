      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how much each daughter gets when the man divides 8600 rupees among his sons, daughters, and nephews. The problem states that each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as a nephew. Hmm, so maybe I should start by assigning variables based on the nephew's share since the others are multiples of that.\n\nLet me denote the amount each nephew gets as N. Then each daughter would get 4N, and each son would get 5N. That makes sense. Now, how many of each are there? The problem says 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. \n\nSo the total amount given out would be the sum of all their shares. Let me write that out. \n\nTotal = (Number of sons \u00d7 son's share) + (Number of daughters \u00d7 daughter's share) + (Number of nephews \u00d7 nephew's share)\n\nPlugging in the numbers and variables: \n\nTotal = 5*(5N) + 4*(4N) + 2*(N)\n\nLet me compute that. 5 sons each getting 5N would be 25N. 4 daughters at 4N each would be 16N. The two nephews get 2N. Adding those together: 25N +16N is 41N, plus 2N makes 43N total. \n\nBut the total amount is 8600, so 43N = 8600. To find N, I can divide both sides by 43. Let me do that: 8600 divided by 43. Let me compute that. 43 times 200 is 8600, right? Because 43*200 = 8600. Oh wait, yes! So N is 200. \n\nWait, so each nephew gets 200. Then each daughter gets 4 times that, so 4*200 is 800. Hmm, but looking at the options, option E is 800. But wait, let me check again. Did I do the math right?\n\nLet me go through the steps again. \n\nEach son gets 5N, each daughter 4N, each nephew N.\n\nTotal is 5 sons *5N =25N\n\n4 daughters *4N =16N\n\n2 nephews *N =2N\n\nTotal:25+16+2 =43 parts. 43N =8600 \u2192 N=8600/43. Let me calculate that division again. 43 times 200 is 8600. So yes, 8600 divided by 43 is exactly 200. So N=200.\n\nThen each daughter gets 4*200=800. So the answer should be E) 800? But wait, the options given include E as 800. Hmm. But let me check the options again. The options are A)400, B)500, C)600, D)700, E)800. So E is there. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me double-check the problem statement again. \n\nThe man divides 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. Each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew. Each son gets five times as much as each nephew. So yes, that's exactly how I set it up. \n\nHmm, but maybe I miscalculated the total? Let me recalculate the coefficients. \n\n5 sons each get 5N: 5\u00d75 =25. 4 daughters \u00d74N is 16. 2\u00d71 is 2. So 25+16 is 41, plus 2 is 43. So that's correct. 43N=8600. N=200. \n\nSo daughter gets 4\u00d7200=800. So the answer should be E. But wait, the options don't have E as the first thought? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's numbers. Let me check again. \n\nWait the problem says 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews. Yes. Each daughter gets four times a nephew's share. Each son five times. So all right. \n\nHmm, but maybe I misread the question. Wait the problem says \"each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew\" \u2014 so daughter's share is 4 times nephew's. Son's is 5 times. So yes, the setup is correct. \n\nHmm, but why does the option E seem high? Let me see. Let me compute the total if each daughter gets 800. Then each nephew gets 200. \n\nSo each son gets 5\u00d7200=1000. \n\nCalculating total:\n\nSons:5\u00d71000 =5000\n\nDaughters:4\u00d7800 =3200\n\nNephews:2\u00d7200=400\n\nTotal is 5000+3200=8200, plus 400 is 8600. Exactly matches. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore the answer is E) 800. But wait, looking at the options again, the user listed E as 800. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, but why do I feel uncertain? Maybe because sometimes these problems have a trick. Let me check once more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking per daughter, so yes, the calculation is right. So I think the correct answer is E. \n\nWait, but the options given in the problem: the options are A to E, with E being 800. So the answer is E. But let me check if I misread the question. Wait the question says \"how much does each daughter receive?\" which is 4N, which is 800. So yes. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about dividing Rs 8600 among sons, daughters, and nephews. Hmm, the question is asking how much each daughter gets. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to set up variables for each group's share. Let me think. The problem says each daughter gets four times as much as each nephew, and each son gets five times as much as a nephew. Oh right, so maybe I can let the nephew's amount be a variable, like x. Then the daughter's would be 4x and the son's would be 5x. That makes sense because the daughters get four times the nephews, sons five times. \n\nSo let's define:\nLet the amount each nephew receives be x.\nThen each daughter gets 4x, and each son gets 5x.\n\nNow, how many of each are there? The man has 5 sons, 4 daughters, and 2 nephews. So total amount given to all of them should add up to 8600.\n\nLet me calculate each group's total. \n\nFor the sons: 5 sons each getting 5x, so total is 5 * 5x =25x.\n\nDaughters: 4 daughters each get 4x, so 4 *4x =16x.\n\nNephews: 2 nephews each get x, so 2x.\n\nAdding all those up: 25x +16x +2x = 43x. \n\nWait, the total is 43x, and that equals 8600. So solving for x would be 8600 divided by 43. Let me do that division. \n\nHmm, 43 times 200 is 8600, right? Because 43 * 200 = 8600. Oh, so x is 200. \n\nWait, so each nephew gets 200. Then each daughter gets 4x, which is 4*200 = 800? Wait but looking at the options, option E is 800. But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, let me recheck the equations. \n\nTotal from sons: 5 sons * 5x each =25x. Correct. Daughters: 4*4x=16x. Correct. Nephews 2x. So total 25+16+2=43x. Yes, 43x=8600. 8600 divided by 43 is 200. So x=200. Therefore each daughter gets 4x which is 800. That would be E. \n\nBut wait, the options include 800 as E, but I need to make sure that the question is phrased correctly. Let me read again. Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew. So yes, daughter is 4x, nephew x. So 4*200 is indeed 800. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A)400, B)500, C)600, D)700, E)800. So E is the answer here. Wait, but maybe I miscalculated something. Let me check the math again. \n\nTotal amount: 5 sons *5x =25x, 4 daughters *4x=16x, 2 nephews *x =2x. Sum:25+16 is 41, plus 2 is 43. 43x =8600. 8600 divided by 43. Let me do the division step again. \n\n43 times 200 is 8600. Because 43 * 200 = 43*2*100=86*100=8600. Exactly. So x is 200. So each daughter gets 4x which is 800. So the answer should be E. \n\nWait, but why is option C 600? Maybe I mixed up the ratios. Let me check the problem again. \n\nProblem says: each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew. So yes, the son's amount is 5x, daughter's 4x. So the setup was correct. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the number of sons, daughters, nephews? The question states 5 sons, 4 daughters, 2 nephews. Yes. \n\nSo 5*5x +4*4x +2*x =25x+16x+2x =43x. Correct. \n\nSo the answer must be E) Rs 800. But let me check if the options include that. Yes, E is 800. So that's the answer. Wait, but maybe I misread the question. Like, maybe the total is divided among all of them, so perhaps the question is in another way. Hmm, no, the problem says \"divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons,4 daughters and 2 nephews\". So the total is correct. \n\nHmm, maybe the question is a trick question? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again.

So the answer is E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the question says \"each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew\" \u2014 perhaps that's total for all daughters compared to total for nephews? Wait, no, the wording is each. Like per person. Because if it was total, the problem would probably say \"all daughters together receive four times as much as all nephews\". So the way it's phrased, it's per individual. So the setup is correct. \n\nHmm. So I think the answer is E. But maybe the options are different? Let me check again.
