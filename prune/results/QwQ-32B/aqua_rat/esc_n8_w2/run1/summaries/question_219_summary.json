      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about averages for passing and failing students, and I need to find the percentage that passed. Let's see. Hmm, the passing students averaged 83, and the failing ones 55. The overall average is 76. I think this is a weighted average problem. Like, the total points from all students divided by the number of students equals 76.\n\nRight, let me think of it in terms of variables. Let's say the number of passing students is P and failing is F. Then the total points would be 83P + 55F. The total number of students is P + F. The average is (83P +55F)/(P+F) =76. \n\nSo I need to solve for P/(P+F), which is the percentage that passed. Let me set up the equation. \n\n83P +55F =76(P + F). Let's expand the right side: 76P +76F. \n\nSubtract 76P and 76F from both sides to get: 83P -76P +55F -76F =0. That simplifies to 7P -21F =0. \n\nHmm, 7P =21F \u2192 P =3F. So the ratio of P to F is 3 to 1. \n\nWait, so total students would be P + F =3F + F=4F. So the percentage that passed is P/(4F) =3F/4F= 3/4, which is 75%? Wait but the options don't have 75% as the answer here? Wait, option E is 75%. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again. Maybe I made a mistake. \n\nStarting equation: (83P +55F)/(P + F) =76. Multiply both sides by (P+F):\n\n83P +55F =76P +76F. \n\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides: \n\n7P =21F \u2192 7P =21F \u2192 P =3F. \n\nSo P is 3 times F. So total students are 3F + F =4F. \n\nSo the passing percentage is (3F)/4F = 3/4, which is 75%. But the options have E as 75%, so that would be the answer. But wait, the options given include E)75%, so that's an option. Wait the options listed are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%.\n\nHmm, so maybe I did it right. But I thought maybe the answer was different. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I messed up the algebra. Let me check the equation again.\n\nOriginal equation after moving terms: 83P +55F =76(P + F). \n\n83P -76P = 76F -55F \u2192 7P =21F \u2192 yes, that's correct. 7P=21F \u2192 P=3F. \n\nSo the ratio is 3:1. So passing is 3/4, which is 75%, so E. But the options given have E as 75%. So the answer should be E?\n\nWait, but let me see another way. Maybe using alligation. The average is 76. The difference between passing and average: 83-76=7. The difference between average and failing:76-55=21. So the ratio of failing to passing is 7:21 =1:3. So passing is 3/(3+1)= 75%. Yep, same result. So the answer must be E. But wait, the options list E as 75% so that's correct. Hmm, but why is the option B 66%? Maybe I made a mistake in the ratio direction?\n\nWait, in alligation, the ratio is the distance opposite. So the ratio of the distances gives the ratio of the other group. Wait, let me recall alligation method.\n\nThe alligation method says that the ratio of the number of students in each group is the inverse of the differences. \n\nSo, the difference between the higher average and overall average is 83-76=7. The difference between the overall and the lower average is 76-55=21. So the ratio is 7:21, which simplifies to 1:3. \n\nThis ratio is the ratio of the number of students in the lower group to the higher group. So failing to passing is 7:21 \u2192 1:3. So passing is 3 parts, failing 1. Total 4 parts. So passing is 3/4, 75%. Yep, so that's correct. So the answer is E. \n\nHmm, but the options given include E as 75%, so that's the answer. Wait, but maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The passing average is 83, failing 55, overall 76. Yes. So all steps check out. So the answer is E)75%.\n",

The question is: the passing students had an average of 83, failing had 55, and the overall class average was 76. I need to find what percent passed. Hmm, right.\n\nAlright, let's think. I remember that when dealing with averages like this, it's probably a weighted average situation. Like, the overall average is between the two group averages. So maybe I can set up an equation where the total points from passing students plus the total from failing equals the overall total, then solve for the number of students in each group.\n\nLet me denote the number of passing students as P and failing as F. The total number of students would then be P + F. The total points for passing students would be 83P and for failing 55F. The overall average is (83P + 55F)/(P + F) = 76. \n\nSo the equation is (83P + 55F) = 76(P + F). Let me write that down properly. Expanding the right side gives 76P +76F. Then subtract 76P and 76F from both sides to get:\n\n83P -76P +55F -76F =0 \u2192 7P -21F=0. \n\nHmm, so 7P =21F \u2192 P = 3F. Wait, that's right. So the ratio of P to F is 3 to 1? Let me check the math again. Let's see:\n\nStarting equation: 83P +55F =76(P +F)\n\nSubtract 76P and 76F from both sides:\n\n(83P -76P) + (55F -76F) =0 \u2192 7P -21F =0 \u2192 7P =21F \u2192 P =3F. Yeah, that's right. \n\nSo for every failing student, there are 3 passing ones. So total students are P + F = 3F + F =4F. Therefore, the passing students are 3F out of 4F, which is 3/4. 3 divided by 4 is 0.75, so 75%? Wait, but 75% is option E. But let me look again. Wait, wait, maybe I messed up the ratio.

The overall average is 76. The passing average is 83, failing is55. So the difference between 83 and 76 is 7. Between 76 and 55 is 21. So the ratio of the number of students is the inverse of these differences. So passing to failing is 21:7, which simplifies to 3:1. So same as before. So passing is 3 parts out of 4 total, so 75%. So E is the answer. But wait, the options have E as 75%, so that must be it. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me plug in numbers. Suppose there are 3 passing and 1 failing. Total students 4.
