      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is to find the value of x given two equations: 6x minus y equals 24, and y equals 3x. Hmm, substitution maybe? Since the second equation gives y in terms of x, I can probably plug that into the first equation.\n\nSo the first equation is 6x - y =24. And the second says y is 3x. So if I substitute y in the first equation with 3x, that would make the equation 6x minus 3x equals 24. Wait, that simplifies to 3x =24? Then x would be 24 divided by 3, which is 8. Let me check the options. Option A is 8. But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through it again.\n\nOriginal equations:\n1) 6x - y =24\n2) y=3x\n\nSubstitute equation 2 into 1: 6x - (3x) =24. Yeah, that's 3x=24. So x=8. That's option A. But why are the other options higher? Did I do something wrong? Let me try another way. Suppose x is 8, then y would be 3*8=24. Plugging back into the first equation: 6*8 is 48, minus 24 gives 24, which matches the equation. So that works. So the answer must be A. Maybe the other options are traps if someone miscalculates. Like if someone added instead of subtracted, they might get a higher number. But no, the steps seem right. So I think the correct answer is A)8.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this algebra problem here. Let's see, the question is: If 6x minus y equals 24 and y equals 3x, what is the value of x? The options are from A to E, with numbers 8 up to 12. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nAlright, first, the problem gives two equations. The first one is 6x - y = 24, and the second is y = 3x. Since they're both equations with the same variables x and y, I can probably substitute one into the other to find x. Let me think.\n\nSince the second equation already expresses y in terms of x (y is 3x), substitution seems like the way to go. So, substitute y in the first equation with 3x. Let me write that out.\n\nOriginal first equation: 6x - y = 24. If y is 3x, then replacing y gives me 6x - (3x) = 24. Wait, that makes sense. Let me compute that. 6x minus 3x is 3x. So 3x equals 24? Then x would be 24 divided by 3, which is 8. Oh, so x is 8? Let me check the options. Option A is 8. So is that the answer?\n\nHold on, maybe I should verify. Let me plug the value back into both equations to make sure.\n\nFirst equation: 6x - y = 24. If x is 8, then 6*8 is 48. Then y would be 3x, so 3*8 is 24. So substituting into the first equation: 48 -24 equals 24. That works. \n\nSecond equation is y =3x, so if x is 8, y is 24, which is correct. So that checks out. Hmm, so then the answer must be A)8. \n\nWait, but why are the options going up to 12? Maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me go through it again. \n\nThe first equation: 6x - y =24. The second says y=3x. So substituting y into the first equation: 6x -3x =24. That simplifies to 3x=24. Dividing both sides by 3 gives x=8. Yeah, that seems right. So the answer is A. \n\nBut maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the question again. The equations are 6x - y =24 and y=3x. Yep. So substitution gives the same result. Hmm, perhaps the options are trying to trick me into thinking it's another answer? Like maybe adding instead of subtracting? Like if someone thought 6x +3x, that would be 9x, leading to x=24/9 which is not an integer. But that's not the case here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could mix up the equations. Like plugging 6x into the second equation? But no, the substitution seems straightforward. \n\nAnother way to solve it could be by using substitution the other way. Let's see. Since y=3x, we can plug that into the first equation. Which is exactly what I did. So I think my approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe solving the system using elimination. Let me try that method as a check. \n\nThe two equations are:\n\n1) 6x - y =24\n\n2) -3x + y =0 (since y=3x can be rewritten as y-3x=0)\n\nIf I add equation 1 and equation 2 together, the y terms will cancel. \n\nAdding left sides: 6x - y -3x + y = 3x. The right side: 24 +0=24. So 3x=24 again. So x=8. Yep, same answer. \n\nSo no matter which method I use, substitution or elimination, I get x=8, which is option A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A)8. The other options must be there to catch common mistakes. For example, if someone thought 6x +3x=24, that would give 9x=24 \u2192 x\u22482.666, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe miscalculating 24 divided by 3 as 8, which is correct. Wait, 3 times 8 is 24. So yeah, that's right. \n\nHmm, I can't see any mistake here. I think I'm confident that the answer is A.\n",
