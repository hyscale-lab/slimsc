      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Roy has these five tablets, and he needs to take one every 15 minutes. The question is asking how long it will take him to finish all of them. Hmm, let me think.\n\nWait, sometimes these problems can be tricky because they might be testing whether you count the intervals correctly. Like, if you have to take a tablet every certain amount of time, the total time isn't just the number of tablets multiplied by the interval. Because the first tablet is at time zero, right?\n\nSo let's see. Let's break it down step by step. Let's say he starts taking the first tablet at time zero. Then the next one is 15 minutes later. So the first tablet is at 0 minutes, the second at 15, third at 30, fourth at 45, fifth at 60. Wait, that's five tablets. So the time from the first to the last would be 60 minutes. But does the question ask when he finishes taking the last one, or the total time between the first and last? Because the question says \"how much time will it take Roy to consume all the 5 tablets.\" So that would be from the first tablet to when he takes the fifth. \n\nWait, let me count again. Let's list the times:\n\n1st tablet: 0 minutes\n2nd: 15\n3rd: 30\n4th: 45\n5th: 60\n\nSo the fifth is taken at 60 minutes. So the total time from the first to the fifth is 60 minutes. So the answer would be E) 60 minutes. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)45, B)75, C)90, D)120, E)60. So E is 60. But maybe I made a mistake here. Because sometimes people might think that between the first and fifth, there are four intervals. Let me see. The number of intervals between 5 tablets is 4. So 4 times 15 is 60. Wait, no. Wait, the first tablet is at time 0, then each subsequent adds 15. So the fifth is at 60, so total time is 60 minutes. So that would be E. But wait, maybe the question is phrased as \"how much time to consume all,\" meaning from the first to the last, which is indeed 60. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that you have to wait 15 minutes after taking the first, so total time is 5\u00d715=75. But that's wrong because the first is taken immediately. Let me think again. Let's see another way. If he takes one every 15 minutes, how many intervals are there between 5 tablets. The number of intervals is (number of tablets -1). So 5-1=4 intervals. 4\u00d715=60. So that's correct. So the answer is E, 60 minutes. So the correct option is E.\n",

Let me think carefully here.\n\nFirst, sometimes these problems can be tricky because people might just multiply the number of tablets by the interval, but that might not be right. Like, if you take the first tablet at time zero, then the next ones are after 15, 30, etc. So let's break it down step by step.\n\nLet's say Roy starts taking the first tablet right away. So the first tablet is at 0 minutes. Then the second one would be at 15 minutes. Third at 30, fourth at 45, and fifth at 60 minutes. Wait, so how many intervals are there between the tablets? Between 5 tablets, there are 4 intervals. Because between the first and second is one interval, second to third another, and so on until fourth to fifth. So each interval is 15 minutes, so 4 intervals would be 4 * 15 = 60 minutes. But then the total time from the first to the last tablet is 60 minutes. But the question is asking how much time until he consumes all 5. So the first tablet is at 0, and the fifth is at 60 minutes. So the total time from the start until the last tablet is 60 minutes. But wait, does that mean the answer is 60? Let me check the options. Option E is 60. But wait, another way people might think is 5 tablets, each 15 minutes apart. So 5 times 15 would be 75. But that would be incorrect because the first tablet is at time zero. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the doctor told him to take one every 15 minutes starting after the first. Like, first at time 0, then 15, 30, 45, 60. So total time from first to last is 60 minutes. So he finishes the fifth at 60 minutes. So total time taken to consume all is 60 minutes. So the answer would be E)60? But wait, the options have B as 75 and E as 60. Hmm. Let me see another angle.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased such that the first tablet is taken at time zero, then each subsequent one after 15 minutes. So for 5 tablets, the time between the first and last is (5-1)*15. So 4*15 =60. So total time from first to last is 60 minutes. So the total time taken to consume all 5 would be 60 minutes. So the answer is E. But maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think of an example with fewer tablets. Like if he had 2 tablets, taking one every 15 minutes. Then the first at 0, the second at 15. Total time is 15 minutes. So 2 tablets take 15 minutes. So 5 would be 4 intervals, so 60. So the answer is 60, option E. But why is there an option B (75) there? Maybe I'm making a mistake. Wait another way: if he has to take one every 15 minutes, starting after the first. Like, first tablet, then wait 15, take second, etc. So the time from first to second is 15. So total time would be (number of intervals) *15. The number of intervals is 4, so 60. So yeah, that's correct. So the answer is E)60. Hmm, but maybe the question is a trick question. Like, maybe he has to take the first tablet, then after 15 minutes the next, so the total time from the first to the fifth is 60, but the total time until all are consumed would be 60 minutes.
