      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. Fernando has a meal plan with 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week. The cafeteria is closed on weekends, so weekends don't count. And he goes home for dinner on Friday nights, so he can't use a dinner that day. Hmm, so I need to figure out how many ways he can allocate his meals throughout the week.\n\nFirst, let's break down the days. The week here probably refers to Monday through Friday, since weekends are closed. Wait, but Friday is part of the week. But he can't have dinner on Friday. So for dinners, he can have them from Monday to Thursday, right? Because Friday's dinner is at home. \n\nSo let's think about lunches and dinners separately. \n\nStarting with lunches. Since the cafeteria is open Monday to Friday, there are 5 days for lunches. He needs to choose 3 days out of these 5 to have lunch. Wait, but does he have to have exactly one lunch each day he chooses? Like, each lunch is used on a different day. So the number of ways to choose 3 days out of 5 for lunches would be combination 5 choose 3, which is 5C3.\n\nNow dinners. He has 3 dinners allowed. But the cafeteria is open Monday to Friday, but he can't have dinner on Friday. So the available days for dinners are Monday to Thursday, which is 4 days. He needs to choose 3 days out of these 4 to have dinner. So that would be 4 choose 3, which is 4C3.\n\nSo multiplying those two combinations gives the total number of options. So the formula would be 5C3 multiplied by 4C3. Wait, looking at the options, option A is 5C3 *4C3. That would be the answer? But let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are A through E. Let me check each option again. Option E is 4C3 *4C3, which would be if both were 4 choose 3, but lunches were 5 days. So A seems right. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait another thought: Wait, maybe the problem is that he has exactly 3 lunches and 3 dinners. The days for lunches are 5 days (Mon-Fri), so choosing 3 days for lunch. For dinners, since Friday's dinner is at home, he can have dinners on Mon-Thu (4 days), so he needs to pick 3 days out of those 4. So yes, 5C3 *4C3, which is option A. But hold on, let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers. Let me confirm:\n\nLunch days: 5 (Mon-Fri). Need to pick 3 days for lunch: 5C3.\n\nDinner days: 4 (Mon-Thu), since Friday's dinner is excluded. Need to pick 3 days for dinner: 4C3.\n\nSo the total options are 5C3 multiplied by 4C3, which is option A. Hmm, but let me check the options again to be sure.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)5C3 *4C3 \u2192 yes, that's exactly what I got.\n\nB)5C4 *4C2 \u2192 that would be if lunches required 4 days and dinners 2, which isn't the case here.\n\nC)5C2 *4C4 \u2192 2 lunches? No, he needs 3.\n\nD)5C6? That's impossible since you can't choose 6 from 5. So D is invalid.\n\nE)4C3*4C3 \u2192 that would be if both were 4 choose 3, but lunches have 5 days. So E is not correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be A. Wait, but wait another thought: Does the problem state that he must use exactly 3 lunches and 3 dinners each week? So he can't skip any. So he has to choose exactly 3 days for lunch and 3 days for dinner. Since the cafeteria is closed weekends, so the days are Monday-Friday. So yes, that's exactly the reasoning. So the answer should be A. But why is option E there? Oh, maybe I made a mistake in the dinner days?\n\nWait, Friday's dinner is at home, so he can't use a dinner on Friday. So for dinners, the available days are 4 (Mon-Thu). So he must choose 3 days from those 4. So 4C3. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, the answer is A. So the correct option is A.\n",

The week here probably refers to the standard Monday to Friday, since weekends are closed. Wait, but Friday is part of the weekday, right? But he can't have dinner there on Friday. So the dinners available are only from Monday to Thursday? Because Friday's dinner is at home. Wait, the problem says he always goes home for Friday's dinner. So for dinners, he can only use the meal plan for Monday to Thursday dinners. But his total allowed dinners per week are 3. So he has to choose 3 dinners out of the available days where he can use them.\n\nSimilarly for lunches. Since the cafeteria is closed on weekends, lunches are only available from Monday to Friday. Wait, the problem says the cafeteria is closed on weekends. So the weekdays are Monday-Friday. So lunches can be had on any of those five days, but he has 3 lunches to allocate. So he needs to choose 3 days out of the 5 for lunch. \n\nWait, but for dinners, since he can't use Friday's dinner (he goes home), the dinners are available on Monday to Thursday.

Let me re-express the problem.\n\nTotal days in the week the cafeteria is open for lunch: Monday-Friday (5 days). So he has 3 lunches to allocate over 5 days. So the number of ways for lunches is 5 choose 3.\n\nFor dinners: the cafeteria is open Monday-Friday, but he can't use Friday. So dinners are available Monday-Thursday (4 days). He needs to have 3 dinners. So he must choose 3 days out of those 4. So that's 4 choose 3. \n\nTherefore, the total options would be (5C3)*(4C3). Which is exactly option A. So the answer should be A. But let me check the other options just in case.\n\nOption B is 5C4 *4C2. That would be if he had 4 lunches and 2 dinners, but the problem states 3 each. So no. Option C is 5C2 *4C4, which would be choosing 2 lunches and 4 dinners, which is not the case. D is 5C6 which isn't possible, since you can't choose 6 from 5.
