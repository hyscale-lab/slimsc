      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about the difference between simple interest and compound interest for 2 years being Rs.72 on a principal of Rs.5000. I need to find the rate of interest. The options are given from A to E. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI) formulas for two years. Let me recall them. \n\nThe simple interest formula is straightforward: SI = P * R * T / 100. Since the time here is 2 years, that would be P*R*2/100. \n\nFor compound interest, since it's compounded annually (I assume that's the case here unless stated otherwise), the amount after two years would be P*(1 + R/100)^2. The compound interest itself is the amount minus principal, so CI = P*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ). \n\nThe problem states that the difference between CI and SI is Rs.72. So, CI - SI = 72. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote the principal as P = 5000, time T = 2 years, rate R (which we need to find). \n\nSo, substituting the formulas:\n\nCI - SI = 72\n\nFirst, let me compute CI - SI using their formulas. Let me compute both expressions.\n\nFirst, CI:\n\nCI = P*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ) \n\nExpanding that, (1 + R/100)^2 is 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. So subtracting 1 gives 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100)^2. \n\nTherefore, CI = P*( 2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 )\n\nThe simple interest for two years is SI = (P*R*2)/100.\n\nSo the difference CI - SI is:\n\n[ P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 ) ] - [ (P*2R)/100 ]\n\nSimplifying that, the terms with 2R/100 cancel out, leaving only the R squared term:\n\nCI - SI = P*( R\u00b2 ) / (100)^2 \n\nWait, that's a key point. So the difference between CI and SI for two years is equal to P*(R^2)/(100^2). Because the other terms in CI and SI cancel each other. \n\nWait, let me verify that again. Let me compute CI - SI step by step:\n\nCI = P [ (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ] = P [ 1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2 -1 ] = P [ 2R/100 + (R^2)/(100^2) ]\n\nSI = (P*R*2)/100 \n\nSubtracting SI from CI:\n\nCI - SI = P [ 2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 - 2R/100 ] \n\nYes, the 2R/100 terms cancel, so indeed, CI - SI = P*(R\u00b2)/(100)^2.\n\nSo the formula simplifies to:\n\nDifference = (P * R\u00b2) / (100)^2 \n\nGiven that this difference is 72, and P is 5000, we can plug in the numbers:\n\n72 = (5000 * R\u00b2) / (10000) \n\nBecause 100 squared is 10000. Let me compute that equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by 10000:\n\n72 * 10000 = 5000 * R\u00b2 \n\nSo 720,000 = 5000 R\u00b2 \n\nDivide both sides by 5000:\n\n720000 / 5000 = R\u00b2 \n\nCalculating that: 720000 divided by 5000. Let's see, 5000 goes into 720,000 how many times?\n\nWell, 5000 * 144 = 720,000. Because 5000*100=500,000, 5000*44=220,000, so 144*5000 is 720,000. So R squared is 144.\n\nTherefore R\u00b2 = 144 \u2192 R = sqrt(144) = 12. \n\nSo the rate is 12%. Looking at the options, B is 12%, so the answer should be B. \n\nWait, let me check if I made any calculation errors. Let's go through the steps again:\n\nDifference = (5000 * R\u00b2)/10000 = 72.\n\nSimplify the left side: 5000 divided by 10000 is 0.5. So 0.5 * R\u00b2 =72 \u2192 R\u00b2 = 72 / 0.5 \u2192 144. So yes, same result. So R is 12%. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A)10%, B)12%, C)6%, D)8%, E)4%. So B is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check with the actual formulas to confirm. Let me try with 12% and see if the difference is indeed 72.\n\nCompute SI for two years at 12% on 5000:\n\nSI = (5000 *12 *2)/100 = (5000*24)/100 = 5000/100 *24 = 50*24= 1200.\n\nCI: Let's compute the amount after two years. \n\nFirst year interest: 5000 *12/100 = 600. So amount after first year is 5600.\n\nSecond year: 5600 *12/100 = 672. So total CI is 600 +672 = 1272. \n\nDifference between CI and SI is 1272 - 1200 = 72. Exactly matches the problem's statement. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore the answer is B)12%.\n",

The principal is Rs.5000, and the difference is Rs.72. I need to find the rate of interest. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that simple interest (SI) and compound interest (CI) formulas are different. For two years, maybe there's a simpler way to find the difference without calculating each separately. Wait, I think there's a formula for the difference between CI and SI for two years. Let me recall that.\n\nThe formula for simple interest for two years is straightforward: SI = P * R * T / 100. Since T is 2 years here, that would be 2PR/100. \n\nCompound interest is calculated on the principal plus the interest of the first year. So for two years, the CI would be P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. Let me expand that. \n\nBreaking it down, CI = P[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1] = P[( (1 + R/100) + 1)( (1 + R/100) -1 ) ]? Wait, no, maybe better to just expand the square. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute CI as the first year's interest plus the second year's interest which includes interest on the first year's interest. So after first year, the amount is P + (P*R)/100. Then the second year's interest would be (P + (P*R)/100) * R/100. So total CI after two years is P + first year interest + second year interest, minus the principal. \n\nSo the CI total would be P*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ). \n\nThe difference between CI and SI for two years is CI - SI. Let me write expressions for both.\n\nSI for two years is (P*R*2)/100.\n\nCI for two years is P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) = P*[ (1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2 ) -1 ] = P*(2R/100 + (R^2)/(100)^2 )\n\nSo CI - SI = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(100)^2 ) - (2PR/100) \n\nThe 2PR/100 terms cancel out, so we're left with P*( R\u00b2 / 10000 ). \n\nWait, that's interesting. So the difference between CI and SI for two years is P*(R\u00b2)/(100)^2. \n\nIs that correct? Let me check again. Let me compute CI - SI:\n\nCI = P[(1 + r)^2 -1] where r is R/100. \n\nExpanding (1 + r)^2 -1 = 1 + 2r + r\u00b2 -1 = 2r + r\u00b2. \n\nSo CI = P*(2r + r\u00b2). \n\nSI is P*2r. \n\nSo CI - SI = P*r\u00b2. \n\nSince r is R/100, then substituting back, r\u00b2 is (R/100)^2. \n\nTherefore, CI - SI = P*(R/100)^2. \n\nWait, so the difference is P*(R\u00b2)/(100)^2. \n\nAh, right. So the formula is (P * R\u00b2 ) / (100)^2 = difference. \n\nSo according to the problem, the difference is 72. The principal is 5000. \n\nSo substituting:\n\n5000 * (R\u00b2) / (100^2) = 72 \n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n(5000 * R\u00b2) / 10000 = 72 \n\nSimplify 5000/10000 = 0.5. So 0.5 * R\u00b2 =72 \n\nThen R\u00b2 = 72 *2 = 144 \n\nTherefore, R = sqrt(144) = 12. \n\nSo the rate is 12%, which is option B. \n\nWait, let me check the options. The options are A)10%, B)12%, C)6%, D)8%, E)4%. So yes, B is 12%, so that must be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the formula.

Since r is R/100, then yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can plug in the numbers with each option to confirm. \n\nLet me try with 12%. \n\nCompute SI first: 5000 * 12 *2 /100 = 5000*24/100 = 1200. \n\nCI: 5000*(1 + 0.12)^2 -5000. \n\nFirst year amount: 5000*1.12 = 5600.

Exactly the given difference. \n\nSo yes, that works. \n\nIf I tried another option, like 10%, let's see: \n\nSI would be 5000*10*2=1000. \n\nCI: 5000*(1.1)^2 -5000 = 5000*(1.21) -5000= 6050-5000=1050. \n\nDifference is 50. Not 72. \n\nSo 10% is not correct. \n\nFor 8%, let's see:\n\nSI: 5000*8*2/100 = 800. \n\nCI: 5000*(1.08)^2 -5000. 1.08 squared is 1.1664. 5000*1.1664=5832. CI is 832. \n\nDifference: 832-800=32.

Since r is R/100, then yes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can plug in the numbers with each option to confirm. \n\nLet me try with 12%. \n\nCompute SI first: 5000 * 12 *2 /100 = 5000*24/100 = 1200. \n\nCI: 5000*(1 + 0.12)^2 -5000. \n\nFirst year amount: 5000*1.12 = 5600. Second year: 5600*1.12 = 6272. \n\nCI total is 6272-5000=1272. \n\nDifference between CI and SI is 1272 -1200 =72. Exactly the given difference. \n\nSo yes, that works. \n\nIf I tried another option, like 10%, let's see: \n\nSI would be 5000*10*2=1000. \n\nCI: 5000*(1.1)^2 -5000 = 5000*(1.21) -5000= 6050-5000=1050. \n\nDifference is 50. Not 72. \n\nSo 10% is not correct. \n\nFor 8%, let's see:\n\nSI: 5000*8*2/100 = 800. \n\nCI: 5000*(1.08)^2 -5000. 1.08 squared is 1.1664. 5000*1.1664=5832. CI is 832. \n\nDifference: 832-800=32. Not 72. \n\nSo D is not. \n\nWhat about 6%?\n\nSI: 5000*6*2=600. \n\nCI: 5000*(1.06)^2 -5000 = 5000*(1.1236)=5618. So CI is 618. \n\nDifference 618-600=18. Nope. \n\nSo B is correct. \n\nTherefore the answer should be B)12%.\n\n\nThe difference between compound interest (CI) and simple interest (SI) for two years can be calculated using the formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{CI} - \\text{SI} = \\frac{P \\times R^2}{100^2}\n\\]  \nGiven \\( P = 5000 \\), and the difference is 72, substituting the values:  \n\\[\n\\frac{5000 \\times R^2}{10000} = 72  \n\\]  \nSimplifying:  \n\\[\n0.5 \\times R^2 = 72 \\implies R^2 = 144 \\implies R = 12\\%  \n\\]  \nVerifying with \\( R = 12\\% \\):  \n- **SI**: \\( \\frac{5000 \\times 12 \\times 2}{100} = 1200 \\)  \n- **CI**: \\( 5000 \\times (1 + 0.12)^2 - 5000 = 1272 \\)  \n- **Difference**: \\( 1272 - 1200 = 72 \\), which matches the given condition.  \n\nThus, the correct answer is **B)12%**.  \n\nAnswer: B",
