      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about calculating the total discount when there are two successive discounts applied. The manufacturer gives a 20% discount first, and then the retailer adds another 20% discount. Hmm, I need to figure out what the total discount would be in that case.\n\nWait, I remember that when you have two discounts, you can't just add them together. Like, 20% plus another 20% isn't 40%, right? Because the second discount is applied after the first one. So the second 20% is on the already discounted price. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose the original price of the tyre is $100. \n\nFirst, the manufacturer's 20% discount would reduce the price by 20% of 100, which is $20. So the price after the first discount is $80. \n\nNow the retailer offers an additional 20% discount on this new price. So 20% of $80 is $16. Subtracting that from $80 gives $64. \n\nSo the final price after both discounts is $64. The total discount from the original $100 is $36. That's a 36% discount overall. Wait, but 36% is option E. But I thought maybe the answer could be 36? But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for combining two successive discounts. The formula is: total discount = a + b - (a*b)/100, where a and b are the two discounts. Let me try that. Here, a is 20 and b is 20. So 20 +20 - (20*20)/100 = 40 - 400/100 = 40 -4 = 36. Oh, so that gives 36% which matches the example. So the answer should be E?\n\nWait but some people might think that the answer is 40% but that's wrong because the discounts are applied successively. So the correct answer here is E)36%? Let me confirm once more with another example. Let's take original price as 200.\n\nFirst discount 20%: 200 - 40 = 160. Then another 20% on 160 is 32, so final price is 128. Total discount is 200 -128 =72. 72/200 is 0.36, so 36% again. Yep, that seems right. So the answer must be E.\n",
