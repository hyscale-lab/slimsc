      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: the population of a city increases by 5% annually. The current population is 78,000, and I need to find out what it will be in two years. The options are given as A to E, with E being none of these. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that percentage increase over multiple years is calculated using the formula for compound growth. Since the population increases by 5% each year, each year's population is the previous year's multiplied by 1 plus the growth rate. The growth rate here is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. So the multiplier per year would be 1.05.\n\nThe formula for population after n years would be: \n\nFinal Population = Initial Population \u00d7 (1 + rate)^n\n\nIn this case, the initial population is 78,000, the rate is 0.05, and n is 2 years. Plugging those numbers in, I get:\n\n78000 \u00d7 (1.05)^2\n\nHmm, let me calculate that. First, I need to compute (1.05)^2. 1.05 squared is 1.1025, right? Because 1.05 times 1.05 equals 1.1025. \n\nSo then, multiplying 78,000 by 1.1025. Let me do that step by step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking it down into parts. Let's see: 78,000 times 1.1 would be 85,800. But since the actual multiplier is a bit more than 1.1, the result should be a bit higher than 85,800. Wait, but 1.1025 is 1.1 plus 0.0025. \n\nAlternatively, maybe compute 78,000 * 1.05 first, then multiply that result by 1.05 again for the second year. Let's try that way.\n\nFirst year increase: 78,000 * 1.05. \n\nCalculating that: 78,000 * 1.05. Let's break down 1.05 as 1 + 0.05. So 78,000 + 5% of 78,000. \n\n5% of 78,000 is (78,000 * 0.05) = 3,900. \n\nSo adding that to the original population: 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. That's the population after the first year. \n\nNow, for the second year, we take that 81,900 and increase it by another 5%. \n\nSo 5% of 81,900 is 81,900 * 0.05. Let's compute that. \n\nWell, 10% of 81,900 is 8,190, so half of that is 4,095. So 5% is 4,095. \n\nAdding that to 81,900 gives 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995. \n\nSo after two years, the population would be 85,995. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 85,995. Option C is 85,800, which is what I thought when I considered 1.1 times 78,000. But since the actual multiplier is 1.1025, the correct calculation gives a higher number. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made an error in the calculation steps. Let me recalculate using the first method where (1.05)^2 is 1.1025. \n\n78,000 multiplied by 1.1025. Let's do that. \n\nFirst, 78,000 * 1 = 78,000. \n\nThen 78,000 * 0.1025. Let me compute 0.1 times 78,000 is 7,800. \n\nThen 0.0025 times 78,000. \n\n0.0025 is a quarter of a percent. 1% of 78,000 is 780, so 0.25% is 780 / 4 = 195. \n\nSo adding 0.1 and 0.0025 parts: 7,800 + 195 = 7,995. \n\nTherefore, total is 78,000 + 7,995 = 85,995. Yep, same as before. \n\nSo the correct answer should be B)85,995. \n\nLooking at the options again, option C is 85,800, which would be if someone just added 5% once and then multiplied by 2, but that's not the correct way. Because the increase each year is on the new population, so it's compounded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might have miscalculated 1.05 squared? Let me see: 1.05 *1.05 is indeed 1.1025. So that part is right. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options given are:\n\nA)81900\n\nB)85995\n\nC)85800\n\nD)90000\n\nE)None of these\n\nSo B is an option, so the correct answer is B. Therefore the answer is B. \n\nHmm, but wait another thought: sometimes in some problems, people might think of simple interest, but population growth is definitely a compound growth scenario. So simple interest would be 5% each year on the original principal. So 5% of 78,000 is 3,900 per year, so two years would be 7,800 total, leading to 78,000 +7,800=85,800 (option C). But that's incorrect because population growth is compounded. So the correct answer is B, so the answer is B.\n",

Hmm, let's think.\n\nFirst, I remember that percentage increase can be calculated using the formula for compound growth. Since it's increasing by 5% annually, each year's population is 105% of the previous year's. So for two years, I probably have to apply the 5% increase twice.\n\nThe formula should be something like: Future Population = Current Population \u00d7 (1 + rate)^number of years. Right?

Wait, let me calculate that step by step. \n\nFirst, let me compute 1.05 squared. 1.05 times 1.05. Let's do that. 1.05 * 1.05.

So the multiplier is 1.1025 after two years. \n\nSo the population would be 78,000 * 1.1025. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 78,000 times 1.1 is 85,800. Because 10% of 78,000 is 7,800, so 10% plus 1% (780) makes 8,580. So adding that to 78,000 gives 86,580? Wait, no, wait. Wait, maybe I should break it down differently.

Let's calculate that. 10% is 8,190, so 5% is half of that: 4,095. So adding that to 81,900 gives 81,900 +4,095 = 85,995. \n\nYes, that matches the previous result.
