      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the range of x given that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. The expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression again to make sure I have it right:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) + 16] / [n + 4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, the numerator is n squared plus 2 times sqrt(n) times (n+4), plus 16? Or maybe the 2\u221an is multiplied by (n +4)? The way it's written could be a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original question again. Oh right, the question says \"2\u221an(n +4)\". So probably, the 2 is multiplied by sqrt(n), which is then multiplied by (n+4). So the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an*(n+4) +16. \n\nHmm, maybe the numerator is a perfect square? Let me think. Let's see: if I can write the numerator as something squared. Let's consider (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the first term is (sqrt(n))\u00b2, so a = sqrt(n). Then the middle term would need to be 2ab, so 2ab = 2*sqrt(n)*b. Comparing to the given term 2\u221an*(n+4), that suggests that b is (n+4). Wait, but then the last term would be b squared, which would be (n+4)^2. But in the numerator, the last term is 16. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (sqrt(n)^2 + something)^2? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator can be factored as a square as well. Let's check the denominator first:\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let me see: Let me set \u221an = t. Then n = t\u00b2, so denominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4. Oh! That's (t +2)^2. Because (t + 2)^2 = t\u00b2 +4t +4. So the denominator simplifies to (\u221an + 2)^2. That's helpful.\n\nNow, what about the numerator? Let me also express the numerator in terms of t where t = sqrt(n). Since n = t\u00b2, then:\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16\n\nSubstituting n = t\u00b2, that becomes:\n\n(t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (t\u00b2)^2 = t^4\n\nSecond term: 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 +8t\n\nThird term: 16.\n\nSo altogether, numerator is t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, can this be factored?\n\nHmm, let's see if it factors into something squared. Let me think again. Maybe the numerator is (t^2 + a t + b)^2? Let me try expanding that:\n\n(t^2 + a t + b)^2 = t^4 + 2a t^3 + (a\u00b2 + 2b) t\u00b2 + 2ab t + b\u00b2.\n\nComparing to our numerator: t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. The coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of t^4: 1, matches.\n\nCoefficient of t^3: 2a = 2 \u21d2 a=1.\n\nCoefficient of t^2 term: (a\u00b2 + 2b) must equal the coefficient in our numerator. But our numerator has no t\u00b2 term. So (1 + 2b) must be zero? That would mean 1 +2b=0 \u21d2 b = -0.5. But then the next terms:\n\nThe t term is 2ab t. With a=1 and b=-0.5, that would be 2*(1)*(-0.5) t = -t. But in our numerator, the t term is +8t, so that's not matching. Hmm, so that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (t^2 + something)(something else). Let me see:\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-calculate the numerator expression again. Wait, when I substituted n = t\u00b2, the numerator is:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16 = (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nSo expanding that: t^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2) + 2t*4 +16.\n\nWhich is t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. Wait, that's correct. So the numerator is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps grouping terms. Let me try grouping terms:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Let's see:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 can be factored as t^3(t+2). Then the remaining terms 8t +16 = 8(t +2). So altogether:\n\nt^3(t+2) +8(t+2) = (t+2)(t^3 +8).\n\nAh! That's a good step. So numerator factors into (t +2)(t^3 +8). Now, t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, since 8 = 2^3. The formula for sum of cubes is a^3 +b^3 = (a +b)(a^2 -ab +b^2). So t^3 +8 = (t +2)(t^2 - 2t +4). Therefore, numerator becomes:\n\n(t +2)*(t +2)*(t^2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4).\n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4), and the denominator is (t +2)^2. Therefore, when we divide numerator by denominator, the (t+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving us with (t^2 -2t +4).\n\nTherefore, x simplifies to t^2 -2t +4, where t = sqrt(n). \n\nSo substituting back t = sqrt(n), we have:\n\nx = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait a second. Let me check that again. Wait, t^2 is (sqrt(n)) squared, which is n. So yes, so substituting back, x = t\u00b2 -2t +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, that simplifies the expression a lot! So the original expression simplifies to x = n - 2\u221an +4. That's a much easier expression to work with. \n\nNow, since n is between 36 and 72, inclusive, let's see what the possible values of x can be. Let me first note that n is in [36,72], so sqrt(n) is between 6 and 8.485 (since sqrt(72) is 8.485...). \n\nSo, let's denote t = sqrt(n), so that t \u2208 [6, sqrt(72)]. Since sqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. \n\nTherefore, x = t^2 - 2t +4. Wait, but since t^2 is n, so substituting back, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of x in terms of t. Let me write x as a function of t: x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4, where t ranges from 6 to sqrt(72). \n\nWe need to find the minimum and maximum values of x(t) over this interval of t. \n\nTo find the extrema, since this is a quadratic function in terms of t, but since t is a variable here, let me see. Wait, the function x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4 is a quadratic in t, which opens upwards (since the coefficient of t\u00b2 is positive). Its vertex is at t = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1) = 1. So the vertex is at t=1, which is a minimum. But our t ranges from 6 to ~8.485, so the minimum on this interval will be at the leftmost point, t=6, and maximum at the rightmost point, t= sqrt(72). \n\nWait, let me confirm that. Since the parabola opens upwards, the vertex at t=1 is the minimum point. So for t values greater than 1, the function is increasing. Since our interval [6, sqrt(72)] is entirely to the right of the vertex, the function is increasing on this interval. Therefore, the minimum is at t=6, and maximum at t = sqrt(72). \n\nTherefore, compute x at t=6 and t= sqrt(72):\n\nFirst, at t=6:\n\nx = (6)^2 -2*(6) +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nAt t= sqrt(72). Let's compute sqrt(72). sqrt(72)= 6*sqrt(2) \u22486*1.4142\u22488.48528. But let's compute exactly:\n\nx at t = sqrt(72):\n\nx = (sqrt(72))\u00b2 -2*sqrt(72) +4 = 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4 = 76 - 2*sqrt(72).\n\nHmm, need to compute that. Let me compute 2*sqrt(72). sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2), so 2*6\u221a2 =12\u221a2. So:\n\nx =76 -12\u221a2. \n\nWait, but maybe we can compute the numerical value to see the range. Let me compute sqrt(72) first: approximately 8.48528. \n\nSo 2*sqrt(72) = 2*8.48528 \u224816.97056. \n\nTherefore, 76 -16.97056 \u224859.02944. \n\nSo x at maximum t is approximately 59.03. \n\nTherefore, the minimum x is 28, and the maximum is approximately 59.03. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. Since the maximum is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so the upper bound is okay. The lower bound is exactly 28, but the question says \"n such that 36 \u2264n \u226472\". Wait, when n is exactly 36, then sqrt(n)=6, so x is exactly 28. But the options have inequalities like \"28 < x < 60\". Wait, the question says \"satisfies\" one of the options. \n\nWait, let me check if the endpoints are included. The original problem says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So when n=36, x=28 exactly. So the possible x values are from 28 (inclusive) up to approximately 59.03 (exclusive, since n can be 72, but the upper limit of the expression when n=72 is exactly 59.03? Wait, actually when n=72, sqrt(n)=sqrt(72), so that would be exactly the maximum value. So x would be exactly 76 - 12\u221a2. Let me compute that precisely:\n\n\u221a2 is approximately 1.41421356, so 12*1.41421356 \u224816.9705627. So 76 minus that is 76-16.9705627=59.0294373. So that's approximately 59.03, which is less than 60. \n\nSo the possible x values are from 28 (inclusive) up to approximately 59.03 (so less than 60). \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says \"28 < x <60\". But the minimum x is 28, so x can be equal to 28 when n=36. Therefore, the inequality in option D is strict on the lower side. But the question says \"satisfies\" one of the options. So if the options are written with strict inequalities, then 28 is allowed, but the option D requires x>28, so that would exclude the case when x=28. Therefore, the actual possible x is 28 \u2264 x < ~59.03. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 the upper limit is too low.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 upper limit is 58, but our upper is ~59, so that's too low.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 upper is okay, but lower is okay but the lower bound here is 25 which is less than 28. Since x can be 28, so the lower bound 25 is okay, but the problem is the upper bound. Wait, no, the upper bound of 64 is higher than 59, so the upper limit would be okay. Wait, but the question is which of the options the x satisfies. The actual maximum x is ~59, so 64 is higher, so the upper part is okay. But the lower bound here is 25, which is lower than 28, so the interval 25 <x <64 would include all x from 28 up, so that's true. But the options are asking which one is correct. Wait but let me check other options.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 the lower bound is strict. Since x can be exactly 28, then the interval 28 <x would exclude that case. So the correct interval would include 28 as a possible value, so D's lower bound is not correct.\n\nE) None of these. \n\nHmm, so the correct range is 28 \u2264x < ~59.03. So looking at the options:\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64. Since 25 is less than 28, and 64 is higher than the upper limit, the actual x values lie entirely within this interval. So option C's range includes all possible x values. \n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"satisfies\". The options are ranges that x must lie within. So if the possible x values are between 28 and ~59.03, then any x in that interval must lie within the given options' ranges. So let's see which options include all possible x:\n\nOption C: 25 to 64. Since all x between 28 and 59 are within 25-64. So yes, that's true. \n\nOption D: 28 to 60. Since the maximum is ~59, which is less than 60, so the interval would be 28 to ~59. So the lower bound is exactly 28 (but D says 28 <x, so x can't be 28). The upper bound is okay. So the actual x values are from 28 up to ~59. So D's interval is (28, 60), which excludes the minimum point (when x=28). Therefore, the correct answer must include x=28, so D is not correct. \n\nOption C includes x=28 (since 25 <28 <64). Therefore, the correct answer would be C?\n\nWait, but let me check the other options again. \n\nOption B: 23 <x <58. The upper limit is 58, which is less than 59, so the upper part is too low. So the maximum x is ~59, which is outside of B's upper limit, so B is incorrect.\n\nOption D's upper limit is 60, which is okay, but lower is strict. \n\nOption A's upper is 54, which is way too low. \n\nSo between C and D. The problem is whether the options are strict inequalities. The question says \"satisfies\" which of the options. \n\nThe original expression: when n=36, x=28 exactly. So x can be equal to 28, so the correct interval must include 28 as a possible value. So any option that has x>28 would exclude that, so D is out. Option C says 25 <x <64, which includes 28. \n\nSimilarly, the maximum value is ~59.03, which is less than 64, so that's okay. So the entire range of x is within C's interval. So the answer would be C?\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a mistake in my calculations. Because the options given include D (28 <x <60). Since the maximum x is ~59.03, which is less than 60, so the maximum is within D's upper limit. But D requires x>28, but since x can be exactly 28, that's not included in D. So the correct interval would be [28, ~59.03). \n\nSo the only option that includes all possible x is C (25 <x <64). Because even if the lower bound of C is 25, which is lower than the actual minimum of 28, but since all x's are above 25, that's okay. Similarly, the upper bound is 64, which is higher than needed. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C. Wait, but let me double-check the problem again. \n\nWait, let me re-calculate the maximum x when n=72. Let me compute that again:\n\nx = n -2\u221an +4.\n\nAt n=72:\n\nx =72 -2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nsqrt(72)= 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485281374.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72) is about 16.97056275.\n\n72 +4 =76. So 76 -16.97056275 = 59.02943725. So approximately 59.03.\n\nTherefore, the maximum x is approximately 59.03, which is less than 60. So D's upper limit of 60 is okay, but the lower limit is 28, but since x can be exactly 28, D's inequality is 28 <x <60, which would exclude x=28. So the correct interval must include x=28, so the only option that includes 28 is option C (since 25 <x <64 includes 28). \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C?\n\nWait, but let me check if any of the other options might have a better fit. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nC)25 <x <64. The lower bound is 25. Since the minimum x is 28, which is greater than 25, so that's okay. The upper is 64, which is higher than the actual max. So the entire x's values are within C. \n\nD)28 <x <60. The lower bound is too strict (excludes x=28), but the upper is okay. \n\nSo since the question is asking which of the options is correct, and the actual x can be 28, which is not included in D, but included in C, so C is the correct answer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification step. Let me double-check the algebra again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me substitute n = t\u00b2 again, so t = sqrt(n). Then:\n\nNumerator: (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator: t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nThen, numerator was factored as (t+2)(t^3 +8) = (t+2)(t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2-2t+4). \n\nTherefore, numerator divided by denominator is (t^2 -2t +4). \n\nWait, but substituting back, that's x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is sqrt(n), so t\u00b2 is n, so x = n - 2t +4 = n -2\u221an +4. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nWait, but when I calculated x at t=6 (n=36), that gives x= 36 - 12 +4 =28. \n\nAt n=72, x=72 -2*sqrt(72)+4 \u224859.03. \n\nTherefore, the range is from 28 to ~59.03. \n\nSo the possible x is between 28 and ~59.03. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nC)25 <x <64. Since 28 is greater than 25, and 59.03 is less than 64, so the entire interval is within C. \n\nD)28 <x <60. Since 28 is excluded, but x can be exactly 28, so D is not correct. \n\nSo the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options again. \n\nOption B says 23 <x <58. The upper limit is 58, which is less than the actual max of ~59. So that's too low. \n\nOption A: 20 <x <54. Max is way too low. \n\nSo the only possible answer is C. \n\nHmm, but wait the options have E) None of these. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again the problem. The question says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\". So when n=36, x=28 exactly, which is included in C's interval (since 25 <28 <64). \n\nThe maximum x is ~59.03, which is less than 64. So the entire range is within C's interval. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me check again the simplification steps. \n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me try plugging in n=36. \n\nn=36:\n\nNumerator: 36\u00b2 +2*6*(36 +4)+16 = 1296 +2*6*40 +16.\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nFirst term: 36\u00b2 = 1296.\n\nSecond term: 2*sqrt(36)*(36 +4) = 2*6*(40) = 2*6*40 = 480.\n\nThird term: +16. So total numerator: 1296 +480 +16 = 1296+496 = 1792?\n\nWait, wait, 1296 +480 is 1776, plus 16 is 1792. \n\nDenominator: 36 +4*6 +4 =36 +24 +4=64. \n\nSo x = 1792 /64 = 28. Correct. \n\nNow, let's compute when n=72:\n\nNumerator:\n\n72\u00b2 + 2*sqrt(72)*(72+4) +16.\n\n72 squared is 5184.\n\nsqrt(72)=~8.485. \n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)*(76) =2*8.485*76. Let's compute that: \n\nFirst 8.485*2 =16.97. Then 16.97 *76. \n\n16.97 *70 =1187.9, 16.97*6=101.82. Total 1187.9 +101.82=1289.72. \n\nAdding to numerator:\n\n5184 +1289.72 =6473.72 +16 (the last term) is 6489.72. \n\nDenominator:72 +4*sqrt(72)+4 =76 +4*8.485\u224876 +33.94\u2248109.94. \n\nWait, but let me compute denominator exactly as per n=72:\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4 =72 +4*sqrt(72)+4 =76 +4*sqrt(72). \n\nSo sqrt(72)=6\u221a2. So 4*sqrt(72)=4*6\u221a2=24\u221a2. So denominator is 76 +24\u221a2. \n\nSo x = numerator / denominator. \n\nWait, but earlier when I simplified the expression, I found that x = n - 2\u221an +4. \n\nSo plugging in n=72:\n\nx =72 -2*sqrt(72)+4 =76 -2*sqrt(72). \n\nLet me compute this exactly. \n\nsqrt(72)=6\u221a2. \n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)=12\u221a2. \n\nThus x =76 -12\u221a2. \n\nCalculating numerically, 12\u221a2\u224816.97056. \n\n76-16.97056\u224859.02944, so 59.03. \n\nSo when I computed via numerator and denominator, let's see:\n\nNumerator is 72\u00b2 +2*sqrt(72)*(76)+16. \n\nWait, 72 squared is 5184. The second term is 2*sqrt(72)*(76). Let me compute exactly:\n\n2*sqrt(72)*(76) = 2*76*sqrt(72) = 152*sqrt(72). \n\nAdding the 16 gives numerator =5184 +152*sqrt(72) +16 =5200 +152*sqrt(72). \n\nDenominator is 72 +4*sqrt(72) +4 =76 +4*sqrt(72). \n\nSo x = [5200 +152\u221a72]/[76 +4\u221a72]\n\nHmm, maybe factor numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me factor numerator: 5200 +152\u221a72. Let's see:\n\nFactor 4 from numerator: 4*(1300 +38\u221a72). Not sure.\n\nDenominator: 4*(19 + \u221a72). \n\nWait, maybe let me write numerator and denominator as:\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me write denominator as 4\u221a72 +76 =4\u221a72 +76. Let me factor 4:\n\n=4(\u221a72 +19). Wait, 76 is 4*19, so yes:\n\nDenominator =4(19 +\u221a72). \n\nNumerator: 5200 +152\u221a72. Let's see if that can be written as 4*(something). 5200 is 4*1300, 152\u221a72 is 4*38\u221a72. So numerator is 4*(1300 +38\u221a72). \n\nTherefore, x = [4*(1300 +38\u221a72)] / [4*(19 +\u221a72)] = (1300 +38\u221a72)/(19 +\u221a72). \n\nHmm, perhaps factor numerator:\n\nLet me see if numerator can be written as (19 +\u221a72) multiplied by something. Let me suppose:\n\nLet me denote a=\u221a72. Then numerator is 1300 +38a. Denominator is 19 +a. \n\nLet me see if (19 +a) *k = 1300 +38a. Let's suppose k is linear in a: k = m + na. Then:\n\n(19 +a)(m + na) =19m + (19n +m)a + na\u00b2.\n\nBut a\u00b2 = (\u221a72)^2 =72. \n\nSo expanding:\n\n=19m + (19n +m)a +n*72.\n\nSet this equal to 1300 +38a. \n\nTherefore, equate coefficients:\n\nConstant term: 19m +72n =1300.\n\nCoefficient of a:19n +m =38.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1)19m +72n =1300\n\n2) m +19n =38 (from rearranging the second equation: 19n +m=38 \u2192 m=38-19n)\n\nSubstitute equation 2 into equation1:\n\n19*(38 -19n) +72n =1300\n\nCompute:\n\n19*38 =722\n\n19*(-19n)= -361n\n\nSo 722 -361n +72n =1300 \u2192722 -289n =1300\n\n\u2192 -289n =1300-722=578 \u2192 n= -578/289= -2.\n\nHmm, n would be -2, but that would make k= m +na = (38 -19*(-2)) + (-2)a \u2192 but this may not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach isn't working, so perhaps my initial simplification is correct and the numerator/denominator simplifies to x = n -2\u221an +4. \n\nSo when I calculated via that formula, got x\u224859.03. So I think that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C)25 <x <64. Because that interval includes all possible x values (28 up to ~59). \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm, the actual maximum x is ~59.03 which is less than 60. So option D's upper bound is 60, which is acceptable. The lower bound for D is 28, but the actual minimum is 28 (included). Since the problem says 36 \u2264n \u226472, when n=36, x=28 exactly. So the possible x can be 28. So the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x < ~59.03. \n\nLooking at the options, D says 28 <x <60. So it excludes the case where x=28. So if x can be exactly 28, then D is not correct. \n\nOption C includes all x between 25 and 64, which includes the entire possible range. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the inequalities as strict, but the original problem states 36 \u2264n \u226472, so x can be exactly 28. So the correct interval must include 28. Since option C includes it, but D does not, so C is the answer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the range of x given that n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. The expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it somehow.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression again to make sure I have it right:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) + 16] / [n + 4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, the numerator is n squared plus 2 times sqrt(n) times (n+4), plus 16? Or maybe the 2\u221an is multiplied by (n +4)? The way it's written could be a bit ambiguous. Let me check the original question again. Oh right, the question says \"2\u221an(n +4)\". So probably, the 2 is multiplied by sqrt(n), which is then multiplied by (n+4). So the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an*(n+4) +16. \n\nHmm, maybe the numerator is a perfect square? Let me think. Let's see: if I can write the numerator as something squared. Let's consider (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the first term is (sqrt(n))\u00b2, so a = sqrt(n). Then the middle term would need to be 2ab, so 2ab = 2*sqrt(n)*b. Comparing to the given term 2\u221an*(n+4), that suggests that b is (n+4). Wait, but then the last term would be b squared, which would be (n+4)^2. But in the numerator, the last term is 16. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (sqrt(n)^2 + something)^2? Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the denominator can be factored as a square as well. Let's check the denominator first:\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let me see: Let me set \u221an = t. Then n = t\u00b2, so denominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4. Oh! That's (t +2)^2. Because (t + 2)^2 = t\u00b2 +4t +4. So the denominator simplifies to (\u221an + 2)^2. That's helpful.\n\nNow, what about the numerator? Let me also express the numerator in terms of t where t = sqrt(n). Since n = t\u00b2, then:\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16\n\nSubstituting n = t\u00b2, that becomes:\n\n(t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (t\u00b2)^2 = t^4\n\nSecond term: 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 +8t\n\nThird term: 16.\n\nSo altogether, numerator is t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, can this be factored?\n\nHmm, let's see if it factors into something squared. Let me think again. Maybe the numerator is (t^2 + a t + b)^2? Let me try expanding that:\n\n(t^2 + a t + b)^2 = t^4 + 2a t^3 + (a\u00b2 + 2b) t\u00b2 + 2ab t + b\u00b2.\n\nComparing to our numerator: t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. The coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of t^4: 1, matches.\n\nCoefficient of t^3: 2a = 2 \u21d2 a=1.\n\nCoefficient of t^2 term: (a\u00b2 + 2b) must equal the coefficient in our numerator. But our numerator has no t\u00b2 term. So (1 + 2b) must be zero? That would mean 1 +2b=0 \u21d2 b = -0.5. But then the next terms:\n\nThe t term is 2ab t. With a=1 and b=-0.5, that would be 2*(1)*(-0.5) t = -t. But in our numerator, the t term is +8t, so that's not matching. Hmm, so that approach might not work.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (t^2 + something)(something else). Let me see:\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-calculate the numerator expression again. Wait, when I substituted n = t\u00b2, the numerator is:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16 = (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nSo expanding that: t^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2) + 2t*4 +16.\n\nWhich is t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. Wait, that's correct. So the numerator is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nHmm, perhaps grouping terms. Let me try grouping terms:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Let's see:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 can be factored as t^3(t+2). Then the remaining terms 8t +16 = 8(t +2). So altogether:\n\nt^3(t+2) +8(t+2) = (t+2)(t^3 +8).\n\nAh! That's a good step. So numerator factors into (t +2)(t^3 +8). Now, t^3 +8 is a sum of cubes, since 8 = 2^3. The formula for sum of cubes is a^3 +b^3 = (a +b)(a^2 -ab +b^2). So t^3 +8 = (t +2)(t^2 - 2t +4). Therefore, numerator becomes:\n\n(t +2)*(t +2)*(t^2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2 (t^2 -2t +4).\n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4), and the denominator is (t +2)^2. Therefore, when we divide numerator by denominator, the (t+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving us with (t^2 -2t +4).\n\nTherefore, x simplifies to t^2 -2t +4, where t = sqrt(n). \n\nSo substituting back t = sqrt(n), we have:\n\nx = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nWait, hold on. Wait a second. Let me check that again. Wait, t^2 is (sqrt(n)) squared, which is n. So yes, so substituting back, x = t\u00b2 -2t +4 = n - 2\u221an +4.\n\nHmm, that simplifies the expression a lot! So the original expression simplifies to x = n - 2\u221an +4. That's a much easier expression to work with. \n\nNow, since n is between 36 and 72, inclusive, let's see what the possible values of x can be. Let me first note that n is in [36,72], so sqrt(n) is between 6 and 8.485 (since sqrt(72) is 8.485...). \n\nSo, let's denote t = sqrt(n), so that t \u2208 [6, sqrt(72)]. Since sqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. \n\nTherefore, x = t^2 - 2t +4. Wait, but since t^2 is n, so substituting back, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of x in terms of t. Let me write x as a function of t: x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4, where t ranges from 6 to sqrt(72). \n\nWe need to find the minimum and maximum values of x(t) over this interval of t. \n\nTo find the extrema, since this is a quadratic function in terms of t, but since t is a variable here, let me see. Wait, the function x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4 is a quadratic in t, which opens upwards (since the coefficient of t\u00b2 is positive). Its vertex is at t = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1) = 1. So the vertex is at t=1, which is a minimum. But our t ranges from 6 to ~8.485, so the minimum on this interval will be at the leftmost point, t=6, and maximum at the rightmost point, t= sqrt(72). \n\nWait, let me confirm that. Since the parabola opens upwards, the vertex at t=1 is the minimum point. So for t values greater than 1, the function is increasing. Since our interval [6, sqrt(72)] is entirely to the right of the vertex, the function is increasing on this interval. Therefore, the minimum is at t=6, and maximum at t = sqrt(72). \n\nTherefore, compute x at t=6 and t= sqrt(72):\n\nFirst, at t=6:\n\nx = (6)^2 -2*(6) +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nAt t= sqrt(72). Let's compute sqrt(72). sqrt(72)= 6*sqrt(2) \u22486*1.4142\u22488.48528. But let's compute exactly:\n\nx at t = sqrt(72):\n\nx = (sqrt(72))\u00b2 -2*sqrt(72) +4 = 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4 = 76 - 2*sqrt(72).\n\nHmm, need to compute that. Let me compute 2*sqrt(72). sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2), so 2*6\u221a2 =12\u221a2. So:\n\nx =76 -12\u221a2. \n\nWait, but maybe we can compute the numerical value to see the range. Let me compute sqrt(72) first: approximately 8.48528. \n\nSo 2*sqrt(72) = 2*8.48528 \u224816.97056. \n\nTherefore, 76 -16.97056 \u224859.02944. \n\nSo x at maximum t is approximately 59.03. \n\nTherefore, the minimum x is 28, and the maximum is approximately 59.03. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. Since the maximum is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so the upper bound is okay. The lower bound is exactly 28, but the question says \"n such that 36 \u2264n \u226472\". Wait, when n is exactly 36, then sqrt(n)=6, so x is exactly 28. But the options have inequalities like \"28 < x < 60\". Wait, the question says \"satisfies\" one of the options. \n\nWait, let me check if the endpoints are included. The original problem says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So when n=36, x=28 exactly. So the possible x values are from 28 (inclusive) up to approximately 59.03 (exclusive, since n can be 72, but the upper limit of the expression when n=72 is exactly 59.03? Wait, actually when n=72, sqrt(n)=sqrt(72), so that would be exactly the maximum value. So x would be exactly 76 - 12\u221a2. Let me compute that precisely:\n\n\u221a2 is approximately 1.41421356, so 12*1.41421356 \u224816.9705627. So 76 minus that is 76-16.9705627=59.0294373. So that's approximately 59.03, which is less than 60. \n\nSo the possible x values are from 28 (inclusive) up to approximately 59.03 (so less than 60). \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says \"28 < x <60\". But the minimum x is 28, so x can be equal to 28 when n=36. Therefore, the inequality in option D is strict on the lower side. But the question says \"satisfies\" one of the options. So if the options are written with strict inequalities, then 28 is allowed, but the option D requires x>28, so that would exclude the case when x=28. Therefore, the actual possible x is 28 \u2264 x < ~59.03. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 the upper limit is too low.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 upper limit is 58, but our upper is ~59, so that's too low.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 upper is okay, but lower is okay but the lower bound here is 25 which is less than 28. Since x can be 28, so the lower bound 25 is okay, but the problem is the upper bound. Wait, no, the upper bound of 64 is higher than 59, so the upper limit would be okay. Wait, but the question is which of the options the x satisfies. The actual maximum x is ~59, so 64 is higher, so the upper part is okay. But the lower bound here is 25, which is lower than 28, so the interval 25 <x <64 would include all x from 28 up, so that's true. But the options are asking which one is correct. Wait but let me check other options.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 the lower bound is strict. Since x can be exactly 28, then the interval 28 <x would exclude that case. So the correct interval would include 28 as a possible value, so D's lower bound is not correct.\n\nE) None of these. \n\nHmm, so the correct range is 28 \u2264x < ~59.03. So looking at the options:\n\nOption C says 25 <x <64. Since 25 is less than 28, and 64 is higher than the upper limit, the actual x values lie entirely within this interval. So option C's range includes all possible x values. \n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"satisfies\". The options are ranges that x must lie within. So if the possible x values are between 28 and ~59.03, then any x in that interval must lie within the given options' ranges. So let's see which options include all possible x:\n\nOption C: 25 to 64. Since all x between 28 and 59 are within 25-64. So yes, that's true. \n\nOption D: 28 to 60. Since the maximum is ~59, which is less than 60, so the interval would be 28 to ~59. So the lower bound is exactly 28 (but D says 28 <x, so x can't be 28). The upper bound is okay. So the actual x values are from 28 up to ~59. So D's interval is (28, 60), which excludes the minimum point (when x=28). Therefore, the correct answer must include x=28, so D is not correct. \n\nOption C includes x=28 (since 25 <28 <64). Therefore, the correct answer would be C?\n\nWait, but let me check the other options again. \n\nOption B: 23 <x <58. The upper limit is 58, which is less than 59, so the upper part is too low. So the maximum x is ~59, which is outside of B's upper limit, so B is incorrect.\n\nOption D's upper limit is 60, which is okay, but lower is strict. \n\nOption A's upper is 54, which is way too low. \n\nSo between C and D. The problem is whether the options are strict inequalities. The question says \"satisfies\" which of the options. \n\nThe original expression: when n=36, x=28 exactly. So x can be equal to 28, so the correct interval must include 28 as a possible value. So any option that has x>28 would exclude that, so D is out. Option C says 25 <x <64, which includes 28. \n\nSimilarly, the maximum value is ~59.03, which is less than 64, so that's okay. So the entire range of x is within C's interval. So the answer would be C?\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a mistake in my calculations. Because the options given include D (28 <x <60). Since the maximum x is ~59.03, which is less than 60, so the maximum is within D's upper limit. But D requires x>28, but since x can be exactly 28, that's not included in D. So the correct interval would be [28, ~59.03). \n\nSo the only option that includes all possible x is C (25 <x <64). Because even if the lower bound of C is 25, which is lower than the actual minimum of 28, but since all x's are above 25, that's okay. Similarly, the upper bound is 64, which is higher than needed. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C. Wait, but let me double-check the problem again. \n\nWait, let me re-calculate the maximum x when n=72. Let me compute that again:\n\nx = n -2\u221an +4.\n\nAt n=72:\n\nx =72 -2*sqrt(72)+4.\n\nsqrt(72)= 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485281374.\n\nSo 2*sqrt(72) is about 16.97056275.\n\n72 +4 =76. So 76 -16.97056275 = 59.02943725. So approximately 59.03.\n\nTherefore, the maximum x is approximately 59.03, which is less than 60. So D's upper limit of 60 is okay, but the lower limit is 28, but since x can be exactly 28, D's inequality is 28 <x <60, which would exclude x=28. So the correct interval must include x=28, so the only option that includes 28 is option C (since 25 <x <64 includes 28). \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C?\n\nWait, but let me check if any of the other options might have a better fit. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nC)25 <x <64. The lower bound is 25. Since the minimum x is 28, which is greater than 25, so that's okay. The upper is 64, which is higher than the actual max. So the entire x's values are within C. \n\nD)28 <x <60. The lower bound is too strict (excludes x=28), but the upper is okay. \n\nSo since the question is asking which of the options is correct, and the actual x can be 28, which is not included in D, but included in C, so C is the correct answer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification step. Let me double-check the algebra again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me substitute n = t\u00b2 again, so t = sqrt(n). Then:\n\nNumerator: (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator: t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nThen, numerator was factored as (t+2)(t^3 +8) = (t+2)(t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2-2t+4). \n\nTherefore, numerator divided by denominator is (t^2 -2t +4). \n\nWait, but substituting back, that's x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is sqrt(n), so t\u00b2 is n, so x = n - 2t +4 = n -2\u221an +4. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nWait, but when I calculated x at t=6 (n=36), that gives x= 36 - 12 +4 =28. \n\nAt n=72, x=72 -2*sqrt(72)+4 \u224859.03. \n\nTherefore, the range is from 28 to ~59.03. \n\nSo the possible x is between 28 and ~59.03. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nC)25 <x <64. Since 28 is greater than 25, and 59.03 is less than 64, so the entire interval is within C. \n\nD)28 <x <60. Since 28 is excluded, but x can be exactly 28, so D is not correct. \n\nSo the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the other options again. \n\nOption B says 23 <x <58. The upper limit is 58, which is less than the actual max of ~59. So that's too low. \n\nOption A: 20 <x <54. Max is way too low. \n\nSo the only possible answer is C. \n\nHmm, but wait the options have E) None of these. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again the problem. The question says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\". So when n=36, x=28 exactly, which is included in C's interval (since 25 <28 <64). \n\nThe maximum x is ~59.03, which is less than 64. So the entire range is within C's interval. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me check again the simplification steps. \n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me try plugging in n=36. \n\nn=36:\n\nNumerator: 36\u00b2 +2*6*(36 +4)+16 = 1296 +2*6*40 +16.\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nFirst term: 36\u00b2 = 1296.\n\nSecond term: 2*sqrt(36)*(36 +4) = 2*6*(40) = 2*6*40 = 480.\n\nThird term: +16. So total numerator: 1296 +480 +16 = 1296+496 = 1792?\n\nWait, wait, 1296 +480 is 1776, plus 16 is 1792. \n\nDenominator: 36 +4*6 +4 =36 +24 +4=64. \n\nSo x = 1792 /64 = 28. Correct. \n\nNow, let's compute when n=72:\n\nNumerator:\n\n72\u00b2 + 2*sqrt(72)*(72+4) +16.\n\n72 squared is 5184.\n\nsqrt(72)=~8.485. \n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)*(76) =2*8.485*76. Let's compute that: \n\nFirst 8.485*2 =16.97. Then 16.97 *76. \n\n16.97 *70 =1187.9, 16.97*6=101.82. Total 1187.9 +101.82=1289.72. \n\nAdding to numerator:\n\n5184 +1289.72 =6473.72 +16 (the last term) is 6489.72. \n\nDenominator:72 +4*sqrt(72)+4 =76 +4*8.485\u224876 +33.94\u2248109.94. \n\nWait, but let me compute denominator exactly as per n=72:\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4 =72 +4*sqrt(72)+4 =76 +4*sqrt(72). \n\nSo sqrt(72)=6\u221a2. So 4*sqrt(72)=4*6\u221a2=24\u221a2. So denominator is 76 +24\u221a2. \n\nSo x = numerator / denominator. \n\nWait, but earlier when I simplified the expression, I found that x = n - 2\u221an +4. \n\nSo plugging in n=72:\n\nx =72 -2*sqrt(72)+4 =76 -2*sqrt(72). \n\nLet me compute this exactly. \n\nsqrt(72)=6\u221a2. \n\nSo 2*sqrt(72)=12\u221a2. \n\nThus x =76 -12\u221a2. \n\nCalculating numerically, 12\u221a2\u224816.97056. \n\n76-16.97056\u224859.02944, so 59.03. \n\nSo when I computed via numerator and denominator, let's see:\n\nNumerator is 72\u00b2 +2*sqrt(72)*(76)+16. \n\nWait, 72 squared is 5184. The second term is 2*sqrt(72)*(76). Let me compute exactly:\n\n2*sqrt(72)*(76) = 2*76*sqrt(72) = 152*sqrt(72). \n\nAdding the 16 gives numerator =5184 +152*sqrt(72) +16 =5200 +152*sqrt(72). \n\nDenominator is 72 +4*sqrt(72) +4 =76 +4*sqrt(72). \n\nSo x = [5200 +152\u221a72]/[76 +4\u221a72]\n\nHmm, maybe factor numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me factor numerator: 5200 +152\u221a72. Let's see:\n\nFactor 4 from numerator: 4*(1300 +38\u221a72). Not sure.\n\nDenominator: 4*(19 + \u221a72). \n\nWait, maybe let me write numerator and denominator as:\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me write denominator as 4\u221a72 +76 =4\u221a72 +76. Let me factor 4:\n\n=4(\u221a72 +19). Wait, 76 is 4*19, so yes:\n\nDenominator =4(19 +\u221a72). \n\nNumerator: 5200 +152\u221a72. Let's see if that can be written as 4*(something). 5200 is 4*1300, 152\u221a72 is 4*38\u221a72. So numerator is 4*(1300 +38\u221a72). \n\nTherefore, x = [4*(1300 +38\u221a72)] / [4*(19 +\u221a72)] = (1300 +38\u221a72)/(19 +\u221a72). \n\nHmm, perhaps factor numerator:\n\nLet me see if numerator can be written as (19 +\u221a72) multiplied by something. Let me suppose:\n\nLet me denote a=\u221a72. Then numerator is 1300 +38a. Denominator is 19 +a. \n\nLet me see if (19 +a) *k = 1300 +38a. Let's suppose k is linear in a: k = m + na. Then:\n\n(19 +a)(m + na) =19m + (19n +m)a + na\u00b2.\n\nBut a\u00b2 = (\u221a72)^2 =72. \n\nSo expanding:\n\n=19m + (19n +m)a +n*72.\n\nSet this equal to 1300 +38a. \n\nTherefore, equate coefficients:\n\nConstant term: 19m +72n =1300.\n\nCoefficient of a:19n +m =38.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1)19m +72n =1300\n\n2) m +19n =38 (from rearranging the second equation: 19n +m=38 \u2192 m=38-19n)\n\nSubstitute equation 2 into equation1:\n\n19*(38 -19n) +72n =1300\n\nCompute:\n\n19*38 =722\n\n19*(-19n)= -361n\n\nSo 722 -361n +72n =1300 \u2192722 -289n =1300\n\n\u2192 -289n =1300-722=578 \u2192 n= -578/289= -2.\n\nHmm, n would be -2, but that would make k= m +na = (38 -19*(-2)) + (-2)a \u2192 but this may not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach isn't working, so perhaps my initial simplification is correct and the numerator/denominator simplifies to x = n -2\u221an +4. \n\nSo when I calculated via that formula, got x\u224859.03. So I think that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C)25 <x <64. Because that interval includes all possible x values (28 up to ~59). \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm, the actual maximum x is ~59.03 which is less than 60. So option D's upper bound is 60, which is acceptable. The lower bound for D is 28, but the actual minimum is 28 (included). Since the problem says 36 \u2264n \u226472, when n=36, x=28 exactly. So the possible x can be 28. So the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x < ~59.03. \n\nLooking at the options, D says 28 <x <60. So it excludes the case where x=28. So if x can be exactly 28, then D is not correct. \n\nOption C includes all x between 25 and 64, which includes the entire possible range. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers the inequalities as strict, but the original problem states 36 \u2264n \u226472, so x can be exactly 28. So the correct interval must include 28. Since option C includes it, but D does not, so C is the answer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option C.\n\n\nThe given expression for \\( x \\) simplifies significantly by substituting \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\). This transforms the numerator and denominator into expressions that can be factored, leading to the simplified form \\( x = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\). \n\nFor \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) ranges from 6 to \\( \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485 \\). Evaluating \\( x \\) at the boundaries:\n- When \\( n = 36 \\), \\( x = 36 - 2(6) + 4 = 28 \\).\n- When \\( n = 72 \\), \\( x \\approx 72 - 2(8.485) + 4 \\approx 59.03 \\).\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from 28 (inclusive) to approximately 59.03 (exclusive). Among the options, **C) 25 < x < 64** is the only interval that fully contains this range. Option D) excludes the minimum value of 28, while other options have upper or lower bounds that are too restrictive. \n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find out which interval x falls into, given that n is between 36 and 72. The expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify it step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I can rewrite the numerator and the denominator to see if there's a way to factor them or simplify the fraction. Let me look at the numerator: n squared plus 2 times sqrt(n) times (n +4) plus 16. Wait, maybe that's a perfect square? Like, if I think of something squared equals (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Let me see:\n\nLet me see the terms. Let's denote a = sqrt(n), then the numerator would be (sqrt(n))\u2074 + 2*sqrt(n)*(n +4) + 16. Wait, maybe that's not the right substitution. Alternatively, maybe the numerator can be written as (sqrt(n)^2 + something)^2?\n\nWait, let me think again. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Hmm, maybe I can rearrange terms. Let's see:\n\nWait, n squared is (sqrt(n))^4, but maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, maybe the numerator is (sqrt(n^2) + something squared). Hmm, perhaps I need to see if the numerator can be expressed as a square of a binomial. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the numerator is (sqrt(n^2) + ... ), but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps if I let a = sqrt(n), then the numerator becomes a^4 + 2a(n +4) +16. Wait, but n is a^2 here. Wait, substituting a = sqrt(n), then n = a\u00b2. So substituting into the numerator:\n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16 = (a\u00b2)^2 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16\n\nLet me compute that: a^4 + 2a(a\u00b2 +4) +16 = a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, not sure if that factors into something. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again:\n\nWait, 2\u221an*(n +4) would be 2a*(a\u00b2 +4). So yes, that's right. Hmm, so numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Not obvious. Maybe the denominator can be written as (sqrt(n) + something)^2?\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let's see: n is (sqrt(n))\u00b2, so that's a\u00b2 +4a +4, which factors as (a +2)^2. Oh! That's a perfect square. So denominator is (sqrt(n) +2)^2. That's helpful.\n\nSo denominator is (sqrt(n) +2)^2. Now the numerator, maybe it's also a square?\n\nWait, let's try again to see the numerator. Let me write the numerator again:\n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. Wait, let me expand the middle term: 2\u221an *n is 2n^(3/2), and 2\u221an *4 is 8\u221an. So the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. Hmm, not sure. Let me see if this can be expressed as (n + something)^2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the numerator as (sqrt(n^2) + ... ) but that might not work. Alternatively, perhaps (n + 2\u221an + something)^2? Let me see:\n\nWait, let me think of the numerator again in terms of a substitution. Let me set a = sqrt(n). So n = a\u00b2. Then the numerator is (a\u00b2)^2 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16 = a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, is this a perfect square?\n\nSuppose I try to write this as (a\u00b2 + m a + p)^2. Let's see:\n\nExpanding (a\u00b2 + m a + p)^2 = a^4 + 2ma\u00b3 + (m\u00b2 + 2p)a\u00b2 + 2mp a + p\u00b2. Comparing to numerator terms:\n\nWe have numerator: a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16. So, coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of a^4: 1, matches.\n\nCoefficient of a^3: 2m must equal 2 \u2192 m =1.\n\nCoefficient of a^2: (m\u00b2 + 2p) must equal the coefficient of a\u00b2 in the numerator. But in the numerator, there's no a\u00b2 term. So m\u00b2 +2p =0. Since m=1, that gives 1 + 2p =0 \u2192 p = -0.5.\n\nCoefficient of a term: 2mp must equal 8. Plugging m=1 and p=-0.5 gives 2*(1)*(-0.5) = -1, which should equal 8? That's not possible. Hmm, so that approach doesn't work. Maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square of a quadratic. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (n + 2\u221an + 4)^2? Let me check that:\n\n(n +2\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 +4\u221an*n + 4n +4n\u221an + ... Wait, expanding step by step:\n\nWait, (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. Let me set a = n, b = 2\u221an, c=4. Wait no, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is (sqrt(n^2) + 2 sqrt(n) +4)^2? Wait, sqrt(n^2) is n, so that would be (n + 2\u221an +4)^2. Let me compute that:\n\n(n + 2\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 + (2\u221an)^2 +4\u00b2 + 2*n*(2\u221an) + 2*n*4 + 2*(2\u221an)*4.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nn\u00b2 + (4n) + 16 + 4n^(3/2) + 8n + 16\u221an.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nn\u00b2 + (4n +8n) = 12n, plus 16, plus 4n^(3/2) +16\u221an. Hmm, that's n\u00b2 +12n +16 +4n^(3/2) +16\u221an. Which is different from the numerator which was n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. So that's not matching. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm going the wrong way here. Let me think again. The expression for x is [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]. Since the denominator is (sqrt(n)+2)^2, maybe the numerator can be written as (sqrt(n^2) + something)^2, but perhaps I need another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator in a different way. Let me see:\n\nWait, let me try to write the numerator as (n + 2\u221an *2 + something)^2. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (sqrt(n^2 + ... )) but that might not help. Wait, maybe instead of trying to factor, I can perform polynomial division or see if the numerator is divisible by the denominator.\n\nLet me think of the numerator and denominator in terms of a substitution. Let me let t = sqrt(n). Then n = t\u00b2, so substituting into the expression:\n\nNumerator becomes (t^4) + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16. Let me compute that:\n\nt^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator is t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t +2)^2.\n\nSo x = [t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16] / (t +2)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can perform polynomial division here. Let me see if the numerator can be divided by (t +2)^2.\n\nLet me try to factor the numerator:\n\nLet me see if (t +2) is a factor of the numerator. Let me plug t = -2 into the numerator to check. But t is sqrt(n), which is positive, so t can't be -2, but just to check if (t+2) is a factor:\n\nCompute numerator at t = -2: (-2)^4 +2*(-2)^3 +8*(-2) +16 = 16 -16 -16 +16 = 0. Oh! It equals zero. So (t +2) is a factor. Let me perform the division.\n\nDivide numerator by (t+2):\n\nLet me write numerator as t^4 + 2t^3 + 0t^2 +8t +16. Divided by (t+2).\n\nUsing polynomial long division:\n\nDivide t^4 by t \u2192 t^3. Multiply (t+2) by t^3 \u2192 t^4 +2t^3. Subtract from numerator: (t^4 +2t^3 +0t^2 +8t +16) - (t^4 +2t^3) = 0t^4 +0t^3 +0t^2 +8t +16.\n\nNow, the remainder is 0t^3 +0t^2 +8t +16. Wait, but that leaves us with 8t +16. Hmm, but the remaining term is degree 1, but the divisor is degree 1, so we can continue:\n\nDivide 8t by t \u2192 8. Multiply (t+2) by 8 \u21928t +16. Subtract: (8t +16) - (8t +16) =0. So the numerator factors as (t+2)(t^3 +0t^2 +0t +8) \u2192 (t+2)(t^3 +8).\n\nWait, but t^3 +8 can be factored as (t +2)(t^2 -2t +4). Because a^3 + b^3 = (a +b)(a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2). Here, 8 is 2^3, so t^3 +8 = (t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nTherefore, the numerator is (t+2)*(t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). \n\nTherefore, the numerator is (t +2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). The denominator is (t+2)^2. So when we divide numerator by denominator, the (t+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nOh! That simplifies things a lot. So x simplifies to t\u00b2 - 2t +4, where t is sqrt(n). Since t = sqrt(n), then t\u00b2 is n. Wait, so substituting back:\n\nWait, t is sqrt(n), so t\u00b2 = n, so x = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4 \u2192 x = n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, no, wait, hold on. Wait, I think I messed up here.\n\nWait, let's go back. The numerator was (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). The denominator is (t+2)^2. So when we divide them, we get (t\u00b2 -2t +4). But t is sqrt(n). So substituting back, x = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 -2*sqrt(n) +4? Wait, no, wait: (t\u00b2 - 2t +4). Since t is sqrt(n), then t squared is n. So t squared minus 2t plus 4 would be n - 2*sqrt(n) +4. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because in the numerator's factorization, after dividing by denominator, we get (t\u00b2 -2t +4). Since t is sqrt(n), so t squared is n. So yes, x = n - 2*sqrt(n) +4.\n\nWait, but that seems like a big simplification. Let me confirm that again. Let me retrace:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWe set t = sqrt(n), so n = t\u00b2. The numerator becomes t^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t +16. The denominator is t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nFactoring numerator: as above, we found that numerator factors into (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). Therefore, dividing by denominator (t+2)^2 gives x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is sqrt(n), substituting back gives:\n\nx = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4 \u2192 which is n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, that's correct. So x simplifies to x = n - 2\u221an +4. That's a much simpler expression!\n\nSo now, instead of dealing with the original complicated fraction, I can just work with x = n - 2\u221an +4. Now, since n is between 36 and 72, I need to find the possible values of x in that interval.\n\nLet me write x as a function of n: x(n) = n - 2\u221an +4. To find the range of x when n is between 36 and 72, I can analyze this function.\n\nFirst, let's compute x at the endpoints of the interval for n. Since n is between 36 and 72, inclusive, we can compute x when n=36 and n=72. Also, since this is a continuous function, the minimum and maximum will be at the endpoints or at critical points. Let's check if the function has any critical points (i.e., where its derivative is zero) in the interval.\n\nFirst, compute the derivative of x with respect to n:\n\ndx/dn = d/dn [n -2\u221an +4] = 1 - 2*(1/(2\u221an)) +0 = 1 - 1/\u221an.\n\nSet derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n\n1 - 1/\u221an =0 \u2192 1 = 1/\u221an \u2192 \u221an =1 \u2192 n=1.\n\nBut n is between 36 and72, so the critical point at n=1 is outside the interval. Therefore, the function is either increasing or decreasing throughout the interval. Let's check the sign of the derivative in the interval:\n\nTake n=36, then \u221an=6, so 1/\u221an =1/6 \u22480.1667. Thus, dx/dn =1 -0.1667 \u22480.833>0. Similarly, at n=72, \u221an \u22488.485, so 1/\u221an \u22480.1178, so dx/dn \u22481 -0.1178\u22480.882>0. So the derivative is always positive in the interval. Therefore, x is an increasing function of n on [36,72]. Therefore, the minimum x is at n=36 and maximum at n=72.\n\nTherefore, compute x at n=36 and n=72:\n\nFirst, n=36:\n\nx =36 -2*sqrt(36) +4 = 36 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nWait, that's exactly 28. Hmm, but let me check again:\n\nsqrt(36) is 6, so 2*6 is 12. So 36 -12 is 24, plus 4 is 28. Yep.\n\nNow n=72:\n\nsqrt(72) is sqrt(36*2) =6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. So 2*sqrt(72) \u22482*8.485\u224816.97.\n\nThus x =72 -16.97 +4 \u224872 -16.97 is 55.03, plus 4 is 59.03. So approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, let me compute more precisely:\n\nsqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2). So exactly, 2*sqrt(72)=12*sqrt(2). So exact value would be 72 -12\u221a2 +4. But let's see:\n\nWait, 12\u221a2 is approximately 12*1.4142 \u224816.9704. So 72 -16.9704 =55.0296 +4 is 59.0296. So approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the minimum x is 28 when n=36, and the maximum is approximately 59.03 when n=72. But since the options given have intervals like 28<x<60 (option D), 25<x<64 (C), etc. Wait, let's look at the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)20 < x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm, the minimum is exactly 28, so the lower bound must be less than or equal to 28? Wait, but the options have inequalities as strict. So if the minimum is exactly 28, then 28 <x would not include it. Wait, but the original problem says 36 \u2264 n \u226472. So when n=36, x is exactly 28. The question says \"satisfies\", so if the options are ranges that must include all possible x, then the lower bound must be less than or equal to 28. But the options given for D is 28 <x <60. Since x can be 28, then that interval would not include 28. So the correct interval would need to have lower bound less than or equal to 28. Looking at the options, option D's lower bound is 28 <x, which excludes 28, but since n can be 36 (which gives x=28), the correct interval must include 28. So none of the options except perhaps E?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me confirm the calculation for n=36 again:\n\nx =36 - 2*6 +4 \u2192 36-12=24; 24+4=28. Exactly 28. So the minimum x is 28, and maximum is approximately 59.03. So the possible x ranges from 28 (inclusive) up to approximately 59.03 (exclusive, since n can be up to 72, which is included). Wait, but n is up to 72, so when n=72, x is exactly 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4. Let me compute sqrt(72) exactly. sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2). So 2*sqrt(72)=12*sqrt(2). Therefore, x at n=72 is 72 +4 -12\u221a2 =76 -12\u221a2. Since sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, so 12*1.4142\u224816.9704. So 76 -16.9704\u224859.0296. So the maximum x is approximately 59.03, which is less than 60. So the maximum x is just under 60, but not reaching 60.\n\nTherefore, the actual range is 28 \u2264 x < ~59.03. So the lower bound is exactly 28, and upper is just under 60. So the interval would be 28 \u2264x <60. But the options given are:\n\nD)28 <x <60: This excludes 28 and includes up to but not including 60. Since x can be exactly 28, which is not included in D's interval, so D is not correct. The next option, C is 25 <x <64. Since 25 is lower than 28, and upper is higher, so 28 is within the lower part, and the upper is higher than 59.03, so that interval would include all possible x. But the problem says \"satisfies\" which of the options. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the question says \"If 36 \u2264n \u226472, then x= ... satisfies\". The options are ranges that x must lie in. Since x can be exactly 28 (when n=36), and the options are all inequalities with strict inequalities. So the correct interval must include 28 and 59.03. Let me check each option:\n\nA)20 <x <54: The upper limit is 54, but x can be up to ~59, so this is too low. So A is wrong.\n\nB)23 <x <58: Upper limit is 58, which is less than ~59, so also too low. So B is wrong.\n\nC)25 <x <64: Lower limit is 25, which is less than 28. Upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59.03. So this interval includes all possible x. So C's range is from 25 to 64, which would include 28 to ~59, so yes, x is within that interval. But wait, the question is which of the options is correct. But let me check D again.\n\nD)28 <x <60: This excludes the lower bound 28, so since x can be exactly 28, then D is not correct. So the only option that includes all possible x is C. But wait, the problem says \"satisfies\" \u2014 does that mean that all x must lie strictly within the given interval? For example, if the actual x can be exactly 28, then the interval must include 28. But the options are written with strict inequalities. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. So 25 is less than 28, so 28 is included. Similarly, the upper is 64, which is above the maximum. So all x from 28 to ~59 are between 25 and 64, so C is correct. But D is 28 <x <60, which excludes the lower end. But the problem states that n can be 36, so x can be exactly 28. Since the inequality is strict, 28 is not included. Therefore, the correct interval must include 28. So C is the only one that includes all possible x.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C says \"25 <x <64\". The lower bound is 25, which is less than 28, so all x are above 25. The upper bound is 64, which is higher than 59.03, so all x are below 64. Therefore, all x satisfy 25 <x <64. Therefore, the correct answer is C. But wait, let me check the maximum again. The maximum x is approximately 59.03, so it's under 60. So even option D's upper limit is 60. So the maximum x is less than 60, so the maximum is under 60, so D's upper limit is okay. So for D, the interval is 28 <x <60. But since the lower bound is 28 (excluded), but x can be 28, which is not in D's interval, so D is invalid. So C is the correct answer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me confirm the maximum again.\n\nWait, when n=72, x =72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4. Let me compute sqrt(72) precisely:\n\nsqrt(72)= 8.48528137423857. So 2*sqrt(72)=16.97056274847714. \n\nThen 72 -16.97056274847714 = 55.02943725152286. Then adding 4 gives 59.02943725152286. So approximately 59.03. So that's less than 60, so the upper bound is indeed under 60. So the interval would be 28 \u2264x < ~59.03. So the maximum x is less than 60, so the upper limit for D's interval is 60, which is okay. But the lower bound of D is 28, but x can be exactly 28, so 28 is not in D's interval. Therefore, the only option that includes all possible x (including 28) is C, since it starts at 25. \n\nAlternatively, if the question allows the endpoints, but the options have strict inequalities, then perhaps none of them is correct. Wait, but the problem states \"36 \u2264n \u226472\", so n can be 36 and 72. Then x can be exactly 28 and approximately 59.03. The options have strict inequalities. So for example, option C's lower bound is 25 <x, so 28 is okay. The upper bound is <64, which is okay. So all x satisfy 25 <x <64, so C is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check option D again. The upper limit is 60, which is higher than 59.03, so that's okay. The problem is the lower limit. Since x can be exactly 28, but D requires x>28. So 28 is not in D. But in C, x has to be greater than 25, which is true. So C is valid. So the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but hold on. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nSo between these two, C is a larger interval that includes all possible x. But the problem says \"satisfies\", so which is the tightest interval that includes all possible x? The question is probably looking for the minimal interval that covers all possible x. Since the minimal interval would be 28 to ~59.03, so between 28 and 60, but D's lower bound is strict. But since x can be exactly 28, D is not correct. The only option that includes all x is C. So the answer is C?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me double-check the simplification steps again.\n\nOriginal expression: [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me take n=36 and plug into original expression to see if x is indeed 28.\n\nNumerator: 36\u00b2 + 2*sqrt(36)*(36 +4) +16 = 1296 + 2*6*(40) +16 = 1296 + 480 +16 = 1296+496=1792?\n\nWait, 2*6 is 12, 12*40 is 480. 1296 +480 is 1776, plus 16 is 1792.\n\nDenominator: 36 +4*6 +4 =36 +24 +4=64.\n\nSo x =1792 /64 = 28. Correct. So that's right.\n\nAnother test: n=49 (which is 7\u00b2). Let me compute x both ways.\n\nFirst via the simplified formula: x =49 - 2*7 +4 =49-14+4=39.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nNumerator:49\u00b2 +2*sqrt(49)*(49+4) +16 =2401 +2*7*(53)+16 =2401 + 742 +16=2401+758=3159?\n\nWait 2*7 is 14, 14*53 is 742. 2401 +742 =3143 +16=3159.\n\nDenominator:49 +4*7 +4 =49+28+4=81.\n\n3159/81 = 39. Correct. So the simplification is correct.\n\nAnother test: n=16 (but wait n has to be between 36 and 72, but just for testing). Let's see.\n\nWait n=16 would be outside the given range, but let's try.\n\nx simplified would be 16 - 8 +4 =12. Original expression:\n\nNumerator:16\u00b2 +2*4*(20) +16 =256 +160 +16=432.\n\nDenominator:16+8+4=28. 432/28= 15.428..., but simplified gives 12. Wait that's different. Wait, so that inconsistency suggests that my simplification is wrong?\n\nWait, wait a second. Wait n=16, so t=4. Then numerator is t^4 +2t*(t\u00b2+4) +16. Let's compute:\n\nt=4: numerator is 256 +2*4*(16+4) +16 =256 +2*4*20 +16 =256 +160 +16 =432. Denominator is (t+2)^2=6\u00b2=36. 432/36=12. Which matches the simplified x= t\u00b2-2t+4 \u2192 16-8+4=12. So that's correct. So the simplification holds. The problem is when I did denominator for n=16, 16 +4*4 +4=16+16+4=36. So that's correct. So my simplification is correct.\n\nSo returning, the simplification is correct. Therefore, the analysis holds. Thus, the correct interval is between 28 and ~59.03, so the only option that covers this entirely is option C (25 to 64), since 25 is less than 28, and 64 is more than 59.03. Option D's upper limit is 60, which is also acceptable, but its lower limit is 28, which excludes the point at n=36. So between C and D, which is correct?\n\nThe question is asking which interval x satisfies. Since x can be exactly 28 (when n=36), the interval must include 28. Option C's lower bound is 25, so 28 is within. Option D's lower bound is 28, which is not included. So the only option that includes all possible x is C. So the answer must be C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again:\n\nOption C says \"25 <x <64\". Since the maximum x is ~59.03, which is less than 64, and the minimum is 28, which is greater than 25, so yes, all x are in that interval. So C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the question had said \"must be contained within which interval\", then C is correct. But perhaps the question is looking for the tightest interval? But the options don't have a tighter one except D, which excludes the lower bound. But since x can be exactly 28, D is not correct. Therefore, the answer must be C. So the correct option is C.\n\nWait but looking at the options again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)20 < x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm, so since the actual minimum is 28, which is exactly the lower bound of D but not included, and the upper bound of D is 60 which is more than enough, but since the lower bound is strict, D is invalid. So the only option that works is C. So the answer is C. But wait, let me check the upper limit again. The maximum x is about 59.03, so the upper limit of D is 60, which is higher than that. So the interval in D would include all x except the lower bound. But since x can be exactly 28, which is excluded by D, then D is not correct. Therefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"satisfies\". The question is, does the value of x for all n in [36,72] lie strictly between 25 and 64? Since 25 is less than 28, and 64 is greater than 59.03, yes, so all x are in that interval. So option C is correct. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find out which interval x falls into, given that n is between 36 and 72. The expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify it step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I can rewrite the numerator and the denominator to see if there's a way to factor them or simplify the fraction. Let me look at the numerator: n squared plus 2 times sqrt(n) times (n +4) plus 16. Wait, maybe that's a perfect square? Like, if I think of something squared equals (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Let me see:\n\nLet me see the terms. Let's denote a = sqrt(n), then the numerator would be (sqrt(n))\u2074 + 2*sqrt(n)*(n +4) + 16. Wait, maybe that's not the right substitution. Alternatively, maybe the numerator can be written as (sqrt(n)^2 + something)^2?\n\nWait, let me think again. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Hmm, maybe I can rearrange terms. Let's see:\n\nWait, n squared is (sqrt(n))^4, but maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, maybe the numerator is (sqrt(n^2) + something squared). Hmm, perhaps I need to see if the numerator can be expressed as a square of a binomial. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the numerator is (sqrt(n^2) + ... ), but that might not help. Alternatively, perhaps if I let a = sqrt(n), then the numerator becomes a^4 + 2a(n +4) +16. Wait, but n is a^2 here. Wait, substituting a = sqrt(n), then n = a\u00b2. So substituting into the numerator:\n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16 = (a\u00b2)^2 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16\n\nLet me compute that: a^4 + 2a(a\u00b2 +4) +16 = a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, not sure if that factors into something. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again:\n\nWait, 2\u221an*(n +4) would be 2a*(a\u00b2 +4). So yes, that's right. Hmm, so numerator is a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Not obvious. Maybe the denominator can be written as (sqrt(n) + something)^2?\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let's see: n is (sqrt(n))\u00b2, so that's a\u00b2 +4a +4, which factors as (a +2)^2. Oh! That's a perfect square. So denominator is (sqrt(n) +2)^2. That's helpful.\n\nSo denominator is (sqrt(n) +2)^2. Now the numerator, maybe it's also a square?\n\nWait, let's try again to see the numerator. Let me write the numerator again:\n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. Wait, let me expand the middle term: 2\u221an *n is 2n^(3/2), and 2\u221an *4 is 8\u221an. So the numerator becomes n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. Hmm, not sure. Let me see if this can be expressed as (n + something)^2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the numerator as (sqrt(n^2) + ... ) but that might not work. Alternatively, perhaps (n + 2\u221an + something)^2? Let me see:\n\nWait, let me think of the numerator again in terms of a substitution. Let me set a = sqrt(n). So n = a\u00b2. Then the numerator is (a\u00b2)^2 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16 = a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, is this a perfect square?\n\nSuppose I try to write this as (a\u00b2 + m a + p)^2. Let's see:\n\nExpanding (a\u00b2 + m a + p)^2 = a^4 + 2ma\u00b3 + (m\u00b2 + 2p)a\u00b2 + 2mp a + p\u00b2. Comparing to numerator terms:\n\nWe have numerator: a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16. So, coefficients:\n\nCoefficient of a^4: 1, matches.\n\nCoefficient of a^3: 2m must equal 2 \u2192 m =1.\n\nCoefficient of a^2: (m\u00b2 + 2p) must equal the coefficient of a\u00b2 in the numerator. But in the numerator, there's no a\u00b2 term. So m\u00b2 +2p =0. Since m=1, that gives 1 + 2p =0 \u2192 p = -0.5.\n\nCoefficient of a term: 2mp must equal 8. Plugging m=1 and p=-0.5 gives 2*(1)*(-0.5) = -1, which should equal 8? That's not possible. Hmm, so that approach doesn't work. Maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square of a quadratic. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (n + 2\u221an + 4)^2? Let me check that:\n\n(n +2\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 +4\u221an*n + 4n +4n\u221an + ... Wait, expanding step by step:\n\nWait, (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc. Let me set a = n, b = 2\u221an, c=4. Wait no, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is (sqrt(n^2) + 2 sqrt(n) +4)^2? Wait, sqrt(n^2) is n, so that would be (n + 2\u221an +4)^2. Let me compute that:\n\n(n + 2\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 + (2\u221an)^2 +4\u00b2 + 2*n*(2\u221an) + 2*n*4 + 2*(2\u221an)*4.\n\nCalculating each term:\n\nn\u00b2 + (4n) + 16 + 4n^(3/2) + 8n + 16\u221an.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nn\u00b2 + (4n +8n) = 12n, plus 16, plus 4n^(3/2) +16\u221an. Hmm, that's n\u00b2 +12n +16 +4n^(3/2) +16\u221an. Which is different from the numerator which was n\u00b2 + 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an +16. So that's not matching. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm going the wrong way here. Let me think again. The expression for x is [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]. Since the denominator is (sqrt(n)+2)^2, maybe the numerator can be written as (sqrt(n^2) + something)^2, but perhaps I need another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator in a different way. Let me see:\n\nWait, let me try to write the numerator as (n + 2\u221an *2 + something)^2. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (sqrt(n^2 + ... )) but that might not help. Wait, maybe instead of trying to factor, I can perform polynomial division or see if the numerator is divisible by the denominator.\n\nLet me think of the numerator and denominator in terms of a substitution. Let me let t = sqrt(n). Then n = t\u00b2, so substituting into the expression:\n\nNumerator becomes (t^4) + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16. Let me compute that:\n\nt^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator is t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t +2)^2.\n\nSo x = [t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16] / (t +2)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps I can perform polynomial division here. Let me see if the numerator can be divided by (t +2)^2.\n\nLet me try to factor the numerator:\n\nLet me see if (t +2) is a factor of the numerator. Let me plug t = -2 into the numerator to check. But t is sqrt(n), which is positive, so t can't be -2, but just to check if (t+2) is a factor:\n\nCompute numerator at t = -2: (-2)^4 +2*(-2)^3 +8*(-2) +16 = 16 -16 -16 +16 = 0. Oh! It equals zero. So (t +2) is a factor. Let me perform the division.\n\nDivide numerator by (t+2):\n\nLet me write numerator as t^4 + 2t^3 + 0t^2 +8t +16. Divided by (t+2).\n\nUsing polynomial long division:\n\nDivide t^4 by t \u2192 t^3. Multiply (t+2) by t^3 \u2192 t^4 +2t^3. Subtract from numerator: (t^4 +2t^3 +0t^2 +8t +16) - (t^4 +2t^3) = 0t^4 +0t^3 +0t^2 +8t +16.\n\nNow, the remainder is 0t^3 +0t^2 +8t +16. Wait, but that leaves us with 8t +16. Hmm, but the remaining term is degree 1, but the divisor is degree 1, so we can continue:\n\nDivide 8t by t \u2192 8. Multiply (t+2) by 8 \u21928t +16. Subtract: (8t +16) - (8t +16) =0. So the numerator factors as (t+2)(t^3 +0t^2 +0t +8) \u2192 (t+2)(t^3 +8).\n\nWait, but t^3 +8 can be factored as (t +2)(t^2 -2t +4). Because a^3 + b^3 = (a +b)(a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2). Here, 8 is 2^3, so t^3 +8 = (t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nTherefore, the numerator is (t+2)*(t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4) = (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). \n\nTherefore, the numerator is (t +2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). The denominator is (t+2)^2. So when we divide numerator by denominator, the (t+2)^2 terms cancel out, leaving x = t\u00b2 -2t +4.\n\nOh! That simplifies things a lot. So x simplifies to t\u00b2 - 2t +4, where t is sqrt(n). Since t = sqrt(n), then t\u00b2 is n. Wait, so substituting back:\n\nWait, t is sqrt(n), so t\u00b2 = n, so x = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4 \u2192 x = n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, no, wait, hold on. Wait, I think I messed up here.\n\nWait, let's go back. The numerator was (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). The denominator is (t+2)^2. So when we divide them, we get (t\u00b2 -2t +4). But t is sqrt(n). So substituting back, x = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 -2*sqrt(n) +4? Wait, no, wait: (t\u00b2 - 2t +4). Since t is sqrt(n), then t squared is n. So t squared minus 2t plus 4 would be n - 2*sqrt(n) +4. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, because in the numerator's factorization, after dividing by denominator, we get (t\u00b2 -2t +4). Since t is sqrt(n), so t squared is n. So yes, x = n - 2*sqrt(n) +4.\n\nWait, but that seems like a big simplification. Let me confirm that again. Let me retrace:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWe set t = sqrt(n), so n = t\u00b2. The numerator becomes t^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t +16. The denominator is t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nFactoring numerator: as above, we found that numerator factors into (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). Therefore, dividing by denominator (t+2)^2 gives x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is sqrt(n), substituting back gives:\n\nx = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(n) +4 \u2192 which is n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, that's correct. So x simplifies to x = n - 2\u221an +4. That's a much simpler expression!\n\nSo now, instead of dealing with the original complicated fraction, I can just work with x = n - 2\u221an +4. Now, since n is between 36 and 72, I need to find the possible values of x in that interval.\n\nLet me write x as a function of n: x(n) = n - 2\u221an +4. To find the range of x when n is between 36 and 72, I can analyze this function.\n\nFirst, let's compute x at the endpoints of the interval for n. Since n is between 36 and 72, inclusive, we can compute x when n=36 and n=72. Also, since this is a continuous function, the minimum and maximum will be at the endpoints or at critical points. Let's check if the function has any critical points (i.e., where its derivative is zero) in the interval.\n\nFirst, compute the derivative of x with respect to n:\n\ndx/dn = d/dn [n -2\u221an +4] = 1 - 2*(1/(2\u221an)) +0 = 1 - 1/\u221an.\n\nSet derivative equal to zero to find critical points:\n\n1 - 1/\u221an =0 \u2192 1 = 1/\u221an \u2192 \u221an =1 \u2192 n=1.\n\nBut n is between 36 and72, so the critical point at n=1 is outside the interval. Therefore, the function is either increasing or decreasing throughout the interval. Let's check the sign of the derivative in the interval:\n\nTake n=36, then \u221an=6, so 1/\u221an =1/6 \u22480.1667. Thus, dx/dn =1 -0.1667 \u22480.833>0. Similarly, at n=72, \u221an \u22488.485, so 1/\u221an \u22480.1178, so dx/dn \u22481 -0.1178\u22480.882>0. So the derivative is always positive in the interval. Therefore, x is an increasing function of n on [36,72]. Therefore, the minimum x is at n=36 and maximum at n=72.\n\nTherefore, compute x at n=36 and n=72:\n\nFirst, n=36:\n\nx =36 -2*sqrt(36) +4 = 36 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nWait, that's exactly 28. Hmm, but let me check again:\n\nsqrt(36) is 6, so 2*6 is 12. So 36 -12 is 24, plus 4 is 28. Yep.\n\nNow n=72:\n\nsqrt(72) is sqrt(36*2) =6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. So 2*sqrt(72) \u22482*8.485\u224816.97.\n\nThus x =72 -16.97 +4 \u224872 -16.97 is 55.03, plus 4 is 59.03. So approximately 59.03.\n\nWait, let me compute more precisely:\n\nsqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2). So exactly, 2*sqrt(72)=12*sqrt(2). So exact value would be 72 -12\u221a2 +4. But let's see:\n\nWait, 12\u221a2 is approximately 12*1.4142 \u224816.9704. So 72 -16.9704 =55.0296 +4 is 59.0296. So approximately 59.03.\n\nSo the minimum x is 28 when n=36, and the maximum is approximately 59.03 when n=72. But since the options given have intervals like 28<x<60 (option D), 25<x<64 (C), etc. Wait, let's look at the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)20 < x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm, the minimum is exactly 28, so the lower bound must be less than or equal to 28? Wait, but the options have inequalities as strict. So if the minimum is exactly 28, then 28 <x would not include it. Wait, but the original problem says 36 \u2264 n \u226472. So when n=36, x is exactly 28. The question says \"satisfies\", so if the options are ranges that must include all possible x, then the lower bound must be less than or equal to 28. But the options given for D is 28 <x <60. Since x can be 28, then that interval would not include 28. So the correct interval would need to have lower bound less than or equal to 28. Looking at the options, option D's lower bound is 28 <x, which excludes 28, but since n can be 36 (which gives x=28), the correct interval must include 28. So none of the options except perhaps E?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me confirm the calculation for n=36 again:\n\nx =36 - 2*6 +4 \u2192 36-12=24; 24+4=28. Exactly 28. So the minimum x is 28, and maximum is approximately 59.03. So the possible x ranges from 28 (inclusive) up to approximately 59.03 (exclusive, since n can be up to 72, which is included). Wait, but n is up to 72, so when n=72, x is exactly 72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4. Let me compute sqrt(72) exactly. sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2). So 2*sqrt(72)=12*sqrt(2). Therefore, x at n=72 is 72 +4 -12\u221a2 =76 -12\u221a2. Since sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, so 12*1.4142\u224816.9704. So 76 -16.9704\u224859.0296. So the maximum x is approximately 59.03, which is less than 60. So the maximum x is just under 60, but not reaching 60.\n\nTherefore, the actual range is 28 \u2264 x < ~59.03. So the lower bound is exactly 28, and upper is just under 60. So the interval would be 28 \u2264x <60. But the options given are:\n\nD)28 <x <60: This excludes 28 and includes up to but not including 60. Since x can be exactly 28, which is not included in D's interval, so D is not correct. The next option, C is 25 <x <64. Since 25 is lower than 28, and upper is higher, so 28 is within the lower part, and the upper is higher than 59.03, so that interval would include all possible x. But the problem says \"satisfies\" which of the options. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the question says \"If 36 \u2264n \u226472, then x= ... satisfies\". The options are ranges that x must lie in. Since x can be exactly 28 (when n=36), and the options are all inequalities with strict inequalities. So the correct interval must include 28 and 59.03. Let me check each option:\n\nA)20 <x <54: The upper limit is 54, but x can be up to ~59, so this is too low. So A is wrong.\n\nB)23 <x <58: Upper limit is 58, which is less than ~59, so also too low. So B is wrong.\n\nC)25 <x <64: Lower limit is 25, which is less than 28. Upper limit is 64, which is higher than 59.03. So this interval includes all possible x. So C's range is from 25 to 64, which would include 28 to ~59, so yes, x is within that interval. But wait, the question is which of the options is correct. But let me check D again.\n\nD)28 <x <60: This excludes the lower bound 28, so since x can be exactly 28, then D is not correct. So the only option that includes all possible x is C. But wait, the problem says \"satisfies\" \u2014 does that mean that all x must lie strictly within the given interval? For example, if the actual x can be exactly 28, then the interval must include 28. But the options are written with strict inequalities. Hmm, that's a problem.\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. So 25 is less than 28, so 28 is included. Similarly, the upper is 64, which is above the maximum. So all x from 28 to ~59 are between 25 and 64, so C is correct. But D is 28 <x <60, which excludes the lower end. But the problem states that n can be 36, so x can be exactly 28. Since the inequality is strict, 28 is not included. Therefore, the correct interval must include 28. So C is the only one that includes all possible x.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C says \"25 <x <64\". The lower bound is 25, which is less than 28, so all x are above 25. The upper bound is 64, which is higher than 59.03, so all x are below 64. Therefore, all x satisfy 25 <x <64. Therefore, the correct answer is C. But wait, let me check the maximum again. The maximum x is approximately 59.03, so it's under 60. So even option D's upper limit is 60. So the maximum x is less than 60, so the maximum is under 60, so D's upper limit is okay. So for D, the interval is 28 <x <60. But since the lower bound is 28 (excluded), but x can be 28, which is not in D's interval, so D is invalid. So C is the correct answer?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me confirm the maximum again.\n\nWait, when n=72, x =72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4. Let me compute sqrt(72) precisely:\n\nsqrt(72)= 8.48528137423857. So 2*sqrt(72)=16.97056274847714. \n\nThen 72 -16.97056274847714 = 55.02943725152286. Then adding 4 gives 59.02943725152286. So approximately 59.03. So that's less than 60, so the upper bound is indeed under 60. So the interval would be 28 \u2264x < ~59.03. So the maximum x is less than 60, so the upper limit for D's interval is 60, which is okay. But the lower bound of D is 28, but x can be exactly 28, so 28 is not in D's interval. Therefore, the only option that includes all possible x (including 28) is C, since it starts at 25. \n\nAlternatively, if the question allows the endpoints, but the options have strict inequalities, then perhaps none of them is correct. Wait, but the problem states \"36 \u2264n \u226472\", so n can be 36 and 72. Then x can be exactly 28 and approximately 59.03. The options have strict inequalities. So for example, option C's lower bound is 25 <x, so 28 is okay. The upper bound is <64, which is okay. So all x satisfy 25 <x <64, so C is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check option D again. The upper limit is 60, which is higher than 59.03, so that's okay. The problem is the lower limit. Since x can be exactly 28, but D requires x>28. So 28 is not in D. But in C, x has to be greater than 25, which is true. So C is valid. So the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but hold on. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nSo between these two, C is a larger interval that includes all possible x. But the problem says \"satisfies\", so which is the tightest interval that includes all possible x? The question is probably looking for the minimal interval that covers all possible x. Since the minimal interval would be 28 to ~59.03, so between 28 and 60, but D's lower bound is strict. But since x can be exactly 28, D is not correct. The only option that includes all x is C. So the answer is C?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me double-check the simplification steps again.\n\nOriginal expression: [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me take n=36 and plug into original expression to see if x is indeed 28.\n\nNumerator: 36\u00b2 + 2*sqrt(36)*(36 +4) +16 = 1296 + 2*6*(40) +16 = 1296 + 480 +16 = 1296+496=1792?\n\nWait, 2*6 is 12, 12*40 is 480. 1296 +480 is 1776, plus 16 is 1792.\n\nDenominator: 36 +4*6 +4 =36 +24 +4=64.\n\nSo x =1792 /64 = 28. Correct. So that's right.\n\nAnother test: n=49 (which is 7\u00b2). Let me compute x both ways.\n\nFirst via the simplified formula: x =49 - 2*7 +4 =49-14+4=39.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nNumerator:49\u00b2 +2*sqrt(49)*(49+4) +16 =2401 +2*7*(53)+16 =2401 + 742 +16=2401+758=3159?\n\nWait 2*7 is 14, 14*53 is 742. 2401 +742 =3143 +16=3159.\n\nDenominator:49 +4*7 +4 =49+28+4=81.\n\n3159/81 = 39. Correct. So the simplification is correct.\n\nAnother test: n=16 (but wait n has to be between 36 and 72, but just for testing). Let's see.\n\nWait n=16 would be outside the given range, but let's try.\n\nx simplified would be 16 - 8 +4 =12. Original expression:\n\nNumerator:16\u00b2 +2*4*(20) +16 =256 +160 +16=432.\n\nDenominator:16+8+4=28. 432/28= 15.428..., but simplified gives 12. Wait that's different. Wait, so that inconsistency suggests that my simplification is wrong?\n\nWait, wait a second. Wait n=16, so t=4. Then numerator is t^4 +2t*(t\u00b2+4) +16. Let's compute:\n\nt=4: numerator is 256 +2*4*(16+4) +16 =256 +2*4*20 +16 =256 +160 +16 =432. Denominator is (t+2)^2=6\u00b2=36. 432/36=12. Which matches the simplified x= t\u00b2-2t+4 \u2192 16-8+4=12. So that's correct. So the simplification holds. The problem is when I did denominator for n=16, 16 +4*4 +4=16+16+4=36. So that's correct. So my simplification is correct.\n\nSo returning, the simplification is correct. Therefore, the analysis holds. Thus, the correct interval is between 28 and ~59.03, so the only option that covers this entirely is option C (25 to 64), since 25 is less than 28, and 64 is more than 59.03. Option D's upper limit is 60, which is also acceptable, but its lower limit is 28, which excludes the point at n=36. So between C and D, which is correct?\n\nThe question is asking which interval x satisfies. Since x can be exactly 28 (when n=36), the interval must include 28. Option C's lower bound is 25, so 28 is within. Option D's lower bound is 28, which is not included. So the only option that includes all possible x is C. So the answer must be C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again:\n\nOption C says \"25 <x <64\". Since the maximum x is ~59.03, which is less than 64, and the minimum is 28, which is greater than 25, so yes, all x are in that interval. So C is correct.\n\nAlternatively, if the question had said \"must be contained within which interval\", then C is correct. But perhaps the question is looking for the tightest interval? But the options don't have a tighter one except D, which excludes the lower bound. But since x can be exactly 28, D is not correct. Therefore, the answer must be C. So the correct option is C.\n\nWait but looking at the options again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)20 < x <54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm, so since the actual minimum is 28, which is exactly the lower bound of D but not included, and the upper bound of D is 60 which is more than enough, but since the lower bound is strict, D is invalid. So the only option that works is C. So the answer is C. But wait, let me check the upper limit again. The maximum x is about 59.03, so the upper limit of D is 60, which is higher than that. So the interval in D would include all x except the lower bound. But since x can be exactly 28, which is excluded by D, then D is not correct. Therefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"satisfies\". The question is, does the value of x for all n in [36,72] lie strictly between 25 and 64? Since 25 is less than 28, and 64 is greater than 59.03, yes, so all x are in that interval. So option C is correct. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\n\nThe expression for \\( x \\) simplifies to \\( x = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\). Given \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), substituting the endpoints yields:\n\n- At \\( n = 36 \\): \\( x = 36 - 2 \\times 6 + 4 = 28 \\).\n- At \\( n = 72 \\): \\( x \\approx 72 - 2 \\times 8.485 + 4 \\approx 59.03 \\).\n\nSince \\( x \\) is an increasing function in this interval, the range of \\( x \\) is \\( 28 \\leq x \\leq 59.03 \\).
