      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the greatest number of identical bouquets using all 28 white and 98 red tulips. Hmm, the key here is that each bouquet has to have the same number of white and red tulips, right? And we can't leave any flowers out. So basically, I have to divide both the white and red tulips into groups where each group has the same count, and find the maximum number of such groups.\n\nWait, this sounds like a greatest common divisor (GCD) problem. Because the GCD of the two numbers (28 and 98) would tell me the largest number that can divide both, which would be the maximum number of bouquets. Let me think again. Because each bouquet must have the same number of each color. So if I have, say, n bouquets, then each bouquet would have 28/n white tulips and 98/n red tulips. Both those numbers have to be whole numbers. So n has to be a divisor of both 28 and 98. The greatest such number is the GCD of 28 and 98.\n\nRight, so I need to compute GCD(28, 98). Let's do that. Breaking down into prime factors might help. \n\n28 factors into 2*2*7. 98 factors into 2*49, which is 2*7*7. So the common prime factors are 2 and 7. The minimum exponents for each prime: for 2, the minimum exponent between 2^2 and 2^1 is 1. For 7, the minimum between 7^1 and 7^2 is 1. So GCD is 2^1 *7^1 =14. So the GCD is 14. \n\nWait, so that would mean the maximum number is 14? Let me check. If I make 14 bouquets, each would have 28/14 = 2 white tulips and 98/14 =7 red tulips. That works because 2 and 7 are integers, and all flowers are used. \n\nBut let me check the options. The options include D)14. So that's probably the answer. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in GCD calculation. \n\nAlternative way to compute GCD: \n\nUsing the Euclidean algorithm. \n\nGCD(98,28). \n\nDivide 98 by 28: 28*3=84, remainder 14. \n\nThen GCD(28,14). 28 divided by 14 is 2 with remainder 0. So GCD is 14. Yep, same result. \n\nSo the answer should be D)14. Let me check the options again. The options are A)4, B)7, C)10, D)14, E)21. 14 is there as D. So that's correct. \n\nWait, could there be a mistake in thinking? For instance, maybe the question requires that each bouquet must have at least one of each color? The problem statement says \"identical bouquets\" and that they are identical if the numbers are equal. But there's no requirement stated that each bouquet must have at least one of each. But in this case, with 14 bouquets, each has 2 white and 7 red, so that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought maybe the answer is 7, but 7 is a divisor too. Let's see, 28 divided by 7 is 4, 98 divided by7 is 14. So 7 bouquets would have 4 white and 14 red each. But since 14 is higher than 7, why not go for higher? Since 14 is higher and possible, that's better. \n\nSo yeah, D is the correct answer.\n",

So the primes here are 2 and 7. The minimum exponent for 2 is 1 (since 28 has 2\u00b2 and 98 has 2\u00b9), and for 7 it's 1 (since 28 has 7\u00b9 and 98 has 7\u00b2).

If we use 7 bouquets, then each would have 28/7=4 white and 98/7=14 red. That works, but 14 is higher. Similarly, 14 is possible. 21 is higher than 14, but 21 is larger than both 28 and 98?
