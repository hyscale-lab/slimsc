      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out what replaces the question mark in the equation a\u00b2 minus b\u00b2 divided by (a + b) squared times something equals (a - b) squared. Hmm, the equation is written as (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 multiplied by the question mark equals (a - b)\u00b2. Wait, maybe I should parse the original equation again carefully.\n\nThe question says: (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 (?) = (a - b)\u00b2. Oh right, the question mark is multiplied by that fraction. So the equation is [(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2] multiplied by the unknown equals (a - b)\u00b2. I need to solve for the question mark.\n\nFirst, let me recall some algebraic identities. The numerator a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is a difference of squares, which factors into (a + b)(a - b). So replacing that in the equation: [( (a + b)(a - b) ) / (a + b)\u00b2 ] multiplied by the question mark equals (a - b)\u00b2.\n\nSimplifying the fraction here: the numerator has (a + b) and the denominator has (a + b) squared. So (a + b)/(a + b)\u00b2 cancels down to 1/(a + b). The remaining part is (a - b) in the numerator. So the fraction becomes [(a - b)/(a + b)] multiplied by the question mark equals (a - b) squared.\n\nSo let me write that as an equation: [ (a - b)/(a + b) ) ] * X = (a - b)^2, where X is the question mark. To solve for X, I can rearrange the equation. Multiply both sides by (a + b)/(a - b) to isolate X. \n\nSo X = (a - b)^2 * [ (a + b)/(a - b) ) ] \n\nSimplifying that, the (a - b) in the denominator cancels with one from the squared term. So that leaves (a - b) multiplied by (a + b). Which is (a - b)(a + b). But wait, that's the same as a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 again. Wait, but looking at the options, option A is (a + b)(a - b). So that would be the same as what I just got. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nOriginal equation:\n\n[ (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) / (a + b)^2 ] * X = (a - b)^2 \n\nWe factored a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 as (a + b)(a - b), so substituting:\n\n[ (a + b)(a - b) / (a + b)^2 ) ] * X = (a - b)^2 \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: (a + b) cancels with one from the denominator's (a + b)^2, leaving (a - b)/(a + b). So the equation becomes:\n\n[ (a - b)/(a + b) ) ] * X = (a - b)^2 \n\nTo solve for X, multiply both sides by (a + b)/(a - b):\n\nX = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)/(a - b) \n\nThe (a - b) in the denominator cancels with one from the numerator's squared term, leaving (a - b)*(a + b). \n\nTherefore, X is (a + b)(a - b), which is option A. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA)(a + b)(a - b)\nB)(a - b)^2\nC)(a + b)^2\nD)a^3 + b^3\nE)None of these.\n\nSo the correct answer should be A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra steps. Let me do a quick check with numbers. Let's pick a=3 and b=1.\n\nOriginal equation: (3\u00b2 -1\u00b2)/(3+1)^2 * X = (3-1)^2.\n\nCalculating left side before multiplying by X:\n\n(9-1)/16 = 8/16 = 0.5. So 0.5 * X = (2)^2 =4.\n\nThus X must be 4 /0.5 =8.\n\nNow, what's (a + b)(a - b) when a=3 and b=1? (4)(2)=8. That matches. So yes, option A works here. Another test with a=2 and b=1:\n\nLeft side fraction: (4-1)/(3)^2 = 3/9 =1/3. Then 1/3 * X should equal (1)^2 =1. So X=3. \n\nOption A gives (3)(1)=3, which is correct. So that seems to check out. Therefore the answer is A. But wait, the options list option A as (a + b)(a - b), which is exactly what we got. So the correct answer is A. Therefore, the answer should be option A.\n",
