      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So the question is about Raj and Rahim's ages. Hmm, the problem says that five years ago, Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. And right now, Raj is 17. We need to find out Rahim's current age. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let's note down the current ages. Raj is 17 now. Five years back, Raj's age would have been 17 minus 5, which is 12 years old. Wait, right, so five years ago Raj was 12. At that time, he was one-third of Rahim's age then. So, if I let Rahim's age five years ago be some number, then Raj's age (which was 12) is a third of that. \n\nLet me write variables for clarity. Let me denote Rahim's current age as R. Then, five years ago, Rahim's age would have been R minus 5. Because five years have passed since then. \n\nThe problem states that Raj's age five years ago was one-third of Rahim's age at that time. So, Raj's age then (which is 12) equals (1/3) times Rahim's age then. So the equation would be: \n\n12 = (1/3) * (R - 5)\n\nHmm, right. So solving for R here. Let's do that. Multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction. \n\n12 * 3 = R - 5 \u2192 36 = R -5. Then adding 5 to both sides gives R = 41. Wait, so Rahim's current age is 41? Let me check the options. Option B is 41, so that's the answer? \n\nWait a second, let me double-check. Let me plug the numbers back in. If Rahim is 41 now, five years ago he was 36. Raj was 12 then. And 12 is indeed a third of 36. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me see. The problem says \"Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back.\" So yes, that translates to Raj's age then = (1/3)* Rahim's age then. \n\nAnother way to think: current ages are Raj:17, Rahim: R. Five years ago, Raj was 12, Rahim was R-5. The equation is correct. So solving gives R=41. So the answer should be B)41. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)37, B)41, C)40, D)42, E)43. So B is there. So I think that's the right answer. Let me think again if I messed up any step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I confused the ratio. Like, maybe I thought Rahim was one-third of Raj, but no. The wording is \"Raj was one-third as old as Rahim\", so Raj = 1/3 * Rahim's age. So yes, that part is correct. \n\nSo yes, the answer must be B)41. I think that's correct.\n",
