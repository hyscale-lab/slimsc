      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about finding the minimum selling price per component so that the company's yearly profit is at least $626,400. Hmm. Alright, first I need to understand all the given information.\n\nSo the company makes 420 units each month. The production cost per component is $110. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The question is asking for the minimum selling price per component to ensure the yearly profit meets that target. \n\nProfit is calculated as revenue minus costs. Right, so I need to compute both the total revenue and total costs over the year, then set up an equation where profit is at least $626,400. \n\nLet me break it down step by step. Let's denote the selling price per component as 'S'. \n\nFirst, the number of units produced and sold per year. Since they make 420 each month, over 12 months, that's 420 * 12. Let me calculate that. 420 times 12... 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so total is 5040 units per year. \n\nTotal revenue for the year would then be the number of units sold multiplied by the selling price. So that's 5040 * S.\n\nNow, the total production cost per year. Each component costs $110 to make, so total cost is 5040 * 110. Let me compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 *10 is 50,400. So adding those gives 554,400. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 110 is 100+10, so 5040*(100 +10) = 5040*100 +5040*10 = 504,000 +50,400 = 554,400. So total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nProfit is Revenue - Cost. We need this profit to be at least $626,400. So:\n\nRevenue - Cost \u2265 626,400\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\n5040S - 554,400 \u2265 626,400\n\nNow I need to solve for S. Let's rearrange the inequality.\n\n5040S \u2265 626,400 + 554,400\n\nAdding those two numbers: 626,400 + 554,400. Let me compute that. 600k +500k is 1,100,000. Then 26,400 +54,400 is 80,800. So total is 1,180,800. \n\nSo 5040S \u2265 1,180,800\n\nDivide both sides by 5040 to solve for S. \n\nLet me do that division. 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Hmm. Maybe simplify the numbers first. Let's see if both numbers can be divided by 10, so 118,080 divided by 504. \n\nAlternatively, maybe divide numerator and denominator by some common factors. Let me see. Let's try dividing numerator and denominator by 10 first, so 1,180,800 / 10 = 118,080 and 5040/10 is 504. \n\nHmm, 504 is 504. Let's see if 504 divides into 118,080. Let's divide 118,080 \u00f7 504.\n\nAlternatively, maybe break down 504 into 504 = 504. Let me see how many times 504 fits into 118,080. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps divide numerator and denominator by 504 to see. Wait, perhaps breaking into prime factors might help. Alternatively, let me try 504 \u00d7 200 = 100,800. \n\nSo subtract that from 118,080: 118,080 - 100,800 = 17,280. \n\nNow, 504 \u00d7 34 is 504*30=15,120 and 504*4=2,016, so total 17,136. Hmm, that's close. Wait 34\u00d7504= 504*(30+4) = 15120 + 2016 = 17,136. \n\nSo 17,280 minus 17,136 is 144. \n\nSo total would be 200 +34 = 234, and then 144 left. \n\nHmm, 144 divided by 504 is 144/504 = 0.2857... So approximately 234.2857. But since the question asks for the minimum selling price that will guarantee the profit is at least the target, we can't round down. Because if we take 234.2857, then 234 would be insufficient. \n\nWait, but maybe my calculation is wrong here. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let me try 5040 \u00d7 S = 1,180,800. \n\nWait 5040 \u00d7 S = 1,180,800. \n\nLet me divide both sides by 5040. Let me see:\n\n5040 \u00d7 S = 1,180,800\n\nSo S = 1,180,800 / 5040\n\nLet me compute that division. Let me see:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504.\n\nHmm, let's divide numerator and denominator by 24. 504 \u00f724 is 21. 118,080 \u00f724 is 4920. \n\nSo now 4920 / 21. Let me compute that. 21 \u00d7 234 = 21*(200 +34) = 4200 + 714 = 4914. \n\nSo 4920 -4914 =6. So 4920/21 =234 +6/21 =234.2857... So approximately 234.2857. \n\nSince the question asks for the minimum selling price that will guarantee the profit is at least $626,400, the price must be at least this value. Since the options are whole numbers, the minimum would be the next whole number, which is 235? Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are 226, 230, 240, 260, 280. \n\nHmm, none of those are 235. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the total required. Let me go through the steps again to confirm. \n\nFirst, total units per year: 420 per month *12 =5040. That's correct.\n\nTotal cost per year: 5040 *110. Let me recalculate that. 5040 *100 is 504,000. 5040 *10 is 50,400. Adding them gives 554,400. Correct.\n\nProfit needed is at least 626,400. So total revenue must be Profit + Cost. So 626,400 +554,400 = 1,180,800. That's correct.\n\nSo total revenue must be at least 1,180,800. Revenue is 5040 * S \u22651,180,800 \u2192 S \u2265 1,180,800 /5040. \n\nCalculating that division again:\n\nLet me see 5040 \u00d7 234 = ?\n\nLet me compute 5040 \u00d7 200 = 1,008,000.\n\n5040 \u00d734 = ?\n\n5040 \u00d730 =151,200; 5040 \u00d74 =20,160 \u2192 total 151,200 +20,160=171,360.\n\nSo 200+34=234 \u2192 total 1,008,000 +171,360 = 1,179,360.\n\nHmm, that's 1,179,360. The required is 1,180,800. \n\nSo the difference is 1,180,800 -1,179,360 = 1,440. \n\nSo 5040 \u00d7 S needs to be 1,440 more. Since each additional dollar per component adds 5040 dollars to the revenue. So 1440 /5040 = 0.2857. So total S is 234 +0.2857 \u2248234.2857. \n\nSo S must be at least approximately $234.29. Since the price per component has to be a whole number (assuming the options are in whole dollars), then the minimum price would be $235. But looking at the options given, the closest higher option is 230? Wait no, 230 is lower than 234.29. Wait the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. \n\nHmm, so 234.28 is between 230 and 240. Since the question asks for the minimum price that will guarantee the profit is at least 626,400, then 230 would be insufficient because 230 is below the required 234.29. The next possible option is 240. \n\nWait, so the correct answer must be C)240. Because 230 is too low. Let me check with 240. \n\nIf S is 240, then revenue is 5040 *240. Let me compute that. \n\n5040 *200 = 1,008,000. 5040 *40=201,600. So total is 1,008,000 +201,600 =1,209,600. \n\nSubtract the cost of 554,400 \u2192 profit is 1,209,600 -554,400 = 655,200. Which is more than the required 626,400. \n\nIf I try 230, then revenue is 5040*230. Let's compute that. \n\n5040*200 = 1,008,000. 5040*30 = 151,200. Total is 1,008,000 +151,200 =1,159,200. \n\nProfit would be 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So 230 is insufficient. \n\nTherefore the minimum is 240, which is option C. \n\nWait, but why isn't there an option between 230 and 240? The calculation shows that the exact required is about 234.29, so the minimum whole dollar price would be 235, but since that's not an option, the next available is 240. So C is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, the question says \"yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400\". So yes, that's exactly what I considered. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the total units. Wait, 420 per month, 12 months: 420\u00d712 is 5040? Let me confirm 420\u00d712. 400\u00d712=4800, 20\u00d712=240 \u2192 total 5040. Yes. \n\nHmm, so yes, the answer is C)240.\n",

So adding those gives 554,400. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 110 is 100+10, so 5040*(100 +10) = 5040*100 +5040*10 = 504,000 +50,400 = 554,400. So total cost is $554,400 per year.\n\nProfit is Revenue - Cost.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the minimum selling price per component so that the yearly profit is at least $626,400. Hmm, profit is revenue minus costs. Right, so first I should probably calculate the total revenue needed and then work out the per-unit price.\n\nThe company makes 420 units each month. So over a year, that's 420 times 12. Let me compute that. 420 * 12. Let's do 400*12 = 4800, plus 20*12=240, so total 5040 units a year. Got that.\n\nThe production cost per component is $110. So the total production cost for the year would be 5040 * 110. Hmm, let me calculate that. 5000*110 is 550,000, and 40*110 is 4,400. So total cost is 550k +4,400 = $554,400 per year. \n\nThe desired profit is at least $626,400. So profit = revenue - cost. We want revenue - cost >= 626,400. Therefore, revenue needs to be at least 626,400 + cost. \n\nAdding those two numbers: 626,400 + 554,400. Let's see, 626,400 + 500,000 is 1,126,400. Then add 54,400: 1,126,400 +54,400 = 1,180,800. So the total revenue must be at least $1,180,800 for the year.\n\nSince revenue is price per unit times number of units sold, which is 5040 units. Let me denote the selling price per component as P. Then, 5040 * P >= 1,180,800. To find the minimum P, we can divide both sides by 5040.\n\nCalculating 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Hmm, maybe simplify this. Let's see if both numbers can be divided by 10 first to make it 118,080 / 504. Maybe divide numerator and denominator by 24? Let's see: 504 divided by 24 is 21, and 118,080 divided by 24 is... 118,080 \u00f7 24: 24*4920 = 118,080. So that gives 4920 / 21. Wait, maybe another way. Alternatively, 5040 times P equals 1,180,800. Let me compute 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nAlternatively, breaking down the numbers:\n\n5040 = 720 *7 (since 720*7=5040?), wait 720*7 is 5040? Let me check: 700*7=4900, 20*7=140, so yes, 4900+140=5040. So 5040 = 720 *7.\n\nSo 1,180,800 divided by 5040 is the same as (1,180,800 \u00f7 720) \u00f77. Let's do 1,180,800 \u00f7720 first. 720 x 1640 = ?\n\nWait maybe easier to divide numerator and denominator by 10 first: 118,080 / 504. Let me see:\n\n504 \u00d7 234 = ?\n\nWait perhaps trial and error. Let me see 504 \u00d7 200 = 100,800. 504 \u00d7 230 = 504*(200+30) = 100,800 + 15,120 = 115,920. Then 504 \u00d74 is 2016. So adding 230 +4 =234 gives 115,920 +2,016=117,936. But 118,080 -117,936 is 144. 144 is 504*(144/504) = 144/504 = 0.2857... Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, 118,080 divided by 504:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 24: 118,080 \u00f724 = 4920, 504 \u00f724=21. So 4920/21. Let's divide 4920 by 21. 21 \u00d7234 = 21*(200+34)=4200 + 714 = 4914. So 21\u00d7234=4914. Then 4920-4914=6. So 4920/21 =234 +6/21 = 234.2857... So approximately 234.2857. So that's 234 and 2/7. Hmm, but since the original equation is 5040 * P >= 1,180,800, then P must be at least 234.2857... But the options are whole numbers, so we need to round up to the next whole number since it has to be at least that. So the minimum price would be 235? Wait, but the options don't have 235. Let me check my calculations again.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the division steps. Let me try another approach. Let me do the division 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040.\n\nLet me write it as:\n\n5040 \u00d7 P = 1,180,800 \u2192 P = 1,180,800 /5040.\n\nLet me divide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 /504.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 12: 118,080 \u00f712=9840, 504 \u00f712=42. So now 9840/42.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 9840 \u00f76=1640, 42 \u00f76=7 \u2192 1640/7. \n\n1640 divided by 7: 7\u00d7234=1638. So 1640-1638=2. So 1640/7 =234 + 2/7 \u2248234.2857.\n\nSo P must be at least approximately $234.29. Since the price must be at least this to meet the profit, and the options are whole numbers, so the minimum integer price would be 235. But looking at the options: the choices are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. Wait, there's no 235. Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in calculations?\n\nWait let me recheck all steps again.\n\nTotal units per year: 420 per month \u00d712= 5040. Correct.\n\nTotal cost per year: 5040 \u00d7 $110. Let's calculate that again. 5040 \u00d7 100 is 504,000. 5040 \u00d710 is 50,400. So total 504k +50,400 =554,400. That's correct.\n\nDesired profit is 626,400. So total revenue must be cost + profit: 554,400 +626,400 = 1,180,800. That's correct.\n\nRevenue needed: 1,180,800. Divided by 5040 units gives per unit price. Let me compute 1,180,800 \u00f75040 again. Let me try a different way.\n\nLet me divide both numbers by 5040's factors. 5040 is 7*720, but maybe 5040 divided by 10 is 504, so 1,180,800 divided by 5040 is same as (1,180,800 \u00f710)/(5040 \u00f710) = 118,080/504. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 504's factors. Let's see, 504= 7\u00d772. 118,080 divided by 504.\n\nAlternatively, 504 \u00d7 200 = 100,800. Subtract that from 118,080: 118,080-100,800 =17,280. Now, 504 \u00d734 is 504\u00d730=15,120 and 504\u00d74=2,016 \u2192 total 17,136. So 34 gives 17,136. 17,280 -17,136=144. 504 \u00d70.2857 is about 144. So total is 200+34=234, plus 0.2857. So same as before, 234.2857.\n\nSo the required price is $234.29. Since the question asks for the minimum price that will guarantee the profit is at least the target, the price must be at least that. Since they can't charge fractions of a dollar, the minimum whole dollar amount would be $235. But the options don't have that. The next possible option is C)240. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps?\n\nWait the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. Hmm, so maybe I messed up in the profit formula?\n\nWait let me check again. Profit is revenue minus production cost. So required profit is 626,400. So total revenue must be production cost + desired profit. That's correct. So 554,400 +626,400 = 1,180,800. That's right.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the total units. Let me confirm. 420 units per month times 12 months: 420\u00d712. 400\u00d712=4800, 20\u00d712=240, so 4800+240=5040. That's correct.\n\nHmm. Wait, maybe the question says \"yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400\". So the calculation is correct. So the required price per unit is 234.2857. Since the options are given as integers, the minimum price must be 235, but since that's not an option, maybe I made a mistake. Wait the options include 230 (B) and 240 (C). Let me check if 230 is sufficient. Let's see:\n\nIf the price is $230, then total revenue is 5040 \u00d7230. Let me compute that.\n\n5040 \u00d7200 = 1,008,000. 5040 \u00d730 = 151,200. So total is 1,008,000 +151,200 =1,159,200. \n\nThen subtract production cost (554,400) \u2192 profit would be 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800. But the required profit is 626,400. So that's less than needed. \n\nAt 230, profit is 604,800, which is 21,600 short. \n\nThen 240: let's check. 5040 \u00d7240. 5040 \u00d7200 =1,008,000. 5040 \u00d740 =201,600. Total 1,008,000 +201,600 =1,209,600. Subtract 554,400 gives profit of 1,209,600-554,400 =655,200. That's more than 626,400. \n\nSo 240 would give enough. \n\nWhat about 234.29 would be needed. Since the options don't have 234.29, so the minimum price in the options that would satisfy the condition is 240. Because 230 is too low, so the next possible is 240. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is C)240.\n",

So total is 1,008,000 +151,200 =1,159,200. \n\nThen subtract production cost (554,400) \u2192 profit would be 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800. But the required profit is 626,400. So that's less than needed. \n\nAt 230, profit is 604,800, which is 21,600 short. \n\nThen 240: let's check. 5040 \u00d7240. 5040 \u00d7200 =1,008,000. 5040 \u00d740 =201,600. Total 1,008,000 +201,600 =1,209,600. Subtract 554,400 gives profit of 1,209,600-554,400 =655,200. That's more than 626,400. \n\nSo 240 would give enough. \n\nWhat about 234.29 would be needed. Since the options don't have 234.29, so the minimum price in the options that would satisfy the condition is 240. Because 230 is too low, so the next possible is 240. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is C)240.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum selling price per component required for the company to achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we start by calculating the total annual production cost and the required total revenue. \n\n1. **Annual Production Volume**:  \n   The company produces 420 units/month, so annually:  \n   \\( 420 \\times 12 = 5040 \\text{ units} \\).\n\n2. **Total Annual Production Cost**:  \n   The cost per unit is $110, so:  \n   \\( 5040 \\times 110 = 554,400 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\n3. **Required Total Revenue**:  \n   The desired profit is $626,400. Thus, the total revenue must be:  \n   \\( 554,400 + 626,400 = 1,180,800 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\n4. **Minimum Selling Price per Unit**:  \n   To find the price \\( P \\) such that revenue meets or exceeds $1,180,800:  \n   \\( 5040 \\times P \\geq 1,180,800 \\).  \n   Solving for \\( P \\):  \n   \\( P \\geq \\frac{1,180,800}{5040} = 234.2857 \\text{ dollars} \\).\n\nSince the price must be a whole number and the calculated minimum is approximately $234.29, the smallest integer price that satisfies the requirement is $235. However, this value is not among the options. Checking the provided choices:  \n- **Option B ($230)**:  \n  Revenue = \\( 5040 \\times 230 = 1,159,200 \\).  \n  Profit = \\( 1,159,200 - 554,400 = 604,800 \\), which is insufficient.  \n- **Option C ($240)**:  \n  Revenue = \\( 5040 \\times 240 = 1,209,600 \\).  \n  Profit = \\( 1,209,600 - 554,400 = 655,200 \\), which meets the requirement.  \n\nThus, the minimum price from the options provided is **$240**.\n\nAnswer: C",
