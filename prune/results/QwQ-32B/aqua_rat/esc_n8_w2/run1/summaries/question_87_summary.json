      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the minimum number of students in a school where there are more than 501 students. 20% took physics exactly, and 28% took math exactly. Hmm, so I need to find the smallest number over 501 where both 20% and 28% of that number are whole numbers because you can't have a fraction of a student. \n\nWait, right. The percentages have to result in integers because the number of students can't be a decimal. So the total number of students must be such that when multiplied by 0.2 and 0.28, both results are integers. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, 20% is the same as 1/5, so the total number of students must be divisible by 5. Because 20% of N is N/5, which must be an integer. Similarly, 28% is 28/100, which simplifies to 7/25. So for 28% of N to be an integer, N must be a multiple of 25 divided by the GCD of 28 and 100? Wait, maybe better to think of it as 28% = 0.28, so 0.28*N must be integer. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, 28% of N must be an integer. Let me write that as N * 28 / 100 = (N * 7)/25. So that fraction must be an integer. So 25 must divide N*7. Since 7 and 25 are coprime (no common factors except 1), N must be a multiple of 25. Wait, no. Wait, 7 and 25 have GCD 1, so 25 divides N. Because 7 and 25 are coprime, so 25 divides N. Because 25 divides 7N, so 25 divides N. So N must be a multiple of 25.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If (7N)/25 must be an integer, then 7N must be divisible by 25. Since 7 and 25 are coprime, 25 must divide N. Therefore N must be a multiple of 25.\n\nSimilarly, for the 20% part, which is (20/100)*N = N/5. So N must be divisible by 5. So the total N must be a multiple of both 5 and 25. Well, 25 is already a multiple of 5, so the LCM of 5 and 25 is 25. Therefore N must be a multiple of 25. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, the problem states that exactly 20% took physics and exactly 28% took math. So those are separate groups? Or could there be overlap? Wait, the wording says \"exactly took physics\" and \"exactly took math\". So perhaps that means that the 20% are only those who took physics and not math, and 28% are only those who took math and not physics. Wait, but the problem says \"exactly took physics\" and \"exactly took math\". Hmm, maybe \"exactly\" here means that exactly 20% are in physics, and exactly 28% are in math, but there could be some overlap. Wait, but the problem might be interpreted as the number of students taking only physics is 20%, and the number taking only math is 28%, so they are mutually exclusive? Or is it possible that the total in physics is 20% and the total in math is 28%, but some might have taken both?\n\nThe wording is a bit ambiguous here. Let me read again: \"20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math.\" The word \"exactly\" might mean that exactly 20% took physics (so those who took physics are exactly 20%, and similarly for math). But perhaps \"exactly\" is meant to say that the only students who took physics are those 20%, so no overlap? Like, maybe they are separate groups. Because if there was overlap, then the total percentage taking either could be more than 48%, but the problem doesn't mention anything else. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"exactly took physics\" means that the students who took physics only took physics (i.e., didn't take math), and similarly for math. So the 20% and 28% are separate. In that case, the total number of students would be the sum of those in physics only, math only, plus those in neither, and possibly both. But the problem states that exactly 20% took physics and exactly 28% took math. Wait, maybe it's that exactly 20% are in physics (regardless of math), and exactly 28% are in math (regardless of physics). But then the problem would be about the total number where both those percentages are integers. Because even if there's overlap, the counts for each must be integers. So perhaps the exact wording is that 20% took physics (could also have taken math), and 28% took math (could also have taken physics). But the problem says \"exactly took physics\"\u2014maybe that wording implies that those percentages are the exact count, so the numbers must be integers. So regardless of overlap, the counts for each must be integers.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest N>501 such that N is divisible by 5 (since 20% is 1/5, so N must be divisible by 5) and also N must be such that 28% of N is an integer. Let me recast the second condition again: 28% of N is (28/100)*N = (7/25)*N. So 7N must be divisible by 25, which, as before, requires that N must be a multiple of 25, since 7 and 25 are coprime. Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nIf 7N/25 is integer, then 25 divides 7N. Since GCD(7,25)=1, then 25 divides N. So N must be divisible by 25.\n\nTherefore, N must be a multiple of both 5 and 25. Since 25 is a multiple of 5, the LCM of 5 and 25 is 25. So N must be a multiple of 25.\n\nTherefore, the smallest N greater than 501 that is a multiple of 25. Let me calculate:\n\nWhat's the smallest multiple of 25 greater than 501? Let's see: 500 is 20*25, so 500 is 25*20. The next one would be 525, then 550, 575, 600, etc. Wait, but the options given are A)550, B)570, C)600, D)700, E)none. So 550 is a multiple of 25 (since 550 divided by 25 is 22). But wait, 550 divided by 5 is 110, so that's okay. So 550 is a possible candidate. But the problem says \"more than 501 students\"\u2014so 501 is the minimum, so the next possible is 502, but we need N to be a multiple of 25. So the first N over 501 that is a multiple of 25 would be 525 (since 500 is exactly 500, so next is 525). But 525 is not in the options. The options start at 550. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, 25*21 is 525, which is 21*25. 25*22 is 550, which is option A. So the minimal N would be 525, but since that's not an option, the next is 550. So the answer would be A)550? But let me check again.\n\nWait, but perhaps there is another condition here. Because if the problem states that exactly 20% took physics and exactly 28% took math, maybe the total number of students taking either subject can't exceed 100%, so the sum of the two percentages must be less than or equal to 100%, but that's not necessarily required unless they are mutually exclusive. Wait, no. The problem might not require that. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two percentages (20% and 28%) must not overlap. For instance, if the problem says \"exactly took physics\" and \"exactly took math\", maybe implying that those are the only two groups, but that would mean that 20% +28% =48% is the total taking either, but then the rest could be neither. However, that might not affect the calculation of N's minimum value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an overlap between the two groups, but the counts for each must still be integers. So regardless of overlap, the counts must be integers. Therefore, the only constraints are that N must be divisible by 5 (for 20%) and must be divisible by 25 (for 28%). Wait, but 28% requires N divisible by 25? Let me confirm.\n\nLet me re-calculate the 28% condition again. 28% of N must be integer. So 28*N/100 must be integer. Simplify 28/100 to 7/25. So 7N must be divisible by 25. Since 7 and 25 are coprime (their GCD is 1), then 25 must divide N. Therefore, N must be a multiple of 25. So yes, N must be divisible by 25.\n\nTherefore, the number of students must be a multiple of 25. So the minimal N over 501 is 525, but since that's not an option, the next is 550. 550 is option A. But let's check the options given. The options are A)550, B)570, C)600, D)700, E)none. So 550 is an option, so that would be the answer? But wait, wait a second. Wait 550 divided by 25 is 22, so that works. But maybe there's another condition I missed?\n\nWait, let me check the 20% part again. 20% of N must be an integer. 20% is 1/5. So N must be divisible by 5, which 550 is (550/5=110). So that's okay. So 550 satisfies both conditions. But 525 is smaller than 550. But 525 is not listed in the options. The options start at 550. So perhaps the minimal N is 550, so the answer would be A)550. But why would the problem have an option E?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see again. Wait, maybe the problem requires that both percentages can be integers, but also, when you add them, they can't exceed 100%? Let me see: 20% +28% =48%, which is way under 100%, so that's okay. So that's not a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number of students taking both subjects must be an integer as well? Wait, but the problem doesn't state that. The problem just says exactly 20% took physics and exactly 28% took math. So those could be overlapping groups. For example, some students might have taken both, but the counts for each are still integers. So the overlap doesn't affect the requirement that 0.2N and 0.28N are integers.\n\nTherefore, the minimal N is indeed the least multiple of 25 greater than 501. The first such is 525, but since that's not an option, the next is 550. So the answer would be A)550. But wait, the options include 550, which is an option. So the correct answer should be A? But let me check the options again. The options are A)550, B)570, C)600, D)700, E)none of these. But perhaps there's a mistake here. Wait, maybe I miscalculated the minimal N. Let me see.\n\nWait, 501 is the minimum number of students. So N has to be more than 501, so N must be at least 502. The next multiple of 25 after 500 is 525 (since 25*21=525). 525 is indeed greater than 501, so that's the minimal possible. But since 525 is not among the options, the next option is 550, but the problem says \"could be the least possible\", so maybe the answer is E) none of these, because the correct answer is 525, which isn't listed. \n\nWait, the options are A to D, so if the correct answer is 525, which is not listed, then the answer is E. But maybe I made an error in my calculation?\n\nWait, let's re-express the conditions again. \n\nThe problem says 20% exactly took physics, so that number must be an integer. 28% exactly took math, that number must be an integer. The total students N must be such that N>501.\n\nSo N must be divisible by 5 (because 20% is 1/5) and must be divisible by 25 (because 28% requires N divisible by 25). Wait, but 25 is already a multiple of 5. So the LCM of 5 and 25 is 25, so the minimal N is the smallest multiple of 25 above 501. \n\nSo 500 is 25\u00d720, so next is 25\u00d721=525. So 525 is the minimal. Since none of the options have 525, the answer would be E) none of these. \n\nAh! So the options given do not include 525. The options are 550, 570, 600, 700. So the correct minimal N is 525, which is not an option. Therefore, the answer must be E) none of these. \n\nWait, that makes sense. I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought the next option after 525 is 550. But since 525 is the correct answer, but it's not listed, the correct choice is E.\n",

The next multiples of 25 (550, 575, 600, etc.) are larger, but none of these are the minimal possible value. Since 525 is not an option, the correct answer is **E) none of these**.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem says there are more than 501 students in a school. Exactly 20% took physics and exactly 28% took math. We need to find the least possible number of students, and the options are given. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the key here is that the percentages given (20% and 28%) must result in whole numbers of students because you can't have a fraction of a student. So the total number of students must be a number that when multiplied by 20% and 28% gives integers. \n\nLet me denote the total number of students as N. Since 20% of N must be an integer, N has to be divisible by 5 because 20% is 1/5. Similarly, 28% of N must also be an integer. Let me check what 28% is as a fraction. 28% is 28/100, which simplifies to 7/25. So 7/25 of N must be an integer. That means N must be a multiple of 25 divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 7 and 25? Wait, maybe I should think differently. \n\nAlternatively, for 28% of N to be an integer, N must be such that 28*N/100 is an integer. So 28N must be divisible by 100. Let me write that as 28N divisible by 100. Let's factor 28 and 100. 28 is 4*7, and 100 is 4*25. So 28N divisible by 100 implies that (4*7)*N must be divisible by 4*25. The 4 cancels out, so 7*N must be divisible by 25. Therefore, 7N must be divisible by 25. Since 7 and 25 are coprime (they share no common factors except 1), N must be divisible by 25. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. \n\nYes, because if 7N is divisible by 25, then since 7 and 25 are coprime, N must be divisible by 25. So N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nBut also, from the 20% condition, N must be divisible by 5. But since 25 is already a multiple of 5, the 20% condition is automatically satisfied if N is a multiple of 25. Wait, no, actually, 20% requires that N is divisible by 5. But 25 is a multiple of 5, so that's okay. But maybe there's another condition here. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this by considering both conditions together. The total number of students N must be such that:\n\n20% of N is an integer \u2192 N must be divisible by 5 (since 0.2*N = N/5 must be integer).\n\n28% of N must be an integer \u2192 0.28*N = (28/100)*N = (7/25)*N must be integer. So 7N must be divisible by 25. Since 7 and 25 are coprime, N must be divisible by 25. \n\nSo combining both conditions, N must be divisible by both 5 and 25. But since 25 is a multiple of 5, the stricter condition is that N must be divisible by 25. Wait, but maybe there's an overlap here. Let me confirm:\n\nWait, the first condition requires N divisible by 5. The second requires N divisible by 25. So the LCM (least common multiple) of 5 and 25 is 25. Therefore, N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nSo the smallest possible N that is over 501 and is a multiple of 25. Let's see the options given. The options are 550, 570, 600, 700, or none. \n\nWait, 550 divided by 25 is 22, so that's a multiple of 25. 570 divided by 25 is 22.8, so not an integer. So 570 isn't a multiple of 25. 600 divided by 25 is 24, so yes. 700 divided by 25 is 28. \n\nBut the question says \"more than 501\". The smallest N that is a multiple of 25 over 501. Let's see, 500 is exactly 500, which is under 501. The next multiple is 525? Wait 500+25=525. But 525 is 525 students. But is 525 one of the options? The options start at 550. Wait, but the options given are A)550, B)570, C)600, D)700, E) none. \n\nHmm, so the minimal N according to this logic would be 525. But since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake here. Wait, but the problem says \"exactly 20% took physics and exactly 28% took math\". Wait, maybe there's an overlap? Wait, the question says \"exactly took physics\" and \"exactly took math\". Does that mean that these are the only students who took those subjects, or that exactly those percentages took them, possibly with some overlap? Wait, the wording is \"exactly took\", so maybe that means that exactly 20% took physics and exactly 28% took math, but there could be students who took both? Wait, but the way the question is phrased, \"exactly took physics\" might mean that those are the only ones in physics, and same for math. Or perhaps it's saying that exactly those percentages are the ones who took the subjects, meaning that the numbers must be integers. \n\nWait, perhaps the confusion is whether the percentages are exclusive. Like, maybe 20% took only physics, 28% took only math, and some could have taken both. But in that case, the total number would be more than 20%+28%, but the problem states that exactly 20% took physics (so maybe including those who took both?), but the wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the problem says \"exactly took physics\" and \"exactly took math\". Hmm, maybe that phrasing implies that those are the exact percentages who took each subject, but they could overlap. \n\nWait, but regardless of that, the key point is that the number of students taking physics must be an integer, and the same for math. So even if some students took both, the counts must be integers. So the total number of students must satisfy both 0.2*N and 0.28*N are integers. \n\nSo my earlier reasoning holds. So N must be a multiple of 25. The next question is, what is the smallest N greater than 501 that is a multiple of 25. Let's compute:\n\n501 divided by 25 is 20.04. So the next integer multiple is 21*25 = 525. But 525 is not among the options given. The first option given is 550, which is 22*25. So the minimal N here would be 525, which isn't listed. Therefore, the answer must be E) none of these. But wait, let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the LCM calculation. Let me re-examine the conditions. \n\nThe 20% requires N divisible by 5. The 28% requires N divisible by 25. So LCM(5,25) is 25. So yes, N must be a multiple of 25. So the minimal N over 501 is 525. Since that's not an option, the answer is E. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something else. Let me check the problem again. It says \"more than 501 students\", so N must be at least 502. The first multiple of 25 after 501 is indeed 525 (since 500 is 20*25, so next is 21*25=525). So 525 is the smallest possible. Since none of the options are 525, the answer would be E. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A)550, B)570, C)600, D)700. None of these are 525, so yes, the answer is E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question requires that the percentages are exact and there's no overlap. Wait, but even if there's overlap, the counts must still be integers. So regardless of overlap, the total N must be a multiple of 25. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that 20% and 28% can't overlap? Wait, that's a different angle. Suppose that the students who took physics and math are separate. Then the total percentage would be 20+28=48%, but that's okay as long as N is big enough. But the problem doesn't state that the groups are exclusive. So even if there's overlap, the counts are okay as long as each group's count is an integer. \n\nHmm, so I think my initial reasoning is correct. The minimal N is 525, which isn't among the options. Therefore, the answer must be E.\n",
