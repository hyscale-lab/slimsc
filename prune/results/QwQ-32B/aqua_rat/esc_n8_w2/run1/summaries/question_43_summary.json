      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is asking for the reduction percentage when 120 is reduced to 96. Hmm, let's think. I remember that percentage decrease is calculated by taking the difference between the original and the new value, then dividing by the original, right? So first, I need to find how much it decreased. \n\nThe original number is 120, and it went down to 96. So the decrease is 120 minus 96. Let me calculate that: 120 - 96 equals 24. So the amount reduced is 24. \n\nNow, to find the percentage, I have to divide that 24 by the original amount, which is 120. Let me do that division. 24 divided by 120. Hmm, maybe simplify the fraction first. 24 over 120. Both are divisible by 24? Well, 24 divided by 24 is 1, and 120 divided by 24 is 5. So that's 1/5. Oh, right, 1/5 is 0.2 in decimal. To get the percentage, multiply by 100, so that's 20%. \n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option C is 20%, so that would be the answer? Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. The formula for percentage decrease is (Original - New)/Original * 100. So yes, exactly what I did. So (120-96)/120 *100 = 24/120 *100 = 20%. So option C. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate 24 divided by 120. 120 divided by 24 is 5, so 24 is a fifth of 120. So yeah, that's 20%. So the answer should be C. But wait, the options include B as 40%. Maybe I confused something. Let me check again. \n\nOriginal value is 120. Reduction is 24. So 24 divided by original (120) is 0.2, so 20%. So the percentage reduction is 20%, which is option C. Hmm, so why is there an option B as 40%? Maybe someone might think 24 is 20% of 120, so that's correct. So the correct answer is C. I think that's right.\n",

Wait, no, 120 divided by 5 is 24. So 24 is 1/5 of 120. And 1/5 as a percentage is 20%. Wait a second, but the options include 20% as option C. But hold on, I thought maybe 40%? Did I do that right?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the division. Let me check again. 24 divided by 120. Let's see: 24 divided by 120. Let me write it as a fraction: 24/120. Simplify that by dividing numerator and denominator by 24. 24 \u00f724 is 1, 120 \u00f724 is 5. So 1/5, which is 0.2, which is 20%. So that would be 20% reduction. So the answer should be C?\n\nBut wait, the options have B as 40%. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Oh! Wait, maybe I confused the formula. The formula is (Original - New)/Original *100. So (120-96)/120 *100. That's exactly what I did. So 24/120 is 0.2, so 20%. So the correct answer is C, 20%. \n\nHmm, but why do I have a feeling that sometimes people might think in terms of different percentages? Let me see another way. Suppose someone thought 96 is 80% of 120, which would mean a 20% reduction. Because 100% -20% =80%, so 120 *0.8 is 96. Exactly. So yes, that's correct. So the reduction is 20%, which is option C. Then why is there an option B at 40%? Maybe a common mistake is to subtract 96 from 120 and then divide by the new value instead of the original. Like 24/96, which would be 0.25 or 25%, but that's not an option here. Alternatively, maybe someone miscalculates 24/120 as 0.4, but that's 40%. How could that happen?\n\nWait, 24 divided by 120. Let me see: 24 divided by 120. Let me think in fractions. 24 over 120. If I divide numerator and denominator by 12, that's 2/10, which is 0.2. So no, that's 20%. Alternatively, maybe someone thought 120 to 96 is a 40% decrease because 96 is 40 less than 120? But 40% of 120 is 48, so that would be 120-48=72, which is not the case here. So perhaps the confusion comes from another angle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question, but I don't see how. The straightforward calculation gives 20%. So the correct answer must be C. The options given are A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, so yeah, C is the answer.\n",
