      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a cereal mixture with rice, wheat, and corn in the ratio 2:3:5. The question says that a bag has 3 pounds of rice, and we need to find out how much corn it contains. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this.\n\nFirst, the ratio given is 2:3:5 for rice, wheat, and corn respectively. So for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts wheat and 5 parts corn. The total parts would be 2 + 3 +5 =10 parts. But maybe I don't need the total. Let's think.\n\nThe problem gives the amount of rice as 3 pounds. The ratio of rice is 2 parts. So I need to find out how much each part is worth. Let me set up a proportion here. If 2 parts correspond to 3 pounds, then 1 part would be 3 divided by 2, which is 1.5 pounds. Then, since corn is 5 parts, multiplying 1.5 by 5 should give the corn's weight. Let me check that again.\n\nSo the ratio parts are 2:3:5. Rice is 2 parts = 3 lbs. So each part is 3/2 =1.5. Then corn is 5 parts, so 5 *1.5 =7.5. That would be 7.5 pounds. Looking at the options, B is 7.5. So the answer should be B? Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set it up as a ratio equation. Let's see. The ratio of rice to corn is 2:5. So, if rice is 3, then corn would be (5/2)*rice. That's exactly what I did before. 5/2 of 3 is (5/2)*3 = 15/2 =7.5. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, the options include B)7.5. So the answer should be B. Let me check the options again. The options are A)6.5, B)7.5, C)7, D)6, E) None. Since 7.5 is an option, B is correct. Therefore, the answer must be B.\n",

That means for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts wheat and 5 parts corn. The total parts would be 2+3+5=10 parts, but maybe I don't need the total. The key here is the relationship between rice and corn specifically.\n\nThe problem says there's 3 pounds of rice. The ratio of rice to corn is 2:5. So, the amount of rice is 2 parts, and corn is 5 parts. I need to find out how much corn there is when rice is 3 pounds. \n\nLet me set up a proportion here. If 2 parts correspond to 3 pounds, then 1 part must be 3/2 pounds. Then corn is 5 parts, so 5 multiplied by (3/2) would give the corn's weight. Let me calculate that: 5*(3/2) is 15/2, which is 7.5. So that would be 7.5 pounds of corn. Checking the options, B is 7.5. So the answer should be B?\n\nWait a second, maybe I should check if I interpreted the ratio correctly. The ratio is rice:wheat:corn = 2:3:5. So yes, rice is 2 parts, corn 5. The ratio between rice and corn is indeed 2:5, so the proportion should hold. So 2 parts rice corresponds to 3 pounds, so each part is 1.5 pounds. Then 5 parts corn would be 5 *1.5 =7.5. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think in terms of scaling the ratio. The original ratio is 2:3:5. Let the actual amounts be 2x, 3x, and 5x. Then the rice is 2x =3 pounds. Solving for x: x= 3/2=1.5. Then corn is 5x =5*(1.5)=7.5. Yep, that's the same result. So option B is correct. The options given include B as 7.5, so that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes here. The answer must be B.\n",
