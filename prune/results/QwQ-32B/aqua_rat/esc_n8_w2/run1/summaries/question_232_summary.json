      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many ounces the bag of cat food weighs when it's given as 7 pounds and 4 ounces. Hmm, right, the question is converting pounds to ounces. Let me remember, how many ounces are in a pound again? I think it's 16 ounces per pound. Yeah, that's right. So first, I should convert the pounds part into ounces and then add the remaining ounces.\n\nAlright, so 7 pounds times 16 ounces per pound. Let me do that math. 7 multiplied by 16. Let's see, 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 6 is 42, so 70 +42 is 112. So 7 pounds is 112 ounces. Then there's an extra 4 ounces. So adding that to the 112 gives 112 +4 = 116 ounces total. Wait, but let me double-check that multiplication. 16 times 7: 10*16 is 160, but no, wait, no, 7 times 16. Let me calculate again. 16*7: 10*7 is 70, 6*7 is 42, so 70+42 is 112. Yeah, that's correct. So adding the 4 ounces gives 116. Looking at the options, option C is 116. So the answer should be C. Let me check the options again. The options are A)108, B)112, C)116, D)120, E)124. Yep, so C is 116. That makes sense. I think that's right. Wait, could I have messed up the pounds to ounces conversion? Like, maybe it's 12 ounces in a pound? No, no, definitely 16. Because 1 pound is 16 ounces. So yeah, 7 pounds is 112 ounces, plus 4 is 116. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is C.\n",
