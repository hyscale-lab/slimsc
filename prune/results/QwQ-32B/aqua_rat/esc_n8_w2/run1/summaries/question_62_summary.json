      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this age problem. Hmm, the question says that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So, let me try to translate that into equations. \n\nLet me denote the ages of Q, R, and T as Q, R, and T respectively. The first part says Q is younger than R by some amount, and that same amount is how much older Q is than T. So, the difference between R and Q's age is the same as the difference between Q and T's age. \n\nSo, mathematically, that would mean R - Q = Q - T. Because if Q is younger than R by X years, then R is X older than Q. And Q is older than T by the same X years, so Q - T = X. So, those two differences are equal. So R - Q = Q - T. \n\nThen the problem states that the sum of R and T's ages is 50. So R + T = 50. \n\nThe question is asking for the definite difference between R and Q's age. So, we need to find R - Q, but I don't know if we can find an exact number here. Let me think.\n\nFrom the first equation, R - Q = Q - T. Let's rearrange that equation. If I add T to both sides and add Q to both sides, maybe? Let's see:\n\nR - Q = Q - T  \n=> R + T = 2Q. \n\nOh! Because adding Q and T to both sides gives R + T = 2Q. Wait, that's right. Because moving the Q to the right and T to the left gives R + T = 2Q. \n\nBut we also know from the problem that R + T = 50. So substituting that in, 50 = 2Q. Therefore, Q must be 25. \n\nSo Q's age is 25. Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q. Let's see. Let me denote the difference as D. So D = R - Q. Since R - Q equals Q - T, then D is equal to both. \n\nSince Q is 25, then R = Q + D, and T = Q - D. \n\nSo R + T = (Q + D) + (Q - D) = 2Q. Which checks out with the earlier equation. \n\nBut since R + T is 50, and 2Q is 50, so that's consistent. But we need to find D. \n\nWait, but how? Because with the given information, we can't find D's exact value. Because there are multiple possibilities. For example, suppose R is 30 and Q is 25, then T would be 20. Then R+T is 50. The difference D here is 5. But another scenario: if R is 35, Q is 25, T is 15. Then R+T is 50 again, but D is 10. So the difference could be any number as long as R and T add to 50 and Q is 25. \n\nTherefore, the difference between R and Q (which is D) can vary. The problem is asking for what is definitely the difference. Since there are multiple possible values for D, the answer must be that it cannot be determined. \n\nLooking at the options, D is \"Cannot be determined\" and E is \"None of the above\". Wait, but the options include D as an option. So the correct answer would be D? Because the problem says \"definitely the difference\", which we can't determine with the given information. \n\nWait, but let me check again. The problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. So the difference between R and Q is the same as between Q and T. But since R + T = 50 and Q is 25, but R and T can be any pair that adds to 50 with Q exactly in the middle. However, the actual difference R - Q could be any number as long as T is 50 - R, so the difference R - Q would be (R - 25), and T would be 50 - R, so Q - T is 25 - (50 - R) = R -25. So that works. \n\nSo the difference D is R -25, but R can be any value from just over 25 (so that T is less than 25) up to 49 (if T is 1). So D can be anything from 1 up to, like, 24.99 or so. So unless there are constraints that we haven't considered, the difference isn't fixed. \n\nHence the answer should be D) Cannot be determined. \n\nWait, but the options have E as \"None of the above\". Wait, the options are A to E, with D being \"Cannot be determined\". So the answer is D. So I think the correct answer is D. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWe have R - Q = Q - T. So R + T = 2Q. And R + T =50, so 2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25. The question is the difference between R and Q. The difference is (R - Q). But R could be anything, as long as T is 50 - R. So if R is 30, then T is 20, difference is 5. If R is 40, T is 10, difference is 15. So the difference isn't fixed. So yes, the answer is D. \n\nSo the options are D. The answer is D.\n",

The problem states that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. Hmm, that wording is a bit tricky. Let me parse it again. \n\nSo \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" That means the difference in age between Q and R is the same as the difference between Q and T, but in opposite directions. Like, if R is older than Q by X years, then Q is older than T by the same X years. So the age difference between R and Q is X, and between Q and T is also X. So R is X years older than Q, and Q is X years older than T. \n\nSo putting that into equations, maybe. Let me assign variables. Let's let Q's age be q, R's age be r, and T's age be t. \n\nThe first part says Q is younger than R by the same amount he is older than T. So the difference between R and Q is the same as the difference between Q and T. So:\n\nr - q = q - t \n\nThat's the equation. Because R is older than Q by (r-q), and Q is older than T by (q-t). So those two differences are equal.\n\nThe second part of the problem says the sum of the ages of R and T is 50. So r + t = 50. \n\nWe need to find the difference between R and Q's age. Wait, the question says \"What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\" Wait, but the options are numbers, so maybe they want the numerical difference. But let's see. \n\nSo from the first equation: r - q = q - t. Let me rearrange this equation. Let's see, adding t to both sides and adding q to both sides gives:\n\nr + t = 2q \n\nBecause if I have r - q = q - t, then adding q and t to both sides gives r + t = 2q. \n\nBut we also know from the problem that r + t =50. So substituting that in, 2q =50 \u2192 q=25. \n\nSo Q's age is 25. Then, the difference between R and Q's age is r - q, which is equal to q - t. \n\nBut since we know q is 25, then r -25 =25 - t. \n\nBut also, since r + t =50, we can write t =50 - r. \n\nSubstituting that into the equation: r -25 =25 - (50 - r). Let's compute the right side: 25 -50 + r \u2192 r -25. \n\nSo left side is r-25, right side is r-25. So this equation becomes r-25 = r-25, which is an identity. That means there's infinitely many solutions. \n\nWait, so that tells us that as long as r + t =50 and Q is 25, the differences can vary? Let me see. \n\nSuppose R is 30, then T would be 20. Then Q is 25. The difference between R and Q is 5, and between Q and T is 5. That works. \n\nAlternatively, if R is 40, T would be 10. Then Q is 25. The difference between R and Q is 15, and Q and T is 15.

So the difference between R and Q is (r - q), which is the same as (q - t). But since R + T =50, and Q is 25, but the individual ages of R and T can vary as long as their sum is 50. \n\nTherefore, the difference between R and Q can be any value as long as R is greater than Q and T is less than Q. So the difference isn't fixed. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Cannot be determined. \n\nWait, but let me check if maybe there's a different interpretation. The question says \"the difference between R and Q's age\". Since R is older than Q, that difference is r - q, which is equal to q - t. So adding those two equations: (r - q) + (q - t) = r - t. But since r + t =50, then r - t would be (r - t) = (r + t) - 2t =50-2t. Not sure that helps. Alternatively, the total difference between R and T would be (r - t) = 2(r - q), since r - q = q - t \u2192 r - t = 2(r - q). \n\nBut since R + T =50, then (R - T) can be expressed as 2(r - q).
