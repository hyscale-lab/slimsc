      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a shopkeeper and his servant's salary. The servant gets a base salary plus a commission. The question is asking how much the servant needs to sell each month so that his total income is 6000 rupees. Hmm.\n\nAlright, breaking it down. The servant's monthly salary is 1500. Plus, he gets 15% commission on the monthly sales. So his total income is the sum of these two. The target is 6000. \n\nLet me write the equation. Let the total sales be S. Then his commission would be 15% of S, which is 0.15 * S. Adding his base salary: 1500 + 0.15S = 6000. \n\nSo we need to solve for S. Subtract 1500 from both sides. 0.15S = 6000 - 1500. That's 0.15S = 4500. Then, divide both sides by 0.15 to get S. \n\nCalculating 4500 divided by 0.15. Let me do that. 0.15 is the same as 3/20, so dividing by 3/20 is multiplying by 20/3. 4500 * (20/3) = ?\n\nWait, maybe easier to do 4500 divided by 0.15. Let's see: 0.15 times 30,000 is 4500, because 0.15*30000 = 4500. Wait, 30000? Wait, no. Wait 0.15 * 30,000 would be 4500? Let me check:\n\n30,000 * 0.15: 30,000 * 0.1 is 3000, plus 30,000 * 0.05 which is 1500, so total 4500. Yes. So 0.15*30,000 = 4500. So S must be 30,000. \n\nWait but looking at the options, option A is 30,000. Option C is 31,500. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the math again.\n\nThe equation is: 1500 + 0.15S = 6000. \n\nSubtracting 1500 gives 0.15S = 4500. \n\nDivide both sides by 0.15:\n\nS = 4500 / 0.15. \n\nLet me compute this again. 4500 divided by 0.15. \n\nAlternatively, 0.15 is 15%, so 10% of 4500 would be 450, so 15% is 675. Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up.\n\nAlternatively, 4500 divided by 0.15: \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 100 to remove decimals: 450000 /15 = ?\n\n450000 divided by 15. 15 times 30,000 is 450,000. So yes, the result is 30,000. \n\nSo the required sales are 30,000. Which is option A. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A)30000, B)415000, C)31500, D)50000, E)None. \n\nHmm. So according to my calculation, the answer is A. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation? Let me see again.\n\nThe problem states that the servant wants his monthly income as 6000. His income is the base plus 15% of sales. So yes, the equation is correct. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the commission percentage? The problem says 15% commission on monthly sales. Yes. So 15% of S is correct. \n\nHmm. Then the answer should be A. But why is option C 31500? Maybe I miscalculated something. Wait, let me check again. \n\nWait 0.15 times 30,000 is indeed 4500. Adding the 1500 gives 6000. So that's correct. So the answer should be A. \n\nBut looking at the options, perhaps there's a trick here? Like maybe the commission is on profit instead of sales? But the question says \"monthly sale\", so it's on sales. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in Rupees, but that's the same unit. No, the numbers are straightforward. \n\nHmm. So I think the correct answer is A, which is 30,000. Therefore the answer should be option A. But let me check the options again. Yes, A is 30000. So the answer is A. \n\nWait, but the options given include C)31500. Let me see, maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me try plugging in option C. \n\nIf S is 31500, then commission is 0.15 *31500 = 4725. Adding 1500 gives 1500 +4725=6225, which is more than 6000. So that's not correct. \n\nSo the correct answer must be A. Therefore the answer is option A. So the correct choice is A.\n",

Hmm, 0.15 is the same as 3/20, so dividing by 3/20 is multiplying by 20/3. 4500 * 20 is 90,000. Then divided by 3 gives 30,000. Wait, so S is 30,000?\n\nLooking at the options. Option A is 30,000.
