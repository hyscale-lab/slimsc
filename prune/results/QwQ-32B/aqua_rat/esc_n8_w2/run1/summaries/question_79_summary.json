      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the weight of a new truck added to a group of vehicles so that the average weight increases. Hmm, I need to think through the steps carefully.\n\nAlright, the original average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. So the total weight of those 10 vehicles must be 10 multiplied by 12.2. Let me calculate that first. 10 times 12 is 120, and 10 times 0.2 is 2, so total is 122 tons. Got that part.\n\nNow, when the new truck is added, the number of vehicles becomes 11. The problem states that the average increased by 2.6 tons. Wait, so the new average is the original average plus 2.6. Let me confirm: the original average was 12.2, so the new average should be 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add those. 12 + 2 is 14, and 0.2 + 0.6 is 0.8, so total new average is 14.8 tons. \n\nWait, no. Wait a second, the question says \"the average weight of the group increased by 2.6 tons\". Oh right, so the increase is exactly 2.6. So the new average is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8. That's correct.\n\nNow, the new total weight would be the new average multiplied by the new number of vehicles, which is 11. So 14.8 times 11. Let me compute that. Hmm, 14 times 11 is 154, and 0.8 times 11 is 8.8. Adding those gives 154 + 8.8 = 162.8 tons total after adding the truck.\n\nThe original total was 122 tons. So the truck's weight must be the difference between the new total and the original. So 162.8 minus 122 equals... Let me subtract. 162.8 - 120 would be 42.8, but subtract another 2 gives 40.8? Wait, wait, 162.8 minus 122: 162.8 minus 120 is 42.8, then subtract the remaining 2, so 42.8 -2 = 40.8. Wait, that's 40.8 tons. Looking at the options, option A is 40.8. Hmm, but let me check again because I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait another way to approach: The increase in total weight is the truck's weight minus the original average. Because when you add a new element, the change in average can be thought of as (new element - old average)/(new count). Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps my first method is correct.\n\nLet me re-calculate the new total:\n\nOriginal total: 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.\n\nAfter adding the truck, total is 11 * (12.2 + 2.6) = 11 * 14.8. Let me compute 14.8 * 10 is 148, plus 14.8 is 162.8. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo the truck's weight is 162.8 - 122 = 40.8. So that's option A.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Because maybe I misread the question. The average increased by 2.6 tons. So original average 12.2, new average is 14.8. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the calculation steps. Let me do the subtraction again. 162.8 minus 122. 162.8 minus 120 is 42.8, minus 2 more is 40.8. So yes, that's right. So the answer should be A)40.8.\n\nHmm, but let me think another way. Suppose the truck's weight is T. The new average is (122 + T)/11 = 12.2 + 2.6 =14.8. So solving for T: (122 + T) = 14.8 *11. Which is exactly what I did before. So that's correct. So T= 162.8 -122 =40.8. So yes, option A is correct.\n\nWait, but the options given include 40.8 as option A, so that must be the right answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes when averages increase, sometimes the calculation is different. Let me confirm once again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the average increase. Let me see:\n\nOriginal average =12.2. After adding the truck, the average becomes 12.2 +2.6 =14.8. So the new average is 14.8. So the total after adding is 14.8 *11 =162.8. Subtract the original total (122) gives 40.8. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is A. Hmm, but I have to check the options again. The options are A)40.8, B)41.6, C)42.2, D)43.5, E)44.8. So A is there. So the answer should be A. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps?\n\nWait, let me compute 14.8 multiplied by 11 again. 14.8 *10 is 148, plus 14.8 is 162.8. Correct. 162.8 minus 122 is indeed 40.8. So yes, I think that's right. So the answer must be option A.\n",

But let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might mix up steps. Let me recalculate the new average again. Original average 12.2, increased by 2.6 gives 14.8. Correct.
