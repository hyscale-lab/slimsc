      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the interest rate when someone borrows 360 rupees and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of 31.50 each. Hmm, right. I need to figure out the interest rate here. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with installment payments, the total amount paid back is more than the principal, and the difference is the interest. So maybe I can calculate the total amount paid and subtract the principal to find the interest. Then use that to find the rate. \n\nLet me start by calculating the total amount he paid back. Since it's 12 installments of 31.50 each, that would be 12 multiplied by 31.50. Let me do that math: 12 * 30 is 360, but 12 * 1.5 is 18, so adding that gives 360 + 18 = 378. Wait, no, 31.5 times 12. Let me compute that again. 31.50 * 12. Let's break it down: 30*12 is 360, and 1.5*12 is 18. So total is 360 +18=378. So he paid back 378 total. The principal was 360, so the interest paid is 378-360 = 18 rupees. \n\nNow, the question is, what's the interest rate here? Since it's monthly installments over a year, I think the rate is annual. But wait, how is the interest calculated here? Is it simple interest or compound? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's simple interest. \n\nIf it's simple interest, the formula is I = P * R * T, where I is interest, P principal, R rate, T time. But the time here is one year since 12 months. The interest is 18, principal 360. So 18 = 360 * R * 1. Solving for R would give R = 18/(360) = 0.05, so 5%. That would be option D. \n\nWait a second, but maybe I'm oversimplifying. Because when paying in installments, especially monthly, the interest might be calculated differently. Like, maybe it's an installment loan where each payment reduces the principal. In that case, the simple interest approach might not be accurate. \n\nHmm, but the problem might be expecting the simple interest approach here because it's a basic question. Let me think again. Let's see: the total interest is 18 on 360 over a year. So 18/360 = 5% per annum. That's straightforward. But maybe the question is using simple interest, so D is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, if it's compound interest, but compounded monthly, that would be more complex. Let me check that possibility. But the problem doesn't mention compounding, so probably not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the calculation of the rate using the installment method. For example, in an installment loan, each payment includes interest on the remaining principal. But calculating that requires knowing the amortization schedule. Let's see if that approach gives the same answer. \n\nLet me try that approach. Let's see, the total principal is 360. Each month, he pays 31.50. Let me see how the principal reduces each month. \n\nThe first month, the payment of 31.50 would consist of interest plus principal. Let's assume the monthly interest rate is r. \n\nAt the end of first month, the interest would be 360 * r. The principal paid would be 31.50 - (360*r). \n\nThe remaining principal after first payment would be 360 - (31.50 - 360r) = 360 - 31.50 + 360r. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to set up an equation. The present value of all the payments should equal the loan amount. The present value of an annuity formula. \n\nAh, right! The correct way to calculate the interest rate for installments is using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. The formula is:\n\nPV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r]\n\nWhere PV is the present value (the loan amount), PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods (months).\n\nIn this case, PV is 360, PMT is 31.50, n is 12. We need to find r, then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate. \n\nBut solving for r in this equation might be tricky because it's not straightforward algebra. Maybe we can approximate or see which of the options fits. Let me check the options given. \n\nThe options are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%. These are all annual rates, so the monthly rates would be those divided by 12. Let me see which of these would make the present value equal to 360. \n\nLet me try option D, 5% annual. So monthly rate would be 5%/12 \u2248 0.0041667. \n\nLet me plug into the present value formula:\n\nPV = 31.50 * [1 - (1 + 0.0041667)^-12]/0.0041667 \n\nFirst compute (1 + 0.0041667)^12. Let's approximate. Since 0.0041667 is 1/240, but maybe better to compute step by step. \n\nAlternatively, since 0.0041667 is 5% per annum, the effective annual rate would be (1 + 0.05/12)^12 -1 \u2248 approximately 5.116%. But maybe I can compute the present value factor. \n\nAlternatively, let's compute the denominator first. Let me compute the numerator:\n\n[1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r \n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.0041667)^12 first. Let me compute ln(1.0041667) \u2248 0.004158. Multiply by 12 gives approx 0.05. So exponent is e^0.05 \u2248 1.05127. Wait, but actually (1 + 0.05/12)^12 is approximately e^0.05. So (1.0041667)^12 \u2248 e^0.05 \u2248 1.05127. \n\nTherefore, (1.0041667)^12 \u2248 1.05127. So 1/(1.0041667)^12 \u2248 1/1.05127 \u2248 0.95114. \n\nSo 1 - 0.95114 \u2248 0.04886. \n\nThen divide by r (0.0041667): 0.04886 /0.0041667 \u2248 11.727. \n\nMultiply by PMT (31.50): 31.5 * 11.727 \u2248 Let's see: 30 * 11.727 = 351.81, 1.5*11.727=17.59. Total \u2248 351.81 +17.59 = 369.4. \n\nHmm, but the PV should be 360. So that's higher than 360. So maybe 5% is too high. \n\nWait, so with the monthly rate of 5% annual, which is ~0.41666% per month, the present value is ~369.4, which is more than 360. That means that the actual rate is higher than 5% because a higher rate would reduce the present value. \n\nWait, the PV formula is inversely related to the interest rate. So if at 5% the PV is higher than 360, then to get a lower PV (360), we need a higher rate. \n\nHmm. Let's try the next option: 10% annual. Let's see. \n\nIf the annual rate is 10%, then the monthly rate is 10/12 \u2248 0.8333% per month. \n\nSo r = 0.0083333. \n\nCompute (1 + 0.0083333)^12. Let's see, 1.008333^12. Let me compute this. \n\nAlternatively, 1.0083333^12 \u2248 e^(0.0083333*12) = e^0.1 \u2248 1.10517. So 1/(1.008333)^12 \u2248 1/1.10517 \u2248 0.9049. \n\nThen 1 - 0.9049 \u2248 0.0951. \n\nDivide by r (0.0083333): 0.0951 / 0.0083333 \u2248 11.412. \n\nMultiply by 31.50: 11.412 *31.5. Let's see, 10*31.5=315, 1.412*31.5\u224844.5. Total \u2248 315+44.5=359.5. That's very close to 360. \n\nSo if the monthly rate is 10%/12 \u2248 0.8333%, then the present value is approximately 359.5, which is very close to 360. So the annual rate would be 10%, so option C. But wait the options have 10% as option C, but the options given in the question are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%. \n\nWait but according to this calculation, 10% annual gives a PV close to 360. But that would mean the answer is C. But the first method with simple interest gave D)5%. \n\nHmm, so now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? \n\nThe problem is that the question is ambiguous. If it's simple interest, the answer is 5%. But if it's compound interest with monthly installments (i.e., using the present value of annuity), then 10% is the correct answer. \n\nBut which one does the question expect? Since the options include 10% and 5%, I need to figure out which method is appropriate here. \n\nThe question says \"interest rate\" without specifying, but in typical loan calculations, the interest rate is the annual rate used in the present value of the installments. Because otherwise, if it's simple interest, the total interest is 18, so 18/360 is 5%, so 5% simple. \n\nBut maybe the question is expecting simple interest. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using simple interest per month. Let me think. \n\nSuppose the total interest is 18 over one year. So simple interest rate would be (18/360)*100 =5%. \n\nBut in the case of installments, the principal decreases each month. So the simple interest approach would overstate the actual interest. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not considering the time value of money, so they just compute total interest over principal. That would be simple interest. \n\nIn many basic problems, especially in exams, sometimes they use simple interest unless stated otherwise. So maybe the answer is D)5%. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using the concept of the rate per annum where each payment is equally divided, but that's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, let me check the total amount paid. 12 *31.50=378. The principal is 360, so interest is 18. \n\nIf it's simple interest over a year, then the rate is 5%. \n\nBut in reality, when paying monthly, the interest is charged on the remaining principal each month. So the actual interest would be less than 18? Wait no, because each payment reduces the principal, so the interest is calculated on a reducing balance. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nSuppose the interest is simple, but calculated on the original principal for the whole year. Then total interest would be 360 * r *1. So yes, 18 = 360 * r \u2192 r=5%. \n\nAlternatively, if it's simple interest but with the payments being monthly, then the total interest is the same. \n\nBut in reality, loans are usually compound interest, so the correct method is the present value approach, leading to 10%. But the options have 10% as C, but that would be the case here. \n\nHmm, but why the discrepancy? Let me try with the 10% rate. \n\nWait, when I calculated with 10% annual rate (monthly 0.8333%), the present value came out as about 359.5, which is very close to 360. So that would be the correct answer. \n\nBut why does the simple interest method give a different answer? \n\nBecause in the simple interest method, the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period, but in reality, since the principal is being paid down each month, the actual interest should be less than that. Wait no, in the case of monthly installments, the interest is calculated on the remaining principal each month. So the total interest would be less than simple interest on the original principal. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose the interest is simple but calculated as total over the year. Then the total interest would be 5%, but in reality, when paying installments, the interest is calculated each month on the outstanding principal. So the total interest would be less than 5%? Or more?\n\nWait let's think of an example. Let's say the loan is 360, 10% annual rate, monthly payments. \n\nIf the monthly rate is 10%/12=0.8333%, then the total interest would be the sum of the interest portions each month. Let me calculate the first month's interest: 360 * 0.008333 \u2248 3. So the first payment of 31.50 would have 3 interest and 28.5 principal. \n\nThe new principal is 360 -28.5 = 331.5. \n\nSecond month's interest: 331.5 *0.008333 \u2248 ~2.7625. So payment is 31.50, so principal reduction is 31.50 -2.7625 = 28.7375. \n\nContinuing this way, the total interest would be sum of all interest parts. \n\nAlternatively, the total payments are 12 *31.50 =378, so total interest is 18. \n\nWait, but if the rate is 10%, then the present value is about 360. So the total interest is 378-360=18. \n\nWait but that's the same as the simple interest case. Hmm. \n\nWait, so if the present value calculation gives that the 10% rate is needed to get the PV of 378 to be 360, then the total interest is indeed 18, but that's the same as the simple interest approach. \n\nWait, but how does that make sense? Because in the amortization schedule, the total interest would be the same as the total payments minus principal. \n\nAh right, regardless of the interest calculation method, the total interest is always total payments minus principal. So in this case, the total interest is 18. \n\nThe difference between the methods is in how the interest is distributed over the months, but the total is fixed. \n\nTherefore, the question must be asking for the rate that results in total interest of 18 over a year. \n\nWait, but how is the interest rate defined here? \n\nIn simple interest, the rate would be 18/360 =5%. \n\nIn compound interest, the rate would be higher? Or lower? \n\nWait, but if you have a simple interest rate of 5%, then the total interest is 5% of 360, which is 18. \n\nBut in the case of compound interest (or monthly compounding), the interest would be higher. But here, the total interest is exactly 18, which is the same as simple interest. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is assuming simple interest. Because the options include 5%, which would be the simple interest rate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the rate as the simple interest rate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a perspective where the interest is computed as total interest divided by principal divided by time, so 18/(360*1) =0.05, so 5% per annum. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be D)5%. \n\nBut why did the present value calculation give 10% as the rate needed to get the PV? \n\nAh, because the present value approach assumes that each payment is discounted by the interest rate. So if the rate is 10%, the PV of the payments equals the loan amount. \n\nWait, but the total interest is still 18. So the confusion here is between the nominal rate and the simple interest rate. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is using the simple interest approach. Let me see what the options are. \n\nThe options given are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%. \n\nIf the simple interest is 5%, that's option D. \n\nAlternatively, if the question is expecting the effective annual rate calculated through the installment method, then 10% would be the answer. \n\nBut maybe the question is from an Indian context, and in some educational materials, they might compute it as simple interest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that each monthly payment is simple interest on the average principal. \n\nAlternatively, let's see: \n\nAnother approach: The total amount paid is 378. The interest is 18. \n\nIf it's simple interest, then the rate is (18/360)*100 =5%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the simple interest rate. Since that's straightforward, and the other approach requires more complex calculations which might be beyond the scope of the question. \n\nThe options include 5%, so that's likely the answer. \n\nWait, but why did the present value approach with 10% give a PV close to 360? Because in that case, the interest rate is 10% annual, but the total interest is still 18. \n\nWait, that's because the present value formula accounts for the timing of the payments. So when you have a higher rate, the present value of the payments is lower. So to get the present value of the payments equal to 360, you need a higher rate. \n\nBut the total interest paid is still 378 -360 =18. So the total interest is fixed, but the rate is different depending on the method. \n\nWait, that's conflicting. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to clarify the definitions. \n\nThe interest rate in an installment loan is typically the rate that equates the present value of payments to the loan amount. So that would be the correct approach. \n\nTherefore, the correct rate would be 10% per annum. \n\nBut why does that calculation give the PV as 360? Let me recalculate that. \n\nWait earlier I approximated (1 + 0.008333)^12 as e^0.1 \u2248 1.10517. But actually, let me compute (1 + 0.1/12)^12 precisely. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for present value of annuity: \n\nPV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n]/r \n\nLet me plug in r =0.10/12 =0.0083333, n=12. \n\nCalculate numerator: 1 - (1.0083333)^-12 \n\nFirst compute (1.0083333)^12: \n\nLet me compute step by step. \n\n1.0083333^1 =1.0083333 \n\n^2: 1.0083333 *1.0083333 = approx 1.016736 \n\n^3: 1.016736 *1.008333 \u22481.016736+ (1.016736*0.008333) \u2248 ~1.016736 +0.008472\u22481.0252 \n\n^4: 1.0252 *1.008333 \u2248 1.0252+ (1.0252 *0.008333) \u2248 ~1.0252+0.008543\u22481.0337 \n\nContinuing this step-by-step up to 12 terms would be tedious, but perhaps using logarithms or a better approximation. \n\nAlternatively, use the formula (1 + r)^n = e^{n ln(1 + r)}. \n\nr =0.0083333. ln(1.0083333) \u22480.00829. \n\nMultiply by 12: 0.00829 *12 =0.09948 \n\nExponentiate: e^0.09948 \u22481.1047. \n\nSo (1.008333)^12 \u22481.1047. \n\nTherefore, (1.008333)^-12 \u22481/1.1047 \u22480.9053. \n\nSo 1 - 0.9053 =0.0947. \n\nDivide by r: 0.0947 /0.0083333 \u224811.364. \n\nMultiply by 31.50: 11.364 *31.50. \n\nLet me compute 11 *31.50 =346.5 \n\n0.364*31.5 \u2248 11.466 \n\nTotal is 346.5+11.466=357.966. \n\nHmm, so approximately 358. Which is close to 360 but not exact. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my approximation is off. Maybe the exact calculation would get closer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the exact rate is a bit higher than 10% to get to 360. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects simple interest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the total interest divided by the principal and divided by the time in years (1 year), so 18/360 =0.05, so 5%. \n\nThat's straightforward. \n\nSince the question is a multiple-choice and 5% is an option, and the other method requires more complex calculation which might not be expected here, perhaps the answer is D)5%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the simple interest rate. \n\nIn that case, the answer is D. \n\nBut the present value approach gives a higher rate. \n\nHmm, but let me think again. \n\nThe problem says \"interest rate\"\u2014without any other context. \n\nIn simple interest, the formula is I = PRT. So here, 18 = 360 * R *1 \u2192 R=5%. \n\nIn the case of compound interest with monthly payments, the rate is higher. But the question might not require that. \n\nSince it's a basic question, likely expecting simple interest. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D)5%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the interest rate, first calculate the total amount paid back: 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 amount to \\(12 \\times 31.50 = 378\\) rupees.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the interest rate when someone borrows 360 rupees and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of 31.50 each. Hmm, right. I need to figure out the interest rate here. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with installment payments, the total amount paid back is more than the principal, and the difference is the interest. So maybe I can calculate the total amount paid and subtract the principal to find the interest. Then use that to find the rate. \n\nLet me start by calculating the total amount he paid back. Since it's 12 installments of 31.50 each, that would be 12 multiplied by 31.50. Let me do that math: 12 * 30 is 360, but 12 * 1.5 is 18, so adding that gives 360 + 18 = 378. Wait, no, 31.5 times 12. Let me compute that again. 31.50 * 12. Let's break it down: 30*12 is 360, and 1.5*12 is 18. So total is 360 +18=378. So he paid back 378 total. The principal was 360, so the interest paid is 378-360 = 18 rupees. \n\nNow, the question is, what's the interest rate here? Since it's monthly installments over a year, I think the rate is annual. But wait, how is the interest calculated here? Is it simple interest or compound? The problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's simple interest. \n\nIf it's simple interest, the formula is I = P * R * T, where I is interest, P principal, R rate, T time. But the time here is one year since 12 months. The interest is 18, principal 360. So 18 = 360 * R * 1. Solving for R would give R = 18/(360) = 0.05, so 5%. That would be option D. \n\nWait a second, but maybe I'm oversimplifying. Because when paying in installments, especially monthly, the interest might be calculated differently. Like, maybe it's an installment loan where each payment reduces the principal. In that case, the simple interest approach might not be accurate. \n\nHmm, but the problem might be expecting the simple interest approach here because it's a basic question. Let me think again. Let's see: the total interest is 18 on 360 over a year. So 18/360 = 5% per annum. That's straightforward. But maybe the question is using simple interest, so D is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, if it's compound interest, but compounded monthly, that would be more complex. Let me check that possibility. But the problem doesn't mention compounding, so probably not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the calculation of the rate using the installment method. For example, in an installment loan, each payment includes interest on the remaining principal. But calculating that requires knowing the amortization schedule. Let's see if that approach gives the same answer. \n\nLet me try that approach. Let's see, the total principal is 360. Each month, he pays 31.50. Let me see how the principal reduces each month. \n\nThe first month, the payment of 31.50 would consist of interest plus principal. Let's assume the monthly interest rate is r. \n\nAt the end of first month, the interest would be 360 * r. The principal paid would be 31.50 - (360*r). \n\nThe remaining principal after first payment would be 360 - (31.50 - 360r) = 360 - 31.50 + 360r. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to set up an equation. The present value of all the payments should equal the loan amount. The present value of an annuity formula. \n\nAh, right! The correct way to calculate the interest rate for installments is using the present value of an ordinary annuity formula. The formula is:\n\nPV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r]\n\nWhere PV is the present value (the loan amount), PMT is the monthly payment, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods (months).\n\nIn this case, PV is 360, PMT is 31.50, n is 12. We need to find r, then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate. \n\nBut solving for r in this equation might be tricky because it's not straightforward algebra. Maybe we can approximate or see which of the options fits. Let me check the options given. \n\nThe options are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%. These are all annual rates, so the monthly rates would be those divided by 12. Let me see which of these would make the present value equal to 360. \n\nLet me try option D, 5% annual. So monthly rate would be 5%/12 \u2248 0.0041667. \n\nLet me plug into the present value formula:\n\nPV = 31.50 * [1 - (1 + 0.0041667)^-12]/0.0041667 \n\nFirst compute (1 + 0.0041667)^12. Let's approximate. Since 0.0041667 is 1/240, but maybe better to compute step by step. \n\nAlternatively, since 0.0041667 is 5% per annum, the effective annual rate would be (1 + 0.05/12)^12 -1 \u2248 approximately 5.116%. But maybe I can compute the present value factor. \n\nAlternatively, let's compute the denominator first. Let me compute the numerator:\n\n[1 - (1 + r)^-n] / r \n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.0041667)^12 first. Let me compute ln(1.0041667) \u2248 0.004158. Multiply by 12 gives approx 0.05. So exponent is e^0.05 \u2248 1.05127. Wait, but actually (1 + 0.05/12)^12 is approximately e^0.05. So (1.0041667)^12 \u2248 e^0.05 \u2248 1.05127. \n\nTherefore, (1.0041667)^12 \u2248 1.05127. So 1/(1.0041667)^12 \u2248 1/1.05127 \u2248 0.95114. \n\nSo 1 - 0.95114 \u2248 0.04886. \n\nThen divide by r (0.0041667): 0.04886 /0.0041667 \u2248 11.727. \n\nMultiply by PMT (31.50): 31.5 * 11.727 \u2248 Let's see: 30 * 11.727 = 351.81, 1.5*11.727=17.59. Total \u2248 351.81 +17.59 = 369.4. \n\nHmm, but the PV should be 360. So that's higher than 360. So maybe 5% is too high. \n\nWait, so with the monthly rate of 5% annual, which is ~0.41666% per month, the present value is ~369.4, which is more than 360. That means that the actual rate is higher than 5% because a higher rate would reduce the present value. \n\nWait, the PV formula is inversely related to the interest rate. So if at 5% the PV is higher than 360, then to get a lower PV (360), we need a higher rate. \n\nHmm. Let's try the next option: 10% annual. Let's see. \n\nIf the annual rate is 10%, then the monthly rate is 10/12 \u2248 0.8333% per month. \n\nSo r = 0.0083333. \n\nCompute (1 + 0.0083333)^12. Let's see, 1.008333^12. Let me compute this. \n\nAlternatively, 1.0083333^12 \u2248 e^(0.0083333*12) = e^0.1 \u2248 1.10517. So 1/(1.008333)^12 \u2248 1/1.10517 \u2248 0.9049. \n\nThen 1 - 0.9049 \u2248 0.0951. \n\nDivide by r (0.0083333): 0.0951 / 0.0083333 \u2248 11.412. \n\nMultiply by 31.50: 11.412 *31.5. Let's see, 10*31.5=315, 1.412*31.5\u224844.5. Total \u2248 315+44.5=359.5. That's very close to 360. \n\nSo if the monthly rate is 10%/12 \u2248 0.8333%, then the present value is approximately 359.5, which is very close to 360. So the annual rate would be 10%, so option C. But wait the options have 10% as option C, but the options given in the question are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%. \n\nWait but according to this calculation, 10% annual gives a PV close to 360. But that would mean the answer is C. But the first method with simple interest gave D)5%. \n\nHmm, so now I'm confused. Which approach is correct? \n\nThe problem is that the question is ambiguous. If it's simple interest, the answer is 5%. But if it's compound interest with monthly installments (i.e., using the present value of annuity), then 10% is the correct answer. \n\nBut which one does the question expect? Since the options include 10% and 5%, I need to figure out which method is appropriate here. \n\nThe question says \"interest rate\" without specifying, but in typical loan calculations, the interest rate is the annual rate used in the present value of the installments. Because otherwise, if it's simple interest, the total interest is 18, so 18/360 is 5%, so 5% simple. \n\nBut maybe the question is expecting simple interest. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using simple interest per month. Let me think. \n\nSuppose the total interest is 18 over one year. So simple interest rate would be (18/360)*100 =5%. \n\nBut in the case of installments, the principal decreases each month. So the simple interest approach would overstate the actual interest. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not considering the time value of money, so they just compute total interest over principal. That would be simple interest. \n\nIn many basic problems, especially in exams, sometimes they use simple interest unless stated otherwise. So maybe the answer is D)5%. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using the concept of the rate per annum where each payment is equally divided, but that's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, let me check the total amount paid. 12 *31.50=378. The principal is 360, so interest is 18. \n\nIf it's simple interest over a year, then the rate is 5%. \n\nBut in reality, when paying monthly, the interest is charged on the remaining principal each month. So the actual interest would be less than 18? Wait no, because each payment reduces the principal, so the interest is calculated on a reducing balance. \n\nWait, let's see: \n\nSuppose the interest is simple, but calculated on the original principal for the whole year. Then total interest would be 360 * r *1. So yes, 18 = 360 * r \u2192 r=5%. \n\nAlternatively, if it's simple interest but with the payments being monthly, then the total interest is the same. \n\nBut in reality, loans are usually compound interest, so the correct method is the present value approach, leading to 10%. But the options have 10% as C, but that would be the case here. \n\nHmm, but why the discrepancy? Let me try with the 10% rate. \n\nWait, when I calculated with 10% annual rate (monthly 0.8333%), the present value came out as about 359.5, which is very close to 360. So that would be the correct answer. \n\nBut why does the simple interest method give a different answer? \n\nBecause in the simple interest method, the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period, but in reality, since the principal is being paid down each month, the actual interest should be less than that. Wait no, in the case of monthly installments, the interest is calculated on the remaining principal each month. So the total interest would be less than simple interest on the original principal. \n\nWait, let me think again. \n\nSuppose the interest is simple but calculated as total over the year. Then the total interest would be 5%, but in reality, when paying installments, the interest is calculated each month on the outstanding principal. So the total interest would be less than 5%? Or more?\n\nWait let's think of an example. Let's say the loan is 360, 10% annual rate, monthly payments. \n\nIf the monthly rate is 10%/12=0.8333%, then the total interest would be the sum of the interest portions each month. Let me calculate the first month's interest: 360 * 0.008333 \u2248 3. So the first payment of 31.50 would have 3 interest and 28.5 principal. \n\nThe new principal is 360 -28.5 = 331.5. \n\nSecond month's interest: 331.5 *0.008333 \u2248 ~2.7625. So payment is 31.50, so principal reduction is 31.50 -2.7625 = 28.7375. \n\nContinuing this way, the total interest would be sum of all interest parts. \n\nAlternatively, the total payments are 12 *31.50 =378, so total interest is 18. \n\nWait, but if the rate is 10%, then the present value is about 360. So the total interest is 378-360=18. \n\nWait but that's the same as the simple interest case. Hmm. \n\nWait, so if the present value calculation gives that the 10% rate is needed to get the PV of 378 to be 360, then the total interest is indeed 18, but that's the same as the simple interest approach. \n\nWait, but how does that make sense? Because in the amortization schedule, the total interest would be the same as the total payments minus principal. \n\nAh right, regardless of the interest calculation method, the total interest is always total payments minus principal. So in this case, the total interest is 18. \n\nThe difference between the methods is in how the interest is distributed over the months, but the total is fixed. \n\nTherefore, the question must be asking for the rate that results in total interest of 18 over a year. \n\nWait, but how is the interest rate defined here? \n\nIn simple interest, the rate would be 18/360 =5%. \n\nIn compound interest, the rate would be higher? Or lower? \n\nWait, but if you have a simple interest rate of 5%, then the total interest is 5% of 360, which is 18. \n\nBut in the case of compound interest (or monthly compounding), the interest would be higher. But here, the total interest is exactly 18, which is the same as simple interest. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is assuming simple interest. Because the options include 5%, which would be the simple interest rate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the rate as the simple interest rate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a perspective where the interest is computed as total interest divided by principal divided by time, so 18/(360*1) =0.05, so 5% per annum. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be D)5%. \n\nBut why did the present value calculation give 10% as the rate needed to get the PV? \n\nAh, because the present value approach assumes that each payment is discounted by the interest rate. So if the rate is 10%, the PV of the payments equals the loan amount. \n\nWait, but the total interest is still 18. So the confusion here is between the nominal rate and the simple interest rate. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is using the simple interest approach. Let me see what the options are. \n\nThe options given are A)1.5%, B)4.5%, C)10%, D)5%, E)12%. \n\nIf the simple interest is 5%, that's option D. \n\nAlternatively, if the question is expecting the effective annual rate calculated through the installment method, then 10% would be the answer. \n\nBut maybe the question is from an Indian context, and in some educational materials, they might compute it as simple interest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that each monthly payment is simple interest on the average principal. \n\nAlternatively, let's see: \n\nAnother approach: The total amount paid is 378. The interest is 18. \n\nIf it's simple interest, then the rate is (18/360)*100 =5%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the simple interest rate. Since that's straightforward, and the other approach requires more complex calculations which might be beyond the scope of the question. \n\nThe options include 5%, so that's likely the answer. \n\nWait, but why did the present value approach with 10% give a PV close to 360? Because in that case, the interest rate is 10% annual, but the total interest is still 18. \n\nWait, that's because the present value formula accounts for the timing of the payments. So when you have a higher rate, the present value of the payments is lower. So to get the present value of the payments equal to 360, you need a higher rate. \n\nBut the total interest paid is still 378 -360 =18. So the total interest is fixed, but the rate is different depending on the method. \n\nWait, that's conflicting. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to clarify the definitions. \n\nThe interest rate in an installment loan is typically the rate that equates the present value of payments to the loan amount. So that would be the correct approach. \n\nTherefore, the correct rate would be 10% per annum. \n\nBut why does that calculation give the PV as 360? Let me recalculate that. \n\nWait earlier I approximated (1 + 0.008333)^12 as e^0.1 \u2248 1.10517. But actually, let me compute (1 + 0.1/12)^12 precisely. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for present value of annuity: \n\nPV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n]/r \n\nLet me plug in r =0.10/12 =0.0083333, n=12. \n\nCalculate numerator: 1 - (1.0083333)^-12 \n\nFirst compute (1.0083333)^12: \n\nLet me compute step by step. \n\n1.0083333^1 =1.0083333 \n\n^2: 1.0083333 *1.0083333 = approx 1.016736 \n\n^3: 1.016736 *1.008333 \u22481.016736+ (1.016736*0.008333) \u2248 ~1.016736 +0.008472\u22481.0252 \n\n^4: 1.0252 *1.008333 \u2248 1.0252+ (1.0252 *0.008333) \u2248 ~1.0252+0.008543\u22481.0337 \n\nContinuing this step-by-step up to 12 terms would be tedious, but perhaps using logarithms or a better approximation. \n\nAlternatively, use the formula (1 + r)^n = e^{n ln(1 + r)}. \n\nr =0.0083333. ln(1.0083333) \u22480.00829. \n\nMultiply by 12: 0.00829 *12 =0.09948 \n\nExponentiate: e^0.09948 \u22481.1047. \n\nSo (1.008333)^12 \u22481.1047. \n\nTherefore, (1.008333)^-12 \u22481/1.1047 \u22480.9053. \n\nSo 1 - 0.9053 =0.0947. \n\nDivide by r: 0.0947 /0.0083333 \u224811.364. \n\nMultiply by 31.50: 11.364 *31.50. \n\nLet me compute 11 *31.50 =346.5 \n\n0.364*31.5 \u2248 11.466 \n\nTotal is 346.5+11.466=357.966. \n\nHmm, so approximately 358. Which is close to 360 but not exact. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my approximation is off. Maybe the exact calculation would get closer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the exact rate is a bit higher than 10% to get to 360. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects simple interest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the total interest divided by the principal and divided by the time in years (1 year), so 18/360 =0.05, so 5%. \n\nThat's straightforward. \n\nSince the question is a multiple-choice and 5% is an option, and the other method requires more complex calculation which might not be expected here, perhaps the answer is D)5%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the simple interest rate. \n\nIn that case, the answer is D. \n\nBut the present value approach gives a higher rate. \n\nHmm, but let me think again. \n\nThe problem says \"interest rate\"\u2014without any other context. \n\nIn simple interest, the formula is I = PRT. So here, 18 = 360 * R *1 \u2192 R=5%. \n\nIn the case of compound interest with monthly payments, the rate is higher. But the question might not require that. \n\nSince it's a basic question, likely expecting simple interest. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is D)5%.\n\n\nTo determine the interest rate, first calculate the total amount paid back: 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 amount to \\(12 \\times 31.50 = 378\\) rupees. The principal borrowed is Rs.360, so the total interest paid is \\(378 - 360 = 18\\) rupees. \n\nUsing the simple interest formula \\(I = P \\times R \\times T\\), where \\(I = 18\\), \\(P = 360\\), and \\(T = 1\\) year, solve for \\(R\\):\n\\[\n18 = 360 \\times R \\times 1 \\implies R = \\frac{18}{360} = 0.05 \\text{ or } 5\\%.\n\\]\n\nWhile the present value of an annuity method could also be considered, the problem likely expects a straightforward simple interest calculation given the options and typical exam contexts. The simple interest approach directly yields 5%, which matches option D. \n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about finding the interest rate when someone borrows money and pays it back in installments. Hmm, so the man borrows Rs. 360 and pays it back over 12 months with each installment being Rs.31.50. The options are given, so maybe I can figure this out by calculating the total amount paid and then the interest rate.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how interest rates work with installment payments. Wait, is this simple interest or compound interest? Since it's monthly installments, maybe it's simple interest? Or perhaps it's using an amortization method? Hmm, the question might be assuming simple interest, but I should think carefully.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total amount he pays back. Since there are 12 monthly payments of Rs.31.50 each, the total repayment is 12 multiplied by 31.50. Let me do that math: 12 * 30 is 360, but then 12 * 1.5 is 18, so total would be 360 + 18 = 378. So he pays back 378 in total. \n\nThe principal is 360, so the total interest paid is 378 - 360 = 18 rupees. Now, to find the interest rate, I need to see what percentage this interest is of the principal over the period. Since it's a year (12 months), the time is 1 year. \n\nIf it's simple interest, then the formula is I = P * R * T. Here, I is 18, P is 360, T is 1. So solving for R: R = I/(P*T) = 18/(360*1) = 0.05, which is 5%. Wait, but that would be option D. But let me think again\u2014maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the rate to be per annum but calculated differently. Because sometimes with installments, the interest might be calculated on reducing balance, which would be compound interest. But in that case, the calculation would be more complex. But since the problem gives simple options, perhaps it's expecting the simple interest approach.\n\nWait, let me check. Let's see: if the total interest is Rs.18, then 18 divided by 360 is 0.05, so 5%. That would be D. But let me check the options again. The options are A)1.5, B)4.5, C)10, D)5, E)12. So D is an option. Hmm, but maybe I need to confirm if the question is asking for the rate per annum, which it probably is. So that would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering something else. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the problem is that the installments are paid monthly, so the interest is compounded monthly? Then the calculation would be different. Let me see.\n\nIf the interest is compounded monthly, the formula would be different. The total amount after 12 months would be P*(1 + r/12)^12, but in this case, he's paying monthly installments. That complicates things because each payment reduces the principal. So perhaps the simple interest approach isn't accurate here. \n\nHmm, maybe I should think of it as the total interest over the period. The total amount paid is 378. So the interest is 18. The principal is 360. So the rate would be (18/360)*100 = 5%, which is D. But why is option B (4.5%) there? Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the rate to be calculated as simple interest but considering the average principal. Because in installments, the principal decreases each month. The average amount owed would be (360 + 0)/2 = 180. Then total interest would be 18 = (360 * r * t)/2? Wait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the total interest in an installment plan with equal payments can sometimes be calculated as the total payments minus principal divided by principal, then annualized. Let me see. \n\nTotal interest is 18, so (18/360)*100 = 5% per annum. That seems straightforward, so the answer should be D)5%. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is using a different method. Let me check another approach. Suppose the interest is calculated on a monthly basis. Let's see. Let me try to model the payments as an annuity. \n\nThe present value of the installments should equal the loan amount. So using the present value of an annuity formula: \n\nPV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]\n\nWhere PV is 360, PMT is 31.50, n is 12, and r is the monthly interest rate. \n\nWe can solve for r here, but since the options are annual rates, we would need to multiply the monthly rate by 12 to get the annual rate. \n\nHmm, this might be more accurate. Let me try plugging in the numbers. Let me see if I can find the monthly rate. \n\nLet me rearrange the formula to solve for r. \n\n360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nThis equation might be a bit tricky to solve algebraically, so perhaps trial and error with the options given. \n\nLet me check if 5% annual rate, so monthly rate would be 5%/12 \u2248 0.4167% per month. \n\nLet me compute the present value with r = 0.0041667 (5%/12):\n\nFirst, compute (1 + 0.0041667)^-12 \u2248 1/(1.0041667)^12. Let me approximate:\n\n1.0041667^12 is approximately e^(0.0041667*12) \u2248 e^0.05 \u2248 1.05127. So reciprocal is about 0.951. \n\nSo (1 - 0.951) = 0.049. Then 0.049 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.76. Multiply by 31.50: 31.50 * 11.76 \u2248 31.5 * 12 = 378, minus some, like 31.5*(12-0.24)= 31.5*(11.76) = let's see 31.5 * 11 = 346.5, plus 31.5*0.76 \u2248 24. So total \u2248 346.5 +24= 370.5, but that's not 360. Hmm, so that suggests that the present value with 5% annual rate is higher than 360. Wait, maybe my approximation was off. \n\nAlternatively, let me try with 4.5% annual rate, so monthly rate 0.375% (4.5/12=0.375). \n\nr = 0.00375. \n\nCompute (1 + 0.00375)^-12. Let's compute (1.00375)^12. \n\nApproximate using logarithms: ln(1.00375) \u2248 0.00374. Multiply by 12 gives 0.0449. So exponent is e^0.0449 \u2248 1.046. So reciprocal is 1/1.046 \u2248 0.956. \n\nThen 1 - 0.956 = 0.044. Divide by 0.00375: 0.044 / 0.00375 \u2248 11.73. Multiply by 31.50: 31.5 * 11.73. Let's calculate 31.5*10=315, plus 31.5*1.73=54.405. Total 315 +54.405=369.405. Still higher than 360. Hmm. \n\nWait, the present value should be 360. Maybe I need a higher rate. Let's try 6% annual rate. Monthly 0.5%. \n\nr=0.005. \n\n(1.005)^12 \u2248 1.0617, so reciprocal is ~0.9418. \n\n1-0.9418=0.0582. \n\n0.0582 /0.005 = 11.64. \n\n31.5 *11.64 = 31.5*10=315 +31.5*1.64=51.66 \u2192 total 366.66. Still higher than 360. \n\nHmm. Wait, maybe I'm going the wrong way. Let me try 7% annual (monthly 0.5833%). \n\nr=0.0058333. \n\n(1.005833)^12 \u2248 1.0723. So reciprocal is ~0.932. \n\n1-0.932=0.068. \n\n0.068 /0.0058333 \u2248 11.66. \n\n31.5*11.66 \u2248 31.5*11 + 31.5*0.66=346.5 +20.8=367.3. Still over. \n\nHmm, maybe my approach is wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is indeed expecting the simple interest method, so the answer is 5%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the total interest is 18, so 18/360 is 5%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated as simple interest over the year, so that's the correct approach. Since the options include 5%, which matches that, maybe that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of another way. The total amount paid is 12*31.50 = 378. The interest is 18. The principal is 360. \n\nIf simple interest, then rate is (Interest)/(Principal * time) = 18/(360*1) = 0.05 \u21925%. \n\nSo the answer should be D. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is expecting monthly rate? No, the options are annual rates. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using simple interest but the installments are considered as paying back the principal and interest each month. But in that case, the calculation would be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the concept of simple interest where the total interest is (P * R * T), but since the payments are monthly, the time for each part of the principal is different. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of it as each month's payment includes some interest and some principal. \n\nSuppose the interest is calculated on the remaining principal each month. \n\nBut that would be the case for compound interest. \n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the monthly rate using the annuity formula. Let me see if I can compute it numerically. \n\nThe equation is 360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nWe can try different r values to see which gives 360. \n\nLet me try r = 0.01 (1% monthly, so 12% annual). \n\nThen:\n\n1 - (1.01)^-12 /0.01. \n\n(1.01)^12 \u2248 1.1268. So reciprocal is ~0.8874. \n\n1 -0.8874 = 0.1126. \n\n0.1126 /0.01 = 11.26. \n\n31.50 *11.26 \u2248 31.5*11 +31.5*0.26 \u2248 346.5 +8.2 \u2248 354.7. Less than 360. \n\nHmm, so that's too low. \n\nWait, so if r is 1%, the present value is 354.7, which is less than 360. \n\nWait, so maybe a lower rate? Let's try 0.5% monthly (6% annual). \n\nr=0.005. \n\n(1.005)^12 \u22481.0617. \n\nReciprocal is ~0.9418. \n\n1-0.9418=0.0582. \n\n0.0582 /0.005 = 11.64. \n\n31.5*11.64 \u2248 366.66. \n\nWhich is higher than 360. \n\nHmm. So at 0.5%, the PV is 366.66, which is more than 360. \n\nWe need a rate between 0.5% and 1% monthly. \n\nLet me try 0.75% monthly (9% annual). \n\nr=0.0075 \n\n(1.0075)^12 \u2248 e^(0.0075*12)= e^0.09 \u22481.09417. \n\nReciprocal is ~0.914. \n\n1-0.914=0.086. \n\n0.086 /0.0075 = 11.4666. \n\n31.5 *11.4666 \u224831.5*11.4666. Let's compute 31.5*11 =346.5, 31.5*0.4666\u224814.7, total \u2248361.2. \n\nCloser to 360. \n\nSo with 0.75% monthly (9% annual), PV is ~361.2, which is close to 360. \n\nHmm, but the options don't have 9%. So that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, let me try 0.7% monthly (8.4% annual). \n\nr=0.007 \n\n(1.007)^12: Let's compute step by step. \n\n1.007^12. \n\nAlternatively, ln(1.007)= approx 0.006976. 12* that is 0.0837. e^0.0837 \u22481.0873. \n\nReciprocal is ~0.919. \n\n1-0.919=0.081. \n\n0.081 /0.007 = 11.5714. \n\n31.5*11.5714 \u2248 31.5*11=346.5, plus 31.5*0.5714\u224818. So total ~364.5. Still higher than 360. \n\nHmm. \n\nTrying 0.8% monthly (9.6%): \n\nr=0.008 \n\n(1.008)^12: \n\nln(1.008)= ~0.007968. 12 * that is ~0.0956. e^0.0956\u22481.10. \n\nReciprocal is 0.909. \n\n1-0.909=0.091. \n\n0.091/0.008=11.375. \n\n31.5 *11.375 = 31.5*(11 +0.375) = 31.5*11=346.5 + 31.5*0.375=11.8125 \u2192 total 358.3125. \n\nHmm, that's under 360. \n\nWait, so at 0.8% monthly (9.6% annual), PV is ~358.31. \n\nWe need to find r where PV is 360. \n\nBetween 0.75% (9% gives ~361.2) and 0.8% (9.6% gives ~358.3). \n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Since the options given don't have 9%, maybe the question expects the simple interest method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a simple interest where the total interest is 18. \n\nSo 18 /360 *100 =5% \u2192 answer D. \n\nThe options include D)5%, so that's probably the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the interest per month as (total interest)/12, so 18/12 =1.5 per month. Then annual rate would be 1.5*12=18% which isn't an option. Hmm, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using simple interest but the time is average? \n\nWait another thought: The total interest is 18. The average principal over the year would be (360 +0)/2 = 180. So the interest rate would be (18)/(180) =0.1 \u219210%? But that gives 10%, which is option C. \n\nHmm, that's conflicting with the previous thought. \n\nWait why would the average principal be considered here? \n\nIf the installments are paid equally, the principal is decreasing each month. So the average principal is indeed (360 +0)/2 = 180. \n\nThen, using simple interest formula: \n\nInterest = (Average Principal) * rate * time. \n\nSo 18 = 180 * R *1 \u2192 R = 18/(180) = 0.1 \u219210%. That would be option C. \n\nHmm, now I'm confused. \n\nSo which is correct? The problem is probably expecting which method? \n\nThe question is a bit ambiguous. In finance, installment loans typically use compound interest (amortization), but sometimes problems may simplify it as simple interest. \n\nAlternatively, in some cases, when the problem says \"interest rate\" without specifying, perhaps the simple interest is the expected approach. \n\nWait, let's see the total interest is 18. \n\nIf the question is using simple interest, then the rate is (18/360)*100=5%. \n\nBut if it's using the average principal, then it's 10%. \n\nHmm, so which is it? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting simple interest on the entire principal for the entire period. Which would be 5%. \n\nThe options have both 5% and 10%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where it's simple interest per month? \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nTotal interest is 18. \n\nThe time is 1 year, so 18/360 = 0.05 \u21925%. \n\nAlternatively, if the interest was simple but per month, then monthly rate would be (18/(360*12)) \u2192 but that would be 0.00375, which is 0.375% monthly, so annual 4.5%. \n\nWait, that gives 4.5% which is option B. \n\nWait, how? \n\nWait, if the interest is simple, and total interest is 18 = P * R * T. \n\nIf T is 1 year, then R=18/(360)=0.05 \u21925%. \n\nBut if the interest is computed monthly, so each month's interest is (360 * r/12), but since the payments are made each month, perhaps it's different. \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should see what the standard method is for such questions. \n\nIn many simple interest installment problems, especially when the question is from an exam, they might use the total interest divided by principal, giving the annual rate. So 18/360 is 5%. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be using the concept of simple interest where the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period, so 5% is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that each installment includes interest for the period. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. \n\nSuppose the man is paying 12 installments of 31.50. \n\nThe total amount paid is 378. \n\nThe extra 18 is the interest. \n\nIf we consider that the interest is simple, then the rate is 5%. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be using the formula for the rate in equal installments, which is: \n\nRate = (Total Interest * 100)/(Principal * number of months/2). \n\nWait, where did I get that formula? \n\nHmm, sometimes in simple interest installment plans, the total interest can be calculated as (P * R * n)/2, where n is the number of periods. \n\nWait, let me think. If you have a loan of P, and you pay it back in n equal installments, the total interest might be calculated as (P * R * n)/2. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nSuppose the principal is 360, and you pay back in 12 months. The average principal outstanding would be (360 +0)/2 =180. \n\nThen, total interest would be average principal * rate * time. \n\nSo, I = (P/2) * R * t. \n\nHere, time is 1 year, so I = (360/2)*R \u2192 180*R. \n\nGiven I=18, so R = 18/180=0.1 \u219210%. \n\nAh, so this would give 10% as the answer, which is option C. \n\nHmm, so now I'm confused between 5% and 10%. \n\nSo which approach is correct? \n\nThe problem is that different methods can give different results, so the question must specify which method to use. Since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps the question expects the simple interest approach where total interest is principal * rate * time, giving 5%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that each installment includes interest for the month. Let's see. \n\nSuppose the interest rate is monthly r. \n\nEach month, the man pays 31.50. \n\nThe loan is amortized over 12 months. \n\nThe formula for the monthly payment of an amortized loan is: \n\nPMT = P * [ r(1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n -1 ] \n\nWe can set PMT = 31.50, P=360, n=12. We need to find r. \n\nLet me try with the options. \n\nOption D is 5% annual \u2192 monthly rate 0.0041667 \n\nPlugging into the formula: \n\nNumerator: 0.0041667*(1.0041667)^12 \n\nDenominator: (1.0041667)^12 -1 \n\nFirst compute (1.0041667)^12. \n\nAs before, approximately e^(0.05) \u22481.05127. \n\nSo numerator: 0.0041667 * 1.05127 \u22480.00438. \n\nDenominator: 1.05127 -1 =0.05127 \n\nSo PMT =360*(0.00438/0.05127) \u2248 360*(0.0854) \u224830.75. \n\nBut the actual payment is 31.50. \n\nHmm, so that's lower than needed. \n\nIf we try option C, 10% annual \u2192 monthly 0.0083333 \n\nSo r=0.0083333 \n\nCompute (1.0083333)^12. \n\nLet me compute step by step. \n\n1.0083333^12: \n\nLet me approximate. \n\nEach month, multiply by 1.008333. \n\nAfter 12 months: \n\nLet me compute ln(1.008333) \u22480.00829. \n\n12* that is 0.0995. \n\ne^0.0995 \u22481.1046. \n\nSo numerator: 0.0083333 *1.1046 \u22480.009205. \n\nDenominator: 1.1046-1=0.1046 \n\nSo PMT=360*(0.009205/0.1046) \u2248360*(0.088) \u224831.68. \n\nWhich is very close to 31.50. \n\nHmm, so the monthly rate of ~0.8333% (10% annual) gives a payment of ~31.68, which is close to 31.50. \n\nThe given payment is 31.50, so perhaps the exact rate is a bit lower than 10%. \n\nBut since 10% gives almost the right value, and 10% is an option (C), but the options also have 5% (D). \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the simple interest method where total interest is 18, so 18/360=5%. \n\nBut the calculation with the amortization formula suggests that the correct rate is around 10%. \n\nHmm, but why is there such a discrepancy? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that uses the simple interest method for such problems. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the concept of flat rate vs. reducing balance. \n\nFlat rate is where the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period, so total interest is P*R*T. \n\nIn this case, the flat rate would be 5%. \n\nWhereas the reducing balance rate (amortized) would be higher. \n\nSince the question says \"interest rate\" without specifying, it might be expecting the flat rate, which is 5%. \n\nAlternatively, in some contexts, the flat rate is considered the interest rate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from an exam where the standard is to use simple interest, so the answer is D)5%. \n\nAlternatively, given that when I calculated with 10% annual rate using the amortization formula, the payment comes out to ~31.68, very close to 31.50, so maybe the question expects 10% as the answer. \n\nWait, but the options have 10% as C. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using simple interest, so the answer is D)5%. \n\nAlternatively, I need to check the difference between flat rate and reducing. \n\nFlat rate interest: \n\nTotal interest = (Principal * rate * time) \n\nIn this case, rate is flat. \n\nSo here, total interest is 18=360*R*1 \u2192 R=5%. \n\nThe reducing balance rate would be the one we calculated as ~10%, but that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be using flat rate, which is common in some installment loans. \n\nIn that case, the answer is D)5%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a source where the answer is 10%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have a trick. Let me think again. \n\nThe question says \"interest rate\"\u2014maybe it's the rate per month? \n\nWait, no, the options are all annual rates. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering simple interest per month. \n\nSo total interest is 18. \n\nTotal months is 12. \n\nSo per month interest is 1.5. \n\nThe principal is 360. \n\nSo monthly rate is (1.5)/360 =0.0041666, which is 0.4166% per month. \n\nAnnual rate would be 0.4166*12=5%. \n\nAh, so that's the same as the simple interest approach. \n\nSo that gives 5%. \n\nSo in that case, the answer is D. \n\nHmm, so that would be correct. \n\nThe key here is that the total interest is 18, so the per month interest is 1.5. \n\nSo if the principal is 360, then the monthly rate is (1.5)/360 \u21920.4166%. \n\nAnnual rate is 5%. \n\nYes, that's consistent. \n\nSo I think the answer is D)5%. \n\nThe confusion with the amortization method arises because that's a different way of calculating, but if the question doesn't specify, the simple interest method is likely the expected approach here. \n\nSo I'll go with D)5%.\n",

While compound interest methods might yield a different rate, the question likely expects the simple interest approach given the straightforward options and lack of context suggesting amortization.  \n\nAnswer: D",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about finding the interest rate when someone borrows money and pays it back in installments. Hmm, so the man borrows Rs. 360 and pays it back over 12 months with each installment being Rs.31.50. The options are given, so maybe I can figure this out by calculating the total amount paid and then the interest rate.\n\nFirst, I need to remember how interest rates work with installment payments. Wait, is this simple interest or compound interest? Since it's monthly installments, maybe it's simple interest? Or perhaps it's using an amortization method? Hmm, the question might be assuming simple interest, but I should think carefully.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total amount he pays back. Since there are 12 monthly payments of Rs.31.50 each, the total repayment is 12 multiplied by 31.50. Let me do that math: 12 * 30 is 360, but then 12 * 1.5 is 18, so total would be 360 + 18 = 378. So he pays back 378 in total. \n\nThe principal is 360, so the total interest paid is 378 - 360 = 18 rupees. Now, to find the interest rate, I need to see what percentage this interest is of the principal over the period. Since it's a year (12 months), the time is 1 year. \n\nIf it's simple interest, then the formula is I = P * R * T. Here, I is 18, P is 360, T is 1. So solving for R: R = I/(P*T) = 18/(360*1) = 0.05, which is 5%. Wait, but that would be option D. But let me think again\u2014maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the rate to be per annum but calculated differently. Because sometimes with installments, the interest might be calculated on reducing balance, which would be compound interest. But in that case, the calculation would be more complex. But since the problem gives simple options, perhaps it's expecting the simple interest approach.\n\nWait, let me check. Let's see: if the total interest is Rs.18, then 18 divided by 360 is 0.05, so 5%. That would be D. But let me check the options again. The options are A)1.5, B)4.5, C)10, D)5, E)12. So D is an option. Hmm, but maybe I need to confirm if the question is asking for the rate per annum, which it probably is. So that would be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering something else. Let me think again. Wait, maybe the problem is that the installments are paid monthly, so the interest is compounded monthly? Then the calculation would be different. Let me see.\n\nIf the interest is compounded monthly, the formula would be different. The total amount after 12 months would be P*(1 + r/12)^12, but in this case, he's paying monthly installments. That complicates things because each payment reduces the principal. So perhaps the simple interest approach isn't accurate here. \n\nHmm, maybe I should think of it as the total interest over the period. The total amount paid is 378. So the interest is 18. The principal is 360. So the rate would be (18/360)*100 = 5%, which is D. But why is option B (4.5%) there? Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the rate to be calculated as simple interest but considering the average principal. Because in installments, the principal decreases each month. The average amount owed would be (360 + 0)/2 = 180. Then total interest would be 18 = (360 * r * t)/2? Wait, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the formula for the total interest in an installment plan with equal payments can sometimes be calculated as the total payments minus principal divided by principal, then annualized. Let me see. \n\nTotal interest is 18, so (18/360)*100 = 5% per annum. That seems straightforward, so the answer should be D)5%. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is using a different method. Let me check another approach. Suppose the interest is calculated on a monthly basis. Let's see. Let me try to model the payments as an annuity. \n\nThe present value of the installments should equal the loan amount. So using the present value of an annuity formula: \n\nPV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]\n\nWhere PV is 360, PMT is 31.50, n is 12, and r is the monthly interest rate. \n\nWe can solve for r here, but since the options are annual rates, we would need to multiply the monthly rate by 12 to get the annual rate. \n\nHmm, this might be more accurate. Let me try plugging in the numbers. Let me see if I can find the monthly rate. \n\nLet me rearrange the formula to solve for r. \n\n360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nThis equation might be a bit tricky to solve algebraically, so perhaps trial and error with the options given. \n\nLet me check if 5% annual rate, so monthly rate would be 5%/12 \u2248 0.4167% per month. \n\nLet me compute the present value with r = 0.0041667 (5%/12):\n\nFirst, compute (1 + 0.0041667)^-12 \u2248 1/(1.0041667)^12. Let me approximate:\n\n1.0041667^12 is approximately e^(0.0041667*12) \u2248 e^0.05 \u2248 1.05127. So reciprocal is about 0.951. \n\nSo (1 - 0.951) = 0.049. Then 0.049 / 0.0041667 \u2248 11.76. Multiply by 31.50: 31.50 * 11.76 \u2248 31.5 * 12 = 378, minus some, like 31.5*(12-0.24)= 31.5*(11.76) = let's see 31.5 * 11 = 346.5, plus 31.5*0.76 \u2248 24. So total \u2248 346.5 +24= 370.5, but that's not 360. Hmm, so that suggests that the present value with 5% annual rate is higher than 360. Wait, maybe my approximation was off. \n\nAlternatively, let me try with 4.5% annual rate, so monthly rate 0.375% (4.5/12=0.375). \n\nr = 0.00375. \n\nCompute (1 + 0.00375)^-12. Let's compute (1.00375)^12. \n\nApproximate using logarithms: ln(1.00375) \u2248 0.00374. Multiply by 12 gives 0.0449. So exponent is e^0.0449 \u2248 1.046. So reciprocal is 1/1.046 \u2248 0.956. \n\nThen 1 - 0.956 = 0.044. Divide by 0.00375: 0.044 / 0.00375 \u2248 11.73. Multiply by 31.50: 31.5 * 11.73. Let's calculate 31.5*10=315, plus 31.5*1.73=54.405. Total 315 +54.405=369.405. Still higher than 360. Hmm. \n\nWait, the present value should be 360. Maybe I need a higher rate. Let's try 6% annual rate. Monthly 0.5%. \n\nr=0.005. \n\n(1.005)^12 \u2248 1.0617, so reciprocal is ~0.9418. \n\n1-0.9418=0.0582. \n\n0.0582 /0.005 = 11.64. \n\n31.5 *11.64 = 31.5*10=315 +31.5*1.64=51.66 \u2192 total 366.66. Still higher than 360. \n\nHmm. Wait, maybe I'm going the wrong way. Let me try 7% annual (monthly 0.5833%). \n\nr=0.0058333. \n\n(1.005833)^12 \u2248 1.0723. So reciprocal is ~0.932. \n\n1-0.932=0.068. \n\n0.068 /0.0058333 \u2248 11.66. \n\n31.5*11.66 \u2248 31.5*11 + 31.5*0.66=346.5 +20.8=367.3. Still over. \n\nHmm, maybe my approach is wrong here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is indeed expecting the simple interest method, so the answer is 5%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the total interest is 18, so 18/360 is 5%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated as simple interest over the year, so that's the correct approach. Since the options include 5%, which matches that, maybe that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of another way. The total amount paid is 12*31.50 = 378. The interest is 18. The principal is 360. \n\nIf simple interest, then rate is (Interest)/(Principal * time) = 18/(360*1) = 0.05 \u21925%. \n\nSo the answer should be D. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is expecting monthly rate? No, the options are annual rates. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using simple interest but the installments are considered as paying back the principal and interest each month. But in that case, the calculation would be different. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the concept of simple interest where the total interest is (P * R * T), but since the payments are monthly, the time for each part of the principal is different. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of it as each month's payment includes some interest and some principal. \n\nSuppose the interest is calculated on the remaining principal each month. \n\nBut that would be the case for compound interest. \n\nAlternatively, let me try to compute the monthly rate using the annuity formula. Let me see if I can compute it numerically. \n\nThe equation is 360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nWe can try different r values to see which gives 360. \n\nLet me try r = 0.01 (1% monthly, so 12% annual). \n\nThen:\n\n1 - (1.01)^-12 /0.01. \n\n(1.01)^12 \u2248 1.1268. So reciprocal is ~0.8874. \n\n1 -0.8874 = 0.1126. \n\n0.1126 /0.01 = 11.26. \n\n31.50 *11.26 \u2248 31.5*11 +31.5*0.26 \u2248 346.5 +8.2 \u2248 354.7. Less than 360. \n\nHmm, so that's too low. \n\nWait, so if r is 1%, the present value is 354.7, which is less than 360. \n\nWait, so maybe a lower rate? Let's try 0.5% monthly (6% annual). \n\nr=0.005. \n\n(1.005)^12 \u22481.0617. \n\nReciprocal is ~0.9418. \n\n1-0.9418=0.0582. \n\n0.0582 /0.005 = 11.64. \n\n31.5*11.64 \u2248 366.66. \n\nWhich is higher than 360. \n\nHmm. So at 0.5%, the PV is 366.66, which is more than 360. \n\nWe need a rate between 0.5% and 1% monthly. \n\nLet me try 0.75% monthly (9% annual). \n\nr=0.0075 \n\n(1.0075)^12 \u2248 e^(0.0075*12)= e^0.09 \u22481.09417. \n\nReciprocal is ~0.914. \n\n1-0.914=0.086. \n\n0.086 /0.0075 = 11.4666. \n\n31.5 *11.4666 \u224831.5*11.4666. Let's compute 31.5*11 =346.5, 31.5*0.4666\u224814.7, total \u2248361.2. \n\nCloser to 360. \n\nSo with 0.75% monthly (9% annual), PV is ~361.2, which is close to 360. \n\nHmm, but the options don't have 9%. So that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, let me try 0.7% monthly (8.4% annual). \n\nr=0.007 \n\n(1.007)^12: Let's compute step by step. \n\n1.007^12. \n\nAlternatively, ln(1.007)= approx 0.006976. 12* that is 0.0837. e^0.0837 \u22481.0873. \n\nReciprocal is ~0.919. \n\n1-0.919=0.081. \n\n0.081 /0.007 = 11.5714. \n\n31.5*11.5714 \u2248 31.5*11=346.5, plus 31.5*0.5714\u224818. So total ~364.5. Still higher than 360. \n\nHmm. \n\nTrying 0.8% monthly (9.6%): \n\nr=0.008 \n\n(1.008)^12: \n\nln(1.008)= ~0.007968. 12 * that is ~0.0956. e^0.0956\u22481.10. \n\nReciprocal is 0.909. \n\n1-0.909=0.091. \n\n0.091/0.008=11.375. \n\n31.5 *11.375 = 31.5*(11 +0.375) = 31.5*11=346.5 + 31.5*0.375=11.8125 \u2192 total 358.3125. \n\nHmm, that's under 360. \n\nWait, so at 0.8% monthly (9.6% annual), PV is ~358.31. \n\nWe need to find r where PV is 360. \n\nBetween 0.75% (9% gives ~361.2) and 0.8% (9.6% gives ~358.3). \n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is too time-consuming. Since the options given don't have 9%, maybe the question expects the simple interest method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a simple interest where the total interest is 18. \n\nSo 18 /360 *100 =5% \u2192 answer D. \n\nThe options include D)5%, so that's probably the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the interest per month as (total interest)/12, so 18/12 =1.5 per month. Then annual rate would be 1.5*12=18% which isn't an option. Hmm, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using simple interest but the time is average? \n\nWait another thought: The total interest is 18. The average principal over the year would be (360 +0)/2 = 180. So the interest rate would be (18)/(180) =0.1 \u219210%? But that gives 10%, which is option C. \n\nHmm, that's conflicting with the previous thought. \n\nWait why would the average principal be considered here? \n\nIf the installments are paid equally, the principal is decreasing each month. So the average principal is indeed (360 +0)/2 = 180. \n\nThen, using simple interest formula: \n\nInterest = (Average Principal) * rate * time. \n\nSo 18 = 180 * R *1 \u2192 R = 18/(180) = 0.1 \u219210%. That would be option C. \n\nHmm, now I'm confused. \n\nSo which is correct? The problem is probably expecting which method? \n\nThe question is a bit ambiguous. In finance, installment loans typically use compound interest (amortization), but sometimes problems may simplify it as simple interest. \n\nAlternatively, in some cases, when the problem says \"interest rate\" without specifying, perhaps the simple interest is the expected approach. \n\nWait, let's see the total interest is 18. \n\nIf the question is using simple interest, then the rate is (18/360)*100=5%. \n\nBut if it's using the average principal, then it's 10%. \n\nHmm, so which is it? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting simple interest on the entire principal for the entire period. Which would be 5%. \n\nThe options have both 5% and 10%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where it's simple interest per month? \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nTotal interest is 18. \n\nThe time is 1 year, so 18/360 = 0.05 \u21925%. \n\nAlternatively, if the interest was simple but per month, then monthly rate would be (18/(360*12)) \u2192 but that would be 0.00375, which is 0.375% monthly, so annual 4.5%. \n\nWait, that gives 4.5% which is option B. \n\nWait, how? \n\nWait, if the interest is simple, and total interest is 18 = P * R * T. \n\nIf T is 1 year, then R=18/(360)=0.05 \u21925%. \n\nBut if the interest is computed monthly, so each month's interest is (360 * r/12), but since the payments are made each month, perhaps it's different. \n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should see what the standard method is for such questions. \n\nIn many simple interest installment problems, especially when the question is from an exam, they might use the total interest divided by principal, giving the annual rate. So 18/360 is 5%. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be using the concept of simple interest where the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period, so 5% is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that each installment includes interest for the period. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. \n\nSuppose the man is paying 12 installments of 31.50. \n\nThe total amount paid is 378. \n\nThe extra 18 is the interest. \n\nIf we consider that the interest is simple, then the rate is 5%. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be using the formula for the rate in equal installments, which is: \n\nRate = (Total Interest * 100)/(Principal * number of months/2). \n\nWait, where did I get that formula? \n\nHmm, sometimes in simple interest installment plans, the total interest can be calculated as (P * R * n)/2, where n is the number of periods. \n\nWait, let me think. If you have a loan of P, and you pay it back in n equal installments, the total interest might be calculated as (P * R * n)/2. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nSuppose the principal is 360, and you pay back in 12 months. The average principal outstanding would be (360 +0)/2 =180. \n\nThen, total interest would be average principal * rate * time. \n\nSo, I = (P/2) * R * t. \n\nHere, time is 1 year, so I = (360/2)*R \u2192 180*R. \n\nGiven I=18, so R = 18/180=0.1 \u219210%. \n\nAh, so this would give 10% as the answer, which is option C. \n\nHmm, so now I'm confused between 5% and 10%. \n\nSo which approach is correct? \n\nThe problem is that different methods can give different results, so the question must specify which method to use. Since it's a multiple-choice question, perhaps the question expects the simple interest approach where total interest is principal * rate * time, giving 5%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that each installment includes interest for the month. Let's see. \n\nSuppose the interest rate is monthly r. \n\nEach month, the man pays 31.50. \n\nThe loan is amortized over 12 months. \n\nThe formula for the monthly payment of an amortized loan is: \n\nPMT = P * [ r(1 + r)^n ] / [ (1 + r)^n -1 ] \n\nWe can set PMT = 31.50, P=360, n=12. We need to find r. \n\nLet me try with the options. \n\nOption D is 5% annual \u2192 monthly rate 0.0041667 \n\nPlugging into the formula: \n\nNumerator: 0.0041667*(1.0041667)^12 \n\nDenominator: (1.0041667)^12 -1 \n\nFirst compute (1.0041667)^12. \n\nAs before, approximately e^(0.05) \u22481.05127. \n\nSo numerator: 0.0041667 * 1.05127 \u22480.00438. \n\nDenominator: 1.05127 -1 =0.05127 \n\nSo PMT =360*(0.00438/0.05127) \u2248 360*(0.0854) \u224830.75. \n\nBut the actual payment is 31.50. \n\nHmm, so that's lower than needed. \n\nIf we try option C, 10% annual \u2192 monthly 0.0083333 \n\nSo r=0.0083333 \n\nCompute (1.0083333)^12. \n\nLet me compute step by step. \n\n1.0083333^12: \n\nLet me approximate. \n\nEach month, multiply by 1.008333. \n\nAfter 12 months: \n\nLet me compute ln(1.008333) \u22480.00829. \n\n12* that is 0.0995. \n\ne^0.0995 \u22481.1046. \n\nSo numerator: 0.0083333 *1.1046 \u22480.009205. \n\nDenominator: 1.1046-1=0.1046 \n\nSo PMT=360*(0.009205/0.1046) \u2248360*(0.088) \u224831.68. \n\nWhich is very close to 31.50. \n\nHmm, so the monthly rate of ~0.8333% (10% annual) gives a payment of ~31.68, which is close to 31.50. \n\nThe given payment is 31.50, so perhaps the exact rate is a bit lower than 10%. \n\nBut since 10% gives almost the right value, and 10% is an option (C), but the options also have 5% (D). \n\nHmm, this is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the simple interest method where total interest is 18, so 18/360=5%. \n\nBut the calculation with the amortization formula suggests that the correct rate is around 10%. \n\nHmm, but why is there such a discrepancy? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a source that uses the simple interest method for such problems. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the concept of flat rate vs. reducing balance. \n\nFlat rate is where the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period, so total interest is P*R*T. \n\nIn this case, the flat rate would be 5%. \n\nWhereas the reducing balance rate (amortized) would be higher. \n\nSince the question says \"interest rate\" without specifying, it might be expecting the flat rate, which is 5%. \n\nAlternatively, in some contexts, the flat rate is considered the interest rate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from an exam where the standard is to use simple interest, so the answer is D)5%. \n\nAlternatively, given that when I calculated with 10% annual rate using the amortization formula, the payment comes out to ~31.68, very close to 31.50, so maybe the question expects 10% as the answer. \n\nWait, but the options have 10% as C. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using simple interest, so the answer is D)5%. \n\nAlternatively, I need to check the difference between flat rate and reducing. \n\nFlat rate interest: \n\nTotal interest = (Principal * rate * time) \n\nIn this case, rate is flat. \n\nSo here, total interest is 18=360*R*1 \u2192 R=5%. \n\nThe reducing balance rate would be the one we calculated as ~10%, but that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, the question might be using flat rate, which is common in some installment loans. \n\nIn that case, the answer is D)5%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from a source where the answer is 10%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have a trick. Let me think again. \n\nThe question says \"interest rate\"\u2014maybe it's the rate per month? \n\nWait, no, the options are all annual rates. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering simple interest per month. \n\nSo total interest is 18. \n\nTotal months is 12. \n\nSo per month interest is 1.5. \n\nThe principal is 360. \n\nSo monthly rate is (1.5)/360 =0.0041666, which is 0.4166% per month. \n\nAnnual rate would be 0.4166*12=5%. \n\nAh, so that's the same as the simple interest approach. \n\nSo that gives 5%. \n\nSo in that case, the answer is D. \n\nHmm, so that would be correct. \n\nThe key here is that the total interest is 18, so the per month interest is 1.5. \n\nSo if the principal is 360, then the monthly rate is (1.5)/360 \u21920.4166%. \n\nAnnual rate is 5%. \n\nYes, that's consistent. \n\nSo I think the answer is D)5%. \n\nThe confusion with the amortization method arises because that's a different way of calculating, but if the question doesn't specify, the simple interest method is likely the expected approach here. \n\nSo I'll go with D)5%.\n\n\nThe man borrows Rs. 360 and repays it in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. To determine the interest rate:\n\n1. **Total Repayment**:  \n   Total amount paid = 12 \u00d7 31.50 = Rs. 378.  \n\n2. **Total Interest Paid**:  \n   Interest = Total repayment \u2212 Principal = 378 \u2212 360 = Rs. 18.  \n\n3. **Simple Interest Calculation**:  \n   Using the simple interest formula \\( I = P \\times R \\times T \\):  \n   \\( 18 = 360 \\times R \\times 1 \\).  \n   Solving for \\( R \\):  \n   \\( R = \\frac{18}{360} = 0.05 \\), or **5%**.  \n\nThis matches option D. The calculation assumes simple interest, where the interest is computed on the original principal for the entire period. While compound interest methods might yield a different rate, the question likely expects the simple interest approach given the straightforward options and lack of context suggesting amortization.  \n\nAnswer: D",
