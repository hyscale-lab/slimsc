      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a shopkeeper selling a watch with a discount. The question is asking for the marked price of the watch. Hmm. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount. If he gives a 7% discount instead, his profit is Rs. 15 less. We need to find the marked price. \n\nAlright, let's break this down. Let me recall some basic concepts. The marked price is the original price before any discounts. When a discount is given, the selling price becomes marked price minus the discount percentage. The profit would then depend on the cost price. But here, the problem is comparing two different discounts and the difference in profit.\n\nLet me denote the marked price as MP. Let's let MP be the variable we need to find. \n\nWhen the discount is 5%, the selling price (SP1) would be MP * (1 - 5/100) = 0.95 * MP. \n\nIf the discount is 7%, then the selling price (SP2) would be MP * (1 -7/100) = 0.93 * MP.\n\nThe profit in each case would be the selling price minus the cost price (CP). The difference between the two profits is Rs.15. \n\nSo, Profit1 = SP1 - CP\nProfit2 = SP2 - CP\nThe difference between Profit1 and Profit2 is 15. Since when discount increases, profit decreases, so Profit1 - Profit2 = 15.\n\nSo, (SP1 - CP) - (SP2 - CP) = 15 \u2192 SP1 - SP2 =15.\n\nBecause the CP cancels out. That's clever. So the difference between the two selling prices is 15 rupees. \n\nSo, SP1 - SP2 = 0.95MP - 0.93MP = 0.02MP = 15. \n\nAh! So 0.02 times the marked price equals 15. Then, solving for MP: MP = 15 / 0.02 = 750. Wait, but let me check the options. Option D is 750. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check.\n\nWait, let me re-verify the steps. \n\nThe difference between the two selling prices is 2% of the marked price, because 5% discount gives SP of 95% of MP, and 7% gives 93%, so the difference is 2%. That 2% corresponds to the Rs.15 loss in profit. \n\nYes. So 2% of MP = 15 \u2192 MP = 15 / 0.02 = 750. So the answer would be D) 750? \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)697.50, B)712.50, C)787.50, D)750, E)780. So D is there. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the reasoning. Let me think again.\n\nWait another way: the problem says that when the discount increases by 2%, the profit decreases by 15. Since profit is selling price minus cost, the difference in selling price is exactly the difference in profit. Because the cost price remains the same. So yes, the difference between SP1 and SP2 is 15. So 0.02MP =15 \u2192 MP=750. So D is correct. \n\nHmm, but let me see if another approach would give a different answer. Let me suppose that the cost price is involved somehow else. Wait, no, because when you take the difference between the two profits, the cost price cancels out. So the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should set up equations. Let me try that. Let MP be the marked price, and CP be the cost price.\n\nFirst scenario: discount 5%, so SP1 = 0.95 MP. Profit1 = SP1 - CP.\n\nSecond scenario: discount 7%, SP2 = 0.93 MP. Profit2 = SP2 - CP.\n\nThe problem states that Profit1 - Profit2 = 15. \n\nSo substituting:\n\n(0.95MP - CP) - (0.93MP - CP) =15 \n\nSimplify this: 0.95MP - CP -0.93MP + CP =15 \n\nThe CP terms cancel out, so 0.02 MP =15 \u2192 MP=15/0.02=750. \n\nYes, that's exactly the same result. So the answer must be D. \n\nLooking at the options, D is Rs.750, so that's the correct choice. \n\nWait, but why is there an option C as 787.50? Did I miscalculate? Let me check again. \n\nWait 15 divided by 0.02: 0.02 \u00d7 750 = 15. 0.02 \u00d7 750 is indeed 15. Because 1% of 750 is 7.5, so 2% is 15. So yes. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is D. The options are given correctly. So I think the correct answer is D.\n",

Hmm, I need to find the marked price. \n\nAlright, the problem says that when the discount is 5%, the profit is a certain amount, but if the discount increases to 7%, the profit is Rs.15 less. The key here is probably to relate the discount percentages to the change in profit. \n\nLet me think. The marked price is the original price before any discount. Let's denote the marked price as M. \n\nWhen the discount is 5%, the selling price becomes 95% of M, right? Because 100% -5% discount =95% of M. So SP1 = 0.95*M.\n\nIf the discount is 7%, then the selling price would be 93% of M. SP2 = 0.93*M.\n\nThe difference between these two selling prices is the extra amount the shopkeeper loses (or the customer pays less), which is 0.95M -0.93M =0.02M. Wait, but how does this relate to the profit difference?\n\nOh right, the profit is calculated as Selling Price minus Cost Price. Let's assume the cost price is C. Then, the profit when discount is 5% is (0.95M - C). When the discount is 7%, the profit becomes (0.93M - C). The problem states that the second profit is 15 less than the first. So:\n\n(0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15.\n\nWait, because the profit decreases by 15 when the discount increases. Let me check that equation again. The difference between the two profits is 15. So:\n\nProfit1 - Profit2 =15.\n\nWhich is (0.95M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15. \n\nSimplifying that, the C terms cancel out. So 0.95M -0.93M =15. That gives 0.02M =15. \n\nSo solving for M would be 15 divided by 0.02. Let me calculate that. 15 divided by 0.02 is the same as 15 * 50, because 1/0.02 is 50. So 15 *50 =750. Wait, so the marked price would be 750? Let me check the options. Option D is 750. But wait, hold on a second. \n\nWait, let me confirm. The problem says when the discount is 7%, the profit is 15 less. So the difference between the two selling prices is indeed 0.02M, which equals 15. Therefore M =15 /0.02 =750. So the answer should be D?\n\nHmm, but let me think again. Because sometimes there might be a trick. Let me see. The cost price cancels out, so the difference in profit is exactly the difference in selling prices. That's correct because Profit = SP - CP, so subtracting the two profits gives (SP1 - CP) - (SP2 - CP) = SP1 - SP2 = difference in profits. So that's correct. Therefore, the calculation is right, so the marked price is 750. Looking at the options, D is Rs.750, so that should be the answer. \n\nWait but let me check the options again.
