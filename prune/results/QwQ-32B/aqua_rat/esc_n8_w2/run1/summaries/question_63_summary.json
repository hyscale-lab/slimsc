      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the maximum distance I can travel with $8.50 in this cab. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile, and then 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile. Hmm, right. So first, I should break down the costs step by step.\n\nThe first part is the initial quarter-mile. That's 0.25 miles, costing $3.50. Then, after that, every additional quarter mile is 10 cents. So I need to subtract the initial cost from the total money to see how much is left for the additional miles.\n\nLet me start by subtracting the initial fee. The total money is $8.50. So 8.50 minus 3.50 equals... that's $5.00 left. \n\nNow, with the remaining $5.00, each quarter mile costs $0.10. So how many quarter-miles can I get with $5? Let's divide 5.00 by 0.10. That would be 500 cents divided by 10 cents, which is 50. So 50 quarter-miles. \n\nEach quarter-mile is 0.25 miles. So the additional distance is 50 times 0.25. Let me calculate that. 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. \n\nWait, but then I have to add the initial quarter-mile. The first part was 0.25 miles. So total distance is 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles. Hmm, so that would be option B?\n\nWait a second, let me check my math again. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with $8.50. Subtract the initial $3.50. 8.50 -3.50 is indeed 5.00. The remaining $5 is for the additional quarter-miles. Each of those is 10 cents. So how many 10 cents are in 5 dollars? Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, 5 dollars is 500 cents. 500 divided by 10 is 50. So 50 quarter-miles. Each quarter mile is 0.25, so 50 *0.25 is 12.5 miles. Adding the initial 0.25 gives 12.75 total. That matches option B. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. The problem says \"each additional quarter mile\". So the first quarter mile is included in the initial charge. So after that, every quarter mile beyond that first one is 10 cents. So yes, the calculation seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if the question counts the first quarter mile as part of the initial charge, so that the additional charges start after that. So the total distance is first 0.25 plus (number of additional quarter miles)*0.25. \n\nHmm, so the steps are correct. So the answer should be B, 12.75 miles. Let me check the options again. Option B is 12.75, so that's the one. \n\nI think that's it. I don't see any mistakes here. The key is to subtract the initial cost, then see how many 0.10 increments fit into the remaining money, convert that into miles, then add the first part. Yep, that's right.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the question is about calculating the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 in a cab that has a specific fare structure. The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile. I need to figure out how far that money can get me. \n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The initial charge is $3.50 for the first quarter-mile. After that, each additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents. So the first part is a fixed cost, and then the rest is variable. \n\nAlright, so the total money I have is $8.50. Let me subtract the initial fee first. The remaining money after the first quarter-mile would be $8.50 minus $3.50. Let me calculate that: 8.50 - 3.50 = 5.00. So I have $5 left for the additional quarter-miles. \n\nEach additional quarter-mile is 10 cents. Wait, but 10 cents per quarter-mile? That seems really cheap. Maybe I should confirm the units. The problem says 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. So each quarter mile after the first costs $0.10. \n\nSo, with the remaining $5, how many quarter-miles can I get? Let's divide the remaining money by the cost per quarter-mile. That would be $5.00 divided by $0.10 per quarter-mile. \n\nCalculating that: 5 / 0.10 = 50. So that's 50 additional quarter-miles. \n\nNow, the first quarter-mile plus these 50 quarter-miles. Let's convert all to miles. Each quarter-mile is 0.25 miles. \n\nFirst segment: 0.25 miles. \n\nAdditional segments: 50 * 0.25 miles. Let's compute that. 50 * 0.25 is 12.5 miles. \n\nAdding them together: 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles total. \n\nWait, so that would be 12.75 miles. Let me check the options. Option B is 12.75. Hmm. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe the question is in terms of distance units. Let me recheck the math. \n\nTotal money: $8.50. Subtract the initial $3.50, which leaves $5.00. Each additional quarter-mile is $0.10. So $5.00 / $0.10 per quarter-mile is indeed 50 quarter-miles. \n\n50 quarter-miles is 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. Adding the first 0.25 gives 12.75. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be B. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here. \n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me read again. The first quarter-mile is $3.50, then each additional quarter-mile is 10 cents. So the first quarter is the first 0.25 miles, then each 0.25 after that. So yes, the calculation seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they mean each additional 1/4 mile beyond the first is 10 cents. So the total distance is first 0.25 plus (number of additional quarters)*0.25. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider whether the 10 cents is per quarter mile or per some other interval. The problem says 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. So each quarter mile after the first is 10 cents. \n\nSo, yes, the calculation is correct. The total distance would be 12.75 miles, so option B. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let me structure it step by step. \n\nTotal cost = initial fee + (number of additional quarter miles * rate). \n\nThe total cost can't exceed $8.50. \n\nLet me model it as an equation. Let D be the total distance in miles. The first 0.25 miles cost $3.50. Any distance beyond that is charged per 0.25 mile increments. \n\nSo, the distance beyond the first 0.25 is D - 0.25 miles. Each 0.25 mile segment in this excess costs $0.10. \n\nThe number of additional quarter-miles would be (D - 0.25)/0.25. Since each quarter mile is 0.25 miles. \n\nTherefore, the total cost is 3.50 + 0.10 * [(D -0.25)/0.25] \n\nWe need this total cost to be \u2264 8.50. \n\nLet me set up the equation: \n\n3.50 + 0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25] \u2264 8.50 \n\nLet me solve for D. \n\nFirst, subtract 3.50: 0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25] \u2264 5.00 \n\nDivide both sides by 0.10: (D -0.25)/0.25 \u2264 50 \n\nMultiply both sides by 0.25: D -0.25 \u2264 12.5 \n\nAdd 0.25: D \u2264 12.75 \n\nSo the maximum D is 12.75, which matches my previous calculation. \n\nSo the answer is B. \n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I need to consider that the additional charges are per quarter mile, so perhaps the number of quarter-miles must be an integer? Like, can you have a fraction of a quarter mile? \n\nThe problem says \"each additional quarter mile\", so maybe each quarter is a unit. So perhaps the distance must be in multiples of 0.25. \n\nWait, but in the calculation above, when I solved the equation, I ended up with exactly 12.75, which is a multiple of 0.25. So that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects that if you have a little bit left, you can go a bit more? But since the fare is charged per quarter mile, you can't pay a fraction of the 10 cents. \n\nWait, let me think again. The total money after the initial is $5.00. Each quarter mile is 10 cents. 5.00 / 0.10 is exactly 50. So there's no leftover money. So 50 quarters after the first. So exactly 12.75 miles. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B)12.75 miles. \n\nThe options given are A through E, and B is 12.75. So that's correct. \n\nI don't see any mistakes here. The other options: 14.75 would be higher. Let me see why someone might think that. Maybe if they miscalculated the division? Like, perhaps 8.50 minus 3.50 is 5, but then 5 divided by 0.10 is 50, but then 50 times 0.25 is 12.5 plus 0.25 is 12.75. So yeah. So I think B is correct.\n",
