      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this age problem. Hmm, so the question is about Sachin and Ajay's ages. Let me read it again carefully. \n\nThe problem says: \"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years?\" The options are A to E.\n\nAlright, first, I need to translate the words into equations. Let me assign variables. Let me denote Sachin's current age as S and Ajay's current age as A. That makes sense. \n\nThe first part says, \"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back.\" Ten years back would be their ages subtracted by 10. So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age was S - 10 and Ajay's was A - 10. The statement says Sachin was twice as old then. So the equation would be: \n\nS - 10 = 2*(A - 10). \n\nGot that. \n\nNow the second part: \"Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.\" So, in 10 years, Sachin's age will be S + 10 = 40. Wait, solving that would give S's current age. Let me do that first. \n\nIf S + 10 = 40, then S = 40 - 10 = 30. So Sachin is currently 30 years old. \n\nNow plug that into the first equation. So S is 30, so substituting into S -10 = 2*(A -10):\n\n30 -10 = 2*(A -10)\n20 = 2*(A -10)\nDivide both sides by 2: 10 = A -10\nThen add 10 to both sides: A = 20. \n\nWait, so Ajay is 20 today? Let me check the options. Option D is 20. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify. \n\nSo if Ajay is 20 now, then 10 years ago he was 10. Sachin is 30 now, so 10 years ago he was 20. Which is indeed twice 10. That checks out. And in 10 years, Sachin would be 40. Yep, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be D)20. Let me check the options again. The options are A)18, B)25, C)15, D)20, E)21. So D is there. \n\nWait, did I misread the problem? Let me read once more. \n\nThe first part is 10 years back, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So yes, 20 vs 10. That's correct. And the second part, Sachin's age in 10 years is 40, so current 30. All the steps add up. \n\nI think that's right. So the answer is D.\n",

Now, we have to find Ajay's current age given that Sachin will be 40 in 10 years. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me note down the information given. Let me assign variables. Let's say Ajay's current age is A years, and Sachin's current age is S years. \n\nThe problem mentions two time points: 10 years back and 10 years in the future. Let's parse each part.\n\n10 years back, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age would be S - 10, and Ajay's age would be A - 10. At that time, Sachin's age was twice Ajay's. So the equation would be: \n\nS - 10 = 2*(A - 10)\n\nThen the other part of the problem says that Sachin will be 40 in 10 years. That means in 10 years, Sachin's age will be S + 10 = 40. So from that, I can find Sachin's current age. Let me solve that first.\n\nS + 10 = 40 \u2192 S = 40 - 10 \u2192 S = 30. So Sachin is currently 30 years old.\n\nNow plug that back into the first equation.

Hmm, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes it's easy to mix up the time frames.\n\nWait, so 10 years back, Sachin was 30 -10 =20, and Ajay was 20-10=10. Then indeed, 20 is twice 10.

Let me check again.\n\nOriginal statement: \"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back.\" So 10 years ago, Sachin's age was twice Ajay's age at that time. So equation S-10 = 2*(A -10). Correct. Then solving with S=30, so 20 = 2*(A-10). Yes. So A-10 is 10, so A=20. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. So why is the option D 20. So the answer must be D. I think that's right.\n",
