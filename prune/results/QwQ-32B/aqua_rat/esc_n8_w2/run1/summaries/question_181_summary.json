      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is about a bee that bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by because those flowers don't have nectar. The question is asking how many flowers the bee needs to fly by in order to bypass 8 flowers. The options are given from A to E. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked here. The bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it encounters. So, if the bee flies by, say, X flowers, then 0.05% of X would be the number of flowers it bypasses. The problem states that the bee wants to bypass 8 flowers. So, essentially, we need to find X such that 0.05% of X equals 8.\n\nLet me write that down as an equation. Let X be the total number of flowers the bee flies by. Then:\n\n0.05% of X = 8\n\nBut percentages can be tricky. Remember that a percentage is per hundred. So 0.05% is the same as 0.05 per 100, or 0.0005 in decimal form. Because 1% is 0.01, so 0.05% would be 0.05 divided by 100, right?\n\nSo converting 0.05% to decimal: 0.05 / 100 = 0.0005.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n0.0005 * X = 8\n\nTo solve for X, I can divide both sides by 0.0005.\n\nX = 8 / 0.0005\n\nHmm, let me compute that. 8 divided by 0.0005. Well, 0.0005 is the same as 5/10,000. So dividing by 5/10,000 is the same as multiplying by 10,000/5.\n\nSo 8 * (10,000 /5) = 8 * 2000 = 16,000. Wait, that would be 16,000?\n\nBut let me check again. Alternatively, 0.0005 times X equals 8. Let me compute 8 divided by 0.0005. Let's see:\n\nDividing by a decimal: moving the decimal places. 0.0005 is 5 x 10^-4. So 8 divided by (5 x10^-4) is (8/5) x 10^4. 8 divided by 5 is 1.6, so 1.6 x 10^4 is 16,000. Yeah, that matches.\n\nSo the calculation gives me X = 16,000. Looking at the options, D is 16000. So the answer should be D?\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't misinterpret the question. The problem says \"the bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them.\" So the 0.05% is the percentage of flowers it flies by that it actually bypasses. Wait, no, maybe I need to clarify: does the 0.05% refer to the flowers it flies by, or the total flowers available? The wording is important here.\n\nThe question says \"bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by\". So the key part is \"flies by\" \u2014 so the bee flies by some number of flowers, and of those, 0.05% are bypassed. Wait, but that might not make sense. Wait, perhaps \"bypasses\" here means that when the bee is flying by, it checks and decides to bypass those without nectar. So the 0.05% is the proportion of flowers it encounters (flies by) that it decides to bypass. So the equation is correct as before.\n\nSo if the bee flies by X flowers, then 0.05% of X is the number it bypasses. So if that number is 8, then X is 16,000. So D is the answer. Let me check the options again. The options are A)2000, B)4000, C)8000, D)16000, E)32000. So D is there. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a misunderstanding here? Let me read the question again carefully.\n\n\"A bee bypasses 0.05% of flowers it flies by because it can sense they don't have any nectar in them. How many flowers will the bee fly by to bypass 8 flowers?\"\n\nSo the phrasing \"flies by\" might mean that the bee is flying past the flowers, and of those, 0.05% are bypassed. Wait, but if it's flying by them, then the ones it bypasses would be the ones it doesn't land on? Or is \"bypass\" meaning that it avoids them entirely?\n\nHmm, perhaps \"flies by\" is the total number of flowers the bee comes across, and of those, 0.05% are bypassed (i.e., not visited). So the question is, to have 8 bypassed flowers, how many total does it have to fly by? So the calculation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased such that the bee is trying to bypass 8 flowers, so how many does it have to fly by? That's exactly the same as the equation. So the answer is D, 16,000.\n\nAlternatively, could the percentage be of the total flowers, but perhaps the question is worded differently? Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the percentage conversion. Let me confirm:\n\n0.05% as a decimal is 0.0005. So 0.05 divided by 100 is 0.0005. So yes, that's correct.\n\nSo 0.0005 * X = 8 \u2192 X = 8 / 0.0005. 8 divided by 0.0005. Let me compute this step by step.\n\n0.0005 is a half of a thousandth. So 1 divided by 0.0005 is 2000. So 8 divided by 0.0005 is 8*2000=16,000. So yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D, 16000.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that a bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by.
