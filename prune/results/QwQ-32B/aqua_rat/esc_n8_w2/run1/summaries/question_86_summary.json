      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about a three-digit number M = abc and its reverse N = cba. We know that M is greater than N, and when we subtract N from M and add 396 times c, the result is 990. We need to find how many such M values are there that are more than 300.\n\nHmm, first, let me write down what's given. Let me think of M as the number 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, N would be 100c + 10b + a. The condition M > N means that the original number is bigger than its reverse. \n\nThe equation given is M - N + 396c = 990. Let's substitute the expressions for M and N here. \n\nSo M - N would be (100a +10b +c) - (100c +10b +a) = 100a +10b +c -100c -10b -a. Let's compute that term by term. \n\n100a - a is 99a, 10b -10b cancels out, and c -100c is -99c. So overall, M - N = 99a -99c. \n\nSo substituting into the equation given: (99a -99c) + 396c = 990. Let me simplify that. \n\nCombine the terms with c: -99c +396c = 297c. So the equation becomes 99a + 297c = 990. \n\nHmm, maybe factor out 99? Let's see: 99(a + 3c) = 990. Dividing both sides by 99 gives a + 3c = 10. \n\nWait, that's a key equation here: a + 3c = 10. \n\nNow, since a and c are digits (since they are the hundreds and units digits of a three-digit number), their possible values are from 0 to 9. But since M is a three-digit number, a can't be 0. Similarly, c can be 0, but since N is also a three-digit number (because it's the reverse of M, which is three digits), then c can't be 0 either, right? Because if c were 0, then N would be a two-digit number. Wait, the problem doesn't specify that N is a three-digit number. Wait, the problem just says N = cba. So if c is 0, then N would be 0ba, which would effectively be a two-digit number. But the problem states that M is a three-digit number. But maybe N can be a two-digit number? Hmm, the question might not require N to be three digits, so maybe c can be 0. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but the problem says M is a three-digit number, so a can't be 0. But c can be 0. So, in the equation a + 3c =10, a and c are digits with a from 1-9 and c from 0-9. \n\nWait, but let's see the equation again. The equation is a + 3c =10. So possible values for c can be such that 3c \u226410. Since 3c must be less than or equal to 10 (since a is at least 1). Let me see possible c values:\n\nLet me consider possible c values from 0 up to floor(10/3)=3. So c can be 0,1,2, or 3? Because 3*4=12 which is more than 10. Wait, let's check each possible c:\n\nc=0: a =10. But a must be a single digit (since it's the hundreds digit of a three-digit number), so that's invalid. So c=0 is not possible.\n\nc=1: a =10 - 3*1=7. Okay, valid (a=7 is between 1-9).\n\nc=2: a=10-6=4. That's okay.\n\nc=3: a=10-9=1. Also okay.\n\nc=4: 3*4=12, so a would be 10-12= -2. Not possible. So c can be only 1,2,3.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when c is 0, a would be 10, which is not possible. So c can be 1,2,3 only. Because for c=3, a is 1. For c=4, a would be negative. So possible c values are 1,2,3.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me re-express the equation again. \n\nEquation is a +3c =10. \n\nPossible c values must satisfy that 3c \u226410 because a has to be at least 1. So 3c \u22649 (since a can be at most 9). Wait, no, a can be up to 9, so 3c can be up to 10-1=9. So c can be up to 3 (since 3*3=9, so a would be 1). So yes, c can be 1,2,3.\n\nSo possible c values are 1,2,3. Let's list each case:\n\nCase 1: c=1 \u2192 a=7. Then M is 7b1, and N is 1b7. Since M>N, so 7b1 >1b7. Let's check if this holds. \n\nLet me think: the hundreds digit of M is 7, and N's hundreds digit is 1. Since 7>1, the number M is definitely larger than N here. So any b (0-9) is acceptable here. So for c=1, a=7, and b can be any digit from 0-9. So 10 possibilities here (b=0 to 9).\n\nCase 2: c=2 \u2192 a=10 -3*2 =4. So a=4, c=2. So M is 4b2, N is 2b4. \n\nAgain, check if M>N. The hundreds digits: 4 vs 2 \u2192 4>2, so yes, M is larger regardless of b. So here, b can be anything from 0-9. So another 10 numbers here.\n\nCase3: c=3 \u2192 a=10-3*3=1. So a=1, c=3. M is 1b3, N is 3b1. Now, here the hundreds digit of M is 1 and N's is 3. Wait, that would mean that M's hundreds digit is less than N's. But then M would be less than N unless the next digits compensate. \n\nWait a second, this is a problem. Because if a is 1 and c is 3, then M's hundreds digit is 1 and N's is 3. So the hundreds place comparison would give N's hundreds digit higher, so M would be less than N unless the tens digit (b) in M is higher than the tens digit in N. Wait, let me think:\n\nLet me write M as 100a +10b +c \u2192 100*1 +10b +3 = 103 +10b.\n\nN is 100c +10b +a \u2192 100*3 +10b +1 = 301 +10b.\n\nSo M - N = (103 +10b) - (301 +10b) = -198. But that would mean M - N is negative. But the problem states that M > N. So this case is only possible if the tens digits or units digits make M larger?\n\nWait, but in this scenario, since the hundreds digit of M is 1 and N's is 3, the hundreds digit of N is larger. So unless the tens digit of M is so much higher that it overcomes this, but since the tens digits are both b, they are the same. Wait, the tens digits are the same in both numbers. So then, the units digit of M is 3 and N's units digit is 1. Wait, so units digit: M has 3, N has 1. So units digit of M is higher. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the difference here. Let me compute M and N again when a=1, c=3.\n\nM is 100*1 +10b +3 \u2192 100 + 10b +3 = 103 +10b.\n\nN is 100*3 +10b +1 \u2192 300 +10b +1 = 301 +10b.\n\nM - N = (103 +10b) - (301 +10b) = (103-301) + (10b-10b) = -198. \n\nSo M - N is negative. Which would mean that M < N. But the problem says M > N. So this case (c=3) would not satisfy the condition M>N. \n\nOh no! So that's a problem. So this case is invalid. So when c=3, even though a is 1, the number M is actually less than N, so that's not allowed. \n\nTherefore, this case (c=3) is invalid. So only c=1 and c=2 are possible. Wait, so I must have made a mistake in considering c=3. So the possible c values are 1 and 2 only. \n\nWait, so that changes things. Let me recast that. \n\nSo when c=3, the equation gives a valid a, but the M ends up being less than N, which violates the problem's condition. Therefore, that case is invalid. So the valid c values are only 1 and 2. \n\nSo let's re-examine the cases:\n\nCase1 (c=1, a=7): M is 7b1. Since the hundreds digit of M is 7 vs 1 in N, so M is definitely larger. So here, b can be 0-9, 10 possibilities.\n\nCase2 (c=2, a=4): M is 4b2. The hundreds digit is 4 vs 2 in N, so again M is larger. So again, b can be 0-9, 10 possibilities.\n\nCase3 (c=3, a=1): As before, M is less than N, so invalid. \n\nSo total numbers so far: 10 +10=20. \n\nWait but the question says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". \n\nWait, so even though the total valid Ms are 20 (from cases 1 and 2), but we have to check which of these are greater than 300. \n\nWait, but let's see: \n\nCase1: M is 7b1. Since a=7, the number is between 700 and 799. So all of these are over 300. So all 10 are counted.\n\nCase2: M is 4b2. a=4, so the number is between 400 and 499. So all of these are also over 300. So again, 10 numbers. \n\nSo total is 20 numbers. \n\nWait but the options are A)20, B)30, C)40, D)200, E)None. \n\nSo according to this, the answer would be A)20. But wait, the options have A as 20. \n\nBut wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, the equation a + 3c =10. So for c=3, a=1, but the problem is that M is 1b3, which is 100 + 10b +3, so between 103 and 193. Which is less than 200, so definitely less than 300, but even so, the condition was M > N. But in that case, the M is less than N. So that's why that case is invalid. So indeed only cases c=1 and c=2 are valid. \n\nSo total numbers are 20. But wait, the problem says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". Since all the Ms from the valid cases (c=1 and c=2) are already over 300, then the total is 20, so answer A. \n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, when c=2, a=4. The numbers are from 400 to 499, so all over 300. And when c=1, a=7, so 700-799, so also over 300. So yes, all 20 are over 300. \n\nHmm, but let me think again if there are any other possibilities. Maybe I missed something in the equation. \n\nWait the equation was a + 3c =10. Let me check if there are other c values possible. \n\nWait, what if c=0? Then a=10, which is invalid. \n\nc=4 gives a negative a, which is invalid. \n\nc=1,2,3 only. But c=3 gives an invalid M>N. \n\nSo only c=1 and 2. So 20. So the answer should be A)20. \n\nBut the options include E) None. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation?\n\nWait let me recheck the equation. The problem says M - N + 396c =990. \n\nEarlier steps: \n\nM - N = 99a -99c. \n\nThen adding 396c gives 99a -99c +396c =99a +297c =990. \n\nDivide both sides by 99: \n\na + 3c =10. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo that equation is correct. \n\nSo then the reasoning holds. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem states that M is a three-digit number greater than N. So in the cases where c is 1 and 2, we have valid numbers. \n\nWait another thought: When c=2, a=4. So the number M is 4b2. For example, if b is 0, then M is 402, which is more than 300. All of them are. So total 20 numbers. \n\nSo why is the option A 20. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait but maybe I made a mistake in the condition M>N. Let me check with c=2. \n\nTake a=4, c=2. Let's pick b=5. Then M is 452, N is 254. 452-254=198. Then M - N +396c =198 +396*2 =198+792=990. Which matches the equation. \n\nAnother example with c=1, a=7, b=0. M=701, N=107. M-N = 594. 594 +396*1 =594+396=990. Correct. \n\nFor c=3 case: a=1, b=5. M=153, N=351. M-N = -198. Then adding 396*3 gives -198 + 1188= 990. Which also satisfies the equation. Wait, but the problem says M>N, so even though the equation holds, the condition M>N is not met here. So that case is excluded. \n\nTherefore, the only valid cases are c=1 and 2. So 20 numbers. So answer is A. \n\nHmm, but the options given include A)20, so why would the answer be E)None? Maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I missed some cases. \n\nWait let me check if there are other possible values of c where a is still valid. \n\nWait, let me see the equation a =10-3c. \n\nPossible c can be 0,1,2,3. \n\nc=0 gives a=10 (invalid). \n\nc=1 \u21927, valid. \n\nc=2 \u21924, valid. \n\nc=3 \u21921, valid (but M<N). \n\nc=4 \u2192 -2, invalid. \n\nSo only 3 possible c's, but only two are valid. \n\nWait, but what if there's a mistake in the equation? Let me check the setup again. \n\nThe problem states M - N + 396c =990. \n\nM is abc (100a+10b+c), N is cba (100c+10b+a). \n\nSo M - N = (100a +10b +c) - (100c +10b +a) = 99a -99c. \n\nAdding 396c gives 99a -99c +396c =99a +297c =990. \n\nDivide by 99: a + 3c =10. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so all steps check out. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". \n\nWait, but in case c=2, a=4. The numbers are from 400-499, which are all over 300. \n\nIn case c=1, a=7, so 700-799. All over 300. So all 20 numbers are over 300. \n\nSo the total is 20. Which is option A. \n\nHmm, so why would the options include E? Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that all b's are allowed. Let me check the constraints again. \n\nWait, the problem requires that M is a three-digit number, so a can't be 0. But in the cases where c=1 and 2, a is 7 and 4, so okay. \n\nBut also, the problem states that M must be greater than N. For c=1 and 2, as we saw, that's automatically true because the hundreds digit is higher. \n\nSo for each case, any b from 0-9 is allowed. \n\nSo 10+10=20. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be A)20. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A)20, B)30, C)40, D)200, E)None. \n\nHmm, perhaps I missed some constraints. Wait, let me check the problem statement again. \n\nThe problem says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". \n\nWait, but maybe the problem requires that N is a three-digit number. Wait, N is the reverse of M. Since M is three-digit, N will be three-digit only if c (the units digit of M) is not zero. \n\nWait, in our cases, when c is 1, 2, or 3, then N would be three-digit. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't state that N has to be a three-digit number. But since M is three-digit, and N is its reverse, if M's last digit is zero, then N would be a two-digit number. \n\nHowever, in our cases, c can only be 1,2, or 3 (since those are the possible c's that give a valid a and equation). So when c is 1,2,3, N is a three-digit number. \n\nTherefore, the cases we considered are okay. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is A)20. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something else. Let me see another angle. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, the problem says M - N + 396c = 990. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the terms. Let me re-calculate M-N again. \n\nM = 100a +10b + c \n\nN = 100c +10b + a \n\nM - N = 100a +10b +c -100c -10b -a \n\n= (100a -a) + (10b -10b) + (c -100c) \n\n= 99a -99c \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAdding 396c gives 99a -99c +396c = 99a +297c \n\nSet equal to 990 \u2192 99a +297c =990 \n\nDivide by 99 \u2192 a +3c =10. \n\nYes, correct. \n\nHmm, so everything seems to check out. \n\nSo then the answer should be 20, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, the options have E)None. Maybe I'm missing a case where even though the equation holds, there are other constraints? \n\nWait, for example, in case c=1 and a=7, is there any restriction on b? Like, maybe the problem has an additional condition? \n\nThe problem only states that M is a three-digit number, M > N, and the equation holds. So as long as a and c are correct, and b is 0-9, then it's valid. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A)20. \n\nHmm, but let me see if the problem says \"more than 300\". \n\nWait, M is a three-digit number. All three-digit numbers are at least 100. But the question asks how many M's are more than 300. \n\nIn our cases, for c=1 (a=7), M is 700-799, all over 300. \n\nFor c=2 (a=4), M is 400-499, also over 300. \n\nSo all 20 are over 300. So the count is exactly 20, so A is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. But why would there be an option E? Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps there's an error in the case where c=3? \n\nWait, in the case of c=3, even though M is less than N, but the equation holds. So the problem says \"if M > N and M - N + 396c =990\". So the conditions are both that M>N and the equation holds. So in the case of c=3, even though equation holds, since M < N, those cases are excluded. \n\nThus, only c=1 and c=2 are valid. So 20 numbers. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is A)20. Therefore, the answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about a three-digit number M = abc and its reverse N = cba. We know that M is greater than N, and when we subtract N from M and add 396 times c, the result is 990. We need to find how many such M values are there that are more than 300.\n\nHmm, first, let me write down what's given. Let me think of M as the number 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, N would be 100c + 10b + a. The condition M > N means that the original number is bigger than its reverse. \n\nThe equation given is M - N + 396c = 990. Let's substitute the expressions for M and N here. \n\nSo M - N would be (100a +10b +c) - (100c +10b +a) = 100a +10b +c -100c -10b -a. Let's compute that term by term. \n\n100a - a is 99a, 10b -10b cancels out, and c -100c is -99c. So overall, M - N = 99a -99c. \n\nSo substituting into the equation given: (99a -99c) + 396c = 990. Let me simplify that. \n\nCombine the terms with c: -99c +396c = 297c. So the equation becomes 99a + 297c = 990. \n\nHmm, maybe factor out 99? Let's see: 99(a + 3c) = 990. Dividing both sides by 99 gives a + 3c = 10. \n\nWait, that's a key equation here: a + 3c = 10. \n\nNow, since a and c are digits (since they are the hundreds and units digits of a three-digit number), their possible values are from 0 to 9. But since M is a three-digit number, a can't be 0. Similarly, c can be 0, but since N is also a three-digit number (because it's the reverse of M, which is three digits), then c can't be 0 either, right? Because if c were 0, then N would be a two-digit number. Wait, the problem doesn't specify that N is a three-digit number. Wait, the problem just says N = cba. So if c is 0, then N would be 0ba, which would effectively be a two-digit number. But the problem states that M is a three-digit number. But maybe N can be a two-digit number? Hmm, the question might not require N to be three digits, so maybe c can be 0. Let me think again.\n\nWait, but the problem says M is a three-digit number, so a can't be 0. But c can be 0. So, in the equation a + 3c =10, a and c are digits with a from 1-9 and c from 0-9. \n\nWait, but let's see the equation again. The equation is a + 3c =10. So possible values for c can be such that 3c \u226410. Since 3c must be less than or equal to 10 (since a is at least 1). Let me see possible c values:\n\nLet me consider possible c values from 0 up to floor(10/3)=3. So c can be 0,1,2, or 3? Because 3*4=12 which is more than 10. Wait, let's check each possible c:\n\nc=0: a =10. But a must be a single digit (since it's the hundreds digit of a three-digit number), so that's invalid. So c=0 is not possible.\n\nc=1: a =10 - 3*1=7. Okay, valid (a=7 is between 1-9).\n\nc=2: a=10-6=4. That's okay.\n\nc=3: a=10-9=1. Also okay.\n\nc=4: 3*4=12, so a would be 10-12= -2. Not possible. So c can be only 1,2,3.\n\nWait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, when c is 0, a would be 10, which is not possible. So c can be 1,2,3 only. Because for c=3, a is 1. For c=4, a would be negative. So possible c values are 1,2,3.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me re-express the equation again. \n\nEquation is a +3c =10. \n\nPossible c values must satisfy that 3c \u226410 because a has to be at least 1. So 3c \u22649 (since a can be at most 9). Wait, no, a can be up to 9, so 3c can be up to 10-1=9. So c can be up to 3 (since 3*3=9, so a would be 1). So yes, c can be 1,2,3.\n\nSo possible c values are 1,2,3. Let's list each case:\n\nCase 1: c=1 \u2192 a=7. Then M is 7b1, and N is 1b7. Since M>N, so 7b1 >1b7. Let's check if this holds. \n\nLet me think: the hundreds digit of M is 7, and N's hundreds digit is 1. Since 7>1, the number M is definitely larger than N here. So any b (0-9) is acceptable here. So for c=1, a=7, and b can be any digit from 0-9. So 10 possibilities here (b=0 to 9).\n\nCase 2: c=2 \u2192 a=10 -3*2 =4. So a=4, c=2. So M is 4b2, N is 2b4. \n\nAgain, check if M>N. The hundreds digits: 4 vs 2 \u2192 4>2, so yes, M is larger regardless of b. So here, b can be anything from 0-9. So another 10 numbers here.\n\nCase3: c=3 \u2192 a=10-3*3=1. So a=1, c=3. M is 1b3, N is 3b1. Now, here the hundreds digit of M is 1 and N's is 3. Wait, that would mean that M's hundreds digit is less than N's. But then M would be less than N unless the next digits compensate. \n\nWait a second, this is a problem. Because if a is 1 and c is 3, then M's hundreds digit is 1 and N's is 3. So the hundreds place comparison would give N's hundreds digit higher, so M would be less than N unless the tens digit (b) in M is higher than the tens digit in N. Wait, let me think:\n\nLet me write M as 100a +10b +c \u2192 100*1 +10b +3 = 103 +10b.\n\nN is 100c +10b +a \u2192 100*3 +10b +1 = 301 +10b.\n\nSo M - N = (103 +10b) - (301 +10b) = -198. But that would mean M - N is negative. But the problem states that M > N. So this case is only possible if the tens digits or units digits make M larger?\n\nWait, but in this scenario, since the hundreds digit of M is 1 and N's is 3, the hundreds digit of N is larger. So unless the tens digit of M is so much higher that it overcomes this, but since the tens digits are both b, they are the same. Wait, the tens digits are the same in both numbers. So then, the units digit of M is 3 and N's units digit is 1. Wait, so units digit: M has 3, N has 1. So units digit of M is higher. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the difference here. Let me compute M and N again when a=1, c=3.\n\nM is 100*1 +10b +3 \u2192 100 + 10b +3 = 103 +10b.\n\nN is 100*3 +10b +1 \u2192 300 +10b +1 = 301 +10b.\n\nM - N = (103 +10b) - (301 +10b) = (103-301) + (10b-10b) = -198. \n\nSo M - N is negative. Which would mean that M < N. But the problem says M > N. So this case (c=3) would not satisfy the condition M>N. \n\nOh no! So that's a problem. So this case is invalid. So when c=3, even though a is 1, the number M is actually less than N, so that's not allowed. \n\nTherefore, this case (c=3) is invalid. So only c=1 and c=2 are possible. Wait, so I must have made a mistake in considering c=3. So the possible c values are 1 and 2 only. \n\nWait, so that changes things. Let me recast that. \n\nSo when c=3, the equation gives a valid a, but the M ends up being less than N, which violates the problem's condition. Therefore, that case is invalid. So the valid c values are only 1 and 2. \n\nSo let's re-examine the cases:\n\nCase1 (c=1, a=7): M is 7b1. Since the hundreds digit of M is 7 vs 1 in N, so M is definitely larger. So here, b can be 0-9, 10 possibilities.\n\nCase2 (c=2, a=4): M is 4b2. The hundreds digit is 4 vs 2 in N, so again M is larger. So again, b can be 0-9, 10 possibilities.\n\nCase3 (c=3, a=1): As before, M is less than N, so invalid. \n\nSo total numbers so far: 10 +10=20. \n\nWait but the question says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". \n\nWait, so even though the total valid Ms are 20 (from cases 1 and 2), but we have to check which of these are greater than 300. \n\nWait, but let's see: \n\nCase1: M is 7b1. Since a=7, the number is between 700 and 799. So all of these are over 300. So all 10 are counted.\n\nCase2: M is 4b2. a=4, so the number is between 400 and 499. So all of these are also over 300. So again, 10 numbers. \n\nSo total is 20 numbers. \n\nWait but the options are A)20, B)30, C)40, D)200, E)None. \n\nSo according to this, the answer would be A)20. But wait, the options have A as 20. \n\nBut wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, the equation a + 3c =10. So for c=3, a=1, but the problem is that M is 1b3, which is 100 + 10b +3, so between 103 and 193. Which is less than 200, so definitely less than 300, but even so, the condition was M > N. But in that case, the M is less than N. So that's why that case is invalid. So indeed only cases c=1 and c=2 are valid. \n\nSo total numbers are 20. But wait, the problem says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". Since all the Ms from the valid cases (c=1 and c=2) are already over 300, then the total is 20, so answer A. \n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, when c=2, a=4. The numbers are from 400 to 499, so all over 300. And when c=1, a=7, so 700-799, so also over 300. So yes, all 20 are over 300. \n\nHmm, but let me think again if there are any other possibilities. Maybe I missed something in the equation. \n\nWait the equation was a + 3c =10. Let me check if there are other c values possible. \n\nWait, what if c=0? Then a=10, which is invalid. \n\nc=4 gives a negative a, which is invalid. \n\nc=1,2,3 only. But c=3 gives an invalid M>N. \n\nSo only c=1 and 2. So 20. So the answer should be A)20. \n\nBut the options include E) None. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation?\n\nWait let me recheck the equation. The problem says M - N + 396c =990. \n\nEarlier steps: \n\nM - N = 99a -99c. \n\nThen adding 396c gives 99a -99c +396c =99a +297c =990. \n\nDivide both sides by 99: \n\na + 3c =10. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo that equation is correct. \n\nSo then the reasoning holds. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem states that M is a three-digit number greater than N. So in the cases where c is 1 and 2, we have valid numbers. \n\nWait another thought: When c=2, a=4. So the number M is 4b2. For example, if b is 0, then M is 402, which is more than 300. All of them are. So total 20 numbers. \n\nSo why is the option A 20. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait but maybe I made a mistake in the condition M>N. Let me check with c=2. \n\nTake a=4, c=2. Let's pick b=5. Then M is 452, N is 254. 452-254=198. Then M - N +396c =198 +396*2 =198+792=990. Which matches the equation. \n\nAnother example with c=1, a=7, b=0. M=701, N=107. M-N = 594. 594 +396*1 =594+396=990. Correct. \n\nFor c=3 case: a=1, b=5. M=153, N=351. M-N = -198. Then adding 396*3 gives -198 + 1188= 990. Which also satisfies the equation. Wait, but the problem says M>N, so even though the equation holds, the condition M>N is not met here. So that case is excluded. \n\nTherefore, the only valid cases are c=1 and 2. So 20 numbers. So answer is A. \n\nHmm, but the options given include A)20, so why would the answer be E)None? Maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I missed some cases. \n\nWait let me check if there are other possible values of c where a is still valid. \n\nWait, let me see the equation a =10-3c. \n\nPossible c can be 0,1,2,3. \n\nc=0 gives a=10 (invalid). \n\nc=1 \u21927, valid. \n\nc=2 \u21924, valid. \n\nc=3 \u21921, valid (but M<N). \n\nc=4 \u2192 -2, invalid. \n\nSo only 3 possible c's, but only two are valid. \n\nWait, but what if there's a mistake in the equation? Let me check the setup again. \n\nThe problem states M - N + 396c =990. \n\nM is abc (100a+10b+c), N is cba (100c+10b+a). \n\nSo M - N = (100a +10b +c) - (100c +10b +a) = 99a -99c. \n\nAdding 396c gives 99a -99c +396c =99a +297c =990. \n\nDivide by 99: a + 3c =10. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so all steps check out. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". \n\nWait, but in case c=2, a=4. The numbers are from 400-499, which are all over 300. \n\nIn case c=1, a=7, so 700-799. All over 300. So all 20 numbers are over 300. \n\nSo the total is 20. Which is option A. \n\nHmm, so why would the options include E? Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that all b's are allowed. Let me check the constraints again. \n\nWait, the problem requires that M is a three-digit number, so a can't be 0. But in the cases where c=1 and 2, a is 7 and 4, so okay. \n\nBut also, the problem states that M must be greater than N. For c=1 and 2, as we saw, that's automatically true because the hundreds digit is higher. \n\nSo for each case, any b from 0-9 is allowed. \n\nSo 10+10=20. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be A)20. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A)20, B)30, C)40, D)200, E)None. \n\nHmm, perhaps I missed some constraints. Wait, let me check the problem statement again. \n\nThe problem says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". \n\nWait, but maybe the problem requires that N is a three-digit number. Wait, N is the reverse of M. Since M is three-digit, N will be three-digit only if c (the units digit of M) is not zero. \n\nWait, in our cases, when c is 1, 2, or 3, then N would be three-digit. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't state that N has to be a three-digit number. But since M is three-digit, and N is its reverse, if M's last digit is zero, then N would be a two-digit number. \n\nHowever, in our cases, c can only be 1,2, or 3 (since those are the possible c's that give a valid a and equation). So when c is 1,2,3, N is a three-digit number. \n\nTherefore, the cases we considered are okay. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is A)20. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something else. Let me see another angle. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup. \n\nWait, the problem says M - N + 396c = 990. \n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the terms. Let me re-calculate M-N again. \n\nM = 100a +10b + c \n\nN = 100c +10b + a \n\nM - N = 100a +10b +c -100c -10b -a \n\n= (100a -a) + (10b -10b) + (c -100c) \n\n= 99a -99c \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nAdding 396c gives 99a -99c +396c = 99a +297c \n\nSet equal to 990 \u2192 99a +297c =990 \n\nDivide by 99 \u2192 a +3c =10. \n\nYes, correct. \n\nHmm, so everything seems to check out. \n\nSo then the answer should be 20, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, the options have E)None. Maybe I'm missing a case where even though the equation holds, there are other constraints? \n\nWait, for example, in case c=1 and a=7, is there any restriction on b? Like, maybe the problem has an additional condition? \n\nThe problem only states that M is a three-digit number, M > N, and the equation holds. So as long as a and c are correct, and b is 0-9, then it's valid. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A)20. \n\nHmm, but let me see if the problem says \"more than 300\". \n\nWait, M is a three-digit number. All three-digit numbers are at least 100. But the question asks how many M's are more than 300. \n\nIn our cases, for c=1 (a=7), M is 700-799, all over 300. \n\nFor c=2 (a=4), M is 400-499, also over 300. \n\nSo all 20 are over 300. So the count is exactly 20, so A is correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. But why would there be an option E? Maybe I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps there's an error in the case where c=3? \n\nWait, in the case of c=3, even though M is less than N, but the equation holds. So the problem says \"if M > N and M - N + 396c =990\". So the conditions are both that M>N and the equation holds. So in the case of c=3, even though equation holds, since M < N, those cases are excluded. \n\nThus, only c=1 and c=2 are valid. So 20 numbers. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is A)20. Therefore, the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by expressing the three-digit numbers \\( M = 100a + 10b + c \\) and \\( N = 100c + 10b + a \\). Given \\( M > N \\) and the equation \\( M - N + 396c = 990 \\), we first compute \\( M - N \\):\n\n\\[\nM - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the given equation:\n\n\\[\n99a - 99c + 396c = 990 \\implies 99a + 297c = 990\n\\]\n\nDividing by 99 simplifies this to:\n\n\\[\na + 3c = 10\n\\]\n\nHere, \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits with \\( a \\geq 1 \\) (since \\( M \\) is a three-digit number) and \\( c \\) can be 0\u20139. We analyze possible values of \\( c \\):\n\n- **\\( c = 1 \\):** \\( a = 10 - 3(1) = 7 \\). Valid since \\( a = 7 \\) is a digit. \\( M \\) ranges from 700\u2013799, all over 300. \\( b \\) can be 0\u20139 (10 values).\n- **\\( c = 2 \\):** \\( a = 10 - 3(2) = 4 \\). Valid since \\( a = 4 \\). \\( M \\) ranges from 400\u2013499, all over 300. \\( b \\) can be 0\u20139 (10 values).\n- **\\( c = 3 \\):** \\( a = 10 - 3(3) = 1 \\). Here, \\( M = 1b3 \\) and \\( N = 3b1 \\). Since \\( M \\)'s hundreds digit (1) is less than \\( N \\)'s (3), \\( M < N \\), violating \\( M > N \\). Thus, invalid.\n- Higher \\( c \\) values (e.g., \\( c = 4 \\)) result in \\( a \\leq 0 \\), invalid for \\( a \\).\n\nThus, valid \\( c \\) values are 1 and 2, yielding 10 + 10 = 20 valid \\( M \\) values. All these \\( M \\) values (700\u2013799 and 400\u2013499) exceed 300. The answer is **A)20**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about three-digit numbers M and N. M is abc, which means the hundreds digit is a, tens is b, and units is c. N is cba, so it's the reverse. The problem states that M is greater than N, and when you subtract N from M and add 396c, you get 990. Then we need to find how many such M's are there that are more than 300. The options are given, but I need to figure it out step by step.\n\nHmm, first, let me write down what M and N are in terms of their digits. Since M is a three-digit number, M = 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, N = 100c + 10b + a. The problem says that M > N. So, the original number is larger than its reverse. \n\nThe equation given is M - N + 396c = 990. Let me substitute the expressions for M and N into that equation.\n\nSo, substituting:\n(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990.\n\nLet me simplify that. Let's compute the subtraction first:\n\n100a +10b +c -100c -10b -a = (100a -a) + (10b -10b) + (c -100c) = 99a -99c.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n99a -99c + 396c = 990.\n\nCombine the terms with c:\n99a + ( -99c + 396c ) = 99a + 297c = 990.\n\nHmm, so 99a + 297c = 990. Let me factor out 99 from the left side. 99(a + 3c) = 990. Dividing both sides by 99 gives a + 3c = 10.\n\nSo that equation simplifies to a + 3c = 10. That's a key equation here. \n\nNow, since a and c are digits (each from 0 to 9), but since M is a three-digit number, a can't be 0. Similarly, since N is a three-digit number (because it's cba), c can't be 0 either. So both a and c are between 1 and 9.\n\nSo the equation is a + 3c = 10. Let's find all possible integer solutions (a,c) where a and c are digits from 1-9.\n\nLet me think of possible c values. Let's see:\n\nLet's rearrange the equation to a = 10 - 3c. Since a has to be at least 1, 10-3c \u22651 \u2192 3c \u22649 \u2192 c \u22643. Also, since c has to be at least 1, possible c values are 1, 2, 3.\n\nWait, let's check each possible c:\n\nc=1: a =10-3(1)=7. So a=7, c=1. Valid.\n\nc=2: a=10-6=4. Valid.\n\nc=3: a=10-9=1. Valid.\n\nc=4: 10-12= -2. Not valid since a can't be negative. So c can only be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo possible (a,c) pairs are (7,1), (4,2), (1,3).\n\nNow, for each of these (a,c) pairs, what about the digit b? The problem didn't restrict b except that M and N are three-digit numbers, so b can be 0-9. But also, the problem states that M > N. Let's check whether the given a and c ensure that M > N regardless of b?\n\nWait, let me think. Let's see: M is abc, N is cba. Let's see if M > N given that a and c are fixed as per the above.\n\nLet's see, for example, when a is 7 and c is 1: Then M is 7b1 and N is 1b7. So comparing 7b1 vs 1b7. Since the hundreds digit of M (7) is greater than that of N (1), so M is definitely larger. So regardless of b, M will be greater than N.\n\nSimilarly for the other pairs:\n\nWhen a=4 and c=2: M is 4b2 vs N=2b4. The hundreds digit of M is 4 vs 2, so again M is larger.\n\nWhen a=1 and c=3: M is 1b3 vs N=3b1. Here, the hundreds digit of M (1) is less than N's hundreds digit (3). Wait, that's a problem. Wait, but the problem states that M > N. So in this case, when a=1 and c=3, M would be 1b3 and N would be 3b1. Since 1 <3, the hundreds digit is smaller, so M would be smaller than N unless the other digits compensate. Wait, but that's conflicting with the condition M>N. So in this case, the a and c pair (1,3) would not satisfy M>N unless the tens or units digits make up for it?\n\nWait, so maybe I have to check whether for a=1 and c=3, is there any possibility where M could still be greater than N?\n\nLet me compute M - N in that case. Let's see:\n\nM = 100*1 + 10b +3 = 103 +10b.\n\nN = 100*3 +10b +1 = 301 +10b.\n\nSo M - N = (103 +10b) - (301 +10b) = 103-301 = -198. Which is negative, so M -N is negative. So M < N. But the problem requires that M > N. So that means the case where a=1 and c=3 is invalid. Therefore, that pair (a=1, c=3) is not acceptable because even though a +3c=10, the condition M>N is not satisfied. So that combination is invalid. \n\nOh, so I made a mistake earlier. The possible (a,c) pairs are only those where a is greater than c? Wait no, not exactly. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait the equation a +3c =10 gives possible (a,c) pairs (7,1), (4,2), (1,3). But when a=1 and c=3, the hundreds digit a is less than c. So the number M would start with a=1, while N starts with 3. Thus M will always be smaller, so that pair is invalid. So we can eliminate that.\n\nTherefore, only the first two pairs are valid: (7,1) and (4,2).\n\nWait, let me confirm with the other pairs. Let's check (4,2). Then a=4 and c=2. So M is 4b2, N is 2b4. Comparing 4 vs 2 in hundreds place: so M is definitely bigger, so M>N holds. Similarly, (7,1) gives M's hundreds digit 7 vs 1, so yes.\n\nSo the valid (a,c) pairs are (7,1) and (4,2). \n\nNow, for each of these pairs, how many possible values of b are there?\n\nThe problem says that M is a three-digit number, so b can be 0 through 9. So for each a and c, b has 10 possibilities. \n\nWait, but do we have any constraints on b? Let's see. The problem's condition is already covered by the a and c selection. Since M>N is already satisfied for these a and c pairs regardless of b, then yes. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's take the first case, a=7, c=1. Then M is 7b1 and N is 1b7. The hundreds digit is 7 vs 1, so M is definitely larger. So regardless of what b is, the first digit makes M larger. \n\nSimilarly, for a=4 and c=2, the hundreds digit 4 vs 2, so again M is larger. \n\nTherefore, for each of these two (a,c) pairs, b can be 0-9, so 10 options each. \n\nSo total number of Ms would be 2 (pairs) *10 (b values) = 20. \n\nWait, but the question is asking how many values of M are more than 300. Wait, but all the Ms here are three-digit numbers. Since a is the hundreds digit. Let me check the a values. \n\nIn the first pair (7,1), a is 7, so the number M is between 700 and 799, which are all over 300. \n\nIn the second pair (4,2), a is 4, so M is 4b2, which is between 400 and 499. Also over 300. \n\nSo all of these Ms are over 300. So total is 20. So the answer would be 20, which is option A. \n\nWait but the options given are A)20, B)30, C)40, D)200, E)None. \n\nHmm, but wait, hold on. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes there might be an oversight. \n\nWait, when I considered the equation a + 3c =10, the possible c values are 1,2,3, but when c=3, a=1, which we had to exclude because M would be less than N. So only two pairs. Each with 10 b's, so 20 total. That gives 20, which is option A. \n\nBut let me check if there are any other constraints. The problem says M is a three-digit number, so a can't be zero, which is already considered. Similarly, c can't be zero because N would then start with zero, making it not a three-digit number. \n\nWait, but in the pair (a=7, c=1), c is 1, so N is 1b7, which is okay. Similarly, (a=4, c=2) gives N starting with 2, which is okay. \n\nAnother check: The equation M - N + 396c =990. Let me test with a sample number. \n\nTake a=7, c=1, let's pick b=0. So M is 701, N is 107. \n\nM - N = 701-107 = 594. Then 594 + 396*1 = 594+396=990. Which matches. \n\nAnother example: a=4, c=2, b=5. M=452, N=254. M-N=198. 198 + 396*2 = 198+792=990. Correct. \n\nAnother test with the third pair (a=1,c=3). Let's see even though it's invalid, just to check equation. M=103, N=301. M-N = -198. Then -198 + 396*3= -198 + 1188 = 990. So equation holds, but since M < N, which violates the condition given in the problem (M>N), so that case is excluded. \n\nSo my calculation seems correct. So the answer is 20, so option A. \n\nWait but let me check the question again. The question says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". Since all the possible M's here are either in 400s or 700s, which are all above 300. So all 20 qualify. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be 20, which is option A. \n\nWait but let me think again, maybe I missed another possible (a,c) pair. Let me check the equation a +3c=10 again. \n\nPossible c can be up to 3. Let me check c=0? Well c=0 would give a=10, but a has to be a single digit. So c can't be 0. \n\nWhat if c=3.5? No, since c has to be integer. So only 1,2,3. So the only possible pairs are those two. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is A)20. But let me check the options again. The options are A)20, B)30, etc. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait but maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me recheck the equation derivation again. \n\nOriginal equation: M - N + 396c =990. \n\nM is 100a +10b +c. N is 100c +10b +a. \n\nSubtracting N from M gives (100a +10b +c) - (100c +10b +a) = 99a -99c. \n\nAdding 396c gives 99a -99c +396c =99a +297c. \n\nSet equal to 990: 99a +297c =990. \n\nDivide both sides by 99: a +3c =10. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the pairs are correct. \n\nHmm. So I think the answer is A)20. So the correct option is A. \n\nWait, but the options include E) None. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". All the possible Ms here are either 400-499 or 700-799. So they are all over 300. So 20 in total. So the answer is 20, so option A. \n\nAlternatively, could there be an error in considering the possible values of b? Like, perhaps when a=4, c=2, the number is 4b2. The hundreds digit is 4, so any b (0-9) gives a valid number between 400-499, so 10 numbers. Similarly for a=7, 10 numbers. So 20 total. \n\nHmm. I think that's right. So the answer must be A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about three-digit numbers M and N. M is abc, which means the hundreds digit is a, tens is b, and units is c. N is cba, so it's the reverse. The problem states that M is greater than N, and when you subtract N from M and add 396c, you get 990. Then we need to find how many such M's are there that are more than 300. The options are given, but I need to figure it out step by step.\n\nHmm, first, let me write down what M and N are in terms of their digits. Since M is a three-digit number, M = 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, N = 100c + 10b + a. The problem says that M > N. So, the original number is larger than its reverse. \n\nThe equation given is M - N + 396c = 990. Let me substitute the expressions for M and N into that equation.\n\nSo, substituting:\n(100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990.\n\nLet me simplify that. Let's compute the subtraction first:\n\n100a +10b +c -100c -10b -a = (100a -a) + (10b -10b) + (c -100c) = 99a -99c.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n99a -99c + 396c = 990.\n\nCombine the terms with c:\n99a + ( -99c + 396c ) = 99a + 297c = 990.\n\nHmm, so 99a + 297c = 990. Let me factor out 99 from the left side. 99(a + 3c) = 990. Dividing both sides by 99 gives a + 3c = 10.\n\nSo that equation simplifies to a + 3c = 10. That's a key equation here. \n\nNow, since a and c are digits (each from 0 to 9), but since M is a three-digit number, a can't be 0. Similarly, since N is a three-digit number (because it's cba), c can't be 0 either. So both a and c are between 1 and 9.\n\nSo the equation is a + 3c = 10. Let's find all possible integer solutions (a,c) where a and c are digits from 1-9.\n\nLet me think of possible c values. Let's see:\n\nLet's rearrange the equation to a = 10 - 3c. Since a has to be at least 1, 10-3c \u22651 \u2192 3c \u22649 \u2192 c \u22643. Also, since c has to be at least 1, possible c values are 1, 2, 3.\n\nWait, let's check each possible c:\n\nc=1: a =10-3(1)=7. So a=7, c=1. Valid.\n\nc=2: a=10-6=4. Valid.\n\nc=3: a=10-9=1. Valid.\n\nc=4: 10-12= -2. Not valid since a can't be negative. So c can only be 1, 2, or 3.\n\nSo possible (a,c) pairs are (7,1), (4,2), (1,3).\n\nNow, for each of these (a,c) pairs, what about the digit b? The problem didn't restrict b except that M and N are three-digit numbers, so b can be 0-9. But also, the problem states that M > N. Let's check whether the given a and c ensure that M > N regardless of b?\n\nWait, let me think. Let's see: M is abc, N is cba. Let's see if M > N given that a and c are fixed as per the above.\n\nLet's see, for example, when a is 7 and c is 1: Then M is 7b1 and N is 1b7. So comparing 7b1 vs 1b7. Since the hundreds digit of M (7) is greater than that of N (1), so M is definitely larger. So regardless of b, M will be greater than N.\n\nSimilarly for the other pairs:\n\nWhen a=4 and c=2: M is 4b2 vs N=2b4. The hundreds digit of M is 4 vs 2, so again M is larger.\n\nWhen a=1 and c=3: M is 1b3 vs N=3b1. Here, the hundreds digit of M (1) is less than N's hundreds digit (3). Wait, that's a problem. Wait, but the problem states that M > N. So in this case, when a=1 and c=3, M would be 1b3 and N would be 3b1. Since 1 <3, the hundreds digit is smaller, so M would be smaller than N unless the other digits compensate. Wait, but that's conflicting with the condition M>N. So in this case, the a and c pair (1,3) would not satisfy M>N unless the tens or units digits make up for it?\n\nWait, so maybe I have to check whether for a=1 and c=3, is there any possibility where M could still be greater than N?\n\nLet me compute M - N in that case. Let's see:\n\nM = 100*1 + 10b +3 = 103 +10b.\n\nN = 100*3 +10b +1 = 301 +10b.\n\nSo M - N = (103 +10b) - (301 +10b) = 103-301 = -198. Which is negative, so M -N is negative. So M < N. But the problem requires that M > N. So that means the case where a=1 and c=3 is invalid. Therefore, that pair (a=1, c=3) is not acceptable because even though a +3c=10, the condition M>N is not satisfied. So that combination is invalid. \n\nOh, so I made a mistake earlier. The possible (a,c) pairs are only those where a is greater than c? Wait no, not exactly. Let me re-examine.\n\nWait the equation a +3c =10 gives possible (a,c) pairs (7,1), (4,2), (1,3). But when a=1 and c=3, the hundreds digit a is less than c. So the number M would start with a=1, while N starts with 3. Thus M will always be smaller, so that pair is invalid. So we can eliminate that.\n\nTherefore, only the first two pairs are valid: (7,1) and (4,2).\n\nWait, let me confirm with the other pairs. Let's check (4,2). Then a=4 and c=2. So M is 4b2, N is 2b4. Comparing 4 vs 2 in hundreds place: so M is definitely bigger, so M>N holds. Similarly, (7,1) gives M's hundreds digit 7 vs 1, so yes.\n\nSo the valid (a,c) pairs are (7,1) and (4,2). \n\nNow, for each of these pairs, how many possible values of b are there?\n\nThe problem says that M is a three-digit number, so b can be 0 through 9. So for each a and c, b has 10 possibilities. \n\nWait, but do we have any constraints on b? Let's see. The problem's condition is already covered by the a and c selection. Since M>N is already satisfied for these a and c pairs regardless of b, then yes. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's take the first case, a=7, c=1. Then M is 7b1 and N is 1b7. The hundreds digit is 7 vs 1, so M is definitely larger. So regardless of what b is, the first digit makes M larger. \n\nSimilarly, for a=4 and c=2, the hundreds digit 4 vs 2, so again M is larger. \n\nTherefore, for each of these two (a,c) pairs, b can be 0-9, so 10 options each. \n\nSo total number of Ms would be 2 (pairs) *10 (b values) = 20. \n\nWait, but the question is asking how many values of M are more than 300. Wait, but all the Ms here are three-digit numbers. Since a is the hundreds digit. Let me check the a values. \n\nIn the first pair (7,1), a is 7, so the number M is between 700 and 799, which are all over 300. \n\nIn the second pair (4,2), a is 4, so M is 4b2, which is between 400 and 499. Also over 300. \n\nSo all of these Ms are over 300. So total is 20. So the answer would be 20, which is option A. \n\nWait but the options given are A)20, B)30, C)40, D)200, E)None. \n\nHmm, but wait, hold on. Let me double-check my steps because sometimes there might be an oversight. \n\nWait, when I considered the equation a + 3c =10, the possible c values are 1,2,3, but when c=3, a=1, which we had to exclude because M would be less than N. So only two pairs. Each with 10 b's, so 20 total. That gives 20, which is option A. \n\nBut let me check if there are any other constraints.

So M is 701, N is 107. \n\nM - N = 701-107 = 594. Then 594 + 396*1 = 594+396=990. Which matches. \n\nAnother example: a=4, c=2, b=5. M=452, N=254. M-N=198. 198 + 396*2 = 198+792=990. Correct. \n\nAnother test with the third pair (a=1,c=3). Let's see even though it's invalid, just to check equation. M=103, N=301. M-N = -198. Then -198 + 396*3= -198 + 1188 = 990.
