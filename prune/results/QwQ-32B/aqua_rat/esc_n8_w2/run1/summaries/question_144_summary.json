      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again. The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability that event B occurs. The options are from 0.5 to 0.9. Hmm, right. \n\nAlright, since A and B are independent, that should mean that the probability of both happening is the product of their individual probabilities. Oh right, independence means P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). \n\nThe question gives me P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. I need to find P(B). Let me recall the formula for the probability of A or B happening. The general formula is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Since they are independent, the intersection P(A \u2229 B) is P(A)*P(B). \n\nSo substituting that into the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B). \n\nWe know P(A or B) is 0.96, and P(A) is 0.6. Let me plug those values in. \n\nSo 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6*P(B). Let me write that equation out again to make sure:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))\n\nHmm, let me rearrange that. Let's see, the terms with P(B) can be combined. Let's factor P(B) out. \n\nThe equation becomes: 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B)*(1 - 0.6). Because 1*P(B) -0.6 P(B) is (1-0.6)P(B). \n\nCalculating (1 - 0.6) gives 0.4. So now the equation is 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4*P(B). \n\nNow, subtract 0.6 from both sides to isolate the term with P(B):\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4*P(B)\n\n0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)\n\nSo then, solving for P(B), divide both sides by 0.4:\n\nP(B) = 0.36 / 0.4\n\nLet me compute that. 0.36 divided by 0.4. Well, 0.4 is the same as 2/5, so dividing by 0.4 is multiplying by 5/2. 0.36 * 5 = 1.8, then divided by 2 is 0.9. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 0.36 divided by 0.4. Let me do it as fractions. 0.36 is 36/100, 0.4 is 40/100. So 36/100 divided by 40/100 is (36/100)*(100/40) = 36/40 = 9/10, which is 0.9. Oh, so P(B) is 0.9? But that's option E. Wait, but let me check again because that seems high. Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over:\n\nWe have P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B) because they are independent.\n\nGiven P(A) = 0.6, P(A or B) = 0.96. So plugging in:\n\n0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6*P(B)\n\nSo, 0.96 - 0.6 = P(B) - 0.6 P(B)\n\nLeft side is 0.36, right side is 0.4 P(B). So 0.36 = 0.4 P(B), so P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9. Hmm, so that gives 0.9, which is option E. But let me think, if B has a probability of 0.9, then the probability of at least one of them is 0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6*0.9). Let me compute that. 0.6 +0.9 = 1.5, minus 0.54 (since 0.6*0.9=0.54), so 1.5-0.54 = 0.96. Oh, that checks out. So the calculation is correct. So the answer should be E)0.9. \n\nBut wait, the options given are A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9. So E is an option. Then why am I second-guessing? Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Since the probability that at least one occurs is 0.96, the probability that neither occurs is 1 - 0.96 = 0.04. Since A and B are independent, the probability that neither occurs is (1 - P(A))*(1 - P(B)). \n\nAh, that's another way to calculate. Let me try that. \n\nSo P(neither) = (1 - 0.6)*(1 - P(B)) = 0.4*(1 - P(B)) = 0.04. \n\nSo solving that equation: 0.4*(1 - P(B)) = 0.04 \n\nDivide both sides by 0.4: 1 - P(B) = 0.04 / 0.4 = 0.1 \n\nSo 1 - 0.1 = P(B) \u2192 P(B) = 0.9. \n\nSame result. So that's even simpler. So yes, that's correct. Therefore the answer must be E)0.9. \n\nHmm. The options include E, so that's the one. I think that's right. Let me check once more. \n\nOriginal problem: independent events. So the formula for neither is product of (1 - P(A)) and (1 - P(B)). So that's correct. \n\nYes, so the answer is E. I think I was just overthinking, but both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident now.\n",

The options are from A to E, with numbers like 0.5 up to 0.9. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's recall some probability rules. Since A and B are independent, that means the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other. The formula for the probability of at least one of two events occurring is P(A \u2228 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2227 B). But since they are independent, P(A \u2227 B) is P(A) * P(B). So substituting that in, the formula becomes P(A) + P(B) - P(A)*P(B) = 0.96. \n\nGiven that P(A) is 0.6, I can plug that into the equation. Let me write that out. Let me denote P(B) as x for simplicity. Then the equation becomes:\n\n0.6 + x - (0.6 * x) = 0.96.\n\nHmm, let me check that again. Yes, because the intersection is the product of their probabilities since independent. So the equation simplifies to:\n\n0.6 + x - 0.6x = 0.96.\n\nCombining like terms: the x terms are x - 0.6x which is 0.4x. So 0.6 + 0.4x = 0.96.\n\nNow, subtract 0.6 from both sides: 0.4x = 0.96 - 0.6 = 0.36. Then x = 0.36 / 0.4. Let me compute that. 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36 divided by 40, which simplifies to 0.9. Wait, 36 divided by 40 is 0.9? Wait, 40 times 0.9 is 36. Yes, that's right. So x is 0.9.

So 0.6 + 0.4x = 0.96. \n\nSubtract 0.6 gives 0.4x = 0.36. So x is 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9. Hmm. So that would be answer E. But let me think again, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's see, if B had a probability of 0.8, then plugging into the equation:\n\n0.6 + 0.8 - (0.6*0.8) = 1.4 - 0.48 = 0.92, which is less than 0.96. So that's not enough. For 0.9:\n\n0.6 + 0.9 - (0.6*0.9) = 1.5 - 0.54 = 0.96. Oh right, that works. So 0.9 is correct. So the answer would be E)0.9. Wait, but the options given include D)0.8 and E)0.9.

Since they are independent, the probability that neither occurs is (1 - P(A))*(1 - P(B)). So:\n\n(1 - 0.6)*(1 - x) = 0.04.\n\nSo 0.4*(1 - x) = 0.04. Then, 1 - x = 0.04 / 0.4 = 0.1.
