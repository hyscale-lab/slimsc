      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about the time it takes to drive versus cycling the same route. Hmm. So the worker drives at 20 km/h and takes 9 minutes. Then cycles at 6 km/h, how long does that take? \n\nFirst, I need to find the distance from home to work. Since distance equals speed multiplied by time, right? But wait, the time is given in minutes, and the speed is in hours. Oh right, I should convert the time to hours. \n\nSo driving time is 9 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 9 minutes is 9/60 hours. Let me calculate that: 9 divided by 60 is 0.15 hours. \n\nThen the distance would be speed \u00d7 time. So 20 km/h multiplied by 0.15 hours. Let me do that: 20 * 0.15 is 3. So the distance is 3 kilometers. \n\nNow, when cycling at 6 km/h, the time needed would be distance divided by speed. So 3 km divided by 6 km/h. That gives 0.5 hours. But the question asks for minutes, so I have to convert that back. 0.5 hours times 60 minutes per hour is 30 minutes. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. Let's see, driving: 20 km/h for 9 minutes. Let me think in another way. Maybe using the formula time = distance/speed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using ratios? Since the distance is the same, the time should be inversely proportional to the speed. So if the speed is 20 vs 6, the ratio of speeds is 20:6, which simplifies to 10:3. So the time ratio would be inverse, 3:10. \n\nWait, original time is 9 minutes. Let me see. Let me set up the proportion. Let me think. Let me call the time taken when cycling as t. Since distance is same, (speed1 * time1) = (speed2 * time2). \n\nSo 20 * 9 = 6 * t? Wait wait, but hold on, the units here. The speeds are in km/h, and the time for driving is in minutes. So that's a problem. Because 20 km/h multiplied by 9 minutes would not give the right units. \n\nAh right, so I need to convert the driving time to hours first. Which is what I did earlier. So the first method is correct. So the distance is 3 km. Then cycling at 6 km/h, time is 3/6 hours which is 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes. So the answer should be A)30. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A)30, B)32, C)35, D)36, E)40. So 30 is an option. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation somewhere. Let me recalculate. \n\nFirst, driving time in hours: 9 divided by 60 is indeed 0.15 hours. 20 * 0.15 is 3 km. Then cycling time: 3 divided by 6 equals 0.5 hours. 0.5 times 60 is 30 minutes. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that since 20 to 6 is a factor of 3.333..., so time would be 9 * (20/6)? Wait, no, that would be incorrect. Because time and speed are inversely proportional, so time2 = time1 * (speed1/speed2). \n\nWait, original time is 9 minutes at 20 km/h. To find the time at 6 km/h, since the speed is lower, the time should be longer. But according to my calculation, it's 30 minutes, which is longer than 9. That makes sense. \n\nWait, 30 is longer than 9, so that's correct. So 30 is the right answer. So option A. \n\nHmm, I think that's right. The possible mistake could be if I messed up the unit conversion. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: Let's find the distance first. \n\nTime in hours for driving is 9/60 = 0.15 hours. \n\nDistance = 20 * 0.15 = 3 km. \n\nCycling speed is 6 km/h. So time in hours is 3 /6 = 0.5 hours. 0.5 *60 =30 minutes. \n\nYes. So the answer must be A. The options list A as 30. So I think that's correct.\n",
