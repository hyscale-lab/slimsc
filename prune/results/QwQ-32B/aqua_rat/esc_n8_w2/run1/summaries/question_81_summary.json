      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about Arjun and Sajal's money. Let me see how to approach it. The question gives two scenarios: one where Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, and another where Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. Each scenario leads to a specific ratio of their remaining money. I need to find out how much each of them originally has. \n\nFirst, I should probably assign variables to their current amounts. Let me denote Arjun's money as A and Sajal's as S. Then I can set up equations based on the problem's conditions.\n\nThe first condition says if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. So, after the transfer, Arjun has A - 30, and Sajal has S + 30. The equation here should be S + 30 = 2*(A - 30). \n\nThe second condition is if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal has left. So in that case, Sajal has S -10, and Arjun has A +10. The equation here would be A +10 = 3*(S -10).\n\nSo now I have two equations:\n1) S +30 = 2(A -30)\n2) A +10 = 3(S -10)\n\nI need to solve these two equations simultaneously. Let me try expanding both equations first.\n\nStarting with equation 1:\nS +30 = 2A -60\nSo, bringing all terms to one side: S -2A = -60 -30 \u2192 S -2A = -90. Let me note that as equation 1a.\n\nEquation 2:\nA +10 = 3S -30\nBring all terms to left side: A -3S = -40. That's equation 2a.\n\nNow, I have two equations:\n1a) S -2A = -90\n2a) A -3S = -40\n\nHmm, maybe I can use substitution or elimination. Let's try elimination. Let's rearrange equation 1a to express S in terms of A. \n\nFrom 1a: S = 2A -90. \n\nThen substitute this into equation 2a. \n\nSo equation 2a becomes:\nA -3*(2A -90) = -40\nLet's compute that:\n\nA -6A +270 = -40 \u2192 -5A +270 = -40\nSubtract 270 from both sides: -5A = -40 -270 \u2192 -5A = -310 \u2192 A = (-310)/(-5) = 62. \n\nSo Arjun has $62. Now plug back into S = 2A -90. \n\n2*62 = 124. 124 -90 = 34. So Sajal has $34. \n\nWait, so the answer would be A (Arjun) =62 and S (Sajal)=34. Looking at the options, option B is 62,34. So that's the answer? Let me check again with the original conditions to make sure.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives 30 to Sajal. Arjun has 62-30=32. Sajal has 34+30=64. 64 is twice 32. That works. \n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives 10 to Arjun. Sajal has 34-10=24. Arjun has 62+10=72. 72 is thrice 24 (since 24*3 is 72). That also works. \n\nHmm, so that seems correct. Let me check the options again. Option B is (62,34). So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the equations again. Maybe I made a mistake in setting them up. \n\nFirst equation: After Arjun gives 30, Sajal has twice what Arjun has left. So Sajal's new amount is S+30, Arjun's is A-30. The equation S+30 = 2*(A-30) is correct. \n\nSecond equation: When Sajal gives 10 to Arjun, Arjun has thrice Sajal's remaining. So Arjun's new amount is A+10, Sajal's is S-10. The equation A+10 = 3*(S-10). That also looks right. \n\nThe solving steps also check out. So I think B is correct. Let me see the options again. Option B is indeed 62, 34. So yes, that's the right choice.\n",
