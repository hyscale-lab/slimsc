      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking, if m is greater than 0, y is also greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then m is what percentage of x? Hmm, I need to find the percentage in terms of y. Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the given information. The problem states that x is m percent of 4y. So, translating that into an equation. Remember, when something is a percentage of another, the formula is (percentage/100) * the base. So, m percent of 4y would be (m/100)*4y. Therefore, x equals that. So:\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y.\n\nI need to express m as a percentage of x. The question is asking, \"m is what percentage of x?\" So, that would be (m / x) * 100, right? Because percentage of x is (part/whole)*100, where the part here is m and the whole is x. So, the formula would be (m/x)*100. But they want this expressed in terms of y. So I need to substitute x from the equation above and solve for m in terms of y, or rather, get the expression in terms of y.\n\nLet me write down the equation again. \n\nx = (m * 4y)/100. Let's rearrange this equation to solve for m in terms of x and y. \n\nMultiply both sides by 100: 100x = 4y * m. \n\nThen, solving for m: m = (100x)/(4y). \n\nWait, but the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. Wait, maybe I need to approach this differently. Let me re-read the question to make sure I got it right.\n\nThe question says: \"m is what percentage of x?\" So, that's (m/x)*100 percent. So, to find that, I need to express (m/x)*100 in terms of y. But m and x are related through the original equation. Let me see.\n\nFrom the first equation, x = (m/100)*4y. Let me solve for m here. Let's rearrange for m:\n\nMultiply both sides by 100: 100x = 4y * m \u2192 m = (100x)/(4y). \n\nSo m = (25x)/y. Wait, because 100 divided by 4 is 25. So m = (25x)/y.\n\nNow, the question is asking for m as a percentage of x, which is (m/x)*100. Let's substitute m here. \n\n(m/x)*100 = [(25x/y)/x] *100. \n\nWait, the x cancels out here. Let's see:\n\n(25x/y divided by x) is 25/(y). Then multiply by 100: (25/y)*100 = 2500/y. \n\nOh! So that would be 2500 divided by y percent. Looking at the options, option D is 2500/y. \n\nWait a second, but let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the steps once more.\n\nOriginal statement: x is m% of 4y. So, x = (m/100) *4y. \n\nWe need m as a percentage of x. So, (m/x)*100. \n\nExpress m in terms of x and y first. From x = (m*4y)/100 \u2192 m = (x * 100)/(4y) \u2192 m = (25x)/y. \n\nThen plug that into (m/x)*100 \u2192 (25x/y divided by x) *100 \u2192 (25/y)*100 \u2192 2500/y. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer is D) 2500/y.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach it. Let me try plugging in numbers to check. Suppose I pick some numbers for m and y, compute x, then see what percentage m is of x. Let's see.\n\nLet me pick y = 10. Let me choose m such that calculations are easy. Let's say m = 25. Then x is m% of 4y. \n\n4y is 4*10 =40. m% is 25%, so x would be 25% of 40, which is 10. So x is 10. \n\nNow, m is 25, x is 10. The question is, 25 is what percentage of 10? (25/10)*100 = 250%. \n\nNow, according to the options, when y is 10, let's see which option gives 250. \n\nOption D is 2500/y \u2192 2500/10 =250. That's exactly what we have. So D gives 250. \n\nAnother test case. Let me pick y = 5, m = 50. \n\n4y is 20. m% is 50% of 20 \u2192 x is 10. \n\nSo m is 50, x is 10. 50 is what % of 10? 500%. \n\nUsing D, 2500/y \u2192 2500/5 =500. Correct again. \n\nAnother test case. Let me choose y = 25. Let me pick m = 10. \n\nThen x is 10% of (4*25)=100. 10% of 100 is 10. So x is 10. \n\nThen m is 10, x is 10. So 10 is 100% of x. \n\nUsing D, 2500/y \u2192 2500/25 =100. Perfect. \n\nHmm, so all these test cases confirm that D is correct. \n\nLooking at the options again. Option E is 5000/y. That would be double of D, so that's not right. So D is the correct answer.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about percentages, right? So I need to translate the words into equations step by step. Let me start by breaking down the question. \n\nThe question states: If m > 0, y > 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x?\n\nHmm, so first, let's parse the given information. \n\nWe know that x is m percent of 4y. The phrase \"x is m percent of 4y\" translates to an equation. Remember that \"a is b percent of c\" means a = (b/100)*c. So applying that here, x equals (m/100) multiplied by 4y. Let me write that down:\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y\n\nSimplify that equation. Let's see, 4y times m over 100. So x = (4m y)/100. Maybe I can simplify that fraction. 4 divided by 100 is 1/25, so x = (m y)/25. Wait, 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, but maybe keeping it as fractions is better for algebra. Let me check:\n\n4 divided by 100 is the same as 1/25, yes. So x = (m*y)/25. \n\nBut the question is asking: m is what percentage of x?\n\nSo, we need to find the percentage where m is some percentage of x. Let me think. The structure here is similar to the first part. If I need to find \"m is what percentage of x,\" that's the same as asking, \"m is P percent of x,\" where P is the percentage we need to find. \n\nThe formula for that would be m = (P/100) * x. Then we need to solve for P in terms of y. \n\nBut since we already have an equation connecting x, m, and y, we can substitute that in. Let's see.\n\nFrom the first equation, x = (4m y)/100. Let me rearrange that equation to express m in terms of x and y. Maybe that's helpful here. \n\nSo starting with x = (4m y)/100. Let's solve for m:\n\nMultiply both sides by 100: 100x = 4m y\n\nThen divide both sides by (4y): m = (100x)/(4y) = (25x)/y.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So substituting m into that. \n\nWait, let me think again. The question is m is what percentage of x. So using the formula m = (P/100)*x, so solving for P gives P = (m / x) * 100. \n\nSo P equals (100m)/x. \n\nBut from the first equation, we can express x in terms of m and y, so substituting that into P's formula. Let me see:\n\nWe have x = (m/100)*4y, so substituting into P = (100m)/x:\n\nP = (100m) / [ (m/100)*4y ]\n\nLet me compute that step by step. The denominator is (m/100)*4y. Let me write that as (4y m)/100. \n\nSo the equation becomes P = (100m) divided by (4y m /100). \n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So that's 100m * (100)/(4y m). \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator terms here. The m in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. \n\nSo, m cancels, so we have 100 * 100 divided by (4y). \n\n100*100 is 10,000. Then 10,000 divided by 4y is (10,000/4)/y. 10,000 divided by 4 is 2500. \n\nSo P = 2500 / y. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 2500/y and E is 5000/y. Hmm. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nLet me retrace the steps again to check. \n\nOriginal equation: x is m% of 4y. So x = (m/100) *4y. \n\nWe need to find m as a percentage of x, which is (m/x)*100. \n\nSo substituting x from the first equation into (m/x)*100:\n\n(m / [ (m/100 *4y) ]) *100. \n\nLet me compute the denominator first: (m/100)*4y = (4 m y)/100. \n\nSo the entire expression becomes m divided by (4 m y /100) multiplied by 100. \n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe first part is m divided by (4 m y /100) = m * (100)/(4 m y) = (100)/(4 y) because m cancels. \n\nThen multiply that by 100 (from the percentage formula):\n\nSo (100/(4y)) *100 = (100 * 100)/(4y) = 10,000/(4y) = 2500/y. \n\nSo that gives P = 2500/y, which is option D. \n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me try another approach. \n\nSuppose I start by expressing everything in variables. \n\nLet me let the percentage we're looking for be P. So the question is, m is P% of x. \n\nSo m = (P/100)*x. \n\nWe need to solve for P in terms of y. \n\nWe have two variables here: m and x. But we also know that x is m% of 4y, so x = (m/100)*4y. \n\nSo substituting x into the first equation: \n\nm = (P/100) * [ (m/100)*4y ]\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\nm = (P/100) * ( (m *4y)/100 )\n\nSimplify the right-hand side: (P * m *4y) / (100 * 100) \n\nSo m = (4 P m y) / 10,000 \n\nNow, let's solve for P. \n\nMultiply both sides by 10,000: 10,000 m = 4 P m y \n\nDivide both sides by m (since m is positive and not zero, we can do that):\n\n10,000 = 4 P y \n\nThen, solve for P: P = 10,000 / (4 y) \n\nWhich again gives P = 2500/y. So that's the same answer as before. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be D. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)y/400\n\nB)4y\n\nC)50y\n\nD)2500/y\n\nE)5000/y\n\nYes, D is 2500/y. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so why am I even doubting? Maybe I need to check with numbers. Let's plug in numbers to test. \n\nSuppose I choose some values for m and y, compute x, then see what the percentage should be. \n\nLet me pick m = 100 and y = 10. \n\nSo, x is m% of 4y. \n\n4y is 4*10 =40. \n\nm% is 100%, so x is 100% of 40, which is 40. \n\nSo x =40. \n\nNow the question is: m (which is 100) is what percentage of x (40)? \n\nSo 100 is what % of 40? \n\nThe formula is (100 /40)*100% = 250%. \n\nSo m is 250% of x. \n\nNow, let's plug y=10 into the options. \n\nOption D: 2500/y = 2500/10 = 250. Which is exactly 250, so that's correct. \n\nOption E would be 5000/10=500, which is too big. \n\nSo D gives 250, which matches the example. \n\nAnother example: Let me choose m = 50, y=5. \n\nThen 4y is 20. \n\nx is 50% of 20, so x=10. \n\nNow, m is 50, and x is 10. \n\nSo m is what percentage of x? 50 is what % of 10? \n\n(50/10)*100 = 500%. \n\nPlugging into the options with y=5: \n\nOption D is 2500/5 =500. Which matches. \n\nOption E would be 5000/5=1000, which is wrong. \n\nAnother test case: Let me pick y=25, m= something. Let's say y=25, m= 2500/y would be 2500/25 =100. Wait, but in this case, let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps another way. Let's take y= 25. Suppose y is 25. Let me pick m as 100 again. \n\nWait, maybe pick another m. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, let's try with y = 2500 divided by desired percentage. Hmm. Maybe another approach. \n\nWait, the answer comes out as 2500/y. Let me see if that makes sense. \n\nIf y increases, the percentage (P) decreases, which makes sense because x is proportional to y. So higher y would mean higher x, so m (which is part of that) would be a smaller percentage. \n\nAlternatively, if y is 1, then the percentage is 2500, which seems high, but let's test. \n\nTake y =1. Let m be 100. \n\nThen x = (m/100)*4y = (100/100)*4*1 =4. \n\nSo m is 100, x is 4. \n\nSo 100 is what % of 4? (100/4)*100 = 2500%. Which matches 2500/y where y is 1. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be D. \n\nThe options given include D as 2500/y. So I think that's the right choice. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key was setting up the equations correctly and then solving step by step. The numerical examples also confirm that D is correct. So the answer is D.\n",

Let me write that down:\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y\n\nSimplify that equation. Let's see, 4y times m over 100. So x = (4m y)/100. Maybe I can simplify that fraction. 4 divided by 100 is 1/25, so x = (m y)/25. Wait, 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, but maybe keeping it as fractions is better for algebra. Let me check:\n\n4 divided by 100 is the same as 1/25, yes. So x = (m*y)/25. \n\nBut the question is asking: m is what percentage of x?\n\nSo, we need to find the percentage where m is some percentage of x. Let me think. The structure here is similar to the first part. If I need to find \"m is what percentage of x,\" that's the same as asking, \"m is P percent of x,\" where P is the percentage we need to find. \n\nThe formula for that would be m = (P/100) * x. Then we need to solve for P in terms of y. \n\nBut since we already have an equation connecting x, m, and y, we can substitute that in. Let's see.\n\nFrom the first equation, x = (4m y)/100. Let me rearrange that equation to express m in terms of x and y. Maybe that's helpful here. \n\nSo starting with x = (4m y)/100. Let's solve for m:\n\nMultiply both sides by 100: 100x = 4m y\n\nThen divide both sides by (4y): m = (100x)/(4y) = (25x)/y.\n\nWait, but the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So substituting m into that. \n\nWait, let me think again. The question is m is what percentage of x. So using the formula m = (P/100)*x, so solving for P gives P = (m / x) * 100. \n\nSo P equals (100m)/x. \n\nBut from the first equation, we can express x in terms of m and y, so substituting that into P's formula. Let me see:\n\nWe have x = (m/100)*4y, so substituting into P = (100m)/x:\n\nP = (100m) / [ (m/100)*4y ]\n\nLet me compute that step by step. The denominator is (m/100)*4y. Let me write that as (4y m)/100. \n\nSo the equation becomes P = (100m) divided by (4y m /100). \n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So that's 100m * (100)/(4y m). \n\nSimplify numerator and denominator terms here. The m in the numerator and denominator will cancel out. \n\nSo, m cancels, so we have 100 * 100 divided by (4y). \n\n100*100 is 10,000. Then 10,000 divided by 4y is (10,000/4)/y. 10,000 divided by 4 is 2500. \n\nSo P = 2500 / y. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, option D is 2500/y and E is 5000/y. Hmm. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nLet me retrace the steps again to check. \n\nOriginal equation: x is m% of 4y. So x = (m/100) *4y. \n\nWe need to find m as a percentage of x, which is (m/x)*100. \n\nSo substituting x from the first equation into (m/x)*100:\n\n(m / [ (m/100 *4y) ]) *100. \n\nLet me compute the denominator first: (m/100)*4y = (4 m y)/100. \n\nSo the entire expression becomes m divided by (4 m y /100) multiplied by 100. \n\nBreaking it down:\n\nThe first part is m divided by (4 m y /100) = m * (100)/(4 m y) = (100)/(4 y) because m cancels. \n\nThen multiply that by 100 (from the percentage formula):\n\nSo (100/(4y)) *100 = (100 * 100)/(4y) = 10,000/(4y) = 2500/y. \n\nSo that gives P = 2500/y, which is option D. \n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me try another approach. \n\nSuppose I start by expressing everything in variables. \n\nLet me let the percentage we're looking for be P. So the question is, m is P% of x. \n\nSo m = (P/100)*x. \n\nWe need to solve for P in terms of y. \n\nWe have two variables here: m and x. But we also know that x is m% of 4y, so x = (m/100)*4y. \n\nSo substituting x into the first equation: \n\nm = (P/100) * [ (m/100)*4y ]\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\nm = (P/100) * ( (m *4y)/100 )\n\nSimplify the right-hand side: (P * m *4y) / (100 * 100) \n\nSo m = (4 P m y) / 10,000 \n\nNow, let's solve for P. \n\nMultiply both sides by 10,000: 10,000 m = 4 P m y \n\nDivide both sides by m (since m is positive and not zero, we can do that):\n\n10,000 = 4 P y \n\nThen, solve for P: P = 10,000 / (4 y) \n\nWhich again gives P = 2500/y. So that's the same answer as before. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be D. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)y/400\n\nB)4y\n\nC)50y\n\nD)2500/y\n\nE)5000/y\n\nYes, D is 2500/y. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so why am I even doubting? Maybe I need to check with numbers. Let's plug in numbers to test. \n\nSuppose I choose some values for m and y, compute x, then see what the percentage should be. \n\nLet me pick m = 100 and y = 10. \n\nSo, x is m% of 4y. \n\n4y is 4*10 =40. \n\nm% is 100%, so x is 100% of 40, which is 40. \n\nSo x =40. \n\nNow the question is: m (which is 100) is what percentage of x (40)? \n\nSo 100 is what % of 40? \n\nThe formula is (100 /40)*100% = 250%. \n\nSo m is 250% of x. \n\nNow, let's plug y=10 into the options. \n\nOption D: 2500/y = 2500/10 = 250. Which is exactly 250, so that's correct. \n\nOption E would be 5000/10=500, which is too big. \n\nSo D gives 250, which matches the example. \n\nAnother example: Let me choose m = 50, y=5. \n\nThen 4y is 20. \n\nx is 50% of 20, so x=10. \n\nNow, m is 50, and x is 10. \n\nSo m is what percentage of x? 50 is what % of 10? \n\n(50/10)*100 = 500%. \n\nPlugging into the options with y=5: \n\nOption D is 2500/5 =500. Which matches. \n\nOption E would be 5000/5=1000, which is wrong. \n\nAnother test case: Let me pick y=25, m= something. Let's say y=25, m= 2500/y would be 2500/25 =100. Wait, but in this case, let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps another way. Let's take y= 25. Suppose y is 25. Let me pick m as 100 again. \n\nWait, maybe pick another m. Let me think. \n\nAlternatively, let's try with y = 2500 divided by desired percentage. Hmm. Maybe another approach. \n\nWait, the answer comes out as 2500/y. Let me see if that makes sense. \n\nIf y increases, the percentage (P) decreases, which makes sense because x is proportional to y. So higher y would mean higher x, so m (which is part of that) would be a smaller percentage. \n\nAlternatively, if y is 1, then the percentage is 2500, which seems high, but let's test. \n\nTake y =1. Let m be 100. \n\nThen x = (m/100)*4y = (100/100)*4*1 =4. \n\nSo m is 100, x is 4. \n\nSo 100 is what % of 4? (100/4)*100 = 2500%. Which matches 2500/y where y is 1. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be D. \n\nThe options given include D as 2500/y. So I think that's the right choice. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in the reasoning. The key was setting up the equations correctly and then solving step by step. The numerical examples also confirm that D is correct. So the answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by translating the given information into equations. Since \\( x \\) is \\( m\\% \\) of \\( 4y \\), we write:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{m}{100} \\times 4y\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this, we get:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4my}{100} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad x = \\frac{my}{25}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine \\( m \\) as a percentage of \\( x \\). Let \\( P \\) be this percentage. The equation becomes:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{P}{100} \\times x\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x \\) from the first equation into this expression:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{P}{100} \\times \\frac{4my}{100}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying:\n\n\\[\nm = \\frac{4Pmy}{10000}\n\\]\n\nCancel \\( m \\) from both sides (since \\( m > 0 \\)):\n\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{4Py}{10000}\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\nP = \\frac{10000}{4y} = \\frac{2500}{y}\n\\]\n\nTesting with numerical examples confirms this result. For instance, if \\( m = 100 \\) and \\( y = 10 \\), \\( x = 40 \\), and \\( m \\) (100) is \\( 250\\% \\) of \\( x \\) (40), which matches \\( 2500/10 = 250 \\). Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: D",
