      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two cars starting from the same point and going the same direction at the same time. The first car is going 55 mph, and the second is 52 mph. The question is asking how long it will take before they're 15 miles apart. Hmm, let's see. \n\nAlright, so both cars start at the same time, same place, going the same direction. The first is faster, so it'll gradually pull ahead. The distance between them increases over time. I need to find the time when that distance becomes 15 miles. \n\nI remember that when two objects are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their speeds. So like, if one is going 55 and the other 52, the gap between them grows by 3 mph each hour. Because 55 minus 52 is 3. Right?\n\nSo the idea is that the distance between them increases at 3 mph. So the time it takes to get 15 miles apart would be the distance divided by the relative speed. That formula would be time = distance / speed. \n\nLet me write that out. The distance needed is 15 miles. The relative speed is 55 -52 = 3 mph. So time = 15 /3. That equals 5 hours. Wait, but let me double-check that.\n\nWait, 3 mph difference. So after one hour, they're 3 miles apart. After two hours, 6, three hours 9, four hours 12, five hours 15. Oh yeah, that adds up. So five hours would be the answer. Let me check the options. Option B is 5 hours. So the answer should be B?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me do the math again. 15 divided by 3 is indeed 5. So yes. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can approach it with equations. Let's see. Let the time be t hours. The distance covered by the first car is 55t, the second is 52t. The difference between those distances should be 15 miles. So 55t -52t =15. That simplifies to 3t=15, so t=5. Yep, that's the same result. So the answer is B)5 hours. \n\nHmm, the options given include B as 5, so that's correct. I think that's solid. I don't see any other possible way this could be. The key was recognizing that relative speed is the difference here because same direction. If they were going opposite, it would be adding, but same direction subtract. Yep, this makes sense. So the answer must be B.\n",

The first car is faster, going 55 mph, and the second is 52 mph. We need to find out how long it takes until they're 15 miles apart. Hmm.\n\nSo, since they're moving in the same direction, the distance between them will increase over time. The key here is to figure out the relative speed between the two cars. The relative speed is the difference between their speeds because they're going the same way. So the first car is moving away from the second one at 55 - 52 = 3 mph.
