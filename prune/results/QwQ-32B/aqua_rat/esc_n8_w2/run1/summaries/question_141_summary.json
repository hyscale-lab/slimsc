      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure this problem out step by step. Hmm, so the store has yellow and white golf balls. They started with 600 total. By the end of the day, they sold 80% of their inventory. Wait, so 80% of 600 is the total sold? Let me calculate that first. 80% of 600 is 0.8 * 600 = 480 balls sold in total.\n\nThe problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. But also, they sold all of their white golf balls. Oh, so all the white ones were sold. Let me parse that again. The store sold an equal number of each color, but all the white ones were sold. That means the number of white balls they had in stock must be equal to the number of yellow balls they sold. Because the number sold of each is the same. Let me think variables here.\n\nLet me denote Y as the initial number of yellow balls, and W as the initial number of white balls. So Y + W = 600, since that's the total they started with.\n\nThey sold 80% of their inventory, which is 480 balls. The total sold is 480, and since they sold equal numbers of each color, that means the number of yellow sold plus the number of white sold equals 480. But since they sold the same number of each, then each color's sold amount is half of 480? Wait, no, not exactly. Wait, the problem states \"sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls\". So the number sold of yellow is equal to the number sold of white. Let me call that number S. So S (yellow sold) = S (white sold). But the problem also says that they sold all of its white golf balls. So that means all the white balls they had were sold. Therefore, the number of white balls sold is equal to the initial number of white balls, W. So S (white sold) = W. Since the number sold of each is equal, then the number of yellow sold is also W. So Y sold = W.\n\nBut the total sold is Y sold + W sold = W + W = 2W. And that total sold is 480. So 2W = 480 \u2192 W = 240. Wait, but hold on, if W is 240, then the initial white balls were 240. Then the initial yellow balls would be 600 - 240 = 360. But let me check if that makes sense.\n\nWait, but if they sold all the white balls (240), then the yellow sold must also be 240. So total sold is 240 +240 = 480, which matches. But then the initial yellow was 360, so after selling 240, they have 120 left. But the problem doesn't say anything about remaining inventory except that they sold 80%, so that's okay. Wait, but let me check the question again. The question is asking for the number of yellow golf balls the store had to begin with. So that would be 360, which is option E. Hmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A)80, B)120, C)240, D)320, E)360. So E is 360. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me re-express the equations again to confirm.\n\nLet me define:\n\nTotal initial: Y + W = 600.\n\nTotal sold: 0.8 * 600 = 480.\n\nSold Y and W: Let Y sold = S, W sold = S (since equal numbers). Also, all white were sold, so W sold = W. Therefore S = W. So total sold is S + S = 2W = 480 \u2192 W = 240. Therefore Y = 600 - 240 = 360. So that would be E.\n\nWait, but the options include E as 360. So that seems correct. But why is there an option C)240? Maybe I confused the variables. Let me check again. The question is asking for the initial number of yellow balls, which is Y. So if W is 240, then Y is 600-240 = 360. So that's correct. Hmm, so the answer should be E) 360. But let me think again. Wait, the problem says \"sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls\". So the number sold of each is equal. Since all white were sold, then the number sold of white is W. The number sold of yellow is equal to that, so they sold W yellow. Therefore, the initial yellow must have been at least W. Because they can't sell more than they had. Since they started with Y yellow, so Y must be >= the number sold of yellow, which is W. So Y = 360, W =240. That works because they sold 240 yellow (so they had 360, so they can sell 240). That leaves 120 yellow remaining, which is okay. So yeah, the answer is E.\n\nWait, but the options given include E as 360. So why would there be options like 240? Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me re-read the problem statement again.\n\n\"the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls\"\n\nAh, so \"in doing so\" refers to selling equal numbers, which caused all white to be sold. So the number sold of white is all the white they had, so that's W. The number sold of yellow is equal to that, so W. Therefore total sold is 2W = 480 \u2192 W=240. So initial yellow is 360, so E. So that's correct. Hmm. Then why is there an option C (240) which is the number of white. Maybe someone might confuse which one is asked. The question asks for the initial yellow, so E is correct. So I think the answer is E.\n",
