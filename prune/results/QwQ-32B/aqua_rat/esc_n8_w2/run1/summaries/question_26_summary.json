      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the question says the retailer sold an appliance for 40% above cost, and that the gross profit was $20. I need to find the selling price. \n\nWait, let me make sure I understand. The gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. So if the selling price is 40% above cost, then the profit is that 40% of the cost. \n\nLet me denote the cost price as C. Then the selling price would be C plus 40% of C, which is 1.4*C. The profit here is 0.4*C, and that's given as $20. So 0.4*C = 20. \n\nTo find C, I can divide 20 by 0.4. Let's calculate that: 20 divided by 0.4 is 50. So the cost price is $50. \n\nThen the selling price is 1.4 times the cost. So 1.4 * 50 equals... 70. Oh wait, that would make the selling price $70. Let me check the options. Option D is $70.00. \n\nBut wait a second, let me verify again. If the cost is $50, then 40% of 50 is 20, so the profit is indeed $20. Then the selling price is 50 + 20 =70. That all adds up. So the answer must be D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again. \"Sold for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.\" Wait, the 40% is the markup, so the profit is 40% of cost, which is $20. So yes, the calculations are right. \n\nHmm, the options include D as 70, which matches. I think that's correct. The other options: Let me see if any could be a trap. Like option B is 51, but 51 minus cost would be... Well, if someone thought the 40% was of the selling price, then the profit would be 40% of 51, which is 20.4, but that's not exactly 20. But that's a different approach. Wait, maybe someone might have thought that 40% of the selling price is the profit. Let me see: if that were the case, then selling price S would have 0.4*S =20, so S=50. But that's not an option here. So probably that's not the case. The question states that the 40% is above cost, so the markup is on cost. So the correct way is as I did before. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D) $70.00.\n",

The question says that the retailer sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, and that this represented a gross profit of $20.00. They want to know the selling price. The options are A to E.\n\nHmm, let's think. Gross profit is usually calculated as selling price minus cost price, right? And here, the problem states that the selling price was 40% above cost. So maybe the 40% is the profit margin? Wait, I need to be careful here. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nLet me denote the cost price as C. The selling price is then C plus 40% of C, which would be 1.4 times C. So selling price S = 1.4*C. The gross profit here is S - C, which would be 0.4*C. The problem says that this gross profit is $20. So 0.4*C = $20. \n\nIf that's the case, then I can solve for C first. Let me do that. So 0.4*C = 20 \u2192 C = 20 / 0.4. Dividing 20 by 0.4, well, 0.4 is 2/5, so 20 divided by (2/5) is 20 * (5/2) = 50. So the cost price is $50. Then the selling price is 1.4 times that, so 1.4*50. Let me calculate that. 1.4 *50. 1 times 50 is 50, 0.4*50 is 20, so total 70. So the selling price is $70. \n\nLooking at the options, D is $70.00. So the answer should be D. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait, the problem says \"40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20\". Wait a second, maybe I misunderstood. Let me see. The gross profit is the amount over the cost, right? So if selling price is 40% above cost, then the profit is 40% of cost, which is exactly what I did. So 40% of cost equals $20, so cost is 50, selling price is 70. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that 40% is the profit margin relative to the selling price, but that's not the usual way. The problem says \"40 percent above cost\", which would mean that the markup is 40% of the cost. So the profit is 40% of cost.
