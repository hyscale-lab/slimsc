      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the total number of staplers produced on a Monday at a factory. Hmm. The question gives some percentages about defective and non-defective staplers, and mentions that 72 non-defective ones were rejected by mistake. I need to find the total number produced.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. First, let's denote the total number of staplers produced as, say, N. That's the number we need to find. \n\nThe problem states that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So, the defective ones would be 10% of N, which is 0.10*N. That means the non-defective ones would be the remaining 90%, right? Because 100% -10% =90%. So non-defective is 0.90*N.\n\nNow, of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. The problem says that 72 of the non-defective were rejected. So, 2% of the non-defective equals 72. Let me write that equation.\n\nThe non-defective staplers are 0.90*N. So 2% of that is 0.02 * 0.90*N. And this equals 72. \n\nSo the equation is: 0.02 * 0.90 * N = 72.\n\nLet me compute 0.02 *0.90 first. 0.02 times 0.9 is 0.018. So, 0.018*N =72. \n\nTo find N, divide both sides by 0.018. So N =72 /0.018. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 72 divided by 0.018. Let me see. Let me think of this as 72 divided by 18/1000. Which is the same as 72 * (1000/18). \n\nCalculating 72 divided by 18 first. 18*4 is 72, so that's 4. Then multiply by 1000, so 4*1000=4000. Wait, so that would give N=4000?\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. Let me do it step by step. \n\nAlternatively, 0.018 times N equals 72. \n\nSo N = 72 / 0.018. Let me compute that. Let me convert 0.018 to a fraction. 0.018 is 18 thousandths, which is 18/1000. So dividing by that is multiplying by 1000/18. \n\n72 * (1000/18) = (72/18)*1000 = 4 *1000 =4000. So yeah, that gives N=4000. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4000. So that would be the answer? Let me double-check the problem to make sure I didn't misread anything. \n\nThe problem says 10% defective. So non-defective is 90% of total. Then 2% of those non-defectives were rejected. So 2% of 90%N is 72. So yes, the equation is correct. \n\nSo solving gives N=4000, which is option A. Wait but let me check if any of the other options could be possible. Let me see. Let me try plugging in the numbers again. \n\nSuppose N is 4000. Then defective is 10% of 4000 =400. So non-defective is 3600. Then 2% of 3600 is 72, which matches exactly the problem's statement. So yes, that works. \n\nHmm. So the answer should be A)4,000. But wait, let me check another option just to be safe. Let's say someone thought the 2% was of the total, not of the non-defective. But the problem clearly states \"2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.\" So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the percentage steps. Let me see again. \n\nTotal staplers: N. \n\nDefective: 10% of N \u2192 0.1N. \n\nNon-defective: 0.9N. \n\nRejected non-defectives: 2% of 0.9N \u2192 0.02*(0.9N) = 0.018N =72 \u2192 N=72/0.018 =4000. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer must be A. \n\nWait, but why is there an option D as 4800? Maybe a common mistake is to calculate differently. Let me see: maybe someone might have thought that 2% of total, but no. Let me see: if someone thought that 2% of total staplers were rejected, then that would be different, but the problem states 2% of the non-defective. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps miscalculating the percentage steps. Let me see. Suppose someone did 2% of total non-defectives (after the defective ones are removed). So that's exactly what I did. \n\nSo yes, I think A is correct.\n",

The information given is that 10% were defective, and then 2% of the non-defective ones were rejected by mistake. And we know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. We need to find the total number produced.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Let me denote the total number of staplers produced as, say, N. So first, 10% of these are defective. That means the number of defective staplers is 0.10*N. Therefore, the non-defective ones would be the remaining 90%, which is 0.90*N. Got that part.\n\nNow, out of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake. The problem states that this number equals 72. So, the 2% of the non-defective is 72. Let me write that as an equation. \n\nSo, 2% of (non-defective) = 72. The non-defective is 0.90*N. So, 0.02 * 0.90*N =72. \n\nLet me compute that. Multiplying 0.02 and 0.90 first. 0.02 * 0.9 is 0.018. So, 0.018*N =72. \n\nTo find N, I can divide both sides by 0.018. So N =72 /0.018. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 72 divided by 0.018. Let me think. 72 divided by 0.018 is the same as 72,000 divided by 18, right? Because multiplying numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate the decimal. Wait, 0.018 is 18 thousandths. So 72 divided by 0.018 equals 72/(18/1000) ) = 72 * (1000/18). \n\nCalculating that: 72 divided by 18 is 4, so 4 *1000 is 4000. So N is 4000? Wait, but let me double-check that. Because 0.018 times 4000 would be 72? Let's see: 4000 *0.01 is 40, so 0.018 is 1.8% of 4000. 1% of 4000 is 40, so 0.8% is 32, so total 40 +32=72. Oh right, exactly.

So the rejected non-defectives are 2% of 90%N, which is 0.02*(0.9N) =0.018N. That equals 72. So solving for N gives 72/0.018 =4000. So yes, that's correct. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 4000, so the answer should be A. But wait, wait a second. Let me check if I made a mistake in the percentages. \n\nAnother way to think: Let's suppose the total is 4000. 10% defective would be 400 defective. So non-defective is 3600. Then 2% of 3600 is 72. Exactly. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer is A. But wait, the options given include A)4000. So that's correct. Hmm. But wait, I just want to make sure I didn't misread the question. \n\nThe question says \"the number of staplers produced that day\" which is N, which we found to be 4000. So yeah, that's right.
