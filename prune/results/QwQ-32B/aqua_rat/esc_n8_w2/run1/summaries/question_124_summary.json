      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem says that when 30 is subtracted from a number, it's reduced to one third of its original value. I need to find 50% of that number. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nLet me call the original number something like x. So, if I subtract 30 from x, the result is one third of x. Wait, the wording says \"it is reduced to its one third.\" Oh right, so the new value after subtracting 30 is (1/3) of the original number. So the equation would be x minus 30 equals (1/3)x. Let me write that out:\n\nx - 30 = (1/3)x\n\nHmm, solving for x here. Let me subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side. \n\nx - (1/3)x = 30 \n\nThat simplifies to (2/3)x = 30. Oh right, because 1x minus 1/3x is 2/3x. \n\nThen, to find x, I can multiply both sides by 3/2. \n\nx = 30 * (3/2) \n\nWait, 30 divided by 2 is 15, so 15 times 3 is 45. Wait, no, 30 multiplied by 3/2 would be (30*3)/2 = 90/2 = 45. So x is 45?\n\nWait, but then 50% of that number would be half of 45, which is 22.5. That's option A. But let me check again because maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me test the original problem with x=45. Subtracting 30 gives 15. And 15 is indeed one third of 45. Because 45 divided by 3 is 15. That checks out. So 50% of 45 is 22.5. So the answer would be A?\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options given are A)22.5, B)84, C)21, D)24, E)25. So A is there. But wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again.\n\n\"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" So the number after subtraction is (1/3) of the original. Yes, so the equation is correct. So the answer must be A. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems can be tricky with wording. Let me see another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is saying that when you subtract 30 from the number, the result is one third of the reduced value? Wait no, the wording is \"reduced to its one third\". The \"it\" refers to the number. So the number becomes one third of itself after subtracting 30. So the equation is correct. \n\nHmm, so then why are there other options? Let me check my calculation again. \n\nOriginal equation: x - 30 = (1/3)x \n\nSubtract (1/3)x from both sides: (2/3)x =30 \n\nMultiply both sides by 3/2: x = 30*(3/2) =45. So that's correct. 50% of 45 is 22.5. So option A. \n\nBut maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Could it be that the number is reduced by one third (meaning you subtract one third of it), but the problem says 30 is subtracted. The wording here is crucial. The problem says \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" So the subtraction of 30 causes the number to become one third of what it was. So the equation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in another interpretation. Let me see. Suppose the number is N. After subtracting 30, the result is (1/3)N. So N -30 = (1/3)N. Solving that gives N=45. So 50% of that is 22.5, which is option A. \n\nBut the options include D)24. Maybe I did something wrong here. Let me see. Let's try plugging in the options. Let's see if another answer could fit. \n\nSuppose the answer is D)24, which would mean the number is 48 (since 50% of 48 is 24). Let's check: 48-30=18. 18 is 18/48 = 3/8 of the original number, which is not 1/3. So that doesn't work. \n\nOption C)21 would mean the number is 42. 42-30=12. 12 is 12/42 = 2/7, not 1/3. \n\nOption B)84 would be 168. 168-30=138. 138 is 138/168 = 138 divided by 168 is 0.8214, which is more than half, so not 1/3. \n\nE)25 would be 50. 50-30=20. 20 is 2/5 of 50. Not 1/3. \n\nSo only option A works. Therefore the correct answer should be A. \n\nHmm, but why is option D there? Maybe a common mistake. Like if someone thought that the remaining is two-thirds instead of one third? Let's see. Suppose the equation was x-30 = (2/3)x, then x would be 90. Then 50% is 45, which isn't an option. Alternatively, perhaps the problem was phrased as \"reduced by a third\" which would mean subtract a third, but the problem says \"reduced to a third\". \n\nSo yeah, I think the correct answer is A)22.5.\n",

Let's subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get all x terms on one side. \n\nx - (1/3)x = 30 \n\nHmm, that simplifies to (2/3)x = 30.
