      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem says a number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Hmm, I need to find that number. Alright, so let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's denote the unknown number as, say, x. The problem states that the difference between x and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and x. Wait, because if it's greater than 36 by the same amount it's less than 86. Oh right, so the amount you add to 36 to get x is the same as the amount you subtract from 86 to get x. So those two differences should be equal.\n\nSo mathematically, that would be x - 36 = 86 - x. Yeah, that makes sense. Because the difference when you subtract 36 from x (how much bigger x is than 36) equals the difference when you subtract x from 86 (how much smaller x is than 86). \n\nNow I can solve that equation. Let's do that. \n\nx - 36 = 86 - x. \n\nIf I add x to both sides, I get 2x - 36 = 86. Then add 36 to both sides: 2x = 86 + 36. Let me calculate that. 86 plus 36 is 122. So 2x = 122. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 61. \n\nWait, so the number should be 61? Let me check the options. Option D is 61. \n\nBut let me verify again. Let's plug it back in. 61 - 36 is 25. And 86 - 61 is also 25. Yep, so that works. So the answer must be D)61. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem? Let me re-read. \"A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86.\" So the excess over 36 equals the deficit from 86. Yeah, that's exactly what the equation models. So I think that's correct. The other options: like 60 would give 24 and 26, which aren't equal. 56 would be 20 vs 30, nope. 51 is 15 vs 35. 41 is 5 vs 45. So only 61 gives 25 each. Yep, D is correct.\n",

Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nLet me start by understanding what the question is saying. The number in question is such that the amount by which it's larger than 36 is the same as the amount it's smaller than 86. So, the difference between the number and 36 should be equal to the difference between 86 and the number. \n\nLet me denote the number as x. Then, according to the problem, the difference (x - 36) should be equal to (86 - x). Because the amount it's greater than 36 is the same as the amount it's less than 86. \n\nSo, setting up the equation: x - 36 = 86 - x. \n\nNow I can solve for x. Let me rearrange the equation. Adding x to both sides gives: 2x - 36 = 86. Then, adding 36 to both sides: 2x = 86 + 36. What's 86 plus 36? Let me calculate that: 80+30 is 110, and 6+6 is 12, so total 122. So 2x = 122. Dividing both sides by 2 gives x = 61. \n\nWait, so that would be option D)61. Let me check the options again. The options are A)60, B)56, C)51, D)61, E)41. So D is 61. \n\nHmm, let me verify. If the number is 61, then the difference from 36 is 61-36 =25. And the difference between 86 and 61 is 25. Yes, that works. 25 equals 25. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through again. The equation x -36 = 86 -x. So adding x to both sides gives x + x -36 =86 \u2192 2x = 86 +36. 86+36 is 122, so x is 61. Yeah, that's right. \n\nWait, but maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem says the number is \"as much greater than 36 as is less than 86\". So the excess over 36 is equal to the deficit from 86. So yes, that's exactly the equation I set up. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach: the number is exactly halfway between 36 and 86. Because the distance from 36 to x is the same as from x to 86. So the average of 36 and 86 would be the midpoint. Let me see. The midpoint between 36 and 86 is (36 +86)/2. Let's calculate that. 36+86 is 122, divided by 2 is 61. So that's the same answer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D)61. The options given include D as 61, so that must be the right choice. Let me check the other options just to be sure. \n\nIf I tried option A)60: 60-36=24, and 86-60=26. Not equal. \n\nOption B)56: 56-36=20, 86-56=30. Not equal. \n\nC)51: 51-36=15, 86-51=35. Nope. \n\nE)41: 41-36=5, 86-41=45. Definitely not. \n\nSo D is the only one where the differences are equal. Therefore, I'm confident the answer is D.\n",
