      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about percentage increase after a decrease. Let me think. The product's price is reduced by 30%, and then we need to find out by what percentage it should be increased to bring it back to the original 100%. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me start by assuming the original price is 100 units. That might make it easier. So if the original price is 100, after a 30% decrease, the new price would be 70% of the original. Because 100 minus 30% of 100 is 70. So the price is now 70.\n\nNow, the question is, what percentage increase from 70 will bring it back to 100? Let me set up the equation here. Let the required percentage be x. So, increasing 70 by x% should equal 100. \n\nThe formula for percentage increase is: New price = Original price after decrease * (1 + x/100). \n\nSo plugging in the numbers: 70 * (1 + x/100) = 100. \n\nSolving for x. Let's do the math step by step. \n\nFirst, divide both sides by 70: 1 + x/100 = 100/70. \n\nCalculating 100 divided by 70 gives approximately 1.42857. So, 1 + x/100 \u2248 1.42857. \n\nSubtract 1 from both sides: x/100 \u2248 0.42857. \n\nMultiply both sides by 100: x \u2248 42.857%. \n\nHmm, so looking at the options, that's close to 42.86%, which is option B. Wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a calculation error.\n\nWait, 100 divided by 70 is exactly 10/7, right? Because 70 times 10 is 700, and 100 divided by 70 is 10/7. 10 divided by 7 is approximately 1.428571. So, the exact value is (10/7 -1) which is 3/7? Wait no, wait. Wait, 10/7 -1 is 3/7? Let me see. 10/7 is 1 and 3/7. So yes, subtract 1, so the increase is 3/7 as a decimal. 3 divided by 7 is approximately 0.42857, so 42.857%. So that's exactly 42.8571%, which rounds to 42.86%. So the correct answer is B. \n\nLet me make sure I didn't confuse the steps. The key here is that the percentage is based on the reduced price. So, if you decrease by 30%, the new base is 70, so the required percentage is (30/70)*100, but wait no. Wait, the amount needed to get back is 30 (from 70 to 100), so the percentage is (30/70)*100. Which is exactly (30/70)*100. Let me calculate that again. 30 divided by 70 is 0.42857..., so 42.857%. Exactly, so that's 42.86% when rounded to two decimal places, so B is the answer. \n\nAnother way people might get confused is thinking that a 30% decrease requires a 30% increase, but that's not correct because the base changes. For example, a 50% decrease would require a 100% increase to get back to original. So yeah, this makes sense here. So the answer must be B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about adjusting a product's price after a discount. Let me see. The problem says the price is reduced by 30%, and then we need to find out by what percentage it should be increased to bring it back to 100%. Hmm, right. I need to think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, let's start by assuming the original price is, say, $100. That makes calculations easier. If the price is reduced by 30%, then the new price after the discount would be 70% of the original. Because 100 minus 30% of 100 is 70. So the discounted price is $70.\n\nNow, the question is, what percentage increase from this discounted price ($70) is required to bring it back to the original $100. So we need to find the percentage increase from 70 to 100.\n\nThe formula for percentage increase is: [(Final Value - Initial Value) / Initial Value] * 100. \n\nPlugging in the numbers here, the initial value after discount is 70, and the final desired is 100. So the difference is 100 -70 = 30. \n\nSo the calculation would be (30 /70)*100. Let me compute that. 30 divided by 70 is 0.42857... Multiply by 100 gives approximately 42.857%. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 42.86%, which is the rounded version of that. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me think again. The key point here is that the percentage increase is based on the discounted price, not the original. So when you decrease by 30%, you can't just say 30% increase again because the base has changed. That's a common mistake. \n\nAnother way to look at it: Let's let the original price be P. After a 30% decrease, the new price is 0.7P. Let the required percentage increase be x%. So, 0.7P multiplied by (1 + x/100) should equal P again. \n\nSetting up the equation: 0.7P * (1 + x/100) = P. \n\nDivide both sides by 0.7P: (1 + x/100) = 1/0.7. \n\n1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 1.42857. So subtracting 1 gives x/100 = 0.42857, so x is 42.857%, which rounds to 42.86%. That matches option B. \n\nI think that's correct. Let me check if any other options are close. The next option is C at 43.86, which is a bit higher. But 42.857 is exactly 42.86 when rounded to two decimal places. So yes, B must be the right answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think of it as 30% decrease, so to get back you need a 30% increase? But no, that's wrong because the base is different. 30% of a lower price isn't enough. For example, 30% of 70 is 21, so adding that would get to 91, which is less than 100. So that approach is wrong. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)42.86%.\n",
