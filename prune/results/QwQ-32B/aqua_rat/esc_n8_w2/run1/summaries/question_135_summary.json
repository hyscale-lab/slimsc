      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about an organization trying to raise money from employees. They want to get 6 lakh rupees by having each employee contribute the same amount. But if each gave 60 rupees more, the total would be 6.24 lakh. We need to find out how many employees there are.\n\nHmm, let me think. Let me denote the number of employees as N. And let the original contribution per person be x rupees. So according to the first part, the total is N times x equals 6 lakh. So equation one would be N * x = 600,000. Because 1 lakh is 100,000, right? So 6 lakh is 600,000.\n\nThen the second scenario says if each contributed 60 more, the total becomes 6.24 lakh. So that would be N*(x + 60) = 624,000. Because 6.24 lakh is 624,000. \n\nSo now we have two equations:\n\n1. N * x = 600,000\n2. N*(x + 60) = 624,000\n\nI need to solve for N here. Let me subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate x. Let's see:\n\nThe second equation can be expanded as N*x + N*60 = 624,000. \n\nSubtracting the first equation (Nx=600000) gives:\n\n(Nx + 60N) - Nx = 624000 - 600000\nWhich simplifies to 60N = 24,000.\n\nWait, 624,000 minus 600,000 is 24,000. So 60N = 24,000. Then N would be 24,000 divided by 60. Let me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 60 is 400. Because 60 times 400 is 24,000. \n\nSo N is 400. Let me check the options. Option C is 400, so that's the answer. \n\nWait, let me verify again. If there are 400 employees, then original contribution per person would be 600,000 /400 = 1500. Then adding 60 makes it 1560. 400 * 1560 = 400 * 1500 is 600,000 plus 400*60 which is 24,000. So total 624,000. That's correct. \n\nSo yeah, the answer must be C)400.\n",
