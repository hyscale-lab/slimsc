      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find out what 60% of 30% of 1400 grams is. Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but let's take it step by step. \n\nFirst, the question is asking for 30% of 1400 grams first, right? Then, once I have that result, I need to find 60% of that number. Let me write this down.\n\nAlright, starting with 30% of 1400. To calculate a percentage, I remember that percentage means per hundred. So 30% is the same as 30/100 or 0.3 in decimal form. So multiplying 1400 by 0.3 should give me the first part. Let me do that: 1400 * 0.3. \n\nHmm, 1400 times 0.3. Let me think. 1400 times 0.1 is 140, so 0.3 would be three times that, which is 420. Wait, yeah, because 140 *3 is 420. So 30% of 1400 is 420 grams. \n\nNow the next part is 60% of that 420 grams. Again, converting 60% to decimal is 0.6. So multiply 420 by 0.6. Let me calculate that. \n\n420 * 0.6. Breaking it down: 400 *0.6 is 240, and 20 *0.6 is 12. Adding those together: 240 +12 =252. So that would be 252 grams. \n\nNow looking at the options, option C is 252 gms. So that's probably the answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \n\nWait, another way to approach this is to combine the percentages first. Since it's 60% of 30%, that's the same as multiplying 0.6 * 0.3 = 0.18. Then 18% of 1400. Let's see: 10% is 140, so 20% is 280, subtract 2% which is 28, so 280-28=252. Yep, same result. So that confirms it. \n\nThe options given are A)450, B)100, C)252, D)240, E)None. Since 252 is option C, that should be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes here. Both methods give the same result, so I feel confident.\n",

Let me check again. 0.6 times 420. Let's do 420 * 0.6. 400*0.6 is 240, and 20*0.6 is 12. 240+12 is indeed 252. So no, D is 240, which would be if I had done 60% of 400, but no.
