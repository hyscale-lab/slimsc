      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a computer routine that generates two numbers, x and y. The first number x is a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive. The second number y has to be less than or equal to the square root of x. The question is asking which of the given pairs does NOT satisfy this condition. So I need to check each option and find the one where y is greater than the square root of x.\n\nLet me go through each option one by one. \n\nStarting with option A: (99,10). Let me calculate the square root of 99. Hmm, sqrt(100) is 10, so sqrt(99) must be just a little less than 10. Like around 9.949 or something. So the y here is 10. But since the square root is less than 10, 10 is greater than sqrt(99). Wait, so that would mean this pair doesn't satisfy the condition? Because y has to be less than or equal to the square root. So if the square root is about 9.949, then 10 is bigger, so this pair would be invalid. But hold on, let me check the other options to make sure I didn't make a mistake here.\n\nOption B: (85,9). Let's compute sqrt(85). Well, 9 squared is 81, 10 squared is 100. So sqrt(85) is between 9 and 10. Let me calculate it more precisely. 9.2 squared is 84.64, right? 9.2^2 = 84.64. 9.22^2 would be 85. So maybe around 9.2195. So sqrt(85) is approximately 9.2195. The y here is 9, which is less than that. So 9 is okay. So this pair is valid.\n\nOption C: (50,7). The square root of 50 is about 7.071. So 7 is less than that, so 7 is okay. So that's valid.\n\nOption D: (1,1). The square root of 1 is exactly 1. So y is equal to 1, which is allowed. So that's okay.\n\nOption E: (1,0). The square root of 1 is 1, so 0 is less than that, so that's also valid.\n\nSo going back to option A: (99,10). Since the square root of 99 is approximately 9.949, which is less than 10. The y is 10, which is greater than the square root. Therefore, this pair does not satisfy the condition. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but let me check if maybe the question says \"less than or equal to the square root of the first\". So if the square root is exactly an integer, like in option D, then it's okay. But in option A, since the square root is less than 10, then 10 is not allowed. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n",
