      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out the minimum number of DVDs I need to rent each month to make the membership worth it. Hmm. So, without the membership, each DVD is $4. With the membership, it's $2 each but I have to pay $7 a month for the membership. So I need to find when the total cost with the membership becomes cheaper than without.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of DVDs as x. The total cost without membership would be 4 times x. With the membership, it's the $7 plus 2 times x. I need to find the smallest x where the membership cost is less than the non-membership cost.\n\nSo the equation would be 7 + 2x < 4x. Because when the membership's total is less, it's better to get the membership. Let me solve that inequality.\n\nSubtract 2x from both sides: 7 < 2x. Then divide both sides by 2: 3.5 < x. Since x has to be a whole number, the next integer is 4. Wait, but 3.5 would round up to 4. So the minimum is 4? Let me check the options. Option D is 4. But wait, maybe I should test the numbers to be sure.\n\nTesting x=3: Without membership: 3*4=12. With membership: 7 + 3*2=7+6=13. Oh, so at 3, the membership is actually more expensive. So 3 isn't enough. Then at 4: 4*4=16 vs 7+8=15. So 15 is less than 16, so that's better. So 4 is the minimum. So the answer should be D)4. Wait but the options include E)5? Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the inequality. Let's re-derive it. The break-even point is when 7 +2x =4x. Subtract 2x: 7 =2x \u2192 x=3.5. Since you can't rent half a DVD, you have to round up to 4. So yeah, 4 is correct. So the answer is D. The options given are D)4, so that's the right choice. The other options: like 3 would be 13 vs 12, which isn't better. So yeah, D is the answer.\n",
