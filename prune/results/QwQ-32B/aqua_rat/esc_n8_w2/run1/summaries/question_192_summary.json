      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the manufacturing cost per pen. Hmm, the company makes pens and 10% are defective, so they can't be sold. They promised to deliver 7200 pens. Wait, so the company has to produce more than 7200 because 10% are rejected. Right, so first I should find out how many pens they actually need to manufacture to end up with 7200 good ones.\n\nLet me think. If 10% are defective, then 90% are acceptable. Let the total number produced be X. Then 90% of X is 7200. So X = 7200 / 0.9. Let me calculate that. 7200 divided by 0.9 is 8000. Oh right, because 0.9 times 8000 is 7200. So they have to make 8000 pens in total.\n\nNow, the company sells each pen for Rs.10, so total revenue would be 7200 pens * 10. That's 7200*10 = 72,000 rupees. \n\nThe problem says the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. Wait, profit percentage is on the cost? Or is it on the revenue? Hmm, I need to be careful here. The wording says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". Maybe the profit is calculated on the cost price. Let me think again.\n\nProfit percentage is generally calculated on cost unless stated otherwise. Let me recall the formula. Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price. Profit percentage is (Profit / Cost Price)*100. \n\nBut here, the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. So perhaps the total selling price gives a 25% profit over the total manufacturing cost. So total revenue is equal to total cost plus 25% of total cost. So total revenue = 1.25 * total cost.\n\nWait, that's possible. Let's see. Let me structure it step by step.\n\nLet the total manufacturing cost be C. Then the selling price (revenue) must be C plus 25% of C, so 1.25*C. \n\nSo Revenue = 1.25*C. \n\nWe know the revenue is 72,000. So 72000 = 1.25*C \u2192 C = 72000 / 1.25. Let me compute that. 72000 divided by 1.25. Well, 72000 divided by 5 is 14,400, so times 4 gives 57,600. So total cost is 57,600. \n\nTherefore, the total manufacturing cost for all 8000 pens is 57,600. Then the cost per pen is 57,600 divided by 8000. Let me calculate that. 57600 divided by 8000. Let's see: 8000 *7 is 56,000. 57600-56000 = 1600. So 1600 /8000 = 0.2. So total per pen cost is 7 + 0.2? Wait, no. Wait 57600 divided by 8000 is 7.2? Wait, 8000 * 7 = 56,000. 57600-56000 = 1600. 1600 divided by 8000 is 0.2. So 7 +0.2 = 7.2. So 7.2 per pen. \n\nWait but the options include B as 7.2. So that would be the answer? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify the steps again.\n\nFirst, total pens needed to produce: 7200 / 0.9 = 8000. Correct. \n\nTotal revenue is 7200 pens sold at 10 each: 72,000. \n\nThe profit is 25% on the total manufactured pens. The problem states \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". Hmm, perhaps the wording here is a bit ambiguous. Wait, maybe the 25% is the profit margin on the selling price? Or on cost?\n\nWait, the question says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". The term \"on all the manufactured pens\" might mean that the profit is calculated relative to the cost of those pens. So the total revenue is selling price, which is 72,000. The total cost is C. Profit is 25% of the cost. So Profit = 0.25*C. \n\nRevenue = Cost + Profit \u2192 72,000 = C + 0.25C \u2192 1.25C = 72,000 \u2192 so same as before, so C is 57,600. So total cost is 57,600. Divided by 8000 pens gives 7.2. So the cost per pen is 7.2. Which is option B. \n\nHmm, but wait another way to think: Maybe the 25% is the profit margin on the selling price. Let me see. If profit is 25% of the selling price, then total cost would be 75% of the revenue. But that would give a different answer. Let me check.\n\nIf the profit is 25% of the selling price, then:\n\nTotal revenue = 72,000. Profit is 25% of that, so 18,000. Then cost would be 72,000 -18,000 =54,000. Then cost per pen would be 54000 /8000 =6.75. But that's not an option here. The options have 7.2 and 6 etc. So probably the first interpretation is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read again.\n\n\"the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\"\n\nHmm, perhaps \"on all the manufactured pens\" refers to the profit margin on the cost. So the total cost is C, the selling price is 1.25*C, which matches the first calculation. So then the per pen cost would be 7.2, which is option B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using markup instead of margin. Wait, markup is different. Markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. Markup percentage is (selling price - cost)/cost. Profit percentage can sometimes be confused. But in business terms, profit percentage is usually on cost unless specified otherwise. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem states that the profit is 25% of the selling price. But then the answer would be different. Let me see the options again. The options are A)6, B)7.2, C)5.6, D)8, E) none. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let's suppose that the company's total cost is C. The total revenue is 72,000. The profit is 25% of the total cost. So profit is 0.25*C. So total revenue must equal total cost plus profit. 72,000 = C + 0.25C \u2192 1.25C =72000 \u2192 C=57600. So per pen cost is 57600/8000 =7.2. So that's correct. So B is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the profit as per pen. Let me see. Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Let me check another approach. Let me suppose that the cost per pen is x. Then total cost for 8000 pens is 8000x. \n\nThe total revenue is 7200 pens *10 =72000. \n\nThe profit is 25% of the total cost. So Profit = 0.25*(8000x). \n\nProfit is also equal to revenue minus cost. So:\n\nRevenue - Cost = 0.25 * Cost \u2192 72000 - 8000x = 0.25*(8000x)\n\nLet me write that equation again:\n\n72000 - 8000x = (0.25)(8000x)\n\nSimplify the right side: 2000x\n\nSo 72000 -8000x = 2000x\n\nCombine terms:\n\n72000 = 10000x \u2192 x=72000 /10000 \u2192 x=7.2. Yep, same answer. So that confirms it. So the cost per pen is 7.2, so B is correct. \n\nSo the answer should be B.\n",

Or is it on the selling price? The question says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". Hmm, maybe the profit is 25% of the cost. \n\nWait, profit is usually calculated as (selling price - cost)/cost * 100. So if the overall profit is 25%, that would mean that the selling price gives a 25% profit over the cost. \n\nBut let's think step by step. Let me denote variables. Let me see.\n\nLet the manufactured cost per pen be C. The company has to produce enough pens so that after 10% are rejected, they have 7200 good ones. So how many do they need to manufacture?\n\nIf 10% are defective, then 90% are acceptable. Let total manufactured be N pens. Then 0.9*N = 7200. So N = 7200 /0.9 = 8000 pens. So they have to make 8000 pens. \n\nThe total cost for manufacturing all pens would be 8000 * C. \n\nThe total revenue is 7200 * 10 = 72,000 Rs. \n\nThe profit is 25% on the total manufactured cost. So Profit = 25% of total cost. \n\nSo, Profit = 0.25*(Total Cost). \n\nBut Profit is also Revenue - Total Cost. \n\nSo, Revenue - Total Cost = 0.25*(Total Cost). \n\nRearranging, Revenue = Total Cost + 0.25 Total Cost = 1.25 * Total Cost. \n\nTherefore, Total Cost = Revenue /1.25. \n\nPlugging in numbers: Revenue is 72,000.

Let me see. \n\nIf the profit percentage was on the selling price, then the calculation would be different. Let me think. \n\nSuppose the profit is 25% of the selling price. Then total revenue is 72,000. The profit would be 25% of that, so 18,000. Then total cost would be 72,000 - 18,000 = 54,000. Then per pen cost would be 54,000 /8000 = 6.75, which isn't an option here. Since the problem says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\", which probably means on cost. \n\nSo the first approach is correct. The answer should be B)7.2. \n\nWait, but let me check another angle. The problem says \"the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". Maybe the profit is 25% of the manufactured cost.

So per pen cost is 7.2? \n\nWait, so the answer would be B) 7.2? \n\nWait let me double check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the profit calculation. Let me confirm. \n\nThe problem states the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. So profit is 25% of the cost. So selling price (total revenue) must equal cost plus 25% of cost, which is 1.25*C. \n\nYes, so the total cost is 57,600. Divided by 8000 pens gives 7.2. So the cost per pen is 7.2. So the answer should be B. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options. The options are A)6, B)7.2, C)5.6, D)8. So B is there. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the 25% is on the selling price? Let me see. \n\nIf the profit percentage was on the selling price, then the calculation would be different. Let me think. \n\nSuppose the profit is 25% of the selling price. Then total revenue is 72,000. The profit would be 25% of that, so 18,000. Then total cost would be 72,000 - 18,000 = 54,000. Then per pen cost would be 54,000 /8000 = 6.75, which isn't an option here. Since the problem says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\", which probably means on cost. \n\nSo the first approach is correct. The answer should be B)7.2. \n\nWait, but let me check another angle. The problem says \"the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". Maybe the profit is 25% of the manufactured cost. So the total selling price is 125% of the total cost. Which is exactly what I did. So that's correct. \n\nYes, I think that's right. So the answer is B.\n\n\nTo determine the manufactured cost per pen, first calculate the total number of pens produced. Since 10% are defective, the company must produce \\( \\frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000 \\) pens. The total revenue from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each is \\( 7200 \\times 10 = 72,000 \\) Rs. \n\nThe company's overall profit is 25% of the total manufacturing cost. Let \\( C \\) be the total manufacturing cost. Profit is \\( 0.25C \\), and revenue equals cost plus profit:  \n\\[\n72,000 = C + 0.25C = 1.25C \\implies C = \\frac{72,000}{1.25} = 57,600 \\text{ Rs}.\n\\]\n\nThe cost per pen is \\( \\frac{57,600}{8000} = 7.2 \\) Rs. \n\nThus, the manufactured cost of each pen is **Rs. 7.2**.\n\nAnswer: B",
