      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the marked price of a sewing machine so that after giving a 20% discount, Karan still makes a 20% profit. Hmm. Alright, I need to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cost price for Karan is Rs. 1200. He wants a 20% profit on this cost. So, the selling price after the discount should be such that it gives him that 20% profit. Let me calculate the desired selling price first.\n\nWait, the profit percentage is on the cost price. So, 20% of 1200 is 0.2 * 1200 = 240. So the selling price should be 1200 + 240 = 1440. That's the amount he needs to get after the discount. \n\nBut the discount is 20% off the marked price. Let me think. Let's denote the marked price as M. If there's a 20% discount, the customer pays 80% of M. So the selling price after discount is 0.8 * M. And this needs to equal the desired selling price of 1440. \n\nSo the equation would be 0.8 * M = 1440. To find M, divide both sides by 0.8. \n\nLet me calculate that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 1440 divided by 0.8 is the same as 1440 multiplied by 1.25. Let me do 1440 * 1.25. \n\n1440 * 1 is 1440, and 1440 * 0.25 is 360. Adding them together gives 1440 + 360 = 1800. Wait, but 1800 is one of the options (E). But the options given here include E as 1800. Wait, but the options here have B as 1875, which is higher. Did I make a mistake?\n\nHold on, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again. Let me do 1440 divided by 0.8. \n\nAlternatively, 0.8 times M equals 1440. So M = 1440 / 0.8. \n\nCalculating that: 1440 divided by 0.8. Let's see, 0.8 is 4/5. So dividing by 4/5 is multiplying by 5/4. So 1440 *5 is 7200, divided by 4 is 1800. So that's correct. Then why are the other options higher? Wait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again.\n\nThe question says \"even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit.\" So the cost is 1200, profit is 20% on cost. So selling price after discount must be 1200 *1.2 =1440. So the marked price must be such that 80% of it is 1440, so marked price is 1800. But option E is 1800. Hmm. But the options given here have B as 1875. Wait, maybe the question is different. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)1,879; B)1,875; C)1,876; D)1,872; E)1,800. Oh, so E is 1800. That's exactly what I got. But the problem is, maybe I made a mistake in the steps? Let me see again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 20% profit is calculated on the selling price, not the cost? Wait, no, typically profit percentage is on cost unless stated otherwise. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says \"he makes 20% profit.\" Usually, that's on cost. Let me confirm:\n\nSuppose the selling price after discount is S. Profit is 20% on cost. So S = 1200*(1 + 20/100) = 1440. That's correct. So the marked price must be S / (1 - 0.20) = 1440 /0.8 =1800. So the answer should be E. But looking at the options, E is there. But why do the other options have numbers like 1875? Maybe I missed something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the interpretation of the discount. Let me think again. Maybe the discount is 20% on the marked price, so the selling price is 80% of M. And that selling price must give a 20% profit on cost. So yes, that's exactly what I did.\n\nHmm. Let me see the options again. Option E is 1800. So that's the correct answer. But why are the other options there? Let me check if I made an error in calculations.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recalculate:\n\n1200 + 20% profit is 1200 *1.2 =1440. Correct. \n\nThen, the discounted price (80% of M) must equal 1440. So M is 1440 divided by 0.8. Let's compute that: 1440 divided by 0.8. \n\nDividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 10/8, which is 5/4. 1440 * 5 =7200, divided by 4 is 1800. So yes. That's right. \n\nHmm. So then the answer must be E) 1800. But why do the other options exist? Let me check the problem statement again. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me read again: \"so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit.\" The cost is 1200. So the calculations are correct. So the answer is E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in Indian Rupees, but that's not an issue. Or maybe the profit is 20% on the marked price? Let me check that scenario. \n\nWait, if the 20% profit is on the marked price, then the calculation would be different. Let's see. Suppose profit is 20% of M. But that's not standard. Profit is usually on cost. Let me see:\n\nSuppose profit percentage is on the selling price. Then the problem would be different. Let me try that. \n\nSuppose the selling price after discount gives a 20% profit on cost. Which is the same as before. Wait, maybe the problem states that the profit is 20% on the selling price? Let me see the problem again. \n\nThe problem says \"he makes 20% profit.\" Without specifying, the standard is cost. So unless stated otherwise, profit% is on cost. \n\nHmm. Unless there's a different interpretation. Wait, maybe the question is in another way. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that after giving a discount of 20%, the profit is 20% of the marked price? No, that would be non-standard. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the marked price. Let me try with option B) 1875. Let's see what happens. \n\nIf marked price is 1875, then 20% discount is 375, so the selling price is 1500. Then, the cost is 1200. Profit is 300. 300/1200 is 25% profit. That's higher than 20%. So that would be more than desired. \n\nHmm. So 1875 gives a 25% profit. So that's not the answer. \n\nWait, if the answer is E, then why is the option B there? Let me see if the problem is maybe 20% over the selling price. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the profit is 20% of the selling price. Then:\n\nLet S be the selling price. Profit is 20% of S. \n\nSo cost price = S - 0.2S = 0.8S. \n\nGiven that CP is 1200, so 0.8S = 1200 \u2192 S = 1500. \n\nThen, the marked price M would be S / 0.8 \u2192 1500 / 0.8 = 1875. \n\nAh, so that would lead to option B. \n\nAh, here's the confusion. The problem states \"makes 20% profit\". If the profit is calculated on the selling price instead of the cost, then the answer would be different. \n\nSo which is correct? The standard is that profit percentage is on cost unless stated otherwise. But perhaps the question expects profit on the selling price. That could be a point of confusion. \n\nHmm. Let me verify the standard. Generally, profit percentage is calculated on cost unless specified otherwise. So in that case, the answer should be E) 1800. \n\nBut let me check both scenarios. \n\nFirst case: profit on cost (20% of cost). \n\nSP = 1200 + 20% of 1200 = 1440. \n\nMarked price M: 1440 is 80% of M \u2192 M = 1800. \n\nSecond case: profit on SP. \n\nLet SP be S. Profit is 20% of S. So SP = cost + 20% SP \u2192 S = (1200)/(1 - 0.2) = 1500. Then M = 1500 /0.8 = 1875. \n\nSo the question's answer depends on whether the profit is on cost or selling price. \n\nThe problem says \"makes 20% profit\". Typically, profit percentage is on cost. But maybe in some contexts, it's on SP. \n\nThe question is from an Indian context, perhaps? Maybe in some syllabi, profit is calculated on SP? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check the question again. Let me read once more:\n\n\"so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit\". The term \"makes 20% profit\" without any qualifier usually refers to cost price. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be E) 1800. \n\nBut the options given here have E as 1800. So then that's correct. \n\nBut why are the other options there? Maybe a common mistake is to calculate profit on SP. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Wait, let me see the options again. \n\nWait the options given in the problem are:\n\nA)1,879\n\nB)1,875\n\nC)1,876\n\nD)1,872\n\nE)1,800\n\nSo E is there. So the correct answer should be E. \n\nHmm. So why do the other options exist? Maybe I'm missing something else. \n\nWait, perhaps the question says \"20% discount on the marked price\" leading to a 20% profit on the cost. That's exactly what I did. So the answer is E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another way. Let me recheck the math again. \n\nLet me go through the steps again:\n\nCost price (CP) = 1200. \n\nDesired profit is 20% on CP. \n\nSo desired selling price (SP) = 1200 * 1.2 = 1440. \n\nThe discount offered is 20% on the marked price (MP). So SP = MP - 20% of MP = 80% of MP. \n\nSo SP = 0.8 * MP \u2192 MP = SP / 0.8 = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a different discount percentage? Let me read again. The discount is 20%, so that's correct. \n\nHmm. So perhaps the options are wrong, but according to the given options, E is present. So the correct answer is E. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is E) 1800. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options again, B is 1875, which would be if the profit was on SP. Since that's a common confusion, maybe the question expects that? \n\nWait the question says \"makes 20% profit\". If profit is 20% on cost, then the answer is E. But if it's 20% on the selling price, then B. \n\nHmm. Let me think of another approach. Let me see. \n\nLet me denote variables:\n\nLet MP be the marked price. \n\nAfter 20% discount, SP = 0.8 * MP. \n\nProfit is 20% on CP (1200). So SP must be 1200 *1.2 = 1440. \n\nThus 0.8 MP = 1440 \u2192 MP = 1800. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, if profit is 20% on MP, then SP would be MP - cost = profit. Wait no, profit is 20% of MP? Then:\n\nProfit = 0.2 * MP. \n\nSP = CP + Profit \u2192 SP = 1200 + 0.2 MP. \n\nBut also, SP = 0.8 MP. \n\nThus 0.8 MP = 1200 + 0.2 MP \u2192 0.6 MP = 1200 \u2192 MP = 2000. \n\nWhich is not an option. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using some other method. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the calculation of percentage. \n\nWait maybe the question is asking for a 20% profit after the discount, so the total selling price must be 20% more than cost. So that's exactly what I did. \n\nHmm. I think I have to stick with E as the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is E)1,800.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the marked price (M) of the sewing machine, we first calculate the desired selling price (SP) after a 20% discount that still yields a 20% profit on the cost price (CP) of Rs. 1200. \n\n1. **Calculate the desired Selling Price (SP):**\n   - The 20% profit on the cost price is \\( 1200 \\times 0.20 = 240 \\).\n   - Therefore, the required SP is \\( 1200 + 240 = 1440 \\).\n\n2. **Relate SP to the Marked Price (M):**\n   - The SP after a 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the marked price.\n   - Thus, \\( 0.80 \\times M = 1440 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for M:**\n   - \\( M = \\frac{1440}{0.80} = 1800 \\).\n\nThe calculations confirm that the marked price should be **Rs. 1800**, which corresponds to option **E**. \n\nAnswer: E",

I think I have to stick with E as the correct answer. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is E)1,800.\n\n\nTo determine the marked price (M) of the sewing machine, we first calculate the desired selling price (SP) after a 20% discount that still yields a 20% profit on the cost price (CP) of Rs. 1200. \n\n1. **Calculate the desired Selling Price (SP):**\n   - The 20% profit on the cost price is \\( 1200 \\times 0.20 = 240 \\).\n   - Therefore, the required SP is \\( 1200 + 240 = 1440 \\).\n\n2. **Relate SP to the Marked Price (M):**\n   - The SP after a 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the marked price.\n   - Thus, \\( 0.80 \\times M = 1440 \\).\n\n3. **Solve for M:**\n   - \\( M = \\frac{1440}{0.80} = 1800 \\).\n\nThe calculations confirm that the marked price should be **Rs. 1800**, which corresponds to option **E**. \n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. So the problem is about figuring out the marked price of a sewing machine so that after giving a 20% discount, Karan still makes a 20% profit. Hmm, I need to think step by step here.\n\nFirst, the cost price is Rs. 1200. He wants a 20% profit on that. So, what's the selling price after the discount? Let me calculate the desired selling price first.\n\nProfit is 20% of cost, so 20% of 1200. That would be 0.2 * 1200 = 240. So the selling price needs to be 1200 + 240 = 1440. Wait, right. So the final selling price after discount should be 1440.\n\nBut the discount is 20%, which means the selling price is 80% of the marked price. Because if you take 20% off, you're paying 80% of the original marked price. So let me denote the marked price as M. Then 80% of M equals the selling price (1440). \n\nSo equation: 0.8 * M = 1440. To find M, divide 1440 by 0.8. Let me compute that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 1440 divided by 0.8 is the same as 1440 multiplied by 1.25. Let me see, 1440 * 1.25. \n\nBreaking it down: 1000 *1.25 is 1250, 400*1.25 is 500, and 40*1.25 is 50. So adding those: 1250+500 is 1750, plus 50 makes 1800? Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, maybe I did that wrong. Let me try again. \n\nAlternatively, 1440 divided by 0.8. Let's do straight division. 1440 divided by 0.8. 0.8 goes into 1440 how many times? \n\nWell, 0.8 times 1800 would be 1440, because 0.8 times 1000 is 800, so 0.8 * 1800 is 1440. So M would be 1800. But wait, option E is 1800, but let me check the options again. The options are A)1879, B)1875, C)1876, D)1872, E)1800. So E is 1800. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, let me recheck the steps again. \n\nThe cost price is 1200. Desired profit is 20%, so selling price after discount must be 1200*(1 + 20/100) = 1200*1.2 = 1440. Correct. \n\nThen the discount is 20%, so the selling price is 80% of the marked price. So marked price is 1440 / 0.8 = 1800. So the answer would be E) 1800. But wait, the options given have E as 1800. But the options listed here include that. Hmm. Wait, but the options in the question are A to E. Let me check again the options. Oh the options are A)1,879; B)1,875; C)1,876; D)1,872; E)1,800. So E is indeed 1800. But why are the other options like 1875 etc. Maybe I did something wrong here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again. The question says \"even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit\". So the 20% profit is on cost, and the discount is on the marked price. So my approach seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the profit is calculated on the selling price? Wait, no. Usually profit percentage is on cost unless stated otherwise. Let me confirm. \n\nWait, the standard is that profit percentage is calculated on cost price unless specified. So 20% profit on cost. So the steps are correct. \n\nHmm, so then why are the options different? Maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate 1440 divided by 0.8 again. 1440 divided by 0.8:\n\n0.8 \u00d7 1800 = 1440. So yes, 1800. So E is correct. But the options given in the problem have E as 1800, so that's the answer? But the options listed here have E as 1800, so the answer must be E. But the options given in the problem include E as 1800, so that's the correct one. Wait but why are the other options like 1875? Let me check again. Maybe I miscalculated the selling price?\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose the marked price is M. After 20% discount, the selling price becomes 0.8*M. The cost is 1200. The profit is 20% on cost, so the selling price must be 1200 *1.2 = 1440. So 0.8*M =1440 \u2192 M= 1440/0.8 = 1800. That's correct. So the answer must be E. But in the options, E is 1800. So the correct answer is E. \n\nBut maybe the question says 20% profit on the marked price? Wait, the problem says \"he makes 20% profit\". Typically, profit is on cost, unless stated otherwise. If profit was on the selling price, the calculation would be different. Let me check that scenario just to be sure. \n\nSuppose the 20% profit is on the selling price. Let me see. Let SP be the selling price. Then profit is 20% of SP, so cost price is SP - 20% SP = 80% SP. So 1200 = 0.8 SP \u2192 SP=1200/0.8 = 1500. Then, the marked price would be SP /0.8 = 1500 /0.8 = 1875. Which is option B. But that's only if the profit is on the selling price. \n\nHmm, so the question is ambiguous? But the standard practice is that profit percentage is on cost. So unless stated otherwise, perhaps the first approach is correct. But since the options include 1875, maybe the question expects profit to be on the selling price. \n\nWait, the question says \"he makes 20% profit\". So profit is calculated on cost unless stated otherwise. Let me confirm with examples. \n\nFor example, if you buy something for 100 and sell for 120, that's 20% profit on cost. Profit percentage is usually on cost. \n\nSo in that case, the correct answer is E) 1800. But the options given here have E as 1800. So that should be correct. However, the options given in the problem have B as 1875. Maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the profit is on cost. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I messed up the equations. Let me try the alternative approach where profit is 20% on the selling price. \n\nLet me denote SP as selling price. Profit is 20% of SP. So:\n\nCost Price = SP - (20% of SP) = 80% of SP. \n\nSo 1200 = 0.8 SP \u2192 SP = 1200 /0.8 = 1500. \n\nThen, the marked price M is such that after 20% discount, SP is 0.8 M. \n\nSo 0.8 M = 1500 \u2192 M = 1500 /0.8 = 1875. Which is option B. \n\nHmm, so depending on whether the profit is on cost or selling price, the answer could be E or B. \n\nThe problem statement says \"makes 20% profit\". The standard is that profit percentage is on cost unless stated otherwise. So the first approach is correct. But perhaps in some regions or contexts, it's different. \n\nWait, maybe I need to check the question again. The problem says \"even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit\". The profit here would be on the cost price. So the first calculation holds. \n\nWait, let me re-calculate the first scenario. \n\nCost price = 1200. Desired profit is 20% of 1200 = 240. So selling price must be 1440. \n\nMarked price after 20% discount: 1440 is 80% of M. So M = 1440 /0.8 = 1800. \n\nSo that's E. \n\nBut the options given have E as 1800. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me check the numbers again. The cost is 1200. \n\nIf the answer is E, then the marked price is 1800. 20% discount on 1800 is 360, so selling price is 1440. Profit is 1440-1200=240. Which is 20% of 1200. Correct. \n\nSo that's correct. So the answer is E. \n\nBut why are the other options there? Like B is 1875. Maybe a common mistake where people calculate profit on SP. Let me see what happens if someone does that. \n\nIf someone mistakenly calculates profit on SP, they get 1875, which is option B. But according to standard definitions, profit is on cost. \n\nHmm, maybe the question is from a source where profit is considered on SP? Not sure. But according to the standard method, the answer is E. \n\nWait, but the options given in the problem's options include E as 1800, which is the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n",
