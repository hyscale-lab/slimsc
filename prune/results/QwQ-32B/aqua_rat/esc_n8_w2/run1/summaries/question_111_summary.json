      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem about percentages of employees taking winter and summer vacations. Hmm. The question is asking for the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter one. Alright, so I need to figure that out using the given information.\n\nFirst, let me list out the given data. 75% take a winter vacation. Then, 40% take both winter and summer. And 20% take neither. So, I need to find the percentage that takes summer but not winter. \n\nHmm, maybe using a Venn diagram with two circles: one for winter and one for summer. Let me think. Let me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The total percentage taking either winter or summer vacation would be the sum of those taking winter plus those taking summer minus those taking both. But also, since 20% take neither, that means 80% take at least one of them. \n\nWait, right. So total employees not in neither group is 100% -20% =80%. So that 80% is the union of winter and summer. \n\nSo, the formula is: \n\nWinter \u222a Summer = Winter + Summer - Both\n\nSo, substituting the known values: \n\n80% = 75% (winter) + Summer% - 40% (both)\n\nLet me write that equation again. \n\n80 = 75 + S - 40, where S is the percentage taking summer.\n\nSolving for S: \n\n80 = (75 -40) + S \u2192 80 = 35 + S \u2192 S = 80 -35 = 45. \n\nWait, so 45% take summer. But the question is asking for those who take summer but not winter. \n\nAh right, because the 40% is the overlap (both). So the summer-only group would be total summer minus both. \n\nSo Summer only = S - Both = 45% -40% =5%?\n\nWait that would be 5%? But that's option A. But that seems low. Let me check again. \n\nWait maybe I made a mistake here. Let's go through step by step again. \n\nTotal percentage taking winter is 75%. \n\nBoth are 40%. \n\nNeither is 20%, so the ones taking at least one (winter or summer) is 80%. \n\nSo using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nWinter + Summer - Both = 80%\n\nSo 75 + S -40 = 80. \n\nSo 75 -40 is 35, so 35 + S =80 \u2192 S=45. So summer total is 45%. \n\nTherefore, the summer but not winter would be Summer only = 45% -40% =5%. \n\nHmm. So 5% is the answer? That's option A. But let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm mixing up something. Let me draw a Venn diagram. \n\nImagine two overlapping circles: W (winter) and S (summer). \n\nThe winter circle has 75%, summer has S% which we found as 45%. Their intersection is 40%. \n\nSo the part of summer that's not overlapping is 45-40=5. \n\nBut 5% seems really low. Let me check if the math is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me verify again:\n\nWinter only: 75% - 40% (both) =35% \n\nSummer only: S -40% \n\nNeither:20% \n\nSo total should be: winter only + both + summer only + neither =100% \n\nSo 35% (winter only) +40% (both) + (S -40) (summer only) +20% (neither) =100 \n\nAdding those up: 35+40 + (S-40) +20 = 35+40 is 75, plus (S-40) is 75 + S -40 = 35 + S, plus 20 gives 35 + S +20 = S +55. \n\nWait, that total is S +55 =100 \u2192 S =45. So that's consistent. \n\nThen summer only is 45-40=5. So the answer is 5%, which is option A. \n\nHmm. But maybe I'm missing something here. Let me see another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is worded differently. Let me re-read the problem. \n\nThe question states: 40% take both winter and summer. 20% take neither. \n\nSo, total in neither is 20, so in at least one is 80. \n\nWinter is 75, so the remaining in the summer only would be 80 - winter + ... Wait, maybe I can think of the summer only as total in summer minus both. \n\nBut according to the equation, the summer total is 45, so summer only is 5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting a different answer. Let me check the options again. The options are A)5, B)15, C)25, D)35, E)45. \n\nHmm, so 5 is an option. But maybe I messed up the inclusion-exclusion. Let me try again. \n\nWait the formula is: \n\nWinter \u222a Summer = Winter + Summer - Both \n\nWe know that the union is 80%, so 80 =75 + Summer -40 \n\nSo 80 = (75-40) + Summer \u2192 35 + Summer =80 \u2192 Summer is 45. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nSo summer only is 45-40 =5. \n\nHmm. So the answer should be A)5%. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something here. Let me see another way. \n\nLet me use a table. Let's say there are 100 employees. \n\nTotal employees:100. \n\nWinter:75. So not winter:25. \n\nBoth vacations:40. \n\nNeither:20, so 20 people are in neither. \n\nSo the number taking at least one is 80. \n\nThe 40 both are part of the winter and summer. \n\nThe winter only is 75 total winter minus 40 both \u2192 35. \n\nSo winter only:35, both:40, neither:20. \n\nSo summer only must be 80 (total taking at least one) minus winter only (35) minus both (40) \u2192 80-35-40 =5. \n\nYes, that's 5. So summer only is 5. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A. \n\nHmm, so I think that's correct. The answer is 5%.\n",

The question is asking for the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter one. \n\nAlright, let's jot down the given information first. \n\nFirst, 75% take a winter vacation. Let's note that as W = 75%. Then, 40% take both winter and summer vacations. So the intersection of W and S (summer) is 40%. Also, 20% take neither. That means 80% take at least one of the vacations, right? Because neither is 20%, so 100 - 20 = 80.\n\nI remember that in set theory, the formula for two overlapping sets is: \n\nTotal = W + S - Both + Neither. Wait, no, actually the formula is: \n\nTotal = (W + S - Both) + Neither. But since Total is 100%, maybe rearranged. Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the union. The formula for union is W \u222a S = W + S - W \u2229 S. \n\nSo the percentage taking either winter or summer or both would be W + S - Both.

Because the union (those who take either) is equal to W plus S minus their intersection. So plugging the numbers:\n\n75 + S - 40 = 80. \n\nLet me solve for S. \n\n75 - 40 is 35, so 35 + S = 80. Then S must be 45? Wait, so 45% take summer? \n\nBut wait, the question is asking for those who take summer but not winter.

But of those, 40% are taking both. So the ones who took summer but not winter would be 45 -40 =5. That's 5%, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, that seems contradictory? Because if 40% take both and 5% take only summer, then the total summer is 45. But 40% taking both is higher than the summer only? That's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think of another way. \n\nLet me use a Venn diagram approach.

Wait, the total in either is winter plus summer only, but subtracting the overlap? Wait, no, the total in either is winter + summer only + both? No, no, the winter includes the both. \n\nAlternatively, the total in at least one is (winter only) + (summer only) + both. \n\nWinter only is 75 total winter minus 40 both = 35. \n\nSummer only is x. \n\nBoth is 40. \n\nSo total in at least one is 35 + x +40 = 75 +x. \n\nWe know that total in at least one is 80 (since 20 are neither). \n\nSo 75 + x =80 \u2192 x=5. \n\nYes, that gives the same result.

Let \\( W \\) represent the percentage taking a winter vacation (75%), \\( S \\) the percentage taking a summer vacation, and \\( B \\) the percentage taking both (40%). The percentage taking neither is 20%, so 80% take at least one vacation. \n\nUsing the formula for the union of two sets:\n\\[\nW + S - B = 80\\%\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n75\\% + S - 40\\% = 80\\%\n\\]\nSolving for \\( S \\):\n\\[\n35\\% + S = 80\\% \\implies S = 45\\%\n\\]\nThe percentage taking only a summer vacation is the total summer vacationers minus those taking both:\n\\[\nS - B = 45\\% - 40\\% = 5\\%\n\\]\nThis matches option A. Verifying with a Venn diagram approach confirms the result: winter only (35%), both (40%), and summer only (5%) sum to 80%, consistent with the 20% neither. \n\nAnswer: A",
