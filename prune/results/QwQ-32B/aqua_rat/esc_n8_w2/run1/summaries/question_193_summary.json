      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem where a two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Also, the unit's digit is twice the ten's digit. Hmm, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me denote the ten's digit as, say, x. Then the unit's digit must be double that, so 2x. Since it's a two-digit number, the actual number can be represented as 10 times the ten's digit plus the unit's digit. So the number would be 10x + 2x. Wait, no, that's 12x? Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The ten's place is x, so 10*x, and the unit's place is 2x, so adding those gives 10x + 2x = 12x. Oh right, so the number is 12x. \n\nNow, the problem says the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. The sum of the digits is x + 2x = 3x. So the number (which is 12x) minus the sum (3x) equals 18. So 12x - 3x = 18. That simplifies to 9x = 18, so x = 2. \n\nWait, so the ten's digit is 2, and the unit's digit is 2*2=4. So the number should be 24? Let me check the options. Option B is 24. But wait, hold on. Let me verify this because sometimes I might have messed up.\n\nLet me plug back into the problem. The number is 24. Sum of digits is 2 +4=6. Then 24 -6 is 18. Oh yes, that works. So that's correct. But wait, looking at the options, there's also 42 and 48. Let me see if I made a mistake here. Wait, maybe I did the setup wrong?\n\nWait, the problem says the number is two digits. Let me re-express the variables again. Let me think again. Let me try to set it up again properly. Let me define variables again.\n\nLet the ten's digit be x, unit's digit y. According to the problem, the number is 10x + y. The sum of the digits is x + y. The problem states that the number exceeds the sum by 18, so:\n\n10x + y = (x + y) + 18. \n\nAlso, the unit's digit is double the ten's: y = 2x. \n\nSo substituting y =2x into the first equation:\n\n10x + 2x = (x + 2x) +18\n\n12x = 3x +18\n\nSubtract 3x: 9x=18 \u2192 x=2. Then y=4. So the number is 24. So that's B. \n\nBut wait, the options include 42 and 48. Let me check again. Because maybe I mixed up the digits? Wait, if the ten's digit is x, then 10x + y is correct. So if x is 2, the number is 24, which is correct. \n\nHmm, but let me check the other options. Let's see option C is 42. Let's test that. For 42, the sum of digits is 4+2=6. 42-6=36, which is way more than 18. So that's not it. \n\nOption D is 48: sum 4+8=12, 48-12=36 again. Not 18. \n\nOption E is 49: sum 13, 49-13=36. Not right. \n\nOption A is 12: sum 1+2=3. 12-3=9, which is not 18. So only 24 works. \n\nHmm, so why am I confused? Because maybe I thought 42 would be a possible answer? But no, according to the problem, the unit digit is double the ten's. So in 42, the unit digit is 2, which is half of 4, so that's the reverse. So the ten's digit must be smaller. So 24's unit digit is 4 which is double 2. That's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B)24. But wait, the options given are A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49. So B is the answer. \n\nWait, but I just thought of another way. Let me see if there's another possible interpretation. Maybe I made an error in the equation setup. Let me check again. \n\nThe problem says \"exceeds the sum of the digits by 18\". So the number is equal to sum plus 18. So yes, 10x + y = (x + y) +18. Which gives 9x=18, so x=2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check if x and y are digits, so they must be between 0 and 9. Since x is the ten's digit, it can't be 0. So x is 2, y is 4. So 24. \n\nHmm, I think that's correct. So the answer is B. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me see again. \n\nWait, another way: Let's suppose the number is N. Let the ten's digit be a, unit's digit b. Then N =10a +b. The sum is a +b. The problem says N = (a +b) +18. Also, b=2a. \n\nSo substituting N =10a +2a =12a. Then 12a = (a +2a) +18 \u2192 12a =3a +18 \u21929a=18 \u2192a=2. So yes, same result. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)24. So I think that's correct. The options must have other numbers to trick, but B is the right one. So I think the answer is B.\n",

Wait, the unit's digit is 2x, so the number is 10x + (2x) which would be 12x. But let me make sure that's right.

The sum of the digits is x + 2x, which is 3x. So the number (which is 12x) minus the sum (3x) equals 18. So 12x - 3x = 18. That simplifies to 9x = 18. So x would be 2.
