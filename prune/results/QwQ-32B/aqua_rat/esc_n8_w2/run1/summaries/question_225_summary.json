      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a rectangular parking space that's marked by painting three of its sides. The unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. We need to find the area. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's visualize this. A rectangle has four sides. Since three sides are painted, one side isn't. The unpainted side is given as 9 feet. Wait, but which side is that? Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, the sides could be arranged such that either one length or one width is the unpainted one. Wait, the problem says the unpainted side is 9 feet. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the sides. Let's assume that the parking space has length L and width W. The problem mentions that three sides are painted. The unpainted side must be one of the sides. Since the rectangle has two lengths and two widths, the three painted sides must consist of either two lengths and one width or two widths and one length. But which scenario?\n\nWait, the unpainted side could be either a length or a width. Let's consider both possibilities.\n\nCase 1: The unpainted side is the length (so L=9). Then, the three painted sides would be the other length and the two widths. Wait, no. Wait, if the rectangle is placed such that the unpainted side is one of the lengths, then the three painted sides would be one length (the other side) and the two widths. Wait, no, maybe. Let's think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the three sides painted are adjacent. Like, imagine the parking space is against a wall, so they only need to paint three sides. For example, if the wall is one side, then the three sides painted would be the other three. So the unpainted side is one side, which could be a length or a width. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify the orientation, so maybe we need to figure it out based on the given data.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to set variables and write equations. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose the rectangle has length L and width W. Let's say the unpainted side is one of the lengths (so L = 9). Then the three painted sides would be the other length (L) and the two widths (W each). So the sum of the painted sides would be L + 2W = 37. Since L is 9, then substituting: 9 + 2W = 37 \u2192 2W = 28 \u2192 W =14. Then the area would be L*W =9*14=126. Hmm, option C is 126. But let me check the other case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the unpainted side is a width. Then W=9. The three painted sides would then be the two lengths (each L) and one width (the other side). So sum would be 2L + W =37. Since W is 9, then 2L +9=37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Then the area would be L*W=14*9=126. Wait, same result. Oh! So regardless of whether the unpainted side is a length or a width, the area comes out the same?\n\nWait, that's interesting. Let me check again.\n\nIf the unpainted side is a length (L=9):\n\nPainted sides: L + 2W = 37 \u2192 9 +2W=37 \u2192 W=14 \u2192 area=9\u00d714=126.\n\nIf the unpainted side is a width (W=9):\n\nPainted sides: 2L + W =37 \u2192 2L +9=37 \u2192 L=14 \u2192 area=14\u00d79=126. Yep, same.\n\nSo in either case, the area is 126, which is option C. But let me check the options again. The options are A)46, B)81, C)126, D)252, E)None. So C is there, so the answer should be C?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me redo the calculations.\n\nFirst scenario: unpainted side is length (so L=9). Then the three painted sides are another length (9) and two widths. The sum is 9 + 2W =37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Area 9\u00d714=126. Correct.\n\nSecond scenario: unpainted side is a width (W=9). The three painted sides are two lengths and one width. So 2L +9 =37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area is 14\u00d79=126. Same. So either way, the area is 126. So the answer is C. Then why is option E there? Maybe I missed something?\n\nWait, perhaps the question is saying three sides are painted, but perhaps the sides are not the adjacent ones? Like maybe two lengths and one width? Wait, but in a rectangle, the sides are arranged such that adjacent sides are of different lengths. Wait, perhaps the three sides painted are two lengths and one width, but that would require the unpainted side to be a width. Wait, but that's what I considered in the second scenario. Alternatively, maybe the three sides are arranged differently, but I think the logic holds. Because regardless of which side is unpainted, the equations lead to the same area. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me see. The problem says \"three of its sides\" are painted. So the fourth side is not painted. Since it's a rectangle, the four sides are two lengths and two widths. So the unpainted side could be a length or a width, but in either case, the equations work out as above. Thus, the area is 126, so answer C is correct. The options include C, so the answer should be C. Then why is E an option? Maybe I'm missing something else?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is not that the sides are of length and width, but maybe the sides are the perimeter sides. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let me think again. Let me denote the sides as follows. Let's say the parking space is a rectangle with length L and width W. The three painted sides must add up to 37. The unpainted side is one of them, which is 9. So the three painted sides are the other three. Let me think of all four sides: two of length L and two of width W. The unpainted side is one of them, so the three painted sides are either:\n\nCase 1: If the unpainted side is a length (so L=9), then the painted sides are the other length (9) and the two widths (each W). So total painted length is 9 + 2W =37 \u2192 same as before.\n\nCase 2: If the unpainted side is a width (so W=9), then the painted sides are the two lengths (each L) and the other width (9). So total is 2L +9 =37 \u2192 same as before.\n\nThus, in either case, the area is L*W=14*9=126. So the answer is C. Therefore, the correct option is C. The options given include C, so the answer must be C. Therefore, the answer is option C, 126. So I think that's correct.\n",

Let me think of the rectangle as having sides in order. Let's say the parking space is along the street, so maybe the unpainted side is the front, which is a length. Then the three sides painted would be the back (same as front, length) and the two sides (the widths). So in that case, the sum of the painted sides is (length) + 2*(width) = 37. Since the unpainted length is 9, then length is 9, so 9 + 2W=37 \u2192 W=14. So area is 9*14=126. \n\nAlternatively, if the unpainted side is a width (so the width is 9). Then the three painted sides would be the two lengths and one width. So the sum is 2L + W =37. Since W is 9, then 2L = 37-9=28 \u2192 L=14. Then area is 14*9=126 again. \n\nSo in either scenario, the area is the same. So the answer must be 126, which is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)46, B)81, C)126, D)252, E)None. Since 126 is an option, so answer is C. \n\nHmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the sides. Let me confirm once more. Let me denote variables:\n\nLet the sides be length L and width W. The unpainted side is 9. So either L=9 or W=9. \n\nCase 1: Unpainted is a length (so L=9). The three painted sides would be the other length (9) and the two widths (each W). So total painted sides: 9 + 2W =37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Area L\u00d7W=9\u00d714=126.\n\nCase 2: Unpainted is a width (so W=9). The three painted sides would be the two lengths (each L) and one width (9). So total painted sides: 2L +9 =37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Area is 14\u00d79=126 again. \n\nYes, either way, area is same. So the correct answer is C. Therefore, the answer must be C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we consider the two possible scenarios where the unpainted side is either the length or the width of the rectangle. \n\n**Case 1: Unpainted side is the length (L = 9 feet):**  \nThe painted sides include the other length (9 feet) and the two widths (W). The sum of the painted sides is:  \n\\[\n9 + 2W = 37 \\implies 2W = 28 \\implies W = 14 \\text{ feet}.\n\\]\nThe area is then:  \n\\[\nL \\times W = 9 \\times 14 = 126 \\text{ square feet}.\n\\]\n\n**Case 2: Unpainted side is the width (W = 9 feet):**  \nThe painted sides include the two lengths (L) and one width (9 feet). The sum of the painted sides is:  \n\\[\n2L + 9 = 37 \\implies 2L = 28 \\implies L = 14 \\text{ feet}.\n\\]\nThe area is then:  \n\\[\nL \\times W = 14 \\times 9 = 126 \\text{ square feet}.\n\\]\n\nIn both scenarios, the area is **126 square feet**, which corresponds to option **C**.\n\nAnswer: C",
