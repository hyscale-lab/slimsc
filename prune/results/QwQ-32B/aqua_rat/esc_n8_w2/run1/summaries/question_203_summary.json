      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the father is dividing Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan. Their current ages are 23 and 24, so when they reach 26, that means Mohan will be 26 in 3 years (since 26-23=3) and Sohan will be there in 2 years (26-24=2). The key here is that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, will be equal when they turn 26. So I need to find the present amounts each gets so that after compounding for different periods (3 and 2 years respectively), their amounts are the same.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. The total is M + S = 5100. The problem says that after their respective investment periods, the amounts will be equal. So the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r)^t, right? Since it's compounded annually, I think the formula applies here. \n\nSo for Mohan's amount after 3 years: M*(1 + 0.04)^3. And Sohan's after 2 years: S*(1 +0.04)^2. These two should be equal. \n\nTherefore, setting them equal: M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2. \n\nHmm, maybe I can simplify this equation. Let's divide both sides by (1.04)^2, then we get M*1.04 = S. So S = 1.04*M. \n\nNow, since M + S = 5100, substituting S gives M + 1.04M = 5100. That adds up to 2.04M = 5100. \n\nSolving for M would be 5100 divided by 2.04. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 5100 divided by 2.04. Let's see, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100? Wait, 2.04 * 2500 would be 2.04*2500. 2500*2 is 5000, and 2500*0.04 is 100, so total 5100. Oh! So 2.04*M =5100 \u2192 M=5100/2.04 =2500. Wait, so Mohan's share is 2500? Then Sohan's would be 1.04*2500 =2600. Wait, but 2500+2600 is 5100. That checks out. \n\nWait, but let me confirm again. Because if Mohan gets 2500, then after 3 years: 2500*(1.04)^3. Sohan gets 2600, after 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2. Are these equal?\n\nLet me compute both. Let's calculate (1.04)^2 first. That's 1.0816. So Sohan's amount would be 2600 *1.0816 = 2600*1.0816. Let's see, 2600 *1 is 2600, 2600*0.08=208, 2600*0.0016=4.16. So total would be 2600 +208 +4.16 = 2812.16? Wait, maybe better to do exact calculation:\n\n2600 *1.0816. Let me compute 2600 * 1.0816:\n\nFirst, 2600 *1 =2600.\n\n2600 *0.08 = 208.\n\n2600 *0.0016 = 4.16.\n\nAdding them up: 2600 + 208 is 2808, plus 4.16 gives 2812.16.\n\nNow Mohan's amount: 2500*(1.04)^3. Let's compute (1.04)^3. 1.04 cubed. 1.04 *1.04 is 1.0816, then multiply by 1.04 again: 1.0816 *1.04. Let me do that step by step:\n\n1.0816 *1.04: \n\n1.0816 *1 =1.0816\n\n1.0816 *0.04 =0.043264\n\nAdding together gives 1.0816 +0.043264 = 1.124864. So (1.04)^3 =1.124864.\n\nThus, 2500 *1.124864 = ?\n\n2500 *1.124864. Let's compute 2500 *1 =2500, 2500 *0.12 = 300, 2500 *0.004864=12.16. So adding up:\n\n2500 + 300 =2800, plus 12.16 =2812.16. \n\nSo both amounts are indeed equal at 2812.16. So that checks out. \n\nSo Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B. Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)2400, B)2500, C)2600, D)2700, E) None. So B is 2500, which matches. \n\nWait but the question says \"Find Mohan's share\". So the answer should be B. \n\nHmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the sons. Wait, Mohan is 23, so he needs 3 years. Sohan is 24, so 2 years. The calculation was correct. So the shares are M=2500 and S=2600, which sum to 5100. So yes, correct. So the answer is B.\n",

The key point here is that the shares are invested at 4% compound interest, and they should end up with equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find out Mohan's share. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many years each will have their money invested. Since they need to reach age 26, let's calculate the time difference. \n\nMohan is 23 now, so he'll be 26 in 3 years (26-23=3). Sohan is 24, so he'll reach 26 in 2 years (26-24=2). \n\nThe problem states that after these respective periods, their investments will have grown to the same amount through compound interest at 4% per annum. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), but since it's compounded annually, n=1. So the formula simplifies to A = P*(1 + r)^t, where r is the rate in decimal and t the time in years.\n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as x and Sohan's share as y. Since the total is 5100, x + y = 5100. \n\nThe amounts after their respective times should be equal. So:\n\nx*(1 + 0.04)^3 = y*(1 + 0.04)^2\n\nBecause Mohan's money is invested for 3 years and Sohan's for 2. \n\nLet me write that equation again. Let me also note that (1.04)^3 divided by (1.04)^2 is 1.04, so maybe I can simplify this equation. \n\nWait, rearranging the equation: x/y = (1.04)^2 / (1.04)^3 = 1/1.04. Wait, no, let's see:\n\nWait, the equation is x*(1.04)^3 = y*(1.04)^2. If I divide both sides by (1.04)^2, I get x*(1.04) = y. So y = x*1.04. \n\nSo substituting back into the total sum: x + y = x + 1.04x = 2.04x = 5100. \n\nTherefore, x = 5100 / 2.04. Let me compute that. \n\nHmm, 5100 divided by 2.04. Let me see. Let me think of 2.04 times 2500 is 5100? Wait, 2.04 * 2500: 2500*2 is 5000, and 2500*0.04 is 100, so total 5100. Oh! Wait a second. Because 2.04 multiplied by 2500 is indeed 5100. \n\nWait, but according to the equation above, 2.04x =5100, so x would be 5100 divided by 2.04. Which would be 5100/2.04. Let me compute that.\n\nAlternatively, since 2.04x =5100, x = 5100/(2.04). Let me compute that. Let me see: 5100 divided by 2.04. \n\nHmm, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100, so 5100 divided by 2.04 is 2500. So x is 2500. Wait, but then y would be 2500 *1.04 = 2600. \n\nWait, but then x + y would be 2500 + 2600 = 5100, which matches the total. \n\nSo Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B. \n\nWait, but let me confirm again. The problem says Mohan is 23, so he has 3 years, and Sohan is 24, so 2 years. The equation setup was correct. \n\nLet me check the calculation again. \n\nx*(1.04)^3 = y*(1.04)^2 \u2192 x = y*(1.04)^2/(1.04)^3 = y /1.04. \n\nWait, maybe I had that backwards. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, if the equation is x*(1.04)^3 = y*(1.04)^2, then dividing both sides by (1.04)^2 gives x*(1.04) = y. So y = x*1.04. \n\nSo substituting into x + y =5100 gives x + 1.04x = 2.04x =5100 \u2192 x =5100/2.04. \n\nYes, that's correct. 5100 divided by 2.04. Let me do the division step again. \n\nLet me write 5100 \u00f7 2.04. \n\nLet me convert 2.04 into a fraction. 2.04 = 204/100. So dividing by 204/100 is the same as multiplying by 100/204. \n\nSo 5100 * (100/204) = (5100/204)*100. \n\nCompute 5100 divided by 204. Let's see:\n\n204 * 25 = 5100. Because 200*25=5000, 4*25=100 \u2192 5000+100=5100. \n\nSo 5100/204 =25. Then multiply by 100 gives 25*100 =2500. So yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, Mohan's share is 2500. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me check again the problem's wording. The question is asking for Mohan's share. Since Mohan is the one who is younger (23), he has a shorter time? Wait, no, wait, he's getting the money now, so the older son (Sohan is 24) will have less time (2 years) for his investment. \n\nWait, so the one with the longer time (Mohan) would need a smaller initial amount because it has more time to grow. Because if you have more time, a smaller principal can grow to the same amount as a larger one with less time. \n\nSo in the equation, since Mohan's money is invested for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2, then Mohan's share (x) must be less than Sohan's (y). \n\nWait, but according to our calculation, x is 2500 and y is 2600, so that's correct. 2500 is less than 2600, which makes sense because Mohan's money has more time to grow. \n\nSo 2500*(1.04)^3 should equal 2600*(1.04)^2. Let me check that. \n\nCalculating both:\n\nFirst, compute (1.04)^2 = 1.0816. \n\nSo Sohan's amount after 2 years: 2600 *1.0816 = let's see, 2600 *1.0816. \n\n2600 *1 =2600, 2600*0.08=208, 2600*0.0016=4.16. Adding those: 2600 + 208 =2808 +4.16=2812.16. \n\nNow Mohan's amount after 3 years: 2500*(1.04)^3. \n\n(1.04)^3 =1.124864 (since 1.04*1.04=1.0816, then *1.04 again: 1.0816*1.04. Let me compute that: 1.0816*1=1.0816, 1.0816*0.04=0.043264. Sum: 1.0816+0.043264=1.124864). \n\n2500 *1.124864 = 2500*1.124864. Let's compute:\n\n2500 *1 =2500, 2500*0.124864. \n\n0.124864 *2500: 0.1*2500=250; 0.024864*2500= 62.16. So total is 250 +62.16 =312.16. \n\nSo total is 2500 +312.16 =2812.16. \n\nSo both amounts are equal, which checks out. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)2500. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 2500, so that's the right choice. I don't see any mistakes here. The answer must be B.\n",

Wait, but then y would be 2500 *1.04 = 2600. \n\nWait, but then x + y would be 2500 + 2600 = 5100, which matches the total. \n\nSo Mohan's share is 2500, which is option B. \n\nWait, but let me confirm again. The problem says Mohan is 23, so he has 3 years, and Sohan is 24, so 2 years. The equation setup was correct. \n\nLet me check the calculation again. \n\nx*(1.04)^3 = y*(1.04)^2 \u2192 x = y*(1.04)^2/(1.04)^3 = y /1.04. \n\nWait, maybe I had that backwards. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, if the equation is x*(1.04)^3 = y*(1.04)^2, then dividing both sides by (1.04)^2 gives x*(1.04) = y. So y = x*1.04. \n\nSo substituting into x + y =5100 gives x + 1.04x = 2.04x =5100 \u2192 x =5100/2.04. \n\nYes, that's correct. 5100 divided by 2.04. Let me do the division step again. \n\nLet me write 5100 \u00f7 2.04. \n\nLet me convert 2.04 into a fraction. 2.04 = 204/100. So dividing by 204/100 is the same as multiplying by 100/204. \n\nSo 5100 * (100/204) = (5100/204)*100. \n\nCompute 5100 divided by 204. Let's see:\n\n204 * 25 = 5100. Because 200*25=5000, 4*25=100 \u2192 5000+100=5100. \n\nSo 5100/204 =25. Then multiply by 100 gives 25*100 =2500. So yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, Mohan's share is 2500. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me check again the problem's wording. The question is asking for Mohan's share. Since Mohan is the one who is younger (23), he has a shorter time? Wait, no, wait, he's getting the money now, so the older son (Sohan is 24) will have less time (2 years) for his investment. \n\nWait, so the one with the longer time (Mohan) would need a smaller initial amount because it has more time to grow. Because if you have more time, a smaller principal can grow to the same amount as a larger one with less time. \n\nSo in the equation, since Mohan's money is invested for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2, then Mohan's share (x) must be less than Sohan's (y). \n\nWait, but according to our calculation, x is 2500 and y is 2600, so that's correct. 2500 is less than 2600, which makes sense because Mohan's money has more time to grow. \n\nSo 2500*(1.04)^3 should equal 2600*(1.04)^2. Let me check that. \n\nCalculating both:\n\nFirst, compute (1.04)^2 = 1.0816. \n\nSo Sohan's amount after 2 years: 2600 *1.0816 = let's see, 2600 *1.0816. \n\n2600 *1 =2600, 2600*0.08=208, 2600*0.0016=4.16. Adding those: 2600 + 208 =2808 +4.16=2812.16. \n\nNow Mohan's amount after 3 years: 2500*(1.04)^3. \n\n(1.04)^3 =1.124864 (since 1.04*1.04=1.0816, then *1.04 again: 1.0816*1.04. Let me compute that: 1.0816*1=1.0816, 1.0816*0.04=0.043264. Sum: 1.0816+0.043264=1.124864). \n\n2500 *1.124864 = 2500*1.124864. Let's compute:\n\n2500 *1 =2500, 2500*0.124864. \n\n0.124864 *2500: 0.1*2500=250; 0.024864*2500= 62.16. So total is 250 +62.16 =312.16. \n\nSo total is 2500 +312.16 =2812.16. \n\nSo both amounts are equal, which checks out. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)2500. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 2500, so that's the right choice. I don't see any mistakes here. The answer must be B.\n\n\nThe father divides Rs. 5100 between Mohan (23 years old) and Sohan (24 years old) such that their shares, when invested at 4% compound interest, will be equal when they turn 26. Mohan's share will grow for 3 years (26 - 23), and Sohan's for 2 years (26 - 24). \n\nLet Mohan's share be \\( x \\) and Sohan's be \\( y \\). The equation for their future amounts is:\n\\[\nx(1 + 0.04)^3 = y(1 + 0.04)^2\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\nx \\times 1.04 = y \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad y = 1.04x\n\\]\nThe total amount is:\n\\[\nx + y = 5100 \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x + 1.04x = 2.04x = 5100\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\nVerification confirms that both shares grow to the same amount. Thus, Mohan's share is **2500**.\n\nAnswer: B",
