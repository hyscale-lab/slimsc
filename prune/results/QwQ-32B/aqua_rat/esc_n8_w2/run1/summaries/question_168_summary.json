      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so there's this problem about two ants moving towards each other. Let me see. Ant A is going 9 cm per hour, and Ant B is 6 cm per hour. The distance between their farms is 75 cm. The question is asking how far Ant A travels until they meet. Hmm, right, this is a classic relative speed problem.\n\nFirst, I remember that when two objects are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So the total speed at which they're approaching each other is 9 + 6 = 15 cm per hour. The total distance is 75 cm. So the time it takes for them to meet should be the distance divided by their combined speed. Let me calculate that. Time = 75 / 15 = 5 hours. Wait, that makes sense because 15 times 5 is 75. \n\nNow, to find out how far Ant A traveled in that time, I just multiply Ant A's speed by the time. So 9 cm/h * 5 hours = 45 cm. Wait, but let me check the options. Option A is 45. But wait, I feel like maybe I'm missing something here. Let me go through it again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the ratio of their speeds. Since they start at the same time and move towards each other, the distance each covers until meeting should be proportional to their speeds. The ratio of A's speed to the total speed is 9/(9+6) = 9/15 = 3/5. So the distance A covers would be 3/5 of the total distance. 3/5 of 75 cm is (3/5)*75 = 45. Yeah, that's the same as before. So that's 45 cm, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, the options have A as 45, but I recall sometimes these problems might have a trick. Let me check once more. The total distance is 75, so when they meet, the sum of the distances they've traveled should equal 75. If Ant A went 45, then Ant B would have gone 30 (since 6*5=30), and 45+30 is 75. That adds up. So that's correct. So the answer must be A)45. Hmm, but why do I have a nagging feeling? Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The approach is right: combined speed gives time, then distance for A. Yep, that's standard. So yeah, 45 is the right answer. The options list A as 45, so that's the choice.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe two ants are moving towards each other with a combined speed of 9 + 6 = 15 cm/h. The time taken to meet is the total distance divided by their combined speed: 75 cm / 15 cm/h = 5 hours. The distance Ant A travels in this time is its speed multiplied by time: 9 cm/h * 5 h = 45 cm. This matches the calculation using the ratio of their speeds (9/15 of the total distance), which also gives 45 cm. The sum of distances traveled by both ants (45 + 30 = 75 cm) confirms the result is consistent.\n\nAnswer: A",

So the total distance is divided in the ratio 3:2. So 75 divided into 5 parts (3+2). Each part is 15. So Ant A would have 3 parts, which is 45. Yep, same answer. That confirms it. \n\nI think that's solid. Both methods give the same result. So the correct answer must be A)45.\n",
