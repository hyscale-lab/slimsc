      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about figuring out my brother's current age based on the information given. Hmm. So when I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I'm 60. I need to find out how old my brother is now.\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. First, when I was 2, my brother was half my age. Half of 2 is 1, so that means my brother was 1 year old at that time. So the age difference between me and my brother is 2 minus 1, which is 1 year. Wait, wait. Wait, if I was 2 and he was half my age, then he was 1. So the age difference is 1 year. That would mean he's one year younger than me? Because when I was 2, he was 1, so yes, he's a year younger.\n\nSo now, if I'm 60, then my brother should be 60 minus 1, which is 59. So the answer would be A)59? But wait, let me check again. Because sometimes these problems can be tricky with the time passing. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the age difference. Let me see. Let's set up equations. Let me denote my current age as M and my brother's current age as B. \n\nWhen I was 2, that was (current year - my age then) years ago. So the time that has passed since then is 2 years ago? Wait, no. Wait, when I was 2, that was (current age - 2) years ago. Wait, no. Let me think. If I am now 60, then the time since I was 2 is 60 - 2 = 58 years. So 58 years have passed since that time. \n\nAt that time, my brother was half my age. So when I was 2, my brother was 1. Therefore, his age then was 1. So now, 58 years later, he would be 1 + 58 = 59. That makes sense. So the answer should be 59, option A. \n\nWait, but maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Suppose the age difference is always constant. Since when I was 2, he was 1, the difference is 1 year. So now, when I'm 60, he's 59. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, could the question be trying to trick me into thinking the other way? Like maybe he's older? Wait, no. Because if when I was 2 he was half my age, then he was 1, so he's younger. So the difference is 1 year. So yes, 60 minus 1 is 59. So the answer is A)59. \n\nHmm, but looking at the options, A is 59, B is 69, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again. \n\nWait, when I was 2, my brother was half my age. So at that time, brother's age = (my age)/2 = 1. So the age difference is 2 -1 =1 year. So I am older than him by 1 year. So now, since I'm 60, he's 60-1 =59. So that's correct. So the answer must be A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that \"half my age\" now, but that's not the case. The problem states that when I was 2, he was half my age then. So the age difference is fixed. So the answer is A. \n\nHmm, maybe the options are trying to trick people into adding instead of subtracting. Like if someone thought the brother was older, they might add. But according to the problem, when the speaker was 2, the brother was 1. So the brother is younger. Therefore, the correct answer is A)59. \n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is A.\n",
