      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about percentages of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Hmm. Alright, first I need to parse the question carefully.\n\nSo all the chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored. That means there's no other flavor. So 100% total, right? The problem states that 10% are cocoa flavored. So that leaves 90% vanilla. Got that part.\n\nThen it says 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, the rest refers to what? The \"rest\" after the cocoa ones? Let me think. The first part says 10% are cocoa, so the remaining 90% are vanilla. But the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. Oh, so \"the rest\" here must be referring to the remaining after cocoa. So \"the rest\" is the 90% vanilla chocolates. Wait, but does that mean that 90% of those 90% are squashed? Or is \"the rest\" something else?\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down step by step. Let me think again. Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total to make percentages easier.\n\nTotal chocolates = 100.\n\n10% are cocoa flavored. So that's 10 chocolates cocoa, leaving 90 vanilla.\n\nNow, the next part: 90% of the rest are squashed. \"The rest\" here would be the remaining 90% (the vanilla ones?), or is it the rest after considering something else?\n\nWait, maybe the wording is tricky here. The problem says \"90% of the rest are squashed.\" The phrasing might be that after taking out the cocoa ones, the rest (the vanilla) have 90% squashed. So, of the 90 vanilla, 90% are squashed. So squashed vanilla would be 0.9 * 90 = 81. So the vanilla not squashed would be 90 - 81 = 9. So the answer would be 9%? But that's option D. But wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"the rest\" refers to the total after some other consideration. Wait, the problem says \"10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed.\" Hmm, perhaps \"the rest\" is the remaining 90% (the vanilla), so 90% of that 90% are squashed. Wait, that's what I thought before. So squashed among the vanilla would be 81, so not squashed is 9% of the total. So that would be D)9%.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me try another approach. Let me suppose there are 100 chocolates total.\n\nCocoa: 10% \u2192 10 chocolates.\n\nThe rest (90 chocolates) are vanilla. Now, 90% of the rest (the vanilla) are squashed. So squashed in vanilla: 90% of 90 = 81. So vanilla not squashed is 90 -81 =9. So 9 out of 100 are vanilla and not squashed. So the answer is D)9%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the \"rest\". Maybe \"the rest\" refers to all the chocolates except the cocoa ones, which are the vanilla ones. So yes, that seems correct. So the answer should be D. Let me check the options again. The options are A)1%, B)2%, C)5%, D)9%, E)10%.\n\nHmm. So D is 9%, which matches. But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.\n\nWait another way: The problem says \"90% of the rest are squashed\". So total squashed would be 90% of the rest. The rest is 90% of total (the vanilla). So squashed is 0.9 * 90 = 81. So total squashed chocolates would be 81 (vanilla) plus any cocoa that's squashed? Wait, does the problem mention anything about cocoa being squashed?\n\nWait the problem says \"90% of the rest are squashed\". The rest here is the non-cocoa (vanilla) chocolates, so the squashed ones are only among the vanilla? Because the way it's phrased is \"90% of the rest (vanilla) are squashed\". So cocoa ones are not part of the \"rest\", so their squashed status isn't mentioned. Wait, but maybe the problem is implying that only the rest (vanilla) can be squashed? Or maybe the squashed applies to all chocolates except cocoa?\n\nHmm, maybe I need to read the question again carefully.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"In a chocolate store, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored only. 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed. What percentage of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed?\"\n\nAh, so the first statement is that all are either vanilla or cocoa. Then, 10% are cocoa. Then, of the rest (the non-cocoa, i.e., vanilla), 90% are squashed. So the \"squashed\" applies only to the vanilla? So the cocoa ones are not considered in the squashed part. Wait, but the problem says \"90% of the rest are squashed\"\u2014so the rest is the vanilla, so 90% of those are squashed. So the squashed chocolates are 90% of the vanilla (90% of 90% total) = 81% of total. The vanilla not squashed would be 10% of the vanilla (since 90% are squashed), so 10% of 90% is 9% of total. Therefore, the answer is D)9%.\n\nYes, that seems right. So the correct answer is D. Let me check again with another example.\n\nSuppose total is 100:\n\nCocoa: 10.\n\nVanilla: 90.\n\nOf those 90 vanilla, 90% are squashed: 81 squashed vanilla. So vanilla not squashed is 9. So 9/100 =9% \u2192 D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is tricking me into thinking that the \"rest\" after cocoa and then after squashed? But no, the wording is \"10% are cocoa, 90% of the rest are squashed\". The rest here is the remaining 90% (vanilla), so the squashed is 90% of that. So I think that's correct. Therefore, the answer is D.\n",
