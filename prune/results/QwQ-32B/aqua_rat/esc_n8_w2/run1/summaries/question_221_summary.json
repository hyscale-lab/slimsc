      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here where two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. When 9 is subtracted from each, their new ratio becomes 12:23. I need to find the smaller number. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think setting up variables properly is key here.\n\nSo the original ratio is 3:5. Let me call the two numbers 3x and 5x. That way, their ratio is maintained because 3x/5x simplifies to 3/5. The actual numbers would be multiples of 3 and 5, right? The smaller number is 3x, so whatever x is, that's the one we need to find.\n\nNow, when 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers become (3x - 9) and (5x -9). The problem states that this new pair is in the ratio 12:23. So I can set up a proportion here. The ratio after subtraction is (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. \n\nLet me write that equation down properly. \n\n(3x - 9) / (5x -9) = 12/23\n\nTo solve for x, cross-multiplying should work. So multiply both sides by (5x -9) and 23 to eliminate the denominators. \n\n23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9)\n\nLet me compute each side step by step. \n\nLeft side: 23*3x is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. So 69x -207.\n\nRight side: 12*5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So 60x -108.\n\nNow the equation becomes:\n\n69x -207 = 60x -108\n\nHmm, subtract 60x from both sides: 9x -207 = -108\n\nThen add 207 to both sides: 9x = 99\n\nDivide both sides by 9: x = 11.\n\nWait, so x is 11. Then the original numbers are 3x = 33 and 5x = 55. But wait, the options don't have 55. Wait, the options are A)21, B)33, C)35, D)42, E)58. The smaller number would be 33, which is option B. But let me check again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait a second, let me verify the calculation again. Let me re-calculate the cross-multiplication step.\n\nOriginal equation after cross-multiplying:\n\n23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9)\n\n23*3x is 69x, 23*(-9)= -207. 12*5x is 60x, 12*(-9)= -108. \n\nSo 69x -207 = 60x -108. \n\nSubtract 60x from both sides: 9x -207 = -108. \n\nAdding 207 to both sides gives 9x = 99, so x=11. That's correct. \n\nSo the original numbers are 3*11=33 and 5*11=55. Then subtract 9 from each:\n\n33-9=24 and 55-9=46. \n\nNow, the ratio of 24 to 46. Let's simplify that. Dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives 12/23. Which matches the given ratio. So that checks out. \n\nTherefore the smaller original number is 33, which is option B. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option B is 33. The options do include that. So that's the answer? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in setting up the variables. Let me think again. \n\nThe problem says \"the smaller number is\". Since the original ratio is 3:5, the smaller number is indeed the 3x part, so 33. So B is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if I misread the question. Like, maybe when they subtract 9, the ratio is new numbers 12:23. Which we did. So yes, seems correct. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is B)33.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so there's this ratio problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. When 9 is subtracted from each, their new ratio becomes 12:23. We need to find the smaller number from the options given.\n\nHmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky. Let me start by recalling that when numbers are in a ratio, we can represent them as multiples of the ratio's parts. Like, if the ratio is 3:5, then the actual numbers could be 3 times some common factor and 5 times that same factor. Let me call that common factor 'k'. So the numbers would be 3k and 5k. That makes sense because 3k/5k simplifies to 3/5, which is the original ratio.\n\nNow, the problem states that when 9 is subtracted from each number, the new ratio becomes 12:23. So after subtracting 9, the numbers become (3k - 9) and (5k - 9). The ratio of these new numbers is (3k-9)/(5k-9) = 12/23. \n\nAlright, so I can set up that equation and solve for k. Let's write that out:\n\n(3k - 9)/(5k - 9) = 12/23\n\nTo solve for k, cross-multiplying should work. So:\n\n23*(3k - 9) = 12*(5k - 9)\n\nLet me compute both sides. \n\nLeft side: 23*3k is 69k, and 23*(-9) is -207. So 69k - 207.\n\nRight side: 12*5k is 60k, and 12*(-9) is -108. So 60k - 108.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n69k - 207 = 60k - 108\n\nNow, subtract 60k from both sides:\n\n9k - 207 = -108\n\nThen add 207 to both sides:\n\n9k = -108 + 207\n\nHmm, -108 plus 207. Let me calculate that. 207 minus 108 is 99. So 9k = 99.\n\nDivide both sides by 9: k = 11.\n\nSo the original numbers are 3k and 5k. Let's compute those. \n\n3*11 is 33, and 5*11 is 55. Wait, but the options don't have 55. Wait the options are A)21, B)33, C)35, D)42, E)58. Oh right, the question asks for the smaller number. So 33 is the smaller one. So that would be option B.\n\nWait a second, let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify the second part. If we subtract 9 from each number:\n\n33 -9 = 24, and 55 -9 =46. Then the ratio of 24:46. Let's simplify that. Dividing numerator and denominator by 2 gives 12:23. Perfect, that matches the given ratio. So that seems correct.\n\nWait but hold on, the options have B as 33. So the answer should be B. But let me check if I made any calculation errors.\n\nLet me recheck the cross-multiplication step. The equation was (3k-9)/(5k-9) =12/23.\n\nCross multiply: 23*(3k-9) =12*(5k-9). \n\nYes, 23*3k is 69k, 23*(-9)= -207, 12*5k=60k, 12*(-9)= -108. So equation becomes 69k-207 =60k-108. Subtract 60k: 9k-207 = -108. Adding 207: 9k=99 \u2192 k=11. Yep, that's right.\n\nTherefore the numbers are 33 and 55. The smaller is 33, which is option B. So the answer must be B)33. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options again. Wait the options include 21, which is smaller than 33. Let me see if I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Did I misinterpret the ratio? Let me read again.\n\nOriginal ratio is 3:5. After subtracting 9 from each, the new ratio is 12:23. So (3k-9)/(5k-9) = 12/23. That's correct. So I think my steps are okay. Then why is 21 an option? Maybe I made a miscalculation in solving?\n\nLet me check again the algebra step:\n\nStarting with 69k - 207 = 60k -108\n\nSubtract 60k from both sides: 9k -207 = -108\n\nAdding 207 to both sides: 9k = -108 +207 \u2192 99. So 9k=99 \u2192k=11. That's correct.\n\nHmm, so maybe the answer is B)33. The options given include 33 as B, so that's the right choice. The other options must be there to trick if someone miscalculates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross-multiplication. Let me try plugging in the answer choices to see.\n\nSuppose the smaller number is 21 (option A). Then the original numbers would be 21 and 35 (since 21:35 simplifies to 3:5). Then subtract 9: 12 and 26. The ratio of 12:26 simplifies to 6:13, which is not 12:23. So that's wrong.\n\nIf the smaller is 33 (option B), original numbers 33 and 55. Subtract 9 gives 24 and 46. 24/46 simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 2 \u219212/23. Exactly the ratio given. So that works.\n\nOption C is 35. Wait 35 would be the larger number in the original ratio. Since 3:5 ratio, the smaller is 3 parts. So 35 can't be the smaller. So C is invalid for the question's \"smaller number\".\n\nD is 42. Let's see: if the smaller is 42, then the original numbers would be 42 and 70 (since 42/70 is 3/5). Subtract 9 gives 33 and 61. 33/61 is not 12/23. 12/23 is approximately 0.5217, while 33/61 is about 0.5409. Not the same.\n\nE)58: That would be even bigger.
