      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. Hmm, the problem is about average wages over a 15-day period. The average is $90 per day. So first, I should calculate the total wages for the 15 days. Since average is total divided by number of days, the total would be 15 times 90. Let me write that down: total wages = 15 * 90 = 1350 dollars.\n\nNow, the problem says that during the first 7 days, the average was $87. So the total for those first seven days is 7 * 87. Let me calculate that. 7 times 80 is 560, plus 7*7 is 49, so total 560+49=609 dollars.\n\nThen, the last 7 days had an average of $92. So that's 7*92. Let me see, 7*90 is 630, plus 7*2 is 14, so 630+14=644 dollars.\n\nWait, so the first 7 days plus the last 7 days would be 609 + 644. Let me add those: 609+644. 600+600 is 1200, then 9+44 is 53, so total 1253. \n\nBut the total over 15 days is 1350. Wait, but if the first 7 and last 7 days add up to 1253, then the 8th day must be the remaining day. Because the 15 days consist of the first 7, the 8th day, and the last 7 days. So the total of those three parts is 1350. \n\nSo the 8th day's wage would be total (1350) minus (609 + 644) = 1350 - 1253. Let me subtract that. 1350 minus 1200 is 150, then subtract 53 more: 150 -53 = 97? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1253 from 1350: 1350 - 1253. Let me compute 1350 - 1250 first, which is 100, then subtract 3 more, so 97. Oh right, so the 8th day's wage is 97 dollars. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 97. So the answer should be D. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, let me confirm the days again. The 15 days are consecutive. The first seven days, then day 8 is the middle day, and then the last seven days would be days 9 through 15. So the total days accounted for in first 7 and last 7 is 14 days, so day 8 is the 15th day? Wait no, the total days are 15. Let me see:\n\nFirst 7 days: days 1-7. Then the last 7 days would be days 9-15? Wait, that would leave out day 8. Wait, the problem says \"the last 7 days\" of the 15-day period. So the last 7 days would be days 9 through 15, which is 7 days. So the 8th day is the one in the middle not included in either the first 7 or the last 7. So yes, the total of the first 7 plus the last 7 is 14 days, so the 8th day is the remaining day. Therefore the calculation is correct. So the answer must be D, $97.\n",

The average wage over those 15 days is $90 per day. So first, I should find the total wages for the entire fortnight. That would be 15 days multiplied by $90. Let me calculate that. 15 times 90 is 1350. So the total wages over 15 days are $1350.\n\nNow, the problem says that during the first 7 days, the average was $87. So the total for the first week is 7 times 87. Let me do that: 7*87 is 609. Then, the last 7 days had an average of $92. So that's 7*92. Let me compute that. 7*90 is 630, plus 7*2 is 14, so total 644. Wait, so the first 7 days total 609, the last 7 days 644. But wait, the total period is 15 days. So the 8th day is the middle day, right? Because the first 7 and last 7 days would overlap only if the total is 15. Let me think. The first seven days are days 1-7, the last seven days are days 9-15? Wait no, that would leave out the 8th day. Wait, actually, the problem says \"the first 7 days\" and \"the last 7 days\", so the 8th day is the day in between. So the total days accounted for in the first and last 7 days would be 7 + 7 =14 days, but since the total period is 15 days, the 8th day is the one not included in either of those averages. \n\nSo the total wages for the first 7 days plus the last 7 days plus the 8th day equals the total 15 days. Wait, actually, when they say the last 7 days, maybe that's days 9 to 15? No, that would be 7 days. Wait, the total days from first 7 and last 7 would be 14, but the 8th day is the overlapping day? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The first seven days (days 1-7) and the last seven days (days 9-15) would leave out the 8th day. But that would only be 14 days. Wait, but the problem says the last seven days. So perhaps the last seven days are days 9 through 15, which is 7 days. So the 8th day isn't part of either. Alternatively, maybe the last seven days include the 8th day? Let me see. The problem says \"the first 7 days\" and \"the last 7 days\". So in a 15-day period, the first 7 days (days 1-7), then days 8 to 14 would be the next seven, but the last seven days would be days 9-15? Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the 15 days as days 1 through 15. The first seven days are days 1-7. The last seven days would be days 9-15? No, that's 7 days, but days 9-15 is 7 days. Wait, the 8th day is the 8th, so the last seven days would be days 9 to 15 (since 15-9 +1 is 7 days). Wait, but that would leave out the 8th day. So the total of first 7 and last 7 days would be 14 days, so the 8th day is the one left. \n\nSo the total of the first 7 days plus the last 7 days plus the 8th day equals the total of all 15 days. Wait, no. Wait, the first seven plus the last seven days would be 14 days. The 8th day is the 15th day's... No, the 8th day is day 8. So the first seven days (1-7), the last seven days (9-15) and the 8th day is day 8. So adding first seven (7 days) + last seven (7 days) + day 8 (1 day) = 15 days. Wait no, that would be 7 +7 +1 = 15. So the total of the first seven plus the last seven is 14 days. So the total wages for those 14 days plus the 8th day's wage equals the total of 15 days. \n\nTherefore, if I can compute the sum of the first seven and last seven days, then subtract that from the total, I'll get the 8th day's wage. Let's see. \n\nThe total of first seven days is 7*87=609. The last seven days total is 7*92=644. So adding those together: 609 + 644 = 1253. The total of all 15 days is 1350. Therefore, the 8th day's wage is 1350 - 1253 = 97. Wait, that would be 97? Let me check the math again. \n\n609 plus 644: 600+600 is 1200, 9+44 is 53, so total 1253. 1350 minus 1253 is 97. So the answer would be D) $97. But wait, let me check the options. The options given are A)83, B)92, C)90, D)97, E)104. So D is 97, which matches. \n\nHmm, that seems right, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the days. Suppose the last seven days include the 8th day? For example, maybe the last seven days are days 9 to 15, but that would be 7 days. Wait, 15 days total. Let me count days again. Days 1-7 (7 days), days 9-15 (7 days) plus day 8. That adds to 15. So the math seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"last seven days\" includes day 8 as part of the last seven. Let me see. If the 15 days are days 1-15, then the last seven days would be days 9-15 (7 days). So the first seven days are 1-7, the last seven days 9-15. So the 8th day is the 8th day. So the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D)97. Let me check again the calculation steps. Total over 15 days is 15\u00d790=1350. First seven: 7\u00d787=609.
