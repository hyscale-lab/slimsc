      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about figuring out what percentage increase the shopkeeper needs to apply to the discounted prices to get back to the original price. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem says the shopkeeper gave a 20% discount on all items for one day. Now, the next day, he wants to sell them at the original price again. The question is, by what percentage must he increase the discounted price to bring it back to the original?\n\nHmm, right. Let me break it down. Let's assume the original price of an item is, say, $100. That might make the math easier. So if the original price is $100 and there's a 20% discount, the discounted price would be 80% of the original. Because 100 minus 20% of 100 is 80. So the discounted price is $80.\n\nNow, the next day, he wants to go back to $100. So he has to increase the $80 price back to $100. The question is, what's the percentage increase from $80 to $100?\n\nTo find the percentage increase, the formula is: ((New Price - Original Discounted Price) / Original Discounted Price) * 100. \n\nSo plugging in the numbers: (100 - 80)/80 * 100. That's 20/80 *100. Let's calculate that. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100 gives 25%. So the percentage increase needed is 25%, which would be option C.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me think of another example. Suppose the original price was $50. Then the discounted price after 20% off would be 50 * 0.8 = $40. To get back to $50 from $40, the increase needed is $10. So 10/40 is 0.25, which is 25% again. Yep, that checks out.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes percentage changes can be tricky because they're relative. The discount was 20% off the original, but the increase is based on the discounted price. So the base for the percentage is different here. So a 20% discount followed by a 25% increase brings you back. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use variables. Let the original price be P. The discounted price is 0.8P. Let the required percentage increase be x%. So, 0.8P multiplied by (1 + x/100) should equal P. \n\nSetting up the equation: 0.8P * (1 + x/100) = P. Divide both sides by 0.8P: (1 + x/100) = 1 / 0.8. 1 divided by 0.8 is 1.25. So 1 + x/100 = 1.25 \u2192 x/100 = 0.25 \u2192 x = 25. Yep, that's the same answer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C)25%.\n",

The question is asking by what percentage he must raise the discounted prices to get back to the original price. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the original price of an item is, I don't know, let's pick an example number to make it easier. Maybe $100. Because percentages are easier with 100. \n\nIf the original price is $100 and there's a 20% discount, then the discounted price would be 80% of the original. So 20% off of 100 is 20, so the discounted price is $80. Now, the next day, he wants to sell it back at the original $100. So he has to increase the $80 by some percentage to get back to $100. \n\nThe question is, what's the percentage increase from $80 to $100? \n\nPercentage increase is calculated by (New Price - Old Price)/Old Price * 100%. So here, the new price is 100, old is 80. So (100-80)/80 * 100. That's 20/80 = 0.25, so 25%. So the answer should be 25%, which is option C. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me see another way. Suppose the discount is 20%, so the new price is 80% of original. Let me call original price P. So after discount, it's 0.8P. To get back to P from 0.8P, the increase needed is P - 0.8P = 0.2P. The percentage increase relative to the discounted price is (0.2P / 0.8P)*100% = 25%. Yep, that checks out. \n\nSo the common mistake here might be thinking that since the discount was 20%, you just add 20% back, but that's not how percentages work. Because the base changes. If you take 20% of the discounted price (which is lower), then adding 20% of 80 would only get you 16, leading to 96, which isn't enough. So you need a higher percentage. \n\nSo the correct answer must be C)25%.\n",
