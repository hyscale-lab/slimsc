      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is asking for the units digit of 9 cubed minus 7. Hmm, units digit... that's the last digit of the number when it's written out. I need to figure out what 9^3 is first, subtract 7, and then see what the last digit is. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate 9^3. 9 multiplied by itself three times. Let's see, 9 times 9 is 81. Then 81 times 9. Let me compute that. 81 times 9... 80*9 is 720 and 1*9 is 9, so 720+9 is 729. So 9^3 is 729. The units digit here is 9, right? Because the last digit of 729 is 9.\n\nNow I need to subtract 7 from that number. So 729 minus 7. Let's do that subtraction. 729 minus 7 would be 722. Wait, because 729 minus 7: 9 minus 7 is 2, and the other digits stay the same? Wait, no, actually 729 minus 7 is 722. Because 729 minus 7: the units digit is 9-7=2, the tens digit remains 2, and the hundreds digit 7 stays. So 722. The units digit here would be 2. But looking at the options, D is 2. So the answer should be D?\n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way without calculating the entire number. Because sometimes with exponents, the units digit cycles in a pattern. Let me think about the units digit of 9^n.\n\nThe units digit of powers of 9 cycles every 2. For example:\n9^1 is 9 (units digit 9)\n9^2 is 81 (units digit 1)\n9^3 would be 9^2 *9, so 1*9=9 again. So the cycle is 9,1,9,1... So for exponent 3, which is odd, the units digit is 9. So 9^3 has units digit 9. Then subtracting 7, so 9 -7 is 2. But wait, but what if the number is like ...x where x is 9, subtract 7, so 9-7=2, so yes, units digit 2. So the answer would be D)2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a case where borrowing is needed? Wait, like if the number was, say, 19 minus 7 would be 12, but here 9^3 is 729. So 729 minus 7 is 722. No borrowing needed because the units digit is 9, which is larger than 7. So subtracting 7 from 9 gives 2. So the units digit is 2. So the correct answer should be D.\n\nLooking at the options, the choices are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)2, E)4. So D is indeed an option. Therefore the answer is D.\n",

Let's do that. 80 times 9 is 720, and 1 times 9 is 9, so 720 +9 is 729. So 9^3 is 729. The units digit here would be the last digit, which is 9. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 729's last digit is 9? Let me check again. 9^1 is 9 (units digit 9), 9 squared is 81 (units digit 1), 9 cubed is 9*81. Let me compute 9*81. 9*80 is 720, plus 9 is 729. Yeah, so units digit is 9. \n\nSo 9^3 has a units digit of 9. Then the problem says subtract 7. So the question is, what's 9 (the units digit of 9^3) minus 7? Wait, but units digits can't be negative, right? Hmm. Wait, actually, when you subtract, you have to consider the entire number's units digit. Wait, maybe I should compute the entire value first?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think. The units digit of (9^3 -7) would be the same as (units digit of 9^3) minus 7, but if that's negative, you have to adjust by adding 10. Let me see. So units digit of 9^3 is 9, so 9 minus 7 is 2.

Let's do that. 9^3 is 729. Subtract 7 gives 729 -7 = 722. The units digit here is 2. So that would be D. So that seems correct. But let me think again.\n\nWait another way: 9 mod 10 is 9. 9^3 mod 10: since 9 mod10 is 9, then 9^2 mod10 is (9*9) mod10 =81 mod10 =1. Then 9^3 mod10 is (9^2 *9) mod10 = (1*9) mod10 =9 mod10. So that's the same as before. Then subtract 7 mod10. Wait, so (9 -7) mod10 is 2 mod10. So units digit is 2, so D)2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is 9^(3-7) instead of 9^3 minus7? Wait, the question says 9^3 -7. Oh no, the exponent is 3, then subtract 7. So yeah, 9 cubed is 729, minus 7 is 722. Units digit 2. So the answer is D. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option C)5 and others? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. \n\nWait, 9^3 is indeed 729. 729 minus 7 is 722. The units digit is 2. So D is correct. So the answer must be D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was written differently, but according to what's given, I think that's right.
