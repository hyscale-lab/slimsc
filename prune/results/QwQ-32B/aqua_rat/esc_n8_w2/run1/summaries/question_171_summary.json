      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about figuring out the cover price per issue of a magazine when given the subscription price and the savings percentage. Hmm, so the subscription for 15 issues costs $42, and that's a 25% saving off the cover prices. I need to find the cover price per issue. \n\nAlright, let me think. If the subscription gives a 25% saving, that means the total cost of the subscription is 75% of the total cover price for all 15 issues. Because saving 25% implies you're paying 75% of the original price. Right?\n\nSo, let me denote the cover price per issue as 'x'. Then the total cover price for 15 issues would be 15 times x, which is 15x. \n\nThe subscription price is $42, which is 75% of 15x. So I can set up an equation here. Let me write that down:\n\n42 = 0.75 * (15x)\n\nBecause 25% off means you pay 75% of the original total. So solving for x would give me the cover price per issue. \n\nLet me do the math step by step. First, let's compute 15x multiplied by 0.75. Wait, actually, the equation is 42 equals 0.75 times 15x. To solve for x, I can divide both sides by 0.75 first. \n\nSo 42 divided by 0.75 equals 15x. Let me calculate 42 divided by 0.75. Hmm, 0.75 is three fourths, so dividing by that is the same as multiplying by 4/3. So 42 * (4/3) would be... 42 divided by 3 is 14, so 14 times 4 is 56. So that gives me 56 = 15x. \n\nWait, so 15x = 56. Then x is 56 divided by 15. Let me compute that. 15 times 3 is 45, subtract that from 56 gives 11. So 3 and 11/15. Let me convert that to a decimal. 11 divided by 15 is approximately 0.7333... So 3.7333... So that's about $3.7333 per issue. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest would be E) $3.73? But wait, let me check again. Because maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. \n\nWait, let me redo the division part. 42 divided by 0.75. Let me do it another way. 0.75 times 56 equals 42? Let me check: 0.75 *56. 50*0.75 is 37.5, and 6*0.75 is 4.5, so total 42. Yes, that's correct. So 15x is 56, so x is 56/15. \n\n56 divided by 15. Let me do the division precisely. 15 \u00d7 3.733333... equals 56? Let me see. 15 \u00d73 is 45, 15\u00d73.7 is 55.5, and 0.0333 \u00d715 is 0.5, so 55.5+0.5 is 56. So yes, 3.7333... So the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73, which is option E. But wait, the options given are A)$7.73, B)$6.73, C)$5.73, D)$4.73, E)$3.73. So E is the last option. \n\nWait a second, but maybe I messed up the percentage part. Let me think again. The saving is 25% of the cover prices. So the total subscription price is the total cover price minus 25% of that. So another way to put it: the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Which is exactly what I did. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that the saving is 25 percent per issue? Wait no, the question says \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". The wording is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the problem says \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". Hmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to parse that sentence again. The total subscription cost is $42, and that represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. So the saving amount is 25% of the total cover price. So the total cover price minus 25% of the total cover price equals $42. So that's the same as before. \n\nLet me represent that again. Let total cover price be T. The saving is 0.25*T, so the subscription price is T - 0.25*T = 0.75*T = 42. Therefore T is 42 /0.75 = 56. So T is the total cover price, which is 15x. So 15x =56, x is 56/15=3.7333..., so $3.73. So E is the answer. \n\nWait, but the options include E as $3.73. That seems correct. But let me check again. Maybe the question is about per issue saving? Let me re-read the question. \n\nQuestion: \"If a subscription for 15 issues of a magazine costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices, what is the cover price per issue?\"\n\nThe wording is that the total subscription cost is a saving of 25% of the cover prices. So the saving is 25% of what the total cover prices would be. So the saving is 25% of (cover price per issue *15). \n\nSo yes, the total you would pay without subscription is 15x. The saving is 0.25*(15x), so the subscription price is 15x - 0.25*15x = 0.75*15x =42. So the same equation. \n\nTherefore the answer is E. But wait, the options given have E as $3.73. That seems correct. \n\nHmm, but I feel like maybe I made a mistake because sometimes when percentages are involved, people can misinterpret. Let me check with another approach. Suppose the cover price per issue is $3.73. Then 15 issues would be 15 * 3.73. Let me calculate that. 15 *3 is 45, 15 *0.73 is 10.95, so total 55.95. The subscription is $42. So the saving is 55.95 -42 =13.95. What's 25% of 55.95? 25% is 1/4, so 55.95 /4 is 13.9875. Which is approximately 14. So the saving is about $14, which is close to 25% of the total. Since 13.95 is the actual saving, which is 13.95/55.95 \u224825%. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, if I use exact numbers: 56 total cover price (since 56/15 is exactly 3.733333...). 25% of 56 is 14, so 56-14=42. Perfect. So the exact cover price is 56/15 which is 3.7333..., so $3.73 when rounded to the nearest cent. \n\nTherefore the correct answer must be E. \n\nWait but I see the options given are A through E with E being $3.73, which matches. So I think that's correct. Maybe I was overcomplicating, but seems correct. \n\nAnother way, perhaps the test-taker might think the saving per issue is 25%, but that would be different. For example, if each issue's cover price is x, then the subscription price per issue is x - 0.25x =0.75x, so total subscription would be 15*(0.75x) =11.25x. Then 11.25x =42 \u2192 x=42/11.25 =3.733... same result. Wait, that gives the same answer. Wait, so either way, whether the total saving is 25% of total or 25% per issue, the result is the same? Because the percentage is applied uniformly across all issues. \n\nHmm, so in this case, both interpretations lead to the same equation. Because 25% off the total is same as 25% off each issue. So in that case, the calculation is the same. \n\nTherefore, I think E is correct. The answer must be E.\n",

Hmm, so the $42 is 75% of the total cover price for all 15 issues, right? Because if they saved 25%, then they're paying 75% of the original total.\n\nWait, let me think again. The saving is 25% of the cover prices. So the total without the subscription would be the sum of all individual cover prices. Let me denote the cover price per issue as 'x'. So the total regular price for 15 issues would be 15x. The subscription offers a 25% saving on that total. So the subscription cost is 75% of the regular total. \n\nSo the equation would be: 42 = (100% -25%) of 15x \u2192 42 = 0.75 * 15x. \n\nThen, solving for x: \n\nFirst, divide both sides by 0.75: 42 / 0.75 = 15x. \n\nWhat's 42 divided by 0.75? Let me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75 is the same as 42 multiplied by 4/3, right? Because 0.75 is 3/4. So 42 * (4/3) equals... 42 divided by 3 is 14, so 14 times 4 is 56. So 56 equals 15x. \n\nThen x would be 56 divided by 15. Let me do that division. 15 times 3 is 45, subtract that from 56, 11 left. 15 into 110 (adding a decimal) \u2192 15*7 is 105, so 7. So 3.733... So approximately $3.73? Wait, but the options have 3.73 as E, but let me check again.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recalculate. Wait, 42 divided by 0.75. Let me do that step again. 42 divided by 0.75. 0.75 is three quarters, so multiplying by 4/3. 42 times 4 is 168. Divided by 3 gives 56. Right, that's correct. So 56 is equal to 15x. Then x is 56/15. Let me compute 56 divided by 15. \n\n15 \u00d7 3 =45, subtract, 11. 11 divided by 15 is 0.733..., so total x is 3.733... So approximately $3.73 per issue. But looking at the options, E is 3.73, but the options also have A as 7.73. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. \n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. The question says the subscription represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me read the question again: \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". So the saving is 25% of the total cover price. \n\nSo the total cover price for 15 is 15x. The saving is 25% of that, so the subscription price is total cover price minus 25% of it. So yes, same as before. So 42 = 15x - 0.25*(15x) \u2192 42 = 0.75*(15x). So my setup was correct. \n\nSo the cover price per issue would be approximately $3.73, so option E? But wait, the options given are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. So E would be the answer. \n\nWait but let me check again. Maybe the question is per issue saving? Or perhaps I messed up the percentage. Let me try an alternative approach. Suppose the cover price per issue is x. Then the total regular price is 15x. The subscription price is $42, which is 25% less than the total regular price. So the saving is 25% of 15x, so 42 = 15x - 0.25*15x \u2192 which is the same as 0.75*15x =42. So that's correct. \n\nSo solving for x gives 56/15 \u22483.7333..., so $3.73, which is E. \n\nHmm but why is the first option so high? Maybe I messed up the problem. Let me see: if the saving is 25%, then the subscription is 75% of the total. So 42 is 75% of the total. So total regular price is 42 /0.75 =56. Then per issue is 56/15. Let me do that division again: 15 \u00d73.73 is 15 \u00d73 =45, 15 \u00d70.73=10.95, so total 55.95. Close to 56. So yes, 3.73 is correct. So the answer must be E. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is asking for the cover price per issue, which is the regular price. So yes, that would be x. So the answer is E. But why are there higher options? Let me think if maybe I inverted something. Suppose the saving is 25% per issue. Wait, the question says \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the $42 is 25% less than the cover price per issue? No, that can't be because it's for 15 issues. The question says the subscription cost is a saving of 25% of the cover prices. Hmm, perhaps the wording is tricky. Let me parse the sentence again. \n\nThe subscription for 15 issues costs $42 and represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. \n\nThe saving is 25% of the cover prices. So the total amount saved is 25% of (the total cover price). So total cover price is 15x. The saving is 0.25 *15x. Therefore, the subscription price is total cover price minus saving \u2192 15x - 0.25*15x = 0.75*15x =42. So that's the same equation again. \n\nSo the math checks out. So answer must be E. But let me check the options again. The options are A through E as listed. So yes, E is 3.73. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me verify with another approach. Suppose the cover price per issue is $3.73. Then 15 issues would normally cost 15 * 3.73 = 55.95. The saving would be 25% of that, which is 0.25*55.95 \u224813.9875. So the subscription price would be 55.95 -13.9875 \u224841.96, which is approximately $42. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, if I pick another option, say D)4.73. Let's see: 15*4.73=70.95. 25% of that is ~17.74, so subscription price would be 70.95 -17.74 =53.21, which is way higher than 42. So that can't be. \n\nSimilarly, if someone thought the saving per issue is 25% of the cover price, then the subscription price per issue would be 0.75x, so total 15*0.75x =42 \u2192 11.25x=42 \u2192 x\u22483.73 again.

So the total regular price for 15 issues would be 15x. The subscription offers a 25% saving on that total. So the subscription cost is 75% of the regular total. \n\nSo the equation would be: 42 = (100% -25%) of 15x \u2192 42 = 0.75 * 15x. \n\nThen, solving for x: \n\nFirst, divide both sides by 0.75: 42 / 0.75 = 15x. \n\nWhat's 42 divided by 0.75? Let me calculate that. 42 divided by 0.75 is the same as 42 multiplied by 4/3, right? Because 0.75 is 3/4. So 42 * (4/3) equals... 42 divided by 3 is 14, so 14 times 4 is 56. So 56 equals 15x. \n\nThen x would be 56 divided by 15. Let me do that division. 15 times 3 is 45, subtract that from 56, 11 left. 15 into 110 (adding a decimal) \u2192 15*7 is 105, so 7. So 3.733... So approximately $3.73? Wait, but the options have 3.73 as E, but let me check again.\n\nWait, wait. Let me recalculate. Wait, 42 divided by 0.75. Let me do that step again. 42 divided by 0.75. 0.75 is three quarters, so multiplying by 4/3. 42 times 4 is 168. Divided by 3 gives 56. Right, that's correct. So 56 is equal to 15x. Then x is 56/15. Let me compute 56 divided by 15. \n\n15 \u00d7 3 =45, subtract, 11. 11 divided by 15 is 0.733..., so total x is 3.733... So approximately $3.73 per issue. But looking at the options, E is 3.73, but the options also have A as 7.73. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. \n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. The question says the subscription represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify. Let me read the question again: \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". So the saving is 25% of the total cover price. \n\nSo the total cover price for 15 is 15x. The saving is 25% of that, so the subscription price is total cover price minus 25% of it. So yes, same as before. So 42 = 15x - 0.25*(15x) \u2192 42 = 0.75*(15x). So my setup was correct. \n\nSo the cover price per issue would be approximately $3.73, so option E? But wait, the options given are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. So E would be the answer. \n\nWait but let me check again. Maybe the question is per issue saving? Or perhaps I messed up the percentage. Let me try an alternative approach. Suppose the cover price per issue is x. Then the total regular price is 15x. The subscription price is $42, which is 25% less than the total regular price. So the saving is 25% of 15x, so 42 = 15x - 0.25*15x \u2192 which is the same as 0.75*15x =42. So that's correct. \n\nSo solving for x gives 56/15 \u22483.7333..., so $3.73, which is E. \n\nHmm but why is the first option so high? Maybe I messed up the problem. Let me see: if the saving is 25%, then the subscription is 75% of the total. So 42 is 75% of the total. So total regular price is 42 /0.75 =56. Then per issue is 56/15. Let me do that division again: 15 \u00d73.73 is 15 \u00d73 =45, 15 \u00d70.73=10.95, so total 55.95. Close to 56. So yes, 3.73 is correct. So the answer must be E. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is asking for the cover price per issue, which is the regular price. So yes, that would be x. So the answer is E. But why are there higher options? Let me think if maybe I inverted something. Suppose the saving is 25% per issue. Wait, the question says \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". \n\nAlternatively, maybe the $42 is 25% less than the cover price per issue? No, that can't be because it's for 15 issues. The question says the subscription cost is a saving of 25% of the cover prices. Hmm, perhaps the wording is tricky. Let me parse the sentence again. \n\nThe subscription for 15 issues costs $42 and represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. \n\nThe saving is 25% of the cover prices. So the total amount saved is 25% of (the total cover price). So total cover price is 15x. The saving is 0.25 *15x. Therefore, the subscription price is total cover price minus saving \u2192 15x - 0.25*15x = 0.75*15x =42. So that's the same equation again. \n\nSo the math checks out. So answer must be E. But let me check the options again. The options are A through E as listed. So yes, E is 3.73. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me verify with another approach. Suppose the cover price per issue is $3.73. Then 15 issues would normally cost 15 * 3.73 = 55.95. The saving would be 25% of that, which is 0.25*55.95 \u224813.9875. So the subscription price would be 55.95 -13.9875 \u224841.96, which is approximately $42. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, if I pick another option, say D)4.73. Let's see: 15*4.73=70.95. 25% of that is ~17.74, so subscription price would be 70.95 -17.74 =53.21, which is way higher than 42. So that can't be. \n\nSimilarly, if someone thought the saving per issue is 25% of the cover price, then the subscription price per issue would be 0.75x, so total 15*0.75x =42 \u2192 11.25x=42 \u2192 x\u22483.73 again. So same result. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\n\n\nThe subscription cost of $42 represents a 25% saving on the total cover price for 15 issues. Let the cover price per issue be \\( x \\). The total cover price for 15 issues is \\( 15x \\). The subscription price is 75% of this total (since it saves 25%):\n\n\\[\n42 = 0.75 \\times 15x\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n42 = 11.25x \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad x = \\frac{42}{11.25} = 3.733\\ldots\n\\]\n\nRounding to two decimal places, the cover price per issue is approximately $3.73. This matches option E.\n\nAnswer: E",
