      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children from Ranchi to Patna. The adult fare is given as Rs. 140. The child fare is half of that. Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I need to find the cost for the adults. Each adult is 140, so 4 adults would be 4 multiplied by 140. Let me calculate that. 4 times 100 is 400, and 4 times 40 is 160, so adding them gives 560. Wait, 4*140 is 560. Got that part.\n\nNow for the children. Since a child's fare is half of an adult's, that would be 140 divided by 2. That's 70. So each child's ticket is Rs.70. Then three children would be 3 times 70. Let me do that. 3*70 is 210, right?\n\nNow, adding the adults and children together. 560 plus 210. Let me add them. 560 + 200 is 760, then plus 10 more makes 770? Wait, that can't be right because one of the options is 700. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me check again. The adult fare is 140 each. 4 adults: 4\u00d7140. Let me compute that again. 140\u00d74. 100\u00d74 is 400, 40\u00d74 is 160, so 400+160=560. That's correct. Then children: 3\u00d770. 70\u00d73 is 210. So total is 560+210 = 770. Hmm, but option E is 770. But wait, let me check the options again. The options given are A)666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770. So 770 is option E. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the child's fare?\n\nWait the problem says \"child is half the fare of one adult\". So yes, half of 140 is 70. So 3 children would be 3\u00d770=210. So total 560+210 is indeed 770. But why is option C 700? Maybe I misread the numbers. Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says 4 adults and 3 children. Oh wait, maybe I added wrong. 560 plus 210: 560+200 is 760, plus 10 is 770. So that's correct. So the answer should be E)770. But let me check the options again. The options are A)666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770. So E is 770. That's the correct calculation. So why is there an option C as 700? Maybe I made a mistake in the number of children? Wait the problem says 3 children, right. So 3 times 70 is 210. Hmm, maybe I misread the number of adults and children? Wait the question says 4 adults and 3 children. Yeah, so 4\u00d7140 is 560 and 3\u00d770 is 210. Adding them gives 770. So the correct answer should be E. But the options have E as 770. So I think that's correct. Wait the options are listed as A to E, so the answer is E. Let me check again. The problem states the child's fare is half of the adult's, so that's correct. I think the answer must be E. Maybe the other options are there to trick if someone miscalculates.\n",
