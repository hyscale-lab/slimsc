      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen number from 1 to 1000 is relatively prime to 1000. Hmm, relatively prime means they share no common factors except 1. Alright, first step is probably to factorize 1000 to find its prime factors. Let's see, 1000 is 10 cubed, which is 2^3 * 5^3. So the prime factors are 2 and 5. \n\nThe problem now is to find how many numbers between 1 and 1000 don't have 2 or 5 as factors. Because if a number is relatively prime to 1000, it can't be divisible by either 2 or 5. So the probability would be the count of such numbers divided by 1000. \n\nWait, how do I calculate that? Maybe using the inclusion-exclusion principle here. The total numbers not divisible by 2 or 5 would be total numbers minus those divisible by 2 or 5. \n\nAlternatively, using Euler's totient function \u03c6(n) which counts the numbers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n. Since the question is up to 1000, \u03c6(1000) would give exactly the count we need. Then the probability would be \u03c6(1000)/1000. \n\nOh right, Euler's totient function formula for n = p^a * q^b is \u03c6(n) = n*(1-1/p)*(1-1/q)... So for 1000, which factors into 2^3 and 5^3, \u03c6(1000) = 1000*(1-1/2)*(1-1/5). Let me compute that.\n\nCalculating that step by step:\nFirst, 1-1/2 is 1/2, and 1-1/5 is 4/5. Multiplying those together: (1/2)*(4/5) = 4/10 = 2/5. Then multiply by 1000: 1000 * (2/5) = 400. Wait, so \u03c6(1000) is 400? So the number of numbers coprime is 400, so the probability would be 400/1000, which simplifies to 2/5. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, option D is 2/5. But I feel like maybe I made a mistake here because I remember something else. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I did the totient function correctly. Let me recalculate:\n\n1000*(1 - 1/2) = 1000*(1/2) = 500. Then multiply by (1 - 1/5) which is 4/5. So 500 * 4/5 is 400. Yeah, that's right. So 400 numbers between 1 and 1000 are coprime with 1000. Then probability is 400/1000 = 0.4, which is 2/5, so D. But wait, the options include other fractions like 3/5, 4/7, etc. Let me see if I did something wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it using inclusion-exclusion to verify. Let's see:\n\nTotal numbers from 1 to N is 1000.\n\nNumbers divisible by 2: floor(1000/2) = 500.\n\nNumbers divisible by 5: floor(1000/5) = 200.\n\nNumbers divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 10): floor(1000/10) = 100.\n\nSo by inclusion-exclusion, numbers divisible by 2 or 5 are 500 + 200 - 100 = 600. Therefore numbers not divisible by either are 1000 - 600 = 400. Which matches the totient function result. So the probability is indeed 400/1000 = 2/5, so D.\n\nBut wait, the options given include D) 2/5, so that must be the answer. But I remember once a similar problem where the answer was different. Let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the totient function formula?\n\nWait, Euler's totient function \u03c6(n) counts numbers from 1 to n that are coprime to n, right? So for 1000, that's exactly the count we need. So yes, \u03c6(1000) = 400. So 400/1000 is 2/5. Hmm, so the answer must be D. But let me check the options again. The options are A)5/7, B)3/5, C)4/7, D)2/5, E)2/7. So D is there. So I think that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is about numbers from 1 to 999? Wait no, the question says 1 to 1000 inclusive. So 1000 is included. But 1000 is divisible by both 2 and 5, so it's excluded. So the count is correct. Yeah, so D is the right answer. I think that's it.\n",
