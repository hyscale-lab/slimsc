      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Charles invested some money, and after a year, he got $54,080, which includes both the principal and the interest. The question is asking for the original amount he invested. The interest is 8% annual, compounded semi-annually. Hmm, right, compound interest.\n\nLet me remember the formula for compound interest. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), right? Where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money).\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years.\n\nIn this problem, the time is one year, so t=1. The rate is 8%, so r=0.08. Since it's compounded semi-annually, n should be 2. The amount A is given as $54,080. We need to find P.\n\nPlugging the numbers into the formula: \n\n54,080 = P*(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1)\n\nLet me compute the parts step by step. First, 0.08 divided by 2 is 0.04. Adding 1 gives 1.04. Then the exponent is 2*1 =2. So the equation becomes:\n\n54,080 = P*(1.04)^2\n\nWait, let me calculate (1.04)^2. 1.04 times 1.04. Let me compute that. 1.04 squared is 1.0816. Because 1.04*1.04: 1*1 is 1, 1*0.04 is 0.04, 0.04*1 is 0.04, and 0.04*0.04 is 0.0016. Adding all together: 1 + 0.04 +0.04 +0.0016 = 1.0816. So yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo 54,080 equals P multiplied by 1.0816. To find P, divide both sides by 1.0816.\n\nSo P = 54,080 / 1.0816.\n\nHmm, need to calculate that. Let's see. Let me try to do the division. Maybe there's a better way. Let me see the options given. The options are A)$45k, B)$50k, C)$54k, D)$59k, E)$62k. Let me see if any of these multiplied by 1.0816 gives 54,080.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 54,080 divided by 1.0816. Let me do that step by step.\n\nAlternatively, maybe 54,080 divided by 1.0816. Let me see: 1.0816 times 50,000 would be 50,000 * 1.0816. Let's calculate that first. 50,000 *1.0816: 50,000 *1 is 50,000, plus 50,000 *0.0816. 0.08*50,000 is 4,000, and 0.0016*50,000 is 80. So total 4,000 +80=4,080. So total is 50,000 +4,080=54,080. Oh! Wait, that's exactly the amount given. So 50,000 multiplied by 1.0816 gives exactly 54,080. So that means the principal was $50,000. Which is option B.\n\nLet me confirm again. Let me check the calculation again. If P is 50,000, then after 6 months, the first compounding would be 50,000 * 1.04 (since 8% annual is 4% per half-year). So 50,000 *1.04 is 52,000. Then, the second compounding: 52,000 *1.04. Let's see, 52,000 *1.04. 52,000 + (52,000 *0.04). 52,000 *0.04 is 2,080. So adding to 52,000 gives 54,080. Exactly the amount given. So that's correct. So the answer is B, $50,000. \n\nTherefore the correct option is B.\n",
