      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about two trains leaving a station. Let me read it again. Train A leaves every 16 minutes and Train B every 17 minutes. They both just left at the same time, and I need to find out how long until they do that again. Hmm, right. The question is asking for the next time they'll leave together. \n\nI remember from math class that when you have things happening at regular intervals and you want to find when they coincide again, you need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals. Because the LCM is the smallest number that both intervals divide into. So like, for example, if one train comes every 2 minutes and another every 3, their LCM is 6, so they'd meet again at 6 minutes. \n\nSo in this case, the intervals are 16 and 17 minutes. Let me think about how to compute the LCM for those two numbers. The formula for LCM of two numbers is (a*b)/GCD(a,b), right? Where GCD is the greatest common divisor. \n\nFirst, I need to find the GCD of 16 and 17. Wait, 16 and 17 are consecutive integers. Oh, right! Consecutive integers are always coprime, meaning their GCD is 1. Because any two numbers that are next to each other can't share any common divisors except 1. Like 15 and 16: factors of 15 are 1,3,5 and 16 is 2^4. So yeah, GCD here is definitely 1. \n\nSo plugging into the formula: LCM(16,17) = (16*17)/1 = 272. So that would be 272 minutes. Let me check the options. Option A is 272. So that's probably the answer. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough. Let me think another way. Let's list the departure times for each train and see when they align again. \n\nTrain A departs at 0, 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 112, 128, 144, 160, 176, 192, 208, 224, 240, 256, 272, etc. \n\nTrain B departs at 0, 17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102, 119, 136, 153, 170, 187, 204, 221, 238, 255, 272, etc. \n\nLooking for the next common time after 0. The first common time after 0 is indeed 272. That's exactly what I calculated before. \n\nSo the answer should be A)272. Let me check the options again. The options are A through E, with A being 272. So yeah, that's correct. \n\nWait a second, but why is there an option C)190? Maybe I made a mistake. Let me see. 16 times 17 is 272, so unless there's a smaller common multiple. But 16 and 17 are coprime, so LCM is their product. So no, there can't be a smaller number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Like, if they just left together, then the next time would be the LCM. But I don't see any trick here. The problem seems straightforward. \n\nAnother way to confirm: 16 factors are 2^4, and 17 is a prime number. Since they have no common factors except 1, LCM is 16*17. Yep, so 272. So the correct answer must be A. The other options don't make sense. 304 is 16*19, but 17 doesn't divide into that. 190 is 17*11.17... no, wait 17*11 is 187, 17*12 is 204, so 190 isn't a multiple of 17. 190 divided by 17 is about 11.176, which isn't an integer. So that's not right. \n\nTherefore, the answer is definitely A.\n",
