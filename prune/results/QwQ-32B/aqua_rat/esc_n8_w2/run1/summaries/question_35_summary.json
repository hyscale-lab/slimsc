      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a rectangular solid inscribed in a sphere. The dimensions are 3 x 4 x 15, and I need to find the diameter of the sphere. Hmm, right. Let me think. \n\nFirst, when a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, that means all eight vertices of the solid touch the sphere's surface. The sphere's diameter should be equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid because the diagonal would stretch from one vertex to the opposite vertex, passing through the center of the sphere. So the length of that diagonal would be the diameter. \n\nOh right, the formula for the space diagonal of a rectangular prism is sqrt(length\u00b2 + width\u00b2 + height\u00b2). Let me recall that. So the dimensions here are 3, 4, and 15. Let me plug those numbers into the formula. \n\nCalculating each term: 3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, and 15 squared is 225. Adding those up: 9 + 16 is 25, plus 225 gives 250. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 9 plus 16 is 25? Oh, yes, but 25 plus 225 would be 250? Hmm, okay. So the space diagonal would be the square root of 250. \n\nWait, sqrt(250)... Let me compute that. The square of 15 is 225 and 16 squared is 256. So sqrt(250) is between 15 and 16. Let's see. 15.8 squared is 249.64, because 15 squared is 225, plus 0.8 squared is 0.64, but wait, actually, (15.8)^2 = (15 + 0.8)^2 = 15^2 + 2*15*0.8 + 0.8^2 = 225 + 24 + 0.64 = 249.64. Oh, so that's really close to 250. So sqrt(250) is approximately 15.8113... Wait, so that would be option B? Let me check the options again. \n\nThe options are A) 13.3542, B)15.8113, C)18.3451, D)19.5667, E)20.8888. \n\nHmm, so if the space diagonal is sqrt(3\u00b2 + 4\u00b2 +15\u00b2) = sqrt(9+16+225)= sqrt(250). The square root of 250 is indeed approximately 15.8114, so option B. \n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate:\n\n3 squared is 9, 4 squared is 16, 15 squared is 225. Adding them: 9+16 =25, then 25 +225 =250. Yes, that's correct. So the space diagonal is sqrt(250). \n\nAlternatively, sqrt(250) can be simplified as sqrt(25*10) which is 5*sqrt(10). Since sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623, so 5*3.1623 is 15.8115. That matches with the option B. \n\nSo the diameter of the sphere must be equal to that diagonal, so the answer should be B. Let me check the options again. Yep, B is 15.8113. That seems right. \n\nI don't see any other approach here. The key idea is recognizing that the sphere's diameter is the space diagonal. Maybe someone might think of the diameter as one of the sides, but since the solid is 3x4x15, the longest edge is 15, but the diagonal would be longer than that. Wait, but 15.8 is just a bit longer than 15. But the other options like C is 18, which is way bigger. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, wait, wait. Wait, hold on. Wait, the formula for the space diagonal is correct? Let me think again. For a rectangular prism with length l, width w, height h, the space diagonal d is sqrt(l\u00b2 + w\u00b2 + h\u00b2). Yes, that's the formula. So 3,4,15. So sqrt(9+16+225)=sqrt(250). So that's correct. \n\nHmm, but maybe I misread the dimensions? The problem says 3 x4 x15. Yeah. So 3,4,15. So that's correct. So sqrt(250) is indeed the diagonal. So the answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculation? Let me compute sqrt(250) again. Let's see:\n\n15 squared is 225, 16 squared is 256. So sqrt(250) is between 15.8 and 15.81. Let me compute 15.81 squared:\n\n15.81 *15.81. Let's see:\n\n15 *15 =225. 15 *0.81 =12.15, 0.81*15=12.15, and 0.81*0.81=0.6561. So expanding (15 + 0.81)^2 = 15\u00b2 + 2*15*0.81 +0.81\u00b2 =225 + 24.3 +0.6561 = 225 +24.3 is 249.3, plus 0.6561 gives 249.9561. Which is very close to 250. So 15.81 squared is about 249.956, so sqrt(250) is approximately 15.8114, which matches option B exactly. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be B. I think that's solid. The other options are either too small (like A is 13, which is less than the space diagonal, but the diagonal has to be longer than the longest edge, which is 15. So B is the only one between 15 and 16. The others are way bigger. So I think I'm confident here.\n",
