      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is asking how many ways the letters of the word \"PROBLEC\" can be rearranged into 7-letter words where none of the letters repeat. The options are given as A through E, with C being 7! and D 8! and so on. Let me think.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there are any repeating letters in the word \"PROBLEC\". Let me write them out: P, R, O, B, L, E, C. Wait, that's seven letters. Let me count again. P-R-O-B-L-E-C. Each letter is unique, right? Like, no duplicates. So all seven letters are distinct. \n\nIf all the letters are different, then the number of possible rearrangements (permutations) should just be 7 factorial, which is 7! So that would be 7\u00d76\u00d75\u00d74\u00d73\u00d72\u00d71. That's 5040. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 7! So that's probably the answer. But wait, the question says \"such that none of the letters repeat\". Hmm, but since all letters are already unique, any rearrangement would naturally not have repeating letters. So the total permutations would indeed be 7!.\n\nLet me double-check the word again. PROBLEC. Let's see: P, R, O, B, L, E, C. Seven distinct letters. So yeah, no repetition. So the answer should be 7! which is option C. The other options don't make sense here. Like 8! would be if there were 8 letters, but here it's 7. The options A and B are way too small. So the correct answer must be C.\n",

That's seven letters total. Wait, are there any repeating letters here? Let me check each letter. P appears once, R once, O once, B once, L once, E once, C once. Oh right, all letters are unique.

But since the word has exactly 7 letters, all unique, the correct answer must be 7!.\n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no trick here. The question says \"none of the letters repeat\". Since all letters are already unique, any permutation would automatically satisfy that condition. So there's no restriction here beyond just rearranging all letters.
