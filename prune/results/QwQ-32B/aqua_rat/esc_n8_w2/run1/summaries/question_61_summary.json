      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have to figure out the total number of students in the class based on the percentages given and the remaining students not interested in any games. Hmm, the problem says that 8% are into Football, 4/5 in Cricket, 10% in Basketball, and then there's 20 students left who aren't interested in any. \n\nFirst, I should convert all these into percentages or fractions so they can add up properly. Let me start by converting everything to percentages. \n\nThe Cricket part is 4/5 of the total students. Since 4/5 is equal to 80%, right? Because 4 divided by 5 is 0.8. So Cricket is 80%. Football is 8%, Basketball is 10%. Adding those up: 80 + 8 + 10. Let me calculate that: 80 plus 8 is 88, plus 10 makes 98. So altogether, 98% of the students are interested in at least one of those sports. \n\nBut then the remaining students, which are 20, are not interested in any. So that remaining percentage must be 100% minus 98%, which is 2%. So 2% of the total students equals 20 students. \n\nWait, right. So if 2% corresponds to 20 students, then the total number of students would be 20 divided by 0.02. Let me do that calculation. 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 multiplied by 50, because 1/0.02 is 50. So 20*50 is 1000. Wait, but 1000 is one of the options, option E. Hmm, but let me check again because sometimes I might have messed up the percentages.\n\nLet me verify step by step again. \n\nFootball: 8%, Cricket 4/5 (which is 80%), Basketball 10%. Adding those percentages: 8 + 80 is 88, plus 10 is 98. So total interested is 98%, so 2% are not interested. The 20 students are 2% of total. So total students = 20 / 0.02 = 1000. That's straightforward. So the answer should be E)1000?\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)850, B)800, C)900, D)950, E)1000. So E is 1000. But maybe I made an error in adding the percentages. Let me check again. 8% + 80% is 88%, plus 10% gives 98%. Yeah that's correct. So remaining is 2%, which is 20. So 2% of total is 20. So total is 20 / 0.02 = 1000. \n\nHmm, but wait, the problem says \"remaining 20 students are not interested in any games.\" So that should be correct. Unless there's some overlap between the sports? Like, maybe some students are interested in more than one sport, so the total percentages could be over 100? Wait, but the question says \"interested in Football\", \"interested in Cricket\", etc. So perhaps the way the question is phrased, each percentage is the number of students interested in that particular sport, possibly overlapping. But when adding up the percentages, maybe that's not the right approach because some students might be counted in multiple categories. \n\nOh! Wait a second, that's a possible mistake here. The problem states the percentages for each sport, but if students can be interested in more than one sport, then adding them up would overcount. However, the problem might be assuming that the categories are exclusive. But the question says \"remaining 20 students are not interested in any games\"\u2014so perhaps the total interested in at least one of the sports is the sum of each percentage. But that's only possible if there's no overlap. \n\nHmm, the problem doesn't mention anything about overlapping interests. Since the problem gives the total percentages and the remaining students, maybe it's intended that the percentages are non-overlapping. So maybe the question assumes that each student is interested in at most one sport, so the total percentage interested in any of the sports is the sum. So then the 2% is correct. \n\nAlternatively, if there's overlap, then the total percentage could be more than 100, but since we have only 100%, perhaps the question expects us to just add them up. \n\nTherefore, under the assumption that the percentages are non-overlapping, the answer would be 1000. So the correct option is E. \n\nBut let me check again. Let me think of another approach. Let the total number of students be x. Then:\n\nFootball: 0.08x\n\nCricket: (4/5)x = 0.8x\n\nBasketball: 0.10x\n\nThe sum of these is 0.08x + 0.8x +0.10x = 0.98x. \n\nThe remaining students not interested are x - 0.98x = 0.02x, which equals 20. \n\nSo 0.02x =20 \u2192 x=20 /0.02 = 1000. \n\nYes, so that's the calculation. So the answer must be E. \n\nHmm, but why are the other options there? Like 900 or 800? Let me see if I made a calculation mistake. \n\nWait, 20 divided by 0.02: 0.02 times 1000 is 20. Yes. So that's correct. So the answer is E.\n",

So that 2% corresponds to 20 students. To find the total number of students, let me call the total students T. So 2% of T equals 20. \n\nMathematically, that's 0.02 * T = 20. To solve for T, divide both sides by 0.02. So T = 20 / 0.02. Let me compute that. 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 multiplied by 50 (since 1/0.02 is 50). 20 *50 is 1000. Wait, but 1000 is one of the options, option E. But wait, let me double-check. \n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I added the percentages correctly. Football 8%, Cricket 80%, Basketball 10%. Adding those gives 8+80 is 88, plus 10 is 98. So yeah, 98% are interested in at least one of those sports, so 2% are not. That 2% is 20 students. So total students would be 20 /0.02 = 1000.

Yeah, that's correct. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 1000. But let me check the other options to see if any of them could work. Suppose the total was 800. Then 2% would be 16 students, which isn't 20. 900 would give 18, still not 20. 850 would be 17. So only 1000 gives exactly 20.
