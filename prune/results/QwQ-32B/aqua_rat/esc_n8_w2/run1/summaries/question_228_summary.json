      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about combinations. We have a box with balls numbered from 1 to n, and we need to find n such that the number of ways to choose two balls without selecting the one numbered 3 is 45. Hmm.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to choose any two balls from n would be C(n, 2). But since we can't select ball 3, we have to subtract the cases where ball 3 is included. Wait, no, maybe another way. If ball 3 isn't selected, then we're actually choosing both balls from the remaining (n-1) balls. Because if we exclude ball 3, there are n-1 balls left. So the number of ways should be C(n-1, 2). And this is given as 45.\n\nSo the equation is C(n-1, 2) = 45. Let me write that out. The combination formula is C(k,2) = k(k-1)/2. So substituting:\n\n(n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45. Multiply both sides by 2: (n-1)(n-2) = 90.\n\nNow I need to solve for n here. Let's expand the left side: (n-1)(n-2) = n\u00b2 - 3n + 2 = 90. So n\u00b2 -3n +2 -90=0 \u2192 n\u00b2-3n -88=0.\n\nHmm, solving quadratic equation: n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2. Because discriminant is 9 + 4*88 = 9+352=361. Square root of 361 is 19. So n = [3 +19]/2 = 22/2 =11, and the other solution is negative, so we ignore that. So n would be 11. Let me check the options. Option A is 11. But wait, let me verify again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The problem says the number of ways where 3 is NOT selected. So total ways without any restriction is C(n,2). The number of ways where 3 is selected would be C(n-1,1), because if 3 is selected, the other ball is any of the remaining n-1. So the number of ways not selecting 3 is total minus those: C(n,2) - (n-1) = 45. Let me see if this approach gives the same answer.\n\nLet's compute that: C(n,2) - (n-1) = [n(n-1)/2] - (n-1) = (n-1)(n/2 -1) = (n-1)(n -2)/2. Oh, same as before. So the equation is indeed (n-1)(n-2)/2 =45. So the first approach was correct. So solving gives n=11. But let me check the options again. Option A is 11, which would be correct. Wait, but let me check with the options given. The options are A)11, B)10 etc. So that would be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me compute (n-1)(n-2) =90. Let me try plugging in the options. Let's see:\n\nIf n=10, then (10-1)(10-2)=9*8=72, which is less than 90. Not enough.\n\nn=11: 10*9=90. Yes. So that's correct. So the answer is A)11. Hmm. But wait, the options have A as 11. So that's the answer. I think that's right. Let me just confirm again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I confused the setup. Suppose the problem had said \"the number of ways where 3 is selected\", but no, the question is the opposite. So yes, the correct answer is 11. So the answer is A.\n",

We need to find n such that the number of ways to choose two balls without selecting the one numbered 3 is 45. Hmm.\n\nAlright, so first, the total number of ways to choose any two balls from n would be the combination C(n, 2). But we have a condition here: the ball numbered 3 must not be selected. So we need to subtract the combinations that include ball 3.\n\nWait, maybe another way: If we can't choose ball 3, then effectively we're choosing two balls from the remaining (n-1) balls. Because there are n total, and excluding the number 3, so the number of balls available is n minus 1. So the number of ways would be C(n-1, 2). And that's equal to 45.\n\nOh right, that's probably the right approach. Because if you exclude one specific ball (number 3 here), then the problem reduces to choosing two from the rest. So the formula would be (n-1 choose 2) = 45.\n\nLet me write that equation out:\n\nC(n-1, 2) = 45.\n\nThe combination formula for C(k, 2) is k(k-1)/2.

Let's see, the quadratic formula would be n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2. Since 352 is 8*44, but sqrt(361) is 19. Wait, 9+352 is 361. Oh right, sqrt(361)=19. So:\n\nn = [3 +19]/2 = 22/2=11, or [3-19]/2 which is negative. Since n can't be negative, so n is 11. So the answer is A)11?\n\nWait, but let me check. Let me verify the calculation again. Let me compute (n-1)(n-2)=90. Let's test n=11: (10)(9)=90. Yes that's exactly 90. So that works. So the answer is 11, which is option A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. The problem says the number of ways where the ball 3 is NOT selected. So total ways without any restriction is C(n,2), and the number of ways that do include ball 3 would be C(n-1,1), since you have to pick one more ball along with 3. Therefore, the number of ways not selecting 3 would be total minus those: C(n,2) - (n-1) = 45. Wait, but that should also give the same answer. Let me check:\n\nLet me try that approach. Let me see:\n\nTotal combinations: C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2.\n\nCombinations that include ball 3: If you must include ball 3, then the other ball can be any of the remaining (n-1) balls, so that's (n-1) combinations.\n\nSo the number of ways not including 3 is total minus those: [n(n-1)/2] - (n-1) = 45.\n\nLet me factor out (n-1):\n\n(n-1)[n/2 -1] =45.\n\nHmm, let's compute this:\n\n(n-1)( (n - 2)/2 ) =45 \u2192 (n-1)(n-2)/2 =45. Which is exactly the same equation as before. So that gives the same equation. So that approach is consistent. So solving that gives n=11 again. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be A)11. Let me check the options again. The options are A)11, B)10 etc. So yes, A is the first option. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I can check with the other options. Let's say if n was 10, then (10-1)*(10-2) = 9*8=72, which divided by 2 gives 36, which is less than 45. So that's not. For n=11, 10*9=90, divided by 2 is 45. So that's exactly the required.
