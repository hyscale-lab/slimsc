      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out what the value of log base 2 of 4 is. Hmm, let me remember what logarithms are. A logarithm log_b a answers the question: To what power do we need to raise b to get a? So here, log2 4 means, 2 raised to what exponent gives 4?\n\nLet me think. 2 to the first power is 2. 2 squared is 4. Oh right! So 2^2 equals 4. That means the exponent needed is 2. So the answer should be 2, which is option A. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The options are A)2, B)4... yeah, so A is the first option. I think that's correct. Let me double-check. If I take log base 2 of 4, then yes, 2 multiplied by itself twice (2*2) is 4. So the logarithm here is definitely 2. So the answer must be A.\n",
