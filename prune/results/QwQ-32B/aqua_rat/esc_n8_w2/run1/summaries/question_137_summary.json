      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a coin-diver who gets paid 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. After one dive, she made $3.40. We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up. The options are from A to E, with E being 0. Hmm, so the question is asking for the smallest possible number of copper coins, which probably means we need to maximize the number of brass coins since they pay more. \n\nFirst, let's convert the total amount to cents to make it easier. $3.40 is 340 cents. Let me denote the number of copper coins as C and brass coins as B. The equation would be 20C +25B = 340. We need to find the minimum C possible, so we want to maximize B. \n\nThe idea is to find the largest possible integer B such that when multiplied by 25 and subtracted from 340, the remainder is divisible by 20. Because 20C must equal 340 -25B. \n\nLet me think of possible values for B. Let's see. Let's start with the maximum possible B first. \n\nWhat's the maximum B can be? 340 divided by 25 is 13.6, so B can be up to 13. But 13 times 25 is 325. Then 340-325=15. 15 isn't divisible by 20, so that's no good. \n\nNext, B=12: 12*25=300. 340-300=40. 40 divided by 20 is 2. So C would be 2. That gives a total of 12 brass and 2 copper coins. Wait, but maybe there's a higher B where the remainder is divisible by 20. Let's check lower B values but maybe there's a better one.\n\nWait, maybe I should check in steps. Let's see:\n\nLet me try B=10: 25*10=250. 340-250=90. 90/20 is 4.5, which isn't an integer. Not good.\n\nB=11: 275. 340-275=65. 65/20=3.25, nope.\n\nB=12 gives 40, which works. So that gives C=2. But wait, the options have C=2 as option C. But maybe there's a higher B where the remainder is a multiple of 20? Let's check B= 8? Hmm, maybe not. Let me see.\n\nWait, B= 4: 25*4=100. 340-100=240. 240/20=12. So that's C=12, which would be more, so we want to minimize C. So higher B is better here.\n\nWait, so B=12 gives C=2. Let me check B= 13 again: 25*13=325. 340-325=15. 15 isn't divisible by 20. So that's invalid. \n\nWhat about B= 10? No. B= 9: 225. 340-225=115. 115 divided by 20 is 5.75. Not integer. \n\nB= 7: 175. 340-175=165. 165/20=8.25. Nope. \n\nB=6: 150. 340-150=190. 190/20=9.5. Still no. \n\nB=5: 125. 340-125=215. 215/20=10.75. Not.\n\nHmm. So B=12 is the highest possible B where the remainder is divisible by 20. That gives C=2. But wait, the options have C as 2. So the minimum number of copper coins would be 2? But let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me see. Let's try B= 10 again. 25*10=250. 340-250=90. 90 divided by 20 is 4.5. Not integer. \n\nWhat about B= 14? Wait, 25*14 is 350, which is over 340. So that's too much. \n\nSo the maximum B possible is 12, giving C=2. But the options include C=2 as option C. But the question asks for the minimum number of copper coins. So 2 would be the minimum here. But wait, the options have an option B as 3. Hmm, maybe I made an error here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed a possible B value. Let's see, perhaps B= 10. Wait, maybe another combination. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another combination where B is lower but C is even less? For example, can C be 1?\n\nIf C is 1, then 20*1 =20. 340-20=320. 320 must be divisible by 25. 320 divided by 25 is 12.8. Not an integer. So that's no.\n\nIf C=0, then 340 must be divisible by 25. 340/25 is 13.6, which isn't an integer. So that's no.\n\nSo the next possible minimum is 2. So the answer should be C)2. But wait, the options have C as 2. But the options given in the problem are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0. So C is an option. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another combination where C is lower. For example, B= 8? Let's see: 25*8=200. 340-200=140. 140/20=7. So that would give C=7. But that's higher than 2, so not better.\n\nAlternatively, B= 12 gives the minimum C=2. So the answer should be C)2. But let me see the options again. The problem is to find the minimum number of copper coins. So yes, 2 is the minimum possible. Therefore the correct answer is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's another possible combination where C is 1. Let me try again: 20C +25B=340. Let's set C=1. Then 20 +25B =340 \u2192 25B=320 \u2192 B=12.8. Not integer. So no. \n\nC=0 \u2192 25B=340 \u2192 B=13.6 \u2192 no. \n\nSo the next possible is 2. So the answer is C)2. \n\nWait, but the options have option C as 2, so that's the answer. Hmm. I think that's right. Let me check once more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate B=12: 12*25 is 300, so 340-300 is 40, 40/20 is 2. So yes. So the minimum is 2. So the answer is C. \n\nWait, but the options given in the problem: the options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0. So C is indeed an option. Therefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a higher B where the remainder is divisible by 20. Let's see. Let me check B= 10: 25*10=250, 340-250=90 \u2192 90/20=4.5 \u2192 no. B=11: 275, 340-275=65 \u219265/20=3.25 \u2192 no. \n\nB=14 is over. \n\nSo yes, B=12 is the maximum possible, leading to C=2. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is about a coin-diver who gets paid different amounts for copper and brass coins she finds in a river. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she must have brought up in a dive where she earned $3.40. The options are from A to E, with the numbers decreasing, so we need to find the smallest possible number of copper coins.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. For each copper coin, she gets 20 cents. Brass coins give 25 cents each. Total earned is $3.40, which is 340 cents. We need to find the minimum number of copper coins, so we want to maximize the number of brass coins because they pay more. That way, fewer coppers would be needed to reach the total.\n\nLet me set up equations. Let's let C be the number of copper coins and B the brass coins. Then:\n\n20C + 25B = 340 cents.\n\nWe need to find the minimal C such that this equation holds with B and C being non-negative integers.\n\nTo minimize C, we need to maximize B. So, we can rearrange the equation to solve for C in terms of B:\n\n20C = 340 -25B  \n=> C = (340 -25B)/20\n\nSince C must be an integer \u22650, the numerator (340-25B) must be divisible by 20 and non-negative.\n\nSo, let's find the maximum possible B where (340 -25B) is divisible by 20 and non-negative.\n\nLet me think of possible B values. Let's start with the largest possible B possible such that 25B \u2264340. The maximum B could be 340/25 = 13.6, so B can be up to 13. But we need to check if (340-25B) is divisible by 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps modulo arithmetic can help here. Let me see.\n\nWe can write the equation as 25B \u2261 340 mod 20. Let's compute 25 mod20 is 5, and 340 mod20 is 0 (since 340 divided by 20 is 17, so remainder 0). So equation becomes 5B \u22610 mod20. That simplifies to 5B must be a multiple of 20. So 5B mod20 =0 \u2192 B must be a multiple of 4. Because 5*B divisible by 20 \u2192 B divisible by 4 (since 20/ gcd(5,20)=20/5=4). So B must be a multiple of 4.\n\nTherefore possible B values are 0,4,8,12, etc., but since B can't exceed 13.6, the maximum possible B is 12. Let me check starting from the largest possible B that is a multiple of 4, and see what C would be.\n\nStart with B=12:\n\nThen, plugging into C=(340 -25*12)/20  \n25*12 is 300, so 340-300=40 \u2192 40/20=2. So C=2. So that would give C=2. So that's possible. Then, the number of copper coins would be 2. But wait, the options have C=2 as option C. But let's see if there's a higher B that could allow a lower C? Wait, but since we need to minimize C, the lower C is better. So if B=12 gives C=2, maybe even higher B would give lower C? Wait, but B can't be higher than 12 here since 25*13 is 325, which is less than 340. Wait, but 13 is not a multiple of 4. Let me check.\n\nWait, the next possible B after 12 would be 16, which is over 13. So no. So the next possible B is 12. Let's check if there are higher B values that are multiples of 4 but less than or equal to 13.6. 12 is the highest. \n\nWait, but let's check B=12 gives C=2. That's option C. But maybe there's another B value that allows a lower C? Let me check lower B multiples of 4:\n\nLet me check B=8. Then 25*8=200. 340-200=140 \u2192 140/20=7 \u2192 C=7. That's worse (higher C). \n\nB=4: 25*4=100 \u2192 340-100=240 \u2192 240/20=12 \u2192 C=12. Even higher. \n\nB=0: then C=340/20 =17. So that's even more.\n\nHmm. So the maximum B possible (with being a multiple of 4) gives the minimal C of 2. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2, which is option C. But wait, let me check another approach in case I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with the modulo calculation. Let me re-express the equation again.\n\n20C +25B=340. Let me divide the entire equation by 5 to simplify:\n\n4C +5B =68.\n\nSo now, 4C =68 -5B. So 68-5B must be divisible by 4, and the result must be non-negative.\n\nSo 5B must be congruent to 68 mod4. Let's compute 68 mod4 is 0 (since 68/4=17). So 5B mod4 \u22610 mod4.\n\n5 mod4 is 1, so 5B mod4 = B mod4. So B mod4 must be 0. So B must be divisible by 4. Which is what I had before.\n\nSo B must be 0,4,8,12, etc. So maximum B is 12. So then C=(68-5*12)/4 \u2192 (68-60)/4=8/4=2. So that gives C=2. So that's correct. So the minimal C is 2. So the answer should be C)2. But wait the options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0. So the answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's a B that's not a multiple of 4, but perhaps the equation still works? Wait, according to the modulo analysis, B has to be a multiple of 4. Because the equation requires 5B mod4 \u22610, which requires B mod4=0. So only multiples of 4. Therefore, the only possible B values are multiples of 4. \n\nWait, let me test B=12 gives C=2. So 12 brass coins and 2 coppers: 12*25=300, 2*20=40 \u2192 total 340. That's correct.\n\nWhat if someone tried B=13? Let's see: 13 is not a multiple of 4. Then 5B would be 65. 68-65=3 \u2192 4C=3 \u2192 C=0.75, which isn't integer. So no.\n\nB=11: 5*11=55 \u219268-55=13 \u21924C=13 \u2192nope.\n\nB=10: 5*10=50 \u219268-50=18 \u219218/4=4.5 \u2192 nope.\n\nB=9: 5*9=45 \u219268-45=23 \u219223/4=5.75 \u2192 no.\n\nB=8: as before, gives C=7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another combination where B isn't a multiple of 4 but gives integer C? Let me check with B= 12-4=8, but that's already considered. Let me think of another approach. Suppose I try to see possible combinations where 20C +25B =340. Let's see:\n\nSuppose we want to minimize C, so try to maximize B. Let's try B=13. 25*13=325. 340-325=15, which would need to be 20C \u2192 C=0.75, invalid. \n\nB=12: gives C=2 \u2192 valid. \n\nB=11: 25*11=275 \u2192 340-275=65 \u219265/20=3.25 \u2192 nope.\n\nB=10: 250 \u2192340-250=90 \u219290/20=4.5 \u2192 no.\n\nB=9: 225 \u2192 340-225=115 \u2192115/20=5.75 \u2192 nope.\n\nB=8 \u2192200 \u2192340-200=140 \u2192140/20=7 \u2192 yes, but higher C.\n\nB=7 \u2192175 \u2192 340-175=165 \u2192165/20=8.25 \u2192 no.\n\nB=6 \u2192150 \u2192 340-150=190 \u2192190/20=9.5 \u2192 no.\n\nB=5 \u2192125 \u2192 340-125=215 \u2192215/20=10.75 \u2192 no.\n\nB=4 \u2192100 \u2192340-100=240 \u2192240/20=12 \u2192 C=12 \u2192 which is worse.\n\nSo the only valid B values that work are when B is a multiple of 4.

      "full_content": "Okay, so the problem is about a coin-diver who gets paid different amounts for copper and brass coins she finds in a river. The question is asking for the minimum number of copper coins she must have brought up in a dive where she earned $3.40. The options are from A to E, with the numbers decreasing, so we need to find the smallest possible number of copper coins.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. For each copper coin, she gets 20 cents. Brass coins give 25 cents each. Total earned is $3.40, which is 340 cents. We need to find the minimum number of copper coins, so we want to maximize the number of brass coins because they pay more. That way, fewer coppers would be needed to reach the total.\n\nLet me set up equations. Let's let C be the number of copper coins and B the brass coins. Then:\n\n20C + 25B = 340 cents.\n\nWe need to find the minimal C such that this equation holds with B and C being non-negative integers.\n\nTo minimize C, we need to maximize B. So, we can rearrange the equation to solve for C in terms of B:\n\n20C = 340 -25B  \n=> C = (340 -25B)/20\n\nSince C must be an integer \u22650, the numerator (340-25B) must be divisible by 20 and non-negative.\n\nSo, let's find the maximum possible B where (340 -25B) is divisible by 20 and non-negative.\n\nLet me think of possible B values. Let's start with the largest possible B possible such that 25B \u2264340. The maximum B could be 340/25 = 13.6, so B can be up to 13. But we need to check if (340-25B) is divisible by 20.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps modulo arithmetic can help here. Let me see.\n\nWe can write the equation as 25B \u2261 340 mod 20. Let's compute 25 mod20 is 5, and 340 mod20 is 0 (since 340 divided by 20 is 17, so remainder 0). So equation becomes 5B \u22610 mod20. That simplifies to 5B must be a multiple of 20. So 5B mod20 =0 \u2192 B must be a multiple of 4. Because 5*B divisible by 20 \u2192 B divisible by 4 (since 20/ gcd(5,20)=20/5=4). So B must be a multiple of 4.\n\nTherefore possible B values are 0,4,8,12, etc., but since B can't exceed 13.6, the maximum possible B is 12. Let me check starting from the largest possible B that is a multiple of 4, and see what C would be.\n\nStart with B=12:\n\nThen, plugging into C=(340 -25*12)/20  \n25*12 is 300, so 340-300=40 \u2192 40/20=2. So C=2. So that would give C=2. So that's possible. Then, the number of copper coins would be 2. But wait, the options have C=2 as option C. But let's see if there's a higher B that could allow a lower C? Wait, but since we need to minimize C, the lower C is better. So if B=12 gives C=2, maybe even higher B would give lower C? Wait, but B can't be higher than 12 here since 25*13 is 325, which is less than 340. Wait, but 13 is not a multiple of 4. Let me check.\n\nWait, the next possible B after 12 would be 16, which is over 13. So no. So the next possible B is 12. Let's check if there are higher B values that are multiples of 4 but less than or equal to 13.6. 12 is the highest. \n\nWait, but let's check B=12 gives C=2. That's option C. But maybe there's another B value that allows a lower C? Let me check lower B multiples of 4:\n\nLet me check B=8. Then 25*8=200. 340-200=140 \u2192 140/20=7 \u2192 C=7. That's worse (higher C). \n\nB=4: 25*4=100 \u2192 340-100=240 \u2192 240/20=12 \u2192 C=12. Even higher. \n\nB=0: then C=340/20 =17. So that's even more.\n\nHmm. So the maximum B possible (with being a multiple of 4) gives the minimal C of 2. So the minimum number of copper coins is 2, which is option C. But wait, let me check another approach in case I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with the modulo calculation. Let me re-express the equation again.\n\n20C +25B=340. Let me divide the entire equation by 5 to simplify:\n\n4C +5B =68.\n\nSo now, 4C =68 -5B. So 68-5B must be divisible by 4, and the result must be non-negative.\n\nSo 5B must be congruent to 68 mod4. Let's compute 68 mod4 is 0 (since 68/4=17). So 5B mod4 \u22610 mod4.\n\n5 mod4 is 1, so 5B mod4 = B mod4. So B mod4 must be 0. So B must be divisible by 4. Which is what I had before.\n\nSo B must be 0,4,8,12, etc. So maximum B is 12. So then C=(68-5*12)/4 \u2192 (68-60)/4=8/4=2. So that gives C=2. So that's correct. So the minimal C is 2. So the answer should be C)2. But wait the options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0. So the answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's a B that's not a multiple of 4, but perhaps the equation still works? Wait, according to the modulo analysis, B has to be a multiple of 4. Because the equation requires 5B mod4 \u22610, which requires B mod4=0. So only multiples of 4. Therefore, the only possible B values are multiples of 4. \n\nWait, let me test B=12 gives C=2. So 12 brass coins and 2 coppers: 12*25=300, 2*20=40 \u2192 total 340. That's correct.\n\nWhat if someone tried B=13? Let's see: 13 is not a multiple of 4. Then 5B would be 65. 68-65=3 \u2192 4C=3 \u2192 C=0.75, which isn't integer. So no.\n\nB=11: 5*11=55 \u219268-55=13 \u21924C=13 \u2192nope.\n\nB=10: 5*10=50 \u219268-50=18 \u219218/4=4.5 \u2192 nope.\n\nB=9: 5*9=45 \u219268-45=23 \u219223/4=5.75 \u2192 no.\n\nB=8: as before, gives C=7. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is another combination where B isn't a multiple of 4 but gives integer C?

Let's see:\n\nSuppose we want to minimize C, so try to maximize B.
