      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the ratio of the volume of a cube to the volume of a sphere that fits inside the cube. Hmm, let me think. First, the sphere that fits inside the cube must be the inscribed sphere, right? That means the sphere touches all the sides of the cube but doesn't extend beyond them. So the diameter of the sphere should be equal to the edge length of the cube. Oh right, because if the sphere is perfectly fitting inside, the diameter would be the same as the cube's edge length.\n\nLet me denote the edge length of the cube as 'a'. Then the volume of the cube is a cubed, so V_cube = a\u00b3. Now the sphere's diameter is equal to 'a', which means the radius of the sphere is a/2. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Plugging in the radius, that would be (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)\u00b3. Let me calculate that.\n\nCalculating the sphere's volume: (4/3)\u03c0*(a\u00b3/8) = (4/3)*(1/8)*\u03c0*a\u00b3 = (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6. So the sphere's volume is (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6. \n\nNow, the ratio of cube's volume to the sphere's volume is V_cube / V_sphere = a\u00b3 / ( (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6 ). The a\u00b3 terms cancel out, so that becomes 1 / (\u03c0/(6)) which is 6/\u03c0. Wait, so the ratio is 6:\u03c0. Let me check the options again. Option D is 6:\u03c0. So that's the answer?\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. The question says the ratio of the cube to the sphere. So cube volume divided by sphere volume is 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6:\u03c0. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D. Let me look at the options again to confirm. Option D is indeed 6: \u03c0. The other options don't fit. Like option E is 8:3, which might be if someone messed up the sphere's formula. But I think my calculations are right. Let me just re-verify the sphere's volume formula. Yeah, (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. With radius a/2, so (a/2)^3 is a\u00b3/8. Multiply by 4/3 gives 4/(24) \u03c0 a\u00b3? Wait no, 4/3 times 1/8 is 4/(24) which simplifies to 1/6. So yeah, that's correct. So the ratio is cube volume over sphere volume is a\u00b3 divided by (\u03c0 a\u00b3 /6) equals 6/\u03c0. So 6:\u03c0. Yep, D is the answer.\n",
