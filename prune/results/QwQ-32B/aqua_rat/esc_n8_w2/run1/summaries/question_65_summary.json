      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Amy has 10 different types of books, and she wants to code each with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The question is asking for the smallest number of letters she needs so that all 10 types can be uniquely represented. The pairs don't consider order, so like AB is the same as BA, right?\n\nHmm, I think this is a combinations problem. Because when you pair two letters and order doesn't matter, that's combinations. So the total number of possible codes would be the number of single letters plus the number of combinations of two different letters. Let me think.\n\nLet me denote the number of letters as n. Then the number of single-letter codes would just be n. The number of two-letter codes would be the combination formula C(n,2) which is n(n-1)/2. So the total codes available would be n + n(n-1)/2. We need this total to be at least 10, since she has 10 types.\n\nSo the equation is n + [n(n-1)/2] \u2265 10. Let me solve this step by step. Let's rewrite the left side:\n\nTotal = n + (n(n-1)/2) = (2n + n(n-1)) / 2 = (n\u00b2 + n)/2.\n\nSo (n\u00b2 + n)/2 \u2265 10. Multiply both sides by 2: n\u00b2 + n \u2265 20. Then the quadratic inequality is n\u00b2 +n -20 \u22650.\n\nTo find the smallest integer n where this holds. Let's solve n\u00b2 +n -20 =0. Using quadratic formula: n = [-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +80)] /2. Since sqrt(81) is 9. So sqrt(81) is 9, so numerator is -1 +9=8, divided by 2 gives 4. The other solution would be negative, which we can ignore since n can't be negative.\n\nSo the equation equals zero at n=4. So when n=4, plugging back into the equation: 4\u00b2 +4 =16+4=20, which is exactly 20. So the total codes would be 20/2=10. Wait, so exactly 10. So that's exactly the number needed. So n=4 would give exactly 10 codes. But wait, the question says \"uniquely represented\", so 10 is exactly enough. So then the answer would be 4, which is option B. Let me check with smaller numbers just to be sure.\n\nIf n=3: Let's calculate. The total codes would be 3 + C(3,2) =3 +3=6. Which is less than 10. So 3 letters aren't enough. Then n=4 gives exactly 10 codes, so that's the minimum. Therefore the answer is B)4. Wait, but wait, the options include 4 as B, so that's correct. Let me think again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate for n=4. The single letters: 4. The pairs: since order doesn't matter, combinations of 2 from 4 letters. So 4*3/2=6. So total is 4+6=10. Exactly 10. So that's perfect. So 4 letters are sufficient, and 3 letters would only give 3+3=6, which is not enough. Therefore the smallest number is 4, so the answer is B.\n",
