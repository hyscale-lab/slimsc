      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about Bill riding his bicycle. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes. Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I remember that distance equals speed multiplied by time. The formula is distance = speed \u00d7 time. So I need to find his speed on a windy day and then multiply it by the time he's riding, which is 21 minutes. But wait, the units here might be tricky because his speed is in miles per hour, and the time is in minutes. I need to convert the time to hours to make the units match. \n\nAlright, so let's start. On a normal day, Bill's speed is 15 mph. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. That means his speed on a windy day would be 15 minus 4. Let me do that subtraction: 15 - 4 equals 11 mph. So his speed on a windy day is 11 miles per hour. Got that part.\n\nNow, the time given is 21 minutes. Since the speed is per hour, I need to convert 21 minutes into a fraction of an hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes divided by 60 will give me the time in hours. Let me calculate that: 21 divided by 60. Hmm, 21 divided by 60 is 0.35 hours. Wait, is that right? Let me check. 60 minutes is 1 hour, so 21/60 = 0.35. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nSo now, using the formula distance = speed \u00d7 time. His speed is 11 mph and time is 0.35 hours. Multiplying those together: 11 * 0.35. Let me do that math. 11 times 0.3 is 3.3, and 11 times 0.05 is 0.55. Adding those together: 3.3 + 0.55 equals 3.85. Wait a second, that gives me 3.85 miles. But hold on, let me double-check that multiplication another way. 0.35 times 11. Let's see, 10 times 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 times 0.35 is 0.35, so 3.5 + 0.35 is indeed 3.85. So that's 3.85 miles. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 3.85. But wait, the problem says to round to the nearest hundredth. Let me see if there's any decimal beyond two places that might affect that. Let me recalculate the exact multiplication again. 11 multiplied by 0.35. 11 * 0.35 = (10 * 0.35) + (1 * 0.35) = 3.5 + 0.35 = 3.85. Exactly two decimal places, so no rounding needed. So the answer should be 3.85 miles, which is option D.\n\nBut hold on, let me check the options again. The options are A)2, B)2.25, C)3.25, D)3.85, E)2.85. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the speed? Let me confirm the problem again. The question says on a windy day his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So original speed is 15, so 15-4 is 11. That's correct. Time is 21 minutes, converted to 0.35 hours. So 11 * 0.35 is 3.85. So yes, D is the answer. But wait, why is E an option? Maybe I miscalculated? Let me see another way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that 21 minutes is 0.35 hours? Wait, yes, 21 divided by 60 is 0.35. So that's right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation? Let me check again. The question says \"how far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes?\" So yes, the speed is 11 mph. So 11 multiplied by 21/60. Let me compute 21/60 first. 21 divided by 60 equals 0.35. So 11 * 0.35 = 3.85. \n\nHmm, so that's correct. So the answer should be D. But wait, the options have E as 2.85. Maybe I miscalculated? Let me check again. 11 * 21 = 231. Then divide by 60 to get miles per hour? Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, actually, the formula is speed multiplied by time. So 11 mph * (21/60) hours. So 11 *21 = 231, then divided by 60. Let me compute that. 231 divided by 60. Let's see, 60*3=180, subtract that from 231, which leaves 51. 51 divided by 60 is 0.85. So total is 3.85. Yep. So that's correct. So D is the correct answer. \n\nWait, but maybe I misread the question? Let me check again. The problem says \"how far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes?\" So yes, that's exactly what I calculated. So the answer must be D. But why is option E there? Let me see if there's a common mistake. Maybe someone might have thought that 4 mph is the reduction, so 15-4=11, but then maybe they converted time wrong. Like 21 minutes as 21/60, but maybe someone divides 11 by 60 and multiplies by 21? Wait, that's exactly what I did. 11*(21/60). So that's correct. So I think the correct answer is D, 3.85. So the answer should be D.\n",
