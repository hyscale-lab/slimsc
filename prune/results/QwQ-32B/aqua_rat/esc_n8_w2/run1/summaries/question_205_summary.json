      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about the rate at which a liquid passes through a drain. The given rate is w/25 gallons every x seconds. We need to find how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through. Alright, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I remember that rate problems often involve the formula: time = amount / rate. But I need to make sure the units are consistent. The rate here is given in gallons per seconds, and the question asks for time in minutes. So maybe I need to convert seconds to minutes somewhere.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the rate. The problem states that the drain passes w/25 gallons every x seconds. So the rate (R) in gallons per second would be (w/25) divided by x. Wait, actually, that's right. Because rate is gallons per second. So R = (w/25) / x. Alternatively, that can be written as w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nNow, we need to find the time it takes to drain y gallons. Using the formula time = amount / rate. The amount here is y gallons. So the time in seconds would be y divided by the rate. Let me write that:\n\nTime (seconds) = y / (w/(25x)) = y * (25x)/w = (25xy)/w.\n\nBut the question asks for the time in minutes, not seconds. Oh right! So I have to convert seconds to minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, the time in minutes would be the time in seconds divided by 60. So:\n\nTime (minutes) = (25xy)/w divided by 60 = (25xy)/(60w).\n\nHmm, let's simplify that fraction. 25 and 60 can both be divided by 5. 25/5 is 5, 60/5 is 12. So that becomes (5xy)/(12w). Wait, that would be 5xy over 12w. Let me check my steps again to be sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting over: Rate is (w/25 gallons) per x seconds. So per second, it's (w/(25x)) gallons per second. To find time for y gallons, time in seconds is y divided by that rate. So y / (w/(25x)) = 25xy/w seconds. Then converting to minutes: divide by 60, so (25xy)/(60w). Simplify numerator and denominator: 25/60 reduces to 5/12. So yes, that gives (5xy)/(12w). \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5xy/(12w). That must be the correct answer. Let me check the other options to make sure I didn't mix up anything.\n\nOption A is y/(1200xy), which seems way too small. Option B is 20xy/w. That would be if maybe the units were mixed up or if there was a miscalculation. Let's see: If I messed up the conversion from seconds to minutes, like maybe multiplied by 60 instead of dividing? Wait, no. Let's see. Suppose I thought the rate was per minute. Wait, maybe I should consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of units analysis. The rate is given in gallons per x seconds. Let me see:\n\nThe rate in gallons per second is (w/25) / x. So the rate R = w/(25x) gal/s.\n\nTime needed for y gallons is y / R = y / (w/(25x)) = 25xy/w seconds. To convert seconds to minutes, divide by 60, so 25xy/(60w) = 5xy/(12w). Yep, that's the same as before. So C is correct. \n\nHmm, another way: Let's plug in numbers. Suppose w is 25, x is 1 second, then the rate is (25/25)/1 = 1 gallon per second. So y gallons would take y seconds, which is y/60 minutes. Let's see what option C gives when w=25, x=1, then 5*(1)*y/(12*25) = 5y/(300) = y/60. Which matches. So that's correct. \n\nIf I tried option E, for example, 3y/(wx) with those numbers would be 3y/(25*1) = 3y/25, which is not y/60. So that's wrong. Option B would be 20*1*y/25 = (20y)/25 = 0.8y, which is way off. So definitely C works here. \n\nTherefore the correct answer must be option C.\n",

So that would be (w)/(25x) gallons per second. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the drain's rate is (w/25) gallons every x seconds. So, to find the time needed for y gallons, I can set up a proportion. Let me write down what I know.\n\nThe rate (R) is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So, R = (w/25) gal / x sec. To find the time (T) it takes to drain y gallons, the formula would be T = y / R. Because time equals volume divided by rate. \n\nSo substituting R into that, T = y / [(w/25)/x] = y * (x)/(w/25) ) = y * (25x)/w. That would give me the time in seconds. But the question asks for minutes, so I need to convert seconds to minutes. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, I divide by 60. \n\nSo total time in minutes would be (25x y)/w divided by 60. Let me compute that: (25xy/w) * (1/60) = (25xy)/(60w). Let's simplify that fraction. 25 and 60 have a common factor of 5. 25 divided by 5 is 5, 60 divided by 5 is 12.

Let me see if any other option could be a result of a miscalculation. Like, maybe if I messed up the rate.

So the original approach seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I inverted something. Let me think again. Suppose the rate is w/25 gallons per x seconds. So in x seconds, you get w/25 gallons. So to get y gallons, how many x-second intervals are needed? That would be (y) divided by (w/25), so (25y)/w intervals. Each interval is x seconds, so total time is (25y/w)*x seconds. Then converting to minutes, divide by 60. So same as before. Yep. So that gives the same result. So definitely C. \n\nHmm, I think that's solid. Let me check the options again. Option E is 3y/(wx).
