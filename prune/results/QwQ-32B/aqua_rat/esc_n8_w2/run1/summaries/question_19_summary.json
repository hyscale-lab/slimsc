      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem about averages in a class exam. The question is asking for the average score of the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. The given variables are x, which is the average of the highest and lowest scores, y is the overall average for the entire class, and z is the number of students. The answer needs to be in terms of x, y, and z.\n\nHmm, let me break it down step by step. First, the average of the highest and lowest is x. So that means if I let the highest score be H and the lowest be L, then (H + L)/2 = x. So multiplying both sides by 2 gives H + L = 2x. Got that part.\n\nThe overall average for the entire class is y. Since there are z students, the total sum of all the scores must be z times y. So total sum S = z*y.\n\nNow, if we want the average excluding the highest and lowest, we need to subtract those two scores from the total sum and then divide by the remaining number of students. The remaining students would be z minus 2, right?\n\nSo the sum without H and L is S - (H + L) = zy - 2x (since H+L is 2x). Then the average would be (zy - 2x) divided by (z - 2). \n\nLooking at the options, option D is (zy - 2x)/(z - 2). That seems to match. Let me check the other options to be sure. \n\nOption A is (zy - 2x)/z. That would be dividing by the original number of students, but we removed two, so that's not right. Option B has a -2 instead of 2x, so that can't be. Option C has (zx - y) which doesn't make sense because the total sum is zy, not zx. And E has z+2 in the denominator, which is the opposite of what we need. So yeah, D is the correct one.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make any miscalculations. Let me rephrase: total sum is zy. Subtract H and L, whose sum is 2x, so the new sum is zy - 2x. The number of students left is z-2. Therefore the average is (zy -2x)/(z-2). Yep, that's exactly option D. I think that's right.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about finding the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. The given information includes the average of the highest and lowest scores being x, the overall average y, and the number of students z, where z is more than 5. I need to express the desired average in terms of x, y, and z. \n\nFirst, let me recall that the average score for the entire class is y. Since there are z students, the total sum of all the scores must be y multiplied by z. So total sum = z*y. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the problem mentions the average of the highest and lowest scores is x. So if I let the highest score be H and the lowest be L, then (H + L)/2 = x. Which means H + L = 2x. Got that. So the sum of just those two students is 2x.\n\nThe question asks for the average of all the other students except those two. So how many students are we considering now? Originally z students, minus 2 (the highest and lowest), so z-2 students. The total sum of their scores would be the total sum minus the sum of H and L. \n\nSo the total sum excluding H and L is (z*y) - (H + L) = zy - 2x. Then the average of the remaining students would be that total divided by (z-2). So putting that together, the average is (zy - 2x)/(z -2). \n\nLet me check the options. Looking at the options, D is exactly that. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. \n\nWait, let me verify each step again. \n\nTotal sum of all scores: yes, average y times number of students z, so zy. Correct.\n\nSum of highest and lowest: since their average is x, adding them gives 2x. Right.\n\nSubtracting that from total gives zy - 2x. Then dividing by the remaining students (z-2) gives the average. So yes, (zy - 2x)/(z-2). \n\nLooking at the options again: \n\nA is (zy-2x)/z. That would be if we were keeping all students but subtracting 2x, but that's not the case here. \n\nB has 2 instead of 2x, which doesn't make sense because the sum of H and L is 2x, not 2. So B is wrong. \n\nC is (zx - y)/(z-2). Wait, that uses x multiplied by z, which isn't part of the given data. So that's probably incorrect. \n\nD is exactly what I got. \n\nE has (zy -x) divided by (z+2). That doesn't fit because subtracting x instead of 2x and adding 2 to z, which isn't right. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be D. I don't see any errors in my reasoning here. Let me think of a sample scenario to test. \n\nSuppose there are 10 students (z=10). Let\u2019s say the highest score is 100 and the lowest is 80. Their average is (100+80)/2 = 90, so x is 90. The total of all scores is y * 10. Let\u2019s pick an average y. Suppose overall average y is 85. Then total is 850. The sum of the other 8 students (excluding the top and bottom) would be 850 - (100 +80) = 850 - 180 = 670. The average would be 670/8 = 83.75. \n\nNow plug into the options. Let's see D: (zy - 2x)/(z-2) = (10*85 - 2*90)/(10-2) = (850 - 180)/8 = 670/8 = 83.75. That matches. \n\nIf I check option A: (10*85 - 2*90)/10 = (850-180)/10=670/10=67, which is wrong. So D works here. \n\nAnother test case: z=6 (but z>5, so okay). Let's say highest is 90, lowest 70, so their average x is 80. Suppose overall average y is 75. Total sum is 6*75=450. Sum excluding top and bottom is 450 - (90+70) = 450-160=290. The average for the remaining 4 students is 290/4 = 72.5. \n\nUsing D: (6*75 -2*80)/(6-2) = (450 -160)/4 = 290/4 =72.5. Correct again. \n\nSo I think D is the right answer here. The other options don't fit. So the answer must be D.\n",
