      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so here's this problem: A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, what's his new expenditure? The options are given. Hmm, let's think through this step by step.\n\nAlright, first, let me parse the question. The man originally spends 70% of his income. Let's say his original income is, I don't know, maybe $100 just to make the math easier. So if his income is $100, he spends 70% of that, which is $70. Then his savings would be $30, right?\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%. So the new income is the original plus 20% of it. If the original was $100, a 20% increase would be 20% of 100, which is $20. So his new income is $120. \n\nBut the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage. Wait, the problem doesn't say whether his expenditure increases in line with income or stays the same. Hmm, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me read it again. \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" The way it's phrased might imply that his expenditure as a percentage of the new income is what we need to find. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says he \"spends 70% of his income\" originally. So if his income goes up, unless told otherwise, maybe his expenditure in absolute terms stays the same? Or does his expenditure percentage stay the same? Hmm, that's a crucial point. Because the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" The key here is whether the 70% is a fixed percentage of his income, so if his income increases, does he continue to spend 70% of the new income? But that would mean the expenditure would also increase, but the problem doesn't state that. Wait, maybe the question is implying that his expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, so the percentage would change. But that's conflicting with the initial statement. Wait, maybe I need to think of it this way: The problem says he spends 70% of his income. So, perhaps the 70% is his current expenditure rate. Now, when his income increases, unless told that his expenditure rate changes, the question might be expecting us to calculate the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income, assuming that his expenditure amount stays the same. Because otherwise, if he continues to spend 70% of his new income, then the answer would just be 70% again, which isn't an option here. But the options given are different percentages, so that can't be. Therefore, the assumption must be that his expenditure in absolute terms remains the same, but the percentage changes because income has gone up. \n\nAh right, that makes sense. Let me see. Let's go through the steps again with that in mind.\n\nOriginal income: Let's take $100 as before. So original expenditure is 70% of 100 = $70. \n\nIncome increases by 20%, so new income is 120. \n\nAssuming his expenditure remains the same in absolute terms (still $70), then the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income would be (70 / 120) * 100. Let me calculate that. \n\n70 divided by 120 equals... 70/120 = 0.583333... So multiplying by 100 gives 58.333...%, which is approximately 58.3%, which is option A. \n\nWait, but the options given include A as 58.3%, which matches. But wait, another way to interpret the problem: perhaps the expenditure increases by the same percentage as income? Like, if his income went up by 20%, he might spend 20% more? But that would be 70 * 1.2 = 84, so 84/120 = 70%, which again isn't an option. So that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is implying that his expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income. But the problem doesn't state that. The question is ambiguous. Wait, but the standard way these problems are usually phrased, when they say \"spends X% of income\" and then income changes, unless told otherwise, the expenditure as a percentage of income is the same. Wait, no, that's conflicting with the options here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the way the question is phrased. The original question is \"what will be his new expenditure?\" The options are percentages. So if the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income? Or of his new income? The question says \"his new expenditure\", so probably as a percentage of his new income. \n\nLet me re-express this. \n\nLet me formalize:\n\nLet original income be I. Original expenditure E = 0.7I. \n\nNew income is I + 20% of I = 1.2I. \n\nAssuming expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, then new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (E)/(1.2I) * 100 = (0.7I / 1.2I)*100 = (0.7/1.2)*100 \u2248 58.33%. So that's option A. \n\nAlternatively, if the expenditure increases proportionally with income (so he continues to spend 70%), then the expenditure would be 0.7 * 1.2I = 0.84I, which would be 84% of original income, but as a percentage of new income, it's still 70%. Since the question's options don't have 70%, that's not possible, so the first interpretation must be correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A)58.3%. \n\nWait, but looking at the options again. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, etc. So that's correct. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that expenditure remains the same. Let me read the problem again. \n\nThe problem states \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" The wording is ambiguous. It could be interpreted as: the man's expenditure is 70% of his original income, and when his income increases by 20%, what's his expenditure now? If the problem is asking for the expenditure as a percentage of the original income, then 70% of original income is still 70%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, the question might be implying that the man's expenditure increases in the same proportion as his income. Wait, but that's not stated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is saying that he continues to spend the same proportion of his income. Wait, but that would mean expenditure is still 70%, so that can't be. Since the options don't have that, the other interpretation must be correct. So the answer is A. \n\nHmm, but why is option B 62.5% there? Let me check my math again. \n\nOriginal expenditure: 70. New income 120. \n\n70 divided by 120: Let's calculate that again. 70 \u00f7 120. Let me do this division. 120 \u00d7 0.5 is 60. 70-60 is 10. So 0.5 + (10/120) = 0.5 + 0.083333... = 0.583333..., so yes, 58.333%. So that's exactly 58.333%, which rounds to 58.3% as option A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A. But wait, maybe the question is interpreted differently. Suppose the man's expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income. Let's see: \n\nOriginal expenditure is 70% of income. If income increases by 20%, then expenditure also increases by 20%, so new expenditure is 70% * 1.2 = 84% of original income. But the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. \n\nOriginal income was I, new is 1.2I. So the expenditure is 0.84I, so (0.84I)/(1.2I) * 100 = 70%. Again, that's the same as before, so that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is saying that he spends 70% of his income, so his savings are 30%. If his income increases by 20%, maybe he maintains the same savings rate? Wait, but that's not stated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in another way. Let me think again. Maybe the question is phrased such that when his income increases by 20%, his expenditure increases by 20% as well? But that would make his new expenditure 70 * 1.2 = 84, which as a percentage of the new income (120) would be 70%. \n\nHmm, but that's not an option. So perhaps the question is expecting the expenditure to remain the same in absolute terms. So the percentage would be 58.3%, so answer A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the income is 100. Let me try with variables. \n\nLet initial income be I. So expenditure E = 0.7I. \n\nNew income is 1.2I. \n\nIf expenditure remains the same (E = 0.7I), then new expenditure percentage is (0.7I / 1.2I)*100 = 58.333...%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options given are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. So A is correct. \n\nHmm, but why is there another option like 62.5? Maybe I made a wrong assumption. Wait, perhaps the question is saying that his expenditure increases by 20%, so the new expenditure is 70% + 20% of 70%? Wait, no, that would be 70 + 14 = 84, but again, that's 84 over original income. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the expenditure's percentage increases by 20% points? Like from 70% to 90%? That can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I have a miscalculation here. Wait, let me try with another example. Suppose his income was $200. \n\nOriginal expenditure: 70% of 200 is 140. \n\nIncome increases by 20%: new income is 240. \n\nIf expenditure stays the same (140), then 140/240 is 0.58333..., so same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is implying that the man's expenditure as a percentage of his income increases by the same rate as his income? Like, his expenditure percentage increases by 20% of 70? That would be 70 + (0.2*70) = 84%, so 84% of the new income. But that would be 84% of 240, which would be expenditure of 201.6, but that's not a percentage. Wait, no. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Wait, perhaps the man spends 70% of his income. Then, when his income increases by 20%, he spends 70% of the increased income. But that would mean expenditure is still 70%, which is not an option. \n\nHmm, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the question is expecting the expenditure to remain the same in absolute terms, so the percentage drops. So the answer must be A. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" The options are percentages. So the question must be asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income. \n\nSo, with the calculation as before, it's 58.333%, which is A. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is A. Therefore, the answer is option A.\n",

That brings us back again to 70%, which isn't an option. So that's not the right approach.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let's try another approach. Let me assign variables. Let's say his original income is I. So he spends 70% of I, which is 0.7I. His savings would be 0.3I.\n\nNow, his income increases by 20%, so new income is I + 20% of I = 1.2I. The question is, what's the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income?\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify whether his expenditure increases in absolute terms or remains the same. Since the question is from percentage to percentage, perhaps the problem assumes that his expenditure increases by the same 20%? Like, if he was spending 70% before, now he spends 70% + 20% of that? Wait, no, that might not make sense. Alternatively, maybe he maintains the same absolute expenditure? Wait, if he continues to spend the same amount (70% of original income) then the new expenditure as a percentage would be (0.7I)/(1.2I) * 100 = (0.7/1.2)*100 \u2248 58.33%. Which is option A. But why would the question assume that his expenditure remains the same in absolute terms?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the man's expenditure increases proportionally to his income, but in terms of percentage? Like, he continues to spend 70% of his income. Then the expenditure would still be 70% of the new income, which is 70% of 1.2I, but as a percentage of new income, that's still 70%, which isn't an option. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by the same absolute amount as his income? Wait, but the income increased by 20%. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure as a percentage of his income increases. Wait, but how? Let me see the options. The options are all higher than 58, but the first option is 58.3. Wait, the problem might not be that the expenditure increases, but if he spends the same absolute amount, then the percentage of new income would be lower. So 58.3 is option A. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is that he increases his expenditure by the same percentage as his income. Let's see. Let's suppose his expenditure was 70% of original income. So if income goes up 20%, then the new expenditure is 70% * 1.2 = 84% of original income. But the new income is 120% of original. So 84/120 = 70% again? Wait, that can't be. Wait, that gives back 70%, which isn't an option. So that approach isn't right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure as a percentage increases by the same rate as the income? Like, the 70% increases by 20%? So 70% * 1.2 = 84%. But 84% is higher than the original 70%, but 84 is not an option. The options are up to 65.5. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, maybe the question is implying that his savings rate remains the same? Let me think. Wait, original savings is 30%. If his income increases by 20%, and he keeps the same savings rate, then his expenditure would be 70% of the new income. But that's 70% again, which isn't an option. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to read the question again. \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" The options are percentages. The key here might be that when income increases, the expenditure increases in absolute terms but the percentage is calculated over the new income. But the problem doesn't state whether his expenditure increases in absolute or proportionally. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that his expenditure increases by the same 20%, so the expenditure in absolute terms is 70% * 1.2. Let me see:\n\nOriginal income: let's say 100 units. So original expenditure is 70 units. Income increases by 20% \u2192 new income is 120. If expenditure increases by 20%, then new expenditure is 70 * 1.2 = 84. Then, the new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (84 / 120)*100 = 70%. Still same as before, so that's not matching options. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where the expenditure is the same percentage, but the options are wrong? Or maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, maybe the question is saying that he spends 70% of his income, so his savings is 30%. When income increases by 20%, his savings amount increases, but the question is about the new expenditure. Wait, perhaps the expenditure remains at 70% of the original income? Like he doesn't change his spending habits. Then the expenditure would be 70 units (if original was 100), new income 120. So 70/120 = 58.333...%, which is option A. That's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that he increases his expenditure by the same percentage as his income. Wait, but that would be 20% increase on expenditure. So original expenditure 70, new is 84. Then 84/120 is 70% again. \n\nHmm. The options given are A)58.3, B)62.5, etc. So 58.3 is the first option. So perhaps the answer is A. But why would the question assume that expenditure stays the same in absolute terms? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Let me think again. Let me try with variables.\n\nLet original income be I. Original expenditure E = 0.7I. \n\nNew income is I + 20% of I = 1.2I. \n\nThe question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. \n\nBut what is the new expenditure? The problem doesn't say whether he increases his expenditure or not. So maybe the question is assuming that his expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income. So E_new = E * 1.2 = 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. \n\nThen, new expenditure as a percentage of new income (which is 1.2I) is (0.84I)/(1.2I) *100 = (0.84/1.2)*100 = 70%. Not an option. \n\nHmm, so that approach gives 70%, which isn't in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the expenditure increases in such a way that his savings percentage remains the same? Wait, original savings was 30% (since expenditure is 70%). If the savings percentage remains the same, then expenditure would still be 70% of new income. So again 70%, which is not an option. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. The options given must mean that the answer is one of them, so perhaps my initial assumption is wrong. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the question is not about the expenditure as a percentage of income, but the new expenditure in absolute terms compared to the original? But the options are percentages, so that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in another way. Maybe the man's expenditure is 70% of his income, so when income increases by 20%, his expenditure increases by 20% of the original expenditure. Wait, but that would be E_new = 70 + 20% of 70 = 84, so again 84/(120) = 70% again. \n\nHmm, maybe the question is phrased differently. Wait, perhaps the question is saying that he spends 70% of his income, and when his income increases by 20%, he now spends a higher percentage, but how much? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by the same amount as his income. Wait, that would mean the expenditure increases by 20% of the original income. Wait, original income is I. 20% increase is 0.2I. So new income is 1.2I. \n\nIf expenditure increases by the same absolute amount as income (i.e., 0.2I), then new expenditure would be 0.7I + 0.2I = 0.9I. Then, as a percentage of new income (1.2I) would be (0.9/1.2)*100 = 75%. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the expenditure increases by the same percentage as the income. So 20% increase over the original expenditure. \n\nOriginal expenditure 70% of I \u2192 0.7I. 20% increase \u2192 0.7I * 1.2 = 0.84I. As a percentage of new income (1.2I) \u2192 0.84/1.2 = 0.7 \u2192 70%. Not an option. \n\nHmm. This is perplexing. Let me check the options again. The options are A)58.3, B)62.5, C)63.5, D)64.5, E)65.5. \n\nWait, 58.3 is exactly 70/1.2. Because 70 divided by 1.2 is 58.333... So that would be if the expenditure remains the same in absolute terms. For example, if his original income was 100, he spent 70. Now income is 120, so 70/120 is 58.33%. So that's option A. \n\nBut why would the question assume that his expenditure remains the same? The question says \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" The phrasing is ambiguous. But in percentage terms of the new income, if he doesn't change his expenditure, then it's 58.3%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the man's expenditure increases by the same rate as his income. But that gives 70%, which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the man's expenditure increases by 20%, so the new expenditure is 70% + 20% of 70% = 70% +14% =84% of original income. But then as a percentage of new income (120% original), it's (84/120)*100 =70%. \n\nHmm, but that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Maybe the question is in terms of the expenditure's percentage increase. Like, if his expenditure was 70% of income, and income increases by 20%, what is the new expenditure percentage? But the question is unclear. \n\nWait, maybe the question is from an Indian curriculum, and there's a standard way to interpret it. Maybe the expenditure increases by the same percentage as income. Wait, but that gives 70% again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that his expenditure is 70% of his income, so if his income increases by 20%, then his new expenditure is 70% of his new income, which would be 70% of 120% of original income. But then, as a percentage of new income, it's still 70%, which isn't an option. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the increase in expenditure as a percentage of the original income?
