      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about students attending a prom night and a debating session. The question is asking for the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debating session. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the school has 200 students total. The problem states that at least 45% attended the prom and at least 35% took part in the debating. So first, let me convert those percentages to actual numbers. \n\n45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. So at least 90 went to the prom. Similarly, 35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students for the debating session. \n\nThe question is about the maximum number of students who didn't attend either event. To maximize that number, I need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the two events. Because the total students not in either would be 200 minus those who attended at least one.\n\nHmm, right. So the key here is to find the minimal possible number of students who went to prom or debate, then subtract that from 200 to get the maximum number who didn't go to either. \n\nWait, but how do I find the minimal overlap here? Because if the two groups (prom and debate attendees) overlap as much as possible, then the total number attending at least one event would be as small as possible. That way, the remaining students (those not in either) would be as large as possible.\n\nOh right, the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula is |A \u222a B| = |A| + |B| - |A \u2229 B|. To minimize |A \u222a B|, we need to maximize the overlap |A \u2229 B|. \n\nSo the minimal number of students attending at least one event is when the overlap is as big as possible. Let me think. Since the prom has at least 90 and debate at least 70, the maximum possible overlap would be the smaller of the two groups. Wait, no. Wait, the maximum possible overlap between the two is the size of the smaller group. For example, if all the debate attendees were also at the prom, then the overlap would be 70, so the total would be 90 +70 -70 =90. But maybe that's possible?\n\nWait, let me check. Let's see, if the debate attendees are all part of the prom attendees, then the total attending either is 90. That would mean the minimal possible total. So the maximum number not attending either would be 200 -90 =110. But wait, but the problem says \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So the prom could have more than 90, and debate more than 70. Wait, but to find the minimal total, we can set the prom to exactly 90 and debate exactly 70, and have as much overlap as possible.\n\nWait, but maybe even if they have maximum overlap, the minimal possible union is 90 (if all debate attendees are in prom). So that would give 200-90=110. But then option E is 110. But the options include that. But wait, hold on, let me think again. Wait, the problem says \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%. So the actual numbers could be higher. But to find the maximum number of students who didn't attend either, we need to take the minimal possible numbers for the events. Wait, no, actually, to minimize the total number of students who went to either, we need the events to have as few students as possible, but the problem says at least those percentages. So the minimal possible for prom is 90, debate 70. So to get the minimal union, set them to their minimums and maximize overlap. \n\nSo in that case, the minimal possible union is 90 +70 - overlap. To minimize the union, maximize the overlap. The maximum possible overlap between the two is the smaller of the two groups. Since 70 is smaller (debate), then the maximum possible overlap is 70. So the union would be 90 +70 -70 =90. Thus, the remaining is 200-90=110. But wait, that's option E. But the options also have a higher number? Wait, no, option E is 110. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure. Let me rephrase the problem. The question is asking for the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debate. To maximize that, the number of students who attended at least one should be as small as possible. So the minimal possible value of (prom + debate - overlap) is when overlap is maximum.\n\nSo if prom is exactly 90 and debate exactly 70, then the maximum overlap is 70 (since debate can't have more than 70). So the union is 90. Thus, 200 - 90 =110. So 110 is the answer? But wait, let me check the options. Option E is 110, which would be the answer here. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose that the prom has 90 students and the debate has 70. The maximum overlap is 70 (all debate attendees are in the prom). So total in at least one is 90. So the remaining is 110. But the problem says \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% debated\". So the actual numbers could be higher. Wait, but if we are trying to find the maximum possible number of students who didn't attend either, then we want the number of attendees to be as small as possible. So the minimal possible attendees would be when the prom and debate have exactly their minimum required numbers (90 and 70) and as much overlap as possible. So that gives the minimal total attendees, leading to maximum non-attendees. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 110, which is option E. But wait, looking at the options again, option E is 110. But let me check if there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try using the formula for maximum possible not attending. \n\nThe maximum number of students who didn't attend either is equal to total students minus the minimum number who attended at least one. \n\nThe minimum number who attended at least one is (A + B - total), but that's not exactly. Wait, the formula is |A \u222a B| = A + B - |A \u2229 B|. To minimize |A \u222a B|, maximize |A \u2229 B|. The maximum possible |A \u2229 B| can't exceed the size of either set. Since A (prom) is at least 90 and B (debate) is at least 70, the maximum possible overlap is 70 (since B is 70). So the minimal union would be 90 +70 -70 =90. \n\nThus, 200 -90=110. So that's correct. So the answer should be E. \n\nWait, but why is there an option D)99? Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have to consider that the percentages are at least, so the minimum numbers are 90 and 70. But maybe when the prom and debate have as little overlap as possible, but that's the opposite. Wait, no, to get minimal union, you need maximum overlap. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in words, \"at least 45% attended the prom\" \u2014 so the number could be higher, but to minimize the total, we set them to the minimum possible. So I think my original approach is correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is E)110. But let me check the options again. The options given are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. So E is there. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that 45% and 35% are both minimums, so you can't have the prom exactly 90 and debate exactly 70? Wait, no, the problem says \"at least 45%\", so the minimum possible for prom is 90 (since 45% of 200 is exactly 90). Similarly, 35% is exactly 70. So those are acceptable. So in that case, yes, the maximum non-attendees would be 110. \n\nHmm, but let me see another angle. Suppose that the prom attendance is 90 and debate is 70, and all 70 debate attendees are part of the 90 prom attendees. So the union is 90. Then, 200-90=110. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here. Like, the problem says \"at least\" for both, so the actual numbers could be higher, but to get the maximum number of people not attending either, you need the minimal possible attendees. So the minimal possible for each is 90 and 70, and maximum overlap. So the calculation holds. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be E)110. But let me check again. Wait, maybe I miscalculated percentages? Let me confirm. \n\n45% of 200 is indeed 90, and 35% is 70. So yes. \n\nHmm, maybe the question is a trick where the \"at least\" applies to both events, so the minimal possible for each is 90 and 70. Thus, the minimal union is 90. So the answer is E. I think that's right. \n\nWait, but let me think again. If the prom had exactly 90, and debate exactly 70, and all debate attendees are in the prom, then the total in at least one is 90. So 200-90 is 110. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about figuring out the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom or the debate. Let me see. The school has 200 students. At least 45% went to the prom and at least 35% were in the debate. I need to find the maximum possible number who missed both events. Hmm, right.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the maximum number of students who didn't attend either. To maximize the number of students who didn't go to either, I think I need to minimize the number of students who went to at least one of the events. Because the total is fixed at 200, so if fewer went to either, more didn't go. \n\nAlright, so how do I minimize the number of students who went to prom or debate? I remember something about inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for the union of two sets is A + B - A\u2229B. To minimize the total number, I need to maximize the overlap between the two groups. Because the more overlap there is between prom and debate attendees, the smaller the total number of unique attendees. \n\nLet me write that down. Let P be the number who went to prom, D the number in debate. The problem states that at least 45% (so at least 90 students) went to prom, and at least 35% (so 70 students) were in debate. To minimize P \u222a D, we want the intersection P \u2229 D to be as large as possible. \n\nThe maximum possible overlap between P and D would be the smaller of the two groups. Since 35% (70) is less than 45% (90), the maximum possible overlap is 70. So if all the debate attendees also went to the prom, then the total number attending either would be 90 (since the debate group is entirely within the prom group). Wait, but that might not be possible because the prom has to be at least 90. Wait, let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the minimal possible union is P + D - min(P, D). Wait, no, the maximum possible intersection is the minimum of P and D. So the minimal union would be P + D - (minimum of P and D). Wait, actually, the maximum possible overlap between P and D can't exceed the size of the smaller set. So if D is 70, then the maximum overlap would be 70, so then the union would be P + D - overlap = 90 +70 -70 =90. But is that possible?\n\nWait, but if the prom has 90 and the debate has 70, then the maximum overlap is 70, so the union would be 90. So in that case, the total number of students who went to at least one event is 90, so the number who didn't go to either is 200 -90=110? But that's one of the options, E)110. But wait, the question says \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% took part in the debate\". So maybe those numbers can be higher, but we want the minimal possible union, so the minimal P and D? Wait, no, because the problem says \"at least\", so to minimize the union, we should take the minimal possible P and D. So set P exactly at 45%, which is 90, and D exactly at 35% (70). Then, if their overlap is maximized (so 70), then the union is 90. So the non-participants would be 110. But that's an option here (E). But wait, the options include E)110. But I feel like maybe that's too high. Let me check the options again. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem states \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%, so the minimum possible numbers are 90 and 70. To minimize the total number attending either event, we can set the numbers exactly at those minimums and maximize their overlap. So yes, the maximum overlap is 70 (since D is 70), so the union is 90+70-70=90. So 200-90=110. So the answer would be E)110. But that seems high. Wait, but maybe there's a constraint I'm missing?\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the percentages are given as \"at least\", so maybe the actual numbers can be higher, but to find the maximum possible non-attendees, you need the minimal attendees. So yes, taking the minimal numbers for P and D, and overlapping as much as possible. That gives the minimal union. So the answer would be 110. But the options have E as 110, so that's possible.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read again: \"the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debating session\". So yes, that's the complement of the union. To maximize that, minimize the union. The minimal possible union is when the two groups overlap as much as possible. So yes, that's exactly the case when the debate participants are all part of the prom participants. Then the total is 90. So 200 - 90 is 110. So E is the answer. But why is there an option D as 99? Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentages are 45% and 35%, so 45% of 200 is 90, 35% is 70. To find the minimal number of students in P \u222a D, the minimal is when the intersection is as large as possible. The maximum possible intersection is the minimum of the two, which is 70. So the union is 90 +70 -70 =90. So the number who didn't attend either is 200-90=110. So E) is correct. Hmm. But why is the option C)90? Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Wait 200 - 90 is indeed 110. So E is the answer. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted as \"at least 45% attended the prom\" so maybe you can have more than 45%, but to minimize the union you need to have as few as possible. So the minimal possible is 90 and 70, which is exactly what I did. So that's correct. Then why is the option E there? Maybe the answer is E.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the overlap. Let me see:\n\nThe formula for the union is P + D - intersection. To minimize the union, we need to maximize the intersection. The maximum possible intersection between P and D is the minimum of P and D. Since D is 70, the maximum possible overlap is 70, so yes, the union would be 90. So 200-90=110. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, but let me see another angle. Suppose that the prom is 90 students and the debate is 70. If all 70 debate students are in the prom, then total is 90. So 110 didn't go to either. That's possible. So that's the maximum possible. So the answer is E. But the options given include E as 110, so that's the answer. Maybe the confusion comes from thinking that the percentages can't be exactly 45 and 35, but the problem says \"at least\", so the minimum possible is exactly those numbers. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E)110.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about figuring out the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom or the debate. Let me see. The school has 200 students. At least 45% went to the prom and at least 35% were in the debate. I need to find the maximum possible number who missed both events. Hmm, right.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the maximum number of students who didn't attend either. To maximize the number of students who didn't go to either, I think I need to minimize the number of students who went to at least one of the events. Because the total is fixed at 200, so if fewer went to either, more didn't go. \n\nAlright, so how do I minimize the number of students who went to prom or debate? I remember something about inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for the union of two sets is A + B - A\u2229B. To minimize the total number, I need to maximize the overlap between the two groups. Because the more overlap there is between prom and debate attendees, the smaller the total number of unique attendees. \n\nLet me write that down. Let P be the number who went to prom, D the number in debate. The problem states that at least 45% (so at least 90 students) went to prom, and at least 35% (so 70 students) were in debate. To minimize P \u222a D, we want the intersection P \u2229 D to be as large as possible. \n\nThe maximum possible overlap between P and D would be the smaller of the two groups. Since 35% (70) is less than 45% (90), the maximum possible overlap is 70. So if all the debate attendees also went to the prom, then the total number attending either would be 90 (since the debate group is entirely within the prom group). Wait, but that might not be possible because the prom has to be at least 90. Wait, let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the minimal possible union is P + D - min(P, D). Wait, no, the maximum possible intersection is the minimum of P and D. So the minimal union would be P + D - (minimum of P and D). Wait, actually, the maximum possible overlap between P and D can't exceed the size of the smaller set. So if D is 70, then the maximum overlap would be 70, so then the union would be P + D - overlap = 90 +70 -70 =90. But is that possible?\n\nWait, but if the prom has 90 and the debate has 70, then the maximum overlap is 70, so the union would be 90. So in that case, the total number of students who went to at least one event is 90, so the number who didn't go to either is 200 -90=110? But that's one of the options, E)110. But wait, the question says \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% took part in the debate\". So maybe those numbers can be higher, but we want the minimal possible union, so the minimal P and D? Wait, no, because the problem says \"at least\", so to minimize the union, we should take the minimal possible P and D. So set P exactly at 45%, which is 90, and D exactly at 35% (70). Then, if their overlap is maximized (so 70), then the union is 90. So the non-participants would be 110. But that's an option here (E). But wait, the options include E)110. But I feel like maybe that's too high. Let me check the options again. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The problem states \"at least\" 45% and \"at least\" 35%, so the minimum possible numbers are 90 and 70. To minimize the total number attending either event, we can set the numbers exactly at those minimums and maximize their overlap. So yes, the maximum overlap is 70 (since D is 70), so the union is 90+70-70=90. So 200-90=110. So the answer would be E)110. But that seems high. Wait, but maybe there's a constraint I'm missing?\n\nWait, but another thought: perhaps the percentages are given as \"at least\", so maybe the actual numbers can be higher, but to find the maximum possible non-attendees, you need the minimal attendees. So yes, taking the minimal numbers for P and D, and overlapping as much as possible. That gives the minimal union. So the answer would be 110. But the options have E as 110, so that's possible.\n\nBut wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read again: \"the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debating session\". So yes, that's the complement of the union. To maximize that, minimize the union. The minimal possible union is when the two groups overlap as much as possible. So yes, that's exactly the case when the debate participants are all part of the prom participants. Then the total is 90. So 200 - 90 is 110. So E is the answer. But why is there an option D as 99? Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the percentages are 45% and 35%, so 45% of 200 is 90, 35% is 70. To find the minimal number of students in P \u222a D, the minimal is when the intersection is as large as possible. The maximum possible intersection is the minimum of the two, which is 70. So the union is 90 +70 -70 =90. So the number who didn't attend either is 200-90=110. So E) is correct. Hmm. But why is the option C)90? Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Wait 200 - 90 is indeed 110. So E is the answer. But let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted as \"at least 45% attended the prom\" so maybe you can have more than 45%, but to minimize the union you need to have as few as possible. So the minimal possible is 90 and 70, which is exactly what I did. So that's correct. Then why is the option E there? Maybe the answer is E.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the overlap. Let me see:\n\nThe formula for the union is P + D - intersection. To minimize the union, we need to maximize the intersection. The maximum possible intersection between P and D is the minimum of P and D. Since D is 70, the maximum possible overlap is 70, so yes, the union would be 90. So 200-90=110. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, but let me see another angle. Suppose that the prom is 90 students and the debate is 70. If all 70 debate students are in the prom, then total is 90. So 110 didn't go to either. That's possible. So that's the maximum possible. So the answer is E. But the options given include E as 110, so that's the answer. Maybe the confusion comes from thinking that the percentages can't be exactly 45 and 35, but the problem says \"at least\", so the minimum possible is exactly those numbers. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E)110.\n\n\nTo determine the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debating session, we need to minimize the number of students who attended at least one of the events. The minimum number of students who attended the prom is 45% of 200, which is 90 students, and the minimum for the debating session is 35%, which is 70 students. \n\nTo minimize the total number of students attending either event, we maximize the overlap between the two groups. The maximum overlap occurs when all 70 students in the debating session are also part of the 90 students who attended the prom. This results in a union of \\(90 + 70 - 70 = 90\\) students attending at least one event. \n\nThus, the number of students who attended neither is \\(200 - 90 = 110\\). \n\nAnswer: E",
