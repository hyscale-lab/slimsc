      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here. Let me read it again. The question says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I need to find the number. The options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me break this down. Let me call the number something like x. Yeah, variables are good for unknowns. So let's say the number is x. \n\nThe first part of the problem says, \"If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number...\" So that would be (2/3)x minus 10. Wait, no, actually, the order matters here. It says 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of the number. So that would be (2/3)x minus 10. Wait, no, subtract 10 from (2/3)x. So yes, that's correct. So that expression would be (2/3)x - 10.\n\nThen, the result of that is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. The sum of 40 and (1/3)x. So that's 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nSo putting it all together, the equation is: (2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let me write that equation again:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nHmm, maybe I can subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get the x terms on one side. Let's try that. \n\nSubtracting (1/3)x from both sides gives:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nSimplifying the x terms: (2/3 - 1/3)x is (1/3)x. So now the equation is (1/3)x - 10 = 40.\n\nThen, I can add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with x. \n\n(1/3)x = 40 + 10 \u2192 (1/3)x = 50.\n\nTo solve for x, multiply both sides by 3:\n\nx = 50 * 3 = 150.\n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option C is 150. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me go through the steps again to confirm.\n\nOriginal equation: (2/3)x -10 = 40 + (1/3)x.\n\nSubtract (1/3)x from both sides: (2/3 -1/3)x -10 =40 \u2192 (1/3)x -10 =40.\n\nAdding 10: (1/3)x =50. Multiply by 3 gives x=150. That seems right. So the answer would be C)150?\n\nWait, but let me check with another method to be sure. Let me plug in 150 into the original problem and see if both sides are equal.\n\nFirst, 2/3 of 150 is (2/3)*150 = 100. Subtract 10 gives 90. \n\nOn the other side, sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. 1/3 of 150 is 50. So 40 +50 =90. \n\nYes, both sides are equal. So that works. So 150 is correct, which is option C. \n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option C is 150, so that's the answer. But wait, let me check another option just in case. Maybe I made an error in arithmetic.\n\nWait, let me try option B, 160, just to see. Let's see:\n\n2/3 of 160 is (2/3)*160 = 320/3 \u2248 106.666... Subtract 10 would be 96.666...\n\nThe other side: 40 + (1/3)*160 =40 + ~53.333 = 93.333. Not equal. So that's not matching.\n\nHow about D)210? Let's see:\n\n2/3 of 210 is 140. Subtract 10 gives 130.\n\nOther side: 40 + (1/3)*210 =40 +70=110. Not equal. \n\nE)220: 2/3*220 is ~146.666 minus 10 is ~136.666. Other side 40 + ~73.333 is 113.333. Not equal.\n\nA)100: 2/3*100 is ~66.666 minus 10 is ~56.666. Other side:40 + ~33.333 is 73.333. Not equal. \n\nSo yeah, only 150 works. Therefore, the correct answer must be C.\n",
