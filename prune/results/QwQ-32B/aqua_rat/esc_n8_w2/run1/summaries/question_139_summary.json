      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about two cars, X and Y, and I need to find the difference in their speeds. Let me see. The question says Car X covers 320 km in 8 hours, and Car Y covers 415 km in 5 hours. I need to find the difference between their speeds.\n\nHmm, right, speed is calculated by distance divided by time. So first, I should find the speed of each car individually. Let me start with Car X. The distance is 320 km over 8 hours. So dividing 320 by 8 should give me the speed. Let me do that: 320 divided by 8. Well, 8 times 40 is 320, so that's 40 km/h. Wait, yes, because 8*40=320. So Car X's speed is 40 km/h.\n\nNow for Car Y. It goes 415 km in 5 hours. So that's 415 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 5 times 80 is 400, so 415 minus 400 is 15. So 15 divided by 5 is 3. So adding that to 80 gives 83. So Car Y's speed is 83 km/h? Wait, that seems really fast. Wait, 5 hours for 415 km. Let me check again. 5 times 80 is 400, plus 5*3=15, so yes, 83. Hmm, okay, maybe that's correct. So Y is 83 km/h.\n\nNow the question asks for the difference between the two speeds. So subtract X's speed from Y's? Since Y is faster. 83 minus 40 is 43. So the difference is 43 km/h. Let me look at the options. Option C is 43 km/hr. So that's the answer?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the cars. The problem says \"difference in the speed of the two cars\", so it's absolute value, so it doesn't matter which is subtracted from which. 83 minus 40 is indeed 43. So yes, 43. The options are A)42, B)41, C)43, D)45, E)None. So C is the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations again to be sure.\n\nCar X: 320 /8. 8*40 is 320. Correct. So 40 km/h. Car Y: 415 divided by 5. Let's do 415 divided by 5 step by step. 5 into 41 is 8 (since 5*8=40), remainder 1. Bring down the 5 to make 15. 5 into 15 is 3. So total is 83. Yep, that's right. So 83-40 is 43. So the answer should be C. So the correct option is C. But wait, the options have \"km/hr\" and \"km/hr\"\u2014the first option has \"kms/hr\" but that's probably a typo. Anyway, the numerical value is 43. So the answer is C. Therefore, the correct choice is C.\n",

Wait, yeah, that checks out. 8 hours multiplied by 40 km/h gives exactly 320 km. Cool.\n\nNow, moving on to Car Y. It covers 415 km in 5 hours. Again, using the same formula, speed equals distance over time. So 415 divided by 5. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 5 times 80 is 400, so 415 minus 400 is 15. So that's 80 plus (15/5) which is 3. So 83 km/h. Wait, 5 times 83 is 415? Let me check that again. 80 times 5 is 400, plus 3 times 5 is 15. 400 +15 = 415. Yes, that's correct. So Car Y's speed is 83 km/h.\n\nNow the question asks for the difference in their speeds. So I subtract the slower speed from the faster one. Car Y is 83, Car X is 40. 83 minus 40 is 43. So the difference should be 43 km/h. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 43 km/hr. So the answer should be C.
