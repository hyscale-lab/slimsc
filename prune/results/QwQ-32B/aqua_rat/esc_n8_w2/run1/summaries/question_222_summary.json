      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. Hmm, the problem is about figuring out Ajay's current age based on the relationships given. Alright, let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the problem states: If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, and then the remainder is divided by 18, that gives Rahul's present age. So let me write that as an equation. Let me denote Ajay's age as A and Rahul's age as R. So according to the problem, (A - 6)/18 = R. Got that part.\n\nThen, the next part says Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis's age is 5 years. Wait, Denis's age is 5? Wait, Denis is 5 years old? Because the problem says \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs\". Oh right, so Denis is 5. Then Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age would be Denis's age minus 2. So R = 5 - 2. That makes Rahul 3 years old. Wait, that seems really young. But maybe that's correct. Let me check again. \n\nYes, the problem says Rahul is 2 years younger to Denis, and Denis is 5. So 5 minus 2 is 3. So Rahul is 3. \n\nNow going back to the first equation. Since R is 3, then (A -6)/18 = 3. To find A, I can multiply both sides by 18: A -6 = 3 * 18. Let's calculate that. 3*18 is 54. So A -6 =54. Then adding 6 to both sides gives A = 54 +6 =60. \n\nSo Ajay's age should be 60. Let me check the options. Option B is 60. Hmm, but wait, is there any step I might have messed up?\n\nLet me verify again. Let's plug back in. If Ajay is 60, subtract 6 gives 54. Divided by 18 is 3, which is Rahul's age. And Rahul being 3 is indeed 2 years younger than Denis who's 5. Yeah that all adds up. So the answer must be B)60.\n",
