      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem says that one third of 3/4 of a number is 21, and I need to find the number. Hmm, right. Let me break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me try to translate the words into an equation. The number is unknown, so let's call it x. The problem mentions \"one third of 3/4 of a number.\" Breaking that down: 3/4 of the number would be (3/4)*x. Then, taking one third of that result. So that would be (1/3) multiplied by (3/4)x. And that equals 21. \n\nSo putting that into an equation: (1/3) * (3/4)x = 21. Let me write that out properly. \n\nLet me compute the left side first. Multiplying 1/3 and 3/4. The 3s might cancel out. Let's see: (1/3)*(3/4) = (1*3)/(3*4) = 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4. Oh, right! Because 3 divided by 3 is 1, so it's (1/1)*(1/4) = 1/4. So the equation simplifies to (1/4)x = 21. \n\nWait, so (1/4)x equals 21. To find x, I need to multiply both sides by 4. That would give x = 21 *4. Let me calculate that: 21 times 4 is 84. So x is 84. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 84. So the answer should be A. \n\nBut let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's plug it back in. If the number is 84, then 3/4 of that is (3/4)*84. Let me compute that: 84 divided by 4 is 21, so 21 multiplied by 3 is 63. Then one third of 63 is 63 divided by 3, which is 21. Exactly what the problem states. So that checks out. \n\nHmm, so I think that's correct. The answer should be A)84.\n",

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's call the number we're trying to find \"x\". That makes it easier to set up an equation. So, the problem states that if you take 3/4 of x, and then take one third of that result, you get 21. \n\nBreaking it down: 3/4 of x would be (3/4)*x. Then, one third of that value is (1/3) multiplied by (3/4)*x. So putting that into an equation, it would be (1/3)*(3/4)*x = 21. \n\nWait, let me make sure I got the order right. The question says \"one third of 3/4 of a number\". Yeah, that's correct. So first you take 3/4 of the number, then take one third of that. So the equation is correct as I set it up.\n\nNow let's simplify that equation. Let's multiply the fractions first. (1/3) times (3/4) equals... Well, the 3s should cancel out. 1/3 * 3/4 is (1*3)/(3*4) = 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4. Oh, so the equation simplifies to (1/4)*x =21. \n\nSo (1/4)x =21. To find x, I just need to multiply both sides by 4. That gives x=21*4. 21 times 4 is 84. So the number should be 84, which is option A. \n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's plug it back in. If the number is 84, then 3/4 of that is (3/4)*84.

So that checks out. \n\nSo the answer must be A)84. Let me look at the options again. The options are A through E, with A being 84. Yep, that's correct. I don't think I made any errors here. The steps all line up. The key was setting up the equation correctly and simplifying properly. The cancellation of the 3s was important there. So yeah, definitely option A.\n",
