      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a survey where students picked their two favorite songs from a list of 10. Each song was selected 5 times. We need to find out how many students were surveyed. Hmm, right.\n\nSo each student chose 2 songs. That means each student contributes 2 selections. Let me think. The total number of selections across all songs would be the number of students multiplied by 2, right? Because each student has two choices.\n\nNow, there are 10 songs, and each song was selected 5 times. So the total number of selections is 10 songs multiplied by 5 selections each. Let me calculate that. 10 times 5 is 50. So total selections are 50.\n\nWait, so the total selections from the students' side must equal the total from the songs' side. So the students' total (which is 2 times the number of students) should equal 50. Let me set that up as an equation. Let n be the number of students. Then 2n = 50. Solving for n would be 50 divided by 2, which is 25. So n=25. \n\nWait, but let me check the options. Option D is 25. So that's probably the answer. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.\n\nAnother way to think: Each song got 5 picks. So total picks are 10*5=50. Each student gives 2 picks, so number of students is 50/2 =25. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be D.\n",

We need to find out how many students were surveyed. Hmm, right.\n\nSo first, let me think. Each student chooses 2 songs. That means each student contributes 2 selections. The total number of selections across all students would then be 2 times the number of students. Let me note that down: total selections = 2 * number of students.\n\nOn the other hand, the problem says each of the 10 songs was selected 5 times. So each song has 5 selections. Since there are 10 songs, the total number of selections is also 10 * 5 = 50. Oh right, because every song's count adds up. \n\nSo setting those two expressions equal. The total selections from the students' side must equal the total from the songs' side. So 2*N = 10*5. Let me check that again. \n\nYes, because each student contributes two, so 2N total. The songs each have 5, so 10 songs times 5 is 50. So 2N = 50. Then solving for N gives N = 50 / 2 = 25. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, D is 25. So that's the answer? Let me double-check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here. Like, are the two songs chosen by a student considered as two separate selections, or is there some overlap? But the problem states each song was selected 5 times. So each time a song is chosen by a student, that's a selection. Since each student picks two, the total is indeed 2N. \n\nAnother way: Suppose there are N students. Each has 2 choices, so total votes (selections) are 2N. The total votes must also be the sum over all songs of their counts. Since each song was selected 5 times, 10 songs *5 =50. Therefore 2N=50 \u2192 N=25. So the answer should be D)25. \n\nHmm, the options include 25 as D. So I think that's correct. The other options don't fit. Like 50 divided by 2 is 25. Yeah, I can't see a mistake here.
