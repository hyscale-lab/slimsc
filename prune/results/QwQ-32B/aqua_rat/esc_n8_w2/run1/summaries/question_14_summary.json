      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to add +45 and -30. Hmm, let's see. When you add a positive and a negative number, it's like subtracting the smaller absolute value from the larger one and then taking the sign of the larger. Wait, right. The absolute value of 45 is bigger than 30. So subtract 30 from 45, which gives 15. Since 45 was positive, the result should be positive. So 45 minus 30 is 15. So the answer should be +15. Let me check the options. Option D is 15, which is positive. So D must be the correct answer. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. Adding +45 and -30 is the same as 45 -30, which is definitely 15. Yep, D is right.\n",
