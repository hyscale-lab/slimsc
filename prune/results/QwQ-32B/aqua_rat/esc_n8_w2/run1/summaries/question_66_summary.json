      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about a rectangular piece of land with an area of 150 square meters. The length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. We need to find the perimeter. Alright, let's start by recalling the formulas for area and perimeter of a rectangle. \n\nThe area of a rectangle is length multiplied by breadth, right? So, Area = L \u00d7 B. The perimeter is 2 times (length plus breadth). So Perimeter = 2(L + B). \n\nThe problem states that the length is 1m more than four times the breadth. Let me write that down as an equation. Let me denote the breadth as B. Then the length L would be 4B + 1. Because four times the breadth plus 1 meter.\n\nSo substituting that into the area equation: L \u00d7 B = 150. Since L is 4B +1, then substituting gives (4B + 1) * B = 150. Let's expand that: 4B\u00b2 + B = 150. \n\nHmm, that gives a quadratic equation. Let me rearrange it to standard form. 4B\u00b2 + B - 150 = 0. Now I need to solve for B. Quadratic equations can be solved using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is ax\u00b2 + bx + c =0, so here a=4, b=1, c= -150. \n\nThe quadratic formula is B = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Plugging in the numbers: \n\nDiscriminant D = (1)^2 -4*4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401. The square root of 2401 is 49, since 49*49 is 2401. \n\nSo the solutions are B = [ -1 \u00b149 ]/(8). Let's calculate both possibilities. \n\nFirst, the positive one: (-1 +49)/8 =48/8 =6. The other solution is (-1-49)/8= -50/8 which is -6.25. Since breadth can't be negative, we take the positive solution. So B=6 meters. \n\nThen the length L is 4*6 +1 =24 +1 =25 meters. \n\nNow, perimeter is 2*(L+B) = 2*(25 +6) =2*(31)=62 meters. Wait, but let me check the options again. The options given are A)60, B)61, C)62, D)63, E)64. So 62 is option C. \n\nBut wait, let me verify my calculations again to be sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me check the area: 25 *6 is indeed 150, so that's correct. The perimeter calculation: 25+6 is 31, multiplied by 2 is 62. That's right. \n\nHmm, but let me make sure I didn't make an error in solving the quadratic equation. Let me re-calculate the discriminant again. 1 squared is 1, 4ac is 4*4*(-150) which is 16*-150 = -2400. So the discriminant is 1 - (-2400*4?), wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, the discriminant formula is b\u00b2-4ac. Here, a is 4, b is 1, c is -150. So 4ac is 4*4*(-150) = 16*(-150)= -2400. So the discriminant is 1 - (4*4*(-150))? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is b\u00b2 -4ac. So 1 - (4*4*(-150))? Wait, no, no. Let me re-calculate that again. \n\nWait, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So substituting the values:\n\nb squared is 1\u00b2 =1. \n\n4ac is 4 *4 (since a=4) * (-150) (since c=-150). So 4*4=16, 16*(-150)= -2400. \n\nSo D = 1 - ( -2400 )? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is b\u00b2 -4ac. So it's 1 - (4*4*(-150))? Wait, no. Wait, 4ac is (4)*(4)*(-150) = 16*(-150) = -2400. Then the discriminant is 1 - (-2400)? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is b\u00b2 minus 4ac. Since 4ac is -2400, then subtracting that would be adding 2400. So D =1 - ( -2400 )? Wait, no, no. Wait, 4ac is 4*4*(-150). Let me compute 4*4 is 16, 16*(-150) is -2400. So the discriminant is 1 - (-2400) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is b\u00b2 - (4ac). Since 4ac is negative, subtracting a negative becomes adding. So yes. So D = 1 - (4ac) = 1 - ( -2400 ) = 1 +2400 =2401. That's correct. So sqrt(2401)=49. So the roots are correct. \n\nSo B is 6, then L is 25. Perimeter is 2*(25+6)=62. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)60, B)61, C)62, D)63, E)64. So yes, C is 62. That's the correct answer. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me check that again. The problem says the length is 1m more than 4 times the breadth. So length = 4*B +1. So that part is correct. Then area is L*B= (4B+1)*B =4B\u00b2 + B =150. Which gives the equation 4B\u00b2 + B -150 =0. All correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this problem. Let's see. Maybe trial and error with the options? But since the quadratic approach worked, I think that's solid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question? Like, maybe the perimeter is in different units? But the problem says the area is 150 sq m, so the units are meters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated the perimeter. Let me see again. Length 25, breadth 6. Perimeter is 2*(25+6)=2*(31)=62. Yep. \n\nHmm, so I think that's correct. So the answer is C.\n",

Plugging in the numbers: \n\nDiscriminant D = (1)^2 -4*4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 = 2401. The square root of 2401 is 49, since 49*49 is 2401. \n\nSo the solutions are B = [ -1 \u00b149 ]/(8). Let's calculate both possibilities. \n\nFirst, the positive one: (-1 +49)/8 =48/8 =6. The other solution is (-1-49)/8= -50/8 which is -6.25.

Wait, the discriminant formula is b\u00b2-4ac. Here, a is 4, b is 1, c is -150. So 4ac is 4*4*(-150) = 16*(-150)= -2400. So the discriminant is 1 - (4*4*(-150))? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is b\u00b2 -4ac. So 1 - (4*4*(-150))? Wait, no, no. Let me re-calculate that again. \n\nWait, discriminant D = b\u00b2 -4ac. So substituting the values:\n\nb squared is 1\u00b2 =1. \n\n4ac is 4 *4 (since a=4) * (-150) (since c=-150). So 4*4=16, 16*(-150)= -2400. \n\nSo D = 1 - ( -2400 )? Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is b\u00b2 -4ac. So it's 1 - (4*4*(-150))? Wait, no. Wait, 4ac is (4)*(4)*(-150) = 16*(-150) = -2400. Then the discriminant is 1 - (-2400)? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is b\u00b2 minus 4ac. Since 4ac is -2400, then subtracting that would be adding 2400. So D =1 - ( -2400 )? Wait, no, no. Wait, 4ac is 4*4*(-150). Let me compute 4*4 is 16, 16*(-150) is -2400. So the discriminant is 1 - (-2400) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the formula is b\u00b2 - (4ac). Since 4ac is negative, subtracting a negative becomes adding. So yes. So D = 1 - (4ac) = 1 - ( -2400 ) = 1 +2400 =2401. That's correct. So sqrt(2401)=49. So the roots are correct. \n\nSo B is 6, then L is 25. Perimeter is 2*(25+6)=62.

Then, according to the problem, the length would be 4 times the breadth plus 1. So, length (l) = 4b + 1. Got that part.\n\nNow, the area is l * b = 150. Substituting the expression for l into that equation gives me (4b +1) * b = 150. Let me write that out: 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. Wait, actually, expanding that, it's (4b +1) * b = 4b\u00b2 + b. So the equation is 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. To solve for b, I need to rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation. Subtract 150 from both sides: 4b\u00b2 + b - 150 = 0.\n\nNow, solving this quadratic equation. Let me see if I can factor it or if I need to use the quadratic formula. Let's try factoring first. The quadratic is 4b\u00b2 + b -150. To factor this, I need two numbers that multiply to (4 * -150) = -600 and add up to 1. Hmm, that's a bit tricky. Let me think... 25 and -24? 25 * -24 = -600, and 25 + (-24) = 1. Yes, that works! So, splitting the middle term:\n\n4b\u00b2 +25b -24b -150 =0\n\nGroup the first two and last two terms:\n\n(4b\u00b2 +25b) + (-24b -150) =0\n\nFactor out common terms from each group:\n\nb(4b +25) -6(4b +25) =0\n\nWait, let me check that again.

So the common factor is (4b +25). So factoring:\n\n(b -6)(4b +25) = 0? Wait, wait. Wait, the grouping gives:\n\nb(4b +25) -6(4b +25) = (b -6)(4b +25) =0.\n\nSo setting each factor equal to zero:\n\nEither b -6 =0 \u2192 b=6, or 4b +25 =0 \u2192 b = -25/4. But since breadth can't be negative, we discard that. So b=6 meters.\n\nWait, let me check this again. Let me plug b=6 back into the original equation to confirm. The length would be 4*6 +1 =25. Then area is 25 *6=150, which matches. Okay, that works. So breadth is 6, length is 25.\n\nNow, the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth). So substituting the values: 2*(25 +6)=2*(31)=62 meters. Hmm, but looking at the options, option C is 62. But wait, let me double-check everything because sometimes I might make a mistake in the calculation.\n\nWait another thought: Let me check the quadratic equation again. Let me see:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution: 4b\u00b2 + b =150 \u2192 4b\u00b2 +b -150=0. \n\nWhen I split the middle term as 25b -24b, that gives:\n\n4b\u00b2 +25b -24b -150 =0. Then grouping as (4b\u00b2 +25b) and (-24b -150). \n\nFactoring the first group: b*(4b +25). The second group: -6*(4b +25). Wait, because -24b is -6*4b and -150 is -6*25. So yes, so factoring gives (b -6)(4b +25). So yes, solution is b=6. \n\nSo length is 25, so perimeter is 2*(25+6)=2*31=62. So the answer should be C)62 m.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options given are A)60, B)61, C)62, D)63, E)64. So 62 is option C. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the quadratic solution? Let me try using the quadratic formula to confirm.\n\nQuadratic equation is 4b\u00b2 +b -150 =0. The quadratic formula is b = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 -4AC)]/(2A). Here, A=4, B=1, C=-150. \n\nDiscriminant D = 1^2 -4*4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 =2401. Square root of 2401 is 49. \n\nSo, b = [ -1 \u00b149 ]/(8). \n\nTaking the positive solution: (-1 +49)/8 =48/8=6. So that's the same answer. So yes, correct. \n\nSo the perimeter is 2*(25+6)=62. So the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm, but let me think again why I might be confused. Sometimes, maybe I miscalculated the perimeter? Let me re-calculate: 25+6 is 31, times 2 is 62. Yep. That's correct. So the answer is C.\n",

Let me see:\n\nOriginal equation after substitution: 4b\u00b2 + b =150 \u2192 4b\u00b2 +b -150=0. \n\nWhen I split the middle term as 25b -24b, that gives:\n\n4b\u00b2 +25b -24b -150 =0. Then grouping as (4b\u00b2 +25b) and (-24b -150). \n\nFactoring the first group: b*(4b +25). The second group: -6*(4b +25). Wait, because -24b is -6*4b and -150 is -6*25. So yes, so factoring gives (b -6)(4b +25). So yes, solution is b=6. \n\nSo length is 25, so perimeter is 2*(25+6)=2*31=62. So the answer should be C)62 m.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options given are A)60, B)61, C)62, D)63, E)64. So 62 is option C. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the quadratic solution? Let me try using the quadratic formula to confirm.\n\nQuadratic equation is 4b\u00b2 +b -150 =0. The quadratic formula is b = [-B \u00b1 sqrt(B\u00b2 -4AC)]/(2A). Here, A=4, B=1, C=-150. \n\nDiscriminant D = 1^2 -4*4*(-150) = 1 + 2400 =2401. Square root of 2401 is 49. \n\nSo, b = [ -1 \u00b149 ]/(8). \n\nTaking the positive solution: (-1 +49)/8 =48/8=6. So that's the same answer. So yes, correct. \n\nSo the perimeter is 2*(25+6)=62. So the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm, but let me think again why I might be confused. Sometimes, maybe I miscalculated the perimeter? Let me re-calculate: 25+6 is 31, times 2 is 62. Yep. That's correct. So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the breadth be \\( b \\) meters. The length is given as \\( 4b + 1 \\) meters. The area of the rectangle is \\( 150 \\, \\text{m}^2 \\), leading to the equation:\n\n\\[\n(4b + 1) \\cdot b = 150\n\\]\n\nExpanding and rearranging terms:\n\n\\[\n4b^2 + b - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( b = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \\), where \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), and \\( C = -150 \\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 2400}}{8} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 49}{8}\n\\]\n\nTaking the positive root (since breadth cannot be negative):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{48}{8} = 6 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThe length is then:\n\n\\[\n4(6) + 1 = 25 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is:\n\n\\[\n2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{breadth}) = 2 \\times (25 + 6) = 2 \\times 31 = 62 \\, \\text{m}\n\\]\n\nAnswer: C",
