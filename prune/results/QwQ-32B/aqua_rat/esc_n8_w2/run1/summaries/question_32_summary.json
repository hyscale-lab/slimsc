      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about converting a map distance to actual miles. Hmm. The map shows the road from Town F to G as 20 inches. And the scale is 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. I need to find out the real distance.\n\nFirst, I remember that scale conversions work by figuring out how many units on the map correspond to real units. So the scale here is 1/4 inch = 10 miles. Wait, maybe I should find out how many miles one inch represents. Because if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then multiplying both by 4 would give me the miles per inch. Let me do that calculation.\n\nSo, 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. To get 1 inch, I multiply both sides by 4. That would be 1 inch equals 10 *4 =40 miles. Oh right, so each inch on the map is 40 actual miles. \n\nNow the road is 20 inches long on the map. So the actual distance would be 20 inches multiplied by 40 miles per inch. Let me compute that. 20 times 40 is 800. Wait, that would make the answer 800 miles, which is option A. \n\nBut let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the conversion. Let's see: 1/4 inch is 10 miles. So per inch, it's 10 divided by (1/4), which is 10 *4 =40. Yeah that's correct. Then 20 inches would be 20 *40. 20 times 40 is indeed 800. So the answer should be A)800. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another way: how many quarter inches are in 20 inches? Since each quarter is 1/4, the number is 20 divided by (1/4), which is 20 *4 =80. Each of those quarter inches is 10 miles, so 80 *10 =800. Yep, same result. So the answer is A.\n",

The problem says that on the map, the road is 20 inches long. And the scale is 1/4 inch representing 10 miles. Hmm, right, scales can sometimes be tricky because you have to convert the fractions properly.\n\nFirst, maybe I should find out how many quarter inches are in 20 inches. Because each quarter inch is 10 miles. So if I can find out how many 1/4 inches there are in 20 inches, then multiply that by 10 miles, that should give the actual distance.\n\nWait, how do I calculate how many 1/4 inches are in 20 inches? Oh right, dividing by the fraction. Like, 20 divided by (1/4) would be the same as 20 multiplied by 4, right? Because dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal. So that would be 20 *4 =80. So there are 80 quarter inches in 20 inches.\n\nThen each of those quarter inches is 10 miles, so 80 times 10 equals... 800 miles. So the answer should be 800, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think of the scale another way. The scale is 1/4 inch = 10 miles.
