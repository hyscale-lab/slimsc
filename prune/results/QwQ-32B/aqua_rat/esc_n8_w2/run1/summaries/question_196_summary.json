      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the electric pole and the tree. Let's see. The question says that an electric pole that's 14 meters high casts a shadow of 10 meters. Then they want to find the height of a tree that casts a 15-meter shadow under the same conditions. Hmm, right, this sounds like a proportion problem because the shadows and heights should be proportional if the conditions are the same, like the angle of the sun.\n\nSo, the idea is that the ratio of the height to the shadow length for the pole should be the same as that for the tree. Let me write that down. Let me denote the height of the tree as h. Then the proportion would be:\n\nHeight of pole / Shadow of pole = Height of tree / Shadow of tree\n\nPlugging in the numbers: 14 / 10 = h / 15. \n\nTo solve for h, I can cross-multiply. So 14 times 15 equals 10 times h. Let me compute 14*15. Hmm, 14*10 is 140, and 14*5 is 70, so adding those gives 210. So 210 = 10h. Then dividing both sides by 10 gives h = 21. \n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me check again. The ratio of height to shadow is the same. So 14/10 simplifies to 1.4. Then the tree's ratio should also be 1.4. So 1.4 times 15 (since h/shadow is 1.4, so h = 1.4*15). Let's calculate that: 15*1 is 15, 15*0.4 is 6, so total 21. Yep, that matches. \n\nLooking at the options, 21 is option A. So the answer should be A. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up the ratios. Like, maybe I did shadow over height instead? Wait, no, the key is that the ratio of the object's height to its shadow should be the same because the sun's angle is the same. So if the pole is taller relative to its shadow, the tree must be the same. Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles here. The triangles formed by the objects and their shadows are similar, so the sides are proportional. \n\nAlternatively, maybe set up as shadow over height? Let me see. If I did 10/14 = 15/h, then cross-multiplying would give 10h = 14*15 again. Wait no, that's the same as before. Wait, no. Wait, if it was shadow over height, then 10/14 =15/h, so cross multiply 10h = 14*15, same equation. So solving h would still be 210/10 =21. So either way, same result. So the answer is 21. So option A.\n",
