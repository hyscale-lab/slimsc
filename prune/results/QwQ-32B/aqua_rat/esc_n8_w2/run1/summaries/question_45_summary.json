      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here from Daifu University. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the percentage of all students who are members of the swim team. The given information is that 24% of all students are in both the chess club and the swim team. Also, 20% of the members of the swim team are not in the chess club. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.\n\nAlright, let me think. Let's denote some variables to make this clearer. Let me call the total number of students as, say, 100 for simplicity. Because percentages are involved, using 100 students will make calculations easier. \n\nSo, total students = 100. Then, 24% of them are in both chess and swim. That means 24 students are in both. Now, the second part says 20% of the members of the swim team are not in the chess club. Wait, that's about the swim team members. Let me parse that again. \n\nThe swim team has some members. Out of those members, 20% are only in the swim team (not chess), and the remaining 80% must be in both. Because if 20% are not in chess, then the rest (100% - 20% =80%) are in both. Wait, but the 24% given earlier is the percentage of all students in both. So, perhaps I need to relate these two pieces of information.\n\nLet me denote S as the total percentage of students in the swim team. The problem is asking for S. \n\nWe know that 20% of S are only in the swim team, and 80% of S are in both. But the 80% of S is equal to the 24% of all students. Because the overlap between chess and swim (both) is 24% of all students, which is the same as 80% of the swim team members. \n\nSo, in equation form: 0.80 * S = 24%. \n\nBecause 80% of the swim team members are in both, and that's exactly the 24% of the total students. So solving for S would give me S = 24 / 0.8. Let me calculate that. 24 divided by 0.8 is 30. Wait, 0.8 times 30 is 24. So S would be 30%. \n\nBut wait, let me check again. Let me think in terms of numbers. Suppose there are 100 students. \n\nTotal in both: 24 students. \n\nLet the total number in the swim team be S students (so S is the percentage here since total students are 100). \n\nOf those S students, 20% are only in swim, so 0.2*S are only swim, and 0.8*S are in both. But the both category is 24. So 0.8*S =24. \n\nSolving for S: S = 24 /0.8 =30. So that would mean the swim team is 30 students, so 30% of the total. So the answer would be B)30%. \n\nHmm, but let me make sure I didn't make any wrong assumptions. Let me see another way. The problem states that 20% of the swim team members are not in chess. So the 24% is the overlap. So the swim team has two parts: those in both and those only in swim. The \"only swim\" is 20% of the entire swim team. So, if the swim team has, say, S members, then 0.2S are only swim, and 0.8S are both. But the both part is 24% of all students, so 0.8S =24. Hence S=30. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be B)30%.\n",
