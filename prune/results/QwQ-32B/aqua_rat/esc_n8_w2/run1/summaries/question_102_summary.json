      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about an arithmetic progression (AP) where the common difference is 3 months. The youngest member is 7 years old, and the sum of all members' ages is 250. We need to find the number of members. \n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of an AP is given by the formula S_n = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference. But wait, the units here are mixed. The common difference is in months, while the ages are in years. Oh right, I need to convert the common difference to years to keep the units consistent. Since 3 months is a quarter of a year, that's 0.25 years. \n\nSo, a = 7 years, d = 0.25 years. The sum S_n is given as 250. Plugging into the formula: 250 = n/2 [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]. Let me write that out properly. \n\nLet me compute the terms inside the brackets first. 2a would be 14. Then (n-1)*0.25. So the entire bracket becomes 14 + 0.25(n-1). \n\nSo the equation is 250 = (n/2) * [14 + 0.25(n-1)]. Let me simplify this equation. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 500 = n[14 + 0.25(n-1)]. \n\nExpanding the terms inside the bracket: 14 + 0.25n - 0.25. That simplifies to 13.75 + 0.25n. Wait, 14 minus 0.25 is 13.75, right? So the equation becomes 500 = n*(0.25n +13.75). \n\nHmm, maybe I should rearrange this into a quadratic equation. Let's multiply through:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n = 500\n\nSubtract 500 from both sides:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0 \n\nTo make this easier, multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 =0 ?\n\nWait, let me check that multiplication again. \n\n0.25n\u00b2 *4 = n\u00b2. \n\n13.75n *4 is 55n. \n\n-500 *4 is -2000. Yes. So the equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0. \n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the equation after multiplying by 4 would be 4*(0.25n\u00b2) = n\u00b2, 4*(13.75n) is 55n, and 4*(-500) is -2000? Wait, no. Wait the original equation after moving 500 over was 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500=0. Multiply each term by 4: 0.25n\u00b2*4 =n\u00b2, 13.75n*4=55n, and -500*4 is -2000. So yes, equation is n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0.\n\nHmm, solving quadratic equation n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. Let me use the quadratic formula. \n\nn = [ -55 \u00b1 sqrt(55\u00b2 +4*1*2000) ]/(2*1). \n\nCalculating discriminant: 55 squared is 3025. 4*1*2000 is 8000. So discriminant is 3025 +8000 = 11025. \n\nSquare root of 11025. Hmm, 105 squared is 11025 (since 100\u00b2 is 10000, 105\u00b2=11025). So sqrt(11025)=105. \n\nThus, n = [ -55 \u00b1 105 ]/2. We can ignore the negative solution because n can't be negative. \n\nSo positive solution: ( -55 +105 ) /2 =50/2=25. \n\nSo n=25. Wait, so option C)25 is the answer? Let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nWait let's verify the calculation with n=25. Let's plug back into the sum formula. \n\nSum S = 25/2 [ 2*7 + (25-1)*0.25 ]\n\nFirst, compute 2*7 =14. \n\nThen (24)*0.25 =6. So 14 +6 =20. \n\nThen the sum is (25/2)*20 =25 *10 =250. Exactly matches the given sum. So that works. \n\nHmm, but wait the options include 25 as option C. So that's correct. \n\nWait but let me check if I made a mistake in the equation setup. The common difference is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. The first term is 7. The nth term would be 7 + (n-1)*0.25. \n\nSo the sum formula is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the quadratic equation steps? Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying by 2: 500 = n*(14 +0.25(n-1))\n\nExpanding the bracket: 14 +0.25n -0.25 =13.75 +0.25n. \n\nSo 500 =n*(0.25n +13.75)\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate decimals: 2000 =n*(n +55). \n\nWait, 0.25n *4 is n, and 13.75 *4 is 55. So yes, 4*(0.25n +13.75) = n +55. \n\nSo equation becomes n(n +55) =2000 \u2192 n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. Which is the same as before. \n\nSo solving gives n=25. So yes, answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check another possible mistake. The question says \"sum of the ages of all the members is 250\"\u2014 is that in years? Yes, because the ages are in years. So the sum is 250 years. \n\nSo the setup is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be C)25. Looking at the options, that's one of them. So I think that's correct.\n",

The youngest is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. We need to find the number of members. Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum S of n terms is given by S = n/2 * [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term and d the common difference. Alternatively, it can also be written as S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an the last term. \n\nWait, here, the first term a is the youngest member's age, which is 7 years. The common difference d is 3 months. Oh right, but the ages are in years, so I need to convert the difference to years. Since 3 months is a quarter of a year, that's 0.25 years. So d = 0.25.\n\nThe sum is 250. Let me write down the variables:\n\na = 7 years (the first term)\nd = 0.25 years\nSum S = 250\nn = number of terms (members), which we need to find.\n\nPlugging into the sum formula:\n\n250 = n/2 [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nLet me compute the terms inside the brackets first. 2*7 is 14. Then (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n - 0.25. So adding them together gives 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nLet's rearrange this into a quadratic equation:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0\n\nHmm, maybe multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n4*(0.25n\u00b2) = n\u00b2, 4*13.75n =55n, 4*(-500) = -2000.\n\nSo the equation is:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\nNow I need to solve for n here.

Yes, sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/2. We can ignore the negative solution because n must be positive. So:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 =50/2=25. \n\nWait, so n is 25?

Yes, that works. So n is 25. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25. So the answer should be C?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the common difference conversion. Wait, the common difference is 3 months. So each term is 3 months older than the previous. So the ages would be 7, 7.25, 7.5, 7.75, etc., each time adding 0.25 years. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the sum with n=25. Let me compute the sum using the formula again. \n\nSum S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nn=25, a=7, d=0.25.\n\nSo 2a is 14. (n-1)*d =24 *0.25 =6. So total inside the bracket is 14+6=20. \n\nThen S=25/2 *20 = 25 *10 =250. Exactly the given sum. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer is C)25. \n\nWait, but let me check if any other options might fit. Let's see the options are 18, 20,25,26,27.

Quadratic equation: n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2-4ac)]/(2a)\n\nHere a=1, b=55, c= -2000.\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 + 8000 = 11025.\n\nSquare root of 11025: Let me think. 105 squared is 11025 (since 100\u00b2=10000, 105\u00b2=11025). Yes, sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo n = [-55 \u00b1105]/2. We can ignore the negative solution because n must be positive. So:\n\nn = (-55 +105)/2 =50/2=25. \n\nWait, so n is 25? Let me check that again. \n\nWait, let's plug n=25 back into the equation to confirm.\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying by 4: n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0\n\n25 squared is 625. 55*25 is 1375. 625 +1375 = 2000. 2000 -2000 =0. Yes, that works. So n is 25. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 25. So the answer should be C?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the common difference conversion. Wait, the common difference is 3 months. So each term is 3 months older than the previous. So the ages would be 7, 7.25, 7.5, 7.75, etc., each time adding 0.25 years. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the sum with n=25. Let me compute the sum using the formula again. \n\nSum S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nn=25, a=7, d=0.25.\n\nSo 2a is 14. (n-1)*d =24 *0.25 =6. So total inside the bracket is 14+6=20. \n\nThen S=25/2 *20 = 25 *10 =250. Exactly the given sum. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer is C)25. \n\nWait, but let me check if any other options might fit. Let's see the options are 18, 20,25,26,27. The quadratic gave exactly 25, so that's the right one. \n\nI think that's solid. So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic progression (A.P.). The given parameters are:\n- First term (\\(a\\)) = 7 years (youngest member's age)\n- Common difference (\\(d\\)) = 3 months = 0.25 years\n- Sum of ages (\\(S\\)) = 250\n- Number of terms (\\(n\\)) = ?\n\nThe sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of an A.P. is given by:\n\\[\nS = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[2a + (n-1)d\\right]\n\\]\nSubstituting the known values:\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[2(7) + (n-1)(0.25)\\right]\n\\]\nSimplify the equation:\n\\[\n250 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left[14 + 0.25(n - 1)\\right]\n\\]\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\\[\n500 = n \\left[14 + 0.25n - 0.25\\right]\n\\]\n\\[\n500 = n \\left[13.75 + 0.25n\\right]\n\\]\nRearrange into a quadratic equation:\n\\[\n0.25n^2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\\]\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate decimals:\n\\[\nn^2 + 55n - 2000 = 0\n\\]\nSolve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\nHere, \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = 55\\), and \\(c = -2000\\):\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 \\pm \\sqrt{55^2 - 4(1)(-2000)}}{2(1)}\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 \\pm \\sqrt{3025 + 8000}}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nn = \\frac{-55 \\pm 105}{2}\n\\]\nTaking the positive root:\n\\[\nn = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n\\]\nVerification shows the solution satisfies the original equation. Thus, the number of members is 25.\n\nAnswer: C",
