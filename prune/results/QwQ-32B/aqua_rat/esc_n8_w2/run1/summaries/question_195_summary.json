      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about three bells ringing at different intervals and I need to find out when they'll all ring together again. Let me think. The intervals are 36, 40, and 48 seconds. Hmm, right. The question is asking for the next time they all coincide. I remember that when things happen at regular intervals, the time they coincide again is the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals. Yeah, LCM makes sense here because that's the smallest number that all three intervals divide into.\n\nFirst, I need to find the LCM of 36, 40, and 48. To do that, maybe I should break each number down into their prime factors. Let's start with 36. Breaking down 36: 36 divided by 2 is 18, again by 2 is 9, then 3 times 3. So that's 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2. \n\nNext, 40. 40 divided by 2 is 20, then 10, then 5. So that's 2\u00b3 \u00d7 5\u00b9. \n\nThen 48. Let's see, 48 divided by 2 is 24, then 12, 6, 3. So that's 2\u2074 \u00d7 3\u00b9. \n\nNow, the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present. So for 2, the highest exponent is 4 from 48. For 3, the highest is 2 from 36. And there's a 5 from 40. So LCM = 2\u2074 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5. \n\nCalculating that: 2\u2074 is 16, 3\u00b2 is 9. 16 \u00d7 9 is 144. Then 144 \u00d7 5 is 720. So the LCM is 720 seconds. \n\nWait, the options are in minutes. Let me convert 720 seconds to minutes. Since 60 seconds are a minute, 720 divided by 60 is 12. So that's 12 minutes. \n\nLooking at the options, B is after 12 minutes. But hold on, let me double-check my calculations. \n\nLet me verify the LCM again. Maybe I made a mistake in the factors. Let's see:\n\n36 factors: 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2. 40 is 2\u00b3\u00d75. 48 is 2\u2074\u00d73. So the LCM takes the max exponents: 2\u2074, 3\u00b2, and 5. So yes, that's 16\u00d79\u00d75. 16\u00d79 is indeed 144. 144\u00d75 is 720. 720 seconds divided by 60 is 12 minutes. So option B should be correct. \n\nBut wait, the options include E) none. Maybe I made an error? Let me check another way. Suppose I list the multiples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the LCM is correct. Let me see: 36, 40, 48. Let me see if 720 is divisible by all three. \n\n36 \u00d7 20 is 720. 40 \u00d7 18 is 720. 48 \u00d7 15 is 720. Yep, so all divide into 720. So the answer should be 12 minutes, which is option B. So the answer is B. The options don't have any other time that's 12 minutes. So I think the correct answer is B. Therefore, the answer must be B.\n",

Because the LCM of their intervals would give the next time they all coincide.\n\nSo first, I need to find the LCM of 36, 40, and 48. But how do I calculate that again? Oh right, the LCM of multiple numbers can be found by breaking them into their prime factors and taking the highest power of each prime number involved.\n\nLet me factor each number:\n\n36: Let's see, 36 divided by 2 is 18, again by 2 is 9. Then 9 is 3 squared. So 36 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2.\n\n40: 40 divided by 2 four times gives 5, so that's 2\u00b3 \u00d7 5\u00b9.\n\n48: Divided by 2 six times? Wait, no. 48 divided by 2 is 24, then 12, 6, 3. So that's 2^4 \u00d7 3^1. Because 2^4 is 16, but 16*3 is 48, right?\n\nSo the primes involved are 2, 3, and 5. The highest exponents for each:\n\n- For 2: the highest exponent is 4 (from 48's 2^4)\n- For 3: the highest is 2 (from 36's 3\u00b2)\n- For 5: it's 1 (from 40's 5^1)\n\nSo LCM is 2^4 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5^1.
