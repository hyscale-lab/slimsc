      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about the telephone bill which has a fixed part and a variable part depending on the number of calls. The question gives two scenarios: when 540 calls cost 1800 rupees and 620 calls cost 2040. Then they want to know what the bill would be for 500 calls. Hmm, right, this sounds like a linear equation problem. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when something is partly fixed and partly varies with usage, the total cost can be represented as y = mx + b, where m is the variable cost per unit, x is the number of units (calls here), and b is the fixed cost. So the problem is to find m and b first, then plug in x=500.\n\nLet me write down the equations based on the given data. \n\nFirst scenario: 540 calls, total bill 1800. So equation 1 is 1800 = m*540 + b.\n\nSecond scenario: 620 calls, 2040. Equation 2: 2040 = m*620 + b.\n\nNow I need to solve these two equations to find m and b. Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate b. \n\n2040 - 1800 = (m*620 + b) - (m*540 + b)\n240 = m*(620-540)\n240 = m*80\nSo m = 240 /80 = 3. Wait, so the variable cost per call is 3 rupees?\n\nWait, let me check that again. 620-540 is 80, and the difference in cost is 240. So 240 divided by 80 is indeed 3. That seems right. \n\nNow, substitute back to find b. Let's take equation 1: 1800 = 3*540 + b. \n\n3*540 is 1620. So 1800 - 1620 = 180. So b is 180. So the fixed cost is 180 rupees.\n\nSo the formula is total cost = 3x + 180.\n\nNow, for 500 calls, plug in x=500. 3*500 = 1500. Add the fixed 180 gives 1680. Let me check the options. Option B is 1680. So that should be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me confirm with the second equation. If m=3 and b=180, then 620 calls would be 3*620 +180. 3*620 is 1860, plus 180 is 2040, which matches the given value. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, 500 calls would indeed be 3*500 = 1500 + 180 = 1680. So the answer should be B.\n",

The question gives two scenarios: when there are 540 calls, the bill is 1800 rupees, and when there are 620 calls, it's 2040. Then they ask for the bill when 500 calls are made. Alright, I need to find the fixed cost and the variable cost per call first.\n\nLet me recall, this is a linear equation problem. The total bill (let's call it T) is equal to the fixed cost (F) plus the variable cost per call (V) multiplied by the number of calls (N). So the formula would be T = F + V*N.\n\nWe have two data points here. Let me set up two equations. \n\nFirst scenario: 540 calls, total 1800. So equation 1: 1800 = F + 540V.\n\nSecond scenario: 620 calls, total 2040. Equation 2: 2040 = F + 620V.\n\nNow I need to solve these two equations to find F and V. Let me subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate F. \n\n2040 - 1800 = (F +620V) - (F +540V)\n240 = 80V\nSo V = 240 / 80 = 3. Wait, that gives V as 3 rupees per call. \n\nThen plugging back into equation 1 to find F. Let's see: 1800 = F + 540*3. \n\nCalculating 540*3: 500*3=1500, 40*3=120 \u2192 total 1620. So F = 1800 - 1620 = 180. So fixed cost is 180, variable is 3 per call.\n\nNow, the third scenario is 500 calls. So the total would be F +500V. Plugging in the numbers: 180 + 500*3. 500*3 is 1500, plus 180 is 1680. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 1680. So the answer should be B. Wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure. \n\nWait, let me confirm the equations again. \n\nFirst equation: 1800 = F +540V. Second equation 2040 = F +620V. Subtract the first from the second gives 240 = 80V \u2192 V=3. Then F = 1800 -540*3. 540*3 is indeed 1620, so F is 180. Then for 500 calls: 180 + (500*3)=180+1500=1680. Yes, that's correct. The options have B as 1680. So I think that's the right answer.\n",
