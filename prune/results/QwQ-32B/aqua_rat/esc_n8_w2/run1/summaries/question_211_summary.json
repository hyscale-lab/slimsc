      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so Mr. Sam takes 17 hours when he goes by train and returns by car. But if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. We need to find out how long he would take if he went both ways by car. \n\nLet me think. Let's denote some variables here. Maybe let the time taken by train one way be T, and by car be C. So the first scenario is going by train and returning by car, which totals T + C = 17 hours. \n\nThe second scenario is both ways by train. The problem says he loses 4 hours in this case. Wait, losing 4 hours compared to what? Probably compared to the first scenario? Wait, no. Wait, maybe the \"loses 4 hours\" means that the total time for both ways by train is 4 hours more than the original 17? Or maybe compared to going and returning by car? Hmm, I need to parse that again.\n\nThe problem says: \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" The wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again. The first trip is 17 hours for train there and car back. Then, if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. So maybe the total time for both ways by train is 4 hours more than the 17? Because that would make sense. Like, the original trip (train + car) took 17. If he takes train both ways, that's T + T, which would take longer than 17, and the difference is 4 hours. So the total time for both ways by train would be 17 +4 = 21 hours?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"loses 4 hours\" is compared to some other scenario. Wait, perhaps the problem is structured so that when he takes both ways by train, the total time is 4 hours more than when he takes both ways by car. But the question is asking for the time when he takes both ways by car, so maybe that's the case. Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal scenario: one way by train, return by car: total 17.\n\nScenario 2: both ways by train: he loses 4 hours. So compared to the original scenario? Or compared to another scenario?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the \"loses 4 hours\" is the difference between the two scenarios. Let me see. Let me try to structure equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet T be the time taken by train one way.\n\nLet C be the time taken by car one way.\n\nSo the first scenario: T + C =17.\n\nSecond scenario: both ways by train: 2*T. The problem says he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. So, compared to what? Probably compared to the first scenario. Wait, but if he takes both ways by train, then compared to the original trip (train and car), the total time would be 2T versus T + C. The difference between 2T and (T + C) is T - C. So if he loses 4 hours, that would mean that 2T is 4 hours longer than T + C. Because going both ways by train takes longer, so he \"loses\" time. So the difference is 2T - (T + C) = T - C =4. So T - C =4. \n\nWait, so the problem says he loses 4 hours when he takes both ways by train. So the time taken for both ways by train is 4 hours more than the original trip (which was 17 hours). So 2T = 17 +4 \u2192 2T =21 \u2192 T=10.5 hours. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If going both ways by train takes 4 hours longer than the original 17, then 2T =17 +4 \u2192 21. So T would be 10.5. Then, since T + C =17, then C =17 - T \u2192 17 -10.5 =6.5. Then, going both ways by car would be 2*C =13 hours. But 13 is option E. Hmm, but let's see if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"loses 4 hours\" is compared to going both ways by car. Wait, but the problem says \"if he goes both ways by train\". So perhaps the 4 hours is the difference between the two scenarios (both train vs both car). Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when he takes both ways by train, the total time is 4 hours more than the time when he takes both ways by car. But that's not what the problem says. The problem states \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" So, perhaps the total time for both ways by train is 4 hours more than the time when he went one way by train and one by car. Because that's the original scenario. So the first scenario is 17 hours (train + car). The second scenario (both train) takes 4 hours longer, so 17 +4=21. Then 2T=21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then C =17 - T = 6.5. So both ways by car would be 13, which is option E. But that's one of the options. But let me see if another interpretation is possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"loses 4 hours\" means that when he takes both ways by train, he takes 4 hours longer than if he had taken both ways by car. So 2T = (2C) +4. But then we need another equation. The first equation is T + C =17. Let's see if that works.\n\nSuppose the problem is that going both ways by train takes 4 hours more than both ways by car. So 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2. \n\nThen, from the first equation, T + C =17. Substitute T = C +2 \u2192 (C +2) + C =17 \u2192 2C +2 =17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5, so T=9.5. Then, both ways by car would be 2*7.5 =15, which is not an option. Hmm, so that's not matching the options. So maybe that's not the correct interpretation.\n\nHmm, so going back to first interpretation. Let me rephrase the problem again.\n\nThe first trip: train one way, car the other. Total 17 hours.\n\nThe second scenario: both ways by train. This scenario takes 4 hours longer than the first scenario (since he \"loses\" 4 hours). So 2T = 17 +4 \u2192 21 \u2192 T=10.5, so C=6.5. Thus, both ways by car would be 13 hours. But 13 is option E. But the options include 20, 18, etc. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait the problem says \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" Maybe the \"loses\" is compared to going both ways by car? Then, perhaps when he goes both ways by train, the time is 4 hours more than going both ways by car. So 2T = (2C) +4. But then we also have T + C =17. Let's try solving these equations again.\n\nLet me write equations again:\n\nEquation 1: T + C =17.\n\nEquation 2: 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2.\n\nSubstitute equation 2 into equation 1: (C +2) + C =17 \u2192 2C +2 =17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. Then T=9.5. \n\nThen, both ways by car would be 2C =15, which is not an option. Hmm. So that's a problem. So maybe that's not the right interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"loses 4 hours\" when going both ways by train compared to the original trip (train and car). So the time for both ways by train is 17 +4 =21. So 2T=21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then C=17-10.5=6.5. So both ways by car is 13 (E). But the options have 13 as E. However, let's check the problem again. The question is asking for the time if he went both ways by car, so 2C. So that would be 6.5*2=13. So E is the answer. But why is 20 an option? Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways?\n\nAh, maybe the \"loses 4 hours\" is compared to going both ways by car. So when he takes both ways by train, the time is 4 hours more than if he took both ways by car. So 2T = 2C +4. Then, the first equation is T + C =17. \n\nLet me try solving again with these two equations.\n\nEquation1: T + C =17.\n\nEquation2: 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2.\n\nSubstituting equation2 into equation1:\n\nC+2 + C =17 \u2192 2C +2=17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. Then T is 9.5.\n\nSo both ways by car would be 2*7.5=15. But 15 isn't an option. Hmm. So that's a problem. Since the options don't have 15. So that can't be the correct interpretation.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the first interpretation is correct. Let me go back. So if the two-way train trip takes 4 hours longer than the one-way train and one-way car trip. Then, 2T = (T + C) +4. Since T + C is 17, so 2T =17+4 \u2192 2T=21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then, C is 6.5. So two-way car is 13, which is E. But the options have E as 13, so that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"loses 4 hours\" means that the total time for both ways by train is 4 hours less than the original 17? But that would make 2T =13 \u2192 T=6.5, then C=10.5. Then both ways by car would be 21, which is 21 not listed except maybe 20? Hmm, no. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when he goes both ways by train, he takes 4 hours less than going both ways by car. Then, 2T = 2C -4. But then, with T + C =17. \n\nEquation1: T + C =17\n\nEquation2: 2T = 2C -4 \u2192 T = C -2\n\nSubstituting into equation1: (C-2)+C =17 \u2192 2C -2 =17 \u2192 2C=19 \u2192 C=9.5. Then T=7.5. So both ways by car would be 19, which is not an option. Hmm.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me see the options again. The options are A)22, B)18, C)16, D)20, E)13.\n\nSo if the first interpretation gives E (13), which is an option, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let me set variables again:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet T = time by train one way.\n\nLet C = time by car one way.\n\nFirst scenario: T (train) + C (car) = 17 hours.\n\nSecond scenario: both ways by train \u2192 2T. The problem states that he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. So, the time taken in the second scenario is 4 hours more than the first scenario. Because \"loses\" implies that it takes longer. So 2T = 17 +4 \u2192 21. So T =10.5. Then, C =17 -10.5 =6.5. So both ways by car would be 2*6.5 =13 \u2192 E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says he loses 4 hours compared to another scenario, like going both ways by car. Wait, but the question is asking for the time if he went both ways by car. So perhaps the \"loses 4 hours\" is when he takes both ways by train compared to both ways by car. So 2T = (2C) +4. But then:\n\nWe have T + C =17,\n\nand 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2.\n\nSubstitute into first equation:\n\n(C +2) + C =17 \u2192 2C +2 =17 \u2192 2C =15 \u2192 C=7.5 \u2192 T=9.5.\n\nThen, both ways by car would be 15, which isn't an option. So this can't be correct. Since 15 isn't there, perhaps the first interpretation is correct, giving E as 13. But why is 20 an option? Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me re-express:\n\nIf the first scenario (train one way, car the other) is 17. The second scenario (both by train) takes 4 hours longer than the first. So 2T =17+4 \u2192 21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then, C=17-10.5=6.5. So two ways by car is 13. So answer E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem states that when he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to going both ways by car. So, 2T = 2C -4. Then, with T + C =17. Let's try that.\n\nEquation1: T + C =17.\n\nEquation2: 2T =2C -4 \u2192 T = C -2.\n\nSubstituting equation2 into equation1:\n\n(C-2) + C =17 \u2192 2C -2 =17 \u2192 2C=19 \u2192 C=9.5 \u2192 T=7.5.\n\nThen, two ways by car is 2*9.5 =19. Not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"loses 4 hours\" is the difference between the two one-way trips. Wait, maybe the problem is that when he takes the train both ways, the total time is 4 hours more than if he had taken the car both ways. So 2T = 2C +4. So T = C +2. \n\nThen, the first equation is T + C =17 \u2192 (C +2) + C =17 \u2192 2C +2 =17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. So two ways by car would be 15, not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that going both ways by train takes 4 hours less than going both ways by car. So 2T = 2C -4 \u2192 T = C -2. Then T + C =17 \u2192 (C-2) + C =17 \u2192 2C=19 \u2192 C=9.5, so 2C is 19. Not an option. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. The only interpretation that gives an answer in the options is the first one where the two-way train takes 4 hours longer than the mixed trip. That gives E)13. But let me check the problem again. The wording says \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" The phrase \"loses 4 hours\" might mean that the time taken is 4 hours more. So that's probably correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"loses 4 hours\" compared to going by car both ways. Wait, but if going both ways by train is slower, then going by car would be faster. So if he chooses to go by train both ways, he takes 4 hours more than if he had taken the car both ways. So 2T = 2C +4. But then solving gives 15, which is not there. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" Maybe \"loses\" in the sense of total time, so the total time is increased by 4 hours. So compared to the original trip (train and car), which took 17, the two-way train trip takes 17 +4=21. So that's the first scenario. Which gives 2T=21 \u2192 T=10.5, C=6.5. So two ways by car is 13. So answer E is there. That seems plausible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the total time for both ways by train is 4 hours less than the original trip? That would make 2T =17-4=13 \u2192 T=6.5. Then C=17-6.5=10.5. Then two ways by car would be 2*10.5=21, which isn't an option. So that's not right.\n\nHmm, so the only possible answer that fits is 13 (E). But I need to check the options again. The options are A)22, B)18, C)16, D)20, E)13. So E is there. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let the time by car one way be C, and by train be T.\n\nFirst scenario: T + C =17.\n\nSecond scenario: both by train: 2T. The time taken here is 4 hours more than the first scenario (since he \"loses\" 4 hours). So 2T =17 +4 \u21922T=21 \u2192 T=10.5.\n\nThen, C=17-T =6.5. So both by car would be 2*6.5=13. So answer E.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be E)13. But why is there an option D)20? Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the total time for both ways by train is 4 hours more than going one way by car and one by train. Which is the same as the first scenario, so that's the same as before. So yes, that gives 13.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the equations wrong. Let me try to see another way.\n\nSuppose the time taken for both ways by train is 4 hours more than going both ways by car. So 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2.\n\nThen the first equation is T + C =17. Substitute T = C+2 \u2192 C+2 +C =17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5, T=9.5. So both ways by car is 15. Not an option. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm, so the only possible correct answer is E. The problem must be interpreted as the two-way train trip taking 4 hours longer than the mixed trip. So the answer is E.\n",

So that can't be the correct interpretation.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the first interpretation is correct. Let me go back. So if the two-way train trip takes 4 hours longer than the one-way train and one-way car trip. Then, 2T = (T + C) +4. Since T + C is 17, so 2T =17+4 \u2192 2T=21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then, C is 6.5. So two-way car is 13, which is E. But the options have E as 13, so that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"loses 4 hours\" means that the total time for both ways by train is 4 hours less than the original 17? But that would make 2T =13 \u2192 T=6.5, then C=10.5. Then both ways by car would be 21, which is 21 not listed except maybe 20? Hmm, no. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that when he goes both ways by train, he takes 4 hours less than going both ways by car. Then, 2T = 2C -4. But then, with T + C =17. \n\nEquation1: T + C =17\n\nEquation2: 2T = 2C -4 \u2192 T = C -2\n\nSubstituting into equation1: (C-2)+C =17 \u2192 2C -2 =17 \u2192 2C=19 \u2192 C=9.5. Then T=7.5. So both ways by car would be 19, which is not an option. Hmm.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me see the options again. The options are A)22, B)18, C)16, D)20, E)13.\n\nSo if the first interpretation gives E (13), which is an option, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step.\n\nWait, let's think differently. Let me set variables again:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet T = time by train one way.\n\nLet C = time by car one way.\n\nFirst scenario: T (train) + C (car) = 17 hours.\n\nSecond scenario: both ways by train \u2192 2T. The problem states that he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. So, the time taken in the second scenario is 4 hours more than the first scenario. Because \"loses\" implies that it takes longer. So 2T = 17 +4 \u2192 21. So T =10.5. Then, C =17 -10.5 =6.5. So both ways by car would be 2*6.5 =13 \u2192 E.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says he loses 4 hours compared to another scenario, like going both ways by car. Wait, but the question is asking for the time if he went both ways by car. So perhaps the \"loses 4 hours\" is when he takes both ways by train compared to both ways by car. So 2T = (2C) +4. But then:\n\nWe have T + C =17,\n\nand 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2.\n\nSubstitute into first equation:\n\n(C +2) + C =17 \u2192 2C +2 =17 \u2192 2C =15 \u2192 C=7.5 \u2192 T=9.5.\n\nThen, both ways by car would be 15, which isn't an option. So this can't be correct. Since 15 isn't there, perhaps the first interpretation is correct, giving E as 13. But why is 20 an option? Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me re-express:\n\nIf the first scenario (train one way, car the other) is 17. The second scenario (both by train) takes 4 hours longer than the first. So 2T =17+4 \u2192 21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then, C=17-10.5=6.5. So two ways by car is 13. So answer E.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem states that when he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to going both ways by car. So, 2T = 2C -4. Then, with T + C =17. Let's try that.\n\nEquation1: T + C =17.\n\nEquation2: 2T =2C -4 \u2192 T = C -2.\n\nSubstituting equation2 into equation1:\n\n(C-2) + C =17 \u2192 2C -2 =17 \u2192 2C=19 \u2192 C=9.5 \u2192 T=7.5.\n\nThen, two ways by car is 2*9.5 =19. Not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"loses 4 hours\" is the difference between the two one-way trips. Wait, maybe the problem is that when he takes the train both ways, the total time is 4 hours more than if he had taken the car both ways. So 2T = 2C +4. So T = C +2. \n\nThen, the first equation is T + C =17 \u2192 (C +2) + C =17 \u2192 2C +2 =17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. So two ways by car would be 15, not an option. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that going both ways by train takes 4 hours less than going both ways by car. So 2T = 2C -4 \u2192 T = C -2. Then T + C =17 \u2192 (C-2) + C =17 \u2192 2C=19 \u2192 C=9.5, so 2C is 19. Not an option. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. The only interpretation that gives an answer in the options is the first one where the two-way train takes 4 hours longer than the mixed trip. That gives E)13. But let me check the problem again. The wording says \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" The phrase \"loses 4 hours\" might mean that the time taken is 4 hours more. So that's probably correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"loses 4 hours\" compared to going by car both ways. Wait, but if going both ways by train is slower, then going by car would be faster. So if he chooses to go by train both ways, he takes 4 hours more than if he had taken the car both ways. So 2T = 2C +4. But then solving gives 15, which is not there. Hmm.\n\nWait, the problem says \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" Maybe \"loses\" in the sense of total time, so the total time is increased by 4 hours. So compared to the original trip (train and car), which took 17, the two-way train trip takes 17 +4=21. So that's the first scenario. Which gives 2T=21 \u2192 T=10.5, C=6.5. So two ways by car is 13. So answer E is there. That seems plausible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the total time for both ways by train is 4 hours less than the original trip? That would make 2T =17-4=13 \u2192 T=6.5. Then C=17-6.5=10.5. Then two ways by car would be 2*10.5=21, which isn't an option. So that's not right.\n\nHmm, so the only possible answer that fits is 13 (E). But I need to check the options again. The options are A)22, B)18, C)16, D)20, E)13. So E is there. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step. Let me think again.\n\nWait, another approach. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let the time by car one way be C, and by train be T.\n\nFirst scenario: T + C =17.\n\nSecond scenario: both by train: 2T. The time taken here is 4 hours more than the first scenario (since he \"loses\" 4 hours). So 2T =17 +4 \u21922T=21 \u2192 T=10.5.\n\nThen, C=17-T =6.5. So both by car would be 2*6.5=13. So answer E.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So the answer should be E)13. But why is there an option D)20? Maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the total time for both ways by train is 4 hours more than going one way by car and one by train. Which is the same as the first scenario, so that's the same as before. So yes, that gives 13.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the equations wrong. Let me try to see another way.\n\nSuppose the time taken for both ways by train is 4 hours more than going both ways by car. So 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2.\n\nThen the first equation is T + C =17. Substitute T = C+2 \u2192 C+2 +C =17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5, T=9.5. So both ways by car is 15. Not an option. So that's not possible.\n\nHmm, so the only possible correct answer is E. The problem must be interpreted as the two-way train trip taking 4 hours longer than the mixed trip. So the answer is E.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote the time taken by train one way as \\( T \\) and by car one way as \\( C \\).\n\n**Given:**\n1. \\( T + C = 17 \\) hours (train one way and car return).\n2. When traveling both ways by train, the total time increases by 4 hours compared to the mixed trip. Thus, \\( 2T = 17 + 4 \\).\n\n**Calculations:**\n- From the second condition:  \n  \\( 2T = 21 \\Rightarrow T = 10.5 \\) hours.\n- Substitute \\( T = 10.5 \\) into the first equation:  \n  \\( 10.5 + C = 17 \\Rightarrow C = 6.5 \\) hours.\n\n**Time for both ways by car:**  \n\\( 2C = 2 \\times 6.5 = 13 \\) hours.\n\n**Answer:** E)13.\n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Mr. Sam traveling to a city and returning. The question is asking how long he would take if he went both ways by car. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let me parse the information given. The first part says he takes 17 hours to go by train and return by car. So that's one way by train and the return by car, total 17 hours. Then, if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. Wait, what does \"loses 4 hours\" mean here? Oh, probably that going both ways by train takes 4 hours longer than the original trip (which was one train and one car). Or maybe compared to going both ways by car? Wait, the wording might need more attention.\n\nLet me re-read the problem. The first scenario: he goes by train and returns by car, total time 17 hours. The second scenario: if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. Hmm, so maybe when he takes the train both ways, the total time is 4 hours more than the original 17? Or is it compared to going both ways by car? Wait, that's unclear. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured this way: The first case is train one way and car the other, taking 17 hours. The second case says that if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to the first scenario? Or perhaps compared to going both ways by car? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous here. Let me think of possible interpretations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train\" compared to the original one-way train and one-way car trip. So the total time for both ways by train would be 17 + 4 = 21 hours? Because going both ways by train adds 4 hours to the original 17? Or is it the other way around?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"loses 4 hours\" is in comparison to another scenario. Maybe if he went both ways by car, that's the reference. Wait, perhaps I need to set up variables here.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let the time taken by train one way be T, and by car one way be C. Then the first scenario is T + C = 17 hours. \n\nNow, the second part says he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. So going both ways by train would take 2*T. But compared to what? The problem says \"if he goes both ways by train. He loses 4 hours...\" Maybe compared to the original trip (train one way and car the other). Wait, but the original trip is one way each. So going both ways by train would be longer than the original trip?\n\nWait, the original trip was a round trip (go and return) taking 17 hours. If he instead takes the train both ways, that round trip would take 2*T. The problem states that in this case, he loses 4 hours. So perhaps the time taken for both ways by train is 4 hours more than the original 17? Because \"loses\" implies that it takes longer. So 2*T = 17 +4 =21. So then 2*T =21, so T=10.5 hours. \n\nThen, since T + C =17, substituting T gives 10.5 + C =17 \u2192 C =6.5 hours. \n\nThen, the question is asking for the time taken if he went both ways by car, which would be 2*C = 2*6.5 =13 hours. But looking at the options, E is 13. But wait, that seems possible. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the interpretation is correct. The problem says \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" The wording might mean that going both ways by train adds 4 hours compared to some other scenario. The original scenario (train and car) is 17. So if he takes the train both ways, it's 2*T. The problem says he loses 4 hours, so perhaps that 2*T = (T + C) +4 \u2192 because going both ways by train takes 4 hours longer than the original trip. So that would be 2T =17 +4 \u2192 2T=21, which gives T=10.5, as above. Then the car one way would be 17 -10.5 =6.5. So two ways would be 13, which is option E. But wait, the options include E as 13. However, let me see the options again. The options given are A)22, B)18, C)16, D)20, E)13. So that would be E. But maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"loses 4 hours\" is in comparison to going both ways by car. Let me think again. Suppose the problem is structured this way: The original trip (train one way and car return) is 17 hours. If he takes the train both ways, he loses 4 hours compared to taking the car both ways. Hmm, that's another possible interpretation. But the wording isn't very clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem states that when he takes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to the original scenario. Let me re-read the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways?\"\n\nHmm, the wording is \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" The phrasing \"loses 4 hours\" might mean that the total time increases by 4 hours compared to the original scenario (the 17 hours). So original time is 17 (train + car). If he takes both ways by train, the time is 2*T. The difference between 2*T and (T + C) is 4 hours. Since 2*T - (T + C) = T - C = 4. So T - C =4. \n\nBut also, from the first equation, T + C =17. So we can set up the two equations:\n\n1) T + C =17\n\n2) T - C =4\n\nAdding these equations: 2T =21 \u2192 T=10.5, then C =17-10.5=6.5. So two ways by car would be 2*6.5=13, which is E. So that would make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"loses\" is the other way around? Like, if he takes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to another scenario. Wait, but the problem says \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" The phrasing could also mean that the total time is 4 hours less? But that would not make sense because taking the train both ways would probably take longer if the car is faster. Wait, maybe the car is faster than the train? Because in the first scenario, going by train and returning by car takes 17 hours. If the car is faster, then going by car both ways would take less time than the original 17? But in that case, if taking the train both ways takes longer than the original 17, then the \"loses\" makes sense as taking more time. \n\nSo according to the equations above, the answer would be 13, which is E. But looking at the options, the options include 13 as E. But wait, another way to think: perhaps \"loses 4 hours\" is compared to going by car both ways. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the problem is that going both ways by train takes 4 hours longer than going both ways by car. Then, 2*T = (2*C) +4. But then we have two equations:\n\nFirst: T + C =17\n\nSecond: 2*T = 2*C +4 \u2192 T = C +2.\n\nThen substituting into first equation: (C+2) + C =17 \u2192 2C +2=17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. Then 2*C would be 15, which is not among the options. Hmm, that's a problem. So that interpretation might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to the original trip (train and car). So the time for both ways by train is 17 +4=21, so 2T=21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then, as before, C=6.5. So the car both ways is 13. So that would be E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"loses\" is in the sense that the total time would be 4 hours less, but that would not make sense because taking the slower train both ways would take longer. So the first interpretation is probably correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options include 13, but sometimes the answer might be different. Let me see another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet the time by train one way be T, by car be C. \n\nScenario 1: Train one way + car return: T + C =17.\n\nScenario 2: Both ways by train: 2T. The problem states that he \"loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" The \"loses\" might mean that this scenario takes 4 hours longer than the first scenario. So 2T = (T + C) +4 \u2192 2T =17 +4 \u2192 T=21/2=10.5. Then C is 17-10.5=6.5. Then car both ways is 2*6.5=13 (E). So that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"loses 4 hours\" compared to going both ways by car. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the time for both ways by train is 4 hours more than both ways by car. Then 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2. \n\nThen, from scenario 1: T + C =17. Substitute T: (C+2) + C =17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. Then both ways by car is 15, which is not an option. Since the options don't have 15, that can't be right. So that's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the first interpretation must be correct, leading to E)13. But wait, the options given include E as 13, but the problem might have a different answer. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" So perhaps the total time when taking both ways by train is 4 hours more than the original 17. So 2T =17+4 \u2192 21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then car one way is 6.5. So both ways by car is 13. So that's E. \n\nHmm, but let me check again. The options include 20, which is D. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"loses 4 hours\" is in comparison to going both ways by car. So if he goes both ways by train, he takes 4 hours longer than going both ways by car. So 2T = 2C +4. \n\nThen, we have two equations:\n\n1) T + C =17\n\n2) 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1: (C+2) + C =17 \u2192 2C+2=17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. \n\nThen, both ways by car would be 2C =15, which isn't an option. So that's not possible. So this can't be the correct interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when he takes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to going one way by train and one by car. That would be the same as the first scenario. So 2T = (T + C) +4 \u2192 2T =17+4 \u2192 T=10.5, leading to the same answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that if he takes both ways by train, the total time is 4 hours less than some other scenario. That would not make sense. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is E)13. But wait, the options given include E)13. But maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me see the problem again. \n\nWait, maybe the problem says he \"loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train\". So maybe when he takes both ways by train, the total time is 4 hours more than if he went both ways by car. Wait, but that would require the equation 2T = 2C +4, but as before, that leads to 15, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"loses 4 hours\" means that the total time is 4 hours less. But that would be if the train is faster than the car, which contradicts the first scenario. Because in the first scenario, going by train one way and car the other took 17 hours. If the train were faster, then taking the train both ways would be better. But the problem says he \"loses\" time, so probably the train is slower. \n\nWait, maybe I have the variables reversed. Let me try again, maybe I assigned T and C wrong. \n\nSuppose the time by car is faster. Let me define:\n\nLet\u2019s let T be time by train one way, C time by car one way. \n\nSo, going by train and returning by car: T + C =17. \n\nIf he goes both ways by train, that would take 2T. The problem says he loses 4 hours, so that scenario takes 4 hours more than the original trip. So 2T =17 +4 \u2192 2T=21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then C=17-10.5=6.5. So both ways by car would be 2*6.5=13. So that's E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the \"loses 4 hours\" is in comparison to going both ways by car. Let me think again. Let\u2019s say that going both ways by train takes 4 hours longer than going both ways by car. Then 2T = 2C +4. \n\nBut then with T + C =17, solving:\n\nFrom 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2. \n\nSubstitute into T + C =17 \u2192 (C+2) +C =17 \u2192 2C =15 \u2192 C=7.5. \n\nThen, both ways by car would be 15, which is not an option. So that's not possible. \n\nHence, the first approach must be correct, leading to E)13. \n\nWait but the options have E as 13, so that's probably the correct answer. But I need to make sure. Let me check again the problem's wording again. \n\nThe problem says: \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" \n\nThe key is to figure out what the comparison is. The original trip (train one way and car the other) took 17 hours. If he takes both ways by train, he's adding an extra 4 hours compared to that original trip. So that gives 17+4=21 hours for both ways by train. Then, solving for T and C, then getting the car time both ways as 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"loses 4 hours\" means that the total time is 4 hours less? But that would be if the train is faster. Let's see: \n\nSuppose going both ways by train takes 4 hours less than the original trip. Then 2T =17-4=13 \u2192 T=6.5. Then C=17-T=10.5. Then both ways by car would be 2*10.5=21, which is option A. But that's not matching. \n\nBut in that case, the car would be slower (since going by car takes 10.5, which is longer than the train's 6.5). But then the original trip was train one way (6.5) and car the other (10.5), totaling 17. If he takes both ways by train, it's 13, which is indeed 4 less than 17. But the problem says he \"loses\" 4 hours. That might not make sense because going both ways by train would be faster, so he would save time, not lose. So \"loses\" probably implies that it takes longer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be E)13. \n\nWait, but the options given include E as 13. So I think that's the correct answer. But let me check again. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the problem states that going both ways by train causes him to lose 4 hours compared to going both ways by car. Then, the time for both ways by train is 4 hours more than both ways by car. \n\nSo, 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2. \n\nThen from the first equation, T + C =17 \u2192 substituting T gives C+2 + C =17 \u2192 2C +2 =17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. \n\nThen, both ways by car would be 2*7.5=15, which is not an option. So that can't be. \n\nTherefore, the only possible correct interpretation is that the \"lose 4 hours\" is compared to the original scenario (train and car), so the answer is E. \n\nHmm, but wait the options given include E as 13, so I think that's the correct answer. However, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me see again. \n\nWait, let me try plugging in the options to see. Let's suppose the answer is E)13. So both ways by car take 13 hours, so one way by car is 6.5. Then the original trip (train + car) is T +6.5 =17 \u2192 T=10.5. Then both ways by train would be 2*10.5=21. The difference between 21 and 17 is 4 hours, so that matches the problem's statement. So that works. \n\nAnother option, like D)20. Let's see if that could be possible. Suppose both ways by car take 20 \u2192 each way is 10. Then original trip T +10 =17 \u2192 T=7. \n\nThen both ways by train would be 14, which is 3 hours less than 17. So he would have gained time, not lost. So that doesn't fit. \n\nOption C)16: car both ways 16 \u2192 one way 8. Then T=17-8=9. Both ways by train: 18, which is 1 hour more than 17. So difference of 1, not 4. So no. \n\nOption B)18: car both ways 18 \u2192 one way 9. Original trip T +9 =17 \u2192 T=8. Both ways by train: 16, which is 1 hour less than 17. Not 4. \n\nOption A)22: car both ways 22 \u2192 one way 11. Then T=17-11=6. Both ways by train would be 12, which is 5 hours less. Not matching. \n\nSo only E fits. Therefore, the correct answer is E)13. \n\nWait but I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems can trick you. Let me confirm once more. \n\nOriginal trip: T + C =17.\n\nBoth ways by train: 2T = 17 +4 \u2192 21 \u2192 T=10.5, C=6.5. \n\nBoth ways by car: 2C =13. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer must be E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Mr. Sam traveling to a city and returning. The question is asking how long he would take if he went both ways by car. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let me parse the information given. The first part says he takes 17 hours to go by train and return by car. So that's one way by train and the return by car, total 17 hours. Then, if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. Wait, what does \"loses 4 hours\" mean here? Oh, probably that going both ways by train takes 4 hours longer than the original trip (which was one train and one car). Or maybe compared to going both ways by car? Wait, the wording might need more attention.\n\nLet me re-read the problem. The first scenario: he goes by train and returns by car, total time 17 hours. The second scenario: if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours. Hmm, so maybe when he takes the train both ways, the total time is 4 hours more than the original 17? Or is it compared to going both ways by car? Wait, that's unclear. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured this way: The first case is train one way and car the other, taking 17 hours. The second case says that if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to the first scenario? Or perhaps compared to going both ways by car? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous here. Let me think of possible interpretations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train\" compared to the original one-way train and one-way car trip. So the total time for both ways by train would be 17 + 4 = 21 hours? Because going both ways by train adds 4 hours to the original 17? Or is it the other way around?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"loses 4 hours\" is in comparison to another scenario. Maybe if he went both ways by car, that's the reference. Wait, perhaps I need to set up variables here.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let the time taken by train one way be T, and by car one way be C. Then the first scenario is T + C = 17 hours. \n\nNow, the second part says he loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. So going both ways by train would take 2*T. But compared to what? The problem says \"if he goes both ways by train. He loses 4 hours...\" Maybe compared to the original trip (train one way and car the other). Wait, but the original trip is one way each. So going both ways by train would be longer than the original trip?\n\nWait, the original trip was a round trip (go and return) taking 17 hours. If he instead takes the train both ways, that round trip would take 2*T. The problem states that in this case, he loses 4 hours. So perhaps the time taken for both ways by train is 4 hours more than the original 17? Because \"loses\" implies that it takes longer. So 2*T = 17 +4 =21. So then 2*T =21, so T=10.5 hours. \n\nThen, since T + C =17, substituting T gives 10.5 + C =17 \u2192 C =6.5 hours. \n\nThen, the question is asking for the time taken if he went both ways by car, which would be 2*C = 2*6.5 =13 hours. But looking at the options, E is 13. But wait, that seems possible. But let me check if that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me make sure that the interpretation is correct. The problem says \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" The wording might mean that going both ways by train adds 4 hours compared to some other scenario. The original scenario (train and car) is 17. So if he takes the train both ways, it's 2*T. The problem says he loses 4 hours, so perhaps that 2*T = (T + C) +4 \u2192 because going both ways by train takes 4 hours longer than the original trip. So that would be 2T =17 +4 \u2192 2T=21, which gives T=10.5, as above. Then the car one way would be 17 -10.5 =6.5. So two ways would be 13, which is option E. But wait, the options include E as 13. However, let me see the options again. The options given are A)22, B)18, C)16, D)20, E)13. So that would be E. But maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"loses 4 hours\" is in comparison to going both ways by car. Let me think again. Suppose the problem is structured this way: The original trip (train one way and car return) is 17 hours. If he takes the train both ways, he loses 4 hours compared to taking the car both ways. Hmm, that's another possible interpretation. But the wording isn't very clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem states that when he takes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to the original scenario. Let me re-read the problem again.\n\nOriginal problem: \"Mr.Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car. He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train. How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways?\"\n\nHmm, the wording is \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" The phrasing \"loses 4 hours\" might mean that the total time increases by 4 hours compared to the original scenario (the 17 hours). So original time is 17 (train + car). If he takes both ways by train, the time is 2*T. The difference between 2*T and (T + C) is 4 hours. Since 2*T - (T + C) = T - C = 4. So T - C =4. \n\nBut also, from the first equation, T + C =17. So we can set up the two equations:\n\n1) T + C =17\n\n2) T - C =4\n\nAdding these equations: 2T =21 \u2192 T=10.5, then C =17-10.5=6.5. So two ways by car would be 2*6.5=13, which is E. So that would make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"loses\" is the other way around? Like, if he takes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to another scenario. Wait, but the problem says \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" The phrasing could also mean that the total time is 4 hours less? But that would not make sense because taking the train both ways would probably take longer if the car is faster. Wait, maybe the car is faster than the train? Because in the first scenario, going by train and returning by car takes 17 hours. If the car is faster, then going by car both ways would take less time than the original 17? But in that case, if taking the train both ways takes longer than the original 17, then the \"loses\" makes sense as taking more time. \n\nSo according to the equations above, the answer would be 13, which is E. But looking at the options, the options include 13 as E. But wait, another way to think: perhaps \"loses 4 hours\" is compared to going by car both ways. Let me see.\n\nSuppose the problem is that going both ways by train takes 4 hours longer than going both ways by car. Then, 2*T = (2*C) +4. But then we have two equations:\n\nFirst: T + C =17\n\nSecond: 2*T = 2*C +4 \u2192 T = C +2.\n\nThen substituting into first equation: (C+2) + C =17 \u2192 2C +2=17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. Then 2*C would be 15, which is not among the options. Hmm, that's a problem. So that interpretation might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says that if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to the original trip (train and car). So the time for both ways by train is 17 +4=21, so 2T=21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then, as before, C=6.5. So the car both ways is 13. So that would be E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the \"loses\" is in the sense that the total time would be 4 hours less, but that would not make sense because taking the slower train both ways would take longer. So the first interpretation is probably correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options include 13, but sometimes the answer might be different. Let me see another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet the time by train one way be T, by car be C. \n\nScenario 1: Train one way + car return: T + C =17.\n\nScenario 2: Both ways by train: 2T. The problem states that he \"loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" The \"loses\" might mean that this scenario takes 4 hours longer than the first scenario. So 2T = (T + C) +4 \u2192 2T =17 +4 \u2192 T=21/2=10.5. Then C is 17-10.5=6.5. Then car both ways is 2*6.5=13 (E). So that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"loses 4 hours\" compared to going both ways by car. Let's see:\n\nSuppose the time for both ways by train is 4 hours more than both ways by car. Then 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2. \n\nThen, from scenario 1: T + C =17. Substitute T: (C+2) + C =17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. Then both ways by car is 15, which is not an option. Since the options don't have 15, that can't be right. So that's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the first interpretation must be correct, leading to E)13. But wait, the options given include E as 13, but the problem might have a different answer. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" So perhaps the total time when taking both ways by train is 4 hours more than the original 17. So 2T =17+4 \u2192 21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then car one way is 6.5. So both ways by car is 13. So that's E. \n\nHmm, but let me check again. The options include 20, which is D. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"loses 4 hours\" is in comparison to going both ways by car. So if he goes both ways by train, he takes 4 hours longer than going both ways by car. So 2T = 2C +4. \n\nThen, we have two equations:\n\n1) T + C =17\n\n2) 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2.\n\nSubstitute into equation 1: (C+2) + C =17 \u2192 2C+2=17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. \n\nThen, both ways by car would be 2C =15, which isn't an option. So that's not possible. So this can't be the correct interpretation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that when he takes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours compared to going one way by train and one by car. That would be the same as the first scenario. So 2T = (T + C) +4 \u2192 2T =17+4 \u2192 T=10.5, leading to the same answer. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that if he takes both ways by train, the total time is 4 hours less than some other scenario. That would not make sense. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is E)13. But wait, the options given include E)13. But maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me see the problem again. \n\nWait, maybe the problem says he \"loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train\". So maybe when he takes both ways by train, the total time is 4 hours more than if he went both ways by car. Wait, but that would require the equation 2T = 2C +4, but as before, that leads to 15, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"loses 4 hours\" means that the total time is 4 hours less. But that would be if the train is faster than the car, which contradicts the first scenario. Because in the first scenario, going by train one way and car the other took 17 hours. If the train were faster, then taking the train both ways would be better. But the problem says he \"loses\" time, so probably the train is slower. \n\nWait, maybe I have the variables reversed. Let me try again, maybe I assigned T and C wrong. \n\nSuppose the time by car is faster. Let me define:\n\nLet\u2019s let T be time by train one way, C time by car one way. \n\nSo, going by train and returning by car: T + C =17. \n\nIf he goes both ways by train, that would take 2T. The problem says he loses 4 hours, so that scenario takes 4 hours more than the original trip. So 2T =17 +4 \u2192 2T=21 \u2192 T=10.5. Then C=17-10.5=6.5. So both ways by car would be 2*6.5=13. So that's E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the \"loses 4 hours\" is in comparison to going both ways by car. Let me think again. Let\u2019s say that going both ways by train takes 4 hours longer than going both ways by car. Then 2T = 2C +4. \n\nBut then with T + C =17, solving:\n\nFrom 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2. \n\nSubstitute into T + C =17 \u2192 (C+2) +C =17 \u2192 2C =15 \u2192 C=7.5. \n\nThen, both ways by car would be 15, which is not an option. So that's not possible. \n\nHence, the first approach must be correct, leading to E)13. \n\nWait but the options have E as 13, so that's probably the correct answer. But I need to make sure. Let me check again the problem's wording again. \n\nThe problem says: \"He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.\" \n\nThe key is to figure out what the comparison is. The original trip (train one way and car the other) took 17 hours. If he takes both ways by train, he's adding an extra 4 hours compared to that original trip. So that gives 17+4=21 hours for both ways by train. Then, solving for T and C, then getting the car time both ways as 13. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"loses 4 hours\" means that the total time is 4 hours less? But that would be if the train is faster. Let's see: \n\nSuppose going both ways by train takes 4 hours less than the original trip. Then 2T =17-4=13 \u2192 T=6.5. Then C=17-T=10.5. Then both ways by car would be 2*10.5=21, which is option A. But that's not matching. \n\nBut in that case, the car would be slower (since going by car takes 10.5, which is longer than the train's 6.5). But then the original trip was train one way (6.5) and car the other (10.5), totaling 17. If he takes both ways by train, it's 13, which is indeed 4 less than 17. But the problem says he \"loses\" 4 hours. That might not make sense because going both ways by train would be faster, so he would save time, not lose. So \"loses\" probably implies that it takes longer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be E)13. \n\nWait, but the options given include E as 13. So I think that's the correct answer. But let me check again. \n\nWait another thought: perhaps the problem states that going both ways by train causes him to lose 4 hours compared to going both ways by car. Then, the time for both ways by train is 4 hours more than both ways by car. \n\nSo, 2T = 2C +4 \u2192 T = C +2. \n\nThen from the first equation, T + C =17 \u2192 substituting T gives C+2 + C =17 \u2192 2C +2 =17 \u2192 2C=15 \u2192 C=7.5. \n\nThen, both ways by car would be 2*7.5=15, which is not an option. So that can't be. \n\nTherefore, the only possible correct interpretation is that the \"lose 4 hours\" is compared to the original scenario (train and car), so the answer is E. \n\nHmm, but wait the options given include E as 13, so I think that's the correct answer. However, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me see again. \n\nWait, let me try plugging in the options to see. Let's suppose the answer is E)13. So both ways by car take 13 hours, so one way by car is 6.5. Then the original trip (train + car) is T +6.5 =17 \u2192 T=10.5. Then both ways by train would be 2*10.5=21. The difference between 21 and 17 is 4 hours, so that matches the problem's statement. So that works. \n\nAnother option, like D)20. Let's see if that could be possible. Suppose both ways by car take 20 \u2192 each way is 10. Then original trip T +10 =17 \u2192 T=7. \n\nThen both ways by train would be 14, which is 3 hours less than 17. So he would have gained time, not lost. So that doesn't fit. \n\nOption C)16: car both ways 16 \u2192 one way 8. Then T=17-8=9. Both ways by train: 18, which is 1 hour more than 17. So difference of 1, not 4. So no. \n\nOption B)18: car both ways 18 \u2192 one way 9. Original trip T +9 =17 \u2192 T=8. Both ways by train: 16, which is 1 hour less than 17. Not 4. \n\nOption A)22: car both ways 22 \u2192 one way 11. Then T=17-11=6. Both ways by train would be 12, which is 5 hours less. Not matching. \n\nSo only E fits. Therefore, the correct answer is E)13. \n\nWait but I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems can trick you. Let me confirm once more. \n\nOriginal trip: T + C =17.\n\nBoth ways by train: 2T = 17 +4 \u2192 21 \u2192 T=10.5, C=6.5. \n\nBoth ways by car: 2C =13. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer must be E.\n\n\nLet \\( T \\) be the time taken by train one way and \\( C \\) be the time taken by car one way. The problem states that traveling by train one way and car the other takes 17 hours:  \n\\[ T + C = 17 \\]  \n\nIf Mr. Sam takes the train both ways, he loses 4 hours compared to the original trip. This implies the round trip by train takes \\( 17 + 4 = 21 \\) hours:  \n\\[ 2T = 21 \\implies T = 10.5 \\]  \n\nSubstituting \\( T = 10.5 \\) into the first equation:  \n\\[ 10.5 + C = 17 \\implies C = 6.5 \\]  \n\nThe time for a round trip by car is:  \n\\[ 2C = 2 \\times 6.5 = 13 \\]  \n\nThus, the correct answer is **E**.  \n\nAnswer: E",
