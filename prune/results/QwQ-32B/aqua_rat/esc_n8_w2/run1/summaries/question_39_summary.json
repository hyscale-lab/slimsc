      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the monthly sales needed for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. Her salary is made up of a fixed part and a percentage of sales. The fixed part is $500, and then she gets 5% of all monthly sales. So I need to figure out what the sales amount has to be so that when you add 5% of that to $500, the total is $1500.\n\nHmm, let me set this up as an equation. Let me call the monthly sales \"S\". Wait, the problem says the salary S is the sum, but maybe I should use another variable for sales to avoid confusion. Let me think. The question uses S for salary, so maybe I should use another letter like \"x\" for sales. Yeah, that's better. So the salary equation would be:\n\nSalary = 500 + 0.05 * x\n\nAnd we want the salary to be 1500. So set that equal to 1500:\n\n500 + 0.05x = 1500\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Subtract 500 from both sides first.\n\n0.05x = 1500 - 500  \n0.05x = 1000\n\nThen, divide both sides by 0.05 to get x.\n\nx = 1000 / 0.05  \nHmm, what's 1000 divided by 0.05? Well, 0.05 is the same as 5%, so dividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by 20. Because 1/0.05 = 20. So 1000 * 20 = 20,000. Wait, that would make x = 20,000?\n\nWait, but let me check the math again. Let's do it step by step. 1000 divided by 0.05. Let's see, 0.05 times 20,000 equals 1000. Because 0.05 * 20,000 is 1000. So yes, that's correct. \n\nSo the required monthly sales are $20,000. Looking at the options, D is $20,000. So the answer should be D?\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Let me plug it back into the original equation. If sales are $20,000, then 5% of that is 0.05 * 20,000 = 1000. Adding the fixed $500 gives 1500. Exactly the target. So that's right.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again. The options are A)50k, B)40k, C)30k, D)20k, E) None. So D is 20k, which is what I got. So the answer must be D. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation?\n\nLet me try another way. Suppose the sales were 20,000. 5% of 20,000 is 1,000. 500 + 1,000 = 1,500. Perfect. So that's exactly the salary they want. So D is correct. Then why is option E there? Maybe a trick? Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says \"monthly sales be so that her monthly salary reaches $1500\". So yes, that's exactly what we solved. So D should be the correct answer. Hmm, but maybe I misread the percentage? The problem states 5% of all monthly sales. Yes, so 5% is correct. The fixed is 500. So all steps are correct. \n\nTherefore the correct option is D.\n",
