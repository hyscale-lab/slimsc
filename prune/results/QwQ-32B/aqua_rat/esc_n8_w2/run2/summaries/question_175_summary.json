      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here about cutting a rope into two pieces. The total length is 20 meters. One piece is 3 meters shorter than the other. I need to find the length of the longer piece. Hmm, how do I approach this?\n\nAlright, so let me think. Let's call the length of the longer piece something, maybe x. Then the shorter one would be x minus 3, right? Because it's 3 meters shorter. Wait, but when I add both pieces together, they should total 20 meters. So the equation would be x (the longer) plus (x - 3) equals 20. Let me write that down:\n\nx + (x - 3) = 20\n\nSimplifying that, that's 2x - 3 = 20. Then adding 3 to both sides gives 2x = 23. Dividing by 2 would give x = 11.5. Oh, so that's option D? Let me check again to be sure.\n\nWait another way: Suppose the two pieces are L and S. Then L + S = 20, and S = L - 3. Substituting the second into the first: L + (L -3) = 20. That's the same equation as before. So solving gives 2L -3 =20 \u2192 2L=23 \u2192 L=11.5. Yeah, that's D. Let me check the options again. The options are A)7.5, B)8.9, C)9.9, D)11.5, E)11.7. So D is there. \n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake. Let me try plugging the numbers. If the longer is 11.5, then the shorter is 11.5 -3 = 8.5. Adding them together gives 11.5 +8.5=20. Yep, that works. So the answer must be D. I don't see any other possible way. The other options don't fit. Like if I thought the shorter was x, then the longer would be x +3. Then x + x+3 =20 \u2192 2x+3=20 \u2192 2x=17 \u2192 x=8.5. Then longer is 11.5. Either way, same result. So yeah, D is correct.\n",
