      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Amy has 10 different types of books and she wants to code each with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters. The question is asking for the smallest number of letters needed so that all 10 types can be uniquely represented. And the order in the pair doesn't matter, which probably means combinations, not permutations. \n\nHmm, right. So, the problem is about figuring out the minimum number of letters (let's say n letters) such that the total number of possible codes (single letters plus combinations of two different letters) is at least 10. Since the order doesn't matter for pairs, those would be combinations of 2 from n, so the formula is C(n,2) + n. Because the single letters are just n options, and pairs are combinations of 2.\n\nSo the total codes available would be n + (n*(n-1))/2. We need this total to be \u226510. So I need to find the smallest n where that equation holds.\n\nLet me test the options given. The options are 3,4,5,10,20. Let's start with the smallest ones first.\n\nOption A is 3. Let's plug in n=3:\n\nTotal codes = 3 + (3*2)/2 = 3 +3 =6. That's only 6 codes. But Amy needs 10. So 3 is too small.\n\nNext, option B is 4. Let's see:\n\n4 + (4*3)/2 =4 +6=10. Oh! Exactly 10. Wait, that's perfect. So with 4 letters, she can make 4 single letters and 6 pairs, totaling 10. That's exactly what's needed. So that would be the minimum. So the answer would be B)4?\n\nBut wait, let me check the next option to be sure. Option C is 5. Let's see n=5:\n\n5 + (5*4)/2 =5 +10=15. That's more than enough, but since 4 works, 5 isn't the minimal. So the answer must be B.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The problem says \"either a single letter or a pair of two different letters\". So pairs must be different letters, so combinations without repetition. So the calculation is correct. For n letters, the combinations are indeed C(n,2) pairs plus n singles. \n\nYes, so with n=4, that gives exactly 10. So the answer is B. So the correct choice is B)4.\n",

The question is asking for the smallest number of letters she needs so that all 10 types can be uniquely represented. The order in the pair doesn't matter, so like AB is the same as BA. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me think. This sounds like a combination problem. Because when the order doesn't matter for the pairs, that's combinations, not permutations. So the total number of possible codes would be the number of single letters plus the number of combinations of two different letters.\n\nLet me denote the number of letters Amy uses as n. Then the number of single-letter codes is just n. The number of two-letter codes would be the combination of n letters taken 2 at a time, which is n choose 2, so that's n(n-1)/2. \n\nSo the total codes possible with n letters would be n + n(n-1)/2. We need this total to be at least 10 because she has 10 types. The question is to find the smallest n where this sum is \u226510.\n\nLet me set up the inequality: n + [n(n-1)/2] \u2265 10. Let's simplify that equation. Let's combine the terms. Let me compute the left side:\n\nn + (n(n-1)/2) = (2n + n(n-1)) / 2 = (n\u00b2 -n + 2n)/2 = (n\u00b2 +n)/2. \n\nSo the equation becomes (n\u00b2 +n)/2 \u226510. Multiply both sides by 2: n\u00b2 +n \u226520.\n\nNow, we can solve n\u00b2 +n -20 \u22650. Let's find the roots of the quadratic equation n\u00b2 +n -20=0. Using the quadratic formula: n = [-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 80)] /2 = [-1 \u00b1 sqrt(81)]/2 = [-1 \u00b19]/2.\n\nThe positive root is ( -1 +9)/2 =8/2=4. The other root is negative, so we can ignore it. So the equation equals zero at n=4. Since the quadratic opens upwards (coefficient of n\u00b2 is positive), the inequality n\u00b2 +n -20 \u22650 is satisfied when n \u2264-5 (not possible) or n \u22654. So when n is 4 or more, the total codes are \u226510. \n\nWait, but let me check for n=4. Let's compute the actual number of codes. For n=4:\n\nSingle letters:4. Pairs: 4C2=6. Total is 4+6=10. Exactly 10. So that's perfect. So n=4 would be sufficient. \n\nWait, but let me check n=3 to see if maybe it's possible. Let's see:\n\nn=3: single letters:3. Pairs:3C2=3. Total 6. 6 is less than 10. So that's not enough. So 3 letters gives 6 codes, which is insufficient. 4 letters gives exactly 10. So the minimal n is 4. So the answer should be B)4.\n\nWait the options are A)3, B)4, etc. So yeah, the answer should be B. Let me confirm once more. Let me list them for n=4. Letters A,B,C,D.\n\nSingle letters: A,B,C,D (4). Pairs: AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. That's 6. 4+6=10. Exactly matches the required 10. So 4 is enough. So the minimal number is 4.
