      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the percentage gain for a merchant who bought oranges and sold them. Hmm, I need to find the percentage profit here. Alright, step by step.\n\nFirst, the merchant bought 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450. So the total cost price is 450 rupees. Then he sold the entire lot at 7.50 per kg. So the selling price per kg is 7.50. To find the total selling price, I should multiply the total kg by the price per kg. Let me write that down.\n\nTotal cost price (CP) is 450. Total quantity is 90 kg. Selling price per kg (SP per kg) is 7.50. So total SP would be 90 multiplied by 7.50. Let me calculate that. 90 times 7 is 630, and 90 times 0.5 is 45. So adding those together, 630 +45 = 675. So total SP is 675 rupees.\n\nNow, the profit would be SP minus CP. So 675 minus 450. That's 225. So the profit is 225 rupees. \n\nTo find the percentage gain, the formula is (Profit / CP) * 100. So plugging in the numbers: (225 / 450) *100. Let's compute that. 225 divided by 450 is 0.5. Multiply by 100 gives 50%. Wait, so that would be 50%? But let me check the options. Option A is 50%. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify again.\n\nWait, the calculation steps again. Total SP is 90 *7.50. Let me re-calculate that. 90 times 7 is indeed 630, and 90 times 0.5 is 45, so total is 675. Yes. Then CP is 450. Profit is 675 -450 = 225. Then (225/450)*100 is exactly 50%. So the answer should be A) 50%.\n\nHmm, but the options include 50% as A. So why is the question here? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. Oh, maybe I misread the question. Wait, the problem states \"sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg.\" So that's correct. So the total SP is indeed 90 multiplied by 7.50. So the calculation seems right. So the percentage gain is 50%. So the correct answer is A. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A to E, with A being 50%. That must be the answer. But maybe I made a mistake in division? Let me see 225 divided by 450. 450 divided by 2 is 225. So 225 is exactly half of 450, so 50% profit. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer is A.\n",
