      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a map and figuring out the actual distance between two towns. Let me see... The question says that the road from Town F to G is 20 inches on the map. And then it tells me that 1/4 inch on the map equals 10 miles in real life. Hmm, right. I need to find out how many miles that 20 inches actually is.\n\nAlright, first, I should figure out the scale of the map. The scale is given as 1/4 inch representing 10 miles. Wait, so maybe I can find out how many miles one inch represents? Because if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then multiplying both by 4 would give me the value for 1 inch. Let me do that calculation. \n\nSo, 1/4 inch = 10 miles. To get 1 inch, I multiply both sides by 4. That gives 1 inch equals 10 * 4, which is 40 miles. Oh, right! So each inch on the map is 40 actual miles. That makes sense. \n\nNow, the distance between the towns on the map is 20 inches. So if each inch is 40 miles, then 20 inches would be 20 times 40. Let me compute that. 20 multiplied by 40... Well, 20 times 40 is 800. So the actual distance should be 800 miles. Let me check the options. Option A is 800, so that's probably the answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mess up the scale. Let me think again. The 1/4 inch equals 10 miles. So per inch, how much? Let me do it another way. If 0.25 inches is 10 miles, then 1 inch is 10 divided by 0.25. Wait, no, actually, to get miles per inch, you divide the miles by the inches. So 10 miles divided by 0.25 inches equals... 10 divided by 0.25 is the same as 10 multiplied by 4, which is 40. Yeah, that's the same as before. So the scale is 40 miles per inch. \n\nThen 20 inches would be 20 times 40, which is indeed 800. Hmm. The options have A as 800, so that's the choice. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Let me read it again. \n\nThe problem states that \"1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles.\" So yeah, that's exactly how I used it. The map's scale is 1/4 inch to 10 miles. So the calculation seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe set up a proportion. Let's see. Let me write that out. Let x be the actual distance in miles. The ratio of map inches to real miles should be the same. So (1/4 inch)/10 miles = 20 inches/x miles. Wait, cross-multiplying gives (1/4) * x = 10 * 20. So (x)/4 = 200. Multiply both sides by 4: x= 800. Yep, same answer. \n\nSo that's definitely correct. The answer must be A)800. I don't see any other way this could be interpreted. The options don't have any other number close to that. The others are way higher. Like B is 720, which is 80 less. But unless I miscalculated... Wait, 20 times 40 is 800. 40 times 20: 40*20 is 800. Yeah. So yeah, I think that's solid. The answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem requires converting the map distance to actual distance using the given scale.

To find the number of miles per inch, multiply both sides of the scale by 4:  \n\\[\n1 \\text{ inch} = 10 \\text{ miles} \\times 4 = 40 \\text{ miles}.\n\\]  \nThe distance from Town F to Town G on the map is 20 inches.

The map shows the road as 20 inches long. The scale is that 1/4 inch represents 10 miles. Hmm, right, so I need to convert the map inches to real miles using that scale.\n\nFirst, maybe I should find out how many quarter inches are in 20 inches. Because the scale is given per 1/4 inch. Let's see, if 1/4 inch equals 10 miles, then each inch would be 4 times that, right? Because there are four quarters in an inch. So 10 miles multiplied by 4 would give the miles per inch. Wait, that might be a better approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set up a proportion. Let's see. The scale is 1/4 inch to 10 miles. So the ratio of map distance to actual is (1/4 inch) / (10 miles). But we need to find the actual distance when the map distance is 20 inches. So, setting up the proportion: (1/4)/10 = 20/x. Then solve for x?\n\nWait, proportions can sometimes be tricky. Let me make sure I get the ratio right. Since 1/4 inch on the map corresponds to 10 miles real, then 1 inch on the map would correspond to 10 * 4 = 40 miles. Oh right, that's another way. So each inch is 40 miles. Then 20 inches would be 20 * 40. Let me calculate that. 20 times 40 is 800. Hmm, so that would be 800 miles. So option A?\n\nBut wait, let me double-check using another method to be safe. Let's see, if 1/4 inch is 10 miles, then how many 1/4 inches are in 20 inches? Since each quarter is 0.25 inches, dividing 20 by 0.25 gives the number of quarter-inch segments. 20 divided by 0.25 is the same as 20 * 4, which is 80. Each of those segments is 10 miles, so 80 * 10 equals 800. Yep, same answer. So that's confirming it.\n\nLooking at the options, A is 800. So the answer should be A.
