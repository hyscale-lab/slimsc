      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so here's this problem about a train and its journey time. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the train's original speed is 100 miles per hour and it takes 10 hours to reach the destination normally. Wait, but then after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining and they have to slow down to 75 mph. The question is asking for the total journey duration now, right?\n\nAlright, first I need to find the total distance of the journey. Since the original speed is 100 mph and time is 10 hours, distance would be speed multiplied by time. So 100 times 10 is 1000 miles. Wait, that seems really long for a train trip, but maybe it's okay. Let me note that down: total distance is 1000 miles.\n\nNow, the train covers a quarter of that distance first at the original speed, then the rest at the slower speed. A quarter of 1000 is 250 miles. So the first part is 250 miles, and the remaining distance is 750 miles (since 1000 minus 250 is 750).\n\nFor the first part, the time taken would be distance divided by speed. So 250 divided by 100 mph. That's 2.5 hours. Got that part.\n\nThen, the second part is 750 miles at 75 mph. Time is distance over speed, so 750 divided by 75. Let me calculate that. 75 times 10 is 750, so that's 10 hours. Wait, so adding the two times: 2.5 + 10 equals 12.5 hours total. Hmm, so that would be option C?\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. Original total time was 10 hours. But now part of the trip is slower, so the total time must be longer than 10. 12.5 is longer, so that makes sense. Let me confirm the calculations again.\n\nTotal distance: 100 * 10 = 1000. Correct.\n\nQuarter distance: 250. Time first part: 250/100 = 2.5 hours.\n\nRemaining distance: 750. Time second part: 750 /75 = 10. Total time 12.5. So the answer should be C)12.5. Let me check the options. Yes, option C is 12.5. So that's the answer.\n",

So that would be 100 * 10 = 1000 miles? Wait, that seems a bit long, but maybe that's right. Let me check: 100 mph for 10 hours would indeed be 1000 miles. Okay, so total distance is 1000 miles.\n\nNow, the problem says after covering a quarter of the distance, the speed changes. A quarter of 1000 miles is 250 miles. So the first part is 250 miles at 100 mph, and the remaining three-quarters (which would be 750 miles) at 75 mph. Wait, three quarters? Because 1 - 1/4 is 3/4, right. So the remaining distance is 750 miles.\n\nLet me calculate the time taken for each part. The first part: time equals distance over speed. So 250 divided by 100. That's 2.5 hours. Then the second part is 750 divided by 75. Let me do that division. 75 times 10 is 750, so that would be 10 hours. Wait, no, 750 divided by 75 is 10? Wait, yes, because 75 times 10 is 750. So that part takes 10 hours. \n\nAdding both times together: 2.5 + 10 = 12.5 hours total. Hmm, so the total journey duration would be 12.5, which is option C. \n\nWait a second, let me double-check. The original time was 10 hours at constant speed. Now, part of the trip is slower, so the total time must be longer than 10. The options include 12.5 and 13.5, etc. So my calculation gives 12.5. Let me see again:\n\nTotal distance: 100 * 10 = 1000. Correct. \n\nQuarter distance: 250 miles. Time at 100 mph: 250/100 = 2.5 hours. \n\nRemaining distance: 750 miles.
