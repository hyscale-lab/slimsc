      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a rectangular piece of land that's 150 square meters. The question is asking for the perimeter, and they give some relationship between the length and the breadth. Let me see... The length is 1 meter more than four times the breadth. Hmm, right.\n\nAlright, let me start by recalling the formulas for area and perimeter of a rectangle. The area is length multiplied by breadth, so A = l * b. The perimeter is 2*(length + breadth). So I need to find the perimeter, but first I need to figure out the actual length and breadth.\n\nThe problem says the length is 1m more than four times the breadth. Let me write that down as an equation. Let's let the breadth be 'b' meters. Then the length 'l' would be 4b + 1. \n\nSo substituting into the area formula: l * b = 150. Plugging in l as 4b +1, that becomes (4b +1)*b =150. Let me expand that: 4b\u00b2 + b = 150. \n\nHmm, that gives me a quadratic equation. Let's rearrange it to standard form. Subtract 150 from both sides: 4b\u00b2 + b -150 =0. \n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic for b. Let me see if I can factor it. The coefficients are 4, 1, -150. The product of a and c is 4*(-150) = -600. So looking for two numbers that multiply to -600 and add up to 1 (the coefficient of the middle term). Hmm. Let me think: 25 and -24? 25 * (-24) = -600, and 25 -24 =1. Yes, that works. \n\nSo then I can split the middle term using these numbers. Let's rewrite the equation:\n\n4b\u00b2 +25b -24b -150 =0. \n\nGroup the first two and last two terms:\n\n(4b\u00b2 +25b) + (-24b -150) =0\n\nFactor out from the first group: b(4b +25) and the second group: -6(4b +25). Wait, let me check. Let me see:\n\nWait, the second group is -24b -150. Let me factor out a -6: -6*(4b +25)? Wait, 24 divided by 6 is 4, but 24b divided by -6 would be -4b. Hmm, maybe I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe split was 25b and -24b. So the equation is 4b\u00b2 +25b -24b -150 =0.\n\nGroup as (4b\u00b2 +25b) and (-24b -150). \n\nTake the first group: 4b\u00b2 +25b. The common factor is b, so factor that out: b(4b +25). \n\nSecond group: -24b -150. Let's see, the common factors here: 6 is a factor of both 24 and 150. Let's factor out -6: -6*(4b +25). Wait, because -24b divided by -6 is 4b, and -150 divided by -6 is 25. Yes, that works. \n\nSo now the equation becomes:\n\nb(4b +25) -6(4b +25) =0\n\nNow factor out (4b +25):\n\n(4b +25)(b -6) =0\n\nSo the solutions are when 4b +25=0 or b-6=0.\n\n4b +25 =0 \u2192 b = -25/4. That's negative, which doesn't make sense for a breadth. So we discard that.\n\nThe other solution is b=6. \n\nSo the breadth is 6 meters. Then the length is 4*6 +1 =24 +1 =25 meters. \n\nWait, let's check the area: 6 *25 =150. That's correct. \n\nNow, the perimeter is 2*(length + breadth). So 2*(25 +6)= 2*31 =62 meters. \n\nHmm, looking at the options, C is 62. So the answer should be C? But wait, let me double-check my math again. \n\nWait, perimeter calculation: 25+6 is 31, times 2 is 62. Yeah. So option C. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did the quadratic correctly. Let me go through the steps again. \n\nOriginal equation: (4b +1)*b =150 \u21924b\u00b2 +b =150 \u21924b\u00b2 +b -150=0. \n\nFactoring: looking for two numbers that multiply to (4)(-150)= -600 and add to +1. The numbers 25 and -24 do that. So splitting the middle term:\n\n4b\u00b2 +25b -24b -150 =0. Then grouping as (4b\u00b2 +25b) and (-24b -150). \n\nFactoring first group gives b(4b+25). Second group: -6*(4b +25). So yes, (4b+25)(b-6)=0. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check using the quadratic formula. Let's see. \n\nThe quadratic equation is 4b\u00b2 +b -150 =0. \n\nQuadratic formula: b = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Wait, variables here: a=4, b=1, c=-150. \n\nDiscriminant D = (1)^2 -4*4*(-150) =1 + 2400=2401. sqrt(2401)=49. \n\nSo b= [ -1 \u00b149 ]/(8). \n\nSo two solutions: \n\n(-1 +49)/8 =48/8=6. \n\n(-1-49)/8= -50/8= -6.25. \n\nSo same result. So breadth is 6. \n\nTherefore, perimeter is 2*(25+6)=62. So answer C. \n\nBut wait the options given are A)60, B)61, C)62, D)63, E)64. So C is correct. \n\nHmm, but why am I second-guessing? Maybe because sometimes there could be a miscalculation. Let me confirm once more. \n\nLength is 25, breadth 6. Perimeter is 2*(25 +6) = 2*(31) =62. Yep. So the answer should be C. \n",

Then grouping:\n\n(4b\u00b2 +25b) + (-24b -150) \u2192 \n\nFactor out b from first two terms: b(4b +25), and -6 from the last two terms: -6(4b +25). So yeah, (4b +25)(b -6). \n\nWait, but (b -6) multiplied by -6 gives -6*(4b+25). Wait, perhaps I should think of it as (4b +25)(b -6) =0. So the roots are b=6 and the other is negative. \n\nSo that's correct. So the breadth is 6. Length is 25. \n\nPerimeter: 2*(25 +6) = 2*31=62. So the answer should be C)62 m. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options given are A)60, B)61, C)62, D)63, E)64. So C is there. \n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic solving. Let me try using the quadratic formula to confirm. \n\nThe quadratic equation is 4b\u00b2 +b -150 =0. \n\nQuadratic formula: b = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Wait, coefficients: a=4, b=1, c=-150. \n\nDiscriminant: (1)^2 -4*4*(-150) =1 + 2400=2401. Square root of 2401 is 49. \n\nSo, b = [ -1 \u00b149 ]/(8). \n\nTaking the positive solution: (-1 +49)/8 =48/8=6. Which matches. The other solution is negative. \n\nSo yes, correct. So the answer is 62. So option C. \n\nHmm, but why is option B 61? Maybe I miscalculated the perimeter? Let me check again. \n\nLength is 25, breadth 6. Perimeter is 2*(25 +6)=2*(31)=62. Yes, that's right. So the correct answer must be C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the breadth be \\( b \\) meters. The length is given as \\( 4b + 1 \\) meters. The area of the rectangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\text{length} \\times \\text{breadth} = (4b + 1) \\times b = 150\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to the quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\n4b^2 + b - 150 = 0\n\\]\n\nUsing the quadratic formula \\( b = \\frac{-B \\pm \\sqrt{B^2 - 4AC}}{2A} \\) where \\( A = 4 \\), \\( B = 1 \\), and \\( C = -150 \\):\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 2400}}{8} = \\frac{-1 \\pm 49}{8}\n\\]\n\nThe positive solution is:\n\n\\[\nb = \\frac{48}{8} = 6 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThe length is then:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Length} = 4(6) + 1 = 25 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = 2(\\text{length} + \\text{breadth}) = 2(25 + 6) = 2 \\times 31 = 62 \\text{ meters}\n\\]\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C)62 m**.\n\nAnswer: C",
