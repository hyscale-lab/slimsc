      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this math problem: 900 plus 5 times 12. Hmm, let me think. Wait, the question is 900 + 5 \u00d7 12. Right, I remember that multiplication comes before addition in the order of operations. So first, I should calculate the 5 multiplied by 12 part. Let me do that. 5 times 12 is... 5 times 10 is 50, plus 5 times 2 is 10, so 60. Oh right, 5\u00d712=60. Then add that to 900. So 900 plus 60. That should be 960. Let me check the options. Option E is 960. So the answer must be E. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. If someone just did 900 +5 first, that would be 905 times 12, which is way bigger, but that's not the case here. Since multiplication has higher precedence, yeah, I did it right. So the correct answer is E)960.\n",

Hmm, right, I remember that in math problems like this, you have to follow the order of operations. Wait, what's the order again? Oh right, parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So PEMDAS. So first, I should do the multiplication part before the addition.\n\nAlright, so the problem is 900 + 5 \u00d7 12. Let me calculate the 5 multiplied by 12 first. 5 times 12 is... 60, right? Because 5 times 10 is 50 and 5 times 2 is 10, so 50 + 10 = 60. Then I add that result to 900. So 900 plus 60 equals 960. Let me check the options. Option E is 960. So the answer should be E?\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the order. If someone just did 900 plus 5 first, that would be 905 times 12, which would be a huge number, but that's not the case here. Since multiplication comes first, yeah, the correct way is multiplying first. So yeah, 5\u00d712 is 60, plus 900 is 960. Looking at the options again: E is 960, so that must be the right answer. The other options don't make sense. Like option A is 820, which would be if you subtracted maybe, but no. So I think I'm confident here.\n",
