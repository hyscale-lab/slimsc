      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem about points on a circle. The question is about finding the measure of minor arc AD. Hmm, points A, B, C, D are in order on the circumference. The given information is that minor arc AC is 160\u00b0, minor arc BD is 150\u00b0, and B bisects the minor arc AC. I need to figure out the measure of arc AD.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the circle with points A, B, C, D placed in that order. Since B bisects minor arc AC, that means the arc AB is equal to arc BC. The total arc AC is 160\u00b0, so each of those arcs AB and BC must be half of that. So AB = BC = 80\u00b0 each. That makes sense so far.\n\nNow, the points are in order A, B, C, D. So after point C comes D. The question is asking about the minor arc AD. To find that, maybe I need to add up the arcs from A to D through B and C? Wait, but I need to check if that's the minor arc or the major arc. Since it's specified as minor arc AD, it's the shorter path from A to D. \n\nLet me think. Let's note down what we know:\n\n- Arc AC = 160\u00b0, so AB = BC = 80\u00b0 each (because B bisects AC).\n- Arc BD is given as 150\u00b0. Hmm, BD is another arc. Since the points are in order A-B-C-D, BD would be from B to D. So BD is the arc passing through C, right? Because moving from B to D in order would go through C. So the arc BD would be BC plus CD. Wait, that's possible.\n\nWait, BD is a minor arc. So if BD is 150\u00b0, then BC + CD = 150\u00b0. But we know BC is 80\u00b0, so CD would be 150 - 80 = 70\u00b0, right?\n\nSo CD is 70\u00b0. \n\nNow, to find arc AD, which is from A to D. The path would be A to B to C to D. So adding AB + BC + CD. AB is 80, BC is 80, CD is 70. So total would be 80 + 80 +70 = 230. Wait, but that's the major arc AD, because 230 is more than 180. But the question asks for the minor arc AD. Hmm, so maybe I'm making a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the path from A to D is the other way around the circle? But since points are in order A-B-C-D on the circumference, the minor arc AD would be the shorter path. Wait, maybe I need to think of the circle as 360 degrees. Let me try to structure this step by step.\n\nLet me assign variables to the arcs to make it clearer.\n\nLet me denote the arcs:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the arcs as follows:\n\nArc AB = x, Arc BC = x (since B bisects AC, so x + x = 160\u00b0, so each is 80\u00b0, as before).\n\nThen, arc BD is given as 150\u00b0. Arc BD would be from B to D. Since the points are A-B-C-D, the minor arc BD would pass through C. So BD is BC + CD. So BC is x (80\u00b0), so CD must be 150 - x = 150 -80 =70\u00b0, so CD=70\u00b0.\n\nSo the arcs so far are AB=80, BC=80, CD=70. Now, what's left is the arc DA? Wait, but the total circle is 360\u00b0, so the remaining arc after D back to A would be the arc DA? Wait, maybe I need to think of the entire circle.\n\nWait, let me see. The total of all arcs must add up to 360\u00b0. The arcs between the points are AB (80), BC (80), CD (70), and DA (unknown). Wait, but the order is A-B-C-D, so after D comes A again. So the total of these four arcs should be 360\u00b0. Let me check:\n\nAB + BC + CD + DA = 80 +80 +70 + DA = 230 + DA = 360. So DA would be 130\u00b0? Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, that's the arc from D to A, which would be the same as the minor arc AD? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the arc DA (from D to A) is the same as the minor arc AD. Because arc AD is the same as DA, just direction reversed. So the measure would be the same. So if DA is 130\u00b0, then AD is 130\u00b0, which would be the minor arc if that's the shorter path. Wait, but let me see:\n\nThe total circumference is 360. The other path from A to D would be going the other way around the circle, which would be through B and C. Which is 80+80+70=230, which is the major arc. So the minor arc AD would be the shorter of 130 and 230, so 130\u00b0, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me double-check because I might have messed up the arcs. Let me confirm again.\n\nAB is 80, BC is 80, CD is 70. So the total of AB + BC + CD is 230. So the remaining arc DA must be 360 -230 = 130. Since that's the arc from D to A, which is the same as minor arc AD. Since 130 is less than 180, it's indeed the minor arc. So the answer should be B)130\u00b0.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Another way: since B bisects AC, so AB and BC are each 80. BD is 150\u00b0, which is from B to D. The arc BD includes BC and CD. So BD's measure is BC + CD = 80 + CD =150, so CD is 70. So the arcs:\n\nAB=80, BC=80, CD=70. Then DA is the remaining arc. Since the total is 360, DA = 360 - (80+80+70) = 360-230=130. So yes, that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the order of the points. The points are A, B, C, D in order on the circumference. So the arcs between them are AB, BC, CD, DA. So adding those gives the full circle. So the calculation is correct. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 130\u00b0, which is option B. So the answer should be B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that point B bisects the minor arc AC, which measures 160\u00b0. This means each of the arcs AB and BC is \\( \\frac{160\u00b0}{2} = 80\u00b0 \\). \n\nNext, we consider the minor arc BD, which is given as 150\u00b0. Since the points are in the order A-B-C-D on the circumference, the minor arc BD must pass through C. Therefore, the arc BD is the sum of arcs BC and CD.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's try to figure this problem out step by step. So, we have four points A, B, C, D placed in order on a circle. The question gives us some information about the arcs and asks for the measure of minor arc AD. Let me jot down the given data first.\n\nFirst, minor arc AC is 160 degrees. Then, minor arc BD is 150 degrees. Also, it says that point B bisects the minor arc AC. Hmm, so that means B is exactly halfway between A and C along the minor arc AC. Since arc AC is 160\u00b0, each of the arcs AB and BC should be half of that, right? So each would be 80 degrees. That makes sense because bisecting would split it into two equal parts.\n\nSo, arc AB is 80\u00b0, arc BC is also 80\u00b0, adding up to 160\u00b0, which matches the given. Now, we need to find the measure of minor arc AD. Let me visualize this. The points are in order A, B, C, D on the circumference. Wait, so the order is important here. Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Let's imagine the circle with points A, then B, then C, then D going around. \n\nNow, since B is the midpoint of arc AC, that's clear. The next piece of information is that minor arc BD is 150\u00b0. Hmm, BD is another arc. Since B and D are two points, and BD is a minor arc, which is 150 degrees. So the arc from B to D (going the shorter way around the circle) is 150 degrees. \n\nThe question is asking for the measure of minor arc AD. So, we need to find the length from A to D along the minor arc. To do this, perhaps we can figure out the positions of all the points and the lengths of the arcs between them?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider the circle's circumference as 360 degrees. Let's assign variables to the arcs between the points. Let me denote the arcs as follows:\n\n- Arc AB is 80\u00b0, since B bisects AC. So AB = 80\u00b0, BC = 80\u00b0, as we said before.\n- Then, after point C comes D. So the next arc would be CD. But we don't know its measure yet. Let's call that x degrees. Then the arc from D back to A would be another arc, but since the points are in order A, B, C, D, the remaining arc after D would be DA? Wait, no. Wait, the full circle is 360. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the order is A, B, C, D on the circumference. So the arcs between them are AB, BC, CD, and DA. So the total circumference is AB + BC + CD + DA = 360\u00b0. \n\nWe know AB is 80\u00b0, BC is 80\u00b0, so that's 160\u00b0, so the remaining arcs CD + DA must add up to 200\u00b0. But we need more information.\n\nThe other given is that the minor arc BD is 150\u00b0. Let's see where BD is. Since B is between A and C, and D is after C, the minor arc BD would go from B through C and D? Or maybe the other way? Wait, BD could be the shorter path from B to D. Let me see.\n\nThe points in order are A, B, C, D. So if we go from B to D along the minor arc, that path would be through C and D, right? Because moving forward from B to C is 80\u00b0, then C to D is some x, so BD would be BC + CD. Since BD is given as 150\u00b0, that would mean BC (80\u00b0) plus CD equals 150\u00b0, so CD would be 150 -80 = 70\u00b0. Wait, but that's assuming the minor arc BD is indeed going through C and D. Alternatively, maybe the minor arc BD could go the other way around the circle, but that might be longer.\n\nWait, the problem states that minor arc BD is 150\u00b0, so it's the smaller of the two possible arcs between B and D. Let me confirm the possible lengths. The total circle is 360\u00b0, so the major arc BD would be 360 - 150 = 210\u00b0, so the minor is indeed 150\u00b0. So the minor arc BD is the shorter path. Since the points are in order A-B-C-D, the path from B to D going forward (through C) would be BC + CD, which is 80 + CD. The other path would be going the other way from B through A to D, which would be BA + AD. Since BA is 80\u00b0, and AD is the arc we need to find. Let me denote the arc AD as y, then that path would be 80 + y. \n\nSince BD's minor arc is 150\u00b0, whichever path is shorter must be 150. So, between (BC + CD) and (BA + AD), whichever is smaller is 150. \n\nWe have to figure out which is the shorter path. Let me see. Let me suppose that the minor arc BD is going through C and D. So that BC + CD = 150. Since BC is 80\u00b0, that gives CD = 70\u00b0. Then, the other path (BA + AD) would be 80 + y. Let's see if that's longer than 150. Well, if CD is 70\u00b0, then the total circumference would be 80 (AB) + 80 (BC) +70 (CD) + DA (arc DA) = 230 + DA. The total must be 360, so DA would be 360 -230 = 130\u00b0. So DA would be 130\u00b0, so the path BA + AD is 80 (BA) + 130 (AD) = 210\u00b0, which is longer than 150\u00b0, so that checks out. So in that case, the minor arc BD is indeed the 150\u00b0, and the other path is 210\u00b0, which is major. So that works.\n\nAlternatively, if the minor arc BD was going the other way (BA + AD), then that path would have to be 150\u00b0, so 80 + y = 150, so y =70. Then CD would be 360 - (AB+BC + AD) = 360 - (80 +80 +70) = 360 - 230 = 130. Then BD going through C and D would be BC + CD = 80 +130=210\u00b0, which is major. But in that case, the minor arc BD would be the 150\u00b0 path through A and D. But the problem states that the points are in order A,B,C,D on the circumference, so the minor arc BD is likely the one going through C and D, since that's the adjacent direction. But maybe we need to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem doesn't specify the direction, so we have to consider both possibilities. Hmm, but maybe the way the points are arranged in order, the minor arc BD is indeed through C and D. Let me proceed with the first scenario where CD is 70\u00b0, so DA would be 130\u00b0, which would be the measure of arc AD. Since the question asks for minor arc AD. \n\nWait, arc AD could be the minor or major. Let me see. Since the points are in order A, B, C, D, the minor arc AD would be the shorter path between A and D. Let's see: the path from A to D going through B and C would be AB + BC + CD = 80 +80 +70 = 230\u00b0, while the other path is directly AD, which is 130\u00b0, so that's the minor arc. So that would make the answer 130\u00b0, which is option B. \n\nWait, but let me check the other scenario again. Suppose that the minor arc BD is going the other way (BA + AD =150), so then AD would be 70\u00b0, but then the arc from A to D would be 70\u00b0, which is minor, and the other path would be 290\u00b0, which is major. But in that case, CD would be 130\u00b0, so BD going through C and D would be 80+130=210\u00b0, which is major, so the minor arc BD would be the 150\u00b0 path. So in that case, the answer would be AD=70\u00b0, but that's not one of the options. The options are 80,130,140,160,220. So 70 isn't there, so that scenario can't be correct. Therefore, the first scenario must be the right one, so AD is 130\u00b0, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck all steps again.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Points in order A, B, C, D on the circumference.\n\n- Minor arc AC is 160\u00b0, so the arc from A to C is 160\u00b0, which is split by B since B bisects it. Therefore, AB = BC = 80\u00b0 each.\n\n- Minor arc BD is 150\u00b0. Need to find minor arc AD.\n\nLet me consider the circle's total circumference is 360\u00b0. Let me denote the arcs between the points:\n\nAB = 80\u00b0, BC = 80\u00b0, CD = x\u00b0, DA = y\u00b0. \n\nTotal: 80 +80 +x + y = 360 \u21d2 x + y = 200.\n\nNow, the minor arc BD is 150\u00b0. The arc BD can be measured in two ways: either the path going through C and D (which is BC + CD = 80 + x) or the path going the other way through A and D (which is BA + DA = 80 + y). \n\nSince it's the minor arc, we need the shorter of these two paths to equal 150\u00b0. Let's consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: 80 + x = 150 \u21d2 x =70. Then y = 200 -x =130. \n\nThe other path would be 80 + y = 80 +130 = 210. Since 150 is shorter than 210, this is valid. So this is acceptable.\n\nCase 2: 80 + y =150 \u21d2 y=70. Then x=200 -70 =130. \n\nThe other path would be 80 +x = 80+130=210. Again, 150 is shorter, so this is also valid. Wait, so both cases are possible? But how?\n\nWait, but in this case, the positions of D would be different. Let me see.\n\nWait, in case 1, CD is 70\u00b0, so the order is A, B (80), C (another 80), then D is 70\u00b0 from C. So the total from A to D through B and C is 80+80+70 =230\u00b0, which is more than 180\u00b0, so the minor arc AD would be the other way, which is y =130\u00b0, which is correct. \n\nIn case 2, CD is 130\u00b0, so the path from B to D through C and D would be 80+130=210\u00b0, which is major, so the minor arc BD is the other path (BA+AD)=80 +70=150\u00b0, which is valid. But then the minor arc AD would be 70\u00b0, but that's not an option. Since the options don't include 70, case 2 can't be correct, so case 1 must be the right one. Hence, AD is 130\u00b0, so the answer is B.\n\nWait, but the problem states the points are in order A, B, C, D on the circumference. So if in case 2, CD is 130\u00b0, then the order is still A,B,C,D. Because the points are placed in order around the circle, so even if CD is large, the positions are maintained. But the problem's options don't have 70, so case 2 is impossible. Thus, case 1 must hold, so AD is 130\u00b0, option B.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B)130\u00b0.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that point B bisects the minor arc AC, which is 160\u00b0.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to figure this problem out step by step. So, we have four points A, B, C, D placed in order on a circle. The question gives us some information about the arcs and asks for the measure of minor arc AD. Let me jot down the given data first.\n\nFirst, minor arc AC is 160 degrees. Then, minor arc BD is 150 degrees. Also, it says that point B bisects the minor arc AC. Hmm, so that means B is exactly halfway between A and C along the minor arc AC. Since arc AC is 160\u00b0, each of the arcs AB and BC should be half of that, right? So each would be 80 degrees. That makes sense because bisecting would split it into two equal parts.\n\nSo, arc AB is 80\u00b0, arc BC is also 80\u00b0, adding up to 160\u00b0, which matches the given. Now, we need to find the measure of minor arc AD. Let me visualize this. The points are in order A, B, C, D on the circumference. Wait, so the order is important here. Let me sketch a rough diagram mentally. Let's imagine the circle with points A, then B, then C, then D going around. \n\nNow, since B is the midpoint of arc AC, that's clear. The next piece of information is that minor arc BD is 150\u00b0. Hmm, BD is another arc. Since B and D are two points, and BD is a minor arc, which is 150 degrees. So the arc from B to D (going the shorter way around the circle) is 150 degrees. \n\nThe question is asking for the measure of minor arc AD. So, we need to find the length from A to D along the minor arc. To do this, perhaps we can figure out the positions of all the points and the lengths of the arcs between them?\n\nLet me think. Let's consider the circle's circumference as 360 degrees. Let's assign variables to the arcs between the points. Let me denote the arcs as follows:\n\n- Arc AB is 80\u00b0, since B bisects AC. So AB = 80\u00b0, BC = 80\u00b0, as we said before.\n- Then, after point C comes D. So the next arc would be CD. But we don't know its measure yet. Let's call that x degrees. Then the arc from D back to A would be another arc, but since the points are in order A, B, C, D, the remaining arc after D would be DA? Wait, no. Wait, the full circle is 360. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the order is A, B, C, D on the circumference. So the arcs between them are AB, BC, CD, and DA. So the total circumference is AB + BC + CD + DA = 360\u00b0. \n\nWe know AB is 80\u00b0, BC is 80\u00b0, so that's 160\u00b0, so the remaining arcs CD + DA must add up to 200\u00b0. But we need more information.\n\nThe other given is that the minor arc BD is 150\u00b0. Let's see where BD is. Since B is between A and C, and D is after C, the minor arc BD would go from B through C and D? Or maybe the other way? Wait, BD could be the shorter path from B to D. Let me see.\n\nThe points in order are A, B, C, D. So if we go from B to D along the minor arc, that path would be through C and D, right? Because moving forward from B to C is 80\u00b0, then C to D is some x, so BD would be BC + CD. Since BD is given as 150\u00b0, that would mean BC (80\u00b0) plus CD equals 150\u00b0, so CD would be 150 -80 = 70\u00b0. Wait, but that's assuming the minor arc BD is indeed going through C and D. Alternatively, maybe the minor arc BD could go the other way around the circle, but that might be longer.\n\nWait, the problem states that minor arc BD is 150\u00b0, so it's the smaller of the two possible arcs between B and D. Let me confirm the possible lengths. The total circle is 360\u00b0, so the major arc BD would be 360 - 150 = 210\u00b0, so the minor is indeed 150\u00b0. So the minor arc BD is the shorter path. Since the points are in order A-B-C-D, the path from B to D going forward (through C) would be BC + CD, which is 80 + CD. The other path would be going the other way from B through A to D, which would be BA + AD. Since BA is 80\u00b0, and AD is the arc we need to find. Let me denote the arc AD as y, then that path would be 80 + y. \n\nSince BD's minor arc is 150\u00b0, whichever path is shorter must be 150. So, between (BC + CD) and (BA + AD), whichever is smaller is 150. \n\nWe have to figure out which is the shorter path. Let me see. Let me suppose that the minor arc BD is going through C and D. So that BC + CD = 150. Since BC is 80\u00b0, that gives CD = 70\u00b0. Then, the other path (BA + AD) would be 80 + y. Let's see if that's longer than 150. Well, if CD is 70\u00b0, then the total circumference would be 80 (AB) + 80 (BC) +70 (CD) + DA (arc DA) = 230 + DA. The total must be 360, so DA would be 360 -230 = 130\u00b0. So DA would be 130\u00b0, so the path BA + AD is 80 (BA) + 130 (AD) = 210\u00b0, which is longer than 150\u00b0, so that checks out. So in that case, the minor arc BD is indeed the 150\u00b0, and the other path is 210\u00b0, which is major. So that works.\n\nAlternatively, if the minor arc BD was going the other way (BA + AD), then that path would have to be 150\u00b0, so 80 + y = 150, so y =70. Then CD would be 360 - (AB+BC + AD) = 360 - (80 +80 +70) = 360 - 230 = 130. Then BD going through C and D would be BC + CD = 80 +130=210\u00b0, which is major. But in that case, the minor arc BD would be the 150\u00b0 path through A and D. But the problem states that the points are in order A,B,C,D on the circumference, so the minor arc BD is likely the one going through C and D, since that's the adjacent direction. But maybe we need to confirm.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem doesn't specify the direction, so we have to consider both possibilities. Hmm, but maybe the way the points are arranged in order, the minor arc BD is indeed through C and D. Let me proceed with the first scenario where CD is 70\u00b0, so DA would be 130\u00b0, which would be the measure of arc AD. Since the question asks for minor arc AD. \n\nWait, arc AD could be the minor or major. Let me see. Since the points are in order A, B, C, D, the minor arc AD would be the shorter path between A and D. Let's see: the path from A to D going through B and C would be AB + BC + CD = 80 +80 +70 = 230\u00b0, while the other path is directly AD, which is 130\u00b0, so that's the minor arc. So that would make the answer 130\u00b0, which is option B. \n\nWait, but let me check the other scenario again. Suppose that the minor arc BD is going the other way (BA + AD =150), so then AD would be 70\u00b0, but then the arc from A to D would be 70\u00b0, which is minor, and the other path would be 290\u00b0, which is major. But in that case, CD would be 130\u00b0, so BD going through C and D would be 80+130=210\u00b0, which is major, so the minor arc BD would be the 150\u00b0 path. So in that case, the answer would be AD=70\u00b0, but that's not one of the options. The options are 80,130,140,160,220. So 70 isn't there, so that scenario can't be correct. Therefore, the first scenario must be the right one, so AD is 130\u00b0, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recheck all steps again.\n\nGiven:\n\n- Points in order A, B, C, D on the circumference.\n\n- Minor arc AC is 160\u00b0, so the arc from A to C is 160\u00b0, which is split by B since B bisects it. Therefore, AB = BC = 80\u00b0 each.\n\n- Minor arc BD is 150\u00b0. Need to find minor arc AD.\n\nLet me consider the circle's total circumference is 360\u00b0. Let me denote the arcs between the points:\n\nAB = 80\u00b0, BC = 80\u00b0, CD = x\u00b0, DA = y\u00b0. \n\nTotal: 80 +80 +x + y = 360 \u21d2 x + y = 200.\n\nNow, the minor arc BD is 150\u00b0. The arc BD can be measured in two ways: either the path going through C and D (which is BC + CD = 80 + x) or the path going the other way through A and D (which is BA + DA = 80 + y). \n\nSince it's the minor arc, we need the shorter of these two paths to equal 150\u00b0. Let's consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: 80 + x = 150 \u21d2 x =70. Then y = 200 -x =130. \n\nThe other path would be 80 + y = 80 +130 = 210. Since 150 is shorter than 210, this is valid. So this is acceptable.\n\nCase 2: 80 + y =150 \u21d2 y=70. Then x=200 -70 =130. \n\nThe other path would be 80 +x = 80+130=210. Again, 150 is shorter, so this is also valid. Wait, so both cases are possible? But how?\n\nWait, but in this case, the positions of D would be different. Let me see.\n\nWait, in case 1, CD is 70\u00b0, so the order is A, B (80), C (another 80), then D is 70\u00b0 from C. So the total from A to D through B and C is 80+80+70 =230\u00b0, which is more than 180\u00b0, so the minor arc AD would be the other way, which is y =130\u00b0, which is correct. \n\nIn case 2, CD is 130\u00b0, so the path from B to D through C and D would be 80+130=210\u00b0, which is major, so the minor arc BD is the other path (BA+AD)=80 +70=150\u00b0, which is valid. But then the minor arc AD would be 70\u00b0, but that's not an option. Since the options don't include 70, case 2 can't be correct, so case 1 must be the right one. Hence, AD is 130\u00b0, so the answer is B.\n\nWait, but the problem states the points are in order A, B, C, D on the circumference. So if in case 2, CD is 130\u00b0, then the order is still A,B,C,D. Because the points are placed in order around the circle, so even if CD is large, the positions are maintained. But the problem's options don't have 70, so case 2 is impossible. Thus, case 1 must hold, so AD is 130\u00b0, option B.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B)130\u00b0.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that point B bisects the minor arc AC, which is 160\u00b0. This means arc AB and arc BC are each \\( \\frac{160\u00b0}{2} = 80\u00b0 \\). \n\nNext, we consider the given minor arc BD of 150\u00b0. Since the points are in the order A, B, C, D on the circumference, the minor arc BD can be either the path from B to D through C and D or the path from B to D through A and D. We need to determine which path corresponds to the minor arc (150\u00b0).\n\nLet \\( x \\) be the measure of arc CD and \\( y \\) be the measure of arc DA. The total circumference of the circle is 360\u00b0, so we have:\n\\[\nAB + BC + CD + DA = 80\u00b0 + 80\u00b0 + x + y = 360\u00b0 \\implies x + y = 200\u00b0.\n\\]\n\n**Case 1:** The minor arc BD is the path through C and D:\n\\[\nBC + CD = 80\u00b0 + x = 150\u00b0 \\implies x = 70\u00b0.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( x = 70\u00b0 \\) into \\( x + y = 200\u00b0 \\):\n\\[\n70\u00b0 + y = 200\u00b0 \\implies y = 130\u00b0.\n\\]\nThe other path (BA + AD) would be \\( 80\u00b0 + 130\u00b0 = 210\u00b0 \\), which is longer than 150\u00b0, confirming that the minor arc BD is indeed through C and D. Thus, arc DA (minor arc AD) is \\( 130\u00b0 \\).\n\n**Case 2:** The minor arc BD is the path through A and D:\n\\[\nBA + AD = 80\u00b0 + y = 150\u00b0 \\implies y = 70\u00b0.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( y = 70\u00b0 \\) into \\( x + y = 200\u00b0 \\):\n\\[\nx = 130\u00b0.\n\\]\nThe other path (BC + CD) would be \\( 80\u00b0 + 130\u00b0 = 210\u00b0 \\), which is longer. However, \\( y = 70\u00b0 \\) is not an option provided, so this case is invalid.\n\nThus, the valid solution is \\( y = 130\u00b0 \\), corresponding to the minor arc AD.
