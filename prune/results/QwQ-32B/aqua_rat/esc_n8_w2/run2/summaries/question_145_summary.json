      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the ratio of the volume of a cube to the volume of the sphere that fits inside it. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the cube's volume compared to the sphere that's inscribed within it. Right, because the sphere that fits inside the cube would touch the cube exactly at the centers of each face. So the diameter of the sphere must be equal to the edge length of the cube. \n\nLet me start by recalling the formulas. The volume of a cube is edge length cubed, so V_cube = a\u00b3 where a is the edge length. The sphere that fits inside the cube has a diameter equal to the edge length of the cube. So the radius of the sphere would be half of that, so r = a/2. \n\nThe volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Plugging the radius into that formula gives V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)\u00b3. Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, (a/2) cubed is (a\u00b3)/(8). Then multiply that by 4/3 \u03c0. So the sphere's volume becomes (4/3 \u03c0)*(a\u00b3/8) = (4/(3*8)) \u03c0 a\u00b3 = (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6. \n\nSo the cube's volume is a\u00b3, and the sphere's is (\u03c0/6)a\u00b3. The ratio of cube to sphere would be a\u00b3 divided by (\u03c0/6 a\u00b3). The a\u00b3 terms cancel out, so that leaves 1 divided by (\u03c0/6) which is 6/\u03c0. Wait, but the question says the ratio of cube to sphere, so that would be 6:\u03c0. Let me check the options. Option D is 6:\u03c0. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. The question says \"the ratio of the volumes of a cube to that of the sphere\". So cube first, sphere second. So 6 over \u03c0, which is 6:\u03c0. So D is correct. \n\nLooking at the options again: A is 2:\u03c0, B is 7:2, C is 8:2 (which simplifies to 4:1 but maybe that's a trick?), D is 6:\u03c0, E is 8:3. So yes, D must be the right answer. \n\nI think that's all. Let me just double-check my sphere volume calculation. Volume of sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. With r = a/2, so substituting: (4/3)\u03c0*(a\u00b3/8) = (4/(24)) \u03c0 a\u00b3? Wait, 4 divided by 8 is 0.5, so 4/(3*8) is 4/24 = 1/6. Right, so yes, (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6. So the ratio is a\u00b3 divided by (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6) equals 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6 to \u03c0, which is exactly option D. Yep, that's solid. The other options don't make sense. Like option E is 8:3, which would be if maybe someone thought the diameter was different, but no. So D is correct.\n",

Hmm, I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the scenario. The cube and a sphere inside it. The sphere that fits inside the cube must be the inscribed sphere, right? That means the sphere touches the cube exactly at the centers of each face. So the diameter of the sphere is equal to the edge length of the cube. Oh right, because if the sphere is perfectly fitting inside, its diameter can't be longer than the cube's edge. So the diameter is exactly equal to the edge length.\n\nLet me denote the edge length of the cube as 'a'. Then the volume of the cube is straightforward: it's a cubed, so V_cube = a\u00b3.\n\nNow, for the sphere. Since the sphere is inscribed, its diameter equals the edge length of the cube. So the diameter of the sphere is 'a', which means the radius r is a/2. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. Plugging in the radius, that would be (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)\u00b3.\n\nLet me compute that. The (a/2)\u00b3 part is a\u00b3/8. So multiplying that by 4/3 gives (4/3)*(a\u00b3/8) = (4a\u00b3)/(24) = a\u00b3/6. So the sphere's volume is (\u03c0 * a\u00b3)/6? Wait, hold on, no. Wait, the (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)^3. Let me recalculate that again:\n\nSphere volume V_sphere = (4/3)\u03c0*( (a/2) )^3. Let's compute (a/2)^3: that's a\u00b3/8. Multiply by 4/3: (4/3)*(a\u00b3/8) = (4a\u00b3)/(24) = a\u00b3/6. So yes, V_sphere = (\u03c0 * a\u00b3)/6? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. So substituting r = a/2 gives (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)^3. So yes, the calculation is correct. So the sphere's volume is (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6 multiplied by (4/3)? Wait, no, I think I messed up the calculation steps. Let me redo that.\n\nWait, (a/2)^3 is a\u00b3/8. Then multiply that by 4/3: (4/3)*(a\u00b3/8) = (4a\u00b3)/(24) which simplifies to a\u00b3/6. So the sphere's volume is (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)^3 = (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6? Wait, no, wait, the 4/3 times (a^3/8) would be (4/(3*8)) = 4/24 = 1/6. So yes, so the sphere's volume is (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6? Wait, but the 4/3 is multiplied by \u03c0 and the (a/2)^3. So yeah, the final volume is (4/3) * \u03c0 * (a\u00b3/8) = (4\u03c0 a\u00b3)/(24) = \u03c0 a\u00b3 /6. Right. So that's correct.\n\nSo the cube's volume is a\u00b3, the sphere's is \u03c0 a\u00b3/6. So the ratio of cube's volume to sphere's is a\u00b3 divided by (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6). The a\u00b3 terms cancel out, so that's 1 divided by (\u03c0/6), which is 6/\u03c0. So the ratio is 6 : \u03c0. Wait, but the question is asking for the ratio of the cube to the sphere. So cube volume : sphere volume = 6:\u03c0. Looking at the options, option D is 6:\u03c0. So that would be the answer?\n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are A)2:\u03c0, B)7:2, C)8:2, D)6:\u03c0, E)8:3. So D is indeed 6:\u03c0, so that's the one. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, maybe I made a mistake in the sphere's volume? Let me check the formula again. The formula for sphere volume is (4/3)\u03c0r\u00b3. The radius here is a/2. So substituting gives (4/3)\u03c0*(a/2)^3. Yes. So (a/2)^3 is a\u00b3/8. 4/3 times a\u00b3/8 is (4a\u00b3)/(24) which reduces to a\u00b3/6. So sphere's volume is (\u03c0 a\u00b3)/6 multiplied by 4/3? Wait, no. Wait, the 4/3 and the 1/8 multiply to (4/24) which is 1/6. So the sphere's volume is (4/3)*(\u03c0)*(a\u00b3/8) = \u03c0 a\u00b3 /6. So the ratio is cube (a\u00b3) divided by sphere (\u03c0 a\u00b3/6) equals 6/\u03c0. So cube to sphere ratio is 6:\u03c0. So D is correct. \n\nHmm, but wait another thought: could there be a different way the sphere is placed? Like maybe the sphere is not inscribed but something else? But the question says \"the sphere which will fit inside the cube\", which implies the largest possible sphere that can fit inside, which is the inscribed sphere. So the diameter equals the edge length. So that part is correct.\n\nAnother check: Let me take an example. Suppose the edge length is 2 units. Then the cube's volume is 8. The sphere's radius is 1, so volume is (4/3)\u03c0(1)^3 = 4\u03c0/3. So the ratio is 8 : (4\u03c0/3) = 8 * 3/(4\u03c0) = 24/(4\u03c0) = 6/\u03c0. So 6:\u03c0. Exactly the same. So that's correct.
