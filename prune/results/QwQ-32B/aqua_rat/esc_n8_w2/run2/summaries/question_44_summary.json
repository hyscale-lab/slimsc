      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find a 5-digit number such that when I put a 1 after it (like appending 1), the number becomes three times as large as when I put a 1 before it (prefixing 1). Hmm, the question is a bit tricky, but let's break it down.\n\nLet me denote the 5-digit number as N. Let's think about what appending and prepending 1 does numerically. \n\nIf I append a 1 to N, that's like multiplying N by 10 and adding 1. So, the new number would be 10*N + 1.\n\nOn the other hand, prepending a 1 would mean creating a new 6-digit number where 1 is the first digit. So, that's 1 followed by N, which mathematically is 100000 + N, since N is 5 digits. \n\nThe problem states that the number with 1 after it (the appended case) is three times as large as the one with 1 before it (prepended case). So the equation would be:\n\n10*N + 1 = 3*(100000 + N)\n\nLet me write that out again to make sure. The equation is:\n\n10N + 1 = 3*(100000 + N)\n\nNow, I can solve for N. Let's expand the right-hand side:\n\n10N +1 = 300000 + 3N\n\nSubtract 3N from both sides:\n\n7N +1 = 300000\n\nThen subtract 1:\n\n7N = 299,999\n\nHmm, now divide both sides by 7 to find N:\n\nN = 299,999 /7 \n\nLet me compute that. Let's see, 299,999 divided by 7. Let me do the division step by step.\n\n7 into 29 is 4 (since 4*7=28). Subtract 28 from 29, remainder 1. Bring down the next 9, making 19. 7 into 19 is 2 (2*7=14), remainder 5. Bring down next 9, making 59. 7 into 59 is 8 (56), remainder 3. Bring down the next 9, making 39. 7 into 39 is 5 (35), remainder 4. Bring down the last 9, making 49. 7 into 49 is exactly 7, no remainder. Wait, but the number was 299,999. Wait, maybe I should write it out properly.\n\nWait, 299,999 divided by 7:\n\nLet me do 299,999 \u00f77:\n\n7 \u00d7 42,857 = ?\n\nWait, 42,857 \u00d77: let's see:\n\n42,857 \u00d77:\n\n40,000 \u00d77 = 280,000\n\n2,857 \u00d77 = 20,  (2,000*7=14,000; 857\u00d77: 800\u00d77=5,600; 57\u00d77=399 \u2192 5,600+399=6,  so 2000+857 is 2857? Wait maybe I should do step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 299,999 divided by 7:\n\nLet me see, 7 \u00d7 42,857 = 299,999?\n\nLet me check:\n\n42,857 \u00d77:\n\n7\u00d740,000 = 280,000.\n\n7\u00d72,000 = 14,000 \u2192 total so far 294,000.\n\n7\u00d7800 = 5,600 \u2192 294k +5.6k = 299,600.\n\n7\u00d750 = 350 \u2192 299,600 + 350 = 299,950.\n\n7\u00d77 = 49 \u2192 total 299,950 +49 = 299,999. Oh yes! So 42,857 \u00d77 = 299,999. So N is 42,857. \n\nSo the number is 42857, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are A)42857, which matches exactly. Let me confirm with the original condition to be sure.\n\nLet me test option A: 42857.\n\nAppending a 1 gives 428571. Prepending a 1 gives 142857. Wait, wait a second. Wait, the original number is 5 digits, so prepending 1 would be 142857 (since 1 followed by 42857). \n\nNow, check if 428571 is three times 142857?\n\nLet me compute 142,857 \u00d73: \n\n142,857 \u00d73: \n\n142,857 \u00d7 3 = 428,571. Exactly! So yes, that's correct. So the answer must be A.\n",
