      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. Hmm, the problem is about sets, maybe using a Venn diagram? Alright, so all 250 files are infected by a virus, a worm, or both. The question is asking how many were not infected by a worm. Oh right, so those would be the ones only infected by a virus, or neither? Wait, no. Because the problem says all are infected by either virus or worm or both. So there's no files that are neither. So the total is all in the union of virus and worm. \n\nLet me parse the details again. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. Let's denote some variables. Let me think: Let V be the set of files with virus, W with worm. Then, the number only worm is W_only = 2.5 * both. The both part is the intersection, right? So W_only = 2.5*(V \u2229 W). \n\nAlso, 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% not infected by a virus would mean that the number not in V is 125. Since total is 250. So the number not in V is the ones only in W (worm only) plus those in neither? Wait, but all files are in at least one. So not in V would be exactly the worm only group. Because the total in V's complement (since universe is all files) is worm only. So that means worm only is 125? Wait, but that might conflict with the first part.\n\nWait, let me write down the equations properly. Let me set variables:\n\nLet both = x (number of files infected by both virus and worm).\n\nThen, worm only is 2.5x. \n\nThe total number of worm-infected files (W) is worm only + both = 2.5x + x = 3.5x.\n\nThe virus-infected files (V) would be virus only plus both. Let's call virus only as y. So V = y + x. \n\nTotal files: virus only + both + worm only = y + x + 2.5x = y + 3.5x = 250. \n\nNow, the problem says 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. The number not infected by a virus is the worm only group, which is 2.5x. Since 50% of 250 is 125, that must equal 2.5x. \n\nAh! So 2.5x = 125. Solving for x: x = 125 / 2.5 = 50. \n\nSo the both is 50. Then, worm only is 2.5 *50 = 125. \n\nNow, to find the number not infected by a worm. Wait, but all files are in virus or worm or both. So not infected by worm would be those only in virus. So virus only is total minus (worm only + both) = 250 - (125 +50) = 250 -175 = 75. So the answer should be 75, which is option C. \n\nWait, let me check again. Let me verify all numbers. \n\nBoth: 50, worm only: 125. So total worm is 175. Virus not infected is 125, which matches the 50% given. \n\nTotal virus would be virus only (75) plus both (50) = 125. So the virus total is 125. So the percentage not in virus is 125, which is 50%, that checks out. \n\nThe question is asking how many were not infected by a worm. Those are the virus only, which is 75. So the answer is C. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A)50, B)70, C)75, D)100, E)125. Yep, C is 75. That seems right. I think that's correct.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem step by step. So the question is about files on Sam's hard drive infected by viruses or worms. Hmm, all 250 files are infected by either a virus, a worm, or both. So there's no file that's clean of both. \n\nThe problem says the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. Let me parse that. Let me denote some variables here. Let me think. \n\nLet me recall set theory terms. Let V be the set of files with a virus, W those with a worm. The total is 250. The question is asking for the number not infected by a worm, which would be the total minus those in W. But I need to find that.\n\nWait, the problem says \"not infected by a worm\" so that's the complement of W. So the answer would be 250 minus the number in W. But to find that, I need to figure out how many are in W. \n\nLet me note down the given information. \n\nFirst, all files are in V or W or both. So the union of V and W is 250. \n\nThe number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number infected by both. \n\nHmm, \"only by a worm\" would be the part of W that's not in V, right? So that's W minus the intersection (both). Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let B be the number of files infected by both virus and worm. Then the number infected only by worm is 2.5*B. \n\nSo the total in W is the only worm plus both, which would be 2.5B + B = 3.5B. \n\nNow, the other part: 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. Wait, 50% not infected by a virus means that the number not in V is 125 (since 250/2 is 125). \n\nThe number not infected by a virus is the same as the number only in W plus those not in either? Wait, but the problem says all are in at least one, so there's no files outside both. Wait the first sentence says all 250 are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. So the total is exactly V \u222a W = 250. So the number not in V would be exactly the number only in W. Because there's no files outside. \n\nSo the number not in V is the number only in W, which is 2.5B. And according to the problem, that's 50% of 250, which is 125. Wait, so 2.5B = 125? \n\nWait, that must be. Let me check again. \n\nThe problem states \"50% of the files were not infected by a virus\" which translates to the number of files not in V. Since all files are in V or W or both, the ones not in V are exactly those only in W. So yes, that's 2.5B. \n\nSo 2.5B = 125. \n\nSolving for B: B = 125 / 2.5. Let me calculate that. 2.5 times 50 is 125, so B would be 50? Wait no, wait 2.5 * 50 is 125. So 125 divided by 2.5 is 50? Wait 2.5 \u00d7 50 = 125, yes. So B is 50. \n\nWait, so the number of files infected by both is 50. Then the number only in W is 2.5\u00d750 = 125. \n\nWait a second, so the total number in W is 125 (only W) + 50 (both) = 175. \n\nTherefore, the number not infected by a worm would be total minus W, which is 250 - 175 = 75. Hmm, but let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. \n\nTotal = V + W - Both. \n\nBut let me see if that works with the numbers. \n\nWait, let me see. \n\nWe know that the number not in V is 125, which is the same as the number only in W. \n\nSo the number in V (either only V or both) is 250 - 125 = 125. \n\nSo V is 125. \n\nBut the number in V is (only V) + both. Let me denote:\n\nOnly V = V_only = ?\n\nBoth = B =50. \n\nSo V_only = V_total - B = 125 -50 =75. \n\nTotal in W is (only W) + B = 125 +50 = 175. \n\nThus, the number not in W is 250 -175 =75. \n\nSo the answer would be C)75. \n\nWait but let me check the options.
