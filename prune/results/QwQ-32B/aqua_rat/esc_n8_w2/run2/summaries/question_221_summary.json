      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this ratio problem here. Let me see. The question says two numbers are in the ratio 3:5. Then when you subtract 9 from each, their new ratio becomes 12:23. I need to find the smaller number. The options are given, so maybe I can set up equations and solve it.\n\nFirst, ratios. Let me denote the two numbers. Since they are in the ratio 3:5, I can call them 3x and 5x. That way, the ratio is maintained because 3x/5x is 3/5. The actual numbers would be multiples of these, right?\n\nSo the original numbers are 3x and 5x. The smaller one is 3x, obviously. The problem says when 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio is 12:23. So after subtracting 9, the numbers become (3x -9) and (5x -9). The ratio of these two should be 12/23.\n\nSo I can set up the equation: (3x - 9)/(5x -9) = 12/23.\n\nNow, cross-multiplying to solve for x. Let's do that step by step.\n\nMultiply both sides by 23*(5x-9) to eliminate denominators. So:\n\n23*(3x -9) = 12*(5x -9)\n\nLet me compute each side. Left side: 23*3x is 69x, and 23*(-9) is -207. So left side is 69x -207.\n\nRight side: 12*5x is 60x, and 12*(-9) is -108. So right side is 60x -108.\n\nNow bring all terms to one side. Let's subtract right side from both sides:\n\n69x -207 - (60x -108) =0\n\nWhich simplifies to 69x -207 -60x +108 =0\n\nCombine like terms: (69x-60x) + (-207 +108) = 0 \u2192 9x -99 =0\n\nSo 9x =99 \u2192 x=11.\n\nHmm, so x is 11. Then the original numbers are 3x=33 and 5x=55. Wait, but the options have 21, 33, 35, etc. The smaller number is 33? But option B is 33. Let me check the options again. The options are A)21, B)33, C)35, D)42, E)58. So B is an option. But wait, let me verify the calculation again because sometimes I might make a mistake in cross-multiplying.\n\nLet me recheck the equation setup. Original ratio 3:5, so numbers 3x and5x. Subtract 9 each, so (3x-9)/(5x-9) =12/23. Cross multiply gives 23(3x-9)=12(5x-9). \n\nYes, that's correct. Let me compute again:\n\nLeft side: 23*3x = 69x, 23*(-9) = -207 \u2192 69x-207.\n\nRight side: 12*5x=60x, 12*(-9)= -108 \u2192 60x-108.\n\nSo equation: 69x -207 =60x-108.\n\nSubtract 60x both sides: 9x -207 = -108.\n\nAdd 207 to both sides: 9x = 99 \u2192 x=11. So that's correct.\n\nSo the numbers are 3*11=33 and 5*11=55. The smaller one is 33, which is option B. But wait, let me check if subtracting 9 gives the right ratio. Let's see:\n\n33-9=24, 55-9=46. So 24:46. Let's simplify that. Divide numerator and denominator by 2: 12/23. Exactly the ratio given. So that works. So the answer is B)33. \n\nWait, but the options have A as 21. Did I do something wrong here? Let me see another way. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up variables. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the numbers after subtraction, but maybe I need to check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio after subtraction is 12:23, so 24:46 is equivalent, which is 12:23 when divided by 2. So that's correct. So the answer must be B. Hmm. But let me check the options again. The problem says \"the smaller number is?\" which is 33, so B. That's one of the options. So I think that's right. Wait, but why is the option A 21? Let me see if I miscalculated x. Let me try again.\n\nWait, when I cross-multiplied, 23*(3x-9)=12*(5x-9). Let me plug x=11 into left side: 23*(33-9)=23*24=552. Right side: 12*(55-9)=12*46=552. Oh yes, that's correct. So both sides equal. So the answer is indeed 33. So B is correct. \n\nHmm. I think that's right. So the answer should be B)33.\n",

Did I set up the equations correctly? The ratio after subtracting 9 is (3x-9)/(5x-9) = 12/23. Yes. Cross-multiplied correctly.

So the answer is 33, which is B. \n\nWait, but looking at the options again, option A is 21. Maybe I made a mistake in the ratio setup? Like maybe I flipped the ratio? Let me check the problem again. The original ratio is 3:5. After subtracting 9, the new ratio is 12:23. So the first number after subtraction over the second is 12/23. Since the original numbers were 3:5, so after subtraction, the first number (3x-9) corresponds to 12 parts, and the second (5x-9) to 23 parts. So the setup was correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where after subtraction, the order changes? But 3x is smaller than 5x, subtracting 9 from each would keep the order, so the first number is still smaller. So the ratio 12:23 is in the same order. So yes, the setup is correct. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is B)33. Let me check if any of the other options could work. Let's try option A, 21. If the smaller number is 21, then the original numbers would be 21 and (since ratio 3:5, so 21 is 3 parts, so each part is 7, so 5 parts would be 35). Then subtract 9: 21-9=12 and 35-9=26. 12:26 simplifies to 6:13, which is not 12:23. So that's not correct. \n\nOption C is 35. If the smaller number is 35, then the larger would be (35*(5/3)), which is about 58.33. Not an integer. Wait, but maybe the numbers have to be integers. Let's see, 35 would be 3 parts? Wait, no. If 35 is the smaller, then the ratio 3:5 would have 35=3x, so x is 35/3 \u2248 11.666. Then 5x would be 5*(35/3)=175/3 \u224858.333. Subtract 9 from each: 35-9=26, 58.333-9\u224849.333. The ratio would be 26:49.333, which is roughly 26/(148/3) \u2192 not sure, but 26*3=78, 148? Wait 49.333 is 148/3? Not sure. Anyway, 26/ (148/3) is 78/148 = 39/74, which is not 12/23. So that's not right. \n\nOption D is 42. If smaller is 42, then 3x=42 \u2192 x=14. The larger is 5x=70. Subtract 9 gives 33 and 61. 33/61 is not 12/23. 12/23 is approximately 0.521, while 33/61 is ~0.54. Not equal. \n\nOption E is 58. That would be way larger. So no. \n\nSo B is correct.

The answer must be B)33.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the two numbers be \\(3x\\) and \\(5x\\) based on their ratio 3:5. When 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers become \\(3x - 9\\) and \\(5x - 9\\), which are in the ratio 12:23. Setting up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3x - 9}{5x - 9} = \\frac{12}{23}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\n\\[\n23(3x - 9) = 12(5x - 9)\n\\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\n\\[\n69x - 207 = 60x - 108\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\n9x = 99 \\implies x = 11\n\\]\n\nThe original numbers are \\(3x = 33\\) and \\(5x = 55\\). The smaller number is \\(33\\). Verifying, subtracting 9 gives \\(24\\) and \\(46\\), which simplifies to the ratio \\(12:23\\), confirming the solution.\n\nAnswer: B)33.\n\nAnswer: B",
