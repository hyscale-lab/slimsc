      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the rate of interest where the difference between compound interest and simple interest for 2 years on Rs.5000 is Rs.72. Hmm, let's think. \n\nFirst, I remember that the formula for simple interest (SI) is principal * rate * time divided by 100. For two years, that would be SI = (P*R*2)/100. \n\nCompound interest (CI), on the other hand, is calculated on the principal and the accumulated interest each year. Since it's compounded annually for two years, the amount after the first year is P(1 + R/100), and then the second year's interest is on that amount. So the total CI would be the amount after two years minus the principal. \n\nThe difference between CI and SI is given as 72. Let me write down the formulas properly.\n\nLet me denote the principal as P = 5000, time T = 2 years, rate R.\n\nSimple Interest for 2 years: SI = (P*R*2)/100 = (5000*R*2)/100 = 100R*2 = 100R*2? Wait, wait. Let me calculate again. 5000 * R * 2 divided by 100. So that's (5000*2R)/100 = (10000R)/100 = 100R. So SI is 100R.\n\nCompound Interest for 2 years: The formula is P[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1]. Let's compute that. So CI = 5000[(1 + R/100)^2 - 1]. Let me expand that term inside the brackets. (1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. Subtracting 1 gives 2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100^2). So CI = 5000*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/(10000)). \n\nBreaking that down: 5000*(2R/100) is the same as 5000*(R/50) which is 100R. Then the second term is 5000*(R\u00b2)/10000, which simplifies to (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2. \n\nSo CI is 100R + 0.5 R\u00b2. \n\nThe difference between CI and SI is given as 72. So CI - SI = 72. \n\nSubstituting the expressions: (100R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - (100R) = 0.5 R\u00b2 = 72. \n\nAh, so 0.5 R squared equals 72. Multiply both sides by 2: R\u00b2 = 144. Taking the square root gives R = 12. So the rate is 12%, which is option B. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did that correctly. Let me re-calculate the difference step again. \n\nYes, because CI is principal*(1 + r)^2 - principal, which is principal*( (1+ r)^2 -1 ). The SI is principal*r*T. So for two years, the difference between CI and SI is principal*( ( (1 + r)^2 -1 ) - 2r ). Let me compute that expression inside the parentheses:\n\n(1 + 2r + r\u00b2 -1 ) - 2r = 2r + r\u00b2 -2r = r\u00b2. So the difference is principal * (r\u00b2)/(100^2). Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I should represent R as a decimal. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula for the difference between CI and SI for two years is (P * R\u00b2)/(100\u00b2). Because when you compute CI - SI, the terms with R cancel except the R squared term. Let me see.\n\nLet me compute CI - SI again step by step. \n\nCI is P*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 ) = P*( (1 + 2R/100 + (R/100)^2 ) -1 ) = P*(2R/100 + (R^2)/(100^2)).\n\nSI is P*R*T/100 = P*(2R)/100. \n\nSubtracting SI from CI: \n\nCI - SI = P*(2R/100 + R\u00b2/10000 - 2R/100) = P*( R\u00b2 / 10000 ). \n\nWait, that gives P*(R\u00b2)/10000 = difference. \n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I had 0.5 R\u00b2. Wait, which is correct? There's a discrepancy here. Let me check again.\n\nAh! Oh, I see I made an error in my first calculation. Let me redo that. \n\nWait, let's do it again carefully. \n\nCI is 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 -1 )\n\nExpanding (1 + x)^2 -1 where x = R/100 gives 2x + x\u00b2. So:\n\nCI = 5000*( 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 )\n\nSo that's 5000*( 2R/100 + R\u00b2/10000 )\n\nBreaking that down:\n\nFirst term: 5000*(2R)/100 = (5000/100)*2R = 50*2R = 100R.\n\nSecond term: 5000*(R\u00b2)/10000 = (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2. \n\nSo CI = 100R + 0.5 R\u00b2. \n\nThe SI is 100R, so CI - SI = 0.5 R\u00b2. \n\nSo 0.5 R\u00b2 = 72 \u2192 R\u00b2 = 144 \u2192 R = 12. \n\nAh, so my first calculation was correct. The second approach I thought of was wrong because perhaps I made a miscalculation. \n\nWait, the formula for difference between CI and SI for two years is indeed (P * R\u00b2)/(100\u00b2). Wait, but according to this, that would be 5000*(R^2)/10000 = (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2, which matches the first calculation. So that's correct. \n\nSo 0.5 R squared = 72 \u2192 R squared = 144 \u2192 R = 12%. \n\nSo the answer should be B)12%.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about the difference between simple interest and compound interest for a certain principal amount over two years. The question says the difference is Rs.72, and I need to find the rate of interest. The options are given as percentages from 4% up to 12%. Let me think step by step how to approach this.\n\nHmm, I remember that the formula for simple interest (SI) is straightforward: SI = P * R * T / 100. Since it's for two years, T would be 2 here. So for the given principal of 5000, the simple interest over two years would be (5000 * R * 2)/100. That simplifies to (100 * R), right? Because 5000 divided by 100 is 50, multiplied by 2 gives 100. So SI = 100R.\n\nNow, compound interest (CI) for two years is calculated differently. Since it's compounded annually, the formula for CI after two years would be P*(1 + R/100)^2 - P. Let me write that out. The amount after two years is 5000*(1 + R/100)^2, so subtracting the principal gives the CI. \n\nThe difference between CI and SI is given as 72. So, CI - SI = 72. Let me set up that equation.\n\nFirst, let me compute CI - SI:\n\nCI = 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 )\nSI = (5000*R*2)/100 = 100R\n\nSo CI - SI = 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ) - 100R = 72.\n\nHmm, maybe expanding the CI term would help. Let's expand (1 + R/100)^2:\n\n(1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. \n\nSo subtracting 1 gives 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. \n\nTherefore, CI is 5000*( 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ). \n\nSo CI minus SI would be:\n\n5000*(2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100^2)) - 100R \n\nWait, but the SI is 100R, so let's substitute that in:\n\nCI - SI = [5000*(2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100^2))] - 100R \n\nLet me compute each term step by step. \n\nFirst, 5000*(2*(R/100)) = 5000*(2R/100) = (5000*2R)/100 = 100R. \n\nThen the second part is 5000*(R\u00b2)/(100\u00b2) = (5000*R\u00b2)/(10000) = (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCI = 100R + 0.5 R\u00b2 \n\nThen, CI - SI = (100R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - 100R = 0.5 R\u00b2 \n\nWait, that's a much simpler way! Oh right, because the CI formula when subtracted from itself minus SI gives only the extra part from the compounding. So the difference between CI and SI for two years is actually P*(R/100)^2. Wait, but let me check that again because in my calculation here, I got 0.5 R squared. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. Let me do it step by step again.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula that the difference between CI and SI for two years is (SI * R)/100. Or maybe another way. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the difference between CI and SI for two years is equal to the interest on the first year's interest. Because in CI, the interest is compounded, so the second year's interest includes interest on the first year's interest, whereas SI does not. So the difference is that extra interest on the first year's interest. \n\nThe first year's interest is (P*R)/100. The interest on that would be ( (P*R)/100 ) * R /100. So the difference is P*(R/100)^2. \n\nAh, so the difference is P*(R/100)^2. \n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I had 0.5 R squared. Let me see where that came from. Wait, in my calculation above:\n\nThe CI was 5000*(2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2). So 5000*(2*(R/100) is 5000*(2R/100) = 100R, and the second term is (R^2)/10000 * 5000, which is (5000 R\u00b2)/10000 = (R\u00b2)/2. So yes, that term is 0.5 R squared. So when subtracting SI (100R), the difference is 0.5 R squared. But according to the other approach, it should be P*(R/100)^2. Let me see.\n\nWait P is 5000, so P*(R/100)^2 = 5000*(R\u00b2)/(100)^2 = 5000 R\u00b2 / 10000 = (5000/10000) R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2. Oh! So that's the same as my previous calculation. So yes, the difference is indeed 0.5 R squared. So the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the difference CI - SI = (P * R\u00b2) / (100)^2. Wait, but according to the previous, that's exactly what it is. So the formula is:\n\nDifference = (P * R\u00b2) / (100)^2. \n\nSo in this case, the difference is 72, so:\n\n(5000 * R\u00b2) / (100)^2 = 72 \n\nLet me compute that equation. Let's plug the numbers in.\n\n5000 R\u00b2 / (10000) = 72 \n\nSimplify 5000/10000 is 0.5. So 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \n\nThen R\u00b2 = 72 * 2 = 144 \n\nTherefore R = sqrt(144) = 12. \n\nSo the rate is 12%. Which is option B. \n\nWait, but let me check again to be sure. Let me verify with the options given. The options are A)10%, B)12%, C)6%, D)8%, E)4%. So 12% is B. \n\nLet me confirm with another approach. Let me compute both SI and CI for 12% and check the difference. \n\nPrincipal is 5000, rate 12% for 2 years.\n\nSimple Interest: (5000 *12 *2)/100 = (5000*24)/100 = 1200. \n\nCompound Interest: \n\nFirst year: 5000 *12/100 = 600. Amount after first year: 5600. \n\nSecond year: 5600 *12/100 = 672. Total CI = 600 +672 =1272. \n\nDifference between CI and SI is 1272 -1200 =72. Which matches the given difference. \n\nSo the answer is B)12%. \n\nHmm, so that seems correct. Let me check another option just to be safe. Suppose someone thought the formula was different. For example, if someone used the formula CI - SI = PR^2/(100^2) which is exactly what we did. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could miscalculate. But I think the steps are correct.

Let me write that out. The amount after two years is 5000*(1 + R/100)^2, so subtracting the principal gives the CI. \n\nThe difference between CI and SI is given as 72. So, CI - SI = 72. Let me set up that equation.\n\nFirst, let me compute CI - SI:\n\nCI = 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 )\nSI = (5000*R*2)/100 = 100R\n\nSo CI - SI = 5000*( (1 + R/100)^2 - 1 ) - 100R = 72.\n\nHmm, maybe expanding the CI term would help. Let's expand (1 + R/100)^2:\n\n(1 + R/100)^2 = 1 + 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. \n\nSo subtracting 1 gives 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2. \n\nTherefore, CI is 5000*( 2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2 ). \n\nSo CI minus SI would be:\n\n5000*(2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100^2)) - 100R \n\nWait, but the SI is 100R, so let's substitute that in:\n\nCI - SI = [5000*(2*(R/100) + (R^2)/(100^2))] - 100R \n\nLet me compute each term step by step. \n\nFirst, 5000*(2*(R/100)) = 5000*(2R/100) = (5000*2R)/100 = 100R. \n\nThen the second part is 5000*(R\u00b2)/(100\u00b2) = (5000*R\u00b2)/(10000) = (5000/10000)*R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nCI = 100R + 0.5 R\u00b2 \n\nThen, CI - SI = (100R + 0.5 R\u00b2) - 100R = 0.5 R\u00b2 \n\nWait, that's a much simpler way! Oh right, because the CI formula when subtracted from itself minus SI gives only the extra part from the compounding. So the difference between CI and SI for two years is actually P*(R/100)^2. Wait, but let me check that again because in my calculation here, I got 0.5 R squared. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me recalculate. Let me do it step by step again.\n\nAlternatively, there's a formula that the difference between CI and SI for two years is (SI * R)/100. Or maybe another way. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the difference between CI and SI for two years is equal to the interest on the first year's interest. Because in CI, the interest is compounded, so the second year's interest includes interest on the first year's interest, whereas SI does not. So the difference is that extra interest on the first year's interest. \n\nThe first year's interest is (P*R)/100. The interest on that would be ( (P*R)/100 ) * R /100. So the difference is P*(R/100)^2. \n\nAh, so the difference is P*(R/100)^2. \n\nWait, but in my previous calculation, I had 0.5 R squared. Let me see where that came from. Wait, in my calculation above:\n\nThe CI was 5000*(2*(R/100) + (R/100)^2). So 5000*(2*(R/100) is 5000*(2R/100) = 100R, and the second term is (R^2)/10000 * 5000, which is (5000 R\u00b2)/10000 = (R\u00b2)/2. So yes, that term is 0.5 R squared. So when subtracting SI (100R), the difference is 0.5 R squared. But according to the other approach, it should be P*(R/100)^2. Let me see.\n\nWait P is 5000, so P*(R/100)^2 = 5000*(R\u00b2)/(100)^2 = 5000 R\u00b2 / 10000 = (5000/10000) R\u00b2 = 0.5 R\u00b2. Oh! So that's the same as my previous calculation. So yes, the difference is indeed 0.5 R squared. So the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the difference CI - SI = (P * R\u00b2) / (100)^2. Wait, but according to the previous, that's exactly what it is. So the formula is:\n\nDifference = (P * R\u00b2) / (100)^2. \n\nSo in this case, the difference is 72, so:\n\n(5000 * R\u00b2) / (100)^2 = 72 \n\nLet me compute that equation. Let's plug the numbers in.\n\n5000 R\u00b2 / (10000) = 72 \n\nSimplify 5000/10000 is 0.5. So 0.5 R\u00b2 =72 \n\nThen R\u00b2 = 72 * 2 = 144 \n\nTherefore R = sqrt(144) = 12. \n\nSo the rate is 12%. Which is option B. \n\nWait, but let me check again to be sure. Let me verify with the options given. The options are A)10%, B)12%, C)6%, D)8%, E)4%. So 12% is B. \n\nLet me confirm with another approach. Let me compute both SI and CI for 12% and check the difference. \n\nPrincipal is 5000, rate 12% for 2 years.\n\nSimple Interest: (5000 *12 *2)/100 = (5000*24)/100 = 1200. \n\nCompound Interest: \n\nFirst year: 5000 *12/100 = 600. Amount after first year: 5600. \n\nSecond year: 5600 *12/100 = 672. Total CI = 600 +672 =1272. \n\nDifference between CI and SI is 1272 -1200 =72. Which matches the given difference. \n\nSo the answer is B)12%. \n\nHmm, so that seems correct. Let me check another option just to be safe. Suppose someone thought the formula was different. For example, if someone used the formula CI - SI = PR^2/(100^2) which is exactly what we did. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could miscalculate. But I think the steps are correct. So the correct answer is B.\n\n\nThe difference between compound interest (CI) and simple interest (SI) for two years can be calculated using the formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = \\frac{P \\times R^2}{100^2}\n\\]  \nGiven \\( P = 5000 \\), the difference is \\( 72 \\):  \n\\[\n\\frac{5000 \\times R^2}{100^2} = 72  \n\\]  \nSimplifying:  \n\\[\n\\frac{5000}{10000} \\times R^2 = 72 \\implies 0.5 \\times R^2 = 72 \\implies R^2 = 144 \\implies R = 12\\%  \n\\]  \nVerification with \\( R = 12\\% \\):  \n- **SI**: \\( \\frac{5000 \\times 12 \\times 2}{100} = 1200 \\)  \n- **CI**: First year interest \\( 600 \\), second year interest \\( 672 \\), total CI \\( 1272 \\).  \n- **Difference**: \\( 1272 - 1200 = 72 \\), which matches the given value.  \n\nThus, the rate of interest is **12%**.  \n\nAnswer: B",
