      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the value of log base 2 of 4. Hmm, log2(4). Let me think. Remember that logarithms are the inverse of exponentiation. So log base 2 of 4 means, \"2 raised to what power gives me 4?\" Right?\n\nLet me break it down. The general form is log_b(a) = c means that b^c = a. So here, b is 2, a is 4, so we need to find c where 2^c =4. \n\nWhat's 2 squared? 2^2 is 4. Oh, right! So that means c is 2. So the answer should be 2, which is option A. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Sometimes I confuse log base 10 or natural log, but here it's definitely base 2. Let me check again. 2^1 is 2, 2^2 is 4. Yep, exactly. So the logarithm here is 2. The options are A)2, so that's the one. The other options are way bigger. Like B is 4, but 2^4 would be 16, which is not 4. So definitely A is correct.\n",

The general form is log\u2082(4) = x, which translates to 2^x = 4. I need to find x here. What power do I need to raise 2 to in order to get 4? Well, 2 squared is 4 because 2*2=4. So x should be 2.

If I think about logarithms, log base 2 of 8 would be 3 because 2^3=8. So for 4, which is 2 squared, the log base 2 should indeed be 2. Yeah, that makes sense. So the correct answer must be A.
