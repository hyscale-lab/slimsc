      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here where a man borrows 360 rupees and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of 31.50 each. I need to find the interest rate. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with installment payments, the interest is probably calculated using some kind of simple or compound interest formula. Wait, but since the payments are monthly, maybe it's a simple interest problem? Or could it be using the concept of reducing balance? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me see.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total amount he's paying back. If each installment is 31.50 and there are 12 of them, that's 31.50 multiplied by 12. Let me do that math. 31.50 times 12... Well, 30 times 12 is 360, and 1.5 times 12 is 18, so total would be 360 +18 = 378. So he's paying back a total of 378 rupees. \n\nThe principal is 360, so the total interest paid is 378 - 360 = 18 rupees over the year. Wait a second, if that's the case, maybe this is a simple interest problem where the interest is 18 per year on 360. Let me check that. Simple interest formula is I = P * R * T. Here, T is 1 year since it's 12 months. So 18 = 360 * R * 1. Solving for R would be 18/360 = 0.05, so 5%? That would be option D. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Is that the right approach here? Because in installment payments, sometimes the interest is calculated on the reducing balance. In that case, the calculation would be different. Let me think again. \n\nIf it's a reducing balance, each month the principal decreases as he pays each installment. The monthly payment would be calculated based on the remaining principal. But in that case, the total interest would be less than the simple interest approach. Hmm, but the question doesn't specify which method to use. Maybe the question assumes simple interest? Because if it's simple, then the answer is 5%, which is an option here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's using the concept of simple interest for the entire year. Let me confirm. The question says \"what is his interest rate?\" without specifying. Maybe in such cases, the default is simple interest. Let me recalculate with that assumption. \n\nTotal interest is 18. Principal is 360. Time is 1 year. So rate is (18/360)*100 = 5%. So that's D. \n\nAlternatively, if the problem is expecting the simple interest per month, but that seems unlikely. Wait, the options include 1.5%, which could be a monthly rate. But the question says \"interest rate\" without specifying, so probably annual. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting the answer using the simple interest method. Let me check another approach. Let's see, the total amount paid is 378. The extra is 18. So 18 over 360 is 5%. So that's the rate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's calculated as monthly rate? Let me see. If the monthly rate is r, then each installment is part principal and part interest. Let me think in terms of the reducing balance. For example, the first month's interest would be 360*r. The first payment of 31.50 would cover that interest plus some principal. \n\nBut calculating that way would be more complicated, and since the answer is an option here, maybe the question is expecting the simple interest approach. Because otherwise, the calculation would require solving an equation for each month. Let me try that approach to see if it gives a different answer. \n\nLet me try the reducing balance method. Let's suppose the monthly interest rate is r. The loan is 360, and each month he pays 31.50. Let me model the loan balance each month. \n\nLet me denote the balance after each month. \n\nAfter first month: \n\nInterest = 360 * r \n\nPayment is 31.50, so principal paid is 31.50 - (360*r). \n\nSo new balance: 360 - (31.50 - 360r) = 360 - 31.50 + 360r \n\nWait, no, actually, the balance after first month would be previous balance plus interest minus payment. \n\nSo: \n\nBalance after month 1: 360*(1 + r) - 31.50 \n\nSimilarly, balance after month 2: [360*(1+r) -31.50]*(1 + r) -31.50 \n\nAnd so on, until after 12 months, the balance is zero. \n\nThis forms a geometric series equation. \n\nThe formula for the present value of an annuity can be used here. \n\nThe formula for the present value (PV) of an ordinary annuity is: \n\nPV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ] \n\nWhere PMT is the monthly payment, n is the number of periods, and r is the monthly interest rate. \n\nSo here, PV is 360, PMT is 31.50, n is 12. We need to find r. \n\nSo 360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ] \n\nHmm, solving this equation for r would give the monthly rate. Then we can multiply by 12 to get the annual rate. \n\nBut this equation is not straightforward to solve algebraically. Maybe we can try plugging in the options to see which one fits. \n\nThe options are given in annual rates. Let me see the options again: \n\nA)1.5% (maybe monthly? Unlikely, as annual rate would be 18% if so, which is not an option here. Wait, no, the options are annual rates. So the options D is 5% annual. So if the question is asking for annual rate, we can check each option's monthly rate. \n\nLet me try option D: 5% annual rate. So the monthly rate would be 5%/12 \u2248 0.4167% per month. Let me plug that into the formula. \n\nLet me compute the right-hand side with r = 0.0041666667 (5% annual, so 0.05/12 = 0.0041666667). \n\nFirst, compute (1 + r)^-12. Let me calculate that. \n\n(1 + 0.0041666667)^12 \u2248 e^(12 * ln(1.0041666667)) \n\nBut maybe approximate step by step. Alternatively, since 1.0041666667^12 is approximately (1 + 0.05/12)^12 \u2248 1.05116. Wait, actually, (1 + 0.05/12)^12 is the effective annual rate. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute numerically. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute (1 - (1 + r)^-12)/r \n\nLet me compute 1 + r = 1.0041666667 \n\n(1.0041666667)^12: Let's compute step by step. \n\nFirst, 1.0041666667^12. \n\nLet me compute 1.0041666667 squared: \n\n1.0041666667 * 1.0041666667 \u2248 1.0083555556 \n\nThen to the 4th power: (1.0083555556)^2 \u2248 1.01678 \n\nThen to the 8th power: (1.01678)^2 \u2248 1.0338 \n\nBut this might not be precise. Alternatively, perhaps I should use logarithms or another approach. Alternatively, use the formula for the present value factor. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to compute the value for each possible answer's monthly rate. Let me see which options could be possible. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting simple interest, so the answer is 5%. Let's see the options again. The options are A)1.5, B)4.5, C)10, D)5, E)12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering simple interest per month. So total interest is 18. The principal is 360, time is 1 year, so rate is 5% per annum. That seems straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, if the question is using simple interest, then that's the answer. But the problem with that approach is that in installments, the principal isn't there for the entire year. So maybe the simple interest approach isn't correct here. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose it's simple interest. Then total interest is PRT = 360 * R *1. So R = 18/360 = 0.05, so 5%. \n\nBut in reality, when you pay in installments, each payment reduces the principal, so the interest is actually less than simple interest. Wait, but in this case, the total interest came out to 18, which would be the same as simple interest. So maybe the question assumes that the interest is calculated as simple interest, not on a reducing balance. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using the concept of simple interest for each installment. Wait, maybe the problem is structured so that each installment includes a portion of the principal plus interest for that period. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the total interest is 18, so the rate is 5% per annum. Since that's one of the options, maybe that's the answer. \n\nAlternatively, let's try using the annuity formula. Let's see if with 5% annual rate, the present value comes to 360. \n\nLet me try with an annual rate of 5%, so monthly rate is 5%/12 = 0.416666...%. Let me compute the present value factor. \n\nThe formula is PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]\n\nPlugging in PMT=31.50, n=12, r=0.00416666667. \n\nFirst compute (1 + r)^-12. Let me compute 1.00416666667^12 first. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps approximate using the formula for small r. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a calculator approach. Let me see. \n\nLet me compute 1/(1.00416666667)^12. \n\nAlternatively, let's compute step by step:\n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.00416666667)^12.\n\nFirst, let me note that (1 + 0.05/12)^12 \u2248 e^(0.05) \u2248 1.05127, but that's the effective annual rate. However, we need to compute (1 + r)^12 where r is 0.05/12. \n\nWait, (1 + 0.00416666667)^12 = (1 + 0.05/12)^12 \u2248 1.05116. \n\nSo (1 + r)^12 \u2248 1.05116, so (1 + r)^-12 \u2248 1/1.05116 \u2248 0.9514. \n\nSo 1 - 0.9514 = 0.0486. \n\nThen (0.0486) divided by r (0.0041666667) equals 0.0486 / 0.0041666667 \u2248 11.664. \n\nSo the present value factor is approximately 11.664. \n\nMultiply that by PMT of 31.50 gives 31.50 * 11.664 \u2248 ?\n\n31.5 * 10 is 315, 31.5 *1.664 is approx 31.5*1.6=50.4, 31.5*0.064\u22482.016. So total 50.4+2.016=52.416. Total PV would be 315 +52.416 \u2248 367.416. \n\nHmm, that's higher than 360. So if the monthly rate is 5%/12, then PV is about 367, but the loan is 360, so that suggests that the actual rate is higher than 5%? \n\nHmm, so that approach gives a higher PV than needed. \n\nWait, so maybe the actual rate is lower? Let me try a lower rate. \n\nSuppose the annual rate is 4.5%, so monthly is 0.375%. Let me try that. \n\nr = 0.00375. \n\nCompute (1 + 0.00375)^12. \n\nLet me compute step by step. \n\nFirst, 0.00375 is 3/8 of 1%, so 0.375%. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute ln(1.00375) = approx 0.00374. Multiply by 12 gives 0.0449. \n\nExponentiating gives e^0.0449 \u2248 1.046. So (1.00375)^12 \u2248 1.046. \n\nThus, (1 + r)^-12 \u2248 1/1.046 \u2248 0.956. \n\n1 - 0.956 = 0.044. \n\nDivide by r (0.00375): 0.044 /0.00375 \u2248 11.733. \n\nMultiply by 31.50: 31.5 *11.733 \u2248 31.5*10=315, 31.5*1.733\u224854.53. Total 315+54.53=369.53. Still higher than 360. \n\nHmm, so maybe the rate needs to be higher. Let's try 5.5% annually? Let's see. \n\nWait, but 5% already gave a PV of around 367, so to get to 360, we need a higher rate? \n\nWait, when the interest rate increases, the present value decreases. Because higher discount rate reduces the present value. \n\nSo if at 5%, PV is 367, which is higher than 360, we need a higher rate to get PV down to 360. Let's try 6% annual, so monthly rate 0.5%. \n\nr=0.005. \n\n(1.005)^12 \u2248 1.061678. \n\nThus, (1 + r)^-12 \u2248 1/1.061678 \u22480.9418. \n\n1-0.9418=0.0582. \n\nDivide by 0.005 gives 0.0582/0.005 =11.64. \n\nMultiply by 31.5 gives 31.5*11.64 = 31.5*10=315, 31.5*1.64\u224851.66. Total 315+51.66=366.66. Still higher than 360. \n\nHmm, maybe 7%? Let's try that. \n\nr=0.07/12\u22480.0058333. \n\n(1.0058333)^12. Let me compute ln(1.0058333)= approx 0.00581. Multiply by 12: 0.07. e^0.07\u22481.0725. So (1.0058333)^12\u22481.0725. \n\nThus, 1/(1.0725)\u22480.9324. \n\n1-0.9324=0.0676. \n\nDivide by 0.0058333: 0.0676/0.0058333\u224811.59. \n\n31.5 *11.59\u2248 31.5*10=315, 31.5*1.59\u224849.935. Total 364.935. Still higher. \n\nHmm, getting closer but still not 360. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the question expects the simple interest approach. Since using the annuity formula gives that the rate has to be higher than 5% to get PV down to 360, but none of the options except maybe 5% is close. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total interest divided by principal, so 18/360 = 5% per annum. Since that is an option, and perhaps the question is not considering the reducing balance method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the simple interest for each month. For example, each payment includes interest for one month. \n\nWait, let me think differently. The total amount paid is 378. The principal is 360. So total interest is 18. \n\nIf it's simple interest for the entire year, then 18/360 =5%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the answer as 5%, so D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a simple interest problem where the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period. \n\nYes, that's possible. Since in some cases, installment loans might have simple interest. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using the simple interest formula where the total interest is equal to the total payments minus principal, so that would be 5%. \n\nGiven that 5% is an option, and the other approaches are more complicated and don't fit exactly, I think the intended answer is D)5%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe total amount paid back is 12 * 31.50 = 378 rupees. The principal is 360 rupees, so the interest paid is 378 - 360 = 18 rupees. Using the simple interest formula \\( I = P \\times R \\times T \\), where \\( I = 18 \\), \\( P = 360 \\), and \\( T = 1 \\) year, solving for \\( R \\) gives \\( R = \\frac{18}{360} = 0.05 \\) or 5%.

Let me compute 1.00416666667^12 first. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps approximate using the formula for small r. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps use a calculator approach. Let me see. \n\nLet me compute 1/(1.00416666667)^12. \n\nAlternatively, let's compute step by step:\n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.00416666667)^12.\n\nFirst, let me note that (1 + 0.05/12)^12 \u2248 e^(0.05) \u2248 1.05127, but that's the effective annual rate. However, we need to compute (1 + r)^12 where r is 0.05/12. \n\nWait, (1 + 0.00416666667)^12 = (1 + 0.05/12)^12 \u2248 1.05116. \n\nSo (1 + r)^12 \u2248 1.05116, so (1 + r)^-12 \u2248 1/1.05116 \u2248 0.9514. \n\nSo 1 - 0.9514 = 0.0486. \n\nThen (0.0486) divided by r (0.0041666667) equals 0.0486 / 0.0041666667 \u2248 11.664. \n\nSo the present value factor is approximately 11.664. \n\nMultiply that by PMT of 31.50 gives 31.50 * 11.664 \u2248 ?\n\n31.5 * 10 is 315, 31.5 *1.664 is approx 31.5*1.6=50.4, 31.5*0.064\u22482.016. So total 50.4+2.016=52.416. Total PV would be 315 +52.416 \u2248 367.416. \n\nHmm, that's higher than 360. So if the monthly rate is 5%/12, then PV is about 367, but the loan is 360, so that suggests that the actual rate is higher than 5%? \n\nHmm, so that approach gives a higher PV than needed. \n\nWait, so maybe the actual rate is lower? Let me try a lower rate. \n\nSuppose the annual rate is 4.5%, so monthly is 0.375%. Let me try that. \n\nr = 0.00375. \n\nCompute (1 + 0.00375)^12. \n\nLet me compute step by step. \n\nFirst, 0.00375 is 3/8 of 1%, so 0.375%. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute ln(1.00375) = approx 0.00374. Multiply by 12 gives 0.0449. \n\nExponentiating gives e^0.0449 \u2248 1.046. So (1.00375)^12 \u2248 1.046. \n\nThus, (1 + r)^-12 \u2248 1/1.046 \u2248 0.956. \n\n1 - 0.956 = 0.044. \n\nDivide by r (0.00375): 0.044 /0.00375 \u2248 11.733. \n\nMultiply by 31.50: 31.5 *11.733 \u2248 31.5*10=315, 31.5*1.733\u224854.53. Total 315+54.53=369.53. Still higher than 360. \n\nHmm, so maybe the rate needs to be higher. Let's try 5.5% annually? Let's see. \n\nWait, but 5% already gave a PV of around 367, so to get to 360, we need a higher rate? \n\nWait, when the interest rate increases, the present value decreases. Because higher discount rate reduces the present value. \n\nSo if at 5%, PV is 367, which is higher than 360, we need a higher rate to get PV down to 360. Let's try 6% annual, so monthly rate 0.5%. \n\nr=0.005. \n\n(1.005)^12 \u2248 1.061678. \n\nThus, (1 + r)^-12 \u2248 1/1.061678 \u22480.9418. \n\n1-0.9418=0.0582. \n\nDivide by 0.005 gives 0.0582/0.005 =11.64. \n\nMultiply by 31.5 gives 31.5*11.64 = 31.5*10=315, 31.5*1.64\u224851.66. Total 315+51.66=366.66. Still higher than 360. \n\nHmm, maybe 7%? Let's try that. \n\nr=0.07/12\u22480.0058333. \n\n(1.0058333)^12. Let me compute ln(1.0058333)= approx 0.00581. Multiply by 12: 0.07. e^0.07\u22481.0725. So (1.0058333)^12\u22481.0725. \n\nThus, 1/(1.0725)\u22480.9324. \n\n1-0.9324=0.0676. \n\nDivide by 0.0058333: 0.0676/0.0058333\u224811.59. \n\n31.5 *11.59\u2248 31.5*10=315, 31.5*1.59\u224849.935. Total 364.935. Still higher. \n\nHmm, getting closer but still not 360. \n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the question expects the simple interest approach. Since using the annuity formula gives that the rate has to be higher than 5% to get PV down to 360, but none of the options except maybe 5% is close. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total interest divided by principal, so 18/360 = 5% per annum. Since that is an option, and perhaps the question is not considering the reducing balance method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the simple interest for each month. For example, each payment includes interest for one month. \n\nWait, let me think differently. The total amount paid is 378. The principal is 360. So total interest is 18. \n\nIf it's simple interest for the entire year, then 18/360 =5%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting the answer as 5%, so D. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a simple interest problem where the interest is calculated on the original principal for the entire period. \n\nYes, that's possible. Since in some cases, installment loans might have simple interest. \n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using the simple interest formula where the total interest is equal to the total payments minus principal, so that would be 5%. \n\nGiven that 5% is an option, and the other approaches are more complicated and don't fit exactly, I think the intended answer is D)5%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\n\nThe total amount paid back is 12 * 31.50 = 378 rupees. The principal is 360 rupees, so the interest paid is 378 - 360 = 18 rupees. Using the simple interest formula \\( I = P \\times R \\times T \\), where \\( I = 18 \\), \\( P = 360 \\), and \\( T = 1 \\) year, solving for \\( R \\) gives \\( R = \\frac{18}{360} = 0.05 \\) or 5%. This matches option D. While the reducing balance method would involve a more complex calculation, the problem likely assumes simple interest given the straightforward result and the provided options. \n\nAnswer: D",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about finding the interest rate when someone borrows money and pays it back in monthly installments. Let me think. The man borrows Rs.360 and pays back in 12 monthly installments of Rs.31.50 each. Hmm, right. The options are given, so maybe I can calculate the total amount paid and then figure out the interest rate.\n\nFirst, total amount paid would be 12 times 31.50. Let me compute that. 12 multiplied by 31.5. Let's see, 30 times 12 is 360, and 1.5 times 12 is 18, so total is 360 + 18 = 378. So the total repayment is Rs.378. The principal was 360, so the total interest paid is 378 minus 360, which is 18 rupees. \n\nNow, to find the interest rate. Wait, but interest rates can be simple or compound. Since the payments are monthly, maybe it's simple interest? Or maybe the question assumes simple interest? Let me think. The standard way for such problems might be simple interest unless stated otherwise. Let's check.\n\nSimple interest formula is I = P * R * T, where I is interest, P principal, R rate, T time in years. Here, the time is 1 year since 12 months. So T is 1. So rearranged, R = I/(P*T). Plugging in the numbers, I is 18, P is 360. So R = 18/(360 *1) = 0.05, which is 5%. Hmm, so that would be option D. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Because the installments are monthly, maybe the calculation is different? Because in reality, when you pay in installments, the interest is usually calculated on the reducing balance. So each month the principal reduces as you pay each installment. But in that case, the simple interest approach might not be accurate. \n\nHmm, the problem might be expecting the simple interest approach here because otherwise, the calculation becomes more complicated. Let me see. Let me think through both methods. \n\nFirst, the simple interest approach gives 5% as the answer, which is an option (D). But let me check the other way. If it's compound interest or using the reducing balance method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the total interest over the principal, so total interest is 18, so (18/360)*100 = 5%. That would be the simple interest rate. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider that each payment is made at the end of each month, then the total interest could be calculated differently. Let me try that. The total amount paid is 12 *31.50 = 378. The principal is 360, so total interest is 18. \n\nBut in an installment loan with monthly payments, the interest is typically calculated on the remaining principal each month. So the first month's payment would have some interest and some principal. Let's see if we can compute the rate that way. \n\nLet me try to compute the monthly rate. Let's denote the monthly interest rate as 'r'. The loan is paid off in 12 installments. The present value of all payments should equal the principal. \n\nThe formula for the present value of an annuity (since equal payments) is: \n\nPV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n ) / r ]\n\nHere, PV is 360, PMT is 31.50, n is 12. We need to find 'r', then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate? Or wait, no. Wait, the monthly rate would be r, so the annual rate would be 12r. \n\nSo rearranging the equation: 360 = 31.50 * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) / r ]\n\nHmm, solving for r here would require some trial and error since it's not straightforward algebra. Let me see if one of the options can fit. Let's check the options given. The options are 1.5%, 4.5%, 10%, 5%, 12%. Wait, those are annual rates. So if the question is asking for the annual rate, then the monthly rate would be the annual rate divided by 12. Let me check each option's monthly rate and see if it satisfies the equation.\n\nOption D is 5% annual. So monthly rate would be 5/12 % \u2248 0.4167%. Let me compute the present value with that rate. Let me try r = 0.0041667 (5%/12).\n\nFirst compute (1 + r)^-12. Since (1 + 0.0041667)^12 \u2248 e^(12*0.0041667) approximately, but exact calculation would be better. Alternatively, let me compute (1 + 0.05/12)^-12. Wait, actually, the monthly rate is 5%/12. Let me compute the denominator and numerator.\n\nLet me compute the factor:\n\n[1 - (1 + r)^-12 ] / r \n\nWith r = 0.05/12 \u2248 0.00416667\n\nCalculating (1 + 0.00416667)^-12. Let's see, (1.00416667)^12. Let me compute that step by step. Alternatively, since (1 + 0.05/12)^12 is approximately e^0.05, which is about 1.05116. So (1.00416667)^12 \u2248 1.05116, so 1/(1.05116) \u2248 0.9513. So 1 - 0.9513 \u2248 0.0487. Then divide by r (0.00416667):\n\n0.0487 / 0.00416667 \u2248 11.68. \n\nSo the present value factor is ~11.68. Multiply by payment 31.50: 31.50 * 11.68 \u2248 31.5 * 11.68. Let's compute that: 30*11.68 is 350.4, plus 1.5*11.68=17.52 \u2192 total 367.92. But the PV should be 360. Hmm, that's higher than 360, so the actual rate must be a bit higher than 0.0041667 (since higher rate would lower the PV). Let me try with a higher monthly rate. Let's try 0.005 (0.5% per month, which is 6% annual). Let's see:\n\nr = 0.005. Then (1 + 0.005)^12 = 1.0616778. So 1/(1.0616778) \u2248 0.94186. 1 - 0.94186 = 0.05814. Divide by 0.005 \u2192 0.05814 /0.005 = 11.628. Then PV = 31.50 * 11.628 \u2248 31.5 * 11.628 \u2248 366.37. Still higher than 360. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe trying with r=0.004 (0.4% monthly, 4.8% annual). Let's see:\n\n(1.004)^12 \u2248 1.0486 (approximate). So 1/(1.0486) \u2248 0.9537. 1 - 0.9537=0.0463. Divide by 0.004 \u2192 0.0463/0.004 = 11.575. Then 31.5 *11.575 \u2248 31.5*11= 346.5 plus 31.5*0.575 \u2248 18.1. So total 364.6. Still higher than 360. \n\nHmm, so at 4.8% annual (0.4% monthly), PV is ~364.6, which is still higher than 360. Let's try a higher rate. Let's try 0.006 (0.6% monthly \u2192 7.2% annual). \n\n(1.006)^12 \u2248 e^(0.072) \u2248 1.0747. So 1/1.0747 \u22480.9305. 1-0.9305=0.0695. 0.0695/0.006 = 11.583. Hmm, wait, no, wait 0.0695 divided by 0.006 is 11.583? Wait, 0.0695 /0.006 is 11.583? Wait 0.0695 divided by 0.006 is 11.583? Wait, 0.006 * 11 = 0.066, so 0.0695 is 0.0035 more. So 11.5833... \n\nSo PV would be 31.5 * 11.583 \u2248 31.5*11.583. Let's see, 30*11.583=347.49, 1.5*11.583=17.37. Total 347.49 +17.37 = 364.86. Hmm, that's still higher than 360. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the simple interest approach. Let me recheck that. The total interest is 18. Simple interest over one year would be 18/360 = 5%, so 5% is the answer. Since that's an option, and maybe the question is expecting that method. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total amount paid over principal divided by principal, so (378/360 -1)*100 = 5% as well. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is assuming simple interest but the time is 12 months, so same as one year, so yes, 5% is the rate. \n\nThe other method with the annuity calculation is more complex and the options don't include 5% as the correct answer if that's the case. Wait, but in my earlier trials, even at 5% the PV was around 367, which is more than 360, so that would mean that the actual rate is higher than 5% to bring down the PV to 360. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Let me try the 5% annual again. \n\nWait, monthly rate of 5%/12 is approx 0.004166667.\n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.004166667)^-12. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute the present value factor step by step. \n\nThe present value of each payment is 31.50/(1+r)^1 + 31.50/(1+r)^2 + ... + 31.50/(1+r)^12. The sum of this should be 360. \n\nAlternatively, let's try r= 0.05 (annual rate 5% but that's monthly? No, no, the monthly rate would be lower. Wait, maybe the question is simple interest, so the total interest is 18, so 18/360 *100 =5% so the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simple interest, so that's the way to go. \n\nBecause if it were compound interest with monthly payments, the calculation is more involved, and the answer might not be an option here. Let me check the options again. The options are 1.5,4.5,10,5,12. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting the simple interest rate. Because otherwise, with the annuity calculation, the correct rate would be higher than 5%, perhaps around 6% or so. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the simple interest method where the total interest is 18, so 18/360 = 0.05, so 5% per annum. Since that is an option, and the question is probably intended for that approach, the answer is D)5%.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there's another way. For example, the total amount paid back is 12 *31.5 = 378. The principal is 360. So the interest is 18. So the rate would be (18 / 360)*100 = 5%. \n\nYes, that's straightforward. So unless the question specifies compound interest or another method, the simple interest is the way to go. Since the question doesn't mention compounding, probably the answer is D)5%.\n",

Let me compute the present value with that rate. Let me try r = 0.0041667 (5%/12).\n\nFirst compute (1 + r)^-12.

Let's try 0.005 (0.5% per month, which is 6% annual). Let's see:\n\nr = 0.005. Then (1 + 0.005)^12 = 1.0616778. So 1/(1.0616778) \u2248 0.94186. 1 - 0.94186 = 0.05814. Divide by 0.005 \u2192 0.05814 /0.005 = 11.628. Then PV = 31.50 * 11.628 \u2248 31.5 * 11.628 \u2248 366.37. Still higher than 360. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe trying with r=0.004 (0.4% monthly, 4.8% annual). Let's see:\n\n(1.004)^12 \u2248 1.0486 (approximate). So 1/(1.0486) \u2248 0.9537. 1 - 0.9537=0.0463. Divide by 0.004 \u2192 0.0463/0.004 = 11.575. Then 31.5 *11.575 \u2248 31.5*11= 346.5 plus 31.5*0.575 \u2248 18.1. So total 364.6. Still higher than 360. \n\nHmm, so at 4.8% annual (0.4% monthly), PV is ~364.6, which is still higher than 360. Let's try a higher rate. Let's try 0.006 (0.6% monthly \u2192 7.2% annual). \n\n(1.006)^12 \u2248 e^(0.072) \u2248 1.0747. So 1/1.0747 \u22480.9305. 1-0.9305=0.0695. 0.0695/0.006 = 11.583. Hmm, wait, no, wait 0.0695 divided by 0.006 is 11.583? Wait, 0.0695 /0.006 is 11.583? Wait 0.0695 divided by 0.006 is 11.583? Wait, 0.006 * 11 = 0.066, so 0.0695 is 0.0035 more. So 11.5833... \n\nSo PV would be 31.5 * 11.583 \u2248 31.5*11.583. Let's see, 30*11.583=347.49, 1.5*11.583=17.37. Total 347.49 +17.37 = 364.86. Hmm, that's still higher than 360. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the simple interest approach. Let me recheck that. The total interest is 18. Simple interest over one year would be 18/360 = 5%, so 5% is the answer. Since that's an option, and maybe the question is expecting that method. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total amount paid over principal divided by principal, so (378/360 -1)*100 = 5% as well. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is assuming simple interest but the time is 12 months, so same as one year, so yes, 5% is the rate. \n\nThe other method with the annuity calculation is more complex and the options don't include 5% as the correct answer if that's the case. Wait, but in my earlier trials, even at 5% the PV was around 367, which is more than 360, so that would mean that the actual rate is higher than 5% to bring down the PV to 360. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Let me try the 5% annual again. \n\nWait, monthly rate of 5%/12 is approx 0.004166667.\n\nLet me compute (1 + 0.004166667)^-12. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to compute the present value factor step by step. \n\nThe present value of each payment is 31.50/(1+r)^1 + 31.50/(1+r)^2 + ... + 31.50/(1+r)^12. The sum of this should be 360. \n\nAlternatively, let's try r= 0.05 (annual rate 5% but that's monthly? No, no, the monthly rate would be lower. Wait, maybe the question is simple interest, so the total interest is 18, so 18/360 *100 =5% so the answer is D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is simple interest, so that's the way to go. \n\nBecause if it were compound interest with monthly payments, the calculation is more involved, and the answer might not be an option here. Let me check the options again. The options are 1.5,4.5,10,5,12. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is expecting the simple interest rate. Because otherwise, with the annuity calculation, the correct rate would be higher than 5%, perhaps around 6% or so. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is using the simple interest method where the total interest is 18, so 18/360 = 0.05, so 5% per annum. Since that is an option, and the question is probably intended for that approach, the answer is D)5%.\n\nAlternatively, let me think if there's another way. For example, the total amount paid back is 12 *31.5 = 378. The principal is 360. So the interest is 18. So the rate would be (18 / 360)*100 = 5%. \n\nYes, that's straightforward. So unless the question specifies compound interest or another method, the simple interest is the way to go. Since the question doesn't mention compounding, probably the answer is D)5%.\n\n\nThe man borrows Rs. 360 and repays it in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50. The total repayment amount is \\(12 \\times 31.50 = 378\\) rupees. The total interest paid is \\(378 - 360 = 18\\) rupees. Using the simple interest formula \\(I = P \\times R \\times T\\), where \\(I = 18\\), \\(P = 360\\), and \\(T = 1\\) year, solving for \\(R\\) gives \\(R = \\frac{18}{360} = 0.05\\) or 5%. \n\nConsidering the options and the straightforward calculation, the answer is **D)5%**, as the question likely assumes simple interest without compounding.\n\nAnswer: D",
