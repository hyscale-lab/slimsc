      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Charles invested some money, and after a year, he got back $54,080, which includes both the principal and the interest. The problem says the investment had an annual interest rate of 8% compounded semi-annually. I need to find out the original amount he invested. Hmm, right, compound interest formula time.\n\nLet me recall the formula for compound interest. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount after time t,\n- P is the principal (initial investment),\n- r is the annual interest rate (decimal),\n- n is the number of times interest is compounded per year,\n- t is the time in years.\n\nIn this case, the interest is compounded semi-annually, so n would be 2. The annual rate is 8%, which is 0.08 as a decimal. The time t is 1 year. So plugging into the formula:\n\nA = P*(1 + 0.08/2)^(2*1) = P*(1.04)^2.\n\nThe amount A is given as $54,080. So I can set up the equation:\n\n54,080 = P * (1.04)^2.\n\nI need to solve for P. Let me compute (1.04)^2 first. 1.04 squared is 1.0816, right? Because 1.04 times 1.04 is 1.0816. \n\nSo the equation becomes 54,080 = P * 1.0816. To find P, divide both sides by 1.0816:\n\nP = 54,080 / 1.0816.\n\nHmm, let me do this division. Let's see, maybe I can simplify this. Let me try dividing 54,080 by 1.0816. Alternatively, maybe I can cross-multiply or see if there's a better way. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, since 1.0816 is the factor, perhaps we can check the options. Let me look at the options given. The options are A)45k, B)50k, C)54k, D)59k, E)62k. Let me try plugging in the options to see which one gives 54,080 when multiplied by 1.0816.\n\nStarting with option B: $50,000. Let's calculate 50,000 * 1.0816. \n\n50,000 * 1.0816 = 50,000 * 1 + 50,000 * 0.0816 = 50,000 + (50,000 * 0.0816). \n\nCalculating 50,000 * 0.08 is 4,000, and 50,000 * 0.0016 is 80. So 0.0816 would be 4,000 + (0.0016*50,000). Wait, 0.08 is 8%, so 0.08 *50,000 is 4,000. Then 0.0016 *50,000 is 80. So total 4,080. So 50,000 +4,080 =54,080. Oh, exactly the amount given! So that must be the answer. So B is the correct option.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me check another option. Let's say if I tried option A: 45,000. 45k *1.0816. Let's see, 45,000 *1.08 =45,000*1.08 is 48,600. Then adding the extra 0.0016 part? Wait, maybe better to compute 45,000 *1.0816. Let me compute 45,000 *1.0816:\n\n45,000 *1 =45,000. 45,000 *0.08 =3,600. 45,000 *0.0016 =72. So adding those: 3,600 +72 =3,672. So total would be 45,000 +3,672 =48,672. Which is way less than 54k. So not A.\n\nOption C: 54,000. Then 54,000*(1.0816) would be way more than the amount given (since the final amount is 54,080, which is only 80 more than 54k). So that can't be. \n\nD is 59k. 59,000 *1.0816 would be higher than 54,080, so that's not.\n\nE is 62k, which would be even higher. So yes, B must be correct. \n\nAlternatively, if I do the division 54,080 /1.0816, let me compute that. Let me see:\n\n54,080 divided by 1.0816. Let's see, 1.0816 \u00d7 50,000 is 54,080, so that's exactly the same. So yeah, that's the principal. So the answer is B.\n",
