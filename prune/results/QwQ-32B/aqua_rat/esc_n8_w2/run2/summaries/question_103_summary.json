      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about men contributing money for a gift, and if some drop out, how much more each has to pay. Hmm. So, the original number of men is M, and the total cost is D rupees. If 3 drop out, then the remaining men are M minus 3. I need to find how much more each person has to contribute now compared to before.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the original contribution per person. That would be the total divided by the number of men, so D/M. Right. Then, when 3 drop out, the new number is M-3, so each has to pay D divided by (M-3). The question is asking how much more that is. So the difference between the new contribution and the old one.\n\nSo the extra amount per person would be [D/(M-3) ] minus [D/M]. Let me compute that. Let's see, to subtract these fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (M-3) and M. So multiply numerator and denominator accordingly. \n\nSo the difference is D*M/(M*(M-3)) minus D*(M-3)/(M*(M-3))? Wait, no. Wait, the first term is D/(M-3), so to get the common denominator of M*(M-3), the first term becomes D*M over that, and the second term is D*(M-3) over the same denominator. So subtracting gives [D*M - D*(M-3)] / [M*(M-3)].\n\nLet me compute the numerator: D*M - D*(M-3) = D[M - (M-3)] = D*(3). So the numerator is 3D, and denominator is M*(M-3). So the extra amount is 3D/(M(M-3)). Hmm. Let's check the options. Option D is 3D/(M squared minus 3M). Oh, because M squared minus 3M is M(M-3). So that's exactly the same as what I have here. So the answer should be D?\n\nWait but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me go through again. Original contribution per person: D/M. After 3 leave, new per person is D/(M-3). The increase is D/(M-3) - D/M. Yes, that's correct. Then, when I subtract those two fractions:\n\nLet me compute D/(M-3) - D/M. Factor out D: D[1/(M-3) - 1/M]. The expression inside the brackets is (M - (M-3)) / [M(M-3)] which is (3)/[M(M-3)]. So the total is D*(3)/(M(M-3)), so 3D/(M(M-3)). The denominator can be written as M\u00b2 - 3M. So that's exactly option D. So the correct answer is D. \n\nWait but looking at the options again. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA) D/(M-3)\n\nB) MD/3\n\nC) M/(D-3)\n\nD)3D/(M\u00b2 -3M)\n\nE) None of these.\n\nYes, so option D matches exactly. So the answer should be D. Therefore, the correct choice is D. So I think the answer is D.\n",
