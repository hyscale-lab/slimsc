      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about two machines producing yo-yos at different intervals, and we need to find out after how many minutes they will have produced a total of 10 yo-yos together. Hmm. So Machine A makes a yo-yo every 6 minutes, and Machine B every 9 minutes. I need to figure out when their combined output reaches 10.\n\nFirst, maybe I should think about how many each machine produces over time. Like, maybe find out how many each makes in a certain time and add them up until the total is 10. But how do I do that efficiently?\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is a least common multiple problem? Wait, not sure. Let me think again. The question is asking for the time when their combined total is exactly 10. So perhaps I need to track the number each produces over time and find the earliest time when the sum is 10.\n\nLet me try to approach it step by step. Let's denote the time in minutes as t. The number of yo-yos from Machine A by time t is t divided by 6, rounded down. Similarly, Machine B is t divided by 9, rounded down. The total would be the sum of those two. We need to find the smallest t where that sum is at least 10. Wait, but the question says \"will have produced 10 yo-yos\" \u2014 so maybe exactly 10? Or at least 10? Hmm, the wording says \"produced 10 yo-yos\", so I think it's when the total reaches exactly 10. So the earliest time when the sum is exactly 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is when the combined total is at least 10, but the answer options might require an exact. Let me see.\n\nLet me try calculating for each option given. Let's check each answer choice and see which one gives a total of 10.\n\nOption C is 36 minutes. Let's see. For Machine A: 36 divided by 6 is exactly 6. So 6 yo-yos. For Machine B: 36 divided by 9 is 4. So 4. Total is 6+4=10. Oh! That adds up exactly. So 36 minutes would be the answer?\n\nWait, but let me check the other options just to be sure. Let's see option E: 72 minutes. Then A would have 12, B 8, total 20. That's way over. Option C is 36. Let me check a lower option. Like option B: 32 minutes.\n\nFor 32 minutes, Machine A: 32/6 is 5.333... so 5 whole yo-yos. Machine B: 32/9 is about 3.555..., so 3. Total 5+3=8. Not enough. Option C is 36, which gives exactly 10. \n\nWhat about option E, 72 is way higher, so 36 is the earliest. Let me check the other options. Option A: 24. A gives 24/6=4, B gives 24/9=2.666, so 2. So total 6. Not enough. Option D is 64. 64/6=10.666, so 10, and 64/9\u22487.111, so 7. Total 17. That's way over. So the correct answer must be C)36 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a time before 36 where the total is 10. Let me check. Let me think of possible times step by step. Let me see:\n\nLet me see when each machine produces a yo-yo. \n\nMachine A produces at 6,12,18,24,30,36, etc.\n\nMachine B produces at 9, 18,27,36, etc.\n\nSo, let's list the number each produces over time:\n\nTime: 6: A1, B0 \u2192 total 1\n\nTime 9: A1 (since 9 isn't a multiple of 6 except once), B1 \u2192 total 2.\n\nAt 12: A2 (since 12/6=2), B1 (since 9 is the only one under 12) \u2192 total 3.\n\n18: A3 (18/6=3), B2 (18/9=2) \u2192 total 5.\n\n24: A4, B2 (since 24/9=2.666 so 2) \u2192 total 6.\n\n30: A5 (30/6=5), B3 (30/9\u22483.333 \u2192 3). Total 5+3=8.\n\n36: A6, B4 \u2192 total 10. So that's exactly at 36. So yes, that's the first time when the total reaches 10. So the answer is C.\n",

So Machine A makes a yo-yo every 6 minutes, and Machine B every 9 minutes. The question is asking for the time when the combined number of yo-yos from both machines reaches 10.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how many yo-yos each machine produces over time and add them up until the total is 10. But maybe there's a smarter way than just adding step by step. Like, perhaps using the least common multiple (LCM) of their intervals to find when they both produce a yo-yo at the same time, and then see how many cycles that takes?\n\nWait, but the question is about the total number of yo-yos, not when they coincide. So maybe I should model the number each produces over time and find the time when their sum is 10.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the time in minutes as t. The number of yo-yos from Machine A by time t would be t divided by 6, but since they can only produce whole yo-yos, it's actually the floor of t/6. Similarly for Machine B, it's floor(t/9). The total would be floor(t/6) + floor(t/9). We need this sum to equal 10.\n\nHmm, but working with floor functions might complicate things. Maybe instead of that, I can think of it incrementally. Let's see how many yo-yos each machine produces every minute and track the total. But that might take a while. Alternatively, perhaps find the LCM of 6 and 9 to see when they both produce together. LCM of 6 and 9 is 18, right? So every 18 minutes, both machines produce a yo-yo at the same time. \n\nWait, but maybe that's useful. Let me see. Let's see how many yo-yos each machine makes in 18 minutes. Machine A would make 18/6 = 3, and Machine B 18/9 = 2. So together that's 5 yo-yos every 18 minutes. Oh, that's a good point. So in 18 minutes, they make 3 + 2 =5. So if I can figure out how many cycles of 18 minutes are needed to reach 10, then maybe?\n\nWait, 5 per 18 minutes. So 2 cycles would be 36 minutes, giving 10 yo-yos. Wait, that would be exactly 10? Let me check. 36 minutes divided by 6 is 6, so Machine A makes 6. 36 divided by 9 is 4, so B makes 4. 6+4=10. Oh!

Let me check each option to be thorough.\n\nStarting with option C)36: as above, 6+4=10. So that works. Let me check option A)24 minutes. For 24, Machine A: 24/6=4, B:24/9=2.666..., but since it's every 9 minutes, the number would be floor(24/9) which is 2. So total 4+2=6. Not 10. So A is too early.\n\nOption B)32 minutes. Let's see. A:32/6 is 5.333, so 5 yo-yos (since after 30 minutes it's 5, but at 32, it's still 5). B: 32/9 is ~3.555, so 3. So total 5+3=8. Not 10 yet. So 32 is not enough.\n\nOption C is 36, which works. Option D)64: Let's check. A:64/6 \u224810.666, so 10. B:64/9\u22487.111, so 7. 10+7=17, which is way over. So way too long. E)72: A would have 12, B 8, total 20. So way over.\n\nSo the correct answer must be C, 36 minutes. But wait, let me think again. What if the question is when the total reaches exactly 10? Like, maybe before 36, but maybe exactly at 36, that's when it hits 10. So that's correct. The other options don't add up. So I think the answer is C.\n",
