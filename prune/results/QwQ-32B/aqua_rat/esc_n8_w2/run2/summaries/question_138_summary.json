      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. So the problem is about Ram and Krishna starting from points A and B, going towards each other. Their speeds are 20 m/s and 40 m/s. They meet at point C after 10 seconds. I need to find the total distance between A and B. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's think step by step. When two people start moving towards each other, their speeds add up, right? Because they're approaching each other. So the combined speed would be 20 + 40, which is 60 m/s. \n\nThe time taken until they meet is 10 seconds. So the total distance between A and B should be the combined speed multiplied by the time, right? Because distance equals speed multiplied by time. So 60 m/s times 10 seconds would give the total distance. \n\nCalculating that: 60 * 10 = 600. Wait, but let me check the options. Option E is 600 meters. But hold on, maybe I made a mistake here? Let me double-check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate each distance separately and add them. Let's see. Ram's distance when they meet would be his speed multiplied by time. So 20 m/s * 10 s = 200 meters. Krishna's distance would be 40 m/s * 10 s = 400 meters. Adding those two distances (200 + 400) gives 600 meters total. So that's the same as before. \n\nHmm, so that would be option E. But wait, the options include 700 meters as A. Did I do something wrong here? Let me check again. Oh, maybe I misread the speeds? The problem says Ram is 20 m/s and Krishna 40 m/s. Yeah, that's correct. Time is 10 seconds. So 20+40=60, 60*10 is indeed 600. \n\nLooking at the options again: A is 700, B 1000, C 700 km which is way too big (probably a trick option), D 555, E 600. So the correct answer should be E. But wait, maybe there's a trick here? Like maybe they started at the same time but the question says \"along the same route\" so direction is correct. Oh, perhaps I missed a unit conversion? The problem says meters per second, and the answer is in meters, so units are okay. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where they start at the same point? No, because they start from A and B, moving towards each other. So the total distance between A and B must be the sum of the distances each traveled until meeting. Which is exactly 600. So the answer should be E. But why is option A 700? Maybe I miscalculated. Let me see:\n\nRam: 20 *10 = 200. Krishna:40*10=400. 200+400=600. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer must be E. Then why is 700 there? Maybe a common mistake if someone adds 20+40*10, but that would be 420, which isn't an option. Or maybe 20*10 + 40*10 is 600. So I think E is correct. \n",

I need to find the total distance between A and B. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that when two objects move towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Because they're moving towards each other, the distance between them decreases at a rate equal to both their speeds combined. \n\nRam's speed is 20 m/s, and Krishna's is 40 m/s. Adding those together gives 20 + 40 = 60 m/s. That means every second, the distance between them reduces by 60 meters. \n\nNow, they meet after 10 seconds. So the total distance they covered together in those 10 seconds should be equal to the original distance between A and B. Because when they meet, they've covered the entire distance between the two points. \n\nLet me check that thought. Yes, because if they start at the same time and move towards each other, the sum of the distances they each traveled will be the total distance when they meet. \n\nCalculating each of their distances: \n\nRam's distance = speed \u00d7 time = 20 m/s \u00d7 10 s = 200 meters. \n\nKrishna's distance = 40 m/s \u00d7 10 s = 400 meters. \n\nAdding those together: 200 + 400 = 600 meters. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, 600 meters is option E.
