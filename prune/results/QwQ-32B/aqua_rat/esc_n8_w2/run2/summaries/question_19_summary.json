      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. The problem gives me some information: the average of the highest and lowest is x, the overall average is y, and there are z students. Hmm.\n\nFirst, let's recall that the average score for the entire class is y. So the total sum of all the scores would be the average multiplied by the number of students, right? That means total sum is y times z, so y*z. Got that part.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the average when we exclude the highest and lowest scores. So I need to subtract those two scores from the total and then divide by (z - 2) since there are z students minus the two excluded. \n\nBut I don't know the individual highest and lowest scores, just their average. The average of the highest and lowest is x, so (highest + lowest)/2 = x. That means the sum of the highest and lowest is 2x. Oh, right, because if I multiply both sides by 2, that's what I get. \n\nSo the total sum without those two would be total sum minus 2x. Which is y*z - 2x. Then, the average of the remaining students would be that sum divided by (z - 2), because there are z - 2 students left. \n\nPutting that together, the formula would be (y*z - 2x)/(z - 2). Let me check the options again. \n\nLooking at the options, D is (zy \u2013 2x)/(z -2). Oh, zy is the same as yz, so that's the same as what I have. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. \n\nWait, let me go through the steps again. Total sum is y*z. Subtract the highest and lowest, whose sum is 2x, so total becomes yz -2x. Then divide by (z-2) students. Yep, so the formula is exactly (yz -2x)/(z-2). So D should be the correct answer. \n\nLet me check the other options. Option A is (zy-2x)/z. That would be if you divided by z instead of z-2, so that's not right. Option B has 2 instead of 2x, which doesn't make sense because the average of highest and lowest is x, so their total is 2x. Option C has zx - y, which seems off. Option E has z+2 in the denominator, which is the opposite. So D is definitely the right choice here.\n",
