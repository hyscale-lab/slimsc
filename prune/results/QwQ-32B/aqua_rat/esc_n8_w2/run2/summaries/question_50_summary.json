      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about percentage changes. Let me see. The product's price is reduced by 30%, and then we need to find out by what percentage it should be increased to bring it back to the original price. Hmm, right. \n\nAlright, let me think step by step. Let's say the original price is, say, $100 to make it easy. If the price is reduced by 30%, then the new price is 70% of the original. Because 100 minus 30% of 100 is 70. So after the discount, it's $70.\n\nNow, the question is asking, what percentage increase from this new price ($70) will bring it back to the original $100. So we need to find the percentage increase required from 70 to 100. \n\nThe formula for percentage increase is [(Final - Initial)/Initial] * 100. Here, the initial after the discount is 70, and the final needed is 100. \n\nCalculating that: (100 -70)/70 = 30/70. Let me compute that. 30 divided by 70 is 0.428571... So multiplying by 100 gives approximately 42.8571%. \n\nLooking at the options, that rounds to 42.86%, which is option B. Let me check the options again. Option B is 42.86%, so that's the right one. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because sometimes percentage increase can be tricky. Let me rephrase. Suppose the original price is P. After a 30% decrease, the new price is 0.7P. Let the required percentage increase be x%. Then, 0.7P * (1 + x/100) = P. Solving for x: \n\nDivide both sides by 0.7P: 1 + x/100 = 1 / 0.7. \n\n1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 1.428571. Subtracting 1 gives x/100 = 0.428571, so x is 42.8571%, which is exactly what I had before. So yeah, that's 42.8571%, which rounds to 42.86%, so B is correct. \n\nHmm, the options are given as A to E, with B being 42.86. So the answer should be B. Let me check if any of the other options are close. The next one is C at 43.86, which is a bit higher, but no, the exact value is about 42.857, so B is spot on. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that's right.\n",

The product's price is reduced by 30%, and then we need to find by what percentage it should be increased to bring it back to the original 100%. Hmm, right. I remember that percentage changes can be tricky because increasing after a decrease isn't the same as just adding the same percentage.\n\nLet me think. Let's say the original price is, say, $100. That might make it easier. If the price is reduced by 30%, then the new price is 70% of the original. So 70% of 100 is $70. Now, we need to find what percentage increase from $70 will bring it back to $100. \n\nThe formula for percentage increase is: ((Final - Initial)/Initial) * 100. Here, the initial after the discount is $70, and the final needed is $100. So the difference is $30. So the increase needed is 30/70. Let me calculate that. 30 divided by 70 equals... 0.42857... So multiplying by 100 gives 42.857... percent. \n\nLooking at the options, that's approximately 42.86%, which is option B. Wait, but let me check my steps again. Did I do that right?\n\nOriginal price: 100. After 30% decrease: 70. To get back to 100 from 70, the increase needed is 30 over 70. Exactly. So 30/70 is 0.4285..., which is 42.857%, so rounded to two decimal places, that's 42.86%. So the answer should be B. Let me see the options again. Option B is 42.86%, yes. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to think about it. Let's do it algebraically. Let the original price be P. After a 30% decrease, the new price is P*(1 - 0.30) = 0.70P. Let the required percentage increase be x%. So, we need 0.70P * (1 + x/100) = P. Solving for x: (1 + x/100) = 1 / 0.70. 1 divided by 0.7 is approximately 1.42857. So x/100 = 0.42857, so x is 42.857%, which again rounds to 42.86%. Yep, so definitely B. \n\nI think that's solid. The key here is understanding that the percentage increase is relative to the decreased price, not the original. So the answer is B.\n",
