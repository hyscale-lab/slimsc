      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the distance traveled by a point on the edge of a fan blade. The question gives me the radius, which is 10 centimeters from the center. The fan is rotating at 300 revolutions per minute, and we need the distance after 30 seconds. Hmm, right. \n\nFirst, I remember that distance traveled in circular motion is related to the circumference and the number of revolutions. The formula for circumference is 2\u03c0r. So the circumference here would be 2 * \u03c0 * 10 cm, which is 20\u03c0 cm per revolution. \n\nNow, the fan is doing 300 revolutions per minute. But the time given is 30 seconds, which is half a minute. So I need to adjust the rate to per second or convert the time. Let me think. Let's see, 300 revolutions per minute means that in one minute (60 seconds), it does 300 revolutions. So in 30 seconds, which is half the time, it would do half the number of revolutions. So 300 divided by 2 is 150 revolutions in 30 seconds. \n\nSo the total distance is the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference. That would be 150 * 20\u03c0. Let me calculate that: 150 times 20 is 3000. So 3000\u03c0 centimeters. Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D is 3000pi, so that would be the answer? \n\nWait, hold on. Let me go through again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nRadius is 10 cm. Circumference is 2\u03c0r = 2*\u03c0*10 = 20\u03c0 cm. Correct. \n\nRevolutions per minute: 300. So per second, that's 300/60 = 5 revolutions per second. Then in 30 seconds, that's 5 * 30 = 150 revolutions. Yep, same as before. \n\nMultiply 150 by circumference (20\u03c0): 150 *20 = 3000. So 3000\u03c0 cm. That's option D. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options are A)750pi, B)1500, C)1875, D)3000, E)7500. So D is there. Wait, but maybe I messed up the time conversion? Let me confirm. \n\n30 seconds is 0.5 minutes. So 300 rpm * 0.5 minutes = 150 revolutions. Yep, that's right. So the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for something else? Like angular velocity in radians? But no, the question specifically says distance traveled, which is linear, so the circumference approach is right. \n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication? Let's see 150 times 20. 150*20: 100*20 is 2000, 50*20 is 1000, so total 3000. Yeah. So the answer must be D. \n\nBut wait, another thought: sometimes people confuse radius with diameter. Wait the problem says \"a point on the edge of a fan blade that is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center\". Oh, that's the radius. So the radius is 10 cm. So the circumference calculation was correct. \n\nOkay, so I think D is correct. Let me check the options again. Yes, D is 3000pi. So I think that's the right answer.\n",

Hmm, so first, I remember that the distance traveled in circular motion is related to the circumference and the number of revolutions. \n\nWait, the formula for the circumference of a circle is 2\u03c0r, right? So each full revolution, the point goes around the circumference once. So the total distance should be the number of revolutions multiplied by the circumference. \n\nBut first, let's get the units right. The fan's speed is given in revolutions per minute, but the time is in seconds. I need to convert that. The time is 30 seconds, which is half a minute.

So no, that's right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question said 10 centimeters from the center, which is the radius. So that part is correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the RPM calculation?

But no, the question clearly states the distance traveled, which is the total path length, so it should be the number of revolutions times circumference. \n\nSo I think D is correct.
