      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the marked price for this sewing machine. Let me see. The problem says that Karan buys it for 1200 rupees and wants to make a 20% profit even after giving a 20% discount. Hmm, right. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the cost price is 1200. He wants a 20% profit on that. So what's the selling price he needs after the discount? Let me calculate the desired profit. 20% of 1200 is 240, so the selling price should be 1200 + 240 = 1440. Wait, that's the selling price after the discount. But the discount is 20%, so the marked price must be higher. \n\nWait, the discount is applied on the marked price, right? So the selling price after discount is 80% of the marked price. Because 100% minus 20% discount. So let me denote the marked price as M. Then, after 20% discount, the selling price becomes 0.8 * M. This selling price needs to equal the desired amount that gives him 20% profit. \n\nSo the equation would be 0.8*M = 1200 + (20% of 1200). Which is 0.8*M = 1440. Then solving for M would be 1440 divided by 0.8. Let me do that calculation. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 1440 divided by 0.8. Well, 1440 divided by 8 is 180, so times 10 would be 1800? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 0.8 times 1800 is 1440. So then M would be 1800. But wait, option E is 1800. But wait, the options include 1875 and others. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait a second, maybe I messed up the calculation. Let me check again. 20% of 1200 is 240, so the selling price needs to be 1440. The discount is 20% off the marked price. So marked price times 0.8 equals 1440. So M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me compute that. 1440 divided by 0.8. 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is multiplying by 5/4. 1440 * 5/4 = (1440 divided by 4 is 360) times 5 = 1800. Oh, so that gives 1800. But the options have E as 1800. Hmm, but why are there other options? Maybe I misunderstood the problem?\n\nWait, perhaps the profit percentage is calculated on the selling price after discount, not the cost price? Wait, no, profit percentage is usually on cost unless stated otherwise. The question says \"he makes 20% profit\" which would be on cost. Let me confirm the question again. The question says \"even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit\". So the profit is 20% of cost. So my initial calculation seems correct. Then why is there an option B as 1875? Maybe I made a mistake in the steps. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 20% profit is on the selling price. Wait, that's a different way. Let me check that possibility. Suppose the profit is 20% of the selling price. Then the cost would be 80% of the selling price. Let's see. Let me try that approach. If selling price is S, then cost is 80% of S, so 1200 = 0.8 S \u2192 S = 1200 /0.8 = 1500. Then the selling price would be 1500, and the marked price would be S /0.8 = 1500 /0.8 = 1875. That would be option B. Hmm, so which interpretation is correct?\n\nThe question says \"makes 20% profit\". Typically, profit percentage is calculated on cost unless specified otherwise. So the first approach should be correct, leading to 1800. But then why is 1875 an option? Maybe there's confusion here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the discount and profit are calculated. Let me rephrase the problem again.\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nCost price (CP) = 1200.\n\nDesired profit is 20% on CP. So desired profit = 20% of 1200 = 240. Therefore, desired selling price (SP) = 1200 + 240 = 1440.\n\nThe discount is 20% on the marked price (MP). So SP = MP - 20% of MP = 80% of MP. So SP = 0.8 * MP.\n\nWe have SP = 1440, so MP = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800. So answer E. But option B is 1875. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the desired selling price. Let me think again. Suppose that the 20% profit is on the selling price. Then, the profit would be 20% of SP, so CP = SP - 20% of SP = 80% SP. So SP = CP / 0.8 = 1200 / 0.8 = 1500. Then, SP is 1500, so MP must be 1500 /0.8 = 1875. So that's B. \n\nSo the confusion is between profit on cost vs profit on selling price. The question says \"20% profit\" which is typically on cost. But maybe the question's wording is ambiguous?\n\nWait, the problem says \"he makes 20% profit\". The standard way is profit percentage on cost. So the first calculation is correct. Then the answer would be E, 1800. But looking at the options, 1800 is E. However, in some contexts, profit can be calculated on the selling price. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe question is: \"so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit\".\n\nTypically, profit percentage is on cost unless specified otherwise. So the first approach is right, leading to E. But why is option B present?\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me recheck the first scenario again.\n\nIf the desired SP is 1440 (20% over cost), then MP is 1440 /0.8 = 1800. So E is correct. But perhaps there's a mistake here? Let me see:\n\nWait, 20% of 1200 is 240, so total SP needed is 1440. So marked price must be 1440 /0.8. 1440 divided by 0.8 is indeed 1800. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so why is 1875 an option? Let me check the other approach again. If profit is 20% of SP, then:\n\nLet SP be S. Then profit is 20% of S. So CP = S - 0.2 S = 0.8 S \u2192 1200 = 0.8 S \u2192 S= 1500. Then, SP is 1500. So MP is 1500/0.8= 1875. So that would be B. So which is it?\n\nThe problem says \"makes 20% profit\". The standard formula is profit percentage is on cost unless stated otherwise. So in that case, the answer is E, 1800. But looking at the options, perhaps the problem expects profit on SP. Let me see the options again.\n\nWait the options given are A)1879, B)1875, C)1876, D)1872, E)1800. So E is 1800. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is from an Indian context. In some Indian textbooks, profit percentage can be calculated on SP. Wait, but I thought it's usually on cost. Let me confirm.\n\nWait, according to standard definitions, profit percentage is calculated on cost price unless stated otherwise. So 20% profit would mean 20% of cost. So then the answer is E. But maybe the question expects the other way. Let me see what the options suggest.\n\nWait, if the answer is 1875, then that would be the case if the profit is 20% of SP. Let me see the steps again for that approach.\n\nSuppose profit is 20% on SP:\n\nLet SP = S.\n\nProfit = 20% of S.\n\nSo CP = S - (20% of S) = 80% of S \u2192 1200 = 0.8 S \u2192 S = 1500.\n\nThen, since discount is 20%, the marked price is S / 0.8 \u2192 1500 /0.8 = 1875. So that's B.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is expecting that. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me see. Let's test both scenarios.\n\nIf the marked price is 1800:\n\nAfter 20% discount, SP is 1440. Profit is 1440 - 1200 = 240. 240/1200 = 20% profit on cost. That's correct.\n\nIf marked price is 1875:\n\nAfter 20% discount, SP is 1500. Profit is 300. 300/1200 is 25% profit on cost. But the question requires 20% profit. So that's higher. So that would be incorrect.\n\nAh! Wait, so if the marked price is 1875, then the profit would be 300, which is 25% of cost. Which is more than the required 20%. So that approach would be wrong. So the correct calculation is the first one, leading to 1800. So the answer should be E.\n\nBut why is 1875 an option? Maybe someone thought of profit on SP, but that would give a higher profit. Alternatively, perhaps the question is worded differently.\n\nWait the question says \"even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit\". So the 20% profit is after the discount. So the profit is 20% of cost. So the first calculation is correct.\n\nSo the correct answer is E)1800. But let me check the options again. The options are given as:\n\nA)1,879\n\nB)1,875\n\nC)1,876\n\nD)1,872\n\nE)1,800\n\nYes, so E is 1800. But maybe the options have a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the first approach again. Let me do it step by step.\n\nCost = 1200. Desired profit is 20% on cost. So desired profit = 0.2*1200 = 240. So selling price must be 1200 +240 = 1440. \n\nThe discount is 20% on the marked price. So selling price is 80% of marked price. So 1440 = 0.8 * M. \n\nSolving for M: M = 1440 / 0.8 = 1800. So yes, that's correct. So E is correct. \n\nSo the answer must be E. But why is option B there? Maybe the question intended profit on SP. Let me check that scenario again. \n\nIf profit is 20% on SP, then SP would be 1500. Then M = 1500 /0.8 = 1875. But that gives a higher profit (25% on cost). Since the question says he wants 20% profit, that approach would be wrong. So the correct answer is E.\n\nHmm, maybe the options are wrong? Or perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in Indian context where \"profit\" is sometimes expressed differently? Not sure. But according to standard calculations, the answer should be E. \n\nWait, but the options given include 1875. Maybe I made an error in the calculation steps. Let me do the math again.\n\nCalculating 1440 divided by 0.8:\n\n0.8 times 1800: 0.8 * 1800 = 1440. Correct.\n\nSo the marked price should be 1800. So the correct answer is E. So the answer is E. The other options are distractions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question says 20% discount and 20% profit over the cost, but the discount is applied after considering the profit? Wait, no. The problem states that after the discount, the profit is 20%. So the steps are correct.\n\nYes, I think I'm confident now that the answer is E)1800. But the options have B as 1875, which is a common trap if someone calculates profit on SP. But the question says \"makes 20% profit\", which is on cost. So I'll go with E.\n",

Hmm, let's think step by step here.\n\nFirst, the cost price for Karan is Rs. 1200. He wants a 20% profit on this. So what's the selling price he needs to get after the discount? Let me calculate the desired selling price first. \n\nProfit is calculated on the cost price. So 20% of 1200 is 0.2 * 1200 = 240. So the selling price after discount should be 1200 + 240 = Rs. 1440. Wait, right. Because selling price needs to cover the cost plus the desired profit. \n\nBut the customer is going to get a 20% discount on the marked price. Let me denote the marked price as M. So the selling price after discount is 80% of M, since 100% - 20% discount = 80%. So, 0.8 * M should equal the required selling price of 1440. \n\nSo setting up the equation: 0.8 * M = 1440. To find M, divide both sides by 0.8. Let me do that. 1440 divided by 0.8. Hmm, 1440 divided by 0.8. Well, 1440 divided by 8 is 180, then multiply by 10 gives 1800. Wait, that would make M 1800? But wait, looking at the options, E is 1800. But wait, the options have B as 1875 and others. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nWait, let me check again. The required selling price after discount must be 1440. So 0.8 * M = 1440. So M = 1440 / 0.8. Let me calculate that again. 1440 divided by 0.8. \n\nAlternatively, 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is multiplying by 5/4. 1440 *5 = 7200. 7200 divided by 4 is 1800. So that would be 1800. But option E is 1800. But why are there other options like 1875?\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read again. The question says \"so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit.\" So the 20% profit is on cost, right? So my calculation seems correct. But why is 1800 an option? But the options given include B as 1875, which is higher. Maybe I made a mistake here. Or perhaps there's a different interpretation?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 20% profit is on the selling price? Wait, no, usually profit percentage is on cost unless stated otherwise. Let me confirm that. The standard is that profit percentage is calculated on cost price unless mentioned otherwise. \n\nHmm. Let me check the calculation again. Cost is 1200. Desired profit is 20%, so SP should be 1200 *1.2 = 1440. The discount is 20% on the marked price. So marked price minus 20% is SP. So SP = 0.8*M. Therefore, M = SP /0.8 = 1440 /0.8 = 1800. So the answer should be E) 1800. But the options given include B as 1875. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see the options again. The options are A)1879, B)1875, C)1876, D)1872, E)1800. So E is there. But the question is in the problem. Wait, maybe I miscalculated something else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 20% profit is after the discount, but calculated on the selling price? Wait, if the profit is 20% on the selling price, then the calculation would be different. Let me think. Suppose the profit is 20% of the selling price. Then:\n\nLet SP be the selling price after discount. Then, Profit = 20% of SP. So Cost = SP - 20% SP = 0.8 SP. So 0.8 SP = 1200 \u2192 SP = 1200 /0.8 = 1500. Then, the marked price would be SP /0.8 = 1500 /0.8 = 1875. Which is option B. \n\nAh! So here's the confusion. The problem states \"makes 20% profit\". The question is, is that 20% on cost or on selling price? The standard is that profit percentage is on cost unless stated otherwise. But maybe in some contexts, it's on the selling price. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe question says: \"so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?\" Usually, profit percentage is on cost. But perhaps in some regions or contexts, it's based on selling price. Wait, the problem might be from an Indian context, since the currency is rupees and the name Karan. Let me recall. In India, profit percentage is typically calculated on cost. So according to that, the answer would be 1800 (E). But why is 1875 an option here?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the problem's interpretation. Let me check the problem again. The question says \"even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit\". The 20% profit is on cost, so the SP should be 1200 *1.2 =1440. So M must be 1440 /0.8 =1800. So that's E. But perhaps the options have a typo, but the given options include E as 1800. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the 20% discount is on the marked price, and the 20% profit is on the marked price? No, that would be odd. Profit is on cost. \n\nHmm. Let me see the options again. If the answer is E, then that's straightforward. But why is B an option? Let me recalculate the alternate scenario where profit is 20% on SP. \n\nSuppose that the profit is 20% of the selling price. So SP = cost + 20% of SP. So SP - 0.2 SP = cost \u2192 0.8 SP = 1200 \u2192 SP = 1500. Then marked price would be 1500 /0.8 = 1875, which is B. \n\nSo the problem is ambiguous unless the question specifies whether the profit is on cost or selling price. Since the problem didn't specify, but in standard practice, profit percentage is on cost. So the answer should be E. But why is option B present? Let me see the options again. The options are A)1879, B)1875, C)1876, D)1872, E)1800. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal cost: 1200. Desired profit 20% on cost \u2192 1200 *1.2 = 1440. So selling price after discount must be 1440. The discount is 20%, so marked price M is such that 80% of M = 1440 \u2192 M = 1440 /0.8 = 1800. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E. But the options include B as 1875, which would be the case if profit is on SP. But unless the question states that, the answer should be E. \n\nWait, maybe the question is from an exam where the convention is that profit is on SP? Let me think. For example, in some textbooks, profit percentage can be based on cost unless stated otherwise, so the answer should be E. Alternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a step I missed. Let me think again. \n\nAnother approach: Let me denote variables. Let M be the marked price. After a 20% discount, the selling price is 0.8M. \n\nThe cost is 1200. The profit is 20% of cost, so profit is 240. Therefore, selling price must be 1200 + 240 = 1440. \n\nSo 0.8M = 1440 \u2192 M = 1440 /0.8 = 1800. So yes, that's E. \n\nTherefore, unless there's a trick in the question, the answer must be E. However, the presence of B as 1875 suggests that perhaps the question expects profit to be calculated on the selling price. Let me recalculate that way. \n\nSuppose that the 20% profit is on the selling price. \n\nLet SP be the selling price. Profit = 20% of SP. \n\nSo, Cost price = SP - Profit \u2192 1200 = SP - 0.2 SP \u2192 1200 = 0.8 SP \u2192 SP = 1200 /0.8 = 1500. \n\nThen, the marked price M must satisfy 0.8 M = 1500 \u2192 M= 1500 /0.8 = 1875. Which is option B. \n\nHmm, so depending on the interpretation, the answer could be E or B. But which is correct?\n\nThe problem states \"makes 20% profit\". In business terms, profit percentage is usually on cost unless specified. For example, if you buy something for $100 and sell for $120, that's 20% profit on cost. If it were on SP, then $120 would be 16.66% profit on cost. \n\nBut maybe in the problem's context, it's different. Let me check the problem's wording again. The question is in the context of a merchant (Karan) setting a marked price and giving a discount. The standard approach here would be that the profit percentage is on cost. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be E) 1800. However, the options include B)1875 which would be the case if profit is on SP. Since the problem didn't specify, perhaps the question assumes profit is on the cost. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in calculation steps. Let me see again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit\". The profit here is likely on cost, so the answer is E. \n\nBut the options given include B as 1875. Let me check the options again. The options are A)1,879; B)1,875; C)1,876; D)1,872; E)1,800. So E is the fifth option. \n\nHmm. The problem must be expecting the answer as B? Or maybe I made a mistake. Wait, perhaps there's a different way to calculate. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 20% discount is on the marked price, and the 20% profit is on the marked price? No, that wouldn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in Indian context, and the profit percentage is calculated differently? Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the question says \"20% profit\" but the cost includes some other factors? No, the cost is given as 1200. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the answer to be 1875, so maybe I made a mistake in the first approach. Let me recheck. \n\nWait, let's think of an example. Suppose the marked price is 1800. Then 20% discount is 360, so selling price is 1440. Profit is 1440-1200=240. 240/1200 is 20% profit. So that works. \n\nIf the marked price is 1875, then discount is 20% of 1875 = 375. Selling price is 1500. Profit is 300. 300/1200 is 25% profit. Wait, that's 25% profit on cost. So that would be a 25% profit, not 20. So that can't be. \n\nAh, so if the answer is B (1875), then that would give a 25% profit. Therefore that can't be correct. So that suggests that perhaps the options have a mistake, but according to the problem's requirements, the correct answer is E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's profit is 20% of the marked price? Let me see. \n\nWait, if profit is 20% of the marked price, then:\n\nProfit = 0.2*M. \n\nSP = cost + profit \u2192 SP = 1200 +0.2*M. \n\nBut SP is also 0.8*M (because 20% discount). \n\nSo 0.8M =1200 +0.2M \u2192 0.6M =1200 \u2192 M = 2000. Not in options. \n\nHmm. So that's not matching any options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the profit is 20% of the selling price. Let's see that case again. \n\nIf profit is 20% of SP, then SP = cost / (1 - 0.2) \u2192 1200 /0.8 = 1500. So SP is 1500. \n\nThen M is 1500 /0.8 =1875. \n\nIn that case, the profit is 1500 -1200= 300. \n\n300 is 20% of 1500 (the SP), so that's correct. \n\nBut the problem says \"makes 20% profit\" without specifying. \n\nHmm. The problem is ambiguous. However, in standard accounting terms, profit percentage is usually on cost unless stated otherwise. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be E) 1800. \n\nBut looking at the options given, E is present. So why would the options have B as 1875? Perhaps the question is from a source where profit is considered on SP. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again. \n\nCost is 1200. Desired profit 20% on cost \u2192 SP = 1200 *1.2 =1440. \n\nDiscount is 20% on M \u2192 SP =0.8*M \u2192 M =1440 /0.8 = 1800. \n\nYes. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be E) 1800. \n\nWait, but the options include B as 1875. Maybe the question had a different percentage? Let me read the question again carefully. \n\n\"so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?\"\n\nYes, the numbers are 20% discount and 20% profit. \n\nHmm. So the correct answer is E. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E)1800. But the options have B)1875, which is what if the profit is on SP. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question's discount is on the selling price? No, that wouldn't make sense. \n\nWait, another way: Let me think of the problem as:\n\nLet the marked price be M. \n\nAfter 20% discount, the selling price is 0.8*M. \n\nThe cost is 1200. \n\nProfit is 20%, so selling price must be 1200 *1.2 =1440. \n\nThus, 0.8*M =1440 \u2192 M= 1800. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E. \n\nPerhaps the options are wrong, but given the options, E is correct. \n\nWait, the options given are A to E. The problem is presented correctly? Maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA)1,879\n\nB)1,875\n\nC)1,876\n\nD)1,872\n\nE)1,800\n\nYes. So E is there. So the answer should be E. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\n",

So that works. \n\nIf the marked price is 1875, then discount is 20% of 1875 = 375. Selling price is 1500. Profit is 300. 300/1200 is 25% profit. Wait, that's 25% profit on cost. So that would be a 25% profit, not 20. So that can't be. \n\nAh, so if the answer is B (1875), then that would give a 25% profit. Therefore that can't be correct.

Let's see that case again. \n\nIf profit is 20% of SP, then SP = cost / (1 - 0.2) \u2192 1200 /0.8 = 1500. So SP is 1500. \n\nThen M is 1500 /0.8 =1875. \n\nIn that case, the profit is 1500 -1200= 300. \n\n300 is 20% of 1500 (the SP), so that's correct. \n\nBut the problem says \"makes 20% profit\" without specifying. \n\nHmm. The problem is ambiguous. However, in standard accounting terms, profit percentage is usually on cost unless stated otherwise. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be E) 1800. \n\nBut looking at the options given, E is present. So why would the options have B as 1875? Perhaps the question is from a source where profit is considered on SP. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me check again. \n\nCost is 1200. Desired profit 20% on cost \u2192 SP = 1200 *1.2 =1440. \n\nDiscount is 20% on M \u2192 SP =0.8*M \u2192 M =1440 /0.8 = 1800. \n\nYes. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be E) 1800. \n\nWait, but the options include B as 1875. Maybe the question had a different percentage? Let me read the question again carefully. \n\n\"so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?\"\n\nYes, the numbers are 20% discount and 20% profit. \n\nHmm. So the correct answer is E. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E)1800. But the options have B)1875, which is what if the profit is on SP. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question's discount is on the selling price? No, that wouldn't make sense. \n\nWait, another way: Let me think of the problem as:\n\nLet the marked price be M. \n\nAfter 20% discount, the selling price is 0.8*M. \n\nThe cost is 1200. \n\nProfit is 20%, so selling price must be 1200 *1.2 =1440. \n\nThus, 0.8*M =1440 \u2192 M= 1800. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E. \n\nPerhaps the options are wrong, but given the options, E is correct. \n\nWait, the options given are A to E. The problem is presented correctly? Maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. \n\nThe options are:\n\nA)1,879\n\nB)1,875\n\nC)1,876\n\nD)1,872\n\nE)1,800\n\nYes. So E is there. So the answer should be E. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\n\n\nTo determine the marked price (M) for the sewing machine such that a 20% discount still yields a 20% profit on the cost price (Rs. 1200), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the desired selling price (SP) after a 20% profit on the cost:**\n   - Profit = 20% of cost = \\(0.20 \\times 1200 = 240\\).\n   - SP = Cost + Profit = \\(1200 + 240 = 1440\\).\n\n2. **Relate the selling price to the marked price after a 20% discount:**\n   - After a 20% discount, the customer pays 80% of the marked price: \\(0.80 \\times M = SP\\).\n   - Substitute SP = 1440 into the equation: \\(0.80 \\times M = 1440\\).\n\n3. **Solve for M:**\n   - \\(M = \\frac{1440}{0.80} = 1800\\).\n\nThe calculations confirm that the marked price should be **Rs. 1800**, which corresponds to option **E**. \n\nAnswer: E",
