      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem says that Raj was one-third as old as Rahim five years ago, and Raj is currently 17. I need to find Rahim's current age. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Raj's current age is 17. So five years ago, Raj would have been 17 minus 5, which is 12 years old. Right? So five years back, Raj was 12. \n\nThe problem states that at that time (five years ago), Raj's age was one-third of Rahim's age then. So, if Raj was 12, then Rahim's age back then must have been three times that. Let me write that down. \n\nLet me denote Rahim's age five years ago as R. According to the problem, Raj's age then (12) is equal to one-third of Rahim's age then. So the equation would be 12 = (1/3)*R. To find R, I can multiply both sides by 3. That gives R = 36. So Rahim was 36 years old five years ago. \n\nBut the question is asking for Rahim's current age. Since that was five years ago, I need to add 5 years to 36. 36 plus 5 equals 41. So Rahim is 41 now. Let me check the options. Option B is 41. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. So Raj is 17 now, five years ago 12. Rahim was three times that, so 36 then. Now, adding five, 41. Yeah, that seems right. The options given are A)37, B)41, C)40, D)42, E)43. So B is the correct answer. I think that's it. Let me just verify again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up variables properly. Let's try that to confirm. Let me let Rahim's current age be x. Five years ago, Rahim was x -5 years old. Raj's age then was 17 -5 =12. According to the problem, 12 = (1/3)(x -5). Solving for x: multiply both sides by 3 gives 36 = x -5, so x = 36 +5 =41. Yep, same result. Definitely B.\n",

The options are A)37, B)41, C)40, D)42, E)43. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the information given. The problem mentions Raj's current age and a relationship between their ages five years ago. Let me note down what I know.\n\nRaj's current age is 17. So five years ago, Raj would have been 17 - 5 = 12 years old. The problem states that at that time (five years back), Raj was one-third as old as Rahim. So, five years ago, Raj's age was 1/3 of Rahim's age then. \n\nWait, but Rahim's age five years ago is different from his current age. Let me denote Rahim's current age as R. Then, five years ago, Rahim would have been R - 5 years old. \n\nSo according to the problem, five years ago, Raj's age (which was 12) equals one-third of Rahim's age then (R - 5). So the equation should be:\n\n12 = (1/3) * (R - 5)\n\nTo solve for R, I can multiply both sides by 3. \n\n12 * 3 = R -5  \n36 = R -5  \nThen adding 5 to both sides: R = 41. \n\nWait, so Rahim's current age would be 41? Let me check the options. Option B is 41. So that's the answer?\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through again. \n\nRaj is 17 now. Five years ago, he was 12. At that time, he was one-third Rahim's age. So Rahim's age five years ago was three times 12, which is 36. So Rahim is now 36 +5 = 41. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I mixed up the ratio. Let me think: If Raj was one-third as old as Rahim, that means Rahim was three times as old as Raj at that time. So 3 * 12 = 36. So Rahim was 36 five years ago, so now he's 41. Yep. That's correct. \n\nSo the answer should be B)41. Let me check the options again. The options are A)37, B)41, C)40, D)42, E)43. So B is there. Okay, I think that's it. I don't see any errors in the calculations. So the correct answer is B.\n",
