      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. Hmm, let's see. The three friends are Alan, Roger, and Peter. The problem says that Alan is guessing randomly with a 1/5 chance. Roger is cheating by looking at someone else's paper, so his probability is 2/3. Peter is doing the calculations, so he has a 5/6 chance of being correct. \n\nThe question asks for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. Wait, so cheating here is specifically what Roger is doing. So, we need to consider the cases where either Alan or Peter answered correctly, but not Roger. Because if Roger is the one who got it right, that's considered cheating. But wait, the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\"\u2014does that mean that among all the correct answers, only those that were not obtained through cheating? Or is it the probability that at least one of them answered correctly without cheating?\n\nHmm, maybe I should read the problem again. The question is about the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. So perhaps it's the probability that at least one of them (Alan or Peter) got it right, and Roger didn't cheat? Or maybe that exactly one of them (either Alan or Peter) got it right, and Roger didn't? Or maybe it's the probability that at least one of the non-cheating methods (Alan and Peter) got it right, and Roger didn't? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So maybe it means that the correct answer was obtained without cheating. Since Roger cheated, if he got it right, that's cheating. So the desired outcome is that someone got it right, but that someone is either Alan (who is guessing) or Peter (who is working it out), and not Roger. Wait, but the question is phrased as \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So perhaps the correct answer was achieved through a non-cheating method, so it must be that either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Or is it that exactly one of the three got it right, and that one was non-cheating? Or maybe it's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct (regardless of who answered it) but the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, then the correct answer must have come from either Alan (who's guessing) or Peter (who's working it out). But how do we know which one answered it? Wait, maybe the question is considering the three friends each attempting the question, so the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, but not through cheating. So, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and not from Roger. So the correct answer is achieved by either Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't contribute the correct answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that person wasn't cheating. Wait, but the question isn't clear on whether it's the probability that the question was answered correctly by at least one of them, but not via cheating. So maybe the correct approach is to consider all the cases where at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, that's cheating, so we don't want that. So the total probability would be the probability that (Alan correct OR Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is that exactly one of the three answered correctly, and that person wasn't cheating. Hmm, but the problem states \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\"\u2014so perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer is achieved without cheating, meaning that the correct answer comes from either Alan or Peter, and not Roger. So in other words, the question is correct (so at least one of them is correct) but the method wasn't cheating. Since cheating only applies to Roger, the cheating case would be when Roger is the one who got it right. Therefore, the desired probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect, plus the cases where both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is incorrect? Wait, no, maybe it's the probability that the answer is correct (regardless of who) but the method wasn't cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, so any correct answer from Alan or Peter counts, but if Roger is correct, that's cheating, so we have to exclude any scenario where Roger's answer was correct.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is interpreted as the question being answered correctly (i.e., at least one of the three answered correctly) and the method wasn't cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, so the event is (correct answer) AND (Roger didn't answer correctly). Because if Roger answered correctly, then the answer was via cheating. So the probability would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, plus the case where both are correct, but Roger is incorrect. Wait, but that's exactly the same as (probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct) multiplied by the probability that Roger is incorrect? No, wait, they are independent?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to model the problem as each of them independently attempting the question. So each has their own probability of getting it right, and the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly (so at least one of them got it right) but that the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, that means that the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter, and not from Roger. But how do we compute that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the answer is correct but not via cheating. So the correct answer was achieved without cheating, which would mean that either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. So the events are:\n\n- Alan is correct OR Peter is correct, AND Roger is incorrect.\n\nSo the probability would be P((A \u2228 P) \u2227 \u00acR) = P(A \u2228 P) * P(\u00acR) ?\n\nWait, no, because A, P, and R are independent? Because each of them is attempting the question independently. So the probability that Alan is correct is independent of Roger's answer. So the events are independent.\n\nTherefore, the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct (or both) and Roger is incorrect is:\n\n[P(A \u2228 P)] * P(\u00acR)\n\nBecause the events are independent, the combined probability is the product.\n\nWait, but actually, A and P are independent of R, so the probability that (A or P) is correct and R is incorrect is indeed equal to [P(A or P)] * P(\u00acR).\n\nFirst, let me compute P(A or P). Since Alan and Peter are independent, the probability that at least one of them is correct is 1 - P(neither A nor P correct).\n\nSo P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - (1 - 1/5)*(1 - 5/6) \n\nLet me compute that. 1/5 is Alan's correct probability, so the probability he's wrong is 4/5. Peter's wrong probability is 1 - 5/6 = 1/6. So multiplying those gives 4/5 * 1/6 = 4/30 = 2/15. So 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nWait, so P(A or P) is 13/15. \n\nThen P(\u00acR) is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. \n\nTherefore, the total probability is (13/15) * (1/3) = 13/(45). Hmm, but looking at the options, option E is 13/45. Wait, but is that the correct approach?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Because the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly (so at least one of them is correct) and not via cheating. The cheating only applies to Roger's answer. So the \"not via cheating\" part would mean that Roger didn't answer correctly. So the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter, but not Roger. So the total event is (A \u2228 P \u2228 R) but with R being incorrect. Wait, no. Wait, the question is answered correctly, so at least one of them must be correct. But the method wasn't cheating, so Roger must not have contributed the correct answer. Therefore, the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. So the question is answered correctly (so at least one of them got it right) and Roger didn't get it right. \n\nWait, so the correct scenarios are those where (at least one of A or P is correct) AND R is incorrect. Because if R is incorrect, then even if he tried, he didn't contribute the correct answer. So the total probability is indeed P(A or P) * P(\u00acR). \n\nWait, but in that case, yes, the calculation would be 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/45, which is option E. Hmm. But let me check the options again. Option E is 13/45. But let me think if that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that person was not cheating. That would be different. Let me see. The wording is \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". The wording might mean that the answer was correct and the method wasn't cheating. So the method not cheating would mean that the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter. So the scenario is that the answer is correct (so someone got it right), but the correct answer was not obtained via cheating (i.e., Roger didn't get it right). So the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter, and the question is answered correctly. So the total probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. So that's exactly the calculation I did before.\n\nBut let me check the calculation again. \n\nFirst, P(A \u2228 P) = 1 - P(not A and not P). \n\nP(not A) = 4/5, P(not P) = 1/6. \n\nMultiply those: (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. \n\nSo 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nThen multiply by P(R is incorrect) which is 1/3. \n\nSo 13/15 * 1/3 = 13/(45). \n\nYes, that's 13/45, which is option E. \n\nWait, but another way to approach this is to compute all possibilities where the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, and Roger is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the cases where exactly one of A or P is correct and R is wrong, plus the case where both A and P are correct and R is wrong. \n\nLet me try that way. \n\nCase 1: Alan correct, Peter wrong, Roger wrong. \n\nProbability: (1/5)*(1/6)*(1/3) = (1/5)*(1/6)*(1/3) = 1/(90).\n\nCase 2: Peter correct, Alan wrong, Roger wrong. \n\nProbability: (4/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (4/5)*(5/6) is (20/30) = 2/3. Then times 1/3 gives 2/9. \n\nWait, 4/5 *5/6 is (4*5)/(5*6) = 4/6 = 2/3. So 2/3 *1/3 = 2/9. \n\nCase 3: Both Alan and Peter correct, Roger wrong. \n\nProbability: (1/5)*(5/6)*(1/3) = (1/5)*(5/6)=1/6, times 1/3 is 1/18. \n\nAdding all three cases: 1/90 + 2/9 + 1/18. \n\nConvert to common denominator of 90. \n\n1/90 + (2/9)*(10/10)=20/90, (1/18)*(5/5)=5/90. \n\nTotal is 1+20+5 =26/90? Wait, 26? Wait 1+20=21, plus 5 is 26? No, 1+20 is 21, plus 5 is 26? Wait no, 1+20=21, plus 5 is 26? Wait 21 +5 is 26? Wait 21 plus 5 is 26? Yes. So 26/90. \n\nWait, but that's 13/45, since 26 divided by 2 is 13, and 90 divided by 2 is 45. So that's 13/45. Which matches the previous result. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be E)13/45. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45. So yes, E is 13/45. \n\nHmm, so that seems right. \n\nAlternatively, could there be a different interpretation? Like maybe the question is asking for the probability that the answer was correct and none of them cheated. But cheating is only done by Roger. So if Roger didn't cheat, but that's not the case here. The problem says Roger cheated by looking. So his method is cheating, so any correct answer from him is via cheating. Therefore, the correct approach is as above. \n\nAnother way someone might get confused is by thinking that the question is answered by only one of them, but the problem states that all three are attempting it, so their answers are independent. The question is about the probability that the question was answered correctly (i.e., at least one got it right) but not via cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, the correct answers from Alan or Peter are acceptable. So the correct calculation is as done. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this probability question. Hmm, so the problem is about three friends\u2014Alan, Roger, and Peter\u2014each trying to answer a question on an exam. We need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. Oh right, cheating here probably refers to Roger's method since he's the one who cheated by looking at someone else's paper. \n\nFirst, let me parse the details again. Alan is guessing randomly with a 1/5 chance of being correct. Roger has a 2/3 chance because he cheated. Peter has a 5/6 chance by doing the calculations properly. The question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct but not through cheating. So that means we want the scenarios where either Alan or Peter got it right, but not Roger. Wait, no\u2014actually, maybe it's the probability that at least one of them got it right without cheating, but not considering Roger's cheating? Or perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating. Wait, maybe I need to read the question again more carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". Wait, so perhaps it's the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly, but none of them cheated. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because Alan and Peter aren't cheating. Wait, maybe it's the probability that the answer is correct, but not that the correct answer was obtained through cheating. So maybe it's the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly, but subtract the cases where Roger was the one who got it right (since his method is cheating). Or perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter (since Roger's method is cheating), so we want the probability that either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't?\n\nWait, maybe I need to think of it as the question is answered correctly by at least one of them, but the correct answer wasn't achieved through cheating. Since Roger's method is cheating, so if Roger got it right, that's cheating. So the event we want is that at least one of Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger did not. Because if Roger got it right, even if others did too, the correct answer was via cheating. Or does the question mean that the correct answer was achieved without any cheating? So perhaps the scenario where either Alan or Peter got it right, and Roger didn't. Because if Roger didn't cheat, then his method wouldn't be considered, but he's already cheating. Wait, maybe the problem is considering that \"answered correctly but not via cheating\" means that the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So the correct answer was achieved by Alan or Peter, and Roger either got it wrong or didn't cheat. Wait, but Roger's cheating is part of his method. So the problem is likely asking for the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger didn't cheat (but actually, since Roger is cheating, his cheating is part of his method). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that the correct one was not Roger. Or maybe the probability that the answer is correct (regardless of who did it) but that the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. Wait, perhaps the key is that the answer is correct, and the correct answer wasn't obtained via cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, so the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter. So the question is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was via cheating. But maybe even if Roger is correct and someone else is also correct, the presence of cheating means that the correct answer is via cheating? Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me re-read the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So the correct answer must have been achieved without cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, so the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter. But since the friends are all attempting the question, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that at least one of them answered correctly, and that all correct answers were from non-cheaters (i.e., Alan or Peter). So in other words, the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right. Because if Roger got it right, then the correct answer was obtained via cheating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the question is considered answered correctly by at least one of them, but the method used was not cheating. Since Roger's method is cheating, but the others aren't. So the probability that the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So the correct answer must have been obtained by Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer doesn't matter except that if he got it right, that's cheating. Wait, perhaps the problem is phrased such that the \"answer\" being correct but not via cheating. So maybe the question is looking for the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly, but the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So that would mean that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then that's cheating, so the correct answer was via cheating. So the desired event is (Alan correct or Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that person was not cheating. But the wording doesn't specify exactly one. The question is just the probability that the question is answered correctly (by at least one of them?), but not via cheating. Wait, perhaps the question is about each of them answering the question, and the question being answered correctly but not via cheating. Maybe the question is referring to the answer being correct and the method not involving cheating. Since each of them has their own method, so the question is answered correctly by one of them, and that person didn't cheat. \n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let's think of the possible interpretations. \n\nFirst interpretation: The question is answered correctly by at least one of the three, but none of the correct answers were obtained through cheating. That would require that any correct answer is from Alan or Peter, and Roger did not get it right. Because if Roger got it right, that's cheating. So the event is (Alan or Peter correct) AND (Roger incorrect). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone, and that the method used was not cheating. So the answer is correct, and the person who got it right didn't cheat. Since only Roger cheated, so the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and they got it right. \n\nWait, the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So maybe it's the probability that the answer is correct, and that the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. Since the cheating is Roger's method, so if the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, then it's not via cheating. So the total correct answers from non-cheaters (Alan and Peter) plus any cases where Roger is wrong but others are correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger. Because if either of them is correct, then there's a correct answer not via cheating. But if Roger is also correct, then even though he cheated, the existence of a correct answer not via cheating (from Alan or Peter) would still satisfy the condition. Wait, but the wording is \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". Maybe it's the probability that the answer is correct and that the method used wasn't cheating. Since the question is about the method, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer was obtained without cheating. So, the person who answered correctly must have used a non-cheating method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, and the method was not cheating. Since each of them has their own method. So the total probability would be the probability that Alan answered correctly (since he didn't cheat) plus the probability that Peter answered correctly (he didn't cheat) but subtract the case where both answered correctly, because that's overlapping. Wait, but that might not account for Roger. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it step by step.\n\nThe problem says: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". The key here is to parse what exactly constitutes the event. Since the three friends are all attempting the question, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that at least one of them answered correctly using a method that is not cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, so the non-cheating methods are Alan's and Peter's. \n\nSo the desired probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly. Because if either of them got it right, then there's a correct answer via non-cheating. However, we must also consider that even if Roger also got it right (cheating), the presence of Alan or Peter's correct answer would still mean that the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating. So in that case, the event is satisfied. Wait, but the problem says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". Maybe it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, meaning that at least one non-cheater (Alan or Peter) got it right, regardless of Roger's answer. Because even if Roger cheated and got it right, the fact that someone else (non-cheater) also got it right would mean that the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating. Or perhaps the question is phrased such that the \"answer\" (the question's answer) is correct, but the method used to get it wasn't cheating. Since all three are attempting, perhaps the question is considering that the answer being correct is via one of them, and we need the probability that whichever method produced the correct answer was not cheating. But that's more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simpler: it's the probability that at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan and Peter) answered correctly. Because that way, the question has a correct answer without cheating. The presence of Roger's cheating answer doesn't negate that. So the probability that either Alan or Peter (or both) got it right. Because even if Roger also got it right, the fact that the question was answered correctly via non-cheating methods is still true. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's consider all possibilities. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. The wording could be interpreted as: the answer is correct, and the method used to get the answer was not cheating. Since each of the three has their own method, perhaps the question is referring to the answer being correct, and the method used by the person who got it right wasn't cheating. But since there are three people, maybe it's the probability that at least one of them answered correctly using a non-cheating method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that exactly one of them answered, but that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone who didn't cheat. So the correct answer must have been provided by Alan or Peter. So the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. Because if either is correct, then the question was answered correctly without cheating. Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if he also got it right, but since the question is answered correctly via non-cheating (since Alan or Peter also did), then it still counts. \n\nIn that case, the probability would be the probability that Alan is correct OR Peter is correct. Since those are independent events. \n\nWait, but Alan and Peter's answers are independent? Yes, I assume each of them works independently. \n\nSo, the probability that Alan or Peter is correct is 1 - probability both are incorrect. \n\nAlan's probability of being incorrect is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. \n\nPeter's probability of being incorrect is 1 - 5/6 = 1/6. \n\nSo the probability both are incorrect is (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. \n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of them is correct is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the options don't have that. Hmm. Wait, but the options given are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45. None of these are 13/15. So that suggests my approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so maybe my initial interpretation is incorrect. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, but not via cheating. So that means that the correct answer was not obtained by cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, so the correct answer must have been obtained by Alan or Peter. So the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, and that the person who got it right didn't cheat. \n\nWait, but there are three people. So perhaps the question is considering that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one didn't cheat. Or maybe the question is that the correct answer was achieved without any cheating. But that's a bit unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by at least one of the three, but the correct answer was not obtained via cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, that would require that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was via cheating, so the \"but not via cheating\" would exclude that. \n\nAh, that might make more sense. Let me see. \n\nSo the event is: the question is answered correctly (so at least one of the three is correct) AND the correct answer was not obtained via cheating. Since cheating is Roger's method, so the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have gotten it right. Because if Roger did get it right, then that's cheating, so the correct answer was via cheating, which we want to exclude. \n\nWait, but if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is also correct, then the correct answer was obtained via cheating (because Roger's method is cheating). So the scenario where the correct answer is achieved without cheating would require that Roger is incorrect, but at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nTherefore, the desired probability is (probability that Roger is incorrect) * (probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct). \n\nBecause if Roger is incorrect, then his cheating doesn't contribute to the correct answer, so the only correct answers (if any) come from Alan or Peter. \n\nSo let's compute that. \n\nFirst, probability that Roger is incorrect is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. \n\nProbability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct is 1 - (probability both incorrect). \n\nAlan's incorrect is 4/5, Peter's incorrect is 1/6. So both incorrect: (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. \n\nThus, probability at least one correct among Alan and Peter is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nTherefore, the combined probability is (1/3)*(13/15) = 13/45. \n\nHmm, that's option E. \n\nWait but let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants the probability that the question was answered correctly (by someone) and that the method wasn't cheating. So that would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is either correct or incorrect, but the existence of their correct answer means that the correct answer wasn't via cheating. Wait, but that would include cases where Roger also got it right, but as long as Alan or Peter did too, then the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating. \n\nWait, but the wording says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". If the answer was obtained via cheating (Roger's method), but someone else also got it right, then does that count? The problem says \"but not via cheating\", so perhaps even if the correct answer was obtained via cheating, but also via non-cheating, does it still count as \"not via cheating\"? \n\nHmm, that's a good point. Maybe the problem requires that the correct answer was obtained without any cheating. So that would require that the correct answer was only obtained via non-cheating methods. So if Roger got it right (cheating), even if others did too, then the correct answer was obtained via cheating, so that scenario is excluded. \n\nTherefore, the only acceptable scenarios are those where at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because that way, the correct answer(s) are via non-cheating. \n\nSo that brings us back to the calculation (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45, which is option E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the question is answered correctly by someone, and that the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So the existence of a correct answer via non-cheating suffices, even if another person cheated. \n\nIn that case, the probability would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. Because even if Roger cheated and got it right, as long as someone else did it without cheating, the correct answer was obtained via non-cheating. \n\nIn that case, the probability would be the probability that Alan or Peter is correct, which is 13/15, but that's not an option. \n\nHmm, so that suggests that my first approach was wrong, and the correct interpretation must be the first scenario. \n\nWait, let's check the options again. The options include E)13/45. Let me see:\n\nIf the desired probability is (prob Roger incorrect) * (prob at least one of Alan or Peter correct), then that is (1/3)*(13/15) = 13/(3*15) = 13/45, which is option E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly (by at least one) and that none of the correct answers were obtained via cheating. \n\nIn that case, the scenario requires that any correct answers are from Alan or Peter, and Roger must have gotten it wrong. So the total correct answers come only from non-cheaters, and Roger is wrong. \n\nYes, that would be the same calculation as above. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be E)13/45. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of all possibilities. \n\nThe question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So the correct answer must have been obtained by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't contribute via cheating. So the scenarios are:\n\nEither Alan is correct and Roger is wrong, and Peter can be anything (but if Peter is also correct, that's okay). Or Peter is correct and Roger is wrong, Alan can be anything. Or both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the total probability is the probability that Roger is wrong multiplied by the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nYes, that's exactly the same as (1/3)*(13/15)=13/45. \n\nSo that's option E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recalculate:\n\nProbability that Roger is incorrect is 1/3. \n\nProbability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct is 1 - (4/5 * 1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 = 13/15. \n\nSo 1/3 * 13/15 = (13)/(45) \u2192 yes, that's 13/45. \n\nSo the answer must be E. \n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, which would mean that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if he got it right, then the cheating path exists. So to ensure that the correct answer was not via cheating, the correct answer must not have come from Roger. \n\nSo the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct AND Roger is incorrect. \n\nYes, that's exactly the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, if Roger is correct, then even if others are correct, the presence of cheating means that the answer was obtained via cheating. So the only acceptable cases are when Roger is wrong, and at least one of the other two are correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E)13/45. \n\nSo the options are given, and E is 13/45. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me see if there's another way. \n\nSuppose the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that person didn't cheat. \n\nThen the probability would be: \n\nProbability Alan correct and others wrong: (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 -5/6) \n\nPlus probability Peter correct and others wrong: (5/6)*(1 - 2/3)*(4/5). \n\nPlus the case where both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is wrong. \n\nWait, but that would be more complicated. \n\nWait, but the question says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". If multiple people answered correctly, as long as at least one non-cheater did, then the answer was obtained without cheating. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct and that the method was not cheating. Since each of the three has their own method, perhaps the question wants the probability that a correct answer was given using a non-cheating method. \n\nIn that case, it would be the probability that Alan is correct (since he used a non-cheating method) plus the probability that Peter is correct (non-cheating) minus the probability that both are correct (since they overlap). \n\nBecause if both are correct, we don't want to double count. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So maybe it's the probability that at least one non-cheater got it right. \n\nSo the total probability would be the probability that Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger. \n\nBut that would be 1 - (prob both Alan and Peter incorrect). \n\nWhich is 1 - (4/5 * 1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 = 13/15. \n\nBut that's not among the options, so that can't be right. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone who didn't cheat. So the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not Roger. \n\nWait, but that's different. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct and that the person who answered it didn't cheat. Since there are three people, perhaps the question is considering that one of them answered, and the answer was correct and not via cheating. \n\nWait, but the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". Maybe it's the probability that the correct answer was provided by someone who didn't cheat. \n\nSo, the probability that Alan answered correctly (1/5) plus the probability that Peter answered correctly (5/6) minus the probability that both answered correctly (because we don't want to double count) plus the cases where only one of them is correct. \n\nWait, but that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nBut again, that gives 13/15, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial interpretation was correct, and the answer is E. \n\nAlternatively, let me see the options again. Let me see the options:\n\nA)1/18 \u22480.055\n\nB)1/9 \u22480.111\n\nC)23/90\u22480.255\n\nD)5/18\u22480.277\n\nE)13/45\u22480.288\n\nHmm, so 13/45 is approximately 0.288, which is one of the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the three friends each have an independent chance, and the question is answered correctly if at least one of them got it right, but the method wasn't cheating. Wait, but that's ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved without any cheating. So that would require that Roger did not cheat and answer correctly. Wait, but Roger is cheating regardless. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone who didn't cheat, and that no cheating occurred. Since Roger is cheating, so the only way for no cheating to have occurred is if Roger didn't cheat, but the problem states that Roger cheated. Wait, that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter (non-cheaters), and that Roger did not answer correctly. So the correct answer comes from the non-cheaters, and Roger didn't contribute a correct answer. \n\nThus, the calculation is (Probability Roger wrong) multiplied by (Probability at least one of Alan or Peter is correct). \n\nWhich is (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45 \u2192 E. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E. \n\nWait, but let me think of another approach. Let me consider all possible scenarios where the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. \n\nThe correct answer must have been obtained by Alan or Peter. So the scenarios are: \n\n1. Alan correct, Peter correct, Roger wrong \u2192 valid \n\n2. Alan correct, Peter wrong, Roger wrong \u2192 valid \n\n3. Alan wrong, Peter correct, Roger wrong \u2192 valid \n\n4. Any scenario where Roger is correct would be excluded because it's via cheating. \n\nAdditionally, even if Roger is wrong but others are also correct, that's okay. \n\nThus, the total probability is the probability that Roger is wrong multiplied by the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nWhich again gives 1/3 * (1 - (4/5 * 1/6)) \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo that's 13/45. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we need to consider the scenarios where the correct answer is obtained by Alan or Peter (non-cheaters) and exclude any cases where Roger (the cheater) answered correctly. \n\n1. **Probability Roger is incorrect**:  \n   Roger's probability of being incorrect is \\(1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Probability at least one of Alan or Peter is correct**:  \n   The probability that both Alan and Peter are incorrect is:  \n   \\[\n   \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{6}\\right) = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15}.\n   \\]  \n   Therefore, the probability that at least one of them is correct is:  \n   \\[\n   1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combined probability**:  \n   Multiply the probabilities of Roger being incorrect and at least one of Alan or Peter being correct:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{13}{15} = \\frac{13}{45}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is \\(\\frac{13}{45}\\).\n\nAnswer: E",

So the correct answer must have been achieved without cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, so the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter. But since the friends are all attempting the question, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that at least one of them answered correctly, and that all correct answers were from non-cheaters (i.e., Alan or Peter). So in other words, the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't get it right. Because if Roger got it right, then the correct answer was obtained via cheating. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the question is considered answered correctly by at least one of them, but the method used was not cheating. Since Roger's method is cheating, but the others aren't. So the probability that the correct answer was achieved by someone who didn't cheat. So the correct answer must have been obtained by Alan or Peter, and Roger's answer doesn't matter except that if he got it right, that's cheating. Wait, perhaps the problem is phrased such that the \"answer\" being correct but not via cheating. So maybe the question is looking for the probability that at least one of the three answered correctly, but the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So that would mean that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then that's cheating, so the correct answer was via cheating. So the desired event is (Alan correct or Peter correct) AND Roger incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that person was not cheating. But the wording doesn't specify exactly one. The question is just the probability that the question is answered correctly (by at least one of them?), but not via cheating. Wait, perhaps the question is about each of them answering the question, and the question being answered correctly but not via cheating. Maybe the question is referring to the answer being correct and the method not involving cheating. Since each of them has their own method, so the question is answered correctly by one of them, and that person didn't cheat. \n\nHmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Let's think of the possible interpretations. \n\nFirst interpretation: The question is answered correctly by at least one of the three, but none of the correct answers were obtained through cheating. That would require that any correct answer is from Alan or Peter, and Roger did not get it right. Because if Roger got it right, that's cheating. So the event is (Alan or Peter correct) AND (Roger incorrect). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone, and that the method used was not cheating. So the answer is correct, and the person who got it right didn't cheat. Since only Roger cheated, so the correct answer must be from Alan or Peter, and they got it right. \n\nWait, the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So maybe it's the probability that the answer is correct, and that the correct answer was not obtained through cheating. Since the cheating is Roger's method, so if the correct answer is from Alan or Peter, then it's not via cheating. So the total correct answers from non-cheaters (Alan and Peter) plus any cases where Roger is wrong but others are correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger. Because if either of them is correct, then there's a correct answer not via cheating. But if Roger is also correct, then even though he cheated, the existence of a correct answer not via cheating (from Alan or Peter) would still satisfy the condition. Wait, but the wording is \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". Maybe it's the probability that the answer is correct and that the method used wasn't cheating. Since the question is about the method, perhaps it's the probability that the correct answer was obtained without cheating. So, the person who answered correctly must have used a non-cheating method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, and the method was not cheating. Since each of them has their own method. So the total probability would be the probability that Alan answered correctly (since he didn't cheat) plus the probability that Peter answered correctly (he didn't cheat) but subtract the case where both answered correctly, because that's overlapping. Wait, but that might not account for Roger. \n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me try to structure it step by step.\n\nThe problem says: \"the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". The key here is to parse what exactly constitutes the event. Since the three friends are all attempting the question, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that at least one of them answered correctly using a method that is not cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, so the non-cheating methods are Alan's and Peter's. \n\nSo the desired probability is the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly. Because if either of them got it right, then there's a correct answer via non-cheating. However, we must also consider that even if Roger also got it right (cheating), the presence of Alan or Peter's correct answer would still mean that the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating. So in that case, the event is satisfied. Wait, but the problem says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". Maybe it's the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, meaning that at least one non-cheater (Alan or Peter) got it right, regardless of Roger's answer. Because even if Roger cheated and got it right, the fact that someone else (non-cheater) also got it right would mean that the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating. Or perhaps the question is phrased such that the \"answer\" (the question's answer) is correct, but the method used to get it wasn't cheating. Since all three are attempting, perhaps the question is considering that the answer being correct is via one of them, and we need the probability that whichever method produced the correct answer was not cheating. But that's more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simpler: it's the probability that at least one of the non-cheaters (Alan and Peter) answered correctly. Because that way, the question has a correct answer without cheating. The presence of Roger's cheating answer doesn't negate that. So the probability that either Alan or Peter (or both) got it right. Because even if Roger also got it right, the fact that the question was answered correctly via non-cheating methods is still true. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Let's consider all possibilities. The question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. The wording could be interpreted as: the answer is correct, and the method used to get the answer was not cheating. Since each of the three has their own method, perhaps the question is referring to the answer being correct, and the method used by the person who got it right wasn't cheating. But since there are three people, maybe it's the probability that at least one of them answered correctly using a non-cheating method. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering that exactly one of them answered, but that seems unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone who didn't cheat. So the correct answer must have been provided by Alan or Peter. So the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. Because if either is correct, then the question was answered correctly without cheating. Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if he also got it right, but since the question is answered correctly via non-cheating (since Alan or Peter also did), then it still counts. \n\nIn that case, the probability would be the probability that Alan is correct OR Peter is correct. Since those are independent events. \n\nWait, but Alan and Peter's answers are independent? Yes, I assume each of them works independently. \n\nSo, the probability that Alan or Peter is correct is 1 - probability both are incorrect. \n\nAlan's probability of being incorrect is 1 - 1/5 = 4/5. \n\nPeter's probability of being incorrect is 1 - 5/6 = 1/6. \n\nSo the probability both are incorrect is (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. \n\nTherefore, the probability that at least one of them is correct is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nWait, but that can't be right because the options don't have that. Hmm. Wait, but the options given are A)1/18, B)1/9, C)23/90, D)5/18, E)13/45. None of these are 13/15. So that suggests my approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, so maybe my initial interpretation is incorrect. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, but not via cheating. So that means that the correct answer was not obtained by cheating. Since cheating is only done by Roger, so the correct answer must have been obtained by Alan or Peter. So the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct, and that the person who got it right didn't cheat. \n\nWait, but there are three people. So perhaps the question is considering that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that one didn't cheat. Or maybe the question is that the correct answer was achieved without any cheating. But that's a bit unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by at least one of the three, but the correct answer was not obtained via cheating. Since cheating is only Roger's method, that would require that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because if Roger is correct, then the correct answer was via cheating, so the \"but not via cheating\" would exclude that. \n\nAh, that might make more sense. Let me see. \n\nSo the event is: the question is answered correctly (so at least one of the three is correct) AND the correct answer was not obtained via cheating. Since cheating is Roger's method, so the correct answer must have come from Alan or Peter, and Roger must not have gotten it right. Because if Roger did get it right, then that's cheating, so the correct answer was via cheating, which we want to exclude. \n\nWait, but if both Alan and Peter are correct, and Roger is also correct, then the correct answer was obtained via cheating (because Roger's method is cheating). So the scenario where the correct answer is achieved without cheating would require that Roger is incorrect, but at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nTherefore, the desired probability is (probability that Roger is incorrect) * (probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct). \n\nBecause if Roger is incorrect, then his cheating doesn't contribute to the correct answer, so the only correct answers (if any) come from Alan or Peter. \n\nSo let's compute that. \n\nFirst, probability that Roger is incorrect is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. \n\nProbability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct is 1 - (probability both incorrect). \n\nAlan's incorrect is 4/5, Peter's incorrect is 1/6. So both incorrect: (4/5)*(1/6) = 4/30 = 2/15. \n\nThus, probability at least one correct among Alan and Peter is 1 - 2/15 = 13/15. \n\nTherefore, the combined probability is (1/3)*(13/15) = 13/45. \n\nHmm, that's option E. \n\nWait but let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants the probability that the question was answered correctly (by someone) and that the method wasn't cheating. So that would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is either correct or incorrect, but the existence of their correct answer means that the correct answer wasn't via cheating. Wait, but that would include cases where Roger also got it right, but as long as Alan or Peter did too, then the correct answer was achieved via non-cheating. \n\nWait, but the wording says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". If the answer was obtained via cheating (Roger's method), but someone else also got it right, then does that count? The problem says \"but not via cheating\", so perhaps even if the correct answer was obtained via cheating, but also via non-cheating, does it still count as \"not via cheating\"? \n\nHmm, that's a good point. Maybe the problem requires that the correct answer was obtained without any cheating. So that would require that the correct answer was only obtained via non-cheating methods. So if Roger got it right (cheating), even if others did too, then the correct answer was obtained via cheating, so that scenario is excluded. \n\nTherefore, the only acceptable scenarios are those where at least one of Alan or Peter is correct, and Roger is incorrect. Because that way, the correct answer(s) are via non-cheating. \n\nSo that brings us back to the calculation (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45, which is option E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the question is answered correctly by someone, and that the correct answer wasn't obtained through cheating. So the existence of a correct answer via non-cheating suffices, even if another person cheated. \n\nIn that case, the probability would be the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. Because even if Roger cheated and got it right, as long as someone else did it without cheating, the correct answer was obtained via non-cheating. \n\nIn that case, the probability would be the probability that Alan or Peter is correct, which is 13/15, but that's not an option. \n\nHmm, so that suggests that my first approach was wrong, and the correct interpretation must be the first scenario. \n\nWait, let's check the options again. The options include E)13/45. Let me see:\n\nIf the desired probability is (prob Roger incorrect) * (prob at least one of Alan or Peter correct), then that is (1/3)*(13/15) = 13/(3*15) = 13/45, which is option E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly (by at least one) and that none of the correct answers were obtained via cheating. \n\nIn that case, the scenario requires that any correct answers are from Alan or Peter, and Roger must have gotten it wrong. So the total correct answers come only from non-cheaters, and Roger is wrong. \n\nYes, that would be the same calculation as above. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be E)13/45. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of all possibilities. \n\nThe question is answered correctly but not via cheating. So the correct answer must have been obtained by Alan or Peter, and Roger didn't contribute via cheating. So the scenarios are:\n\nEither Alan is correct and Roger is wrong, and Peter can be anything (but if Peter is also correct, that's okay). Or Peter is correct and Roger is wrong, Alan can be anything. Or both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the total probability is the probability that Roger is wrong multiplied by the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nYes, that's exactly the same as (1/3)*(13/15)=13/45. \n\nSo that's option E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recalculate:\n\nProbability that Roger is incorrect is 1/3. \n\nProbability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct is 1 - (4/5 * 1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 = 13/15. \n\nSo 1/3 * 13/15 = (13)/(45) \u2192 yes, that's 13/45. \n\nSo the answer must be E. \n\nWait, but let me check another angle. Suppose the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer was achieved without cheating, which would mean that at least one of Alan or Peter answered correctly, and Roger's answer is irrelevant except that if he got it right, then the cheating path exists. So to ensure that the correct answer was not via cheating, the correct answer must not have come from Roger. \n\nSo the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct AND Roger is incorrect. \n\nYes, that's exactly the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, if Roger is correct, then even if others are correct, the presence of cheating means that the answer was obtained via cheating. So the only acceptable cases are when Roger is wrong, and at least one of the other two are correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is E)13/45. \n\nSo the options are given, and E is 13/45. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me see if there's another way. \n\nSuppose the question is asking for the probability that exactly one of them answered correctly, and that person didn't cheat. \n\nThen the probability would be: \n\nProbability Alan correct and others wrong: (1/5) * (1 - 2/3) * (1 -5/6) \n\nPlus probability Peter correct and others wrong: (5/6)*(1 - 2/3)*(4/5). \n\nPlus the case where both Alan and Peter are correct and Roger is wrong. \n\nWait, but that would be more complicated. \n\nWait, but the question says \"answered correctly, but not via cheating\". If multiple people answered correctly, as long as at least one non-cheater did, then the answer was obtained without cheating. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct and that the method was not cheating. Since each of the three has their own method, perhaps the question wants the probability that a correct answer was given using a non-cheating method. \n\nIn that case, it would be the probability that Alan is correct (since he used a non-cheating method) plus the probability that Peter is correct (non-cheating) minus the probability that both are correct (since they overlap). \n\nBecause if both are correct, we don't want to double count. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". So maybe it's the probability that at least one non-cheater got it right. \n\nSo the total probability would be the probability that Alan or Peter is correct, regardless of Roger. \n\nBut that would be 1 - (prob both Alan and Peter incorrect). \n\nWhich is 1 - (4/5 * 1/6) = 1 - (4/30) = 26/30 = 13/15. \n\nBut that's not among the options, so that can't be right. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question was answered correctly by someone who didn't cheat. So the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct, but not Roger. \n\nWait, but that's different. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the answer is correct and that the person who answered it didn't cheat. Since there are three people, perhaps the question is considering that one of them answered, and the answer was correct and not via cheating. \n\nWait, but the question says \"the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating\". Maybe it's the probability that the correct answer was provided by someone who didn't cheat. \n\nSo, the probability that Alan answered correctly (1/5) plus the probability that Peter answered correctly (5/6) minus the probability that both answered correctly (because we don't want to double count) plus the cases where only one of them is correct. \n\nWait, but that would be the probability that either Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nBut again, that gives 13/15, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm, so perhaps my initial interpretation was correct, and the answer is E. \n\nAlternatively, let me see the options again. Let me see the options:\n\nA)1/18 \u22480.055\n\nB)1/9 \u22480.111\n\nC)23/90\u22480.255\n\nD)5/18\u22480.277\n\nE)13/45\u22480.288\n\nHmm, so 13/45 is approximately 0.288, which is one of the options. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the three friends each have an independent chance, and the question is answered correctly if at least one of them got it right, but the method wasn't cheating. Wait, but that's ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the correct answer is achieved without any cheating. So that would require that Roger did not cheat and answer correctly. Wait, but Roger is cheating regardless. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by someone who didn't cheat, and that no cheating occurred. Since Roger is cheating, so the only way for no cheating to have occurred is if Roger didn't cheat, but the problem states that Roger cheated. Wait, that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the probability that the question is answered correctly by Alan or Peter (non-cheaters), and that Roger did not answer correctly. So the correct answer comes from the non-cheaters, and Roger didn't contribute a correct answer. \n\nThus, the calculation is (Probability Roger wrong) multiplied by (Probability at least one of Alan or Peter is correct). \n\nWhich is (1/3) * (13/15) = 13/45 \u2192 E. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E. \n\nWait, but let me think of another approach. Let me consider all possible scenarios where the question is answered correctly but not via cheating. \n\nThe correct answer must have been obtained by Alan or Peter. So the scenarios are: \n\n1. Alan correct, Peter correct, Roger wrong \u2192 valid \n\n2. Alan correct, Peter wrong, Roger wrong \u2192 valid \n\n3. Alan wrong, Peter correct, Roger wrong \u2192 valid \n\n4. Any scenario where Roger is correct would be excluded because it's via cheating. \n\nAdditionally, even if Roger is wrong but others are also correct, that's okay. \n\nThus, the total probability is the probability that Roger is wrong multiplied by the probability that at least one of Alan or Peter is correct. \n\nWhich again gives 1/3 * (1 - (4/5 * 1/6)) \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo that's 13/45. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is E.\n\n\nTo determine the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating, we need to consider the scenarios where the correct answer is obtained by Alan or Peter (non-cheaters) and exclude any cases where Roger (the cheater) answered correctly. \n\n1. **Probability Roger is incorrect**:  \n   Roger's probability of being incorrect is \\(1 - \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\n2. **Probability at least one of Alan or Peter is correct**:  \n   The probability that both Alan and Peter are incorrect is:  \n   \\[\n   \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{5}\\right) \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{5}{6}\\right) = \\frac{4}{5} \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{30} = \\frac{2}{15}.\n   \\]  \n   Therefore, the probability that at least one of them is correct is:  \n   \\[\n   1 - \\frac{2}{15} = \\frac{13}{15}.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Combined probability**:  \n   Multiply the probabilities of Roger being incorrect and at least one of Alan or Peter being correct:  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{13}{15} = \\frac{13}{45}.\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is \\(\\frac{13}{45}\\).\n\nAnswer: E",
