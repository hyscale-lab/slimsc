      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about ratios in a cereal mixture. The ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5. And we're told that a bag has 3 pounds of rice. We need to find out how much corn is in that bag. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but I think I can handle this.\n\nFirst, ratios tell us the relative amounts of each component. So the ratio 2:3:5 means that for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts wheat and 5 parts corn. The total parts would be 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 parts. But maybe I don't need the total here. Let me think.\n\nSince the ratio of rice to corn is 2:5, that's probably the key part here. Because we know the amount of rice and need to find corn. So, the ratio of rice to corn is 2:5, which can be written as 2/5. That means for every 2 units of rice, there are 5 units of corn. \n\nThe given amount of rice is 3 pounds. Let me set up a proportion here. Let\u2019s say the amount of corn is x. Then the ratio of rice to corn should be the same as 2:5. So:\n\n2 / 5 = 3 / x\n\nWait, cross-multiplying that would give 2x = 15, so x would be 7.5? That would be 7.5 pounds of corn. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the ratio units. The ratio of rice is 2 parts, and in the actual mixture, that's 3 pounds. So each part must be 3 divided by 2, which is 1.5 pounds per part. Then corn is 5 parts, so 5 times 1.5 equals 7.5. Yeah, that's the same answer. So that would be option B)7.5. Let me see the options again. The options are A)6.5, B)7.5, C)7, D)6, E)None. So B is an option. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through another way. The total ratio parts are 2+3+5=10. But maybe the problem is not asking for total, but just the corn. Since rice is 2 parts equals 3 pounds, each part is 1.5. So corn is 5 parts, so 5 *1.5 is indeed 7.5. That's correct. So the answer should be B. So the answer is B)7.5. \n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I misread the ratio. Let me check again. The ratio is rice:wheat:corn =2:3:5. Yes, so rice is 2 parts. So yes, that part is right. So I think the answer is B. The options given include B as 7.5, so that's correct. I don't see any mistakes here. So the answer must be B.\n",

I think I can set up a proportion here. Let me write that down.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the amount of corn as x. The ratio of rice to corn is 2:5, so 2/5 = 3/x. Wait, is that right? Because the ratio is parts rice to parts corn. So if 2 parts rice corresponds to 3 pounds, then each part is 3 divided by 2. Then corn, which is 5 parts, would be 5 times that part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of equivalent ratios. The original ratio is 2:3:5. The actual rice is 3 pounds. So the ratio's rice part (2) is scaled up by some factor to get to 3. Let me think of the scaling factor. \n\nLet\u2019s say the ratio parts are multiplied by a number 'k' to get the actual amounts. So rice is 2k = 3 pounds. Solving for k: k = 3/2 = 1.5. Then corn is 5k, so 5*(3/2) = 15/2 which is 7.5 pounds. Oh, so that would be option B)7.5. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me re-express the problem. The ratio is rice:wheat:corn = 2:3:5. The total parts are 10, but since we are given the rice amount, maybe I don't need the total. The key is that each part is equal. So 2 parts correspond to rice which is 3 pounds.

Like, maybe someone might think total parts and then find the corn? Let me see. The total parts are 10. If rice is 2 parts, then 2 parts =3, so total mixture would be 10 parts = 15 pounds. Then corn is 5 parts, which is half of the total? Wait, 5 parts out of 10 would be half, so 15 * 0.5 =7.5. Same answer. So that's consistent. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is B)7.5. But wait, maybe I made an error in the ratio? Let me check once more. The ratio is 2:3:5 for rice:wheat:corn. So rice is 2 parts. If 2 parts =3, then each part is 1.5. Corn is 5 parts: 5*1.5 is indeed 7.5. So yeah, that's right. So the answer must be B. The options have B as 7.5. So I think that's the correct choice. None of the other options make sense.
