      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so here's this problem: The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat increases by 1.8 kg when one of them, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man. We need to find the new man's weight. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that average is total divided by the number of people. So, the original average weight must have been the total weight of the 10 oarsmen divided by 10. Then, when they replace one guy, the average goes up by 1.8. \n\nLet me denote the original total weight as T. So the original average is T/10. After replacing the 53 kg guy with the new man, the new total weight becomes T - 53 + x, where x is the new man's weight. The new average would then be (T -53 +x)/10. \n\nThe problem says that this new average is 1.8 kg higher than the original average. So, the equation would be:\n\n(T -53 + x)/10 = (T/10) + 1.8\n\nHmm, let me write that down properly. Let me rearrange this equation to solve for x.\n\nMultiply both sides by 10 to eliminate denominators:\n\nT -53 + x = T + 18\n\nWait, because 1.8 multiplied by 10 is 18. Right. \n\nSo subtract T from both sides: -53 +x = 18 \n\nThen, solving for x: x = 18 +53 = 71. \n\nWait, that would be 71 kg. So the answer would be option A?\n\nWait a second, let me double-check. Let me think again. \n\nOriginal average is T/10. The new average is (T -53 +x)/10. The difference between the new and old average is 1.8. So:\n\n[(T -53 +x)/10] - [T/10] = 1.8\n\nWhich simplifies to ( (T -53 +x - T)/10 ) = 1.8 \n\nThat's (x -53)/10 = 1.8 \n\nMultiply both sides by 10: x -53 = 18 \n\nThen x = 53 +18 =71. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the new man's weight is 71 kg. So option A is the answer. \n\nBut wait, the options given are A)71, B)62, etc. So that's matching. Hmm, but I need to make sure I didn't make any mistake here. Let me think of another way. \n\nSuppose the original total weight is T. The new total is T -53 + x. The average increased by 1.8, so the new total must be the original average plus 1.8 per person times 10 people. \n\nOriginal average is T/10. So new average is (T/10 +1.8). The new total would be 10*(T/10 +1.8) = T + 18. \n\nTherefore, the new total is T +18. But the new total is also T -53 +x. \n\nSetting them equal: T -53 +x = T +18 \u2192 x= 71. Yep, same result. \n\nSo I think that's right. The answer should be A)71.\n",

The average is total weight divided by the number of people. Since there are 10 oarsmen, the total weight change would be the difference caused by replacing one person.\n\nLet me write down what I know. Let the original average be A. So the total original weight is 10*A. After replacing the 53 kg man with the new man, the new average is A + 1.8. The new total weight would be 10*(A + 1.8). \n\nThe difference between the new total and the old total should be equal to the difference in the weights of the new and old man. Because all other 9 people stayed the same. So the new man's weight minus 53 kg must equal the total increase. \n\nLet me put that into equations. \n\nOriginal total: 10A. \nNew total: 10(A + 1.8) = 10A + 18. \n\nThe difference between new and old total is 18 kg. That difference comes from the new man being heavier than the one he replaced. So new man's weight = 53 + 18? Wait, yes. Because the total increased by 18 kg when replacing him. So the new man must be 18 kg heavier than the old one. \n\nWait, 53 plus 18 would be 71. So the answer is A)71? Let me double-check that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The total increase is 10 * 1.8 = 18 kg. The replacement caused an increase of 18 kg in total. Since the original man was 53, the new man must have added 53 plus the 18? Wait, no. Let's see. \n\nSuppose the original total was 10A. The new total is 10A + 18. The difference between the new man and the old is (new man's weight - 53) = (new total - old total). Because replacing him, so the new total is old total minus 53 plus new weight. \n\nSo (new_weight -53) = 18. So new_weight = 53 + 18 = 71. That's right.

Because sometimes I might mix up the direction of the change. \n\nIf the average went up, the new man must be heavier. So yes, 53 plus the total increase of 18 gives 71. That makes sense.
