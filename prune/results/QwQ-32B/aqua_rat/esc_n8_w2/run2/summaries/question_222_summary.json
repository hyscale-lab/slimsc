      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out Ajay's present age based on the information given. Hmm, the problem has a few steps, so I'll break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The question says: If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age and the remainder is divided by 18, then we get Rahul's present age. Then, Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, and Denis's age is 5 years. Wait, Denis is 5? That seems really young. But maybe I misread. Let me check again. \n\nOh wait, the problem says \"Denis whose age is 5 yrs\". Oh, so Denis is 5 years old. So Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis. So Rahul's age would be 5 minus 2, which is 3? That makes Rahul 3 years old? Hmm, that's possible. \n\nSo starting with Denis's age: Denis is 5. Then Rahul is 2 years younger, so 5 - 2 = 3. So Rahul is 3 now. \n\nNow, the first part connects Ajay's age to Rahul's. The problem says if you subtract 6 years from Ajay's current age and then divide the result by 18, you get Rahul's age. Let me write that as an equation. Let me denote Ajay's present age as A and Rahul's as R. \n\nSo the equation would be: (A - 6)/18 = R. Since we found that R is 3, substituting that in gives (A -6)/18 = 3. To solve for A, multiply both sides by 18: A -6 = 3 * 18. \n\n3 times 18 is 54, right? So A -6 =54. Then adding 6 to both sides gives A = 54 +6 =60. \n\nSo Ajay's age would be 60. Let me check the options. Option B is 60, so that's probably the answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through again. \n\nDenis is 5. Rahul is 2 years younger, so 5-2=3. Correct. Then Ajay's age minus 6 divided by 18 equals Rahul's age. So (A-6)/18 =3. Solving for A: multiply both sides by 18: A-6=54. Add 6: 60. Yep, that's right. \n\nThe options given are A)40, B)60, C)70, D)80, E)90. So B is the answer. I think that's correct. I don't see any errors in the steps.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine Ajay's present age, start by finding Rahul's age.

Then, it mentions that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years. Wait, Denis's age is 5? That seems really young, but maybe that's correct. Let me parse this again.\n\nFirst, let's note down the given information with variables. Let me assign variables to each person's age. Let A be Ajay's current age, R be Rahul's, and D be Denis's.\n\nFrom the problem: \n\n1. Subtracting 6 from Ajay's age, then dividing by 18 gives Rahul's age.

So D =5.\n\nWait, that seems like a key point. If Denis is 5, then Rahul is 5 -2 = 3 years old? Because Rahul is 2 years younger. That would make Rahul 3. Then plugging back into the first equation, (A-6)/18 = 3. Solving for A: multiply both sides by 18 gives A-6 = 54, so A = 60. \n\nHold on, that seems straightforward, but let me check again.

Then the rest is as I thought.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake with the order of operations? Let me see. For example, if the problem had said \"divided by 18 after subtracting 6\", which is exactly what it says, so yes, the equation is correct.\n\nHmm, the options include 60 as B, so that must be the correct answer.
