      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about figuring out my brother's current age based on the information given. Hmm, so when I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I'm 60, how old is he?\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. First, when I was 2, my brother's age was half of mine. Half of 2 is 1, so that means my brother was 1 year old at that time. So the age difference between us is 2 minus 1, which is 1 year. Wait, wait, no. Wait, if I was 2 and he was half my age, then he was 1. So the age difference between me and my brother is 1 year. That would mean he's one year younger than me, right?\n\nNow, currently, I'm 60. If he's one year younger, then he should be 59. But wait, hold on. Wait, maybe I got the difference wrong. Let me check again. Let's think: when I was 2, he was half my age. So his age then was 1. The time that has passed since then is my current age minus 2, which is 60 - 2 = 58 years. So, adding those 58 years to his age back then (which was 1), he would be 1 + 58 = 59 now. So that would make his current age 59, which is option A. But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the age difference. Let's see. The age difference is constant over time. When I was 2, he was 1. So the difference is 1 year. Therefore, now that I'm 60, he must be 60 - 1 = 59. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer must be A)59. But wait, wait a second. Wait, if the brother was half my age when I was 2, that's 1, so he's one year younger. So when I turn 60, he is 59. That seems straightforward. But why are there other options like 69, 79, etc. Maybe I'm missing something here. Let me read the question again.\n\nThe question says, \"When I was 2 years old, my brother was half my age. Now I am 60, how old is my brother?\" Hmm, maybe there's a trick here. Wait, perhaps the brother was half my age at that time, but the age difference remains the same. Let me think again. \n\nAt the time when I was 2, my brother's age was (2)/2 =1. So the age difference between us is 2 -1 =1 year. Since I am older, he is 1 year younger. Therefore, when I'm 60, he's 59. So the answer should be A. But the options given are A)59, B)69, etc. So that's the first option. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the time passed. Let me see: the time from when I was 2 until now (60 years old) is 60 - 2 = 58 years. So my brother, who was 1 at that time, now is 1 +58 =59. Yeah, that's correct. So why are the other options so much higher? Maybe the question is a trick question where the brother is older instead of younger? Let me check that scenario.\n\nSuppose when I was 2, my brother was half my age. Wait, half of 2 is 1, so that would make him younger. If the brother was half my age, he's younger. So he must be 1 at that time. So no, he can't be older. So the answer must be A. Hmm. Maybe the options are wrong? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the question. Let me read again. \n\nWait, maybe the question says \"half my age\" but in the other way. Like, if I was half his age? But that's not what it says. The question says \"my brother was half my age.\" So brother's age = (1/2)*my age at that time. So yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick me into adding instead of subtracting? Like, if when I was 2, he was half my age (so 1), then the age difference is 1 year. So when I'm 60, he's 60 +1? Wait, no. Because if I'm older, then he is younger. So the difference is 1 year, so he's 59. So the correct answer must be A. So why is the option B)69 there? Maybe someone might think that the time passed is 60 years, but no, when I was 2, now I'm 60, so 58 years have passed. \n\nWait, maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let me check the math again. 60 minus 2 is 58 years since that time. So brother's current age is 1 +58 =59. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is A. I think that's right. The options given include A as 59, so that must be the correct answer. The other options are higher, so perhaps if someone thought the age difference was 2 years, but that's not the case here. So yeah, I'm confident now that the answer is A.\n",
