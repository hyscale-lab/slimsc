      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is asking for the sum of three consecutive integers whose product is equal to the sum of 727, 728, and 729. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find three consecutive integers. Let's call them n, n+1, and n+2. Their product would be n*(n+1)*(n+2). The problem states that this product is equal to the sum of 727 + 728 + 729. Let me calculate that sum first. \n\nAdding those three numbers: 727 plus 728 is 1455, then adding 729 gives 1455 + 729. Let me do that addition. 1455 + 700 is 2155, then add 29 more: 2155 +29 = 2184. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, 727+728 is actually 727+728. Let me recalculate. 700+700 is 1400, then 27+28 is 55, so total is 1455. Then adding 729: 1455 + 700 is 2155, plus 29 more gives 2184. Wait, that seems high. Let me check again. Wait, 727+728+729. Alternatively, since they are three consecutive numbers, the average is the middle one, so 728. So sum is 728 *3. 728*3 = 2184. Yeah, that's correct. So the product of the three consecutive integers is 2184.\n\nNow I need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. Then, once I find them, their sum will be the answer. Let me think how to find these numbers. Since they are consecutive, their cube roots might be around the cube root of 2184. Let me see. The cube root of 2184 is approximately... Let's see, 12 cubed is 1728, 13 cubed is 2197. Oh, wait! 13^3 is 2197 which is very close to 2184. Hmm, so maybe the numbers are around 12 and 13?\n\nWait, but 12*13*14 would be 12*13 is 156, times 14 is 2184. Wait, that's exactly the number we need! Let me check that. 12 \u00d713 = 156. 156 \u00d714 = 2184. Yes! So the three consecutive integers are 12, 13, and 14. Their sum is 12+13+14 = 39. Looking at the options, E is 39. So the answer should be E?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The question says \"three consecutive integers\", so those numbers are indeed consecutive. The product is correct. The sum adds up to 39. The options include E)39. So that's the right answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another set of numbers? Let me think. Let's see, if I tried numbers lower, like 11,12,13: product is 11*12*13. 11*12 is 132, 132*13 is 1716, which is way less. So 12,13,14 gives exactly 2184. So that's correct. So the sum is 39, which is option E. The options given are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39. So the answer must be E.\n",

Hmm, wait, no, actually the problem says the product can be expressed as that sum. Wait, no, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The product of three consecutive integers equals 727 plus 728 plus 729? Or the product is the same as the sum of those three numbers?\n\nWait, the wording says: \"the product can be expressed as 727+728+729\". So the product equals the sum of those three numbers. The question is, find the sum of the three consecutive integers. \n\nFirst, I need to compute the sum 727 + 728 + 729. Let me add those numbers. Let's see:\n\n727 + 728 is 1455, then adding 729 would give 1455 + 729 = 2184? Wait, wait, maybe I should do it step by step. 727 plus 728 is 727 + 728 = (700 + 700) + (27 +28) = 1400 + 55 = 1455. Then adding 729: 1455 + 729. Let's break that down. 1455 + 700 = 2155, then add 29 more: 2155 +29=2184. So the product of three consecutive integers is 2184. Now I need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184, then add them up to get the answer.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think of how to find three consecutive integers whose product is 2184. Let's denote the three integers as n-1, n, n+1. Then their product would be (n-1)*n*(n+1). Alternatively, maybe they are x, x+1, x+2. Let me use x as the first integer. So x*(x+1)*(x+2) = 2184. Need to find x such that this product is 2184, then compute x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 3x +3, so 3(x+1). The sum would be 3x +3. So if I can find x, then the sum is straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe approximate the cube root of 2184 to estimate x. The cube root of 2184 is roughly, since 12^3 is 1728 and 13^3 is 2197. Wait, 13^3 is 2197. Oh, that's very close to 2184. So 13 cubed is 2197, which is 13 more than 2184. So maybe the numbers are around 12 or 13? Let me see. Let's check 12*13*14. Let's compute that: 12*13 is 156, then 156*14. 156*10 is 1560, plus 156*4 is 624, so total 1560+624=2184. Oh! Wait a second! 12*13*14 equals exactly 2184. So the three consecutive integers are 12,13,14. Their sum would be 12+13+14 = 39. Wait, but the options include E)39. So the answer should be E?\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me confirm the product again. 12\u00d713 is 156. 156\u00d714: 156 \u00d710 is 1560, 156\u00d74=624, so 1560+624=2184. Yep, that's exactly the sum. So the three numbers are 12,13,14. Their sum is 39. So the answer is E?\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options given are A)37, B)38, C)36, D)30, E)39. So E is 39, which matches. But wait, the problem says \"three consecutive integers\". Are there negative numbers possible? Let me think. Let me see if there's another triplet. Suppose the numbers are negative. Let's see, maybe if the numbers are negative, but their product is positive. For example, three negatives would multiply to a negative. Since 2184 is positive, the three numbers must be either all positive or two negatives and one positive. But consecutive integers can't have two negatives and one positive unless they cross zero, but that would require numbers like -1,0,1 but then product is zero, which is not 2184. So the numbers must be all positive. So the only triplet is 12,13,14. So their sum is 39, which is option E. \n\nWait, but wait the options have 39 as E, so that's the correct answer. Hmm. But why is the question here? Let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in calculations. The problem says the product is equal to the sum of 727+728+729. Let me re-calculate that sum again. 727+728: 727+728 is 1455. Then 1455 +729: 1455+700 is 2155, plus 29 is 2184. So yes, that's correct. So the product is indeed 2184.
