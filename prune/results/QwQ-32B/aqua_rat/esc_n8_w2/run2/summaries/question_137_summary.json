      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is about a coin-diver who gets paid 20 cents per copper coin and 25 cents per brass coin. After one dive, she made $3.40. We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought up. The options are from A to E, with the numbers decreasing. Hmm, right.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the number of copper coins as C and brass coins as B. The total amount she earned is $3.40, which is 340 cents. So the equation would be 20C +25B = 340. We need to find the minimum possible C, which would mean maximizing B as much as possible, since each brass gives more money. \n\nSo the idea is to find the maximum B possible such that when you subtract 25B from 340, the remaining amount must be divisible by 20. Because 20C = 340 -25B, so 340 -25B has to be a non-negative multiple of 20. \n\nLet me try plugging in the maximum possible B first. Let me see. Let's see what the maximum B could be. Since 25B can't exceed 340, so B_max is 340 /25 = 13.6, so 13. But maybe even less. Let's see step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let me rearrange the equation. Let me write it as 20C = 340 -25B. So 20C must be equal to 340 minus a multiple of 25. Let's see, 340 mod 25. Let me compute 340 divided by 25. 25*13 is 325, so 340-325 is 15. So 340 mod25 is 15. So 340 -25B mod20 must be 0. Wait, perhaps another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider 20C +25B =340. Let's divide the entire equation by 5 to make it simpler: 4C +5B =68. Now we need integers C and B \u22650 such that 4C +5B =68. Find the minimal C.\n\nTo minimize C, maximize B. So find the largest possible B such that 5B \u226468 and (68-5B) is divisible by 4.\n\nLet me think. Let me express this as 68 -5B must be divisible by 4. So 5B \u2261 68 mod4. Since 5 mod4 is 1, so 5B mod4 is B mod4. 68 mod4 is 0. So B mod4 must be 0. So B must be a multiple of 4. So B can be 0,4,8,12,16, etc. But since 5B \u226468, the maximum B possible is 13 (since 5*13=65, which is less than 68. 5*14=70>68). Wait but B has to be a multiple of 4? Wait, according to the congruence, B must be congruent to 0 mod4, so yes. \n\nSo let's check the largest possible B which is a multiple of 4 and \u226413. The largest such B is 12. Let's test B=12. Then 5*12=60. 68-60=8. So 4C=8 \u2192 C=2. So that would give C=2. Then the total coins would be 2 copper and 12 brass. The total would be 2*20 +12*25=40 +300=340. So that's valid. \n\nWait, but is there a higher B possible? Let's see. Next possible B multiple of 4 is 16, which would be 5*16=80, but 80>68 so no. So B=12 is the maximum possible. So then the minimum C is 2. Wait, but looking at the options, option C is 2, which would be the answer? But wait, let me check other possibilities where B is not a multiple of 4 but maybe gives a lower C?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine. The congruence was: 5B \u226168 mod4. Since 5 mod4 is 1, so 5B mod4 is same as B mod4. 68 mod4 is 0. So B mod4 must be 0. So B must be divisible by 4. So yes, the B must be a multiple of 4. So the maximum B is 12. Which gives C=2. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's another B that is not a multiple of 4 but gives a smaller C? Let me think. Let's see. Let's try B=13. Then 5*13=65. 68-65=3. 3 isn't divisible by 4, so C would be 3/4, which is not integer. So invalid.\n\nHow about B=11? 5*11=55. 68-55=13. 13/4 is 3.25. Not integer. \n\nB=10? 50. 68-50=18 \u219218/4=4.5 \u2192 no.\n\nB=9: 45 \u2192 68-45=23 \u2192 23/4=5.75 \u2192 nope.\n\nB=8: 40 \u219268-40=28. 28/4=7 \u2192 so C=7. That's higher than 2. So not better.\n\nWait, but B=12 gives C=2. So that's the minimal. So the answer is 2, which is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check other B values where B mod4 is 0 but lower than 12. Like B=8, gives C=7, which is higher. So the maximum B is indeed 12, leading to minimal C=2. So the answer should be C)2. \n\nBut wait, let me check another way. Let me see if there's a way where B is not a multiple of 4 but maybe gives a smaller C. Let me think. Let's suppose B=11. Then 5*11=55. 68-55=13 \u2192 13 isn't divisible by 4. \n\nB=7: 35 \u2192 68-35=33. 33/4=8.25 \u2192 nope. \n\nB=6: 30 \u2192 68-30=38 \u219238/4=9.5 \u2192 nope.\n\nB=5: 25 \u2192 68-25=43 \u2192 43/4=10.75 \u2192 no.\n\nB=4 \u2192 20 \u2192 68-20=48 \u219248/4=12 \u2192 C=12 \u2192 that's worse. \n\nHmm. So no, all other B's either give higher C or non-integer. So the minimal C is 2, which is option C. \n\nWait but the options have B)3, C)2, so the correct answer is C. So the answer is C.\n",

Wait, according to the congruence, B must be congruent to 0 mod4, so yes. \n\nSo let's check the largest possible B which is a multiple of 4 and \u226413. The largest such B is 12. Let's test B=12. Then 5*12=60. 68-60=8. So 4C=8 \u2192 C=2. So that would give C=2. Then the total coins would be 2 copper and 12 brass. The total would be 2*20 +12*25=40 +300=340.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. The problem is about a coin-diver who gets paid 20 cents per copper coin and 25 cents per brass coin. After a dive, she made $3.40, which is 340 cents. We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought. The options are from 0 to 4. \n\nHmm, so the question is asking for the smallest possible number of copper coins, which would mean maximizing the number of brass coins since they pay more. Because if she gets more brass coins, then fewer copper coins are needed to reach the total. So the strategy here is to see what's the maximum number of brass coins possible such that when combined with some copper coins, the total is 340 cents. Then, the remaining amount would have to be made up by copper coins, and we want that number to be as small as possible.\n\nLet me set up equations. Let\u2019s let C be the number of copper coins and B the brass coins. Then, the total earnings are 20C +25B = 340 cents. We need to find the minimal C possible. \n\nTo minimize C, we need to maximize B. So, find the largest integer B such that 25B \u2264 340, and (340 -25B) must be divisible by 20. Because the remaining amount after subtracting 25B must be exactly 20 times some integer C. \n\nLet me try possible B values starting from the highest possible. Let's see:\n\nFirst, what's the maximum possible B? 340 divided by 25 is 13.6, so B can be up to 13. But let's check each B starting from 13 downwards until we find one where (340 -25B) is divisible by 20.\n\nLet me compute for B=13: 25*13 = 325. 340-325=15. 15 isn't divisible by 20. So that's no good.\n\nNext B=12: 25*12=300. 340-300=40. 40 divided by 20 is 2. So C=2. So that would give C=2. But wait, that's possible. Wait, but is there a higher B that works?\n\nWait, B=13 didn't work. Let's check B=11: 25*11=275. 340-275=65. 65/20=3.25, which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nB=10: 250. 340-250=90. 90/20 is 4.5. Not integer.\n\nB=9: 225. 340-225=115 \u2192 115/20=5.75 \u2192 nope.\n\nB=8: 200. 340-200=140 \u2192 140/20=7. That works, but since we're trying to find the minimum C, the B=12 gives C=2, which is better (smaller C). \n\nWait, so B=12 gives C=2. Let me check B=14? Wait no, 14*25=350 which is over 340. So that's too much. So the next after 13 is 12.\n\nWait, so B=12 gives C=2. Then, is there a higher B that works? Like B=12 is the first that works, but maybe another B between 12 and 13? Like 12.5? No, B must be integer. So the next is 12. \n\nWait, but let's see B=4? Wait, maybe I need to check all possibilities. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this with equations. Let's write 20C +25B =340. We can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 5. So that gives 4C +5B =68. We need to find non-negative integers C and B such that 4C +5B =68, and find the minimal C possible.\n\nSo rearranged, 4C =68 -5B \u2192 C= (68 -5B)/4. Since C must be an integer \u22650, (68 -5B) must be divisible by 4 and non-negative.\n\nSo let's find B such that 68 -5B is divisible by 4 and 68-5B \u22650. To minimize C, we need to maximize B. So find the largest B where 68 -5B is divisible by 4 and non-negative.\n\nLet me think of B values. Let me check B mod 4. Let me see:\n\nThe equation 5B \u226168 mod4. Since 5 mod4 is 1, so 5B mod4 = B mod4. 68 mod4 is 0 (since 68 divided by4 is 17). So the equation 5B \u2261 68 mod4 simplifies to B \u22610 mod4. So B must be a multiple of 4. \n\nAh! That's a key point. Because 5B mod4 is equivalent to (5 mod4)*(B mod4) \u2192 1*(B mod4). So 5B mod4 = B mod4. So 68 mod4 is 0. So 5B mod4 must equal 0 mod4 \u2192 B mod4 must be 0. Therefore, B must be a multiple of 4. \n\nTherefore, possible B values are 0,4,8,12,16,... but since 5B can't exceed 68, the maximum B is when 5B \u226468 \u2192 B \u226413.6, so up to 13. So the maximum B that is a multiple of 4 and \u226413 is 12. \n\nSo the maximum possible B is 12. Let's plug that in. \n\nIf B=12, then C=(68 -5*12)/4 \u2192 (68-60)/4 =8/4=2. So C=2. That's the case we found earlier. \n\nSo that gives C=2. \n\nIs there a higher B that also satisfies the condition? Since the next multiple would be 16, which is over 13, so no. \n\nTherefore the minimum number of copper coins is 2. \n\nWait, but the options include 2 as option C. So the answer would be C? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me see another way. Let's check all possible B's that are multiples of 4 up to 12.\n\nCheck B=12 gives C=2. \n\nWhat about B=8? Then 5*8=40. 68-40=28 \u2192 C=28/4=7. So that's higher C. So not better. \n\nB=4: 5*4=20 \u2192 68-20=48 \u2192 C=12. \n\nB=0: then 68 \u2192 C=17. \n\nSo the maximum B gives the minimum C. So 2 is the minimal C. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 2. So the answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check if there's another B not multiple of 4 that could work. Because maybe I made a mistake in the modulo reasoning. \n\nWait the earlier step said that B must be congruent mod4 to 0. Let me re-examine that. \n\nThe equation 4C +5B =68. \n\nWe need 5B \u2261 68 mod4. 68 mod4 is 0. 5 mod4 is 1, so 5B mod4 = B mod4. \n\nTherefore, B mod4 must equal 0 mod4. So B must be divisible by 4. \n\nTherefore, only multiples of 4. So the prior reasoning holds. So B must be 0,4,8,12. \n\nThus, the maximum B is 12, leading to C=2. So the minimum C is 2. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is C)2. \n\nWait the options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0. So yes, option C is the answer. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a B that isn't a multiple of 4 but still works? Let me check with B=11, for example. Let me see:\n\nIf B=11, then 5*11=55. 68-55=13 \u2192 13/4 is 3.25, which is not integer. \n\nB=10: 50 \u2192 68-50=18 \u219218/4=4.5 no. \n\nB=9: 45 \u2192 68-45=23 \u2192 23/4 nope. \n\nB=7: 35 \u2192 68-35=33 \u2192 33/4=8.25 nope. \n\nB=6 \u219230 \u219268-30=38 \u219238/4=9.5 no. \n\nB=5 \u219225 \u219268-25=43 \u219243/4=10.75 no. \n\nB=3 \u219215 \u219268-15=53 \u219253/4 no. \n\nB=2 \u219210 \u219268-10=58 \u219258/4=14.5 no. \n\nB=1 \u21925 \u219263 \u219263/4=15.75 no. \n\nSo indeed, only when B is a multiple of 4 do we get integer C. \n\nTherefore the minimum C is 2. \n\nTherefore the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let me see. The problem is about a coin-diver who gets paid 20 cents per copper coin and 25 cents per brass coin. After a dive, she made $3.40, which is 340 cents. We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she could have brought. The options are from 0 to 4. \n\nHmm, so the question is asking for the smallest possible number of copper coins, which would mean maximizing the number of brass coins since they pay more. Because if she gets more brass coins, then fewer copper coins are needed to reach the total. So the strategy here is to see what's the maximum number of brass coins possible such that when combined with some copper coins, the total is 340 cents. Then, the remaining amount would have to be made up by copper coins, and we want that number to be as small as possible.\n\nLet me set up equations. Let\u2019s let C be the number of copper coins and B the brass coins. Then, the total earnings are 20C +25B = 340 cents. We need to find the minimal C possible. \n\nTo minimize C, we need to maximize B. So, find the largest integer B such that 25B \u2264 340, and (340 -25B) must be divisible by 20. Because the remaining amount after subtracting 25B must be exactly 20 times some integer C. \n\nLet me try possible B values starting from the highest possible. Let's see:\n\nFirst, what's the maximum possible B? 340 divided by 25 is 13.6, so B can be up to 13. But let's check each B starting from 13 downwards until we find one where (340 -25B) is divisible by 20.\n\nLet me compute for B=13: 25*13 = 325. 340-325=15. 15 isn't divisible by 20. So that's no good.\n\nNext B=12: 25*12=300. 340-300=40. 40 divided by 20 is 2. So C=2. So that would give C=2. But wait, that's possible. Wait, but is there a higher B that works?\n\nWait, B=13 didn't work. Let's check B=11: 25*11=275. 340-275=65. 65/20=3.25, which isn't an integer. So no.\n\nB=10: 250. 340-250=90. 90/20 is 4.5. Not integer.\n\nB=9: 225. 340-225=115 \u2192 115/20=5.75 \u2192 nope.\n\nB=8: 200. 340-200=140 \u2192 140/20=7. That works, but since we're trying to find the minimum C, the B=12 gives C=2, which is better (smaller C). \n\nWait, so B=12 gives C=2. Let me check B=14? Wait no, 14*25=350 which is over 340. So that's too much. So the next after 13 is 12.\n\nWait, so B=12 gives C=2. Then, is there a higher B that works? Like B=12 is the first that works, but maybe another B between 12 and 13? Like 12.5? No, B must be integer. So the next is 12. \n\nWait, but let's see B=4? Wait, maybe I need to check all possibilities. Let's think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach this with equations. Let's write 20C +25B =340. We can simplify this equation by dividing all terms by 5. So that gives 4C +5B =68. We need to find non-negative integers C and B such that 4C +5B =68, and find the minimal C possible.\n\nSo rearranged, 4C =68 -5B \u2192 C= (68 -5B)/4. Since C must be an integer \u22650, (68 -5B) must be divisible by 4 and non-negative.\n\nSo let's find B such that 68 -5B is divisible by 4 and 68-5B \u22650. To minimize C, we need to maximize B. So find the largest B where 68 -5B is divisible by 4 and non-negative.\n\nLet me think of B values. Let me check B mod 4. Let me see:\n\nThe equation 5B \u226168 mod4. Since 5 mod4 is 1, so 5B mod4 = B mod4. 68 mod4 is 0 (since 68 divided by4 is 17). So the equation 5B \u2261 68 mod4 simplifies to B \u22610 mod4. So B must be a multiple of 4. \n\nAh! That's a key point. Because 5B mod4 is equivalent to (5 mod4)*(B mod4) \u2192 1*(B mod4). So 5B mod4 = B mod4. So 68 mod4 is 0. So 5B mod4 must equal 0 mod4 \u2192 B mod4 must be 0. Therefore, B must be a multiple of 4. \n\nTherefore, possible B values are 0,4,8,12,16,... but since 5B can't exceed 68, the maximum B is when 5B \u226468 \u2192 B \u226413.6, so up to 13. So the maximum B that is a multiple of 4 and \u226413 is 12. \n\nSo the maximum possible B is 12. Let's plug that in. \n\nIf B=12, then C=(68 -5*12)/4 \u2192 (68-60)/4 =8/4=2. So C=2. That's the case we found earlier. \n\nSo that gives C=2. \n\nIs there a higher B that also satisfies the condition? Since the next multiple would be 16, which is over 13, so no. \n\nTherefore the minimum number of copper coins is 2. \n\nWait, but the options include 2 as option C. So the answer would be C? Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me see another way. Let's check all possible B's that are multiples of 4 up to 12.\n\nCheck B=12 gives C=2. \n\nWhat about B=8? Then 5*8=40. 68-40=28 \u2192 C=28/4=7. So that's higher C. So not better. \n\nB=4: 5*4=20 \u2192 68-20=48 \u2192 C=12. \n\nB=0: then 68 \u2192 C=17. \n\nSo the maximum B gives the minimum C. So 2 is the minimal C. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 2. So the answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check if there's another B not multiple of 4 that could work. Because maybe I made a mistake in the modulo reasoning. \n\nWait the earlier step said that B must be congruent mod4 to 0. Let me re-examine that. \n\nThe equation 4C +5B =68. \n\nWe need 5B \u2261 68 mod4. 68 mod4 is 0. 5 mod4 is 1, so 5B mod4 = B mod4. \n\nTherefore, B mod4 must equal 0 mod4. So B must be divisible by 4. \n\nTherefore, only multiples of 4. So the prior reasoning holds. So B must be 0,4,8,12. \n\nThus, the maximum B is 12, leading to C=2. So the minimum C is 2. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is C)2. \n\nWait the options are A)4, B)3, C)2, D)1, E)0. So yes, option C is the answer. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's a B that isn't a multiple of 4 but still works? Let me check with B=11, for example. Let me see:\n\nIf B=11, then 5*11=55. 68-55=13 \u2192 13/4 is 3.25, which is not integer. \n\nB=10: 50 \u2192 68-50=18 \u219218/4=4.5 no. \n\nB=9: 45 \u2192 68-45=23 \u2192 23/4 nope. \n\nB=7: 35 \u2192 68-35=33 \u2192 33/4=8.25 nope. \n\nB=6 \u219230 \u219268-30=38 \u219238/4=9.5 no. \n\nB=5 \u219225 \u219268-25=43 \u219243/4=10.75 no. \n\nB=3 \u219215 \u219268-15=53 \u219253/4 no. \n\nB=2 \u219210 \u219268-10=58 \u219258/4=14.5 no. \n\nB=1 \u21925 \u219263 \u219263/4=15.75 no. \n\nSo indeed, only when B is a multiple of 4 do we get integer C. \n\nTherefore the minimum C is 2. \n\nTherefore the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine the minimum number of copper coins (C) the diver could have brought, we set up the equation \\(20C + 25B = 340\\) cents, where B is the number of brass coins. Simplifying by dividing by 5 gives \\(4C + 5B = 68\\). To minimize \\(C\\), we maximize \\(B\\). \n\nAnalyzing modulo 4 constraints:  \n\\(5B \\equiv 68 \\mod 4\\) simplifies to \\(B \\equiv 0 \\mod 4\\), so \\(B\\) must be a multiple of 4. The largest such \\(B\\) under 13.6 (since \\(25B \\leq 340\\)) is 12. Substituting \\(B = 12\\):  \n\\(4C + 5(12) = 68 \\Rightarrow 4C = 8 \\Rightarrow C = 2\\).  \n\nTesting smaller multiples of 4 (e.g., \\(B = 8, 4, 0\\)) yields higher \\(C\\). Non-multiples of 4 for \\(B\\) do not satisfy the equation with integer \\(C\\). Thus, the minimum \\(C\\) is **2**.\n\nAnswer: C",
