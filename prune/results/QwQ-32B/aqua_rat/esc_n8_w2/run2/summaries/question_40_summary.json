      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so there's this question about finding the average speed of an airplane flying around a square. Hmm, let me think. The problem says the plane flies along the four sides of a square at different speeds: 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/h. I need to find the average speed around the field. \n\nWait, average speed is total distance divided by total time, right? Yeah, that's the basic formula. Since it's a square, all the sides are equal in length. Let's denote each side as 's' kilometers. So the total distance around the square would be 4s. \n\nNow, to find the average speed, I need to compute the total time taken for each side and add them up. Because the speed varies for each side, the time for each side will be different. \n\nLet me break it down. The first side is at 200 km/h. Time taken for that would be distance over speed, so s/200 hours. The second side at 400 km/h would take s/400 hours. The third side at 600 km/h would be s/600, and the fourth at 800 km/h is s/800. \n\nAdding all those times together gives the total time. So total time T = (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800). \n\nThe total distance is 4s, so average speed is total distance divided by total time. That would be 4s divided by T. \n\nBut since the s is common in all terms, maybe I can factor that out. Let me see. Let's factor s out of the denominator. The total time equation can be written as s*(1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800). \n\nSo then the average speed becomes 4s divided by [s*(sum of reciprocals)]. The s cancels out, so it's 4 divided by (sum of reciprocals). \n\nNow, I need to compute that sum. Let me calculate the sum of the reciprocals first. Let's see:\n\n1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 +1/800. To add these fractions, I need a common denominator. What's the least common multiple of 200,400,600,800? Hmm. Let's see. Breaking them down:\n\n200 = 2^3 * 5^2\n\n400 = 2^4 *5^2\n\n600 = 2^3 *3 *5^2\n\n800 = 2^5 *5^2\n\nSo LCM would be the highest exponents of each prime factor. So 2^5, 3^1, 5^2. So 32 *3 *25 = 32*75 = 2400. So LCM is 2400. \n\nSo converting each term to denominator 2400:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400 (since 2400/200 =12)\n\n1/400 = 6/2400 (2400/400=6)\n\n1/600 =4/2400 (2400/600=4)\n\n1/800=3/2400 (2400/800=3)\n\nAdding those numerators: 12 +6 +4 +3 =25. So the sum is 25/2400. \n\nTherefore, the sum of reciprocals is 25/2400. \n\nNow the average speed is 4 divided by (25/2400). Let's compute that. \n\nDividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal. So 4 * (2400/25) = (4*2400)/25. \n\nLet me calculate that. 2400 divided by 25 is 96, because 25*96 = 2400. So 4 *96 = 384. \n\nOh wait, so the average speed would be 384 km/h. Looking at the options, option A is 384. \n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. Maybe I made an error in the calculation steps. Let me verify each part again. \n\nFirst, the sum of the reciprocals:\n\n1/200 +1/400 is (2+1)/400 = 3/400. Wait, maybe an alternative way. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, let's compute each term as decimal to check.\n\n1/200 =0.005\n\n1/400=0.0025\n\n1/600\u22480.001666666...\n\n1/800=0.00125\n\nAdding those up: 0.005 +0.0025 is 0.0075, plus 0.0016666 is ~0.0091666, plus 0.00125 gives 0.010416666...\n\nWait, so 0.010416666... multiplied by s is the total time per s. Let me see, when I calculated the fractions earlier, I had 25/2400. Let me compute 25 divided by 2400. 25/2400 = 1/96 \u22480.010416666..., which matches. So that's correct. \n\nSo the sum is indeed 25/2400. \n\nSo 4 divided by (25/2400) is 4*(2400/25) = 4*(96) = 384. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be A)384. \n\nLooking at the options, yes, option A is 384. So that's the correct choice. \n\nI think that makes sense. The average speed isn't just the arithmetic mean of the speeds, but the harmonic mean weighted by distance. Since each side is the same distance, the formula for average speed when distances are equal is the harmonic mean. The formula is indeed (number of terms) divided by the sum of reciprocals. Which in this case, exactly what I did. \n\nAlternatively, harmonic mean for four speeds when each distance is same: 4/(1/200 +1/400+1/600+1/800). Which is exactly what I calculated. So the answer is A.\n",

Hmm, average speed can sometimes be tricky because it's not just the average of the speeds. I remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. Right, so I need to figure out the total distance the plane travels and the total time it takes, then divide one by the other.\n\nThe problem says it's a square, so all four sides are equal in length. Let's call the length of each side 's'. That means the total distance around the square (the perimeter) is 4s. But since each side has a different speed, the time taken for each side will vary.\n\nWait, to find the average speed, I need the total distance divided by the total time. Since each side is the same distance, but different speeds, I can compute the time for each side as distance divided by speed. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nLet me denote each side as Side 1, 2, 3, 4 with speeds 200, 400, 600, 800 km/h respectively. The distance for each side is s, so the time taken for each side would be s divided by their respective speed.\n\nTotal time would be (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800). Then total distance is 4s. So average speed would be (4s) divided by that total time.\n\nBut since s is a common factor, it will cancel out. Let me write that out:\n\nAverage speed = Total Distance / Total Time = 4s / [ (s/200) + (s/400) + (s/600) + (s/800) ]\n\nFactor out the s in the denominator:\n\n= 4s / [ s (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800) ) ]\n\nThe s cancels, so:\n\n= 4 / (1/200 + 1/400 + 1/600 + 1/800 )\n\nNow I need to compute the sum of those reciprocals. Let's calculate each term:\n\nFirst, convert all to fractions with a common denominator. The denominators are 200, 400, 600, 800. Let's see, the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers. Hmm, 200 factors into 2^3 *5^2, 400 is 2^4*5^2, 600 is 2^3*3*5^2, 800 is 2^5*5^2. So LCM would be the highest exponents: 2^5, 3^1, 5^2. So 32*3*25 = 32*75=2400. So LCM is 2400. Let me check:\n\n200 divides into 2400 12 times, 400 divides 6 times, 600 divides 4 times, 800 divides 3 times. Yep.\n\nSo converting each fraction to denominator 2400:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400,\n\n1/400 = 6/2400,\n\n1/600 = 4/2400,\n\n1/800 = 3/2400.\n\nAdding them up: 12 +6 +4 +3 = 25. So total is 25/2400.\n\nSo the denominator in the average speed equation is 25/2400. Therefore:\n\nAverage speed = 4 divided by (25/2400) = 4 * (2400/25) \n\nCalculating that: 2400 divided by 25 is 96. Then 4 * 96 = 384. Wait, that's 4 multiplied by 96? Let me check:\n\nWait, 2400/25 = 96. So 4*(2400/25) = (4*2400)/25 = 9600/25. Let me compute that. 25*384 = 9600. Yes, because 25*400 is 10,000, so 25*(400-16)= 25*384. So 9600/25 = 384.\n\nSo the average speed would be 384 km/h. Looking at the options, option A is 384. So the answer should be A?\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have messed up the fractions.\n\nWait, the sum of the reciprocals:\n\n1/200 + 1/400 +1/600 +1/800. Let me compute each term as decimals to see:\n\n1/200 is 0.005,\n\n1/400 is 0.0025,\n\n1/600 is ~0.0016666667,\n\n1/800 is 0.00125.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n0.005 +0.0025 = 0.0075,\n\nplus 0.0016666667 gives ~0.0091666667,\n\nplus 0.00125 gives 0.0104166667.\n\nSo total sum is approximately 0.0104166667.\n\nThen 4 divided by that is 4 / 0.0104166667.\n\nLet me compute that: 4 divided by 0.0104166667.\n\nWell, 1 divided by 0.0104166667 is approximately 96 (since 1/0.0104166667 is 96, because 1/ (25/2400) is 2400/25=96). So 4 times that is 384. Yep, same as before. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be A) 384. Let me check the options again. The options given are A)384, B)562, C)458, D)156, E)452. So A is indeed the first option. \n\nHmm, I think that's right. The key was to realize that average speed is total distance over total time, and since each side is same distance, you can treat them as equal distances and use the harmonic mean approach for each segment. Since each segment is same distance, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the speeds, but since there are four equal distances, the formula would be 4/(1/s1 +1/s2 +1/s3 +1/s4). Wait, actually, no. Wait the formula is total distance divided by total time, which is indeed (sum of distances) divided by sum of (distance_i / speed_i). Since all distances are same, say 's', so total distance is 4s, and total time is s(1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800). So the formula works out as 4/(sum of 1/speed terms). So yes, that's exactly what I did.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is A.\n",

Let me check:\n\n200 divides into 2400 12 times, 400 divides 6 times, 600 divides 4 times, 800 divides 3 times. Yep.\n\nSo converting each fraction to denominator 2400:\n\n1/200 = 12/2400,\n\n1/400 = 6/2400,\n\n1/600 = 4/2400,\n\n1/800 = 3/2400.\n\nAdding them up: 12 +6 +4 +3 = 25. So total is 25/2400.\n\nSo the denominator in the average speed equation is 25/2400. Therefore:\n\nAverage speed = 4 divided by (25/2400) = 4 * (2400/25) \n\nCalculating that: 2400 divided by 25 is 96. Then 4 * 96 = 384. Wait, that's 4 multiplied by 96? Let me check:\n\nWait, 2400/25 = 96. So 4*(2400/25) = (4*2400)/25 = 9600/25. Let me compute that. 25*384 = 9600. Yes, because 25*400 is 10,000, so 25*(400-16)= 25*384. So 9600/25 = 384.\n\nSo the average speed would be 384 km/h. Looking at the options, option A is 384. So the answer should be A?\n\nWait a second, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might have messed up the fractions.\n\nWait, the sum of the reciprocals:\n\n1/200 + 1/400 +1/600 +1/800. Let me compute each term as decimals to see:\n\n1/200 is 0.005,\n\n1/400 is 0.0025,\n\n1/600 is ~0.0016666667,\n\n1/800 is 0.00125.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n0.005 +0.0025 = 0.0075,\n\nplus 0.0016666667 gives ~0.0091666667,\n\nplus 0.00125 gives 0.0104166667.\n\nSo total sum is approximately 0.0104166667.\n\nThen 4 divided by that is 4 / 0.0104166667.\n\nLet me compute that: 4 divided by 0.0104166667.\n\nWell, 1 divided by 0.0104166667 is approximately 96 (since 1/0.0104166667 is 96, because 1/ (25/2400) is 2400/25=96). So 4 times that is 384. Yep, same as before. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer should be A) 384. Let me check the options again. The options given are A)384, B)562, C)458, D)156, E)452. So A is indeed the first option. \n\nHmm, I think that's right. The key was to realize that average speed is total distance over total time, and since each side is same distance, you can treat them as equal distances and use the harmonic mean approach for each segment. Since each segment is same distance, the average speed is the harmonic mean of the speeds, but since there are four equal distances, the formula would be 4/(1/s1 +1/s2 +1/s3 +1/s4). Wait, actually, no. Wait the formula is total distance divided by total time, which is indeed (sum of distances) divided by sum of (distance_i / speed_i). Since all distances are same, say 's', so total distance is 4s, and total time is s(1/200 +1/400 +1/600 +1/800). So the formula works out as 4/(sum of 1/speed terms). So yes, that's exactly what I did.\n\nSo I think the correct answer is A.\n\n\nTo find the average speed of the aeroplane around the square, we use the formula for average speed, which is total distance divided by total time. Let each side of the square be \\( s \\) km. The total distance is \\( 4s \\). The time taken for each side is \\( \\frac{s}{\\text{speed}} \\). \n\nThe total time is:\n\\[\n\\frac{s}{200} + \\frac{s}{400} + \\frac{s}{600} + \\frac{s}{800}\n\\]\n\nFactoring out \\( s \\), the average speed becomes:\n\\[\n\\text{Average speed} = \\frac{4s}{s \\left( \\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800} \\right)} = \\frac{4}{\\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the sum of reciprocals:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{200} + \\frac{1}{400} + \\frac{1}{600} + \\frac{1}{800} = \\frac{12}{2400} + \\frac{6}{2400} + \\frac{4}{2400} + \\frac{3}{2400} = \\frac{25}{2400}\n\\]\n\nThus, the average speed is:\n\\[\n\\frac{4}{\\frac{25}{2400}} = \\frac{4 \\times 2400}{25} = \\frac{9600}{25} = 384 \\text{ km/hr}\n\\]\n\nThe correct answer is **A) 384**.\n\nAnswer: A",
