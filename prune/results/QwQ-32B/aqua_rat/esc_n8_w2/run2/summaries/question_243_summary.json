      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem says: If one third of 3/4 of a number is 21, find the number. Hmm, I need to translate this into an equation. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let the number be x. Then, 3/4 of the number would be (3/4)x. Now, one third of that 3/4 part. So taking one third of (3/4)x. That would be (1/3) multiplied by (3/4)x. And according to the problem, this equals 21. \n\nSo putting that into an equation: (1/3)*(3/4)x = 21. Let me compute the left side. Multiplying 1/3 and 3/4. The 3s might cancel out. Let's see, 1/3 times 3/4 is (1*3)/(3*4) = 3/12, which simplifies to 1/4. Wait, so that simplifies to (1/4)x equals 21. \n\nOh right, so (1/4)x =21. To find x, I need to multiply both sides by 4. That gives x = 21 *4. 21 times 4 is 84. So the number should be 84. Let me check the options. Option A is 84. So the answer must be A.\n\nWait, let me double-check my steps. The problem says one third of 3/4 of the number. Let me plug 84 back in. 3/4 of 84 is 63. Then one third of 63 is 21. Yep, that matches the given condition. So yeah, A is correct. The other options don't fit. Like if I tried option C, 28: 3/4 of 28 is 21, then one third of that is 7, which isn't 21. So definitely A.\n",

Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the wording. \"One third of 3/4 of a number is 21.\" So, let's let the number be x. Then, three fourths of the number would be (3/4)x. Then, taking one third of that would be (1/3) multiplied by (3/4)x. And that equals 21. \n\nSo putting that into an equation: (1/3) * (3/4)x = 21.
