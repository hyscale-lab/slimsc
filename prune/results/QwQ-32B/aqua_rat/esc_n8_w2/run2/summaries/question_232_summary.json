      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about converting the weight of a bag of cat food from pounds and ounces into just ounces. Hmm, right. So the given weight is 7 pounds and 4 ounces. I need to figure out how many ounces that is total.\n\nFirst, I remember that there are 16 ounces in a pound. So, if the bag is 7 pounds, I should convert those pounds into ounces first. Let me do that multiplication. 7 times 16... Let me calculate that. 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 6 is 42, so adding those gives 112. So 7 pounds is 112 ounces. Then, there's an extra 4 ounces added to that. So I need to add 112 and 4 together. 112 plus 4 is 116. Wait, but let me check again. Because sometimes I might mix up the conversion factors. Like, is it 16 ounces in a pound? Yeah, I think that's right. Like, 1 lb is 16 oz. So 7 pounds would be 7*16=112, plus the 4 gives 116 total ounces. Let me look at the options. Option C is 116. So the answer should be C?\n\nWait, let me make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. 16 times 7: 10*16 is 160, but wait no, 7 times 16. Let me break it down again. 10 pounds would be 160 ounces, so 7 is less. 7*16: 5*16 is 80, and 2*16 is 32, so 80+32 is 112. Yeah that's correct. Then adding the 4 ounces gives 116. So yes, option C. The options given are A)108, B)112, C)116, D)120, E)124. So C is the right one. I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes here.\n",
