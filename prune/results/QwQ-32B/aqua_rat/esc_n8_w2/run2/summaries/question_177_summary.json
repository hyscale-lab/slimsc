      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out this multiplication table problem. The question gives me a multiplication setup where M A D multiplied by B E equals A M I D. The options are different numbers for the letters M, A, D, B, E, I. Wait, actually, looking at the options, each option has four numbers. Wait, the options list four digits, maybe each corresponding to M, A, D, B? Hmm, the problem says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options are labeled A to E. Let me read again carefully.\n\nThe setup is:\n\n   M A D\nx   B E\n------------\n   M A D      (this is the first partial product, probably from multiplying by E)\nR A E         (this is the second partial product, shifted one position to the left, so multiplied by B)\n------------\nA M I D       (the final product)\n\nSo, the multiplication is (MAD) * (BE) = AMID. The partial products are MAD (times E) and RAE (times B, shifted left by one). Adding those gives the final product A M I D.\n\nHmm. The letters here are M, A, D, B, E, R, I. The options are given as four numbers each. Wait, the options probably correspond to the values of M, A, D, B. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions are A) 9 2 0 0, B)9 2 0 9, C)9 2 0 1, D)9 2 0 7, E)9 2 2 2.\n\nWait, the first three numbers might be M, A, D and the fourth is B? Because the options have four digits. Let's see. The problem's variables are M, A, D, B, E, R, I. So each letter represents a unique digit, probably. So I need to figure out what digits they represent so that the multiplication works out.\n\nFirst, let me note the structure:\n\nThe multiplication is:\n\n   M A D\nx   B E\n--------\n   M A D (this is MAD * E)\n+ R A E 0 (since it's shifted left, so it's MAD * B multiplied by 10)\n--------\nA M I D\n\nWait, actually, the second partial product is R A E, but when shifted left (because multiplying by the tens place, B), it would be R A E followed by a zero? Wait, no. Let me think. When you multiply by B (the tens digit of the multiplier BE), you shift left by one, so the second partial product is (MAD * B) shifted left by one. So the written partial product R A E would actually be the result of MAD * B, but written as R A E with a zero at the end? Wait, no, perhaps the way it's written, the RAE is the product of MAD * B, but written shifted left, so the R A E is the actual digits, and when you add the two partial products, you get the total.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write the multiplication step by step.\n\nLet me denote the numbers as:\n\nMAD is a three-digit number, BE is a two-digit number. Their product is AMID, a four-digit number.\n\nThe first partial product is MAD * E = MAD (the same as the original number). Wait that can't be right unless E is 1. Because if you multiply MAD by E and get the same number, then E must be 1. Because 123 * 1 = 123. So that suggests E is 1?\n\nWait, but looking at the second partial product, RAE. So when you multiply MAD by B, you get RAE? So MAD * B = RAE (a three-digit number). But when you shift it left by one (because B is the tens place), you get RAE0, then adding to the first partial product (MAD) gives the total. Wait, but the total is AMID, which is four digits. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second partial product is written as RAE shifted left, so R A E in the second line is actually the product of MAD * B, but shifted so that it's R A E multiplied by 10 (so the actual value is (RAE)*10). Then adding the first partial product (MAD) to this gives the total product.\n\nSo the total product would be (MAD * E) + (MAD * B * 10) = MAD*(E + 10*B) = AMID.\n\nSo, let's think of variables. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nMAD = 100*M + 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nThe product is (100*M +10*A + D)*(10*B + E) = A*1000 + M*100 + I*10 + D.\n\nThe first partial product is MAD * E = (100*M +10*A + D)*E = M A D (the same as the original MAD). Wait, that can only happen if E=1. Because if E is 1, then multiplying MAD by 1 gives MAD again. So E must be 1. That's a key point.\n\nSo E = 1.\n\nThen the second partial product is MAD * B. Let's call that value X. Since the second partial product is written as R A E, which is R A 1 (since E is 1). So X = R A 1 (three-digit number: 100*R + 10*A +1).\n\nBut when you multiply MAD by B, you get R A 1. So:\n\n(100*M +10*A + D) * B = 100*R + 10*A +1.\n\nAlso, the total product is (MAD * E) + (MAD * B *10) = MAD*(1 + 10*B) = AMID.\n\nSo AMID is a four-digit number where the first digit is A, the second M, third I, fourth D. So:\n\nAMID = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n(100*M +10*A + D)*(1 + 10*B) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nHmm, this is getting complex. Let's see if we can find the values step by step.\n\nFirst, since E is 1, the first partial product is MAD *1 = MAD, so that's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's look at the second partial product. The product of MAD * B must be R A 1 (since it's written as R A E with E=1). So when you multiply MAD by B, you get a three-digit number where the middle digit is A, the last digit is 1, and the first digit is R.\n\nAlso, when you add the two partial products (MAD and R A 1 shifted left by one (so multiplied by 10)), you get AMID.\n\nSo:\n\nMAD (the first partial product) + (RA1 * 10) = AMID.\n\nSo, let's write that as:\n\n(100*M +10*A + D) + (10*(100*R + 10*A +1)) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n100*M + 10*A + D + 10*(100R +10A +1) = \n\n100M +10A + D + 1000R +100A +10 \n\n= 1000R + (100M) + (10A +100A) + D +10 \n\n= 1000R + 100M + 110A + D +10 \n\nThe right side is 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSo setting left = right:\n\n1000R + 100M + 110A + D +10 = 1000A +100M +10I + D\n\nLet's subtract the right side from both sides:\n\n1000R + 110A +10 - (1000A +10I) = 0 \n\nSimplify:\n\n1000R + 110A +10 -1000A -10I =0 \n\n1000R - 890A -10I +10 =0 \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, maybe there's a better approach. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at the final product AMID. The last digit of AMID is D. Let's see the last digit comes from the first partial product's last digit (D) plus the second partial product's last digit shifted left (so the second partial product's last digit is 1, so when shifted, it contributes to the tens place. Wait, no, the second partial product RAE is shifted left by one, so its last digit (the 1 in the units place of RAE) becomes the tens place in the total. So the units digit of the total product AMID is the units digit of the first partial product's units digit (D) plus any carryover from the previous addition. Since the second partial product's units digit after shifting would contribute to the tens place, not the units. Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe addition is:\n\n   M A D\n+ R A 1 0 (since R A E shifted left by one is R A 1 followed by a zero)\n------------\nA M I D\n\nWait, no, actually, the second partial product is R A E, which when shifted left (because it's multiplied by the B, the tens place), so it's effectively multiplied by 10, so the second partial product's value is (R A E) *10. So when written out, the second partial product is written as R A E 0? Wait, no. The way the multiplication is presented:\n\nThe first partial product is MAD (units place of BE, which is E=1). The second partial product is MAD * B, written as RAE shifted left by one digit (so it's R A E in the tens place, so the actual number would be R A E *10). So when adding the two, the units digit comes from the first partial product's units digit (D) plus the second's units digit (0, since it's shifted left). So the units digit of the total product is D. Which matches the given AMID's last digit D. So that's consistent.\n\nThe tens digit of the total product is I. That comes from the tens digit of the first partial product (A) plus the units digit of the second partial product (E=1, but shifted left so that digit is in the tens place). Wait, no. Wait, the second partial product when shifted left by one, so the RAE is written as R A E in the tens, hundreds, etc. So the second partial product's digits are:\n\nThe first partial product (MAD) has digits M (hundreds), A (tens), D (units).\n\nThe second partial product (RAE shifted left by one) is R (hundreds place?), A (tens?), E (units?) but shifted left, so actually, the R is in the hundreds place, A in the tens, E in the units? Wait no, when you shift left by one, the digits move up one place. So RAE as a three-digit number multiplied by 10 becomes RAE0. So when added to MAD, the addition would be:\n\n  M A D\n+ R A E 0\n----------\nA M I D\n\nWait, but in the problem's setup, the second partial product is written as R A E, so perhaps the alignment is:\n\nThe first line is MAD (aligned to the right, units under units).\n\nThe second line is RAE shifted left by one, so its units digit is under the tens place of the first.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write it as:\n\nLet me think of the addition:\n\n       M  A  D\n    +  R  A  E  (but shifted left by one, so actually it's R A E multiplied by 10, so written as R A E 0)\n    ------------\n      A  M  I  D\n\nWait, but the problem's written multiplication shows the second partial product as R A E. So perhaps the alignment is:\n\nThe first partial product is MAD (so units digit D).\n\nThe second partial product (from multiplying by B) is RAE, but shifted left one digit, so it's written as:\n\n   R A E\nbut shifted, so it's actually R A E 0 (but written as R A E in the next line with a space?), but the total is added to give A M I D.\n\nSo the addition is:\n\n   M A D\n+ R A E 0\n----------\nA M I D\n\nWait, but the total has four digits. So the sum of the two three-digit numbers (MAD and RAE0) must be a four-digit number starting with A.\n\nSo:\n\nMAD + (RAE *10) = AMID.\n\nSo let me write this as:\n\n(100*M +10*A + D) + ( (100*R + 10*A +1)*10 ) = 1000*A + 100*M +10*I + D.\n\nWait, because E is 1, so RAE is R A 1, so RAE*10 = 10*(100R +10A +1).\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\nLeft = 100M +10A + D + 1000R + 100A +10 \n\n= 1000R + (100M) + (10A +100A) + D +10 \n\n= 1000R + 100M +110A + D +10.\n\nThe right side is 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n1000R +100M +110A + D +10 = 1000A +100M +10I + D \n\nSubtracting the right from left:\n\n1000R +110A +10 -1000A -10I =0 \n\n1000R -890A -10I +10 =0 \n\nHmm, that's a bit complex. Let's see if we can find some constraints.\n\nFirst, since AMID is a four-digit number starting with A, A can't be zero. Also, M is the second digit, so M can be 0? Wait, but M is the first digit of MAD, which is a three-digit number, so M can't be zero.\n\nAlso, since E is 1, and looking at the second partial product RAE (R A 1), when multiplying MAD by B gives R A 1. Let's think of the multiplication MAD * B = R A 1.\n\nSo, the product of MAD (a three-digit number) and B (a single digit) must be a three-digit number ending with 1. Since E is 1, the units digit comes from D * E = D *1 = D. But in the first partial product, the units digit is D, which matches. Also, when multiplying MAD by B, the units digit of that product (R A 1) is 1. So D * B mod 10 must be 1?\n\nWait, no. Wait, when multiplying MAD by B, the units digit is (D * B) mod 10, but the result's units digit is 1. So D*B mod10 = 1.\n\nBecause the second partial product's units digit is 1 (since E is 1 in R A E? Wait, no, the second partial product's units digit is actually the units digit of MAD*B, which is R A 1. So the units digit of MAD*B is 1. So D * B mod10 = 1.\n\nSo D*B ends with 1.\n\nPossible pairs (D,B) where D*B mod10=1. Possible pairs:\n\nPossible B and D digits (0-9, but B can't be 0 because BE is a two-digit number, so B is 1-9. D can be 0-9.\n\nLooking for D and B where D*B ends with 1.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1*1=1 \u2192 D=1, B=1.\n\n3*7=21 \u2192 D=3, B=7; D=7, B=3.\n\n9*9=81 \u2192 D=9, B=9.\n\nAlso 9*1=9 \u2192 no. Wait, 9*9 ends with 1? 9*9 is 81, yes. So possible pairs:\n\n(1,1), (3,7), (7,3), (9,9). Also, 13* something? Wait, D and B can be other numbers as well. Like 11, but D and B are single digits. So those are the possibilities.\n\nNow, since E is 1, and the first partial product is MAD*E = MAD, so that's okay.\n\nNow, looking at the first partial product's tens digit. The first partial product is MAD, so its tens digit is A. The second partial product when shifted left contributes its tens digit (A) to the hundreds place? Wait, maybe let's look at the addition step.\n\nLet me think about the addition of the two partial products:\n\nM A D\n\n+ R A E 0\n\n= A M I D.\n\nWait, when adding:\n\nThe units digit is D (from first) + 0 (from the shifted second) \u2192 D. Which matches the total's D, so that's okay.\n\nThe tens digit comes from A (from first) + E (from the shifted second's units place, but actually, when shifted, the second's units digit is E*10? Wait, no. Wait, the second partial product is RAE *10, so the digits are R A E 0. So the second's tens digit is A, and the first's tens is A. So adding the tens digits: the first's tens is A (position 10^1), and the second's tens is A (since the second is R A E 0, so the tens digit is A). So adding A (from first) + A (from second) plus any carryover from the units place (which was D + 0, so no carryover unless D is >=10, but D is a digit so no). So the total's tens digit is (A + A) mod 10 = 2A mod10. But in the total AMID, the tens digit is I. So 2A mod10 = I. And there might be a carryover to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds place: the first's hundreds digit is M, the second's hundreds digit is A (since the second is R A E0, so hundreds place is A). Adding those plus any carryover from the tens digit. Let's see:\n\nThe hundreds digit in total is M (the second digit of AMID). Wait, the total's hundreds digit is M. Let me think step by step:\n\nLet me write the addition column by column.\n\nUnits column:\n\nD (from first) + 0 (from second shifted) = D \u2192 units digit D. Correct.\n\nTens column:\n\nA (from first) + E (from the second's tens? Wait, wait. Wait the second partial product is R A E 0, so when written as:\n\nFirst partial:     M A D\n\nSecond partial: R A E 0 (shifted left, so aligned to the left by one digit)\n\nWait, perhaps the alignment is:\n\nThe first partial product is written as:\n\n   M A D\n\nThe second partial product (from B) is shifted left by one, so it's written as:\n\n  R A E (but actually R A E 0, so the digits are R (hundreds), A (tens), E (units) but shifted, so the actual value is R A E *10, which is R A E 0. So when added:\n\n       M  A  D\n\n    +  R  A  E  0\n\n    ------------\n\n      A  M  I  D\n\nWait, but the way it's written in the problem, the second partial is R A E, so in the problem's table:\n\nThe first partial is M A D (no shift), the second is R A E shifted left by one (so the R is in the hundreds place?), so when added, the total is A M I D.\n\nSo the addition would be:\n\nM A D\n\n+ R A E shifted left (so becomes R A E 0)\n\nThe addition would be:\n\n   M A D\n\n+ R A E 0\n\n------------\n\nA M I D\n\nSo the digits in the hundreds place of the second partial is A (from the second's tens place?), but let's break it down:\n\nLet me think of each digit column:\n\nUnits digit: D + 0 = D \u2192 correct.\n\nTens digit: A (from first) + E (from second's tens place?) Wait, the second's tens place (the digit in the tens place of the second partial product when shifted) is A, since the second is R A E 0, so the tens digit is A (since the second's digits are R (hundreds), A (tens), E (units) but shifted left by one digit, so when written as R A E 0, the tens place is A. So:\n\nTens column: A (first) + E (from the second's tens place?) Wait, no. Wait the second partial's tens digit is A (since the second's number is R A E 0, so the tens digit is A). So adding the tens digits: A (from first) + A (from second) = 2A. The result's tens digit is I. So 2A mod 10 = I. And the carryover to hundreds is floor(2A /10).\n\nHundreds place: M (from first) + R (from second's hundreds place) plus the carryover from tens (carryover C1 = floor(2A/10)) \u2192 equals the hundreds digit of the total, which is M (since the total is A M I D). So:\n\nM + R + C1 = M + 10*C2 + M ?\n\nWait, wait. The hundreds digit in the total is the second digit from the left, which is M. So the sum in the hundreds place must be equal to M plus any carryover from the thousands place? Wait, perhaps I need to consider all columns:\n\nLet me structure it properly:\n\nThe addition:\n\n       1 2 3 4 (columns from right: units, tens, hundreds, thousands)\n\nFirst partial (MAD):\n\nColumn 1: D\n\nColumn 2: A\n\nColumn 3: M\n\nColumn 4: 0 (since it's a three-digit number)\n\nSecond partial (RAE0):\n\nColumn 1: 0 (since shifted left, so units place is 0)\n\nColumn 2: E (from the original RAE's units digit, but shifted to tens?)\n\nWait, no. Wait the second partial is RAE0. So:\n\nRAE0's digits are:\n\nThousands: R (if it's a four-digit number?), no. Wait R A E 0 is four digits only if R is non-zero. Wait RAE is a three-digit number (since it's the product of MAD * B, which is three digits). So RAE0 is four digits: R (thousands?), A (hundreds), E (tens), 0 (units). Wait, no. Wait if RAE is three digits, then RAE0 is four digits: R (hundreds?), A (tens?), E (units?), but shifted left by one, so:\n\nWait, perhaps the second partial product (MAD * B) is a three-digit number R A E, so when multiplied by 10 (shifted left), it becomes a four-digit number R A E 0. So the columns are:\n\nFirst partial (M A D):\n\nColumns: \n\nUnits (1): D\n\nTens (2): A\n\nHundreds (3): M\n\nThousands (4): 0\n\nSecond partial (R A E 0):\n\nUnits (1): 0\n\nTens (2): E\n\nHundreds (3): A\n\nThousands (4): R\n\nSo when adding them:\n\nColumn 1 (units): D + 0 = D \u2192 matches.\n\nColumn 2 (tens): A + E \u2192 must give the tens digit I in the total (since the total's tens digit is I). Wait, the total's tens digit is the second digit from the right? Wait the total is A M I D. So the digits are:\n\nThousands place: A\n\nHundreds place: M\n\nTens place: I\n\nUnits: D\n\nWait that can't be. Wait the total is AMID, so:\n\nA is thousands digit, M is hundreds, I is tens, D is units. So:\n\nThe thousands place comes from the addition's thousands column.\n\nSo let me re-express the columns properly:\n\nTotal is A (thousands), M (hundreds), I (tens), D (units). So the columns (from right to left):\n\nUnits (D), tens (I), hundreds (M), thousands (A).\n\nThe two partial products:\n\nFirst partial (MAD):\n\n- Units (D), tens (A), hundreds (M), thousands (0).\n\nSecond partial (RAE0):\n\n- Units (0), tens (E), hundreds (A), thousands (R).\n\nAdding these:\n\nUnits column (D +0 = D \u2192 correct).\n\nTens column: A (from first) + E (from second) = I + 10*C1 (carryover to hundreds).\n\nHundreds column: M (first) + A (second) + C1 = M + 10*C2 (carryover to thousands).\n\nThousands column: 0 (first) + R (second) + C2 = A (since the thousands digit is A).\n\nSo let's write equations for each column:\n\n1. Units: D = D \u2192 okay.\n\n2. Tens column:\n\nA + E = I + 10*C1 \u2192 (1)\n\n3. Hundreds column:\n\nM + A + C1 = M + 10*C2 \u2192 subtract M: A + C1 = 10*C2 \u2192 (2)\n\n4. Thousands column:\n\nR + C2 = A \u2192 (3)\n\nAlso, since the second partial product is R A E (the product of MAD * B), which is a three-digit number R A E. So:\n\nMAD * B = R A E \u2192 (4)\n\nAdditionally, E is 1, as established earlier.\n\nSo E =1.\n\nLet me substitute E =1 into the equations.\n\nEquation (1): A +1 = I +10*C1 \u2192 I = A +1 -10*C1.\n\nEquation (2): A + C1 =10*C2 \u2192 since A and C1 are digits (A is 0-9, C1 is 0 or 1 or maybe 2? Because A is a digit, adding 1 (E=1) gives at most A+1 \u2264 9+1=10, so C1 can be 0 or 1.\n\nWait in equation (1), the maximum A +1 can be 9+1=10, so C1 can be 0 or 1.\n\nCase 1: C1 =0.\n\nThen equation (1) \u2192 I = A +1 -0 \u2192 I =A+1.\n\nEquation (2) \u2192 A +0 =10*C2 \u2192 since A is a digit (0-9), 10*C2 must equal A. So possible only if A is 0 or 10, but A is a digit, so A=0 and C2=0. But A can't be zero because AMID's thousands digit is A, which can't be zero. So this case is invalid unless A=0, which is invalid.\n\nCase 2: C1 =1.\n\nThen equation (1): I =A +1 -10*1 =A -9.\n\nSince I must be a digit (0-9), A -9 \u22650 \u2192 A \u22659. But A is a digit (0-9), so A must be 9, making I=0.\n\nEquation (2): A +1 =10*C2 \u2192 A+1 must be divisible by 10. Since A=9, then 9+1=10 \u2192 C2=1.\n\nSo C2=1.\n\nEquation (3): R + C2 = A \u2192 R +1 = A \u2192 since A=9 \u2192 R =8.\n\nSo from this, we have:\n\nE=1,\n\nA=9,\n\nI =0,\n\nC1=1,\n\nC2=1,\n\nR =8.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nNow, let's see what we have:\n\nFrom the second partial product:\n\nMAD * B = R A E \u2192 R is 8, A is9, E is1 \u2192 8 9 1 \u2192 so 891.\n\nSo MAD * B = 891.\n\nAlso, the thousands column equation gives R + C2 = A \u2192 8+1=9 \u2192 correct.\n\nNow, the total product is AMID \u2192 A=9, so it's 9 M I D \u2192 9 M 0 D (since I=0).\n\nThe total product is also equal to (MAD)*(BE). Since BE is B followed by E (1). So BE is 10*B +1.\n\nThe total product is (100*M +10*A + D)*(10*B +1) = 9000 + 100*M + 0*10 + D = 9000 +100*M + D.\n\nSo:\n\n(100*M +90 + D)*(10*B +1) = 9000 +100*M + D.\n\nHmm, but also, since MAD * B = 891, so (100*M +90 + D)*B =891.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n(100*M +90 + D)*B =891 \u2192 Let me call the MAD number as X = 100*M +90 + D.\n\nSo X*B =891.\n\nWe need to find integers M (digit 1-9, since it's the first digit of MAD), D (digit 0-9), B (digit 1-9), such that X*B =891, and also (X)*(10*B +1) = 9000 +100*M + D.\n\nAlso, X is a three-digit number: 100*M +90 + D \u2192 between 100*1 +90 +0 =190 and 999 (if M=9, D=9: 900+90+9=999). But since X*B=891, X must be a factor of 891, and B must be an integer between 1 and 9.\n\nLet me factorize 891 to find possible factors:\n\n891 \u00f7 3 = 297 \u2192 3*297.\n\n297 \u00f73=99 \u2192 3*3*99.\n\n99=9*11 \u2192 so 891= 3^4 *11.\n\nSo factors of 891:\n\n1, 3, 9, 11, 27, 33, 81, 99, 297, 891.\n\nLooking for three-digit factors X (between 100 and 999) and B (1-9). So possible X and B pairs:\n\nCheck each possible X which is a three-digit factor of 891:\n\nPossible X:\n\n11 is two-digit, so next is 27 (two-digit), 33 (two-digit), 81 (two-digit). 99 (two-digit). Then 111? No, but factors are only up to 297 and 891.\n\nWait 3^4 *11 is 81*11 = 891. So factors:\n\nPossible three-digit factors:\n\n- 11 \u00d7 81 = 891 \u2192 but 11 is two-digit, 81 is two-digit. Not helpful.\n\nWait 891 divided by 9 is 99 \u2192 9\u00d799=891. 99 is two-digit. 891 divided by 33 is 27 \u2192 no. Hmm.\n\nWait 891 divided by 27 is 33 \u2192 no. Wait, perhaps 891 divided by 297 is 3 \u2192 so 297 \u00d73=891. So 297 is a three-digit factor. So possible X=297 and B=3.\n\nOr X= 99 \u00d79 \u2192 but 99 is two-digit. Alternatively, X= 891 and B=1, but 891 is three-digit. Let's see:\n\nPossible three-digit factors of 891:\n\n297 \u00d73 =891 \u2192 X=297, B=3.\n\nAlso, 891 \u00d71 =891 \u2192 X=891, B=1.\n\nAnother three-digit factor is 891 itself. So possibilities:\n\nCase 1: X=297, B=3.\n\nCase 2: X=891, B=1.\n\nCheck these possibilities.\n\nFirst, case 1: X=297, B=3.\n\nSo MAD = 297 \u2192 M=2, A=9 (matches our earlier A=9), D=7.\n\nThen, check if this fits into the equations.\n\nSo M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3.\n\nThen, the second partial product is 297 *3= 891 \u2192 which is R A E \u2192 8 9 1 \u2192 R=8, which matches our earlier R=8 (from equation R= A-1=9-1=8? Wait earlier we had R + C2 =A \u2192 R+1=9 \u2192 R=8, yes. So that's okay.\n\nNow check the total product.\n\nTotal product is (297)*(BE). BE is B followed by E (which is 1). B=3, so BE is 31.\n\n297 \u00d731 = ?\n\nCalculate that: 297 *30 =8910, plus 297*1=297 \u2192 total 8910 +297 =9207.\n\nThe total product is supposed to be AMID \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7 \u2192 9 2 0 7 \u2192 9207. Which matches exactly.\n\nSo this works. Now check the options. The options are given as four digits, probably M, A, D, B.\n\nIn this case, M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3. Looking at the options:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9? No.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2, etc. Not matching.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2, no.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9? Not.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 also not.\n\nWait, none of these options have M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3. Wait, the options given are A)9 2 0 0, B)9 2 0 9, C)9 2 0 1, D)9 2 0 7, E)9 2 2 2. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, the options are four numbers each, but maybe the letters are M, A, D, I? Because the problem's question is \"decipher the following multiplication table\", and the options list four digits. The question might be asking for the values of M, A, D, B, but the options have four numbers. Wait the problem says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options are labeled with four numbers. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait the question is \"Decipher the following multiplication table: [the setup], and the options are A to E, each with four numbers. The problem is probably asking for the values of M, A, D, B in order. Let me see the options:\n\nOption D is 9 2 0 7. Hmm, but in my case M is 2, so the first digit would be 2, but option D starts with 9. Wait, maybe I messed up the order?\n\nWait, maybe the options are M, A, D, B. Let's see.\n\nIn my solution:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7, B=3 \u2192 so the numbers would be 2,9,7,3. But none of the options have those.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the assumption. Let me check the other case.\n\nCase 2: X=891, B=1.\n\nSo MAD = 891 \u2192 M=8, A=9, D=1.\n\nThen, B=1. But B is part of the multiplier BE, where E=1, so BE would be 11. But B can't be 1 here because in this case, the second partial product is MAD * B =891 *1=891. So the second partial product R A E is 8 9 1. So R=8, A=9, E=1. Which fits.\n\nNow, the total product would be 891 *11 = 9801. But AMID would be A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1 \u2192 9801. Which matches.\n\nSo in this case, the values are:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1, B=1.\n\nSo the four numbers would be M=8, A=9, D=1, B=1 \u2192 8 9 1 1. None of the options have that either. The options given are:\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=0 \u2192 but B can't be 0.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 B=9.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 B=1.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 B=7.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 B=2.\n\nHmm, so in my first case, the values were M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, which doesn't match any options. The second case M=8, A=9, D=1, B=1 \u2192 which would correspond to option C if the order is M, A, D, B. Because option C is 9 2 0 1. Wait no, the first number would be M. If M is 8 in case 2, then it's 8, 9, 1, 1 \u2192 not in options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another case I didn't consider.\n\nWait, let's check if there are other factors. Let me re-examine the factor pairs.\n\n891 divided by 3 is 297 \u2192 so (X=297, B=3).\n\nDivided by 9 \u2192 891/9=99 \u2192 X=99 (two-digit, so no).\n\nDivided by 11 \u2192 891/11=81 \u2192 two-digit.\n\nDivided by 27 \u2192 891/27=33 \u2192 two-digit.\n\nDivided by 33 \u2192 27 \u2192 two-digit.\n\nDivided by 81 \u2192 11 \u2192 two-digit.\n\nDivided by 99 \u21929 \u2192 two-digit.\n\nDivided by 297 \u21923 \u2192 three-digit X=297, B=3.\n\nDivided by 891 \u21921 \u2192 three-digit X=891, B=1.\n\nSo those are the only possibilities for three-digit X.\n\nHmm, but the options given don't match either of these. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a possible case where C1 is 2? Let me revisit the equations.\n\nEarlier, I considered C1 can be 0 or 1 because in equation (1), A + E (E=1) can be up to 9+1=10, so the maximum carryover is 1. But wait, perhaps there's another scenario where:\n\nWait in equation (1): A + E = I + 10*C1. The maximum A+E can be is 9+1=10, so C1 can be 0 or 1. So no, that part is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming E=1. Let me recheck that.\n\nThe first partial product is MAD * E = MAD. So unless E=1, that can't happen. Because if E is 1, then yes. Otherwise, if E is 0, then the first partial product would be 0, which can't be. So E must be 1.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nHmm. So in the first case, where X=297, B=3 gives us the total product 9207, which is AMID \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. So the letters are:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nNow, looking at the options, the options are four digits each, perhaps representing M, A, D, B?\n\nIf so, then in this case, the numbers would be 2 (M),9 (A),7 (D),3 (B). The options don't have this combination. The closest is option D:9 2 0 7, which would be M=9, A=2, D=0, B=7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are M, A, D, I? Because in the options, the fourth number is I? Let me see the options again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 maybe M=9, A=2, D=0, I=0.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=9.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=1.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=2, I=2.\n\nWait, perhaps the question's options are M, A, D, I? Because the product is AMID, so those are the four letters. The problem says \"decipher the following multiplication table\", so perhaps the question is asking for the values of M, A, D, I? The options have four digits each, so that would make sense. The letters in the options could be M, A, D, I.\n\nIn my first case, the values are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0. So that would be 2 9 7 0. None of the options have that. The second case (X=891) gives M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0 (since AMID is 9801 \u2192 I=0). So 8 9 1 0, but options don't have that either.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption that E=1. Let me think again.\n\nWait the first partial product is MAD multiplied by E, and the result is written as MAD. So the multiplication by E must not change the number. The only possibility is that E is 1, since multiplying by 1 leaves it the same. Any other digit would change the number. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. The problem's options don't seem to match the cases I found. Maybe I missed another case?\n\nWait let's see. Let me think of the second case again where X=891 and B=1. Then:\n\nMAD is 891 \u2192 M=8, A=9, D=1.\n\nB=1, E=1 \u2192 BE is 11.\n\nTotal product is 891 \u00d711 =9801 \u2192 AMID is 9 8 0 1 \u2192 A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1.\n\nSo M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0. If the options are for M, A, D, I, then it would be 8 9 1 0. Not in the options.\n\nHmm. The options given are all starting with 9 in the first digit except option A which is 9 2 0 0. Wait option B is 9 2 0 9, etc. So maybe the question's options are in the order M, A, D, B. Let me see:\n\nIn the first case (297*31=9207):\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7, B=3 \u2192 so M,A,D,B \u2192 2,9,7,3 \u2192 not in options.\n\nSecond case (891 *11=9801):\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1, B=1 \u2192 8,9,1,1 \u2192 not in options.\n\nHmm. The options given are:\n\nA) 9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=0 \u2192 but B can't be 0.\n\nB) 9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=9 \u2192 check if possible.\n\nLet me try with option B's values: M=9, A=2, D=0, B=9.\n\nThen, let's see if this works.\n\nE is still 1.\n\nFirst partial product: MAD * E = 920 *1 =920 \u2192 which matches the first partial product.\n\nSecond partial product: MAD * B =920 *9 = 8280 \u2192 but since it's three-digit? Wait 920 *9 is 8280, which is four digits, but the second partial product is supposed to be R A E (three digits). So this is impossible. Thus option B is invalid.\n\nOption C: 9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=1.\n\nThen, first partial product is 920 *1 =920.\n\nSecond partial product is 920 *1 =920 \u2192 but shifted left gives 9200. Adding 920 +9200 = 10120, which is a five-digit number, but the total should be AMID (four-digit). So invalid.\n\nOption D: 9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=7.\n\nFirst partial product: 920 *1=920.\n\nSecond partial product: 920 *7 =6440 \u2192 which is four-digit, but the partial product should be three-digit (R A E). So that's four digits, impossible. So invalid.\n\nOption E: 9 2 2 2 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=2, B=2.\n\nFirst partial product: 922*1=922.\n\nSecond partial product: 922*2=1844 \u2192 four digits again, which is too long.\n\nHmm, none of the options are working. This suggests that perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the first partial product is the same as MAD. Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nThe problem's multiplication is:\n\n   M A D\n\nx   B E\n\n------------\n\n   M A D   (this is the first partial product, from multiplying by E)\n\nR A E      (this is the second partial product, from multiplying by B, shifted left by one)\n\n------------\n\nA M I D\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the second partial product is R A E shifted left by one, so when written, it's actually R A E 0? So when adding the two partial products (MAD and RAE0), the total is AMID.\n\nWait in my previous analysis, that's what I did, but maybe the second partial product's written as R A E but actually it's R A E shifted left, so it's R A E *10, which is R A E 0. So the second partial product must be a three-digit number R A E, so when multiplied by B, MAD * B must be R A E, a three-digit number. So that requires that MAD * B is three digits, so B must be small enough so that MAD * B is three digits.\n\nIn the first case I considered, when MAD was 297 and B=3 \u2192 297*3=891, which is three digits. So that works.\n\nBut in the options given, none of them fit. So maybe the question has a different setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait let's try to consider option D: 9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=7.\n\nLet me try plugging in these values:\n\nM=9, A=2, D=0 \u2192 MAD is 920.\n\nB=7, E=1 (since first partial product must be MAD).\n\nThen, first partial product is 920 \u00d71 =920.\n\nSecond partial product is 920 \u00d77 =6440 \u2192 but this is four digits. However, the problem's second partial product is written as R A E. So 6440 would have to be R A E followed by a zero, but that's four digits. So the written partial product would be 6440 \u2192 but the problem says it's R A E (three digits). So that's impossible. Thus option D is invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait maybe I messed up the order of the letters in the final product. The final product is AMID. If in the first case (M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3), then the total is 9207, so A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. So the letters would be A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. So the four letters A, M, I, D are 9, 2, 0, 7. The options are given as four numbers, perhaps in that order: A, M, I, D. Let's see.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=0 \u2192 but D should be7.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 D=9, not.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 D=1.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 yes, this would be A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. Which matches the first case's result.\n\nAh! So the question's options are the values of A, M, I, D in order. So the four numbers are A, M, I, D.\n\nIn the first case, those values are 9,2,0,7 \u2192 which matches option D.\n\nAh! That must be it. The options are A, M, I, D.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option D)9 2 0 7.\n\nLet me verify this again:\n\nIf the options are A, M, I, D:\n\nIn the first case (M=2, A=9, I=0, D=7), the sequence is A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7 \u2192 exactly option D.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out this multiplication table problem. The question gives me a multiplication setup where M A D multiplied by B E equals A M I D. The options are different numbers for the letters M, A, D, B, E, I. Wait, actually, looking at the options, each option has four numbers. Wait, the options list four digits, maybe each corresponding to M, A, D, B? Hmm, the problem says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options are labeled A to E. Let me read again carefully.\n\nThe setup is:\n\n   M A D\nx   B E\n------------\n   M A D      (this is the first partial product, probably from multiplying by E)\nR A E         (this is the second partial product, shifted one position to the left, so multiplied by B)\n------------\nA M I D       (the final product)\n\nSo, the multiplication is (MAD) * (BE) = AMID. The partial products are MAD (times E) and RAE (times B, shifted left by one). Adding those gives the final product A M I D.\n\nHmm. The letters here are M, A, D, B, E, R, I. The options are given as four numbers each. Wait, the options probably correspond to the values of M, A, D, B.

Because the options have four digits. Let's see. The problem's variables are M, A, D, B, E, R, I. So each letter represents a unique digit, probably. So I need to figure out what digits they represent so that the multiplication works out.\n\nFirst, let me note the structure:\n\nThe multiplication is:\n\n   M A D\nx   B E\n--------\n   M A D (this is MAD * E)\n+ R A E 0 (since it's shifted left, so it's MAD * B multiplied by 10)\n--------\nA M I D\n\nWait, actually, the second partial product is R A E, but when shifted left (because multiplying by the tens place, B), it would be R A E followed by a zero? Wait, no. Let me think. When you multiply by B (the tens digit of the multiplier BE), you shift left by one, so the second partial product is (MAD * B) shifted left by one. So the written partial product R A E would actually be the result of MAD * B, but written as R A E with a zero at the end? Wait, no, perhaps the way it's written, the RAE is the product of MAD * B, but written shifted left, so the R A E is the actual digits, and when you add the two partial products, you get the total.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write the multiplication step by step.\n\nLet me denote the numbers as:\n\nMAD is a three-digit number, BE is a two-digit number. Their product is AMID, a four-digit number.\n\nThe first partial product is MAD * E = MAD (the same as the original number). Wait that can't be right unless E is 1. Because if you multiply MAD by E and get the same number, then E must be 1. Because 123 * 1 = 123. So that suggests E is 1?\n\nWait, but looking at the second partial product, RAE. So when you multiply MAD by B, you get RAE? So MAD * B = RAE (a three-digit number). But when you shift it left by one (because B is the tens place), you get RAE0, then adding to the first partial product (MAD) gives the total. Wait, but the total is AMID, which is four digits. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second partial product is written as RAE shifted left, so R A E in the second line is actually the product of MAD * B, but shifted so that it's R A E multiplied by 10 (so the actual value is (RAE)*10). Then adding the first partial product (MAD) to this gives the total product.\n\nSo the total product would be (MAD * E) + (MAD * B * 10) = MAD*(E + 10*B) = AMID.\n\nSo, let's think of variables. Let me assign variables:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nMAD = 100*M + 10*A + D\n\nBE = 10*B + E\n\nThe product is (100*M +10*A + D)*(10*B + E) = A*1000 + M*100 + I*10 + D.\n\nThe first partial product is MAD * E = (100*M +10*A + D)*E = M A D (the same as the original MAD). Wait, that can only happen if E=1. Because if E is 1, then multiplying MAD by 1 gives MAD again. So E must be 1. That's a key point.\n\nSo E = 1.\n\nThen the second partial product is MAD * B. Let's call that value X. Since the second partial product is written as R A E, which is R A 1 (since E is 1). So X = R A 1 (three-digit number: 100*R + 10*A +1).\n\nBut when you multiply MAD by B, you get R A 1. So:\n\n(100*M +10*A + D) * B = 100*R + 10*A +1.\n\nAlso, the total product is (MAD * E) + (MAD * B *10) = MAD*(1 + 10*B) = AMID.\n\nSo AMID is a four-digit number where the first digit is A, the second M, third I, fourth D. So:\n\nAMID = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nPutting this together:\n\n(100*M +10*A + D)*(1 + 10*B) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nHmm, this is getting complex. Let's see if we can find the values step by step.\n\nFirst, since E is 1, the first partial product is MAD *1 = MAD, so that's straightforward.\n\nNow, let's look at the second partial product. The product of MAD * B must be R A 1 (since it's written as R A E with E=1). So when you multiply MAD by B, you get a three-digit number where the middle digit is A, the last digit is 1, and the first digit is R.\n\nAlso, when you add the two partial products (MAD and R A 1 shifted left by one (so multiplied by 10)), you get AMID.\n\nSo:\n\nMAD (the first partial product) + (RA1 * 10) = AMID.\n\nSo, let's write that as:\n\n(100*M +10*A + D) + (10*(100*R + 10*A +1)) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\n100*M + 10*A + D + 10*(100R +10A +1) = \n\n100M +10A + D + 1000R +100A +10 \n\n= 1000R + (100M) + (10A +100A) + D +10 \n\n= 1000R + 100M + 110A + D +10 \n\nThe right side is 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSo setting left = right:\n\n1000R + 100M + 110A + D +10 = 1000A +100M +10I + D\n\nLet's subtract the right side from both sides:\n\n1000R + 110A +10 - (1000A +10I) = 0 \n\nSimplify:\n\n1000R + 110A +10 -1000A -10I =0 \n\n1000R - 890A -10I +10 =0 \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, maybe there's a better approach. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps looking at the final product AMID. The last digit of AMID is D. Let's see the last digit comes from the first partial product's last digit (D) plus the second partial product's last digit shifted left (so the second partial product's last digit is 1, so when shifted, it contributes to the tens place. Wait, no, the second partial product RAE is shifted left by one, so its last digit (the 1 in the units place of RAE) becomes the tens place in the total. So the units digit of the total product AMID is the units digit of the first partial product's units digit (D) plus any carryover from the previous addition. Since the second partial product's units digit after shifting would contribute to the tens place, not the units. Wait, let me think again.\n\nThe addition is:\n\n   M A D\n+ R A 1 0 (since R A E shifted left by one is R A 1 followed by a zero)\n------------\nA M I D\n\nWait, no, actually, the second partial product is R A E, which when shifted left (because it's multiplied by the B, the tens place), so it's effectively multiplied by 10, so the second partial product's value is (R A E) *10. So when written out, the second partial product is written as R A E 0? Wait, no. The way the multiplication is presented:\n\nThe first partial product is MAD (units place of BE, which is E=1). The second partial product is MAD * B, written as RAE shifted left by one digit (so it's R A E in the tens place, so the actual number would be R A E *10). So when adding the two, the units digit comes from the first partial product's units digit (D) plus the second's units digit (0, since it's shifted left). So the units digit of the total product is D. Which matches the given AMID's last digit D. So that's consistent.\n\nThe tens digit of the total product is I. That comes from the tens digit of the first partial product (A) plus the units digit of the second partial product (E=1, but shifted left so that digit is in the tens place). Wait, no. Wait, the second partial product when shifted left by one, so the RAE is written as R A E in the tens, hundreds, etc. So the second partial product's digits are:\n\nThe first partial product (MAD) has digits M (hundreds), A (tens), D (units).\n\nThe second partial product (RAE shifted left by one) is R (hundreds place?), A (tens?), E (units?) but shifted left, so actually, the R is in the hundreds place, A in the tens, E in the units? Wait no, when you shift left by one, the digits move up one place. So RAE as a three-digit number multiplied by 10 becomes RAE0. So when added to MAD, the addition would be:\n\n  M A D\n+ R A E 0\n----------\nA M I D\n\nWait, but in the problem's setup, the second partial product is written as R A E, so perhaps the alignment is:\n\nThe first line is MAD (aligned to the right, units under units).\n\nThe second line is RAE shifted left by one, so its units digit is under the tens place of the first.\n\nWait, maybe it's better to write it as:\n\nLet me think of the addition:\n\n       M  A  D\n    +  R  A  E  (but shifted left by one, so actually it's R A E multiplied by 10, so written as R A E 0)\n    ------------\n      A  M  I  D\n\nWait, but the problem's written multiplication shows the second partial product as R A E. So perhaps the alignment is:\n\nThe first partial product is MAD (so units digit D).\n\nThe second partial product (from multiplying by B) is RAE, but shifted left one digit, so it's written as:\n\n   R A E\nbut shifted, so it's actually R A E 0 (but written as R A E in the next line with a space?), but the total is added to give A M I D.\n\nSo the addition is:\n\n   M A D\n+ R A E 0\n----------\nA M I D\n\nWait, but the total has four digits. So the sum of the two three-digit numbers (MAD and RAE0) must be a four-digit number starting with A.\n\nSo:\n\nMAD + (RAE *10) = AMID.\n\nSo let me write this as:\n\n(100*M +10*A + D) + ( (100*R + 10*A +1)*10 ) = 1000*A + 100*M +10*I + D.\n\nWait, because E is 1, so RAE is R A 1, so RAE*10 = 10*(100R +10A +1).\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\nLeft = 100M +10A + D + 1000R + 100A +10 \n\n= 1000R + (100M) + (10A +100A) + D +10 \n\n= 1000R + 100M +110A + D +10.\n\nThe right side is 1000A +100M +10I + D.\n\nSet them equal:\n\n1000R +100M +110A + D +10 = 1000A +100M +10I + D \n\nSubtracting the right from left:\n\n1000R +110A +10 -1000A -10I =0 \n\n1000R -890A -10I +10 =0 \n\nHmm, that's a bit complex. Let's see if we can find some constraints.\n\nFirst, since AMID is a four-digit number starting with A, A can't be zero. Also, M is the second digit, so M can be 0? Wait, but M is the first digit of MAD, which is a three-digit number, so M can't be zero.\n\nAlso, since E is 1, and looking at the second partial product RAE (R A 1), when multiplying MAD by B gives R A 1. Let's think of the multiplication MAD * B = R A 1.\n\nSo, the product of MAD (a three-digit number) and B (a single digit) must be a three-digit number ending with 1. Since E is 1, the units digit comes from D * E = D *1 = D. But in the first partial product, the units digit is D, which matches. Also, when multiplying MAD by B, the units digit of that product (R A 1) is 1. So D * B mod 10 must be 1?\n\nWait, no. Wait, when multiplying MAD by B, the units digit is (D * B) mod 10, but the result's units digit is 1. So D*B mod10 = 1.\n\nBecause the second partial product's units digit is 1 (since E is 1 in R A E? Wait, no, the second partial product's units digit is actually the units digit of MAD*B, which is R A 1. So the units digit of MAD*B is 1. So D * B mod10 = 1.\n\nSo D*B ends with 1.\n\nPossible pairs (D,B) where D*B mod10=1. Possible pairs:\n\nPossible B and D digits (0-9, but B can't be 0 because BE is a two-digit number, so B is 1-9. D can be 0-9.\n\nLooking for D and B where D*B ends with 1.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n1*1=1 \u2192 D=1, B=1.\n\n3*7=21 \u2192 D=3, B=7; D=7, B=3.\n\n9*9=81 \u2192 D=9, B=9.\n\nAlso 9*1=9 \u2192 no. Wait, 9*9 ends with 1? 9*9 is 81, yes. So possible pairs:\n\n(1,1), (3,7), (7,3), (9,9). Also, 13* something? Wait, D and B can be other numbers as well. Like 11, but D and B are single digits. So those are the possibilities.\n\nNow, since E is 1, and the first partial product is MAD*E = MAD, so that's okay.\n\nNow, looking at the first partial product's tens digit. The first partial product is MAD, so its tens digit is A. The second partial product when shifted left contributes its tens digit (A) to the hundreds place? Wait, maybe let's look at the addition step.\n\nLet me think about the addition of the two partial products:\n\nM A D\n\n+ R A E 0\n\n= A M I D.\n\nWait, when adding:\n\nThe units digit is D (from first) + 0 (from the shifted second) \u2192 D. Which matches the total's D, so that's okay.\n\nThe tens digit comes from A (from first) + E (from the shifted second's units place, but actually, when shifted, the second's units digit is E*10? Wait, no. Wait, the second partial product is RAE *10, so the digits are R A E 0. So the second's tens digit is A, and the first's tens is A. So adding the tens digits: the first's tens is A (position 10^1), and the second's tens is A (since the second is R A E 0, so the tens digit is A). So adding A (from first) + A (from second) plus any carryover from the units place (which was D + 0, so no carryover unless D is >=10, but D is a digit so no). So the total's tens digit is (A + A) mod 10 = 2A mod10. But in the total AMID, the tens digit is I. So 2A mod10 = I. And there might be a carryover to the hundreds place.\n\nThe hundreds place: the first's hundreds digit is M, the second's hundreds digit is A (since the second is R A E0, so hundreds place is A). Adding those plus any carryover from the tens digit. Let's see:\n\nThe hundreds digit in total is M (the second digit of AMID). Wait, the total's hundreds digit is M. Let me think step by step:\n\nLet me write the addition column by column.\n\nUnits column:\n\nD (from first) + 0 (from second shifted) = D \u2192 units digit D. Correct.\n\nTens column:\n\nA (from first) + E (from the second's tens? Wait, wait. Wait the second partial product is R A E 0, so when written as:\n\nFirst partial:     M A D\n\nSecond partial: R A E 0 (shifted left, so aligned to the left by one digit)\n\nWait, perhaps the alignment is:\n\nThe first partial product is written as:\n\n   M A D\n\nThe second partial product (from B) is shifted left by one, so it's written as:\n\n  R A E (but actually R A E 0, so the digits are R (hundreds), A (tens), E (units) but shifted, so the actual value is R A E *10, which is R A E 0. So when added:\n\n       M  A  D\n\n    +  R  A  E  0\n\n    ------------\n\n      A  M  I  D\n\nWait, but the way it's written in the problem, the second partial is R A E, so in the problem's table:\n\nThe first partial is M A D (no shift), the second is R A E shifted left by one (so the R is in the hundreds place?), so when added, the total is A M I D.\n\nSo the addition would be:\n\nM A D\n\n+ R A E shifted left (so becomes R A E 0)\n\nThe addition would be:\n\n   M A D\n\n+ R A E 0\n\n------------\n\nA M I D\n\nSo the digits in the hundreds place of the second partial is A (from the second's tens place?), but let's break it down:\n\nLet me think of each digit column:\n\nUnits digit: D + 0 = D \u2192 correct.\n\nTens digit: A (from first) + E (from second's tens place?) Wait, the second's tens place (the digit in the tens place of the second partial product when shifted) is A, since the second is R A E 0, so the tens digit is A (since the second's digits are R (hundreds), A (tens), E (units) but shifted left by one digit, so when written as R A E 0, the tens place is A. So:\n\nTens column: A (first) + E (from the second's tens place?) Wait, no. Wait the second partial's tens digit is A (since the second's number is R A E 0, so the tens digit is A). So adding the tens digits: A (from first) + A (from second) = 2A. The result's tens digit is I. So 2A mod 10 = I. And the carryover to hundreds is floor(2A /10).\n\nHundreds place: M (from first) + R (from second's hundreds place) plus the carryover from tens (carryover C1 = floor(2A/10)) \u2192 equals the hundreds digit of the total, which is M (since the total is A M I D). So:\n\nM + R + C1 = M + 10*C2 + M ?\n\nWait, wait. The hundreds digit in the total is the second digit from the left, which is M. So the sum in the hundreds place must be equal to M plus any carryover from the thousands place? Wait, perhaps I need to consider all columns:\n\nLet me structure it properly:\n\nThe addition:\n\n       1 2 3 4 (columns from right: units, tens, hundreds, thousands)\n\nFirst partial (MAD):\n\nColumn 1: D\n\nColumn 2: A\n\nColumn 3: M\n\nColumn 4: 0 (since it's a three-digit number)\n\nSecond partial (RAE0):\n\nColumn 1: 0 (since shifted left, so units place is 0)\n\nColumn 2: E (from the original RAE's units digit, but shifted to tens?)\n\nWait, no. Wait the second partial is RAE0. So:\n\nRAE0's digits are:\n\nThousands: R (if it's a four-digit number?), no. Wait R A E 0 is four digits only if R is non-zero. Wait RAE is a three-digit number (since it's the product of MAD * B, which is three digits). So RAE0 is four digits: R (thousands?), A (hundreds), E (tens), 0 (units). Wait, no. Wait if RAE is three digits, then RAE0 is four digits: R (hundreds?), A (tens?), E (units?), but shifted left by one, so:\n\nWait, perhaps the second partial product (MAD * B) is a three-digit number R A E, so when multiplied by 10 (shifted left), it becomes a four-digit number R A E 0. So the columns are:\n\nFirst partial (M A D):\n\nColumns: \n\nUnits (1): D\n\nTens (2): A\n\nHundreds (3): M\n\nThousands (4): 0\n\nSecond partial (R A E 0):\n\nUnits (1): 0\n\nTens (2): E\n\nHundreds (3): A\n\nThousands (4): R\n\nSo when adding them:\n\nColumn 1 (units): D + 0 = D \u2192 matches.\n\nColumn 2 (tens): A + E \u2192 must give the tens digit I in the total (since the total's tens digit is I). Wait, the total's tens digit is the second digit from the right? Wait the total is A M I D. So the digits are:\n\nThousands place: A\n\nHundreds place: M\n\nTens place: I\n\nUnits: D\n\nWait that can't be. Wait the total is AMID, so:\n\nA is thousands digit, M is hundreds, I is tens, D is units. So:\n\nThe thousands place comes from the addition's thousands column.\n\nSo let me re-express the columns properly:\n\nTotal is A (thousands), M (hundreds), I (tens), D (units). So the columns (from right to left):\n\nUnits (D), tens (I), hundreds (M), thousands (A).\n\nThe two partial products:\n\nFirst partial (MAD):\n\n- Units (D), tens (A), hundreds (M), thousands (0).\n\nSecond partial (RAE0):\n\n- Units (0), tens (E), hundreds (A), thousands (R).\n\nAdding these:\n\nUnits column (D +0 = D \u2192 correct).\n\nTens column: A (from first) + E (from second) = I + 10*C1 (carryover to hundreds).\n\nHundreds column: M (first) + A (second) + C1 = M + 10*C2 (carryover to thousands).\n\nThousands column: 0 (first) + R (second) + C2 = A (since the thousands digit is A).\n\nSo let's write equations for each column:\n\n1. Units: D = D \u2192 okay.\n\n2. Tens column:\n\nA + E = I + 10*C1 \u2192 (1)\n\n3. Hundreds column:\n\nM + A + C1 = M + 10*C2 \u2192 subtract M: A + C1 = 10*C2 \u2192 (2)\n\n4. Thousands column:\n\nR + C2 = A \u2192 (3)\n\nAlso, since the second partial product is R A E (the product of MAD * B), which is a three-digit number R A E. So:\n\nMAD * B = R A E \u2192 (4)\n\nAdditionally, E is 1, as established earlier.\n\nSo E =1.\n\nLet me substitute E =1 into the equations.\n\nEquation (1): A +1 = I +10*C1 \u2192 I = A +1 -10*C1.\n\nEquation (2): A + C1 =10*C2 \u2192 since A and C1 are digits (A is 0-9, C1 is 0 or 1 or maybe 2? Because A is a digit, adding 1 (E=1) gives at most A+1 \u2264 9+1=10, so C1 can be 0 or 1.\n\nWait in equation (1), the maximum A +1 can be 9+1=10, so C1 can be 0 or 1.\n\nCase 1: C1 =0.\n\nThen equation (1) \u2192 I = A +1 -0 \u2192 I =A+1.\n\nEquation (2) \u2192 A +0 =10*C2 \u2192 since A is a digit (0-9), 10*C2 must equal A. So possible only if A is 0 or 10, but A is a digit, so A=0 and C2=0. But A can't be zero because AMID's thousands digit is A, which can't be zero. So this case is invalid unless A=0, which is invalid.\n\nCase 2: C1 =1.\n\nThen equation (1): I =A +1 -10*1 =A -9.\n\nSince I must be a digit (0-9), A -9 \u22650 \u2192 A \u22659. But A is a digit (0-9), so A must be 9, making I=0.\n\nEquation (2): A +1 =10*C2 \u2192 A+1 must be divisible by 10. Since A=9, then 9+1=10 \u2192 C2=1.\n\nSo C2=1.\n\nEquation (3): R + C2 = A \u2192 R +1 = A \u2192 since A=9 \u2192 R =8.\n\nSo from this, we have:\n\nE=1,\n\nA=9,\n\nI =0,\n\nC1=1,\n\nC2=1,\n\nR =8.\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nNow, let's see what we have:\n\nFrom the second partial product:\n\nMAD * B = R A E \u2192 R is 8, A is9, E is1 \u2192 8 9 1 \u2192 so 891.\n\nSo MAD * B = 891.\n\nAlso, the thousands column equation gives R + C2 = A \u2192 8+1=9 \u2192 correct.\n\nNow, the total product is AMID \u2192 A=9, so it's 9 M I D \u2192 9 M 0 D (since I=0).\n\nThe total product is also equal to (MAD)*(BE). Since BE is B followed by E (1). So BE is 10*B +1.\n\nThe total product is (100*M +10*A + D)*(10*B +1) = 9000 + 100*M + 0*10 + D = 9000 +100*M + D.\n\nSo:\n\n(100*M +90 + D)*(10*B +1) = 9000 +100*M + D.\n\nHmm, but also, since MAD * B = 891, so (100*M +90 + D)*B =891.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n(100*M +90 + D)*B =891 \u2192 Let me call the MAD number as X = 100*M +90 + D.\n\nSo X*B =891.\n\nWe need to find integers M (digit 1-9, since it's the first digit of MAD), D (digit 0-9), B (digit 1-9), such that X*B =891, and also (X)*(10*B +1) = 9000 +100*M + D.\n\nAlso, X is a three-digit number: 100*M +90 + D \u2192 between 100*1 +90 +0 =190 and 999 (if M=9, D=9: 900+90+9=999). But since X*B=891, X must be a factor of 891, and B must be an integer between 1 and 9.\n\nLet me factorize 891 to find possible factors:\n\n891 \u00f7 3 = 297 \u2192 3*297.\n\n297 \u00f73=99 \u2192 3*3*99.\n\n99=9*11 \u2192 so 891= 3^4 *11.\n\nSo factors of 891:\n\n1, 3, 9, 11, 27, 33, 81, 99, 297, 891.\n\nLooking for three-digit factors X (between 100 and 999) and B (1-9). So possible X and B pairs:\n\nCheck each possible X which is a three-digit factor of 891:\n\nPossible X:\n\n11 is two-digit, so next is 27 (two-digit), 33 (two-digit), 81 (two-digit). 99 (two-digit). Then 111? No, but factors are only up to 297 and 891.\n\nWait 3^4 *11 is 81*11 = 891. So factors:\n\nPossible three-digit factors:\n\n- 11 \u00d7 81 = 891 \u2192 but 11 is two-digit, 81 is two-digit. Not helpful.\n\nWait 891 divided by 9 is 99 \u2192 9\u00d799=891. 99 is two-digit. 891 divided by 33 is 27 \u2192 no. Hmm.\n\nWait 891 divided by 27 is 33 \u2192 no. Wait, perhaps 891 divided by 297 is 3 \u2192 so 297 \u00d73=891. So 297 is a three-digit factor. So possible X=297 and B=3.\n\nOr X= 99 \u00d79 \u2192 but 99 is two-digit. Alternatively, X= 891 and B=1, but 891 is three-digit. Let's see:\n\nPossible three-digit factors of 891:\n\n297 \u00d73 =891 \u2192 X=297, B=3.\n\nAlso, 891 \u00d71 =891 \u2192 X=891, B=1.\n\nAnother three-digit factor is 891 itself. So possibilities:\n\nCase 1: X=297, B=3.\n\nCase 2: X=891, B=1.\n\nCheck these possibilities.\n\nFirst, case 1: X=297, B=3.\n\nSo MAD = 297 \u2192 M=2, A=9 (matches our earlier A=9), D=7.\n\nThen, check if this fits into the equations.\n\nSo M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3.\n\nThen, the second partial product is 297 *3= 891 \u2192 which is R A E \u2192 8 9 1 \u2192 R=8, which matches our earlier R=8 (from equation R= A-1=9-1=8? Wait earlier we had R + C2 =A \u2192 R+1=9 \u2192 R=8, yes. So that's okay.\n\nNow check the total product.\n\nTotal product is (297)*(BE). BE is B followed by E (which is 1). B=3, so BE is 31.\n\n297 \u00d731 = ?\n\nCalculate that: 297 *30 =8910, plus 297*1=297 \u2192 total 8910 +297 =9207.\n\nThe total product is supposed to be AMID \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7 \u2192 9 2 0 7 \u2192 9207. Which matches exactly.\n\nSo this works. Now check the options. The options are given as four digits, probably M, A, D, B.\n\nIn this case, M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3. Looking at the options:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9? No.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2, etc. Not matching.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2, no.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9? Not.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 also not.\n\nWait, none of these options have M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3. Wait, the options given are A)9 2 0 0, B)9 2 0 9, C)9 2 0 1, D)9 2 0 7, E)9 2 2 2. Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, the options are four numbers each, but maybe the letters are M, A, D, I? Because the problem's question is \"decipher the following multiplication table\", and the options list four digits. The question might be asking for the values of M, A, D, B, but the options have four numbers. Wait the problem says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options are labeled with four numbers. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait the question is \"Decipher the following multiplication table: [the setup], and the options are A to E, each with four numbers. The problem is probably asking for the values of M, A, D, B in order. Let me see the options:\n\nOption D is 9 2 0 7. Hmm, but in my case M is 2, so the first digit would be 2, but option D starts with 9. Wait, maybe I messed up the order?\n\nWait, maybe the options are M, A, D, B. Let's see.\n\nIn my solution:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7, B=3 \u2192 so the numbers would be 2,9,7,3. But none of the options have those.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the assumption. Let me check the other case.\n\nCase 2: X=891, B=1.\n\nSo MAD = 891 \u2192 M=8, A=9, D=1.\n\nThen, B=1. But B is part of the multiplier BE, where E=1, so BE would be 11. But B can't be 1 here because in this case, the second partial product is MAD * B =891 *1=891. So the second partial product R A E is 8 9 1. So R=8, A=9, E=1. Which fits.\n\nNow, the total product would be 891 *11 = 9801. But AMID would be A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1 \u2192 9801. Which matches.\n\nSo in this case, the values are:\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1, B=1.\n\nSo the four numbers would be M=8, A=9, D=1, B=1 \u2192 8 9 1 1. None of the options have that either. The options given are:\n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=0 \u2192 but B can't be 0.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 B=9.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 B=1.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 B=7.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 B=2.\n\nHmm, so in my first case, the values were M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, which doesn't match any options. The second case M=8, A=9, D=1, B=1 \u2192 which would correspond to option C if the order is M, A, D, B. Because option C is 9 2 0 1. Wait no, the first number would be M. If M is 8 in case 2, then it's 8, 9, 1, 1 \u2192 not in options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another case I didn't consider.\n\nWait, let's check if there are other factors. Let me re-examine the factor pairs.\n\n891 divided by 3 is 297 \u2192 so (X=297, B=3).\n\nDivided by 9 \u2192 891/9=99 \u2192 X=99 (two-digit, so no).\n\nDivided by 11 \u2192 891/11=81 \u2192 two-digit.\n\nDivided by 27 \u2192 891/27=33 \u2192 two-digit.\n\nDivided by 33 \u2192 27 \u2192 two-digit.\n\nDivided by 81 \u2192 11 \u2192 two-digit.\n\nDivided by 99 \u21929 \u2192 two-digit.\n\nDivided by 297 \u21923 \u2192 three-digit X=297, B=3.\n\nDivided by 891 \u21921 \u2192 three-digit X=891, B=1.\n\nSo those are the only possibilities for three-digit X.\n\nHmm, but the options given don't match either of these. So perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.\n\nWait, maybe I missed a possible case where C1 is 2? Let me revisit the equations.\n\nEarlier, I considered C1 can be 0 or 1 because in equation (1), A + E (E=1) can be up to 9+1=10, so the maximum carryover is 1. But wait, perhaps there's another scenario where:\n\nWait in equation (1): A + E = I + 10*C1. The maximum A+E can be is 9+1=10, so C1 can be 0 or 1. So no, that part is correct.\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming E=1. Let me recheck that.\n\nThe first partial product is MAD * E = MAD. So unless E=1, that can't happen. Because if E is 1, then yes. Otherwise, if E is 0, then the first partial product would be 0, which can't be. So E must be 1.\n\nSo that's correct.\n\nHmm. So in the first case, where X=297, B=3 gives us the total product 9207, which is AMID \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. So the letters are:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, E=1, R=8, I=0.\n\nNow, looking at the options, the options are four digits each, perhaps representing M, A, D, B?\n\nIf so, then in this case, the numbers would be 2 (M),9 (A),7 (D),3 (B). The options don't have this combination. The closest is option D:9 2 0 7, which would be M=9, A=2, D=0, B=7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the options are M, A, D, I? Because in the options, the fourth number is I? Let me see the options again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 maybe M=9, A=2, D=0, I=0.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=9.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=1.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, I=7.\n\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=2, I=2.\n\nWait, perhaps the question's options are M, A, D, I? Because the product is AMID, so those are the four letters. The problem says \"decipher the following multiplication table\", so perhaps the question is asking for the values of M, A, D, I? The options have four digits each, so that would make sense. The letters in the options could be M, A, D, I.\n\nIn my first case, the values are M=2, A=9, D=7, I=0. So that would be 2 9 7 0. None of the options have that. The second case (X=891) gives M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0 (since AMID is 9801 \u2192 I=0). So 8 9 1 0, but options don't have that either.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption that E=1. Let me think again.\n\nWait the first partial product is MAD multiplied by E, and the result is written as MAD. So the multiplication by E must not change the number. The only possibility is that E is 1, since multiplying by 1 leaves it the same. Any other digit would change the number. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. The problem's options don't seem to match the cases I found. Maybe I missed another case?\n\nWait let's see. Let me think of the second case again where X=891 and B=1. Then:\n\nMAD is 891 \u2192 M=8, A=9, D=1.\n\nB=1, E=1 \u2192 BE is 11.\n\nTotal product is 891 \u00d711 =9801 \u2192 AMID is 9 8 0 1 \u2192 A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1.\n\nSo M=8, A=9, D=1, I=0. If the options are for M, A, D, I, then it would be 8 9 1 0. Not in the options.\n\nHmm. The options given are all starting with 9 in the first digit except option A which is 9 2 0 0. Wait option B is 9 2 0 9, etc. So maybe the question's options are in the order M, A, D, B. Let me see:\n\nIn the first case (297*31=9207):\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7, B=3 \u2192 so M,A,D,B \u2192 2,9,7,3 \u2192 not in options.\n\nSecond case (891 *11=9801):\n\nM=8, A=9, D=1, B=1 \u2192 8,9,1,1 \u2192 not in options.\n\nHmm. The options given are:\n\nA) 9 2 0 0 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=0 \u2192 but B can't be 0.\n\nB) 9 2 0 9 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=9 \u2192 check if possible.\n\nLet me try with option B's values: M=9, A=2, D=0, B=9.\n\nThen, let's see if this works.\n\nE is still 1.\n\nFirst partial product: MAD * E = 920 *1 =920 \u2192 which matches the first partial product.\n\nSecond partial product: MAD * B =920 *9 = 8280 \u2192 but since it's three-digit? Wait 920 *9 is 8280, which is four digits, but the second partial product is supposed to be R A E (three digits). So this is impossible. Thus option B is invalid.\n\nOption C: 9 2 0 1 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=1.\n\nThen, first partial product is 920 *1 =920.\n\nSecond partial product is 920 *1 =920 \u2192 but shifted left gives 9200. Adding 920 +9200 = 10120, which is a five-digit number, but the total should be AMID (four-digit). So invalid.\n\nOption D: 9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=7.\n\nFirst partial product: 920 *1=920.\n\nSecond partial product: 920 *7 =6440 \u2192 which is four-digit, but the partial product should be three-digit (R A E). So that's four digits, impossible. So invalid.\n\nOption E: 9 2 2 2 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=2, B=2.\n\nFirst partial product: 922*1=922.\n\nSecond partial product: 922*2=1844 \u2192 four digits again, which is too long.\n\nHmm, none of the options are working. This suggests that perhaps my initial approach is wrong.\n\nWait maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the first partial product is the same as MAD. Let me check the multiplication again.\n\nThe problem's multiplication is:\n\n   M A D\n\nx   B E\n\n------------\n\n   M A D   (this is the first partial product, from multiplying by E)\n\nR A E      (this is the second partial product, from multiplying by B, shifted left by one)\n\n------------\n\nA M I D\n\nAh! Wait, perhaps the second partial product is R A E shifted left by one, so when written, it's actually R A E 0? So when adding the two partial products (MAD and RAE0), the total is AMID.\n\nWait in my previous analysis, that's what I did, but maybe the second partial product's written as R A E but actually it's R A E shifted left, so it's R A E *10, which is R A E 0. So the second partial product must be a three-digit number R A E, so when multiplied by B, MAD * B must be R A E, a three-digit number. So that requires that MAD * B is three digits, so B must be small enough so that MAD * B is three digits.\n\nIn the first case I considered, when MAD was 297 and B=3 \u2192 297*3=891, which is three digits. So that works.\n\nBut in the options given, none of them fit. So maybe the question has a different setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nWait let's try to consider option D: 9 2 0 7 \u2192 M=9, A=2, D=0, B=7.\n\nLet me try plugging in these values:\n\nM=9, A=2, D=0 \u2192 MAD is 920.\n\nB=7, E=1 (since first partial product must be MAD).\n\nThen, first partial product is 920 \u00d71 =920.\n\nSecond partial product is 920 \u00d77 =6440 \u2192 but this is four digits. However, the problem's second partial product is written as R A E. So 6440 would have to be R A E followed by a zero, but that's four digits. So the written partial product would be 6440 \u2192 but the problem says it's R A E (three digits). So that's impossible. Thus option D is invalid.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait maybe I messed up the order of the letters in the final product. The final product is AMID. If in the first case (M=2, A=9, D=7, B=3), then the total is 9207, so A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. So the letters would be A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. So the four letters A, M, I, D are 9, 2, 0, 7. The options are given as four numbers, perhaps in that order: A, M, I, D. Let's see.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=0 \u2192 but D should be7.\n\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 D=9, not.\n\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 D=1.\n\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 yes, this would be A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. Which matches the first case's result.\n\nAh! So the question's options are the values of A, M, I, D in order. So the four numbers are A, M, I, D.\n\nIn the first case, those values are 9,2,0,7 \u2192 which matches option D.\n\nAh! That must be it. The options are A, M, I, D.\n\nSo the correct answer would be option D)9 2 0 7.\n\nLet me verify this again:\n\nIf the options are A, M, I, D:\n\nIn the first case (M=2, A=9, I=0, D=7), the sequence is A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7 \u2192 exactly option D.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the multiplication table problem, we start by noting the structure:\n\n   M A D\nx   B E\n------------\n   M A D  (first partial product: MAD \u00d7 E)\nR A E     (second partial product: MAD \u00d7 B shifted left)\n------------\nA M I D\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **First Partial Product (MAD \u00d7 E):** This must equal MAD, implying \\( E = 1 \\).\n2. **Second Partial Product (MAD \u00d7 B):** This results in a three-digit number \\( R A 1 \\) (since \\( E = 1 \\)), so \\( \\text{MAD} \\times B = \\text{RA1} \\).\n3. **Total Product (AMID):** This is the sum of the partial products: \\( \\text{MAD} + (\\text{RA1} \\times 10) = \\text{AMID} \\).\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Equation Setup:**  \n  \\[\n  \\text{MAD} \\times (10B + 1) = \\text{AMID}\n  \\]\n  Substituting \\( \\text{MAD} = 100M + 10A + D \\) and \\( \\text{AMID} = 1000A + 100M + 10I + D \\), we derive constraints through digit-by-digit addition and multiplication.\n\n- **Critical Constraints:**  \n  - The second partial product \\( \\text{RA1} \\) implies \\( D \\times B \\mod 10 = 1 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this multiplication table question. The problem is a multiplication where M A D times B E gives A M I D. The options are different numbers for the letters A, M, I, D. Hmm. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup is a 3-digit number (MAD) multiplied by a 2-digit number (BE) resulting in a 4-digit number (AMID). Wait, but wait, the multiplication table shows the partial products: MAD (which is the same as the original number, so maybe that's the result of multiplying by the units digit of BE?), then RAE (probably the product of multiplying by the tens digit, shifted left), and when added together they give AMID. \n\nSo, the multiplication would be:\n\n   M A D\nx   B E\n--------\n   M A D   (This is MAD \u00d7 E)\n+ R A E    (This is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted one position to the left because it's the tens place)\n--------\n  A M I D\n\nSo, the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD. Wait, that seems strange. If multiplying by E gives the same number, then E must be 1. Because anything multiplied by 1 stays the same. So E = 1. But let me check the options. Looking at the options given, the second number in each is for A, but maybe I need to check.\n\nWait, the options are for the letters A, M, I, D. Let's see the options. The options are A)9 2 0 0 (so A=9, M=2, I=0, D=0?), but that might not make sense. Wait, perhaps the options are ordered as A, M, I, D. So each option is a four-digit number where the first digit is A's value, second M, third I, fourth D. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=0\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=9\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=1\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=2, D=2\n\nHmm, so the first letters in the options are all 9, so A must be 9. That's a key point. So A is 9.\n\nNow, let's proceed. Since E is part of the multiplier BE, and the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD, so E must be 1. Because multiplying by E gives the same number. So E=1.\n\nSo the multiplier is B1. Because the second digit is E, which is 1. So BE is B1.\n\nNow, the second partial product is RAE, which is MAD \u00d7 B (since B is the tens digit, so multiplied by B and shifted left by one). So when we multiply MAD by B, we get RAE. Then when we add MAD (the first partial product) shifted appropriately? Wait, actually, the way multiplication works, the first partial product is E \u00d7 MAD (so units digit), and the second is B \u00d7 MAD shifted left by one (tens digit). So when adding, the total is (B\u00d710 + E) \u00d7 MAD = A M I D.\n\nWait, but the sum of the two partial products (MAD + RAE shifted left by one) must equal AMID. Let me write that numerically.\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet MAD = 100*M + 10*A + D\nBE = 10*B + E\nThe product is (10*B + E)*(100*M + 10*A + D) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nBut also, the partial products are:\n\nFirst partial product: (E)*(MAD) = MAD \u2192 so E*MAD = MAD \u2192 E must be 1, as before.\n\nSecond partial product: (B)*(MAD) \u00d7 10 \u2192 because shifted left by one (since B is in the tens place). So that's B*MAD*10. \n\nAdding those together: MAD + B*MAD*10 = (1 + 10*B)*MAD = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nHmm. Let me see:\n\nSo (1 + 10*B)*MAD = AMID (the final product). \n\nBut since the partial products are MAD and RAE (shifted), their sum should be AMID. Let me also note that the second partial product (B*MAD) gives RAE as a three-digit number. So B*MAD must be a three-digit number, RAE. \n\nGiven that A is 9, as per the options, let's plug that in.\n\nSo A = 9.\n\nFirst, since E=1, so the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 1 = MAD. \n\nNow, the second partial product is B*MAD = RAE. Since RAE is a three-digit number, and B is a digit (from 1 to 9, but since BE is a two-digit number, B can't be 0). Let me think of possible values for B.\n\nAlso, the final product is AMID, which is a four-digit number starting with A=9, so AMID is between 9000 and 9999. Since the multiplier is (BE) = B1 (since E is 1), and MAD is a three-digit number. So (B1)*(MAD) = AMID (four-digit). \n\nLet me consider possible values for B. Let's see, since the product is four digits, the multiplier B1 (which is 10B +1) multiplied by MAD (three digits) must give a four-digit number. So (10B +1)*MAD \u2248 1000 to 9999. Let me see possible B values. \n\nThe smallest possible MAD is 100, so (10B+1)*100 \u2265 1000 \u2192 10B+1 \u226510 \u2192 B\u22651 (since B is at least 1). The maximum possible MAD is 999, so (10B+1)*999 \u2264 9999 \u2192 10B+1 \u2264 10 \u2192 10B \u22649 \u2192 B=0, but B can't be 0 because it's the first digit of a two-digit number. Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the upper limit is when B is higher. Wait maybe I miscalculated. Let me think again. Wait, (10B+1)*MAD must be at least 9000 (since AMID starts with 9, so 9000 or higher). Let me see possible B values. Let me think of B as 8 or 9? Let's see:\n\nSuppose B is 9. Then the multiplier is 91. So 91 \u00d7 MAD = AMID (four digits starting with 9). Let's see, 91 \u00d7 MAD must be between 9000 and 9999. Then MAD would be between 9000/91 \u2248 98.9, so 99 up to 9999/91 \u2248 109.8. So MAD would have to be around 100. But the second partial product (B*MAD = 9*MAD) would be 9*MAD. Let's see if that gives a three-digit number. If MAD is 100, then 9\u00d7100=900, which is three digits. So possible. \n\nAlternatively, if B is 8, then 81 \u00d7 MAD must be \u22659000 \u2192 MAD \u2265 9000/81 \u2248 111.1 \u2192 112. So MAD is three digits, so possible. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is 9. Let me see if that works.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. Let me note that in the final product AMID, the first digit is A=9, so the product is between 9000 and 9999.\n\nAlso, since the first partial product is MAD \u00d71 = MAD, and the second is B*MAD \u00d710. So adding them gives:\n\nMAD + 10*(B*MAD) = (1 + 10B)*MAD = AMID.\n\nBut AMID is 9000 + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the partial products and the sum.\n\nLet me consider the digits in the final product. The first digit is A=9. Let's look at the addition of the two partial products:\n\nThe first partial product (MAD) is a three-digit number. The second partial product (RAE) shifted left by one is a four-digit number (since RAE is three digits, shifted left makes it four digits). Wait no: RAE is three digits, so shifted left becomes a four-digit number. Adding to the first partial product (three digits) gives a four-digit number. \n\nWait, let's write it out:\n\nFirst partial product:      M A D\nSecond partial product:  R A E (shifted left by one \u2192 becomes R A E 0)\nAdding them gives: A M I D\n\nWait, but the sum is AMID. Wait, but the second partial product shifted left would have the last digit in the tens place. Wait, perhaps I should align the numbers properly:\n\nLet me write it vertically:\n\n        M A D\n      x   B E\n      --------\n        M A D   (this is MAD \u00d7 E, which is MAD \u00d71)\n      + R A E   (this is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one digit, so actually R A E 0)\n      --------\n      A M I D\n\nWait, but adding M A D (three digits) and R A E 0 (four digits) must give a four-digit number. So the total sum's thousands digit comes from the carryover or the R A E 0's thousands digit. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second partial product is written as R A E shifted left, so adding:\n\n      M A D\n    + R A E 0\n    ---------\n    A M I D\n\nSo the sum must be a four-digit number. Let me see the addition column by column.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit (units place):\n\nFirst partial product's units digit: D\nSecond partial product's units digit (since shifted left): 0 (from the E's position being shifted to the tens place)\nSo the units digit of the total is D + 0 = D. But the final product's units digit is D. So that's okay, no problem.\n\nNext, the tens place:\n\nFirst partial product's tens digit: A\nSecond's tens digit: E (since the second partial product's units digit is 0, but the E is now in the tens place after shifting? Wait, let me think again. Wait, the second partial product RAE is written shifted left by one, so the digits are R (hundreds place), A (tens), E (units) before shifting. After shifting left by one, it becomes R (thousands), A (hundreds), E (tens), and 0 (units). Wait no, shifting left one digit multiplies by 10. So RAE as a number is R\u00d7100 + A\u00d710 + E. Shifting left by one digit makes it (RAE)*10 = R\u00d71000 + A\u00d7100 + E\u00d710. So when adding to MAD (which is M\u00d7100 + A\u00d710 + D), the total is:\n\nMAD + (RAE)*10 = (M\u00d7100 + A\u00d710 + D) + (R\u00d71000 + A\u00d7100 + E\u00d710) = R\u00d71000 + (A\u00d7100 + M\u00d7100) + (E\u00d710 + A\u00d710) + D.\n\nWait, but the total is A M I D. Let me see:\n\nLet me write each digit position:\n\nUnits place:\nD (from first partial) + 0 (from second partial) = D. So the units digit matches, so no carryover here.\n\nTens place:\nA (from first) + E (from second's tens place, since RAE shifted is R A E 0, so the E is in the tens place? Wait, the second partial product after shift has its units digit as 0, the tens digit is E, hundreds is A, thousands R. So in the tens place of the sum, it's (A from first partial's tens) + E (from second's shifted tens place). So the total in the tens digit is A + E. But the final product's tens digit is I. So A + E must equal I or I plus 10 if there's a carryover from the units. But units digit didn't have any carryover since D + 0 = D, so no. So A + E = I (mod 10). \n\nHmm, so I = (A + E) mod 10, and possibly a carryover here. Let's note that.\n\nHundreds place: \n\nIn the first partial product, the hundreds digit is M. The second partial product's hundreds digit (from shifted RAE) is A (since shifted RAE has A in the hundreds place). So adding those gives M + A. But also, there could be a carryover from the tens place. Let's say there's a carryover of 'c1' from the tens to hundreds. So the total at hundreds place is (M + A) + c1. The hundreds digit in the final product is M (since AMID has M in the hundreds place). So:\n\n(M + A + c1) mod 10 = M. \n\nSo (A + c1) mod 10 = 0. Which implies that A + c1 must be a multiple of 10. Since A is 9 (from the options), then 9 + c1 \u2261 0 mod10 \u2192 c1 must be 1. Therefore, the carryover from the tens place must be 1, so that 9 + 1 =10 \u2192 mod10 gives 0. \n\nTherefore, the carryover from the tens to hundreds is 1. Which implies that in the tens place, A + E must be at least 10, so that the addition gives a carryover of 1. Since A is 9, then 9 + E must be \u226510 \u2192 E \u22651. But earlier we concluded E=1, which would give 9+1=10, so yes, that works. So I = (9+1) mod10 \u2192 I=0, with a carryover of 1. \n\nSo I must be 0. Looking at the options, the third digit (I) in all options except E is 0. So options A, B, C, D have I as 0. Option E has I=2, so that can be ruled out. So the answer is among A, B, C, D. \n\nSo I=0. \n\nSo now, moving on. Let's check the hundreds place. Since c1 is 1, the sum in hundreds is M + A + 1. The hundreds digit in the final product is M, so (M +9 +1) mod10 = M \u2192 (M +10) mod10 = M \u2192 0 mod10 = M mod10? Wait, (M+10) mod10 = M mod10. So that holds for any M. But also, there might be a carryover here. Let me see: the total sum in the hundreds place is M +9 +1 = M +10. So this would produce a digit of (M+10) mod10 in the hundreds place, which is M mod10, so that matches. However, the carryover from the hundreds to the thousands place would be (M+10)/10, which is floor((M+10)/10). Since M is a digit (0-9), M+10 can be from 10 to 19, so the carryover is 1 or 2? Wait, M is between 0-9. So the maximum is 9 +10 =19 \u2192 carryover of 1 (since 19 divided by 10 is 1.9 \u2192 floor is 1). Wait, 19 gives a carryover of 1 (because 19 mod10 is 9, so 19 = 10*1 +9). So the carryover is 1. \n\nSo the thousands place comes from the thousands digit of the second partial product (R) plus any carryover from the hundreds. \n\nThe thousands place of the total is A (the first digit of AMID is 9). The thousands digit comes from R (from the second partial product's thousands place) plus the carryover from hundreds (which is 1). So R +1 must equal A (which is 9). So R +1 =9 \u2192 R=8. \n\nSo R is 8. \n\nNow, let's recap so far:\n\nE =1 (from first partial product)\n\nA=9 (from options)\n\nI=0 (from tens place analysis)\n\nR=8 (from thousands place)\n\nNow, moving on. \n\nThe second partial product is B*MAD = RAE, which is 8 A E. Since A=9 and E=1, so RAE is 8 9 1. So B*MAD = 891.\n\nWait, so B multiplied by MAD equals 891. \n\nSo B \u00d7 MAD = 891. \n\nWe need to find B and MAD such that this holds, with MAD being a three-digit number (M, A=9, D). Also, since B is a digit (1-9), and the multiplier BE is B1. \n\nSo, let's note that 891 divided by B must be an integer (since MAD is an integer). So B must be a divisor of 891. Let's factor 891 to find possible B values.\n\nFactorizing 891: 891 \u00f7 3 = 297, then 297 \u00f73 =99, \u00f73=33, \u00f73=11. So 891 = 3^4 \u00d7 11. \n\nPossible divisors (since B is a single digit between 1-9):\n\nFactors of 891 that are single-digit: 1, 3, 9, 11 is too big. Wait, 3^4 is 81, but 81 is two digits. So possible B values are 1, 3, 9, 9? Wait 891 \u00f7 9 is 99. Let me see:\n\nPossible B values (divisors of 891):\n\n1: 891 /1=891 \u2192 MAD would be 891, but A is 9, so the second digit is 9, which matches. But then D would be 1. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, but MAD is a three-digit number with A=9, so MAD is M 9 D. So if MAD is 891, then M=8, D=1. Let's see if this works. Let's check if this is a possible solution.\n\nAlternatively B=3: 891 \u00f73 = 297 \u2192 MAD would be 297. Then M is 2, D=7. \n\nB=9: 891 \u00f79=99 \u2192 MAD=99. But that's two digits. So invalid, since MAD must be three digits. \n\nWait, 891 divided by 9 is 99. So that would make MAD=99, which is two digits, so that's not acceptable. So B can't be 9. \n\nB= 11? No, not a digit. \n\nWait, other factors? Let's see 891 \u00f7 11 is 81, but B must be a digit. So possible B is 1, 3, 9, but 9 gives MAD too small. \n\nWait, 891 \u00f7 3 = 297 \u2192 MAD is 297. That works. Let me see.\n\nSo possibilities:\n\nCase 1: B=1 \u2192 MAD=891. Then M is 8, D is 1. Let's see if that works with other constraints.\n\nCase 2: B=3 \u2192 MAD=297 \u2192 M=2, D=7.\n\nLet me check each case.\n\nFirst, Case1: B=1, MAD=891 (so M=8, A=9, D=1). Let's see:\n\nThe final product is AMID. Since A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1 \u2192 AMID should be 9 8 0 1 \u2192 9801.\n\nThe multiplier is BE = B1 \u2192 B=1, so BE is 11. \n\nSo 891 \u00d711 = 9801. Let's compute 891 \u00d711: 891\u00d710=8910 +891 = 9801. That works. \n\nNow check the partial products:\n\nFirst partial: 891 \u00d71 = 891 (matches M A D)\n\nSecond partial: 891 \u00d71 = 891, shifted left \u2192 8910. So written as R A E (the RAE would be 8 9 1 (since R=8, A=9, E=1). So when shifted left, it's 8910. Adding 891 +8910 gives 9801, which is AMID (9801). \n\nSo that works. But looking at the options, the D in this case is 1, so the fourth digit. The options where D is 1 would be option C (9 2 0 1) but here M is 8, which would not be in the options. Wait, the options for M are second digit. Looking back at the options:\n\nThe options are A)9 2 0 0 (A=9, M=2, I=0, D=0) \u2192 no.\n\nWait in this case, M would be 8, so the second digit is 8, but none of the options have M as 8. The options' M is 2 in all except perhaps? Wait all options have M as 2 except none. Wait all options for the second digit (M) are 2. Let me check again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 9 (A) 2 (M) 0 (I) 0 (D)\n\nB)9 2 0 9\n\nC)9 2 0 1\n\nD)9 2 0 7\n\nE)9 2 2 2\n\nAh right, so all options have M=2. So in the case where M is 8, that's not possible. So this case is invalid because the options require M=2. Therefore, this case must be rejected. \n\nSo moving to case2: B=3, MAD=297 \u2192 M=2, A=9, D=7. \n\nSo then, the final product should be AMID \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. So AMID is 9207. \n\nThe multiplier BE is B1 \u2192 B=3, so BE is 31. \n\nCalculating 297 \u00d731: \n\n297 \u00d7 30 = 8910; 297 \u00d71 = 297. Total is 8910 +297 = 9207. Which matches AMID (9207). \n\nNow check the partial products:\n\nFirst partial: 297 \u00d71 (E=1) \u2192 297 (MAD \u2192 M=2, A=9, D=7 \u2192 correct).\n\nSecond partial product: 297 \u00d7 B (3) \u2192 297\u00d73 = 891. Which would be RAE. R is 8, A=9, E=1 \u2192 RAE is 891. So that's correct. Then shifted left (\u00d710) gives 8910. Adding 297 +8910 =9207, which matches. \n\nNow, checking the letters:\n\nA=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. Which corresponds to option D: 9 2 0 7. So that's option D. \n\nWait but let's check if other constraints are met. \n\nIn the thousands place: R +1 =9 \u2192 R is 8, which matches (from 891, R is the first digit, 8). \n\nAlso, the value of I is 0, which comes from A + E (9+1=10 \u2192 I is 0 with carryover 1). \n\nSo all the conditions are satisfied here. \n\nNow check the other options. Let's see option D is 9 2 0 7. That would fit this scenario. \n\nWhat about other possibilities? Let's see if B can be another value. \n\nWait, 891 divided by B must be MAD. Are there any other B's?\n\nWait 891 divided by 9 gives 99, which is two digits. So no. \n\nWhat about B= 9? That gives MAD=99, which is two digits, so invalid. \n\nB= 11? Not a digit. \n\nSo the only possible B is 3 and 1. But B=1 gives M=8 which is not in the options. So the only possible solution is B=3, which gives M=2, D=7 \u2192 option D. \n\nWait, but let me check another possible B. Wait, what if B is a different number? For example, maybe B is 7? Let me see. \n\nWait, but 891 divided by 7 is 127.285... which is not an integer. So no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the second partial product must be exactly RAE. Let me think again. \n\nWait, when we compute B \u00d7 MAD, that product must be RAE. So in the case of B=3 and MAD=297, 297 \u00d73 = 891 \u2192 RAE is 891, so R=8, A=9, E=1. Which matches. \n\nAnother check: in the thousands place of the final product, AMID is 9207. So the thousands digit is 9 (A), which comes from R (8) plus carryover 1 (from hundreds place). 8+1=9, so that's correct. \n\nNow, looking at the options, D is 9 2 0 7, so that's correct. \n\nWait but let me check option D's D is 7, which is correct here. \n\nOther options: Option B has D=9. Let me see if that's possible. Suppose D=9. Then in the case where B= something else. But according to our analysis, the only valid scenario is option D. \n\nAlternatively, let me check if there's another possible value for B where M=2. Suppose, for instance, that B= something else. Wait, but B has to be such that B*MAD = RAE, and R is 8. \n\nWait, if B*MAD = 891, and M is 2, then MAD is 2xx (with A=9). So MAD is 29D. \n\nSo 29D \u00d7 B = 891. \n\nWait, but in the case where B=3, 297 \u00d73=891. \n\nAlternatively, if B= something else? Let me see: \n\nSuppose B= 3 is the only possible. \n\nSo yes, that's the only way. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D) 9 2 0 7. \n\nBut let me check the other options to make sure. \n\nOption C is 9 2 0 1 (D=1). That would mean in our case, D=1, but in that case, the final product would have D=1. But in that case, the MAD would be 291 (since M=2, A=9, D=1). Then B*MAD must be RAE = 891. So 291 \u00d7 B = 891 \u2192 B= 891/291 \u22483.06, which is not an integer. So that's not possible. \n\nOption B is D=9. Let's see: D=9 would mean MAD ends with 9. So MAD is 299. Then B*299=891 \u2192 B= 891/299 \u22483. So 299 \u00d73=897. Not 891. So no. \n\nOption A is D=0. So MAD is 290. B\u00d7290 = 891 \u2192 891/290\u22483.07. Not integer. \n\nThus, only option D works. \n\nSo the answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves a multiplication of a three-digit number (MAD) by a two-digit number (BE) resulting in a four-digit number (AMID). The partial products are MAD (from multiplying by E) and RAE shifted left (from multiplying by B). \n\n1. **Determine E**: The first partial product (MAD \u00d7 E) equals MAD, so E must be 1.\n2. **Identify A**: All options start with A=9, so A=9.\n3. **Analyze Tens Place**: The tens digit of the sum (I) comes from A + E (9 + 1 = 10), so I=0 with a carryover of 1.\n4. **Thousands Place**: The thousands digit (A=9) requires R + 1 = 9, so R=8.\n5. **Solve for B and MAD**: The second partial product (B \u00d7 MAD = RAE = 891).

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I have this multiplication table question. The problem is a multiplication where M A D times B E gives A M I D. The options are different numbers for the letters A, M, I, D. Hmm. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup is a 3-digit number (MAD) multiplied by a 2-digit number (BE) resulting in a 4-digit number (AMID). Wait, but wait, the multiplication table shows the partial products: MAD (which is the same as the original number, so maybe that's the result of multiplying by the units digit of BE?), then RAE (probably the product of multiplying by the tens digit, shifted left), and when added together they give AMID. \n\nSo, the multiplication would be:\n\n   M A D\nx   B E\n--------\n   M A D   (This is MAD \u00d7 E)\n+ R A E    (This is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted one position to the left because it's the tens place)\n--------\n  A M I D\n\nSo, the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD. Wait, that seems strange. If multiplying by E gives the same number, then E must be 1. Because anything multiplied by 1 stays the same. So E = 1. But let me check the options. Looking at the options given, the second number in each is for A, but maybe I need to check.\n\nWait, the options are for the letters A, M, I, D. Let's see the options. The options are A)9 2 0 0 (so A=9, M=2, I=0, D=0?), but that might not make sense. Wait, perhaps the options are ordered as A, M, I, D. So each option is a four-digit number where the first digit is A's value, second M, third I, fourth D. Let me check the options again:\n\nOptions:\nA)9 2 0 0 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=0\nB)9 2 0 9 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=9\nC)9 2 0 1 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=1\nD)9 2 0 7 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7\nE)9 2 2 2 \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=2, D=2\n\nHmm, so the first letters in the options are all 9, so A must be 9. That's a key point. So A is 9.\n\nNow, let's proceed. Since E is part of the multiplier BE, and the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD, so E must be 1. Because multiplying by E gives the same number. So E=1.\n\nSo the multiplier is B1. Because the second digit is E, which is 1. So BE is B1.\n\nNow, the second partial product is RAE, which is MAD \u00d7 B (since B is the tens digit, so multiplied by B and shifted left by one). So when we multiply MAD by B, we get RAE. Then when we add MAD (the first partial product) shifted appropriately? Wait, actually, the way multiplication works, the first partial product is E \u00d7 MAD (so units digit), and the second is B \u00d7 MAD shifted left by one (tens digit). So when adding, the total is (B\u00d710 + E) \u00d7 MAD = A M I D.\n\nWait, but the sum of the two partial products (MAD + RAE shifted left by one) must equal AMID. Let me write that numerically.\n\nLet me assign variables:\n\nLet MAD = 100*M + 10*A + D\nBE = 10*B + E\nThe product is (10*B + E)*(100*M + 10*A + D) = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nBut also, the partial products are:\n\nFirst partial product: (E)*(MAD) = MAD \u2192 so E*MAD = MAD \u2192 E must be 1, as before.\n\nSecond partial product: (B)*(MAD) \u00d7 10 \u2192 because shifted left by one (since B is in the tens place). So that's B*MAD*10. \n\nAdding those together: MAD + B*MAD*10 = (1 + 10*B)*MAD = 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nHmm. Let me see:\n\nSo (1 + 10*B)*MAD = AMID (the final product). \n\nBut since the partial products are MAD and RAE (shifted), their sum should be AMID. Let me also note that the second partial product (B*MAD) gives RAE as a three-digit number. So B*MAD must be a three-digit number, RAE. \n\nGiven that A is 9, as per the options, let's plug that in.\n\nSo A = 9.\n\nFirst, since E=1, so the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 1 = MAD. \n\nNow, the second partial product is B*MAD = RAE. Since RAE is a three-digit number, and B is a digit (from 1 to 9, but since BE is a two-digit number, B can't be 0). Let me think of possible values for B.\n\nAlso, the final product is AMID, which is a four-digit number starting with A=9, so AMID is between 9000 and 9999. Since the multiplier is (BE) = B1 (since E is 1), and MAD is a three-digit number. So (B1)*(MAD) = AMID (four-digit). \n\nLet me consider possible values for B. Let's see, since the product is four digits, the multiplier B1 (which is 10B +1) multiplied by MAD (three digits) must give a four-digit number. So (10B +1)*MAD \u2248 1000 to 9999. Let me see possible B values. \n\nThe smallest possible MAD is 100, so (10B+1)*100 \u2265 1000 \u2192 10B+1 \u226510 \u2192 B\u22651 (since B is at least 1). The maximum possible MAD is 999, so (10B+1)*999 \u2264 9999 \u2192 10B+1 \u2264 10 \u2192 10B \u22649 \u2192 B=0, but B can't be 0 because it's the first digit of a two-digit number. Wait, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the upper limit is when B is higher. Wait maybe I miscalculated. Let me think again. Wait, (10B+1)*MAD must be at least 9000 (since AMID starts with 9, so 9000 or higher). Let me see possible B values. Let me think of B as 8 or 9? Let's see:\n\nSuppose B is 9. Then the multiplier is 91. So 91 \u00d7 MAD = AMID (four digits starting with 9). Let's see, 91 \u00d7 MAD must be between 9000 and 9999. Then MAD would be between 9000/91 \u2248 98.9, so 99 up to 9999/91 \u2248 109.8. So MAD would have to be around 100. But the second partial product (B*MAD = 9*MAD) would be 9*MAD. Let's see if that gives a three-digit number. If MAD is 100, then 9\u00d7100=900, which is three digits. So possible. \n\nAlternatively, if B is 8, then 81 \u00d7 MAD must be \u22659000 \u2192 MAD \u2265 9000/81 \u2248 111.1 \u2192 112. So MAD is three digits, so possible. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps B is 9. Let me see if that works.\n\nLet me proceed step by step. Let me note that in the final product AMID, the first digit is A=9, so the product is between 9000 and 9999.\n\nAlso, since the first partial product is MAD \u00d71 = MAD, and the second is B*MAD \u00d710. So adding them gives:\n\nMAD + 10*(B*MAD) = (1 + 10B)*MAD = AMID.\n\nBut AMID is 9000 + 100*M + 10*I + D.\n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the partial products and the sum.\n\nLet me consider the digits in the final product. The first digit is A=9. Let's look at the addition of the two partial products:\n\nThe first partial product (MAD) is a three-digit number. The second partial product (RAE) shifted left by one is a four-digit number (since RAE is three digits, shifted left makes it four digits). Wait no: RAE is three digits, so shifted left becomes a four-digit number. Adding to the first partial product (three digits) gives a four-digit number. \n\nWait, let's write it out:\n\nFirst partial product:      M A D\nSecond partial product:  R A E (shifted left by one \u2192 becomes R A E 0)\nAdding them gives: A M I D\n\nWait, but the sum is AMID. Wait, but the second partial product shifted left would have the last digit in the tens place. Wait, perhaps I should align the numbers properly:\n\nLet me write it vertically:\n\n        M A D\n      x   B E\n      --------\n        M A D   (this is MAD \u00d7 E, which is MAD \u00d71)\n      + R A E   (this is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one digit, so actually R A E 0)\n      --------\n      A M I D\n\nWait, but adding M A D (three digits) and R A E 0 (four digits) must give a four-digit number. So the total sum's thousands digit comes from the carryover or the R A E 0's thousands digit. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second partial product is written as R A E shifted left, so adding:\n\n      M A D\n    + R A E 0\n    ---------\n    A M I D\n\nSo the sum must be a four-digit number. Let me see the addition column by column.\n\nStarting from the rightmost digit (units place):\n\nFirst partial product's units digit: D\nSecond partial product's units digit (since shifted left): 0 (from the E's position being shifted to the tens place)\nSo the units digit of the total is D + 0 = D. But the final product's units digit is D. So that's okay, no problem.\n\nNext, the tens place:\n\nFirst partial product's tens digit: A\nSecond's tens digit: E (since the second partial product's units digit is 0, but the E is now in the tens place after shifting? Wait, let me think again. Wait, the second partial product RAE is written shifted left by one, so the digits are R (hundreds place), A (tens), E (units) before shifting. After shifting left by one, it becomes R (thousands), A (hundreds), E (tens), and 0 (units). Wait no, shifting left one digit multiplies by 10. So RAE as a number is R\u00d7100 + A\u00d710 + E. Shifting left by one digit makes it (RAE)*10 = R\u00d71000 + A\u00d7100 + E\u00d710. So when adding to MAD (which is M\u00d7100 + A\u00d710 + D), the total is:\n\nMAD + (RAE)*10 = (M\u00d7100 + A\u00d710 + D) + (R\u00d71000 + A\u00d7100 + E\u00d710) = R\u00d71000 + (A\u00d7100 + M\u00d7100) + (E\u00d710 + A\u00d710) + D.\n\nWait, but the total is A M I D. Let me see:\n\nLet me write each digit position:\n\nUnits place:\nD (from first partial) + 0 (from second partial) = D. So the units digit matches, so no carryover here.\n\nTens place:\nA (from first) + E (from second's tens place, since RAE shifted is R A E 0, so the E is in the tens place? Wait, the second partial product after shift has its units digit as 0, the tens digit is E, hundreds is A, thousands R. So in the tens place of the sum, it's (A from first partial's tens) + E (from second's shifted tens place). So the total in the tens digit is A + E. But the final product's tens digit is I. So A + E must equal I or I plus 10 if there's a carryover from the units. But units digit didn't have any carryover since D + 0 = D, so no. So A + E = I (mod 10). \n\nHmm, so I = (A + E) mod 10, and possibly a carryover here. Let's note that.\n\nHundreds place: \n\nIn the first partial product, the hundreds digit is M. The second partial product's hundreds digit (from shifted RAE) is A (since shifted RAE has A in the hundreds place). So adding those gives M + A. But also, there could be a carryover from the tens place. Let's say there's a carryover of 'c1' from the tens to hundreds. So the total at hundreds place is (M + A) + c1. The hundreds digit in the final product is M (since AMID has M in the hundreds place). So:\n\n(M + A + c1) mod 10 = M. \n\nSo (A + c1) mod 10 = 0. Which implies that A + c1 must be a multiple of 10. Since A is 9 (from the options), then 9 + c1 \u2261 0 mod10 \u2192 c1 must be 1. Therefore, the carryover from the tens place must be 1, so that 9 + 1 =10 \u2192 mod10 gives 0. \n\nTherefore, the carryover from the tens to hundreds is 1. Which implies that in the tens place, A + E must be at least 10, so that the addition gives a carryover of 1. Since A is 9, then 9 + E must be \u226510 \u2192 E \u22651. But earlier we concluded E=1, which would give 9+1=10, so yes, that works. So I = (9+1) mod10 \u2192 I=0, with a carryover of 1. \n\nSo I must be 0. Looking at the options, the third digit (I) in all options except E is 0. So options A, B, C, D have I as 0. Option E has I=2, so that can be ruled out. So the answer is among A, B, C, D. \n\nSo I=0. \n\nSo now, moving on. Let's check the hundreds place. Since c1 is 1, the sum in hundreds is M + A + 1. The hundreds digit in the final product is M, so (M +9 +1) mod10 = M \u2192 (M +10) mod10 = M \u2192 0 mod10 = M mod10? Wait, (M+10) mod10 = M mod10. So that holds for any M. But also, there might be a carryover here. Let me see: the total sum in the hundreds place is M +9 +1 = M +10. So this would produce a digit of (M+10) mod10 in the hundreds place, which is M mod10, so that matches. However, the carryover from the hundreds to the thousands place would be (M+10)/10, which is floor((M+10)/10). Since M is a digit (0-9), M+10 can be from 10 to 19, so the carryover is 1 or 2? Wait, M is between 0-9. So the maximum is 9 +10 =19 \u2192 carryover of 1 (since 19 divided by 10 is 1.9 \u2192 floor is 1). Wait, 19 gives a carryover of 1 (because 19 mod10 is 9, so 19 = 10*1 +9). So the carryover is 1. \n\nSo the thousands place comes from the thousands digit of the second partial product (R) plus any carryover from the hundreds. \n\nThe thousands place of the total is A (the first digit of AMID is 9). The thousands digit comes from R (from the second partial product's thousands place) plus the carryover from hundreds (which is 1). So R +1 must equal A (which is 9). So R +1 =9 \u2192 R=8. \n\nSo R is 8. \n\nNow, let's recap so far:\n\nE =1 (from first partial product)\n\nA=9 (from options)\n\nI=0 (from tens place analysis)\n\nR=8 (from thousands place)\n\nNow, moving on. \n\nThe second partial product is B*MAD = RAE, which is 8 A E. Since A=9 and E=1, so RAE is 8 9 1. So B*MAD = 891.\n\nWait, so B multiplied by MAD equals 891. \n\nSo B \u00d7 MAD = 891. \n\nWe need to find B and MAD such that this holds, with MAD being a three-digit number (M, A=9, D). Also, since B is a digit (1-9), and the multiplier BE is B1. \n\nSo, let's note that 891 divided by B must be an integer (since MAD is an integer). So B must be a divisor of 891. Let's factor 891 to find possible B values.\n\nFactorizing 891: 891 \u00f7 3 = 297, then 297 \u00f73 =99, \u00f73=33, \u00f73=11. So 891 = 3^4 \u00d7 11. \n\nPossible divisors (since B is a single digit between 1-9):\n\nFactors of 891 that are single-digit: 1, 3, 9, 11 is too big. Wait, 3^4 is 81, but 81 is two digits. So possible B values are 1, 3, 9, 9? Wait 891 \u00f7 9 is 99. Let me see:\n\nPossible B values (divisors of 891):\n\n1: 891 /1=891 \u2192 MAD would be 891, but A is 9, so the second digit is 9, which matches. But then D would be 1. Let's see if that's possible.\n\nWait, but MAD is a three-digit number with A=9, so MAD is M 9 D. So if MAD is 891, then M=8, D=1. Let's see if this works. Let's check if this is a possible solution.\n\nAlternatively B=3: 891 \u00f73 = 297 \u2192 MAD would be 297. Then M is 2, D=7. \n\nB=9: 891 \u00f79=99 \u2192 MAD=99. But that's two digits. So invalid, since MAD must be three digits. \n\nWait, 891 divided by 9 is 99. So that would make MAD=99, which is two digits, so that's not acceptable. So B can't be 9. \n\nB= 11? No, not a digit. \n\nWait, other factors? Let's see 891 \u00f7 11 is 81, but B must be a digit. So possible B is 1, 3, 9, but 9 gives MAD too small. \n\nWait, 891 \u00f7 3 = 297 \u2192 MAD is 297. That works. Let me see.\n\nSo possibilities:\n\nCase 1: B=1 \u2192 MAD=891. Then M is 8, D is 1. Let's see if that works with other constraints.\n\nCase 2: B=3 \u2192 MAD=297 \u2192 M=2, D=7.\n\nLet me check each case.\n\nFirst, Case1: B=1, MAD=891 (so M=8, A=9, D=1). Let's see:\n\nThe final product is AMID. Since A=9, M=8, I=0, D=1 \u2192 AMID should be 9 8 0 1 \u2192 9801.\n\nThe multiplier is BE = B1 \u2192 B=1, so BE is 11. \n\nSo 891 \u00d711 = 9801. Let's compute 891 \u00d711: 891\u00d710=8910 +891 = 9801. That works. \n\nNow check the partial products:\n\nFirst partial: 891 \u00d71 = 891 (matches M A D)\n\nSecond partial: 891 \u00d71 = 891, shifted left \u2192 8910. So written as R A E (the RAE would be 8 9 1 (since R=8, A=9, E=1). So when shifted left, it's 8910. Adding 891 +8910 gives 9801, which is AMID (9801). \n\nSo that works. But looking at the options, the D in this case is 1, so the fourth digit. The options where D is 1 would be option C (9 2 0 1) but here M is 8, which would not be in the options. Wait, the options for M are second digit. Looking back at the options:\n\nThe options are A)9 2 0 0 (A=9, M=2, I=0, D=0) \u2192 no.\n\nWait in this case, M would be 8, so the second digit is 8, but none of the options have M as 8. The options' M is 2 in all except perhaps? Wait all options have M as 2 except none. Wait all options for the second digit (M) are 2. Let me check again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 9 (A) 2 (M) 0 (I) 0 (D)\n\nB)9 2 0 9\n\nC)9 2 0 1\n\nD)9 2 0 7\n\nE)9 2 2 2\n\nAh right, so all options have M=2. So in the case where M is 8, that's not possible. So this case is invalid because the options require M=2. Therefore, this case must be rejected. \n\nSo moving to case2: B=3, MAD=297 \u2192 M=2, A=9, D=7. \n\nSo then, the final product should be AMID \u2192 A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. So AMID is 9207. \n\nThe multiplier BE is B1 \u2192 B=3, so BE is 31. \n\nCalculating 297 \u00d731: \n\n297 \u00d7 30 = 8910; 297 \u00d71 = 297. Total is 8910 +297 = 9207. Which matches AMID (9207). \n\nNow check the partial products:\n\nFirst partial: 297 \u00d71 (E=1) \u2192 297 (MAD \u2192 M=2, A=9, D=7 \u2192 correct).\n\nSecond partial product: 297 \u00d7 B (3) \u2192 297\u00d73 = 891. Which would be RAE. R is 8, A=9, E=1 \u2192 RAE is 891. So that's correct. Then shifted left (\u00d710) gives 8910. Adding 297 +8910 =9207, which matches. \n\nNow, checking the letters:\n\nA=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. Which corresponds to option D: 9 2 0 7. So that's option D. \n\nWait but let's check if other constraints are met. \n\nIn the thousands place: R +1 =9 \u2192 R is 8, which matches (from 891, R is the first digit, 8). \n\nAlso, the value of I is 0, which comes from A + E (9+1=10 \u2192 I is 0 with carryover 1). \n\nSo all the conditions are satisfied here. \n\nNow check the other options. Let's see option D is 9 2 0 7. That would fit this scenario. \n\nWhat about other possibilities? Let's see if B can be another value. \n\nWait, 891 divided by B must be MAD. Are there any other B's?\n\nWait 891 divided by 9 gives 99, which is two digits. So no. \n\nWhat about B= 9? That gives MAD=99, which is two digits, so invalid. \n\nB= 11? Not a digit. \n\nSo the only possible B is 3 and 1. But B=1 gives M=8 which is not in the options. So the only possible solution is B=3, which gives M=2, D=7 \u2192 option D. \n\nWait, but let me check another possible B. Wait, what if B is a different number? For example, maybe B is 7? Let me see. \n\nWait, but 891 divided by 7 is 127.285... which is not an integer. So no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the second partial product must be exactly RAE. Let me think again. \n\nWait, when we compute B \u00d7 MAD, that product must be RAE. So in the case of B=3 and MAD=297, 297 \u00d73 = 891 \u2192 RAE is 891, so R=8, A=9, E=1. Which matches. \n\nAnother check: in the thousands place of the final product, AMID is 9207. So the thousands digit is 9 (A), which comes from R (8) plus carryover 1 (from hundreds place). 8+1=9, so that's correct. \n\nNow, looking at the options, D is 9 2 0 7, so that's correct. \n\nWait but let me check option D's D is 7, which is correct here. \n\nOther options: Option B has D=9. Let me see if that's possible. Suppose D=9. Then in the case where B= something else. But according to our analysis, the only valid scenario is option D. \n\nAlternatively, let me check if there's another possible value for B where M=2. Suppose, for instance, that B= something else. Wait, but B has to be such that B*MAD = RAE, and R is 8. \n\nWait, if B*MAD = 891, and M is 2, then MAD is 2xx (with A=9). So MAD is 29D. \n\nSo 29D \u00d7 B = 891. \n\nWait, but in the case where B=3, 297 \u00d73=891. \n\nAlternatively, if B= something else? Let me see: \n\nSuppose B= 3 is the only possible. \n\nSo yes, that's the only way. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be D) 9 2 0 7. \n\nBut let me check the other options to make sure. \n\nOption C is 9 2 0 1 (D=1). That would mean in our case, D=1, but in that case, the final product would have D=1. But in that case, the MAD would be 291 (since M=2, A=9, D=1). Then B*MAD must be RAE = 891. So 291 \u00d7 B = 891 \u2192 B= 891/291 \u22483.06, which is not an integer. So that's not possible. \n\nOption B is D=9. Let's see: D=9 would mean MAD ends with 9. So MAD is 299. Then B*299=891 \u2192 B= 891/299 \u22483. So 299 \u00d73=897. Not 891. So no. \n\nOption A is D=0. So MAD is 290. B\u00d7290 = 891 \u2192 891/290\u22483.07. Not integer. \n\nThus, only option D works. \n\nSo the answer is D.\n\n\nThe problem involves a multiplication of a three-digit number (MAD) by a two-digit number (BE) resulting in a four-digit number (AMID). The partial products are MAD (from multiplying by E) and RAE shifted left (from multiplying by B). \n\n1. **Determine E**: The first partial product (MAD \u00d7 E) equals MAD, so E must be 1.\n2. **Identify A**: All options start with A=9, so A=9.\n3. **Analyze Tens Place**: The tens digit of the sum (I) comes from A + E (9 + 1 = 10), so I=0 with a carryover of 1.\n4. **Thousands Place**: The thousands digit (A=9) requires R + 1 = 9, so R=8.\n5. **Solve for B and MAD**: The second partial product (B \u00d7 MAD = RAE = 891). Testing divisors of 891:\n   - B=3 gives MAD=297 (since 297\u00d73=891), which fits the digits M=2, D=7, and satisfies all constraints.\n   - Other values for B either fail digit constraints or do not align with the options.\n\nThe valid solution corresponds to option D (A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7).\n\nAnswer: D",
