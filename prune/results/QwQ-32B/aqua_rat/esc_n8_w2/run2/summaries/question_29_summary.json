      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem about the jeep's journey. Hmm, the question says that the jeep takes 6 hours going somewhere and then comes back in 4 hours by increasing its speed by 12 km/h. I have to find the distance traveled. Wait, the distance should be the same both ways, right? So the forward and return journeys cover the same distance but with different speeds and times.\n\nLet me think. Let me denote the original speed as 'v' km/h. Then, the distance for the forward journey would be speed multiplied by time, so that's v * 6. \n\nOn the return trip, the speed is increased by 12 km/h, so the return speed is (v + 12) km/h. The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours, so the distance there would be (v +12) *4. \n\nSince both distances are the same (it's the same journey there and back), I can set them equal:\n\n6v = 4(v + 12)\n\nNow I can solve for v. Let's expand the right side: 4v + 48. \n\nSo the equation becomes 6v = 4v +48. Subtract 4v from both sides: 2v =48. Then v = 24 km/h. \n\nWait, so the original speed was 24 km/h. Then the distance for the forward journey is 24 *6 = 144 km. Since the return trip is the same distance, the total distance would be double that? Wait, no, the question says \"What is the distance travelled by the jeep?\" probably meaning the one way distance? Or the total? Let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"What is the distance travelled by the jeep?\" Hmm, sometimes in such problems, the total distance (there and back) is asked, but here the options include 144, which would be one way. Let me check the options again. The options are A)126, B)144, C)127, D)228, E)128. \n\nHmm, so if the one-way distance is 144, then the answer would be B. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me verify. \n\nWait, let's check the return trip. The return speed is 24 +12=36 km/h. 36 *4= 144. Yes, same distance. So the one-way distance is 144, so the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me make sure the question isn't asking for the total round trip. The wording says \"distance travelled\" during the entire journey? The question says \"the distance travelled by the jeep\" \u2014 the forward journey took 6 hours, return took 4. So total distance would be 144 *2 =288, but that's not among the options. So the question must be asking for one way. \n\nLooking at the options again, 144 is option B. So I think that's the answer. Let me check my equations again. \n\nOriginal equation: 6v =4(v+12). Solving gives v=24, so 6*24=144. Correct. So the answer should be B.\n",
