      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out when the two cars will meet. Let me see. The highway is 50 miles long, right? And they start from opposite ends at the same time. One is going 12 mph, the other 13 mph. Hmm, I remember that when two objects are moving towards each other, their speeds add up. So maybe I can use that to find the time it takes for them to meet.\n\nLet me think. The total distance between them is 50 miles. Their combined speed is 12 + 13, which is 25 mph. Oh right, because they're moving towards each other, so the speed adds. Then time equals distance divided by speed. So time would be 50 divided by 25. That would be 2 hours? Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 2. But wait, maybe I did that wrong. Let me check again.\n\nWait, no. Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go through it step by step. The two cars are starting from opposite ends of a 50-mile highway. So the distance between them is 50 miles. The first car's speed is 12 mph, the second's is 13 mph. Since they're moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. So 12 +13 is indeed 25 mph. So the time until they meet is total distance divided by relative speed. 50 divided by 25 is exactly 2 hours. So that would be answer E?\n\nBut wait the options include 2 as E. Hmm, but I feel like maybe I'm missing something here. Let me see. Wait, maybe the question is a trick question. Like maybe the highway's length isn't the distance between the two cars? Wait no, the highway is 50 miles long, so they start at opposite ends, so the distance between them is exactly 50 miles. So the calculation should be correct. Then why is the option E 2, which would be the answer. But let me check the options again. The options are A)1, B)1.25, C)1.5, D)1.75, E)2. So 2 is an option. So that's the answer?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in adding the speeds. Let me think again. Suppose car A is going east at 12 mph and car B is going west at 13 mph. The distance between them decreases by (12+13) miles every hour. So yes, the combined speed is correct. So in t hours, the distance covered by both would be 12t +13t =25t. When that equals 50 miles, they meet. So 25t =50 \u2192 t=2. So the answer should be E) 2. But wait, the options include that. Hmm, but I thought maybe the answer was 1.5? Did I miscalculate?\n\nWait, maybe I added wrong. 12+13 is 25? Yes. 12 plus 13 is 25. 50 divided by 25 is 2. So that's correct. So why do I feel uncertain? Maybe the question is trying to trick me into thinking about something else. Like maybe the highway's length isn't the distance between them? Wait, the highway is 50 miles long. So starting from opposite ends, the distance between them is exactly the length of the highway, so 50 miles. So I think that's right. So the answer must be E) 2. Hmm. Let me see the options again. The options are given as A to E, with E being 2. So I think that's correct.\n",
