      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is about finding the probability that a randomly chosen number from 1 to 1000 is relatively prime to 1000. Hmm, right. Relatively prime means their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. So I need to figure out how many numbers between 1 and 1000 don't share any common factors with 1000 except 1. \n\nFirst, I should factorize 1000 to find its prime factors. Let's see, 1000 is 10 cubed, so that's 2^3 * 5^3. So the prime factors are 2 and 5. Therefore, any number that isn't divisible by 2 or 5 will be relatively prime to 1000. Wait, actually, numbers not divisible by 2 or 5, or not divisible by either? Because if a number is divisible by 2 or 5, then it shares a common factor with 1000, so we want numbers not divisible by either. \n\nSo the problem reduces to counting how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are not divisible by 2 or 5, then divide that by 1000 to get the probability. \n\nThis sounds like inclusion-exclusion principle. Let me recall the formula. The number of numbers not divisible by 2 or 5 is equal to total numbers minus those divisible by 2 or 5. \n\nAlternatively, using inclusion-exclusion for the count of numbers divisible by 2 or 5: \n\nNumber divisible by 2: floor(1000/2) = 500\nNumber divisible by 5: floor(1000/5) = 200\nBut then numbers divisible by both 2 and 5 (i.e., divisible by LCM(2,5)=10) are counted twice, so subtract those. Number divisible by 10: floor(1000/10) = 100.\n\nSo total numbers divisible by 2 or 5: 500 + 200 - 100 = 600. \n\nTherefore numbers not divisible by 2 or 5 are 1000 - 600 = 400. \n\nSo the probability would be 400/1000, which simplifies to 2/5. Wait, but hold on, that would be 400 divided by 1000, which reduces to 2/5. But let me check the options again. Option D is 2/5. Hmm, but I think I might be missing something here. Wait, wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in inclusion-exclusion?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate:\n\nDivisible by 2: 1000 divided by 2 is exactly 500, so yes. Divisible by 5: 1000/5 is 200. Divisible by both (10) is 100. So 500+200-100 =600. So total numbers not divisible by either would be 1000-600=400. So 400/1000 = 0.4 which is 2/5. So that would be D. \n\nBut wait, I recall that Euler's totient function \u03c6(n) gives the number of integers up to n that are coprime to n. Maybe I should use that approach to cross-verify. \n\nEuler's totient function \u03c6(1000). Since 1000 factors into 2^3 * 5^3, the formula is \u03c6(n) = n * product (1 - 1/p) for each prime p dividing n. \n\nSo \u03c6(1000) = 1000 * (1 - 1/2) * (1 - 1/5) = 1000 * (1/2) * (4/5) \n\nCalculating that: 1000 * 0.5 = 500; 500 * 0.8 = 400. So \u03c6(1000) is indeed 400. Therefore, the probability is 400/1000 = 2/5, which is option D. \n\nHmm, so why is there an option C (4/7) or others? Did I do something wrong here? Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the question says \"from 1 to 1000 inclusive\" so that's exactly 1000 numbers. So the calculation seems right. So the answer should be D. \n\nBut wait, let me think once more. Let me try with a smaller number to see if my approach is correct. Let's say n = 10. Then numbers from 1-10. Numbers coprime to 10 are 1,3,7,9. That's 4 numbers. So \u03c6(10)=4. Which is 10*(1-1/2)*(1-1/5)= 10*(1/2)*(4/5) = 4, correct. The probability would be 4/10 = 2/5. So same ratio. So that's correct. \n\nAnother example, n=2. Numbers coprime to 2: 1, so 1/2, which is 2/5? Wait no, 1/2 is 0.5, which is 1/2. Wait, but 2's factors are 2, so the totient is 1. So 1/2. Which would be same as (1-1/2) = 1/2. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so in the case of 10, the probability is 4/10 = 2/5, which matches. So the approach is correct. So the answer is D, 2/5. \n\nSo looking at the options, D is 2/5, so that must be correct. Therefore, I think the answer is D.\n",
