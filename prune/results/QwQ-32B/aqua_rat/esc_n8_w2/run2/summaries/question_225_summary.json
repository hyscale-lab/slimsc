      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, a rectangular parking space with three sides painted. The unpainted side is one of the sides, right? Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. The question says the unpainted side is 9 feet. So, I need to figure out which sides are painted and which isn't. \n\nWait, the problem mentions three sides are painted. Since a rectangle has four sides, one side isn't painted. The unpainted side is given as 9 feet. Let me think. Let's assume that the parking space has a length and a width. Let me denote the sides. Let's say the rectangle has length L and width W. The sides would be two lengths and two widths. \n\nThe unpainted side could be either a length or a width. The problem states that the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet. Hmm, so depending on which side is unpainted, the painted sides would add up to different totals. \n\nLet me consider possibilities. Let's suppose the unpainted side is one of the lengths. So, the painted sides would be the other length and the two widths. Wait, but if the unpainted is a length, then the painted sides would be the other length (so that's one side) and the two widths. So total painted sides would be L + 2W. \n\nAlternatively, if the unpainted side is a width, then the painted sides would be the two lengths and one width. So that would be 2L + W. \n\nThe problem says the unpainted side is 9 feet. So if the unpainted is a length, then L is 9. Then the painted sides would be L (the other length, which is also 9) plus 2W. Wait, no, that would be 9 + 2W. Wait, but the sum of the painted sides is 37. \n\nAlternatively, if the unpainted is a width (so W is 9), then the painted sides are 2L + W (since one width is painted, the other is not). Wait, no, the two lengths and one width would be painted. So 2L + W = 37. \n\nHmm, so I need to figure out which scenario is correct. Let me try both possibilities. \n\nFirst case: unpainted is length (so L=9). Then the painted sides sum to L + 2W = 9 + 2W = 37. Then 2W = 28 \u2192 W=14. Then the area would be L*W = 9*14 = 126. That's option C. \n\nSecond case: unpainted is width (so W=9). Then the painted sides are 2L + W = 2L +9 =37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Then area is 14*9=126 again. Wait, same area? Oh, because in either case, the product is 14 times 9, which is the same as 9 times14. So regardless of whether the unpainted side is length or width, the area would be 126. So the answer must be C)126. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem again. The unpainted side is the length, or maybe they specified which side is unpainted? Wait the question says \"the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet\". Oh! Wait, the unpainted side is a length? Because they refer to its length as 9. So the unpainted side's length is 9. Wait, but in a rectangle, all sides are either length or width. So if the unpainted side is, say, a length, then the length is 9. But then the other length is also 9. So in that case, the painted sides would be the other length (9) and the two widths. \n\nAlternatively, if the unpainted side is a width, then that width is 9, and the other width is 9. Then the painted sides are the two lengths and one width (the other width is unpainted). \n\nEither way, the calculations lead to the area being 126, which is option C. \n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify whether the unpainted side is a length or a width, but the problem says \"the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet\". So the term \"length\" here is just the measurement, not the side's name. Because in a rectangle, the sides can be length or width. So the unpainted side could be either a length or a width. But regardless, in both scenarios, the area comes out the same. So either way, the answer is 126. So option C is correct. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through again. \n\nSuppose unpainted side is a length (so L=9). Then painted sides: the other length (9) and two widths (W each). Sum of painted sides: 9 + 2W =37 \u2192 2W=28 \u2192 W=14. Area is 9\u00d714=126. \n\nIf unpainted side is a width (so W=9), then painted sides are two lengths (each L) and one width (the other width is unpainted). Wait, no, if the unpainted is a width, then there are two widths. The unpainted is one of them, so the other width is painted. Wait, no, the three painted sides would be the two lengths and one of the widths. Because the other width is unpainted. So the painted sides: 2L + W (since the unpainted is the other W). So W here is 9. So 2L +9 =37 \u2192 2L=28 \u2192 L=14. Then area is L\u00d7W=14\u00d79=126 again. \n\nSo either way, the area is the same. So the answer is C. \n\nLooking at the options, C is 126. So the answer must be C. \n\nWait, but let me check if there's any other possible way. Like, maybe the three sides painted are all three sides except one corner? Wait, no. A rectangle has four sides. Three sides painted. So it's three consecutive sides? Or any three? But regardless, in a rectangle, the three sides would have to include two of one dimension and one of another. \n\nWait, for example, imagine the parking space is painted on three sides. Suppose it's like the front and two sides. So maybe the front is the unpainted side. But that would mean the front is length, and the two sides (widths) plus the back (length) are painted. So that would be two lengths and one width. Wait, that would be similar to the case where the unpainted side is the front (a length). \n\nAlternatively, maybe the three sides painted are two widths and one length. Like, if the unpainted is a width. \n\nIn any case, the math works out the same. So the area is 126. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n",
