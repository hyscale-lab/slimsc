      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is asking if 120 is reduced to 96, what's the reduction percentage. Hmm, I need to figure out the percentage decrease here. Let me think about how percentage decrease works.\n\nFirst, the formula for percentage decrease is [(Original - New)/Original] * 100, right? So the original number is 120, and the new number after reduction is 96. So subtract 96 from 120 to get the amount of decrease. Let me calculate that: 120 minus 96 equals 24. So the decrease is 24.\n\nNow, I have to divide that decrease by the original amount. So 24 divided by 120. Let me do that division. 24 \u00f7 120... Hmm, maybe I can simplify the fraction first. Both numbers are divisible by 24? Let's see: 24 divided by 24 is 1, and 120 divided by 24 is 5. So that simplifies to 1/5. \n\nWait, 1 divided by 5 is 0.2. To get the percentage, I multiply by 100, so 0.2 times 100 is 20%. So that would be 20% decrease. Let me check the options. Option C is 20%, so that should be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. The formula is (Original - New)/Original. Yeah, because if the new is less than original, the difference is the amount reduced. So yeah, 24 over 120 gives the proportion of the decrease. So yes, 20% makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think the other way? Like (New - Original)/Original, but that would be negative. But percentage decrease is the absolute value, so that's not the case. \n\nAnother way to check: 20% of 120 is 24. So subtracting that gives 96, which matches. So that's correct. So the answer must be C.\n",

Percentage reduction... right, the formula for percentage decrease is the amount of decrease divided by the original amount, then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how much the number was reduced by. The original number is 120, and it's reduced to 96. So the decrease is 120 minus 96. Let me calculate that. 120 minus 96 equals... 24. Oh right, because 96 plus 24 is 120. So the amount reduced is 24.\n\nNow, applying the formula: (decrease/original) * 100. Plugging in the numbers, that's (24/120) * 100. Let me compute that. 24 divided by 120. Hmm, maybe simplify the fraction first. 24 over 120, both divisible by 24? Wait, 24 divided by 24 is 1, and 120 divided by 24 is 5. So that's 1/5. Oh, right, 1/5 as a decimal is 0.2. Multiply that by 100 gives 20%. Wait, but hold on, the options include 20% as option C. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes people get confused between percentage decrease and increase.\n\nWait, the question says \"reduction percent\", which should be the percentage decrease. So yes, the calculation is correct. The decrease is 24 from 120. 24 divided by 120 is indeed 0.2, so 20%. So the answer should be C?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. The formula is (original - new)/original *100. So yes, exactly. So (120-96)/120 *100 =24/120*100 =20%. So that's correct.

Hmm, 120 divided by 24 is 5, so 24/120 is 1/5. 1 divided by 5 is 0.2. 0.2 times 100 is 20. So yes, 20%. So C is correct. Then why is there an option B as 40%? Maybe a common mistake is to do 24 divided by 96 instead? Let me check that. 24 divided by 96 is 0.25, which would be 25%, but that's not an option here. Alternatively, maybe someone might subtract 96 from 120 wrong? Like 120-96 is 24, which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says if 120 is reduced to 96, what is the reduction percent? So yes, that's a 20% reduction. So the correct answer is C. The options given are A)30%, B)40%, C)20%, D)10%, E)5%.
