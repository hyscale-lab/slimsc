      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the cover price per issue of the magazine. The subscription is for 15 issues costing $42, and that's a 25% saving compared to the cover prices. Hmm, so the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price for all 15 issues. \n\nWait, the saving is 25% of the cover prices. So first, I should find out what the total cover price would be without the subscription. Let me think. If the subscription gives a 25% saving, that means the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price. Because 100% minus 25% saving equals 75% of the original price. \n\nSo, let me set variables. Let me call the total cover price for 15 issues as T. The subscription price is $42, which is 75% of T. So, 0.75*T = 42. To find T, I can divide 42 by 0.75. \n\nCalculating that: 42 divided by 0.75. Let's see, 42 divided by 0.75 is the same as 42 multiplied by 4/3, right? Because 1 divided by 0.75 is 4/3. So 42 * 4 is 168, divided by 3 gives 56. So the total cover price for 15 issues is $56. \n\nThen, the cover price per issue would be 56 divided by 15. Let me calculate that. 15 times 3 is 45, so 56 minus 45 is 11. So 3.733... approximately. Wait, 15 times 3.73 would be? Let me do the division properly. 56 divided by 15. \n\nHmm, 15 \u00d7 3.73 is 15 \u00d73 =45, 15\u00d70.73 is 10.95, so total 55.95, which is close to 56. But maybe I should do exact division. \n\nAlternatively, 56 divided by 15: 15 \u00d7 3 =45, subtract that from 56 leaves 11. Bring down a zero: 110 divided by 15 is 7 (since 15\u00d77=105), remainder 5. Then another zero: 50 divided by 15 is 3 (15\u00d73=45), remainder 5 again. So it's 3.7333... So approximately $3.73 recurring. \n\nLooking at the options, option E is $3.73, but wait, the options are A)$7.73, B)$6.73, C)$5.73, D)$4.73, E)$3.73. Wait, but 3.73 is option E, but let me check again because maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait a second, maybe I messed up the saving part. Let me go back. The saving is 25% of the cover prices. So the total cover price for 15 issues is T. The subscription price is T minus 25% of T, which is 75% of T. So yes, that part is correct. So 0.75*T = 42, so T is 56. Then per issue is 56/15 \u2248 3.7333, so that would round to $3.73, which is E. \n\nWait, but the options include E as 3.73. But let me think again. The question says the subscription represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. So the total saving is 25% of the total cover price. So the subscription price is total cover price minus 25% of that, so yes, 75% of T. So that part's correct. \n\nHmm. So the calculation leads to E. But wait, maybe the question is asking for the cover price per issue, so perhaps I did it right. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me read again: \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". Wait, the wording here is important. The saving is 25% of the cover prices. So total saving is 25% of the total cover price. Therefore, the subscription price is (Total cover price) - (25% of total cover price) = 75% of total cover price. \n\nSo 0.75*T = 42 \u2192 T = 56. So per issue cover price is 56/15 \u22483.7333. So the closest is E, $3.73. \n\nBut let me check if any of the options are close. Wait, the options given are A to E. So E is the fifth option. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is saying that each issue's subscription price is 25% off the cover price. Then, the subscription price per issue would be 75% of the cover price. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is ambiguous. Let me parse it again. The question says \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". So the total saving is 25% of the total cover price. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the saving per issue is 25%, so the subscription price per issue is 75% of the cover price. Let me see both interpretations. \n\nFirst interpretation: total saving is 25% of total cover price. So total cost is 75% of total cover price. So that's how I did it. \n\nSecond interpretation: the subscription price per issue is 75% of the cover price per issue. Then total subscription cost would be 15 * (0.75 * cover price per issue) = 42. Then, solving for cover price per issue would be 42/(15*0.75) = 42/(11.25) = 3.733..., which is the same result. Wait, so either way, the answer comes to the same. \n\nHmm, so in that case, yes, the answer is E. \n\nBut looking at the options, E is $3.73, which is what I calculated. But I thought maybe I made a mistake because sometimes these questions can be tricky. Let me check the arithmetic again. \n\nTotal cover price T = 42 / 0.75 = 56. 56 divided by 15 is indeed 3.7333... So $3.73 when rounded to the nearest cent. Since 0.733 is 73.333... cents, so it's $3.73. So the correct answer should be E. \n\nWait, but the options given include E as 3.73. Then that's the answer. Hmm, but I thought maybe I missed something. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)7.73\n\nB)6.73\n\nC)5.73\n\nD)4.73\n\nE)3.73\n\nYes, so E is there. So the answer must be E. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the saving calculation. Let me think again. If the saving is 25% of the cover price, then the total amount saved is 25% of T. So the subscription price is T - 0.25T = 0.75 T = 42. So T is 56. So yes. \n\nTherefore, the cover price per issue is 56/15 \u22483.7333. So E is correct. \n\nHmm. I think that's right. So the answer is E.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The problem says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42 and that this is a 25% saving off the cover prices. I need to find the cover price per issue. Hmm, so the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price. \n\nWait, right. So the saving is 25% of the total cover price, and the subscription price is the total cover price minus that 25%. Let me think. Let me denote the cover price per issue as, say, x. Then the total cover price for 15 issues would be 15x. \n\nThe saving is 25% of that total cover price. So the saving amount is 0.25 * 15x. Therefore, the subscription price is the total cover price minus the saving. So:\n\nSubscription price = Total cover price - saving\nWhich is 15x - (0.25 * 15x) = 42.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think of the subscription being 75% of the total cover price since it's a 25% saving. Because if you save 25%, you're paying 75% of the original price. Oh right, that might be a better way to approach it.\n\nSo 75% of 15x equals 42. So 0.75*(15x) = 42.\n\nLet me write that equation again: 0.75*(15x) = 42.\n\nSo solving for x, first multiply 15 and 0.75? Wait, no, first let's compute 15x multiplied by 0.75 equals 42.\n\nSo 15x * 0.75 =42. Then, to find x, divide both sides by (15*0.75). Let me compute 15 *0.75 first. 15 times 0.75 is 11.25? Wait, 15 *0.75 is the same as 15*(3/4) which is 11.25. So 11.25x =42? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the total cover price is 15x. The subscription price is 75% of that. So the subscription price is 0.75*(15x) =42. So the equation is correct. \n\nSo 0.75 multiplied by 15x equals 42. Let me compute 0.75 *15 first. 0.75 times 15: 15*0.75 is 11.25. So 11.25x =42. Wait, no. Wait, that would be if 15x was multiplied by 0.75. Wait, actually, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.75*(15x) = (0.75*15)*x. So yes, 11.25x =42. Wait, but that would mean x = 42 / 11.25. Let me calculate that. \n\n42 divided by 11.25. Hmm, 11.25 times 3 is 33.75. 42 minus 33.75 is 8.25. So 3.733... So approximately 3.733... Wait, but that can't be right because the options are all higher. Wait, maybe I messed up the equation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the cover price per issue is x. So total cover price for 15 is 15x. The subscription price is 42, which is 25% less than the total cover price. So 42 = 15x - 0.25*(15x) \u2192 which is 15x*(1 -0.25) = 42 \u2192 15x *0.75 =42. So that's correct. So solving for x: x = 42/(15 *0.75). \n\nCalculating denominator first: 15 *0.75 = 11.25. So x =42 / 11.25. Let me compute this division. 42 divided by 11.25. Let me think of this as 42 \u00f7 11.25. \n\nAlternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 4200 / 1125. Let's see. Simplify the fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 75? 4200 \u00f775 is 56, and 1125 \u00f775 is 15. So 56/15. Hmm, 56 divided by 15 is 3.7333... So approximately $3.73? But that's option E, but that seems too low. Wait, but the options are A through E, with E being 3.73. But the question asks for the cover price per issue. If the subscription is cheaper, then the cover price should be higher than the subscription's per-issue cost. \n\nWait, let's see. The subscription is $42 for 15 issues. So the per-issue subscription price is 42/15. Let me calculate that: 42 divided by 15 is 2.8. So $2.8 per issue via subscription. But the cover price is higher. The saving is 25% off the cover price. So the subscription price per issue is 75% of the cover price. So if the subscription per issue is $2.8, then the cover price per issue would be 2.8 /0.75. \n\nAh! Maybe I approached it wrong. Wait, perhaps I need to think per issue. Let me try that approach again. \n\nAlternative approach: Let me consider that each issue's cover price is x. The subscription price per issue is (42/15). The saving per issue is 25% of x. So the subscription price per issue is x minus 25% of x, which is 0.75x. \n\nSo (42/15) = 0.75x. \n\nThen solving for x: x = (42/15)/0.75. \n\nCalculating numerator first: 42 divided by 15 is 2.8. Then 2.8 divided by 0.75. Let me compute that: 2.8 /0.75. \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 100 to get 280 /75. 75 \u00d73 is 225, subtract that from 280 gives 55. 55/75 is 0.733..., so total is 3.733... So $3.73, which is option E. Wait but the options given include E as 3.73. But that seems conflicting with my first approach, but actually both approaches give the same result. Wait, so why did I think that was conflicting? \n\nWait, because I thought the answer might be higher. But according to the calculations, it's 3.73. But let me check again. \n\nWait, the problem says the subscription represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me read again. \n\nThe question says: \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Is the total subscription price $42.00, and that amount is the result of saving 25% off the total cover price? So the total cover price is (15x), and the subscription is 15x minus 25% of 15x, so 75% of 15x is 42. Then 0.75*(15x)=42 \u2192 same as before. So x =42/(15\u00d70.75) = 3.733..., which is $3.73, so option E. \n\nBut wait, the options given are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. So E would be the answer. But why does the initial thought that the subscription per issue is $2.80 and the cover price is higher? 3.73 is indeed higher than 2.80, so that's okay. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be E. But wait, let me check once more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted as the saving per issue is 25% of the cover price. Let me see. \n\nSuppose the cover price per issue is x. Then the subscription price per issue is x - 0.25x = 0.75x. The total subscription price is 15 *0.75x = 10.5x. The total is $42, so 10.5x =42 \u2192 x =42 /10.5= 4. So that would be $4. But that's not an option. Wait, but 42 divided by 10.5 is indeed 4. Hmm, but that would be $4, but option D is $4.73. So that approach gives a different answer. Wait, so which interpretation is correct?\n\nThe problem says the subscription \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". \n\nHmm, maybe \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\" refers to the total saving being 25% of the total cover price. \n\nThe first approach was correct. Let me parse the sentence again. \n\nThe total subscription cost is $42, which is the amount after saving 25% of the total cover prices. \n\nSo the saving is 25% of the total cover price (i.e., total cover price is 15x, saving is 0.25*15x, so the subscription price is 15x -0.25*15x =0.75*15x =42. \n\nSo solving for x gives 3.73. \n\nAlternatively, if the saving per issue is 25% of the cover price per issue, then per issue you save 0.25x, so the subscription price per issue is 0.75x, and total subscription is 15*0.75x =10.5x =42 \u2192 x=4. But 4 is not one of the options except D is 4.73. Wait, so that's conflicting. \n\nWait, but the problem states \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". The wording is ambiguous. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\" could mean that the total saving is 25% of the sum of all the cover prices. So the total you pay is (Total cover price) minus 25% of (Total cover price) = 75% of total. So that's the first approach. \n\nAlternatively, if the saving is 25% per issue, then each issue's subscription price is 75% of the cover price, so total is 15*(0.75x) =10.5x. \n\nSo which is it? \n\nThe wording says: \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". \n\nHmm. The phrase \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\" probably refers to the total saving. Because \"saving\" is a total amount. \n\nFor example, if the total cover price is $X, then the saving is 0.25X, so the subscription price is X -0.25X =0.75X =42. \n\nTherefore, X =42 /0.75=56. So total cover price is $56. Therefore, per issue cover price is 56 /15. \n\nWait, that's another way to compute. Let me do that. \n\nTotal cover price for 15 issues is 15x. The saving is 25% of that total, so 0.25*15x. The subscription price is total minus saving: 15x -0.25*15x =11.25x. Wait, no, that's 15x*(1-0.25) =11.25x? Wait, no. 15x*(0.75) =11.25x? Wait 15 times 0.75 is 11.25. So 15x *0.75 is 11.25x? Wait, no, 15 multiplied by 0.75 is 11.25, so 15x multiplied by 0.75 is (15 *0.75)x =11.25x. \n\nWait, but the subscription price is 11.25x equals 42? So x =42 /11.25 =3.733..., so same as before. So the cover price per issue is $3.73, which is E. \n\nBut then why does the second approach (saving per issue) give a different answer? Because that approach assumes the saving per issue is 25% of the cover price per issue. The question's wording might be interpreted either way. \n\nBut the way it's phrased: \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". The \"cover prices\" plural probably refers to the total of all the cover prices. So the total saving is 25% of the total cover prices. \n\nTherefore, the first calculation is correct, and the answer is E) $3.73. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate 42 divided by (15 *0.75). \n\n15 *0.75 =11.25. 42 divided by 11.25. Let me compute this as fractions. \n\n42 divided by 11.25. Let's write 11.25 as 45/4 (since 11.25 *4 =45). So 42 divided by (45/4) is 42 * (4/45) = (42*4)/45 =168/45. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3: 56/15. 56 divided by 15 is 3.733..., so yes. So $3.73, which is option E. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be E. \n\nWait, but I'm confused because if the cover price is $3.73, then the subscription price per issue is 42/15 = $2.80. The saving per issue would be 3.73 -2.80 =0.93. 0.93 is 25% of 3.73? Let's see: 25% of 3.73 is 0.9325, which is approximately 0.93. So that checks out. So the total saving is 15 *0.93 =13.95, and the total cover price is 15*3.73=55.95. 25% of 55.95 is 13.9875, which is approximately the saving. So that works. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The problem says that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42 and that this is a 25% saving off the cover prices. I need to find the cover price per issue. Hmm, so the subscription price is 25% less than the total cover price. \n\nWait, right. So the saving is 25% of the total cover price, and the subscription price is the total cover price minus that 25%. Let me think. Let me denote the cover price per issue as, say, x. Then the total cover price for 15 issues would be 15x. \n\nThe saving is 25% of that total cover price. So the saving amount is 0.25 * 15x. Therefore, the subscription price is the total cover price minus the saving. So:\n\nSubscription price = Total cover price - saving\nWhich is 15x - (0.25 * 15x) = 42.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think of the subscription being 75% of the total cover price since it's a 25% saving. Because if you save 25%, you're paying 75% of the original price. Oh right, that might be a better way to approach it.\n\nSo 75% of 15x equals 42. So 0.75*(15x) = 42.\n\nLet me write that equation again: 0.75*(15x) = 42.\n\nSo solving for x, first multiply 15 and 0.75? Wait, no, first let's compute 15x multiplied by 0.75 equals 42.\n\nSo 15x * 0.75 =42. Then, to find x, divide both sides by (15*0.75). Let me compute 15 *0.75 first. 15 times 0.75 is 11.25? Wait, 15 *0.75 is the same as 15*(3/4) which is 11.25. So 11.25x =42? Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the total cover price is 15x. The subscription price is 75% of that. So the subscription price is 0.75*(15x) =42. So the equation is correct. \n\nSo 0.75 multiplied by 15x equals 42. Let me compute 0.75 *15 first. 0.75 times 15: 15*0.75 is 11.25. So 11.25x =42. Wait, no. Wait, that would be if 15x was multiplied by 0.75. Wait, actually, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.75*(15x) = (0.75*15)*x. So yes, 11.25x =42. Wait, but that would mean x = 42 / 11.25. Let me calculate that. \n\n42 divided by 11.25. Hmm, 11.25 times 3 is 33.75. 42 minus 33.75 is 8.25. So 3.733... So approximately 3.733... Wait, but that can't be right because the options are all higher. Wait, maybe I messed up the equation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the cover price per issue is x. So total cover price for 15 is 15x. The subscription price is 42, which is 25% less than the total cover price. So 42 = 15x - 0.25*(15x) \u2192 which is 15x*(1 -0.25) = 42 \u2192 15x *0.75 =42. So that's correct. So solving for x: x = 42/(15 *0.75). \n\nCalculating denominator first: 15 *0.75 = 11.25. So x =42 / 11.25. Let me compute this division. 42 divided by 11.25. Let me think of this as 42 \u00f7 11.25. \n\nAlternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 4200 / 1125. Let's see. Simplify the fraction. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 75? 4200 \u00f775 is 56, and 1125 \u00f775 is 15. So 56/15. Hmm, 56 divided by 15 is 3.7333... So approximately $3.73? But that's option E, but that seems too low. Wait, but the options are A through E, with E being 3.73. But the question asks for the cover price per issue. If the subscription is cheaper, then the cover price should be higher than the subscription's per-issue cost. \n\nWait, let's see. The subscription is $42 for 15 issues. So the per-issue subscription price is 42/15. Let me calculate that: 42 divided by 15 is 2.8. So $2.8 per issue via subscription. But the cover price is higher. The saving is 25% off the cover price. So the subscription price per issue is 75% of the cover price. So if the subscription per issue is $2.8, then the cover price per issue would be 2.8 /0.75. \n\nAh! Maybe I approached it wrong. Wait, perhaps I need to think per issue. Let me try that approach again. \n\nAlternative approach: Let me consider that each issue's cover price is x. The subscription price per issue is (42/15). The saving per issue is 25% of x. So the subscription price per issue is x minus 25% of x, which is 0.75x. \n\nSo (42/15) = 0.75x. \n\nThen solving for x: x = (42/15)/0.75. \n\nCalculating numerator first: 42 divided by 15 is 2.8. Then 2.8 divided by 0.75. Let me compute that: 2.8 /0.75. \n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 100 to get 280 /75. 75 \u00d73 is 225, subtract that from 280 gives 55. 55/75 is 0.733..., so total is 3.733... So $3.73, which is option E. Wait but the options given include E as 3.73. But that seems conflicting with my first approach, but actually both approaches give the same result. Wait, so why did I think that was conflicting? \n\nWait, because I thought the answer might be higher. But according to the calculations, it's 3.73. But let me check again. \n\nWait, the problem says the subscription represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices. Hmm, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Let me read again. \n\nThe question says: \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Is the total subscription price $42.00, and that amount is the result of saving 25% off the total cover price? So the total cover price is (15x), and the subscription is 15x minus 25% of 15x, so 75% of 15x is 42. Then 0.75*(15x)=42 \u2192 same as before. So x =42/(15\u00d70.75) = 3.733..., which is $3.73, so option E. \n\nBut wait, the options given are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. So E would be the answer. But why does the initial thought that the subscription per issue is $2.80 and the cover price is higher? 3.73 is indeed higher than 2.80, so that's okay. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be E. But wait, let me check once more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is interpreted as the saving per issue is 25% of the cover price. Let me see. \n\nSuppose the cover price per issue is x. Then the subscription price per issue is x - 0.25x = 0.75x. The total subscription price is 15 *0.75x = 10.5x. The total is $42, so 10.5x =42 \u2192 x =42 /10.5= 4. So that would be $4. But that's not an option. Wait, but 42 divided by 10.5 is indeed 4. Hmm, but that would be $4, but option D is $4.73. So that approach gives a different answer. Wait, so which interpretation is correct?\n\nThe problem says the subscription \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". \n\nHmm, maybe \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\" refers to the total saving being 25% of the total cover price. \n\nThe first approach was correct. Let me parse the sentence again. \n\nThe total subscription cost is $42, which is the amount after saving 25% of the total cover prices. \n\nSo the saving is 25% of the total cover price (i.e., total cover price is 15x, saving is 0.25*15x, so the subscription price is 15x -0.25*15x =0.75*15x =42. \n\nSo solving for x gives 3.73. \n\nAlternatively, if the saving per issue is 25% of the cover price per issue, then per issue you save 0.25x, so the subscription price per issue is 0.75x, and total subscription is 15*0.75x =10.5x =42 \u2192 x=4. But 4 is not one of the options except D is 4.73. Wait, so that's conflicting. \n\nWait, but the problem states \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". The wording is ambiguous. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\" could mean that the total saving is 25% of the sum of all the cover prices. So the total you pay is (Total cover price) minus 25% of (Total cover price) = 75% of total. So that's the first approach. \n\nAlternatively, if the saving is 25% per issue, then each issue's subscription price is 75% of the cover price, so total is 15*(0.75x) =10.5x. \n\nSo which is it? \n\nThe wording says: \"represents a saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". \n\nHmm. The phrase \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\" probably refers to the total saving. Because \"saving\" is a total amount. \n\nFor example, if the total cover price is $X, then the saving is 0.25X, so the subscription price is X -0.25X =0.75X =42. \n\nTherefore, X =42 /0.75=56. So total cover price is $56. Therefore, per issue cover price is 56 /15. \n\nWait, that's another way to compute. Let me do that. \n\nTotal cover price for 15 issues is 15x. The saving is 25% of that total, so 0.25*15x. The subscription price is total minus saving: 15x -0.25*15x =11.25x. Wait, no, that's 15x*(1-0.25) =11.25x? Wait, no. 15x*(0.75) =11.25x? Wait 15 times 0.75 is 11.25. So 15x *0.75 is 11.25x? Wait, no, 15 multiplied by 0.75 is 11.25, so 15x multiplied by 0.75 is (15 *0.75)x =11.25x. \n\nWait, but the subscription price is 11.25x equals 42? So x =42 /11.25 =3.733..., so same as before. So the cover price per issue is $3.73, which is E. \n\nBut then why does the second approach (saving per issue) give a different answer? Because that approach assumes the saving per issue is 25% of the cover price per issue. The question's wording might be interpreted either way. \n\nBut the way it's phrased: \"saving of 25 percent of the cover prices\". The \"cover prices\" plural probably refers to the total of all the cover prices. So the total saving is 25% of the total cover prices. \n\nTherefore, the first calculation is correct, and the answer is E) $3.73. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are A)7.73, B)6.73, C)5.73, D)4.73, E)3.73. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me re-calculate 42 divided by (15 *0.75). \n\n15 *0.75 =11.25. 42 divided by 11.25. Let me compute this as fractions. \n\n42 divided by 11.25. Let's write 11.25 as 45/4 (since 11.25 *4 =45). So 42 divided by (45/4) is 42 * (4/45) = (42*4)/45 =168/45. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 3: 56/15. 56 divided by 15 is 3.733..., so yes. So $3.73, which is option E. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be E. \n\nWait, but I'm confused because if the cover price is $3.73, then the subscription price per issue is 42/15 = $2.80. The saving per issue would be 3.73 -2.80 =0.93. 0.93 is 25% of 3.73? Let's see: 25% of 3.73 is 0.9325, which is approximately 0.93. So that checks out. So the total saving is 15 *0.93 =13.95, and the total cover price is 15*3.73=55.95. 25% of 55.95 is 13.9875, which is approximately the saving. So that works. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.\n\n\nTo determine the cover price per issue, we start by noting that the subscription price of $42.00 represents a 25% saving off the total cover price for 15 issues.
