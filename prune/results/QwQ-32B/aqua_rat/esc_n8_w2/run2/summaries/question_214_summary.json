      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem is about a boy trying to climb a staircase with 10 steps. He can take either one or two steps at a time, and we need to find out how many different ways he can reach the top. Hmm, right. I remember this is a classic dynamic programming problem. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should start by considering smaller numbers of steps and see if I can find a pattern. Like, if there was just 1 step, obviously there's only 1 way: take one step. If there are two steps, he can either take two single steps or one double step, so that's 2 ways. For three steps, let's see: the first move could be a single step, leaving two steps remaining (which we know has 2 ways), or the first move is a double step, leaving one step (which has 1 way). So total for three steps would be 2 + 1 = 3.\n\nWait a second, this looks like the Fibonacci sequence. Because each time, the number of ways for n steps is the sum of the ways for (n-1) and (n-2). Because if he takes a single step first, the remaining is n-1 steps, and if he takes a double step, the remaining is n-2 steps. So the total ways for n steps are the sum of the two previous numbers.\n\nLet me verify with a few more examples. For four steps: the first step could be 1, then 3 steps (which has 3 ways), or 2 steps first, then 2 steps (which has 2 ways). So 3 + 2 =5. That fits with Fibonacci (since 1,2,3,5... yeah). \n\nSo the pattern is indeed the Fibonacci numbers. The nth term here would be Fib(n+1), maybe? Let's check:\n\nNumber of steps: n | Ways:\n1 \u21921 (Fib(2) is 1)\n2 \u21922 (Fib(3) is 2)\n3 \u21923 (Fib(4) is 3)\n4 \u21925 (Fib(5)=5)\n5 \u21928 (Fib(6)=8)\nSo yeah, it's the (n+1)th Fibonacci number. Because for n steps, the answer is Fib(n+1). \n\nWait, let me confirm with n=1: Fib(2)=1, which matches. So for n=10 steps, the number of ways should be Fib(11). Let me compute the Fibonacci numbers up to the 11th term.\n\nStarting with Fib(1)=1, Fib(2)=1, Fib(3)=2, Fib(4)=3, Fib(5)=5, Fib(6)=8, Fib(7)=13, Fib(8)=21, Fib(9)=34, Fib(10)=55, Fib(11)=89. Oh! So Fib(11) is 89. That would mean the answer is 89, which is option B.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't shift the indices wrong. Let me reindex again. Let's think of the problem as:\n\nLet f(n) be the number of ways to reach step n. Then f(0) = 1 (there's one way to be at the ground level, doing nothing). f(1)=1, f(2)=f(1)+f(0)=2, f(3)=f(2)+f(1)=3, f(4)=5, etc. So f(n) = Fib(n+1). So for n=10, f(10)= Fib(11)=89. So yes, the answer is B)89.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think of the Fibonacci sequence starting with 1,1,2,3,5... so the 10th term would be 55, but the 11th is 89. So yeah, 10 steps would give 89 ways, so option B.\n",

We need to find out how many different ways he can do this. Hmm, I remember this might be a classic dynamic programming problem. Let me think.\n\nLet's see, maybe it's similar to the Fibonacci sequence? Because for each step, the number of ways to get there depends on the previous steps. Like, if he's on step n, he could have gotten there by taking a 1-step from n-1 or a 2-step from n-2. So the total ways to reach step n is the sum of the ways to reach n-1 and n-2. \n\nLet me test this idea with smaller numbers. Suppose there's 1 step. Then there's only 1 way: take a single step. For 2 steps, he can take two 1-steps or one 2-step, so that's 2 ways. For 3 steps, it should be the sum of the ways for 2 and 1, so 2 + 1 = 3. Let me check: the possibilities are 1+1+1, 1+2, or 2+1. Yep, that's 3. \n\nContinuing this pattern, the number of ways for step n is the (n)th Fibonacci number, but shifted. Wait, because for step 1 it's 1, step 2 is 2, step 3 is 3, step 4 would be 5 (since 3+2), right? So the pattern follows the Fibonacci sequence starting from 1, 2, 3, 5... So the nth step's ways are the (n+1)th Fibonacci number? Let me see. Let's list them out:\n\nStep 0: Well, if there's 0 steps, there's 1 way (do nothing). But maybe that's part of the base case here. Let me think again. The problem is for 10 steps, so maybe the formula is the (n+1)th Fibonacci number. Let's see:\n\nLet me write down the Fibonacci numbers starting from index 1:\n\nF(1) = 1\n\nF(2) = 1\n\nF(3) = 2\n\nF(4) = 3\n\nF(5) = 5\n\nWait, that's the standard sequence. But in our problem:\n\nNumber of ways for step 1 is 1 (F(2)=1?), step 2 is 2 (F(3)=2), step 3 is 3 (F(4)=3), step4 would be 5 (F(5)=5). So yes, the number of ways for n steps is F(n+1), where F(1)=1, F(2)=1, etc. \n\nSo for 10 steps, the number of ways would be F(11). Let me compute that:\n\nLet me list the Fibonacci numbers up to F(11):\n\nF(1)=1\n\nF(2)=1\n\nF(3)=2\n\nF(4)=3\n\nF(5)=5\n\nF(6)=8\n\nF(7)=13\n\nF(8)=21\n\nF(9)=34\n\nF(10)=55\n\nF(11)=89\n\nAh, so F(11) is 89. Therefore the answer should be B)89. Let me double-check with another approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can model it as a recursive function. Let's define f(n) as the number of ways to reach step n. Then f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2). The base cases are f(0) = 1 (there's one way to stand at the base), f(1)=1. So f(2) = f(1)+f(0)=2, which matches. Then f(3)=f(2)+f(1)=2+1=3. So yeah, the recursive formula is correct, and the base cases here are f(0)=1 and f(1)=1. \n\nSo for n=10, the value is f(10) = f(9)+f(8). Let's compute that step by step:\n\nf(0) = 1\n\nf(1)=1\n\nf(2)=2\n\nf(3)=3\n\nf(4)=5\n\nf(5)=8\n\nf(6)=13\n\nf(7)=21\n\nf(8)=34\n\nf(9)=55\n\nf(10)=89\n\nYes, exactly. So the answer must be B)89. The options given include B as 89, so that's the one.\n",
