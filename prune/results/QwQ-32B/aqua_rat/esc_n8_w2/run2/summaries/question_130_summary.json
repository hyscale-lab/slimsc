      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the question is about finding out what percentage of the astronaut's Earth weight their Venus weight is. Let me see. The astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth and 182 on Venus. Hmm, percentage calculation, right?\n\nWait, the formula for percentage is (part / whole) * 100. Here, the part would be the Venus weight, and the whole is the Earth weight. So I need to divide 182 by 211 and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nLet me do the division first. 182 divided by 211. Let's see, 211 times 0.8 is 168.8. Because 211*0.8 = 168.8. But 182 is higher than that. Maybe 0.86? Let me check 211 multiplied by 0.86. \n\nBreaking it down: 200*0.86 is 172, and 11*0.86 is about 9.46. So total would be 172 + 9.46 = 181.46. Oh, that's really close to 182. So 0.86 times 211 gives approximately 181.46, which is almost 182. So the percentage is around 86%. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 86%, so that's probably the answer. Let me just confirm the calculation again. 182 divided by 211 equals... Let me do this division more accurately. \n\n182 \u00f7 211. Let me set it up as a division problem. Since 211 goes into 182 zero times, add a decimal. 211 into 1820. How many times? Let's see, 211*8 is 1688, subtract that from 1820: 1820-1688=132. Bring down a zero, making it 1320. 211*6 is 1266. Subtract to get 54. Bring down another zero, making 540. 211*2 is 422, so 2 more. 540-422 is 118. Bring down a zero, making 1180. 211*5 is 1055. Subtract to get 125. Hmm, this is getting tedious. So far, the division gives 0.862... approximately 0.862, so 86.2%. Which rounds to 86%, so D is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says \"approximately\" so the closest option is D. The options are 50,60,70,86,90. So 86 is the closest. Yep, that's right.\n",
