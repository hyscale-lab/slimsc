      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the company makes 420 units each month, right? And each unit costs them $110 to produce. They want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400. So I need to find the minimum selling price per component that meets this profit target. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of units produced in a year. Since it's 420 per month, over 12 months that's 420 multiplied by 12. Let me calculate that: 420 * 12. Well, 400*12 is 4800, and 20*12 is 240, so total is 5040 units a year. \n\nNext, the total production cost for the year would be the number of units times the cost per unit. So 5040 * $110. Let me compute that. 5000*110 is 550,000, and 40*110 is 4,400. Adding those together gives 554,400. So total production cost per year is $554,400. \n\nThe profit is revenue minus costs. They want the profit to be at least $626,400. So, the revenue needs to be profit plus costs. Let me write that down: Revenue \u2265 626,400 + 554,400. Adding those numbers: 626,400 + 554,400 equals 1,180,800. So the revenue must be at least $1,180,800 per year.\n\nNow, revenue is the selling price per component multiplied by the number of units sold. Since they sell all 5040 units each year, the revenue equation is: Selling price (let's call it S) times 5040 \u2265 1,180,800. \n\nSo, to find the minimum S, we can rearrange that inequality: S \u2265 1,180,800 / 5040. Let me calculate that division. \n\nHmm, 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me see if I can simplify this. Maybe divide numerator and denominator by 10 first to get 118,080 / 504. Let me try dividing both by 12. 504 divided by 12 is 42. 118,080 divided by 12 is 9,840. So now it's 9,840 /42. Let's see, 42 times 234 is 9828. Wait, 42*200 is 8400, 42*230 is 9660. 9,840 minus 9,660 is 180. 180 divided by 42 is 4.285... Hmm, maybe I did that wrong. Wait, perhaps another way.\n\nAlternatively, 5040 times 234: Let's see, 5040*200=1,008,000. 5040*34 = 5040*(30 +4) = 151,200 + 20,160 = 171,360. So total would be 1,008,000 + 171,360 = 1,179,360. That's still less than 1,180,800. The difference is 1,180,800 - 1,179,360 = 1,440. So 1,440 divided by 5040 per dollar? Wait, maybe I need to find the exact value.\n\nAlternatively, let's do the division step by step. 1,180,800 \u00f7 5040. Let's see, 5040 x 200 = 1,008,000. Subtract that from 1,180,800: 1,180,800 - 1,008,000 = 172,800. Now, 5040 x 34 is 5040*30=151,200 plus 5040*4=20,160 \u2192 171,360. Hmm, 172,800 -171,360 =1,440. So 200 +34=234, and then 1,440 left. 1,440 divided by 5040 is 0.2857... So the total is 234.2857... So approximately $234.29 per unit. \n\nBut since the question asks for the minimum selling price that will guarantee the profit is at least $626,400, we need to round up to the nearest cent, but since the options are whole numbers, perhaps the answer must be the next whole dollar. Because if the price is $234.29, then 234.29 *5040 would give exactly the required revenue. But since the options are integers, the minimum integer price would be 235? Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are 226,230,240,260,280. Wait, 234.2857 is approximately 234.29. The options given don't have 234 or 235. The closest higher option is 230 (option B) but that's lower than 234.28. Wait, that can't be right. Did I miscalculate?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made an error in the total production cost or revenue required.\n\nWait the problem says the profit must be at least 626,400. Profit is revenue minus production cost. So Revenue = Profit + Cost. The total cost is 420 units/month * 12 months * $110/unit. Let's recalculate that. 420 *12 is indeed 5040 units. 5040 *110: 5000*110 is 550,000 and 40*110 is 4,400. 550k +4,400 = 554,400. So that's correct. \n\nSo the required revenue is 626,400 + 554,400 = 1,180,800. Correct. Then, 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let me do that division again. Let me see, perhaps I should do it as fractions. Let me see, 1,180,800 divided by 5040. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 10: 118,080 / 504. Then divide numerator and denominator by 24: 118080 /24 is 4920, 504/24 is 21. So 4920 divided by 21. Let's compute that. 21 * 234 = 21*(200+34) = 4200 + 714 = 4914. So 21*234=4914. So 4920-4914=6. So 6/21= 2/7. So total is 234 and 2/7, which is approximately 234.2857. \n\nSo the minimum price per unit must be at least $234.2857. Since the options are whole numbers, and the question asks for the minimum price that will guarantee the profit, we need to round up to the next whole dollar. Because if you charge exactly 234, that's below the required amount, so the profit would be less. So the minimum price has to be 235. But none of the options is 235. Wait the options are A)226, B)230, C)240, D)260, E)280. Hmm, so 234.2857 is between B (230) and C (240). Since 234.28 is more than 230, so 230 would not be enough. The next option is 240, which would give a higher revenue. So the minimum price from the options given that meets the requirement is 240? Let me check that.\n\nWait, let me see: if the selling price is $240, then the revenue is 5040 *240. Let me calculate that: 5000*240=1,200,000 and 40*240=9,600. Total revenue would be 1,209,600. Then subtract the production cost of 554,400, so profit is 1,209,600 -554,400 = 655,200. Which is more than the required 626,400. So 240 is sufficient. \n\nWhat about 230? Let's check. 230*5040. 5000*230=1,150,000, 40*230=9,200. Total revenue: 1,159,200. Profit would be 1,159,200 -554,400 = 604,800. Which is less than 626,400. So that's not enough. \n\nSo the minimum price from the options must be 240. So the correct answer is C)240. \n\nWait, but the options didn't have 234 or 235. So the next possible option is C. Therefore, the answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the company makes 420 units each month, right? And each costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The question is asking for the minimum selling price per component so that their yearly profit is at least $626,400. \n\nFirst, I need to remember that profit is revenue minus costs. Since they want the yearly profit, I have to calculate the total revenue for the year, subtract the total production costs for the year, and set that equal to or greater than $626,400. Then solve for the selling price.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the selling price per component as 'p'. \n\nThe monthly production is 420 units. Over a year, that's 12 months, so total units produced and sold in a year would be 420 * 12. Let me calculate that. 420 times 12... 400*12 is 4800, plus 20*12 which is 240, so total is 5040 units per year. \n\nThe total revenue would then be the selling price per unit times the number of units sold annually. So that's 5040 * p. \n\nThe total production cost for the year is the cost per unit times the number of units. The cost per unit is $110, so total cost is 5040 * 110. \n\nProfit is revenue minus cost, so:\n\nProfit = (5040 * p) - (5040 * 110) \u2265 626,400.\n\nWe need to find the minimum p that satisfies this inequality.\n\nLet me rearrange the inequality. Let's factor out the 5040:\n\n5040*(p - 110) \u2265 626,400.\n\nThen divide both sides by 5040 to solve for (p - 110). Let me compute 626400 divided by 5040. Hmm, maybe simplify the numbers first. \n\nAlternatively, I can compute 5040 \u00d7 100 = 504,000. 626,400 - 504,000 is 122,400. So 5040 \u00d7 122,400? Wait, maybe I should do division properly.\n\nLet me see: 5040 \u00d7 123 = 5040*120 + 5040*3 = 604,800 + 15,120 = 620,  (Wait 604,800 +15,120 is 620, 920? Wait 604,800 plus 15,120 is 619,920? Hmm, maybe this approach is getting confusing. Let me do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 626,400 \u00f7 5040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 62,640 \u00f7 504.\n\nHmm, 504 \u00d7 124 is 504*(120 +4) = 60,480 + 2,016 = 62,496. That's close to 62,640. The difference between 62,640 and 62,496 is 144. 504 \u00d7 0.2857 (since 504*(144/504) = 144/504 = 0.2857). So 124 + 0.2857 \u2248 124.2857. So approximately 124.2857. \n\nWait, but let me see if there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me see: 626,400 divided by 5040. Let's see if both can be divided by 10: 62640 / 504. Then divide numerator and denominator by 12? 504 \u00f712 is 42. 62640 \u00f712 is 5,220. So now 5,220 /42. Let me compute that. 42 \u00d7 124 is 5208 (42*120=5040, 42*4=168, so total 5040+168=5208). 5220 - 5208 =12. So 124 + 12/42 = 124 + 2/7 \u2248124.2857. \n\nSo the division gives 124.2857. \n\nSo, p - 110 \u2265 124.2857. Therefore, p \u2265 110 + 124.2857 = 234.2857. \n\nHmm, so the minimum selling price needs to be at least approximately $234.29. \n\nLooking at the options, the possible choices are 226,230,240,260,280. \n\nThe minimum price must be at least 234.29, so the smallest option that's higher than that is 240. Option C. \n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure. Because maybe I made an error in the division.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute 5040*(p -110) = 626,400. \n\nSo solving for p:\n\np = (626400 /5040) + 110. \n\nLet me compute 626400 divided by 5040. \n\nAlternatively, 5040 is 7*720, but maybe better to think of 5040 divided by 60 is 84. 626400 divided by 60 is 10440. So 10440 divided by 84. Let's see:\n\n84 \u00d7 124 = 10,416 (since 84*120=10,080, plus 84*4=336 \u2192 total 10,080+336=10,416). \n\n10,440 -10,416 =24. So 24/84 = 2/7. So total is 124 + 2/7 \u2248124.2857. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. So 124.2857 +110 is 234.2857. So the minimum price is approximately 234.29. \n\nLooking at the options, the next possible value above this is 240 (C). \n\nWait but wait, maybe I miscalculated the total units. Let me confirm that. The company produces 420 units each month, so over 12 months, 420*12. Let me compute that again. 420*12: 400*12 is 4800, plus 20*12=240 \u2192 total 5040. That's correct. \n\nSo the calculation seems right. Therefore, the minimum price must be at least ~234.29, so the options given have 230 (B) and 240 (C). 230 is below that, so 240 is the minimum required. So the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the company makes 420 units each month, right? And each costs them $110 to produce. They sell all of them by the end of each month. The question is asking for the minimum selling price per component so that their yearly profit is at least $626,400. \n\nFirst, I need to remember that profit is revenue minus costs. Since they want the yearly profit, I have to calculate the total revenue for the year, subtract the total production costs for the year, and set that equal to or greater than $626,400. Then solve for the selling price.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the selling price per component as 'p'. \n\nThe monthly production is 420 units. Over a year, that's 12 months, so total units produced and sold in a year would be 420 * 12. Let me calculate that. 420 times 12... 400*12 is 4800, plus 20*12 which is 240, so total is 5040 units per year. \n\nThe total revenue would then be the selling price per unit times the number of units sold annually. So that's 5040 * p. \n\nThe total production cost for the year is the cost per unit times the number of units. The cost per unit is $110, so total cost is 5040 * 110. \n\nProfit is revenue minus cost, so:\n\nProfit = (5040 * p) - (5040 * 110) \u2265 626,400.\n\nWe need to find the minimum p that satisfies this inequality.\n\nLet me rearrange the inequality. Let's factor out the 5040:\n\n5040*(p - 110) \u2265 626,400.\n\nThen divide both sides by 5040 to solve for (p - 110). Let me compute 626400 divided by 5040. Hmm, maybe simplify the numbers first. \n\nAlternatively, I can compute 5040 \u00d7 100 = 504,000. 626,400 - 504,000 is 122,400. So 5040 \u00d7 122,400? Wait, maybe I should do division properly.\n\nLet me see: 5040 \u00d7 123 = 5040*120 + 5040*3 = 604,800 + 15,120 = 620,  (Wait 604,800 +15,120 is 620, 920? Wait 604,800 plus 15,120 is 619,920? Hmm, maybe this approach is getting confusing. Let me do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, let's compute 626,400 \u00f7 5040.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: 62,640 \u00f7 504.\n\nHmm, 504 \u00d7 124 is 504*(120 +4) = 60,480 + 2,016 = 62,496. That's close to 62,640. The difference between 62,640 and 62,496 is 144. 504 \u00d7 0.2857 (since 504*(144/504) = 144/504 = 0.2857). So 124 + 0.2857 \u2248 124.2857. So approximately 124.2857. \n\nWait, but let me see if there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps factor numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me see: 626,400 divided by 5040. Let's see if both can be divided by 10: 62640 / 504. Then divide numerator and denominator by 12? 504 \u00f712 is 42. 62640 \u00f712 is 5,220. So now 5,220 /42. Let me compute that. 42 \u00d7 124 is 5208 (42*120=5040, 42*4=168, so total 5040+168=5208). 5220 - 5208 =12. So 124 + 12/42 = 124 + 2/7 \u2248124.2857. \n\nSo the division gives 124.2857. \n\nSo, p - 110 \u2265 124.2857. Therefore, p \u2265 110 + 124.2857 = 234.2857. \n\nHmm, so the minimum selling price needs to be at least approximately $234.29. \n\nLooking at the options, the possible choices are 226,230,240,260,280. \n\nThe minimum price must be at least 234.29, so the smallest option that's higher than that is 240. Option C. \n\nWait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure.

So 10440 divided by 84. Let's see:\n\n84 \u00d7 124 = 10,416 (since 84*120=10,080, plus 84*4=336 \u2192 total 10,080+336=10,416). \n\n10,440 -10,416 =24. So 24/84 = 2/7. So total is 124 + 2/7 \u2248124.2857. \n\nSo yes, that's correct. So 124.2857 +110 is 234.2857.
