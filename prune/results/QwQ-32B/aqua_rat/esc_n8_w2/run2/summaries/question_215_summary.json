      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about mixing orange juice in a soft drink to change the percentage. Hmm. The original drink is 1 gallon, right? And it's 40% orange juice and 60% water. So, the question is asking how much more orange juice we need to add to make the orange juice 60% of the new mixture.\n\nAlright, let me think step by step. Let me start by figuring out how much orange juice and water are in the original gallon. Since it's 40% OJ, that's 0.4 gallons of OJ, and 0.6 gallons of water. The water stays the same because we're only adding OJ, right?\n\nSo, let's say we add x gallons of orange juice. The total volume of the new mixture will be 1 + x gallons. The amount of OJ in the new mixture will be 0.4 + x gallons. We want OJ to be 60%, so the equation would be:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6*(1 + x)\n\nHmm, solving for x here. Let's do that. Multiply out the right side: 0.6 + 0.6x. So the equation becomes:\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nSubtract 0.6x from both sides: 0.4 + 0.4x = 0.6\n\nThen subtract 0.4 from both sides: 0.4x = 0.2\n\nDivide both sides by 0.4: x = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5. Wait, that would give x as 0.5? But looking at the options, 0.5 is option A. But wait, that seems too low. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me go through the steps again. Let me write the equation again. The desired concentration is 60% OJ. So the new OJ amount is original OJ (0.4) plus added (x), divided by total new volume (1 + x) equals 0.6. So:\n\n(0.4 + x)/(1 + x) = 0.6\n\nMultiply both sides by (1 + x):\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)\n\nExpanding the right side: 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nSo, 0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nSubtract 0.6x and 0.4 from both sides:\n\nx - 0.6x = 0.6 - 0.4\n\n0.4x = 0.2\n\nx = 0.2 / 0.4 = 0.5. So the answer would be 0.5, which is option A. But wait, intuitively, adding 0.5 to the original 0.4 gives 0.9 OJ in a total of 1.5 gallons. 0.9 / 1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. So that works. But why do I feel like the answer might be different?\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again. It says \"how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?\" So the original is 1 gallon. Adding x gallons of OJ gives total volume 1 +x, and OJ becomes 60% of that. So the calculation is correct. Then the answer is 0.5? But option A is 0.5. Hmm.\n\nWait, but sometimes these problems can be tricky. Let me think of another way. Suppose we have 1 gallon. The water is 0.6 gallons. Since water doesn't change, maybe we can look at the percentage of water in the final mixture. If OJ is 60%, then water is 40%. The 0.6 gallons of water is 40% of the total. So total volume would be 0.6 / 0.4 = 1.5 gallons. Since original is 1 gallon, need to add 0.5 gallons. Oh, that's another way to get the same answer. So that confirms it. The answer is 0.5, option A. Wait, but I thought maybe the answer was higher. Maybe I was overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check with the first approach again. Suppose I add 0.5 gallons of OJ. Then total OJ is 0.4 +0.5 =0.9. Total drink is 1.5. 0.9 /1.5 is indeed 0.6. So yes. So the correct answer is A)0.5? But the options given include A as 0.5. Hmm, but I recall sometimes similar problems where the answer is different. Wait, maybe I need to check again.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for additional gallons, but the initial OJ is 0.4. If you need to have 60% in total, maybe I need to think in terms of the ratio. Let me see another approach. Let me denote x as the amount of OJ to add. The final mixture has (0.4 + x) OJ and (0.6) water. The total is (1 +x). The OJ is 60%, so:\n\n(0.4 + x)/(1 +x) = 0.6 \u2192 same equation. So solving again gives x=0.5. So the answer should be A. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A, but why is the option C 1.25 there? Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased as \"additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink\". Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the original 1 gallon, and when adding OJ, the total becomes more. Let me try again:\n\nLet me think in terms of the concentration. Original: 40% OJ. Need to get to 60% OJ. Let me use the method of alligation or something.\n\nAlternatively, think of the amount of OJ and water. The water remains constant at 0.6 gallons. Since in the final mixture, water is 40% (because OJ is 60%), so 0.6 gallons is 40%, so total is 1.5 gallons. So the total needs to be 1.5, so you need to add 0.5 gallons. So yes, that's the same answer. So A is correct. Maybe I was overcomplicating earlier. Hmm, maybe the answer is A. But I thought maybe I was missing something. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)0.5, B)1, C)1.25, D)1.5, E)2. So according to my calculations, A is correct. But maybe I made a mistake in assuming that adding x gallons gives total 1+x. Let me confirm.\n\nSuppose I have 1 gallon of the drink. Adding x gallons of OJ. Since OJ is 100% OJ, then yes, the total volume is 1 + x. The OJ comes from original 0.4 plus x. So that's correct. So yes, the answer must be A. But why is this an option? Because sometimes people might think of the ratio differently, but in this case, the math checks out. So I think the correct answer is A)0.5.\n",

Now, we need to add some amount of orange juice, let's call it x, so that the new mixture has 60% orange juice. \n\nThe total volume after adding x gallons of OJ would be 1 + x gallons. The amount of OJ in that would be the original 0.4 plus the x we added. So the equation would be:\n\n(0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6\n\nI need to solve for x. Let's do the algebra step by step.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive? Because if I add 0.5 gallons to the original 1, making it 1.5 total. Then OJ would be 0.4 +0.5=0.9. 0.9/1.5 is 0.6, which is 60%. Oh, that actually works.

Let me try that approach. Because when you add OJ, the amount of water stays the same, right?\n\nOriginal mixture: 0.6 gallons water. After adding x gallons of OJ, the total volume is 1 +x, and the water is still 0.6. Since we want OJ to be 60%, the water would then be 40% of the total. So 0.6 = 0.4*(1 +x). Let's see that.\n\nYes, that's another way. Let me do that.\n\nSince water is 60% of original, which is 0.6 gallons. In the new mixture, water should be 40% (since OJ is 60%). So 0.6 = 0.4*(Total Volume). So Total Volume = 0.6 /0.4 = 1.5 gallons. The original was 1 gallon, so we need to add 0.5 gallons. So same answer. So that confirms it. So the answer should be A)0.5. \n\nWait but why is the option C)1.25 there? Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says \"how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?\" \n\nYes, that's exactly what I did. The original is 1 gallon. Adding 0.5 gives total of 1.5, and OJ is 0.9 which is 60%. So that works. So the correct answer is A. But why do I recall sometimes these problems have a different approach? Wait maybe I should check again.\n\nWait, maybe the question is in terms of ratio? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not starting with 1 gallon, but the original is an unspecified amount. Wait, the question says \"one gallon of soft drink\" is made of 40% OJ. So the initial is 1 gallon. So yeah, that approach is correct.\n\nHmm. So the answer is A)0.5. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you change concentrations, the answer isn't as straightforward, but in this case, both methods give me 0.5. So maybe the answer is A. But let me see the options again. The options are A to E, with A being 0.5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the amount in additional gallons beyond the original OJ? Wait no, the question says \"additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in\", so the answer should be 0.5. So the correct answer is A. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose someone thought in terms of the concentration difference. Like, maybe using some formula. Let me see. Suppose the initial volume is 1 gallon. Let x be the amount added. The equation is (0.4 + x) / (1 +x) = 0.6. Solving:\n\nMultiply both sides by (1+x):\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nThen x - 0.6x = 0.6 -0.4 \u2192 0.4x =0.2 \u2192 x=0.5.

Let's see that.\n\nYes, that's another way. Let me do that.\n\nSince water is 60% of original, which is 0.6 gallons. In the new mixture, water should be 40% (since OJ is 60%). So 0.6 = 0.4*(Total Volume). So Total Volume = 0.6 /0.4 = 1.5 gallons. The original was 1 gallon, so we need to add 0.5 gallons. So same answer. So that confirms it. So the answer should be A)0.5. \n\nWait but why is the option C)1.25 there? Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says \"how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink?\" \n\nYes, that's exactly what I did. The original is 1 gallon. Adding 0.5 gives total of 1.5, and OJ is 0.9 which is 60%. So that works. So the correct answer is A. But why do I recall sometimes these problems have a different approach? Wait maybe I should check again.\n\nWait, maybe the question is in terms of ratio? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not starting with 1 gallon, but the original is an unspecified amount. Wait, the question says \"one gallon of soft drink\" is made of 40% OJ. So the initial is 1 gallon. So yeah, that approach is correct.\n\nHmm. So the answer is A)0.5. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes when you change concentrations, the answer isn't as straightforward, but in this case, both methods give me 0.5. So maybe the answer is A. But let me see the options again. The options are A to E, with A being 0.5. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the amount in additional gallons beyond the original OJ? Wait no, the question says \"additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in\", so the answer should be 0.5. So the correct answer is A. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose someone thought in terms of the concentration difference. Like, maybe using some formula. Let me see. Suppose the initial volume is 1 gallon. Let x be the amount added. The equation is (0.4 + x) / (1 +x) = 0.6. Solving:\n\nMultiply both sides by (1+x):\n\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\nThen x - 0.6x = 0.6 -0.4 \u2192 0.4x =0.2 \u2192 x=0.5. So yeah, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is A. Maybe I was overcomplicating. So the answer must be A)0.5.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with 1 gallon of soft drink that is 40% orange juice (OJ) and 60% water. This means there is 0.4 gallons of OJ and 0.6 gallons of water. Let \\( x \\) be the additional gallons of OJ added. The new total volume becomes \\( 1 + x \\) gallons, and the new amount of OJ is \\( 0.4 + x \\). We need the OJ to be 60% of the new mixture:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{0.4 + x}{1 + x} = 0.6\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( 1 + x \\):\n\n\\[\n0.4 + x = 0.6(1 + x)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side:\n\n\\[\n0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\( 0.6x \\) and 0.4 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n0.4x = 0.2\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{0.2}{0.4} = 0.5\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that adding 0.5 gallons of OJ achieves the desired 60% concentration. Verifying, the new total volume is 1.5 gallons, with 0.9 gallons of OJ (0.4 + 0.5), which is indeed 60%.\n\n**Answer: A**",
