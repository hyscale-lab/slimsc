      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a shopkeeper selling a watch with discounts. Let me see if I can figure this out. The question is asking for the marked price of the watch. The options are given, so maybe I can set up an equation and solve it step by step.\n\nAlright, the problem states that when the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he makes a certain profit. But if he gives a 7% discount instead, his profit is Rs. 15 less. The key here is to relate the difference in discounts to the change in profit. Since the cost price probably remains the same in both scenarios, the difference in selling price (due to the discount) would directly translate to the difference in profit.\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the marked price as MP. \n\nWhen the discount is 5%, the selling price (SP1) would be MP minus 5% of MP. So SP1 = MP * (1 - 0.05) = 0.95 * MP.\n\nIf the discount is 7%, then the selling price (SP2) would be MP * (1 - 0.07) = 0.93 * MP.\n\nThe profit in each case would be SP minus the cost price (CP). Let's call the cost price CP. \n\nSo Profit1 = SP1 - CP = 0.95MP - CP.\n\nProfit2 = SP2 - CP = 0.93MP - CP.\n\nThe problem says that when the discount increases by 2% (from 5% to 7%), the profit decreases by Rs.15. So the difference between Profit1 and Profit2 is 15 rupees. \n\nSo Profit1 - Profit2 = 15.\n\nSubstituting the equations:\n\n(0.95MP - CP) - (0.93MP - CP) = 15.\n\nSimplify that. The CP terms cancel out because -CP + CP is zero. So:\n\n0.95MP - 0.93MP = 15.\n\nThat's 0.02MP = 15.\n\nSo solving for MP: MP = 15 / 0.02 = 750. Wait, that gives me 750. Let me check the options. Option D is 750. Hmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here?\n\nWait, let me go through again. The difference between the two selling prices is 2% of the marked price, which equals the 15 rupees decrease in profit. Because the cost price is constant, the difference in SP is exactly the difference in profit. So yes, that's correct. So 2% of MP is 15, so MP is 15 divided by 0.02, which is 750. So the answer should be D?\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options given are A)697.50, B)712.50, C)787.50, D)750, E)780. So D is 750. That seems straightforward. Hmm. But maybe I missed something?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the interpretation. Let me read the question again to confirm. The problem states that when he gives 7% discount instead of 5%, his profit is Rs.15 less. So the difference in the selling prices (SP1 - SP2) is equal to 15, since the cost price is same. SP1 is higher than SP2 by 2% of MP, so that difference is 2% of MP equals 15. So yes, that gives MP = 750. So D is the answer. \n\nWait but let me see if any of the other options could be correct if there's a different approach. For instance, maybe the problem is considering something else, like profit percentage instead of absolute profit? But the question says \"earns Rs.15 less as profit,\" which is an absolute difference, so my approach should be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate 15 divided by 0.02. 0.02 times 750 is 15, yes. 750 * 0.02 is 15. So that's correct. So the answer must be D) Rs.750. \n\nHmm, but wait the options have C as 787.50. Maybe I need to check again. Let me think if there's another way. Let me try plugging in the options to see.\n\nSuppose the marked price is D)750. \n\nThen 5% discount: selling price is 750 *0.95 = 712.50. \n\n7% discount: 750 *0.93 = 750 - 52.5 = 697.50. \n\nThe difference between the two selling prices is 712.50 - 697.50 = 15. So exactly 15. So that's the case. So the profit difference is indeed 15. So that's correct. \n\nSo the answer is D. \n\nWait the options include D as 750, so that's correct. Therefore the answer is D.\n",
