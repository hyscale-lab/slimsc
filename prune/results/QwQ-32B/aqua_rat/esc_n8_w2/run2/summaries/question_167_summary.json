      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out how long it'll take both printers working together to print 100 pages. Let me read the question again. Printer A and Printer B each can print 1/2 a page per second. Hmm, right. So each one's rate is 0.5 pages per second.\n\nWait, when they work together, their rates should add up, right? Like if one does 0.5 and the other also 0.5, together they make 1 page per second. Oh, that makes sense. So combined, their total rate is 1 page every second.\n\nNow the question is, how long to print 100 pages at that combined rate. Time is equal to total work divided by rate. So time = 100 pages divided by 1 page per second. That would be 100 seconds. Wait, but let me check the options. Option C is 100 seconds. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it step by step. Let's see. The rate of each printer is 1/2 page per second. So in one second, Printer A does 0.5 pages, Printer B does 0.5. Together, 1 page per second. So yes, that's correct. So for 100 pages, time would be 100 divided by 1, which is 100 seconds. So the answer would be C. But hold on, let me check the options again. The options are A)25, B)50, C)100, D)200, E)400. Hmm, but maybe I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe I need to use the formula for combined work rates?\n\nThe formula is 1/A + 1/B = 1/T or something? Wait no, the formula is when you have rates. Let me recall. The combined rate is the sum of individual rates. So each printer's rate is 1/2 pages per second. So combined rate R = (1/2 + 1/2) = 1 page per second. Then time T = total pages / R. So T = 100 / 1 = 100 seconds. So that's C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that since each takes 2 seconds per page, so together they take 1 second per page. So for 100 pages, 100 seconds. Yeah that matches. So the answer must be C. But let me see if any of the options are different. The options include C as 100, so that's correct. Wait, but maybe the question is a trick question. Like, maybe they can't work simultaneously on the same page or something? But the question says \"print 100 pages\" so I think they can work together by each doing separate pages. So the combined rate is indeed 1 per second. So the answer is C. Hmm, but let me check again. Suppose each printer does 0.5 pages per second. So in one second, together they make 1 page. So after t seconds, they make t pages. To get 100 pages, t must be 100. Yeah, that's right. So the correct answer is C.\n",

But no, when working together, their rates just add. So combined rate is indeed 1 page per second. So 100 pages would take 100 seconds. \n\nLooking at the options, C is 100. So the answer must be C. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula: 1/A + 1/B = 1/T or something? Wait no, that's for when you have times and you need to find combined time. Wait, the standard formula is:\n\nIf Printer A can do a job in tA time, and Printer B in tB, then their rates are 1/tA and 1/tB. Combined rate is 1/tA +1/tB, so total time is 1/(sum). \n\nWait, but in this problem, they already give the rates. Each printer's rate is 1/2 page per second. So adding the rates gives 1 page per second. So total time for 100 pages is 100 divided by 1, which is 100 seconds. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer is C. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is a trick question. Like, maybe when working together, they can't both print the same page at the same time, so they just split the pages? But even then, splitting the pages between them, each printer would do 50 pages. Each printer takes 1 second per page (since 0.5 pages per second is 2 seconds per page?), wait wait a second. Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, if a printer can print 1/2 a page per second, that means that to print one full page, it takes 2 seconds. Because 1/(1/2) is 2. So each printer's time per page is 2 seconds. So for one printer to do 100 pages, it would take 200 seconds. But when working together, their combined rate is 1 page per second, so 100 pages take 100 seconds. That still holds. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the units? The question says 1/2 page per second. So yes, adding the two gives 1 page per second. So 100 pages would take 100 seconds, so option C. \n\nHmm, the options given are A)25, B)50, C)100, D)200, E)400. So 100 is an option. I think I'm confident that's the right answer.
