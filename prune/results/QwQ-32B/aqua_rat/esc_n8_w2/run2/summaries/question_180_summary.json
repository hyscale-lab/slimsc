      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So the question is about the revenue from novels compared to biographies for Ace Book Company. Hmm, let me read it again carefully.\n\nAlright, last year, 34% of their sales revenue was from novels. The remaining revenue, which would be 100% - 34% = 66%, right? Then, of that remaining 66%, a third was from biographies. Wait, so the biographies part is 1/3 of the remaining 66%? Let me make sure I get that right.\n\nSo first, the novels are 34%, so the rest is 66%. The problem says of the remaining revenue (so that 66%), 1/3 was from biographies. So biographies are (1/3)*66%? Let me calculate that. 66 divided by 3 is 22. So biographies make up 22% of total revenue?\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many times the revenue from novels is compared to biographies. So novels are 34%, biographies are 22%, so 34 divided by 22. Let me do that division. 34 divided by 22. Let's see, 22 times 1.5 is 33, so 1.5 would give 33. So 34 divided by 22 would be a little over 1.5. Let me compute it exactly: 34/22 = 1.545... Approximately, so that's around 1.55. Hmm, looking at the options, option B is 1.5 and C is 2.1. Wait, but 1.55 is closer to 1.5 or 2.1? Well, 1.55 is 1.5 and a half, so maybe the question says \"approximately\" so which is the closest?\n\nWait, the options are A)1.3, B)1.5, C)2.1, D)2.5, E)3.1. So 1.545 is approximately 1.5, so B. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, hold on. The remaining revenue after novels is 66%. The problem says that of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from biographies. So that's 1/3 of 66%, which is indeed 22%. So novels are 34% and biographies are 22%. So 34 divided by 22 equals approximately 1.545. The options have B as 1.5 and C as 2.1. Since 1.545 is closer to 1.5 than to 2.1, so the answer should be B. But let me check again to make sure I didn't misread the question.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the remaining part. Let me recheck:\n\nTotal revenue: 100%.\n\nNovels: 34%, so remaining is 66%.\n\nOf that remaining 66%, 1/3 is biographies. So biographies are (1/3)*66 = 22. So yes. So novels are 34, biographies 22. The question is asking how many times the novel revenue is compared to biography. So 34/22 is the ratio. Let me calculate 34 divided by 22 again. 22*1.5 is 33, so 34 is 1 more, so 1.5 + (1/22) \u2248 1.545. So approximately 1.5 times. The closest is B. So the answer is B. \n\nWait, but let me make sure that the remaining revenue after novels is considered. Let me think again. Suppose total revenue is $100 for simplicity. Novels: $34. Remaining is $66. Of that $66, 1/3 is biographies. So biographies are 66*(1/3) = $22. So novels are $34 vs. $22 for biographies. So 34/22 = 1.545... So yeah, approximately 1.5 times. So B is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says \"how many times its revenue from the sale of biographies\" \u2014 so novels are X times biographies. So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be B)1.5.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many times the revenue from novels is compared to biographies, we start by noting that novels accounted for 34% of total revenue.
