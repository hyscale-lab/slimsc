      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about three bells ringing at intervals of 36, 40, and 48 seconds. The question is asking when they'll all ring together again after starting at the same time. Hmm, right. I think this is a least common multiple (LCM) problem. Because LCM of their intervals would give the next time they all coincide.\n\nLet me remember how to compute LCM. Oh right, you can do it by prime factorization. Let me try that.\n\nFirst, break down each number into its prime factors.\n\nStarting with 36. Let's see, 36 divided by 2 is 18, then 2 again is 9, then 3 squared. So 36 is 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2.\n\nNext, 40. 40 divided by 2 is 20, again 2 is 10, again 2 is 5. So that's 2\u00b3 \u00d7 5\u00b9.\n\nThen 48. 48 divided by 2 is 24, then 2 again 12, then 6, then 3. So that's 2\u2074 \u00d7 3\u00b9.\n\nTo find LCM, take the highest power of each prime number present. So for 2, the highest exponent is 4 (from 48). For 3, the highest is 2 (from 36). And for 5, it's 1 (from 40). So LCM is 2\u2074 \u00d7 3\u00b2 \u00d7 5\u00b9.\n\nCalculating that: 2\u2074 is 16, 3\u00b2 is 9, 5 is 5. Multiply them all together. Let's do 16 \u00d7 9 first. 16*9 is 144. Then 144 \u00d75 is 720. So LCM is 720 seconds.\n\nWait, the options are in minutes. Let me convert seconds to minutes. 720 divided by 60 is 12 minutes. So that would be option B, right?\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let me make sure I did the LCM correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can check by another method. Let's see:\n\nThe LCM of 36 and 40 first. Let's see, 36 factors into 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2, 40 is 2\u00b3\u00d75. LCM of those two would be 2\u00b3 \u00d73\u00b2 \u00d75 = 8\u00d79\u00d75= 360. Then LCM of that with 48. So LCM(360,48). Let's do their factors:\n\n360 is 2\u00b3\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75, and 48 is 2\u2074\u00d73. The LCM would take the max exponents: 2\u2074, 3\u00b2, and 5. So 16\u00d79\u00d75 = 720 again. Yep, same result. So 720 seconds is 12 minutes. So the answer should be B.\n\nWait the options are: A)6, B)12, C)18, D)24, E) none. So B is an option. So the answer is B. Unless I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check once again.\n\nWait, let's think of the actual times. Suppose they start at time 0. The first bell rings at 0,36,72,... The second at 0,40,80,... The third at 0,48,96,... When do they all coincide again? The first common time after 0 would be LCM(36,40,48) which we found as 720. 720 seconds divided by 60 is 12 minutes. So that's correct. So the answer is B. Therefore the correct option is B.
