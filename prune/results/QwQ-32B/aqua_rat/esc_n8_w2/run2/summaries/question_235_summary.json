      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the actual selling price after a discount. Hmm, wait, the question says Vinit bought an article for Rs.4578 during a sale where there's a 20% discount on all items. They want to know the actual selling price before the discount, right?\n\nWait a second, maybe I need to clarify terms here. The actual selling price might refer to the original price before the discount. Because the selling price after the discount is what Vinit paid, which is 4578. So the question is probably asking for the original marked price. Let me confirm the terms. \n\nIn retail terms, the \"actual selling price\" might be a bit confusing. But typically, the selling price is what the customer pays. But here, since there's a discount, the original price (the listed price) would be higher, and the discounted price is 80% of that. So the 4578 is 80% of the original price. So to find the original price, we can calculate 4578 divided by 0.8.\n\nLet me do that math. Let's see, 4578 divided by 0.8. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 4578 divided by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 10/8, which simplifies to 5/4. Wait, no, 10 divided by 8 is 5/4? Wait no. Wait 1 divided by 0.8 is 1.25, right? Because 0.8 times 1.25 is 1. So 4578 * 1.25 would give the original price. \n\nCalculating that: 4578 * 1.25. Let's break it down. 4578 * 1 is 4578, and 4578 * 0.25 is 1144.5. Adding those together: 4578 + 1144.5 equals 5722.5. Hmm, so that would round to 5722.5, which is close to option B, 5723. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)5050, B)5723, C)5040, D)4950, E)4870. So B is 5723. That's very close to 5722.5. So that must be the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me double-check the calculation. Let me do 4578 divided by 0.8 again. \n\nAnother way: 20% off means the customer pays 80%, so original price = (sale price) / 0.8. \n\nLet me compute 4578 divided by 0.8. \n\nDividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 1.25. So 4578 * 1.25. Let's do this step by step. \n\n4578 * 1 = 4578. \n\n4578 * 0.25 = (4578 / 4) = 1144.5. \n\nAdding them gives 4578 + 1144.5 = 5722.5. So yes, that's exactly 5722.5, which would be Rs.5722.5. Since the options are in whole numbers, the closest is 5723, which is option B. \n\nWait, but maybe I misread the question. The question says \"actual selling price\". Wait, maybe the \"actual selling price\" is the price after discount? That wouldn't make sense because the selling price is what the customer paid. But the problem states that he purchased it for 4578, so that's the selling price. But then why is the question asking for the actual selling price? Hmm, maybe there's confusion in terminology here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is using \"actual selling price\" to mean the original price before discount. Because sometimes in such problems, the \"marked price\" is the original, and the selling price after discount is the final. So in that case, the answer is B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to check if the question is in another way. Let me re-read the question again. \n\n\"In a sale, a discount of 20% was available on all the articles. If Vinit purchased an article for Rs.4578 in the sale. What was the actual selling price of the article?\"\n\nWait, maybe the term \"actual selling price\" here refers to the price after discount, which is 4578. But that can't be, because that's what he paid. So perhaps the question is phrased incorrectly, and they mean the original price (marked price) before discount. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term \"actual selling price\" is a translation issue. Maybe in the problem's original language, it's clearer. But given the options, B is the only one that fits when calculating as I did. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check again. \n\nLet me try another approach. Let the original price be X. \n\nAfter 20% discount, the sale price is X - 20% of X = 80% of X. \n\nSo 0.8 X = 4578. \n\nSo X = 4578 / 0.8 = 5722.5, which rounds to 5723. So the answer must be B. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the original price (actual selling price before the discount), we know Vinit paid Rs. 4578 after a 20% discount.

The question is asking for the actual selling price before the discount, right? Or wait, maybe I need to clarify what exactly the terms here mean. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the wording says \"actual selling price\". Wait, sometimes in these problems, the \"actual selling price\" might refer to the original price before the discount, and the sale price is the discounted one. Because the selling price after discount is what Vinit paid, which is 4578. So the original price (the marked price) would be higher. The question is probably asking for that original price. Because the discount is applied to the original selling price, leading to the sale price.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the terms are different. Let me make sure. The problem states \"discount of 20% was available on all the articles\". So the discount is off the original price. So the actual selling price before discount is the original price, and the sale price is after the discount. So Vinit paid 80% of the original price (since 20% was discounted). So we need to find the original price. \n\nThe formula would be: Sale price = Original price \u00d7 (1 - discount rate). Here, the discount is 20%, so 1 - 0.2 = 0.8. So 4578 = Original \u00d7 0.8. Therefore, Original = 4578 / 0.8. Let me calculate that.\n\nLet me do that division. 4578 divided by 0.8. Well, dividing by 0.8 is the same as multiplying by 10/8, which simplifies to 5/4. So 4578 \u00d7 (5/4)? Wait, wait, no. Wait 0.8 is 4/5, so dividing by 4/5 is multiplying by 5/4. Right. So 4578 \u00d7 5 /4. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 4578 \u00d75. Let's see: 4000 \u00d75 =20,000. 500 \u00d75 is 2500, so 4500\u00d75 is 22,500. Then 78 \u00d75 is 390. So total is 22,500 +390 =22,890. Then divide by 4. 22,890 divided by 4. Let's see: 22,890 divided by 4. 22,880 divided by 4 is 5,720, and then 10/4 is 2.5. So total is 5,720 + 2.5 =5,722.5? Wait, but that's not matching the options. Wait, the options are given as:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) 5050\n\nB) 5723\n\nC) 5040\n\nD)4950\n\nE)4870\n\nHmm. Wait, so 5,722.5 is close to option B, which is 5723. But let me check my calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate 4578 \u00d75. Let me do it step by step. 4578 \u00d75:\n\n4000 \u00d75 =20,000\n\n500 \u00d75 =2,500 \u2192 20,000 +2,500 =22,500\n\n70 \u00d75 =350 \u2192 22,500 + 350 =22,850\n\n8 \u00d75 =40 \u2192 22,850 +40 =22,890. So that part is correct. Then dividing by 4 gives 22,890 /4 =5,722.5. So that's 5722.5. But the options have B as 5723. So that would be the answer. So the actual original price is 5722.5, which rounds to 5723, so option B. \n\nWait but the options are in whole numbers, so maybe the calculation is precise. Let me see if I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the problem's wording.

Wait, the term \"actual selling price\" might be the price before discount, because the sale price is the discounted one. But maybe the question is phrased differently.
