      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about some friends going on a picnic and adjusting their contributions when some don't show up. Hmm, I need to find out how many actually attended. Let me think.\n\nAlright, the total amount they planned to spend was Rs. 96. Originally, a certain number of friends were supposed to go, but four didn't come. Because of that, each of the remaining friends had to pay 4 rupees more. The question is asking for the number who attended. The options are given, so maybe I can set up an equation here.\n\nLet me denote the original number of friends as, say, x. Then, the number who actually attended would be x minus 4, right? Because four didn't come. \n\nThe original cost per person would be the total divided by the original number, which is 96/x. But when four didn't come, the new cost per person became 96 divided by (x - 4). According to the problem, this new cost is 4 rupees more than the original. So the equation would be:\n\n96/(x - 4) = (96/x) + 4\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Let me write that down properly. \n\nSo, rearranging the equation to solve for x. Let's subtract 96/x from both sides:\n\n96/(x - 4) - 96/x = 4\n\nTo combine the fractions on the left, I need a common denominator, which would be x(x - 4). Let me compute the numerator:\n\n96x - 96(x - 4) all over x(x -4) equals 4. \n\nExpanding the numerator: 96x -96x + 384 = 384. So the equation becomes:\n\n384 / [x(x -4)] = 4\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x-4):\n\n384 = 4x(x -4)\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 96 = x(x-4)\n\nSo x squared minus 4x minus 96 equals zero. Let me write that equation:\n\nx\u00b2 -4x -96 =0\n\nNow I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let's try factoring. The product of the constants in the factors should be -96 and add to -4. Hmm. Let's see factors of 96. Let's see, 12 and 8: 12-8 is 4. Wait, if we have (x - 12)(x +8) then expanding gives x\u00b2 +8x -12x -96 = x\u00b2-4x -96. Yes! That works. \n\nSo the equation factors to (x -12)(x +8)=0. Therefore, solutions are x=12 or x=-8. Since the number of people can't be negative, x must be 12. \n\nWait, but x was the original number of friends. The question asks for the number who attended, which is x-4. So 12-4=8. So the answer would be 8, which is option A. \n\nBut hold on, let me check again. Let me plug back into the original scenario to confirm. If original number was 12, each was supposed to pay 96/12=8 rupees. But when 4 didn't come, 8 people attended. Then each paid 96/8=12. The difference is 12-8=4, which matches the problem's statement. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, but wait the options include 8 as option A, so that's the answer. But wait, I remember sometimes there might be a trick here. Let me think again. Did I mix up the original and attended numbers?\n\nWait, the original number was x=12. So the ones who attended are 8. So the answer is A. But let me check another option. Let's see option B is 12, which would be the original number, so that's not it. So yeah, the answer must be A)8. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me double-check the equation. The new contribution is original plus 4. So yes, 96/(x-4) = (96/x) +4. That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a bit different. Let me see again. The total is fixed at 96, right? So the total amount didn't change. The four people not coming caused each attendee to pay 4 more. So yes, the equation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 8, which is option A. Wait, but wait a second. Let me check another possible way. Suppose the number who attended is y. Then original number would be y +4. Let me try that approach. \n\nLet me try this way. Let the number of attendees be y. So original number was y +4. Then original cost per person was 96/(y+4), and the new cost is 96/y. The difference is 4. So:\n\n96/y - 96/(y+4) =4 \n\nThat's the same equation but variables swapped. Let me see solving this way:\n\nMultiply through: 96[(1/y) - 1/(y+4)] =4 \n\nCompute the left part: 96 [ (y+4 - y)/ y(y+4) ) ] =4 \n\nSo 96*(4) / [y(y+4)] =4 \n\nWhich gives 384 / [y(y+4)] =4 \n\nMultiply both sides by y(y+4): 384=4y(y+4)\n\nDivide by 4: 96 = y(y+4)\n\nSo y\u00b2 +4y -96 =0 \n\nSolving quadratic: y\u00b2 +4y -96=0. Let's factor. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -96 and add to +4. Let's see 12 and -8: 12 * (-8)= -96, 12-8=4. So factors would be (y+12)(y-8)=0. Solutions y= -12 or 8. So y=8. So same answer. \n\nSo whether I set up with original x or attendees y, I get that the attendees are 8. So answer is A. \n\nHmm, so the options have A as 8. So that must be the correct answer. I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. So I'll go with A)8.\n",

The question is about some friends going on a picnic and adjusting their contributions when some people don't show up. Hmm.\n\nSo the total amount they planned to spend was Rs. 96. Originally, a certain number of friends were going to split this cost. But four didn't come, so the remaining people had to pay 4 rupees extra each. We need to find out how many actually attended.\n\nLet me set up variables. Let's let the original number of friends be x. Then, each was supposed to contribute 96 divided by x, right? So original contribution per person is 96/x.\n\nBut then four didn't come, so the number who attended is x - 4. Now each had to pay 4 more, so their new contribution is (96/(x-4)). And this new amount is equal to the original plus 4. So equation would be:\n\n96/(x - 4) = (96/x) + 4\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Now I need to solve for x. Once I find x, subtract 4 to get the number who attended. Let's work through the equation.\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x-4) to eliminate denominators. So:\n\n96x = 96(x -4) +4x(x-4)\n\nLet me expand the right side. 96(x-4) is 96x - 384. Then plus 4x(x-4) which is 4x\u00b2 -16x. Wait, no, actually the equation after multiplying both sides would be:\n\nLeft side: 96x(x-4) ?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, original equation:\n\n96/(x -4) = (96/x) +4\n\nMultiply both sides by x(x-4):\n\n96x = 96(x -4) +4x(x-4)\n\nYes, that's right. Let me expand each term:\n\nLeft side: 96x.\n\nRight side: 96x - 96*4 +4x(x-4). \n\nCalculating 96*4 is 384. So:\n\nRight side becomes 96x - 384 +4x\u00b2 -16x. \n\nCombine like terms. Let's see, 96x -16x is 80x. So the right side is 4x\u00b2 +80x -384.\n\nNow, bringing all terms to one side:\n\n96x = 4x\u00b2 +80x -384\n\nSubtract 96x from both sides:\n\n0 =4x\u00b2 +80x -384 -96x\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n80x -96x is -16x. So:\n\n0 =4x\u00b2 -16x -384\n\nDivide all terms by 4 to simplify:\n\n0 =x\u00b2 -4x -96\n\nSo the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -4x -96 =0.\n\nNow, solving for x. Let's use quadratic formula. x = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] /2\n\nBecause discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. Here a=1, b=-4, c=-96. So discriminant is (-4)^2 -4(1)(-96) = 16 + 384 = 400.\n\nSo sqrt(400) is 20. So x = [4 +20]/2 or [4-20]/2.\n\nFirst solution: 24/2=12. Second: (-16)/2= -8. Since number can't be negative, x=12.\n\nWait, so original number of friends was 12. But four didn't come, so the number who attended is 12-4=8. Wait, but option A is 8. But let me check again. Wait the options are given, and option A is 8, B is 12, etc. Wait, but the question asks for the number who attended, so 8? But that might not be right. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, let me verify with the numbers. Let's see: if original was 12 people, each would pay 96/12=8 rupees. But when 4 don't come, 8 people attend. Then each would pay 96/8=12. The difference is 12-8=4, which matches the problem's statement. So yes, that works. So the answer is 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check why I thought maybe another answer. Because sometimes I might have messed up the equations. Let me see another way. Let me assume the answer is 8 (A). Let's see:\n\nSuppose the attendees are 8. Then original number would have been 12 (since 8+4=12). Original contribution per person 96/12=8. New contribution 96/8=12. The difference is 4. That's correct. So answer A is correct. \n\nBut wait, the options given include 8 as A. Hmm. Wait, but sometimes when I set up variables, maybe I made an error. Let me try another approach. Let me let the number who attended be y. Then the original number was y +4. \n\nSo original contribution per person: 96/(y+4). The new contribution is 96/y. The difference is 4, so:\n\n96/y -96/(y+4) =4.\n\nThis is another way to set up the equation. Let me solve this equation. Maybe this is easier.\n\nMultiply both sides by y(y+4):\n\n96(y+4) -96y =4y(y+4)\n\nLeft side: 96y + 384 -96y = 384.\n\nRight side:4y\u00b2 +16y.\n\nSo equation: 384=4y\u00b2 +16y\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 96 = y\u00b2 +4y\n\nSo y\u00b2 +4y -96 =0.\n\nSolving quadratic equation y\u00b2 +4y -96 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: y = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] /2\n\nsqrt(400)=20. So y = (-4 +20)/2 =16/2=8. The other solution is negative. So y=8. So the answer is A)8. That matches.\n\nHmm, so the correct answer is A)8. But let me check the options again. The options given are A)8, B)12, etc. So that's correct. Wait but why do I feel like maybe I made a mistake here? Let me think again.\n\nWait another way: Suppose the answer was 12 (B). Then original number would have been 16 (since 12+4=16). Original contribution 96/16=6. Then new contribution would be 96/12=8. The difference is 2, but the problem states 4. So that's not right. So 12 is not correct. \n\nIf the answer was 16 (C), then original number was 20. Original contribution 96/20=4.8. New contribution 96/16=6. The difference is 1.2, which isn't 4. So no.\n\nIf the answer was 24 (D), original number was 28. 96/28\u22483.428, new is 96/24=4. Difference 0.57. Not 4.\n\nSo yes, 8 is correct. So the answer is A. So the correct option is A.\n",

So the right side is 4x\u00b2 +80x -384.\n\nNow, bringing all terms to one side:\n\n96x = 4x\u00b2 +80x -384\n\nSubtract 96x from both sides:\n\n0 =4x\u00b2 +80x -384 -96x\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\n80x -96x is -16x. So:\n\n0 =4x\u00b2 -16x -384\n\nDivide all terms by 4 to simplify:\n\n0 =x\u00b2 -4x -96\n\nSo the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 -4x -96 =0.\n\nNow, solving for x. Let's use quadratic formula. x = [4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] /2\n\nBecause discriminant is b\u00b2-4ac. Here a=1, b=-4, c=-96. So discriminant is (-4)^2 -4(1)(-96) = 16 + 384 = 400.\n\nSo sqrt(400) is 20. So x = [4 +20]/2 or [4-20]/2.\n\nFirst solution: 24/2=12. Second: (-16)/2= -8. Since number can't be negative, x=12.\n\nWait, so original number of friends was 12. But four didn't come, so the number who attended is 12-4=8. Wait, but option A is 8. But let me check again. Wait the options are given, and option A is 8, B is 12, etc. Wait, but the question asks for the number who attended, so 8? But that might not be right. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, let me verify with the numbers. Let's see: if original was 12 people, each would pay 96/12=8 rupees. But when 4 don't come, 8 people attend. Then each would pay 96/8=12. The difference is 12-8=4, which matches the problem's statement. So yes, that works. So the answer is 8, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me check why I thought maybe another answer. Because sometimes I might have messed up the equations. Let me see another way. Let me assume the answer is 8 (A). Let's see:\n\nSuppose the attendees are 8. Then original number would have been 12 (since 8+4=12). Original contribution per person 96/12=8. New contribution 96/8=12. The difference is 4. That's correct. So answer A is correct. \n\nBut wait, the options given include 8 as A. Hmm. Wait, but sometimes when I set up variables, maybe I made an error. Let me try another approach. Let me let the number who attended be y. Then the original number was y +4. \n\nSo original contribution per person: 96/(y+4). The new contribution is 96/y. The difference is 4, so:\n\n96/y -96/(y+4) =4.\n\nThis is another way to set up the equation. Let me solve this equation. Maybe this is easier.\n\nMultiply both sides by y(y+4):\n\n96(y+4) -96y =4y(y+4)\n\nLeft side: 96y + 384 -96y = 384.\n\nRight side:4y\u00b2 +16y.\n\nSo equation: 384=4y\u00b2 +16y\n\nDivide both sides by 4: 96 = y\u00b2 +4y\n\nSo y\u00b2 +4y -96 =0.\n\nSolving quadratic equation y\u00b2 +4y -96 =0.\n\nUsing quadratic formula: y = [-4 \u00b1 sqrt(16 + 384)] /2\n\nsqrt(400)=20. So y = (-4 +20)/2 =16/2=8. The other solution is negative. So y=8. So the answer is A)8. That matches.\n\nHmm, so the correct answer is A)8. But let me check the options again. The options given are A)8, B)12, etc. So that's correct. Wait but why do I feel like maybe I made a mistake here? Let me think again.\n\nWait another way: Suppose the answer was 12 (B). Then original number would have been 16 (since 12+4=16). Original contribution 96/16=6. Then new contribution would be 96/12=8. The difference is 2, but the problem states 4. So that's not right. So 12 is not correct. \n\nIf the answer was 16 (C), then original number was 20. Original contribution 96/20=4.8. New contribution 96/16=6. The difference is 1.2, which isn't 4. So no.\n\nIf the answer was 24 (D), original number was 28. 96/28\u22483.428, new is 96/24=4. Difference 0.57. Not 4.\n\nSo yes, 8 is correct. So the answer is A. So the correct option is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote the original number of friends as \\( x \\). Each was supposed to contribute \\( \\frac{96}{x} \\) rupees. When four friends didn't attend, the remaining \\( x - 4 \\) friends each contributed \\( \\frac{96}{x - 4} \\) rupees, which is 4 rupees more than the original amount. This gives the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{96}{x - 4} = \\frac{96}{x} + 4\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by \\( x(x - 4) \\) to eliminate denominators:\n\n\\[\n96x = 96(x - 4) + 4x(x - 4)\n\\]\n\nExpanding and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n96x = 96x - 384 + 4x^2 - 16x\n\\]\n\n\\[\n0 = 4x^2 - 16x - 384\n\\]\n\nDividing by 4:\n\n\\[\nx^2 - 4x - 96 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 + 384}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 20}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe positive solution is \\( x = 12 \\), meaning the original number of friends was 12. Since four didn't attend, the number who attended is \\( 12 - 4 = 8 \\).\n\nVerification: Original contribution per person was \\( \\frac{96}{12} = 8 \\) rupees. After four didn't attend, each paid \\( \\frac{96}{8} = 12 \\) rupees, a difference of 4 rupees, confirming the solution is correct.\n\nAnswer: A) 8.\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\nAnswer: A)8.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{A}\n\nAnswer: A)8.\n\nAnswer: $A\n\nWait, the system requires the exact format. Let me make sure.\n\nThe problem asks for the number who attended. The correct answer is 8, which is option A. The instructions say to conclude with 'Answer: $LETTER'. So:\n\nAnswer: A\n\nYes.\n\nAnswer: A",
