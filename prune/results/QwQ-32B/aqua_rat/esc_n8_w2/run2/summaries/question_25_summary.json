      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about Bill's bicycle speed on a normal day and a windy day. I need to find out how far he can travel in 21 minutes on a windy day. Hmm, right. \n\nFirst, the normal speed is 15 mph. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So his speed on a windy day would be 15 minus 4, which is 11 mph. Wait, that makes sense. So his speed is 11 mph when it's windy. \n\nNow, the question is asking for the distance he can travel in 21 minutes. Oh right, time, speed, distance. The formula I remember is distance equals speed multiplied by time. But wait, the time here is in minutes, and the speed is in hours. So I need to convert the time to hours. \n\n21 minutes is what fraction of an hour? Since 60 minutes are in an hour, 21 divided by 60. Let me calculate that. 21 divided by 60 equals 0.35 hours. \n\nSo now, using the formula: distance = speed \u00d7 time. His speed on a windy day is 11 mph, multiplied by 0.35 hours. Let me do that multiplication. 11 times 0.35. Hmm, 11 times 0.3 is 3.3, and 11 times 0.05 is 0.55. Adding those together: 3.3 + 0.55 equals 3.85. Wait, that would give 3.85 miles. But looking at the options, D is 3.85. But wait, let me check again because maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. \n\nWait, 11 multiplied by 0.35. Let me do it another way. 0.35 times 10 is 3.5, and 0.35 times 1 is 0.35. So adding those gives 3.5 + 0.35 = 3.85. Yeah, that's the same. So the answer would be D) 3.85? But let me check the options again. The options are A)2, B)2.25, C)3.25, D)3.85, E)2.85. \n\nWait a second, maybe I messed up the speed. The problem says his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So original is 15, so 15-4 is indeed 11. So that part is correct. Time conversion is correct, 21/60 is 0.35 hours. So 11 * 0.35 is indeed 3.85. So then D is the answer. But wait, the options include E as 2.85. Maybe I made an error in subtraction? Let me check again. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me read it again. \"On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph.\" So yes, 15 minus 4 is 11. So the speed is correct. \n\nHmm, so why is there an option E? Maybe I made a mistake in calculation steps. Let me recalculate 11 * 0.35 again. \n\n11 * 0.35: 0.35 is the same as 35/100, so 11 * 35 = 385, divided by 100 is 3.85. So that's correct. So the answer should be D. But let me check if the question says \"reduced by 4 mph\" or \"reduced to 4 mph\". Oh, the wording is \"reduced by\", so subtraction. So that's right. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for rounding to the nearest hundredth. Let me see. 3.85 is already to the hundredth place. So no problem. So D would be the answer. But looking at the options again, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. The options are A through E, and D is 3.85. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, but I thought sometimes these questions might trick you with time. Let me confirm once more. 21 minutes is 21/60 hours, which is 0.35 hours. 11 mph multiplied by 0.35 hours is 3.85 miles. So the answer must be D. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's details. Let me check the problem again. \n\nThe problem says, \"how far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes?\" So yes, that's exactly what I did. So I think the answer is D. But the options have E as 2.85, which is 10 times 0.285, but maybe someone miscalculates. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, maybe I confused mph with something else? No, mph is miles per hour, so the calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the wind reduces his speed to 4 mph? Wait, that would make the answer 4 * 0.35 = 1.4, which isn't an option. So no. The question clearly says \"reduced by 4 mph\", so subtraction. \n\nHmm, I think the correct answer is D) 3.85. So I'll go with that.\n",

Alright, first, I need to remember the basic formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time. Right, distance equals speed times time. \n\nSo, normally Bill goes 15 mph. But on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. So I need to subtract 4 from 15 to get his windy day speed. Let me do that: 15 minus 4 is 11. So his speed on a windy day is 11 mph. Got that part.\n\nNow the time given is 21 minutes. Wait, the speed is in hours, so I have to convert the time into hours. Because the units have to match. Oh right, 21 minutes is like a fraction of an hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 21 minutes would be 21/60 hours. Let me calculate that. 21 divided by 60. Hmm, 21 divided by 60... Well, that's 0.35 hours. Because 21 divided by 60 equals 0.35. Let me check that again. 60 times 0.35 is 21, yes. So that's correct.\n\nNow multiply the speed by the time. So 11 mph times 0.35 hours. Let me do that multiplication. 11 * 0.35. Let me think: 10 times 0.35 is 3.5, and 1 times 0.35 is 0.35. So adding those together, 3.5 + 0.35 equals 3.85. Wait, so that would give 3.85 miles. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate. Alternatively, maybe 0.35 times 11. Let me do it another way. 0.35 is the same as 35/100. So 35/100 *11 = (35*11)/100. 35*10 is 350, plus 35 is 385. So 385 divided by 100 is 3.85. Yeah, that's right. So the distance is 3.85 miles. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 3.85. But wait, let me double-check everything again because sometimes I might have messed up a step. \n\nOriginal speed: 15 mph. Wind reduces by 4, so 15-4=11. Correct. Time is 21 minutes, which is 21/60 hours. That's 0.35. Multiply 11 *0.35. Yes, that's 3.85. So the answer should be D? But wait the options given are A)2, B)2.25, C)3.25, D)3.85, E)2.85. So D is an option. \n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake in the time conversion? Let me confirm again. 21 divided by 60. Let me compute it as a decimal. 21 divided by 60. 60 goes into 21 0.35 times. Because 0.3 hours is 18 minutes (0.3*60=18), and 0.05 hours is 3 minutes, so 0.35 is 21. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question? Like, maybe the wind reduces his speed to 4 mph instead of subtracting 4? Wait, the problem says \"speed is reduced by 4 mph\". So that's a subtraction. So 15-4=11. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, then the answer should be D. But wait, looking at the options, E is 2.85. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me check again. 11 multiplied by 0.35. Let's do it step by step. 11 times 0.3 is 3.3, and 11 times 0.05 is 0.55. Adding those gives 3.3+0.55 = 3.85. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. So then the answer must be D. But wait, maybe the question says \"reduced by 4 mph\" but that's only when he's going against the wind? Or is the total speed? Wait the problem says \"on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph\". So I think it's straightforward: his speed becomes 15-4 =11 mph. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me read again. \n\n\"On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.\"\n\nYes, that's exactly what it says. So the calculation is correct. So the answer is D. But wait, the options given include D as 3.85, so that's the correct choice. \n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes people might think the reduction is a percentage or something, but the problem clearly states \"reduced by 4 mph\", so it's a flat subtraction. So yeah, I think D is correct. Let me check again the options. Option D is 3.85, which matches our calculation. So the answer should be D. But I need to make sure I didn't make a mistake in any step. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant that the wind causes his speed to be 4 mph less than his normal speed, but perhaps the time is in minutes and I have to convert it correctly. Wait, yes, time in hours. 21 minutes is 0.35 hours. So 11 * 0.35 is indeed 3.85. So yeah, I think D is correct. \n\nHmm, but let me check again. Wait, maybe I added wrong? Let me compute 11 * 0.35. 0.35 is 35/100. 11*35 is 385. Divided by 100 gives 3.85. Yep. So that's right. So the answer must be D.\n",
