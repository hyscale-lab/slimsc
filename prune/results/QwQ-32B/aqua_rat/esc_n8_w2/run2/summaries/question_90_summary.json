      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. I need to solve this problem about profit percentages. Hmm, the question says a book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit. Then, if it's sold for 25.75, what's the new profit or loss percentage?\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the cost price. Because profit percentage is calculated based on the cost price. Right, the original selling price gives a 10% profit. So, the formula for selling price when there's a profit is: Selling Price = Cost Price + (Profit% of Cost Price). \n\nLet me write that down. Let the cost price be CP. Then, when sold at 27.50, the profit is 10% of CP. So:\n\nSP = CP * (1 + Profit%) \n\nWait, actually, the formula is SP = CP \u00d7 (1 + profit percentage in decimal). Since profit is 10%, that's 0.10. So:\n\n27.50 = CP \u00d7 1.10 \n\nSo, to find CP, divide 27.50 by 1.10. Let me calculate that. \n\n27.50 divided by 1.1. Let's see, 1.1 times 25 is 27.5, right? Because 25*1.1 is 27.5. Wait yes! So the cost price must be Rs 25. \n\nWait, so CP is 25. \n\nNow, the second part: if the book is sold for 25.75, what's the profit or loss percentage?\n\nSo the new selling price is 25.75. Since the cost price is 25, the selling price here is 25.75. \n\nSo, the difference between SP and CP here is 25.75 - 25 = 0.75. Since SP is higher than CP, that's a profit. \n\nWait, but 0.75 is the profit amount. To find the percentage, we do (Profit / CP) * 100. \n\nSo 0.75 / 25 * 100. Let's compute that. 0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. Multiply by 100 gives 3%. \n\nSo that's a 3% profit. Wait, looking at the options, option B is 3% Profit. \n\nBut wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. \n\nOriginal SP is 27.50 with 10% profit. So CP is 27.50 / 1.1. \n\n27.50 divided by 1.1: 1.1 \u00d7 25 = 27.5, so yes, CP is 25. \n\nThen new SP is 25.75. So 25.75 -25 = 0.75 profit. 0.75 /25 = 0.03, so 3% profit. So answer B. \n\nWait but the options have B as 3% Profit. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. The options given are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss. \n\nYes, so the correct answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't miscalculate. Let me do the division again. \n\n25.75 - 25 is indeed 0.75. \n\n0.75 divided by 25: 25 \u00d7 0.03 is 0.75. So yes, 3%. \n\nTherefore the answer is B. \n",

So CP is 25. \n\nNow the second part: if the book is sold for 25.75, what's the profit or loss percentage? So the new selling price is 25.75, which is compared to the cost price of 25. \n\nHmm, since 25.75 is more than 25, that's a profit. Wait, but let me check. The selling price is 25.75 and the cost is 25. So the profit amount is 25.75 -25 = 0.75. \n\nTo find the percentage profit, it's (Profit / CP) \u00d7 100. So 0.75 /25 = 0.03, which is 3%. So that would be a 3% profit. Looking at the options, option B is 3% Profit. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait 25.75 is more than 25, yes. So profit. Profit is 0.75. \n\n0.75 divided by 25 is 0.03. So 3%. So the answer should be B. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)2% Profit, B)3% Profit, C)2% Loss, D)3% Loss, E)4% Loss. So B is there. \n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Did I miss anything? Maybe I should check if the question is asking for something else. The question says, \"then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\" Wait, maybe I misread. Wait, the original problem says: \"If it were sold for Rs. 25.75, then would have been percentage of profit and loss?\" So when sold at 25.75, what is the profit or loss percentage. \n\nYes, so the calculation is correct. 25.75 -25 = 0.75 profit. 0.75/25 = 3%, so B is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a trick here? Like, maybe the question is in a different way. Let me think again. \n\nWait, another way: perhaps I miscalculated the cost price. Let me recalculate. \n\n27.50 is 110% of CP. So 10% is 2.5, so 10% of CP is 2.5, so CP would be 25? Wait, yes, because 10% of 25 is 2.5, so 25 +2.5 is 27.5. So that's correct. \n\nThen the second SP is 25.75. So profit is 0.75. So 0.75 over 25 is 3%. So yes, 3% profit. So answer B. \n\nHmm, the options don't have any other 3% except B. So I think that's right. The answer must be B.\n",
