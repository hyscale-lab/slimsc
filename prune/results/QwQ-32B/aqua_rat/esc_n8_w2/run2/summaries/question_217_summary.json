      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about probability. So, there are 5 horses in a race, and Mr. Jain picks two at random. We need to find the probability that he selected the winning horse. Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the question properly. The key here is that he's choosing two horses, and we want the probability that at least one of them is the winning horse. Wait, actually, the problem says \"the probability that he selected the winning horse.\" Since there's only one winning horse, right? So he needs to have picked that one. So, the question is, when he picks two horses out of five, what's the chance that the winning horse is among those two.\n\nSo, to approach this, maybe I can think of the total number of possible pairs he could choose, and then how many of those pairs include the winning horse.\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 2 horses out of 5 is combination 5 choose 2. The formula for combinations is n choose k is n!/(k!(n-k)!)). So 5C2 is 5*4/(2*1) = 10. So total possible pairs are 10.\n\nNow, how many of these pairs include the winning horse? Let's call the winning horse Horse A. Then, how many pairs have Horse A and one other horse. Since he picks two, the other horse can be any of the remaining 4. Wait, no. Wait, if there are 5 horses total, and one is the winner, then there are 4 others. So the number of pairs that include the winner would be the number of ways to pair the winner with any of the other 4. So that's 4 pairs. For example, if the horses are A, B, C, D, E, then the pairs with A are AB, AC, AD, AE. That's 4 pairs. So the favorable outcomes are 4, total is 10. So probability would be 4/10, which simplifies to 2/5. Wait, but hold on, let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. The probability that the first horse he picks is the winner is 1/5. Then, the probability that the second horse is the winner, given the first wasn't, is (4/5)*(1/4) = 1/5. So adding those two probabilities gives 1/5 +1/5= 2/5. Which matches the first method. So that would be option B, 2/5. So the answer is B?\n\nWait another way: the probability that he didn't pick the winning horse is the probability that both chosen horses are among the 4 non-winners. The number of ways to choose 2 from the 4 non-winners is 4C2 =6. So the probability of not picking the winner is 6/10 = 3/5. Therefore, the probability of having picked the winner is 1 - 3/5 = 2/5. Yep, same result. So that's consistent.\n\nHmm, so all methods point to 2/5. The options given include B as 2/5, so that's the answer. Wait, but let me check once again to be sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the selection as two horses. The chance that the first is the winner is 1/5. The second pick, if the first wasn't, then the chance is (1/5) + (4/5)*(1/4). Wait, no, that's the same as before. The total probability is indeed 2/5. Okay, I think that's solid. So the answer should be B.\n",
