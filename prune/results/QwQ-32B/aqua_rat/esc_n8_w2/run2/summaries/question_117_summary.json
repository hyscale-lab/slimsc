      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so it's about partnership and profit sharing based on their investments and the time they were involved. Alright, let me read the question again carefully.\n\nA starts with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000. The total profit is Rs.375,000, and C's share is Rs.150,000. We need to find out after how many months after B joined did C come in. The options are given, so maybe I can use them to check.\n\nFirst, I remember that in such partnership problems, the profit share is proportional to the product of the investment amount and the time each partner was involved. The formula is usually (Capital \u00d7 Time) for each partner, and then the ratio of these products determines their share of the profit.\n\nLet me note down the given data:\n\n- A's investment: 40,000 for the entire year (since he started at the beginning). So that's 12 months.\n- B joins after 2 months, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait, no, actually, if the total period is a year (12 months), then B started 2 months after A, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait, no, actually, when A starts, then after 2 months B joins. So B's time is from month 3 to 12, which is 10 months. Yes, correct.\n- C joined after some more time. Let's denote the time after B joined as 'x' months. Wait, the question says \"after some more time\" after B joined. Wait, the problem says: \"C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000.\" So the \"some more time\" is after B's joining time. So the total time between A starting and C joining is 2 + x months, where x is the time after B joined. Alternatively, perhaps I need to think in terms of how much time each was in the business.\n\nWait, let's clarify the timeline:\n\n- A starts at time 0 (month 0).\n- B joins after 2 months, so at month 2.\n- C joins after some more time, say 't' months after B joined. Wait, but the question asks: \"How many months after B joined the business did C join?\" So the answer is this 't' variable. Let me define it properly.\n\nLet me denote the time when C joined as 't' months after B joined. So C joined t months after B. Since B joined at month 2, then C joined at month 2 + t. The total time for C would be (12 - (2 + t)) months? Wait, no. Because the total duration is 12 months. So if C joined at month (2 + t), then the time C was in the business is 12 - (2 + t) = (10 - t) months? Wait, that can't be right if t is more than 10. Wait, perhaps better to approach with variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me let the time that C joined after A started be 'm' months. Then, since B joined after 2 months, the time between B joining and C joining is (m - 2) months. Because C joined m months after A, so the time between B (who joined at 2) and C is m -2. So the question is asking for (m -2) months. So that's the variable we need to find. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's use variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time after which C joined after B as 'x' months. So, B joined after 2 months (so his time is 10 months), and C joined x months after B, meaning C started at (2 + x) months from the beginning, so C's time in the business would be (12 - (2 +x )) = (10 -x) months. Wait, but that can't be correct because if x is the time after B joined, then C's time is (12 - (2 +x )) months. Wait, yes. For example, if C joined 2 months after B (so x=2), then C started at month 4, so he was there for 8 months. So the time would be 12 -4 =8. That works. So C's time is (12 - (2 +x )) = 10 -x months. Wait, but if x is the number of months after B joined, then yes.\n\nSo the variables:\n\nA's time: 12 months, investment 40k.\n\nB's time: 10 months (since he started 2 months later), investment 60k.\n\nC's time: (12 - (2 +x )) = (10 -x) months, but wait, actually, the time C was in is 12 - (2 +x) = 10 - x? Wait, but x is the time after B joined. So if B joined at month 2, then C joined at 2 + x months. The total time until the end is 12 months, so C's time is 12 - (2 +x) = 10 -x. Hmm, but that would mean that if x is 8, then C would have been there for 2 months. But the problem states that the total profit is given, and C's share is 150,000. Let's see.\n\nThe profit shares are in the ratio of (A's investment * time) : (B's investment * time) : (C's investment * time).\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So C's share is (C's ratio) divided by total ratio multiplied by 375,000 equals 150,000. So we can set up an equation here.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me define the time variables again more clearly.\n\nLet\u2019s let the time when C joined be T months after A started. Since B joined after 2 months, then the time between B and C is (T - 2) months. The question is asking for (T - 2), so that's our x.\n\nSo C's time in the business is (12 - T) months.\n\nSo A's time: 12 months, B's: 12 -2 =10 months, C's: 12 - T months.\n\nWait, that's another way. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, let me set T as the number of months after A started that C joined. So C's time is 12 - T months.\n\nThen B joined at 2 months, so B's time is 10 months.\n\nC's time is (12 - T) months. The time between B and C joining is (T -2) months. Since the question asks how many months after B joined did C join, that would be (T - 2). So we need to find (T -2).\n\nSo let me proceed with variables:\n\nA: 40000 *12\n\nB:60000 *10\n\nC:120000*(12-T)\n\nThe total ratio would be the sum of these three terms.\n\nC's share is [120000*(12-T)] / [Total ratio] * 375000 =150000.\n\nSo let me set up the equation.\n\nLet me compute the ratio terms first.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = 40000 *12 = 480000\n\nB =60000 *10=600000\n\nC =120000*(12-T) = 120000*(12-T)\n\nTotal ratio = A + B + C = 480000 + 600000 + 120000*(12 - T)\n\nC's share over total profit is [120000*(12-T)] / [480000 +600000 +120000*(12-T)] = (150000)/375000 = 0.4\n\nBecause 150000 is 40% of 375000. Because 375000 *0.4 is 150000. So the ratio for C is 0.4.\n\nSo set up the equation:\n\n[120000*(12 - T)] / [480000 +600000 +120000*(12 - T)] = 0.4\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, let me compute the denominator:\n\n480,000 +600,000 = 1,080,000. So denominator is 1,080,000 + 120,000*(12-T).\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\n120000*(12-T) / [1080000 + 120000*(12-T)] = 0.4\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote X = 120000*(12-T). Then the equation becomes:\n\nX / (1080000 + X ) = 0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nX = 0.4*(1080000 + X)\n\nX = 0.4*1080000 + 0.4X\n\nX -0.4X = 432000\n\n0.6X =432000\n\nX =432000 /0.6 = 720000.\n\nSo X =720000. But X is 120000*(12-T) =720000.\n\nSo 120000*(12-T) =720000 \u2192 divide both sides by 120000:\n\n12-T =720000/120000 =6 \u2192 12-T =6 \u2192 T =12 -6 =6.\n\nSo T is 6 months. That means C joined 6 months after A started. Since A started at 0, so C joined at month 6. B joined at month 2, so the time between B and C is 6-2 =4 months. So the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n\nWait let me verify again.\n\nWait T is the time after A started when C joined. So T=6, so C joined at month 6. B joined at month 2. So the time between B and C is 6-2 =4 months. So the answer is 4 months, option B.\n\nLet me check the calculation again.\n\nLet me compute each term with T=6.\n\nA's investment-time: 40000*12 =480,000.\n\nB's:60000*(10) =600,000 (since he was there for 10 months).\n\nC's: 120,000*(12-6)= 120000*6=720,000.\n\nTotal ratio: 480k +600k +720k = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share is 720k /1,800k = 0.4, so 40% of 375,000 is 150,000. That's exactly what the problem states. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore the answer is 4 months after B joined. So option B.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 4 months. So the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in variables.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me try plugging in the options.\n\nSuppose the answer is B)4 months. So C joined 4 months after B. Since B joined after 2 months, so total months after A started is 2+4=6. So C's time is 12-6=6 months. So his investment-time is 120k *6 =720k. Then the total ratio is 40k*12=480k, B:60k*10=600k. Total 480+600+720= 1,800k. C's share is 720/1800 = 0.4, so 0.4*375,000 is indeed 150k. So that's correct.\n\nAnother option, like if the answer were A)2 months. Then C joined 2 months after B, so 2+2=4 months after A. C's time would be 8 months. His product is 120k*8=960k. Then total ratio would be 480+600+960= 2040k. C's share would be 960/2040 *375,000. Let me compute that. 960/2040 = 16/34.333... Hmm, 960 divided by 2040 simplifies to 8/17 (since 960/240=4, 2040/240=8.5? Wait, maybe better to compute 960/(2040) = 0.470588... So 0.470588 * 375,000 \u2248 176,470. That's more than 150k, so not correct. So A can't be the answer.\n\nOption D)24 months. That's impossible because the total time is 12 months. So C can't join 24 months after B. So D is invalid.\n\nOption C)23 months? Also way too long. So the only plausible is B)4 months. So I think the correct answer is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business C joined, based on their profit shares.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so it's about partnership and profit sharing based on their investments and the time they were involved. Alright, let me read the question again carefully.\n\nA starts with Rs.40,000. Then after 2 months, B joins with Rs.60,000. Then C joins after some more time with Rs.120,000.

Wait, no, actually, if the total period is a year (12 months), then B started 2 months after A, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait, no, actually, when A starts, then after 2 months B joins. So B's time is from month 3 to 12, which is 10 months. Yes, correct.\n- C joined after some more time. Let's denote the time after B joined as 'x' months. Wait, the question says \"after some more time\" after B joined. Wait, the problem says: \"C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000.\" So the \"some more time\" is after B's joining time. So the total time between A starting and C joining is 2 + x months, where x is the time after B joined. Alternatively, perhaps I need to think in terms of how much time each was in the business.\n\nWait, let's clarify the timeline:\n\n- A starts at time 0 (month 0).\n- B joins after 2 months, so at month 2.\n- C joins after some more time, say 't' months after B joined.

Wait, perhaps better to approach with variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me let the time that C joined after A started be 'm' months. Then, since B joined after 2 months, the time between B joining and C joining is (m - 2) months. Because C joined m months after A, so the time between B (who joined at 2) and C is m -2. So the question is asking for (m -2) months. So that's the variable we need to find. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's use variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the time after which C joined after B as 'x' months. So, B joined after 2 months (so his time is 10 months), and C joined x months after B, meaning C started at (2 + x) months from the beginning, so C's time in the business would be (12 - (2 +x )) = (10 -x) months. Wait, but that can't be correct because if x is the time after B joined, then C's time is (12 - (2 +x )) months. Wait, yes. For example, if C joined 2 months after B (so x=2), then C started at month 4, so he was there for 8 months. So the time would be 12 -4 =8. That works. So C's time is (12 - (2 +x )) = 10 -x months. Wait, but if x is the number of months after B joined, then yes.\n\nSo the variables:\n\nA's time: 12 months, investment 40k.\n\nB's time: 10 months (since he started 2 months later), investment 60k.\n\nC's time: (12 - (2 +x )) = (10 -x) months, but wait, actually, the time C was in is 12 - (2 +x) = 10 - x? Wait, but x is the time after B joined. So if B joined at month 2, then C joined at 2 + x months. The total time until the end is 12 months, so C's time is 12 - (2 +x) = 10 -x. Hmm, but that would mean that if x is 8, then C would have been there for 2 months. But the problem states that the total profit is given, and C's share is 150,000. Let's see.\n\nThe profit shares are in the ratio of (A's investment * time) : (B's investment * time) : (C's investment * time).\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. So C's share is (C's ratio) divided by total ratio multiplied by 375,000 equals 150,000. So we can set up an equation here.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me define the time variables again more clearly.\n\nLet\u2019s let the time when C joined be T months after A started. Since B joined after 2 months, then the time between B and C is (T - 2) months. The question is asking for (T - 2), so that's our x.\n\nSo C's time in the business is (12 - T) months.\n\nSo A's time: 12 months, B's: 12 -2 =10 months, C's: 12 - T months.\n\nWait, that's another way. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, let me set T as the number of months after A started that C joined.

Since the question asks how many months after B joined did C join, that would be (T - 2). So we need to find (T -2).\n\nSo let me proceed with variables:\n\nA: 40000 *12\n\nB:60000 *10\n\nC:120000*(12-T)\n\nThe total ratio would be the sum of these three terms.\n\nC's share is [120000*(12-T)] / [Total ratio] * 375000 =150000.\n\nSo let me set up the equation.\n\nLet me compute the ratio terms first.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = 40000 *12 = 480000\n\nB =60000 *10=600000\n\nC =120000*(12-T) = 120000*(12-T)\n\nTotal ratio = A + B + C = 480000 + 600000 + 120000*(12 - T)\n\nC's share over total profit is [120000*(12-T)] / [480000 +600000 +120000*(12-T)] = (150000)/375000 = 0.4\n\nBecause 150000 is 40% of 375000. Because 375000 *0.4 is 150000. So the ratio for C is 0.4.\n\nSo set up the equation:\n\n[120000*(12 - T)] / [480000 +600000 +120000*(12 - T)] = 0.4\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator.\n\nFirst, let me compute the denominator:\n\n480,000 +600,000 = 1,080,000. So denominator is 1,080,000 + 120,000*(12-T).\n\nLet me write the equation again:\n\n120000*(12-T) / [1080000 + 120000*(12-T)] = 0.4\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote X = 120000*(12-T). Then the equation becomes:\n\nX / (1080000 + X ) = 0.4\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nX = 0.4*(1080000 + X)\n\nX = 0.4*1080000 + 0.4X\n\nX -0.4X = 432000\n\n0.6X =432000\n\nX =432000 /0.6 = 720000.\n\nSo X =720000. But X is 120000*(12-T) =720000.\n\nSo 120000*(12-T) =720000 \u2192 divide both sides by 120000:\n\n12-T =720000/120000 =6 \u2192 12-T =6 \u2192 T =12 -6 =6.\n\nSo T is 6 months. That means C joined 6 months after A started. Since A started at 0, so C joined at month 6. B joined at month 2, so the time between B and C is 6-2 =4 months. So the answer is 4 months, which is option B.\n\nWait let me verify again.\n\nWait T is the time after A started when C joined. So T=6, so C joined at month 6. B joined at month 2. So the time between B and C is 6-2 =4 months. So the answer is 4 months, option B.\n\nLet me check the calculation again.\n\nLet me compute each term with T=6.\n\nA's investment-time: 40000*12 =480,000.\n\nB's:60000*(10) =600,000 (since he was there for 10 months).\n\nC's: 120,000*(12-6)= 120000*6=720,000.\n\nTotal ratio: 480k +600k +720k = 1,800,000.\n\nC's share is 720k /1,800k = 0.4, so 40% of 375,000 is 150,000. That's exactly what the problem states. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore the answer is 4 months after B joined. So option B.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 4 months. So the correct answer is B.\n\nWait, but let me check if I made any mistake in variables.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me try plugging in the options.\n\nSuppose the answer is B)4 months. So C joined 4 months after B. Since B joined after 2 months, so total months after A started is 2+4=6. So C's time is 12-6=6 months. So his investment-time is 120k *6 =720k. Then the total ratio is 40k*12=480k, B:60k*10=600k. Total 480+600+720= 1,800k. C's share is 720/1800 = 0.4, so 0.4*375,000 is indeed 150k. So that's correct.\n\nAnother option, like if the answer were A)2 months. Then C joined 2 months after B, so 2+2=4 months after A. C's time would be 8 months. His product is 120k*8=960k. Then total ratio would be 480+600+960= 2040k. C's share would be 960/2040 *375,000. Let me compute that. 960/2040 = 16/34.333... Hmm, 960 divided by 2040 simplifies to 8/17 (since 960/240=4, 2040/240=8.5? Wait, maybe better to compute 960/(2040) = 0.470588... So 0.470588 * 375,000 \u2248 176,470. That's more than 150k, so not correct. So A can't be the answer.\n\nOption D)24 months. That's impossible because the total time is 12 months. So C can't join 24 months after B. So D is invalid.\n\nOption C)23 months? Also way too long. So the only plausible is B)4 months. So I think the correct answer is B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how many months after B joined the business C joined, based on their profit shares. The profit share is proportional to the product of their investments and the time they were involved.\n\n**Given Data:**\n- A's investment: \u20b940,000 for 12 months.\n- B joined after 2 months, so B's time is 10 months (investment: \u20b960,000).\n- C joined after an additional \\( x \\) months (after B), so C's time in the business is \\( 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x \\) months (investment: \u20b9120,000).\n- Total profit: \u20b9375,000. C's share: \u20b9150,000 (40% of total profit).\n\n**Calculations:**\n1. **Profit Ratios:**\n   - A's ratio: \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\)\n   - B's ratio: \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\)\n   - C's ratio: \\( 120,000 \\times (10 - x) \\)\n\n2. **Total Ratio:**\n   \\[\n   480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000x = 2,280,000 - 120,000x\n   \\]\n   (Wait, correction: The correct total ratio is \\( 480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (10 - x) = 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 - 120,000x \\). However, simplifying this step-by-step is error-prone. Let's re-express with variables properly.)\n\nLet \\( T \\) be the time after A started when C joined. Then:\n- C's time: \\( 12 - T \\) months.\n- The time between B and C joining is \\( T - 2 \\) months (the answer we need).\n- C's ratio: \\( 120,000 \\times (12 - T) \\).\n\n**Equation Setup:**\nC's share must be 40% of the total profit:\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000 \\times (12 - T)}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000 \\times (12 - T)} = 0.4\n\\]\nLet \\( X = 120,000 \\times (12 - T) \\):\n\\[\n\\frac{X}{1,080,000 + X} = 0.4 \\implies X = 0.4(1,080,000 + X)\n\\]\nSolving for \\( X \\):\n\\[\nX = 432,000 + 0.4X \\implies 0.6X = 432,000 \\implies X = 720,000\n\\]\nSubstitute back:\n\\[\n120,000 \\times (12 - T) = 720,000 \\implies 12 - T = 6 \\implies T = 6\n\\]\nThus, C joined 6 months after A started. Since B joined at 2 months, the time between B and C is \\( 6 - 2 = 4 \\) months.\n\n**Verification:**\n- C's ratio: \\( 120,000 \\times 6 = 720,000 \\)\n- Total ratio: \\( 480,000 + 600,000 + 720,000 = 1,800,000 \\)\n- C's share: \\( \\frac{720,000}{1,800,000} \\times 375,000 = 150,000 \\), which matches the given data.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **4 months**, corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem about partners in a business and their profit shares. Let me read it again carefully. \n\nA starts with Rs.40,000. Then B joins after 2 months with Rs.60,000. C joins later with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, the total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. The question is asking how many months after B joined did C join? The options are given as A to E. \n\nHmm, right. The key here is to calculate the ratio of their investments considering the time each was in the business. Because profit sharing in partnerships is usually based on the product of capital invested and the time period. \n\nLet me think. Let's denote the time each person was in the business. \n\nA was there for the entire year, which is 12 months. \n\nB joined after 2 months, so B's time is 12 - 2 = 10 months? Wait, no. Wait, if the total time is a year (12 months), then A started at month 0, B started at month 2, so B's time is 10 months. \n\nC joined after some more time after B. Let me see. Let's say that C joined 'x' months after B. Wait, the question says \"how many months after B joined the business did C join?\" So the time between B's entry and C's entry is the value we need to find. \n\nAlternatively, maybe better to denote variables for C's time. Let me try to structure this.\n\nLet me denote the time that C joined after A started as (2 + t) months. Because B joined after 2 months, so C joined t months after B. So C's time would be 12 - (2 + t) = 10 - t months? Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. \n\nAlternatively, let me set variables more clearly. Let me see:\n\nLet the time after which C joined after B is 'm' months. So, since B joined after 2 months, then C joined 2 + m months after A started. Therefore, the time that C was in the business is (12 - (2 + m)) months? Wait, the total time is 12 months. So if C joined after (2 + m) months from the start, then his time in the business is 12 - (2 + m) = 10 - m months. Wait, but that can't be right. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to think in terms of each person's time:\n\nA's time: 12 months.\n\nB's time: 12 - 2 = 10 months (since he joined after 2 months).\n\nC's time: Let\u2019s say that C joined 'x' months after A started. So C's time is (12 - x) months. But the question is how many months after B joined did C join? Since B joined at 2 months, the time between B and C would be (x - 2) months. Wait, maybe that's the right way. \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nSuppose A starts at time 0. B joins at 2 months. C joins at some time after that. Let's denote the time when C joined as (2 + m) months after A started. Here, m is the number of months after B's joining that C joined. So the time between B and C is m months. \n\nTherefore, C's total time in the business would be (12 - (2 + m)) = 10 - m months. Wait, but if the total time is 12 months, then yes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time that each person was in the business is as follows:\n\nA: 12 months\n\nB: 10 months (since he started 2 months later)\n\nC: Let's say he started t months after A. So his time is (12 - t) months. But the question asks for how many months after B joined did C join? The time between B and C would be (t - 2) months. Because B started at 2 months. So if C started at t months after A, then the time between B and C is t - 2. \n\nWait, perhaps I should use variables for the time each was in the business, then set up ratios. Let's try that approach. \n\nThe profit share is proportional to (Capital \u00d7 Time). \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s see:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that C joined 'x' months after B. So, since B joined after 2 months, C joined at 2 + x months after A started. So the time C was in the business is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. \n\nWait, but the time can't be negative, so x must be less than 10. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time that C invested is (12 - (2 + x)) months, where x is the months after B's entry. Hmm, maybe that's okay. \n\nSo, the capital times time for each partner:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\n\nB: 60,000 * 10 (since B was there for 10 months)\n\nC: 120,000 * (10 - x) [since his time is 10 -x months? Wait, no, because if C joined after (2 + x) months from the start, then the time he contributed is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 -x months. \n\nSo, the ratio of their investments is A:B:C = (40000*12) : (60000*10) : (120000*(10 - x))\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. \n\nSo the ratio of C's share to total profit is 150000 / 375000 = 0.4, which is 2/5. So C's share is 2/5 of the total. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of C's investment-time to the total investment-time should be 2/5. \n\nLet me compute the ratios. Let me first compute each term. \n\nLet me compute the terms:\n\nA: 40000 *12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60000 *10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120000x \n\nTotal = 480,000 + 600,000 + [1,200,000 - 120000x] \n\nTotal = (480k + 600k) = 1,080,000 plus 1,200,000 gives 2,280,000 minus 120,000x. \n\nWait, but that's the total capital-time. \n\nWait, the ratio of C's share is (C's capital-time) divided by total capital-time equals C's profit share. \n\nSo, according to the problem, C's share is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, so:\n\n[120,000*(10 - x)] / [40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(10 -x)] = 0.4\n\nLet me write that equation out.\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator step by step. \n\nFirst, numerator: 120000*(10 -x) \n\nDenominator: 40000*12 is 480,000; 60000*10 is 600,000; so adding those gives 1,080,000. Then adding 120000*(10 -x) gives 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -x). \n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[120,000*(10 - x)] / [1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -x)] = 0.4 \n\nLet me simplify this equation. \n\nLet me denote (10 -x) as a variable to make it easier. Let me call that term Y. \n\nSo Y = 10 -x. \n\nThen numerator is 120,000Y. Denominator is 1,080,000 + 120,000Y. \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n120,000Y / (1,080,000 + 120,000Y) = 0.4 \n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000Y = 0.4*(1,080,000 + 120,000Y)\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n0.4 *1,080,000 = 432,000 \n\n0.4 *120,000Y = 48,000Y \n\nSo equation is:\n\n120,000Y = 432,000 +48,000Y \n\nSubtract 48,000Y from both sides:\n\n72,000Y = 432,000 \n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\nY = 432,000 /72,000 \n\nY = 6 \n\nBut Y was 10 -x, so:\n\n10 - x =6 \n\nTherefore, x =10 -6 =4 \n\nSo x is 4 months. \n\nWait, so x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So the answer is 4 months, which is option B. \n\nWait, let me check this again. Let me verify the calculation. \n\nSo if x=4, then C joined 4 months after B. Since B joined after 2 months, so C joined 2+4=6 months after A started. \n\nTherefore, C's time in the business is 12-6=6 months. \n\nLet me compute their ratios:\n\nA: 40,000 *12= 480,000\n\nB:60,000 *10= 600,000\n\nC:120,000 *6= 720,000\n\nTotal = 480+600+720 = 1,800,000 \n\nWait, but wait, in my previous calculation when Y=6, which is 10 -x =6, so x=4. Then C's time is 6 months. \n\nC's capital-time is 120k*6 =720,000. \n\nTotal is 480k +600k +720k = 1,800,000. \n\nC's share is 720,000 /1,800,000 = 0.4, which is 40%, which matches the given 150,000 out of 375,000. Because 375,000 *0.4 is 150,000. So that's correct. \n\nSo the answer is 4 months after B joined, so option B. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made any miscalculations. Let me see:\n\nThe equation steps again:\n\nStarting with:\n\n[120000*(10 -x)] / [480000 +600000 +120000*(10 -x)] = 0.4 \n\nWait, the denominator is 480k (A) +600k (B) + C's part. \n\nWait, in my calculation above, I considered the denominator as 480k +600k + 120,000*(10 -x). But 480k+600k is 1,080,000. So adding 120,000*(10 -x) gives 1,080,000 +1,200,000 -120,000x? Wait, no, 120,000*(10 -x) is 1,200,000 -120,000x. Wait, but adding that to 1,080,000 gives 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x = 2,280,000 -120,000x. \n\nWait a second, but in my earlier steps, when I set Y =10 -x, then the denominator becomes 1,080,000 +120,000Y. Which would be 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -x). Which is exactly the same as above. \n\nBut when I plugged in x=4, then 10-x is 6. So 120,000 *6 =720,000. So the denominator would be 480k +600k +720k = 1,800,000. Which is correct. \n\nWait, but in the equation when I set up the denominator as 1,080,000 +120,000*(10 -x), that's correct. \n\nSo the calculation steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 4 months after B joined, so the correct option is B. \n\nWait, but looking at the options again: the options are A)2, B)4, C)23, D)24, E)84. So B is 4, which matches. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. I think that's the right answer. Let me just check if there's another possible way someone might get confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might miscalculate the time. Suppose someone thought that C's time was (12 -x) where x is the time after A started. Wait, but that would be a different variable. But in my setup, the variable x was the months after B's joining. So as long as the variables are defined correctly, it's okay. \n\nAnother way to approach is to set C's joining time as t months after the start. Then the time C is in the business is (12 - t). The time between B and C's joining would be (t -2). So the question asks for (t-2). \n\nSo let me try that approach again. \n\nLet\u2019s say C joined t months after A started. So C's time is (12 - t). \n\nThe time after B joined that C joined is (t -2). \n\nThe profit ratio for C would be [120000*(12 -t)] divided by the total. \n\nTotal profit is 375,000, so C's share is 150,000. \n\nSo, setting up the equation:\n\nC's share / Total = [120000*(12 -t)] / [40000*12 + 60000*(12 -2) + 120000*(12 -t)] \n\nWait, because B was in for (12-2)=10 months, and C is (12 -t). \n\nWait, so the equation would be:\n\n150000 /375000 = [120000*(12 - t)] / [40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(12 - t)]\n\nSimplify left side to 0.4. \n\nSo:\n\n0.4 = [120,000*(12 -t)] / [480,000 +600,000 + 120,000*(12 -t)]\n\nDenominator is 480k +600k = 1,080,000 plus 120k*(12 -t) \n\nSo denominator = 1,080,000 +1,440,000 -120,000t = 2,520,000 -120,000t \n\nWait, but numerator is 120,000*(12 -t) = 1,440,000 -120,000t \n\nSo equation is:\n\n0.4 = (1,440,000 -120,000t) / (2,520,000 -120,000t )\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n0.4*(2,520,000 -120,000t) = 1,440,000 -120,000t \n\nCalculate left side:\n\n0.4*2,520,000 = 1,008,000 \n\n0.4*(-120,000t) = -48,000t \n\nSo left side: 1,008,000 -48,000t \n\nEquation:\n\n1,008,000 -48,000t = 1,440,000 -120,000t \n\nBring variables to one side and constants to the other:\n\n-48,000t +120,000t = 1,440,000 -1,008,000 \n\n72,000t = 432,000 \n\nt = 432,000 /72,000 = 6 \n\nSo t is 6 months after A started. \n\nTherefore, C joined 6 months after A. So the time after B joined (who joined at 2 months) is 6 -2 =4 months. \n\nSame result. So the answer is B)4. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. \n\nI think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes here. So I'll go with B.\n",

Let me see:\n\nLet the time after which C joined after B is 'm' months. So, since B joined after 2 months, then C joined 2 + m months after A started. Therefore, the time that C was in the business is (12 - (2 + m)) months? Wait, the total time is 12 months. So if C joined after (2 + m) months from the start, then his time in the business is 12 - (2 + m) = 10 - m months. Wait, but that can't be right. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to think in terms of each person's time:\n\nA's time: 12 months.\n\nB's time: 12 - 2 = 10 months (since he joined after 2 months).\n\nC's time: Let\u2019s say that C joined 'x' months after A started. So C's time is (12 - x) months. But the question is how many months after B joined did C join? Since B joined at 2 months, the time between B and C would be (x - 2) months. Wait, maybe that's the right way. \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nSuppose A starts at time 0. B joins at 2 months. C joins at some time after that. Let's denote the time when C joined as (2 + m) months after A started. Here, m is the number of months after B's joining that C joined. So the time between B and C is m months. \n\nTherefore, C's total time in the business would be (12 - (2 + m)) = 10 - m months. Wait, but if the total time is 12 months, then yes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time that each person was in the business is as follows:\n\nA: 12 months\n\nB: 10 months (since he started 2 months later)\n\nC: Let's say he started t months after A. So his time is (12 - t) months. But the question asks for how many months after B joined did C join? The time between B and C would be (t - 2) months. Because B started at 2 months. So if C started at t months after A, then the time between B and C is t - 2. \n\nWait, perhaps I should use variables for the time each was in the business, then set up ratios. Let's try that approach. \n\nThe profit share is proportional to (Capital \u00d7 Time). \n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s let\u2019s see:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that C joined 'x' months after B. So, since B joined after 2 months, C joined at 2 + x months after A started. So the time C was in the business is (12 - (2 + x)) = 10 - x months. \n\nWait, but the time can't be negative, so x must be less than 10. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the time that C invested is (12 - (2 + x)) months, where x is the months after B's entry. Hmm, maybe that's okay. \n\nSo, the capital times time for each partner:\n\nA: 40,000 * 12\n\nB: 60,000 * 10 (since B was there for 10 months)\n\nC: 120,000 * (10 - x) [since his time is 10 -x months? Wait, no, because if C joined after (2 + x) months from the start, then the time he contributed is 12 - (2 + x) = 10 -x months. \n\nSo, the ratio of their investments is A:B:C = (40000*12) : (60000*10) : (120000*(10 - x))\n\nThe total profit is 375,000, and C's share is 150,000. \n\nSo the ratio of C's share to total profit is 150000 / 375000 = 0.4, which is 2/5. So C's share is 2/5 of the total. \n\nTherefore, the ratio of C's investment-time to the total investment-time should be 2/5. \n\nLet me compute the ratios. Let me first compute each term. \n\nLet me compute the terms:\n\nA: 40000 *12 = 480,000\n\nB: 60000 *10 = 600,000\n\nC: 120000*(10 -x) = 1,200,000 - 120000x \n\nTotal = 480,000 + 600,000 + [1,200,000 - 120000x] \n\nTotal = (480k + 600k) = 1,080,000 plus 1,200,000 gives 2,280,000 minus 120,000x. \n\nWait, but that's the total capital-time. \n\nWait, the ratio of C's share is (C's capital-time) divided by total capital-time equals C's profit share. \n\nSo, according to the problem, C's share is 150,000 / 375,000 = 0.4, so:\n\n[120,000*(10 - x)] / [40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(10 -x)] = 0.4\n\nLet me write that equation out.\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator step by step. \n\nFirst, numerator: 120000*(10 -x) \n\nDenominator: 40000*12 is 480,000; 60000*10 is 600,000; so adding those gives 1,080,000. Then adding 120000*(10 -x) gives 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -x). \n\nSo the equation is:\n\n[120,000*(10 - x)] / [1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -x)] = 0.4 \n\nLet me simplify this equation. \n\nLet me denote (10 -x) as a variable to make it easier. Let me call that term Y. \n\nSo Y = 10 -x. \n\nThen numerator is 120,000Y. Denominator is 1,080,000 + 120,000Y. \n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n120,000Y / (1,080,000 + 120,000Y) = 0.4 \n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n120,000Y = 0.4*(1,080,000 + 120,000Y)\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side:\n\n0.4 *1,080,000 = 432,000 \n\n0.4 *120,000Y = 48,000Y \n\nSo equation is:\n\n120,000Y = 432,000 +48,000Y \n\nSubtract 48,000Y from both sides:\n\n72,000Y = 432,000 \n\nDivide both sides by 72,000:\n\nY = 432,000 /72,000 \n\nY = 6 \n\nBut Y was 10 -x, so:\n\n10 - x =6 \n\nTherefore, x =10 -6 =4 \n\nSo x is 4 months. \n\nWait, so x is the number of months after B joined that C joined. So the answer is 4 months, which is option B. \n\nWait, let me check this again. Let me verify the calculation. \n\nSo if x=4, then C joined 4 months after B. Since B joined after 2 months, so C joined 2+4=6 months after A started. \n\nTherefore, C's time in the business is 12-6=6 months. \n\nLet me compute their ratios:\n\nA: 40,000 *12= 480,000\n\nB:60,000 *10= 600,000\n\nC:120,000 *6= 720,000\n\nTotal = 480+600+720 = 1,800,000 \n\nWait, but wait, in my previous calculation when Y=6, which is 10 -x =6, so x=4. Then C's time is 6 months. \n\nC's capital-time is 120k*6 =720,000. \n\nTotal is 480k +600k +720k = 1,800,000. \n\nC's share is 720,000 /1,800,000 = 0.4, which is 40%, which matches the given 150,000 out of 375,000. Because 375,000 *0.4 is 150,000. So that's correct. \n\nSo the answer is 4 months after B joined, so option B. \n\nWait, but let me check if I made any miscalculations. Let me see:\n\nThe equation steps again:\n\nStarting with:\n\n[120000*(10 -x)] / [480000 +600000 +120000*(10 -x)] = 0.4 \n\nWait, the denominator is 480k (A) +600k (B) + C's part. \n\nWait, in my calculation above, I considered the denominator as 480k +600k + 120,000*(10 -x). But 480k+600k is 1,080,000. So adding 120,000*(10 -x) gives 1,080,000 +1,200,000 -120,000x? Wait, no, 120,000*(10 -x) is 1,200,000 -120,000x. Wait, but adding that to 1,080,000 gives 1,080,000 + 1,200,000 -120,000x = 2,280,000 -120,000x. \n\nWait a second, but in my earlier steps, when I set Y =10 -x, then the denominator becomes 1,080,000 +120,000Y. Which would be 1,080,000 + 120,000*(10 -x). Which is exactly the same as above. \n\nBut when I plugged in x=4, then 10-x is 6. So 120,000 *6 =720,000. So the denominator would be 480k +600k +720k = 1,800,000. Which is correct. \n\nWait, but in the equation when I set up the denominator as 1,080,000 +120,000*(10 -x), that's correct. \n\nSo the calculation steps are correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 4 months after B joined, so the correct option is B. \n\nWait, but looking at the options again: the options are A)2, B)4, C)23, D)24, E)84. So B is 4, which matches. \n\nHmm, that seems correct. I think that's the right answer. Let me just check if there's another possible way someone might get confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might miscalculate the time. Suppose someone thought that C's time was (12 -x) where x is the time after A started. Wait, but that would be a different variable. But in my setup, the variable x was the months after B's joining. So as long as the variables are defined correctly, it's okay. \n\nAnother way to approach is to set C's joining time as t months after the start. Then the time C is in the business is (12 - t). The time between B and C's joining would be (t -2). So the question asks for (t-2). \n\nSo let me try that approach again. \n\nLet\u2019s say C joined t months after A started. So C's time is (12 - t). \n\nThe time after B joined that C joined is (t -2). \n\nThe profit ratio for C would be [120000*(12 -t)] divided by the total. \n\nTotal profit is 375,000, so C's share is 150,000. \n\nSo, setting up the equation:\n\nC's share / Total = [120000*(12 -t)] / [40000*12 + 60000*(12 -2) + 120000*(12 -t)] \n\nWait, because B was in for (12-2)=10 months, and C is (12 -t). \n\nWait, so the equation would be:\n\n150000 /375000 = [120000*(12 - t)] / [40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(12 - t)]\n\nSimplify left side to 0.4. \n\nSo:\n\n0.4 = [120,000*(12 -t)] / [480,000 +600,000 + 120,000*(12 -t)]\n\nDenominator is 480k +600k = 1,080,000 plus 120k*(12 -t) \n\nSo denominator = 1,080,000 +1,440,000 -120,000t = 2,520,000 -120,000t \n\nWait, but numerator is 120,000*(12 -t) = 1,440,000 -120,000t \n\nSo equation is:\n\n0.4 = (1,440,000 -120,000t) / (2,520,000 -120,000t )\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n0.4*(2,520,000 -120,000t) = 1,440,000 -120,000t \n\nCalculate left side:\n\n0.4*2,520,000 = 1,008,000 \n\n0.4*(-120,000t) = -48,000t \n\nSo left side: 1,008,000 -48,000t \n\nEquation:\n\n1,008,000 -48,000t = 1,440,000 -120,000t \n\nBring variables to one side and constants to the other:\n\n-48,000t +120,000t = 1,440,000 -1,008,000 \n\n72,000t = 432,000 \n\nt = 432,000 /72,000 = 6 \n\nSo t is 6 months after A started. \n\nTherefore, C joined 6 months after A. So the time after B joined (who joined at 2 months) is 6 -2 =4 months. \n\nSame result. So the answer is B)4. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. \n\nI think this is solid. I don't see any mistakes here. So I'll go with B.\n\n\nTo determine how many months after B joined the business C joined, we calculate the profit shares based on the product of each partner's capital and their time in the business. \n\n- **A's investment time**: 12 months (started at the beginning).\n- **B's investment time**: 10 months (joined after 2 months).\n- **C's investment time**: Let \\( x \\) be the months after B joined when C joined. Thus, C joined \\( 2 + x \\) months after A started, giving C \\( 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x \\) months in the business.\n\nThe profit ratio is proportional to \\( \\text{Capital} \\times \\text{Time} \\):\n\n- **A's contribution**: \\( 40,000 \\times 12 = 480,000 \\)\n- **B's contribution**: \\( 60,000 \\times 10 = 600,000 \\)\n- **C's contribution**: \\( 120,000 \\times (10 - x) \\)\n\nC's share of the profit is \\( \\frac{150,000}{375,000} = 0.4 \\). Setting up the equation for C's ratio:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000(10 - x)}{480,000 + 600,000 + 120,000(10 - x)} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nLet \\( Y = 10 - x \\). Substituting:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{120,000Y}{1,080,000 + 120,000Y} = 0.4\n\\]\n\nSolving:\n\n\\[\n120,000Y = 0.4(1,080,000 + 120,000Y)\n\\]\n\\[\n120,000Y = 432,000 + 48,000Y\n\\]\n\\[\n72,000Y = 432,000 \\implies Y = 6\n\\]\n\nSince \\( Y = 10 - x \\):\n\n\\[\n10 - x = 6 \\implies x = 4\n\\]\n\nThus, C joined **4 months after B**. The correct answer is **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
