      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket of 10. Hmm, right, this sounds like a combination problem because the order in which we pick the oranges doesn't matter. Like, if I pick orange A and then orange B, that's the same as picking B then A. So combinations are used when the order isn't important, right?\n\nSo the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n - k)!). In this case, n is 10 oranges and k is 2. Let me plug those numbers in. So that would be 10 factorial divided by (2 factorial times (10-2) factorial). \n\nWait, 10 factorial is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! but maybe I can simplify this. Let me write it out. The formula becomes 10!/(2! * 8!). Since 10! is 10\u00d79\u00d78!, so when I divide by 8! it cancels out. So that leaves me with (10\u00d79)/(2\u00d71). Let me calculate that. 10 times 9 is 90, divided by 2 gives 45. Oh right, so the answer should be 45. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 45. So the answer must be A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up combinations and permutations. If it were permutations, the order would matter and the answer would be 10\u00d79=90, which is option B. But the question says \"chosen\" which implies that order doesn't matter. So yeah, combinations are correct here. Therefore the correct answer is A)45.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: there are 10 oranges in a basket, and I need to find the number of ways to choose 2 oranges. The options are A)45, B)90, C)120, D)150, E)180. Hmm, right. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nAlright, the question is about combinations because the order in which we pick the oranges doesn't matter. Like, choosing orange A then B is the same as B then A. So combinations are used when the order doesn't matter, permutations when it does. Since the problem just asks for choosing 2, not arranging them in order, it's combinations.\n\nThe formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n - k)!). Here, n is 10 oranges and k is 2. So plugging in the numbers, that would be 10! divided by (2! times 8!). \n\nLet me calculate that. 10 factorial is 10 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 8! so when I divide by 8! it cancels out the 8! part. So that leaves (10 \u00d7 9)/ (2! ). Since 2! is 2, so 10 \u00d79 is 90 divided by 2 is 45. So the answer should be 45, which is option A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Sometimes I might confuse combinations with permutations. If it were permutations, then it would be 10 \u00d79 =90, which is option B. But the question says \"chosen\", so order doesn't matter. Therefore, the correct answer should be A)45. Yeah, that makes sense. The other options like 120 or 180 are way higher. 10 choose 2 is definitely 45. So the answer is A.\n",
