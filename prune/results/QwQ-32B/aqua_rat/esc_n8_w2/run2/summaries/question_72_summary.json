      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem step by step. The question is about finding the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person. The problem gives some information about bus fares and total fares paid by a certain number of people. Hmm, I should parse the problem carefully.\n\nThe first sentence says: \"The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh is four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person.\" Wait, so the bus fare for two people is equal to (4/3) times the train fare for one person. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote the train fare for one person as T. Then the bus fare for two people would be (4/3)*T. So, if I need the bus fare per person, maybe I can divide that by two? Let's see. Because if two people pay 4/3 T together, then each person's bus fare would be (4/3 T)/2 = (2/3) T. Wait, so the bus fare per person is two-thirds of the train fare? Hmm, that's an important point. Alternatively, maybe I should keep it as the total for two people first.\n\nThe problem then says: \"The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places is Rs.1512.\" So, 6 people take the bus, and 8 take the train. The total of their fares is 1512. I need to set up an equation here.\n\nFirst, let me define variables properly. Let me let T be the train fare per person. Then, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3)*T. So, for each two people on the bus, they pay 4/3 T. Therefore, the bus fare per person would be (4/3 T)/2 = (2/3 T). Wait, so each bus passenger pays (2/3) T?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think in terms of total bus fare for 6 people. Let me see.\n\nLet me try to structure this step by step.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet T be the train fare per person (this is what we need to find).\n\nThe bus fare for two people is (4/3)*T. Therefore, for each two people on the bus, the cost is 4/3 T. So, the total bus fare for 6 people would be: since 6 people is 3 groups of two, so 3*(4/3 T) = 4 T. Wait, because each two people cost 4/3 T. So 6 people divided into 3 groups of 2: 3*(4/3 T) = 4T. \n\nThen, the total bus fare for 6 people is 4T. \n\nMeanwhile, the total train fare for 8 people would be 8*T (since each person pays T).\n\nThe total of both is 4T +8T =12 T. But the problem says that the total is Rs.1512. So 12 T =1512. Then T would be 1512/12. Let me compute that. \n\n1512 divided by 12: 12*126 = 1512. Because 12*100 is 1200, 12*26 is 312, so 1200+312=1512. So T=126. \n\nWait, so that would be option A) 126? But let me check my steps again to be sure.\n\nWait, let me confirm the bus fare calculation again. The problem states that the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person. So if the train fare is T, then two people on the bus pay (4/3)*T. Therefore, for each two people, that's their total. So for 6 people, that's 3 times that amount (since 6 divided by 2 is 3). So 3*(4/3 T) = 4T. That's correct. \n\nThe train fare for 8 people is 8*T. So total is 4T +8T =12T. 12T=1512 \u2192 T=126. So the answer is A?\n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options include 126 as A, yes. But wait, I might have made a mistake in interpreting the bus fare. Let me read the question again carefully.\n\n\"The bus fare for two persons for travelling between Agra and Aligarh is four-thirds the train fare between the same places for one person.\"\n\nSo bus fare (for two) = (4/3)*(train fare for one). So that part is correct. So the bus fare for two is 4/3 T. So for 6 people, that's 3*(4/3 T) =4T. That's correct. \n\nHmm. So the calculation seems right. Then the answer is 126, which is option A. But wait, I recall sometimes there might be a trick. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is saying that the total bus fare for two people is four-thirds of the train fare for one person. So if the train fare is T per person, then the total for two by bus is (4/3) T. So the per person bus fare would be (4/3 T)/2 = (2/3 T). So each bus passenger pays 2/3 T. Then, 6 passengers would pay 6*(2/3 T) =4T. That's the same as before. So same result. \n\nYes, so the total bus fare is 4T, train is 8T, total 12T. So T=126. That seems correct. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 126, so the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The problem says \"the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train\". So yes, 6 by bus and 8 by train, so their total fares add up to 1512. \n\nHmm, all steps check out. So I think the answer is A)126. Let me check if any other option could be possible. For example, if I messed up the ratio. Let me see: if the bus fare for two is 4/3 of the train fare for one. Suppose T was 126, then the bus fare for two is (4/3)*126 = 168. So each bus person pays 84. 6 people would be 6*84 = 504. The train fare for 8 people would be 8*126=1008. 504+1008=1512. Exactly matches. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A)126.\n",
