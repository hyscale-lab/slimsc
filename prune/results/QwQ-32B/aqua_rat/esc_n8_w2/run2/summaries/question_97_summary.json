      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where a rectangular wire is bent into a square, and find the length of each side of the square. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the original shape is a rectangle with length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm. The wire is being rebent into a square. That means the total length of the wire (the perimeter) stays the same, right? Because you're just reshaping it, not adding or removing any wire.\n\nSo, the first thing I should do is calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + breadth). Let me plug in the numbers here. The length is 27 and breadth is 17. So adding those gives 27 + 17 = 44. Then multiply by 2: 2*44 = 88. Wait, so the perimeter is 88 cm?\n\nNow, when this wire is formed into a square, all four sides of the square will be equal. The perimeter of the square will be the same as the rectangle's perimeter. The formula for the perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length. Let me denote the side of the square as 's'. So 4*s = perimeter of rectangle, which is 88.\n\nTo find s, I need to divide 88 by 4. Let me do that calculation. 88 divided by 4 is... 22. Hmm, 4 times 22 is 88. So each side of the square should be 22 cm. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 22. So the answer must be C. Let me just double-check my steps to be sure. \n\nWait, original perimeter: 2*(27+17) = 2*(44)=88. Square's perimeter is 4*s =88 \u2192 s=22. Yep, that seems right. The options given are A)9, B)11, C)22, D)25, E)31. So C is the correct choice. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. Maybe I should check if I added 27 and 17 correctly. 27 plus 17: 20+10 is 30, 7+7 is 14, so total 44. That's correct. Then times 2 is 88. Divided by 4 is indeed 22. Okay, confident now.\n",

Then they rebend it into a square, and we need to find the length of each side of that square.
