      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the percentage difference in the average annual cost between buying new tires and repairing the current ones. Hmm, the problem says the new tires last four years and cost $180 each. Repairing the current tires costs $40 per tire and extends their life by one year. Wait, so the current tires, when repaired, last an extra year. But how long do the current tires originally last? The question mentions that the new tires last four years, but I'm not sure about the original lifespan of the current ones. Wait, maybe the problem is implying that the current tires, without repair, would have a certain lifespan. Wait, the problem might be that the customer can choose between buying new tires (which last four years) or repairing current ones (which would last one more year). Wait, perhaps the current tires are already in use and need repair to extend their life. But the problem's wording is a bit unclear here. Let me read again.\n\nThe question states: \"Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" \n\nOh, so the current tires, when repaired, will last one additional year. That suggests that the current tires are already in use and are near the end of their lifespan. Wait, but the problem doesn't mention the original lifespan of the current tires. Hmm, maybe the current tires, when repaired, will last for an additional year beyond their current remaining lifespan. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the customer is considering replacing the current tires (which are about to expire after four years) with new ones, or instead, repair them each year for an extra year. Wait, maybe the problem is structured so that the customer has current tires that are already three years old, so they have one more year left, but that's not stated. Alternatively, maybe the current tires, without repair, would only last another year, but repairing them extends that by another year? Wait, perhaps the problem is that the current tires can be repaired once to last one more year, so their total lifespan after repair would be, say, five years? But maybe the problem is simpler. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question is about the average cost per year of the new tires versus the cost of repairing the current tires. Let's parse the problem again step by step.\n\nThe new tires cost $180 each and last four years. So the average annual cost for new tires is $180 divided by 4 years, which is $45 per year. \n\nNow, the alternative is repairing the current tires. The repair costs $40 per tire and makes the current tires last for one additional year. Wait, so does that mean that the repair allows the current tires to last one more year than they would have otherwise? Or does the repair extend their total lifespan by one year? The wording says \"make the current tires last for one additional year\". So, if the customer chooses to repair the current tires, they pay $40 per tire now, and that repair makes the tires last an extra year. \n\nBut how many years would the current tires last without repair? The problem says \"when purchased new, last for four years.\" But the current tires might be existing ones that are already in use. Let's see. The problem is a bit ambiguous here. Wait, perhaps the current tires are already three years old, so they have one more year left, and the repair extends that to two years? Or maybe the current tires are being considered for replacement now, but if repaired, they can last another year. The problem might be that the customer has to choose between buying new tires (which will last four years) or repairing their current tires (which would then last one more year). \n\nWait, maybe the problem is structured such that the current tires, if not repaired, would have to be replaced now. So the customer can either buy new tires (cost $180 each, lasting 4 years) or repair the current ones for $40 each, which would make them last one additional year (so instead of needing to replace them now, they can last another year). But then, after that year, they would have to be replaced again? Or maybe the repair only gives one more year, so the total lifespan of the current tires after repair is one year. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the current tires, when repaired, will last for one additional year beyond their current remaining lifespan, but the problem doesn't specify how much time is left. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, maybe the question is considering that the current tires are at the end of their lifespan. For example, the customer is at a point where they need to decide whether to buy new tires (which would last four years) or repair the current ones (which would last one additional year). So the repair gives one more year's use of the current tires, but then they would have to be replaced. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customer can choose between buying new tires (which last 4 years) or repairing the current tires each year for an extra year. Wait, but the question says \"have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So each repair gives one more year. But the problem is comparing the average cost over what time period? \n\nWait, the question says: \"The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So maybe we need to compute the average annual cost for each option over the same period. \n\nLet me think again. Let's consider that if the customer chooses new tires, they pay $180 upfront, and the tires last 4 years. The average annual cost is 180/4 = $45 per year.\n\nIf the customer chooses to repair the current tires, then the cost is $40 per tire. But how long does that repair last? The repair makes the current tires last for one additional year. So perhaps the current tires would otherwise have lasted zero more years, so repairing them gives one year of use. So in that case, the repair is a one-time cost of $40 to get one more year of use. \n\nIn that case, the average cost per year for the repair option would be $40 per year (since it's $40 for one year). \n\nSo comparing the two options: new tires have an average cost of $45/year, repair has $40/year. Wait, but the question is asking how much greater the new tires' average cost is compared to the repair's. Wait, that can't be right because 45 vs 40 would be a 12.5% increase. Wait, but let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires without repair would last 1 year, and with repair, they last 2 years. But the problem states that the repair makes them last one additional year. So perhaps the original remaining lifespan is X, and repair adds one year. If the customer is choosing between new (4 years) or repair (which extends the current tires by 1 year), then perhaps the current tires are at the point where without repair, they can only last 1 more year. So if they repair, they get 2 years. \n\nWait, but the question is a bit unclear. Since the problem says \"Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years.\" So the original lifespan is four years. But the current tires are already in use. Let me see. Let's suppose that the customer is at a point where the current tires have one year remaining. Without repair, they would last one more year, so after that, they have to replace. But if they repair them now, they can get an extra year, so total of two years. \n\nBut then, the cost for the repair option would be $40 for two years. So average cost is 40/2 = 20 per year. That would make the new tires' $45 vs repair's $20, leading to a much higher percentage. But that's not an option here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires have already been used for three years (so one year left), so the repair would give them one more year (total two years from now). So the repair cost is $40 for two years, so $20 per year. But again, this would give a 125% increase (since (45-20)/20 = 1.25, which is 125%, but that's not among the options. Wait, the options include 12.5% which is 1/8. Hmm, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the scenario. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the customer can choose between buying new tires (cost $180, last 4 years) or repairing the current tires each year for $40. Wait, but the repair gives one additional year. So if they repair each year, they can keep using the current tires indefinitely, but each year they pay $40. So the average cost per year would be $40. \n\nWait, that makes more sense. Let me re-read the problem again:\n\n\"A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nHmm, so if they repair the current tires, each repair gives one more year. So each year, they can choose to repair again? Or is it a one-time repair? The problem says \"can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So maybe each repair gives one more year. So if they want to use the current tires beyond their original lifespan, they have to pay $40 per year for each additional year. \n\nWait, perhaps the original tires have a certain lifespan. Let me think again. Let's assume that the current tires, when new, would last four years. But the customer has already used them for some time. Let's say they are at the point where they need to decide between buying new (which would give four more years) or repairing the current ones. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem is that the current tires are at the end of their lifespan. So if you repair them, they can last one more year, but then you have to replace them. So the total cost for the repair option is $40 for one year. So the average cost is $40/year. The new tires would cost $180 for four years, so $45/year. \n\nSo the difference is $45 - $40 = $5. The percentage increase from the repair cost (40) to new cost (45) would be (5/40)*100 = 12.5%. So the answer would be C)12.5%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires can be repaired multiple times. Like, each time you pay $40, you get an extra year. So if you want to use them for four years like the new tires, you would have to repair them three times (since the first repair gives one year, then another repair each subsequent year). Wait, but maybe the problem is considering a single repair. Let's see.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" The wording might imply that the repair is a one-time cost. Because if you have to repair each year, then the cost would be $40 per year, which would be the same as the repair's annual cost. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured so that the customer has a choice between buying new tires (which last four years) or repairing their current tires once, which would give one additional year. Then, after that, they would have to buy new tires. But that complicates the comparison. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the average cost over the same period. Let me think of it as comparing the two options over four years. \n\nIf you buy new tires, you pay $180 for four years, so $45/year. \n\nIf you repair the current tires, but how many years does that cover? If the repair gives one additional year, then you have to choose between: \n\nOption 1: Buy new tires for $180, last 4 years. \n\nOption 2: Repair current tires for $40, which gives 1 year. After that, you have to replace them again. So over four years, you would have to repair four times (each year, paying $40) for four years. So total cost would be 4*$40 = $160. The average cost per year would be $40. \n\nWait, that would make the average cost of new tires $45 vs repair's $40. The difference is 5. So (5/40)*100 = 12.5%, so C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair is a one-time cost that gives an additional year, so for the current tires, if you repair them once, they last one year. Then, after that, you have to buy new ones. So over four years, you could repair them four times, each time getting an extra year, totaling four years. So total cost would be 4*40 = 160. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the customer is comparing the two options over a single year. Like, if they repair the current tires, they can use them for one more year, costing $40. The new tires would cost $180 over four years, but if they only need one year, then the cost would be 180/4 = 45, so comparing 45 vs 40. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So the average cost per year for the new tires is 45, and for the repair option, the cost per year is 40. So the question is how much higher 45 is than 40. \n\nThe formula for percentage increase is ((New - Original)/Original)*100. Here, the original is the repair cost (since it's asking how much greater the new is compared to repair). So (45-40)/40 *100 = (5/40)*100 = 12.5%. That would be option C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nWait, another way: if the customer chooses to repair, they pay $40 for one year. The average cost per year is $40. The new tires' average cost is $45/year. So the difference is $5. \n\nSo 5 is what percentage of 40? 5/40 = 0.125, so 12.5%. So the answer is C. \n\nHmm, that seems right. The options include C as 12.5%. \n\nWait, but let me make sure there's no other interpretation. Suppose that the current tires without repair would last three years, and with repair, they last four. Then the repair cost is $40 for an extra year, so the total cost for four years would be $40, so average is $10 per year. But then new tires are $45, so the percentage would be much higher. But that's not an option. So that's probably not the right way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires can be repaired multiple times. Like, each year you can choose to repair them again. So for four years, you'd pay $40 each year, totaling $160, same as the previous scenario. \n\nYes, so the key is that the repair gives one year per $40. So the average cost per year for repair is $40, while new is $45. The percentage difference is 12.5%. So the answer must be C.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the percentage difference in average annual costs, we first calculate the average cost for each option:\n\n- **New Tires**: Cost $180 for 4 years.  \n  Average cost/year = $180 / 4 = **$45/year**.\n\n- **Repair Current Tires**: Each repair costs $40 and lasts 1 year.  \n  Average cost/year = $40 / 1 = **$40/year**.\n\nThe question asks how much greater the new tires' average cost is compared to the repair cost. Using the percentage increase formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the average cost of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the repair cost.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nAnswer: C",

So the answer must be C.\n\n\nTo determine the percentage difference in average annual costs, we first calculate the average cost for each option:\n\n- **New Tires**: Cost $180 for 4 years.  \n  Average cost/year = $180 / 4 = **$45/year**.\n\n- **Repair Current Tires**: Each repair costs $40 and lasts 1 year.  \n  Average cost/year = $40 / 1 = **$40/year**.\n\nThe question asks how much greater the new tires' average cost is compared to the repair cost. Using the percentage increase formula:  \n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{45 - 40}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{5}{40} \\right) \\times 100 = 12.5\\%.\n\\]\n\nThus, the average cost of new tires is **12.5% greater** than the repair cost.\n\nAnswer: C\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. I need to figure out the percentage difference between the average cost per year of new tires versus repairing the current ones. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the problem says the new tires last four years and cost $180 each. So if you buy new, each tire costs $180 over four years. The average cost per year would be 180 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 180/4 is 45. So that's $45 per year.\n\nNow, for the repair option. The customer can repair the current tires for $40 each, which extends their life by one year. Wait, how many years do the current tires last before needing repair? The question says \"when purchased new, last for four years.\" But the customer already has current tires, so maybe they are used? Wait, the problem isn't entirely clear on how many years the current tires have left. Wait, maybe I need to read that again.\n\nThe question states: \"Tires of a certain brand, when purchased new, last for four years. A customer can choose to purchase the new tires at a cost of $180 per tire or can have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\"\n\nAh, okay. So, the current tires that the customer has are already in use, but how much time do they have left? The problem doesn't specify how many years the current tires have already been used. Wait, maybe the problem is implying that the customer has the option to either replace them now (with new ones that last four years) or repair them to get one more year. Or perhaps the current tires would otherwise last one more year without repair, and with repair, they last two? Or maybe the current tires have already been used for three years and need to be replaced, but the repair gives them one more year? Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is structured so that the customer can choose between buying new tires (which last four years) or repairing the current ones each year. Wait, the question says \"the cost of repairing the current tires\" \u2014 but the repair is a one-time cost that gives an additional year. So perhaps the customer can choose between buying new tires (which last four years) or, instead, repair the current tires once, paying $40 to get one more year. But then, after that year, would they have to repair again?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is comparing over a period of four years. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is comparing the average cost over the same period. Let me see:\n\nThe problem says, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So, perhaps the repair's average cost is over the same time frame as the new tires. Wait, but the new tires last four years. If the repair gives one more year, maybe the customer would need to repair each year? Or perhaps the question is considering a single year?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look at the problem again. Let me read the question carefully once more.\n\nThe question: The average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\n\nHmm. Wait, maybe the repair option is only for one year. Because each repair gives one more year, but the customer can choose to repair each time. But the problem says \"the cost of repairing the current tires\" \u2014 perhaps they mean the cost over the same duration as the new tires. Let me think.\n\nSuppose the customer wants to have tires that last four years. The new tires cost $180 each and last four years, so average cost is $45/year. Alternatively, if they choose to repair the current tires each year, how much would that cost?\n\nWait, but the problem says \"have his current tires repaired at a cost of $40 per tire, a repair that will make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So each repair gives one more year. So if the current tires are already used, and maybe they would otherwise last zero more years? Or perhaps the current tires have one year left? The problem isn't clear on that. Wait, the question says \"when purchased new, last for four years.\" So maybe the current tires have already been used for some time. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering a scenario where the customer is deciding between replacing the current tires with new ones (which will last four years) or repairing the current tires once, which gives them one additional year. But then, after that one year, they would have to decide again. But the question is about the average cost per year. Maybe the problem is comparing over the same time period. Wait, perhaps the question is structured so that the customer is considering a four-year period. Let me see.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the customer has the option to buy new tires now (which last four years) or repair the existing ones now, which would give them one more year. But then, after that year, they might need to repair again. But the problem is asking about the average cost per year of the new tires versus the average cost of the repair option over the same period. But since the new tires last four years, perhaps the repair option would require multiple repairs over four years?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is comparing the cost of new tires over four years versus the cost of repairing the current tires once, which gives one year, but the question is only considering a one-year period? That would make the average cost per year of new tires (180/4 =45) compared to the repair cost of $40. But that would give a difference of 5, which is 12.5% higher (5/40 is 0.125). But then the answer would be C)12.5%. But maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the customer can choose to repair each year, so over four years, they would have to repair four times, paying 40 each year. Then the total cost would be 4*40=160, average per year 40, which would be the same as the repair cost. But then new tires average 45, so 45 vs 40, the difference is 5, so 5/40 is 12.5%. But that would make the answer C. But perhaps the problem is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the current tires are already going to last one year without repair. So the repair adds another year, making them last two years. Wait, but the problem says \"make the current tires last for one additional year.\" So if they were going to last X years without repair, then with repair they last X+1. But since the problem says \"when purchased new, last four years,\" but the current tires might have been used for some time. Since the problem states the customer can choose between buying new or repairing, perhaps the current tires have already been used for three years, so they would last one more year without repair, but with repair, they can last two more years. But this is all speculative.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be simpler. Let me see. The problem says: the new tires cost $180 per tire and last four years. The repair costs $40 per tire and gives one additional year. So if the customer chooses to repair, then each time they repair, they get one more year. But the question is about the average cost per year for each option.\n\nThe question is asking, \"the average cost per year of the new tires is what percent greater than the cost of repairing the current tires?\" So maybe the repair option's cost is considered over the same time period as the new tires. Let me think: if the new tires last four years, then the average cost per year is 180/4=45. The repair option: to get four years of use, how much would repairs cost? Because each repair gives one year. So, to get four years, you need four repairs? Each at $40, so total 160, so average 40 per year. Then 45 vs 40, so 5 more, which is 5/40 = 0.125, so 12.5% increase. So answer C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the repair only gives one additional year. Suppose the current tires are about to expire, so without repair, they can't be used. So if the customer repairs them, they get one year. So comparing over one year, the new tires would cost 180/4 =45 per year, versus the repair's 40. Then the difference is 5, so 5/40=12.5% higher, so answer C again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the customer is choosing between replacing the tires now (for four years) or repairing the current ones now (for one year). But then, after that year, they might have to choose again. But the question is about the average cost per year, so perhaps it's considering the immediate next year. Wait, but the question is phrased as comparing the average cost per year of the new tires versus the cost of repairing. Maybe the repair's cost is considered as a one-time cost for one year, so average cost per year would be 40 (since it's $40 for one year). The new tires' average is 45. So the difference is 5, which is 5/40 = 12.5% higher. So that's C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is different. Let me check the options again. The options are 8%, 10%, 12.5%, 16.7%, 25%. So 12.5 is there, so that might be the answer. But let me think again to make sure.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the repair is a one-time cost but gives one additional year. So if the customer wants to use the current tires for one more year, they pay $40. So the average cost per year for that one year is 40. The new tires would cost 45 per year (over four years). So the new is 5 more per year. So 5/40 is 12.5% higher. So that's correct. So the answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the customer can choose to repair each year, so each year they pay $40. So over four years, the total repair cost would be 4*40=160, so average per year is 40. New tires cost 180 over four years, so average 45. So again, 45 vs 40, 12.5% higher. So that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me think again. Suppose the customer is considering for one year. If they buy new tires, they pay 180, which gives them four years. So per year, 45. If they repair, they pay 40 to get one more year. So the average cost for that year is 40. So the new is 45 vs repair's 40. The question is, what's the percentage increase from repair to new. So (45-40)/40 = 5/40 = 0.125 \u2192 12.5%, which is C. So that must be the answer. So I think the answer is C, 12.5%.\n",
