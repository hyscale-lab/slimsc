      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about a retailer who sold an appliance for 40% above cost, and that 40% markup equals a gross profit of $20. They want to know the selling price. Hmm, right. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that gross profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price. So, if the markup is 40% above cost, then that 40% of the cost should be equal to the $20 profit. Wait, right. Because the markup percentage is usually based on the cost, not the selling price. So, the markup amount here is 40% of the cost, which equals $20. \n\nLet me write that down. Let's let C be the cost price. Then the markup is 40% of C, so 0.4 * C = $20. To find C, I can divide 20 by 0.4. That would give C = 20 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 0.4 is the same as 20 divided by 2/5, which is 20 multiplied by 5/2. 20 times 5 is 100, divided by 2 is 50. So the cost price is $50?\n\nWait, then the selling price is cost plus 40% of cost. So that would be 50 + (0.4*50) = 50 + 20 = $70. So the selling price is $70, which is option D. Hmm, but let me double-check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm mixing up something here. Let me confirm. The problem states that the 40% above cost is the gross profit. Wait, no. Wait a second, the wording says \"sold an appliance for 40 percent above cost, which represented a gross profit of $20.00.\" So the gross profit is the amount over the cost, which is exactly the 40%. So the $20 is the markup, which is 40% of cost. So yes, that's correct. So the cost is 50, selling price is 70. So the answer should be D) $70.00.\n\nLet me check the options again. The options are A)27.30, B)51, C)63, D)70, E)91. So D is there. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Suppose someone thought that the selling price is 140% of cost, and the profit is 40% of cost, which is $20, so yes, that's correct. So cost is 50, selling price is 70. So D is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it another way. Let me set up equations again. Let me denote the cost as C. The selling price S is C plus 40% of C, so S = 1.4*C. The gross profit is S - C = 0.4*C, and that equals $20. So 0.4*C = 20 \u2192 C = 20 / 0.4 = 50. Therefore S is 1.4 *50 =70. Yep, that's exactly what I did before. So the answer must be D. \n\nHmm, the options given include D as 70, so that's the one. I don't see any other possible way this could be interpreted. Unless the question meant that the 40% was on the selling price, but that's not standard. Usually, markup is on cost. So I think D is correct.\n",
