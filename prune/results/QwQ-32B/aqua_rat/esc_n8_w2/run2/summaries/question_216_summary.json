      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the units digit of 9 cubed minus 7. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the units digit after performing that calculation. I remember that units digits often follow certain patterns when you take exponents. Like, maybe 9 raised to some power has a repeating pattern in its last digit?\n\nFirst, let me figure out what 9^3 is. Well, 9 times 9 is 81, then 81 times 9 again. Let's calculate that. 81 multiplied by 9: 80*9 is 720, and 1*9 is 9, so total is 729. So 9^3 is 729. The units digit here is 9, right? Because 729 ends with a 9.\n\nNow I have to subtract 7 from that. So 729 minus 7 would be 722. Wait, the units digit here would be 2? Because 9 minus 7 is 2. But hold on, maybe I should check if there's a borrow involved here? Let me think again. \n\nWait, 729 minus 7: the units digit is 9, subtract 7 gives 2, yes. Because 9 -7 is 2. So the result's units digit is 2. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Let me write it out:\n\n9^3 = 729. Then subtract 7: 729 -7 = 722. The units digit of 722 is 2. So the answer should be D) 2?\n\nWait, but the options given are A)1, B)3, C)5, D)2, E)4. So D is an option. That seems right. But maybe I made a mistake in the exponent?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the units digit patterns for 9's powers. Let me think. The units digit of 9^1 is 9, 9^2 is 81 so 1, 9^3 is 9*1=9 again? Wait, 9^3's units digit would cycle every 2? Like 9, 1, 9,1... So 9^1 is 9, 9^2 ends with 1, 9^3 would end with 9 again, 9^4 ends with 1, etc. So 9^3's units digit is 9. Then subtracting 7, so 9-7 is 2. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the subtraction again. Let's do the actual calculation:\n\n9^3 = 729. 729 minus 7 is 722. The last digit is 2. So the answer must be D. The options include D as 2. So that's the correct choice.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe units digit of 9^3 can be determined by observing the pattern in the units digits of powers of 9.

Subtracting 7 from this result (9 - 7) gives a units digit of 2. Verifying with direct calculation: 9^3 = 729, and 729 - 7 = 722, which indeed has a units digit of 2. \n\nAnswer: D",

Let's compute that step by step. 9 times 9 is 81. Then 81 times 9. Wait, but maybe I can just track the units digit here.
