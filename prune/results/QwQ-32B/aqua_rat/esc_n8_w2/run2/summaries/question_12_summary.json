      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this stapler problem. Hmm, so the question says that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. Then, 2% of the non-defective ones were rejected by mistake. And we know that 72 of the non-defective were rejected. We need to find the total number produced that day. \n\nAlright, let me break this down step by step. Let's denote the total number of staplers produced as N. \n\nFirst, 10% are defective, so the defective ones are 0.10*N. That means the non-defective ones are 90% of N, which is 0.90*N. \n\nNow, out of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected. The problem states that this number equals 72. So, 2% of the non-defective staplers is 72. \n\nLet me write that as an equation. The non-defective is 0.90N, so 2% of that is 0.02 * 0.90N. That should equal 72. \n\nSo: 0.02 * 0.90 * N = 72. \n\nLet me calculate that. 0.02 times 0.9 is 0.018. So 0.018*N =72. To find N, divide both sides by 0.018. \n\nHmm, 72 divided by 0.018. Let me do that calculation. \n\nWait, 72 divided by 0.018. Let's see, 0.018 times 4000 is 72, because 0.018 * 4000 = 72. Wait, let me check that. \n\n0.018 * 4000: 4000 * 0.01 is 40, so 4000 *0.018 is 4000*(0.01+0.008) = 40 + 32 = 72. Oh right! So N would be 4000? But wait, looking at the options, option A is 4000. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps. \n\nWait, let me go through again. Let's see:\n\nTotal staplers: N\n\nDefective: 10% of N \u2192 0.10N. Non-defective: 0.90N.\n\nOf the non-defective, 2% were rejected. So 2% of 0.90N is 0.02 * 0.90N = 0.018N. \n\nThis equals 72. So 0.018N =72 \u2192 N =72 /0.018 = 4000. \n\nHmm, so that would be answer A. But wait, let me check the options again. The options given are A through E, with A being 4,000. But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me re-read it. \n\n\"10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected...\" \n\nYes, that's exactly how I interpreted it. So the 2% is of the non-defective. So the calculation seems right. \n\nWait, but the options include 4,800 (option D). Let me check if maybe I messed up the percentages. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it with variables again. Let me try again. \n\nLet total be N. \n\nDefective: 10% of N \u2192 0.1N. So non-defective: N - 0.1N = 0.9N. \n\nOf those non-defective, 2% were rejected. So rejected non-defective = 0.02*(0.9N) = 0.018N. \n\nGiven that this is 72. \n\n0.018N =72 \u2192 N =72 /0.018. \n\nCalculating 72 divided by 0.018: \n\nLet me compute this step by step. \n\n0.018 \u00d7 4000 = 72? Let's compute 0.018 \u00d7 4000. \n\n4000 \u00d7 0.01 =40. \n\n4000 \u00d7 0.008 =32. \n\nSo 40+32=72. Yes. So N=4000. So the answer should be A. \n\nWait, but why does the problem feel like maybe I missed something? Let me check if the question is asking for the total number of staplers produced, which is N. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's confusion between defective and non-defective. Let me see. The 2% rejection is only on the non-defective, so the 72 is exactly the 2% of non-defective. So the steps are correct. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is indeed A. But let me check the options again. The options given are A)4000, B)4200, C)4500, D)4800, E)5000. \n\nHmm, so 4000 is an option. So the correct answer is A. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another way. \n\nSuppose N is 4000. \n\n10% defective: 400 defective, so 3600 non-defective. \n\n2% of 3600 is 0.02 *3600 =72. Exactly matches the problem. So that works. \n\nSo the answer is A. But why would the options include higher numbers? Maybe a common mistake would be to think that 2% of total? Let me see. \n\nSuppose someone thought 2% of total staplers, not non-defective. Then 0.02*N =72 \u2192 N=3600, but that's not an option. Alternatively, maybe they thought 2% of defective? No, the problem says non-defective. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the percentage steps. Wait, let me think again. \n\nAnother approach: \n\nLet the total be N. \n\nNon-defective staplers: 90% of N \u2192 0.9N. \n\n2% of these non-defective are rejected: so 72 = 2% of 0.9N. \n\nSo 72 = (2/100)*(90/100)*N \u2192 72 = (18/1000)N \u2192 N = 72 * (1000/18). \n\nCalculating 72 divided by 18 is 4. So 4 * 1000 =4000. Yep, that's the same. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be A. \n\nHmm, but why is the option D)4800 there? Let me see if perhaps I misread the question. Wait, maybe the 2% is of all the staplers, not of the non-defective? Let me check the question again. \n\nThe question says: \"2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.\" So it's 2% of non-defective. So my calculation is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant that 2% of all the non-defective were rejected, but the total rejected includes both defective and non-defective? Wait, no, the problem says \"72 of the non-defective were rejected\", so that 72 is exactly the 2% of the non-defective. \n\nSo yeah, I think the answer is A. But maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Wait, let me check once more. \n\nIf N is 4000:\n\nTotal defective: 400, non-defective 3600. 2% of 3600 is 72. That matches. \n\nSo the answer is A. \n\nWait, but the options given in the problem include option D)4800. Let me see if maybe I misread the percentages. The first percentage is 10% defective, so non-defective is 90%. Then 2% of that 90% is 1.8% of total. 1.8% of N is 72. \n\nSo 1.8% of N =72 \u2192 N =72/(0.018)=4000. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is A. So the correct option is A)4,000. \n\nWait, but why would the options have higher numbers? Maybe I made a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question. Let me see. \n\nWait another way to think: suppose the 2% is of the total non-defective after some other process. But no, the question states clearly that 2% of the non-defective were rejected. \n\nI think the answer must be A. So I'll go with that.\n",

The options are A through E.\n\nAlright, let's break it down step by step. Let me denote the total number of staplers produced as, let's say, N. That's the number we need to find.\n\nFirst, 10% of N are defective. So the defective staplers would be 0.10 * N. That leaves the non-defective ones as 90% of N, right? Because 100% -10% is 90%. So non-defective = 0.90*N.\n\nNow, the next part says that 2% of these non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. And that number is given as 72. So, 2% of the non-defective equals 72. Let me write that equation out.\n\nSo, 2% of (0.90*N) = 72. In math terms, that's 0.02 * (0.90 * N) = 72.\n\nHmm, let's compute that. Multiply 0.02 and 0.90 first. 0.02 *0.9 is 0.018. So 0.018*N =72.\n\nTo find N, divide both sides by 0.018. So N =72 /0.018. Let me calculate that.\n\nHmm, 72 divided by 0.018. Let's see. Well, 72 divided by 0.018 is the same as 72 divided by 18/1000, which is 72 multiplied by 1000/18. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, 72 divided by 18 is 4. So 4 times 1000 is 4000.

So 0.018N =72 \u2192 N=72/0.018.\n\nCalculating 72 divided by 0.018. Let me do this step again. 0.018 times 4000 equals 0.018*4000. 0.01*4000 is 40, 0.008*4000 is 32. So 40 +32=72. Oh right, so 0.018*4000=72. That's correct. So N is 4000, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)4,000, B)4,200, C)4,500, D)4,800, E)5,000. So A is indeed the first option. Hmm, but sometimes I might have messed up the percentages. Let me see another way.\n\nSuppose the total is 4000. Then 10% defective is 400. So non-defective is 3600. 2% of 3600 is 0.02*3600=72. Which matches exactly the given number. So yes, that works. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me check if maybe I misread the problem. For instance, does the 2% apply to all staplers or just non-defective? The question says \"2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.\" So yes, that's exactly what I used.

Let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a calculation mistake.\n\nTotal staplers N. 10% defective, so 0.1N defective, 0.9N non-defective. 2% of non-defective are rejected: 0.02 *0.9N = 72. So 0.018N =72 \u2192 N=72/0.018.\n\nCalculating 72 divided by 0.018. Let me do this step again. 0.018 times 4000 equals 0.018*4000. 0.01*4000 is 40, 0.008*4000 is 32. So 40 +32=72. Oh right, so 0.018*4000=72. That's correct. So N is 4000, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)4,000, B)4,200, C)4,500, D)4,800, E)5,000. So A is indeed the first option. Hmm, but sometimes I might have messed up the percentages. Let me see another way.\n\nSuppose the total is 4000. Then 10% defective is 400. So non-defective is 3600. 2% of 3600 is 0.02*3600=72. Which matches exactly the given number. So yes, that works. So the answer should be A.\n\nWait, but let me check if maybe I misread the problem. For instance, does the 2% apply to all staplers or just non-defective? The question says \"2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.\" So yes, that's exactly what I used. So 2% of non-defective (which is 90% of total) gives the 72. So the calculation is correct. Therefore the answer is A)4,000.\n\n\nThe problem states that 10% of the staplers produced were defective, leaving 90% as non-defective. Of these non-defective staplers, 2% were incorrectly rejected, totaling 72. Let \\( N \\) be the total number of staplers. The non-defective staplers amount to \\( 0.90N \\). The rejected non-defectives are \\( 0.02 \\times 0.90N = 0.018N \\). Setting this equal to 72 gives \\( 0.018N = 72 \\), so \\( N = \\frac{72}{0.018} = 4000 \\). Verifying, 10% of 4000 is 400 defective, leaving 3600 non-defective. 2% of 3600 is indeed 72. Thus, the correct answer is A.\n\nAnswer: A",
