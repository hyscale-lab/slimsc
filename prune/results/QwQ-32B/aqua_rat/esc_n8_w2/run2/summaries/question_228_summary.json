      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about combinations, right? So, we have a box with balls numbered from 1 to n. We need to find n such that the number of ways to choose two balls without selecting the one numbered 3 is 45. Hmm.\n\nWait, the key here is that the ball numbered 3 isn't selected. So, the total number of ways to choose two balls without including ball 3 would be the same as choosing two balls from all the balls except ball 3. Since there are n balls total, removing one (the 3) leaves us with n-1 balls. The number of ways to choose two from those would be combination (n-1 choose 2). And that's equal to 45.\n\nSo the equation should be C(n-1, 2) = 45. Let me remember the combination formula: C(n, k) is n!/(k!(n-k)!). So substituting, (n-1)*(n-2)/2 = 45. Because for k=2, it's (n-1)*(n-2)/2!.\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 gives (n-1)(n-2) = 90. Now I need to solve for n here. Let's expand the left side: n\u00b2 - 3n + 2 = 90. Then subtract 90: n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0. Hmm, solving this quadratic equation. Let me see if I can factor it. Let's look for two numbers that multiply to -88 and add to -3. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, using quadratic formula: n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] /2. Because discriminant is 9 + 4*88 = 9+352=361. sqrt(361)=19. So n=(3+19)/2 = 22/2=11, or (3-19)/2 which is negative. So n=11. \n\nWait but let me check if that makes sense. Let me plug back in. If n=11, then n-1 is 10. So C(10,2)= 10*9/2=45. Yep, that's exactly the number given. So the answer should be A)11. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)11, B)10 etc. So A is the first option. \n\nWait but hold on, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me think again. The problem states that the number of ways where 3 is not selected is 45. The total number of ways to choose two balls is C(n,2). The number of ways where 3 is not selected is C(n-1,2), right? Because excluding the 3, so yes. So the setup is correct. So solving gives n=11, so the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone could think of it as total ways minus the ways that include the 3. Wait, but the problem states that the 45 is the number of ways that do not include the 3. So the way I approached it is correct. \n\nHmm, seems correct. So the answer should be A)11.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a box with balls numbered from 1 to n. The question says that there are 45 different ways to select two balls such that the ball numbered 3 isn't selected. I need to find the value of n. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when selecting two balls from a set, the number of ways to do that is given by the combination formula C(n, 2), which is n(n-1)/2. But here, the condition is that ball number 3 isn't selected. So I need to adjust the total number of balls available for selection.\n\nWait, right, if ball 3 can't be chosen, then effectively we're choosing two balls from the remaining (n-1) balls. Because we exclude ball number 3. So the number of ways should be C(n-1, 2). And according to the problem, that equals 45. \n\nSo the equation would be: (n-1)*(n-2)/2 = 45. \n\nLet me write that down properly. \n\nThe combination formula for choosing 2 out of (n-1) is (n-1 choose 2) = [(n-1)(n-2)] / 2. \n\nSet that equal to 45:\n\n[(n-1)(n-2)] / 2 = 45\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) = 90\n\nNow I need to solve for n here. Let's expand the left side:\n\nn\u00b2 - 3n + 2 = 90\n\nSubtract 90 from both sides:\n\nn\u00b2 - 3n + 2 - 90 = 0 \u2192 n\u00b2 - 3n -88 = 0\n\nHmm, quadratic equation. Let's see if I can factor this. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -88 and add up to -3. Wait, factors of 88 are like 8 and 11, 8*11 is 88. Let me see:\n\nIf I have 11 and -8, then 11 * (-8) = -88 and 11 + (-8) = 3. But the middle term is -3n. Hmm, maybe the equation is n\u00b2 -11n + 8n -88 =0? Wait, no, maybe I need to think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the quadratic setup. Let me check the steps again.\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying both sides by 2:\n\n(n-1)(n-2) = 90 \u2192 n\u00b2 - 3n +2 =90 \u2192 n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0. That's correct.\n\nSo trying to factor n\u00b2 -3n -88 =0. Let me see. Let's think of factors of 88 that subtract to 3. Hmm, since the product is negative, one is positive and the other negative. Let's see:\n\nLooking for two numbers a and b such that a * b = -88 and a + b = -3. Wait, actually, the equation is n\u00b2 + (a + b)n +ab =0. Wait, perhaps I should use the quadratic formula here.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [3 \u00b1 sqrt(9 + 352)] / 2 because the discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b=-3, c= -88. So discriminant is (-3)^2 -4(1)(-88) = 9 + 352 = 361. sqrt(361) is 19.\n\nSo n = [3 \u00b119]/2. \n\nSo possible solutions: (3 +19)/2 = 22/2=11, and (3-19)/2 = -16/2 = -8. Since n can't be negative, n=11. \n\nSo the answer should be A) 11?\n\nWait, but let me check that again. Let me plug n=11 back into the original equation. (11-1)*(11-2)/2 = (10*9)/2 = 90/2=45. Exactly. So that works. So n=11 is correct. So the answer is option A.\n\nBut wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)11, B)10, etc. So yes, A is 11. So that should be the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read again. The problem states that the total number of ways where ball 3 is not selected is 45. So when we exclude ball 3, there are n-1 balls left, so the combinations are indeed C(n-1,2) =45. So solving that gives n=11, which is option A. So yeah, that's the right answer.\n",
