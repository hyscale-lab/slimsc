      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about dividing Rs. 5100 between two sons, Mohan and Sohan, such that when their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, they'll have equal amounts when they turn 26. Mohan is 23 and Sohan is 24 now. Hmm, so I need to figure out how much each gets now so that in the future, their investments grow to the same amount by the time they're both 26.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how many years each will have their money invested. Mohan is 23, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he has 2 years until 26. So Mohan's money will be invested for 3 years, and Sohan's for 2 years. The idea is that when their shares are compounded for those periods, they end up equal. \n\nLet me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. The total is M + S = 5100. \n\nThe formula for compound amount is P*(1 + r)^t, where r is the rate (4% so 0.04) and t the time in years. Since the amounts need to be equal when they reach 26, so:\n\nM*(1 + 0.04)^3 = S*(1 + 0.04)^2 \n\nWe can set up that equation. Let me simplify this. \n\nDivide both sides by (1.04)^2, so we get M*(1.04) = S. \n\nSo S = 1.04*M. \n\nBut we also know that M + S = 5100. Substitute S with 1.04M:\n\nM + 1.04M = 5100 \u2192 2.04M = 5100 \u2192 M = 5100 / 2.04. \n\nLet me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 5100 divided by 2.04. Let me see. 2.04 times 2500 is 5100? Wait, 2.04*2500 would be 2500*2 + 2500*0.04 = 5000 + 100 = 5100. Oh! Wait a second, that's exactly right. \n\nSo 2.04*M = 5100 \u2192 M = 2500. Wait, but then S would be 1.04*2500 = 2600. But then total would be 2500 +2600 =5100, which matches. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check again. The equation was M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2. So dividing both sides by (1.04)^2 gives M*(1.04) = S. So S is indeed 1.04*M. \n\nTherefore, substituting into the total sum: M + 1.04M = 2.04M = 5100 \u2192 M = 5100 / 2.04. \n\nLet me compute that division properly. 5100 divided by 2.04. Let me see:\n\n2.04 * 2500 = 5100? Let me do 2.04 * 2500. 2.04 * 2500 = (2 + 0.04)*2500 = 2*2500 + 0.04*2500 = 5000 + 100 = 5100. Exactly. So M is 2500. \n\nSo Mohan's share is 2500. Looking at the options, B is 2500. So the answer should be B. Wait, but let me check again to make sure I didn't mix up the times. \n\nWait, Mohan is getting M, which is invested for 3 years, and Sohan's S is invested for 2 years. The equation is correct. Because after 3 years, Mohan's amount would be M*(1.04)^3, and Sohan's would be S*(1.04)^2. Setting those equal gives the equation. \n\nYes, so that's correct. Therefore the answer is B)2500. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)2400, B)2500, C)2600, D)2700, E)None. Since 2500 is an option, so B is correct. \n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me confirm the math once more. Suppose Mohan gets 2500. Sohan gets 2600. \n\nMohan's amount after 3 years: 2500*(1.04)^3. \n\nSohan's after 2 years: 2600*(1.04)^2. \n\nLet me compute both. \n\nFirst, (1.04)^2 is 1.0816. \n\nSo Sohan's amount is 2600 * 1.0816 = let's see. 2600 *1.0816. \n\n2600 *1 =2600, 2600*0.08=208, 2600*0.0016=4.16. Adding those: 2600+208=2808 +4.16=2812.16. \n\nNow Mohan's amount after 3 years: 2500*(1.04)^3. \n\nFirst, (1.04)^3 is 1.124864 (since 1.04^2 is 1.0816, times 1.04 again: 1.0816 *1.04. Let's compute that:\n\n1.0816 * 1.04: \n\n1.0816 * 1 =1.0816\n\n1.0816 *0.04 =0.043264\n\nTotal: 1.0816 +0.043264 =1.124864.\n\nSo 2500 *1.124864 = ?\n\n2500 *1.124864. Let's calculate:\n\n2500 *1 =2500,\n\n2500 *0.124864 = 2500 *0.12 =300, plus 2500*0.004864 = 12.16. So 300+12.16=312.16. \n\nTotal is 2500 +312.16 = 2812.16. \n\nYes, both amounts equal 2812.16. So the calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B)2500.\n",

The father wants to divide the money such that when their shares are invested at 4% compound interest, they'll have equal amounts when they turn 26. I need to find Mohan's share. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me note down the key points. Mohan is 23, so he'll be 26 in 3 years. Sohan is 24, so he'll be 26 in 2 years. The total amount is 5100, which is split into two parts. Let me denote Mohan's share as M and Sohan's as S. So M + S = 5100.\n\nThe condition is that when each of their shares is invested at 4% compound interest, their amounts at age 26 will be equal. Since compound interest is involved, the formula for the amount after t years is A = P*(1 + r/100)^t. Here, the rate r is 4%.\n\nSo for Mohan, his amount after 3 years will be M*(1 + 0.04)^3. For Sohan, his amount after 2 years will be S*(1 + 0.04)^2. These two amounts should be equal.\n\nSo setting up the equation: M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2. \n\nHmm, simplifying this equation. Let's see, if I divide both sides by (1.04)^2, I get M*(1.04) = S. So S = 1.04*M. \n\nWait, that's interesting. So Sohan's share is 1.04 times Mohan's share. But since the total is 5100, we can write M + 1.04*M = 5100. \n\nSo that would be 2.04*M = 5100. Then M would be 5100 divided by 2.04. Let me compute that.\n\nWait, let me double-check the time periods. Mohan is 23, so 26 -23 = 3 years. Sohan is 24, so 26-24=2 years. So yes, the time periods are correct. The exponents are 3 and 2 respectively. \n\nSo the equation is correct. Let me compute M = 5100 / 2.04. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 5100 divided by 2.04. \n\nHmm, 2.04 times 2500 is 5100? Let me check: 2.04 * 2500 = 2500 *2 + 2500*0.04 = 5000 + 100 = 5100. Oh wait! Wait, so 2.04 * 2500 is exactly 5100. So that would mean that M is 2500? Because 2.04*M =5100 \u2192 M=2500. Wait, so that would mean Mohan's share is 2500, and Sohan's is 1.04*2500 = 2600. Then 2500+2600=5100. \n\nWait, but then the options given are A)2400, B)2500, etc. So B is 2500. That would be the answer? Let me confirm again.\n\nWait, but let me make sure. Let me think again. The equation was M*(1.04)^3 = S*(1.04)^2. So dividing both sides by (1.04)^2 gives M*(1.04) = S. So S = M *1.04. \n\nTherefore, the total is M + 1.04M = 2.04 M = 5100. So M is 5100 /2.04. Let me calculate 5100 divided by 2.04. \n\nAlternatively, 2.04 * 2500 = 5100. Because 2.04 * 1000 is 2040, so 2040*2.5 = 5100. Wait, 2.04*2500 is indeed 2500*2 + 2500*0.04 = 5000 + 100 =5100. So yes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, Mohan's share is 2500. So the answer should be B. Let me check the options again. The options are A)2400, B)2500, C)2600, D)2700, E)None.

The total amount is \\( M + S = 5100 \\).\n\nThe future value of Mohan's share after 3 years at 4% is \\( M \\times (1 + 0.04)^3 \\). The future value of Sohan's share after 2 years is \\( S \\times (1 + 0.04)^2 \\). These must be equal:\n\n\\[\nM \\times (1.04)^3 = S \\times (1.04)^2\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by \\( (1.04)^2 \\):\n\n\\[\nM \\times 1.04 = S\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( S = 1.04M \\) into the total amount equation:\n\n\\[\nM + 1.04M = 5100 \\implies 2.04M = 5100 \\implies M = \\frac{5100}{2.04} = 2500\n\\]\n\nThus, Mohan's share is **Rs. 2500**, which corresponds to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
