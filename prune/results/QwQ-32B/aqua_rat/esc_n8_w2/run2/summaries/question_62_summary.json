      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so here's this problem: Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. The sum of R and T's ages is 50. We need to find the difference between R and Q's age. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the wording. \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T.\" That sounds like the difference between R and Q's age is the same as the difference between Q and T's age. So like, R - Q equals Q - T. Because if Q is younger than R by X years, then Q is older than T by the same X years. So R - Q = Q - T. That makes sense. So the age difference between R and Q is the same as between Q and T, so Q is exactly in the middle of R and T in age. Wait, so that would mean that Q's age is the average of R and T's ages?\n\nWait, let me write that down. Let me assign variables. Let R's age be R, Q's age be Q, and T's age be T. \n\nThe first statement: Q is younger than R by the same amount he is older than T. So R - Q = Q - T. Rearranged, that gives R + T = 2Q. Oh right, because if you add R and T, you get 2Q. So that's interesting.\n\nThe second part says the sum of R and T's ages is 50. So R + T = 50. Wait, but from the first equation, R + T = 2Q. So substituting, 2Q = 50. Therefore, Q must be 25. \n\nSo Q is 25. Now, the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. Let me see. Since R - Q = Q - T, and R + T =50, but how do we find R - Q?\n\nLet me see. Since R + T =50 and R - Q = Q - T, maybe I can express R and T in terms of Q. Let me see. Let me denote the difference as D. Let D = R - Q. Then, since R - Q = Q - T, that means Q - T is also D, so T = Q - D. \n\nNow R is Q + D. So R = Q + D, T = Q - D. Then, R + T = (Q + D) + (Q - D) = 2Q. Which matches the earlier equation. Since R + T is 50, then 2Q is 50, so Q is 25. \n\nSo R is 25 + D, T is 25 - D. Then, the difference between R and Q's age is D. But we need to find the value of D. But how?\n\nThe problem gives that R + T is 50, but we already used that to find Q. So unless there's another equation, perhaps we can't find D. Wait, the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age, which is D. But from the given information, can we determine D?\n\nHmm, since R + T =50, and R = 25 + D, T =25 - D, so substituting into R + T gives (25+D) + (25 - D) =50, which is 50 =50, which is always true. So D can be any value? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, but the ages have to be positive, right? So T's age must be positive. So T =25 - D must be greater than 0. So 25 - D >0 \u2192 D <25. Similarly, R =25 + D must be positive, but since D is a positive number (since R is older than Q), then R is okay as long as D is positive. But the problem doesn't give any more constraints. \n\nTherefore, D can be any value less than 25. So the difference between R and Q's age (which is D) can't be determined because it depends on D. So the answer would be D) Cannot be determined?\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options include E) None of the above. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me see again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the difference between R and Q's age\" \u2014 which is exactly D. Since D can be any value, but the problem might have some constraints. Wait, but the problem says \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T\". So the difference must be positive. But since R and T's sum is fixed at 50, but their individual ages can vary as long as they are equidistant from Q's age (25). \n\nFor example, if R is 30, then T is 20, so D is 5. The difference between R and Q is 5, and between Q and T is 5. The sum R+T is 50. So here the difference would be 5. But if R is 35, then T would be 15, making the difference D =10, so the difference between R and Q would be 10. So the answer could be any even number? Wait, but the options given are 22, 27, 29, D, or E. Since D can be any number up to 25, but the options don't include any of these numbers except maybe 22 or 29, which are higher than 25? Wait, no. Wait, 25 is the maximum possible D? Because T's age must be positive. So D can be up to 25. For example, if D is 25, then T would be 0, which is not possible, so D must be less than 25. So the maximum possible D approaches 25 but can't reach it. \n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify that the ages are integers. So unless there's some other constraint, the difference could be any value between 0 and 25. Since the question asks for \"definitely the difference\", but since it's not fixed, it can't be determined. So the answer should be D) Cannot be determined. \n\nLooking at the options, option D is \"Cannot be determined\". So the correct answer is D?\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about ages, so I need to set up some equations here. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\nSo, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. Hmm, that part might need some translation into math. Let's break it down. \n\nThe first part says Q is younger than R by some amount, and that same amount is how much older Q is than T. So, the difference between R and Q's age is the same as the difference between Q and T's age. Let me write that out.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let R's age be R, Q's age be Q, and T's age be T. \n\nThe problem states that Q is younger than R by the same amount that Q is older than T. So, R - Q = Q - T. That makes sense because the difference between R and Q is the same as between Q and T, but in opposite directions. So R is older than Q by that amount, and Q is older than T by the same amount. \n\nSo the equation would be R - Q = Q - T. \n\nThen the second part says the sum of R and T's ages is 50. So R + T = 50. \n\nWe need to find the difference between R and Q's age. Wait, the question says \"What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\" But from the first equation, R - Q is equal to (Q - T), so the difference between R and Q is the same as between Q and T. But the question is asking for the difference between R and Q. So, R - Q is the difference. But how do we find its value?\n\nHmm. Let me see. Let me try to express variables in terms of each other. \n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R + T = 2Q. \n\nWait, if I rearrange the first equation, adding T and R to both sides and subtracting 2Q, I get R + T = 2Q. \n\nWait, let me check that again. \n\nOriginal equation: R - Q = Q - T. \n\nIf I add Q to both sides and add T to both sides, I get R + T = 2Q. Exactly. \n\nSo equation 1 gives R + T = 2Q. \n\nBut the second equation says R + T = 50. \n\nSo substituting equation 2 into equation 1's rearrangement: 50 = 2Q \u2192 Q = 25. \n\nSo Q is 25 years old. \n\nNow, the question is asking for the difference between R and Q's age. That's R - Q. \n\nBut we need to find R - Q. From the first equation, R - Q = Q - T. \n\nBut since we know that R + T =50 and Q is 25, perhaps we can find R and T's individual ages? \n\nWait, let me see. Let me think. \n\nWe have R + T = 50. \n\nAlso, R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R -25 =25 - T \u2192 R + T = 50. Wait, that's the same as the second equation. \n\nHmm, so substituting Q=25 into the first equation gives R -25 = 25 - T \u2192 R + T = 50, which is exactly the same as the second equation. So that means there are infinitely many solutions here. \n\nSo, for example, let's say R is 30, then T would be 20 (since 30 +20=50). Then R-Q is 5, Q-T is 5, which satisfies the first condition. The difference between R and Q would be 5 here. \n\nAlternatively, if R is 40, then T would be 10. Then R-Q is 15, and Q-T is 15. So the difference would be 15. \n\nWait a second, so the difference between R and Q could be any number as long as R + T equals 50 and the differences are equal. But the problem is asking \"What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\" So since there are multiple possibilities (like 5, 15, etc.), the answer can't be determined? \n\nLooking at the options, D is \"Cannot be determined\" and E is \"None of the above\". \n\nWait, but let me check again. Because the problem says \"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T\". So the difference between R and Q must equal the difference between Q and T, so the total R - T would be 2*(R-Q). \n\nBut R + T =50, so R-T = 2*(R - Q). Let me write equations again. \n\nLet me let D be the difference between R and Q. So D = R - Q. Then Q - T = D as well. \n\nSo, R = Q + D, and T = Q - D. \n\nThen R + T = (Q + D) + (Q - D) = 2Q. \n\nWhich again gives R + T = 2Q =50 \u2192 Q=25. \n\nSo R = 25 + D and T=25 - D. \n\nThen R + T = (25+D)+(25 - D) =50, which checks out. \n\nNow, the problem is asking for the difference between R and Q, which is D. But D can be any value such that T must be a positive age. Because age can't be negative. \n\nSo T =25 - D must be greater than 0. So 25 - D >0 \u2192 D <25. Similarly, R =25 + D must be a valid age, but since R is part of the sum 50, as long as D is positive. \n\nTherefore, the difference D can be any value between 0 and 25 (but D has to be positive, since Q is younger than R and older than T). So D can be 1, 2, ..., up to 24, 25 (if T is 0, but maybe T has to be at least a year old, but the problem doesn't specify). \n\nTherefore, since D can be any of these values, the difference between R and Q's age isn't fixed. So the answer should be D) Cannot be determined. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options again, option D is \"Cannot be determined\". So the answer is D? \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)22, B)27, C)29, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of the above. \n\nHmm. Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. Did I miss something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here.

So R-Q = Q-T. \n\nThen R + T = 2Q, and R+T is 50. So Q must be 25. \n\nSo the difference R-Q is equal to (R - Q), but since R = 2Q - T (from R + T =2Q?), Wait, maybe I should think of variables. \n\nWait, R + T =50 and R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R-T=2(Q-T). Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the difference between R and Q is D. So R = Q + D, and T = Q - D. \n\nThus, R + T = (Q + D) + (Q - D) = 2Q. \n\nWhich is 50, so Q is 25. \n\nThe difference between R and Q is D. But since T must be positive, D can be any value less than 25, so D can vary. \n\nTherefore, the difference isn't fixed.

So Q must be 25. \n\nSo the difference R-Q is equal to (R - Q), but since R = 2Q - T (from R + T =2Q?), Wait, maybe I should think of variables. \n\nWait, R + T =50 and R - Q = Q - T \u2192 R-T=2(Q-T). Wait, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the difference between R and Q is D. So R = Q + D, and T = Q - D. \n\nThus, R + T = (Q + D) + (Q - D) = 2Q. \n\nWhich is 50, so Q is 25. \n\nThe difference between R and Q is D. But since T must be positive, D can be any value less than 25, so D can vary. \n\nTherefore, the difference isn't fixed. The problem says \"What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\" Since it's not fixed, the answer is D. \n\nSo the correct answer is D) Cannot be determined.\n\n\nThe problem states that Q is younger than R by the same amount that Q is older than T, leading to the equation \\( R - Q = Q - T \\). This simplifies to \\( R + T = 2Q \\). Additionally, we know \\( R + T = 50 \\). Combining these, \\( 2Q = 50 \\), so \\( Q = 25 \\). The difference between R and Q's age is \\( R - Q \\), but since \\( R = 25 + D \\) and \\( T = 25 - D \\) (where \\( D \\) is the difference), \\( D \\) can vary as long as \\( T \\) remains positive. Since \\( D \\) is not fixed, the difference between R and Q's ages cannot be definitively determined.\n\nAnswer: D",
