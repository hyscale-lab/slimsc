      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here about the height of a room and the cost to paper the walls. Hmm, the question gives a ratio of height to semi-perimeter as 2:5. And there's some information about the cost and the paper's width and price. Oh right, and they subtract 15 sq.m for doors and windows. I need to find the height.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The ratio of height to semi-perimeter is 2:5. The semi-perimeter probably refers to half the perimeter of the room's floor, right? Wait, the perimeter of the walls would be the perimeter of the room's base. Since the room is a rectangular room (I assume), the perimeter would be 2*(length + width). So semi-perimeter would be (length + width). Wait, but the problem says \"semi-perimeter\" so maybe it's half the perimeter. Wait, no. Wait, maybe the term is used differently here. Let me think again. If the ratio is height to semi-perimeter, then semi-perimeter must be half the perimeter. Because otherwise the ratio would be height to perimeter, but maybe the problem uses semi-perimeter as (length + width). Let me confirm that. For example, if the room is a rectangle, the perimeter is 2(l + w). So semi-perimeter (half the perimeter) would be (l + w). So the ratio given is height : semi-perimeter (which is l + w) is 2:5. So height / (l + w) = 2/5. Let me note that down.\n\nLet me denote the height as h. So h/(l + w) = 2/5 \u2192 h = (2/5)(l + w). Got that.\n\nNow, the cost is given for papering the walls. The total cost is Rs.260. The paper is 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost per meter of paper is Rs.2. Wait, the cost per meter\u2014probably per meter in length? So the cost would depend on the total area of the paper needed, right?\n\nWait, let me think. The cost is calculated based on the area of the paper used, but since the paper is sold by the meter (per meter length?), but the width is 50cm. Hmm, maybe the cost is Rs.2 per meter of the paper's length. So each meter of paper (so each meter in length) would have an area of 0.5 meters (width) times 1 meter (length) \u2192 0.5 m\u00b2 per meter of paper. Wait, but the cost is Rs.2 per meter. So perhaps the cost is Rs.2 per running meter of the paper. Wait, maybe the question is saying that each meter length of the paper (so each meter in length, with the width being 50cm) costs Rs.2. So the price per square meter of the paper would be (Rs.2 per meter length) divided by 0.5 m\u00b2 per meter length? Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of total area. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, the cost is calculated as follows: the total area of the walls (minus doors and windows) is equal to the area of the paper used. The paper comes in rolls of 50 cm wide. So the total area required is (total area needed) divided by the width (to get the length needed). Then, the cost would be (total area / width) * cost per meter. Wait, maybe. Let me structure this step by step.\n\nFirst, the total area to be covered with wallpaper, excluding doors and windows, is (total wall area) - 15 sq.m. The total wall area is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height. Because each wall's area is height multiplied by length or width, so adding all four walls: 2*(l + w)*h. So total wall area is perimeter * height. But since the semi-perimeter is (l + w), then perimeter is 2*(l + w). So total wall area is 2*(l + w)*h. Then subtracting 15 gives the area to be covered. So the area to be covered with paper is [2*(l + w)*h - 15] square meters.\n\nNow, the paper comes in rolls of 50 cm wide, which is 0.5 meters. The cost is Rs.2 per meter. Wait, perhaps the cost is Rs.2 per meter of the paper's length. So, for each meter of length of the paper, since the width is 0.5m, the area per meter length is 0.5 m\u00b2. So the cost per square meter of the paper would be Rs.2 per meter length divided by 0.5 m\u00b2 per meter length, so 2 / 0.5 = Rs.4 per square meter. Wait, but maybe the question is phrased such that the cost is Rs.2 per meter (of the paper's width?), but I'm getting confused. Let me read again.\n\nThe problem states: \"It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the Rs.2 per meter is the cost per running meter of the paper. Since the paper is 50 cm wide, each meter of length (running meter) would provide 0.5 m\u00b2 of area. So the cost per square meter would be (2 Rupees) / 0.5 m\u00b2 = 4 Rupees per m\u00b2. Alternatively, maybe the cost is Rs.2 per meter of the paper's width? Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost is calculated as follows: The total area required (after subtracting 15) is A. The paper is 50 cm wide, so the length of the paper needed is (A) / 0.5 (since area = width * length \u2192 length = area / width). The cost is (length of paper in meters) multiplied by Rs.2 per meter. So total cost is (A / 0.5) * 2. Let me check:\n\nTotal paper area needed is A = (2*(l + w)*h) - 15.\n\nThe length of the paper required is (A) divided by the width (0.5 m). So length L = A / 0.5 = 2A. The cost is L * 2 Rs/m. So total cost is (2A) * 2 = 4A? Wait that can't be right. Wait let's recalculate.\n\nWait, if the paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m), then the area per meter of length is 0.5 m\u00b2. So if you need A square meters, then the length needed is A / 0.5 = 2A meters. The cost is (2A) * (Rs.2 per meter). So total cost = 2A * 2 = 4A? Wait no. Wait, the cost per meter of the paper's length is Rs.2. So the total cost is (length in meters) * Rs.2. The length needed is (A / 0.5). So total cost is (A / 0.5)*2 = (2A) * 2? Wait no. Wait, (A divided by 0.5) is the length. So (A /0.5) is 2A. Then multiplied by 2 gives 4A. Hmm but that might be. Let me see with numbers. Suppose A is 10 m\u00b2. Then the length needed is 10 /0.5 =20 meters. Cost would be 20 *2 =40. So 4A would be 40. So yes, that works. So total cost is 4*A, where A is the required area (after subtracting 15). But the problem states that the total cost is 260. So 4*A =260 \u2192 A=65. So the required area (total area minus doors/windows) is 65 m\u00b2. So the total wall area is 65 +15 =80 m\u00b2. Wait, total wall area is perimeter * height. Let me write equations.\n\nLet me formalize all variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nh = height of the room.\n\nsemi-perimeter (as given in ratio) is (l + w). Since the ratio is h : (l + w) = 2:5, so h/(l +w) = 2/5 \u2192 (l + w) = (5/2) h.\n\nTotal wall area (without doors/windows) is perimeter * height = 2*(l + w)*h. \n\nThe area to be covered is (2*(l + w)*h) - 15 = 65 (since 65 = total cost /4? Wait earlier calculation says that total cost is 4*A where A is the area to be covered, so if total cost is 260, then 4*A =260 \u2192 A=65. So:\n\n2*(l + w)*h -15 = 65 \u2192 2*(l +w)*h = 80.\n\nBut (l + w) = (5/2)h, so substitute that into the equation:\n\n2*( (5/2)h ) * h = 80 \u2192 2*(5/2 h\u00b2) =80 \u2192 5 h\u00b2 =80 \u2192 h\u00b2 =16 \u2192 h=4 m. \n\nWait, that would give h=4 meters. Which is option C. But let me check again step by step to be sure.\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\n1. The ratio h/(l + w) = 2/5 \u2192 (l + w) = (5/2)h.\n\n2. The total cost is 260. The cost is calculated as ( (Total area to be covered) / (width of paper) ) * cost per meter of paper length. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the cost calculation. \n\nThe area to be covered is A = total wall area - 15. The paper is 0.5 meters wide. To cover A m\u00b2, you need length L such that 0.5 * L = A \u2192 L = A /0.5 = 2A. \n\nThe cost is L * (cost per meter). Since the cost per meter of the paper's length is Rs.2, then total cost is 2 * L = 2*(2A) =4A. So yes, that's correct. So 4A =260 \u2192 A=65. Then total wall area is A +15 =80.\n\nTotal wall area is 2*(l + w)*h =80.\n\nBut (l +w) = (5/2)h, so substituting:\n\n2*(5/2 h)*h = 5h\u00b2 =80 \u2192 h\u00b2 =16 \u2192 h=4 m. So the answer is C)4m.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, option C is 4m. Hmm, but let me check again if I made an error in the equations.\n\nWait, let me check all steps again. \n\nFirst, the ratio: h : semi-perimeter is 2:5. If semi-perimeter is (l +w), then h/(l +w) =2/5. So (l +w) = (5/2)h. Correct.\n\nTotal wall area is 2*(l +w)*h. Correct because each pair of walls has area l*h and w*h, so 2*(l +w)*h.\n\nThen, the area to be covered is that minus 15. So:\n\nTotal area covered: 2*(l +w)*h -15 = A \u2192 and A must equal 65 (since 4A=260). \n\nThus, 2*(l +w)*h =80. \n\nSubstituting (l +w) as (5/2 h):\n\n2*(5/2 h) * h = 5 h\u00b2. \n\nSo 5 h\u00b2 =80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4. \n\nSo that's correct. So the answer is C.\n\nWait, but the options include 4.0m, so that's option C. But let me check the options again. \n\nOptions:\n\nA)2.6m\n\nB)3.9m\n\nC)4m\n\nD)4.2m\n\nE)4.4m\n\nYes, so 4 is option C. Therefore, the answer should be C. \n\nHmm, but I need to make sure there's no mistake in the cost calculation. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the paper is 50 cm wide (0.5 m). So each meter of the paper's length gives 0.5 m\u00b2. The cost per meter of length is Rs.2. So for each square meter of area, you need 2 meters of paper (since 1 m\u00b2 requires 2 meters of 0.5m width paper). So cost per square meter would be 2 * Rs.2 = Rs.4 per m\u00b2. Therefore, the total cost is 4*(area to be covered). So 4*A =260 \u2192 A=65. Which matches the earlier step. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the height is 4 meters, which is option C. \n\nWait, but let me see if any step could have an error. For instance, maybe the semi-perimeter is half the perimeter. Wait, the perimeter is 2(l + w), so semi-perimeter (half of that) would be (l +w). So the ratio h : semi-perimeter is h : (l +w) =2:5. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, all steps seem correct. So the answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem here about the height of a room and the cost to paper the walls. Hmm. The question says the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. Then there's some info about the cost and the paper's width and price, and we have to find the height. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the given data. The ratio of height (let's call that h) to semi-perimeter is 2:5. The semi-perimeter of a room's walls would be half the perimeter of the base, right? Wait, actually, the perimeter of the room's floor (since the walls are around it). The semi-perimeter would be half of that perimeter. Wait, maybe I should think of the perimeter first. Let me clarify.\n\nThe semi-perimeter here probably refers to the sum of length and breadth divided by 2? Or maybe the perimeter of the room's walls? Wait, perimeter of the floor would be 2*(length + breadth), so semi-perimeter would be (length + breadth). Because if you take half the perimeter, that's (length + breadth). So the ratio of height to (length + breadth) is 2:5. So h : (l + b) = 2:5. So h/(l + b) = 2/5. So h = (2/5)(l + b). Got that part.\n\nNext part: It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter. Also, allowing 15 sq.m for doors and windows. So the cost is for the area of the walls minus the 15 sq.m. \n\nWait, papering the walls: the area to be covered is the total wall area minus the area for doors and windows. The total wall area would be the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height. Because each wall's area is height multiplied by length or breadth, so adding all four walls gives 2*(l + b)*h. Which is perimeter (since 2*(l + b)) times height. So the total area is perimeter * h. But then subtract 15 for doors and windows. \n\nSo the cost is calculated based on the area to be papered. The cost per meter of the paper is given, but the paper's width is 50cm. Hmm, so maybe I need to calculate the total area first, then find how much paper is needed, considering the width, then multiply by the cost per meter?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cost is calculated as (Area - 15) * cost per square meter? Wait, the problem says \"at Rs.2 per meter\". Wait, maybe I need to read that part again.\n\nThe problem states: \"costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.\" \n\nHmm, the wording is a bit tricky. Let me parse it again. The cost is for the paper, which is priced at Rs.2 per meter. Since the paper is 50 cm wide, each meter of paper (in length) would cover an area of 0.5 meters (since 50cm is 0.5m) times 1 meter (length). Wait, no, the width is 50cm. So the area per meter length of the paper is 0.5 m * 1m (per meter of length) so 0.5 m\u00b2 per meter of paper. \n\nAlternatively, the cost is given per meter of the paper's length, so each meter of paper (which is 0.5 m wide) would cost Rs.2. Therefore, the total cost is the total length of paper needed multiplied by Rs.2 per meter. \n\nThe total area of the walls minus the 15 sq.m is equal to the area of the paper used. Let me structure this:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nTotal wall area = 2*(l + b)*h (since all four walls have area: two walls of l*h and two of b*h). \n\nThe area to be papered is total wall area minus 15. So that area must equal the area of the paper used. \n\nThe paper comes in rolls of 50 cm width. Let\u2019s denote the length of the paper needed as L meters. Then the area of the paper is L * 0.5 m\u00b2 (since 50 cm is 0.5 m). \n\nSo:\n\nArea to be papered = (Total wall area - 15) = L * 0.5.\n\nThe cost is then L * (Rs.2 per meter). \n\nGiven that the total cost is Rs.260, so:\n\n2 * L = 260 \u2192 L = 260 / 2 = 130 meters. \n\nTherefore, the area of the paper is 130 * 0.5 = 65 m\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n2*(l + b)*h - 15 = 65 \n\nSo 2*(l + b)*h = 80 \n\nHmm, okay. Now, from the ratio given, h/(l + b) = 2/5 \u2192 (l + b) = (5/2)*h \n\nSubstituting into the equation above:\n\n2*( (5/2)*h ) * h = 80 \n\nLet me compute that:\n\n2*(5/2 h) * h \u2192 The 2 and the denominator 2 cancel, so 5h * h \u2192 5h\u00b2 \n\nSo 5h\u00b2 = 80 \u2192 h\u00b2 = 16 \u2192 h = 4 meters? \n\nWait, that would be answer C)4m. But let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait let's go through the equations again:\n\nWe have:\n\nTotal wall area: 2*(l + b)*h \n\nSubtract 15 gives the area to be covered, which is equal to the paper's area (L * 0.5). The cost is L * 2 = 260 \u2192 L=130. So paper area is 130 *0.5 =65. \n\nThus:\n\n2*(l + b)*h -15 =65 \u2192 2*(l + b)*h = 80 \u2192 (l +b)*h =40 \n\nBut from the ratio h/(l +b)=2/5 \u2192 (l +b)= (5h)/2 \n\nSubstituting into (l +b)*h =40 \u2192 (5h/2)*h =40 \u2192 (5h\u00b2)/2 =40 \u2192 5h\u00b2 =80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4. \n\nYes, so 4 meters. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are A)2.6, B)3.9, C)4, D)4.2, E)4.4. So C is 4, so that's the answer. \n\nHmm, but let me think again. Did I mix up the semi-perimeter correctly? The ratio is height to semi-perimeter. The semi-perimeter here is (l + b), since the perimeter is 2(l +b), so semi-perimeter is half that, which would be (l +b). Wait no, wait. Wait, semi-perimeter usually is half the perimeter, so the perimeter is 2(l + b), so semi-perimeter would be (l + b). So the ratio h : (semi-perimeter) is h : (l + b) = 2:5. So yes, that part is correct. \n\nTherefore, the calculations are correct, and the answer should be C)4m. \n\nWait, but let me check once more the cost calculation. The paper is 50cm wide, so each meter of paper (length) is 0.5 m\u00b2. The cost is Rs.2 per meter (per meter length). So for L meters of paper, cost is 2*L, and area is 0.5*L. \n\nSo total cost is 2*L =260 \u2192 L=130. Area is 0.5*130=65. So 65 = (Total walls -15). So total walls area is 65 +15 =80. \n\nThen, total walls area is 2*(l +b)*h =80. \n\nWhich is same as before. \n\nThen substituting (l +b) = (5h)/2. \n\nSo 2*(5h/2)*h = 5h\u00b2 =80 \u2192 h\u00b2=16 \u2192 h=4. \n\nYep, that's correct. So the answer is C.\n",
