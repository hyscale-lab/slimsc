      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the diameter of the sphere that inscribes a rectangular solid with dimensions 3x4x15. Hmm, right. Let me think. When a rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, all its vertices lie on the sphere's surface. The key here is that the sphere's diameter must be equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid. Because the longest distance between any two vertices of the solid would be its space diagonal, right? So the diameter of the sphere has to be exactly that diagonal length.\n\nWait, so the formula for the space diagonal of a rectangular prism is sqrt(length\u00b2 + width\u00b2 + height\u00b2). Let me confirm that. Yeah, I remember from the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. So for a box with sides a, b, c, the space diagonal d is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). \n\nSo plugging in the given dimensions here: 3, 4, and 15. Let me compute each term. \n\nFirst, 3 squared is 9, then 4 squared is 16, and 15 squared is 225. Adding those together: 9 + 16 = 25, and 25 + 225 = 250. So the space diagonal would be sqrt(250). \n\nCalculating sqrt(250). Well, sqrt(250) can be simplified as sqrt(25*10) which is 5*sqrt(10). Since sqrt(10) is approximately 3.1623, multiplying by 5 gives 5 * 3.1623 \u2248 15.8115. Hmm, so that would be the diagonal. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 15.8113. That's really close. Wait, but let me check my calculations again to be sure. \n\n3 squared is definitely 9, 4 squared is 16, and 15 squared is 225. Adding those gives 9 +16 =25, plus 225 gives 250. The square root of 250 is indeed 5 times sqrt(10), which is approximately 15.8113. So the diameter should be exactly that, so the answer must be B. \n\nWait a second, but the problem says the sphere is inscribed, so the diameter equals the space diagonal. That makes sense because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices, so the sphere must have a diameter at least that long to contain the solid. Since all vertices are on the sphere, the diagonal must equal the diameter. \n\nSo yeah, I think B is the right answer here. Let me check the options again. The options are A) 13.3542, B) 15.8113, C) 18.3451, D) 19.5667, E) 20.8888. Yep, B matches exactly with the calculation. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So the answer must be B.\n",
