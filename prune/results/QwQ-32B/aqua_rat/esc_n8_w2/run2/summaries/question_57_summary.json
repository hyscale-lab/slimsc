      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow with a size of 5cm. The thickness is 1cm. Since it's made of 1cm cubes, each small cube is 1x1x1. The question is about the number of faces on these small cubes that are unpainted after the outer surface is painted.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. The main cube is hollow. So, the structure isn't a solid cube. The thickness is 1cm, which probably means that the walls of the hollow cube are 1cm thick. Since the total size is 5cm on each edge, the hollow part inside must be smaller. Let me visualize this. \n\nA solid cube of 5cm would have 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes. But since it's hollow with 1cm thickness, the hollow part would be a cube of (5 - 2*1) cm on each side? Because the thickness is on both sides. So the inner hollow space would be 3cm on each edge (since 5 - 2*1 =3). So the hollow cube is like a frame. The structure is made by removing a 3x3x3 cube from the center of a 5x5x5 cube, right? Wait, but maybe the hollow part is just the inside, so the actual structure is the outer layer of 1cm thick. So the total number of small cubes used would be the total of the solid 5x5x5 minus the hollow part (which is 3x3x3). Let me check that: 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98. So there are 98 small cubes in the hollow structure.\n\nBut the question isn't about the number of cubes, but the number of unpainted faces on all the small cubes. Hmm. Wait, when the outer surface is painted, the outer faces of the entire structure are painted. The inner surfaces (the hollow part) would be unpainted. But each small cube's faces that are on the inside of the hollow cube would also be unpainted. So perhaps we need to calculate all the faces of all the small cubes, subtract the ones that are painted (the outer surface), and then the remaining would be the unpainted ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of each face of the small cubes. Let's see.\n\nFirst, total number of small cubes: 98 as above. Each small cube has 6 faces. So total faces: 98 *6 = 588. But this counts all faces, including those glued to adjacent cubes. However, the problem might be asking about the total number of faces that are unpainted, regardless of whether they are part of the structure's interior or not. Wait, but the question says, \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted\". The outer surface is painted, so any face that's on the outside of the hollow cube is painted. The inner faces (those adjacent to the hollow space) and the faces between the small cubes (which are internal) would be unpainted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each face of the small cube that is on the exterior (part of the outer surface) is painted, and the rest are not. So the total number of painted faces is equal to the surface area of the hollow cube's exterior. Then the unpainted would be total faces (all small cube faces) minus the painted ones.\n\nWait, maybe that's the way. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, compute the total number of faces of all the small cubes. Each small cube has 6 faces. So 98 cubes *6 = 588 total faces.\n\nNow, the painted faces are those on the outer surface of the hollow cube. The hollow cube's outer surface is a 5cm cube. Wait, but since it's hollow, the outer surface is the same as the surface of a solid cube of 5cm, right? Because the thickness is 1cm, so the outer surface is the entire outer layer. So the surface area of the outer cube would be 6*(5^2) = 150. Each face of the cube has 25 (5x5) small faces, so 6*25 = 150. So the total painted faces would be 150. But wait, but some of the small cubes' faces might be on the inner side, so their adjacent faces would be part of the hollow space. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when considering the hollow cube, some of the small cubes are on edges or corners, so their faces may be on the outside but also adjacent to the hollow space. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total painted faces are exactly the surface area of the outer cube, which is 150. So then the unpainted faces would be total faces (588) minus the painted ones (150). But 588-150=438. But that would give 438, which is option A. But I'm not sure if this is correct, because some of the small cubes have faces that are internal (like between the walls) and those would also be unpainted, so perhaps the total unpainted is more than that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because when considering the hollow cube, the inner surfaces (the hollow part) are also not painted. So the total painted is only the outer surface (150), but the inner surfaces (the surfaces facing the hollow part) are also unpainted, so those should be added. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nLet me think again. Let's approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, the hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5cm, with a thickness of 1cm. Therefore, the inner dimension (the hollow space) is 5 - 2*1 = 3cm on each edge. So the hollow space is a 3x3x3 cube. The structure is the outer layer of 1cm thickness, so the volume is (5^3 - 3^3)= 125-27=98 small cubes as before.\n\nEach of the small cubes in the structure can be categorized based on their position. For example, some are on the corners, edges, faces, or edges of the hollow structure. But maybe it's better to compute the total number of painted faces first.\n\nThe outer surface area is 6*(5x5) = 150 small faces (each face of the big cube has 25 small faces, so total 6*25=150). These are all painted. \n\nAdditionally, the inner surface (the hollow part) also has a surface area. The inner hollow is a 3x3x3 cube, so its surface area is 6*(3x3) =54. However, since the hollow is inside the structure, the inner surfaces are part of the small cubes' faces. So the inner surfaces are also made up of small cube faces, but those are not painted. Therefore, those 54 small faces on the inner surface would also be unpainted. Wait, but do these inner surfaces count towards the total?\n\nWait, the problem states that the outer surface is painted. The inner surfaces are not painted, so their faces are unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be the inner surface (54) plus all the other faces (the ones that are not on the outer or inner surfaces, i.e., the faces between the small cubes). Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of faces on all small cubes is 98*6 = 588. The painted faces are the outer surface's 150. The inner surfaces (the hollow's surface) are 54, which are also part of the small cubes' faces but are not painted. The remaining faces (588 -150 -54) would be the ones between the small cubes, which are internal and thus not painted either. Wait, but the question is asking for the number of faces that remain unpainted. So all the unpainted faces would be 588 - 150 = 438. But that would ignore the inner surface. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the inner surface is part of the structure's walls. So each face on the inner side of the hollow cube is part of a small cube's face. Since those inner faces are not painted, they should be counted as unpainted. The outer surface's 150 are painted. The inner surface's 54 are unpainted. The remaining faces (the ones between the cubes) are also unpainted. So total unpainted would be 588 -150 = 438. Wait, but the inner surface's 54 are part of the total 588. So subtracting the painted 150 gives all the unpainted, which includes inner and internal.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct. Because when you subtract all the painted faces (outer surface), the rest are unpainted. The inner surfaces and internal faces between small cubes are all unpainted, so the total is indeed 588 -150 =438. That would be option A. But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner surface is considered as part of the structure's interior. Let me think again. Let me think of a single face of the hollow cube. The outer face has 25 small cube faces (painted). The inner face (the hollow side) of that wall has 3x3 =9 small cube faces (since the hollow is 3x3x3). So each of the 6 outer faces has a corresponding inner face. So the inner surface area is 6*(3x3) =54, which are all unpainted. So those 54 are part of the total small cube faces. So the total painted is 150 (the outer surface), and the total unpainted is 54 (inner surface) plus the internal faces between the small cubes. Wait, but the internal faces between the small cubes are the ones that are not on any surface. For example, two adjacent small cubes in the structure would have a face glued together, so those are internal and not painted. So how do we calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of faces on all small cubes is 98*6 =588. The painted ones are 150 (outer surface). The rest (588-150=438) would include both the inner surfaces and the internal faces between cubes. So the problem says \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted\", so that total is correct, 438, so the answer is A. But wait, the options include 438 as option A and 498 as E. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the inner surfaces are part of the small cubes' faces but are not counted in the outer surface. Let me try another approach. Let me calculate the number of unpainted faces.\n\nEach small cube can have 0 to 6 painted faces, depending on their position. The total unpainted faces are the sum over all small cubes of (6 - number of painted faces per cube). So perhaps it's better to calculate for each cube how many of their faces are painted, then sum that up, subtract from total faces (588) to get the unpainted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking down into different types of cubes.\n\nIn the hollow cube structure, the small cubes can be categorized based on their position:\n\n1. Corner cubes: Each corner of the hollow cube is part of the structure. Since it's a 5cm cube, each corner is a small cube at the corner. Since the cube is hollow, the corner cubes are part of the outer layer. Each corner cube has three faces exposed (the outer surfaces). However, since the structure is hollow, the inner face (the one towards the hollow) would be adjacent to nothing? Wait, no. Let me think. The hollow is inside. The corner cube is part of the outer layer, so the inner faces (the ones facing the hollow) would be part of the inner surface. For example, a corner cube would have three outer faces (on the three outer surfaces meeting at the corner), and the other three faces: one is adjacent to another cube in the structure, and two are part of the inner walls. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the corner cube. Let's imagine the cube at the corner (0,0,0) if the cube is from (0 to 5). Wait, maybe coordinate system is complicating. Alternatively, each corner cube is part of three outer faces, so those three are painted. The remaining three faces of the corner cube: one is adjacent to another cube (so internal), and the other two are part of the inner walls. Wait, perhaps in the hollow cube, the corner cube's inner faces (the ones not on the outer surface) are part of the inner walls. For example, a corner cube would have three outer painted faces, and the other three faces: two are part of the inner surfaces (the hollow walls), and one is adjacent to another cube in the structure (so not painted). Wait, maybe it's better to think that each cube on the edge or corner would have some of their faces exposed to the hollow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the entire structure as the outer layer (1cm thick) of a 5cm cube. So the cubes in the structure can be on the faces, edges, or corners of the outer cube. Wait, but the structure is hollow, so the inner part is empty. So the structure's cubes are only on the outer 1cm layer. So similar to a solid cube's outer layer. So perhaps the number of painted faces can be calculated as the surface area of the outer cube, which is 6*(5)^2=150. Thus, the total painted faces are 150, so the unpainted are total faces (588) minus 150 = 438. That would be answer A. But the options include 438 as A, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the inner surfaces (the hollow) are also part of the small cubes' faces. Let me see. The hollow's inner surface is made up of the inner faces of the structure's cubes. For example, in the center, the hollow is 3x3x3. Each face of the hollow is made up of 3x3 small cubes' inner faces. So each of those inner faces (54 in total) are part of the small cubes, but are not painted. So these 54 are unpainted. The total unpainted would be the inner faces (54) plus all the internal faces between small cubes (the ones that are glued to each other). The total unpainted would be 54 plus (total internal faces between cubes). \n\nWait, the total internal faces between cubes can be calculated as follows: each cube has some adjacent cubes. The total number of adjacent face pairs between cubes is (number of edges in the structure). But maybe a better way is to compute the total faces minus the outer and inner surfaces. Alternatively, the total number of internal faces (both between cubes and on the inner surface) is total small cube faces (588) minus the outer painted (150) minus the inner surface (54). So 588 -150 -54 = 384. Then the total unpainted is 54 (inner) plus 384 (internal between cubes) = 438? Wait, no, that would be 54 + (588-150-54) = 588 -150=438. So that's the same as before. So yes, the total unpainted is 438, which would be answer A. But I need to check the options again. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498.\n\nHmm, but maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the inner surface is not 54. Let me recalculate the inner surface area. The hollow is 3x3x3, so each face of the hollow is 3x3, so 9 per face, 6 faces gives 54. So that's correct. So the inner surfaces are 54, which are part of the small cubes' faces and are unpainted. The outer is 150 painted. The remaining are internal between the cubes. So the total unpainted is 54 + (total internal) ?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be considering that the inner surfaces are part of the structure's interior and thus their faces are not considered as part of the cube's exterior, but they are still faces of the small cubes. So all those faces except the outer ones are unpainted. Therefore, the total unpainted is indeed total faces (588) minus painted (150) =438. \n\nBut wait, the options have 498 as E. That's close to 500. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of small cubes. Let me check that again. The hollow cube is 5cm, thickness 1cm. So the inner hollow is 3cm. So the structure is the difference between 5^3 and 3^3. So 125-27=98. So that's correct. 98 small cubes. 98x6=588. So that part is right. 588-150=438. Hmm. But why is 498 an option? Let me see what 500-2=498. Maybe there's an error in my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner surface is not 54. Let me think again. The hollow is a 3x3x3 cube. But the structure's inner walls are 1cm thick. Wait, maybe the inner surface is different? Wait, the hollow is inside the 5cm cube. The thickness of the walls is 1cm, so the inner dimensions are 5-2*1=3. So yes, the hollow is 3x3x3. The inner surface area would be 6*(3)^2 =54. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts the inner faces as part of the outer surface? No, the question says the outer surface is painted. The inner is not. So perhaps the answer is A)438. But let me think of another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the inner surfaces as part of the small cubes. For example, the inner surface faces are not part of the cube's exterior, but the small cubes have those faces adjacent to the hollow. So those faces are not painted but are part of the small cubes. So they should be counted as unpainted. So the total unpainted is indeed 588 -150 =438. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option E)498? Let me see: 500-2 is 498. Maybe I'm missing the edges or corners? Let me think of a different approach. Let's think of each face of the hollow cube. The outer surface has 5x5 =25 squares per face, so 6*25=150. The inner surface has 3x3=9 per face, so 6*9=54. So total painted is 150, inner is 54. The total small cube faces are 98*6=588. So unpainted is 588-150=438. So that's correct. So the answer should be A)438. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of small cubes. Let me recalculate the number of small cubes in the hollow structure again. The hollow cube is 5cm, with walls 1cm thick. So the structure is like a frame. The total volume is 5^3 - (5-2)^3 =125-27=98. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of small cubes with unpainted faces, but that's not what the question says. The question is about the number of faces. \n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that when you have the hollow cube, the inner faces are part of the small cubes but are not considered because they are adjacent to air (the hollow). So those faces are indeed unpainted. So the calculation seems right. So I think the answer is A)438. \n\nWait, but let me see another way. Let's consider each small cube and count their unpainted faces. \n\nLet me categorize the small cubes based on their positions:\n\n1. Corner cubes: There are 8 corners on the hollow cube. Each corner cube is part of three outer faces (so three painted faces). The other three faces: two are part of the inner walls (so unpainted), and one is adjacent to another cube (so internal, unpainted). So each corner cube has 3 painted and 3 unpainted faces. \n\nEach corner cube contributes 3 unpainted. 8 cubes *3 =24.\n\n2. Edge cubes (not corners): The edges of the hollow cube. Each edge of the cube has length 5cm, but since it's a hollow structure with 1cm thickness, the edge has small cubes along it. Wait, but the edge is part of the outer surface. Let's think of an edge. Each edge of the cube (there are 12 edges) has 5 small cubes along it. But since it's the edge of the hollow cube, the first and last are the corners. So excluding the corners, each edge has 5-2=3 cubes. \n\nEach of these edge cubes (not corners) is on the edge of the outer cube, so they have two outer faces painted. The third outer face is along the edge. Wait, no. Wait, along an edge, each cube on the edge (but not a corner) has two painted faces (the two adjacent outer faces). The remaining four faces: one is along the edge towards the corner (but adjacent to another cube?), and the other three? Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of each edge cube (non-corner):\n\nTake an edge between two corners. For example, on the top front edge. Each cube on this edge (excluding corners) is part of two outer faces (front and top, say). So two painted faces. The other four faces: one is towards the adjacent cube along the edge (so internal), two are part of the inner surfaces (the sides facing the hollow), and one is the bottom face (if it's on the top edge, then maybe another direction). Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that each edge cube (non-corner) has two painted faces and the remaining four faces: one is adjacent to another cube (so internal), and three are on the inner surfaces. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of a specific example. Let's take an edge cube on the top edge of the cube's front face. The cube is part of the front face (painted) and the top face (painted). The third outer face would be the side (left or right, depending on the edge). Wait, no, each edge is where two faces meet. So a cube on the edge (not corner) has two painted faces. The remaining four faces: one is adjacent to another cube along the edge (so internal), and the other three are part of the inner walls. Wait, perhaps two of them are inner walls and one is adjacent to another cube. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's easier to count the number of painted faces per cube and proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate for each cube type:\n\nCorners: 8 cubes, each with 3 painted faces. So total painted from corners: 8*3=24.\n\nEdges (non-corner): Each edge has (length -2) cubes. Since each edge of the big cube is 5 units, so per edge, non-corner cubes:5-2=3. There are 12 edges. So 12*3=36 edge cubes. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces. So total painted from edges: 36*2=72.\n\nFaces (non-edge, non-corner): Each face of the cube has (5-2)*(5-2) =3*3=9 cubes. But since it's the outer layer, the face is part of the 5x5. Wait, the face of the hollow cube's outer surface: each face has 5x5=25 cubes. Subtract the edges and corners. Each face has 4 edges (each edge has 5 cubes, but corners are counted twice). So per face: 4 edges, each contributing (5-2) non-corner edge cubes. Wait, perhaps better to compute: each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=9 inner cubes (non-edge, non-corner). So per face: 9. There are 6 faces, so 6*9=54 face centers. Each of these has 1 painted face (the outer face), the rest are inner or adjacent. So each contributes 1 painted face. So total from face centers:54*1=54.\n\nThen the remaining cubes are the ones inside the structure but not on the faces, edges, or corners. Wait, but the structure is only 1cm thick. So the structure is the outer layer. So all cubes are on the outer layer. Therefore, there are no cubes inside the structure except those on the surfaces. Wait, the structure is 1cm thick, so the cubes are only on the outer surfaces. Therefore, all cubes are either corners, edges, or face centers. So total cubes: 8+36+54=98. Which matches the earlier count. \n\nSo total painted faces: 24 (corners) +72 (edges) +54 (face centers) = 150. Which matches the surface area calculation. \n\nTherefore, the total painted faces are 150, so the total unpainted is total faces (588) minus 150 =438. So the answer should be A)438.\n\nBut the options include E)498. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes? Wait, let me check again. The structure is 5^3 -3^3 =125-27=98. So that's correct. Each small cube has 6 faces. So 98*6=588. Yes. So 588-150=438. So the answer must be A. So why is there an option E?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says: \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\".\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when considering the inner surfaces (the hollow part's walls), those faces are part of the small cubes but are not painted. So those are counted in the unpainted. But also, the faces between the small cubes (the ones glued to each other) are also unpainted. So total unpainted is indeed (total faces) - (painted faces) =588-150=438. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed that some of the inner surfaces are counted as part of the outer structure? Or maybe the question considers that the inner surface is painted? No, the problem states the outer surface is painted. The inner is not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not hollow? Wait, no, the question says it's a hollow cube with thickness 1cm. So my approach seems correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is E)498? Let me see what 588 - 90=498. Where would 90 come from? Wait, maybe I miscalculated the painted faces. Let me recalculate the painted faces again using the cube types:\n\nCorners:8*3=24\n\nEdges:12 edges, each with 3 non-corner cubes (since 5-2=3), so 12*3=36. Each has 2 painted: 36*2=72. Total so far:24+72=96.\n\nFaces: each face has (5-2)^2=9 face centers. 6 faces:54. Each has 1 painted face:54. So total painted:96+54=150. So correct.\n\nHmm, so the calculation is right. Then the answer must be A)438. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)438\n\nB)550\n\nC)500\n\nD)450\n\nE)498\n\nSo 438 is there. So the correct answer should be A. Maybe the options are correct, so I think I'm right.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface of the hollow cube is painted. Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the cube is hollow with a size of 5cm. The thickness is 1cm. Since it's made of 1cm cubes, each small cube is 1x1x1. The question is about the number of faces on these small cubes that are unpainted after the outer surface is painted.\n\nHmm, let me break this down. The main cube is hollow. So, the structure isn't a solid cube. The thickness is 1cm, which probably means that the walls of the hollow cube are 1cm thick. Since the total size is 5cm on each edge, the hollow part inside must be smaller. Let me visualize this. \n\nA solid cube of 5cm would have 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes. But since it's hollow with 1cm thickness, the hollow part would be a cube of (5 - 2*1) cm on each side? Because the thickness is on both sides. So the inner hollow space would be 3cm on each edge (since 5 - 2*1 =3). So the hollow cube is like a frame. The structure is made by removing a 3x3x3 cube from the center of a 5x5x5 cube, right? Wait, but maybe the hollow part is just the inside, so the actual structure is the outer layer of 1cm thick. So the total number of small cubes used would be the total of the solid 5x5x5 minus the hollow part (which is 3x3x3). Let me check that: 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98. So there are 98 small cubes in the hollow structure.\n\nBut the question isn't about the number of cubes, but the number of unpainted faces on all the small cubes. Hmm. Wait, when the outer surface is painted, the outer faces of the entire structure are painted. The inner surfaces (the hollow part) would be unpainted. But each small cube's faces that are on the inside of the hollow cube would also be unpainted. So perhaps we need to calculate all the faces of all the small cubes, subtract the ones that are painted (the outer surface), and then the remaining would be the unpainted ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of each face of the small cubes. Let's see.\n\nFirst, total number of small cubes: 98 as above. Each small cube has 6 faces. So total faces: 98 *6 = 588. But this counts all faces, including those glued to adjacent cubes. However, the problem might be asking about the total number of faces that are unpainted, regardless of whether they are part of the structure's interior or not. Wait, but the question says, \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted\". The outer surface is painted, so any face that's on the outside of the hollow cube is painted. The inner faces (those adjacent to the hollow space) and the faces between the small cubes (which are internal) would be unpainted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that each face of the small cube that is on the exterior (part of the outer surface) is painted, and the rest are not. So the total number of painted faces is equal to the surface area of the hollow cube's exterior. Then the unpainted would be total faces (all small cube faces) minus the painted ones.\n\nWait, maybe that's the way. Let me try that approach.\n\nFirst, compute the total number of faces of all the small cubes. Each small cube has 6 faces. So 98 cubes *6 = 588 total faces.\n\nNow, the painted faces are those on the outer surface of the hollow cube. The hollow cube's outer surface is a 5cm cube. Wait, but since it's hollow, the outer surface is the same as the surface of a solid cube of 5cm, right? Because the thickness is 1cm, so the outer surface is the entire outer layer. So the surface area of the outer cube would be 6*(5^2) = 150. Each face of the cube has 25 (5x5) small faces, so 6*25 = 150. So the total painted faces would be 150. But wait, but some of the small cubes' faces might be on the inner side, so their adjacent faces would be part of the hollow space. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when considering the hollow cube, some of the small cubes are on edges or corners, so their faces may be on the outside but also adjacent to the hollow space. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total painted faces are exactly the surface area of the outer cube, which is 150. So then the unpainted faces would be total faces (588) minus the painted ones (150). But 588-150=438. But that would give 438, which is option A. But I'm not sure if this is correct, because some of the small cubes have faces that are internal (like between the walls) and those would also be unpainted, so perhaps the total unpainted is more than that.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Because when considering the hollow cube, the inner surfaces (the hollow part) are also not painted. So the total painted is only the outer surface (150), but the inner surfaces (the surfaces facing the hollow part) are also unpainted, so those should be added. Hmm, that complicates things.\n\nLet me think again. Let's approach it step by step.\n\nFirst, the hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5cm, with a thickness of 1cm. Therefore, the inner dimension (the hollow space) is 5 - 2*1 = 3cm on each edge. So the hollow space is a 3x3x3 cube. The structure is the outer layer of 1cm thickness, so the volume is (5^3 - 3^3)= 125-27=98 small cubes as before.\n\nEach of the small cubes in the structure can be categorized based on their position. For example, some are on the corners, edges, faces, or edges of the hollow structure. But maybe it's better to compute the total number of painted faces first.\n\nThe outer surface area is 6*(5x5) = 150 small faces (each face of the big cube has 25 small faces, so total 6*25=150). These are all painted. \n\nAdditionally, the inner surface (the hollow part) also has a surface area. The inner hollow is a 3x3x3 cube, so its surface area is 6*(3x3) =54. However, since the hollow is inside the structure, the inner surfaces are part of the small cubes' faces. So the inner surfaces are also made up of small cube faces, but those are not painted. Therefore, those 54 small faces on the inner surface would also be unpainted. Wait, but do these inner surfaces count towards the total?\n\nWait, the problem states that the outer surface is painted. The inner surfaces are not painted, so their faces are unpainted. So the total unpainted faces would be the inner surface (54) plus all the other faces (the ones that are not on the outer or inner surfaces, i.e., the faces between the small cubes). Wait, but maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of faces on all small cubes is 98*6 = 588. The painted faces are the outer surface's 150. The inner surfaces (the hollow's surface) are 54, which are also part of the small cubes' faces but are not painted. The remaining faces (588 -150 -54) would be the ones between the small cubes, which are internal and thus not painted either. Wait, but the question is asking for the number of faces that remain unpainted. So all the unpainted faces would be 588 - 150 = 438. But that would ignore the inner surface. Hmm, maybe I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the inner surface is part of the structure's walls. So each face on the inner side of the hollow cube is part of a small cube's face. Since those inner faces are not painted, they should be counted as unpainted. The outer surface's 150 are painted. The inner surface's 54 are unpainted. The remaining faces (the ones between the cubes) are also unpainted. So total unpainted would be 588 -150 = 438. Wait, but the inner surface's 54 are part of the total 588. So subtracting the painted 150 gives all the unpainted, which includes inner and internal.\n\nWait, perhaps that's correct. Because when you subtract all the painted faces (outer surface), the rest are unpainted. The inner surfaces and internal faces between small cubes are all unpainted, so the total is indeed 588 -150 =438. That would be option A. But I need to check if that's the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner surface is considered as part of the structure's interior. Let me think again. Let me think of a single face of the hollow cube. The outer face has 25 small cube faces (painted). The inner face (the hollow side) of that wall has 3x3 =9 small cube faces (since the hollow is 3x3x3). So each of the 6 outer faces has a corresponding inner face. So the inner surface area is 6*(3x3) =54, which are all unpainted. So those 54 are part of the total small cube faces. So the total painted is 150 (the outer surface), and the total unpainted is 54 (inner surface) plus the internal faces between the small cubes. Wait, but the internal faces between the small cubes are the ones that are not on any surface. For example, two adjacent small cubes in the structure would have a face glued together, so those are internal and not painted. So how do we calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the total number of faces on all small cubes is 98*6 =588. The painted ones are 150 (outer surface). The rest (588-150=438) would include both the inner surfaces and the internal faces between cubes. So the problem says \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted\", so that total is correct, 438, so the answer is A. But wait, the options include 438 as option A and 498 as E. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. Maybe the inner surfaces are part of the small cubes' faces but are not counted in the outer surface. Let me try another approach. Let me calculate the number of unpainted faces.\n\nEach small cube can have 0 to 6 painted faces, depending on their position. The total unpainted faces are the sum over all small cubes of (6 - number of painted faces per cube). So perhaps it's better to calculate for each cube how many of their faces are painted, then sum that up, subtract from total faces (588) to get the unpainted.\n\nAlternatively, maybe breaking down into different types of cubes.\n\nIn the hollow cube structure, the small cubes can be categorized based on their position:\n\n1. Corner cubes: Each corner of the hollow cube is part of the structure. Since it's a 5cm cube, each corner is a small cube at the corner. Since the cube is hollow, the corner cubes are part of the outer layer. Each corner cube has three faces exposed (the outer surfaces). However, since the structure is hollow, the inner face (the one towards the hollow) would be adjacent to nothing? Wait, no. Let me think. The hollow is inside. The corner cube is part of the outer layer, so the inner faces (the ones facing the hollow) would be part of the inner surface. For example, a corner cube would have three outer faces (on the three outer surfaces meeting at the corner), and the other three faces: one is adjacent to another cube in the structure, and two are part of the inner walls. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the corner cube. Let's imagine the cube at the corner (0,0,0) if the cube is from (0 to 5). Wait, maybe coordinate system is complicating. Alternatively, each corner cube is part of three outer faces, so those three are painted. The remaining three faces of the corner cube: one is adjacent to another cube (so internal), and the other two are part of the inner walls. Wait, perhaps in the hollow cube, the corner cube's inner faces (the ones not on the outer surface) are part of the inner walls. For example, a corner cube would have three outer painted faces, and the other three faces: two are part of the inner surfaces (the hollow walls), and one is adjacent to another cube in the structure (so not painted). Wait, maybe it's better to think that each cube on the edge or corner would have some of their faces exposed to the hollow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the entire structure as the outer layer (1cm thick) of a 5cm cube. So the cubes in the structure can be on the faces, edges, or corners of the outer cube. Wait, but the structure is hollow, so the inner part is empty. So the structure's cubes are only on the outer 1cm layer. So similar to a solid cube's outer layer. So perhaps the number of painted faces can be calculated as the surface area of the outer cube, which is 6*(5)^2=150. Thus, the total painted faces are 150, so the unpainted are total faces (588) minus 150 = 438. That would be answer A. But the options include 438 as A, but I'm not sure if that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the inner surfaces (the hollow) are also part of the small cubes' faces. Let me see. The hollow's inner surface is made up of the inner faces of the structure's cubes. For example, in the center, the hollow is 3x3x3. Each face of the hollow is made up of 3x3 small cubes' inner faces. So each of those inner faces (54 in total) are part of the small cubes, but are not painted. So these 54 are unpainted. The total unpainted would be the inner faces (54) plus all the internal faces between small cubes (the ones that are glued to each other). The total unpainted would be 54 plus (total internal faces between cubes). \n\nWait, the total internal faces between cubes can be calculated as follows: each cube has some adjacent cubes. The total number of adjacent face pairs between cubes is (number of edges in the structure). But maybe a better way is to compute the total faces minus the outer and inner surfaces. Alternatively, the total number of internal faces (both between cubes and on the inner surface) is total small cube faces (588) minus the outer painted (150) minus the inner surface (54). So 588 -150 -54 = 384. Then the total unpainted is 54 (inner) plus 384 (internal between cubes) = 438? Wait, no, that would be 54 + (588-150-54) = 588 -150=438. So that's the same as before. So yes, the total unpainted is 438, which would be answer A. But I need to check the options again. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498.\n\nHmm, but maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the inner surface is not 54. Let me recalculate the inner surface area. The hollow is 3x3x3, so each face of the hollow is 3x3, so 9 per face, 6 faces gives 54. So that's correct. So the inner surfaces are 54, which are part of the small cubes' faces and are unpainted. The outer is 150 painted. The remaining are internal between the cubes. So the total unpainted is 54 + (total internal) ?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be considering that the inner surfaces are part of the structure's interior and thus their faces are not considered as part of the cube's exterior, but they are still faces of the small cubes. So all those faces except the outer ones are unpainted. Therefore, the total unpainted is indeed total faces (588) minus painted (150) =438. \n\nBut wait, the options have 498 as E. That's close to 500. Maybe I made a mistake in the number of small cubes. Let me check that again. The hollow cube is 5cm, thickness 1cm. So the inner hollow is 3cm. So the structure is the difference between 5^3 and 3^3. So 125-27=98. So that's correct. 98 small cubes. 98x6=588. So that part is right. 588-150=438. Hmm. But why is 498 an option? Let me see what 500-2=498. Maybe there's an error in my calculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the inner surface is not 54. Let me think again. The hollow is a 3x3x3 cube. But the structure's inner walls are 1cm thick. Wait, maybe the inner surface is different? Wait, the hollow is inside the 5cm cube. The thickness of the walls is 1cm, so the inner dimensions are 5-2*1=3. So yes, the hollow is 3x3x3. The inner surface area would be 6*(3)^2 =54. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem counts the inner faces as part of the outer surface? No, the question says the outer surface is painted. The inner is not. So perhaps the answer is A)438. But let me think of another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not considering the inner surfaces as part of the small cubes. For example, the inner surface faces are not part of the cube's exterior, but the small cubes have those faces adjacent to the hollow. So those faces are not painted but are part of the small cubes. So they should be counted as unpainted. So the total unpainted is indeed 588 -150 =438. \n\nHmm, but why is there an option E)498? Let me see: 500-2 is 498. Maybe I'm missing the edges or corners? Let me think of a different approach. Let's think of each face of the hollow cube. The outer surface has 5x5 =25 squares per face, so 6*25=150. The inner surface has 3x3=9 per face, so 6*9=54. So total painted is 150, inner is 54. The total small cube faces are 98*6=588. So unpainted is 588-150=438. So that's correct. So the answer should be A)438. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of small cubes. Let me recalculate the number of small cubes in the hollow structure again. The hollow cube is 5cm, with walls 1cm thick. So the structure is like a frame. The total volume is 5^3 - (5-2)^3 =125-27=98. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of small cubes with unpainted faces, but that's not what the question says. The question is about the number of faces. \n\nHmm, maybe the problem is that when you have the hollow cube, the inner faces are part of the small cubes but are not considered because they are adjacent to air (the hollow). So those faces are indeed unpainted. So the calculation seems right. So I think the answer is A)438. \n\nWait, but let me see another way. Let's consider each small cube and count their unpainted faces. \n\nLet me categorize the small cubes based on their positions:\n\n1. Corner cubes: There are 8 corners on the hollow cube. Each corner cube is part of three outer faces (so three painted faces). The other three faces: two are part of the inner walls (so unpainted), and one is adjacent to another cube (so internal, unpainted). So each corner cube has 3 painted and 3 unpainted faces. \n\nEach corner cube contributes 3 unpainted. 8 cubes *3 =24.\n\n2. Edge cubes (not corners): The edges of the hollow cube. Each edge of the cube has length 5cm, but since it's a hollow structure with 1cm thickness, the edge has small cubes along it. Wait, but the edge is part of the outer surface. Let's think of an edge. Each edge of the cube (there are 12 edges) has 5 small cubes along it. But since it's the edge of the hollow cube, the first and last are the corners. So excluding the corners, each edge has 5-2=3 cubes. \n\nEach of these edge cubes (not corners) is on the edge of the outer cube, so they have two outer faces painted. The third outer face is along the edge. Wait, no. Wait, along an edge, each cube on the edge (but not a corner) has two painted faces (the two adjacent outer faces). The remaining four faces: one is along the edge towards the corner (but adjacent to another cube?), and the other three? Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of each edge cube (non-corner):\n\nTake an edge between two corners. For example, on the top front edge. Each cube on this edge (excluding corners) is part of two outer faces (front and top, say). So two painted faces. The other four faces: one is towards the adjacent cube along the edge (so internal), two are part of the inner surfaces (the sides facing the hollow), and one is the bottom face (if it's on the top edge, then maybe another direction). Hmm, perhaps it's better to think that each edge cube (non-corner) has two painted faces and the remaining four faces: one is adjacent to another cube (so internal), and three are on the inner surfaces. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of a specific example. Let's take an edge cube on the top edge of the cube's front face. The cube is part of the front face (painted) and the top face (painted). The third outer face would be the side (left or right, depending on the edge). Wait, no, each edge is where two faces meet. So a cube on the edge (not corner) has two painted faces. The remaining four faces: one is adjacent to another cube along the edge (so internal), and the other three are part of the inner walls. Wait, perhaps two of them are inner walls and one is adjacent to another cube. Hmm, this is getting confusing. Maybe it's easier to count the number of painted faces per cube and proceed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should calculate for each cube type:\n\nCorners: 8 cubes, each with 3 painted faces. So total painted from corners: 8*3=24.\n\nEdges (non-corner): Each edge has (length -2) cubes. Since each edge of the big cube is 5 units, so per edge, non-corner cubes:5-2=3. There are 12 edges. So 12*3=36 edge cubes. Each edge cube has 2 painted faces. So total painted from edges: 36*2=72.\n\nFaces (non-edge, non-corner): Each face of the cube has (5-2)*(5-2) =3*3=9 cubes. But since it's the outer layer, the face is part of the 5x5. Wait, the face of the hollow cube's outer surface: each face has 5x5=25 cubes. Subtract the edges and corners. Each face has 4 edges (each edge has 5 cubes, but corners are counted twice). So per face: 4 edges, each contributing (5-2) non-corner edge cubes. Wait, perhaps better to compute: each face has (5-2)*(5-2)=9 inner cubes (non-edge, non-corner). So per face: 9. There are 6 faces, so 6*9=54 face centers. Each of these has 1 painted face (the outer face), the rest are inner or adjacent. So each contributes 1 painted face. So total from face centers:54*1=54.\n\nThen the remaining cubes are the ones inside the structure but not on the faces, edges, or corners. Wait, but the structure is only 1cm thick. So the structure is the outer layer. So all cubes are on the outer layer. Therefore, there are no cubes inside the structure except those on the surfaces. Wait, the structure is 1cm thick, so the cubes are only on the outer surfaces. Therefore, all cubes are either corners, edges, or face centers. So total cubes: 8+36+54=98. Which matches the earlier count. \n\nSo total painted faces: 24 (corners) +72 (edges) +54 (face centers) = 150. Which matches the surface area calculation. \n\nTherefore, the total painted faces are 150, so the total unpainted is total faces (588) minus 150 =438. So the answer should be A)438.\n\nBut the options include E)498. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes? Wait, let me check again. The structure is 5^3 -3^3 =125-27=98. So that's correct. Each small cube has 6 faces. So 98*6=588. Yes. So 588-150=438. So the answer must be A. So why is there an option E?\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nThe question says: \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\".\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that when considering the inner surfaces (the hollow part's walls), those faces are part of the small cubes but are not painted. So those are counted in the unpainted. But also, the faces between the small cubes (the ones glued to each other) are also unpainted. So total unpainted is indeed (total faces) - (painted faces) =588-150=438. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed that some of the inner surfaces are counted as part of the outer structure? Or maybe the question considers that the inner surface is painted? No, the problem states the outer surface is painted. The inner is not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not hollow? Wait, no, the question says it's a hollow cube with thickness 1cm. So my approach seems correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is E)498? Let me see what 588 - 90=498. Where would 90 come from? Wait, maybe I miscalculated the painted faces. Let me recalculate the painted faces again using the cube types:\n\nCorners:8*3=24\n\nEdges:12 edges, each with 3 non-corner cubes (since 5-2=3), so 12*3=36. Each has 2 painted: 36*2=72. Total so far:24+72=96.\n\nFaces: each face has (5-2)^2=9 face centers. 6 faces:54. Each has 1 painted face:54. So total painted:96+54=150. So correct.\n\nHmm, so the calculation is right. Then the answer must be A)438. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)438\n\nB)550\n\nC)500\n\nD)450\n\nE)498\n\nSo 438 is there. So the correct answer should be A. Maybe the options are correct, so I think I'm right.\n\n\nThe hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5cm and an inner hollow space of 3cm (due to 1cm thickness). The total number of small cubes in the structure is \\(5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98\\). Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces is \\(98 \\times 6 = 588\\). \n\nThe outer surface area of the hollow cube is \\(6 \\times (5 \\times 5) = 150\\) faces, which are all painted. The remaining faces are unpainted. Thus, the number of unpainted faces is \\(588 - 150 = 438\\).\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hollow cube and figuring out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Let me try to break this down step by step. Hmm, first, I need to visualize the cube. The cube is hollow, right? The size is 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm. The small cubes are 1cm each. \n\nWait, the cube is hollow. So the structure is like a cube frame. The thickness is 1cm, meaning that the walls of the cube are 1cm thick. Since the entire cube is 5cm on each side, the hollow part inside must be smaller. Let me think: the outer cube is 5x5x5. But since it's hollow with 1cm thickness, the inner hollow part would be a cube of (5 - 2*1) cm on each side. Because the thickness comes from both sides. So the inner cube would be 3cm on each edge. So the structure is like the outer layer is 1cm thick, forming the shell. \n\nNow, the problem says the outer surface is painted. So all the outer faces of the hollow cube are painted. The question is asking how many of the small cubes' faces are unpainted. Wait, actually, the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the question says \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\" So we need to count all the individual faces of all the small cubes that are not painted. \n\nHmm. Let me think. The entire structure is made up of small cubes. Let me first figure out how many small cubes there are in total. Since the cube is hollow, the total number of small cubes is the volume of the outer cube minus the volume of the hollow inner cube. \n\nThe outer cube is 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes. The inner hollow part is 3x3x3 =27. So total small cubes used would be 125-27 = 98? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no, because the thickness is 1 cm. So actually, the hollow part is a cube of size (5 - 2*1) = 3 on each edge. So yes, 3^3=27. So total cubes used are 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 -27 = 98. Wait, but each small cube is 1cm, so that's correct. So there are 98 small cubes in the hollow structure. \n\nBut the question isn't about the number of cubes, but the number of their faces that are unpainted. Hmm. So each small cube has 6 faces. But some of their faces are on the exterior (and thus painted) and some are inside or adjacent to other cubes (so unpainted). \n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach: first calculate the total number of faces of all the small cubes, then subtract the number of painted faces. The result would be the unpainted ones. \n\nLet me try that approach. \n\nTotal number of small cubes is 98. Each has 6 faces, so total faces: 98*6 = 588. \n\nNow, the painted faces are those on the outer surface of the hollow cube. So the outer surface of the hollow cube is the same as the outer surface of a solid cube of size 5cm, except that the inner surfaces (the hollow part) are not painted. Wait, but since the cube is hollow, the inner surfaces (the surfaces facing the hollow part) are not painted. \n\nWait, the outer surface of the hollow cube is the same as the outer surface of the 5cm cube. So each face of the hollow cube is a 5x5 square, but since the cube is hollow, the inner part of that face is actually part of the hollow. Wait, no, the outer surface is the outside of the cube. So each face of the hollow cube has an area of 5x5, but since it's hollow, the inner part of that face (the part that's not part of the hollow's inner walls?) Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. \n\nAlternatively, the total painted area is the surface area of the hollow cube. The surface area of a cube is 6*(edge length)^2. But since it's hollow, does that affect the surface area? Wait, no, because the hollow part is inside. The outer surface is still 6*(5)^2 = 150 cm\u00b2. But since the cube is hollow, but the thickness is 1cm, so each face of the hollow cube is like a 5x5 square with a 3x3 square missing in the center (since the inner hollow is 3x3x3). Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think again. \n\nEach face of the hollow cube has an outer surface. But the cube is hollow with 1cm thickness. So each face of the cube (front, back, etc.) is a square of 5x5 cm. The thickness is 1cm, so the inner side of that face would be a 3x3 cm area (since 5-2*1=3). But when we paint the outer surface, we are only painting the outer layer. The inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow part) are not painted. \n\nTherefore, the total painted area is the surface area of the outer cube, which is 6*(5)^2 = 150 cm\u00b2. Each cm\u00b2 corresponds to one face of a small cube. So the painted faces are 150. \n\nWait, but that would be if the entire outer surface is painted. But in reality, the hollow cube's outer surface is made up of the outer layer of small cubes, so the painted faces are exactly the outer surfaces of those. So the total painted faces are indeed 6*(5x5) = 150. \n\nBut the total number of faces in all small cubes is 98*6 = 588. \n\nSo the unpainted faces would be total faces minus painted faces, but wait, no. Because some of the small cubes' faces are adjacent to other small cubes (so they are internal and not painted). So the total number of unpainted faces would be the total faces minus the painted ones, but also subtract the internal faces that are between small cubes. \n\nHmm, maybe I need another approach. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of unpainted faces is equal to all the faces except those on the exterior. So the exterior faces are painted (150), and the rest are either internal (between small cubes) or inside the hollow part. Wait, but the hollow part's inner surfaces are also unpainted. Because the problem says only the outer surface is painted. \n\nHmm, so the inner surfaces (the surfaces facing the hollow part) are also unpainted. So the total unpainted faces include both the internal faces between the small cubes (like the ones adjacent to other cubes) and the inner surfaces of the hollow cube. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the total number of faces that are not on the outer surface. Let me try this:\n\nTotal faces of all small cubes: 98 *6 = 588.\n\nTotal painted faces: 150 (the outer surface area).\n\nThe remaining faces (588-150 =438) would include both the internal faces (between small cubes) and the inner surfaces of the hollow part (which are not painted). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. So all faces except the painted ones are unpainted. So the answer would be 588-150=438? But that's option A. But I feel like maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check the options. Option A is 438, which would be that result. But let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow part) are also considered. For example, the hollow part is inside the cube, so the inner walls of the cube (the surfaces that are part of the cube's structure but face the hollow) are not painted. Are those counted in the total? \n\nWait, in the problem statement, the outer surface is painted. So any face that is on the exterior is painted. The inner surfaces (the ones that form the hollow cavity) are not painted. So those inner surfaces are part of the small cubes' faces and are unpainted. \n\nTherefore, the total unpainted faces are indeed all faces except the 150 painted ones. So total unpainted is 588-150=438. Which would be option A. But wait, maybe my calculation is wrong here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, let me consider that each small cube on the edge or corner might have some painted faces, but perhaps I need to think in terms of the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my approach is oversimplified. Let me try another way.\n\nFirst, the hollow cube is made up of small cubes of 1cm. The outer cube is 5x5x5. The thickness is 1cm, so the inner hollow cube is 3x3x3. Therefore, the structure is a 5x5x5 cube minus a 3x3x3 cube. The number of small cubes is indeed 125-27=98.\n\nEach small cube can be categorized based on their position. Let me think of the cube as layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of unpainted faces can be calculated by considering each face of the hollow cube and subtracting the painted parts, but this might get complicated. \n\nAlternatively, think of each face of the hollow cube. Each face of the big cube (5x5) has a painted outer surface. The inner part of that face (the part that's adjacent to the hollow) would form a 3x3 area. Wait, but the thickness is 1cm, so each face of the hollow cube's outer surface is 5x5, and the inner surface (the side facing the hollow) would also be 3x3? Wait, perhaps each face of the hollow cube has an outer 5x5 and an inner 3x3. But the thickness is 1cm, so the inner part is 3x3. \n\nWait, the structure of each face: imagine looking at one face of the cube. The outer surface is a 5x5 square. The inner side of that face (the part that's part of the hollow) would be a 3x3 square. The area between the outer and inner is the 1cm thick wall. So the total number of small cubes on that face is (5x5) minus the inner 3x3? No, actually, each face's thickness is 1cm, so the cross-section is 5cm in length, but the depth is 1cm (the thickness). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the total painted area is the surface area of the outer cube, which is 6*(5)^2=150. Each of those is a 1x1 face, so 150 painted faces. \n\nThe total number of faces on all small cubes is 98*6=588. So the unpainted would be 588-150=438, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the outer surface of the cube is painted\". So the inner surfaces (the ones that form the inner walls of the hollow part) are not painted. So those inner faces are also unpainted. But in my calculation above, those are included in the 588-150=438. \n\nWait, but in this calculation, yes. Because the total faces of all small cubes include their inner faces (those adjacent to other small cubes or the hollow) as well as the outer ones. So when I subtract the 150 painted faces (the outer ones), the remaining 438 would include all the other faces (both the ones between small cubes and the inner surfaces). \n\nTherefore, that would be correct, so the answer is A)438. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498. \n\nHmm, but I recall that sometimes in these problems, the inner surfaces (those facing the hollow) are considered as part of the cube's structure but not painted. But according to the calculation, that's already accounted for. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes? Let me recalculate that. \n\nThe hollow cube is 5cm on each edge, with 1cm thickness. So the structure is like a 5x5x5 cube minus a 3x3x3 cube. So 125 -27= 98. That's correct. \n\nSo 98 small cubes, each with 6 faces: 98x6=588. \n\nTotal painted: the surface area of the outer cube is 6*(5)^2=150. So 150 faces are painted. \n\nThus, unpainted is 588-150=438. \n\nHmm. So that would be answer A. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow) are part of the small cubes' faces, but they are adjacent to the hollow, so those faces are not covered by another cube. So those would be considered as \"unpainted\" but they are part of the cube's structure. \n\nWait, but in the total count of all small cube faces, those inner faces (facing the hollow) are part of the small cubes. For example, a cube on the edge of the hollow would have a face exposed to the hollow. So that face is not painted. So those are included in the total 588, and subtracted by the 150 painted, so they are part of the 438. So that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the inner surfaces are not part of the \"faces\" of the small cubes? No, that doesn't make sense. Each small cube's face is counted regardless of whether it's adjacent to another cube or air (hollow). \n\nWait, but when two small cubes are adjacent, their touching faces are not exposed, so those are internal and unpainted. So in the total faces (588), the ones that are adjacent to other cubes are counted as part of the total but are internal (so unpainted). The ones on the outer surface are painted (150). The ones on the inner surface (facing the hollow) are also unpainted. \n\nSo the total unpainted would indeed be 588 - 150. \n\nHmm. So unless there's an error in this logic, the answer should be A)438. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the surface area. Let me think again. The outer surface area is indeed 6*(5^2) =150. So that's correct. \n\nWait, but perhaps the inner surfaces (the surfaces of the hollow) are also part of the cube's structure. Wait, but the problem says only the outer surface is painted. The inner surfaces (the hollow-facing sides) are not painted, so they are part of the unpainted count. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the inner surfaces are part of the \"outer\" surface? No, that wouldn't make sense. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the number of small cubes. Let me think again. \n\nThe cube is hollow with 1cm thickness. The cube's total size is 5x5x5. The hollow part is a cube of 3x3x3. So the number of small cubes used is 5^3 -3^3 = 125 -27=98. That's correct. \n\nHmm. So I think the calculation is right. The answer should be 438, option A. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options, the first one is A)438. So that's the conclusion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of small cubes that have unpainted faces, but no, the question is how many faces remain unpainted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me think of each face of the hollow cube. \n\nEach face of the big cube (5x5) has an outer surface painted. The total painted faces are 6*(5*5) =150, as before. \n\nNow, each small cube on the surface of the hollow cube has some painted faces, but the ones inside the hollow's walls have some unpainted faces. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of unpainted faces can be calculated by considering all the small cubes except those on the outer layer. Wait, but the hollow cube's structure is such that the outer layer is 1cm thick. So all the small cubes are part of the outer layer. Wait, no. The hollow cube's structure is like a shell. The entire structure is made up of the outer 1cm layer. Because the thickness is 1cm, so there are no cubes inside except the hollow. So every small cube is on the outer surface? No, that can't be. Because the cube is hollow, so the cubes form the walls. So each face of the cube (front, back, etc.) has a layer of 1cm thick. \n\nWait, in a hollow cube with 5cm size and 1cm thickness, the cubes are arranged such that each face's thickness is 1cm. So, for example, the front face has a layer of 1cm thick, which is 5x5x1 small cubes. Similarly for the back, top, bottom, left, right. But overlapping at the edges and corners. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the total number of small cubes as follows. \n\nThe hollow cube has 6 faces. Each face is a 5x5 square, but with a 3x3 square missing from the center (since the thickness is 1cm, so the inner part is 3x3). So each face has (5x5 -3x3) = 25-9=16 small cubes. But multiplied by 6 faces gives 96, but that's overlapping at the edges and corners. \n\nAlternatively, the correct way to compute the number of small cubes in a hollow cube is (Surface area * thickness)/volume of small cube. But the surface area of a cube is 6*(5)^2=150. Thickness is 1cm, so volume is 150*1=150 cm\u00b3. But the hollow part is 3^3=27, so total volume is 150? But 5^3-3^3 is 98, not 150. Hmm, so that approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, maybe my initial calculation was correct. So 98 small cubes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the inner surface is counted. Let me think of each small cube and how many of their faces are painted. \n\nThe small cubes can be categorized as follows: \n\n1. Corner cubes: Each corner of the hollow cube is a cube. There are 8 corners. Each corner cube is part of three faces of the hollow cube. Since the thickness is 1cm, each corner cube is on the outer layer. So each corner cube has 3 faces painted (the ones on the outside). The other three faces: one adjacent to another cube (so internal, unpainted), and the other two are part of the inner walls (facing the hollow). Wait, no. Wait, each corner cube is at the corner of the outer cube. The inner part of the cube would be adjacent to the hollow. For example, take a corner cube. It has three faces on the exterior (painted), and the other three faces: one adjacent to another cube (part of the structure), and two faces that are part of the inner walls (facing the hollow). Wait, actually, in a hollow cube's corner, the corner cube's inner faces would be part of the inner walls. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to think of each small cube as being part of the outer shell. Each such cube has some exterior faces (painted), some adjacent to other cubes (so internal), and some facing the hollow (unpainted). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of unpainted faces can be calculated by considering all the faces except the outer ones. \n\nTotal faces of all small cubes: 98*6=588.\n\nTotal painted faces: 150 (as before).\n\nThus, unpainted faces:588-150=438. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A)438. \n\nHmm. The options given include that. So I think that's correct. \n\nBut wait, another way to check. Let me consider the inner surfaces. The hollow cube's inner surface area would be the surface area of the inner cube, but since it's hollow, that's 6*(3)^2=54. But each of those inner surfaces is made up of small cube faces. So each inner face (the inner walls) contribute 3x3=9 small cube faces per face. So total inner surface area:6*(3*3)=54 small cube faces. Those are all unpainted. \n\nThe total number of small cube faces that are internal (between two cubes) can be calculated as follows. The total number of adjacent pairs between small cubes: \n\nTotal internal adjacent faces = total small cube faces - (total painted faces + total inner surface faces). \n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, the total faces of all small cubes = painted faces + unpainted faces (which include inner surfaces and internal adjacent faces). \n\nAlternatively, the total number of internal faces (between two cubes) can be calculated by considering that each internal face is shared between two cubes, so the total number of such shared faces would be (total adjacent pairs) *1. \n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, total painted:150. Inner surfaces (facing the hollow):54. The rest of the faces are either between small cubes (so not exposed) or part of the inner surfaces. \n\nWait, the total faces:588. \n\nTotal painted:150. \n\nTotal inner surfaces (facing the hollow):6*(3x3)=54. \n\nSo the remaining faces:588-150-54= 384. These would be the faces between the small cubes (each such face is shared between two cubes, so when counting all small cubes' faces, each internal adjacency is counted twice). \n\nBut in any case, the question is asking for the total number of unpainted faces, which would include both the inner surfaces (54) and the internal adjacent faces (the ones between small cubes, which are not painted). \n\nWait, but in the calculation of 588-150, we already subtracted the painted ones, so the rest includes both the inner surfaces and the internal adjacent faces. So that's correct. \n\nThus, the answer is 438, which is option A. \n\nHmm. I think that's the right approach. So the answer should be A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm, meaning the inner hollow space is a 3cm cube. The total number of small cubes is \\(5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98\\). Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces is \\(98 \\times 6 = 588\\). \n\nThe outer surface area of the hollow cube is the same as a solid cube of 5cm, which is \\(6 \\times 5^2 = 150\\) faces.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a hollow cube and figuring out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. Let me try to break this down step by step. Hmm, first, I need to visualize the cube. The cube is hollow, right? The size is 5cm, and the thickness is 1cm. The small cubes are 1cm each. \n\nWait, the cube is hollow. So the structure is like a cube frame. The thickness is 1cm, meaning that the walls of the cube are 1cm thick. Since the entire cube is 5cm on each side, the hollow part inside must be smaller. Let me think: the outer cube is 5x5x5. But since it's hollow with 1cm thickness, the inner hollow part would be a cube of (5 - 2*1) cm on each side. Because the thickness comes from both sides. So the inner cube would be 3cm on each edge. So the structure is like the outer layer is 1cm thick, forming the shell. \n\nNow, the problem says the outer surface is painted. So all the outer faces of the hollow cube are painted. The question is asking how many of the small cubes' faces are unpainted. Wait, actually, the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, the question says \"how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted?\" So we need to count all the individual faces of all the small cubes that are not painted. \n\nHmm. Let me think. The entire structure is made up of small cubes. Let me first figure out how many small cubes there are in total. Since the cube is hollow, the total number of small cubes is the volume of the outer cube minus the volume of the hollow inner cube. \n\nThe outer cube is 5x5x5 = 125 small cubes. The inner hollow part is 3x3x3 =27. So total small cubes used would be 125-27 = 98? Wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no, because the thickness is 1 cm. So actually, the hollow part is a cube of size (5 - 2*1) = 3 on each edge. So yes, 3^3=27. So total cubes used are 5^3 - 3^3 = 125 -27 = 98. Wait, but each small cube is 1cm, so that's correct. So there are 98 small cubes in the hollow structure. \n\nBut the question isn't about the number of cubes, but the number of their faces that are unpainted. Hmm. So each small cube has 6 faces. But some of their faces are on the exterior (and thus painted) and some are inside or adjacent to other cubes (so unpainted). \n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach: first calculate the total number of faces of all the small cubes, then subtract the number of painted faces. The result would be the unpainted ones. \n\nLet me try that approach. \n\nTotal number of small cubes is 98. Each has 6 faces, so total faces: 98*6 = 588. \n\nNow, the painted faces are those on the outer surface of the hollow cube. So the outer surface of the hollow cube is the same as the outer surface of a solid cube of size 5cm, except that the inner surfaces (the hollow part) are not painted. Wait, but since the cube is hollow, the inner surfaces (the surfaces facing the hollow part) are not painted. \n\nWait, the outer surface of the hollow cube is the same as the outer surface of the 5cm cube. So each face of the hollow cube is a 5x5 square, but since the cube is hollow, the inner part of that face is actually part of the hollow. Wait, no, the outer surface is the outside of the cube. So each face of the hollow cube has an area of 5x5, but since it's hollow, the inner part of that face (the part that's not part of the hollow's inner walls?) Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. \n\nAlternatively, the total painted area is the surface area of the hollow cube. The surface area of a cube is 6*(edge length)^2. But since it's hollow, does that affect the surface area? Wait, no, because the hollow part is inside. The outer surface is still 6*(5)^2 = 150 cm\u00b2. But since the cube is hollow, but the thickness is 1cm, so each face of the hollow cube is like a 5x5 square with a 3x3 square missing in the center (since the inner hollow is 3x3x3). Wait, no, maybe not exactly. Let me think again. \n\nEach face of the hollow cube has an outer surface. But the cube is hollow with 1cm thickness. So each face of the cube (front, back, etc.) is a square of 5x5 cm. The thickness is 1cm, so the inner side of that face would be a 3x3 cm area (since 5-2*1=3). But when we paint the outer surface, we are only painting the outer layer. The inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow part) are not painted. \n\nTherefore, the total painted area is the surface area of the outer cube, which is 6*(5)^2 = 150 cm\u00b2. Each cm\u00b2 corresponds to one face of a small cube. So the painted faces are 150. \n\nWait, but that would be if the entire outer surface is painted. But in reality, the hollow cube's outer surface is made up of the outer layer of small cubes, so the painted faces are exactly the outer surfaces of those. So the total painted faces are indeed 6*(5x5) = 150. \n\nBut the total number of faces in all small cubes is 98*6 = 588. \n\nSo the unpainted faces would be total faces minus painted faces, but wait, no. Because some of the small cubes' faces are adjacent to other small cubes (so they are internal and not painted). So the total number of unpainted faces would be the total faces minus the painted ones, but also subtract the internal faces that are between small cubes. \n\nHmm, maybe I need another approach. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, the total number of unpainted faces is equal to all the faces except those on the exterior. So the exterior faces are painted (150), and the rest are either internal (between small cubes) or inside the hollow part. Wait, but the hollow part's inner surfaces are also unpainted. Because the problem says only the outer surface is painted. \n\nHmm, so the inner surfaces (the surfaces facing the hollow part) are also unpainted. So the total unpainted faces include both the internal faces between the small cubes (like the ones adjacent to other cubes) and the inner surfaces of the hollow cube. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the total number of faces that are not on the outer surface. Let me try this:\n\nTotal faces of all small cubes: 98 *6 = 588.\n\nTotal painted faces: 150 (the outer surface area).\n\nThe remaining faces (588-150 =438) would include both the internal faces (between small cubes) and the inner surfaces of the hollow part (which are not painted). \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted. So all faces except the painted ones are unpainted. So the answer would be 588-150=438? But that's option A. But I feel like maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check the options. Option A is 438, which would be that result. But let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow part) are also considered.

The inner surfaces (the ones that form the hollow cavity) are not painted.

Let me think again.\n\nWait, let me consider that each small cube on the edge or corner might have some painted faces, but perhaps I need to think in terms of the structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my approach is oversimplified. Let me try another way.\n\nFirst, the hollow cube is made up of small cubes of 1cm. The outer cube is 5x5x5. The thickness is 1cm, so the inner hollow cube is 3x3x3. Therefore, the structure is a 5x5x5 cube minus a 3x3x3 cube. The number of small cubes is indeed 125-27=98.\n\nEach small cube can be categorized based on their position. Let me think of the cube as layers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of unpainted faces can be calculated by considering each face of the hollow cube and subtracting the painted parts, but this might get complicated. \n\nAlternatively, think of each face of the hollow cube. Each face of the big cube (5x5) has a painted outer surface. The inner part of that face (the part that's adjacent to the hollow) would form a 3x3 area. Wait, but the thickness is 1cm, so each face of the hollow cube's outer surface is 5x5, and the inner surface (the side facing the hollow) would also be 3x3? Wait, perhaps each face of the hollow cube has an outer 5x5 and an inner 3x3. But the thickness is 1cm, so the inner part is 3x3. \n\nWait, the structure of each face: imagine looking at one face of the cube. The outer surface is a 5x5 square. The inner side of that face (the part that's part of the hollow) would be a 3x3 square. The area between the outer and inner is the 1cm thick wall. So the total number of small cubes on that face is (5x5) minus the inner 3x3? No, actually, each face's thickness is 1cm, so the cross-section is 5cm in length, but the depth is 1cm (the thickness). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the total painted area is the surface area of the outer cube, which is 6*(5)^2=150. Each of those is a 1x1 face, so 150 painted faces. \n\nThe total number of faces on all small cubes is 98*6=588. So the unpainted would be 588-150=438, which is option A. \n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the outer surface of the cube is painted\". So the inner surfaces (the ones that form the inner walls of the hollow part) are not painted. So those inner faces are also unpainted. But in my calculation above, those are included in the 588-150=438. \n\nWait, but in this calculation, yes. Because the total faces of all small cubes include their inner faces (those adjacent to other small cubes or the hollow) as well as the outer ones. So when I subtract the 150 painted faces (the outer ones), the remaining 438 would include all the other faces (both the ones between small cubes and the inner surfaces). \n\nTherefore, that would be correct, so the answer is A)438. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)438, B)550, C)500, D)450, E)498. \n\nHmm, but I recall that sometimes in these problems, the inner surfaces (those facing the hollow) are considered as part of the cube's structure but not painted. But according to the calculation, that's already accounted for. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the total number of small cubes? Let me recalculate that. \n\nThe hollow cube is 5cm on each edge, with 1cm thickness. So the structure is like a 5x5x5 cube minus a 3x3x3 cube. So 125 -27= 98. That's correct. \n\nSo 98 small cubes, each with 6 faces: 98x6=588. \n\nTotal painted: the surface area of the outer cube is 6*(5)^2=150. So 150 faces are painted. \n\nThus, unpainted is 588-150=438. \n\nHmm. So that would be answer A. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Wait, perhaps the inner surfaces (the ones facing the hollow) are part of the small cubes' faces, but they are adjacent to the hollow, so those faces are not covered by another cube. So those would be considered as \"unpainted\" but they are part of the cube's structure. \n\nWait, but in the total count of all small cube faces, those inner faces (facing the hollow) are part of the small cubes. For example, a cube on the edge of the hollow would have a face exposed to the hollow. So that face is not painted. So those are included in the total 588, and subtracted by the 150 painted, so they are part of the 438. So that seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the inner surfaces are not part of the \"faces\" of the small cubes? No, that doesn't make sense. Each small cube's face is counted regardless of whether it's adjacent to another cube or air (hollow). \n\nWait, but when two small cubes are adjacent, their touching faces are not exposed, so those are internal and unpainted. So in the total faces (588), the ones that are adjacent to other cubes are counted as part of the total but are internal (so unpainted). The ones on the outer surface are painted (150). The ones on the inner surface (facing the hollow) are also unpainted. \n\nSo the total unpainted would indeed be 588 - 150. \n\nHmm. So unless there's an error in this logic, the answer should be A)438. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the surface area. Let me think again. The outer surface area is indeed 6*(5^2) =150. So that's correct. \n\nWait, but perhaps the inner surfaces (the surfaces of the hollow) are also part of the cube's structure. Wait, but the problem says only the outer surface is painted. The inner surfaces (the hollow-facing sides) are not painted, so they are part of the unpainted count. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the inner surfaces are part of the \"outer\" surface? No, that wouldn't make sense. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated the number of small cubes. Let me think again. \n\nThe cube is hollow with 1cm thickness. The cube's total size is 5x5x5. The hollow part is a cube of 3x3x3. So the number of small cubes used is 5^3 -3^3 = 125 -27=98. That's correct. \n\nHmm. So I think the calculation is right. The answer should be 438, option A. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options, the first one is A)438. So that's the conclusion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of small cubes that have unpainted faces, but no, the question is how many faces remain unpainted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me think of each face of the hollow cube. \n\nEach face of the big cube (5x5) has an outer surface painted. The total painted faces are 6*(5*5) =150, as before. \n\nNow, each small cube on the surface of the hollow cube has some painted faces, but the ones inside the hollow's walls have some unpainted faces. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of unpainted faces can be calculated by considering all the small cubes except those on the outer layer. Wait, but the hollow cube's structure is such that the outer layer is 1cm thick. So all the small cubes are part of the outer layer. Wait, no. The hollow cube's structure is like a shell. The entire structure is made up of the outer 1cm layer. Because the thickness is 1cm, so there are no cubes inside except the hollow. So every small cube is on the outer surface? No, that can't be. Because the cube is hollow, so the cubes form the walls. So each face of the cube (front, back, etc.) has a layer of 1cm thick. \n\nWait, in a hollow cube with 5cm size and 1cm thickness, the cubes are arranged such that each face's thickness is 1cm. So, for example, the front face has a layer of 1cm thick, which is 5x5x1 small cubes. Similarly for the back, top, bottom, left, right. But overlapping at the edges and corners. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of the total number of small cubes as follows. \n\nThe hollow cube has 6 faces. Each face is a 5x5 square, but with a 3x3 square missing from the center (since the thickness is 1cm, so the inner part is 3x3). So each face has (5x5 -3x3) = 25-9=16 small cubes. But multiplied by 6 faces gives 96, but that's overlapping at the edges and corners. \n\nAlternatively, the correct way to compute the number of small cubes in a hollow cube is (Surface area * thickness)/volume of small cube. But the surface area of a cube is 6*(5)^2=150. Thickness is 1cm, so volume is 150*1=150 cm\u00b3. But the hollow part is 3^3=27, so total volume is 150? But 5^3-3^3 is 98, not 150. Hmm, so that approach is wrong. \n\nHmm, maybe my initial calculation was correct. So 98 small cubes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the inner surface is counted. Let me think of each small cube and how many of their faces are painted. \n\nThe small cubes can be categorized as follows: \n\n1. Corner cubes: Each corner of the hollow cube is a cube. There are 8 corners. Each corner cube is part of three faces of the hollow cube. Since the thickness is 1cm, each corner cube is on the outer layer. So each corner cube has 3 faces painted (the ones on the outside). The other three faces: one adjacent to another cube (so internal, unpainted), and the other two are part of the inner walls (facing the hollow). Wait, no. Wait, each corner cube is at the corner of the outer cube. The inner part of the cube would be adjacent to the hollow. For example, take a corner cube. It has three faces on the exterior (painted), and the other three faces: one adjacent to another cube (part of the structure), and two faces that are part of the inner walls (facing the hollow). Wait, actually, in a hollow cube's corner, the corner cube's inner faces would be part of the inner walls. \n\nHmm, perhaps it's better to think of each small cube as being part of the outer shell. Each such cube has some exterior faces (painted), some adjacent to other cubes (so internal), and some facing the hollow (unpainted). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of unpainted faces can be calculated by considering all the faces except the outer ones. \n\nTotal faces of all small cubes: 98*6=588.\n\nTotal painted faces: 150 (as before).\n\nThus, unpainted faces:588-150=438. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be A)438. \n\nHmm. The options given include that. So I think that's correct. \n\nBut wait, another way to check. Let me consider the inner surfaces. The hollow cube's inner surface area would be the surface area of the inner cube, but since it's hollow, that's 6*(3)^2=54. But each of those inner surfaces is made up of small cube faces. So each inner face (the inner walls) contribute 3x3=9 small cube faces per face. So total inner surface area:6*(3*3)=54 small cube faces. Those are all unpainted. \n\nThe total number of small cube faces that are internal (between two cubes) can be calculated as follows. The total number of adjacent pairs between small cubes: \n\nTotal internal adjacent faces = total small cube faces - (total painted faces + total inner surface faces). \n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, the total faces of all small cubes = painted faces + unpainted faces (which include inner surfaces and internal adjacent faces). \n\nAlternatively, the total number of internal faces (between two cubes) can be calculated by considering that each internal face is shared between two cubes, so the total number of such shared faces would be (total adjacent pairs) *1. \n\nBut maybe this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, total painted:150. Inner surfaces (facing the hollow):54. The rest of the faces are either between small cubes (so not exposed) or part of the inner surfaces. \n\nWait, the total faces:588. \n\nTotal painted:150. \n\nTotal inner surfaces (facing the hollow):6*(3x3)=54. \n\nSo the remaining faces:588-150-54= 384. These would be the faces between the small cubes (each such face is shared between two cubes, so when counting all small cubes' faces, each internal adjacency is counted twice). \n\nBut in any case, the question is asking for the total number of unpainted faces, which would include both the inner surfaces (54) and the internal adjacent faces (the ones between small cubes, which are not painted). \n\nWait, but in the calculation of 588-150, we already subtracted the painted ones, so the rest includes both the inner surfaces and the internal adjacent faces. So that's correct. \n\nThus, the answer is 438, which is option A. \n\nHmm. I think that's the right approach. So the answer should be A.\n\n\nThe hollow cube has an outer dimension of 5cm and a thickness of 1cm, meaning the inner hollow space is a 3cm cube. The total number of small cubes is \\(5^3 - 3^3 = 125 - 27 = 98\\). Each small cube has 6 faces, so the total number of faces is \\(98 \\times 6 = 588\\). \n\nThe outer surface area of the hollow cube is the same as a solid cube of 5cm, which is \\(6 \\times 5^2 = 150\\) faces. These 150 faces are painted. \n\nThe unpainted faces include all other faces not on the outer surface. Subtracting the painted faces from the total gives \\(588 - 150 = 438\\). This accounts for both internal faces between small cubes and the inner surfaces of the hollow part. \n\nThus, the correct answer is **A)438**.\n\nAnswer: A",
