      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the telephone bill is partly fixed and partly varies with the number of calls. So, that means the total bill can be represented by an equation like Total = Fixed + Variable*Calls. Right?\n\nThe problem gives two scenarios. First, when there are 540 calls, the bill is 1800 rupees. Then, when there are 620 calls, it's 2040. We need to find the bill when 500 calls are made. \n\nLet me denote the fixed part as F and the variable cost per call as V. So, the equations would be:\n\nFor the first case: F + 540V = 1800\nSecond case: F + 620V = 2040\n\nI can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F. Let's see:\n\n(F +620V) - (F +540V) = 2040 - 1800\nThat simplifies to 80V = 240. So, V = 240 /80 = 3. So the variable cost per call is 3 rupees.\n\nNow plug back V into one of the equations to find F. Let's take the first one:\n\nF +540*3 = 1800\n540*3 is 1620. So F = 1800 - 1620 = 180. So fixed cost is 180.\n\nNow, for 500 calls, the total would be F +500V = 180 +500*3. Let me calculate that: 500*3 is 1500, plus 180 is 1680. So the answer should be B) 1680. Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, let me verify with the second equation. If V is 3 and F is 180, then 620*3 is 1860, plus 180 gives 2040, which matches the second case. So that's correct. Then 500 calls would indeed be 180 +1500 =1680. So the answer must be B.\n",
