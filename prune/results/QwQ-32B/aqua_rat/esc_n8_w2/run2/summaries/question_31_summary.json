      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out this percentage problem. Hmm. The question says the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. Then it was sold for 20% less than that original price. And I have to find what percent more than the wholesale cost it was sold for. \n\nAlright, maybe I should start by assigning variables to make this concrete. Let me think. Let's call the wholesale cost W. Then the original retail price is 60% more than W. So, how do I calculate that? \n\nRight, 60% more than W would be W plus 60% of W. So that's W * (1 + 0.60) which is 1.6W. So original retail price is 1.6 times the wholesale cost. \n\nNow, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So the selling price is 80% of the original retail price. Because 100% - 20% = 80%. \n\nSo the selling price would be 0.8 multiplied by the original retail price. Since the original was 1.6W, multiplying those together: 0.8 * 1.6W. Let me calculate that. \n\n0.8 * 1.6... Hmm, 1.6 times 0.8. Let me do the math. 1.6 * 0.8. Well, 1 times 0.8 is 0.8, and 0.6 * 0.8 is 0.48. So adding them together gives 1.28. So that's 1.28 times W. \n\nSo the selling price is 1.28W. The question is asking for what percent more than the wholesale cost. So compared to W, the selling price is 1.28 times W, which is 28% more than W. Because 1.28 is 1 + 0.28, so 28% increase. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nOriginal retail price is 60% over wholesale. So if W is 100, then original retail is 160. Then sold at 20% less than 160. 20% of 160 is 32, so 160 -32 = 128. So selling price is 128. The wholesale was 100, so 128 is 28% more than 100. Yep that checks out. \n\nSo the answer should be 28%, which is option B. Let me check the options again. The options are A)20%, B)28%, C)36%, D)40%, E)42%. So B is correct. \n\nHmm, I think that's right. Another way to think: the combined effect. The original price is 1.6 times W. Then selling at 0.8 of that. So total factor is 1.6*0.8 =1.28, which is 28% over. Yep. So answer is B.\n",

Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original retail price was 60% more than the wholesale cost. Let me denote the wholesale cost as, say, W. So the original retail price would be W plus 60% of W. That would be W * (1 + 0.60) which is 1.6W. Got that part.\n\nThen, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So the selling price is 80% of the original retail price. Because 100% minus 20% is 80%. So that would be 0.8 multiplied by the original retail price.

Option B is 28%, which matches. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use an example with actual numbers to confirm. Let's pick a wholesale cost. Suppose the wholesale cost is $100. Then original retail is 60% more, so 100 + 60% of 100 = $160. Then, selling it for 20% less than original retail: 20% of 160 is 32, so 160 -32 = $128. So the selling price is $128.
