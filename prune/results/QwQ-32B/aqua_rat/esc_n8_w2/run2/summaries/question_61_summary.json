      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we have a class where different percentages of students are interested in various sports, and the rest aren't interested in any. We need to find the total number of students. The question gives us the breakdown: 8% Football, 4/5 Cricket, 10% Basketball, and then 20 students not interested. \n\nFirst, I should note that all these percentages (or fractions) add up to some portion of the total, and the remaining students (the 20) make up the rest. So maybe I can express all these as fractions or percentages of the total and then set up an equation where the sum of all interested students plus the 20 equals the total number of students.\n\nLet me denote the total number of students as N. \n\nBreaking it down:\n\n- Football: 8% of N \u2192 0.08N\n- Cricket: 4/5 of N \u2192 which is 0.8N (since 4 divided by 5 is 0.8)\n- Basketball: 10% \u2192 0.10N\n- Not interested: 20 students.\n\nSo the total interested students would be the sum of the three sports' students. Then the equation would be:\n\nFootball + Cricket + Basketball + Not interested = Total students\n\nWait, actually, the not interested are separate. So the sum of the interested students plus the 20 should equal the total. Wait, no, maybe the interested students plus the 20 not interested equals total. Wait, no, the interested students are those in the sports, and the 20 are not in any, so total is (sum of sports) + 20 = N.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the sum of the sports' percentages plus the 20 equals N. Let me think again.\n\nLet me write the equation properly:\n\nSum of percentages (as decimals) multiplied by N plus the 20 equals N.\n\nWait, no. Let me see:\n\nThe students interested in Football, Cricket, or Basketball plus those not interested equals the total. So,\n\n(0.08N + 0.8N + 0.10N) + 20 = N ?\n\nWait, but adding those three percentages: 0.08 + 0.8 + 0.1 = 0.98. So 0.98N plus 20 equals N?\n\nWait, that would mean 0.98N +20 = N. Then 20 = N -0.98N \u2192 20 =0.02N \u2192 so N=20/0.02 = 1000? But let me check the options. Option E is 1000. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscalculate.\n\nWait, let's do the math again. Let me check the fractions:\n\nFootball is 8% \u2192 0.08\n\nCricket is 4/5 \u2192 4 divided by 5 is 0.8, which is 80%.\n\nBasketball is 10% \u2192 0.10.\n\nAdding them up: 0.08 + 0.8 +0.10 = 0.98. So total interested in sports is 98% of N. So the remaining 2% (since 100% -98% =2%) would be the 20 students. \n\nAh! So 2% of N equals 20. \n\nSo 0.02*N =20 \u2192 N=20 /0.02 = 1000. So that would make the answer E)1000. But wait, the options include E as 1000. Hmm. But let me check the options again. The options given are A)850, B)800, C)900, D)950, E)1000. So that's possible. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the fractions. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, 4/5 of the total students are interested in Cricket. 4/5 is 80%, so yes. Then adding 8% +80% +10% =98%. So the remaining is 2%, which is 20 students. 2% of total is 20 \u2192 total is 20 divided by 0.02 =1000. So the answer is E. But wait, why are the other options there? Let me see if there's a possibility that the question meant that the students interested in the sports might have overlaps. But the problem doesn't state that. The question says \"interested in Football\", \"interested in Cricket\", etc. But unless it specifies that the students can't be in multiple categories, but the problem doesn't say they are mutually exclusive. Oh wait, that's a problem. Wait, but the question might be implying that the percentages are separate. Hmm, but in real scenarios, students can be interested in multiple sports, so adding them would give more than 100%, but here the sum is 98%, so maybe they are non-overlapping. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each student is interested in exactly one sport, so the percentages are non-overlapping. That's a common assumption in such problems unless stated otherwise. So in that case, the calculation holds. \n\nTherefore, the total number is 1000, which is option E. But wait, let me check again. The problem says \"remaining 20 students are not interested in any games.\" So the remaining after subtracting the sum of the three sports. So the calculation is correct. So the answer must be E.\n",

Hmm, the question is about finding the total number of students in a class based on their interests in different sports and those not interested. Let me parse the information again.\n\nSo, the problem states:\n\n- 8% of total students are interested in Football.\n- 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket. Wait, 4/5 is 80%, right?\n- 10% are into Basketball.\n- The remaining 20 students aren't interested in any games.\n\nThe question is asking for the total number of students. Let me denote the total number as T. \n\nAlright, so the idea here is that all the percentages (or fractions) add up to some portion of the students, and the rest are the 20 who aren't interested in any. So the sum of all the interested students plus the 20 should equal the total number of students. Let me write that out as an equation.\n\nFirst, let me convert all the given parts into fractions or percentages. \n\nFootball: 8% \u2192 0.08T\n\nCricket: 4/5 is 0.8, so that's 80% \u2192 0.8T\n\nBasketball: 10% \u2192 0.10T\n\nThe remaining students (those not interested) are 20. \n\nAdding up all the interested students: 0.08T (Football) + 0.8T (Cricket) + 0.10T (Basketball) = ?\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.08 + 0.8 = 0.88, plus 0.10 gives 0.98. So total interested students are 0.98T. \n\nWait, so the remaining students are T - 0.98T = 0.02T. And that's equal to 20 students. \n\nSo, 0.02T = 20. \n\nTo find T, we can solve for T: T = 20 / 0.02. \n\nCalculating that: 20 divided by 0.02 is the same as 20 multiplied by 50 (since 1/0.02 is 50). 20 *50 = 1000. \n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me check again. Because if the total interested is 98%, then 2% is 20 students. So 2% of T is 20. So T is 20 / 0.02 = 1000.

Adding those: 8+80=88, plus 10 gives 98. Yes, that's right. So the remaining is 2%, which is 20. So total is 1000. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Are there any overlaps? The problem says \"interested in Football\", \"interested in Cricket\", etc. But maybe some students are interested in more than one sport? The problem doesn't specify whether these groups are mutually exclusive. Hmm, that's a good point. \n\nWait, the problem might be assuming that each student is counted only once in their preferred sport. But the question says \"interested in Football\" etc., so maybe the percentages are exclusive. But if that's not the case, then the problem can't be solved. But since it's a math problem, I think they expect us to assume that the percentages add up without overlapping. Because otherwise, there's no way to know. \n\nSo, the question must be implying that the total percentage of students interested in at least one of the sports is 98%, so the remaining 2% are not interested in any. \n\nTherefore, the total students should be 1000, which is option E. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Let me see if any other option fits. Let me test with another option, just to be sure. \n\nSuppose the total was 800. Then 2% of 800 would be 16, but the problem says 20. So that's not. \n\nIf total is 900, 2% is 18, not 20. 950: 2% of 950 is 19. 850: 17. So only 1000 gives exactly 20. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be E)1000. \n\nHmm, I think that's solid.
