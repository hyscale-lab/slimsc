      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here: A cyclist is going at 12 miles per hour. The question is asking how many minutes it will take to travel 48 miles. The options are A through E, with numbers like 1, 240, 30, 60, and 120. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, I remember that time is equal to distance divided by speed. So the basic formula here would be time = distance / speed. The distance here is 48 miles, and the speed is 12 mph. So if I do 48 divided by 12, that should give me the time in hours. Let me calculate that. 48 divided by 12 is 4. Oh right, so that's 4 hours. But the question asks for the time in minutes, not hours. Oh right, I need to convert hours to minutes. \n\nWait, how do I convert hours to minutes again? There are 60 minutes in an hour. So if it's 4 hours, then multiply by 60. Let me do that: 4 times 60 is 240 minutes. So that would be 240 minutes. Let me check the options. Option B is 240. So the answer should be B, right?\n\nHold on, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me go through it again. The cyclist's speed is 12 mph. To find time in hours, it's 48/12 = 4 hours. Convert hours to minutes by multiplying by 60: 4 *60 = 240. Yep, that seems right. Let me check the options again. Option B is 240. The other options don't make sense. Like, 60 minutes would be 1 hour, which would only cover 12 miles. 120 minutes is 2 hours, which would be 24 miles. So 48 must take longer. So 240 is the correct one. I think that's it. So the answer must be B.\n",
