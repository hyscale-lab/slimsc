      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. Hmm, wait, the question says \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12\"\u2014so X must be a number that's divisible by both 9 and 12. But the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. Wait, maybe I need to rephrase that.\n\nLet me think. If X is divisible by 9 and 12, then X must be a common multiple of both 9 and 12. But actually, the smallest such number would be their least common multiple (LCM). So the LCM of 9 and 12. Let me calculate that. \n\nBreaking down into prime factors: 9 is 3\u00b2, and 12 is 2\u00b2\u00d73. The LCM takes the highest powers of all primes present. So that would be 2\u00b2 \u00d7 3\u00b2 = 4\u00d79 = 36. So the LCM of 9 and 12 is 36. Therefore, X must be a multiple of 36. But the question says \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X\"\u2014so which of the options is a multiple of X. But since X is a multiple of 36, the options must be a multiple of X. Wait, but X could be 36, 72, etc. But the options given are 36,15,17,5,7. So the only possible one here is 36, because if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of X (since it's equal to X). Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased as X is a number that is divisible by 9 and 12, so X's LCM is 36, so any multiple of X must be a multiple of 36. Therefore, which of the options is a multiple of 36? Looking at the options, only option A is 36. So that's the answer. Let me check again. The question says \"the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12\". Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting. The question is phrased as: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Maybe the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X, given that X is divisible by both 9 and 12. So X must be a multiple of LCM(9,12)=36, so X can be 36, 72, etc. The options are numbers, and we need to find which one is a multiple of X. Since X is at least 36, the only possible option that can be a multiple of X is if X is 36 and the option is 36. Because if X is 36, then 36 is a multiple of itself. But if X were larger, like 72, then none of the options would be multiples. So the only possible answer is A)36. The other options like 15, 17, etc., are smaller than 36 and can't be multiples of 36. So the answer must be A.\n",
