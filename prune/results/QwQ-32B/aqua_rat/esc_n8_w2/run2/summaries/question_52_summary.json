      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem says a man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2% of his income. We need to find his monthly income. Hmm, right. So, first, I should remember that the total income is the sum of his expenditure and savings. \n\nWait, the saving is 12.5% of his income. So, if I let his total income be, say, X rupees. Then his savings would be 12.5% of X, and the rest he spends. Since he spends 3500, that must be equal to the part of his income minus the savings. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of percentages. If he saves 12.5%, then he spends 100% - 12.5% = 87.5% of his income. Oh right, because the total income is 100%, so expenditure is the remaining after saving.\n\nSo, if 87.5% of his income equals Rs. 3500, then we can set up the equation. Let me write that down:\n\nLet total income = X.\n\nExpenditure = X - (12.5% of X) = 3500.\n\nAlternatively, since expenditure is 87.5% of X, then 87.5% of X is 3500. \n\nSo, 0.875 * X = 3500. To find X, divide 3500 by 0.875.\n\nHmm, calculating that. Let me see. Let's convert 87.5% to a decimal, which is 0.875. So 3500 divided by 0.875.\n\nHmm, 3500 divided by 0.875. Let me think. Maybe it's easier if I multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate the decimal. Wait, or maybe just do straight division. \n\nAlternatively, 0.875 is the same as 7/8. Because 7 divided by 8 is 0.875. Wait, 7 divided by 8 is 0.875? Let me check that. 7/8 is 0.875, yes. Because 1/8 is 0.125, so 7*0.125 is 0.875. Oh right. So 87.5% is 7/8. \n\nSo if 7/8 of X equals 3500, then X is 3500 multiplied by 8/7. \n\nCalculating that: 3500 divided by 7 is 500. So 500 multiplied by 8 is 4000. \n\nOh, so X is 4000. That would mean his monthly income is Rs. 4000. Let me check the options. Option C is 4000. So the answer should be C?\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. Let me go through the steps again to be sure. \n\nIf his income is 4000, then 12.5% of that is the savings. 12.5% is 1/8. So 4000 divided by 8 is 500. So he saves 500. Then his expenditure is 4000 - 500 = 3500. Which matches the given expenditure. So yes, that works. \n\nSo the correct answer must be C) Rs. 4000. Let me look at the options again. Option C is indeed 4000. So I think that's the right choice. The other options: D is 3937.50, which is close but not exactly. Probably a miscalculation if someone messed up the fractions. But according to the math here, C is correct.\n",
