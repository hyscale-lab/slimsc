      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a salesperson who gets a 10% commission on each sale. We need to find out how many sales of $250 each he must make to reach a salary of at least $1000. Hmm, right.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly the question is asking. The salary here probably refers to the total commission he earns. So he wants his total commission to be at least $1000. \n\nEach sale is $250, and he gets 10% of that as commission per sale. Let me calculate the commission per sale first. 10% of 250 is 0.10 * 250. Let me do that math: 0.1 times 250 equals 25. So each sale gives him $25 in commission. \n\nNow, he needs the total commission from all his sales to be at least $1000. Let's call the number of sales he needs 'x'. Then the total commission would be 25 times x. We need 25x \u2265 1000. \n\nTo find x, divide both sides by 25. So x \u2265 1000 /25. Let me calculate that: 1000 divided by 25 is 40. Wait, so 25 times 40 is exactly 1000. So he needs to make at least 40 sales. But hold on, the options are given as A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52. So D is 40. \n\nWait, but let me double-check. Let me think again. The question says \"at least $1000\". So if he makes exactly 40 sales, that gives him exactly 1000. So that meets the requirement. Therefore, the minimum number is 40. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 40, so that's the answer. Let me check if any other options could be possible. Let's see option E is 52, which would give more than 1000, but since the question asks for the minimum number needed to reach at least 1000, 40 is the smallest number that works. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me confirm the commission per sale again. 10% of 250: 0.10 *250=25. Yes. Then 25 per sale. 40 sales would be 40*25=1000. Exactly. So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the answer must be D)40. I don't see any other possible errors here. The options are straightforward. The key is that each sale contributes $25, so dividing 1000 by 25 gives the exact number. Since 40 is an option, that's the right choice.\n",

Probably, his total earnings from commissions should be at least $1000. Because otherwise, if he has a base salary plus commission, the problem would have mentioned that.
