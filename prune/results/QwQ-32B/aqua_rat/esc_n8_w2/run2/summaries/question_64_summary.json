      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about Sachin's batting average in the IPL season. His current average is 51, and after scoring 78 runs in the finals, his average becomes 54. We need to find the total number of matches he played this season.\n\nWait, right. Batting average is calculated as total runs divided by the number of innings (matches played, assuming he bats in every match). So let's denote some variables here. Let me think.\n\nLet the total number of matches played before the final be n. Then, his total runs before the final would be 51 multiplied by n, since average is total runs over matches. \n\nNow, in the final, he scores 78 runs. So after the final, his total runs become 51n +78. And the number of matches becomes n+1. The new average is 54, so:\n\n(51n +78)/(n+1) =54\n\nWe can set up this equation and solve for n. Then the total matches would be n+1. \n\nLet me do the algebra here. Multiply both sides by (n+1):\n\n51n +78 =54(n+1)\n\nExpanding the right side: 54n +54\n\nSo, 51n +78 =54n +54\n\nSubtract 51n from both sides: 78 =3n +54\n\nSubtract 54 from both sides: 24=3n \u2192 n=8\n\nSo the total matches would be n+1 =9. \n\nWait, so the answer is C)9. Let me check again to be sure.\n\nOriginal average:51 over n matches. After adding 78, total runs 51*8=408, plus 78 is 486. The total matches 9, so 486/9 =54. Yep, that works. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about Sachin's batting average in the IPL season. Hmm, I need to find out how many matches he played this season. Let me think step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that batting average is calculated by dividing the total runs scored by the number of times the batsman was out. But wait, sometimes the average is calculated over the number of matches, but I think it's usually runs divided by outs. Wait, but the question might be simplifying it as total runs divided by matches? Or maybe they are considering each match as an innings? Hmm, the problem might be treating it as runs divided by matches, but I need to check.\n\nWait, the standard formula for batting average is total runs divided by total number of dismissals (not outs in every match, because sometimes a batsman might not get out in a match). But maybe in this problem, they are assuming that he was out in every match, so the number of dismissals is equal to the number of matches played. That might be an assumption here. Let me see.\n\nThe question says that currently, his average is 51. Then in the final match, he scores 78 runs, and his average becomes 54. We have to find the number of matches he played in the season. Let me set up variables.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of matches he has played before the final as n. So, total runs before the final would be 51 * n, assuming that each match he was out once. Then, after the final, he plays one more match, so total matches become n+1. His total runs would be 51n +78. The new average is 54, so:\n\n(51n +78)/(n+1) =54.\n\nWait, that's the equation if the average is total runs divided by number of matches. Wait but if the average is calculated as runs divided by dismissals, and if he wasn't out in the final, then the denominator would be n (if he was out in all previous matches) plus 0 if not out. But the problem might be simplifying it to average per match, assuming he was out each time, so each match counts as a dismissal. So the problem might be using average = total runs / number of matches. Let me proceed with that assumption because otherwise, there's not enough information. Let me try that equation.\n\nSo solving (51n +78) / (n+1) =54.\n\nMultiply both sides by (n+1):\n\n51n +78 =54(n+1)\n\nExpand the right side: 54n +54\n\nSo 51n +78 =54n +54\n\nSubtract 51n both sides: 78 =3n +54\n\nSubtract 54: 24 =3n \u2192 n=8.\n\nSo the number of matches before the final is 8, then adding the final, total matches would be 9. Wait but the question is asking for the total number of matches played in the season. Wait the final is part of the season, so the total is n+1 =8+1=9. So the answer would be C)9?\n\nWait let me check again. Let me go through the steps again. Let me see the calculation:\n\nEquation again: (51n +78) / (n+1) =54\n\nMultiply out:\n\n51n +78 =54n +54\n\n78-54 =54n -51n \u2192 24=3n \u2192 n=8. So the total matches is 8+1=9. So yes, option C is 9. That's one of the choices. So the answer should be C.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering that in the final match, he was out, so the number of dismissals increases by 1. Wait, but if that's the case, then the original average would be total runs divided by number of dismissals. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose before the final, he has played n matches, and was out in all, so dismissals are n. His average is total runs / n =51 \u2192 total runs =51n. In the final, he scores 78 runs and gets out. So dismissals become n+1, total runs 51n+78. New average is (51n +78)/(n+1) =54. Which is the same equation as before. So same answer. So whether it's matches or dismissals, as long as the dismissals are equal to the number of matches (assuming he was out in each), then the equation holds. So the answer is 9, option C.\n\nAlternatively, if he didn't get out in the final, then the dismissals would remain n, so the average would be (51n +78)/n =54. Then solving 51n +78 =54n \u2192 78=3n \u2192n=26. Then total matches would be 26 +1=27, which is not an option. So that scenario is not possible. Hence, the first assumption must be correct. So the answer is 9, option C. So the correct answer is C.\n",
