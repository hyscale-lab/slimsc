      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about a sporting goods store that sells golf balls. They have yellow and white ones. At the beginning of the day, they had 600 total. Then by the end, they sold 80% of their inventory. Hmm. And the key points are that they sold an equal number of each color, and that they sold all of their white balls. The question is asking how many yellow golf balls did they have at the beginning.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. Let me start by writing down what I know. The total number of balls at the start was 600. Let me denote the number of yellow balls as Y and white as W. So Y + W = 600. That's equation one.\n\nThey sold 80% of their inventory. So total sold would be 80% of 600. Let me calculate that. 80% of 600 is 0.8 * 600 = 480. So they sold 480 balls total during the day.\n\nNow, the problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls. So the number of yellow sold equals the number of white sold. Let me call the number of each sold as S. So yellow sold is S, white sold is S. So total sold is S + S = 2S. And that's equal to 480. So 2S = 480 \u2192 S = 240. So they sold 240 white and 240 yellow balls?\n\nWait, but the problem also says that in doing so, they sold all of their white golf balls. Oh right! So that means that the number of white balls they had in stock was exactly equal to the number sold. Because they sold all of them. So the white inventory W was sold entirely, so W = 240. Because they sold all white balls, which was S = 240. So W is 240.\n\nThen since Y + W = 600, substituting W gives Y = 600 - 240 = 360. Wait, but that would mean the answer is E) 360? But hold on a second. Wait, but if they started with 360 yellow and 240 white, then they sold all the white (240) and 240 yellow. So the total sold is 480, which matches the 80%. \n\nBut then the question is asking for the number of yellow balls they had at the beginning, which would be 360. But let me check the options. Option E is 360. Hmm. But wait, let me think again. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Because if they started with 360 yellow, and sold 240, then the remaining yellow would be 120. But the problem didn't say anything about the remaining yellow. Wait, but the problem states that they sold all of the white balls, so white is gone. So the remaining inventory is the unsold yellow. \n\nLet me see. The total sold is 80% so 480. So the remaining is 20% of 600, which is 120. That remaining must all be yellow, since all white were sold. So the remaining yellow is 120. Which would mean that initial yellow minus sold yellow (240) equals 120. So Y - 240 = 120 \u2192 Y = 360. That checks out. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are A)80, B)120, C)240, D)320, E)360. So E would be correct. But let me check again to be sure I didn't flip anything.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me rephrase variables. Let Y be initial yellow, W initial white. So Y + W = 600. Sold total is 480. \n\nThey sold equal numbers of each color, so sold Y_sold = W_sold. Also, all white were sold, so W_sold = W. Therefore, Y_sold = W. So total sold is Y_sold + W_sold = W + W = 2W = 480. Therefore 2W =480 \u2192 W=240. So Y is 600 -240 = 360. So that's the same as before. So answer E.\n\nWait but wait a second. The problem says they sold an equal number of yellow and white. So the number of yellow sold equals white sold. But if all the white were sold, then white sold is W. So yellow sold must also be W. So total sold is W + W = 2W. Which equals 480, so W is 240. So Y = 360. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is E. \n\nBut wait, looking at the options, I see that one of the options is 360. So that's E. Hmm. But let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial equations?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe store sold 80% of its inventory. So total sold is 80% of 600 is 480. Correct. \n\nSold an equal number of each color. So sold Y_sold = W_sold. \n\nSold all of its white golf balls. Therefore, W_sold = W. So Y_sold must equal W. \n\nTotal sold: Y_sold + W_sold = W + W = 2W = 480 \u2192 W = 240. Thus, initial Y is 600-240 = 360. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is E.\n\nWait, but why is one of the options 320? Maybe I made a mistake. Let me see another way.\n\nSuppose that the store had Y yellow and W white. So Y + W =600. \n\nThey sold 80% of their inventory (so 480 balls). The number of yellow sold plus white sold is 480. \n\nThey sold equal numbers of each, so Y_sold = W_sold. Let that number be S. So 2S =480 \u2192 S=240. \n\nSo they sold 240 white and 240 yellow. \n\nBut they sold all their white balls. Therefore, the original number of white was 240. \n\nTherefore original yellow was 600-240=360. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be E. \n\nHmm. So that's consistent. I think that's correct. So the answer is E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nOkay, let's break down the problem step by step. The store starts with 600 golf balls, a mix of yellow (Y) and white (W). So, the first equation is:\n\n**Y + W = 600**.\n\nThey sold 80% of their inventory, which is **0.8 \u00d7 600 = 480 balls**. The problem states they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls. Let the number sold of each color be **S**. Thus:\n\n**S (yellow sold) + S (white sold) = 480**  \n\u2192 **2S = 480**  \n\u2192 **S = 240**.\n\nSince all white balls were sold, the total white balls initially (**W**) must equal the number sold (**S = 240**). Therefore:\n\n**W = 240**.\n\nSubstituting into the first equation:  \n**Y + 240 = 600**  \n\u2192 **Y = 360**.\n\nThe remaining yellow balls not sold are **Y - S = 360 - 240 = 120**, which matches the remaining 20% (120 balls) of inventory. This confirms consistency.\n\nThus, the number of yellow golf balls the store had initially is **360**.\n\nAnswer: E",
