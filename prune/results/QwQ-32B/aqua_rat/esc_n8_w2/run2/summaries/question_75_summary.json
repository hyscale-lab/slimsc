      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the total length of a picket fence. Hmm, so each picket is 1/2 inch wide, and there's 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. The question is asking for the length in feet. Alright, so I need to convert inches to feet at some point since the answer options are in fractions that might imply feet.\n\nFirst, let me think about how the pickets and spaces are arranged. If there are x pickets, then the number of spaces between them would be one less than the number of pickets. Like, if there are two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, it's x - 1 spaces. Right, that's important.\n\nSo the total width contributed by the pickets themselves would be the number of pickets multiplied by each picket's width. Each picket is 1/2 inch. So that's x * (1/2) inches.\n\nThen, the spaces between them: each space is 6 inches, and there are (x -1) spaces. So that's 6*(x -1) inches.\n\nAdding those two parts together gives the total length in inches. Then I need to convert that to feet because the answer options are in feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I'll divide the total inches by 12 to get feet.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nTotal length in inches = (x*(1/2)) + 6*(x -1)\n\nLet me write that as an equation:\n\nTotal inches = 0.5x + 6(x - 1)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n0.5x + 6x - 6 = (0.5x +6x) = 6.5x, then subtract 6. So 6.5x -6 inches total.\n\nWait, 6.5x is the same as 13x/2. Because 6.5 is 13/2. So 13x/2 -6 inches.\n\nBut the question asks for the length in feet. So I need to convert inches to feet. To do that, divide by 12.\n\nSo total feet = (13x/2 -6) /12. Let me see how to write that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor it differently. Let me compute:\n\nTotal inches is ( (13x/2 ) -6 ) inches. To convert to feet, divide by 12:\n\nTotal feet = (13x/2 -6)/12. Let's combine the terms over a common denominator. Let me write this as:\n\n= (13x/2 - 6* (2/2) ) /12\n\nWait, that's (13x -12)/2 divided by 12. Hmm, perhaps better to write numerator as (13x -12)/2, then divided by 12 gives (13x-12)/(2*12) = (13x-12)/24. Oh, right. Because:\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me write 13x/2 -6 as (13x -12)/2. Because 6 is 12/2, so:\n\n13x/2 -12/2 = (13x -12)/2. Then divide that by 12 to get feet:\n\nSo [(13x-12)/2] /12 = (13x-12)/(24). \n\nSo the total length in feet is (13x -12)/24. Looking at the options, that's option E. Let me check the options again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)13x/2\n\nB)13x/2 -6\n\nC)13x/24\n\nD)(13x+1)/24\n\nE)(13x-12)/24\n\nYes, E matches what I got. Let me verify once again step by step to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nNumber of pickets: x. Each is 0.5 inches. So total picket width: 0.5x inches.\n\nNumber of spaces between pickets is x-1. Each space is 6 inches. So total space is 6(x-1) inches.\n\nTotal length in inches: 0.5x +6(x-1) =0.5x +6x -6 =6.5x -6. 6.5 is 13/2, so (13/2)x -6. \n\nConvert to feet: divide by 12. So [(13x/2 -6)] /12. Let's write this as:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 1 to get a single fraction. Let me think:\n\nAlternatively, let me compute each part:\n\nThe 0.5x inches is (0.5x)/12 feet, and the 6(x-1) inches is 6(x-1)/12 feet. Wait, maybe another approach:\n\nAlternatively, converting each component to feet first:\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches, so in feet that's 0.5/12 feet. Each space is 6 inches, which is 6/12 = 0.5 feet.\n\nWait, maybe that's an easier way. Let me try this again using feet from the start.\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches. To convert to feet, 0.5 inches is 0.5/12 feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches. So 0.5 inches is (1/24) feet. Because 0.5 divided by 12 is 0.5/12 = 1/24.\n\nSimilarly, each space is 6 inches, which is 6/12 = 0.5 feet, or 1/2 feet.\n\nSo total length in feet would be:\n\nNumber of pickets (x) times their width (1/24) plus the number of spaces (x-1) times their width (1/2). \n\nSo:\n\nTotal = x*(1/24) + (x-1)*(1/2)\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst term: x/24\n\nSecond term: (x-1)/2\n\nTo add them together, need a common denominator. Let's convert x/24 to x/24, and (x-1)/2 is 12(x-1)/24.\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute each part:\n\nTotal = (x/24) + [(x-1)/2]\n\nLet me compute:\n\nLet me write the second term as (x-1)/2 = (x-1)*12/24. Wait maybe I can combine them:\n\nTotal = [x + 12(x-1)] /24 ?\n\nWait yes, because:\n\nThe first term is x/24, the second term is (x-1)/2 = (x-1)*12/24. So adding them together:\n\n[ x + 12(x-1) ] /24 \n\n= [x +12x -12 ] /24 \n\n= (13x -12)/24 \n\nWhich is exactly what I got before. So that's the same as option E. \n\nSo that's consistent. So the correct answer is E.\n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the number of spaces. For x pickets, spaces are between them, so x-1. So that's correct. \n\nLet me think of an example. Suppose there are 2 pickets. Then:\n\nEach picket is 0.5 inches. So total picket width is 1 inch. The space between them is 6 inches. So total length is 1 +6 =7 inches. \n\nIn feet, that would be 7/12 feet.\n\nNow plug into the formula for E: (13x-12)/24. Let x=2:\n\n(26-12)/24 =14/24 =7/12. Which matches. \n\nAnother example: x=1. Then there's one picket. No space. So total length is 0.5 inches. \n\nPlugging into E: (13*1 -12)/24 = (1)/24. 1/24 feet. Since 0.5 inches is 0.5/12 = 1/24 feet. Correct. \n\nIf x=3, pickets: 3*(0.5) =1.5 inches, spaces: 2*6=12. Total 13.5 inches, which is 13.5/12 = 1.125 feet. \n\nFormula E: (13*3 -12)/24 \u2192 (39-12)=27 \u2192 27/24 = 1.125. Correct. \n\nSo that's working. So I think E is correct. Let me check the other options to make sure.\n\nOption B is 13x/2 -6, which would be in inches before converting to feet. Since the question asks for feet, so that's not the right unit. So B is wrong.\n\nOption C is 13x/24. That would be if there were no spaces, but only the pickets. But the example with x=2 would give (13*2)/24 =26/24 \u22481.08 feet, but actual is 7/12\u22480.58, so that's way off. So no.\n\nOption D: (13x+1)/24. For x=2, that would be 27/24=1.125, but correct is 7/12. So nope.\n\nSo definitely E is the right one.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out the length of the fence in feet based on the given information. The fence has x pickets, each 1/2 inch wide. And between each pair of pickets, there's 6 inches of space. Hmm, so first, I should probably calculate the total width taken up by the pickets and the spaces between them, then convert that into feet.\n\nWait, right. Each picket is 1/2 inch. So for x pickets, that would be (1/2)*x inches. But then the spaces between them. Since the pickets are arranged in a straight line, the number of spaces between them would be one less than the number of pickets. Like if there are two pickets, there's one space between them. So for x pickets, the number of spaces is (x-1). Each space is 6 inches. So the total space between pickets is 6*(x-1) inches.\n\nSo total length of the fence in inches would be the sum of the pickets and the spaces. That would be (1/2)x + 6(x - 1). Let me write that out:\n\nTotal length (inches) = (0.5x) + 6(x - 1).\n\nNow I need to convert that into feet because the question asks for the length in feet. Since 1 foot is 12 inches, I have to divide the total inches by 12.\n\nSo first, let me simplify the expression. Let's compute the total inches:\n\n0.5x +6x -6 = (0.5 +6)x -6. Wait, 0.5 +6 is 6.5, which is 13/2. So 13/2 x minus 6. So total inches are (13x/2 -6). \n\nThen, converting to feet: (13x/2 -6)/12. To write this as a single fraction, maybe I can combine the terms. Let's see:\n\n(13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x/2)/(12) -6/12. That's (13x)/(24) - 0.5. Hmm, but none of the options look exactly like that. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the total inches again. \n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch, so x pickets: 0.5x inches. The spaces between each pair are 6 inches each. Since there are (x-1) spaces, so 6*(x-1) inches. So total length in inches is 0.5x +6(x-1). Let me expand that: 0.5x +6x -6. So that's (0.5x +6x) =6.5x, so 6.5x -6. 6.5 is 13/2, so 13x/2 -6. That's correct. So total inches is (13x/2 -6). \n\nThen converting to feet: divide by 12. So (13x/2 -6)/12. Let me write this as a single fraction:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator appropriately. Let's get a common denominator for the terms in the numerator. Let's see:\n\n13x/2 -6 = (13x -12)/2. Because 6 is 12/2. So 13x/2 -12/2 = (13x-12)/2. Then dividing by 12 gives [(13x-12)/2]/12 = (13x -12)/(24). \n\nAh, that's better! So that simplifies to (13x -12)/24. Which is option E. Let me check the options again. \n\nOptions are:\n\nA)13x/2 \u2192 that's in inches, not feet, and no subtraction. So no.\n\nB)13x/2 -6 \u2192 also inches, same problem.\n\nC)13x/24 \u2192 Hmm, if you just take 13x/2 divided by 12, that's 13x/24, but that's missing the -6 part. \n\nWait, so when I converted to feet, I had to do the entire expression (13x/2 -6)/12. Which becomes (13x -12)/24. Because when you factor out the 1/2 from the numerator, then divided by 12. Let me see:\n\nOriginal numerator: (13x/2 -6) = (13x -12)/2. Then divide by 12, so multiply by 1/12: (13x-12)/(2*12) = (13x-12)/24. Exactly. So that's option E. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nE is (13x-12)/24. That's correct. Let me check if any other options could be similar. D is (13x+1)/24, which is not. So the answer must be E.\n",

Let's see:\n\n(13x/2 -6)/12 = (13x/2)/(12) -6/12. That's (13x)/(24) - 0.5. Hmm, but none of the options look exactly like that. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate the total inches again. \n\nEach picket is 1/2 inch, so x pickets: 0.5x inches. The spaces between each pair are 6 inches each. Since there are (x-1) spaces, so 6*(x-1) inches. So total length in inches is 0.5x +6(x-1). Let me expand that: 0.5x +6x -6. So that's (0.5x +6x) =6.5x, so 6.5x -6. 6.5 is 13/2, so 13x/2 -6. That's correct. So total inches is (13x/2 -6). \n\nThen converting to feet: divide by 12. So (13x/2 -6)/12. Let me write this as a single fraction:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator appropriately. Let's get a common denominator for the terms in the numerator. Let's see:\n\n13x/2 -6 = (13x -12)/2. Because 6 is 12/2. So 13x/2 -12/2 = (13x-12)/2. Then dividing by 12 gives [(13x-12)/2]/12 = (13x -12)/(24). \n\nAh, that's better! So that simplifies to (13x -12)/24. Which is option E. Let me check the options again. \n\nOptions are:\n\nA)13x/2 \u2192 that's in inches, not feet, and no subtraction. So no.\n\nB)13x/2 -6 \u2192 also inches, same problem.\n\nC)13x/24 \u2192 Hmm, if you just take 13x/2 divided by 12, that's 13x/24, but that's missing the -6 part. \n\nWait, so when I converted to feet, I had to do the entire expression (13x/2 -6)/12. Which becomes (13x -12)/24. Because when you factor out the 1/2 from the numerator, then divided by 12. Let me see:\n\nOriginal numerator: (13x/2 -6) = (13x -12)/2. Then divide by 12, so multiply by 1/12: (13x-12)/(2*12) = (13x-12)/24. Exactly. So that's option E. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nE is (13x-12)/24. That's correct. Let me check if any other options could be similar. D is (13x+1)/24, which is not. So the answer must be E.\n\n\nTo determine the length of the fence in feet, we first calculate the total length in inches. Each picket is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) inch wide, so the total width of \\( x \\) pickets is \\( \\frac{1}{2}x \\) inches. The spaces between the pickets are 6 inches each, and there are \\( x - 1 \\) spaces (since each space is between two adjacent pickets). Thus, the total space between pickets is \\( 6(x - 1) \\) inches. \n\nAdding these together, the total length in inches is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x + 6(x - 1)\n\\]\nSimplifying this expression:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}x + 6x - 6 = \\left(\\frac{1}{2} + 6\\right)x - 6 = \\frac{13}{2}x - 6\n\\]\nTo convert inches to feet, divide by 12:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{13}{2}x - 6}{12}\n\\]\nExpressing this as a single fraction, rewrite the numerator:\n\\[\n\\frac{13x - 12}{2} \\div 12 = \\frac{13x - 12}{24}\n\\]\nThus, the length of the fence in feet is \\( \\frac{13x - 12}{24} \\), which corresponds to option **E**.\n\nAnswer: E",
