      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Arjun and Sajal having some money. There are two scenarios here: one where Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, and another where Sajal gives $10 to Arjun. Each scenario leads to a certain ratio of their remaining money. I need to figure out how much each of them originally has.\n\nHmm, first, maybe I should assign variables to their current amounts. Let's say Arjun has A dollars and Sajal has S dollars. Then I can set up equations based on the problem's conditions.\n\nThe first condition: If Arun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun. Wait, wait, Arun? Oh, maybe that's a typo and they meant Arjun. Because the names given are Arjun and Sajal. So assuming that's correct, let's proceed.\n\nSo after Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Arjun will have A - 30 left. And Sajal will have S + 30. According to the problem, in this case, Sajal's amount is twice Arjun's remaining. So equation one would be:\n\nS + 30 = 2*(A - 30)\n\nThat's the first equation.\n\nThe second condition: If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, then Arjun will have thrice as much as Sajal has left. So in this scenario, Sajal gives away $10, so Sajal has S - 10, and Arjun has A + 10. Then Arjun's amount is three times Sajal's. So equation two is:\n\nA + 10 = 3*(S - 10)\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. Let me write them again:\n\n1) S + 30 = 2(A - 30)\n2) A + 10 = 3(S - 10)\n\nI need to solve these equations. Let me rearrange them first.\n\nStarting with equation 1:\nS + 30 = 2A - 60\nSo S = 2A - 60 -30 \u2192 S = 2A -90\n\nEquation 2:\nA +10 = 3S -30\nSo A = 3S -30 -10 \u2192 A = 3S -40\n\nNow substitute S from equation 1 into equation 2. Wait, equation 1 gives S in terms of A, so maybe substitute equation 1's S into equation 2's equation.\n\nWait, equation 2 is written as A = 3S -40. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, substitute S from equation 1 into equation 2.\n\nSo equation 2: A +10 = 3*(S -10)\n\nBut S is 2A -90, so substitute:\n\nA +10 = 3*( (2A -90) -10 )\n= 3*(2A -100)\n= 6A - 300\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\nA +10 =6A -300\n\nSubtract A from both sides:\n\n10 =5A -300\n\nAdd 300:\n\n310 =5A \u2192 A= 310/5 =62.\n\nSo Arjun has 62 dollars.\n\nThen, from equation 1, S =2*62 -90 =124-90=34.\n\nWait, so Sajal has 34. Let me check the options. The options are A)62,35; B)62,34; C)34,62; D)42,62; E)62,42.\n\nSo that would be option B) 62,34. Let me verify both conditions.\n\nFirst scenario: Arjun gives 30 to Sajal. Arjun has 62-30=32, Sajal has 34+30=64. Is 64 twice 32? Yes, that's correct.\n\nSecond scenario: Sajal gives 10 to Arjun. Sajal has 34-10=24, Arjun has 62+10=72. 72 should be thrice 24. 3*24 is 72. Correct again. So the answer must be B.\n\nWait but let me check the options again. Option B is (62,34). So that's Arjun first, Sajal second. The options are written as (Arjun, Sajal), I assume. The problem says \"how much money does each have?\" in the order Arjun and Sajal. So yes, that's correct. So the answer is B.\n",

Alright, let me start by assigning variables to their amounts.

Wait, the question mentions Arun, but the names are Arjun and Sajal. Maybe that's a typo? Like maybe it's supposed to be Arjun? Because the question is about Arjun and Sajal. So assuming that, so if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, then Sajal's money becomes twice what Arjun has left. \n\nSo, after giving $30, Arjun has A - 30 left. Sajal has S +30.
