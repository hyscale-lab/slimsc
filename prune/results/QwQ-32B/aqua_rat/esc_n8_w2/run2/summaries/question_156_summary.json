      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about finding the number of consecutive integers, k, that add up to 51. The smallest integer in this sequence is -50. Hmm, I need to figure out how many terms there are here. \n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they are consecutive, the common difference is 1. The formula for the sum S of k terms starting from a first term a1 and ending at ak is S = k*(a1 + ak)/2. Alternatively, since they are consecutive, the last term can be written as a1 + (k-1)*d, but here d is 1, so the last term is a1 + k -1. \n\nWait, in this case, the first term is given as -50. So the sequence starts at -50 and has k terms. The last term would then be -50 + (k-1). The sum would be the average of the first and last term multiplied by the number of terms. So substituting into the formula, the sum S is k*(-50 + (-50 + k -1))/2. That's supposed to equal 51. Let me write that equation down properly.\n\nLet me set up the equation step by step. The sum S is given by:\nS = k/2 [2a1 + (k-1)d]\nSince the difference d is 1, this simplifies to:\nS = k/2 [2*(-50) + (k-1)*1]\nSo plugging in S =51:\n51 = k/2 [ -100 + k -1 ]\nSimplify inside the brackets: -100 -1 is -101, so:\n51 = (k/2)(k -101)\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n102 = k(k -101)\nWhich becomes the quadratic equation:\nk\u00b2 -101k -102 =0\nWait, hold on, let me check that again. Wait, 51*2 is 102. So the equation after multiplying is 102 = k(k -101). So expanding the right side gives k\u00b2 -101k = 102. Then moving everything to one side gives k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0. \n\nHmm, solving this quadratic equation. Let me try factoring. Let's see, I need two numbers that multiply to -102 and add up to -101. Wait, the factors of 102 are 1 & 102, 2&51, 3&34, 6&17. Since the product is -102, one is positive and the other is negative. Let me see: suppose the numbers are -102 and +1. Then their product is -102 and their sum would be (-102)+1 = -101. Yes! That works. So the quadratic factors as (k -102)(k +1) =0. \n\nSo the solutions are k=102 or k= -1. Since k can't be negative, we take k=102. But wait, the options include 102 as option E. But let me check the options again. The options are A)40, B)62, C)82, D)92, E)102. So E would be the answer here. \n\nWait, but let me verify this because sometimes when setting up equations, mistakes can happen. Let me double-check the steps. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use another approach. The sequence starts at -50 and has k terms. The terms are -50, -49, ..., up to (-50 +k-1). The sum of these numbers is 51. \n\nAlternatively, the sum can be thought of as the sum from n = -50 to n = (-50 +k-1). Let me think of the sum of integers from a to b is (b -a +1)*(a + b)/2. Here a is -50 and b is (-50 +k-1). The number of terms is k, so that part is okay. \n\nSo the sum would be k*(-50 + (-50 +k -1))/2 =51. That's exactly the same equation as before, so the solution is still k=102. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's an error in assuming the last term. Let me think: the first term is -50, then the next is -49, so the nth term is -50 + (n-1). So when there are k terms, the last term is -50 + (k-1). So yes, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe plug in the answer options to check. Let me try option E, which is 102. Let's see, if k is 102, then the last term is -50 + 101 =51. Wait, the last term would be -50 + (102-1) = -50 +101 =51. Then the sum would be (number of terms)*(first + last)/2. So 102*(-50 +51)/2 = 102*(1)/2 =51. Exactly matches the required sum. So that works. \n\nSo that seems correct. Let me check another option to see if any others might work. Let's try option D, 92. Then the last term would be -50 +91 =41. The sum would be 92*(-50 +41)/2. The numerator inside is -9, so 92*(-9)/2= 92*(-4.5)= -414, which is way off. \n\nOption C is 82: last term is -50 +81=31. Sum would be 82*(-50 +31)/2 =82*(-19)/2 = -82*9.5= -779, nope. \n\nOption B:62 terms. Last term is -50 +61 =11. Sum is 62*(-50+11)/2 =62*(-39)/2= 62*(-19.5)= -1210.5. Not 51. \n\nA)40 terms. Last term is -50 +39= -11. Sum is 40*(-50-11)/2 =40*(-61)/2 = -1220. Not 51. \n\nSo only option E gives the correct sum. Therefore, the answer must be E)102.\n",

Hmm, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the sum of consecutive integers can be calculated using the formula for an arithmetic series. Since they are consecutive, the difference between each term is 1. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is (number of terms)/2 multiplied by (first term + last term). So, Sum = (k/2) * (a1 + ak), where a1 is the first term and ak is the last term. \n\nIn this case, the first term a1 is given as -50. The last term would be the first term plus (k-1) because each term increases by 1. So, the last term ak = -50 + (k -1). \n\nThe problem states that the sum is 51. Plugging into the formula: \n\n51 = (k/2) * [ -50 + (-50 + (k-1)) ]\n\nLet me simplify the expression inside the brackets first. Let's compute the terms inside:\n\n-50 + (-50 + k -1) = -50 -50 +k -1 = ( -101 +k )\n\nSo substituting back into the equation:\n\n51 = (k/2) * (k - 101)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction:\n\n102 = k(k - 101)\n\nExpanding the right side gives:\n\n102 = k\u00b2 - 101k\n\nBring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:\n\nk\u00b2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\nHmm, now I need to solve this quadratic equation. Let's see if I can factor it. The quadratic is k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0. Let me look for two numbers that multiply to -102 and add to -101. Wait, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe I should use the quadratic formula. \n\nQuadratic formula is k = [101 \u00b1 sqrt( (101)^2 +4*1*102 ) ]/(2*1)\n\nCalculating discriminant first:\n\nDiscriminant D = (101)^2 +4*1*102. Let me compute 101 squared first. 100 squared is 10000, so 101 squared is 10201. Then adding 4*102=408, so total D is 10201 + 408 = 10609. \n\nWhat's the square root of 10609? Hmm, let me think. 100 squared is 10000, 103 squared is 10609 (since 100^2 is 10000, 103^2 is (100+3)^2 = 10000 + 600 +9=10609). So sqrt(10609) is 103. \n\nSo the solutions are:\n\nk = [101 \u00b1103]/2 \n\nSo two possibilities:\n\nFirst solution: (101 +103)/2 = 204/2 = 102\n\nSecond solution: (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1 \n\nBut since the number of terms can't be negative, we discard -1. So k=102. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 102. So that's the answer? Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when setting up equations, mistakes can happen.\n\nWait, let me re-verify the setup. The first term is -50, and there are k terms. The last term is -50 + (k-1)*1 = -50 +k -1 =k-51. \n\nSo the sum should be (k/2)*(first + last) = (k/2)*(-50 + (k-51)). Let me compute that again. \n\nWait, -50 + (k-51) is indeed (k -101). So that part was correct. \n\nSo the equation is correct. So the quadratic gives k=102. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 102. So that's the answer. \n\nBut let me check with another approach to be sure. Maybe by considering the sequence from -50 up to some number, and summing them to 51. \n\nAlternatively, the sum of numbers from -50 to n (inclusive) where the total is 51. Wait, how many terms are there from -50 to n? The count would be (n - (-50) ) +1 = n +51. \n\nThe sum from -50 to n is equal to the sum from 1 to n minus the sum from 1 to -51 (but that might complicate). Alternatively, perhaps using the formula again. \n\nAlternatively, the average multiplied by the number of terms equals the sum. The average of the sequence is (first + last)/2, so ( -50 + (last) ) /2. Multiply by k terms gives the sum 51. \n\nSo ( (last -50)/2 ) *k =51. But last term is -50 + (k-1), so substituting that in gives the same equation again. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the sequence starting at -50 and ending at some number x. The number of terms is (x - (-50) ) +1 = x +51. \n\nThe sum is (x + (-50))/2 * (x+51) =51. \n\nLet me set variables again. Let me let k = x +51, so x =k -51. Then the sum would be ( (k-51 -50)/2 ) *k = ( (k-101)/2 ) *k =51. Which is exactly the same equation as before. So solving gives k=102. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be E)102. \n\nBut wait, let me test with an example. Suppose k=102. Then the last term is -50 +101 =51. So the numbers go from -50 to 51 inclusive. The number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1 = 102. \n\nSum is ( -50 +51 ) *102 /2 = (1)*51 =51. Oh wait, that's exactly the sum given. \n\nWait, that works perfectly. The sum from -50 to 51. Let me compute that. The first term is -50, last term is 51. The average is ( -50 +51 )/2 = 0.5. The number of terms is 102. So 0.5 *102=51. Exactly. \n\nSo that's correct. Therefore, the answer is E. \n\nHmm, so why are there other options? Let me check if maybe I made an error in the quadratic solution. Let me recheck that step. \n\nOriginal equation: 51 = (k/2)(k-101). Multiply by 2: 102 =k(k-101). Then k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0. \n\nYes, that's correct. Then discriminant is (101)^2 +4*1*102. 101 squared is 10201, plus 408 gives 10609. Square root of that is 103. \n\nSo 101+103 is 204, divided by 2 gives 102. \n\nSo all steps check out. Therefore the correct answer is E.\n",

So sqrt(10609) is 103. \n\nSo the solutions are:\n\nk = [101 \u00b1103]/2 \n\nSo two possibilities:\n\nFirst solution: (101 +103)/2 = 204/2 = 102\n\nSecond solution: (101 -103)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1 \n\nBut since the number of terms can't be negative, we discard -1. So k=102. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 102. So that's the answer? Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when setting up equations, mistakes can happen.\n\nWait, let me re-verify the setup. The first term is -50, and there are k terms. The last term is -50 + (k-1)*1 = -50 +k -1 =k-51. \n\nSo the sum should be (k/2)*(first + last) = (k/2)*(-50 + (k-51)). Let me compute that again. \n\nWait, -50 + (k-51) is indeed (k -101). So that part was correct. \n\nSo the equation is correct. So the quadratic gives k=102. \n\nLooking at the options, E is 102. So that's the answer. \n\nBut let me check with another approach to be sure. Maybe by considering the sequence from -50 up to some number, and summing them to 51. \n\nAlternatively, the sum of numbers from -50 to n (inclusive) where the total is 51. Wait, how many terms are there from -50 to n? The count would be (n - (-50) ) +1 = n +51. \n\nThe sum from -50 to n is equal to the sum from 1 to n minus the sum from 1 to -51 (but that might complicate). Alternatively, perhaps using the formula again. \n\nAlternatively, the average multiplied by the number of terms equals the sum. The average of the sequence is (first + last)/2, so ( -50 + (last) ) /2. Multiply by k terms gives the sum 51. \n\nSo ( (last -50)/2 ) *k =51. But last term is -50 + (k-1), so substituting that in gives the same equation again. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe I can think of the sequence starting at -50 and ending at some number x. The number of terms is (x - (-50) ) +1 = x +51. \n\nThe sum is (x + (-50))/2 * (x+51) =51. \n\nLet me set variables again. Let me let k = x +51, so x =k -51. Then the sum would be ( (k-51 -50)/2 ) *k = ( (k-101)/2 ) *k =51. Which is exactly the same equation as before. So solving gives k=102. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be E)102. \n\nBut wait, let me test with an example. Suppose k=102. Then the last term is -50 +101 =51. So the numbers go from -50 to 51 inclusive. The number of terms is 51 - (-50) +1 = 102. \n\nSum is ( -50 +51 ) *102 /2 = (1)*51 =51. Oh wait, that's exactly the sum given. \n\nWait, that works perfectly. The sum from -50 to 51. Let me compute that. The first term is -50, last term is 51. The average is ( -50 +51 )/2 = 0.5. The number of terms is 102. So 0.5 *102=51. Exactly. \n\nSo that's correct. Therefore, the answer is E. \n\nHmm, so why are there other options? Let me check if maybe I made an error in the quadratic solution. Let me recheck that step. \n\nOriginal equation: 51 = (k/2)(k-101). Multiply by 2: 102 =k(k-101). Then k\u00b2 -101k -102 =0. \n\nYes, that's correct. Then discriminant is (101)^2 +4*1*102. 101 squared is 10201, plus 408 gives 10609. Square root of that is 103. \n\nSo 101+103 is 204, divided by 2 gives 102. \n\nSo all steps check out. Therefore the correct answer is E.\n\n\nThe problem involves finding the number of consecutive integers (k) starting from -50 that sum to 51. Using the arithmetic series sum formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n\\]\n\nThe first term is -50, and the last term is \\(-50 + (k - 1)\\). Substituting the given sum of 51:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\times [-50 + (-50 + (k - 1))]\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the terms inside the brackets:\n\n\\[\n-50 + (-50 + k - 1) = k - 101\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back:\n\n\\[\n51 = \\frac{k}{2} \\times (k - 101)\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\n102 = k(k - 101)\n\\]\n\nRearranging into a quadratic equation:\n\n\\[\nk^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n\\]\n\nSolving using the quadratic formula \\(k = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\):\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 \\pm \\sqrt{101^2 + 4 \\times 102}}{2} = \\frac{101 \\pm 103}{2}\n\\]\n\nThe positive solution is:\n\n\\[\nk = \\frac{101 + 103}{2} = 102\n\\]\n\nVerification shows that the sequence from -50 to 51 (inclusive) indeed sums to 51 with 102 terms. Thus, the correct answer is E.\n\nAnswer: E",
