      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Meenu's weight. Hmm, Silu says she weighs 51 kgs, but the question is about Meenu. Meenu doesn't want to tell directly, but gives a riddle: \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" Wait, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\n\nThe statement is: Meenu's weight equals 29 kg plus half of her own weight. Wait, that seems like an equation. Let me write that down. Let me call Meenu's weight M. So according to her, M = 29 + (1/2)*M. Oh right, because half of her weight is (1/2)M. \n\nSo solving for M, I can subtract (1/2)M from both sides. That gives M - (1/2)M = 29. That simplifies to (1/2)M = 29. Then multiplying both sides by 2, M = 58. Wait, but 58 is one of the options, option D. But wait, let me check again. Because sometimes these problems can be tricky. \n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood the wording. Let me read it again. \"I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.\" So the way it's phrased might be confusing. Let me think: if her total weight is 29 plus half of her weight, then the remaining half must be 29. Because if you take half of her weight and add 29, that gives the total. So the other half would be the 29. So that would mean her total weight is 58. So that makes sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is correct. Let me do the math again. If M = 29 + (M/2). Subtract M/2 from both sides: M/2 =29 \u2192 M =58. So yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D)58. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)12, B)28, C)27, D)58, E)91. So D is there. But maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, could there be another interpretation? Like maybe \"half of my weight\" refers to half of Silu's weight? But that doesn't make sense because the problem says Meenu is talking about her own weight. The problem states that Meenu's reply is about her own weight. So the equation should be correct. \n\nHmm, maybe I should test the answer. Let's plug in 58 into the original statement. If Meenu weighs 58, then half of her weight is 29. So 29 (the given number) plus 29 (half her weight) equals 58. Which matches. So that works. \n\nAlternatively, if someone thought that the equation was M = 29 + (half of Silu's weight), but Silu is 51. Then half of 51 is 25.5, so 29 +25.5=54.5, which isn't an option. So that's not the case. So the correct answer must be D, 58. \n\nLooking at the options again, D is 58, so that's the answer. The other options: like 27? Let's see. If someone tried plugging in 27, then half of 27 is 13.5. 29+13.5 is 42.5, which isn't 27. So that's wrong. 28: half is 14. 29+14=43, nope. 12: half is 6, 29+6=35, not 12. 91: half is 45.5. 29+45.5 is 74.5, so no. So yeah, only 58 works. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is D)58.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nMeenu's statement can be translated into an equation where her weight (M) is equal to 29 kg plus half of her own weight. Setting up the equation:\n\n\\[\nM = 29 + \\frac{1}{2}M\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(\\frac{1}{2}M\\) from both sides gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2}M = 29\n\\]\n\nMultiplying both sides by 2 yields:\n\n\\[\nM = 58\n\\]\n\nTesting this solution in the original statement confirms it works: 29 kg plus half of 58 kg (29 kg) equals 58 kg.
