      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about having a money pouch with Rs. 700, and the number of 25 paise, 50 paise, and one rupee coins are all equal. I need to find how many of each there are. The options are given, so maybe I can set up an equation and solve it.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the units. The total is in rupees, but the coins are in paise. So I should convert everything to the same unit. Since 1 rupee is 100 paise, maybe converting the total to paise would be easier. Rs. 700 is 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise.\n\nLet the number of each type of coin be 'n'. So there are n 25-paise coins, n 50-paise coins, and n 1-rupee coins. \n\nCalculating the total value from each type:\n- 25 paise coins contribute 25 * n paise.\n- 50 paise coins contribute 50 * n paise.\n- 1 rupee coins are 100 paise each, so 100 * n paise.\n\nAdding all these together should equal 70,000 paise. Let's write the equation:\n\n25n + 50n + 100n = 70,000\n\nAdding the left side: 25+50 is 75, plus 100 is 175. So 175n = 70,000.\n\nTo find n, divide both sides by 175:\n\nn = 70,000 / 175\n\nHmm, let me compute that. Let's see, 175 times 400 is 70,000 because 175*400 = 175*4*100 = 700*100=70,000. Oh wait, that's right! So n is 400. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 400. So the answer should be C. Let me check the options again to make sure I didn't misread. The options are A)453, B)651, C)400, D)487, E)286. Yep, C is there. \n\nWait a second, maybe I made a mistake in converting rupees to paise. Let me confirm. Rs. 700 is indeed 700 * 100 paise, so that's correct. The equation seems right. Each coin count is n, so adding their values gives the total. So 175n equals 70000, leading to n=400. That seems right. So the answer must be C.\n",
