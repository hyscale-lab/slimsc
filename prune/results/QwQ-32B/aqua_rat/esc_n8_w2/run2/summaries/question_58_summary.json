      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about percentages of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. Hmm. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa. So the total is 100%, right? The problem states that 10% are cocoa flavored. That means the remaining 90% must be vanilla. Got that part.\n\nNow, the next part says 90% of the rest are squashed. Wait, the wording here might be tricky. Let me read that again. \"90% of the rest are squashed.\" The \"rest\" probably refers to the remaining after the cocoa ones. Because the first part was about cocoa being 10%, so the rest would be the 90% vanilla. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the rest\" refers to the chocolates that are not cocoa? Because the first statement says 10% are cocoa, so the rest (which is 90%) are vanilla. Then, 90% of that 90% are squashed. Wait, but the question is about the vanilla ones that are NOT squashed. So let me parse the sentence again.\n\nThe problem says: \"10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, 90% of the rest are squashed.\" So \"the rest\" after the cocoa ones would be the 90% vanilla. So 90% of those 90% are squashed. Wait, so squashed applies to the rest (the vanilla ones). So 90% of the vanilla are squashed. Therefore, the non-squashed vanilla would be 10% of that 90%.\n\nLet me do the math. Let's assume there are 100 chocolates in total for simplicity.\n\nTotal chocolates: 100.\n\nCocoa: 10% \u2192 10 chocolates. So the rest (vanilla) is 90.\n\nNow, of that rest (the 90 vanilla), 90% are squashed. So squashed vanilla: 90% of 90 is 81. Therefore, the vanilla not squashed would be 90 - 81 = 9. So that's 9 out of the original 100, so 9%.\n\nWait, but the options have 9% as option D. Hmm. But let me check again because maybe I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait the question is asking for the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla and not squashed. According to my calculation, that's 9%, which is D. But let me see if there's another way to interpret the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the rest\" refers to all chocolates except the cocoa ones. Wait that's the same as before. Because the rest after cocoa is vanilla. So the interpretation seems correct.\n\nWait another way: perhaps \"90% of the rest are squashed\" refers to squashed among all the chocolates except cocoa? Or is the squashed only applied to the vanilla?\n\nHmm, the problem says \"90% of the rest are squashed.\" So \"the rest\" is the 90% (vanilla), so 90% of that 90% are squashed. So 0.9 * 90 = 81 squashed vanilla. The remaining 10% of the vanilla (90-81=9) are not squashed. So that's 9% of the total. So D is the answer. But let me check the options again. The options are A)1%, B)2%, C)5%, D)9%, E)10%.\n\nWait but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Let me go through the steps once more.\n\nTotal = 100 chocolates.\n\nCocoa: 10% \u2192 10. So vanilla is 90.\n\nNow, 90% of the rest (vanilla) are squashed. So 90% of 90 is 81. So squashed vanilla is 81. Not squashed vanilla is 90-81 =9. So 9% of total. So the answer is D. So the correct option is D?\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused because maybe the \"rest\" refers to all chocolates except cocoa, but squashed could be a separate category. Wait, the problem says \"90% of the rest are squashed.\" So the rest is the 90% (vanilla), so 90% of that 90% are squashed. So that part is correct.\n\nHmm, but maybe I'm missing something. Let me try an alternative approach. Suppose the total is 100.\n\nCocoa: 10. So 90 vanilla.\n\nTotal squashed: 90% of the rest (the 90) \u2192 81. So total squashed is 81 (all vanilla? Because cocoa's status isn't mentioned). Wait, but does the problem say that only the vanilla can be squashed? Or maybe the cocoa could be squashed as well?\n\nWait the problem says \"90% of the rest are squashed.\" The \"rest\" after cocoa, so the squashed applies to the vanilla. So cocoa's squashed status isn't considered here. So cocoa could be either squashed or not, but the problem doesn't mention that. Wait, but maybe the question is implying that only the vanilla ones are considered for the squashed part. Because the way the problem is phrased: first, 10% are cocoa. Then, of the remaining (non-cocoa), 90% are squashed. So the cocoa ones are not part of the squashed count here. So the squashed are 90% of the 90% vanilla, so 81. The non-squashed vanilla is 9% of total. So the answer is D, 9%.\n\nHmm, but the options include 9% as D, so that must be the correct answer. Wait but I feel like maybe I'm missing a step. Let me try again with different numbers.\n\nSuppose there are 1000 chocolates. Cocoa is 10% \u2192 100. Vanilla is 900. 90% of those 900 are squashed: 810. So 900 - 810 =90. So 90 out of 1000 is 9%.
