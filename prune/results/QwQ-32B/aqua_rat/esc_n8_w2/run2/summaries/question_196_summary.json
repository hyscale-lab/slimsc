      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about an electric pole and a tree's shadow. Let me see... The question is asking for the height of a tree that casts a 15-meter shadow, given that a 14-meter electric pole casts a 10-meter shadow. Hmm, right, this must be a similar triangles problem. Like, the sun's angle would create proportional shadows, right?\n\nAlright, so the idea is that the ratio of the height of the object to the length of its shadow should be the same for both the pole and the tree because the conditions are similar. So, setting up a proportion here. Let me write that down.\n\nLet me denote the height of the tree as h. Then the ratio for the pole is 14 meters height over 10 meters shadow. For the tree, it's h over 15 meters shadow. Since they are proportional, these two ratios should be equal. So the equation would be 14/10 = h/15. \n\nWait, right. So solving for h, I can cross-multiply. 14 times 15 equals 10 times h. Let me calculate that. 14 multiplied by 15... 14*10 is 140, and 14*5 is 70, so total 210. So 210 = 10h. Then dividing both sides by 10 gives h = 21. So the tree is 21 meters tall. Let me check the options. Option A is 21. So the answer should be A?\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up the ratios. Is it height over shadow or shadow over height? Let me think again. The ratio of height to shadow length for the pole is 14:10, and the tree's would be h:15. Since the conditions are the same, those ratios should be equal. So yes, 14/10 = h/15. So solving that gives h = (14*15)/10 = 210/10 =21. Yep, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as the shadow per meter of height. The pole's shadow is 10m for 14m height. So per meter of height, the shadow is 10/14 meters. Then the tree's shadow is 15m, so the height would be 15 divided by (10/14), which is 15*(14/10) = (15*14)/10. That's the same calculation as before, 210/10 =21. So that confirms it. \n\nHmm, the options include 21 as option A, so I think that's the right answer. I don't see any mistakes here. So the answer must be A)21.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about an electric pole and a tree's shadow. Let me see. The question is, an electric pole that's 14 meters high casts a shadow of 10 meters. They want to find the height of a tree that casts a 15-meter shadow under the same conditions. The options are from A to E. Hmm, right, this seems like a proportion problem. Like similar triangles maybe?\n\nAlright, so when objects cast shadows under the same conditions, the angle of the sun should be the same. That means the ratio of their heights to their shadow lengths should be equal. So the idea is that the height of the object divided by the length of its shadow is a constant. So, for the electric pole and the tree, their ratios should be the same.\n\nLet me write that down. Let's denote the height of the tree as h. Then the ratio for the pole is 14 meters height over 10 meters shadow. For the tree, it's h over 15 meters. Setting them equal: 14/10 = h/15. Then I can solve for h. \n\nCross-multiplying, 14 times 15 equals 10 times h. Let me calculate that. 14 multiplied by 15... 14*10 is 140, and 14*5 is 70, so 140+70 is 210. So 210 = 10h. Then divide both sides by 10: h = 210/10 = 21. So that would be 21 meters. Checking the options, A is 21. So the answer should be A?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Did I set up the proportion correctly? Because if the shadow is longer, the object's height would be proportional. Since the tree's shadow is longer (15 vs 10), the tree must be taller than 14. 15 is 1.5 times 10 (since 10*1.5=15). So the height should be 14 multiplied by 1.5. Let me do that. 14*1.5 is 21. Yep, same result. So that's correct. So the answer must be A)21. The options have that as the first choice. Okay, I think that's solid.\n",
