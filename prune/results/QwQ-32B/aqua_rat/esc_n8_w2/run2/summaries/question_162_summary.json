      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about mixing sand and clay. We have a 10kg mixture that's 30% sand and 70% clay. The goal is to make it have equal parts sand and clay. So, we need to figure out how much of the original mixture to remove and replace with pure sand to get that balance.\n\nHmm, right. So the current mixture has 30% sand, which is 3kg (since 10kg * 0.3 = 3kg) and 7kg clay. We need to get to 50% each, so 5kg sand and 5kg clay. \n\nThe tricky part is removing some of the mixture and replacing it with pure sand. Let me think of the steps here. Let's denote the amount to be removed and replaced as x kg. \n\nWhen you remove x kg of the original mixture, you're taking out both sand and clay in the same ratio they're present. Since the original mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, the amount of sand removed would be 0.3x and clay removed would be 0.7x. \n\nThen, after removing x kg, we replace that with x kg of pure sand. So the new amount of sand will be (original sand - removed sand) + added sand. The clay will just be original clay minus removed clay, since we're not adding any clay.\n\nLet me write equations for both components.\n\nLet's denote the amount to remove and replace as x. \n\nAfter removal:\nSand remaining = 3 - 0.3x\nClay remaining = 7 - 0.7x\n\nAfter adding x kg of pure sand:\nNew sand = (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x\nNew clay = 7 - 0.7x\n\nWe want these two quantities to be equal. So set them equal:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nHmm, solving for x. Let's see:\n\n0.7x + 0.7x = 7 -3  \n1.4x = 4  \nx = 4 / 1.4  \nHmm, 4 divided by 1.4. Let's compute that. \n\n1.4 is the same as 14/10, so 4 divided by (14/10) is 4*(10/14) = 40/14 = 20/7. \n\nWait, 20/7 is one of the options. Option B is 20/7. So that's the answer?\n\nWait a second, let me check again. Let me verify the steps once more to make sure.\n\nOriginal sand: 3kg, clay 7kg. \n\nRemove x kg of mixture. The sand removed is 0.3x, clay 0.7x. \n\nAfter removal, sand is 3-0.3x, clay 7-0.7x. \n\nAdd x kg of sand: so total sand becomes (3 -0.3x) +x = 3 +0.7x. \n\nClay remains at 7-0.7x. \n\nSet equal: 3 +0.7x = 7 -0.7x. \n\nAdding 0.7x to both sides: 3 +1.4x =7. \n\nSubtract 3: 1.4x =4 \u2192 x=4/1.4 \u2192 multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to get 40/14 \u2192 simplifies to 20/7. \n\nYes, that seems right. So the answer should be B)20/7. Let me check the options again. The options are A)10/7, B)20/7, C)30/7, D)40/7, E)50/7. Yep, B is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another approach. Suppose you remove x kg of the mixture and replace with x kg sand. The total mass remains 10kg. \n\nThe final concentration of sand should be 50%. \n\nThe formula for such replacement problems can sometimes be approached with the equation:\n\nFinal amount of a component = initial amount - (amount removed)*(concentration) + added amount. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: each time you remove x kg of the mixture, you're taking out a fraction of each component. Then adding pure sand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of conservation. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the formula for replacement:\n\nThe formula for concentration after replacement: \n\nThe remaining concentration of the original component (clay here) would be (1 - x/10) * original concentration. Because when you take out x kg, you're left with (10 -x) kg of original mixture, so the clay is (7/10)*(10 -x). Then since you add sand, the total clay remains (7*(10 -x)/10). \n\nWait, maybe that's another way to see it. The clay is only decreased by the amount removed. Since we are adding pure sand, which has no clay. \n\nSo the final amount of clay is 7*( (10 -x)/10 ), since the remaining mixture after removal is (10 -x) kg, which has the original clay proportion. \n\nWait, perhaps better:\n\nOriginal clay is 7kg. When you remove x kg of mixture (which has 70% clay), the remaining clay is 7 - 0.7x. \n\nWe want the final clay to be 5kg (since 50% of 10kg is 5kg). \n\nSo 7 -0.7x =5 \u2192 0.7x = 2 \u2192 x= 2 /0.7 = 20/7. \n\nSame answer. \n\nYes, that's a quicker way. So the answer is B. \n\nI think that's solid. So the correct option is B.\n",

I remember these types of mixture problems where you remove some of the mixture and replace it with another component.

Since the total mixture is 10kg, removing x kg of the original mixture and then adding x kg of pure sand. \n\nFirst, I need to track the amounts of sand and clay before and after. The original mixture has 30% sand, so that's 3kg sand and 7kg clay (since 10kg total). \n\nWhen we remove x kg of the original mixture, the amount of sand removed would be 30% of x, and the clay removed would be 70% of x.

So total sand is 3 -0.3x +x =3 +0.7x. \n\nSet that equal to 5 (since 50% of 10kg is 5). \n\n3 +0.7x =5 \u21920.7x =2 \u2192 x=2/0.7=20/7. Yep, same. \n\nSo all approaches lead to 20/7. So option B is the answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine how much of the 10kg mixture (containing 30% sand and 70% clay) should be removed and replaced with pure sand to achieve a 50-50 sand-clay mixture. Let \\( x \\) be the amount (in kg) to be removed and replaced with pure sand.\n\n1. **Initial Quantities**:\n   - Sand: \\( 30\\% \\times 10 = 3 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n   - Clay: \\( 70\\% \\times 10 = 7 \\, \\text{kg} \\)\n\n2. **After Removing \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of Mixture**:\n   - Sand removed: \\( 0.3x \\)\n   - Clay removed: \\( 0.7x \\)\n   - Remaining sand: \\( 3 - 0.3x \\)\n   - Remaining clay: \\( 7 - 0.7x \\)\n\n3. **After Adding \\( x \\, \\text{kg} \\) of Pure Sand**:\n   - New sand quantity: \\( (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x \\)\n   - Clay quantity remains: \\( 7 - 0.7x \\)\n\n4. **Set Sand Equal to Clay**:\n   \\[\n   3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x \\\\\n   1.4x = 4 \\\\\n   x = \\frac{4}{1.4} = \\frac{20}{7}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the amount to be removed and replaced is \\( \\frac{20}{7} \\, \\text{kg} \\), corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
