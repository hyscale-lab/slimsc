      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a flagstaff and a building's shadow. Let me see. The question is asking for the height of a building that casts a 28.75-meter shadow, given that a 17.5-meter flagstaff casts a 40.25-meter shadow. Hmm, I think this is a proportion problem. Like similar triangles or something because the conditions are the same, so the ratio of height to shadow length should be the same, right?\n\nAlright, let's think. The flagstaff's height is 17.5m and its shadow is 40.25m. The building's shadow is 28.75m, and we need to find its height. So the idea is that the ratio of height to shadow length is constant. So, setting up a proportion: 17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75. Then solve for x. \n\nWait, let me make sure. Because if the shadow is longer, the object is taller? Wait no, actually, if the shadow is longer, the object is taller? Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is height over shadow length. So if the shadow is longer, the height would be proportionally less. So for example, the flagstaff has a longer shadow than the building, so the building must be shorter than the flagstaff? Wait, the building's shadow is 28.75, which is shorter than 40.25. So the building is shorter? Wait, the flagstaff is 17.5m. Let me see. Let me just do the math.\n\nSo, setting up the proportion: (Height of flagstaff) / (Shadow of flagstaff) = (Height of building) / (Shadow of building). So 17.5 /40.25 = x /28.75. Cross-multiplying gives 17.5 *28.75 = 40.25 * x. Then x would be (17.5 *28.75)/40.25. \n\nHmm, let me calculate that. Let's see, first, maybe simplify the numbers. Let me see if 40.25 and 28.75 can be related. Maybe they have a common factor. Let me see: 40.25 divided by 28.75. Let's see, 28.75 is 28 and three-fourths, and 40.25 is 40 and a quarter. Maybe convert them to fractions over 4? Let me think:\n\n40.25 = 40 + 0.25 = 40 + 1/4 = (160/4 +1/4)=161/4? Wait 40*4 is 160, plus 1 is 161. So 40.25 is 161/4. Similarly 28.75 is 28 + 3/4, which is 28*4 is 112, plus 3 is 115, so 115/4. \n\nSo 17.5 is a decimal. 17.5 is 35/2. So substituting into the equation:\n\n(35/2) divided by (161/4) equals x divided by (115/4). \n\nWait, let me do the equation again. The proportion is (35/2) / (161/4) = x/(115/4). \n\nAlternatively, cross-multiplying:\n\n(35/2) * (115/4) = x * (161/4). \n\nHmm, let me compute left side: (35 * 115)/(2*4) = (35*115)/8. The right side is (161x)/4. \n\nMultiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n35*115 = 161x *2 \n\nWait, because right side would be (161x/4)*8 = 161x *2. Left side is 35*115. \n\nSo 35*115 = 2*161x. \n\nLet me compute 35*115. Hmm, 35*100 is 3500, 35*15 is 525, so total is 3500 +525=4025. \n\nThen 2*161 is 322. So 4025 = 322x. \n\nSo x = 4025 / 322. Let me compute that. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 7 perhaps? 322 divided by 7 is 46 (since 7*46 is 322). 4025 divided by 7: 7*575 is 4025 (since 7*500=3500, 7*75=525; 3500+525=4025). So 4025/7 is 575, 322/7 is 46. So now the fraction becomes 575/46. Let me compute that division. \n\n575 divided by 46. Let's see: 46*12 is 552. 575-552=23. So 12 and 23/46, which simplifies to 12.5. Because 23/46 is 0.5. So 12.5. So x is 12.5 meters. \n\nSo the answer should be option B)12.5 metre. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do it with decimals. Let me try again. 17.5 divided by 40.25 equals x over 28.75. \n\nSo 17.5/40.25 = x/28.75. Let me compute 17.5 divided by 40.25 first. \n\n17.5 \u00f7 40.25. Let me see. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 1750 /4025. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 25. 1750 \u00f725=70, 4025 \u00f725= 161. So that's 70/161. Hmm, 70 divided by 161. \n\nWait 70/161 is the same as 10/23 (since 70 divided by 7 is 10, 161 divided by 7 is 23). Because 7*23 is 161. So 70/161 =10/23. \n\nSo 10/23 = x/28.75. Then x = (10/23)*28.75. Let's compute that. 28.75 multiplied by 10 is 287.5. Divided by 23. \n\n287.5 \u00f723. Let's see: 23*12 =276. 287.5-276=11.5. 11.5 divided by 23 is 0.5. So total is 12.5. Yep, same result. \n\nSo the answer is B)12.5. That's one of the options. Let me check the options again. The options are A)12, B)12.5, C)13.5, D)14, E)15. So B is correct. \n\nI think that's solid. The key was setting up the proportion correctly. Height over shadow equals the same ratio. So yes, the building's height is 12.5 meters. So the answer should be B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem involves determining the height of a building using the ratio of height to shadow length, which should be consistent under similar conditions.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a flagstaff and a building's shadow. Let me see. The question is asking for the height of a building that casts a 28.75-meter shadow, given that a 17.5-meter flagstaff casts a 40.25-meter shadow. Hmm, I think this is a proportion problem. Like similar triangles or something because the conditions are the same, so the ratio of height to shadow length should be the same, right?\n\nAlright, let's think. The flagstaff's height is 17.5m and its shadow is 40.25m. The building's shadow is 28.75m, and we need to find its height. So the idea is that the ratio of height to shadow length is constant. So, setting up a proportion: 17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75. Then solve for x. \n\nWait, let me make sure. Because if the shadow is longer, the object is taller? Wait no, actually, if the shadow is longer, the object is taller? Wait, no. Wait, the ratio is height over shadow length. So if the shadow is longer, the height would be proportionally less. So for example, the flagstaff has a longer shadow than the building, so the building must be shorter than the flagstaff? Wait, the building's shadow is 28.75, which is shorter than 40.25. So the building is shorter? Wait, the flagstaff is 17.5m. Let me see. Let me just do the math.\n\nSo, setting up the proportion: (Height of flagstaff) / (Shadow of flagstaff) = (Height of building) / (Shadow of building). So 17.5 /40.25 = x /28.75. Cross-multiplying gives 17.5 *28.75 = 40.25 * x. Then x would be (17.5 *28.75)/40.25. \n\nHmm, let me calculate that. Let's see, first, maybe simplify the numbers. Let me see if 40.25 and 28.75 can be related. Maybe they have a common factor. Let me see: 40.25 divided by 28.75. Let's see, 28.75 is 28 and three-fourths, and 40.25 is 40 and a quarter. Maybe convert them to fractions over 4? Let me think:\n\n40.25 = 40 + 0.25 = 40 + 1/4 = (160/4 +1/4)=161/4? Wait 40*4 is 160, plus 1 is 161. So 40.25 is 161/4. Similarly 28.75 is 28 + 3/4, which is 28*4 is 112, plus 3 is 115, so 115/4. \n\nSo 17.5 is a decimal. 17.5 is 35/2. So substituting into the equation:\n\n(35/2) divided by (161/4) equals x divided by (115/4). \n\nWait, let me do the equation again. The proportion is (35/2) / (161/4) = x/(115/4). \n\nAlternatively, cross-multiplying:\n\n(35/2) * (115/4) = x * (161/4). \n\nHmm, let me compute left side: (35 * 115)/(2*4) = (35*115)/8. The right side is (161x)/4. \n\nMultiply both sides by 8 to eliminate denominators:\n\n35*115 = 161x *2 \n\nWait, because right side would be (161x/4)*8 = 161x *2. Left side is 35*115. \n\nSo 35*115 = 2*161x. \n\nLet me compute 35*115. Hmm, 35*100 is 3500, 35*15 is 525, so total is 3500 +525=4025. \n\nThen 2*161 is 322. So 4025 = 322x. \n\nSo x = 4025 / 322. Let me compute that. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 7 perhaps? 322 divided by 7 is 46 (since 7*46 is 322). 4025 divided by 7: 7*575 is 4025 (since 7*500=3500, 7*75=525; 3500+525=4025). So 4025/7 is 575, 322/7 is 46. So now the fraction becomes 575/46. Let me compute that division. \n\n575 divided by 46. Let's see: 46*12 is 552. 575-552=23. So 12 and 23/46, which simplifies to 12.5. Because 23/46 is 0.5. So 12.5. So x is 12.5 meters. \n\nSo the answer should be option B)12.5 metre. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can do it with decimals. Let me try again. 17.5 divided by 40.25 equals x over 28.75. \n\nSo 17.5/40.25 = x/28.75. Let me compute 17.5 divided by 40.25 first. \n\n17.5 \u00f7 40.25. Let me see. Let's multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 1750 /4025. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 25. 1750 \u00f725=70, 4025 \u00f725= 161. So that's 70/161. Hmm, 70 divided by 161. \n\nWait 70/161 is the same as 10/23 (since 70 divided by 7 is 10, 161 divided by 7 is 23). Because 7*23 is 161. So 70/161 =10/23. \n\nSo 10/23 = x/28.75. Then x = (10/23)*28.75. Let's compute that. 28.75 multiplied by 10 is 287.5. Divided by 23. \n\n287.5 \u00f723. Let's see: 23*12 =276. 287.5-276=11.5. 11.5 divided by 23 is 0.5. So total is 12.5. Yep, same result. \n\nSo the answer is B)12.5. That's one of the options. Let me check the options again. The options are A)12, B)12.5, C)13.5, D)14, E)15. So B is correct. \n\nI think that's solid. The key was setting up the proportion correctly. Height over shadow equals the same ratio. So yes, the building's height is 12.5 meters. So the answer should be B.\n\n\nThe problem involves determining the height of a building using the ratio of height to shadow length, which should be consistent under similar conditions. The flagstaff's height (17.5 m) and shadow (40.25 m) establish this ratio.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a flagstaff and a building's shadow. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is saying that a flagstaff that's 17.5 meters high casts a shadow of 40.25 meters. Then they want to know the height of a building that casts a shadow of 28.75 meters under the same conditions. Alright, this sounds like a proportion problem, right? Like similar triangles or something because the conditions are the same, so the ratio of height to shadow length should be the same for both the flagstaff and the building.\n\nLet me think. The idea is that the height and shadow length are directly proportional. So if I set up a ratio of height to shadow for the flagstaff, that should equal the ratio for the building. So the equation would be 17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75, where x is the height of the building. Then I can solve for x.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got the ratios right. The height divided by shadow length for both should be equal. Yeah, because if the sun's angle is the same, then the ratio of actual height to shadow length should be the same for any object. So that part is correct.\n\nSo let's compute that. Let me write it down again:\n\n17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75\n\nI need to solve for x. To do this, I can cross-multiply. So 17.5 * 28.75 = x * 40.25. Then x would be (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25.\n\nHmm, calculating that. Let me see. Maybe I can simplify the numbers first. Let me see if the numbers can be divided by some common factors. Let's see, 40.25 and 28.75. Both end with .25, so maybe multiplying numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals. Wait, but maybe fractions would be easier. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 17.5 multiplied by 28.75 first. Let me do that step by step. 17.5 times 28.75. Hmm. Let's break this down. 17.5 * 28 is 17.5 * 28. Let's compute that first. 17 * 28 is 476, and 0.5 *28 is 14, so total is 476 +14 = 490. Then, 17.5 * 0.75 (since 28.75 is 28 +0.75). Wait, maybe another way: 28.75 is the same as 28 and three quarters, which is 28 + 0.75. Alternatively, maybe 28.75 = 115/4? Let me check:\n\nWait, 28.75 *4 = 115, yes. So 28.75 is 115/4. And 17.5 is 35/2. So 35/2 multiplied by 115/4 equals (35*115)/(2*4). Let me compute that numerator. 35*115. Let me compute 35*100 = 3500, 35*15=525, so total 3500+525 = 4025. So 4025/(8). So the numerator of the cross product is 4025. Then the denominator is 40.25, which is 40.25. Wait, but the equation is (17.5 *28.75) divided by 40.25 equals x.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's a way to simplify fractions before multiplying. Let me see the original equation again:\n\nx = (17.5 *28.75)/40.25\n\nHmm, maybe I can convert all numbers to fractions. Let me try that again. 17.5 is 35/2, 28.75 is 115/4, and 40.25 is 161/4 (since 40.25*4=161). Wait, let me check: 40.25 multiplied by 4 is 161? Let's see, 40*4=160, 0.25*4=1, so yes 161. So 40.25 is 161/4.\n\nSo substituting all into fractions:\n\nx = ( (35/2) * (115/4) ) / (161/4 )\n\nDividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal. So:\n\n= (35/2 * 115/4 ) * (4/161)\n\nThe 4 in the denominator and the 4 in the numerator can cancel out. So that leaves:\n\n35/2 * 115 / 161\n\nHmm, let's see if 115 and 161 have a common factor. 115 is 5*23, and 161 is 7*23. Oh, both have a 23. So 115/161 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 23.\n\n115 \u00f723 =5, 161 \u00f723=7. So that becomes 5/7.\n\nSo now, the equation is 35/2 * (5/7). Let's compute that. 35 divided by 7 is 5, so 5*5=25, divided by 2? Wait:\n\nWait, 35/2 multiplied by 5/7 is (35 *5)/(2*7). The 35 and 7 can be simplified. 35 is 5*7, so 35/7 =5. So that leaves (5 *5)/2 =25/2 =12.5.\n\nOh! So x is 12.5 meters. That's option B. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me verify using decimals again. Let's compute 17.5 *28.75 first. 17.5 multiplied by 28.75.\n\nAnother way: 17.5 *28.75 = 17.5*(28 +0.75) =17.5*28 +17.5*0.75.\n\n17.5 *28: 17*28=476, 0.5*28=14 \u2192 476+14=490.\n\n17.5 *0.75: 17.5*(3/4) = (17.5*3)/4 =52.5/4=13.125.\n\nSo total is 490 +13.125= 503.125.\n\nThen divide that by 40.25: 503.125 /40.25.\n\nHmm, let's compute that division. Let me write this as 503.125 \u00f740.25. Let me see. Let me convert both numbers to fractions over 1000 or something? Or maybe multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals. Let's try that.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 100: 503.125 *100 =50312.5, and 40.25 *100=4025. So now it's 50312.5 /4025.\n\nHmm, but 50312.5 divided by 4025. Let me see if I can divide numerator and denominator by 25. Let's see:\n\n4025 \u00f725 is 161, 50312.5 \u00f725 is 50312.5 /25 = 2012.5. Wait, 25 times 2000 is 50,000. So 2012.5 \u00d725 = 50,312.5, yes.\n\nSo now it's 2012.5 /161. Let me compute that. 161 \u00d712 = 1932. 2012.5 -1932=80.5. So 12 + (80.5/161). 80.5 divided by 161 is 0.5. So total is 12.5. Oh, that's the same as before. So that gives 12.5, which is B. Okay, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)12\n\nB)12.5\n\nC)13.5\n\nD)14\n\nE)15\n\nYes, so B is 12.5. So that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think in terms of proportion. The shadow of the building is shorter than the flagstaff's shadow. Since 28.75 is less than 40.25, the building must be shorter than 17.5 meters? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the flagstaff is 17.5m with a longer shadow. Wait, the building's shadow is shorter, so the building would be shorter than the flagstaff? Wait, no, wait, the flagstaff is 17.5m tall, and its shadow is 40.25. The building's shadow is 28.75, which is shorter. So under the same conditions, if the shadow is shorter, the object must be shorter? Wait, that makes sense. Because if the sun is lower, longer shadows, but here the conditions are the same, so a shorter shadow would mean the object is shorter. Wait, but 17.5 is the height of the flagstaff, so the building would be shorter than that? But the answer came out as 12.5, which is indeed less than 17.5. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the ratio. The ratio of shadow lengths is 28.75 /40.25. Let me compute that. 28.75 divided by 40.25. Let's see, 28.75 /40.25 = (28.75 \u00f7 28.75)/(40.25 \u00f728.75) \u2192 but that's 1/(40.25/28.75). Alternatively, 28.75 /40.25 = (28.75 \u00f7 1.25) / (40.25 \u00f71.25) = 23/32.2? Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the ratio as a decimal. 28.75 divided by 40.25. Let me compute 28.75 \u00f740.25. Let's see, 40.25 \u00d70.7 = 28.175. That's close to 28.75. 0.7 gives 28.175, subtract that from 28.75: 28.75-28.175 =0.575. So 0.575 /40.25 \u2248 0.0143. So total ratio is approximately 0.7 +0.0143 \u22480.7143. Wait, 0.7143 is roughly 5/7 (since 5/7\u22480.714). Oh, that's interesting. So the shadow ratio is approximately 5/7. So then the height of the building would be 17.5 multiplied by (28.75/40.25) which is 17.5*(5/7) = (17.5/7)*5 =2.5*5=12.5. Exactly. So that's another way to see it. So that confirms the same answer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be B)12.5 meters.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the concept of proportionality since the conditions are the same for both the flagstaff and the building.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about a flagstaff and a building's shadow. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is saying that a flagstaff that's 17.5 meters high casts a shadow of 40.25 meters. Then they want to know the height of a building that casts a shadow of 28.75 meters under the same conditions. Alright, this sounds like a proportion problem, right? Like similar triangles or something because the conditions are the same, so the ratio of height to shadow length should be the same for both the flagstaff and the building.\n\nLet me think. The idea is that the height and shadow length are directly proportional. So if I set up a ratio of height to shadow for the flagstaff, that should equal the ratio for the building. So the equation would be 17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75, where x is the height of the building. Then I can solve for x.\n\nWait, let me make sure I got the ratios right. The height divided by shadow length for both should be equal. Yeah, because if the sun's angle is the same, then the ratio of actual height to shadow length should be the same for any object. So that part is correct.\n\nSo let's compute that. Let me write it down again:\n\n17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75\n\nI need to solve for x. To do this, I can cross-multiply. So 17.5 * 28.75 = x * 40.25. Then x would be (17.5 * 28.75) / 40.25.\n\nHmm, calculating that. Let me see. Maybe I can simplify the numbers first. Let me see if the numbers can be divided by some common factors. Let's see, 40.25 and 28.75. Both end with .25, so maybe multiplying numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals. Wait, but maybe fractions would be easier. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 17.5 multiplied by 28.75 first. Let me do that step by step. 17.5 times 28.75. Hmm. Let's break this down. 17.5 * 28 is 17.5 * 28. Let's compute that first. 17 * 28 is 476, and 0.5 *28 is 14, so total is 476 +14 = 490. Then, 17.5 * 0.75 (since 28.75 is 28 +0.75). Wait, maybe another way: 28.75 is the same as 28 and three quarters, which is 28 + 0.75. Alternatively, maybe 28.75 = 115/4? Let me check:\n\nWait, 28.75 *4 = 115, yes. So 28.75 is 115/4. And 17.5 is 35/2. So 35/2 multiplied by 115/4 equals (35*115)/(2*4). Let me compute that numerator. 35*115. Let me compute 35*100 = 3500, 35*15=525, so total 3500+525 = 4025. So 4025/(8). So the numerator of the cross product is 4025. Then the denominator is 40.25, which is 40.25. Wait, but the equation is (17.5 *28.75) divided by 40.25 equals x.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's a way to simplify fractions before multiplying. Let me see the original equation again:\n\nx = (17.5 *28.75)/40.25\n\nHmm, maybe I can convert all numbers to fractions. Let me try that again. 17.5 is 35/2, 28.75 is 115/4, and 40.25 is 161/4 (since 40.25*4=161). Wait, let me check: 40.25 multiplied by 4 is 161? Let's see, 40*4=160, 0.25*4=1, so yes 161. So 40.25 is 161/4.\n\nSo substituting all into fractions:\n\nx = ( (35/2) * (115/4) ) / (161/4 )\n\nDividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal. So:\n\n= (35/2 * 115/4 ) * (4/161)\n\nThe 4 in the denominator and the 4 in the numerator can cancel out. So that leaves:\n\n35/2 * 115 / 161\n\nHmm, let's see if 115 and 161 have a common factor. 115 is 5*23, and 161 is 7*23. Oh, both have a 23. So 115/161 can be simplified by dividing numerator and denominator by 23.\n\n115 \u00f723 =5, 161 \u00f723=7. So that becomes 5/7.\n\nSo now, the equation is 35/2 * (5/7). Let's compute that. 35 divided by 7 is 5, so 5*5=25, divided by 2? Wait:\n\nWait, 35/2 multiplied by 5/7 is (35 *5)/(2*7). The 35 and 7 can be simplified. 35 is 5*7, so 35/7 =5. So that leaves (5 *5)/2 =25/2 =12.5.\n\nOh! So x is 12.5 meters. That's option B. Let me check if that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me verify using decimals again. Let's compute 17.5 *28.75 first. 17.5 multiplied by 28.75.\n\nAnother way: 17.5 *28.75 = 17.5*(28 +0.75) =17.5*28 +17.5*0.75.\n\n17.5 *28: 17*28=476, 0.5*28=14 \u2192 476+14=490.\n\n17.5 *0.75: 17.5*(3/4) = (17.5*3)/4 =52.5/4=13.125.\n\nSo total is 490 +13.125= 503.125.\n\nThen divide that by 40.25: 503.125 /40.25.\n\nHmm, let's compute that division. Let me write this as 503.125 \u00f740.25. Let me see. Let me convert both numbers to fractions over 1000 or something? Or maybe multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals. Let's try that.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 100: 503.125 *100 =50312.5, and 40.25 *100=4025. So now it's 50312.5 /4025.\n\nHmm, but 50312.5 divided by 4025. Let me see if I can divide numerator and denominator by 25. Let's see:\n\n4025 \u00f725 is 161, 50312.5 \u00f725 is 50312.5 /25 = 2012.5. Wait, 25 times 2000 is 50,000. So 2012.5 \u00d725 = 50,312.5, yes.\n\nSo now it's 2012.5 /161. Let me compute that. 161 \u00d712 = 1932. 2012.5 -1932=80.5. So 12 + (80.5/161). 80.5 divided by 161 is 0.5. So total is 12.5. Oh, that's the same as before. So that gives 12.5, which is B. Okay, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)12\n\nB)12.5\n\nC)13.5\n\nD)14\n\nE)15\n\nYes, so B is 12.5. So that's the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Let's think in terms of proportion. The shadow of the building is shorter than the flagstaff's shadow. Since 28.75 is less than 40.25, the building must be shorter than 17.5 meters? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the flagstaff is 17.5m with a longer shadow. Wait, the building's shadow is shorter, so the building would be shorter than the flagstaff? Wait, no, wait, the flagstaff is 17.5m tall, and its shadow is 40.25. The building's shadow is 28.75, which is shorter. So under the same conditions, if the shadow is shorter, the object must be shorter? Wait, that makes sense. Because if the sun is lower, longer shadows, but here the conditions are the same, so a shorter shadow would mean the object is shorter. Wait, but 17.5 is the height of the flagstaff, so the building would be shorter than that? But the answer came out as 12.5, which is indeed less than 17.5. So that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the ratio. The ratio of shadow lengths is 28.75 /40.25. Let me compute that. 28.75 divided by 40.25. Let's see, 28.75 /40.25 = (28.75 \u00f7 28.75)/(40.25 \u00f728.75) \u2192 but that's 1/(40.25/28.75). Alternatively, 28.75 /40.25 = (28.75 \u00f7 1.25) / (40.25 \u00f71.25) = 23/32.2? Hmm, maybe not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the ratio as a decimal. 28.75 divided by 40.25. Let me compute 28.75 \u00f740.25. Let's see, 40.25 \u00d70.7 = 28.175. That's close to 28.75. 0.7 gives 28.175, subtract that from 28.75: 28.75-28.175 =0.575. So 0.575 /40.25 \u2248 0.0143. So total ratio is approximately 0.7 +0.0143 \u22480.7143. Wait, 0.7143 is roughly 5/7 (since 5/7\u22480.714). Oh, that's interesting. So the shadow ratio is approximately 5/7. So then the height of the building would be 17.5 multiplied by (28.75/40.25) which is 17.5*(5/7) = (17.5/7)*5 =2.5*5=12.5. Exactly. So that's another way to see it. So that confirms the same answer. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be B)12.5 meters.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we use the concept of proportionality since the conditions are the same for both the flagstaff and the building. The ratio of height to shadow length must be equal for both objects. \n\nThe equation is set up as:\n\\[\n\\frac{17.5}{40.25} = \\frac{x}{28.75}\n\\]\nwhere \\( x \\) is the height of the building.
