      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the total discount when there's a manufacturer's 20% discount followed by an additional 20% from the retailer. Hmm, let's see. I remember that discounts stack multiplicatively, not additively. Like, if you have two discounts, you can't just add them together. Wait, right, because the second discount is applied after the first one. So let's think step by step.\n\nLet me assume the original price of the tyre is, say, $100. That might make it easier. Okay, first the manufacturer gives 20% off. So 20% of 100 is 20, so the price after the first discount is $80. Then the retailer offers an additional 20% discount. Wait, but is that 20% off the original price or the already discounted price? I think it's off the already discounted price because the problem states it's an additional discount. So the second 20% is on the $80. \n\nCalculating 20% of 80, that's 16. So subtracting that from 80 gives 64. So the final price is $64. The total discount from the original $100 would be $36. So the total discount percentage is 36% off the original price. Wait, but looking at the options, E is 36%. But wait, maybe I did that right. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think 20% + 20% is 40%, but that's wrong because the second discount is applied after the first. So the total discount isn't additive. So 100*(1 - 0.2)*(1 - 0.2) = 100*0.8*0.8 = 64, so 36% total discount. So the answer should be E)36%.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)10%, B)25%, C)28%, D)30%, E)36%. So E matches. But wait, maybe I'm missing something here. Let me think again. Another way to compute total discount: the formula is total discount = a + b - (a*b)/100 where a and b are the two discounts. Wait, is that the formula? Let me recall. \n\nWait, actually, that formula gives the combined discount when two successive discounts are applied. Let me see. Let's say the first discount is 20% and the second is 20%. So a =20, b=20. Then the total discount would be 20 +20 - (20*20)/100 =40 -4=36%. Oh right, so that gives 36% as well. So that confirms it. So the correct answer is E. \n\nAlternatively, some might think that the total discount is 20+20=40, but that's not correct. So the answer is E. I think that's right. Let me see another example. Suppose original price is $200. First discount 20%: 200 -40=160. Then 20% off on 160: 32 discount. Total paid 128. Total discount from 200 is 72. 72/200 is 0.36, so 36%. Yep. So E is correct.\n",
