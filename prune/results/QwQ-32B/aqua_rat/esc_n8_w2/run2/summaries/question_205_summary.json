      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through a drain, given the rate is w/25 gallons every x seconds. Hmm, right. I need to find the time in minutes.\n\nFirst, let me parse the given rate. The rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. So maybe I should write that as a rate in gallons per second first. Wait, the rate would be (w/25) divided by x, because it's gallons divided by time. So the rate R is (w/25)/x gallons per second. Let me write that as R = w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nNow, the question is, how long does it take to drain y gallons? Time is equal to amount divided by rate, right? So time t = y / R. Substituting R, that would be y divided by (w/(25x)). Which is y * (25x)/w. So that gives t = (25x y)/w seconds. But the question asks for minutes, so I need to convert seconds to minutes. Since 1 minute is 60 seconds, I divide the seconds by 60. So the time in minutes would be (25xy/w) divided by 60. Let me compute that: (25xy)/(60w). Hmm, simplifying that fraction. 25 and 60 can both be divided by 5. 25 \u00f75 is 5, 60 \u00f75 is 12. So that becomes (5xy)/(12w). Oh wait, that's option C?\n\nLooking at the options again. Let me check again. The options are:\n\nA)y/(1200xy) \u2192 no, that has y in denominator which doesn't make sense.\n\nB)20xy/w \u2192 that's way bigger. Let me see, 25 divided by 60 is 5/12, so 5/(12) times (xy)/w. So yeah, 5/(12) is the coefficient. So the answer should be 5xy/(12w), which is option C. Let me check the options again. Option C is 5xy/(12w). So that's correct. \n\nWait, let me retrace steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The rate is w/25 gallons every x seconds. So gallons per second is (w/25) / x, which is w/(25x). Then time in seconds to move y gallons is y divided by that rate, so y/(w/(25x)) = 25xy/w seconds. Convert to minutes: divide by 60. So (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w). Yep, that's exactly option C. So the answer must be C.\n",

So maybe the rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. To find the time for y gallons, I need to convert that rate into gallons per second first, maybe?\n\nLet me think.
