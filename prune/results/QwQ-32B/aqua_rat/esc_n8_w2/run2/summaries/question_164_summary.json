      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the greatest number of identical bouquets that can be made using 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips, with none left over. And the bouquets are identical if they have the same number of each color. Hmm, right.\n\nSo, I need to figure out how to divide both the white and red tulips into equal parts such that the number of parts is the same for both colors. Because each bouquet has to have the same number of white and red tulips. So, like, if I split the white into groups and the red into the same number of groups, then each bouquet would be one group of each. \n\nWait, so the key here is that the number of bouquets has to be a common divisor of both 28 and 98. Because you can't split 28 into, say, 5 equal parts without having leftovers. So the maximum number would be the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 28 and 98. Oh right, that makes sense. Because GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers exactly.\n\nSo I need to compute GCD(28, 98). Let me think how to do that. The prime factors maybe?\n\nBreaking down 28: 2 \u00d7 14, then 14 is 2\u00d77. So 28 is 2\u00b2 \u00d77.\n\nNow 98: 2 \u00d749, and 49 is 7\u00b2. So 98 is 2 \u00d77\u00b2.\n\nThe GCD is the product of the lowest powers of the common primes. So for 2, the lowest exponent is 1 (since 28 has 2\u00b2 and 98 has 2\u00b9). For 7, the lowest exponent is 1 (since 28 has 7\u00b9 and 98 has 7\u00b2). So GCD is 2^1 \u00d77^1 = 14. Wait, so the GCD is 14?\n\nWait, let me check again. Let me list the divisors of both numbers to confirm.\n\nDivisors of 28: 1,2,4,7,14,28.\n\nDivisors of 98: 1,2,7,14,49,98.\n\nThe common divisors are 1,2,7,14. The greatest is 14. So yes, the GCD is 14. So the answer should be D)14. \n\nWait the options are A)4, B)7, C)10, D)14, E)21. So D is an option. That's the highest possible. Let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the GCD calculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the Euclidean algorithm. Let's try that. GCD(98,28). \n\nDivide 98 by 28. 28*3=84, remainder 14. Then GCD(28,14). 28 divided by 14 is 2 with remainder 0. So the GCD is 14. Yep, that's correct. So the answer must be D.\n",

Let me check.\n\nFirst, let me recall how to compute GCD. One way is to break both numbers into their prime factors. \n\nStarting with 28: 28 divided by 2 is 14, divided by 2 again is 7. So 28 is 2^2 * 7^1. \n\nThen 98: 98 divided by 2 is 49, which is 7 squared. So 98 is 2 * 7^2. \n\nNow, the GCD is the product of the smallest powers of the common primes.

So GCD is 14. \n\nYep, that's the same as before. So the answer is definitely D. \n\nWait, but why is option B 7? Oh because maybe someone might think of 28 divided by 4 is 7, but no.
