      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this simple interest problem. Let me think. The question is about Rahul borrowing Rs. 500 at 6% per annum simple interest, and we need to find out how much he has to pay after 4 years. The options are given, but I should work it out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T / 100. Right? Where P is the principal amount, R is the rate, and T is time in years. Then, the total amount to pay back would be the principal plus the interest. So the total amount A = P + I, which can also be written as A = P(1 + RT/100). \n\nLet me plug in the numbers here. The principal (P) is 500 rupees. The rate (R) is 6% per annum. Time (T) is 4 years. \n\nCalculating the interest first: I = 500 * 6 * 4 / 100. Let me compute that. \n\nMultiplying 500 by 6 gives 3000. Then multiply by 4, that's 12,000. Then divide by 100, so 12,000 /100 is 120. So the interest is Rs. 120. \n\nTherefore, the total amount after 4 years would be the principal plus interest: 500 + 120 = 620. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 620. So the answer should be C. Wait, but let me double-check in case I made a calculation error. \n\nAlternatively, let me recalculate the interest again. 6% of 500 is 30 per year (since 500*0.06 = 30). Over four years, that's 30 *4 = 120. Yep, same result. So total is 620. \n\nThe options given include C)620. So the correct answer must be C. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)750, B)700, C)620, D)600, E)None. So C is there, so the answer is C. Therefore, the correct choice is option C.\n",
