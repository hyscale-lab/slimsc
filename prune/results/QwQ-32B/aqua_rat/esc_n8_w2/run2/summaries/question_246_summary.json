      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this probability problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the probability that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election. The given probability that a voter voted is 90%, right?\n\nHmm, right. So this sounds like a binomial probability problem. Because each voter is an independent trial with two outcomes: voted or didn't vote. The question is asking for exactly four successes (voted) out of five trials. \n\nLet me recall the formula for binomial probability. The formula is P(k) = C(n, k) * p^k * (1-p)^(n-k). Where n is the number of trials, k the number of successes, p the probability of success. \n\nSo here, n is 5, k is 4, p is 0.9. Let me plug those numbers in. \n\nFirst, calculate the combination C(5,4). That's 5 choose 4. Since combinations are n!/(k!(n-k)! ), so 5!/(4!1!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/( (4*3*2*1)*(1) ) = 5/1 =5. So that part is 5. \n\nThen, p^k is (0.9)^4. Let me compute that. 0.9^4. Let's see, 0.9 squared is 0.81, then squared again would be 0.81 * 0.81. Wait, no. Wait, 0.9^4 is (0.9)^2 * (0.9)^2. 0.81 * 0.81 is 0.6561. Wait, no, that's (0.9)^4? Wait, 0.9 *0.9 is 0.81, then times 0.9 again is 0.729, and again 0.6561. Oh right, so (0.9)^4 = 0.6561. \n\nThen (1-p) is 0.1, and that's raised to the (5-4)=1 power. So 0.1^1 is 0.1. \n\nPutting it all together: 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1. Let me multiply those. \n\nFirst 5 * 0.6561 is 3.2805. Then multiply by 0.1 gives 0.32805. So that's 32.805%. \n\nLooking at the options, option B is 32.8%, which would be the closest. \n\nWait, but let me check if I did all steps correctly. Let me verify the combination again. 5 choose 4 is indeed 5. The exponents: yes, since we have four successes (0.9) and one failure (0.1). So the calculation seems right. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be B)32.8%. Let me check if any of the other options are close. The next option is A)26.2 which is lower, and C is higher. So 32.8 is exactly what I got. So I think that's correct.\n",

The problem is about finding the likelihood that exactly four out of five randomly chosen registered voters in Burghtown voted in the last election.

That seems right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I confused the combination? Let me confirm C(5,4). Since combinations are n!/(k!(n-k)!), so 5!/(4!1!) = (5*4*3*2*1)/( (4*3*2*1)*(1) ) ) = 5.
