      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about figuring out the minimum number of DVDs I need to rent each month to make the membership worth it. Hmm. So, without the membership, each DVD is $4. But with the membership, which costs $7 a month, each rental is $2. I need to find the point where the total cost with the membership is less than without it. \n\nLet me think. Let's say I rent 'x' number of DVDs. Without the membership, the total cost is 4 times x, right? Like 4x. With the membership, it's the $7 fee plus 2x for the rentals. So the equation would be when 7 + 2x is less than 4x. Because that's when the membership becomes cheaper.\n\nWait, so setting them equal first to find the break-even point. Let me do that. So 7 + 2x =4x. Subtract 2x from both sides: 7=2x. Then x would be 3.5. Oh, but you can't rent half a DVD. So since it's asking for the minimum where it's worth it, you have to round up. So 4 DVDs? Let me check that again.\n\nIf I rent 3 DVDs: without membership is 3*4=12. With membership, 7 + 3*2= 7+6=13. So 13 vs 12. That's more expensive. So 3 isn't enough. Then at 4: 4*4=16. With membership: 7 +8=15. 15 is less than 16, so that's better. So the minimum is 4. So the answer would be D)4. Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)1, B)2, C)3, D)4, E)5. So D is 4. That seems right. Let me confirm with 4 again. 4 movies: membership total is 7 + (2*4) =15. Without, it's 16. So saving a dollar. So yeah, 4 is the minimum. So the answer is D.\n",
