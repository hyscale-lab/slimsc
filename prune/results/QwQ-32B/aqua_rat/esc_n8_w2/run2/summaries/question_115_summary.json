      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the range of x given that n is between 36 and 72 inclusive. The expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). I need to simplify this expression first, maybe factor it somehow. Let me see.\n\nWait, the numerator is n squared plus 2 times sqrt(n) times (n+4) plus 16? Wait, maybe I should parse that again. Let me make sure I got the expression right. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4. \n\nHmm. Let me see if I can factor numerator and denominator as some squares. Because the structure looks similar to a quadratic in terms of sqrt(n). Let me think of substituting variables here. Let\u2019s let\u2019s set a = sqrt(n). Since n is between 36 and 72, a would be between 6 and sqrt(72). Wait sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) which is approximately 8.485. So a is between 6 and about 8.485. \n\nSo substituting a = sqrt(n), then n = a\u00b2. Let me rewrite the numerator and denominator in terms of a.\n\nNumerator: (a\u00b2)^2 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16. Wait, let me compute that step by step. Wait, the original numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an*(n +4) +16. Substituting n =a\u00b2, that becomes (a\u00b2)^2 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16. Let's expand that:\n\nFirst term: a^4.\n\nSecond term: 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) = 2a^3 +8a.\n\nThird term: +16.\n\nSo numerator is a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16? Wait, hold on. Wait, adding all together: a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16? Hmm, that's the numerator. \n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4 = a\u00b2 +4a +4. Which looks like (a +2)^2. Oh, that's a perfect square. Because (a +2)^2 = a\u00b2 +4a +4. So denominator simplifies to (a +2)^2. \n\nNow the numerator: let's see if that can be factored. Hmm, a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. Wait, maybe grouping terms?\n\nLet me see: Let me try to see if the numerator can be written as (a^2 + something)^2 or something similar. Let me check.\n\nWait, let's think again. Maybe I made a mistake in expanding the numerator. Let me re-calculate the numerator step by step. The original numerator is n squared plus 2\u221an times (n+4) plus 16. \n\nSo substituting n = a\u00b2:\n\nFirst term: (a\u00b2)^2 = a^4.\n\nSecond term: 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) = 2a^3 +8a.\n\nThird term: +16. \n\nSo adding them all up: a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, that's correct. \n\nHmm, maybe I can factor the numerator. Let me see if it can be written as a quadratic in a^2? Or perhaps another way. Let me try grouping terms. Let me see:\n\na^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. Maybe group the first two terms and the last two terms:\n\n(a^4 +2a^3) + (8a +16). Factor out a^3 from first group: a^3(a + 2). From second group, factor 8: 8(a + 2). So then:\n\na^3(a +2) +8(a +2) = (a +2)(a^3 +8). \n\nWait, a^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. Since a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2). So a^3 +8 = a^3 +2^3, so that factors as (a +2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4). \n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator becomes (a+2)*(a+2)*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4). \n\nTherefore, numerator is (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4). The denominator is (a+2)^2. \n\nSo when we divide numerator by denominator, the (a+2)^2 terms cancel out. So x simplifies to (a\u00b2 - 2a +4). \n\nWait that's a big simplification! So x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. But since a is sqrt(n), substituting back, that's (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2sqrt(n) +4. Which is n -2\u221an +4. Wait, wait a second, hold on. Wait, a is sqrt(n), so a squared is n. So a squared minus 2a plus 4 is n -2sqrt(n) +4. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recap:\n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nSubstituting a = sqrt(n) gives:\n\na^4 +2a*(a\u00b2+4) +16 = a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nFactored as (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4). \n\nDenominator is (a+2)^2. So dividing, gives (a\u00b2 -2a +4). \n\nYes that seems right. So x = a\u00b2 -2a +4 = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2sqrt(n) +4 = n - 2\u221an +4. \n\nWait, but wait, that's a big simplification. So x = n - 2\u221an +4. \n\nHmm, okay. So now I need to find the range of x when n is between 36 and 72. \n\nSo let's write x = n - 2\u221an +4. Let me denote f(n) = n -2\u221an +4. We need to find the minimum and maximum of f(n) over n in [36,72].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as a function in terms of a, where a = sqrt(n). Since a is between 6 and sqrt(72) \u22488.485. So a \u2208 [6, ~8.485].\n\nSo in terms of a, x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. So f(a) = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\nSo now, to find the range of f(a) when a is between 6 and 8.485. Since this is a quadratic function in a, opening upwards (since coefficient of a\u00b2 is positive), the minimum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic ax\u00b2 +bx +c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, the quadratic is a\u00b2 term coefficient is 1, linear term is -2, so the vertex is at a = 2/(2*1) =1. \n\nBut our a is between 6 and ~8.485, which is way to the right of the vertex. Since the parabola opens upwards, the function is increasing for a >1. So on the interval [6,8.485], the function f(a) is increasing. Therefore, its minimum is at a=6 and maximum at a=8.485. \n\nTherefore, compute f(6) and f(8.485). \n\nFirst, f(6) = 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28. \n\nNow, the upper limit a is sqrt(72). Let me compute sqrt(72) exactly. sqrt(72)=sqrt(36*2)=6*sqrt(2)\u22486*1.4142\u22488.48528. \n\nSo f(a) at a=6\u221a2 is (6\u221a2)^2 -2*(6\u221a2) +4. \n\nCalculating term by term:\n\nFirst term: (6\u221a2)^2 = 36*(2) =72.\n\nSecond term: -2*(6\u221a2) = -12\u221a2 \u2248-12*1.4142\u2248-16.9704.\n\nThird term: +4. \n\nSo total is 72 -16.9704 +4 \u2248 72 +4 =76 minus 16.9704 is 59.0296. Approximately 59.03. \n\nWait, so the maximum value of x is approximately 59.03. The minimum is exactly 28. \n\nTherefore, x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 but our max is ~59, so this is too low.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 max is ~59, so 58 is close but maybe not enough. \n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 the upper limit here is higher than our max, but lower limit okay.\n\nD)28 <x<60 \u2192 28 is exactly the minimum, and 60 is higher than the max. So the actual maximum is ~59.03, which is less than 60. So D's upper bound is okay. \n\nWait, but let me check the exact value for the upper limit. Let me compute f(6\u221a2) exactly. \n\nf(a) = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\na=6\u221a2, so a squared is (6\u221a2)^2 = 36*2 =72. \n\nThen, -2a = -2*(6\u221a2) = -12\u221a2. \n\nAdding 4. So f(a) =72 -12\u221a2 +4 = 76 -12\u221a2. \n\nWe can compute 12\u221a2 exactly? Not exactly, but sqrt(2) is irrational. Let me see the exact value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express this exactly. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, hold on. Wait, when I substituted a = sqrt(n), and then the expression x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. Wait, but the original expression was (n^2 + 2\u221an(n+4)+16)/(n +4\u221an +4). \n\nWait, let me check my algebra again because maybe I made a mistake in the factoring. Let me redo the numerator and denominator steps carefully. \n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) + 16. \n\nSubstitute n = a\u00b2, so numerator is (a\u00b2)^2 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16. \n\nExpanding that:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16. \n\nNow, the denominator is n +4\u221an +4 = a\u00b2 +4a +4 = (a+2)^2. \n\nThen I factored the numerator as (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4). Let me verify that. \n\nMultiply (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4):\n\nFirst, (a+2)^2 = a\u00b2 +4a +4. \n\nMultiply that by (a\u00b2 -2a +4):\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst, a\u00b2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = a^4 -2a^3 +4a\u00b2.\n\nThen 4a*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) =4a^3 -8a\u00b2 +16a.\n\nThen 4*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) =4a\u00b2 -8a +16.\n\nAdd all together:\n\na^4 -2a^3 +4a\u00b2 +4a^3 -8a\u00b2 +16a +4a\u00b2 -8a +16.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na^4: 1 term.\n\na^3: (-2a^3 +4a^3)=2a^3.\n\na\u00b2 terms: 4a\u00b2 -8a\u00b2 +4a\u00b2 = 0.\n\na terms: 16a -8a =8a.\n\nConstants: +16.\n\nSo total: a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. Which matches the original numerator. So the factoring is correct. Therefore, the simplification to x = a\u00b2-2a +4 is correct. So that part is okay. \n\nTherefore, x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\nSo the maximum value when a is sqrt(72) is indeed 76 -12\u221a2. Let me calculate that precisely. \n\n\u221a2 is approximately 1.41421356. \n\n12*1.41421356 \u224816.9705627. \n\nSo 76 -16.9705627 = 59.0294373. So approximately 59.03. \n\nTherefore, the maximum x is about 59.03. The minimum is exactly 28. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. Since 59.03 is less than 60, the upper bound of D is acceptable. The lower bound is exactly 28, so x can be 28 or higher? Wait, but when a is exactly 6 (n=36), then x is 28. But the original question says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n can be 36, so x can be exactly 28. However, the options are written as inequalities with <, not \u2264. \n\nWait, the options are written as \"28 <x <60\" (D). So if x can be exactly 28 when n is 36, then the lower bound is not strictly greater than 28. So the inequality 28 <x would exclude 28. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nWait when n is 36, then a =6. So x=6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28. So x is exactly 28. \n\nBut the options D says \"28 < x <60\", which would not include 28. So then the correct lower bound must be 28, but since the question allows n=36, which gives x=28, the inequality must be \"x \u226528\". \n\nBut the options given do not have \"\u2264\", so maybe the options are written with strict inequalities. Then, perhaps the actual answer is E) None of these, because the minimum is 28, so the correct interval would start with 28 \u2264 x < ~59.03. Since none of the options include 28 as a possible lower bound (since all options have either 20,23,25,28 but D's lower is strict), then the answer might be E. \n\nWait let's check the options again:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these.\n\nHmm, D's lower bound is 28 <x, but x can be exactly 28. So the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x < ~59.03. Since the options require strict inequalities, the first possible lower bound that is valid is 28 is excluded. Therefore, the correct interval isn't exactly any of the options. \n\nWait but wait, maybe I miscalculated something. Let me check the upper bound again. \n\nWait when n is 72, a is sqrt(72) \u22488.485. So f(a) = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\na squared is 72. Then 72 - 2*(sqrt(72)) +4. \n\nWait sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2), so 2*sqrt(72) is 12*sqrt(2). \n\nSo 72 +4 =76 minus 12\u221a2. \n\n12\u221a2 is approximately 16.97, so 76-16.97=59.03. \n\nSo the maximum is about 59.03. \n\nSo the maximum x is less than 60, so D's upper bound of 60 is okay. \n\nBut the minimum is exactly 28, so the lower bound for x can be 28. So the interval is [28, ~59.03). \n\nBut the options given for D is 28 <x <60, so x has to be greater than 28, but x can be 28. Therefore D is incorrect. \n\nLooking at other options: \n\nC)25 <x<64: The lower bound is 25 which is okay (since 28 is higher than 25), and upper bound 64 which is higher than our max. But the upper bound is way too high, but since the question says \"satisfies\", perhaps the options are ranges that x must lie within. Since the actual maximum is ~59, the upper limit of 64 is acceptable. The lower bound of 25 is also acceptable. But then, the question is asking which of the options is correct. \n\nWait, but the problem states \"satisfies\" which of the options. So if x can be as low as 28 and up to ~59, then all options except E might be possible. Let's check each option:\n\nA) 20 <x<54 \u2192 the maximum is ~59 which is higher than 54, so A is wrong. \n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 58 is less than ~59.03, so the upper bound is not sufficient. So B is wrong.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 the upper bound is okay, lower is okay. Since the actual range is [28, ~59], which is entirely within 25 to 64. So C's range would include all possible x. \n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 lower bound is strict, but x can be 28. So D is invalid because when n=36, x is exactly 28 which is not greater than 28. \n\nE) None of these. \n\nWait, but option C says 25 <x<64. The minimum x is 28, which is greater than 25, and the maximum is less than 64. So all x values lie within 25 to 64. Therefore, option C would be correct. Wait, but the upper limit of 64 is way higher than needed, but the question is which option is correct. Since the entire range of x is within C's bounds, then C is correct. \n\nWait, but then why did I think earlier that D might be correct? Because D's lower bound is 28, but the problem is that the question's options are inequalities with strict less than and greater than. \n\nWait the problem says \"satisfies\", so the correct answer must be a range that contains all possible x. So if all x are between 28 and ~59, then any option that includes that interval is acceptable. \n\nOption C's interval is (25,64). Since 28 is greater than 25, and 59 is less than 64, the entire x range is within C's interval. So C is a valid answer. \n\nBut D's interval is (28,60), which also includes the entire range except the exact point 28. However, since x can be exactly 28 (when n=36), then the x=28 is not included in D's interval. So D is invalid. \n\nSo between C and D, which is correct? \n\nThe question is, which of the options is correct. Since C's interval includes all possible x values (since even the minimum is 28 which is above 25, and the maximum is below 64), then C is correct. \n\nWait but let me check the other options again. \n\nWait, option C says \"25 <x <64\". The minimum x is exactly 28, so 28 is greater than 25. The maximum is ~59 <64, so all x are between 25 and 64. Therefore C is correct. \n\nHmm, then why did I think earlier that D might be the answer? Because I thought the lower bound is exactly 28, but the question's options have D as starting at 28, but the problem is that x can be exactly 28. So D's interval doesn't include that. \n\nSo then the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm again. \n\nWait, let's check the original options again. \n\nOption C:25 <x <64. \n\nSince when n=36, x=28, which is >25, and when n=72, x\u224859.03 <64. So yes, all x are within C's range. \n\nBut then, the problem says \"satisfies\". So the answer must be C? \n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification of x. Let me check again. \n\nWait, x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\nWait, a is sqrt(n). So when a is 6, x is 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28. Correct. \n\nWhen a is 8.485, then x is approximately 59.03. \n\nSo the minimum x is 28, maximum ~59.03. \n\nSo C's upper limit is 64, which is way higher than needed. But since the question asks which of the options is correct, and since all x are within C's range, then C is correct. \n\nHmm, but the answer options may have a better one. Let me see the options again. \n\nWait D's upper limit is 60, which is very close to the actual maximum. So if the question is looking for the tightest possible range, but the options don't have that. \n\nWait, but the question says \"satisfies\". So as long as all x are within the option's range, the option is correct. So since C includes all x, it's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me check the initial problem again. \n\nThe numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the numerator. Let me check again. \n\nThe question says: \n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) + 16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nYes, that's how I interpreted it. So the numerator is n squared plus 2 times sqrt(n) times (n+4) plus 16. \n\nThe denominator is n plus 4\u221an plus 4. \n\nSo my steps were correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C? \n\nWait, but let me see the options again. Option C is 25 <x <64. \n\nWait but the minimum x is 28, so the lower bound is 25, which is okay. The upper is 64. \n\nBut then why is option D there? Because D has a lower bound of 28 (but strict) and upper of 60. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake here. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check when a is 6 (n=36):\n\nx = a\u00b2 -2a +4 = 36 -12 +4 =28. Correct. \n\nWhen a is 6\u221a2 (~8.485), x is 72 - 12\u221a2 +4 =76-12\u221a2. \n\n12\u221a2 is about 16.97. \n\n76-16.97 =59.03. \n\nSo the maximum is ~59.03. \n\nSo the possible x ranges from 28 to ~59.03. \n\nTherefore, the correct option must include all x in that interval. \n\nLooking at options:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, since 28 is greater than 25 and 59.03 is less than 64. \n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 the lower bound is strict (so excludes 28) but x can be exactly 28. So D is invalid. \n\nOption B:23 <x<58 \u2192 upper limit is too low (59.03 >58). \n\nOption A:20 <x<54 \u2192 also upper limit too low. \n\nThus, the correct option is C. \n\nWait, but why does the option D exist? Because 28 to ~59 is very close to D's 28 <x <60. But since the lower bound is strict, it's invalid. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait but the options given include C as an option. So the answer must be C. \n\nWait but let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, the question says 36 \u2264 n \u226472. So n can be 36 or 72, so x can be 28 and ~59.03. So the minimal x is 28 and maximum ~59.03. \n\nTherefore, the correct option must include all values from 28 up to ~59. \n\nOption C includes up to 64 which is okay, but the lower bound 25 is okay. So C is correct. \n\nHmm. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait but I initially thought D might be the answer because the upper bound is close. But since the lower bound of D is strict, it's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck. \n\nWait the numerator was n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16. \n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the terms. Let me re-express the numerator:\n\nLet me see, let me expand the numerator again. \n\nn squared plus 2\u221an*(n +4) plus 16. \n\nSo substituting n =a\u00b2 gives a^4 +2a(a\u00b2 +4) +16. \n\nYes, that's a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. \n\nThen factoring gives (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2-2a+4). \n\nDivided by denominator (a+2)^2 gives a\u00b2-2a+4. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nHmm. So the conclusion is that the correct option is C. \n\nWait but looking back, the options:\n\nC)25 <x <64 \n\nYes, since all x between 28 and ~59 are between 25 and 64. \n\nSo the answer must be C. \n\nWait but why is the option D present then? Because perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of the maximum?\n\nWait, wait, let me check the maximum again. \n\nWait, when a is sqrt(72), which is 6*sqrt(2), then:\n\nx = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\na squared is 72, so 72 -2a +4 =76-2a. \n\nWait, 2a is 2*(6\u221a2)=12\u221a2. \n\nSo 76-12\u221a2. \n\nWait, 12\u221a2 is approximately 16.97. \n\nSo 76-16.97 is 59.03. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expression for x. Let me see, the numerator after factoring is (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2-2a+4) divided by (a+2)^2, so yes, cancels to a\u00b2-2a+4. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nThen the correct answer must be option C. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. \n\nWait the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these\n\nSo, the maximum value is approximately 59.03, so the upper limit of D (60) is okay. The lower limit of D is 28, but the minimum x is exactly 28, so the interval must include 28. Since D says \"28 <x <60\", which excludes 28, it's invalid. \n\nC's lower bound is 25, which is okay, and upper 64 which is okay. \n\nThus, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So when n=72, x\u224859.03. So the maximum is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay. But since the minimum is exactly 28, D's lower bound is not okay. \n\nSo between C and D, which is correct? \n\nBecause C's upper bound is higher but includes all possible x, so C is correct. \n\nTherefore the answer is C. \n\nWait but the options might have a trick. Wait, let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"satisfies\". So the question is, which inequality must be true for all x in the given range of n. \n\nSo for all n between 36 and72, x must be in which interval. \n\nThe minimal x is 28, so any interval with lower bound less than 28 is okay, but must include the minimal x. \n\nThe options C and D are candidates. \n\nC's lower is 25, which is less than 28, so acceptable. \n\nD's lower is 28, but since x can be exactly 28, the inequality 28 <x is not true for that case. So D is not correct. \n\nSo the answer must be C. \n\nHmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought D might be the answer. The correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check one more time with an example. \n\nTake n=36, x=28. \n\nCheck the options:\n\nC says 25 <28 <64 \u2192 yes. \n\nD says 28 <28 <60 \u2192 no. \n\nTake n=72, x\u224859.03. \n\nC says 25 <59.03 <64 \u2192 yes. \n\nD says 28 <59.03 <60 \u2192 yes, but the upper bound of D is 60, which is okay. \n\nWait, but for n=72, x is ~59.03 which is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay. \n\nBut D's lower bound excludes 28. \n\nSo for all n except n=36, the x is above 28. But since the question allows n=36, then x can be exactly 28. \n\nTherefore, the inequality in D must hold for all n in [36,72], but since when n=36 it's 28 which is not greater than 28, D is invalid. \n\nTherefore C is the correct answer. \n\nHmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was D, but actually C is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check if any of the options have a lower bound of 28 with an inclusive inequality, but the options are written with strict inequalities. \n\nSo the only option that works is C. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but I'm confused because when I first thought D was close, but now I see that C is the correct one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expression for x. Let me check with n=36, x=28, and see if that's correct. \n\nOriginal expression: \n\nx = (36\u00b2 + 2*sqrt(36)*(36+4)+16)/(36 +4*sqrt(36)+4).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n36\u00b2 =1296 \n\n2*sqrt(36)=2*6=12. (36+4)=40. So 12*40=480. \n\nAdd 16: 1296 +480 +16 = 1296+496= 1792? Wait 480+16=496, so 1296+496=1792.\n\nDenominator: 36 +4*6 +4 =36+24+4=64. \n\nSo x=1792 /64 = 28. Correct. \n\nAnother test: n=49 (so a=7). \n\nCompute x: \n\na=7, so x=7\u00b2 -2*7 +4=49-14+4=39. \n\nAlternatively via original formula:\n\nn=49, so numerator:\n\n49\u00b2 + 2*sqrt(49)*(49+4)+16. \n\n49\u00b2=2401. \n\nsqrt(49)=7. 2*7*(53)= 14*53=742. \n\nAdd 16:2401+742=3143 +16=3159. \n\nDenominator:49 +4*7 +4 =49+28+4=81. \n\n3159/81 = 39. Correct. \n\nSo x=39. \n\nSo when a=7 (n=49), x=39. \n\nWhich is within C's range. \n\nAnother test: n=64, a=8. \n\nx=8\u00b2 -2*8 +4=64-16+4=52. \n\nOriginal formula:\n\nNumerator:64\u00b2 +2*8*(64+4)+16. \n\n64\u00b2=4096. \n\n2*8*(68)= 16*68=1088. \n\n1088+16=1104. \n\nTotal numerator:4096+1104=5200. \n\nDenominator:64+4*8 +4 =64+32+4=100. \n\n5200/100=52. Correct. \n\nSo when n=64, x=52. \n\nWhich is also within C's upper limit. \n\nAnother test at n=72:\n\nx\u224859.03. \n\nSo 59.03 is less than 64, so C includes it. \n\nSo yes, the answer is C. \n\nHmm, so the correct answer is C. \n\nWait but I initially thought D was possible. But the problem is that the lower bound of D is strict. \n\nTherefore the answer is C. \n\nSo the final answer is C. \n\nWait but the options list C as 25 <x <64. The minimal x is 28, so 25 is okay, and maximum ~59, so 64 is okay. So yes. \n\nThus the answer must be C. \n\nWait but the options are given as A,B,C,D,E. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\". So if the question is asking which interval x must lie in, then the correct answer is the smallest possible interval that contains all possible x. But since none of the options give that except maybe D (if the lower bound was inclusive), but since they don't, the next best is C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for x. \n\nWait, let me see the original problem again: \n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, maybe the numerator is n\u00b2 plus 2\u221an times (n+4) plus 16. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, but I have to go with what's given. \n\nSo after all that, I think the correct answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check again the upper limit for D. \n\nThe maximum x is about 59.03, so D's upper limit is 60 which is okay. But the lower bound of D is 28, which is not inclusive. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but another way to think is that the question might be expecting the student to see that the expression simplifies to x = (sqrt(n) - 2)^2 + something, but no, I think my approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression simplifies to something else? \n\nWait, let me see the numerator again. \n\nWait, numerator is n\u00b2 +2\u221an(n+4)+16. \n\nHmm, maybe that's (n + 2\u221an +4)^2? Let me check: \n\n(n +2\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 +4n\u221an +16 +4n + 4*2\u221an* something? Wait expanding:\n\nWait (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2ab +2ac +2bc. \n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me suppose that numerator is (sqrt(n^2) + something)^2. Wait perhaps it's (n + 2\u221a(n+4))^2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is (sqrt(n)^2 + 2*sqrt(n)*2 + something). Wait, but my previous approach was correct. \n\nYes, so I think the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm. So I think I've gone through all possibilities and the answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. \n\nWait the options given are:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these\n\nWait, but the minimum x is 28, so the correct interval must start at 28. However, all options except D start lower. \n\nSo the minimal x is 28, so the interval must include 28. The only options that include 28 are C (since 25 <28) and D (but D's lower bound is strict). So between C and D, C is the only one that includes 28. \n\nThe maximum is ~59.03, so the upper bound must be higher than that. \n\nOption D's upper bound is 60, which is okay. C's upper is 64 which is also okay. \n\nSo between C and D, which is the correct answer? \n\nThe question says \"satisfies\". So the answer must be the tightest interval that includes all possible x. \n\nThe minimal x is 28, so the lower bound must be \u226428, and the upper bound must be \u226559.03. \n\nThe options C and D both include all x. \n\nSo which one is the correct answer? \n\nThe problem might be looking for the tightest possible interval. \n\nD has a lower bound of 28 (but not including it) and upper 60. \n\nC has a lower of 25 and upper of 64. \n\nThe minimal x is exactly 28, so the lower bound must be \u226428. \n\nThe tightest possible lower bound is 28 (but since it's not inclusive in D), the next best is 25. \n\nThe upper bound, the minimal required is ~59.03. \n\nThe tightest upper bound is 60 (D), but since D's lower bound excludes the minimal x, it's invalid. \n\nThus, the correct answer is C, as it's the only one that includes all possible x. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. \n\nBut the problem might have a trick. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the expression simplifies to (sqrt(n)+2)^2? Let me see. \n\nWait the numerator was (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a+4). The denominator is (a+2)^2. \n\nSo x = a\u00b2-2a+4. \n\nWait, a squared minus 2a +4 can be written as (a-1)^2 +3. \n\nBut that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write x = (sqrt(n))^2 -2sqrt(n)+4 = n -2\u221an +4. \n\nWait, but when I think of x as a function of n, perhaps I can find its minimum and maximum over the interval. \n\nWait, the function x(n) = n -2\u221an +4. Let me take the derivative to find if there's any minima or maxima between 36 and72. \n\nWait, since n is between 36 and72, and the function is x(n) = n -2\u221an +4. \n\nLet me compute derivative dx/dn = 1 - (2)/(2\u221an) = 1 - 1/\u221an. \n\nSet derivative to zero: 1 -1/\u221an=0 \u2192 \u221an=1 \u2192 n=1. But 1 is outside of our interval. \n\nTherefore, the function is increasing for \u221an >1 \u2192 n>1, which is true here. So on the interval [36,72], the function is increasing. \n\nWait, wait, derivative is 1 -1/\u221an. \n\nSo when n increases, 1/\u221an decreases. \n\nAt n=36, derivative is 1 -1/6 \u22480.833>0. So the function is increasing throughout the interval. \n\nTherefore, the minimum is at n=36 (28) and maximum at n=72 (~59.03). \n\nTherefore, the range is [28, ~59.03]. \n\nSo the correct interval must include all x between 28 and ~59.03. \n\nLooking at the options, C (25<x<64) includes this interval. \n\nD (28<x<60) almost does except for the lower bound. \n\nTherefore the answer is C. \n\nSo the correct answer is C. \n\nWait but the options list C as 25 <x <64. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused why the system might think it's another option, but according to the calculations, C is correct. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the function being increasing. Let me see:\n\nIf the function is increasing, then yes, the minimum is at n=36. \n\nThus, I think I must conclude that the correct answer is C. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the question is about finding the range of x given that n is between 36 and 72 inclusive. The expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). I need to simplify this expression first, maybe factor it somehow. Let me see.\n\nWait, the numerator is n squared plus 2 times sqrt(n) times (n+4) plus 16? Wait, maybe I should parse that again. Let me make sure I got the expression right. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4. \n\nHmm. Let me see if I can factor numerator and denominator as some squares. Because the structure looks similar to a quadratic in terms of sqrt(n). Let me think of substituting variables here. Let\u2019s let\u2019s set a = sqrt(n). Since n is between 36 and 72, a would be between 6 and sqrt(72). Wait sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) which is approximately 8.485. So a is between 6 and about 8.485. \n\nSo substituting a = sqrt(n), then n = a\u00b2. Let me rewrite the numerator and denominator in terms of a.\n\nNumerator: (a\u00b2)^2 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16. Wait, let me compute that step by step. Wait, the original numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an*(n +4) +16. Substituting n =a\u00b2, that becomes (a\u00b2)^2 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16. Let's expand that:\n\nFirst term: a^4.\n\nSecond term: 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) = 2a^3 +8a.\n\nThird term: +16.\n\nSo numerator is a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16? Wait, hold on. Wait, adding all together: a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16? Hmm, that's the numerator. \n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4 = a\u00b2 +4a +4. Which looks like (a +2)^2. Oh, that's a perfect square. Because (a +2)^2 = a\u00b2 +4a +4. So denominator simplifies to (a +2)^2. \n\nNow the numerator: let's see if that can be factored. Hmm, a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. Wait, maybe grouping terms?\n\nLet me see: Let me try to see if the numerator can be written as (a^2 + something)^2 or something similar. Let me check.\n\nWait, let's think again. Maybe I made a mistake in expanding the numerator. Let me re-calculate the numerator step by step. The original numerator is n squared plus 2\u221an times (n+4) plus 16. \n\nSo substituting n = a\u00b2:\n\nFirst term: (a\u00b2)^2 = a^4.\n\nSecond term: 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) = 2a^3 +8a.\n\nThird term: +16. \n\nSo adding them all up: a^4 + 2a^3 +8a +16. Hmm, that's correct. \n\nHmm, maybe I can factor the numerator. Let me see if it can be written as a quadratic in a^2? Or perhaps another way. Let me try grouping terms. Let me see:\n\na^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. Maybe group the first two terms and the last two terms:\n\n(a^4 +2a^3) + (8a +16). Factor out a^3 from first group: a^3(a + 2). From second group, factor 8: 8(a + 2). So then:\n\na^3(a +2) +8(a +2) = (a +2)(a^3 +8). \n\nWait, a^3 +8 is a sum of cubes. Since a^3 + b^3 = (a + b)(a\u00b2 -ab +b\u00b2). So a^3 +8 = a^3 +2^3, so that factors as (a +2)(a\u00b2 -2a +4). \n\nSo putting it all together, the numerator becomes (a+2)*(a+2)*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4). \n\nTherefore, numerator is (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4). The denominator is (a+2)^2. \n\nSo when we divide numerator by denominator, the (a+2)^2 terms cancel out. So x simplifies to (a\u00b2 - 2a +4). \n\nWait that's a big simplification! So x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. But since a is sqrt(n), substituting back, that's (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2sqrt(n) +4. Which is n -2\u221an +4. Wait, wait a second, hold on. Wait, a is sqrt(n), so a squared is n. So a squared minus 2a plus 4 is n -2sqrt(n) +4. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recap:\n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nSubstituting a = sqrt(n) gives:\n\na^4 +2a*(a\u00b2+4) +16 = a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16.\n\nFactored as (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4). \n\nDenominator is (a+2)^2. So dividing, gives (a\u00b2 -2a +4). \n\nYes that seems right. So x = a\u00b2 -2a +4 = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2sqrt(n) +4 = n - 2\u221an +4. \n\nWait, but wait, that's a big simplification. So x = n - 2\u221an +4. \n\nHmm, okay. So now I need to find the range of x when n is between 36 and 72. \n\nSo let's write x = n - 2\u221an +4. Let me denote f(n) = n -2\u221an +4. We need to find the minimum and maximum of f(n) over n in [36,72].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as a function in terms of a, where a = sqrt(n). Since a is between 6 and sqrt(72) \u22488.485. So a \u2208 [6, ~8.485].\n\nSo in terms of a, x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. So f(a) = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\nSo now, to find the range of f(a) when a is between 6 and 8.485. Since this is a quadratic function in a, opening upwards (since coefficient of a\u00b2 is positive), the minimum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a quadratic ax\u00b2 +bx +c is at x = -b/(2a). Here, the quadratic is a\u00b2 term coefficient is 1, linear term is -2, so the vertex is at a = 2/(2*1) =1. \n\nBut our a is between 6 and ~8.485, which is way to the right of the vertex. Since the parabola opens upwards, the function is increasing for a >1. So on the interval [6,8.485], the function f(a) is increasing. Therefore, its minimum is at a=6 and maximum at a=8.485. \n\nTherefore, compute f(6) and f(8.485). \n\nFirst, f(6) = 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28. \n\nNow, the upper limit a is sqrt(72). Let me compute sqrt(72) exactly. sqrt(72)=sqrt(36*2)=6*sqrt(2)\u22486*1.4142\u22488.48528. \n\nSo f(a) at a=6\u221a2 is (6\u221a2)^2 -2*(6\u221a2) +4. \n\nCalculating term by term:\n\nFirst term: (6\u221a2)^2 = 36*(2) =72.\n\nSecond term: -2*(6\u221a2) = -12\u221a2 \u2248-12*1.4142\u2248-16.9704.\n\nThird term: +4. \n\nSo total is 72 -16.9704 +4 \u2248 72 +4 =76 minus 16.9704 is 59.0296. Approximately 59.03. \n\nWait, so the maximum value of x is approximately 59.03. The minimum is exactly 28. \n\nTherefore, x ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 but our max is ~59, so this is too low.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 max is ~59, so 58 is close but maybe not enough. \n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 the upper limit here is higher than our max, but lower limit okay.\n\nD)28 <x<60 \u2192 28 is exactly the minimum, and 60 is higher than the max. So the actual maximum is ~59.03, which is less than 60. So D's upper bound is okay. \n\nWait, but let me check the exact value for the upper limit. Let me compute f(6\u221a2) exactly. \n\nf(a) = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\na=6\u221a2, so a squared is (6\u221a2)^2 = 36*2 =72. \n\nThen, -2a = -2*(6\u221a2) = -12\u221a2. \n\nAdding 4. So f(a) =72 -12\u221a2 +4 = 76 -12\u221a2. \n\nWe can compute 12\u221a2 exactly? Not exactly, but sqrt(2) is irrational. Let me see the exact value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a way to express this exactly. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, hold on. Wait, when I substituted a = sqrt(n), and then the expression x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. Wait, but the original expression was (n^2 + 2\u221an(n+4)+16)/(n +4\u221an +4). \n\nWait, let me check my algebra again because maybe I made a mistake in the factoring. Let me redo the numerator and denominator steps carefully. \n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) + 16. \n\nSubstitute n = a\u00b2, so numerator is (a\u00b2)^2 + 2a*(a\u00b2 +4) +16. \n\nExpanding that:\n\na^4 + 2a^3 + 8a +16. \n\nNow, the denominator is n +4\u221an +4 = a\u00b2 +4a +4 = (a+2)^2. \n\nThen I factored the numerator as (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4). Let me verify that. \n\nMultiply (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4):\n\nFirst, (a+2)^2 = a\u00b2 +4a +4. \n\nMultiply that by (a\u00b2 -2a +4):\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst, a\u00b2*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) = a^4 -2a^3 +4a\u00b2.\n\nThen 4a*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) =4a^3 -8a\u00b2 +16a.\n\nThen 4*(a\u00b2 -2a +4) =4a\u00b2 -8a +16.\n\nAdd all together:\n\na^4 -2a^3 +4a\u00b2 +4a^3 -8a\u00b2 +16a +4a\u00b2 -8a +16.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na^4: 1 term.\n\na^3: (-2a^3 +4a^3)=2a^3.\n\na\u00b2 terms: 4a\u00b2 -8a\u00b2 +4a\u00b2 = 0.\n\na terms: 16a -8a =8a.\n\nConstants: +16.\n\nSo total: a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. Which matches the original numerator. So the factoring is correct. Therefore, the simplification to x = a\u00b2-2a +4 is correct. So that part is okay. \n\nTherefore, x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\nSo the maximum value when a is sqrt(72) is indeed 76 -12\u221a2. Let me calculate that precisely. \n\n\u221a2 is approximately 1.41421356. \n\n12*1.41421356 \u224816.9705627. \n\nSo 76 -16.9705627 = 59.0294373. So approximately 59.03. \n\nTherefore, the maximum x is about 59.03. The minimum is exactly 28. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. Since 59.03 is less than 60, the upper bound of D is acceptable. The lower bound is exactly 28, so x can be 28 or higher? Wait, but when a is exactly 6 (n=36), then x is 28. But the original question says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n can be 36, so x can be exactly 28. However, the options are written as inequalities with <, not \u2264. \n\nWait, the options are written as \"28 <x <60\" (D). So if x can be exactly 28 when n is 36, then the lower bound is not strictly greater than 28. So the inequality 28 <x would exclude 28. \n\nHmm, this is a problem. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nWait when n is 36, then a =6. So x=6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28. So x is exactly 28. \n\nBut the options D says \"28 < x <60\", which would not include 28. So then the correct lower bound must be 28, but since the question allows n=36, which gives x=28, the inequality must be \"x \u226528\". \n\nBut the options given do not have \"\u2264\", so maybe the options are written with strict inequalities. Then, perhaps the actual answer is E) None of these, because the minimum is 28, so the correct interval would start with 28 \u2264 x < ~59.03. Since none of the options include 28 as a possible lower bound (since all options have either 20,23,25,28 but D's lower is strict), then the answer might be E. \n\nWait let's check the options again:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these.\n\nHmm, D's lower bound is 28 <x, but x can be exactly 28. So the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x < ~59.03. Since the options require strict inequalities, the first possible lower bound that is valid is 28 is excluded. Therefore, the correct interval isn't exactly any of the options. \n\nWait but wait, maybe I miscalculated something. Let me check the upper bound again. \n\nWait when n is 72, a is sqrt(72) \u22488.485. So f(a) = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\na squared is 72. Then 72 - 2*(sqrt(72)) +4. \n\nWait sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2), so 2*sqrt(72) is 12*sqrt(2). \n\nSo 72 +4 =76 minus 12\u221a2. \n\n12\u221a2 is approximately 16.97, so 76-16.97=59.03. \n\nSo the maximum is about 59.03. \n\nSo the maximum x is less than 60, so D's upper bound of 60 is okay. \n\nBut the minimum is exactly 28, so the lower bound for x can be 28. So the interval is [28, ~59.03). \n\nBut the options given for D is 28 <x <60, so x has to be greater than 28, but x can be 28. Therefore D is incorrect. \n\nLooking at other options: \n\nC)25 <x<64: The lower bound is 25 which is okay (since 28 is higher than 25), and upper bound 64 which is higher than our max. But the upper bound is way too high, but since the question says \"satisfies\", perhaps the options are ranges that x must lie within. Since the actual maximum is ~59, the upper limit of 64 is acceptable. The lower bound of 25 is also acceptable. But then, the question is asking which of the options is correct. \n\nWait, but the problem states \"satisfies\" which of the options. So if x can be as low as 28 and up to ~59, then all options except E might be possible. Let's check each option:\n\nA) 20 <x<54 \u2192 the maximum is ~59 which is higher than 54, so A is wrong. \n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 58 is less than ~59.03, so the upper bound is not sufficient. So B is wrong.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 the upper bound is okay, lower is okay. Since the actual range is [28, ~59], which is entirely within 25 to 64. So C's range would include all possible x. \n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 lower bound is strict, but x can be 28. So D is invalid because when n=36, x is exactly 28 which is not greater than 28. \n\nE) None of these. \n\nWait, but option C says 25 <x<64. The minimum x is 28, which is greater than 25, and the maximum is less than 64. So all x values lie within 25 to 64. Therefore, option C would be correct. Wait, but the upper limit of 64 is way higher than needed, but the question is which option is correct. Since the entire range of x is within C's bounds, then C is correct. \n\nWait, but then why did I think earlier that D might be correct? Because D's lower bound is 28, but the problem is that the question's options are inequalities with strict less than and greater than. \n\nWait the problem says \"satisfies\", so the correct answer must be a range that contains all possible x. So if all x are between 28 and ~59, then any option that includes that interval is acceptable. \n\nOption C's interval is (25,64). Since 28 is greater than 25, and 59 is less than 64, the entire x range is within C's interval. So C is a valid answer. \n\nBut D's interval is (28,60), which also includes the entire range except the exact point 28. However, since x can be exactly 28 (when n=36), then the x=28 is not included in D's interval. So D is invalid. \n\nSo between C and D, which is correct? \n\nThe question is, which of the options is correct. Since C's interval includes all possible x values (since even the minimum is 28 which is above 25, and the maximum is below 64), then C is correct. \n\nWait but let me check the other options again. \n\nWait, option C says \"25 <x <64\". The minimum x is exactly 28, so 28 is greater than 25. The maximum is ~59 <64, so all x are between 25 and 64. Therefore C is correct. \n\nHmm, then why did I think earlier that D might be the answer? Because I thought the lower bound is exactly 28, but the question's options have D as starting at 28, but the problem is that x can be exactly 28. So D's interval doesn't include that. \n\nSo then the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but I need to confirm again. \n\nWait, let's check the original options again. \n\nOption C:25 <x <64. \n\nSince when n=36, x=28, which is >25, and when n=72, x\u224859.03 <64. So yes, all x are within C's range. \n\nBut then, the problem says \"satisfies\". So the answer must be C? \n\nBut wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification of x. Let me check again. \n\nWait, x = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\nWait, a is sqrt(n). So when a is 6, x is 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 =36-12+4=28. Correct. \n\nWhen a is 8.485, then x is approximately 59.03. \n\nSo the minimum x is 28, maximum ~59.03. \n\nSo C's upper limit is 64, which is way higher than needed. But since the question asks which of the options is correct, and since all x are within C's range, then C is correct. \n\nHmm, but the answer options may have a better one. Let me see the options again. \n\nWait D's upper limit is 60, which is very close to the actual maximum. So if the question is looking for the tightest possible range, but the options don't have that. \n\nWait, but the question says \"satisfies\". So as long as all x are within the option's range, the option is correct. So since C includes all x, it's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me check the initial problem again. \n\nThe numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. \n\nWait, maybe I misread the numerator. Let me check again. \n\nThe question says: \n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) + 16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nYes, that's how I interpreted it. So the numerator is n squared plus 2 times sqrt(n) times (n+4) plus 16. \n\nThe denominator is n plus 4\u221an plus 4. \n\nSo my steps were correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C? \n\nWait, but let me see the options again. Option C is 25 <x <64. \n\nWait but the minimum x is 28, so the lower bound is 25, which is okay. The upper is 64. \n\nBut then why is option D there? Because D has a lower bound of 28 (but strict) and upper of 60. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's a mistake here. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check when a is 6 (n=36):\n\nx = a\u00b2 -2a +4 = 36 -12 +4 =28. Correct. \n\nWhen a is 6\u221a2 (~8.485), x is 72 - 12\u221a2 +4 =76-12\u221a2. \n\n12\u221a2 is about 16.97. \n\n76-16.97 =59.03. \n\nSo the maximum is ~59.03. \n\nSo the possible x ranges from 28 to ~59.03. \n\nTherefore, the correct option must include all x in that interval. \n\nLooking at options:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, since 28 is greater than 25 and 59.03 is less than 64. \n\nOption D: 28 <x <60 \u2192 the lower bound is strict (so excludes 28) but x can be exactly 28. So D is invalid. \n\nOption B:23 <x<58 \u2192 upper limit is too low (59.03 >58). \n\nOption A:20 <x<54 \u2192 also upper limit too low. \n\nThus, the correct option is C. \n\nWait, but why does the option D exist? Because 28 to ~59 is very close to D's 28 <x <60. But since the lower bound is strict, it's invalid. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait but the options given include C as an option. So the answer must be C. \n\nWait but let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, the question says 36 \u2264 n \u226472. So n can be 36 or 72, so x can be 28 and ~59.03. So the minimal x is 28 and maximum ~59.03. \n\nTherefore, the correct option must include all values from 28 up to ~59. \n\nOption C includes up to 64 which is okay, but the lower bound 25 is okay. So C is correct. \n\nHmm. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait but I initially thought D might be the answer because the upper bound is close. But since the lower bound of D is strict, it's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me recheck. \n\nWait the numerator was n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16. \n\nWait, perhaps I misapplied the terms. Let me re-express the numerator:\n\nLet me see, let me expand the numerator again. \n\nn squared plus 2\u221an*(n +4) plus 16. \n\nSo substituting n =a\u00b2 gives a^4 +2a(a\u00b2 +4) +16. \n\nYes, that's a^4 +2a^3 +8a +16. \n\nThen factoring gives (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2-2a+4). \n\nDivided by denominator (a+2)^2 gives a\u00b2-2a+4. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nHmm. So the conclusion is that the correct option is C. \n\nWait but looking back, the options:\n\nC)25 <x <64 \n\nYes, since all x between 28 and ~59 are between 25 and 64. \n\nSo the answer must be C. \n\nWait but why is the option D present then? Because perhaps I made a mistake in calculation of the maximum?\n\nWait, wait, let me check the maximum again. \n\nWait, when a is sqrt(72), which is 6*sqrt(2), then:\n\nx = a\u00b2 -2a +4. \n\na squared is 72, so 72 -2a +4 =76-2a. \n\nWait, 2a is 2*(6\u221a2)=12\u221a2. \n\nSo 76-12\u221a2. \n\nWait, 12\u221a2 is approximately 16.97. \n\nSo 76-16.97 is 59.03. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expression for x. Let me see, the numerator after factoring is (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2-2a+4) divided by (a+2)^2, so yes, cancels to a\u00b2-2a+4. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nThen the correct answer must be option C. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. \n\nWait the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these\n\nSo, the maximum value is approximately 59.03, so the upper limit of D (60) is okay. The lower limit of D is 28, but the minimum x is exactly 28, so the interval must include 28. Since D says \"28 <x <60\", which excludes 28, it's invalid. \n\nC's lower bound is 25, which is okay, and upper 64 which is okay. \n\nThus, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but maybe there's another mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So when n=72, x\u224859.03. So the maximum is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay. But since the minimum is exactly 28, D's lower bound is not okay. \n\nSo between C and D, which is correct? \n\nBecause C's upper bound is higher but includes all possible x, so C is correct. \n\nTherefore the answer is C. \n\nWait but the options might have a trick. Wait, let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"satisfies\". So the question is, which inequality must be true for all x in the given range of n. \n\nSo for all n between 36 and72, x must be in which interval. \n\nThe minimal x is 28, so any interval with lower bound less than 28 is okay, but must include the minimal x. \n\nThe options C and D are candidates. \n\nC's lower is 25, which is less than 28, so acceptable. \n\nD's lower is 28, but since x can be exactly 28, the inequality 28 <x is not true for that case. So D is not correct. \n\nSo the answer must be C. \n\nHmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought D might be the answer. The correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check one more time with an example. \n\nTake n=36, x=28. \n\nCheck the options:\n\nC says 25 <28 <64 \u2192 yes. \n\nD says 28 <28 <60 \u2192 no. \n\nTake n=72, x\u224859.03. \n\nC says 25 <59.03 <64 \u2192 yes. \n\nD says 28 <59.03 <60 \u2192 yes, but the upper bound of D is 60, which is okay. \n\nWait, but for n=72, x is ~59.03 which is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay. \n\nBut D's lower bound excludes 28. \n\nSo for all n except n=36, the x is above 28. But since the question allows n=36, then x can be exactly 28. \n\nTherefore, the inequality in D must hold for all n in [36,72], but since when n=36 it's 28 which is not greater than 28, D is invalid. \n\nTherefore C is the correct answer. \n\nHmm, so I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought it was D, but actually C is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check if any of the options have a lower bound of 28 with an inclusive inequality, but the options are written with strict inequalities. \n\nSo the only option that works is C. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but I'm confused because when I first thought D was close, but now I see that C is the correct one. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the expression for x. Let me check with n=36, x=28, and see if that's correct. \n\nOriginal expression: \n\nx = (36\u00b2 + 2*sqrt(36)*(36+4)+16)/(36 +4*sqrt(36)+4).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n36\u00b2 =1296 \n\n2*sqrt(36)=2*6=12. (36+4)=40. So 12*40=480. \n\nAdd 16: 1296 +480 +16 = 1296+496= 1792? Wait 480+16=496, so 1296+496=1792.\n\nDenominator: 36 +4*6 +4 =36+24+4=64. \n\nSo x=1792 /64 = 28. Correct. \n\nAnother test: n=49 (so a=7). \n\nCompute x: \n\na=7, so x=7\u00b2 -2*7 +4=49-14+4=39. \n\nAlternatively via original formula:\n\nn=49, so numerator:\n\n49\u00b2 + 2*sqrt(49)*(49+4)+16. \n\n49\u00b2=2401. \n\nsqrt(49)=7. 2*7*(53)= 14*53=742. \n\nAdd 16:2401+742=3143 +16=3159. \n\nDenominator:49 +4*7 +4 =49+28+4=81. \n\n3159/81 = 39. Correct. \n\nSo x=39. \n\nSo when a=7 (n=49), x=39. \n\nWhich is within C's range. \n\nAnother test: n=64, a=8. \n\nx=8\u00b2 -2*8 +4=64-16+4=52. \n\nOriginal formula:\n\nNumerator:64\u00b2 +2*8*(64+4)+16. \n\n64\u00b2=4096. \n\n2*8*(68)= 16*68=1088. \n\n1088+16=1104. \n\nTotal numerator:4096+1104=5200. \n\nDenominator:64+4*8 +4 =64+32+4=100. \n\n5200/100=52. Correct. \n\nSo when n=64, x=52. \n\nWhich is also within C's upper limit. \n\nAnother test at n=72:\n\nx\u224859.03. \n\nSo 59.03 is less than 64, so C includes it. \n\nSo yes, the answer is C. \n\nHmm, so the correct answer is C. \n\nWait but I initially thought D was possible. But the problem is that the lower bound of D is strict. \n\nTherefore the answer is C. \n\nSo the final answer is C. \n\nWait but the options list C as 25 <x <64. The minimal x is 28, so 25 is okay, and maximum ~59, so 64 is okay. So yes. \n\nThus the answer must be C. \n\nWait but the options are given as A,B,C,D,E. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\". So if the question is asking which interval x must lie in, then the correct answer is the smallest possible interval that contains all possible x. But since none of the options give that except maybe D (if the lower bound was inclusive), but since they don't, the next best is C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for x. \n\nWait, let me see the original problem again: \n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nWait, maybe the numerator is n\u00b2 plus 2\u221an times (n+4) plus 16. \n\nWait, perhaps the user made a typo, but I have to go with what's given. \n\nSo after all that, I think the correct answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check again the upper limit for D. \n\nThe maximum x is about 59.03, so D's upper limit is 60 which is okay. But the lower bound of D is 28, which is not inclusive. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but another way to think is that the question might be expecting the student to see that the expression simplifies to x = (sqrt(n) - 2)^2 + something, but no, I think my approach is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression simplifies to something else? \n\nWait, let me see the numerator again. \n\nWait, numerator is n\u00b2 +2\u221an(n+4)+16. \n\nHmm, maybe that's (n + 2\u221an +4)^2? Let me check: \n\n(n +2\u221an +4)^2 = n\u00b2 +4n\u221an +16 +4n + 4*2\u221an* something? Wait expanding:\n\nWait (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2 +2ab +2ac +2bc. \n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me suppose that numerator is (sqrt(n^2) + something)^2. Wait perhaps it's (n + 2\u221a(n+4))^2? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is (sqrt(n)^2 + 2*sqrt(n)*2 + something). Wait, but my previous approach was correct. \n\nYes, so I think the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm. So I think I've gone through all possibilities and the answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. \n\nWait the options given are:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these\n\nWait, but the minimum x is 28, so the correct interval must start at 28. However, all options except D start lower. \n\nSo the minimal x is 28, so the interval must include 28. The only options that include 28 are C (since 25 <28) and D (but D's lower bound is strict). So between C and D, C is the only one that includes 28. \n\nThe maximum is ~59.03, so the upper bound must be higher than that. \n\nOption D's upper bound is 60, which is okay. C's upper is 64 which is also okay. \n\nSo between C and D, which is the correct answer? \n\nThe question says \"satisfies\". So the answer must be the tightest interval that includes all possible x. \n\nThe minimal x is 28, so the lower bound must be \u226428, and the upper bound must be \u226559.03. \n\nThe options C and D both include all x. \n\nSo which one is the correct answer? \n\nThe problem might be looking for the tightest possible interval. \n\nD has a lower bound of 28 (but not including it) and upper 60. \n\nC has a lower of 25 and upper of 64. \n\nThe minimal x is exactly 28, so the lower bound must be \u226428. \n\nThe tightest possible lower bound is 28 (but since it's not inclusive in D), the next best is 25. \n\nThe upper bound, the minimal required is ~59.03. \n\nThe tightest upper bound is 60 (D), but since D's lower bound excludes the minimal x, it's invalid. \n\nThus, the correct answer is C, as it's the only one that includes all possible x. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. \n\nBut the problem might have a trick. Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe the expression simplifies to (sqrt(n)+2)^2? Let me see. \n\nWait the numerator was (a+2)^2*(a\u00b2 -2a+4). The denominator is (a+2)^2. \n\nSo x = a\u00b2-2a+4. \n\nWait, a squared minus 2a +4 can be written as (a-1)^2 +3. \n\nBut that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write x = (sqrt(n))^2 -2sqrt(n)+4 = n -2\u221an +4. \n\nWait, but when I think of x as a function of n, perhaps I can find its minimum and maximum over the interval. \n\nWait, the function x(n) = n -2\u221an +4. Let me take the derivative to find if there's any minima or maxima between 36 and72. \n\nWait, since n is between 36 and72, and the function is x(n) = n -2\u221an +4. \n\nLet me compute derivative dx/dn = 1 - (2)/(2\u221an) = 1 - 1/\u221an. \n\nSet derivative to zero: 1 -1/\u221an=0 \u2192 \u221an=1 \u2192 n=1. But 1 is outside of our interval. \n\nTherefore, the function is increasing for \u221an >1 \u2192 n>1, which is true here. So on the interval [36,72], the function is increasing. \n\nWait, wait, derivative is 1 -1/\u221an. \n\nSo when n increases, 1/\u221an decreases. \n\nAt n=36, derivative is 1 -1/6 \u22480.833>0. So the function is increasing throughout the interval. \n\nTherefore, the minimum is at n=36 (28) and maximum at n=72 (~59.03). \n\nTherefore, the range is [28, ~59.03]. \n\nSo the correct interval must include all x between 28 and ~59.03. \n\nLooking at the options, C (25<x<64) includes this interval. \n\nD (28<x<60) almost does except for the lower bound. \n\nTherefore the answer is C. \n\nSo the correct answer is C. \n\nWait but the options list C as 25 <x <64. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm, but I'm a bit confused why the system might think it's another option, but according to the calculations, C is correct. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the function being increasing. Let me see:\n\nIf the function is increasing, then yes, the minimum is at n=36. \n\nThus, I think I must conclude that the correct answer is C. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\nLet \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = a^2 \\). Substituting \\( a \\) into the expression, the numerator becomes:\n\n\\[\na^4 + 2a(a^2 + 4) + 16 = a^4 + 2a^3 + 8a + 16\n\\]\n\nThe denominator becomes:\n\n\\[\na^2 + 4a + 4 = (a + 2)^2\n\\]\n\nFactoring the numerator, we notice it can be written as:\n\n\\[\n(a + 2)^2(a^2 - 2a + 4)\n\\]\n\nThus, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(a + 2)^2(a^2 - 2a + 4)}{(a + 2)^2} = a^2 - 2a + 4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\), we get:\n\n\\[\nx = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4\n\\]\n\nNext, we determine the range of \\( x \\) for \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\). Let \\( a = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( a \\) ranges from \\( 6 \\) to \\( \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485 \\). The function \\( x = a^2 - 2a + 4 \\) is a quadratic in \\( a \\) that is increasing for \\( a > 1 \\) (since its derivative \\( 2a - 2 \\) is positive for \\( a > 1 \\)). Therefore, the minimum occurs at \\( a = 6 \\) and the maximum at \\( a \\approx 8.485 \\):\n\n- **Minimum value at \\( a = 6 \\):**  \n  \\( x = 6^2 - 2(6) + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28 \\)\n\n- **Maximum value at \\( a = \\sqrt{72} \\):**  \n  \\( x = (\\sqrt{72})^2 - 2\\sqrt{72} + 4 = 72 - 12\\sqrt{2} + 4 \\approx 59.03 \\)\n\nThe range of \\( x \\) is approximately \\( 28 \\leq x < 59.03 \\). Evaluating the options:\n\n- **Option C (25 < x < 64):** Includes all values from 28 to ~59.03.  \n- **Option D (28 < x < 60):** Excludes the minimum value of 28 and is invalid.  \n- Other options (A, B, E) either have insufficient upper/lower bounds or are too strict.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C**, as it fully contains the valid range of \\( x \\).\n\nAnswer: C",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which interval x falls into, given that n is between 36 and 72. The expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can simplify it first.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator and denominator can be factored? Let me look at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me write that out again. Oh, maybe that's a perfect square? Let me check. Like, if I have something squared, like (\u221an + a)^2. Let's see: expanding that would give n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2. Comparing that to the numerator, which is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Wait, the first term in the numerator is n squared, so maybe my initial thought is wrong.\n\nWait a second, maybe there's a different way to see this. Let me write the numerator again:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16.\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me think of variables here. Let me let t = \u221an. Then n = t\u00b2. Maybe substituting that in would help. Let's try that substitution.\n\nSo substituting t = \u221an, then the numerator becomes:\n\n(t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nt^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16\n\n= t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t +16.\n\nHmm, not sure that helps yet. What about the denominator?\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4. Substituting t gives:\n\nt\u00b2 + 4t +4. Oh! That's a perfect square: (t + 2)^2. Nice!\n\nSo denominator simplifies to (t + 2)^2. Let me see the numerator again.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator can also be expressed as a square? Let's see. Let me think of the numerator with t substitution again:\n\nNumerator is t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, maybe not obvious. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in substituting. Let me check the numerator again. The original numerator was n\u00b2 + 2\u221an*(n+4) +16. Wait, so when substituting t = \u221an, that term is 2t*(n +4). But n is t\u00b2, so n+4 is t\u00b2 +4. So yes, the numerator is indeed t^4 +2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16. Let me expand that:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator is (t^2 + a t + b)^2? Let me try expanding that:\n\n(t^2 + a t + b)^2 = t^4 + 2a t^3 + (a\u00b2 + 2b) t^2 + 2ab t + b\u00b2.\n\nComparing to numerator: t^4 +2t^3 +0 t^2 +8t +16. So coefficients:\n\n2a =2 \u2192 a=1.\n\nThen, a\u00b2 +2b must equal 0 (since there's no t\u00b2 term). Since a=1, 1 +2b =0 \u2192 2b = -1 \u2192 b= -0.5. But then 2ab t term would be 2*(1)*(-0.5) t = -t, but in our numerator it's +8t, so that doesn't work. Hmm. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (t^2 + something)(something else). Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps there's another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original expression can be simplified as (something squared) over (something squared). Let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in substituting variables. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me see: perhaps that's equal to (n + 2\u221a(n +4))\u00b2? Wait, let me check.\n\nLet me expand (n + 2\u221a(n +4))\u00b2: that would be n\u00b2 +4n\u221a(n+4) +4(n+4). Which is n\u00b2 +4n\u221a(n+4)+4n+16. Not the same as the numerator. Hmm, not quite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ( \u221an(n) + something ) squared? Wait, perhaps the numerator can be written as ( \u221an^2 + 2\u221an * sqrt(n+4) + (sqrt(n+4))^2 )? Wait, but that would be (sqrt(n\u00b2) + sqrt(n+4))^2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator can be thought of as (n + 2\u221a(n) * something + ...). Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a fraction and see if it simplifies.\n\nThe denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let me factor that as (\u221an + 2)^2, which I had earlier. The numerator: maybe I can write it as (something squared). Let me see.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me see if that can be expressed as (n + something)^2. Let me try:\n\nSuppose it's (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Let me expand that:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2a n^{3/2} + 2b n + a\u00b2 n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2. Hmm, comparing to numerator's terms:\n\nThe numerator has n\u00b2, terms with \u221an*(n+4), and 16. Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different substitution. Let me think of the entire expression x = numerator/denominator. Let me see if I can factor numerator and denominator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (n + 2\u221a(n +4))^2? Wait, let me compute that:\n\n(n + 2\u221a(n+4))\u00b2 = n\u00b2 +4n\u221a(n+4) +4(n+4) = n\u00b2 +4n\u221a(n+4)+4n+16. Hmm, which is different from the numerator given here. The original numerator has 2\u221an(n+4) instead of 4n\u221a(n+4). So that's not the same.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to try plugging in numbers. Since n is between 36 and 72, let me pick n=36 and n=72 and see what x is. Then check which interval it falls into. Maybe that can help.\n\nWait, but since the options are ranges, maybe the expression simplifies to a linear function of n, so the minimum and maximum can be found by evaluating at endpoints. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression simplifies to (\u221an + something)^2 over (\u221an + 2)^2. Let me try that.\n\nLet me go back to the substitution t = \u221an. Then, the denominator is (t +2)^2. The numerator is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm. Wait, maybe numerator can be expressed as (t^2 + t + 4)^2? Let me check:\n\n(t^2 + t +4)^2 = t^4 + 2t^3 + (1 + 8)t\u00b2 + 8t +16. Wait, that gives a t\u00b2 term which isn't present in the numerator. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (t^2 + a)^2 + ...? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps numerator is (t^3 + something)(something else). Hmm, this might not be the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor numerator as t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. Let me see if there are any roots. Let me plug t = -2. Then:\n\n(-2)^4 + 2*(-2)^3 +8*(-2)+16 = 16 -16 -16 +16 = 0. Oh! So t = -2 is a root. Therefore, (t +2) is a factor.\n\nSo let's perform polynomial division. Divide numerator by (t +2).\n\nNumerator: t^4 +2t^3 +0t^2 +8t +16.\n\nDivide by t +2:\n\nUsing synthetic division for t = -2:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (t^4), 2 (t^3), 0 (t^2), 8 (t), 16 (constant).\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply by -2: 1*(-2) = -2. Add to next coefficient: 2 + (-2) =0.\n\nMultiply by -2: 0*(-2)=0. Add to next coefficient (0) \u2192 0.\n\nMultiply by -2 \u21920. Add to next coefficient 8 \u21928.\n\nMultiply by -2 \u2192 -16. Add to 16 \u21920. So the remainder is zero, so the division works.\n\nTherefore, the numerator factors into (t+2)(t^3 +0t^2 +0t +8) \u2192 (t+2)(t^3 +8). Now, t^3 +8 can be factored as (t +2)(t^2 - 2t +4). So overall, numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4).\n\nSo numerator is (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4). The denominator is (t+2)^2. Therefore, x = numerator/denominator = (t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nOh! So that simplifies things a lot! So x = t\u00b2 -2t +4, where t = \u221an. Since t is \u221an and n is between 36 and72, then t is between \u221a36=6 and \u221a72\u22488.485 (since 8.485 squared is 72). Wait, \u221a72 is exactly 6*sqrt(2) which is about 8.485.\n\nSo substituting back, x = ( (\u221an)^2 ) -2\u221an +4 \u2192 n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, no. Wait, t is \u221an, so t squared is n. So x = (t squared) -2t +4 \u2192 which is n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, that's right. So x simplifies to n -2\u221an +4. That's a much simpler expression!\n\nWow, so that simplifies everything. So instead of dealing with the original complex fraction, we can just work with x = n -2\u221an +4. Now, since 36 \u2264n \u226472, let's compute x for the endpoints and maybe the middle to see the range.\n\nFirst, let's compute when n=36:\n\nx =36 -2*6 +4 =36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nWhen n=72:\n\nx=72 -2*sqrt(72)+4. Let me compute sqrt(72). sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. So 2*8.485\u224816.97. So 72-16.97+4 \u224872-16.97 is 55.03, plus 4 gives 59.03.\n\nSo when n is 36, x is exactly 28, and at n=72, x is approximately 59.03. Wait, so the possible values of x are from 28 up to about 59.03. But the options given are:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these.\n\nHmm, so the minimum x is 28 (exactly at n=36), and the maximum is approximately 59.03. So the actual interval is 28 \u2264x \u2264 ~59.03. So let's check the options.\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. Since the maximum is just under 59.03, which is less than 60, so the upper bound of D is okay. The lower bound is 28, but the question says \"n such that 36 \u2264 n \u226472\". Wait, when n=36, x is exactly 28, so the inequality would be x \u226528. The option D says 28 <x <60, which excludes 28. But since n can be exactly 36, which gives x=28, then x can be equal to 28. So the correct interval should include 28 as a possible value. But option D says \"28 <x\", so 28 is excluded. So the actual interval is [28, ~59.03], so the lower bound is 28, so the correct answer must include 28. The options given don't have an option where the lower bound is \u226428. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 54 is less than 59.03 so upper bound too low.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u219258 is less than 59.03, so upper bound also too low.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 upper bound is okay (64>59), but lower bound 25 is lower than 28. Since x can be exactly 28, which is above 25, but the interval would include numbers between 25 and 28, which x never reaches. So the actual x starts at 28, so C's lower bound is too low, but upper is okay.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 lower bound is strict, but x can be exactly 28. So the correct interval is 28 \u2264x <60, but the option D says 28<x <60. So 28 is excluded. So the actual minimum is included, so D is not exactly correct. \n\nE)None of these.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that the options D's lower bound is strict. Since when n=36, x=28, so x can be equal to 28. Therefore, the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x <60, but none of the options include that. So the answer would be E?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the problem statement again. The question says \"satisfies\". The options are ranges. For example, option D says \"28 < x <60\". Since x can be exactly 28 (when n is 36), then 28 is not in D's interval. So the correct answer would be E, since none of the options include 28 as a possible value. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait let me recheck the calculation for n=36. x =36 -2*sqrt(36) +4. sqrt(36)=6. So 36 -12 +4 is indeed 28. So yes, x can be 28, which is the lower end. So the options given do not include an interval that includes 28 as a possible value. The closest is D, which is 28 <x <60, but since x can be exactly 28, which is not in D's interval. \n\nLooking at the other options:\n\nOption C is 25 <x<64. The lower bound is 25, which is less than 28, so that's okay because 28 is greater than 25, but the upper bound is 64. Since the maximum x is ~59, which is less than 64. So the interval 25 to 64 would include all x between 28 and ~59, so technically, all x values are within that range. So option C says 25 <x <64. The question is whether x can actually reach up to 64? Well, no, but the upper limit is less than 64. So the upper bound is okay. The lower bound is 25, which is lower than the minimum x (28), so the entire interval of x (28 to ~59) is within 25 to 64. So C's interval includes all possible x. So then why isn't C correct?\n\nWait, the options are phrased as \"satisfies\". The question is, which of the options must be true. So if all x are between 25 and 64, then option C would be correct because all x are within that interval. But the question is phrased as \"satisfies\" \u2014 meaning which interval does x lie in. Since all x are between 28 and ~59, then the interval that must contain all possible x is 25 <x <64. Because 25 is lower than 28, so all x are above 25, and the upper is 59 <64. So option C is correct. Wait, but then why?\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C says 25 <x <64. The actual minimum is 28, which is greater than 25, so the lower bound holds. The upper is ~59, which is less than 64. So all x are indeed between 25 and 64. So option C is correct. But then why did I think of E before?\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the options again.\n\nWait the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 The upper limit is 54, but when n is 72, x is about 59.03, so that's higher than 54. So A is incorrect.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u219258 is still less than 59.03, so B is also incorrect.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 The upper limit is okay, and lower limit 25 is okay because the minimum x is 28. So all x values lie between 25 and 64. So this is correct. \n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 The lower bound excludes 28, but x can be exactly 28, so D is not correct.\n\nE)None of these \u2192 But C is correct, so E would be wrong.\n\nWait, so this is conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Hmm. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the maximum x? Let me recalculate x when n=72.\n\nx =72 -2*sqrt(72) +4. sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22486*1.4142 \u22488.48528. So 2*8.48528 \u224816.97056.\n\n72 -16.97056 =55.02944, then add 4 gives 59.02944. So approximately 59.03. So that's correct. So the upper bound is ~59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay (since it's up to 60). But the problem with D is the lower bound. The minimum x is exactly 28, which is not included in D's interval. So if the question is about the possible values of x, then x can be 28, so the correct interval must include 28. Since none of the options include 28 except C (since C's lower bound is 25 <x, so 28 is included in that). So the answer would be C?\n\nBut why? The options are about which interval x satisfies. So if the question is, \"x is between which of the following intervals\", then the correct answer is C, because all x are between 25 and 64. Even though the actual range is narrower, the options are ranges that must contain all possible x. So C is correct because 25 <x <64 includes all possible x.\n\nWait but let's check the options again. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nSo even though the minimal x is 28, the 25 <28 is still true. So yes, the entire interval of x (from 28 to ~59) is within the interval given in C. So C is a valid option. \n\nHmm, so then why did I think earlier that D could be close but excluded the lower bound? Because D requires x to be greater than 28, but x can equal 28, so D is invalid. So the correct answer is C?\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"36 \u2264n \u226472\". So n can be 36, leading to x=28, which is included in C (since 28 is greater than 25). So C's interval includes all possible x values. So the answer should be C?\n\nBut the options given are A-E. Let me check again:\n\nThe options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 no, because when n is 72, x is ~59 which is over 54.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 no, 59 is over 58.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 yes, all x are between 25 and 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 no, because x can be exactly 28, which is excluded, so the lower bound is not valid.\n\nE)None of these \u2192 if C is correct, then E is wrong.\n\nHmm, so according to this, the correct answer is C. But I initially thought E. Wait, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the expression?\n\nLet me go through the simplification again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me substitute t=\u221an. Then:\n\nNumerator: (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16\n\nDenominator: t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2\n\nThen, numerator factored as (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 - 2t +4). So x = (t\u00b2 -2t +4). Which is t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is sqrt(n), substituting back, that is n -2\u221an +4. Wait, because t squared is n, so t squared is n, so yes, the expression becomes n -2\u221an +4. \n\nWait, that's correct. So when n is 36, substituting gives 36 -12 +4 =28. When n is 72, 72 -2*sqrt(72)+4 \u224859.03. So the calculations are correct.\n\nThus, the minimum x is 28, maximum is ~59.03. So the possible x values are in [28, ~59.03]. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nC says 25 <x <64. Since 25 <28 and 64>59.03, all possible x are within this interval. So the answer must be C. \n\nWait, but then why was I confused earlier? Because I thought the lower bound of D is 28, which is not included. But since the question is which interval does x satisfy, and all x are within C's interval, even if the actual x's start at 28, the interval C is still correct because it's a superset. The question is asking which interval x satisfies, so if all possible x are within that interval, then that's the answer. So the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nSo yes, since x is between 28 and 59.03, all of those values are between 25 and 64. So C is correct. So why did I think earlier that D was possible? Because D's upper limit is 60, which is closer. But the lower limit is 28, which excludes the minimal x. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\". So the correct interval must contain all x. So C is the only one that does. Therefore, the answer is C?\n\nWait, but the options are given as:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nBut the minimal x is 28. So the minimal x is 28, which is greater than 25, so the inequality 25 <x holds. The maximum is ~59 <64, so the upper holds. So yes, all x satisfy 25 <x <64, so the correct answer is C.\n\nHmm, so my initial mistake was thinking that because the minimum is 28, which is not 25, but the question is which interval contains all possible x, so C is correct. So the answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 54 is too low.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u219258 is too low.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 yes.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 no, because x can be exactly 28.\n\nE)None \u2192 no.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. But wait, let me check the problem once more to see if I misread anything.\n\nThe problem states that 36 \u2264 n \u226472, so n can be 36. Then x is exactly 28, so x can be 28. The question says \"satisfies\". So the interval must include x=28. Option C's lower bound is 25, so 28 is within that interval. So yes, C is correct.\n\nHmm, but let me check if the problem says \"satisfies\" which interval, meaning which is true for all x in the given n range. So since all x are between 25 and 64, option C is correct. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. The problem might have a trick. Let me re-express the equation again.\n\nWait, the numerator was simplified to (t^2 - 2t +4). Wait, substituting back, that's (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4 \u2192 n - 2\u221an +4. So x = n -2\u221an +4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4. Let me consider that as a quadratic in \u221an.\n\nLet me think of x = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4. Let me set t = \u221an, so x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. That's a quadratic in t. Let me see its minimum and maximum over t between 6 and sqrt(72) (which is ~8.485). \n\nThe quadratic x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4. The derivative is 2t -2. Setting to zero, t=1. Since the interval of t is from 6 to ~8.485, which is far to the right of t=1. So the function is increasing on that interval. Therefore, the minimum occurs at t=6 (n=36) and maximum at t= sqrt(72) (n=72). Which is exactly what I computed before. So x ranges from 28 to ~59.03. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C.\n\nWait, but in the options given, option D's upper bound is 60, which is very close to the maximum. But since the actual maximum is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay. However, the lower bound of D is 28, which is not allowed because x can be exactly 28. Since the question uses strict inequalities, D's interval does not include 28, so it's incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but then why does the problem have option C as 25 <x <64? That seems like a broad interval, but since it's the only one that includes all possible x, it must be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the numerator and denominator again step by step to ensure that my simplification was correct.\n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nLet me compute for n=36:\n\n36\u00b2 +2*6*(36 +4)+16 = 1296 + 2*6*40 +16 = 1296 + 480 +16 = 1296+496= 1792?\n\nWait, but when I simplified x as n-2\u221an +4, for n=36 gives 36-12+4=28. But if I compute numerator/denominator directly:\n\nNumerator when n=36: 36\u00b2 +2*6*(36+4)+16 = 1296 + 2*6*40 +16 = 1296 + 480 +16 = 1296+496= 1792.\n\nDenominator: 36 +4*6 +4 = 36+24+4=64.\n\nThen x =1792/64 =28. Which matches. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test: n= 49 (since sqrt(49)=7).\n\nThen x =49 -2*7 +4 =49-14+4=39.\n\nCompute via original expression:\n\nNumerator:49\u00b2 +2*7*(49+4)+16 = 2401 +2*7*53 +16 =2401 + 742 +16 =2401+758= 3159?\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\n2*7*(53)= 14*53. 14*50=700, 14*3=42 \u2192 total 742. So 2401 +742=3143, plus 16 is 3159.\n\nDenominator:49 +4*7 +4 =49+28+4=81.\n\n3159 /81 = 3159 \u00f781: 81*39= 3159. So yes, 39. Which matches x=39. So the simplification works.\n\nTherefore, the simplification is correct. So the answer is C. \n\nHmm. So I think I was overcomplicating earlier, but after checking, it's clear that C is correct. Therefore the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nYes. So the minimal x is 28, which is greater than 25, and maximum is ~59.03, less than 64. So all x are within C's interval. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because when I first thought that the answer might be E, but after careful consideration, it's C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is looking for the tightest possible interval, but the options don't have that. But the question says \"satisfies\". So any interval that contains all possible x is correct. Since C is the only one that does, then C is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out which interval x falls into, given that n is between 36 and 72. The expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can simplify it first.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator and denominator can be factored? Let me look at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me write that out again. Oh, maybe that's a perfect square? Let me check. Like, if I have something squared, like (\u221an + a)^2. Let's see: expanding that would give n + 2a\u221an + a\u00b2. Comparing that to the numerator, which is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Wait, no, that doesn't fit. Wait, the first term in the numerator is n squared, so maybe my initial thought is wrong.\n\nWait a second, maybe there's a different way to see this. Let me write the numerator again:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16.\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me think of variables here. Let me let t = \u221an. Then n = t\u00b2. Maybe substituting that in would help. Let's try that substitution.\n\nSo substituting t = \u221an, then the numerator becomes:\n\n(t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nt^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16\n\n= t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t +16.\n\nHmm, not sure that helps yet. What about the denominator?\n\nDenominator is n +4\u221an +4. Substituting t gives:\n\nt\u00b2 + 4t +4. Oh! That's a perfect square: (t + 2)^2. Nice!\n\nSo denominator simplifies to (t + 2)^2. Let me see the numerator again.\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator can also be expressed as a square? Let's see. Let me think of the numerator with t substitution again:\n\nNumerator is t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, maybe not obvious. Alternatively, maybe there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in substituting. Let me check the numerator again. The original numerator was n\u00b2 + 2\u221an*(n+4) +16. Wait, so when substituting t = \u221an, that term is 2t*(n +4). But n is t\u00b2, so n+4 is t\u00b2 +4. So yes, the numerator is indeed t^4 +2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16. Let me expand that:\n\nt^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can factor the numerator. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe the numerator is (t^2 + a t + b)^2? Let me try expanding that:\n\n(t^2 + a t + b)^2 = t^4 + 2a t^3 + (a\u00b2 + 2b) t^2 + 2ab t + b\u00b2.\n\nComparing to numerator: t^4 +2t^3 +0 t^2 +8t +16. So coefficients:\n\n2a =2 \u2192 a=1.\n\nThen, a\u00b2 +2b must equal 0 (since there's no t\u00b2 term). Since a=1, 1 +2b =0 \u2192 2b = -1 \u2192 b= -0.5. But then 2ab t term would be 2*(1)*(-0.5) t = -t, but in our numerator it's +8t, so that doesn't work. Hmm. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (t^2 + something)(something else). Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps there's another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original expression can be simplified as (something squared) over (something squared). Let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in substituting variables. Let me try another approach.\n\nWait the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16. Let me see: perhaps that's equal to (n + 2\u221a(n +4))\u00b2? Wait, let me check.\n\nLet me expand (n + 2\u221a(n +4))\u00b2: that would be n\u00b2 +4n\u221a(n+4) +4(n+4). Which is n\u00b2 +4n\u221a(n+4)+4n+16. Not the same as the numerator. Hmm, not quite.\n\nAlternatively, maybe ( \u221an(n) + something ) squared? Wait, perhaps the numerator can be written as ( \u221an^2 + 2\u221an * sqrt(n+4) + (sqrt(n+4))^2 )? Wait, but that would be (sqrt(n\u00b2) + sqrt(n+4))^2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator can be thought of as (n + 2\u221a(n) * something + ...). Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write the entire expression as a fraction and see if it simplifies.\n\nThe denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Let me factor that as (\u221an + 2)^2, which I had earlier. The numerator: maybe I can write it as (something squared). Let me see.\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me see if that can be expressed as (n + something)^2. Let me try:\n\nSuppose it's (n + a\u221an + b)^2. Let me expand that:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2a n^{3/2} + 2b n + a\u00b2 n + 2ab\u221an + b\u00b2. Hmm, comparing to numerator's terms:\n\nThe numerator has n\u00b2, terms with \u221an*(n+4), and 16. Hmm, this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different substitution. Let me think of the entire expression x = numerator/denominator. Let me see if I can factor numerator and denominator.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator can be written as (n + 2\u221a(n +4))^2? Wait, let me compute that:\n\n(n + 2\u221a(n+4))\u00b2 = n\u00b2 +4n\u221a(n+4) +4(n+4) = n\u00b2 +4n\u221a(n+4)+4n+16. Hmm, which is different from the numerator given here. The original numerator has 2\u221an(n+4) instead of 4n\u221a(n+4). So that's not the same.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to try plugging in numbers. Since n is between 36 and 72, let me pick n=36 and n=72 and see what x is. Then check which interval it falls into. Maybe that can help.\n\nWait, but since the options are ranges, maybe the expression simplifies to a linear function of n, so the minimum and maximum can be found by evaluating at endpoints. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expression simplifies to (\u221an + something)^2 over (\u221an + 2)^2. Let me try that.\n\nLet me go back to the substitution t = \u221an. Then, the denominator is (t +2)^2. The numerator is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm. Wait, maybe numerator can be expressed as (t^2 + t + 4)^2? Let me check:\n\n(t^2 + t +4)^2 = t^4 + 2t^3 + (1 + 8)t\u00b2 + 8t +16. Wait, that gives a t\u00b2 term which isn't present in the numerator. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (t^2 + a)^2 + ...? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps numerator is (t^3 + something)(something else). Hmm, this might not be the right path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can factor numerator as t^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. Let me see if there are any roots. Let me plug t = -2. Then:\n\n(-2)^4 + 2*(-2)^3 +8*(-2)+16 = 16 -16 -16 +16 = 0. Oh! So t = -2 is a root. Therefore, (t +2) is a factor.\n\nSo let's perform polynomial division. Divide numerator by (t +2).\n\nNumerator: t^4 +2t^3 +0t^2 +8t +16.\n\nDivide by t +2:\n\nUsing synthetic division for t = -2:\n\nCoefficients: 1 (t^4), 2 (t^3), 0 (t^2), 8 (t), 16 (constant).\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply by -2: 1*(-2) = -2. Add to next coefficient: 2 + (-2) =0.\n\nMultiply by -2: 0*(-2)=0. Add to next coefficient (0) \u2192 0.\n\nMultiply by -2 \u21920. Add to next coefficient 8 \u21928.\n\nMultiply by -2 \u2192 -16. Add to 16 \u21920. So the remainder is zero, so the division works.\n\nTherefore, the numerator factors into (t+2)(t^3 +0t^2 +0t +8) \u2192 (t+2)(t^3 +8). Now, t^3 +8 can be factored as (t +2)(t^2 - 2t +4). So overall, numerator is (t+2)^2 (t^2 - 2t +4).\n\nSo numerator is (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 -2t +4). The denominator is (t+2)^2. Therefore, x = numerator/denominator = (t\u00b2 -2t +4).\n\nOh! So that simplifies things a lot! So x = t\u00b2 -2t +4, where t = \u221an. Since t is \u221an and n is between 36 and72, then t is between \u221a36=6 and \u221a72\u22488.485 (since 8.485 squared is 72). Wait, \u221a72 is exactly 6*sqrt(2) which is about 8.485.\n\nSo substituting back, x = ( (\u221an)^2 ) -2\u221an +4 \u2192 n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, no. Wait, t is \u221an, so t squared is n. So x = (t squared) -2t +4 \u2192 which is n - 2\u221an +4. Wait, that's right. So x simplifies to n -2\u221an +4. That's a much simpler expression!\n\nWow, so that simplifies everything. So instead of dealing with the original complex fraction, we can just work with x = n -2\u221an +4. Now, since 36 \u2264n \u226472, let's compute x for the endpoints and maybe the middle to see the range.\n\nFirst, let's compute when n=36:\n\nx =36 -2*6 +4 =36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nWhen n=72:\n\nx=72 -2*sqrt(72)+4. Let me compute sqrt(72). sqrt(72)=6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. So 2*8.485\u224816.97. So 72-16.97+4 \u224872-16.97 is 55.03, plus 4 gives 59.03.\n\nSo when n is 36, x is exactly 28, and at n=72, x is approximately 59.03. Wait, so the possible values of x are from 28 up to about 59.03. But the options given are:\n\nA)20 <x<54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x<64\n\nD)28 <x<60\n\nE)None of these.\n\nHmm, so the minimum x is 28 (exactly at n=36), and the maximum is approximately 59.03. So the actual interval is 28 \u2264x \u2264 ~59.03. So let's check the options.\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. Since the maximum is just under 59.03, which is less than 60, so the upper bound of D is okay. The lower bound is 28, but the question says \"n such that 36 \u2264 n \u226472\". Wait, when n=36, x is exactly 28, so the inequality would be x \u226528. The option D says 28 <x <60, which excludes 28. But since n can be exactly 36, which gives x=28, then x can be equal to 28. So the correct interval should include 28 as a possible value. But option D says \"28 <x\", so 28 is excluded. So the actual interval is [28, ~59.03], so the lower bound is 28, so the correct answer must include 28. The options given don't have an option where the lower bound is \u226428. Let me check the options again.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 54 is less than 59.03 so upper bound too low.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u219258 is less than 59.03, so upper bound also too low.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 upper bound is okay (64>59), but lower bound 25 is lower than 28. Since x can be exactly 28, which is above 25, but the interval would include numbers between 25 and 28, which x never reaches. So the actual x starts at 28, so C's lower bound is too low, but upper is okay.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 lower bound is strict, but x can be exactly 28. So the correct interval is 28 \u2264x <60, but the option D says 28<x <60. So 28 is excluded. So the actual minimum is included, so D is not exactly correct. \n\nE)None of these.\n\nHmm, so the problem is that the options D's lower bound is strict. Since when n=36, x=28, so x can be equal to 28. Therefore, the correct interval should be 28 \u2264x <60, but none of the options include that. So the answer would be E?\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the problem statement again. The question says \"satisfies\". The options are ranges. For example, option D says \"28 < x <60\". Since x can be exactly 28 (when n is 36), then 28 is not in D's interval. So the correct answer would be E, since none of the options include 28 as a possible value. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation?\n\nWait let me recheck the calculation for n=36. x =36 -2*sqrt(36) +4. sqrt(36)=6. So 36 -12 +4 is indeed 28. So yes, x can be 28, which is the lower end. So the options given do not include an interval that includes 28 as a possible value. The closest is D, which is 28 <x <60, but since x can be exactly 28, which is not in D's interval. \n\nLooking at the other options:\n\nOption C is 25 <x<64. The lower bound is 25, which is less than 28, so that's okay because 28 is greater than 25, but the upper bound is 64. Since the maximum x is ~59, which is less than 64. So the interval 25 to 64 would include all x between 28 and ~59, so technically, all x values are within that range. So option C says 25 <x <64. The question is whether x can actually reach up to 64? Well, no, but the upper limit is less than 64. So the upper bound is okay. The lower bound is 25, which is lower than the minimum x (28), so the entire interval of x (28 to ~59) is within 25 to 64. So C's interval includes all possible x. So then why isn't C correct?\n\nWait, the options are phrased as \"satisfies\". The question is, which of the options must be true. So if all x are between 25 and 64, then option C would be correct because all x are within that interval. But the question is phrased as \"satisfies\" \u2014 meaning which interval does x lie in. Since all x are between 28 and ~59, then the interval that must contain all possible x is 25 <x <64. Because 25 is lower than 28, so all x are above 25, and the upper is 59 <64. So option C is correct. Wait, but then why?\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. Option C says 25 <x <64. The actual minimum is 28, which is greater than 25, so the lower bound holds. The upper is ~59, which is less than 64. So all x are indeed between 25 and 64. So option C is correct. But then why did I think of E before?\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me re-examine the options again.\n\nWait the options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 The upper limit is 54, but when n is 72, x is about 59.03, so that's higher than 54. So A is incorrect.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u219258 is still less than 59.03, so B is also incorrect.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 The upper limit is okay, and lower limit 25 is okay because the minimum x is 28. So all x values lie between 25 and 64. So this is correct. \n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 The lower bound excludes 28, but x can be exactly 28, so D is not correct.\n\nE)None of these \u2192 But C is correct, so E would be wrong.\n\nWait, so this is conflicting with my earlier conclusion. Hmm. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated the maximum x? Let me recalculate x when n=72.\n\nx =72 -2*sqrt(72) +4. sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22486*1.4142 \u22488.48528. So 2*8.48528 \u224816.97056.\n\n72 -16.97056 =55.02944, then add 4 gives 59.02944. So approximately 59.03. So that's correct. So the upper bound is ~59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay (since it's up to 60). But the problem with D is the lower bound. The minimum x is exactly 28, which is not included in D's interval. So if the question is about the possible values of x, then x can be 28, so the correct interval must include 28. Since none of the options include 28 except C (since C's lower bound is 25 <x, so 28 is included in that). So the answer would be C?\n\nBut why? The options are about which interval x satisfies. So if the question is, \"x is between which of the following intervals\", then the correct answer is C, because all x are between 25 and 64. Even though the actual range is narrower, the options are ranges that must contain all possible x. So C is correct because 25 <x <64 includes all possible x.\n\nWait but let's check the options again. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nSo even though the minimal x is 28, the 25 <28 is still true. So yes, the entire interval of x (from 28 to ~59) is within the interval given in C. So C is a valid option. \n\nHmm, so then why did I think earlier that D could be close but excluded the lower bound? Because D requires x to be greater than 28, but x can equal 28, so D is invalid. So the correct answer is C?\n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"36 \u2264n \u226472\". So n can be 36, leading to x=28, which is included in C (since 28 is greater than 25). So C's interval includes all possible x values. So the answer should be C?\n\nBut the options given are A-E. Let me check again:\n\nThe options:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 no, because when n is 72, x is ~59 which is over 54.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 no, 59 is over 58.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 yes, all x are between 25 and 64.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 no, because x can be exactly 28, which is excluded, so the lower bound is not valid.\n\nE)None of these \u2192 if C is correct, then E is wrong.\n\nHmm, so according to this, the correct answer is C. But I initially thought E. Wait, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in simplifying the expression?\n\nLet me go through the simplification again.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me substitute t=\u221an. Then:\n\nNumerator: (t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16\n\nDenominator: t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2\n\nThen, numerator factored as (t+2)^2 (t\u00b2 - 2t +4). So x = (t\u00b2 -2t +4). Which is t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is sqrt(n), substituting back, that is n -2\u221an +4. Wait, because t squared is n, so t squared is n, so yes, the expression becomes n -2\u221an +4. \n\nWait, that's correct. So when n is 36, substituting gives 36 -12 +4 =28. When n is 72, 72 -2*sqrt(72)+4 \u224859.03. So the calculations are correct.\n\nThus, the minimum x is 28, maximum is ~59.03. So the possible x values are in [28, ~59.03]. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nC says 25 <x <64. Since 25 <28 and 64>59.03, all possible x are within this interval. So the answer must be C. \n\nWait, but then why was I confused earlier? Because I thought the lower bound of D is 28, which is not included. But since the question is which interval does x satisfy, and all x are within C's interval, even if the actual x's start at 28, the interval C is still correct because it's a superset. The question is asking which interval x satisfies, so if all possible x are within that interval, then that's the answer. So the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nSo yes, since x is between 28 and 59.03, all of those values are between 25 and 64. So C is correct. So why did I think earlier that D was possible? Because D's upper limit is 60, which is closer. But the lower limit is 28, which excludes the minimal x. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"satisfies\". So the correct interval must contain all x. So C is the only one that does. Therefore, the answer is C?\n\nWait, but the options are given as:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nBut the minimal x is 28. So the minimal x is 28, which is greater than 25, so the inequality 25 <x holds. The maximum is ~59 <64, so the upper holds. So yes, all x satisfy 25 <x <64, so the correct answer is C.\n\nHmm, so my initial mistake was thinking that because the minimum is 28, which is not 25, but the question is which interval contains all possible x, so C is correct. So the answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 54 is too low.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u219258 is too low.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 yes.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 no, because x can be exactly 28.\n\nE)None \u2192 no.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be C. But wait, let me check the problem once more to see if I misread anything.\n\nThe problem states that 36 \u2264 n \u226472, so n can be 36. Then x is exactly 28, so x can be 28. The question says \"satisfies\". So the interval must include x=28. Option C's lower bound is 25, so 28 is within that interval. So yes, C is correct.\n\nHmm, but let me check if the problem says \"satisfies\" which interval, meaning which is true for all x in the given n range. So since all x are between 25 and 64, option C is correct. Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nWait, but wait a moment. The problem might have a trick. Let me re-express the equation again.\n\nWait, the numerator was simplified to (t^2 - 2t +4). Wait, substituting back, that's (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4 \u2192 n - 2\u221an +4. So x = n -2\u221an +4. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can write this as (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4. Let me consider that as a quadratic in \u221an.\n\nLet me think of x = (\u221an)^2 - 2\u221an +4. Let me set t = \u221an, so x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. That's a quadratic in t. Let me see its minimum and maximum over t between 6 and sqrt(72) (which is ~8.485). \n\nThe quadratic x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4. The derivative is 2t -2. Setting to zero, t=1. Since the interval of t is from 6 to ~8.485, which is far to the right of t=1. So the function is increasing on that interval. Therefore, the minimum occurs at t=6 (n=36) and maximum at t= sqrt(72) (n=72). Which is exactly what I computed before. So x ranges from 28 to ~59.03. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C.\n\nWait, but in the options given, option D's upper bound is 60, which is very close to the maximum. But since the actual maximum is about 59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay. However, the lower bound of D is 28, which is not allowed because x can be exactly 28. Since the question uses strict inequalities, D's interval does not include 28, so it's incorrect. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but then why does the problem have option C as 25 <x <64? That seems like a broad interval, but since it's the only one that includes all possible x, it must be correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the numerator and denominator again step by step to ensure that my simplification was correct.\n\nOriginal numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16.\n\nLet me compute for n=36:\n\n36\u00b2 +2*6*(36 +4)+16 = 1296 + 2*6*40 +16 = 1296 + 480 +16 = 1296+496= 1792?\n\nWait, but when I simplified x as n-2\u221an +4, for n=36 gives 36-12+4=28. But if I compute numerator/denominator directly:\n\nNumerator when n=36: 36\u00b2 +2*6*(36+4)+16 = 1296 + 2*6*40 +16 = 1296 + 480 +16 = 1296+496= 1792.\n\nDenominator: 36 +4*6 +4 = 36+24+4=64.\n\nThen x =1792/64 =28. Which matches. So that's correct.\n\nAnother test: n= 49 (since sqrt(49)=7).\n\nThen x =49 -2*7 +4 =49-14+4=39.\n\nCompute via original expression:\n\nNumerator:49\u00b2 +2*7*(49+4)+16 = 2401 +2*7*53 +16 =2401 + 742 +16 =2401+758= 3159?\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\n2*7*(53)= 14*53. 14*50=700, 14*3=42 \u2192 total 742. So 2401 +742=3143, plus 16 is 3159.\n\nDenominator:49 +4*7 +4 =49+28+4=81.\n\n3159 /81 = 3159 \u00f781: 81*39= 3159. So yes, 39. Which matches x=39. So the simplification works.\n\nTherefore, the simplification is correct. So the answer is C. \n\nHmm. So I think I was overcomplicating earlier, but after checking, it's clear that C is correct. Therefore the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nYes. So the minimal x is 28, which is greater than 25, and maximum is ~59.03, less than 64. So all x are within C's interval. Therefore, the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but I'm confused because when I first thought that the answer might be E, but after careful consideration, it's C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is looking for the tightest possible interval, but the options don't have that. But the question says \"satisfies\". So any interval that contains all possible x is correct. Since C is the only one that does, then C is correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C.\n\n\nThe given expression for \\( x \\) is simplified by substituting \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\). This transforms the numerator and denominator into:\n\n- **Numerator**: \\( t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16 \\), which factors as \\( (t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4) \\).\n- **Denominator**: \\( (t + 2)^2 \\).\n\nDividing these gives \\( x = t^2 - 2t + 4 \\). Substituting back \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), we get \\( x = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\).\n\nFor \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\):\n- When \\( n = 36 \\), \\( x = 36 - 2 \\times 6 + 4 = 28 \\).\n- When \\( n = 72 \\), \\( x \\approx 72 - 2 \\times 8.485 + 4 \\approx 59.03 \\).\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from \\( 28 \\) to approximately \\( 59.03 \\). The interval must include all values of \\( x \\). The only option that fully contains this range is **C) 25 < \\( x \\) < 64**, as \\( 25 < 28 \\) and \\( 59.03 < 64 \\). While other options exclude parts of the range or are too narrow, option C satisfies the entire interval.\n\nAnswer: C",
