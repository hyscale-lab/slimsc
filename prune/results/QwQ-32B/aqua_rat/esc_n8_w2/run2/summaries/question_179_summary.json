      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is asking for the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around a rectangular plot. The perimeter of the plot is given as 340 meters, and the rate is 10 per square meter. Hmm, so I need to find the area of that boundary and then multiply by 10 to get the cost.\n\nWait, first, the plot is rectangular. The perimeter is 340 meters. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2*(length + width). But since it's a rectangle, I don't know the individual lengths of the sides, just their sum. Because 2*(l + w) = 340, so l + w = 170. But I don't know l and w individually. That might be a problem because if I need the area of the boundary, which is like a path around the rectangle, maybe I need the original area?\n\nWait, the boundary is 1 meter broad. So the area to be gardened would be the area of the larger rectangle (the original plus the boundary) minus the area of the original plot. But since the boundary is 1m wide around, the larger rectangle would have length increased by 2 meters (1m on each side) and width also increased by 2 meters. So the area of the boundary is ( (L+2)*(W+2) ) - (L*W). Let me compute that.\n\nExpanding (L+2)(W+2) gives L*W + 2L + 2W +4. Subtracting L*W leaves 2L + 2W +4. So that's the area of the boundary. Then, 2(L + W) +4. But since the perimeter is 2(L + W) =340, so 2(L+W) is 340. So substituting, the area becomes 340 +4 = 344. Then multiply by 10, so 344*10 = 3440. So the answer would be C)3440?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Let me go through again.\n\nThe area of the path (the boundary) is the area of the outer rectangle minus the inner one. The outer rectangle's dimensions are (L+2) by (W+2), right? Because the path is 1m all around. So yes, adding 1m to each side, so total addition of 2m to each dimension. So the area difference is indeed (L+2)(W+2) - L*W = 2L +2W +4. \n\nBut since the perimeter is 2(L+W) = 340, then L + W = 170. Therefore, 2(L+W) is 340. So the 2L +2W part is 340. So adding the 4 gives 344. So the area is 344 square meters. Multiply by 10, cost is 3440. That's option C. \n\nHmm, but wait another thought. Is the path only around the plot, so maybe the calculation is correct. Alternatively, could there be another way to interpret the problem? Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is trying to trick me. Suppose the path is 1 meter broad, so maybe the area is perimeter multiplied by the width of the path minus the corners? Wait, no, because when you have a path around a rectangle, the area can be calculated as perimeter * width + (width)^2. Wait, maybe that's another way to think. Let me see:\n\nThe area of the path is (perimeter * width) + (width squared *4 corners? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think. Let's see, when you have a path around a rectangle, the area is indeed ( (L + 2w)(W + 2w) - L*W ), where w is the width of the path (1m here). So substituting w=1, that gives (L+2)(W+2) - L*W = 2L +2W +4, which is exactly what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nSo since the perimeter is 2(L+W)=340, so L+W =170, then 2(L+W)=340. So substituting into the area expression gives 340 +4=344. So the area is 344, so cost is 344*10=3440. So the answer should be C. But let me check the options. The options are A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D) cannot be determined, E) none.\n\nHmm, so C is an option. Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure that there isn't a mistake here. For example, if the path is only 1 meter broad, but when you add 1 meter on each side, the length becomes L +2, and similarly for width. So the calculation seems right. \n\nAlternatively, could the question have meant that the boundary is 1 meter in some other way? Like maybe the width is 1 meter but only on one side? No, the question says 1-metre broad boundary around, which would mean 1m on each side. \n\nSo the calculation seems correct, so the answer is C)3440. Therefore the correct option is C.\n",

The perimeter of the plot is given as 340 meters, and the rate is 10 per square meter. Hmm, let's see. \n\nFirst, the question is about finding the area of the boundary, right? Because the cost depends on the area. The boundary is 1 meter wide all around the rectangle. Wait, how do I calculate that area?\n\nLet me think. Let's denote the length and width of the rectangular plot as L and W. The perimeter is 2(L + W) = 340, so L + W = 170 meters. That's given. \n\nNow, the boundary is a 1m wide path around the rectangle. So the area of this path would be the area of the larger rectangle (including the path) minus the area of the original plot. \n\nThe original area is L * W. The larger rectangle would have a length of L + 2 (since 1m on each side) and width W + 2. So the area of the larger rectangle is (L+2)*(W+2). \n\nTherefore, the area of the path is (L+2)(W+2) - L*W. Let me expand that:\n\n(L+2)(W+2) = L*W + 2L + 2W +4. Subtract L*W, so the path's area is 2L + 2W +4. \n\nWait a second, simplifying that gives 2(L + W) +4. Since we know L + W is 170, substituting in, that's 2*170 +4 = 340 +4 = 344 square meters. \n\nThen, the cost would be 344 * 10 = 3440. So looking at the options, C is 3440. But wait, hold on. Let me check again because sometimes I might make a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the path's area another way. The path is 1m wide around, so another way to think is that the area is perimeter multiplied by the width of the path minus the corners. Wait, perimeter times width would be 340*1, but that would be 340, but then the corners are squares of 1x1, four of them, so adding 4. So total area would be 340 +4 = 344. Oh, that's the same as before. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the area is 344, multiplied by 10 gives 3440. So the answer should be C)3440. But let me check the options again. The options are A)3400, B)1700, C)3440, D)Cannot be determined, E)None of these. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Is there an assumption here that the path is only on the outside? But the problem says \"boundary around\", which I assume is the outer edge. So the calculation seems correct. But maybe there's a catch here. \n\nWait, the problem states that it's a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340. But to compute the area of the path, we need to know the dimensions (L and W) but here we only have the sum L+W = 170. But in my calculation above, when I computed the path's area as 2(L + W) +4, that's actually independent of L and W individually. Because 2(L+W) is the perimeter, so that's 340. Then adding 4 gives 344. So regardless of what L and W are, as long as their sum is 170, the area of the path will be the same. \n\nTherefore, the area can be determined without knowing the exact length and width. So the answer is 3440, which is option C. \n\nHmm, but wait another thought: the formula for the area of the path when it's around a rectangle is indeed (perimeter \u00d7 width) + (width squared) \u00d74 corners? Wait no. Wait, let me think again. \n\nThe standard formula for a path around a rectangle: suppose the path is of width x around the rectangle. The area is 2*(L + W)*x + 4x\u00b2. Because when you expand the rectangle by x on each side, the extra area is like adding the sides (each side's length times x, times two for opposite sides) plus the four corners which are x by x. \n\nIn this case, x is 1. So the formula would be 2*(L + W)*1 + 4*(1)^2. Which is exactly 2*(L+W) +4. Since L+W is 170, that gives 2*170 +4 = 344. So that's correct. \n\nSo the answer is 3440, so option C. Therefore, the correct answer is C. But wait, let me check again the options. The options have C as 3440, which matches. So the answer must be C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe someone might think that the path is only on the inside, but the question says \"boundary around\", which is the outside.
