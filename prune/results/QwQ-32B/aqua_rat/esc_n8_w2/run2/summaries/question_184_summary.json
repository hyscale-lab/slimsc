      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem where a number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. Hmm, let me think. The question is saying that the difference between the number and 36 is the same as the difference between 86 and the number. Oh right, because if it's greater than 36 by a certain amount and less than 86 by the same amount, those two differences must be equal.\n\nLet me set up an equation. Let the number be x. Then the amount it's greater than 36 is (x - 36). The amount it's less than 86 would be (86 - x). Since these are equal, I can write:\n\nx - 36 = 86 - x\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let's bring all the x terms to one side and constants to the other. Adding x to both sides:\n\nx -36 + x = 86\n\nWhich simplifies to 2x -36 =86. Then add 36 to both sides:\n\n2x = 86 +36 = 122\n\nSo x = 122 /2 = 61. Wait, so the number is 61? Let me check the options. Option D is 61. \n\nWait, let me verify again. Let's plug back in. 61 -36 is 25, and 86-61 is also 25. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be D)61. But let me look at the options again to make sure. The options are A)60, B)56, C)51, D)61, E)41. Yes, D is there. So the correct answer must be D.\n",
