      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about averages and percentages. Let me see how to tackle it. The question says that the passing students had an average of 83, the failing ones 55, and the overall class average is 76. They want to know what percent passed. Hmm, right. \n\nAlright, let's think. This sounds like a weighted average problem. The overall average is a mix of the two groups: pass and fail. So maybe I can set up an equation where the total points from both groups equals the overall average multiplied by the total number of students.\n\nLet me denote the number of passing students as P and failing as F. The total students would be P + F. The total points for passers would be 83P, and for failers 55F. The overall average is 76, so total points is 76*(P + F). \n\nSo setting up the equation: 83P + 55F = 76(P + F). \n\nHmm, I need to solve for the ratio of P to the total. Let me rearrange this equation. \n\nFirst, expand the right side: 76P + 76F. \n\nSubtract that from both sides to get: 83P +55F -76P -76F =0. \n\nSimplify the left side terms: (83P-76P)=7P, and (55F -76F)= -21F. So the equation is 7P -21F =0. \n\nWhich can be written as 7P =21F \u2192 P=3F. So P is three times F. \n\nSo the total number of students is P + F = 3F + F =4F. \n\nTherefore, the percentage of passers is (P/(P+F)) *100 = (3F/4F)*100 = 75%. Wait, but 75% is option E. But let me check the options again. The options are A)44%, B)66%, C)68%, D)72%, E)75%. \n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check my math. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me go through again. \n\nOriginal equation: 83P +55F =76(P +F). \n\nExpanding gives 83P +55F =76P +76F. \n\nSubtract 76P and 55F from both sides: 7P = 21F \u2192 P=3F. \n\nHmm, that's correct. So then the ratio P/(P+F) = 3/(3+1) = 3/4, which is 75%, so E. But wait, maybe I have the ratio reversed? Because if P is three times F, then F is one part and P is three parts. So total four parts, so P is 75%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the difference from the overall average. Like, the passers are 83-76=7 above, and the failers are 76-55=21 below. The ratio of the distances would be inversely proportional to the ratio of the groups. \n\nOh right! That's another way to think about it. The concept is that the distances from the overall average determine the ratio. The passers are 7 points above, and the failers are 21 below. So the ratio of passers to failers is 21:7, which simplifies to 3:1. So again, that gives the same result. So 3 parts pass to 1 part fail, so 75% passed. \n\nHmm, so that's consistent. So the answer should be E)75%. But wait, the options given include E as 75. So why is the question here? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me check the problem again. \n\nWait, the problem says \"what percent of the class passed?\" So if 3 parts out of 4 passed, that's 75%, so E is correct. But let me see the options again. The options are A)44, B)66, C)68, D)72, E)75. So yes, E is there. \n\nHmm, maybe I was overcomplicating, but I think the answer is E. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me think again. Suppose the passing average is 83, failing is 55, overall 76. \n\nAlternatively, let me use variables where total students = N. Let the number of passers be p and failers be f. So p + f = N. \n\nThe total score is 83p +55f =76N. \n\nWe can write 83p +55(N-p) =76N. \n\nWait, substituting f = N-p. \n\nSo expanding that: 83p +55N -55p =76N \u2192 (83-55)p =76N -55N \u2192 28p =21N \u2192 p = (21/28)N \u2192 simplifies to 3/4 N. So that's 75% again. \n\nSo that's the same result. So the answer is E. But why is option B 66%? That's like two-thirds. Maybe a common mistake if someone miscalculates the ratio. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the difference approach. Let me try that again. The idea is that the ratio of the groups is inversely proportional to the distances. So the distance of passers above the mean is 83-76=7. The distance of failers below is 76-55=21. \n\nSo the ratio of passers to failers is 21:7 = 3:1. So passers are 3 parts, failers 1, so total 4 parts. So passers are 3/4, 75%. \n\nYes, so that's the same as before. So I think the correct answer is E. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the sign somewhere? Let me see. Suppose I set up the equation as (83 * p +55 *f)/(p + f) =76. \n\nMultiply both sides by (p +f): 83p +55f =76p +76f \u2192 83p -76p =76f -55f \u21927p =21f \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo yeah, seems correct. So the answer must be E)75%. So I think that's it. The options given include E, so that's the one.\n",

Let me denote the percentage of students who passed as P, and those who failed as F. But since it's a percentage of the class, P + F should equal 100%, right? Or maybe it's better to use fractions. Like, let's let the total number of students be 100 for simplicity. Then, if P is the percentage that passed, there are P students who passed and (100 - P) who failed. \n\nThe total points for the passing students would be 83 * P, and the failing students contribute 55*(100 - P).

Combine like terms: (83P -55P) +5500 =7600 \u2192 28P +5500 =7600. \n\nSubtract 5500 from both sides: 28P = 2100. Then P = 2100 /28.
