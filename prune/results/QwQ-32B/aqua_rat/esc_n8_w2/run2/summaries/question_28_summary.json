      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of these pairs (x,y) doesn't satisfy the condition where the second number is less than or equal to the square root of the first. Let's see. The problem says the first number is between 0 and 100 inclusive, and the second number (y) has to be \u2264 sqrt(x). \n\nLet me go through each option one by one. \n\nStarting with option A: (99,10). The square root of 99 is... Hmm, sqrt(100) is 10, so sqrt(99) must be just a bit less than 10. Like around 9.949 or something. So 10 is greater than that. Wait, that would mean that 10 is not \u2264 sqrt(99), so this pair would be invalid. But let me check all options before deciding.\n\nOption B is (85,9). The square root of 85 is sqrt(81)=9, so sqrt(85) is a bit more than 9. Since 9 is less than that, then 9 \u2264 sqrt(85) would be true. So B is okay.\n\nOption C: (50,7). sqrt(50) is approximately 7.07. So 7 is less than that. So 7 is okay. So C is valid.\n\nD is (1,1). The square root of 1 is 1, so 1 is equal to sqrt(1). So that's allowed. So D is okay.\n\nE is (1,0). 0 is definitely less than sqrt(1)=1. So that's valid too.\n\nSo the only one that doesn't work is A, because 10 is greater than sqrt(99). Wait, but I thought sqrt(99) is like 9.949, so 10 is larger. Therefore, the pair (99,10) violates the condition. So the answer must be A.\n",

Since 10 is greater than the square root of 99, that would mean this pair doesn't satisfy the condition. Hmm, but wait, the problem says \"less than or equal to the square root of the first\".
