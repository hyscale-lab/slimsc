      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about finding the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom or the debating session. The school has 200 students total. \n\nThe problem states that at least 45% attended the prom and at least 35% participated in the debating. Wait, \"at least\" here probably means that the minimum number of attendees for each event is given. So, to find the maximum number of students who didn't go to either, I need to minimize the number of students who went to at least one of the events. Because the more students that went to either event, the fewer are left who didn't go. \n\nRight, so to maximize the number of students who didn't attend either, we need to minimize the total number who attended at least one of the events. The way to do that is by maximizing the overlap between the two groups. Because if more students went to both events, then the total attending either would be smaller. \n\nLet me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for the union of two sets is A + B - (A \u2229 B). To minimize the total attending either, we want to maximize the overlap (A \u2229 B). \n\nSo first, let's compute the minimum number of students that must have attended each event. \n\n45% of 200 students is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students for the prom. At least 90 attended. Similarly, 35% of 200 is 0.35*200=70 students for the debate. \n\nSo the minimum number for prom is 90, debate is 70. \n\nThe maximum possible overlap between these two groups would be the smaller of the two numbers. Wait, because the overlap can't be more than the size of either set. Since 70 is smaller, the maximum overlap is 70. \n\nWait, but actually, the overlap can't exceed the size of either group. So if all 70 debate participants also went to the prom, then the overlap is 70. \n\nIn that case, the total number attending at least one event would be 90 (prom) +70 (debate) -70 (overlap) = 90. \n\nWait, that's 90. But that's the same as the prom's minimum. Hmm, but maybe I need to check again. \n\nAlternatively, the total attending either would be A + B - both. To minimize the total, maximize both. The maximum possible both can be is the minimum of A and B. Since A here is 90, B is 70, so maximum overlap is 70. \n\nSo total in either is 90 +70 -70 = 90. \n\nTherefore, the minimal number of students attending either event is 90. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number who didn't attend either would be total students minus that. \n\n200 - 90 = 110. Wait, but that's option E. But the options include 110 as E, but the problem says \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% debate\". Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake here because the problem states \"at least\" so the actual numbers could be higher. \n\nWait, the question is asking for the maximum possible number of students who didn't attend either. To get that maximum, we need the number of students who went to at least one event to be as small as possible. \n\nThe minimal possible number of students attending prom is 90 (since 45% of 200), and debate is 70 (35%). \n\nSo the minimal total for both would be when the overlap is as large as possible. \n\nSo overlapping as much as possible, which is 70 (since debate has only 70). So total is 90 +70 -70 =90. So the minimal total attendees are 90. \n\nSo the maximum number not attending either is 200-90=110. So that would be option E. But wait, the options have E as 110, but the answer might not be that? Because maybe I'm missing something here. Let me check again. \n\nWait the problem says \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% took part in debate\". So the actual numbers could be higher. But when trying to find the maximum number who didn't attend either, we need to consider the minimal possible attendees. \n\nSo the minimal possible total attendees would be when both the prom and debate have exactly the minimum required (90 and 70) and their overlap is maximum (70). So total is 90, so the remaining is 110. \n\nHmm, so that would be E. But the options have E as 110. Wait but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem is phrased as \"at least 45%\", so the number attending prom is at least 90, debate at least 70. To minimize the total attendees, we take the minimal numbers (90 and 70) and maximize their overlap. \n\nSo the maximum overlap is 70. Then the union is 90 +70 -70 =90. \n\nTherefore, 200-90=110. So that would be the maximum possible number of students who didn't attend either. \n\nSo the answer should be E. But why is there an option D as 99? Maybe I did something wrong here. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the percentages can't overlap more than possible. Wait, but the debate has 70 people. All of them could have gone to the prom. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the question says \"at least\" so the numbers can be higher, so perhaps there's a constraint that if you have more people in one, then the overlap can't be as big? \n\nWait, no. To minimize the total, we take the minimal possible numbers (90 and 70) and maximize their overlap. \n\nHmm, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the percentages. Let me recalculate: 45% of 200 is indeed 90. 35% is 70. \n\nHmm. So the maximum number of students who didn't attend either is 110. So the answer is E. \n\nBut let me look at the options again. The options are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me think of another way. Suppose that the problem requires that both the prom and debate have at least those percentages, but perhaps the maximum non-attendees would be when the overlap is as large as possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where you can't have the overlap that high. For example, if you have 90 in prom and 70 in debate, the maximum overlap is 70. So total in either is 90, so 110 not in either. \n\nSo that's correct, so E is the answer. But why is the option D there? Maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is worded as \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% the debate\", so the minimal attendees are those numbers, but maybe when calculating, the total can't be less than 90+70 - 200? Wait, no. \n\nWait, the maximum overlap is min(A,B) so that's correct. \n\nHmm, I think the answer is E, but let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the percentages are given as \"at least\", so maybe the numbers can be higher. But since we are to find the maximum number who didn't attend either, we need to minimize the total attendees. \n\nSo yes, that would require using the minimal possible numbers. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing a key point here. Let me think of an example. \n\nSuppose exactly 90 went to prom and exactly 70 to debate. All the debate attendees also went to the prom. Then total in either is 90. So 200-90=110. \n\nAlternatively, if only 70 of the prom attendees were also in debate, that's the maximum possible overlap. \n\nSo that scenario is possible, so the maximum number not attending either is 110. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be E. \n\nWait but let me check another angle. Maybe the question is a bit different. Like, \"at least 45% attended the prom\" means that the number could be higher. So perhaps the problem is that when you take the minimal numbers, you can get the maximum non-attendees, but maybe there's a constraint that the percentages can't be that? \n\nWait no, the question asks for the maximum possible number, so you choose the minimal attendees. \n\nHmm. I think I'm confident that the answer is E. So why is there an option D)99? Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an arithmetic mistake. Let me check again. \n\n45% of 200 is 90, 35% is 70. \n\nThe minimal possible total is 90 (if all debate attendees are in prom). \n\n200-90=110. \n\nSo yes, that's E. \n\nHmm. So I think that's correct. Maybe the options are correct and I just need to go with E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says \"at least 45% attended the prom and at least 35% the debate\", but maybe the \"and\" implies that both conditions must hold, so the minimal total is higher. \n\nWait no, that's exactly what I considered. \n\nHmm, I think the correct answer is E. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is a bit different. Let me re-read the question again. \n\n\"Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?\"\n\nYes, exactly as I thought. So to maximize the neither, minimize the either. \n\nYes, so answer E. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is E. So why is option C 90? 200 - (90+70 -70) is 110. \n\nSo the answer must be E. \n\nSo I think the correct answer is E)110.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom or the debating session. Let's see. The school has 200 students total. The problem says at least 45% attended the prom and at least 35% were in the debating session. Wait, right, when they say \"at least,\" that means the minimum number for each event. So to find the maximum number of students who didn't go to either, I think I need to minimize the number of students who went to either event. Because the more students that went to at least one of them, the fewer are left who didn't go to either. But since the question is asking for the maximum possible number who didn't attend either, I need the minimum possible overlap between the two events. \n\nHmm, let me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for the union of two sets is A + B - A\u2229B. To minimize the total number of students who went to either event, I want the overlap (A\u2229B) to be as large as possible. Wait, right, because if the overlap is bigger, then the total union becomes smaller. Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, inclusion-exclusion says that the union is A + B - their intersection. So if the intersection is larger, the union is smaller. So to minimize the number of students in either event, we need to maximize the overlap between the two groups. \n\nSo, the minimum number of students attending either event would be when the overlap between prom and debating is as large as possible. Therefore, the maximum number who didn't attend either would be 200 minus that minimum. \n\nLet me structure this step by step. \n\nFirst, the minimum number of students who went to the prom is 45% of 200. Let me calculate that: 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. Similarly, the minimum number who went to the debating session is 35% of 200, which is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students. \n\nSo, the smallest possible number attending prom is 90, and debating is 70. To find the minimum number of students who went to at least one event, we use the formula:\n\nMinimum (A \u222a B) = A + B - Maximum possible (A \u2229 B). \n\nBut wait, the maximum possible overlap between A and B can't exceed the size of either set. So the maximum possible overlap here would be the smaller of the two groups. Since prom has 90 and debating has 70, the maximum possible overlap is 70 (since all debating participants could also have gone to the prom). \n\nWait, yes. Because if all 70 debating participants also attended the prom, then the overlap is 70. So then the union would be 90 +70 -70 =90. So the minimum number of students who went to at least one event is 90. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number who didn't attend either would be 200 - 90 = 110? Wait, but 110 is one of the options (option E). But wait, hold on. Let me double-check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem states \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% took part in debating\". So the actual numbers could be higher. But since we are looking for the maximum number who didn't attend either, we need to take the minimum possible for each event. Because if the events have as few attendees as possible, then the remaining students can be as many as possible. \n\nSo the minimum number attending prom is 90, and debating is 70. The maximum overlap would be when all 70 debating attendees are part of the 90 prom attendees. Then the total number attending either is 90 (since all the debating ones are already in the prom group). So that leaves 200 -90 =110 students who didn't go to either. \n\nBut wait, the options have E as 110. But I need to check if that's possible. But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the numbers can't be lower than their minimums. Wait, but the problem says \"at least\" those percentages, so the actual numbers could be higher, but to find the maximum possible non-attendees, we take the minimal numbers. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a constraint that when you take the minimal numbers, the overlapping can't be more than the smaller of the two. Since the prom has at least 90, and debating at least 70, the maximum overlap is indeed 70. So the union is 90 +70 -70 =90. \n\nThus, the maximum possible number who didn't attend either is 110, so E. But wait, the options include E)110, so that would be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me see if another approach gives the same result. Let me think in terms of variables. Let P be the number of prom attendees (\u226590), D be debating (\u226570). The number who went to at least one is P + D - both. To minimize this, we need to maximize both. The maximum possible both is the minimum of P and D. Since P is at least 90 and D is at least 70, the maximum possible overlap is when D is 70 and all of them are in P. So the overlap is 70, so the total is 90+70-70=90. So yes, that gives 200-90=110. \n\nHmm, but the options include E)110, so that's the answer. But why does the question have other options? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the question again. \n\n\"at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session.\" So the minimums are 90 and 70. The question is the maximum number who could have neither. So the maximum number not in either is achieved when the overlap is as large as possible, so the union is as small as possible. So the calculation seems right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick where \"at least\" percentages mean that the numbers can't be lower than that, so the minimal possible union is 90+70 - 70 =90, leading to 110. So E is correct. \n\nBut wait, another thought: the problem says \"at least 45%\", so the prom could have exactly 45%, but the debating could have more. Wait, but to minimize the union, we want the debating to be as small as possible (since the minimum is 35%). So yes, 70 is the minimum for D, and 90 for P. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be E) 110. \n\nWait, but the options also include 99 (D), which is 200- (90+70 -0). That would be if there's no overlap, but that's the maximum possible union, leading to minimal non-attendees. So that's the opposite scenario. \n\nHmm, so the answer is E. But let me check again. Let me think of an example. Suppose exactly 90 went to prom, and exactly 70 to debating, and all 70 of the debaters also went to prom. Then total in either is 90. So 200-90=110. So that's possible. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible is 110. So the answer should be E. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes these problems can have a different approach. Let me check another angle. \n\nAlternatively, using the formula for maximum possible non-overlapping. The maximum number who didn't attend either is 200 - (minimum prom + minimum debating - maximum overlap). So yeah, same as before. \n\nAlternatively, the maximum number not in either is 200 - (A + B - overlap). To maximize this, we need to minimize (A+B - overlap). Which is done by making A and B as small as possible (since they are at least given values) and overlap as large as possible. \n\nTherefore, yes, the calculation is correct. The answer is E. \n\nWait, but why is there an option D)99? Let me see: 200 - (90+70) =40, but that's if there's no overlap. Wait, but that would be the minimal number of non-attendees. Wait, no. Wait, if there's no overlap, then the total attending either is 90+70=160. So non-attendees would be 40. So that's the minimum possible non-attendees. So that's not what we want. \n\nSo the maximum non-attendees is when the union is as small as possible. Which would be when the overlap is as big as possible. \n\nSo the calculation gives 110. So the answer must be E. \n\nHmm, so I think that's correct. So the answer is E.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debating session, we start by noting the minimum attendees for each event: at least 45% (90 students) for the prom and 35% (70 students) for the debating session. To minimize the total number of students attending at least one event, we maximize the overlap between the two groups. The maximum overlap occurs when all 70 debating participants also attended the prom. Thus, the union of attendees is \\(90 + 70 - 70 = 90\\).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum number of students who didn't attend either the prom or the debating session. Let's see. The school has 200 students total. The problem says at least 45% attended the prom and at least 35% were in the debating session. Wait, right, when they say \"at least,\" that means the minimum number for each event. So to find the maximum number of students who didn't go to either, I think I need to minimize the number of students who went to either event. Because the more students that went to at least one of them, the fewer are left who didn't go to either. But since the question is asking for the maximum possible number who didn't attend either, I need the minimum possible overlap between the two events. \n\nHmm, let me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula for the union of two sets is A + B - A\u2229B. To minimize the total number of students who went to either event, I want the overlap (A\u2229B) to be as large as possible. Wait, right, because if the overlap is bigger, then the total union becomes smaller. Wait, no, let me think again. Wait, inclusion-exclusion says that the union is A + B - their intersection. So if the intersection is larger, the union is smaller. So to minimize the number of students in either event, we need to maximize the overlap between the two groups. \n\nSo, the minimum number of students attending either event would be when the overlap between prom and debating is as large as possible. Therefore, the maximum number who didn't attend either would be 200 minus that minimum. \n\nLet me structure this step by step. \n\nFirst, the minimum number of students who went to the prom is 45% of 200. Let me calculate that: 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. Similarly, the minimum number who went to the debating session is 35% of 200, which is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students. \n\nSo, the smallest possible number attending prom is 90, and debating is 70. To find the minimum number of students who went to at least one event, we use the formula:\n\nMinimum (A \u222a B) = A + B - Maximum possible (A \u2229 B). \n\nBut wait, the maximum possible overlap between A and B can't exceed the size of either set. So the maximum possible overlap here would be the smaller of the two groups. Since prom has 90 and debating has 70, the maximum possible overlap is 70 (since all debating participants could also have gone to the prom). \n\nWait, yes. Because if all 70 debating participants also attended the prom, then the overlap is 70. So then the union would be 90 +70 -70 =90. So the minimum number of students who went to at least one event is 90. \n\nTherefore, the maximum number who didn't attend either would be 200 - 90 = 110? Wait, but 110 is one of the options (option E). But wait, hold on. Let me double-check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem states \"at least 45% attended the prom\" and \"at least 35% took part in debating\". So the actual numbers could be higher. But since we are looking for the maximum number who didn't attend either, we need to take the minimum possible for each event. Because if the events have as few attendees as possible, then the remaining students can be as many as possible. \n\nSo the minimum number attending prom is 90, and debating is 70. The maximum overlap would be when all 70 debating attendees are part of the 90 prom attendees. Then the total number attending either is 90 (since all the debating ones are already in the prom group). So that leaves 200 -90 =110 students who didn't go to either. \n\nBut wait, the options have E as 110. But I need to check if that's possible. But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider that the numbers can't be lower than their minimums. Wait, but the problem says \"at least\" those percentages, so the actual numbers could be higher, but to find the maximum possible non-attendees, we take the minimal numbers. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a constraint that when you take the minimal numbers, the overlapping can't be more than the smaller of the two. Since the prom has at least 90, and debating at least 70, the maximum overlap is indeed 70. So the union is 90 +70 -70 =90. \n\nThus, the maximum possible number who didn't attend either is 110, so E. But wait, the options include E)110, so that would be the answer. \n\nWait, but let me see if another approach gives the same result. Let me think in terms of variables. Let P be the number of prom attendees (\u226590), D be debating (\u226570). The number who went to at least one is P + D - both. To minimize this, we need to maximize both. The maximum possible both is the minimum of P and D. Since P is at least 90 and D is at least 70, the maximum possible overlap is when D is 70 and all of them are in P. So the overlap is 70, so the total is 90+70-70=90. So yes, that gives 200-90=110. \n\nHmm, but the options include E)110, so that's the answer. But why does the question have other options? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the question again. \n\n\"at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session.\" So the minimums are 90 and 70. The question is the maximum number who could have neither. So the maximum number not in either is achieved when the overlap is as large as possible, so the union is as small as possible. So the calculation seems right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick where \"at least\" percentages mean that the numbers can't be lower than that, so the minimal possible union is 90+70 - 70 =90, leading to 110. So E is correct. \n\nBut wait, another thought: the problem says \"at least 45%\", so the prom could have exactly 45%, but the debating could have more. Wait, but to minimize the union, we want the debating to be as small as possible (since the minimum is 35%). So yes, 70 is the minimum for D, and 90 for P. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be E) 110. \n\nWait, but the options also include 99 (D), which is 200- (90+70 -0).
