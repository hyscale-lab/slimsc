      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about figuring out how many tempos are needed to lift 29,400 toys in one round. Hmm. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the question says five dozen toys are packed in a box. Oh right, a dozen is 12, so five dozen would be 5 times 12. Let me calculate that first. 5 times 12 is 60. So each box holds 60 toys. Got that part.\n\nThen, 98 boxes are kept in a tempo. So each tempo can carry 98 boxes. Wait, so to find out how many toys a tempo can carry, I need to multiply the number of boxes per tempo by the number of toys per box. That would be 98 boxes multiplied by 60 toys each. Let me do that math. 98 times 60... Hmm, 100 times 60 is 6000, so subtract 2 times 60 which is 120, so 6000 minus 120 is 5880. So each tempo can carry 5,880 toys.\n\nNow the total number of toys to be lifted is 29,400. So how many tempos are needed? I guess I need to divide the total toys by the capacity of one tempo. So 29,400 divided by 5,880. Let me compute that. \n\nHmm, maybe simplify the numbers. Let's see, 5,880 times 5 is 29,400. Wait, because 5,000 times 5 is 25,000 and 880 times 5 is 4,400. Adding those gives 29,400. Oh right! So 5 times 5,880 is exactly 29,400. That means the number of tempos needed is 5. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 5. So the answer should be B. Let me just check again to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \n\nWait, let me verify each step again. Five dozen per box is 60. 98 boxes per tempo, so 98 *60. 98*60: 90*60 is 5400, 8*60 is 480, so total 5400+480 = 5880. Correct. Then 29400 divided by 5880. 5880 *5 = 29400. Yep, so 5 tempos. That's option B. I think that's right.\n",
