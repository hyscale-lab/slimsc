      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem about the percentages of employees taking vacations. Hmm, so the question is asking for the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter one. Alright, let's break down the information given.\n\nFirst, the problem states that 75% take a winter vacation. Then, 40% take both winter and summer vacations. Also, 20% take neither. I think this is a problem involving sets and maybe a Venn diagram with two circles: one for winter and one for summer. \n\nLet me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The total percentage of employees taking either winter or summer vacation would be the sum of those taking winter and those taking summer, minus those taking both. But wait, the problem also mentions that 20% take neither, so the percentage taking at least one of the vacations must be 100% - 20% = 80%. \n\nLet me write down the formula:\n\nWinter \u222a Summer = Winter + Summer - Both\n\nWe know that Winter \u222a Summer is 80% (since 20% are outside). The Winter is 75%, and Both are 40%. Let me plug those numbers in:\n\n80% = 75% + Summer - 40%\n\nHmm, solving for Summer here. Let me rearrange the equation. \n\nSummer = 80% - 75% + 40% \n\nWait, that would be 80 minus 75 is 5, plus 40? Wait, no, let me do the math again. \n\nWait, the equation is:\n\nWinter + Summer - Both = 80%\n\nSo substituting:\n\n75% + S - 40% = 80%\n\nSo 75% -40% is 35%, so 35% + S = 80% \n\nTherefore, S = 80% - 35% = 45%? So the percentage taking summer is 45%?\n\nWait, but the question is asking for those who take summer but not winter. \n\nRight, because the 45% includes those who took both. So to find the ones who took summer only, we subtract the ones who took both. \n\nSo Summer only = Summer total - Both = 45% -40% =5%. That would be option A. But wait, 5% seems really low, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. \n\nLet me go through the steps again. \n\nTotal employees: 100%. \n\nNeither vacations:20%, so 80% take at least one. \n\nWinter is 75%, both are 40%. \n\nSo using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nWinter \u222a Summer = 75 + S - 40 = 80 \n\nSo 75 + S -40 = 80 \u2192 (75-40) + S = 80 \u2192 35 + S = 80 \u2192 S = 45. \n\nSo summer total is 45%. \n\nSo summer only would be S minus both: 45-40=5. \n\nHmm, so the answer would be 5%, option A. But the options have A as 5%, which matches. \n\nWait, but maybe I did something wrong here. Let me think differently. \n\nAlternatively, let's use a Venn diagram approach. Imagine two overlapping circles: Winter (W) and Summer (S). The overlap is the 40%. \n\nThe total in W is 75%, so the part of W that's not overlapping is 75-40=35%. \n\nThe total in S would be the overlap plus the summer-only part. Let's call summer-only x. \n\nSo total in S is 40 + x. \n\nThe total in either W or S is 35 (winter only) +40 (both) +x (summer only) = 75 +x. \n\nBut we know that the total in either is 80% (since 20% are neither). \n\nSo 75 +x =80 \u2192 x=5. \n\nAh, that's the same answer. So the summer-only is 5%, so answer A. \n\nWait, but the options given are A to E, with A being 5%, so that must be correct. \n\nHmm. But let me check again. Maybe I messed up the neither part. \n\nTotal is 100%. \n\nWinter only: 75% -40% both =35. \n\nSummer only: 5. \n\nBoth:40. \n\nNeither:20. \n\nAdding those up: 35+5+40+20=100. That adds correctly. \n\n35+40 is 75 (winter total), 5+40 is 45 (summer total). \n\nYes, so the summer only is indeed 5%. So the answer must be A.\n",

And total in either is 35 (only winter) + 40 (both) + summer only = 75 + summer only - but wait, no. Wait the total in either is only winter plus both plus summer only? Wait no, summer only plus only winter plus both. So total is (W only) + (S only) + both. Wait but W only is 75-40 =35. S only is S -40. So total is 35 + (S-40) +40 = 35 + S. That equals 80.
