      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this math problem: 25 divided by 12 multiplied by 5. Hmm, let me think. Wait, the question is written as 25/12*5. Oh right, I should remember the order of operations here. Since division and multiplication are at the same level, I should go from left to right. So first, do 25 divided by 12, and then multiply that result by 5.\n\nLet me calculate 25 divided by 12 first. Let me do that division. 12 goes into 25 twice, which is 24. Subtract 24 from 25, that leaves 1. So 25/12 is 2 and 1/12. Converting that to a decimal, 1/12 is approximately 0.083333... So 25/12 is about 2.083333...\n\nNow multiply that by 5. Let's do 2.083333... times 5. Let me break it down. 2 times 5 is 10, and 0.083333 times 5 is 0.416666... Adding those together gives 10 + 0.416666... which equals 10.416666... Wait a second, that doesn't match any of the options given here. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are A)2.5498, B)0.4167, C)3.3987, D)8.5497, E)5.6312. Hmm, none of these are close to 10.4166. Did I do something wrong here? Maybe I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5)? Oh, that would change things. Because if it's 25/(12*5), then that's 25/60, which is 0.416666..., which is option B. But the original question is written as 25/12*5. Without parentheses, according to order of operations, it's (25/12)*5. But maybe the problem was intended to be 25/(12*5). Because otherwise the answer isn't in the options. Let me see the options again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate. 25 divided by 12. Let me do that division again. 12 into 25. 12*2 is 24. So 2.083333... Multiply by 5: 2.083333 *5. Let's do this step by step. 2*5 is 10. 0.083333 *5 is 0.416665. So total is 10.416665... So that's about 10.4167. But none of the options are near that. The closest is D)8.5497? Not even close. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says \"Find 25/12*5\". Maybe it's 25 divided by (12*5) instead? Then that would be 25 divided by 60, which is 0.416666..., which is option B. But according to order of operations, it should be left to right. So (25/12)*5 is indeed 10.416..., but that's not an option. So that must mean that perhaps the question was written with a different interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a typo in the options. But given that the options include B as 0.4167, which would be the result of 25/(12*5), perhaps the question was intended to have parentheses. Maybe the user made a mistake in writing the problem. Since the options don't have the correct answer for left-to-right interpretation, maybe the correct answer here is B, assuming that the division is meant to be over the entire product. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to check if the question is written correctly. Let me see the options again. The options given are A)2.5498, B)0.4167, C)3.3987, D)8.5497, E)5.6312. None of these are 10.4, so perhaps the question is 25 divided by (12*5), so 25/60 = 0.416666... which is B. So maybe the question is written with a different order of operations. Maybe the multiplication is considered first? But according to standard PEMDAS, division and multiplication have equal precedence and are evaluated left to right. So the correct calculation would be (25/12)*5. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question has a typo, or I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5), which would be 25/(12\u00d75)=25/60=0.416666..., which is option B. So perhaps the question was written as 25/(12\u00d75) but presented without parentheses. Since that is one of the options, and given that the user might have intended that, perhaps that's the answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check once again.\n\nWait, 25 divided by 12 is 2.083333... Multiply that by 5: 2.083333 *5. Let me do it another way. 2.083333 *5. Let's write 2.083333 as a fraction. 25/12. So (25/12)*5 = (25*5)/12 = 125/12. Let me compute 125 divided by 12. 12*10=120, so 125-120=5. So 10 and 5/12. 5/12 is approximately 0.416666..., so total is 10.416666... So that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the problem is that the options don't have that. So maybe the question was supposed to be 25 divided by (12*5), which gives 0.416666..., which is option B. So the user might have intended that. Alternatively, perhaps the question is written as 25/(12*5). Since that is the only answer that matches the options, perhaps the answer is B. So maybe the original problem had parentheses but was written without. Since the options include B, perhaps that's the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Wait, the question says \"Find 25/12*5\". Maybe the multiplication is meant to be in the denominator. But unless there's a parenthesis, that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the question is written as 25 divided by (12*5). So given the options, the correct answer here is B, even though strictly following order of operations gives a different result. Since the options don't have the correct answer for left-to-right, perhaps the question had a different structure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the order of operations. Let me confirm. The order of operations: Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division from left to right. So 25/12*5 is indeed (25/12)*5 = 125/12 \u224810.4167. But none of the options have that. So the options must have an error, but since the user is asking to choose from them, perhaps there's another way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is (25/12) multiplied by 5. But that's the same as before. Wait, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5). Let me check the options again. If that's the case, then 25/(12\u00d75)=25/60=0.416666..., which is B. So maybe the user intended that, even if written without parentheses. Since that's the only option that makes sense, I'll go with B as the answer. So the correct answer is B)0.4167.\n",

But that gives 10.416. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question was written differently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5) which would be 25/(12\u00d75) = 25/60 = 5/12 \u2248 0.4167, which is option B.

So unless there's a different interpretation here. Wait, maybe the question is (25/12)*5, but maybe the options are wrong? But that's not likely. Let me see the options again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute 25 divided by 12 multiplied by 5 as fractions. 25/12 times 5 is (25\u00d75)/12 = 125/12. Let's divide 125 by 12. 12*10=120, so 125-120=5. So that's 10 and 5/12. 5 divided by 12 is approximately 0.416666..., so total is 10.416666..., which is about 10.4167. But that's not an option here. The options given are A)2.5498, B)0.4167, C)3.3987, D)8.5497, E)5.6312. None of these match. Wait, so maybe there's a mistake in the question, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5), which would be 25/(12\u00d75) = 25/60 = 5/12 = approximately 0.4167, which is option B. But that's only if the multiplication is done before the division. Since order of operations requires left to right for same precedence. Unless the question was written as 25/(12*5), which would be different. Since the user wrote it as 25/12*5, perhaps the user intended division first? But according to standard rules, it's (25/12)*5.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Since the options don't have 10.4, perhaps the question is written differently. Let me check again. Wait, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 divided by 5)? Which would be 25/(12/5) = 25*(5/12) = 125/12 \u224810.4167, but that's still not in the options. Alternatively, maybe the question is (25/12)*5, but the options have a typo. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me re-calculate 125 divided by 12. 12\u00d710=120, so 125-120=5. So 5/12 is 0.416666..., so total is 10.416666... So that's correct. \n\nWait, looking back at the options again, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. The options are:\n\nA)2.5498\n\nB)0.4167\n\nC)3.3987\n\nD)8.5497\n\nE)5.6312\n\nHmm. None of these are 10.416. So perhaps the question was mistyped? Like maybe 25 divided by 12 multiplied by 5 is a different expression. Alternatively, maybe it's 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5) which is B. Or perhaps the problem is written as 25/(12*5). Since that's possible, but then why would the question be written that way? The user wrote it as 25/12*5, so left to right. But that gives an answer not in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way of interpreting the question. Wait, perhaps the question is (25/12)*5, but in the options, maybe the decimal is different. Let me see the options again. Option D is 8.5497. Hmm, how would that come? Let me see: 25 divided by (12 divided by 5) is 25/(2.4) = 10.416..., no. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Wait, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5), so 25/(60)=0.4167 (option B). That's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question was supposed to be 25 divided by (12*5), but the user wrote it as 25/12*5. So in that case, the correct answer would be B. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the arithmetic. Let me try again:\n\n25 divided by 12: 12*2=24, so 25-24=1, so 25/12 = 2.083333...\n\nMultiply that by 5: 2.083333... *5. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 2 *5 =10. 0.083333 *5 =0.416665. Adding together: 10+0.416665=10.416665. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't have that, but option D is 8.5497. Wait, maybe I need to compute 25 multiplied by (12 divided by 5). Let's see: 12 divided by 5 is 2.4. 25*2.4 = 60. That's even higher. Not in options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is 25 multiplied by (12 divided by 5). Wait, that would be 25*(12/5) = (25/5)*12=5*12=60, which is not an option. \n\nHmm, this is perplexing. Since the correct calculation gives 10.416666..., which is not among the options, but the options include B)0.4167. That's exactly 5/12. So maybe the question was supposed to be 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5), which is 25/(60) = 5/12 \u22480.4167. So perhaps the user made a mistake in writing the question, or there's a typo. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is written as 25/(12*5), which would be option B. Since that's the only one that matches. Given that the options don't have the correct answer according to left-to-right, but option B is the result of the alternative grouping, perhaps that's the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the question to be 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5), so the answer is B. Since that's the only plausible option here, even though according to order of operations, the correct calculation isn't listed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is written as 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5), which is 25/(12\u00d75)=25/60=5/12\u22480.4167. So option B. \n\nTherefore, given that the options don't have the correct answer, but the closest possible is B, perhaps that's the intended answer. Maybe I made a mistake in thinking that division and multiplication are left to right? Wait, let me confirm order of operations. \n\nYes, according to PEMDAS, multiplication and division have the same priority and are evaluated left to right. So 25/12*5 is (25/12)*5 = (25*5)/12 = 125/12 \u224810.4167. Since that's not an option, but the question must have an answer among the given options. Therefore, there must be an error either in the question's presentation or perhaps I misunderstood the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was supposed to be (25/5)/12? Let's see: 25 divided by 5 is 5, then divided by 12 is 5/12\u22480.4167, which is B. That would make sense. So maybe the original question had parentheses misplaced. Alternatively, maybe the user intended 25 divided by (12*5). \n\nGiven that the options include B, which is 0.4167, I think the question might have been written with the multiplication intended to come before the division, so that the correct answer is B. Since the problem as presented doesn't have that answer, but given the options, B must be the intended choice. So the answer is B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem \\( \\frac{25}{12} \\times 5 \\), we follow the order of operations (left to right for division and multiplication).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here: 25 divided by 12 multiplied by 5. Hmm, let me think. Wait, the question is written as 25/12*5. Oh right, I need to remember the order of operations here. Since division and multiplication are at the same level, I should go from left to right. So first, I do 25 divided by 12, and then multiply that result by 5.\n\nLet me calculate 25 divided by 12 first. Let's see, 12 goes into 25 twice, which is 24. So 25 minus 24 is 1. So that's 2 and 1/12. As a decimal, 1/12 is approximately 0.0833... So 2.0833... Then I multiply that by 5. \n\nHmm, 2.0833 times 5. Let me break it down. 2 times 5 is 10, and 0.0833 times 5 is about 0.4165. Adding those together gives 10.4165. Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are 10.4165. Wait a second, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the options given are A)2.5498, B)0.4167, C)3.3987, D)8.5497, E)5.6312. None of these are close to 10.4. That can't be right. Did I misinterpret the question? Oh, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5)? But the way it's written is 25/12*5, which according to order of operations should be (25/12)*5. But perhaps the user intended it differently?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I miscalculated. Let me try again. 25 divided by 12 is 2.083333..., right? Multiply that by 5. Let me do that step again. 2.0833 multiplied by 5. 2 *5 is 10, 0.0833 *5 is 0.4165, so total is 10.4165. But that's not among the options. Hmm. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I did the division wrong. Let me check 25 divided by 12 again. 12 times 2 is 24, so 25-24 is 1. So yes, 25/12 is indeed 2.0833... So multiplying by 5 gives 10.416...\n\nBut looking at the options, the closest is D)8.5497. Wait, that's way off. Wait maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. \"Find 25/12*5\". The options are A to E. Oh! Wait a second, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12*5), which would be 25/(60) = 0.416666..., which is option B. But the way it's written without parentheses would be left to right, so (25/12)*5. But that gives 10.416. Since that's not an option, perhaps the question was written differently?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a typo in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5) which would be 25/(12\u00d75) = 25/60 = 5/12 \u2248 0.4167, which is option B. But according to standard order of operations, division and multiplication have equal precedence and are evaluated left to right. So 25/12 first, then times 5. So unless there's a different interpretation here. Wait, maybe the question is (25/12)*5, but maybe the options are wrong? But that's not likely. Let me see the options again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try a different approach. Let's compute 25 divided by 12 multiplied by 5 as fractions. 25/12 times 5 is (25\u00d75)/12 = 125/12. Let's divide 125 by 12. 12*10=120, so 125-120=5. So that's 10 and 5/12. 5 divided by 12 is approximately 0.416666..., so total is 10.416666..., which is about 10.4167. But that's not an option here. The options given are A)2.5498, B)0.4167, C)3.3987, D)8.5497, E)5.6312. None of these match. Wait, so maybe there's a mistake in the question, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5), which would be 25/(12\u00d75) = 25/60 = 5/12 = approximately 0.4167, which is option B. But that's only if the multiplication is done before the division. Since order of operations requires left to right for same precedence. Unless the question was written as 25/(12*5), which would be different. Since the user wrote it as 25/12*5, perhaps the user intended division first? But according to standard rules, it's (25/12)*5.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Since the options don't have 10.4, perhaps the question is written differently. Let me check again. Wait, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 divided by 5)? Which would be 25/(12/5) = 25*(5/12) = 125/12 \u224810.4167, but that's still not in the options. Alternatively, maybe the question is (25/12)*5, but the options have a typo. Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me re-calculate 125 divided by 12. 12\u00d710=120, so 125-120=5. So 5/12 is 0.416666..., so total is 10.416666... So that's correct. \n\nWait, looking back at the options again, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. The options are:\n\nA)2.5498\n\nB)0.4167\n\nC)3.3987\n\nD)8.5497\n\nE)5.6312\n\nHmm. None of these are 10.416. So perhaps the question was mistyped? Like maybe 25 divided by 12 multiplied by 5 is a different expression. Alternatively, maybe it's 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5) which is B. Or perhaps the problem is written as 25/(12*5). Since that's possible, but then why would the question be written that way? The user wrote it as 25/12*5, so left to right. But that gives an answer not in the options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way of interpreting the question. Wait, perhaps the question is (25/12)*5, but in the options, maybe the decimal is different. Let me see the options again. Option D is 8.5497. Hmm, how would that come? Let me see: 25 divided by (12 divided by 5) is 25/(2.4) = 10.416..., no. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the order. Wait, maybe the question is 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5), so 25/(60)=0.4167 (option B). That's possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question was supposed to be 25 divided by (12*5), but the user wrote it as 25/12*5. So in that case, the correct answer would be B. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the arithmetic. Let me try again:\n\n25 divided by 12: 12*2=24, so 25-24=1, so 25/12 = 2.083333...\n\nMultiply that by 5: 2.083333... *5. Let's do this multiplication step by step. 2 *5 =10. 0.083333 *5 =0.416665. Adding together: 10+0.416665=10.416665. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't have that, but option D is 8.5497. Wait, maybe I need to compute 25 multiplied by (12 divided by 5). Let's see: 12 divided by 5 is 2.4. 25*2.4 = 60. That's even higher. Not in options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is 25 multiplied by (12 divided by 5). Wait, that would be 25*(12/5) = (25/5)*12=5*12=60, which is not an option. \n\nHmm, this is perplexing. Since the correct calculation gives 10.416666..., which is not among the options, but the options include B)0.4167. That's exactly 5/12. So maybe the question was supposed to be 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5), which is 25/(60) = 5/12 \u22480.4167. So perhaps the user made a mistake in writing the question, or there's a typo. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is written as 25/(12*5), which would be option B. Since that's the only one that matches. Given that the options don't have the correct answer according to left-to-right, but option B is the result of the alternative grouping, perhaps that's the intended answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended the question to be 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5), so the answer is B. Since that's the only plausible option here, even though according to order of operations, the correct calculation isn't listed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is written as 25 divided by (12 multiplied by 5), which is 25/(12\u00d75)=25/60=5/12\u22480.4167. So option B. \n\nTherefore, given that the options don't have the correct answer, but the closest possible is B, perhaps that's the intended answer. Maybe I made a mistake in thinking that division and multiplication are left to right? Wait, let me confirm order of operations. \n\nYes, according to PEMDAS, multiplication and division have the same priority and are evaluated left to right. So 25/12*5 is (25/12)*5 = (25*5)/12 = 125/12 \u224810.4167. Since that's not an option, but the question must have an answer among the given options. Therefore, there must be an error either in the question's presentation or perhaps I misunderstood the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question was supposed to be (25/5)/12? Let's see: 25 divided by 5 is 5, then divided by 12 is 5/12\u22480.4167, which is B. That would make sense. So maybe the original question had parentheses misplaced. Alternatively, maybe the user intended 25 divided by (12*5). \n\nGiven that the options include B, which is 0.4167, I think the question might have been written with the multiplication intended to come before the division, so that the correct answer is B. Since the problem as presented doesn't have that answer, but given the options, B must be the intended choice. So the answer is B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem \\( \\frac{25}{12} \\times 5 \\), we follow the order of operations (left to right for division and multiplication).
