      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem says that when 30 is subtracted from a number, it's reduced to one third of its original value. I need to find 50% of that number. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me denote the original number as, say, x. So the problem states that if I subtract 30 from x, the result is one third of x. So the equation would be something like x minus 30 equals (1/3)x. Wait, let me write that out properly:\n\nx - 30 = (1/3)x.\n\nWait a second, is that correct? Let me think again. The original number is x. Subtracting 30 gives a value that's one third of the original. So yes, the equation should be x minus 30 equals (1/3)x. But when I solve this equation, maybe I can rearrange terms. Let me subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get:\n\nx - (1/3)x -30 =0. \n\nHmm, combining the x terms: (2/3)x -30 =0. Then, adding 30 to both sides gives (2/3)x =30. Then, solving for x would mean multiplying both sides by 3/2. So x= 30*(3/2)=45? Wait, but then 50% of x would be 22.5. But option A is 22.5, which is an option here. Wait, but let me check the options again. The options given are A)22.5, B)84, C)21, D)24, E)25. So 22.5 is an option. But let me verify again because sometimes I might have made a mistake in setting up the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I misunderstood the problem. The problem says \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" So maybe the equation should be (number -30) = (1/3) of the original number. Which is exactly what I did. So if the original number is 45, subtracting 30 gives 15, which is indeed a third of 45. That checks out. Then 50% of 45 is 22.5, so the answer would be A. But wait, let me check the options again. Wait, option D is 24. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased differently. Let me read it again: \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" So the original number minus 30 equals one third of the original. So yes, equation is correct. Then x is 45, so 50% is 22.5. So A is the answer. But let me see the options again. Wait, the options have A)22.5, so that's possible. But maybe I made a mistake in calculation?\n\nWait another way: Let me try plugging in the options. Let's see, the question is asking for 50% of the number. Let's suppose that 50% of x is, say, 22.5, so x is 45. Then 45 -30 =15, which is indeed 1/3 of 45. So that works. Alternatively, if someone thought the equation was x - (1/3)x =30, that would be different. Let's see, that equation would be (2/3)x=30, so x=45 again. Wait, same result. Because x minus a third of x is two-thirds x equals 30. So that's the same as before. Hmm. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's wording? Let me check again. \"30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one third.\" The wording could be interpreted as subtracting 30 reduces the number to one third of its original value. So yes, that's exactly the equation. So the answer is A)22.5. But why are there other options here?\n\nWait, let me check another possible mistake. Suppose the equation was set up as (x -30) = (1/3)(x -30). Wait no, that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the problem was when 30 is subtracted, the result is one third of the result. Wait no, the problem states \"it is reduced to its one third.\" So \"it\" refers to the number. So the result after subtraction is one third of the original number. So the equation is correct.\n\nHmm, so I think the correct answer is A)22.5. But let me check another angle. Suppose the problem is saying that after subtracting 30, the number becomes one third of what it was. So original is x, subtract 30 gives (1/3)x, so same equation. So solving gives x=45. 50% of that is 22.5. So answer A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is phrased as \"reduced by one third\" which would be different. Like if it's reduced by a third, meaning subtract a third, but the wording here is \"reduced to one third\", so that's different. So I think the setup is correct. So the answer must be A.\n",

Let's call the number we're looking for \"x\". The problem states that subtracting 30 from x makes it one third of the original. So, in equation form, that would be x minus 30 equals one third of x.

So the equation should be:\n\nx - 30 = (1/3)x ?\n\nWait, no, maybe I got that reversed. Let me think again. If subtracting 30 reduces it to a third, then the original number minus 30 equals one third of the original. So yes, x -30 = (1/3)x. Hmm, but that would mean that x - (1/3)x = 30. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set it up correctly. Let me rephrase the problem. Let me see, the original number is x. When you subtract 30, the result is (1/3)x. So:\n\nx - 30 = (1/3)x\n\nYes, that's right. So solving for x:\n\nx - (1/3)x = 30\n\nThat simplifies to (2/3)x = 30. Then x would be 30 divided by (2/3), which is 30 multiplied by 3/2.

So the answer must be A. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a calculation mistake. Let me check again. 45 divided by 2 is 22.5. Yes. So the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote the unknown number as \\( x \\). According to the problem, subtracting 30 from this number reduces it to one-third of its original value. This can be written as the equation:\n\n\\[\nx - 30 = \\frac{1}{3}x\n\\]\n\nRearranging the equation to solve for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx - \\frac{1}{3}x = 30 \\\\\n\\frac{2}{3}x = 30 \\\\\nx = 30 \\times \\frac{3}{2} \\\\\nx = 45\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to find 50% of this number. Calculating 50% of 45:\n\n\\[\n0.5 \\times 45 = 22.5\n\\]\n\nThus, the value of 50% of the number is 22.5, which corresponds to option A.\n\nAnswer: A",
