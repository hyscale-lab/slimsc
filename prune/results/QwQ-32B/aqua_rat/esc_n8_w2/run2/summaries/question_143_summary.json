      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so there's this problem about two cars leaving from the same place at the same time, going the same direction. The first car is going 55 mph, the second 52 mph. The question is asking how long it'll take before they're 15 miles apart. Hmm, right. Let me think.\n\nAlright, since they're moving in the same direction, their speeds relative to each other matter here. The faster car is pulling away from the slower one. The difference in their speeds should determine how quickly the distance between them increases. So, the relative speed is 55 minus 52, which is 3 mph. Oh right, because each hour, the first car gains 3 miles on the second. \n\nSo the question is, how long does it take for that 3 mph difference to create a 15-mile gap? I remember that time equals distance divided by speed. So, time = 15 miles divided by 3 mph. Let me do that calculation. 15 divided by 3 is 5. So that would be 5 hours. Wait, but let me check the options. Option B is 5 hours, so that's probably the answer. \n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't mix up the formula. Like, if the relative speed is 3 mph, then every hour, the distance increases by 3 miles. So after t hours, the distance between them is 3t. We set that equal to 15: 3t =15. Solving for t gives t=5. Yeah, that checks out. So the answer should be B)5 hours. \n\nHmm, but let me think again. Sometimes these problems can trick you. Are there any other factors here? Like, maybe they start at the same time, so no initial distance. So yes, starting from same point. So the separation starts immediately. So yes, the calculation is correct. So the answer is B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so there's this problem about two cars leaving the same place at the same time, going the same direction. The first car is going faster than the second, right? The question is asking how long it takes until they're 15 miles apart. Hmm, let me think.\n\nAlright, the first car's speed is 55 mph, and the second is 52 mph. Since they're going the same direction, the distance between them increases over time. The difference in their speeds must be important here. Oh right, the relative speed between them is the key. So the speed at which the distance between them grows is the difference between their speeds. \n\nLet me calculate that. 55 minus 52 equals 3 mph. So every hour, the first car gets 3 miles farther ahead. The question is, how many hours does it take for that distance to reach 15 miles? \n\nSo, if they're moving apart at 3 mph, then time equals distance divided by speed. The required distance is 15 miles. So time would be 15 divided by 3. That gives 5 hours. Wait, but let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should set up an equation. Let's say after t hours, the distance between them is 15 miles. The distance the first car has gone is 55t, and the second is 52t. The difference between these two distances should be 15. \n\nSo 55t - 52t = 15. That simplifies to 3t =15, so t is 5. Yeah, that matches what I thought before. So the answer should be B)5 hours. \n\nWait, but let me look at the options again. The options are A)3, B)5, C)6, D)4, E)7. So B is 5. That's what I got. Hmm, I think that's correct. Maybe I didn't make any mistakes here. The logic seems straightforward. The relative speed is 3 mph, so time to get 15 miles apart is 15/3=5. Yep. I think that's right.\n",
