      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a shopkeeper who gave a 20% discount one day and now needs to raise the price back to the original. The question is asking by what percentage he must increase the discounted price to get back to the original. Hmm.\n\nSo, let me think. Let's say the original price of an item is, I don't know, $100. That's an easy number to work with. If there's a 20% discount, then the discounted price would be 80% of the original. So 20% off of $100 is $20, so the discounted price is $80. \n\nNow, the next day, he wants to sell it again at the original price, which is $100. So he has to increase the discounted price from $80 back to $100. The question is, what's the percentage increase needed on the $80 to get to $100?\n\nTo find the percentage increase, the formula is: ((New Price - Old Price)/Old Price) * 100. Here, the old price after discount is $80, and the new desired price is $100. So the difference is $20. \n\nSo plugging in the numbers: (20 / 80) * 100. Let's calculate that. 20 divided by 80 is 0.25. Multiply by 100 gives 25%. So the percentage increase needed is 25%. \n\nWait a second, but why isn't it 20%? Because the discount was 20%, but the base here is different. The discount was 20% off the original price, but the increase is based on the discounted price. So the base for the percentage changes. That's a common mistake, right? Like, if you decrease by a certain percentage and then increase by the same, you don't get back to the original because the base changes.\n\nSo the correct answer here should be 25%, which is option C. Let me check the options again. The options are A)21%, B)20%, C)25%, D)33%, E)18%. Yep, C is 25%, so that's the right one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try with another example to confirm. Let's take original price as $50. 20% discount would be $10 off, so new price is $40. To get back to $50 from $40, the increase is $10. So (10/40)*100 = 25% again. Yep, same result. So definitely 25%.\n",
