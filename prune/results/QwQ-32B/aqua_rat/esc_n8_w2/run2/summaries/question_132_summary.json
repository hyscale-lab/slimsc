      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this math problem. Hmm, the question is [(272 - 32) multiplied by (124 + 176)] divided by (17 times 15 minus 15). I need to compute that and see which option it matches. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's handle the numerator part. The numerator is (272 - 32) multiplied by (124 + 176). Let me compute each part separately. \n\nStarting with 272 minus 32. Oh, that's straightforward. 272 minus 30 would be 242, then subtract 2 more gives 240. So that part is 240. \n\nNext, the other bracket in the numerator is 124 plus 176. Let me add those. 124 + 176... 100+100 is 200, 24+76 is 100, so total is 300? Wait, let me check again. 124 plus 176: 120 + 170 is 290, and 4+6 is 10, so 290+10=300. Yep, that's right. So the numerator becomes 240 multiplied by 300. \n\nNow, 240 * 300. Let me calculate that. 24*3 is 72, and then there are three zeros (two from 300 and one from 240's 240?), wait, no. Wait, 240 is 24*10, and 300 is 3*100. So multiplying them gives 24*3 * 10*100 = 72 * 1000 = 72,000. So the numerator is 72,000.\n\nNow the denominator is (17 times 15 minus 15). Let me compute that. First, 17 multiplied by 15. 17*15... 10*15=150 and 7*15=105, so 150+105=255. Then subtract 15. So 255 -15 = 240. \n\nSo the denominator is 240. \n\nPutting it all together, the entire expression is 72,000 divided by 240. Let me do that division. Hmm, 240 times 300 is 72,000, right? Because 240 * 300 = 72,000. So 72,000 divided by 240 would be 300? Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 240 x 300 is indeed 72,000, so 72000 \u00f7240 is 300. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 300. So the answer should be C?\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through each step again.\n\nFirst part of numerator: 272 -32. 272 minus 30 is 242, minus 2 more is 240. Correct. Second part: 124+176. 124 + 176 = 300. Yes. Multiplying those gives 240 *300 = 72,000. \n\nDenominator: 17*15. Let me recalculate that. 17*10 is 170, 17*5 is 85, so total 170+85=255. Then subtract 15 gives 240. So denominator is 240. \n\n72,000 divided by 240: Let me see. 240 times 100 is 24,000. 24,000 *3 is 72,000. So 240 *300 is 72,000. So dividing 72,000 by 240 gives exactly 300. \n\nSo the answer is C)300. Wait, but the options given are A)0, B)2.25, C)300, D)400, E)None of these. So C is an option. So the correct answer must be C. \n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the order of operations? Let me check the original expression again. The question is [(272 -32)(124+176)] divided by (17\u00d715 -15). The brackets around the numerator's two terms probably mean multiplication between them. So yes, (272-32) multiplied by (124+176) is correct. The denominator is (17\u00d715 -15). So all steps are correct. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is option C. So the answer should be C. But wait, maybe I missed a step? Let me see again. The numerator is (240)*(300) =72000. Denominator 240. So 72000/240 = 300. Yes. So option C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there was a miscalculation with the denominator? Let me check the denominator again. 17\u00d715 is 255, minus 15 is 240. Correct. \n\nHmm, everything checks out. The answer should be C.\n",

Let's see, 224 + 70 is 294, plus 6 is 300. Oh, that's nice, so that's 300. So the numerator is 240 multiplied by 300. Let me calculate that. 240 times 300. Well, 24 times 3 is 72, and then add four zeros (since 240 is 24*10 and 300 is 3*100, so total 10*100 is 1000). Wait, 240 * 300 = 240 * 3 * 100 = 720 * 100 = 72,000? Wait, no, 240 times 300.
