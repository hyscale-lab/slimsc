      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the perimeter of a rectangle. The question says the rectangle has a length of 8 centimeters and a width of 3 centimeters. The options are A)18cm, B)22cm, C)20cm, D)30cm, E)28cm. Hmm, right. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the perimeter of a shape is the total distance around its edges. For a rectangle, that means adding up all the sides. But wait, rectangles have opposite sides equal, right? So there are two sides of the length and two sides of the width. \n\nThe formula for perimeter of a rectangle must be something like 2 times length plus 2 times width. Or maybe there's a simpler way to remember it. Oh yeah, sometimes I've heard it as 2*(length + width). Let me confirm that. If I take the length and width, add them together first, then multiply by two, that should give the same result as adding both pairs of sides. So either way works.\n\nLet me plug in the numbers here. The length is 8 cm, width is 3 cm. So using the formula 2*(length + width), that would be 2*(8 + 3). Let's compute that. 8 plus 3 is 11. Then multiply by 2 gives 22. Wait, so that would be 22 centimeters. So looking at the options, B is 22cm. \n\nBut hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the alternative way. If I calculate 2*length + 2*width. 2*8 is 16, and 2*3 is 6. Adding those together gives 16 +6 = 22. Yeah, same answer. So that seems right.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up length and width. The problem states length is 8 cm and width 3 cm. So yes, that's correct. So the perimeter should be 2*(8+3)=22. So the answer must be B)22cm. Let me check the options again. The options are A)18, which would be if someone added 8+3+8+3 and forgot to add correctly. Let's see 8+3 is 11, plus another 8+3 is another 11, so total 22. Yeah, that's right. So 22 is correct. \n\nHmm, but wait another thought. Maybe someone could think perimeter is just length plus width and multiply by something else? Like maybe 8*2 is 16 plus 3 is 19? No, that doesn't make sense. No, the formula is definitely two times each. So the answer is B. I think that's solid. Let me just visualize the rectangle. If each long side is 8 and the short sides are 3, then going around would be 8 +3 +8 +3. Adding those all up: 8+8 is 16, 3+3 is 6. 16+6=22. Yep. Definitely B.\n",
