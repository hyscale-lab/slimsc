      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about calculating the new expenditure percentage after a salary increase. Hmm, the man originally spends 70% of his income. Then his income goes up by 20%, and we need to find out what percentage his new expenditure is of his new income. Wait, but the problem doesn't say if his expenditure increases proportionally or stays the same in absolute terms. Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, maybe I need to read it again.\n\nThe question says, \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" Oh, right, the way it's phrased, maybe the expenditure amount remains the same? Or does it increase with the income? Wait, the problem might be implying that his expenditure increases in such a way that the percentage is now different. Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the man's expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income? Or maybe the expenditure in absolute terms stays the same, so the percentage would change. Hmm, I need to figure out which interpretation is correct here.\n\nWait, let's think again. The problem says \"spends 70% of his income.\" So initially, his expenditure is 70% of his original income. Now, if his income increases by 20%, the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. But does the expenditure stay the same in absolute terms, or does it also increase? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps there's an assumption here. Wait, maybe the question is from the context of problems where when income increases, the expenditure increases by the same percentage? Or maybe the expenditure increases but the percentage is what's being asked. Wait, perhaps the question is expecting us to think that the expenditure in absolute terms remains the same. Wait, but that would make sense if the question is asking for the new percentage of expenditure relative to the new income. Alternatively, maybe the expenditure increases by the same 20%, so the percentage remains 70%? But that would not be one of the options. Hmm, the options are all different percentages. So that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expenditure is the same in absolute terms. Let me try that approach. Let me assume that the man's expenditure doesn't change. Let me set up some variables. Let's say his original income is I. Then his original expenditure is 0.7I. His savings would be 0.3I. Now, his income increases by 20%, so the new income is I + 0.2I = 1.2I. If his expenditure remains the same (i.e., he still spends 0.7I), then the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income would be (0.7I / 1.2I) * 100. The I cancels out, so 0.7 / 1.2 = 0.58333..., which is 58.333...%, so that would be option A, 58.3%. But wait, the options include A as 58.3% which matches. But wait, maybe that's the right answer? Hmm. But let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expenditure increases by the same 20%, so the expenditure becomes 70% * 1.2 = 84% of original income? Wait no, that's not right. Let me see. If his income increases by 20%, but if he keeps the same spending habits, maybe his expenditure also increases by 20%, so his expenditure becomes 70% * 1.2 = 84% of original income. Wait, but that's not the right way to calculate. Let me try with actual numbers. Let's suppose his original income is, say, $100. Then he spends 70% of that, so $70. His income increases by 20%, so new income is $120. If he continues to spend the same $70, then the new expenditure as a percentage of income is 70/120 *100 = 58.333...%, so that's option A. But if his expenditure increases by 20%, then he would spend 70*1.2 = $84. Then, his expenditure would be 84/120 = 70% again. But that would mean the percentage remains the same, which isn't an option here. Since the options don't have 70%, that can't be the case. Therefore, the question must be assuming that the expenditure remains the same in absolute terms. Therefore the answer is A) 58.3%. \n\nWait, but looking back at the options given, the first option is 58.3%, which matches. But let me check again. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. The question says, \"what will be his new expenditure?\" Maybe the question is implying that the expenditure also increases by the same 20% as his income? But then the percentage would stay the same. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is different. Wait, maybe the problem is a trick question where the man's expenditure is now a higher percentage. Wait, perhaps the question is expecting that the man's expenditure increases by the same 20% as his income, but the options don't have that. Wait, let me think again. Wait, maybe the problem is not saying that his expenditure remains the same, but that he continues to spend the same percentage. Wait, the wording is ambiguous. Wait, the original problem says \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" The wording is a bit unclear. The question could be interpreted in two ways: \n\n1. The man continues to spend 70% of his income, so his new expenditure is still 70% (so the answer would not be listed here, but that's not possible since options don't include that). \n\n2. His expenditure in absolute terms stays the same, so the percentage drops. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Wait, maybe the question is from the perspective of the expenditure increasing in line with the income. Wait, perhaps the problem is in another way. Let me see the options again. The options are 58.3, 62.5, 63.5, etc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Let me think again. Let me try with numbers. Let's take an example. Suppose his original income is 100. \n\nOriginal income: 100. \nSpends 70%: 70. \nSavings: 30. \n\nIncome increases by 20%: new income is 120. \n\nNow, what is the new expenditure? \n\nIf he maintains the same expenditure (70), then it's 70/120 = 58.33%, so option A. \n\nAlternatively, if he spends the same proportion of the new income as before, then it's 70% of 120 = 84. But that's 70%, so that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe his savings rate remains the same? Wait, the problem doesn't say that. Wait, the problem says \"spends 70%\", so that's expenditure. The question is, when income increases by 20%, what is his new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. Unless the question is implying that his expenditure increases by 20% as well. Wait, but then expenditure would be 70 *1.2 =84, so 84/120 = 70% again. So that's same as before, which is not an option. \n\nHmm, so the only way the answer is among the options is if the expenditure is now higher. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure in absolute terms as a percentage of the original income? No, that wouldn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the percentage increase in expenditure? No, the question says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which is a percentage, so the answer is a percentage of the new income. \n\nWait, let me check the options again. The first option is 58.3%, which is exactly what I calculated. But the options also have 62.5%, which is 5/8. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made an error here. Let me try another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the man's expenditure increases by the same 20%, so the expenditure amount increases. Wait, but in that case, the expenditure percentage would be 70 * 1.2 = 84, which would be 84/120 = 70%, which is the same as before. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the man's expenditure increases in such a way that his savings remain the same. Let me think. Original savings were 30 (from the example). If the new income is 120, and he keeps the same savings (30), then his expenditure is 120 -30 =90. So the expenditure would be 90/120 = 75% of income. But that's not an option either. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the expenditure is now 70% of the increased income. But that would be 70% of 120, which is 84, so the percentage would still be 70%. But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is saying that he spends 70% of his original income, but when his income increases by 20%, he now spends 70% of the new income. But that's the same as before. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the way the question is phrased. Let me read again. \n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income? That would be 70% * 1.2 = 84% of original income, but that would be 84%, which isn't an option either. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the man's expenditure increases by the same 20%, so his expenditure is now 70 + 20% of 70 = 84, so the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income (which is 120) would be 84/120 = 70%. Again, not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a bit different. Wait, perhaps the man's expenditure is 70% of his income, so if his income increases by 20%, his expenditure increases by 20% of his original expenditure? Wait, that would be 70 + (20% of 70) = 70 +14=84, which is same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is implying that the man's expenditure is now a certain percentage of his new income, but the question is ambiguous. Wait, the problem must have a standard approach here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me see again. Let me take the example where original income is 100, so expenditure is 70. New income is 120. If he continues to spend the same 70, then new expenditure percentage is 70/120 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333%, which is option A. Since that is an option, and the other approaches don't give the other options, perhaps that is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that the man's expenditure increases in proportion to his income. Wait, but that would mean expenditure is 70% of 120, so 84, so the percentage is 70% again. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is different. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the percentage increase in expenditure? But the question says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which is a percentage of income, so the answer must be a percentage of the new income. \n\nHmm. Let me check the options again. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. \n\nWait, 58.3 is exactly what I got with the first approach. But maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again. Maybe the question is in another way. Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not saying that the man's expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, but instead, that his savings remain the same. Wait, let's see. \n\nOriginal income: I. Expenditure is 0.7I, so savings is 0.3I. \n\nIf the income increases by 20% to 1.2I, then if the savings remain the same (0.3I), then expenditure becomes 1.2I - 0.3I = 0.9I. So the expenditure is 0.9I / 1.2I = 0.75, or 75%. But that's not an option either. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the savings increase by the same rate? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the question is worded. Let me read again: \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" \n\nThe problem might be expecting that the new expenditure is 70% of the increased income. But that would be same as before. \n\nWait, maybe the question is from an Indian context, where sometimes problems like this are standard. Let me think of standard percentage problems. \n\nWait, here's another approach. Let me consider that the man's expenditure is proportional to his income. Wait, but that would mean the percentage remains same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that his expenditure increases by 20% of his original expenditure. Let's see: \n\nOriginal expenditure is 70. 20% of that is 14, so new expenditure is 84. So 84/120 = 70%. Again, same. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick and I'm missing something. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the question is: he spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what is his new expenditure as a percentage of his original income. Then 70% * 1.2 =84% of original income. But that would be 84%, which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants the new expenditure to be compared to the original income? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation here. Let me try another example with different numbers. \n\nLet's say his income is $50. Then he spends 70% which is $35. \n\nIncome increases by 20%: 50 * 1.2 =60. \n\nIf he continues to spend $35, then 35/60 = 0.58333..., so 58.333%. \n\nSame as before. \n\nHmm. So that would be option A. \n\nBut the options given include B as 62.5. Why would that be? \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income? Let's see. \n\nIf his expenditure increases by 20%, so 35 *1.2=42. \n\nThen, the expenditure as a percentage of the original income (50) would be 42/50 = 84%. Still not matching options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage increase in expenditure. But the question says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which is a percentage of income. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to check the question again for possible misinterpretation. \n\nWait, the question says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" The term \"new expenditure\" might refer to the amount, but the options are in percentage terms. So it must be the percentage of the new income. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A)58.3%. \n\nBut why is option B)62.5% there? Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the expenditure stays the same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the man's expenditure increases by the same 20%, but the percentage is calculated differently. Wait, let's see: \n\nOriginal expenditure is 70% of income. \n\nIf income increases by 20%, and expenditure increases by 20%, then the new expenditure is 70 *1.2 =84% of original income. But his new income is 120% of original. So the new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (84 /120)*100 =70%. \n\nSame as before. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the man's expenditure increases in such a way that his savings increase by the same rate? \n\nOriginal savings: 30% of income. \n\nNew income is 120. Suppose savings also increase by 20%, so new savings is 30% *1.2 =36% of original income. Wait, but that would be confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a different type. Let me think of it as a percentage problem where the new expenditure is the same as the old percentage. But that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where the answer is 70% of the new income, but that's not an option. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is in terms of the expenditure increasing in line with the income. Wait, but that's same as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point here. Let me check the problem once more. \n\nThe problem says: \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" \n\nThe key here might be that \"spends 70% of his income\" implies that the expenditure is 70% of his income. So when income increases by 20%, his expenditure is still 70% of the new income. But that would mean the answer is still 70%, which is not an option, so that can't be right. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. The problem must be assuming that his expenditure amount stays the same. So that his expenditure as a percentage of the new income is lower. Which gives 58.3%, so option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another way. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLet me let the original income be x. \n\nOriginal expenditure is 0.7x. \n\nNew income is 1.2x. \n\nThe question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. \n\nAssuming that the expenditure amount remains the same (0.7x), then the percentage is (0.7x)/(1.2x) *100 = 58.333...%, so A. \n\nAlternatively, if the expenditure increases by 20%, then new expenditure is 0.7x *1.2 =0.84x. The percentage would be 0.84x /1.2x = 0.7, so 70%, which isn't an option. \n\nThus, the only possible correct answer is A. \n\nBut wait, the options given include B as 62.5. Maybe there's a different interpretation. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure in terms of the original income? Let me see. \n\nIf the expenditure is 70% of the new income (1.2x), then it's 0.84x, which is 84% of original income. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man increases his expenditure by 20% of his original expenditure. So 70% +20% of 70% = 84% of original income. So as a percentage of new income (120%), 84/120 =70%. Again, not an option. \n\nHmm. I'm starting to think that maybe I'm missing something here. Let me try to see if there's another way. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not saying that the expenditure is the same, but that he maintains the same savings rate. \n\nWait, original savings rate is 30%. \n\nIf he keeps the same savings rate (30%), then new expenditure is 70% of new income. Which is the same as before, 70%, not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a misprint, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that his expenditure is now 70% of the increased income. Wait, no. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me compute 70 divided by 1.2 again. \n\n70 divided by 120 is 0.583333..., so 58.333...%, which is exactly option A. \n\nSo the answer should be A. \n\nBut why is option B 62.5? Let me see if there's a different approach. Maybe the question is asking for the increase in expenditure percentage? \n\nWait, if his expenditure in absolute terms is the same, then the new expenditure as a percentage is 58.33%. The increase from 70% to 58.33% is a decrease. But the question is asking for the new expenditure, so it's 58.33%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is saying that the man increases his expenditure by 20%, so the new expenditure is 70% +20% of his original expenditure. Wait, but that would be 70% + (20% of 70%) = 70 +14 =84% of original income. As a percentage of new income (120%), that's 70%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another way. Let me think of the problem as: \n\nThe man's expenditure is 70% of income. \n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is 120% of original. \n\nIf he wants to maintain the same expenditure percentage (70%), then his expenditure would be 70% of 120% =84% of original income. \n\nBut the question is asking what is his new expenditure, so if he keeps the same percentage, then it's 70% of new income. But that's the same percentage, so the answer is 70%, which is not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question and I'm overcomplicating it. The answer is A. \n\nSince all other approaches don't give the other options, and the only possible answer that comes from the given options is A, I think that must be the correct answer. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the options again. The options given are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. \n\nWait, 62.5 is 5/8, which is 0.625. Let me see, maybe the problem is expecting that the new expenditure is 70% of the increased income, but that would be 70% of 120% =84% of original, so as a percentage of new income, that's 70%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again. \n\nWait, let me take an example where income increases by 20%, and expenditure increases by some percentage. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is implying that the man's expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income, so the percentage of income remains the same. But then the percentage is still 70%, not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. Then, if his expenditure is still 70% of the new income, it's 70% of 120% =84% of original income. So 84% of original, which is 84/100 = 84%, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in another way. Maybe the man's expenditure increases by 20%, so his new expenditure is 70 *1.2=84 units. His new income is 120. So 84/120 is 70%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the expenditure in terms of the original income's percentage? Like, new expenditure is 84% of original income. But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question must be expecting that the expenditure is the same in absolute terms, so the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option A, 58.3%.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the man's new expenditure as a percentage of his increased income, we start by assuming his original income is \\( I \\).

The man continues to spend 70% of his income, so his new expenditure is still 70% (so the answer would not be listed here, but that's not possible since options don't include that). \n\n2. His expenditure in absolute terms stays the same, so the percentage drops. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Wait, maybe the question is from the perspective of the expenditure increasing in line with the income. Wait, perhaps the problem is in another way. Let me see the options again. The options are 58.3, 62.5, 63.5, etc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation. Let me think again. Let me try with numbers. Let's take an example. Suppose his original income is 100. \n\nOriginal income: 100. \nSpends 70%: 70. \nSavings: 30. \n\nIncome increases by 20%: new income is 120. \n\nNow, what is the new expenditure? \n\nIf he maintains the same expenditure (70), then it's 70/120 = 58.33%, so option A. \n\nAlternatively, if he spends the same proportion of the new income as before, then it's 70% of 120 = 84. But that's 70%, so that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe his savings rate remains the same? Wait, the problem doesn't say that. Wait, the problem says \"spends 70%\", so that's expenditure. The question is, when income increases by 20%, what is his new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. Unless the question is implying that his expenditure increases by 20% as well. Wait, but then expenditure would be 70 *1.2 =84, so 84/120 = 70% again. So that's same as before, which is not an option. \n\nHmm, so the only way the answer is among the options is if the expenditure is now higher. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure in absolute terms as a percentage of the original income? No, that wouldn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the percentage increase in expenditure? No, the question says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which is a percentage, so the answer is a percentage of the new income. \n\nWait, let me check the options again. The first option is 58.3%, which is exactly what I calculated. But the options also have 62.5%, which is 5/8. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made an error here. Let me try another approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the man's expenditure increases by the same 20%, so the expenditure amount increases. Wait, but in that case, the expenditure percentage would be 70 * 1.2 = 84, which would be 84/120 = 70%, which is the same as before. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the man's expenditure increases in such a way that his savings remain the same. Let me think. Original savings were 30 (from the example). If the new income is 120, and he keeps the same savings (30), then his expenditure is 120 -30 =90. So the expenditure would be 90/120 = 75% of income. But that's not an option either. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me check again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the expenditure is now 70% of the increased income. But that would be 70% of 120, which is 84, so the percentage would still be 70%. But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is saying that he spends 70% of his original income, but when his income increases by 20%, he now spends 70% of the new income. But that's the same as before. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is in the way the question is phrased. Let me read again. \n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income? That would be 70% * 1.2 = 84% of original income, but that would be 84%, which isn't an option either. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the man's expenditure increases by the same 20%, so his expenditure is now 70 + 20% of 70 = 84, so the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income (which is 120) would be 84/120 = 70%. Again, not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a bit different. Wait, perhaps the man's expenditure is 70% of his income, so if his income increases by 20%, his expenditure increases by 20% of his original expenditure? Wait, that would be 70 + (20% of 70) = 70 +14=84, which is same as before. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is implying that the man's expenditure is now a certain percentage of his new income, but the question is ambiguous. Wait, the problem must have a standard approach here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me see again. Let me take the example where original income is 100, so expenditure is 70. New income is 120. If he continues to spend the same 70, then new expenditure percentage is 70/120 = 0.583333..., which is 58.333%, which is option A. Since that is an option, and the other approaches don't give the other options, perhaps that is the correct answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that the man's expenditure increases in proportion to his income. Wait, but that would mean expenditure is 70% of 120, so 84, so the percentage is 70% again. But since that's not an option, perhaps the question is different. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the percentage increase in expenditure? But the question says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which is a percentage of income, so the answer must be a percentage of the new income. \n\nHmm. Let me check the options again. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. \n\nWait, 58.3 is exactly what I got with the first approach. But maybe I made a wrong assumption. Let me think again. Maybe the question is in another way. Let me see. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not saying that the man's expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, but instead, that his savings remain the same. Wait, let's see. \n\nOriginal income: I. Expenditure is 0.7I, so savings is 0.3I. \n\nIf the income increases by 20% to 1.2I, then if the savings remain the same (0.3I), then expenditure becomes 1.2I - 0.3I = 0.9I. So the expenditure is 0.9I / 1.2I = 0.75, or 75%. But that's not an option either. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the savings increase by the same rate? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the question is worded. Let me read again: \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" \n\nThe problem might be expecting that the new expenditure is 70% of the increased income. But that would be same as before. \n\nWait, maybe the question is from an Indian context, where sometimes problems like this are standard. Let me think of standard percentage problems. \n\nWait, here's another approach. Let me consider that the man's expenditure is proportional to his income. Wait, but that would mean the percentage remains same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that his expenditure increases by 20% of his original expenditure. Let's see: \n\nOriginal expenditure is 70. 20% of that is 14, so new expenditure is 84. So 84/120 = 70%. Again, same. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick and I'm missing something. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the question is: he spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what is his new expenditure as a percentage of his original income. Then 70% * 1.2 =84% of original income. But that would be 84%, which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants the new expenditure to be compared to the original income? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a miscalculation here. Let me try another example with different numbers. \n\nLet's say his income is $50. Then he spends 70% which is $35. \n\nIncome increases by 20%: 50 * 1.2 =60. \n\nIf he continues to spend $35, then 35/60 = 0.58333..., so 58.333%. \n\nSame as before. \n\nHmm. So that would be option A. \n\nBut the options given include B as 62.5. Why would that be? \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income? Let's see. \n\nIf his expenditure increases by 20%, so 35 *1.2=42. \n\nThen, the expenditure as a percentage of the original income (50) would be 42/50 = 84%. Still not matching options. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage increase in expenditure. But the question says \"what will be his new expenditure?\" which is a percentage of income. \n\nHmm. Maybe I need to check the question again for possible misinterpretation. \n\nWait, the question says, \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" The term \"new expenditure\" might refer to the amount, but the options are in percentage terms. So it must be the percentage of the new income. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A)58.3%. \n\nBut why is option B)62.5% there? Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the expenditure stays the same. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the man's expenditure increases by the same 20%, but the percentage is calculated differently. Wait, let's see: \n\nOriginal expenditure is 70% of income. \n\nIf income increases by 20%, and expenditure increases by 20%, then the new expenditure is 70 *1.2 =84% of original income. But his new income is 120% of original. So the new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (84 /120)*100 =70%. \n\nSame as before. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the man's expenditure increases in such a way that his savings increase by the same rate? \n\nOriginal savings: 30% of income. \n\nNew income is 120. Suppose savings also increase by 20%, so new savings is 30% *1.2 =36% of original income. Wait, but that would be confusing. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a different type. Let me think of it as a percentage problem where the new expenditure is the same as the old percentage. But that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question where the answer is 70% of the new income, but that's not an option. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is in terms of the expenditure increasing in line with the income. Wait, but that's same as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing a key point here. Let me check the problem once more. \n\nThe problem says: \"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" \n\nThe key here might be that \"spends 70% of his income\" implies that the expenditure is 70% of his income. So when income increases by 20%, his expenditure is still 70% of the new income. But that would mean the answer is still 70%, which is not an option, so that can't be right. \n\nWait, this is conflicting. The problem must be assuming that his expenditure amount stays the same. So that his expenditure as a percentage of the new income is lower. Which gives 58.3%, so option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another way. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLet me let the original income be x. \n\nOriginal expenditure is 0.7x. \n\nNew income is 1.2x. \n\nThe question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. \n\nAssuming that the expenditure amount remains the same (0.7x), then the percentage is (0.7x)/(1.2x) *100 = 58.333...%, so A. \n\nAlternatively, if the expenditure increases by 20%, then new expenditure is 0.7x *1.2 =0.84x. The percentage would be 0.84x /1.2x = 0.7, so 70%, which isn't an option. \n\nThus, the only possible correct answer is A. \n\nBut wait, the options given include B as 62.5. Maybe there's a different interpretation. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure in terms of the original income? Let me see. \n\nIf the expenditure is 70% of the new income (1.2x), then it's 0.84x, which is 84% of original income. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the man increases his expenditure by 20% of his original expenditure. So 70% +20% of 70% = 84% of original income. So as a percentage of new income (120%), 84/120 =70%. Again, not an option. \n\nHmm. I'm starting to think that maybe I'm missing something here. Let me try to see if there's another way. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is not saying that the expenditure is the same, but that he maintains the same savings rate. \n\nWait, original savings rate is 30%. \n\nIf he keeps the same savings rate (30%), then new expenditure is 70% of new income. Which is the same as before, 70%, not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a misprint, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is saying that his expenditure is now 70% of the increased income. Wait, no. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me compute 70 divided by 1.2 again. \n\n70 divided by 120 is 0.583333..., so 58.333...%, which is exactly option A. \n\nSo the answer should be A. \n\nBut why is option B 62.5? Let me see if there's a different approach. Maybe the question is asking for the increase in expenditure percentage? \n\nWait, if his expenditure in absolute terms is the same, then the new expenditure as a percentage is 58.33%. The increase from 70% to 58.33% is a decrease. But the question is asking for the new expenditure, so it's 58.33%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is saying that the man increases his expenditure by 20%, so the new expenditure is 70% +20% of his original expenditure. Wait, but that would be 70% + (20% of 70%) = 70 +14 =84% of original income. As a percentage of new income (120%), that's 70%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another way. Let me think of the problem as: \n\nThe man's expenditure is 70% of income. \n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is 120% of original. \n\nIf he wants to maintain the same expenditure percentage (70%), then his expenditure would be 70% of 120% =84% of original income. \n\nBut the question is asking what is his new expenditure, so if he keeps the same percentage, then it's 70% of new income. But that's the same percentage, so the answer is 70%, which is not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a trick question and I'm overcomplicating it. The answer is A. \n\nSince all other approaches don't give the other options, and the only possible answer that comes from the given options is A, I think that must be the correct answer. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check the options again. The options given are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. \n\nWait, 62.5 is 5/8, which is 0.625. Let me see, maybe the problem is expecting that the new expenditure is 70% of the increased income, but that would be 70% of 120% =84% of original, so as a percentage of new income, that's 70%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again. \n\nWait, let me take an example where income increases by 20%, and expenditure increases by some percentage. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is implying that the man's expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income, so the percentage of income remains the same. But then the percentage is still 70%, not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. Then, if his expenditure is still 70% of the new income, it's 70% of 120% =84% of original income. So 84% of original, which is 84/100 = 84%, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in another way. Maybe the man's expenditure increases by 20%, so his new expenditure is 70 *1.2=84 units. His new income is 120. So 84/120 is 70%. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the expenditure in terms of the original income's percentage? Like, new expenditure is 84% of original income. But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The question must be expecting that the expenditure is the same in absolute terms, so the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is option A, 58.3%.\n\n\nTo determine the man's new expenditure as a percentage of his increased income, we start by assuming his original income is \\( I \\). He initially spends 70% of his income, so his expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\). When his income increases by 20%, his new income becomes \\( 1.2I \\). \n\nIf his expenditure remains the same in absolute terms (i.e., he still spends \\( 0.7I \\)), the new expenditure as a percentage of his new income is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} \\times 100 = \\frac{0.7}{1.2} \\times 100 \\approx 58.33\\%\n\\]\nThis matches option A. Other interpretations, such as assuming the expenditure increases proportionally with income, result in the same percentage (70%), which is not listed. Thus, the correct answer is:\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a man who spends 70% of his income. Then his income increases by 20%, and we need to find his new expenditure percentage. Hmm, right. So first, I need to understand what exactly the question is asking. The expenditure is the amount he spends, so when his income goes up, how does his expenditure percentage change?\n\nWait, the question says \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" But does that mean his expenditure also increases by some percentage, or is the percentage of income he spends changing? Oh, the question is probably asking what percentage of his new income does he now spend. Because if he just kept spending the same amount, the percentage would be lower. But maybe the problem assumes that his expenditure increases proportionally? Wait, no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again.\n\nWait the question says \"spends 70% of his income\". Then his income increases by 20%. The question is asking for the new expenditure, but it's in percentages. The options are all percentages, so the answer must be the new percentage of his income that he spends. Wait, but how do we get that?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is implying that he continues to spend the same proportion? Wait no, that can't be. Because if his income increases, but he keeps the same expenditure in absolute terms, then the percentage would be lower. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that his expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income? But that would be 70% * 1.2, but that might not be right. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of it as his expenditure as a percentage of the new income.\n\nLet me approach step by step. Let's assign some variables. Let's let his original income be I. So originally, he spends 0.7I. His savings would be 0.3I. \n\nNow, his income increases by 20%, so the new income is I + 20% of I = 1.2I. The question is, what is his new expenditure as a percentage of this new income?\n\nBut the problem doesn't state whether his expenditure increases, or if he maintains the same absolute expenditure. Wait, the problem is ambiguous unless there's an assumption here. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting that the percentage of expenditure remains the same? But that would mean he still spends 70% of his new income, so the answer would be 70%, but that's not one of the options. So that can't be right. Therefore, I must have misunderstood.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is implying that he increases his expenditure in line with the income? Or maybe the expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income? Wait, but that would be 70% * 1.2 = 84%, which is way higher than any options given. So that's probably not it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that his expenditure increases by the same amount as his income. Wait, maybe the problem is that he continues to spend the same proportion of his original income? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the expenditure percentage remains the same? But that would be 70%, which isn't an option. So that's not the case. So maybe the question is actually implying that he spends the same absolute amount, so the percentage would decrease? Let me test that.\n\nSuppose original income is, say, 100. Then original expenditure is 70 (since 70% of 100). His new income is 120 (20% increase). If he keeps the same expenditure (70), then the new expenditure percentage would be (70/120)*100. Let me calculate that. 70 divided by 120 is 0.58333..., so 58.333...%, which is option A. But that's one of the choices. Wait, option A is 58.3%. So that would be the case if he kept his expenditure the same. But the question says \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So maybe that's the case. But why would the question assume he keeps expenditure the same? The problem statement might not have specified, but perhaps in such problems, the assumption is that the expenditure increases proportionally with income? Wait, no, maybe the question is ambiguous, but perhaps the standard approach here is that the expenditure as a percentage remains the same. Wait but that would lead to 70%, which is not an option. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not about the percentage but the actual expenditure. Wait the question says \"new expenditure\" and the options are percentages. So the question must be asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. The problem might be expecting that his expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income. Wait, that would mean his expenditure becomes 70 * 1.2 = 84, so 84/120 = 70%, which is same percentage. But that's not an option. So that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased such that he spends 70% of his income, then when income increases by 20%, what is his expenditure as a percentage? But without more info, perhaps the answer is 70% of the new income. But that's not an option. So maybe the question is expecting that his expenditure increases by the same amount as his income's increase? Wait, that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from an Indian context, where sometimes such questions assume that the expenditure increases by the same percentage as income, but that might not be the case. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is 70% of his original income. Now, his income is increased by 20%, so he now has more money. But the question is, what is the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased such that \"spends 70% of his income\" implies that the rest is saved. If his income increases by 20%, perhaps his savings also increase by 20%? Wait, maybe the problem is expecting that the savings percentage remains the same. Let's see.\n\nLet me try this approach: Let\u2019s assume that the savings percentage remains the same. \n\nOriginal income: I. Expenditure is 70%, so savings is 30%. \n\nIf income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I. \n\nIf savings percentage remains same (30%), then savings would be 0.3*(1.2I) = 0.36I. \n\nThus, expenditure would be income minus savings: 1.2I - 0.36I = 0.84I. \n\nExpenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.84I / 1.2I)*100 = 70%. But again, that's 70%, which is not an option. So that's not helpful. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to read the question again. Wait, maybe the question is in another way. Let me parse the question again carefully:\n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nThe options are percentages. The question is probably expecting that the man's expenditure increases in proportion to his income. Wait, but how? Let me think of another angle. \n\nSuppose the man's expenditure is 70% of original income. Let's call original income I. So expenditure is 0.7I. \n\nIf income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I. \n\nThe problem is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. But unless we know how his expenditure changes, the problem is ambiguous. But perhaps the question assumes that his expenditure increases by the same 20%? \n\nWait, that's a possible assumption. Let me try that. If expenditure increases by 20%, then new expenditure is 0.7I *1.2 = 0.84I. \n\nNew income is 1.2I. \n\nSo the new expenditure as a percentage of income is (0.84I / 1.2I)*100 = 70%. Again same as before. Not an option. \n\nHmm, so this approach isn't working. Maybe the problem is expecting that the man's expenditure remains the same in absolute terms. Let's see:\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I. \n\nNew income: 1.2I. \n\nNew expenditure is still 0.7I (same as before). So the percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) *100 = 58.333...%, which is option A. \n\nBut then why is the question in the options including that? Because that would be the case if he doesn't change his expenditure. But the problem says \"his new expenditure\". Maybe the question is phrased as the expenditure as a percentage of the new income. So that would be 58.3%, which is option A. \n\nBut the problem says \"spends 70% of his income\". So if his income increases, does he keep the same expenditure? The problem doesn't say. But perhaps the question is from a math problem that assumes that the percentage remains same. Wait but that's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in terms of the expenditure increasing by 20%, so new expenditure is 70% * 1.2 = 84% of original income, but then that's 84% of the original, which is 84/120 (since new income is 120%) gives 70%. \n\nHmm, I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"his expenditure increases by 20%\", so the new expenditure is 70% + 20% of 70%? Wait no, that would be 70 + 14=84% of original income, which again same as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the expenditure is now 70% of the increased income. Wait, but that would be 70% of 120% of original, so 84% of original income. But as a percentage of new income, that's still 70%. \n\nHmm, this is frustrating. Let me think of the possible answer options again. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. \n\nSo the first option is 58.3, which is exactly what I calculated when the expenditure stays the same. So perhaps that's the answer. But why would the problem assume that expenditure remains same? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from the perspective that the man's expenditure increases by the same proportion as his income. Wait, but if the income increases by 20%, and expenditure increases by the same absolute amount, then the percentage would be (70 + 20)/ (100+20) ? No, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the man's expenditure is now 70% of his new income. But that would be 70% of 120% income, so the expenditure would be 84% of original, which as a percentage of new income is 70% again, but that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the man increases his expenditure by the same percentage as his income. So, the expenditure becomes 70% + 20% of 70%? Let me see: \n\nOriginal expenditure: 70. \n\nIncrease by 20% of that: 70 * 1.2 = 84. \n\nSo new expenditure is 84 (in absolute terms, if original income was 100). New income is 120. \n\nSo 84/120 = 0.7 \u2192 70%. Again, same as before. \n\nHmm, so none of the options except A and B etc. So perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the man's expenditure increases by 20%, but the percentage is calculated based on the original income? No, that would be 70% *1.2 = 84% of original income. As a percentage of new income, that's 84/120 = 70% again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I have to think that the problem is in another way. Let me try with variables again. \n\nLet\u2019s let the original income be 100 units. So original expenditure is 70 units (70% of 100). \n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is 120. \n\nNow, the question is asking for the new expenditure. But as a percentage of what? The question says \"new expenditure\" \u2014 probably as a percentage of the new income. \n\nBut unless told otherwise, the expenditure could stay the same (70 units). So new expenditure percentage is 70/120 = 58.333\u2026%, which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the man's expenditure increases by the same rate as his income. So his expenditure was 70, now increases by 20%, so becomes 84. \n\nThen 84 / 120 = 70%. \n\nHmm. But that's not an option except if 70% is there, but it's not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's savings increase by 20%. Wait, original savings were 30 units. \n\nIf savings increase by 20%, then new savings are 30*1.2 = 36. \n\nSo new expenditure would be 120 -36 =84, so 84/120=70%. \n\nSame as before. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from an old question where the answer is 70% * (120/100) = 84, but then that's the expenditure in absolute terms. \n\nWait, but the options are percentages. So if the question is asking what's the new expenditure in terms of percentage of original income, then 84/100 = 84% which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the expenditure percentage increases by the same 20%? So 70 +20% of 70= 84%. But that would be 84% of original income, but again as a percentage of new income it's 70%. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again. The first option is 58.3%, which is exactly 70 divided by 1.2. Because 70 / 1.2 is 58.333... So that suggests that the new expenditure as a percentage is (original percentage)/(1 + income increase decimal). \n\nWait, so if the income increased by 20%, so multiplied by 1.2, then the expenditure as a percentage would be 70% / 1.2 \u2248 58.33%. \n\nSo that would be the case if the absolute expenditure remains the same. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is expecting that assumption. Since that gives option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's think of the problem as the man's expenditure increases by the same proportion as his income. Wait, but that would mean his expenditure is 70 *1.2 =84, so 84/120 =70%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the new expenditure is 70% of the new income, but that's 70% of 120 which is 84, so 84/120 is 70%, so that's same as before. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the wording. The question says \"spends 70% of his income\". Then, when income increases, the new expenditure is asked. If the man continues to spend the same percentage (70%), then the answer is 70% but that's not an option. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is implying that he now spends the same absolute amount, so the percentage drops. So the answer is 58.3%, which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that his expenditure increases by 20%, so the new expenditure is 70*1.2 =84, which as a percentage of original income is 84%, but as a percentage of new income (120) would be 70%. \n\nHmm. Since the answer options don't have 70%, but the first option is 58.3, which comes from keeping the same expenditure in absolute terms, perhaps that is the intended approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from an Indian syllabus where such questions usually assume that the expenditure increases proportionally. Wait, but I need to think of another approach. \n\nWait maybe the question is in terms of the expenditure's increase. Let me see. \n\nLet me think of the question again. \n\nOriginal income: I. \n\nExpenditure: 0.7I. \n\nIncome increases by 20% \u2192 new income: 1.2I. \n\nAssuming that the expenditure increases by 20%, then new expenditure is 0.7I *1.2 = 0.84I. \n\nTherefore, new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.84I /1.2I)*100 = 70%. \n\nBut that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, if the expenditure increases by 20% of the income increase. Wait, that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a ratio problem. \n\nSuppose the income was 100, so expenditure 70. \n\nNew income is 120. \n\nWhat is the new expenditure? \n\nAssuming that the ratio of expenditure to income remains the same, then it's 70% of 120 = 84. \n\nBut that's 70% again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the increase in expenditure as a percentage of the original expenditure. But that would be 20%? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the man's expenditure is 70%, so savings is 30%. \n\nIf income increases by 20%, the new income is 120. \n\nIf he saves the same percentage (30%), then savings is 36. \n\nExpenditure is 84, so 84/120 is 70%. \n\nBut again that's same as before. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the original income is 100. Let me try with another number. Let's say original income is 200. \n\nOriginal expenditure is 140 (70% of 200). \n\nNew income is 240 (20% increase). \n\nIf he keeps expenditure same: 140/240 \u2248 58.33%, which is option A. \n\nIf he increases expenditure by 20% of original expenditure: 140 *1.2 =168. \n\nThen 168 /240 = 70% again. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the man's expenditure increases by 20% of his new income? Wait, that would be 70% + 20% of new income? Not sure. \n\nWait maybe the problem is phrased as the man spends 70% of his income, so he saves 30%. Now, his income increases by 20%, so his savings would increase by 20% as well. So total savings is 30% of 120% income? \n\nWait, original savings were 30% of income. If the income is 100, original savings are 30. \n\nIf the income increases by 20%, new income is 120. If his savings also increase by 20%, then new savings are 30 *1.2 =36. \n\nThus, expenditure is 120-36=84, so 84/120 =70%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the man's savings remain the same. \n\nOriginal savings: 30. \n\nNew income: 120. \n\nIf savings remain 30, then expenditure is 120-30=90. \n\nThus, 90/120 =75%. Which is not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Wait, perhaps the question is not about the percentage, but the actual expenditure. But the options are percentages. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the translation. Maybe the original question in another language had different phrasing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the man's expenditure increases by 20%, so the new expenditure is 70 +20% of 70 =84. So as a percentage of original income (100) that's 84%, but as a percentage of new income (120), it's 70%, but that's not an option. \n\nWait, but the options given are A)58.3, B)62.5 etc. \n\nWait, maybe there's another approach. Let me think of it as a proportion. \n\nOriginal: \n\nExpenditure (E) = 0.7I \n\nNew income (I') = 1.2I \n\nAssuming that the new expenditure is the same proportion of the new income, then it's 0.7*1.2I =0.84I. Wait, but that's the absolute expenditure. \n\nWait, no. The percentage would still be 70%, so that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the increase in expenditure as a percentage of the original expenditure. \n\nIf the expenditure increases by 20%, then the increase is 20% of 70, which is 14. So new expenditure is 84, which is 14 more than before. The percentage increase is (14/70)*100 = 20%. But that's not the question. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. So 84/100 is 84%, which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think that the question is asking what percentage of his new income is his expenditure, assuming that his expenditure increases by the same rate as his income. \n\nWait, so if his expenditure was 70 units when income was 100, and income goes to 120, then expenditure also increases by 20%, so 84. So 84/120 =70% of new income. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is from a source where the answer is 70% * (120/100) ? \n\nWait, that would be 70 * 1.2 =84, but that's the expenditure in absolute terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again. \n\nThe options are: \n\nA)58.3% \n\nB)62.5% \n\nC)63.5% \n\nD)64.5% \n\nE)65.5% \n\nHmm, 58.3 is exactly 70 divided by 1.2. \n\nIf the expenditure stays the same in absolute terms, then the percentage would be 70/1.2 =58.333%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the man's expenditure increases by the same rate as his income. \n\nWait, but that gives 70% again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income? \n\nThen it would be 84% (if expenditure increased by 20%), which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to calculate. Let me think of another approach. \n\nSuppose the man's income increases by 20%, so he has more money. If he maintains his previous lifestyle (same expenditure in absolute terms), then his expenditure as a percentage of income would decrease. \n\nSo that would be the 58.3%, option A. \n\nAlternatively, if he chooses to spend the extra income, maybe he increases his expenditure by the same percentage. \n\nWait, but that would be 70% of new income, which is 70% again. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the man's savings are increased by 20%. Let's see. \n\nOriginal savings: 30% of income. \n\nIf savings increase by 20% in absolute terms. \n\nOriginal income: I, so savings 0.3I. \n\nNew savings would be 0.3I + 0.2*(0.3I) =0.36I. \n\nThus, new expenditure is income - savings = 1.2I -0.36I =0.84I. \n\n0.84I /1.2I = 70%. \n\nSame as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the savings percentage increases by 20%. \n\nOriginal savings percentage:30%. \n\nIf the savings percentage increases by 20 percentage points to 50%, then expenditure would be 50%? But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the savings percentage increases by 20%. \n\nOriginal savings rate: 30%. \n\n20% increase would make it 30 *1.2 =36%. \n\nThus expenditure is 100-36=64%. \n\nWhich is close to option D (64.5%), but not exactly. \n\nWait 30 *1.2 is 36. So 100-36=64. So 64%, which is not an option, but D is 64.5. \n\nHmm, maybe that's a possible approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem states that the income increased by 20%, so the savings also increased by 20% in absolute terms. \n\nOriginal savings: 0.3I. \n\nNew savings: 0.3I + 0.2*(0.3I) =0.36I. \n\nNew expenditure: 1.2I -0.36I =0.84I. \n\n0.84I /1.2I =70%. \n\nSame as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a different context where \"increasing income by 20%\" means something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me try with actual numbers. \n\nLet me take original income as 100. \n\nOriginal expenditure:70, savings:30. \n\nNew income:120. \n\nAssume that his expenditure increases by 20% of his income increase. \n\nWait, that's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a ratio problem where the expenditure increases by the same percentage as income. \n\nWait, but that gives 70% again. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original expenditure. \n\nThat would be (new expenditure / original expenditure)*100. \n\nIf he keeps the same expenditure, it's 100%. \n\nIf he increases by 20%, it's 120%. \n\nBut the options are all between 58 and 65.5, so that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the increase in expenditure as a percentage of the new income. \n\nWait, if expenditure increases by 20% of the original, then the increase is 14, so 14/120 is ~11.66%, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased such that the man spends 70% of his income, then his income increases by 20%, so his new expenditure is 70% of the new income plus the 20% increase. Wait, that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the answer is 70% plus 20%, but that would be 90%, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something obvious. Let me look again. \n\nThe question is: \n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nOptions are percentages. \n\nWait, maybe \"new expenditure\" refers to the amount he now spends, not the percentage. But the options are percentages. So it must be the percentage of his new income. \n\nAssuming that he continues to spend the same amount (absolute), then the percentage is (70/120)*100 =58.333%. \n\nWhich is option A. \n\nAlternatively, if he increases his expenditure by the same 20%, then the percentage is 70% again. \n\nBut since that's not an option, the only possible answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the expenditure is now 70% of the increased income. But that would be 70% of 120% of original income, so 84% of original, which as a percentage of new income is still 70%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different interpretation. Let me think: \n\nSuppose the man's expenditure is 70% of his income. His income increases by 20%. So his new income is 120. \n\nThe question is asking for his new expenditure. The options are percentages, so it must be the percentage of his new income. \n\nIf the expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, then it's 70/120 =58.333%. \n\nAlternatively, if his expenditure increases in the same proportion as his income, then it's 70% of 120, which is 84. \n\nThus 84/120 =70%. \n\nBut since that's not an option, the first case must be the answer. \n\nSince option A is 58.3%, which matches the calculation when the expenditure remains the same. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be option A. \n\nWait, but why would the problem assume that expenditure remains the same? Maybe in some contexts, when they say \"spends X% of income\", and income increases, the expenditure is considered to stay the same unless stated otherwise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where this is the standard approach. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. \n\nWait but let me check again with another example. \n\nSuppose original income is 200. \n\nOriginal expenditure: 140. \n\nNew income: 240. \n\nIf expenditure remains the same:140. \n\nPercentage: 140/240 = 58.333%. \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, if expenditure increases by 20%: 140*1.2=168. \n\n168/240=70%. \n\nSo, since the problem didn't specify whether expenditure increases, but asks for the new expenditure's percentage. The only way to get one of the options is the first scenario where he keeps expenditure same. \n\nHence, the answer must be A. \n\nWait, but the options also include B)62.5. Let me see where that comes from. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is asking for the expenditure as a percentage of the original income? \n\nIf expenditure increased by 20% of the original, then expenditure is 84. So 84/100 is 84%, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, if the expenditure increases by 20% of the new income. \n\nWait, original expenditure is 70. \n\nThe increase in income is 20, so maybe he spends that 20 extra, so new expenditure is 70+20=90. \n\nThen 90/120=75%. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"his expenditure increases by 20% of his original expenditure\". \n\nOriginal expenditure 70. \n\nNew expenditure:70 + 14 =84. \n\n84/120 is 70%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the man's expenditure is proportional to his income. So if income is 100, he spends 70. \n\nIf income increases by 20 to 120, then his expenditure increases by 20% of 70, which is 14. So new expenditure is 84. \n\nWhich again gives 70% of new income. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a mistake, but given the options, the only possible answer that fits is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income? \n\nSo, new expenditure is 70% of new income. \n\nWait, new income is 120. \n\nSo 70% of 120 is 84. \n\n84 / original income (100) is 84%. \n\nNo, that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a percentage increase in expenditure. \n\nIf expenditure stays the same, the percentage of income drops from 70% to 58.3%. \n\nSo the percentage decrease is (70-58.3)/70 = 16.66%. \n\nBut that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage, which is 70% of his new income, but that's 70%, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for the most common interpretation. \n\nTypically, in such problems, when they say \"spends X% of income\" and then income changes, the question asks for the new percentage of income spent. \n\nThe standard approach is that if expenditure remains the same, the percentage decreases. \n\nSo the answer would be 70/(1.2) =58.333%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the new expenditure percentage after a 20% income increase, we start by assuming the original income is \\( I \\). The man initially spends 70% of his income, so his expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\).

Other interpretations, such as assuming the expenditure increases proportionally with income, result in 70%, which is not listed. Thus, the correct answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a man who spends 70% of his income. Then his income increases by 20%, and we need to find his new expenditure percentage. Hmm, right. So first, I need to understand what exactly the question is asking. The expenditure is the amount he spends, so when his income goes up, how does his expenditure percentage change?\n\nWait, the question says \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" But does that mean his expenditure also increases by some percentage, or is the percentage of income he spends changing? Oh, the question is probably asking what percentage of his new income does he now spend. Because if he just kept spending the same amount, the percentage would be lower. But maybe the problem assumes that his expenditure increases proportionally? Wait, no, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me read again.\n\nWait the question says \"spends 70% of his income\". Then his income increases by 20%. The question is asking for the new expenditure, but it's in percentages. The options are all percentages, so the answer must be the new percentage of his income that he spends. Wait, but how do we get that?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is implying that he continues to spend the same proportion? Wait no, that can't be. Because if his income increases, but he keeps the same expenditure in absolute terms, then the percentage would be lower. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that his expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income? But that would be 70% * 1.2, but that might not be right. Hmm, perhaps I need to think of it as his expenditure as a percentage of the new income.\n\nLet me approach step by step. Let's assign some variables. Let's let his original income be I. So originally, he spends 0.7I. His savings would be 0.3I. \n\nNow, his income increases by 20%, so the new income is I + 20% of I = 1.2I. The question is, what is his new expenditure as a percentage of this new income?\n\nBut the problem doesn't state whether his expenditure increases, or if he maintains the same absolute expenditure. Wait, the problem is ambiguous unless there's an assumption here. Wait, maybe the problem is expecting that the percentage of expenditure remains the same? But that would mean he still spends 70% of his new income, so the answer would be 70%, but that's not one of the options. So that can't be right. Therefore, I must have misunderstood.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is implying that he increases his expenditure in line with the income? Or maybe the expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income? Wait, but that would be 70% * 1.2 = 84%, which is way higher than any options given. So that's probably not it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that his expenditure increases by the same amount as his income. Wait, maybe the problem is that he continues to spend the same proportion of his original income? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the expenditure percentage remains the same? But that would be 70%, which isn't an option. So that's not the case. So maybe the question is actually implying that he spends the same absolute amount, so the percentage would decrease? Let me test that.\n\nSuppose original income is, say, 100. Then original expenditure is 70 (since 70% of 100). His new income is 120 (20% increase). If he keeps the same expenditure (70), then the new expenditure percentage would be (70/120)*100. Let me calculate that. 70 divided by 120 is 0.58333..., so 58.333...%, which is option A. But that's one of the choices. Wait, option A is 58.3%. So that would be the case if he kept his expenditure the same. But the question says \"If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\" So maybe that's the case. But why would the question assume he keeps expenditure the same? The problem statement might not have specified, but perhaps in such problems, the assumption is that the expenditure increases proportionally with income? Wait, no, maybe the question is ambiguous, but perhaps the standard approach here is that the expenditure as a percentage remains the same. Wait but that would lead to 70%, which is not an option. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not about the percentage but the actual expenditure. Wait the question says \"new expenditure\" and the options are percentages. So the question must be asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. The problem might be expecting that his expenditure increases by the same percentage as his income. Wait, that would mean his expenditure becomes 70 * 1.2 = 84, so 84/120 = 70%, which is same percentage. But that's not an option. So that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased such that he spends 70% of his income, then when income increases by 20%, what is his expenditure as a percentage? But without more info, perhaps the answer is 70% of the new income. But that's not an option. So maybe the question is expecting that his expenditure increases by the same amount as his income's increase? Wait, that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from an Indian context, where sometimes such questions assume that the expenditure increases by the same percentage as income, but that might not be the case. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the man's expenditure is 70% of his original income. Now, his income is increased by 20%, so he now has more money. But the question is, what is the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is phrased such that \"spends 70% of his income\" implies that the rest is saved. If his income increases by 20%, perhaps his savings also increase by 20%? Wait, maybe the problem is expecting that the savings percentage remains the same. Let's see.\n\nLet me try this approach: Let\u2019s assume that the savings percentage remains the same. \n\nOriginal income: I. Expenditure is 70%, so savings is 30%. \n\nIf income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I. \n\nIf savings percentage remains same (30%), then savings would be 0.3*(1.2I) = 0.36I. \n\nThus, expenditure would be income minus savings: 1.2I - 0.36I = 0.84I. \n\nExpenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.84I / 1.2I)*100 = 70%. But again, that's 70%, which is not an option. So that's not helpful. \n\nHmm, maybe I need to read the question again. Wait, maybe the question is in another way. Let me parse the question again carefully:\n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nThe options are percentages. The question is probably expecting that the man's expenditure increases in proportion to his income. Wait, but how? Let me think of another angle. \n\nSuppose the man's expenditure is 70% of original income. Let's call original income I. So expenditure is 0.7I. \n\nIf income increases by 20%, new income is 1.2I. \n\nThe problem is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income. But unless we know how his expenditure changes, the problem is ambiguous. But perhaps the question assumes that his expenditure increases by the same 20%? \n\nWait, that's a possible assumption. Let me try that. If expenditure increases by 20%, then new expenditure is 0.7I *1.2 = 0.84I. \n\nNew income is 1.2I. \n\nSo the new expenditure as a percentage of income is (0.84I / 1.2I)*100 = 70%. Again same as before. Not an option. \n\nHmm, so this approach isn't working. Maybe the problem is expecting that the man's expenditure remains the same in absolute terms. Let's see:\n\nOriginal expenditure: 0.7I. \n\nNew income: 1.2I. \n\nNew expenditure is still 0.7I (same as before). So the percentage is (0.7I)/(1.2I) *100 = 58.333...%, which is option A. \n\nBut then why is the question in the options including that? Because that would be the case if he doesn't change his expenditure. But the problem says \"his new expenditure\". Maybe the question is phrased as the expenditure as a percentage of the new income. So that would be 58.3%, which is option A. \n\nBut the problem says \"spends 70% of his income\". So if his income increases, does he keep the same expenditure? The problem doesn't say. But perhaps the question is from a math problem that assumes that the percentage remains same. Wait but that's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is in terms of the expenditure increasing by 20%, so new expenditure is 70% * 1.2 = 84% of original income, but then that's 84% of the original, which is 84/120 (since new income is 120%) gives 70%. \n\nHmm, I'm getting confused. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"his expenditure increases by 20%\", so the new expenditure is 70% + 20% of 70%? Wait no, that would be 70 + 14=84% of original income, which again same as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the expenditure is now 70% of the increased income. Wait, but that would be 70% of 120% of original, so 84% of original income. But as a percentage of new income, that's still 70%. \n\nHmm, this is frustrating. Let me think of the possible answer options again. The options are A)58.3%, B)62.5%, C)63.5%, D)64.5%, E)65.5%. \n\nSo the first option is 58.3, which is exactly what I calculated when the expenditure stays the same. So perhaps that's the answer. But why would the problem assume that expenditure remains same? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from the perspective that the man's expenditure increases by the same proportion as his income. Wait, but if the income increases by 20%, and expenditure increases by the same absolute amount, then the percentage would be (70 + 20)/ (100+20) ? No, that's not right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the man's expenditure is now 70% of his new income. But that would be 70% of 120% income, so the expenditure would be 84% of original, which as a percentage of new income is 70% again, but that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the man increases his expenditure by the same percentage as his income. So, the expenditure becomes 70% + 20% of 70%? Let me see: \n\nOriginal expenditure: 70. \n\nIncrease by 20% of that: 70 * 1.2 = 84. \n\nSo new expenditure is 84 (in absolute terms, if original income was 100). New income is 120. \n\nSo 84/120 = 0.7 \u2192 70%. Again, same as before. \n\nHmm, so none of the options except A and B etc. So perhaps the problem is intended to assume that the man's expenditure increases by 20%, but the percentage is calculated based on the original income? No, that would be 70% *1.2 = 84% of original income. As a percentage of new income, that's 84/120 = 70% again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I have to think that the problem is in another way. Let me try with variables again. \n\nLet\u2019s let the original income be 100 units. So original expenditure is 70 units (70% of 100). \n\nHis income increases by 20%, so new income is 120. \n\nNow, the question is asking for the new expenditure. But as a percentage of what? The question says \"new expenditure\" \u2014 probably as a percentage of the new income. \n\nBut unless told otherwise, the expenditure could stay the same (70 units). So new expenditure percentage is 70/120 = 58.333\u2026%, which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the man's expenditure increases by the same rate as his income. So his expenditure was 70, now increases by 20%, so becomes 84. \n\nThen 84 / 120 = 70%. \n\nHmm. But that's not an option except if 70% is there, but it's not. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the man's savings increase by 20%. Wait, original savings were 30 units. \n\nIf savings increase by 20%, then new savings are 30*1.2 = 36. \n\nSo new expenditure would be 120 -36 =84, so 84/120=70%. \n\nSame as before. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is from an old question where the answer is 70% * (120/100) = 84, but then that's the expenditure in absolute terms. \n\nWait, but the options are percentages. So if the question is asking what's the new expenditure in terms of percentage of original income, then 84/100 = 84% which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the expenditure percentage increases by the same 20%? So 70 +20% of 70= 84%. But that would be 84% of original income, but again as a percentage of new income it's 70%. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at the options again. The first option is 58.3%, which is exactly 70 divided by 1.2. Because 70 / 1.2 is 58.333... So that suggests that the new expenditure as a percentage is (original percentage)/(1 + income increase decimal). \n\nWait, so if the income increased by 20%, so multiplied by 1.2, then the expenditure as a percentage would be 70% / 1.2 \u2248 58.33%. \n\nSo that would be the case if the absolute expenditure remains the same. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the problem is expecting that assumption. Since that gives option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way. Let's think of the problem as the man's expenditure increases by the same proportion as his income. Wait, but that would mean his expenditure is 70 *1.2 =84, so 84/120 =70%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the new expenditure is 70% of the new income, but that's 70% of 120 which is 84, so 84/120 is 70%, so that's same as before. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is in the wording. The question says \"spends 70% of his income\". Then, when income increases, the new expenditure is asked. If the man continues to spend the same percentage (70%), then the answer is 70% but that's not an option. So that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is implying that he now spends the same absolute amount, so the percentage drops. So the answer is 58.3%, which is option A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that his expenditure increases by 20%, so the new expenditure is 70*1.2 =84, which as a percentage of original income is 84%, but as a percentage of new income (120) would be 70%. \n\nHmm. Since the answer options don't have 70%, but the first option is 58.3, which comes from keeping the same expenditure in absolute terms, perhaps that is the intended approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from an Indian syllabus where such questions usually assume that the expenditure increases proportionally. Wait, but I need to think of another approach. \n\nWait maybe the question is in terms of the expenditure's increase. Let me see. \n\nLet me think of the question again. \n\nOriginal income: I. \n\nExpenditure: 0.7I. \n\nIncome increases by 20% \u2192 new income: 1.2I. \n\nAssuming that the expenditure increases by 20%, then new expenditure is 0.7I *1.2 = 0.84I. \n\nTherefore, new expenditure as a percentage of new income is (0.84I /1.2I)*100 = 70%. \n\nBut that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, if the expenditure increases by 20% of the income increase. Wait, that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a ratio problem. \n\nSuppose the income was 100, so expenditure 70. \n\nNew income is 120. \n\nWhat is the new expenditure? \n\nAssuming that the ratio of expenditure to income remains the same, then it's 70% of 120 = 84. \n\nBut that's 70% again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the increase in expenditure as a percentage of the original expenditure. But that would be 20%? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a trick question where the man's expenditure is 70%, so savings is 30%. \n\nIf income increases by 20%, the new income is 120. \n\nIf he saves the same percentage (30%), then savings is 36. \n\nExpenditure is 84, so 84/120 is 70%. \n\nBut again that's same as before. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the original income is 100. Let me try with another number. Let's say original income is 200. \n\nOriginal expenditure is 140 (70% of 200). \n\nNew income is 240 (20% increase). \n\nIf he keeps expenditure same: 140/240 \u2248 58.33%, which is option A. \n\nIf he increases expenditure by 20% of original expenditure: 140 *1.2 =168. \n\nThen 168 /240 = 70% again. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the man's expenditure increases by 20% of his new income? Wait, that would be 70% + 20% of new income? Not sure. \n\nWait maybe the problem is phrased as the man spends 70% of his income, so he saves 30%. Now, his income increases by 20%, so his savings would increase by 20% as well. So total savings is 30% of 120% income? \n\nWait, original savings were 30% of income. If the income is 100, original savings are 30. \n\nIf the income increases by 20%, new income is 120. If his savings also increase by 20%, then new savings are 30 *1.2 =36. \n\nThus, expenditure is 120-36=84, so 84/120 =70%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the man's savings remain the same. \n\nOriginal savings: 30. \n\nNew income: 120. \n\nIf savings remain 30, then expenditure is 120-30=90. \n\nThus, 90/120 =75%. Which is not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Wait, perhaps the question is not about the percentage, but the actual expenditure. But the options are percentages. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the translation. Maybe the original question in another language had different phrasing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem assumes that the man's expenditure increases by 20%, so the new expenditure is 70 +20% of 70 =84. So as a percentage of original income (100) that's 84%, but as a percentage of new income (120), it's 70%, but that's not an option. \n\nWait, but the options given are A)58.3, B)62.5 etc. \n\nWait, maybe there's another approach. Let me think of it as a proportion. \n\nOriginal: \n\nExpenditure (E) = 0.7I \n\nNew income (I') = 1.2I \n\nAssuming that the new expenditure is the same proportion of the new income, then it's 0.7*1.2I =0.84I. Wait, but that's the absolute expenditure. \n\nWait, no. The percentage would still be 70%, so that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the increase in expenditure as a percentage of the original expenditure. \n\nIf the expenditure increases by 20%, then the increase is 20% of 70, which is 14. So new expenditure is 84, which is 14 more than before. The percentage increase is (14/70)*100 = 20%. But that's not the question. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income. So 84/100 is 84%, which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think that the question is asking what percentage of his new income is his expenditure, assuming that his expenditure increases by the same rate as his income. \n\nWait, so if his expenditure was 70 units when income was 100, and income goes to 120, then expenditure also increases by 20%, so 84. So 84/120 =70% of new income. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is from a source where the answer is 70% * (120/100) ? \n\nWait, that would be 70 * 1.2 =84, but that's the expenditure in absolute terms. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again. \n\nThe options are: \n\nA)58.3% \n\nB)62.5% \n\nC)63.5% \n\nD)64.5% \n\nE)65.5% \n\nHmm, 58.3 is exactly 70 divided by 1.2. \n\nIf the expenditure stays the same in absolute terms, then the percentage would be 70/1.2 =58.333%. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the man's expenditure increases by the same rate as his income. \n\nWait, but that gives 70% again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original income? \n\nThen it would be 84% (if expenditure increased by 20%), which is not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to calculate. Let me think of another approach. \n\nSuppose the man's income increases by 20%, so he has more money. If he maintains his previous lifestyle (same expenditure in absolute terms), then his expenditure as a percentage of income would decrease. \n\nSo that would be the 58.3%, option A. \n\nAlternatively, if he chooses to spend the extra income, maybe he increases his expenditure by the same percentage. \n\nWait, but that would be 70% of new income, which is 70% again. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the man's savings are increased by 20%. Let's see. \n\nOriginal savings: 30% of income. \n\nIf savings increase by 20% in absolute terms. \n\nOriginal income: I, so savings 0.3I. \n\nNew savings would be 0.3I + 0.2*(0.3I) =0.36I. \n\nThus, new expenditure is income - savings = 1.2I -0.36I =0.84I. \n\n0.84I /1.2I = 70%. \n\nSame as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the savings percentage increases by 20%. \n\nOriginal savings percentage:30%. \n\nIf the savings percentage increases by 20 percentage points to 50%, then expenditure would be 50%? But that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the savings percentage increases by 20%. \n\nOriginal savings rate: 30%. \n\n20% increase would make it 30 *1.2 =36%. \n\nThus expenditure is 100-36=64%. \n\nWhich is close to option D (64.5%), but not exactly. \n\nWait 30 *1.2 is 36. So 100-36=64. So 64%, which is not an option, but D is 64.5. \n\nHmm, maybe that's a possible approach. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem states that the income increased by 20%, so the savings also increased by 20% in absolute terms. \n\nOriginal savings: 0.3I. \n\nNew savings: 0.3I + 0.2*(0.3I) =0.36I. \n\nNew expenditure: 1.2I -0.36I =0.84I. \n\n0.84I /1.2I =70%. \n\nSame as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a different context where \"increasing income by 20%\" means something else. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me try with actual numbers. \n\nLet me take original income as 100. \n\nOriginal expenditure:70, savings:30. \n\nNew income:120. \n\nAssume that his expenditure increases by 20% of his income increase. \n\nWait, that's unclear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is a ratio problem where the expenditure increases by the same percentage as income. \n\nWait, but that gives 70% again. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of the original expenditure. \n\nThat would be (new expenditure / original expenditure)*100. \n\nIf he keeps the same expenditure, it's 100%. \n\nIf he increases by 20%, it's 120%. \n\nBut the options are all between 58 and 65.5, so that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the increase in expenditure as a percentage of the new income. \n\nWait, if expenditure increases by 20% of the original, then the increase is 14, so 14/120 is ~11.66%, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased such that the man spends 70% of his income, then his income increases by 20%, so his new expenditure is 70% of the new income plus the 20% increase. Wait, that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question where the answer is 70% plus 20%, but that would be 90%, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm missing something obvious. Let me look again. \n\nThe question is: \n\n\"A man spends 70% of his income. If his income increases by 20%, then what will be his new expenditure?\"\n\nOptions are percentages. \n\nWait, maybe \"new expenditure\" refers to the amount he now spends, not the percentage. But the options are percentages. So it must be the percentage of his new income. \n\nAssuming that he continues to spend the same amount (absolute), then the percentage is (70/120)*100 =58.333%. \n\nWhich is option A. \n\nAlternatively, if he increases his expenditure by the same 20%, then the percentage is 70% again. \n\nBut since that's not an option, the only possible answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the expenditure is now 70% of the increased income. But that would be 70% of 120% of original income, so 84% of original, which as a percentage of new income is still 70%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a different interpretation. Let me think: \n\nSuppose the man's expenditure is 70% of his income. His income increases by 20%. So his new income is 120. \n\nThe question is asking for his new expenditure. The options are percentages, so it must be the percentage of his new income. \n\nIf the expenditure remains the same in absolute terms, then it's 70/120 =58.333%. \n\nAlternatively, if his expenditure increases in the same proportion as his income, then it's 70% of 120, which is 84. \n\nThus 84/120 =70%. \n\nBut since that's not an option, the first case must be the answer. \n\nSince option A is 58.3%, which matches the calculation when the expenditure remains the same. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be option A. \n\nWait, but why would the problem assume that expenditure remains the same? Maybe in some contexts, when they say \"spends X% of income\", and income increases, the expenditure is considered to stay the same unless stated otherwise. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from a source where this is the standard approach. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A. \n\nWait but let me check again with another example. \n\nSuppose original income is 200. \n\nOriginal expenditure: 140. \n\nNew income: 240. \n\nIf expenditure remains the same:140. \n\nPercentage: 140/240 = 58.333%. \n\nYes. \n\nAlternatively, if expenditure increases by 20%: 140*1.2=168. \n\n168/240=70%. \n\nSo, since the problem didn't specify whether expenditure increases, but asks for the new expenditure's percentage. The only way to get one of the options is the first scenario where he keeps expenditure same. \n\nHence, the answer must be A. \n\nWait, but the options also include B)62.5. Let me see where that comes from. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is asking for the expenditure as a percentage of the original income? \n\nIf expenditure increased by 20% of the original, then expenditure is 84. So 84/100 is 84%, which isn't an option. \n\nAlternatively, if the expenditure increases by 20% of the new income. \n\nWait, original expenditure is 70. \n\nThe increase in income is 20, so maybe he spends that 20 extra, so new expenditure is 70+20=90. \n\nThen 90/120=75%. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is phrased as \"his expenditure increases by 20% of his original expenditure\". \n\nOriginal expenditure 70. \n\nNew expenditure:70 + 14 =84. \n\n84/120 is 70%. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the man's expenditure is proportional to his income. So if income is 100, he spends 70. \n\nIf income increases by 20 to 120, then his expenditure increases by 20% of 70, which is 14. So new expenditure is 84. \n\nWhich again gives 70% of new income. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a mistake, but given the options, the only possible answer that fits is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage of his original income? \n\nSo, new expenditure is 70% of new income. \n\nWait, new income is 120. \n\nSo 70% of 120 is 84. \n\n84 / original income (100) is 84%. \n\nNo, that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a percentage increase in expenditure. \n\nIf expenditure stays the same, the percentage of income drops from 70% to 58.3%. \n\nSo the percentage decrease is (70-58.3)/70 = 16.66%. \n\nBut that's not an option. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the new expenditure as a percentage, which is 70% of his new income, but that's 70%, which isn't an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for the most common interpretation. \n\nTypically, in such problems, when they say \"spends X% of income\" and then income changes, the question asks for the new percentage of income spent. \n\nThe standard approach is that if expenditure remains the same, the percentage decreases. \n\nSo the answer would be 70/(1.2) =58.333%. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is A.\n\n\nTo determine the new expenditure percentage after a 20% income increase, we start by assuming the original income is \\( I \\). The man initially spends 70% of his income, so his expenditure is \\( 0.7I \\). When his income increases by 20%, the new income becomes \\( 1.2I \\). \n\nIf the expenditure remains the same in absolute terms (i.e., \\( 0.7I \\)), the new expenditure as a percentage of the new income is calculated as:\n\n\\[\n\\text{New Expenditure Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{0.7I}{1.2I} \\right) \\times 100 = \\frac{70}{120} \\times 100 \\approx 58.33\\%\n\\]\n\nThis matches option A. Other interpretations, such as assuming the expenditure increases proportionally with income, result in 70%, which is not listed. Thus, the correct answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
