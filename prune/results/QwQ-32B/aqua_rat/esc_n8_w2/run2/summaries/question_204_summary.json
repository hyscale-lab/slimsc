      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is asking for 60% of 30% of 1400 grams. Hmm, right. So first, I need to figure out what 30% of 1400 is, and then take 60% of that result. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst step: Calculate 30% of 1400 grams. To find a percentage of a number, I remember that percentage means per hundred. So 30% is the same as 0.30 in decimal form. So multiplying 1400 by 0.30 should give me that part. Let me do that: 1400 * 0.30. Let's see, 1400 times 0.3. Well, 1400 times 0.1 is 140, so 0.3 would be three times that, which is 420. So 30% of 1400 is 420 grams. Got that part.\n\nNow the next part is 60% of that result. So take the 420 grams and find 60% of it. Again converting percentage to decimal, 60% is 0.60. So 420 multiplied by 0.60. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 400 * 0.6 is 240, and 20 * 0.6 is 12. Adding those together, 240 +12 = 252. So 60% of 420 is 252 grams. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 252 gms. Wait, but let me double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nFirst calculation: 30% of 1400. 0.3 * 1400. 1400 divided by 10 is 140, times 3 gives 420. That's correct. Then 60% of 420. 0.6 *420. Let me do it another way. 420 divided by 10 is 42, so 10% is 42, so 60% is 6 times 42. 42*6: 40*6=240 and 2*6=12, so 252. Yep, that matches. \n\nSo the answer should be C)252 gms. Let me check the options again. Option C is indeed 252. So I think that's the right choice. Wait, but the options have E) None of these. But since C is correct, E isn't needed. So the answer is C.\n",
