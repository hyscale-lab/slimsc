      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about an organization trying to raise money from employees. They want to get 6 lakh rupees by having each employee contribute the same amount. Then, if each gave 60 rupees more, the total would be 6.24 lakh. We need to find out how many employees there are. Hmm, right.\n\nSo, let's break it down. Let me denote the number of employees as N. And let the original contribution per person be x rupees. Then, according to the first part, the total is N times x equals 6 lakh. So equation one is N * x = 600,000. Because 1 lakh is 100,000, right? So 6 lakh is 600,000.\n\nNow, the second scenario says if each contributed 60 more, the total becomes 6.24 lakh. So that would be N times (x + 60) equals 624,000. Because 6.24 lakh is 624,000. So the second equation is N*(x +60) = 624,000.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\n1) Nx = 600,000\n\n2) N(x +60) = 624,000\n\nI can subtract the first equation from the second maybe? Let's see. Let me expand the second equation: Nx + 60N = 624,000. Then subtract the first equation (Nx = 600,000) from that. So:\n\nNx +60N - Nx = 624,000 - 600,000\n\nWhich simplifies to 60N = 24,000.\n\nWait, 624,000 minus 600,000 is 24,000. So 60N =24,000. Then solving for N would be 24,000 divided by 60. Let me calculate that: 24,000 /60 is 400. Because 60 times 400 is 24,000. So N is 400? Let me check the options. Option C is 400, so that's the answer?\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. Let's plug back in. Let's see, if there are 400 employees, then original contribution per person is 600,000 divided by 400. 600,000 /400 is 1500. So each gives 1500. Then if they give 60 more, that's 1560. 400 *1560 = ?\n\nCalculating 400 *1500 is 600,000, plus 400*60 is 24,000. So total is 624,000, which matches the second total. Yep, that works. So the answer must be C)400.\n",

The question is asking how many employees there are. The second part says that if each contributed 60 rupees more, the total would have been 6.24 lakh. Hmm, let's think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. The original plan is to collect 6 lakh total, with each employee giving the same amount. Let me call the number of employees 'n' and the original contribution per person 'x'. So, the first equation would be n * x = 600,000 (since 1 lakh is 100,000, right? So 6 lakh is 600,000). \n\nThen, if each contributes 60 more, the total becomes 6.24 lakh. So that's 624,000. So the second scenario would be n * (x + 60) = 624,000. \n\nSo now I have two equations:\n\n1. n*x = 600,000\n2. n*(x + 60) = 624,000\n\nI need to solve for n. Let me see. Maybe subtract the first equation from the second? Let's see:\n\nThe second equation can be written as n*x + n*60 = 624,000. \n\nBut from the first equation, n*x is 600,000. So substituting that into the second equation gives 600,000 + 60n = 624,000. \n\nOh, right! That's a good approach. So subtract 600,000 from both sides:\n\n60n = 624,000 - 600,000 = 24,000.\n\nSo 60n = 24,000 \u2192 n = 24,000 / 60.\n\nLet me calculate that: 24,000 divided by 60. 24,000 divided by 60 is the same as 2400 divided by 6, which is 400. Wait, 60 times 400 is 24,000. Yeah, that's correct. So n would be 400?\n\nWait, but let me check the options. The options are 300, 200, 400, 100, 500. So 400 is option C. Hmm, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me verify with the original equations. If there are 400 employees, then the original contribution per person would be 600,000 / 400 = 1,500 rupees each. Then, if each gives 60 more, that's 1,560. Multiply by 400 employees: 1560 * 400. Let me compute that. 1500 * 400 = 600,000, plus 60*400=24,000, totaling 624,000. Which matches the second condition. So yes, that works. \n\nSo the answer should be C)400. But wait, let me check another way in case I messed up the algebra.\n\nAlternative approach: Let the number of employees be n. The difference in total amount is 6.24 lakh minus 6 lakh, which is 0.24 lakh, so 24,000. This difference is due to each employee contributing an extra 60. So the total extra is 60 * n = 24,000. So n=24,000 /60 = 400. Yep, same result. So that's correct. So the answer is C.\n",
