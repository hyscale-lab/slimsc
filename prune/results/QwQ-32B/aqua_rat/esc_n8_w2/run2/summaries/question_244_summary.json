      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem says that m is greater than 0, y is also greater than 0, and x is m percent of 4y. Then we need to find what percentage m is of x, in terms of y. Hmm, percentages can sometimes trip me up, but let's take it step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the given information. The question states that x is m percent of 4y. So, translating that into math. Remember that \"percent\" means per hundred, so m percent is m/100. So, x equals (m/100) times 4y. Let me write that down:\n\nx = (m/100) * 4y.\n\nSimplify that equation. 4y times m over 100. Let me rearrange that. So x = (4y * m)/100. Maybe I can simplify that fraction. 4 divided by 100 is 1/25, so that becomes (y * m)/25. Wait, no, 4/100 is 1/25, so yes. So x = (m*y)/25. Wait, no, hold on. Let me check again. 4 divided by 100 is 0.04, but maybe better to keep it as fractions. Let me see:\n\nx = (4y * m)/100 \u2192 that can be written as (4m y)/100. Simplify numerator and denominator by dividing numerator and denominator by 4: (m y)/25. So yes, x = (m y)/25. Alternatively, maybe I should keep the original equation as is for now.\n\nThe question is asking: m is what percentage of x? So, in other words, we need to find (m / x) * 100%, right? Because when they ask \"A is what percentage of B\", the formula is (A/B)*100. So here, A is m, B is x. So the percentage is (m/x)*100. But the problem says to express this in terms of y. So we need to find (m/x)*100 in terms of y.\n\nBut since x is given in terms of m and y, maybe we can express m in terms of x and y first, then plug into the percentage?\n\nAlternatively, let's see. Let me write down the variables involved. Let me see:\n\nWe have x = (m/100)*4y. So from that equation, perhaps we can solve for m in terms of x and y. Let's do that.\n\nStarting with x = (m *4y)/100.\n\nMultiply both sides by 100: 100x = 4y m.\n\nThen, solving for m: m = (100x)/(4y) \u2192 m = (25x)/y.\n\nSo m = (25x)/y. Now the question is, m is what percentage of x? So, m is (25x/y) divided by x, multiplied by 100. Let me compute that.\n\nPercentage = (m / x) * 100 = [(25x/y)/x] * 100. The x cancels out here. So that becomes (25/y)*100 = (25*100)/y = 2500/y. Wait, so that would be 2500 divided by y percent. Hmm, looking at the options, option D is 2500/y. So that's one of the choices. Let me check again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait, let's go through the steps again. \n\nOriginal equation: x is m% of 4y. So x = (m/100)*4y. So solving for m: m = (x * 100)/(4y) \u2192 m = (100x)/(4y) = 25x/y. \n\nThen, m is what percentage of x? So the percentage is (m/x)*100. Plugging in m: ( (25x/y)/x ) *100 \u2192 25/y *100 = 2500/y. So yes, that's D. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)y/400\n\nB)4y\n\nC)50y\n\nD)2500/y\n\nE)5000/y\n\nSo D is exactly what I got. Hmm. Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't reverse anything. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the setup. Let me try another approach. \n\nSuppose I need to find the percentage P such that m = P% of x. So, m = (P/100)*x. Solving for P gives P = (m/x)*100. Which is exactly what I did before. So that's correct. \n\nSo substituting m from the first equation into this. Wait, but maybe I should express everything in terms of variables. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way. Let me assign some numbers to m and y to see if this works. Let's pick numbers where the answer is clear. \n\nLet me choose y = 25. Then, if the answer is D (2500/y), then when y is 25, the percentage should be 2500/25=100. So m would be 100% of x. Let me see if that holds. \n\nLet me set y =25. Let me pick m such that x is m% of 4y. Let me choose m as, say, 10. Then x would be (10/100)*4*25. So 10% of 100 (since 4*25 is 100) so x would be 10. \n\nNow, m is 10, x is 10. So m is 100% of x. Which matches 2500/y (since y=25, 2500/25=100). So that works. \n\nLet me try another example. Let's choose y=10. Then according to D, the answer would be 2500/10=250. So m should be 250% of x. Let me see. \n\nLet me pick m=50. Then x is (50/100)*4*10 = (0.5)*40=20. \n\nSo m is 50, x is 20. So m/x is 50/20 = 2.5, which is 250%. Which is exactly 2500/y (2500/10=250). That works. \n\nAlternatively, let me try y=50. Then the answer would be 2500/50=50. So m should be 50% of x. Let's test that. \n\nSuppose m=10 again. Then x is (10/100)*4*50 = 0.1 *200 =20. So m is 10, x is 20. 10 is 50% of 20. Which matches. \n\nHmm, so the examples are working. That suggests D is correct. \n\nWait, but let me check another approach. Let me see if the answer could be E. Wait, 5000/y. Let me see. Suppose y is 50, then 5000/50=100. But in the example above, when y=50, the answer was 50%, so that's not matching. So E would be wrong there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my first calculation. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the steps when solving for m. Let me re-express the equations again. \n\nOriginal equation: x = (m percent of 4y). \n\nSo, \"m percent\" is m/100. So x = (m/100)*(4y). \n\nSo x = (4y m)/100. \n\nWe can rearrange this equation to solve for m: multiply both sides by 100:\n\n100x =4y m \u2192 m = (100x)/(4y) \u2192 m = (25x)/y. \n\nSo then, when we need to find m as a percentage of x, that's (m/x)*100. \n\nPlugging in m =25x/y gives (25x/y)/x *100 \u2192 (25/y)*100 \u2192 2500/y. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nHmm. So the answer must be D. \n\nAlternatively, let me check option E. Suppose someone thought that x is m percent of 4y, so perhaps they set up the equation as x = (4y) * (m/100), which is same as what I did, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the percentage calculation. Let me think: the question says \"m is what percentage of x?\" So the formula is (m/x)*100. So if m is 25x/y, then that fraction is (25x/y)/x \u2192 25/y, then times 100 gives 2500/y. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is D.\n",

But they want the answer expressed in terms of y. \n\nThe given information is that x is m percent of 4y. Let me write that down. \n\nSo, x equals m percent of 4y. To translate percentages into equations, remember that \"percent\" means per hundred. So m percent would be m/100. So, x = (m/100) * 4y. \n\nWait, let me confirm that: if x is m% of 4y, then x = (m/100)*4y. Yeah, that makes sense. So that equation is x = (4y * m)/100.\n\nThe question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So, the formula for that would be (m / x) * 100. Because percentage of x is (part/whole)*100, here the part is m and the whole is x. So we need to compute (m/x)*100, and express that in terms of y.\n\nBut to do that, I need to express m in terms of x and y, or find a way to substitute variables so that m/x can be written using y. Let's see.\n\nStarting with the equation x = (4y * m)/100. Let me rearrange this equation to solve for m in terms of x and y. \n\nMultiply both sides by 100: 100x = 4y * m. Then, divide both sides by 4y: m = (100x)/(4y). Simplify that, m = (25x)/y. \n\nWait, so m = (25x)/y. Now, the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So (m/x)*100. Let's substitute m here. \n\nSo substituting m gives: [(25x/y)/x] * 100. The x in the numerator and denominator cancels out. So that becomes (25/y) * 100. \n\n25 times 100 is 2500.

Option D is 2500/y, so that's correct?\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nOriginal equation: x = (m/100) *4y. So x = (4m y)/100. Rearranged for m: multiply both sides by 100: 100x =4m y \u2192 m = (100x)/(4y) \u2192 m =25x/y. \n\nThen, m as a percentage of x is (m/x)*100 \u2192 (25x/y divided by x) *100 \u2192 25/y *100 \u2192 2500/y. Yes, that's correct. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 2500/y, so that's the answer. Let me check the other options to make sure I didn't mix up anything. \n\nOption E is 5000/y, which would be if I perhaps messed up a step. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let's try plugging numbers. Let's pick numbers where I can compute the answer and see if D works. \n\nSuppose y is 1, and m is, say, 10. Then x is (10% of 4*1) = 0.4. So x is 0.4. Now, m is 10, x is 0.4. The question is, m is what percentage of x? So 10 is what percent of 0.4? \n\nThe calculation: (10 / 0.4)*100 = 2500%. Which would be 2500 divided by y (since y=1 here), so 2500/1 = 2500. Which matches. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose y = 2, m = 20. Then x would be (20% of 4*2) = 20% of 8 = 1.6. Then m is 20, so 20 / 1.6 = 12.5, and as a percentage that's 1250%. \n\nUsing the formula 2500/y, where y=2, 2500/2 is 1250, so that matches. \n\nAnother test case: y = 5. Let m be 5. Then x is (5% of 4*5) = 5% of 20 = 1. So m is 5, x is 1. The percentage is (5/1)*100 = 500%. According to the formula, 2500/5 = 500. Correct. \n\nSo that seems to check out. \n\nHmm, so the answer is D. Let me look again at the options to make sure I didn't misread. The options are A:y/400, B:4y, C:50y, D:2500/y, E:5000/y. So D is correct. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So the answer must be D.\n",

Then, divide both sides by 4y: m = (100x)/(4y). Simplify that, m = (25x)/y. \n\nWait, so m = (25x)/y. Now, the question is asking for m as a percentage of x. So (m/x)*100. Let's substitute m here. \n\nSo substituting m gives: [(25x/y)/x] * 100. The x in the numerator and denominator cancels out. So that becomes (25/y) * 100. \n\n25 times 100 is 2500. So that gives 2500/y percent. \n\nHmm, so the answer would be 2500/y, which is option D. Let me check the options again. Option D is 2500/y, so that's correct?\n\nWait, let me go through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nOriginal equation: x = (m/100) *4y. So x = (4m y)/100. Rearranged for m: multiply both sides by 100: 100x =4m y \u2192 m = (100x)/(4y) \u2192 m =25x/y. \n\nThen, m as a percentage of x is (m/x)*100 \u2192 (25x/y divided by x) *100 \u2192 25/y *100 \u2192 2500/y. Yes, that's correct. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 2500/y, so that's the answer. Let me check the other options to make sure I didn't mix up anything. \n\nOption E is 5000/y, which would be if I perhaps messed up a step. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, let's try plugging numbers. Let's pick numbers where I can compute the answer and see if D works. \n\nSuppose y is 1, and m is, say, 10. Then x is (10% of 4*1) = 0.4. So x is 0.4. Now, m is 10, x is 0.4. The question is, m is what percentage of x? So 10 is what percent of 0.4? \n\nThe calculation: (10 / 0.4)*100 = 2500%. Which would be 2500 divided by y (since y=1 here), so 2500/1 = 2500. Which matches. \n\nAlternatively, if I choose y = 2, m = 20. Then x would be (20% of 4*2) = 20% of 8 = 1.6. Then m is 20, so 20 / 1.6 = 12.5, and as a percentage that's 1250%. \n\nUsing the formula 2500/y, where y=2, 2500/2 is 1250, so that matches. \n\nAnother test case: y = 5. Let m be 5. Then x is (5% of 4*5) = 5% of 20 = 1. So m is 5, x is 1. The percentage is (5/1)*100 = 500%. According to the formula, 2500/5 = 500. Correct. \n\nSo that seems to check out. \n\nHmm, so the answer is D. Let me look again at the options to make sure I didn't misread. The options are A:y/400, B:4y, C:50y, D:2500/y, E:5000/y. So D is correct. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So the answer must be D.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by translating the given relationship into an equation. Since \\( x \\) is \\( m\\% \\) of \\( 4y \\), we have:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{m}{100} \\times 4y\n\\]\nRearranging this equation to solve for \\( m \\):\n\\[\n100x = 4ym \\implies m = \\frac{100x}{4y} = \\frac{25x}{y}\n\\]\nNext, we need to determine \\( m \\) as a percentage of \\( x \\). The formula for this percentage is:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{m}{x} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\nSubstituting the expression for \\( m \\):\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{\\frac{25x}{y}}{x} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{25}{y} \\right) \\times 100 = \\frac{2500}{y}\n\\]\nThus, the answer is \\( \\frac{2500}{y} \\), which corresponds to option D. Testing with numerical examples confirms the validity of this result.\n\nAnswer: D",
