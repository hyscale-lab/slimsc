      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about a two-digit number. Let me read it again carefully. \n\nThe problem states: A two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. Also, the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place. We need to find the number from the given options.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Let me denote the ten's digit as, say, x. Then the unit's digit would be double that, so 2x. Since it's a two-digit number, the actual number can be represented as 10 times the ten's digit plus the unit's digit. So the number is 10x + 2x. Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the unit's digit is 2x, so the number is 10x + (2x) which is 12x. Wait, but that might not be the case. Wait, actually, the number is 10 times the ten's digit plus the unit's digit, so yes, 10x + 2x. So that part is correct.\n\nNow, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. The sum of the digits is x (ten's) plus 2x (unit's) which is 3x. So the number is equal to the sum plus 18. The number is 12x, so the equation would be:\n\n12x = (x + 2x) + 18  \nSimplifying the right side: 3x + 18. \n\nSo 12x = 3x + 18. Subtract 3x from both sides: 9x = 18. Then x = 2. \n\nSo the ten's digit is 2, and the unit's digit is 2*2=4. So the number is 24. Wait, but option B is 24. But let me check the options again. The options are A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49. \n\nHmm, but wait a second. Let me verify my steps again because sometimes I might have messed up. Let's see:\n\nThe number is 10x + y. Here, y = 2x, so substituting, the number is 10x +2x =12x. The sum of the digits is x + y = x + 2x=3x. The problem says the number exceeds the sum by 18, so:\n\nNumber = sum +18  \n12x = 3x +18  \nYes, that gives 9x=18 \u2192x=2. So the number is 12*2=24. That's B. \n\nWait, but let me check if the options include 24. Yes, option B is 24. But wait, another thought: maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup? Let me think again. \n\nThe problem says the number exceeds the sum by 18. So (number) - (sum) =18. Which is exactly what I did. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the digits are such that when x is 2, the unit digit is 4, so 24. Let's test it. \n\n24: sum of digits is 2+4=6. 24-6=18. Yes, that works. \n\nSo then why is there an option C)42? Let me see if that also works. Let's check 42. Sum of digits is 4+2=6. 42-6=36, which is way more than 18. So that's not it. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me see another approach. \n\nSuppose the ten's digit is x, unit's is y. Then the number is 10x + y. \n\nGiven that y = 2x (unit's digit is double the ten's). \n\nAlso, (10x + y) - (x + y) =18. \n\nSimplify that equation: 10x + y -x -y = 9x =18 \u2192 x=2. \n\nSo same result. So x is 2, y=4. So number is 24. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be B. But wait, looking at the options again, the options include 42, which is the reverse. Did I mix up the digits?\n\nWait, the problem says \"the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place\". So unit's digit is 2x, ten's is x. So 24 is correct. Because the unit digit is 4 (which is 2*2). So yes, that's correct. \n\nHmm, so the correct answer must be B)24. But wait, looking at the options given again, the options are A)12, B)24, C)42, D)48, E)49. \n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me check all options just to be thorough. \n\nTesting option C)42: Ten's digit is 4, unit is 2. But according to the condition, the unit digit should be double the ten's. 2 is not double of 4. So that's invalid. So C is out. \n\nOption D)48: Ten's is 4, unit is 8. Then unit is double of 4, yes. Let's check the difference. Sum of digits:4+8=12. 48-12=36, which is not 18. So that's not it. \n\nOption E)49: unit digit 9 is not double of 4 (since 4*2=8). So no. \n\nOption A)12: ten's digit 1, unit 2 (which is double). Sum is 3. 12-3=9, not 18. So no. \n\nSo only B)24 works. So the answer must be B. \n\nWait, but the options given include B as 24 and C as 42. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's wording. Let me read again. \n\nThe problem says \"the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place\". So unit digit is 2x, ten's is x. So yes, 24 is correct. \n\nHmm, but why does the option C exist? Maybe a common mistake where someone swaps the digits? Like if someone thought the ten's digit is double the unit's, but that's not the case here. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B)24.\n",

Wait, the unit's digit is 2x, so the number is 10x + (2x) which is 12x? Wait, but that's the numerical value. \n\nThe problem says the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. The sum of the digits is x + 2x, which is 3x. So the number (which is 10x + 2x = 12x) minus the sum (3x) equals 18. Let me write that equation out:\n\n12x - (x + 2x) = 18. \n\nSimplifying the sum part: x + 2x is 3x. So the equation becomes 12x - 3x = 18. That's 9x = 18. So x would be 2. Then the ten's digit is 2, and the unit's digit is 4 (since 2*2=4). So the number is 24. Wait, but let me check the options. Option B is 24. But wait, hold on. Wait, let me verify again because I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the number is 10x + y, where x is the ten's digit and y is the unit's. Since y is double x, so y=2x. Therefore the number is 10x + 2x =12x. The sum of the digits is x + y = x + 2x =3x. The problem states the number exceeds the sum by 18. So:\n\nNumber - sum =18 \u2192 12x - 3x =18 \u2192 9x=18 \u2192 x=2. So x is 2, so the number is 12*2=24. So that would be option B. But wait, looking at the options, option C is 42. Hmm. Wait a second, maybe I messed up the digits. Because if x is the ten's digit and y is the unit's, then if x is 2, the number is 24, which is B. But let me check again. Let me test the options given. Let me see each option and see which fits.\n\nTake option B:24. The digits are 2 and 4. The sum is 6. The number minus sum is 24-6=18. That's correct. So that works. Then why is there an option C as 42? Let me see if I misread the problem. The question says the digit at the unit's place is double the ten's. So unit's digit is 2 times ten's. So in 24, unit is 4, ten's is 2. 4 is 2x2, so that works. So 24 is correct, which is option B. But wait, I thought maybe the other way around? Like maybe I had the digits reversed. Wait no, the unit's digit is double the ten's. So ten's is x, unit is 2x. So 24 is correct. So then the answer should be B. But let me check other options just to be sure.\n\nTake option C:42. Ten's digit is 4, unit is 2. But then the unit's digit (2) is not double the ten's (4). Because 2 is half of 4, so that's the reverse. So that doesn't fit the second condition. So 42 is out. Option D is 48. Ten's 4, unit 8. Then unit is double ten's? 8 is 2*4, so yes. Then let's check the first condition. The number is 48. Sum of digits 4+8=12. 48-12=36, which is not 18. So that's not correct. So D is wrong.\n\nOption A:12. Ten's 1, unit 2. Sum is 3. 12-3=9. Not 18. So no. E is 49. Ten's 4, unit 9. 9 isn't double 4. So no. So the correct answer must be B, 24. Wait but wait, the options given include C)42. Maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check the equations again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in forming the equation. Let me re-express the problem.\n\nLet me denote the ten's digit as T and unit's digit as U. The number is 10T + U. The sum of digits is T + U. The problem states that the number exceeds the sum by 18, so:\n\n10T + U = (T + U) + 18. \n\nSimplify that: 10T + U - T - U = 18 \u2192 9T =18 \u2192 T=2. So T is 2. Then, since U is double T, U=2*T=4. So the number is 24. So B is correct. So why is there an option C? Maybe I need to check again. Wait, perhaps the problem says the unit's digit is double the ten's. So U = 2*T. So yes, 2 and 4 gives U=4, which is 2x2. So 24 is correct. So the answer should be B. \n\nHmm, but sometimes I might have misread the problem. Let me check once again. The problem says \"the digit at the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place\". So unit digit is twice ten's. So yes, 24 fits. So the answer is B. But why is there a 42 as an option? Maybe a common mistake where someone swaps the digits. Like solving T=4 and U=8 but that's not. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me see the equation again.\n\nWait the equation: the number is 10T + U. The sum is T + U. The number is larger than the sum by 18, so 10T + U = (T + U) +18 \u2192 subtract (T+U) from both sides: 9T =18 \u2192 T=2. So that's solid. So the answer is 24, option B.

So unit digit is twice ten's. So yes, 24 fits. So the answer is B. But why is there a 42 as an option? Maybe a common mistake where someone swaps the digits. Like solving T=4 and U=8 but that's not. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation. Let me see the equation again.\n\nWait the equation: the number is 10T + U. The sum is T + U. The number is larger than the sum by 18, so 10T + U = (T + U) +18 \u2192 subtract (T+U) from both sides: 9T =18 \u2192 T=2. So that's solid. So the answer is 24, option B. So the correct answer is B.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let the ten's digit be \\( x \\) and the unit's digit be \\( 2x \\) (since the unit's digit is double the ten's). The two-digit number can be expressed as \\( 10x + 2x = 12x \\). The sum of the digits is \\( x + 2x = 3x \\). According to the problem, the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18:\n\n\\[\n12x - 3x = 18 \\implies 9x = 18 \\implies x = 2\n\\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 2 \\), the ten's digit is 2 and the unit's digit is \\( 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\). Thus, the number is \\( 10 \\times 2 + 4 = 24 \\).\n\nVerifying with the options:\n- **Option B (24)**: The digits sum to \\( 2 + 4 = 6 \\), and \\( 24 - 6 = 18 \\), which satisfies the condition.\n- Other options fail either the digit ratio condition (e.g., 42 has unit's digit half the ten's) or the numerical condition (e.g., 48's difference is 36, not 18).\n\nAnswer: B",
