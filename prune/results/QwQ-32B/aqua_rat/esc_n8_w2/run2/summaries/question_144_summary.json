      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about independent events A and B. The probability of A is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of them occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability of B happening. Hmm, right, since they are independent, their probabilities multiply when considering both happening. Wait, but the question is about at least one. \n\nSo the formula for the probability of at least one of A or B occurring is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). But since they are independent, P(A and B) is P(A)*P(B). So putting it all together: P(A \u2228 B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B). \n\nThe problem states that this equals 0.96. Let me write that equation out. Let me denote P(B) as x for simplicity. So substituting the known values:\n\n0.6 + x - (0.6)(x) = 0.96\n\nWait, let me make sure I got that equation right. The formula is P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B) because when events are independent, the intersection is the product. So yes, that equation should be correct. \n\nSo rearranging the equation: 0.6 + x - 0.6x = 0.96. Let me combine the x terms. The x -0.6x is 0.4x. So the equation becomes:\n\n0.6 + 0.4x = 0.96\n\nSubtract 0.6 from both sides: 0.4x = 0.36. Then x = 0.36 / 0.4. Let me compute that. 0.36 divided by 0.4. Hmm, 0.36 divided by 0.4 is the same as 36/40, which simplifies to 9/10. Wait, 36 divided by 40 is 0.9? Wait, no, 36 divided by 40 is 0.9? Wait, no, 40 times 0.9 is 36. So yes, 36/40 is 0.9. Wait, but 0.36 divided by 0.4 is 0.9? Let me check again. 0.4 times 0.9 is 0.36. Yes, so x is 0.9. \n\nBut wait, that would make option E) 0.9. But that seems high. Let me check my steps again. Because if B has a probability of 0.9, then the probability of at least one of A or B would be 0.6 +0.9 - (0.6*0.9) = 1.5 - 0.54 = 0.96. Oh, that actually works. Because 0.6 +0.9 is 1.5, subtract 0.54 gives 0.96. So that's correct. But why did I think it was high? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it another way. Since the events are independent, the probability that neither occurs is (1 - P(A))*(1 - P(B)). The probability of at least one is 1 minus that. So:\n\n1 - (1 - 0.6)(1 - x) = 0.96\n\nSo 1 - [0.4*(1 - x)] = 0.96\n\nSubtract 1: -0.4*(1 -x) = -0.04\n\nMultiply both sides by -1: 0.4*(1 - x) = 0.04\n\nThen 1 - x = 0.04 /0.4 = 0.1\n\nSo 1 -x = 0.1 \u2192 x = 0.9. Yep, same result. So the answer must be E) 0.9. But the options given include E as 0.9. So why is the question here? Maybe I made a mistake in reading the question? Let me check the problem again. \n\nWait the problem says \"the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96\". So according to calculations, yes, that's correct. So B is 0.9. The options have E as 0.9. So the answer is E. \n\nWait but looking at the options, the first thought I had was \"Hmm, 0.9 seems high, but the math checks out\". So maybe the answer is E. Let me see the options again. The options are A)0.5, B)0.6, C)0.7, D)0.8, E)0.9. So E is an option, so that's correct. \n\nHmm, perhaps I should check once more. Let me plug in another option to see. Suppose someone thought the answer was D)0.8. Let's see what would happen. Let's say x is 0.8. Then the probability of at least one is 0.6 +0.8 - (0.6*0.8) = 1.4 -0.48=0.92, which is less than 0.96, so that's not right. \n\nIf x is 0.7, then 0.6+0.7 -0.42 = 1.3-0.42=0.88. Nope. So only 0.9 gives 0.96. So yes, the answer must be E.\n",

The probability of A happening is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of A or B occurs is 0.96. I need to find the probability of B occurring. The options are from 0.5 to 0.9. Hmm.\n\nAlright, let's recall some probability formulas. Since A and B are independent, the probability of both happening is P(A) * P(B). Right? Because for independent events, the occurrence of one doesn't affect the other. \n\nThe problem mentions the probability that at least one of them occurs. The formula for that is P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \u2229 B). Since they are independent, P(A \u2229 B) is P(A)*P(B). \n\nSo substituting that into the formula, we have P(A \u222a B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B). \n\nWe know P(A) is 0.6, and P(A \u222a B) is 0.96. Let me plug those values into the equation and solve for P(B). Let's call P(B) as x to make it easier.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6)(x)\n\nLet me rearrange that. Let's see, expanding the right side: 0.6 + x - 0.6x. Combining like terms: 0.6 + x(1 - 0.6) = 0.6 + 0.4x.\n\nSo the equation is 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4x. Now I can solve for x. Subtract 0.6 from both sides:\n\n0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4x\n0.36 = 0.4x\n\nThen x = 0.36 / 0.4. Let me calculate that. 0.36 divided by 0.4.

So the formula is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it another way. The probability of at least one is 0.96. So the probability that neither occurs is 1 - 0.96 = 0.04. \n\nSince A and B are independent, the probability that neither occurs is (1 - P(A))*(1 - P(B)). \n\nAh, right! That might be another way to compute it. Let me try that. \n\nSo, P(neither) = (1 - 0.6)(1 - x) = 0.4*(1 - x) = 0.04. \n\nSo, 0.4*(1 - x) = 0.04 \u2192 1 - x = 0.04 / 0.4 \u2192 1 - x = 0.1 \u2192 x = 0.9. \n\nSame result.
