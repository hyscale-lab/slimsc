      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression. The common difference is 3 months. The youngest is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find how many members are in the club. The options are given from A to E.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling what an arithmetic progression (AP) is. In an AP, each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant difference. Here, the difference is 3 months. Wait, but the ages are in years, so maybe I should convert that difference into years? Because 3 months is a quarter of a year, right? So 3 months is 0.25 years. That's important because the sum is given in years, I assume.\n\nThe first term (a\u2081) is 7 years. The common difference (d) is 0.25 years. Let the number of terms (n) be what we're trying to find. The sum of the AP is given by the formula S\u2099 = n/2 [2a\u2081 + (n-1)d]. The problem states that S\u2099 = 250. So plugging in the known values:\n\n250 = (n/2) [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nLet me compute that step by step. First, simplify the terms inside the brackets. 2*7 is 14. Then, (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25n - 0.25. So adding those together: 14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n.\n\nSo the equation becomes 250 = (n/2) * (13.75 + 0.25n). Let me multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nExpanding that gives:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 + 13.75n - 500 = 0\n\nHmm, quadratic equation. Let me multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n - 2000 = 0 ?\n\nWait, let me check:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 *4 = n\u00b2, 13.75n*4=55n, 500*4=2000. But the equation was 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n = 500, so moving everything to left gives 0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0. Multiply by 4 gives n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. Yes, that's correct.\n\nNow, solving the quadratic equation n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0. Let's use the quadratic formula: n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a). Here a=1, b=55, c= -2000.\n\nDiscriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025. The square root of 11025 is... Let me think. 100 squared is 10000, 105 squared is 11025, right? Because 100\u00b2 is 10000, 105\u00b2 = (100+5)^2 = 10000 + 1000 +25 = 11025. Exactly. So sqrt(D)=105.\n\nSo n = [ -55 \u00b1105 ] / 2. Since n can't be negative, we take the positive solution: ( -55 +105 ) /2 = 50/2 =25. Or wait, wait, 105-55 is 50? 105-55 is 50? Wait 105-55 is indeed 50. So 50 divided by 2 is 25. So n=25.\n\nWait, but the options include 25 as option C. So that's the answer? Hmm. Let me verify again because sometimes there could be a mistake in the setup.\n\nLet me check the steps again. The common difference is 3 months, which is 0.25 years. The first term is 7. The sum is 250. The formula S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]. Plugging in the numbers:\n\n250 = n/2 [14 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nWait, (n-1)*0.25 is 0.25(n-1). So 14 +0.25(n-1). Let me expand that again:\n\n14 + 0.25n -0.25 = 13.75 +0.25n. Yes that's correct. So the equation is correct. Then multiplying through gives the quadratic which solves to n=25. So 25 is the answer, which is option C.\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe there's an error in how the common difference is applied. The problem says the ages are in AP with common difference 3 months. So each subsequent member is 3 months older than the previous. So if the first is 7, the next is 7.25 years, then 7.5, etc. But when calculating the sum, all terms are in years. So the setup is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic equation. Let me check:\n\nOriginal equation after multiplying by 4:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0. Let me plug n=25 into that equation. 25\u00b2 is 625, plus 55*25 = 1375. 625 +1375 = 2000. Then 2000 -2000 =0. Yes, that works. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the answer should be 25, option C. Let me check the options again. The options are A)18, B)20, C)25, D)26, E)27. So C is indeed there. \n\nWait, but maybe the question is in months? Wait, no. The problem says the sum of the ages of all the members is 250. The units here are important. If the ages are in years, then the sum is 250 years. But perhaps the problem expects the ages to be in years and months, but the sum is given in years. Wait, the question says \"sum of the ages of all the members is 250\"\u2014so probably 250 years total. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should have converted all ages into months? Let me see. Let's try that approach to confirm.\n\nIf I convert all ages into months, then the common difference is 3 months, and the first term is 7*12=84 months. The sum would be 250 years, which is 250*12=3000 months. Then using the same formula:\n\nSum S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d]\n\nHere, a =84 months, d=3 months. The sum S is 3000 months.\n\nSo 3000 = n/2 [2*84 + (n-1)*3]\n\nCalculating inside the brackets: 168 + 3(n-1) =168 +3n -3= 165 +3n.\n\nSo 3000 = (n/2)(3n + 165)\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 6000 =n(3n + 165)\n\nWhich gives 3n\u00b2 +165n -6000=0\n\nDivide both sides by 3: n\u00b2 +55n -2000=0, which is the same equation as before. So the solution is n=25 again. So that's consistent. So the answer is indeed 25, which is option C. \n\nHmm, so I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes here. So the answer should be C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression (AP). The common difference is 3 months, which is 0.25 years, right? The youngest is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find how many members there are. The options are given, so maybe I can use the AP formulas to figure it out.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for the sum of an AP. The sum S of n terms is S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term, d the common difference. Alternatively, it can also be written as S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the nth term. Since the common difference here is in months, I should convert that to years. 3 months is 0.25 years. So d = 0.25.\n\nThe first term a is 7 years. The sum S is 250. So plugging into the formula:\n\n250 = n/2 [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nLet me compute that step by step. Let's write out the equation again:\n\n250 = (n/2) [14 + 0.25(n -1)]\n\nHmm, maybe expanding that. Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n [14 + 0.25(n - 1)]\n\nLet me expand the bracket:\n\n14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n\n\nWait, 14 minus 0.25 is 13.75. So the equation becomes:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nLet me rearrange that into a quadratic equation:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals might be a bit messy. Maybe multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 *4 = n\u00b2, 13.75n *4=55n, 500*4=2000. Wait, but the equation after multiplying by 4 would be:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n -2000 = 0 ?\n\nWait, let me check again. The original equation after expanding was 500 = n*(13.75 +0.25n). So moving everything to left:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0. Multiply all terms by 4:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0. Yes, that's right. So now I have a quadratic equation in n.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0. So a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nCalculating discriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025.\n\nSquare root of 11025. Let me see, 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2 is 10000, 105\u00b2 is 11025. Yes, sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo n = [ -55 \u00b1105 ] / 2. We can discard the negative solution since n must be positive.\n\nSo n = ( -55 +105 ) /2 = 50/2 =25. Or the other solution would be ( -55 -105)/2 which is negative. So n=25. \n\nLooking at the options, C is 25. So the answer should be C?\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when setting up equations, maybe I made an error in the setup.\n\nLet me verify. Let's suppose there are 25 members. The first term a=7, common difference 0.25. The last term would be a_n = a + (n-1)d. So 7 + 24*(0.25) = 7 +6 =13. So the ages go from 7 to 13, in steps of 0.25 each. The sum would be n*(a1 + an)/2 =25*(7+13)/2 =25*(20/2)=25*10=250. Which matches the given sum. So that works. So 25 is correct, option C.\n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation setup. Let me retrace the steps again.\n\nOriginal equation: Sum S =250 = (n/2)[2a + (n-1)d]\n\nPlugging in a=7, d=0.25:\n\n250 = n/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 500 =n [14 +0.25(n-1)]\n\nExpanding inside the brackets:\n\n14 +0.25n -0.25 = 13.75 +0.25n. So yes, that's correct.\n\nThus 500 =n*(0.25n +13.75)\n\nMultiply by 4: 2000 = n*(n +55). Wait, because 0.25n*4 is n, 13.75*4 is 55. So 0.25n +13.75 multiplied by 4 gives (n +55). So 500*4 is 2000 = n(n+55). So the equation is n^2 +55n -2000 =0, which is exactly what I had before. So the solution is indeed n=25. So the correct answer is C)25.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a club where the members' ages form an arithmetic progression (AP). The common difference is 3 months, which is 0.25 years, right? The youngest is 7 years old, and the total sum of all their ages is 250. I need to find how many members there are. The options are given, so maybe I can use the AP formulas to figure it out.\n\nFirst, let me recall the formula for the sum of an AP. The sum S of n terms is S = n/2 [2a + (n-1)d], where a is the first term, d the common difference. Alternatively, it can also be written as S = n*(a1 + an)/2, where a1 is the first term and an is the nth term. Since the common difference here is in months, I should convert that to years. 3 months is 0.25 years. So d = 0.25.\n\nThe first term a is 7 years. The sum S is 250. So plugging into the formula:\n\n250 = n/2 [2*7 + (n-1)*0.25]\n\nLet me compute that step by step. Let's write out the equation again:\n\n250 = (n/2) [14 + 0.25(n -1)]\n\nHmm, maybe expanding that. Let's multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n500 = n [14 + 0.25(n - 1)]\n\nLet me expand the bracket:\n\n14 + 0.25n - 0.25 = 13.75 + 0.25n\n\nWait, 14 minus 0.25 is 13.75. So the equation becomes:\n\n500 = n*(13.75 + 0.25n)\n\nLet me rearrange that into a quadratic equation:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0\n\nHmm, dealing with decimals might be a bit messy. Maybe multiply all terms by 4 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 *4 = n\u00b2, 13.75n *4=55n, 500*4=2000. Wait, but the equation after multiplying by 4 would be:\n\nn\u00b2 + 55n -2000 = 0 ?\n\nWait, let me check again. The original equation after expanding was 500 = n*(13.75 +0.25n). So moving everything to left:\n\n0.25n\u00b2 +13.75n -500 =0. Multiply all terms by 4:\n\nn\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0. Yes, that's right. So now I have a quadratic equation in n.\n\nI can use the quadratic formula here. The quadratic is n\u00b2 +55n -2000 =0. So a=1, b=55, c=-2000.\n\nThe quadratic formula is n = [-b \u00b1 sqrt(b\u00b2 -4ac)]/(2a)\n\nCalculating discriminant D = 55\u00b2 -4*1*(-2000) = 3025 +8000 = 11025.\n\nSquare root of 11025. Let me see, 105 squared is 11025 because 100\u00b2 is 10000, 105\u00b2 is 11025. Yes, sqrt(11025)=105.\n\nSo n = [ -55 \u00b1105 ] / 2. We can discard the negative solution since n must be positive.\n\nSo n = ( -55 +105 ) /2 = 50/2 =25. Or the other solution would be ( -55 -105)/2 which is negative. So n=25. \n\nLooking at the options, C is 25. So the answer should be C?\n\nWait, but let me check again because sometimes when setting up equations, maybe I made an error in the setup.\n\nLet me verify. Let's suppose there are 25 members. The first term a=7, common difference 0.25. The last term would be a_n = a + (n-1)d. So 7 + 24*(0.25) = 7 +6 =13. So the ages go from 7 to 13, in steps of 0.25 each. The sum would be n*(a1 + an)/2 =25*(7+13)/2 =25*(20/2)=25*10=250. Which matches the given sum. So that works. So 25 is correct, option C.\n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the quadratic equation setup. Let me retrace the steps again.\n\nOriginal equation: Sum S =250 = (n/2)[2a + (n-1)d]\n\nPlugging in a=7, d=0.25:\n\n250 = n/2 [14 + 0.25(n-1)]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2: 500 =n [14 +0.25(n-1)]\n\nExpanding inside the brackets:\n\n14 +0.25n -0.25 = 13.75 +0.25n. So yes, that's correct.\n\nThus 500 =n*(0.25n +13.75)\n\nMultiply by 4: 2000 = n*(n +55). Wait, because 0.25n*4 is n, 13.75*4 is 55. So 0.25n +13.75 multiplied by 4 gives (n +55). So 500*4 is 2000 = n(n+55). So the equation is n^2 +55n -2000 =0, which is exactly what I had before. So the solution is indeed n=25. So the correct answer is C)25.
