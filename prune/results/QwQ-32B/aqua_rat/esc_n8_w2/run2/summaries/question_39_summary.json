      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about figuring out the monthly sales needed for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. The salary structure is a fixed $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales. Hmm, right. So I need to set up an equation here.\n\nFirst, the total salary S is equal to the fixed part plus 5% of sales. Let me write that down. The formula would be S = 500 + 0.05 * (monthly sales). The problem says S needs to be $1500. So substituting that in, we get 1500 = 500 + 0.05 * X, where X is the monthly sales we're trying to find.\n\nAlright, now I need to solve for X. Let me subtract the fixed part first. Subtract 500 from both sides: 1500 - 500 = 0.05X. That simplifies to 1000 = 0.05X. To find X, I should divide both sides by 0.05. Let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 0.05. Wait, 0.05 is the same as 5%, so dividing by 0.05 is the same as multiplying by 20. Because 1/0.05 is 20. So 1000 * 20 equals 20,000. So X would be $20,000?\n\nLooking at the options, D is $20,000. But wait a second, let me double-check my math to be sure. Let me redo the calculation:\n\n1500 - 500 is indeed 1000. Then 1000 divided by 0.05. Let me do it step by step. 0.05 times X = 1000. So X = 1000 / 0.05. 0.05 goes into 1000 how many times? Well, 0.05 times 20,000 is 1,000. Because 0.05 * 20,000 = 1,000. So yes, that's correct. Then the sales needed are $20,000. So the answer should be D?\n\nWait, but let me think again. The options given include D as $20,000, so that's the one. But hold on, maybe I made a mistake in the percentage. Let me confirm the problem statement again. The salary is fixed $500 plus 5% of sales. So 5% of the sales must make up the difference between 500 and 1500. The difference is 1000, so 5% of sales is 1000. So sales would be 1000 divided by 0.05, which is indeed 20,000. So yes, D is correct. But wait, the options have E as \"None of these\". Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA) $50,000\n\nB) $40,000\n\nC) $30,000\n\nD) $20,000\n\nE) None of these.\n\nHmm, since D is exactly $20k, which matches my calculation, so the answer must be D. So why is E an option here? Maybe I did something wrong. Let me see again.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the percentage? The problem says 5% of all monthly sales. So 5% of X is 0.05X. Yes. So 500 + 0.05X =1500. Solving gives X=20,000. So D is correct. Therefore the answer is D. So the correct option is D. So I think the answer is D. But let me check once more. Suppose the sales are 20,000, then 5% of that is 1,000. Adding to 500 gives 1,500. Exactly. So yes, D is the right choice. So E is not necessary here. Therefore the answer should be D.\n",
