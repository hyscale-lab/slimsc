      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so the question is about population growth over the past year and the next two years. The key here is to set up the right equations, right?\n\nAlright, let's parse the problem again. The Boomtown planners expect a 10% increase each year for the next two years. If that happens, the population in two years will be double what it was one year ago. We need to find the percentage increase over the last year. The options are given, so maybe I can model this with variables.\n\nLet me denote the population one year ago as P. Then, the current population (which is the population now, after the last year's change) would be something like P multiplied by (1 plus the growth rate from last year). Wait, but the question is asking for the percent increase over the last year. Let's call that unknown percentage 'x'. So last year's population was P, and this year's is P*(1 + x/100), right?\n\nWait, actually, maybe I should structure it more clearly. Let's think of the timeline. Let's say today is time 0. One year ago would be time -1, and the population two years from now would be time +2. The problem states that the population at time +2 is double the population at time -1. \n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet\u2019s let the population one year ago (time -1) be P. \n\nCurrent population (time 0) is then P multiplied by (1 + r), where r is the growth rate from last year (the one we need to find, expressed as a decimal). \n\nNext year (time +1), the population would be the current population times 1.1 (since it's increasing by 10%). Then the following year (time +2), it would be that times another 1.1. \n\nSo the population at time +2 is (P*(1 + r)) * 1.1 * 1.1. \n\nAccording to the problem, this equals 2*P (since it's double the population one year ago, which was P). \n\nSo the equation is:\n\nP*(1 + r)*(1.1)^2 = 2*P \n\nHmm, right. The P cancels out from both sides. That leaves:\n\n(1 + r) * (1.21) = 2 \n\nBecause 1.1 squared is 1.21. \n\nSo solving for (1 + r):\n\n1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \n\nCalculating 2 divided by 1.21. Let me do that. Let's see, 1.21 times 1.65 is approximately 2? Let me check: 1.21 * 1.65. Let's compute 1.21*1.6 = 1.936, and 1.21*0.05 is 0.0605. So total would be 1.936 + 0.0605 = ~1.9965, which is almost 2. So 1.65 would be approximately 2/1.21. But let me do it more precisely.\n\n2 divided by 1.21. Let me compute this. 1.21 \u00d7 1.65289...? Let me see:\n\n1.21 \u00d7 1.65 = approx 1.9965. \n\nWait, so 2 divided by 1.21 equals approximately 1.65289... So 1 + r \u2248 1.65289. So r \u2248 0.65289, which is 65.289%. \n\nLooking at the options, the closest is D)65%. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me double-check.\n\nOriginal population one year ago: P.\n\nCurrent population (now) is P*(1 + r). \n\nAfter one year (next year): current *1.1, so P*(1+r)*1.1.\n\nAfter two years: that times 1.1 again \u2192 P*(1+r)*(1.1)^2.\n\nThe problem states that this equals 2P (double the population of one year ago, which was P). So the equation is correct. \n\nSo solving (1 + r) * 1.21 = 2 \u2192 1 + r = 2 / 1.21 \u2248 1.65289. \n\nSo r \u2248 65.28%, which is closest to 65% (option D). \n\nWait, the options are A)20%, B)40%, C)50%, D)65%, E)75%. \n\nSo yes, 65.28% is very close to D. \n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the percentage? Let me think again. The question asks for the percent population increase over the last year. So the increase from one year ago to now is (current population - P)/P *100%, which is exactly the r we calculated. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated 2 divided by 1.21. Let me compute 2/1.21 precisely. Let's do division:\n\n1.21 \u00d7 1.65 = 1.21*(1 + 0.6 + 0.05) = 1.21 + 0.726 + 0.0605 = 1.21+0.726 is 1.936, plus 0.0605 gives 1.9965. So 1.65 gives 1.9965, which is just under 2. So 1.65 is a bit less than the actual value. So 1.65 gives 1.9965. To get to 2, the multiplier needs to be a bit more. \n\nThe difference between 2 and 1.9965 is 0.0035. Since each 0.01 increment in the multiplier (like 1.65 + 0.01 = 1.66) would add 1.21 *0.01 = 0.0121 to the product. Wait, no, actually, the multiplier is (1 + r) = 2/1.21. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, 2 divided by 1.21. Let me compute 2 / 1.21:\n\n1.21 \u00d7 1.65289 = 2. Because 1.21 \u00d7 1.65289 \u2248 2. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute 1.21 \u00d7 1.65289:\n\nLet me approximate 2/1.21 = 1.652882... So that's approximately 1.65288, so r is approximately 65.288%, which is very close to 65%. The next option is E)75%, which is 10% higher. So 65 is the closest. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D)65%.\n",

We need to find the percentage increase over the last year. Wait, the last year meaning from the current population to last year's? Or is the current population the starting point?\n\nLet me parse the problem again. Let's denote variables. Let me think of the population at different times. Let me set up some variables. Let me call the population one year ago as P. Then the current population (now) would be P plus some increase. Wait, but the question is about the population increase over the last year. So maybe the current population is compared to last year's population. Let me see.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago.\" So the population two years from now (after two years of 10% growth) is equal to 2 times the population from one year ago. \n\nSo let's define variables more precisely.

So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so I think D is the correct answer.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we define the population one year ago as \\( P \\). Let the current population be \\( C \\). The population two years from now, after two consecutive 10% annual increases, will be \\( C \\times (1.10)^2 \\). According to the problem, this equals twice the population one year ago (\\( 2P \\)):\n\n\\[\nC \\times (1.10)^2 = 2P\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( C \\):\n\n\\[\nC = \\frac{2P}{(1.10)^2} = \\frac{2P}{1.21} \\approx 1.65289P\n\\]\n\nThe percentage increase from one year ago (\\( P \\)) to now (\\( C \\)) is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{C - P}{P} \\times 100\\% = \\frac{1.65289P - P}{P} \\times 100\\% \\approx 65.289\\%\n\\]\n\nThe closest option to \\( 65.289\\% \\) is **65%**.\n\nAnswer: D",
