      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about figuring out how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy for 12 people instead of 8. Hmm, so the first thing I should do is understand the ratio from the original situation. \n\nSo originally, there were 8 people and she bought 10 bottles. Wait, so the question is probably assuming that each person drinks the same amount, right? So maybe it's a proportion problem. Let me think. If 8 people need 10 bottles, then per person, that would be 10 divided by 8. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25 bottles per person. \n\nNow, if there are 12 people, then we need to multiply 1.25 by 12 to find out how many bottles are needed. Let me do that math. 1.25 times 12. Well, 1 times 12 is 12, and 0.25 times 12 is 3, so adding those together gives 15. Wait a second, that would mean 15 bottles, but none of the options are 15. Oh, that's a problem. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate. 10 divided by 8 is indeed 1.25 per person. 1.25 multiplied by 12. Let me break it down again: 12 times 1 is 12, and 12 times 0.25 is 3, so total is 15. Hmm, but the options given are 6, 8, 10, 12, or 14. Wait, none of those are 15. Did I misinterpret the question?\n\nWait, maybe the question is not assuming a direct proportion. Maybe it's a different kind of relationship. Let me read the question again. It says \"needed to buy 10 bottles for a party with 8 people, how many for 12 people?\" So maybe it's a rate problem. Like, per person, how much soda do they drink, so 10/8 per person. Then for 12 people, that's (10/8)*12. Which is indeed 15. But since 15 isn't an option, maybe there's another way to look at it?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting a proportional reasoning where the number of bottles is in some ratio to the number of people, but maybe it's not exactly proportional. Let me see the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. \n\nHmm, perhaps the question is implying that each person drinks one bottle, but she bought 10 for 8 people. Wait, that would be more than one per person. Alternatively, maybe the question is expecting a rounded number? But 15 is not an option. Wait, maybe I did something wrong here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question. Like, if 8 people needed 10 bottles, maybe the number of bottles is not directly proportional. Maybe she's buying soda for the party, but maybe the number of bottles needed is based on something else. Wait, maybe it's a ratio problem where the ratio of people to bottles is 8:10, so simplifying that to 4:5. So for 12 people, set up the proportion 4/5 = 12/x. Wait, but that would give x = (5/4)*12 = 15 again. Still 15.\n\nHmm, but since 15 isn't an option here, perhaps the question is expecting an approximate answer? Or maybe I made a mistake in the setup. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that the number of bottles is the same as the number of people? But in the original case, she had 10 for 8, which is more than one each. So that might not be it. \n\nWait, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is 12, thinking that she just needs one per person. But the original had 8 people and 10 bottles. So maybe the extra two were for herself? Or maybe the question assumes that the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people, but rounded down? For example, 10/8 is 1.25. 12 times 1.25 is 15, but maybe they expect you to round to the nearest multiple of 2? 14 is the closest even number? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a proportion problem where you set up 8 people to 10 bottles as 12 people to x bottles. So 8/10 = 12/x \u2192 cross multiply: 8x = 120 \u2192 x=15. Again, same answer. Since 15 isn't there, maybe the options are wrong, but that can't be. Wait, perhaps the question is a trick question where the answer is 12, thinking that the original had more than needed, so now just 12 people get 1 each. But the question says \"needed to buy\"\u2014so maybe she needs to buy the same per person. But that would still be 1.25. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a unit conversion problem. Like, maybe the bottles are different sizes? But the question doesn't mention that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the number of bottles is in the same ratio as the number of people. So 8 to 12 is a 3/2 increase. So 10 multiplied by 3/2 is 15. Again, same result. So since 15 isn't an option, maybe the question has an error. But since the options are given, perhaps I misread the question?\n\nWait, let me read the question again. \"If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\"\n\nHmm. Maybe it's a rate problem where the number of bottles is inversely proportional? Like, more people, fewer bottles needed? That doesn't make sense here. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is implying that 10 bottles are enough for 8 people, so per person, it's 10/8 = 1.25. So for 12 people, she needs 12 * 1.25 = 15. But since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the question expects rounding down to 14? Because you can't have a fraction of a bottle. But 14 would be 14/12 \u2248 1.16 per person. But that's less than the original. Alternatively, maybe they expect you to round up to the nearest whole number. Since 12*1.25 is exactly 15, so you can't have half a bottle, so you need 15. But again, 15 isn't an option. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is a proportion question where they expect a different approach. Let me see the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question is not assuming proportional reasoning. Maybe it's a different approach. Like, if 8 people need 10 bottles, then the number of bottles per person is 10/8, but maybe it's a ratio where for every 2 people, she buys 2.5 bottles? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is 10, thinking that maybe the number of people increased by 50%, so the bottles also increase by 50%? 10 plus 5 is 15 again. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a mistake, but since I have to choose from the options given, maybe the closest possible? Like 14 is the closest to 15? So maybe E)14? Or perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is not assuming that each person drinks the same amount. Maybe the original 10 bottles were for the entire party, regardless of the number of people. But that would mean 10 bottles for any number of people, which would make the answer 10 again, but that's option C. But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking for a different number of people. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is implying that the number of bottles is proportional to the number of people, but using ratios like 8:10 simplifies to 4:5, so 12 people would need (5/4)*12 = 15. Still 15. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't have 15, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25. 1.25 multiplied by 12: 12 times 1 is 12, 12 times 0.25 is 3, so total 15. Yep, same as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects that the number of bottles is directly proportional but uses a different method. Maybe it's like, for 8 people, 10 bottles. So per person, it's 10/8 = 1.25. So for 12, it's 1.25*12. But maybe they want it rounded down to 12? But that would be 12, which is D. But that would mean she's providing less soda per person, which might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is 12 because she's just buying one per person. But the original had 8 people and 10 bottles, which is 2 extra. So perhaps she adds 2 extra bottles regardless of the number of people? Like 8 people had 10, so 2 extra. So for 12 people, it's 12 +2 =14? That would be E)14. \n\nAh! That's a possibility. Maybe she buys 2 extra regardless of the number of people. So the formula would be (number of people) + 2. So for 8, that gives 10. For 12, that gives 14. So the answer would be E)14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the extra is proportional? Like, 10 is 8 plus 25%. So 12 plus 25% would be 15 again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio between people and bottles is 4:5 (since 8:10 reduces to 4:5). So for 12 people, set up 4/5 = 12/x \u2192 x=15. \n\nHmm. Since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the question expects that extra 2 bottles. So 12 +2=14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed to test unit rate, and since 10 bottles for 8 people is 1.25 per person, and since you can't have a fraction of a bottle, she has to round up. So 12 people would need 15 bottles. But since that's not an option, perhaps the closest lower number is 14? But that would mean 14/12 is about 1.16 per person. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting a direct proportion but using whole numbers. Let's see: 8 people \u219210 bottles. So, how many for 12? Let me set up a proportion: 8/10 = 12/x. Wait, that would give x= (10*12)/8= 15. Same answer. \n\nHmm. Since 15 is not an option, maybe there's another way. Maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is 12, assuming that each person gets one bottle. But the original had 8 people and 10 bottles. So maybe the 2 extra were for the host, and now with more people, she adds another 2? 12 +2=14. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a rate problem where she buys soda for the party, and the number of bottles is proportional to the number of people, but the options given are wrong. But that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says: \"If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\" \n\nHmm. Maybe the question is implying that the number of bottles needed is the same as the number of people, but in the first case, she bought 10 for 8, which might have been a mistake. But the question is asking for the correct number for 12. So the correct number would be 12. But that would mean she overbought before. But the question says \"needed to buy\"\u2014so perhaps she needed 10 for 8, implying that's the correct amount, so for 12, it's more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the number of bottles increases by the same difference. The first time, 8 people, 10 bottles. The difference between 12 and 8 is 4. So adding 4 to the original 10 gives 14? That would be E. \n\nWait, that approach would be: the number of people increased by 4 (from 8 to 12), so the number of bottles increases by 4 as well, so 10+4=14. But that would be linear increase, but the ratio approach would be different. \n\nHmm, but why would that be the case? That's assuming that each additional person requires one more bottle. But the original had 8 people needing 10, so that would be 2 extra bottles for 8 people. If each person after the first 8 requires 1 bottle, but that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference between the number of people and the bottles is constant. 8 people had 10 bottles, so the difference is 2. So for 12 people, bottles would be 12 +2 =14. That would be E. \n\nAh! That might be the logic here. The difference between people and bottles is 2. So 8 people, 10 bottles (difference +2). So for 12 people, bottles would be 12 +2 =14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original had 2 extra bottles. So she always adds 2. So for any number of people, it's (number of people) + 2. So 8+2=10, 12+2=14. \n\nThat would fit the given options. \n\nSo perhaps that's the correct approach here. The problem is probably testing the understanding of ratios but maybe in a different way. Since 10 bottles for 8 people gives a per person rate of 1.25, but since you can't have a fraction, perhaps she rounds up. But if you have to provide whole bottles, then 12 people would need 15. But since that's not an option, the next best is 14. Alternatively, maybe she just adds 2 extra bottles regardless of the number of people. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simpler than I'm making it. Like, maybe it's a direct proportion but using a different method. Let me see:\n\nThe ratio of people is 8 to 12, which is 2:3. So the number of bottles would be (3/2)*10 = 15. Again, same result. \n\nHmm. Since the answer options don't have 15, I'm starting to think that maybe the question expects a different approach, perhaps a simple proportional reasoning where 8 people need 10, so 1 person needs 10/8, then 12 people need (10/8)*12 =15. But since that's not an option, maybe the options are wrong. But that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is 12. Because she needed 10 for 8 people, so maybe 1 per person plus 2 extra, so for 12, it would be 12 + 2 =14. That would be E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that the number of bottles increases by the same ratio as the people. The number of people increased by 50% (from 8 to 12 is an increase of 4, which is 50% of 8). So the bottles also increase by 50% of 10, which is 5, so 15. Again, same answer. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't have 15, but 14 is there, perhaps the question is expecting rounding down to the nearest whole number, even though that would mean less soda. But that seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25. 1.25 times 12: 12*1 is 12, 12*0.25 is 3, so total is 15. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not assuming that each person drinks the same amount. Maybe the 10 bottles were for the entire party, and she just needs the same amount regardless of the number of people. But that would mean 10 bottles for 12 people, so option C)10. But that doesn't make sense because the question says \"for a party in which 12 people are attending\", implying that more people would need more soda. \n\nHmm. Maybe the options are wrong, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a unit rate problem but using a different method. Let me think differently. \n\nSuppose that the 10 bottles were enough for 8 people, so the number of people per bottle is 8/10 = 0.8 people per bottle. So for 12 people, you need 12 / 0.8 = 15 bottles. Again, same number. \n\nHmm. This is frustrating. Since the options don't have 15, but the question is presented, maybe there's an error in the question's options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I need to pick the closest one. But 15 is closer to 14 than 12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the question is expecting a simple ratio of 8:10 simplifies to 4:5, so for 12 people, which is 3 times 4, the bottles would be 3 times 5, which is 15. \n\nWait, but the options are given, so maybe the question had a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the number of bottles is the same as the number of people, so for 8 people, 10 was a mistake, but the answer for 12 is D)12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of bottles per person, but that would be 10/8 = 1.25, but the options don't have that. \n\nHmm. Since I have to choose an option, and the closest is 14 (E), perhaps that's the intended answer. Because the difference between people and bottles was +2, so adding 2 again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a proportion where the number of bottles is proportional to the number of people, but using a different setup. Like 10/8 = x/12 \u2192 x= (10*12)/8 = 15. But since that's not an option, maybe the question expects a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not proportional, but the number of bottles increases by 2.5 for every 2 people. Wait, 8 people to 10 bottles, so 2 people added would be 5 more bottles? \n\nWait, maybe the question is expecting that the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people, so the ratio is 10/8, so for 12 people, it's 10/8 *12 =15, but since 15 isn't there, maybe the answer is E)14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed to have the answer E)14 by assuming that the original was 10 for 8, so 1 per person plus 2 extra. So for 12, it's 12 +2 =14. \n\nI think this might be the case. The question might be testing the idea that you add a certain number of extra bottles. Like, 2 extra bottles over the number of people. So 8 people: 8+2=10. 12 people:12+2=14. \n\nIn that case, the answer would be E)14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that since 8 people need 10 bottles, each person gets 1 bottle, and there are 2 extra. So for 12, it would be 12 +2 =14. \n\nYes, that seems plausible. Since that approach would give an answer that is among the options. \n\nTherefore, I think the intended answer is E)14.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many bottles Jill needs for 12 people, we first calculate the soda-to-people ratio from the original scenario: 10 bottles for 8 people gives a rate of \\( \\frac{10}{8} = 1.25 \\) bottles per person. Multiplying this rate by 12 people yields \\( 1.25 \\times 12 = 15 \\) bottles. However, since 15 is not an option, we consider alternative approaches. \n\nAnother interpretation suggests Jill adds 2 extra bottles to the number of attendees. For 8 people, this gives \\( 8 + 2 = 10 \\) bottles. Applying the same logic for 12 people: \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\). This matches option E, which is the closest valid answer given the choices. \n\nAnswer: E",

Let me try again. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25. 1.25 multiplied by 12: 12 times 1 is 12, 12 times 0.25 is 3, so total 15. Yep, same as before. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects that the number of bottles is directly proportional but uses a different method. Maybe it's like, for 8 people, 10 bottles. So per person, it's 10/8 = 1.25. So for 12, it's 1.25*12. But maybe they want it rounded down to 12? But that would be 12, which is D. But that would mean she's providing less soda per person, which might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is 12 because she's just buying one per person. But the original had 8 people and 10 bottles, which is 2 extra. So perhaps she adds 2 extra bottles regardless of the number of people? Like 8 people had 10, so 2 extra. So for 12 people, it's 12 +2 =14? That would be E)14. \n\nAh! That's a possibility. Maybe she buys 2 extra regardless of the number of people. So the formula would be (number of people) + 2. So for 8, that gives 10. For 12, that gives 14. So the answer would be E)14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the extra is proportional? Like, 10 is 8 plus 25%. So 12 plus 25% would be 15 again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the ratio between people and bottles is 4:5 (since 8:10 reduces to 4:5). So for 12 people, set up 4/5 = 12/x \u2192 x=15. \n\nHmm. Since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the question expects that extra 2 bottles. So 12 +2=14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed to test unit rate, and since 10 bottles for 8 people is 1.25 per person, and since you can't have a fraction of a bottle, she has to round up. So 12 people would need 15 bottles. But since that's not an option, perhaps the closest lower number is 14? But that would mean 14/12 is about 1.16 per person. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting a direct proportion but using whole numbers. Let's see: 8 people \u219210 bottles. So, how many for 12? Let me set up a proportion: 8/10 = 12/x. Wait, that would give x= (10*12)/8= 15. Same answer. \n\nHmm. Since 15 is not an option, maybe there's another way. Maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is 12, assuming that each person gets one bottle. But the original had 8 people and 10 bottles. So maybe the 2 extra were for the host, and now with more people, she adds another 2? 12 +2=14. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is a rate problem where she buys soda for the party, and the number of bottles is proportional to the number of people, but the options given are wrong. But that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. The question says: \"If Jill needed to buy 10 bottles of soda for a party in which 8 people attended, how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\" \n\nHmm. Maybe the question is implying that the number of bottles needed is the same as the number of people, but in the first case, she bought 10 for 8, which might have been a mistake. But the question is asking for the correct number for 12. So the correct number would be 12. But that would mean she overbought before. But the question says \"needed to buy\"\u2014so perhaps she needed 10 for 8, implying that's the correct amount, so for 12, it's more. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the number of bottles increases by the same difference. The first time, 8 people, 10 bottles. The difference between 12 and 8 is 4. So adding 4 to the original 10 gives 14? That would be E. \n\nWait, that approach would be: the number of people increased by 4 (from 8 to 12), so the number of bottles increases by 4 as well, so 10+4=14. But that would be linear increase, but the ratio approach would be different. \n\nHmm, but why would that be the case? That's assuming that each additional person requires one more bottle. But the original had 8 people needing 10, so that would be 2 extra bottles for 8 people. If each person after the first 8 requires 1 bottle, but that might not make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the difference between the number of people and the bottles is constant. 8 people had 10 bottles, so the difference is 2. So for 12 people, bottles would be 12 +2 =14. That would be E. \n\nAh! That might be the logic here. The difference between people and bottles is 2. So 8 people, 10 bottles (difference +2). So for 12 people, bottles would be 12 +2 =14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original had 2 extra bottles. So she always adds 2. So for any number of people, it's (number of people) + 2. So 8+2=10, 12+2=14. \n\nThat would fit the given options. \n\nSo perhaps that's the correct approach here. The problem is probably testing the understanding of ratios but maybe in a different way. Since 10 bottles for 8 people gives a per person rate of 1.25, but since you can't have a fraction, perhaps she rounds up. But if you have to provide whole bottles, then 12 people would need 15. But since that's not an option, the next best is 14. Alternatively, maybe she just adds 2 extra bottles regardless of the number of people. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is simpler than I'm making it. Like, maybe it's a direct proportion but using a different method. Let me see:\n\nThe ratio of people is 8 to 12, which is 2:3. So the number of bottles would be (3/2)*10 = 15. Again, same result. \n\nHmm. Since the answer options don't have 15, I'm starting to think that maybe the question expects a different approach, perhaps a simple proportional reasoning where 8 people need 10, so 1 person needs 10/8, then 12 people need (10/8)*12 =15. But since that's not an option, maybe the options are wrong. But that can't be. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is 12. Because she needed 10 for 8 people, so maybe 1 per person plus 2 extra, so for 12, it would be 12 + 2 =14. That would be E. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that the number of bottles increases by the same ratio as the people. The number of people increased by 50% (from 8 to 12 is an increase of 4, which is 50% of 8). So the bottles also increase by 50% of 10, which is 5, so 15. Again, same answer. \n\nHmm. Since the options don't have 15, but 14 is there, perhaps the question is expecting rounding down to the nearest whole number, even though that would mean less soda. But that seems odd. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me check again. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25. 1.25 times 12: 12*1 is 12, 12*0.25 is 3, so total is 15. That's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is not assuming that each person drinks the same amount. Maybe the 10 bottles were for the entire party, and she just needs the same amount regardless of the number of people. But that would mean 10 bottles for 12 people, so option C)10. But that doesn't make sense because the question says \"for a party in which 12 people are attending\", implying that more people would need more soda. \n\nHmm. Maybe the options are wrong, but that's not likely. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a unit rate problem but using a different method. Let me think differently. \n\nSuppose that the 10 bottles were enough for 8 people, so the number of people per bottle is 8/10 = 0.8 people per bottle. So for 12 people, you need 12 / 0.8 = 15 bottles. Again, same number. \n\nHmm. This is frustrating. Since the options don't have 15, but the question is presented, maybe there's an error in the question's options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps I need to pick the closest one. But 15 is closer to 14 than 12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the question is expecting a simple ratio of 8:10 simplifies to 4:5, so for 12 people, which is 3 times 4, the bottles would be 3 times 5, which is 15. \n\nWait, but the options are given, so maybe the question had a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting that the number of bottles is the same as the number of people, so for 8 people, 10 was a mistake, but the answer for 12 is D)12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the number of bottles per person, but that would be 10/8 = 1.25, but the options don't have that. \n\nHmm. Since I have to choose an option, and the closest is 14 (E), perhaps that's the intended answer. Because the difference between people and bottles was +2, so adding 2 again. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a proportion where the number of bottles is proportional to the number of people, but using a different setup. Like 10/8 = x/12 \u2192 x= (10*12)/8 = 15. But since that's not an option, maybe the question expects a different approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is not proportional, but the number of bottles increases by 2.5 for every 2 people. Wait, 8 people to 10 bottles, so 2 people added would be 5 more bottles? \n\nWait, maybe the question is expecting that the number of bottles is directly proportional to the number of people, so the ratio is 10/8, so for 12 people, it's 10/8 *12 =15, but since 15 isn't there, maybe the answer is E)14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is designed to have the answer E)14 by assuming that the original was 10 for 8, so 1 per person plus 2 extra. So for 12, it's 12 +2 =14. \n\nI think this might be the case. The question might be testing the idea that you add a certain number of extra bottles. Like, 2 extra bottles over the number of people. So 8 people: 8+2=10. 12 people:12+2=14. \n\nIn that case, the answer would be E)14. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that since 8 people need 10 bottles, each person gets 1 bottle, and there are 2 extra. So for 12, it would be 12 +2 =14. \n\nYes, that seems plausible. Since that approach would give an answer that is among the options. \n\nTherefore, I think the intended answer is E)14.\n\n\nTo determine how many bottles Jill needs for 12 people, we first calculate the soda-to-people ratio from the original scenario: 10 bottles for 8 people gives a rate of \\( \\frac{10}{8} = 1.25 \\) bottles per person. Multiplying this rate by 12 people yields \\( 1.25 \\times 12 = 15 \\) bottles. However, since 15 is not an option, we consider alternative approaches. \n\nAnother interpretation suggests Jill adds 2 extra bottles to the number of attendees. For 8 people, this gives \\( 8 + 2 = 10 \\) bottles. Applying the same logic for 12 people: \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\). This matches option E, which is the closest valid answer given the choices. \n\nAnswer: E",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about figuring out how many bottles of soda Jill needs to buy when there are 12 people instead of 8. The original scenario was 10 bottles for 8 people. Hmm, so I guess this is a proportion problem?\n\nWait, right. The question is probably assuming that the number of soda bottles is proportional to the number of people. So like, if 8 people need 10 bottles, then per person it's 10 divided by 8. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 8 is 1.25 bottles per person. \n\nSo for 12 people, you'd multiply 1.25 by 12. Let me do that math. 1.25 times 12. Well, 1 times 12 is 12, and 0.25 times 12 is 3. So adding those together gives 15? Wait, that's 15. But the options don't have 15. Wait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. Oh, so 15 isn't an option. Hmm, maybe I did something wrong here.\n\nWait, maybe the question is not a direct proportion? Or maybe I misunderstood the problem. Let me read it again. The question says if Jill needed 10 bottles for 8 people, how many for 12? The options given are up to 14. Hmm. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me check again. \n\nOriginal ratio is 10 bottles for 8 people. So per person, that's 10/8 = 1.25, right. So 12 people would be 1.25 * 12. Let me calculate that again. 12 times 1 is 12, 12 times 0.25 is 3. Total 15. Oh, but 15 isn't there. The closest higher option is E)14. But that's not matching. Hmm. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is expecting that each person drinks the same number of bottles as before, but maybe it's rounded? Like maybe it's per person 1 bottle each, so 12 would be 12, but then why was it 10 for 8? That doesn't add up. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where it's not proportional. Like maybe the 10 bottles were for 8 people, so per person it's 1.25, but since you can't buy a fraction of a bottle, you have to round up. But then 12 people would need 15, but since that's not an option, perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the number of people increased by a certain ratio, so the bottles should be scaled by the same. Let's see. 8 to 12 is multiplying by 1.5. So 10 times 1.5 is 15. Again, same problem. The options don't have that. Wait, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is D)12, thinking that each person gets one bottle? But the original was 10 for 8, which would mean 1.25 each. But maybe the question is expecting a proportional reasoning where it's per head, but rounded down? \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a ratio problem where you set up a proportion. Let me think again. Let's set up the proportion. Let x be the number of bottles needed for 12 people. \n\nSo, 10 bottles / 8 people = x bottles / 12 people. Cross-multiplying gives 8x = 120, so x=15. But again, that's not an option. The options given are E)14, which is 1 less. Maybe the question expects rounding down? But that would be 14.25 rounded to 14? Wait, 10/8 is 1.25 per person. 12 times 1.25 is 15. So if you can't have a fraction of a bottle, maybe you round to the nearest whole number. But 15 isn't an option. \n\nHmm, perhaps there's an error in the problem? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read again. The question says \"how many bottles of soda will she need to buy for a party in which 12 people are attending?\" Maybe the question assumes that each person drinks the same number of bottles as in the original, but the original might have been an exact number. Wait, 10 bottles for 8 people. Maybe that's 1 bottle per person plus 2 extra. So if you have 12 people, that would be 12 + 2 =14? Oh! That might be the case. Like, maybe the 10 is 8 people plus 2 extra, so per person 1 bottle plus 2 extra. So for 12, 12 +2 would be 14. So the answer would be E)14. That makes sense now. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rate problem where the number of people increased by 50%, so 1.5 times, so 10 times 1.5 is 15, but since you can't buy 15, maybe the answer expects rounding down to 14? But that seems odd. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the original was exactly 1.25 per person, but since you can't buy a quarter, maybe they rounded down each person's share. But that complicates it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a proportion but they expect the answer to be 15 but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, maybe the question is not proportional. Maybe the 10 bottles were for the party, not per person. Like maybe the number of people doesn't directly correlate. But that's not logical. The question is probably expecting a proportional reasoning. Since the options don't have 15, but the closest is E)14, maybe there's an error in the options. Wait, but maybe the original problem was that Jill needed 10 for 8 people, so maybe each person had 1.25, but she can't buy partial bottles, so she bought 10. So for 12 people, she would need 12 *1.25 =15, but since you can't buy 15, maybe she rounds up to 15, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is E)14, which is the closest? But that's not exact. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a ratio problem where it's set up as 10:8 = x:12. So cross multiply: 8x = 120 \u2192 x=15. Since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the problem expects a different approach. Wait, maybe it's a unit rate where you find how much per person and then multiply. But same result. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where the answer is D)12, assuming that each person gets exactly one bottle, but then why was it 10 for 8? Unless there was some leftover. Maybe the question is saying that 10 bottles were sufficient for 8 people, so maybe 1.25 per person is okay, but for 12, 12 would be sufficient if each takes 1 bottle. So maybe the answer is D)12? But that would mean that the original 10 was more than enough. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting that the number of people increased by 4 (from 8 to 12 is an increase of 4), so adding 5 more bottles (since 10 for 8, so per 2 people, 2.5 bottles? Not sure). Alternatively, the difference between 8 and 12 is 4, so adding 4 people, so how many more bottles? The original 8 people needed 10, so per person 1.25. So 4 more people would need 5 more, totaling 15. Still not there. \n\nWait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. The only possible answers close are E)14. Maybe the question expects that you round down to the nearest whole number. 12*1.25=15, but maybe they subtract a bottle? Like 15-1=14? That might be a stretch, but perhaps that's the case. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way of calculating. Let me try fractions. 10/8 = 5/4 per person. So for 12 people, that's 5/4 *12= (5*12)/4 =60/4=15. Again, same answer. \n\nHmm. Since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the question has a typo, but given the options provided, maybe the intended answer is E)14? Or maybe I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the question is asking how many additional bottles needed? But no, the question says \"how many bottles to buy for 12 people\", not additional. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original 10 bottles were for the entire party, regardless of the number of people. Like maybe it's a fixed number. But that doesn't make sense. The question must be assuming proportionality. Since the options don't have 15, perhaps the correct answer is E)14, which is the closest. Alternatively, maybe the question expects to use ratios but simplifying fractions. Let me think. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that it's 10 bottles for 8 people, so the ratio is 5:4 (divided by 2). So for 12 people, which is 3 times 4, so 5*3=15. Again, same. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to set up a proportion and solve, but the answer options are wrong? Or maybe I made a mistake. Let me see the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. So the possible answers. Since 15 is not there, but the question must have an answer. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, maybe the question is saying that Jill needed to buy 10 bottles for a party of 8 people, so maybe each person drinks 1 bottle, and there were 2 extra. So for 12 people, she would need 12 +2 =14. That would be option E. So that's the reasoning. So that's probably the right way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 10 is 8 people's consumption plus 2, so for each additional person, you add 1 bottle. So 8 people: 10. 12 is 4 more people, so 10+4=14. That would be E. \n\nAh, that makes sense. So perhaps the question is implying that there are 2 extra bottles for 8 people, so per person, maybe 1 bottle plus 2 extra. So for 12 people, 12 plus 2 would be 14. Therefore, the answer is E. \n\nYes, that seems to fit. So I think the answer is E)14.\n",

Not sure). Alternatively, the difference between 8 and 12 is 4, so adding 4 people, so how many more bottles? The original 8 people needed 10, so per person 1.25. So 4 more people would need 5 more, totaling 15. Still not there. \n\nWait, the options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. The only possible answers close are E)14. Maybe the question expects that you round down to the nearest whole number. 12*1.25=15, but maybe they subtract a bottle? Like 15-1=14? That might be a stretch, but perhaps that's the case. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way of calculating. Let me try fractions. 10/8 = 5/4 per person. So for 12 people, that's 5/4 *12= (5*12)/4 =60/4=15. Again, same answer. \n\nHmm. Since 15 isn't an option, perhaps the question has a typo, but given the options provided, maybe the intended answer is E)14? Or maybe I'm missing something. Wait, maybe the question is asking how many additional bottles needed? But no, the question says \"how many bottles to buy for 12 people\", not additional. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the original 10 bottles were for the entire party, regardless of the number of people. Like maybe it's a fixed number. But that doesn't make sense. The question must be assuming proportionality. Since the options don't have 15, perhaps the correct answer is E)14, which is the closest. Alternatively, maybe the question expects to use ratios but simplifying fractions. Let me think. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that it's 10 bottles for 8 people, so the ratio is 5:4 (divided by 2). So for 12 people, which is 3 times 4, so 5*3=15. Again, same. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is expecting to set up a proportion and solve, but the answer options are wrong? Or maybe I made a mistake. Let me see the options again. The options are A)6, B)8, C)10, D)12, E)14. So the possible answers. Since 15 is not there, but the question must have an answer. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. \n\nWait, maybe the question is saying that Jill needed to buy 10 bottles for a party of 8 people, so maybe each person drinks 1 bottle, and there were 2 extra. So for 12 people, she would need 12 +2 =14. That would be option E. So that's the reasoning. So that's probably the right way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 10 is 8 people's consumption plus 2, so for each additional person, you add 1 bottle. So 8 people: 10. 12 is 4 more people, so 10+4=14. That would be E. \n\nAh, that makes sense. So perhaps the question is implying that there are 2 extra bottles for 8 people, so per person, maybe 1 bottle plus 2 extra. So for 12 people, 12 plus 2 would be 14. Therefore, the answer is E. \n\nYes, that seems to fit. So I think the answer is E)14.\n\n\nTo determine how many bottles Jill needs for 12 people, we first calculate the ratio from the original scenario: 10 bottles for 8 people gives \\( \\frac{10}{8} = 1.25 \\) bottles per person. For 12 people, this would be \\( 1.25 \\times 12 = 15 \\). However, 15 is not an option. \n\nConsidering the problem might involve rounding or a different approach, we notice that 10 bottles for 8 people could imply 1 bottle per person plus 2 extra. Extending this logic, for 12 people, this would be \\( 12 + 2 = 14 \\), matching option E. \n\nThus, the answer is **E)14**.\n\nAnswer: E",
