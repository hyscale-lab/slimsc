      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about figuring out how long it takes the worker to cycle to work instead of driving. Let me read it again. The driving time is 9 minutes at 20 km/h, and cycling is at 6 km/h. They want the cycling time. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I remember that time equals distance divided by speed. Wait, right, so I need to find the distance first using the driving details. Because the distance from home to work is the same whether driving or cycling. \n\nSo, when driving, the worker takes 9 minutes at 20 km/h. But wait, the speed is in km per hour and the time is in minutes. I should convert the time to hours to match the units. Let's see, 9 minutes is 9/60 hours, which is 0.15 hours. \n\nCalculating the distance: distance = speed \u00d7 time. So driving distance is 20 km/h multiplied by 0.15 hours. Let me do that math. 20 times 0.15 equals 3. So the distance is 3 kilometers. \n\nNow, for cycling, the speed is 6 km/h. The distance is still 3 km. So time taken would be distance divided by speed. That's 3 km divided by 6 km/h. That equals 0.5 hours. Oh wait, 0.5 hours is 30 minutes. Wait, but let me check the options. Option A is 30. So that would be the answer? But hold on, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me verify each step again. \n\nFirst step: converting 9 minutes to hours. 9 divided by 60 is indeed 0.15 hours. \n\n20 km/h multiplied by 0.15 hours: 20 * 0.15 = 3 km. That seems right. \n\nThen cycling: 3 km divided by 6 km/h. 3/6 is 0.5 hours. 0.5 times 60 minutes is 30 minutes. So yes, 30 minutes. Option A. \n\nBut wait, the options given include 30 as A, which would be the answer. Let me check if there's a trick here. Maybe they expect something else? Like, maybe the question is in minutes, and did I mix up anything?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should do it another way. Let's see, another approach. \n\nThe time taken is inversely proportional to the speed if the distance is the same. So since the speed is going down from 20 to 6, the time should increase by a factor of 20/6. \n\nOriginal time is 9 minutes. So new time is 9 * (20/6)? Wait, no, wait. Wait, time is inversely proportional to speed. So if speed decreases, time increases. So the ratio would be (original speed)/(new speed) multiplied by original time. \n\nWait the formula is: T1 * S2 = T2 * S1, because distance is same. So T2 = (T1 * S1)/S2. Wait, let me think again. \n\nDistance = S1*T1 (in hours). So S1 * T1 (in hours) = S2 * T2 (in hours). \n\nTherefore, T2 = (S1 / S2) * T1. \n\nSo substituting, S1 is 20, S2 is 6, T1 is 9 minutes. \n\nWait but units here: Since S1 and S2 are both in km per hour, the time in hours would work. But since T1 is in minutes, maybe better to convert everything to hours. Let me try again. \n\nOriginal time in hours: 9/60 = 0.15 hours. \n\nDistance is 20 * 0.15 = 3 km, same as before. \n\nThen cycling time is 3 /6 = 0.5 hours, which is 30 minutes. So the same answer. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be A)30. But the options have A as 30, so that's correct. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options given are A)30, B)32, C)35, D)36, E)40. So yes, 30 is an option. \n\nHmm. Maybe I'm overcomplicating, but I think the correct answer is A. So the answer is A.\n",

Hmm, first, I remember that time, speed, and distance are all related by the formula: distance equals speed multiplied by time. Oh right, so maybe I need to find the distance first using the driving information, then use that distance to find the cycling time.\n\nAlright, let's start with the driving part. The worker drives at 20 km/h and takes 9 minutes. Wait a second, the time is in minutes but the speed is in hours. I need to convert that time to hours to match the units. So 9 minutes is 9/60 hours, which simplifies to 0.15 hours. \n\nCalculating the distance then: 20 km/h multiplied by 0.15 hours. Let's do that math. 20 * 0.15 equals 3. So the distance from home to work is 3 kilometers. Got that part.\n\nNow, the cycling speed is 6 km/h. We need to find the time it takes to cover 3 km at that speed. Using the same formula rearranged: time equals distance divided by speed. So 3 km divided by 6 km/h. That would be 0.5 hours. But the question asks for the time in minutes, so I need to convert 0.5 hours back to minutes. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 0.5 * 60 is 30 minutes. \n\nWait, but let me double-check the calculations. Let's see, driving time: 9 minutes at 20 km/h. Alternatively, maybe another way to think is, since speed and time are inversely proportional when distance is constant. Because the distance doesn't change, right? So if the speed decreases, the time increases. \n\nThe original speed is 20, new speed is 6. The ratio of speeds is 20:6, which simplifies to 10:3. Since time is inversely proportional, the ratio of times would be 3:10. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The time taken would be inversely proportional to the speed. So if the speed is multiplied by a factor, time is divided by that factor. \n\nSo original time is 9 minutes at 20 km/h. The new speed is 6 km/h, which is 6/20 = 3/10 of the original speed. So the time should be original time divided by (3/10), which is the same as multiplying by 10/3. So 9 * (10/3) equals 30. Oh, same answer as before. So that confirms it. \n\nHmm, so the answer should be 30 minutes, which is option A. Let me check the options again. The options are A)30, B)32, C)35, D)36, E)40. Yep, 30 is option A. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion somewhere? Let me go through the first method again. \n\nOriginal time driving: 9 minutes. Convert to hours: 9/60 = 0.15 hours. Distance is 20 * 0.15 = 3 km. Correct. Then cycling at 6 km/h: time is 3/6 = 0.5 hours. 0.5 *60 = 30 minutes. Yep, that's consistent.
