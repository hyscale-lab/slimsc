      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the total bus fare for 4 adults and 3 children from Ranchi to Patna. Hmm, the adult fare is given as Rs. 140. The child fare is half of that, right?\n\nSo first, I need to figure out the child's fare. Half of 140 would be 70. So each child pays 70. \n\nNow, for four adults, that's 4 multiplied by 140. Let me calculate that. 4 times 100 is 400, and 4 times 40 is 160, so adding those together gives 560. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 140 times 4. Let me do that again. 140 plus 140 is 280 for two adults, so times 4 would be 280*2 = 560. Yeah, that's right. So 4 adults cost 560.\n\nThen the children. Three children at 70 each. So 3 times 70. 70 times 3 is 210. Because 70 plus 70 is 140, plus another 70 is 210. \n\nNow add the two totals together. 560 plus 210. Let's see: 500 + 200 is 700, and 60 +10 is 70. So 700 +70 is 770. Wait, that's 770? But looking at the options, option E is 770. Hmm, but let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the child's fare. The problem says the child's fare is half of the adult. So 140 divided by 2 is indeed 70. So that's correct. \n\nSo 4 adults: 4\u00d7140=560. 3 children: 3\u00d770=210. Total is 560 + 210 = 770. So the answer should be E) Rs.770. \n\nWait but looking at the options again, option C is 700. Did I miscalculate something? Let me check again. Oh wait, maybe I added wrong. 560 plus 210. 560 + 200 is 760, plus 10 is 770. Yeah that's right. So the correct answer must be E. But let me check the options again. The options are A)666, B)670, C)700, D)570, E)770. So yes, E is there. Hmm, so the answer should be E. But wait, maybe I misread the question? Let me re-read the question.\n\nThe question says \"total bus fare of 4 adults and 3 children between the same places.\" Yep. So the calculation seems right. So the correct answer is E. But wait, why is option C 700? Maybe a common mistake? Like if someone thought child is half of adult's total? Or maybe I made a mistake. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick question where child is half of the adult's fare, so 140/2 is 70. So 4 adults:4\u00d7140=560, 3 children: 3\u00d770=210. Total is 560+210=770. So yes, E is the correct answer. So the answer must be E.\n",
