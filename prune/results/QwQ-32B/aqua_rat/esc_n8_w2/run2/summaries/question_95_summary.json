      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this newspaper cost problem. Hmm. The question is about how many newspapers the hotel buys on Monday. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nSo, the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 on other days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days. Wait, the rest of the days\u2014does that mean each day from Monday to Saturday they order the same number? I think so. The problem probably assumes that the number of papers bought on each non-Sunday day is the same. Because otherwise, the problem might be more complicated, but since the options are given, I can proceed with that assumption.\n\nThe total weekly cost is $210. Need to find how many they buy on Monday, which would be the same as any other weekday except Sunday. Let me set up variables.\n\nLet me denote the number of papers bought on a regular day (Monday-Saturday) as x. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice as many as the rest of the days. Wait, wait, the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Hmm, does that mean that Sunday's order is twice the number they buy on each other day? Or is it twice the total of the other days combined?\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous here. Let me parse the sentence again. The hotel \"orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" The phrase \"the rest of the days\" might refer to each of the other days. So, perhaps on each non-Sunday day, they buy x papers, and on Sunday they buy 2x. Alternatively, maybe \"the rest of the days of the week\" refers to the total for all other days. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the way it's phrased: \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The \"rest of the days\" would be the other six days, so perhaps the total for those days. Wait, but that might not make sense. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem means that the number of papers on Sunday is twice the number they buy on any other single day. Because if \"the rest of the days\" is plural, then maybe it's the average per day? Hmm, this is a bit confusing.\n\nWait, maybe let me consider the problem's possible interpretations. Let me try both possibilities and see which gives an answer in the options.\n\nFirst interpretation: Suppose that on each non-Sunday day, the hotel buys x papers. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice as many as any of those days, so Sunday's number is 2x. Then, the total for the week would be Sunday's papers plus the sum of the other six days. Let's see:\n\nTotal cost would be (Sunday papers * $4) + (other days total * $1). The number of papers on Sunday is 2x. The other days (Monday to Saturday) are 6 days, each with x papers, so total for those is 6x. So total cost is (2x *4) + (6x *1) = 8x +6x=14x. According to the problem, this equals $210. So 14x=210 \u2192 x=15. Then Monday's papers are x, so 15. Which is option A. But let me check if that's the case.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". Wait, the wording might mean that the number on Sunday is twice the number on the other days combined. Wait, that's another possible interpretation. Let me parse again.\n\nThe problem states: \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The \"rest of the days of the week\" would refer to all the other days. So the total number of papers ordered on Sunday is twice the total number ordered on the other days. So Sunday = 2*(Monday to Saturday total). \n\nIn that case, let me define variables again. Let me let x be the number of papers bought each day from Monday to Saturday. So each of those 6 days is x. Then total for those days is 6x. Then Sunday's order is 2*(6x) = 12x. \n\nNow, the cost would be:\n\nSunday's cost: 12x * $4 = 48x\n\nOther days: 6x * $1 = 6x\n\nTotal cost: 48x +6x =54x =210 \u2192 54x=210 \u2192 x=210/54 \u2248 3.888... which is not an integer, but the answer options are all integers. So that can't be right. So that interpretation must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so that suggests that the first interpretation was better, where Sunday's order is twice the number of each of the other days. So each non-sunday day is x, so Sunday is 2x. Then total papers:\n\nSunday: 2x\n\nOther days: 6x (since 6 days each x)\n\nTotal cost: (2x)*4 + (6x)*1 = 8x +6x =14x =210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday's papers are x, so 15, which is option A. But the options include 15 (A) and 30 (B). Wait, but let me check if the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\". Wait, maybe the wording is that \"twice as many on Sunday as it does [on] the rest of the days\". The wording is ambiguous. Because \"the rest of the days of the week\" could be per day or total.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the number of papers ordered on Sunday is twice the number ordered on any other day. So Sunday is 2x, and each of the other days is x, so that's the first case, leading to x=15. So Monday would be 15 (A). But the options have A as 15, which is possible. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, but let me read again the problem statement exactly:\n\n\"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\".\n\nHmm. The phrasing \"twice as many ... as it does the rest of the days\" \u2014 \"the rest of the days\" is plural, so the comparison is between Sunday's number and the total of all the other days. Because \"the rest of the days of the week\" refers to all the other days collectively. So for example, if on the other days they buy 10 each, total 60, then Sunday would be 120. That's the second interpretation. But that led to x=210/54 \u22483.88, which is not an integer. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem's wording is that the number on Sunday is twice the number ordered on each of the other days. So each non-sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. Then the total for the other days is 6x, and Sunday is 2x. Then total cost is 2x*4 +6x*1=8x+6x=14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday would be 15. Which is option A. But the options have B)30. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says that the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So Sunday is twice any other day. That would fit the first scenario. So then answer is 15, which is option A. But let me check the options again. The options are A)15, B)30, etc. Hmm, but maybe I need to consider that the hotel orders on Sunday twice as many as the number it orders on the other days combined. Wait, that would be the second interpretation, but that led to fractional x. Unless I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, let's try that again. Let me suppose that \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014so Sunday's papers = 2*(sum of all other days' papers). Let me let x be the number of papers ordered each day from Monday to Saturday. So total other days: 6x. Then Sunday is 2*(6x) =12x.\n\nTotal cost:\n\nSunday: 12x *4 =48x\n\nOther days:6x *1=6x\n\nTotal cost:48x +6x =54x =210 \u2192 x=210/54 = 3.888... Not an integer, which is a problem. Since the number of papers must be whole numbers, that can't be. So this suggests that this interpretation is wrong. Therefore the first interpretation must be correct, leading to x=15. So Monday's papers would be 15, which is answer A. But wait, the options include 15 as A, so that's possible. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\"\u2014meaning that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. So each non-sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. Then total cost is (2x)*4 + (6x)*1 = 8x +6x =14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday's papers are 15. So A is correct. But why is option B 30 there? Maybe I made a mistake in reading the question.\n\nWait another possibility: maybe the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So Sunday's number is 2x, and the other days are x each. Then the total for the week would be 2x (Sunday) plus 6x (other days) =8x papers. But the cost is 2x*4 (Sunday cost) plus 6x*1 (other days). So that's correct. 8x+6x? Wait, no. Wait cost: Sunday's cost is 4 per paper, so 2x *4 =8x. The other days' total cost is 6x *1 =6x. So total cost is 14x=210, so x is 15. So Monday's papers are 15. So answer A. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing a step. Let me think again. Maybe the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\"\u2014so the total on Sunday is twice the total of the other days. So total Sunday papers = 2*(total of Monday-Saturday). Let me try this again with variables:\n\nLet me let the total papers from Monday to Saturday be Y. Then Sunday's papers are 2Y. \n\nTotal cost would be (2Y)*4 + Y*1 = 8Y + Y =9Y =210? \n\nWait 9Y =210 \u2192 Y=210/9 \u224823.333. Not integer. Hmm, again fractional. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does each of the other days. So each non-sunday day is x, so Sunday is 2x. Then total papers:\n\nSunday: 2x, others 6x, total cost 2x*4 +6x*1 = 8x +6x=14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday's x is 15. So answer A.\n\nBut then why is option B 30? Maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait the question says \"how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\" So if x is the number bought on each non-sunday day, then Monday's is x, so that would be 15, which is A. But maybe the problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days combined. But that gives fractional numbers. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So each non-sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. Then the calculation is correct. So the answer is A)15. But why is there an option B)30? Let me see if the problem could be interpreted differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"rest of the days of the week\" refers to each day except Sunday, but the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as the average of the other days. Wait, but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hotel orders on each of the other days (Monday to Saturday) twice the number as Sunday. Wait, but that would reverse the numbers, but the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as the rest of the days\".\n\nHmm, maybe I made an error in the total cost calculation. Let me recalculate with x=15:\n\nSunday papers: 2x =30. So cost 30*4 =120.\n\nOther days: 6x =90 papers. Cost 90*1=90. Total 210. That's correct. 120+90=210. So yes. So that works. So Monday's papers are x=15, so answer A.\n\nBut then why is B an option? Let me check again the problem's wording once more.\n\n\"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\".\n\nAh! Wait, maybe \"the rest of the days of the week\" refers to each day, but in total. Like, the total for the other days. Because \"the rest of the days of the week\" is plural, so the total over those days. So Sunday's number is twice the total of all the other days. So that would be the second interpretation. But that leads to a fractional answer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014meaning that the Sunday's number is twice the number ordered on each of the other days. So Sunday is 2x, others are x each. That works. So answer A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem's cost. Wait, Sunday is $4, others are $1. Yes, that's correct. So the calculation holds.\n\nHmm. The problem must be A. But let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)15\n\nB)30\n\nC)45\n\nD)60\n\nE)75\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Wait, the rest of the days of the week are 6 days. So if the hotel orders x papers each day from Monday to Saturday, that's 6 days. So Sunday is 2x. So total cost is (2x)*4 + (6x)*1. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\"\u2014meaning that the number on Sunday is twice the number ordered on each of the other days. So Sunday is 2x, each other day is x. So the total for the other days is 6x. So the math checks out. \n\nHmm. Then the answer is A)15. So why is B)30 an option? Let me see if perhaps the question is asking for the total on Sunday, which would be 30 (2x where x=15). But the question is about Monday. So that would be 15. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014meaning that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. Wait, but then the rest of the days are plural, so maybe the average of the other days. Wait, but the problem states \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014so comparing Sunday's count to the count of all the other days combined. That would mean Sunday is 2*(sum of others). But that led to a fraction. So that can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is in another way. Let me try another approach. Let me let the number of papers bought on each non-Sunday day be x. Then Sunday's order is 2x. \n\nTotal cost:\n\nSunday cost: 2x *4 =8x\n\nOther days: 6 days *x *1=6x\n\nTotal cost:8x +6x =14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday is x=15, so A.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A)15. But let me check again. The problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The \"rest of the days of the week\" refers to all the other days. So perhaps the problem is that the Sunday's number is twice the number of each of the other days. Because if \"the rest of the days\" are the other days, then per day. So if each of the other days is x, then Sunday is 2x. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total on Sunday is twice the total on all other days. Let me try that again with variables. Let me call the total number of papers on the other days (Monday-Saturday) as Y. Then Sunday is 2Y. \n\nTotal cost: (2Y)*4 + Y*1 = 8Y + Y =9Y =210 \u2192 Y=23.333, which is not integer. So that can't be. \n\nTherefore, the first interpretation must be correct. The answer is 15, option A. \n\nWait but maybe I made a mistake in the problem's phrasing. Let me read once more:\n\n\"A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\"\n\nThe key phrase: \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". \n\nThe wording here is a bit ambiguous. The phrase \"as it does the rest of the days of the week\" could be interpreted as the number on each of the other days. For example, if it had said \"twice as many on Sunday as on any other day\", that would clearly mean each other day. But here, \"the rest of the days\" is plural. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number on Sunday is twice the number ordered on any of the other days. So Sunday's is twice each other day. That would make the first scenario correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the rest of the days of the week\" refers to the total for all the other days. So Sunday is twice that total. But that gives a fractional answer, which can't be. \n\nSince the first interpretation gives an answer that's in the options (A), and the second leads to a fraction, which isn't possible, I think the first interpretation is correct. So the answer is A)15.\n\nBut wait, the options have B as 30. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me see another angle. Suppose that \"the rest of the days\" refers to each day except Sunday, but the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So if each non-sunday day is x, then Sunday is 2x. So then Monday is x, which is 15. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as the total of all other days combined, but that gives a fraction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cost calculation. Let me recheck:\n\nIf Sunday's papers are 2x (where x is Monday's, etc.), then Sunday's cost is 2x *4 =8x. The other days (6 days) are each x, so total cost for other days is 6x *1 =6x. Total cost is 8x +6x =14x =210 \u2192 x=15. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is A. \n\nHmm, I think that must be correct. Maybe the options are right and the answer is A. So I'll go with A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote the number of newspapers bought on each non-Sunday day (Monday to Saturday) as \\( x \\).

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this newspaper cost problem. Hmm. The question is about how many newspapers the hotel buys on Monday.

Maybe I made a mistake in reading the question.\n\nWait another possibility: maybe the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So Sunday's number is 2x, and the other days are x each. Then the total for the week would be 2x (Sunday) plus 6x (other days) =8x papers. But the cost is 2x*4 (Sunday cost) plus 6x*1 (other days). So that's correct. 8x+6x? Wait, no. Wait cost: Sunday's cost is 4 per paper, so 2x *4 =8x. The other days' total cost is 6x *1 =6x. So total cost is 14x=210, so x is 15. So Monday's papers are 15. So answer A. \n\nBut maybe I'm missing a step. Let me think again. Maybe the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\"\u2014so the total on Sunday is twice the total of the other days. So total Sunday papers = 2*(total of Monday-Saturday). Let me try this again with variables:\n\nLet me let the total papers from Monday to Saturday be Y. Then Sunday's papers are 2Y. \n\nTotal cost would be (2Y)*4 + Y*1 = 8Y + Y =9Y =210? \n\nWait 9Y =210 \u2192 Y=210/9 \u224823.333. Not integer. Hmm, again fractional. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does each of the other days. So each non-sunday day is x, so Sunday is 2x. Then total papers:\n\nSunday: 2x, others 6x, total cost 2x*4 +6x*1 = 8x +6x=14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday's x is 15. So answer A.\n\nBut then why is option B 30? Maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, perhaps I misread the question. Let me check again.\n\nWait the question says \"how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\" So if x is the number bought on each non-sunday day, then Monday's is x, so that would be 15, which is A. But maybe the problem says the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days combined. But that gives fractional numbers. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So each non-sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. Then the calculation is correct. So the answer is A)15. But why is there an option B)30? Let me see if the problem could be interpreted differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the \"rest of the days of the week\" refers to each day except Sunday, but the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as the average of the other days. Wait, but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the hotel orders on each of the other days (Monday to Saturday) twice the number as Sunday. Wait, but that would reverse the numbers, but the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as the rest of the days\".\n\nHmm, maybe I made an error in the total cost calculation. Let me recalculate with x=15:\n\nSunday papers: 2x =30. So cost 30*4 =120.\n\nOther days: 6x =90 papers. Cost 90*1=90. Total 210. That's correct. 120+90=210. So yes. So that works. So Monday's papers are x=15, so answer A.\n\nBut then why is B an option? Let me check again the problem's wording once more.\n\n\"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\".\n\nAh! Wait, maybe \"the rest of the days of the week\" refers to each day, but in total. Like, the total for the other days. Because \"the rest of the days of the week\" is plural, so the total over those days. So Sunday's number is twice the total of all the other days. So that would be the second interpretation. But that leads to a fractional answer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014meaning that the Sunday's number is twice the number ordered on each of the other days. So Sunday is 2x, others are x each. That works. So answer A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misread the problem's cost. Wait, Sunday is $4, others are $1. Yes, that's correct. So the calculation holds.\n\nHmm. The problem must be A. But let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)15\n\nB)30\n\nC)45\n\nD)60\n\nE)75\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of days. Wait, the rest of the days of the week are 6 days. So if the hotel orders x papers each day from Monday to Saturday, that's 6 days. So Sunday is 2x. So total cost is (2x)*4 + (6x)*1. \n\nWait, but maybe the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\"\u2014meaning that the number on Sunday is twice the number ordered on each of the other days. So Sunday is 2x, each other day is x. So the total for the other days is 6x. So the math checks out. \n\nHmm. Then the answer is A)15. So why is B)30 an option? Let me see if perhaps the question is asking for the total on Sunday, which would be 30 (2x where x=15). But the question is about Monday. So that would be 15. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014meaning that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. Wait, but then the rest of the days are plural, so maybe the average of the other days. Wait, but the problem states \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014so comparing Sunday's count to the count of all the other days combined. That would mean Sunday is 2*(sum of others). But that led to a fraction. So that can't be. \n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is in another way. Let me try another approach. Let me let the number of papers bought on each non-Sunday day be x. Then Sunday's order is 2x. \n\nTotal cost:\n\nSunday cost: 2x *4 =8x\n\nOther days: 6 days *x *1=6x\n\nTotal cost:8x +6x =14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday is x=15, so A.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A)15. But let me check again. The problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The \"rest of the days of the week\" refers to all the other days. So perhaps the problem is that the Sunday's number is twice the number of each of the other days. Because if \"the rest of the days\" are the other days, then per day. So if each of the other days is x, then Sunday is 2x. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the total on Sunday is twice the total on all other days. Let me try that again with variables. Let me call the total number of papers on the other days (Monday-Saturday) as Y. Then Sunday is 2Y. \n\nTotal cost: (2Y)*4 + Y*1 = 8Y + Y =9Y =210 \u2192 Y=23.333, which is not integer. So that can't be. \n\nTherefore, the first interpretation must be correct. The answer is 15, option A. \n\nWait but maybe I made a mistake in the problem's phrasing. Let me read once more:\n\n\"A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\"\n\nThe key phrase: \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". \n\nThe wording here is a bit ambiguous. The phrase \"as it does the rest of the days of the week\" could be interpreted as the number on each of the other days. For example, if it had said \"twice as many on Sunday as on any other day\", that would clearly mean each other day. But here, \"the rest of the days\" is plural. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the number on Sunday is twice the number ordered on any of the other days. So Sunday's is twice each other day. That would make the first scenario correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe \"the rest of the days of the week\" refers to the total for all the other days. So Sunday is twice that total. But that gives a fractional answer, which can't be. \n\nSince the first interpretation gives an answer that's in the options (A), and the second leads to a fraction, which isn't possible, I think the first interpretation is correct. So the answer is A)15.\n\nBut wait, the options have B as 30. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me see another angle. Suppose that \"the rest of the days\" refers to each day except Sunday, but the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So if each non-sunday day is x, then Sunday is 2x. So then Monday is x, which is 15. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem says the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as the total of all other days combined, but that gives a fraction. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cost calculation. Let me recheck:\n\nIf Sunday's papers are 2x (where x is Monday's, etc.), then Sunday's cost is 2x *4 =8x. The other days (6 days) are each x, so total cost for other days is 6x *1 =6x. Total cost is 8x +6x =14x =210 \u2192 x=15. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the answer is A. \n\nHmm, I think that must be correct. Maybe the options are right and the answer is A. So I'll go with A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote the number of newspapers bought on each non-Sunday day (Monday to Saturday) as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the hotel orders twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on each of the other days, meaning Sunday's newspapers are \\( 2x \\). \n\n**Cost Calculation:**\n- **Sunday's cost:** \\( 2x \\) newspapers at $4 each: \\( 2x \\times 4 = 8x \\)\n- **Other days' cost:** \\( 6 \\) days (Monday to Saturday) at \\( x \\) newspapers each: \\( 6x \\times 1 = 6x \\)\n- **Total weekly cost:** \\( 8x + 6x = 14x \\)\n\nGiven the total weekly cost is $210:\n\\[\n14x = 210 \\implies x = \\frac{210}{14} = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of newspapers bought on Monday (which is \\( x \\)) is **15**. \n\nOther interpretations, such as Sunday's newspapers being twice the total of all other days combined, lead to non-integer results, which are invalid. Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many newspapers the hotel buys on Monday. The problem says the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as the other days. Wait, wait, the wording here is a bit tricky. Let me read that again.\n\n\"A hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Hmm, so does that mean that on each of the other days, they buy a certain number, and on Sunday they buy twice that number? Or is it that the total for Sunday is twice the total of all the other days combined? Wait, probably the first interpretation. Let me parse the sentence again.\n\nThe phrasing is \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Wait, maybe \"the rest of the days\" refers to the average per day? Or maybe the total for the other days? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as: Let the number of papers bought on a non-Sunday day be x. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice that amount, so 2x. But how many days are we talking about here?\n\nWait, the rest of the days of the week. The week has 7 days. So Sunday is one day, and the other six days are Monday to Saturday. So if on each of those six days they buy x papers each, then the total for the other days would be 6x. But the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Wait, that could be ambiguous. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So \"the rest of the days\" would be the other six days. So the number bought on Sunday is twice the number bought on each of the other days? Or twice the total for all other days?\n\nHmm, the wording is ambiguous. Let me think. The phrasing is \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" The structure is \"twice as many [on Sunday] as [on the rest of the days].\" So the comparison is between the Sunday's quantity and the rest of the days. Wait, but \"the rest of the days\" is plural. So perhaps the total for the other days?\n\nWait, maybe the way to interpret this is: Let the number of papers bought on each of the other days (Monday to Saturday) be x per day. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice as many as they do on each of those days. So Sunday's number would be 2x. Alternatively, maybe the total for all non-Sundays is x, so Sunday's is 2x. The problem is a bit unclear. Let me see how to resolve this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that the number of papers bought on Sunday is twice the number bought on any of the other days. So each non-Sunday day has x papers, Sunday has 2x. That would make sense. Let me try that approach first.\n\nAssuming that each non-Sunday day (so Monday to Saturday, 6 days) has x papers each day, then Sunday has 2x. Then total papers per week would be 6x (for the 6 days) plus 2x (Sunday) = 8x papers. But the cost is given as $210. Let's see the cost calculation.\n\nThe cost on Sunday is $4 per paper, so Sunday's cost is 2x * $4. The other days are $1 per paper, so each of those days is x * $1, so 6x * $1. So total cost is (2x *4) + (6x *1) = 8x +6x= 14x. Wait, that's 14x total dollars. And that's equal to $210. So 14x =210 \u2192 x=15. So then, on Monday, which is a non-Sunday day, they buy x papers, which would be 15. Then the answer would be A)15. But the options have 15 as A and 30 as B. Hmm. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe my interpretation is wrong. Let me see another way. Suppose that \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The \"rest of the days\" could mean the total for all the other days. So Sunday's quantity is twice the total of the rest. Let me try that.\n\nLet the total number bought on the other days (Monday to Saturday) be Y. Then Sunday's is 2Y. Then total papers would be Y + 2Y = 3Y. But the cost would be (2Y *4) + (Y *1). Wait, no. Wait, the cost for the other days: each of the 6 days, but if Y is the total for all non-Sundays, then the cost would be Y * $1, since each paper there costs $1. Sunday's cost is 2Y * $4. So total cost: 2Y*4 + Y*1 = 8Y + Y =9Y. Then 9Y =210 \u2192 Y=210/9 \u224823.333. Which is not an integer. But the answer options are all whole numbers. So that can't be right. So that suggests that my first interpretation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"the rest of the days of the week\" refers to each of the other days. So the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as it does on any other day. So each non-Sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. Then, the total papers would be 6x +2x =8x. The cost would be (2x)*4 +6x*1 \u2192 8x +6x=14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday's papers are x=15, which is option A. But let me check the options again. The options include A as 15, so that's possible. But why is there an option B)30? Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\" is referring to the daily amount. Wait, the wording could be that on Sunday, the number is twice the average of the other days. Hmm, but the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\". Hmm, maybe the problem is that the rest of the days (the other six days) each have the same number, and Sunday's is twice that number. So the same as first approach.\n\nWait, but if the answer is 15, then why would the options include higher numbers? Let me see. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nIf x is the number bought on each non-Sunday day. Then Sunday is 2x.\n\nCost for Sunday: 2x *4 =8x\n\nCost for the other days: 6 days * (x *1) =6x\n\nTotal cost: 8x+6x=14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday is x=15, so answer A. But the options have B as 30, which is double of 15. Maybe I misread the problem?\n\nWait, let me read again the problem's first sentence: \"A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.\" So that's correct. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week. Wait, perhaps the \"rest of the days\" refers to each day, but the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014plural. So perhaps the total for all the other days. So Sunday's count is twice the total of the other days. Let me try that again.\n\nLet me define variables again. Let me suppose that the total number of papers bought on the other days (Monday to Saturday) is Y. So each of the 6 days would have Y/6 papers, but maybe that complicates. Alternatively, let me set Y as the total for the six days. Then Sunday's is 2Y. Then total cost:\n\nSunday's cost: 2Y *4 =8Y\n\nOther days' cost: Y *1 (since each paper there is $1, total papers Y, so cost Y*1). \n\nTotal cost: 8Y + Y =9Y =210 \u2192 Y=210/9 \u224823.333. Not an integer. Since the answer must be an integer, this is impossible. Therefore this interpretation is invalid. So the first interpretation must be correct.\n\nSo the first approach gives x=15, so Monday is 15. Option A. But wait, the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014so if \"the rest of the days\" is plural, then perhaps the average per day of the other days? Like, if the other days each have x, so the average is x. Then Sunday is twice that. Which is the first case. So the answer would be 15. But I'm confused because maybe the question is asking for the total on Sunday? But no, the question is Monday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\"\u2014meaning that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. So each non-Sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. That's the same as before. So the answer would be 15, A. But the options include B)30, which is double. Maybe I made a mistake in the cost calculation?\n\nWait let's check again. Let me re-calculate the total cost with x=15. So Sunday's papers: 2x =30. Each Sunday paper is $4, so 30 *4 =120. The other days: 6 days, each day x=15 papers. So 15*6=90 papers. Each at $1, so $90. Total is 120+90=210. Perfect, that matches the total given. So that's correct. So Monday's papers are 15, so answer A. But why is there an option B?\n\nWait maybe I misread the question. Let me check the question again. The question is \"how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\" So if on Monday they buy x=15, that's A. But maybe the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days combined\"? If that's the case, then the total for the rest of the days (all 6 days) is Y, so Sunday is 2Y. Then total cost would be (2Y)*4 + Y*1 =9Y=210 \u2192 Y=23.333, which isn't possible. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So each non-Sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. So that's the first scenario. Then the answer is A. So why would the options have B as 30? Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014 meaning that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. But perhaps the problem is that the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. Wait, that's the same as before. So the answer is A. But maybe the question is worded differently. Let me read again.\n\nOriginal question: \"A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\"\n\nWait, maybe the key is \"the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014so the rest of the days (other than Sunday) each day's order is x, and Sunday's order is twice the sum of all the other days? Wait, that would be a different interpretation.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The wording here is ambiguous. Let's parse it as:\n\nThe quantity on Sunday = 2 \u00d7 (the quantity on the rest of the days). Since \"the rest of the days\" is plural, perhaps the total for all those days. So Sunday's number is twice the total of the other six days. So let me try this again.\n\nLet Y be the total number of papers bought on the other days (Monday to Saturday). Then Sunday's is 2Y. Total papers: Y +2Y =3Y.\n\nCost for Sunday: 2Y \u00d74 =8Y.\n\nCost for other days: Y \u00d71 (since each paper there is $1, total Y papers cost Y).\n\nTotal cost:8Y +Y=9Y=210 \u2192 Y=210/9 \u224823.333. Not possible. So this is invalid. So that can't be the correct interpretation.\n\nHence the only way to get an integer is the first scenario, where Sunday is twice the daily amount of the other days. So then the answer must be 15, option A. But the options given include A as 15. So that's correct. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the problem's phrasing. Let me see the problem again.\n\nWait the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The \"rest of the days of the week\" could be interpreted as the other days individually. Like, on each of the other days, the number is x, so Sunday is twice that. That would be the first scenario, leading to 15. But maybe the problem's wording is that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. So that would be same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So for example, if they buy 15 on Monday, then Sunday is 30. But that's exactly what the first scenario says. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, but why is option B 30? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck the calculation again.\n\nIf the answer is 15 (A), then the total cost would be:\n\nSunday: 30 papers (2x=30) at $4: 30\u00d74=120.\n\nOther days: 6 days \u00d715 papers each =90 papers at $1: 90\u00d71=90. Total 120+90=210. Perfect.\n\nSo that's correct. So the answer must be A. But the options include A as 15, which is correct. Then why is there an option B? Maybe I made a mistake in the question. Wait the question asks for Monday's count. Which is x=15. So A is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014 meaning the total for the rest of the days. So Sunday is twice that total. So let me see. Let me suppose that the total number on the other days (Monday to Saturday) is Y. So Sunday's number is 2Y. Then total cost would be (2Y)*4 + Y*1 = 9Y. 9Y=210 \u2192 Y=23.333. Not possible. So that's impossible, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the hotel buys twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So each non-Sunday day has x papers, Sunday has 2x. So that's the first scenario, leading to Monday being 15. So the answer is A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A)15. But maybe I made a mistake? Let me see the options again. The options are A to E, with B being 30. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". Wait, perhaps the \"rest of the days of the week\" refers to each day's order. Like, for each day other than Sunday, the number is x, and Sunday's is twice as much as each of those days. So that's the same as before. So the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on all the other days combined. That would be a different scenario. Let me see that possibility.\n\nLet me assume that the number on Sunday is twice the total of all other days. Let Y be the total of the other days (6 days). Then Sunday is 2Y. Total cost: Sunday cost is 2Y*4, other cost Y*1. Total cost: 8Y + Y =9Y=210 \u2192 Y=23.333. Not an integer, so invalid.\n\nThus the only valid scenario is the first, leading to answer A. So why is there an option B? Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's question. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the total on Sunday? But no, the question is about Monday. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the cost. Let me check again. If x is 15, then Sunday's papers: 2x=30. 30\u00d74=120. The other days: 6\u00d715=90. 90\u00d71=90. 120+90=210. Exactly matches. So that's correct. So the answer is A)15. So I think that's correct. Maybe the options are correct, and the answer is A. So the answer is A.\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how many newspapers the hotel buys on Monday. The problem says the newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as the other days. Wait, wait, the wording here is a bit tricky. Let me read that again.\n\n\"A hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Hmm, so does that mean that on each of the other days, they buy a certain number, and on Sunday they buy twice that number? Or is it that the total for Sunday is twice the total of all the other days combined? Wait, probably the first interpretation. Let me parse the sentence again.\n\nThe phrasing is \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Wait, maybe \"the rest of the days\" refers to the average per day? Or maybe the total for the other days? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as: Let the number of papers bought on a non-Sunday day be x. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice that amount, so 2x. But how many days are we talking about here?\n\nWait, the rest of the days of the week. The week has 7 days. So Sunday is one day, and the other six days are Monday to Saturday. So if on each of those six days they buy x papers each, then the total for the other days would be 6x. But the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" Wait, that could be ambiguous. Let me parse it again.\n\nThe problem states: \"the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" So \"the rest of the days\" would be the other six days. So the number bought on Sunday is twice the number bought on each of the other days? Or twice the total for all other days?\n\nHmm, the wording is ambiguous. Let me think. The phrasing is \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.\" The structure is \"twice as many [on Sunday] as [on the rest of the days].\" So the comparison is between the Sunday's quantity and the rest of the days. Wait, but \"the rest of the days\" is plural. So perhaps the total for the other days?\n\nWait, maybe the way to interpret this is: Let the number of papers bought on each of the other days (Monday to Saturday) be x per day. Then, on Sunday, they buy twice as many as they do on each of those days. So Sunday's number would be 2x. Alternatively, maybe the total for all non-Sundays is x, so Sunday's is 2x. The problem is a bit unclear. Let me see how to resolve this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that the number of papers bought on Sunday is twice the number bought on any of the other days. So each non-Sunday day has x papers, Sunday has 2x. That would make sense. Let me try that approach first.\n\nAssuming that each non-Sunday day (so Monday to Saturday, 6 days) has x papers each day, then Sunday has 2x. Then total papers per week would be 6x (for the 6 days) plus 2x (Sunday) = 8x papers. But the cost is given as $210. Let's see the cost calculation.\n\nThe cost on Sunday is $4 per paper, so Sunday's cost is 2x * $4. The other days are $1 per paper, so each of those days is x * $1, so 6x * $1. So total cost is (2x *4) + (6x *1) = 8x +6x= 14x. Wait, that's 14x total dollars. And that's equal to $210. So 14x =210 \u2192 x=15. So then, on Monday, which is a non-Sunday day, they buy x papers, which would be 15. Then the answer would be A)15. But the options have 15 as A and 30 as B. Hmm. But wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe my interpretation is wrong. Let me see another way. Suppose that \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The \"rest of the days\" could mean the total for all the other days. So Sunday's quantity is twice the total of the rest. Let me try that.\n\nLet the total number bought on the other days (Monday to Saturday) be Y. Then Sunday's is 2Y. Then total papers would be Y + 2Y = 3Y. But the cost would be (2Y *4) + (Y *1). Wait, no. Wait, the cost for the other days: each of the 6 days, but if Y is the total for all non-Sundays, then the cost would be Y * $1, since each paper there costs $1. Sunday's cost is 2Y * $4. So total cost: 2Y*4 + Y*1 = 8Y + Y =9Y. Then 9Y =210 \u2192 Y=210/9 \u224823.333. Which is not an integer. But the answer options are all whole numbers. So that can't be right. So that suggests that my first interpretation was correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"the rest of the days of the week\" refers to each of the other days. So the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as it does on any other day. So each non-Sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. Then, the total papers would be 6x +2x =8x. The cost would be (2x)*4 +6x*1 \u2192 8x +6x=14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday's papers are x=15, which is option A. But let me check the options again. The options include A as 15, so that's possible. But why is there an option B)30? Maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\" is referring to the daily amount. Wait, the wording could be that on Sunday, the number is twice the average of the other days. Hmm, but the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\". Hmm, maybe the problem is that the rest of the days (the other six days) each have the same number, and Sunday's is twice that number. So the same as first approach.\n\nWait, but if the answer is 15, then why would the options include higher numbers? Let me see. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nIf x is the number bought on each non-Sunday day. Then Sunday is 2x.\n\nCost for Sunday: 2x *4 =8x\n\nCost for the other days: 6 days * (x *1) =6x\n\nTotal cost: 8x+6x=14x=210 \u2192 x=15. So Monday is x=15, so answer A. But the options have B as 30, which is double of 15. Maybe I misread the problem?\n\nWait, let me read again the problem's first sentence: \"A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.\" So that's correct. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week. Wait, perhaps the \"rest of the days\" refers to each day, but the problem says \"the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014plural. So perhaps the total for all the other days. So Sunday's count is twice the total of the other days. Let me try that again.\n\nLet me define variables again. Let me suppose that the total number of papers bought on the other days (Monday to Saturday) is Y. So each of the 6 days would have Y/6 papers, but maybe that complicates. Alternatively, let me set Y as the total for the six days. Then Sunday's is 2Y. Then total cost:\n\nSunday's cost: 2Y *4 =8Y\n\nOther days' cost: Y *1 (since each paper there is $1, total papers Y, so cost Y*1). \n\nTotal cost: 8Y + Y =9Y =210 \u2192 Y=210/9 \u224823.333. Not an integer. Since the answer must be an integer, this is impossible. Therefore this interpretation is invalid. So the first interpretation must be correct.\n\nSo the first approach gives x=15, so Monday is 15. Option A. But wait, the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014so if \"the rest of the days\" is plural, then perhaps the average per day of the other days? Like, if the other days each have x, so the average is x. Then Sunday is twice that. Which is the first case. So the answer would be 15. But I'm confused because maybe the question is asking for the total on Sunday? But no, the question is Monday.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days\"\u2014meaning that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. So each non-Sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. That's the same as before. So the answer would be 15, A. But the options include B)30, which is double. Maybe I made a mistake in the cost calculation?\n\nWait let's check again. Let me re-calculate the total cost with x=15. So Sunday's papers: 2x =30. Each Sunday paper is $4, so 30 *4 =120. The other days: 6 days, each day x=15 papers. So 15*6=90 papers. Each at $1, so $90. Total is 120+90=210. Perfect, that matches the total given. So that's correct. So Monday's papers are 15, so answer A. But why is there an option B?\n\nWait maybe I misread the question. Let me check the question again. The question is \"how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\" So if on Monday they buy x=15, that's A. But maybe the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does the rest of the days combined\"? If that's the case, then the total for the rest of the days (all 6 days) is Y, so Sunday is 2Y. Then total cost would be (2Y)*4 + Y*1 =9Y=210 \u2192 Y=23.333, which isn't possible. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem says the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So each non-Sunday day is x, Sunday is 2x. So that's the first scenario. Then the answer is A. So why would the options have B as 30? Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014 meaning that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. But perhaps the problem is that the hotel buys twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. Wait, that's the same as before. So the answer is A. But maybe the question is worded differently. Let me read again.\n\nOriginal question: \"A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?\"\n\nWait, maybe the key is \"the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014so the rest of the days (other than Sunday) each day's order is x, and Sunday's order is twice the sum of all the other days? Wait, that would be a different interpretation.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The wording here is ambiguous. Let's parse it as:\n\nThe quantity on Sunday = 2 \u00d7 (the quantity on the rest of the days). Since \"the rest of the days\" is plural, perhaps the total for all those days. So Sunday's number is twice the total of the other six days. So let me try this again.\n\nLet Y be the total number of papers bought on the other days (Monday to Saturday). Then Sunday's is 2Y. Total papers: Y +2Y =3Y.\n\nCost for Sunday: 2Y \u00d74 =8Y.\n\nCost for other days: Y \u00d71 (since each paper there is $1, total Y papers cost Y).\n\nTotal cost:8Y +Y=9Y=210 \u2192 Y=210/9 \u224823.333. Not possible. So this is invalid. So that can't be the correct interpretation.\n\nHence the only way to get an integer is the first scenario, where Sunday is twice the daily amount of the other days. So then the answer must be 15, option A. But the options given include A as 15. So that's correct. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the problem's phrasing. Let me see the problem again.\n\nWait the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". The \"rest of the days of the week\" could be interpreted as the other days individually. Like, on each of the other days, the number is x, so Sunday is twice that. That would be the first scenario, leading to 15. But maybe the problem's wording is that the number on Sunday is twice the number on each of the other days. So that would be same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So for example, if they buy 15 on Monday, then Sunday is 30. But that's exactly what the first scenario says. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, but why is option B 30? Maybe I'm missing something. Let me recheck the calculation again.\n\nIf the answer is 15 (A), then the total cost would be:\n\nSunday: 30 papers (2x=30) at $4: 30\u00d74=120.\n\nOther days: 6 days \u00d715 papers each =90 papers at $1: 90\u00d71=90. Total 120+90=210. Perfect.\n\nSo that's correct. So the answer must be A. But the options include A as 15, which is correct. Then why is there an option B? Maybe I made a mistake in the question. Wait the question asks for Monday's count. Which is x=15. So A is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem says \"twice as many on Sunday as it does on the rest of the days of the week\"\u2014 meaning the total for the rest of the days. So Sunday is twice that total. So let me see. Let me suppose that the total number on the other days (Monday to Saturday) is Y. So Sunday's number is 2Y. Then total cost would be (2Y)*4 + Y*1 = 9Y. 9Y=210 \u2192 Y=23.333. Not possible. So that's impossible, so that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the hotel buys twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. So each non-Sunday day has x papers, Sunday has 2x. So that's the first scenario, leading to Monday being 15. So the answer is A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A)15. But maybe I made a mistake? Let me see the options again. The options are A to E, with B being 30. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week\". Wait, perhaps the \"rest of the days of the week\" refers to each day's order. Like, for each day other than Sunday, the number is x, and Sunday's is twice as much as each of those days. So that's the same as before. So the answer is A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the hotel orders twice as many on Sunday as it does on all the other days combined. That would be a different scenario. Let me see that possibility.\n\nLet me assume that the number on Sunday is twice the total of all other days. Let Y be the total of the other days (6 days). Then Sunday is 2Y. Total cost: Sunday cost is 2Y*4, other cost Y*1. Total cost: 8Y + Y =9Y=210 \u2192 Y=23.333. Not an integer, so invalid.\n\nThus the only valid scenario is the first, leading to answer A. So why is there an option B? Maybe I made a mistake in the problem's question. Wait, maybe the question is asking for the total on Sunday? But no, the question is about Monday. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the cost. Let me check again. If x is 15, then Sunday's papers: 2x=30. 30\u00d74=120. The other days: 6\u00d715=90. 90\u00d71=90. 120+90=210. Exactly matches. So that's correct. So the answer is A)15. So I think that's correct. Maybe the options are correct, and the answer is A. So the answer is A.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote the number of newspapers bought on each non-Sunday day (Monday to Saturday) as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on each of the other days. Therefore, the number of newspapers bought on Sunday is \\( 2x \\).\n\n**Calculating the total cost:**\n- **Sunday's cost:** \\( 2x \\) newspapers at \\$4 each: \\( 2x \\times 4 = 8x \\).\n- **Other days' cost:** \\( 6 \\) days (Monday to Saturday) with \\( x \\) newspapers each at \\$1: \\( 6x \\times 1 = 6x \\).\n\nThe total weekly cost is given as \\$210, so:\n\\[\n8x + 6x = 14x = 210\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = \\frac{210}{14} = 15\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of newspapers bought on Monday (a non-Sunday day) is \\( x = 15 \\).\n\n**Verification:**\n- Sunday's newspapers: \\( 2x = 30 \\).\n- Cost for Sunday: \\( 30 \\times 4 = 120 \\).\n- Cost for other days: \\( 6 \\times 15 = 90 \\).\n- Total cost: \\( 120 + 90 = 210 \\), which matches the given total.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **A)15**.\n\nAnswer: A",
