      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Peter wants to form a scavenger hunt team with 10 additional people, making the total team size 11 including himself. He has 10 friends who want to participate. Hmm, wait a second. If he needs 10 more people besides himself, but he only has 10 friends, then that means he has to choose all of them? Because 10 friends are exactly the number he needs. So there's no choice involved here; he can't leave anyone out. So the number of ways to choose all 10 friends from 10 is just 1. Like, combination formula: 10 choose 10 is 1. So the answer should be B)1. Let me think again. The problem says \"10 additional people\", so Peter plus 10 friends makes 11, but his friends are exactly 10. So he must pick all of them. There's only one way to do that. Yeah, so the answer is B.\n",

Wait a second, if there are exactly 10 friends and he needs 10 more people, then he has to include all of them, right? Because if he has exactly 10 friends available and he needs 10 more, there's no choice here. He can't leave anyone out because that would mean the team would have fewer than 10 additional people. So the only possible way is to take all 10 friends. Therefore, the number of choices is 1. Let me think again. The problem is about choosing 10 people out of 10. The combination formula would be C(10,10) which is 1. So the answer should be B)1. But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Like, does the question consider Peter as part of the count? Let me re-read the question. It says \"form a scavenger hunt team with him\", so Peter is already on the team, and he needs 10 more from his friends.
