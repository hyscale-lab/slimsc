      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Julie has a rectangular yard. One side is 100 feet wide, and the total area is 3,000 square feet. The question is asking for the length of the other side. Hmm, right. Let me think.\n\nAlright, rectangles have area calculated by length multiplied by width. The formula is area = length \u00d7 width. So here, they've given one side as 100 feet. Wait, but which one is that? Like, is that the length or the width? Well, in rectangles, the terms length and width are kind of interchangeable depending on orientation, but usually, they might refer to the sides as length and width. The problem says \"one side is 100 feet wide.\" Oh, the word \"wide\" here probably refers to the width. So the width is 100 feet. Then the other side would be the length.\n\nSo the area is 3000 square feet. So using the formula, 3000 = length \u00d7 100. To find the length, divide both sides by 100. Let me calculate that: 3000 divided by 100 is 30. Wait, that would make the length 30 feet. So the answer would be option A, 30 feet?\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I mixed up length and width. Suppose the 100 feet is the length, then the width would be the other side. So area is length \u00d7 width, so 3000 = 100 \u00d7 width. Then width would be 3000/100 = 30. Either way, the other side is 30. So yes, answer A makes sense. Let me check the options again. Option A is 30. The options are A to E, with E being 60. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate. 100 multiplied by 30 is indeed 3000. So that's correct. Then why am I second-guessing?\n\nAlternatively, could there be a trick in the question? Like maybe the \"other side\" refers to something else? But no, a rectangle has two dimensions, so the other side's length would be the other dimension. The problem is straightforward. So the answer must be A)30 feet. Wait, but let me check the options again. The options given are A)30, B)20, C)10, D)50, E)60. So 30 is there as option A. So that's the correct choice. I think that's it.\n",
