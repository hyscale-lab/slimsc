      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the weight of the new truck that was added to the group of vehicles. The problem says the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then, when the new truck is added, the average increases by 2.6 tons. Hmm, right, so the new average is the original average plus 2.6.\n\nFirst, maybe I should calculate the total weight of the original 10 vehicles. Since the average is 12.2 tons, the total would be 10 multiplied by 12.2. Let me do that: 10 * 12.2 equals 122 tons. That's the total before the truck is added.\n\nNow, when the truck is added, there are now 11 vehicles in total. The new average is the original average plus 2.6, so that's 12.2 + 2.6. Let me add those: 12.2 plus 2.6 is 14.8 tons. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the problem says the average increased by 2.6 tons. So the new average is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons? Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo the new total weight after adding the truck would be the new average times the number of vehicles now, which is 11. So 14.8 multiplied by 11. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 14.8 * 10 is 148, plus another 14.8 gives 162.8. So the total weight after adding the truck is 162.8 tons.\n\nThe original total was 122 tons. So the truck's weight must be the difference between the new total and the original total. So 162.8 minus 122. Let me subtract that: 162.8 - 122 equals 40.8? Wait, but that would be option A. But let me double-check my math here because sometimes I might have messed up a step.\n\nWait a second, 14.8 times 11: let me do that again. 14.8 * 11. Break it down: 14.8 *10 is 148, plus 14.8 is 148 +14.8=162.8. Yes, that's correct. Original total is 122. 162.8 -122 is indeed 40.8. So that would be option A. But wait, the options given are A)40.8, B)41.6, etc. So the answer would be A?\n\nWait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the average calculation. Let me check the problem again. The average increased by 2.6 tons after adding the truck. So original average 12.2, new average is 12.2 +2.6 =14.8. So that's correct. Then the total after adding is 14.8 *11 =162.8. Subtract original total 122 gives 40.8. So the answer should be A. But the options include higher numbers. Wait, maybe I messed up the new average?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should approach it another way. Let me think of another method to confirm. The total increase per vehicle when adding the new truck. The new truck's weight contributes to the average. \n\nThe original total is 122. Let the truck's weight be x. The new average is (122 +x)/11 = 12.2 +2.6 =14.8. So solving for x:\n\n(122 +x)/11 =14.8\n\nMultiply both sides by 11: 122 +x =14.8*11 =162.8\n\nThen x=162.8-122 =40.8. Yep, so that's the same answer. So the correct answer is A. But wait the options are given as A to E, and A is 40.8, which matches. So why am I confused? Maybe the options are correct. Let me check again the problem statement.\n\nWait, the question says \"the average of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added.\" So yes, that's exactly the way I solved it. Then the answer must be A. But I recall sometimes when averages increase, the calculation might be different. Wait, let me see another perspective.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the increase in average is 2.6, so the total increase for all 11 vehicles? Let me see. The original average was 12.2. The new average is 12.2 +2.6 =14.8. The total increase is (14.8 -12.2) multiplied by the original number of vehicles plus one? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the total increase in the total weight would be the new average times new count minus original total. \n\nAlternatively, the truck's weight has to account for the original total plus the truck equals new total, which is (original average +2.6)*(original count +1). Which is exactly what I did before. So that's correct. So the answer should be A)40.8. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in these problems, people might make an error in the number of vehicles. Let me check the numbers again.\n\nOriginal count: 10, so after adding one, 11. The total of 10 is 122. The new average is 14.8, so 14.8*11=162.8. 162.8-122 is 40.8. Yes, so the answer is A. Maybe the options are correct. Let me check the options again. The options given are A through E, with A being 40.8, so that's the correct one. So the answer must be A.\n",

Then when they add a new truck, the average increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of that truck.\n\nAlright, first, I remember that average is total divided by the number of items. So the original total weight of the 10 vehicles would be 10 times 12.2. Let me calculate that. 10 times 12 is 120, plus 10 times 0.2 is 2, so total is 122 tons. Right, that's the original total.\n\nNow, when they add the new truck, the number of vehicles becomes 11. The new average is the original average plus 2.6 tons. So the new average is 12.2 + 2.6.
