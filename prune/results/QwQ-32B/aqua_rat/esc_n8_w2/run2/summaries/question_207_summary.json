      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this algebra problem. Let me read it again carefully. The question says: If 10 is subtracted from two-thirds of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and one-third of the number. I have to find the number. The options are given as A to E.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let me denote the unknown number as x. Then, the problem can be translated into an equation step by step. \n\nFirst part: \"If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number...\" So that would be (2/3)x minus 10. Wait, no, actually, the wording is \"10 subtracted from 2/3 of the number\" which would be (2/3)x - 10. \n\nThe result of that is equal to \"the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.\" The sum of 40 and (1/3)x would be 40 + (1/3)x. \n\nSo putting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nNow I need to solve for x. Let me rearrange the equation. Maybe subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get the x terms on one side. \n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x -10 = 40\n\nThat simplifies to (1/3)x -10 = 40. Wait, let me check that again. Yes, 2/3 minus 1/3 is 1/3. \n\nThen, add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with x:\n\n(1/3)x = 40 +10 \u2192 (1/3)x = 50\n\nThen, multiply both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\nx = 50 *3 = 150\n\nHmm, so x is 150. Let me check the options. Option C is 150, so that would be the answer. Wait, but let me verify my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.\n\nLet me plug x=150 back into the original equation to see if both sides are equal.\n\nLeft side: (2/3)*150 -10. Let's compute that. 2/3 of 150 is (2*150)/3 = 300/3 = 100. Then subtract 10 gives 90.\n\nRight side: 40 + (1/3)*150. 1/3 of 150 is 50, so 40+50 = 90. \n\nYes, both sides equal 90. So that checks out. So the correct answer must be C)150. \n\nWait a second, but let me look at the options again. The options are A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220. So yes, C is 150, which matches my calculation. \n\nHmm, but just to be thorough, maybe I should try another option to ensure there's no mistake. Let's try option B, 160, just in case. \n\nLeft side: (2/3)*160 -10. 2/3 of 160 is (320/3) \u2248 106.666..., subtract 10 gives about 96.666. \n\nRight side: 40 + (1/3)*160. 1/3 of 160 is ~53.333, so total is 93.333. These are not equal, so B is wrong. \n\nHow about option D, 210? Let's see. Left side: (2/3)*210 = 140, minus 10 is 130. Right side: 40 + (1/3)*210 = 40 +70 =110. Not equal. \n\nOption A, 100: left side (2/3)*100 = 200/3 \u224866.666 -10 \u224856.666. Right side 40 + (1/3)*100 \u224840+33.333=73.333. Not equal. \n\nE)220: left side 2/3 *220 \u2248146.666-10=136.666. Right side 40 + (220/3)\u224840+73.333=113.333. Not equal. \n\nSo only C gives equal results on both sides. So I'm confident that C is correct.\n",
