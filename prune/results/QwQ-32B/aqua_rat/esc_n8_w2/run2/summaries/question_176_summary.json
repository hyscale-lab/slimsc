      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the interest Jerry's bond accrued at maturity. Let's see. The bond is a 1-year $5000 one with 12% annual interest, but it's compounded every six months. Hmm, right, compounding means the interest is calculated and added twice a year here. \n\nWait, the question is asking for the total interest at maturity. So first, I should recall the compound interest formula. The formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after time t, P the principal, r the annual rate, n the number of times compounded per year, and t the time in years. \n\nHere, P is $5000. The annual rate is 12%, so r is 0.12. Since it's compounded every six months, that's twice a year, so n=2. The time is 1 year, so t=1. \n\nPlugging into the formula: A = 5000*(1 + 0.12/2)^(2*1). Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, 0.12 divided by 2 is 0.06. So each compounding period has a 6% rate. Then, 1 + 0.06 is 1.06. The exponent is 2*1 = 2. So 1.06 squared. \n\nCalculating 1.06 squared: 1.06 * 1.06. Let's do that. 1*1 is 1, 1*0.06 is 0.06, 0.06*1 is another 0.06, and 0.06*0.06 is 0.0036. Adding all those: 1 + 0.06+0.06 +0.0036 = 1.1236. So 1.06 squared is 1.1236. \n\nSo the total amount A is 5000 multiplied by 1.1236. Let me compute that. 5000*1.1236. Well, 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 *0.12 is 600, and 5000 *0.0036 is 18. Wait, maybe better to break it down:\n\n5000 * 1.1236 = 5000 * (1 + 0.12 + 0.0036) but maybe that's complicating. Alternatively, 5000 *1.1236. Let me just multiply step by step. \n\nAlternatively, 5000 * 1.1236: 5000 *1 =5000, 5000 *0.12 is 600, and 5000*0.0036 is 18. So adding those together: 5000 +600 is 5600, plus 18 gives 5618. Wait, but that might not be the right way to split. Because 1.1236 is actually 1 + 0.12 +0.0036? Wait no. Wait 1.1236 is 1.06 squared, which is 1.1236, so the correct way is just 5000 multiplied by that.\n\nAlternatively, 5000 *1.1236. Let me compute 5000 * 1.1236:\n\nFirst, 5000 *1 =5000.\n\n5000 *0.12 = 600, but that's the annual rate. Wait, maybe better to compute 1.1236 *5000:\n\nLet me think of 1.1236 *5000.\n\n5000 *1.1236 = 5000 * (1.1 +0.0236) = 5000*1.1 is 5500, plus 5000*0.0236.\n\n5000 *0.02 is 100, and 5000*0.0036 is 18. So 100+18 is 118. So total 5500 +118 =5618.\n\nSo the total amount after a year is $5618. \n\nTherefore, the interest is the amount minus principal: 5618 -5000 = 618. \n\nLooking at the options, B is $618. So the answer must be B. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation steps. Let me recalculate the 1.06 squared again. 1.06 *1.06. 1 times 1 is 1, 1*0.06 is 0.06, 0.06*1 is 0.06, and 0.06*0.06 is 0.0036. Adding all together gives 1 +0.06+0.06 +0.0036 =1.1236. So that's correct. Then 5000 *1.1236 is indeed 5618. \n\nSubtracting the principal gives 618. So yes, option B is the correct answer. The other options don't make sense. For example, option E is 200, which would be simple interest (5000 *0.12 =600, but maybe half a year? Wait no, simple interest for a year would be 600. So that's not it. But the question says compounded every six months, so the interest is higher than simple. So 618 makes sense. So the answer is B.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so Jerry bought a $5,000 bond with a 12% annual interest rate, compounded every six months. The question is asking how much interest had accrued at maturity, which is after one year. Hmm, I need to calculate the compound interest here.\n\nFirst, I remember that compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:\n- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.\n- P is the principal amount ($5,000 here).\n- r is the annual interest rate (12%, so 0.12 as a decimal).\n- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.\n- t is the time the money is invested for in years (1 year here).\n\nSince it's compounded every six months, that means n is 2. So plugging into the formula, let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the rate per period. The annual rate is 12%, so each compounding period (every six months) the rate would be 12% divided by 2, which is 6% per period. So 0.12/2 = 0.06.\n\nThe number of periods in one year would be 2 (since twice a year). So total periods nt is 2*1 = 2.\n\nSo the formula becomes A = 5000*(1 + 0.06)^2.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1 + 0.06 is 1.06. Squaring that gives 1.06 *1.06. Let me compute that. 1.06 times 1.06: 1.06*1 is 1.06, 1.06*0.06 is 0.0636. Adding them gives 1.1236. \n\nSo A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let me multiply that out. 5000 *1.1236. \n\nWell, 5000 *1 is 5000, and 5000 *0.1236 is 5000 *0.12 is 600, plus 5000*0.0036 is 18. So total 600+18=618. So adding to the principal, that's 5000 + 618 = 5618. So the total amount after a year is $5,618.\n\nThe question asks for the interest accrued, so subtract the principal. 5618 -5000 = 618. So the interest is $618, which is option B. Let me check the options again. Option B is 618. \n\nWait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculation steps. Let me re-calculate the 1.06 squared again. 1.06 *1.06: 1*1 is 1, 1*0.06 is 0.06, 0.06*1 is 0.06, and 0.06*0.06 is 0.0036. Adding all those terms: 1 +0.06+0.06 +0.0036 = 1.1236. That's correct. So 5000*1.1236 is indeed 5000*(1 + 0.1236) = 5000 + 5000*0.1236. The 5000*0.1236 is exactly the interest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the formula again. The problem says \"accrued at maturity\", which is after 1 year. Since it's compounded semi-annually, the two periods each get 6% interest. \n\nAlternatively, another way to compute it step by step. After the first six months, the interest is 5000 *0.06 = 300, so the amount is 5300. Then the next six months, the interest is 5300 *0.06. Let me compute that. 5300 *0.06 is 318. So total after second period: 5300 + 318 = 5618. So total interest is 618. Yep, same result. \n\nSo the answer should be B) $618.\n",

So plugging into the formula, let me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, let's compute the rate per period. The annual rate is 12%, so each compounding period (every six months) the rate would be 12% divided by 2, which is 6% per period. So 0.12/2 = 0.06.\n\nThe number of periods in one year would be 2 (since twice a year). So total periods nt is 2*1 = 2.\n\nSo the formula becomes A = 5000*(1 + 0.06)^2.\n\nLet me calculate that. 1 + 0.06 is 1.06. Squaring that gives 1.06 *1.06. Let me compute that. 1.06 times 1.06: 1.06*1 is 1.06, 1.06*0.06 is 0.0636. Adding them gives 1.1236. \n\nSo A = 5000 * 1.1236. Let me multiply that out. 5000 *1.1236. \n\nWell, 5000 *1 is 5000, and 5000 *0.1236 is 5000 *0.12 is 600, plus 5000*0.0036 is 18. So total 600+18=618. So adding to the principal, that's 5000 + 618 = 5618. So the total amount after a year is $5,618.\n\nThe question asks for the interest accrued, so subtract the principal. 5618 -5000 = 618.

So 5000*1.1236 is indeed 5000*(1 + 0.1236) = 5000 + 5000*0.1236. The 5000*0.1236 is exactly the interest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should check the formula again. The problem says \"accrued at maturity\", which is after 1 year. Since it's compounded semi-annually, the two periods each get 6% interest. \n\nAlternatively, another way to compute it step by step.
