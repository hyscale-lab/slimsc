      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out the maximum distance someone can travel with $8.50 in a cab that has a specific fare structure. Let's see. The problem says the cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and then 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile. Hmm. I have to calculate how far that $8.50 can take them.\n\nFirst, I should break down the costs. The initial charge is for the first quarter-mile, which is 0.25 miles. That's $3.50. Then, every additional quarter mile costs $0.10. Wait, so after the first quarter-mile, each quarter mile is 10 cents. So the total cost is the initial fee plus the cost for the additional distance.\n\nLet me structure this. Let me denote the total distance as D. The first 0.25 miles cost $3.50. The remaining distance beyond that is (D - 0.25) miles. Since each quarter mile after that is charged, I need to convert that remaining distance into quarters. Each quarter is 0.25 miles. So the number of additional quarter-miles would be (D - 0.25) divided by 0.25. Let me write that as (D - 0.25)/0.25. That's the number of additional quarters. Each of those quarters costs 10 cents, which is $0.10. \n\nSo the total cost equation would be:\n\nTotal Cost = 3.50 + 0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25]\n\nBut the total cost can't exceed $8.50. So we set this equal to 8.50 and solve for D.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n3.50 + 0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25] = 8.50\n\nFirst, subtract 3.50 from both sides:\n\n0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25] = 8.50 - 3.50 = 5.00\n\nSo, 0.10 * [(D - 0.25)/0.25] = 5.00\n\nDivide both sides by 0.10:\n\n[(D - 0.25)/0.25] = 5.00 / 0.10 = 50\n\nSo, (D - 0.25)/0.25 = 50\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.25:\n\nD - 0.25 = 50 * 0.25\n\n50 * 0.25 is 12.5, right? Because 0.25 * 40 is 10, plus 10*0.25 is 2.5, so total 12.5.\n\nSo D - 0.25 = 12.5\n\nAdding 0.25 to both sides:\n\nD = 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles.\n\nHmm, so that would be option B)12.75 miles.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Let me go through each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with the total cost formula. The first quarter mile is 0.25 miles for $3.50. Then each additional quarter mile is $0.10. So, after the first 0.25 miles, every 0.25 miles adds 10 cents. So if someone travels D miles, the extra distance beyond the first quarter mile is D - 0.25. The number of quarter miles in that extra distance is (D -0.25)/0.25. Since each of those is a quarter mile segment. \n\nSo the total cost is indeed 3.50 plus 0.10 times that number. \n\nLet me plug D =12.75 into the equation to check. \n\nFirst, subtract 0.25: 12.75 -0.25 =12.5 miles. \n\nDivide by 0.25: 12.5 /0.25 = 50. \n\nSo 50 additional quarter miles. Each is $0.10, so 50*0.10 = $5. \n\nAdding the initial $3.50: 3.50 +5=8.50. Exactly the amount given. \n\nSo that's correct. \n\nHmm, but wait, the options include 12.75 which is B. So that's the answer. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that I didn't mix up miles and quarters somewhere. Let me see again. \n\nThe first 0.25 miles is the initial charge. Then each additional quarter mile (so every 0.25 after that). So the total distance is 0.25 + (number of additional quarters)*0.25. \n\nYes, so the equation is correct. So the answer must be B.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the maximum distance achievable with $8.50, start by accounting for the initial charge. The first quarter-mile costs $3.50, leaving $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 for additional distance. Each subsequent quarter-mile costs $0.10, so the number of additional quarter-miles is $5.00 / $0.10 = 50. Each of these represents 0.25 miles, so 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles. Adding the initial 0.25 miles gives a total distance of 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles. \n\nAnswer: B)12.75 miles.\n\nAnswer: B",

The total money is $8.50. Subtract the $3.50 initial charge. Let me do that calculation: 8.50 minus 3.50 equals 5.00.
