      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so there's this problem about three painters\u2014Mr. Brown, Mr. Black, and Mr. Blue\u2014each with different painting speeds. The company has to paint three houses. The question is asking how many days Mr. Blue will need to finish the contract after some other events happen. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out each painter's work rate. Since Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, his rate is 1/6 of a house per day. Similarly, Mr. Black's rate is 1/8 per day, and Mr. Blue's is 1/12 per day. Wait, right, because work rate is usually calculated as 1 divided by the time taken to complete one job. So that's correct.\n\nThe contract is to paint three houses. The problem mentions that after 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, and then Mr. Black works for 6 days. Then we have to find out how long Mr. Blue needs to finish the remaining work. Hmm, but who is working during those initial 8 days? The problem might be implying that all three are working together initially, but the question's wording isn't entirely clear. Wait, let me check the question again.\n\nThe question says: \"A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nWait a second, maybe I misread. Let me parse it again. The sequence is:\n\n- First, there's an initial period of 8 days. Then Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. Then we need to find how long Blue takes to finish. But who is working during those first 8 days?\n\nHmm, the problem might be structured as follows: The company has three painters, and they start working on the houses. The first 8 days, perhaps all three are working together? Or maybe only some of them? The problem isn't entirely clear. Wait, maybe the problem says that initially, only Mr. Brown is working? Or maybe the setup is that they start with some workers, then others join or leave?\n\nWait, the problem says \"After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Wait, that wording is a bit confusing. So after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. But was Mr. Black already working before that? Or is this the first time he starts?\n\nHmm. The problem might be that initially, only Mr. Brown was working for the first 8 days, then he leaves, and Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. Then Mr. Blue has to finish. But that might not make sense because the contract requires three houses, so maybe all three are working together? Or perhaps the problem is structured as a sequence where first Mr. Brown works alone for 8 days, then Mr. Black works alone for 6 days, and then Mr. Blue must do the rest. Wait, but that would be a possible interpretation. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that all three are working together for some initial period, but the first 8 days, then Mr. Brown leaves, so the next 6 days only Mr. Black is working (maybe with someone else?), but the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Hmm, maybe the problem is that after 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, and then Mr. Black starts working (possibly alongside others?), but the question is a bit ambiguous. Wait, perhaps the problem is that the company is using different workers at different times. Let me try to parse the problem again carefully.\n\nThe problem says: \"A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nHmm. The key here is to figure out the timeline of who is working when. The problem states that after 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation. Then, Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. Wait, but does that mean that before those 6 days, Mr. Black wasn't working? Or was he already working?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial 8 days involved all three working together, then Mr. Brown leaves, and then Mr. Black works alone for 6 days. But the problem isn't explicit about that. Alternatively, maybe Mr. Brown was the only one working for the first 8 days, then he leaves, and then Mr. Black starts working for 6 days, after which Mr. Blue has to finish the job. The problem is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps the question expects that interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first 8 days, Mr. Brown is working on one house, and then others start? Hmm, this is getting confusing. Let me think again. Since the problem mentions the contract is to paint three houses, perhaps each painter is assigned to a house? Or maybe they are all working together on the same houses. The problem isn't entirely clear, but in work-rate problems, typically, when multiple workers are involved, their rates add up. So perhaps all three are working together for the initial period, then some leave and others join.\n\nWait, the problem says \"After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" Wait, maybe \"begins to work\" implies that Mr. Black wasn't working before? So perhaps initially, only Mr. Brown was working for the first 8 days, then he leaves, and Mr. Black starts working alone for 6 days, and then Mr. Blue has to finish. That would make sense. Let me test this assumption.\n\nSo first scenario: For the first 8 days, only Mr. Brown is painting. His rate is 1/6 per day. So in 8 days, he paints 8*(1/6) = 8/6 = 4/3 houses. Then, after that, Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. His rate is 1/8 per day. So in 6 days, he paints 6*(1/8)=6/8=3/4 of a house. Then, the total painted so far is 4/3 + 3/4. Let me compute that: 4/3 is about 1.333..., and 3/4 is 0.75, so together that's 2.083... houses. Since the total needed is 3, the remaining would be 3 - 2.083... \u2248 0.916... houses. Then Mr. Blue has to paint that remaining part at 1/12 per day, so time needed is (remaining)/ (1/12) = (11/12)/(1/12) = 11 days? Wait, but 3 - (4/3 + 3/4) is let's compute exactly.\n\nLet me do the fractions properly. 4/3 + 3/4 = (16/12 + 9/12) = 25/12. So total painted is 25/12. The total needed is 3, which is 36/12. So remaining is 36/12 -25/12 =11/12. So 11/12 divided by (1/12 per day) is indeed 11 days. So the answer would be D)11? But wait, let me check if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nBut hold on, maybe the initial 8 days involved all three working together? Let me see. If that were the case, their combined rate would be (1/6 + 1/8 +1/12) per day. Let me compute that. Let's find a common denominator, which would be 24. So 4/24 + 3/24 + 2/24 = 9/24 = 3/8 per day. So in 8 days, they would paint 8*(3/8) = 3 houses. Wait, that's exactly the total needed. So if all three were working together for 8 days, they would finish all three houses, so there would be nothing left. But then the question's scenario of Mr. Black working for 6 days and then Blue finishing doesn't make sense. So that must not be the case. Therefore, the initial interpretation must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so maybe the initial 8 days only involve Mr. Brown and another worker? Or perhaps the problem is structured such that each painter is assigned to a different house. For example, Mr. Brown paints one house, Mr. Black another, and Mr. Blue the third. But the problem says the company contracts to paint 3 houses, so maybe each painter is working on a separate house. But the problem mentions that after 8 days Mr. Brown leaves. So let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three painters are all working on the same houses, but the problem is about how much they can paint collectively over time.\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem again step by step. The company has to paint 3 houses. The time taken by each painter per house is given. The sequence of work is:\n\n1. For the first 8 days, some workers are working. The problem says \"after 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation\", which implies that he was working before that. The problem doesn't mention others, so maybe only Mr. Brown was working for the first 8 days. Then, after those 8 days, he leaves. Then, Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. The problem says \"begins to work for a period of 6 days\"\u2014so perhaps he starts working then and works for 6 days, but who else is working during that time?\n\nWait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me see the possible interpretations again.\n\nInterpretation 1: \n\n- First 8 days: Only Mr. Brown is working. Then he leaves. Then Mr. Black works alone for 6 days. Then Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work alone. That's the first scenario.\n\nInterpretation 2:\n\n- First 8 days: All three are working together. Then Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black continues (maybe with Blue?) but the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\"\u2014if he was already working, then \"begins\" is confusing. So that might not be the case.\n\nInterpretation 3:\n\n- Maybe the first 8 days, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black are working together, then Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black works with Mr. Blue for 6 days? But the problem states that Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days, so perhaps he was not working before?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the first 8 days, only Mr. Brown is working. Then, after that, Mr. Black starts working (so now both Mr. Brown and Black? But Brown left?), no, Brown went on vacation. So after 8 days, Mr. Brown is gone. Then, Mr. Black starts working alone for 6 days. Then, after those 6 days, Mr. Blue must finish the job. \n\nThis seems to make sense. So let's recalculate under that scenario.\n\nFirst 8 days: Mr. Brown paints 8*(1/6) = 8/6 = 4/3 houses. \n\nThen, next 6 days: Mr. Black works alone, so 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 houses.\n\nTotal painted after these periods: 4/3 + 3/4 = (16/12 + 9/12) = 25/12 \u2248 2.0833 houses.\n\nTotal needed is 3, so remaining work is 3 - 25/12 = (36/12 -25/12)=11/12 of a house.\n\nMr. Blue's rate is 1/12 per day. So time needed is (11/12) / (1/12) = 11 days. So the answer would be D)11.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\". If he was not working before, then that's correct. But what about Mr. Blue? Is he working during any of these periods?\n\nAh, here's another possible mistake. Maybe during the first 8 days, both Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue were working, and then after that, Mr. Black starts. Wait, the problem doesn't mention Mr. Blue at all except in the end. Hmm, maybe the problem is that all three are working together until Mr. Brown leaves, then Mr. Black works alone? Wait, the problem's wording is unclear. Let me read the problem again:\n\nOriginal problem:\n\n\"A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nSo the key points:\n\n- The company is painting 3 houses.\n\n- Each painter has their own rate.\n\n- After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation.\n\n- Then, Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days.\n\nThe problem is asking how many days Mr. Blue needs to complete the contract.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the \"contract\" requires painting all three houses, so all the work done so far plus the remaining work must equal three houses. The problem is structured as:\n\nThe work is done in three phases:\n\n1. First phase: 8 days with some workers (probably Mr. Brown and others? Or just Brown?)\n\n2. Second phase: 6 days with Mr. Black (and maybe others?)\n\n3. Third phase: Mr. Blue works alone until completion.\n\nBut the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\" after Brown leaves. So perhaps before that, Mr. Black wasn't working. So the first 8 days, perhaps only Mr. Brown was working, then after he leaves, Mr. Black starts working for 6 days (alone?), then Mr. Blue has to finish. That's the same as the first scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the first phase, Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue were working, then Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts. But the problem doesn't mention Mr. Blue's involvement before that. Hmm, this is a problem with the question's wording. \n\nAlternatively, maybe all three were working together in the first 8 days. Let's try that.\n\nFirst 8 days: All three working together. Their combined rate is (1/6 + 1/8 +1/12). Let me compute that again:\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n1/6 = 4/24, 1/8=3/24, 1/12=2/24. Sum is 9/24 = 3/8 per day. So in 8 days, they do 8*(3/8)=3 houses. That's exactly the total needed, so the contract would be done in 8 days. But then after that, Mr. Brown leaves, and then Mr. Black works for 6 days, but the work is already done. So that can't be. So this scenario is invalid.\n\nHence, the first interpretation must be the correct one: Only Mr. Brown is working for the first 8 days. Then, Mr. Black starts working alone for 6 days. Then, the remaining work is done by Mr. Blue.\n\nWait but why would the problem mention Mr. Blue at all then? Unless Mr. Blue is part of the initial team? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe after Mr. Black's 6 days, Mr. Blue is the only one left to finish. So the problem is that the total work is 3 houses. Let me confirm again the math:\n\nFirst phase (8 days): Mr. Brown paints 8*(1/6) = 4/3 \u22481.333 houses.\n\nSecond phase (6 days): Mr. Black paints 6*(1/8)= 0.75 houses. Total so far: ~2.083 houses. Remaining: ~0.9167, which is 11/12. \n\nMr. Blue paints at 1/12 per day, so 11/12 divided by 1/12 is 11 days. So the answer is D)11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that all three are working together for the first 8 days except when someone leaves. Wait, perhaps the first 8 days, all three are working, then Mr. Brown leaves, and then Mr. Black and Mr. Blue work together for 6 days? Then Mr. Blue has to finish alone?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\". If he was already working, then \"begins\" might not make sense. So perhaps he wasn't working before. So during the first 8 days, only Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue were working? Let me try that.\n\nSuppose first 8 days: Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue are working. Their combined rate is 1/6 +1/12 = (2/12 +1/12)= 3/12=1/4 per day. So in 8 days, they paint 8*(1/4) = 2 houses. Then, after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves. Then Mr. Black starts working (so now, is he working with Mr. Blue?) The problem states that Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. So perhaps during those 6 days, Mr. Black and Mr. Blue work together. Their combined rate would be 1/8 +1/12. Let's compute that: 3/24 + 2/24 =5/24 per day. Over 6 days, that's 6*(5/24)=30/24=5/4=1.25 houses. Total painted so far would be 2+1.25=3.25. But the contract is only 3 houses, so that's over. So that can't be right. Hmm, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the 6 days after Mr. Brown leaves, only Mr. Black is working, and Mr. Blue hasn't started yet. Then, after those 6 days, it's Mr. Blue's turn. Let's recalculate:\n\nFirst phase (8 days): Mr. Brown and Blue working. Wait but if the problem didn't mention Blue before, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe first 8 days only Brown works. Then, next 6 days only Black works. Then Blue finishes. \n\nYes, that gives us the prior calculation of 11 days, which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that all three are working until Brown leaves. But that led to 3 houses done in 8 days, so that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe after Brown leaves, both Black and Blue work together for 6 days, then Blue finishes alone. Let's try that.\n\nFirst 8 days: Mr. Brown works alone. 8*(1/6) =4/3.\n\nThen, next 6 days: both Black and Blue work. Their combined rate is 1/8 +1/12 =5/24 per day. 6 days: 5/24 *6 = 30/24 =5/4 =1.25. Total after that: 4/3 +5/4 = (16/12 +15/12)=31/12 \u22482.5833. Remaining: 3 -31/12= (36/12 -31/12)=5/12. Then Blue paints that at 1/12 per day, so 5 days. But that's not among the options. The options are 7,8,10,11,12. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, so that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe after Mr. Brown leaves, only Mr. Blue is working? But the problem says Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. So that would mean that Mr. Black starts working for 6 days, and then Mr. Blue has to finish. But during those 6 days, who is working with Mr. Black? If it's just him, then:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown paints 4/3.\n\nThen, next 6 days: Black paints 6*(1/8)= 3/4. Total: 4/3+3/4 =25/12. Remaining 11/12. So Blue needs 11 days, which is D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Mr. Brown leaves, both Black and Blue work together for 6 days. Then the remaining would be less, but as before, that led to 5 days which isn't an option. \n\nHmm, the problem's wording is a bit ambiguous, but given the options, D)11 is an option and the calculation under the first scenario gives that. Let me check if there's another possible interpretation where the answer is different.\n\nAnother possible way: Maybe the first 8 days, all three are working except Mr. Black? Like, Mr. Brown and Blue are working. Wait, but why would Black not be working then?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different structure. Let me try to think of all three working together until day 8, then Brown leaves, so Black and Blue continue. But the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\"\u2014so perhaps he wasn't working before. So the first 8 days, only Brown and Blue were working. Let me see:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown and Blue. Their combined rate: 1/6 +1/12 = (2+1)/12 = 3/12 =1/4 per day. 8 days gives 2 houses. Then, Mr. Brown leaves. Then, Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. If he works alone, then he paints 6*(1/8) = 0.75. Total done: 2.75. Remaining: 0.25. So Blue would need 0.25 / (1/12) = 3 days. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, during the 6 days, Black and Blue work together. Their rate is 1/8 +1/12 =5/24 per day. 6 days: 5/24 *6 =30/24 =1.25. Total done 2+1.25=3.25. Over the contract. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me try to see if the problem might have a different structure where the answer is different. Let me re-express the problem again.\n\nThe problem states that after 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, and then Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. How long will it take Blue to finish. So the key is that the total work is 3 houses, and the work done in each phase must be added up.\n\nAssuming that in the first 8 days, only Mr. Brown is working, then Mr. Black works alone for 6 days, and then Blue does the rest. That gives 11 days, which is option D. Since that's an option and the math checks out, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that all three are working during the first 8 days, but that leads to completion, so that can't be. Hence, the correct answer must be D)11.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many days Mr. Blue will need to complete the contract, we analyze the work done in each phase:\n\n1. **First 8 days**: Only Mr. Brown is working.  \n   - Mr. Brown's rate: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) house/day.  \n   - Work done: \\( 8 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3} \\) houses.  \n\n2. **Next 6 days**: Mr. Black starts working alone after Mr. Brown leaves.  \n   - Mr. Black's rate: \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) house/day.  \n   - Work done: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} \\) houses.  \n\n3. **Total work completed after both phases**:  \n   - \\( \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{16}{12} + \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{25}{12} \\) houses.  \n\n4. **Remaining work**:  \n   - Total required: 3 houses \\( = \\frac{36}{12} \\).  \n   - Remaining: \\( \\frac{36}{12} - \\frac{25}{12} = \\frac{11}{12} \\) houses.  \n\n5. **Mr. Blue's time to complete the remaining work**:  \n   - Mr. Blue's rate: \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) house/day.  \n   - Time needed: \\( \\frac{11}{12} \\div \\frac{1}{12} = 11 \\) days.  \n\nThus, the answer is **D)11**.\n\nAnswer: D",

Then, after that, Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. His rate is 1/8 per day. So in 6 days, he paints 6*(1/8)=6/8=3/4 of a house. Then, the total painted so far is 4/3 + 3/4. Let me compute that: 4/3 is about 1.333..., and 3/4 is 0.75, so together that's 2.083... houses. Since the total needed is 3, the remaining would be 3 - 2.083... \u2248 0.916... houses. Then Mr. Blue has to paint that remaining part at 1/12 per day, so time needed is (remaining)/ (1/12) = (11/12)/(1/12) = 11 days? Wait, but 3 - (4/3 + 3/4) is let's compute exactly.\n\nLet me do the fractions properly. 4/3 + 3/4 = (16/12 + 9/12) = 25/12. So total painted is 25/12. The total needed is 3, which is 36/12. So remaining is 36/12 -25/12 =11/12. So 11/12 divided by (1/12 per day) is indeed 11 days. So the answer would be D)11? But wait, let me check if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nBut hold on, maybe the initial 8 days involved all three working together? Let me see. If that were the case, their combined rate would be (1/6 + 1/8 +1/12) per day. Let me compute that. Let's find a common denominator, which would be 24. So 4/24 + 3/24 + 2/24 = 9/24 = 3/8 per day. So in 8 days, they would paint 8*(3/8) = 3 houses. Wait, that's exactly the total needed. So if all three were working together for 8 days, they would finish all three houses, so there would be nothing left. But then the question's scenario of Mr. Black working for 6 days and then Blue finishing doesn't make sense. So that must not be the case. Therefore, the initial interpretation must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so maybe the initial 8 days only involve Mr. Brown and another worker? Or perhaps the problem is structured such that each painter is assigned to a different house. For example, Mr. Brown paints one house, Mr. Black another, and Mr. Blue the third. But the problem says the company contracts to paint 3 houses, so maybe each painter is working on a separate house. But the problem mentions that after 8 days Mr. Brown leaves. So let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the three painters are all working on the same houses, but the problem is about how much they can paint collectively over time.\n\nWait, let me re-express the problem again step by step. The company has to paint 3 houses. The time taken by each painter per house is given. The sequence of work is:\n\n1. For the first 8 days, some workers are working. The problem says \"after 8 days Mr. Brown goes on vacation\", which implies that he was working before that. The problem doesn't mention others, so maybe only Mr. Brown was working for the first 8 days. Then, after those 8 days, he leaves. Then, Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. The problem says \"begins to work for a period of 6 days\"\u2014so perhaps he starts working then and works for 6 days, but who else is working during that time?\n\nWait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me see the possible interpretations again.\n\nInterpretation 1: \n\n- First 8 days: Only Mr. Brown is working. Then he leaves. Then Mr. Black works alone for 6 days. Then Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work alone. That's the first scenario.\n\nInterpretation 2:\n\n- First 8 days: All three are working together. Then Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black continues (maybe with Blue?) but the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\"\u2014if he was already working, then \"begins\" is confusing. So that might not be the case.\n\nInterpretation 3:\n\n- Maybe the first 8 days, Mr. Brown and Mr. Black are working together, then Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black works with Mr. Blue for 6 days? But the problem states that Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days, so perhaps he was not working before?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the first 8 days, only Mr. Brown is working. Then, after that, Mr. Black starts working (so now both Mr. Brown and Black? But Brown left?), no, Brown went on vacation. So after 8 days, Mr. Brown is gone. Then, Mr. Black starts working alone for 6 days. Then, after those 6 days, Mr. Blue must finish the job. \n\nThis seems to make sense. So let's recalculate under that scenario.\n\nFirst 8 days: Mr. Brown paints 8*(1/6) = 8/6 = 4/3 houses. \n\nThen, next 6 days: Mr. Black works alone, so 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 houses.\n\nTotal painted after these periods: 4/3 + 3/4 = (16/12 + 9/12) = 25/12 \u2248 2.0833 houses.\n\nTotal needed is 3, so remaining work is 3 - 25/12 = (36/12 -25/12)=11/12 of a house.\n\nMr. Blue's rate is 1/12 per day. So time needed is (11/12) / (1/12) = 11 days. So the answer would be D)11.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\". If he was not working before, then that's correct. But what about Mr. Blue? Is he working during any of these periods?\n\nAh, here's another possible mistake. Maybe during the first 8 days, both Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue were working, and then after that, Mr. Black starts. Wait, the problem doesn't mention Mr. Blue at all except in the end. Hmm, maybe the problem is that all three are working together until Mr. Brown leaves, then Mr. Black works alone? Wait, the problem's wording is unclear. Let me read the problem again:\n\nOriginal problem:\n\n\"A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nSo the key points:\n\n- The company is painting 3 houses.\n\n- Each painter has their own rate.\n\n- After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation.\n\n- Then, Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days.\n\nThe problem is asking how many days Mr. Blue needs to complete the contract.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the \"contract\" requires painting all three houses, so all the work done so far plus the remaining work must equal three houses. The problem is structured as:\n\nThe work is done in three phases:\n\n1. First phase: 8 days with some workers (probably Mr. Brown and others? Or just Brown?)\n\n2. Second phase: 6 days with Mr. Black (and maybe others?)\n\n3. Third phase: Mr. Blue works alone until completion.\n\nBut the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\" after Brown leaves. So perhaps before that, Mr. Black wasn't working. So the first 8 days, perhaps only Mr. Brown was working, then after he leaves, Mr. Black starts working for 6 days (alone?), then Mr. Blue has to finish. That's the same as the first scenario.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in the first phase, Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue were working, then Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts. But the problem doesn't mention Mr. Blue's involvement before that. Hmm, this is a problem with the question's wording. \n\nAlternatively, maybe all three were working together in the first 8 days. Let's try that.\n\nFirst 8 days: All three working together. Their combined rate is (1/6 + 1/8 +1/12). Let me compute that again:\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n1/6 = 4/24, 1/8=3/24, 1/12=2/24. Sum is 9/24 = 3/8 per day. So in 8 days, they do 8*(3/8)=3 houses. That's exactly the total needed, so the contract would be done in 8 days. But then after that, Mr. Brown leaves, and then Mr. Black works for 6 days, but the work is already done. So that can't be. So this scenario is invalid.\n\nHence, the first interpretation must be the correct one: Only Mr. Brown is working for the first 8 days. Then, Mr. Black starts working alone for 6 days. Then, the remaining work is done by Mr. Blue.\n\nWait but why would the problem mention Mr. Blue at all then? Unless Mr. Blue is part of the initial team? Hmm. Alternatively, maybe after Mr. Black's 6 days, Mr. Blue is the only one left to finish. So the problem is that the total work is 3 houses. Let me confirm again the math:\n\nFirst phase (8 days): Mr. Brown paints 8*(1/6) = 4/3 \u22481.333 houses.\n\nSecond phase (6 days): Mr. Black paints 6*(1/8)= 0.75 houses. Total so far: ~2.083 houses. Remaining: ~0.9167, which is 11/12. \n\nMr. Blue paints at 1/12 per day, so 11/12 divided by 1/12 is 11 days. So the answer is D)11.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects that all three are working together for the first 8 days except when someone leaves. Wait, perhaps the first 8 days, all three are working, then Mr. Brown leaves, and then Mr. Black and Mr. Blue work together for 6 days? Then Mr. Blue has to finish alone?\n\nWait, the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\". If he was already working, then \"begins\" might not make sense. So perhaps he wasn't working before. So during the first 8 days, only Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue were working? Let me try that.\n\nSuppose first 8 days: Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue are working. Their combined rate is 1/6 +1/12 = (2/12 +1/12)= 3/12=1/4 per day. So in 8 days, they paint 8*(1/4) = 2 houses. Then, after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves. Then Mr. Black starts working (so now, is he working with Mr. Blue?) The problem states that Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. So perhaps during those 6 days, Mr. Black and Mr. Blue work together. Their combined rate would be 1/8 +1/12. Let's compute that: 3/24 + 2/24 =5/24 per day. Over 6 days, that's 6*(5/24)=30/24=5/4=1.25 houses. Total painted so far would be 2+1.25=3.25. But the contract is only 3 houses, so that's over. So that can't be right. Hmm, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps during the 6 days after Mr. Brown leaves, only Mr. Black is working, and Mr. Blue hasn't started yet. Then, after those 6 days, it's Mr. Blue's turn. Let's recalculate:\n\nFirst phase (8 days): Mr. Brown and Blue working. Wait but if the problem didn't mention Blue before, maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe first 8 days only Brown works. Then, next 6 days only Black works. Then Blue finishes. \n\nYes, that gives us the prior calculation of 11 days, which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that all three are working until Brown leaves. But that led to 3 houses done in 8 days, so that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe after Brown leaves, both Black and Blue work together for 6 days, then Blue finishes alone. Let's try that.\n\nFirst 8 days: Mr. Brown works alone. 8*(1/6) =4/3.\n\nThen, next 6 days: both Black and Blue work. Their combined rate is 1/8 +1/12 =5/24 per day. 6 days: 5/24 *6 = 30/24 =5/4 =1.25. Total after that: 4/3 +5/4 = (16/12 +15/12)=31/12 \u22482.5833. Remaining: 3 -31/12= (36/12 -31/12)=5/12. Then Blue paints that at 1/12 per day, so 5 days. But that's not among the options. The options are 7,8,10,11,12. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, so that can't be right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe after Mr. Brown leaves, only Mr. Blue is working? But the problem says Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. So that would mean that Mr. Black starts working for 6 days, and then Mr. Blue has to finish. But during those 6 days, who is working with Mr. Black? If it's just him, then:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown paints 4/3.\n\nThen, next 6 days: Black paints 6*(1/8)= 3/4. Total: 4/3+3/4 =25/12. Remaining 11/12. So Blue needs 11 days, which is D.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after Mr. Brown leaves, both Black and Blue work together for 6 days. Then the remaining would be less, but as before, that led to 5 days which isn't an option. \n\nHmm, the problem's wording is a bit ambiguous, but given the options, D)11 is an option and the calculation under the first scenario gives that. Let me check if there's another possible interpretation where the answer is different.\n\nAnother possible way: Maybe the first 8 days, all three are working except Mr. Black? Like, Mr. Brown and Blue are working. Wait, but why would Black not be working then?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different structure. Let me try to think of all three working together until day 8, then Brown leaves, so Black and Blue continue. But the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\"\u2014so perhaps he wasn't working before. So the first 8 days, only Brown and Blue were working. Let me see:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown and Blue. Their combined rate: 1/6 +1/12 = (2+1)/12 = 3/12 =1/4 per day. 8 days gives 2 houses. Then, Mr. Brown leaves. Then, Mr. Black starts working for 6 days. If he works alone, then he paints 6*(1/8) = 0.75. Total done: 2.75. Remaining: 0.25. So Blue would need 0.25 / (1/12) = 3 days. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, during the 6 days, Black and Blue work together. Their rate is 1/8 +1/12 =5/24 per day. 6 days: 5/24 *6 =30/24 =1.25. Total done 2+1.25=3.25. Over the contract. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, this is getting frustrating. Let me try to see if the problem might have a different structure where the answer is different. Let me re-express the problem again.\n\nThe problem states that after 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, and then Mr. Black begins to work for 6 days. How long will it take Blue to finish. So the key is that the total work is 3 houses, and the work done in each phase must be added up.\n\nAssuming that in the first 8 days, only Mr. Brown is working, then Mr. Black works alone for 6 days, and then Blue does the rest. That gives 11 days, which is option D. Since that's an option and the math checks out, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that all three are working during the first 8 days, but that leads to completion, so that can't be. Hence, the correct answer must be D)11.\n\n\nTo determine how many days Mr. Blue will need to complete the contract, we analyze the work done in each phase:\n\n1. **First 8 days**: Only Mr. Brown is working.  \n   - Mr. Brown's rate: \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) house/day.  \n   - Work done: \\( 8 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{8}{6} = \\frac{4}{3} \\) houses.  \n\n2. **Next 6 days**: Mr. Black starts working alone after Mr. Brown leaves.  \n   - Mr. Black's rate: \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) house/day.  \n   - Work done: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{6}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} \\) houses.  \n\n3. **Total work completed after both phases**:  \n   - \\( \\frac{4}{3} + \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{16}{12} + \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{25}{12} \\) houses.  \n\n4. **Remaining work**:  \n   - Total required: 3 houses \\( = \\frac{36}{12} \\).  \n   - Remaining: \\( \\frac{36}{12} - \\frac{25}{12} = \\frac{11}{12} \\) houses.  \n\n5. **Mr. Blue's time to complete the remaining work**:  \n   - Mr. Blue's rate: \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) house/day.  \n   - Time needed: \\( \\frac{11}{12} \\div \\frac{1}{12} = 11 \\) days.  \n\nThus, the answer is **D)11**.\n\nAnswer: D",

The company has to paint 3 houses. The question is asking how many days Mr. Blue will need to complete the contract after certain events happen with the other two.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the information. Let's start by understanding each person's painting rate. \n\nMr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days. So his rate is 1 house per 6 days, which I can write as 1/6 per day. Similarly, Mr. Black takes 8 days, so his rate is 1/8 per day, and Mr. Blue is 1/12 per day. \n\nThe problem says that after 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, and then Mr. Black works for 6 days.

Let me try this approach.\n\nWait, let me try to structure the problem step by step:\n\n1. The company has to paint 3 houses.\n\n2. The first phase: For the first 8 days, Mr. Brown is working alone. Then he goes on vacation.\n\n3. After that, Mr. Black works for 6 days. \n\n4. Then, the remaining work is to be done by Mr. Blue, and we need to find how many days he needs.\n\nWait, but that might be possible. Let's see.\n\nBut why would Mr. Black start working only after 8 days? The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" So perhaps Mr. Black wasn't working before. So the initial 8 days, only Mr. Brown was working. Then, after that, Mr. Black works for 6 days, and then the remaining work is done by Mr. Blue. But then, what about Mr. Blue? Was he working in the first 8 days? The problem doesn't mention him, so perhaps he wasn't. Alternatively, maybe all three are working together for the first 8 days, then Mr. Brown leaves, and then Mr. Black works for 6 days. But that would imply that Mr. Black was already working before, so \"begins to work\" would not fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as follows:\n\nThe company starts with Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue working together for the first 8 days. Then, Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts working (alongside Blue?), for 6 days. Wait, but the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" So perhaps during those 6 days, only Mr. Black and Mr. Blue are working? Or is Mr. Blue still working?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, and then Mr. Black starts working (maybe with Mr. Blue?) for 6 days. Then, after those 6 days, Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work alone. Wait, but the question says \"how many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\" So maybe after those 6 days of Mr. Black's work, the remaining job is done by Blue alone. So the total work is 3 houses. Let me try to model this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me define the work rates:\n\n- Mr. Brown's rate: 1 house per 6 days \u2192 1/6 per day.\n\n- Mr. Black's rate: 1/8 per day.\n\n- Mr. Blue's rate: 1/12 per day.\n\nAssuming the initial 8 days are all three working together? Or only some of them?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the company starts with Mr. Brown working alone for 8 days, then he goes on vacation. Then, Mr. Black starts working (alone?) for 6 days, then after that, Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work. But then where is Mr. Blue in the initial period?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the company has three workers, and the work is being done in phases:\n\nPhase 1: Mr. Brown works alone for 8 days.\n\nPhase 2: Then, Mr. Black works alone for 6 days.\n\nThen, the remaining work is done by Mr. Blue, and we need to find the days needed for Blue.\n\nBut that might be the case. Let's try this approach first.\n\nSo total work needed is 3 houses.\n\nPhase 1: Mr. Brown works for 8 days. His rate is 1/6 per day. So in 8 days, he paints 8*(1/6) = 8/6 = 4/3 houses. So after 8 days, 4/3 houses done. Remaining: 3 - 4/3 = 5/3 houses left.\n\nPhase 2: Mr. Black works for 6 days. His rate is 1/8 per day. So he paints 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 houses. Subtract that from remaining: 5/3 - 3/4 = (20/12 - 9/12) = 11/12 houses left.\n\nThen, Mr. Blue needs to paint the remaining 11/12 houses. His rate is 1/12 per day. So time needed would be (11/12) / (1/12) = 11 days. That would be option D. But let me check if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem requires that all three are working together in the first 8 days. Let me see.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nSuppose all three are working together for the first 8 days. Then, after that, Mr. Brown leaves, so only Black and Blue work for some time? But the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\". Hmm, perhaps after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, and then Mr. Black works alone for 6 days (so maybe Mr. Blue wasn't working before? That doesn't make sense because the problem states the company has to paint 3 houses, so maybe all three were working together first, then Brown leaves, and then Black and Blue work for 6 days together? Or perhaps Black starts working, but Blue was already there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the initial workers were only Brown and Blue. Then after 8 days, Brown leaves, and Black starts working with Blue for 6 days. Then, after that, Blue continues alone?\n\nWait, the problem is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to parse the problem again:\n\nOriginal problem statement:\n\n\"A company contracts to paint 3 houses. Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nThe key is the sequence of events. The problem says \"After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\"\n\nSo, the events are:\n\n1. Initially, some workers are painting. After 8 days, two things happen: Brown goes on vacation, and Black begins to work (presumably for 6 days). \n\nThe phrase \"begins to work\" suggests that Black was not working before those 8 days. So the initial 8 days must have been without Black. So who was working before?\n\nPossibly, only Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue were working for the first 8 days. Then, after those 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts working (along with Blue?), for 6 days. Then, after those 6 days, the remaining work is done by Blue alone. \n\nAlternatively, maybe only Brown was working for the first 8 days, then he leaves, and then Black starts working (with Blue? Or alone?).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the company starts with all three working, but the first 8 days is the time when Brown is working, then he leaves, and then Black works for 6 days, but the problem's wording is unclear.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of different scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: The first 8 days, only Brown is working. Then he leaves, and Black works alone for 6 days. Then Blue has to finish the rest. That would be the first calculation I did earlier, leading to 11 days, which is option D. But in that case, Blue wasn't involved until the end. But the problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses\"\u2014maybe all three are part of the company's workforce, so maybe they are all working together from the start?\n\nScenario 2: All three work together for the first 8 days. Then Brown leaves, and Black continues working for 6 days (with Blue?), and then Blue finishes.\n\nWait, let's try that scenario.\n\nFirst 8 days with all three:\n\nCombined rate: (1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12) per day.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's find a common denominator, say 24.\n\n1/6 = 4/24, 1/8 = 3/24, 1/12 = 2/24. Sum is 4+3+2=9/24 = 3/8 per day.\n\nSo in 8 days, they paint 8*(3/8) = 3 houses. Wait, that's exactly the total needed. But then there's no need for anyone else. But that can't be right because the question is asking how long Blue needs to finish. So this scenario can't be correct because the work is already done in 8 days, which contradicts the problem's setup.\n\nHmm, so that scenario is invalid. So maybe the first scenario where only Brown was working for the first 8 days.\n\nWait, but then the total work is 3 houses. Let me recalculate that.\n\nScenario 1:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown works alone.\n\nHe paints 8*(1/6) = 4/3 houses. Remaining: 3 - 4/3 = 5/3.\n\nThen, Mr. Black works for 6 days alone. He paints 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4.\n\nSubtracting: 5/3 - 3/4. Let's compute:\n\nConvert to twelfths: 5/3 is 20/12, 3/4 is 9/12. 20-9 =11/12.\n\nSo remaining is 11/12. Then Blue paints at 1/12 per day, so time needed is (11/12)/(1/12) =11 days. So D)11. That would be the answer. \n\nBut then why is Blue not mentioned in the first two phases? The problem states that the company has contracted to paint the houses, so maybe Blue was part of the team all along, but the problem didn't mention it. Wait, perhaps the problem is structured such that initially, Brown and Blue were working together for the first 8 days, then Brown leaves, and Black joins Blue for 6 days. Then, after those 6 days, Blue continues alone?\n\nLet me try that scenario.\n\nScenario 3:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown and Blue work together.\n\nTheir combined rate: (1/6 + 1/12) = (2/12 + 1/12) = 3/12 = 1/4 per day.\n\nIn 8 days, they paint 8*(1/4) = 2 houses. Remaining work: 1 house.\n\nThen, next phase: Black and Blue work for 6 days. Their combined rate: (1/8 + 1/12). Let's compute:\n\nCommon denominator 24: 3/24 + 2/24 =5/24 per day. \n\nOver 6 days: 6*(5/24) =30/24 =5/4 houses. But that's more than the remaining 1 house. Wait, that would overpaint. So this can't be correct.\n\nHmm, so this scenario doesn't work either. So perhaps the initial scenario 1 is correct, but that requires that Blue wasn't working in the first 8 days. The problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses,\" so maybe the company uses different workers in different phases. The problem might be that the initial workers were only Brown, then after 8 days, he leaves, and then Black works for 6 days, and then Blue is the only one left to finish. That would make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after the 8 days, Mr. Black starts working along with Blue, but the problem says \"begins to work for a period of 6 days\", which could mean that he works alone for those 6 days, and then Blue takes over. \n\nAlternatively, the problem could have the following timeline:\n\nThe company starts with all three working together. After 8 days, Brown leaves. Then, Mr. Black works for 6 days (but does Blue continue working?). The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\"\u2014maybe he was not working before, so perhaps the first 8 days were only Brown and Blue. Then, after those 8 days, Black starts working (with Blue?), for 6 days. Then the remaining work is done by Blue alone. Let me try this.\n\nScenario 4:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown and Blue working.\n\nTheir rate is (1/6 +1/12)= 1/4 per day. 8 days: 2 houses done. Remaining:1.\n\nThen, next phase: Black and Blue work for 6 days. Their combined rate: 1/8 +1/12 = (3/24 + 2/24)=5/24 per day. Over 6 days: 6*(5/24)=30/24=5/4 houses. But that would mean they painted more than the remaining 1 house. So that's impossible. So this scenario can't be correct.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think again. The problem's wording is key. The problem says:\n\n\"Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nThe key part is \"After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\"\n\nSo the first part: after 8 days, two things happen: Brown leaves, and Black begins to work. The wording \"begins to work\" implies that he wasn't working before. So prior to those 8 days, he wasn't working. So the initial workers must have been Brown and Blue (since the company is doing the work, and Black wasn't working until after 8 days). \n\nSo the first 8 days: Brown and Blue working together.\n\nTheir combined rate is (1/6 +1/12)= (2/12 +1/12)= 3/12=1/4 per day. So in 8 days, they paint 8*(1/4)=2 houses. So remaining work is 3-2=1 house.\n\nThen, after the 8 days, Mr. Black starts working. The problem says he begins to work for a period of 6 days. Now, the question is: during those 6 days, is he working alone, or with Blue?\n\nThe problem states that after those 6 days, Mr. Blue has to complete the contract. So maybe during the 6 days, Black is working alone? Because if Blue is still there, then after those 6 days, there might still be work left for both, but the question says it's Mr. Blue who completes it. Alternatively, perhaps after those 6 days, Blue is the only one left.\n\nWait, let me parse it again. The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" After that period (6 days), the contract is still not done, so Mr. Blue has to finish it. So during those 6 days, Black is working, but who else is working with him?\n\nThe problem didn't mention Blue leaving, so perhaps Blue is still working with Black during those 6 days. Then after those 6 days, maybe both Black and Blue stop, and Blue has to finish alone? That might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps after the 6 days, Black stops, and Blue continues alone.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be that after the 8 days, when Brown leaves, Black starts working (with Blue?), and they work together for 6 days. Then after that, only Blue is left to finish. Let me try that.\n\nSo after the initial 8 days (Brown and Blue painted 2 houses), remaining is 1 house.\n\nThen, for the next 6 days, Black and Blue work together. Their combined rate is (1/8 +1/12) = (3/24 + 2/24)=5/24 per day. Over 6 days: 6*(5/24)=30/24=5/4. But that's more than the remaining 1 house. So that would mean they finish the job in less than 6 days, which would leave the question's answer as less than 6 days, but the problem says after those 6 days, Blue has to complete it, which contradicts. Hence that can't be right.\n\nHmm, so maybe during those 6 days, Black is working alone. Let's try that scenario.\n\nAfter 8 days, remaining work is 1 house. \n\nThen, Mr. Black starts working alone for 6 days. His rate is 1/8 per day. So he paints 6*(1/8)= 6/8= 3/4. \n\nSubtracting from remaining: 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 house left. \n\nThen, Mr. Blue must paint the remaining 1/4. His rate is 1/12 per day. \n\nTime required: (1/4)/(1/12) = (1/4)*12 = 3 days. But that's not among the options. The options are 7,8,10,11,12. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, so this approach isn't working. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the first 8 days have all three working. Let me try that again even though earlier calculation suggested that 3 houses would be done in 8 days. Let me recalculate the combined rate.\n\nCombined rate of all three: (1/6 +1/8 +1/12). Let's compute:\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n1/6 =4/24, 1/8=3/24, 1/12=2/24. Sum is 4+3+2=9/24 = 3/8 per day.\n\nOver 8 days: 8*(3/8)=3 houses. Exactly the contract. So that would mean all work is done in 8 days. But the problem says that after those 8 days, Brown leaves and Black works for 6 days. That suggests that the work wasn't completed. So that scenario is invalid. So maybe the first 8 days are not with all three.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the first 8 days are only Brown working, then after that, Black works for 6 days, and then Blue has to finish. Let me recalculate that scenario again:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown paints 8*(1/6)= 4/3 houses. Remaining: 3-4/3=5/3.\n\nThen, Black works for 6 days alone: 6*(1/8)= 3/4. Subtract: 5/3 - 3/4 = (20/12 - 9/12)=11/12.\n\nThen Blue needs to paint 11/12 at his rate of 1/12 per day: 11 days. So that's answer D)11. \n\nBut in that case, Blue wasn't working in the first two phases. The problem says the company contracts to paint the houses. So perhaps Blue was part of the team, but the problem didn't mention it? Or maybe the company uses different workers in different phases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the first 8 days, only Brown is working, and Blue starts working with him after day 8? No, the problem says Mr. Black starts working after 8 days. So perhaps the problem assumes that only one worker is assigned at a time?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the company is using different workers in sequence. Like first Brown works for 8 days, then Black works for 6 days, then Blue works until done. \n\nIn that case, the total work done by Brown: 8*(1/6)=4/3. Black does 6*(1/8)= 3/4. Total so far: 4/3 + 3/4 = (16/12 +9/12)=25/12. \n\nTotal needed is 3 = 36/12. Remaining: 36/12 -25/12 =11/12. So Blue needs to paint 11/12, which at his rate takes 11 days. So that gives D)11, which is an option. \n\nTherefore, this must be the correct approach. The problem's wording is a bit ambiguous, but the key is that \"begins to work\" implies that Black wasn't working before, so the initial 8 days were only Brown, then Black works alone for 6 days, and then Blue takes over. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D)11.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine how many days Mr. Blue will take to complete the contract, we analyze the work done in phases:\n\n1. **First 8 days (Mr. Brown working alone):**  \n   Mr. Brown's rate is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) houses per day.  \n   Work completed: \\( 8 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{3} \\) houses.  \n   Remaining work: \\( 3 - \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\) houses.\n\n2. **Next 6 days (Mr. Black working alone):**  \n   Mr. Black's rate is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) houses per day.  \n   Work completed: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} \\) houses.  \n   Remaining work: \\( \\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{20}{12} - \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{11}{12} \\) houses.\n\n3. **Mr. Blue completes the remaining work:**  \n   Mr. Blue's rate is \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) houses per day.  \n   Time required: \\( \\frac{11}{12} \\div \\frac{1}{12} = 11 \\) days.\n\nThus, Mr. Blue needs **11 days** to finish the contract.\n\nAnswer: D",

Let's start by understanding each person's painting rate. \n\nMr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days. So his rate is 1 house per 6 days, which I can write as 1/6 per day.

Then, the remaining work is to be done by Mr. Blue, and we need to find how many days he needs.\n\nWait, but that might be possible. Let's see.\n\nBut why would Mr. Black start working only after 8 days? The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" So perhaps Mr. Black wasn't working before. So the initial 8 days, only Mr. Brown was working. Then, after that, Mr. Black works for 6 days, and then the remaining work is done by Mr. Blue. But then, what about Mr. Blue? Was he working in the first 8 days? The problem doesn't mention him, so perhaps he wasn't. Alternatively, maybe all three are working together for the first 8 days, then Mr. Brown leaves, and then Mr. Black works for 6 days. But that would imply that Mr. Black was already working before, so \"begins to work\" would not fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is structured as follows:\n\nThe company starts with Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue working together for the first 8 days. Then, Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts working (alongside Blue?), for 6 days.

Wait, but the question says \"how many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\" So maybe after those 6 days of Mr. Black's work, the remaining job is done by Blue alone. So the total work is 3 houses. Let me try to model this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me define the work rates:\n\n- Mr. Brown's rate: 1 house per 6 days \u2192 1/6 per day.\n\n- Mr. Black's rate: 1/8 per day.\n\n- Mr. Blue's rate: 1/12 per day.\n\nAssuming the initial 8 days are all three working together? Or only some of them?\n\nHmm, perhaps the problem is that the company starts with Mr. Brown working alone for 8 days, then he goes on vacation. Then, Mr. Black starts working (alone?) for 6 days, then after that, Mr. Blue has to finish the remaining work. But then where is Mr. Blue in the initial period?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the company has three workers, and the work is being done in phases:\n\nPhase 1: Mr. Brown works alone for 8 days.\n\nPhase 2: Then, Mr. Black works alone for 6 days.\n\nThen, the remaining work is done by Mr. Blue, and we need to find the days needed for Blue.\n\nBut that might be the case. Let's try this approach first.\n\nSo total work needed is 3 houses.\n\nPhase 1: Mr. Brown works for 8 days. His rate is 1/6 per day. So in 8 days, he paints 8*(1/6) = 8/6 = 4/3 houses. So after 8 days, 4/3 houses done. Remaining: 3 - 4/3 = 5/3 houses left.\n\nPhase 2: Mr. Black works for 6 days. His rate is 1/8 per day. So he paints 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 houses. Subtract that from remaining: 5/3 - 3/4 = (20/12 - 9/12) = 11/12 houses left.\n\nThen, Mr. Blue needs to paint the remaining 11/12 houses. His rate is 1/12 per day. So time needed would be (11/12) / (1/12) = 11 days. That would be option D. But let me check if that's the correct interpretation.\n\nWait, but maybe the problem requires that all three are working together in the first 8 days. Let me see.\n\nAlternative approach:\n\nSuppose all three are working together for the first 8 days. Then, after that, Mr. Brown leaves, so only Black and Blue work for some time? But the problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\". Hmm, perhaps after 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, and then Mr. Black works alone for 6 days (so maybe Mr. Blue wasn't working before? That doesn't make sense because the problem states the company has to paint 3 houses, so maybe all three were working together first, then Brown leaves, and then Black and Blue work for 6 days together? Or perhaps Black starts working, but Blue was already there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the initial workers were only Brown and Blue. Then after 8 days, Brown leaves, and Black starts working with Blue for 6 days. Then, after that, Blue continues alone?\n\nWait, the problem is a bit ambiguous.

Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nThe key is the sequence of events. The problem says \"After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\"\n\nSo, the events are:\n\n1. Initially, some workers are painting. After 8 days, two things happen: Brown goes on vacation, and Black begins to work (presumably for 6 days). \n\nThe phrase \"begins to work\" suggests that Black was not working before those 8 days. So the initial 8 days must have been without Black. So who was working before?\n\nPossibly, only Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue were working for the first 8 days. Then, after those 8 days, Mr. Brown leaves, and Mr. Black starts working (along with Blue?), for 6 days. Then, after those 6 days, the remaining work is done by Blue alone. \n\nAlternatively, maybe only Brown was working for the first 8 days, then he leaves, and then Black starts working (with Blue? Or alone?).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the company starts with all three working, but the first 8 days is the time when Brown is working, then he leaves, and then Black works for 6 days, but the problem's wording is unclear.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of different scenarios.\n\nScenario 1: The first 8 days, only Brown is working. Then he leaves, and Black works alone for 6 days. Then Blue has to finish the rest. That would be the first calculation I did earlier, leading to 11 days, which is option D. But in that case, Blue wasn't involved until the end. But the problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses\"\u2014maybe all three are part of the company's workforce, so maybe they are all working together from the start?\n\nScenario 2: All three work together for the first 8 days. Then Brown leaves, and Black continues working for 6 days (with Blue?), and then Blue finishes.\n\nWait, let's try that scenario.\n\nFirst 8 days with all three:\n\nCombined rate: (1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12) per day.\n\nLet me compute that. Let's find a common denominator, say 24.\n\n1/6 = 4/24, 1/8 = 3/24, 1/12 = 2/24. Sum is 4+3+2=9/24 = 3/8 per day.\n\nSo in 8 days, they paint 8*(3/8) = 3 houses. Wait, that's exactly the total needed. But then there's no need for anyone else. But that can't be right because the question is asking how long Blue needs to finish. So this scenario can't be correct because the work is already done in 8 days, which contradicts the problem's setup.\n\nHmm, so that scenario is invalid. So maybe the first scenario where only Brown was working for the first 8 days.\n\nWait, but then the total work is 3 houses. Let me recalculate that.\n\nScenario 1:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown works alone.\n\nHe paints 8*(1/6) = 4/3 houses. Remaining: 3 - 4/3 = 5/3.\n\nThen, Mr. Black works for 6 days alone. He paints 6*(1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4.\n\nSubtracting: 5/3 - 3/4. Let's compute:\n\nConvert to twelfths: 5/3 is 20/12, 3/4 is 9/12. 20-9 =11/12.\n\nSo remaining is 11/12. Then Blue paints at 1/12 per day, so time needed is (11/12)/(1/12) =11 days. So D)11. That would be the answer. \n\nBut then why is Blue not mentioned in the first two phases? The problem states that the company has contracted to paint the houses, so maybe Blue was part of the team all along, but the problem didn't mention it. Wait, perhaps the problem is structured such that initially, Brown and Blue were working together for the first 8 days, then Brown leaves, and Black joins Blue for 6 days. Then, after those 6 days, Blue continues alone?\n\nLet me try that scenario.\n\nScenario 3:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown and Blue work together.\n\nTheir combined rate: (1/6 + 1/12) = (2/12 + 1/12) = 3/12 = 1/4 per day.\n\nIn 8 days, they paint 8*(1/4) = 2 houses. Remaining work: 1 house.\n\nThen, next phase: Black and Blue work for 6 days. Their combined rate: (1/8 + 1/12). Let's compute:\n\nCommon denominator 24: 3/24 + 2/24 =5/24 per day. \n\nOver 6 days: 6*(5/24) =30/24 =5/4 houses. But that's more than the remaining 1 house. Wait, that would overpaint. So this can't be correct.\n\nHmm, so this scenario doesn't work either. So perhaps the initial scenario 1 is correct, but that requires that Blue wasn't working in the first 8 days. The problem says \"the company contracts to paint 3 houses,\" so maybe the company uses different workers in different phases. The problem might be that the initial workers were only Brown, then after 8 days, he leaves, and then Black works for 6 days, and then Blue is the only one left to finish. That would make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe after the 8 days, Mr. Black starts working along with Blue, but the problem says \"begins to work for a period of 6 days\", which could mean that he works alone for those 6 days, and then Blue takes over. \n\nAlternatively, the problem could have the following timeline:\n\nThe company starts with all three working together. After 8 days, Brown leaves. Then, Mr. Black works for 6 days (but does Blue continue working?). The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days\"\u2014maybe he was not working before, so perhaps the first 8 days were only Brown and Blue. Then, after those 8 days, Black starts working (with Blue?), for 6 days. Then the remaining work is done by Blue alone. Let me try this.\n\nScenario 4:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown and Blue working.\n\nTheir rate is (1/6 +1/12)= 1/4 per day. 8 days: 2 houses done. Remaining:1.\n\nThen, next phase: Black and Blue work for 6 days. Their combined rate: 1/8 +1/12 = (3/24 + 2/24)=5/24 per day. Over 6 days: 6*(5/24)=30/24=5/4 houses. But that would mean they painted more than the remaining 1 house. So that's impossible. So this scenario can't be correct.\n\nHmm, this is getting tricky. Let me think again. The problem's wording is key. The problem says:\n\n\"Mr.Brown can paint a house in 6 days while Mr.Black would take 8 days and Mr.Blue 12 days. After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days. How many days will it take Mr.Blue to complete the contract?\"\n\nThe key part is \"After 8 days Mr.Brown goes on vacation and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\"\n\nSo the first part: after 8 days, two things happen: Brown leaves, and Black begins to work. The wording \"begins to work\" implies that he wasn't working before. So prior to those 8 days, he wasn't working. So the initial workers must have been Brown and Blue (since the company is doing the work, and Black wasn't working until after 8 days). \n\nSo the first 8 days: Brown and Blue working together.\n\nTheir combined rate is (1/6 +1/12)= (2/12 +1/12)= 3/12=1/4 per day. So in 8 days, they paint 8*(1/4)=2 houses. So remaining work is 3-2=1 house.\n\nThen, after the 8 days, Mr. Black starts working. The problem says he begins to work for a period of 6 days. Now, the question is: during those 6 days, is he working alone, or with Blue?\n\nThe problem states that after those 6 days, Mr. Blue has to complete the contract. So maybe during the 6 days, Black is working alone? Because if Blue is still there, then after those 6 days, there might still be work left for both, but the question says it's Mr. Blue who completes it. Alternatively, perhaps after those 6 days, Blue is the only one left.\n\nWait, let me parse it again. The problem says \"Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.\" After that period (6 days), the contract is still not done, so Mr. Blue has to finish it. So during those 6 days, Black is working, but who else is working with him?\n\nThe problem didn't mention Blue leaving, so perhaps Blue is still working with Black during those 6 days. Then after those 6 days, maybe both Black and Blue stop, and Blue has to finish alone? That might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps after the 6 days, Black stops, and Blue continues alone.\n\nAlternatively, the problem could be that after the 8 days, when Brown leaves, Black starts working (with Blue?), and they work together for 6 days. Then after that, only Blue is left to finish. Let me try that.\n\nSo after the initial 8 days (Brown and Blue painted 2 houses), remaining is 1 house.\n\nThen, for the next 6 days, Black and Blue work together. Their combined rate is (1/8 +1/12) = (3/24 + 2/24)=5/24 per day. Over 6 days: 6*(5/24)=30/24=5/4. But that's more than the remaining 1 house. So that would mean they finish the job in less than 6 days, which would leave the question's answer as less than 6 days, but the problem says after those 6 days, Blue has to complete it, which contradicts. Hence that can't be right.\n\nHmm, so maybe during those 6 days, Black is working alone. Let's try that scenario.\n\nAfter 8 days, remaining work is 1 house. \n\nThen, Mr. Black starts working alone for 6 days. His rate is 1/8 per day. So he paints 6*(1/8)= 6/8= 3/4. \n\nSubtracting from remaining: 1 - 3/4 = 1/4 house left. \n\nThen, Mr. Blue must paint the remaining 1/4. His rate is 1/12 per day. \n\nTime required: (1/4)/(1/12) = (1/4)*12 = 3 days. But that's not among the options. The options are 7,8,10,11,12. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, so this approach isn't working. Maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Perhaps the first 8 days have all three working. Let me try that again even though earlier calculation suggested that 3 houses would be done in 8 days. Let me recalculate the combined rate.\n\nCombined rate of all three: (1/6 +1/8 +1/12). Let's compute:\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n1/6 =4/24, 1/8=3/24, 1/12=2/24. Sum is 4+3+2=9/24 = 3/8 per day.\n\nOver 8 days: 8*(3/8)=3 houses. Exactly the contract. So that would mean all work is done in 8 days. But the problem says that after those 8 days, Brown leaves and Black works for 6 days. That suggests that the work wasn't completed. So that scenario is invalid. So maybe the first 8 days are not with all three.\n\nHmm. So perhaps the first 8 days are only Brown working, then after that, Black works for 6 days, and then Blue has to finish. Let me recalculate that scenario again:\n\nFirst 8 days: Brown paints 8*(1/6)= 4/3 houses. Remaining: 3-4/3=5/3.\n\nThen, Black works for 6 days alone: 6*(1/8)= 3/4. Subtract: 5/3 - 3/4 = (20/12 - 9/12)=11/12.\n\nThen Blue needs to paint 11/12 at his rate of 1/12 per day: 11 days. So that's answer D)11. \n\nBut in that case, Blue wasn't working in the first two phases. The problem says the company contracts to paint the houses. So perhaps Blue was part of the team, but the problem didn't mention it? Or maybe the company uses different workers in different phases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe during the first 8 days, only Brown is working, and Blue starts working with him after day 8? No, the problem says Mr. Black starts working after 8 days. So perhaps the problem assumes that only one worker is assigned at a time?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the company is using different workers in sequence. Like first Brown works for 8 days, then Black works for 6 days, then Blue works until done. \n\nIn that case, the total work done by Brown: 8*(1/6)=4/3. Black does 6*(1/8)= 3/4. Total so far: 4/3 + 3/4 = (16/12 +9/12)=25/12. \n\nTotal needed is 3 = 36/12. Remaining: 36/12 -25/12 =11/12. So Blue needs to paint 11/12, which at his rate takes 11 days. So that gives D)11, which is an option. \n\nTherefore, this must be the correct approach. The problem's wording is a bit ambiguous, but the key is that \"begins to work\" implies that Black wasn't working before, so the initial 8 days were only Brown, then Black works alone for 6 days, and then Blue takes over. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D)11.\n\n\nTo determine how many days Mr. Blue will take to complete the contract, we analyze the work done in phases:\n\n1. **First 8 days (Mr. Brown working alone):**  \n   Mr. Brown's rate is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) houses per day.  \n   Work completed: \\( 8 \\times \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{4}{3} \\) houses.  \n   Remaining work: \\( 3 - \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{5}{3} \\) houses.\n\n2. **Next 6 days (Mr. Black working alone):**  \n   Mr. Black's rate is \\( \\frac{1}{8} \\) houses per day.  \n   Work completed: \\( 6 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{3}{4} \\) houses.  \n   Remaining work: \\( \\frac{5}{3} - \\frac{3}{4} = \\frac{20}{12} - \\frac{9}{12} = \\frac{11}{12} \\) houses.\n\n3. **Mr. Blue completes the remaining work:**  \n   Mr. Blue's rate is \\( \\frac{1}{12} \\) houses per day.  \n   Time required: \\( \\frac{11}{12} \\div \\frac{1}{12} = 11 \\) days.\n\nThus, Mr. Blue needs **11 days** to finish the contract.\n\nAnswer: D",
