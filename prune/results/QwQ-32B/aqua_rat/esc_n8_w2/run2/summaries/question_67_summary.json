      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The question is about figuring out how many grams of this health food someone needs to eat daily to get at least the minimum daily requirements for both vitamins E and A. Hmm, right. The problem states that one gram gives 9% of the daily E and 8% of the daily A. \n\nWait, so if someone eats x grams, then the total vitamin E would be 9% times x, and vitamin A would be 8% times x. They need both to be at least 100%, right? Because the minimum daily requirement is 100% for each. So we need to find the smallest x where both 9x \u2265 100 and 8x \u2265 100. \n\nLet me think. Let's write down the inequalities. For vitamin E, 0.09 * x \u2265 1 (assuming the minimum daily requirement is 1 unit, so 100%). Wait, maybe better to think in terms of percentages. Since 1 gram gives 9% E, then x grams would give 9x% of E. Similarly, 8x% of A. We need both of those to be at least 100%.\n\nSo, solving for x in each case. For E: 9x \u2265 100 \u2192 x \u2265 100/9. Let me calculate that. 100 divided by 9 is approximately 11.111... grams. For A, 8x \u2265100 \u2192 x \u2265 100/8 which is 12.5. \n\nOh, right! Because each vitamin requires a different amount. The minimum daily requirement for E would be met at 11.11 grams, but for A, you need 12.5 grams. So since the question says \"to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both\", the person has to eat enough to satisfy the higher of the two. Because if you take 12.5 grams, then E would have 9 *12.5 = 112.5%, which is over the requirement, but A would be exactly 100%. But if you took 11.11 grams, E would be okay but A would be only 88.88%, which is not enough. So the answer has to be 12.5 grams, which is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)8.5, B)10.5, C)12.5, D)14.5, E)16.5. So 12.5 is option C. That makes sense. Because the A requires more grams. So the answer must be C.\n",
