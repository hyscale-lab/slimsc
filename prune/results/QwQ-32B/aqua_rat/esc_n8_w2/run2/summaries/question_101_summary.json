      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I've got this ratio problem here. Let me see... The question is about a bag of red and green sweets. The ratio of red to green is 3:4, and there are 120 green sweets. I need to find out how many red sweets there are. Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but let's take it step by step.\n\nAlright, ratios compare quantities. So red to green is 3 to 4. That means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. The total parts would be 3 + 4 = 7 parts, but maybe I don't need the total. Since they gave me the number of green sweets, which is 120, I can set up a proportion here.\n\nLet me think. The ratio of red to green is 3:4. So if I let the number of red sweets be 3x and green be 4x, that might work. Because ratios can be scaled by a common factor. So 4x would equal the number of green sweets, which is 120. So solving for x first. \n\nSo 4x = 120. Then x would be 120 divided by 4. Let me calculate that. 120 divided by 4 is 30. So x is 30. Then the number of red sweets is 3 times x, which is 3 * 30. That's 90. So the answer should be 90, which is option A. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If the ratio is 3:4, then red is 3 parts and green is 4. So when green is 120, which is 4 parts, each part is 30. So 3 parts red would be 90. Yeah, that makes sense. Let me see if another approach gives the same result. \n\nAlternatively, the proportion could be set up as red/green = 3/4. So red over 120 equals 3/4. Then solving for red: red = (3/4)*120. Let's compute that. 3 divided by 4 is 0.75. 0.75 multiplied by 120. 0.75 times 100 is 75, and 0.75 times 20 is 15, so total 90. Yep, same answer. So that's consistent. \n\nI don't think I made a mistake here. The options include 90 as option A. So the answer must be A.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nThe problem states that the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. Given there are 120 green sweets, we can set up the ratio as red:green = 3:4. Let the number of red sweets be \\(3x\\) and green sweets be \\(4x\\). Since \\(4x = 120\\), solving for \\(x\\) gives \\(x = 30\\).

Hmm, ratios can sometimes trip me up, but let's take it step by step.\n\nSo, the ratio 3:4 means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green ones. That's like groups. So maybe I can think of them in groups of 3 red and 4 green. The total number of parts in the ratio would be 3 + 4 = 7, but I don't know if I need the total here. Wait, the question is only asking for red when given the number of green. Maybe I can set up a proportion.\n\nLet me write that down. Let R be the number of red sweets. The ratio of red to green is 3/4 = R/120, since green is 120. So cross-multiplying, 4R = 3 * 120. Let me calculate that. 3 times 120 is 360. So 4R = 360. Then R would be 360 divided by 4. Let me do that division. 360 divided by 4 is 90. So that would be 90 red sweets. So the answer should be A)90?\n\nWait, let me check again. The ratio is red to green 3:4. So if there are 4 parts green, and that's 120, each part must be 120 divided by 4, which is 30. Then red is 3 parts, so 3 times 30 is 90. Yeah, that matches. So A is the correct answer. I think that's right. Let me just make sure I didn't mix up the ratio. Like, sometimes people get confused which comes first. The problem says red to green is 3:4, so red first then green. So yes, 3 is red, 4 is green. So the calculation is correct. So the answer should be A)90.\n",
