      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The question is about simple interest. The professor borrowed 5000 rupees from the university, and after 3 years, the interest is 300. We need to find the rate per annum. Hmm.\n\nRight, the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P the principal, R the rate, and T the time in years. So here, they gave I as 300, P is 5000, T is 3. We have to find R.\n\nLet me plug the numbers in. So 300 equals 5000 multiplied by R multiplied by 3. Let me write that out: 300 = 5000 * R * 3. \n\nWait, so solving for R would mean dividing both sides by (5000*3). Let me calculate the denominator first. 5000 times 3 is 15,000. So R is 300 divided by 15,000. Let me do that division. 300 divided by 15,000. Hmm, 300 divided by 15 is 20, so 300 divided by 15,000 is 0.02. \n\nOh right, because 15,000 is 15 times 1000. So 300/15000 = 0.02. Then since R is in decimal, to get the percentage we multiply by 100. So 0.02 * 100 is 2%. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 2%, so that should be the answer. Wait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a calculation mistake.\n\nLet me recalculate. The interest over 3 years is 300. So per year, the interest would be 300 divided by 3, which is 100 per year. So each year, the interest is 100 on 5000. Then the rate is (100/5000)*100. Wait, that's (100/5000)*100%? Wait no, the rate is (Interest/Principal)/time. Wait, maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the annual interest is 100. Since simple interest is principal times rate, so 5000 * R = 100. So R = 100/5000 = 0.02, which is 2%. Yeah, same result. So the answer must be A) 2%.\n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are A)2%, B)8%, C)5%, D)10%, E)None. So A is there. So the correct answer is A. I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes here. The calculation steps all add up. So the answer should be A.\n",

Alright, I remember the formula for simple interest is I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P the principal, R the rate, and T the time in years. \n\nSo here, the principal (P) is 5000. The time (T) is 3 years. The interest (I) is 300. We need to find R. Let me plug the numbers into the formula. \n\nSo 300 = 5000 * R * 3. Let me rearrange that to solve for R. Dividing both sides by (5000 *3) should give R. Let me compute that. \n\nFirst, 5000 multiplied by 3 is 15000. So 300 divided by 15000 equals R. Let me do that division. 300 divided by 15000... Well, 15000 divided by 100 is 150, so 300 is 2 times 150. So 300 /15000 = 2/100, which is 0.02. So R is 0.02, which as a percentage is 2%. \n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. 5000 * 3 years is 15000. 300 divided by 15000 equals 0.02. Yes, that's 2%. So the rate is 2% per annum. \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 2%. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The question says the university got 300 on interest after 3 years. That's total interest, right? So yes, the simple interest formula gives exactly that. So yes, the calculation seems right. The options are A to E, with A being 2%. So the correct answer must be A. Hmm, but wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me check the formula again. \n\nSimple Interest formula is indeed I = (P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T)/100? Wait, wait a second. Oh right! Sometimes the formula is presented as I = PRT, where R is a decimal. Alternatively, sometimes people use the formula with R in percentage and then divide by 100. Let me clarify. \n\nWait, let me check again. Let's see: If the rate is 2%, then R in decimal is 0.02. So the formula would be I = P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T. So 5000 \u00d7 0.02 \u00d73 = 5000 \u00d70.06 = 300. Exactly matches. So that's correct. Alternatively, if someone uses the formula as I = (P \u00d7 R \u00d7 T)/100, then R would be in percentage terms. Let's try that way. \n\nSo plugging in: 300 = (5000 \u00d7 R \u00d73)/100. Multiply both sides by 100: 30000 = 5000 \u00d73 \u00d7 R. So 30000 =15000 R \u2192 R = 30000 /15000 =2. So R is 2%, which is same as before. So either way, it's 2%. So the answer is A. \n\nLooking at the options again: A is 2%, so that's correct. Therefore the answer should be option A.\n",
