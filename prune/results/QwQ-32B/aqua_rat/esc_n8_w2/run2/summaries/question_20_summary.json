      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this equation here: [5 plus something times 19 minus 15 minus 7] divided by [13 times 13 minus 156] equals 6. And I need to find what that \"something\" is from the options given. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I should probably rewrite the equation to make it clearer. The main equation is (5 + ? \u00d7 19 - 15 -7) divided by (13\u00d713 - 156) equals 6. Let me write that down more neatly:\n\n(Numerator) / (Denominator) = 6\n\nWhere numerator is 5 + ?\u00d719 -15 -7, and denominator is 13\u00d713 - 156.\n\nSo, my goal is to solve for the question mark. Let's denote the question mark as x for simplicity. So the equation becomes:\n\n(5 + x\u00d719 -15 -7) / (13\u00d713 - 156) = 6\n\nFirst, maybe I should compute the denominator first because that might simplify things. Let me calculate the denominator part first. \n\n13 multiplied by 13 is 169. Then subtract 156 from that. 169 minus 156 is... let's see, 169-150 is 19, then minus 6 more gives 13. So denominator is 13. \n\nSo now the equation is (numerator)/13 =6. That means the numerator must equal 6 multiplied by 13, right? Because if I multiply both sides by 13, the denominator cancels out. \n\n6 times 13 is 78. So the numerator must equal 78. \n\nNow the numerator is 5 + x\u00d719 -15 -7. Let me simplify that expression step by step. \n\nFirst, combine the constants. Let's see, 5 minus 15 minus 7. \n\n5 -15 is -10, then -10 -7 is -17. So the numerator simplifies to (x\u00d719) + (5 -15 -7) \u2192 which is 19x -17. \n\nWait, yes, exactly. So the numerator is 19x -17. \n\nWe set that equal to 78, so 19x -17 =78. \n\nNow, solving for x: add 17 to both sides. 19x = 78 +17. 78+17 is 95. \n\nSo 19x =95 \u2192 x=95 divided by 19. Let me calculate that. \n\n19 times 5 is 95, right? 19\u00d75=95. So x is 5. \n\nLooking at the options, option C is 5. So the answer must be C. \n\nWait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nStarting with the denominator: 13\u00d713 is 169, minus 156 is indeed 13. So that's correct. \n\nThen the numerator equation: 5 + x*19 -15 -7. \n\nYes, the constants: 5-15-7. 5-15 is -10, then -10-7 is -17. So the expression is 19x -17. \n\nSet equal to 78 (since denominator 13 times 6 is 78). \n\n19x -17 =78 \u2192 19x =95 \u2192 x=5. \n\nHmm, that seems right. The options given are A)4, B)4.5, C)5, D)5.5, E)6.5. \n\nSo the correct answer is C)5. \n\nI don't think I made any calculation errors here. Let me just recheck the numerator calculation again. Suppose x is 5, then plug back into numerator: 5 + (5\u00d719) -15 -7. \n\n5\u00d719 is 95. Then 5+95 is 100. 100 -15 is 85, 85-7 is 78. Yep, that's exactly the numerator needed. Then denominator 13, so 78/13 is 6, which matches the equation. \n\nAll steps check out. So the answer must be C.\n",
