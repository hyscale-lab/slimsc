      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The problem is asking what should replace the question mark in the equation: (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 times (?) equals (a - b)\u00b2. Hmm, right, so I need to solve for the question mark. Let me write down the equation first to visualize it better.\n\nSo the equation is: [ (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) / (a + b)\u00b2 ] * ? = (a - b)\u00b2. I need to find what the question mark is. \n\nFirst, maybe simplify the left side as much as possible. Let's see, the numerator a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 is a difference of squares. That factors into (a + b)(a - b). So substituting that in, the numerator becomes (a + b)(a - b). The denominator is (a + b) squared. So the fraction would be [(a + b)(a - b)] / (a + b)^2. \n\nWait, simplifying that fraction: the (a + b) in the numerator cancels with one of the (a + b) terms in the denominator. So that leaves (a - b)/(a + b). So the original fraction simplifies to (a - b)/(a + b). \n\nSo now the equation becomes: [ (a - b)/(a + b) ] * ? = (a - b)^2. \n\nNow, I need to solve for the question mark. Let me denote the question mark as X for clarity. Then the equation is ( (a - b)/(a + b) ) * X = (a - b)^2. \n\nTo solve for X, I can rearrange the equation: X = [ (a - b)^2 ] / [ (a - b)/(a + b) ) ] \n\nDividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So that would be (a - b)^2 multiplied by (a + b)/(a - b). \n\nLet me write that out: X = (a - b)^2 * (a + b) / (a - b). \n\nThe (a - b) in the denominator cancels with one of the (a - b) terms in the numerator. So that leaves (a - b) multiplied by (a + b). So (a - b)(a + b). \n\nWait a second, but (a - b)(a + b) is the same as a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. But let me check again. Wait, so after canceling, we have (a - b) * (a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. But that's the original numerator. Hmm, but let's see the options given. Let me look back at the options. \n\nThe options are: A is (a + b)(a - b), which is the same as a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. B is (a - b)^2, C is (a + b)^2, D is a\u00b3 + b\u00b3, E is none of these. \n\nWait, but according to my calculation, X is (a - b)*(a + b). So that would be option A. But wait, let me double-check the steps again because sometimes I might have messed up. \n\nStarting over: original equation is [(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2] * X = (a - b)^2. \n\nFirst step: a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 factors to (a + b)(a - b). So plug that in:\n\n[( (a + b)(a - b) ) / (a + b)^2 ] * X = (a - b)^2 \n\nThe (a + b) in numerator cancels one from denominator (a + b)^2, so denominator becomes (a + b). So the fraction becomes (a - b)/(a + b) * X = (a - b)^2. \n\nThen solving for X: multiply both sides by (a + b)/(a - b). So X = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)/(a - b) \n\nSimplify: (a - b) cancels one exponent, so (a - b) * (a + b) = (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2). \n\nSo X is (a + b)(a - b), which is option A. \n\nWait but hold on, let me check the problem again. The question says \"What should come in place of the question mark(?) in each of the following questions ? a2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2\". Wait, maybe the equation was written in a way that I might have misinterpreted the grouping. \n\nWait the original equation as written might be ambiguous. Let me parse the original question again. The user wrote:\n\na2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2\n\nWait that could be interpreted differently. Maybe the entire (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) is divided by (a + b) squared, then multiplied by the question mark? Because in the original problem statement, the way it's written might be (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/( (a + b)^2 ) multiplied by ? equals (a - b)^2. Which is how I interpreted it earlier. But perhaps there's another way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a2 - [ b2/(a + b)^2 ] * ? = (a - b)^2. But that would be a different equation. The way the user wrote the question might have the division only applying to the b\u00b2 term. But given that the standard way to present such problems, I think the first interpretation is correct. Because in such algebraic equations, the numerator and denominator are grouped. So the question's left-hand side is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2) divided by (a + b)^2 multiplied by the question mark, equals (a - b)^2. \n\nAssuming that's the case, then my previous solution holds. So the answer would be option A. \n\nWait but let me check the options again. Option A is (a + b)(a - b). Which is exactly what we got for X. So then the answer should be A. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra steps? Let me go through once more. \n\nOriginal equation:\n\n[(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2] * X = (a - b)^2 \n\nFactor numerator: (a + b)(a - b) over (a + b)^2. \n\nSo that reduces to (a - b)/(a + b) * X = (a - b)^2 \n\nMultiply both sides by (a + b)/(a - b):\n\nX = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)/(a - b) \n\nThe (a - b) in the denominator cancels with one (a - b) in the numerator, leaving (a - b)(a + b). \n\nYes, so that's correct. So the correct option is A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me plug in numbers to test. Let me pick a=3 and b=1. \n\nThen let's compute left side with the question mark being option A. \n\nOriginal equation: [ (3\u00b2 -1\u00b2) / (3+1)^2 ] * X = (3-1)^2 \n\nCompute numerator: 9 -1 = 8. Denominator: 16. So 8/16 = 0.5. \n\nMultiply by X (which is (3+1)(3-1)=4*2=8) gives 0.5 *8 =4. \n\nThe right side is (2)^2=4. So that works. \n\nIf I tried option B, which is (a -b)^2 = (2)^2 =4. So then the left side would be 0.5 *4=2, which is not 4. So that's wrong. \n\nOption C is (a + b)^2 =16. Then 0.5 *16=8, which is more than 4. Not correct. \n\nOption D: a^3 +b^3 =27 +1=28. 0.5 *28=14, no. \n\nSo the correct answer here is A. \n\nHmm, so why is the option E there? Maybe I made a mistake. But according to the test case, A works. \n\nWait the problem is written as \"a2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2\". Maybe there's a different grouping? Like perhaps the entire a2 - [b2/(a + b)^2] multiplied by ? equals (a - b)^2. But that would be a different equation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is written as (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/( (a + b)^2 * ? ) = (a - b)^2. But that would require different steps. Let me see the original problem's wording again. The user wrote: \n\n\"a2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2\"\n\nHmm, perhaps the formatting is unclear. The way it's written could be ambiguous. If the question mark is in the denominator, but the original problem's structure might be different. Let me parse it again. \n\nThe problem says: \n\nWhat should come in place of the question mark(?) in each of the following questions ?\na2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2\n\nMaybe the structure is (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/( (a + b)^2 ) multiplied by ? equals (a - b)^2. That's how I thought before. But perhaps the equation is written as:\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 * ? = (a - b)^2 \n\nWhich is the same as before.

So the equation becomes:\n\n(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2 * X = (a - b)\u00b2\n\nTo solve for X, I can isolate it by dividing both sides by (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2. So X would be equal to [(a - b)\u00b2] divided by [(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)\u00b2]. \n\nWait, dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. So that would be (a - b)\u00b2 multiplied by (a + b)\u00b2/(a\u00b2 - b\u00b2). \n\nNow, I remember that a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 factors into (a + b)(a - b). Let me substitute that in. So the denominator a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 becomes (a + b)(a - b). \n\nSo substituting that into the expression for X gives me: (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 / [(a + b)(a - b)]. \n\nNow let's simplify this. The numerator has (a + b)^2 and the denominator has (a + b), so one of the (a + b) terms cancels out. Similarly, the (a - b) in the denominator cancels with one (a - b) from the numerator's (a - b)^2. \n\nAfter cancellation, what's left is (a + b) * (a - b).

Let's write it step by step. \n\nOriginal expression after substitution: [(a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 ] / [ (a + b)(a - b) ]\n\nBreaking it down, the numerator is (a - b)^2 times (a + b)^2, and the denominator is (a + b) times (a - b). So each term in the denominator cancels one exponent from the numerator's terms. \n\nSo (a + b)^2 divided by (a + b) is (a + b)^(2-1) = (a + b)^1. Similarly, (a - b)^2 divided by (a - b) is (a - b)^1. \n\nTherefore, the result is (a + b)(a - b). \n\nLooking at the options, option A is (a + b)(a - b). So the answer should be A? Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach the original equation again. Let me plug in numbers for a and b to test.

The numerator has (a + b)^2 and the denominator has (a + b), so one of the (a + b) terms cancels out. Similarly, the (a - b) in the denominator cancels with one (a - b) from the numerator's (a - b)^2. \n\nAfter cancellation, what's left is (a + b) * (a - b). Because the numerator after factoring would be (a - b)^2*(a + b)^2 divided by (a + b)(a - b) equals (a + b)*(a - b). \n\nWait, let me check that again. Let's write it step by step. \n\nOriginal expression after substitution: [(a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2 ] / [ (a + b)(a - b) ]\n\nBreaking it down, the numerator is (a - b)^2 times (a + b)^2, and the denominator is (a + b) times (a - b). So each term in the denominator cancels one exponent from the numerator's terms. \n\nSo (a + b)^2 divided by (a + b) is (a + b)^(2-1) = (a + b)^1. Similarly, (a - b)^2 divided by (a - b) is (a - b)^1. \n\nTherefore, the result is (a + b)(a - b). \n\nLooking at the options, option A is (a + b)(a - b). So the answer should be A? Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach the original equation again. Let me plug in numbers for a and b to test. Let's choose a=3 and b=1. Then compute each part.\n\nOriginal equation: (a\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(a + b)^2 * X = (a - b)^2.\n\nPlugging in a=3, b=1:\n\nLeft side numerator: 3\u00b2 -1\u00b2 =9-1=8. Denominator (3+1)^2=16. So (8/16)*X = (2)^2 =4.\n\nSo (0.5)*X =4 \u2192 X=8.\n\nNow, what's (a + b)(a - b) when a=3 and b=1? (4)(2)=8. So that's exactly the value of X here. So that matches option A. \n\nAnother test case. Let a=2, b=1.\n\nLeft side numerator: 4-1=3, denominator (3)^2=9. So 3/9 = 1/3. Then the right side is (1)^2 =1. So (1/3)*X =1 \u2192 X=3.\n\nNow (a + b)(a - b) is 3*1=3. Which matches. So that works. \n\nSo the answer is A. Let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)(a + b)(a - b)\n\nB)(a - b)^2\n\nC)(a + b)^2\n\nD)a^3 + b^3\n\nE)None of these\n\nYes, so A is correct. Therefore the answer should be A.\n\n\nTo solve for the question mark (?) in the equation \\(\\frac{a^2 - b^2}{(a + b)^2} \\times ? = (a - b)^2\\), we denote the missing term as \\(X\\). Rearranging the equation to solve for \\(X\\):\n\n\\[\nX = \\frac{(a - b)^2 \\times (a + b)^2}{a^2 - b^2}\n\\]\n\nRecognizing that \\(a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)\\), substitute this into the equation:\n\n\\[\nX = \\frac{(a - b)^2 \\times (a + b)^2}{(a + b)(a - b)}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying by canceling common factors in the numerator and denominator:\n\n\\[\nX = (a + b)(a - b)\n\\]\n\nTesting with numerical values (e.g., \\(a = 3\\), \\(b = 1\\)) confirms this result. The correct option is **A**.\n\nAnswer: A",
