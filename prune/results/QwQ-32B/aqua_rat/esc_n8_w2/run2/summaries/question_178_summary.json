      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about ages. Hmm, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. And we need to find Ajay's current age given that Sachin will be 40 in 10 years. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's parse the information. The key here is to set up the equations correctly. Let me assign variables. Let me think: Let's let Ajay's current age be A, and Sachin's current age be S.\n\nThe problem says, \"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back.\" Ten years back, so that's 10 years ago. So, Sachin's age then would be S - 10, and Ajay's age then would be A - 10. The statement says that at that time, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay. So the equation would be:\n\nS - 10 = 2*(A - 10)\n\nGot that. Then the second part of the question says, \"Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.\" So in 10 years, Sachin's age will be S + 10 = 40. Wait, that's straightforward. So from that, we can find S first.\n\nLet me solve that part first. If in 10 years, Sachin is 40, then his current age S is 40 -10 = 30. Wait, that makes sense. So S = 30.\n\nNow that we know S is 30, we can plug that back into the first equation. Let's do that.\n\nOriginal equation from 10 years ago: S -10 = 2*(A -10)\n\nSubstituting S=30: 30 -10 = 2*(A -10)\n\nSo that simplifies to 20 = 2*(A -10). Divide both sides by 2: 10 = A -10. Then adding 10 to both sides: A = 20.\n\nSo Ajay's current age would be 20? Let me check the options. Option D is 20. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes these problems can be tricky.\n\nWait, let me verify. If Ajay is 20 now, then 10 years ago he was 10. Then Sachin was twice that, so 20. But Sachin's current age is 30, so 10 years ago he was 20. Yes, that matches. Then in 10 years, Sachin will be 40. That all adds up.\n\nSo the answer should be D)20. Let me check the options again. The options are A)18, B)25, C)15, D)20, E)21. Yep, D is there. \n\nHmm, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the equations. Let me think again. The problem says \"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back.\" So 10 years back, Sachin's age then was twice Ajay's age then. The equations seem right. And solving gives A=20, which is D. So I think that's correct. The answer is D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote Sachin's current age as \\( S \\) and Ajay's current age as \\( A \\).\n\n1. **Interpret the given information:**\n   - **Ten years ago**, Sachin was twice as old as Ajay.

Let me read it again. \n\nThe problem says: \"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back. How old is Ajay today if Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years?\" The options are A to E. \n\nAlright, first, I need to set up the equations based on the information given. Let's denote their current ages. Let me think... Let me assign variables. Let's say Ajay's current age is A, and Sachin's current age is S. \n\nThe first part says, \"Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back.\" Ten years back means we subtract 10 from both of their current ages. So, 10 years ago, Sachin's age was S - 10 and Ajay's was A - 10. The statement says Sachin was twice as old as Ajay then. So the equation would be:\n\nS - 10 = 2*(A - 10)\n\nGot that. Now the second part: \"Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years.\" So in 10 years, Sachin's age will be S + 10 = 40. Wait, so from his current age, adding 10 gives 40. So solving that, S +10 =40 \u2192 S=30. So Sachin is currently 30 years old. \n\nNow that we know S is 30, we can plug that back into the first equation.

So the answer is D. \n\nWait, but I should make sure there's no other interpretation. Like, maybe \"Sachin will be 40 in 10 years\" \u2014 that's straightforward. So current age of Sachin is 30. Then, 10 years ago, he was 20, which is twice Ajay's age then (10). So Ajay is 20 now. That all lines up. \n\nHmm, I think that's right. So the answer should be D)20.\n",
