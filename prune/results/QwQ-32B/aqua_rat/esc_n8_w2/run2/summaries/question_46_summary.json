      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so the problem here is about calculating the population of a city after two years with an annual increase of 5%. The current population is 78,000. Hmm, right, I remember that population growth can be calculated using the formula for compound interest because it's increasing by a percentage each year. Let me think... The formula is something like P = P0*(1 + r)^t, where P0 is the initial amount, r is the rate, and t is time.\n\nWait, yeah, that's right. Since it's increasing each year, each year's population is based on the previous year's. So for two years, we have to apply the 5% increase twice. Let me break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, the initial population is 78,000. After the first year, it would increase by 5%. To calculate that, 5% of 78,000 is... let's see, 5% is 0.05. So 78,000 multiplied by 0.05 equals 3,900. Adding that to the original population gives 78,000 + 3,900 = 81,900. That's the population after the first year. \n\nNow, the second year's increase would be 5% of 81,900. Let me compute that. 81,900 * 0.05. Hmm, 80,000 * 0.05 is 4,000, and 1,900 * 0.05 is 95. So total is 4,000 + 95 = 4,095. Adding that to 81,900 gives 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995. \n\nWait, but looking at the options, option B is 85,995 and option C is 85,800. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation error. Let me check again. Alternatively, maybe using the formula directly would be better. \n\nThe formula for two years would be 78,000*(1.05)^2. Let me compute (1.05)^2 first. 1.05 squared is 1.1025. So 78,000 multiplied by 1.1025. Let's do that step by step. \n\nFirst, 78,000 * 1.1 is 85,800. Then, the remaining 0.0025. Wait, 1.1025 is 1.1 + 0.0025. Alternatively, maybe breaking down 1.1025 as 1 + 0.1 + 0.0025? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe calculate 78,000 * 1.1025 directly. \n\nAlternatively, 78,000 * 1.1025 can be calculated as 78,000 * (1 + 0.1 + 0.0025). Wait, perhaps better to do 78,000 * 1.1025. Let me compute 78,000 * 1.1 first, which is 85,800. Then, 78,000 * 0.0025 is 78,000 * 0.0025. 0.0025 is a quarter of a percent. So 1% of 78,000 is 780, so 0.25% is 195. Therefore adding 195 to the 85,800 gives 85,995. Oh right, that matches the first calculation. \n\nSo according to this, the population after two years is 85,995. Looking at the options, that's option B. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A)81900, which is after one year. B is 85995, which is what I calculated. C is 85800 which is the 1.1 times, but without the extra 0.0025 part. So maybe someone might miscalculate by doing simple interest? Let's see.\n\nIf someone does simple interest, which would be 5% each year, so total 10%, then 78000 * 1.10 = 85,800. That's option C. But the question says annual increase, so it's compound, right? Because population growth is typically compounded. So the correct answer should be B. But let me check again my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me recalculate the second year's increase again. \n\nFirst year: 78,000 *1.05 = 81,900. Second year: 81,900 *1.05. Let's compute that again. 81,900 * 1.05. Breaking down: 81,900 + 5% of 81,900. 5% of 80,000 is 4,000, and 5% of 1,900 is 95, so total 4,095. So adding to 81,900 gives 81,900 + 4,095 = 85,995. Yep, that's correct. So the answer must be B. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 85995, so that's correct. So the answer is B. Wait but why is option C there? Maybe a common mistake. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent? Let me check the formula again. The formula is initial * (1 + rate)^number of periods. So 78000*(1.05)^2. Which is exactly what I did. So yes, B is correct. The options include B as an option, so the answer is B. But the options also include E) None of these. Wait, but since B is correct, E is not needed. So the answer must be B. Therefore, the correct choice is B.\n",
