      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about the number of factors a positive integer Q has. Specifically, if Q has exactly 5 factors, which of the statements I, II, or III must be true. The options are given, so I need to figure out which of the statements are necessarily correct.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors of a number relates to its prime factorization. The formula for the number of divisors is that if a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p\u2081^a * p\u2082^b * ... then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. So for example, if Q is a square of a prime, like p\u00b2, then its factors are 1, p, p\u00b2, so that's 3 factors. Wait, but the question says 5 factors. Hmm.\n\nWait, 5 is a prime number itself. So the product of exponents plus one must equal 5. Since 5 is prime, the only way to get that product is 5 = 5*1. So that means the number must be of the form p^4, where p is a prime. Because (4 +1) =5. Alternatively, could there be another way? Like if it's a product of two different primes with exponents such that (a+1)(b+1)=5. But since 5 is prime, the only factors are 5 and 1, so that would require one of the terms to be 5 and the other 1. So the exponents would have to be 4 and 0, but since exponents can't be zero (as that would mean the prime isn't part of the factorization), so the only possibility is that it's a single prime raised to the 4th power. \n\nWait a second, so that would mean that Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So statement II says exactly that. But what about statement I? Statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, if Q is p^4, then that's (p\u00b2) squared, which is a square of p squared, but p squared is not necessarily prime. For example, if p is 2, then p^4 is 16, which is 4 squared. But 4 isn't a prime. So statement I would not be true. Wait, so statement I says \"the square of a prime number\", but in this case, the base is p^2, which is composite unless p is 2? Wait no, p is a prime, so p squared is composite except when p is 2? Wait, no, any prime squared is composite. So the square of a prime would be like (prime)^2, which would have 3 factors, but in this case Q is (prime)^4, which is (prime squared)^2. So the square of a composite number, but that's not a prime. So statement I is not necessarily true. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says \"must be true\". So if Q has exactly five factors, then Q must be a fourth power of a prime. Therefore, statement II must be true. But then statement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, if Q is p^4, then it is the square of p squared, but p squared isn't a prime. So I is not necessarily true. So statement II must be true. So then option C is the answer? Wait but let me check the other statements.\n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two prime numbers. Let's see. If Q is p^4, then its prime factors are only p. So the product of two primes would require two different primes, but in this case, it's only one prime. So the product of two primes would be like p*q, which would have (1+1)(1+1) =4 factors. So that would be 4 factors, not 5. Therefore, Q can't be the product of two primes. So statement III is not true. So only statement II must be true, so the answer is C. But wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, wait a second. Let me check again. Let me think of examples. Let's take Q as 16, which is 2^4. Its factors are 1,2,4,8,16. That's five factors. So that's correct. So 16 is the fourth power of 2 (prime), so II is true here. But 16 is not the square of a prime number, because the square of a prime would be like 3^2 =9, which has 3 factors. So 16 is a square of 4, which is composite. So statement I is false here. So I is not necessarily true. \n\nAnother example: take 81, which is 3^4. Same thing. Its factors are 1,3,9,27,81. Five factors. Again, that's a fourth power of prime, so II holds, but it's not the square of a prime. So I is false here. So II must be true, but I is not. \n\nWhat about statement III? The product of two primes. Let's see: suppose Q is the product of two primes, say 2*3=6. The factors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. That's four factors. So that's not five. If the two primes are the same, like 2*2=4, but that's a square, which has three factors. So even if the product is of two same primes, that's a square and has three factors, not five. So the only way to get five factors is the fourth power of a prime. Therefore, III is not true. So the correct answer must be C) II only. \n\nWait, but hold on, the options given include D) I and II only and E) I and III only. Wait, but according to my analysis, only II is correct. So the answer is C. But let me check if there's any other scenario where a number has five factors. \n\nWait, another thought: perhaps if the number is the product of a prime cubed and another prime? Let me see. Suppose Q = p^3 * q^1. Then the number of factors is (3+1)(1+1) = 4*2=8. Not five. So that's too many. Alternatively, if the number is p^4, which gives five factors, as before. \n\nAlternatively, if the number is p^2 * q^2, then factors would be (2+1)(2+1)=9, which is more. So the only way to get exactly five factors is when the number is a single prime raised to the 4th power. Therefore, statement II must be true, and I and III are not. Therefore the correct option is C. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in considering statement I. Let me think again. The first statement says Q is the square of a prime. Wait, but if Q is p^4, then it is indeed the square of p squared. But p squared is not a prime unless p is... Wait, primes are numbers greater than 1. So p squared would be like 2 squared is 4, which is composite. So the square of a prime number would be (prime)^2, which is p squared, but then that would have three factors. So Q is p^4, which is (p squared)^2, but that's a square of a composite number, not a prime. Therefore statement I is not true. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be option C. So the correct choice is C) II only. So the answer is C.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, or III must be true if Q is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors. Hmm, let me start by recalling how the number of factors works.\n\nI remember that the number of factors of a number is determined by its prime factorization. If a number Q can be expressed as the product of primes raised to exponents, like Q = p\u2081^a \u00d7 p\u2082^b \u00d7 ... then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. Right?\n\nThe question says Q has exactly 5 factors. Let's think about what exponents would lead to that. Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to get 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. So, the formula for the number of factors must be (a+1) =5, meaning that the exponent a is 4. Wait, but wait, maybe there's another way? Like if there were two primes, but their exponents plus one multiply to 5. But since 5 is prime, the only factors are 1 and 5. So the only way is (5) or (1 \u00d75). \n\nWait, so if the number has only one prime factor, then its exponent plus one must be 5. So the exponent would be 4. So that would mean Q is p^4, where p is a prime. Alternatively, if there were two primes, then (a+1)(b+1) would have to equal 5, but since 5 is prime, one of them would have to be 5 and the other 1. But that would require two primes, but then one exponent would be 4 and the other 0? Wait, no, exponents can't be zero because then that prime wouldn't be part of the factorization. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the prime factorization can't have more than one prime, because if there are two primes, then the exponents would have to be such that (a+1)(b+1) =5. But since 5 is prime, one of them must be 5 and the other 1. But the exponents a and b have to be at least 1, right? Wait, no, exponents can be zero. Wait, but if a prime is present in the factorization, its exponent is at least 1. Wait, the exponents for primes in the factorization are at least 1. So if there are two primes, then (a+1)(b+1) must equal 5. Since both a and b are at least 1, then (a+1) and (b+1) would each be at least 2. But 2 \u00d72 is already 4, which is less than 5, but 5 can't be divided into two numbers each at least 2 except 5\u00d71, but 1 would require an exponent of 0, which means that prime isn't actually part of the factorization. So that's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that there is exactly one prime factor, and its exponent is 4. So Q must be p^4, where p is a prime. \n\nWait, but wait, hold on. Let me check. Let me think of examples. Let's say p is 2. Then 2^4 is 16. How many factors does 16 have? 1,2,4,8,16. That's 5 factors. Okay, that's correct. So if Q is p^4, then it has 5 factors. \n\nAlternatively, what if Q is the square of a prime? Like p squared. Then the number of factors would be (2+1)=3. Like 3^2 is 9, factors are 1,3,9. So three factors. So that's not 5. Wait, so that would mean that statement I says Q is the square of a prime, but in that case, the number of factors would be 3, not 5. So statement I would not be true? Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the question says \"must be true about Q\". But according to the earlier reasoning, Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So then, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. That would not be true. Wait, but that contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, so perhaps I messed up?\n\nWait, wait, let me re-express the problem. Let me see again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again. The number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. So if Q has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is prime, then the only way is that the product of (exponents +1) is 5. Since 5 is prime, that product must be 5 itself, so there's only one term. Therefore, the exponent plus one is 5, so exponent is 4. Therefore, Q must be the fourth power of a prime. Therefore, statement II says \"Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\" So statement II must be true. But the options include II only (option C), but let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA)I only\n\nB)III only\n\nC)II only\n\nD)I and II only\n\nE)I and III only\n\nWait, but the problem is, what about the statements?\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime number. But according to our analysis, Q is p^4, which is (p\u00b2) squared. Wait, but p^4 is the square of p squared. So, if p is a prime, then p\u00b2 is not a prime, but a composite number. So Q would not be the square of a prime. Because the square of a prime would be p^2, which has 3 factors, not 5. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true. So statement I is false.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. That's exactly what we concluded. So II must be true. \n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. Let's see. The product of two primes (like p*q) would have (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. For example, 6=2\u00d73 has factors 1,2,3,6. So four factors, but Q has five. Therefore, if Q is the product of two primes, it would have four factors, which is not the case. Alternatively, if the product is of two same primes, like p^2, then it's three factors. So the product of two primes (either distinct or same) can't give five factors. So statement III is also false. \n\nWait, but maybe the product of two primes where one is raised to a power? Wait, but the product of two primes would be p^1 * q^1, so (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. So that's four. So statement III would be incorrect. \n\nSo then the only correct statement is II. So the answer would be option C) II only. \n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"must be true about Q\". Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe there's a case where Q isn't the fourth power of a prime but still has five factors? Suppose Q is a product of two different primes each raised to some exponents. Let me see. Let's suppose Q is p^4, which gives (4+1)=5 factors. Alternatively, is there another form? For example, if Q is p^2 * q^2, then the number of factors would be (2+1)(2+1)=9. So no. What if Q is p^4*q^0, which is just p^4, so that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, if there are three primes, like p*q*r, then (1+1)^3=8 factors. So that's more than five. \n\nHmm, so the only way to get five factors is to have a single prime raised to the fourth power. Therefore, statement II must be true. \n\nSo then the correct answer is C, which is option C. \n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option C is \"II only\". \n\nSo that's the conclusion. Let me check the statements again. \n\nStatement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, if Q is p^4, then it is (p\u00b2) squared. But p squared is not a prime, it's a composite. So the square of a prime would be (prime)^2, which would have 3 factors. Therefore, statement I is not true. \n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. The product could be in the sense of primes multiplied, but if Q is p^4, then it's only one prime factor. So the product of two primes would require two different primes, but that gives four factors. So III is not true. \n\nTherefore, only II must be true. So the answer is C.\n",

So if there are two primes, then (a+1)(b+1) must equal 5. Since both a and b are at least 1, then (a+1) and (b+1) would each be at least 2. But 2 \u00d72 is already 4, which is less than 5, but 5 can't be divided into two numbers each at least 2 except 5\u00d71, but 1 would require an exponent of 0, which means that prime isn't actually part of the factorization. So that's not possible. \n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that there is exactly one prime factor, and its exponent is 4. So Q must be p^4, where p is a prime. \n\nWait, but wait, hold on. Let me check. Let me think of examples. Let's say p is 2. Then 2^4 is 16. How many factors does 16 have? 1,2,4,8,16. That's 5 factors. Okay, that's correct. So if Q is p^4, then it has 5 factors. \n\nAlternatively, what if Q is the square of a prime? Like p squared. Then the number of factors would be (2+1)=3. Like 3^2 is 9, factors are 1,3,9. So three factors. So that's not 5. Wait, so that would mean that statement I says Q is the square of a prime, but in that case, the number of factors would be 3, not 5. So statement I would not be true? Wait, but wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Wait, the question says \"must be true about Q\". But according to the earlier reasoning, Q must be the fourth power of a prime. So then, statement I says Q is the square of a prime. That would not be true. Wait, but that contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, so perhaps I messed up?\n\nWait, wait, let me re-express the problem. Let me see again.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Let me think again. The number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)... etc. So if Q has exactly 5 factors, and 5 is prime, then the only way is that the product of (exponents +1) is 5. Since 5 is prime, that product must be 5 itself, so there's only one term. Therefore, the exponent plus one is 5, so exponent is 4. Therefore, Q must be the fourth power of a prime. Therefore, statement II says \"Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\" So statement II must be true. But the options include II only (option C), but let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA)I only\n\nB)III only\n\nC)II only\n\nD)I and II only\n\nE)I and III only\n\nWait, but the problem is, what about the statements?\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime number. But according to our analysis, Q is p^4, which is (p\u00b2) squared. Wait, but p^4 is the square of p squared. So, if p is a prime, then p\u00b2 is not a prime, but a composite number. So Q would not be the square of a prime. Because the square of a prime would be p^2, which has 3 factors, not 5. Therefore, statement I is not necessarily true. So statement I is false.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. That's exactly what we concluded. So II must be true. \n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. Let's see. The product of two primes (like p*q) would have (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. For example, 6=2\u00d73 has factors 1,2,3,6. So four factors, but Q has five. Therefore, if Q is the product of two primes, it would have four factors, which is not the case. Alternatively, if the product is of two same primes, like p^2, then it's three factors. So the product of two primes (either distinct or same) can't give five factors. So statement III is also false. \n\nWait, but maybe the product of two primes where one is raised to a power? Wait, but the product of two primes would be p^1 * q^1, so (1+1)(1+1)=4 factors. So that's four. So statement III would be incorrect. \n\nSo then the only correct statement is II. So the answer would be option C) II only. \n\nWait, but wait, the problem says \"must be true about Q\". Let me think again. \n\nWait, maybe there's a case where Q isn't the fourth power of a prime but still has five factors? Suppose Q is a product of two different primes each raised to some exponents. Let me see. Let's suppose Q is p^4, which gives (4+1)=5 factors. Alternatively, is there another form? For example, if Q is p^2 * q^2, then the number of factors would be (2+1)(2+1)=9. So no. What if Q is p^4*q^0, which is just p^4, so that's the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, if there are three primes, like p*q*r, then (1+1)^3=8 factors. So that's more than five. \n\nHmm, so the only way to get five factors is to have a single prime raised to the fourth power. Therefore, statement II must be true. \n\nSo then the correct answer is C, which is option C. \n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option C is \"II only\". \n\nSo that's the conclusion. Let me check the statements again. \n\nStatement I says Q is the square of a prime. Well, if Q is p^4, then it is (p\u00b2) squared. But p squared is not a prime, it's a composite. So the square of a prime would be (prime)^2, which would have 3 factors. Therefore, statement I is not true. \n\nStatement III says Q is the product of two primes. The product could be in the sense of primes multiplied, but if Q is p^4, then it's only one prime factor. So the product of two primes would require two different primes, but that gives four factors. So III is not true. \n\nTherefore, only II must be true. So the answer is C.\n\n\nTo determine which statements must be true about Q, a positive integer with exactly 5 factors, we analyze the relationship between prime factorization and the number of factors. The number of factors of a number \\( Q = p_1^{a} \\times p_2^{b} \\times \\ldots \\) is given by \\((a+1)(b+1)\\ldots\\). Since 5 is a prime number, the only way to express it as a product of integers greater than 1 is \\(5 = 5 \\times 1\\). This implies \\( Q \\) must be of the form \\( p^4 \\) where \\( p \\) is a prime (since \\( (4+1) = 5 \\)). \n\n- **Statement I**: \"Q is the square of a prime number.\"  \n  A prime squared (\\( p^2 \\)) has \\( (2+1) = 3 \\) factors, not 5. Since \\( Q = p^4 \\), it is the square of \\( p^2 \\), but \\( p^2 \\) is not a prime. Thus, **I is false**.\n\n- **Statement II**: \"Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\"  \n  This directly matches our analysis, as \\( Q = p^4 \\). **II is true**.\n\n- **Statement III**: \"Q is the product of two prime numbers.\"  \n  The product of two primes (distinct or the same) results in \\( (1+1)(1+1) = 4 \\) factors or \\( (2+1) = 3 \\) factors, neither of which equals 5. **III is false**.\n\nThus, only **II must be true**.\n\nAnswer: C",
