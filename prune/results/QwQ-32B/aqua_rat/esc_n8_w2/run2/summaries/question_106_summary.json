      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is about Mark and John and their money. Hmm, I need to figure out how much John had originally. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, the question says Mark told John, \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" Then John replied, \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" We have to find out how much John had initially. The options are given, so maybe plugging in the options could help, but I think setting up equations is better.\n\nLet me assign variables. Let me denote Mark's current money as M and John's as J. Then, let's parse the first statement.\n\nMark's statement: If John gives him half his money, then Mark's total becomes M + (J/2) = 75. So equation one is M + (J/2) = 75.\n\nJohn's statement: If Mark gives him one third of his money, then John's total becomes J + (M/3) = 75. So equation two is J + (M/3) = 75.\n\nNow I have two equations with two variables. Let me write them again:\n\n1. M + (J/2) = 75\n2. J + (M/3) = 75\n\nI need to solve these two equations for M and J. Let's see. Maybe substitution?\n\nFrom equation 1, I can express M in terms of J. Let's do that first.\n\nFrom equation 1: M = 75 - (J/2)\n\nNow plug this M into equation 2:\n\nJ + [ (75 - (J/2)) / 3 ] = 75\n\nHmm, let's compute that step by step. Let me write it out:\n\nJ + (1/3)(75 - (J/2)) = 75\n\nLet me distribute the 1/3:\n\nJ + (75/3) - (J)/(2*3) =75\n\nSimplify 75/3 is 25. So:\n\nJ +25 - (J/6) =75\n\nCombine like terms. Let's get all the J terms together. J minus (J/6) is (6J/6 - J/6) = 5J/6.\n\nSo 5J/6 +25 =75\n\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\n5J/6 = 75 -25 =50\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n5J = 50 *6 = 300\n\nDivide by 5:\n\nJ = 60. Wait, but 60 is option B. Let me check the options again. The options are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18. So B is 60. But wait, let me verify again because sometimes these problems can have tricks.\n\nWait, let me check with the equations again. Let me plug back J=60 into the first equation to find M.\n\nFrom equation1: M + (60/2) =75 \u2192 M +30 =75 \u2192 M=45.\n\nThen check equation2 with J=60 and M=45:\n\nJohn's money after getting 1/3 of Mark's: 60 + (45/3) =60 +15 =75. That works. So that seems correct. Hmm, but wait, the options have B as 60. But let me check the question again. The question is asking how much money did John have? So yes, that would be J, which is 60. So answer B?\n\nWait, but wait a second. Let me think again. Because sometimes in these problems, the way the money is transferred might have a different interpretation. Let me confirm the equations again.\n\nMark says, \"If you give me half your money...\" So John gives half his money to Mark. So John would be left with J/2, and Mark would have M + (J/2). The problem states that Mark would then have 75, so that's correct.\n\nJohn's statement: \"If you give me one third of your money...\" So Mark gives John one third of Mark's money. So Mark gives (M/3) to John. Then John's total becomes J + (M/3), which equals 75. That's correct. So equations are right.\n\nSo solving gives J=60. So the answer should be B)60.\n\nWait but wait, the options include 22, 28, etc. Let me see if I made a miscalculation. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nStarting with the equations:\n\nEquation 1: M + (J/2) =75 \u2192 M =75 - J/2.\n\nEquation 2: J + (M/3) =75.\n\nSubstituting M from equation1 into equation2:\n\nJ + [ (75 - J/2)/3 ] =75.\n\nLet me compute the term inside: (75 - J/2)/3 = 75/3 - (J/2)/3 =25 - J/(6).\n\nSo equation becomes J +25 - J/6 =75.\n\nCombine the J terms: J - J/6 = (6J - J)/6 =5J/6. So 5J/6 +25=75.\n\nSubtract 25: 5J/6 =50 \u2192 5J =300 \u2192 J=60. Yep, that's correct.\n\nHmm, so that's correct. Then the answer is B)60. So why are the other options there? Maybe I misread the problem? Let me check again.\n\nWait the problem says \"John said, 'if you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75/-'.\" So that's exactly what I used. So the equations are correct. So the answer must be B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me see:\n\nAnother approach: Let me try plugging the answer options into the equations.\n\nSuppose option B is 60. Then John has 60. Then according to equation1, Mark has 75 - (60/2) =75-30=45. Then check John's equation: if Mark gives him a third of his money (45/3=15), so John would have 60+15=75. That works. So B is correct.\n\nAnother option, let's try option E)18. Let's see: John has 18. Then equation1: M +9 =75 \u2192 M=66. Then John's equation: 18 + (66/3)=18+22=40, which is not 75. So that's wrong.\n\nOption D:26. John has 26. Then equation1: M +13=75 \u2192 M=62. Then John's equation:26 + (62/3)= 26 +20.666... \u224846.666, which is not 75.\n\nOption A:22. Then equation1: M +11=75 \u2192 M=64. Then John's equation:22 + (64/3)=22+21.333\u224843.333, nope.\n\nOption C:28. John's money 28. Then equation1: M +14=75 \u2192 M=61. Then John's equation:28 +61/3=28 +20.333\u224848.333, not 75. So none of those work except B.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B)60.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. So the problem is between Mark and John, and there's some money involved. The question is asking how much money John originally had. Hmm, the options are given, so maybe I can set up equations based on their statements. \n\nFirst, let me parse the problem again. Mark tells John: \"If you give me half your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So that's a conditional statement. Then John responds with his own condition: \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have Rs.75.\" So each of them is talking about a hypothetical situation where they exchange some money, leading to one of them having 75. \n\nI need to find the original amounts each has. Let me denote variables. Let me call John's original money J and Mark's original money M. Then, I can translate their statements into equations.\n\nStarting with Mark's first statement. If John gives him half his money, then John would give (1/2)J, so Mark would have his original M plus that amount, and that total would be 75. So equation one would be:\n\nM + (1/2)J = 75.\n\nThen, John's statement: if Mark gives him one third of his (Mark's) money, then John's money would be his original J plus (1/3)M, and that equals 75. So equation two is:\n\nJ + (1/3)M = 75.\n\nSo now I have two equations with two variables. Let me write them down again:\n\n1) M + (J/2) = 75\n2) J + (M/3) = 75\n\nNow I need to solve these equations. Let me try substitution or elimination. Maybe substitution would work here. Let me see. Let's rearrange the first equation to express M in terms of J, then substitute into the second equation.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nM = 75 - (J/2)\n\nThen plug that into equation 2:\n\nJ + ( (75 - (J/2) ) / 3 ) = 75\n\nHmm, okay, let me compute that step by step. Let me write that equation again:\n\nJ + [ (75 - (J/2) ) / 3 ] = 75.\n\nLet me simplify the terms. Let's first compute the term inside the brackets. Let me write the entire equation again:\n\nJ + ( (75 - (J/2)) / 3 ) = 75.\n\nLet me combine the terms. To make this easier, perhaps multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate the denominator. Let me do that.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n3*J + (75 - (J/2)) = 3*75.\n\nSo 3J +75 - (J/2) = 225.\n\nNow combine like terms. Let me first compute the terms with J. 3J minus (J/2) is equal to (6J/2 - J/2) = 5J/2. So:\n\n5J/2 + 75 = 225.\n\nSubtract 75 from both sides:\n\n5J/2 = 225 -75 = 150.\n\nSo 5J/2 = 150 \u2192 Multiply both sides by 2: 5J = 300 \u2192 J = 300/5 = 60. Wait, so John has 60?\n\nWait, but let me check this. If J is 60, then from equation 1, M would be 75 - (60/2) = 75 -30 = 45. So Mark has 45.\n\nNow let's check the second equation. John's equation: J + (M/3) = 60 + (45/3) = 60 +15 =75. That works. And Mark's first statement: If John gives him half his money (half of 60 is 30), then Mark would have 45+30=75. That also checks out.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18. So 60 is option B. But I need to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through again.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) =75 \u2192 M =75 - (J/2)\n\n2. J + (M/3)=75.\n\nSubstituting M from first into the second equation:\n\nJ + ( (75 - J/2)/3 ) =75.\n\nMultiply all terms by 3:\n\n3J +75 - (J/2) =225 \u2192 3J - (J/2) = 225-75 \u2192 ( (6J/2 - J/2 ) ) = 150 \u2192 5J/2 =150 \u2192 J= (150 *2)/5 \u2192 300/5 =60. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo John has 60, which is option B. But wait, the problem is in the options given, B is 60, so that's the answer. Hmm, but let me check the options again to make sure. The problem says \"how much money did John have?\" So yes, the answer should be B)60. \n\nWait, but I feel like sometimes in these problems there might be a trick. Let me think again. Maybe I misread the statements. Let me check the problem again.\n\nMark's statement: \"If you give me half your money, I will have 75.\" So John gives half his money to Mark. So John's original money is J, so he gives J/2. Then Mark's total becomes M + J/2 =75. That's correct.\n\nJohn's statement: \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have 75.\" So Mark gives John (1/3) of his own money. So Mark gives (1/3)M to John. So John's total is J + (1/3)M =75. That's right. \n\nSo equations are correct. The solution comes out to J=60. So the answer should be B. But let me check if any of the other options could work. Let's try plugging in another option, like E)18. Let's see if that works. Suppose John had 18.\n\nThen from equation 1, M would be 75 -9 =66. Then in equation 2, J + (M/3)=18 +22=40, which is not 75. So that's not.\n\nHow about option D)26? Let's see. J=26. Then M would be 75 -13 =62. Then equation 2: 26 + (62/3) = 26 + ~20.666 = ~46.666, nope.\n\nOption C)28: J=28, so M =75-14=61. Then equation 2:28 +61/3 \u224828+20.333\u224848.333. Not 75. \n\nOption A)22: J=22, so M=75-11=64. Then equation 2:22 + (64/3)=22+21.333\u224843.333. Nope.\n\nSo yes, only when J=60 does it work. So the correct answer is B)60. So I think that's correct.\n",

If John gives him half his money, then John would give (1/2)J, so Mark would have his original M plus that amount, and that total would be 75. So equation one would be:\n\nM + (1/2)J = 75.\n\nThen, John's statement: if Mark gives him one third of his (Mark's) money, then John's money would be his original J plus (1/3)M, and that equals 75. So equation two is:\n\nJ + (1/3)M = 75.\n\nSo now I have two equations with two variables. Let me write them down again:\n\n1) M + (J/2) = 75\n2) J + (M/3) = 75\n\nNow I need to solve these equations. Let me try substitution or elimination. Maybe substitution would work here. Let me see. Let's rearrange the first equation to express M in terms of J, then substitute into the second equation.\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nM = 75 - (J/2)\n\nThen plug that into equation 2:\n\nJ + ( (75 - (J/2) ) / 3 ) = 75\n\nHmm, okay, let me compute that step by step. Let me write that equation again:\n\nJ + [ (75 - (J/2) ) / 3 ] = 75.\n\nLet me simplify the terms. Let's first compute the term inside the brackets. Let me write the entire equation again:\n\nJ + ( (75 - (J/2)) / 3 ) = 75.\n\nLet me combine the terms. To make this easier, perhaps multiply all terms by 3 to eliminate the denominator. Let me do that.\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n3*J + (75 - (J/2)) = 3*75.\n\nSo 3J +75 - (J/2) = 225.\n\nNow combine like terms. Let me first compute the terms with J. 3J minus (J/2) is equal to (6J/2 - J/2) = 5J/2. So:\n\n5J/2 + 75 = 225.\n\nSubtract 75 from both sides:\n\n5J/2 = 225 -75 = 150.\n\nSo 5J/2 = 150 \u2192 Multiply both sides by 2: 5J = 300 \u2192 J = 300/5 = 60. Wait, so John has 60?\n\nWait, but let me check this. If J is 60, then from equation 1, M would be 75 - (60/2) = 75 -30 = 45. So Mark has 45.\n\nNow let's check the second equation. John's equation: J + (M/3) = 60 + (45/3) = 60 +15 =75. That works. And Mark's first statement: If John gives him half his money (half of 60 is 30), then Mark would have 45+30=75. That also checks out.\n\nWait, but the options given are A)22, B)60, C)28, D)26, E)18. So 60 is option B. But I need to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me go through again.\n\nOriginal equations:\n\n1. M + (J/2) =75 \u2192 M =75 - (J/2)\n\n2. J + (M/3)=75.\n\nSubstituting M from first into the second equation:\n\nJ + ( (75 - J/2)/3 ) =75.\n\nMultiply all terms by 3:\n\n3J +75 - (J/2) =225 \u2192 3J - (J/2) = 225-75 \u2192 ( (6J/2 - J/2 ) ) = 150 \u2192 5J/2 =150 \u2192 J= (150 *2)/5 \u2192 300/5 =60. Yep, that's correct.\n\nSo John has 60, which is option B. But wait, the problem is in the options given, B is 60, so that's the answer. Hmm, but let me check the options again to make sure. The problem says \"how much money did John have?\" So yes, the answer should be B)60. \n\nWait, but I feel like sometimes in these problems there might be a trick. Let me think again. Maybe I misread the statements. Let me check the problem again.\n\nMark's statement: \"If you give me half your money, I will have 75.\" So John gives half his money to Mark. So John's original money is J, so he gives J/2. Then Mark's total becomes M + J/2 =75. That's correct.\n\nJohn's statement: \"If you give me one third of your money, I will have 75.\" So Mark gives John (1/3) of his own money. So Mark gives (1/3)M to John. So John's total is J + (1/3)M =75. That's right. \n\nSo equations are correct. The solution comes out to J=60. So the answer should be B. But let me check if any of the other options could work. Let's try plugging in another option, like E)18. Let's see if that works. Suppose John had 18.\n\nThen from equation 1, M would be 75 -9 =66. Then in equation 2, J + (M/3)=18 +22=40, which is not 75. So that's not.\n\nHow about option D)26? Let's see. J=26. Then M would be 75 -13 =62. Then equation 2: 26 + (62/3) = 26 + ~20.666 = ~46.666, nope.\n\nOption C)28: J=28, so M =75-14=61. Then equation 2:28 +61/3 \u224828+20.333\u224848.333. Not 75. \n\nOption A)22: J=22, so M=75-11=64. Then equation 2:22 + (64/3)=22+21.333\u224843.333. Nope.\n\nSo yes, only when J=60 does it work. So the correct answer is B)60. So I think that's correct.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's denote John's original money as \\( J \\) and Mark's original money as \\( M \\). \n\n**Mark's statement**: If John gives him half his money, Mark will have Rs. 75. This translates to:\n\\[\nM + \\frac{J}{2} = 75 \\quad \\text{(1)}\n\\]\n\n**John's statement**: If Mark gives him one-third of his money, John will have Rs. 75. This translates to:\n\\[\nJ + \\frac{M}{3} = 75 \\quad \\text{(2)}\n\\]\n\nFrom equation (1), solve for \\( M \\):\n\\[\nM = 75 - \\frac{J}{2}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( M \\) into equation (2):\n\\[\nJ + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(75 - \\frac{J}{2}\\right) = 75\n\\]\n\nMultiply through by 3 to eliminate the fraction:\n\\[\n3J + 75 - \\frac{J}{2} = 225\n\\]\n\nCombine like terms:\n\\[\n\\frac{5J}{2} + 75 = 225\n\\]\n\nSubtract 75 from both sides:\n\\[\n\\frac{5J}{2} = 150\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\\[\n5J = 300 \\implies J = 60\n\\]\n\nVerify with the original equations:\n- If \\( J = 60 \\), then \\( M = 75 - \\frac{60}{2} = 45 \\).\n- Check John's equation: \\( 60 + \\frac{45}{3} = 60 + 15 = 75 \\), which holds true.\n\nThus, John originally had **Rs. 60**.\n\nAnswer: B)60.\n\nAnswer: $B",
