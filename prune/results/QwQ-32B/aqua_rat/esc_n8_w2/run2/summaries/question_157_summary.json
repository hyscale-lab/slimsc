      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about a survey where each student picked their two favorite songs from a list of 10. Each song was selected 5 times. We need to find out how many students were surveyed. Hmm, right.\n\nSo, each student chooses 2 songs. That means each student contributes 2 selections. So the total number of selections across all students would be 2 times the number of students. Let me write that down. Let the number of students be N. Then total selections = 2*N.\n\nOn the other hand, each of the 10 songs was selected 5 times. So total selections can also be calculated as 10 songs * 5 selections each = 50 total selections. \n\nWait, so setting those equal: 2*N = 10*5 =50. Then solving for N would be 50/2 =25. So N is 25. Let me check the options. Option D is 25. That seems right. \n\nBut wait, is there a possibility that the same song can't be chosen by a student more than once? The problem says \"the 2 songs that the student liked best,\" which implies they have to be different. So each student picks exactly two distinct songs, so each selection is indeed two. So the calculation holds. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be D)25.\n",

The problem says each student picked 2 songs they liked best from a list of 10. And each song was selected 5 times. Hmm.\n\nSo, first, let me think about the total number of selections. Each student chose 2 songs, so the total number of song selections is equal to 2 times the number of students. Let me write that down: total selections = 2 * students.\n\nOn the other hand, there are 10 songs, and each was selected 5 times.

The problem says \"the 2 songs that the student liked best.\" Typically, such questions assume that you can't pick the same song twice because they are your top two.
