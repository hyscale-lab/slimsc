      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to add +45 and -30. Hmm, let me think. When you add a positive and a negative number, it's like subtracting the smaller absolute value from the larger one and then taking the sign of the larger. Wait, right. The absolute value of 45 is bigger than 30. So subtract 30 from 45, which gives 15. Since 45 was positive, the result should be positive. So 45 minus 30 is 15. So the answer should be +15. Let me check the options. Option D is 15. So the answer must be D.\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem of adding +45 and -30, we first recognize that adding a positive and a negative number involves subtracting the smaller absolute value from the larger one and adopting the sign of the number with the larger absolute value. Here, the absolute values are 45 and 30. Since 45 is larger than 30, we subtract 30 from 45, resulting in 15. The sign of the result is positive because the number with the larger absolute value (+45) is positive. Therefore, the sum of +45 and -30 is +15.\n\nExamining the options, D) 15 corresponds to this result.\n\nAnswer: D",

Oh right, it's like subtracting the smaller number from the bigger one and taking the sign of the larger. Wait, which one is larger here? 45 is bigger than 30. So subtract 30 from 45, which gives 15. Since the larger number was positive, the result should be positive. So the answer must be +15. Let me check the options. The options are A)-30, B)+30, C)0, D)15, E)-15. Oh, D is 15, which is positive. So the answer is D. Wait, but sometimes I get confused with the signs. Let me do it another way. +45 plus (-30) is the same as 45 minus 30. 45-30 is definitely 15. Yeah, so D is correct. The options don't have +15 written, but D is 15, which I guess is the same as +15. So the answer should be D.\n",
