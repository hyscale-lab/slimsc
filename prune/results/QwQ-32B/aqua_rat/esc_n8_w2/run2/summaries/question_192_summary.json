      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. Hmm, so the company makes pens, and 10% are defective and rejected. They need to deliver 7200 pens. The selling price is Rs.10 each, and they want an overall profit of 25%. We need to find the manufacturing cost per pen.\n\nWait, first, since 10% are defective, they have to make more pens than 7200 to end up with 7200 good ones. Let me think. If 10% are rejected, then 90% are acceptable. So the number they need to produce is such that 90% of that number equals 7200. Let me write that down:\n\nLet x be the number of pens produced. Then 0.9x = 7200. Solving for x gives x = 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens. So they have to make 8000 pens to have 7200 good ones.\n\nNow, the company sells 7200 pens at Rs.10 each. The total revenue would be 7200 * 10 = Rs.72,000. \n\nThe problem says the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. Wait, profit is calculated on the cost, right? So the profit is 25% of the total cost. Let me recall the formula: Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price. And Profit Percentage is (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. \n\nThe question says the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. So maybe the total selling revenue is 125% of the total cost. Because if profit is 25%, then Selling Price is Cost + 25% of Cost = 125% of Cost. \n\nSo total revenue (Rs.72,000) is equal to 125% of the total cost. Let me write that as an equation. Let C be total cost. Then 1.25C = 72,000. So solving for C gives C = 72,000 / 1.25. Let me compute that. 72000 divided by 1.25. 72000 divided by 5 is 14,400, so times 4 (since 1.25 is 5/4, so dividing by 5/4 is multiplying by 4/5). Wait, 72,000 * 4 = 288,000, divided by 5 is 57,600. So total cost is Rs.57,600. \n\nTherefore, the total manufacturing cost for 8000 pens is 57,600. So per pen cost would be 57,600 divided by 8000. Let me calculate that. 57,600 divided by 8000. Let's see, 8000 goes into 57,600 how many times? 8000 *7 is 56,000. Subtract that from 57,600 gives 1,600. Then 8000 goes into 1,600 0.2 times (since 8000 *0.2 is 1600). So total is 7.2. So per pen cost is Rs.7.2. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 7.2. Wait, but let me check again. Did I make any mistake here?\n\nWait, hold on. The problem says \"the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". Hmm, perhaps I need to confirm the interpretation. The profit is 25% on the cost. So the selling price (revenue) is cost plus 25% of cost, so yes, 125% of cost. So that part seems right. \n\nTotal revenue is 7200*10=72,000. That's correct. The total cost is 57,600. So per pen cost is 57600 /8000. Let me do that division again. 8000 x7 = 56,000. 57,600-56,000 is 1,600. 1600/8000 = 0.2. So total per pen cost is 7.2. So the answer should be B. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is considering the profit per pen? Wait, no, the problem says \"overall profit on all the manufactured pens\". So total profit is 25% of total cost. So the calculation seems correct. \n\nHmm. Let me think again. Suppose the cost per pen is 7.2, then total cost for 8000 pens is 8000 *7.2 =57,600. The revenue is 72,000. Profit is 72,000-57,600=14,400. Then 14,400 /57,600 is 0.25, which is 25%. So that checks out. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be B) Rs.7.2.\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a pen company. Let me read it again carefully. The company produces pens, and 10% of them are defective and get rejected before packing. They need to deliver 7200 pens to a wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. The overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. I need to find the manufacturing cost per pen. The options are given, but I have to figure out the correct one.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. First, the company wants to deliver 7200 good pens. But since 10% are defective, they must make more than 7200. Because out of the total produced, 10% are rejected, so 90% are acceptable. So the total number of pens they need to manufacture is such that 90% of that total equals 7200. Let me write that equation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the total number of pens manufactured as T. Then 90% of T is 7200. So 0.9*T = 7200. Therefore, T = 7200 / 0.9 = 8000 pens. Right, so they have to make 8000 pens in total to end up with 7200 good ones after rejecting 10%.\n\nNow, the company sells these 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each. So the total revenue is 7200 * 10 = Rs. 72,000. \n\nThe problem says the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. Wait, profit is calculated on the cost, right? Or is it on the selling price? Hmm, the wording here is important. The question says \"the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%.\" \n\nWait, maybe I need to think in terms of cost and selling price. Let me recall that profit percentage is usually calculated on cost price. So, Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price. Then, Profit % = (Profit / Cost Price) * 100. \n\nBut here, the problem states the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%. So perhaps the total revenue (from the 7200 pens) gives a 25% profit over the total manufacturing cost of all 8000 pens. Let me parse that again.\n\nThe company's total revenue is from selling 7200 pens. The total cost is the cost to manufacture all 8000 pens (including the defective ones, since they have to make them anyway). The profit is 25% of the total cost. So:\n\nTotal Revenue = Total Cost + 25% of Total Cost = 1.25 * Total Cost.\n\nTherefore, Total Revenue = 1.25 * Total Cost. \n\nWe can rearrange that to find Total Cost = Total Revenue / 1.25.\n\nTotal Revenue is 7200 * 10 = 72000. So Total Cost = 72000 / 1.25 = 57600. \n\nThen the cost per pen is Total Cost divided by the number of pens manufactured (8000). \n\nSo cost per pen = 57600 / 8000 = let's calculate that. \n\n57600 divided by 8000: 57600 \u00f7 8000. Let me see, 8000 * 7 is 56,000. 57600 -56000 = 1600. 1600 divided by 8000 is 0.2. So total is 7.2. Wait, so 7.2 per pen? But that's option B. But hold on, let me check again because I might have made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let's go step by step again. \n\nTotal revenue is 7200 pens * Rs10 = 72,000. \n\nThe profit is 25% on the total cost. So Profit = 0.25 * Total Cost. \n\nTotal Revenue = Total Cost + Profit = Total Cost + 0.25*Total Cost = 1.25*Total Cost. \n\nSo Total Cost = 72000 /1.25 = 57600. \n\nTotal Cost is for manufacturing 8000 pens. So per pen cost is 57600 /8000. Let me calculate that again. \n\n57600 divided by 8000: \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100: 576 /80. \n\n576 divided by 80: 80*7=560, so 576-560=16. So 7 and 16/80, which is 7.2. \n\nYes, so 7.2. So the cost per pen is Rs 7.2. Which is option B. \n\nWait, but let me think again. The question says \"the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%\". Is the profit calculated on the cost of the manufactured pens? Because that's how I approached it. So the total cost is for manufacturing all pens (including the defective ones). The revenue comes only from the non-defective ones. Then, the profit is 25% on the total cost. \n\nAlternatively, could the 25% profit be on the selling price? If so, then the calculation would be different. Let me check that possibility. \n\nIf profit is 25% on the selling price, then Profit = 0.25 * Selling Price. \n\nTotal Revenue = Selling Price = 72000. \n\nThen Profit is 0.25 *72000 = 18000. \n\nSo Total Cost would be Revenue - Profit = 72000 -18000 =54000. \n\nThen cost per pen would be 54000/8000 = 6.75, which is not one of the options. So probably the first interpretation is correct, that profit is on cost. So the answer would be B) 7.2.\n\nWait, but let me check the problem statement again. The question says \"the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25%.\" Hmm. The wording is a bit ambiguous. The \"on all the manufactured pens\" might refer to the cost of the manufactured pens, which would be the total cost. So then the profit is 25% of the cost, so the revenue is 125% of cost. Which gives the first calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they mean that the profit margin is 25% on the total sales. But that would be different. The problem's wording is critical here. \n\nThe standard way to interpret \"profit of 25%\" without further qualification is usually that the profit is 25% of the cost. So the total selling price is cost plus 25% of cost. So my first calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the cost per pen is 7.2, so answer B. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)6, B)7.2, C)5.6, D)8, E) None. So B is an option. \n\nHmm, so unless I made a mistake in the steps. Let me recheck:\n\nTotal pens needed after rejection: 7200. Since 10% are rejected, so they must make T pens where 0.9T =7200 \u2192 T=8000. That's correct. \n\nTotal revenue is 7200\u00d710 =72,000. \n\nTotal cost is C. Profit is 25% of C. So total revenue = C +0.25C =1.25C \u2192 C=72000/1.25=57,600. \n\n57,600 divided by 8000 pens is 57600/8000. \n\nLet me compute 8000 \u00d7 7 =56,000. 57600-56000=1,600. 1600/8000=0.2. So total 7.2. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B. So I think that's right. The options given include B)7.2, so that's the answer. \n\nWait, but wait another thought. Maybe the problem is considering the cost per good pen? Like, perhaps they think of the cost as only for the non-defective pens? But that doesn't make sense. Because the defective pens are part of the cost. The company has to manufacture all pens, even the defective ones, so their cost includes those. So the total cost is for all 8000 pens. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer is B. So I think that's the right choice.\n",

The \"on all the manufactured pens\" might refer to the cost of the manufactured pens, which would be the total cost. So then the profit is 25% of the cost, so the revenue is 125% of cost. Which gives the first calculation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they mean that the profit margin is 25% on the total sales. But that would be different. The problem's wording is critical here. \n\nThe standard way to interpret \"profit of 25%\" without further qualification is usually that the profit is 25% of the cost. So the total selling price is cost plus 25% of cost. So my first calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the cost per pen is 7.2, so answer B. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)6, B)7.2, C)5.6, D)8, E) None. So B is an option. \n\nHmm, so unless I made a mistake in the steps. Let me recheck:\n\nTotal pens needed after rejection: 7200. Since 10% are rejected, so they must make T pens where 0.9T =7200 \u2192 T=8000. That's correct. \n\nTotal revenue is 7200\u00d710 =72,000. \n\nTotal cost is C. Profit is 25% of C. So total revenue = C +0.25C =1.25C \u2192 C=72000/1.25=57,600. \n\n57,600 divided by 8000 pens is 57600/8000. \n\nLet me compute 8000 \u00d7 7 =56,000. 57600-56000=1,600. 1600/8000=0.2. So total 7.2. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B. So I think that's right. The options given include B)7.2, so that's the answer. \n\nWait, but wait another thought. Maybe the problem is considering the cost per good pen? Like, perhaps they think of the cost as only for the non-defective pens? But that doesn't make sense. Because the defective pens are part of the cost. The company has to manufacture all pens, even the defective ones, so their cost includes those. So the total cost is for all 8000 pens. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. So the answer is B. So I think that's the right choice.\n\n\nTo determine the manufactured cost of each pen, we first calculate the total number of pens produced. Since 10% are defective, 90% of the total production (denoted as \\( T \\)) must equal 7200 acceptable pens:\n\n\\[\n0.9T = 7200 \\implies T = \\frac{7200}{0.9} = 8000 \\text{ pens}.\n\\]\n\nThe total revenue from selling 7200 pens at Rs. 10 each is:\n\n\\[\n7200 \\times 10 = \\text{Rs. } 72,000.\n\\]\n\nThe company\u2019s profit is 25% of the total manufacturing cost. Let \\( C \\) be the total manufacturing cost. The total revenue equals the cost plus 25% of the cost:\n\n\\[\n72,000 = C + 0.25C \\implies 72,000 = 1.25C \\implies C = \\frac{72,000}{1.25} = \\text{Rs. } 57,600.\n\\]\n\nThe manufacturing cost per pen is the total cost divided by the total number of pens produced (8000):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{57,600}{8000} = \\text{Rs. } 7.2.\n\\]\n\nThus, the manufactured cost of each pen is **Rs. 7.2**, corresponding to option **B**.\n\nAnswer: B",
