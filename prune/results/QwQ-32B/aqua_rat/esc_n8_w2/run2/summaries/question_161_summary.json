      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem about Neha and Radha's positions in a row of children. Hmm, the question is asking for the total number of children in the row. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial positions: Neha is 12th from the left end. So her position from the left is 12. Radha is 6th from the right end. So her position from the right is 6. \n\nThen, they shift positions. Radha moves 2 places to the left. So her new position from the right would be 6 + 2 = 8? Wait, no. Wait, if she moves left, her position from the right should decrease by 2. Let me think. Because moving left would mean she's closer to the left end, so the distance from the right end increases. Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the row has N children. Radha is 6th from the right. So her original position from the left is (N - 6 +1) = N-5? Because the position from the left plus position from the right minus 1 equals total. So if she moves 2 places to the left, her new position from the right would be 6 + 2 = 8? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me clarify.\n\nLet me approach this differently. Let's first note their initial positions in terms of left and right.\n\nOriginal positions:\n- Neha is 12th from the left. So her left position is 12.\n- Radha is 6th from the right. So her right position is 6. So her left position would be (Total children - 6 +1) = T -5, where T is total.\n\nAfter shifting:\n- Radha moves 2 places to the left. So her new left position is (original left position -2). Because moving left decreases the left position number? Wait, no. Wait, moving left by two places would mean that if she was at position x from the left, moving left would subtract 2? Wait, actually, positions are counted from the left. Suppose she was at position L from the left. Moving left by two positions would make her new position L-2. For example, if she was at position 5, moving left two would be 3. So yes, subtracting 2.\n\nSimilarly, Neha moves to the right by two places. So her new left position is original 12 +2 =14.\n\nNow, after moving, there are 6 children between them. So the distance between them is 7 (since between A and B, if there are 6 in between, the difference in their positions is 7). The question is whether they are on the same side or opposite. Let me think.\n\nWait, the problem says after shifting, there are 6 children between them. So the distance between their positions (in terms of left positions) should be (distance between them) plus 1 (since positions are counted as separate). So if between them there are 6 kids, then their positions differ by 7.\n\nBut the direction of their movement is important. Let me try to model this.\n\nLet me denote the total number of children as T.\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha's left position: 12\n\nRadha's left position: T - 6 +1 = T -5 (since right end 6th means T -6 +1 from left)\n\nAfter moving:\n\nRadha's new left position: (Original left position of Radha) -2 \u2192 (T -5) -2 = T-7\n\nNeha's new left position: 12 +2 =14\n\nNow, the positions after moving are Radha at T-7 and Neha at 14. The distance between them can be calculated in two ways, depending on their order.\n\nCase 1: If Radha is to the left of Neha. Then the positions would be Radha at T-7, Neha at 14. The distance between them would be (14 - (T-7)) -1. Wait, maybe better to think of the positions:\n\nIf Radha is left of Neha, then (T-7) <14. The number of children between them is (14 - (T-7) -1) = 14 - T +7 -1 = 20 - T. But this must be equal to 6. So 20 - T =6 \u2192 T=14. But that can't be possible because Radha was originally at T-5, so T has to be more than 5+12? Maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the distance between their positions is |(T-7) -14|. The absolute difference between their positions. The number of children between them is (difference -1). So the problem states that there are 6 between them, so difference must be 7.\n\nTherefore, | (T-7) -14 | = 7. \n\nLet me write this equation:\n\n| (T -7) -14 | = 7 \u2192 | T -21 | =7 \u2192 T-21 =7 or T-21 =-7 \u2192 T=28 or T=14.\n\nHmm, so two possibilities here. Let's check each.\n\nFirst, T=28:\n\nThen original positions:\n\nRadha's original left position was T-5=23. So moving left 2, new position is 21.\n\nNeha's new position is 14. So between positions 14 and 21 (assuming Radha is at 21, Neha at14? Wait, no. Wait, if T is 28, then Radha's new position after moving left is T-7 =21. So Radha is at position 21, Neha is at 14. Since 14 is to the left of 21, the distance between them is 21-14 -1 =6? Wait, the number of children between them would be (21-14 -1)=6. Which matches the problem's statement. So that's correct. So T=28 is possible.\n\nNow check T=14. Then original positions:\n\nRadha's original left position would be 14-5=9. After moving left 2, she would be at 7. Neha's new position is 14. So Radha is at 7, Neha at 14. The distance between them would be 14-7 -1 =6. So that's also 6 children between them. Wait, but T=14?\n\nWait, but let's check if the original positions are possible. Original positions: Neha was 12th from left. If T is 14, then the maximum left position is 14, so 12 is okay. Radha was 6th from right, which would be position 14-6+1=9 from left. So that works. But after moving, when T=14, Radha's new position is 7 and Neha is 14. The distance between them is 6 children. That works. So T could be 14 or 28?\n\nWait, but the problem probably requires that when they move, their positions are still valid. Let me check for T=14.\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nRadha's original position from right is 6. So in T=14, that's correct. But when she moves left by 2, she moves to position 7 from the left. So from the right, her new position would be 14 -7 +1 =8. That's okay. But moving two places to the left from her original position (position 9 from left). Moving left two would mean she goes to 7, which is allowed. So that's okay. But the problem is, the answer options don't have 14. The options are 23,27,26,28,29. So T=28 is in the options. T=14 is not. So that must be the correct answer? Because 28 is an option. But why does the equation give two possibilities?\n\nHmm, perhaps I made an error in setting up the equation. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the problem says when they are shifted, there are 6 children between them. So the distance between them is 7 (since between them, so positions differ by 7). The absolute difference between their positions is 7. So the equation | (T-7) -14 | =7. \n\nSo T-7 -14 =7 \u2192 T-21=7 \u2192 T=28. \n\nOr, T-7 -14 =-7 \u2192 T-21 =-7 \u2192 T=14. \n\nSo both solutions are possible. But since T must be at least the maximum of Neha's original position (12) and Radha's original left position (T-5). Let's see:\n\nIf T=14, Radha's original left position was 9 (14-5). So the total children would have to be at least 12 (from Neha's position) and 9 (from Radha's original left) so 14 is okay. But the problem is that after moving, when T=14, Neha moves to 14, which is the end. So her new position is 14, which is the last position. So that's okay. But the answer options don't have 14, so perhaps there's a constraint I'm missing.\n\nWait, maybe the movement can't cross each other? Or perhaps there's another condition. Let's see the problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says when Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to the right by 2 places, there are 6 children between them. So maybe the movement must be possible without overlapping? Like, Radha can't move beyond the start. Let me check for T=14:\n\nOriginal Radha's left position was 9. Moving left 2 would take her to 7, which is okay. Neha moves to 14 (which is the end). So their positions after are 7 and 14, with 6 between them. That works. But since 14 isn't an option, perhaps there's an error in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the initial setup. Let me try a different approach.\n\nAlternative method:\n\nLet\u2019s denote total children as T.\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha is 12th from left \u2192 position L_N =12.\n\nRadha is 6th from right \u2192 position R_R =6 \u2192 so L_R = T -6 +1 = T-5.\n\nAfter shifting:\n\nRadha moves 2 places to the left \u2192 her new position from left is L_R_new = (T-5) -2 = T-7.\n\nNeha moves 2 places to the right \u2192 her new position L_N_new =12 +2 =14.\n\nNow, the distance between them is | (T-7) -14 |. The number of children between them is (distance between positions) minus 1. The problem states that this number is 6.\n\nSo:\n\n| (T-7 -14) | -1 =6 \u2192 |T -21| -1 =6 \u2192 |T-21|=7 \u2192 T-21=\u00b17 \u2192 T=28 or T=14.\n\nSame result as before. Since 14 isn't an option, the answer must be 28 (option D). So that's the correct one.\n\nWait but let me think again. The problem might have another condition. For instance, after moving, are their positions overlapping? Let's see when T=28:\n\nRadha's new position is T-7 =21, Neha is 14. So between them, positions 15 to 20: that's 6 children (since 20-15+1=6? Wait, no, between 14 and21, the positions between are 15-20: that's 6 children, so 6 between them. So that's correct. So 28 is valid.\n\nBut why is T=14 also a solution? The problem might require that after shifting, they are not at the same position. But in T=14, their positions are 7 and14. So that's okay. But since the options don't have 14, perhaps I made an error in the problem's interpretation.\n\nWait the problem says \"there are 6 children between Radha and Neha\". The way I calculated, that's correct. So why is 28 the answer here. Since it's one of the options. So I think the answer is D)28.\n\nWait, but let me try plugging in another option. Let's see option C is 26.\n\nIf T=26:\n\nThen Radha's new position is T-7 =19. Neha is at 14. The difference is 19-14=5. So the number between them is 4 (positions 15-18). Which is less than 6. Not matching.\n\nOption B 27: T-7=20. 20-14=6 \u2192 so the distance between them is 6, so children between them would be 5? Because between 14 and20, the positions 15-19 (5 children). Not 6.\n\nWait, 20-14=6. So the number between is (20-14-1)=5. So not 6.\n\nHmm. So only 28 works. So the answer must be D)28.\n",

So Radha is at 7, Neha at 14. The distance between them would be 14-7 -1 =6. So that's also 6 children between them. Wait, but T=14?\n\nWait, but let's check if the original positions are possible. Original positions: Neha was 12th from left. If T is 14, then the maximum left position is 14, so 12 is okay. Radha was 6th from right, which would be position 14-6+1=9 from left. So that works.

Not 6.\n\nWait, 20-14=6. So the number between is (20-14-1)=5. So not 6.\n\nHmm. So only 28 works. So the answer must be D)28.\n\n\nTo solve the problem, let's analyze the positions step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Positions**:\n   - Neha is 12th from the left.\n   - Radha is 6th from the right.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I need to solve this problem about Neha and Radha's positions in a row of children. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step. \n\nFirst, the initial positions: Neha is 12th from the left end. So if I imagine the row, Neha is at position 12. Radha is 6th from the right end. That means if the total number of children is N, Radha's position from the left would be N - 5 (since 6th from the right is the same as (N - 5 +1) from the left? Wait, maybe I should think of it as N - 6 +1? Wait, no. Let me get this straight. \n\nThe formula for converting from one end to the other is: position from left = total positions - position from right +1. So if Radha is 6th from the right, her position from the left would be (N - 6 +1) = N -5. Right, so her left position is N-5.\n\nNow, the problem says when Radha is shifted to the left by 2 places. Wait, shifting left by two would mean her new position is (N-5) -2 = N-7 from the left? Or wait, maybe shifting left by two places means moving two positions towards the left, so subtracting two from her original left position. Because moving left decreases the position number. \n\nSimilarly, Neha is shifted to the right by two places. So her original position is 12, moving right would add 2, making her new position 14 from the left. \n\nAfter these shifts, there are 6 children between Radha and Neha. Hmm, so the distance between them has to be 6 children plus the two themselves? Or wait, the number of children between them is 6, so the total positions between them would be 7? \n\nWait, the wording says \"there are 6 children between Radha and Neha\". So if they are not adjacent, there are 6 kids in between. Let me think of their positions. Let me denote their new positions after shifting. \n\nLet me denote:\n\nOriginal positions:\nNeha is 12 from left.\nRadha is N-5 from left (since 6th from right).\n\nAfter shifting:\nNeha moves right by 2 \u2192 new position: 12 +2 =14.\nRadha moves left by 2 \u2192 new position: (N-5) -2 = N-7.\n\nNow, the distance between them. Depending on who is to the left, the positions must be such that there are 6 children between them. \n\nWait, which one is on the left after shifting? Let me see: \n\nIf Neha is at 14 and Radha is at N-7, then depending on N's value, their positions could be in different orders. Let's suppose that after shifting, Neha is to the left of Radha. Then the distance between them would be (Radha's position - Neha's position -1) = number of children between them. \n\nAlternatively, if Radha is to the left of Neha, then it would be (Neha's position - Radha's position -1). \n\nWait, perhaps I should consider two cases. \n\nCase 1: After shifting, Neha is to the left of Radha. \n\nThen the number of children between them is (Radha's position - Neha's position -1) =6. \n\nSo: (N-7 -14 -1) =6 \u2192 N -22 =6 \u2192 N=28. \n\nCase 2: Radha is to the left of Neha. Then the number between would be (14 - (N-7) -1)=6 \u2192 14 -N +7 -1 =6 \u2192 20 -N =6 \u2192 N=14. But that can't be possible because Radha was originally 6th from the right. Let me check if N=14 would make sense. Original Radha's position from left was N-5 =9, so in a row of 14, 6th from right is 9th from left. But after shifting, Radha would be at 9-2=7, and Neha is at 14. Then the distance between them would be 14-7-1=6 children between. Wait, so that would be 6 children between them. Wait, but that would mean N=14. But the options don't have 14. So that's impossible, so maybe that case is invalid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe my approach is wrong here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that in the problem statement, after shifting, the positions must be such that there are 6 children between them. So the distance between their positions (the absolute difference between their positions minus 1) should equal 6. \n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nIf two people are at positions x and y (x < y), the number of children between them is (y -x -1). \n\nSo in the problem, after shifting, the positions are Neha at 14, Radha at N-7. \n\nDepending on which is larger between 14 and N-7, the distance between them is |(N-7) -14| -1. \n\nBut the problem states that there are 6 children between them, so that value should be 6. \n\nSo the equation would be:\n\n| (N-7) -14 | -1 =6 \n\nTherefore:\n\n| N -21 | -1 =6 \u2192 |N-21|=7 \u2192 so either N-21 =7 \u2192 N=28, or N-21=-7 \u2192 N=14. \n\nNow, the total number of children can't be 14, because let's check the original positions. \n\nOriginal positions: Neha is 12th from the left. So in a row of 14, she is at 12, which is okay. Radha is 6th from the right, which would be 14-5=9th from left. So her original position is 9. \n\nAfter moving Radha 2 places to the left (so to 7th from left) and Neha moving to 14 (from 12 to 14, so right 2). Then their new positions are 7 and 14. The distance between them is 14-7-1 =6 children between. That's exactly what the problem says. So why is N=14 an option here? But the options given are 23, 27,26,28,29. 14 isn't among them. So maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the other case N=28 is the correct one. Let's check that. \n\nIf N=28, then original positions: \n\nNeha is 12th from left. \n\nRadha's original position from left is 28-5=23. \n\nAfter shifting, Radha moves left by 2 \u2192 23-2=21. \n\nNeha moves right by 2 \u219214. \n\nNow their positions are 14 and 21. \n\nThe distance between them is 21-14 -1 =6 children between. Exactly as required. \n\nSo that's valid. So N=28 is possible, which is option D. \n\nBut why was the other solution N=14 possible? Because the problem's options don't include 14, so probably that case is invalid because maybe the shifting can't happen? Let me see. \n\nWait, when Radha shifts two places to the left, can she do that in a row of 14? Let's see original position of Radha was 9 (from left), moving left two places would take her to 7, which is okay. So that's valid. \n\nBut the problem didn't state any constraints that would rule out N=14. However, the options don't have it, so perhaps there's a mistake in my reasoning. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the direction of shifting. Wait, when moving to the left by two places, does that mean moving towards the left end, so her position number decreases by 2? Yes, that's correct. \n\nWait the problem says \"when Radha is shifted to left by 2 places\". So moving two places to the left. So from her original position (N-5) she moves left two, so new position is (N-5) -2 = N-7. \n\nSimilarly, Neha moving to the right by two: 12 +2 =14. \n\nSo the equations are correct. \n\nHmm, since N=14 is not an option, perhaps there's another condition that I missed? \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that after shifting, their positions can't overlap? Like, if Radha's new position is to the right of Neha's new position, but in the N=14 case, Radha is at 7 and Neha at 14, so she is to the left. So that's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is considering the total positions as the sum of their positions plus the children between them? Wait, no, that's not the way. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the direction of the shift. Let me re-read the problem. \n\n\"When Radha is shifted to left by 2 places and Neha is shifted to right by 2 places there 6 children between Radha and Neha.\"\n\nAh, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of the shift. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nNeha is 12th from left \u2192 position 12.\n\nRadha is 6th from right \u2192 position N -5 from left.\n\nAfter shifting:\n\nRadha shifted left by 2 places: so subtract 2 from her position \u2192 N-5 -2 = N-7.\n\nNeha shifted right by 2 \u2192 add 2 \u2192 14. \n\nSo their new positions are N-7 and 14. \n\nThe distance between them is |N-7 -14| -1 = |N-21| -1. \n\nSet this equal to 6 \u2192 |N-21| -1 =6 \u2192 |N-21|=7 \u2192 N=21+7=28 or 21-7=14. \n\nSo the possible answers are 14 or 28. Since 14 isn't an option, the answer must be 28, which is option D. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D)28.\n",
