      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see here. The problem is about finding the cost price when a trader sold an article at a 20% profit for Rs. 360. Hmm, right. So I need to remember how profit percentages work. \n\nAlright, profit percentage is calculated based on the cost price, right? So the formula should be something like Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit. And the profit here is 20% of the cost price. \n\nLet me write that down. Let's let the cost price be CP. The profit is 20% of CP, so the selling price (SP) would be CP plus 20% of CP. So SP = CP \u00d7 (1 + 20/100). Which simplifies to SP = CP \u00d7 1.2. \n\nThe problem states that the selling price is Rs. 360. So substituting that in, 360 = 1.2 \u00d7 CP. To find CP, I need to divide 360 by 1.2. Let me calculate that. \n\nHmm, 360 divided by 1.2. Well, 1.2 times 300 is 360 because 1.2 \u00d7 300 = 360. Wait, so that would mean the cost price is 300? Let me check that again. If the cost price is 300, then 20% of 300 is 60. Adding that gives 360, which matches the selling price. \n\nLooking at the options, B is 300. So the answer should be B. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as 20% profit means the SP is 120% of CP. So 120% of CP is 360. Therefore, 1% of CP is 360 divided by 120, which is 3. Then 100% would be 3 \u00d7 100 = 300. Yep, that checks out. So definitely B)300 is the right answer.\n",

So the selling price is the cost price plus the profit. The formula for selling price (SP) should be SP = Cost Price (CP) + Profit. And since profit here is 20% of the cost price, the formula can be written as SP = CP + (20% of CP). \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a quicker way. Like, if the profit is 20%, then the selling price is 120% of the cost price. Because 100% is the original cost, plus 20% profit makes it 120%. So, SP = 120% of CP. \n\nThe problem says the selling price is 360. So, setting up the equation: 120% of CP = 360. To find CP, I need to divide 360 by 120% which is the same as multiplying by 100/120. Let me write that out numerically. \n\nSo, CP = 360 / (120/100) = 360 * (100/120).

Yep, that makes sense. \n\nWait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me see another way. Suppose the cost price is x. Then 1.2x = 360.
