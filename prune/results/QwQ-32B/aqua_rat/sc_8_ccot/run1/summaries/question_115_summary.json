      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where n is between 36 and 72, inclusive. I need to find which of the options A to E correctly describes the range of x, where x is given by that fraction. Let me look at the equation again: x equals (n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n plus 4) plus 16) divided by (n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can simplify the expression first?\n\nLet me write it down step by step. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Wait a second, maybe the numerator and denominator can be factored as perfect squares? Let me check.\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me see if that's a perfect square. Let's think of it as (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Suppose a is \u221an times something. Let's see. Let me try to see if the terms can be arranged that way. \n\nWait, the first term is n squared, which is (\u221an)^4, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the terms can be considered as (\u221an * something)^2 plus cross terms. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is (something squared). Let me try to see:\n\nSuppose the numerator is ( \u221an * something + something else ) squared. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the numerator is ( \u221an * (n) + ... ). Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, let's see if the numerator can be written as ( \u221an * (n) + 4 )^2? Wait, let's compute ( \u221an * (n) + 4 )^2. That would be (n^(3/2) +4)^2 = n^3 + 8n^(3/2) +16. No, that's not matching the numerator. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numerator is (n + 2\u221a(n+4)) squared? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in parsing the terms. Let me check the numerator again:\n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: n squared. Second term: 2 multiplied by \u221an multiplied by (n +4). Third term: 16. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I can factor the numerator as ( \u221an * something + something ) squared. Let me think of the terms again. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the numerator is ( \u221an * (n) + 4 )^2. Wait, expanding that would be (n^(3/2) +4)^2 = n^3 + 8n^(3/2) +16. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is ( \u221an * (something else) + ... ). Alternatively, maybe the terms can be arranged differently. Let me see:\n\nWait, perhaps the numerator is (n + 2\u221a(n) * 2)^2? Wait, that might not be right either. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the denominator is a perfect square. Let's look at the denominator: n +4\u221an +4. Hmm, that looks like (\u221an + 2)^2. Because (\u221an)^2 is n, then 2*\u221an *2 is 4\u221an, and 2 squared is 4. Yes! So denominator is (\u221an + 2)^2. That's good.\n\nNow the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me see if that's a square as well. Let me check if it's (something squared). Let me try (n + 2\u221a(n+4))^2? Wait, expanding that would be n\u00b2 + 4n\u221a(n+4) + ... Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe (something else).\n\nWait, let me see the numerator again:\n\nn\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let me factor terms:\n\nLet me see if it can be expressed as (a + b)^2 where a is n and b is something. Let's see:\n\nSuppose a = n, then a\u00b2 = n\u00b2. Then the cross term 2ab would need to be 2\u221an(n+4). So 2ab = 2\u221an(n+4). Then b would be [\u221an(n+4)/a]. But a is n, so substituting, b = [\u221an(n+4)]/n = \u221a(n+4)/\u221an? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numerator is ( \u221an * (\u221an) * something ). Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to see if the numerator can be written as (n + 2\u221an * 2 + ...). Wait, maybe another approach.\n\nWait, let me consider substituting variables. Let me let m = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, m would be between 6 and sqrt(72) which is approximately 8.485. Wait, sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. So m is between 6 and ~8.485.\n\nLet me set m = sqrt(n). Then n = m\u00b2. Substitute into numerator and denominator.\n\nNumerator becomes (m^4) + 2m*(m\u00b2 +4) + 16. Let's compute that:\n\nFirst term: m^4\n\nSecond term: 2m*(m\u00b2 +4) = 2m^3 + 8m\n\nThird term: +16\n\nSo total numerator: m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nDenominator: n +4\u221an +4 = m\u00b2 +4m +4 = (m+2)^2. That's the same as before.\n\nHmm, so numerator is m^4 +2m^3 +8m +16. Hmm, can I factor this? Let me see:\n\nLooking at numerator:\n\nm^4 + 2m^3 + 8m +16. Hmm, maybe group terms:\n\nTake m^4 +2m^3 and 8m +16.\n\nm^3(m + 2) + 8(m + 2) = (m^3 +8)(m+2). Wait, m^3 +8 is (m+2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4). So that gives:\n\n(m+2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4) * (m+2) = (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4). Wait, let's check:\n\nWait, (m^3 +8) factors into (m+2)(m^2 - 2m +4). So then, the first two terms plus the last two terms:\n\n(m^4 +2m^3) + (8m +16) = m^3(m+2) +8(m+2) = (m^3 +8)(m+2) = (m+2)(m\u00b2-2m+4)(m+2). So overall (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4). \n\nSo numerator is (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4). The denominator is (m+2)^2. \n\nTherefore, when we divide numerator by denominator, the (m+2)^2 terms cancel out. So x simplifies to m\u00b2 -2m +4. \n\nOh! That's a big simplification. So x = m\u00b2 -2m +4, where m = sqrt(n). \n\nSo since m is between 6 and sqrt(72) (since n is between 36 and 72), let me compute the minimum and maximum of x in that interval.\n\nFirst, m ranges from 6 (when n=36) up to sqrt(72) \u22488.485 (when n=72). \n\nWe can treat x as a function of m: x(m) = m\u00b2 -2m +4. \n\nThis is a quadratic function in m, which opens upwards (since the coefficient of m\u00b2 is positive). The vertex is at m = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1) = 1. Since the vertex is at m=1, which is far to the left of our interval [6, ~8.485], the function is increasing on this interval. Therefore, the minimum x occurs at m=6, and the maximum at m= sqrt(72).\n\nCompute x at m=6:\n\nx(6) = 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nAt m= sqrt(72): sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. Let me compute m squared here:\n\nm squared is (6\u221a2)^2 = 36*2 =72. So:\n\nx(m) = (72) - 2*(6\u221a2) +4. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, m squared is n, so m squared is 72 when n=72, so substituting:\n\nWait, no, x(m) is m squared minus 2m plus 4. Wait, m is sqrt(n). So when n is 72, m is sqrt(72), so m squared is 72, but in the expression for x, the first term is m squared (so 72), then minus 2m (which is 2*sqrt(72)), plus 4.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\nx at m = sqrt(72):\n\nx = (sqrt(72))\u00b2 -2*sqrt(72) +4 =72 - 2*sqrt(72) +4 =76 - 2*sqrt(72).\n\nCompute sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2) \u22488.485. So 2*sqrt(72) \u224816.97. \n\nSo 76 minus 16.97 is approximately 59.03. \n\nSo the maximum x is about 59.03, and the minimum is exactly 28. \n\nTherefore, the possible values of x are from 28 up to approximately 59.03. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 the upper limit is too low, since we can reach up to ~59.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 upper limit 58 is close, but the lower limit is okay (since 28 is higher than 23). But the maximum here would be under 58? Since the actual maximum is ~59, so 58 is just below. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the question says \"satisfies\" which of the options. Let me check each option's range:\n\nOption C: 25 <x <64 \u2192 lower is okay, but upper is 64 which is higher than our max. So since x can go up to ~59, the upper bound here is okay, but the lower bound of 25 is lower than 28. So the actual x is between 28 and ~59, so the correct interval must have lower bound at least 28 and upper at least ~59. \n\nLooking at options:\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 that's exactly the lower bound (since 28 is the minimum, but the problem says 36 \u2264n \u226472. Wait, when n=36, x is exactly 28. So the minimum is 28. So the lower bound of D is 28, which is correct. The upper limit is 60, which is higher than our maximum of ~59.03. So D's upper limit is okay. \n\nWait, but let me check if the maximum is exactly 76 - 2*sqrt(72). Let me compute that precisely. \n\nsqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2). So 2*sqrt(72) is 12*sqrt(2). \n\nsqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142, so 12*1.4142 \u224816.9704. \n\nSo 76 -16.9704 \u224859.0296. So the maximum x is about 59.03, which is less than 60. So D's upper limit of 60 would include it. \n\nTherefore, the range of x is 28 \u2264x \u2264 ~59.03. So the correct interval must include this. \n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D says 28 <x <60. Since x can reach exactly 28 when n=36. But the option says \"28 <x\", so that would exclude 28. Wait, but n is allowed to be exactly 36. So x would be exactly 28 when n is 36. So the inequality in D is strict (28 < x). So does that mean that D's lower bound is not inclusive? Then 28 is not included, but the problem allows n=36, so x can be 28. So that would make D incorrect?\n\nHmm, this is a critical point. The question says 36 \u2264 n \u226472. So when n is exactly 36, x is exactly 28. So the possible x values include 28. The option D says \"28 < x <60\", so x has to be greater than 28. So 28 is excluded. Therefore D's lower bound is not correct. \n\nHmm, then what's the correct option?\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption C is 25 <x <64. The lower bound of 25 is lower than 28, so 28 is within the range. The upper bound of 64 is higher than 59, so that's okay. So C's interval includes all possible x. But the actual minimum x is 28, so the lower bound in C (25) is lower than needed, but the problem's options may not require tight bounds. Wait, the question says \"satisfies\" which of the options. So if all x in the actual range (28 to ~59) are within the option's interval, then the option is correct. \n\nSo for option C: 25 <x <64. Since 28 is greater than 25, and 59 <64, then all x values are within C's interval. \n\nBut option D's lower limit is 28, which is exactly the minimum. But because it's strict inequality (28 < x), then x=28 is excluded. But since x can be exactly 28 (when n=36), the correct interval must include 28. So D is not correct. \n\nLooking at option B: 23 <x <58. The upper limit here is 58. Since the maximum x is ~59, which is higher than 58, so the upper limit is too low. So B is incorrect. \n\nOption A's upper limit is 54, which is way too low. \n\nSo the only option that includes all possible x values (from 28 up to ~59) is option C, because 25 is lower than 28, and 64 is higher than 59. \n\nWait, but the problem is a multiple-choice question, so the options must have the correct interval. But the question says \"satisfies\", so if the actual x can reach up to ~59, then option D's upper limit of 60 would also include that. But the problem is that D's lower limit is 28 <x, which excludes the case where x is exactly 28, which is possible. \n\nHmm, so which is the correct answer here?\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let me recheck when n=36, x is exactly 28. So the minimum value is 28. The question says 36 \u2264n \u226472, so n can be 36. So x can be 28, so the correct interval must include 28. \n\nLooking at the options again:\n\nC says 25 <x <64. Since 28 is greater than 25, that's okay. So the lower bound is acceptable. \n\nD says 28 <x <60. The lower bound is strict, so x=28 is not included. Since x can be exactly 28, the interval D is not correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct option is C? But wait, let me check the upper limit of C: 64. The maximum x is approximately 59.03, so that's within 64. So C's upper limit is okay. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking which interval x satisfies. So the answer must be an interval that contains all possible x. Since the actual x ranges from 28 to ~59.03, then:\n\nOption C: 25 to 64: yes, all x are in there. \n\nOption D: 28 to 60: all x except the lower point (28) are included. But since x can be exactly 28, D's interval is not correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C?\n\nWait but wait the options are:\n\nC)25 < x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nHmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the simplification?\n\nLet me retrace the steps again to confirm:\n\nOriginal expression: x = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16 ] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me set m = sqrt(n), so n = m\u00b2. Then numerator is:\n\nn\u00b2 = m^4,\n\n2\u221an (n+4) = 2m*(m\u00b2 +4),\n\nand +16. So adding all together: m^4 + 2m(m\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nExpanding that:\n\nm^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16.\n\nDenominator is m\u00b2 +4m +4 = (m+2)^2.\n\nThen, as I did before, factoring numerator:\n\nm^4 +2m^3 +8m +16. \n\nGroup terms as (m^4 +2m^3) + (8m +16) = m^3(m+2) +8(m+2) = (m^3 +8)(m+2). \n\nFactor m^3 +8 as (m+2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4). So total numerator is (m+2)(m\u00b2-2m+4)(m+2) = (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4). \n\nDivided by denominator (m+2)^2, so x = m\u00b2 -2m +4. \n\nYes, that's correct. So x = m\u00b2 - 2m +4. \n\nAt m=6, x is 36 -12 +4 =28. Correct. \n\nAt m= sqrt(72)=6\u221a2, so m squared is (6\u221a2)^2 =36*2=72. So x =72 -2*(6\u221a2) +4 =76 -12\u221a2. \n\nWait, 12\u221a2 is approximately 16.97, so 76 -16.97 is indeed ~59.03. \n\nSo the maximum x is approximately 59.03. \n\nNow, the options:\n\nC: 25 <x <64: since 28>25 and 59.03 <64, so yes, all x are in C's interval. \n\nD: 28 <x <60: The lower bound excludes 28, which is possible, so D is not correct. \n\nSo the correct answer must be C? \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The question says \"satisfies\". So if the options are ranges that x must lie within, then the correct answer is the one that fully contains all possible x values. \n\nSo option C's upper bound is 64, which is higher than needed, but it's still a valid upper bound. Since all x are less than 64, then C is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something else. Let me see other options. \n\nWait, the problem says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\". So n can be 72. Let me compute x when n=72 exactly. \n\nx = m\u00b2 -2m +4, where m = sqrt(72) =6\u221a2 \u22488.485. \n\nSo substituting exactly:\n\nx = (6\u221a2)^2 - 2*(6\u221a2) +4 =72 -12\u221a2 +4 =76 -12\u221a2. \n\n12\u221a2 is exactly about 16.97056. \n\nSo 76 -16.97056 =59.0294. So approximately 59.03. \n\nThus, the upper limit is about 59.03, so the maximum x is under 60. So D's upper limit of 60 would include it. But D's lower limit is 28 <x, so when n=36, x=28 is excluded. Since the question allows n=36, the x can be 28, so D is not correct. \n\nTherefore, the only option that includes all possible x is C. So the answer should be option C. \n\nWait, but looking back at the options, option C says 25 < x <64. The minimum x is 28, so the lower bound of 25 is okay. The upper is 64, which is more than enough. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the numerator's factorization? Let me check again. \n\nWait, the numerator after substitution is m^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16. \n\nWait, when grouping as (m^4 +2m^3) + (8m +16), that's m^3(m+2) +8(m+2) = (m^3 +8)(m+2). \n\nThen m^3 +8 factors into (m+2)(m\u00b2 -2m +4). So the entire numerator becomes (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2-2m+4). \n\nYes, so that's correct. So when divided by denominator (m+2)^2, cancels out, leaving m\u00b2-2m+4. \n\nTherefore, my earlier steps are correct. \n\nHmm, so then the correct answer must be C. But looking at the options again, maybe I made a mistake in the question's upper and lower n? Let me check the question again. \n\nThe question says 36 \u2264n \u226472. So n is between 36 and 72, which is correct. \n\nWait, but wait, in the numerator, when I set m = sqrt(n), then m ranges from 6 (sqrt(36)) up to sqrt(72) \u22488.485. \n\nSo the expression x(m) = m\u00b2 -2m +4. \n\nThis is a quadratic in m, and since the coefficient of m\u00b2 is positive, it's a parabola opening upwards. The vertex is at m = 1, which is far to the left of the interval. So on the interval [6, ~8.485], the function is increasing. \n\nThus, the minimum is at m=6 (28) and maximum at m= sqrt(72) (~59.03). \n\nThus the possible x values are between 28 and ~59.03. \n\nTherefore, the options:\n\nC)25 <x <64: includes all x.\n\nD)28 <x <60: excludes x=28 and includes up to ~59.03 which is under 60. \n\nBut the question allows x=28, so D is invalid. \n\nThus, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but the options given in the problem are:\n\nA)20 <x <54\n\nB)23 <x<58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm. So according to my analysis, C is the correct answer. But let me check why the options D might be tempting. Because the actual maximum is ~59, which is under 60, so D's upper limit is okay, but the lower limit is strict. \n\nWait, the question says \"satisfies\". If the answer requires the tightest possible interval, then perhaps the question is looking for the minimal interval that includes all x. \n\nBut the options don't have that. So since C is the only one that includes all x (since 25 <28 and 64>59), then C is correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question requires the inequality to be strict (like x is strictly greater than the lower and less than the upper). Since when n=36, x=28, so 28 is included. So for option C, 25 <x would include 28. \n\nYes, since 28>25. So the answer is C. \n\nWait, but in the options, option D's lower bound is 28, but it's written as \"28 <x\", so it excludes 28. So since x can be exactly 28, then option C is the only one that includes all possible x values. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution? Let me test with n=36. \n\nn=36: x=(36\u00b2 + 2*6*(36+4)+16)/(36 +4*6 +4). Let's compute numerator:\n\n36\u00b2 is 1296. \n\n2*sqrt(36)=2*6=12. Then 12*(36+4)=12*40=480. \n\nAdd 16: 1296 +480 =1776 +16=1792. \n\nDenominator:36 +24 +4=64. \n\nSo x=1792/64 =28. Correct. \n\nNow n=72:\n\nCompute numerator: 72\u00b2 +2*sqrt(72)*(72+4)+16. \n\n72 squared is 5184. \n\nsqrt(72)=6\u221a2\u22488.485. \n\n2*8.485\u224816.97. \n\n72+4=76. \n\nSo 16.97*76 \u224816.97*70=1187.9 plus 16.97*6=101.82 \u2192 total \u22481289.72. \n\nAdding to 5184: 5184 +1289.72 \u22486473.72 +16 is 6489.72. \n\nDenominator:72 +4*sqrt(72)+4 =72 +4*(8.485) +4. \n\n4*8.485\u224833.94. \n\nSo total denominator:72+33.94=105.94 +4=110. \n\nWait, wait, but according to the formula, denominator is (m+2)^2 where m=sqrt(72)=~8.485, so (8.485+2)^2 \u2248 (10.485)^2\u2248110. So yes. \n\nSo x numerator is numerator / denominator \u22486489.72 /110 \u224859.0 (as before). \n\nSo x is about 59. \n\nTherefore, the maximum is ~59. \n\nSo the options again:\n\nC says up to 64, which is correct. \n\nD's upper limit is 60, which is also correct but the lower limit is too strict. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nSo the question is, which of these must be true for all x in the given n's. \n\nSince x can be exactly 28, the option C includes it (since 28>25). So C is valid. \n\nD's lower bound is 28, but since x can equal 28, the strict inequality is violated. So D is incorrect. \n\nThus, the answer must be C. \n\nHmm, but let me check why the options might have D. Did I miscalculate something?\n\nWait, the problem says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\". So n can be 36, making x=28, which is the minimal value. \n\nThe options:\n\nC)25 <x <64: includes all x, including 28. \n\nD)28 <x <60: excludes x=28, but includes the rest. \n\nTherefore, since x can be exactly 28, which is not in D's interval, D is not correct. \n\nHence, the correct answer is C. \n\nTherefore, the answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The problem might have a trick. Let me see the numerator again. \n\nWait, the numerator was written as n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. \n\nWait, is that 2\u221an multiplied by (n+4)? Yes. So when I did substitution, that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there was a misinterpretation of the numerator. Like, maybe it's 2 times sqrt(n(n+4)), but the original problem says 2\u221an(n+4). \n\nThe original question says \"2\u221an(n +4)\". The way it's written could be ambiguous, but according to standard order of operations, it's 2 multiplied by sqrt(n) multiplied by (n+4). So my interpretation is correct. \n\nThus, the answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the problem's options again. Option C says \"25 <x <64\". The minimal x is 28, so the lower bound is okay. The upper bound is 64 which is higher than the maximum x of ~59, so that's okay. \n\nThus, the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but the options given in the problem include E) None of these. So perhaps I made a mistake?\n\nWait, let me see the options again. \n\nWait, if the question requires the inequalities to be strict (like x is strictly less than 60?), but the maximum x is ~59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper limit is okay. \n\nBut the lower limit of D is 28 <x, but x can be exactly 28, so D is not correct. \n\nHence, the only option that covers all possible x is C. So the answer should be C. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the simplification steps. Let me try plugging in n=36 into the original equation again. \n\nOriginal equation:\n\nx = [36\u00b2 + 2*sqrt(36)*(36+4) +16]/[36 +4*sqrt(36)+4]\n\nCalculates to:\n\nNumerator: 1296 + 2*6*(40) +16 = 1296 + 480 +16 = 1792. \n\nDenominator: 36 +24 +4 =64. \n\n1792/64 =28. Correct. \n\nAnother test with n=49 (sqrt(49)=7):\n\nx = m\u00b2-2m+4 =49-14+4=39. \n\nOriginal formula: \n\nNumerator:49\u00b2 +2*7*(49+4)+16 = 2401 + 2*7*53 +16. \n\n2*7=14, 14*53=742. 2401+742=3143 +16=3159. \n\nDenominator:49 +4*7 +4 =49+28+4=81. \n\n3159 /81 =39. Correct. \n\nAnother test with n=64 (sqrt(64)=8):\n\nx =8\u00b2-2*8 +4 =64-16+4=52. \n\nOriginal formula: numerator=64\u00b2 +2*8*(64+4)+16 =4096 + 2*8*68 +16. \n\n2*8=16, 16*68=1088. 4096+1088=5184 +16=5200. \n\nDenominator:64+32+4=100. \n\n5200/100=52. Correct. \n\nSo when n=64, x=52. \n\nNow check with n=72, we have x\u224859.03. \n\nSo the maximum is about 59. \n\nTherefore, the interval for x is from 28 to ~59. \n\nThus, the options:\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, all values are in this range. \n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 except for x=28, but since x can be 28, D is invalid. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nHmm, but the options include E) None of these. Maybe the question is designed such that the actual minimum is 28 and maximum ~59.03, so the correct interval is 28 \u2264x <60, but since 28 is included, and the options D says 28 <x, so E would be correct? \n\nWait, the problem says \"satisfies\". So for example, if the question is which interval must contain x, then the correct answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, if the question requires the tightest possible interval, then none of the options except D would be close, but since D excludes the minimum, it's not. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Wait, let me see the problem again. \n\nWait, the numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. \n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the order of operations. For example, if the expression was n\u00b2 + 2\u221a[n(n+4)] +16, but that's not what the problem says. The problem has 2\u221an multiplied by (n+4). \n\nSo no, my initial calculation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer must be C. \n\nThus, the answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The problem says \"36 \u2264n \u226472\", so when n=36, x=28. So the minimal x is 28, so the lower bound must be \u226428. The options C has 25 which is lower, so that's okay. \n\nThe upper bound of C is 64, which is higher than the maximum x. So C is correct. \n\nTherefore the answer is C. \n\nHmm, but the initial thought was maybe D, but due to the lower limit being strict, it's not. So the answer must be C. \n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is C. \n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)20 <x <54 \u2192 upper is too low.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 upper is 58, but max is ~59, so no.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 excludes x=28.\n\nE) None of these.\n\nHmm. Since the problem allows x=28, which is not included in D's interval, then D is not correct. So the only correct option is C. \n\nSo the answer is C. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"36 \u2264 n \u226472\", so the minimal x is 28, so the interval must include 28. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nYes, so I think the answer is C. \n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the problem's numerator. Let me check again. \n\nOriginal problem:\n\nx = (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) / (n +4\u221an +4). \n\nYes, that's exactly what I considered. \n\nThus, my conclusion is C. \n\nWait, but looking at the options again, C's lower bound is 25, which is 3 less than the actual minimum. Since the question is from a test, perhaps there is a mistake here. But according to the calculations, the correct answer is C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra steps. Let me re-derive the simplification. \n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16. \n\nLet me write each term:\n\nFirst term: n\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: 2\u221an*(n) + 2\u221an*4 \u2192 2n^(3/2) +8\u221an. \n\nThird term: +16. \n\nSo the numerator is n\u00b2 +2n^(3/2)+8\u221an +16. \n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. \n\nWait, but when I let m = sqrt(n), then n = m\u00b2, so substituting into numerator:\n\nm^4 + 2m^3 +8m +16. \n\nWhich factors into (m+2)^2 (m\u00b2 -2m +4). \n\nDivided by denominator (m+2)^2, gives m\u00b2-2m+4. \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, the simplification is correct. \n\nThus, I think the correct answer is C. \n\nTherefore, I will choose C. \n\nWait, but I just saw another possibility. Let me think: the problem says 36 \u2264n \u226472. The value of x when n=72 is approximately 59.03, which is just under 60. So the maximum is less than 60. \n\nSo the upper bound of D (60) is acceptable. The lower bound is 28 <x. But since x can be exactly 28, the strict inequality makes D's interval exclude that point, so it's invalid. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. \n\nYes, so I think I'm confident in that. \n\n**Final Answer**\nAnswer: C\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by simplifying the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\nWe substitute \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = m^2 \\). This transforms the expression into:\n\n**Numerator:**\n\\[\nm^4 + 2m(m^2 + 4) + 16 = m^4 + 2m^3 + 8m + 16\n\\]\n\n**Denominator:**\n\\[\nm^2 + 4m + 4 = (m + 2)^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we factor the numerator:\n\\[\nm^4 + 2m^3 + 8m + 16 = (m^3 + 8)(m + 2) = (m + 2)(m^2 - 2m + 4)(m + 2)\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies the expression to:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{(m + 2)^2 (m^2 - 2m + 4)}{(m + 2)^2} = m^2 - 2m + 4\n\\]\n\nSince \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\), \\( m = \\sqrt{n} \\) ranges from \\( 6 \\) to \\( \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485 \\). We evaluate \\( x \\) at the endpoints:\n\n- **When \\( m = 6 \\):**\n  \\[\n  x = 6^2 - 2 \\cdot 6 + 4 = 36 - 12 + 4 = 28\n  \\]\n\n- **When \\( m = \\sqrt{72} \\approx 8.485 \\):**\n  \\[\n  x \\approx (8.485)^2 - 2 \\cdot 8.485 + 4 \\approx 72 - 16.97 + 4 \\approx 59.03\n  \\]\n\nThus, \\( x \\) ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03. Evaluating the options:\n\n- **Option C (25 < x < 64)** includes all values of \\( x \\) since 28 > 25 and 59.03 < 64.\n- **Option D (28 < x < 60)** excludes \\( x = 28 \\), which is possible when \\( n = 36 \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **C**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",
