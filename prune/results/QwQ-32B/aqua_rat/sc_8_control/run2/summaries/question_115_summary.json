      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find which interval the value of x falls into, given that n is between 36 and 72. The expression for x is (n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n +4) +16) divided by (n +4\u221an +4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me try to simplify it step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the expression again to make sure I have it right. The numerator is n squared plus 2 times the square root of n times (n +4) plus 16. The denominator is n plus 4 times the square root of n plus 4. Wait, maybe I should parse the terms correctly. Let me check the parentheses again. The numerator is n\u00b2 + 2\u221an*(n +4) +16. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4. \n\nHmm, maybe I can factor the numerator and denominator. Let me see. Sometimes these expressions can be rewritten as squares or something similar. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the numerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16. Let's see if this can be a perfect square. Let me think of it as (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab + b\u00b2. Let me see if the terms fit that.\n\nSuppose a is \u221an, so a\u00b2 would be n. But the first term is n squared, which is much bigger. Wait, maybe a different approach. Let me try substituting variables. Let\u2019s let\u2019s set t = \u221an. Since n is between 36 and 72, then t would be between 6 and sqrt(72). Wait sqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2), which is about 8.485. But maybe substituting t makes it easier.\n\nLet me try that substitution. Let t = sqrt(n), so n = t\u00b2. Then substituting into the numerator:\n\nn\u00b2 becomes (t\u00b2)^2 = t^4.\n\nThe next term is 2\u221an*(n +4). Since \u221an is t, and n is t\u00b2, this becomes 2t*(t\u00b2 +4).\n\nThe last term is +16. So the numerator is:\n\nt^4 + 2t(t\u00b2 +4) +16.\n\nLet me expand that middle term: 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 +8t. So the numerator becomes t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, not sure yet. Let me see if this can be factored. Let me try grouping terms.\n\nWait, perhaps the entire numerator can be written as (t\u00b2 + a t + b)^2? Let me check. Let's suppose that the numerator is a square of something like (t\u00b2 + at + b). Let's see:\n\n(t\u00b2 + a t + b)^2 = t^4 + 2a t^3 + (a\u00b2 + 2b)t\u00b2 + 2ab t + b\u00b2. Comparing with numerator terms: t^4 + 2t^3 + ... Hmm, the original numerator's coefficients for t^4 is 1, t^3 is 2, but the next term is 8t and then 16. Wait, maybe the numerator isn't a perfect square. Hmm, maybe I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me look at the denominator. The denominator is n +4\u221an +4. Again, substituting t = sqrt(n), so n is t\u00b2. So denominator becomes t\u00b2 +4t +4. Oh! That's a perfect square. Because t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t + 2)^2. That's nice. \n\nSo denominator simplifies to (sqrt(n) + 2)^2. \n\nNow, what about the numerator? Let's see:\n\nNumerator: n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n +4) +16. Let me see if I can also write that as a square. Let me try substituting t again. So numerator is t^4 +2t(t\u00b2 +4) +16. Let's compute that again:\n\nt^4 + 2t^3 +8t +16. Hmm, maybe that can also be written as (t^2 + a t + b)^2? Let's see:\n\nSuppose (t^2 + a t + b)^2 = t^4 + 2a t^3 + (a\u00b2 + 2b) t^2 + 2ab t + b\u00b2. Comparing to numerator terms, which are t^4 +2t^3 +0 t^2 +8t +16. \n\nSo equate coefficients:\n\n2a = 2 \u2192 a =1.\n\nThen, the coefficient of t^2 term: a\u00b2 + 2b must equal 0. Since a is 1, that's 1 +2b =0 \u2192 2b = -1 \u2192 b = -0.5. But then the next term is 2ab t. Let's see, 2*(1)*(-0.5) = -1. But in the numerator, the coefficient of t is +8. That's conflicting. Hmm, so that approach might not work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another grouping. Let me try to see if the numerator can be expressed as (t^3 + ... ) but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps numerator is (t^2 + 2)^2? Let me check:\n\n(t^2 + 2)^2 = t^4 +4t\u00b2 +4. But our numerator has t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe the numerator is (t^2 + 2t + 4)^2? Let me compute that:\n\n(t^2 +2t +4)^2 = t^4 +4t^3 + (4t\u00b2 + 8t\u00b2?) Wait, let's compute step by step:\n\nFirst, (t^2 + 2t +4)^2:\n\n= (t^2)^2 + (2t)^2 + (4)^2 + 2*(t^2)(2t) + 2*(t^2)(4) + 2*(2t)(4)\n\n= t^4 +4t\u00b2 +16 + 4t\u00b3 +8t\u00b2 +16t \n\nCombine terms:\n\nt^4 +4t^3 + (4t\u00b2+8t\u00b2)=12t\u00b2 +16t +16. Hmm, not matching the numerator terms which have 2t^3, no t\u00b2 term, 8t and 16. So that's not it either.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. The numerator is t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Maybe there's a different way to factor. Alternatively, perhaps the numerator is (t^3 + something) multiplied by something else. Not sure. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire fraction can be simplified. Let me see:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an (n+4) +16 ] / [n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me see if numerator can be written in terms of denominator squared or something. Since denominator is (sqrt(n) +2)^2, as I saw earlier. Let me denote D = denominator = (sqrt(n)+2)^2.\n\nThe numerator: Let me try to see if numerator is (n + 2 sqrt(n) + something)^2. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps numerator is (n + something)^2 plus cross terms?\n\nAlternatively, let me try plugging in t = sqrt(n) again. Let me re-express numerator and denominator in terms of t:\n\nNumerator is t^4 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16. Let's compute that again step by step:\n\nFirst term: t^4.\n\nSecond term: 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) = 2t^3 +8t.\n\nThird term: +16.\n\nSo adding all together: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nHmm, maybe this can be written as (t^4 + 2t^3) + (8t +16). Let me factor those parts:\n\nt^3 (t +2) +8(t +2). Oh! Wait a second! That's (t^3 +8)(t +2). Wait:\n\nWait, t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16 = t^3(t+2) +8(t+2) = (t^3 +8)(t+2). Oh! That's a good factorization.\n\nBecause (t^3 +8) factors as (t +2)(t^2 -2t +4), since it's a sum of cubes: a^3 + b^3 = (a +b)(a\u00b2 -ab + b\u00b2). Here a is t, b is 2, so t^3 +8 = (t +2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4). \n\nTherefore, the numerator becomes (t +2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4)(t +2) ? Wait wait, no, let me see:\n\nWait, the first factor is (t^3 +8) = (t+2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4). Then multiplied by (t +2). So overall, (t+2)*(t\u00b2 -2t +4)*(t +2) = (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). \n\nSo numerator is (t +2)^2*(t\u00b2 -2t +4). \n\nDenominator is (t +2)^2. \n\nTherefore, when we divide numerator by denominator, the (t +2)^2 terms cancel out, so x = (t\u00b2 -2t +4). \n\nOh! That simplifies things a lot. So x is equal to t\u00b2 -2t +4, where t is sqrt(n). Since t = sqrt(n), then x = (sqrt(n))\u00b2 - 2 sqrt(n) +4 = n -2\u221an +4. \n\nWait, wait a second. Let me confirm that again. Because substituting back:\n\nWait, the numerator was (t+2)^2*(t\u00b2 - 2t +4), denominator is (t+2)^2. So yes, cancelling (t+2)^2 gives x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. Since t is sqrt(n), then t squared is n, so substituting back:\n\nx = n - 2\u221an +4. \n\nAh, okay, so x simplifies to n minus twice the square root of n plus 4. That's much easier to handle.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the range of x = n -2\u221an +4 where n is between 36 and 72 inclusive. Since n is between 36 and 72, let me compute x at the endpoints first, and see how it behaves in between.\n\nFirst, let's compute when n =36:\n\nx = 36 -2*sqrt(36) +4 = 36 -2*6 +4 = 36 -12 +4 = 28.\n\nWhen n=72:\n\nx =72 -2*sqrt(72) +4. Let's compute sqrt(72) = 6*sqrt(2) \u22486*1.4142\u22488.485. So 2*sqrt(72) \u224816.97. So x \u224872 -16.97 +4 \u2248 (72+4) -16.97 =76 -16.97\u224859.03.\n\nWait, so at n=36, x is exactly 28. At n=72, it's approximately 59.03. Now, the question is: is the function x(n) increasing or decreasing between n=36 and 72?\n\nLet me see the expression x(n) = n -2\u221an +4. To find its behavior, we can take the derivative with respect to n, but since this is a calculus approach, maybe I can reason it without calculus. Alternatively, since we can consider the function as a function of t, where t= sqrt(n). Let me try that.\n\nLet me let t = sqrt(n), so t ranges from sqrt(36)=6 to sqrt(72)\u22488.485. Then x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. \n\nExpressed as x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4. \n\nThis is a quadratic in t. The quadratic equation x(t) = t\u00b2 -2t +4. The graph of this is a parabola opening upwards, since the coefficient of t\u00b2 is positive. The vertex is at t = -b/(2a) = 2/(2*1)=1. So the vertex is at t=1. Since our t starts at 6, which is way to the right of the vertex, the function is increasing for t>1. Therefore, as t increases from 6 to ~8.485, x(t) will be increasing. So the minimum value of x is at t=6 (n=36) which is 6\u00b2 -2*6 +4 = 36-12+4=28. The maximum is at t\u22488.485 (n=72), which gives x\u2248 (8.485)^2 -2*(8.485)+4. Let's compute that.\n\nCalculating (8.485)^2: 8.485 squared. Let me compute 8.485 squared. Let's approximate:\n\n8.485^2 = (8 +0.485)^2 = 8\u00b2 + 2*8*0.485 + 0.485\u00b2 =64 + 7.76 + 0.235225 \u224864 +7.76=71.76 +0.235\u224872. So actually, since sqrt(72) is exactly 8.485..., so (sqrt(72))\u00b2 is exactly 72. Wait, but in the expression x(t) when t = sqrt(72), which is sqrt(72), then x(t) would be (sqrt(72))\u00b2 - 2*sqrt(72) +4 =72 -2*sqrt(72) +4. Which is exactly the same as when n=72, so that's consistent with the earlier calculation. \n\nBut the maximum x at t= sqrt(72) is 72 -2*sqrt(72) +4. Let me compute that exactly:\n\nsqrt(72) is 6*sqrt(2). So 2*sqrt(72)=12*sqrt(2). So x =72 +4 -12\u221a2 =76 -12\u221a2.\n\nWe can compute 12\u221a2 \u224812*1.4142\u224816.9704. So 76 -16.9704\u224859.0296, so approximately 59.03. \n\nSo the function x(n) increases from 28 to approximately 59.03 as n goes from 36 to 72. \n\nNow, the options given are:\n\nA)20 <x<54 \u2192 28 is above 20, but 59 is above 54. So this is too low on the upper end.\n\nB)23 <x<58 \u2192 59.03 is higher than 58, so upper limit is too low.\n\nC)25 <x<64 \u2192 28 is within 25, and 59.03 is under 64. So this would include all values. Wait, but let's check the other options first.\n\nD)28 <x<60 \u2192 The lower limit here is 28. The minimum x is exactly 28, so the inequality is \"28 < x <60\". Since at n=36, x is exactly 28, so the inequality is strict. But the question says 36 \u2264 n \u226472, so n can be 36, which gives x=28. So the interval given in D is 28 <x <60. Since x can be exactly 28, which is not included in D's lower bound, so D is not correct. \n\nE)None of these.\n\nLooking at option C: 25 <x <64. Since 28 is greater than 25, and 59.03 is less than 64, the entire range of x is within 25 to 64. So option C would include all possible x values. \n\nWait but let me check option C's exact wording: \"25 <x <64\". Since the minimum x is 28, which is above 25, so the lower bound is okay. The maximum is ~59, which is less than 64. So the entire range of x (28 to ~59.03) is within 25 to 64. Therefore, option C says \"25 <x <64\", which would be true because all x values lie within that interval. \n\nBut wait, let me check the other options again. The question says \"satisfies\" which of the options. The options are ranges. So if the x is between 28 and ~59.03, then:\n\nOption C's upper limit is 64, which is higher than the actual max, but the lower limit is 25, which is lower than the actual min. Since all x's are between 28 and ~59, then 25 <x <64 is indeed true. So option C would be correct. \n\nWait but let me check the other options again. Option D is 28 <x <60. Since the maximum x is ~59.03, which is less than 60, so D's upper bound is okay. But the lower bound is 28, but x can be exactly 28 when n=36. Since the inequality is strict (28 <x), then when x is exactly 28, it's not included. So the actual x can reach 28, so D's interval doesn't include that, so D is not correct. \n\nOption B's upper bound is 58, but the maximum x is ~59, which is higher than 58, so B is too low on upper. \n\nSo the correct answer must be C. Wait, but wait, let me check if there's any possible mistake in my calculation. Let me recheck the simplification steps again. \n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me test with n=36. Plugging in:\n\nNumerator: 36\u00b2 + 2*6*(36 +4) +16 = 1296 + 2*6*40 +16 = 1296 + 480 +16 = 1296+496=1792.\n\nDenominator: 36 +4*6 +4 =36 +24 +4=64.\n\n1792/64 =28. That checks out. \n\nTesting n=72:\n\nNumerator: 72\u00b2 + 2*sqrt(72)*(72+4)+16.\n\nsqrt(72) is 6\u221a2 \u22488.485. \n\n72\u00b2 is 5184.\n\n2*sqrt(72)*(76) = 2*8.485*76 \u224816.97*76 \u22481290. So numerator \u22485184 +1290 +16 \u22485184+1306=6490. \n\nDenominator:72 +4*sqrt(72)+4 \u224872 + 33.94 +4\u2248109.94.\n\nSo x\u22486490/109.94\u2248 approximately 6490 divided by ~110 is about 59. So that's correct. \n\nSo the maximum is around 59.03, so the upper limit in option C is 64, which is acceptable. So C's interval is 25 to 64, which contains all x values. So the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)20 < x < 54 \u2192 no, since 28 is above 20 but 59 exceeds 54.\n\nB)23 <x <58 \u2192 58 is less than 59, so no.\n\nC)25 <x <64 \u2192 yes, includes all.\n\nD)28 <x <60 \u2192 includes except exactly 28 and up to ~59. But since x can be exactly 28 when n=36, then the inequality 28 <x would exclude that case. Since the question states \"36 \u2264n \u226472\", so x can be 28. Therefore D's lower bound is not inclusive. So D is incorrect. \n\nTherefore the correct answer is C. \n\nWait but the options are given as A to E, and E is \"None of these\". Wait but according to the analysis, C is correct. So why is the option E not correct?\n\nWait let me re-read the options again carefully.\n\nOptions:\n\nA)20 < x < 54\n\nB)23 <x <58\n\nC)25 <x <64\n\nD)28 <x <60\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm, the problem states that x must satisfy which of the options. Since the x ranges from 28 (inclusive) to ~59.03 (exclusive of 60?), but actually, at n=72, x is approximately 59.03, so less than 60. \n\nWait, so the maximum x is less than 60. So D's upper limit is 60, so x is less than 60. But the lower limit for D is 28 <x, but when n=36, x=28. So the interval D is 28 <x <60, which excludes 28. Since x can be exactly 28 when n=36, the correct interval must include 28. Therefore D is not correct. \n\nC's interval is 25 <x <64. Since 28 is greater than 25 and 59.03 is less than 64, all values of x lie within C's interval. So the correct answer is C. So the answer should be C. \n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. The question says \"satisfies\". So if x is between 28 and ~59.03, then the only option that fully contains this interval is C. Because 25 <x <64 includes all x's. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C. So the answer is option C. \n\nWait but the options are given as A to E, so the answer is C. Therefore I think the correct answer is C. \n\nWait but let me check if there's a miscalculation. Suppose I made a mistake in the algebra when simplifying the expression. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\nx = [n\u00b2 + 2\u221an(n+4) +16]/[n +4\u221an +4]\n\nLet me substitute n = t\u00b2, so sqrt(n) = t. \n\nNumerator becomes:\n\n(t\u00b2)^2 + 2t*(t\u00b2 +4) +16 = t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16.\n\nDenominator is t\u00b2 +4t +4 = (t+2)^2.\n\nThen, numerator: t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. \n\nWait, when I factored this earlier as (t^3 +8)(t +2). Let me verify that:\n\n(t^3 +8)(t +2) = t^4 +2t^3 +8t +16. Exactly. \n\nTherefore numerator is (t^3 +8)(t+2). \n\nThen denominator is (t+2)^2. \n\nTherefore, x = [ (t^3 +8)(t +2) ] / (t+2)^2 = (t^3 +8)/(t +2).\n\nWait a minute! Wait, I think I made a mistake here earlier. Let me see again. \n\nThe numerator is (t^3 +8)(t +2), denominator is (t +2)^2. So when you divide, it's (t^3 +8)/(t +2). \n\nAh! Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. I thought it was (t^2 -2t +4), but maybe I miscalculated the division. Let me re-express:\n\nThe numerator was factored as (t^3 +8)(t +2). The denominator is (t +2)^2. \n\nSo x = (t^3 +8)/(t +2). \n\nBut t^3 +8 can be factored as (t +2)(t\u00b2 -2t +4). Therefore, (t^3 +8)/(t +2) = t\u00b2 -2t +4. \n\nAh, so that's correct. So indeed, the t+2 cancels, giving t\u00b2 -2t +4. Which is the same as before. So my previous steps were correct. \n\nSo the expression x = t\u00b2 -2t +4. So when t =6 (n=36), x=36-12+4=28. When t= sqrt(72) \u22488.485, x\u2248 (8.485)^2 - 2*(8.485)+4. Let me compute that again:\n\n(8.485)^2 is exactly 72 (since t^2 =n, so when t is sqrt(72), then t squared is 72). So substituting back, x=72 -2*sqrt(72) +4. Which is exactly what we had before. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nSo the conclusion is that the correct answer is C. So the answer is option C. \n\nWait, but let me check if any of the options have a lower bound less than 28 and upper bound higher than ~59.03. Option C does. So the answer is C. \n\nTherefore the correct option is C. \n\n**Final Answer**\nAnswer: C\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start with the given expression for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{n^2 + 2\\sqrt{n}(n + 4) + 16}{n + 4\\sqrt{n} + 4}\n\\]\n\nWe substitute \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = t^2 \\). This transforms the expression into:\n\n**Numerator**:\n\\[\nt^4 + 2t(t^2 + 4) + 16 = t^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16\n\\]\n\n**Denominator**:\n\\[\nt^2 + 4t + 4 = (t + 2)^2\n\\]\n\nWe factor the numerator:\n\\[\nt^4 + 2t^3 + 8t + 16 = (t^3 + 8)(t + 2)\n\\]\n\nRecognizing \\( t^3 + 8 \\) as a sum of cubes, we factor it further:\n\\[\nt^3 + 8 = (t + 2)(t^2 - 2t + 4)\n\\]\n\nThus, the numerator becomes:\n\\[\n(t + 2)(t^2 - 2t + 4)(t + 2) = (t + 2)^2(t^2 - 2t + 4)\n\\]\n\nDividing by the denominator \\((t + 2)^2\\), we get:\n\\[\nx = t^2 - 2t + 4\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back \\( t = \\sqrt{n} \\), we have:\n\\[\nx = (\\sqrt{n})^2 - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4 = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4\n\\]\n\nWe analyze the range of \\( x \\) for \\( 36 \\leq n \\leq 72 \\):\n- When \\( n = 36 \\), \\( \\sqrt{n} = 6 \\), so \\( x = 36 - 2 \\cdot 6 + 4 = 28 \\).\n- When \\( n = 72 \\), \\( \\sqrt{n} \\approx 8.485 \\), so \\( x \\approx 72 - 2 \\cdot 8.485 + 4 \\approx 59.03 \\).\n\nThe function \\( x = n - 2\\sqrt{n} + 4 \\) is increasing for \\( n \\geq 36 \\) because the derivative \\( \\frac{dx}{dn} = 1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}} \\) is positive for \\( n \\geq 1 \\). Thus, \\( x \\) ranges from 28 to approximately 59.03.\n\nEvaluating the options:\n- **Option C (25 < x < 64)** includes all values of \\( x \\) since 28 > 25 and 59.03 < 64.\n- Other options either exclude the minimum or maximum values.\n\nThus, the correct answer is **C**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",
