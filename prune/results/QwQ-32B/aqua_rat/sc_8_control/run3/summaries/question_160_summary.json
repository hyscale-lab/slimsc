      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased by 15%. I need to find the new selling price. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me denote the original price per article as P. Then the new price after a 15% decrease would be 85% of P, right? So the new price is 0.85 * P. Wait, but the question is asking for the new price, so maybe I should let the new price be N, then the original was N divided by 0.85? Because if the new is 85% of original, then original price was N / 0.85. That might be a better way to set variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set up equations based on the number of articles she could buy before and after. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me denote the original price as P. Then the number of articles she could buy originally for $300 would be 300 / P. After the price decrease, the new price is 0.85P, so she can buy 300 / (0.85P) articles. The problem states that this new number is 5 more than the original. So the equation would be:\n\n300/(0.85P) - 300/P = 5.\n\nHmm, that makes sense. Let me write that down properly. Let me check again. The difference between the new quantity and old quantity is 5. So yes, the equation is correct.\n\nNow I can solve this equation for P. Once I have P, the original price, then the new price is 0.85P, which is what the question wants.\n\nLet me work through the equation step by step. Let me rewrite the equation:\n\n(300)/(0.85P) - (300)/P = 5.\n\nTo solve for P, first, let's find a common denominator. The denominators are 0.85P and P. The common denominator would be 0.85P. So:\n\n[300 - 300*(0.85)] / (0.85P) = 5.\n\nWait, let's see: Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term is 300/(0.85P), second term is 300/P. Let me subtract the second term from the first:\n\n300/(0.85P) - 300/P = 5.\n\nLet me factor out 300/P:\n\n300/P [1/0.85 - 1] =5.\n\nYes, that might be a better approach. Let's see:\n\nTake 300/P times (1/0.85 - 1) equals 5.\n\nCalculating 1/0.85: 1 divided by 0.85 is approximately 1.17647. Subtract 1 gives 0.17647. So:\n\n300/P * 0.17647 =5.\n\nHmm, maybe better to do fractions exactly. Let me think. 0.85 is 17/20, so 1/0.85 is 20/17. So 20/17 minus 1 is (20-17)/17 = 3/17. So:\n\n300/P * (3/17) =5.\n\nAh, that's better. So:\n\n(300 * 3)/(17 P) =5.\n\nSo, 900/(17P) =5.\n\nThen, solving for P:\n\nMultiply both sides by 17P:\n\n900 =5*17P \u2192 900 =85P \u2192 P =900/85.\n\nCalculating that: 900 divided by 85. Let's see, 85*10 is 850, so 900-850 is 50, so 10 + 50/85. So 50/85 simplifies to 10/17, so P is 10 + 10/17 \u2248 10.5882 dollars. Wait, but that's the original price. Then the new price is 0.85 times that. Let me compute that:\n\n0.85 * (900/85). Wait, hold on, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since P is original price, and the new price is N =0.85P. So N = (0.85)*(900/85). Let me compute that. 0.85 is 17/20, so:\n\nN = (17/20)*(900/85) \u2192 Let's see, 900 divided by 85: 85*10 is 850, so 900 is 85*10 +50 \u2192 10.5882 as before. But perhaps simplifying fractions:\n\n17/20 * 900/85 = (17 * 900) / (20 *85).\n\nNotice that 17 and 85: 85 is 5*17, so 17 cancels with 85, leaving 5 in denominator. So:\n\n(900)/(20 *5) \u2192 900/(100) =9. Wait, that's interesting. Wait, let's do step by step:\n\n17 in numerator and 85 (which is 5\u00d717) in denominator \u2192 so 17 cancels with 85, leaving 5 in denominator. So the numerator is 900 and denominator is 20\u00d75=100. So 900/100 =9. So N=9?\n\nWait, but 9 isn't one of the options. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nHmm. Let me check the calculation again. Let's go back.\n\nOriginal equation: 300/(0.85P) - 300/P =5.\n\nLet me rewrite 0.85 as 17/20, so 0.85P = (17/20) P.\n\nSo the first term is 300 divided by (17/20 P) \u2192 that's 300 * (20)/(17 P) = (6000)/(17P).\n\nSecond term is 300/P. So the equation is:\n\n(6000/(17P)) - (300/P) =5.\n\nLet me combine the terms:\n\n[6000 - 300*17]/17P =5.\n\nWait, that's better. Let me compute numerator:\n\n300*17 is 5100. So 6000 -5100 =900.\n\nSo the equation becomes 900/(17P) =5 \u2192 17P= 900/5 \u2192 17P =180 \u2192 P =180/17 \u224810.5882. So original price is 180/17. Then new price N is 0.85 * P = (17/20)*(180/17) = (180)/20 =9. So that's 9. But the options given are 8,10,13.6,22.9,40. 9 isn't there. Hmm, so that must mean I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says that after the price decreased by 15%, she can buy 5 more articles for $300. So the equation should be (number after) minus (number before) equals 5.\n\nOriginal number: 300 / P.\n\nNew number: 300/(new price) \u2192 new price is P*(1 -0.15)=0.85P. So yes, that's correct. So the equation is correct. Hmm, but then the answer would be 9, which is not in the options. So perhaps I made an error in the setup?\n\nWait, maybe I inverted something. Let me check the question again. The price decreased by 15%, so the new price is 85% of the original. So the new price is 0.85 * original. So the original price is higher, so the number of articles she could buy before would be 300 / original price, and after it's 300/(0.85 original price). The difference is 5. So that part is correct. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an arithmetic mistake when simplifying fractions?\n\nWait, let's re-calculate N again. The new price N is 0.85P. Since P is 180/17, then N = 0.85*(180/17).\n\n0.85 is 17/20, so:\n\nN = (17/20)*(180/17) \u2192 the 17 cancels, so 180/(20) =9. Yes, that's correct. So the answer is 9? But the options don't have that. So that's a problem. Did I do the setup wrong?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question was that the price decreased by 15% of the new price? Wait, no, the question says \"the price of each article decreased by 15%\", which is a percentage of the original. Typically, percentage decreases are of the original value unless stated otherwise.\n\nHmm. Maybe the question is asking for the new price, which would be 9, but since it's not an option, perhaps I did something wrong. Let me try another approach.\n\nAlternative approach: Let me let the new price be N. Then the original price was N / 0.85, since the new price is 85% of the original. \n\nThen, the number of articles she could buy originally was 300/( (N /0.85) ) = 300 *0.85 / N. \n\nThe number she can buy now is 300/N. \n\nThe difference between new and original is 5, so:\n\n300/N - (300*0.85)/N =5.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n300/N - 255/N = (45)/N =5 \u2192 45/N =5 \u2192 N =45/5=9. \n\nSame result. Hmm, so the answer is 9, but that's not an option. Wait, the options are A)8, B)10, etc. So maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the question?\n\nWait, let me read again. \"Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%.\" So the price decreased, so she can buy more. The difference is 5. So the equation is correct. \n\nHmm. The options given don't have 9, but the closest is 8 or 10. Maybe I made an error in calculation steps?\n\nWait, let me try plugging in the options to see which one works. Let's see. Let me try option B)10. Suppose the new price is $10. Then the original price was 10 /0.85 \u2248 11.7647. \n\nOriginal number of articles: 300 /11.7647 \u224825.5 (Wait, but that's not an integer. Hmm. Wait 300 divided by 11.7647: 11.7647 *25 is 294.1175, so 25.5 would be 294.1175 + 5.8825 =300, so 25.5? That's possible, but fractional articles?)\n\nWait, but maybe the number of articles has to be integer. Hmm, but the problem doesn't specify that, so maybe fractions are okay in the calculation. \n\nSo with new price 10, she can buy 300/10 =30 articles. Original was 300/(11.7647) \u224825.5. The difference is 30-25.5=4.5. Not 5. So that's not 5. So B)10 is not correct.\n\nTry option A)8. New price 8. Original price would be 8 /0.85 \u22489.4118. \n\nOriginal number: 300/9.4118 \u224831.88. New number 300/8 =37.5. The difference is 37.5 -31.88\u22485.62. Not exactly 5. Hmm.\n\nOption C)13.6. Wait that's higher than 10, so if the new price is 13.6, then the original would be higher. So she would buy fewer articles. That can't be right. Since the price decreased, so the new price must be lower than original. So 13.6 is higher than 10, so maybe that's not. Wait, no, 13.6 is higher than 10 but lower than original? Let me check. Wait, new price is 13.6. Original price was 13.6 /0.85 =16. So original price was 16. Then original number:300/16=18.75. New number:300/13.6\u224822.05. The difference is ~3.3, which is not 5. So no.\n\nOption D)22.9. That's way higher. So original price would be even higher. Not possible. \n\nOption E)40: same issue. So none of these give a difference of 5 except maybe my calculation for 9. But 9 isn't an option. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the equation. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal price: P. New price:0.85P. \n\nNumber before: 300/P.\n\nNumber after:300/(0.85P). \n\nThe difference is 5: 300/(0.85P) - 300/P =5.\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is the other way around? Like, maybe the original number minus the new is 5? But that would not make sense because the price decreased, so she can buy more. So the new number should be higher. So the equation is correct as written.\n\nHmm. Maybe the problem is in the percentage. Did I calculate the new price correctly?\n\nWait, maybe the problem says the price decreased by 15%, so the new price is original price minus 15% of original. So yes, that's 0.85P. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the question's wording: \"buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased by 15%\". So maybe the total cost is $300, so the price per article decreased, allowing her to buy 5 more than before. So the equations are correct. \n\nHmm. Since the calculated answer is 9, but it's not among the options, perhaps I made an error in the algebra?\n\nLet me go back through the equations again.\n\nEquation:\n\n300/(0.85P) - 300/P =5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P * P to eliminate denominators:\n\n300P - 300*0.85P =5 *0.85 P\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait, the common denominator would be 0.85P * P. Let me do that step again.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85 P\u00b2:\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to find the common denominator. Let me rewrite the equation:\n\nLet me denote 0.85 as a fraction. Let me use fractions for precision.\n\n0.85 = 17/20, so 1/0.85 =20/17.\n\nSo the equation becomes:\n\n300*(20)/(17P) - 300/P =5.\n\nLet me factor out 300/P:\n\n300/P [20/17 -1] =5.\n\n20/17 -1 is 3/17. So:\n\n300/P * 3/17 =5 \u2192 (900)/(17P)=5 \u2192 17P=900/5 \u2192 17P=180 \u2192 P=180/17 \u224810.588.\n\nNew price N is 0.85*P = (17/20)*(180/17)= (180/20)=9. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Since the answer isn't there, perhaps there's a miscalculation. Let me check if the question said \"15% of the new price\" instead of original. Wait, no, the question says \"price of each article decreased by 15%\", which is standard to mean 15% of original.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant that the price was reduced to 15% of the original? No, that would be a drastic decrease, but then the new price would be 0.15 P, but that would give a much higher number of articles. Let me see: if new price was 0.15 P, then:\n\nEquation would be 300/(0.15P) -300/P =5 \u2192 2000/P -300/P= 1700/P=5 \u2192 P=340. New price would be 51. Not in options.\n\nNo, that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have the equation reversed? Let me think. If the new price is lower, then the number of articles should be higher. So the new number minus old number is +5. So the equation is correct.\n\nHmm. The options given must have an error, or perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Wait, the question says \"buy 5 more articles for $300\". So the total amount she spends is $300 in both cases? Wait no, the problem says after the price decrease, she can buy 5 more articles for the same $300. So yes, the $300 is the same in both cases. So the equations are correct.\n\nWait, maybe the question is in another way. Let me think again. Suppose originally she could buy x articles for $300, so price per article is 300/x. After the price decrease, the new price is 0.85*(300/x), and now she can buy x+5 articles for the same $300. So the new price is 300/(x+5). \n\nSo setting the new price equal to 0.85*(original price):\n\n300/(x+5) =0.85*(300/x).\n\nYes, this is another way to set it up, perhaps better. Let me try this approach.\n\nLet me define x as the original number of articles. Then original price per article is 300/x. The new price is 0.85*(300/x). But she can buy x+5 articles for $300, so new price is also 300/(x+5). Therefore:\n\n300/(x+5) =0.85*(300/x).\n\nDivide both sides by 300:\n\n1/(x+5) =0.85/x \u2192 cross multiply:\n\nx =0.85(x+5).\n\nx =0.85x +4.25 \u2192 x -0.85x =4.25 \u21920.15x=4.25 \u2192x=4.25 /0.15 \u224828.333...\n\nHmm, but x is the original number of articles. So original number was 28.333, new number is 33.333. The difference is 5, which matches. Then the new price is 300/(33.333) =9. So same result. So that's the same answer. So the new price is $9, but that's not in the options. \n\nWait, but the options given are A)8, B)10, etc. So perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Wait, let me check with this method again.\n\nx = original number of articles. Then new number is x +5. \n\nOriginal price per article: 300/x.\n\nNew price:0.85*(300/x) = (300*0.85)/x =255/x.\n\nBut new price is also 300/(x+5). So:\n\n255/x = 300/(x+5).\n\nCross multiply: 255(x+5)=300x \u2192255x +1275 =300x \u2192 45x=1275 \u2192x=1275/45 =28.333...\n\nThen new price is 300/(x+5)=300/(28.333+5)=300/33.333\u22489. So yes, same result.\n\nHmm. So this must mean that there's an error in the problem's options, or perhaps I misunderstood the question. Alternatively, maybe the price decrease is 15% of the new price? Let me try that approach.\n\nSuppose the price decreased by 15% of the new price. Let the new price be N. Then the original price was N +0.15N =1.15N. Then the original price is 1.15N. \n\nOriginal number of articles:300/(1.15N).\n\nNew number:300/N.\n\nThe difference is 5 \u2192 300/N -300/(1.15N)=5.\n\nFactor out 300/N:\n\n300/N (1 -1/1.15)=5.\n\nCompute 1 -1/1.15: 1/1.15 is approx 0.8696, so 1-0.8696=0.1304. So:\n\n300/N *0.1304=5 \u2192 300*0.1304 /5 =N \u2192 39.12/5 \u22487.824. So N\u22487.82. Not an option either. \n\nHmm. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question meant that the total price decreased by 15%? But that's not what it says. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me check again:\n\nOriginal approach with variables:\n\nOriginal price P. New price 0.85P. \n\nEquation: 300/(0.85P) -300/P =5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P:\n\n300 - 300*0.85 =5*(0.85P).\n\nCompute left side: 300*(1-0.85) =300*0.15=45.\n\nSo 45 =4.25P \u2192 P=45/4.25 \u224810.588.\n\nWait, wait, hold on! Wait, when I multiplied both sides by 0.85P, let me redo that step:\n\nLeft side: [300/(0.85P) -300/P] *0.85P \u2192 300/(0.85P)*0.85P =300, and the second term is -300/P *0.85P =-300*0.85. So total left side is 300 -300*(0.85) =300*(1-0.85)=300*0.15=45. \n\nRight side:5*(0.85P). \n\nSo equation is 45 =4.25 P \u2192 P=45/4.25. Let me compute that. \n\n45 divided by 4.25. 4.25 is 17/4. So 45 divided by (17/4) is 45*(4/17)= 180/17 \u224810.588. So that's correct. \n\nThen new price is 0.85 * (180/17). Let me compute 0.85*(180/17):\n\n0.85 is 17/20, so (17/20)*(180/17)= (180)/20 =9. \n\nSo the math is correct. \n\nHmm. The options given don't have 9. That's confusing. Let me check the options again:\n\nA) $8, B)10, C)13.6, D)22.9, E)40.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the options. Let me check again. The user input says:\n\nOptions:\n\nA)$8\n\nB)$10\n\nC)$13.6\n\nD)$22.9\n\nE)$40\n\nHmm. So none of them is 9. So what's going on here?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the question's interpretation. Let me read again: \"buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%\". \n\nWait, maybe the total cost is $300 after the price decrease, allowing her to buy 5 more than she could before with the same amount. Wait, but that's what I already considered. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the $300 is the total she spent before and after? Like, before she spent $300 and bought x articles, and after the price decrease, she still spends $300 but gets x+5. Which is exactly what I did. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is in another way. Like, she can buy 5 more articles for $300, so the cost of 5 articles at the new price is $300? No, that would be different. \n\nWait, the problem says \"buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased\". So the total amount is $300, and she can buy 5 more than before. So yes, the setup is correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question had a different percentage? Like 10% instead of 15%? Let me see. If it were 10%, then let's try that. \n\nSuppose the price decreased by 10%, so new price is 0.9P. \n\nEquation: 300/(0.9P) -300/P =5.\n\nMultiply through:\n\n300/(0.9P) -300/P =5 \u2192 300/(0.9P) -300/P = (300 - 300*0.9)/0.9P = (300*0.1)/0.9P =30/(0.9P) =5 \u2192 30/(0.9P)=5 \u21920.9P=6 \u2192 P=6/0.9=6.666\u2026 \n\nNew price is 0.9*6.666\u2026=6. So that would be 6, which is not in the options. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe 20% decrease? Let me try 20%.\n\nNew price 0.8P.\n\nEquation: 300/(0.8P) -300/P =5 \u2192 300/(0.8P) -300/P = (300 - 300*0.8)/0.8P \u2192 (300*0.2)/0.8P \u219260/(0.8P)=5 \u219260/(0.8P)=5 \u21920.8P=12 \u2192 P=15. New price 12. So new price is 12, which is not an option either. \n\nHmm. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a different total amount? Like $350? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the original price? But that would be approx 10.58, which is close to option B)10. But the question asks for the new price. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in calculation when I thought 0.85P is the new price. Let me check again: the problem states that the price decreased by 15%, so new price is original minus 15% of original. So yes, 0.85*original. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question had a typo and the answer should be 10. Let me see what happens if the new price is 10. \n\nIf new price is $10, then original price was 10 /0.85 \u224811.7647.\n\nOriginal number:300/11.7647 \u224825.5.\n\nNew number:300/10=30. The difference is 4.5, which is not 5. Close, but not exact. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is $8? Let me check:\n\nNew price 8. Original price 8 /0.85 \u22489.4118.\n\nOriginal number:300/9.4118\u224831.88. New number 37.5. Difference is ~5.62. \n\nHmm, that's closer to 5.62. Not 5. \n\nWait, maybe the question says 5 more articles per dollar? No, that would change things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the price decreased by 15%, so the quantity increased by 1/0.85, which is 17/12.5? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from an older source and the options have a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I have a miscalculation. \n\nWait, let me check the options again. Option C is 13.6. Let me see what happens if new price is 13.6. \n\nOriginal price would be 13.6 /0.85 =16. \n\nOriginal number of articles:300/16 =18.75. \n\nNew number:300/13.6\u224822.05. \n\nDifference is ~3.3. Not 5. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant that the price increased by 15%? Then the new price would be higher, so she can buy fewer articles, but the problem says she can buy more, so that's not possible. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. The math clearly gives 9, but that's not an option. Maybe I misread the question? Let me read again:\n\n\"Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?\"\n\nWait, perhaps the question meant that the price decreased to 15% of the original? That would mean new price is 0.15P. Then:\n\nEquation:300/(0.15P) -300/P =5 \u2192 2000/P -300/P = 1700/P =5 \u2192 P=340. \n\nNew price is 0.15*340=51. Not an option. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question's 15% decrease is per some other unit? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the question's numbers? Like, 5 more articles for $300, but maybe the total money is different? For example, maybe $350? Let me see what happens if the total is $350. \n\nWait, but the question says $300. \n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 10, and the question expects rounding? Let me see. \n\nThe exact value is 9. So the closest option is 8 or 10. Since 9 is closer to 10 than 8, perhaps they rounded up. But then the difference would be 4.5, which is not 5. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem's options. But since this is a multiple-choice question, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me assume the new price is 10 (option B). \n\nOriginal price was 10 /0.85 \u224811.7647. \n\nNumber before:300/11.7647\u224825.5. \n\nAfter:300/10=30. \n\nDifference:4.5. \n\nHmm. \n\nIf the answer is 8 (option A), difference is ~5.62. \n\nThe problem states \"5 more\", so the exact difference is 5. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question allows for approximate answers? \n\nWait, let's see what would give exactly 5. \n\nSuppose the new price N must satisfy:\n\n300/N -300/(N/0.85) =5. \n\nWait, let me re-express the equation in terms of N. \n\nLet N be the new price. Original price was N /0.85. \n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n300/N - 300/(N/0.85) =5 \u2192 300/N - 300*(0.85)/N =5 \u2192 300*(1 -0.85)/N =5 \u2192 300*(0.15)/N =5 \u2192 45/N=5 \u2192 N=9. \n\nSo the exact answer is 9. Since that's not an option, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem. But since this is a test question, maybe I missed something. \n\nWait, maybe the question says \"decreased by 15%\", which is a 15% decrease from the new price? That is, the new price is original minus 15% of the new price? Let me see. \n\nLet me denote new price as N. Then the original price was N +0.15N =1.15N. \n\nThen the equation would be:\n\n300/N -300/(1.15N) =5 \u2192 300*(1 -1/1.15)/N =5 \u2192 compute 1-1/1.15 = (0.15)/1.15 \u22480.1304. \n\nSo 300 *0.1304 /N =5 \u2192 39.12/N =5 \u2192 N=39.12/5\u22487.824. Not an option. \n\nHmm. Not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is saying that the total amount decreased by 15%? No, the wording is clear: price per article decreased by 15%. \n\nHmm. I'm at a loss. The calculation leads to $9, which is not listed. But perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Let me try to think differently. \n\nSuppose the number of articles she can buy is inversely proportional to the price. \n\nLet me let the original number be x, new number is x+5. \n\nThe price ratio is original/new =1/0.85. \n\nSince price and quantity are inversely proportional, the ratio of quantities is new/original =0.85/1. \n\nWait, the price decreased by 15%, so the new price is 0.85 of original. So the quantity she can buy is 1/0.85 times the original quantity. \n\nSo (x+5)/x =1/0.85 \u21921.17647 =x+5/x \u2192 cross multiply \u2192 (x+5)=1.17647x \u21925=0.17647x \u2192x\u224828.333. \n\nThen new quantity is 33.333. \n\nThus new price is 300/33.333=9. So again, same result. \n\nHmm. I think the problem's options must be incorrect. But since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe I should look for the closest option. Since 9 is between 8 and 10, but the options don't have it, perhaps there's an error in the question's numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the price decrease is 15% of the original. Wait, perhaps it's 15% of the new price? Let me try that. \n\nLet me let the new price be N. Then the decrease is 15% of N, so original price was N +0.15N =1.15N. \n\nThen the equation: \n\n300/N -300/(1.15N) =5 \u2192 same as before, leading to N\u22487.82, which is not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants the original price? But that was approximately $10.588, which is closest to $10.59, so option B)10 is the closest, but that would be the original price. But the question asks for new price. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I misread the question. Let me read again: \n\n\"Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?\" \n\nAh! Wait a second! Maybe the question says that the price decreased by 15 dollars? Like, a flat $15 decrease? That would change everything. \n\nWait, the question says \"decreased by 15%\", so that's a percentage, not dollars. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in another currency where decimal points are commas, but that's unlikely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question had a different number of articles. Like, 5 more for $350? \n\nWait, but I have to work with the given info. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the equation setup. Let me try another way. \n\nLet me suppose the new price is N. \n\nOriginal price is N/(0.85). \n\nNumber of articles before:300/(N/0.85)= 300*0.85/N=255/N. \n\nNumber after:300/N. \n\nThe difference is 300/N -255/N=45/N=5 \u219245/N=5 \u2192N=9. \n\nSo again, same result. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think the problem's options might have a mistake. Since the calculated answer is 9, which is not listed. But maybe I made a mistake in calculation steps. \n\nWait, let me check the first equation again. \n\n300/(0.85P) -300/P =5. \n\nLet me plug in the answer as 10 (option B) and see what happens. \n\nIf new price is 10, then original price was 10/0.85 \u224811.7647. \n\nOriginal number of articles:300/11.7647\u224825.5. \n\nNew number:300/10=30. \n\nDifference:30-25.5=4.5. Not 5. \n\nIf the new price is 8 (option A), then original price is 8/0.85\u22489.4118. \n\nOriginal number:300/9.4118\u224831.88. \n\nNew number:300/8=37.5. \n\nDifference:37.5-31.88\u22485.62. \n\nHmm. The question says \"5 more articles\", so the difference must be exactly 5. \n\nThe only way this happens is with N=9. \n\nSo since 9 isn't an option, perhaps there is an error in the problem. But since I have to choose from the options given, maybe the closest is 10? Or perhaps I made a mistake. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the price decrease is 15% of original. Let me try using another method where I let the new price be N and original price be N +0.15*N =1.15N. Wait, no, that's if the increase. Wait, if the price decreased by 15%, then original price is higher. \n\nWait, the new price is 85% of original. So original price is N /0.85. \n\nSo the difference in articles is 300/N -300/(N/0.85) =5 \u2192300/N -300*0.85/N = (300-255)/N =45/N=5 \u2192 N=9. \n\nThus, I think the correct answer is 9, but it's not listed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question had a different percentage, like 10% decrease? Let's see. \n\nIf the decrease was 10%, then:\n\nEquation:300/(0.9P) -300/P =5 \u2192 (300/0.9P -300/P)=5 \u2192300(1/0.9 -1)/P=5 \u2192300*(0.1/0.9)/P =5 \u2192300*0.1111/P =5 \u219233.333/P=5 \u2192 P=6.666. \n\nNew price is 0.9*6.666=6. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is from an older version where the options had a 9, but now it's mistyped. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct but I misread the options. Let me check again:\n\nOptions:\n\nA) $8\n\nB) $10\n\nC)$13.6\n\nD)$22.9\n\nE)$40\n\nNo, there's no 9. \n\nHmm. Maybe the question is in another way. Let me think differently. \n\nSuppose the new price is N. \n\nThe number of articles bought at new price:300/N.\n\nThe number of articles bought at original price:300/(N/(0.85)) =255/N.\n\nThe difference is 5: 300/N -255/N=45/N=5 \u2192 N=9. \n\nThus, I think the answer must be 9. But it's not present, so perhaps there's a mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question said that the price increased by 15%, but that would reduce the number of articles. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the sign. Let me see:\n\nIf the equation were 300/P -300/(0.85P)=5, then:\n\n300/P (1-0.85/1) \u2192 no. Wait, that would be original minus new. \n\nWait, if I set up the equation as original number minus new number =-5 (since new is higher), then 300/P -300/(0.85P)= -5 \u2192 same as before. \n\nSo the equation is correct. \n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Since the calculated answer isn't among the options, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem's understanding. \n\nWait, the question says \"buy 5 more articles for $300\". So the total cost for the new quantity is still $300. So yes, the setup is correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is C)13.6? Let me see. \n\nIf new price is 13.6, then original price is 13.6/0.85=16. \n\nOriginal articles:300/16=18.75. \n\nNew articles:300/13.6\u224822.05. \n\nDifference is ~3.3. Not 5. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant that the price decreased by 15 dollars? Let me see. \n\nIf original price was P, new price is P-15. \n\nEquation:300/(P-15) -300/P =5. \n\nLet me solve this equation. \n\nMultiply both sides by P(P-15):\n\n300P -300(P-15) =5P(P-15).\n\n300P -300P +4500 =5P\u00b2 -75P.\n\n4500 =5P\u00b2 -75P \u21925P\u00b2 -75P -4500=0 \u2192 divide by 5: P\u00b2 -15P -900=0.\n\nSolve quadratic equation: P = [15 \u00b1\u221a(225 +3600)]/2 \u2192 \u221a3825\u224861.85 \u2192 (15+61.85)/2\u224838.42. \n\nNew price would be 38.42-15=23.42, which is not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant a 15% decrease in total cost, but that's not clear. \n\nHmm. I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is 9, but since it's not listed, there must be an error. However, looking back at the options, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me check once again. \n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the equation setup. \n\nLet me try with the new price N. \n\nThe number of articles she can buy now is 300/N. \n\nOriginally, it was 300/(N /0.85) = 300*0.85/N =255/N. \n\nThe difference is 300/N -255/N=45/N=5 \u2192 N=45/5=9. \n\nYes. So that's correct. \n\nHmm. Maybe the options have a typo and option C is 13.6, which is 9*1.51? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant that the price decreased to 15% of the original, but that would give new price of 0.15P, so:\n\nEquation:300/(0.15P) -300/P =5 \u2192 2000/P -300/P=1700/P=5 \u2192 P=340. \n\nNew price is 0.15*340=51. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a 50% decrease? Let's see. \n\nIf price decreased by 50%, new price is 0.5P. \n\nEquation:300/(0.5P) -300/P =5 \u2192600/P -300/P=300/P=5 \u2192 P=60. \n\nNew price 30. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that the total amount she spends is $300 more? Like, she buys 5 more articles for an additional $300? That would change the problem. \n\nWait, the question says \"buy 5 more articles for $300\". So the total is still $300. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question says the price decreased by 15 articles? No, that doesn't make sense. \n\nHmm. \n\nSince I can't find any mistake in the calculations, and the correct answer isn't listed, perhaps the closest answer is B)10, but that gives a difference of 4.5, which is close to 5. Or perhaps the question had a different value. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct and I made a mistake in calculation. Let me try with option C)13.6. \n\nIf new price is 13.6, then original price is 13.6 /0.85 =16. \n\nOriginal number:300/16=18.75 \n\nNew number:300/13.6\u224822.05 \n\nDifference of ~3.3. Not 5. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the original price? Which is 180/17 \u224810.588, so closest is 10.59, so option B)10. But the question asks for new price. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is from an SAT or similar where sometimes approximate answers are given. The options are 8, 10, 13.6, etc. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation. Let me try to plug in option C)13.6. \n\nLet me see: \n\nIf new price is 13.6, then original price is 13.6 /0.85 =16. \n\nOriginal number:300/16 =18.75 \n\nNew number:300/13.6 \u224822.05 \n\nDifference is 3.3. Not 5. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the percentage calculation. Let me try with the new price as 13.6. \n\n13.6 is the new price. Original price is higher. \n\n13.6 is 85% of original, so original is 13.6 /0.85=16. \n\nYes. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question wants the original price? Then it's 16. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question had a different number of articles. Like 6 more articles? \n\nLet me see: \n\nIf difference is 6: \n\n45/N=6 \u2192 N=7.5. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a different total amount. Like $360? \n\nLet me try with $360. \n\nEquation:360/N -360/(N/0.85)=5 \u2192 360/N -360*0.85/N =360*(0.15)/N =54/N =5 \u2192N=54/5=10.8. \n\nClose to 10.8. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think the only conclusion is that the correct answer is 9, which is not listed. Since this is a multiple-choice question and I have to choose from the given options, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's options, or I made a mistake in the setup. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in thinking that the equation is new - original =5. Perhaps it's original - new =-5? But that would give the same equation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants the price in cents? Like, 900 cents? No, that's 9 dollars. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should choose option C)13.6 because 13.6 is 0.85 of 16, which would be the original price if new is 13.6. But that's not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the first step. Let me try solving the equation again. \n\nEquation: \n\n300/(0.85P) - 300/P =5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 0.85P: \n\n300 -300*0.85 =5 *0.85P.\n\nLeft side:300*(1-0.85)=300*0.15=45.\n\nRight side:4.25 P.\n\nThus 45=4.25P \u2192 P=45/4.25.\n\nCalculating 45 divided by 4.25:\n\n4.25 \u00d7 10 =42.5 \u2192 45-42.5=2.5 \u2192 2.5/4.25 = (2.5*4)/17 =10/17\u22480.5882. \n\nSo P=10 +0.5882 \u224810.5882. \n\nNew price is 0.85 \u00d710.5882 \u22488.99995 \u22489. \n\nSo the calculation is correct. \n\nHmm. Since this is a test question and the options don't have 9, I think there's either a mistake in the problem or perhaps I missed something. \n\nWait, maybe the question says \"increased by 15%\"? Let me try that. \n\nIf the price increased by 15%, then new price is 1.15P. \n\nThen the equation would be:\n\n300/(1.15P) -300/P =-5 (since she can buy fewer articles). \n\nBut the question says she can buy more, so that's not the case. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is in reverse: the new price is 15% of the original? \n\nThen new price is 0.15P. \n\nEquation:300/(0.15P) -300/P =5 \u21922000/P -300/P =1700/P =5 \u2192P=340. New price 51. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to conclude that the answer should be 9, but since it's not an option, there's an error. However, perhaps I made a mistake and the correct answer is B)10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's interpretation. Let me try one last time. \n\nIf the new price is N, then original price is N /0.85. \n\nThe number of articles she can buy now is 300/N. \n\nPreviously, she could buy 300/(N/0.85) = (300\u00d70.85)/N =255/N. \n\nThe difference is 300/N -255/N =45/N =5 \u2192 N=9. \n\nThus, the correct answer is 9, which is not listed. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the problem had a different percentage, like 20% decrease? \n\nLet me try with 20% decrease (new price is 0.8P). \n\nEquation:300/(0.8P) -300/P =5 \u2192300/(0.8P) -300/P = (300 -240)/0.8P =60/(0.8P)=5 \u219260/(0.8P)=5 \u21920.8P=12 \u2192P=15. \n\nNew price is 12. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, 25% decrease? \n\nNew price 0.75P. \n\nEquation:300/(0.75P) -300/P =5 \u2192300/(0.75P) -300/P = (300 -225)/0.75P =75/(0.75P)=100/P =5 \u2192P=20. \n\nNew price 15. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nI'm really stuck. The only possible conclusion is that there's an error in the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, maybe I made a mistake. \n\nWait, let me check the problem one more time. \n\n\"Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%.\" \n\nAh! Wait a second! Maybe \"buy 5 more articles for $300\" means that she spends $300 more to buy 5 more articles? Like, the total cost increased by $300, allowing her to buy 5 more? \n\nIf that's the case, the setup would be different. \n\nLet me try that. \n\nLet me denote the original price as P. \n\nOriginal number of articles: let's say she bought x articles for some amount, but the problem states she uses $300. \n\nWait, the problem says \"buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decreased by 15%\". \n\nHmm. The wording is ambiguous. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps she bought some number of articles originally with less money, and now with $300 she can buy 5 more. But the problem states \"for $300\", implying that $300 is the total spent in both cases. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to go with the calculations, even though the answer isn't listed. But since this is a multiple-choice question, maybe I made a mistake in the setup. \n\nWait, maybe the question is saying that after the price decrease, she can buy 5 more articles than she could before when spending $300. So the difference is 5. \n\nThat's exactly what I did. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe options don't have the correct answer, so perhaps the closest is B)10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a 25% decrease, giving new price of 15, which isn't listed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a different original price. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the percentage calculation. \n\nWait, the price decreased by 15%, so the new price is 85% of original. \n\nYes. \n\nHmm. \n\nWell, I think the correct answer is 9, which is not listed. But since I have to choose from the options given, perhaps there's an error and the closest is B)10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me try one more time. \n\nLet me let the new price be N. \n\nThe number of articles she can buy now is 300/N. \n\nOriginally, she could buy 300/(N/0.85) = 255/N. \n\nThe difference is 300/N -255/N =45/N =5 \u2192 N=9. \n\nSo the answer is 9, but it's not there. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps the options are wrong, but since I have to choose from them, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question said \"buy 5 times more articles\", which would be different. But no. \n\nHmm. \n\nWell, I'm going to go with the calculation that the answer should be 9. Since it's not an option, maybe the correct answer is B)10 due to rounding. \n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is correct and I missed something. \n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the original price? \n\nThen original price is 10.588, which is closest to 10.59, so option B)10. But the question asks for new price. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to conclude that the correct answer is not listed, but since I must choose from the options, perhaps there's a mistake and the answer is B)10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation steps. \n\nWait, let me compute 17/20 * 180/17 again. \n\n17 cancels, so 180/20 =9. So correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nWell, I'll have to go with the calculated answer of 9, which isn't there. But since I must choose from the options, perhaps the correct answer is not listed. But since the options are given, maybe I made a mistake in the problem's reading. \n\nWait, the question says \"the price of each article decreased by 15%\", so new price is 85% of original. \n\nOriginal price: P. \n\nNew price:0.85P. \n\nNumber of articles before:300/P. \n\nAfter:300/(0.85P). \n\nThe difference is 5. \n\nEquation:300/(0.85P) -300/P =5 \u2192 multiply both sides by 0.85P \u2192 300 - 300*0.85 =5*0.85P \u2192 300*0.15 =4.25P \u219245=4.25P \u2192 P=10.588. \n\nNew price:0.85*10.588\u22489. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'll have to go with the answer that's closest, which is option B)10, even though it's not exact. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a different value for the total money. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct and the answer is option C)13.6. \n\nWait, let's see if there's a different interpretation. \n\nSuppose the price decreased by 15% of the new price. Let me try that. \n\nLet new price be N. \n\nThe decrease is 0.15N. \n\nOriginal price is N +0.15N =1.15N. \n\nEquation:300/N -300/(1.15N)=5 \u2192300/N (1-1/1.15)=5 \u2192300/N*(0.15/1.15)=5 \u2192 (300*0.15)/(1.15*N)=5 \u219245/(1.15*N)=5 \u2192N=45/(5*1.15)=45/5.75\u22487.824. \n\nNot an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the original price? 10.588 is closest to 10.59, so option B)10. \n\nBut the question asks for new price. \n\nHmm. \n\nSince there's no other way, I think the correct answer is 9, which is not listed. But since I must choose from the options, I'll have to select the closest possible, but I'm not sure. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me try another approach. \n\nLet me let the original price be P. \n\nOriginal quantity: Q =300/P. \n\nNew quantity: Q+5 =300/(0.85P). \n\nSo:\n\nQ+5 =300/(0.85P).\n\nBut Q =300/P. \n\nSubstitute:\n\n300/P +5 =300/(0.85P). \n\nMultiply both sides by P:\n\n300 +5P =300/0.85.\n\nCompute 300/0.85 \u2248352.941. \n\nThus:\n\n300 +5P \u2248352.941 \u21925P\u224852.941 \u2192P\u224810.588. \n\nNew price is 0.85*10.588\u22489. \n\nSame result. \n\nHmm. \n\nSince the problem is from a multiple-choice question, and the answer isn't there, I think there must be an error in the options. But since I have to choose from the given options, perhaps the correct answer is B)10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a different percentage. For example, 10% decrease would give N=6, which is not listed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question said 5 more articles for $350. Let me see: \n\nEquation with $350:\n\n350/N -350/(N/0.85)=5 \u2192350/N -297.62/N=52.38/N=5 \u2192N=10.476. \n\nClose to 10.5. \n\nHmm. \n\nWell, I think the best I can do is choose option B)10 as the closest possible, even though the correct calculation is 9. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question had a different value. \n\nWait, perhaps the difference is 5 articles per $300, so the price per article is 300 divided by the number of articles. \n\nWait, maybe the question is saying that she can buy 5 more articles for an additional $300. That would be different. \n\nFor example, originally she could buy x articles for some amount, and with $300 more, she can buy x+5 articles at the new price. \n\nBut the question says \"buy 5 more articles for $300\", which implies that $300 is the total. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to go with the answer I calculated and say that there's an error in the options. But since I must choose, perhaps the answer is B)10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is correct and I made a mistake. \n\nWait, if I take option C)13.6 as the new price: \n\nOriginal price is 13.6/0.85 =16. \n\nOriginal quantity:300/16=18.75 \n\nNew quantity:300/13.6\u224822.05 \n\nDifference is 3.3. Not 5. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question had a different percentage. \n\nIf the price decreased by 20%, then new price is 0.8P. \n\nEquation:300/(0.8P) -300/P =5 \u2192 (300/0.8 -300)/P =5 \u2192 (375-300)/P =5 \u219275/P =5 \u2192 P=15. \n\nNew price is 12. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the price decreased by 25%, new price 0.75P. \n\nEquation:300/(0.75P) -300/P = (400 -300)/P =100/P =5 \u2192P=20. \n\nNew price 15. Not an option. \n\nHmm. \n\nI'm really stuck. I think the correct answer is 9, but since it's not listed, I'll have to choose the closest option, which is B)10. \n\nWait, the difference with option B is 4.5, which is close to 5. Maybe the question allows for approximate answers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem uses simple interest or something else. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I'll have to go with B)10 as the closest option, even though it's not exact. \n\nBut wait, the options include C)13.6. Let me see what happens if the new price is 13.6. \n\n13.6 is the new price. \n\nOriginal price:13.6 /0.85 =16. \n\nOriginal number:300/16 =18.75 \n\nNew number:300/13.6\u224822.05 \n\nThe difference is 3.3, which is not 5. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question meant that the price increased by 15%? \n\nThen new price is 1.15P. \n\nEquation:300/(1.15P) -300/P =-5 \u2192 \n\n-5 =300(1/1.15 -1)/P \u2192 \n\n-5 =300*(-0.15/1.15)/P \u2192 \n\nMultiply both sides by P: \n\n-5P = -43.478 \u2192 P=8.695. \n\nNew price is 1.15\u00d78.695\u224810. \n\nAh! Here we go. If the price had increased by 15%, then the new price would be about 10, and the difference would be negative, but the question states she can buy more, so that's not the case. \n\nWait, but if the price increased, she would buy fewer articles, so the equation would be negative difference. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me try this scenario where the price increased by 15%, just for fun. \n\nIf price increased by 15%, new price is 1.15P. \n\nNumber of articles now:300/(1.15P). \n\nOriginal:300/P. \n\nThe difference is 300/(1.15P) -300/P = negative. \n\nTo get a positive difference of 5, the price must have decreased. \n\nHmm. \n\nWell, I think I have to conclude that the correct answer is not listed, but since I must choose from the options, I'll go with B)10, assuming a rounding error. \n\nAlternatively, the question might have a different setup. \n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking for the original price? Which is 10.59, closest to 10.59 is option B)10. But the question asks for new price. \n\nHmm. \n\nIn that case, I think there's an error in the question's options. But since I must choose from the given options, I'll have to go with B)10 as the closest possible. \n\nWait, but the difference with B)10 is 4.5 articles. The question says 5. That's a difference of 0.5 articles. Maybe that's close enough. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is correct and I made a mistake. \n\nWait, let me try plugging in option C)13.6. \n\nNew price:13.6. \n\nOriginal price:13.6/0.85 =16. \n\nNumber of articles before:300/16 =18.75. \n\nAfter:300/13.6\u224822.05. \n\nThe difference is 3.3. Not 5. \n\nHmm. \n\nWell, I think I have to go with B)10 as the answer, even though the calculation doesn't fit exactly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the difference for option B)10:\n\nNew price is $10. \n\nOriginal price:10 /0.85 \u224811.7647. \n\nNumber before:300 /11.7647 \u224825.5 articles. \n\nNumber after:300/10=30. \n\nDifference is 4.5. \n\nHmm. \n\nThe problem states she can buy 5 more articles, so this is close but not exact. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question uses approximate values. \n\nIf the new price is $10, then the difference is 4.5, which is close to 5. \n\nMaybe the question expects us to round to the nearest whole number. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in the question's numbers. \n\nGiven that, I think the intended answer might be B)10, so I'll go with that. \n\n**Final Answer**\nAnswer: B\n\n\nAnna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. To find the new selling price of each article, we start by setting up the equations based on the given information.\n\nLet \\( P \\) be the original price per article. The new price after a 15% decrease is \\( 0.85P \\). The number of articles Anna could buy originally for $300 is \\( \\frac{300}{P} \\), and the number of articles she can buy now is \\( \\frac{300}{0.85P} \\). The difference between these quantities is 5 articles:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{0.85P} - \\frac{300}{P} = 5\n\\]\n\nTo solve this equation, we first find a common denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{0.85P} - \\frac{300}{P} = \\frac{300}{P} \\left( \\frac{1}{0.85} - 1 \\right) = 5\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the terms inside the parentheses:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{0.85} - 1 = \\frac{1 - 0.85}{0.85} = \\frac{0.15}{0.85} = \\frac{3}{17}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting back into the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{300}{P} \\cdot \\frac{3}{17} = 5\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( P \\):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{900}{17P} = 5 \\implies 17P = \\frac{900}{5} \\implies 17P = 180 \\implies P = \\frac{180}{17} \\approx 10.588\n\\]\n\nThe new price is \\( 0.85P \\):\n\n\\[\n0.85 \\times \\frac{180}{17} = \\frac{17}{20} \\times \\frac{180}{17} = \\frac{180}{20} = 9\n\\]\n\nHowever, 9 is not among the given options. Checking the closest options, we consider the original price calculation and potential rounding. The closest option to the calculated new price of 9 is $10, which results in a difference of 4.5 articles, close to the required 5. Given the options provided, the closest and most reasonable choice is:\n\n\\boxed{B}",
