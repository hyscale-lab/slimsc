      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I have to figure out this multiplication table problem. The question gives me a multiplication setup where MAD multiplied by BE equals AMID. The options are different numbers for the letters A, M, I, D. Hmm, right, each letter represents a unique digit, right? So the multiplication is like a cryptarithmetic puzzle. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, let me write down the problem as given:\n\n   M A D\nx    B E\n----------\n   M A D      (this is the first partial product, from E multiplied by MAD)\nR A E         (this is the second partial product, from B multiplied by MAD, shifted one position to the left)\n----------\nA M I D       (the final product)\n\nThe options are the values of A, M, I, D in order. The options are like A) 9 2 0 0, so A is 9, M is 2, I is 0, D is 0? Wait, but digits must be unique? Or maybe not? Wait, the problem doesn't explicitly state that each letter must represent a unique digit, but in standard cryptarithmetic puzzles, each letter usually stands for a unique digit. So I should assume uniqueness unless stated otherwise.\n\nSo first, let's note the structure:\n\nMultiplying a 3-digit number (MAD) by a 2-digit number (BE) gives a 4-digit number (AMID). So the product is 4 digits, which tells me that the original numbers can't be too big. Let's see:\n\nThe maximum possible product would be if MAD is 999 and BE is 99, which would be 999*99=98901, which is a 5-digit number. But since the product here is a 4-digit number, that suggests that either MAD is a number in the lower range, or BE is a smaller two-digit number. Let me think.\n\nLooking at the partial products:\n\nThe first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD. Wait, so when you multiply the entire number MAD by E, you get MAD again? That can only be possible if E is 1. Because MAD \u00d7 1 = MAD. So E must be 1. Wait, but in the options, the second digit in the options is A, so looking at the options, in option A, the second number is 2, so A would be 2? Wait, the options are given as A)9 2 0 0 meaning A is 9, M is 2, I is 0, D is 0? Wait, maybe I'm getting the order wrong. Wait the question says \"decipher the following multiplication table\" and the options are labeled A to E, each with four numbers. The question says \"the options are the values of A, M, I, D in order.\" Wait, the question's options list the values for A, M, I, D in order. So for option A, the letters A is 9, M is 2, I is 0, D is 0. But D can't be 0 and also another 0? Because in that case, I and D would both be 0. Hmm, but maybe the problem allows that? Wait but cryptarithmetic puzzles usually require each letter to have a unique digit, but maybe not here. Wait, the problem didn't specify. Hmm, maybe I should proceed.\n\nWait, let's start with the first partial product. Since the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD, so E must be 1. Because if E is 1, multiplying gives the same number. So E is 1. That's a key point.\n\nSo E is 1. Now, the second partial product is MAD \u00d7 B, shifted left by one digit (because it's multiplied by the tens place, B is in the tens place of BE). So the second partial product is (MAD \u00d7 B) \u00d7 10. But in the problem, that's written as R A E, but shifted. Wait the second partial product in the multiplication is written as R A E, but since it's multiplied by B (the tens digit in BE), it should be shifted one place to the left, so R A E would actually be R A E0 (since it's multiplied by B and then shifted left by one digit, so it's like multiplying by B \u00d7 10). Wait but in the problem's setup, the second partial product is written as R A E, but that might actually be the non-shifted version? Wait no, the way multiplication is written:\n\nWhen you multiply by the units digit E (which is 1), you get the first partial product MAD. Then, multiplying by the tens digit B, you get the second partial product, which is (MAD \u00d7 B), but shifted one position to the left (i.e., multiplied by 10). So when written, the second partial product would be (MAD \u00d7 B) written as a three-digit number, but shifted, so when written under the first partial product, it's aligned to the left by one digit. But in the problem's setup, the second partial product is written as R A E. Wait, the problem's second partial product line is \"R A E\", which is three digits. So when shifted left by one, that would become R A E0? Wait, perhaps the second partial product (from B) is written as R A E, meaning that when shifted left (i.e., multiplied by 10), that's R A E \u00d7 10? Or maybe the R comes from a carryover?\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. Let's denote the numbers:\n\nLet me write the multiplication vertically as it's presented.\n\n       M A D\n     x   B E\n     ---------\n       M A D    (E \u00d7 M A D)\n     R A E      (B \u00d7 M A D, shifted left by one)\n     ---------\n     A M I D\n\nSo the first partial product (from E \u00d7 MAD) is MAD. Since E is 1, this makes sense because 1 \u00d7 MAD is MAD.\n\nThe second partial product comes from B \u00d7 MAD, shifted left one place. Therefore, the second partial product written as R A E must actually be B \u00d7 MAD, but when written shifted, so when added to the first partial product (MAD) to get the total product A M I D.\n\nWait, but when you shift left, the second partial product would be written as R A E followed by a zero? Or maybe not. Let me think of an example. Suppose MAD is 123, B is 4, E is 1. Then:\n\n123\nx 41\n----\n123 (from 1\u00d7123)\n492  (from 4\u00d7123 shifted left by one, so actually 4920)\n----\n5043\n\nIn this case, the second partial product is written as 492, but shifted left, so when added, it's 4920. But in the problem's setup, the second partial product is written as R A E, so that would be the three-digit number R A E, but when shifted, it would be R A E0. But in the total product, the digits are A M I D, four digits. So in the problem's case, when you add the two partial products (MAD and R A E shifted left), you get A M I D.\n\nWait, so the two partial products are:\n\nFirst: MAD (three digits, since E is 1)\nSecond: (B \u00d7 MAD) shifted left by one digit, so that's a four-digit number? Or three digits shifted left becomes four digits. For example, if B \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number, then shifted left by one digit (i.e., multiplying by 10) would make it four digits. But the second partial product in the problem is written as three digits R A E. So that suggests that B \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number R A E, so when shifted left, it's R A E0, which is four digits. Then adding that to the first partial product (three digits, MAD) would require the first partial product to be aligned to the right. Let me think of the addition step:\n\nThe first partial product is MAD (three digits). The second is R A E \u00d7 10 (four digits). Adding those together gives A M I D (four digits). So the sum is (MAD) + (R A E \u00d7 10) = A M I D.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's try to find possible digits.\n\nLet me note that the final product A M I D is a four-digit number. The first digit is A, which must be the same as the first digit of the first partial product's first digit. Wait, the first partial product is MAD, so its first digit is M. The total product's first digit is A, which is different from M? Or maybe not? Wait, in the final product, the first digit is A, but the first digit of the first partial product is M. So that suggests that when adding the two partial products, the carryover may have caused the first digit to change from M to A. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first digit A comes from the second partial product's first digit when shifted. Let me see. The second partial product is (B \u00d7 MAD) shifted left, so its digits would be R (the thousands place?), but the final product is four digits. For example, if B \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number, then shifted left, it becomes four digits. So the thousands digit is R, the hundreds is A, the tens is E (which is 1), and the units is 0? Wait, but the second partial product is written as R A E. Hmm, perhaps the shifted partial product's digits are R (thousands), A (hundreds), E (tens), and then the units digit from the first partial product's units. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think in terms of variables.\n\nLet me assign variables to the digits. Let's let:\n\nM, A, D, B, E, R, I be digits (0-9), with E = 1 (since E \u00d7 MAD = MAD). So E is 1.\n\nSo the problem reduces to:\n\n   M A D\nx    B 1\n----------\n   M A D      (1 \u00d7 MAD)\nR A 1        (B \u00d7 MAD shifted left by one)\n----------\nA M I D\n\nWait, the second partial product is written as R A E, which with E=1 becomes R A 1. But shifted left by one digit, so the actual value is R A 1 \u00d7 10 = R A 10? Or is the written line R A 1 already shifted? Hmm, perhaps the second partial product, when written, is R A 1 but shifted left so that its units digit is in the tens place. Therefore, when adding, the alignment would be:\n\n      M A D\n    +R A 1 0\n    ---------\n    A M I D\n\nWait, yes, because the second partial product (B\u00d7MAD) is shifted left one, so that's equivalent to multiplying by 10, so the second term is (B\u00d7MAD)*10. So adding (MAD) + (B\u00d7MAD \u00d710) = A M I D.\n\nLet me denote MAD as a three-digit number: 100*M + 10*A + D.\n\nBE is a two-digit number: 10*B + 1 (since E is 1).\n\nTheir product is (100*M +10*A + D)*(10*B +1) = (100*M +10*A + D)*10*B + (100*M +10*A + D)*1.\n\nWhich is exactly the sum of the two partial products: (B\u00d7MAD)*10 + MAD = A M I D.\n\nSo the total product is (B\u00d7MAD)*10 + MAD = MAD*(10B +1). And according to the problem, that equals A M I D.\n\nNow, let's look at the final product's first digit. The first digit of the product A M I D is A. The original number MAD's first digit is M. Let me see the product's first digit. Let's suppose that 10B +1 is the multiplier (since BE is 10B +1). The product is (MAD)*(10B +1). The first digit of this product is A, which must be the carryover from the multiplication.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps breaking down the multiplication step by step.\n\nLet me try to find possible values for the letters. Let's see:\n\nFirst, since E is 1, that's fixed.\n\nLooking at the second partial product's units digit. The second partial product is R A 1 (since E=1), but shifted left by one, so when written, its units digit is in the tens column. Wait no, the second partial product is B multiplied by MAD, then shifted left by one. So when we write it, the units digit of B*MAD would be the tens place of the final product? Wait, perhaps I need to look at the addition step.\n\nThe first partial product is MAD (units digit D). The second partial product, when shifted left, has its units digit at the tens place, so the units digit of the total product is D (from the first partial product's units digit). So the final product's units digit is D. Looking at the final product A M I D, the units digit is D, which matches. So that's consistent.\n\nThe second partial product's units digit (before shifting) is the units digit of B*MAD. Since the second partial product written as R A 1, the units digit of B*MAD must be 1 (since E is the units digit in the second partial product, which is 1). Wait, no. Wait, the second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD. The units digit of that product is the units digit of (B \u00d7 D). But since the second partial product is written as R A E (with E=1), the units digit of B\u00d7MAD must be 1. Therefore, (B \u00d7 D) mod 10 = 1. Because the units digit of B \u00d7 MAD is the units digit of B \u00d7 D (since the other digits in MAD don't affect the units digit when multiplied by B). So B \u00d7 D must end with 1. Since E is 1.\n\nSo B \u00d7 D \u2261 1 mod 10. Possible pairs for (B,D):\n\nPossible B and D digits such that their product ends with 1.\n\nPossible B and D:\n\n(1,1) \u2192 1\u00d71=1 \u2192 but E is already 1, so maybe duplicates allowed? Not sure yet.\n\n(3,7): 21 \u2192 no, ends with 1? 3\u00d77=21, ends with 1? Wait, no, 21 ends with 1? Wait 21 mod10 is 1. Oh right! 3\u00d77=21 \u2192 units digit 1.\n\nSimilarly, 7\u00d73=21.\n\nOr 9\u00d79=81 \u2192 ends with 1. So 9 and 9. But if B and D are 9, but then they could be same? Hmm, but letters might need to be unique. Alternatively, other possibilities:\n\nWait 1\u00d71 is 1, but E is already 1. So if B is 1, D would also have to be 1, but then E is 1, so three letters have same digit. Maybe possible, but perhaps the problem allows that. Let's consider possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, B and D could be 3 and 7, 7 and 3, or 9 and 9. Let me note that.\n\nSo possible pairs for B and D are (3,7), (7,3), (9,9), (1,1).\n\nBut let's see if we can get more constraints.\n\nLooking at the second partial product's tens digit. The second partial product is B \u00d7 MAD. The tens digit of that product is the A (since the second partial product is R A 1). Let me think: when you multiply B \u00d7 MAD, the result's tens digit is A. Let's see:\n\nLet me denote the product of B \u00d7 MAD as XYZ (three digits?), so that when shifted left, it becomes XYZ0? Wait, but the second partial product is written as R A 1, so perhaps the product B\u00d7MAD is R A 1, a three-digit number. Then when shifted left (\u00d710), it becomes R A 10. Adding that to the first partial product (MAD) gives the total product.\n\nWait, let me clarify.\n\nThe second partial product line as written in the problem is \"R A E\", but that represents the result of B \u00d7 MAD. Since E is 1, that product must end with 1 in the units place, as we saw. So B \u00d7 MAD is a three-digit number R A 1. So B \u00d7 MAD = 100*R + 10*A + 1.\n\nThen adding the first partial product (MAD) which is 100*M + 10*A + D, plus (B\u00d7MAD)*10 (since shifted left by one digit, so multiply by 10) gives:\n\nTotal product = (MAD) + (B\u00d7MAD)*10 = A M I D.\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nTotal = (100*M + 10*A + D) + 10*(100*R + 10*A + 1) = A M I D (which is 1000*A + 100*M + 10*I + D).\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side:\n\n100*M +10*A + D + 10*(100*R + 10*A +1) =\n\n100*M +10*A + D + 1000*R + 100*A +10 =\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1000*R + (100*M) + (10*A +100*A) + (D +10) =\n\n1000*R + 100*M + 110*A + D +10.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate step by step:\n\n10*(100 R + 10 A +1) = 1000 R + 100 A + 10.\n\nAdding the first partial product:\n\n(100M +10A + D) + (1000 R + 100 A +10) \n\n= 1000 R + 100 M + (10A + 100 A) + D +10 \n\nWait, 100 M comes from the first part's 100 M. Then, the 1000 R is from the second term.\n\nWait, sorry, let me re-express:\n\nThe first term is:\n\n100*M (hundreds place from MAD) + 10*A (tens) + D (units) \n\nThe second term after multiplying by 10 is:\n\n1000*R (thousands) + 100*A (hundreds) + 10*A (tens?) Wait no.\n\nWait the second term is 10*(100 R +10 A +1) = 1000 R + 100 A +10. So when you add:\n\nFirst part (MAD): 100M +10A + D \n\nSecond part (B\u00d7MAD \u00d710): 1000 R + 100 A +10 \n\nAdding them:\n\n1000 R + (100M) + (100 A +10 A) + D +10 \n\nWait, the 100 A comes from the second part, and 10 A from the first part. \n\nWait, let me sum all terms properly:\n\n- Thousands place: 1000 R\n\n- Hundreds place: 100 M (from first part) + 100 A (from second part) \u2192 100(M + A) \n\n- Tens place: 10 A (first part) + 10 (from second part's units?) Wait the second part has 10 in the units place? Wait the second part is 1000 R + 100 A +10. So when adding:\n\nThe first part's tens digit is 10 A, but the second part's tens digit comes from 100 A's tens place? Wait, no. Let me think of the sum as numbers.\n\nWait the total is:\n\nTotal = (100M +10A + D) + (1000 R + 100 A + 10) \n\n= 1000 R + 100 M + (10A + 100 A) + D + 10 \n\nWait, 100 M is from the first part's hundreds place, and 100 A is from the second part's hundreds place (since 100 A is part of 1000 R + 100 A +10). So adding the hundreds places: 100 M + 100 A = 100(M + A)\n\nThe tens place comes from 10 A (from the first part's tens digit) plus the 10 from the second part's units digit? Wait no. Let me see:\n\nThe second part's terms:\n\nThe second part is 1000 R (thousands), 100 A (hundreds), and 10 (units). The 10 is the units digit of the second part. The first part has D as units. So when adding:\n\nUnits digit: D (from first part) + 10 (from second part's units digit). Wait no, the second part's total is 1000 R + 100 A +10, so when added to first part's 100M +10A + D, the units digit is D + 10 (the units from the second part is 10, so the total units would be D + (10 mod 10)? Wait no, adding the two numbers:\n\nThe first part's units digit is D, and the second part's units digit is 10 mod 10 is 0 (since 10 is in the units?), wait no. Let me think of the second part as a number. The second part is 1000 R + 100 A + 10. So in digits, that would be:\n\n- Thousands place: R \n\n- Hundreds place: A \n\n- Tens place: 1 (since 10 is 10, so the tens digit is 1 and units 0?)\n\nWait no, 1000 R is thousands, 100 A is hundreds, and 10 is 10, so the tens digit is 1 (from the 10) and units digit is 0. So the second part's number is R A 1 0. Wait, no. Wait 1000 R + 100 A + 10 = R (thousands), A (hundreds), 1 (tens), 0 (units). Wait, yes. So the second part is a four-digit number R A 1 0. But in the problem's multiplication setup, the second partial product is written as a three-digit number R A E (i.e., R A 1), then shifted left? Wait I'm getting confused again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second partial product (B \u00d7 MAD) is a three-digit number R A 1, so when shifted left by one digit, it becomes a four-digit number R A 1 0. Adding that to the first partial product (M A D) gives the total:\n\n   R A 1 0\n+     M A D\n------------\nA M I D\n\nWait the first partial product is M A D (three digits), so when adding to the shifted second partial product (four digits), it would be aligned like this:\n\n   R A 1 0\n+    M A D\n----------\nA M I D\n\nSo the addition would have:\n\nUnits place: 0 (from R A 1 0) + D (from M A D) \u2192 must be D in the total's units. Wait the total's units is D. So 0 + D = D \u2192 which is okay, but there might be a carryover. Wait, if the addition in units place is D + 0 = D, so no carryover. So that's okay.\n\nTens place: 1 (from R A 1 0) + A (from M A D) \u2192 must equal I (the tens digit of the total). So 1 + A = I (mod 10), with possible carryover.\n\nHundreds place: A (from R A 1 0) + M (from M A D) plus any carryover from the tens \u2192 must equal M (the hundreds digit of the total A M I D). Wait the total's hundreds digit is M. So:\n\nA + M + carryover (from tens) = M + 10 * carryover_to_thousands ?\n\nWait let's think step by step.\n\nLet me denote the addition step:\n\nThe total product is:\n\nR A 1 0\n\n+   M A D\n\n= A M I D\n\nLet me write it vertically aligned:\n\n   R A 1 0\n\n    M A D\n\n+ -----------\n\n A M I D\n\nWait, but to add these numbers, the second number (MAD) is a three-digit, so aligning to the right:\n\n       R A 1 0\n\n         M A D\n\n      + -----------\n\n        A M I D\n\nSo the units digits: 0 + D = D \u2192 okay, no carryover.\n\nTens digit: 1 (from RA10's tens place) + A (from MAD's tens place) = I (the tens digit in the total). Since the total's tens digit is I, so 1 + A = I mod 10, and carryover (if any) is (1 + A)/10, integer division.\n\nHundreds digit: A (from RA10's hundreds) + M (from MAD's hundreds) plus any carryover from the tens place. The total's hundreds digit is M, so:\n\nA + M + carryover = M + 10 * carryover_to_thousands ?\n\nWait, the total's hundreds digit is M, so:\n\nThe sum of A (from RA10's hundreds) + M (from MAD's hundreds) plus any carryover from tens \u2192 must equal M plus 10 times some carryover (if moving to thousands place).\n\nSo let me write equation:\n\nA + M + c (carryover from tens) = M + 10 * k, where k is the carryover to thousands.\n\nSimplify: A + c = 10k.\n\nPossible values for A and c. Since A is a digit (0-9), and c can be 0 or 1 (since the tens place could have a maximum of 1 + A + ... Wait, the tens place sum is 1 + A (from the digits) plus any carryover from units. The units had 0 + D, which can't carryover (since D is a digit, so 0+D <10). So carryover from units is 0. So the tens digit sum is 1 + A. The maximum possible here is 1+9=10, so c can be 0 or 1.\n\nSo A + c = 10k. Since A is a digit between 0-9, and c is 0 or 1, possible options are:\n\nIf k=0:\n\nA + c = 0 \u2192 not possible (since A is at least 0, but if A=0, c=0, but then A's digit is 0, but then in the total product's first digit A would be 0, which can't be since it's the leading digit).\n\nIf k=1:\n\nA + c = 10 \u2192 possible if A=9 and c=1 (since 9+1=10), or A=8 and c=2 (but c can only be 0 or 1), so only possible A=9 and c=1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k=0 and A + c =0, but that would require A=0 and c=0, but then the thousands digit from the hundreds place would have to come from somewhere else. Let's see.\n\nWait, let's re-express the hundreds place:\n\nThe total's hundreds digit is M, so:\n\nThe sum of the hundreds digits (A from RA10 and M from MAD) plus carryover from tens (c) must equal M plus 10 times the carryover to the thousands. So:\n\nA + M + c = M + 10 * k \u2192 simplifies to A + c = 10k.\n\nTherefore, A + c must be a multiple of 10. Since A is a digit 0-9 and c is 0 or 1 (since the tens place can carryover at most 1), the only possibilities are:\n\nEither A + c = 10 (so k=1, and A is 9 with c=1, or 8 with c=2, but c can't be 2) \u2192 so only 9+1=10.\n\nOr A + c=0 \u2192 A=0 and c=0, but then the total's thousands digit would be from the carryover.\n\nSo let's consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: A + c = 10 \u2192 A =9, c=1.\n\nThen, in the tens place: 1 (from RA10) + A (which is 9) = I + 10*carryover (c). Wait, the tens digit sum is 1+9=10 \u2192 so I is 0 and carryover c is 1. So that works. So I =0, and c=1.\n\nTherefore in this case:\n\nA =9,\n\nc (carryover from tens to hundreds) is 1,\n\nI =0.\n\nSo that's a possibility.\n\nCase 2: A + c =0 \u2192 A=0 and c=0. Then, the tens place would have 1 (from RA10's tens) + 0 (A is 0) = I + 10*0 \u2192 I=1. But E is already 1 (from earlier), so I=1 would conflict with E. Unless duplicates are allowed. But since in cryptarithmetic puzzles usually each letter is unique, this may not be acceptable. Let's tentatively set this aside unless forced.\n\nSo proceeding with case 1, which gives us A=9, I=0, and the carryover from tens to hundreds is 1.\n\nNow, let's look at thousands place:\n\nThe thousands digit of the total is A (which is 9). The thousands digit comes from the sum:\n\nThe thousands digit in RA10 is R (since it's the first digit). Additionally, there might be a carryover from the hundreds place's calculation. The hundreds place equation gave us a carryover k=1 (since A + c = 10, so k=1). So the thousands digit is R + k (carryover from hundreds) must equal the total's thousands digit A (9). So:\n\nR + 1 = 9 \u2192 R =8.\n\nSo R is 8.\n\nSo far:\n\nA=9, M=?, I=0, D=?, B=?, R=8, E=1.\n\nNow, let's recall that the second partial product (B \u00d7 MAD) is R A 1 \u2192 which is 8 9 1 (since R=8, A=9, E=1). So B \u00d7 MAD = 891.\n\nSo B \u00d7 (100M + 10*A + D) = 891.\n\nWe know A=9, so MAD is 100M + 90 + D.\n\nTherefore:\n\nB \u00d7 (100M + 90 + D) = 891.\n\nAlso, the first partial product is MAD \u00d7 E = MAD (since E=1), so that's just MAD.\n\nThe total product is A M I D = 9 M 0 D (since A=9, I=0).\n\nThe total product is also equal to (MAD) + 10*(B \u00d7 MAD) = (1 +10B)*MAD.\n\nWait, since the total product is (MAD)*(10B +1) as earlier.\n\nSo 9 M 0 D = (10B +1) \u00d7 (100M +90 + D).\n\nAlso, from B \u00d7 MAD = 891.\n\nSo B \u00d7 (100M +90 + D) = 891 \u2192 equation (1).\n\nWe need to find digits B, M, D (each 0-9, with possible constraints).\n\nWe also know that the final product is 9 M 0 D, which is 9000 + 100*M +0*10 + D = 9000 +100M +D.\n\nAlso, from the total product being equal to (10B+1)*MAD:\n\n(10B+1)*(100M +90 + D) = 9000 + 100M + D.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complex, but maybe we can find possible B and MAD.\n\nSince B \u00d7 MAD =891, let's find factors of 891 where B is a single digit (1-9).\n\nFirst factorize 891:\n\n891 \u00f7 3 = 297 \u2192 3 \u00d7 297 = 891.\n\n297 \u00f7 3 = 99 \u2192 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 99 = 891.\n\n99 is 9\u00d711 \u2192 so overall factors are 3\u00d73\u00d73\u00d73\u00d711? Wait 891 = 3^4 \u00d7 11?\n\nWait 3^4 is 81, 81 \u00d7 11 is 891. Yes, so prime factors are 3^4 \u00d7 11.\n\nPossible factor pairs (B, MAD) where B is a single digit (1-9):\n\nWe need B \u00d7 MAD =891, so possible B can be 1,3,9, 11, etc., but since B must be a single digit, possible B options are 1,3,9, 9 (but 9\u00d799=891, 11 is too big), etc.\n\nLet me list all possible B (digits 1-9) and see if 891 divided by B gives an integer MAD (three-digit number).\n\nCheck B=1: 891/1=891 \u2192 MAD=891. So M=8, A=9 (matches A=9), D=1. But E is already 1 (since E=1), so D=1 would conflict with E. So D can't be 1. So this is invalid because D and E (1) would be same.\n\nB=3: 891/3 = 297 \u2192 MAD=297 \u2192 M=2, A=9 (which matches our A=9), D=7. Then D=7. Since E is 1, no conflict here. So possible.\n\nB=9: 891/9 =99 \u2192 but MAD must be a three-digit number. 99 is two-digit, so invalid.\n\nB= 11 \u2192 not a digit.\n\nWait any other factors?\n\nCheck B= 9 \u2192 gives MAD=99, which is two-digit. Not valid.\n\nB= 11? Not possible.\n\nB= 3: possible.\n\nB= 3 gives MAD=297 (M=2, A=9, D=7). Let's check if this works.\n\nSo in this scenario:\n\nM=2, A=9, D=7, B=3, R=8, E=1, I=0.\n\nNow, check the total product:\n\nTotal product is (10B+1)*MAD = (30 +1)*297 = 31 \u00d7297 = ?\n\nCalculating 30\u00d7297 =8910, plus 1\u00d7297 =297 \u2192 total 8910 +297 =9207 \u2192 which is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 which would correspond to A M I D being 9,2,0,7 \u2192 so A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7 \u2192 which is option D: 9 2 0 7. That's one of the options (option D).\n\nNow let's check if all the conditions hold.\n\nCheck the second partial product B\u00d7MAD =3\u00d7297=891 \u2192 which is R A E (R=8, A=9, E=1 \u2192 891, correct.\n\nThe total product is 9207 (A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7), which matches.\n\nNow check the addition step:\n\nThe second partial product shifted left is 891 shifted left (\u00d710) \u2192 8910.\n\nAdding the first partial product (MAD=297):\n\n8910 +297 =9207 \u2192 correct.\n\nCheck all letters' digits:\n\nA=9, M=2, I=0, D=7. These are all unique except E=1. Since letters must be unique (assuming), all letters except E must be unique. Since E is 1, which isn't among A, M, I, D here except D is7, so no conflict. So all letters are unique. So this is a valid solution.\n\nAre there other B possibilities?\n\nCheck B= 9, but that gives MAD=99 which is invalid (two-digit).\n\nB= 3 is the only valid digit so far.\n\nWait let me check B= 9 gives MAD=99, which is two-digit, so no. B= 1 gives MAD=891, but D=1 which is same as E=1. So that's invalid.\n\nWhat about B= 2?\n\n891 \u00f72 \u2192 445.5 \u2192 not integer. So no.\n\nB=4 \u2192 891/4 =222.75 \u2192 nope.\n\nB=5 \u2192 891/5=178.2 \u2192 no.\n\nB=6 \u2192 891/6=148.5 \u2192 no.\n\nB=7 \u2192 891/7 \u2248 127.285\u2026 no.\n\nB=8 \u2192 891/8=111.375 \u2192 not integer.\n\nSo only B=3 gives a valid three-digit MAD. So this is the only possibility.\n\nThus, the values are A=9, M=2, I=0, D=7, which is option D.\n\nLet me just check the other options to see if any could fit.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption D is 9 2 0 7 \u2192 which matches what we found.\n\nOption B is 9 2 0 9 \u2192 D=9. But then D=9 and A=9, which would conflict since A is 9 and D would also be 9. So that's invalid.\n\nOption C is 9 2 0 1 \u2192 D=1 which would conflict with E=1.\n\nOption A: D=0, but then D=0, but in our calculation, D was 7. So that's different.\n\nOption E: 9 2 2 2, which has duplicate digits.\n\nSo the correct answer is D.\n\n\nTo solve the multiplication table problem, we start by noting that the first partial product (MAD \u00d7 E) equals MAD, implying E must be 1. This gives us the equation structure:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{r}\n   M A D \\\\\n\\times \\quad B 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n   M A D \\quad (E \\times MAD) \\\\\nR A 1 \\quad (B \\times MAD \\text{ shifted left}) \\\\\n\\hline\nA M I D \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n**Step 1: Determine E = 1**\n\n**Step 2: Analyze the second partial product (B \u00d7 MAD):**\n- The units digit of \\( B \\times D \\) must be 1 (since E = 1).\n- Possible pairs for \\( B \\times D \\) ending in 1 are (3,7), (7,3), or (9,9). \n\n**Step 3: Partial product alignment and addition:**\n- The second partial product \\( B \\times MAD \\) results in \\( R A 1 \\), a three-digit number.
