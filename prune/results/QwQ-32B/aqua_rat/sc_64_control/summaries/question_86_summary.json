      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, the question is about a three-digit number M = abc, which means the digits are a, b, c. The reverse of that is N = cba. The conditions given are that M is greater than N, and also that M minus N plus 396c equals 990. We need to find how many such M's are there that are more than 300. The answer choices are given, but I need to work through it carefully.\n\nFirst, let's parse the equation given: M - N + 396c = 990. Let me write down M and N in terms of their digits. Since M is abc, it's equal to 100a + 10b + c. Similarly, N is cba, so that's 100c + 10b + a. \n\nSubtracting N from M gives: M - N = (100a +10b +c) - (100c +10b +a) = 99a -99c. Because the 10b terms cancel out. So M - N simplifies to 99(a - c). \n\nThe equation given is M - N + 396c = 990. Let's substitute M - N here. So 99(a - c) + 396c = 990. Let's simplify this equation. \n\nFirst, combine the terms with c: 99a -99c +396c = 99a + 297c. So the equation becomes 99a + 297c = 990. \n\nHmm, maybe factor out 99? Let's see: 99(a + 3c) = 990. Because 297 is 99*3, right. So dividing both sides by 99 gives a + 3c = 10. \n\nSo that's a key equation: a + 3c = 10. \n\nNow, since a, b, c are digits, each of them must be between 0 and 9, but with a and c having some constraints. Since M is a three-digit number, a can't be 0. Similarly, N is a three-digit number, so c can't be 0 either. Wait, because N is cba, so the first digit c must be non-zero. Therefore, both a and c are between 1 and 9. \n\nAlso, the condition M > N must hold. Let's see, since M is abc and N is cba, the difference between them being positive implies that a > c. Because if a is larger than c, then the hundreds digit of M is bigger, making M larger. So a > c is required here. \n\nSo now, we need to find all possible digits a and c (each from 1-9) such that a + 3c =10, and a > c. Also, since M is a three-digit number greater than 300, the first digit a must be at least 3 (since 300 is the lower limit, so a must be 3,4,...9). \n\nWait, the question says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". So M must be greater than 300, so a (the hundreds digit) must be 3 or higher. So a >=3. \n\nSo let's first find all possible a and c pairs that satisfy a +3c =10, with a and c being digits from 1-9, a> c, and a >=3. \n\nLet's list possible c values. Since c has to be at least 1, and a = 10 -3c. \n\nLet me see for c from 1 upwards and see what a would be. \n\nStart with c=1: a =10-3(1)=7. So a=7. Then check a> c? 7>1 yes. And a is 7 which is >=3. So that's valid. \n\nc=2: a=10-6=4. a=4>2. Yes. a is 4 >=3. Valid. \n\nc=3: a=10-9=1. But a must be at least 3. Because M has to be over 300, so a >=3. So a=1 here is invalid. \n\nc=0: Not allowed since c is first digit of N. \n\nc=4: a=10-12= -2. Negative, which isn't a digit. So stop here. \n\nWait, so possible c values are 1,2. \n\nWait let me check again. Let's go step by step.\n\nPossible c values from 1 to 9:\n\nc=1: a=7 \u2192 valid (since a=7 is >=3)\nc=2: a=4 \u2192 valid (4 is okay)\nc=3: a=1 \u2192 no, because a needs to be at least 3 (since M>300)\nc=4: a=10-12= -2 \u2192 invalid\nSo higher c's will make a even smaller or negative. So only c=1 and 2 are possible. \n\nThus, possible pairs are (a,c) = (7,1) and (4,2). \n\nWait a second. Let me confirm. \n\nWait for c=0, but since N is cba, c can't be zero. So yes, c starts at 1. \n\nSo only two possible pairs for (a,c). \n\nWait, but what about c=0? No, since c must be non-zero. \n\nHmm, so that gives us two possibilities for (a,c). \n\nWait, but let's check the equation again. \n\nWait, a +3c =10. \n\nWhat about c=3 gives a=1, but since a has to be at least 3, that's invalid. \n\nSo, only c=1 and c=2. \n\nSo for each of those pairs, the a is fixed, but what about the middle digit b? Since in the problem statement, the equation M-N +396c=990 didn't involve the b term. Because when we subtracted M-N, the b terms canceled. So the equation doesn't constrain b. So b can be any digit from 0 to 9. \n\nTherefore, for each of the (a,c) pairs, there are 10 possible values of b (0-9). \n\nSo the total number of possible Ms would be the number of (a,c) pairs multiplied by 10. \n\nSo how many (a,c) pairs are there?\n\nWe found two: (7,1) and (4,2). \n\nWait, but let me check again: \n\nWait, for c=1, a=7, which is okay. \n\nFor c=2, a=4, which is okay. \n\nc=3 gives a=1, which is invalid because a must be >=3. \n\nSo two pairs. \n\nThus, total possible Ms are 2 pairs * 10 (for b) = 20. \n\nWait, but the question asks how many values of M are more than 300. Since a is at least 3, which is already enforced by the constraints (since a is either 4 or 7 in this case), all these Ms are over 300. \n\nTherefore, the total number is 20. \n\nLooking at the options: the first option is A)20. So the answer should be A? But wait, let me check again. \n\nWait a second, let me confirm that M has to be greater than N. \n\nIn the problem, it says \"if M > N\", so that condition must hold. \n\nBut in our analysis, when (a,c) is (7,1), since a=7>1, so M>N. Similarly, for (4,2), a=4>2, so that also holds. So all those pairs already satisfy M>N. \n\nTherefore, all 20 numbers are valid. \n\nSo the answer is 20, which is option A. \n\nWait but wait, the options include E) None. So maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nHmm. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let's see another angle. \n\nWait, the equation a + 3c =10. \n\nWait, could there be other possible c values where a is >=3? Let me think again. \n\nLet me re-express the equation again:\n\na = 10 -3c. \n\nWe need a >=3, so 10-3c >=3 \u2192 3c <=7 \u2192 c <= 7/3 \u22482.333. Since c is integer, c can be 1 or 2. \n\nYes, exactly. So c can only be 1 or 2. \n\nSo that gives 2 pairs. \n\nHence, total Ms are 2*10=20, so the answer is A. \n\nHmm, but maybe I missed something. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the problem states \"how many values of M are more than 300\". Since all the a's in the valid pairs (7 and 4) are at least 3, so all the numbers are indeed over 300. Therefore, 20 is correct. \n\nSo the options are A)20, B)30, etc. So the answer should be A. \n\nBut wait, let me check the problem statement again. The equation given is M - N +396c = 990. Let me re-verify the steps. \n\nOriginal equation: \n\nM - N + 396c = 990. \n\nWe had M - N = 99(a -c). \n\nSo substituting: 99(a -c) + 396c = 990. \n\nThen, 99a -99c + 396c = 99a + 297c = 990. \n\nYes, because 396c -99c is 297c. 99a +297c = 990. \n\nThen factor out 99: 99(a + 3c) = 990 \u2192 a +3c =10. \n\nThat's correct. \n\nThus, the equation is correct. \n\nTherefore, the analysis holds. \n\nHmm. So I think the answer should be A)20. \n\nWait but the options have E) None. Maybe I made a mistake here. \n\nWait, let me think again: maybe the problem says M is a three-digit number, which requires a from 1-9, but when we have a=4 and c=2, that's okay. \n\nWait, but perhaps there's a mistake in the equation? Let me check with an example. \n\nLet me pick one of the possibilities and see. \n\nTake (a,c) = (7,1), and let's choose b as 5. \n\nThen M is 751, N is 157. \n\nM - N = 751-157 = 594. \n\nThen M - N + 396c = 594 + 396*1 = 594 +396 = 990. That works. \n\nAnother example: a=4, c=2, b=0. M is 402, N=204. \n\n402 -204 = 198. \n\n198 + 396*2 = 198 + 792 = 990. That works too. \n\nAnother case: a=4, c=2, b=9. M=492, N=294. \n\n492-294=198. 198 + 792=990. Correct. \n\nSo the equation holds. \n\nTherefore, the calculation is correct. \n\nThus the answer should be 20, which is option A. \n\nHmm, but let me check the question again. The problem says \"how many values of M are more than 300\". Since the a in all valid cases is either 4 or 7, which are both over 3, so all 20 Ms are above 300. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A)20. \n\nBut wait, the options given include E) None. Maybe there's a mistake in considering the constraints. \n\nWait, could there be another possible (a,c) pair? Let me see. \n\nWait, when c=0, but that's invalid because N would start with 0. \n\nc=2 gives a=4. \n\nc=1 gives a=7. \n\nWait, what if c=0.333...? No, c has to be integer. \n\nHmm. I think I considered all possibilities. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed that a must be a digit between 1-9, but in the cases above, yes. \n\nHmm, so I think the answer is A)20. \n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other constraints. For instance, when a=4, c=2, then since M has to be greater than N, but since a=4 and c=2, that's true. \n\nSo everything seems to check out. Therefore, the answer must be A. \n\nWait, but why is option E there? Maybe I made a mistake in counting. Let me see again. \n\nThe two (a,c) pairs:\n\nFirst pair (a=7, c=1): For each b (0-9), that's 10 numbers (701, 711, ...,791). \n\nSecond pair (a=4, c=2): similarly, 402,412,...492. So 10 numbers. \n\nTotal 20. So 20 is correct. \n\nSo the answer is A. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A)20, so the correct option is A. Therefore, I should choose that. \n\n**Final Answer**\nAnswer: A\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by expressing the three-digit numbers \\( M = abc \\) and \\( N = cba \\) in terms of their digits. \\( M \\) is \\( 100a + 10b + c \\) and \\( N \\) is \\( 100c + 10b + a \\). The given equation is \\( M - N + 396c = 990 \\).\n\nFirst, we compute \\( M - N \\):\n\\[\nM - N = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the given equation:\n\\[\n99(a - c) + 396c = 990\n\\]\nSimplifying, we get:\n\\[\n99a + 297c = 990\n\\]\nFactoring out 99:\n\\[\n99(a + 3c) = 990 \\implies a + 3c = 10\n\\]\nWe need to find valid digits \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) (each between 1 and 9) such that \\( a > c \\) and \\( a \\geq 3 \\) (since \\( M \\) must be greater than 300). Solving \\( a + 3c = 10 \\):\n\n- For \\( c = 1 \\), \\( a = 10 - 3 \\times 1 = 7 \\)\n- For \\( c = 2 \\), \\( a = 10 - 3 \\times 2 = 4 \\)\n- \\( c = 3 \\) gives \\( a = 1 \\), which is invalid since \\( a \\geq 3 \\)\n- Higher values of \\( c \\) result in negative \\( a \\), which are invalid\n\nThus, valid pairs \\((a, c)\\) are \\((7, 1)\\) and \\((4, 2)\\). Each pair allows \\( b \\) to be any digit from 0 to 9 (10 possibilities). Therefore, the total number of valid \\( M \\) values is:\n\\[\n2 \\text{ pairs} \\times 10 \\text{ values of } b = 20\n\\]\n\nAll these values of \\( M \\) are greater than 300 since \\( a \\) is at least 3. Thus, the number of valid \\( M \\) values is 20.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
