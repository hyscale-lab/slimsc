      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about a car moving towards the base of a vertical tower. The angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 over 10 minutes. We need to find out how much more time it will take the car to reach the base after that 10-minute period. Hmm, okay.\n\nFirst, I should draw a diagram to visualize the situation. Let me imagine the tower as a vertical line. The car is moving along a straight line towards the base of the tower. At two different points, the angles of elevation to the top of the tower are 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0. The time taken between these two points is 10 minutes. Since the car is moving at a constant speed, the distance it covers between those two points should be proportional to the time taken.\n\nLet me denote the height of the tower as h. When the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0, the car is at some distance x from the base. At that point, the tangent of 45\u00b0 would be opposite over adjacent in the right triangle formed. Since tan(45\u00b0) is 1, that means h/x = 1, so x = h. So, the initial distance when the angle is 45\u00b0 is equal to the height of the tower.\n\nThen, when the angle becomes 60\u00b0, the car has moved closer to the tower. Let's say the new distance is y. The tangent of 60\u00b0 is \u221a3, so tan(60\u00b0) = h/y => h = y\u221a3. Therefore, y = h / \u221a3.\n\nThe distance the car travels between these two points is x - y = h - (h/\u221a3) = h(1 - 1/\u221a3). \n\nSince the car is moving at a constant speed, the time taken (10 minutes) is proportional to this distance. Let me denote the speed as v. The distance covered in 10 minutes is (x - y) = v * (10/60) hours? Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, time is in minutes here. Hmm, maybe it's better to keep everything in consistent units. Let me think in terms of distance and speed. Let's say the speed is v (distance per minute). Then, the distance between the two points is (x - y) = v * 10. \n\nSo, the distance between the two points is h(1 - 1/\u221a3) = v * 10. \n\nNow, the question is asking for the time it will take to reach the base after the angle has reached 60\u00b0. At the point when the angle is 60\u00b0, the car is still y = h/\u221a3 away from the base. So the remaining distance is y, which is h/\u221a3. \n\nSo the time needed to cover that remaining distance would be (h/\u221a3)/v. \n\nWe need to express this time in terms of the given data. Let's see. From the previous equation, we can solve for v. Since h(1 - 1/\u221a3) = 10v, so v = h(1 - 1/\u221a3)/10. \n\nTherefore, substituting into the time for the remaining distance: (h/\u221a3) divided by [h(1 - 1/\u221a3)/10]. The h cancels out. So:\n\nTime = (1/\u221a3) / [ (1 - 1/\u221a3)/10 ] = (1/\u221a3) * [10 / (1 - 1/\u221a3) ]\n\nLet me simplify denominator first. Let me write 1 - 1/\u221a3 as (\u221a3 - 1)/\u221a3. So, substituting that in:\n\nTime = (1/\u221a3) * [10 / ( (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3 ) ] \n\nBecause dividing by a fraction is multiplying by its reciprocal. The \u221a3 in the denominator and numerator will cancel:\n\nSo, (1/\u221a3) * 10 * (\u221a3/(\u221a3 -1)) = 10/(\u221a3 -1) \n\nHmm, so that's 10/(\u221a3 -1). But to rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (\u221a3 +1):\n\n10*(\u221a3 +1)/ [ (\u221a3 -1)(\u221a3 +1) ] = 10*(\u221a3 +1)/(3 -1) = 10*(\u221a3 +1)/2 = 5*(\u221a3 +1) \n\nWait a second, that's interesting. So the time needed after the 60\u00b0 point is 5(\u221a3 +1) minutes? \n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5(\u221a3 +1). But the question says \"After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\" So, that would be exactly what I just calculated. \n\nWait but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the steps. Let me go through again.\n\nFirst, initial position when angle is 45\u00b0, distance is x = h. Then when angle is 60\u00b0, distance is y = h / tan(60) = h / \u221a3. The distance between those two points is x - y = h - h/\u221a3 = h(1 - 1/\u221a3). The time taken to cover that distance is 10 minutes. Therefore, the speed v is (h(1 - 1/\u221a3))/10 per minute. \n\nThe remaining distance after reaching the 60\u00b0 point is y, which is h/\u221a3. So time needed is (h/\u221a3) / v. \n\nSubstituting v: \n\nTime = (h/\u221a3) / [ h(1 - 1/\u221a3)/10 ] \n\nYes, the h cancels, so:\n\n(1/\u221a3) * 10/(1 - 1/\u221a3) \n\nThen simplifying denominator as done before gives 5(\u221a3 +1). \n\nHmm, so the answer is A)5(\u221a3 +1). But wait, the options listed include option A as 5(\u221a3 +1). So that would be the correct answer?\n\nWait but hold on, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the direction. Wait, when the angle increases from 45 to 60, the car is getting closer. So the distance between the two positions is x minus y, which is correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider the time after reaching the 60\u00b0 point. The remaining distance is y, which is h/\u221a3. Since the speed is v, the time is (h/\u221a3)/v. \n\nYes, so substituting v from the previous step (v = (x - y)/10 = [h - h/\u221a3]/10 ), so substituting that gives exactly that time. \n\nTherefore the answer should be A. \n\nBut let me check the options again. The options are:\n\nA)5(\u221a3 + 1)\n\nB)6(\u221a3 + \u221a2)\n\nC)7(\u221a3 \u2013 1)\n\nD)8(\u221a3 \u2013 2)\n\nE)None of these\n\nHmm, so A is exactly what I got. But wait, let me think again. Wait, when I calculated, I ended up with 5(\u221a3 +1). So yes, that's option A. \n\nWait, but maybe I messed up the direction? Let me see. For instance, when the angle is 45\u00b0, the distance is h, and when it becomes 60\u00b0, the distance is h/\u221a3. The difference is h(1 -1/\u221a3), which is correct. The speed is that difference over 10 minutes. Then the remaining distance is h/\u221a3, so time is (h/\u221a3) divided by (speed). Which gives the calculation above. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the units? Wait, no. Since the speed is in distance per minute, so the calculation is okay. \n\nHmm, so then the answer should be A. But wait, let me check the problem again. The question says \"After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\" after the 10 minutes during which the angle changed from 45 to 60. So yes, the time after that 10 minutes is indeed 5(\u221a3+1). So the answer is A. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let's see:\n\nStarting with time = [h/(\u221a3)] / v. And v = (h(1 - 1/\u221a3))/10. \n\nSo substituting v gives:\n\n[h/(\u221a3)] / [ h (1 - 1/\u221a3)/10 ] \n\nH cancels, so:\n\n[1/\u221a3] / [ ( ( (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3 ) ) / 10 ]\n\nWait, let me re-express (1 - 1/\u221a3) as (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3. So denominator is [ (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3 ) /10 ].\n\nSo the whole thing becomes [1/\u221a3 ] divided by [ ( (\u221a3-1)/\u221a3 ) /10 ]\n\nThat is equal to [1/\u221a3 ] * [ 10 * \u221a3/(\u221a3 -1) ]\n\nYes, so the \u221a3 in the numerator and denominator cancels with the denominator's \u221a3. So that leaves:\n\n1 * 10 / ( \u221a3 -1 )\n\nThen multiplied by \u221a3? Wait, no, let's see again:\n\nWait, the denominator was ( (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3 ) divided by 10? Or perhaps I need to recheck the fractions. Let me write it step by step:\n\nThe expression is (1/\u221a3) divided by ( ( ( ( \u221a3 -1 ) / \u221a3 ) / 10 ) )\n\nWait, sorry, the denominator in the big fraction is [ (1 - 1/\u221a3)/10 ] because v is (distance)/10. \n\nSo the denominator term is (1 - 1/\u221a3)/10. \n\nSo when you divide by that denominator, you invert and multiply. \n\nSo:\n\n(1/\u221a3) divided by ( ( ( (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3 ) ) / 10 )\n\nWhich is (1/\u221a3) * (10 / ( (\u221a3 -1)/\u221a3 )) \n\nSo that is (1/\u221a3) * 10 * (\u221a3/(\u221a3 -1))\n\nThe \u221a3 in the numerator and denominator cancels, giving (1) * 10/(\u221a3 -1) \n\nThen rationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (\u221a3 +1):\n\n[10*(\u221a3 +1)] / [ (\u221a3 -1)(\u221a3 +1) ] \n\nThe denominator is (\u221a3)^2 -1^2 = 3-1 =2.\n\nSo numerator is 10*(\u221a3 +1), denominator is 2 \u2192 5*(\u221a3 +1). \n\nYes, so that's correct. So the time is indeed 5(\u221a3 +1) minutes. \n\nThus the answer is A. So the correct option is A. \n\nWait, but I should check why the other options are there. Let me see. For instance, maybe someone might think the remaining distance is x instead of y. But no, when the angle is 60\u00b0, you are at distance y, so the remaining distance is y. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the angle relations. Let me check:\n\nAt 45\u00b0, tan(theta) = h/x \u2192 1 = h/x \u2192 x = h. Correct. \n\nAt 60\u00b0, tan(theta)=h/y \u2192 sqrt(3)=h/y \u2192 y = h/sqrt(3). Correct. \n\nSo the distance between the two points is x - y = h - h/sqrt(3). Correct. \n\nSpeed is that over 10 minutes, so yes. \n\nSo the calculation is correct, so the answer is A. \n\nTherefore, the answer must be option A. \n\nWait but the options given include option A as 5(\u221a3 +1). So that's exactly what I got. Therefore, the answer should be A. \n\nHmm, but let me check once again. Suppose the tower is 100m tall. Let me take h=100 for example. Then, when angle is 45\u00b0, the distance is 100 m. When angle is 60\u00b0, the distance is 100 / 1.732 \u224857.735 m. The difference between those positions is 100 -57.735 \u224842.265 m. \n\nSuppose the car took 10 minutes to cover that 42.265 m. Then, speed is 42.265/10 =4.2265 m/min. \n\nThe remaining distance is 57.735 m. Time would be 57.735 /4.2265 \u224813.66 minutes. \n\nNow, 5(\u221a3 +1) is 5*(1.732 +1)=5*(2.732)=13.66, which matches. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. \n\nHmm, so I think that's right. So the correct answer is A. \n\n**Final Answer**\nAnswer: A\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we start by noting that the car is moving towards the base of a vertical tower at a constant speed. The angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 over 10 minutes. We need to determine the additional time required for the car to reach the base after the angle reaches 60\u00b0.\n\n1. **Define Variables and Relationships:**\n   - Let \\( h \\) be the height of the tower.\n   - When the angle of elevation is 45\u00b0, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is \\( x \\). Using trigonometry, \\( \\tan(45^\\circ) = 1 = \\frac{h}{x} \\implies x = h \\).\n   - When the angle of elevation is 60\u00b0, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is \\( y \\). Here, \\( \\tan(60^\\circ) = \\sqrt{3} = \\frac{h}{y} \\implies y = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Distance Covered in 10 Minutes:**\n   - The distance covered between the two points (when angles are 45\u00b0 and 60\u00b0) is \\( x - y = h - \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} = h \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) \\).\n   - Let the speed of the car be \\( v \\). The time taken to cover this distance is 10 minutes, so:\n     \\[\n     h \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = v \\times 10\n     \\]\n     Solving for \\( v \\):\n     \\[\n     v = \\frac{h \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10}\n     \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the Remaining Distance and Time:**\n   - After reaching the point where the angle is 60\u00b0, the remaining distance to the base is \\( y = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} \\).\n   - The time required to cover this remaining distance at speed \\( v \\) is:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}}{v} = \\frac{\\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}}{\\frac{h \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying the denominator:\n     \\[\n     1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}}\n     \\]\n     Thus,\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}\n     \\]\n   - Rationalizing the denominator:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Time} = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5(\\sqrt{3} + 1)\n     \\]\n\nThus, the additional time required for the car to reach the base of the tower is \\( 5(\\sqrt{3} + 1) \\) minutes, which corresponds to option A.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]",
