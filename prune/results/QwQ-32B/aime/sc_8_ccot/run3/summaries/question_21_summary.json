      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A b-eautiful number is a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of its digits equals the square root of the number itself. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what a two-digit number in base b means. A two-digit number in base b would be written as \"ab\" where a is the first digit (the coefficient for b^1) and b is the second digit (the coefficient for b^0). Wait, actually, the digits are usually denoted as digits, so maybe I should use different letters to avoid confusion. Let me say the number in base b is written as d1 followed by d0. So the actual value of the number n in base 10 would be d1*b + d0. \n\nThe key condition here is that the sum of these two digits, d1 + d0, must equal the square root of n. So, mathematically, the equation we need is:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(n)\n\nBut n itself is equal to d1*b + d0. So substituting n into the equation, we get:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)\n\nHmm, okay. Since we need to find n such that this holds, perhaps I can square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let's try that:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nExpanding the left side gives:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nLet's rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps yet. Maybe it's better to express this equation as:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rearrange terms to group like terms. Let me see:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 - d1*b + d0^2 - d0 = 0\n\nHmm. Maybe factor terms with d1 and d0:\n\nd1*(d1 + 2*d0 - b) + d0*(d0 - 1) = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, their possible values are constrained. Specifically, d1 must be between 1 and b-1 (since it's the leading digit), and d0 must be between 0 and b-1. \n\nSo, for each base b, the digits d1 can be from 1 to b-1, and d0 from 0 to b-1. The number n is d1*b + d0, and the sum of digits is d1 + d0, which must equal sqrt(n). \n\nSo, perhaps we can set up the equation as:\n\nsqrt(d1*b + d0) = d1 + d0\n\nThen square both sides:\n\nd1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2\n\nSo, this is the equation we need to satisfy. Let's rearrange this equation to solve for variables:\n\nLet me denote S = d1 + d0. Then the equation becomes:\n\nd1*b + d0 = S^2\n\nBut since S = d1 + d0, we can write d0 = S - d1. Substitute that into the equation:\n\nd1*b + (S - d1) = S^2\n\nSimplify:\n\nd1*b - d1 + S = S^2\n\nFactor d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) + S = S^2\n\nThen, solving for d1:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S\n\nSo,\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm. Since d1 has to be an integer between 1 and b-1, and S is the sum of the digits (so S = d1 + d0, and since d0 is between 0 and b-1, S can be as low as d1 (if d0=0) up to d1 + (b-1). But since d1 is at least 1, the minimum S is 1 (if d0=0) and maximum S is (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. \n\nWait, but actually, since S = d1 + d0, and d0 can be up to b-1, the maximum S would be (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2, but since d1 is at least 1, the minimum S is 1 + 0 = 1. \n\nBut perhaps more importantly, since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and S must be such that (S^2 - S) must be divisible by (b -1), and the resulting d1 must also be an integer in that range. \n\nSo, for a given base b, we can iterate over possible values of S and check whether (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b -1), and then compute d1 as (S^2 - S)/(b -1). Then, check if d1 is an integer between 1 and b-1, and then d0 would be S - d1, which must also be between 0 and b-1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this equation as:\n\nd1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2\n\nSo, let me rearrange this equation:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0\n\nBut perhaps another way is to consider that since n = d1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2, so n must be a perfect square. So, n is a perfect square, and when written in base b, it is a two-digit number with digits d1 and d0 such that their sum is the square root of n. \n\nTherefore, for each base b, we can think of possible two-digit numbers in base b, compute their digits, check if their sum is the square root of the number, and count how many such numbers exist. \n\nBut since we need to find the minimal b where there are more than ten such numbers, perhaps we can find a formula or a way to compute the number of solutions for a given b, and then find the smallest b where that count exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, let's try to express variables in terms of S. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote S = d1 + d0. Then, from the equation:\n\nn = S^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nBut since d0 = S - d1, substitute into n:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + (S - d1) = d1*(b - 1) + S\n\nSo,\n\nS^2 - S = d1*(b - 1)\n\nTherefore,\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, this equation tells us that (S^2 - S) must be divisible by (b-1), and the result must be in [1, b-1].\n\nAdditionally, since d0 = S - d1 must be between 0 and b-1, so:\n\nd0 = S - d1 = S - (S^2 - S)/(b - 1)\n\nThis must be between 0 and b-1. Let me compute that:\n\nd0 = S - [ (S^2 - S)/(b -1) ]\n\nLet me write that as:\n\nd0 = [ S*(b -1) - (S^2 - S) ] / (b -1)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\nS*(b -1) - S^2 + S = S*b - S - S^2 + S = S*b - S^2\n\nThus,\n\nd0 = (S*b - S^2)/(b -1) = S*(b - S)/(b -1)\n\nSo, d0 must also be an integer between 0 and b-1. \n\nTherefore, for each possible S, we can compute d1 and d0 as above, and check if they are integers within their respective ranges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps S must be such that (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b-1), so that d1 is an integer. Let me note that S must be an integer between 1 and 2b - 2 (since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, each up to b-1). \n\nTherefore, for each base b, the possible values of S are integers from 1 up to 2b - 2, but perhaps even more constrained. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of S as variables, and see for each S, whether there exists a b such that (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b -1), and then compute the possible b's. But since we need to find the minimal b where there are more than ten such numbers, maybe it's better to fix b and count the number of valid (d1, d0) pairs for that base. \n\nLet me try to structure this:\n\nFor a given b, the number of b-beautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (d1, d0) where:\n\n1. d1 is between 1 and b-1,\n\n2. d0 is between 0 and b-1,\n\n3. d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0).\n\nWhich is equivalent to:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(n), and n = d1*b + d0.\n\nSo, squaring both sides gives:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0,\n\nwhich can be rewritten as:\n\nd1^2 + 2d1d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0,\n\nthen:\n\nd1^2 + 2d1d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0.\n\nAlternatively, as before, we can write d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b-1), where S = d1 + d0. \n\nSo for each possible S, compute d1 and check if it's an integer between 1 and b-1, and then check if d0 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of possible S and see for each S, whether the equations for d1 and d0 give valid digits. \n\nAlternatively, maybe to express S in terms of b. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we fix b, and try to find all possible S such that:\n\n1. S^2 = d1*b + d0,\n\n2. d1 + d0 = S,\n\n3. d1 \u2208 [1, b-1], d0 \u2208 [0, b-1].\n\nSo substituting d0 = S - d1 into the first equation:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + (S - d1) = d1*(b -1) + S,\n\nso,\n\nS^2 - S = d1*(b -1),\n\nso,\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1).\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the numerator must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be in that interval.\n\nTherefore, for each S, let's see if (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b -1), and then check if d1 is in [1, b-1], and then compute d0 = S - d1 and check that it's between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers S for which these conditions hold. \n\nTherefore, to find the number of b-beautiful numbers for a given b, we can iterate over possible S values and count how many such S satisfy the divisibility condition and the constraints on d1 and d0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find an expression for S in terms of b.\n\nWait, let me think of S as variable. Let me see:\n\nGiven that d1 must be (S^2 - S)/(b -1), and d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1. Let's denote:\n\nLet me write d1 = (S(S -1))/(b -1). Since d1 must be an integer, (b -1) must divide S(S-1). Also, since d0 = S - d1, and d0 must be between 0 and b-1, so S - d1 must be between 0 and b-1. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the possible S must satisfy:\n\n1. S(S -1) divisible by (b -1),\n\n2. 1 \u2264 (S(S -1))/(b -1) \u2264 b-1,\n\n3. 0 \u2264 S - (S(S -1))/(b -1) \u2264 b -1.\n\nThese are the constraints.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can reorganize the equation:\n\nLet me denote k = b -1. So k = b-1, so b = k +1, and k \u22651 (since b \u22652). Then, substituting:\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/k,\n\nand the constraints become:\n\nd1 must be integer between 1 and k (since b-1 = k),\n\nand d0 = S - d1 must be between 0 and k (since b-1 = k).\n\nSo, in terms of k, we can rephrase the problem as: For each k \u22651, find the number of integers S such that:\n\n1. S(S -1) divisible by k,\n\n2. 1 \u2264 (S(S -1)/k) \u2264k,\n\n3. 0 \u2264 S - (S(S -1)/k) \u2264k,\n\nand then the number of such S is the number of k+1-beautiful numbers. We need to find the smallest k+1 (i.e., b) such that this count exceeds 10.\n\nHmm, maybe this substitution could help. Let me see:\n\nLet me write equation for d0:\n\nd0 = S - d1 = S - (S(S-1)/k) = [S k - S(S-1)] /k = [ S(k - (S-1)) ] /k = [ S(k - S +1) ] /k\n\nWait, so:\n\nd0 = S*(k - S +1)/k\n\nHmm, so for d0 to be an integer between 0 and k, the numerator S*(k - S +1) must be divisible by k, and the result must be between 0 and k.\n\nAlternatively, since d0 must be an integer, then S*(k - S +1) must be divisible by k. But since d1 is already an integer (from the first condition), maybe this is automatically satisfied?\n\nWait, perhaps not. Let me see:\n\nd1 = S(S-1)/k must be integer,\n\nand d0 = S - d1 must be integer. Since S is an integer, if d1 is integer, then d0 is also integer. So perhaps the key constraints are the divisibility of S(S-1) by k, and the ranges for d1 and d0.\n\nTherefore, given that k = b -1, the problem reduces to counting the number of S such that:\n\n1. S(S-1) mod k =0,\n\n2. 1 \u2264 S(S-1)/k \u2264k,\n\n3. 0 \u2264 S - S(S-1)/k \u2264k.\n\nTherefore, for each k, the number of such S is the number of b-eautiful numbers (with b =k+1). We need to find the minimal k+1 (i.e., minimal b) where this count exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find a way to parameterize S in terms of k. Let me think of possible S values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to try small values of b and see how the count progresses, and then look for a pattern. However, since the problem is asking for the minimal b where there are more than 10 such numbers, maybe this would take a while. Let me see if we can find a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of S as varying, and for each S, find all k such that k divides S(S-1), and the other conditions hold. But this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of S(S -1) must be divisible by (b -1). Let me note that S and S-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, their product S(S -1) must be divisible by (b -1). Since they are coprime, (b -1) must divide either S or S -1, but not necessarily both. Alternatively, factors of (b-1) can be split between S and S -1. \n\nWait, but since S and S-1 are coprime, any common divisor of S and S-1 must divide their difference, which is 1. Therefore, gcd(S, S-1)=1. So the factors of (b-1) must divide either S or S-1. So, (b -1) must be a factor of S*(S -1), which are coprime, so (b -1) must be a product of a divisor of S and a divisor of S-1. Since they are coprime, the factors can't overlap. \n\nTherefore, (b -1) must be of the form d1*d2, where d1 divides S and d2 divides (S-1). Since gcd(d1,d2)=1. \n\nHmm, but perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe we can think of possible S for a given k = b-1. Let me consider possible S values.\n\nGiven that d1 = S(S-1)/k must be between 1 and k,\n\nso:\n\n1 \u2264 S(S -1)/k \u2264k,\n\nso,\n\nk \u2264 S(S -1) \u2264k^2.\n\nAlso, S must be at least 1, and since d0 = S - d1 must be non-negative,\n\nS - d1 = S - S(S -1)/k \u22650,\n\nso,\n\nS \u2265 S(S -1)/k,\n\nMultiply both sides by k (since k positive):\n\nS k \u2265 S(S -1)\n\nAssuming S \u22600,\n\nk \u2265 S -1,\n\nso,\n\nS \u2264 k +1.\n\nSimilarly, from the upper bound of d0 \u2264k,\n\nS - S(S-1)/k \u2264k,\n\nMultiply both sides by k:\n\nS k - S(S -1) \u2264k^2,\n\nS(k - S +1) \u2264k^2,\n\nHmm, not sure if this is helpful. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is that S must be between sqrt(k) and something else. Let me think numerically. Maybe trying to find an expression for S in terms of k.\n\nAlternatively, since S(S -1) must be divisible by k, perhaps S(S-1) is a multiple of k, so S(S-1) = m*k for some integer m. Then, d1 = m, so m must be between 1 and k.\n\nTherefore, m = d1 is between 1 and k,\n\nso,\n\nS(S-1) = m*k,\n\nwith m between 1 and k,\n\nand S must be such that d0 = S - m is between 0 and k.\n\nTherefore, for each m from 1 to k, we can check if there exists an integer S such that S(S -1) = m*k,\n\nand then check if d0 = S - m is between 0 and k.\n\nAlternatively, for each m from 1 to k, solve for S in the quadratic equation:\n\nS\u00b2 - S - m*k =0,\n\nand check whether S is integer and the corresponding d0 is valid.\n\nSo, solving the quadratic equation S\u00b2 - S - m*k =0,\n\nthe solutions are S = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +4*m*k)]/2.\n\nSince S must be positive, we take the positive root:\n\nS = [1 + sqrt(1 +4*m*k)]/2.\n\nSince S must be an integer, sqrt(1 +4*m*k) must be an integer. Let me denote t = sqrt(1 +4*m*k). Then,\n\nt must be an integer, and t\u00b2 =1 +4*m*k,\n\nso,\n\nt must be odd (since 1 + even is odd), so t=2p+1 for some integer p,\n\nthen,\n\n(2p+1)^2 =1 +4*m*k,\n\nexpanding,\n\n4p\u00b2 +4p +1 =1 +4*m*k,\n\nso,\n\n4p\u00b2 +4p =4*m*k,\n\ndivide both sides by 4:\n\np\u00b2 +p = m*k,\n\nso,\n\nm = (p\u00b2 +p)/k.\n\nTherefore, for m to be an integer, k must divide p(p +1).\n\nSince p and p+1 are coprime, k must divide either p or p+1, or split into factors dividing each. \n\nHmm, but this might complicate. Alternatively, since m must be between 1 and k,\n\nthen,\n\nfrom m = (p\u00b2 +p)/k,\n\nso,\n\nk divides p(p +1),\n\nand 1 \u2264 (p\u00b2 +p)/k \u2264k,\n\nso,\n\nk \u2264 p(p +1) \u2264k\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, p(p +1) must be between k and k\u00b2.\n\nHmm, this seems a bit too convoluted. Maybe it's better to approach numerically. Let me try small values of b and see how the count grows, then see where it exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a formula for the number of solutions for given b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is roughly proportional to the number of divisors of (b-1), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the equation again:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(n),\n\nand n = d1*b + d0,\n\nso,\n\nsqrt(d1*b + d0) = d1 + d0,\n\nthen squaring,\n\nd1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2,\n\nso,\n\nd1*b = (d1 + d0)^2 - d0,\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nd1*b = d1\u00b2 + 2d1*d0 + d0\u00b2 - d0,\n\nthen,\n\nd1*b = d1\u00b2 + 2d1*d0 + d0(d0 -1),\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables substitution. Let me set d0 = t,\n\nthen d1 + t = sqrt(n),\n\nand n = d1*b + t,\n\nso,\n\nd1 + t = sqrt(d1*b + t),\n\nthen squaring,\n\n(d1 + t)^2 = d1*b + t,\n\nso,\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2d1*t + t\u00b2 = d1*b + t,\n\nthen,\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2d1*t - d1*b + t\u00b2 - t = 0,\n\nHmm, maybe factor d1:\n\nd1*(d1 + 2t - b) + t(t -1) =0,\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, rearrange terms:\n\nd1\u00b2 + (2t - b)d1 + (t\u00b2 - t) =0,\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of d1:\n\nd1\u00b2 + (2t - b)d1 + (t\u00b2 - t) =0,\n\nWe can solve for d1:\n\nd1 = [ - (2t - b) \u00b1 sqrt( (2t - b)^2 -4*(t\u00b2 - t) ) ] / 2,\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\nD = (2t - b)^2 -4(t\u00b2 - t) =4t\u00b2 -4bt + b\u00b2 -4t\u00b2 +4t = -4bt + b\u00b2 +4t,\n\nSo,\n\nD = b\u00b2 -4bt +4t = b\u00b2 -4t(b -1),\n\nHmm, discriminant must be a perfect square for d1 to be integer.\n\nTherefore, for given t (d0), the discriminant must be a perfect square, and d1 must be positive integer between 1 and b-1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps trying small values of b first is better.\n\nLet me start with small b and count the number of beautiful numbers. The problem asks for the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, so maybe b around 20 or so?\n\nLet me try b=2 first.\n\nBase b=2:\n\nDigits d1 can be 1 (since leading digit can't be 0), d0 can be 0 or1.\n\nPossible two-digit numbers in base 2 are 10 (2), 11 (3).\n\nCheck if their digits sum to sqrt(n):\n\nFor 10 (n=2): digits sum 1+0=1. sqrt(2) \u22481.414\u22601. Not beautiful.\n\nFor 11 (n=3): digits sum 1+1=2. sqrt(3)\u22481.732\u22602. Not beautiful.\n\nSo, 0 numbers. So b=2 has 0.\n\nb=3:\n\nDigits d1=1,2; d0=0,1,2.\n\nPossible two-digit numbers:\n\n10 (3), 11 (4), 12 (5), 20 (6), 21 (7), 22 (8).\n\nCheck each:\n\n10: sum 1+0=1. sqrt(3)=1.732\u22601. No.\n\n11: sum 2. sqrt(4)=2. Yes! So 11 (base3)=4 is 3-beautiful.\n\n12: sum 3. sqrt(5)\u22482.236\u22603. No.\n\n20: sum 2. sqrt(6)\u22482.449\u22602. No.\n\n21: sum 3. sqrt(7)\u22482.645\u22603. No.\n\n22: sum 4. sqrt(8)=2.828\u22604. No.\n\nSo only 1 number (4). So count=1.\n\nb=4:\n\nDigits d1=1,2,3; d0=0,1,2,3.\n\nPossible numbers:\n\n10 (4), 11 (5), 12 (6), 13 (7),\n\n20 (8),21 (9),22 (10),23 (11),\n\n30 (12),31 (13),32 (14),33 (15).\n\nCheck each:\n\n10: sum 1. sqrt(4)=2\u22601.

Yes! 21 in base4 is 9.\n\n22: sum 4. sqrt(10)=~3.16\u22604. No.\n\n23: sum5. sqrt(11)=~3.316\u22605. No.\n\n30: sum3. sqrt(12)=~3.464\u22603. No.\n\n31: sum4. sqrt(13)=~3.605\u22604.

Count=1.\n\nTotal for b=4 is 1.\n\nHmm, so b=4 also has 1.\n\nWait, so maybe b=3 and 4 have 1 each.\n\nProceeding to b=5.\n\nb=5:\n\nDigits d1=1-4, d0=0-4.\n\nPossible numbers are 10 to 44 in base5, which are 5 to 24 in decimal.\n\nLet's check each two-digit number in base5:\n\nFirst, the numbers:\n\n10 (5), 11 (6), 12 (7),13 (8),14 (9),\n\n20 (10),21 (11),22 (12),23 (13),24 (14),\n\n30 (15),31 (16),32 (17),33 (18),34 (19),\n\n40 (20),41 (21),42 (22),43 (23),44 (24).\n\nNow check each for digits sum equal to sqrt(n):\n\n10: sum 1. sqrt(5)=2.236\u22601.\n\n11: sum2. sqrt(6)=2.45\u22602.\n\n12: sum3. sqrt(7)=2.645\u22603.\n\n13: sum4. sqrt(8)=2.828\u22604.\n\n14: sum5. sqrt(9)=3. So sum is 5 vs sqrt 3. Not equal. Wait, sqrt(9)=3, but digits sum to 1+4=5. Not equal. Wait, 14 in base5 is 1*5 +4=9. So sqrt(9)=3, but digits sum to 5. Not equal.\n\n20: sum2. sqrt(10)=3.16\u22602.\n\n21: sum3. sqrt(11)=3.316\u22603.\n\n22: sum4. sqrt(12)=3.464\u22604.\n\n23: sum5. sqrt(13)=3.605\u22605.\n\n24: sum6. sqrt(14)=3.741\u22606.\n\n30: sum3. sqrt(15)=3.872\u22603.\n\n31: sum4. sqrt(16)=4. So 31 in base5 is 3*5 +1=16. Sum is 3+1=4, sqrt(16)=4. Yes! So this is beautiful.\n\n32: sum5. sqrt(17)=4.123\u22605.\n\n33: sum6. sqrt(18)=4.242\u22606.\n\n34: sum7. sqrt(19)=4.358\u22607.\n\n40: sum4. sqrt(20)=4.472\u22604.\n\n41: sum5. sqrt(21)=4.583\u22605.\n\n42: sum6. sqrt(22)=4.690\u22606.\n\n43: sum7. sqrt(23)=4.795\u22607.\n\n44: sum8. sqrt(24)=4.899\u22608.\n\nThus, only 31 (base5)=16 is beautiful. Count=1.\n\nHmm, still only 1. Hmm.\n\nb=6:\n\nDigits d1=1-5, d0=0-5.\n\nNumbers from 10 (6) to 55 (35) in base6.\n\nThis might take time. Maybe find a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of checking each number, use the equation:\n\nWe have n = d1*b + d0,\n\nand d1 + d0 = sqrt(n).\n\nLet me denote S = d1 + d0,\n\nso n = S\u00b2,\n\nand also n = d1*b + d0 = d1*b + (S - d1) = d1*(b -1) + S,\n\nso,\n\nS\u00b2 = d1*(b -1) + S,\n\nso,\n\nd1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1).\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, let's compute possible S such that (S\u00b2 - S) is divisible by (b-1), and the resulting d1 is within 1 to b-1, and d0 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the possible S must satisfy:\n\n1. (S\u00b2 - S) mod (b-1) =0,\n\n2. 1 \u2264 (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1,\n\n3. 0 \u2264 S - (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo let me try to compute for b=6 (so b-1=5).\n\nPossible S can be from 1 to 2*6 -2=10.\n\nLet me check S from 1 to 10:\n\nFor each S:\n\nCompute (S\u00b2 - S)/5 must be integer between 1 and 5 (since b-1=5).\n\nCompute S\u00b2 - S divided by 5:\n\nS=1: (1-1)/5=0 \u2192 d1=0 invalid.\n\nS=2: (4-2)/5=0.4 \u2192 not integer.\n\nS=3: (9-3)/5=6/5=1.2 \u2192 nope.\n\nS=4: (16-4)/5=12/5=2.4 \u2192 nope.\n\nS=5: (25 -5)/5=20/5=4 \u2192 d1=4.\n\nCheck d0 =5 -4=1. Which is between 0 and5. So valid. So this is valid. The number is 4*6 +1=25. sqrt(25)=5=S. So yes.\n\nS=6: (36-6)/5=30/5=6. But d1=6 must be \u22645 (since b-1=5). So invalid.\n\nS=7: (49-7)/5=42/5=8.4 \u2192 nope.\n\nS=8: (64-8)/5=56/5=11.2 \u2192 nope.\n\nS=9: (81-9)/5=72/5=14.4 \u2192 nope.\n\nS=10: (100-10)/5=90/5=18 \u2192 which is way larger than 5, so invalid.\n\nThus only S=5 gives a valid solution. So count=1 for b=6.\n\nHmm. Still 1. Hmm.\n\nProceeding to b=7 (b-1=6):\n\nPossible S from 1 to 12.\n\nCompute (S\u00b2 - S)/6 must be integer between 1 and 6.\n\nLet me go through S:\n\nS=1: 0/6=0 \u2192 no.\n\nS=2: (4-2)/6=2/6=1/3 \u2192 nope.\n\nS=3: (9-3)/6=6/6=1 \u2192 d1=1, d0=3-1=2.\n\nCheck d0=2 is valid (0-6). So yes. The number is 1*7+2=9. sqrt(9)=3=S. Correct.\n\nS=4: (16-4)/6=12/6=2 \u2192 d1=2, d0=4-2=2. 2*7 +2=16. sqrt(16)=4. Correct. Valid.\n\nS=5: (25-5)/6=20/6\u22483.333\u2192 no.\n\nS=6: (36-6)/6=30/6=5 \u2192 d1=5. d0=6-5=1. 5*7 +1=36. sqrt(36)=6. Correct.\n\nS=7: (49-7)/6=42/6=7. But d1=7 exceeds b-1=6. So invalid.\n\nS=8: (64-8)/6=56/6\u22489.333\u2192 no.\n\nS=9: (81-9)/6=72/6=12. 12 >6, invalid.\n\nS=10: (100-10)/6=90/6=15>6, no.\n\nS=11: (121-11)/6=110/6\u224818.333\u2192 no.\n\nS=12: (144-12)/6=132/6=22>6\u2192 no.\n\nThus, valid S values are 3,4,6. So count=3 for b=7.\n\nSo 3 numbers: 9 (12 in base7), 16 (22 in base7), 36 (51 in base7). \n\nHmm, so b=7 has 3.\n\nb=8 (b-1=7):\n\nPossible S from 1 to 14.\n\nCompute (S\u00b2 - S)/7 must be integer between 1 and7.\n\nCheck each S:\n\nS=1: 0 \u2192 no.\n\nS=2: (4-2)/7=2/7\u2192 no.\n\nS=3: (9-3)/7=6/7\u2192 no.\n\nS=4: (16-4)/7=12/7\u22481.714\u2192 no.\n\nS=5: (25-5)/7=20/7\u22482.857\u2192 no.\n\nS=6: (36-6)/7=30/7\u22484.285\u2192 no.\n\nS=7: (49-7)/7=42/7=6 \u2192 d1=6. d0=7-6=1.

Count=3.\n\nHmm, still 3.\n\nHmm, maybe this is going to take a while. Maybe I need a better approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions is related to the number of divisors of (b-1). Let me think.\n\nLooking back at the equation:\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/(b-1).\n\nFor each S, the value (S^2 - S) must be divisible by (b-1). So for each divisor of (S^2 - S), there could be a possible b.\n\nAlternatively, for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers S such that (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b-1) and the constraints on d1 and d0 are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b-1=k, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of k? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that S(S-1) must be divisible by k =b-1. Since S and S-1 are coprime, the factors of k must divide either S or S-1. So for each factor m of k, we can set m divides S and k/m divides S-1, or vice versa.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions would be related to the number of factor pairs of k. \n\nLet me consider this. For each divisor m of k, we can write k = m * n. Then, set m divides S and n divides S-1, or m divides S-1 and n divides S. \n\nEach such factor pair (m, n) could give a solution S \u22610 mod m and S\u22611 mod n, or vice versa.\n\nHowever, solving these congruences might give solutions S modulo k. The number of solutions would depend on the number of coprime factor pairs.\n\nAlternatively, since S and S-1 are coprime, the divisors of k must be split between them. So each divisor d of k can be assigned to either S or S-1, but such that d divides S and k/d divides S-1 or the other way around.\n\nHence, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to factor k into two coprime divisors d and e, and then solving S \u22610 mod d and S\u22611 mod e (or vice versa). Each such pair would give a solution S modulo k, leading to one solution in the range 1 to 2k (since S can be up to 2k).\n\nBut since S has to be between 1 and 2k, each factor pair would give one solution. Thus, the number of solutions would be equal to the number of coprime factor pairs of k. \n\nSince the number of coprime factor pairs is 2^{number of prime factors of k} (since each prime factor can go to either d or e), but considering ordered pairs, so maybe the number of solutions is 2^{\u03c9(k)}, where \u03c9(k) is the number of distinct prime factors of k.\n\nWait, but this might not exactly hold. For example, if k is a prime, then the coprime factor pairs are (1, k) and (k,1). So two pairs. Each would give a solution. So for prime k, two solutions?\n\nWait, let me test with k=5 (b=6):\n\nk=5 (prime). Then, the coprime factor pairs are (1,5) and (5,1). \n\nFirst pair: d=1 divides S, e=5 divides S-1 \u2192 S\u22610 mod1 (always true), and S\u22611 mod5. So S\u22611 mod5. The minimal S is 1, but S=1 gives d1=(1-1)/5=0 invalid. The next is S=6, which is 6 mod5=1. So S=6. Then d1=(36-6)/5=6. But b-1=5, so d1=6 exceeds 5. So this is invalid. Hmm, so maybe this approach isn't directly giving valid solutions.\n\nAlternatively, the second pair: d=5 divides S, and e=1 divides S-1 (always true). So S\u22610 mod5. The minimal S=5. Then d1=(25-5)/5=4, which is valid (as we saw earlier for b=6). So this gives one valid solution. The other pair gives S=6 which is invalid. So only one solution, which matches the count for b=6. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the number of valid solutions is equal to the number of factor pairs where the corresponding S is within the required range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think of the number of valid S as the number of divisors of k. Wait, but for k=6 (b=7):\n\nk=6, factors:1,2,3,6.\n\nPossible factor pairs (d,e) with d*e=k and gcd(d,e)=1:\n\n(1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1).\n\nEach pair:\n\n1. (1,6): S \u22610 mod1 and S\u22611 mod6 \u2192 S\u22611 mod6. So S=1,7,13,\u2026 up to 2k=12. So S=1 and7.\n\nCheck S=1: d1=(1-1)/6=0 invalid.\n\nS=7: (49-7)/6=42/6=7, but b-1=6, so d1=7 exceeds. Invalid.\n\n2. (6,1): S\u22610 mod6, S\u22611 mod1 (always). So S=6,12.\n\nS=6: (36-6)/6=30/6=5. d1=5, d0=6-5=1. Valid. (This is the solution S=6 for b=7).\n\nS=12: (144-12)/6=132/6=22>6. Invalid.\n\n3. (2,3): S\u22610 mod2, S\u22611 mod3.\n\nS must be even and S\u22611 mod3. So S\u22614 mod6 (since 4 mod3=1 and even). Solutions in 1-12:4,10.\n\nCheck S=4: (16-4)/6=12/6=2. d1=2, d0=2. Valid. (This is S=4 for b=7).\n\nS=10: (100-10)/6=90/6=15>6. Invalid.\n\n4. (3,2): S\u22610 mod3, S\u22611 mod2.\n\nS must be multiple of3 and odd. So S=3,9.\n\nS=3: (9-3)/6=1. d1=1, d0=2. Valid. (This is S=3 for b=7).\n\nS=9: (81-9)/6=72/6=12>6. Invalid.\n\nSo total valid S:3 (S=3,4,6). Which matches the count of 3 for b=7. So here, each coprime factor pair gives one solution (the minimal S that is valid). \n\nThus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime factor pairs of k where S is in the valid range. For each coprime pair (d,e), there is at most one S in the range 1 to 2k which satisfies the congruences and gives a valid d1. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions for base b is equal to the number of coprime ordered factor pairs (d,e) of k =b-1, such that the corresponding S is between1 and2k and the resulting d1 and d0 are within their ranges.\n\nBut since each coprime pair (d,e) where d*e=k gives a unique solution S modulo k, and since S must be between1 and2k (as S can be at most 2k-1), each such pair can give at most one valid solution. \n\nHence, the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime ordered factor pairs of k. Since the number of coprime ordered factor pairs is 2^{number of prime factors of k} (since each prime factor can go to d or e). \n\nWait, for example, for k=6, which factors into primes 2 and3, so two prime factors, so 2^2=4 ordered coprime factor pairs, which matches the four pairs we had earlier. Each pair gives one solution (though some may be invalid). But in reality, some solutions may be invalid due to exceeding b-1. \n\nTherefore, the maximum possible number of solutions for a given k is 2^{\u03c9(k)}, where \u03c9(k) is the number of distinct prime factors of k. So to get more than 10 solutions, we need 2^{\u03c9(k)} >10. The smallest \u03c9(k) where this is true is \u03c9(k)=4, since 2^4=16. \n\nWait, but maybe it's not exactly that, because some pairs might lead to invalid S. But perhaps this gives a lower bound. So if we can find a k with \u03c9(k)=4, then potentially up to 16 solutions, but perhaps some are invalid. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal k is the smallest number with 4 distinct prime factors. The smallest such number is 2*3*5*7=210. But that would be b=211, which seems too big. Hmm, but maybe the number of solutions can be higher even with fewer prime factors, because of exponents? \n\nWait, actually, when considering coprime factor pairs, even with exponents, the number of coprime factor pairs would still be 2^{\u03c9(k)}, because each prime factor must be entirely in one factor or the other. \n\nFor example, if k= p^2*q, with two distinct primes, then \u03c9(k)=2, so still 4 coprime factor pairs. So exponents don't increase the number of coprime factor pairs. \n\nTherefore, to get 2^{\u03c9(k)}>10, we need \u03c9(k)\u22654. Since 2^4=16>10. So the minimal k with \u03c9(k)=4 is 2*3*5*7=210, leading to b=211, which is probably too big. But maybe in reality, even with fewer prime factors, the count can reach over 10 due to multiple solutions from the same pair? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of coprime factor pairs is actually double the number of unordered pairs, so for each unordered pair (d,e) with d<=e, there are two ordered pairs (d,e) and (e,d), unless d=e. But since we need coprime factors, and d*e=k, if d and e are coprime, then d and e are unique in that they are the coprime factors. \n\nWait, perhaps my initial assumption is correct, but in practice, even with \u03c9(k)=3, 2^3=8 solutions, which is still less than 10. So maybe \u03c9(k)=4 is needed. \n\nBut let me think again. Let me test with k=24 (b=25). \n\nk=24 has prime factors 2^3 *3^1, so \u03c9(k)=2. So 2^2=4 coprime factor pairs. But perhaps more solutions?\n\nWait, let me compute for b=25 (k=24):\n\nPossible S from1 to 48.\n\nThe coprime factor pairs (d,e):\n\nSince factors must be coprime and multiply to 24. The coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,24), (3,8), (8,3), (24,1),\n\n(2,12), but gcd(2,12)=2\u22601. So not coprime.\n\nWait, no. Wait, coprime factors must be pairs where gcd(d,e)=1 and d*e=24.\n\nThe possible coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,24), (3,8), (8,3), (24,1),\n\n(2,12): gcd(2,12)=2\u22601,\n\n(4,6): gcd(4,6)=2\u22601,\n\nSo only the first four pairs where factors are coprime. \n\nWait, 3 and 8 are coprime (gcd=1), so yes. So total four coprime factor pairs.\n\nThus, according to the earlier logic, there should be four solutions. Let's see:\n\nCompute S for each coprime pair:\n\n1. (1,24): S \u22610 mod1 and S\u22611 mod24 \u2192 S=1,25,\u2026 up to 48.\n\nS=1: d1=(1-1)/24=0 invalid.\n\nS=25: (25\u00b2 -25)/24=(625-25)/24=600/24=25. d1=25 exceeds k=24. Invalid.\n\n2. (24,1): S\u22610 mod24 \u2192 S=24,48.\n\nS=24: (24\u00b2-24)/24= (576-24)/24=552/24=23. d1=23, d0=24-23=1. 23*25 +1=576. sqrt(576)=24. Valid.\n\nS=48: (48\u00b2-48)/24= (2304-48)/24=2256/24=94>24. Invalid.\n\n3. (3,8): S\u22610 mod3 and S\u22611 mod8.\n\nS must be multiple of3 and S\u22611 mod8. Solve:\n\nLet S=3m, 3m \u22611 mod8 \u2192 3m\u22611 mod8 \u2192 m\u22613^{-1}*1 mod8. Since 3*3=9\u22611 mod8 \u2192 inverse is3. So m\u22613 mod8 \u2192 m=3+8t. Thus S=3*(3+8t)=9+24t.\n\nPossible S between1-48:\n\nt=0 \u21929, t=1\u219233, t=2\u219257>48.\n\nCheck S=9:\n\nd1=(81-9)/24=72/24=3. d0=9-3=6. 3*25+6=81. sqrt(81)=9. Valid.\n\nS=33:\n\n(33\u00b2 -33)/24= (1089-33)/24=1056/24=44. d1=44>24. Invalid.\n\n4. (8,3): S\u22610 mod8 and S\u22611 mod3.\n\nS must be multiple of8 and S\u22611 mod3.\n\nLet S=8m, 8m\u22611 mod3 \u2192 8\u22612 mod3 \u2192 2m\u22611 mod3 \u2192 m\u22612^{-1}*1 mod3. Since 2*2=4\u22611 mod3 \u2192 inverse is2. So m\u22612 mod3 \u2192 m=2+3t. Thus S=8*(2+3t)=16+24t.\n\nPossible S in range:\n\nt=0\u219216, t=1\u219240, t=2\u219264>48.\n\nCheck S=16:\n\nd1=(256-16)/24=240/24=10. d0=16-10=6. 10*25+6=256. sqrt(256)=16. Valid.\n\nS=40:\n\n(1600-40)/24=1560/24=65>24. Invalid.\n\nThus total valid S are 24 (23,1),9,16. So three solutions? Wait, S=24, S=9, S=16. So three valid solutions. But according to coprime pairs, there were four, but two pairs gave one solution each, and the other two gave one each but one was invalid. So total 3 solutions.\n\nHmm, so maybe my previous reasoning is not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of coprime factor pairs minus some invalid ones. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of k? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me try a different approach. Let me try to find a b where the number of solutions is over 10. Maybe start with b=24 (k=23). \n\nWait, but 23 is prime, so only two factor pairs, leading to maybe 1 solution. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let's try b=16 (k=15). Wait, we did that earlier and got 3 solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps trying b=24 (k=23) is not useful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try b=21 (k=20). Let me see.\n\nb=21, so k=20.\n\nPrime factors of 20: 2^2*5. So \u03c9(k)=2. So number of coprime factor pairs is 2^2=4. Let me compute.\n\nCoprime factor pairs of 20:\n\n(1,20), (4,5), (5,4), (20,1). Because 4 and5 are coprime (since 20=4*5).\n\nCheck each:\n\n1. (1,20): S\u22610 mod1 and S\u22611 mod20 \u2192 S=1,21,\u2026 up to 40 (since 2b=42? Wait, S up to 2*21=42).\n\nS=1: d1=(1-1)/20=0 invalid.\n\nS=21: (21\u00b2-21)/20= (441-21)/20=420/20=21. d1=21 exceeds k=20. Invalid.\n\n2.

(4,5): S\u22610 mod4 and S\u22611 mod5.\n\nS must be 0 mod4 and S\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet S=4m, 4m\u22611 mod5 \u2192 4m\u22611 mod5 \u2192 m\u22614^{-1}*1 mod5. Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5 \u2192 m\u22614 mod5. So m=4+5t \u2192 S=4*(4+5t)=16+20t.\n\nPossible S between1-40:\n\nt=0\u219216, t=1\u219236.\n\nCheck S=16:\n\nd1=(256-16)/20=240/20=12. d0=16-12=4. 12*21+4=256. sqrt(256)=16.

Valid.\n\nS=25:\n\n(625-25)/20=600/20=30>20. Invalid.\n\nThus valid S are 20,16,5. So count=3.\n\nHmm, same as before. So with two prime factors, still only 3 solutions.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to go higher.\n\nLet me try b= 105 (k=104). Wait, that might take too long. Let me try b= 30 (k=29, prime). Not helpful.\n\nWait, maybe try b= 25 (k=24). We did that earlier and found 3 solutions. Not enough.\n\nAlternatively, let's try b= 16 (k=15), we had 3 solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps trying b= 25 (k=24) gives 3 solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 21 (k=20): 3 solutions.\n\nHmm, perhaps trying a higher base with more prime factors. Let me try k= 60 (b=61). \n\nk=60 has prime factors 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00d75, so \u03c9(k)=3. So 2^3=8 coprime factor pairs.

So for k=210 (b=211), there are 15 solutions, which is more than 10. \n\nNow, is there a smaller k with more than 10 solutions?\n\nLet me try k= 120 (b=121), which had 7 solutions. Not enough.\n\nNext, let's check k= 180 (b=181), which has factors 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75, so \u03c9(k)=3. Still 8 pairs, so probably around 7 solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps k= 210 is the first with \u03c9=4, giving 15 solutions. But is there a smaller k with \u03c9=4?\n\nThe smallest k with 4 distinct prime factors is 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210, so yes. So 210 is the smallest such k. Thus, the minimal b is 211.\n\nHowever, let me check another k with \u03c9=4 but with exponents, but since exponents don't increase \u03c9, it's still 210.\n\nWait, but maybe a smaller k with more factor pairs? For example, k= 60 (which had \u03c9=3 and 7 solutions), but with \u03c9=4, the first possible is 210.\n\nThus, the minimal b is 211. But before concluding, let me check if there is a smaller k with more than 10 solutions.\n\nWait, maybe k= 120 (\u03c9=3) gives 7, k= 180 (same \u03c9) gives similar. Let me try k= 240 (b=241). \n\nk=240 factors into 2^4\u00d73\u00d75, so \u03c9=3. Thus, number of coprime factor pairs is 8. Likely similar count as before.\n\nAlternatively, let's try k= 210 is the minimal. So the answer is 211. \n\nWait, but the question asks for the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers. Since 210 is the first k with \u03c9=4, giving 15 solutions, then b=211 is the answer. \n\nBut before I finalize, let me check another k with \u03c9=4 but smaller than 210? But the smallest number with four distinct primes is 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210. So yes, it's the smallest. Therefore, the minimal b is 211.\n\nWait, but maybe there's another number with \u03c9=3 but with more factor pairs due to exponents?\n\nWait, for example, k= 30 (2\u00d73\u00d75), \u03c9=3. The coprime factor pairs would be:\n\n(1,30),(2,15),(3,10),(5,6), and their reverses, totaling 8 pairs.\n\nLet me see how many solutions k=30 gives.\n\nk=30 (b=31).\n\nCoprime factor pairs:\n\n(1,30), (2,15), (3,10), (5,6), and their reverses.\n\nLet me compute valid S:\n\n1.
