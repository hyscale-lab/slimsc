      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C intersect at point D. Then, the line AD intersects \u03c9 again at point P. We\u2019re given the sides AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. We need to find AP expressed as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then compute m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall some geometry concepts that might be helpful here. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, D is the exsymmedian point or maybe related to the symmedian? Or perhaps it's the exsimilicenter? Wait, actually, the point where the tangents at B and C meet is called the symmedian point? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the point where two tangents to a circle meet is called the ex-tangent point? Wait, no. Actually, in triangle geometry, the intersection of the tangents at two vertices is called the symmedian point? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using power of a point. Since D is the intersection of two tangents, DB and DC are both tangent to the circle \u03c9. Therefore, DB = DC, because the two tangent segments from a single external point to a circle are equal in length. Wait, but in a triangle, the lengths of the tangents from D to B and C would be equal only if D is equidistant from B and C? Hmm, but in general, if D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, then DB and DC are both tangent lengths from D to the circle. Wait, no, actually, the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center. Similarly for the tangent at C. So D lies along the external angle bisector? Maybe not. Hmm, perhaps I need to use power of a point for point D with respect to circle \u03c9.\n\nPower of a point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DT\u00b2 where DT is any tangent from D to \u03c9. Since D is on both tangents at B and C, so DB = DC. Wait, so that tells us that DB equals DC. Therefore, D lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC? Hmm, but in the triangle ABC, the perpendicular bisector of BC would pass through the circumcenter O. Hmm, but D is not necessarily on that unless BC is symmetrical? Maybe not necessarily. Wait, but since DB and DC are both equal as tangent lengths, so D is equidistant from B and C, so it lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. Therefore, the line AD passes through the perpendicular bisector of BC? Hmm, perhaps that's a key insight here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinate system to model this problem. Let me place point C at the origin for simplicity, and maybe align BC along the x-axis. Wait, let's see.\n\nLet me consider coordinates. Let me place point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC=9. Wait, but AB is 5, AC is 10. Wait, perhaps coordinate geometry might be a bit messy here, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using inversion or projective geometry? Hmm, but that might be overkill. Let me think again.\n\nSince the problem involves a triangle inscribed in a circle, with tangents from a point to the circle, and a line intersecting the circle again, perhaps power of a point and similar triangles could be helpful here.\n\nLet me recall that the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA, since AD is a secant line passing through D and intersecting the circle at A and P. Wait, actually, the power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. Therefore, DA * DP = DB\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, if I can compute DA and DB, then I can solve for DP, and since AP = DA - DP (if P is between D and A) or DP - DA (if D is between A and P). Wait, need to be careful with the direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe AP = DP - DA? Wait, depends on the configuration.\n\nWait, actually, let me consider the line AD. Since P is another intersection point of AD with the circle \u03c9, so starting from A, going along AD, you hit the circle again at P. Wait, but D is outside the circle, right? Because it's the intersection of two tangents. So AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), and then back to P? Wait no. Wait, the tangent points are at B and C, so the tangents from D touch the circle at B and C, so D is outside the circle, so line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside the circle), and then exits the circle again at P? Wait, but that can't be. Wait, no. If AD is drawn from A through D, then since D is outside the circle, the line AD would start at A (on the circle), go through D (outside), so the other intersection with the circle would be on the other side from D. Wait, but that would mean that P is between A and D? Hmm, maybe.\n\nWait, actually, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then the other intersection with the circle would be on the extension beyond D. Wait, but since D is outside, the line AD would pass through the circle at A, then exit at another point P? Wait no, if you start at A, go towards D, which is outside, so the line AD would pass through the circle at A and then exit at another point P further along the line from A through D. Wait, but then AP would be the distance from A to P, which is along AD beyond D? Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem states that AD intersects \u03c9 again at P, so P is the second intersection point. So starting from A, going along AD, you first reach the circle at A, then the next point is P. So that would mean that P is on the other side of D from A? Wait, no. Hmm, perhaps the exact configuration is important here. Since D is outside the circle, the line AD must pass through A (on the circle), go outward to D, so the other intersection P must be on the opposite side of A from D? Wait, that would mean P is between A and D? Wait, but then DP would be longer than DA. Wait, perhaps I need to draw a rough sketch mentally.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates would help. Let me attempt that approach.\n\nLet me set coordinate system with point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC=9. Then point A is somewhere in the plane such that AC=10 and AB=5. Let me find coordinates for point A.\n\nLet me denote coordinates as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let point C be (0,0), point B is at (9, 0). Let point A be (x,y). Then, AC = 10, so distance from A to C is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100.\n\nDistance from A to B is 5: sqrt( (x - 9)^2 + y\u00b2 ) = 5 \u21d2 (x - 9)^2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 9)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 25 - 100 \u21d2 x\u00b2 - 18x + 81 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -75 \u21d2 -18x +81 = -75 \u21d2 -18x = -156 \u21d2 x = 156 / 18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nThen plugging back x into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100:\n\n(26/3)^2 + y\u00b2 = 100 \u21d2 (676/9) + y\u00b2 = 100 \u21d2 y\u00b2 = 100 - 676/9 = (900 - 676)/9 = 224/9 \u21d2 y = \u00b1\u221a(224)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3.\n\nHmm, okay, so coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3) or (26/3, -4\u221a14/3). Let's assume it's the positive y-coordinate, so A is above the x-axis. So coordinates:\n\nA: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nB: (9, 0)\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9. Since points A, B, C are on the circle, we can find its equation.\n\nWe can find the circumcircle equation given three points. Let me do that.\n\nLet me denote the general equation of a circle as:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.\n\nPlugging in point C (0,0):\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + F = 0 \u21d2 F = 0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey = 0.\n\nNow plug in point B (9,0):\n\n81 + 0 + 9D + 0 = 0 \u21d2 9D = -81 \u21d2 D = -9.\n\nPlug in point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\n( (26/3)^2 ) + ( (4\u221a14/3)^2 ) + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) = 0.\n\nFirst compute (26/3)^2 = 676/9,\n\n(4\u221a14/3)^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9,\n\nSo adding those: (676 + 224)/9 = 900/9 = 100.\n\nSo 100 + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) = 0.\n\nWe already have D = -9, so substitute that:\n\n100 + (-9)*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) = 0\n\nCompute -9*(26/3) = -78,\n\nSo 100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3) E = 0 \u21d2 22 + (4\u221a14/3) E = 0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14/3) E = -22 \u21d2 E = (-22) * 3 / (4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\nE = (-33)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-33\u221a14)/(28).\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14/28)y = 0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there is a better way?\n\nAlternatively, since we know coordinates of A, B, C, perhaps we can compute the circumradius and the center?\n\nLet me compute the circumradius. The formula for the circumradius R of triangle ABC is (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394), where a, b, c are sides, and \u0394 is the area.\n\nGiven sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.\n\nLet me compute the area \u0394 using Heron's formula.\n\ns = (5 + 9 +10)/2 = 24/2 =12.\n\n\u0394 = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) ) = sqrt(12*7*3*2) = sqrt(12*7*6) = sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) Hmm, wait, let me compute:\n\nWait, 12*7=84, 84*3=252, 252*2=504. So sqrt(504). Simplify sqrt(504):\n\n504 = 16*31.5? Wait 16*31.5 is 504? Wait 16*30=480, plus 16*1.5=24, so yes. But 504 factors into 16*31.5? Wait, actually, let's factor 504 properly:\n\n504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but let's do prime factors:\n\n504 = 8 * 63 = 8 * 7 * 9 = 8 * 7 * 3^2. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*7*9) = sqrt(8)*sqrt(7)*sqrt(9) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, area \u0394 = 6\u221a14.\n\nSo the circumradius R = (a*b*c)/(4\u0394) = (5*9*10)/(4*6\u221a14) = 450/(24\u221a14) = 75/(4\u221a14). Rationalizing denominator:\n\n75/(4\u221a14) * \u221a14/\u221a14 = 75\u221a14/(4*14) = 75\u221a14 /56.\n\nHmm, okay. So the circumradius is 75\u221a14 /56. Not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find coordinates of the circumcenter O. Let me try that.\n\nThe circumcenter is the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC.\n\nFirst, find the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14 /3), coordinates of B: (9,0).\n\nMidpoint of AB: x = (26/3 +9)/2 = (26/3 +27/3)/2 = (53/3)/2 = 53/6,\n\ny = (4\u221a14/3 + 0)/2 = 2\u221a14/3.\n\nSlope of AB: (0 - 4\u221a14/3)/(9 -26/3) = (-4\u221a14/3)/( (27/3 -26/3) ) = (-4\u221a14/3)/(1/3) = -4\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB has slope 1/(4\u221a14).\n\nSo equation of perpendicular bisector of AB:\n\ny - 2\u221a14/3 = (1/(4\u221a14))(x -53/6 )\n\nSimilarly, let's find perpendicular bisector of AC.\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3), coordinates of C: (0,0).\n\nMidpoint of AC: (13/3, 2\u221a14/3).\n\nSlope of AC: (4\u221a14/3 -0)/(26/3 -0) = (4\u221a14/3)/(26/3) = (4\u221a14)/26 = (2\u221a14)/13.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AC has slope -13/(2\u221a14).\n\nEquation: y - 2\u221a14/3 = (-13)/(2\u221a14) (x -13/3 )\n\nNow, we need to solve these two equations to find the circumcenter O.\n\nThis seems quite algebra-heavy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the coordinates are getting messy, perhaps using parametric equations?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C. The tangent at a point on a circle can be written using the equation xx1 + yy1 + D(x + x1)/2 + E(y + y1)/2 + F = 0, but since F=0 here, maybe?\n\nWait, the general equation for the tangent at point (x1,y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D(x + x1)/2 + E(y + y1)/2 + F =0.\n\nWait, actually, the standard tangent equation for a circle at point (x1,y1) is:\n\nFor circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0,\n\nthe tangent is: xx1 + yy1 + D(x + x1)/2 + E(y + y1)/2 + F =0.\n\nAlternatively, since our circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14/28)y =0,\n\nthe tangent at point B (9,0) would be:\n\nx*9 + y*0 -9*(x +9)/2 - (33\u221a14/28)*(y + 0)/2 +0 =0.\n\nSimplify:\n\n9x - (9/2)(x +9) - (33\u221a14/56)y =0.\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 9x,\n\nSecond term: - (9/2)x - (81/2),\n\nThird term: - (33\u221a14/56)y,\n\nSo combining terms:\n\n9x - (9/2)x - (81/2) - (33\u221a14/56)y =0\n\nCompute 9x - (9/2)x = (18/2 -9/2)x = (9/2)x,\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n(9/2)x - (33\u221a14/56)y - 81/2 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by 56 to eliminate denominators:\n\n56*(9/2)x - 56*(33\u221a14/56)y -56*(81/2) =0\n\nSimplify:\n\n28*9 x - 33\u221a14 y - 28*81 =0,\n\n252x -33\u221a14 y -2268 =0,\n\nDivide all terms by 3:\n\n84x -11\u221a14 y -756=0.\n\nHmm, that's the equation of the tangent at B.\n\nSimilarly, the tangent at point C (0,0):\n\nUsing the tangent formula:\n\nx*0 + y*0 -9*(x +0)/2 - (33\u221a14/28)*(y +0)/2 +0=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n- (9/2)x - (33\u221a14/56)y =0,\n\nMultiply both sides by 56:\n\n-252x -33\u221a14 y =0,\n\nThus, 252x +33\u221a14 y =0,\n\nDivide by 3:\n\n84x +11\u221a14 y=0.\n\nWait, so tangent at C is 84x +11\u221a14 y =0,\n\nand tangent at B is 84x -11\u221a14 y -756=0.\n\nTherefore, the point D is the intersection of these two lines:\n\nFirst equation: 84x +11\u221a14 y =0,\n\nSecond equation:84x -11\u221a14 y =756.\n\nLet me add the two equations:\n\n(84x +11\u221a14 y) + (84x -11\u221a14 y) =0 +756,\n\n168x =756 \u21d2 x =756 /168 = 756 \u00f7 84 =9, 9*168= 1512. Wait, 168*4.5=756? Let me compute 168*4=672, 168*4.5=672+84=756. So x=4.5=9/2.\n\nWait, so x= 756 /168 = 756 divided by 168:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 84: 756 \u00f784=9, 168 \u00f784=2, so 9/2. So x=9/2.\n\nThen, plug x=9/2 into first equation:\n\n84*(9/2) +11\u221a14 y =0,\n\nCompute 84*(9/2)= 42*9=378,\n\nThus, 378 +11\u221a14 y =0 \u21d2 11\u221a14 y = -378 \u21d2 y = -378/(11\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\ny = -378/(11\u221a14) * \u221a14/\u221a14 = -378\u221a14/(11*14) = -378/(11*14) *\u221a14.\n\nSimplify 378 divided by 14: 378 \u00f714=27, so 27/11 \u221a14. Wait,\n\nWait, 378 \u00f714: 14*27=378, yes. So:\n\ny = - (27/11)\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11).\n\nHmm, that's a bit messy, but okay.\n\nNow, we need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, let's find parametric equations for line AD.\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3),\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11).\n\nLet me compute the vector from A to D:\n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= -25/6,\n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14 /11 -4\u221a14/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(- (27*3 +4*11)/33 ) = \u221a14*(- (81 +44)/33 ) = \u221a14*(-125/33).\n\nSo the direction vector is (-25/6, -125\u221a14 /33). To simplify, maybe factor out common terms:\n\nFactor out -25/6 from x-component and -125\u221a14 /33 from y-component. Notice that -125/33 = -25*5/(3*11). Hmm, perhaps not essential.\n\nAlternatively, parametrize the line AD. Let me use parameter t such that when t=0, we are at A, and t=1, we are at D. Then, the parametric equations are:\n\nx = 26/3 + t*(9/2 -26/3),\n\ny = 4\u221a14/3 + t*( -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 ).\n\nCompute the differences:\n\nFor x-coordinate:\n\n9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= -25/6,\n\nSimilarly, for y-coordinate:\n\n-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(- (81 +44)/33 )= \u221a14*(-125/33).\n\nTherefore, parametric equations:\n\nx(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14)/33 t.\n\nWe need to find the other intersection point P of line AD with the circle \u03c9. Since A is already on the circle, the other point P corresponds to a different parameter t.\n\nWe can substitute x(t) and y(t) into the circle equation and solve for t.\n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14/28)y =0.\n\nLet me substitute x(t) and y(t) into this equation.\n\nFirst, compute x(t)^2:\n\n[26/3 - (25/6)t]^2 = (26/3)^2 - 2*(26/3)*(25/6)t + (25/6 t)^2,\n\nSimilarly, y(t)^2:\n\n[ (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14)/33 t ]^2 = (4\u221a14/3)^2 - 2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14/33)t + (125\u221a14/33 t)^2,\n\nThen, compute each term step by step. This seems very tedious. Maybe there's a smarter way?\n\nAlternatively, since point P lies on line AD and on the circle, and also, by power of a point D: DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Since we can compute DA and DB, then we can find DP, hence find AP.\n\nWait, power of a point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 (since tangent from D to \u03c9 is DB) which equals DA * DP. So DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Therefore, DP = DB\u00b2 / DA.\n\nTherefore, AP = AD - DP? Wait, but need to verify the direction.\n\nWait, the line AD goes from A to D, with D outside the circle, so the point P is another intersection point of AD with \u03c9. Since A is on the circle, going from A towards D, we exit the circle at P, so P is between A and D? Wait, no, because D is outside, so the line AD starts at A (on \u03c9), goes outward to D (outside). So the other intersection point P must be on the extension beyond D? Wait, that would mean that P is not between A and D but beyond D. Wait, but then AP would be AD + DP. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the exact positions.\n\nAlternatively, using vector approach, if t=0 is A, t=1 is D, then t beyond 1 would be beyond D. Since the circle is only intersected at A and P, then P must correspond to some t value different from 0. Since D is outside the circle, the line AD passes through A (t=0), exits the circle again at P when t is something else. Depending on direction, maybe t negative?\n\nAlternatively, let's compute DA and DP using power of a point.\n\nFirst, compute the length DA.\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11),\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nCompute DA:\n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= -25/6,\n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) = \u221a14*(- (81 +44)/33 )= \u221a14*(-125/33).\n\nThus,\n\nDA\u00b2 = (\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2 = (25/6)^2 + ( (125\u221a14)/33 )^2.\n\nWait, but let me compute DA numerically? Maybe messy, but let me see:\n\nAlternatively, compute DB, since DB is the tangent length, which can be computed as sqrt(DO\u00b2 - R\u00b2), but maybe better to compute directly.\n\nWait, since D is at (9/2, -27\u221a14/11), and B is at (9,0).\n\nCompute DB\u00b2:\n\n\u0394x =9 -9/2 =9/2,\n\n\u0394y =0 - (-27\u221a14/11) =27\u221a14/11,\n\nSo DB\u00b2 = (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14/11)^2,\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(9/2)^2 =81/4,\n\n(27\u221a14/11)^2 = (27\u00b2)*(14)/(11\u00b2)= 729*14/(121). 729*14=10,206,\n\nThus, DB\u00b2=81/4 + 10206/121.\n\nLet me convert to common denominator. Let me compute this as fractions.\n\nCompute 81/4 = (81*121)/(4*121) = 9801/484,\n\n10206/121 = (10206*4)/(121*4) =40824/484,\n\nAdding together: 9801 +40824 = 50625, so 50625/484. Therefore, DB\u00b2 = 50625/484.\n\nThus, DA * DP = DB\u00b2 = 50625/484.\n\nTherefore, DP = (DB\u00b2)/DA = (50625/484)/DA.\n\nBut we need to compute DA first.\n\nCompute DA:\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11),\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3,4\u221a14/3).\n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= -25/6,\n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3)= \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3)=\u221a14*(- (81 +44)/33)= \u221a14*(-125/33).\n\nSo DA squared is:\n\n( -25/6 )\u00b2 + ( -125\u221a14 /33 )\u00b2 = (625/36) + ( (15625*14)/(33\u00b2) )\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: 625/36,\n\nSecond term: 15625*14 = 15625*10 +15625*4 =156250 +62500=218,750,\n\nThus, 218750/(33\u00b2)=218750/1089.\n\nHence DA squared is 625/36 +218750/1089.\n\nConvert to common denominator. Let me compute 36 and 1089. 1089 is 33\u00b2=1089. 36 and 1089: prime factors?\n\n36=2\u00b2*3\u00b2,\n\n1089=3\u00b2*11\u00b2,\n\nThus LCM is 2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2 =4*9*121= 4*1089=4356.\n\nSo convert:\n\n625/36 = (625 * 121)/4356,\n\n218750/1089 = (218750 *4)/4356,\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nFirst term numerator: 625 *121. 625*121: 625*(120+1)=625*120 +625=75,000 +625=75,625,\n\nSecond term numerator:218750 *4 =875,000,\n\nTotal numerator:75,625 +875,000 =950,625,\n\nTherefore, DA squared =950625 /4356,\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9:\n\n950,625 \u00f79 = 105,625,\n\n4356 \u00f79=484,\n\nThus DA squared =105,625 /484,\n\nTherefore DA = sqrt(105625/484)= sqrt(105625)/sqrt(484)= 325/22,\n\nBecause sqrt(484)=22, sqrt(105625)=sqrt(25*4225)=5*65=325? Wait, 25*4225 is 105,625, yes. sqrt(4225)=65, so sqrt(25*4225)=5*65=325. Correct.\n\nTherefore DA =325/22.\n\nThus, DP = (50625/484)/(325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325).\n\nSimplify:\n\n50625 divided by 325: Let's see, 325*156= 325*(150+6)=48,750 +1,950=50,700, which is 50,700. But 50625 is 50,625, which is 50,700 -75 =325*(156) -75. Hmm, not exact division. Wait maybe factor numerator and denominator.\n\n50625 = 25*2025=25*81*25=25\u00b2*81= (25*9)^2=225\u00b2? Wait 225\u00b2 is 50,625. Yes, exactly.\n\nSo 50625 =225\u00b2,\n\n484=22\u00b2,\n\n325=25*13,\n\n22=22.\n\nTherefore,\n\nDP = (225\u00b2 /22\u00b2)*(22/(25*13)) )= (225\u00b2 /22\u00b2)*(22)/(25*13)\n\n= (225\u00b2 *22)/(22\u00b2 *25*13)\n\n= (225\u00b2)/(22*25*13)\n\nSimplify:\n\n225 divided by25 is 9. So 225\u00b2 /25\u00b2 = (225/25)^2=9\u00b2=81,\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nWait 225\u00b2/(22*25*13)= (225/(25))\u00b2 *225/(22*13) )? Hmm, perhaps another way:\n\nWait, let's compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 225\u00b2 *22,\n\nDenominator:22\u00b2 *25*13,\n\nSo cancel 22 from numerator and denominator:\n\n225\u00b2 / (22 *25*13),\n\nSo 225\u00b2 = (225)*(225),\n\n225 divided by 25 is 9, so 225=25*9,\n\nThus,\n\n225\u00b2 =25\u00b2*9\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nNumerator:25\u00b2 *9\u00b2,\n\nDenominator:22*25*13,\n\nCancel 25:\n\n25*9\u00b2 / (22*13),\n\nSo DP= (25*81)/(22*13)= (2025)/(286).\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nCheck if 2025 and 286 have common factors.\n\n286 factors: 2\u00d711\u00d713.\n\n2025 divided by 2? No, it's odd. Divided by 11? 2025 \u00f711 = 184.09, not integer. Divided by13? 2025 \u00f713=155.769\u2026 Not integer. So 2025/286 is reduced.\n\nWait, but 2025 is 45\u00b2, which is 9\u00b2\u00d725. 286 is 2\u00d711\u00d713. No common factors. So DP=2025/286.\n\nTherefore, DP=2025/286,\n\nDA=325/22,\n\nTherefore, AP = ?\n\nWait, need to clarify the direction. Since D is outside the circle, and line AD goes from A (on the circle) to D (outside), the other intersection P must be on the extension beyond D from A. Wait, so AP would be AD + DP?\n\nWait, no. Let me think of the points:\n\nStarting from A, going along AD to D (distance DA), then from D to P is DP. Since P is on the circle again, but beyond D, so the total length from A to P is AD + DP. Wait but according to power of a point, DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nWait, hold on. Let me recall the power of a point formula: For a point D outside the circle, and a line through D intersecting the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D. Here, line AD intersects the circle at A and P, so DA * DP = power of D = DB\u00b2,\n\nWait, but in terms of signed lengths, depending on the direction.\n\nIf we take DA as the length from D to A, and DP as from D to P, then since A and P are on opposite sides of D, DA and DP would have opposite signs. So the formula would be DA * DP = - power? Wait, perhaps I need to be careful with directed lengths.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the power of point D: DP * DA = DB\u00b2,\n\nWait, actually, the power of point D is equal to DA * DP, where DA and DP are lengths from D to A and D to P. Since both A and P are on the line through D, but in opposite directions? Wait, no. If D is outside the circle, then the line DP passes through A and P, so actually, the two intersection points are A and P, so the power formula is DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nWait, actually, the standard formula is: If a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D. Here, points are A and P, so DA * DP = power,\n\nBut depending on the order. If D is outside, and the line passes through A (closer to D) and then P (further away?), then DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is distance from D to P, so DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nThus, AP = DP - DA? Wait, if P is further from D than A is, then AP would be DP - DA,\n\nWait, let me imagine the line:\n\nD-----A-----P\n\nWait, but D is outside, so the line goes from D to A (distance DA), then from A to P, but since P is on the circle again, maybe P is on the other side? Wait, perhaps I need to draw it mentally again.\n\nWait, actually, since A is on the circle, and D is outside, the line DA passes through A, goes to D, and then beyond to P. Therefore, the two points on the circle are A and P, with P on the opposite side of D from A. Wait, that can\u2019t be, because then the line would go from A through D to P, but then P would be further away from A than D. So AP would be AD + DP,\n\nWait, but according to power of a point:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let DA be the length from D to A, and DP be the length from D to P. Since P is on the other side of D from A, then the distance from A to P would be AP = DA + DP,\n\nBut according to the power of a point, DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nWait, but in that case, if AP = DA + DP,\n\nthen we have two equations:\n\nDA * DP = (DB)^2,\n\nand AP = DA + DP,\n\nWe can solve for AP.\n\nLet me set variables:\n\nLet DA = x, DP = y,\n\nThen x*y = DB\u00b2,\n\nand AP = x + y,\n\nWe need to find AP = x + y,\n\nBut we have x = DA =325/22,\n\nSo y = DB\u00b2 / x = (50625/484)/(325/22)= same as DP above, which was 2025/286,\n\nTherefore AP = DA + DP = (325/22) + (2025/286).\n\nConvert to common denominator 286:\n\n325/22 = (325 *13)/286 =4225/286,\n\n2025/286 remains,\n\nTotal AP= (4225 +2025)/286 =6250/286.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 3125/143.\n\nCheck if 3125 and 143 have common factors.\n\n143=11\u00d713,\n\n3125 is 5^5, so no common factors. Thus, AP=3125/143,\n\nTherefore m=3125, n=143,\n\nCheck if they are coprime: 143 factors:11\u00d713. 3125 divided by 11? 3125/11\u2248284.09, no. Divided by13? 3125/13\u2248240.38, no. So yes, coprime.\n\nThus m +n = 3125 +143= 3268.\n\nWait, but let me confirm my steps again because that seems like a big number.\n\nWait, let me check AP = DA + DP? Let me think again.\n\nWait, if D is outside the circle, and line AD passes through A (on the circle) and goes to D, then the other intersection P must be on the other side of D from A. So from A to D is distance DA, and from D to P is DP, so the total distance from A to P is DA + DP. So yes, AP = DA + DP.\n\nSo with DA = 325/22 \u224814.77,\n\nDP=2025/286\u22487.08,\n\nThus AP\u224821.85,\n\n3125/143\u224821.85 (since 143\u00d721=3003, 3125-3003=122, so 21 +122/143\u224821.85). Seems okay.\n\nWait but let me check the calculation of DP again.\n\nWe had DB squared is 50625/484,\n\nDA is 325/22,\n\nThus DP=DB\u00b2 / DA = (50625/484)/(325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325)= (50625*22)/(484*325),\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNote that 484=22\u00b2,\n\nSo 484=22\u00b2,\n\nSo 50625*22 / (22\u00b2 *325)=50625/(22*325).\n\nNow, 50625 divided by 325:\n\n325 \u00d7156=50,700,\n\n50625 is 50,625, which is 50,700-75,\n\nSo 50625=325\u00d7156 -75,\n\nTherefore,\n\n50625/(22\u00d7325)= (325\u00d7156 -75)/(22\u00d7325)= [156/22 -75/(22\u00d7325)].\n\nHmm, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, 50625 \u00f7325 = let's divide numerator and denominator by 25: 50625/25=2025, 325/25=13,\n\nThus 50625/325=2025/13,\n\nTherefore, 50625/(22\u00d7325)=2025/(22\u00d713)=2025/286,\n\nYes, so DP=2025/286,\n\nTherefore AP= DA + DP=325/22 +2025/286,\n\nConvert 325/22 to denominator 286: multiply numerator and denominator by13: 325\u00d713=4225, 22\u00d713=286,\n\nSo 325/22=4225/286,\n\nAdding to 2025/286 gives total 6250/286,\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 2: 3125/143,\n\nYes, so AP=3125/143,\n\nThus m=3125 and n=143,\n\nTheir sum is 3125 +143= 3268.\n\nHmm, but I feel like that might be the answer, but I need to confirm once again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction of AP. Suppose instead that AP is DP - DA,\n\nWait, if P is between A and D,\n\nThen AP= DA - DP,\n\nBut in that case, since D is outside the circle, the line from A goes through P (on the circle) before reaching D,\n\nSo AP would be shorter than AD,\n\nBut according to the power of point formula,\n\nDA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nIf P is between A and D,\n\nThen DP would be less than DA,\n\nSo DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nBut in that case, AP = DA - DP,\n\nBut let's see,\n\nIf that were the case,\n\nLet me suppose AP = DA - DP,\n\nThen, with DA * DP=DB\u00b2,\n\nAP = DA - (DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nThus AP= (DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nCompute DA squared is (325/22)^2 = (325)^2 / (22)^2,\n\nBut DB squared is 50625/484,\n\nSo DA squared = (325)^2 / (22)^2,\n\n325\u00b2 is 105,625,\n\nSo DA squared =105625/484,\n\nThus DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2 = (105625 -50625)/484 =55,000 /484,\n\nThus AP= (55000/484)/(325/22)= (55000/484)*(22/325)= (55000*22)/(484*325),\n\nSimplify:\n\n55000 /484 =55000\u00f74=13750; 484\u00f74=121,\n\nWait, 55000/484 =55000 \u00f7 (4\u00d7121)= (55000 \u00f74)/121=13750/121,\n\nThus,\n\nAP= (13750/121)*(22/325)= (13750\u00d722)/(121\u00d7325),\n\nSimplify:\n\n13750 divided by 325: 325\u00d742=13,650, so 13750-13650=100,\n\nThus 13750=325\u00d742 +100,\n\nHmm, messy.\n\nAlternatively, note that 13750=1375\u00d710,\n\n325=25\u00d713,\n\n121=11\u00b2,\n\n22=2\u00d711,\n\nThus,\n\n13750\u00d722 = (1375\u00d710)*(2\u00d711)=1375\u00d72\u00d711\u00d710,\n\n121\u00d7325 =11\u00b2\u00d725\u00d713,\n\nSo,\n\nAP= [1375\u00d72\u00d711\u00d710 ]/[11\u00b2\u00d725\u00d713] = [1375\u00d72\u00d710]/[11\u00d725\u00d713]\n\nSimplify:\n\n1375 /25=55,\n\nThus,\n\n[55\u00d72\u00d710]/[11\u00d713] = (1100)/(143)= 1100 \u00f7143= 7.69 approx.\n\nBut if AP were this, it would be smaller than DA, but which is possible. But according to the problem statement, the tangent points are at B and C, and D is their intersection, so maybe my coordinate assumption was wrong?\n\nAlternatively, maybe my coordinate setup had an error? Let me check coordinates again.\n\nWait, when I set up coordinates with C at (0,0), B at (9,0), then A was computed as (26/3, 4\u221a14/3). Let's verify distances:\n\nAC distance from (0,0) to (26/3,4\u221a14/3):\n\nsqrt( (26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 ) = sqrt(676/9 + 224/9)= sqrt(900/9)=sqrt(100)=10, which is correct.\n\nAB distance between (26/3,4\u221a14/3) and (9,0):\n\nsqrt( (26/3 - 27/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 )= sqrt( (-1/3)^2 + (16\u00d714)/9 )\n\n= sqrt( 1/9 + 224/9 )= sqrt(225/9)=sqrt(25)=5, which is correct.\n\nSo coordinates are correct.\n\nThen, the tangent lines equations were computed correctly?\n\nFor tangent at B (9,0):\n\nUsed formula for tangent on circle x\u00b2+y\u00b2-9x - (33\u221a14/28)y =0,\n\nThe tangent at (x1,y1) is xx1 + yy1 -9*(x +x1)/2 - (33\u221a14/28)*(y + y1)/2=0,\n\nAt point B (9,0):\n\nSo,\n\nx*9 + y*0 -9*(x +9)/2 - (33\u221a14/28)*(y +0)/2 =0,\n\nWhich simplifies to 9x - (9/2)(x +9) - (33\u221a14/56)y =0,\n\nWhich led to 84x -11\u221a14 y -756 =0,\n\nSimilarly tangent at C(0,0):\n\nx*0 + y*0 -9*(x +0)/2 - (33\u221a14/28)*(y +0)/2=0,\n\nWhich is - (9/2)x - (33\u221a14/56)y =0,\n\nMultiply by 56: -252x -33\u221a14 y=0 \u2192 252x +33\u221a14 y=0,\n\nThus, equations are correct.\n\nSolving for D:\n\n84x -11\u221a14 y =756,\n\n84x +11\u221a14 y =0,\n\nAdding:168x=756\u2192x=4.5=9/2,\n\nSubtract: 22\u221a14 y= -756 \u2192 y= -756/(22\u221a14)= -378/(11\u221a14),\n\nWhich when rationalized is - (378\u221a14)/(11*14)= -27\u221a14/11,\n\nWait, 378 divided by14 is 27. So yes, y= -27\u221a14 /11,\n\nThus coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Correct.\n\nThen DA calculation was between A(26/3,4\u221a14/3) and D(9/2, -27\u221a14/11):\n\ndx=9/2 -26/3= (27 -52)/6= -25/6,\n\ndy= -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3= \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3)=\u221a14*(- (81 +44)/33 )=\u221a14*(-125/33),\n\nThus DA squared is (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14/33)^2,\n\nWhich is 625/36 + (15625\u00d714)/1089,\n\n=625/36 + 218750/1089,\n\nConvert to common denominator 4356,\n\n625/36 = (625\u00d7121)/4356,\n\n218750/1089=(218750\u00d74)/4356,\n\nTotal numerator: 625\u00d7121 +218750\u00d74,\n\nCompute 625\u00d7121:\n\n625\u00d7120=75,000,\n\n625\u00d71=625,\n\nTotal 75,625,\n\n218,750\u00d74=875,000,\n\nTotal numerator:75,625 +875,000=950,625,\n\nThus DA squared is 950,625 /4356,\n\nWhich reduces to (950,625 \u00f79)/(4356 \u00f79)=105,625 /484,\n\nThus DA= sqrt(105625/484)= 325/22,\n\nCorrect.\n\nThen DP= DB squared / DA,\n\nDB squared is (distance from D to B)^2,\n\nCoordinates of D(9/2, -27\u221a14 /11) and B(9,0):\n\ndx=9 -9/2=9/2,\n\ndy=0 - (-27\u221a14/11)=27\u221a14/11,\n\nThus, DB squared is (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14/11)^2,\n\n=81/4 + (729\u00d714)/121,\n\n=81/4 + 10,206/121,\n\nConvert to common denominator,\n\n81/4= (81\u00d7121)/484,\n\n10,206/121= (10,206\u00d74)/484,\n\nTotal numerator: (81\u00d7121)+ (10,206\u00d74),\n\n81\u00d7121= 9,801,\n\n10,206\u00d74=40,824,\n\nTotal 9,801 +40,824=50,625,\n\nThus DB squared=50,625 /484,\n\nTherefore DP= (50,625/484)/(325/22)= (50,625\u00d722)/(484\u00d7325)= (50,625/325)*(22/484),\n\n50,625 divided by325: 50,625 \u00f7325,\n\n325\u00d7156=50,700,\n\nThus 50,625=325\u00d7156 -75,\n\nSo,\n\n(325\u00d7156 -75)/325 =156 -75/325,\n\nHmm but perhaps better as fractions,\n\n50,625/325= (50,625 \u00f725)/(325 \u00f725)=2025/13,\n\nThus,\n\nDP= (2025/13)*(22/484)= (2025\u00d722)/(13\u00d7484),\n\n484=4\u00d7121=4\u00d711\u00b2,\n\n22=2\u00d711,\n\nThus,\n\n2025\u00d722=2025\u00d72\u00d711,\n\n13\u00d7484=13\u00d74\u00d711\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nDP= (2025\u00d72\u00d711)/(13\u00d74\u00d711\u00b2)= (2025\u00d72)/(13\u00d74\u00d711)= (4050)/(572)= 2025/286,\n\nYes, same as before.\n\nTherefore, AP= DA + DP=325/22 +2025/286,\n\nConvert 325/22 to 4225/286,\n\nTotal:4225 +2025=6250,\n\n6250/286 simplifies to 3125/143,\n\nSo yes, that is correct.\n\nThus, m=3125 and n=143, which are coprime (since 143=11\u00d713 and 3125 is 5^5), so their sum is 3125+143=3268.\n\nHmm, but I recall that in some Olympiad problems, the answer might be smaller. Maybe I made a mistake in the direction of AP?\n\nWait, let me think differently. Suppose the line AD goes from A through P to D. Since P is on the circle, if P is between A and D, then AP * AD = power? Wait no.\n\nWait, the power of point D is equal to DB\u00b2 = DP * DA,\n\nWhere DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P,\n\nBut if P is between A and D, then DP = DA - AP,\n\nWait, let me define variables properly:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that along the line AD, starting at A, going towards D, the other intersection with the circle is P. Since D is outside, then P must be between A and D? Or beyond D?\n\nWait, the tangent points are at B and C, so the point D is the exsymmedian point? Hmm, perhaps it's better to think in terms of harmonic division or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using inversion. But perhaps my calculations are correct, and the answer is indeed 3268.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I messed up the sign in the power of a point.\n\nPower of a point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA,\n\nWait, but DA is the distance from D to A, but if P is on the other side, then the power is DP * DA, where DP is the length from D to P, but depending on the direction.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is:\n\nIf a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = power.\n\nHere, the line AD intersects the circle at A and P, so DA * DP = power,\n\nBut if P is beyond D from A, then DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, so DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nThus AP = AD + DP,\n\nWait, but AD is the distance from A to D,\n\nWait, sorry,\n\nLet me use directed lengths. Let\u2019s set coordinate system along the line AD, with D at 0, A at distance DA (positive direction), then P would be at distance DP (negative direction?) Wait, perhaps:\n\nLet me assign coordinates on line AD such that D is at 0, and the direction from D to A is positive. So point A is at +DA, and point P is another intersection point. Since D is outside, P must be on the opposite side of D from A, so P is at -DP.\n\nThus the power formula would be DA * (-DP) = - DA * DP = power, but power is positive, so actually, the product of the signed distances is negative the power? Hmm, perhaps better to stick with absolute values.\n\nThus, the formula is DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nWith DA and DP as lengths,\n\nTherefore, if P is beyond D from A, then AP = AD + DP,\n\nWhich we computed as 3125/143,\n\nAlternatively, if P is between A and D,\n\nThen AP = DA - DP,\n\nBut then DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nSo AP = DA - (DB\u00b2 / DA),\n\nWhich would be,\n\nAP = (DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nPlugging numbers,\n\nDA squared is (325/22)^2 =105625/484,\n\nDB squared is 50625/484,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = (105625 -50625)/484 divided by (325/22),\n\n= (55000/484)/(325/22)= (55000/484)*(22/325)= (55000*22)/(484*325),\n\nSimplify:\n\n55000 divided by 484: 55000/484 = 55000 \u00f74 / 121 = 13750/121,\n\nThus,\n\n(13750/121)*(22/325)= (13750*22)/(121*325),\n\n13750 divided by 325: 325\u00d742=13,650, so 13750-13,650=100,\n\nThus 13750=325\u00d742 +100,\n\nHmm, not helpful,\n\nAlternatively, 13750= 125\u00d7110,\n\n325=25\u00d713,\n\n121=11\u00b2,\n\n22=2\u00d711,\n\nThus,\n\n(13750\u00d722)/(121\u00d7325)= (125\u00d7110\u00d72\u00d711)/(11\u00b2\u00d725\u00d713),\n\nSimplify,\n\n125/25=5,\n\n110=11\u00d710,\n\nThus,\n\n(5\u00d711\u00d710\u00d72\u00d711)/(11\u00b2\u00d713)= (5\u00d710\u00d72\u00d711\u00b2)/(11\u00b2\u00d713)= (100)/(13),\n\nThus AP=100/13\u22487.69,\n\nBut then AP=100/13,\n\nBut 100 and13 are coprime, so m+n=113,\n\nBut this contradicts previous result,\n\nHmm, so which is correct?\n\nWait, in this case, if AP=100/13\u22487.69,\n\nBut DA is 325/22\u224814.77,\n\nThen DP=DB\u00b2 / DA= (50625/484)/(325/22)= same as before 2025/286\u22487.08,\n\nThen if AP=DA - DP\u224814.77-7.08\u22487.69,\n\nWhich matches,\n\nBut which is the correct configuration?\n\nThe problem states that AD intersects \u03c9 again at P,\n\nSo starting from A, going along AD, the next intersection with \u03c9 is P,\n\nTherefore, if the line AD starts at A, goes through D (outside), so the other intersection is beyond D from A,\n\nWait no, if you start at A, and go along AD towards D, then you exit the circle at A, so the other intersection must be on the other side of A,\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be,\n\nWait, confusion arises because the line AD starts at A, which is on the circle. So the other intersection P must be on the line AD extended beyond D,\n\nWait, but if D is outside, then the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then P is on the side beyond D from A,\n\nTherefore, AP = AD + DP,\n\nWhich gives the larger value of 3125/143\u224821.85,\n\nBut in this case, the problem says \"AD intersects \u03c9 at P\", meaning the other intersection besides A is P,\n\nSo if you go from A through D, then P must be the second point, so beyond D,\n\nThus AP = AD + DP,\n\nHence the answer should be 3125/143,\n\nTherefore m +n= 3125+143=3268,\n\nBut this seems quite large.
