      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the side length of this convex equilateral hexagon ABCDEF where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the segments AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Hmm, let me try to visualize this first.\n\nSince it's an equilateral hexagon, all its sides are equal in length, which we can call 's'. Also, opposite sides are parallel, so AB is parallel to DE, BC to EF, and CD to FA. The triangle mentioned is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me imagine those lines extended until they meet. The triangle's sides are the extensions of those three sides, so each side of the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. The lengths of the triangle's sides are given as 200, 240, and 300.\n\nI think the key here is to relate the side length of the hexagon to the sides of this triangle. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, maybe there's some symmetry or similarity involved here. Let me try to draw a rough sketch mentally. Let's denote the triangle as triangle XYZ, where the sides XY, YZ, and ZX are formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF respectively. Wait, actually, which sides correspond to which extensions? Let me clarify.\n\nSuppose we extend AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F. The intersections of these extensions form the triangle. The sides of this triangle are the lengths between these intersection points. Since opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon's structure might form a sort of \"star\" shape inside the triangle, with each side of the hexagon cutting off a portion of the triangle's sides.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hexagon is inscribed in some way within the triangle? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think of coordinate geometry. Maybe setting coordinates would help here. Let me try to place the triangle in a coordinate system to model the problem.\n\nLet me consider triangle ABC (but wait, the triangle is named in the problem with different letters). Let me call the triangle's vertices as P, Q, R, formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Let me assign coordinates to these points. Let me pick one side of the triangle as the base for simplicity.\n\nWait, perhaps using vectors or coordinate geometry could be a good approach here. Let me try to set coordinates such that the triangle is in a coordinate system where calculations are easier.\n\nSuppose I place the triangle with side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Let me first determine the coordinates of the triangle. Let me suppose the triangle is triangle PQR with sides PQ=200, QR=240, and RP=300. Wait, but actually, the problem doesn't specify which side corresponds to which extension, so maybe I need to be careful here. Alternatively, perhaps the triangle's sides correspond directly to the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Maybe each side of the triangle is an extension of one of those sides.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, maybe the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to some inner triangle related to the hexagon. Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the extensions of the sides AB, CD, EF must form a triangle whose sides are proportional to the sides of the hexagon?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a relationship where the sides of the triangle are each equal to the sum of certain terms involving the hexagon's side length and the distances between the sides?\n\nWait, since opposite sides are parallel, the distance between each pair of opposite sides is the same? Hmm, not necessarily, but maybe in this case, given the triangle's sides, the distances can be related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the concept of similar triangles. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, when we extend those sides, the intersections form a larger triangle. The hexagon's sides are somehow proportionally related to the sides of this larger triangle.\n\nLet me think of the hexagon as being formed by cutting the triangle's sides with lines parallel to the opposite sides. For example, if we have triangle PQR, and then we cut each side at a certain distance from the vertices, forming a smaller similar triangle inside, but in this case, it's a hexagon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each side of the hexagon is a segment between two such cuts on adjacent sides of the triangle. Since the hexagon is equilateral, those segments must all have the same length.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that the triangle formed by the extensions has sides of length 200, 240, 300, and the hexagon is inscribed in such a way that each of its sides is a part of the sides of the triangle but offset inward. Since opposite sides are parallel, each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel to a pair of sides of the triangle? Hmm, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle? Wait, but the problem says that opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel. Since the triangle's sides are all at different angles, unless the triangle is equilateral, which it isn't, since sides are 200,240,300. So the hexagon's opposite sides must be parallel to each other, but not necessarily to the triangle's sides.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to formalize the problem with coordinates.\n\nLet me set coordinate system such that the triangle formed by the extensions is triangle ABC, with coordinates assigned in a way that makes calculations manageable. Let me suppose that the triangle is formed by lines extended from AB, CD, and EF of the hexagon. Let me denote the triangle's vertices as P, Q, R. Let me choose coordinates so that point P is at (0,0), Q is at (200,0), and R is somewhere in the plane. Wait, but the triangle sides are 200, 240, 300. Let me check if those can form a triangle first.\n\nWait, 200 + 240 > 300 (440 > 300), 200 + 300 > 240, 240 + 300 > 200, so yes, it is a valid triangle.\n\nLet me pick coordinates such that vertex P is at (0,0), vertex Q is at (200,0), and vertex R is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute coordinates of R using the side lengths. Let me denote PQ = 200, QR = 240, PR = 300. Wait, actually, which sides correspond to which lengths?\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that the triangle has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. Let me make sure which sides correspond to which extensions. Since the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF, each side of the triangle is the extension of one of those sides. So each side of the triangle is colinear with one of the hexagon's sides, but extended. Therefore, the side of the triangle opposite to the extension of AB would be the side formed by the intersection of CD and EF extensions, etc. Hmm, perhaps each side of the triangle is formed by two extensions. For example, the side opposite to AB's extension would be the intersection of CD and EF extensions, etc. Maybe it's better to think in terms of lines.\n\nLet me consider the three lines: the lines extended from AB, CD, and EF. These three lines form a triangle. Let me denote these lines as l_AB, l_CD, l_EF. The intersections of these lines form triangle XYZ, with sides of length 200, 240, 300. Now, the hexagon is inside this triangle, with each side lying along a segment between two sides of the triangle?\n\nWait, perhaps each side of the hexagon is between two sides of the triangle? Let me think. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, each pair of opposite sides must be parallel and separated by some distance. The extensions of AB, CD, EF meet at the triangle's vertices, so maybe each side of the hexagon is a segment that connects two adjacent sides of the triangle, but offset inward?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the hexagon as being formed by three pairs of parallel lines. Each pair corresponds to opposite sides of the hexagon, which are parallel and equidistant. The triangle is formed by the three lines that are the extensions of one line from each pair. Since opposite sides are parallel, each pair of opposite sides can be considered as two parallel lines cut by the sides of the triangle. The distance between these lines might relate to the side length of the hexagon.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the distance between each pair of opposite sides must be the same in some proportional way?\n\nWait, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles here. Since the lines forming the triangle are extensions of the hexagon's sides, the hexagon could be similar to the triangle but scaled down, but since it's a hexagon, maybe it's a combination of scaled sections?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem). If the hexagon's sides are cutting the sides of the triangle proportionally, then the side length can be found using ratios.\n\nSuppose that along each side of the triangle, the hexagon's sides are placed such that they divide the triangle's sides into segments. Since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the division must be consistent across all three sides.\n\nLet me denote the triangle as triangle XYZ with sides of length 200, 240, 300. Let me assign variables to the segments. Let me suppose that on each side of the triangle, the hexagon's sides are cutting the triangle's sides into segments of lengths proportional to some ratio.\n\nLet me denote the side lengths of the triangle as a = 200, b = 240, c = 300. Let me suppose that the hexagon is formed by lines parallel to the sides of the triangle, cutting each side of the triangle at certain points. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths between these cuts must be equal.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon has opposite sides parallel, each pair of opposite sides is parallel to a side of the triangle? Wait, if the triangle's sides are each being extended to form the hexagon's sides, maybe each side of the hexagon is parallel to a different side of the triangle?\n\nWait, perhaps each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel to a side of the triangle. For instance, AB and DE are opposite and parallel, so maybe they are parallel to one side of the triangle, and similarly for the other pairs. Hmm, maybe?\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF, then each of those sides of the hexagon are part of the sides of the triangle. So, for example, line AB extended meets line CD extended at a vertex of the triangle, and similarly for the others.\n\nWait, if AB is extended, CD is extended, and EF is extended, their intersection forms the triangle. So each pair of those lines (AB & CD, CD & EF, EF & AB) meet at the triangle's vertices. Wait, actually, each pair of those three lines (AB, CD, EF) would form the three sides of the triangle when extended. Wait, actually, to form a triangle, each side of the triangle is formed by the intersection of two of those extended lines.\n\nWait, let me think again. The problem says \"the triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF\". So the three sides of the triangle are precisely the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. Wait, but a triangle has three sides. So each side of the triangle is the extension of one of those three sides of the hexagon. So, for example, one side of the triangle is the line containing AB extended, another is the line containing CD extended, and the third is the line containing EF extended. Then, these three lines form a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon is situated such that its sides AB, CD, EF are parts of the three sides of this triangle, but the other sides of the hexagon (BC, DE, FA) must be inside the triangle? Hmm, but how exactly?\n\nSince it's a convex hexagon, all its vertices must lie on the sides of the triangle? Wait, perhaps each vertex of the hexagon lies on a side of the triangle. Let me consider labeling the triangle's vertices as P, Q, R, and suppose that the hexagon has vertices A, B, C, D, E, F lying along the sides of the triangle.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let's denote the triangle as triangle PQR, with sides PQ, QR, and RP. The hexagon ABCDEF is inside this triangle such that:\n\n- Side AB is along PQ, but extended beyond to form the side PQ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let's try to think step by step.\n\nEach side of the triangle is an extension of one of the hexagon's sides. So, for instance:\n\n- The side PQ of the triangle is the extension of AB beyond points A and B?\n\nWait, but then AB is a part of PQ. Similarly, QR is the extension of CD beyond C and D, and RP is the extension of EF beyond E and F. Then, the hexagon is formed by the overlapping parts of these lines? Hmm, maybe.\n\nWait, perhaps the hexagon's sides AB, CD, EF are each lying on the sides of the triangle, but the other sides (BC, DE, FA) are inside the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, each pair of opposite sides must be parallel. Since the triangle's sides are each extensions of the hexagon's sides AB, CD, EF, then those three sides of the triangle are each parallel to their corresponding opposite sides in the hexagon?\n\nWait, no. Since AB is part of the triangle's side PQ, then the opposite side of the hexagon, which is DE, should be parallel to AB, so DE is parallel to PQ. Similarly, BC is opposite to EF, so BC is parallel to EF, which is part of side RP of the triangle, so BC is parallel to RP. Similarly, CD is part of QR, so its opposite side FA is parallel to QR.\n\nTherefore, the three sides of the triangle (PQ, QR, RP) are each parallel to a pair of opposite sides of the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the distance between each pair of opposite sides is the same? Hmm, maybe. Alternatively, the length of the hexagon's side can be related to the sides of the triangle through the distances between these parallel lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry. Let me set coordinates such that triangle PQR is convenient. Let me place point P at (0,0), point Q at (200,0), and point R somewhere in the plane. Since the sides are 200, 240, and 300, let me compute coordinates of R.\n\nWait, let me first note that in triangle PQR, let me suppose:\n\n- PQ = 200 (the side opposite vertex R)\n\n- QR = 240 (opposite vertex P)\n\n- PR = 300 (opposite vertex Q)\n\nWait, but depending on labeling. Let me confirm using coordinates.\n\nLet me fix points:\n\nLet\u2019s place point P at (0,0), point Q at (200, 0). Then, we need to find coordinates of R such that PR = 300 and QR = 240. Wait, no, actually, if PQ is 200, then QR would be another side. Let me think:\n\nWait, actually, if PQ is 200, QR is 240, and PR is 300, then coordinates can be found by solving for R.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of R as (x,y). Then, distance from P(0,0) to R(x,y) is 300, so:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 300\u00b2. (1)\n\nDistance from Q(200,0) to R(x,y) is 240, so:\n\n(x - 200)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 240\u00b2. (2)\n\nSubtract equation (1) from (2):\n\n(x - 200)^2 + y^2 - (x^2 + y^2) = 240\u00b2 - 300\u00b2\n\nExpanding (x - 200)^2: x\u00b2 - 400x + 40000\n\nSo subtract x\u00b2 + y\u00b2:\n\n-400x + 40000 = (240\u00b2 - 300\u00b2)\n\nCompute 240\u00b2 = 57600, 300\u00b2=90000, so difference is 57600 - 90000 = -32400\n\nThus:\n\n-400x + 40000 = -32400\n\n-400x = -32400 -40000 = -72400\n\nTherefore x = (-72400)/(-400) = 72400/400 = 181.\n\nWait, 72400 divided by 400: 72400 divided by 400 is 724/4 = 181. So x = 181.\n\nThen, plug x=181 into equation (1):\n\n181\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 300\u00b2\n\nCalculate 181\u00b2: 180\u00b2 + 2*180*1 +1 = 32400 + 360 +1 = 32761\n\nSo y\u00b2 = 90000 - 32761 = 57239\n\nTherefore y = sqrt(57239). Let me see, sqrt(57239). Hmm, 239\u00b2 is 57121, and 240\u00b2 is 57600. So sqrt(57239) is between 239 and 240, approximately 239.25. But maybe exact value is not necessary yet.\n\nSo coordinates of R are (181, sqrt(57239)). Hmm, okay, but maybe this is getting too calculation-heavy. Perhaps there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the distances between each pair of opposite sides must be the same? Wait, but in a parallelogram, opposite sides are equal and parallel, but here it's a hexagon. Maybe the hexagon can be considered as a combination of parallelograms?\n\nAlternatively, using vectors. Let me think of the hexagon in terms of vectors. Let me suppose that each side of the hexagon is a vector of length 's', and since opposite sides are parallel, their vectors are the same. But the problem is how the triangle comes into play.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the triangle formed by the extensions has sides of 200, 240, 300. The hexagon is inscribed in such a way that each side is part of the triangle's sides. Since the hexagon's sides are all length s, perhaps the sides of the triangle can be expressed in terms of s and the distances between the sides?\n\nWait, perhaps the triangle's sides are divided by the hexagon's vertices into segments. Let me suppose that on each side of the triangle, the hexagon's vertices divide the side into two parts. Let me suppose that on side PQ (length 200), which is the extension of AB, the points A and B are located such that PA = a, AQ = b, so PA + AB + BQ = PQ? Wait, maybe not exactly. Wait, actually, since AB is part of PQ, the side AB is a segment on PQ. Let me think again.\n\nLet me suppose that the triangle has sides PQ, QR, RP of lengths 200, 240, 300. The hexagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. The sides AB, CD, EF are parts of the triangle's sides PQ, QR, RP respectively. Since opposite sides are parallel, DE is parallel to AB (which is on PQ), so DE must also be parallel to PQ. Similarly, FA is parallel to CD (on QR), so FA is parallel to QR, and BC is parallel to EF (on RP), so BC is parallel to RP.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon's sides are arranged such that each pair of opposite sides is parallel to a side of the triangle, and each pair is placed along the corresponding triangle side.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon is formed by three pairs of parallel lines, each pair parallel to a side of the triangle and cutting the other sides proportionally.\n\nLet me try to model this with coordinates. Let me use barycentric coordinates or something similar. Alternatively, use affine coordinates.\n\nLet me consider the triangle PQR with coordinates as before. Let me denote the sides:\n\n- PQ is the side from (0,0) to (200,0).\n\n- QR is from (200,0) to (181, sqrt(57239)).\n\n- RP is from (181, sqrt(57239)) back to (0,0).\n\nNow, the hexagon's side AB is along PQ. Let me denote point A as somewhere between P and B on PQ, and point B is further along PQ. Wait, actually, since AB is part of PQ, then AB is a segment on PQ. Let me denote the positions of A and B on PQ such that AB has length s. Similarly, CD is a segment on QR with length s, and EF is a segment on RP with length s.\n\nBut since the hexagon is convex and the other sides must connect these, the other vertices C, D, E, F must lie on QR, RP, and back to PQ? Hmm, this might need more precise analysis.\n\nAlternatively, since DE is parallel to AB (which is on PQ), DE must be a segment parallel to PQ. Since DE is opposite to AB, it should be on the side opposite, which would be the side QR or RP? Wait, maybe not. Since DE is opposite to AB, which is on PQ, then DE must be parallel to PQ and located on the opposite side of the triangle. Wait, but in a triangle, the opposite side would be QR or RP?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hexagon is such that each pair of opposite sides lies on different sides of the triangle. Let me think step by step.\n\nSuppose side AB is along PQ. Then the opposite side DE must be parallel to PQ. Since DE is part of the hexagon, which is convex, DE must be somewhere inside the triangle but parallel to PQ. Similarly, CD is along QR, so opposite side FA is parallel to QR, and EF is along RP, so opposite side BC is parallel to RP.\n\nTherefore, each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle, and one of the sides of the hexagon lies along each side of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon is formed by three sides lying on the triangle's sides, and three other sides parallel to those, forming a closed figure.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon can be thought of as a \"shrunken\" version of the triangle, with each side of the triangle having a side of the hexagon along it, and the opposite side of the hexagon parallel to it, offset inward.\n\nThis sounds similar to a hexagon formed by lines drawn parallel to the sides of the triangle at some distance from them, cutting the sides of the triangle. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the distances must be set so that all the sides of the hexagon are equal.\n\nThis might be a case where the hexagon is related to the triangle through similar triangles and proportions.\n\nLet me consider that each side of the hexagon is a segment between two lines parallel to the sides of the triangle. Let me denote the triangle as ABC (changing notation for simplicity), with sides of length a, b, c. Let me use standard triangle notation where side a is BC, side b is AC, and side c is AB. Wait, but in our case, the triangle sides are 200, 240, 300. Maybe assigning them as follows:\n\nLet me denote the triangle as PQR with PQ = 200, QR = 240, and RP = 300. Let me define the hexagon such that:\n\n- Side AB is along PQ from point A to point B.\n\n- Side CD is along QR from point C to point D.\n\n- Side EF is along RP from point E to point F.\n\nOpposite sides DE, FA, and BC are parallel to PQ, QR, and RP respectively.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, all its sides (AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA) have the same length s.\n\nNow, to find s in terms of the triangle sides.\n\nLet me consider the lines parallel to the sides of the triangle. For instance, the side DE is parallel to PQ and lies somewhere inside the triangle. Similarly, FA is parallel to QR and BC is parallel to RP.\n\nBecause of the parallelism, the segments DE, FA, BC form lines that are parallel to the triangle's sides and intersect the other sides.\n\nThe key idea is that the hexagon's sides divide the triangle's sides proportionally. Let me denote the ratios of division on each side.\n\nLet me suppose that on side PQ (length 200), the segment AB has length s. Let me denote the distance from P to A as x, so PA = x, then AB = s implies that PB = x + s. Since PQ is 200, the remaining segment from B to Q would be 200 - (x + s). Similarly, but this might get too convoluted. Maybe using mass point or similar triangles.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the lines DE (parallel to PQ) and FA (parallel to QR) intersect at some point, forming the vertex D, etc. This might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, think of homothety. The hexagon might be a homothetic figure of the triangle scaled down by some factor. Since it's equilateral, maybe the scaling factors along each side are related to the side length s.\n\nAlternatively, use area ratios. But since we need a length, maybe we can set up equations based on proportions.\n\nLet me consider the three sides of the triangle and how the hexagon's sides cut them.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nOn side PQ (length 200), the hexagon has side AB with length s. Let me let PA = a, so AQ = 200 - a - s (since AB is between A and B). Wait, actually, if AB is along PQ, then PA + AB + BQ = PQ? Wait, no, because in the triangle, the side PQ is from P to Q, so if A is between P and Q, and B is also between P and Q, then PA + AB + BQ = PQ. So if PA = x, then AB = s, so BQ = 200 - x - s. But the other sides of the hexagon must connect back.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hexagon is such that each vertex is on a different side of the triangle. Wait, the hexagon has six vertices, so each vertex is on a side of the triangle? Since the triangle has three sides, each side of the triangle must contain two vertices of the hexagon.\n\nAh! That must be it. Each side of the triangle has two vertices of the hexagon. For example, side PQ of the triangle has points A and B, side QR has points C and D, and side RP has points E and F. Thus, the hexagon is inscribed in the triangle with two vertices on each side.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon's sides AB, CD, EF lie on the triangle's sides PQ, QR, RP respectively, and the other sides BC, DE, FA connect the vertices across the triangle's sides.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, all sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA are equal to s.\n\nMoreover, opposite sides are parallel:\n\n- AB is on PQ, so DE must be parallel to PQ.\n\n- CD is on QR, so FA must be parallel to QR.\n\n- EF is on RP, so BC must be parallel to RP.\n\nTherefore, DE is parallel to PQ, FA parallel to QR, BC parallel to RP.\n\nTherefore, the lines DE, FA, BC are each parallel to a side of the triangle and pass through two vertices of the hexagon not on that side.\n\nThis seems manageable. Let me try to model this with coordinates.\n\nLet me place triangle PQR with coordinates as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s set point P at (0, 0), Q at (200, 0), and R at (coordinates computed earlier). Let me compute coordinates of R again for accuracy.\n\nEarlier, with PQ = 200, QR = 240, PR = 300:\n\nCoordinates of R are (181, sqrt(300\u00b2 - 181\u00b2)).\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, in coordinate system with P(0,0), Q(200,0), R(x,y):\n\nDistance PR = 300: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 300\u00b2\n\nDistance QR = 240: (x - 200)^2 + y\u00b2 = 240\u00b2\n\nSubtract equations:\n\n(x - 200)^2 - x\u00b2 = 240\u00b2 - 300\u00b2\n\nExpand left side: x\u00b2 - 400x + 40000 - x\u00b2 = -400x + 40000\n\nRight side: (240 - 300)(240 + 300) = (-60)(540) = -32400\n\nThus:\n\n-400x + 40000 = -32400\n\n-400x = -72400\n\nx = 72400 / 400 = 181. So x=181.\n\nThen y\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 - 181\u00b2 = 90000 - (180+1)^2 = 90000 - (32400 + 360 +1) = 90000 - 32761 = 57239\n\nSo y = sqrt(57239). Let me see if that simplifies. 57239 divided by 7? 7*8177=57239? 7*8000=56000, 7*177=1239, total 56000+1239=57239. Yes, so sqrt(57239)=sqrt(7*8177). Hmm, maybe 8177 divisible by 7? 7*1168=8176, so no. So it's irrational. Let me just keep it as sqrt(57239) for now.\n\nTherefore, coordinates are:\n\nP(0,0), Q(200, 0), R(181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nNow, the hexagon has vertices A and B on PQ, C and D on QR, E and F on RP.\n\nLet me parameterize the positions:\n\nLet me denote the position of point A on PQ as a fraction along PQ. Let me define parameters for each side.\n\nLet me let:\n\nOn side PQ (from P(0,0) to Q(200,0)):\n\n- Let point A divide PQ into PA = t * PQ, so PA = t * 200, so coordinates of A are (200t, 0).\n\n- Then point B is further along PQ, so AB = s. Since PQ is horizontal, moving along x-axis, so B is at (200t + s, 0). The distance from A to B is s, so that's straightforward.\n\nWait, but PQ is length 200, so coordinates of B can't exceed 200. So 200t + s \u2264 200. Similarly, the other end?\n\nWait, but actually, since the hexagon is convex and the other vertices are on other sides, perhaps the points are placed such that they don't go beyond the triangle. Let me think.\n\nSimilarly, on QR (from Q(200,0) to R(181, sqrt(57239))):\n\nLet me parameterize QR. Let me denote point C as a point along QR, and D as another point further along QR such that CD = s and CD is along QR. Wait, but QR has length 240. Wait, but QR is a side of the triangle, so QR is from Q(200,0) to R(181, sqrt(57239)), which has length 240.\n\nWait, the coordinates of R are (181, sqrt(57239)), so QR vector is (181-200, sqrt(57239) - 0) = (-19, sqrt(57239)). The length of QR is 240, so that's consistent.\n\nSimilarly, the parametric equation for QR can be written as Q + k*(vector QR), where k ranges from 0 to 1.\n\nLet me denote point C as Q + k*(QR vector), so coordinates of C would be (200 -19k, 0 + sqrt(57239)*k). Similarly, point D is further along QR, so at k + m, but need to ensure CD length is s. Hmm, perhaps using parameters for each side.\n\nAlternatively, let me parameterize each side with a parameter between 0 and 1.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nOn PQ:\n\n- Point A is at a distance of \u03b1 * PQ from P, so coordinates (200\u03b1, 0).\n\n- Then point B is at a distance \u03b1*PQ + s from P, so coordinates (200\u03b1 + s, 0). Since PQ is 200, we have 200\u03b1 + s \u2264 200 \u21d2 \u03b1 \u2264 (200 - s)/200.\n\nOn QR:\n\n- QR has length 240. Let me denote point C as being \u03b2 * QR from Q. So since QR is from Q to R, the coordinates would be Q + \u03b2*(R - Q). The vector R - Q is (181 - 200, sqrt(57239) - 0) = (-19, sqrt(57239)). So coordinates of C are (200 -19\u03b2, sqrt(57239)*\u03b2).\n\nSimilarly, point D is further along QR, so at \u03b2 + \u03b3, but such that the length CD is s. The length from C to D along QR is \u03b3 * 240, so \u03b3 = s / 240. Wait, but QR's total length is 240, so moving a fraction of s/240 along QR from C would give D. Therefore, coordinates of D would be (200 -19(\u03b2 + s/240), sqrt(57239)*(\u03b2 + s/240)).\n\nOn RP:\n\n- RP goes from R(181, sqrt(57239)) back to P(0,0). Let me parameterize this side. Let me denote point E as being \u03b3 * RP from R. Wait, maybe using similar parameters. Let me instead parameterize from P to R, but since RP is from R to P, let me think.\n\nThe length of RP is 300. Let me denote point E as being \u03b4 * RP from R towards P. So coordinates of E would be R + \u03b4*(P - R) = (181 - 181\u03b4, sqrt(57239) - sqrt(57239)*\u03b4) = (181(1 - \u03b4), sqrt(57239)(1 - \u03b4)).\n\nThen point F is further along RP from E by a distance s, so moving a fraction of s/300 along RP from E. Thus, coordinates of F would be E plus (s/300)*(vector RP). The vector from R to P is (-181, -sqrt(57239)), so per unit length, it's (-181/300, -sqrt(57239)/300). Therefore, moving s/300 from E:\n\nF_x = 181(1 - \u03b4) - 181*(s/300)\n\nF_y = sqrt(57239)(1 - \u03b4) - sqrt(57239)*(s/300)\n\n= sqrt(57239)*(1 - \u03b4 - s/300)\n\nHmm, this is getting very involved with multiple parameters. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon sides BC, DE, FA are parallel to the triangle sides QR, RP, PQ respectively, we can use the property of parallel lines and similar triangles to set up equations.\n\nLet me consider side BC, which is between point B on PQ and point C on QR, and BC is parallel to RP.\n\nSince BC is parallel to RP, the direction vector of BC should be the same as RP.\n\nThe vector RP is P - R = (-181, -sqrt(57239)). So direction vector (-181, -sqrt(57239)).\n\nThe vector BC is C - B. Let me compute coordinates of B and C.\n\nPoint B is on PQ at (200\u03b1 + s, 0).\n\nPoint C is on QR at (200 -19\u03b2, sqrt(57239)\u03b2).\n\nSo vector BC is (200 -19\u03b2 - (200\u03b1 + s), sqrt(57239)\u03b2 - 0).\n\nThis vector must be a scalar multiple of the direction vector of RP, which is (-181, -sqrt(57239)). Therefore,\n\n(200 -19\u03b2 -200\u03b1 -s, sqrt(57239)\u03b2) = k*(-181, -sqrt(57239))\n\nTherefore, equating components:\n\n200 -19\u03b2 -200\u03b1 -s = -181k (1)\n\nsqrt(57239)\u03b2 = -sqrt(57239)k (2)\n\nFrom equation (2):\n\nsqrt(57239)\u03b2 = -sqrt(57239)k \u21d2 \u03b2 = -k. Since \u03b2 is a fraction along QR from Q, which is between 0 and 1, k must be negative. Let me write k = -m where m is positive. Then \u03b2 = m.\n\nSubstituting into equation (1):\n\n200 -19m -200\u03b1 -s = -181*(-m) \u21d2 200 -19m -200\u03b1 -s = 181m\n\nRearranged:\n\n200 -200\u03b1 -s = 181m +19m = 200m\n\nThus,\n\n200(1 - \u03b1) - s = 200m \u21d2 m = (200(1 - \u03b1) - s)/200\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nNow, moving on to another pair. Let's look at side DE, which is parallel to PQ. DE connects D (on QR) to E (on RP). Since DE is parallel to PQ, which is along the x-axis, DE must be horizontal (since PQ is the x-axis from (0,0) to (200,0)). So the y-coordinate of D and E must be the same.\n\nCoordinates of D: as above, D is along QR beyond C by s/240 fraction. Wait, earlier I considered moving along QR from C by s/240? Wait, QR's length is 240, so moving a distance s along QR from C would correspond to a parameter increase of s/240. So if point C is at \u03b2, then D is at \u03b2 + s/240. Wait, but QR is from Q to R, so moving from C towards R.\n\nWait, let me clarify parameters again. Let me instead use parameters for position along each side as fractions from the starting vertex.\n\nLet me re-define:\n\nOn PQ: from P to Q, let point A be at fraction t from P, so PA = t*200, coordinates (200t, 0). Then AB has length s, so point B is at t + s/200 along PQ? Wait, no, because PQ is 200 units long, so moving s units from A along PQ would require s/200 of the length. Wait, actually, the distance along PQ from A to B is s, so since PQ is along x-axis, the coordinate difference is s. So if A is at x = 200t, then B is at x = 200t + s, so the fraction along PQ is (200t + s)/200 = t + s/200. Therefore, parameter for B is t + s/200.\n\nSimilarly, on QR: which is from Q to R, length 240. Let me let point C be at fraction u from Q, so QC = u*240. Coordinates of C would be Q + u*(QR vector). QR vector is (-19, sqrt(57239)), so coordinates of C: (200 -19u, sqrt(57239)*u). Then CD is length s along QR, so point D is at u + s/240 fraction from Q. So D's coordinates are (200 -19(u + s/240), sqrt(57239)*(u + s/240)).\n\nOn RP: from R to P, length 300. Let me let point E be at fraction v from R, so RE = v*300. Coordinates of E = R + v*(P - R) = (181 -181v, sqrt(57239) - sqrt(57239)v). Then EF is length s along RP towards P, so point F is at v + s/300 fraction from R, coordinates (181 -181(v + s/300), sqrt(57239) - sqrt(57239)(v + s/300)).\n\nNow, the hexagon is A-B-C-D-E-F-A. We have to ensure that the sides BC, DE, FA are also of length s and are parallel to their respective triangle sides.\n\nStarting with BC parallel to RP.\n\nVector BC = C - B.\n\nCoordinates:\n\nB is (200t + s, 0)\n\nC is (200 -19u, sqrt(57239)u)\n\nThus, vector BC = (200 -19u - (200t + s), sqrt(57239)u - 0) = (200(1 - t) -19u - s, sqrt(57239)u)\n\nThis must be parallel to RP, whose direction vector is P - R = (-181, -sqrt(57239)). So the vector BC must be a scalar multiple of (-181, -sqrt(57239)).\n\nThus,\n\n(200(1 - t) -19u - s, sqrt(57239)u) = k*(-181, -sqrt(57239))\n\nTherefore,\n\n200(1 - t) -19u - s = -181k (1)\n\nsqrt(57239)u = -sqrt(57239)k \u21d2 u = -k (2)\n\nFrom equation (2): u = -k \u21d2 k = -u.\n\nSubstitute into equation (1):\n\n200(1 - t) -19u - s = -181*(-u) \u21d2 200(1 - t) -19u - s = 181u\n\nRearranged:\n\n200(1 - t) - s = 181u +19u \u21d2 200(1 - t) - s = 200u \u21d2 200(1 - t - u) = s \u21d2 1 - t - u = s/200 (Equation A)\n\nNext, consider DE parallel to PQ (which is along x-axis). DE connects D to E, so vector DE must be horizontal (since PQ is horizontal). Therefore, the y-coordinate of D and E must be equal.\n\nCoordinates of D: (200 -19(u + s/240), sqrt(57239)*(u + s/240))\n\nCoordinates of E: (181 -181v, sqrt(57239)(1 - v))\n\nThus, their y-coordinates must be equal:\n\nsqrt(57239)*(u + s/240) = sqrt(57239)*(1 - v)\n\nCancel sqrt(57239):\n\nu + s/240 = 1 - v \u21d2 v = 1 - u - s/240 (Equation B)\n\nAlso, the length DE must be s. Since DE is horizontal, the difference in x-coordinates is s, so:\n\nE_x - D_x = s (since they are horizontal and DE is from D to E, assuming the direction)\n\nWait, need to check the direction. Since D is on QR and E is on RP, the x-coordinate of E could be less than D's x-coordinate. Let me compute:\n\nE_x = 181 - 181v\n\nD_x = 200 -19(u + s/240)\n\nThus,\n\nE_x - D_x = [181 -181v] - [200 -19(u + s/240)] = 181 -181v -200 +19u +19s/240\n\n= (181 - 200) + 19u +19s/240 -181v\n\n= -19 +19u +19s/240 -181v\n\nThis must equal \u00b1s, depending on direction. Since DE is part of the hexagon, which is convex, likely direction is such that E is to the left of D, so E_x - D_x = -s.\n\nWait, perhaps better to just set the absolute value as s, but direction matters. Let me see:\n\nThe length of DE is s, so:\n\nsqrt( (E_x - D_x)^2 + (E_y - D_y)^2 ) = s\n\nBut since DE is parallel to PQ (horizontal), the y difference is zero, so:\n\n|E_x - D_x| = s\n\nTherefore,\n\nE_x - D_x = \u00b1s.\n\nAssuming the hexagon is oriented such that moving from D to E goes towards the left (since E is on RP which goes back towards P), so E_x < D_x, so E_x - D_x = -s.\n\nThus,\n\n-19 +19u +19s/240 -181v = -s\n\nLet me substitute v from Equation B: v =1 - u - s/240\n\nPlugging into above equation:\n\n-19 +19u +19s/240 -181*(1 - u - s/240) = -s\n\nExpand the terms:\n\n-19 +19u +19s/240 -181 +181u +181*(s/240) = -s\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(-19 -181) + (19u +181u) + (19s/240 +181s/240) = -s\n\nCalculates to:\n\n-200 + 200u + (200s)/240 = -s\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n200s/240 = (5s)/6\n\nThus:\n\n-200 + 200u + (5s)/6 = -s\n\nBring all terms to left side except constants:\n\n200u + (5s)/6 +s = 200\n\nCombine s terms:\n\n(5s)/6 + (6s)/6 = (11s)/6\n\nThus,\n\n200u + (11s)/6 = 200 \u21d2 200u = 200 - (11s)/6 \u21d2 u = 1 - (11s)/(6*200) = 1 - (11s)/1200 (Equation C)\n\nNow, moving on to the next condition: FA parallel to QR.\n\nFA connects F to A. FA must be parallel to QR's direction.\n\nQR's direction vector is from Q to R: (-19, sqrt(57239))\n\nVector FA is A - F (since it's from F to A, but direction matters for parallelism).\n\nCoordinates:\n\nF is on RP, which we defined as:\n\nF_x = 181 -181*(v + s/300)\n\nWait, earlier, F is at v + s/300 fraction from R. Wait, let me recall:\n\nE is at fraction v from R, so F is at v + s/300 from R, so coordinates:\n\nF_x = 181 -181*(v + s/300)\n\nF_y = sqrt(57239)*(1 - (v + s/300))\n\nPoint A is at (200t, 0)\n\nThus, vector FA is A - F = (200t - F_x, 0 - F_y)\n\nThis must be a scalar multiple of QR's direction vector (-19, sqrt(57239))\n\nTherefore,\n\n(200t - F_x, -F_y) = k*(-19, sqrt(57239))\n\nThus,\n\n200t - F_x = -19k (3)\n\n-F_y = k*sqrt(57239) \u21d2 k = -F_y / sqrt(57239) (4)\n\nSubstitute F_x and F_y:\n\nF_x = 181 -181(v + s/300)\n\nF_y = sqrt(57239)*(1 - v - s/300)\n\nTherefore,\n\nEquation (3):\n\n200t - [181 -181(v + s/300)] = -19k\n\nEquation (4):\n\nk = - [sqrt(57239)*(1 - v - s/300)] / sqrt(57239) = - (1 - v - s/300 )\n\nPlugging k into equation (3):\n\n200t - 181 +181(v + s/300) = -19*(- (1 - v - s/300))\n\nSimplify RHS:\n\n-19*(-1 + v + s/300) = 19*(1 - v - s/300)\n\nThus,\n\n200t -181 +181v +181*(s/300) = 19 -19v -19*(s/300)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n200t -181 +181v + (181/300)s -19 +19v + (19/300)s =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n200t - (181+19) + (181v +19v) + [ (181 +19)/300 ] s =0\n\nCalculate each part:\n\n200t - 200 + 200v + (200/300)s =0\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\n200/300 = 2/3\n\nThus,\n\n200t +200v + (2/3)s = 200 \u21d2 Divide both sides by 200:\n\nt + v + (2/300)s =1 \u21d2 t + v + (s)/150 =1 (Equation D)\n\nNow, we have equations A, B, C, D:\n\nEquation A: 1 - t - u = s/200\n\nEquation B: v =1 - u - s/240\n\nEquation C: u =1 - (11s)/1200\n\nEquation D: t + v + s/150 =1\n\nOur variables are t, u, v, s. We need to solve for s.\n\nLet me substitute Equation C into Equation A:\n\nFrom Equation C: u =1 - (11s)/1200\n\nPlug into Equation A:\n\n1 - t - [1 - (11s)/1200] = s/200 \u21d2 1 - t -1 + (11s)/1200 = s/200 \u21d2 -t + (11s)/1200 = s/200\n\nSolve for t:\n\n-t = s/200 - (11s)/1200 = (6s -11s)/1200 = (-5s)/1200 \u21d2 t = (5s)/1200 = s/240 (Equation E)\n\nNow, substitute Equation C into Equation B:\n\nv =1 - [1 - (11s)/1200] - s/240 \u21d2 v =1 -1 + (11s)/1200 - s/240 \u21d2 v = (11s)/1200 - (5s)/1200 = (6s)/1200 = s/200 (Equation F)\n\nNow, substitute t = s/240 and v = s/200 into Equation D:\n\n(s/240) + (s/200) + (s)/150 =1\n\nLet me compute each term with common denominator. Let's use 1200 as common denominator:\n\ns/240 = 5s/1200,\n\ns/200 =6s/1200,\n\ns/150 =8s/1200.\n\nThus:\n\n5s/1200 +6s/1200 +8s/1200 =1 \u21d2 (19s)/1200 =1 \u21d2 19s =1200 \u21d2 s=1200/19 \u224863.157... Hmm, but the problem states the triangle sides are 200,240,300, so the hexagon side is 1200/19? Let me check the calculations.\n\nWait, let me verify the substitution into Equation D:\n\nEquation D: t + v + s/150 =1\n\nt = s/240,\n\nv = s/200,\n\nThus,\n\ns/240 + s/200 + s/150 = ?\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 1200:\n\ns/240 = 5s/1200,\n\ns/200 =6s/1200,\n\ns/150 =8s/1200,\n\nTotal:5s +6s +8s =19s over 1200,\n\nThus 19s/1200 =1 \u21d2 s=1200/19. Hmm, so 1200 divided by 19 is indeed approximately 63.15789...\n\nBut the problem states to find the side length of the hexagon, which is an integer, perhaps? The given triangle sides are all integers, so maybe 1200/19 reduces to a fraction, but 19 is a prime, so it won't reduce. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equations.\n\nLet me retrace the steps to see where an error might be.\n\nStarting from Equation D:\n\nAfter substituting t = s/240 and v = s/200,\n\nEquation D: (s/240) + (s/200) + (s/150) =1.\n\nConvert to common denominator 1200:\n\ns/240 = 5s/1200,\n\ns/200 =6s/1200,\n\ns/150= 8s/1200,\n\nTotal: 5+6+8=19 \u21d2 19s/1200 =1 \u21d2 s=1200/19.\n\nHmm, that seems correct. But 1200/19 is about 63.16, which is not an integer, but the problem doesn't specify the side has to be an integer, but the given triangle sides are integers. Maybe I messed up in setting up equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a miscalculation in one of the earlier equations.\n\nLooking back at Equation C:\n\nFrom the DE parallel condition, after substituting v into the equation, we obtained:\n\n-19 +19u +19s/240 -181v = -s\n\nThen substituting v from Equation B (v =1 - u - s/240):\n\nPlugging in:\n\n-19 +19u +19s/240 -181*(1 - u - s/240) = -s\n\nExpand the -181*(...) term:\n\n-181*1 +181u +181*(s/240)\n\nSo total terms:\n\n-19 +19u +19s/240 -181 +181u + (181/240)s = -s\n\nCombine constants: -19 -181 = -200\n\nCombine u terms:19u +181u =200u\n\nCombine s terms: (19/240 +181/240)s = (200/240)s = (5/6)s\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n-200 +200u + (5/6)s = -s \u21d2\n\n200u + (5/6)s +s =200 \u21d2 200u + (11/6)s =200 \u21d2\n\n200u =200 - (11/6)s \u21d2 u =1 - (11/(6*200))s \u21d2 u =1 - (11/1200)s. Which is what I had before. So Equation C is correct.\n\nEquation B was v=1 -u -s/240.\n\nEquation A was from BC parallel to RP, leading to 1 -t -u =s/200.\n\nThen substituting u from Equation C into Equation A:\n\n1 - t - [1 - (11/1200)s] = s/200 \u21d2\n\n1 -t -1 + (11/1200)s = s/200 \u21d2\n\n-t + (11/1200)s = s/200 \u21d2\n\n-t = s/200 -11s/1200 = (6s -11s)/1200= (-5s)/1200 \u21d2\n\nt = (5s)/1200 = s/240. Correct.\n\nEquation D comes from FA parallel to QR condition, leading to t + v + s/150=1.\n\nWith t = s/240 and v = s/200,\n\nThen,\n\ns/240 + s/200 + s/150 = ?\n\nConvert to 1200 denominator:\n\ns/240 =5s/1200,\n\ns/200=6s/1200,\n\ns/150=8s/1200,\n\nTotal: (5+6+8)s/1200=19s/1200 \u21d2 19s =1200 \u21d2 s=1200/19 \u224863.157.\n\nHmm, so unless there's a miscalculation here, this is the result. But the problem says \"Find the side length of the hexagon\". Maybe it is 1200/19, but the problem might expect an integer. Perhaps I made an error in the direction of vectors or in the parametrization.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle sides are assigned differently. I assumed PQ is 200, QR is240, PR is300. Maybe the correspondence of the triangle sides to the extensions is different.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF\". So each side of the triangle is the extension of one of these segments. So perhaps the triangle's sides correspond to AB extended, CD extended, EF extended, but in a cyclic manner?\n\nWait, perhaps PQ is the extension of AB, QR is extension of CD, and RP is extension of EF. Then the side lengths correspond accordingly. But in my coordinate system, I assigned PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300, so that would mean the extension of AB corresponds to the side of length 200, CD to 240, and EF to 300. Maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle is labeled such that the sides opposite to the extensions are the given lengths. Wait, but in any case, following the math, the result is s=1200/19, which is approximately 63.16. Since the problem might require an exact value, 1200 divided by 19 is indeed the fractional form. However, let me check if 1200/19 reduces or if I made a mistake in calculations.\n\nWait, 19*63 = 1197, 1200-1197=3, so 1200/19 =63 + 3/19, which is approximately 63.157. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose that the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF has sides 200,240,300. Let me consider that the hexagon's sides are each a portion of those triangle sides, but the distances between the sides are proportional.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, the distance between each pair of opposite sides is the same. Let me denote the distance between AB and DE as h, between BC and EF as k, and between CD and FA as l. However, since the triangle is formed by the extensions, these distances might relate to the triangle's dimensions.\n\nAlternatively, using trilinear coordinates or area ratios.\n\nAlternatively, the key formula for an equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel inscribed in a triangle: perhaps the side length is (a*b*c)^(1/3) or something, but that might not be.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem involves a triangle with sides 200,240,300 and the hexagon's sides are proportional, maybe the side length s is given by (200*240*300)^(1/3) but that would be cube root of 14,400,000 \u2248 243, which is not likely.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula from similar triangles: if the hexagon divides each side of the triangle into segments proportional to (s, 200 -s) etc., but the earlier equation gives s=1200/19, which is approximately 63.16. Let me see if that's an acceptable answer, even if fractional.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the side length of the hexagon\", and doesn't specify it must be integer. So maybe 1200/19 is the answer. But the problem might want it as a fraction, but in the box, they usually want integers. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the sign when setting up the equations for vector BC.\n\nLooking back at vector BC parallel to RP:\n\nWe had coordinates of B as (200t + s, 0) and C as (200 -19u, sqrt(57239)u). Then vector BC is (200 -19u - (200t + s), sqrt(57239)u -0). This should be a scalar multiple of the direction vector of RP, which is P - R = (-181, -sqrt(57239)). So vector BC should be a positive multiple? Or negative?\n\nWait, direction matters. Suppose the scalar multiple is negative, so that the direction is opposite to RP. Let me re-express:\n\nVector BC = k*(-181, -sqrt(57239))\n\nSo components:\n\nx-component: 200 -19u -200t -s = -181k\n\ny-component: sqrt(57239)u = -sqrt(57239)k \u21d2 u = -k \u21d2 k = -u\n\nTherefore substituting back:\n\n200 -19u -200t -s = -181*(-u) \u21d2 200 -19u -200t -s = 181u \u21d2 200 -200t -s = 200u \u21d2 1 - t - s/200 = u. Wait, wait, let me divide both sides by 200:\n\n(200 -200t -s)/200 = u \u21d2 1 - t - s/200 =u. So this is Equation A: 1 - t -u = s/200 \u21d2 which is what I had before. So that is correct.\n\nHmm, so calculations seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different approach leading to an integer answer.\n\nLet me think of the problem in terms of similar triangles.\n\nSuppose that the hexagon divides each side of the triangle into two parts. Let the side of the triangle be divided into segments of length x and (L -x), where L is the length of the side.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, the length s of its sides can be related through the divisions on each side of the triangle.\n\nAssuming that the divisions are proportional, so that the ratios are the same on each side.\n\nLet me denote that on each side of the triangle, the hexagon's side divides the triangle's side into segments proportional to some ratio.\n\nSuppose that on each side of the triangle, the hexagon's side is a fraction k of the triangle's side. Wait, but since the hexagon has three sides on the triangle's sides, each of length s, then s = k*L_i, where L_i is the length of the triangle's side.\n\nBut since the hexagon is equilateral, all s must be equal, so k*L1 = k*L2 = k*L3, implying that all sides of the triangle are equal, which they're not. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, the division is such that the ratios are consistent.\n\nLet me suppose that on side PQ (length 200), the segment AB is of length s, and divides PQ into parts of length a and b, so a + s + b = 200. Similarly, on QR (240), CD divides it into parts c + s + d =240, and on RP (300), EF divides it into e + s + f =300.\n\nBut the other sides of the hexagon (BC, DE, FA) must connect these points with length s and parallel to the other sides.\n\nThis seems similar to the previous approach but perhaps thinking in terms of ratios.\n\nAlternatively, the key idea is that in such a configuration, the side length s of the hexagon is equal to (2*Area of triangle)/(sum of the triangle sides). But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept that in a triangle, if three lines are drawn parallel to the sides, forming a smaller similar triangle inside, the ratio of similarity can be related to the side lengths. But in this case, it's a hexagon, not a triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side length s is related to the inradius or something else, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon's opposite sides are parallel and it's equilateral, the distance between each pair of opposite sides must be the same. The distance between two parallel lines can be calculated if we know the equations of the lines.\n\nAssume the three sides of the triangle are the lines containing AB, CD, EF. Let me denote the three lines as L1 (AB's line), L2 (CD's line), L3 (EF's line). The hexagon lies between these lines and their parallels.\n\nThe distance between L1 and its opposite side (DE) must be equal to the distance between L2 and FA, and between L3 and BC.\n\nThe distance between two parallel lines ax + by + c =0 and ax + by + d =0 is |c - d| / sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). So if I can find the equations of the lines and set the distances appropriately, maybe I can solve for s.\n\nHowever, this might require knowing the equations of all lines, which would involve the coordinates again.\n\nAlternatively, in my earlier coordinate system, the distance between AB (on PQ) and DE (parallel to PQ) can be computed. Since DE is parallel to PQ (which is the x-axis), the y-coordinate of DE is the distance between the lines.\n\nSince DE is a horizontal line at some y-coordinate, and PQ is at y=0, the vertical distance between them is the y-coordinate of DE.\n\nSimilarly, the distance between CD (on QR) and FA (parallel to QR) would require computing the distance between those two lines.\n\nBut this might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, in my previous equations, the answer came out to 1200/19, which is approximately 63.16. Given that the problem is from a competition, perhaps the answer is 120, but that might not fit. Alternatively, check the equations again.\n\nWait, let me recheck the calculation for Equation D:\n\nAfter substitution:\n\nt + v + s/150 =1,\n\nwith t = s/240 and v = s/200,\n\nthen,\n\ns/240 + s/200 + s/150 = ?\n\nConvert to 1200 denominator:\n\ns/240 =5s/1200,\n\ns/200 =6s/1200,\n\ns/150=8s/1200,\n\nTotal: (5+6+8)s /1200 =19s/1200=1 \u21d2 s=1200/19.\n\nWait, this is correct. So unless the problem has a different configuration, this is the answer. Maybe the problem expects an exact fraction, so 1200 divided by 19 is the answer, but written as a boxed number. Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the correspondence of the triangle sides.\n\nWait, in my coordinate system, I assumed PQ is the side between P(0,0) and Q(200,0), QR is between Q(200,0) and R(181, sqrt(57239)), and RP is between R and P.\n\nBut the problem states that the triangle has side lengths 200,240,300. In my setup, PQ is 200, QR is240, RP is300. That's correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle is labeled differently such that the side opposite to the extension of AB is 200, etc., but I followed the given lengths.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side lengths of the triangle are assigned differently. Let me try swapping sides to see if that leads to an integer.\n\nSuppose that instead of PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300, we assign:\n\nSuppose PQ corresponds to 240, QR to 300, RP to200. Then, re-do the equations.\n\nBut this might take a lot of time. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula.\n\nWait, let me think of the problem in terms of the reciprocal of the side lengths.\n\nSuppose that the side length s of the hexagon is related to the triangle sides via the formula:\n\n1/s = 1/200 +1/240 +1/300\n\nWait, that would be  (12 +10 +8)/1200 =30/1200 \u21d2 1/s=1/40 \u21d2 s=40, but that is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, using 2/s = 1/200 +1/240 +1/300 \u21d2 2/s = (12+10+8)/1200 \u21d2 30/1200 \u21d2 1/40 \u21d2 s=80.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side length is the harmonic mean or something.\n\nAlternatively, in my previous result s=1200/19. Let me compute 1200 divided by 19:\n\n19\u00d763=1197, so 1200-1197=3 \u21d2 1200/19=63+3/19\u224863.157.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have an integer answer of 120, but then 19\u00d763=1197, close to 1200.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in Equation D:\n\nEquation D was derived from FA parallel to QR.\n\nVector FA is from F to A, which must be parallel to QR. QR's direction vector is (-19, sqrt(57239)). The vector FA was computed as (200t - F_x, -F_y).\n\nWait, in the calculation for Equation (3):\n\n200t - F_x = -19k,\n\n-F_y = k*sqrt(57239).\n\nBut the direction could be opposite. Perhaps the vector FA should be proportional to QR's direction vector, not necessarily the same direction.\n\nQR's direction vector is from Q to R, but FA might be in the opposite direction.\n\nSuppose that vector FA is parallel to QR, but direction could be opposite.\n\nThus, vector FA could be proportional to (19, -sqrt(57239)) instead of (-19, sqrt(57239)). Wait, QR vector is (-19, sqrt(57239)), so the reverse direction would be (19, -sqrt(57239)).\n\nThus, if vector FA = m*(19, -sqrt(57239)),\n\nthen:\n\n200t - F_x =19m,\n\n-F_y = -sqrt(57239)*m \u21d2 F_y = sqrt(57239)*m.\n\nBut F_y is the y-coordinate of F: F_y = sqrt(57239)*(1 - v - s/300).\n\nThus,\n\nsqrt(57239)*(1 - v - s/300) = sqrt(57239)*m \u21d2 m =1 -v -s/300.\n\nSubstituting into first equation:\n\n200t - F_x =19*(1 -v -s/300).\n\nNow F_x =181 -181*(v + s/300).\n\nTherefore,\n\n200t - [181 -181(v + s/300)] =19*(1 -v -s/300).\n\nExpand left side:\n\n200t -181 +181v +181*(s/300).\n\nRight side:19 -19v -19*(s/300).\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n200t -181 +181v + (181/300)s -19 +19v + (19/300)s =0\n\nCombine terms:\n\n200t -200 + (181v +19v) + [ (181 +19)/300 ]s =0 \u21d2\n\n200t -200 +200v + (200/300)s =0 \u21d2\n\n200t +200v + (2/3)s =200 \u21d2\n\nDivide by 200:\n\nt +v + (2/300)s =1 \u21d2 t +v + s/150 =1, which is the same as before. So the direction didn't affect the equation. So the previous result holds.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be 1200/19. Since the problem might accept fractions, I'll go with that. However, let me check once again if this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is from a past competition where the answer is 120. Maybe a different approach is needed.\n\nAnother approach: The triangle formed by the extensions has sides 200,240,300. Let the hexagon have side length s.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral with opposite sides parallel, each pair of opposite sides are separated by a distance that can be related to the triangle's sides.\n\nThe key idea is that the side of the hexagon is the harmonic mean of the triangle sides or something similar, but let me think in terms of similar triangles.\n\nThe three sides of the triangle are the extensions of AB, CD, EF. The hexagon is formed such that each side is a translation of the opposite side along the direction perpendicular to them, maintaining the equilateral condition. The distance between each pair of opposite sides would then relate to the triangle's sides.\n\nThe distance between two parallel lines (opposite sides) can be calculated, and since the hexagon's side is the length s, which is the same in all directions, perhaps the sum of the distances relates to the triangle's sides.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept that in such a configuration, the side length s of the hexagon satisfies:\n\n1/s = 1/200 +1/240 +1/300,\n\nbut that would give s = 1/( (3+2.5+2)/600 )? Wait,\n\nWait, compute 1/200 +1/240 +1/300:\n\nCommon denominator 1200,\n\n6/1200 +5/1200 +4/1200 =15/1200=1/80 \u21d2 1/s =1/80 \u21d2 s=80. Hmm, that's an integer.\n\nWait, this might be the case. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, if the side s is the harmonic mean of the triangle sides, but not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is s = (2 * area of triangle)/(perimeter/3) or something, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be using the formula that the side length of the hexagon is (a*b*c)/(a*b + b*c + c*a) or some combination.\n\nWait, let me compute 1/200 + 1/240 +1/300.\n\n1/200 =0.005, 1/240\u22480.004166..., 1/300\u22480.003333..., total \u22480.0125, which is 1/80. So s=80. Maybe this is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, this might be the case if the hexagon's sides are related to the triangle's sides via this reciprocal relation, but how?\n\nWait, let me think of the triangle's sides as the sums of the hexagon's side and twice the distance between the opposite sides. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, if the triangle sides are divided by the hexagon into segments such that the ratios are the same, leading to the harmonic mean.\n\nAlternatively, if the hexagon's side s is such that it divides each triangle side into parts that are proportional to s and the other sides.\n\nWait, let me consider that when you have three lines forming a triangle, and a hexagon with opposite sides parallel to the triangle's sides, the side length s of the hexagon can be given by s = (a*b*c)/(a*b + b*c + c*a). Let me compute that:\n\na=200, b=240, c=300.\n\nNumerator: 200*240*300=200*72,000=14,400,000\n\nDenominator: (200*240)+(240*300)+(300*200)=48,000 +72,000 +60,000=180,000\n\nThus s=14,400,000 /180,000 =80. Oh! That gives s=80, which is an integer. This might be the correct answer.\n\nBut how is this derived?\n\nThis formula resembles the formula for the radius of the inscribed sphere in a triangular prism, but not sure. Alternatively, in some geometric configuration where the product over sum gives the side length.\n\nAlternatively, this might be the correct answer, and my previous approach had an error.\n\nLet me see where the discrepancy is.\n\nIf the answer is 80, then in my previous equations, substituting s=80:\n\nEquation D: t +v +80/150 = t +v + 8/15 =1 \u21d2 t +v =7/15.\n\nFrom Equation C: u =1 - (11*80)/1200 =1 - 880/1200 =1 - 11/15=4/15.\n\nFrom Equation B: v =1 -u -80/240 =1 -4/15 -1/3 =1 -4/15 -5/15=6/15=2/5=0.4.\n\nFrom Equation E: t = s/240 =80/240=1/3\u22480.3333.\n\nThus, t +v =1/3 +2/5 = (5 +6)/15=11/15. But Equation D requires t +v =7/15, which contradicts. So 11/15\u22607/15. So inconsistency.\n\nThus, if s=80, the equations are inconsistent, so that can't be.\n\nHmm, so that formula gives 80 but contradicts the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me check with s=1200/19\u224863.15789.\n\nCompute u =1 - (11/1200)s=1 - (11/1200)(1200/19)=1-11/19=8/19\u22480.421.\n\nv= s/200= (1200/19)/200=6/19\u22480.3158.\n\nt= s/240= (1200/19)/240=5/19\u22480.263.\n\nThen t +v =5/19 +6/19=11/19\u22480.5789.\n\nAdding s/150= (1200/19)/150=8/19\u22480.421.\n\nTotal:11/19 +8/19=19/19=1, which checks out.\n\nSo the equations are consistent for s=1200/19. Thus, the correct answer must be 1200/19. Since the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", and it doesn't specify to round, the exact fraction is needed.\n\nBut 1200 divided by 19 is indeed 1200/19, so I think that is the answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1200}{19}}\n\n\nGiven a convex equilateral hexagon \\(ABCDEF\\) with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, and a triangle formed by extending segments \\(AB\\), \\(CD\\), and \\(EF\\) with side lengths 200, 240, and 300, we need to find the side length \\(s\\) of the hexagon.\n\n1. **Coordinate Setup and Triangle Properties**:\n   - Place the triangle \\(PQR\\) with vertices \\(P(0,0)\\), \\(Q(200,0)\\), and \\(R(181, \\sqrt{57239})\\).\n   - The sides of the triangle are \\(PQ = 200\\), \\(QR = 240\\), and \\(PR = 300\\).\n\n2. **Hexagon Vertices on Triangle Sides**:\n   - Vertices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are on \\(PQ\\), \\(C\\) and \\(D\\) are on \\(QR\\), and \\(E\\) and \\(F\\) are on \\(RP\\).\n   - The hexagon's sides \\(AB\\), \\(CD\\), and \\(EF\\) are along the sides of the triangle, and the other sides \\(BC\\), \\(DE\\), and \\(FA\\) are parallel to the triangle's sides.\n\n3. **Parameterization and Equations**:\n   - Parameterize the positions of vertices using fractions along the triangle's sides.\n   - Set up equations based on the parallelism and equilateral conditions of the hexagon.\n\n4. **Solving the Equations**:\n   - Derived equations from the parallelism conditions and the equilateral requirement:\n     - \\(1 - t - u = \\frac{s}{200}\\)\n     - \\(v = 1 - u - \\frac{s}{240}\\)\n     - \\(u = 1 - \\frac{11s}{1200}\\)\n     - \\(t + v + \\frac{s}{150} = 1\\)\n   - Solving these equations step-by-step leads to the side length \\(s = \\frac{1200}{19}\\).\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - Substituting \\(s = \\frac{1200}{19}\\) into all equations confirms consistency.\n\nThus, the side length of the hexagon is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{1200}{19}}\\).",

That means AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. \n\nThe problem mentions a triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. Let me visualize this. If we extend those three sides, their extensions should meet to form a triangle. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let me denote the triangle as T, with its three sides being the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, and 300. \n\nWait, actually, the triangle's sides are the extensions of AB, CD, and EF? Or is it that the triangle is formed by the lines extended from those segments? Maybe I need to think of it as follows: If you take lines AB, CD, and EF and extend them until they meet, forming a triangle. Since AB is opposite to DE, CD is opposite to FA, and EF is opposite to BC. Since opposite sides are parallel, these lines must form a triangle when extended. \n\nLet me think of coordinate geometry. Maybe setting up coordinates would help. Let me try to place the hexagon in a coordinate system. Let me suppose that AB is horizontal for simplicity. Since all opposite sides are parallel, DE is also horizontal, BC is parallel to EF, and CD is parallel to FA. \n\nAlternatively, since all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon is a translation of its opposite sides. Maybe using vectors or similar triangles?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle formed by the extensions is similar to the triangle formed by the sides of the hexagon? Hmm, not sure yet. Let me think step by step.\n\nLet me denote the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF as triangle XYZ, with each side corresponding to the extension of one of those sides. The side lengths XY, YZ, ZX are 200, 240, 300. \n\nWait, actually, the problem says \"the triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF\". So each side of the triangle is an extension of one of those segments. That means each side of triangle XYZ is colinear with AB, CD, or EF. Since AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, which is convex, their extensions must form a triangle outside the hexagon. \n\nSince the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF must be similar to a triangle related to the hexagon's sides. Maybe the sides of the triangle are proportional to the sides of the hexagon?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle's sides are made by extending the sides until they meet. Let me think of how three lines can form a triangle when extended. Since opposite sides are parallel, the lines AB and DE are parallel, so their extensions won't meet unless we extend in the opposite direction. Wait, but if we are extending AB, CD, and EF, which are non-adjacent sides, but each pair of opposite sides are parallel, so AB || DE, CD || FA, and EF || BC. \n\nWait, so if I extend AB, CD, and EF, their extensions must intersect each other at three different points forming a triangle. Let me denote the lines:\n\nLet me call line L1 as the line containing AB extended beyond A and B. Similarly, line L2 as the line containing CD extended beyond C and D, and line L3 as the line containing EF extended beyond E and F. The triangle is formed by the intersection points of L1, L2, and L3. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, 300. \n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, perhaps the triangle formed is related through some ratio. Let me think of the hexagon as being a combination of three parallelograms? Since each pair of opposite sides are parallel and equal in length (since it's equilateral), so the distance between the sides is fixed?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using homothety. Since the hexagon is between the sides of the triangle, perhaps the hexagon is a section of the triangle scaled down by some factor. \n\nAlternatively, coordinate geometry. Let me try to set up coordinates. Let me place the hexagon in such a way that the triangle XYZ (the one with sides 200,240,300) is the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inside it. Let me suppose that the lines AB, CD, EF are parts of the sides of this triangle, but extended? Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assign coordinates to the triangle first. Let me suppose triangle ABC (but not to confuse with the hexagon's vertices). Let me denote the triangle formed by the extensions as triangle PQR with sides PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300. Let me assign coordinates to triangle PQR. Let me place point P at (0,0), Q at (200,0), and R somewhere in the plane. Wait, but need to satisfy the triangle sides. Let me compute coordinates properly.\n\nWait, actually, to make things easier, maybe use coordinates such that triangle PQR is placed with side lengths 200, 240, 300. Let me first find the coordinates of triangle PQR. Let me let PQ be 200 units along the x-axis, so P=(0,0), Q=(200,0). Then point R is somewhere such that PR=300 and QR=240. Let me compute coordinates of R.\n\nLet me denote coordinates of R as (x,y). Then distance from P to R is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=300, and from Q to R is sqrt((x-200)^2 + y\u00b2)=240. Let me set up equations:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 = 90000,\n\n(x - 200)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 240\u00b2 = 57600.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x\u00b2 -400x +40000) + y\u00b2] = 90000 -57600,\n\nSimplify: 400x -40000 = 32400,\n\nSo 400x = 72400 \u2192 x = 72400 / 400 = 181.\n\nWait, 72400 divided by 400: 72400 / 400 = 181. Hmm, okay. Then x = 181.\n\nThen plug back into first equation: 181\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 90000,\n\nCompute 181\u00b2: 180\u00b2=32400, so 181\u00b2 = (180+1)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180 +1 = 32400 + 360 +1= 32761.\n\nSo y\u00b2 = 90000 - 32761 = 57239, so y = sqrt(57239). Hmm, okay, so coordinates of R are (181, sqrt(57239)). Not sure if exact value needed, but maybe coordinates can be kept symbolic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using vectors or area. Since the triangle sides are 200,240,300, perhaps I can compute its area via Heron's formula. Let me check that first, maybe useful later.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter: s = (200 +240 +300)/2 = 740/2 = 370.\n\nArea = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)) = sqrt(370*170*130*70). Hmm, that's a bit messy, but perhaps manageable. Let's see:\n\n370*170 = 62900, 130*70=9100, so total 62900*9100. Wait, but maybe better factor into primes:\n\n370 = 37*10 = 37*2*5,\n\n170=17*10=17*2*5,\n\n130=13*10=13*2*5,\n\n70=7*10=7*2*5,\n\nThus s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)= 370*170*130*70 = (2*5*37)*(2*5*17)*(2*5*13)*(2*5*7) \n\n= 2^4 *5^4 *37*17*13*7,\n\nThus sqrt(2^4 *5^4 *37*17*13*7 ) = 2^2 *5^2 * sqrt(37*17*13*7) = 4*25*sqrt(37*17*13*7) = 100*sqrt(37*17*13*7). \n\nHmm, perhaps leave it as is for now. Maybe the area will come into play later. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hexagon is related to the triangle through homothety. Since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, maybe each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle? Wait, but the problem says opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel. The triangle sides are the extensions of AB, CD, EF. So maybe the sides of the triangle are in some proportion to the sides of the hexagon?\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of similar triangles. Since the hexagon is between the sides of the triangle, perhaps the sides of the hexagon are parallel to the sides of the triangle but scaled down. Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the scaling factors must be the same along all three directions.\n\nWait, let's suppose that the hexagon is formed by three pairs of lines parallel to the sides of triangle PQR, each pair separated by a certain distance such that the hexagon sides are equal. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the distances between the parallel sides must be such that the lengths of the hexagon edges are equal. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the hexagon as the inner section between three pairs of lines parallel to the sides of triangle PQR, each pair of lines separated by a distance such that the edges of the hexagon are all length s. The intersections of these lines form the hexagon. Since the original triangle has sides 200,240,300, and the hexagon is inside it, the sides of the hexagon would be proportional to the sides of the triangle?\n\nWait, perhaps using the concept of a hexagon inscribed in a triangle with sides parallel to the triangle's sides. If that's the case, there might be a formula or ratio that relates the side lengths. Alternatively, using trilinear coordinates or barycentric coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the hexagon as follows: Each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle and the distance between each pair of parallel sides (original triangle side and the corresponding hexagon side) is such that the hexagon's edges are all equal. Since the triangle sides are 200,240,300, perhaps the hexagon's sides can be found via some ratio related to those lengths.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides of the hexagon are equal, the distances between the parallel sides must be such that the edges are equal. Let me consider the triangle's sides as lines, and the hexagon sides as lines parallel to them but offset inward. The intersections of these offset lines form the hexagon. \n\nSuppose that the distance from each side of the triangle to the corresponding side of the hexagon is proportional. Let\u2019s denote the distances as d1, d2, d3 for the three sides. Then, the side length s of the hexagon can be expressed in terms of the distances and the angles of the triangle. \n\nAlternatively, let's model this with coordinate systems. Let me place the triangle PQR with coordinates as follows:\n\nLet me set point P at (0,0), Q at (200,0), and R somewhere in the plane. Let me compute coordinates of R as I started earlier. Earlier steps gave x=181, y = sqrt(57239). Let me confirm:\n\nWait, when I had:\n\nFrom the two equations:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 90000,\n\nand (x-200)^2 + y\u00b2 = 57600.\n\nSubtracting gives: (x\u00b2 -400x +40000) + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 57600 -90000,\n\nWait, no, actually that was wrong. Wait, let me redo the subtraction step.\n\nWait first equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 90000,\n\nSecond equation is (x-200)^2 + y^2 = 240\u00b2 = 57600.\n\nSubtracting second equation from first:\n\n[x\u00b2 + y\u00b2] - [(x-200)^2 + y\u00b2] = 90000 - 57600,\n\nExpand (x-200)^2: x\u00b2 -400x +40000,\n\nThus, left side becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 +400x -40000 - y\u00b2 = 400x -40000,\n\nRight side is 32400,\n\nSo 400x -40000 = 32400,\n\nThus, 400x = 72400 \u2192 x=181, that's correct.\n\nThen y\u00b2 = 90000 - (181)^2,\n\n181 squared: 180\u00b2 = 32400, plus 2*180 +1 = 360 +1 = 361, so 32400 + 361 = 32761,\n\nThus, y\u00b2 = 90000 -32761 = 57239,\n\nSo y = sqrt(57239). Let me see if this is a whole number? 239\u00b2 is 57121, 240\u00b2 is 57600, so between 239 and 240. Not a perfect square. So okay, coordinates are (181, sqrt(57239)). Not sure if useful, but proceed.\n\nNow, the hexagon is inside this triangle, with each side parallel to a side of the triangle. Wait, but the hexagon's sides are AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. The problem states that opposite sides are parallel, so AB || DE, BC || EF, CD || FA. The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF (which are three non-consecutive sides of the hexagon) is triangle PQR with sides 200, 240, 300.\n\nWait, perhaps each side of the hexagon is a segment between two sides of the triangle? Let me think. Since AB is part of side PQ of the triangle? Wait, no. Actually, the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, EF. So lines AB, CD, EF when extended form triangle PQR. Hence, the original hexagon is inscribed in a way that its sides AB, CD, EF are parts of the three sides of triangle PQR. Wait, but since the hexagon is convex, those sides must be closer to the triangle's vertices?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hexagon is such that each of its sides lies on a line parallel to a side of triangle PQR but offset inward. Let's think of the hexagon as being formed by three pairs of lines parallel to the sides of triangle PQR, each pair separated by a certain distance, such that the intersections form the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the distances must be chosen so that the sides are all equal length s. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let me denote the triangle as PQR with sides PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300. Let me consider lines parallel to each side of triangle PQR, offset inward by some distance, so that the intersections of these lines form the hexagon. The three pairs of lines would be:\n\n- Two lines parallel to PQ (the side of length 200), one on each side of the hexagon.\n\n- Two lines parallel to QR (240), and similarly for RP (300).\n\nThe intersections of these lines would form the hexagon, with each side of the hexagon lying on one of these lines. Since opposite sides are parallel, this setup makes sense.\n\nLet me denote the distances from each side of triangle PQR to the corresponding parallel sides of the hexagon as d_PQ, d_QR, d_RP. These distances would determine how \"far in\" the hexagon is from each side of the triangle. The side length s of the hexagon can be related to these distances and the angles of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side length s is proportional to the sides of the triangle. Let me consider the triangle's sides as PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300, and the hexagon's sides are parallel to these. Let me assume that the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down, but since it's a hexagon, that might not hold. Alternatively, maybe each side of the hexagon is a certain fraction of the triangle's sides.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of intercept theorem (Thales' theorem). Suppose along each side of the triangle, the hexagon's vertices divide the sides proportionally. Let me see.\n\nSuppose on side PQ of the triangle, which is length 200, the hexagon's side AB lies somewhere along this side. Wait, actually, the side AB of the hexagon is part of the line PQ extended? Wait, no, actually the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, EF, so the lines AB, CD, EF when extended form the triangle. So perhaps the hexagon is inside the triangle, with its sides AB, CD, EF being parts of lines that, when extended, form the triangle's sides.\n\nWait, maybe better to think of the triangle as the outer triangle, and the hexagon is inside it, with each side of the hexagon lying on a line parallel to a side of the triangle, but offset inward. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the distances from each side of the triangle to the corresponding side of the hexagon must be such that the edges of the hexagon are equal in length.\n\nLet me consider the triangle PQR. Let me denote the three pairs of parallel sides:\n\n- The side PQ (length 200) has two lines parallel to it inside the triangle, forming two sides of the hexagon (AB and DE), separated by some distance.\n\n- Similarly, QR (240) has two lines parallel to it (BC and EF), and RP (300) has two lines (CD and FA).\n\nThe intersections of these lines form the hexagon. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the distance between the parallel lines must be such that the lengths of the sides are equal. \n\nTo model this, let me use coordinate geometry. Let me place triangle PQR with coordinates as before. Let me set point P at (0,0), Q at (200,0), and R at (181, sqrt(57239)). Let me denote this as (x_R, y_R). \n\nNow, let's consider the lines parallel to the sides. For instance, a line parallel to PQ (which is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (200,0)) would be a horizontal line. Let me denote the two lines parallel to PQ as follows: one is the side AB of the hexagon, lying somewhere above the base PQ, and the opposite side DE lying further inward. Similarly, the lines parallel to QR and RP will form the other sides.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use barycentric coordinates or parametric equations for the lines. Alternatively, use the concept of similar triangles.\n\nSuppose that along each side of triangle PQR, there are points where the hexagon's vertices lie. Let me denote the distances from the sides of the triangle to the hexagon's sides as fractions of the triangle's height. Let me consider the heights of the triangle first.\n\nWait, maybe first compute the heights of the triangle PQR. Let me compute the height from point R to base PQ. Since PQ is along the x-axis from (0,0) to (200,0), the height is just the y-coordinate of point R, which is sqrt(57239). Let me denote h_PQ = sqrt(57239). Similarly, the heights from other sides can be calculated, but this might get complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using area. Let me denote the area of triangle PQR as A. Then, the area can also be expressed in terms of the base and height. For instance, area A = (base PQ * height from R)/2 = (200 * sqrt(57239))/2 = 100*sqrt(57239). Alternatively, Heron's formula gave A = 100*sqrt(37*17*13*7). Let me see if sqrt(57239) equals sqrt(37*17*13*7). Let me compute 37*17 = 629, 13*7=91, so 629*91. Let me compute 629*90=56610, plus 629=57239. Yes, so sqrt(57239) = sqrt(37*17*13*7), so that matches. So the area is indeed 100*sqrt(37*17*13*7).\n\nAlternatively, maybe using ratios. Let me think of the hexagon as cutting the triangle into three smaller triangles and the hexagon. The sides of the hexagon are parallel to the triangle's sides, so each of the three smaller triangles at the corners would be similar to the original triangle PQR.\n\nLet me suppose that along each side of triangle PQR, the hexagon is at a distance such that the ratio of the sides is k. So, for instance, the side AB of the hexagon is parallel to PQ and is located at a distance that reduces the triangle's side by a factor of k. Wait, maybe the sides of the hexagon divide the sides of the triangle into segments with a certain ratio.\n\nSuppose that on each side of triangle PQR, the hexagon's vertices divide the sides into a ratio of m:n. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the ratios must be consistent across all sides. Let me denote the ratio as t, so that the distance from the vertex to the hexagon's side is t times the length of the triangle's side. Wait, perhaps using the concept that the hexagon's sides are parallel, so the triangles formed are similar.\n\nLet me suppose that the three lines parallel to the sides of triangle PQR (forming the hexagon) cut the sides of the triangle in the same ratio. Let's say that along each side of the triangle, the distance from the vertex to the hexagon's side is proportional to some factor. Let me denote the ratio as t, such that the length from the vertex to the hexagon's side is t times the length of the triangle's side. Then, the remaining length would be (1 - t) times the side length, and the hexagon's side would be scaled by (1 - t). However, since the hexagon is formed by lines on both sides of each direction, maybe it's a combination of two such ratios?\n\nAlternatively, since there are two parallel sides for each direction (like two lines parallel to PQ, one near the base and one near the top), the distance between them would determine the side length of the hexagon. Let me suppose that the distance between the two lines parallel to PQ is such that the side length s of the hexagon can be calculated from the distance and the angle between the sides.\n\nAlternatively, since all the sides of the hexagon are equal, the product of the distance between the parallel lines and the sine of the angle between the sides should be equal for all three directions. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to use coordinates. Let me try again with coordinates.\n\nLet me denote the triangle PQR with coordinates P(0,0), Q(200,0), R(x_R, y_R) where x_R = 181 and y_R = sqrt(57239). Let me now consider the lines parallel to the sides of the triangle that form the hexagon.\n\nLet me first consider the side PQ (from P(0,0) to Q(200,0)). A line parallel to PQ (which is horizontal) would be of the form y = k for some constant k between 0 and y_R. Similarly, another line parallel to PQ but on the opposite side of the hexagon would be at some y = k', but since the hexagon is inside the triangle, probably only one line parallel to PQ is needed for the hexagon's side? Wait, no, actually, the hexagon has two sides parallel to each of the triangle's sides. So for the direction of PQ, there are two lines: one above PQ and one below? Wait, but since the hexagon is inside the triangle, maybe two lines parallel to PQ between PQ and R. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to parametrize each of the three pairs of parallel lines.\n\nLet me consider three parameters: let\u2019s say that the distance from side PQ to the hexagon's side AB (parallel to PQ) is d1, and the distance from the opposite side DE (also parallel to PQ) to the vertex R is d2. Similarly for the other sides. But this might get complicated. Alternatively, using similar triangles.\n\nSuppose that the hexagon creates three smaller similar triangles at the corners of triangle PQR. Each of these smaller triangles would be similar to PQR. Let me denote the scaling factors for each corner as a, b, c, such that the sides of the smaller triangles are a*200, a*240, a*300, etc. But since the hexagon is equilateral, the sides of the hexagon (which are the sides between these triangles) must all be equal. \n\nLet me think of the side of the hexagon between the triangle at P and the triangle at Q. The length of this side should be proportional to (1 - a - b) times the original side? Hmm, this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote that the lines forming the hexagon divide each side of triangle PQR into segments with ratios. Let's suppose that along side PQ, the hexagon's side AB meets PQ at some point dividing PQ into a ratio. Similarly for the other sides.\n\nLet me consider the side PQ of length 200. Suppose that the line parallel to QR (one of the hexagon's sides) intersects PQ at point A, and the line parallel to RP intersects PQ at point B, forming side AB of the hexagon. The length AB should be equal to s, the side of the hexagon. Similarly, this applies to other sides.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides are equal, the ratios along each side of the triangle must be consistent. Let me denote that along each side of triangle PQR, the division points are such that the segments between the vertices and the division points are proportional. Let me suppose that on each side of the triangle, the division is such that the ratio of the segment from the vertex to the division point to the entire side is equal to some constant k. Then the remaining segment would be (1 - k) times the side length, which would correspond to the side of the hexagon divided by the scaling factor. \n\nWait, perhaps using the concept of parallel lines cutting sides proportionally. For example, if a line parallel to QR cuts side PQ at point A and side PR at point B, then PA / PQ = PB / PR. But since the hexagon has sides parallel to QR, the lines forming the hexagon must cut the sides in such a way that the ratios are consistent. \n\nAlternatively, let me use vectors. Let me denote vectors for the triangle's sides and then express the hexagon's sides in terms of these vectors. \n\nLet me denote vectors:\n\nLet\u2019s let vector PQ = Q - P = (200, 0).\n\nVector PR = R - P = (x_R, y_R).\n\nVector QR = R - Q = (x_R - 200, y_R).\n\nNow, suppose that the hexagon is formed by points A, B, C, D, E, F such that AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, CD parallel to FA, and all sides have length s. The lines AB, CD, EF when extended form triangle PQR with sides 200,240,300. \n\nSuppose that point A is along PQ, point B is along QR, etc., but this is getting too vague. Maybe it's better to use affine transformations or homothety.\n\nAlternatively, since all opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be considered as a centrally symmetric figure? Wait, no, because in a centrally symmetric hexagon opposite sides are not only parallel but also equal in length, which is true here, but convex equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel may not necessarily be centrally symmetric, but in this case, since all sides are equal and opposite sides are parallel, it might be.\n\nWait, if it's centrally symmetric, then there exists a center point such that each vertex is the reflection of the opposite vertex over the center. In that case, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF would also have some symmetry. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the hexagon as follows: Each pair of opposite sides are translations of each other. Since they are parallel and equal length, the translation vector would be the same for each pair. \n\nSuppose that the translation vectors between opposite sides are such that when you extend them, they form triangle PQR. The key idea might be that the sides of the triangle are formed by these translations. \n\nLet me consider that the distance between the opposite sides (e.g., AB and DE) is such that when extended, they meet at a vertex of the triangle. The length of the triangle's side is related to the distance between the opposite sides and the angle between the sides.\n\nLet me denote the distance between side AB and DE as h1, between BC and EF as h2, and between CD and FA as h3. The sides of triangle PQR would then be proportional to h1/sin \u03b1, where \u03b1 is the angle between the respective sides. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the triangle's sides are formed by the lines containing AB, CD, EF. The length of each side of the triangle would be the distance between the two opposite sides of the hexagon divided by the sine of the angle between those lines. Since all sides of the hexagon are equal, perhaps these distances are related by the angles of the triangle.\n\nLet me suppose that the triangle PQR has angles \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 at vertices P, Q, R respectively. Then, the distance between the two sides of the hexagon parallel to PQ would be h1 = s * sin \u03b2 / sin(\u03b2 - \u03b8), where \u03b8 is some angle? Hmm, maybe this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to use area relations. The area of triangle PQR can be expressed as the area of the hexagon plus the areas of the three smaller triangles formed outside the hexagon but inside PQR. Since the hexagon is equilateral and the triangles are similar, maybe the areas relate in a way that allows us to find s.\n\nLet me denote the scaling factors for the three smaller triangles as k1, k2, k3, so their sides are k1*200, k1*240, k1*300; similarly for the others? Wait, actually each smaller triangle would be similar to PQR but scaled down. Let's suppose that the triangle adjacent to vertex P has sides scaled by a factor of a, the one at Q by b, and at R by c. Then, the sides of the hexagon would be proportional to the differences between the original triangle sides and the scaled sides. \n\nSpecifically, the side of the hexagon opposite to P (which is parallel to PQ) would be the side of the triangle at Q and R minus the scaled triangles. Wait, perhaps the side length s of the hexagon is equal to (side of PQR - a*side - b*side)/something? Wait, maybe more precisely, if the triangle at P is scaled by factor a, then its side opposite to P (which is parallel to QR) would be a*240, and similarly, the triangle at Q scaled by b would have a side parallel to RP of length b*300, etc. \n\nThe hexagon's sides would then be the remaining parts between these scaled triangles. For instance, the side of the hexagon parallel to PQ would be the original side QR (240) minus the scaled sides from the triangles at Q and R. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe better to write equations.\n\nLet me denote that the three small triangles at the corners have scaling factors a, b, c such that:\n\n- The triangle at P has sides a*200, a*240, a*300.\n\n- The triangle at Q has sides b*200, b*240, b*300.\n\n- The triangle at R has sides c*200, c*240, c*300.\n\nWait, but actually, each corner triangle is similar to the main triangle, so their sides are scaled by a, b, c respectively. The sides of the hexagon would then be the differences between the original triangle sides and the corresponding sides of the corner triangles. \n\nHowever, the hexagon sides must all be equal. For example, the side between the triangle at P and the triangle at Q would be along the side PQ, but actually, the hexagon side would be along a line connecting a point on PQ to a point on QR, but this is not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, the side of the hexagon parallel to QR would be the side of the triangle at R minus the scaled triangle at R? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the length of each side of the hexagon can be expressed as (1 - a - b) times the corresponding side of the triangle? Maybe not exactly, but let's think. Suppose along side PQ of length 200, the two triangles at P and Q eat up a portion a*200 and b*200, so the remaining length for the hexagon's side would be 200 - a*200 - b*200 = 200(1 -a -b). But since the hexagon's side is not along PQ but parallel to QR or something else, perhaps this is not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, think in terms of the three scaling factors a, b, c must satisfy certain conditions to make all hexagon sides equal.\n\nLet me think of the three directions:\n\n1. The side of the hexagon parallel to PQ (length 200) has length s = (something related to a and b).\n\n2. The side parallel to QR (240) has length s = (something related to b and c).\n\n3. The side parallel to RP (300) has length s = (something related to c and a).\n\nSince all are equal to s, we can set up equations.\n\nAssuming the triangles at P, Q, R have scaling factors a, b, c, then the distance from each vertex to the hexagon's side is proportional to a, b, c. \n\nThe length of the hexagon's side parallel to PQ would be equal to the side of the triangle QR scaled by (1 - a - b). Wait, maybe more precisely:\n\nThe side of the hexagon parallel to QR would be equal to (1 - b - c) times QR's length? I'm not sure. Maybe using similar triangles.\n\nAlternatively, the side length s of the hexagon can be related to the sides of the triangle through the scaling factors:\n\nIf the triangle at P has scaling factor a, then the distance from P to the hexagon's side along PQ is a * height from P. Similarly for the other sides. The side length s would then be related to the original triangle's sides minus twice the scaled distances? Hmm, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the lines forming the hexagon. Each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon are separated by a distance, and the triangle's sides are the lines formed when these sides are extended. The length of the triangle's side is the distance between the two opposite sides of the hexagon divided by the sine of the angle between the other two sides. Since the triangle's sides are 200,240,300, and the hexagon's sides are s, perhaps there's a relationship between s and the triangle's sides through trigonometric functions.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral and the triangle is formed by its extensions, maybe the side length s is the harmonic mean or geometric mean of the triangle's sides? But that might be a stretch. Alternatively, using the formula for a hexagon inscribed in a triangle with parallel sides: perhaps each side of the hexagon is (200 * 240 * 300)^(1/3) or something, but that might not be right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the problem in terms of the intercept theorem. Suppose that on each side of triangle PQR, the hexagon's vertices divide the sides proportionally. Let me denote that on side PQ, the point where the hexagon's side meets PQ divides PQ into segments of length x and (200 - x). Similarly, on QR, the division is y and (240 - y), and on RP, z and (300 - z). The ratios x/200 = y/240 = z/300 = k (some constant) if the divisions are proportional. But since the hexagon's sides must be equal, this might lead us somewhere.\n\nWait, the intercept theorem states that if a line parallel to one side of a triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally. So, if the hexagon's sides are parallel to the triangle's sides, then the division ratios must be consistent.\n\nSuppose that the side of the hexagon parallel to PQ (the base) intersects QR and RP at points dividing them proportionally. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me suppose that on side QR (length 240), the division point is at a distance from Q equal to m*240, and similarly on side RP (length 300), the division point is at n*300 from R. Since the line is parallel to PQ, by intercept theorem, m = n. Let me denote this common ratio as t. Therefore, the division points on QR and RP would be at t*240 from Q and t*300 from R respectively. \n\nSimilarly, the other sides of the hexagon would lead to similar ratios. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the length of the side parallel to PQ must equal the length of the side parallel to QR and RP. \n\nLet me compute the length of the side parallel to PQ first. The line parallel to PQ cutting QR at t*240 from Q and RP at t*300 from R would form a segment whose length can be calculated using similar triangles. Since the triangle formed by this parallel line is similar to PQR with scaling factor (1 - t). Wait, actually, if the distance from the base PQ is proportional, then scaling factor would be (1 - t). So the length of the parallel side would be (1 - t)*200. Wait, but PQ is the base, so maybe the scaling is t instead?\n\nWait, let me think again. If we move up from the base PQ towards the apex R, the line parallel to PQ at a height h would form a smaller similar triangle with height h', so the scaling factor is h'/H where H is the total height. The length of the parallel side would then be (h'/H)*200. But in this case, if the division ratio along QR and RP is t, then the height might correspond to that. \n\nAlternatively, the length of the side parallel to PQ would be (1 - t)*200. Similarly, the side parallel to QR would be (1 - t)*240, but since all sides of the hexagon must be equal, we have:\n\n(1 - t)*200 = (1 - s)*240 = (1 - u)*300,\n\nwhere s and u are the scaling factors for the other sides. Wait, this might not be the right way. \n\nAlternatively, since all three sides of the hexagon must be equal, the scaling factors for the three directions must satisfy:\n\nLength_parallel_to_PQ = Length_parallel_to_QR = Length_parallel_to_RP = s.\n\nIf the scaling factor for the side parallel to PQ is t, then its length is t*(200), but actually in the intercept theorem, the proportional length would be (1 - t)*original_length if t is the fraction from the vertex. Hmm, getting confused again.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that each side of the hexagon corresponds to a similar triangle with scaling factor k, so the length of the hexagon's side would be k times the corresponding side of the triangle. But since there are three different sides, maybe the scaling factors are different for each direction but adjusted so that the hexagon sides are equal.\n\nLet me suppose that the three scaling factors are k1, k2, k3 such that:\n\nk1 * 200 = k2 * 240 = k3 * 300 = s.\n\nAdditionally, the scaling factors must satisfy some condition based on the geometry of the triangle. For instance, the scaling factors must sum up to 1 in some way due to the overlapping areas.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the three smaller triangles at the corners have scaling factors a, b, c, then the scaling factors for the hexagon's sides would be related to (1 - a - b), etc., but this is vague.\n\nAlternatively, since the lines forming the hexagon's sides divide the triangle's sides proportionally, the ratios must satisfy certain conditions. Let me suppose that along each side of the triangle, the division point divides the side into a ratio of m:n, and due to the hexagon being equilateral, these ratios must satisfy m/n = ... for all sides. \n\nAlternatively, let me try to set up equations using coordinates. Let me proceed with coordinates for triangle PQR as follows:\n\nLet me place point P at (0, 0), Q at (200, 0), and R at (x_R, y_R) where x_R = 181 and y_R = sqrt(57239) \u2248 239.2 (since 239^2 = 57121, 240^2 = 57600). \n\nNow, suppose the hexagon has vertices A, B, C, D, E, F. Let me attempt to parameterize their positions:\n\nLet me assume that side AB is part of a line parallel to PQ (the base), so it's a horizontal line. Let me denote the y-coordinate of this line as y1. Similarly, the opposite side DE will be another horizontal line at y2. Since the hexagon is convex and between the base and the apex, y1 and y2 must satisfy 0 < y1 < y2 < y_R.\n\nThe length of AB can be calculated as the horizontal distance between the intersections of the line y = y1 with the other two sides of the triangle (PR and QR). Similarly, the length of DE would be the horizontal distance between the intersections of y = y2 with those sides. \n\nSimilarly, the sides BC and EF are parallel to QR, and CD and FA are parallel to RP.\n\nThis might be a way to model it. Let me try this approach.\n\nFirst, let me parametrize the lines of the triangle:\n\n- Side PQ is from (0,0) to (200,0).\n\n- Side QR is from (200,0) to (x_R, y_R).\n\n- Side RP is from (x_R, y_R) to (0,0).\n\nEquations of the sides:\n\nEquation of QR: \n\nThe line from Q(200,0) to R(x_R, y_R). The slope is (y_R - 0)/(x_R - 200) = y_R/(x_R - 200). Let me compute x_R - 200 = 181 - 200 = -19. So slope is y_R / (-19) \u2248 sqrt(57239)/(-19). Let's keep it symbolic for now.\n\nThe equation can be written as:\n\ny - 0 = [y_R / (x_R - 200)] (x - 200)\n\nSimilarly, the equation for RP (from R(x_R, y_R) to P(0,0)) has slope y_R / x_R. The equation is:\n\ny = (y_R / x_R) * x\n\nNow, suppose the horizontal line y = y1 intersects QR and RP at points A and B, respectively. The segment AB is a side of the hexagon, so its length should be s.\n\nSimilarly, the horizontal line y = y2 would intersect QR and RP at points D and E, forming side DE of length s. Since AB and DE are opposite sides, they should be parallel (which they are, being horizontal) and equal in length (so the horizontal distances at y1 and y2 must be the same? Wait, no, actually DE is another side, but in the hexagon, adjacent sides are not necessarily horizontal. Wait, no, AB is horizontal, but BC would be parallel to QR. Hmm, perhaps my coordinate choice complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps better to consider the three directions:\n\nLet me consider the three pairs of parallel sides of the hexagon. Each pair is parallel to a side of the triangle, so:\n\n- Two sides parallel to PQ (horizontal in my coordinate system): let's say AB and DE.\n\n- Two sides parallel to QR: BC and EF.\n\n- Two sides parallel to RP: CD and FA.\n\nThe hexagon is formed by these six sides.\n\nTo compute the coordinates:\n\nLet me denote the horizontal lines (parallel to PQ) as y = y1 and y = y2, with y1 < y2.\n\nThe line parallel to QR (which has slope m1 = y_R / (x_R - 200)) will have the same slope. Let me denote one of these lines as line BC, which is between points B and C. Similarly, the line EF parallel to QR will be another one.\n\nSimilarly, lines parallel to RP (slope m2 = y_R / x_R) will form sides CD and FA.\n\nThe intersections of these lines will form the hexagon's vertices.\n\nTo have all sides equal, the distance between the horizontal lines y1 and y2 must be such that the length of the sides parallel to QR and RP also equal s.\n\nThis is getting complex, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let's find the coordinates of points A and B on the horizontal line y = y1:\n\nPoint A is the intersection of y = y1 with QR.\n\nEquation of QR: y = [y_R/(x_R - 200)] (x - 200)\n\nSet y = y1:\n\ny1 = [y_R/(x_R - 200)] (x_A - 200)\n\nSolving for x_A:\n\nx_A = 200 + (y1 * (x_R - 200))/y_R\n\nSimilarly, point B is the intersection of y = y1 with RP.\n\nEquation of RP: y = (y_R/x_R) x\n\nSet y = y1:\n\ny1 = (y_R/x_R) x_B \u21d2 x_B = (y1 * x_R)/y_R\n\nThus, the coordinates are:\n\nA: (200 + (y1*(x_R -200))/y_R , y1 )\n\nB: ( (y1 * x_R)/y_R , y1 )\n\nThe length of AB is the horizontal distance between A and B:\n\nAB_length = x_A - x_B = [200 + (y1*(x_R -200))/y_R] - [ (y1 * x_R)/y_R ]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= 200 + y1*(x_R -200 - x_R)/y_R\n\n= 200 + y1*(-200)/y_R\n\n= 200 - (200 y1)/y_R\n\nSo AB_length = 200*(1 - y1/y_R)\n\nSimilarly, the length of DE, which is on the line y = y2:\n\nFollowing the same steps, DE_length = 200*(1 - y2/y_R)\n\nBut since AB and DE are sides of the hexagon and must be equal to s, and also opposite sides, their lengths must be equal. However, since y2 > y1, DE_length would be less than AB_length unless y2 is adjusted in another way. Wait, but in the hexagon, AB and DE are opposite sides, so maybe they are both of length s, but positioned such that one is above the other. Wait, perhaps actually, the horizontal sides are not both on the same direction. Maybe I need to consider other directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two horizontal sides (parallel to PQ) are actually on different 'levels' but their lengths are adjusted via their y-coordinate. However, for the hexagon to be equilateral, all six sides must have the same length s, so AB_length = s and DE_length = s, which would require that:\n\n200*(1 - y1/y_R) = s,\n\nand similarly, another horizontal side (if there is another one) would also have to equal s. Wait, but in the hexagon, there are only two sides parallel to PQ (AB and DE), so their lengths must both equal s. Therefore,\n\n200*(1 - y1/y_R) = 200*(1 - y2/y_R),\n\nwhich implies y1 = y2, which can't be unless they are the same line. Contradiction. Hence, my assumption that both AB and DE are horizontal must be wrong. \n\nAh, here's the mistake: In the hexagon, each pair of opposite sides are parallel, but they are not necessarily all horizontal. Wait, in my coordinate system, I set PQ as horizontal, so sides parallel to PQ are horizontal, but sides parallel to QR and RP have other slopes. Therefore, the other pairs of sides (BC & EF, CD & FA) are not horizontal. \n\nTherefore, the two sides parallel to PQ (AB and DE) are horizontal, and their lengths depend on their y-coordinate as computed above. Since they must both be equal to s, the only way is if they are at the same height, but that would make them the same line. Contradiction again. So clearly, my approach is flawed.\n\nPerhaps the hexagon has only one pair of sides parallel to each triangle side? Wait the problem states \"all pairs of opposite sides are parallel\", so there are three pairs, each pair parallel to a side of the triangle. So each pair of opposite sides is parallel to one side of the triangle. Therefore, the two horizontal sides (parallel to PQ) must indeed be AB and DE, but they must be on different heights so that their lengths can both equal s. But according to the previous calculation, their lengths depend on their y-coordinate. To have both AB and DE length s, their y-coordinates must satisfy:\n\nFor AB at y1: s = 200*(1 - y1/y_R),\n\nFor DE at y2: s = 200*(1 - y2/y_R),\n\nTherefore, y1 = y_R*(1 - s/200),\n\nand y2 = y_R*(1 - s/200),\n\nWhich again implies y1 = y2. So contradiction. Hence, my model is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so maybe the sides parallel to PQ are not both horizontal? Wait no, if PQ is horizontal, then their parallel sides must also be horizontal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the two sides parallel to PQ are not both horizontal but in the other direction? Wait no, direction is fixed. \n\nThis suggests that my coordinate system assumption might be problematic, or I need to consider that the hexagon's opposite sides are not both lying on lines parallel to the triangle's sides but arranged differently. \n\nWait, perhaps the hexagon is such that each pair of opposite sides are parallel to a different side of the triangle. For example, AB and DE are parallel to QR, BC and EF parallel to RP, and CD and FA parallel to PQ. This way, the three pairs of opposite sides are each parallel to a different side of the triangle. This might resolve the earlier contradiction.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let's reassign:\n\n- AB and DE are parallel to QR (slope m1).\n\n- BC and EF are parallel to RP (slope m2).\n\n- CD and FA are parallel to PQ (horizontal).\n\nThis way, each pair of opposite sides are parallel to a different side of the triangle.\n\nNow, let's recast the problem with this in mind.\n\nFirst, let me recompute the slopes:\n\nQR has slope m1 = (y_R - 0)/(x_R - 200) = y_R/(x_R - 200) = sqrt(57239)/(-19) \u2248 negative slope.\n\nRP has slope m2 = (y_R - 0)/(x_R - 0) = y_R / x_R \u2248 sqrt(57239)/181 \u2248 positive slope.\n\nPQ is horizontal, slope 0.\n\nNow, let's try to define the hexagon's vertices:\n\nLet me suppose that side CD is parallel to PQ (horizontal), so CD is a horizontal line segment. Similarly, FA is another horizontal line segment opposite to CD.\n\nThe sides AB and DE are parallel to QR (with slope m1), and BC and EF are parallel to RP (slope m2).\n\nTo form a hexagon, the vertices must connect in order: A-B-C-D-E-F-A.\n\nLet me attempt to parameterize each side.\n\nLet me start by defining point A somewhere along side PQ's extension. Wait, but the hexagon is convex and inside the triangle? Or is it formed by extending the sides?\n\nWait the problem states: \"the triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF\". So the lines AB, CD, EF when extended form the triangle PQR with sides 200,240,300. Therefore, the hexagon is inside the triangle, and the lines AB, CD, EF are parts of the triangle's sides.\n\nWait no, the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF. So AB is a segment, and when extended, it becomes a side of the triangle. Similarly for CD and EF. Therefore, the hexagon is near the center of the triangle, and extending its sides AB, CD, EF forms the outer triangle.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon is inside triangle PQR, and each of its sides AB, CD, EF are parts of lines that, when extended, meet at the triangle's vertices.\n\nLet me try to think of the hexagon as follows: Each of its sides AB, CD, EF are contained within the lines that form the triangle, but only a portion of those lines. The other sides of the hexagon (BC, DE, FA) are the other sides needed to close the shape.\n\nLet me consider the lines:\n\n- Line AB is part of line PQ (since when extended, AB forms side PQ of the triangle). Wait no, the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, EF. So line AB is extended to meet line CD's extension and EF's extension at the triangle's vertices.\n\nLet me denote the triangle's vertices as follows:\n\nLet the extension of AB meet the extension of CD at point P,\n\nThe extension of CD meet the extension of EF at point Q,\n\nThe extension of EF meet the extension of AB at point R,\n\nforming triangle PQR with side lengths 200, 240, 300.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states \"the triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF\". Therefore, each side of the triangle is the extension of one of these segments. So each side of triangle PQR is colinear with AB, CD, or EF.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- One side of the triangle is the extension of AB, let's say side PR,\n\n- Another side is extension of CD, say side RQ,\n\n- Third side is extension of EF, say side QP.\n\nWait, need to clarify:\n\nLet me suppose that when we extend AB, CD, and EF, they form triangle PQR, with each side of the triangle being the extension of one of the hexagon's sides.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- Extending AB beyond A and B until they meet the extensions of CD and EF at points P and Q respectively,\n\n- Extending CD beyond C and D until they meet the extensions of EF and AB at points Q and R,\n\n- Extending EF beyond E and F until they meet the extensions of AB and CD at points R and P.\n\nThus forming triangle PQR with sides PQ, QR, RP being the extensions of AB, CD, EF respectively.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF\", so each side of the triangle is an extension of one of those segments. So each side of the triangle is colinear with AB, CD, or EF.\n\nTherefore, the triangle has three sides: one is the line containing AB extended, another is the line containing CD extended, and the third is the line containing EF extended. These three lines form a triangle when they intersect.\n\nGiven that the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, the lines AB, CD, EF must be non-adjacent and their extensions form the triangle. \n\nLet me try to model this with coordinates again, but this time with the triangle being formed by the extensions.\n\nLet me denote the triangle as PQR, with:\n\n- Side PQ being the extension of AB,\n\n- Side QR being the extension of CD,\n\n- Side RP being the extension of EF.\n\nLet me assign coordinates such that:\n\n- Let\u2019s place point A somewhere along side PQ,\n\n- Point B is another point on PQ such that AB is a side of the hexagon,\n\n- Similarly, points C, D on QR forming CD,\n\n- Points E, F on RP forming EF.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral and convex, the points A, B, C, D, E, F must be arranged such that the sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA are all of equal length s, and opposite sides are parallel.\n\nGiven that opposite sides are parallel:\n\n- AB || DE,\n\n- BC || EF,\n\n- CD || FA.\n\nSince AB is part of PQ and DE is opposite to AB, DE must be parallel to PQ, meaning DE is also along a line parallel to PQ. But PQ is a side of the triangle, so DE must be parallel to PQ but offset.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Maybe an easier approach is to use the property that in such a hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal, the triangle formed by the extensions has sides proportional to the hexagon's side length.\n\nI recall that in some cases, for a hexagon with opposite sides parallel and equal, the triangle formed by their extensions has sides equal to the hexagon's side divided by the sine of the angles between the sides. \n\nAlternatively, since all pairs of opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be considered as a combination of three parallelograms. Each pair of opposite sides forms a parallelogram with the corresponding sides of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, using vectors, suppose that the vectors of the sides of the hexagon can be expressed in terms of the triangle's sides.\n\nLet me consider the triangle PQR with sides of length 200, 240, 300. The hexagon is inside this triangle such that each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle. Let the distances between each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon be d1, d2, d3 corresponding to the sides of length 200, 240, 300 respectively.\n\nThe side length s of the hexagon can be related to these distances and the angles of the triangle.\n\nLet me denote the angles of triangle PQR as \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 opposite to sides of length 200, 240, 300 respectively. \n\nThe distance between two parallel sides (e.g., the side of length 200 and the opposite side of the hexagon) would be related to s and the angle between the other sides.\n\nSpecifically, the distance between the sides parallel to PQ (length 200) would be d1 = s * sin \u03b2 / sin(\u03b3), perhaps? Wait, not sure. Maybe using the formula for distance between parallel lines in a triangle.\n\nAlternatively, the length of the hexagon's side s is related to the sides of the triangle and the distances between the parallel sides. \n\nThe key idea might be that the triangle PQR is divided by the hexagon into three smaller parallelograms and the hexagon itself. The sides of the hexagon s are the diagonals of these parallelograms, but I need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the lines forming the hexagon divide each side of triangle PQR into segments. Let the segments along PQ be divided into lengths proportional to some ratio, and similarly for the other sides. The hexagon's sides will then form similar triangles, leading to equations that can be solved for s.\n\nLet me suppose that along each side of triangle PQR, the hexagon's vertices divide the side into two parts with a ratio of t:(1-t). For example, on side PQ of length 200, the point where the hexagon's side meets PQ divides it into t*200 and (1-t)*200. \n\nDue to the parallelism and equal side lengths, these ratios must be consistent across all sides. \n\nLet me denote the ratio parameter as t. Then, on side PQ, the division is t*200 from P and (1-t)*200 from Q. Similarly, on QR (length 240), the division is t*240 from Q and (1-t)*240 from R. On RP (length 300), the division is t*300 from R and (1-t)*300 from P.\n\nThe hexagon's sides are then formed by connecting these division points such that each side is parallel to a side of the triangle. \n\nThe length of each side of the hexagon can be computed using the sine of the angles of the triangle. \n\nFor instance, the side of the hexagon parallel to QR (which is one of the sides) would have a length equal to (1 - t)*200 * sin(angle at P) / sin(angle between QR and PQ). \n\nThis is getting too vague without concrete angles. Perhaps compute the angles of triangle PQR first.\n\nLet me compute the angles of triangle PQR using the Law of Cosines.\n\nGiven sides a = 200, b = 240, c = 300.\n\nAngle at P (opposite side QR = 240):\n\ncos \u03b1 = (a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - b\u00b2)/(2ac) = (200\u00b2 + 300\u00b2 - 240\u00b2)/(2*200*300)\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n200\u00b2 = 40000,\n\n300\u00b2 = 90000,\n\n240\u00b2 = 57600,\n\nSo numerator: 40000 + 90000 - 57600 = 130000 - 57600 = 72400,\n\nDenominator: 2*200*300 = 120000,\n\nThus cos \u03b1 = 72400 / 120000 = 0.603333...\n\nSo angle \u03b1 \u2248 arccos(0.6033) \u2248 52.9 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, angle at Q (opposite side PR = 300):\n\ncos \u03b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)/(2ab) = (200\u00b2 + 240\u00b2 - 300\u00b2)/(2*200*240)\n\nNumerator: 40000 + 57600 - 90000 = 97600 - 90000 = 7600,\n\nDenominator: 2*200*240=96000,\n\ncos \u03b2 = 7600/96000 \u2248 0.0791666,\n\nThus angle \u03b2 \u2248 arccos(0.0791666) \u2248 85.4 degrees.\n\nAngle at R (opposite side PQ = 200):\n\ncos \u03b3 = (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - a\u00b2)/(2bc) = (240\u00b2 + 300\u00b2 - 200\u00b2)/(2*240*300)\n\nNumerator: 57600 + 90000 - 40000 = 147600 - 40000 = 107600,\n\nDenominator: 2*240*300 = 144000,\n\ncos \u03b3 = 107600 / 144000 \u2248 0.7465,\n\nThus angle \u03b3 \u2248 41.7 degrees.\n\nSo angles are approximately \u03b1\u224852.9\u00b0, \u03b2\u224885.4\u00b0, \u03b3\u224841.7\u00b0.\n\nNow, returning to the ratio t. Suppose that along each side, the division is t from the vertex. The length of the hexagon's side parallel to QR would then involve the distance between the divided points, which can be calculated using the Law of Sines or Cosines in the smaller triangles.\n\nAlternatively, the length of the hexagon's side parallel to QR can be expressed as t * 200 * sin(angle at P) or something like that. Maybe it's better to use vectors.\n\nLet me consider vectors for the sides:\n\nLet\u2019s define vectors for triangle PQR. Let me place point P at the origin (0,0), Q at (200, 0), and R at coordinates (x_R, y_R) as computed earlier (181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nThe vectors:\n\n- Vector PQ = (200, 0).\n\n- Vector PR = (x_R, y_R).\n\n- Vector QR = (x_R - 200, y_R).\n\nThe hexagon has sides parallel to these vectors. Let me denote the sides of the hexagon as follows:\n\n- AB is parallel to QR,\n\n- BC is parallel to RP,\n\n- CD is parallel to PQ,\n\n- DE is parallel to QR,\n\n- EF is parallel to RP,\n\n- FA is parallel to PQ.\n\nWait, but this must form a closed hexagon. Let me think of the vertices:\n\nStarting at point A, moving along AB (parallel to QR), then BC (parallel to RP), then CD (parallel to PQ), etc.\n\nTo close the hexagon, the vectors must sum to zero:\n\nAB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = 0.\n\nSince AB is parallel to QR, let me denote AB = k1 * QR,\n\nBC = k2 * RP,\n\nCD = k3 * PQ,\n\nDE = k4 * QR,\n\nEF = k5 * RP,\n\nFA = k6 * PQ.\n\nBut since opposite sides are equal and parallel:\n\nAB = DE,\n\nBC = EF,\n\nCD = FA.\n\nTherefore:\n\nk1 = k4,\n\nk2 = k5,\n\nk3 = k6.\n\nTherefore, the vectors become:\n\nAB = k1 * QR,\n\nBC = k2 * RP,\n\nCD = k3 * PQ,\n\nDE = k1 * QR,\n\nEF = k2 * RP,\n\nFA = k3 * PQ.\n\nSumming them up:\n\nAB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA =\n\nk1 QR + k2 RP + k3 PQ + k1 QR + k2 RP + k3 PQ =\n\n2k1 QR + 2k2 RP + 2k3 PQ = 0.\n\nTherefore,\n\nk1 QR + k2 RP + k3 PQ = 0.\n\nThis vector equation must hold.\n\nExpressing vectors QR and RP in terms of PQ and PR:\n\nQR = PR - PQ,\n\nRP = -PR.\n\nSo substituting:\n\nk1 (PR - PQ) + k2 (-PR) + k3 PQ = 0,\n\nk1 PR - k1 PQ - k2 PR + k3 PQ = 0,\n\n(k1 - k2) PR + (-k1 + k3) PQ = 0.\n\nSince PR and PQ are not colinear, their coefficients must be zero:\n\nk1 - k2 = 0,\n\n-k1 + k3 = 0,\n\nThus,\n\nk2 = k1,\n\nk3 = k1.\n\nTherefore, all three coefficients k1, k2, k3 are equal. Let\u2019s denote them all as k.\n\nTherefore, the vectors become:\n\nAB = k QR,\n\nBC = k RP,\n\nCD = k PQ,\n\nDE = k QR,\n\nEF = k RP,\n\nFA = k PQ.\n\nThus, each side of the hexagon is a scalar multiple k of the respective triangle side vectors.\n\nNow, the length of each side of the hexagon must be equal to s:\n\n|AB| = |k QR| = k |QR| = k * 240 = s,\n\n|BC| = |k RP| = k |RP| = k * 300 = s,\n\n|CD| = |k PQ| = k * 200 = s.\n\nWait a minute, this implies that:\n\nk * 240 = s,\n\nk * 300 = s,\n\nk * 200 = s,\n\nwhich would require that 240 = 300 = 200, which is impossible. Contradiction.\n\nThis suggests an error in my assumption. The mistake lies in the direction of the vectors. The vectors for the hexagon's sides may be in different directions, so the coefficients could have different signs.\n\nAlternatively, the vectors must be directed such that their vector sum is zero, but their magnitudes are equal.\n\nLet me re-express the vectors with direction considered.\n\nSuppose that the hexagon\u2019s sides are in the direction of the triangle\u2019s sides but possibly opposite.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nAB is parallel to QR but could be in the opposite direction,\n\nSimilarly, BC parallel to RP,\n\nCD parallel to PQ,\n\nDE parallel to QR (same direction as QR?),\n\nEF parallel to RP,\n\nFA parallel to PQ.\n\nBut need to ensure the directions form a closed polygon.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the vectors as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define AB as a vector in the direction of QR, BC in the direction of RP, CD in the direction of PQ, and so on, but ensuring that the vectors form a closed loop.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon is convex and equilateral with opposite sides parallel, each pair of opposite sides must be both in the same direction and separated by some distance.\n\nPerhaps the key is that the vectors AB, CD, EF are all scaled versions of the triangle's sides, but in such a way that their sum closes the polygon.\n\nAlternatively, since the triangle sides are PQ, QR, RP with lengths 200,240,300, and the hexagon's sides are proportional to these but with scaling factors such that their vector sum is zero.\n\nWait, returning to the earlier vector equation:\n\nk1 QR + k2 RP + k3 PQ = 0,\n\nand with k1 = k2 = k3 = k,\n\nthen this gives k(QR + RP + PQ) = 0,\n\nBut QR + RP + PQ is the sum of the triangle's sides vectors, which is zero because they form a triangle. So indeed, this holds for any k, but this doesn't give us the scaling.\n\nWait but in the earlier analysis, if k1 = k2 = k3 = k, then each side length would be k times the triangle's side lengths, but they must all equal s, leading to inconsistency. Hence, the error is assuming that all coefficients are equal. Perhaps the coefficients have different signs?\n\nLet me try again with different signs.\n\nSuppose that:\n\nAB = k QR,\n\nBC = m RP,\n\nCD = n PQ,\n\nDE = -k QR,\n\nEF = -m RP,\n\nFA = -n PQ,\n\nso that when summed:\n\nAB + BC + CD + DE + EF + FA = (k QR - k QR) + (m RP - m RP) + (n PQ - n PQ) = 0,\n\nwhich works. Now, the lengths are:\n\n|AB| = |k| * |QR| = |k| *240,\n\n|BC| = |m| * |RP| = |m|*300,\n\n|CD| = |n| * |PQ| = |n|*200,\n\n|DE| = |k|*240,\n\n|EF| = |m|*300,\n\n|FA| = |n|*200.\n\nSince all sides must have length s,\n\nso |k|*240 = |m|*300 = |n|*200 = s.\n\nAdditionally, the hexagon must close properly, so the vectors must form a closed loop. The previous approach used the vector equation but with coefficients potentially having different signs.\n\nLet me consider the path A\u2192B\u2192C\u2192D\u2192E\u2192F\u2192A.\n\nExpressed in vectors:\n\nVector AB = k QR,\n\nVector BC = m RP,\n\nVector CD = n PQ,\n\nVector DE = -k QR,\n\nVector EF = -m RP,\n\nVector FA = -n PQ.\n\nThe total displacement is zero, which is satisfied.\n\nNow, to find the values of k, m, n such that the path is a closed polygon.\n\nHowever, we also need to ensure that the positions of the points are consistent.\n\nLet me assign coordinates with P at (0,0), Q at (200,0), R at (181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nLet's denote the coordinates of point A as some point along the extension of AB, but since AB is part of the hexagon inside the triangle, perhaps A is located along the side PQ?\n\nWait actually, since AB is parallel to QR, which is the side from Q to R, the direction of AB is the same as QR.\n\nLet me express the vectors in coordinates.\n\nQR vector is R - Q = (181 - 200, sqrt(57239) - 0) = (-19, sqrt(57239)).\n\nRP vector is P - R = (-181, -sqrt(57239)).\n\nPQ vector is Q - P = (200, 0).\n\nLet me define the vectors for the hexagon's sides:\n\nAB = k*(QR vector) = k*(-19, sqrt(57239)),\n\nBC = m*(RP vector) = m*(-181, -sqrt(57239)),\n\nCD = n*(PQ vector) = n*(200, 0),\n\nDE = -k*(QR vector) = -k*(-19, sqrt(57239)) = k*(19, -sqrt(57239)),\n\nEF = -m*(RP vector) = -m*(-181, -sqrt(57239)) = m*(181, sqrt(57239)),\n\nFA = -n*(PQ vector) = -n*(200, 0).\n\nNow, the coordinates of the points can be tracked starting from an initial point A.\n\nLet me assume point A is located at some position, say, at the origin for simplicity, but actually need to place it such that the entire hexagon is inside the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, let me start at point A and express all other points in terms of vectors.\n\nLet\u2019s denote point A as the starting point. The coordinates of subsequent points are:\n\nPoint B = A + AB = A + k*(-19, sqrt(57239)),\n\nPoint C = B + BC = A + k*(-19, sqrt(57239)) + m*(-181, -sqrt(57239)),\n\nPoint D = C + CD = A + k*(-19, sqrt(57239)) + m*(-181, -sqrt(57239)) + n*(200, 0),\n\nPoint E = D + DE = D + k*(19, -sqrt(57239)),\n\nPoint F = E + EF = D + k*(19, -sqrt(57239)) + m*(181, sqrt(57239)),\n\nPoint A' = F + FA = F - n*(200, 0).\n\nSince it's a hexagon, point A' must coincide with the original point A, giving equations:\n\nA' = A \u21d2 F - n*(200,0) = A \u21d2 F = A + n*(200,0).\n\nNow, substituting F from above:\n\nD + k*(19, -sqrt(57239)) + m*(181, sqrt(57239)) = A + n*(200,0).\n\nSubstituting D:\n\n[D = A + ...] Let me substitute step by step.\n\nLet me express F step by step:\n\nStarting from D:\n\nD = A + k*(-19, sqrt(57239)) + m*(-181, -sqrt(57239)) + n*(200, 0).\n\nThen,\n\nE = D + DE = D + k*(19, -sqrt(57239)),\n\n= A + k*(-19 +19) + m*(-181, -sqrt(57239)) + n*(200,0) + k*(0,0) ?\n\nWait, let me do this more carefully component-wise:\n\nLet me denote coordinates as (x, y).\n\nLet me track each component:\n\nLet\u2019s define A as (x_A, y_A).\n\nThen,\n\nB = A + AB = (x_A -19k, y_A + k*sqrt(57239)),\n\nC = B + BC = (x_A -19k -181m, y_A + k*sqrt(57239) - m*sqrt(57239)),\n\nD = C + CD = (x_A -19k -181m + 200n, y_A + (k - m)*sqrt(57239)),\n\nE = D + DE = (x_A -19k -181m + 200n +19k, y_A + (k - m)*sqrt(57239) - k*sqrt(57239)),\n\nSimplifying E:\n\nx_E = x_A -181m + 200n,\n\ny_E = y_A + (k - m -k)*sqrt(57239) = y_A - m*sqrt(57239),\n\nF = E + EF = (x_A -181m + 200n +181m, y_A - m*sqrt(57239) + m*sqrt(57239)),\n\nSimplifying F:\n\nx_F = x_A + 200n,\n\ny_F = y_A,\n\nFinally, FA vector is added to F to get back to A:\n\nA' = F + FA = (x_A + 200n -200n, y_A - 0) = (x_A, y_A),\n\nwhich matches A. Therefore, the equations are consistent for any k, m, n. Thus, there are infinitely many solutions, but we need to enforce that the hexagon lies inside the triangle and that all its sides have length s.\n\nThe lengths of the sides are:\n\n|AB| = sqrt( (-19k)^2 + (k*sqrt(57239))^2 ) = k*sqrt(19\u00b2 + 57239) = k*sqrt(361 + 57239) = k*sqrt(57600) = k*240,\n\nWhich matches earlier.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|BC| = sqrt( (-181m)^2 + (-m*sqrt(57239))^2 ) = m*sqrt(181\u00b2 + 57239),\n\nCompute 181\u00b2: 181*181 = 32761,\n\nThus sqrt(32761 + 57239) = sqrt(90000) = 300,\n\nSo |BC| = m*300,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|CD| = sqrt( (200n)^2 +0 ) = 200n.\n\nTherefore, the side lengths are:\n\nAB: 240k,\n\nBC: 300m,\n\nCD: 200n,\n\nDE: 240k,\n\nEF: 300m,\n\nFA: 200n.\n\nSince all sides are equal to s,\n\n240k = 300m = 200n = s,\n\nTherefore,\n\nk = s/240,\n\nm = s/300,\n\nn = s/200.\n\nNow, we must also ensure that the hexagon is convex and lies inside the triangle PQR. The coordinates of the points must satisfy the triangle's boundaries.\n\nLet me consider the coordinates of the points in terms of s:\n\nLet me choose point A such that it's located along PQ. Since PQ is from (0,0) to (200,0), let me set A at (a, 0), where 0 < a < 200.\n\nThen:\n\nPoint A = (a, 0),\n\nPoint B = (a -19k, 0 + k*sqrt(57239)),\n\nPoint C = (a -19k -181m, k*sqrt(57239) - m*sqrt(57239)),\n\nPoint D = (a -19k -181m + 200n, (k - m)*sqrt(57239)),\n\nPoint E = (a -181m + 200n, -m*sqrt(57239)),\n\nPoint F = (a + 200n, 0).\n\nNow, since the hexagon must be convex and lie inside triangle PQR, all points must be inside the triangle. Also, the coordinates must satisfy the triangle's inequalities.\n\nLet me focus on point D, which has y-coordinate (k - m)*sqrt(57239). Since the hexagon is convex and inside the triangle, this y-coordinate must be positive (since the triangle's apex is at y_R = sqrt(57239)), so:\n\n(k - m) > 0 \u21d2 k > m \u21d2 s/240 > s/300 \u21d2 1/240 > 1/300, which is true. So that's okay.\n\nSimilarly, other coordinates must be within the triangle's bounds.\n\nAdditionally, the points must lie on the respective sides or within the triangle.\n\nHowever, since the problem states that the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF, we need to ensure that the lines AB, CD, EF when extended form the triangle PQR.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe line AB is from point A to B. Its extension should meet the extension of CD and EF at the triangle's vertices.\n\nSimilarly for other lines.\n\nLet me find the intersection points of the extended sides to form triangle PQR.\n\nFirst, find where AB extended meets CD extended.\n\nThe line AB has direction vector QR: (-19, sqrt(57239)),\n\nParametrized as A + t*(-19, sqrt(57239)).\n\nThe line CD has direction vector PQ: (200, 0),\n\nParametrized as D + s*(200,0).\n\nWait this might be complex. Alternatively, since we know the triangle's vertices are the intersections of the extended sides, we can set up equations for the vertices.\n\nLet me denote the vertices of the triangle PQR as follows:\n\n- P is the intersection of AB extended and EF extended,\n\n- Q is the intersection of CD extended and AB extended? No, need to clarify.\n\nActually, according to the problem statement, the triangle is formed by the extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF. So each side of the triangle is the extension of one of these segments.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Side PQ of the triangle is the extension of AB,\n\n- Side QR is the extension of CD,\n\n- Side RP is the extension of EF.\n\nWait, but the naming might vary. Let me assume:\n\nLet P be the intersection of AB extended and CD extended,\n\nQ be the intersection of CD extended and EF extended,\n\nR be the intersection of EF extended and AB extended.\n\nThus forming triangle PQR.\n\nWait, but need to ensure the sides are correct. Alternatively, each side of the triangle is the extension of one segment:\n\n- The extension of AB forms one side,\n\n- The extension of CD forms another,\n\n- The extension of EF forms the third.\n\nTherefore, the three lines AB, CD, EF, when extended, meet pairwise at the triangle's vertices.\n\nLet me compute the intersection points:\n\nLet me find where AB extended meets CD extended: this is point P,\n\nCD extended meets EF extended: point Q,\n\nEF extended meets AB extended: point R.\n\nWait, but need to ensure the sides are correctly labeled.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the intersection points using the parametric equations.\n\nFirst, find intersection of line AB and line CD.\n\nLine AB: from A(a, 0) to B(a -19k, k\u221a57239). Direction vector: (-19k, k\u221a57239). Wait, actually, the direction vector is (-19, \u221a57239) scaled by k.\n\nParametric equation for line AB:\n\n(x, y) = (a, 0) + t*(-19, \u221a57239).\n\nLine CD: from point C to D. The direction of CD is PQ direction (200,0).\n\nWait, point C is (a -19k -181m, (k - m)\u221a57239),\n\nPoint D is (a -19k -181m + 200n, (k - m)\u221a57239).\n\nSo the vector CD is (200n, 0). Thus, the line CD is horizontal at y = (k - m)\u221a57239, extending from C to D.\n\nWait, so line CD is the line y = (k - m)\u221a57239, since it's parallel to PQ (horizontal).\n\nTherefore, the line AB (parametric) and line CD (horizontal line) intersect at point P.\n\nSet the y-coordinate of AB to equal (k - m)\u221a57239:\n\n0 + t*(\u221a57239) = (k - m)\u221a57239 \u21d2 t = k - m.\n\nThen the x-coordinate at intersection P is:\n\nx = a + t*(-19) = a -19(k - m).\n\nSimilarly, the y-coordinate is (k - m)\u221a57239.\n\nTherefore, point P is (a -19(k - m), (k - m)\u221a57239).\n\nSimilarly, find intersection of line CD and line EF.\n\nLine CD is horizontal at y = (k - m)\u221a57239,\n\nLine EF is from point E to F. The direction of EF is the same as RP vector scaled by m.\n\nWait, EF's direction is m*(181, \u221a57239). Wait earlier calculations:\n\nEF vector is m*(181, \u221a57239).\n\nPoint E is (a -181m + 200n, -m\u221a57239),\n\nPoint F is (a + 200n, 0).\n\nSo the line EF can be parametrized as E + s*(181, \u221a57239).\n\nWait, the direction vector is (181, \u221a57239).\n\nWe need to find where this line intersects CD's line y = (k - m)\u221a57239.\n\nSet the y-coordinate:\n\ny = -m\u221a57239 + s*\u221a57239 = (k - m)\u221a57239,\n\nThus,\n\ns*\u221a57239 = (k - m)\u221a57239 + m\u221a57239 \u21d2 s\u221a57239 = k\u221a57239 \u21d2 s = k.\n\nThen the x-coordinate at intersection Q is:\n\nx = (a -181m + 200n) + s*181 = a -181m + 200n + 181k.\n\nThus, point Q is (a -181m + 200n + 181k, (k - m)\u221a57239).\n\nFinally, find intersection of line EF and line AB to get point R.\n\nLine EF: parametrized as E + s*(181, \u221a57239).\n\nLine AB: parametrized as (a,0) + t*(-19, \u221a57239).\n\nSet them equal:\n\na + s*181 = a -19t,\n\n0 + s*\u221a57239 = 0 + t*\u221a57239.\n\nFrom the y-coordinate: s = t.\n\nSubstitute into x-coordinate:\n\na + 181s = a -19s \u21d2 181s +19s = 0 \u21d2 200s =0 \u21d2 s=0.\n\nThis gives the trivial intersection at point A. Not useful.\n\nWait, perhaps need to extend line EF beyond its segment.\n\nWait line EF is from E to F, but when extended, it can be parametrized with s beyond 0 to 1.\n\nWait, let me re-parametrize line EF beyond its endpoints.\n\nAlternatively, recomputing intersection between AB and EF beyond the segments:\n\nWe have:\n\nLine AB: (x,y) = (a -19t, 0 + t\u221a57239).\n\nLine EF: (x,y) = (a -181m + 200n + 181s, -m\u221a57239 + s\u221a57239).\n\nSet equal:\n\na -19t = a -181m + 200n + 181s,\n\nt\u221a57239 = -m\u221a57239 + s\u221a57239 \u21d2 t = -m + s.\n\nSubstitute t = s - m into the first equation:\n\na -19(s - m) = a -181m + 200n + 181s,\n\nExpand:\n\na -19s +19m = a -181m + 200n + 181s,\n\nCancel a:\n\n-19s +19m = -181m +200n +181s,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-19s +19m +181m -200n -181s =0,\n\n(19m +181m) + (-19s -181s) -200n =0,\n\n200m -200s -200n =0,\n\nDivide by 200:\n\nm - s -n =0 \u21d2 s= m - n.\n\nThen, substituting back into t = s -m,\n\nt = (m -n) -m = -n.\n\nThus, the intersection point is at parameter s = m -n for line EF:\n\nx = a -181m +200n +181*(m -n) = a -181m +200n +181m -181n = a + (200n -181n) = a +19n,\n\ny = -m\u221a57239 + (m -n)\u221a57239 = (-m +m -n)\u221a57239 = -n\u221a57239.\n\nBut this point must coincide with point R of the triangle, which should be the third vertex.\n\nHowever, the coordinates of point R in the triangle are supposed to be (181, sqrt(57239)), but according to this, it's (a +19n, -n\u221a57239). This must be equal to the triangle's vertex R, but this seems inconsistent unless we've made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps my assumption about which lines form which sides is incorrect. Alternatively, the vertices of the triangle PQR should be the intersections as computed, and their distances must be 200,240,300.\n\nLet me compute the distances between the computed vertices P, Q, and R (the third intersection point).\n\nFirst, we have:\n\nPoint P: (a -19(k - m), (k - m)\u221a57239),\n\nPoint Q: (a -181m +200n +181k, (k - m)\u221a57239),\n\nPoint R: (a +19n, -n\u221a57239).\n\nNow, compute the distances between these points and set them equal to 200, 240, 300.\n\nFirst, distance PQ:\n\nCoordinates of P and Q:\n\nP: (a -19(k - m), (k - m)\u221a57239),\n\nQ: (a -181m + 200n +181k, (k - m)\u221a57239),\n\nThe y-coordinates are the same, so distance PQ is difference in x-coordinates:\n\n\u0394x = [a -181m + 200n +181k] - [a -19(k - m)]\n\nSimplify:\n\n= a -181m +200n +181k -a +19k -19m\n\n= (-181m -19m) + (181k +19k) +200n\n\n= -200m +200k +200n\n\n= 200(k - m + n)\n\nThe distance PQ should be 200, 240, or 300. Let's see which corresponds.\n\nSimilarly, distance QR:\n\nCoordinates:\n\nQ: (a -181m +200n +181k, (k - m)\u221a57239),\n\nR: (a +19n, -n\u221a57239),\n\n\u0394x = a +19n - [a -181m +200n +181k] = a +19n -a +181m -200n -181k = 181m -181k -181n,\n\n\u0394y = -n\u221a57239 - (k - m)\u221a57239 = -n\u221a57239 -k\u221a57239 +m\u221a57239 = (-k +m -n)\u221a57239,\n\nThus distance QR is sqrt[(181(m -k -n))\u00b2 + ( (-k +m -n)*\u221a57239 )\u00b2].\n\nThis expression seems complex. Perhaps we can find relations using the known side lengths.\n\nLet me recall that the sides of the triangle PQR are 200, 240, 300, but we need to assign which computed distance corresponds to which length.\n\nAssuming that PQ corresponds to one of the triangle's sides. Let's suppose that PQ is the side of length 200. Then:\n\n200(k - m + n) = 200 \u21d2 k -m +n =1,\n\nSimilarly, let's assume QR is 240 or 300. Alternatively, this is getting too involved.\n\nPerhaps instead of keeping variables a, k, m, n, we can use the relationships between k, m, n from the side lengths.\n\nRecall that:\n\nk = s/240,\n\nm = s/300,\n\nn = s/200.\n\nLet me substitute these into the equations.\n\nLet me denote s as the side length, so:\n\nk = s/240,\n\nm = s/300,\n\nn = s/200.\n\nNow, substituting into the expression for PQ distance:\n\nPQ distance = 200(k - m + n) = 200*( s/240 - s/300 + s/200 ).\n\nCompute the terms inside:\n\nConvert to common denominator 1200:\n\ns/240 = 5s/1200,\n\n-s/300 = -4s/1200,\n\ns/200 = 6s/1200,\n\nTotal: (5s -4s +6s)/1200 = 7s/1200,\n\nThus PQ distance = 200*(7s/1200) = (200*7s)/1200 = (1400s)/1200 = (7s)/6.\n\nThis distance PQ must be equal to one of the triangle's sides, say 200, 240, or 300.\n\nSimilarly, compute QR distance:\n\nFirst, compute \u0394x and \u0394y with substitutions:\n\n\u0394x = 181*(m -k -n)\n\n= 181*(s/300 - s/240 - s/200),\n\nConvert to common denominator 1200:\n\ns/300 =4s/1200,\n\n-s/240 =-5s/1200,\n\n-s/200 =-6s/1200,\n\nTotal inside: 4s -5s -6s = -7s \u21d2 \u0394x =181*(-7s)/1200 = -1267s/1200,\n\n\u0394y = (-k +m -n)*\u221a57239,\n\n= (-s/240 + s/300 - s/200)*\u221a57239,\n\nConvert to 1200 denominator:\n\n-5s/1200 +4s/1200 -6s/1200 = (-7s)/1200,\n\nThus \u0394y = (-7s/1200)*\u221a57239,\n\nThus QR distance is sqrt[ (\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2 ]:\n\n= sqrt[ ( ( -1267s/1200 )^2 + ( -7s\u221a57239 /1200 )^2 ) ]\n\nFactor out (s/1200)^2:\n\n= (s/1200) * sqrt( 1267\u00b2 + (7\u221a57239)^2 )\n\nCompute inside sqrt:\n\n1267\u00b2 + 49*57239,\n\nFirst compute 1267\u00b2:\n\n1267\u00b2 = (1200 +67)^2 = 1200\u00b2 + 2*1200*67 +67\u00b2 = 1,440,000 + 160,800 + 4,489 = 1,440,000 +160,800=1,600,800 +4,489=1,605,289,\n\n49*57239 = 49*(57000+239)=49*57000=2,793,000 +49*239=49*(200+39)=9800+1911=11,711 \u21d2 total 2,793,000+11,711=2,804,711,\n\nTotal inside sqrt: 1,605,289 +2,804,711 = 4,410,000,\n\nThus sqrt(4,410,000)=2100,\n\nTherefore QR distance = (s/1200)*2100 = (2100/1200)s = (7/4)s.\n\nSimilarly, compute PR distance (distance between P and R):\n\nPoint P: (a -19(k - m), (k - m)\u221a57239),\n\nPoint R: (a +19n, -n\u221a57239),\n\n\u0394x = a +19n - [a -19(k - m)] =19n +19(k -m) =19(k -m +n),\n\n\u0394y = -n\u221a57239 - (k -m)\u221a57239 = -\u221a57239 (n +k -m),\n\nThus distance PR is sqrt[ (19(k -m +n))\u00b2 + (\u221a57239 ( - (k -m +n)))\u00b2 ]\n\nFactor out (k -m +n)^2:\n\n= |k -m +n| * sqrt(19\u00b2 +57239),\n\nAs before sqrt(19\u00b2+57239)=240,\n\nThus distance PR = |k -m +n| *240.\n\nBut from earlier, k -m +n = (s/240 - s/300 +s/200)=7s/1200*1200/ something? Wait earlier calculation:\n\nk -m +n = (s/240 - s/300 + s/200) = 7s/1200 * 1200/s? No, wait:\n\nWait 7s/1200 is the value for k -m +n? Wait earlier:\n\nYes, k -m +n = (5s -4s +6s)/1200 =7s/1200,\n\nThus distance PR = (7s/1200)*240 = (7s/1200)*240 = (7s *240)/1200 = (7s)/5.\n\nSo now we have expressions for all three sides of triangle PQR in terms of s:\n\nPQ = 7s/6,\n\nQR = 7s/4,\n\nPR = 7s/5.\n\nThe triangle PQR must have sides of length 200, 240, 300. Therefore, these expressions must equal those lengths in some order.\n\nWe need to assign PQ, QR, PR to 200,240,300 such that the ratios hold.\n\nLet me list the expressions:\n\nPQ = 7s/6,\n\nQR = 7s/4,\n\nPR =7s/5.\n\nLet me compute the ratios between them:\n\nPQ : QR : PR = (7s/6) : (7s/4) : (7s/5) = (1/6) : (1/4) : (1/5).\n\nTo make it easier, multiply each by 60 to eliminate denominators:\n\n10 : 15 : 12.\n\nSo the sides are in the ratio 10:15:12.\n\nThe given triangle sides are 200,240,300, which simplify to ratios 200:240:300 = 10:12:15 (divided by 20).\n\nWait, 200:240:300 simplifies by dividing by 20 to 10:12:15,\n\nBut our computed ratios are 10:15:12 (PQ:QR:PR). These are different.\n\nWait, unless we assigned the sides to different labels.\n\nThe computed ratios are 10:15:12 (PQ:QR:PR),\n\nBut the problem's triangle has sides 200,240,300, which are in the ratio 10:12:15.\n\nSo to match, we need to assign:\n\nPQ = 10k,\n\nQR =12k,\n\nPR =15k,\n\nBut our computed ratios are PQ=10 parts, QR=15 parts, PR=12 parts. So they are different.\n\nThis suggests a mismatch, meaning our assumption about which side corresponds to which expression might be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps QR corresponds to a different side.\n\nSuppose instead that:\n\nPQ corresponds to 200 \u2192 7s/6 =200,\n\nQR corresponds to 240 \u21927s/4 =240,\n\nPR corresponds to 300 \u21927s/5 =300.\n\nThen check if these are consistent:\n\nFrom PQ: s = (200 *6)/7 \u2248 171.43,\n\nFrom QR: s = (240 *4)/7 \u2248 137.14,\n\nFrom PR: s= (300 *5)/7 \u2248214.29,\n\nInconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, assign:\n\nPQ =300 \u21927s/6 =300 \u21d2 s= (300*6)/7\u2248257.14,\n\nQR=200 \u21927s/4=200 \u21d2 s= (200*4)/7\u2248114.29,\n\nPR=240 \u21d27s/5=240 \u21d2 s\u2248171.43,\n\nStill inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, assign PR=300,\n\nQR=240,\n\nPQ=200,\n\nThen:\n\nPQ=7s/6=200 \u21d2 s= (200*6)/7 \u2248171.43,\n\nQR=7s/4=7*(200*6/7)/4= (200*6)/4=300 \u21d2 which contradicts QR being 240,\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my assumption of the correspondence of the points is incorrect. Maybe the computed distances PQ, QR, PR don't directly correspond to the given triangle sides.\n\nAlternatively, the triangle sides are permutations based on which edges are chosen.\n\nWait the problem states \"the triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF\". The sides of the triangle are the extensions of those segments, so each side of the triangle corresponds to one of AB, CD, or EF extended.\n\nTherefore, the lengths of the triangle's sides are the lengths of the extended sides AB, CD, EF when extended to form the triangle.\n\nWait the length of side PQ (the extension of AB) is the length between the two points where AB meets the other extensions, which is the distance PQ we computed earlier as 7s/6.\n\nSimilarly, the extension of CD forms side QR with length 7s/4,\n\nAnd extension of EF forms side PR with length7s/5.\n\nThe problem states that these lengths are 200,240,300 in some order.\n\nTherefore, we can set:\n\n7s/6 = 200,\n\n7s/4 = 240,\n\n7s/5 = 300,\n\nand see which one gives consistent s.\n\nTesting:\n\nFirst equation:\n\n7s/6 =200 \u21d2 s= (200*6)/7 \u2248171.43,\n\nSecond equation: 7s/4=240 \u21d2 s= (240*4)/7 \u2248137.14 \u2192 inconsistent.\n\nSecond possibility:\n\n7s/6 =240 \u21d2 s=240*6/7\u2248205.71,\n\n7s/4=200 \u21d2 s= 200*4/7\u2248114.29 \u2192 inconsistent.\n\nThird possibility:\n\n7s/6=300 \u21d2 s=300*6/7\u2248257.14,\n\n7s/4=200 \u21d2 s=200*4/7\u2248114.29\u2192 nope.\n\nAlternatively, assign:\n\n7s/6=240 \u21d2 s=240*6/7\u2248205.71,\n\n7s/4=300 \u21d2 s=300*4/7\u2248171.43\u2192 no.\n\nHmm, none of these directly give consistent s. Therefore, my assumption must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle sides are not in the order I assigned.\n\nSuppose:\n\nPQ =7s/6 corresponds to 300,\n\nQR=7s/4 corresponds to240,\n\nPR=7s/5 corresponds to200.\n\nThen,\n\nPQ=7s/6=300 \u21d2 s= (300*6)/7 \u2248257.14,\n\nQR=7*(257.14)/4= (1799.98)/4\u2248449.995, which is not 240,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively,\n\nPQ=240,\n\nQR=300,\n\nPR=200,\n\nThen,\n\n7s/6=240 \u21d2 s=240*6/7\u2248205.71,\n\n7s/4=7*(205.71)/4\u2248359.995 not 300,\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. It seems the ratios don't align with the given side lengths unless there's a different approach.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps the sides of the triangle are the lengths of the extensions, which are the lengths of the lines from the intersection points, meaning the full length from P to Q is the length of AB extended, which is not just PQ distance but the full length between the vertices.\n\nWait in my earlier calculation, I computed the distance between points P and Q as 7s/6, which would be one side of the triangle. If this is supposed to be 200, 240, or 300, then we can set each possible and solve for s.\n\nLet me consider that the three computed distances (7s/6, 7s/4, 7s/5) must be equal to 200,240,300 in some order. Thus:\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n7s/6 = a,\n\n7s/4 = b,\n\n7s/5 = c,\n\nwhere {a,b,c} = {200,240,300} in some permutation.\n\nWe need to find s such that these three equations with the three values can be satisfied.\n\nLet me express s in terms of each:\n\ns = (6/7)a,\n\ns = (4/7)b,\n\ns = (5/7)c.\n\nThus,\n\n(6/7)a = (4/7)b \u21d2 6a =4b \u21d2 3a=2b \u21d2 b= (3/2)a,\n\nSimilarly, (4/7)b = (5/7)c \u21d24b=5c \u21d2 c= (4/5)b,\n\nSubstitute b from above:\n\nc= (4/5)*(3/2)a = (6/5)a.\n\nThus, the three sides must be in the ratio a : (3/2)a : (6/5)a.\n\nSimplify the ratio:\n\nMultiply by 10 to eliminate denominators:\n\n10a : 15a : 12a \u21d2 10:15:12.\n\nAs before.\n\nThe problem's triangle has sides 200,240,300, which simplify to ratios 10:12:15.\n\nSo the computed ratios are 10:15:12 versus problem's 10:12:15. These are different.\n\nTo make them match, the triangle's side lengths must be a permutation that can accommodate the ratios.\n\nFor instance, if the triangle's sides are 200 (10), 300 (15), and 240 (12), then the ratio is 10:15:12, which matches the computed ratios.\n\nThus, we can assign:\n\nPQ = 10 parts =200,\n\nQR =15 parts =300,\n\nPR=12 parts=240.\n\nTherefore,\n\nSetting 7s/6 =200 (PQ),\n\n7s/4 =300 (QR),\n\n7s/5 =240 (PR).\n\nCheck s from first equation:\n\ns= (200*6)/7 \u2248171.428...\n\nSecond equation: 7s/4 =300 \u21d2 s= (300*4)/7\u2248171.428...,\n\nThird equation: 7s/5=240 \u21d2 s= (240*5)/7\u2248171.428...\n\nAll three give s= 1200/7 \u2248171.42857.\n\nThus, the side length s is 1200/7, which is approximately 171.42857.\n\nSince the problem asks for an integer, but 1200 divided by 7 is not an integer. This suggests an error in my calculations.\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in assigning which computed distance corresponds to which triangle's side.\n\nWait if I instead assign:\n\nPQ (7s/6) =300,\n\nQR (7s/4)=240,\n\nPR (7s/5)=200,\n\nThen,\n\nFrom PQ: s= (300\u00d76)/7=1800/7\u2248257.14,\n\nQR:7*(1800/7)/4= 1800/4=450\u2260240,\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively,\n\nPQ=240 \u21d2 s=240\u00d76/7,\n\nQR=300 \u21d2 s=300\u00d74/7,\n\n240\u00d76/7 must equal 300\u00d74/7,\n\n240\u00d76 = 1440,\n\n300\u00d74=1200,\n\n1440\u22601200.\n\nNo.\n\nThe only consistent assignment is when the triangle sides are 200, 300, 240 in the order PQ=200, QR=300, PR=240, which gives s=1200/7.\n\nBut since the problem states the triangle has sides 200,240,300, this must be the correct value, even if non-integer. Wait, but the problem says \"Find the side length of the hexagon\". It didn't specify it must be integer, but the given triangle sides are integers, so maybe my mistake is in the ratio.\n\nWait let me recheck the calculation of the distances:\n\nWe had:\n\nPQ distance was 200*(k - m +n),\n\nBut wait, let me re-derive that:\n\nEarlier, I computed PQ distance as 200(k - m +n). With k = s/240, m = s/300, n = s/200,\n\nThus,\n\nk -m +n = s/240 -s/300 +s/200,\n\nConvert to common denominator 1200,\n\n= 5s/1200 -4s/1200 +6s/1200 =7s/1200,\n\nThus PQ distance is 200*(7s/1200) = (1400s)/1200 =7s/6,\n\nYes.\n\nSimilarly QR distance was sqrt( (\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2 ) which simplified to 7s/4,\n\nAnd PR distance was 7s/5,\n\nSo these are correct.\n\nGiven the triangle sides must be 200, 240, 300, so the only way is to have s = (200 \u00d7 6)/7,\n\nWhich is 1200/7 \u2248 171.428..., but since the problem might expect an integer, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in the vector direction assumptions.\n\nWait let me check the assumption that the vectors AB, BC, etc. are in the directions of the triangle's sides. Perhaps they are in the opposite direction, changing signs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the coefficients have different signs. Let me revisit the vector equation.\n\nPreviously, I assumed:\n\nAB =k QR,\n\nBC =m RP,\n\nCD =n PQ,\n\nDE =-k QR,\n\nEF =-m RP,\n\nFA =-n PQ,\n\nBut maybe the directions are different. For instance, CD might be in the opposite direction.\n\nSuppose instead that CD is in the direction opposite to PQ, so CD = -n PQ,\n\nSimilarly, then the vectors would be:\n\nAB =k QR,\n\nBC =m RP,\n\nCD =-n PQ,\n\nDE =-k QR,\n\nEF =-m RP,\n\nFA =n PQ,\n\nThis would give the same side lengths, but the vector sum would still be zero.\n\nHowever, recomputing the distances with this might change the ratios.\n\nWait actually, the side lengths remain the same because magnitudes are considered. So the ratio relations would still hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle's sides are assigned differently.\n\nWait in my previous assignment, the triangle sides computed were PQ=7s/6, QR=7s/4, PR=7s/5,\n\nWhich are in the ratio 10:15:12 when scaled appropriately.\n\nThe problem's triangle has sides 200,240,300, which can be scaled down by dividing by 20 to get 10,12,15,\n\nSo if the computed ratios are 10:15:12, then the triangle sides must be scaled by 20 to get 200, 300, 240,\n\nHence the side lengths would be:\n\nPQ=10\u00d720=200,\n\nQR=15\u00d720=300,\n\nPR=12\u00d720=240,\n\nThus, this matches the problem's triangle sides of 200,300,240,\n\nTherefore, the value of s is computed as follows:\n\nTaking PQ=200 =7s/6 \u21d2 s= (200\u00d76)/7 =1200/7,\n\nWhich is the side length of the hexagon.\n\nBut the problem says the triangle has sides 200,240,300. So if the triangle sides are 200, 240, 300, then according to my calculation, the only possible assignment is that the computed sides must be 200, 240, 300 in the order PQ=200, PR=240, QR=300,\n\nHence, s=1200/7,\n\nWhich is approximately 171.428..., but the problem might require an exact fraction or maybe I made a mistake in the setup.\n\nWait, but the problem states the triangle has sides 200,240,300. If my computed ratios are 10:15:12, then 200:300:240 are in the ratio 10:15:12, so the triangle with sides 200,300,240 would work, and the hexagon's side length is 1200/7. \n\nBut 1200 divided by 7 is approximately 171.428..., which is a fraction. Since the problem might expect an integer, perhaps I made an error in calculation.\n\nWait let me recheck the distance QR:\n\n\u0394x was found as -1267s/1200,\n\n\u0394y as -7s\u221a57239 /1200,\n\nThen QR distance was sqrt( (\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2 ) = sqrt( ( (1267)^2 + (7\u221a57239)^2 )*(s/1200)^2 ),\n\nInside the sqrt: (1267\u00b2 + 49\u00d757239),\n\nWait 1267 squared:\n\nLet me recompute 1267\u00b2:\n\n1267 \u00d7 1267:\n\nCalculate 1200\u00b2 =1,440,000,\n\n2\u00d71200\u00d767=1,572,000? Wait no,\n\nWait (a + b)^2 = a\u00b2 + 2ab +b\u00b2,\n\nwhere a=1200, b=67,\n\nThus 1267\u00b2 = (1200+67)^2 =1200\u00b2 + 2\u00d71200\u00d767 +67\u00b2,\n\n1200\u00b2=1,440,000,\n\n2\u00d71200\u00d767= 2\u00d71200\u00d760 +2\u00d71200\u00d77= 144000 + 16,800 =160,800,\n\n67\u00b2=4,489,\n\nTotal: 1,440,000 + 160,800 = 1,600,800 +4,489=1,605,289.\n\nThen 49\u00d757239:\n\nFirst compute 57239\u00d749:\n\n57239\u00d750=2,861,950,\n\nSubtract 57239: 2,861,950 -57,239 =2,804,711,\n\nThus total inside sqrt is 1,605,289 +2,804,711 =4,410,000,\n\nsqrt(4,410,000)=2100,\n\nThus QR distance is (s/1200)*2100 = (7/4)s,\n\nThis is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for PR distance:\n\n\u0394x and \u0394y led to 19*(k\u2212m+n) and \u221a57239*(\u2212(k\u2212m+n)),\n\nThe distance was |k\u2212m+n|*240,\n\nWith k\u2212m+n =7s/1200,\n\nThus PR distance=(7s/1200)*240= (7s/5),\n\nYes.\n\nSo calculations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the side length is s=1200/7.\n\nBut the problem might require an integer answer. Perhaps I have a miscalculation.\n\nWait 1200 divided by 7 is exactly 171 and 3/7, which is approximately 171.428..., which is not integer.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the vector direction or assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle sides are assigned differently.\n\nSuppose that the side labeled as 300 in the problem corresponds to the computed PR=7s/5,\n\nSo set 7s/5=300 \u21d2 s=(300\u00d75)/7\u2248214.2857,\n\nThen PQ=7s/6=7*(214.2857)/6\u2248250,\n\nQR=7s/4\u2248245,\n\nBut the given sides are 200,240,300, which don't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial coordinate setup was the issue.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the hexagon's side length is indeed 1200/7, which is approximately 171.428..., and the problem accepts fractional answers? But the problem says \"Put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", and usually expects an integer. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the assumption that all sides of the hexagon are proportional to the triangle's sides scaled by k, m, n. Perhaps there's a different approach.\n\nWait, let me think of the triangle and the hexagon in terms of similar triangles.\n\nLet me denote the three sides of the triangle as a=200, b=240, c=300.\n\nThe hexagon inside has each pair of opposite sides parallel to the triangle's sides.\n\nThe distance between the parallel sides (e.g., between AB and DE parallel to PQ) is such that the hexagon's side s relates to the triangle's side via some ratio.\n\nLet me consider that the hexagon's side parallel to PQ (length a=200) has length s, and the distance between this side and PQ is d1,\n\nSimilarly for the other sides.\n\nThe length of the side parallel to PQ would be s = a*(1 - k),\n\nWhere k is the fraction of the triangle's height from the base PQ to the hexagon's side.\n\nSimilarly, the other sides would have lengths s = b*(1 - l),\n\nand s = c*(1 - m),\n\nwith l and m being fractions of height in other directions.\n\nBut since all s are equal,\n\na*(1 -k ) = b*(1 -l ) = c*(1 -m ) = s,\n\nand also, the distances must satisfy some relation based on the triangle's angles.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of similar triangles, the hexagon reduces each side by a factor.\n\nLet me suppose that the hexagon is formed by cutting the triangle with three lines parallel to the sides, each at a distance such that the remaining small triangles at the corners are similar to the original.\n\nLet the scaling factors for the three small triangles be x, y, z.\n\nThen, the sides of the hexagon would be:\n\nBetween the triangle scaled by x and y: a*(1 -x -y),\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the side length s of the hexagon is related to the triangle's sides by the formula:\n\n1/s = 1/200 + 1/240 +1/300,\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the reciprocal of the side length of the hexagon is the sum of the reciprocals of the triangle's sides:\n\n1/s = 1/200 + 1/240 + 1/300,\n\nCalculates to (6 +5 +4)/1200=15/1200=1/80 \u21d2 s=80,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the side length is the harmonic mean: 3/(1/200 +1/240 +1/300)= 3/(15/1200)= 3*(1200/15)= 240,\n\nBut that's one of the triangle sides.\n\nAlternatively, the side length is the geometric mean: (200\u00d7240\u00d7300)^(1/3)= (14,400,000)^(1/3)\u2248244. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for a hexagon inscribed in a triangle with parallel sides: s = (a*b*c)/(ab + bc + ca),\n\nWhich would be (200\u00d7240\u00d7300)/(200\u00d7240 +240\u00d7300 +300\u00d7200)= (14,400,000)/(48,000 +72,000 +60,000)=14,400,000/180,000=80.\n\nHmm, so 80.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this formula is correct.\n\nLet me see:\n\nIf s = (a b c)/(ab + bc + ca),\n\nThen with a=200, b=240, c=300,\n\nDenominator: 200*240 +240*300 +300*200 =48000 +72000 +60000= 180,000,\n\nNumerator: 200\u00d7240\u00d7300=14,400,000,\n\n14,400,000 /180,000 =80,\n\nThus s=80.\n\nThis is an integer, so maybe this is the answer.\n\nBut where does this formula come from?\n\nIt might be derived from the relation in my previous calculation:\n\nThe three expressions for s:\n\nPQ =7s/6 =200,\n\nQR=7s/4=300,\n\nPR=7s/5=240,\n\nWhich gives s=1200/7 \u2248171.428,\n\nBut that contradicts this new idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is from a different configuration.\n\nAlternatively, my first approach was correct and the answer is 1200/7, but the problem might accept fractional answer. However, given the problem is likely from a competition expecting integer, 80 might be the expected answer.\n\nWait let me think differently.\n\nSuppose the hexagon's sides are each parallel to a side of the triangle and equally distant from the sides.\n\nThe distance between each pair of opposite sides is the same.\n\nLet me denote d as the distance between each pair of sides,\n\nThen the length of the hexagon's side can be expressed via trigonometric functions of the triangle's angles.\n\nThe side length s = d/(sin \u03b1),\n\nWhere \u03b1 is the angle between the two other sides.\n\nWait, in a triangle, the distance between two parallel sides would relate to the height.\n\nFor example, the distance between the side PQ and the opposite side of the hexagon parallel to PQ is d1,\n\nThen the length of the hexagon's side parallel to PQ is s = (height of the triangle - d1)/height * PQ length,\n\nWait, for a given triangle with base a and height h_a,\n\na line parallel to the base at distance d from the base would have length a*(1 - d/h_a).\n\nSimilarly for other sides.\n\nThus, the hexagon's side s must satisfy:\n\ns = a*(1 - d1/h_a) = b*(1 - d2/h_b) = c*(1 - d3/h_c),\n\nWhere d1, d2, d3 are distances from the respective bases to the hexagon's sides,\n\nAnd these distances are related through the geometry of the hexagon.\n\nHowever, due to the hexagon being equilateral, the distances must be related via the angles.\n\nLet me denote the heights of the triangle:\n\nHeight from P to QR: h_p,\n\nHeight from Q to RP: h_q,\n\nHeight from R to PQ: h_r.\n\nThe heights can be computed as area divided by base.\n\nArea of triangle PQR: using Heron's formula earlier was A =100*sqrt(37\u00d717\u00d713\u00d77),\n\nAlternatively, using base PQ=200 and height y_R= sqrt(57239),\n\nThus area A = (200 * sqrt(57239))/2 =100*sqrt(57239).\n\nThus,\n\nh_p = 2A / QR = 2*(100\u221a57239)/240 = (200\u221a57239)/240 = (5\u221a57239)/6,\n\nSimilarly,\n\nh_q=2A / RP=2*(100\u221a57239)/300= (200\u221a57239)/300= (2\u221a57239)/3,\n\nh_r=2A / PQ=2*(100\u221a57239)/200= sqrt(57239).\n\nNow, the distances d1 (from PQ to hexagon's side parallel to PQ),\n\nd2 (from QR to hexagon's side parallel to QR),\n\nd3 (from RP to hexagon's side parallel to RP),\n\nmust satisfy:\n\ns = PQ*(1 - d1/h_r) =200*(1 - d1/sqrt(57239)),\n\ns = QR*(1 - d2/h_p)=240*(1 - d2/(5\u221a57239/6)),\n\ns = RP*(1 - d3/h_q)=300*(1 - d3/(2\u221a57239/3)),\n\nAlso, the distances d1, d2, d3 are related via the geometry of the hexagon.\n\nHowever, this is getting too complex without more constraints.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, the distances must be such that the three expressions for s are equal.\n\nSetting the first two expressions equal:\n\n200*(1 - d1/h_r) =240*(1 - d2/h_p),\n\nAnd similarly others,\n\nBut without knowing the relation between d1, d2, d3, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, assume that the distances are proportional to the heights.\n\nLet me assume that the distances d1 =k*h_r,\n\nd2 =k*h_p,\n\nd3 =k*h_q,\n\nFor some k between0 and1,\n\nThen,\n\ns =200*(1 -k),\n\ns=240*(1 -k*(h_p/h_p)? Wait,\n\nWait substituting,\n\nFirst equation:\n\n200*(1 -k) =240*(1 -k*(h_p/h_p))?,\n\nWait this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral, the ratios of the distances must satisfy certain conditions based on the triangle's angles.\n\nThis is getting too involved, and given that my first derivation led to s=1200/7\u2248171.428, which is 1200 divided by7, but the problem might have an elegant answer of 80.\n\nWait let me see:\n\nIf s=80,\n\nThen in my first approach, the triangle sides would be 7s/6= 7*80/6\u224893.33,\n\nWhich is not 200, so no.\n\nAlternatively, if s= 1200/7,\n\nThe triangle sides are 200, 300,240,\n\nWhich matches the problem's given sides if ordered appropriately.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 1200/7, which is approximately 171.428..., but as a fraction.\n\nBut the problem might require an exact value, so boxed as \\boxed{\\dfrac{1200}{7}}.\n\nHowever, since the problem mentions \"the side length of the hexagon\" and it's common in competition problems to have integer answers, perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait let me check my vector-based calculation again.\n\nWe derived that s=1200/7\u2248171.42857,\n\nBut the problem's triangle sides are 200,240,300,\n\nWait the hexagon's side s=1200/7,\n\nThen the three computed triangle sides are 200,300,240,\n\nWhich are exactly the given triangle sides (just reordered),\n\nTherefore, this is correct,\n\nThus, the answer is 1200/7,\n\nBut since the problem might want it as a fraction,\n\nBut let me see if 1200 divided by7 can be simplified? No, 7 is prime.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects an integer answer and I made a mistake in the vector signs.\n\nWait in the vector approach, the triangle's side lengths are PQ=7s/6, QR=7s/4, PR=7s/5,\n\nIf the problem's triangle sides are 200,240,300, then:\n\nAssuming PQ=200, QR=240, PR=300,\n\nThen,\n\n7s/6=200,\n\n7s/4=240,\n\n7s/5=300,\n\nWhich would require:\n\ns=200\u00d76/7\u2248171.428,\n\ns=240\u00d74/7\u2248137.14,\n\ns=300\u00d75/7\u2248214.28,\n\nContradiction,\n\nBut if the triangle sides are arranged as PQ=300, QR=240, PR=200,\n\nThen,\n\n7s/6=300 \u21d2 s= 257.14,\n\n7s/4=240 \u21d2 s= 240\u00d74/7\u2248137.14,\n\nAgain contradiction,\n\nThus the only assignment that works is PQ=200, QR=300, PR=240,\n\nWhich gives s=1200/7,\n\nSo the answer is 1200/7,\n\nBut since the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", perhaps as a fraction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption of the vectors' directions was incorrect leading to a swapped ratio.\n\nWait perhaps the scaling factors are inverted.\n\nIf instead of k = s/240,\n\nIt's k =240/s,\n\nWait let me think differently.\n\nLet me denote the scaling factor as t such that the hexagon's side s = t * triangle's side,\n\nBut in that case, the triangle's side would be s/t,\n\nWhich may not help.\n\nAlternatively, the key relation is the three side lengths of the triangle in terms of s:\n\nPQ =7s/6,\n\nQR =7s/4,\n\nPR=7s/5,\n\nThese must be the three given sides 200,240,300 in some order.\n\nSo to have all three equations satisfied:\n\n7s/6,\n\n7s/4,\n\n7s/5,\n\nare exactly the given lengths.\n\nTherefore, the three expressions must each equal one of 200,240,300.\n\nThus:\n\n7s/6=200,\n\n7s/4=240,\n\n7s/5=300,\n\nWhich gives s=1200/7\u2248171.43,\n\nThus this is the only solution.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be 1200/7,\n\nWhich is approximately 171.428, but as a reduced fraction it is 1200/7,\n\nSo boxed as \\boxed{\\dfrac{1200}{7}}.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects integer, so I might have made a mistake, but I can't find where.\n\nWait let me think of another approach.\n\nAssume that the triangle PQR has sides 200,240,300,\n\nThe hexagon has sides of length s,\n\nThe ratio of the hexagon's side to the triangle's side it's parallel to is the same for all three.\n\nLet the ratio be k,\n\nThus,\n\ns = k\u00d7200,\n\ns =k\u00d7240,\n\ns=k\u00d7300,\n\nWhich is impossible unless s=0.\n\nThus, not.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio is different for each,\n\nLet s =k\u00d7200 = m\u00d7240 =n\u00d7300,\n\nWith k,m,n related.\n\nFrom the hexagon being equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel,\n\nThe lines must be offset such that the distances between the sides proportional to the triangle's height.\n\nThe distance between the side of the triangle and the hexagon's parallel side is proportional to (1 -

x*QR - z*QR = QR*(1 -x -z),\n\nWait this is getting too tangled.\n\nAlternatively, the three corner triangles' similarity ratios must satisfy:\n\nx + y = a,\n\ny + z = b,\n\nz +x =c,\n\nBut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in a hexagon with opposite sides parallel in a triangle,\n\nThe three ratios must satisfy:\n\nx + y + z =1,\n\nBut I need to find a relation.\n\nAlternatively, using barycentric coordinates,\n\nThe hexagon's vertices are at (x, y, z) where x + y + z =1,\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, the key equation comes from the three expressions for s:\n\n200(1 -x) =240(1 -

This is similar to the inner Soddy circle or something similar, but with lines.\n\nThe formula s = (a*b*c)/(ab + bc + ca) might be derived from the relation in such a configuration.\n\nLet me assume that this formula is correct, then the answer is 80.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider homothety.\n\nThe hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down, but since it's equilateral, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the lines forming the hexagon divide the triangle's sides in ratios such that the product of the ratios equals 1.\n\nSuppose each side of the triangle is divided into segments with ratio t:(1-t),\n\nThen the side of the hexagon is t*(1-t)*side,\n\nBut equating for all sides,\n\nBut this is guesswork.\n\nAlternatively, if the hexagon is the inner Napoleon hexagon or something, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that the formula gives an integer answer and my vector approach gives a fractional answer,\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is 80,\n\nHence, I will go with \\boxed{80}.\n\n\nWait, but given that in my vector approach, the computed side length s=1200/7\u2248171.42857,\n\nBut the problem states the triangle has sides 200,240,300,\n\nThus if the hexagon's side is 80,\n\nThen the triangle sides would be 7*80/6=93.33, which is not matching,\n\nTherefore, the vector approach must be correct,\n\nThus the answer must be 1200/7.\n\nPerhaps the problem allows fractional answers,\n\nTherefore, I will stick with \\boxed{\\dfrac{1200}{7}}.\n\nBut I'm now confused as the problem might have a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps using area ratios.\n\nThe area of the triangle is 100\u221a57239,\n\nThe area of the hexagon would be the area of the triangle minus the three smaller triangles,\n\nThe three smaller triangles are similar to the main triangle with scaling factors x,y,z,\n\nThus their areas are x\u00b2*A, y\u00b2*A, z\u00b2*A,\n\nThe hexagon's area is A - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)*A,\n\nBut equilateral hexagon area is also (3\u221a3/2)s\u00b2,\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, since all three smaller triangles' similarity ratios must satisfy certain conditions,\n\nLet me suppose that the scaling ratios for the three corners are all equal,\n\nLet the scaling factor be k,\n\nThen each smaller triangle has area k\u00b2*A,\n\nThe hexagon's area is A -3k\u00b2*A,\n\nBut the hexagon being equilateral might not relate directly.\n\nAlternatively, the side of the hexagon is s = (200 -200k),\n\nSimilarly for other sides,\n\nSetting 200(1 -k)=240(1 -k)=300(1 -k),\n\nWhich requires all to be equal,\n\nThus k=(200 -s)/200,\n\n(240 -s)/240,\n\n(300 -s)/300,\n\nThus,\n\n(200 -s)/200 = (240 -s)/240,\n\nCross multiplying,\n\n240(200 -s) =200(240 -s),\n\n48000 -240s =48000 -200s,\n\n-240s +200s=0 \u21d2-40s=0 \u21d2s=0,\n\nContradiction.\n\nThus different scaling factors are needed,\n\nTherefore, my initial vector approach is the only consistent way,\n\nThus the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1200}{7}}.\n\nHowever, since the problem might expect an integer, maybe the correct answer is 80, but I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll go with the vector approach's result.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1200}{7}}\n\n\nGiven a convex equilateral hexagon with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, and the triangle formed by extending the segments AB, CD, and EF having side lengths 200, 240, and 300, we need to find the side length of the hexagon.\n\n1. **Setting Up the Problem**:\n   - The hexagon is equilateral with all sides equal to \\( s \\).\n   - The triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, and 300.\n   - The hexagon's sides are parallel to the sides of this triangle.\n\n2. **Vector Analysis**:\n   - The hexagon's sides are vectors proportional to the triangle's sides.\n   - Using vector analysis and coordinate geometry, the side lengths of the triangle formed by the extensions are derived in terms of \\( s \\).\n   - The triangle's sides are found to be \\( \\frac{7s}{6} \\), \\( \\frac{7s}{4} \\), and \\( \\frac{7s}{5} \\).\n\n3. **Matching Side Lengths**:\n   - The given triangle sides (200, 240, 300) must match the derived expressions.\n   - Assigning the sides appropriately:\n     - \\( \\frac{7s}{6} = 200 \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{7s}{4} = 300 \\)\n     - \\( \\frac{7s}{5} = 240 \\)\n   - Solving for \\( s \\) from each equation confirms consistency:\n     - \\( s = \\frac{1200}{7} \\approx 171.428 \\)\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The derived side length \\( \\frac{1200}{7} \\) satisfies all conditions and matches the triangle's side lengths when properly assigned.\n\nThus, the side length of the hexagon is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{1200}{7}}\n\\]",
