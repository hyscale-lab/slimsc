      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and another equation involving their squares multiplied by each other. The equation given is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the problem is about counting the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b, c) to the two equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n2. a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nI need to find all triples (a, b, c) that satisfy both equations. Let me first see if I can manipulate the second equation to make it more manageable.\n\nLooking at the second equation, it's the sum of terms like a\u00b2b and similar permutations. Let me see if there's a way to factor this or relate it to the first equation. Maybe using some algebraic identities?\n\nWait, the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b can be rewritten as ab(a + b) + ac(a + c) + bc(b + c). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps factoring further? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, notice that this expression is symmetric in a, b, and c. So maybe there's some symmetry in the solutions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express this in terms of the variables (a + b + c), (ab + bc + ca), and (abc). Since the first equation gives us a + b + c = 300, maybe we can express the second equation in terms of these symmetric sums.\n\nLet me recall some algebraic identities. There's an identity that relates the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b to the symmetric sums. Let me try to recall or derive it.\n\nFirst, note that (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b + 3abc. Wait, that's interesting!\n\nSo, expanding (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n= a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\nWait, actually, maybe more systematically:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: a*ab = a\u00b2b\n\nSecond term: a*bc = abc\n\nThird term: a*ca = a\u00b2c\n\nFourth term: b*ab = ab\u00b2\n\nFifth term: b*bc = b\u00b2c\n\nSixth term: b*ca = abc\n\nSeventh term: c*ab = abc\n\nEighth term: c*bc = bc\u00b2\n\nNinth term: c*ca = c\u00b2a\n\nSo adding them all up:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + bc\u00b2 + 3abc (since abc appears three times)\n\nSo indeed:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 3abc\n\nTherefore, rearranged,\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc\n\nAh! So the left-hand side of the given equation is equal to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. That's a crucial step.\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 300, so substituting that into the equation:\n\nThe second equation becomes:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can simplify this equation. Let me divide both sides by 3 to make the numbers smaller:\n\n100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSo now, the equation is:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm, that might be a bit more manageable, but still not straightforward. Let me see if I can find some substitution or another way to approach this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider variables in terms of two variables since a + b + c = 300. Let me denote variables as a, b, and c, but since they sum to 300, perhaps express one variable in terms of the others. Let me say c = 300 - a - b. Then substitute c into the equation.\n\nLet me try that approach.\n\nLet c = 300 - a - b. Then substitute into the equation:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nFirst, compute each term:\n\nabc = a*b*(300 - a - b)\n\nab + bc + ca = ab + b*(300 - a - b) + a*(300 - a - b)\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, compute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab + bc + ca = ab + b(300 - a - b) + a(300 - a - b)\n\nLet me expand each term:\n\n= ab + 300b - ab - b\u00b2 + 300a - a\u00b2 - ab\n\nWait, let me do that step by step:\n\nFirst term is ab.\n\nSecond term: b*(300 - a - b) = 300b - ab - b\u00b2\n\nThird term: a*(300 - a - b) = 300a - a\u00b2 - ab\n\nAdding all together:\n\nab + (300b - ab - b\u00b2) + (300a - a\u00b2 - ab)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nab - ab - ab = -ab\n\nThen, 300b + 300a\n\nThen, -b\u00b2 -a\u00b2\n\nSo altogether:\n\n300a + 300b - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - ab\n\nTherefore, ab + bc + ca = 300(a + b) - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - ab\n\nHmm. Not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me also compute abc:\n\nabc = a*b*(300 - a - b) = 300ab - a\u00b2b - ab\u00b2\n\nNow, plugging into the equation:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nSubstitute the expressions:\n\n[300ab - a\u00b2b - ab\u00b2] - 100[300(a + b) - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - ab] + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nLet me expand each part.\n\nFirst term: 300ab - a\u00b2b - ab\u00b2\n\nSecond term: -100*[300(a + b) - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 - ab] = -100*300(a + b) + 100a\u00b2 + 100b\u00b2 + 100ab\n\nThird term: +2,000,000\n\nSo putting all together:\n\n[300ab - a\u00b2b - ab\u00b2] + [-30,000(a + b) + 100a\u00b2 + 100b\u00b2 + 100ab] + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nNow, combine like terms term by term.\n\nFirst, let's handle the terms with a\u00b2b and ab\u00b2. There's -a\u00b2b and -ab\u00b2 in the first bracket.\n\nThe rest:\n\nLooking at the other terms:\n\nFrom first bracket:\n\n300ab\n\nFrom the second bracket:\n\n-30,000a -30,000b\n\n+100a\u00b2 +100b\u00b2 +100ab\n\nAlso, the third term is +2,000,000.\n\nSo combining all:\n\nLet's collect all terms:\n\nTerms with a\u00b2:\n\n+100a\u00b2 - a\u00b2b ?\n\nWait, actually, the term -a\u00b2b is from the first bracket, but that's a cubic term. Similarly, -ab\u00b2 is also a cubic term. Hmm, but this might complicate things. Let me see if we can rearrange the equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is getting too messy. Maybe there's a smarter approach here. Let me think again.\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 300, and the second equation is in terms of ab + bc + ca and abc. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca. Then the second equation is:\n\n300*Q - 3*P = 6,000,000.\n\nSo, rearranged:\n\n300Q - 3P = 6,000,000 \u21d2 100Q - P = 2,000,000 \u21d2 P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nTherefore, P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nSo if we can express Q in terms of S and perhaps another symmetric sum, but since S is fixed at 300, maybe we can relate Q and P through other means.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for three variables, the relation between S, Q, and P is given by the standard symmetric sums.\n\nWait, actually, the standard symmetric sums are S = a + b + c,\n\nQ = ab + bc + ca,\n\nand R = abc = P.\n\nSo, for three variables, the cubic equation with roots a, b, c is x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Qx - R = 0.\n\nBut I don't know if that helps here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find some relation between Q and P given that P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the inequality between Q and S. For non-negative integers a, b, c, the maximum value of Q given S is when two variables are as large as possible and the third is zero? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try to consider possible cases where variables are equal or two variables are equal, since the problem might have symmetric solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose that two variables are equal. Let's say a = b. Then maybe we can find solutions where variables are equal or in some proportion.\n\nSuppose a = b = c. Then since a + b + c = 300, each would be 100. Let's check if that satisfies the second equation.\n\nCompute the left-hand side (LHS):\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nIf all are 100, then each term is 100\u00b2*100 = 1,000,000, and there are 6 terms, so total is 6,000,000. Wait, that's exactly the value given! So (100, 100, 100) is a solution.\n\nHmm, so that's one solution. But the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers,\" so perhaps there are more solutions where variables are not all equal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other triples where two variables are equal and the third is different, or where one variable is zero.\n\nLet me test another case. Suppose one of the variables is zero, say c = 0. Then the equations become:\n\na + b = 300,\n\nand the second equation becomes a\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0 + 0 = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab*300.\n\nSo the second equation becomes 300ab = 6,000,000 \u21d2 ab = 20,000.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of nonnegative integer solutions (a, b) such that a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.\n\nSo, solving for a and b where a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation: Let a = x, then b = 300 - x,\n\nso x(300 - x) = 20,000 \u21d2 300x - x\u00b2 = 20,000 \u21d2 x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0.\n\nLet me compute discriminant D = 300\u00b2 - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.\n\nsqrt(10,000) = 100. So solutions are x = [300 \u00b1 100]/2 = (400/2)=200 or (200/2)=100.\n\nSo x = 200 or 100. Therefore, solutions (a, b) = (200, 100) or (100, 200). Therefore, when c = 0, we have two solutions: (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). However, since variables are nonnegative integers and we can permute them, but since we fixed c=0, those are separate. But when considering all permutations, there are more solutions. Wait, but if we set c=0, then permutations where another variable is zero would be different cases. Let me see.\n\nWait, actually, if we set c=0, then the triples where c=0 are (a, b, 0) with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. As above, there are two solutions here. Similarly, if we set a=0 or b=0, we get similar equations.\n\nSo for each variable being zero, there are two solutions, so total for cases where one variable is zero would be 3 variables * 2 solutions each = 6 solutions. But wait, hold on, actually when we set c=0, we get two solutions (200,100,0) and (100,200,0). Similarly, setting a=0 gives two solutions where (0, 200, 100) and (0, 100, 200), and setting b=0 gives (200,0,100) and (100,0,200). So indeed, 3 variables * 2 solutions each = 6 solutions where one variable is zero.\n\nAdditionally, the case where all variables are equal (100,100,100) is another solution. So that's 7 solutions so far. But maybe there are more solutions where none of the variables are zero and not all equal? Let's check that.\n\nSuppose that all variables are positive, so a, b, c \u2265 1. Let's see if there are other triples.\n\nSuppose that two variables are equal, but not all three. Let me say a = b \u2260 c. Let me set a = b = x, then c = 300 - 2x.\n\nThen plugging into the second equation:\n\nFirst, compute Q = ab + bc + ca = x\u00b2 + x(300 - 2x) + x(300 - 2x) = x\u00b2 + 2x(300 - 2x) = x\u00b2 + 600x - 4x\u00b2 = -3x\u00b2 + 600x.\n\nThen P = abc = x*x*(300 - 2x) = x\u00b2(300 - 2x).\n\nFrom earlier, we had the equation P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nSubstituting:\n\nx\u00b2(300 - 2x) = 100*(-3x\u00b2 + 600x) - 2,000,000.\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side (RHS):\n\n100*(-3x\u00b2 + 600x) - 2,000,000 = -300x\u00b2 + 60,000x - 2,000,000.\n\nSo set equation:\n\nx\u00b2(300 - 2x) = -300x\u00b2 + 60,000x - 2,000,000.\n\nExpand the left-hand side (LHS):\n\n300x\u00b2 - 2x\u00b3.\n\nSo equation becomes:\n\n300x\u00b2 - 2x\u00b3 = -300x\u00b2 + 60,000x - 2,000,000.\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\n300x\u00b2 - 2x\u00b3 + 300x\u00b2 - 60,000x + 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n(300x\u00b2 + 300x\u00b2) = 600x\u00b2,\n\n-2x\u00b3,\n\n-60,000x,\n\n+2,000,000.\n\nThus:\n\n-2x\u00b3 + 600x\u00b2 - 60,000x + 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n2x\u00b3 - 600x\u00b2 + 60,000x - 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm, need to solve this cubic equation. Let me see if x=100 is a solution:\n\nPlug x=100: 100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0. So yes, x=100 is a root.\n\nTherefore, (x - 100) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDivide the cubic by (x - 100):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nRoot at x=100:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by 100: 1*100 = 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.\n\nMultiply by 100: -200*100 = -20,000. Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000.\n\nMultiply by 100: 10,000 * 100 = 1,000,000. Add to last coefficient: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (x - 100)(x\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000).\n\nNow set the quadratic factor equal to zero:\n\nx\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000 = 0.\n\nCompute discriminant D = (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0.\n\nTherefore, x = [200 \u00b1 0]/2 = 100.\n\nThus, the quadratic has a double root at x=100. So the cubic factors as (x - 100)^3 = 0. Wait, but hold on:\n\nWait, the quadratic is x\u00b2 - 200x + 10,000, discriminant zero, so it's (x - 100)^2, so overall, the cubic is (x - 100)^3. Wait, let me check:\n\n(x - 100)^3 = x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + 30,000x - 1,000,000. Exactly. So yes, the equation is (x - 100)^3 = 0, so the only real solution is x=100.\n\nTherefore, in the case when a = b, the only solution is x = 100, so a = b = 100, c = 300 - 200 = 100. Which brings us back to the all-equal case (100, 100, 100). So that case doesn't give any new solutions beyond the all-equal one.\n\nHmm, so maybe the only solutions when two variables are equal is the all-equal case. Let me check another case where variables are different but not all equal.\n\nSuppose that one variable is double another, or some proportion. Alternatively, perhaps variables are in an arithmetic progression?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where two variables are equal but the third is different? Wait, but in the above, when we set two variables equal, we only ended up with the all-equal case. So maybe no solutions with two variables equal except when all are equal?\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose that one variable is much larger than the others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to look for solutions where variables are (200,100,0) permutations, which we already have. But perhaps there are other triples where none are zero?\n\nLet me think of another approach. Let me recall that the equation is:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 = 0.\n\nWe can rearrange this as:\n\nabc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, perhaps factor this equation?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of ratios. Let me suppose that all variables are multiples of some common factor. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that a, b, c have a common divisor d. Let me set a = d\u00b7x, b = d\u00b7y, c = d\u00b7z, where x, y, z are integers with gcd(x,y,z)=1.\n\nThen, substituting into the first equation:\n\nd(x + y + z) = 300 \u21d2 d divides 300. Similarly, the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + ... etc. Let me see if this substitution helps, but maybe it complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps set variables such that they are scaled.\n\nAlternatively, note that in the case where all variables are 100, we have abc = 1,000,000. Let me see what the left side of the equation is:\n\nabc = 1,000,000,\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) = 100*(100*100 + 100*100 + 100*100) = 100*(30,000) = 3,000,000,\n\nso 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 2,000,000, which matches the RHS. So that works.\n\nNow, let's suppose that there's another solution where variables are not all equal and none are zero. Let me suppose that a, b, c are all different and positive integers.\n\nLet me try some numbers. Maybe pick a = 150, b = 100, c = 50. Then check the equations.\n\nFirst, a + b + c = 150 + 100 + 50 = 300, that's good.\n\nSecond equation: compute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nCompute term by term:\n\na\u00b2b = 150\u00b2*100 = 22500*100 = 2,250,000\n\na\u00b2c = 150\u00b2*50 = 22500*50 = 1,125,000\n\nb\u00b2a = 100\u00b2*150 = 10,000*150 = 1,500,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 100\u00b2*50 = 10,000*50 = 500,000\n\nc\u00b2a = 50\u00b2*150 = 2,500*150 = 375,000\n\nc\u00b2b = 50\u00b2*100 = 2,500*100 = 250,000\n\nAdding all together:\n\n2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 \u2192 4,875,000\n\n+500,000 \u2192 5,375,000\n\n+375,000 \u2192 5,750,000\n\n+250,000 \u2192 6,000,000. Wait a second! That's exactly the required value. So (150, 100, 50) is a solution?\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check the math again because that seems surprising.\n\nWait a second, let me recalculate each term step by step to be precise.\n\nCompute a\u00b2b where a=150, b=100: (150)^2 = 22500; 22500 * 100 = 2,250,000. Correct.\n\na\u00b2c = 22500 * 50 = 1,125,000. Correct.\n\nb\u00b2a where b=100, a=150: (100)^2 * 150 = 10,000 * 150 = 1,500,000. Correct.\n\nb\u00b2c = 10,000 *50 = 500,000. Correct.\n\nc\u00b2a where c=50, a=150: (50)^2 =2500; 2500 *150 = 375,000. Correct.\n\nc\u00b2b =2500 *100 =250,000. Correct.\n\nNow sum all terms:\n\n2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\nAdding 1,500,000: 3,375,000 + 1,500,000 = 4,875,000\n\nAdding 500,000: 5,375,000\n\nAdding 375,000: 5,750,000\n\nAdding 250,000: 6,000,000. Yes! That works. So (150,100,50) is another solution. Hmm, so there are solutions where variables are not all equal and none are zero. That complicates things.\n\nSo, my previous assumption that only the all-equal case and the cases with a zero work is incorrect. Therefore, there are more solutions. Need to find them all.\n\nHmm. So perhaps I need a more systematic approach. Let's note that in this example, (150, 100, 50), the variables are in an arithmetic progression? 50, 100, 150. So 50 difference each. Hmm, but not sure if that's a general pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the variables are in a ratio. Let me see. 150:100:50 simplifies to 3:2:1. So maybe ratios are important here.\n\nLet me suppose that the variables are in the ratio k: m: n, where k, m, n are integers. Let me set a = kx, b = mx, c = nx, such that k + m + n = 300 / x. Wait, but perhaps better to set variables as multiples. Let me suppose that a = 3t, b = 2t, c = t. Then a + b + c = 6t. To get 300, set 6t = 300 \u21d2 t = 50. Then a=150, b=100, c=50, which is exactly the solution I found earlier. So that works.\n\nTherefore, if variables are in ratio 3:2:1, then 3t + 2t + t =6t=300 \u21d2 t=50, so that gives the solution. Similarly, permutations of this ratio would also work. Let me check if that holds.\n\nSuppose variables are in the ratio 1:2:3. Let me see if that works. Let\u2019s let a = t, b = 2t, c = 3t. Then a + b + c = 6t = 300 \u21d2 t =50. So a=50, b=100, c=150. That's the same as the previous solution but ordered differently. So permutations of (150,100,50) will also be solutions. So each permutation of (50,100,150) is a solution. How many permutations are there?\n\nSince all three numbers are distinct, the number of permutations is 3! = 6. So that gives 6 more solutions. Adding to the previous ones:\n\nAll-equal case: 1 solution,\n\nCases with a zero: 6 solutions,\n\nRatio 3:2:1 permutations: 6 solutions,\n\nWait, but hold on: let me check whether (50, 100, 150) actually satisfies the second equation. Wait, I did check (150,100,50) and it worked, but let me confirm another permutation like (50, 150, 100):\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me assign a=50, b=150, c=100.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = 50\u00b2*150 = 2500*150 = 375,000\n\na\u00b2c = 2500*100 = 250,000\n\nb\u00b2a = (150)^2*50 = 22500*50 = 1,125,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 22500*100 = 2,250,000\n\nc\u00b2a = 100\u00b2*50 = 10,000*50 = 500,000\n\nc\u00b2b = 10,000*150 = 1,500,000\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n375,000 + 250,000 = 625,000\n\n+1,125,000 \u2192 1,750,000\n\n+2,250,000 \u2192 4,000,000\n\n+500,000 \u2192 4,500,000\n\n+1,500,000 \u2192 6,000,000. Yep, works again. So all permutations of (50,100,150) are valid.\n\nSo that's 6 solutions. So far total solutions: 1 + 6 + 6 = 13? Wait, but wait, let's recount:\n\nWait, all-equal: 1,\n\nZero cases: 6,\n\n3:2:1 ratio permutations: 6,\n\nTotal so far: 1 +6 +6=13. But maybe there are more?\n\nWait, let me see if there are other ratios. Let me try another ratio. Suppose variables are in the ratio 2:1:1. Let me see.\n\nLet variables a = 2t, b = t, c = t, then a + b + c =4t = 300 \u21d2 t=75. So a=150, b=75, c=75. Let me check if that works.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nPlugging in a=150, b=75, c=75:\n\na\u00b2b = 150\u00b2*75 = 22500*75 = 1,687,500\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b = 1,687,500\n\nb\u00b2a = 75\u00b2*150 = 5625*150 = 843,750\n\nb\u00b2c = same as b\u00b2a = 843,750\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a = 843,750\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c = 843,750\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1,687,500 + 1,687,500 = 3,375,000\n\n+843,750 + 843,750 = 3,375,000 + 1,687,500 = 5,062,500\n\n+843,750 +843,750 = 5,062,500 + 1,687,500 = 6,750,000.\n\nWhich is more than 6,000,000. So that doesn't work. So that ratio is invalid.\n\nHmm, so that ratio doesn't work. Maybe another ratio?\n\nLet me try ratio 4:1:1. Let me see. a + b + c = 6t = 300 \u21d2 t=50. So a=200, b=50, c=50. Then check.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b: 200\u00b2*50 = 40,000*50 = 2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as above = 2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a = 50\u00b2*200 = 2500*200=500,000\n\nb\u00b2c = same as above =500,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a =500,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c=500,000\n\nTotal sum:\n\n2,000,000 +2,000,000 =4,000,000\n\n+500,000 +500,000 =5,000,000\n\n+500,000 +500,000 =6,000,000. Wait! That works! So (200,50,50) is also a solution. Wait, so that is a solution?\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, a=200, b=50, c=50.\n\nCompute each term step by step:\n\na\u00b2b: 200\u00b2*50 = 40,000 *50 =2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c: same as above =2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a: 50\u00b2*200 =2500*200=500,000\n\nb\u00b2c: 50\u00b2*50 =2500*50=125,000? Wait, hold on, b\u00b2c where b=50, c=50: 50\u00b2*50 =2500*50=125,000? Wait, I think I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait, variables: a=200, b=50, c=50.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = (200)^2 * 50 = 40,000 *50 =2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c = 40,000 *50 =2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a = (50)^2 *200 =2500 *200 =500,000\n\nb\u00b2c = (50)^2 *50 =2500 *50 =125,000\n\nc\u00b2a = (50)^2 *200 =2500 *200 =500,000\n\nc\u00b2b = (50)^2 *50 =2500 *50 =125,000\n\nNow adding all together:\n\n2,000,000 + 2,000,000 =4,000,000\n\n+500,000 +125,000 =525,000 \u2192 total 4,525,000\n\n+500,000 \u2192 5,025,000\n\n+125,000 \u2192 5,150,000. Wait, that's not 6 million. Wait, so my mistake was in the previous step where I thought b\u00b2c and c\u00b2b would be 500,000 each, but actually, since b and c are both 50, when calculating b\u00b2c it's 50^2*50, which is 125,000. So total sum would be:\n\nLet me add again:\n\nFirst two terms: 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 =4,000,000\n\nThen b\u00b2a: +500,000 \u2192 4,500,000\n\nb\u00b2c: +125,000 \u21924,625,000\n\nc\u00b2a: +500,000 \u21925,125,000\n\nc\u00b2b: +125,000 \u21925,250,000.\n\nHmm, that's only 5,250,000. So that's less than 6,000,000. So that combination does not work. So my initial miscalculation was wrong. Therefore, that ratio doesn't work. So my mistake earlier was in miscalculating terms when variables are equal. So the ratio 4:1:1 does not give a valid solution.\n\nHmm, so perhaps only certain ratios work. Let me try another ratio. Let's think of the previous solution (150,100,50) which was 3:2:1. Let me see if there's another ratio.\n\nSuppose variables are in the ratio 4:3:1. Let me set a=4t, b=3t, c=t. Then total is 8t = 300 \u21d2 t=37.5. Not integer, so that would not give integer values. Not good.\n\nAlternatively, ratio 5:3:2. Let me see:\n\nLet a=5t, b=3t, c=2t. Total is 10t=300 \u21d2 t=30. Thus a=150, b=90, c=60. Let me check this.\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b = (150)^2*90 =22,500 *90 =2,025,000\n\na\u00b2c =22,500 *60 =1,350,000\n\nb\u00b2a = (90)^2*150 =8,100*150=1,215,000\n\nb\u00b2c =8,100*60=486,000\n\nc\u00b2a = (60)^2*150 =3,600*150=540,000\n\nc\u00b2b =3,600*90=324,000\n\nTotal sum:\n\n2,025,000 +1,350,000 =3,375,000\n\n+1,215,000 \u21924,590,000\n\n+486,000 \u21925,076,000\n\n+540,000 \u21925,616,000\n\n+324,000 \u21925,940,000. Close but not 6,000,000. So that's 5,940,000. Not enough.\n\nHmm. Maybe another ratio? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the only solutions are the all-equal case, the cases with a zero, and the 3:2:1 ratio cases. Let me see if there are other ratios with integer t.\n\nSuppose ratio 2:1:1 but with different variables. Wait, tried that earlier and it didn't work. How about 6:3:1? Let me see:\n\na=6t, b=3t, c=t. Total:10t=300 \u21d2 t=30. So a=180, b=90, c=30. Let me check:\n\na\u00b2b =180\u00b2*90 =32,400*90=2,916,000\n\na\u00b2c=32,400*30=972,000\n\nb\u00b2a=90\u00b2*180=8,100*180=1,458,000\n\nb\u00b2c=8,100*30=243,000\n\nc\u00b2a=30\u00b2*180=900*180=162,000\n\nc\u00b2b=900*90=81,000\n\nSum:\n\n2,916,000 +972,000 =3,888,000\n\n+1,458,000 \u21925,346,000\n\n+243,000 \u21925,589,000\n\n+162,000 \u21925,751,000\n\n+81,000 \u21925,832,000. Not enough.\n\nHmm. Not 6,000,000. Not working.\n\nAlternatively, ratio 5:2:3. Let me see:\n\na=5t, b=2t, c=3t. Total:10t=300 \u21d2 t=30. So a=150, b=60, c=90. Check:\n\nThis is similar to the 5:3:2 case but different order. Let me compute:\n\na\u00b2b =150\u00b2*60 =22,500*60=1,350,000\n\na\u00b2c=22,500*90=2,025,000\n\nb\u00b2a=60\u00b2*150=3,600*150=540,000\n\nb\u00b2c=3,600*90=324,000\n\nc\u00b2a=90\u00b2*150=8,100*150=1,215,000\n\nc\u00b2b=8,100*60=486,000\n\nAdding up:\n\n1,350,000 +2,025,000 =3,375,000\n\n+540,000 \u21923,915,000\n\n+324,000 \u21924,239,000\n\n+1,215,000 \u21925,454,000\n\n+486,000 \u21925,940,000. Same as before. Not enough.\n\nHmm, so maybe the only non-trivial solutions (apart from all equal and zeros) are the 3:2:1 ratios. Let me see.\n\nWait, let me try another ratio. Let me suppose variables are in ratio 4:3:3. Let me see:\n\nLet a=4t, b=3t, c=3t. Total:10t=300 \u21d2 t=30. So a=120, b=90, c=90. Let me check:\n\nCompute terms:\n\na\u00b2b =120\u00b2*90 =14,400*90=1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c=14,400*90=1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a=90\u00b2*120=8,100*120=972,000\n\nb\u00b2c=8,100*90=729,000\n\nc\u00b2a= same as b\u00b2a=972,000\n\nc\u00b2b= same as b\u00b2c=729,000\n\nTotal sum:\n\n1,296,000 +1,296,000 =2,592,000\n\n+972,000 \u21923,564,000\n\n+729,000 \u21924,293,000\n\n+972,000 \u21925,265,000\n\n+729,000 \u21926,000,000. Wait, that works!\n\nWait, so (120,90,90) is a solution?\n\nLet me verify each term:\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\na\u00b2b = (120)^2 *90 = 14,400 *90 =1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as above =1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a = (90)^2 *120 =8,100*120 =972,000\n\nb\u00b2c = (90)^2 *90 =8,100*90 =729,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a =972,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c =729,000\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1,296,000 + 1,296,000 =2,592,000\n\n+972,000 \u21923,564,000\n\n+729,000 \u21924,293,000\n\n+972,000 \u21925,265,000\n\n+729,000 \u21926,000,000. Yes! So this works. So (120,90,90) is a solution. Therefore, another ratio: 4:3:3.\n\nSo permutations of this would also be solutions. Since in this case, two variables are equal (b and c here), so the number of distinct permutations would be 3 (since two are the same). For example:\n\n(120,90,90), (90,120,90), (90,90,120). So three permutations.\n\nThus, that adds three more solutions.\n\nHmm, so now this complicates things further. So there are more ratios. Let me see what ratio this is. 4:3:3 simplifies to 4:3:3, which can be written as 4:3:3. So in terms of ratios with two variables equal, perhaps?\n\nSo, variables can be in ratios where two are equal and the third is in a different proportion. Let's see:\n\nLet me suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b, and the third is different, c. Then we can set a = b = x, c = 300 - 2x. Then, as before, we can plug into the equation.\n\nWait, earlier when I set a = b, I ended up with only the all-equal case, but in this case, with (120,90,90), a and c are different from b? Wait, no, in the case of (120,90,90), two variables are equal (the 90s), so let's set variables as a= x, b = y, c = y. Then:\n\na + 2y = 300 \u21d2 a = 300 - 2y.\n\nThen plug into the equation:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) + 2,000,000 =0\n\nSo:\n\na*y\u00b2 - 100( a*y + y\u00b2 + a*y ) + 2,000,000 =0\n\nWait, compute each term:\n\nFirst, abc = a*y*y = a y\u00b2.\n\nab + bc + ca = a*y + y*y + a*y = 2 a y + y\u00b2.\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\na y\u00b2 - 100*(2 a y + y\u00b2) + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nSubstitute a = 300 - 2y:\n\n(300 - 2y)y\u00b2 - 100*(2*(300 - 2y)*y + y\u00b2) + 2,000,000 =0.\n\nLet me expand this step by step.\n\nFirst term: (300 - 2y)y\u00b2 = 300y\u00b2 - 2y\u00b3.\n\nSecond term: -100*(2*(300 - 2y)*y + y\u00b2)\n\nFirst compute inside the brackets:\n\n2*(300 - 2y)*y = 2*(300y - 2y\u00b2) = 600y -4y\u00b2\n\nAdding y\u00b2: total is 600y -4y\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =600y -3y\u00b2.\n\nMultiply by -100: -100*(600y -3y\u00b2) = -60,000y + 300y\u00b2.\n\nThird term: +2,000,000.\n\nPutting all together:\n\nFirst term + second term + third term:\n\n[300y\u00b2 - 2y\u00b3] + [ -60,000y + 300y\u00b2 ] + 2,000,000 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n300y\u00b2 + 300y\u00b2 =600y\u00b2,\n\n-2y\u00b3,\n\n-60,000y,\n\n+2,000,000.\n\nThus:\n\n-2y\u00b3 +600y\u00b2 -60,000y +2,000,000 =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n2y\u00b3 -600y\u00b2 +60,000y -2,000,000 =0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\ny\u00b3 -300y\u00b2 +30,000y -1,000,000 =0.\n\nHmm, this is the same cubic equation as before when we set a = b = x! Which had root y =100, but in this case, the variables are different. Wait, let me check if y=100 is a solution here:\n\nPlug y=100:\n\n100\u00b3 -300*100\u00b2 +30,000*100 -1,000,000\n\n=1,000,000 -300*10,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000\n\n=1,000,000 -3,000,000 +3,000,000 -1,000,000 =0. So yes.\n\nThen factor (y -100):\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nCoefficients:1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nRoot at y=100:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by100: 100. Add to -300: -200.\n\nMultiply by100: -200*100 = -20,000. Add to 30,000:10,000.\n\nMultiply by100:10,000*100=1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000:0.\n\nThus, factors to (y -100)(y\u00b2 -200y +10,000).\n\nSet quadratic to zero:\n\ny\u00b2 -200y +10,000 =0.\n\nDiscriminant D=40,000 -40,000=0 \u21d2 y= (200)/2=100. So double root at y=100.\n\nThus, the cubic factors as (y-100)^3=0 \u21d2 y=100 only.\n\nTherefore, the only solution is y=100, leading to a=300-2y=300-200=100. So that gives (100,100,100), the all-equal case. But earlier, we found (120,90,90) which is a solution where two variables are equal. How come?\n\nAh, perhaps because in this case, when two variables are equal, but the third is different, but in the equation setup, I assumed two variables are equal (b=c=y), but the solution (120,90,90) has two variables equal but the third different, but the cubic equation only gives y=100, leading to a=100. Therefore, the solution (120,90,90) must belong to a different case where variables are not set as a, y, y, but maybe a different pairing?\n\nWait a second, in (120,90,90), the two equal variables are b and c. So when I set variables as a, b, c with b = c = y, then a = 300 - 2y. The solution (120,90,90) would mean a=120, so 300 -2y =120 \u21d2 2y=180 \u21d2 y=90. So y=90. But according to the equation above, when we set up for variables b=c=y, the equation only gives y=100 as a solution. But here y=90 is a solution?\n\nWait, so there must be an error in my algebra here. Because when I set up the equation with variables b=c=y, I ended up with an equation that only allows y=100, but in reality, there is a solution at y=90. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait let me re-calculate the equation for the case when two variables are equal (b = c = y), so a = 300 - 2y.\n\nThen we have to plug into the main equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nLet me recompute this step by step with a = 300-2y, b = y, c = y.\n\nabc = (300 - 2y)*y*y = (300y - 2y\u00b2)y = 300y\u00b2 - 2y\u00b3.\n\nab + bc + ca = (300-2y)*y + y*y + (300-2y)*y = [ (300y - 2y\u00b2) + y\u00b2 + (300y - 2y\u00b2) ] = 300y -2y\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +300y -2y\u00b2 = 600y -3y\u00b2.\n\nThus the equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 = (300y\u00b2 -2y\u00b3) -100*(600y -3y\u00b2) +2,000,000\n\nCompute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 300y\u00b2 -2y\u00b3,\n\nSecond term: -100*(600y -3y\u00b2) = -60,000y + 300y\u00b2,\n\nThird term: +2,000,000.\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n300y\u00b2 -2y\u00b3 -60,000y +300y\u00b2 +2,000,000.\n\nTotal:\n\n(300y\u00b2 +300y\u00b2) =600y\u00b2,\n\n-2y\u00b3,\n\n-60,000y,\n\n+2,000,000.\n\nThus the equation is:\n\n-2y\u00b3 +600y\u00b2 -60,000y +2,000,000 =0,\n\nwhich is equivalent to:\n\n2y\u00b3 -600y\u00b2 +60,000y -2,000,000=0 \u21d2 y\u00b3 -300y\u00b2 +30,000y -1,000,000=0,\n\nas before.\n\nBut when I plug y=90 into this equation:\n\nLeft-hand side (LHS):\n\n90\u00b3 -300*(90)^2 +30,000*90 -1,000,000\n\nCompute each term:\n\n90\u00b3 = 729,000,\n\n300*(90)^2 = 300*8,100 =2,430,000,\n\n30,000*90 =2,700,000,\n\nThus,\n\n729,000 -2,430,000 +2,700,000 -1,000,000 =\n\n729,000 -2,430,000 = -1,701,000,\n\n-1,701,000 +2,700,000 = 999,000,\n\n999,000 -1,000,000 = -1,000. Not zero.\n\nHmm, so that contradicts the earlier result? Wait, but earlier when I plugged in (120,90,90), it worked. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let me recalculate the equation for y=90:\n\nWait, the cubic equation is:\n\ny\u00b3 -300y\u00b2 +30,000y -1,000,000.\n\nPlugging y=90:\n\n90^3 = 729,000,\n\n-300*(90)^2 = -300*8,100 = -2,430,000,\n\n+30,000*90 = +2,700,000,\n\n-1,000,000.\n\nSo total:\n\n729,000 -2,430,000 = -1,701,000,\n\nplus 2,700,000: 999,000,\n\nminus 1,000,000: -1,000. Not zero. Hmm.\n\nBut when I actually computed the terms for (120,90,90), the total was 6,000,000. So there must be an error in the setup. Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the equation setup.\n\nWait, let me recheck the equation. The original equation after substitution for two variables equal:\n\nThe equation is:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nBut when I set a =300 - 2y, b=y, c=y,\n\nabc = (300-2y)*y*y,\n\nab + bc + ca = (300-2y)*y + y*y + (300-2y)*y,\n\nWait, that's (300-2y)*y (for ab) + y*y (for bc) + (300-2y)*y (for ca). So indeed, that's 2*(300-2y)*y + y\u00b2.\n\nWait, but in my calculation above, I think I added them correctly. So perhaps the error is somewhere else.\n\nWait but when I computed the terms for (120,90,90), I got 6,000,000, so that solution should satisfy the equation, but according to the cubic equation, it doesn't. Contradiction. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps an arithmetic mistake in the cubic equation.\n\nWait let me recompute the substitution.\n\nLet me re-derive the equation step by step for two variables equal (b = c = y, a = 300 - 2y):\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0,\n\nPlugging in:\n\nabc = a*y*y = (300-2y)*y\u00b2,\n\nab + bc + ca = a*y + y*y + a*y = 2a*y + y\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\n(300-2y)*y\u00b2 - 100*(2*(300-2y)*y + y\u00b2) +2,000,000 =0,\n\nExpand:\n\nFirst term: 300y\u00b2 -2y\u00b3,\n\nSecond term inside the brackets: 2*(300-2y)*y = 600y -4y\u00b2,\n\nAdding y\u00b2 gives total inside brackets: 600y -3y\u00b2,\n\nMultiply by -100: -60,000y + 300y\u00b2,\n\nThird term: +2,000,000.\n\nSo total equation:\n\n300y\u00b2 -2y\u00b3 -60,000y +300y\u00b2 +2,000,000 =0,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n300y\u00b2 +300y\u00b2 =600y\u00b2,\n\n-2y\u00b3,\n\n-60,000y,\n\n+2,000,000,\n\nThus:\n\n-2y\u00b3 +600y\u00b2 -60,000y +2,000,000 =0,\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo when I plugged in y=90, the LHS is -1,000, not zero. But when we computed the actual terms for (120,90,90), the total was 6,000,000. So there must be an error in the manual calculation? Wait let me check the computation again:\n\nWait, for a=120, b=90, c=90:\n\nCompute the second equation: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nBreaking down each term:\n\na\u00b2b =120\u00b2*90 =14,400 *90 =1,296,000,\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b since c is also 90, so another 1,296,000,\n\nb\u00b2a =90\u00b2*120 =8,100*120=972,000,\n\nb\u00b2c =90\u00b2*90 =8,100*90=729,000,\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a=972,000,\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c=729,000.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1,296,000 +1,296,000 =2,592,000,\n\n+972,000 \u21923,564,000,\n\n+729,000 \u21924,293,000,\n\n+972,000 \u21925,265,000,\n\n+729,000 \u21926,000,000.\n\nThat's correct. So the problem is that according to the equation, when y=90, it should not satisfy the equation, but it does. So something is wrong here.\n\nWait, but according to the equation derived when setting two variables equal, it should not be a solution. But it is. So perhaps my equation setup was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.\n\nWait, the main equation is:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =0.\n\nBut in the case of (120, 90,90):\n\nabc =120*90*90=972,000,\n\nab + bc + ca =120*90 +90*90 +120*90 =10,800 +8,100 +10,800=29,700,\n\nThus:\n\n972,000 -100*(29,700) +2,000,000 =972,000 -2,970,000 +2,000,000 = (972,000 +2,000,000) -2,970,000 =2,972,000 -2,970,000 = 2,000.\n\nWait a second! Wait this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait this can't be.\n\nHold on, let me recalculate the equation using abc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000:\n\nabc is 120*90*90 = 120*8,100 = 972,000.\n\nab + bc + ca:\n\nab =120*90=10,800,\n\nbc=90*90=8,100,\n\nca=120*90=10,800,\n\nTotal:10,800+8,100+10,800=29,700.\n\nSo abc -100*(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000 =\n\n972,000 -100*29,700 +2,000,000 =\n\n972,000 -2,970,000 +2,000,000 =\n\n(972,000 + 2,000,000) -2,970,000 =\n\n2,972,000 -2,970,000 =2,000.\n\nBut this is not zero. Wait, so this contradicts my previous calculation where I added up all the terms of the second equation and got 6,000,000. What is going on?\n\nWait, the confusion is arising because the original second equation given in the problem is:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b =6,000,000.\n\nBut when I derived the equation, I used the identity that this expression equals (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Let me verify that.\n\nGiven that:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2) + 3abc,\n\nso the given expression (the left side of the problem's second equation) is equal to (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nTherefore, the equation given in the problem is:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc =6,000,000.\n\nSince a + b + c =300, this becomes:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) -3abc =6,000,000,\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc =2,000,000,\n\nwhich is the equation I used earlier.\n\nHowever, when I computed for the case (120,90,90):\n\nabc =120*90*90 = 972,000,\n\nab + bc + ca =29,700,\n\nTherefore,\n\n100*(29,700) -972,000 =2,970,000 -972,000 =1,998,000,\n\nWhich is not equal to 2,000,000. Therefore, this does NOT satisfy the equation. Wait, but earlier when I added all terms of the original second equation, I thought I got 6,000,000. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the original second equation for (120,90,90):\n\nCompute a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =120\u00b2 *90 =14,400*90 =1,296,000,\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b since c is also 90: 1,296,000,\n\nb\u00b2a =90\u00b2 *120 =8,100*120=972,000,\n\nb\u00b2c =90\u00b2 *90 =8,100*90=729,000,\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a =972,000,\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c =729,000.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1,296,000 +1,296,000 =2,592,000,\n\n+972,000 =3,564,000,\n\n+729,000 =4,293,000,\n\n+972,000 =5,265,000,\n\n+729,000 =6,000,000.\n\nWait, but according to the other equation, it should be 1,998,000? There's a discrepancy here. Which is correct?\n\nWait, let me check the identity again.\n\nThe identity says:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nLet me compute both sides for this case:\n\nLeft side:6,000,000.\n\nRight side:300*(ab + bc + ca) -3abc.\n\nCompute ab + bc + ca =29,700,\n\n300*29,700 =8,910,000,\n\n3abc=3*972,000=2,916,000,\n\nThus, right side:8,910,000 -2,916,000=5,994,000,\n\nWhich is not equal to 6,000,000. So there's a discrepancy here. Wait, so the identity must be wrong?\n\nWait no, let me recompute ab + bc + ca for a=120, b=90, c=90:\n\nab =120*90 =10,800,\n\nbc=90*90=8,100,\n\nca=120*90=10,800,\n\nTotal:10,800+8,100+10,800 =29,700. Correct.\n\nThen (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=300*29,700 =8,910,000.\n\nThen subtract 3abc=3*(120*90*90)=3*(972,000)=2,916,000,\n\nThus 8,910,000 -2,916,000 =5,994,000.\n\nBut the left side was computed as6,000,000. Where is this difference coming from?\n\nAh! Wait a second, my manual summation of the terms is incorrect.\n\nWait, let me recompute the terms:\n\na\u00b2b:120\u00b2 *90 = (14,400)*90=1,296,000,\n\na\u00b2c: same as a\u00b2b because c is also 90, so 1,296,000,\n\nb\u00b2a:90\u00b2 *120 =8,100 *120=972,000,\n\nb\u00b2c:90\u00b2 *90 =8,100*90=729,000,\n\nc\u00b2a: same as b\u00b2a because c and b are the same: 972,000,\n\nc\u00b2b: same as b\u00b2c: 729,000.\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1,296,000 (a\u00b2b) + 1,296,000 (a\u00b2c) =2,592,000,\n\n+972,000 (b\u00b2a) \u2192 3,564,000,\n\n+729,000 (b\u00b2c) \u21924,293,000,\n\n+972,000 (c\u00b2a) \u21925,265,000,\n\n+729,000 (c\u00b2b) \u21925,994,000.\n\nAh! So my mistake was in the final addition step earlier. The correct total is 5,994,000, not 6,000,000. Therefore, (120,90,90) is NOT a solution. That was my error in adding. So that combination does NOT satisfy the equation. Therefore, my earlier calculation was wrong, leading me astray. So that case is invalid.\n\nTherefore, there must be an error in my initial calculation when I thought (120,90,90) worked. It actually does not. Thus, the equation setup is correct and the cubic only allows y=100, so the only solution when two variables are equal is the all-equal case.\n\nThus, only the all-equal case, the cases with a zero, and the 3:2:1 ratios are valid. Let me confirm with the previous example (150,100,50).\n\nLet me check using the equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000=?\n\nFor (150,100,50):\n\nabc=150*100*50=750,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=150*100 +100*50 +150*50 =15,000+5,000+7,500=27,500,\n\nThus,\n\n750,000 -100*(27,500) +2,000,000 =\n\n750,000 -2,750,000 +2,000,000 =\n\n(750,000 +2,000,000) -2,750,000 =2,750,000 -2,750,000=0. Yes, so that works.\n\nSo that combination works, and the cubic equation didn't account for it because it requires all three variables to be distinct.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solutions are:\n\n1. The all-equal triple (100,100,100).\n\n2. The triples where one variable is zero and the other two are 200 and 100 in some permutation. There are 3 choices for which variable is zero, and for each, two permutations of the non-zero variables, totaling 3\u00d72=6 solutions.\n\n3. The triples in the ratio 3:2:1, which are (150,100,50) and its permutations. Since all three numbers are distinct, there are 3! =6 permutations.\n\nSo total solutions are 1 +6+6=13.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if there are any other ratios or solutions.\n\nSuppose variables are in ratio 2:3:5. Let me see:\n\nLet me set a=2t, b=3t, c=5t. Total:10t=300 \u21d2 t=30. Thus a=60, b=90, c=150. Let me check this:\n\nCompute the equation:\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000.\n\nabc=60\u00d790\u00d7150 =60\u00d713,500=810,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=60\u00d790 +90\u00d7150 +60\u00d7150=5,400 +13,500 +9,000=27,900,\n\nThus,\n\n810,000 -100\u00d727,900 +2,000,000 =810,000 -2,790,000 +2,000,000 = (810,000 +2,000,000) -2,790,000 =2,810,000 -2,790,000=20,000\u22600. Doesn't work.\n\nHmm. Not valid.\n\nAnother ratio: 4:1:5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the only valid ratios are 3:2:1 and the cases with zero.\n\nWait, let's see another ratio. Maybe 6:3:1. Let me try:\n\na=6t, b=3t, c=t. Total:10t=300 \u21d2t=30. Thus a=180, b=90, c=30.\n\nCompute:\n\nabc=180\u00d790\u00d730=486,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=180\u00d790 +90\u00d730 +180\u00d730=16,200 +2,700 +5,400=24,300,\n\nThus,\n\n486,000 -100\u00d724,300 +2,000,000 =486,000 -2,430,000 +2,000,000= (486,000 +2,000,000) -2,430,000=2,486,000 -2,430,000=56,000\u22600. Not valid.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps another ratio, like 5:4:1?\n\nLet a=5t, b=4t, c=t. Total:10t=300 \u21d2t=30. So a=150, b=120, c=30.\n\nCompute:\n\nabc=150\u00d7120\u00d730=540,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=150\u00d7120 +120\u00d730 +150\u00d730=18,000+3,600+4,500=26,100,\n\nThus,\n\n540,000 -100\u00d726,100 +2,000,000=540,000 -2,610,000 +2,000,000= (540,000+2,000,000) -2,610,000=2,540,000-2,610,000= -70,000\u22600. Not valid.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the only non-trivial solutions are the 3:2:1 ratio and the zero cases.\n\nWait, let me try another ratio. Suppose variables are in ratio 1:1:1, which is the all-equal case.\n\nSo apart from these, maybe there's another ratio?\n\nWait, let me try (200,100,0) which we've already considered. It is part of the zero case.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of another approach. Let me consider the equation:\n\nabc =100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000.\n\nSuppose that variables are positive integers (none zero). Let me see if I can find all triples (a,b,c) where a+b+c=300 and satisfy this equation.\n\nLet me consider the ratio 3:2:1. Let me see if there are other ratios.\n\nSuppose that variables are in ratio k: m: n, where k + m + n = 6 (since 3+2+1=6, and 300=6*50). So scaling factor t=50. So any ratio with k + m + n =6 might be a candidate?\n\nWait, but when I tried 4:3:3 which sum to 10, but scaled to 300, but that didn't work.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that the variables must be in the ratio 3:2:1. Let me see if that's the only possibility.\n\nSuppose that there is a solution where a = 3t, b=2t, c=t. Then a + b + c =6t=300 \u21d2 t=50. So this gives (150,100,50). This works.\n\nAre there other ratios where variables can be written as multiples of integers adding to the same total?\n\nSuppose variables are in ratio p:q:r where p + q + r =k and 6t=300 \u21d2 t=50.\n\nWait, perhaps the only solution with distinct variables is the 3:2:1 ratio. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, suppose variables are in ratio 6:3:1 (sum 10). But that would require t=30, but earlier it didn't work.\n\nAlternatively, suppose variables are in ratio 5:1:4 (sum 10). Let me try:\n\na=5t, b=1t, c=4t \u21d2 sum=10t=300 \u21d2t=30. So a=150, b=30, c=120.\n\nCheck if this works.\n\nabc=150\u00d730\u00d7120=540,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=150\u00d730 +30\u00d7120 +150\u00d7120=4,500+3,600+18,000=26,100,\n\nThus,\n\n540,000 -100\u00d726,100 +2,000,000 =540,000 -2,610,000 +2,000,000= same as before= -70,000\u22600.\n\nNope.\n\nHmm. So maybe only the 3:2:1 ratio works. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps variables can be in ratios where scaling factor t divides 300 in a way that works. For instance, in the 3:2:1 case, the total parts are 6, so t=50, an integer.\n\nPerhaps other ratios where the total parts divide 300?\n\nLet me try ratio 4:1:1 (total parts 6). Wait, 4+1+1=6, so scaling t=50:\n\na=200, b=50, c=50. Let me check this:\n\nabc=200\u00d750\u00d750=500,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=200\u00d750 +50\u00d750 +200\u00d750=10,000+2,500+10,000=22,500,\n\nThus,\n\n500,000 -100\u00d722,500 +2,000,000 =500,000 -2,250,000 +2,000,000=250,000\u22600.\n\nDoesn't work.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, ratio 5:2:3 (total parts 10). 5+2+3=10, t=30:\n\na=150, b=60, c=90.\n\nWait, tried this earlier and got discrepancy. Let me check again:\n\nabc=150\u00d760\u00d790=810,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=150\u00d760 +60\u00d790 +150\u00d790=9,000 +5,400 +13,500=27,900,\n\nThus,\n\n810,000 -100\u00d727,900 +2,000,000 =810,000 -2,790,000 +2,000,000=20,000\u22600.\n\nNo good.\n\nHmm, so perhaps only the 3:2:1 ratio works. Let me see another way.\n\nLet me let variables be a=3t, b=2t, c=t. Then indeed, a+b+c=6t=300 \u21d2 t=50.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation:\n\nabc =3t\u00d72t\u00d7t=6t\u00b3,\n\nab + bc + ca=3t\u00d72t +2t\u00d7t +3t\u00d7t=6t\u00b2 +2t\u00b2 +3t\u00b2=11t\u00b2,\n\nThus the equation:\n\nabc =100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000,\n\nbecomes:\n\n6t\u00b3 =100*(11t\u00b2) -2,000,000 \u21d26t\u00b3 =1,100t\u00b2 -2,000,000.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n6t\u00b3 -1,100t\u00b2 +2,000,000=0.\n\nLet me plug t=50:\n\n6*(125,000) -1,100*(2,500) +2,000,000.\n\n=750,000 -2,750,000 +2,000,000=0. Works.\n\nSo this ratio is valid. Let me see if there are other integer t that satisfy this equation.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n6t\u00b3 -1,100t\u00b2 +2,000,000=0 \u21d2 divide by 2: 3t\u00b3 -550t\u00b2 +1,000,000=0.\n\nLooking for integer solutions t.\n\nWe know t=50 is a solution. Factor out (t-50):\n\nUse polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDivide 3t\u00b3 -550t\u00b2 +1,000,000 by (t-50).\n\nUsing synthetic division:\n\nRoot at t=50:\n\nCoefficients:3 | -550 | 0 |1,000,000 (Wait, the polynomial is 3t\u00b3 -550t\u00b2 +1,000,000. So coefficients are 3, -550, 0, 1,000,000? Wait no, the polynomial is 3t\u00b3 -550t\u00b2 +1,000,000. So coefficients are 3, -550, 0, 1,000,000? Wait, no, actually:\n\nWait, 3t\u00b3 -550t\u00b2 +1,000,000 is equivalent to 3t\u00b3 -550t\u00b2 +0t +1,000,000. So coefficients are 3, -550, 0, 1,000,000.\n\nUsing synthetic division with t=50:\n\nStart with 3,\n\nBring down 3.\n\nMultiply by50: 150,\n\nAdd to next coefficient: -550 +150 =-400.\n\nMultiply by50: -20,000.\n\nAdd to next coefficient (0): -20,000.\n\nMultiply by50: -1,000,000.\n\nAdd to last term:1,000,000 + (-1,000,000)=0.\n\nSo the polynomial factors as (t -50)(3t\u00b2 -400t -20,000).\n\nSet the quadratic to zero:\n\n3t\u00b2 -400t -20,000 =0.\n\nDiscriminant D= (400)^2 +4*3*20,000 =160,000 +240,000=400,000.\n\n\u221aD=632.45\u2026 Not a perfect square, so no integer solutions.\n\nHence, the only integer solution is t=50. Therefore, the only solution in the ratio 3:2:1 is the one we found.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are:\n\n1. (100,100,100),\n\n2. All permutations of (200,100,0), which are 6 solutions,\n\n3. All permutations of (150,100,50), which are 6 solutions.\n\nTotal solutions:1+6+6=13.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if there are any other possibilities where variables are not in these ratios but still satisfy the equation.\n\nSuppose we have a solution where variables are different from these ratios, say (180, 90, 30). Wait, tried that and it didn't work. What about (180, 60, 60):\n\nCompute a +b +c=180+60+60=300,\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc =180\u00d760\u00d760=648,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=180\u00d760+60\u00d760+180\u00d760=10,800+3,600+10,800=25,200,\n\nThus,\n\n648,000 -100\u00d725,200 +2,000,000=648,000 -2,520,000 +2,000,000=128,000\u22600.\n\nNo good.\n\nAnother try: (160, 100,40):\n\nSum is 300,\n\nabc=160\u00d7100\u00d740=640,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=160\u00d7100 +100\u00d740 +160\u00d740=16,000+4,000+6,400=26,400,\n\nThus,\n\n640,000 -100\u00d726,400 +2,000,000=640,000 -2,640,000 +2,000,000= 0? Let me see:\n\n640,000 +2,000,000 =2,640,000,\n\nSubtract 2,640,000 gives 0. Wait, this works!\n\nWait, so (160,100,40) is also a solution? Let me verify.\n\nCompute the original second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na=160, b=100, c=40.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =160\u00b2\u00d7100 =25,600\u00d7100=2,560,000,\n\na\u00b2c=25,600\u00d740=1,024,000,\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2\u00d7160=10,000\u00d7160=1,600,000,\n\nb\u00b2c=10,000\u00d740=400,000,\n\nc\u00b2a=40\u00b2\u00d7160=1,600\u00d7160=256,000,\n\nc\u00b2b=1,600\u00d7100=160,000.\n\nSum all terms:\n\n2,560,000 +1,024,000 =3,584,000,\n\n+1,600,000 \u21925,184,000,\n\n+400,000 \u21925,584,000,\n\n+256,000 \u21925,840,000,\n\n+160,000 \u21926,000,000. That works!\n\nSo (160,100,40) is also a solution. But this is not in the ratio 3:2:1. Let me see:\n\nCheck the ratio:\n\n160:100:40 simplifies to 16:10:4 \u2192 8:5:2. So the ratio 8:5:2.\n\nWait, so this is a new ratio. So there are more solutions.\n\nHmm, so my previous conclusion was incomplete. Need to consider other ratios.\n\nLet me see what ratio this is. 160:100:40 can be divided by 20: 8:5:2. So ratio 8:5:2.\n\nLet me check if this ratio works generally.\n\nLet variables be a=8t, b=5t, c=2t. Then a+b+c=15t=300 \u21d2t=20.\n\nThen a=160, b=100, c=40. Which is the solution we found.\n\nLet me verify the equation using the ratio:\n\nabc =8t\u00d75t\u00d72t=80t\u00b3,\n\nab + bc + ca=8t\u00d75t +5t\u00d72t +8t\u00d72t=40t\u00b2 +10t\u00b2 +16t\u00b2=66t\u00b2,\n\nThus the equation:\n\nabc =100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000,\n\nSubstitute:\n\n80t\u00b3 =100*(66t\u00b2) -2,000,000,\n\n80t\u00b3 =6,600t\u00b2 -2,000,000,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n80t\u00b3 -6,600t\u00b2 +2,000,000=0,\n\nDivide by 20: 4t\u00b3 -330t\u00b2 +100,000=0.\n\nLet me plug t=20:\n\n4*(8000) -330*(400) +100,000 =32,000 -132,000 +100,000=0. Yes, works.\n\nSo this ratio also works. Thus, there is another solution family with ratio 8:5:2.\n\nHow many permutations does this have? Since all variables are distinct (8,5,2 are distinct), the number of permutations is 6.\n\nTherefore, this adds another 6 solutions.\n\nWait, so now we have more solutions. This complicates things further.\n\nLet me see if there are more such ratios.\n\nLet me suppose variables are in ratio p:q:r, such that the equation holds. Let me think of this as a system where:\n\nLet a = pt, b=qt, c=rt,\n\nWith p + q + r =k,\n\nand the equation:\n\n(pqr)t\u00b3 = 100*(pq + qr + rp)t\u00b2 -2,000,000,\n\nand also, since a + b + c = (p+q+r)t =300 \u21d2 t=300/k.\n\nSubstitute t=300/k into the equation:\n\npqr*(300/k)^3 =100*(pq + qr + rp)*(300/k)^2 -2,000,000.\n\nMultiply both sides by k^3:\n\npqr*300^3 =100*(pq + qr + rp)*300^2 *k -2,000,000 *k^3.\n\nThis seems complex, but perhaps we can look for integer ratios where this holds.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other small integer ratios.\n\nLet me see the previous ratios:\n\n3:2:1 (sum 6),\n\n8:5:2 (sum15),\n\nAre there others?\n\nLet me try ratio 5:3:2 (sum 10). Let me see:\n\nLet a=5t, b=3t, c=2t \u21d2 total=10t=300 \u21d2t=30.\n\nThen:\n\nabc=5\u00d73\u00d72 t\u00b3=30t\u00b3=30*(27,000)=810,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=5t\u00d73t +3t\u00d72t +5t\u00d72t=15t\u00b2 +6t\u00b2 +10t\u00b2=31t\u00b2=31*(900)=27,900,\n\nThus,\n\nabc -100(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000=810,000 -2,790,000 +2,000,000=20,000\u22600.\n\nDoesn't work.\n\nAnother ratio 9:4:3 (sum 16). Let me try:\n\na=9t, b=4t, c=3t \u21d2 total=16t=300 \u21d2t=18.75. Not integer.\n\nRatio 7:5:2 (sum14):\n\na=7t, b=5t, c=2t \u21d2 total=14t=300 \u21d2t\u224821.428. Not integer.\n\nAnother ratio 6:5:1 (sum12):\n\nt=25 \u21d2 a=150, b=125, c=25.\n\nCheck:\n\nabc=150\u00d7125\u00d725=468,750,\n\nab + bc + ca=150\u00d7125 +125\u00d725 +150\u00d725=18,750+3,125+3,750=25,625,\n\nThus,\n\n468,750 -100\u00d725,625 +2,000,000=468,750 -2,562,500 +2,000,000= (468,750 +2,000,000) -2,562,500 =2,468,750 -2,562,500 =-93,750\u22600.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother ratio 4:3:5 (sum12):\n\nWait, 4+3+5=12 \u21d2t=25.\n\na=100, b=75, c=125,\n\nabc=100\u00d775\u00d7125=937,500,\n\nab + bc + ca=100\u00d775 +75\u00d7125 +100\u00d7125=7,500+9,375+12,500=29,375,\n\nThus,\n\n937,500 -100\u00d729,375 +2,000,000=937,500 -2,937,500 +2,000,000=0? Let's see:\n\n937,500 +2,000,000 =2,937,500,\n\nSubtract 2,937,500 gives 0. So this works!\n\nThus, (100,75,125) is a solution. The ratio here is 4:3:5 (scaled by t=25).\n\nSo this is another valid ratio.\n\nCheck the terms:\n\na=100, b=75, c=125,\n\nCompute the original second equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\na\u00b2b =100\u00b2\u00d775 =10,000\u00d775=750,000,\n\na\u00b2c =10,000\u00d7125=1,250,000,\n\nb\u00b2a =75\u00b2\u00d7100=5,625\u00d7100=562,500,\n\nb\u00b2c=5,625\u00d7125=703,125,\n\nc\u00b2a=125\u00b2\u00d7100=15,625\u00d7100=1,562,500,\n\nc\u00b2b=15,625\u00d775=1,171,875.\n\nAdding them all:\n\n750,000 +1,250,000=2,000,000,\n\n+562,500 \u21922,562,500,\n\n+703,125 \u21923,265,625,\n\n+1,562,500 \u21924,828,125,\n\n+1,171,875 \u21926,000,000. Perfect.\n\nSo this is another solution with ratio 4:3:5.\n\nThus, the ratio 4:3:5 also works. Let me see how.\n\nLet me analyze this ratio:\n\nLet variables be a=4t, b=3t, c=5t. Then sum is 12t=300 \u21d2t=25.\n\nThen abc=4t\u00d73t\u00d75t=60t\u00b3,\n\nab + bc + ca=4t\u00d73t +3t\u00d75t +4t\u00d75t=12t\u00b2 +15t\u00b2 +20t\u00b2=47t\u00b2,\n\nEquation:\n\nabc =100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000,\n\n60t\u00b3 =100\u00d747t\u00b2 -2,000,000 \u21d260t\u00b3 =4,700t\u00b2 -2,000,000,\n\nRearranged:60t\u00b3 -4,700t\u00b2 +2,000,000=0,\n\nDivide by 20:3t\u00b3 -235t\u00b2 +100,000=0,\n\nPlug t=25:\n\n3*(15,625) -235*(625) +100,000,\n\n=46,875 -146,875 +100,000=0. Yes.\n\nThus, this ratio works.\n\nTherefore, there are additional solutions from this ratio (4:3:5), which gives permutations (100,75,125) etc. Since all three numbers are distinct, there are 6 permutations.\n\nThus, this adds another 6 solutions.\n\nSo now, the total solutions are:\n\n1. All-equal:1,\n\n2. Zero cases:6,\n\n3. 3:2:1 ratio permutations:6,\n\n4.8:5:2 ratio permutations:6,\n\n5.4:3:5 ratio permutations:6,\n\nTotal so far:1+6+6+6+6=25.\n\nWait, but I need to check if there are more ratios.\n\nLet me see another ratio. Let's try 5:4:3 (sum12). Let me see:\n\na=5t, b=4t, c=3t \u21d212t=300 \u21d2t=25.\n\nThus a=125, b=100, c=75.\n\nCheck the equation:\n\nabc=125\u00d7100\u00d775=937,500,\n\nab + bc + ca=125\u00d7100 +100\u00d775 +125\u00d775=12,500+7,500+9,375=29,375,\n\nThus,\n\n937,500 -100\u00d729,375 +2,000,000= same as previous case 4:3:5, which gives zero. So this is the same as the 4:3:5 ratio but reordered. So (125,100,75) is a permutation of (100,75,125). So it's already counted in the previous ratio's permutations.\n\nSimilarly, the 4:3:5 ratio includes all permutations, so this is covered.\n\nAnother ratio: Let me try 9:6:1 (sum16):\n\na=9t, b=6t, c=t \u21d216t=300 \u21d2t=18.75, not integer.\n\nRatio 7:6:2 (sum15):\n\na=7t, b=6t, c=2t \u21d215t=300 \u21d2t=20,\n\nThus, a=140, b=120, c=40.\n\nCheck the equation:\n\nabc=140\u00d7120\u00d740=672,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=140\u00d7120 +120\u00d740 +140\u00d740=16,800+4,800+5,600=27,200,\n\nThus,\n\n672,000 -100\u00d727,200 +2,000,000=672,000 -2,720,000 +2,000,000= (672,000+2,000,000) -2,720,000=2,672,000-2,720,000= -48,000\u22600.\n\nDoesn't work.\n\nAnother ratio: 10:5:5 (sum20). Then a=10t, b=5t, c=5t \u21d220t=300 \u21d2t=15.\n\nThus a=150, b=75, c=75.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=150\u00d775\u00d775=843,750,\n\nab + bc + ca=150\u00d775 +75\u00d775 +150\u00d775=11,250+5,625+11,250=28,125,\n\nThus,\n\n843,750 -100\u00d728,125 +2,000,000=843,750 -2,812,500 +2,000,000= (843,750+2,000,000) -2,812,500=2,843,750-2,812,500=31,250\u22600.\n\nNo good.\n\nAnother ratio: 6:4:2 (sum12). Which simplifies to 3:2:1, already considered.\n\nHmm, so let me think of another possible ratio.\n\nLet me consider the ratio 5:2:3 (sum10), which we tried before, but maybe with a different arrangement:\n\nWait, let me try ratio 6:5:4 (sum15):\n\na=6t, b=5t, c=4t \u21d215t=300 \u21d2t=20,\n\nThus a=120, b=100, c=80.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=120\u00d7100\u00d780=960,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=120\u00d7100 +100\u00d780 +120\u00d780=12,000+8,000+9,600=29,600,\n\nThus,\n\n960,000 -100\u00d729,600 +2,000,000=960,000 -2,960,000 +2,000,000= (960,000+2,000,000) -2,960,000=2,960,000-2,960,000=0. Works!\n\nThus, (120,100,80) is a solution with ratio 6:5:4.\n\nCheck the original equation:\n\na=120, b=100, c=80.\n\nCompute terms:\n\na\u00b2b =120\u00b2\u00d7100=14,400\u00d7100=1,440,000,\n\na\u00b2c =14,400\u00d780=1,152,000,\n\nb\u00b2a =100\u00b2\u00d7120=10,000\u00d7120=1,200,000,\n\nb\u00b2c =10,000\u00d780=800,000,\n\nc\u00b2a =80\u00b2\u00d7120=6,400\u00d7120=768,000,\n\nc\u00b2b =6,400\u00d7100=640,000.\n\nSumming all terms:\n\n1,440,000 +1,152,000 =2,592,000,\n\n+1,200,000 \u21923,792,000,\n\n+800,000 \u21924,592,000,\n\n+768,000 \u21925,360,000,\n\n+640,000 \u21926,000,000. Perfect.\n\nSo this ratio 6:5:4 also works. Thus, this adds another set of 6 permutations.\n\nThis is getting quite extensive. It seems there are multiple valid ratios. I need a better way to count all possible solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for any solution with all variables positive integers, they must form a ratio p:q:r where p+q+r divides 300, and the equation is satisfied. The problem is to find all triples (a,b,c) with a+b+c=300 and satisfying the equation. Each such triple corresponds to a ratio p:q:r where p, q, r are positive integers, and the equation holds when scaled.\n\nGiven the complexity, perhaps the problem has only a few such ratios. Let me see if there are more.\n\nLet me consider the ratio 5:4:1 (sum10):\n\na=5t, b=4t, c=t \u21d210t=300 \u21d2t=30,\n\nThus a=150, b=120, c=30.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=150\u00d7120\u00d730=540,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=150\u00d7120 +120\u00d730 +150\u00d730=18,000+3,600+4,500=26,100,\n\nThus,\n\n540,000 -100\u00d726,100 +2,000,000=540,000 -2,610,000 +2,000,000= (540,000+2,000,000) -2,610,000=2,540,000-2,610,000= -70,000\u22600.\n\nDoesn't work.\n\nAnother ratio 7:7:6 (sum20):\n\na=7t, b=7t, c=6t \u21d220t=300 \u21d2t=15,\n\nThus a=105, b=105, c=90.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=105\u00d7105\u00d790=992,250,\n\nab + bc + ca=105\u00d7105 +105\u00d790 +105\u00d790=11,025+9,450+9,450=30, 000+?\n\nWait compute:\n\n105\u00d7105=11,025,\n\n105\u00d790=9,450,\n\n105\u00d790=9,450,\n\nTotal ab + bc + ca=11,025+9,450+9,450=30, 000-?\n\nWait 11,025+9,450=20,475+9,450=30, 000-?\n\nWait 20,475 +9,450=30, 000-?\n\n20,475+9,450=29,925.\n\nThus,\n\nabc -100*(ab + bc + ca) +2,000,000=992,250 -100\u00d729,925 +2,000,000,\n\n=992,250 -2,992,500 +2,000,000,\n\n= (992,250+2,000,000) -2,992,500=2,992,250-2,992,500= -250\u22600.\n\nNope.\n\nLet me try ratio 9:4:2 (sum15):\n\na=9t, b=4t, c=2t \u21d215t=300 \u21d2t=20,\n\nThus a=180, b=80, c=40.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=180\u00d780\u00d740=576,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=180\u00d780 +80\u00d740 +180\u00d740=14,400+3,200+7,200=24,800,\n\nThus,\n\n576,000 -100\u00d724,800 +2,000,000=576,000 -2,480,000 +2,000,000= (576,000+2,000,000) -2,480,000=2,576,000-2,480,000=96,000\u22600.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother ratio: 7:6:2 (sum15):\n\na=7t, b=6t, c=2t \u21d215t=300 \u21d2t=20,\n\nThus a=140, b=120, c=40,\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=140\u00d7120\u00d740=672,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=140\u00d7120 +120\u00d740 +140\u00d740=16,800+4,800+5,600=27,200,\n\nThus,\n\n672,000 -2,720,000 +2,000,000= (672,000+2,000,000) -2,720,000=2,672,000-2,720,000= -48,000\u22600.\n\nNo.\n\nHmm, so the valid ratios I've found so far are:\n\n1. 3:2:1 (sum6),\n\n2. 8:5:2 (sum15),\n\n3. 4:3:5 (sum12),\n\n4. 6:5:4 (sum15).\n\nWait, let's check the ratio 6:5:4:\n\nYes, that's valid and gives 6 permutations.\n\nThus, each of these ratios gives 6 permutations (since all numbers are distinct), except possibly if any numbers are equal in the ratio.\n\nLet me verify if there are more such ratios.\n\nLet me try ratio 5:4:3 (sum12):\n\nThis is the same as 4:3:5, just reordered.

Perhaps I need to consider that each valid ratio corresponds to a solution of the equation 6t\u00b3 -1,100t\u00b2 +2,000,000=0 for 3:2:1,\n\nSimilarly for other ratios.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation:\n\nLet me suppose variables are in the ratio p:q:r,\n\nthen:\n\n(pqr)t\u00b3 =100*(pq + qr + rp)t\u00b2 -2,000,000,\n\nwith (p+q+r)t =300 \u21d2t=300/(p+q+r),\n\nSubstitute t into the equation:\n\npqr*(300/(p+q+r))\u00b3 =100*(pq + qr + rp)*(300/(p+q+r))\u00b2 -2,000,000,\n\nMultiply both sides by (p+q+r)^3:\n\npqr*300\u00b3 =100*(pq + qr + rp)*300\u00b2*(p+q+r) -2,000,000*(p+q+r)^3,\n\nThis is a complex equation, but perhaps we can find integer solutions where the ratio p:q:r are integers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to look for all triples (a, b, c) such that:\n\nabc = 100(ab + bc + ca) -2,000,000,\n\nand a + b + c =300.\n\nThis equation can be rewritten as:\n\nabc -100ab -100bc -100ca +2,000,000 =0.\n\nPerhaps factor this equation?\n\nLet me see:\n\nabc -100ab -100bc -100ca +2,000,000 =0.\n\nHmm, not obvious. Maybe add and subtract terms to factor.\n\nAlternatively, rearrange terms:\n\nabc -100ab -100bc -100ca + 1,000,000 +1,000,000 =0.\n\nHmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables x=a-100, y=b-100, z=c-100. Then a=x+100, etc. Maybe this substitution might help?\n\nBut since a + b + c=300, we have x + y + z =0.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that in the all-equal case, a=b=c=100, so perhaps this equation is symmetric around 100.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to consider possible triples where variables are multiples of 50, since in the known cases (3:2:1) the scaling factor is 50.\n\nLet me suppose variables are multiples of 50, so let a=50p, b=50q, c=50r, then p+q+r=6, scaled by 50.\n\nThen the equation becomes:\n\n(50p)(50q)(50r) =100*(50p\u00d750q +50q\u00d750r +50p\u00d750r) -2,000,000,\n\nSimplify:\n\n50^3 pqr =100*(50^2 (pq + qr + pr)) -2,000,000,\n\n125,000 pqr =100*(2,500 (pq + qr + pr)) -2,000,000,\n\n125,000 pqr =250,000 (pq + qr + pr) -2,000,000,\n\nDivide both sides by 25,000:\n\n5 pqr =10 (pq + qr + pr) -80,\n\nThus,\n\n5pqr -10(pq + qr + pr) +80 =0.\n\nWe need p+q+r=6, with p, q, r positive integers.\n\nLet me search for integer solutions p, q, r \u22651, p+q+r=6, satisfying 5pqr -10(pq + qr + pr)+80=0.\n\nLet me list all triples (p,q,r) with p+q+r=6.\n\nPossible triples (sorted):\n\n(1,1,4), (1,2,3), (2,2,2).\n\nCheck each:\n\n1. (1,1,4):\n\n5*1*1*4 -10*(1*1 +1*4 +1*4) +80 =\n\n20 -10*(1+4+4)=20-10*9=20-90= -70 +80=10\u22600.\n\nNo.\n\n2. (1,2,3):\n\n5*1*2*3 -10*(1*2+2*3+1*3)+80,\n\n=30 -10*(2+6+3)=30-10*11=30-110= -80 +80=0. Works!\n\n3. (2,2,2):\n\n5*2*2*2 -10*(2*2 +2*2 +2*2)+80,\n\n=40 -10*(4+4+4)=40-120= -80 +80=0. Works!\n\nThus, the solutions in this case are:\n\n- (1,2,3) scaled by 50 gives (50,100,150) (and permutations),\n\n- (2,2,2) scaled gives (100,100,100),\n\n- (1,1,4) doesn't work.\n\nThus, these correspond to the ratios we found earlier (3:2:1) and the all-equal case.\n\nTherefore, this substitution shows that the only solutions where variables are multiples of 50 are those ratios. But there are other solutions like the 8:5:2 ratio, which is (8,5,2)*20 \u21d2 sum 15, but 15 isn't a multiple of 6, so the scaling factor isn't 50. Thus, this approach may not capture all solutions.\n\nHowever, this suggests that the only solutions with variables as multiples of 50 are the known ones. Other solutions may not be multiples of 50.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires only considering solutions where variables are multiples of some common factor?\n\nAlternatively, given the time I've spent, maybe the problem's solutions are the all-equal case, the zero cases, and the 3:2:1 ratio permutations. But earlier I found the 8:5:2 and 4:3:5 ratios also work, which add more solutions.\n\nGiven that the problem asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers, perhaps I need to consider all possible ratios that satisfy the equation.\n\nGiven the equation 5pqr -10(pq + qr + pr) +80 =0 when variables are multiples of 50, but other solutions exist outside this framework.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is designed such that only the all-equal, zero cases, and 3:2:1 ratio exist. But since I found additional solutions like (160,100,40) and (100,75,125), which are valid, the answer must account for them.\n\nWait, let me consider all possible triples that satisfy the equation:\n\nThe known valid ratios are:\n\n1. (100,100,100) \u21921 solution.\n\n2. (200,100,0) and permutations \u21926 solutions.\n\n3. (150,100,50) and permutations \u21926 solutions.\n\n4. (160,100,40) and permutations \u21926 solutions (ratio 8:5:2).\n\n5. (100,75,125) and permutations \u21926 solutions (ratio 4:3:5).\n\n6. (120,100,80) and permutations \u21926 solutions (ratio 6:5:4).\n\nWait, let me verify the ratio 6:5:4.\n\nRatio 6:5:4 (sum15),\n\na=6t, b=5t, c=4t \u21d215t=300 \u21d2t=20,\n\nThus, a=120, b=100, c=80.\n\nThis is valid, as checked before.\n\nThus, this adds another 6 solutions.\n\nTherefore, total solutions are:\n\n1+6+6+6+6+6=27?\n\nWait:\n\nLet me count:\n\n- All equal:1,\n\n- Zero cases:6,\n\n- 3:2:1 ratio (150,100,50):6,\n\n-8:5:2 (160,100,40):6,\n\n-4:3:5 (100,75,125):6,\n\n-6:5:4 (120,100,80):6.\n\nTotal 1+6+6+6+6+6=27.\n\nWait, but maybe there are more ratios?\n\nLet me check ratio 5:4:3 (sum12):\n\nThis is the same as 4:3:5 when reordered, so permutations are already counted.\n\nRatio 7:6:2 (sum15) didn't work,\n\nRatio 9:6:3 (sum18) gives non-integer scaling.\n\nAnother ratio: 10:5:5 (sum20) didn't work.\n\nRatio 7:3:10 (sum20) didn't work.\n\nRatio 12:5:3 (sum20):\n\na=12t, b=5t, c=3t \u21d220t=300 \u21d2t=15,\n\nThus a=180, b=75, c=45.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=180\u00d775\u00d745=607,500,\n\nab + bc + ca=180\u00d775 +75\u00d745 +180\u00d745=13,500+3,375+8,100=24,975,\n\nThus,\n\n607,500 -100\u00d724,975 +2,000,000=607,500 -2,497,500 +2,000,000= (607,500+2,000,000) -2,497,500=2,607,500-2,497,500=110,000\u22600.\n\nNo good.\n\nAnother ratio 7:2:1 (sum10):\n\na=7t, b=2t, c=t \u21d210t=300 \u21d2t=30,\n\nThus a=210, b=60, c=30.\n\nCheck the equation:\n\nabc=210\u00d760\u00d730=378,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=210\u00d760 +60\u00d730 +210\u00d730=12,600+1,800+6,300=20,700,\n\nThus,\n\n378,000 -100\u00d720,700 +2,000,000=378,000 -2,070,000 +2,000,000= (378,000+2,000,000) -2,070,000=2,378,000-2,070,000=308,000\u22600.\n\nNo good.\n\nAnother ratio 10:6:4 (sum20):\n\na=10t, b=6t, c=4t \u21d220t=300 \u21d2t=15,\n\nThus a=150, b=90, c=60.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=150\u00d790\u00d760=810,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=150\u00d790 +90\u00d760 +150\u00d760=13,500+5,400+9,000=27,900,\n\nThus,\n\n810,000 -2,790,000 +2,000,000=20,000\u22600.\n\nDoesn't work.\n\nHmm. So I think I've exhausted common ratios and found six distinct ratios (including all-equal and zero cases) that yield valid solutions. The total number of solutions is:\n\n- 1 (all equal),\n\n- 6 (zero cases),\n\n- 6 (3:2:1),\n\n- 6 (8:5:2),\n\n- 6 (4:3:5),\n\n- 6 (6:5:4).\n\nTotal:1+6+6+6+6+6=27.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other ratios.\n\nAnother ratio: Let me try 7:5:0 (sum12):\n\nWait, that has a zero. It would be part of the zero cases.\n\nAnother ratio: 9:3:6 (sum18):\n\nThis reduces to 3:1:2, which is same as 3:2:1 scaled.\n\nThus, I think 27 is the total.\n\nWait, but earlier when I considered the ratio 6:5:4, which gives (120,100,80), that's a distinct ratio not overlapping with previous ones. So adding those 6.\n\nTherefore, total is indeed 27.\n\nWait, but let me check another ratio: 5:5:4 (sum14):\n\na=5t, b=5t, c=4t \u21d214t=300 \u21d2t\u224821.428. Not integer.\n\nRatio 7:7:2 (sum16):\n\na=7t, b=7t, c=2t \u21d216t=300 \u21d2t=18.75. Not integer.\n\nThus, I think there are 6 distinct non-zero, non-equal ratios each contributing 6 permutations, plus the all-equal and zero cases.\n\nWait, the ratios are:\n\n1. 3:2:1,\n\n2.8:5:2,\n\n3.4:3:5,\n\n4.6:5:4.\n\nThat's four non-zero, non-equal ratios, each giving 6 permutations. So 4\u00d76=24,\n\nPlus the all-equal case (1),\n\nPlus the zero cases (6),\n\nTotal:24+1+6=31.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Earlier counted 27.\n\nWait let me clarify:\n\nThe four non-zero, non-equal ratios are:\n\n- 3:2:1,\n\n-8:5:2,\n\n-4:3:5,\n\n-6:5:4.\n\nEach of these has all three numbers distinct, so 6 permutations each \u21924\u00d76=24.\n\nAll-equal:1,\n\nZero cases:6,\n\nTotal:24+1+6=31.\n\nBut earlier when I listed the cases, counted:\n\n- All equal:1,\n\n- Zero cases:6,\n\n- 3:2:1:6,\n\n-8:5:2:6,\n\n-4:3:5:6,\n\n-6:5:4:6,\n\nTotal:1+6+6+6+6+6=27. Wait, no, the 4 ratios plus all-equal and zero cases give 1+6+ (4\u00d76)=1+6+24=31.\n\nAh, my mistake: The zero cases are separate. Each of the four ratios are non-zero, non-equal.\n\nWait, the zero cases are the ones where one variable is zero, so they are separate from the other ratios.\n\nTherefore, total solutions are:\n\nAll-equal:1,\n\nZero cases:6,\n\nFour non-zero, non-equal ratios (each with permutations):4\u00d76=24,\n\nTotal:1+6+24=31.\n\nWait, but when I listed:\n\n- All-equal:1,\n\n- zero cases:6,\n\n- 3:2:1 ratio permutations:6,\n\n-8:5:2 ratio permutations:6,\n\n-4:3:5 ratio permutations:6,\n\n-6:5:4 ratio permutations:6,\n\nTotal:1+6+6+6+6+6=27.\n\nAh, here I counted the zero cases as 6, and the four ratios (including 3:2:1) as 4\u00d76=24, but adding gives 1+6+24=31, but in the breakdown above, it's 1+6+6+6+6+6=27. The discrepancy is because when I listed the four ratios, they include the 3:2:1 (which is one of them), so the four ratios are:\n\n1.3:2:1,\n\n2.8:5:2,\n\n3.4:3:5,\n\n4.6:5:4.\n\nThus four ratios each contributing 6: 4\u00d76=24,\n\nPlus zero cases:6,\n\nPlus all-equal:1,\n\nTotal 24+6+1=31.\n\nBut when I listed them as separate entries (each ratio line being 6), that's 1 (all-equal) +6 (zeros) + four ratios each 6, totaling 1+6+ (4\u00d76)=31.\n\nHowever, the problem arises when I found the ratio 6:5:4 (120,100,80) which I hadn't considered earlier in the first count.\n\nTherefore, the correct total is 31.\n\nBut I need to confirm whether there are other ratios.\n\nWait, let me check ratio 5:2:3 (sum10). As before, it gives 20,000 discrepancy.\n\nRatio 7:5:2 (sum14):\n\na=7t, b=5t, c=2t \u21d214t=300 \u21d2t\u224821.428. Not integer.\n\nRatio 9:2:4 (sum15):\n\na=9t, b=2t, c=4t \u21d215t=300 \u21d2t=20,\n\nThus a=180, b=40, c=80.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=180\u00d740\u00d780=576,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=180\u00d740 +40\u00d780 +180\u00d780=7,200+3,200+14,400=24,800,\n\nThus,\n\n576,000 -2,480,000 +2,000,000=96,000\u22600.\n\nNo.\n\nAnother ratio 10:4:2 (sum16):\n\na=10t, b=4t, c=2t \u21d216t=300 \u21d2t=18.75. Not integer.\n\nThus, I think the only valid ratios are the four non-zero, non-equal ones plus the all-equal and zero cases.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions is 31.\n\nHowever, in my earlier examples, I found (160,100,40) as part of the 8:5:2 ratio, which is one of the four.\n\nSimilarly, (100,75,125) is part of 4:3:5,\n\n(120,100,80) is part of 6:5:4,\n\nand (150,100,50) as part of 3:2:1.\n\nThus, these four ratios each contribute 6 solutions.\n\nTherefore, total is 31.\n\nBut let me confirm using the equation for ratio 6:5:4:\n\na=6t, b=5t, c=4t \u21d215t=300 \u21d2t=20,\n\nThus a=120, b=100, c=80,\n\nThe equation holds, so this is valid.\n\nTherefore, adding 6 permutations for this gives 6 more.\n\nThus, the total is 31.\n\nHowever, the problem specifies nonnegative integers, so zero is allowed. Thus, the zero cases are valid.\n\nWait, but let me see another possible ratio:\n\nRatio 5:5:5 (sum15):\n\na=5t, b=5t, c=5t \u21d215t=300 \u21d2t=20.\n\nThus a=100, b=100, c=100, which is the all-equal case already counted.\n\nThus, no new solutions here.\n\nTherefore, I think the total number of solutions is 31.\n\nBut wait, let me verify with another ratio:\n\nRatio 7:6:2 (sum15):\n\nAs before, it didn't work.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait let me make a table of all possible ratios found:\n\n1. (100,100,100) \u21921.\n\n2. Zeros:\n\n   - (200,100,0) and permutations \u21926.\n\n3. 3:2:1 ratios:\n\n   - (150,100,50) and permutations \u21926.\n\n4. 8:5:2 ratios:\n\n   - (160,100,40) and permutations \u21926.\n\n5. 4:3:5 ratios:\n\n   - (100,75,125) and permutations \u21926.\n\n6. 6:5:4 ratios:\n\n   - (120,100,80) and permutations \u21926.\n\nTotal:1+6+6+6+6+6=31.\n\nThus, the answer should be 31.\n\nHowever, I might have missed a ratio, but given the time invested and the patterns found, I think this is the most plausible count.\n\nWait, but let me check another ratio, say 9:5:6 (sum20):\n\na=9t, b=5t, c=6t \u21d220t=300 \u21d2t=15,\n\nThus a=135, b=75, c=90.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=135\u00d775\u00d790=911,250,\n\nab + bc + ca=135\u00d775 +75\u00d790 +135\u00d790=10,125+6,750+12,150=29,025,\n\nThus,\n\n911,250 -2,902,500 +2,000,000= (911,250+2,000,000) -2,902,500=2,911,250-2,902,500=8,750\u22600.\n\nNo good.\n\nAnother ratio 10:3:7 (sum20):\n\na=10t, b=3t, c=7t \u21d220t=300 \u21d2t=15,\n\nThus a=150, b=45, c=105.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=150\u00d745\u00d7105=708,750,\n\nab + bc + ca=150\u00d745 +45\u00d7105 +150\u00d7105=6,750+4,725+15,750=27,225,\n\nThus,\n\n708,750 -2,722,500 +2,000,000= -13,750\u22600.\n\nNo.\n\nThus, I think the total is 31. But I need to ensure I didn't double-count any solutions.\n\nFor example, is there any overlap between the ratios?\n\n- The all-equal case is unique.\n\n- The zero cases are distinct from others.\n\n- The four non-zero ratios are all distinct and have no overlap in their permutations.\n\nThus, 1+6+24=31.\n\nBut let me see how many solutions there are for each ratio:\n\n- 3:2:1 \u21926,\n\n-8:5:2 \u21926,\n\n-4:3:5 \u21926,\n\n-6:5:4 \u21926,\n\nTotal 24 non-zero, non-equal,\n\nPlus zeros (6),\n\nPlus all-equal (1),\n\nTotal 24+6+1=31.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 31. However, the problem might have intended only the all-equal, zeros, and 3:2:1 ratios, totaling 13, but my exploration shows more.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the ratios like 8:5:2 and 4:3:5, etc., as valid.\n\nWait let me recheck the ratio 8:5:2:\n\na=8t, b=5t, c=2t \u21d215t=300 \u21d2t=20,\n\nThus a=160, b=100, c=40.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=160\u00d7100\u00d740=640,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=160\u00d7100 +100\u00d740 +160\u00d740=16,000+4,000+6,400=26,400,\n\nThus,\n\n640,000 -2,640,000 +2,000,000=0.\n\nYes, correct.\n\nSimilarly, 4:3:5:\n\na=4t, b=3t, c=5t \u21d212t=300 \u21d2t=25,\n\nThus a=100, b=75, c=125,\n\nabc=100\u00d775\u00d7125=937,500,\n\nab + bc + ca=100\u00d775 +75\u00d7125 +100\u00d7125=7,500+9,375+12,500=29,375,\n\nThus,\n\n937,500 -2,937,500 +2,000,000=0. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, 6:5:4:\n\na=6t, b=5t, c=4t \u21d215t=300 \u21d2t=20,\n\nThus a=120, b=100, c=80,\n\nabc=120\u00d7100\u00d780=960,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=120\u00d7100 +100\u00d780 +120\u00d780=12,000+8,000+9,600=29,600,\n\nThus,\n\n960,000 -2,960,000 +2,000,000=0. Correct.\n\nThus, these ratios are valid, so they should be counted.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is 31.\n\nWait, but let me see if there's another ratio like 5:4:3 (sum12):\n\nThis is the same as 4:3:5, so already counted.\n\nRatio 2:3:5 (sum10):\n\na=2t, b=3t, c=5t \u21d210t=300 \u21d2t=30,\n\nThus a=60, b=90, c=150,\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=60\u00d790\u00d7150=810,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=60\u00d790 +90\u00d7150 +60\u00d7150=5,400+13,500+9,000=27,900,\n\nThus,\n\n810,000 -2,790,000 +2,000,000=20,000\u22600. Not valid.\n\nThus, only the four ratios are valid.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is indeed 31.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any other ratios with different sums.\n\nFor example, ratio 7:5:3 (sum15):\n\na=7t, b=5t, c=3t \u21d215t=300 \u21d2t=20,\n\nThus a=140, b=100, c=60.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc=140\u00d7100\u00d760=840,000,\n\nab + bc + ca=140\u00d7100 +100\u00d760 +140\u00d760=14,000+6,000+8,400=28,400,\n\nThus,\n\n840,000 -2,840,000 +2,000,000= (840,000+2,000,000) -2,840,000=2,840,000-2,840,000=0. This works!\n\nThus, this is another valid ratio:7:5:3 (sum15).\n\nThus, this adds another 6 permutations.\n\nThus, now the total increases to 31 +6=37.\n\nWait, this ratio 7:5:3 was not considered before.\n\nLet me confirm this:\n\na=140, b=100, c=60.\n\nCheck the original equation:\n\na\u00b2b +a\u00b2c +b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b,\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b =140\u00b2\u00d7100=19,600\u00d7100=1,960,000,\n\na\u00b2c=140\u00b2\u00d760=19,600\u00d760=1,176,000,\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2\u00d7140=10,000\u00d7140=1,400,000,\n\nb\u00b2c=100\u00b2\u00d760=10,000\u00d760=600,000,\n\nc\u00b2a=60\u00b2\u00d7140=3,600\u00d7140=504,000,\n\nc\u00b2b=60\u00b2\u00d7100=3,600\u00d7100=360,000.\n\nSumming all terms:\n\n1,960,000 +1,176,000 =3,136,000,\n\n+1,400,000 \u21924,536,000,\n\n+600,000 \u21925,136,000,\n\n+504,000 \u21925,640,000,\n\n+360,000 \u21926,000,000. Correct.\n\nThus, ratio 7:5:3 is valid. This adds another 6 permutations.\n\nThus, the total now is:\n\n1 (all equal) +\n\n6 (zeros) +\n\n6 (3:2:1) +\n\n6 (8:5:2) +\n\n6 (4:3:5) +\n\n6 (6:5:4) +\n\n6 (7:5:3) =\n\nTotal:1+6\u00d76=1+36=37.\n\nHmm, so this means there's another ratio. This suggests that my initial approach is missing several ratios, and the problem might have more solutions.\n\nThis indicates that my method of trial and error is error-prone and time-consuming. Perhaps there's a better mathematical approach.\n\nLet me revisit the equation:\n\nWe have a + b + c = 300,\n\nand abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300,\n\nQ = ab + bc + ca,\n\nP = abc.\n\nThen, the equation is P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nWe also know that for three variables, (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),\n\nSo, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2Q = 300\u00b2 - 2Q = 90,000 - 2Q.\n\nBut not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider substituting variables.\n\nLet me set x = a - 100, y = b - 100, z = c - 100. Thus, x + y + z =0,\n\nand we can express the equation in terms of x,y,z.\n\nLet me try that substitution.\n\nLet a =100 +x,\n\nb=100 +y,\n\nc=100 +z,\n\nwith x + y + z =0.\n\nThen,\n\nCompute Q =ab + bc + ca,\n\n= (100+x)(100+y) + (100+y)(100+z) + (100+z)(100+x),\n\nExpand each term:\n\nFirst term:100\u00b2 +100y +100x +xy,\n\nSecond term:100\u00b2 +100z +100y +yz,\n\nThird term:100\u00b2 +100x +100z +zx,\n\nSum all terms:\n\n3\u00d7100\u00b2 +100(y +x +y +z +x +z) + (xy + yz + zx),\n\n=30,000 + 100*(2x + 2y +2z) + (xy + yz + zx),\n\nBut since x + y + z =0, this becomes:\n\n30,000 +100*(2*(x + y + z)) + (xy + yz + zx),\n\n=30,000 +0 + (xy + yz + zx),\n\nThus Q =30,000 + (xy + yz + zx).\n\nSimilarly, compute P = abc = (100+x)(100+y)(100+z).\n\nExpand this:\n\nFirst, (100+x)(100+y) =100\u00b2 +100(y +x) +xy,\n\nMultiply by (100+z):\n\n= [10,000 +100(x + y) +xy]*(100 +z),\n\n=10,000*100 +10,000z +100(x+y)*100 +100(x+y)z +xy*100 +xy z,\n\n=1,000,000 +10,000z +10,000(x + y) +100z(x + y) +100xy +xyz,\n\nCombine terms:\n\n1,000,000 +10,000(z +x + y) +100z(x+y) +100xy +xyz,\n\nBut since x + y + z =0 \u21d2 z = -x -y,\n\nSubstitute z =-x -y,\n\nThus,\n\n1,000,000 +10,000*(-x -y +x + y) [Wait, check terms again]:\n\nWait let me re-express:\n\nThe term 10,000(z +x + y)=10,000*(z +x +y)=10,000*0=0.\n\nThus,\n\nP=1,000,000 +100z(x+y) +100xy +xyz,\n\nNow, z = -x -y,\n\nThus,\n\nP=1,000,000 +100*(-x -y)(x + y) +100xy + (-x -y)xy,\n\nExpand the terms:\n\nFirst term:1,000,000,\n\nSecond term:100*(-x\u00b2 -xy -xy -y\u00b2)=100*(-x\u00b2 -2xy -y\u00b2),\n\nThird term:+100xy,\n\nFourth term:+(-x -y)xy =-x\u00b2y -xy\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nP=1,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -200xy -100y\u00b2 +100xy -x\u00b2y -xy\u00b2,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy -x\u00b2y -xy\u00b2 +1,000,000.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe better to proceed with the equation.\n\nThe given equation is P =100Q -2,000,000,\n\nSubstitute P and Q expressions:\n\n1,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -200xy -100y\u00b2 +100xy -x\u00b2y -xy\u00b2 =100*(30,000 +xy + yz + zx) -2,000,000.\n\nWait, let me re-express the right side:\n\n100Q -2,000,000 =100*(30,000 + (xy + yz + zx)) -2,000,000,\n\n=3,000,000 +100(xy + yz + zx) -2,000,000,\n\n=1,000,000 +100(xy + yz + zx).\n\nThus, the equation becomes:\n\nLeft side (P)=1,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -200xy -100y\u00b2 +100xy -x\u00b2y -xy\u00b2,\n\nRight side=1,000,000 +100(xy + yz + zx),\n\nSubtract right side from left side:\n\n[1,000,000 -100x\u00b2 -200xy -100y\u00b2 +100xy -x\u00b2y -xy\u00b2] - [1,000,000 +100(xy + yz + zx)] =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n-100x\u00b2 -100y\u00b2 -100xy -x\u00b2y -xy\u00b2 -100*(xy + yz + zx)=0.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Perhaps this substitution isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the equation is symmetric and look for integer solutions where variables are multiples of certain numbers.\n\nGiven that in all valid solutions so far, the variables are multiples of 10 or 5, perhaps variables must be multiples of 10.\n\nAssume a=10a', b=10b', c=10c', then a' +b' +c'=30,\n\nThe equation becomes:\n\n10a'*10b'*10c' =100*(10a'*10b' +10b'*10c' +10a'*10c') -2,000,000,\n\nSimplify:\n\n1000a'b'c' =100*(100(ab' +b'c' +a'c')) -2,000,000,\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\n10a'b'c' =100(ab' +b'c' +a'c') -20,000,\n\nThus,\n\n10a'b'c' -100(a'b' +b'c' +a'c') +20,000=0,\n\nDivide by 10:\n\na'b'c' -10(a'b' +b'c' +a'c') +2,000=0.\n\nNow, this equation is simpler. We need to find nonnegative integers a', b', c' with a' + b' + c'=30 satisfying this.\n\nThis might be a more manageable equation.\n\nLet me denote x=a', y=b', z=c', so x+y+z=30,\n\nand xyz -10(xy + yz +zx)+2000=0.\n\nWe need to find all triples (x,y,z) of nonnegative integers summing to 30 that satisfy this equation.\n\nThis might be feasible by iterating possible values.\n\nLet me try possible triples.\n\nFirst, note that if any of x,y,z is zero, say z=0, then the equation becomes:\n\n0 -10(xy +0 +0)+2000= -10xy +2000=0 \u21d2xy=200.\n\nWith x+y=30. Thus,\n\nx*(30-x)=200 \u21d2-x\u00b2+30x -200=0 \u21d2x\u00b2-30x +200=0.\n\nDiscriminant=900-800=100 \u21d2x=(30\u00b110)/2 \u21d220 or10.\n\nThus, (x,y,z)=(20,10,0), (10,20,0), (0,20,10), etc. Thus, these correspond to the zero cases when scaled back (multiply by10) giving (200,100,0) etc., which we already have.\n\nThus, the zero cases are captured here.\n\nNext, consider cases with all variables positive.\n\nLet me consider the case where x,y,z are all multiples of 5, since previous solutions like (150,100,50) correspond to (15,10,5).\n\nLet me suppose x,y,z are multiples of 5. Let x=5p, y=5q, z=5r,\n\nThen p+q+r=6,\n\nEquation becomes:\n\n5p\u00d75q\u00d75r -10*(5p\u00d75q +5q\u00d75r +5p\u00d75r)+2000=0,\n\n125pqr -10*(25(pq +qr +pr)) +2000=0,\n\n125pqr -250(pq + qr +pr)+2000=0,\n\nDivide by 25:\n\n5pqr -10(pq + qr + pr)+80=0,\n\nWhich is the same equation I had before when scaling by 50. Thus solutions include:\n\n- (2,2,2) \u2192p=q=r=2 \u2192x=10,y=10,z=10 \u2192 (100,100,100).\n\n- (1,2,3) \u2192p=1, q=2, r=3 \u2192x=5,y=10,z=15 \u2192 scaled to (50,100,150).\n\n- (1,1,4) \u2192x=5,y=5,z=20 \u2192 gives equation result 10\u22600.\n\nThus, these correspond to the known solutions.\n\nHowever, there are other solutions where variables are not multiples of5.\n\nFor example, the solution (16,10,4) \u2192 scaled from (x,y,z)=(16,10,4) (sum 30):\n\nCheck equation:\n\n16\u00d710\u00d74 -10*(16\u00d710 +10\u00d74 +16\u00d74)+2000,\n\n=640 -10*(160+40+64)+2000,\n\n=640 -10*(264)+2000,\n\n=640 -2640+2000= (640+2000)-2640=2640-2640=0. Works.\n\nThus, (16,10,4) is a solution, which corresponds to the ratio 8:5:2 (16:10:4 =8:5:2).\n\nThus, this method shows that there are more solutions beyond multiples of5.\n\nTo find all solutions, perhaps iterate over possible triples (x,y,z):\n\nGiven the equation xyz -10(xy + yz +zx)+2000=0 and x+y+z=30.\n\nLet me try possible values for x \u2264 y \u2264 z to avoid duplicates.\n\nLet me start with x from1 to10 (since x \u2264 y \u2264 z and x+y+z=30, so x \u226410).\n\nFor each x, find y and z such that y \u2265x, z=30-x-y,\n\nand equation holds.\n\nLet me proceed:\n\nCase x=5:\n\ny ranges from5 to (30-5)/2=12.5 \u21d2 up to12.\n\nCompute for x=5:\n\nEquation:5yz -10(5y + yz +5z)+2000=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n5yz -50y -10yz -50z +2000=0,\n\n-5yz -50y -50z +2000=0,\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n5yz +50y +50z -2000=0,\n\nDivide by5:\n\nyz +10y +10z -400=0,\n\nAdd 100 to both sides:\n\nyz +10y +10z +100=500,\n\nFactor:\n\n(y+10)(z+10)=500,\n\nThus, y+10 and z+10 are positive integers greater than10, factors of500.\n\nWith y \u2264 z,\n\nPossible factor pairs of500 where a \u2264b and a*b=500:\n\n(10,50), (20,25), (25,20) but since a \u2264b, (10\u00d750), (20\u00d725).\n\nThus,\n\nCase1:\n\ny+10=10 \u21d2y=0, but y\u2265x=5 \u21d2invalid.\n\nCase2:\n\ny+10=20 \u21d2y=10,\n\nz+10=25 \u21d2z=15.\n\nThus (x,y,z)=(5,10,15). This corresponds to the 3:2:1 ratio scaled to (15,10,5)*10 \u2192 (150,100,50).\n\nCase3:\n\ny+10=25 \u21d2y=15,\n\nz+10=20 \u21d2z=10,\n\nBut z must be \u2265y \u21d2 invalid as z=10 < y=15.\n\nThus only solution for x=5 is (5,10,15).\n\nNext, x=6:\n\nEquation with x=6:\n\n6yz -10(6y + yz +6z) +2000=0,\n\n6yz -60y -10yz -60z +2000=0,\n\n-4yz -60y -60z +2000=0,\n\nMultiply by-1:\n\n4yz +60y +60z -2000=0,\n\nDivide by4:\n\nyz +15y +15z -500=0,\n\nAdd225:\n\nyz +15y +15z +225=725,\n\nFactor:\n\n(y+15)(z+15)=725.\n\nFactor pairs of725: 1\u00d7725,5\u00d7145,25\u00d729.\n\nPossible pairs where y+15 \u2264 z+15,\n\n(y+15, z+15)= (5,145) \u2192 y= -10 invalid,\n\n(25,29) \u2192 y=10, z=14,\n\n(5\u00d7145=725 but 145 is prime? 145=5\u00d729.\n\nWait, factors are (5\u00d7145), (25\u00d729).\n\nThus,\n\nCase1: y+15=5 \u21d2 y=-10 invalid,\n\nCase2:y+15=25 \u21d2y=10,\n\nz+15=29 \u21d2 z=14,\n\nThus (x,y,z)=(6,10,14).\n\nCheck if y \u2265x \u21d210 \u22656 yes,\n\nz=14 \u226510 yes.\n\nThus solution (6,10,14). Which scales to (60,100,140), but wait, a=6x10=60, b=10\u00d710=100, c=14\u00d710=140.\n\nSum a+b+c=60+100+140=300.\n\nCheck equation:\n\nabc -100(ab+bc+ca)+2,000,000,\n\n=60\u00d7100\u00d7140 -100*(60\u00d7100 +100\u00d7140 +60\u00d7140)+2,000,000,\n\n=840,000 -100*(6,000+14,000+8,400)+2,000,000,\n\n=840,000 -100*28,400 +2,000,000,\n\n=840,000 -2,840,000 +2,000,000=0. Works.\n\nThus this is a valid solution with ratio 6:10:14 simplifies to3:5:7? Wait, 6:10:14=3:5:7.\n\nThus, this is a new ratio 3:5:7 scaled by 2, giving (6,10,14)*10.\n\nThus, this adds another set of permutations (6,10,14) \u2192 (60,100,140) and permutations, totaling 6 solutions.\n\nThus, my previous count was missing this.\n\nContinuing with x=6:\n\nAnother factor pair (29\u00d725):\n\n(y+15=25 \u21d2y=10, z+15=29 \u21d2z=14),\n\nOr (y+15=29 \u21d2y=14, z+15=25 \u21d2z=10),\n\nwhich gives z < y, so only the first.\n\nThus only one solution for x=6.\n\nNext, x=7:\n\nEquation with x=7,\n\n7yz -10(7y + yz +7z) +2000=0",
