      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A number n is called b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the definition. A two-digit number in base b would be of the form n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero. So a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1. The sum of the digits a + c should equal sqrt(n). \n\nSo, putting that together, the equation we need to satisfy is:\n\na + c = sqrt(a*b + c)\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where there are more than 10 such numbers (n). \n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to formalize this. Let me denote the two digits as d1 and d2 (instead of a and c). So, n = d1*b + d2, and d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). Since d1 and d2 are digits in base b, d1 is from 1 to b-1, and d2 is from 0 to b-1. \n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nd1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2\u00b2 = d1*b + d2\n\nLet me rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2\u00b2 - d1*b - d2 = 0\n\nHmm, this equation must hold for integers d1 and d2 in their respective ranges. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since d1 and d2 are digits, perhaps we can express this equation in terms of d1 and d2 and find possible solutions for given b. Let's see.\n\nStarting from the equation:\n\nd1 + d2 = sqrt(n) = sqrt(d1*b + d2)\n\nLet me denote s = d1 + d2, so s = sqrt(d1*b + d2). Then, squaring both sides gives s\u00b2 = d1*b + d2. But since s = d1 + d2, substituting that in, we get:\n\n(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2\n\nWhich is the same equation as before. Let me rearrange terms:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2\u00b2 = d1*b + d2\n\nBring all terms to the left side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2\u00b2 - d1*b - d2 = 0\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other.\n\nLet me try solving for d2 in terms of d1. Let's see:\n\nStarting from the equation:\n\n(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2\n\nLet me expand the left side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2\u00b2 = d1*b + d2\n\nLet me move everything to the left except the terms with d2\u00b2 and d1\u00b2:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2\u00b2 - d1*b - d2 = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps grouping terms:\n\nLet me collect terms in terms of d2:\n\nThe terms with d2\u00b2: 1*d2\u00b2\n\nThe terms with d2: 2*d1*d2 - 1*d2\n\nThe terms with d1: d1\u00b2 - d1*b\n\nSo, altogether:\n\nd2\u00b2 + (2d1 - 1)d2 + (d1\u00b2 - d1*b) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of d2. Let me write it as:\n\nd2\u00b2 + (2d1 -1)d2 + (d1\u00b2 - d1*b) = 0\n\nWe can solve for d2 using the quadratic formula:\n\nd2 = [ - (2d1 -1) \u00b1 sqrt( (2d1 -1)^2 - 4*1*(d1\u00b2 - d1*b) ) ] / 2\n\nLet me compute the discriminant:\n\n\u0394 = (2d1 -1)^2 - 4*(d1\u00b2 - d1*b)\n\nExpanding (2d1 -1)^2: 4d1\u00b2 -4d1 +1\n\nSubtract 4*(d1\u00b2 - d1*b): 4d1\u00b2 -4d1 +1 -4d1\u00b2 +4d1*b\n\nSimplify:\n\n4d1\u00b2 -4d1 +1 -4d1\u00b2 +4d1*b = (-4d1 +1) +4d1*b\n\nFactor terms with d1:\n\n4d1*b -4d1 +1 = 4d1(b -1) +1\n\nSo, the discriminant is 4d1(b -1) +1.\n\nTherefore, the solution for d2 is:\n\nd2 = [ - (2d1 -1) \u00b1 sqrt(4d1(b -1) +1) ] / 2\n\nHmm, since d2 must be an integer between 0 and b-1, the discriminant must be a perfect square, and the numerator must be even so that d2 is integer. Let me note that.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(\u0394) = sqrt(4d1(b-1) +1). Let me call this sqrt term as k, so k must be an integer. Therefore, 4d1(b -1) +1 must be a perfect square. Let me write:\n\n4d1(b -1) +1 = k\u00b2\n\nSo:\n\n4d1(b -1) = k\u00b2 -1 = (k -1)(k +1)\n\nHmm, so 4d1(b -1) factors into two numbers differing by 2. Since 4d1(b-1) is even, and (k-1) and (k+1) are two even numbers or two odd numbers. Since their product is divisible by 4, they must both be even. Because if they were both odd, their product would be 1 mod 4, but 4d1(b-1) is 0 mod 4. So indeed, they must both be even. Therefore, let me set:\n\nLet me let k -1 = 2m and k +1 = 2n, so that (2m)(2n) = 4mn = 4d1(b -1). So,\n\nmn = d1(b -1)\n\nAlso, since k +1 - (k -1) = 2, so 2n -2m = 2 \u21d2 n - m = 1 \u21d2 n = m +1\n\nSo substituting n = m +1 into mn = d1(b -1):\n\nm(m +1) = d1(b -1)\n\nTherefore, m and m +1 are consecutive integers whose product equals d1*(b -1). \n\nTherefore, for given d1, m(m +1) must be equal to d1*(b -1). Since m and m+1 are coprime (consecutive integers), the factors m and m+1 must be factors of d1 and (b -1), but since they are coprime, one of them divides d1 and the other divides (b-1). Alternatively, they could be split between the two. \n\nAlternatively, maybe m and m+1 are factors of d1*(b -1). Since m and m+1 are coprime, each must divide one of the terms. So either:\n\nCase 1: m divides d1 and (m +1) divides (b -1)\n\nOr\n\nCase 2: (m +1) divides d1 and m divides (b -1)\n\nAlternatively, since m and m+1 are coprime, the product m(m+1) divides d1*(b -1). Wait, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me think differently.\n\nSince m(m +1) = d1(b -1), and m and m+1 are coprime, then m must divide d1 or m divides (b -1). Wait, perhaps better to think in terms of possible m and m+1. Since m and m+1 are consecutive integers, their product is m^2 + m. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can approach this by considering that for each d1 from 1 to b-1, we can compute possible m such that m(m+1) = d1(b -1). Then, for each d1, we can see if such an m exists, and then compute k and then d2. \n\nAlternatively, since m and m+1 are factors whose product is d1(b -1), then m and m+1 must be two factors of d1(b -1) differing by 1. Since they are coprime, they must be the two factors that are adjacent (i.e., consecutive integers) and multiply to d1(b -1). \n\nThis seems a bit abstract, maybe I should try plugging in variables to see possible relationships. Alternatively, maybe I can consider that m and m +1 are factors, so m is roughly sqrt(d1(b-1)), since m^2 \u2248 m(m+1) \u2248 d1(b-1). \n\nAlternatively, since m(m +1) = d1(b -1), perhaps for each d1, we can set m = floor(sqrt(d1(b-1))) or something like that, but maybe that's getting too ahead of myself. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of going this route, let's try to express d2 in terms of d1 and b, and see if we can find a relationship. Let me go back to the original equation:\n\n(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nd1*b = (d1 + d2)^2 - d2 = d1\u00b2 + 2d1d2 + d2\u00b2 - d2\n\nTherefore,\n\nd1*b = d1\u00b2 + 2d1d2 + d2\u00b2 - d2\n\nHmm, perhaps factor d1 on the right:\n\nd1*b = d1\u00b2 + d1*(2d2) + d2\u00b2 - d2\n\nWait, perhaps rearrange terms:\n\nd1*b - d1\u00b2 = 2d1d2 + d2\u00b2 - d2\n\nLeft side: d1(b - d1)\n\nRight side: d2(2d1 + d2 -1)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Let me see if I can write this as:\n\nd1*(b - d1) = d2*(2d1 + d2 - 1)\n\nHmm, interesting. Since both sides must be integers, perhaps this equation can be useful. Let me think of d2 in terms of d1 and b. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that since d2 must be between 0 and b-1, and d1 is between 1 and b-1, maybe for a given d1 and b, there is at most one possible d2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe for each possible d1, there can be at most one d2 that satisfies the equation. Let me check with an example.\n\nTake the example given in the problem: 81 is 13-eautiful. So in base 13, 81 is written as 63, so d1=6, d2=3. Then, 6+3=9, and sqrt(81)=9, which checks out. \n\nLet me plug into the equation:\n\nd1 + d2 = sqrt(n) => 6 + 3 = 9 = sqrt(81). The equation (d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2:\n\nLeft side: 9^2 =81, right side: 6*13 +3 =78 +3=81. That works.\n\nSo, in this case, for d1=6 and b=13, d2=3. Let me see if that fits into some of the equations above.\n\nLooking back at m(m+1) = d1(b -1). Here, d1=6, b=13, so 6*(13-1)=6*12=72. So m(m+1)=72. Let's see, m^2 + m -72=0. Solutions: m = [-1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 + 288)]/2 = [-1 \u00b1 sqrt(289)]/2 = [-1 \u00b117]/2. So positive solution is (16)/2=8. So m=8. Then m+1=9. Indeed, 8*9=72. So that works. \n\nThen, k = 2m +1? Wait, because earlier we had k-1=2m, so k=2m+1. Wait, let me check:\n\nEarlier, we set k -1=2m, so k = 2m +1? Let me see:\n\nWait, we had:\n\nLet me recall earlier steps:\n\nWe set k -1 = 2m and k +1 = 2n, so adding these equations: (k -1)+(k +1)=2m +2n \u21d2 2k =2(m +n) \u21d2k = m +n. \n\nBut since n = m +1 (from n - m =1), then k = m + (m +1) = 2m +1. So k = 2m +1. \n\nSo with m=8, k=17. Then, plugging back into the equation for d2:\n\nd2 = [ - (2d1 -1) \u00b1k ] /2\n\nSo with d1=6 and k=17,\n\nd2 = [ - (12 -1) \u00b117 ] /2 = [ -11 \u00b117 ] /2\n\nSo two possibilities:\n\n( -11 +17 ) /2 = 6/2 = 3,\n\nor ( -11 -17 ) /2 = -28/2 = -14.\n\nBut since d2 must be non-negative and less than b, which is 13, we take the positive solution d2=3, which matches the example.\n\nOkay, so that works. So the process is, for a given b and d1, we can compute m(m+1) = d1(b -1). If such an integer m exists, then we can compute k and then d2, and check if d2 is within the required range (0 to b-1).\n\nTherefore, perhaps the way to approach this is for each b, iterate over all possible d1 from 1 to b-1, check if m(m+1) = d1*(b-1) has integer solution m, then compute d2 from that, and if d2 is valid (0 \u2264 d2 < b), then count that as a b-eautiful number. Then, we need to find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a better way to count the number of solutions for each b without iterating through all d1 each time. Let's see.\n\nGiven that m(m +1) = d1(b -1), for each d1, m needs to be an integer such that m and m+1 multiply to d1*(b-1). Since m and m+1 are coprime, each of them must divide d1 or (b-1). Wait, more precisely, since m and m+1 are coprime, then m divides d1*(b-1) and m+1 divides d1*(b-1). But since they are coprime, one divides d1 and the other divides (b-1), or one divides (d1) and the other divides (b-1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since m and m+1 are coprime, their product is m(m+1) = d1*(b -1). Therefore, m divides d1*(b-1), and m+1 divides d1*(b-1). Since m and m+1 are coprime, m divides d1*(b-1) and m+1 divides d1*(b-1). But given their coprimality, m divides (b -1) or m divides d1, and similarly for m+1. \n\nAlternatively, since m and m+1 are coprime, m must divide d1*(b-1), and m+1 must divide d1*(b-1). Since they are coprime, m divides (b-1) or divides d1, and similarly m+1 divides the other. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of m and m+1 as factors of d1*(b-1). Since they are consecutive integers, their prime factors are distinct, so they cannot share any common factors. Therefore, m must divide either d1 or (b-1), and m+1 must divide the other. \n\nThis is getting a bit too abstract. Maybe it's better to consider that for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (d1, d2) such that d1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2). \n\nLet me think of the equation again:\n\n(d1 + d2)^2 = d1*b + d2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to solve for b:\n\nd1*b = (d1 + d2)^2 - d2\n\nSo,\n\nb = [ (d1 + d2)^2 - d2 ] / d1\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\n(d1 + d2)^2 - d2 = d1\u00b2 + 2d1d2 + d2\u00b2 - d2 = d1\u00b2 + 2d1d2 + d2(d2 -1)\n\nThus,\n\nb = [d1\u00b2 + 2d1d2 + d2(d2 -1)] / d1 = d1 + 2d2 + (d2\u00b2 - d2)/d1\n\nHmm, so for b to be integer, the term (d2\u00b2 - d2)/d1 must also be an integer. Therefore, d1 must divide (d2\u00b2 - d2). Since d2 is a digit in base b, which is at least 2, and d2 ranges from 0 to b-1, but since d1 is at least 1, perhaps this can be exploited.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote s = d1 + d2. Since s = sqrt(n), and n = d1*b + d2, then n must be a perfect square, and s must be an integer. Therefore, s is an integer, so the sum of the two digits must be an integer, which is always true since digits are integers, so that's okay.\n\nLet me note that s = d1 + d2 must satisfy s\u00b2 = n = d1*b + d2. \n\nSo, s\u00b2 = d1*b + d2. Since d2 = s - d1, substitute into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d1*b + (s - d1)\n\nRearranged:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = d1*(b -1)\n\nSo,\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the value (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be between 1 and b-1.\n\nSo, this gives a condition on s and b. Let me write that:\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nTherefore, for some integer s, such that 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b -1,\n\nso,\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nWhich implies,\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nHmm, so s\u00b2 - s must be between (b-1) and (b-1)^2. \n\nAlternatively, since s = d1 + d2, and d1 is at least 1, d2 is at least 0, so s is at least 1. Also, since d1 \u2264 b-1 and d2 \u2264 b-1, s = d1 + d2 \u2264 (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. So s can be as large as 2b - 2.\n\nTherefore, s can range from 1 up to 2b -2. \n\nSo, for each b, we can consider possible s values from 1 to 2b-2, and see if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and then check if the resulting d1 is between 1 and b-1, and then check if d2 = s -d1 is between 0 and b-1. \n\nAlternatively, this might be a better approach. Let me formalize this:\n\nFor given b, the possible s must satisfy that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and then d1 is (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Then, once d1 is determined, d2 = s - d1 must also be between 0 and b-1. \n\nTherefore, for each b, we can iterate over possible s where (s\u00b2 - s) mod (b -1) = 0, compute d1 and d2, and check if they are valid digits. \n\nThis seems more systematic. Let me try to find a way to count the number of s for each b such that these conditions hold. \n\nFirst, note that s must satisfy s(s -1) \u2261 0 mod (b -1). So, (b -1) divides s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, (b -1) must divide either s or s -1, or split the factors between them. \n\nAlternatively, since s and s-1 are coprime, the factors of (b -1) must be distributed between s and s-1. So either:\n\nCase 1: (b -1) divides s, and (b -1) divides s, so s must be a multiple of (b -1), but since s and s-1 are coprime, (b -1) can't divide both. Wait, maybe better:\n\nBecause s and s-1 are coprime, so any divisor of (b-1) must divide one of them, but not both. Therefore, (b -1) must be a product of a divisor of s and a divisor of (s -1). Since they are coprime, then (b-1) must be equal to a divisor of s multiplied by a divisor of (s -1). But since s and s-1 are coprime, the factors are separated. \n\nTherefore, perhaps (b -1) can be written as d1*d2, where d1 divides s and d2 divides (s -1). Since d1 and d2 must be coprime. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think that since (b -1) divides s(s -1), then (b -1) must divide either s or s-1, but not necessarily entirely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can rephrase the condition as:\n\nLet me denote k = b -1, so the condition becomes s(s -1) \u22610 mod k, and then d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k must be between 1 and b-1 = k. \n\nSo for each k = b -1 \u22651 (since b \u22652), we need to find all s such that s(s -1) is divisible by k, and then check that d1 = s(s-1)/k is between 1 and k, and then d2 = s - d1 is between 0 and (k+1)-1 = k (since b =k +1). Wait, but d2 must also be less than b = k +1, so d2 \u2264k. Since d2 = s -d1, and s = d1 +d2, so that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to for each k (where k = b -1, starting at 1), find all integers s where s(s -1) divisible by k, and (s\u00b2 - s)/k is between 1 and k, and then d2 = s - (s\u00b2 - s)/k must be between 0 and k. \n\nHmm, perhaps even better to note that since d1 and d2 are digits in base b =k+1, so d2 must be between 0 and k, which is already satisfied because d2 = s - d1, and s is at most 2k (since s = d1 +d2 \u2264k +k =2k). \n\nWait, actually s could be as big as 2k, but let's see:\n\nSince d1 \u2264k and d2 \u2264k, so s =d1 +d2 \u2264k +k=2k, so s can go up to 2k. \n\nTherefore, for each k (starting at 1), the possible s are from 1 to 2k. But even better, perhaps we can parameterize s in terms of multiples related to k. \n\nAlternatively, maybe for each k, the number of s where s(s-1) \u22610 mod k, and then d1=(s\u00b2 -s)/k is between 1 and k, and d2 = s - d1 must be between 0 and k. \n\nAlternatively, since d2 = s - d1 = s - (s\u00b2 - s)/k = [k s - s\u00b2 + s]/k = [ -s\u00b2 + (k +1)s ] /k. Hmm, that might not be helpful.\n\nWait, let's compute d2:\n\nd2 = s - d1 = s - (s\u00b2 - s)/k = (k s - s\u00b2 + s)/k = (-s\u00b2 + (k +1)s)/k.\n\nBut since d2 must be an integer between 0 and k, perhaps that's another condition. \n\nAlternatively, since s(s -1) must be divisible by k, so s(s-1)/k must be integer, so d1 is integer. Then, d2 = s - d1 is also integer.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the steps are:\n\nFor a given k = b -1:\n\n1. For s from 1 to 2k:\n\n   a. Check if s(s -1) mod k ==0.\n\n   b. If yes, compute d1 = s(s-1)/k.\n\n   c. Check if d1 is between 1 and k (since d1 must be a digit, 1 \u2264d1 \u2264k).\n\n   d. Compute d2 = s - d1.\n\n   e. Check if d2 is between 0 and k.\n\n   f. If all conditions met, then this s corresponds to a valid b-eautiful number.\n\n2. Count the number of such s for each k, then find the minimal k+1 (since b =k +1) where the count exceeds 10.\n\nHmm, okay, this seems manageable. The problem is that doing this for each k manually would take time. Maybe we can find a pattern or formula for the number of solutions for a given k.\n\nAlternatively, note that s(s-1) \u22610 mod k implies that either:\n\n- s \u22610 mod k, or\n\n- s \u22611 mod k,\n\nBut that's only if k is a prime? Wait no, in general, if k divides s(s-1), since s and s-1 are coprime, then the factors of k must be partitioned between s and s-1. So if k factors into prime powers, then some subset of the prime factors divides s, and the complementary subset divides s -1. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s modulo k is equal to the number of solutions where s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod (k/d), for each divisor d of k. Hmm, inclusion-exclusion?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of s in 1 to 2k satisfying s(s-1) \u22610 mod k is equal to the number of solutions to s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (k/d) for each divisor d of k. But this is getting into more number theory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of s in [1,2k] where s(s-1) is divisible by k is equal to the number of divisors of k plus something? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, note that s and s-1 must be factors covering the factors of k. Since they are coprime, the primes dividing k must divide either s or s-1. \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of k, such that d divides s and (k/d) divides (s -1), then s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (k/d). \n\nThis is a system of congruences, so by Chinese Remainder Theorem, there is a unique solution modulo k. So for each divisor d of k, there is exactly one solution modulo k to s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (k/d). Therefore, the number of solutions s mod k is equal to the number of divisors d of k. \n\nHowever, since s must be in the range 1 to 2k, the total number of solutions would be roughly twice the number of divisors of k, but adjusted for overlaps. Wait, but modulo k, each solution is unique mod k, so in the interval [1, 2k], each residue mod k is covered twice. Therefore, the total number of solutions would be 2*(number of divisors of k). But need to be careful with s=0 or s=1, etc. \n\nWait, let me think again. Let me suppose that for each divisor d of k, there is a solution s mod k given by the congruence s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (k/d). Since d and k/d are coprime (since d divides k), by Chinese remainder theorem, this has a unique solution modulo k. So for each divisor d of k, there is exactly one residue modulo k where s \u2261 that residue mod k. \n\nTherefore, in the interval [1, k], there is exactly one solution for each divisor d of k. Similarly, in [k+1, 2k], the same residues would repeat. Therefore, in total, in [1, 2k], there are 2*(number of divisors of k) solutions. \n\nHowever, some edge cases may overlap. For example, if the solution for a divisor d is 0 mod k, but s must be at least 1. Wait, s=0 would not be in the range. Similarly, s= k+1 would be equivalent to 1 mod k, but let me see:\n\nWait, actually, the solutions are unique modulo k, so in the interval [1, k], each divisor d gives a unique solution s in [1, k], and in [k+1, 2k], they repeat. So total solutions would be 2 * \u03c4(k), where \u03c4(k) is the number of positive divisors of k. \n\nBut we need to ensure that s is in [1, 2k], which it will be. However, we must also ensure that the corresponding d1 and d2 are within their required ranges. \n\nTherefore, the total possible s values are 2*\u03c4(k), but not all of them will satisfy 1 \u2264d1 \u2264k and 0 \u2264d2 \u2264k. \n\nHmm, so maybe the number of solutions is roughly proportional to \u03c4(k), the number of divisors of k. Since we need the count to exceed 10, we need \u03c4(k) to be around 5 or more? Not sure yet. \n\nAlternatively, let me test with the example given. Let\u2019s take the example where b=13, so k = b-1 =12. The number of divisors \u03c4(12)=6 (divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12). Therefore, according to this, there would be 2*6=12 solutions for s, but in reality, the example has at least 1 solution. Wait, but maybe not all divisors lead to valid d1 and d2. \n\nWait, in the example with k=12 (b=13), let's see how many s actually work.\n\nFirst, the divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. For each divisor d, we get a solution s mod 12. Let me compute s for each d:\n\nFor divisor d=1:\n\nWe need s \u22610 mod 1 (which is always true) and s \u22611 mod 12 (since k/d =12/1=12). So s \u22611 mod 12. So in [1,12], s=1; in [13,24], s=13.\n\nFor d=2:\n\ns \u22610 mod 2 and s\u22611 mod 6 (since k/d=12/2=6). Solve s \u22610 mod2, s\u22611 mod6. Let me see:\n\ns mod6=1, so possible s=1,7 mod12. But also need s\u22610 mod2. Since 1 mod6 is 1 or 7 mod12. 1 mod12 is odd, 7 mod12 is also odd? No: 1 mod6 is either 1 or7 mod12. Wait 1 mod6 is 1,7,13,\u2026 but mod12, 1 mod6 would be 1,7 mod12. Both 1 and 7 mod12 are odd, but s must be even? Since s \u22610 mod2.\n\nWait, s \u22610 mod2 and s \u22611 mod6. Let's solve these:\n\nLet me write s=2m. Then 2m \u22611 mod6 \u21d2 2m\u22611 mod6 \u21d2 m\u2261 (1/2) mod3. But 2^{-1} mod6 is not an integer. Wait, 2m \u22611 mod6 \u21d2 2m \u22611 mod6. But 2 and 6 are not coprime. Since gcd(2,6)=2, so 2 divides 1? No, so no solution? Wait, this is a problem. \n\nHmm, that suggests that for d=2, there is no solution? But that contradicts the earlier logic. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to be more precise. The congruence is s \u22610 mod d (which is 2) and s\u22611 mod (k/d)=6. \n\nLet me write s=2m. Then substitute into s\u22611 mod6: 2m \u22611 mod6 \u21d2 2m \u22611 mod6. But 2m mod6 can be 0,2,4 only, so 1 mod6 is impossible. Therefore, no solution for d=2. \n\nHmm, so my previous assumption that for each divisor there is a solution is not exactly correct, because in some cases, the congruence may not have a solution. \n\nTherefore, my previous reasoning was flawed. Let me check again.\n\nThe system is s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod (k/d). For this to have a solution, the two congruences must be compatible. Since d and k/d are coprime? Wait, since d divides k, then k = d * m, so (k/d)=m. But d and m need not be coprime. Wait, actually, in order for the congruences s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod m (where m=k/d) to have a solution, we must have that 1\u22610 mod gcd(d, m). Since gcd(d, m) divides both d and m=k/d. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote m =k/d. So, gcd(d, m) divides gcd(d, k/d). Let me compute gcd(d, m) where m=k/d. Let g = gcd(d, m). Then g divides d and divides m =k/d, so g divides gcd(d, m)=gcd(d, k/d). Let me write k = d * m, so m =k/d. \n\nWait, perhaps an example will help. For k=12, d=2, m=6. Then gcd(2,6)=2. So the congruence s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod6 requires that s \u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod6. But mod2: s must be 0 mod2, but mod6: s\u22611 mod6 \u21d2 s is odd mod2? Contradiction. So no solution here.\n\nTherefore, in order for the congruence to have a solution, the two congruences must agree on the gcd(d, m). Specifically, the congruence s \u22611 mod m must satisfy s\u22610 mod gcd(d, m). Since s\u22610 mod d implies s\u22610 mod gcd(d, m), and s\u22611 mod m implies s\u22611 mod gcd(d, m). Therefore, 0 \u22611 mod gcd(d, m). Therefore, gcd(d, m) must divide 1. Therefore, gcd(d, m)=1. \n\nTherefore, the congruence s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod m has a solution only if gcd(d, m)=1, where m=k/d. \n\nThus, the condition is that gcd(d, k/d) =1. Therefore, for each divisor d of k with gcd(d, k/d)=1, there exists a solution s mod k. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s mod k is equal to the number of divisors d of k such that gcd(d, k/d)=1. \n\nThis is an important correction. \n\nTherefore, for a given k, the number of solutions modulo k is equal to the number of divisors d of k with gcd(d, k/d)=1. Each such d gives a unique solution mod k. \n\nTherefore, in the interval [1,2k], the number of s would be 2 times that count (since each residue mod k appears twice in 1 to 2k). However, we must check if the solutions are in the range and satisfy the digit conditions. \n\nTherefore, let me formalize this:\n\nThe number of s values for a given k is 2 * N(k), where N(k) is the number of divisors d of k with gcd(d, k/d)=1. \n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the minimal k (starting from 1) such that 2*N(k) >10, i.e., N(k) >5. \n\nWait, but actually, not exactly, because even if there are N(k) solutions mod k, each gives two s in 1 to 2k, but not all of them will lead to valid d1 and d2. \n\nTherefore, we need to be precise here. Let me think again. \n\nFirst, for each divisor d of k with gcd(d, k/d)=1, there is a unique solution s mod k. So in [1,k], there are N(k) solutions. In [k+1, 2k], the same N(k) solutions are repeated. So total of 2*N(k) s values in [1,2k]. \n\nHowever, each of these s must also satisfy that d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k is between 1 and k, and d2 = s - d1 must be between 0 and k. \n\nBut since s is in [1,2k], let's see:\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k. Let me see the possible range of d1. \n\nWhen s=1: d1=(1-1)/k=0, but d1 must be \u22651, so this is invalid.\n\ns=2: (4 -2)/k =2/k. Since k \u22651, but for k \u22652, this would be less than 1, so d1=0.25 for k=8, which is not integer. Wait, but actually, s must satisfy s(s-1) divisible by k, so d1 must be integer.\n\nWait, actually, whenever s is a solution, then s(s-1) is divisible by k, so d1=(s\u00b2 -s)/k must be integer. So d1 is integer. So for s in the valid solutions (those s that satisfy the congruences), d1 is integer.\n\nTherefore, for each solution s, d1 is integer. Now, check if d1 is between 1 and k (since d1 must be 1 to k as a digit in base b=k+1). \n\nSimilarly, d2 =s - d1 must be between 0 and k. \n\nSo let me see for s in [1,2k], and given that s is a solution, whether d1 and d2 are within the required bounds. \n\nFirst, d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k. Let me see what's the maximum value of d1. \n\nSince s can be up to 2k, so s=2k gives d1=(4k\u00b2 -2k)/k =4k -2. Which is way larger than k. \n\nWait, but s is in [1, 2k], but the solutions s may not go up to 2k necessarily. Wait, but the solutions are periodic mod k, so for example, s= k + t where t was a solution in [1,k]. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Maybe it's better to proceed with an example. Let's take k=12 (b=13) as in the problem's example.\n\nFirst, find all divisors d of 12 where gcd(d, 12/d)=1.\n\nDivisors of 12: 1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nCheck each:\n\nd=1: gcd(1, 12/1=12) = gcd(1,12)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2,6)=2 \u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=3: gcd(3,4)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=4: gcd(4,3)=1 \u2192 yes. (Wait, 12/4=3, gcd(4,3)=1)\n\nd=6: gcd(6,2)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=12: gcd(12,1)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the valid d's are 1,3,4,12. So N(k)=4. Therefore, number of s is 2*4=8. But in the problem's example, there is at least one solution (s=9, since 6+3=9, and s= d1 +d2=6+3=9). Let me check s=9.\n\nCompute d1=(81 -9)/12=72/12=6. Yes, that works. d2=9 -6=3, which is valid. \n\nAnother solution for d=1:\n\nd=1: s \u22610 mod1 and s\u22611 mod12. So s\u22611 mod12. So s=1 and 13. \n\nCheck s=1:\n\nd1=(1-1)/12=0 \u2192 invalid since d1 must be \u22651.\n\ns=13:\n\nd1=(169 -13)/12=156/12=13. But d1 must be \u2264k=12. So invalid.\n\nThus, s=1 and 13 give invalid d1.\n\nNext, d=3:\n\ns\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod4 (since k/d=12/3=4).\n\nFind s \u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod4.\n\nLet me solve s=3m \u22611 mod4 \u21d23m\u22611 mod4 \u21d2 m\u22613 mod4 (since 3*3=9\u22611 mod4). So m=4n +3. Thus s=3*(4n +3)=12n +9. The solutions mod12 are s\u22619 mod12. So in [1,12], s=9; in [13,24], s=21.\n\nCheck s=9:\n\nd1=(81-9)/12=72/12=6, which is good. d2=3, valid.\n\ns=21:\n\nd1=(441 -21)/12=420/12=35. But k=12, so d1 must be \u226412. 35>12 invalid.\n\nTherefore, only s=9 is valid here.\n\nNext, d=4:\n\ns\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3 (since k/d=12/4=3).\n\nSo s=4m \u22611 mod3 \u21d24m\u22611 mod3 \u21d2 m\u22611 mod3 (since 4\u22611 mod3). Thus m=3n +1 \u21d2 s=4*(3n +1)=12n +4. So solutions mod12: s\u22614 mod12. Thus in [1,12] s=4, in [13,24] s=16.\n\nCheck s=4:\n\nd1=(16 -4)/12=12/12=1. Valid. d2=4-1=3. So n=1*12 +3=15. Wait, n is the number which is d1*b +d2 =1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4, and 1+3=4. Yes, that works. So s=4 is valid.\n\ns=16:\n\nd1=(256 -16)/12=240/12=20. Which is greater than k=12. Invalid.\n\nNext, d=12:\n\ns\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod1 (since k/d=12/12=1). So s\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod1 (which is always true). So s\u22610 mod12. Thus s=12 and 24 (but 24>2k=24? Since k=12, 2k=24, so s=24 is included). \n\nCheck s=12:\n\nd1=(144 -12)/12=132/12=11. Valid (since \u226412). d2=12 -11=1. So n=11*13 +1=143 +1=144. sqrt(144)=12, and digits 11 and 1 sum to 12. Correct.\n\ns=24:\n\nd1=(576 -24)/12=552/12=46 >12. Invalid.\n\nThus, for d=12, only s=12 is valid.\n\nTherefore, total valid s values are:\n\ns=9 (from d=3), s=4 (d=4), s=12 (d=12), and another from d=?\n\nWait, did I miss any?\n\nWait, N(k)=4, so there should be 4 solutions mod12, but in the valid range (d1 \u226412 and d2 \u22650):\n\nLooking at the valid s values:\n\ns=4 (d=4), s=9 (d=3), s=12 (d=12), and also s=?\n\nWait, d=1's case gave s=9 and 21, but only s=9 was valid (but s=9 was already counted under d=3). Wait, no, s=9 is from d=3. Wait, s=1 (from d=1) was invalid, s=13 also invalid. \n\nWait, is there another?\n\nWait, d=12 gives s=12, which is valid. \n\nWait, so that's three valid s values: 4,9,12. But N(k)=4, so maybe I missed one?\n\nWait, let's check d=1 again:\n\nWait, when d=1: s\u22610 mod1 and s\u22611 mod12 \u21d2 s \u22611 mod12. So in the first 12, s=1, which gives d1=0 invalid, and s=13 in the second interval, which gives d1=13, which is over. So no solutions from d=1. \n\nWait, perhaps the count N(k)=4 includes d=1, but in reality, even though d=1 would give a solution, it doesn't work because d1 is invalid. So perhaps my count is wrong?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the divisor d=1 gives a solution s=1 mod12, but when s=1, d1=0 which is invalid. So even though s is a solution, it doesn't lead to a valid pair (d1, d2). \n\nTherefore, the total valid solutions are only three? But according to the example given, there is at least one (81 is 63 in base13, which is s=9). There might be others. Let's see:\n\nWait, when s=4, which gives n=1*13 +3=16, which is 16, sqrt(16)=4, digits 1 and 3 sum to 4. That works. \n\ns=12 gives n=11*13 +1=144, which works as well. \n\nSo total of 3 valid s values. But according to N(k)=4, but some of the solutions don't work because d1 exceeds k or is too small. \n\nHmm, so my initial approach might overcount because even though s is a solution modulo k, the d1 might be outside the acceptable range. \n\nTherefore, the actual number of valid s is less than 2*N(k). Therefore, perhaps I need to compute for each k, first find all the solutions s in 1 to 2k, then check the d1 and d2 conditions. \n\nThis seems tedious, but maybe manageable for small k. Let's try to find the minimal k where the count exceeds 10. Let's start with small k and see how the count grows.\n\nLet me start with k from 1 upwards:\n\nk=1 (b=2):\n\nN(k): divisors of 1: d=1. Check gcd(1,1)=1. So N(k)=1. So possible s=2*1=2 solutions. Let's check:\n\nDivisors d=1:\n\ns\u22610 mod1 (any s), s\u22611 mod1 \u21d2 any s\u22611 mod1 (which is always true). So s\u22611 mod1 \u21d2 s can be any integer. But modulo 1, everything is 0. Wait, this is getting confusing. Since k=1, the modulus is 1. Let me compute manually.\n\nk=1 (b=2). Then the two-digit numbers in base 2 have d1=1 (since leading digit can't be 0) and d2=0 or1.\n\nSo n=1*2 +d2. The sum of digits s=1 +d2 must equal sqrt(n). \n\nSo:\n\nCase d2=0: s=1. sqrt(n)=sqrt(2). Not integer. Invalid.\n\nd2=1: s=2. sqrt(n)=sqrt(3). Not integer. Invalid.\n\nSo no solutions. Thus count=0.\n\nk=2 (b=3):\n\nDivisors of 2:1,2.\n\nCheck each d:\n\nd=1: gcd(1,2)=1. Valid.\n\nd=2: gcd(2,1)=1. Valid.\n\nSo N(k)=2. So 2*N(k)=4 solutions. Let's check each:\n\nd=1:\n\ns\u22610 mod1 (any s), s\u22611 mod2. So s\u22611 mod2. So s=1,3 in [1,4].\n\nCheck s=1:\n\nd1=(1 -1)/2=0 invalid.\n\ns=3:\n\nd1=(9 -3)/2=6/2=3. Since k=2 (so b=3), d1 must be \u22642. 3>2 invalid. \n\nd=2:\n\ns\u22610 mod2, s\u22611 mod1 (since 2/2=1). So s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod1 (always true). So s\u22610 mod2 \u21d2 s=2,4.\n\ns=2:\n\nd1=(4 -2)/2=1. Valid. d2=2-1=1. Check n=1*3 +1=4. sqrt(4)=2, digits 1+1=2. Valid.\n\ns=4:\n\nd1=(16-4)/2=12/2=6>2. Invalid.\n\nThus valid s=2. So total valid solutions:1 (only s=2). \n\nThus count=1.\n\nk=3 (b=4):\n\nDivisors of 3:1,3.\n\nCheck d=1: gcd(1,3)=1 yes.\n\nd=3:gcd(3,1)=1 yes.\n\nThus N(k)=2, so 4 solutions.\n\nCompute:\n\nd=1:\n\ns\u22610 mod1 (any), s\u22611 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod3. So s=1,4,7,10 in [1,6] and [7,12]? Wait, k=3, so 2k=6. So s in [1,6].\n\nWait s in 1 to 6.\n\ns\u22611 mod3 \u21d2 s=1,4.\n\nCheck s=1:\n\nd1=(1-1)/3=0 invalid.\n\ns=4:\n\nd1=(16-4)/3=12/3=4. But k=3, d1 must be \u22643. 4>3 invalid.\n\nd=3:\n\ns\u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod1 \u21d2 any s\u22610 mod3. So s=3,6.\n\ns=3:\n\nd1=(9-3)/3=6/3=2. Valid. d2=3-2=1. n=2*4+1=9. sqrt(9)=3. 2+1=3. Works.\n\ns=6:\n\nd1=(36-6)/3=30/3=10>3 invalid.\n\nThus valid s=3. Total count=1.\n\nSo k=3 gives 1 solution.\n\nk=4 (b=5):\n\nDivisors of 4:1,2,4.\n\nCheck each d:\n\nd=1: gcd(1,4)=1 yes.\n\nd=2:gcd(2,2)=2 no.\n\nd=4:gcd(4,1)=1 yes.\n\nThus N(k)=2. So 4 solutions.\n\nCompute:\n\nd=1:\n\ns\u22610 mod1 (any), s\u22611 mod4 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod4. s=1,5 in [1,8] (since 2k=8).\n\nCheck s=1: d1=0 invalid.\n\ns=5:\n\nd1=(25-5)/4=20/4=5>k=4. Invalid.\n\nd=4:\n\ns\u22610 mod4, s\u22611 mod1 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod4. s=4,8.\n\ns=4:\n\nd1=(16-4)/4=12/4=3 \u22644. Valid. d2=4-3=1. n=3*5+1=16. sqrt(16)=4. 3+1=4.

Wait, 1*13+3=16, which is correct).\n\nSo total 3 solutions. But the example says 81 is one, so that's counted.

Need higher k.\n\nPerhaps k=24 gives 3, but maybe k=60?\n\nAlternatively, let's think of when N(k) is large enough.\n\nWait, N(k) is the number of divisors d of k with gcd(d, k/d)=1. To have N(k) large, k must have many such divisors.\n\nFor example, if k is a product of two primes, say p and q, then divisors are 1,p,q,pq. Check which have gcd(d, k/d)=1.\n\nFor example, k=6=2\u00d73:\n\nDivisors d=1,2,3,6.\n\nCheck:\n\nd=1:gcd(1,6)=1 yes.\n\nd=2:gcd(2,3)=1 yes.\n\nd=3:gcd(3,2)=1 yes.\n\nd=6:gcd(6,1)=1 yes.\n\nWait, so for k=6, N(k)=4, which we saw earlier gives count=3 (but with some invalid d1/d2). Hmm.\n\nWait, but in k=6 (b=7), we had 3 valid solutions. But N(k)=4.\n\nAlternatively, primes:\n\nTake k= product of two distinct primes p and q.\n\nThen divisors d:1,p,q,pq.\n\nFor each:\n\nd=1:gcd(1, pq)=1 yes.\n\nd=p:gcd(p, q)=1 yes (since p and q are primes).\n\nd=q:gcd(q, p)=1 yes.\n\nd=pq:gcd(pq,1)=1 yes.\n\nThus N(k)=4. So for such k, N(k)=4.\n\nSimilarly, if k is a prime power, say p^m, then the number of valid d's may be less.\n\nWait, let's take k=30=2\u00d73\u00d75. Then divisors d where gcd(d,30/d)=1.\n\nDivisors of 30:1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.\n\nCheck each:\n\nd=1:gcd(1,30)=1 yes.\n\nd=2:gcd(2,15)=1? 2 and15 are coprime? gcd(2,15)=1 yes.\n\nWait, gcd(2,30/2=15)=1 yes.\n\nd=3:gcd(3,10)=1 yes.\n\nd=5:gcd(5,6)=1 yes.\n\nd=6:gcd(6,5)=1? gcd(6,5)=1 yes.\n\nWait, gcd(6,5)=1, so yes.\n\nWait, 30/6=5. gcd(6,5)=1 yes.\n\nd=10:gcd(10,3)=1? gcd(10,3)=1 yes.\n\nYes, gcd(10,3)=1.\n\nd=15:gcd(15,2)=1 yes.\n\nd=30:gcd(30,1)=1 yes.\n\nSo all divisors of 30 satisfy gcd(d, 30/d)=1. Thus N(k)=8. Thus for k=30 (b=31), we have N(k)=8 \u21d2 16 solutions. So potentially many valid s.\n\nLet me compute it:\n\nk=30 (b=31). Let's see how many valid solutions.\n\nFirst, the divisors d=1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, let me check d=20:\n\ns\u22610 mod20, so s=40,100. s=40 is valid, s=100 is over. \n\nAnother divisor was d=20. \n\nHmm, so total of 7 solutions for k=60 (b=61). Still below 10.\n\nHmm, need to go higher. Maybe k=105 (b=106). Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, perhaps k= 240 (b=241), but this might take too long. Maybe try k= 84 (b=85):\n\nk=84=2^2\u00d73\u00d77.\n\nDivisors where gcd(d,84/d)=1.\n\nThe valid divisors d:\n\nMust have d and 84/d coprime.\n\nThis requires that d contains all prime factors of 84 or none. Since 84=2\u00b2\u00d73\u00d77.\n\nSo for gcd(d,84/d)=1, the prime factors of d and 84/d must be disjoint. So d must be a product of some subset of the primes, and 84/d must be the complementary subset. Since the primes are 2,3,7.\n\nThus possible d's are:\n\n- d=1 (nothing, the other is 84)\n\n- d=3 (then 84/d=28=2\u00b2\u00d77. gcd(3,28)=1 yes.\n\n- d=7 (84/7=12. gcd(7,12)=1 yes.\n\n- d=3\u00d77=21 (84/21=4. gcd(21,4)=1 yes.\n\n- d=2\u00b2=4 (84/4=21. gcd(4,21)=1 yes.\n\n- d=2\u00b2\u00d73=12 (84/12=7. gcd(12,7)=1 yes.\n\n- d=2\u00b2\u00d77=28 (84/28=3. gcd(28,3)=1 yes.\n\n- d=2\u00b2\u00d73\u00d77=84 (84/84=1. gcd(84,1)=1 yes.\n\nAdditionally, other divisors like d=2 (then 84/2=42, gcd(2,42)=2 no), d=6 (gcd(6,14)=2 no), etc.\n\nThus the valid d's are:\n\n1,3,4,7,12,21,28,84. So N(k)=8 \u21d2 16 solutions.\n\nThis may give more valid s.\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming. Perhaps there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, notice that when k is a product of distinct primes, like k= p*q*r, then the number of valid divisors increases.\n\nAlternatively, note that the count of valid s is roughly proportional to N(k). So to get over 10, we need N(k)>=6, so that 2*N(k)>=12.\n\nLooking for k with N(k)>=6.\n\nLet me see:\n\nLooking back, when k=30, N(k)=8, which gives 7 solutions. \n\nk=60 gave 7 solutions.\n\nk= 240? Maybe it's better to see what k= 105 gives (product of three primes:3\u00d75\u00d77):\n\nk=105=3\u00d75\u00d77.\n\nDivisors d where gcd(d,105/d)=1.\n\nPossible d's:\n\nMust be subsets of the prime factors. For example:\n\nd=1,3,5,7,15,21,35,105.\n\nCheck each:\n\nd=1: gcd(1,105)=1 yes.\n\nd=3:gcd(3,35)=1 yes.\n\nd=5:gcd(5,21)=1 yes.\n\nd=7:gcd(7,15)=1 yes.\n\nd=15:gcd(15,7)=1 yes (gcd(15,7)=1).\n\nWait, 105/15=7. gcd(15,7)=1 yes.\n\nd=21:gcd(21,5)=1 yes.\n\nd=35:gcd(35,3)=1 yes.\n\nd=105:gcd(105,1)=1 yes.\n\nThus N(k)=8 \u21d2 16 solutions. So potentially 8 valid s.\n\nBut maybe more. Let me compute for k=105 (b=106):\n\nBut this is time-consuming, but perhaps the count is increasing.\n\nAlternatively, let me see k= 210=2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77.\n\nDivisors d where gcd(d,210/d)=1.\n\nThese are subsets of the prime factors. Since 210=2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77.\n\nSo divisors d must be products of some subset of the primes, and 210/d must be the complement. Thus:\n\nPossible d's are all subsets of the primes:\n\n1,\n\n2,\n\n3,\n\n5,\n\n7,\n\n2\u00d73=6,\n\n2\u00d75=10,\n\n2\u00d77=14,\n\n3\u00d75=15,\n\n3\u00d77=21,\n\n5\u00d77=35,\n\n2\u00d73\u00d75=30,\n\n2\u00d73\u00d77=42,\n\n2\u00d75\u00d77=70,\n\n3\u00d75\u00d77=105,\n\n2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210.\n\nNow check gcd(d,210/d)=1:\n\nFor each d:\n\nd=1: yes.\n\nd=2:gcd(2,105)=1? gcd(2,105)=1? 2 and105 are coprime yes.\n\nWait, 210/2=105. gcd(2,105)=1 yes.\n\nd=3:gcd(3,70)=1? 3 and70 gcd=1 yes.\n\nd=5:gcd(5,42)=1 yes.\n\nd=7:gcd(7,30)=1 yes.\n\nd=6:gcd(6,35)=1 yes (6=2\u00d73, 35=5\u00d77; coprime).\n\nd=10:gcd(10,21)=1 yes (10=2\u00d75,21=3\u00d77).\n\nd=14:gcd(14,15)=1 yes (14=2\u00d77,15=3\u00d75).\n\nd=15:gcd(15,14)=1 yes.\n\nd=21:gcd(21,10)=1 yes.\n\nd=35:gcd(35,6)=1 yes.\n\nd=30:gcd(30,7)=1 yes.\n\nd=42:gcd(42,5)=1 yes.\n\nd=70:gcd(70,3)=1 yes.\n\nd=105:gcd(105,2)=1 yes.\n\nd=210:gcd(210,1)=1 yes.\n\nThus N(k)=16 divisors. Thus total solutions 32. But most may be invalid.\n\nHowever, likely the count of valid s would be higher. For example, each divisor d gives a solution s mod210. \n\nBut this is getting too complex. Perhaps the minimal b is 13? Wait, no. \n\nWait, let me think of k= 24 (b=25) had 3 solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps k= 60 (b=61) had 7 solutions.\n\nk=105 (b=106) would have more.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider when N(k)=10\uff0cthen the total solutions would be 20, but many might be invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 241 (k=240). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires going up to k= 24, but let me see.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the example is for b=13 (k=12), which had 3 solutions. The user is asking for when there are more than ten such numbers. \n\nLooking back, when I calculated k=30 (b=31), we had 7 solutions. \n\nk=60 (b=61):7.\n\nk= 84 (b=85): maybe more.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating k=30. Let me check again:\n\nFor k=30 (b=31):\n\nValid s values:\n\n16 (d=2),\n\n21 (d=3),\n\n25 (d=5),\n\n6 (d=6),\n\n10 (d=10),\n\n15 (d=15),\n\n30 (d=30).\n\nThat's 7.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to find when N(k) is large enough so that even with losing half of them due to d1> k, the count exceeds 10.\n\nSuppose N(k)=20, then maybe 10 valid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 21 (k=20), but that had 3.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a smarter way. Let me think of the equation:\n\nWe have s = d1 + d2,\n\nand s^2 = n = d1*b + d2.\n\nSo substituting d2 = s -d1,\n\ns\u00b2 = d1*b + s -d1 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s = d1*(b -1).\n\nHence, d1=(s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1).\n\nSince d1 must be between 1 and b-1,\n\nthen 1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1) \u2264 b-1.\n\nThus,\n\nb-1 \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b-1)^2.\n\nLet me denote m = b-1,\n\nthen,\n\nm \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 - s \u2265m,\n\nand s\u00b2 - s \u2264 m\u00b2.\n\nSo, s is between roughly sqrt(m) and m+1.\n\nBut also, s is the sum of two digits in base b, so s \u2264 (b-1)+(b-1)=2b-2=2(m+1)-2=2m.\n\nTherefore, s is between sqrt(m) and 2m.\n\nBut this might not help much.\n\nAlternatively, the equation s\u00b2 - s = m*d1, where m =b-1,\n\nand d1 between1 and m.\n\nThus, for each s between sqrt(m) and 2m,\n\nwe can check if s\u00b2 -s is divisible by m,\n\nand then see if d1=(s\u00b2 -s)/m is between1 and m,\n\nand d2 = s -d1 is between0 and m.\n\nThus, for each m, the number of s between 1 and 2m that satisfy s(s-1) divisible by m,\n\nand then check the digits.\n\nAlternatively, note that the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m which are coprime to their complement.\n\nBut it's still tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 25 (k=24):\n\nWait, k=24, N(k)=4, so 8 solutions.\n\nWait, let's compute for k=24 (b=25):\n\nDivisors of 24:\n\n1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24.\n\nCheck which have gcd(d,24/d)=1:\n\nd=1:gcd(1,24)=1 yes.\n\nd=2:gcd(2,12)=2 no.\n\nd=3:gcd(3,8)=1 yes.\n\nd=4:gcd(4,6)=2 no.\n\nd=6:gcd(6,4)=2 no.\n\nd=8:gcd(8,3)=1 yes.\n\nd=12:gcd(12,2)=2 no.\n\nd=24:gcd(24,1)=1 yes.\n\nThus N(k)=4 \u21d2 8 solutions.\n\nCompute:\n\nd=1:\n\ns\u22611 mod24 \u21d2 s=1,25,\u2026 up to 48.\n\nMost invalid.\n\nd=3:\n\ns\u22610 mod3 and\u22611 mod8 (24/3=8).\n\nSolution s=24n+9 mod24 \u21d2 s=9,33.\n\ns=9:\n\nd1=(81-9)/24=72/24=3 \u226424. d2=6. n=3\u00d725+6=81. sqrt(81)=9. 3+6=9. Good.\n\ns=33:\n\nd1=(1089-33)/24=1056/24=44>24 invalid.\n\nd=8:\n\ns\u22610 mod8 and\u22611 mod3 (24/8=3).\n\nSolution s=24n+16 mod24 \u21d2 s=16,40.\n\ns=16:\n\nd1=(256-16)/24=240/24=10. d2=6. n=10\u00d725+6=256. sqrt(256)=16. 10+6=16. Good.\n\ns=40:\n\nd1=(1600-40)/24=1560/24=65>24 invalid.\n\nd=24:\n\ns\u22610 mod24 \u21d2 s=24,48.\n\ns=24:\n\nd1=(576-24)/24=552/24=23 \u226424. d2=1. n=23\u00d725+1=576. sqrt(576)=24. 23+1=24. Good.\n\ns=48:\n\nd1=(2304-48)/24=2256/24=94>24 invalid.\n\nThus valid s=9,16,24. Count=3.\n\nStill low.\n\nHmm, maybe k= 120 (b=121):\n\nDivisors:\n\nk=120=2^3\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nValid divisors d with gcd(d,120/d)=1.\n\nSuch d must be products of subsets of primes 2,3,5.\n\nThus d can be 1,3,5,15,8, etc.\n\nWait, need to compute.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 21 (k=20), but only had 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121 (k=120).\n\nBut this is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, let me look for k where N(k)=12. For that, k must be a product of 4 distinct primes, then the number of such divisors is 2^4=16? Maybe.\n\nWait, if k is product of 4 distinct primes p1,p2,p3,p4, then divisors d which are products of any subset of the primes, and their complement also is a subset of the primes.\n\nThus, any divisor composed of a subset of the primes. So total divisors are 2^4=16. Each divisor d will have gcd(d, k/d)=1 since they are subsets of primes.\n\nTherefore, N(k)=16.\n\nThus, for such k, we get 32 solutions, possibly many valid.\n\nFor example, let me choose k=2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210 (primes 2,3,5,7). Then N(k)=16 \u21d232 solutions. \n\nCompute for k=210 (b=211):\n\nBut this requires a lot of computation. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 210+1=211, but I need to find the smallest such b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 25 (k=24), but no.\n\nAlternatively, let me try k= 120 (b=121):\n\nk=120=2^3\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nTo find divisors d where gcd(d,120/d)=1.\n\nSuch d must be composed of a subset of the primes, but since there are exponents in 2^3, we have to ensure d contains all factors of 2 or none.\n\nWait, since 2 is present in 2^3, to have gcd(d,120/d)=1, d must not share any prime factors with 120/d.\n\nThus, for example, if d contains 2, then 120/d cannot contain 2, but since d contains 2, 120/d can't have 2, but 120 has 2^3. So to have gcd(d,120/d)=1, d must be a subset of {3,5} or {2^3}, etc.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 31 (k=30) which had 7 solutions. Not enough.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a pattern where for k= m(m+1), the number of solutions increases.\n\nWait, let me think of when s = m+1 and s^2 -s = m(m+1).\n\nWait, s= m+1:\n\nThen s\u00b2 -s = (m+1)^2 - (m+1) = (m+1)(m+1 -1)=m(m+1). So d1=(m(m+1))/m =m+1. But d1 must be \u2264k=m+1. So d1=m+1, which is allowed. d2= s -d1 = (m+1) - (m+1)=0. \n\nThus, this gives a solution: s=m+1, d1=m+1, d2=0. Since d2=0 is allowed (digit can be 0). Thus this is a valid solution for any m. Thus for any k=m+1? Wait, no, because s must be \u22642k=2(m+1). Here s=m+1 \u22642(m+1). So yes.\n\nSo for any k=m, then if k = m, then s= k+1 gives a valid solution:\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nWait, in terms of k = b-1:\n\nIf we set m =k, then s =k+1, then:\n\nd1=(s\u00b2 -s)/k = ( (k+1)^2 - (k+1) )/k = (k^2 +2k +1 -k -1)/k = (k^2 +k)/k =k+1.\n\nBut d1 must be \u2264k. So d1=k+1 is invalid. Wait, that's a problem. \n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me re-do:\n\ns =k+1,\n\nthen s\u00b2 - s = (k+1)^2 - (k+1) =k^2 +2k +1 -k -1 =k^2 +k.\n\nThus d1=(k^2 +k)/k =k +1.\n\nWhich exceeds k, so invalid.\n\nThus this approach doesn't work.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when s =k, then:\n\nd1=(k\u00b2 -k)/k =k-1 \u2264k, valid.\n\nd2= k - (k-1)=1.\n\nThus n= (k-1)* (k+1) +1 =k\u00b2 -1 +1 =k\u00b2.\n\nThus sqrt(n)=k. And digits are (k-1 and1), sum k. This is valid.\n\nThus for any k, s=k gives a valid solution.\n\nThus this is a valid solution for any k. So count at least 1.\n\nIn addition to other solutions.\n\nFor example, in k=30 (b=31):\n\ns=30:\n\nd1=(900-30)/30=870/30=29. d2=1. n=29*31+1=900. sqrt(30). Valid.\n\nThus this is the solution counted in previous calculations.\n\nThus for any k, there is at least one solution s=k.\n\nAnother solution is s= 1? No, s=1 gives d1=0.\n\nWait, so for each k, there are at least one solution (s=k). \n\nAdditionally, other solutions from other divisors.\n\nTherefore, the minimal k where total count exceeds 10 is when N(k) plus other terms reaches over 10.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLet me think of k= 24 (b=25) gave 3 solutions. \n\nk= 30 (b=31) gave 7.\n\nk= 60 (b=61) gave 7.\n\nk= 120 (b=121) ?\n\nAlternatively, let me try k= 48 (b=49):\n\nk=48=16\u00d73.\n\nDivisors d with gcd(d,48/d)=1.\n\n48=2^4\u00d73.\n\nThus, divisors d that are products of subsets of {2,3}, but to have gcd(d,48/d)=1.\n\nThus:\n\nd can be 1 (complement 48, gcd=1),\n\n3 (complement 16, gcd(3,16)=1),\n\n16 (complement 3, gcd=1),\n\n48 (complement1, gcd=1).\n\nAdditionally, d= 2^4=16 and 3.\n\nWait:\n\nAny other divisors?\n\nWait, d= 2^0\u00d73^1=3,\n\nd=2^4\u00d73^0=16,\n\nd=1,\n\nd=48.\n\nThus N(k)=4 \u21d2 8 solutions.\n\nCompute:\n\nd=1:\n\ns\u22611 mod48 \u21d2 s=1,49,\u2026 mostly invalid.\n\nd=3:\n\ns\u22610 mod3 and\u22611 mod16 (48/3=16).\n\nSolve s=3m\u22611 mod16 \u21d23m\u22611 mod16 \u21d2 m\u2261 11 mod16 (3\u00d711=33\u22611 mod16).

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A b-eautiful number is a positive integer n that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A two-digit number in base b would be written as \"ab\" where a is the first digit (the higher place value) and b is the second digit. Wait, actually, in base b, the digits are from 0 to b-1, and the first digit can't be zero. So, a two-digit number in base b can be represented as n = a*b + c, where a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1. The problem states that the sum of the two digits (a + c) should equal the square root of n. So the equation we need is:\n\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nBut n is equal to a*b + c. Therefore, substituting n into the equation:\n\na + c = sqrt(a*b + c)\n\nHmm, so we can square both sides to eliminate the square root, right?\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nLet me write that equation out:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nExpanding the left-hand side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nLet me rearrange the equation to collect like terms:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps we can rearrange terms to group terms with a and terms with c:\n\na\u00b2 + (2c - b)*a + (c\u00b2 - c) = 0\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the best way. Alternatively, let's subtract a*b and c from both sides:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe express this as:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nThen, moving all terms to the left:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe factor some terms?\n\nLet me think of another approach. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, its value is between b^1 (since the first digit is at least 1) and b^2 - 1 (since the second digit is at most b-1). So n is between b and b\u00b2 - 1. Therefore, the square root of n must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) is just less than b, the square root of n is between sqrt(b) and less than b.\n\nMoreover, the square root of n is equal to a + c, where a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1. So the sum a + c must be an integer because a and c are integers, and sqrt(n) must also be an integer because the left side (a + c) is an integer, so n must be a perfect square.\n\nAh, right! So n must be a perfect square. Therefore, sqrt(n) is an integer, so a + c must equal that integer. Let me note that.\n\nSo, steps to solve:\n\n1. For each base b starting from 2 upwards, we need to count how many two-digit numbers in base b (i.e., numbers from b to b\u00b2 - 1) are perfect squares, and for which the sum of their digits (in base b) equals the square root of the number. \n\n2. The problem is to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nSo, perhaps the strategy is to express the problem in terms of variables a and c, then find for each b the possible pairs (a,c) that satisfy the equation (a + c)^2 = a*b + c, with a in [1, b-1] and c in [0, b-1].\n\nAlternatively, since (a + c)^2 = a*b + c, perhaps we can rearrange this equation to express b in terms of a and c:\n\nStarting with (a + c)^2 = a*b + c,\n\nthen:\n\na*b = (a + c)^2 - c\n\nTherefore,\n\nb = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a\n\nSo, b must equal that expression. Since b has to be an integer greater than or equal to 2, and a and c must satisfy the digit constraints (1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1, 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b -1), perhaps for given a and c, we can compute b and check if the constraints are satisfied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible a and c, compute b as [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a, and check if this results in an integer b \u2265 2, and also check that a \u2264 b -1 and c \u2264 b -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parameterize this equation for each possible a and c, and find all possible (a,c,b) triples that satisfy the equation and constraints, and then count the number of such n per b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can model this as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote s = a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = s^2. Since n = a*b + c, substituting gives s^2 = a*b + c. But since s = a + c, we can write c = s - a. Substitute that into the equation:\n\ns^2 = a*b + (s - a)\n\nTherefore:\n\ns^2 = a*b + s - a\n\nRearranged:\n\ns^2 - s = a*b - a\n\nFactor the right side:\n\ns(s - 1) = a*(b - 1)\n\nSo we have s(s - 1) = a*(b - 1)\n\nInteresting. So that equation must hold for integers a and s, given that a is between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a must be between 0 and b -1. Also, s must be an integer since sqrt(n) is an integer, so n is a perfect square.\n\nTherefore, given that s(s - 1) must be divisible by a (since a divides the left-hand side), so a divides s(s - 1). Also, since a is between 1 and b -1, and b = ?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom the equation s(s -1) = a*(b -1), so (b - 1) = [s(s -1)] / a. Since b must be an integer, then [s(s -1)] must be divisible by a. So for each s and a such that a divides s(s -1), then (b -1) would be equal to [s(s -1)] / a, so b = [s(s -1)/a] +1. Then, to get valid b, the a must be a divisor of s(s-1), and then b is determined. Then, we can check the constraints on a and c. \n\nMoreover, since c = s - a, then c must be between 0 and b -1. Since c can't be negative, s -a \u22650, so a \u2264 s. Also, c = s -a must be less than b, which is [s(s-1)/a]+1. Wait, let's see.\n\nBut perhaps the steps can be structured as follows:\n\nFor each possible s (since s is the square root of n, s must be an integer, and n is a two-digit number in base b, so n = s\u00b2 is between b and b\u00b2 -1. So s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s < b, because n < b\u00b2. Therefore, s can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1. But since s must be at least 2 (since n is at least b \u2265 2, so sqrt(n) \u2265 sqrt(2) \u22481.414, but n must be a perfect square, so the minimal s is 2, so s starts at 2.\n\nWait, actually, n can be as small as b (when a=1 and c=0). So sqrt(b) must be less than or equal to s. Therefore, s must be at least the ceiling of sqrt(b). But since s is an integer, s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)). \n\nHowever, since we are trying to find for each b, the number of s that satisfy the conditions, perhaps a better way is to consider possible values of s and a, then compute b from them, then check if the constraints hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to fix b and find all possible s and a that satisfy the equation s(s -1) = a*(b -1), with the constraints on a and c (digits in base b).\n\nLet me see. Let's fix a base b. Then, to find all b-eautiful numbers, we can iterate through possible s (sqrt(n) = s) such that s^2 is a two-digit number in base b (i.e., b \u2264 s\u00b2 < b\u00b2). So s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s < b. Since s is an integer, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.\n\nFor each such s, we can find possible a and c such that a + c = s, and n = a*b + c = s\u00b2. Since c = s - a, substituting into n's equation: a*b + (s -a) = s\u00b2. \n\nThis simplifies to (b -1)*a + s = s\u00b2, so (b -1)*a = s\u00b2 - s, so a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). \n\nTherefore, a must be an integer, so (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1). \n\nMoreover, since a is a digit in base b, it must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1. Similarly, c = s - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b -1. So c = s - a must also be between 0 and b-1.\n\nTherefore, given s and b, a is (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Let me write that as:\n\na = [s(s -1)] / (b -1)\n\nThen, since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, we can write constraints:\n\n1 \u2264 [s(s -1)] / (b -1) \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, the numerator s(s -1) must be divisible by (b -1).\n\nSecond, [s(s -1)] / (b -1) must be between 1 and b -1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, we can consider s from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, and check for each s whether (b-1) divides s(s-1). If yes, then compute a = s(s-1)/(b-1). Then check if a is between 1 and b-1, and then check that c = s - a is between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, since c = s - a, substituting a gives c = s - [s(s -1)/(b -1)]. Let's see if that is okay. \n\nAlternatively, since c must be non-negative, so s - a \u22650 \u2192 a \u2264 s. Since a = s(s-1)/(b-1), then:\n\ns(s-1)/(b-1) \u2264 s \u2192 (s-1)/(b-1) \u22641 \u2192 s -1 \u2264 b -1 \u2192 s \u2264 b. Which is true since s < b, so that holds.\n\nAlso, c = s - a must be less than b. So:\n\ns - a < b \u2192 s - [s(s -1)/(b -1)] < b.\n\nHmm, that inequality might be a bit more involved, but perhaps since a is between 1 and b-1, then c = s -a must be between s - (b -1) and s -1. Since s can be up to b-1, then c can be as low as s - (b-1). However, since s can be as small as, say sqrt(b), which is at least 2, so maybe the lower bound is okay. But maybe as long as a is between 1 and b-1, and c is s -a, then c will automatically be between 0 and b-1?\n\nWait, let's see. Since a is between 1 and b-1, then since c = s - a, and s can be up to b-1:\n\nThe maximum c would be s -1, and since s \u2264 b-1, then c \u2264 (b-1) -1 = b-2, which is less than b-1. The minimum c is s - (b-1). Since s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)), but s can be as small as, say, 2. For example, if s=2, then c = 2 - a. Since a must be at least 1, so c would be at most 1, but since a can be up to b-1, then if a = b-1, c = 2 - (b-1) = 3 - b, which would be negative if b>3. But that would violate the digit constraint.\n\nTherefore, the key is that c must also be non-negative, so s - a \u22650 \u2192 a \u2264 s.\n\nTherefore, in addition to the conditions that a is between 1 and b-1, we must also have a \u2264 s. \n\nTherefore, given a, to have a valid c, need a \u2264 s.\n\nSo putting all together, for each b:\n\nThe number of b-beautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s (between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1) such that:\n\n1. (b-1) divides s(s-1)\n\n2. a = s(s-1)/(b-1) must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 min(s, b-1)\n\nBecause a must be at least 1, and at most s (to keep c non-negative) and also at most b-1 (since it's a digit).\n\nBut since s \u2264 b-1, then min(s, b-1) is s, so the upper limit is s. So the constraints on a are 1 \u2264 a \u2264 s. Since a = s(s-1)/(b-1), this gives:\n\n1 \u2264 [s(s-1)]/(b-1) \u2264 s\n\nThe left inequality is equivalent to s(s-1) \u2265 (b -1)\n\nThe right inequality is equivalent to [s(s-1)]/(b-1) \u2264 s \u2192 s-1 \u2264 b -1 \u2192 s \u2264 b, which is already true.\n\nTherefore, the key inequalities are:\n\ns(s -1) \u2265 (b -1)\n\nand that (b -1) divides s(s -1)\n\nSo, for each s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, check if (b -1) divides s(s -1). If yes, then compute a = s(s -1)/(b -1). Then check if a is between 1 and s. Since s(s -1)/(b-1) must be \u22651, so s(s-1) \u2265 b -1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of valid s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that (b -1 divides s(s-1)), and s(s-1) \u2265 b -1.\n\nAlternatively, s(s-1) \u2265 b -1, but since s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)), so s is at least sqrt(b), so s(s-1) is at least sqrt(b)*(sqrt(b) -1). So unless b is very small, this will be much larger than b-1. Maybe for larger b, this condition is automatically satisfied?\n\nWait, but for example, if b is 5, then s starts at ceil(sqrt(5)) = 3. So s=3: 3*2=6, which is compared to b-1=4. 6 \u22654, so okay. So maybe except for very small b, this is okay. So perhaps the main constraint is divisibility.\n\nTherefore, the steps for each b:\n\n1. Determine the range of s: from s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)) up to s_max = b-1\n\n2. For each s in s_min to s_max:\n\n   a. Check if (b-1) divides s(s-1)\n\n   b. If yes, compute a = s(s-1)/(b-1)\n\n   c. Check if a is between 1 and s (since c must be non-negative)\n\n   d. If so, then this s corresponds to a valid number n = s\u00b2, which is a two-digit number in base b with digits a and c = s - a.\n\nTherefore, the total number of such s (and hence numbers n) is the count we need for each b.\n\nSo the problem now reduces to finding the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nTo find this, perhaps we can look for patterns or find a way to compute this count efficiently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find for each b the number of s in that range where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that s(s -1) must be divisible by (b-1). Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, the factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. So (b-1) divides s(s-1), so (b-1) must be a factor of s(s-1). Since gcd(s, s-1)=1, then (b-1) must be a product of some divisor of s and some divisor of (s-1). Since they are coprime, the factors must split between the two terms. Hence, (b-1) must be equal to d1*d2 where d1 divides s and d2 divides (s-1), and d1 and d2 are coprime.\n\nTherefore, for each s, the possible divisors of s(s-1) would be products of divisors of s and s-1. But maybe this is complicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s \u22610 or 1 mod some factors?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, the number of s is equal to the number of integers s in that interval where s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s-1 \u22610 mod (b-1). Wait, no, since s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). So that s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s \u22611 mod (b-1). Because if either s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s\u22611 mod (b-1), then s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b-1). Therefore, the solutions s must be congruent to 0 or 1 mod (b-1). But actually, more precisely, since s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1), it's necessary that either s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod d for each prime power in the prime factorization of (b-1). However, since (b-1) can be composite, the Chinese Remainder Theorem applies, but maybe for simplicity, let's see if s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s\u22611 mod (b-1) would be sufficient?\n\nWait, suppose (b-1) = m. Then s(s-1) \u22610 mod m. So either s \u22610 mod m or s \u22611 mod m. Because if m divides s(s-1), and since s and s-1 are coprime, m must divide s or m divides s-1. Therefore, yes! Exactly. Because since gcd(s, s-1)=1, then m divides s or m divides s-1. Therefore, s \u22610 mod m or s\u22611 mod m.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the s must satisfy s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1). Therefore, the possible s are those in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] that are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo (b-1). \n\nTherefore, the number of such s is equal to the number of integers in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] congruent to 0 or 1 mod (b-1).\n\nWait, but mod (b-1), the residues 0 and 1 are only two residues. However, since the modulus is (b-1), which is the number we're modding by, so the numbers congruent to 0 mod (b-1) would be s = k*(b-1). But since s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, the only multiple of (b-1) in that interval is s = b-1, since k=1 gives s = b-1, and k=2 would be 2*(b-1) which is larger than b-1.\n\nSimilarly, numbers congruent to 1 mod (b-1) would be s =1 + t*(b-1). The first one greater than or equal to ceil(sqrt(b)) would be s=1 + (b-1)*m. Let's see.\n\nWait, perhaps more precisely:\n\nNumbers congruent to 0 mod (b-1) in the interval:\n\nThe smallest such number is (b -1) if it is within the interval. Since s_max is b-1, so s=b-1 is included. So s = b-1 is one candidate. \n\nNumbers congruent to 1 mod (b-1):\n\nThe numbers are of the form 1 + k*(b-1). Let's see the minimal s in the interval [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]. The first such number would be 1, but that's too small. The next is 1 + (b-1) = b, but that's equal to the upper limit of s_max = b-1, so that's outside. Wait, so maybe only s=1 mod (b-1) would be s=1, but s has to be at least ceil(sqrt(b)). Unless b is small.\n\nWait, for example, take b=5. Then modulus is 4. So numbers congruent to 0 mod 4 in [ceil(sqrt(5))\u22483, 4], so s=4. Numbers congruent to 1 mod 4 are 1,5,9,\u2026 but in the interval [3,4], so s=1 is too small, 5 is outside. So only s=4 qualifies. But in this case, s=4, which is b-1. Wait, then for b=5:\n\nLet me check. For b=5, s must be between 3 (ceil(sqrt(5))\u22482.236, so ceil is 3) and 4. So s=3 and 4.\n\nCheck s=4: 4 mod 4 is 0, so yes. s=3: 3 mod 4 is 3, 3 mod4 \u22601 or 0. Wait, but 3 mod4 is 3, so not congruent 0 or1 mod4. So only s=4 qualifies. Let's see what n would be. a = s(s-1)/(b-1) =4*3/4=3. Then c =4-3=1. So n=3*5 +1=16. sqrt(16)=4. So 16 is 31 in base5 (3*5 +1). 3+1=4=sqrt(16). So yes, that works. But s=3 would need to check: s=3. Then check if 3 mod4 is 3, so not 0 or1 mod4. So indeed only s=4. So count is 1. So for b=5, only 1 b-eautiful number. \n\nWait, but perhaps my earlier conclusion that only s \u22610 or1 mod (b-1) is necessary and sufficient? Hmm, but in the problem statement example, 81 is 13-beautiful: 81 in base13 is 6 and 3, sum to 9, and sqrt(81)=9. Let me see for b=13:\n\ns =9, so s must be in [ceil(sqrt(13))\u22484, 12]. Then s=9. Check if 9 mod12 is 9, which is neither 0 nor1 mod12. Wait, but according to the previous logic, s needs to be 0 or1 mod (b-1)=12. But 9 mod12 isn't 0 or1, but yet it works. So my reasoning must be wrong here. \n\nWait, so here's a contradiction. That means my conclusion that s must be 0 or1 mod (b-1) is incorrect. Because in the example, s=9 and b=13, so b-1=12. Then s(s-1)=9*8=72. Then 72 must be divisible by 12, which it is (72/12=6). So 72 is divisible by 12. But 9 mod12 is 9, not 0 or1. So my mistake was in thinking that since s and s-1 are coprime, their product divisible by m implies m divides s or m divides s-1. However, that is only true if m is prime. Wait, no, actually, even if m is composite, since s and s-1 are coprime, any prime divisor of m must divide either s or s-1. But m can have prime factors dividing both s and s-1 only if they divide their difference, which is 1. So indeed, gcd(s, s-1)=1, so m divides s(s-1) implies m divides s or m divides s-1 only if m is square-free? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose m is composite. Let m = p*q where p divides s and q divides s-1, then m divides s(s-1). Since p divides s and q divides s-1, but p and q could be coprime. For example, m=12=3*4. Let me take s=9. Then 3 divides 9, and 4 divides 8 (since s-1=8). So 3 divides s and 4 divides s-1, so 12 divides s(s-1). So even if m is composite, as long as its prime factors can be partitioned into factors of s and s-1, then m divides s(s-1). So my previous conclusion that s \u22610 mod m or s\u22611 mod m is only a subset of possible solutions. Actually, the necessary and sufficient condition is that for each prime power in the factorization of m, it divides either s or s-1. But since m can be split into factors dividing s and s-1 in any way, so the congruence conditions are more complicated than just s \u22610 or1 mod m.\n\nTherefore, my previous approach was wrong, so I need to think differently.\n\nHmm, so perhaps going back to the equation: s(s-1) must be divisible by (b-1). Let me denote m = b -1. So m divides s(s-1). Since gcd(s,s-1)=1, then m must divide s or m divides s-1? No, actually, since m divides the product s(s-1), and since s and s-1 are coprime, m must divide s multiplied by 1, or m divides s-1 multiplied by 1. Wait, but that would mean m divides s or m divides s-1. Wait, but in the example with m=12 and s=9:\n\ngcd(9,8)=1. 12 divides 9*8=72, but 12 does not divide 9 nor 8. However, 12 divides 72, but since 9 and 8 are coprime, the factors of 12 can be split between 9 and 8. For example, 3 divides 9 and 4 divides 8, so together they make 12. So the condition is that m divides s(s-1), but m doesn't have to divide either s or s-1 individually, as long as its prime factors can be divided between s and s-1. \n\nSo my mistake was thinking that m divides s or m divides s-1, but actually it's possible that m is a product of factors from s and s-1. So the condition is weaker. Therefore, the congruence condition is not just s \u22610 or1 mod m, but more possibilities. Therefore, my earlier approach needs correction.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the only way is to compute for each b the number of s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 such that m = b-1 divides s(s-1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each m = b-1, the number of s between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod m. \n\nTo compute this, perhaps the number of solutions s in that interval is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] where s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod d for each prime power in the factorization? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to code this, but since I need to do this manually, maybe we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider small values of b and see how the count progresses, then see when it exceeds 10.\n\nStarting with b=2:\n\nb=2:\n\nDigits a and c must be between 1 and 1 (since base 2, two-digit numbers are 10 and 11 in base2, which are 2 and 3 in decimal). So n can be 2 or 3. The sqrt(n) must be integer. sqrt(2) is not integer, sqrt(3) is not. So zero numbers. So count=0.\n\nb=3:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base3: from 3 to 8 (since 3^2 -1 =8). \n\nPossible n must be perfect squares between 3 and8. So squares: 4 (2\u00b2), 9 is too big. So n=4. sqrt(4)=2. The digits in base3: 4 is 11 (1*3 +1). 1+1=2, which equals sqrt(4). So yes. Also check 9 would be 100 in base3, which is three digits, so not considered. So count=1.\n\nb=4:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base4: from4 to15. Squares:4,9,16( but 16 is 100 in base4, three digits). So n=4,9.\n\nCheck 4: base4 is 10. Digits 1 and0. Sum is1\u22602. Not valid.\n\nWait, 4 in base4 is 10, digits 1 and0. Their sum is1, but sqrt(4)=2. So not valid.\n\nn=9: 21 in base4 (2*4 +1). Sum 2+1=3, sqrt(9)=3. So yes. So count=1.\n\nb=5:\n\nAs before, only n=16 (31 in base5, sum 3+1=4= sqrt(16)). So count=1. Wait, but earlier when I considered s=4 (sqrt(16)=4), so that's correct. \n\nWait, but in my previous analysis for b=5, s=4 is the only one. So count=1.\n\nb=6:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base6:6 to35. Squares up to 35: 16 (4\u00b2),25 (5\u00b2),36 too big.\n\nCheck 16: base6 is 24 (2*6 +4). Sum 2+4=6\u22604. Not valid.\n\n25: base6 is41 (4*6 +1). Sum 4+1=5= sqrt(25)=5. So yes. So count=1.\n\nAlso check 9: but 9 is 13 in base6 (1+3=4\u22603). Not valid. So count=1.\n\nb=7:\n\nNumbers from7 to48. Squares:16,25,36,49 (too big). 49 is base7 100.\n\nCheck 16: 22 in base7 (2*7+2). Sum 4\u22604? Wait sqrt(16)=4. 2+2=4. So yes! 16 is 22 in base7. 2+2=4. So that counts.\n\n25: base7 is 34 (3*7 +4). Sum 7, but sqrt(25)=5. 3+4=7\u22605. Not valid.\n\n36: base7 is 51 (5*7 +1). Sum 6, sqrt(36)=6. 5+1=6. So that works. So 36 is valid.\n\nSo for b=7, n=16 and 36. So count=2.\n\nb=8:\n\nNumbers from8 to63. Squares: 16,25,36,49,64 (too big).\n\nCheck each:\n\n16: base8 is 20. 2+0=2\u22604. No.\n\n25: base8 is 31. 3+1=4\u22605.

Wait, but let's check others:\n\nWait 16 is 20 in base8: sum 2, not 4. 25 is 31: sum 4\u22605. 36 is 44: sum 8\u22606. 49 is 61: sum 7= sqrt(49). So only 1. Hmm. Wait, so actually only 49. So count=1.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed some?\n\nWait 9: sqrt(9)=3. In base8, 9 is 11. 1+1=2\u22603.\n\n16: already checked. 25: same. 36: same. 49. 64 too big.\n\nSo total 1. Hmmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's see.\n\nWait, 36 in base8 is 4*8 +4= 44. So digits 4 and4. Sum 8. sqrt(36)=6. So 8\u22606. So not valid. \n\n49 is 61, sum 7=7. Correct. So only 1. \n\nHmm. So count=1 for b=8.\n\nb=9:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base9: 9 to80. Squares up to80: 16,25,36,49,64,81 (too big).\n\nCheck each square:\n\n16: base9: 17 (1+7=8\u22604).

So that's valid. So count=1.\n\nWait, but also check 81 is 100, three digits. So only 64. So count=1.\n\nWait, but 49 in base9 is 5*9 +4 =49. 5+4=9, which is greater than sqrt(49)=7. So no. \n\nThus, count=1 for b=9.\n\nHmm, okay, moving on.\n\nb=10:\n\nNumbers from10 to99. Squares up to 99: 16,25,36,49,64,81.\n\nCheck each:\n\n16: 16 in base10 is 1 and6, sum7\u22604.

Wait 11^2 is 121, so 100 in base11 is 1*121 + ... no, wait 100 in decimal is 9*11 +1, which is two digits. So yes, 91 in base11. Wait 9*11 +1=100. So digits 9 and1, sum 10, which is sqrt(100)=10. So yes. So 100 is valid.\n\nTherefore, the valid numbers are 25 (23 base11, 2+3=5?), wait wait wait:\n\nWait, let me recheck each:\n\n25 in base11: 25 divided by11 is 2 with remainder 3.

No.\n\n121: 10*12 +1=121 \u2192 digits10 and1. Wait, but digits in base12 can only go up to 11 (digits 0-11). So 10 is a single digit, but in two digits, 121 is \"A1\" (using letters for digits above 9), but since we are to consider digits as numbers, the digits are 10 and1. So their sum is 11. sqrt(121)=11.

So far, up to b=25, the maximum count I found is 3 (for b=11,13,15,16,19,21,22,23,25). The highest count so far is 3 except for b=11 had 3, but maybe if I go higher, the counts might increase.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a pattern where for certain b, the count is higher.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation again:\n\nWe have the equation s(s-1) = a*(b-1), where a is between 1 and b-1, and c = s -a between 0 and b-1. So given that, for each b, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of s(s -1) that correspond to a valid a and s.\n\nAlternatively, for each b, the number of s is the number of integers s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 such that (b-1) divides s(s-1), and a = s(s-1)/(b-1) is an integer between 1 and s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for b-1 being a number with many factors, the count will be higher.\n\nPerhaps if b-1 is a highly composite number, then there are more s satisfying the condition.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when b-1 is a factorial or something, but maybe I need to think numerically.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to jump to a higher base, say b=37.\n\nWait but maybe first check b=25, but going further step by step.\n\nLet me check b=26:\n\nNumbers from26 to675 (26\u00b2-1=676-1=675).\n\nSquares up to675. sqrt(676)=26, so up to25\u00b2=625.\n\nCheck squares:\n\n25:1*26 -1?

Count=3.\n\nProceeding to higher bases like b=30:\n\nWait maybe this is taking too long. Alternatively, perhaps I can see a pattern where for b-1 being a factor of s(s-1).\n\nAlternatively, if we set m = b-1, then the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides s(s-1).\n\nPerhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in that interval where s \u22610 or1 mod d for divisors d of m?\n\nAlternatively, the equation s(s-1) \u22610 mod m implies that m divides s(s-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, m must divide s or m divides s-1. Wait, no! Wait, s and s-1 are coprime, so any prime dividing m must divide either s or s-1, but m itself doesn't need to divide s or s-1. However, if m divides s or m divides s-1, then definitely m divides s(s-1). But there might be other cases where m doesn't divide either s or s-1, but their product is divisible by m. \n\nBut perhaps counting the numbers s where s \u22610 mod m or s\u22611 mod m gives a lower bound?\n\nWait, for example, in the problem's example with b=13 (m=12), s=9, which is neither 0 nor1 mod12 (9 mod12 is9). But 9*8=72 divisible by12. So in this case, even though s isn't 0 or1 mod12, but 12 divides s(s-1). So the count is higher than just numbers congruent to 0 or1 mod m. \n\nSo perhaps the total number of s is equal to the number of s in the interval where s mod m is in the set {0,1} or in some other pairs where their product covers the factors of m.\n\nThis might be too abstract. Alternatively, maybe I can consider m = b-1, and for each divisor d of m, the solutions s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod (m/d). But this is getting into Chinese remainder theorem territory.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of m plus some other terms? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of m that are less than sqrt(m) or something? Not sure.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the equation a = s(s-1)/m, where m = b-1.\n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and s (since c = s -a must be non-negative), then:\n\n1 \u2264 s(s -1)/m \u2264 s.\n\nThe left inequality gives m \u2264 s(s-1).\n\nThe right inequality gives s(s -1)/m \u2264 s \u2192 s-1 \u2264 m \u2192 s \u2264 m+1, which is always true because s \u2264 b-1 =m.\n\nSo the key inequality is m \u2264 s(s-1).\n\nSince s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(m+1)), the minimal s is around sqrt(m). So s(s-1) is roughly s\u00b2 ~ m, so equality can hold. \n\nTherefore, for each m, the number of s between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m such that m divides s(s-1).\n\nTo maximize the count, we need m to have many divisors, so that s(s-1) can be multiples of m in more ways.\n\nTherefore, perhaps when m is a factorial or a highly composite number, the count increases.\n\nLet me try m=24 (b=25). Then m=24.\n\nWe need s between ceil(sqrt(25))=5 and 24.\n\nNumbers s in 5 to24 where 24 divides s(s-1).\n\nSo s(s-1) must be divisible by24.\n\n24=2^3*3.\n\nSo s(s-1) must be divisible by 8 and 3.\n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive, one of them is even, so s(s-1) divisible by 2.\n\nTo get divisibility by 8, either s or s-1 must be divisible by 8, or one divisible by 4 and the other divisible by 2.\n\nSimilarly, for divisibility by3, either s divisible by3 or s-1 divisible by3.\n\nTherefore, s must satisfy:\n\nEither s \u22610 mod8 or s \u22611 mod8 (to get divisibility by8 from one term), but also considering other combinations.\n\nAlternatively, to have s(s-1) divisible by8:\n\nThe product needs at least 3 factors of 2. Since s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even, the other odd. The even one must contribute at least 3 factors of 2. Either the even number is divisible by8, or the even number is divisible by4 and the other term is even (but since they are consecutive, the other is odd, so only the even term contributes).\n\nWait, since they are consecutive, one even, one odd. The even one must be divisible by8 or the even one must be divisible by4 and the odd one divisible by2? No, since the other is odd, so the even one must have at least three factors of 2 (i.e., divisible by8) or the even one divisible by4 and the other term divisible by2, but the other is odd, so that won't help. So only if the even term is divisible by8 or divisible by4 and the other term contributing another 2? But the other term is odd, so no. Thus, to have divisibility by8, the even term must be divisible by8.\n\nSimilarly, for 3: either s divisible by3 or s-1 divisible by3.\n\nThus, s must satisfy:\n\nEither:\n\nCase1: s \u22610 mod8 and (s\u22610 mod3 or s\u22611 mod3)\n\nCase2: s-1 \u22610 mod8 and (s\u22611 mod3 or s\u22610 mod3)\n\nWait, but actually:\n\nWait, the divisibility by3 requires either s \u22610 mod3 or s\u22611 mod3 (since s-1 \u2261-1 mod3, so if s-1 divisible by3 then s\u22611 mod3).\n\nWait, s divisible by3 or s\u22611 mod3.\n\nTherefore, combining the conditions for 8 and3:\n\nThe s must satisfy:\n\nEither:\n\n- s \u22610 mod8 and (s \u22610 mod3 or s\u22611 mod3)\n\nOR\n\n- s \u22611 mod8 and (s\u22611 mod3 or s\u22610 mod3)\n\nWait, but s\u22611 mod8 implies s-1\u22610 mod8, so the 8 divisibility comes from s-1 divisible by8. Then, for divisibility by3, s must be \u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nTherefore, the total conditions are:\n\nEither:\n\ns \u22610 mod8 and (s mod3 is 0 or1), or\n\ns \u22611 mod8 and (s mod3 is0 or1).\n\nThus, to find s in 5 to24 meeting these.\n\nLet me list s from5 to24:\n\nCheck each s:\n\ns=5: 5 mod8=5, not 0 or1. s mod3=2. Doesn't fit.\n\ns=6:6 mod8=6, not 0 or1. mod3=0. Doesn't fit.\n\ns=7:7 mod8=7. No.\n\ns=8:8 mod8=0. mod3=2. 8 mod3=2. Not 0 or1 mod3. So no.\n\ns=9:9 mod8=1. mod3=0. 9 mod3=0. So yes (since s\u22611 mod8 and s\u22610 mod3). So yes.\n\ns=10:10 mod8=2. No.\n\ns=11:11 mod8=3. No.\n\ns=12:12 mod8=4. No.\n\ns=13:13 mod8=5. No.\n\ns=14:14 mod8=6. No.\n\ns=15:15 mod8=7. No.\n\ns=16:16 mod8=0. mod3=1 (16/3=5*3+1). So yes (s\u22610 mod8 and s mod3=1). So yes.\n\ns=17:17 mod8=1. mod3=2. So s mod3=2\u22600 or1. No.\n\ns=18:18 mod8=2. No.\n\ns=19:19 mod8=3. No.\n\ns=20:20 mod8=4. No.\n\ns=21:21 mod8=5. 21 mod3=0. So s\u22615 mod8 and mod3=0. Not meeting 0 or1 mod8. So no.\n\ns=22:22 mod8=6. No.\n\ns=23:23 mod8=7. mod3=2. No.\n\ns=24:24 mod8=0. mod3=0. So s\u22610 mod8 and 0 mod3. So yes.\n\nThus valid s for m=24 (b=25) are s=9,16,24.\n\nCheck if these satisfy the original equation:\n\nFor each s:\n\ns=9: a = 9*8 /24 = 72/24=3. So a=3, c=9-3=6. Check digits: 3 and6 in base25. 3*25 +6=81. sqrt(81)=9. Correct.\n\ns=16: a=16*15/24=240/24=10. c=16-10=6. 10 and6 in base25: 10*25+6=256. sqrt(256)=16. Correct.\n\ns=24: a=24*23/24=23. c=24-23=1. 23 and1 in base25:23*25 +1=576. sqrt(576)=24. Correct.\n\nSo count=3, which matches earlier result.\n\nHmm, so for m=24 (b=25), count is3.\n\nBut to get count>10, we need more solutions. Perhaps when m has more factors.\n\nLet me try m=24 is too small.\n\nTry m=60 (b=61):\n\nWait, but maybe m=240 (b=241). Not sure. Alternatively, maybe m=60 (b=61). Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of m as a factorial. Let's pick m=120 (b=121). Let's see how many s would satisfy.\n\nBut this might take a long time. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 242 (since in the problem's example, the count is 1 for b=13, but maybe higher bases with higher factors can achieve more.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when m is a triangular number, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider m = s(s-1). So if m divides s(s-1), then m must be \u2264 s(s-1). Since s is between sqrt(m) and m, the maximum possible s is m, so s(s-1) can be up to m(m-1). So for m= b-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of s is approximately the number of factors of m, but I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the equation a = s(s-1)/m must be integer between1 and s.\n\nThus for each s between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m:\n\nIf s(s-1) mod m =0, then compute a = s(s-1)/m.\n\nIf a is between1 and s, then it's valid.\n\nThus the count is the number of such s where s(s-1) divisible by m and a \u2264 s.\n\nAlternatively, a = s(s-1)/m \u2264 s \u2192 (s-1)/m \u22641 \u2192 s-1 \u2264m \u2192 s \u2264 m+1, which is always true.\n\nThus the only conditions are s(s-1) divisible by m and a \u22651 \u2192 s(s-1) \u2265m.\n\nThus the count is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] where s(s-1) is divisible by m.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to for each m (starting from 1 upwards), compute the number of s between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m such that m divides s(s-1). Then, find the smallest m+1 (since b = m+1) where the count exceeds 10.\n\nBut since manually doing this for large m is impractical, perhaps I can find a mathematical pattern.\n\nSuppose m is a number such that it has many divisors, so that there are many s where s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod (m/d) for some divisors d of m.\n\nAlternatively, consider m being a factorial, but factorials grow rapidly.\n\nAlternatively, pick m=24 (b=25), which had count 3. m=60 (b=61):\n\nLet me try m=60 (b=61):\n\nWe need to find s between ceil(sqrt(61))\u22488 and 60 such that 60 divides s(s-1).\n\n60 factors into 2^2*3*5.\n\nThus s(s-1) must be divisible by 4,3,5.\n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive, their GCD is 1, so:\n\n- One of them divisible by4,\n\n- One divisible by3,\n\n- One divisible by5.\n\nThus conditions:\n\nEither:\n\ns \u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4,\n\ns \u22610 mod3 or s\u22611 mod3,\n\ns \u22610 mod5 or s\u22611 mod5.\n\nWait, but actually, to have 4 divides s(s-1):\n\nEither s\u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4 (since then s-1\u2261-1 mod4, but we need the product divisible by4). Wait:\n\nActually, s(s-1) divisible by4:\n\nEither s divisible by4, or s-1 divisible by4 (since then one of them is divisible by2 and the other by2 as well? Wait:\n\nActually, since s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even. To have the product divisible by4, the even number must be divisible by4.\n\nThus:\n\nEither s \u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4 (then s-1 is divisible by4).\n\nSimilarly, for divisibility by3:\n\nEither s divisible by3 or s-1 divisible by3.\n\nFor divisibility by5:\n\nEither s divisible by5 or s-1 divisible by5.\n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\n- (s \u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4),\n\n- (s \u22610 mod3 or s\u22611 mod3),\n\n- (s \u22610 mod5 or s\u22611 mod5).\n\nThis is a system of congruences. To count the number of s between 8 and60 satisfying these.\n\nThis requires using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to count solutions.\n\nLet me denote the conditions:\n\nLet me consider each of the three conditions:\n\nFor divisibility by4:\n\nLet\u2019s denote A: s \u22610 or1 mod4.\n\nFor divisibility by3:\n\nB: s\u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nFor divisibility by5:\n\nC: s\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nWe need to count s in [8,60] satisfying A,B,C.\n\nThis can be done by inclusion-exclusion or by considering all combinations.\n\nThere are 2*2*2=8 possible combinations of congruences:\n\nFor each modulus (4,3,5), choose either s\u22610 or s\u22611 mod m.\n\nEach combination corresponds to a system of congruences:\n\nFor example:\n\nCase1:\n\ns\u22610 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 mod5.\n\nThus s\u22610 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60.\n\nThus s=60. Which is within the range.\n\nCase2:\n\ns\u22610 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nFind s \u22610 mod12, and s \u22611 mod5.\n\nLet\u2019s solve s=12k \u22611 mod5 \u219212k \u22611 mod5 \u21922k\u22611 mod5 \u2192k\u22613 mod5. Thus k=5m+3. Thus s=12*(5m+3)=60m+36. Within 8-60:\n\nm=0: s=36,\n\nm=1:96>60. So only s=36.\n\nCase3:\n\ns\u22610 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod20 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nLet s=20k. Then 20k \u22611 mod3 \u219220k\u22612k\u22611 mod3 \u2192k\u22612 mod3. Thus k=3m+2. s=20*(3m+2)=60m+40. Within 8-60:\n\nm=0:40,\n\nm=1:100>60. So s=40.\n\nCase4:\n\ns\u22610 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet\u2019s solve s\u22610 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nSet s=4a.\n\nThen 4a \u22611 mod3 \u2192 a\u22611 mod3,\n\nand 4a \u22611 mod5 \u21924a\u22611 mod5 \u2192a\u22614^{-1}*1 mod5. Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5, so inverse is4. Thus a\u22614 mod5.\n\nThus a \u22611 mod3 and a\u22614 mod5.\n\nSolve for a:\n\nLet a=5b+4. Then 5b+4 \u22611 mod3 \u21925b \u2261-3 mod3 \u21922b\u22610 mod3 \u2192b\u22610 mod3. So b=3c. Thus a=5*(3c)+4=15c+4.\n\nThus s=4a=4*(15c+4)=60c+16.\n\nThus s=16, 76>60. So only s=16.\n\nCase5:\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 mod15 (since 3 and5).\n\nLet s=15k. Then 15k\u22611 mod4 \u219215k\u22613k\u22611 mod4 \u21923k\u22611 mod4 \u2192k\u22613 mod4. So k=4d+3. Thus s=15*(4d+3)=60d +45. Within 8-60:\n\nd=0:45,\n\nd=1:105>60. So s=45.\n\nCase6:\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet s=4a+1.\n\nThen 4a+1 \u22610 mod3 \u21924a\u2261-1 mod3 \u2192a\u2261-1*1 mod3 (since4\u22611 mod3) \u2192a\u22612 mod3,\n\nand 4a+1 \u22611 mod5 \u21924a\u22610 mod5 \u2192a\u22610 mod5.\n\nThus a\u22612 mod3 and a\u22610 mod5.\n\nLet a=5e. Then 5e \u22612 mod3 \u21925e\u22612 mod3 \u21922e\u22612 mod3 \u2192e\u22611 mod3. Thus e=3f+1. So a=5*(3f+1)=15f+5. Thus s=4*(15f+5)+1=60f+21. Within 8-60:\n\nf=0:21,\n\nf=1:81>60. So s=21.\n\nCase7:\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 mod5.\n\nLet s=3g+1. Also s\u22610 mod5 \u21923g+1\u22610 mod5 \u21923g\u2261-1 mod5 \u2192g\u2261(4)/3 mod5. 3^{-1}=2 mod5, so g\u22614*2=8\u22613 mod5 \u2192g=5h+3. Thus s=3*(5h+3)+1=15h+10. Also, s\u22611 mod4 \u219215h+10 \u22613h+2 \u22611 mod4 \u21923h\u2261-1 mod4 \u21923h\u22613 mod4 \u2192h\u22611 mod4. Thus h=4k+1. s=15*(4k+1)+10=60k+25. Within 8-60:\n\nk=0:25,\n\nk=1:85>60. So s=25.\n\nCase8:\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet\u2019s solve s\u22611 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60 \u2192 s=60k+1. Within 8-60:\n\nk=0:1 (too small),\n\nk=1:61 (over). So no solutions.\n\nThus all valid s are:\n\nCase1:60,\n\nCase2:36,\n\nCase3:40,\n\nCase4:16,\n\nCase5:45,\n\nCase6:21,\n\nCase7:25.\n\nAdditionally, we need to check s ranges from ceil(sqrt(61))=8 to60.\n\nAll the solutions are:\n\n16,21,25,36,40,45,60. So total of7 numbers.\n\nWait, so for m=60 (b=61), the count is7.\n\nHmm, still not exceeding10.\n\nContinuing, maybe m=120 (b=121):\n\nThis would take a while, but perhaps let's try m=240 (b=241). Alternatively, perhaps m=2520 (but too big).\n\nAlternatively, maybe m=360 (b=361):\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires a b where m=b-1 is a multiple of many numbers, such that there are many s in the range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 122, but I need another approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of s(s-1)/m =a must be integer between1 and s. So for each s from ceil(sqrt(m)) to m, the value a is s(s-1)/m. To have this integer, m divides s(s-1), and since a must be \u2264s, then s(s-1)/m \u2264s \u2192 (s-1)/m \u22641 \u2192 s \u2264m+1, which is true.\n\nTherefore, for each m, the count is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that s(s-1) divisible by m.\n\nNow, the question is to find the smallest b (so smallest m =b-1) where this count exceeds 10.\n\nPerhaps when m is a triangular number? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider m = product of first few primes.\n\nAlternatively, let me try m= 120 (b=121):\n\nThen m=120.\n\nWe need s between ceil(sqrt(121))=11 and 120.\n\nThe number of s where 120 divides s(s-1).\n\n120= 2^3*3*5.\n\nSo s(s-1) must be divisible by 8,3,5.\n\nSimilar to m=60.\n\nTo satisfy divisibility by8:\n\nEither s divisible by8 or s-1 divisible by8.\n\nDivisible by3: s or s-1 divisible by3.\n\nDivisible by5: s or s-1 divisible by5.\n\nThus, the conditions are:\n\nFor each prime power in 8,3,5:\n\n- For 8: s \u22610 or1 mod8,\n\n- For 3: s\u22610 or1 mod3,\n\n- For5: s\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, similar to m=60 but with an extra factor of 2^3 instead of 2^2.\n\nThe count would be higher.\n\nBut doing this manually would take time. Maybe an approximate approach.\n\nAlternatively, notice that for m=24 (b=25), count=3,\n\nm=60 (b=61), count=7,\n\nm=120 (b=121), count=?\n\nPossibly 15? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps b=242 (m=241). But 241 is prime.\n\nAlternatively, m= 2520, but too big.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 122 (m=121), but need to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 122.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider m= 105 (b=106):\n\nThen m=105=3*5*7.\n\nThus s(s-1) must be divisible by 3,5,7.\n\nThus:\n\nEither s divisible by3 or s-1 divisible by3,\n\nSimilarly for 5 and7.\n\nThis gives many combinations.\n\nBut the count would be higher than m=60.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 122.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first b where the count exceeds 10 is b= 122.\n\nAlternatively, let me try m= 60 (b=61) gives7.\n\nm= 84 (b=85):\n\nCompute count for m=84 (b=85). Let's see.\n\nm=84=2^2*3*7.\n\nConditions:\n\nDivisible by4,3,7.\n\nThus:\n\ns divisible by4 or s-1 divisible by4,\n\ns divisible by3 or s-1 divisible by3,\n\ns divisible by7 or s-1 divisible by7.\n\nSo, similar approach.\n\nThe number of solutions would be combinations of congruences.\n\nBut doing this manually is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 242.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of s(s-1) divisible by m =b-1.\n\nFor large m, the number of s between sqrt(m) and m where s(s-1) divisible by m would be roughly the number of divisors of m or similar.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first time the count exceeds 10 is at b= 242.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula.\n\nWait, in the equation s(s-1) divisible by m, the number of s is equal to the number of divisors of m plus something, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, notice that for s from1 tom, the number of solutions to s(s-1) divisible by m is equal to the number of fractions s/m where the fraction is a solution, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of s \u22610 or1 mod d for each divisor d of m.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract.\n\nPerhaps the minimal b is 122, but I need to think of another approach.\n\nWait, let's think of the equation a = s(s-1)/(b-1).\n\nSince a must be between1 and s, then s(s-1) must be at least (b-1).\n\nBut s is at least sqrt(b), so s(s-1) ~ s\u00b2 ~ b.\n\nTherefore, the number of s in [sqrt(b), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nThis is similar to counting the number of s near sqrt(b) to b where s(s-1) is a multiple of (b-1).\n\nPerhaps when (b-1) is a triangular number, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, suppose b-1 divides s(s-1). Let me set s =k*(b-1)+r.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when b-1 is a divisor of s(s-1), then s(s-1) must be a multiple of b-1.\n\nSuppose we let s = t, then t(t-1) must be divisible by b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each t from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, we can compute this.\n\nAlternatively, to maximize the number of t's, we can have b-1 being a number with many factors so that many t's make t(t-1) divisible by b-1.\n\nThe number of solutions t would be roughly proportional to the number of factors of b-1.\n\nThus, the minimal b would be when b-1 is a highly composite number.\n\nThe highly composite numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, etc.\n\nLet me try m=60 (b=61) gives count=7,\n\nm=120 (b=121) probably gives more.\n\nLet me try m= 120 (b=121):\n\nWe need to count s between ceil(sqrt(121))=11 and 120 such that 120 divides s(s-1).\n\n120=2^3*3*5.\n\nThus, s(s-1) must be divisible by8,3,5.\n\nConditions:\n\n- For8: s divisible by8 or s-1 divisible by8,\n\n- For3: s divisible by3 or s-1 divisible by3,\n\n- For5: s divisible by5 or s-1 divisible by5.\n\nThus, each condition has two options, so total combinations are2^3=8 cases.\n\nEach case corresponds to a system of congruences. We need to find s in 11-120 for each case.\n\nLet me proceed similarly to m=60 case.\n\nFirst, list all possible combinations:\n\nCase1: s\u22610 mod8, s\u22610 mod3, s\u22610 mod5 \u2192 s\u22610 mod lcm(8,3,5)=120 \u2192 s=120.\n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod8, s\u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod24,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nSolve s=24k\u22611 mod5 \u219224k\u22614k\u22611 mod5 \u21924k\u22611 mod5 \u2192k\u22614^{-1}*1\u22614 mod5.\n\nThus k=5m +4. So s=24*(5m+4)=120m +96. Within 11-120:\n\nm=0:96,\n\nm=1:216>120.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. Let me first make sure I understand the problem correctly. \n\nA number n is called b-beautiful if two conditions are met: first, when written in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1, right? Because a two-digit number in base b would be from 10_b (which is b in decimal) up to (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 - 1. \n\nSecond, the sum of its two digits must equal the square root of n. So if the two digits in base b are, say, d1 and d0 (where d1 is the digit in the \"b's place\" and d0 is the units digit), then d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). Also, since it's a two-digit number in base b, d1 must be between 1 and b-1, and d0 between 0 and b-1. \n\nSo n can be written as n = d1*b + d0. And according to the condition, d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). Therefore, substituting n, we have:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)\n\nLet me write that equation again for clarity:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)\n\nHmm, so we need to find integers d1 and d0 (with d1 from 1 to b-1 and d0 from 0 to b-1) such that when you compute d1*b + d0, its square root is exactly d1 + d0. \n\nLet me square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. That gives:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0\u00b2 = d1*b + d0\n\nLet me rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0\u00b2 - d1*b - d0 = 0\n\nHmm, maybe it's better to keep it as:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nSo,\n\nd1*b + d0 = (d1 + d0)^2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to solve for b. Let's see:\n\nd1*b = (d1 + d0)^2 - d0\n\nTherefore,\n\nb = [(d1 + d0)^2 - d0]/d1\n\nHmm, that's an expression for b in terms of d1 and d0. Since b has to be an integer greater than or equal to 2, and d1 and d0 are digits in base b (so d0 can be 0 to b-1, but since b is expressed in terms of d1 and d0 here, maybe we need another approach).\n\nAlternatively, since we have expressions involving d1 and d0, perhaps for each possible b, we can find all pairs (d1, d0) that satisfy the equation, then count how many such n exist for each b, and find the smallest b where the count exceeds ten.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the minimal b where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers, perhaps we can find for each b, the number of solutions (d1, d0) to the equation (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0, with the constraints that d1 is from 1 to b-1, d0 from 0 to b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, we can iterate over possible d1 and d0, check if the equation holds, and count the number of such pairs. But since doing this manually for each b up to some number might be tedious, perhaps we can find a smarter way to parametrize the solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for given d1 and d0, the required b is [(d1 + d0)^2 - d0]/d1. Since b has to be an integer, this fraction must be integer. Also, since d0 must be less than b (because it's a digit in base b), but since b is expressed in terms of d1 and d0, perhaps we can think of possible d1 and d0 values such that [(d1 + d0)^2 - d0]/d1 is an integer, and then ensure that d0 < b and d1 < b. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps rearrange the equation to express in terms of variables.\n\nLet me denote s = d1 + d0, so s is the sum of the digits and also the square root of n. Therefore, n = s^2, and n = d1*b + d0. Hence, s^2 = d1*b + d0. But since s = d1 + d0, we can substitute d0 = s - d1 into the equation:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)\n\nSimplify:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + s - d1\n\nRearranged:\n\ns^2 - s = d1*(b - 1)\n\nThus,\n\nd1 = (s^2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, so this gives d1 in terms of s and b. Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, then (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be between 1 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, since d0 = s - d1, then d0 must be between 0 and b-1 as well, so s - d1 must be in that interval. Since d1 is at least 1, s - d1 \u2264 s - 1. But d0 must be non-negative, so s - d1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 d1 \u2264 s. Also, since d0 < b, so s - d1 < b \u21d2 d1 > s - b. \n\nTherefore, combining all these constraints:\n\n1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 min(b -1, s)\n\nand\n\nd1 > s - b\n\nBut this might complicate things. Perhaps another approach is better.\n\nLooking back at the equation:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + d0, with s = d1 + d0.\n\nWait, since s = d1 + d0, then substituting d0 = s - d1 into the first equation gives:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + s - d1 \u21d2 s^2 - s = d1*(b -1). \n\nSo, as before, d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1). Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, this provides a condition that (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and the quotient must be between 1 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, since s^2 - s must be divisible by (b -1), so (b-1) divides (s^2 - s). Let me denote k = b -1, so then k divides s(s - 1). Since s(s -1) is two consecutive integers, their product is divisible by 2, but here k divides their product. So k must be a divisor of s(s-1). \n\nBut s is equal to the square root of n, and n is a two-digit number in base b, so n is at most b^2 - 1, so s = sqrt(n) must be at most sqrt(b^2 -1) < b. Therefore, s is less than b. Since s is a positive integer, s can be from 1 up to b -1. Wait, but s must be at least sqrt(b), since n is at least b (the smallest two-digit number in base b is b). So sqrt(n) \u2265 sqrt(b), so s \u2265 sqrt(b). But s is an integer. So s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe let's think in terms of possible s values.\n\nAlternatively, since s^2 = n = d1*b + d0, and d1 and d0 are digits in base b, so 0 \u2264 d0 < b, 1 \u2264 d1 < b. So, the number n = d1*b + d0 must be between b (when d1=1, d0=0) and b^2 -1 (when d1=b-1, d0=b-1). Therefore, s = sqrt(n) must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 -1). Since sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, s must be an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the possible s values are integers from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b -1. For each such s, we can compute d1 as (s^2 - s)/(b -1). Since d1 has to be an integer between 1 and b -1, the equation (s^2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be in that range. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of s values that satisfy the divisibility condition and produce a valid d1 would be the number of b-beautiful numbers. We need to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can reorganize the equation. Let me consider the equation again:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + d0,\n\nwhere d0 = s - d1,\n\ntherefore substituting,\n\ns^2 = d1*b + (s - d1)\n\n=> s^2 - s = d1*(b -1)\n\nSo,\n\nd1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nSo for each possible s, and for a given b, if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), then d1 is an integer. Then, once d1 is determined, d0 = s - d1 must also be a valid digit (i.e., between 0 and b-1). \n\nSo for a given b, the number of b-beautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that:\n\n1. (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1),\n\n2. d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b -1) is between 1 and b -1 (since d1 is a digit in base b),\n\n3. d0 = s - d1 is between 0 and b -1 (since it's a digit in base b).\n\nTherefore, to compute the number for a given b, we can iterate over s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, check the divisibility condition, then check the constraints on d1 and d0. \n\nOur goal is to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find s and b such that s^2 - s is a multiple of b-1, and then see how many s correspond to each b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider variables differently. Let me suppose that for each s, there might be some b's that work. For each s, the possible b's would be those where (b -1) divides s(s -1). Therefore, b -1 must be a divisor of s(s-1). So, for each s, the possible b's are of the form d +1, where d divides s(s-1). Then, for each such b = d +1, we can check if the corresponding d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nBut perhaps this is a way to parameterize the problem. Let's think of s as varying first. Let me see. Let me try to approach this step by step.\n\nFirst, note that for each b, the number of s is going to be the number of possible s where s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, and (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the resulting d1 and d0 are valid digits.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to find for each possible s, the possible b's that can be formed, and then count how many times each b is hit. Since we need to find the minimal b with more than 10 hits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe start testing values of b starting from small and see when the count exceeds 10. But this might take a while. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps first find expressions for possible s and b. Let me see.\n\nSuppose that (b -1) divides s(s -1). Let me denote k = b -1. So k divides s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are coprime (consecutive integers), k must divide s or k divides s-1, or split into factors dividing each. \n\nSo k divides s(s-1) implies that the prime factors of k must be distributed between s and s-1. Since s and s-1 are coprime, any prime factor of k must divide either s or s-1, but not both. \n\nTherefore, the divisors of k (b-1) must be factors of s or factors of s-1. \n\nTherefore, for a given s, the possible k (which is b-1) must be a divisor of s(s-1). So for each s, the possible k's (and therefore b's) are the divisors of s(s-1), but also such that when we compute d1 = (s^2 - s)/k, then d1 must be between 1 and k (since d1 < b = k+1), and d0 = s - d1 must be between 0 and k (since d0 < b = k+1). \n\nWait, since d0 = s - d1, and d1 is (s^2 - s)/k, then substituting:\n\nd0 = s - (s^2 - s)/k = s - [s(s -1)/k]\n\nSo, since d0 must be between 0 and k (since b = k +1, so digits go up to k), so:\n\n0 \u2264 s - [s(s -1)/k] \u2264 k\n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of s and k. Let me set k = b -1. Then, for each s from 2 upwards, we can see for each divisor k of s(s-1), whether the constraints on d1 and d0 are satisfied, then note that b = k+1, and count how many s correspond to each b. \n\nThis might be a way to compute for each b, the number of s that can form it, but perhaps this is getting too abstract. Let me try to see with some examples.\n\nFirst, let me try small values of b and see how many b-beautiful numbers there are. Maybe this will give a pattern or help find the minimal b.\n\nStarting with b=2:\n\nFor b=2, the two-digit numbers in base 2 are from 2 (10_2) to 3 (11_2). So possible n are 2 and 3.\n\nCheck the condition:\n\nFirst, n=2: digits are 1 and 0. Sum is 1+0=1. sqrt(2) is approx 1.414, not integer. So no.\n\nSecond, n=3: digits 1 and 1. Sum is 2. sqrt(3) \u22481.732. Not 2. So no. So for b=2, 0 numbers.\n\nb=3:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base 3: from 3 (10_3) to 8 (22_3). So n can be 3 to 8.\n\nCheck each:\n\nn=3: digits (1,0). Sum 1. sqrt(3)\u22481.732. Not integer. \n\nn=4: digits (1,1). Sum 2. sqrt(4)=2. So yes! 4 is 3-eautiful.\n\nn=5: (1,2). Sum 3. sqrt(5)\u22482.236. Not 3.\n\nn=6: (2,0). Sum 2. sqrt(6)=~2.449.

So count=1.\n\nb=4:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base4: from 4 (10_4) to 15 (33_4). So n from 4 to 15.\n\nCheck each:\n\nn=4: (1,0). Sum 1. sqrt(4)=2. Not 1.\n\nn=5: (1,1). Sum 2. sqrt(5)=~2.236.

Count=1.\n\nb=5:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base5: 5 (10_5) to 24 (44_5).\n\nChecking each n:\n\nStart with n=5: (1,0). Sum 1. sqrt(5)=~2.236. Not 1.\n\nn=6: (1,1). Sum 2. sqrt(6)=~2.449.

Let's see if there's a pattern here. Maybe up to b=10, each b only has one such number. Maybe we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me see if I can find a formula for the number of solutions.\n\nWe had the equation s^2 = d1*b + d0, where d0 = s - d1, so substituting gives s^2 = d1*b + (s - d1), so s^2 - s = d1*(b -1). \n\nSo d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b -1, then (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) must be in that interval.\n\nAlso, since d0 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b-1, so s - d1 >=0 => d1 <= s, and s - d1 < b => d1 > s - b. But since d1 is at least 1, and s is less than b (since sqrt(n) < b, since n < b\u00b2). \n\nWait, actually, n = s\u00b2 must be less than b\u00b2, so s < b. So s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1.\n\nWait, so s is up to b-1. Let me consider possible s values for a given b. Let me suppose that s is between 1 and b-1, but actually starting from ceil(sqrt(b)), since n must be at least b (the smallest two-digit number in base b is b). So s must be at least sqrt(b), so s >= ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nTherefore, for each b, s ranges from s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)) to s_max = b-1. For each s in that interval, check if (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b-1). If yes, then compute d1 = (s^2 - s)/(b-1). Then check that d1 is between 1 and b-1. Also, d0 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b-1. Since d1 is between 1 and (s^2 - s)/(b-1) ... Wait, but since (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), d1 must be exactly (s^2 - s)/(b -1). \n\nWait, but if d1 is between 1 and b-1, then that's already part of the condition. Also, d0 = s - d1 must be non-negative, so s - d1 >=0 => d1 <= s. Since d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1), so (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) <= s \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s <= s(b -1) \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s - s(b -1) <=0 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s*b <=0 \u21d2 s(s - b) <=0.\n\nSince s is between 1 and b-1, s - b is negative, so s(s - b) is negative or zero. Therefore, the inequality holds. So d1 <= s is automatically satisfied. \n\nSimilarly, d0 = s - d1 must be less than b. Let's see:\n\nd0 = s - ( (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) ) \n\nWe need this to be less than b. Let me rearrange:\n\ns - (s(s -1))/(b -1) < b\n\nMultiply both sides by (b -1):\n\ns(b -1) - s(s -1) < b(b -1)\n\nExpand left side:\n\ns*b - s - s\u00b2 + s < b\u00b2 - b\n\nSimplify terms:\n\ns*b - s\u00b2 < b\u00b2 - b\n\nBring all terms to the right:\n\n0 < b\u00b2 - b - s*b + s\u00b2\n\nFactor:\n\n0 < b\u00b2 - b - b s + s\u00b2 \n\n= b\u00b2 - b(1 + s) + s\u00b2 \n\nHmm, perhaps this is a quadratic in b? Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, rearranged:\n\ns\u00b2 - s*b + b\u00b2 - b >0\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps let me think numerically. Since s < b, perhaps this inequality holds?\n\nAlternatively, maybe since d0 must be less than b, which is the base, that is automatically satisfied because d0 = s - d1, and since s < b and d1 is at least 1, then s - d1 is at most s -1 < b -1 < b. Wait, s is less than b, so s -1 is less than b -1, so d0 is less than b-1 < b. Therefore, d0 is automatically less than b. Since d0 is non-negative, it's between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo actually, the only constraints are:\n\n1. s is an integer from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1.\n\n2. (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b-1).\n\n3. d1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1) must be between 1 and b-1.\n\nBut since d1 is (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1). Let's see for d1 to be at least 1:\n\n(s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u22651 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s \u2265 b -1 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s - (b -1) \u22650\n\nSimilarly, to be at most b-1:\n\n(s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nTherefore, the constraints on s are:\n\nceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 s \u2264 b-1,\n\nand\n\ns\u00b2 - s \u2265 (b -1),\n\nand\n\ns\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nBut perhaps this is complicating. Maybe the key is that (b -1) divides (s\u00b2 - s). \n\nAlternatively, for each b, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] where (s\u00b2 - s) mod (b -1) =0.\n\nSo maybe we can think of s^2 - s \u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nSo s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nTherefore, since s and s-1 are coprime, the factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. Therefore, for each s in the range, the number of divisors (b-1) of s(s-1). \n\nAlternatively, for each b, the number of s such that s mod (b-1) \u22610 or s \u22611 mod (b-1). Wait, not exactly, since s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, then (b-1) must divide either s or s-1, but not necessarily entirely. Since their product is divisible by (b-1), the factors of (b-1) can be split between s and s-1. \n\nFor instance, if (b-1) is 6, then it can divide s or s-1, or have some factors in s and others in s-1. \n\nBut maybe it's better to consider for a given b, how many s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] satisfy s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nPerhaps let me try with higher b. Maybe b=12?\n\nWait, but this trial and error might take long. Alternatively, perhaps think of s and b such that s^2 - s = k*(b-1), where k is an integer between 1 and b-1 (since d1 is between 1 and b-1). \n\nTherefore, for each s, let me suppose that k = d1, so s^2 - s = k*(b-1). Then, b = (s^2 - s)/k +1. Since b must be an integer greater than 1, (s^2 - s)/k must be integer. \n\nTherefore, for each s and k where 1 \u2264k \u2264b-1, but since b depends on s and k, perhaps it's better to think that for each pair (s, k), b can be computed as (s\u00b2 - s)/k +1. Then, for this b to be valid, we must have:\n\n1. b must be an integer \u22652,\n\n2. s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1,\n\n3. k must be between 1 and b-1,\n\nBut this is a bit recursive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s \u22652, and for each divisor k of s(s-1), we can compute b = (s(s-1)/k) +1, then check if s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], and then count how many times each b is generated by such pairs (s, k). \n\nThis might be a way to compute the counts for each b.\n\nPerhaps let's try some s values and see what b's they can produce. Let me pick s starting from 2 upwards.\n\nStarting with s=2:\n\ns=2:\n\ns(s-1)=2*1=2.\n\nDivisors k of 2 are 1,2.\n\nThus, possible k=1 and 2.\n\nFor k=1:\n\nb=(2*1)/1 +1=2+1=3.\n\nCheck if s=2 is in [ceil(sqrt(3)), 2]:\n\nceil(sqrt(3))=2, so 2 is in [2,2]. So yes. \n\nThus, this gives a valid b=3 with s=2, k=1. So this corresponds to the number n= s\u00b2=4, which is 10 in base3: 1*3 +0=3, which is not 4. Wait, hold on. Wait, perhaps my approach is missing something here.\n\nWait, when s=2 and k=1, then d1=k=1. Then d0 = s -d1=1. So n= d1*b +d0 =1*3 +1=4, which is correct. So 4 is 3-eautiful. So this is valid. \n\nFor k=2:\n\nb=(2*1)/2 +1=1 +1=2. \n\nNow check if s=2 is in [ceil(sqrt(2)), 1]. But ceil(sqrt(2))\u22482, but b=2, so the upper limit is b-1=1. So 2 is not in [2,1]. So invalid. \n\nThus, s=2 gives only b=3.\n\nNext s=3:\n\ns(s-1)=3*2=6. Divisors k:1,2,3,6.\n\nCompute for each k:\n\nk=1:\n\nb=(6)/1 +1=7.\n\nCheck if s=3 is in [ceil(sqrt(7)),6]. sqrt(7)\u22482.645, so ceil is 3. So 3 is in [3,6]. yes.\n\nThus, this gives b=7.\n\nk=2:\n\nb=6/2 +1=3+1=4.\n\nCheck s=3 in [ceil(sqrt(4)), 3]. sqrt(4)=2, so ceil is 2. So 3 is in [2,3]. yes.\n\nThus, b=4.\n\nk=3:\n\nb=6/3 +1=2+1=3.\n\nCheck s=3 in [ceil(sqrt(3)),2]. ceil(sqrt(3))=2, so [2,2]. s=3 is outside. Not valid.\n\nk=6:\n\nb=6/6 +1=1+1=2. \n\nCheck s=3 in [ceil(sqrt(2)),1]. Not valid.\n\nThus, s=3 gives b=7 and b=4.\n\nProceeding to s=4:\n\ns(s-1)=4*3=12. Divisors:1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nk=1:\n\nb=12/1 +1=13. Check s=4 in [ceil(sqrt(13)),12]. sqrt(13)\u22483.605, ceil=4. So 4 is in [4,12]. Valid.\n\nk=2:\n\nb=12/2 +1=6+1=7. Check s=4 in [ceil(sqrt(7)),6]. sqrt(7)=~2.645, ceil=3. So 4 is in [3,6]. yes.\n\nk=3:\n\nb=12/3 +1=4+1=5. Check s=4 in [ceil(sqrt(5)),4]. sqrt(5)=~2.236, ceil=3. 4 is in [3,4]. yes.\n\nk=4:\n\nb=12/4 +1=3+1=4. Check s=4 is in [ceil(sqrt(4)),3]. ceil(sqrt(4))=2, so [2,3]. s=4 is outside.\n\nk=6:\n\nb=12/6 +1=2+1=3. Check s=4 vs b=3. s=4 > b-1=2. Not valid.\n\nk=12:\n\nb=12/12 +1=1+1=2. s=4 vs base 2? Not valid.\n\nThus, s=4 gives b=13,7,5.\n\nContinuing with s=5:\n\ns=5, s(s-1)=20. Divisors: 1,2,4,5,10,20.\n\nk=1: b=21. Check s=5 in [ceil(sqrt(21)),20]. sqrt(21)=~4.583, ceil=5. So yes.\n\nk=2: b=10 +1=11. Check s=5 in [ceil(sqrt(11)),10]. sqrt(11)=~3.316, ceil=4. 5 is in [4,10]. yes.\n\nk=4: b=20/4 +1=5+1=6. Check s=5 in [ceil(sqrt(6)),5]. sqrt(6)=~2.449, ceil=3. So 5 in [3,5]. yes.\n\nk=5: b=20/5 +1=4+1=5. Check s=5 in [ceil(sqrt(5)),4]. ceil=3. 5>4. Not valid.\n\nk=10: b=2+1=3. s=5> base 3's digits? 5 in base3 is 12, but the two-digit numbers in base3 go up to 8 (22). But s=5 would require base 3? Wait, but b=3 here. Wait, s=5 is sqrt(n)=5, so n=25. But in base3, 25 is 221, which is three digits, so invalid. Hence, not valid.\n\nk=20: b=1+1=2. s=5 too big. Not valid.\n\nThus, s=5 gives b=21,11,6.\n\nProceeding to s=6:\n\ns=6, s(s-1)=30. Divisors:1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.\n\nk=1: b=31. Check s=6 in [ceil(sqrt(31)),30]. sqrt(31)=~5.567, ceil=6. yes.\n\nk=2: b=15+1=16. Check s=6 in [ceil(sqrt(16)),15]. sqrt(16)=4, so [4,15]. yes.\n\nk=3: b=10+1=11. Check s=6 in [ceil(sqrt(11)),10]. sqrt(11)=~3.316, ceil=4. yes.\n\nk=5: b=6+1=7. Check s=6 in [ceil(sqrt(7)),6]. sqrt(7)=~2.645, ceil=3. yes.\n\nk=6: b=5+1=6. Check s=6 vs b=6. s must be <b, so 6 is not <6. So no.\n\nk=10: b=3+1=4. Check s=6 in base4? The two-digit numbers go up to 15. sqrt(36)=6, but in base4, 6 is 12, which is two digits. Wait, n=36 would be in base4 as 210, which is three digits. Wait, actually n=s\u00b2=36. In base4, 36 divided by 4 is 9, remainder 0; 9 divided by4 is 2 rem 1; 2 divided by4 is 0 rem2. So 210_4, which is three digits. So invalid. So s=6 with b=4 would not work. \n\nWait, but let's check the constraints for b=4 and s=6:\n\nb=4, s=6. Then, the required n is s\u00b2=36, but in base4, 36 is three digits. So it doesn't qualify. Therefore, even though the equation might hold, the number must be two digits in base b. Therefore, the requirement that n < b\u00b2 is essential. \n\nWait, in the case of k=10 for s=6, we get b=(30)/10 +1=3+1=4. But s=6, but sqrt(n)=6, so n=36. Since n=36 must be a two-digit number in base4, but 4^3=64>36, so it would be three digits. Therefore, this is invalid. \n\nTherefore, even though the equation might hold, the number n must be two-digit in base b. So for the case of k=10 and s=6, leading to b=4, the n=36 is not a two-digit number in base4, so it's invalid. So we must also ensure that n = s\u00b2 < b\u00b2, so s < b. Since s=6 and b=4, this is violated. So even if the equation holds, the number must be two-digit. Therefore, we have an additional constraint: s < b. \n\nWait, but s is sqrt(n), and n is a two-digit number in base b, so n < b\u00b2. Therefore, s must be less than b. Since s is an integer, s \u2264 b-1. Which is already part of the earlier constraints. \n\nTherefore, in the case of b=4 and s=6, since s=6 \u2265 b=4, this is invalid. Therefore, even if the equation is satisfied, it is rejected. \n\nThus, when evaluating for each s and k, we must also ensure that s < b. Since b=(s(s-1)/k) +1, so s < (s(s-1)/k)+1. Rearranged: s -1 < s(s-1)/k \u21d2 k < s. \n\nTherefore, in addition to the previous constraints, we need k < s. Because if k >= s, then s(s-1)/k <= s-1, so b = s(s-1)/k +1 <= (s-1) +1 = s. Thus, s < b would require that s(s-1)/k +1 > s \u21d2 s(s-1)/k > s -1 \u21d2 s -1/k > s-1 \u21d2 which would require 1/k >0, but this is always true. Wait, maybe my algebra is off. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to just compute b and check whether s < b. \n\nThus, for s=6 and k=10, b=4, s=6 is not less than b=4. So we must exclude this. \n\nThus, in the case of s=6 and k=10, we have to discard it. Similarly, other ks must be considered.\n\nContinuing with s=6:\n\nk=15: b=2+1=3. s=6 vs b=3: s >=b, invalid.\n\nk=30: b=1+1=2. s=6 too big.\n\nk=6 is already considered. \n\nThus, valid k's for s=6 are 1,2,3,5 (excluding k=6,10,15,30 where s >=b). \n\nThus, s=6 gives b=31,16,11,7.\n\nProceeding to s=7:\n\ns=7, s(s-1)=42. Divisors of 42:1,2,3,6,7,14,21,42.\n\nk=1: b=43. s=7 <43. Yes. \n\nk=2: b=21+1=22. s=7 <22. yes.\n\nk=3: b=14+1=15. yes.\n\nk=6: b=7+1=8. s=7 <8. yes.\n\nk=7: b=6+1=7. s=7 not less than 7. reject.\n\nk=14: b=3+1=4. s=7 vs b=4. 7>4. reject.\n\nk=21: b=2+1=3. 7>3.\n\nk=42: b=1+1=2. 7>2.\n\nThus, valid k's are 1,2,3,6. So b=43,22,15,8.\n\nContinuing with s=8:\n\ns=8: s(s-1)=56. Divisors:1,2,4,7,8,14,28,56.\n\nk=1: b=57. s=8 <57. yes.\n\nk=2: b=28 +1=29. yes.\n\nk=4: b=14+1=15. yes.\n\nk=7: b=8+1=9. yes.\n\nk=8: b=7+1=8. s=8 not less than 8. reject.\n\nk=14: b=4+1=5. s=8 vs b=5. 8>5. reject.\n\nk=28: b=2+1=3. 8>3.\n\nk=56: b=1+1=2. 8>2.\n\nThus, valid k's:1,2,4,7. So b=57,29,15,9.\n\ns=9:\n\ns=9, s(s-1)=72. Divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72.\n\nk=1: b=73. yes.\n\nk=2: b=36+1=37. yes.\n\nk=3: b=24+1=25. yes.\n\nk=4: b=18+1=19. yes.\n\nk=6: b=12+1=13. yes.\n\nk=8: b=9+1=10. yes (since 9 <10).\n\nk=9: b=8+1=9. s=9 not less than 9. reject.\n\nk=12: b=6+1=7. s=9 vs b=7. reject.\n\nk=18: b=4+1=5. reject.\n\nk=24: b=3+1=4. reject.\n\nk=36: b=2+1=3. reject.\n\nk=72: b=1+1=2. reject.\n\nThus, valid k:1,2,3,4,6,8. Thus b=73,37,25,19,13,10.\n\nContinuing with s=10:\n\ns=10: s(s-1)=90. Divisors:1,2,3,5,6,9,10,15,18,30,45,90.\n\nk=1: b=91. yes.\n\nk=2: b=45+1=46. yes.\n\nk=3: b=30+1=31. yes.\n\nk=5: b=18+1=19. yes.\n\nk=6: b=15+1=16. yes.\n\nk=9: b=10+1=11. yes (10 <11).\n\nk=10: b=8+1=9. s=10 vs b=9. no.\n\nk=15: b=6+1=7. s=10>7. reject.\n\nk=18: b=5+1=6. 10>6.\n\nk=30: b=3+1=4. reject.\n\nk=45: b=2+1=3. reject.\n\nk=90: b=1+1=2. reject.\n\nThus, valid k's:1,2,3,5,6,9. So b=91,46,31,19,16,11.\n\nHmm, so starting to see that for each s, we get several b's. Now, the key is to tally how many times each b is generated by these combinations. For example, b=15 is obtained when s=6 with k=3 (b=15?), no wait earlier for s=6, k=3 gives b=11, no wait let me recheck:\n\nWait, when s=6, k=3:\n\nb=(30)/3 +1=10+1=11. So b=11. \n\nWait, for s=8 and k=4: b=14 +1=15.\n\nAh, yes, so different s and k can generate the same b. \n\nTherefore, our goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such pairs (s, k) is more than 10. \n\nTo do this, perhaps we can track counts for each b as we go through s and k pairs. \n\nAlternatively, let me note that for each s, the possible b's generated are (s(s-1)/k)+1 for each divisor k of s(s-1) where k < s (to ensure s < b). \n\nAlternatively, since each b corresponds to some s and k, perhaps we can see for each b, how many s's can contribute to it. \n\nAlternatively, let me proceed step by step, keeping track of counts for each b:\n\nStart with s=2:\n\n- b=3 (count=1)\n\ns=3:\n\n- b=4 (count becomes 1), b=7 (count=1)\n\ns=4:\n\n- b=5 (count=1), b=7 (now 2), b=13 (1)\n\nWait, for s=4:\n\nk=1 gives b=13, k=2 gives b=7, k=3 gives b=5 (since 12/3 +1=4+1=5). So yes.\n\nThus, after s=4:\n\nb=3:1; b=4:1; b=5:1; b=7:2; b=13:1\n\ns=5:\n\n- b=6 (count=1), b=11 (1), b=21 (1)\n\nAlso, s=5 gives b=6,11,21.\n\nPrevious counts updated:\n\nb=5:1; b=6:1; b=11:1; b=21:1; others as before.\n\ns=6:\n\n- b=7 (now 3), b=8 (1), b=11 (now 2), b=16 (1), b=31 (1)\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFor s=6:\n\nk=1: b=31 (new, count 1)\n\nk=2: b=16 (new, count 1)\n\nk=3: b=11 (now 2)\n\nk=5: b=7 (now 3)\n\nk=6 is rejected. \n\nThus, after s=6:\n\nb=7:3; b=8:1; b=11:2; b=16:1; b=31:1; others as before.\n\ns=7:\n\n- b=8 (now 2), b=9 (1), b=15 (1), b=22 (1), b=29 (1), b=43 (1)\n\nWait, s=7 gives:\n\nk=1:43 (new, count1)\n\nk=2:29 (new, count1)\n\nk=3:15 (new, count1)\n\nk=6:8 (now 2)\n\nThus:\n\nb=8:2; b=9:1; b=15:1; b=22:1; b=29:1; b=43:1.\n\ns=8:\n\n- b=9 (now 2), b=10 (1), b=15 (now 2), b=19 (1), b=25 (1), b=29: still 1?\n\nWait, s=8:\n\nk=1:57 (new)\n\nk=2:29 (already counted in previous steps? Wait s=8, k=2 gives b=(56)/2 +1=28+1=29. So yes, so b=29 gets another count. \n\nWait, s=8, k=2 gives b=29. Previously, s=7, k=2 also gave b=29. So now b=29 has count 2.\n\nSimilarly:\n\nk=4:15 (from s=8, k=4 gives b=14+1=15, so adding to previous count from s=7 (k=3 gave b=15). So b=15 becomes 2.\n\nk=7:9 (now 2)\n\nk= others give new b's:\n\nk=1:57 (1), k=4:15 (now 2), k=7:9 (now2), and also k=2 gives b=29 (now2).\n\nThus, after s=8:\n\nb=9:2; b=10:1; b=15:2; b=19:1; b=25:1; b=29:2; b=57:1.\n\nAlso, b=29 was already existing from s=7, so s=8 adds another to it, making its count 2.\n\nContinuing with s=9:\n\ns=9 gives b=10 (now 2), b=11 (now3?), b=13: ?\n\nWait let's see:\n\ns=9, k=1:73 (new, count1)\n\nk=2:37 (new)\n\nk=3:25 (count becomes 2: previous from s=8, k=4?)\n\nWait s=8's k=4 gave b=15, not 25. Wait s=9, k=3:\n\nb=(9*8)/3 +1=24+1=25 (so yes, so b=25 gets another count if it was already there. Previously, s=8 with k=1 gave b=57, k=2 gave 29, k=4 gave 15, etc. So b=25 is new except from s=9, k=3 and k= others? \n\nWait, proceeding step by step:\n\nFor s=9:\n\nk=1:73 (1)\n\nk=2: (72/2)+1=36+1=37 (1)\n\nk=3: (72/3)+1=24+1=25 (1)\n\nk=4: (72/4)+1=18+1=19 (count becomes 2: previously s=7 or s=8?)\n\nWait s=8's k=7 gave b=9, which is different. s=6 had k=6? Wait s=6's k=5 gave b=7; no. Wait, for s=8, k=7? Wait s=8 had k=7: yes, k=7 gives b=(56)/7 +1=8+1=9, so yes, so b=9 had counts from s=7 and s=8. So s=9, k=4 gives b=19, which was already from s=8, k= something?\n\nWait s=8, with s=8, k=4 gives b=15, so no. So b=19 was from s=8, k=7? Wait s=8, k=7: (56)/7 +1=8 +1=9. So no. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.\n\nWait when s=8 and k=7:\n\ns(s-1)=56, so 56 divided by 7 is 8. So b=8+1=9. Which is b=9, not 19. \n\nWait for s=9 and k=4:\n\nk=4 divides 72 (since 72/4=18). So b=18+1=19. So b=19 was first introduced here? Or was it introduced earlier?\n\nLooking back, s=7's k=6: s=7, k=6: s(s-1)=42 divided by6 is 7, so b=7+1=8. So no.\n\ns=6, k=6 is rejected. s=5, k=5? Not giving 19. \n\nThus, b=19 is first introduced here by s=9, k=4 (count=1). \n\nContinuing with s=9:\n\nk=5: 72/5 is 14.4, which is not integer. Wait s=9's divisors: k=5 divides 72? 72 divided by5 is 14.4, so no. Wait divisors of 72 are 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72. So k=5 is not a divisor. \n\nWait my mistake, I listed divisors earlier as 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72. So indeed, 5 is not a divisor. So k=6: \n\nk=6: 72/6=12, so b=13 (12+1=13). \n\nSo b=13: previously from s=4, k=1 (b=13). So now count becomes 2.\n\nk=8: 72/8=9, so b=10 (9+1=10). \n\nk=9: gives b= (72/9)+1=8+1=9, which would make s=9 vs b=9, which is invalid. \n\nk=12: gives 72/12=6 \u21d2 b=7. But s=9 >7, so invalid.\n\nThus, the valid b's for s=9 are:\n\nk=1:73 (1)\n\nk=2:37 (1)\n\nk=3:25 (1)\n\nk=4:19 (1)\n\nk=6:13 (now 2)\n\nk=8:10 (count becomes 2: s=9, k=8 gives b=10, which was previously introduced by s=10? Wait, no, s=9 is first to reach b=10? \n\nWait, s=9, k=8: b=10. So that's a new count for b=10. Previously, was there a b=10 before? \n\nLooking back, s=9 is the first to reach b=10. So b=10 gets count 1 here.\n\nWait, but let me retrace:\n\nAt s=9, k=8: b=10. Count for b=10 is 1.\n\nProceeding further:\n\nk=9 gives invalid.\n\nk=12 gives invalid.\n\nk=18: 72/18=4 \u21d2 b=5. s=9 vs b=5: invalid.\n\nk=24: 3 \u21d2 b=4. invalid.\n\nk=36:2 \u21d2 b=3. invalid.\n\nk=72:1 \u21d2 b=2. invalid.\n\nThus, valid contributions from s=9 are:\n\nb=73(1), 37(1),25(1),19(1),13(2),10(1).\n\nThus updating counts:\n\nb=10:1; b=13:2; b=19:1; b=25:1; b=37:1; b=73:1.\n\ns=10:\n\ns=10 gives:\n\nk=1:91 (1)\n\nk=2:46 (1)\n\nk=3:31 (1)\n\nk=5:19 (now 2)\n\nk=6:16 (now 2?)\n\nWait let's see:\n\nFor s=10:\n\nk=1: b=91 (1)\n\nk=2: (90/2)+1=45+1=46 (1)\n\nk=3: (90/3)+1=30+1=31 (1)\n\nk=5: (90/5)+1=18+1=19 (now 2)\n\nk=6: (90/6)+1=15+1=16 (previously from s=6, k=5 gave b=16, so now count 2)\n\nk=9: (90/9)+1=10+1=11 (previously from s=5, k=2 and s=6, k=3, so count would be 3? \n\nWait s=5, k=2 gives b=11 (from s=5, k=2: (20)/2 +1=10+1=11). s=6, k=3: gives b=11 (from s=6, k=3: 30/3 +1=10+1=11). So s=10, k=9 gives b=11 again, making count 3 for b=11.\n\nOther k's:\n\nk=10 would give b= (90/10)+1=9+1=10, but s=10 vs b=10 invalid.\n\nk=15: (90/15)+1=6+1=7. s=10>7 invalid.\n\nk=18: 5 \u21d2 b=6? 90/18=5, so b=6, s=10>6 invalid.\n\nk=30: 3 \u21d2 b=4. invalid.\n\nk=45:2 \u21d2 b=3. invalid.\n\nk=90:1 \u21d2 b=2. invalid.\n\nThus, the valid contributions for s=10:\n\nb=91(1),46(1),31(1),19(2),16(2),11(3).\n\nUpdating counts:\n\nb=11:3; b=16:2; b=19:2; b=31:1; b=46:1; b=91:1.\n\nContinuing this process further would take a lot of time, but perhaps we can see that certain b's are accumulating counts. For instance, b=7 has 3 counts from s=6 (k=5), and maybe more. Wait let's track the counts up to s=10, but maybe we can see by now which b's have the highest counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can see that the counts are accumulating in b's that are divisors or related to multiple s's.\n\nAlternatively, let me look for a b where the count exceeds 10. \n\nLooking at the counts up to s=10:\n\nWe can see that counts are still small, but let's see further. Let's try s=11 and s=12.\n\ns=11:\n\ns=11, s(s-1)=110. Divisors: 1,2,5,10,11,22,55,110.\n\nk=1: b=111 (1)\n\nk=2: 55+1=56 (1)\n\nk=5:22+1=23 (1)\n\nk=10:11+1=12 (1). s=11 vs b=12: valid (11 <12).\n\nk=11:10+1=11 (invalid since s=11 vs b=11)\n\nk=22:5 \u21d2 b=6. s=11>6 invalid.\n\nk=55:2 \u21d2 b=3 invalid.\n\nk=110:1 \u21d2 b=2 invalid.\n\nThus, valid b's:111,56,23,12.\n\nCount contributions:\n\nb=12:1; b=23:1; etc.\n\ns=11 might not contribute much yet.\n\ns=12:\n\ns=12, s(s-1)=132. Divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,11,12,22,33,44,66,132.\n\nk=1:133 (1)\n\nk=2:66+1=67 (1)\n\nk=3:44+1=45 (1)\n\nk=4:33+1=34 (1)\n\nk=6:22+1=23 (now 2)\n\nk=11:12+1=13 (now 3: previous counts from s=4,9?)\n\nWait let's see:\n\nk=11: (132)/11=12 \u21d2 b=13. \n\nPreviously, b=13 had count 2 from s=4 and s=9. Adding this, count becomes 3.\n\nk=12: (132/12)=11 \u21d2 b=12. s=12 vs b=12 invalid.\n\nk=22:6 \u21d2 b=7 (since 132/22=6 \u21d2 b=7). s=12 >7 invalid.\n\nk=33:4 \u21d2 b=5 invalid.\n\nk=44:3 \u21d2 b=4 invalid.\n\nk=66:2 \u21d2 b=3 invalid.\n\nk=132:1 \u21d2 b=2 invalid.\n\nThus contributions:\n\nb=133(1),67(1),45(1),34(1),23(2),13(3).\n\nThus, b=13 now has count 3 (from s=4,9,12).\n\nContinuing s=13:\n\ns=13, s(s-1)=156. Divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12,13,26,39,52,78,156.\n\nk=1:157 (1)\n\nk=2:78+1=79 (1)\n\nk=3:52+1=53 (1)\n\nk=4:39+1=40 (1)\n\nk=6:26+1=27 (1)\n\nk=12:13+1=14 (1)\n\nk=13:12+1=13 (invalid)\n\nk=26:6 \u21d2 b=7 (156/26=6 \u21d2 b=7). s=13>7 invalid.\n\nk=39:4 \u21d2 b=5.\n\nk=52:3 \u21d2 b=4.\n\nk=78:2 \u21d2 b=3.\n\nk=156:1 \u21d2 b=2.\n\nSo valid b's:157,79,53,40,27,14.\n\nAdding to counts:\n\nb=14:1; etc.\n\nHmm, still not many counts. \n\nContinuing to s=15:\n\nWait, maybe we need to go higher. Alternatively, notice that for b=36:\n\nWait, let me think of a different approach. Maybe find the minimal b where the number of divisors of s(s-1) for s up to b-1 gives enough counts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps b=25.\n\nWait, let me see for b=12:\n\nLooking back at previous counts, b=12 has 1.\n\nContinuing s=14:\n\ns=14, s(s-1)=14\u00d713=182. Divisors of 182: 1,2,7,13,14,26,91,182.\n\nk=1: b=183 (1)\n\nk=2:91+1=92 (1)\n\nk=7:26+1=27 (now 2)\n\nk=13:14+1=15 (now 3?)\n\nWait let me compute:\n\nk=13: (14\u00d713)/13 +1=14+1=15. So b=15, which had counts from previous steps. \n\nk=14:13+1=14 (invalid)\n\nk=26:7 \u21d2 b=8 (14 <8? No, 14>8, so invalid.\n\nk=91:2 \u21d2 b=3.\n\nk=182:1 \u21d2 b=2.\n\nThus contributions to b=15 (count would be previous 2 from s=8 and s=9, plus this one, so 3?), but need to track. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's too time-consuming to track each b's count manually. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nNotice that for each s, the number of divisors k of s(s-1) that are less than s contributes to different b's. The more factors s(s-1) has, the more contributions to various b's. \n\nTo have a b with more than 10 b-beautiful numbers, there must be many s's such that (s^2 -s) is divisible by (b-1). \n\nAlternatively, if we set k = b-1, then for each s, the condition is s(s-1) divisible by k=b-1. So for each b, the number of s is the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where s(s-1) divisible by (b-1).\n\nTherefore, if we can find b such that (b-1) has many factors, then there will be many s's that satisfy the divisibility condition.\n\nHence, perhaps choosing b-1 as a highly composite number would maximize the count. For example, if b-1 is 24 (so b=25), which has many divisors. Let's see.\n\nLet me try b=25:\n\nCompute the number of s between ceil(sqrt(25))=5 and 24 (since b-1=24). So s ranges from 5 to 24.\n\nFor each s in 5 to 24, check if s(s-1) divisible by 24.\n\nSo we need s(s-1) \u22610 mod 24.\n\nNote that s and s-1 are coprime, so one of them must be divisible by 3 and one divisible by 8, or other combinations.\n\nSince 24=3\u00d78.\n\nTherefore, either:\n\n- s \u22610 mod 3 and s \u22610 mod 8,\n\n- or s \u22610 mod 3 and s-1 \u22610 mod 8,\n\n- or s-1 \u22610 mod 3 and s \u22610 mod 8,\n\n- or s-1 \u22610 mod 3 and s-1 \u22610 mod 8,\n\nWait, more systematically, since 24 divides s(s-1), we need the product to have factors of 3 and 8 (since 24=3\u00d78). Since s and s-1 are coprime, one must be divisible by 3 and at least one must be divisible by 8, or one divisible by 24, etc.\n\nWait, actually, since 3 and 8 are coprime, the factors can be distributed between the two terms.\n\nSo either:\n\nCase1: 3 divides s and 8 divides s-1,\n\nCase2: 3 divides s-1 and 8 divides s,\n\nCase3: 3 divides s and 8 divides s,\n\nCase4: 3 divides s-1 and 8 divides s-1,\n\nBut since s and s-1 are coprime, Cases3 and 4 can't happen because in case3, both divisible by 3 and 8 would require common factors, but s and s-1 are coprime. Similarly for case4.\n\nTherefore, only cases1 and 2.\n\nSo:\n\nEither:\n\nCase1: s \u22610 mod3 and s \u22611 mod8,\n\nor\n\nCase2: s \u22611 mod3 and s\u22610 mod8.\n\nSo we can find s in 5 to24 satisfying either of these.\n\nLet me list s from 5 to24 and check:\n\nCase1: s \u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod8.\n\nFind s \u22611 mod8: possible s in 5-24 are 9,17 (since 1 mod8: 1,9,17,25 but 25 is beyond). \n\nCheck 9: 9 mod3=0, so yes. 9 is in 5-24. \n\n17:17 mod3= 2. Not 0 mod3. So no. \n\nThus, only s=9.\n\nCase2: s\u22611 mod3 and s \u22610 mod8.\n\ns\u22610 mod8: s=8,16,24 in the range 5-24.\n\nCheck s=8: 8 mod3=2 \u22601 mod3. \n\ns=16:16 mod3= 1 (since 15 divisible by3, so 16=15+1 \u21d21 mod3). So yes.\n\ns=24:24 mod3=0 \u22601. So only s=16.\n\nThus total s's are 9 and16. \n\nTherefore, for b=25, there are two s:9 and16.\n\nThus, only 2 numbers. Not enough.\n\nHmm, perhaps b=21?\n\nWait, let's try b=21 (b-1=20). \n\nThen s ranges from ceil(sqrt(21))=5 to20.\n\nCheck s from5-20: need s(s-1) divisible by20.\n\n20=4\u00d75. Since s and s-1 are coprime, one must be divisible by4 and the other by5.\n\nThus:\n\nEither:\n\nCase1: s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod5,\n\nor\n\nCase2: s\u22611 mod4 and s\u22610 mod5.\n\nLet me find s in 5-20.\n\nCase1:\n\ns \u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\nFind numbers divisible by4 and \u22611 mod5.\n\nNumbers divisible by4:4,8,12,16,20. From 5-20:8,12,16,20.\n\nCheck which of these \u22611 mod5:\n\n8 mod5=3 no,\n\n12 mod5=2 no,\n\n16 mod5=1 yes,\n\n20 mod5=0 no.\n\nThus s=16.\n\nCase2:\n\ns\u22611 mod4 and s\u22610 mod5.\n\nNumbers divisible by5 in 5-20:5,10,15,20.\n\nCheck which are \u22611 mod4:\n\n5 mod4=1 yes,\n\n10 mod4=2 no,\n\n15 mod4=3 no,\n\n20 mod4=0 no.\n\nThus s=5.\n\nThus total s=5 and16.\n\nThus two s's. Still low.\n\nHmm, perhaps b=36 (b-1=35). 35=5\u00d77. So need s(s-1) divisible by 35.\n\nThus, since coprime, one divisible by5 and the other by7.\n\nEither:\n\ns\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod7,\n\nor\n\ns\u22611 mod5 and s\u22610 mod7.\n\ns ranges from ceil(sqrt(36))=6 to35.\n\nCase1:\n\ns\u22610 mod5, s\u22611 mod7.\n\nFind s divisible by5 and \u22611 mod7.\n\nNumbers divisible by5 between6-35:10,15,20,25,30,35.\n\nCheck mod7:\n\n10 mod7=3,\n\n15 mod7=1 \u2192 yes,\n\n20 mod7=6,\n\n25 mod7=4,\n\n30 mod7=2,\n\n35 mod7=0.\n\nThus s=15.\n\nCase2:\n\ns\u22610 mod7, s\u22611 mod5.\n\nNumbers divisible by7 between6-35:7,14,21,28,35.\n\nCheck mod5:\n\n7 mod5=2,\n\n14 mod5=4,\n\n21 mod5=1 \u2192 yes,\n\n28 mod5=3,\n\n35 mod5=0.\n\nThus s=21.\n\nThus two s's:15 and21.\n\nStill low.\n\nHmm, maybe b= 24? Let me see b=24 (b-1=23). 23 is prime. Thus s(s-1) divisible by23. Since 23 is prime, either s\u22610 mod23 or s-1\u22610 mod23.\n\ns between ceil(sqrt(24))=5 and23.\n\nThus s=23 (since s=23 would be s-1=22 not divisible by23, but s=23 would make s divisible by23. Thus s=23. s-1=22, so 23\u00d722 divisible by23 \u21d2 yes.\n\nAlso s=1 would give s-1=0, but s starts at5. So only s=23.\n\nThus one s.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe b=20 (b-1=19, prime). Similar issue.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of b= 49 (b-1=48). 48 has many factors.\n\nLet me try b=49 (b-1=48).\n\ns ranges from ceil(sqrt(49))=7 to48.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by48.\n\n48=16\u00d73. So factors 16 and 3.\n\nSince s and s-1 are coprime, one must be divisible by16 and the other by3, or one divisible by48.\n\nLet me see.\n\nEither:\n\nCase1: s divisible by16 and s-1 divisible by3,\n\nCase2: s divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by16,\n\nCase3: s divisible by48,\n\nCase4: s-1 divisible by48,\n\nBut since s and s-1 are consecutive, case3 and4 would require s=48+1=49, but s is up to48, so:\n\nCase3: s=48 divisible by48. s=48 \u21d2 s-1=47. So s(s-1)=48\u00d747 divisible by48. Yes. So that's valid.\n\nCase4: s-1 divisible by48 \u21d2 s-1=48 \u21d2s=49, which is beyond the upper limit of48.\n\nThus cases1,2, and s=48.\n\nCase1: s divisible by16 and s-1 divisible by3.\n\ns divisible by16 in 7-48:16,32,48.\n\nCheck s-1 divisible by3:\n\n16-1=15 divisible by3 yes,\n\n32-1=31 not divisible by3,\n\n48-1=47 no.\n\nThus s=16,48.\n\nCase2: s divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by16.\n\ns-1 divisible by16 \u21d2 s-1=16,32 \u21d2 s=17,33,49 (but 49 is over)\n\nCheck s divisible by3:\n\n17:17 mod3=2 no,\n\n33 mod3=0 yes.\n\nThus s=33.\n\nThus total s's:16,33,48.\n\nThus three s's. Hmm, still low.\n\nHmm, perhaps b= 60? (b-1=59, prime). Not great.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps b= 25 is too low. Let me think of b= 121 (b-1=120). But this might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the initial counts and see when counts can reach over 10.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, note that for each s, the number of b's it can produce is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) less than s. Since each divisor k of s(s-1) less than s gives a distinct b via b=(s(s-1)/k)+1.\n\nTherefore, the total number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nThus, to find the minimal b with more than 10 solutions, we might need to find a b where (b-1) is a number that divides s(s-1) for many s in that range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set b-1 = 24 (as before, but had only two s), but maybe b-1=60, which has many factors.\n\nLet me try b=61 (b-1=60).\n\nThen s ranges from ceil(sqrt(61))=8 to60.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by60.\n\n60=4\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nThus, s(s-1) must be divisible by 4,3,5.\n\nSince s and s-1 are coprime:\n\nTo have divisibility by4,3,5:\n\nEither:\n\n- one of them divisible by4, one by3, and one by5 (but since two numbers, we need to distribute factors).\n\nAlternatively, since 4,3,5 are pairwise coprime, need:\n\nEither:\n\n- s divisible by4\u00d73=12 and s-1 divisible by5,\n\n- or s divisible by4\u00d75=20 and s-1 divisible by3,\n\n- or s divisible by3\u00d75=15 and s-1 divisible by4,\n\n- or one divisible by 60,\n\n- or any combination where the factors are split between s and s-1.\n\nThis is getting complex, but let's try to count possible s:\n\nCase1: s divisible by12 and s-1 divisible by5.\n\ns \u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\nFind s in 8-60.\n\nNumbers divisible by12:12,24,36,48,60.\n\nCheck mod5:\n\n12 mod5=2,\n\n24 mod5=4,\n\n36 mod5=1 \u2192 yes,\n\n48 mod5=3,\n\n60 mod5=0.\n\nSo s=36.\n\nCase2: s divisible by20 and s-1 divisible by3.\n\ns \u22610 mod20 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nNumbers divisible by20:20,40,60.\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n20 mod3=2,\n\n40 mod3=1 \u2192 yes,\n\n60 mod3=0.\n\nSo s=40.\n\nCase3: s divisible by15 and s-1 divisible by4.\n\ns\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\nDivisible by15:15,30,45,60.\n\nCheck mod4:\n\n15 mod4=3,\n\n30 mod4=2,\n\n45 mod4=1 \u2192 yes,\n\n60 mod4=0.\n\nThus s=45.\n\nCase4: s divisible by5 and s-1 divisible by12.\n\ns\u22611 mod12 and s\u22610 mod5.\n\nFind s \u22611 mod12 and divisible by5.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod12:13,25,37,49,61 (over).\n\nCheck divisibility by5:\n\n13: no,\n\n25:25 mod12=1 \u2192 yes,\n\n37: no,\n\n49: no,\n\n61: over.\n\nThus s=25.\n\nCase5: s divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by20.\n\ns\u22611 mod20 and divisible by3.\n\ns\u22611 mod20:21,41,61 (over).\n\nCheck divisibility by3:\n\n21 mod3=0 \u2192 yes,\n\n41 mod3=2,\n\n61 over.\n\nThus s=21.\n\nCase6: s divisible by4 and s-1 divisible by15.\n\ns\u22611 mod15 and divisible by4.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod15:16,31,46,61.\n\nDivisible by4:\n\n16 mod4=0 \u2192 yes,\n\n31 mod4=3,\n\n46 mod4=2,\n\n61 over.\n\nThus s=16.\n\nCase7: s divisible by60.\n\ns=60. Check s-1=59, which is within range. So s=60.\n\nThus total s's from the above cases:\n\n36,40,45,25,21,16,60.\n\nAlso, other cases may exist where factors are distributed differently. For instance:\n\nIf s divisible by4 and s-1 divisible by3\u00d75=15.\n\ns\u22611 mod15 and divisible by4.\n\nSimilar to case6: s=16 (already counted).\n\nAlternatively, s divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by4\u00d75=20.\n\nWhich is case5: s=21.\n\nAlternatively, s divisible by5 and s-1 divisible by3\u00d74=12: case4:25.\n\nThus, total s's so far:7.\n\nAdditionally, check if there are other combinations.\n\nFor example:\n\ns divisible by 3\u00d74=12 and s-1 divisible by5.\n\nWait that was case1.\n\nAlternatively, s divisible by5\u00d74=20 and s-1 divisible by3: case2.\n\nAlternatively, s divisible by5\u00d73=15 and s-1 divisible by4: case3.\n\nAnother case where s divisible by2 and something else? Not sure.\n\nBut perhaps also cases where s divisible by 3 and s-1 divisible by4 and 5 (i.e., divisible by20), which was case5.\n\nAlternatively, other distributions:\n\nFor instance, s divisible by 5 and s-1 divisible by 12 (case4:25).\n\nWait, are there other possibilities?\n\nLike s divisible by 2 and s-1 divisible by 30 (but 30 is big).\n\nAlternatively, s divisible by6 and s-1 divisible by10, but that would require 6 and10, but since coprime, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are more solutions where the factors are divided differently. Let me check.\n\nFor example:\n\nTo have s(s-1) divisible by 60, it's sufficient that:\n\n- s divisible by4, and s-1 divisible by 3\u00d75=15,\n\nor s divisible by3\u00d74=12 and s-1 divisible by5,\n\nor s divisible by5\u00d74=20 and s-1 divisible by3,\n\nor s divisible by3\u00d75=15 and s-1 divisible by4,\n\nor one divisible by60,\n\nor s divisible by 2 and s-1 divisible by 30, but s divisible by2 and s-1 divisible by30:\n\ns \u22611 mod30 and divisible by2.\n\nNumbers like 31,61,\u2026 but 31 is not divisible by2, 61 over.\n\nAlternatively, s divisible by30 and s-1 divisible by2:\n\ns divisible by30 and s even \u21d2 s divisible by30 and even \u21d2 divisible by60. So s=60, already counted.\n\nAnother case:\n\ns divisible by 5 and divisible by 3, so divisible by15, and s-1 divisible by4. Which is case3.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's no other cases.\n\nThus total s's are 7. Still not enough.\n\nHmm, maybe b= 121? Let's try b=121 (b-1=120).\n\ns ranges from 11 to120.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by120.\n\n120=8\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nThus, need factors 8,3,5 distributed between s and s-1.\n\nThis could have more solutions.\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming. Maybe the minimal b is 121? Or perhaps my approach is wrong.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the least integer b \u2265 2 for which there are more than ten b-beautiful integers\".\n\nPerhaps going back to the earlier examples, the counts for b= 12, let me see:\n\nWait when we were counting up to s=10, for example, b=7 had count 3, b=11 had count 3, b=13 had 2, etc.\n\nContinuing further, perhaps b= 25, when s= 15 (s=15 gives b=25? Let me see:\n\nFor s=15:\n\ns(s-1)=15\u00d714=210.\n\nDivisors of210:1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15,21,30,35,42,70,105,210.\n\nk must be <15.\n\nThus, possible k's:\n\n1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14.\n\nThus:\n\nk=1: b=211.\n\nk=2:105+1=106.\n\nk=3:70+1=71.\n\nk=5:42+1=43.\n\nk=6:35+1=36.\n\nk=7:30+1=31.\n\nk=10:21+1=22.\n\nk=14:15+1=16.\n\nThus contributing to b=36 (count?), etc.\n\nBut even so, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that for each s, the number of b's it can contribute is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) less than s.\n\nTherefore, the total number of b-beautiful numbers for a b is the number of s's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1). To have over 10 such s's for a b.\n\nTo maximize the count, b-1 should have many divisors so that many s's satisfy the divisibility.\n\nThe number of such s's is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s \u22610 or 1 mod d for some divisor d of (b-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the optimal b-1 is a factorial number or highly composite number. Let's try b-1=24 (b=25) had 2 solutions. b-1=60 (b=61) had 7 solutions. Maybe b-1= 120 (b=121) could have many.\n\nAlternatively, let's try b= 60 (b-1=59, prime). No.\n\nAlternatively, b= 24 (b-1=23). No.\n\nAlternatively, b= 36 (b-1=35). 35=5\u00d77. Let me see for b=36:\n\ns ranges from6 to35.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by35.\n\nThus, s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod7,\n\nor s\u22611 mod5 and s\u22610 mod7.\n\nWhich gives:\n\nCase1:\n\ns divisible by5, s\u22611 mod7.\n\ns divisible by5:5,10,15,20,25,30,35.\n\nCheck mod7:\n\n5 mod7=5,\n\n10 mod7=3,\n\n15 mod7=1 \u2192 yes,\n\n20 mod7=6,\n\n25 mod7=4,\n\n30 mod7=2,\n\n35 mod7=0.\n\nThus s=15.\n\nCase2:\n\ns divisible by7, s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns divisible by7:7,14,21,28,35.\n\nCheck mod5:\n\n7 mod5=2,\n\n14 mod5=4,\n\n21 mod5=1 \u2192 yes,\n\n28 mod5=3,\n\n35 mod5=0.\n\nThus s=21.\n\nThus total s=15 and21. Two solutions.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 120 (b-1=119). 119=7\u00d717.\n\nThus, s(s-1) divisible by7\u00d717.\n\nThus, either s divisible by7 and s-1 divisible by17,\n\nor s divisible by17 and s-1 divisible by7,\n\nor s divisible by119.\n\ns between 11 and119.\n\nCase1: s divisible by7 and s-1 divisible by17.\n\ns \u22611 mod17 and divisible by7.\n\nNumbers divisible by7:7,14,21,28,... up to119.\n\nFind s=17k+1 divisible by7.\n\n17k+1 \u22610 mod7 \u21d217k \u2261-1 mod7 \u21d23k\u22616 mod7 \u21d2k\u22612 mod7.\n\nThus k=2,9,16,..., but s must be \u2264119.\n\nFor k=2: s=17\u00d72+1=35.\n\n35 divisible by7? 35/7=5 yes.\n\nNext k=9:17\u00d79+1=154>119.\n\nThus only s=35.\n\nCase2: s divisible by17 and s-1 divisible by7.\n\ns \u22611 mod7 and divisible by17.\n\nFind s=17m,\n\n17m \u22611 mod7 \u21d217m \u22613m \u22611 mod7 \u21d23m\u22611 \u21d2m\u22615 mod7.\n\nThus m=5,12,... \n\n17\u00d75=85,\n\n17\u00d712=204>119.\n\nThus s=85.\n\nCase3: s divisible by119 \u21d2 s=119.\n\nCheck s-1=118, which is within range.

Maybe the minimal b is 121, but I need another approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original equation:\n\nWe have n = d1*b + d0,\n\nand d1 + d0 = sqrt(n),\n\nand d0 = sqrt(n) - d1,\n\nso substituting:\n\nn = d1*b + (sqrt(n) - d1)\n\nSo,\n\nsqrt(n) = d1 + d0,\n\nand\n\nn = d1*b + d0 = d1*b + (sqrt(n) - d1)\n\nLet me set s = sqrt(n),\n\nthen,\n\ns = d1 + d0,\n\nand,\n\ns\u00b2 = d1*b + (s - d1),\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = d1*(b -1),\n\nso,\n\nd1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1).\n\nWe need d1 to be an integer between 1 and b-1,\n\nand d0 = s - d1 must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nAdditionally, since n must be a two-digit number in base b, n must be between b and b\u00b2 -1, so s = sqrt(n) must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) < b.\n\nThus, s is an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1.\n\nThus, for each b, the number of b-beautiful numbers is the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), and the resulting d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d0 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nNow, the key insight might be that for each s, the equation defines b in terms of s and d1:\n\nb = 1 + (s\u00b2 - s)/d1.\n\nTherefore, for each s and each divisor d1 of (s\u00b2 - s) between 1 and s (since d0 = s - d1 must be non-negative), we get a corresponding b.\n\nThus, for a given b, the number of solutions is the number of pairs (s, d1) such that:\n\n1. s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\n2. d1 divides (s\u00b2 - s).\n\n3. b = 1 + (s\u00b2 - s)/d1.\n\n4. d1 is between 1 and s.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the count is the number of s in the range where (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), which is the same as (b-1) divides (s\u00b2 - s).\n\nTherefore, the number of such s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s(s - 1) \u22610 mod (b -1).\n\nTo maximize this count, we need b-1 to divide many s(s-1) for s in that range.\n\nThe number of such s is equal to the number of solutions to s \u22610 or 1 mod d for each divisor d of (b-1).\n\nThis is similar to counting the number of s in the range that are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo various factors of (b-1).\n\nTo maximize this count, b-1 should have many small factors so that there are multiple congruence conditions that can be satisfied.\n\nThe number 12 is highly composite (factors 1,2,3,4,6,12). Let me try b=13 (b-1=12).\n\ns ranges from4 to12.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by12.\n\n12=3\u00d74.\n\nThus, s(s-1) must be divisible by3 and4.\n\nPossible cases:\n\nEither:\n\n- s divisible by4, s-1 divisible by3,\n\n- s divisible by3, s-1 divisible by4,\n\n- s divisible by12,\n\n- s divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by4,\n\nSame as:\n\nCase1: s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3,\n\nor\n\nCase2: s\u22611 mod4 and s\u22610 mod3,\n\nor\n\nCase3: s\u22610 mod12.\n\nCase1:\n\ns\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nFind s in4-12:\n\nNumbers divisible by4:4,8,12.\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n4 mod3=1 \u2192 yes,\n\n8 mod3=2,\n\n12 mod3=0.\n\nThus s=4.\n\nCase2:\n\ns\u22611 mod4 and divisible by3.\n\nNumbers divisible by3:3,6,9,12.\n\nIn the range 4-12:\n\n6,9,12.\n\nCheck mod4:\n\n6 mod4=2,\n\n9 mod4=1 \u2192 yes,\n\n12 mod4=0.\n\nThus s=9.\n\nCase3:\n\ns divisible by12 \u21d2 s=12.\n\nThus s=4,9,12.\n\nThus three solutions for b=13.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 25 (b-1=24).\n\nEarlier, we saw 2 solutions.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the minimal b is 121, but I need to find another way.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement's example: 81 is 13-eautiful because 81=63_{13}, and 6+3=9=sqrt(81). Here, s=9, and b=13. So for s=9, b=13 is a solution.\n\nLooking at s=9:\n\ns=9 has divisors of s(s-1)=72: 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72.\n\nThe possible k's (d1) less than s=9 are1,2,3,4,6,8.\n\nThus, for each of these k's:\n\nb = (72/k)+1.\n\nThus:\n\nk=1 \u21d2 b=73,\n\nk=2 \u21d237,\n\nk=3 \u21d225,\n\nk=4 \u21d219,\n\nk=6 \u21d213,\n\nk=8 \u21d210.\n\nThus, s=9 contributes to b=73,37,25,19,13,10.\n\nSimilarly, each s contributes to several b's.\n\nTo find the minimal b with over 10 solutions, we need a b that is generated by many s's.\n\nLooking for b= 13:\n\nFrom s=9 (k=6), and perhaps other s's.\n\nSimilarly, for b=13, the count was 2 (from s=4 and s=9? Wait, earlier for b=13, s=9 and s=4? No, let me check.\n\nWait when b=13:\n\nWe need s in [4,12].\n\ns(s-1) must be divisible by12 (since b-1=12).\n\nWhich we found s=4,9,12.\n\nThus three solutions. So count 3.\n\nHmm.\n\nTrying b= 36 (b-1=35):\n\nEarlier had 2 solutions.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of b= 24:\n\nb-1=23 (prime). So only s=23 and s=24?

The problem asks for more than ten.\n\nThus, need to try b= 122 (b-1=121, prime). Only s=121. Thus one solution.\n\nb= 123 (b-1=122=2\u00d761). s ranges from11 to122.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by122.\n\n122=2\u00d761.\n\nThus either s divisible by2 and s-1 divisible by61,\n\nor s divisible by61 and s-1 divisible by2.\n\nCase1:\n\ns divisible by2, s-1 divisible by61.\n\ns=61k+1 divisible by2.\n\n61k+1 even \u21d261k must be odd \u21d2k odd.\n\nk=1 \u21d262,\n\nk=3 \u21d2184>122.\n\nThus s=62.\n\nCase2:\n\ns divisible by61 and s-1 divisible by2.\n\ns=61m,\n\n61m-1 divisible by2 \u21d261m must be odd \u21d2m odd.\n\nm=1 \u21d261,\n\nm=3 \u21d2183>122.\n\nThus s=61.\n\nThus two solutions:61 and62.\n\nThus b=123 has two solutions.\n\nHmm.\n\nNext, b= 120 (b-1=119=7\u00d717).

Two.\n\nHmm.\n\nb= 121 had exactly 10.\n\nNext is b= 252? No.\n\nWait, perhaps b= 252 has more.\n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 210 (b-1=209=11\u00d719).\n\nThus s(s-1) divisible by209.\n\nThus s divisible by11 and s-1 divisible by19,\n\nor s divisible by19 and s-1 divisible by11.\n\nCase1:\n\ns divisible by11, s-1 divisible by19.\n\ns=19k+1 divisible by11.\n\n19k+1 \u22610 mod11 \u21d219k\u2261-1 mod11 \u21d28k\u226110 mod11 \u21d28k\u226110 \u21d2 multiply both sides by inverse of8 mod11 (which is7 since8\u00d77=56\u22611 mod11).\n\nThus k\u226110\u00d77=70\u22614 mod11.\n\nThus k=4,15,\u2026 \n\ns=19\u00d74+1=77,\n\n19\u00d715+1=286>210.\n\nThus s=77.\n\nCase2:\n\ns divisible by19, s-1 divisible by11.\n\ns=19m,\n\n19m\u22611 mod11 \u21d219m\u22618m\u22611 mod11 \u21d28m\u22611 \u21d2m\u2261 inverse of8 mod11 is7 \u21d2m\u22617 mod11.\n\nm=7 \u21d2133,\n\nm=18 \u21d2342>210.\n\nThus s=133.\n\nThus total two solutions.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm, perhaps the next b after 121 with more than 10 is b= 252? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps b= 360 (b-1=359 prime). One solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong and the minimal b is 121, but the problem says \"more than ten\". So maybe the next possible is b= 252 with 2? No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed a case for b=121.\n\nWait let me recount for b=121:\n\ns=16,21,25,40,76,81,96,100,105,120. That's 10 numbers.\n\nWait wait, s= 105 is one, s=100 is another, s= 76, etc.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait s= 80:\n\nCheck if s=80 is valid.\n\ns=80, s-1=79.\n\nNeed s(s-1)=80\u00d779 divisible by 120.\n\nCompute 80\u00d779=6320.\n\n6320 divided by120:6320/120=52.666..., which is not integer. Thus not divisible.\n\nThus s=80 is not counted.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait s= 30:\n\n30\u00d729=870. 870/120=7.25 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait s= 60:\n\n60\u00d759=3540. 3540/120=29.5 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait s= 48:\n\n48\u00d747=2256. 2256/120=18.8 \u2192 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait s= 105 is valid:\n\n105\u00d7104=10920. 10920/120=91 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns= 100:100\u00d799=9900. 9900/120=82.5 \u2192 no. Wait, 9900 divided by120 is 82.5? Wait no, 120\u00d782=9840, plus 60 is 9900 \u21d2 82.5. Thus not divisible. Thus s=100 is not valid.\n\nWait wait, I must have made a mistake here.\n\nWait s=100:\n\ns(s-1)=100\u00d799=9900.\n\nb-1=120,\n\n9900 divided by120 is 9900/120=82.5, which is not integer. Thus s=100 is not valid.\n\nOh no! I made a mistake earlier. So s=100 is not valid. So I overcounted.\n\nThus need to recalculate.\n\nLet me recalculate for b=121:\n\ns must satisfy s(s-1) divisible by120.\n\nThus:\n\nFor s=16:\n\n16\u00d715=240 \u21d2240/120=2 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=21:\n\n21\u00d720=420 \u21d2420/120=3.5 \u21d2 no. So s=21 is invalid.\n\nWait this is a problem. Earlier I thought s=21 was valid, but 21\u00d720=420, which divided by120 gives 3.5 \u21d2 not integer. Thus s=21 is invalid.\n\nThus my previous count was wrong.\n\nThis is an error. Need to recalculate.\n\nLet me start over for b=121 (b-1=120).\n\ns ranges from11 to120.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by120.\n\nThus s(s-1) mod120=0.\n\nLet me consider s(s-1) divisible by8,3,5.\n\nThus conditions:\n\n- divisible by8: either s or s-1 divisible by8,\n\n- divisible by3: either s or s-1 divisible by3,\n\n- divisible by5: either s or s-1 divisible by5.\n\nThus, the possible cases are combinations where:\n\nFor 8: s \u22610 or1 mod8,\n\nFor3: s\u22610 or1 mod3,\n\nFor5: s\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, using Chinese Remainder Theorem, we need to find s in [11,120] that meet:\n\n( s \u22610 or1 mod8 ) AND ( s\u22610 or1 mod3 ) AND ( s\u22610 or1 mod5 ).\n\nThis can get complex, but perhaps it's better to find all s in that range where s(s-1) divisible by 120.\n\nAlternatively, list all s such that s \u22610 or1 mod lcm(8,3,5)=120? No, but need combinations.\n\nAlternatively, consider multiples of the factors.\n\nAlternatively, list all s between11 and120 where s or s-1 is divisible by8,3,5 respectively.\n\nBut this is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the earlier cases:\n\nCase1: s divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by15 (15=3\u00d75).\n\ns=16: s divisible by8, s-1=15 divisible by15 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=76: divisible by4 but not 8? 76 divided by8 is9.5 \u21d2 no. Wait 76 is divisible by4 but not 8.\n\nWait earlier mistake:\n\nCase4: s divisible by15 and s-1 divisible by8.\n\ns=105: 105 divisible by15, s-1=104 divisible by8 \u21d2104/8=13 \u21d2 yes.\n\nThus s=105 is valid.\n\nCase5: s divisible by120 \u21d2 s=120 \u21d2 yes.\n\nCase2: s divisible by24 and s-1 divisible by5.\n\ns=96: divisible by24 (24\u00d74=96), s-1=95 divisible by5 \u21d2 yes.\n\nCase3: s divisible by40 and s-1 divisible by3.\n\ns=40: divisible by40, s-1=39 divisible by3 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=100: divisible by40? 100/40=2.5 \u21d2 no. Thus not.\n\nWait 40\u00d72.5=100, so no. Thus s=100 is not divisible by40.\n\nThus s=40 and s=?\n\nWait s= 80 divisible by40? s=80.\n\ns=80: divisible by40, s-1=79 divisible by3? 79/3\u224826.333 \u21d2 no. Thus no.\n\nThus only s=40.\n\nCase6: s divisible by5 and s-1 divisible by24.\n\ns=25: divisible by5, s-1=24 divisible by24 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns= 25: yes.\n\ns= 25\u00d72+1=51? Wait no, need s divisible by5 and s-1 divisible by24.\n\nThus s=24k+1 divisible by5.\n\nk=1:25,\n\nk=6:24\u00d76+1=145,\n\nk=11:265>120.\n\nThus s=25 and145 (over).\n\nThus s=25.\n\nCase7: s divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by40.\n\ns=81: divisible by3, s-1=80 divisible by40 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns= 81: yes.\n\ns= 80+40=121, which is the upper limit, but s must be <121 \u21d2 s=121 is excluded.\n\nThus s=81.\n\nCase8: s divisible by15 and s-1 divisible by8 (s=105).\n\nCase9: s divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by15 \u21d2 s=16.\n\nAdditionally:\n\ns divisible by5 and s-1 divisible by24 \u21d2 s=25.\n\ns divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by40 \u21d2 s=81.\n\ns divisible by24 and s-1 divisible by5 \u21d2 s=96.\n\ns divisible by40 and s-1 divisible by3 \u21d2 s=40.\n\ns divisible by15 and s-1 divisible by8 \u21d2 s=105.\n\ns divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by15 \u21d2 s=16.\n\ns divisible by120 \u21d2 s=120.\n\nAny others?\n\nCase10: s divisible by 3\u00d75=15 and s-1 divisible by8 (s=105).\n\nCase11: s divisible by 3\u00d78=24 and s-1 divisible by5 (s=96).\n\nCase12: s divisible by 5\u00d78=40 and s-1 divisible by3 (s=40).\n\nCase13: s divisible by 2\u00d73\u00d75=30 and s-1 divisible by4.\n\ns divisible by30, s-1 divisible by4.\n\ns=30k,\n\n30k \u22611 mod4 \u21d230k mod4=2k \u21d22k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2 no solution.\n\nThus no.\n\nCase14: s divisible by4 and s-1 divisible by3\u00d75\u00d7something.\n\nWait s divisible by4 and s-1 divisible by15:\n\ns=16 (divisible by8, which is a multiple of4), s= 76 divisible by4,\n\nCheck s=76:\n\n76 divisible by4 yes,\n\ns-1=75 divisible by15 yes.\n\nThus s=76.\n\nThus adding s=76.\n\nSimilarly s= 76:\n\n76\u00d775=5700,\n\n5700/120=47.5 \u21d2 no.\n\nWait 5700 divided by120=47.5 \u21d2 not integer.\n\nThus this is not valid. Wait mistake.\n\nWait s=76:\n\ns(s-1)=76\u00d775=5700.\n\n5700 divided by120=47.5 \u21d2 not integer. Thus invalid.\n\nHmm, thus my mistake again. Thus s=76 is not valid.\n\nThus need to check validity.\n\nFor s=76:\n\ns should be divisible by4 and s-1 divisible by15.\n\n76 divisible by4: yes,\n\n75 divisible by15: yes.\n\nThus s(s-1)=76\u00d775 divisible by4 and15,\n\nbut 4\u00d715=60, so divisible by60,\n\nbut 120 requires divisible by8\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nThus need additionally divisible by8 or 2\u00d74.\n\nWait 76 is divisible by4 but not 8. Thus 76\u00d775 divisible by 8?\n\n76 is divisible by4 but not8, so total factors of2: 76 has 2^2, 75 has 3\u00d75^2 \u21d2 total 2^2 \u21d2 not divisible by8.\n\nThus 76\u00d775 is divisible by 4\u00d715=60 but not by 8\u00d73\u00d75=120 \u21d2 thus not divisible by120.\n\nThus s=76 is invalid.\n\nThus back to the drawing board.\n\nThus only valid s's are:\n\ns=16 (16\u00d715=240 divisible by120:240/120=2 \u21d2 yes),\n\ns=25 (25\u00d724=600 \u21d2600/120=5 \u21d2 yes),\n\ns=40 (40\u00d739=1560 \u21d21560/120=13 \u21d2 yes),\n\ns=81 (81\u00d780=6480 \u21d26480/120=54 \u21d2 yes),\n\ns=96 (96\u00d795=9120 \u21d29120/120=76 \u21d2 yes),\n\ns=105 (105\u00d7104=10920 \u21d210920/120=91 \u21d2 yes),\n\ns=120 (120\u00d7119=14280 \u21d214280/120=119 \u21d2 yes).\n\nThus total s's:16,25,40,81,96,105,120. That's7.\n\nHmm, thus b=121 has 7 solutions.\n\nHmm. I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I need to consider that the minimal b is 121, but the problem states \"more than ten\". \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps. \n\nWait let me think of another approach. The number of solutions for a given b is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that can be written as s or s-1 for some s in the valid range. \n\nAlternatively, since the equation is s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1), the number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] is equal to the number of integers s in that interval such that s \u22610 or1 mod d for each prime factor of (b-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121 with7, then next is b= 252?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121 but the count is actually higher.\n\nWait let me try b= 252:\n\nb-1=251 (prime). So only s=251. Thus one solution.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider b= 60 (b-1=59). One.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 120:\n\nb=120, b-1=119=7\u00d717.\n\ns from11 to119.\n\ns(s-1) divisible by119.\n\nThus s\u22610 or1 mod7 and mod17.\n\nThus s\u22610 or1 mod7 and s\u22610 or1 mod17.\n\nThus four cases:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod7 and s\u22610 mod17 \u21d2 s divisible by119,\n\n2. s\u22610 mod7 and s\u22611 mod17,\n\n3. s\u22611 mod7 and s\u22610 mod17,\n\n4. s\u22611 mod7 and s\u22611 mod17.\n\nCase1: s divisible by119 \u21d2 s=119.\n\nCase2: s divisible by7, s\u22611 mod17.\n\ns=7k,\n\n7k\u22611 mod17 \u21d27k\u22611 \u21d2k\u2261 inverse of7 mod17. 7\u00d75=35\u22611 mod17 \u21d2k\u22615 mod17.\n\nThus k=5 \u21d235,\n\nk=22 \u21d2154>119.\n\nThus s=35.\n\nCase3: s divisible by17, s\u22611 mod7.\n\ns=17m,\n\n17m\u22611 mod7 \u21d217m\u22613m\u22611 \u21d2m\u22615 mod7.\n\nm=5 \u21d285,\n\nm=12 \u21d2204>119.\n\nThus s=85.\n\nCase4: s\u22611 mod7 and s\u22611 mod17 \u21d2s\u22611 mod119 \u21d2s=1 mod119 \u21d2 s=119+1>119.

It seems challenging to find a b with more than ten solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved with a different approach.\n\nLet me revisit the equation:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(n),\n\nand n = d1*b + d0.\n\nSubstitute sqrt(n) = d1 + d0,\n\nso,\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0,\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\nd1^2 + 2d1d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0,\n\nthen,\n\nd1^2 + (2d0 - b)d1 + d0^2 - d0 =0.\n\nThis is a quadratic in d1. For d1 to be integer, discriminant must be perfect square:\n\n[(2d0 - b)^2 -4*(d0^2 - d0)] must be a perfect square.\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n(4d0\u00b2 -4b d0 +b\u00b2) -4d0\u00b2 +4d0 = -4b d0 +b\u00b2 +4d0 = b\u00b2 -4d0(b-1).\n\nThis must be a perfect square.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, rearranging the equation:\n\nd1*b = (d1 + d0)^2 - d0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nb = [(d1 + d0)^2 - d0]/d1 = (d1 + d0)^2/d1 - d0/d1.\n\nThis expression must be integer.\n\nAlternatively, let me make substitution s =d1 +d0,\n\nthen,\n\nb = (s\u00b2 - d0)/d1 = s\u00b2/(d1) - d0/d1.\n\nSince d0 = s -d1,\n\nthen,\n\nb = s\u00b2/d1 - (s -d1)/d1 = (s\u00b2 -s +d1)/d1 = (s(s-1))/d1 +1.\n\nThus,\n\nb = [s(s-1)/d1] +1,\n\nwhich is what we had earlier.\n\nThus, for each pair (s, d1) where d1 divides s(s-1), and d1 is between 1 and s (since d0 =s -d1 \u22650),\n\nthen b is given by the above formula.\n\nThus the number of b-beautiful numbers for a given b is the number of pairs (s, d1) such that:\n\n1. ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 s \u2264 b-1,\n\n2. d1 divides s(s-1),\n\n3. d1 is between1 and s,\n\n4. b = [s(s-1)/d1] +1.\n\nThus, for each s in the range, the number of valid d1 divisors of s(s-1) between1 and s gives the number of contributions to b.\n\nTherefore, the total number of b-beautiful numbers for a given b is the sum over s from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1 of the number of divisors of s(s-1) between1 and s.\n\nThus, to find the minimal b where this sum exceeds10.\n\nTo find this, we can note that for each s, the number of divisors of s(s-1) less than or equal to s is roughly proportional to the number of divisors of s(s-1).\n\nThus, the more divisors s(s-1) has, the more contributions it can give.\n\nThus, to maximize the count, we should look for b such that many s near sqrt(b) have many divisors.\n\nBut since s(s-1) is two consecutive numbers, which are coprime, their factors are distributed between them.\n\nThus, the number of divisors of s(s-1) is \u03c4(s)*\u03c4(s-1), where \u03c4 is the divisor function.\n\nThus, to maximize the number of divisors, s and s-1 should be highly composite numbers.\n\nFor example, s=6 and s-1=5 (\u03c4(5)=2, \u03c4(6)=4 \u21d2 total 8 divisors).\n\ns=8 and s-1=7 (\u03c4(7)=2, \u03c4(8)=4 \u21d2 total8).\n\ns=9 and s-1=8 (\u03c4(9)=3, \u03c4(8)=4 \u21d2 total12).\n\ns=10 and s-1=9 (\u03c4(10)=4, \u03c4(9)=3 \u21d2 total12).\n\ns=12 and s-1=11 (\u03c4(11)=2, \u03c4(12)=6 \u21d2 total12).\n\ns=16 and s-1=15 (\u03c4(16)=5, \u03c4(15)=4 \u21d220).\n\ns=18 and s-1=17 (\u03c4(17)=2, \u03c4(18)=6 \u21d212).\n\ns=24 and s-1=23 (\u03c4(23)=2, \u03c4(24)=8 \u21d216).\n\ns=25 and s-1=24 (\u03c4(24)=8, \u03c4(25)=3 \u21d224).\n\nThus, the pairs with high divisor counts:\n\ns=24 and s-1=23 (16),\n\ns=25 and s-1=24 (24),\n\ns=16 and s-1=15 (20).\n\nThus, choosing b such that these s's can contribute.\n\nFor example, s=24 contributes to b= [24\u00d723/d1]+1 for d1 dividing 24\u00d723=552 and d1<=24.\n\nThe number of such d1's is the number of divisors of 552 less than or equal to24.\n\n552 factors: 2^3\u00d73\u00d723.\n\nDivisors up to24:\n\n1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24.\n\nThus8 divisors.\n\nThus s=24 contributes to8 b's.\n\nSimilarly, s=25 contributes to divisors of 25\u00d724=600 up to25.\n\n600=2^3\u00d73\u00d75^2.\n\nDivisors up to25:\n\n1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,25.\n\nThus13 divisors.\n\nThus s=25 contributes to13 b's.\n\nSimilarly, s=16: divisors of 16\u00d715=240 up to16.\n\n240=2^4\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nDivisors up to16:\n\n1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,16.\n\nThus11 divisors.\n\nThus s=16 contributes to11 b's.\n\nThus, if we can find a b in the ranges covered by these s's such that it is counted multiple times.\n\nFor instance, the number24 can be part of multiple s's.\n\nLet me consider b= 121:\n\ns=24 would contribute to b= [24\u00d723/d1]+1.\n\nFor d1=24:\n\nb= (552/24)+1=23+1=24.\n\nThus s=24 and d1=24 would give b=24+1=25? Wait no:\n\nWait for s=24 and d1=24:\n\nb=(24\u00d723)/24 +1=23+1=24.\n\nThus s=24 contributes to b=24, but s must be less than b. Since s=24 and b=24, it's invalid.\n\nThus d1 must be less than24.\n\nThus s=24 can contribute to b's up to (24\u00d723)/1 +1=553.\n\nThus, b=24+1=25 is one of them.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nPerhaps the minimal b where the count exceeds10 is b= 25.\n\nWait for b=25:\n\nThe number of b-beautiful numbers is the number of s in [5,24] such that s(s-1) divisible by24.\n\nAs earlier, there were three solutions:9,16,24.\n\nThus count is3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal b is 121 with7.\n\nHmm. I might have to conclude that the minimal b is 121 but the problem states \"more than ten\", so perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait let me check another b:\n\nTake b= 120:\n\ns ranges from11 to119.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by119=7\u00d717.\n\nThus s divisible by7 or17, and s-1 divisible by the other.\n\nAs before:\n\ns=15 (no, 15\u00d714 divisible by119? 210/119=1.76 \u21d2 no).\n\nWait:\n\ns divisible by7 and s-1 divisible by17 \u21d2 s=35 (35-1=34 not divisible by17 \u21d2 no).\n\nWait earlier calculation for b=120 had three solutions. Thus not enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait let me try b= 252:\n\nb-1=251, prime \u21d2 only s=251 \u21d2 one.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 360 (b-1=359 prime). One.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 121, and the problem might accept 10 as \"more than ten\" but no, it says \"more than ten\".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the original problem statement.\n\nWait the example given is 81 is 13-eautiful because 81=63_{13} (6*13+3=81), and 6+3=9=sqrt(81).\n\nThus s=9, and b=13.\n\nFor b=13, s=9 gives a valid solution.\n\nSimilarly, for s=9, the possible b's are:\n\ns=9: divisors of72 are1,2,3,4,6,8,9, etc. So for each divisor d1 <9:\n\nk=1 \u21d2 b=72/1 +1=73,\n\nk=2 \u21d237,\n\nk=3\u21d225,\n\nk=4\u21d219,\n\nk=6\u21d213,\n\nk=8\u21d210.\n\nThus for b=13, s=9 contributes one solution.\n\nAdditionally, what other s's contribute to b=13?\n\ns must satisfy s(s-1) divisible by12 (b-1=12).\n\nThus s=4,9,12.\n\ns=4: gives b= (4\u00d73)/d1 +1.\n\nFor d1 dividing12 and <=4:\n\nd1=1,2,3,4.\n\nThus:\n\nd1=1 \u21d2b=12+1=13,\n\nd1=2 \u21d26+1=7,\n\nd1=3 \u21d24+1=5,\n\nd1=4 \u21d23+1=4.\n\nThus for s=4 and d1=1 \u21d2 contributes to b=13.\n\nThus b=13 has two solutions: s=4 and s=9.\n\nThus count=2.\n\nThus, to find a b with count>10, let's think of b= 25:\n\ns=5,6,...24.\n\nFor s=16, which contributes to several b's.\n\nWait, but difficult.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 121, but the problem might have a different approach.\n\nWait let me think differently:\n\nThe equation is s^2 = d1*b + d0, and s = d1 +d0.\n\nThus substituting d0 = s - d1,\n\ns^2 = d1*b + (s - d1),\n\nso,\n\ns^2 -s = d1*(b-1).\n\nThus, for each b, the number of solutions is the number of s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 such that (s^2 - s) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nThus, for the count to be greater than10, the number of such s must be >10.\n\nTo have many s's, the number (b-1) must divide many s(s-1) for s in that interval.\n\nThus, if we choose b-1 to be a divisor of many s(s-1) terms.\n\nThe most likely candidate is b-1=24 (divisors 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24). Let's see for b=25:\n\ns from5 to24.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by24.\n\nThus s(s-1) divisible by24.\n\nWhich occurs when:\n\nEither:\n\n- s divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by3,\n\n- s divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by8,\n\n- s divisible by6 and s-1 divisible by4,\n\n- etc.\n\nLet me compute all s between5-24 where s(s-1) divisible by24.\n\nCompute for each s:\n\ns=5: 20 \u2192 no.\n\ns=6:30 \u219230 mod24=6 \u2192 no.\n\ns=7:42\u219242 mod24=18\u2192 no.\n\ns=8:56 mod24=8 \u2192 no.\n\ns=9:72 divisible by24 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=10:90 mod24=18 \u2192 no.\n\ns=11:110 mod24=110-4\u00d724=110-96=14\u2192 no.\n\ns=12:132 mod24=132-5\u00d724=132-120=12\u2192 no.\n\ns=13:156 mod24=156-6\u00d724=156-144=12\u2192 no.\n\ns=14:182 mod24 \u2192182-7\u00d724=182-168=14\u2192 no.\n\ns=15:210 mod24=210-8\u00d724=210-192=18\u2192 no.\n\ns=16:240 divisible by24 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=17:272 mod24=272-11\u00d724=272-264=8\u2192 no.\n\ns=18:306 mod24=306-12\u00d724=306-288=18\u2192 no.\n\ns=19:342 mod24=342-14\u00d724=342-336=6\u2192 no.\n\ns=20:380 mod24=380-15\u00d724=380-360=20\u2192 no.\n\ns=21:420 mod24=420-17\u00d724=420-408=12\u2192 no.\n\ns=22:462 mod24=462-19\u00d724=462-456=6\u2192 no.\n\ns=23:506 mod24=506-21\u00d724=506-504=2\u2192 no.\n\ns=24:576 divisible by24 \u21d2 yes.\n\nThus s=9,16,24.

Thus n must be between b and b\u00b2-1, and also, the digits must be valid (d1 from1 tob-1, d0 from0 tob-1).\n\nThus for each s and d1, we must ensure that d0 =s -d1 is between0 andb-1.\n\nThus for a given b, the valid s's are those where s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, and for each s, the number of valid d1's are those divisors of s(s-1) between1 and min(s, b-1).\n\nThus perhaps for b= 121:\n\ns=16:\n\nd1 can be any divisor of16\u00d715=240 less than16.\n\nDivisors of240 less than16:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15.\n\nThus10 options.\n\nThus s=16 contributes10 solutions?\n\nWait no, the count for each b is the number of s's, not the number of d1's.\n\nWait no, the number of b-beautiful numbers is the number of n's, which correspond to pairs (s, d1) such that b is fixed.\n\nFor a given b, each valid s and d1 pair gives a unique n.\n\nThus for b=121, there are7 s's, each with one or more d1's.\n\nWait no, for each s, the d1 is uniquely determined by b.\n\nWait the equation is b = [s(s-1)/d1]+1 \u21d2 for a fixed b and s, d1 must be s(s-1)/(b-1).\n\nThus for each s in the valid range, if (b-1) divides s(s-1), then there's exactly one d1 (d1 = s(s-1)/(b-1)), which must be between1 and s.\n\nThus the count for b is the number of s's in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nThus for b=121, there are7 such s's, so count is7.\n\nThus I think the problem might have a higher b.\n\nWait let's try b= 2520 (a highly composite number).\n\nb-1=2519 (prime).

Alternatively, I might have overlooked a case.\n\nWait let me try b= 121:\n\ns=16,25,40,81,96,105,120 \u21d27.\n\nWait maybe I missed s= 60:\n\ns=60 is in the range 11-120.\n\ns(s-1)=60\u00d759=3540.\n\n3540 divided by120=29.5 \u21d2 not integer.\n\nThus no.\n\ns=30:\n\n30\u00d729=870. 870/120=7.25 \u21d2 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait s= 100:\n\n100\u00d799=9900. 9900/120=82.5 \u21d2 no.\n\nThus no.\n\ns= 75:\n\n75\u00d774=5550 \u21d25550/120=46.25 \u21d2 no.\n\nHmm.\n\nThus indeed, only 7 s's for b=121.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the problem has a different approach.\n\nWait let me think of the equation s^2 = d1*b + d0,\n\nwith d0 = s -d1,\n\n\u6240\u4ee5 s^2 = d1*b +s -d1 \u21d2 s^2 -s = d1*(b-1).\n\nThus d1 = (s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1).\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between1 and b-1,\n\nwe need (s\u00b2 -s) divisible by (b-1).\n\nThus for a given s, this defines b as b= (s(s-1)/k)+1, where k is a divisor of s(s-1).\n\nThus for each s, the number of b's it can contribute is the number of divisors of s(s-1).\n\nThus the total number of b's for all s up to some n is the sum of the number of divisors of s(s-1).\n\nBut the question asks for the minimal b where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers.\n\nThus for each b, we need to count how many s's satisfy the conditions.\n\nTo have more than ten such s's for some b, the value of b must be such that many s's have their s(s-1) divisible by (b-1).\n\nThus perhaps choosing b-1 as a number with many divisors.\n\nThe smallest number with more than ten divisors is 24 (which has 8 divisors), but maybe 60 has more.\n\nWait, the number of divisors of b-1 must be such that there are many s's in the range.\n\nFor example, if b-1=24, which has 8 divisors, then for each divisor d of24, there may be s's where s(s-1) divisible by24.\n\nBut for each divisor d, there are certain congruence conditions.\n\nThus the number of solutions s for a given b-1 is equal to the number of s in the range where s \u22610 or1 mod each prime factor of b-1.\n\nThe total number of solutions is multiplicative over the prime factors.\n\nThus for example, if b-1=24=2^3\u00d73,\n\nthe number of solutions s is:\n\nFor each prime power,\n\nthe number of s \u22610 or1 mod2^3,\n\nand mod3,\n\nthen multiply the counts.\n\nThus for 2^3:\n\nPossible residues mod8: s\u22610 or1 mod8.\n\nSimilarly mod3: s\u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nThus total solutions are (number of solutions mod8) \u00d7 (number of solutions mod3).\n\nFor mod8:\n\nPossible residues0 or1 \u21d22 options.\n\nFor mod3:\n\n0 or1 \u21d22 options.\n\nThus total solutions per residue system:2\u00d72=4.\n\nThus for each s in the range that meets these conditions.\n\nThus the count is approximately (b/ (8\u00d73)) \u00d74.\n\nThus for b=25,\n\nthe count would be (24/(24)) \u00d74=4, but exact count was3.\n\nThus for larger b:\n\nTake b= 120 (b-1=119=7\u00d717).\n\nThe number of solutions would be (number of s\u22610 or1 mod7) \u00d7 (number of s\u22610 or1 mod17).\n\nEach has2 options,\n\nTotal solutions per residue system:4.\n\nThus approximately (b/ (7\u00d717)) \u00d74.\n\nThus for b=120,\n\napproximate count: (120/(119)) \u00d74\u22484 solutions, which matches the exact count of3.\n\nThus to get more than ten solutions,\n\nwe need:\n\ncount \u2248 (b/( (p1^e1 * p2^e2 ... )) ) \u00d7 (2^{number of prime factors}).\n\nTo get this over ten:\n\nAssume b-1 has two prime factors.\n\nSuppose b-1=12=2^2\u00d73.\n\nThen count\u2248 (b/12)\u00d7(2\u00d72)= (b/3).\n\nFor b=36,\n\ncount\u224812 solutions.\n\nThus at b=36,\n\npossible count might be12.\n\nLet me compute for b=36 (b-1=35=5\u00d77).\n\nThus,\n\nnumber of solutions s in [6,35] where s\u22610 or1 mod5 and mod7.\n\nThus:\n\nmod5: s\u22610 or1,\n\nmod7: s\u22610 or1,\n\nTotal solutions per residue:2\u00d72=4.\n\nThus approximate solutions: (35/35) \u00d74=4 solutions.\n\nBut exact count was3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, b-1=24 (divisors 8\u00d73):\n\ns ranges [5,24].\n\nNumber of solutions:\n\nmod8 and mod3,\n\neach has2 options,\n\nTotal solutions:4.\n\nThus (24/24)*4=4.\n\nExact count was3.\n\nHmm.\n\nThus for b-1=60 (2^2\u00d73\u00d75).\n\nThus,\n\nmod4: s\u22610 or1,\n\nmod3:0 or1,\n\nmod5:0 or1,\n\nTotal solutions per residue:2\u00d72\u00d72=8.\n\nThus approximate solutions:\n\n(b/60)*8.\n\nFor b=61,\n\n\u2248 (60/60)*8=8.\n\nThus for b=61,\n\nthe count is8.\n\nHmm.\n\nFor b= 120,\n\ncount\u2248 (120/119)*4\u22484.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A b-eautiful number is a positive integer n that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13 it's written as 63, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). \n\nFirst, I need to understand exactly what constitutes a b-eautiful number. Let me break down the problem.\n\nA two-digit number in base b would be represented as \"d1 d2\" where d1 is the first digit (the coefficient of b^1) and d2 is the second digit (the coefficient of b^0). Since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. The value of n in base 10 is then d1*b + d2. The condition for being b-eautiful is that the sum of the digits d1 + d2 must equal sqrt(n). \n\nSo, mathematically, we can write the equation:\n\nd1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2)\n\nSince d1 and d2 are digits in base b, their possible values are constrained. Specifically, d1 can be from 1 to b-1 (since it's the leading digit) and d2 can be from 0 to b-1. \n\nSo the problem reduces to finding, for each base b, the number of pairs (d1, d2) where d1 is from 1 to b-1, d2 from 0 to b-1, and such that d1 + d2 equals the square root of (d1*b + d2). We need to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nHmm. Let me formalize that.\n\nLet me denote the digits as x and y instead of d1 and d2 for simplicity. So, x \u2208 {1, 2, ..., b-1}, y \u2208 {0, 1, ..., b-1}, and the equation is x + y = sqrt(x*b + y). \n\nWe need to find the number of (x, y) pairs satisfying this equation for each b, then find the minimal b where this number is greater than 10.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. \n\n(x + y)^2 = x*b + y\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2 = x*b + y\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2 - x*b - y = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps rearranging terms:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2 - x*b - y = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to express in terms of x and y variables. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe solving for y in terms of x or vice versa.\n\nStarting from the equation:\n\n(x + y)^2 = x*b + y\n\nLet me rearrange terms to collect terms involving b. Let's see:\n\nx*b = (x + y)^2 - y\n\nHence,\n\nb = [(x + y)^2 - y] / x\n\nHmm, since b must be an integer, this expression must evaluate to an integer. So for each x and y, such that x is from 1 to b-1 and y from 0 to b-1, but here we are trying to find b in terms of x and y. Wait, but perhaps this approach is a bit tangled because b is a variable we need to find. Maybe instead we can consider this equation as a quadratic in terms of y?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables x and y with b being a parameter. For each b, we can iterate over possible x and y to see if they satisfy the equation. But since we need to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, perhaps we can find a general form for the solutions and see how the number of solutions grows with b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each possible b, the number of solutions can be calculated by considering the equation (x + y)^2 = x*b + y. Let me see if I can rearrange this equation to express y in terms of x, then find constraints on y and x given the base b.\n\nStarting with the equation:\n\n(x + y)^2 = x*b + y\n\nLet me rearrange terms to collect all terms on one side:\n\n(x + y)^2 - x*b - y = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe group terms with y:\n\nLet me expand (x + y)^2:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2xy + y\u00b2 - x*b - y = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps rearrange terms involving y:\n\ny\u00b2 + (2x - 1)y + (x\u00b2 - x*b) = 0\n\nThat's a quadratic equation in terms of y. Let me write that:\n\ny\u00b2 + (2x - 1)y + (x\u00b2 - x*b) = 0\n\nSo, for a given x (from 1 to b-1), we can consider this quadratic equation in y. The solutions for y must be integers between 0 and b-1, inclusive. So, for each x, we can solve for y and see if the solution(s) are valid digits in base b.\n\nAlternatively, maybe solving for y in terms of x and b:\n\nUsing quadratic formula for y:\n\ny = [ - (2x - 1) \u00b1 sqrt( (2x - 1)^2 - 4 * 1 * (x\u00b2 - x*b) ) ] / 2\n\nLet me compute the discriminant D:\n\nD = (2x - 1)^2 - 4*(x\u00b2 - x*b)\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst, (2x - 1)^2 = 4x\u00b2 -4x +1\n\nThen subtract 4*(x\u00b2 - x*b):\n\nSo D = 4x\u00b2 -4x +1 -4x\u00b2 +4x*b\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\n4x\u00b2 -4x +1 -4x\u00b2 +4x*b = (-4x +1) +4x*b\n\nFactor terms:\n\n= 4x*b -4x +1 = 4x(b -1) +1\n\nTherefore, the discriminant D is 4x(b - 1) + 1.\n\nFor the quadratic equation to have real solutions, the discriminant must be non-negative, which it is since x \u22651 and b \u22652, so D is positive.\n\nTherefore, the solutions for y are:\n\ny = [ - (2x -1) \u00b1 sqrt(4x(b -1) +1) ] / 2\n\nHmm, since y must be an integer between 0 and b-1, the sqrt(D) must be an integer as well, otherwise y won't be an integer. Let me denote sqrt(D) as an integer k, so:\n\nk = sqrt(4x(b -1) +1)\n\nTherefore, 4x(b -1) +1 must be a perfect square.\n\nLet me write that equation:\n\n4x(b -1) +1 = k\u00b2\n\nSo, k must be an integer such that k\u00b2 = 4x(b -1) +1\n\nMoreover, since y must be an integer, the numerator must be even. Let me check:\n\nThe expression for y is [ - (2x -1) \u00b1 k ] / 2. Since k is an integer, the numerator will be integer, but division by 2 may or may not result in an integer. Let's see.\n\nLet me also note that since y must be non-negative and less than b, the solutions must satisfy 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo, let me consider the equation k\u00b2 = 4x(b -1) +1. Let me rearrange:\n\n4x(b -1) = k\u00b2 -1 = (k -1)(k +1)\n\nTherefore, (k -1)(k +1) must be divisible by 4x. Since 4x divides (k-1)(k+1). Since (k-1) and (k+1) are two even numbers if k is odd, or both odd if k is even. Wait, but since (k -1)(k +1) is k\u00b2 -1, which is one less than a square. Since k is an integer, so if k is even, then k is even, so k-1 and k+1 are odd. Then their product is odd, so 4x must divide an odd number, which would only be possible if x is 1 and 4 divides into the product? Wait, but 4x divides (k-1)(k+1). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps k must be odd, so that (k-1) and (k+1) are even. Let me see. Let me suppose that k is odd, so that k -1 and k+1 are both even, so their product is divisible by 4, so 4 divides (k-1)(k+1). Therefore, 4 divides (k\u00b2 -1). So, if k is odd, then k\u00b2 is 1 mod 4, so k\u00b2 -1 is 0 mod4, so yes, divisible by 4. If k is even, then k\u00b2 is 0 mod4, so k\u00b2 -1 is 3 mod4, so not divisible by 4, so 4x can't divide it unless x is 0.5, which is impossible. Therefore, k must be odd. So, k must be an odd integer, so that (k-1)(k+1) is divisible by 4.\n\nTherefore, let's let k = 2m +1, where m is a non-negative integer. Then, substituting back:\n\nk = 2m +1,\n\nthen,\n\nk\u00b2 = (2m +1)^2 = 4m\u00b2 +4m +1,\n\nso,\n\n4x(b -1) +1 = 4m\u00b2 +4m +1,\n\ntherefore,\n\n4x(b -1) = 4m\u00b2 +4m,\n\ndividing both sides by 4:\n\nx(b -1) = m\u00b2 + m,\n\nso,\n\nx(b -1) = m(m +1)\n\nTherefore, m(m +1) must be divisible by x.\n\nTherefore, x divides m(m +1). Since m and m+1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, x must be a divisor of the product of two coprime numbers, so either x divides m or x divides m+1, but not necessarily both.\n\nTherefore, we can write:\n\nLet me write x divides m(m+1), so m(m+1) = x * t, where t is an integer. Then, substituting back into equation x(b -1) = m(m +1), gives:\n\nx(b -1) = x * t => b -1 = t,\n\nso, t = b -1,\n\nTherefore, m(m +1) = x*(b -1)\n\nWait, so m(m+1) = x*(b -1). So, for each x, m must satisfy m(m+1) = x*(b -1). Since m and x are integers, this equation must hold. So, for given x, m must be such that m(m+1) is divisible by x, and then b-1 = m(m+1)/x. \n\nAlternatively, for each possible x (from 1 to b-1), we can set m(m+1) = x*(b -1). Since b is the parameter we are trying to find, perhaps this approach can help us find possible (x, m, b) triples that satisfy the equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible x and m, we can set b = (m(m+1)/x) +1, and then check if the corresponding y is within the required range (0 \u2264 y \u2264 b-1). \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think of b as variable and for each b, count the number of x and y pairs that satisfy the original equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parametrize m and x such that m(m+1) is divisible by x, then b = (m(m+1)/x) +1. Then, for each such b, the corresponding x and m would give a possible solution. But I need to think if this can be structured into a count.\n\nAlternatively, let's see for each possible m, the possible x's that divide m(m+1). For each m, m(m+1) is the product of two consecutive integers, so it's always even. So, for each m, the divisors x can be any divisor of m(m+1) such that x \u2264 m(m+1)/x, since b must be at least 2. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to express y in terms of x and m, and then see what constraints are on y.\n\nWait, let's recall the equation for y:\n\nFrom the quadratic equation, we had two possible solutions for y:\n\ny = [ - (2x -1) \u00b1 k ] / 2\n\nwhere k = 2m +1 (since k was expressed as an odd integer). Let me substitute k = 2m +1 into that equation.\n\nSo:\n\ny = [ - (2x -1) \u00b1 (2m +1) ] / 2\n\nSo there are two possibilities here:\n\nFirst possibility (taking + sign):\n\ny = [ -2x +1 + 2m +1 ] / 2 = [ -2x + 2m +2 ] /2 = (-x + m +1 )\n\nSecond possibility (taking - sign):\n\ny = [ -2x +1 -2m -1 ] /2 = [ -2x -2m ] /2 = -x - m\n\nBut since y must be a non-negative integer (since it's a digit in base b), the second solution y = -x - m would be negative unless x + m \u2264 0, but since x \u22651 and m is a non-negative integer (since k =2m +1 \u22651), so the second solution will always be negative. Therefore, only the first solution is valid.\n\nTherefore, the solution is y = -x + m +1.\n\nTherefore, from the quadratic equation, the only valid solution is y = ( -x + m +1 ).\n\nBut we need y to be between 0 and b-1. Also, from the earlier equations, we had:\n\nm(m +1) = x*(b -1)\n\nand\n\nb = (m(m +1)/x ) +1\n\nTherefore, substituting b into the expression for y:\n\ny = -x + m +1\n\nBut since we also have m(m+1) = x*(b -1), so perhaps we can express m in terms of x and b, but maybe this is not straightforward. Alternatively, let's proceed step by step.\n\nGiven that y = -x + m +1, and y must be between 0 and b -1, so:\n\n0 \u2264 -x + m +1 \u2264 b -1\n\nLet me write the inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality: -x + m +1 \u2265 0 \u21d2 m +1 \u2265 x \u21d2 m \u2265 x -1\n\nSecond inequality: -x + m +1 \u2264 b -1 \u21d2 m +1 -x \u2264 b -1 \u21d2 m -x \u2264 b -2 \u21d2 m \u2264 b + x -2\n\nBut since m is related to x and b via m(m +1) = x*(b -1). Hmm, not sure if that helps yet. Let's see if we can express m in terms of x and b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps since we have expressions for y and b in terms of m and x, we can substitute back into the original equation to check consistency. Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step.\n\nWe have three equations:\n\n1. y = -x + m +1\n\n2. m(m +1) = x*(b -1)\n\n3. b = m(m+1)/x + 1\n\nWait, actually equation 3 is just a rearrangement of equation 2. From equation 2:\n\nm(m+1) = x*(b -1) \u21d2 b -1 = m(m+1)/x \u21d2 b = m(m+1)/x +1\n\nSo equation 3 is redundant once we have 1 and 2.\n\nTherefore, the key equations are equations 1 and 2.\n\nAdditionally, we must ensure that y is between 0 and b-1. Let me write down all constraints:\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. 1 \u2264 x \u2264 b -1 (since x is the first digit in base b)\n\n2. 0 \u2264 y = (-x + m +1) \u2264 b -1\n\n3. m must be a non-negative integer (since k =2m +1 is at least 1 when m \u22650)\n\nAdditionally, m(m +1) must be divisible by x (from equation 2, since m(m +1) = x*(b-1), so x divides m(m+1)).\n\nAlso, since b must be an integer, m(m+1)/x must be an integer. \n\nSo, for given m and x, such that x divides m(m+1), then b is determined as above, and y is given by equation 1. \n\nSo, for each m and x where x divides m(m+1), we can compute b and check whether the digit y is valid (i.e., 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b -1). Additionally, we need to ensure that x is a valid digit in base b, i.e., x \u2264 b -1. Since b = (m(m+1)/x) +1, then x must be \u2264 (m(m+1)/x) +1 -1 = m(m+1)/x. Wait, so x\u00b2 \u2264 m(m+1). Hmm, so that gives a constraint on x.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to count the number of solutions for a given b, we need to consider all possible m and x such that:\n\n- m is a non-negative integer,\n\n- x divides m(m +1),\n\n- b = (m(m+1)/x) +1,\n\n- y = (-x + m +1) must satisfy 0 \u2264 y \u2264 b -1,\n\n- x must be \u2264 b -1 (since x is a digit in base b),\n\n- y must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, we can iterate over possible m and x such that m(m+1)/x is an integer, and then check the constraints. But since we are to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, maybe we can find a pattern or formula for the number of solutions as a function of b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express variables in terms of m and x, then count how many (x, m) pairs satisfy the conditions for each b.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to express y in terms of m and x, then see if the constraints can be written in terms of m and x.\n\nFrom equation 1: y = -x + m +1. Since y must be non-negative, so m +1 -x \u22650 \u21d2 m \u2265 x -1. Also, since y \u2264 b -1, and b = (m(m+1)/x) +1,\n\ny \u2264 [m(m+1)/x] \n\nWait, substituting b -1 = m(m+1)/x, so y \u2264 (m(m+1)/x). \n\nBut substituting y = -x + m +1, so:\n\n- x + m +1 \u2264 m(m+1)/x\n\nMultiply both sides by x (positive since x \u22651):\n\n- x\u00b2 + (m +1)x \u2264 m(m +1)\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\n- x\u00b2 + (m +1)x - m(m +1) \u22640\n\nLet's rearrange:\n\n- x\u00b2 + (m +1)x - m(m +1) \u22640\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (inequality reverses):\n\nx\u00b2 - (m +1)x + m(m +1) \u22650\n\nHmm, perhaps factor this quadratic in x:\n\nx\u00b2 - (m +1)x + m(m +1) = x\u00b2 - (m+1)x + m(m+1)\n\nLet me see if this factors. Let me compute discriminant:\n\nD = (m+1)^2 -4*1*m(m+1) = (m+1)(m+1 -4m) = (m+1)(-3m +1)\n\nHmm, discriminant is negative unless (m+1)(-3m +1) \u22650. Since m is non-negative integer, m \u22650,\n\nIf m=0: D =1*(1) =1 >0\n\nm=1: D=2*(-2) =-4 <0\n\nm=2: D=3*(-5)= -15 <0\n\nSo except for m=0, the quadratic doesn't factor nicely. Hmm, perhaps this approach isn't helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe trying specific values of m and x to see how solutions can be found.\n\nAlternatively, since for given m and x, b is determined as b = (m(m+1)/x) +1. So for each pair (m, x) where x divides m(m+1) and x \u2264 m(m+1)/x (since x\u00b2 \u2264 m(m+1)), then we can compute b and see if the corresponding y is between 0 and b-1.\n\nMoreover, since x must be at most b-1, which is (m(m+1)/x) +1 -1 = m(m+1)/x. Therefore, x must be \u2264 m(m+1)/x \u21d2 x\u00b2 \u2264 m(m+1). So, x can be any divisor of m(m+1) that is at most sqrt(m(m+1)). Hmm, since x divides m(m+1), and x <= sqrt(m(m+1)). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions for a given b is equal to the number of divisors x of m(m+1) (for some m) such that x <= sqrt(m(m+1)) and b = (m(m+1)/x) +1. Wait, this is getting convoluted. Maybe it's better to consider each m and then count the number of x's for that m which satisfy the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of m as a variable and for each m, the number of possible x's (divisors of m(m+1)) such that x divides m(m+1), and x <= sqrt(m(m+1)), then each such x gives a unique b, and for each such pair (m, x) we get a solution (x, y). But since we need to count the number of solutions for each b, perhaps this approach can help.\n\nAlternatively, let me try small values of b and see how many solutions they have, then find when the count exceeds 10.\n\nStarting with b=2:\n\nFor b=2, possible digits x (first digit) is 1, and y can be 0 or 1 (since base 2 digits are 0 and 1). So two-digit numbers in base 2 are 10 and 11, which are 2 and 3 in decimal. \n\nCheck the condition:\n\nFor 2 (10 in base 2):\n\nDigits sum:1+0=1. sqrt(2) \u22481.414\u22601. Not valid.\n\nFor 3 (11 in base 2):\n\nDigits sum:1+1=2. sqrt(3)\u22481.732\u22602. Not valid. So b=2 has 0 solutions.\n\nb=3:\n\nDigits: x=1,2; y=0,1,2.\n\nPossible two-digit numbers:\n\n10 (3), 11 (4), 12 (5),\n\n20 (6), 21 (7), 22 (8).\n\nCheck each:\n\n3: digits 1,0. sum=1. sqrt(3)\u22481.732\u22601\n\n4: digits 1,1. sum=2. sqrt(4)=2. So this works.\n\n5: digits1,2. sum=3. sqrt(5)\u22482.236\u22603\n\n6: digits2,0. sum=2. sqrt(6)\u22482.449\u22602\n\n7: digits2,1. sum=3. sqrt(7)\u22482.645\u22603\n\n8: digits2,2. sum=4. sqrt(8)\u22482.828\u22604\n\nSo only 4 is valid. So b=3 has 1 solution.\n\nb=4:\n\nDigits x=1,2,3; y=0,1,2,3.\n\nTwo-digit numbers:\n\n10 (4), 11 (5), 12 (6), 13 (7),\n\n20 (8), 21 (9), 22 (10), 23 (11),\n\n30 (12), 31 (13), 32 (14), 33 (15).\n\nCheck each:\n\n4:1+0=1 vs sqrt(4)=2 \u2192 no\n\n5:1+1=2 vs sqrt(5)\u22482.236 \u2192 no\n\n6:1+2=3 vs sqrt(6)\u22482.449 \u2192 no\n\n7:1+3=4 vs sqrt(7)\u22482.645 \u2192 no\n\n8:2+0=2 vs sqrt(8)\u22482.828 \u2192 no\n\n9:2+1=3 vs sqrt(9)=3 \u2192 yes!\n\n10:2+2=4 vs sqrt(10)\u22483.162 \u2192 no\n\n11:2+3=5 vs sqrt(11)\u22483.316 \u2192 no\n\n12:3+0=3 vs sqrt(12)\u22483.464 \u2192 no\n\n13:3+1=4 vs sqrt(13)\u22483.605 \u2192 no\n\n14:3+2=5 vs sqrt(14)\u22483.741 \u2192 no\n\n15:3+3=6 vs sqrt(15)\u22483.872 \u2192 no\n\nSo only 9 (21 in base4) is valid.

So b=6 has 1 solution.\n\nHmm, still only 1. Let's try b=7.\n\nb=7:\n\nDigits x=1-6, y=0-6.\n\nTwo-digit numbers from 7 (10) to 48 (66 in base7).\n\nThis might take longer, but let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Wait, so far, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is 1, except perhaps I missed some?\n\nWait, let me check for b=9.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look for when the equation (x + y)^2 = x*b + y has multiple solutions. Maybe when b is higher, the number of solutions increases.\n\nAlternatively, let me think back to the equation:\n\nWe had that y = -x + m +1,\n\nand m(m+1) = x*(b -1),\n\nand b must be (m(m+1)/x) +1.\n\nAlso, from y = -x + m +1, since y is non-negative, m +1 -x \u22650 \u21d2 m \u2265x -1.\n\nAlso, y must be less than b, so:\n\n- x + m +1 < b,\n\nBut b = (m(m+1)/x) +1,\n\nso substituting:\n\n- x + m +1 < (m(m+1)/x) +1,\n\nSubtract 1:\n\n- x + m < m(m+1)/x,\n\nMultiply both sides by x (positive):\n\n- x\u00b2 + m x < m(m +1),\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n- x\u00b2 + m x - m(m +1) <0,\n\nMultiply by -1 (reverse inequality):\n\nx\u00b2 - m x + m(m +1) >0,\n\nHmm, this is the same quadratic as before, which is x\u00b2 - m x + m(m+1) >0. Not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe proceed with higher b.\n\nLet me try b=13, since the example given is b=13 with n=81 (63 in base13). Let's see how many solutions b=13 has.\n\nFirst, for b=13, the two-digit numbers go from 13 (10) up to 13*12 +12= 168 (12*13 +12).\n\nWe need to find all numbers n where n = x*13 + y, digits x from 1-12, y from0-12, and x + y = sqrt(n).\n\nLet me note that sqrt(n) must be an integer since x + y is an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. So n = k\u00b2, where k =x + y.\n\nTherefore, for each two-digit number in base13, which is n =13x + y, we need that 13x + y = k\u00b2, and k =x + y. So substituting k =x + y into the equation:\n\n13x + y = (x + y)^2\n\nThis is exactly the equation we had before. So, for b=13, the example given is 81=9\u00b2= (6+3)^2=9\u00b2. Let's see how many such numbers exist.\n\nTo compute the number of solutions for b=13, let me use the equation:\n\n(x + y)^2 =13x + y,\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\nx\u00b2 +2xy + y\u00b2 -13x - y =0,\n\nAlternatively, let me use the earlier approach where m(m +1)=x*(b-1)=x*12,\n\nand y = -x + m +1.\n\nSo for each possible m, such that m(m+1) is divisible by x, and then b is 13, so m(m+1)/x =12,\n\nThus m(m+1)=12x,\n\nand y = -x + m +1.\n\nAlso x must be between1 and12,\n\nand y must be between0 and12.\n\nSo for m(m+1)=12x,\n\npossible m?\n\nWe can think m(m+1) must be a multiple of12, since 12x,\n\nso m(m+1) must be divisible by12. Since m and m+1 are consecutive integers, one of them is even, and one is divisible by3 or 4? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me find all m where m(m+1) divides 12x, but perhaps better to proceed step by step.\n\nPossible m such that m(m+1) is divisible by12, since 12x must be divisible by x, but m(m+1)=12x. So for each m, x = m(m+1)/12, but x must be integer between1 and12.\n\nTherefore, m(m+1) must be divisible by12, and m(m+1)/12 must be an integer between1 and12.\n\nLet me find m such that m(m+1) is divisible by12, and m(m+1)/12 \u226412 \u21d2 m(m+1) \u2264144.\n\nSo possible m where m(m+1) \u2264144 and divisible by12.\n\nLet me list m starting from 0 upwards until m(m+1) exceeds144:\n\nm=0: 0*1=0 \u2192 divisible by12? 0 is divisible, but then x=0, which is invalid since x must be \u22651.\n\nm=1:1*2=2 \u2192 no\n\nm=2:2*3=6 \u2192 no\n\nm=3:3*4=12 \u2192 yes. Then x=12/12=1. So x=1, m=3. Then y= -1 +3 +1=3. So y=3. Then check if y is within 0-12: yes. So n=13*1 +3=16. Check if 1+3=4, sqrt(16)=4. Correct. So that's valid.\n\nm=4:4*5=20 \u2192 20 divisible by12? 20/12 \u22481.666\u2192 no.\n\nm=5:5*6=30. 30 divisible by12? 30/12=2.5\u2192 no.\n\nm=6:6*7=42. 42/12=3.5\u2192 no.\n\nm=7:7*8=56. 56/12\u22484.666\u2192 no.\n\nm=8:8*9=72. 72 divisible by12 \u2192 yes. x=72/12=6. So x=6, m=8. Then y= -6 +8 +1=3. y=3. n=13*6 +3=78 +3=81. Which is the example given. 6+3=9, sqrt(81)=9. Correct.\n\nm=9:9*10=90. 90/12=7.5\u2192 no.\n\nm=10:10*11=110. 110/12 \u22489.166\u2192 no.\n\nm=11:11*12=132. 132 divisible by12 \u2192132/12=11. So x=11. Then y= -11 +11 +1=1. So y=1. Check n=13*11 +1=143 +1=144. 11+1=12, sqrt(144)=12. Correct.\n\nm=12:12*13=156. 156/12=13. But x must be \u226412 (since b=13). So x=13 is invalid. Thus m=12 is too big.\n\nSo m=3,8,11 give valid x=1,6,11.\n\nWait, let me check m=0 again. m=0 gives m(m+1)=0, so x=0, which is invalid. So only m=3,8,11. Therefore, three solutions for b=13? But the example had 81 as one, which is there, but there are two more?\n\nWait, let me check the first solution m=3, x=1, y=3:\n\nn=13*1 +3=16. 1+3=4, sqrt(16)=4. That works.\n\nSecond m=8, x=6, y=3 gives 81.\n\nThird m=11, x=11, y=1:\n\nn=13*11 +1=143+1=144. 11+1=12, sqrt(144)=12. Correct.\n\nWait, so that's three solutions for b=13. But the problem statement says \"more than ten\" so maybe higher b's have more solutions. Maybe my approach is missing something here.\n\nWait, perhaps m can be higher? Let's see. Wait, m(m+1) must be 12x, so m(m+1) must be a multiple of12, but also x must be at most12. So m(m+1) can be up to12*12=144, so m=11 gives m(m+1)=132, which is okay. m=12 would give 156>144. So indeed only three solutions for b=13.\n\nHmm, so maybe my previous approach is correct. Let's check b=10.\n\nWait, let me try b=10 to see how many solutions.\n\nb=10:\n\nDigits x=1-9, y=0-9.\n\nEquation: (x+y)^2 =10x + y.\n\nLet me try the same approach.\n\nm(m+1)=x*(b-1)=x*9,\n\nso m(m+1)=9x,\n\nand y = -x +m +1.\n\nAlso x from1-9, y from0-9.\n\nThus m must satisfy m(m+1)=9x,\n\nso possible m(m+1) must be divisible by9,\n\nand m(m+1)/9 must be between1-9 (since x is from1-9).\n\nSo m(m+1)/9 must be integer between1 and9 \u21d2 m(m+1) divisible by9, and m(m+1) between9 and81.\n\nLet me find m such that m(m+1) divisible by9, and m(m+1) between9 and81.\n\nPossible m:\n\nm=2: 2*3=6 \u2192 no.\n\nm=3:3*4=12 \u2192 12/9\u22481.333\u2192 no.\n\nm=4:4*5=20\u2192 no.\n\nm=5:5*6=30\u219230/9\u22483.33\u2192 no.\n\nm=6:6*7=42\u219242/9\u22484.666\u2192 no.\n\nm=7:7*8=56\u219256/9\u22486.222\u2192 no.\n\nm=8:8*9=72\u219272/9=8. So x=8.\n\nSo m=8: x=8, y= -8 +8 +1=1. So y=1. Then n=10*8 +1=81. 8+1=9, sqrt(81)=9. Correct.\n\nm=9:9*10=90\u219290/9=10, but x must be \u22649. So x=10 is invalid.\n\nm=0:0\u2192 no.\n\nm=1:1*2=2\u2192 no.\n\nm=2: no.\n\nm=3: no.\n\nm=4: no.\n\nWait, m=8 gives x=8, y=1. Any others?\n\nm= let's see m= 5:5*6=30, which would need x=30/9=3.333\u2192 not integer.\n\nm= 6:42/9=4.666\u2192 no.\n\nm= 7:56/9\u22486.22\u2192 no.\n\nm= 0:0\u2192 no.\n\nm= 12: but m(m+1)=12*13=156>81.\n\nSo only m=8 gives a valid solution. So b=10 has 1 solution (n=81). Wait but that's the same as b=13's n=81. Wait, 81 in base10 is written as 81, which is two digits only if b>8. Because in base10, it's three digits. Wait, in base10, two-digit numbers go up to 99. 81 is a two-digit number in base10, so in base10, 81 is '8' and '1', so digits 8 and1, which sum to9, sqrt(81)=9. So yes, that works. So b=10 also has one solution (81). Hmm.\n\nWait, so perhaps my approach is correct. Let me check for b=8.\n\nb=8:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from8 (10) to 63 (77 base8).\n\nEquation: (x+y)^2 =8x + y.\n\nUsing the previous method:\n\nm(m+1)=x*(b-1)=x*7,\n\nso m(m+1)=7x,\n\nso m(m+1) must be divisible by7,\n\nand m(m+1)/7 must be between1 and7 (since x \u22647).\n\nSo m(m+1) between7 and49.\n\nPossible m:\n\nm=2:2*3=6\u2192 no.\n\nm=3:3*4=12\u219212/7\u22481.714\u2192 no.\n\nm=4:4*5=20\u219220/7\u22482.857\u2192 no.\n\nm=5:5*6=30\u219230/7\u22484.285\u2192 no.\n\nm=6:6*7=42\u219242/7=6. So x=6.\n\nThus m=6, x=6. Then y= -6 +6 +1=1.\n\nThus n=8*6 +1=49. 6+1=7, sqrt(49)=7. Correct.\n\nm=7:7*8=56\u219256/7=8, but x=8 is invalid since b=8. So x must be \u22647.\n\nThus only m=6 gives x=6, y=1. So one solution for b=8.\n\nHmm, so going back, it seems that for each b, there are very few solutions, maybe 1 or 2. The example given for b=13 had three solutions. Let me see when the count becomes higher.\n\nWait, maybe trying b= 12:\n\nb=12:\n\nEquation: (x+y)^2 =12x + y,\n\nm(m+1)=x*11,\n\nso m(m+1)=11x,\n\nso m(m+1) divisible by11,\n\nand m(m+1)/11 must be between1 and11 (since x \u226411).\n\nSo m(m+1) between11 and 121,\n\nand divisible by11.\n\nPossible m:\n\nm=10:10*11=110 \u2192110/11=10. So x=10.\n\nThus m=10, x=10, y= -10 +10 +1=1. Check:\n\nn=12*10 +1=121. 10+1=11, sqrt(121)=11. Correct.\n\nm=11:11*12=132 \u2192132/11=12. But x must be \u226411. So invalid.\n\nm=?\n\nm= 3:3*4=12\u2192 no.\n\nm= 5:5*6=30\u219230/11\u22482.72\u2192 no.\n\nm= 1:1*2=2\u2192 no.\n\nm= 2:2*3=6\u2192 no.\n\nm= 4:4*5=20\u219220/11\u22481.8\u2192 no.\n\nm= 7:7*8=56\u219256/11\u22485.09\u2192 no.\n\nm= 8:8*9=72\u219272/11\u22486.54\u2192 no.\n\nm=9:9*10=90\u219290/11\u22488.18\u2192 no.\n\nOnly m=10 gives x=10, y=1. So one solution for b=12.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let me try b= 16.\n\nb=16.\n\nThen m(m+1)=x*15,\n\nso m(m+1) must be divisible by15,\n\nand m(m+1)/15 must be between1 and15 (since x \u226415).\n\nSo m(m+1) between15 and225.\n\nLooking for m such that m(m+1) divisible by15,\n\nPossible m:\n\nm=4:4*5=20\u219220/15\u22481.333\u2192 no.\n\nm=5:5*6=30 \u219230/15=2. So x=2.\n\nThus m=5, x=2, y= -2 +5 +1=4.\n\nn=16*2 +4=36. sqrt(36)=6. 2+4=6. Correct.\n\nm=9:9*10=90\u219290/15=6\u2192x=6.\n\nThen y= -6 +9 +1=4. n=16*6 +4=96 +4=100. sqrt(100)=10. 6+4=10. Correct.\n\nm=14:14*15=210\u2192210/15=14. x=14. y= -14 +14 +1=1. n=16*14 +1=224+1=225. sqrt(225)=15. 14+1=15. Correct.\n\nm=0:0\u2192 no.\n\nm= 15:15*16=240>225.\n\nm= 10:10*11=110\u2192110/15\u22487.333\u2192 no.\n\nm= 3:3*4=12\u2192 no.\n\nm= 12:12*13=156\u2192156/15=10.4\u2192 no.\n\nm= 7:7*8=56\u219256/15\u22483.73\u2192 no.\n\nm= 8:8*9=72\u219272/15=4.8\u2192 no.\n\nm= 13:13*14=182\u2192182/15\u224812.13\u2192 no.\n\nSo m=5,9,14 give x=2,6,14 respectively. So three solutions for b=16: 36,100,225.\n\nThus b=16 has three solutions.\n\nHmm, so the count is increasing. Let me see for b=20.\n\nb=20:\n\nm(m+1)=x*19,\n\nso m(m+1) divisible by19,\n\nand m(m+1)/19 must be between1 and19.\n\nThus m(m+1) between19 and361.\n\nPossible m where m(m+1) divisible by19.\n\n19 is prime, so m or m+1 must be divisible by19.\n\nThus m=18:18*19=342\u2192342/19=18. So x=18,\n\nthen y= -18 +18 +1=1. n=20*18 +1=361. sqrt(361)=19. 18+1=19. Correct.\n\nm=19-1=18, which is above.\n\nWait, m=18 gives x=18, which is allowed since b=20, so x can be up to19, but x=18 is okay.\n\nAlso m=0:0\u2192 no.\n\nm=19:19*20=380>361.\n\nWait, m= 17:17*18=306\u2192306/19\u224816.1\u2192 no.\n\nm= let's see m= 18 is the only one where m(m+1) divisible by19.\n\nAlternatively, m+1 divisible by19:\n\nm+1=19 \u21d2 m=18,\n\nor m+1=38 \u21d2 m=37, but m(m+1)=37*38=1406 which is more than 361.\n\nThus only m=18 gives a valid solution. So one solution for b=20.\n\nHmm, so maybe primes are not good. Let me try b= 24.\n\nb=24.\n\nEquation: (x + y)^2 =24x + y,\n\nso m(m+1)=x*23,\n\nso m(m+1)=23x,\n\nso m(m+1) divisible by23, which is prime.\n\nSo m or m+1 divisible by23.\n\nThus m=22:22*23=506\u2192506/23=22. So x=22. Then y= -22+22+1=1. n=24*22 +1=528+1=529. sqrt(529)=23. 22+1=23. Correct.\n\nm=23:23*24=552\u2192552/23=24. But x must be \u226423. So invalid.\n\nThus only one solution for b=24.\n\nHmm, not helpful. Let me try b= 9.\n\nWait, let me try b=15.\n\nb=15:\n\nm(m+1)=x*14,\n\nso m(m+1) divisible by14,\n\nand m(m+1)/14 between1 and14.\n\nPossible m:\n\nm=3:3*4=12\u2192 no.\n\nm=6:6*7=42\u219242/14=3. x=3.\n\nThen y= -3 +6 +1=4. n=15*3 +4=49. sqrt(49)=7. 3+4=7. Correct.\n\nm=7:7*8=56\u219256/14=4. x=4.\n\ny= -4 +7 +1=4. n=15*4 +4=64. sqrt(64)=8. 4+4=8. Correct.\n\nm=13:13*14=182\u2192182/14=13. x=13. y= -13 +13 +1=1. n=15*13 +1=195+1=196. sqrt(196)=14. 13+1=14. Correct.\n\nm= 0\u2192 no.\n\nm= 2:2*3=6\u2192 no.\n\nm=4:4*5=20\u219220/14\u22481.428\u2192 no.\n\nm=5:5*6=30\u219230/14\u22482.14\u2192 no.\n\nm=8:8*9=72\u219272/14\u22485.14\u2192 no.\n\nm=9:9*10=90\u219290/14\u22486.42\u2192 no.\n\nm=10:10*11=110\u2192110/14\u22487.85\u2192 no.\n\nm=11:11*12=132\u2192132/14\u22489.42\u2192 no.\n\nm=12:12*13=156\u2192156/14\u224811.14\u2192 no.\n\nSo m=6,7,13 gives x=3,4,13 \u2192 three solutions for b=15.\n\nHmm, so b=15 has three solutions. Let me see b= 18.\n\nb=18:\n\nm(m+1)=x*17,\n\nso m(m+1)=17x,\n\n17 is prime, so m or m+1 divisible by17.\n\nSo m=16:16*17=272\u2192272/17=16. x=16. y= -16+16+1=1. n=18*16+1=289. sqrt(289)=17. 16+1=17. Correct.\n\nm=17:17*18=306\u2192306/17=18. x=18 is invalid (since x must be \u226417).\n\nThus only one solution for b=18.\n\nHmm. Maybe b= 21.\n\nWait, perhaps trying b= 25.\n\nb=25:\n\nm(m+1)=x*24,\n\nso m(m+1) divisible by24.\n\nPossible m:\n\nLooking for m(m+1)/24 between1 and24.\n\nm=4:4*5=20\u2192 no.\n\nm=7:7*8=56\u219256/24\u22482.33\u2192 no.\n\nm=8:8*9=72\u219272/24=3. So x=3.\n\ny= -3+8+1=6. n=25*3 +6=81. sqrt(81)=9. 3+6=9. Correct.\n\nm=15:15*16=240\u2192240/24=10. x=10.\n\ny= -10 +15 +1=6. n=25*10 +6=256. sqrt(256)=16. 10+6=16. Correct.\n\nm=23:23*24=552\u2192552/24=23. x=23. y= -23 +23 +1=1. n=25*23+1=575+1=576. sqrt(576)=24. 23+1=24. Correct.\n\nm= 3: 3*4=12\u2192 no.\n\nm= 5:5*6=30\u219230/24=1.25\u2192 no.\n\nm= 6:6*7=42\u219242/24\u22481.75\u2192 no.\n\nm= 9:9*10=90\u219290/24\u22483.75\u2192 no.\n\nm= 10:10*11=110\u2192110/24\u22484.58\u2192 no.\n\nm= 12:12*13=156\u2192156/24=6.5\u2192 no.\n\nm= 14:14*15=210\u2192210/24\u22488.75\u2192 no.\n\nm= 16:16*17=272\u2192272/24\u224811.33\u2192 no.\n\nm= 17:17*18=306\u2192306/24\u224812.75\u2192 no.\n\nm= 20:20*21=420\u2192420/24=17.5\u2192 no.\n\nm= 22:22*23=506\u2192506/24\u224821.08\u2192 no.\n\nThus m=8,15,23 give three solutions for b=25.\n\nHmm, so it seems like when b-1 is composite, the number of solutions increases. Let me try b= 12:\n\nWait, b= 12 had one solution. Hmm, perhaps when b-1 is a multiple of a number that allows more divisors.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of when b-1 is a triangular number? Wait, m(m+1) is a triangular number. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the equation m(m+1)=x*(b-1). For a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors x of m(m+1) where x divides m(m+1) and x <= sqrt(m(m+1)), since x must be at most sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nWait, since m(m+1)=x*(b-1), so (b-1)=m(m+1)/x. Since b must be an integer, so x must divide m(m+1). Also, since x is a digit in base b, x \u2264 b-1. But since b-1 = m(m+1)/x, then x \u2264 m(m+1)/x \u21d2 x\u00b2 \u2264 m(m+1). So x can be any divisor of m(m+1) that is at most sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions for a given b is the number of pairs (m, x) where m is a non-negative integer, x divides m(m+1), x \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)), and (m(m+1)/x)+1 = b.\n\nTherefore, for a given b, the number of solutions is the number of divisors x of m(m+1) for some m such that m(m+1)/x = b -1, and x \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)). \n\nAlternatively, to count the number of solutions for a given b, we can iterate over possible m such that m(m+1) is divisible by (b-1), then x = m(m+1)/(b-1) must be an integer, and x must also satisfy x \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)), and x must be between1 and b-1.\n\nWait, so for each divisor x of m(m+1), such that m(m+1)/x =b-1,\n\nthen x must be a divisor of m(m+1) and m(m+1) must be divisible by (b-1).\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each b, the number of solutions is the number of divisors x of (b-1)*x such that x\u00b2 \u2264 m(m+1)=x*(b-1).\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe the key is that for each m, the number of valid x's is the number of divisors x of m(m+1) such that x \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)) and (b = m(m+1)/x +1).\n\nThus, for each m, the possible x's are the divisors of m(m+1) that are \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)), and each such x gives a b=m(m+1)/x +1. Therefore, for each m, there are as many solutions as the number of such x's, and each solution corresponds to a different b. \n\nAlternatively, for a given b, the number of solutions is the number of pairs (m, x) such that m(m+1) =x*(b-1), x divides m(m+1), and x \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)). So, the number of such pairs (m, x) is equal to the number of divisors x of (b-1)*k, but this is perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions for b is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to sqrt(b-1). Wait, not exactly, but maybe related.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that for each m, m(m+1) can produce a b when x divides m(m+1). So, for each m, the number of possible x's is equal to the number of divisors of m(m+1) that are \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)). Each such x gives a b value. Therefore, the total number of solutions for a given b is equal to the number of m's and x's such that m(m+1)/x =b-1 and x divides m(m+1). Thus, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as m(m+1)/x where x divides m(m+1).\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions for b is the number of divisors x of m(m+1) such that m(m+1)/x = b-1. Thus, for each divisor x of (b-1)*x, but this seems circular.\n\nPerhaps the key insight is that for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two integers a and b such that a*b = (b-1), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions for b is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1). Wait, but for example, for b=13, b-1=12, which has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12. Then, the number of solutions was 3. Hmm, but 12 has 6 divisors. So that doesn't align.\n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to sqrt(b-1). For b=13, b-1=12. sqrt(12)\u22483.464. Divisors of 12 less than or equal to 3.46 are 1,2,3. So three divisors, which matches the three solutions. For b=16, b-1=15. sqrt(15)\u22483.87. Divisors of15 less than 3.87:1,3. But earlier, b=16 had three solutions. Hmm, so that doesn't align.\n\nWait, for b=16, b-1=15. The solutions came from m=5,9,14:\n\nm=5: m(m+1)=30. So 30/x=15 \u21d2 x=2.\n\nm=9: m(m+1)=90 \u21d290/x=15 \u21d2x=6.\n\nm=14: m(m+1)=210 \u21d2210/x=15 \u21d2x=14.\n\nSo in this case, the divisors x are 2,6,14. These are divisors of 15* x? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the x's are divisors of m(m+1) for some m such that m(m+1)/x =15. Thus, for each m such that 15 divides m(m+1), then x = m(m+1)/15 must be an integer, and x must satisfy x <= sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nFor m=5: m(m+1)=30. 30/15=2. x=2, which is sqrt(30)\u22485.477. So 2 <=5.477. So valid.\n\nm=9: m(m+1)=90. 90/15=6. sqrt(90)=9.486. 6<=9.486. Valid.\n\nm=14: m(m+1)=210. 210/15=14. sqrt(210)=14.49. 14 <=14.49. Valid.\n\nTherefore, the three solutions correspond to m=5,9,14. So the number of solutions for b=16 is the number of m's such that m(m+1) is divisible by (b-1)=15, and x=m(m+1)/15 satisfies x<=sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nThus, the number of solutions for b is equal to the number of m's where m(m+1) is divisible by (b-1), and x=m(m+1)/(b-1) is at most sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nSo, to find the number of solutions for a given b, we can consider all m such that:\n\n1. m(m+1) is divisible by (b-1).\n\n2. x = m(m+1)/(b-1) is an integer.\n\n3. x <= sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nAdditionally, x must be between 1 and b-1, but since x = m(m+1)/(b-1) and b = m(m+1)/x +1, so substituting gives b = (m(m+1)/x)+1 \u21d2 x = m(m+1)/(b-1), so x must be in the valid range.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers m \u22650 such that m(m+1) is divisible by (b-1), and x = m(m+1)/(b-1) satisfies x \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nTo find the least b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps we can find for each b starting from 2 upwards, compute the number of valid m's, and stop when it exceeds 10.\n\nThis might be tedious manually, but perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, note that for each divisor d of b-1, there might correspond an m. Wait, perhaps considering m and m+1 such that their product is a multiple of b-1, and so on.\n\nAlternatively, notice that the number of solutions for b is equal to the number of divisors of b-1 times some factor? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for b-1 being a highly composite number, which has many divisors, the number of solutions increases.\n\nLet me try with b= 252. Wait, maybe too big. Let's try b= 25.\n\nWait, but let's try a better approach.\n\nLet me think of the equation m(m+1)=x*(b-1). For each m, x must be a divisor of m(m+1), and then b is determined. Thus, for each m, the number of x's that divide m(m+1) and satisfy x \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)) gives the number of b's for which this m contributes a solution.\n\nAlternatively, to find the total number of solutions for a given b, it's the number of m's such that m(m+1) is divisible by (b-1), and x= m(m+1)/(b-1) \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)), so m(m+1)/(b-1) \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)), which implies that m(m+1) \u2264 (b-1)^2.\n\nThus:\n\nm(m+1) \u2264 (b-1)^2,\n\nand m(m+1) must be divisible by (b-1).\n\nSo for each m up to sqrt((b-1)^2) which is b-1, but m can be up to ?\n\nAlternatively, this is getting too complex. Maybe a better way is to code this or find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, notice that for each m, the equation m(m+1) =x*(b-1) can be rearranged to b= m(m+1)/x +1. For each m, the possible x's are the divisors of m(m+1) that are \u2264sqrt(m(m+1)). Each such x gives a different b. So the total number of solutions for a given b is the number of (m,x) pairs where m(m+1)/x = b-1 and x divides m(m+1) and x \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write b-1 as (m(m+1))/x where x divides m(m+1) and x \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nTherefore, to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, we need to find the smallest b such that there are at least 11 such representations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, the number of x's contributing to b is the number of divisors x of m(m+1) such that x \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)). Each such x gives a b value. Therefore, the total number of solutions across all b is the sum over m of the number of such x's for each m. \n\nBut we need the first b where the count for that particular b exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions for a given b is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1) that are less than or equal to sqrt(b-1). Wait, but when we saw for b=13, which had b-1=12, which has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12. The divisors less than sqrt(12)\u22483.46 are 1,2,3, which is 3 solutions. Which matches. For b=16, b-1=15, sqrt(15)=3.87, divisors less than that are 1,3. But earlier it had three solutions, so that contradicts. Wait, but in that case, the solutions came from different m's. \n\nWait for b=16, the divisors of 15 are 1,3,5,15. The divisors less than sqrt(15)=3.87 are 1,3. But there were three solutions (x=2,6,14). Hmm, so perhaps my previous idea is incorrect.\n\nWait, maybe the number of solutions for b is the number of divisors of (b-1) multiplied by something else. Alternatively, the number of solutions is the number of factorizations of (b-1) as a product of two numbers a and x, such that a*x = b-1 and a = m, x = m+1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to write (b-1) as a product of two integers a and b such that a and b are consecutive numbers? Wait, m and m+1 are consecutive, so m(m+1) = (b-1)*x. So (b-1)*x = m(m+1). So for each m, x = m(m+1)/(b-1). Thus, for a given b-1, the number of m's such that b-1 divides m(m+1), and x is an integer, and x \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for b-1 being a factorial or triangular number? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think that for each m, the number of solutions contributed to b is 1 if x is valid. So to find when the count exceeds 10, perhaps choosing b-1 to have many divisors, so that many m's can be factored into multiples.\n\nAlternatively, let's try b= 242. Wait, maybe b= 121?\n\nWait, let me try b= 253. Wait, maybe this is getting too big. Alternatively, let me try b= 121.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that for b-1 being a highly composite number, which has many factors, so that m(m+1) can be divided by b-1 in many ways.\n\nFor example, take b-1= 24, which is highly composite.\n\nThen b=25.\n\nWait, earlier for b=25 had three solutions. Hmm, but 24 has many divisors.\n\nWait, let me try b= 25:\n\nb=25, b-1=24.\n\nPossible m such that m(m+1) divisible by24.\n\nPossible m's:\n\nm=3:3*4=12\u219212/24=0.5\u2192 no.\n\nm=4:4*5=20\u219220/24\u22480.83\u2192 no.\n\nm=7:7*8=56\u219256/24\u22482.33\u2192 no.\n\nm=8:8*9=72\u219272/24=3. x=3.\n\nThus x=3, m=8, gives b=24/3 +1=25.\n\nWait, no, sorry.

Then y= -4+15+1=12. Check n=61*4? No, wait b=61, so n= m(m+1)/x *x + y? Wait, no, n= x*b + y.\n\nWait, n= x*b + y = x*(m(m+1)/x +1) + y. But y= -x +m +1. Thus:\n\nn= x*( (m(m+1)/x) +1 ) + (-x +m +1 )\n\n= m(m+1) +x -x +m +1\n\n= m(m+1) + m +1\n\n= m^2 +m +m +1 = m^2 +2m +1 = (m+1)^2. Which makes sense because sqrt(n)=m+1. Wait, this is consistent with the original equation.\n\nAnyway, for m=15, x=4: y= -4+15+1=12. So digits x=4 (must be \u226460) and y=12 (\u226460). Then n=(m+1)^2=16\u00b2=256. 4+12=16, sqrt(256)=16.

Still not enough.\n\nHmm, this approach is taking too long manually. Maybe I need to find a better way.\n\nWait, the number of solutions for b is equal to the number of divisors of b-1 that are less than or equal to sqrt(b-1). Wait, in previous examples:\n\nFor b=13 (b-1=12):\n\nDivisors of12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. Divisors \u2264 sqrt(12)\u22483.464 are 1,2,3. Which matches the 3 solutions.\n\nFor b=16 (b-1=15):\n\nDivisors of15 are1,3,5,15. Divisors \u2264 sqrt(15)\u22483.872 are1,3. But there were three solutions. Hmm, discrepancy.\n\nWait, but in b=16, solutions came from m=5 (x=2), m=9 (x=6), m=14 (x=14).\n\nThe x's are2,6,14. These are not divisors of15 (b-1=15). So my previous idea is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m(m+1) for various m such that m(m+1) is divisible by b-1 and x=m(m+1)/(b-1) \u2264 sqrt(m(m+1)).\n\nThis seems too variable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 121 but we need to compute more.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 253? But we saw that b=253 had only 7 solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the equation (x + y)^2 =x*b + y.\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\n(x + y)^2 - y = x*b,\n\n=> (x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - y) = x*b,\n\n=> x^2 + 2xy + y^2 - y -x*b =0.\n\nBut this might not help.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of possible squares:\n\nLet k =x + y. Then n =k\u00b2 =x*b + y.\n\nSo substituting y =k -x,\n\nwe have k\u00b2 =x*b + (k -x),\n\n=> k\u00b2 =x*(b -1) +k,\n\n=> x*(b-1) =k\u00b2 -k,\n\n=> x = (k\u00b2 -k)/(b -1).\n\nSince x must be a positive integer \u2264 b-1,\n\nso (k\u00b2 -k) must be divisible by (b-1),\n\nand (k\u00b2 -k)/(b-1) \u2264 b-1,\n\n=> k\u00b2 -k \u2264 (b-1)^2,\n\n=> k(k-1) \u2264 (b-1)^2.\n\nAdditionally, since y =k -x must be between0 and b-1,\n\n0 \u2264 y =k -x =k - (k\u00b2 -k)/(b-1) \u2264b-1.\n\nThis gives constraints on k.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the possible values of k are integers such that:\n\n1. k\u00b2 -k is divisible by (b-1),\n\n2. x=(k\u00b2 -k)/(b-1) is an integer between1 and b-1,\n\n3. y=k -x is between0 and b-1.\n\nSo for each b, the number of solutions is the number of integers k such that:\n\n- k(k-1) is divisible by (b-1),\n\n- 1 \u2264 x=(k\u00b2 -k)/(b-1) \u2264b-1,\n\n- 0 \u2264 y=k -x \u2264b-1.\n\nSo perhaps this is a better way to compute the number of solutions.\n\nLet me try to compute for b= 121 (b-1=120):\n\nWe need to find all k such that:\n\nk(k-1) divisible by120,\n\nand 1 \u2264 (k\u00b2 -k)/120 \u2264120,\n\nand 0 \u2264k - (k\u00b2 -k)/120 \u2264120.\n\nLet me compute k such that k(k-1) divisible by120.\n\nSince 120= 2^3*3*5,\n\nso k and k-1 must cover the factors.\n\nSince k and k-1 are coprime,\n\none of them must be divisible by8,\n\none divisible by3,\n\nand one divisible by5.\n\nThus possible scenarios:\n\nCase1: k divisible by8,3,5,\n\nCase2: k divisible by8 and3, and k-1 divisible by5,\n\nCase3: k divisible by8 and5, and k-1 divisible by3,\n\nCase4: k divisible by3 and5, and k-1 divisible by8,\n\nCase5: k divisible by8, and k-1 divisible by3 and5,\n\nCase6: k divisible by3, and k-1 divisible by8 and5,\n\nCase7: k divisible by5, and k-1 divisible by8 and3,\n\nCase8: k-1 divisible by8,3,5.\n\nThis is getting complex, but let's find possible k's:\n\nLet me look for k where k(k-1) divisible by120.\n\nPossible k's:\n\nk= 16:15\u00d716=240. 240 divisible by120.

Hmm.\n\nWait, but earlier I had 7 solutions via another method. Discrepancy.\n\nWait, m=35 gives x=13 via m(m+1)=35*36=1260=120*10.5\u2192 no. Wait, no. Wait k=40 gives x=13.\n\nYes, so the k method gives 6 solutions. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming manually. Perhaps the minimal b is 253, but with only 7 solutions. Maybe I need to look for b where b-1 is a multiple of many numbers, like b-1=2520, which has many divisors. But this is too big.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but it has only 6 solutions. Wait, maybe my earlier approach was wrong.\n\nWait, let me think differently.\n\nSuppose we need more than 10 solutions. Let's consider that for each divisor d of (b-1), there is a solution when x=d. But not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, think of x and y such that x + y = sqrt(x*b + y).\n\nLet me denote k =x + y,\n\nthen, k^2 =x*b + y,\n\nbut y =k -x,\n\nso substituting,\n\nk^2 =x*b +k -x,\n\n=>k^2 -k =x*(b -1),\n\nthus x=(k^2 -k)/(b-1),\n\nand y= k -x,\n\nso y must be between0 and b-1,\n\nso the constraints are:\n\n1. (k^2 -k) must be divisible by (b-1),\n\n2. 1 \u2264x=(k^2 -k)/(b-1) \u2264b-1,\n\n3. 0 \u2264 y=k -x \u2264b-1.\n\nThus for each b, the number of solutions is the number of integers k such that these conditions hold.\n\nTherefore, we can think of k as any integer where k^2 -k is divisible by (b-1), and the corresponding x and y are within the required ranges.\n\nTo have many solutions, (b-1) should have many divisors, so that there are many k's such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nThe number of solutions will be the number of such k's.\n\nThe minimal b where the number exceeds 10 would correspond to the first b where (b-1) has so many factors that there are over 10 such k's.\n\nThe number of solutions is roughly the number of divisors of (b-1), but not exactly.\n\nThe number of solutions is equal to the number of integers k such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and x and y are valid.\n\nBut since k can be up to roughly sqrt(b^2), but since n =k\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which is at most b^2-1, so k can be up to b.\n\nWait, since n is a two-digit number in base b, the maximum n is b^2 -1, so sqrt(n) can be up to b. Thus k can be from 2 up to b (since x and y are at least 1 and 0, so sum is at least 1).\n\nTherefore, the possible k's are integers from2 to b.\n\nThus, for each b, the number of solutions is the number of integers k in [2, b] such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and x=(k^2 -k)/(b-1) is between1 and b-1, and y=k -x is between0 and b-1.\n\nThe key condition is divisibility of (k^2 -k) by (b-1).\n\nThus, to maximize the number of solutions, (b-1) should divide as many (k^2 -k) terms as possible for k from 2 to b.\n\nThe number of solutions is thus the number of k in 2 \u2264k \u2264b such that (k^2 -k) mod (b-1)=0.\n\nLet me denote d =b-1.\n\nThus we need the number of integers k in 2 \u2264k \u2264d+1 such that (k^2 -k) \u22610 mod d.\n\nLet me set k varies from 2 to d+1,\n\nand we need k(k-1) \u22610 mod d.\n\nThus, for each d (b-1), the number of k in [2, d+1] such that k(k-1) \u22610 mod d.\n\nWe need this count >10.\n\nTo find the minimal d (d+1) such that this count exceeds10.\n\nWe need to find minimal d where the number of solutions is >10.\n\nThis problem now reduces to finding the smallest d where the number of k in [2, d+1] with k(k-1) divisible by d exceeds10.\n\nThis is a number theory problem.\n\nNote that k(k-1) is divisible by d iff d divides k(k-1).\n\nSince k and k-1 are coprime,\n\nd must divide either k or k-1.\n\nThus, for each d, the number of k in [2, d+1] where k \u22610 mod d or k \u22611 mod d.\n\nWait, because if d divides k(k-1), since gcd(k,k-1)=1,\n\nthen d must divide k or divide k-1.\n\nThus, the solutions are all k \u22610 mod d or k\u22611 mod d within the interval [2, d+1].\n\nNow, since k ranges from2 to d+1:\n\nThe numbers congruent to0 mod d in [2, d+1] are k=d and k=2d (but 2d >d+1 since d\u22652).\n\nThus only k=d.\n\nThe numbers congruent to1 mod d in [2, d+1]:\n\nThese are k=1 + md for integer m such that 2 \u2264k \u2264d+1.\n\nThe smallest k\u22611 mod d is k=1 (but starts at 2), so next is k=1 +d =d+1.\n\nThus, the numbers congruent to1 mod d are k=d+1.\n\nThus, the numbers k in [2, d+1] where k \u22610 mod d or 1 mod d are:\n\nk=d and k=d+1.\n\nThus, there are only two solutions for any d\u22652.\n\nWait, that's a problem. That would mean that for any d=b-1\u22652,\n\nthe number of solutions is 2, from k=d and k=d+1.\n\nBut that contradicts previous examples.\n\nWait, where is the mistake?\n\nWait, in the logic above, I assumed that since d divides k(k-1) and gcd(k,k-1)=1,\n\nthen d must divide k or d divides k-1.\n\nThat part is correct.\n\nThus, the solutions are k \u22610 mod d or k\u22611 mod d.\n\nHowever, in the interval [2, d+1], the numbers congruent to0 mod d are k=d,\n\nand congruent to1 mod d are k=d+1 (since 1 mod d is 1, but starts at 2).\n\nThus, indeed only two solutions: k=d and k=d+1.\n\nBut in the examples:\n\nFor b=13 (d=12):\n\nk can be 12 or13.\n\nk=12:\n\nx=(12\u00b2-12)/12= (144-12)/12=132/12=11.\n\ny=12-11=1. Thus valid. (Solution: x=11,y=1)\n\nk=13:\n\nx=(13\u00b2-13)/12=(169-13)/12=156/12=13.\n\nBut x=13 exceeds b-1=12, so it's invalid.\n\nThus only one solution from k=d=12,\n\nbut earlier there were three solutions.\n\nWait, this contradicts.\n\nHmm, so my logic must be wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the mistake is that the condition is that d divides k(k-1),\n\nbut even if d doesn't divide k or k-1 individually,\n\nit could divide their product.\n\nSince d divides k(k-1), but since gcd(k,k-1)=1,\n\nthen d must divide k or d divides k-1,\n\nbut this is only if d is square-free?\n\nWait no, actually in general,\n\nif d divides the product of two coprimes a and b,\n\nthen d must divide a or b.\n\nYes, that's a theorem.\n\nThus, the previous reasoning holds.\n\nThus, why in the case of b=13 (d=12):\n\nThe solutions are k=12 and k=13,\n\nbut k=12 gives x=11,y=1,\n\nand k=13 gives x=13 (invalid).\n\nBut there are other solutions, such as k=6:\n\nWait, for b=13, d=12.\n\nk=6:\n\nk(k-1)=30,\n\n30 mod12=6\u22600,\n\nso not divisible.\n\nAnother solution is k=8:\n\nk=8, k(k-1)=56,\n\n56 mod12=8\u22600,\n\nno.\n\nWait, but earlier for b=13, we had three solutions:\n\nk=3 (x=1,y=2? Wait no.\n\nWait, the three solutions were:\n\nfor m=3, x=1, y=3: corresponds to k= x+y=4,\n\nso k=4.\n\nk=4:\n\nk(k-1)=4*3=12 divisible by12. Yes.\n\nThus k=4 is also a solution.\n\nBut according to previous logic, k must be \u22610 or1 mod12.\n\n4 mod12 is4\u22600 or1,\n\nso why is k=4 a solution?\n\nAh! Because d=12 is not prime. So the factors may split between k and k-1.\n\nWait, in this case, d=12=3\u00d74,\n\nk=4 and k-1=3,\n\nso 3 divides k-1 and 4 divides k,\n\nthus 12 divides k(k-1).\n\nHence even though k is not 0 or1 mod12,\n\nthe factors can be split between k and k-1.\n\nSo my previous logic was incorrect: the condition d divides k(k-1) is equivalent to for every prime power p^e dividing d,\n\np^e divides k or p^e divides k-1.\n\nThus, the solutions are more than just k\u22610 or1 mod d.\n\nThus, I need to revise the approach.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is the number of k in [2, d+1] such that for every prime power dividing d,\n\neither p^e divides k or p^e divides k-1.\n\nThis is more complex.\n\nTo compute this, perhaps it's best to consider the multiplicative factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of d.\n\nWait, for d=12,\n\nthe solutions k are:\n\nk=4, 3, 9, 12, 13.\n\nWait for b=13 (d=12):\n\nValid k's are:\n\nk=4:4\u00d73 divisible by12,\n\nk= 9:9\u00d78=72 divisible by12,\n\nk=12,\n\nk=13,\n\nand k= 3:3\u00d72=6 not divisible by12,\n\nk= 8:8\u00d77=56 not divisible by12,\n\nk=6:6\u00d75=30 not divisible by12,\n\nk=4: yes, 4\u00d73=12.\n\nThus, k=4,9,12,13.\n\nThus four solutions for d=12:\n\nk=4 (x=(16-4)/12=12/12=1 \u2192x=1,y=3),\n\nk=9 (x=(81-9)/12=72/12=6 \u2192x=6,y=3),\n\nk=12 ( x=11,y=1),\n\nk=13 (x=13, invalid),\n\nThus 3 valid solutions (excluding k=13).\n\nThus the number of valid k's is equal to the number of integers k in [2,d+1] such that k(k-1) divisible by d, minus those where x exceeds b-1.\n\nThis is getting too involved.\n\nPerhaps the minimal b where the count exceeds 10 is 253, with d=252.\n\nGiven that 252 has many factors, the number of k's would be large.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal b is 121 (d=120), which has 6 solutions,\n\nthen 253 (d=252) has 12 solutions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 121, but my manual count might have missed some.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 253.\n\nAlternatively, the first b where the number of solutions exceeds10 is when d=252 (b=253).\n\nBut without precise calculation, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that when d is a factorial, which has many factors, the number of solutions increases.\n\nLet me try d=24 (b=25):\n\nThe number of solutions is the number of k in [2,25] where 24 divides k(k-1).\n\nFactors of24= 2^3\u00d73.\n\nThe solutions are k such that:\n\nFor each prime power:\n\n- 8 divides k or k-1,\n\n- 3 divides k or k-1.\n\nThus:\n\nEither:\n\nCase1: 8 divides k and 3 divides k,\n\nor\n\nCase2:8 divides k and 3 divides (k-1),\n\nor\n\nCase3:8 divides (k-1) and3 divides k,\n\nor\n\nCase4:8 divides (k-1) and3 divides (k-1).\n\nThus possible k's are those where:\n\nEither:\n\nk \u22610 mod8 and k\u22610 mod3,\n\nor\n\nk\u22610 mod8 and k\u22611 mod3,\n\nor\n\nk\u22611 mod8 and k\u22610 mod3,\n\nor\n\nk\u22611 mod8 and k\u22611 mod3.\n\nSolving these congruences:\n\nCase1: k \u22610 mod24,\n\nk=24.\n\nCase2: k\u22610 mod8 and k\u22611 mod3:\n\nLet k=8m,\n\n8m\u22611 mod3 \u21d22m\u22611 mod3 \u21d2m\u22612 mod3,\n\nso m=3n+2 \u21d2k=8*(3n+2)=24n+16,\n\nwithin 2-25:\n\nn=0:16,\n\nn=1:40 (too big).\n\nThus k=16.\n\nCase3:k\u22611 mod8 and k\u22610 mod3,\n\nLet k=8m+1,\n\n8m+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d22m+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d22m\u22612 mod3 \u21d2m\u22611 mod3,\n\nm=3n+1 \u21d2k=8*(3n+1)+1=24n+9,\n\nwithin 2-25:\n\nn=0:9,\n\nn=1:33 (too big).\n\nThus k=9.\n\nCase4: k\u22611 mod8 and k\u22611 mod3,\n\nk=8m+1,\n\n8m+1\u22611 mod3 \u21d22m\u22610 mod3 \u21d2m\u22610 mod3,\n\nm=3n \u21d2k=24n+1,\n\nwithin 2-25:\n\nn=0:1 (exceeds lower bound? k must be \u22652),\n\nn=1:25.\n\nThus k=25.\n\nThus total solutions are k=9,16,24,25.\n\nThus for d=24 (b=25), valid k's:\n\nk=9 (x=(81-9)/24=72/24=3 \u2192y=6),\n\nk=16 (x= (256-16)/24=240/24=10 \u2192y=6),\n\nk=24 (x=(576-24)/24=552/24=23 \u2192y=1),\n\nk=25 (x=(625-25)/24=600/24=25 \u2192exceeds b-1=24 \u2192invalid).\n\nThus three solutions (k=9,16,24) for b=25.\n\nThus, it's clear that the number of solutions is related to the number of factor combinations of d.\n\nTo get over 10 solutions, d must be a number with many factor combinations.\n\nThe minimal d that allows more than10 solutions is likely 2520 (b=2521), but that's too large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps d= 240 (b=241):\n\n240 factors:2^4 *3*5.\n\nThe number of solutions would be the number of k in [2, 241] with 240 divides k(k-1).\n\nThe number of solutions would be the number of k such that for each prime power:\n\n-16 divides k or k-1,\n\n-3 divides k or k-1,\n\n-5 divides k or k-1.\n\nThis would give multiple cases,\n\nleading to many solutions.\n\nBut without calculating, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different approach.\n\nLet me revisit the equation:\n\n(x + y)^2 =x*b + y.\n\nLet me consider that y = sqrt(n) -x,\n\nand n =x*b + y =x*b + sqrt(n) -x,\n\nRearranged:\n\nn - sqrt(n) =x*(b-1),\n\nsince n =k^2,\n\nk^2 -k =x*(b-1).\n\nThus, x=(k^2 -k)/(b-1).\n\nSince x must be an integer between1 and b-1,\n\nthis implies that (k^2 -k) must be divisible by(b-1).\n\nMoreover, since y=sqrt(n) -x =k -x must be between0 and b-1,\n\nso 0 \u2264k -x \u2264b-1,\n\nbut x=(k^2 -k)/(b-1),\n\nso:\n\n0 \u2264k - (k^2 -k)/(b-1) \u2264b-1,\n\nLet me denote d =b-1,\n\nthen,\n\n0 \u2264k - (k\u00b2 -k)/d \u2264d,\n\nMultiply by d:\n\n0 \u2264d*k -k\u00b2 +k \u2264d\u00b2,\n\nSimplify:\n\n0 \u2264-k\u00b2 + (d+1)k \u2264d\u00b2,\n\nWhich implies:\n\nk\u00b2 - (d+1)k \u22640,\n\nand\n\n-k\u00b2 + (d+1)k -d\u00b2 \u22640.\n\nThe first inequality k\u00b2 - (d+1)k \u22640,\n\nk(k - (d+1)) \u22640,\n\nwhich holds for 0 \u2264k \u2264d+1,\n\nwhich is already within our k's range.\n\nThe second inequality:\n\n-k\u00b2 + (d+1)k -d\u00b2 \u22640,\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\nk\u00b2 - (d+1)k +d\u00b2 \u22650,\n\nThis is a quadratic in k,\n\ndiscriminant=(d+1)^2 -4d\u00b2= d\u00b2 +2d +1 -4d\u00b2= -3d\u00b2 +2d +1,\n\nThis discriminant is negative for large d,\n\nso the quadratic is always positive.\n\nThus the inequality holds,\n\nso the condition reduces to 0 \u2264k \u2264d+1.\n\nThus the only constraints are:\n\n1. (k^2 -k) must be divisible byd,\n\n2. 1 \u2264x=(k^2 -k)/d \u2264d,\n\n3. 0 \u2264k -x \u2264d.\n\nBut since x=(k^2 -k)/d,\n\nthen k -x =k - (k^2 -k)/d =k*(1 - (k-1)/d).\n\nBut since y must be non-negative,\n\nk - (k^2 -k)/d \u22650,\n\nk*(d - (k-1)) \u22650,\n\nsince k\u22650,\n\nthen d - (k-1) \u22650,\n\nk \u2264d+1,\n\nwhich is already satisfied.\n\nThus the main constraints are divisibility and x \u2264d.\n\nThus the number of solutions is the number of integers k between 2 and d+1,\n\nsuch that d divides(k^2 -k),\n\nand x=(k^2 -k)/d \u2264d.\n\nThis second condition:\n\n(k^2 -k)/d \u2264d,\n\nk^2 -k \u2264d\u00b2,\n\nk^2 -k -d\u00b2 \u22640,\n\nThe roots of the equation k^2 -k -d\u00b2=0 are:\n\nk=(1 \u00b1sqrt(1+4d\u00b2))/2,\n\nPositive root is approx sqrt(d\u00b2)=d,\n\nThus for k \u2264d+1,\n\nthis inequality holds,\n\nso the condition is automatically satisfied for k \u2264d+1.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is exactly the number of integers k between2 and d+1 such that d divides(k^2 -k).\n\nThus, to find the minimal d where the number of such k's exceeds10,\n\nwe need to find the smallest d where there are over10 k's between2 and d+1 with d dividing k(k-1).\n\nThis is equivalent to finding the number of solutions to k\u22610 mod d or k\u22611 mod d,\n\nplus any other solutions where the factors of d are distributed between k and k-1.\n\nThis requires that d has many factors, allowing multiple k's to split the factors between k and k-1.\n\nThe minimal d where this count exceeds10 is likely a highly composite number.\n\nThe first few highly composite numbers are 1,2,4,6,12,24,36,48,60,120,180,240,360, etc.\n\nLet's try d=60 (b=61):\n\nThe number of solutions is the number of k between2 and61 such that60 dividesk(k-1).\n\n60=2^2*3*5.\n\nThe solutions are k such that:\n\n- 4 divides k or k-1,\n\n- 3 divides k or k-1,\n\n-5 divides k or k-1.\n\nThis is similar to previous cases.\n\nThe number of solutions can be calculated by inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe total number of k's where k\u22610 mod4 or1 mod4,\n\nand similarly for 3 and5.\n\nThis is complex but let's try:\n\nThe number of solutions is equal to the number of k in2 to61 where:\n\nfor each prime power in60,\n\nthe factors are split between k or k-1.\n\nThis requires solving the system of congruences for each combination.\n\nThe total number would be the product over each prime power of (number of choices for each prime power) minus overlaps.\n\nThis would take time, but let's estimate.\n\nFor each prime power:\n\n- For 4: must be in k or k-1,\n\n- For3: must be in k or k-1,\n\n- For5: must be in k or k-1.\n\nThus, the total number of solutions is 2^3=8 possibilities,\n\neach combination corresponds to a congruence system.\n\nFor each combination of choosing for each prime whether it divides k or k-1,\n\nthe number of solutions is the number of k in [2,d+1] satisfying the congruences.\n\nEach combination gives one congruence:\n\nFor example,\n\nchoose 4 divides k,\n\n3 divides k,\n\n5 divides k,\n\nthen k\u22610 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60,\n\nthus k=60.\n\nAnother combination:\n\n4 divides k,\n\n3 divides k,\n\n5 divides k-1,\n\nthen:\n\nk\u22610 mod4,\n\nk\u22610 mod3,\n\nk\u22611 mod5,\n\nsolve these:\n\nk\u22610 mod12,\n\nk\u22611 mod5,\n\nLet k=12m,\n\n12m\u22611 mod5 \u21d22m\u22611 mod5 \u21d2m\u22613 mod5,\n\nso m=5n+3,\n\nk=12*(5n+3)=60n+36,\n\nwithin 2-61:\n\nn=0:36,\n\nn=1:96>61.\n\nThus k=36.\n\nSimilarly, each combination will give one solution in the range.\n\nThere are 2^3=8 combinations,\n\neach corresponding to one solution,\n\nso total solutions are8,\n\nplus perhaps overlaps?\n\nWait, when all prime powers choose to divide k-1,\n\nthen k\u22611 mod4,\n\nk\u22611 mod3,\n\nk\u22611 mod5,\n\nso k\u22611 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60,\n\nthus k=1 or61,\n\nbut k\u22652,\n\nso k=61.\n\nThus total solutions are 8+1=9?\n\nWait, perhaps each combination gives exactly one solution,\n\nso total 2^3=8 solutions,\n\nplus the case when all choose k-1,\n\nwhich gives k=1+60=61,\n\nso total 8+1=9 solutions.\n\nThus for d=60,\n\nthere are9 solutions,\n\nstill below10.\n\nNext d=120 (b=121):\n\nd=120=2^3*3*5.\n\nThe number of divisors combinations is more.\n\nThe number of solutions would be 2^3 (for prime powers 8,3,5) \u2192 8,\n\nbut also considering the exponents.\n\nActually, the prime power factors are 8,3,5.\n\nThus,\n\nfor each of the three prime powers (8,3,5),\n\ndecide whether they divide k or k-1,\n\nso 2^3=8 combinations,\n\neach gives a solution,\n\nplus the case when all choose k-1,\n\ngiving k=1 mod120 \u21d2k=121,\n\nwhich is valid.\n\nThus total solutions 8+1=9.\n\nStill 9.\n\nHmm.\n\nNext d=240 (b=241):\n\nd=240=2^4*3*5.\n\nPrime powers:16,3,5.\n\nThus 2^3=8 combinations,\n\nplus the k=241,\n\ntotal 9.\n\nNot enough.\n\nNext d= 360 (b=361):\n\nd=360=2^3*3^2*5.\n\nPrime powers:8,9,5.\n\nThus

841.\n\nBut the problem asks for the least b\u22652 with more than ten b-eautiful integers.\n\nThus, the answer is 841.\n\nWait, but the problem might have a smaller b.\n\nWait, let's try d= 360

not.\n\nd= 960 (b=961):\n\n960=2^6\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nPrime powers:64,3,5.\n\nThus three,\n\n2^3=8,\n\nplus 1,\n\ntotal9.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, what about d= 120 (b=121) had 9 solutions,\n\nd= 240 (b=241) also 9,\n\nd= 360 (9),\n\nd= 480 (b=481):\n\n480=2^5\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nPrime powers:32,3,5.\n\nThus three,\n\n2^3=8 +1=9.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the first d with four distinct prime factors.\n\nd= 840 (2^3,3,5,7),\n\nthen 2^4=16 solutions plus one,\n\ntotal17.\n\nThus the minimal b is 841.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"more than ten\", so 11 or more,\n\nso 17 is enough.\n\nBut 841 is quite large.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed a smaller d with four prime factors.\n\nThe first d with four distinct prime factors is 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210.\n\nCheck d=210 (b=211):\n\n210=2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77.\n\nPrime powers:2,3,5,7.\n\nThus four prime factors.\n\nThus the number of solutions is 2^4=16 (each prime divides either k or k-1),\n\nplus k=211,\n\ntotal17 solutions.\n\nThus b=211.\n\nThis is smaller.\n\nWait, so for d=210,\n\nprime factors are 2,3,5,7.\n\nThus for each prime,\n\nchoose whether it divides k or k-1,\n\nthis gives 2^4=16 possibilities,\n\neach corresponds to a congruence system,\n\nwhich has a unique solution mod 210,\n\nthus within 2-211,\n\neach congruence system will have exactly one solution except possibly overlapping at the endpoints.\n\nFor example,\n\nthe case where all primes divide k,\n\ngives k=0 mod210 \u21d2k=210,\n\nand the case where all divide k-1,\n\ngives k=1 mod210 \u21d2k=211.\n\nThus

k=0 mod210 (k=210),\n\nso total16+2=18.\n\nWait, but when all primes divide k,\n\nk=0 mod210 \u21d2k=210,\n\nwhich is within the range,\n\nand when all divide k-1,\n\nk=1 mod210 \u21d2k=211,\n\nalso included.\n\nThus total solutions are18,\n\nwhich is more than10.\n\nThus the minimal b=211.\n\nWait, this is better.\n\nSimilarly, d= 210 is the first to have four prime factors,\n\nso gives 16+2=18 solutions.\n\nThus b=211 is the minimal.\n\nBut is there a smaller d with four prime factors?\n\nThe smallest d with four distinct primes is 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210,\n\nso yes.\n\nThus the minimal b is211.\n\nWait,\n\nchecking with d= 210 (b=211):\n\nNumber of solutions is 16+2=18.\n\nYes.\n\nThus the answer is211.\n\nBut let me confirm with d= 210.\n\nThe number of solutions is 2^4=16 (each prime factor can be assigned to k or k-1),\n\nplus the two edge cases (k=210 and k=211).\n\nWait, but the edge cases are already included in the 16?\n\nNo,\n\neach assignment of the four primes to k

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. \n\nA number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when you write n in base b, it has exactly two digits. That means n is between b^1 and b^2 - 1, right? Because in base b, a two-digit number would be from 10_b (which is b in decimal) up to (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 -1. \n\nSecond condition: the sum of its two digits equals the square root of n. So, if the two digits in base b are, say, d1 and d2 (with d1 being the first digit, so it can't be zero), then d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). \n\nThe example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6+3=9, which is the square root of 81. That checks out. \n\nSo, the task is to find the smallest base b where there are more than 10 such numbers. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to model this mathematically. Let me denote the two digits in base b as a and c. Since it's a two-digit number in base b, the number n can be written as n = a*b + c, where a is between 1 and b-1 (since leading digit can't be zero), and c is between 0 and b-1. \n\nThe second condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). Since sqrt(n) must be an integer because a and c are integers, so n must be a perfect square. Let me note that down: n must be a perfect square. So, sqrt(n) is an integer, say k. Therefore, the equation becomes a + c = k, and n = k^2. But also, n = a*b + c. \n\nSo substituting n, we have a*b + c = k^2, and a + c = k. Let me write these two equations:\n\n1. a + c = k\n2. a*b + c = k^2\n\nWe can substitute c from the first equation into the second. Since c = k - a, substituting into the second equation gives:\n\na*b + (k - a) = k^2  \n=> a*b - a + k = k^2  \n=> a*(b - 1) + k = k^2  \n=> a*(b - 1) = k^2 - k  \n=> a = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, okay. Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, the right-hand side (k^2 -k)/(b -1) must be an integer in that range. Similarly, c = k - a must also be between 0 and b-1. \n\nSo, for given b, we can look for integers k such that:\n\n1. k^2 = a*b + c, where 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1\n2. a + c = k\n\nAlternatively, since we have a = (k^2 -k)/(b-1), we can think of it as for each possible k, if (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), then a is an integer, and then we can check if a and c are within their respective ranges. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express this as:\n\nFrom the equations:\n\nWe have a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1). Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, then (k^2 -k) must be divisible by (b-1), and the result must be between 1 and b-1. \n\nSo, let's reorganize:\n\nLet me denote m = b -1. Then b = m +1. \n\nThen, the equation a = (k^2 -k)/m must be integer, and 1 \u2264 a \u2264 m. \n\nAlso, since c = k - a, then c must be between 0 and m (since c < b = m +1). \n\nTherefore, for each m = b -1, we can look for integers k such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by m, and then a = (k^2 -k)/m must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 m, and c = k - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 m. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps another way to approach this is to note that since n = k^2 = a*b + c and a + c = k, then substituting c = k - a into n gives n = a*b + (k - a) = a*(b -1) + k. But n is also k^2, so:\n\nk^2 = a*(b -1) + k  \n=> k^2 - k = a*(b -1)\n\nWhich again gives a = (k^2 -k)/(b -1). \n\nTherefore, for each k, the possible a and b would be such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1). So for a given b, the possible k's are those for which (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and then the corresponding a and c must be in their ranges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, we can iterate over possible k's and check if a is integer and within the required range. \n\nBut since we need to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, perhaps we can approach this by considering for each b starting from 2 upwards, compute how many such numbers exist, and stop when we hit the first b with more than 10. \n\nBut doing this manually for each b might be tedious, but maybe we can find a pattern or a formula. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express the problem in terms of k and m (where m = b -1). Let me see:\n\nGiven m = b -1, so b = m +1, and then a = (k^2 -k)/m must be integer between 1 and m. \n\nAlso, c = k - a must be between 0 and m. \n\nTherefore, substituting a into c:\n\nc = k - (k^2 -k)/m  \n= [ m*k - (k^2 -k) ] / m  \n= [ m*k -k^2 +k ] / m  \n= [ -k^2 +k(m +1) ] / m  \nHmm, but not sure if that helps. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the equation k^2 -k must be divisible by m, so (k^2 -k) mod m =0. \n\nSo for each m (since m = b-1, m \u22651), we can look for integers k where k(k -1) \u22610 mod m, and then the corresponding a must be between 1 and m, and c between 0 and m. \n\nAdditionally, since n = k^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b and b^2 -1. Since n =k^2, so:\n\nb \u2264 k^2 \u2264 b^2 -1\n\nBut b = m +1, so substituting:\n\nm +1 \u2264 k^2 \u2264 (m +1)^2 -1 = m^2 + 2m\n\nWait, but m = b -1, so in terms of m, the lower bound is m +1 \u2264 k^2, upper bound is (m+1)^2 -1 = m^2 + 2m. \n\nTherefore, k must satisfy sqrt(m +1) \u2264 k \u2264 sqrt(m^2 + 2m). Since sqrt(m^2 +2m) is approximately m +1, so k can be up to m+1. \n\nWait, sqrt(m^2 + 2m) = sqrt{(m+1)^2 -1} < m +1. So the upper bound for k is floor(sqrt(m^2 +2m)) which would be m. Since (m+1)^2 is (m^2 +2m +1), so m^2 +2m is less than that. \n\nWait, but the upper bound is (m+1)^2 -1, so the maximum possible k such that k^2 \u2264 (m+1)^2 -1 is k_max = floor( sqrt{(m+1)^2 -1} ). Since sqrt{(m+1)^2 -1} is between m and m+1, so floor is m. \n\nTherefore, k can range from ceil( sqrt(m+1) ) up to m. \n\nSo for each m, the possible k's are integers k with ceil( sqrt(m +1) ) \u2264k \u2264 m. \n\nTherefore, for each m, the possible k's are in that interval. For each such k, check if (k^2 -k) is divisible by m. If yes, then compute a = (k^2 -k)/m. Then check if a is between 1 and m (since a must be at least 1 and at most m), and then check if c =k -a is between 0 and m. \n\nWait, but since a = (k^2 -k)/m, and since (k^2 -k) is divisible by m, then a is an integer. Since k \u2264 m, then:\n\nLet me see, since k \u2264 m, then:\n\nk^2 - k \u2264 m^2 -k. Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to think numerically. \n\nAlternatively, let me see that since a = (k^2 -k)/m, and since m = b -1, and since a must be at least 1, so (k^2 -k)/m \u22651 => k^2 -k \u2265 m. But m = b -1 and b = m +1, so this is k^2 -k \u2265 m. Not sure if that helps. \n\nAlternatively, since c = k - a, and c must be between 0 and m (since c is a digit in base b = m+1, so c < b = m+1). So 0 \u2264 c \u2264 m. \n\nTherefore, c = k - a \u22650 \u21d2 a \u2264k. \n\nSimilarly, c \u2264 m \u21d2 k -a \u2264 m \u21d2 a \u2265k -m. \n\nSince a is positive, so a \u2265 max(1, k - m). \n\nBut since a = (k^2 -k)/m, then:\n\nk - m \u2264 (k^2 -k)/m \n\nMultiply both sides by m (since m is positive):\n\nm(k - m) \u2264k^2 -k \n\n=> mk - m^2 \u2264k^2 -k \n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nmk - m^2 -k^2 +k \u22640 \n\n=> -k^2 + mk +k -m^2 \u22640 \n\nHmm, not sure if this is helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think that since a must be between 1 and m, and c between 0 and m, so let's see:\n\nGiven a = (k^2 -k)/m, then:\n\n1 \u2264 (k^2 -k)/m \u2264 m \n\nMultiply all terms by m (since m is positive):\n\nm \u2264k^2 -k \u2264 m^2 \n\nSo, the inequalities are:\n\nk^2 -k \u2265 m \n\nand \n\nk^2 -k \u2264 m^2 \n\nSo, these are constraints on k given m. \n\nAdditionally, from the digit constraints, since c = k - a must be between 0 and m, so:\n\n0 \u2264k - a \u2264m \n\nSubstitute a = (k^2 -k)/m:\n\n0 \u2264k - (k^2 -k)/m \u2264m \n\nMultiply through by m (positive):\n\n0 \u2264m k - (k^2 -k) \u2264m^2 \n\nSo:\n\nLeft inequality: m k -k^2 +k \u22650 \u21d2 -k^2 + (m +1)k \u22650 \u21d2 k( (m +1) -k ) \u22650 \n\nSince k is positive, this implies (m +1) -k \u22650 \u21d2 k \u2264m +1. Which is already true since k \u2264m (from the earlier upper bound of k \u2264 m). \n\nRight inequality: m k -k^2 +k \u2264m^2 \u21d2 -k^2 + (m +1)k -m^2 \u22640 \n\nMultiply by -1 reverses inequality:\n\nk^2 - (m +1)k +m^2 \u22650 \n\nHmm, quadratic in k. Let's check discriminant: \n\nDiscriminant D = (m +1)^2 -4*1*m^2 = m^2 +2m +1 -4m^2 = -3m^2 +2m +1 \n\nHmm, discriminant is negative when -3m\u00b2 +2m +1 <0. Let's see for m \u22651:\n\nAt m=1: D = -3 +2 +1=0\n\nAt m=2: D= -12 +4 +1= -7 <0\n\nSo for m \u22652, discriminant is negative. Therefore, the quadratic k^2 - (m +1)k +m^2 is always positive (since leading coefficient is positive and no real roots). Therefore, the inequality k^2 - (m +1)k +m^2 \u22650 is always true for real k. \n\nTherefore, the right inequality holds automatically. \n\nTherefore, the constraints on k are:\n\nFrom the first inequality:\n\nk^2 -k \u2265 m \n\nand from the second inequality (from a \u2264 m):\n\nk^2 -k \u2264 m\u00b2 \n\nand from the original digit constraints, since:\n\na must be between 1 and m, so (k\u00b2 -k)/m between 1 and m. \n\nSo, to recap, for each m (so b = m+1), the possible k's are integers between ceil( sqrt(m +1) ) and m, such that:\n\n1. k\u00b2 -k \u2265 m \n\n2. k\u00b2 -k \u2264 m\u00b2 \n\nand \n\n3. (k\u00b2 -k) must be divisible by m. \n\nAdditionally, when we compute a = (k\u00b2 -k)/m, then c =k -a must be between 0 and m (but as we saw, c =k - a = k - (k\u00b2 -k)/m. Let me see if that can be written differently:\n\nc = k - (k\u00b2 -k)/m = [m k -k\u00b2 +k]/m = [ -k\u00b2 +k(m +1) ] / m \n\nHmm, which is the same as before. \n\nAlternatively, since c must be between 0 and m:\n\n0 \u2264 [ -k\u00b2 +k(m +1) ] / m \u2264 m \n\nMultiply by m (positive):\n\n0 \u2264 -k\u00b2 +k(m +1) \u2264 m\u00b2 \n\nLeft inequality: -k\u00b2 +k(m +1) \u22650 \u21d2 k\u00b2 -k(m +1) \u22640 \u21d2 k(k - (m +1)) \u22640 \n\nSince k is positive and \u2264m, then k \u2264 m < m +1, so (k - (m +1)) is negative. Therefore, k(k - (m +1)) \u22640 holds. \n\nRight inequality: -k\u00b2 +k(m +1) \u2264m\u00b2 \u21d2 -k\u00b2 +k(m +1) -m\u00b2 \u22640 \u21d2 \n\nLet me rearrange: \n\n-k\u00b2 + (m +1)k -m\u00b2 \u22640 \n\nMultiply by -1: \n\nk\u00b2 - (m +1)k + m\u00b2 \u22650 \n\nWhich again, as before, since discriminant is negative, this is always true. \n\nTherefore, the constraints on k are just:\n\n1. k must be integer between ceil( sqrt(m +1) ) and m \n\n2. k\u00b2 -k must be divisible by m \n\n3. Additionally, a = (k\u00b2 -k)/m must be between 1 and m (since a is a digit in the first place, can't be zero). \n\nWait, actually, since a must be at least 1 and at most m (since a is the first digit in base b, which has digits from 1 to m). \n\nTherefore, the main constraints are:\n\n- k is an integer in [ceil(sqrt(m +1)), m]\n\n- (k\u00b2 -k) mod m =0 \n\n- 1 \u2264 (k\u00b2 -k)/m \u2264 m \n\nSo, for each m, we can iterate over k in that interval and check these conditions. \n\nOur goal is to find the minimal b = m +1 such that the number of such k's (and hence the number of b-eautiful numbers) exceeds 10. \n\nTherefore, perhaps we can model this as, for each m starting from 1 (so b=2), compute the number of valid k's for each m, and find the smallest m where this count exceeds 10. Then the answer is m+1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way than brute force. \n\nAlternatively, note that for each k, the equation (k\u00b2 -k) must be divisible by m. \n\nSo, equivalently, m divides (k\u00b2 -k). \n\nSo, m | k(k -1). \n\nTherefore, for each k, the divisors m (i.e., m divides k(k-1)). \n\nBut since m must be between, given k, m can be any divisor of k(k-1). But since m is also related to k via m = b -1 and the constraints on m and k. \n\nAlternatively, since m is the divisor of k(k-1), and m must be between (k^2 -k)/m \u2264 m, so m^2 \u2265 k^2 -k \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to proceed step by step. Let's see if we can find expressions for m in terms of k. \n\nAlternatively, since m divides k(k -1), so m must be a divisor of k(k-1). \n\nAdditionally, from the equation a = (k\u00b2 -k)/m must be between 1 and m. So (k\u00b2 -k)/m \u2264 m \u21d2 k\u00b2 -k \u2264 m\u00b2. \n\nBut since m divides k(k-1), so m \u2264 k(k-1). \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe the best way is to try small values of b (starting from 2 upwards) and count the number of b-eautiful numbers until we find the first b where the count exceeds 10. \n\nStarting with b=2:\n\nCase b=2:\n\nThen m =1. \n\nSo m=1, so the possible k's must be between ceil(sqrt(1+1)) = ceil(sqrt(2)) \u22482, but m=1, so the upper limit is m=1. But 2 >1, so no possible k. Therefore, zero numbers. \n\nSo b=2 has 0.\n\nb=3 (m=2):\n\nPossible k between ceil(sqrt(2+1))=ceil(sqrt(3))\u22482, so k must be between 2 and 2 (since m=2). \n\nSo k=2. \n\nCheck if m=2 divides k(k-1)=2*1=2. Yes, 2 divides 2. \n\nThen a=(k\u00b2 -k)/m = (4 -2)/2 =1. \n\nThen c =k -a=2 -1=1. \n\nCheck if c is between 0 and m=2: yes, 1 is okay. \n\nThus, n =k\u00b2 =4. \n\nBut in base 3: 4 is 11 (since 1*3 +1=4). The sum of digits 1+1=2, which is sqrt(4)=2. \n\nSo that works. \n\nSo there is 1 b-eautiful number for b=3. \n\nProceeding to b=4 (m=3):\n\nPossible k between ceil(sqrt(3+1))=ceil(2)=2 and m=3. \n\nSo k=2,3. \n\nCheck each:\n\nk=2:\n\nCheck if 3 divides 2*1=2? 2 mod3\u22600. So no.\n\nk=3:\n\nCheck if 3 divides 3*2=6. Yes. \n\na=(9 -3)/3=6/3=2. \n\nc=3-2=1. \n\nCheck digits: a=2, c=1. In base4, 2*4 +1=9. sqrt(9)=3. 2+1=3. Correct. \n\nThus, n=9 is valid. \n\nThus, for b=4, one number. \n\nWait, but maybe k=2? Let me check again. \n\nWait, m=3, k=2. \n\nCheck if m divides k(k-1)=2*1=2. 3 divides 2? No. So invalid. \n\nThus, only k=3 gives a valid number. \n\nTotal is 1. \n\nWait, so b=4 also has one. \n\nProceeding to b=5, m=4.\n\nPossible k from ceil(sqrt(4+1))=ceil(2.236)=3 up to 4. \n\nSo k=3,4. \n\nCheck each:\n\nk=3:\n\nCheck if 4 divides 3*2=6. 6 mod4=2\u22600. Not divisible. \n\nk=4:\n\nCheck if 4 divides 4*3=12. Yes. \n\nCompute a=(16-4)/4=12/4=3. \n\nc=4-3=1. \n\nDigits in base5: 3*5 +1=16. sqrt(16)=4, digits sum 3+1=4. Correct. \n\nThus, n=16 is valid. \n\nThus, for b=5, one number. \n\nHmm, same as previous. \n\nProceeding to b=6 (m=5):\n\nk from ceil(sqrt(5+1))=ceil(2.449)=3 up to 5. \n\nk=3,4,5.\n\nCheck each:\n\nk=3:\n\nCheck 5 divides 3*2=6? 6 mod5=1\u22600.\n\nk=4:\n\nCheck 5 divides 4*3=12. 12 mod5=2\u22600.\n\nk=5:\n\nCheck 5 divides5*4=20.

Correct. \n\nThus, one number. \n\nStill one. \n\nb=7, m=6:\n\nk from ceil(sqrt(6+1))=ceil(2.645)=3 up to6. \n\nk=3,4,5,6. \n\nCheck each:\n\nk=3:\n\nCheck 6 divides 3*2=6? Yes. \n\nCompute a=(9-3)/6=6/6=1. \n\nc=3 -1=2. \n\nDigits:1*7 +2=9. sqrt(9)=3. Digits sum 1+2=3. Correct. \n\nThus, n=9 is valid. \n\nk=4:\n\nCheck 6 divides4*3=12. 12 mod6=0. \n\na=(16-4)/6=12/6=2. \n\nc=4-2=2. \n\nDigits:2*7 +2=16. sqrt(16)=4. Sum 2+2=4. Correct. \n\nThus, n=16 is valid. \n\nk=5:\n\nCheck 6 divides5*4=20. 20 mod6=2\u22600. \n\nk=6:\n\nCheck6 divides6*5=30. Yes. \n\na=(36-6)/6=30/6=5 \n\nc=6-5=1 \n\nDigits:5*7 +1=36. sqrt(36)=6. Sum 5+1=6. Correct. \n\nSo for k=3,4,6, we have valid numbers. \n\nThus, total 3 numbers for b=7. \n\nAh, okay, so here's an increase. \n\nContinuing:\n\nb=7 has 3 numbers. \n\nProceeding to b=8 (m=7):\n\nPossible k from ceil(sqrt(7+1))=ceil(2.828)=3 up to7. \n\nSo k=3,4,5,6,7. \n\nCheck each:\n\nk=3:\n\nCheck7 divides3*2=6. 6 mod7\u22600.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A b-eautiful number is a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of its digits equals the square root of that number. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A two-digit number in base b can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a can't be zero, so a must be between 1 and b-1, and c must be between 0 and b-1. The condition given is that a + c = sqrt(n). So, substituting n into the equation, we have a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). \n\nHmm, so the equation we need to satisfy is a + c = sqrt(a*b + c). Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root. That would give (a + c)^2 = a*b + c. Let me expand the left side: a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 = a*b + c. Then, rearranging terms, we can get all terms to one side: a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0. Let me see if I can simplify this equation.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let's think again. Since n = a*b + c, and a + c = sqrt(n), then substituting sqrt(n) into the equation gives (a + c)^2 = n = a*b + c. \n\nSo, (a + c)^2 = a*b + c. Let's rearrange this equation to solve for b? Maybe that's a good idea since we're looking for the base b. Let's see:\n\n(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0  \n=> a*b = (a + c)^2 - c  \n=> b = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a\n\nHmm, so for each possible a and c (with 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1), this equation must hold. But since b must be an integer, the right-hand side must be an integer. Therefore, for given a and c, we can compute b and check if it's an integer. \n\nBut since we need to find the minimal b where there are more than ten such numbers, perhaps we can approach this by first expressing the equation in terms of a and c, and then see for each possible a and c what b is required, and then count how many pairs (a,c) give the same b. \n\nAlternatively, since we need to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, maybe it's better to iterate over possible values of b starting from 2 upwards, compute how many pairs (a,c) satisfy the equation for each b, and stop when we find the first b where the count is more than 10. \n\nBut since this might take a while if done manually, perhaps we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nLet me think again. The equation is (a + c)^2 = a*b + c. Let me rearrange it to solve for b:\n\nb = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a. \n\nSo, for each a and c, this formula gives a possible b. So, for each a and c, we can compute b and see if that b is an integer, and also that a is less than b (since in base b, the first digit a must be less than b). \n\nTherefore, for each a and c where 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1, but actually since b is dependent on a and c, perhaps we can consider all possible a and c such that b is an integer and satisfies the constraints. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of a and c as variables, and for each pair (a,c), compute b as [(a + c)^2 - c]/a, and then note that for such a b, the number n = a*b + c is a two-digit number in base b. Therefore, the digits a and c must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1. \n\nSo, given that, for each pair (a,c), if the computed b is an integer, and a < b and c < b, then that pair contributes to the count for that b. \n\nTherefore, perhaps we can iterate over possible a and c, compute b, and tally how many times each b is generated by such pairs. Then, we can look for the smallest b where the tally exceeds 10. \n\nHmm, this seems manageable, but since I can't program here, maybe I can find some patterns.\n\nAlternatively, let's see if we can express the equation in another way. Let me denote s = a + c, so the equation becomes s^2 = a*b + c. But since s = a + c, we can write c = s - a. Substitute that into the equation:\n\ns^2 = a*b + (s - a)  \n=> s^2 = a*b + s - a  \n=> s^2 - s = a*b - a  \n=> s(s - 1) = a(b - 1)  \n\nHmm, that's an interesting equation. So s(s - 1) = a(b - 1). Since a and b are positive integers with a < b (since a is a digit in base b), and s = a + c, where c is between 0 and b-1, so s can be up to a + (b-1). \n\nBut given that s^2 = a*b + c, and since n = a*b + c must be a positive integer, so s must be at least 1. But since a and c are digits, the minimal s is 1 + 0 = 1, but s^2 must equal n, so n would be 1, which is 1 in base b, but that's a one-digit number. Therefore, the minimal s is probably 2, but let's see.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if the equation s(s - 1) = a(b - 1) can help. Since s and a are positive integers, and b must be an integer greater than a, we can think of s(s-1) must be divisible by a, and then b = (s(s -1)/a) + 1. Wait, let me see:\n\nFrom s(s - 1) = a(b - 1), solving for b:\n\nb = (s(s - 1)/a) + 1\n\nTherefore, for each s and a such that a divides s(s - 1), and then b is computed as above. Also, since c = s - a, and c must be between 0 and b - 1, we have constraints on c:\n\n0 \u2264 c = s - a \u2264 b - 1\n\nBut since b = (s(s-1)/a) + 1, substituting that into the upper bound for c:\n\ns - a \u2264 (s(s-1)/a) + 1 - 1 = s(s-1)/a\n\nSo,\n\ns - a \u2264 s(s-1)/a  \nMultiply both sides by a (assuming a positive, which it is):\n\na(s - a) \u2264 s(s - 1)\n\nExpand left side: a s - a\u00b2 \u2264 s\u00b2 - s\n\nBring all terms to the right:\n\n0 \u2264 s\u00b2 - s - a s + a\u00b2  \n=> 0 \u2264 s\u00b2 - (a + 1)s + a\u00b2\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Alternatively, perhaps proceed step by step with variables.\n\nAlternatively, since we need to count the number of (a,c) pairs for each b, let's fix b and find all a and c that satisfy the equation.\n\nGiven that n is a two-digit number in base b, so n = a*b + c where 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1. The condition is that a + c = sqrt(n). Therefore, (a + c)^2 = n = a*b + c.\n\nSo substituting n:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c  \n=> a^2 + 2ac + c^2 = a*b + c  \n=> a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c = a*b  \n=> b = (a^2 + 2ac + c^2 - c)/a  \n=> b = a + 2c + (c^2 - c)/a\n\nHmm, so for b to be integer, (c^2 - c) must be divisible by a. Since a divides (c^2 - c), which is c(c - 1).\n\nTherefore, a divides c(c - 1). Since a and c are digits in base b, with a between 1 and b-1 and c between 0 and b-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps to make progress, let me consider possible values of a and c.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me set variables as s = a + c, so s must equal sqrt(n). Since n = a*b + c, then n must be a perfect square. Therefore, n is a perfect square, and s = sqrt(n). \n\nTherefore, for each perfect square s\u00b2, we can see if there exists a base b such that when written as a two-digit number in base b, the digits a and c satisfy a + c = s, and n = a*b + c = s\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, for each s, we can set up equations:\n\na + c = s  \na*b + c = s\u00b2  \n\nFrom the first equation, c = s - a. Substitute into the second equation:\n\na*b + (s - a) = s\u00b2  \n=> a*b = s\u00b2 - s + a  \n=> b = (s\u00b2 - s + a)/a  \n=> b = (s\u00b2 - s)/a + 1  \n\nTherefore, for each s and a, such that a divides (s\u00b2 - s), then b is an integer given by the above formula. Additionally, since a is a digit in base b, we must have a < b. Also, since c = s - a must be a digit in base b, so 0 \u2264 c < b. Since c = s - a, then s - a must be between 0 and b -1. \n\nSo let's see the constraints:\n\n1. a must be a positive integer (since it's the first digit), so 1 \u2264 a \u2264 s - 1 (since c = s - a must be non-negative, so a \u2264 s). \n\n2. Additionally, since c = s - a must be less than b, but b is (s\u00b2 - s)/a + 1, so:\n\nc = s - a < b  \n=> s - a < (s\u00b2 - s)/a + 1  \nMultiply both sides by a (positive):\n\na(s - a) < s\u00b2 - s + a  \n=> a s - a\u00b2 < s\u00b2 - s + a  \nBring all terms to the right:\n\n0 < s\u00b2 - s + a - a s + a\u00b2  \n=> 0 < s\u00b2 - s(1 + a) + a + a\u00b2  \nHmm, maybe not helpful. Let's see if there are other constraints.\n\nAlternatively, since c must be non-negative, s - a \u2265 0 \u21d2 a \u2264 s.\n\nAlso, since a must divide (s\u00b2 - s), so a divides s(s - 1). \n\nSo for each s, possible a's are the divisors of s(s -1) that are between 1 and s. \n\nTherefore, for each s, the number of possible a's is the number of divisors of s(s-1) in [1, s]. Each such a gives a possible b via b = (s\u00b2 - s)/a + 1. \n\nBut for each such b, the digits a and c = s - a must satisfy the base constraints, i.e., a < b and c < b. \n\nWait, but since b = (s\u00b2 - s)/a + 1, then:\n\nFirst, a < b:\n\na < (s\u00b2 - s)/a + 1  \nMultiply both sides by a (since a >0):\n\na\u00b2 < s\u00b2 - s + a  \n=> a\u00b2 - a < s\u00b2 - s  \n=> a(a -1) < s(s -1)  \n\nWhich is true since a \u2264 s, so a(a -1) \u2264 s(s -1). So that inequality is okay, but equality occurs when a = s. But a can be up to s, but when a = s, then c = 0, so c < b?\n\nWait, let's check when a = s:\n\nIf a = s, then c = s - a = 0. So c =0 is allowed (since digits can be 0). Then b would be:\n\nb = (s\u00b2 - s)/s + 1 = (s -1) +1 = s. But then the base is b = s, but the first digit a = s must be less than b, which would be s < s, which is false. So a cannot be equal to s. Therefore, the maximum a can be s -1. \n\nTherefore, a must be in 1 \u2264 a \u2264 s -1. \n\nSo now, for each s, the possible a's are divisors of s(s-1) in 1 \u2264 a \u2264 s -1. \n\nEach such a gives a b value of (s\u00b2 - s)/a +1. \n\nFurthermore, for that b to be valid, we need c = s - a must be less than b. Let's see:\n\nc = s - a < b  \n=> s -a < (s\u00b2 - s)/a +1  \n=> (s - a) -1 < (s\u00b2 - s)/a  \nMultiply both sides by a (positive):\n\na(s - a -1) < s(s -1)  \nHmm, this seems complicated, perhaps better to check for specific cases. \n\nAlternatively, since b = (s(s -1)/a) +1, and since c = s -a, then c < b is equivalent to s -a < (s(s-1)/a) +1. Let me rearrange:\n\ns - a -1 < s(s -1)/a  \nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na(s - a -1) < s(s -1)  \nBut this is the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is automatically satisfied?\n\nLet me try plugging in some numbers. Let's take an example given in the problem: s = 9 (since sqrt(81)=9), and in base 13, n=81 is 63 in base 13. \n\nSo here, s =9, so s(s-1) = 9*8=72. The a in this case is 6. Since 6 divides 72, so that's okay.\n\nThen b = (81 -9)/6 +1 = (72)/6 +1 = 12 +1 =13, which matches. \n\nCheck the constraints: a=6 <13, c=3 <13, which is okay.\n\nAnother example: Let me think of s= 3. Let's see if there are numbers here. For s=3, s(s-1)=3*2=6. So possible a's are divisors of 6 in 1 \u2264a \u22642 (since s-1=2). The divisors are 1,2,3,6 but limited to 1 and 2. \n\nSo for a=1:\n\nb = (3\u00b2 -3)/1 +1 = (9 -3)/1 +1=6 +1=7. \n\nThen c =3 -1=2. Check that c=2 <7. So yes. The number n is 1*7 +2 =9, which is 3\u00b2, and 1+2=3, which is sqrt(9). So that works. \n\nSimilarly, a=2:\n\nb=(9-3)/2 +1 =6/2 +1=3+1=4.\n\nc=3 -2=1, which is less than 4. The number is 2*4 +1=9, which is 3\u00b2. 2+1=3=sqrt(9). That works.\n\nSo for s=3, there are two b's (7 and 4) but each gives a different b. Wait, but in this case, for each a, we get a different b, so each a corresponds to a different b. \n\nTherefore, for each s, the number of b's is equal to the number of a's (divisors of s(s-1) up to s-1). However, each such a and s gives a unique b. However, when we are counting the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b, we have to count all the (a,c) pairs that correspond to that b. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (s, a) such that b is given by [(s^2 -s)/a] +1, and the constraints on a and c are satisfied. \n\nTherefore, perhaps it's better to approach this problem by considering for each possible s, and for each a dividing s(s-1) up to s-1, the corresponding b is (s(s-1)/a) +1, and then for each such b, we can record the number of such pairs (a, c) that generate it. \n\nTherefore, the total count for each b is the number of (s, a) pairs that produce that b. \n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10. \n\nTherefore, perhaps I can compute this for various s and a and track the counts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find a way to parameterize the solutions. Let me see:\n\nGiven that b = (s(s -1)/a ) +1, \n\nthen s(s -1) = a(b -1). \n\nTherefore, for each b, the possible s must satisfy that s(s -1) is divisible by a, where a is a divisor of s(s -1) and a < b. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of s(s -1) as a multiple of a, so s(s -1) = k*a where k = b -1. Therefore, k must be an integer, so s(s-1) must be divisible by a, and k = s(s-1)/a. Then b = k +1. \n\nTherefore, for a given b, we can look for all possible s such that s(s -1) is divisible by some a (where a is between 1 and s-1), and the corresponding k = s(s-1)/a must equal b-1. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of pairs (s, a) where s(s -1) is divisible by a, a is between 1 and s -1, and s(s -1)/a = b -1. \n\nTherefore, equivalently, for each b, the number is the number of divisors a of s(s-1) for some s, such that s(s -1)/a = b -1 and a \u2264 s -1. \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I need to think of it as for each s, the number of a's that divide s(s-1) up to s-1, and then for each of those a's, the corresponding b is (s(s-1)/a) +1, so each such a contributes to the count for that b. \n\nTherefore, the total count for b is the number of (s,a) pairs such that b = (s(s-1)/a) +1 and a divides s(s-1) with a \u2264 s-1. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the way to proceed is to iterate over s starting from 2 upwards (since s=1 would give n=1, but that's a one-digit number), and for each s, find all a's that divide s(s-1) and are between 1 and s-1. For each such a, compute b = (s(s-1)/a) +1, and then increment the count for that b. Once we have counts for all b's up to some point, we can check when the count exceeds 10. \n\nAlternatively, since we need the minimal b, perhaps we can look for s and a such that b is as small as possible, but with enough pairs. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of variable substitution. Let me let t = s -1, so s = t +1. Then s(s -1) = (t+1)t = t(t+1). \n\nTherefore, the equation becomes b = [t(t+1)/a] +1. \n\nSo, for each t (starting from 1, since s starts from 2), and a divides t(t+1) with 1 \u2264 a \u2264 t. \n\nTherefore, for each t, the possible a's are the divisors of t(t+1) up to t. Then, for each such a, the corresponding b is (t(t+1)/a) +1. \n\nWe can then count how many times each b is generated by this process. \n\nThe minimal b would be when t(t+1)/a is minimized. Since a divides t(t+1), and a \u2264 t, so to minimize b, we need to maximize the denominator a. \n\nAlternatively, if we want to maximize the number of (a, t) pairs leading to the same b, perhaps we need to have b = (t(t+1)/a)+1 such that multiple (t,a) combinations can reach the same b. \n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each b, the number of pairs is the number of divisors a of t(t+1) such that a \u2264 t, and t(t+1)/a = b -1 for some t. \n\nThus, for each b, we can think of t(t+1) must be equal to a*(b -1). Since a divides t(t+1), then a can be any divisor of t(t+1) \u2264 t. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is the number of integers t where t(t+1) is divisible by (b -1), and there exists a divisor a of t(t+1) such that a = t(t+1)/(b -1) and a \u2264 t. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe it's better to try small s and see how the counts go, then look for a pattern or when the count exceeds 10.\n\nStarting with s=2:\n\ns=2:\n\ns(s-1)=2*1=2.\n\nPossible a's are divisors of 2 in [1,1] (since s-1=1). So a=1.\n\nThen b = (2*1)/1 +1=2 +1=3.\n\nSo, for s=2, a=1 gives b=3. The number n is 2^2=4. In base 3, 4 is 11 (1*3 +1). The digits sum to 1+1=2, which is sqrt(4). So that's valid. So this contributes 1 to b=3's count.\n\ns=3:\n\ns(s-1)=3*2=6.\n\nPossible a's are divisors of 6 in [1,2]. Divisors of 6 are 1,2,3,6. But limited to 1,2.\n\na=1:\n\nb = (6)/1 +1=7. \n\nCheck: a=1, c=3-1=2. n=1*7 +2=9=3^2. 1+2=3. Good. \n\na=2:\n\nb=(6)/2 +1=3+1=4.\n\nCheck: a=2, c=1. n=2*4 +1=9. 2+1=3. Correct. \n\nSo for s=3, two contributions: b=7 and b=4. So each gets +1.\n\ns=4:\n\ns(s-1)=4*3=12.\n\nPossible a's are divisors of 12 in [1,3]. Divisors are 1,2,3,4,6,12. Up to 3: 1,2,3.\n\na=1:\n\nb=(12)/1 +1=13. \n\nCheck: a=1, c=4-1=3. n=1*13 +3=16=4\u00b2. 1+3=4. Correct.\n\na=2:\n\nb=12/2 +1=6 +1=7.\n\nCheck: a=2, c=2. n=2*7 +2=16. 2+2=4. Correct.\n\na=3:\n\nb=12/3 +1=4 +1=5.\n\nCheck: a=3, c=1. n=3*5 +1=16. 3+1=4. Correct.\n\nThus, s=4 gives 3 contributions: b=13,7,5. Each gets +1.\n\nSo total counts so far:\n\nb=3:1 (from s=2)\n\nb=4:1 (from s=3 a=2) and +1 from s=4 a=3 \u2192 total 2?\n\nWait, no. Wait, s=3's a=2 gave b=4, so that's 1. Then s=4's a=3 gives b=5, so b=5 gets 1. Wait, s=4 a=3 gives b=5, so b=5 is new. Wait s=4's a=3 gives b=5, and s=3's a=2 gives b=4. \n\nWait, s=4's a=1 gives b=13, a=2 gives b=7, a=3 gives b=5. \n\nSo:\n\nAfter s=4:\n\nb=3:1\n\nb=4:1 (from s=3 a=2)\n\nb=5:1 (from s=4 a=3)\n\nb=7:2 (from s=3 a=1 and s=4 a=2?)\n\nWait no. Wait s=3 a=1 gives b=7. s=4 a=2 gives b=7 as well. Yes, because a=2 for s=4:\n\nb= (4*3)/2 +1 = 12/2 +1=6+1=7. \n\nAh, right. So s=4 with a=2 gives b=7. So b=7 would have two contributions: one from s=3 and one from s=4. So the counts:\n\nb=3:1\n\nb=4:1 (from s=3)\n\nb=5:1 (from s=4 a=3)\n\nb=7:2 (from s=3 a=1 and s=4 a=2)\n\nb=13:1 (from s=4 a=1)\n\nProceeding to s=5:\n\ns=5:\n\ns(s-1)=5*4=20.\n\nPossible a's are divisors of 20 in [1,4]. Divisors of 20:1,2,4,5,10,20. So up to 4: 1,2,4.\n\na=1:\n\nb=20/1 +1=21. \n\nCheck: a=1, c=4. n=1*21 +4=25=5\u00b2. 1+4=5. Correct.\n\na=2:\n\nb=20/2 +1=10 +1=11.\n\nCheck: a=2, c=3. n=2*11 +3=25. 2+3=5. Correct.\n\na=4:\n\nb=20/4 +1=5 +1=6.\n\nCheck: a=4, c=1. n=4*6 +1=25. 4+1=5. Correct.\n\nTherefore, s=5 contributes b=21, 11, 6. Each gets +1.\n\nNow updating counts:\n\nb=6:1 (from s=5 a=4)\n\nb=11:1 (from s=5 a=2)\n\nb=21:1 (from s=5 a=1)\n\nAlso, existing counts:\n\nb=7 now has 2, but with s=5, does any a lead to b=7? Let's see:\n\nLooking at a= (for s=5, if trying to get b=7):\n\nWe have b=(5*4)/a +1=20/a +1=7 \u21d2 20/a=6 \u21d2 a=20/6\u22483.333, which is not integer. So no. \n\nTherefore, s=5's contributions don't add to previous counts except for new b's. \n\nContinuing:\n\ns=6:\n\ns(s-1)=6*5=30.\n\nPossible a's: divisors of 30 up to 5. Divisors of 30:1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30. So up to 5: 1,2,3,5.\n\na=1:\n\nb=30/1 +1=31. \n\nCheck: a=1, c=5. n=1*31 +5=36=6\u00b2. 1+5=6.

Correct.\n\nWait, a=5 is allowed since a \u2264 s-1=5. \n\nThus, s=6's contributions:\n\nb=31,16,11,7. \n\nTherefore, updating counts:\n\nb=7 now has previous 2 (from s=3 and s=4) plus this a=5 from s=6 \u2192 total 3.\n\nb=11 had 1 (from s=5), now +1 from s=6 a=3 \u2192 total 2.\n\nb=16:1 (from s=6 a=2)\n\nb=31:1 (from s=6 a=1)\n\nContinuing:\n\ns=7:\n\ns(s-1)=7*6=42.\n\nPossible a's: divisors of 42 up to 6.

Then s=21 a=14 gives b=31, so no. \n\nWait, when s=26 a=25 gives b=27, so adding to the existing count. \n\nPreviously, for b=27, prior to s=26:\n\nLooking back:\n\nAt s=13 a=6 contributed to b=27. \n\ns=21 a=14 (which was part of s=21's contributions) contributed to b=31 (no). \n\nWait, s=26's contribution: a=25 gives b=27. \n\nWait, earlier counts for b=27 were:\n\nLooking back to when s=13:\n\nWhen s=13, a=6 contributed to b=27. \n\nThen, s=21 a=6 (a=6 for s=21 gives b=71, not 27). \n\nWait the count for b=27 was initially 1 (from s=13 a=6), then in s=26 a=25 adds another. So now total 2?\n\nWait, let me check when s=26 is processed:\n\ns=26 a=25 gives b=27. Before s=26, the count for b=27 was:\n\nLooking back to s=13: yes, 1. \n\ns=15's a=7 gave b=31, so no. \n\nSo before s=26, b=27 had 1. After s=26, it's 2.\n\nWait, but in the previous steps (before s=26), when was b=27 counted?\n\nWait, let me look back at the earlier steps:\n\nAfter s=13:\n\nb=27 was 1 (from s=13 a=6).\n\nAfter s=21:\n\ns=21 a=14 gives b=31. \n\nThus, before s=26, b=27 had 1. Adding s=26's contribution gives b=27 a total of 2. \n\nThus, the updated counts for this step (s=26):\n\nb=27:2 (from s=13 a=6 and s=26 a=25)\n\nb=51:2 (from s=25 a=12 and s=26 a=13)\n\nOther contributions:\n\nb=26:1 (from s=25 a=24)\n\nb=31 had 6 (from s=5,10,15,16,21,25?), wait need to track. \n\nActually, s=25 a=20 contributes to b=31 (since 600/20=30 +1=31). \n\nWait yes, so s=25 a=20 gives b=31, so adding to previous counts:\n\nOriginally, s=5 a=1 gives b=31 (wait no, s=5 a=1 gives b=31? Wait s=5 a=1: s=5 is 5, so s(s-1)=20. So b=(20)/1 +1=21, not 31. Wait my mistake.\n\nWait s=5:\n\nWait when s=5, a=1 gives b=21? Wait no, let me check earlier steps:\n\nWait for s=5:\n\na=1 gives b=20/1 +1=21? Wait no, s=5's s(s-1)=5\u00d74=20. \n\nSo, b=(20)/1 +1=21. So s=5 a=1 gives b=21. \n\nWait, s=5 a=2 gives b=10 +1=11.\n\nWait, so my mistake earlier: the previous counts for b=31 were from s=15 a=7 (s=15, a=7 gives 210/7 +1=30+1=31). \n\nThus, b=31 is from s=15 a=7, s=21 a=14, and s=25 a=20. \n\nWait s=25 a=20 gives b=31 (since 600/20 +1=30+1=31), so that's correct. \n\nThus, before s=26, b=31 had 6 contributions? Wait let's track:\n\nLooking back:\n\nAt s=5, a=1 gives b=21. \n\ns=10 a=3 gives b=31 (from s=10, a=3: 90/3 +1=30+1=31).\n\ns=15 a=7 gives b=31 (210/7 +1=30+1=31).\n\ns=21 a=14 gives b=31 (420/14 +1=30+1=31).\n\ns=25 a=20 gives b=31 (600/20 +1=30+1=31).\n\nWait that's 5 contributions. \n\nWait s=5 a=1 gives b=21, not 31. \n\nWait s=10 a=3 gives b=31? Let me check s=10:\n\ns=10 a=3: 90/3 +1=30+1=31. Yes. \n\nTherefore, total contributions to b=31 are:\n\ns=10 a=3,\n\ns=15 a=7,\n\ns=21 a=14,\n\ns=25 a=20,\n\nand also s=26 a=... no, s=26's contributions are 651, etc. \n\nWait, so total of 4 contributions before s=26? \n\nWait s=5 a=1 gives b=21. \n\nWait, so maybe my counting was off, but the key point is that after s=25, b=31 had 4, and s=25 a=20 gives another, totaling 5? Wait no, s=25 a=20 is one of them. \n\nWait let's track step by step:\n\nWhen s=10: a=3 contributes to b=31 (count=1)\n\ns=15 a=7: count=2\n\ns=21 a=14: count=3\n\ns=25 a=20: count=4\n\nWait, so s=25 a=20 gives the 4th contribution. \n\nThen s=26 does not contribute to b=31. \n\nThus, s=26's contributions are:\n\nb=27 (2), 51 (2), 66, 131, 326, 651.\n\nContinuing to s=27:\n\nBut since we are looking for the first b where the count exceeds 10, perhaps I should start checking the current counts for each b up to a certain point. \n\nLet me pause and see where we are. \n\nLooking at the counts after s=25:\n\nLooking for the counts of each b:\n\nLooking for the highest counts so far. Let's check some key b's:\n\nb=27: After s=26 (s=26 a=25) it has 2 contributions.\n\nWait let me make a table of counts for some b's that might be accumulating:\n\nLooking at b=31:\n\nContributions come from s=10 a=3 (b=31), s=15 a=7 (b=31), s=21 a=14 (b=31), s=25 a=20 (b=31).
