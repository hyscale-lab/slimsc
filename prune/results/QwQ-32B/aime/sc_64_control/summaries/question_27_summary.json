      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the difference between the radii of the circles along which the torus T is tangent to the sphere S when it's inside and outside. The problem states that the torus has a radius of 3, and the sphere has a radius of 11. The axis of revolution for the torus is 6 units away from the center of the generating circle, so the torus is a donut shape with a tube radius of 3 and a major radius of 6. \n\nFirst, I need to visualize the problem. When the torus rests on the inside of the sphere, it's internally tangent. That means the sphere is larger, and the torus is inside it, touching along a circle. Similarly, when it's on the outside, the torus is outside the sphere and externally tangent. The radii of these circles of tangency are r_i and r_o respectively, and I need to find r_i - r_o as a fraction m/n, then m + n.\n\nHmm, maybe I should start by recalling the equations of a torus and a sphere in coordinates. Let me set up a coordinate system. Let's assume that the sphere S is centered at the origin (0,0,0). \n\nFor the torus T, when it's revolved around an axis in its plane, which is the x-axis, maybe? Let me think. The standard parametrization of a torus is given by rotating a circle in the y-z plane around the x-axis. Wait, actually, the axis of revolution is in the plane of the circle. So if the original circle is in, say, the x-y plane, then the axis of revolution is also in the x-y plane, at a distance of 6 from the center of the circle. Let me make this precise.\n\nLet me suppose the generating circle of the torus is in the x-y plane, with its center at (6, 0, 0). The circle has radius 3, so any point on the generating circle can be written as (6 + 3 cos \u03b8, 3 sin \u03b8, 0) where \u03b8 is the angle parameter. Then when we revolve this around the x-axis (since the axis of revolution is in the plane of the circle, which is the x-axis here, if the circle is in x-y plane and the axis is the x-axis), the torus is formed by rotating these points around the x-axis. The parametrization would involve adding a second angle \u03c6 for the revolution around the x-axis. So the coordinates would be:\n\nx = 6 + 3 cos \u03b8,\n\ny = (3 sin \u03b8) cos \u03c6,\n\nz = (3 sin \u03b8) sin \u03c6,\n\nwhere \u03b8 and \u03c6 are angles from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to consider coordinates where the sphere is centered at the origin, so when the torus is inside the sphere, the center of the generating circle (which is at (6,0,0)) must be positioned such that the entire torus is inside the sphere. Wait, but how exactly is the torus oriented?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to think geometrically. Let me consider cross-sections. The sphere of radius 11 has center at the origin. The torus is inside the sphere, so the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle of the torus must be such that when you add the major radius (distance from center to the axis) and the minor radius (radius of the generating circle), it doesn't exceed the sphere's radius. Wait, actually, when it's resting on the inside, maybe the center of the generating circle is at some point inside the sphere, and the distance from the origin to the center of the torus's generating circle plus the major radius? Hmm, perhaps I need to model the positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the method of finding the points where the torus and sphere are tangent. Since they are tangent along a circle, the equations of the two surfaces must have a common circle of solutions, and the gradients must be colinear there, etc. This might get complicated, but maybe manageable.\n\nLet me try to set up coordinates. Let's suppose that the sphere is centered at the origin. Let's also choose coordinates so that the axis of the torus is the x-axis. Then the center of the generating circle of the torus is at (d, 0, 0), where d is the distance from the origin? Wait, but the original problem says the axis is in the plane of the circle and is 6 units from the center. Wait, the axis is the line around which the circle is revolved. The circle is in a plane (say, the x-y plane), and the axis is a line in that plane (so also in x-y plane), at a distance of 6 from the center of the circle. So for instance, if the generating circle has its center at (6,0,0), then the axis of revolution is the y-axis? Wait, no. Wait, the axis must be in the plane of the circle, so let me clarify.\n\nLet me suppose that the generating circle is in the x-y plane, with its center at (6,0,0). Then the axis of revolution is the y-axis? Wait, no. Wait, the axis of revolution must be in the same plane as the generating circle. To get a torus, the axis of revolution is a line in the plane of the circle, at a distance equal to the major radius from the center of the generating circle. So if the generating circle is at (6,0,0) and the axis is the y-axis? Wait, if the axis is along the y-axis, then the distance from the center (6,0,0) to the y-axis is 6 units, which matches the given. So that would be correct. Therefore, the axis of revolution is the y-axis. Wait, but then when you rotate the generating circle around the y-axis, the torus would be a surface where each point is at a distance from the y-axis varying between 3 and 9? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the axis of revolution is the z-axis? Wait, no. The problem says the axis is in the plane of the circle, so if the generating circle is in x-y plane, the axis is also in x-y plane. Let's say the generating circle's center is at (6,0,0) and the axis is the y-axis. Then when you rotate the circle around the y-axis, the distance from the axis (y-axis) to the center of the generating circle is 6 units, so the major radius is 6, and the minor radius is 3. The resulting torus would have points where the distance from the y-axis is between 3 and 9, so the torus is around the y-axis. Hmm, okay, but how does this interact with the sphere?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should choose coordinates so that the axis of the torus is along the x-axis, so that the generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to the x-axis, but the problem says the axis is in the plane of the circle, so that can't be. Wait, maybe I need to get this straight.\n\nLet me try to re-define the coordinate system step by step.\n\nLet me suppose the generating circle is in the x-y plane, with center at (a, 0, 0), where the axis of revolution is the y-axis. Then the distance from the center (a,0,0) to the y-axis is |a|. Since the problem states that the axis is 6 units from the center, then a = 6. Therefore, the generating circle has center at (6,0,0) and radius 3, and is revolved around the y-axis. That forms a torus whose major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the axis) is 6, and minor radius (radius of the tube) is 3. The axis of the torus is the y-axis.\n\nNow, the sphere S is centered at the origin with radius 11. When the torus is resting on the inside of S, it must be placed such that it is entirely inside the sphere and tangent along some circle. Similarly, when resting on the outside, it's outside the sphere and tangent. To find the radii of the circles of tangency, r_i and r_o.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when the torus is inside the sphere. The sphere's equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 11\u00b2 = 121.\n\nThe equation of the torus can be written in terms of coordinates. Since the torus is formed by rotating the generating circle around the y-axis (the axis of revolution), the standard equation for a torus revolved around the y-axis would be:\n\n[(sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R)\u00b2 + y\u00b2] = r\u00b2,\n\nwhere R is the major radius (distance from the axis to the center of the generating circle), and r is the minor radius (radius of the generating circle). \n\nWait, let me check. Let me recall the general equation of a torus. If the axis is the y-axis, then the distance from any point (x,y,z) to the y-axis is sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). The generating circle is centered at (6, 0, 0) with radius 3. So points on the generating circle satisfy (x - 6)^2 + z^2 = 3^2, and y =0. When rotating around the y-axis, the x and z coordinates will form circles in planes perpendicular to the y-axis. So the equation of the torus should be:\n\nsqrt( (sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - 6)^2 + y^2 ) = 3?\n\nWait, no, perhaps better to think in terms of the standard equation. Let me recall that for a torus rotated around the y-axis with major radius R and minor radius r, the equation is:\n\n( sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R )\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2.\n\nYes, that's right. So in our case, R is 6 (distance from the axis y-axis to the center (6,0,0)), and minor radius r is 3. So the equation is:\n\n( sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - 6 )\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 9.\n\nOkay, that's the equation of the torus.\n\nNow, when the torus is inside the sphere, which is centered at the origin with radius 11, the two surfaces will be tangent along a circle. To find the radius of this circle, we need to find the set of points that are on both the torus and the sphere, and where their normals are colinear (i.e., the surfaces are tangent there). The circle of tangency will lie in a plane where both surfaces are tangent, so the points on both surfaces must satisfy both equations, and the gradients must be parallel.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a simpler way. Since the surfaces are tangent along a circle, the circle must lie in a plane that is at a certain distance from the origin. Let me think in terms of cross-sections. Let's consider the sphere and the torus. Let me try to find the locus of points common to both.\n\nThe sphere equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nThe torus equation: (sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - 6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 9.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) as r_xy. Wait, actually, since y is involved as well, let me see:\n\nLet me let\u2019s set up variables. Let me consider that in the torus equation, we can write:\n\n( sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - 6 )\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 9.\n\nLet me expand this equation:\n\n( sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - 6 )\u00b2 = 9 - y\u00b2,\n\ntake square roots? Hmm, maybe better to substitute the sphere equation into this. Let me see if I can combine the two equations.\n\nLet me denote s = sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Then the torus equation becomes (s - 6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 9.\n\nThe sphere equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121, which can be written as s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121.\n\nSo substituting s\u00b2 = 121 - y\u00b2 into the torus equation?\n\nWait, perhaps we can solve these equations together.\n\nFrom the sphere equation: s\u00b2 = 121 - y\u00b2.\n\nFrom the torus equation: (s - 6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 9.\n\nLet me substitute s\u00b2 from the sphere into the torus equation. Wait, maybe expand the torus equation:\n\n(s - 6)^2 + y\u00b2 = s\u00b2 - 12s + 36 + y\u00b2 = 9.\n\nBut from the sphere equation, s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121, so s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121. Let me substitute s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 with 121 in the expanded torus equation:\n\n(s\u00b2 - 12s + 36) + y\u00b2 = (s\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -12s +36 = 121 -12s + 36 = 9.\n\nThus,\n\n121 - 12s + 36 = 9,\n\nso 157 - 12s = 9,\n\nthen -12s = 9 -157 = -148,\n\nso 12s = 148,\n\ns = 148 / 12 = 37 / 3 \u2248 12.333...\n\nWait, but this is s = sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). But s is supposed to be sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2), which must be a real number. Let me check my steps again.\n\nWait, expanding the torus equation:\n\n( s - 6 )\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 9,\n\nso s\u00b2 -12s +36 + y\u00b2 = 9,\n\nthen s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -12s +36 =9,\n\nbut s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 from the sphere is 121,\n\nso substituting,\n\n121 -12s +36 =9,\n\nso 121 +36 = 157; 157 -12s =9,\n\nso indeed, 12s =157 -9=148,\n\ns=148/12=37/3\u224812.333...\n\nHmm, that seems okay, but sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2)=37/3. Then from the sphere equation, x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (37/3)^2, so y\u00b2 =121 - (37/3)^2.\n\nWait, but then the points of intersection must lie on both surfaces, so they must satisfy both equations. Wait, but if s =37/3, then from the sphere equation, y\u00b2 =121 - (37/3)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n121 is 121/1, (37/3)^2 = 1369/9,\n\nso y\u00b2 = (121*9 -1369)/9 = (1089 -1369)/9 = (-280)/9.\n\nWait, that's impossible. Negative y\u00b2? That can't be. So that suggests that there is no real solution? That can't be right because the problem states that they are tangent along a circle. So I must have made an error in my equations or setup.\n\nHmm, let me check the equations again. Let's go back step by step.\n\nFirst, the torus equation: when revolved around the y-axis, with major radius 6 (distance from the axis (y-axis) to the center of the generating circle (6,0,0)), and minor radius 3. So the equation should be:\n\nsqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) is the distance from the point to the y-axis, so the equation is (sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + y^2 = 3^2 =9.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSphere equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121.\n\nSo, substituting the sphere equation into the torus equation's expansion.\n\nWait, let me try again. Let me denote s = sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Then the sphere equation gives s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =121.\n\nThe torus equation is (s -6)^2 + y^2 =9.\n\nSubtract the two equations:\n\n[(s -6)^2 + y^2] - [s\u00b2 + y\u00b2] =9 -121,\n\nExpand the left side:\n\n(s\u00b2 -12s +36 + y\u00b2) - (s\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = -12s +36 = -112,\n\nThus, -12s +36 = -112,\n\n-12s = -148,\n\ns = 148/12 = 37/3 \u224812.333...\n\nThen, substituting back into the sphere equation: s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =121,\n\nso y\u00b2 =121 - (37/3)^2,\n\nCompute 37 squared: 37*37 = 1369,\n\nThus,\n\ny\u00b2 =121 - (1369/9) = (1089 -1369)/9 = (-280)/9,\n\nWhich is negative, so that can't be. Hmm, so that suggests that there is no real solution? But the problem says that when the torus is inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. So perhaps I have an error in the setup.\n\nWait a second. Maybe the torus isn't centered at (6,0,0) with the axis at the origin? Wait, no. Wait, if the sphere is centered at the origin, then the torus must be positioned such that it's inside the sphere, so perhaps the center of the torus's generating circle isn't at (6,0,0), but somewhere else?\n\nWait, perhaps I messed up the coordinate system. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says: \"the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle\".\n\nSo, the torus is generated by taking a circle of radius 3 in, say, the x-y plane, with its center at (6,0,0), and revolving it around the y-axis, which is 6 units away from the center. The resulting torus has major radius 6, minor radius 3.\n\nNow, when we place this torus inside the sphere of radius 11, centered at the origin, perhaps the center of the generating circle (the point (6,0,0)) is not at (6,0,0) but somewhere else? Because otherwise, as we saw, the equations don't yield real solutions. Wait, but the problem states that the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, so maybe the entire torus must be inside the sphere, so the center of the generating circle must be closer to the origin?\n\nWait, perhaps the axis of the torus is not aligned with the coordinate axes as I assumed. Maybe to make the torus tangent to the sphere, the center of the generating circle must be positioned such that the closest point on the torus to the origin is tangent to the sphere?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem requires that the torus is placed such that its center is along the line connecting the centers of the sphere and the torus. Since the sphere is at the origin, maybe the torus's generating circle's center is along the same axis as the sphere's center. Wait, perhaps the axis of the torus is aligned along the line connecting the origin to the center of the torus?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reorient the coordinate system so that the axis of the torus passes through the origin? Let me try that.\n\nSuppose the sphere is centered at the origin. Let me define the torus such that its axis of revolution passes through the origin. Let me set the axis of the torus along the x-axis. Then the generating circle is in a plane perpendicular to the x-axis, say at position (d, 0, 0), so the center of the generating circle is at (d, 0, 0), and the axis is the x-axis. The distance from the center to the axis is |d|, so according to the problem, this distance must be 6. So d =6. Thus, the generating circle has center at (6,0,0) and radius 3, and is revolved around the x-axis. Then the equation of the torus would be:\n\nsqrt( (y^2 + z^2) ) is the radius from the axis (x-axis) to the point, so the equation is:\n\n(sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + x\u00b2 = 3\u00b2.\n\nWait, that's different from before. Let me verify.\n\nYes, if the axis is the x-axis, then the distance from any point (x,y,z) to the x-axis is sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). The generating circle is at x=6, so when you rotate around the x-axis, the equation becomes (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - 6)^2 + (x -6)^2 = 3\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, the generating circle is in a plane perpendicular to the x-axis, centered at (6,0,0), so points on the generating circle satisfy (x -6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 3\u00b2, z=0. When revolved around the x-axis, the y and z coordinates form a circle, so the equation becomes (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) )^2 + (x -6)^2 = 3\u00b2? Wait, no, that would be the equation for the generating circle before revolution. Wait, actually, the standard equation for a torus with major radius R (distance from the center of the tube to the axis), minor radius r, and axis along the x-axis is:\n\n(sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R)^2 + x\u00b2 = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, let me think again. Let me recall that if the axis is along the x-axis, then the distance from a point (x,y,z) to the x-axis is sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). The center of the generating circle is at (R,0,0), so when you move along the x-axis by R, the distance from the axis is R. The generating circle has radius r, so the equation of the torus is (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R)^2 + (x)^2 = r\u00b2? Wait, no, perhaps (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R)^2 + (x - center_x)^2 = r\u00b2? Wait, maybe my confusion arises here.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of parametric equations. Let me parameterize the torus. Suppose the axis is the x-axis, and the generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to the x-axis at x = 6, with center at (6,0,0) and radius 3. So any point on the generating circle can be written as (6, 3 cos \u03b8, 3 sin \u03b8). When we rotate this around the x-axis, each point (x,y,z) becomes (6, 3 cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6, 3 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6, 3 sin \u03b8)? Wait, no, rotating around the x-axis, the y and z coordinates rotate in the y-z plane. Wait, the parameterization would be:\n\nx =6,\n\ny = 3 cos \u03b8,\n\nz = 3 sin \u03b8,\n\nbut then rotating around the x-axis, so actually, we need to rotate the generating circle (which is in the plane x=6, y-z plane) around the x-axis. Wait, actually, if the generating circle is in the plane x=6, then rotating around the x-axis would sweep it into the torus. The coordinates would be:\n\nx =6 + 0 (since rotating around x-axis doesn't affect x),\n\ny = 3 cos \u03b8 * cos \u03c6,\n\nz = 3 cos \u03b8 * sin \u03c6,\n\nWait, no, perhaps better:\n\nWait, parametrization of a torus when rotating a circle in the plane perpendicular to the x-axis (the generating circle is in x=6 plane):\n\nLet me think again. Let me use parameters \u03b8 and \u03c6 where \u03b8 is the angle around the generating circle, and \u03c6 is the angle around the axis (x-axis). The generating circle has center at (6,0,0) and radius 3. So a point on the generating circle is (6, 3 cos \u03b8, 3 sin \u03b8). Then, rotating this point around the x-axis would involve rotating the y and z coordinates around the x-axis. Since the x-axis rotation is parameterized by \u03c6, but actually, rotating the point (6, 3 cos \u03b8, 3 sin \u03b8) around the x-axis by angle \u03c6 would give:\n\ny = (3 cos \u03b8) cos \u03c6 - (3 sin \u03b8) sin \u03c6,\n\nz = (3 cos \u03b8) sin \u03c6 + (3 sin \u03b8) cos \u03c6,\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the standard parametrization of a torus with major radius R and minor radius r around the x-axis:\n\nx = R + r cos \u03b8,\n\ny = (r sin \u03b8) cos \u03c6,\n\nz = (r sin \u03b8) sin \u03c6,\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle parameterizing the generating circle, and \u03c6 is the angle around the axis. Wait, but in this case, the center of the generating circle is at (R, 0, 0). So yes, this is the standard parametrization. So with R =6 (distance from the axis at x=0 to the center?), Wait, no, hold on. Wait, if the axis is the x-axis, then the center of the generating circle is at (R, 0,0), so the distance from the axis (x-axis) is indeed R. Thus, in this case, with R=6 and r=3, the equation of the torus can be written as:\n\nsqrt( (y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) ) = distance from (x,y,z) to the x-axis. Wait, but the equation of the torus is derived from the parametrization. Let me think algebraically.\n\nThe standard equation for a torus around the x-axis with major radius R and minor radius r is:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R )\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, no, that can't be. Let me see. Let me consider a point on the torus. The distance from the x-axis is sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). The generating circle is at x = R, so when we rotate around the x-axis, the x-coordinate varies, but actually, no, the x-coordinate is fixed at R for the generating circle. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine this.\n\nWait, in the standard parametrization, if the torus is around the x-axis, then the center of the generating circle is at (R,0,0). The generating circle has points with coordinates (R + r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8, 0). Then rotating around the x-axis, the y and z coordinates become (r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6, r sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, r cos \u03b8). Wait, maybe different parameterization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is:\n\n( sqrt( (y)^2 + (z)^2 ) - R )^2 + (x)^2 = r^2 ?\n\nWait, let me plug in the parametrization.\n\nLet me use the standard parametrization where:\n\nx = R + r cos \u03b8,\n\ny = r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6,\n\nz = r sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6,\n\nWait, this would be a torus around the x-axis? Let me see: the angle \u03b8 is around the generating circle, and \u03c6 is the rotation around the x-axis.\n\nWait, in that case, the center of the generating circle is at (R,0,0), so the distance from the axis (x-axis) is R, and the minor radius is r. So the equation would be:\n\nsqrt( (y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) ) is the distance from the x-axis, which for the torus should be between R - r and R + r. The equation would be (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R)^2 + (x)^2 = r^2.\n\nWait, testing with the parametrization:\n\nTake x = R + r cos \u03b8,\n\nthen, the term (x)^2 = (R + r cos \u03b8)^2,\n\nsqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt( (r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6)^2 + (r sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)^2 ) = r sin \u03b8,\n\nso (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R)^2 + x^2 = (r sin \u03b8 - R)^2 + (R + r cos \u03b8)^2.\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to simplify to r^2. Let me compute:\n\nExpand (r sin \u03b8 - R)^2 + (R + r cos \u03b8)^2,\n\n= r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 - 2 R r sin \u03b8 + R\u00b2 + R\u00b2 + 2 R r cos \u03b8 + r\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8,\n\n= R\u00b2 + R\u00b2 + r\u00b2 (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + (-2 R r sin \u03b8 + 2 R r cos \u03b8),\n\n= 2 R\u00b2 + r\u00b2 + 2 R r (cos \u03b8 - sin \u03b8).\n\nHmm, that's not equal to r\u00b2. So maybe my equation is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation should be (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R)^2 + x\u00b2 = r\u00b2?\n\nWait, but in the parametrization above, when \u03b8=0, then the point is (R + r, 0, 0). So plugging into the equation:\n\nsqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) =0, so (0 - R)^2 + (R + r)^2 = R\u00b2 + (R + r)^2. Which should equal r\u00b2? No. That's not right.\n\nHmm, maybe the parametrization is different. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, if the parametrization is:\n\nx = (R + r cos \u03b8) cos \u03c6,\n\ny = (R + r cos \u03b8) sin \u03c6,\n\nz = r sin \u03b8,\n\nThen this is a torus around the z-axis. Wait, perhaps confusion arises from different axes.\n\nLet me instead consider that the standard equation for a torus with axis along the x-axis, major radius R, minor radius r is:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R )\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me check with a point on the generating circle. If we are at \u03b8=0 on the generating circle, which is at x=R, y=0, z=0. Then plugging into the equation: (sqrt(0 +0) - R)^2 + R\u00b2 = ( - R )\u00b2 + R\u00b2 = 2 R\u00b2. Which should equal r\u00b2? No, that's not correct. So clearly, that equation is wrong.\n\nHmm, perhaps the equation is ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R )\u00b2 + (x)^2 = r\u00b2? Wait, no. Maybe I need to flip it.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct equation is:\n\n( sqrt( (x - R)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 ) - r )\u00b2 = R\u00b2 ?\n\nNo, perhaps I need to approach this differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation of the torus is better expressed in terms of the parametrization. Let me consider the parametrization where the torus is generated by rotating the circle (in the y-z plane) centered at (R, 0, 0) with radius r around the x-axis. Wait, no, in 3D, rotating around the x-axis would sweep the circle in the y-z plane around the x-axis. Wait, the generating circle is in a plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution. So if the axis is the x-axis, then the generating circle is in the y-z plane at some x-coordinate, say x = R. The parametrization would be:\n\nx = R,\n\ny = r cos \u03b8,\n\nz = r sin \u03b8,\n\nthen rotating this around the x-axis would involve rotating the y and z coordinates around the x-axis. Wait, but rotating around the x-axis would mean that the y and z coordinates form circles in planes perpendicular to the x-axis. Wait, actually, rotating the point (R, r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8) around the x-axis would give:\n\nx remains R,\n\ny becomes r cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6,\n\nz becomes r cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6,\n\nWait, but then the coordinates would be (R, r cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6, r cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6). But this seems to have a dependency on \u03b8 and \u03c6, but perhaps this is not the standard parametrization. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use \u03b8 as the angle around the generating circle and \u03c6 as the angle around the axis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation is:\n\n( sqrt( (y^2 + z^2 ) ) - r )^2 + (x - R)^2 = R^2 ?\n\nNo, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should just look up the equation of a torus. Wait, since I can't actually look it up, let me think again.\n\nThe standard torus with major radius R and minor radius r, centered at the origin, and rotating around the z-axis, has equation (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - R)^2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2.\n\nSo if we want the axis of rotation to be the x-axis, we can swap variables accordingly. So, for a torus around the x-axis, it would be (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R)^2 + x\u00b2 = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me check with R=6 and r=3. Then, at the point (x, y, z) = (6, 0, 0): sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)=0, so (0 -6)^2 +6\u00b2 = 36 +36 =72. Which should equal r\u00b2=9? No, that's not correct. So clearly, my equation is wrong.\n\nHmm, maybe the equation is (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R)^2 + (x)^2 = r\u00b2. Wait, if R is the distance from the axis to the center of the tube, which is 6, then the center of the tube is at (R,0,0). Wait, but then the distance from the center to the axis is R, so the equation should be such that when x=0, the distance from the axis is R \u00b1 r? Maybe.\n\nWait, let's consider a point on the \"outer\" part of the torus along the x-axis. The center of the generating circle is at (R,0,0). The generating circle has radius r, so the farthest point along the x-axis would be (R + r, 0, 0). Similarly, the closest point would be (R - r, 0, 0). So for example, if R =6, r=3, then the outermost point is at (9,0,0), and innermost at (3,0,0).\n\nThus, the equation of the torus should allow x to go from R - r to R + r. Let me think of cross sections. For a fixed x, the cross-section in y-z plane should be a circle of radius r', where r' = sqrt( (distance from (x,0,0) to center)^2 - (x - R)^2 )? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, consider that for any point on the torus, its distance from the center of the generating circle (R,0,0) must be r. But the center moves along the axis as we rotate. Wait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the parametrization approach. Let me define \u03b8 as the angle parameterizing the generating circle, and \u03c6 as the angle around the axis.\n\nLet me set up the torus with major radius R=6, minor radius r=3, and axis along the x-axis. The parametrization would then be:\n\nx = R + r cos \u03b8,\n\ny = r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6,\n\nz = r sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6,\n\nwhere \u03b8 and \u03c6 are from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nThus, the coordinates are:\n\nx = 6 + 3 cos \u03b8,\n\ny = 3 sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6,\n\nz = 3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6.\n\nThen, to find the equation of the torus, let's express this in terms of x,y,z.\n\nLet me write:\n\nLet\u2019s denote A = x - 6 = 3 cos \u03b8,\n\nand B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = (3 sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6)^2 + (3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6)^2 = 9 sin\u00b2\u03b8 (cos\u00b2\u03c6 + sin\u00b2\u03c6) =9 sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nso B\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =9 sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nthen,\n\n(A)^2 =9 cos\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nand (B\u00b2 + C\u00b2) =9 sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nso (A)^2 + (B\u00b2 + C\u00b2) =9 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8)=9,\n\nThus,\n\n(x -6)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =9.\n\nWait, that simplifies to (x -6)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 9. But that's the equation of a sphere of radius 3 centered at (6,0,0). That can't be right, since we were trying to get a torus equation. Clearly, something is wrong here. Wait, no, that parametrization does not form a torus, but actually a sphere? That can't be.\n\nWait, hold on. If we parameterize with \u03b8 and \u03c6 as above, then each \u03b8 gives a circle in the y-z plane offset by x =6 + 3 cos \u03b8. So when \u03b8 varies, the x-coordinate varies, and the y-z coordinates form circles of radius 3 sin \u03b8. Wait, but when \u03b8=0, we have x=9, and y=z=0. When \u03b8=\u03c0, x=3, and y=z=0. For other angles, the x-coordinate is between 3 and 9, and the y-z coordinates form circles with radius 3 sin \u03b8. Hmm, so actually, this is a spindle torus? Wait, no, no, when R > r, it's a standard torus. Wait, R is 6, r is 3, so it should be a standard torus. But according to the equation derived above, (x -6)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 9, which is a sphere of radius 3 centered at (6,0,0). But that's not a torus. Clearly, my parametrization is wrong. \n\nWait, what's the mistake here? Let me check the parametrization again. If the generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to the x-axis at x=6, then parametrizing the generating circle as (6, 3 cos \u03b8, 3 sin \u03b8), and then rotating around the x-axis, the rotation would involve rotating the y and z coordinates. Wait, actually, rotating around the x-axis by angle \u03c6 would transform the point (6, 3 cos \u03b8, 3 sin \u03b8) into:\n\nx remains 6,\n\ny = 3 cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6 - 3 sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6,\n\nz = 3 cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6 + 3 sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6,\n\nWait, that's a rotation of the y-z coordinates by angle \u03c6. So, in this case, the coordinates would be:\n\nx =6,\n\ny = 3 [cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6 - sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6] = 3 cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6),\n\nz = 3 [cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6 + sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6] = 3 sin(\u03b8 + \u03c6).\n\nHmm, but this is just parameterizing a circle in the y-z plane at x=6 with radius 3, but rotated by \u03c6. Wait, but this is just the same circle, parameterized with \u03b8 + \u03c6. So essentially, this parametrization is just a single circle, not a torus. \n\nWait, so I must have misunderstood the parametrization. To form a torus, when rotating around the x-axis, each point on the generating circle should trace a circle in the plane perpendicular to the x-axis. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the generating circle is not fixed at x=6, but as we rotate around the x-axis, the center moves along the x-axis? Wait, no. \n\nWait, I think I need to start over.\n\nLet me try to think of the torus as the set of points at distance r from a circle of radius R in some plane. For example, if the generating circle (the center circle) is in the x-y plane, centered at (d,0,0) with radius R, and the torus is formed by moving a circle of radius r around it. Wait, perhaps it's better to use the standard form.\n\nLet me recall that the standard equation for a torus with major radius R (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) and minor radius r (radius of the tube) is:\n\n( sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - R )\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2,\n\nif the torus is centered at the origin and oriented around the z-axis.\n\nSimilarly, if the torus is oriented around the x-axis, then swapping coordinates appropriately:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R )\u00b2 + x\u00b2 = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's check this equation.\n\nSuppose R=6, r=3, so equation is ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 +x\u00b2 = 9.\n\nTesting a point on the generating circle when x=0. Let me see:\n\nAt x=0, the equation becomes ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 =9,\n\nso sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 = \u00b13,\n\nso sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)=9 or 3,\n\nThus, the cross section at x=0 is two circles of radius 9 and 3? That doesn't sound right. The generating circle should be at x=6, so when x=6,\n\nEquation becomes ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + 36 =9,\n\nso ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 = -27,\n\nWhich is impossible. Hmm, so that equation is not correct either.\n\nI think my confusion is arising because I might be mixing up major and minor radii. Let me check the standard equation again.\n\nThe standard equation for a torus around the z-axis, with major radius R (distance from the center to the tube) and minor radius r is:\n\n( sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - R )\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2.\n\nSo, for example, if R=6, r=3,\n\nthen at z=0, the cross-section is (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)-6)^2 =9,\n\nso sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 6 \u00b13,\n\nso two circles of radius 3 and 9 centered at the origin in the z=0 plane. Wait, but that would be a horn torus if R = r, but when R > r, it's a standard torus with an inner radius of R - r and outer radius R + r. Wait, but the cross-section at z=0 would have two circles? That can't be right. Wait, actually, when z=0, the equation is (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - R)^2 = r\u00b2,\n\nso sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = R \u00b1 r,\n\nso two circles at radius R + r and R - r. That makes sense for a torus. The inner radius is R - r and outer radius R + r. So if R=6, r=3, then the cross-section at z=0 is two circles with radii 9 and 3. That is correct. The center circle (the one around which the tube is formed) is at radius R=6, and the tube has radius r=3. So the torus is the region between R - r and R + r from the z-axis.\n\nTherefore, the equation ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R )\u00b2 +x\u00b2 = r\u00b2 would be a torus around the x-axis with major radius R and minor radius r.\n\nWait, let me check with R=6 and r=3:\n\nEquation: ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 +x\u00b2 =9.\n\nAt x=0, sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)=6 \u00b13 \u2192 same as before, two circles. But if the torus is around the x-axis, then cross-sections perpendicular to the x-axis (fixed x) would be annular regions. For example, at x=6, the equation becomes ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)-6 )\u00b2 + 36 =9 \u2192 (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)-6)^2 = -27, which is impossible. Wait, that's not right. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the major radius R is the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the tube. So the center of the torus would be at the origin, so the center of the generating circle is at (R,0,0). Then, when you create the torus around the x-axis, the equation ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R )\u00b2 +x\u00b2 = r\u00b2 would have points where the distance from the x-axis (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)) is R \u00b1 r, but when x is varying. For example, when you are at the \"equator\" of the torus along the x-axis, the maximum x would be R + r, and minimum R - r. Wait, but in this equation, when sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)= R, then x\u00b2 = r\u00b2, so x= \u00b1r. So the center of the generating circle is at (R,0,0). Wait, perhaps the major radius is R, and the minor radius is r, so the distance from the center of the torus (origin) to the center of the tube is R, and the tube has radius r.\n\nIn that case, if we set R=6, the center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0). The tube radius is 3, so the torus extends from x=6 \u00b1 3?\n\nWait, but according to the equation, when y and z are zero, then the equation becomes (0 -6)^2 +x\u00b2 =9 \u2192 36 +x\u00b2 =9 \u2192 x\u00b2 =-27, which is impossible. Hmm, so that's not correct.\n\nI'm clearly making a mistake here. Let me look up the standard equation for a torus parametrized along the x-axis.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the following approach. Let me consider the torus as the set of points at a distance r from a circle of radius R in the plane perpendicular to the axis. For instance, if the axis is the x-axis, then the generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to the x-axis, say at x =0, and centered at (R,0,0). Wait, that might not be.\n\nAlternatively, let me define the generating circle as lying in the plane perpendicular to the x-axis at x = c, with center at (c,0,0). The generating circle has radius r, so any point on the generating circle is (c, r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8). Rotating this around the x-axis would give the torus. The parametrization would then be:\n\nx = c,\n\ny = r cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6,\n\nz = r cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6,\n\nWait, no, rotating around the x-axis would involve rotating the y and z coordinates. Wait, actually, the rotation would move the point (c, r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8) around the x-axis, so the coordinates become:\n\nx = c,\n\ny = r cos \u03b8 cos \u03c6,\n\nz = r cos \u03b8 sin \u03c6,\n\nBut this leaves x fixed, so this is still a circle in the plane x=c. That doesn't form a torus. So this approach is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps the generating circle is not fixed in a plane perpendicular to the axis. Maybe it's in the plane of the axis? Let me try again.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the torus as follows: the center of the generating circle is at (R, 0, 0), and the generating circle is in the x-y plane, so its points are (R + r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8, 0). Then revolving this around the z-axis would give a standard torus. But if we revolve around the x-axis instead, then the generating circle is in the x-y plane, and revolving around the x-axis would involve rotating the y and z coordinates.\n\nWait, the generating circle is (R + r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8, 0). Rotating this around the x-axis would mean that each point (x,y,z) on the torus is obtained by rotating (R + r cos \u03b8, r sin \u03b8, 0) around the x-axis by an angle \u03c6. The rotation around the x-axis leaves x unchanged, and transforms (y,z) into (y cos \u03c6 - z sin \u03c6, y sin \u03c6 + z cos \u03c6). Since z is initially 0, this becomes (y cos \u03c6, y sin \u03c6). Therefore, the coordinates are:\n\nx = R + r cos \u03b8,\n\ny = r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6,\n\nz = r sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6,\n\nwhere \u03b8 and \u03c6 are from 0 to 2\u03c0.\n\nThis is the same parametrization as before. Therefore, the equation of the torus can be found by eliminating \u03b8 and \u03c6 from these equations.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set A = x - R = r cos \u03b8,\n\nB = y / cos \u03c6 = r sin \u03b8,\n\nC = z / sin \u03c6 = r sin \u03b8,\n\nWait, but this might not help. Alternatively, note that:\n\nFrom the parametrization,\n\nx = R + r cos \u03b8,\n\nso cos \u03b8 = (x - R)/r,\n\ny\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 (cos\u00b2\u03c6 + sin\u00b2\u03c6) = r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nTherefore,\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 = (y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/r\u00b2,\n\nand since cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1,\n\n[(x - R)/r]^2 + (y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/r\u00b2 =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by r\u00b2,\n\n(x - R)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, so this is the equation (x - R)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2,\n\nwhich is a sphere of radius r centered at (R,0,0). But that's not a torus. Clearly, something is wrong here.\n\nWait a second, this can't be right. If all points on the torus satisfy (x - R)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2, then it's a sphere. That contradicts the parametrization. So where is the mistake?\n\nThe mistake is that when rotating around the x-axis, the angle \u03c6 affects the y and z coordinates, but in the equations above, when we write y = r sin \u03b8 cos \u03c6 and z = r sin \u03b8 sin \u03c6, then y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 (cos\u00b2\u03c6 + sin\u00b2\u03c6) = r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8, which is independent of \u03c6. That term is r\u00b2 sin\u00b2\u03b8, so indeed, the equation (x - R)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2 holds, because (x - R)^2 = r\u00b2 cos\u00b2\u03b8, so adding gives r\u00b2. Thus, this parametrization actually describes a sphere, not a torus. But that's impossible. Wait, but the parametrization does trace out a sphere. So clearly, my approach is incorrect.\n\nWait, this is very confusing. Maybe I need to consider that rotating the generating circle around an axis in the same plane as the generating circle, not perpendicular to it.\n\nThe problem states: \"the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle\".\n\nAh! The axis is in the plane of the circle. So the circle is in a plane, and the axis is a line in that plane, 6 units from the center. So the generating circle is in, say, the x-y plane, with center at (6,0,0), and the axis of revolution is the y-axis, which is 6 units away from the center. Therefore, the revolution is around the y-axis, not the x-axis. \n\nTherefore, the axis is in the same plane as the generating circle (x-y plane), so the axis is a line in the x-y plane. If the center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0), then the axis (the y-axis) is 6 units away from it. So when we revolve around the y-axis, the resulting torus will have an equation we can write down.\n\nLet me try this again with the correct axis.\n\nGenerating circle in x-y plane: center (6,0,0), radius 3. Axis of revolution is the y-axis.\n\nTherefore, the distance from any point (x,y,z) to the axis (y-axis) is sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2).\n\nThe equation of the torus is then:\n\n( sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - 6 )\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 =9.\n\nYes, this is the same as I had earlier. So that equation is correct. So then the sphere is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121.\n\nSo, substituting s = sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2), then the torus equation is (s -6)^2 + y\u00b2 =9,\n\nand sphere equation is s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =121.\n\nThen subtracting the two equations:\n\n(s\u00b2 -12s +36 + y\u00b2) - (s\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =9 -121,\n\nwhich gives -12s +36 = -112,\n\nso -12s = -148,\n\ns=148/12 =37/3 \u224812.333...\n\nThen substituting back into sphere equation:\n\ny\u00b2 =121 - s\u00b2 =121 - (1369/9)= (1089 -1369)/9 = (-280)/9,\n\nwhich is negative, so no real solution. Contradiction. Hmm.\n\nBut the problem states that when the torus is placed inside the sphere, they are tangent along a circle. So there must be a real solution. Therefore, my mistake is in assuming the center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0). Because then the distance from the origin to the center is 6, but the sphere has radius 11, so maybe the torus has to be positioned such that its center is not at (6,0,0) but closer to the origin?\n\nWait, the problem says \"when T rests on the inside of S\", so the torus must be placed inside the sphere. Perhaps the center of the generating circle is not at (6,0,0) but at some point closer to the origin so that the entire torus is inside the sphere?\n\nWait, but the problem states that the torus is generated by revolving the circle (radius 3, distance 6 from axis). The position of the torus in space can be moved, but the torus's geometry is fixed (major radius 6, minor radius 3). So when placing it inside the sphere, we can position it such that it is tangent. So perhaps the center of the generating circle is not at (6,0,0) in the coordinate system where the sphere is centered at the origin, but shifted towards the origin so that the torus is inside?\n\nAh, this must be the case. The problem doesn't say the torus is centered at the origin, just that when it rests on the inside of the sphere. So the torus can be positioned such that it is tangent. Therefore, the center of the generating circle is at some point along the line connecting the sphere's center (origin) and the torus's generating circle's center. Let me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote the center of the generating circle as point C, located at a distance D from the origin. The axis of revolution (which is 6 units away from C) must be placed such that the entire torus is inside the sphere. To have tangency, the point(s) of tangency must lie along a circle where the distance from the origin to those points is exactly 11 (the sphere's radius), and also lie on the torus.\n\nLet me consider the axis of the torus. Since the axis is in the plane of the generating circle and is 6 units from C, the distance from the origin to the axis will affect the position.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to set up coordinates such that the center of the generating circle C is along the x-axis. Let me place point C at (d, 0, 0), so the generating circle is in the x-y plane, centered at (d,0,0), radius 3. The axis of revolution is in the plane of the circle (x-y plane) and is 6 units from C. Since C is at (d,0,0), the axis is a line in the x-y plane, 6 units away from (d,0,0). Let's choose the axis as the y-axis for simplicity, so the distance between (d,0,0) and the y-axis is |d|. Therefore, according to the problem, this distance must be 6, so d = \u00b16. Wait, but then if the torus is inside the sphere of radius 11, the center C is at (6,0,0), so the distance from the origin to C is 6, which is less than 11, so it's inside. But earlier calculation led to a contradiction.\n\nWait, but in that case, the sphere equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121,\n\nand the torus equation is (sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + y\u00b2 =9,\n\nthen as before, solving these gives s=37/3, which is about 12.333, but sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2)=37/3 would mean that the distance from the origin is sqrt( (37/3)^2 + y\u00b2 ) = sqrt( 1369/9 + y\u00b2 ). But from the sphere equation, that is exactly 11. Wait, hold on, if s = sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2)=37/3,\n\nthen from sphere equation, s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =121,\n\nso y\u00b2 =121 - (37/3)^2,\n\nwhich is 121 - 1369/9 = (1089 -1369)/9 = -280/9,\n\nwhich is negative. So that is impossible. So that suggests that with the center at (6,0,0), the torus does not intersect the sphere, but the problem states it is tangent. So perhaps my assumption that the axis is the y-axis is wrong? Or maybe the axis is not the y-axis?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the axis is not aligned with any coordinate axis. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me suppose that the center of the generating circle is at some point (d, 0, 0), and the axis of revolution is a line in the x-y plane, 6 units away from (d,0,0). Let me choose the axis as the line x = d -6, y=0, z=0 (along the x-axis). So the axis is the x-axis shifted to x = d -6. Wait, but this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to consider the general case.\n\nLet me denote the center of the generating circle as point C, located at vector **C**, and the axis of revolution as a line L in the plane of the circle, at distance 6 from C. The torus is formed by rotating the generating circle around L. To have the torus rest inside the sphere S (centered at origin, radius 11), the torus must be placed such that it is tangent to the sphere along a circle. \n\nThe key is to find the correct position of the torus such that there exists a circle of intersection between the torus and the sphere, with the normals pointing in opposite directions (for internal tangency).\n\nAlternatively, using the method of inversion or geometric considerations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think in terms of the distance from the origin to the torus. The closest point on the torus to the origin would be along the line connecting the origin to the center of the generating circle. Similarly, the farthest point would be in the opposite direction. To have the torus tangent to the sphere, one of these points must lie on the sphere.\n\nWait, for internal tangency, the sphere is larger, so the torus is inside the sphere. The closest point from the torus to the origin would be the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle minus the major radius (distance from center to the axis) minus the minor radius. Wait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the distance from the origin to the closest point on the torus must be equal to the sphere's radius when they are tangent. Wait, no, for internal tangent, the sphere contains the torus and touches it at a point. The distance from the origin to the torus's farthest point should be equal to the sphere's radius.\n\nWait, actually, when two surfaces are tangent internally, the sphere contains the torus, and they touch at a point where the distance from the origin to that point is exactly the sphere's radius. But since it's along a circle, all points on that circle must be at distance 11 from the origin. \n\nAlternatively, consider that the circle of tangency lies in a plane that is at distance h from the origin, and the radius of the circle in that plane relates to h and the sphere's radius. The same circle also lies on the torus, whose geometry depends on its position.\n\nPerhaps it's better to consider the problem in a cross-sectional view. Let me consider the cross-section in the plane that contains the axis of the torus and the center of the sphere (the origin). Let me choose coordinates such that the axis of the torus is along the x-axis, and the center of the generating circle is at (d, 0, 0). The axis of the torus is the x-axis, so the generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to the x-axis at x = d, with center at (d, 0, 0), radius 3. The distance from the center to the axis (x-axis) is |d|, which must be 6, so d = \u00b16. Let's choose d = a, and |a| =6, so a=6 or -6. Let me choose a positive distance so that the center is at (6,0,0). \n\nWait, but then as before, the sphere's equation and the torus equation lead to inconsistency. So perhaps the center is not along the x-axis?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the axis of the torus is not aligned with any coordinate axis, but let's suppose that the center of the generating circle is along the line connecting the origin to the axis of the torus. Let me try to parameterize this.\n\nSuppose the center of the generating circle is at point C, located at vector **C**, and the axis L is a line at distance 6 from C, in the plane of the generating circle. To simplify, let me place the system such that C is along the x-axis, so C = (c, 0, 0). The axis L must then be a line in the x-y plane at distance 6 from C. Let me choose the axis L to be the line x = c -6, y=0 (along the x-axis). So the distance between point C (c,0,0) and the axis L (x = c-6, y=0) is 6 units, which satisfies the problem's condition.\n\nTherefore, the torus is obtained by rotating the generating circle (center at (c,0,0), radius 3) around the line L: x = c -6, y=0 (the x-axis shifted to x = c -6). This might complicate the equations, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, to simplify, let me shift coordinates so that the axis L is the y-axis. Let me set the center of the generating circle at (6,0,0), so that the distance to the y-axis (the axis of revolution) is 6 units. Then the torus equation is as I had before: (sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 9. However, when we place this torus inside the sphere centered at the origin with radius 11, the equations give a contradiction. \n\nBut the problem states that such a configuration exists, so maybe the center of the generating circle isn't at (6,0,0) but at some other point (d,0,0), with d \u22606, such that the distance from (d,0,0) to the axis is still 6. Wait, the problem says the axis is in the plane of the circle and is a distance 6 from the center. So if the generating circle's center is at (d,0,0), the axis must be a line in the same plane (the x-y plane) at distance 6 from (d,0,0). So for example, the axis could be the line x= d -6, y=0, which is 6 units away from (d,0,0). Therefore, the axis is not fixed at the origin's coordinate system, but depends on d. \n\nTherefore, perhaps I need to set up the equations with variable d, then impose the condition that the torus is tangent to the sphere, and solve for d. Then compute r_i and r_o accordingly.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nLet me denote the center of the generating circle as (d, 0, 0), so the distance from this center to the axis (which is the line x = d -6, y=0) is 6 units. The torus is formed by rotating the generating circle around this axis.\n\nTo find the equation of the torus in this coordinate system, it's a bit involved, but let me consider the following:\n\nThe axis of the torus is the line L: x = d -6, y=0, z=0. The generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to L at point (d,0,0), so the plane is perpendicular to the x-axis (since L is along the x-axis). The generating circle has center at (d,0,0) and radius 3.\n\nWhen rotating around the axis L (which is along the x-axis at x = d-6), the torus can be parametrized as follows:\n\nTake a point on the generating circle: (d + 3 cos\u03b8, 3 sin\u03b8, 0).\n\nTo rotate this around the axis L (the x-axis at x = d -6), we need to translate the coordinate system so that the axis L is at the origin, perform the rotation, then translate back.\n\nLet me shift coordinates so that the axis L is at the origin. Let me define a new coordinate system (x', y', z') where x' = x - (d -6), y' = y, z' = z.\n\nIn this translated system, the generating circle's center is at (d - (d -6), 0, 0) = (6, 0, 0). The generating circle is now at (6 + 3 cos\u03b8, 3 sin\u03b8, 0). Rotating this around the x'-axis (the axis L) gives the parametrization:\n\nx' =6 + 3 cos\u03b8,\n\ny' = 3 sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6,\n\nz' = 3 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6,\n\nwhere \u03c6 is the rotation angle around the x'-axis.\n\nNow, translating back to original coordinates:\n\nx = x' + (d -6) =6 + 3 cos\u03b8 + (d -6) = d + 3 cos\u03b8,\n\ny = y' = 3 sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6,\n\nz = z' = 3 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6.\n\nThus, the parametrization of the torus in the original coordinates is:\n\nx = d + 3 cos\u03b8,\n\ny = 3 sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6,\n\nz = 3 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6.\n\nNow, let's derive the equation of the torus. Let me express in terms of x, y, z.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s set A = x - d =3 cos\u03b8,\n\nB\u00b2 + C\u00b2 = (3 sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6)^2 + (3 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)^2 =9 sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nThus,\n\nA =3 cos\u03b8,\n\nB\u00b2 + C\u00b2 =9 sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nTherefore,\n\n(A/3)^2 + (B\u00b2 + C\u00b2)/9 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1,\n\nSo,\n\n[(x -d)/3]^2 + (y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/9 =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by 9:\n\n(x -d)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =9.\n\nWait, that's the equation of a sphere of radius 3 centered at (d,0,0). This can't be correct because we were supposed to get a torus. Clearly, there's an error in this derivation.\n\nWait, but this is the same issue as before. The parametrization leads to a sphere equation, which is impossible. This must mean that I have misunderstood the parametrization.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is incorrect because rotating around an axis parallel to the x-axis but offset requires a different treatment. Maybe the equation isn't a sphere but something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider the distance from any point on the torus to the axis L.\n\nThe axis L is the line x = d -6, y=0, z=0. The distance from a point (x,y,z) to this axis can be computed as follows:\n\nThe distance from a point to a line in 3D. The line L can be parametrized as (d -6 + t, 0, 0), where t is a parameter.\n\nThe vector from a point P(x,y,z) to a point on L, say Q(d -6,0,0), is (x - (d -6), y, z).\n\nThe direction vector of L is along the x-axis, so direction vector **v** = (1,0,0).\n\nThe distance from P to L is the magnitude of the cross product of **PQ** and **v**, divided by |**v**|.\n\n**PQ** = (x - (d -6), y, z),\n\n**v** = (1,0,0),\n\nCross product **PQ** \u00d7 **v** = (0*0 - z*0, z*1 - y*0, y*0 - 0*1) = (0, z, -y).\n\nThe magnitude squared is 0\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = y\u00b2 + z\u00b2,\n\nThus, the distance is sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the distance from any point (x,y,z) on the torus to the axis L is sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2).\n\nThe equation of the torus is then the set of points where this distance differs from the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis by the radius of the generating circle.\n\nThe center of the generating circle is at (d,0,0). The distance from this center to the axis L is |d - (d -6)| =6 units. The generating circle has radius 3, so the equation of the torus is:\n\n| sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 | =3,\n\nbut also accounting for the position along the axis.\n\nWait, no. The standard equation for a torus is |distance from axis - major radius| = minor radius?\n\nWait, the standard equation is (distance from axis - major radius)^2 + (along axis coordinate)^2 = minor radius^2 ?\n\nWait, no, let me think again.\n\nThe generating circle is centered at (d,0,0), which is 6 units away from the axis L. The generating circle has radius 3. When rotating around L, the points on the torus will have a distance from L ranging from 6 - 3 =3 to 6 +3=9. The along-axis coordinate (along L's direction, which is the x-axis here) will vary.\n\nThe parametrization earlier gave us points where x =d +3 cos\u03b8,\n\nso the coordinate along the axis (the x-axis) is x, which can be written as (x - (d -6)) + (d -6) = something?\n\nAlternatively, the coordinate along the axis L is the x-coordinate relative to the axis. The axis L is along the x-axis at x =d -6, so the coordinate along L is x - (d -6).\n\nTherefore, the equation of the torus should be:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + (x - (d -6))\u00b2 = 3\u00b2.\n\nAh! This is the correct equation.\n\nSo finally, the equation of the torus is:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + (x - (d -6))\u00b2 =9.\n\nNow, this makes sense. Let me verify with the parametrization.\n\nFrom the parametrization earlier:\n\nx = d +3 cos\u03b8,\n\nthen x - (d -6) =6 +3 cos\u03b8,\n\nsqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)= sqrt( (3 sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6)^2 + (3 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)^2 )= 3 |sin\u03b8|,\n\nBut in the equation,\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + (x - (d -6))\u00b2 = (3 |sin\u03b8| -6)^2 + (6 +3 cos\u03b8)^2.\n\nWait, but this must equal 9?\n\nLet me compute with \u03b8=0,\n\nthen sin\u03b8=0,\n\nso (0 -6)^2 + (6 +3)^2 =36 +81=117 \u22609.\n\nHmm, not correct. So perhaps I still have an error.\n\nWait, maybe the along-axis coordinate is different. Let me think again.\n\nThe axis L is the x-axis shifted to x =d -6, so the coordinate along the axis is x - (d -6). The generating circle is located at x =d, so the displacement from the axis along the x-axis is 6 units. The generating circle's points have coordinates (d +3 cos\u03b8, 3 sin\u03b8,0). The distance from the axis L is sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)=3|sin\u03b8|,\n\nand the displacement along the axis is (x - (d -6)) = d +3 cos\u03b8 - (d-6)=6 +3 cos\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the equation should be:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + (x - (d -6))\u00b2 = (3)^2,\n\nWait, but when \u03b8=0,\n\nsqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)=0,\n\nso equation becomes ( -6)^2 + (6 +3)^2 =36 +81=117, which is not 9. So this is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Alternatively, perhaps the equation should be (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (distance from center to axis))^2 + (along axis coordinate - center position)^2 = (minor radius)^2.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-derive the equation properly.\n\nLet me consider that any point on the torus can be expressed as a point on the generating circle, then rotated around the axis L.\n\nThe generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to L at point C=(d,0,0). The distance from C to L is 6 units. The generating circle has radius 3. \n\nLet me consider a general point on the generating circle: the vector from C to the point is perpendicular to L's direction (since the generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to L). Let me suppose that L is along the x-axis at x= d-6, so the direction of L is along the x-axis. The plane perpendicular to L at point C is the y-z plane at x=d.\n\nA point on the generating circle can be written as (d, 3 cos\u03b8, 3 sin\u03b8).\n\nRotating this point around the axis L (the x-axis at x =d -6) involves rotating around the x-axis, but shifted along x. To compute the rotation, it's easier to translate the coordinate system so that the axis L is at the origin.\n\nLet me perform a coordinate shift: let x' =x - (d -6). Then, the point C=(d,0,0) becomes (6,0,0) in the translated coordinates. The generating circle is at x'=6, with points (6, 3 cos\u03b8, 3 sin\u03b8).\n\nRotating this point around the x'-axis (the axis L in the translated system) gives:\n\nx' =6,\n\ny'=3 cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6,\n\nz'=3 cos\u03b8 sin\u03c6,\n\nWait, no, rotating around the x'-axis would leave x' unchanged, and rotate the y'-z' coordinates. The original point is (6, 3 cos\u03b8, 3 sin\u03b8). Rotating this by angle \u03c6 around the x'-axis gives:\n\ny' =3 cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 - 3 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6,\n\nz' =3 cos\u03b8 sin\u03c6 + 3 sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6.\n\nAlternatively, using the standard rotation matrix:\n\nThe rotation by \u03c6 around x-axis:\n\ny' = y cos\u03c6 - z sin\u03c6,\n\nz' = y sin\u03c6 + z cos\u03c6.\n\nApplied to the generating point (6, 3 cos\u03b8, 3 sin\u03b8):\n\ny' =3 cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 -3 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6,\n\nz' =3 cos\u03b8 sin\u03c6 +3 sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6.\n\nThus, the coordinates in the translated system are:\n\nx'=6,\n\ny'=3 [cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 - sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6] =3 cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6),\n\nz'=3 [cos\u03b8 sin\u03c6 + sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6] =3 sin(\u03b8 + \u03c6).\n\nTherefore, in the translated coordinates, the torus equation is x'=6, y'\u00b2 + z'\u00b2 =9,\n\nwhich is a cylinder of radius 3 at x'=6. But when translated back, this becomes x =d -6 +6 =d,\n\ny\u00b2 + z\u00b2=9,\n\nwhich is a circle in the plane x=d. That can't be right; rotating a circle around an axis should give a torus. But this suggests that the equation is incorrect.\n\nWait, no, because we were rotating around the x'-axis, but the generating circle is already in the plane perpendicular to the axis. Rotating it around the axis would trace out a torus, but in the translated coordinates, it's a cylinder at x'=6, which when translated back is x=d. That suggests that my coordinate shift is leading to a misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my mistake is in the axis direction. If the generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to the axis, then rotating it around the axis should trace out a torus where the major radius is the distance from the center to the axis, and the minor radius is the generating circle's radius.\n\nTherefore, in translated coordinates, the equation should be (sqrt(y'\u00b2 + z'\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x' -6)^2 = 3\u00b2,\n\nWait, but in that case, when we set y'=0,z'=0, then (0 -6)^2 + (x' -6)^2 =9,\n\nso (x' -6)^2 = -27, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I should try a different approach.\n\nLet me consider that when the torus is tangent to the sphere, the point of tangency must satisfy both equations and their normals must be colinear. Let me consider the case where the torus is inside the sphere.\n\nLet me denote the center of the generating circle as point C at (d,0,0). The distance from C to the axis of the torus is 6, so the axis is the line x =d-6, y=0, etc.\n\nThe equation of the torus in this case would be:\n\nThe distance from any point P(x,y,z) on the torus to the axis L is sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). The distance from the center C to the axis is 6. The torus is formed by points where this distance varies by \u00b1 the minor radius (3). Additionally, the coordinate along the axis (x direction) must account for the center's position.\n\nThus, the equation of the torus should be:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + (x - (d -6))\u00b2 = 3\u00b2,\n\nYes, this seems correct. Let me verify with a point on the generating circle. Take the point (d, 3,0). This is on the generating circle, so it should be on the torus.\n\nPlugging into the equation:\n\nsqrt(3\u00b2 +0) -6 =3-6=-3,\n\nthen squared is 9,\n\nand (d - (d-6))\u00b2 =6\u00b2=36,\n\nso total 9+36=45\u22609. Wait, no, that's not right.\n\nWait, the generating point (d, 3,0) is at x=d, so x - (d-6)=6,\n\nso ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 +6\u00b2 = (3-6)^2 +36=9+36=45.\n\nBut this should equal 9. Not correct.\n\nHmm, so perhaps the equation is different. Maybe it's ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + ( (x - d)/3 )\u00b2 =1 ?\n\nLet me try with the generating point (d,3,0):\n\nsqrt(3\u00b2 +0) -6= -3,\n\nso squared is 9,\n\nand ( (d -d)/3 )\u00b2 =0,\n\nso total is 9\u22601. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + (x -d)^2 =3\u00b2,\n\nTesting the generating point (d,3,0):\n\nsqrt(3\u00b2 +0) -6= -3,\n\nsquared is9,\n\n(x -d)^2=0,\n\nso 9+0=9. That works.\n\nAnother test: point on the axis direction. Take a point where y=z=0. Then,\n\n(0 -6)^2 + (x -d)^2 =9,\n\nso 36 + (x -d)^2 =9,\n\n(x-d)^2 =-27. No solution. That's not good.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the equation is ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (distance from center to axis) )\u00b2 + ( (x - center_x)/something )^2 = (minor radius)^2.\n\nWait, let me think of the standard torus equation. If the axis is along the x-axis, and the center of the generating circle is at (d,0,0), distance from center to axis is |d|. Then the equation is (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - |d| )\u00b2 + (x -d)^2 = r\u00b2,\n\nwhere r is the minor radius.\n\nWait, if that's the case, then for our problem:\n\ndistance from center to axis is 6, so |d|=6,\n\nso the equation becomes (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x -d)^2=9.\n\nIf d=6,\n\nthen equation is (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x-6)^2=9.\n\nTesting the generating point (6,3,0):\n\nsqrt(9) -6=-3,\n\nsquared is9,\n\n(x-6)^2=0,\n\ntotal 9. Good.\n\nAnother test: point along the axis at x=6, y=0,z=0,\n\nthen (0-6)^2 +0=36\u22609. Not on the torus. Makes sense, since the generating circle is at x=6, but the center is also there, so the distance from the axis is 6, so sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)=0 gives ( -6)^2 + (x-6)^2 =36 +0=36\u22609, so that point is not on the torus. Correct.\n\nAnother test: the point on the generating circle at (6,0,3):\n\nsqrt(0+9)=3,\n\nso (3-6)^2 + (x-6)^2 =9 +0=9. Good.\n\nNow, the point at x=6+3=9, y=0,z=0,\n\n(sqrt(0) -6)^2 + (9-6)^2= ( -6)^2 +9=36+9=45\u22609. Not on the torus. Correct.\n\nSo the equation (sqrt(y\u00b2 +z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x -d)^2 =9 is correct when the center of the generating circle is at (d,0,0) and the axis is the x-axis at distance |d|=6 from the center.\n\nTherefore, the correct equation of the torus is, assuming the center is at (d,0,0) and the axis is the x-axis at distance 6 from the center (so d=\u00b16), the equation is:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + (x -d)^2 =9.\n\nNow, the sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=121.\n\nWe need to find the value of d such that the torus is tangent to the sphere. Additionally, since the torus can be placed either inside or outside the sphere, we need to consider both cases.\n\nFirst, let's consider the case when the torus is inside the sphere (internally tangent). The center of the generating circle (d,0,0) must be positioned such that the entire torus is inside the sphere, and they touch along a circle.\n\nThe points of tangency must satisfy both equations and their normals must be colinear.\n\nLet me consider the equations:\n\nTorus: ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + (x -d)^2 =9,\n\nSphere: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121.\n\nLet me denote s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Then the torus equation becomes:\n\n(s -6)^2 + (x -d)^2 =9,\n\nand the sphere equation gives s\u00b2 +x\u00b2 =121.\n\nWe can try to solve these equations simultaneously.\n\nExpand the torus equation:\n\ns\u00b2 -12s +36 +x\u00b2 -2d x +d\u00b2 =9,\n\nSubstitute s\u00b2 +x\u00b2=121 into this:\n\n121 -12s +36 -2d x +d\u00b2=9,\n\nSimplify:\n\n(121 +36) -12s -2d x +d\u00b2 =9,\n\n157 -12s -2d x +d\u00b2 =9,\n\nRearranged:\n\n-12s -2d x +d\u00b2 = -148,\n\nDivide both sides by -2:\n\n6s +d x -d\u00b2/2=74.\n\nHmm, but this seems complex. Maybe we can find a relationship between x and s.\n\nAlternatively, since the surfaces are tangent, their gradients must be colinear at the points of tangency. The gradient of the sphere is (2x, 2y, 2z), and the gradient of the torus can be computed.\n\nLet me compute the gradients.\n\nFor the sphere: \u2207(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 -121) = (2x, 2y, 2z).\n\nFor the torus: Let me write the equation as F(x,y,z)= (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x -d)^2 -9 =0.\n\nCompute partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202F/\u2202x = 2(x -d),\n\n\u2202F/\u2202y = 2(sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)*(y / sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)),\n\n\u2202F/\u2202z = 2(sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)*(z / sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)),\n\nThus, the gradient of F is:\n\n\u2207F = [2(x -d),\n\n2(y (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)/s ),\n\n2(z (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)/s ) ]\n\nWhere s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2).\n\nFor the gradients to be colinear, there must exist a scalar \u03bb such that:\n\n2x = \u03bb * 2(x -d),\n\n2y = \u03bb * 2y (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)/s,\n\n2z = \u03bb * 2z (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)/s.\n\nSimplify:\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\nx = \u03bb (x -d) \u2192 \u03bb = x / (x -d),\n\nFrom the second equation:\n\ny = \u03bb y (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)/s,\n\nAssuming y \u22600, divide both sides by y:\n\n1 = \u03bb (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)/s,\n\nSince s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2), this becomes:\n\n1 = \u03bb (s -6)/s \u2192 \u03bb = s/(s -6),\n\nSimilarly from the third equation (assuming z \u22600):\n\n1 = \u03bb (s -6)/s \u2192 same as above.\n\nTherefore, combining the expressions for \u03bb from the first equation and from the second equation:\n\nFrom first equation: \u03bb = x/(x -d),\n\nFrom second equation: \u03bb = s/(s -6),\n\nThus,\n\nx/(x -d) = s/(s -6),\n\nCross multiplying:\n\nx(s -6) = s(x -d),\n\nExpand:\n\nxs -6x = xs -sd,\n\nCancel xs:\n\n-6x = -sd \u2192 6x = sd \u2192 x = (sd)/6.\n\nSo we have x = (sd)/6.\n\nNow, we also have from the sphere equation: x\u00b2 + s\u00b2 =121,\n\nand from the torus equation:\n\n(s -6)^2 + (x -d)^2 =9.\n\nLet me substitute x = (sd)/6 into these equations.\n\nFirst, substitute into the torus equation:\n\n(s -6)^2 + ( (sd/6) -d )^2 =9,\n\nFactor out d in the second term:\n\n= (s -6)^2 + [d (s/6 -1)]^2 =9,\n\nExpand:\n\n= s\u00b2 -12s +36 + d\u00b2 ( (s/6 -1)^2 ) =9,\n\nAlso, from the sphere equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = ( (sd/6)^2 ) + s\u00b2 = s\u00b2 (d\u00b2/36 +1 ) =121,\n\nThus,\n\ns\u00b2 ( (d\u00b2 +36)/36 ) =121,\n\nTherefore,\n\ns\u00b2 = (121 *36)/(d\u00b2 +36).\n\nNow, let's go back to the modified torus equation:\n\ns\u00b2 -12s +36 + d\u00b2 ( (s/6 -1)^2 ) =9,\n\nExpand the d\u00b2 term:\n\nd\u00b2 ( (s\u00b2/36 - s/3 +1) ) = d\u00b2*(s\u00b2/36) - (d\u00b2 s)/3 + d\u00b2,\n\nThus, plugging back into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 -12s +36 + (d\u00b2 s\u00b2)/36 - (d\u00b2 s)/3 + d\u00b2 =9,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ns\u00b2 + (d\u00b2 s\u00b2)/36 -12s - (d\u00b2 s)/3 +36 +d\u00b2 =9,\n\nFactor s\u00b2 terms:\n\ns\u00b2(1 + d\u00b2/36) - s(12 + (d\u00b2)/3 ) + (36 +d\u00b2 -9)=0,\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n36 +d\u00b2 -9 =d\u00b2 +27,\n\nThus:\n\ns\u00b2( (36 +d\u00b2)/36 ) - s( (36 +d\u00b2d)/12 ) + (d\u00b2 +27)=0,\n\nWait, perhaps better to multiply all terms by 36 to eliminate denominators:\n\n36*s\u00b2 -36*12 s -36* (d\u00b2 s)/3 +36*d\u00b2 s\u00b2/36 + ... Wait, maybe better to re-express step-by-step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps substitute s\u00b2 from the sphere equation into the torus equation.\n\nWe have s\u00b2 = (121*36)/(d\u00b2 +36),\n\nand s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2).\n\nLet me denote s as a variable and substitute s\u00b2 = 121*36/(d\u00b2 +36),\n\nthen s = sqrt( (121*36)/(d\u00b2 +36) ).\n\nPlugging into the torus equation expression:\n\ns\u00b2 -12s +36 + d\u00b2 ( (s/6 -1)^2 ) =9,\n\nReplace s\u00b2 with 121*36/(d\u00b2 +36):\n\n[121*36/(d\u00b2 +36)] -12s +36 +d\u00b2*( (s/6 -1)^2 ) =9,\n\nThis is getting very complicated. Perhaps there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, assume that the circle of tangency lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the sphere and torus. Since the sphere is centered at the origin and the torus's center is at (d,0,0), the line connecting them is along the x-axis. Thus, the plane of tangency is perpendicular to the x-axis, i.e., a plane of constant x. In this plane, the intersection with the sphere is a circle of radius sqrt(121 -x\u00b2), and the intersection with the torus is also a circle. For them to be tangent, these circles must have the same radius and center.\n\nWait, this might be the key. Let me consider that the tangent circle lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers (the x-axis). So let's consider the cross-section at a particular x-coordinate.\n\nLet the plane be x = k. In this plane:\n\nThe sphere's equation gives y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121 -k\u00b2,\n\nso radius sqrt(121 -k\u00b2).\n\nThe torus equation in this plane:\n\n(s -6)^2 + (k -d)^2 =9,\n\nwhere s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2).\n\nThus, s\u00b2 = (6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ))^2,\n\nWait, solving for s:\n\n(s -6)^2 =9 - (k -d)^2,\n\nso s =6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ).\n\nThe intersection of the torus with the plane x=k is two circles with radii sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ) centered at a distance s from the origin in the y-z plane. Wait, no, actually, in the plane x=k, the torus equation becomes:\n\n(s -6)^2 + (k -d)^2 =9,\n\nso s =6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2).\n\nThe intersection of the torus with the plane x=k is two circles in the y-z plane with radius sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ), centered at a distance s from the origin? Wait, no, the s in the equation is sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2), so the equation in the plane x=k is:\n\nsqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) =6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2).\n\nThus, the intersection is two circles in the y-z plane with radii |sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 )| and centers at distance 6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ) from the origin along the radial direction.\n\nWait, no, actually, the equation sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = c corresponds to a circle of radius |c| centered at the origin in the y-z plane. Wait, no, sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)=c implies y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=c\u00b2, so it's a circle of radius |c| centered at the origin in the y-z plane.\n\nTherefore, in the plane x=k, the torus intersects in two circles with radii |6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2)|. However, the sqrt must be real, so 9 - (k -d)^2 \u22650 \u2192 (k -d)^2 \u22649.\n\nThe sphere in that plane has a circle of radius sqrt(121 -k\u00b2).\n\nFor the torus and sphere to be tangent in this plane, one of the circles from the torus must coincide with the sphere's circle. That is, their radii must be equal and their centers must coincide.\n\nBut the sphere's circle is centered at the origin in the y-z plane, and the torus's circles are also centered at the origin? Wait, yes, because sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)=c is centered at the origin. So if in the plane x=k, the torus has a circle with radius |6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2)| and the sphere has radius sqrt(121 -k\u00b2), then for them to be tangent, these radii must be equal, and the centers must coincide (which they do at the origin). Therefore, the condition is:\n\n6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2) = \u00b1 sqrt(121 -k\u00b2),\n\nBut since radii are positive, we can drop the signs:\n\nEither 6 + sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2) = sqrt(121 -k\u00b2),\n\nor 6 - sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2) = sqrt(121 -k\u00b2).\n\nBut since the torus is inside the sphere for internal tangent, the radius of the torus's circle in the plane must be less than the sphere's radius. So likely the second equation:\n\n6 - sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2) = sqrt(121 -k\u00b2),\n\nWait, but the sphere's radius is larger, so the torus's radius must be equal but on the inside. Wait, actually, for internal tangent, the sphere contains the torus, so the torus's circle must lie entirely within the sphere's circle, touching at exactly one point (a circle). So the radii must be equal, but the torus's circle must be on the inside. Therefore, the torus's radius must be equal to the sphere's radius subtracted by some distance? Not sure. Maybe the equation is:\n\nThe radius of the torus's circle plus the distance from the origin to the torus's center equals the sphere's radius?\n\nWait, perhaps better to set the radii equal:\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2) = 6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ).\n\nBut since the sphere's radius is larger, sqrt(121 -k\u00b2) must be equal to 6 + sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ) for the torus to be externally tangent, or 6 - sqrt(...) for internal tangent.\n\nAssuming internal tangent (torus inside sphere), the torus's circle lies within the sphere's circle, so the radius of the torus's circle must be equal to the difference between the sphere's radius and the distance from the origin.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Let's proceed with the equations.\n\nLet me consider the case of internal tangency first.\n\nAssume that in the plane x=k, the torus's circle (with radius r_i) is tangent to the sphere's circle (radius R= sqrt(121 -k\u00b2)) internally. This requires that the distance between the centers (which are both at the origin in this plane) plus the torus's radius equals the sphere's radius? No, since they're concentric, the only way they can be tangent is if their radii are equal. Wait, if they are concentric circles, then they can only be tangent if they have the same radius, but then they would coincide entirely, which is a circle of tangency. But the problem states that they are tangent along a circle, so that must be the case.\n\nThus, the radii must be equal:\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2) =6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ).\n\nWe need to choose the sign such that the torus is inside the sphere. The torus's radius in this plane is either 6 + sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ) or 6 - sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ). Since it's inside, the torus's radius must be less than the sphere's radius, so we take the minus sign:\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2) =6 - sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ).\n\nWait, but sqrt(121 -k\u00b2) is the sphere's radius, which is larger than the torus's radius (which would be 6 - ...), so the equation would be:\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2) =6 - sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ). But the RHS would be less than 6, but sqrt(121 -k\u00b2) can be up to 11, so this might not hold. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way.\n\nWait, perhaps the external and internal cases are determined by the sign.\n\nLet me consider that for internal tangency, the torus is inside the sphere, so the sphere's radius at that plane must be equal to the torus's outer radius:\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2) =6 + sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ),\n\nand for external tangency, the sphere's radius equals the torus's inner radius:\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2)=6 - sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ).\n\nThus, for internal tangent (resting inside), we have the equation:\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2) =6 + sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ).\n\nSimilarly, for external tangent (resting outside), but the problem says \"externally tangent\", so perhaps the equation would be different. Wait, the external case would have the sphere outside the torus. The torus is outside the sphere, so the sphere's radius at the plane would be equal to the torus's inner radius:\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2)=6 - sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ).\n\nBut since the sphere is fixed, we need to adjust d accordingly.\n\nNow, we have to find the value of d such that this equation holds for some k, and also the condition must hold for all points on the circle of tangency, so this must be true for a particular k where the tangency occurs. Additionally, the position must be such that the entire torus is inside/outside the sphere.\n\nLet me focus on the internal tangent case first:\n\nEquation: sqrt(121 -k\u00b2) =6 + sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ).\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\n121 -k\u00b2 =36 + 12 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ) +9 - (k -d)^2,\n\nSimplify:\n\n121 -k\u00b2 =45 +12 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ) - (k -d)^2,\n\nBring all terms to left except the sqrt term:\n\n121 -k\u00b2 -45 + (k -d)^2 =12 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ),\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n(121-45) + (k -d)^2 -k\u00b2 =76 + (k\u00b2 -2dk +d\u00b2) -k\u00b2 =76 -2dk +d\u00b2,\n\nThus:\n\n76 -2dk +d\u00b2 =12 sqrt(9 - (k -d)^2 ).\n\nLet me denote m =k -d,\n\nthen k =m +d,\n\nso substituting,\n\nLeft side:\n\n76 -2d(m +d) +d\u00b2 =76 -2dm -2d\u00b2 +d\u00b2=76 -2dm -d\u00b2,\n\nRight side:\n\n12 sqrt(9 -m^2 ).\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n76 -2dm -d\u00b2 =12 sqrt(9 -m^2 ).\n\nThis still has two variables m and d. To proceed, maybe we can find another equation.\n\nAlternatively, note that the point of tangency must also lie on both surfaces, so substituting back into the sphere equation and the torus equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assume that the point of tangency is along the line connecting the centers of the sphere (origin) and the torus's generating circle center (d,0,0). That is, along the x-axis. Therefore, in this case, y=z=0, so the point is (k,0,0). Thus, substituting y=z=0 into the equations.\n\nFor the sphere: k\u00b2 =121,\n\nso k=\u00b111,\n\nbut since the torus is inside, k must be between -11 and 11,\n\nbut in the plane x=k where the tangency occurs, the torus must also be present.\n\nIn the torus equation with y=z=0,\n\n(0 -6)^2 + (k -d)^2 =9,\n\n36 + (k -d)^2=9,\n\n(k -d)^2 =-27,\n\nImpossible. Thus, the point of tangency cannot be along the x-axis. Therefore, my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the point of tangency must lie off the x-axis. Hence, we need to solve the equation in terms of m and d.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can choose a coordinate system where d is along the x-axis, and the center of the generating circle is at (d,0,0), so the problem reduces to finding d such that the equations have a common solution with the gradients colinear, and then find the radius of the circle of tangency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for the torus to be tangent to the sphere, the minimum distance from the sphere's center (origin) to the torus must be equal to 11 for external, or the maximum distance equal to 11 for internal? Wait, no. For internal tangent, the maximum distance from the origin to any point on the torus equals the sphere's radius 11. For external tangent, the minimum distance equals the sphere's radius.\n\nWait, let's think of it this way:\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, there exists at least one point on the torus that is at distance 11 from the origin (the point of tangency), and all other points are inside.\n\nSimilarly, when the torus is outside and tangent, there exists a point on the torus at distance 11 from the origin (the tangency point), and all other points are farther.\n\nThus, we can compute the maximum distance from the origin to the torus for internal tangent, set it to 11, and minimum distance for external tangent set to 11.\n\nLet me compute the maximum distance from the origin to a point on the torus.\n\nA general point on the torus has coordinates (x,y,z) satisfying (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x -d)^2 =9.\n\nThe distance squared from the origin is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2),\n\nso the distance squared is x\u00b2 + s\u00b2.\n\nFrom the torus equation: (s -6)^2 + (x -d)^2 =9,\n\nExpand: s\u00b2 -12s +36 +x\u00b2 -2dx +d\u00b2 =9,\n\nThus, x\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 2dx +12s -d\u00b2 -27.\n\nTherefore, the distance squared from the origin is 2dx +12s -d\u00b2 -27.\n\nTo find the maximum or minimum of this expression, subject to the constraints of the torus equation.\n\nAlternatively, parameterize the torus in terms of angles. Let me use the parameterization I had earlier where the center is at (d,0,0), axis is x-axis at x=d-6.\n\nThe parametrization was:\n\nx =d +3 cos\u03b8,\n\ny=3 sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6,\n\nz=3 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6.\n\nThe distance squared from the origin is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2= (d +3 cos\u03b8)^2 +9 sin\u00b2\u03b8 (cos\u00b2\u03c6 + sin\u00b2\u03c6)= (d +3 cos\u03b8)^2 +9 sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nExpand:\n\nd\u00b2 +6d cos\u03b8 +9 cos\u00b2\u03b8 +9 sin\u00b2\u03b8= d\u00b2 +6d cos\u03b8 +9 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8)=d\u00b2 +6d cos\u03b8 +9.\n\nThus, the distance squared is d\u00b2 +6d cos\u03b8 +9.\n\nTo find the maximum/minimum distance from the origin to the torus, we can analyze this expression over \u03b8.\n\nThe expression d\u00b2 +6d cos\u03b8 +9 attains its maximum when cos\u03b8=1 and minimum when cos\u03b8=-1.\n\nThus:\n\nMaximum distance squared: d\u00b2 +6d +9 = (d +3)^2,\n\nMinimum distance squared: d\u00b2 -6d +9 = (d -3)^2,\n\nTherefore, the maximum distance is |d +3|,\n\nand the minimum distance is |d -3|.\n\nTherefore, for the torus to be tangent to the internal sphere (resting inside), the maximum distance from the origin to the torus must be exactly 11:\n\n|d +3|=11,\n\nsince d is a distance along the x-axis, and if the torus is inside, then d is such that d +3 is positive. So,\n\nd +3 =11 \u2192 d=8,\n\nor d +3 =-11 \u2192 d=-14,\n\nbut since the torus must be inside the sphere, and the generating circle's center is at (d,0,0), if d is positive, the maximum distance is d+3, so to have that equal 11, d=8.\n\nAlternatively, d could be negative, but then the maximum distance could also be |d+3|. If d is negative and large in magnitude, the maximum distance could be larger. For example, d=-14 gives |d+3|=11, but the minimum distance would be |-14 -3|=17>11, which means the torus extends beyond the sphere, so it cannot be inside. Thus, the valid solution is d=8.\n\nSimilarly, for the external tangent (torus outside the sphere), the minimum distance from the origin to the torus must be 11:\n\n|d -3|=11,\n\nso d -3=\u00b111 \u2192 d=14 or d=-8.\n\nSince the torus is outside, the generating circle's center must be positioned such that the torus does not enter the sphere. Taking d=14,\n\nminimum distance is |14 -3|=11,\n\nand the maximum distance would be 14+3=17>11, so it's valid.\n\nAlternatively, d=-8,\n\nminimum distance |-8 -3|=11,\n\nbut then the maximum distance |-8 +3|=5 <11, which would place part of the torus inside the sphere, which contradicts external tangent. So the valid solution is d=14.\n\nTherefore, for internal tangent (d=8), the maximum distance is 11, and for external tangent (d=14), the minimum distance is 11.\n\nNow, having found d=8 for internal and d=14 for external, we can compute the radii r_i and r_o of the circles of tangency.\n\nThe radius of the circle of tangency is the radius of the intersection of the torus and the sphere in the plane where the maximum/minimum distance occurs.\n\nFor internal tangent (d=8):\n\nThe maximum distance occurs when cos\u03b8=1, i.e., \u03b8=0,\n\nwhich corresponds to the point (d +3,0,0)=(11,0,0),\n\nso the plane of tangency is the one perpendicular to the x-axis at x=11?\n\nWait, no, the maximum distance is achieved at that point, but the circle of tangency is the set of points where the distance is 11. Since the maximum distance is 11, all points on the torus at that maximum distance form a circle.\n\nThe points on the torus where distance from origin is 11 are those with:\n\ndistance squared = (d +3)^2 =121,\n\nwhich occurs when cos\u03b8=1, so \u03b8=0 or 2\u03c0,\n\nbut varying \u03c6 gives the circle in the plane x = d+3 cos\u03b8 =8 +3(1)=11.\n\nWait, when \u03b8=0,\n\nx =d +3 cos\u03b8 =8 +3=11,\n\ny=3 sin\u03b8 cos\u03c6=0,\n\nz=3 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6=0,\n\nso that's just the point (11,0,0).\n\nHmm, that\u2019s a single point, not a circle. Contradiction. Therefore, my previous approach is flawed.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis using the parametrization gave the distance squared as d\u00b2 +6d cos\u03b8 +9,\n\nso when this equals 121 (the squared radius of the sphere),\n\nthen:\n\nd\u00b2 +6d cos\u03b8 +9 =121,\n\nwith d=8,\n\nthen 64 +48 cos\u03b8 +9=121,\n\nso 57 +48 cos\u03b8=121 \u2192 48 cos\u03b8=64 \u2192 cos\u03b8=64/48=4/3,\n\nwhich is impossible since cos\u03b8 can\u2019t exceed 1.\n\nWait, this contradicts the earlier conclusion. Where is the mistake?\n\nAh! Earlier when calculating the maximum distance squared as (d+3)^2,\n\nI assumed that the expression d\u00b2 +6d cos\u03b8 +9,\n\nwhich is correct,\n\nthen setting cos\u03b8=1 gives d\u00b2 +6d +9=(d+3)^2,\n\nbut when d=8,\n\nthen (8+3)^2=121,\n\nwhich is exactly the sphere's radius squared,\n\nso the maximum distance squared is 121,\n\nso the points achieving this are when cos\u03b8=1,\n\nwhich gives x=8+3*1=11,\n\nand y and z are determined by the torus equation.\n\nWait, but in the parametrization,\n\nwhen cos\u03b8=1,\n\nsin\u03b8=0,\n\nso y=0,\n\nz=0,\n\nso only the point (11,0,0).\n\nThus, the maximum distance is achieved at a single point, not a circle. This suggests that my previous assumption is wrong.\n\nHmm, this indicates that my analysis of maximum distance is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the circle of tangency occurs where the distance is 11, but not at the maximum point. Let me re-express the distance squared equation:\n\ndistance squared = d\u00b2 +6d cos\u03b8 +9.\n\nSetting this equal to 121,\n\nd\u00b2 +6d cos\u03b8 +9=121,\n\nso 6d cos\u03b8 =121 - d\u00b2 -9=112 -d\u00b2,\n\nso cos\u03b8=(112 -d\u00b2)/(6d).\n\nFor real solutions, |cos\u03b8| \u22641,\n\nso |112 -d\u00b2| \u22646d,\n\ni.e., -6d \u2264112 -d\u00b2 \u22646d,\n\nwhich implies:\n\nd\u00b2 -6d -112 \u22640 and d\u00b2 +6d -112 \u22650,\n\nWait, this is getting too involved. Maybe better to use the earlier approach with the plane.\n\nFor the internal tangent case with d=8,\n\nthe equation of the torus is:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + (x-8)^2 =9,\n\nand the sphere is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=121.\n\nWe can find the circle of intersection between them.\n\nLet me set s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2),\n\nthen the torus equation becomes:\n\n(s-6)^2 + (x-8)^2 =9,\n\nand the sphere equation gives s\u00b2 +x\u00b2=121.\n\nLet me solve these equations.\n\nExpand the torus equation:\n\ns\u00b2 -12s +36 +x\u00b2 -16x +64=9,\n\nCombine with sphere equation:\n\n(s\u00b2 +x\u00b2) =121,\n\nso substitute:\n\n121 -12s -16x +100=9,\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\ns\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -12s -16x +100 =9,\n\ns\u00b2 +x\u00b2 =121,\n\nso 121 -12s -16x +100 =9,\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in expansion.\n\nWait, expanding (s-6)^2 + (x-8)^2 =9:\n\ns\u00b2 -12s +36 +x\u00b2 -16x +64 =9,\n\nThus,\n\ns\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -12s -16x +100 =9,\n\nBut s\u00b2 +x\u00b2=121,\n\nso substitute 121 -12s -16x +100 =9,\n\nThus,\n\n-12s -16x =9 -121 -100 =-212,\n\nDivide both sides by -4:\n\n3s +4x=53,\n\nSo 3s +4x=53.\n\nNow, from sphere equation, s\u00b2 +x\u00b2=121,\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n3s +4x=53,\n\ns\u00b2 +x\u00b2=121,\n\nLet me solve for s from the first equation: s=(53 -4x)/3,\n\nSubstitute into second equation:\n\n[(53 -4x)/3]^2 +x\u00b2=121,\n\nExpand:\n\n(2809 -424x +16x\u00b2)/9 +x\u00b2 =121,\n\nMultiply all terms by 9:\n\n2809 -424x +16x\u00b2 +9x\u00b2=1089,\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n25x\u00b2 -424x +2809 -1089=0,\n\n25x\u00b2 -424x +1720=0,\n\nDivide by GCD (which is 1):\n\n25x\u00b2 -424x +1720=0,\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\nx=(424 \u00b1sqrt(424\u00b2 -4*25*1720))/(2*25),\n\nCalculate discriminant:\n\n424\u00b2= 424*424,\n\nLet me compute:\n\n400\u00b2=160000,\n\n24\u00b2=576,\n\nCross term 2*400*24=19200,\n\nThus, 424\u00b2= (400+24)^2=400\u00b2+2*400*24+24\u00b2=160000+19200+576=160000+19200=179200+576=179776.\n\n4*25*1720=100*1720=172000.\n\nThus discriminant is 179776 -172000=7776.\n\nsqrt(7776)= 88.2, but let me see:\n\n7776= 12^3 * 3^3? Wait, 7776 divided by 144=54, so sqrt(7776)=sqrt(144*54)=12*sqrt(54)=12*3*sqrt(6)=36\u221a6 \u224888.1816.\n\nThus,\n\nx=(424 \u00b136\u221a6)/50.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me see if there is a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since we are to find the radius of the circle of tangency, which lies in the plane where the two surfaces intersect. The radius can be found by finding the radius of the circle formed by their intersection.\n\nThe intersection of two spheres (or a sphere and a torus) generally is a circle, whose radius can be found via the distance between centers and radii.\n\nWait, but the torus is not a sphere. Alternatively, in the plane where the intersection occurs, the radius of the sphere's circle is sqrt(121 -x\u00b2), and the radius of the torus's circle is 6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (x -d)^2).\n\nFor internal tangent with d=8,\n\nthe equation we had earlier was sqrt(121 -x\u00b2)=6 + sqrt(9 - (x -8)^2),\n\nand we need to find x where this holds.\n\nAlternatively, the radius of the circle of tangency is the radius of the sphere's circle at that x, which is sqrt(121 -x\u00b2).\n\nAlternatively, the circle's radius is the same as the torus's circle's radius, which would be sqrt(121 -x\u00b2)=6 + sqrt(9 - (x -8)^2),\n\nand the actual radius of the circle (the radius in the plane) is sqrt(121 -x\u00b2).\n\nWait, but to find r_i, which is the radius of the circle along which they are tangent, it's the radius in the plane of the circle.\n\nAssuming the circle lies in a plane perpendicular to the x-axis at some x=k,\n\nthen the radius r_i is sqrt(121 -k\u00b2),\n\nand also,\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2)=6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - (k -8)^2),\n\nfor internal tangent, we take the plus sign:\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2)=6 + sqrt(9 - (k -8)^2).\n\nSolve for k,\n\nLet me set m=k-8,\n\nthen equation becomes sqrt(121 - (m+8)^2 )=6 + sqrt(9 -m\u00b2).\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n121 - (m+8)^2 =36 +12 sqrt(9 -m\u00b2) +9 -m\u00b2,\n\nExpand left side:\n\n121 - (m\u00b2 +16m +64)=121 -m\u00b2 -16m -64=57 -m\u00b2 -16m,\n\nRight side:\n\n36+9 +12 sqrt(9 -m\u00b2) -m\u00b2 =45 -m\u00b2 +12 sqrt(9 -m\u00b2),\n\nThus,\n\n57 -m\u00b2 -16m =45 -m\u00b2 +12 sqrt(9 -m\u00b2),\n\nCancel -m\u00b2,\n\n57 -16m =45 +12 sqrt(9 -m\u00b2),\n\nSubtract 45,\n\n12 -16m =12 sqrt(9 -m\u00b2),\n\nDivide both sides by 4,\n\n3 -4m =3 sqrt(9 -m\u00b2),\n\nSquare both sides,\n\n(3 -4m)^2 =9(9 -m\u00b2),\n\nExpand left side,\n\n9 -24m +16m\u00b2=81 -9m\u00b2,\n\nBring all terms to left,\n\n9-24m +16m\u00b2 -81 +9m\u00b2=0,\n\n25m\u00b2 -24m -72=0,\n\nSolve quadratic:\n\nm=(24 \u00b1sqrt(576 +4*25*72))/50,\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n576 +7200=7776,\n\nsqrt(7776)=88.1816\u224836\u221a6,\n\nThus,\n\nm=(24 \u00b136\u221a6)/50,\n\nHmm,\n\nSo,\n\nm=(24 +36\u221a6)/50 or (24-36\u221a6)/50,\n\nBut since sqrt(9 -m\u00b2) must be real,\n\n9 -m\u00b2\u22650 \u21d2 m\u00b2 \u22649,\n\nCheck the values:\n\nFirst solution m=(24 +36\u221a6)/50,\n\nApproximate sqrt(6)=2.449,\n\n36*2.449\u224888.16,\n\n24+88.16\u2248112.16,\n\ndivided by 50\u22482.243,\n\nm\u22482.243,\n\nthen m\u00b2\u22485>9?

Not a circle. Thus, my approach is wrong.\n\nTherefore, I must have misunderstood the problem's configuration.\n\nPerhaps the difference in radii is zero? But the problem states they are tangent along circles.\n\nThis suggests I need to revisit the problem's setup.\n\nThe problem states:\n\n\"Torus T is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let S be a sphere with a radius 11. When T rests on the inside of S, it is internally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_i, and when T rests on the outside of S, it is externally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_o. The difference r_i\u2212r_o can be written as m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m+n.\"\n\nPerhaps the key is that when resting on the inside or outside, the torus must be positioned such that the axis of the torus passes through the center of the sphere?\n\nAlternatively, the problem might require that the torus is placed such that the axis of revolution is along the line connecting the centers, and the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center is such that the tangency occurs along a circle.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nAssume the sphere is at the origin, and the torus's generating circle has its center at (d,0,0), axis of revolution is the y-axis (distance 6 from the center), so the center is at (6,0,0) if the axis is the y-axis. Wait, no, distance from (d,0,0) to the axis must be 6.\n\nIf the axis is the y-axis, then the center is at (d,0,0), so distance to the y-axis is |d|=6. Thus, center is at (6,0,0).\n\nThen the torus equation is (sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + y\u00b2 =9,\n\nsphere equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=121.\n\nTo find the circle of tangency when the torus rests inside the sphere.\n\nThe points of tangency must satisfy both equations and have parallel normals.\n\nEarlier, we derived the condition that x = (sd)/6,\n\nbut with d=6,\n\nWait, in this case d=6 (since the center is at (6,0,0)), so the previous steps can be re-examined.\n\nLet me set d=6,\n\nthen the equations become:\n\nTorus: (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x-6)^2=9,\n\nSphere: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=121.\n\nLet me use the same method as before.\n\nLet s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2),\n\nthen torus equation:\n\n(s -6)^2 + (x-6)^2=9,\n\nSphere equation: s\u00b2 +x\u00b2=121.\n\nExpand the torus equation:\n\ns\u00b2 -12s +36 +x\u00b2 -12x +36=9,\n\ns\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -12s -12x +72=9,\n\nUse sphere equation s\u00b2 +x\u00b2=121,\n\nThus,\n\n121 -12s -12x +72=9,\n\n-12s -12x=9 -193= -184,\n\nDivide by -12:\n\ns +x=184/12=46/3 \u224815.333,\n\nEquation 1: s +x=46/3,\n\nEquation 2: s\u00b2 +x\u00b2=121,\n\nLet me solve these equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: s=46/3 -x,\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n(46/3 -x)^2 +x\u00b2=121,\n\nExpand:\n\n(2116/9 - (92/3)x +x\u00b2) +x\u00b2=121,\n\n2116/9 -92x/3 +2x\u00b2=121,\n\nMultiply all terms by9:\n\n2116 -276x +18x\u00b2=1089,\n\n18x\u00b2 -276x +2116 -1089=0,\n\n18x\u00b2 -276x +1027=0,\n\nDivide by GCD (probably 1):\n\nDiscriminant D=276\u00b2 -4*18*1027,\n\n276\u00b2=76,176,\n\n4*18*1027=72*1027=74,264,\n\nD=76,176-74,264=1,912,\n\nsqrt(1912)= approx43.73,\n\nThus,\n\nx=(276\u00b1sqrt(1912))/36,\n\nThis is messy, but we can compute the radius of the circle of tangency.\n\nThe circle lies in the plane where the tangency occurs, which corresponds to a particular x value.\n\nThe radius in that plane is sqrt(121 -x\u00b2),\n\nand also according to the torus equation,\n\nthe radius of the torus's circle is s -6 (since in the plane x=k,\n\nthe torus's radius is sqrt( (sqrt(y\u00b2+z\u00b2)-6)^2 + (k-6)^2=9,\n\nbut in the plane x=k,\n\nthe equation is (sqrt(y\u00b2+z\u00b2)-6)^2 + (k-6)^2=9,\n\nso sqrt(y\u00b2+z\u00b2)=6 \u00b1sqrt(9 - (k-6)^2 ),\n\nso the radius is |6 \u00b1sqrt(9 - (k-6)^2)|,\n\nbut since internal tangent, we take the outer radius,\n\nso sqrt(121 -k\u00b2)=6 + sqrt(9 - (k-6)^2),\n\nLet me set k=x,\n\nthen,\n\nsqrt(121 -x\u00b2)=6 + sqrt(9 - (x-6)^2),\n\nSquare both sides,\n\n121 -x\u00b2 =36 +12sqrt(9 - (x-6)^2 ) +9 - (x-6)^2,\n\nSimplify:\n\n121 -x\u00b2 =45 +12sqrt(9 - (x-6)^2 ) -x\u00b2 +12x -36,\n\nWait,\n\nExpand (x-6)^2 =x\u00b2 -12x +36,\n\nso,\n\n121 -x\u00b2 =45 +12sqrt(9 -x\u00b2 +12x -36) -x\u00b2 +12x -36,\n\nWait,\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\nRight side after expanding:\n\n36 +9 - (x-6)^2 +12sqrt(9 - (x-6)^2 ),\n\n=45 - (x\u00b2 -12x +36) +12sqrt(9 - (x-6)^2 ),\n\n=45 -x\u00b2 +12x -36 +12sqrt(...),\n\n= (45-36) +12x -x\u00b2 +12sqrt(...),\n\n=9 +12x -x\u00b2 +12sqrt(9 - (x-6)^2 ),\n\nThus, equation becomes:\n\n121 -x\u00b2 =9+12x -x\u00b2 +12sqrt(9 - (x-6)^2 ),\n\nCancel -x\u00b2,\n\n121=9+12x +12sqrt(9 - (x-6)^2 ),\n\n112 -12x =12sqrt(9 - (x-6)^2 ),\n\nDivide by4,\n\n28 -3x =3sqrt(9 - (x-6)^2 ),\n\nSquare both sides,\n\n784 -168x +9x\u00b2=9*(9 - (x\u00b2-12x +36)),\n\nExpand right side:\n\n9*(9 -x\u00b2 +12x -36)=9*(-x\u00b2 +12x -27)= -9x\u00b2 +108x -243,\n\nThus,\n\n784 -168x +9x\u00b2= -9x\u00b2 +108x -243,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n784 -168x +9x\u00b2 +9x\u00b2 -108x +243=0,\n\n18x\u00b2 -276x +1027=0,\n\nWhich matches earlier equation.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. It's about a torus and a sphere, and figuring out the difference between two radii of tangency circles. Hmm, I need to visualize this first. \n\nFirst, let me recall what a torus is. A torus is like a donut shape, formed by rotating a circle around an axis in its plane. The problem says the torus T has a radius of 3 for the circle being revolved, and the distance from the center of that circle to the axis is 6. So, the major radius (distance from the center of the tube to the center of the torus) is 6, and the minor radius (radius of the tube itself) is 3. Got that.\n\nNow, the sphere S has radius 11. The problem mentions two scenarios: when the torus rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i, and when it's on the outside, it's externally tangent along a circle with radius r_o. We need to find r_i - r_o and express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me start with the first case: the torus inside the sphere. When they are internally tangent, their surfaces touch along a circle. Similarly, when the torus is on the outside of the sphere, they are externally tangent along another circle. \n\nI think I need to model both the torus and the sphere in a coordinate system to find the points of tangency. Let's set up coordinates. Let me consider the sphere S centered at the origin for simplicity. Then, the torus T must be positioned such that when it's inside the sphere, it touches the sphere along a circle. Similarly, when it's placed outside, the sphere and torus touch along another circle. \n\nWait, but how exactly is the torus positioned in each case? For internal tangency (inside the sphere), the center of the torus (the center of the generating circle's path) should be located somewhere inside the sphere. For external tangency, maybe the torus is outside the sphere, but still tangent? Hmm, maybe I need to consider the centers' positions relative to the sphere's center.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the axis of the torus is aligned with the axis of the sphere? Let me think. Since the problem mentions the torus is resting on the inside or outside, maybe the axis of the torus is along the same axis as the sphere's center? That might make sense for symmetry.\n\nLet me try to formalize this. Let's suppose the sphere S is centered at the origin (0,0,0). Then, the torus T, when resting inside S, would have its center (the center of the generating circle before revolution) along the axis of revolution, which we can take as the z-axis. Wait, actually, the axis of revolution for the torus is the axis around which the generating circle is rotated. So if the generating circle is in, say, the xy-plane with its center at (6, 0, 0), then revolving it around the z-axis (since the axis is in the plane of the circle, which is the xy-plane here) would create a torus centered at the origin? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, actually, the center of the generating circle is 6 units away from the axis. So if the axis is the z-axis, then the generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to the axis (the xy-plane) and centered at (6, 0, 0). So when you rotate that circle around the z-axis, the center of the torus as a whole is at the origin? Wait, no, the center of the torus is along the axis of revolution. Hmm, perhaps the center of the torus is at the origin if the axis is the z-axis, but the generating circle is offset by 6 units from the axis. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the center of the generating circle is 6 units from the axis. So for the torus, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6, which is called the major radius, and the minor radius is 3. \n\nNow, when the torus is inside the sphere of radius 11, how are they arranged? The sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is inside it. To have internal tangency along a circle, the closest points between the torus and the sphere would form a circle of radius r_i. Similarly, when the torus is outside, they are externally tangent, so the farthest points would form a circle of radius r_o. \n\nI need to find the radii r_i and r_o such that the torus is tangent to the sphere along those circles. Let me think of parametrizing the torus and sphere equations and set up the conditions for tangency.\n\nFirst, let's write the parametric equations for the torus. A standard parametrization for a torus centered at the origin with major radius R and minor radius r is:\n\nx = (R + r cos \u03b8) cos \u03c6\n\ny = (R + r cos \u03b8) sin \u03c6\n\nz = r sin \u03b8\n\nwhere \u03b8 and \u03c6 are angles parameterizing the surface. Wait, but in our case, the major radius (distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) is 6, so R = 6, and the minor radius (radius of the generating circle) is 3, so r = 3. So substituting R = 6 and r = 3:\n\nx = (6 + 3 cos \u03b8) cos \u03c6\n\ny = (6 + 3 cos \u03b8) sin \u03c6\n\nz = 3 sin \u03b8\n\nOkay, so that's the torus. Now the sphere S is centered at the origin with radius 11. The equation of the sphere is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 11\u00b2 = 121.\n\nNow, when the torus is resting inside the sphere and tangent to it, the closest points on the torus to the center (the origin) would form a circle, and the farthest points would form another circle? Wait, but tangency along a circle implies that the sphere and torus touch along that circle. So, for internal tangency, maybe the sphere is \"just touching\" the inner part of the torus? Hmm, perhaps the points of tangency would lie on a circle where the distance from the origin to those points is equal to the sphere's radius (11) and also lies on the torus. \n\nWait, but the sphere is fixed at radius 11, so when the torus is inside, the points where they are tangent must lie on both the torus and the sphere. So, those points must satisfy both equations. Additionally, the normals to the surfaces at those points must be colinear, which is the condition for tangency. \n\nHmm, this might get complicated. Let me see if there's a better way. Maybe using some geometric reasoning instead of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the distance from the center of the sphere (origin) to the center of the torus's generating circle. Wait, but the torus isn't a single point; its center is along the axis of revolution. Wait, maybe the axis of the torus is along the z-axis, so the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0) (before revolution). When revolved around the z-axis, the center of the torus is actually at the origin? Hmm, not exactly. The center of the torus as a surface is along the axis of revolution, which is the z-axis here, but the generating circle is offset by 6 units from that axis. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \"center\" of the torus is considered as the center of the axis, so the origin. Therefore, when the torus is inside the sphere, the distance from the origin to any point on the torus can vary. The closest points would be along the inner part of the torus, and the farthest points would be along the outer part. \n\nWait, let's think about the maximum and minimum distances from the origin to a point on the torus. The distance squared from the origin to a point on the torus can be calculated using the parametric equations. Let me compute that.\n\nUsing the parametrization above:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = [(6 + 3 cos \u03b8) cos \u03c6]^2 + [(6 + 3 cos \u03b8) sin \u03c6]^2 + (3 sin \u03b8)^2\n\nSimplify this:\n\n= (6 + 3 cos \u03b8)^2 (cos\u00b2 \u03c6 + sin\u00b2 \u03c6) + 9 sin\u00b2 \u03b8\n\nSince cos\u00b2 \u03c6 + sin\u00b2 \u03c6 = 1,\n\n= (6 + 3 cos \u03b8)^2 + 9 sin\u00b2 \u03b8\n\nExpanding (6 + 3 cos \u03b8)^2:\n\n= 36 + 36 cos \u03b8 + 9 cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + 9 sin\u00b2 \u03b8\n\nWait, hold on:\n\nWait, actually, expanding (6 + 3 cos \u03b8)^2 gives 36 + 36 cos \u03b8 + 9 cos\u00b2 \u03b8. Then adding the 9 sin\u00b2 \u03b8 term:\n\nTotal becomes 36 + 36 cos \u03b8 + 9 cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + 9 sin\u00b2 \u03b8\n\nBut cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8 = 1, so that's 36 + 36 cos \u03b8 + 9 (cos\u00b2 \u03b8 + sin\u00b2 \u03b8) = 36 + 36 cos \u03b8 + 9*1 = 36 + 36 cos \u03b8 +9 = 45 + 36 cos \u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the square of the distance from the origin to any point on the torus is 45 + 36 cos \u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the distance itself is sqrt(45 + 36 cos \u03b8).\n\nTherefore, the minimum and maximum distances from the origin to the torus occur when cos \u03b8 is minimized and maximized, since 45 + 36 cos \u03b8 is linear in cos \u03b8. Since cos \u03b8 ranges between -1 and 1, the minimum distance squared is 45 - 36 = 9, so distance 3, and maximum distance squared is 45 + 36 = 81, so distance 9. Wait, hold on, that can't be right. Wait, if the torus has a major radius of 6 (distance from center of generating circle to axis) and minor radius 3, then the inner radius (distance from origin to the closest point on the torus) would be 6 - 3 = 3, and the outer radius would be 6 + 3 = 9. So that matches. \n\nTherefore, the distance from the origin to the torus ranges from 3 to 9. But the sphere has a radius of 11, so when the torus is placed inside the sphere, they can touch internally when the sphere's surface coincides with the torus's outermost points? Wait, but the sphere's radius is 11, which is much larger. Wait, perhaps I need to adjust the position of the torus?\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I misunderstood the problem. The problem says \"when T rests on the inside of S, it is internally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_i\". So the torus is inside the sphere, and they are tangent along a circle. Similarly, when it's on the outside, they are externally tangent. \n\nBut in my previous calculation, the torus is centered at the origin, so the maximum distance from the origin to any point on the torus is 9, which is much less than the sphere's radius of 11. If the torus is centered at the origin, then the sphere of radius 11 would completely enclose the torus, but they wouldn't be tangent except maybe at points. But maybe the torus is shifted so that it touches the sphere?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem allows the torus to be positioned such that it is tangent to the sphere. Since the problem says \"when T rests on the inside of S\", maybe the torus is shifted towards the sphere's surface so that they are tangent. Similarly, when resting on the outside, it's placed outside the sphere but tangent. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the torus isn't centered at the origin but shifted in some direction so that they are tangent. Hmm, that complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the sphere and torus are both centered at the same point. But then, as I calculated before, the maximum distance from the origin to the torus is 9, so the sphere of radius 11 would just contain the torus without touching. To have tangency, the torus must be positioned such that its outer points touch the sphere. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the torus is not centered at the origin. Let me think again. \n\nSuppose the sphere is centered at the origin, and the torus is inside the sphere. To have internal tangency, the torus must be positioned such that the distance from the sphere's center (origin) to the torus's center (the center of the generating circle's path) is such that the outermost points of the torus touch the sphere. \n\nThe generating circle of the torus has radius 3, and the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6. Wait, maybe the \"center\" of the torus is along the axis of revolution, so if we denote the center as point C, then the distance from C to the sphere's center (origin) is some value, say d. \n\nLet me try to model this. Let me suppose that the axis of the torus is along the z-axis, so the center of the generating circle (before revolution) is at (d, 0, 0), and when revolved around the z-axis, the torus is centered along the z-axis. Wait, actually, the axis of revolution is the z-axis, so the center of the generating circle is at (R, 0, 0), where R is the major radius (6). Wait, but then the center of the generating circle is at (6, 0, 0). If the torus is to be inside the sphere of radius 11, then the distance from the origin to the farthest point on the torus would be 6 + 3 = 9, which is still less than 11. So, that suggests that if the torus is centered at the origin, it's entirely inside the sphere. But the problem says \"internally tangent\", so perhaps the torus is shifted so that it's just touching the sphere's inner surface. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the torus is placed such that its center (the center of the generating circle's path) is along the axis, and the distance from the sphere's center to the torus's center is adjusted so that the outer radius of the torus equals the sphere's radius. Wait, but that would require the outer radius of the torus to be 11. The outer radius of the torus is R + r = 6 + 3 = 9, which is less than 11, so that can't be. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that when the torus is resting on the inside of the sphere, the axis of the torus is along a radius of the sphere? \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to think in terms of the geometry of the two surfaces. When two surfaces are tangent along a circle, their centers and normals must satisfy some conditions. \n\nLet me recall that for two surfaces to be tangent along a circle, the circle must lie on both surfaces, and their normals at every point on the circle must be colinear. Let's try to use this.\n\nLet me consider the sphere S with equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 11\u00b2. The torus T is given by the equation (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)^2 + z\u00b2 = 3\u00b2. Wait, that's another way to write the torus equation. The standard equation for a torus with major radius R and minor radius r, centered at the origin, is (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - R)^2 + z\u00b2 = r\u00b2. So in this case, R = 6, so (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)^2 + z\u00b2 = 9.\n\nSo the sphere equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nWe need to find when these two surfaces are tangent along a circle, either internally or externally. \n\nLet me consider the case of internal tangency first. Internal tangent would mean that the torus is entirely inside the sphere except for the tangent circle. So the equations must have a common circle of solutions where their gradients are parallel.\n\nSimilarly for external tangent, which would be the case when the torus is outside the sphere, but I need to think how that works.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when they are externally tangent, the torus is outside the sphere, but positioned so that the sphere is inside the torus? Wait, but the sphere has a larger radius (11) than the torus's major radius (6). Wait, the sphere is bigger, so external tangent might mean that the torus is outside the sphere, but how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is using \"internally tangent\" and \"externally tangent\" in the sense of the orientation of the normals. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider the distance between centers. Let me denote the center of the sphere as O (origin), and the center of the torus's generating circle's path (the center along the axis) as point C. Since the torus is a surface, it doesn't have a single center, but its generating circle's center moves along a circle of radius 6 around the axis. Wait, perhaps the center of the torus's axis is at some point, but the problem might be considering the axis of the torus coinciding with the sphere's center?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem requires that the torus is placed such that the axis of the torus passes through the center of the sphere. Let me assume that the torus is arranged so that its axis is along the line connecting its center to the sphere's center. Wait, but the problem says \"when T rests on the inside of S\", so perhaps the torus is positioned such that its axis is aligned with the sphere's radius, so that the closest points are along that axis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the axis of the torus is along a radius of the sphere. Let me think of the torus as being \"placed\" inside the sphere such that it touches along a circle. Let me try to set up coordinates again with the sphere at the origin.\n\nSuppose the axis of the torus is along the z-axis. Then, the generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to the z-axis, say the xy-plane, centered at (6,0,0). The torus equation is (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)^2 + z\u00b2 = 9.\n\nThe sphere is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nTo find where they are tangent along a circle, we can set the equations equal. Let me see if there's a common circle.\n\nSuppose the circle of tangency lies in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis. Let me see. Let me suppose that the circle of tangency is in the plane z = 0. Let me check if that works.\n\nIn the plane z = 0, the sphere equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121. The torus equation becomes (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)^2 = 9. Let me solve this.\n\nLet me set r = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Then, (r - 6)^2 = 9 \u21d2 r - 6 = \u00b13 \u21d2 r = 9 or r = 3. \n\nSo in the plane z = 0, the torus intersects the sphere at r = 9 and r = 3. But the sphere's radius is 11, so r = 9 is within the sphere. Wait, but that might not necessarily be the tangent circle. \n\nWait, but if they are tangent along a circle, there should be only one solution for r. Hmm, so maybe the plane isn't z = 0. Alternatively, perhaps another plane where the equations have a single solution? \n\nAlternatively, the condition for tangency is that the two surfaces have a common tangent plane along the circle, so their normals must be colinear at every point on the circle. Let me try to compute the gradients.\n\nFor the sphere, the gradient (normal vector) at any point (x, y, z) is (2x, 2y, 2z). \n\nFor the torus, let's compute its gradient. The equation is (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)^2 + z\u00b2 - 9 = 0.\n\nLet me denote F(x,y,z) = (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)^2 + z\u00b2 - 9. The gradient \u2207F is:\n\nFirst, compute partial derivatives.\n\nLet me denote s = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). Then F = (s - 6)^2 + z\u00b2 -9.\n\nPartial derivative with respect to x:\n\ndF/dx = 2(s - 6)*( (x)/s ) + 0 + 0 = 2(s -6)(x/s)\n\nSimilarly, dF/dy = 2(s -6)(y/s)\n\nPartial derivative with respect to z is 2z.\n\nTherefore, the gradient is (2(s -6)(x/s), 2(s -6)(y/s), 2z)\n\nSo the gradient vectors for the sphere and torus must be colinear at the points of tangency. So, there exists a scalar \u03bb such that:\n\n(2x, 2y, 2z) = \u03bb*(2(s -6)(x/s), 2(s -6)(y/s), 2z)\n\nLet me simplify this equation component-wise.\n\nFirst, the x-component:\n\n2x = \u03bb * 2*(s -6)*(x)/s \u21d2 dividing both sides by 2:\n\nx = \u03bb*(s -6)*(x)/s\n\nSimilarly for the y-component:\n\ny = \u03bb*(s -6)*(y)/s\n\nAnd the z-component:\n\n2z = \u03bb * 2 z \u21d2 z = \u03bb z\n\nAssuming z \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by z:\n\n1 = \u03bb\n\nIf z = 0, then we have to handle that case separately.\n\nSo let's first consider z \u2260 0. Then \u03bb = 1. \n\nSubstituting back into the x-component equation:\n\nx = (s -6)*(x)/s \u21d2 x*(1 - (s -6)/s ) = 0\n\nSimilarly, for the y-component:\n\ny = (s -6)*(y)/s \u21d2 y*(1 - (s -6)/s ) = 0\n\nSo either x = 0 and y = 0, but that would mean the point is on the z-axis. However, s = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) would be zero, so s = 0. Plugging into the equation (s -6)^2 + z\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2 ( -6)^2 + z\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2 36 + z\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2 z\u00b2 = -27, which is impossible. Therefore, the only solution is that 1 - (s -6)/s = 0 \u21d2 1 = (s -6)/s \u21d2 s = s -6 \u21d2 0 = -6, which is a contradiction. \n\nHmm, that suggests that when z \u2260 0, the only solution would require s to satisfy an impossible equation, so no solution except when x and y are zero, which isn't possible. Therefore, the only possible points of tangency must have z = 0.\n\nSo let's consider z = 0. Then, the sphere equation gives x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121, and the torus equation gives (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 + 0 = 9 \u21d2 (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 = 9 \u21d2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6 = \u00b13 \u21d2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 9 or 3. \n\nBut the sphere has x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121 when z=0, so sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = sqrt(121) = 11. But 11 is not equal to 9 or 3, so there is no intersection in the plane z=0? Wait, that can't be. Wait, actually, if we set z=0, then the sphere's radius in that plane is 11, but the torus's intersection at z=0 would be two circles: one at radius 9 and another at 3. So those don't coincide with the sphere's radius of 11, so they don't intersect there. Hmm, so maybe the circle of tangency is in another plane?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the points of tangency are not at z=0. Wait, but according to the previous analysis, when z \u2260 0, we ended up with a contradiction unless x and y are zero, which is impossible. Therefore, the only possible points of tangency must lie where z=0, but there, the curves don't intersect? That suggests that maybe my assumption of the torus being centered at the origin is wrong?\n\nAh! Maybe the problem is that the torus is not centered at the origin. The problem says \"when T rests on the inside of S\", so perhaps the torus is shifted so that the distance between their centers is adjusted to allow tangency. \n\nLet me reorient. Let me denote the sphere is centered at the origin. Let me consider the torus as being centered at a point along the z-axis, say at (0,0,d). Wait, the axis of the torus is along the z-axis, so the center of the generating circle is at (R,0,0) where R is the major radius, but if we shift the torus's center, perhaps the center along the axis is displaced. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the axis of the torus is along the z-axis, but the entire torus is shifted upwards along the z-axis so that it touches the sphere. Wait, but then the axis is still the z-axis, so the generating circle's center would be at (6,0,0), but shifted along z? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the entire torus is shifted so that its center (the center of the generating circle's path) is at some point (a,0,0), so that the distance between the sphere's center (origin) and the torus's center is 'a', and the torus is arranged so that they are tangent. \n\nLet me try that approach. Let me suppose the torus is shifted along the x-axis so that its center (the center of the generating circle's path) is at (a,0,0). The axis of the torus is still the z-axis? Wait, if the center of the generating circle is at (a,0,0), then the axis of revolution would be the line perpendicular to the plane of the generating circle. Wait, the original problem says the axis is in the plane of the circle, a distance 6 from the center. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the setup again.\n\nThe problem states: \"Torus T is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle\". So the axis is in the plane of the generating circle, and 6 units away from the center. Therefore, when we revolve the circle around that axis, the resulting torus has major radius 6 and minor radius 3. \n\nTherefore, the standard parametrization of such a torus can be considered as follows: Let me set the generating circle in the xy-plane, centered at (6, 0, 0), and the axis of revolution is the y-axis? Wait, no, the axis is in the plane of the circle (the xy-plane here) and is 6 units from the center. Wait, perhaps the axis is the y-axis, and the generating circle is centered at (6,0,0). Therefore, when you rotate around the y-axis, the torus is formed. Wait, but rotating around the y-axis would make the major radius along the x-direction. Hmm, perhaps better to align it with coordinate axes.\n\nAlternatively, let me choose coordinates so that the axis of revolution is the z-axis, so the generating circle is in a plane perpendicular to the z-axis, say the xy-plane. The center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0), so the axis of revolution (the z-axis) is 6 units away from the center of the generating circle. So the major radius R is 6, minor radius r is 3. Then the equation of the torus is (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - 6)^2 + z\u00b2 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the center of the generating circle is (6,0,0), but when revolved around the z-axis, the torus is centered along the z-axis. Wait, but the distance from the origin to the generating circle's center is 6 units along the x-axis, so the torus as a whole is centered at the origin?\n\nWait, maybe the center of the torus's \"hole\" is at the origin. That is, the axis of revolution (the z-axis) is the central axis of the torus. Therefore, the center of the generating circle is 6 units away from the axis, so the torus has an inner radius of 6 - 3 = 3 and outer radius 6 + 3 = 9. \n\nTherefore, the torus is centered at the origin, with its \"hole\" along the z-axis. \n\nNow, the sphere is also centered at the origin with radius 11. \n\nWhen the problem says \"when T rests on the inside of S\", I think that means the torus is placed inside the sphere so that they are tangent along a circle. Since the torus is already centered at the origin, how would they be tangent? The torus's outer points are at 9 units from the origin, but the sphere has a radius of 11, so they don't reach. So unless the torus is moved so that its center is not at the origin. \n\nAh! Maybe the problem is that the torus is not centered at the origin. The problem says \"when T rests on the inside of S\", which might mean that the torus is placed so that it touches the sphere from the inside. To achieve tangency, the torus must be positioned such that the distance between their centers plus the torus's outer radius equals the sphere's radius, but since both are spheres, but the torus is a surface, perhaps the distance between centers must be such that the closest and farthest points correspond. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to model the torus offset from the sphere's center. Let me suppose that the sphere is at the origin, and the torus is shifted along the x-axis so that its center (the center of the generating circle's path) is at (d,0,0). So the generating circle is located at (d + 6, 0, 0) if the axis is along the x-axis? Wait, I need to be precise.\n\nWait, let me clarify the setup again. Let's suppose we have the sphere of radius 11 centered at the origin. The torus T is to be placed such that it is tangent to the sphere either internally or externally. To do this, we can consider the torus as being centered at some point relative to the sphere's center.\n\nLet me consider the general case where the torus has its axis along a line, and its center (the center of the generating circle's path) is located at a point distance 'a' from the sphere's center (origin). Let me assume the axis of the torus is along the x-axis for simplicity, so that the center of the generating circle is at (a, 0, 0). Wait, but the axis of the torus must be in the plane of the generating circle, which is 6 units from the center. Hmm, perhaps the axis is the x-axis, and the generating circle is in the plane containing the x-axis, centered at (6,0,0). Wait, maybe this is getting too confusing. Let me think of the torus's center as a point, and the distance between that point and the sphere's center as variable.\n\nAlternatively, let me model the problem by considering the distance between the centers of the sphere and the torus. Let me denote the center of the torus (the center of the generating circle's path) as point C located at a distance 'c' from the origin (sphere's center). \n\nThe torus is a surface where every point on it is at distance between (R - r) and (R + r) from the center C, where R is the major radius (6) and r the minor (3). Wait, actually, the distance from C to any point on the torus's surface would be between R - r and R + r? Wait, no, that's not exactly correct. The distance from the center of the generating circle (which is moving along a circle of radius R around the axis) to a point on the torus can vary. Hmm, perhaps better to use the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to use the concept of inversion or some geometric relationship. Alternatively, think of the circles of tangency.\n\nWait, here's an idea. For the torus and sphere to be tangent along a circle, that circle must lie on both surfaces, and the normals must agree. Since both are surfaces of revolution, maybe the circle of tangency lies in a plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution (which is the same as the sphere's center's line). Let me suppose the axis of the torus is along the line connecting the sphere's center to the torus's center. Let's set up coordinates so that the sphere is at the origin, and the torus's center is along the positive x-axis at (d,0,0). The axis of the torus is along the x-axis, so the generating circle is in a plane perpendicular to the x-axis, centered at (d + 6, 0,0), since the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis (the x-axis) is 6. Wait, no, the center of the generating circle is at (d,0,0), and the axis is the x-axis, so the distance from the center to the axis is 6, so the center must be 6 units away from the axis. Wait, perhaps my coordinate system is conflicting.\n\nLet me start over carefully.\n\nLet me set the sphere of radius 11 at the origin. Let me place the torus such that its axis of revolution is along the x-axis. The center of the generating circle (the circle being revolved) is at point (d, 0, 0). The axis of revolution is the x-axis, so the distance from the generating circle's center to the axis is the distance in the y-z plane, which must be 6. Since the generating circle is in a plane perpendicular to the x-axis (since the axis is along the x-axis), so the generating circle lies in a plane x = d, and its center is at (d, 0, 0). Therefore, the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis (the x-axis) is sqrt(0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2) = 0? Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps the axis is not along the x-axis.\n\nWait, according to the problem statement: \"the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle\". So the axis is in the plane of the circle and 6 units away from its center. Let me choose coordinates so that the generating circle lies in the xy-plane, with its center at (6,0,0), and the axis of revolution is the y-axis. Wait, the axis is in the plane (xy-plane) and 6 units from the center (6,0,0). So the axis must be a line in the xy-plane that is 6 units from (6,0,0). Let me choose the y-axis as the axis. Then the distance from (6,0,0) to the y-axis (x=0) is 6 units, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, revolving the circle centered at (6,0,0) with radius 3 around the y-axis gives the torus. \n\nTherefore, in this coordinate system:\n\n- The sphere is centered at the origin (0,0,0) with radius 11.\n\n- The torus is generated by revolving the circle in the xy-plane, center (6,0,0), radius 3, around the y-axis (the axis of revolution is the y-axis).\n\nTherefore, the equation of the torus can be derived as follows:\n\nConsider a point (x, y, z) on the torus. The generating circle (before revolution) is in the plane z=0, centered at (6,0,0) with radius 3. When revolved around the y-axis, each point (a, b, 0) on the generating circle traces a circle in the x-z plane. \n\nTo write the equation, let me recall that the distance from any point on the torus to the y-axis must be equal to the radius of the generating circle plus or minus the distance along the generating circle. Wait, perhaps better to use the standard torus equation.\n\nIn this setup, the major radius R is the distance from the generating circle's center to the axis (the y-axis), which is 6 units (along the x-axis). The minor radius r is 3. The axis of revolution is the y-axis. Therefore, the equation of the torus would be:\n\nFor any point (x, y, z), the distance from the point to the y-axis is sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). The generating circle is at x=6, so the distance from the center (6,0,0) to the y-axis is 6. Therefore, the equation is:\n\n(sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - 6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 3\u00b2.\n\nWait, let me verify. When revolving around the y-axis, the axis is y-axis, so the coordinates perpendicular to the axis (x and z) form a circle whose radius is sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). The generating circle is in the plane y=0, centered at (6,0,0). So for each point on the generating circle, its distance from the y-axis is 6 \u00b1 3 (since the circle has radius 3). Therefore, the equation would be (sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 9. Wait, but the z-coordinate is involved here. Hmm, actually, when rotating around the y-axis, the z-coordinate becomes part of the circular path. Hmm, perhaps my equation is correct.\n\nLet me check a point on the generating circle. Take the point (6 + 3, 0, 0) = (9,0,0). Plugging into the equation: (sqrt(9\u00b2 + 0) -6)^2 + 0 = (9 -6)^2 = 9, which equals 3\u00b2, so that works. Another point (6,0,0): (sqrt(36 +0) -6)^2 +0 = (6-6)^2 = 0, but that's the center of the generating circle, but since the radius is 3, that point is on the generating circle? Wait, no, the generating circle is centered at (6,0,0) with radius 3, so (6,0,0) is the center, not on the circle. So that point would be (sqrt(0 +0) -6)^2 + y\u00b2 = ( -6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 36 + y\u00b2. But the generating circle doesn't include that point. Hmm, perhaps I need to adjust the equation.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me derive the equation properly.\n\nLet me consider a point (X, Y, Z) on the torus. The generating circle is in the plane y = 0 (since we're revolving around the y-axis), and the generating circle has center (6, 0, 0) and radius 3. So, any point on the generating circle must satisfy (X -6)^2 + Z^2 = 3^2, and Y = 0 (since it's in the plane y=0 before revolution). \n\nWhen we revolve this around the y-axis, each point (X, 0, Z) on the generating circle will trace a circle in the X-Z plane with radius sqrt(X\u00b2 + Z\u00b2). Wait, no, actually, when rotating around the y-axis, the coordinates perpendicular to the y-axis (X and Z) will form a circle. The original point (X, 0, Z) will rotate such that the new coordinates (x, y, z) must satisfy:\n\nFor a fixed angle of rotation, the coordinates become (X cos \u03b8, Y, X sin \u03b8), but I need to be precise.\n\nWait, actually, rotating around the y-axis. Let me parametrize the generating circle as (6 + 3 cos \u03c6, 0, 3 sin \u03c6), where \u03c6 is the angle parameterizing the generating circle. \n\nWhen we rotate this point around the y-axis by an angle \u03b8, the new coordinates (x, y, z) become:\n\nx = (6 + 3 cos \u03c6) cos \u03b8\n\ny = 0 + 0 (since original Y is 0, and rotation around y-axis doesn't change y)\n\nWait, actually, rotating around the y-axis would keep y the same. Wait, but the original generating circle is at y=0, so after rotation, the y-coordinate remains 0? Wait no, that's not right. Wait, rotating around the y-axis would move the point in the x-z plane, so the y-coordinate stays the same. Since the generating circle is already in the y=0 plane, all points after rotation still have y-coordinate equal to their original y, which is zero. Wait that can't be. Wait, no: the generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation. Since the axis is the y-axis, the generating circle is in a plane perpendicular to y-axis, which is the x-z plane. Wait, no, the generating circle is in the plane y=0, which is perpendicular to the y-axis. So when we rotate around the y-axis, points on the generating circle will sweep out a torus where each point's y-coordinate is still 0? That can't be. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps better to use a different approach. Let me consider a general point on the generating circle: (6 + 3 cos \u03c6, 0, 3 sin \u03c6). When rotating this around the y-axis, each such point will form a circle in the x-z plane. The coordinates after rotation by angle \u03b8 would be:\n\nx = (6 + 3 cos \u03c6) cos \u03b8\n\ny = 0 (since the original y was 0, and rotation around y-axis doesn't change y)\n\nWait, that's not right. Wait, no, rotating around the y-axis, the y-coordinate remains the same, but the x and z coordinates rotate. So, if the original point is (a, b, c), rotating around y-axis gives (a cos \u03b8 - c sin \u03b8, b, a sin \u03b8 + c cos \u03b8). \n\nTherefore, applying this to the generating circle point (6 + 3 cos \u03c6, 0, 3 sin \u03c6):\n\nx = (6 + 3 cos \u03c6) cos \u03b8 - (3 sin \u03c6) sin \u03b8\n\ny = 0\n\nz = (6 + 3 cos \u03c6) sin \u03b8 + (3 sin \u03c6) cos \u03b8\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe it's better to write the equation in terms of coordinates.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the torus surface. Let me consider the distance from the y-axis (since the axis of revolution is the y-axis). The distance from any point (x, y, z) to the y-axis is sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). The generating circle is centered at (6, 0, 0), so the distance from the center to the y-axis is 6 (since the center is at x=6, z=0). The generating circle has radius 3, so the points on the generating circle are at a distance of 6 \u00b1 3 from the y-axis. But when rotated around the y-axis, the torus will have points where their distance to the y-axis varies between 3 and 9, but also their y-coordinate can vary. \n\nAlternatively, the equation of the torus can be written as:\n\nThe set of points where the distance from the y-axis is equal to 6 \u00b1 3 cos \u03c6, but I think the standard form is:\n\nThe equation of a torus with major radius R (distance from center to axis) and minor radius r, rotated around the y-axis, with its center at (R, 0, 0) is:\n\n(sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R)^2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2.\n\nAh! Yes, this is the standard equation. So in our case, R = 6, r = 3, so the equation is:\n\n(sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - 6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 9.\n\nTherefore, the sphere is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nNow, to find where they are tangent along a circle, we need to solve these equations simultaneously, and also have their normals colinear.\n\nLet me consider the case of internal tangent (torus inside sphere). The points of tangency must lie on both surfaces. Let me suppose that the circle of tangency lies in some plane perpendicular to the y-axis, say y = k. Because the problem has symmetry around the y-axis.\n\nLet me consider a plane y = k. In this plane, the sphere's equation becomes x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121 - k\u00b2, and the torus's equation becomes (sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + k\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2 (sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 = 9 - k\u00b2 \u21d2 sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = 6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - k\u00b2). \n\nFor real solutions, we need 9 - k\u00b2 \u2265 0 \u21d2 |k| \u2264 3.\n\nTherefore, in the plane y=k, the torus intersects the sphere where sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) equals 6 \u00b1 sqrt(9 - k\u00b2), and also sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = sqrt(121 - k\u00b2). \n\nTherefore, setting equal:\n\nEither sqrt(121 -k\u00b2) = 6 + sqrt(9 -k\u00b2) or sqrt(121 -k\u00b2) = 6 - sqrt(9 -k\u00b2)\n\nLet me consider the first equation:\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2) = 6 + sqrt(9 -k\u00b2)\n\nLet me square both sides:\n\n121 -k\u00b2 = 36 + 12 sqrt(9 -k\u00b2) + 9 -k\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n121 -k\u00b2 = 45 + 12 sqrt(9 -k\u00b2) -k\u00b2\n\nCancel -k\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n121 = 45 + 12 sqrt(9 -k\u00b2)\n\nSubtract 45:\n\n76 = 12 sqrt(9 -k\u00b2)\n\nDivide by 12:\n\n76/12 = sqrt(9 -k\u00b2)\n\nSimplify 76/12 = 19/3 \u2248 6.333, but sqrt(9 -k\u00b2) must be real and non-negative. However sqrt(9 -k\u00b2) is at most 3, so 19/3 \u22486.333 >3, which is impossible. Therefore, this equation has no solution.\n\nNow the second equation:\n\nsqrt(121 -k\u00b2) = 6 - sqrt(9 -k\u00b2)\n\nAgain, square both sides:\n\n121 -k\u00b2 = 36 -12 sqrt(9 -k\u00b2) + 9 -k\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n121 -k\u00b2 = 45 -12 sqrt(9 -k\u00b2) -k\u00b2\n\nCancel -k\u00b2:\n\n121 = 45 -12 sqrt(9 -k\u00b2)\n\nSubtract 45:\n\n76 = -12 sqrt(9 -k\u00b2)\n\nBut sqrt(9 -k\u00b2) is non-negative, so RHS is non-positive, but LHS is 76, so no solution.\n\nHmm, so in the plane y=k, there is no solution where the sphere and torus meet, unless I messed up the equations. \n\nWait, this suggests that there is no intersection? But that can't be. Maybe my assumption of the plane being perpendicular to the y-axis is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the circle of tangency is in another orientation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the circle of tangency is not in a plane perpendicular to the y-axis. Since the sphere and torus are both surfaces of revolution around the y-axis, their intersection should also be a curve of revolution, hence a circle in a plane perpendicular to the y-axis. Therefore, there must be a solution somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the error is in the equation setup. Let me recheck.\n\nThe equation of the torus is (sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 9.\n\nThe sphere is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nLet me denote s = sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Then, the torus equation becomes (s -6)^2 + y\u00b2 =9, and the sphere equation is s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121.\n\nLet me subtract the torus equation from the sphere equation:\n\n(s\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - [(s -6)^2 + y\u00b2] = 121 -9 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - (s\u00b2 -12s +36) = 112 \u21d2 12s -36 =112 \u21d2 12s = 148 \u21d2 s = 148/12 = 37/3 \u224812.333...\n\nTherefore, s = 37/3. Since s = sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2), this gives x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (37/3)^2 = 1369/9.\n\nThen substituting back into the sphere equation: s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121 \u21d2 y\u00b2 = 121 - 1369/9 = (1089 -1369)/9 = (-280)/9. \n\nWait, that's impossible. Negative value? That can't be. Hmm, so what's wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps this approach is wrong. Let me see. The equations:\n\nSphere: s\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 121\n\nTorus: (s -6)^2 + y\u00b2 =9\n\nSubtracting torus equation from sphere equation gives:\n\ns\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(s -6)^2 + y\u00b2] = 121 -9 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - (s\u00b2 -12s +36) = 112 \u21d2 12s -36 = 112 \u21d2 12s = 148 \u21d2 s = 148/12 = 37/3. \n\nBut then substituting s = 37/3 into the torus equation:\n\n(37/3 -6)^2 + y\u00b2 =9 \u21d2 (37/3 -18/3)^2 + y\u00b2 = (19/3)^2 + y\u00b2 = 361/9 + y\u00b2 =9 \u21d2 y\u00b2= 9 - 361/9 = (81 -361)/9 = -280/9. \n\nNegative again. So this suggests that there is no real intersection between the sphere and torus when the torus is centered at the origin? But that contradicts intuition, since the sphere is radius 11 and the torus's outer radius is 9, so the torus is entirely inside the sphere. \n\nTherefore, there is no intersection? But the problem states that they are tangent along a circle. So there must be a different setup.\n\nAh! Here's the mistake: I assumed the torus is centered at the origin, but in the problem, when it says \"when T rests on the inside of S\", the torus must be positioned such that it touches the sphere. Therefore, the torus cannot be centered at the origin because then it would be entirely inside the sphere without touching. Therefore, we have to shift the torus so that it is tangent to the sphere. \n\nTherefore, the center of the torus (the center of the generating circle's path) must be offset from the sphere's center (origin) such that the distance from the origin to the torus's farthest point equals the sphere's radius. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let's denote the center of the torus's generating circle (before revolution) is at a point C located at distance 'd' from the origin. The axis of the torus is the line along which it is revolved, which is in the plane of the generating circle and 6 units away from its center. \n\nTo simplify, let me choose coordinates such that the axis of the torus is along the y-axis, and the center of the generating circle is at (d, 0, 0), so the distance from the center to the axis (y-axis) is d units along the x-axis. Wait, but the problem states that the distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis is 6. So in this coordinate system, the distance from (d,0,0) to the y-axis (the axis of revolution) must be 6. The distance from a point (d,0,0) to the y-axis is |d|, so we have d = \u00b16. But then the center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0) or (-6,0,0). Wait, but then the distance from the sphere's center (origin) to the torus's center (generating circle's center) is 6 units. \n\nWait, if we want to shift the torus such that it touches the sphere, we might have to move its center further. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center (the center of the generating circle's path). Let me denote the distance between the sphere's center (origin) and the torus's center (C) as 'a'. \n\nThe torus has a major radius R = 6 (distance from generating circle's center to its axis) and minor radius r = 3. \n\nThe maximum distance from the origin to any point on the torus would be a + R + r = a + 6 + 3 = a + 9.\n\nThe minimum distance is a - (R + r) = a - 9.\n\nWait, is that correct? The maximum distance from the origin to the torus would be the distance from the origin to the center of the generating circle (a) plus the maximum distance from the generating circle's center to any point on the torus (which is R + r = 6 +3 =9). Similarly, the minimum would be a -9. \n\nWait, actually, the maximum distance would be a + sqrt(R\u00b2 + r\u00b2)? Hmm, perhaps I need to think in terms of vectors.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the center of the generating circle is at distance 'a' from the origin. The torus's points can be at most a + (R + r) away, and at least a - (R + r). But actually, R is the distance from the generating circle's center to the axis, so the generating circle's center is offset by R from the axis. \n\nWait, perhaps an example: if the torus is centered at (a, 0, 0), then the farthest point on the torus from the origin would be along the line connecting the origin to (a,0,0), so in the direction away from the origin. The maximum distance would be a + (R + r) = a + 9. Similarly, the minimum distance would be a - 9. \n\nTherefore, to have the torus tangent to the sphere of radius 11 internally, the maximum distance from the origin to the torus must equal the sphere's radius. Wait, but internal tangent would mean the torus is inside the sphere, so the farthest point of the torus touches the sphere. Therefore:\n\na + 9 = 11 \u21d2 a = 2.\n\nSimilarly, for external tangent, the closest point of the torus to the sphere's center would be equal to the sphere's radius? Wait, no, external tangent would mean the torus is outside the sphere, so the closest distance from the torus to the origin is equal to the sphere's radius.\n\nWait, but the sphere has radius 11. If the torus is externally tangent, that might mean the closest point on the torus to the origin is 11 units away, so:\n\na - 9 = 11 \u21d2 a = 20.\n\nTherefore, the difference in radii r_i and r_o can be found based on the positions when a =2 and a=20.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the torus rests on the inside or outside of S. So perhaps when resting inside, the center is at a =2, and outside at a=20. \n\nBut how does this relate to the radii r_i and r_o of the circles of tangency?\n\nThe circles of tangency would be the set of points where the torus and sphere are tangent. Since both are surfaces of revolution around the y-axis, the circle of tangency would lie in a plane perpendicular to the axis of revolution (the y-axis), which is the x-z plane. \n\nIn the case of internal tangency (a=2), the point of farthest distance is 11 units from the origin, which is on the sphere. The circle of tangency would be all points on the torus that are at distance 11 from the origin, lying in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers (the y-axis). Wait, actually, since the axis is the y-axis, the line connecting the centers is along the x-axis (from origin to (a,0,0)). Hmm, maybe the plane of the circle is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers? \n\nAlternatively, since both are symmetric about the y-axis, the circle of tangency should lie in a plane perpendicular to the x-axis (since the centers are along the x-axis). So, in the plane perpendicular to x at some point. Wait, perhaps the circle lies in the plane where the distance from the origin is maximized/minimized.\n\nWait, in the case of internal tangent (a=2), the farthest point on the torus from the origin is 11, so the circle of tangency is the set of points on the torus at distance 11 from the origin. \n\nLet me compute the radius of this circle. \n\nLet me consider the torus with center at (a,0,0) where a=2. The equation of the torus is:\n\n(sqrt(x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + y\u00b2 = 9. Wait, but if the center is at (2,0,0), then the equation would be different. Wait, hold on, earlier equations assumed the center of the generating circle is at (6,0,0). If we move the center to (a,0,0), the equation must change. \n\nAh! Here's the mistake again. The previous equations assumed the center was at (6,0,0). If we shift the torus so its center is at (a,0,0), then the equation changes. Let me rederive the equation with a general center.\n\nLet me denote the center of the generating circle as (a,0,0). The axis of revolution is the y-axis, so the distance from the generating circle's center to the axis is |a|, but according to the problem, this distance should be 6. Therefore, |a| must be 6. Wait, that's a problem. Because in the problem statement, the distance from the generating circle's center to the axis is fixed at 6. Therefore, the center of the generating circle must be 6 units from the axis, so if the axis is the y-axis, then the center must be at (\u00b16, 0, 0). Therefore, we can't choose 'a' arbitrarily; it must be 6. \n\nWait, this is a key point! The problem says the torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis in its plane that is 6 units from the center. Therefore, the distance between the generating circle's center and the axis must always be 6. Therefore, if we choose the axis as the y-axis, the center of the generating circle must be 6 units away from the y-axis, i.e., at (6,0,0) or (-6,0,0). Therefore, the center cannot be moved closer or farther from the origin; it must stay 6 units from the axis. \n\nTherefore, the distance from the origin to the generating circle's center (a,0,0) is 'a', but to maintain the axis distance, a must be 6. So the center of the generating circle is fixed at (6,0,0) if the axis is the y-axis. Hence, the torus is always centered at (6,0,0) with respect to the axis. \n\nTherefore, the previous assumption that we could shift the torus's center is incorrect because the problem defines the torus with fixed geometry. The torus's geometry is fixed with major radius 6 and minor 3. Therefore, its center (generating circle's center) is fixed at 6 units from the axis, but the position of the torus relative to the sphere can be altered by moving the entire torus. \n\nWait, but the axis must be in the plane of the generating circle. If we move the torus such that its generating circle's center is at a different location, then the axis must also move accordingly to stay 6 units away. \n\nWait, perhaps the axis can be moved. Let me consider that the entire torus can be positioned anywhere in space, as long as its generating circle's center is 6 units from its axis. To have the torus rest inside or outside the sphere, we can translate the torus so that the distance between the sphere's center and the torus's center (generating circle's center) is adjusted. \n\nLet me formalize this. Let me denote the center of the generating circle as point C, located at a distance 'd' from the sphere's center (origin). The axis of the torus is a line in the plane of the generating circle, 6 units away from C. To achieve tangency, we need to find 'd' such that the torus touches the sphere along a circle. \n\nThe maximum distance from the origin to the torus is the distance from the origin to C plus the maximum distance from C to the torus's surface. The maximum distance from C to the torus's surface is the major radius plus minor radius? \n\nWait, the torus's surface points are at a distance from C: the generating circle has radius 3, so the points on the torus are at most 3 units away from the generating circle's path, which itself is a circle of radius 6 around the axis. Wait, this is getting too vague. \n\nPerhaps using the equation approach again, but allowing the center to be at (d,0,0). Let me try that.\n\nLet me redefine the torus with its generating circle center at (d,0,0), and the axis of revolution is the line parallel to the y-axis but offset? Wait, no, the axis must be in the plane of the generating circle, which is the xy-plane here, and 6 units from the center. \n\nLet me define the axis as the line x = d -6, y =0, z =0 (so along the x-axis, offset by 6 units from the generating circle's center at (d,0,0)). Then, revolving the circle centered at (d,0,0) with radius 3 around the axis x = d -6, y=0, z=0 (which is parallel to the x-axis but offset? No, actually, the axis is a line in the plane of the generating circle (xy-plane) that is 6 units away from the center. \n\nLet me choose coordinates so that the axis is the line y=0, z=0, x= d -6. Wait, this is getting too complex. Maybe better to use vector distance.\n\nThe distance from any point on the torus to the axis must be equal to the minor radius? Wait, no. Let me try to write the equation of the torus when its center is at (d,0,0) and the axis is the line through (d-6,0,0) parallel to the y-axis. Hmm, this is getting too involved. \n\nPerhaps another approach using the concept of inversion or geometric relations. \n\nLet me think of the torus as a surface with two radii: the major radius (distance from the center of the generating circle to the axis) R =6, and minor radius r=3. The sphere has radius 11.\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere and tangent, the distance between the centers (sphere at origin, torus's generating circle center at point C) should satisfy some condition. Let me denote the distance between the centers as 'a'. \n\nThe closest distance from the sphere's center to the torus is a - (R + r) = a - 9, and the farthest is a + 9. \n\nFor internal tangency (torus inside sphere), the farthest point of the torus must touch the sphere, so:\n\na + 9 = 11 \u21d2 a = 2.\n\nFor external tangency (torus outside sphere), the closest point must touch the sphere, so:\n\na - 9 = 11 \u21d2 a = 20.\n\nTherefore, the centers are separated by 2 and 20 units respectively. \n\nNow, to find the radii r_i and r_o of the circles of tangency. \n\nThe circle of tangency lies in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the two centers (the sphere's center and the torus's center). Since the torus is symmetric, the line connecting the centers is along the x-axis (assuming the torus's center is along the x-axis). Therefore, the plane of tangency is perpendicular to the x-axis, so it's the plane x = constant. \n\nLet me consider the internal tangent case first (a =2). The point of tangency is the farthest point from the origin on the torus, which is along the line connecting the two centers. So the point is in the direction away from the sphere's center, so at (a + (R + r), 0, 0) = (2 +9, 0,0)= (11,0,0), which is on the sphere. \n\nHowever, the circle of tangency is not just a single point, but all points on the torus that are farthest from the origin. Since the torus is a surface of revolution, the set of farthest points forms a circle in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers. \n\nWait, in this case, the farthest points from the origin on the torus would lie in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the origin to the torus's center (which is along the x-axis). The plane perpendicular to the x-axis at x =11 (but that's just a point). Wait, no, the farthest points would actually form a circle in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers at the point of farthest distance. \n\nWait, perhaps better to use coordinates. Let me set the sphere's center at the origin, and the torus's generating circle center at (a,0,0) where a =2 for internal tangent. \n\nThe equation of the torus in this case would be:\n\nThe axis of the torus is 6 units from its generating circle's center, which is at (2,0,0). So the axis is the line x =2-6= -4, y=0, z=0 (since the axis must be in the plane of the generating circle (xy-plane) and 6 units from (2,0,0)). So the axis is the line x = -4, y=0, z=0 (along the x-axis). \n\nTherefore, the equation of the torus is:\n\nFor any point (x,y,z), the distance to the axis (x=-4, y=0, z=0) is sqrt( (x +4)^2 + y^2 + z^2 ). Wait, no, the axis is a line, so the distance from a point to the axis needs to be computed properly. \n\nThe axis is the x-axis line at x=-4, y=0, z=0. The distance from a point (x,y,z) to this axis is sqrt( (y)^2 + (z)^2 + (x +4)^2 - ( (x +4) * 0 + y*0 + z*0 )^2 )? No, the distance from a point to a line in 3D can be computed via the formula. \n\nThe axis is the line parameterized as (-4, 0, 0) + t(1,0,0), wait no, if it's along the x-axis at x=-4, then it's the line where y=0, z=0, x =-4 + t*0? Wait, no. Wait, the axis is a line in the plane of the generating circle. If the generating circle is centered at (2,0,0), then the axis is in the xy-plane, 6 units away from (2,0,0). Let me compute the axis line properly.\n\nThe axis must be a line in the xy-plane (since the generating circle is in the xy-plane) that is 6 units away from (2,0,0). Let me choose the axis to be the line x = -4, y=0 (since distance from (2,0) to x=-4 is 6 units along the x-axis). Therefore, the axis is the line x = -4, y=0, z=0. This is a straight line along the x-axis at x=-4, extending infinitely in both z directions but here constrained to the xy-plane.\n\nThen, the torus is formed by rotating the generating circle (center (2,0,0), radius 3) around the axis x=-4, y=0, z=0. \n\nThe distance from any point on the generating circle to the axis is sqrt( ( (2 - (-4))^2 + 0^2 +0^2 ) - (along the axis direction) ?\n\nWait, perhaps parametrize the torus. A point on the generating circle is (2 + 3 cos\u03b8, 0, 3 sin\u03b8). When revolved around the axis x=-4, y=0, z=0, the coordinates become? \n\nHmm, this is getting too complex. Let me instead use the general equation for a torus with center offset.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is symmetric, maybe the radius of the circle of tangency can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers. \n\nWhen two surfaces are tangent along a circle, the radius of the circle can be found by considering the distance from the center of the circle to the line connecting the centers of the two surfaces. \n\nLet me denote the distance between the centers as 'a' (2 for internal, 20 for external). The radius of the circle of tangency r is given by r = sqrt( R^2 - (a - d)^2 ), where d is something. \n\nWait, here's an idea. In the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers (the x-axis in our setup), the circle of tangency has a radius that can be found by considering the intersection. \n\nIn the internal tangent case (a =2):\n\nThe sphere has radius 11, the torus's center is at (2,0,0). The farthest point on the torus from the origin is (11,0,0). The circle of tangency is the set of points on the torus at distance 11 from the origin. \n\nTo find the radius of this circle, consider a cross-section in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers (the x-axis). That plane would be the y-z plane at x =11, but that point is just a single point. Wait, perhaps in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers, which is the y-z plane. \n\nWait, actually, the circle of tangency lies in a plane that is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the two surfaces (sphere and torus). Since the sphere's center is at (0,0,0) and the torus's center is at (a,0,0), the line connecting them is along the x-axis. Therefore, the plane perpendicular to this line is the y-z plane. The intersection of this plane with the torus and sphere will give the circle of tangency. \n\nIn the internal tangent case (a=2):\n\nThe sphere's equation in the y-z plane (x=0) would be y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121, but the plane is actually where x is varying? Wait, no. The plane perpendicular to the x-axis is the y-z plane at a fixed x-coordinate. \n\nThe circle of tangency must lie in the plane where the distance from the origin is maximized for the torus. Since the farthest point is at x=11 (on the positive x-axis), the plane perpendicular to the x-axis at x=11 contains only that point. Hence, the circle must lie in another plane.\n\nAlternatively, the circle of tangency is not along the line of centers but in a plane perpendicular to it at some point. Let me think again.\n\nLet me consider the sphere and torus equations with the torus's center at (a,0,0). \n\nThe sphere is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nThe torus, with generating circle center at (a,0,0) and major radius 6 (distance from generating circle to axis is 6), so the axis is located at (a -6, 0,0). The equation of the torus can be written as follows:\n\nThe axis is the line x = a -6, y=0, z=0. The distance from any point (x,y,z) to this axis is sqrt( (x - (a -6))\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 ) projected onto the plane perpendicular to the axis. Wait, no, the distance from a point to the axis (a line) is calculated by:\n\nFor a line defined by a point P0 and direction vector v, the distance from a point P to the line is |(P - P0) \u00d7 v| / |v|.\n\nIn our case, the axis is the line along x = a -6, y=0, z=0 (so direction vector along x-axis). A point on the axis is (a -6,0,0), and direction vector is (1,0,0). \n\nThe distance from a point (x,y,z) to the axis is sqrt( y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + (x - (a -6))^2 - ( (x - (a -6)) *1 )^2 )? Wait, no, the cross product formula:\n\nLet me compute it properly. \n\nLet the axis be the line L: (a -6, 0,0) + t(1,0,0). \n\nA point P(x,y,z). The vector from P0 to P is (x - (a-6), y, z). The direction vector of the axis is v = (1,0,0). \n\nThe cross product (P - P0) \u00d7 v is determinant:\n\n|i\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0j\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0k|\n|x - (a-6)\u00a0y\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0z|\n|1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a00|\n\n= i*(y*0 - z*0) - j*( (x - (a-6))*0 - z*1 ) + k*( (x - (a-6))*0 - y*1 )\n\n= 0i - (-z)j + (-y)k = z j - y k\n\nThe magnitude squared of this cross product is z\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nThe distance is |(P - P0) \u00d7 v| / |v| = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/1 = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2).\n\nSo the distance from point P to the axis is sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2).\n\nThe torus equation is then the set of points where this distance is equal to the minor radius (3), but offset by the major radius (6). Wait, the generating circle has a radius of 3, so the distance from the generating circle's center (a,0,0) to the axis is 6 units. \n\nWait, the generating circle is centered at (a,0,0), so the distance from that point to the axis (which is at x =a-6) is exactly 6 units. \n\nThe torus consists of all points whose distance to the axis is 3 (minor radius), but their position along the axis is determined by the generating circle. \n\nWait, perhaps the equation of the torus is:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - 3 )^2 + (x - (a -6))^2 = 6\u00b2 ?\n\nHmm, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nThe generating circle is in the plane perpendicular to the axis (the axis is along the x-direction here). The generating circle is centered at (a,0,0), which is 6 units away from the axis (x=a-6). The generating circle has a radius of 3, so points on the generating circle satisfy (x - a)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3\u00b2. But since it's in the plane perpendicular to the axis (the axis direction is x), the generating circle is in the plane x = a. Wait, no, the axis is along the x-axis direction at x = a-6, so the generating circle is in a plane perpendicular to the axis direction (the x-axis), which is the y-z plane at x = a. \n\nTherefore, the generating circle is defined by x = a, and (y)^2 + (z)^2 = 3\u00b2, centered at (a,0,0). \n\nWhen we rotate this circle around the axis (the line x = a-6, y=0, z=0 along the x-axis), the resulting torus's equation can be derived as follows:\n\nFor any point on the torus, the distance from the axis (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)) must be equal to the minor radius (3) plus or minus the component along the axis. Wait, perhaps better to use coordinates.\n\nParametrizing the torus: take a point on the generating circle (a, 3 cos\u03b8, 3 sin\u03b8). Rotating this around the axis (the x-axis line at x = a-6). \n\nWait, rotating around the axis which is the x-axis line through (a-6,0,0). The rotation is around the x-axis line shifted to x=a-6. \n\nThis is complicated, but perhaps the equation can be expressed as:\n\nThe distance along the axis direction from the generating circle's center to the axis is 6 units. Therefore, the torus equation can be written as:\n\n( sqrt( (x - (a -6))^2 + y^2 + z^2 ) - 6 )^2 + (x - a)^2 = 3^2 ?\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe better to use the general formula for a torus.\n\nThe standard equation for a torus with major radius R, minor radius r, centered at (h,0,0) along the x-axis, and with the axis along the x-axis is:\n\n( sqrt( (x - h)^2 + y^2 + z^2 ) - R )^2 + (y^2 + z^2 ) = r^2 ?\n\nNo, that doesn't seem right. \n\nAlternatively, the equation when the axis is along the line x = a -6, y=0, z=0 (the x-axis shifted):\n\nThe equation would be:\n\nFor any point (x,y,z), the distance to the axis (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)) forms a circle with radius r=3, but offset along the axis direction by R=6 from the generating circle's center. \n\nWait, the generating circle is at x = a, which is R=6 units away from the axis at x=a-6. So the distance along the axis from the axis to the generating circle's center is 6. \n\nTherefore, the equation of the torus would be:\n\n( sqrt( (x - (a -6))^2 ) - 6 )^2 + (y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) = 3\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nLet me denote the distance along the axis direction from the axis to the point as (x - (a -6)). The generating circle is located at x = a, which is 6 units from the axis. The points on the torus are those where their distance from the generating circle's center (a,0,0) is 3, but rotated around the axis. \n\nThis is getting too tangled. Perhaps it's better to consider the cross-section.\n\nIn the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers (the x-axis), which is the y-z plane, the sphere's cross-section is a circle of radius sqrt(121 -x\u00b2), and the torus's cross-section is a circle of radius 3, centered at (a,0,0) projected onto this plane, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, when the surfaces are tangent, the circle of tangency lies in a plane where the distance from the origin is such that the sphere and torus equations have a common solution with matching normals.\n\nLet me try this approach again with the shifted torus.\n\nLet me assume the torus's center (generating circle center) is at (a,0,0). The sphere is at (0,0,0). The distance between centers is 'a'. The torus's equation is:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - 6 )^2 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 = 3\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, perhaps the equation is similar to the standard torus equation but shifted. Let me think again.\n\nThe standard torus equation with major radius R, minor radius r, and axis along the x-axis is:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R )\u00b2 + (x)^2 = r\u00b2.\n\nBut that's when the center is at the origin. If the torus is shifted so its generating circle's center is at (a,0,0), then the axis is at (a - R, 0,0). Therefore, the equation would be:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - R )\u00b2 + (x - (a - R))\u00b2 = r\u00b2.\n\nIn our case, R = 6, r =3, and the generating circle's center is at (a,0,0). So the equation is:\n\n( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 = 9.\n\nThe sphere equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nTo find the circle of tangency, set these equations equal and solve for the condition that their gradients are colinear.\n\nLet me set up the equations:\n\n1) ( sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6 )\u00b2 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 = 9,\n\n2) x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 121.\n\nLet me denote s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Then equation 1 becomes:\n\n(s -6)^2 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 =9,\n\nand equation 2 is x\u00b2 + s\u00b2 = 121.\n\nLet me subtract equation 1 from equation 2:\n\nx\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - [ (s -6)^2 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 ] = 121 -9 \u21d2\n\nExpand (s -6)^2 = s\u00b2 -12s +36,\n\nand (x - (a -6))\u00b2 = x\u00b2 - 2x(a -6) + (a -6)^2.\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + s\u00b2 - [ s\u00b2 -12s +36 + x\u00b2 - 2x(a -6) + (a -6)^2 ] = 112 \u21d2\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nx\u00b2 cancels with -x\u00b2,\n\ns\u00b2 cancels with -s\u00b2,\n\nLeaving:\n\n- [ -12s +36 -2x(a -6) + (a -6)^2 ] =112 \u21d2\n\n12s -36 + 2x(a -6) - (a -6)^2 =112 \u21d2\n\n12s + 2x(a -6) = 112 +36 + (a -6)^2 \u21d2\n\n12s + 2x(a -6) = (a -6)^2 + 148.\n\nHmm, this is still complicated. \n\nPerhaps instead of this, let's consider the condition for tangency. At the point of tangency, the gradients of both surfaces must be colinear.\n\nCompute the gradients.\n\nSphere's gradient at (x,y,z): (2x, 2y, 2z).\n\nTorus's equation: F(x,y,z) = (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 -9 =0.\n\nCompute \u2207F:\n\nPartial derivative with respect to x: 2(x - (a -6)).\n\nPartial derivative with respect to y:\n\nd/dy [ (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 ] + 0 =\n\n2(sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)*( (y)/sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) )\n\nSimilarly for z:\n\n2(sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)*( z / sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) )\n\nTherefore, \u2207F = ( 2(x - (a -6)), 2(sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)*(y / sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)), 2(sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)*(z / sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)) )\n\nThe gradients must be proportional:\n\n(2x, 2y, 2z) = \u03bb*( 2(x - (a -6)), 2(sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)*(y / sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)), 2(sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)*(z / sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)) )\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n(x, y, z) = \u03bb*( (x - (a -6)), (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)*(y / sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)), (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)*(z / sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)) )\n\nLet me denote s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2), so the equations become:\n\nx = \u03bb*(x - (a -6)),\n\ny = \u03bb*( (s -6)*(y/s) ),\n\nz = \u03bb*( (s -6)*(z/s) ).\n\nLet me consider the y and z components first. \n\nFrom the y-component:\n\ny = \u03bb*( (s -6)/s * y )\n\nIf y \u2260 0, we can divide both sides by y:\n\n1 = \u03bb*( (s -6)/s )\n\nSimilarly, for z \u2260 0,\n\n1 = \u03bb*( (s -6)/s )\n\nTherefore, either y and z are zero, or \u03bb*( (s -6)/s ) =1.\n\nCase 1: y = z =0.\n\nThen, the point is (x, 0, 0). Plugging into the sphere equation: x\u00b2 = 121 \u21d2 x=\u00b111. \n\nPlug into the torus equation: (0 -6)^2 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 =9 \u21d2 36 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 =9 \u21d2 (x - (a -6))\u00b2 =-27, impossible. So no solution here.\n\nCase 2: \u03bb*( (s -6)/s ) =1 \u21d2 \u03bb = s/(s -6).\n\nFrom the x-component equation:\n\nx = \u03bb*(x - (a -6)) \u21d2 substituting \u03bb:\n\nx = [s/(s -6)]*(x - (a -6)).\n\nMultiply both sides by (s -6):\n\nx(s -6) = s(x - (a -6)) \u21d2\n\nxs -6x = sx - s(a -6) \u21d2\n\n-6x = -s(a -6) \u21d2\n\n6x = s(a -6).\n\nSo, 6x = s(a -6).\n\nNow, recall that from the sphere equation: x\u00b2 + s\u00b2 =121.\n\nWe also have the torus equation:\n\n(s -6)^2 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 =9.\n\nWe now have three equations:\n\n1) 6x = s(a -6)\n\n2) x\u00b2 + s\u00b2 =121\n\n3) (s -6)^2 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 =9.\n\nWe can try to solve these equations.\n\nFrom equation 1: s = 6x / (a -6).\n\nSubstitute s into equation 2:\n\nx\u00b2 + [6x/(a-6)]\u00b2 =121 \u21d2\n\nx\u00b2 + 36x\u00b2/(a-6)^2 =121 \u21d2\n\nx\u00b2 [1 + 36/(a-6)^2 ] =121 \u21d2\n\nx\u00b2 = 121 / [1 + 36/(a-6)^2 ] \u21d2\n\nx\u00b2 = 121*(a-6)^2 / [ (a-6)^2 + 36 ]\n\nSimilarly, from equation 1, s =6x/(a-6).\n\nLet me substitute s and x in terms of a into equation 3.\n\nFirst, compute x - (a -6) = x -a +6.\n\nFrom equation 1: x = s(a-6)/6 \u21d2 x = [6x/(a-6)]*(a-6)/6 = x, so that's consistent. \n\nWait, perhaps express x - (a -6):\n\nx - (a -6) = x - a +6.\n\nWe can write equation 3 as:\n\n(s -6)^2 + (x -a +6)^2 =9.\n\nSubstitute s =6x/(a-6):\n\n[ (6x/(a-6) ) -6 ]^2 + (x -a +6)^2 =9.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term:\n\n6x/(a-6) -6 = 6(x - (a-6))/(a-6) = 6/(a-6)*(x - (a-6))\n\nThus, squared:\n\n[6/(a-6)]\u00b2 (x - (a-6))\u00b2\n\nSecond term:\n\n(x -a +6)^2 = (x - (a -6))^2\n\nTherefore, equation 3 becomes:\n\n[36/(a-6)^2]*(x - (a -6))\u00b2 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 =9\n\nFactor out (x - (a -6))\u00b2:\n\n[36/(a-6)^2 +1]*(x - (a -6))\u00b2 =9\n\nLet me express this as:\n\n[ (36 + (a-6)^2 ) / (a-6)^2 ]*(x - (a -6))\u00b2 =9\n\nMultiply both sides by (a-6)^2:\n\n(36 + (a-6)^2 )*(x - (a -6))\u00b2 =9*(a-6)^2\n\nFrom equation 1: 6x = s(a -6) \u21d2 s =6x/(a-6)\n\nBut s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2), which is the same as the s we defined earlier.\n\nWe also have from equation 1: x = s(a -6)/6\n\nBut perhaps it's better to express (x - (a -6)) in terms of x.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote D = x - (a -6). Then,\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nx = (s(a -6))/6 \u21d2 D = (s(a -6))/6 - (a -6) = (a -6)(s/6 -1 )\n\nBut s =6x/(a -6), so substituting:\n\nD = (a -6)( [6x/(6(a -6))] -1 ) = (a -6)( x/(a -6) -1 ) = x - (a -6) = D, which is consistent.\n\nAlternatively, we can express D in terms of x.\n\nBut perhaps plug in x from equation 2.\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Let me instead proceed by substituting x from equation 1 into equation 3.\n\nLet me denote x = [s(a -6)] /6 from equation 1,\n\nand s = sqrt(121 -x\u00b2) from the sphere equation.\n\nBut this might not help. Let me instead use the expression for x\u00b2 from equation 2:\n\nx\u00b2 = 121*(a-6)^2 / [ (a-6)^2 + 36 ]\n\nLet me substitute this into equation 3's transformed equation:\n\n[ (36 + (a-6)^2 ) / (a-6)^2 ]*(x - (a -6))\u00b2 =9\n\nLet me compute (x - (a -6))\u00b2:\n\nx - (a -6) = x -a +6 \u21d2 (x - (a -6))\u00b2 = (x -a +6)^2\n\nLet me express this in terms of x:\n\n(x -a +6)^2 = (x - (a -6))^2.\n\nLet me denote K = a -6 for simplicity. Then K = a -6, so a = K +6.\n\nThus, equation 3 becomes:\n\n[36 + K\u00b2)/K\u00b2]*(x - K)^2 =9\n\nBut x is expressed in terms of K and a, which is now K +6.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx\u00b2 =121*K\u00b2/(K\u00b2 + 36)\n\nThus, x = sqrt(121*K\u00b2/(K\u00b2 +36)) = (11K)/sqrt(K\u00b2 +36)\n\nTherefore, x - K = (11K)/sqrt(K\u00b2 +36) - K = K [ 11/sqrt(K\u00b2 +36) -1 ]\n\nTherefore, (x - K)^2 = K\u00b2 [ (11/sqrt(K\u00b2 +36) -1 )^2 ]\n\nPlugging back into equation 3:\n\n[ (36 + K\u00b2)/K\u00b2 ] * K\u00b2 [ (11/sqrt(K\u00b2 +36) -1 )^2 ] =9 \u21d2\n\n(36 + K\u00b2) [ (11/sqrt(K\u00b2 +36) -1 )^2 ] =9\n\nLet me simplify term inside the brackets:\n\nLet me denote M = sqrt(K\u00b2 +36). Then,\n\n11/M -1 = (11 - M)/M\n\nThus, the expression becomes:\n\n( M\u00b2 ) [ (11 - M)^2 / M\u00b2 ] = (11 - M)^2.\n\nTherefore:\n\n(36 + K\u00b2)*( (11 - M)^2 ) / M\u00b2 =9?\n\nWait, wait, let me check:\n\nWait, (36 + K\u00b2) is equal to M\u00b2, since M = sqrt(K\u00b2 +36), so M\u00b2 = K\u00b2 +36.\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\nM\u00b2 * [ (11 - M)^2 / M\u00b2 ] = (11 - M)^2\n\nThus, equation simplifies to:\n\n(11 - M)^2 =9 \u21d2\n\n11 - M = \u00b13 \u21d2\n\nM =11 \u00b13 \u21d2\n\nM =14 or M=8.\n\nBut M = sqrt(K\u00b2 +36).\n\nSo:\n\nCase 1: sqrt(K\u00b2 +36) =14 \u21d2 K\u00b2 +36=196 \u21d2 K\u00b2=160 \u21d2 K=\u00b14\u221a10.\n\nCase 2: sqrt(K\u00b2 +36)=8 \u21d2 K\u00b2 +36=64 \u21d2 K\u00b2=28 \u21d2 K=\u00b12\u221a7.\n\nRecall that K = a -6. \n\nNow, let's consider the two scenarios: internal tangent and external tangent.\n\nFor internal tangent (torus inside sphere), the distance between centers a must be less than the sphere's radius. Since the sphere has radius 11, and the torus is inside, the center is at a distance a from the origin, so a <11. \n\nFor external tangent (torus outside sphere), the distance between centers must be greater than sphere's radius plus the torus's minimum distance, so a > 11 + (a's minimum? Wait, need to think.\n\nWait, for internal tangent, the farthest point on the torus is at a + (R + r) = a +9, which must equal the sphere's radius (11). So a +9=11 \u21d2 a=2. Thus K = a-6 =2-6= -4.\n\nWait, so K = -4.\n\nCheck if this matches one of the cases above.\n\nIf K = -4, then sqrt(K\u00b2 +36)=sqrt(16+36)=sqrt(52)=2*sqrt(13)\u22487.21, which doesn't match M=14 or 8. So maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps need to consider the cases for internal and external tangency in terms of K.\n\nWait, perhaps my previous substitution has an error. Let me see:\n\nWait, we derived that (11 - M)^2 =9 \u21d2 M =14 or 8. Since M = sqrt(K\u00b2 +36).\n\nThen:\n\nFor M=14:\n\nsqrt(K\u00b2 +36)=14 \u21d2 K\u00b2 =196-36=160 \u21d2 K=\u00b14\u221a10 \u2248 \u00b112.649.\n\nFor M=8:\n\nsqrt(K\u00b2 +36)=8 \u21d2 K\u00b2=64-36=28 \u21d2 K=\u00b12\u221a7\u2248\u00b15.2915.\n\nNow, relating this back to the cases:\n\nFor internal tangent (a=2):\n\nThen K = a -6 = -4.\n\nCompute M for K=-4: sqrt(16+36)=\u221a52\u22487.21, which is not 8 or 14. So this case is not captured here. Hmm, problem.\n\nPerhaps my approach has a mistake. Let me think differently.\n\nGiven that for internal tangent, a=2 (so K= a-6= -4), then we can plug into the equations.\n\nLet me proceed with the internal tangent case where a=2.\n\nThen, K = a -6 = -4.\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx\u00b2 =121*(K)^2/(K\u00b2 +36) = 121*(16)/(16+36)=121*16/52= (121*4)/13= 484/13.\n\nThus x= \u00b1\u221a(484/13)= \u00b122/\u221a13 \u2248 \u00b16.118.\n\nBut in the internal tangent case, the farthest point should be at x=11, but this gives x\u2248\u00b16.118. Hmm, inconsistency.\n\nWait, perhaps the assumption that a=2 is incorrect? \n\nWait, earlier I assumed that for internal tangent, the farthest point is a +9 =11 \u21d2 a=2, but maybe the maximum distance isn't simply a +9. \n\nPerhaps that simple model is incorrect because the torus is not a sphere, so the maximum distance isn\u2019t just the distance from the center plus the torus's radius. \n\nHence, my previous approach is flawed. I need to find another way.\n\nAlternative Idea:\n\nThe circle of tangency lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers of the sphere and torus. In this plane, both the sphere and torus appear as circles, and their radii must satisfy the condition of tangency.\n\nLet me denote the distance between the centers as 'd'. For internal tangent, the sphere's radius R =11 and the torus's \"effective\" radius at that plane must be such that the distance between centers minus the torus's radius equals the sphere's radius? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, in the plane of tangency (perpendicular to the line connecting centers), the sphere has a circle of radius sqrt(R\u00b2 - (d/2)^2), and the torus has a circle of radius sqrt((R_torus)^2 - (d/2)^2). For tangency, these radii must be equal?\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula for the radius of the circle of intersection between two spheres, but the torus is not a sphere.\n\nAlternatively, consider the following:\n\nThe radius of the circle of tangency can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers. Let me denote the distance between the centers as 'd'. The radius r of the circle of tangency is sqrt(R\u00b2 - (d/2)^2) for two spheres, but for a torus and sphere, it's different.\n\nLet me think of the torus as a surface where every point is at a fixed distance from its axis. The sphere is centered at the origin.\n\nThe circle of tangency must satisfy that their normals are colinear, so the line connecting the centers of the two surfaces must pass through the point of tangency. Therefore, the circle of tangency lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers, and the radius of the circle can be found by considering the geometry in that plane.\n\nLet me consider the case where the torus is inside the sphere and tangent. The centers are separated by distance 'd'. In the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers, the sphere's cross-section is a circle of radius sqrt(11\u00b2 - (d/2)^2). The torus's cross-section in that plane is also a circle. The radius of this circle would depend on the torus's parameters and the distance 'd'.\n\nThe torus has a major radius R=6 and minor radius r=3. The cross-section of the torus in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers (assuming the axis of the torus is aligned with this line) would be a circle with radius equal to the minor radius, 3. But the position of this circle depends on 'd'.\n\nWait, perhaps the cross-sectional radius of the torus is sqrt(R\u00b2 - (d/2)^2 + r\u00b2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the radius of the torus's cross-section in the plane would be sqrt(r\u00b2 + (R - (d/2))\u00b2 )?\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe an example with known values.\n\nSuppose the torus is centered at (a,0,0), distance from origin is 'd' =a. The closest point on the torus to the origin is d - (R + r)= a -9, and the farthest is a +9. To have internal tangent, set a +9 =11 \u21d2 a=2. \n\nIn this case, the circle of tangency is the set of points on the torus at distance 11 from the origin. \n\nThe points on the torus are at (x,y,z) where (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x - (a -6))\u00b2 =9. With a=2, this becomes:\n\n(sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x - (-4))\u00b2 =9 \u21d2 (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x+4)^2 =9.\n\nThe sphere equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121.\n\nLet me find the intersection of these two equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Then the torus equation becomes:\n\n(s -6)^2 + (x+4)^2 =9,\n\nand the sphere equation is x\u00b2 + s\u00b2 =121.\n\nExpand the torus equation:\n\ns\u00b2 -12s +36 +x\u00b2 +8x +16 =9 \u21d2\n\ns\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -12s +8x +52 =9 \u21d2 s\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -12s +8x =-43.\n\nFrom sphere equation, s\u00b2 =121 -x\u00b2. Substitute into above:\n\n121 -x\u00b2 +x\u00b2 -12s +8x =-43 \u21d2 121 -12s +8x =-43 \u21d2\n\n-12s +8x =-164 \u21d2\n\n12s -8x =164 \u21d2\n\nDivide by 4: 3s -2x =41 \u21d2 3s =2x +41 \u21d2 s=(2x +41)/3.\n\nSubstitute into sphere equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + [(2x +41)/3]^2 =121 \u21d2\n\nx\u00b2 + (4x\u00b2 +164x +1681)/9 =121 \u21d2\n\nMultiply by 9:\n\n9x\u00b2 +4x\u00b2 +164x +1681 =1089 \u21d2\n\n13x\u00b2 +164x +1681 -1089 =0 \u21d2\n\n13x\u00b2 +164x +592 =0.\n\nCompute discriminant D =164\u00b2 -4*13*592.\n\n164\u00b2=26896\n\n4*13*592=4*13*592=52*592=52*(500+92)=52*500 +52*92=26000 +4784=30784\n\nThus D=26896 -30784= -3888 <0.\n\nNo real solution, which contradicts the problem's statement. So something is wrong.\n\nHmm, this suggests that when a=2, there is no real intersection, which can't be since the problem says they are tangent. Therefore, my assumption of the torus's equation must be wrong.\n\nPerhaps the major radius R is not 6 when shifted? Wait, the major radius is fixed as 6 because it's defined by the distance from the generating circle's center to its axis, which must remain 6. Hence, shifting the torus doesn't change R.\n\nThis is a real problem. Maybe I need to use a different parametrization.\n\nAlternative Approach:\n\nLet me think of the torus as a surface where any point on it is at a distance r from a circle of radius R (axis). Here, R=6 and r=3. The sphere is radius 11.\n\nWhen the torus is internally tangent to the sphere, the closest points between the torus and the sphere form the tangent circle. Wait, no, for internal tangent, it's the farthest points.\n\nWait, the problem states when T rests on the inside of S, it's internally tangent along a circle. Internal tangent would mean the torus is inside the sphere, and they touch along a circle where the sphere curves inward. So the points of tangency are the points on the torus that are farthest from the sphere's center.\n\nSimilarly, when on the outside, externally tangent, the closest points (from the sphere's center) on the torus touch the sphere.\n\nTherefore, the radii r_i and r_o are the radii of these tangent circles.\n\nTo find the radii of these circles, consider that in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers (which is along the line from the sphere's center to the torus's center), the intersection is a circle whose radius can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nLet me denote the distance between the centers as D. For internal tangent (D = a), the radius of the tangent circle is sqrt(R_sphere\u00b2 - (D + R_torus_outer)^2)? Not sure.\n\nWait, let me consider the internal tangent case first. The sphere has radius 11, the torus's farthest point from the origin is D + R_torus_outer, where R_torus_outer = R + r =9. So setting D +9 =11 \u21d2 D=2.\n\nIn the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers (distance D=2), the sphere has a cross-sectional radius of sqrt(11\u00b2 - (D/2)^2). Wait, no, the cross-section of the sphere in a plane at distance D/2 from the center would have radius sqrt(11\u00b2 - (D/2)^2).\n\nWait, actually, the cross-section of the sphere in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers and passing through the tangent circle's center would have radius sqrt(11\u00b2 - (D/2)^2). Similarly, the cross-section of the torus in that plane would have a radius of sqrt(r\u00b2 + (R - (D/2))^2). \n\nWait, this might be the right approach.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\nWhen two surfaces are tangent, the circle of tangency lies in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting their centers. Let the distance between centers be D. In that plane, the sphere is a circle of radius sqrt(R_sphere\u00b2 - (D/2)^2), because the distance from the sphere's center to the plane is D/2.\n\nThe torus, when viewed in this plane, appears as two circles (since it's a torus). The radius of the relevant circle (the outer one for internal tangent) would be sqrt(r_torus\u00b2 + (R_torus - D/2)^2). Wait, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, the cross-sectional radius of the torus in that plane can be calculated as follows:\n\nThe torus has a major radius R=6 (distance from generating circle's center to axis), minor radius r=3. The axis of the torus is offset from the sphere's center by distance D. The cross-section of the torus in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers (distance D) would be a circle with radius sqrt(r\u00b2 + (R - (D/2))^2).\n\nWait, this might need more precise derivation.\n\nLet me consider the torus's cross-section in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers. Let's set up coordinates so that the line connecting the centers is the x-axis, with the sphere's center at (0,0,0) and the torus's center at (D,0,0). The axis of the torus is a line parallel to the y-axis (since the major radius is along the line from the generating circle's center to the axis). Wait, no.\n\nActually, the axis of the torus must be offset from its generating circle's center by R=6. If the torus's center (generating circle's center) is at (D,0,0), then its axis is located at (D -6,0,0) along the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, in the plane perpendicular to the x-axis at x = D/2 (midway between the centers), the cross-section of the torus is a circle. The distance from the axis of the torus (at x=D-6) to this plane is |D/2 - (D -6)| = | -D/2 +6 | = |6 - D/2|.\n\nThe radius of the torus's cross-section in this plane would then be sqrt(r\u00b2 + (distance)^2) ?\n\nWait, no. The cross-section of the torus in that plane is a circle whose radius is the minor radius r=3, but shifted along the axis. \n\nAlternatively, the cross-sectional radius is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (R - (D/2))^2 ), where R is the major radius, and D/2 is the distance from the sphere's center to the plane.\n\nWait, let me think of the torus as a circle of radius r=3, rotated around an axis at distance R=6 from its center. The cross-section in a plane perpendicular to the axis at a distance s from the generating circle's center would have a radius of sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). \n\nHowever, in this case, the distance between centers is D. The plane midway between the two centers is at x=D/2. The distance from the torus's generating circle's center (at x=D) to this plane is D - D/2 = D/2. The axis of the torus is at x=D-6, so the distance from the axis to the plane is (D -6) - (D/2) = D/2 -6. \n\nThe cross-sectional radius of the torus in that plane would then be sqrt(r\u00b2 + (R - (distance from axis to plane))^2). Wait, this is getting too confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-sectional radius of the torus in the plane is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (R - (D/2 - offset))^2). \n\nAlternatively, let me use the following formula for the radius of the circle of intersection between a sphere and a torus:\n\nWhen two surfaces are tangent, the radius of the tangent circle can be found using the formula:\n\nr = (R_sphere * R_torus) / sqrt(R_sphere\u00b2 + R_torus\u00b2 \u00b1 ... ) \n\nNo, that might not apply here.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the internal tangent case where the distance between centers is D=2. In the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers (x-axis), the sphere's cross-section is a circle with radius sqrt(11\u00b2 -1^2)=sqrt(121 -1)=sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30).\n\nThe torus's cross-section in this plane would be a circle. The generating circle's center is at x=2, so the axis of the torus is at x=2-6=-4. The distance from the axis to the plane x=1 (midway between 0 and 2) is |-4 -1|=5. The cross-sectional radius of the torus is sqrt(3\u00b2 +5\u00b2)=sqrt(34). \n\nThus, the two circles (sphere and torus) in this plane must be tangent. The sphere's radius is sqrt(120)\u224810.954, and the torus's cross-section has radius sqrt(34)\u22485.830. The distance between their centers in this plane is the distance between the sphere's center projection (0) and the torus's cross-section center (which is at x=1, but in the plane perpendicular to x-axis, the position is... Hmm, maybe this is not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting centers (the x-axis), the sphere's cross-section is centered at (0,0) with radius sqrt(11\u00b2 - (D/2)^2)=sqrt(121 -1)=sqrt(120). The torus's cross-section in this plane would be centered at the projection of its generating circle's center onto the plane. Since the generating circle's center is at (D,0,0)=(2,0,0), the projection in the plane perpendicular at x=D/2=1 would have a position offset. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the cross-section of the torus is a circle centered at (D/2,0) with radius sqrt(r\u00b2 + (R - D/2)^2). Let me try that.\n\nWith R=6, r=3, D=2:\n\nRadius of torus's cross-section: sqrt(3\u00b2 + (6 -1)^2)=sqrt(9+25)=sqrt(34).\n\nThe sphere's cross-sectional radius is sqrt(11\u00b2 -1^2)=sqrt(120).\n\nThe distance between the centers of these two circles (sphere at (0,0) and torus at (1,0)) is 1 unit. For them to be tangent internally (since torus is inside sphere), the sum of their radii should equal the distance between centers? Wait, no, internal tangent would mean the sphere's radius minus the torus's radius equals the distance between centers:\n\nsqrt(120) - sqrt(34) =1? Let me check:\n\nsqrt(120) \u224810.954, sqrt(34)\u22485.830, difference \u22485.124 \u2248 not 1. \n\nHmm, so that doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, the distance between centers should be equal to the difference of radii for internal tangent:\n\nsqrt(120) - sqrt(34) \u22485.124, which would mean the centers are separated by that distance, but in reality the separation is 1. So not matching.\n\nThis suggests the formula is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the cross-section's radius of the torus is different.\n\nLet me think differently: In the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers (the x-axis), at a distance of D/2 from the sphere's center (which is at x=0), the torus's cross-section is a circle. The torus's generating circle is centered at x=D (x=2), and its axis is at x=D-6=-4. \n\nThe distance from the axis (x=-4) to the plane x=D/2=1 is |-4 -1|=5. \n\nThe cross-section of the torus in this plane is a circle with radius sqrt(r\u00b2 + (distance)^2)=sqrt(3\u00b2 +5\u00b2)=sqrt(34). \n\nThis circle is centered at the projection of the generating circle's center onto the plane. The generating circle's center is at (2,0,0). The plane is at x=1, so the projection is (1,0,0). The center of the torus's cross-section is at (1,0,0). \n\nThe sphere's cross-section in this plane is a circle centered at (0,0) with radius sqrt(121 -1)=sqrt(120). \n\nThe distance between the centers of these two circles is 1 unit (from (0,0) to (1,0)). For them to be tangent, the sum or difference of radii should equal this distance.\n\nFor internal tangent (sphere contains torus):\n\nsqrt(120) - sqrt(34) should equal 1?\n\nsqrt(120) \u224810.954, sqrt(34)\u22485.830, difference\u22485.124, which is not 1. So not tangent.\n\nTherefore, this approach is not working.\n\nPerhaps I need to use the earlier equations but solve for r_i and r_o.\n\nLet me return to the equations for the internal tangent case where the distance between centers is a=2.\n\nWe had the equation 13x\u00b2 +164x +592 =0 with discriminant negative, which suggests no real solutions, meaning the torus and sphere don't intersect, contradicting the problem's statement. \n\nThis implies that my torus equation must be incorrect. \n\nWait, going back to the beginning, the problem states the torus is formed by revolving a circle of radius 3 around an axis 6 units away in its plane. This should be a standard torus with major radius 6 and minor 3. The equation is (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) -6)^2 + z\u00b2 =9 when the axis is the z-axis. \n\nIf the sphere is centered at the origin with radius 11, then the maximum distance from the origin to the torus is sqrt( (6+3)^2 ) =9, so the torus is entirely inside the sphere. There is no way they can be tangent internally unless the torus is moved closer. \n\nAh! Here's the key: the problem says \"when T rests on the inside of S\". This implies that the torus is placed inside the sphere such that it touches it along a circle. To do this, the torus must be shifted so that its center is offset from the sphere's center. \n\nThe previous assumption that the generating circle's center is fixed at (6,0,0) is incorrect because the problem allows the torus to be positioned anywhere inside the sphere. The axis can be anywhere, as long as it's in the plane of the generating circle, 6 units from its center. \n\nTherefore, to maximize the distance from the origin, we can position the torus such that the line connecting the sphere's center (origin) and the torus's generating circle's center is along the line of the axis. \n\nWait, let me consider the following configuration:\n\nLet the sphere be at the origin. The torus is positioned such that its generating circle's center is at a point C, and the axis of the torus is along the line from the origin to C, and 6 units away from C. \n\nLet me denote the distance between the origin and C as 'd'. The axis is a line in the plane of the generating circle (which contains point C), at a distance of 6 units from C. To have the axis along the line OC (from origin to C), the axis must be colinear with OC, but offset by 6 units from C towards the origin. \n\nTherefore, the axis is located at a distance of d -6 from the origin along the line OC. \n\nThe farthest point on the torus from the origin will be along the line OC, at a distance of d + (major radius + minor radius) =d +9. \n\nTo have internal tangency with the sphere of radius 11:\n\nd +9 =11 \u21d2d=2.\n\nThus, the generating circle's center is 2 units from the origin, and the axis is 6 units from it, so the axis is at d -6 = -4 units from the origin along the line OC. \n\nThe closest point on the torus to the origin is d -9 =2-9=-7, but distance can't be negative, so it's 7 units away? \n\nWait, the minimum distance from origin to torus would be the distance from origin to the axis minus the major radius and minor radius? Not sure.\n\nAnyway, with d=2, the farthest point on the torus is at 11 units from the origin, which is on the sphere.\n\nThe circle of tangency is the set of points on the torus at distance 11 from the origin. To find its radius, consider the cross-section perpendicular to OC (the line connecting the centers).\n\nIn that plane, the sphere's cross-section is a circle of radius sqrt(11\u00b2 - (d/2)^2)=sqrt(121-1)=sqrt(120).\n\nThe torus's cross-section in this plane is a circle. The generating circle is at distance d=2 from the origin, so the axis is at distance d-6= -4 from the origin along OC. The cross-section plane is perpendicular to OC at its midpoint (distance d/2=1 from origin).\n\nThe distance from the axis to this plane is | -4 -1 | =5 units. \n\nThe cross-sectional radius of the torus is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (distance)^2)=sqrt(3\u00b2+5\u00b2)=sqrt(34).\n\nThe center of the torus's cross-section is at (d/2,0) = (1,0) in this plane, while the sphere's cross-section is centered at (0,0). The distance between centers is 1 unit. \n\nFor the two circles to be tangent internally (since torus is inside sphere), the difference of their radii should equal the distance between centers:\n\nsqrt(120) - sqrt(34) = distance between centers =1?\n\nCompute sqrt(120) - sqrt(34) \u224810.954 -5.830\u22485.124\u22601. Not tangent.\n\nHmm, so this is still inconsistent. \n\nPerhaps the cross-sectional radius of the torus is not sqrt(r\u00b2 + (distance)^2). \n\nLet me think differently. The cross-section of the torus in the plane perpendicular to OC is a circle whose radius is the minor radius, 3. The center of this circle is offset from the torus's generating circle's center projection onto the plane by the major radius?\n\nWait, the generating circle's center is at distance d=2 from the origin. The cross-section plane is at distance d/2=1 from the origin towards the torus. The distance from the generating circle's center to the cross-section plane is d - d/2 =d/2=1. \n\nThe cross-sectional radius of the torus in that plane would then be sqrt(r\u00b2 + (R - distance)^2) where R is the major radius (6), and distance is the distance from the generating circle's center to the plane (1). Thus:\n\nsqrt(3\u00b2 + (6-1)^2)=sqrt(9+25)=sqrt(34). \n\nSame as before. \n\nThe sphere's cross-section has radius sqrt(121 -1)=sqrt(120). \n\nFor the two circles to be tangent, the distance between centers (1) must equal the difference of radii:\n\nsqrt(120) - sqrt(34) \u22485.124 \u2248 not 1.\n\nTherefore, this suggests that the torus and sphere are not tangent in this configuration, contradicting the problem's statement. \n\nI must be making a fundamental mistake. Let me read the problem again:\n\n\"Torus T is the surface produced by revolving a circle with radius 3 around an axis in the plane of the circle that is a distance 6 from the center of the circle (so like a donut). Let S be a sphere with a radius 11. When T rests on the inside of S, it is internally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_i, and when T rests on the outside of S, it is externally tangent to S along a circle with radius r_o. The difference r_i\u2212r_o can be written as m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m+n.\"\n\nAh! Maybe \"resting on the inside\" means that the torus is placed such that its axis is along the line connecting the centers, and the generating circle's center is located such that the torus touches the sphere along a circle. The previous calculations suggest that when the center is at 2 units, the farthest points are at 11, but the cross-sectional circles aren't tangent. Perhaps the circle of tangency is not in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers. \n\nAlternatively, the circle of tangency lies in a plane that is not perpendicular. Wait, but for two surfaces of revolution around the same axis, the circle of tangency must be in a plane perpendicular to that axis. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the axis of the torus is not aligned with the line connecting the centers. \n\nThis problem is really challenging. Perhaps I need to look up the formula for the radius of the circle of intersection between a sphere and a torus.\n\nUpon recalling, the radius of the circle of intersection between a sphere and a torus can be found using the following approach:\n\nLet the sphere have radius R and the torus have major radius a and minor radius b. The distance between the centers is d. \n\nThe radius of the circle of intersection is sqrt( (R^2 - (d/2)^2)(1 - (b^2)/( (a - d/2)^2 + b^2 )) )\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, using the equations:\n\nSphere: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = R\u00b2,\n\nTorus: (sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) - a)^2 + z\u00b2 = b\u00b2.\n\nTo find the intersection, set s = sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2).\n\nThen, (s -a)^2 + z\u00b2 = b\u00b2,\n\nand s\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = R\u00b2.\n\nSubtracting the torus equation from the sphere equation:\n\ns\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - [ (s -a)^2 + z\u00b2 ] = R\u00b2 - b\u00b2 \u21d2\n\ns\u00b2 - (s\u00b2 -2as +a\u00b2) = R\u00b2 -b\u00b2 \u21d2\n\n2as -a\u00b2 = R\u00b2 -b\u00b2 \u21d2\n\ns = (R\u00b2 - b\u00b2 +a\u00b2)/(2a).\n\nThe intersection is a circle in the plane s = constant. The radius of this circle is sqrt(R\u00b2 - s\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the radius of the circle of intersection is sqrt( R\u00b2 - [ (R\u00b2 - b\u00b2 +a\u00b2)/(2a) ]\u00b2 ).\n\nFor the intersection to be a single circle (tangent), the equations must have exactly one solution, which requires that the two surfaces are tangent, so the discriminant must be zero, but actually, the above gives the radius for any intersection.\n\nWait, but for tangency, there must be exactly one circle, so perhaps the system has only one solution? Not sure. \n\nWait, the above equations give the radius of the intersection circle as sqrt( R\u00b2 - s\u00b2 ), where s is the radial distance from the axis. \n\nTo have the surfaces tangent, the gradients must be proportional, which would occur when the derivative conditions are met, which might correspond to a specific s.\n\nAlternatively, for the surfaces to be tangent, the equations must have exactly one circle of intersection, so the expression for s must yield a single value, but the above formula already gives s in terms of R, a, and b.\n\nWait, perhaps when the torus is tangent internally to the sphere, the value of s is such that the two surfaces meet at exactly one circle (i.e., the intersection is a single circle with zero radius?), but that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the condition for tangency is that the equations have a solution where the two surfaces meet along a single circle, which requires that the expression for s yields a single valid solution. \n\nThe radius of the intersection circle is sqrt(R\u00b2 - s\u00b2), where s = (R\u00b2 - b\u00b2 +a\u00b2)/(2a).\n\nFor the surfaces to be tangent, this radius must be zero, meaning R\u00b2 = s\u00b2. \n\nSetting R\u00b2 = [ (R\u00b2 - b\u00b2 +a\u00b2)/(2a) ]\u00b2,\n\nthen solving for the distance between centers 'd'? Wait, but where does 'd' come into play?\n\nWait, in this derivation, the torus is assumed to be centered at the origin, so the distance between centers is zero. But in our problem, the torus is not centered at the origin. \n\nThis suggests my previous approach was incorrect because I assumed the torus was centered at the origin. \n\nTo generalize, let me consider the torus offset by a distance 'd' along the x-axis. The equations become:\n\nSphere: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = R\u00b2,\n\nTorus: (sqrt( (x - d)^2 + y\u00b2 ) - a)^2 + z\u00b2 = b\u00b2,\n\nwhere a is the major radius (6), b is the minor radius (3), and d is the distance between centers.\n\nTo find the intersection:\n\nLet s = sqrt( (x - d)^2 + y\u00b2 ).\n\nThen the torus equation is (s -a)^2 + z\u00b2 = b\u00b2,\n\nand the sphere equation is (x)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = R\u00b2.\n\nExpress x in terms of s: x = sqrt(s\u00b2 + (d^2 - 2d(x - d)) ) \u2013 no, better to write sphere equation as x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - z\u00b2,\n\nand torus equation: (s -a)^2 + z\u00b2 = b\u00b2.\n\nBut s = sqrt( (x - d)^2 + y\u00b2 ).\n\nLet me denote u = x - d,\n\nthen s = sqrt(u\u00b2 + y\u00b2),\n\nand the sphere equation becomes (u +d)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = R\u00b2.\n\nThe torus equation: (s -a)^2 + z\u00b2 = b\u00b2.\n\nLet me try to subtract equations:\n\nSphere: (u +d)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = R\u00b2,\n\nTorus: (s -a)^2 + z\u00b2 = b\u00b2.\n\nSubtract torus from sphere:\n\n(u +d)^2 + y\u00b2 - (s\u00b2 - 2a s +a\u00b2) = R\u00b2 -b\u00b2.\n\nBut s\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + y\u00b2,\n\nso substituting:\n\n(u +d)^2 + y\u00b2 - (u\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 2a s +a\u00b2) = R\u00b2 -b\u00b2,\n\nExpand (u +d)^2 = u\u00b2 + 2ud +d\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nu\u00b2 + 2ud +d\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -u\u00b2 - y\u00b2 +2a s -a\u00b2 = R\u00b2 -b\u00b2,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2ud +d\u00b2 +2a s -a\u00b2 = R\u00b2 -b\u00b2,\n\nRearranged:\n\n2a s = R\u00b2 -b\u00b2 -2ud -d\u00b2 +a\u00b2,\n\nThis seems complex. \n\nLet me consider the case where the surfaces are tangent, so their normals are colinear, which might imply that the derivative conditions lead to a specific relationship between the variables.\n\nAlternatively, for the intersection to be a single circle (tangent), the equations must have a unique solution in some variables, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven time constraints and complexity, perhaps I should compute r_i and r_o using the formula for the intersection radius.\n\nFrom the standard case where the torus is centered at (d,0,0), the radius of the circle of intersection is sqrt(R\u00b2 - s\u00b2), where s = (R\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + (a + d)^2 )/(2(a + d)) ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using the previous formula when the torus is centered at (d,0,0):\n\nThe sphere equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121,\n\nTorus equation: (sqrt( (x -d)^2 + y\u00b2 ) -6)^2 + z\u00b2 =9.\n\nFollowing the previous method, let s = sqrt( (x -d)^2 + y\u00b2 ),\n\nthen sphere equation: (x)^2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121 \u21d2 (x)^2 + y\u00b2 =121 - z\u00b2,\n\ntorus equation: (s -6)^2 + z\u00b2 =9 \u21d2 z\u00b2 =9 - (s -6)^2,\n\nSubstitute z\u00b2 into sphere equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +9 - (s -6)^2 =121 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (s\u00b2 -12s +36) =112,\n\nBut s\u00b2 = (x -d)^2 + y\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - ( (x -d)^2 + y\u00b2 -12s +36 ) =112,\n\nExpand (x -d)^2 =x\u00b2 -2dx +d\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 +2dx -d\u00b2 - y\u00b2 +12s -36=112,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2dx -d\u00b2 +12s -36 =112,\n\nThen,\n\n12s =112 +d\u00b2 +36 -2dx,\n\n12s =148 +d\u00b2 -2dx,\n\nBut s = sqrt( (x -d)^2 + y\u00b2 ). This still seems intractable.\n\nAlternatively, assume the circle of tangency lies in the equatorial plane of the torus (perpendicular to its axis). \n\nFor internal tangency, the distance between centers must be such that the farthest point on the torus reaches the sphere. \n\nAssuming the axis of the torus is along the line connecting the centers, the farthest point on the torus from the sphere's center is d + (a + b) =d +9. Setting d +9=11 \u21d2d=2.\n\nThe circle of tangency is then the set of points on the torus at distance 11 from the origin. These points form a circle in a plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers. The radius of this circle can be found by considering a right triangle where the hypotenuse is the sphere's radius (11), one leg is the distance from the origin to the plane (d/2=1), and the other leg is the radius of the circle r_i:\n\nr_i = sqrt(11\u00b2 -1\u00b2)=sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30).\n\nSimilarly, for external tangency, the distance between centers is d=20 (since closest point is d -9=11 \u21d2d=20), and the circle of tangency has radius sqrt(11\u00b2 - (20/2)^2)=sqrt(121-100)=sqrt(21).\n\nThus, the difference r_i -r_o =2\u221a30 -\u221a21.\n\nBut this is irrational, but the problem states it can be written as m/n. So this must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the radii are computed differently. \n\nIn the internal tangent case with d=2, the circle of tangency's radius is the minor radius of the torus, which is 3. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the radius of the circle is the minor radius (3), but scaled by the cosine of the angle between the axis and the line of centers. \n\nAlternatively, when the torus is at d=2, the circle of tangency has radius r_i= sqrt(11\u00b2 - (d)^2)=sqrt(121-4)=sqrt(117)=3*sqrt(13). \n\nSimilarly, for external tangent at d=20, r_o= sqrt(11\u00b2 - (20)^2) which is imaginary. Not possible.\n\nThis is really challenging. Perhaps the correct approach is to use the equations for the two cases and compute r_i and r_o symbolically.\n\nLet me consider the general case where the distance between centers is D. The radius of the circle of intersection can be found using the formula derived earlier:\n\nIn the plane perpendicular to the line connecting the centers, the sphere has a cross-sectional radius of sqrt(R\u00b2 - (D/2)^2), and the torus has a cross-sectional radius of sqrt(b\u00b2 + (a - D/2)^2).\n\nFor the surfaces to be tangent, these two cross-sectional circles must be tangent. \n\nFor internal tangent (torus inside sphere), the distance between centers of the cross-sectional circles is D/2 (since the sphere's center is at 0 and the torus's cross-section center is at D/2 along the line). \n\nThe condition for tangency is:\n\nsqrt(R\u00b2 - (D/2)^2) - sqrt(b\u00b2 + (a - D/2)^2) = D/2.\n\nSimilarly, for external tangent (torus outside sphere):\n\nsqrt(b\u00b2 + (a + D/2)^2) - sqrt(R\u00b2 - (D/2)^2) = D/2.\n\nWait, this might be the right approach.\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nFor internal tangent (D is distance between centers):\n\nSphere's cross-section radius: S = sqrt(11\u00b2 - (D/2)^2),\n\nTorus's cross-section radius: T = sqrt(3\u00b2 + (6 - D/2)^2),\n\nDistance between centers in cross-section plane: D/2,\n\nFor internal tangency:\n\nS - T = D/2,\n\nExternal tangency:\n\nT' - S = D'/2,\n\nwhere T' is the torus cross-section radius when outside, and D' is the distance between centers for external case.\n\nLet me solve for D in the internal case:\n\nsqrt(121 - (D^2)/4) - sqrt(9 + (6 - D/2)^2) = D/2,\n\nLet me set x = D/2,\n\nThen equation becomes:\n\nsqrt(121 -x\u00b2) - sqrt(9 + (6 -x)^2) =x.\n\nLet me compute the second sqrt term:\n\nsqrt(9 + (6 -x)^2) = sqrt(9 +36 -12x +x\u00b2)=sqrt(x\u00b2 -12x +45).\n\nThus:\n\nsqrt(121 -x\u00b2) - sqrt(x\u00b2 -12x +45) =x.\n\nLet me isolate one sqrt:\n\nsqrt(121 -x\u00b2) =x + sqrt(x\u00b2 -12x +45).\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n121 -x\u00b2 =x\u00b2 + 2x sqrt(x\u00b2 -12x +45) +x\u00b2 -12x +45.\n\nSimplify:\n\n121 -x\u00b2 =2x\u00b2 -12x +45 +2x sqrt(x\u00b2 -12x +45).\n\nBring all terms except sqrt to left:\n\n121 -x\u00b2 -2x\u00b2 +12x -45 =2x sqrt(x\u00b2 -12x +45).\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n(121 -45) + (-3x\u00b2) +12x =76 -3x\u00b2 +12x.\n\nThus:\n\n76 -3x\u00b2 +12x =2x sqrt(x\u00b2 -12x +45).\n\nDivide both sides by x (assuming x\u22600):\n\n(76/x) -3x +12 =2 sqrt(x\u00b2 -12x +45).\n\nThis is still complicated. Let me move all terms to left and square again:\n\nLet me denote LHS =76 -3x\u00b2 +12x,\n\nRHS=2x sqrt(x\u00b2 -12x +45),\n\nThen equation is LHS = RHS,\n\nSquare both sides:\n\nLHS\u00b2 =4x\u00b2 (x\u00b2 -12x +45).\n\nExpand LHS:\n\n(76 -3x\u00b2 +12x)^2.\n\nThis will be very tedious, but let me proceed.\n\nLet me denote A = -3x\u00b2 +12x +76,\n\nthen A\u00b2 =9x^4 -72x^3 + (144x\u00b2 + 2*3x\u00b2*76) + ... Wait, better to expand step by step.\n\n(76 +12x -3x\u00b2)^2 = ( -3x\u00b2 +12x +76 )^2\n\n= ( -3x\u00b2)^2 + (12x)^2 +76\u00b2 +2*(-3x\u00b2)(12x) +2*(-3x\u00b2)(76) +2*(12x)(76)\n\n=9x^4 +144x\u00b2 +5776 + (-72x\u00b3) + (-456x\u00b2) + 1824x\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n9x^4 -72x\u00b3 + (144x\u00b2 -456x\u00b2) +1824x +5776,\n\n=9x^4 -72x\u00b3 -312x\u00b2 +1824x +5776.\n\nSet equal to RHS squared:\n\n4x\u00b2(x\u00b2 -12x +45) =4x^4 -48x^3 +180x\u00b2.\n\nThus:\n\n9x^4 -72x\u00b3 -312x\u00b2 +1824x +5776 =4x^4 -48x^3 +180x\u00b2,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n5x^4 -24x^3 -492x\u00b2 +1824x +5776=0.\n\nThis quartic equation is difficult to solve. Possibly factorable?\n\nPerhaps try possible rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are \u00b1 factors of 5776 over factors of 5. 5776 divided by 5 is not integer. Maybe it's designed to have x=4?\n\nLet me test x=4:\n\n5*(256) -24*(64) -492*(16) +1824*4 +5776.\n\n5*256=1280,\n\n-24*64= -1536,\n\n-492*16= -7872,\n\n1824*4=7296,\n\n+5776.\n\nTotal:1280 -1536= -256; -256-7872= -8128; -8128+7296= -832; -832 +5776=4944\u22600.\n\nx=2:\n\n5*(16) -24*(8) -492*(4) +1824*2 +5776,\n\n80 -192 -1968 +3648 +5776,\n\n80-192= -112; -112-1968= -2080; -2080+3648=1568; +5776=7344\u22600.\n\nx= something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in derivation.\n\nGiven time constraints, perhaps I should consider that the difference r_i -r_o is (sqrt(121 - (d_i/2)^2) - sqrt(121 - (d_o/2)^2)), where d_i=2 and d_o=20. Then,\n\nr_i= sqrt(121 -1)=sqrt(120),\n\nr_o= sqrt(121 -100)=sqrt(21),\n\nThus difference sqrt(120) -sqrt(21). This is irrational, but the problem states it's m/n. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the radii are computed differently. \n\nWait, another idea: the circle of tangency's radius is the minor radius of the torus, 3, but scaled by the cosine of the angle between the axis and the line connecting centers.\n\nAlternatively, the radius of the circle is the same as the minor radius, so r_i=r_o=3, difference 0. Not likely.\n\nAlternatively, when the torus is internally tangent, its generating circle's center is at distance D from the sphere's center. The circle of tangency has radius sqrt(D^2 - (6-3)^2)=sqrt(D^2 -9). \n\nFor internal tangent, D=2, so sqrt(4-9)=imaginary. No.\n\nAlternatively, r_i= sqrt( (11)^2 - (6+3)^2 )=sqrt(121-81)=sqrt(40)=2*sqrt(10).\n\nSimilarly, external tangent: r_o= sqrt( (11)^2 - (6-3)^2)=sqrt(121-9)=sqrt(112)=4*sqrt(7).\n\nThus difference is 2\u221a10 -4\u221a7, but still irrational.\n\nHmm, this is frustrating. Perhaps the correct answer is 179/15, m+n=194, but I need to think differently.\n\nWait, let me go back to the initial equations when the torus is centered at (a,0,0).\n\nUsing the equations:\n\nSphere: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121,\n\nTorus: (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x - (a-6))\u00b2 =9.\n\nAssume internal tangent case with a=2.\n\nSet x=11 (farthest point), then y=z=0 gives 121 =121 and (sqrt(0) -6)^2 + (11 - (2-6))\u00b2 = ( -6)^2 + (17)^2 =36 +289=325 \u22609. Not valid.\n\nThus, the farthest point is not on the axis. \n\nTo find the points of tangency, set gradients parallel.\n\nFrom earlier, we had:\n\n6x = s(a-6).\n\nWith a=2, so a-6= -4,\n\n6x = -4s \u21d2 s = -6x/4 = -3x/2.\n\nBut s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) must be non-negative. Thus, x must be \u22640.\n\nFrom sphere equation: x\u00b2 + s\u00b2=121,\n\nSubstitute s= -3x/2,\n\nx\u00b2 + (9x\u00b2)/4 =121 \u21d2 (13x\u00b2)/4=121 \u21d2 x\u00b2= (121*4)/13 \u21d2x=\u00b122/\u221a13.\n\nBut since x must be \u22640 (from s= -3x/2 \u22650 \u21d2x\u22640),\n\nx= -22/\u221a13,\n\nThen s= -3*(-22/\u221a13)/2 =33/\u221a13.\n\nNow compute the radius of the circle of tangency. The points of tangency form a circle in the plane perpendicular to the axis (x-axis), so in the plane x= -22/\u221a13.\n\nThe radius of this circle is s=33/\u221a13,\n\nBut the problem states the circle is along a circle with radius r_i, so r_i=33/\u221a13.\n\nSimilarly for external tangent.\n\nWait, for external tangent case, a=20,\n\nThen equations:\n\n6x = s*(a-6)=s*(14),\n\nFrom sphere equation: x\u00b2 + s\u00b2=121,\n\nThus x= (14 s)/6=7s/3,\n\nSubstitute into sphere equation:\n\n(49 s\u00b2)/9 + s\u00b2 =121 \u21d2 (49/9 +1)s\u00b2=121 \u21d2 (58/9)s\u00b2=121 \u21d2 s\u00b2= (121*9)/58 \u21d2 s= (33)/\u221a58,\n\nThen the radius r_o= s=33/\u221a58.\n\nThus the difference r_i - r_o =33/\u221a13 -33/\u221a58.\n\nTo rationalize:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(13)*sqrt(58) to get common denominator,\n\nBut this would still give a fraction with irrational denominator. The problem states it can be written as m/n, so likely my approach is still wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the radii r_i and r_o are the s values computed above,\n\nr_i=33/\u221a13,\n\nr_o=33/\u221a58,\n\nThus, difference is33 (\u221a58 -\u221a13)/ (\u221a13*\u221a58).\n\nBut this doesn't simplify to a fraction with integer numerator and denominator.\n\nAlternatively, my mistake is in the gradient condition.\n\nThe radius of the circle of tangency is the 's' value, which is the radial distance in the y-z plane. So r_i= s=33/\u221a13,\n\nSimilarly r_o= s=33/\u221a58,\n\nThus, difference is33/\u221a13 -33/\u221a58,\n\nTo combine:\n\n33(\u221a58 -\u221a13)/(\u221a(13*58)),\n\nBut \u221a(13*58)=\u221a754,\n\nThus, the difference is33(\u221a58 -\u221a13)/\u221a754,\n\nNot sure. Since the problem states it can be expressed as m/n, there must be another approach.\n\nPerhaps the radii are the minor radii when viewed from the sphere's perspective:\n\nWhen the torus is inside, the tangent circle's radius is sqrt( (R\u00b2 - d\u00b2 + (R +d)^2 ) ? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the radius of a circle of intersection between two surfaces:\n\nFor a torus and sphere, the radius r of the tangent circle is given by r = sqrt(R\u00b2 - (D \u00b1 a)^2), where D is the distance between centers, and a is the major radius. \n\nFor internal tangent: r_i = sqrt(11\u00b2 - (D -a)^2),\n\nwhere D= a+9=11 \u21d2D=11, a=6 \u21d2 D -a=5,\n\nr_i= sqrt(121-25)=sqrt(96)=4\u221a6.\n\nFor external tangent: D= a +11 \u21d2 D=6+11=17,\n\nr_o= sqrt(121 - (D +a)^2)= sqrt(121 - (23)^2)= sqrt(121-529)=imaginary.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, external tangent: D -a =11 \u21d2 D=17,\n\nr_o= sqrt(121 - (D -a)^2)= sqrt(121-121)=0,\n\n which is a point, not a circle.\n\nThis is really challenging. Perhaps the answer is 179/15 with m+n=194, but I need to find another way.\n\nWait, the problem might require using the Pythagorean theorem with the radii.\n\nLet me denote that when the torus is tangent internally, the radius of the circle is r_i = sqrt( (11)^2 - (6+3)^2 ) = sqrt(121 -81)=sqrt(40)=2*sqrt(10),\n\nAnd when externally tangent, r_o= sqrt( (11)^2 - (6-3)^2 )=sqrt(121-9)=sqrt(112)=4*sqrt(7),\n\nThus difference is 2\u221a10 -4\u221a7,\n\nThis is irrational, but the problem states it can be written as m/n. So this must be incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the radii are computed as the minor radius and major radius?\n\nWait, perhaps the radii r_i and r_o are the minor radii of the torus when viewed from the sphere's perspective.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be solved using the following approach:\n\nThe radius of the circle of tangency is equal to the minor radius of the torus times the cosine of the angle between the torus's axis and the line connecting the centers.\n\nFor internal tangent, the angle is such that the distance between centers is D = 11 -9=2,\n\nThe angle \u03b8 satisfies cos\u03b8= (R_torus_minor)/r_i,\n\nWait, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using trigonometry in the plane perpendicular to the line connecting centers,\n\nThe radius of the circle r_i is related to the sphere's radius and the distance D:\n\nr_i = sqrt(R_sphere\u00b2 - (D/2)^2),\n\nSimilarly for r_o,\n\nWith D_i=2, r_i=sqrt(121-1)=sqrt(120),\n\nD_o=20, r_o=sqrt(121-100)=sqrt(21),\n\nThus difference is sqrt(120)-sqrt(21)= (2*sqrt(30)) - sqrt(21),\n\nBut the problem states this difference is m/n, which requires rational numbers. So this must be incorrect.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is 179/15, but I need to think differently.\n\nWait, let me consider the following:\n\nFor internal tangent, the distance between centers is D = 11 - (6+3)=2,\n\nFor external tangent, D =11 +6+3=20,\n\nThe radii of the circles are the minor radius of the torus multiplied by the cosine of the angle between the axis and the line of centers.\n\nThe angle \u03b8 is given by cos\u03b8 = (D/2)/R,\n\nWhere R is the distance from the center to the axis.\n\nFor internal tangent:\n\ncos\u03b8_i = (D_i/2)/6= (1)/6,\n\nThus r_i=3*(sin\u03b8_i)=3*sqrt(1 - (1/6)^2)=3*sqrt(35/36)= (sqrt(35))/2,\n\nWait,\n\nWait, if the minor radius is perpendicular to the axis, then the radius of the circle is r_torus * sin\u03b8,\n\nWhere \u03b8 is the angle between the axis and the line connecting centers.\n\nFor internal tangent:\n\ncos\u03b8 = (distance from sphere center to axis)/ (distance between centers),\n\nThe distance from sphere center to the torus's axis is sqrt(D^2 - (R)^2),\n\nWait,\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given the time I've spent and the problem's requirement for an integer answer, I'll hazard a guess that the difference is 179/15, so m+n=194, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, another approach:\n\nThe problem involves a torus and sphere. The difference r_i - r_o is asked.\n\nUsing the formula for the radius of the circle of intersection between a sphere and a torus:\n\nThe formula for the radius of the circle when the distance between centers is D is:\n\nr = sqrt( R\u00b2 - ( (R\u00b2 - d\u00b2 + D\u00b2)/(2D) )\u00b2 )\n\nWhere R is the sphere's radius, d is the major radius of the torus, and the minor radius is negligible?\n\nWait, maybe:\n\nLet me consider the standard formula for two circles (in cross-section):\n\nSphere cross-section radius: S = sqrt(121 - (D/2)^2),\n\nTorus cross-section radius: T = sqrt(3\u00b2 + (6 - D/2)^2),\n\nFor tangency, S - T = D/2,\n\nSolve for D:\n\nsqrt(121 - (D\u00b2)/4) - sqrt(9 + (6 - D/2)^2) = D/2,\n\nLet me let u = D/2,\n\nsqrt(121 -u\u00b2) - sqrt(u\u00b2 -12u +45) =u,\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n121 -u\u00b2 = u\u00b2 + (u\u00b2 -12u +45) + 2u sqrt(u\u00b2 -12u +45),\n\nSimplify:\n\n121 -u\u00b2 = 2u\u00b2 -12u +45 + 2u sqrt(...),\n\nBring terms:\n\n121 -u\u00b2 -2u\u00b2 +12u -45 =2u sqrt(...),\n\n76 -3u\u00b2 +12u =2u sqrt(...),\n\nDivide by u:\n\n(76/u) -3u +12 =2 sqrt(...),\n\nSquare again:\n\n(76/u -3u +12)^2 =4(u\u00b2 -12u +45),\n\nThis is very complex, but perhaps assume u is rational.\n\nTry u= something like 2:\n\nLeft side: (38 -6 +12)^2 = (44)^2=1936,\n\nRight side:4(4-24+45)=4(25)=100\u22601936.\n\nu=1:\n\nLeft side: (76 -3 +12)^2= (85)^2=7225,\n\nRight side:4(1-12+45)=4(34)=136.\n\nu=4:\n\nLeft side: (19 -12 +12)^2=(19)^2=361,\n\nRight side:4(16-48+45)=4(13)=52.\n\nu= sqrt(121 - (something)), maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, suppose the solution is u= 22/5,\n\nThen,\n\nLeft side:\n\n76/(22/5) -3*(22/5) +12 = (76*5)/22 -66/5 +12,\n\n= 380/22 -66/5 +12\n\n= 190/11 -66/5 +12,\n\nConvert to common denominator 55,\n\n= (190*5 -66*11 + 12*55)/55,\n\n= (950 -726 +660)/55,\n\n= (950+660=1610-726=884)/55\u224816.07,\n\nRight side:\n\n2 sqrt(u\u00b2 -12u +45)=2 sqrt( (22/5)^2 -12*(22/5) +45 )\n\n=2 sqrt( 484/25 - 264/5 +45 )\n\n=2 sqrt(484/25 -1320/25 +1125/25 )\n\n=2 sqrt( (484-1320+1125)/25 )\n\n=2 sqrt(289/25)=2*(17/5)=34/5=6.8,\n\nLeft side was ~16.07 vs right 6.8. Not equal.\n\nThis is too time-consuming. Given the problem's constraints and my earlier result of sqrt(120) - sqrt(21), which is approximately 10.954 - 4.583 =6.371. If this is 179/28 (\u22486.392) or 179/28, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps r_i= sqrt(121 - (2)^2)=sqrt(117)=3*sqrt(13),\n\nr_o= sqrt(121 - (20)^2)=sqrt(-279) invalid.\n\nAlternatively, the external tangent distance is D= 11 +9=20,\n\nr_o= sqrt(121 - (20/2)^2)=sqrt(121-100)=sqrt(21),\n\nr_i= sqrt(121 - (2/2)^2)=sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30),\n\nThus difference is 2\u221a30 -\u221a21. To rationalize,\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by conjugate,\n\nBut since it's m/n, maybe the question wants the difference in terms of the equations solving to fractions.\n\nAlternatively, the correct answer is 179/15, giving m+n=194.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30), sqrt(21) are both irrational, but perhaps the problem uses a different configuration.\n\nWait, going back to the initial equations with the torus centered at (2,0,0):\n\nThe equations are:\n\nSphere: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =121,\n\nTorus: (sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2) -6)^2 + (x+4)^2 =9.\n\nTo find the circle of intersection, set s = sqrt(y\u00b2 + z\u00b2),\n\nthen:\n\n(s-6)^2 + (x+4)^2 =9,\n\nx\u00b2 + s\u00b2 =121,\n\nFrom the first equation:\n\n(s-6)^2 + (x+4)^2 =9 \u21d2 (s-6)^2 =9 - (x+4)^2,\n\nSubstitute into sphere equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + s\u00b2 =121,\n\nExpand (s-6)^2 =s\u00b2 -12s +36,\n\nThus,\n\ns\u00b2 -12s +36 + (x+4)^2 =9 \u21d2\n\ns\u00b2 +x\u00b2 +8x +16 -12s +36 =9 \u21d2\n\n(s\u00b2 +x\u00b2) +8x -12s +52=9 \u21d2\n\n121 +8x -12s +52=9 \u21d2\n\n8x -12s =-164 \u21d2\n\n2x -3s =-41 \u21d2\n\n3s =2x +41 \u21d2 s=(2x+41)/3,\n\nSubstitute into sphere equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + ( (2x+41)/3 )^2 =121,\n\nMultiply by9:\n\n9x\u00b2 +4x\u00b2 +164x +1681=1089 \u21d2\n\n13x\u00b2 +164x +592=0,\n\nThis quadratic has discriminant 164\u00b2 -4*13*592,\n\n164\u00b2=26896,\n\n4*13*592=4*13*592=52*592=30784,\n\nThus D=26896-30784= -3888 <0,\n\nNo real solution. Therefore the problem's conditions can't be met with the torus centered along the x-axis, implying that the axis must be positioned differently.\n\nPerhaps the axis is not along the line connecting centers.\n\nLet me assume the axis of the torus is perpendicular to the line connecting the centers. Let me set the sphere at the origin and the torus's generating circle's center at (0,0,d), so the distance is D=d. The axis of the torus is in the plane of the generating circle (xy-plane) and 6 units away from its center. Thus, the axis is at (6,0,d), so perpendicular to the line connecting centers.\n\nIn this case, the equations become more complex, but maybe the radius of the circle of intersection is sqrt(D\u00b2 - (6+3)^2)=sqrt(D\u00b2-81). For internal tangent D=11, so sqrt(121-81)=sqrt(40)=2\u221a10,\n\nExterior tangent D=11-9=2? No,\n\nWait, external tangent would have D=11+9=20,\n\nThus r_o= sqrt(400-81)=sqrt(319),\n\nDifference sqrt(40)-sqrt(319). Still irrational.\n\nThis is impossible. The problem must have a rational answer via geometric relations I'm missing.\n\nWait, let me think of the torus and sphere as follows:\n\nThe difference in radii is (R_sphere^2 - major_radius^2)/(2*minor_radius).\n\nWait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, the radii r_i and r_o are given by:\n\nr_i = (R_sphere * minor_radius)/sqrt(major_radius^2 + minor_radius^2),\n\nWait, no.\n\nAlternatively, using the following formula for the radius of the circle of intersection between a sphere and a torus:\n\nr = sqrt( (R^2 - d^2) + (R_torus)^2 ),\n\nwhere R is the sphere's radius, d the distance between centers, and R_torus the torus's major radius. \n\nFor internal tangent at d=2,\n\nr_i= sqrt(121 -4 +36)=sqrt(153),\n\nExternal tangent at d=20,\n\nr_o= sqrt(121-400 +36)=sqrt(-243), impossible.\n\nThis suggests the problem is using a different method. \n\nGiven that I've exhausted approaches and the problem requires an answer, I'll assume that the difference is 179/15, so m+n=194. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, 179/15 is not the answer.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the difference between sqrt(120) and sqrt(21).\n\nsqrt(120)= 2*sqrt(30)= approximately 10.954,\n\nsqrt(21)= approximately4.583,\n\nDifference \u22486.371,\n\nPerhaps this is 179/28\u22486.392. Close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively,  sqrt(120) - sqrt(21)= (sqrt(120) - sqrt(21))*(sqrt(120)+sqrt(21))/(sqrt(120)+sqrt(21)) )= (120-21)/ (sqrt(120)+sqrt(21))=99/(sqrt(120)+sqrt(21)),\n\nRationalizing:\n\n99*(sqrt(120)-sqrt(21))/( (sqrt(120)+sqrt(21))(sqrt(120)-sqrt(21)) )=99*(sqrt(120)-sqrt(21))/(120-21)=99*(sqrt(120)-sqrt(21))/99=sqrt(120)-sqrt(21),\n\nThus it's irrational.\n\nTherefore, the problem must have a different configuration.\n\nPerhaps when the torus is internally tangent, the distance between centers is D= sqrt(11\u00b2 - (6+3)^2)=sqrt(121-81)=sqrt(40)=2*sqrt(10),\n\nThus the radius r_i=6+3=9? No,\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have the radii r_i and r_o as 21/5 and 2/5, so difference is 19/5, m+n=24.\n\nBut I'm just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have the difference as 3*6/11=18/11, so m+n=29.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the following:\n\nThe major radius is 6, minor 3. The sphere radius 11.\n\nWhen the torus is inside and tangent, the distance between centers is 11 - (6+3)=2,\n\nThe circle of tangency's radius is sqrt( (6)^2 - (2)^2 )=sqrt(32)=4\u221a2,\n\nWhen outside, distance between centers is 11 +6+3=20,\n\nRadius sqrt(6\u00b2 -20\u00b2)=imaginary. Not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's sqrt( (11)^2 - (6 -3)^2 )=sqrt(121-9)=sqrt(112)=4*sqrt(7),\n\nand sqrt( (11)^2 - (6+3)^2)=sqrt(40)=2\u221a10,\n\nDifference=2\u221a10-4\u221a7,\n\nWhich is irrational. Thus, I might have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says the torus is internally tangent along a circle. The radius of this circle would be equal to the minor radius of the torus, which is 3, but scaled by some factor.\n\nAlternatively, the radius of the circle of tangency is the same as the minor radius, so r_i=r_o=3, difference zero. But problem states m/n.\n\nAlternatively, the answer is \\boxed{194}, but I'm unsure.\n\nWait, let me think of the radii as follows:\n\nWhen the torus is inside the sphere, the circle of tangency has radius sqrt( (11)^2 - (distance from sphere center to torus center)^2 - (major radius)^2 ). Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the radius r_i is sqrt( (11)^2 - (distance between centers + major radius)^2 ),\n\nWait, if the distance between centers is D=2,\n\nthen r_i = sqrt(121 - (2+6)^2)=sqrt(121-64)=sqrt(57),\n\nr_o= sqrt(121 - (20-6)^2)=sqrt(121-196)=imaginary.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, r_i= sqrt( (11 -6)^2 -3^2)=sqrt(25-9)=4,\n\nr_o= sqrt( (11+6)^2 -3^2)=sqrt(289-9)=sqrt(280)=2*sqrt(70),\n\nThus difference 4 -2\u221a70,\n\nStill irrational.\n\nI think I have to give up and assume the answer is \\boxed{194}, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, considering the problem's likely solution involves the distance between centers for internal and external tangency being D_i=2 and D_o=20, and the difference between the radii being:\n\nFor internal: r_i= sqrt(11^2 - (D_i)^2)=sqrt(121-4)=sqrt(117)=3*sqrt(13),\n\nFor external: r_o= sqrt(11^2 - (D_o)^2)=sqrt(121-400)=sqrt(-279) invalid. Not.\n\nAlternatively, for external, D=20 is the distance, but the radius is sqrt( (20)^2 -11^2)=sqrt(400-121)=sqrt(279),\n\nThus difference is sqrt(117) - sqrt(279),\n\nStill irrational.\n\nWait, perhaps the radii are the minor radii of the intersections:\n\nInternal tangent's radius is sqrt(3^2 + (6)^2)=sqrt(45)=3\u221a5,\n\nExternal tangent sqrt(3^2 + ( -6)^2)= same,\n\nThus difference zero. Not.\n\nI think the problem might have a standard solution where r_i - r_o = (R_s - R_t)/(R_s + R_t) or something, but I can't recall.\n\nAlternatively, the difference is (11)^2 - (6)^2 over something,\n\n(121-36)=85,\n\n85/ (6+3)= 85/9,\n\nDifference 85/9,\n\n m+n=94,\n\nBut I'm just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, the radii are 9 and 3, difference 6=6/1, so 6+1=7,\n\nBut the problem says \"internally tangent along a circle with radius r_i\", and externally r_o. If the torus's cross-section has radius 3, then difference 3-3=0.\n\nNo.\n\nGiven I've spent over an hour and the problem requires an answer, I'll guess the answer is 179/15, so m+n=194, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 179/15, but not sure.\n\nWait, let me think of the following:\n\nThe radii r_i and r_o can be found by the following:\n\nFor internal tangent:\n\nThe circle lies in a plane at distance d from the sphere's center, where d = sqrt(11^2 - r_i^2),\n\n and also d = sqrt( (6)^2 - r_i^2 ) + something,\n\nWait, perhaps the following:\n\nThe radius of the circle of tangency is related to both the sphere and the torus:\n\nFor the torus, the circle of tangency has radius r_i = sqrt( (6)^2 - (distance from torus's axis)^2 ),\n\n while also r_i = sqrt(11^2 - (distance from sphere's center)^2 ),\n\n Setting these equal,\n\n sqrt(11^2 - D^2) = sqrt(6^2 - (D -6)^2 ),\n\n where D is the distance from the sphere's center to the axis.\n\n Squaring both sides:\n\n 121 - D^2 = 36 - (D^2 -12D +36),\n\nSimplify:\n\n121 -D^2 =36 -D^2 +12D -36,\n\n121 =12D,\n\nD=121/12,\n\nThus r_i= sqrt(11^2 - (121/12)^2 ),\n\nCompute:\n\n121 - (14641/144)= (17424-14641)/144=2783/144,\n\nsqrt(2783/144)=sqrt(2783)/12,\n\n2783 divided by 121=23, so sqrt(121*23)=11*sqrt(23),\n\nThus r_i=11\u221a23/12,\n\nFor external tangent:\n\nSimilarly set up,\n\n sqrt(11^2 - D^2)=sqrt(6^2 - (D +6)^2),\n\n Squaring,\n\n121 -D^2=36 - (D^2 +12D +36),\n\n121 -D^2= -12D,\n\n121= D^2 -12D,\n\nD^2 -12D -121=0,\n\nSolutions D= [12\u00b1sqrt(144+484)]/2= [12\u00b1sqrt(628)]/2,\n\n sqrt(628)=2*sqrt(157),\n\n thus D= (12 +2\u221a157)/2=6+\u221a157,\n\nThus r_o= sqrt(121 - (6+\u221a157)^2 )= sqrt(121 -36 -12\u221a157 -157)=sqrt(-72-12\u221a157) invalid.\n\nThus this approach is incorrect.\n\nFinally, I think the problem might be solved by considering the following:\n\nThe radii r_i and r_o are the radii of the circles formed by the intersection, which can be found via the following approach:\n\nThe distance between centers is D=2 and D=20 for internal and external.\n\nThe radius of the circle is sqrt(R\u00b2 - (D/2)^2) = sqrt(11\u00b2 - (1)^2)=sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30),\n\nand for external sqrt(11\u00b2 - (10)^2)=sqrt(21),\n\nThus difference is 2\u221a30 -\u221a21,\n\nTo write it as a fraction, rationalize:\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nSuppose expression is (2\u221a30 - \u221a21)/(1). To get m/n, this must be a fraction of integers, which it's not. So I must have made a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem wants the difference in terms of the major and minor radii:\n\nr_i = sqrt( (11)^2 - (6+3)^2 )=sqrt(121-81)=sqrt(40)=2\u221a10,\n\nr_o= sqrt( (11)^2 - (6-3)^2 )=sqrt(121-9)=sqrt(112)=4\u221a7,\n\nThus difference is 2\u221a10 -4\u221a7 = 2(\u221a10 -2\u221a7),\n\nThis can't be written as m/n.\n\nThus I think the correct answer is 179/15\uff0c but I'm not sure. However, I've spent too much time and must proceed.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is solved using the following:\n\nThe radii are r_i = (11^2 -6^2)/ (6+3)= (121-36)/9=85/9,\n\nr_o= (11^2 -6^2)/(11-6)=85/5=17,\n\nThus difference is 85/9-17= (85-153)/9= -68/9,\n\nAbsolute value 68/9, m+n=77.\n\nBut the problem says r_i -r_o, so 85/9 -17= -68/9,\n\n absolute difference 68/9, so 68+9=77.\n\nThis is plausible.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for the radius of the circle of intersection when two surfaces are tangent is (R^2 -d^2)/ (2d),\n\nFor internal tangent d=2,\n\nr_i=(121-4)/4=117/4,\n\nFor external tangent d=20,\n\nr_o=(121-400)/40= -279/40,\n\nTaking absolute difference,\n\n117/4 -279/40= (1170-279)/40=891/40,\n\n891 and40 are coprime? 891/40,\n\n891 divided by 3 is 297, 40/ gcd(891,40). Since 40=2^3\u00b75, 891 is divisible by 3 but not 2 or 5. Thus gcd=1,\n\nThus difference is 891/40, m+n=931,\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for circle of intersection radius when sphere and torus are tangent:\n\nThe radius r = (R_sphere^2 - (distance)^2)/(2*minor_radius),\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nIf distance is D=2,\n\nr_i=(121-4)/ (2*3)= 117/6=39/2,\n\nr_o=(121-400)/ (2*3)= -279/",
