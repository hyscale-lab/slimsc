      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is asking for the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A b-eautiful number is defined as a positive integer n that has exactly two digits when written in base b, and the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A two-digit number in base b would be represented as \"d1 d2\" where d1 is the digit in the higher place (the \"b's place\") and d2 is the units digit. Since it's a two-digit number, the value of n in base 10 is d1*b + d2. The digits d1 and d2 must satisfy 0 \u2264 d1, d2 < b, and since it's a two-digit number, d1 can't be zero. So d1 is between 1 and b-1, and d2 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nThe key condition here is that the sum of the digits, d1 + d2, must equal the square root of n. So, mathematically, that gives us the equation:\n\nd1 + d2 = \u221a(d1*b + d2)\n\nOur goal is to find for each base b, how many such numbers n exist, and then find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me try to formalize this equation. Let me denote S = d1 + d2. Then according to the problem, S = \u221a(n) = \u221a(d1*b + d2). Squaring both sides gives S\u00b2 = d1*b + d2. But since S is d1 + d2, substituting that in, we have:\n\n(d1 + d2)\u00b2 = d1*b + d2\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2\u00b2 = d1*b + d2\n\nLet me rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:\n\nd1\u00b2 + 2*d1*d2 + d2\u00b2 - d1*b - d2 = 0\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way to approach this. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since S = d1 + d2 and S\u00b2 = d1*b + d2, perhaps I can express d2 in terms of S and d1. Let's see:\n\nFrom S = d1 + d2, so d2 = S - d1.\n\nSubstituting into the equation S\u00b2 = d1*b + d2 gives:\n\nS\u00b2 = d1*b + (S - d1)  \nS\u00b2 = d1*b + S - d1  \nLet me factor terms with d1:\n\nS\u00b2 - S = d1*(b - 1) + d1*b? Wait, no. Let me re-express that:\n\nWait, S\u00b2 = d1*b + S - d1  \nSo, S\u00b2 - S = d1*(b - 1)  \nTherefore, d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, that seems useful. Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, and d2 = S - d1 must also be an integer between 0 and b-1, inclusive, we can use this equation to find possible values of S and d1 for a given b.\n\nAlternatively, since S is the sum of the digits, which are both non-negative integers, S must be at least 1 (since d1 is at least 1) and at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. However, since S squared is equal to n, which is a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number, 10 in base b which is 1*b + 0 = b) and b\u00b2 - 1 (the largest two-digit number, (b-1)(b-1) in base b which is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 - 1). Therefore, n is between b and b\u00b2 -1, so sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b\u00b2 - 1) \u2248 b. \n\nTherefore, the square root of n must be between sqrt(b) and b. Since S is the square root, S must be an integer between ceiling(sqrt(b)) and floor(b). However, since S is the sum of two digits, each at most b-1, so the maximum S can be is (b-1)+(b-1)=2b-2. But since S squared must be less than b\u00b2 (since n is less than b\u00b2), so S must be less than b. Wait, that's a contradiction unless S is at most b-1. Because n is less than b\u00b2, so sqrt(n) < b. Therefore, S must be less than b. Therefore, S can be from 1 up to b-1. But actually, since n is at least b, sqrt(n) is at least sqrt(b). So S must be an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each base b, the possible values of S are integers S where ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 S \u2264 b-1. For each such S, we can compute d1 as (S\u00b2 - S)/(b - 1), and check if that gives an integer d1 between 1 and b-1, and then check if d2 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of this equation again:\n\nd1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b - 1)\n\nSo, since d1 must be an integer, (S\u00b2 - S) must be divisible by (b - 1). So, (b - 1) divides (S\u00b2 - S). Let me note that S\u00b2 - S = S(S - 1). Therefore, (b - 1) divides S(S - 1). Since S and S - 1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, (b - 1) must divide the product S(S - 1), and since they are coprime, (b - 1) must divide either S or S - 1, or a combination where factors are split between them. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is getting too abstract. Maybe it's better to set up the equation and see for each possible S, what conditions on b must hold for d1 to be an integer in the required range, and d2 also valid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can rearrange terms differently. Let me try to write the equation again:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + d2, and S = d1 + d2. So substituting d2 = S - d1 into the first equation:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + (S - d1)  \nS^2 = d1*(b - 1) + S  \nThen, rearranged:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S  \nSo,\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, the numerator must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be between 1 and b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each S in the possible range (ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1), we can check if (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b - 1), and then compute d1, and check if d2 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of this as for each S, there's a possible d1 given by that equation, and then check the constraints on d2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express b in terms of S and d1. Let me see:\n\nFrom the equation:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S  \n=> b -1 = (S^2 - S)/d1  \n=> b = (S^2 - S)/d1 + 1\n\nSince b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, this tells us that (S^2 - S) must be divisible by d1, and then b is computed accordingly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe this approach is more helpful for a given S and d1, but since we are trying to find for each b, the number of such n, perhaps we need another angle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to fix b and then iterate over possible S values to count the number of solutions.\n\nLet me think of the steps required:\n\n1. For a given b, the possible S (sum of digits) must satisfy ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 S \u2264 b -1. Because sqrt(n) must be at least sqrt(b) (since n is at least b) and less than b (since n is less than b\u00b2).\n\n2. For each S in that range, we can compute d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1). Then check if d1 is an integer between 1 and b-1, and then check if d2 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\n3. If both conditions are satisfied, then that S corresponds to a valid two-digit number in base b, so that's one b-beautiful number.\n\n4. The total count is the number of such S values (for each S in the valid range, if the above conditions hold, it counts as one).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to, for each b starting from 2 upwards, compute how many S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] satisfy that (S\u00b2 - S) is divisible by (b -1), and when you compute d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b-1), then d2 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1.\n\nTherefore, perhaps we can proceed as follows:\n\nFirst, note that d2 must be non-negative, so S - d1 \u2265 0. Since d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1), then:\n\nS - (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2265 0  \nMultiply both sides by (b -1) (assuming b >1, which it is):\n\nS(b -1) - (S\u00b2 - S) \u22650  \nSb - S - S\u00b2 + S \u22650  \nSb - S\u00b2 \u22650  \nS(b - S) \u22650\n\nSince S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, so S is less than b, so (b - S) is positive. Since S is positive, the product is positive. Therefore, that inequality is automatically satisfied. So d2 is non-negative.\n\nSimilarly, d2 must be less than b. So:\n\nS - d1 < b  \n=> S - (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) < b  \nAgain, multiply both sides by (b -1):\n\n(S)(b -1) - (S\u00b2 - S) < b(b -1)  \nSb - S - S\u00b2 + S < b\u00b2 - b  \nSb - S\u00b2 < b\u00b2 - b  \nRearranged:\n\n- S\u00b2 + Sb < b\u00b2 - b  \nMultiply both sides by -1 (inequality reverses):\n\nS\u00b2 - Sb > -b\u00b2 + b  \nS\u00b2 - Sb + b\u00b2 - b >0  \nHmm, not sure if this is helpful. Let's see:\n\nAlternatively, let's see:\n\nStarting from S - d1 < b,\n\nd1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1)\n\nThus,\n\nS - (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) < b\n\nLet me compute the left-hand side:\n\nLet me write it as [S(b -1) - (S\u00b2 - S)]/(b -1) < b\n\nNumerator:\n\nS(b -1) - S\u00b2 + S = Sb - S - S\u00b2 + S = Sb - S\u00b2\n\nThus,\n\n(Sb - S\u00b2)/(b -1) < b  \nMultiply both sides by (b -1):\n\nSb - S\u00b2 < b(b -1)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nSb - S\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + b <0  \nFactor:\n\n- S\u00b2 + Sb - b\u00b2 + b <0  \nMultiply by -1 (reverse inequality):\n\nS\u00b2 - Sb + b\u00b2 - b >0  \nHmm, not sure. Let me plug in numbers here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe this is getting too involved. Since d2 = S - d1 = S - (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1). Let me compute d2:\n\nd2 = [ S(b -1) - S\u00b2 + S ] / (b -1)  \nWait, let me do that again:\n\nd2 = S - [ (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) ]\n\n= [ S(b -1) - (S\u00b2 - S) ] / (b -1 )\n\n= [ Sb - S - S\u00b2 + S ] / (b -1 )\n\n= [ Sb - S\u00b2 ] / (b -1 )\n\nThus,\n\nd2 = [ S(b - S) ] / (b -1 )\n\nSince d2 must be less than b,\n\n[ S(b - S) ] / (b -1 ) < b\n\nMultiply both sides by (b -1):\n\nS(b - S) < b(b -1 )\n\nWhich is the same as before. Let me rearrange:\n\nS(b - S) < b\u00b2 - b\n\nLet me note that S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of getting bogged down in algebra, we can note that since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, then (S\u00b2 - S) must be divisible by (b -1). Therefore, for each S in the valid range, if (S\u00b2 - S) mod (b -1) =0, then we can compute d1 and d2.\n\nTherefore, the number of b-beautiful numbers for a given b is equal to the number of integers S between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 such that (S\u00b2 - S) is divisible by (b -1).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the smallest b \u22652 such that the number of S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where (S\u00b2 - S) mod (b-1)=0 is greater than 10.\n\nHmm. So perhaps we can approach this by trying to find for each b, how many S satisfy the divisibility condition. Since this might take a while, maybe we can find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, note that (S\u00b2 - S) = S(S -1). So, (b -1) divides S(S-1). Since S and S-1 are coprime, as they are consecutive integers, then (b -1) must divide either S or S-1, or split the factors between them.\n\nSo, (b -1) divides S(S-1). Since gcd(S, S-1)=1, then (b -1) must divide S or (b -1) divides (S -1), or factors of (b-1) are split between S and S-1. \n\nTherefore, either:\n\nCase 1: (b -1) divides S, so S = k*(b -1) for some integer k. Since S must be \u2264 b-1, then k can only be 1. Therefore, S = b -1. \n\nThen check if S = b-1 is within the valid range (ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 S \u2264 b-1). Since S = b-1 is the upper limit, so yes. \n\nThen in this case, substituting S = b-1 into d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) = [(b-1)^2 - (b-1)]/(b-1) = [ (b-1)(b-2) ] / (b-1) ) = b - 2. \n\nThen d2 = S - d1 = (b-1) - (b-2) = 1. \n\nSo d2 is 1, which is between 0 and b-1. So this is always a valid solution when S = b-1. Therefore, for every b, there is at least one solution with S = b -1. \n\nCase 2: (b -1) divides (S -1). So S -1 = m*(b -1) for some integer m. Then S = 1 + m*(b-1). Since S must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)), and at most b-1, let's see possible m.\n\nSince S \u2264 b -1, then 1 + m*(b-1) \u2264 b -1 \u21d2 m*(b-1) \u2264 b -2 \u21d2 m \u2264 (b-2)/(b-1) <1. Since m must be a non-negative integer, the only possibility is m=0, leading to S=1. But S must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)), which is at least 2 when b \u22652. So this case only gives S=1, which is too small. So this case doesn't contribute any valid S except possibly when b=2. Let me check b=2:\n\nFor b=2, ceil(sqrt(2)) is 2, so S must be between 2 and 1, which is impossible. Wait, actually, for b=2, the two-digit numbers go from 2 (10_2) up to 3 (11_2). sqrt(n) must be an integer. For n=2, sqrt(2) is not integer. n=3, sqrt(3) is not integer. So no solutions for b=2, which aligns with the fact that the first case S=b-1=1 is invalid here.\n\nTherefore, Case 2 doesn't give any valid solutions except perhaps when m=0, but that leads to S=1, which is too low for b \u22652.\n\nTherefore, the only guaranteed solution is when S = b-1, giving one solution. So, to have more than 10 solutions, we need other S values where (b-1) divides S(S-1) but not necessarily dividing S or S-1 alone.\n\nTherefore, the other solutions must come from cases where (b -1) divides S(S-1), but neither divides S nor S-1 individually. That is, (b -1) must have factors that divide S and factors that divide S-1. Since S and S-1 are coprime, the factors must be split between them. So for example, if (b-1) factors into two coprime numbers, say d1 and d2, where d1 divides S and d2 divides S-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the equation:\n\nLet me denote k = b -1. Then the condition becomes k divides S(S-1). We need to find the number of S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that k divides S(S-1). Since k = b-1, so we can rephrase everything in terms of k. Let me set k = b -1, so b = k +1. Then the range of S is ceil(sqrt(k+1)) \u2264 S \u2264 k. \n\nWe need to count the number of integers S between ceil(sqrt(k+1)) and k such that k divides S(S-1). Then, we need to find the smallest k+1 (i.e., b) such that this count exceeds 10. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal k (since b =k +1) where the number of S in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] with k | S(S-1) is greater than 10. \n\nHmm, perhaps this substitution helps. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, let's note that S(S-1) \u2261 0 mod k. Since S and S-1 are coprime, the factors of k must be partitioned between S and S-1. Let me denote that S \u2261 0 mod d and S \u22611 mod (k/d), where d divides k. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but this might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of S mod k and S-1 mod k. Since their product must be 0 mod k, so either S \u22610 mod p or S \u22611 mod p for each prime power dividing k. But this might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of getting too abstract, we can consider that S and S-1 must cover all the prime factors of k between them. Since they are consecutive integers, they are coprime, so each prime factor of k must divide exactly one of S or S-1. Therefore, the number of solutions S is equal to the number of integers S in the interval [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that for each prime power p^e dividing k, p^e divides S or p^e divides S-1. \n\nBut this still seems complicated. Maybe let's think of specific values of k (i.e., b-1) and see how many solutions there are.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that S(S-1) \u22610 mod k. Let me think of S as variable, and for each k, count how many S in the given range satisfy that equation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers S in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that S \u22610 mod d or S\u22611 mod d, where d is a divisor? Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of k? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the equation S(S-1) \u22610 mod k can be written as S^2 \u2261 S mod k. So we are looking for solutions S in that interval where S^2 \u2261 S mod k. These are called \"idempotents\" modulo k. The number of solutions to S\u00b2 \u2261 S mod k is equal to 2^m, where m is the number of distinct prime factors of k. But wait, that's when considering all residues modulo k, but here we have a restricted range. However, perhaps this can give some intuition.\n\nWait, actually, the equation S\u00b2 \u2261 S mod k implies that S(S - 1) \u22610 mod k. Since S and S-1 are coprime, the solutions are numbers S such that S \u22610 mod p_i^e or S\u22611 mod p_i^e for each prime power in the factorization of k. The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that the number of solutions mod k is 2^t, where t is the number of distinct prime factors of k. However, this is the total number of solutions mod k. However, in our case, we are only considering S in the range [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k], so the total number could be up to 2^t, but depending on the value of k and the range.\n\nWait, but this might not directly apply here because our interval is not the entire range mod k, but a specific interval. So perhaps the number of solutions in the interval could be roughly proportional to 2^t. Therefore, to get more than 10 solutions, we need 2^t >10, so t>3 or t=4 (since 2^4=16). So maybe when k has at least 4 distinct prime factors, but this is just a rough idea.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of k? Not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let's try small values of k and see the number of solutions, then see when it exceeds 10.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, so maybe trying for k from 1 upwards (since b starts at 2, so k =1, 2,...) and compute the number of solutions for each k until we find one where the count is over 10.\n\nBut this might take a while, but perhaps manageable for small k. Let me try.\n\nFirst, note that k = b-1, so we can start with k=1 (b=2), but let's see:\n\nWait, let me make a table.\n\nStarting with k=1 (b=2):\n\nThe range of S is ceil(sqrt(2))=2, but since k=1, the upper limit is k=1. So the interval [2,1], which is empty. So 0 solutions. So b=2: 0.\n\nk=2 (b=3):\n\nsqrt(3)\u22481.732, ceil is 2. So S must be between 2 and 2 (since k=2, upper limit is 2). So S=2.\n\nCheck if 2 divides S(S-1)=2*1=2. Yes, 2 divides 2. So that works. So count is 1. So b=3 has 1.\n\nk=3 (b=4):\n\nsqrt(4)=2, so ceil is 2. S must be between 2 and 3.\n\nCheck S=2 and 3.\n\nFor S=2: 3 divides 2*1=2? 2 mod 3 \u22600. No.\n\nFor S=3: 3 divides 3*2=6. Yes. So only S=3. So count 1. Thus b=4 has 1.\n\nk=4 (b=5):\n\nsqrt(5)\u22482.236, ceil is 3. S from 3 to 4.\n\nCheck S=3 and 4.\n\nFor S=3: 4 divides 3*2=6? 6 mod4=2\u22600. No.\n\nS=4: 4 divides 4*3=12. 12 mod4=0. Yes. So count 1. b=5:1.\n\nk=5 (b=6):\n\nsqrt(6)\u22482.449, ceil is 3. S from 3 to 5.\n\nCheck S=3,4,5:\n\nS=3:5 divides 3*2=6? 6 mod5=1\u22600.\n\nS=4:5 divides4*3=12? 12 mod5=2\u22600.\n\nS=5:5 divides5*4=20. 20 mod5=0. Yes. So count 1. b=6:1.\n\nHmm, same pattern so far.\n\nk=6 (b=7):\n\nsqrt(7)\u22482.645, ceil is 3. S from 3 to6.\n\nCheck S=3,4,5,6:\n\nS=3: 6 divides 3*2=6 \u2192 yes. So S=3: yes.\n\nS=4:6 divides4*3=12 \u2192 yes (12/6=2). So yes.\n\nS=5:6 divides5*4=20 \u2192 20 mod6=2\u22600.\n\nS=6:6 divides6*5=30 \u2192 yes. So S=3,4,6 \u2192 count 3.\n\nThus for b=7 (k=6), count is 3.\n\nOkay, so that's the first time the count increases beyond 1. Let me note that down.\n\nContinuing:\n\nk=7 (b=8):\n\nsqrt(8)=2.828, ceil is 3. S from 3 to7.\n\nCheck S=3,4,5,6,7:\n\nS=3:7 divides3*2=6 \u2192 6 mod7\u22600.\n\nS=4:7 divides4*3=12 \u219212 mod7=5\u22600.\n\nS=5:7 divides5*4=20 \u219220 mod7=6\u22600.\n\nS=6:7 divides6*5=30 \u219230 mod7=2\u22600.\n\nS=7:7 divides7*6=42 \u219242 mod7=0. So only S=7. Count=1.\n\nHmm, so back to 1.\n\nk=8 (b=9):\n\nsqrt(9)=3, so ceil is 3. S from 3 to8.\n\nCheck S=3 to8:\n\nS=3:8 divides3*2=6 \u2192 no.\n\nS=4:8 divides4*3=12 \u219212 mod8=4\u22600.\n\nS=5:8 divides5*4=20 \u219220 mod8=4\u22600.\n\nS=6:8 divides6*5=30 \u219230 mod8=6\u22600.\n\nS=7:8 divides7*6=42 \u219242 mod8=2\u22600.\n\nS=8:8 divides8*7=56 \u2192 yes. So count=1. b=9:1.\n\nk=9 (b=10):\n\nsqrt(10)\u22483.16, ceil=4. S from4 to9.\n\nCheck S=4,5,6,7,8,9:\n\nS=4:9 divides4*3=12 \u219212 mod9=3\u22600.\n\nS=5:9 divides5*4=20 \u219220 mod9=2\u22600.\n\nS=6:9 divides6*5=30 \u219230 mod9=3\u22600.\n\nS=7:9 divides7*6=42 \u219242 mod9=6\u22600.\n\nS=8:9 divides8*7=56 \u219256 mod9=2\u22600.\n\nS=9:9 divides9*8=72 \u2192 yes. So count=1. b=10:1.\n\nHmm. Let's see k=10 (b=11):\n\nsqrt(11)=3.316, ceil=4. S from4 to10.\n\nCheck S=4 to10:\n\nS=4:10 divides4*3=12 \u219212 mod10=2\u22600.\n\nS=5:10 divides5*4=20 \u219220 mod10=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nS=6:10 divides6*5=30 \u219230 mod10=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nS=7:10 divides7*6=42 \u219242 mod10=2\u22600.\n\nS=8:10 divides8*7=56 \u219256 mod10=6\u22600.\n\nS=9:10 divides9*8=72 \u219272 mod10=2\u22600.\n\nS=10:10 divides10*9=90 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus S=5,6,10 \u2192 count=3. So b=11 has 3.\n\nHmm, similar to k=6.\n\nContinuing:\n\nk=12 (b=13):\n\nWait, let's skip ahead a bit. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nWait, maybe when k is composite, especially with more factors, we can get more solutions. For instance, when k=6 (b=7), which factors into 2\u00d73, we had 3 solutions. Let me see k=12 (b=13):\n\nsqrt(13)\u22483.605, so ceil=4. S from4 to12.\n\nWe need to check S from4 to12 where 12 divides S(S-1).\n\nSo S(S-1) must be divisible by 12.\n\nLet me list S from4 to12:\n\nS=4: 4\u00d73=12 \u2192 divisible by12 \u2192 yes.\n\nS=5:5\u00d74=20 \u219220 mod12=8\u22600.\n\nS=6:6\u00d75=30 mod12=6\u22600.\n\nS=7:7\u00d76=42 mod12=6\u22600.\n\nS=8:8\u00d77=56 mod12= 56-48=8\u22600.\n\nS=9:9\u00d78=72 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nS=10:10\u00d79=90 mod12= 90-72=18 mod12=6\u22600.\n\nS=11:11\u00d710=110 mod12= 110-96=14 mod12=2\u22600.\n\nS=12:12\u00d711=132 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the valid S are 4,9,12 \u2192 count 3.\n\nHmm. So 3 solutions again.\n\nHmm. Let me try k=15 (b=16):\n\nsqrt(16)=4, so S from4 to15.\n\nWe need S(S-1) divisible by15.\n\n15 factors into 3\u00d75. So S(S-1) divisible by3 and5.\n\nThus, either S divisible by3 or S-1 divisible by3,\n\nAND S divisible by5 or S-1 divisible by5.\n\nSo the number of solutions is the number of S in [4,15] such that:\n\n(S mod3=0 or S mod3=1) AND (S mod5=0 or S mod5=1)\n\nWait, actually, to have S(S-1) divisible by3, either S\u22610 mod3 or S\u22611 mod3 (since if S\u22610 mod3 then 3 divides S, else if S\u22611 mod3 then 3 divides S-1). Similarly for 5.\n\nThus, the solutions are numbers S where (S mod3 is 0 or 1) AND (S mod5 is 0 or 1).\n\nTherefore, the count is the number of S in [4,15] where S mod3 is 0 or1 AND S mod5 is 0 or1.\n\nLet me list S from4 to15 and check:\n\nS=4:\n\nmod3:1 (4 mod3=1), mod5:4 mod5=4. Since mod5 is 4, which is neither 0 nor1. So reject.\n\nS=5:\n\nmod3:2 (5 mod3=2), mod5:0. mod3 is 2, which is not 0 or1 \u2192 reject.\n\nWait, mod3 for S=5 is 2, so since S mod3 is not 0 or1, so reject.\n\nWait, but S=5 mod5=0, so mod5 is okay (since 0 is allowed). But mod3 must be 0 or1. Since mod3=2, so rejected.\n\nHmm, so need both conditions.\n\nContinuing:\n\nS=4: mod3=1 (okay), mod5=4 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=5: mod3=2 (no), mod5=0 (okay) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=6: mod3=0 (okay), mod5=1 (6 mod5=1) \u2192 both okay. Accept.\n\nS=7: mod3=1 (okay), mod5=2 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=8: mod3=2 (no), mod5=3 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=9: mod3=0 (okay), mod5=4 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=10: mod3=1 (10 mod3=1), mod5=0 \u2192 both okay. Accept.\n\nS=11: mod3=2 (no), mod5=1 \u2192 mod3 is bad.\n\nS=12: mod3=0 (okay), mod5=2 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=13: mod3=1 (okay), mod5=3 (no).\n\nS=14: mod3=2 (no), mod5=4 (no).\n\nS=15: mod3=0 (okay), mod5=0 (okay) \u2192 accept.\n\nThus the acceptable S are 6,10,15. Wait:\n\nWait S=6: yes.\n\nS=10: yes.\n\nS=15: yes.\n\nWait, let's check S=15:\n\n15 mod3=0, mod5=0. So yes.\n\nAre there any others?\n\nWait S=4: no.\n\nS=5: no.\n\nS=6: yes.\n\nS=7: no.\n\nS=8: no.\n\nS=9: no.\n\nS=10: yes.\n\nS=11: no.\n\nS=12: no.\n\nS=13: no.\n\nS=14: no.\n\nS=15: yes.\n\nSo total of 3 solutions. Hmm. So k=15 (b=16) has 3 solutions.\n\nHmm. Maybe trying k=24 (b=25):\n\nWait perhaps I need a better strategy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when k is a highly composite number, it can have more factors, leading to more solutions.\n\nLet me try k=24 (b=25):\n\nsqrt(25)=5, so S from5 to24.\n\nNeed S(S-1) divisible by24. 24 factors into 2^3 *3.\n\nThus, S(S-1) must be divisible by 8 and 3.\n\nTo be divisible by 8 and 3.\n\nDivisible by 8: either S divisible by8 or S-1 divisible by8, or S divisible by4 and S-1 even? Wait, since S and S-1 are consecutive, one is even. So to get divisibility by 8, need either S or S-1 divisible by8, or one divisible by4 and the other divisible by2. Wait, actually, since S and S-1 are consecutive, one is even, the other is odd. The even one must be divisible by 8, or the even one divisible by 4 and the other divisible by 2? Wait, no. Let me think:\n\nThe product S(S-1) is divisible by 8 if:\n\nEither the even term is divisible by 8,\n\nOr the even term is divisible by 4 and the odd term is divisible by 2? Wait, no, since the odd term can't be even.\n\nWait, actually, since S and S-1 are consecutive, exactly one is even. Let me denote E as the even one and O as the odd one. So E * O must be divisible by 8. Since E is even, so E is divisible by 2. To have E*O divisible by8, since O is odd, E must be divisible by8. Because 2*(something odd) can't contribute more than a factor of 2 unless E has more factors of 2.\n\nSimilarly, for divisibility by 3: either S divisible by3 or S-1 divisible by3.\n\nTherefore, the conditions for divisibility by24 are:\n\n1. Either S \u22610 mod8 or S \u22611 mod8 (so that E is divisible by8),\n\nAND\n\n2. Either S \u22610 mod3 or S\u22611 mod3.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are numbers S in [5,24] that satisfy both conditions.\n\nLet me compute this step by step.\n\nFirst, list all S from5 to24.\n\nFirst, let's find S where S mod8 is 0 or1:\n\nPossible residues mod8: 0 or1.\n\nSo S \u22610 mod8 \u2192 S=8,16,24.\n\nS\u22611 mod8 \u2192 S=1,9,17. But since S starts at5, the S\u22611 mod8 in the range are9,17.\n\nThus the S that satisfy the first condition (divisible by8 or 1 mod8) are:\n\n8,9,16,17,24.\n\nNow, among these, also need to satisfy the mod3 condition.\n\nSecond condition: S \u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nCheck each:\n\nS=8:\n\nmod3:8 mod3=2 \u2192 not 0 or1. Reject.\n\nS=9:\n\nmod3=0 \u2192 yes. So accept.\n\nS=16:\n\n16 mod3=1 (since 15 divisible by3, so 16=15+1). So mod3=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nS=17:\n\n17 mod3= 17-15=2 \u2192 mod3=2 \u2192 reject.\n\nS=24:\n\n24 mod3=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus the valid S are 9,16,24.\n\nWait, but let me check S=24:\n\nS=24 is within [5,24], yes. So total of 3 solutions? Hmm.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed some?\n\nWait, let me check all numbers between5-24 that satisfy both conditions:\n\nFirst, the first condition (divisible by8 or 1 mod8):\n\nNumbers:\n\n8,9,16,17,24.\n\nThen check mod3:\n\n9 mod3=0 \u2192 ok.\n\n16 mod3=1 \u2192 ok.\n\n24 mod3=0 \u2192 ok.\n\nSo 3 solutions.\n\nHmm, that's still low.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's see S= 12:\n\nWait, S=12 is not in the first condition list. Let's see why.\n\nS=12 mod8=4 \u2192 so not 0 or1 mod8. So it's not in the first set. But maybe S=12 can still satisfy divisibility by8?\n\nWait S=12 is even. The even term is 12, so 12 is divisible by4 but not by8. So 12*11=132. 132 divided by8 is 16.5 \u2192 not integer. So not divisible by8. So indeed, it's not acceptable.\n\nHmm. Maybe need a different k where the factors allow more solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let's try k=12 (b=13) had 3 solutions. Let's try k=20 (b=21):\n\nsqrt(21)\u22484.58, so ceil is5. S from5 to20.\n\nNeed S(S-1) divisible by20. 20 factors into2\u00b2\u00d75.\n\nThus, the product must be divisible by4 and5.\n\nDivisible by4: since S and S-1 are consecutive, one is even. The even one must be divisible by4.\n\nDivisible by5: either S divisible by5 or S-1 divisible by5.\n\nTherefore conditions:\n\n1. Either S divisible by4 or S-1 divisible by4 (i.e., S\u22610 mod4 or S\u22611 mod4).\n\nWait, actually, the even term must be divisible by4. So:\n\nIf S is even (so S is even), then S divisible by4.\n\nIf S is odd (so S-1 is even), then S-1 divisible by4 (so S \u22611 mod4).\n\nTherefore, the even term must be divisible by4 \u21d2 S \u22610 mod4 or S\u22611 mod4.\n\nAND\n\n2. S \u22610 mod5 or S\u22611 mod5.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are numbers S in [5,20] that satisfy both.\n\nLet me find all such S:\n\nFirst, find S where S \u22610 or1 mod4 and also S\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nLet me list S from5 to20 and check.\n\nS=5:\n\nmod4=1, mod5=0 \u2192 yes (since mod4=1 and mod5=0). So yes.\n\nS=6:\n\nmod4=2 (no), mod5=1 \u2192 mod4 is not 0 or1 \u2192 no.\n\nS=7:\n\nmod4=3 (no), mod5=2 \u2192 no.\n\nS=8:\n\nmod4=0 (yes), mod5=3 \u2192 mod5 is neither 0 nor1 \u2192 no.\n\nS=9:\n\nmod4=1 (yes), mod5=4 \u2192 no.\n\nS=10:\n\nmod4=2 (no), mod5=0 \u2192 mod4 is bad.\n\nS=11:\n\nmod4=3 (no), mod5=1 \u2192 mod4 bad.\n\nS=12:\n\nmod4=0 (yes), mod5=2 \u2192 no.\n\nS=13:\n\nmod4=1 (yes), mod5=3 \u2192 no.\n\nS=14:\n\nmod4=2 (no), mod5=4 \u2192 no.\n\nS=15:\n\nmod4=3 (no), mod5=0 \u2192 mod4 bad.\n\nS=16:\n\nmod4=0 (yes), mod5=1 \u2192 yes (mod5=1). So yes.\n\nS=17:\n\nmod4=1 (yes), mod5=2 \u2192 no.\n\nS=18:\n\nmod4=2 (no), mod5=3 \u2192 no.\n\nS=19:\n\nmod4=3 (no), mod5=4 \u2192 no.\n\nS=20:\n\nmod4=0 (yes), mod5=0 \u2192 yes (mod5=0). So yes.\n\nThus, the valid S are 5,16,20. So 3 solutions again. Hmm.\n\nHmm, so perhaps trying higher k.\n\nWait, let's try k=24 (b=25) again but maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, let me think of another approach. Maybe for k= b-1 being a factorial number? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider when k is a power of 2. Let me try k=16 (b=17):\n\nsqrt(17)\u22484.123, so S from5 to16.\n\nNeed S(S-1) divisible by16.\n\n16 is 2^4. So S(S-1) divisible by16.\n\nSince S and S-1 are consecutive, one is even. To get divisibility by16, the even term must be divisible by16, or the even term divisible by8 and the other divisible by2? Wait, let's see:\n\nLet me think: For S(S-1) divisible by16:\n\nSince S and S-1 are consecutive, exactly one is even. Let the even term be E = max(S, S-1) if S is even, or E = S-1 if S is odd. Wait, actually:\n\nIf S is even: E = S, and S-1 is odd.\n\nIf S is odd: E = S-1, and S is odd.\n\nThus, for the product to be divisible by16:\n\nIf S is even:\n\nThen S must be divisible by16, since the other term (S-1) is odd, so only the even term contributes factors of2. To get 2^4, S must be divisible by16.\n\nIf S is odd:\n\nThen S-1 must be divisible by16 (since S is odd, S-1 is even, so divisible by16).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way:\n\nWait, if S is even:\n\nE = S must have at least 4 factors of2, so divisible by16.\n\nIf S is odd:\n\nE = S-1 must be divisible by16, so S \u22611 mod16.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are S \u22610 mod16 or S\u22611 mod16.\n\nAdditionally, since S is between5 and16 (since k=16, so b=17, S up to16).\n\nThus:\n\nPossible S:\n\nS=16 (\u22610 mod16),\n\nS=1 (too low, since S starts at5),\n\nS=1+16=17 exceeds the upper limit of16.\n\nThus only S=16.\n\nThus, only one solution here. So count=1. Not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe try k=21 (b=22):\n\nsqrt(22)\u22484.69, so S from5 to21.\n\nNeed S(S-1) divisible by21 (3\u00d77). So:\n\nEither S divisible by3 or S-1 divisible by3,\n\nAND\n\nEither S divisible by7 or S-1 divisible by7.\n\nSo need numbers S in5-21 where:\n\n(S mod3=0 or1) AND (S mod7=0 or1).\n\nLet me list them:\n\nS=5: mod3=2 (no), mod7=5 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=6: mod3=0 (yes), mod7=6 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=7: mod3=1 (yes), mod7=0 (yes) \u2192 yes.\n\nS=8: mod3=2 (no), mod7=1 (yes) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=9: mod3=0 (yes), mod7=2 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=10: mod3=1 (yes), mod7=3 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=11: mod3=2 (no), mod7=4 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=12: mod3=0 (yes), mod7=5 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=13: mod3=1 (yes), mod7=6 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=14: mod3=2 (no), mod7=0 (yes) \u2192 reject (mod3 is bad).\n\nS=15: mod3=0 (yes), mod7=1 (yes) \u2192 yes.\n\nS=16: mod3=1 (yes), mod7=2 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=17: mod3=2 (no), mod7=3 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=18: mod3=0 (yes), mod7=4 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=19: mod3=1 (yes), mod7=5 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=20: mod3=2 (no), mod7=6 (no) \u2192 reject.\n\nS=21: mod3=0 (yes), mod7=0 (yes) \u2192 yes.\n\nThus the valid S are7,15,21 \u2192 count=3.\n\nHmm, again 3.

Wait from6 to30 inclusive is 25 numbers? Wait 30-6=24, so 25 numbers.\n\nBut let's see:\n\nTotal residues mod15 are 0,1,6,10.\n\nSo in each 15 numbers, 4 solutions.

So 7 solutions.

Let me see if we can compute the number of solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of going one by one, look for when k has multiple factors so that the number of solutions increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is multiplicative in the number of prime factors. Wait, if k factors into pairwise coprime factors, then the number of solutions would multiply?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of k= 210 (b=211). But this might be too big.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of when k is a factorial. Let me try k=120 (b=121):\n\nsqrt(121)=11, so S from11 to120.\n\nNeed S(S-1) divisible by120=2^3\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nConditions:\n\nDivisible by8: the even term must be divisible by8.\n\nDivisible by3: S\u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nDivisible by5: S\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nSo:\n\nFirst, the even term must be divisible by8 \u21d2 S\u22610 mod8 or S\u22611 mod8 (since if S even, then S divisible by8; if odd, then S-1 divisible by8 \u21d2 S\u22611 mod8).\n\nSecond, mod3 and mod5 as before.\n\nThus, combining these conditions:\n\nS must satisfy:\n\n(S mod8=0 or1),\n\nAND (S mod3=0 or1),\n\nAND (S mod5=0 or1).\n\nThe total number of solutions is the number of S in [11,120] that satisfy all three.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but maybe the count would be higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we need to find k where the number of solutions is 2^number_of_prime_factors.\n\nWait, for example, if k has three distinct prime factors, then 2^3=8 solutions per modulus, but adjusted for the range.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of k= 2^3\u00d73\u00d75=120 (as above). Then the number of solutions mod 8, mod3, mod5 would be 2 each, so total solutions mod 120 is 2\u00d72\u00d72=8. So in the range 1-120, there are8 solutions, but since our range is from11 to120, perhaps around 8 solutions?\n\nBut since the interval is large, maybe the number is about 8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying k= 24 (b=25) had 3 solutions, k=30 had7, so maybe k=60 (b=61) would have more?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying k= 60 (b=61):\n\nsqrt(61)=7.81, so S from8 to60.\n\nk=60 factors into 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nConditions for S(S-1) divisible by60:\n\nDivisible by4: even term divisible by4 \u21d2 S\u22610 mod4 or S\u22611 mod4.\n\nDivisible by3: S\u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nDivisible by5: S\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, need S in8-60 such that:\n\n(S mod4=0 or1),\n\n(S mod3=0 or1),\n\n(S mod5=0 or1).\n\nThis is similar to earlier cases but with more conditions.\n\nThe total number of solutions would be the number of S in that interval satisfying all three.\n\nThis requires checking, but perhaps we can compute it using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nThe combined modulus is lcm(4,3,5)=60. So mod60.\n\nWe need to find residues mod60 that satisfy:\n\nmod4:0 or1,\n\nmod3:0 or1,\n\nmod5:0 or1.\n\nEach condition has 2 options, so total combinations:2\u00d72\u00d72=8 possible residue combinations.\n\nEach combination corresponds to a unique residue mod60.\n\nThus, in each block of60 numbers, there are8 solutions.\n\nFrom8 to60:\n\nTotal numbers:60-8+1=53.\n\nThus, almost one full block (60 numbers) but starting at8.\n\nNumber of solutions would be approximately8, but need to adjust for the starting point.\n\nLet me list all residues mod60 that satisfy the conditions:\n\nWe can systematically find all residues r mod60 where:\n\nr mod4 \u2208{0,1},\n\nr mod3 \u2208{0,1},\n\nr mod5 \u2208{0,1}.\n\nThis requires solving the system for each combination.\n\nLet me consider all 8 combinations:\n\n1. mod4=0, mod3=0, mod5=0: Solve r \u22610 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60 \u21d2 r=0 mod60.\n\n2. mod4=0, mod3=0, mod5=1: r\u22610 mod4, 0 mod3,1 mod5.\n\nFind r\u22610 mod12 (lcm4,3), and1 mod5.\n\nLet r=12k \u22611 mod5 \u21d212k\u22611 mod5 \u21d22k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22613 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+3 \u21d2r=12*(5m+3)=60m+36.\n\nThus r\u226136 mod60.\n\n3. mod4=0, mod3=1, mod5=0: r\u22610 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5.\n\nr\u22610 mod20 (lcm4,5), and1 mod3.\n\nLet r=20k \u22611 mod3 \u21d220k\u22612k\u22611 mod3 \u21d22k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2r=20*(3m+2)=60m+40.\n\nThus r\u226140 mod60.\n\n4. mod4=0, mod3=1, mod5=1: r\u22610 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.\n\nr\u22610 mod4, and r\u22611 mod15 (since 3 and5 are coprime).\n\nSolve 4 divides r, r=15k+1.\n\nLet 15k+1 \u22610 mod4 \u21d215k \u2261-1 mod4 \u21d23k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d23k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2k=4m+1 \u21d2r=15*(4m+1)+1=60m+16.\n\nThus r\u226116 mod60.\n\n5. mod4=1, mod3=0, mod5=0: r\u22611 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod5.\n\nr\u22610 mod15, and 1 mod4.\n\nLet r=15k \u22611 mod4 \u21d215k\u22613k\u22611 mod4 \u21d23k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k=4m+3 \u21d2r=15*(4m+3)=60m+45.\n\nThus r\u226145 mod60.\n\n6. mod4=1, mod3=0, mod5=1: r\u22611 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5.\n\nr\u22610 mod3, and r\u22611 mod4 and mod5.\n\nLet r\u22611 mod20 (since mod4 and mod5: lcm4,5=20).

The residues are 0,1,16,21,25,36,40,45.\n\nBetween8 and60:\n\n0 mod60: 60,\n\n1 mod60:1 (too low),\n\n16,\n\n21,\n\n25,\n\n36,\n\n40,\n\n45.\n\nSo total of7 solutions.\n\nHmm.\n\nContinuing, perhaps trying k= 120 (b=121):\n\nsqrt(121)=11, so S from11 to120.\n\nk=120=2^3\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nConditions:\n\nDivisible by8 \u21d2 even term divisible by8 \u21d2 S\u22610 mod8 or1 mod8.\n\nDivisible by3 \u21d2 S\u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nDivisible by5 \u21d2 S\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, similar to previous, but now mod8 instead of mod4.\n\nSo conditions:\n\nS mod8 \u2208{0,1},\n\nS mod3 \u2208{0,1},\n\nS mod5 \u2208{0,1}.\n\nThe number of solutions mod lcm(8,3,5)=120 is 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 residues.\n\nThus, in each 120 numbers, there are8 solutions.\n\nSince we're looking from11 to120:\n\nThe residues mod120 would be the same as before but with mod8 instead of mod4.\n\nLet me see:\n\nThe residues mod120 that satisfy all conditions can be found similarly, but it's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, since the interval is exactly 110 numbers (120-11+1=110), which is less than 120, so perhaps about8 solutions.\n\nBut even if it's 8, that's still less than10.\n\nHmm, maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, perhaps the maximum number of solutions is when k is one less than a square?\n\nWait the problem says \"the two digits sum to sqrt(n)\". Since sqrt(n) must be integer, so n must be a perfect square.\n\nAlso, n is a two-digit number in base b, so n =d1*b + d2, with d1 and d2 digits (d1 from1 tob-1, d2 from0 tob-1).\n\nAdditionally, sqrt(n) =d1 +d2 =S.\n\nTherefore, n = S\u00b2 =d1*b +d2.\n\nBut also, since d2 =S -d1,\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\nS\u00b2 =d1*b + (S -d1) =d1*(b-1) +S,\n\nwhich rearranges to:\n\nd1= (S\u00b2 - S)/(b-1).\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between1 andb-1,\n\nthen (S\u00b2 -S) must be divisible by(b-1).\n\nAlso, d2= S -d1 must be between0 andb-1.\n\nAdditionally, since n =S\u00b2 must be less thanb\u00b2 (as a two-digit number in base b), so S <b.\n\nSo S is between ceiling(sqrt(b)) andb-1.\n\nSo for each b, the number of b-beautiful numbers is the number of integers S in [ceil(sqrt(b)),b-1] such that (S\u00b2 -S) is divisible by(b-1).\n\nLet me consider that (S\u00b2 -S) =S(S-1).\n\nThus, (b-1) divides S(S-1).\n\nSince S and S-1 are coprime, then (b-1) must divide either S or S-1, or split its factors between them.\n\nBut since they are coprime, (b-1) must be a product of factors where one divides S and the other divides S-1.\n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of (b-1), we can set d divides S and (b-1)/d divides S-1, or vice versa.\n\nThus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) such that there exists an S where S \u22610 mod d and S\u22611 mod ( (b-1)/d ).\n\nEach such pair (d, (b-1)/d) gives a solution via Chinese Remainder Theorem, provided that the congruences are compatible.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such divisor pairs, which is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1). However, since each divisor pair (d, (b-1)/d) is counted twice except when d=(b-1)/d, but since we need to consider all possible factorizations, the total number is actually equal to the number of divisors of (b-1).\n\nWait, but this might not exactly hold because each divisor pair can give a unique solution.\n\nWait, the number of solutions S is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1), because for each divisor d of (b-1), setting d divides S and (b-1)/d divides (S-1), which is a system of congruences that has a unique solution mod (b-1). Thus each divisor corresponds to exactly one solution mod (b-1), so in the interval from1 tob-1, there are \u03c4(b-1) solutions, where \u03c4 is the number of positive divisors.\n\nBut we need to count only those S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions is \u03c4(b-1) minus the number of solutions S < ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nHowever, the solutions S are all residues mod (b-1), so they are spread from1 tob-1. So the number of solutions in the interval [ceil(sqrt(b)),b-1] is \u03c4(b-1) minus the number of solutions below ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nTherefore, if \u03c4(b-1) is large enough, then even after subtracting some, the count can exceed10.\n\nHence, to have more than10 solutions, we need \u03c4(b-1) to be sufficiently large. Since \u03c4(n) is the number of divisors of n, the more divisors n has, the higher \u03c4(n).\n\nTherefore, to minimize b, we need the minimal b such that \u03c4(b-1) >10 plus some adjustment for the subtraction.\n\nWait, but actually, it's not exactly \u03c4(b-1), but \u03c4(b-1) divided by something? Or perhaps the number of solutions is exactly \u03c4(b-1). Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that for each divisor d of (b-1), there is exactly one solution S mod (b-1). So total solutions mod (b-1) are \u03c4(b-1). Therefore, in the range1 tob-1, there are exactly \u03c4(b-1) solutions. Since the interval [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] is a subset of that, the count is the number of those solutions in that interval.\n\nTherefore, to have more than10 solutions, we need \u03c4(b-1) to be at least 11, but also that most of those solutions lie in the upper part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \u03c4(b-1) must be greater than 10. Because if there are \u03c4(b-1) solutions in total, but some are below the sqrt(b) threshold.\n\nSuppose that \u03c4(b-1) is 12, then if only one solution is below sqrt(b), then count would be 11, which is over10. So the minimal b would be the first b where \u03c4(b-1) exceeds10.\n\nWait, but let's confirm this with an example.\n\nTake the earlier case where b=7 (k=6). \u03c4(6)=4 divisors (1,2,3,6). But we had 3 solutions. Hmm, discrepancy here.\n\nWait, in the case of b=7 (k=6), \u03c4(6)=4, but the number of solutions was3. So perhaps not exactly \u03c4(b-1).\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of (b-1) where d \u2264 sqrt(b-1), but I need to think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the solutions S as follows:\n\nEach solution corresponds to a divisor d of (b-1). Let me explain:\n\nFor each divisor d of (b-1), set:\n\nS \u22610 mod d,\n\nS \u22611 mod ( (b-1)/d ).\n\nBy Chinese remainder theorem, since d and (b-1)/d are coprime (as d is a divisor), there exists a unique solution mod (b-1).\n\nTherefore each divisor gives exactly one solution S mod (b-1).\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is exactly \u03c4(b-1). Thus in the range1 tob-1, there are \u03c4(b-1) solutions.\n\nTherefore, in the interval [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], the number of solutions is equal to \u03c4(b-1) minus the number of solutions S < ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nTherefore, to have the count exceed10, \u03c4(b-1) must be sufficiently large such that even after subtracting those below sqrt(b), the remaining is more than10.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the smallest b where \u03c4(b-1) is large enough that \u03c4(b-1) - number_below \u226511.\n\nTo minimize b, we need \u03c4(b-1) as large as possible. The minimal b would be when \u03c4(b-1) is first large enough.\n\nThe number of divisors \u03c4(n) increases when n is highly composite. So we need to find the smallest n = b-1 where \u03c4(n) is greater than, say, 10 or so.\n\nLooking at highly composite numbers:\n\nThe number of divisors for n:\n\nThe first n with \u03c4(n)=12 is 60 (divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60).\n\nWait \u03c4(60)=12. So if we take b-1=60 \u21d2 b=61, then \u03c4(60)=12. So the total solutions would be12. But how many are below sqrt(b)=sqrt(61)\u22487.81?\n\nThe solutions S are all the numbers from1 to60 that are solutions mod60. Each corresponds to a divisor d of60.\n\nWait, perhaps the solutions S mod60 correspond to the solutions we calculated earlier for k=60 (b=61). We found7 solutions in the interval8-60. But \u03c4(60)=12, so total solutions12. Then the solutions below8 would be12-7=5? Let me check:\n\nEarlier for k=60 (b=61), we found residues mod60:0,1,16,21,25,36,40,45. Wait, but that was for k=60? Wait no, earlier when I did k=60, the residues mod60 were 0,1,16,21,25,36,40,45. Wait that was for k=60, which is b=61, and the total solutions mod60 are8. But \u03c4(60)=12. Hmm, there is a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps my previous reasoning is incorrect. Maybe the number of solutions is not exactly \u03c4(n). Let me re-examine.\n\nWait in the case of k=6 (b=7), \u03c4(6)=4 divisors (1,2,3,6). But the number of solutions was3 (S=3,4,6). Hmm, so discrepancy here.\n\nWait let me see:\n\nFor k=6 (b=7), the equation S(S-1) divisible by6.\n\nPossible S from3 to6.\n\nS=3:3*2=6 divisible by6 \u2192 yes.\n\nS=4:4*3=12 divisible by6 \u2192 yes.\n\nS=5:5*4=20 mod6=2 \u2192 no.\n\nS=6:6*5=30 divisible by6 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus total solutions3. \u03c4(6)=4. So one less.\n\nHmm, so why discrepancy?\n\nBecause one of the solutions would be S=0 mod6, but S starts at3, so S=6 is included. So perhaps when the solution S=0 modk is at the upper end.\n\nWait maybe when a solution is S=0 modk, it is exactly the upper limit S=k.\n\nIndeed, S=k is always a solution, as we saw before (since S=k-1 +1 =k, and then S\u00b2=(k)^2, but n would be d1*k +d2 where d1=(S\u00b2 -S)/(k). Wait, no, when b=k+1, then n=S\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b=k+1, so S must be <k+1, so S=k is allowed since b=k+1.\n\nWait, S can be up tok, since the upper limit is b-1 =k.\n\nWait in the case of k=6 (b=7), S=6 is allowed and is a solution.\n\nSo total solutions are \u03c4(k) but excluding solutions where S=0 modd but S=0?\n\nWait perhaps the solutions are \u03c4(k), but S must be at least1.\n\nWait in k=6, \u03c4(k)=4, but one solution would be S=0 mod6, which is S=6, which is valid. So why discrepancy?\n\nWait maybe the count is \u03c4(k), but when you consider that S must be in [1, k], so all solutions except S=0 modk would have S from1 tok-1, but S=0 modk is S=k.\n\nWait let's think of it as the number of solutions is exactly \u03c4(k), with S ranging from1 tok.\n\nWait in the case of k=6:\n\nThe solutions are S=3,4,6.\n\nWait \u03c4(6)=4 divisors (1,2,3,6). Let's see:\n\nDivisors d of6:1,2,3,6.\n\nFor each divisor d:\n\nLet me compute S using the CRT:\n\nFor d=1:\n\nSet S\u22610 mod1 (always true), S\u22611 mod6/1=6.\n\nThus S\u22611 mod6. The solution in1-6 is S=1. But S must be \u2265ceil(sqrt(7))=3. So S=1 is rejected.\n\nFor d=2:\n\nSet S\u22610 mod2, S\u22611 mod3.\n\nS\u22610 mod2 and S\u22611 mod3.\n\nSolutions: S=4 mod6 (since 4 mod2=0, 4 mod3=1). Thus S=4.\n\nFor d=3:\n\nSet S\u22610 mod3, S\u22611 mod2.\n\nS\u22610 mod3, S\u22611 mod2 \u21d2 S=3 mod6.\n\nSolutions:3 mod6. Thus S=3.\n\nFor d=6:\n\nSet S\u22610 mod6, S\u22611 mod1 (always true). Thus S\u22610 mod6 \u21d2 S=6.\n\nThus the solutions are S=3,4,6. So \u03c4(6)=4, but one solution (S=1) is below the required minimum (3). So total valid solutions3.\n\nAh, so in general, the number of valid solutions is \u03c4(k) minus the number of solutions S < ceil(sqrt(b)).\n\nTherefore, to get over10 solutions, we need \u03c4(k) - (number of solutions below ceil(sqrt(b))) >10.\n\nTherefore, we need \u03c4(k) to be sufficiently large so that even after subtracting those below sqrt(b), it still exceeds10.\n\nThus, the minimal k (so b=k+1) would be when \u03c4(k) is first large enough such that \u03c4(k) - (number below) >10.\n\nTo find this, let's look for the smallest k where \u03c4(k) is at least 12 or so.\n\nLooking at highly composite numbers:\n\nThe number with \u03c4(n)=12 is 60 (divisors 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60). So \u03c4(60)=12.\n\nLet me check k=60 (b=61):\n\nsqrt(b)=sqrt(61)\u22487.81, so S must be \u22658.\n\nThe solutions S are \u03c4(60)=12 solutions in1-60. The solutions below8 are those with S<8.\n\nLet me find how many solutions are below8.\n\nUsing the divisors d of60:\n\nEach divisor d gives a solution S mod60.\n\nThe solutions correspond to the following:\n\nFor each divisor d of60:\n\nCompute S \u22610 modd, S\u22611 mod(60/d).\n\nWe need to find which of these solutions are less than8.\n\nThis requires checking each divisor d:\n\nDivisors of60:1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60.\n\nLet's go through each d:\n\n1. d=1:\n\nS\u22610 mod1 (always true), S\u22611 mod60 \u21d2 S=1 mod60. So S=1.\n\nThis is below8.\n\n2. d=2:\n\nS\u22610 mod2, S\u22611 mod30.\n\nFind S\u22610 mod2 and S\u22611 mod30.\n\nS=30m +1 \u22610 mod2 \u21d21 mod2 \u21d2 no solution? Wait 30m+1 must be even \u21d230m is even, so m even. Let m=2k:\n\nS=30*(2k)+1=60k+1. The smallest S is1 mod60, which is1, but next is61, which is over60.\n\nWait perhaps there is no solution between1 and60 except S=1?\n\nWait S must be \u226460.\n\nWait solving S \u22611 mod30 and even:\n\nLet me write S=30k +1.\n\nTo be even, 30k+1 is even \u21d230k is odd \u21d2k must be such that30k is odd, but30 is even, so impossible. Thus no solution except S=1 (k=0) which is already counted in d=1.\n\nThus for d=2, no solution in1-60 except S=1 already counted.\n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nWait the solution for d=2 should be:\n\nS\u22610 mod2,\n\nS\u22611 mod(60/2)=30.\n\nThus S=30k +1 must be even. 30k is even, so +1 makes it odd. Contradiction. Thus no solution except S=1 mod60, which is already covered by d=1.\n\nThus d=2 gives no new solution below60 except S=1.\n\n3. d=3:\n\nS\u22610 mod3, S\u22611 mod20.\n\nSolve S\u22610 mod3 and S\u22611 mod20.\n\nLet S=20m +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d220m +1 \u22612m +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d22m\u2261-1 \u21d22m\u22612 mod3 \u21d2m\u22611 mod3 \u21d2m=3k+1 \u21d2S=20(3k+1)+1=60k+21.\n\nWithin1-60, S=21 (k=0).\n\nSo S=21, which is above8.\n\nThus no solution below8 from d=3.\n\n4. d=4:\n\nS\u22610 mod4, S\u22611 mod15.\n\nSolve S\u22610 mod4, S\u22611 mod15.\n\nLet S=15m +1 \u22610 mod4 \u21d215m +1 \u22613m +1 \u22610 mod4 \u21d23m\u2261-1 \u21d23m\u22613 mod4 \u21d2m\u22611 mod4 \u21d2m=4k+1 \u21d2S=15*(4k+1)+1=60k+16.\n\nWithin1-60: S=16 (k=0).\n\n16 is above8.\n\nThus no solution below8 from d=4.\n\n5. d=5:\n\nS\u22610 mod5, S\u22611 mod12.\n\nSolve S\u22610 mod5, S\u22611 mod12.\n\nLet S=12m +1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d212m +1 \u22612m +1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d22m\u2261-1 \u21d22m\u22614 mod5 \u21d2m\u22612 mod5 \u21d2m=5k+2 \u21d2S=12*(5k+2)+1=60k+25.\n\nWithin1-60: S=25 (k=0).

So S=6 mod30 \u21d26 is within1-30.\n\nThus S=6 is a solution.\n\nd=10:\n\nS\u22610 mod10, S\u22611 mod3 \u21d2S=10 mod30 \u21d210 mod3=1 \u21d2 yes.

So S=15 mod30 \u21d215.\n\nd=30:\n\nS=30 mod30 \u21d230.\n\nThus solutions are1,6,10,15,16,21, etc. Wait:\n\nWait the solutions mod30 are:\n\nFrom each divisor:\n\nd=1:1,\n\nd=2:16,\n\nd=3:21,\n\nd=5:11,\n\nd=6:6,\n\nd=10:10,\n\nd=15:15,\n\nd=30:30.\n\nThus S=1,6,10,11,15,16,21,30.\n\nThese are the solutions in1-30.\n\nThus below6 (S<6), only S=1 and S= (others like6 is exactly6). So S=1 is below6.\n\nThus \u03c4(30)=8, so solutions in [6,30] are8-1=7. Which matches earlier count.\n\nThus k=60 is the first with \u03c4(k)=12 leading to11 solutions.\n\nTherefore the minimal b is61.\n\nWait but let me confirm with k=60, b=61:\n\nWe have \u03c4(60)=12, and solutions below8 (sqrt(61)=~7.81) is just S=1, so total solutions12-1=11>10.

S=18 mod36 \u21d218 mod2=0\u22611 mod2? No. S=18 is even, so mod2=0\u22601.\n\nd=36:S=36 mod36 \u21d236.\n\nThus the only solution below7 is S=1. Thus total solutions9-1=8 <10.\n\nThus, the first k where \u03c4(k)=12 is k=60, leading to count=11.\n\nThus, the minimal b is61.\n\nWait but let me check k= 60:\n\nWe need to confirm that there are indeed11 solutions between8 and60.\n\nEarlier when I listed the solutions mod60:\n\nThe residues mod60 were 0,1,16,21,25,36,40,45. Wait that was for k=60?\n\nWait no, in the earlier detailed analysis for k=60 (b=61), the residues mod60 were 0,1,16,21,25,36,40,45. So total of8 residues, but \u03c4(60)=12, so perhaps my previous analysis was incomplete?\n\nWait I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait when I considered k=60 and \u03c4(60)=12, but when I listed the residues using the divisors, I only found8 solutions. But according to divisor count, there should be12 solutions.\n\nAh! I think my mistake was in the previous detailed analysis where I considered the conditions mod8, mod3, mod5, but actually the full analysis for k=60 requires considering all divisors and their combinations.\n\nWait let me recast the problem:\n\nFor k=60, each divisor d of60 gives a solution S mod60.\n\nThere are12 divisors of60, so there are12 solutions mod60.\n\nThese solutions are spread from1 to60.\n\nThe solutions are:\n\nFor each divisor d of60:\n\nS \u22610 modd,\n\nS\u22611 mod(60/d).\n\nThese are all distinct mod60.\n\nTherefore, in the range1-60, there are12 solutions.\n\nTo find how many are \u22658:\n\nOnly S=1 is below8, so 12-1=11.\n\nThus the count is indeed11.\n\nTherefore, the minimal b is61.\n\nWait but let me check k= 24 (b=25):\n\n\u03c4(24)=8 solutions.

Thus no solution except S=?\n\nWait then maybe S= 6m+1 must be even \u21d26m must be odd \u21d2m must be 0.5 \u21d2invalid. Thus no solution except S=?\n\nWait then perhaps the solution for d=2 is nonexistent except S=1 mod12?\n\nHmm, maybe my previous calculation was wrong.\n\nWait perhaps I need to recompute for k=12:\n\nFor each divisor d of12:\n\nd=1: S=1 mod12 \u21d21.\n\nd=2:S\u22610 mod2, S\u22611 mod6 \u21d2S=4 mod12 (as follows):\n\nLet me set S=6m +1 \u22610 mod2 \u21d26m+1 is even \u21d26m must be odd \u21d2 m=0.5 \u21d2invalid.\n\nAlternatively, set S=2k. Then S\u22611 mod6 \u21d22k\u22611 mod6 \u21d22k\u22611 mod6 \u21d2k\u22610.5 mod3 \u21d2invalid.\n\nThus no solution except S=?\n\nWait maybe no solution for d=2.\n\nSimilarly for d=3:\n\nS\u22610 mod3, S\u22611 mod4 \u21d2S=9 mod12.\n\nd=4:\n\nS\u22610 mod4, S\u22611 mod3 \u21d2S=4 mod12 (since S=3m+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d23m+1\u22610 \u21d23m\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d23m\u22613 \u21d2m\u22611 mod4 \u21d2m=4k+1 \u21d2S=3*(4k+1)+1=12k+4 \u21d24 mod12).\n\nd=6:\n\nS\u22610 mod6, S\u22611 mod2 \u21d2must be even and \u22610 mod6 \u21d2 even, but mod2=0\u22601.\n\nd=12:\n\nS=12 mod12 \u21d212.\n\nThus solutions are1,4,9,12. So \u03c4(12)=6 divisors but only4 solutions.\n\nHmm discrepancy here. So \u03c4(k) counts the number of divisors, but not all divisors yield valid solutions?\n\nAh, because for some divisors, the congruence system has no solution.\n\nThus my earlier assumption that \u03c4(k) equals the number of solutions is incorrect.\n\nThus my previous reasoning is flawed.\n\nThis complicates things. So the number of solutions is not exactly \u03c4(k), but the number of divisors d of k for which the congruence system S\u22610 modd and S\u22611 mod(k/d) has a solution.\n\nThis requires that gcd(d, k/d) divides1, which it does since d and k/d are coprime (as d is a divisor).\n\nWait, since d divides k, then gcd(d, k/d)= gcd(d, k/d)=1?\n\nNo, not necessarily. For example, d=6 and k=12: gcd(6,2)=2\u22601.\n\nAh, so the Chinese Remainder Theorem requires that d and k/d are coprime for the congruences to have a solution.\n\nWait, the congruence S\u22610 modd and S\u22611 mod(k/d).\n\nThese congruences can only have a solution if gcd(d, k/d) divides (1 -0)=1.\n\nThus gcd(d, k/d) must divide1 \u21d2 gcd(d, k/d)=1.\n\nTherefore, the solution exists only if d and k/d are coprime.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d ofk such that gcd(d, k/d)=1.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d ofk with gcd(d,k/d)=1.\n\nTherefore, this is not necessarily \u03c4(k), but a subset of it.\n\nThis changes everything.\n\nTherefore, to compute the number of solutions for a given k, we must count the number of divisors d ofk where gcd(d, k/d)=1.\n\nThus, for example, in the case of k=6:\n\nDivisors are1,2,3,6.\n\nCheck gcd(d,6/d):\n\nd=1: gcd(1,6)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=2:gcd(2,3)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=3:gcd(3,2)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=6:gcd(6,1)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nThus all4 divisors qualify. Thus solutions=4. But earlier we had3 solutions because one was S=1 which was below the threshold.\n\nWait but for k=6 (b=7), the solutions are S=3,4,6. Which corresponds to d=2 gives S=4, d=3 gives S=3, d=6 gives S=6, and d=1 gives S=1. Thus indeed4 solutions, but one is below the required minimum.\n\nThus in this case, the number of solutions is indeed \u03c4(k).\n\nBut in the case of k=12:\n\nDivisors are1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nCheck gcd(d,12/d):\n\nd=1:gcd(1,12)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=2:gcd(2,6)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=3:gcd(3,4)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=4:gcd(4,3)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=6:gcd(6,2)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=12:gcd(12,1)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nThus qualifying divisors are1,3,4,12 \u21d24 solutions.\n\nWhich matches the earlier count of solutions1,4,9,12. Thus the count is4.\n\nThus the number of solutions is the number of divisors d ofk with gcd(d, k/d)=1.\n\nThus to find the number of solutions, we need to count such divisors.\n\nTherefore, to find the minimal b where the number of solutions exceeds10, we need to find the smallest k where the number of divisors d ofk with gcd(d, k/d)=1 exceeds10 plus the number below the sqrt(b).\n\nThis is more complex.\n\nLet me consider k=60 (b=61):\n\nDivisors of60 are1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60.\n\nNow, for each divisor d:\n\nCompute gcd(d,60/d):\n\nd=1:gcd(1,60)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=2:gcd(2,30)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=3:gcd(3,20)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=4:gcd(4,15)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=5:gcd(5,12)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=6:gcd(6,10)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=10:gcd(10,6)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=12:gcd(12,5)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=15:gcd(15,4)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=20:gcd(20,3)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=30:gcd(30,2)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=60:gcd(60,1)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nThus qualifying divisors are1,3,4,5,12,15,20,60 \u21d28 solutions.\n\nThus the number of solutions is8, not12. So my previous assumption was wrong.\n\nThus for k=60 (b=61), there are8 solutions mod60.\n\nThus the number of solutions in [8,60] is8 -1 (S=1) =7.\n\nWhich contradicts earlier analysis. Wait but according to this, it's7.\n\nHmm, so my earlier detailed analysis for k=60 had7 solutions in8-60.\n\nWait let me recheck:\n\nQualifying divisors for k=60 are d=1,3,4,5,12,15,20,60.\n\nEach gives a solution S mod60:\n\nd=1: S=1 mod60 \u21d21.\n\nd=3:S\u22610 mod3, S\u22611 mod20 \u21d2S=21 mod60 \u21d221.\n\nd=4:S\u22610 mod4, S\u22611 mod15 \u21d2S=16 mod60 \u21d216.\n\nd=5:S\u22610 mod5, S\u22611 mod12 \u21d2S=25 mod60 \u21d225.\n\nd=12:S\u22610 mod12, S\u22611 mod5 \u21d2S=36 mod60 \u21d236.\n\nd=15:S\u22610 mod15, S\u22611 mod4 \u21d2S=45 mod60 \u21d245.\n\nd=20:S\u22610 mod20, S\u22611 mod3 \u21d2S=40 mod60 \u21d240.\n\nd=60:S=60 mod60 \u21d260.\n\nThus the solutions are1,16,21,25,36,40,45,60.\n\nWithin8-60:\n\n16,21,25,36,40,45,60 \u21d27 solutions.\n\nThus count is7, not11.\n\nThus my initial mistake was assuming \u03c4(k) gives the number of solutions, but it's actually the number of divisors with gcd(d,k/d)=1, which can be less than \u03c4(k).\n\nTherefore, we need to find the smallest k where the number of such divisors minus those below sqrt(b) exceeds10.\n\nThus we need to find the smallest k where the number of qualifying divisors (d with gcd(d,k/d)=1) minus those below sqrt(k+1) is >10.\n\nLet me try k= 60 (b=61):\n\nNumber of qualifying divisors:8. Solutions above sqrt(61)=~7.8 \u21d27. So 7<10.\n\nNext, try k= 120 (b=121):\n\nDivisors of120:1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,20,24,30,40,60,120.\n\nNow compute for each d:\n\ngcd(d, 120/d):\n\nd=1:gcd(1,120)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=2:gcd(2,60)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=3:gcd(3,40)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=4:gcd(4,30)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=5:gcd(5,24)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=6:gcd(6,20)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=8:gcd(8,15)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=10:gcd(10,12)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=12:gcd(12,10)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=15:gcd(15,8)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=20:gcd(20,6)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=24:gcd(24,5)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=30:gcd(30,4)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=40:gcd(40,3)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=60:gcd(60,2)=2 \u21d2 no.\n\nd=120:gcd(120,1)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nThus qualifying divisors are1,3,5,8,15,24,40,120 \u21d28 solutions.\n\nThus the number of solutions mod120 is8.\n\nsqrt(121)=11 \u21d2 S from11 to120.\n\nSolutions below11: S=1.\n\nThus count is8-1=7.\n\nStill not enough.\n\nNext, k= 240 (b=241):\n\nDivisors of240 are many. This might take time, but perhaps it's better to find a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, look for k which is a product of distinct primes, as then the qualifying divisors are more.\n\nFor example, k being square-free with many prime factors.\n\nLet me try k= 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210 (b=211).\n\nDivisors of210:1,2,3,5,6,7,10,14,15,21,30,35,42,70,105,210.\n\nCheck each d:\n\nd=1:gcd(1,210)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=2:gcd(2,105)=1? gcd(2,105)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=3:gcd(3,70)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=5:gcd(5,42)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=6:gcd(6,35)=1 \u21d2 yes (6 and35 are coprime).\n\nd=7:gcd(7,30)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=10:gcd(10,21)=1 \u21d2 yes (10 and21 coprime).\n\nd=14:gcd(14,15)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=15:gcd(15,14)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=21:gcd(21,10)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=30:gcd(30,7)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=35:gcd(35,6)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=42:gcd(42,5)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=70:gcd(70,3)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=105:gcd(105,2)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nd=210:gcd(210,1)=1 \u21d2 yes.\n\nThus all divisors qualify because since k is square-free, every d and k/d are coprime.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is \u03c4(210)=16.\n\nsqrt(b)=sqrt(211)=14.52.\n\nThus solutions from15 to210.\n\nThe solutions below15 are those with S <15.\n\nThe solutions are all divisors d's corresponding solutions mod210.\n\nEach divisor d gives S \u22610 modd and S\u22611 mod(210/d).\n\nThe solutions mod210 are:\n\nFor each divisor d:\n\nCompute S mod210.\n\nBut since all are coprime, each gives a unique solution mod210.\n\nThus there are16 solutions in1-210.\n\nSolutions below15:\n\nS=1 (from d=1).\n\nOther solutions:\n\nLet me see for small divisors:\n\nd=2:S\u22610 mod2, S\u22611 mod105 \u21d2S=106 mod210?

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A b-eautiful number is a positive integer n that has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13 it's written as 63, and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly a two-digit number in base b looks like. A two-digit number in base b would be of the form n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a can't be zero, so a is between 1 and b-1, and c is between 0 and b-1. \n\nThe condition given is that the sum of the digits, a + c, must equal the square root of n. So, mathematically, that's a + c = sqrt(n). But since n = a*b + c, substituting that in gives:\n\na + c = sqrt(a*b + c)\n\nHmm, that equation is key here. Let me rearrange it. Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nLet me bring all terms to one side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, that might not be the easiest way to handle this. Maybe rearrange terms:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c = a*b\n\nThen, solving for b:\n\nb = (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c)/a\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Alternatively, perhaps express the original equation as:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nLet me see if I can express this as a quadratic in terms of a or c. Let's try to rearrange for b. Let's see:\n\nFrom (a + c)^2 = a*b + c,\n\nSo, a*b = (a + c)^2 - c,\n\nTherefore, b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a\n\nHmm, so b must be an integer since it's a base. Therefore, [(a + c)^2 - c] must be divisible by a. \n\nAlternatively, maybe think of variables. Let me denote s = a + c, so s is the square root of n. Since n is a two-digit number in base b, its value is between b (when a=1 and c=0) and b\u00b2 - 1 (when a = b-1 and c = b-1). Therefore, n must be between b and b\u00b2 -1, so sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) \u2248 b. Since sqrt(n) is s = a + c, which is an integer, so s must be an integer between ceiling(sqrt(b)) and b-1 + b-1 = 2b-2. Wait, but s = a + c where a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, so the minimum s is 1 (if a=1 and c=0), but since n must be at least b (since it's a two-digit number), so sqrt(n) must be at least sqrt(b). Hmm, maybe that's complicating.\n\nAlternatively, since s = a + c must equal sqrt(n), and n = a*b + c, so substituting s in, we have n = s\u00b2. Therefore, the number n must be a perfect square. So all b-eautiful numbers are perfect squares. That's an important point. So n must be a perfect square, say n = s\u00b2, and also n = a*b + c with a and c digits in base b (so 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1, 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1). Also, s = a + c. \n\nTherefore, combining n = s\u00b2 = a*b + c, and s = a + c. \n\nSo substituting c = s - a into the first equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + (s - a)\n\nSo s\u00b2 = a*b + s - a\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = a*b - a\n\nFactor the right side:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = a(b - 1)\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\na = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the numerator (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1), and the result must be between 1 and b-1. \n\nAlso, since c = s - a must be between 0 and b - 1, because c is a digit in base b. So c = s - a \u2265 0 \u21d2 s \u2265 a, and c = s - a \u2264 b - 1 \u21d2 s - a \u2264 b -1 \u21d2 a \u2265 s - (b -1). But since a is at least 1, so combining these conditions:\n\n1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1,\n\nand\n\ns - (b -1) \u2264 a \u2264 s,\n\nBut a must also be an integer. \n\nHmm, so perhaps the key equation here is a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Since a must be an integer, (b -1) must divide (s\u00b2 - s). Let me think of this as:\n\n(b -1) divides s(s -1). \n\nTherefore, for given s and b, this must hold. \n\nOur goal is to find for each base b, how many such numbers n exist (i.e., how many s and a satisfy the above conditions). Then, we need to find the smallest b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parameterize the problem in terms of s and b, and find for each b, the number of possible s where the equations hold, and then find the minimal b where this count is more than 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express in terms of s. Let me see. Let me think of for a given s, how many bases b can satisfy the conditions. \n\nWait, but the problem is asking for, for each b, how many n (i.e., s) exist such that they satisfy the conditions. So we need to count for each b the number of s where there exists an a (and c = s - a) such that:\n\n1. a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) must be an integer between 1 and b-1,\n\n2. c = s - a must be between 0 and b -1,\n\nAdditionally, n = s\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so s\u00b2 must be between b and b\u00b2 -1. So:\n\nb \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1.\n\nSo s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) \u2248 b.\n\nBut s is an integer, so s can range from ceiling(sqrt(b)) to b.\n\nWait, but since s\u00b2 must be at least b, so s \u2265 sqrt(b). Since s is integer, s \u2265 floor(sqrt(b)) +1 ?\n\nWait, but s can be as low as 2, for example. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, we can find possible b such that the conditions are satisfied. Let me try to see:\n\nGiven s, then a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, so:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nMultiply all terms by (b -1):\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nSo:\n\ns\u00b2 - s \u2265 (b -1)\n\nand\n\ns\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nAdditionally, since n = s\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which requires that b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1. So:\n\nb \u2264 s\u00b2 < b\u00b2\n\nSo s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s < b.\n\nTherefore, s can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I need to approach this systematically.\n\nLet me consider that for each base b, the possible s are integers from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1, since s must be at least sqrt(b) (since n = s\u00b2 \u2265 b) and less than b (since n = s\u00b2 < b\u00b2, so s < b).\n\nFor each s in that range, we can check if there exists an a such that a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) is integer between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a is between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, since a must be an integer, (b -1) divides (s\u00b2 - s). Let me denote d = b -1. Then, d divides s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime, so d must divide either s or s-1, or a product of divisors from each. But since they are coprime, d must divide s*(s-1), so d divides s(s-1). Since d = b -1, so for each s, the possible d (i.e., b-1) must divide s(s -1). \n\nTherefore, for each s, the possible d (b-1) must be a divisor of s(s -1). Then, for each s, the number of possible d (so possible b = d +1) is the number of divisors of s(s-1). But we need to ensure that b is such that s is within the required range (ceiling(sqrt(b)) \u2264 s \u2264 b-1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible s, the possible bases b can be determined, and then we can tally for each b how many s satisfy the conditions, and find when that count exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of for each s, and for each divisor d of s(s-1), set b = d +1, and check whether the conditions on s and b are satisfied (i.e., s is between ceiling(sqrt(b)) and b-1). Then, for each such b, we can count the number of s that contribute to it. \n\nThis might be a feasible approach, but perhaps a bit tedious. Since we need the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, maybe we can look for b such that the number of divisors of s(s-1) for s near b is large enough? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps fix b and compute the number of s for that b.\n\nLet me try this approach.\n\nFor a given base b, the possible s must satisfy:\n\n1. ceiling(sqrt(b)) \u2264 s \u2264 b -1,\n\n2. (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), so (b -1) divides s(s -1),\n\n3. a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) must be between 1 and b-1,\n\n4. c = s - a must be between 0 and b -1.\n\nLet me see if these conditions can be simplified.\n\nFirst, since a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), and since a must be between 1 and b -1, then:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nMultiply through by (b -1):\n\nb -1 \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nSo s\u00b2 - s must be at least b -1 and at most (b -1)^2.\n\nBut also, s must be between ceiling(sqrt(b)) and b -1. \n\nLet me see if the first inequality (s\u00b2 - s \u2265 b -1) is automatically satisfied for s \u2265 ceiling(sqrt(b)). Let me check for s \u2265 sqrt(b):\n\nSuppose s \u2265 sqrt(b). Then s\u00b2 \u2265 b, so s\u00b2 - s \u2265 b - s. Since s \u2265 sqrt(b), then b - s \u2264 b - sqrt(b). Hmm, but that might not be helpful. Let me take an example.\n\nSuppose b = 13, as in the example. Then s can be up to 12. Let's take s=9 (the example). s\u00b2 - s = 81 -9 =72, and b-1 =12. So 72 /12 =6, which is a=6. That works. \n\nAnother example: Let's see if for b=13, how many s's satisfy the conditions.\n\nFirst, s ranges from ceiling(sqrt(13))=4 up to 12.\n\nSo s from 4 to 12.\n\nFor each s from 4 to 12, check if (13-1)=12 divides s(s-1). Let's see:\n\ns=4: 4*3=12. 12 divides 12? Yes. So a=12/12=1. Then c =4-1=3. So n =1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4. 1+3=4. So yes, that works. So 16 is 13-eautiful.\n\nSimilarly s=5: 5*4=20. 20 divided by 12? 20/12 is not integer. So no.\n\ns=6:6*5=30. 30/12=2.5. Not integer.\n\ns=7:7*6=42. 42/12=3.5. Not integer.\n\ns=8:8*7=56. 56/12\u22484.666. Not integer.\n\ns=9:9*8=72. 72/12=6. So a=6, c=9-6=3. That's the example given. 6*13 +3=81. sqrt(81)=9. Correct.\n\ns=10:10*9=90. 90/12=7.5. Not integer.\n\ns=11:11*10=110. 110/12\u22489.166. Not integer.\n\ns=12:12*11=132. 132/12=11. So a=11, c=12-11=1. Then n=11*13 +1=143 +1=144. sqrt(144)=12. 11+1=12. So that works. So s=12 also gives a solution.\n\nSo for b=13, s=4,9,12 work. Wait, so that's three numbers. But in the example, 81 is one of them, and there are two others. Wait, s=4 gives n=16, which is 14 in base 13 (1*13 + 3? Wait, hold on. Wait, a=1 and c=3 for s=4? Wait, no:\n\nWait when s=4, a=(4\u00b2 -4)/12 = (16 -4)/12 =12/12=1, so a=1, c=4 -1=3. So in base 13, that would be 1 and 3, so 13 (base 10) is 1*13 +3? Wait no, n= s\u00b2 =16, so 16 in base 13 is indeed 1*13 +3, so digits 1 and 3. So that works. Then s=12 gives n=144, which is 12^2, in base 13, 144 divided by 13 is 11 with remainder 1, so 11 and 1. So digits 11 and 1. 11 +1 =12, which is sqrt(144). So that works. So total three numbers for b=13. \n\nWait the problem says \"more than ten\", so we need to find a base where there are 11 or more such numbers. \n\nSo maybe I need to find a base where there are 11 or more s values (from ceiling(sqrt(b)) to b-1) such that (b-1) divides s(s-1), and the other conditions hold. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a base b where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1) for many values of s near b. Since s can go up to b-1, so s = b-1 is a possible candidate. Let's see:\n\nTake s = b -1. Then s(s-1) = (b -1)(b -2). Then (b-1) divides (b-1)(b-2), so yes. So a = [(b-1)(b-2)]/(b-1) = b - 2. Then c = s - a = (b -1) - (b -2) =1. \n\nSo for s = b-1, the digits are a = b-2 and c =1, so the number is (b-2)*b +1 = b\u00b2 -2b +1 = (b -1)^2. Which is indeed s squared. So that works. So for every base b \u22652, s =b-1 gives a solution. \n\nSimilarly, s= sqrt(n) =b-1, and n=(b-1)^2. So that's always one solution. \n\nSimilarly, check s = sqrt(b). Wait, but s has to be integer. Maybe s= ceiling(sqrt(b)). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) for s in a certain range. Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of s and b such that (b -1) divides s(s-1). Let me set d = b-1, so d divides s(s-1). Therefore, for each s, the possible d's (which are b-1) must divide s(s-1). So for each s, the number of possible d's (and hence b's) is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1). But we need to ensure that d = b -1 is such that s is between ceiling(sqrt(b)) and b -1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each s, the possible d's (divisors of s(s-1)) can give possible b's, but this seems complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe think of for a given base b, the number of s is equal to the number of integers s between ceiling(sqrt(b)) and b-1 such that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to, for each b, count the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nWe need to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10. \n\nPerhaps the easiest way is to iterate over bases starting from 2 upwards, compute the count for each, and check when it exceeds 10. Since the problem is asking for the minimal such b, maybe it's not too large. Let's try to find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, notice that s and s-1 are coprime (since consecutive integers), so for (b-1) to divide s(s-1), since gcd(s, s-1)=1, then (b-1) must divide s or (b-1) must divide (s-1), or split into factors dividing each. \n\nWait, since s and s-1 are coprime, any divisor of s(s-1) must be a product of a divisor of s and a divisor of s-1. Since they are coprime. So for (b-1) to divide s(s-1), (b-1) must be a divisor of s(s-1), so (b-1) can be written as d1*d2 where d1 divides s and d2 divides (s-1), with d1 and d2 coprime. \n\nBut perhaps this is overcomplicating. Maybe think of for each s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], check if (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nAlternatively, note that for a given b, the number of s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s \u22610 or 1 mod k, where k is a divisor of (b-1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). So either s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s \u22611 mod (b-1). Because if (b-1) divides s(s-1), then either (b-1) divides s or (b-1) divides (s -1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, so the only way (b-1) divides their product is if it divides one of them. \n\nWait, is that true? Wait, since s and s-1 are coprime, yes. Because if a prime divides both s and s-1, it divides their difference, which is 1. So they are coprime. Therefore, if a number divides their product, it must divide one of them. Therefore, (b-1) divides s or (b-1) divides (s-1). \n\nTherefore, for each s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s \u22611 mod (b-1). \n\nBut since s < b, then s \u22610 mod (b-1) would require s =b-1, because s < b. Similarly, s \u22611 mod (b-1) would require s=1, but s must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)) which is at least 2 when b \u22652. Except when b=2, sqrt(2)=~1.414, so ceil(sqrt(2))=2, so s would start at 2. \n\nWait, so let me clarify:\n\nIf (b -1) divides s or (s -1), but s is less than b. So:\n\nCase 1: (b -1) divides s. Since s < b, the only possibility is s = b -1. \n\nCase 2: (b -1) divides (s -1). Then s -1 must be a multiple of (b-1). Since s -1 < b -1 (because s < b), so the only possibility is s -1 =0 \u21d2 s=1. But s must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)). \n\nSo unless ceil(sqrt(b)) \u22641, which only happens when b \u22642 (since sqrt(2)\u22481.414, so ceil(sqrt(2))=2. So for b \u22652, the only s that satisfy either case are s = b-1 (from case1) and s=1 (from case2, but s=1 is only allowed if 1 \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)), which only occurs when b \u22641, which it's not). \n\nWait, that suggests that the only s that works is s = b -1. But in the example given, with b=13, s=9 and s=4 also worked. Wait, so my previous conclusion must be wrong. \n\nWait, I must have made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nThe reasoning that since s and s-1 are coprime, then (b-1) divides s or divides s-1. But actually, the factors of (b-1) can be split between s and s-1. For example, suppose (b-1)=6, which factors into 2 and 3. Then s could be divisible by 2 and s-1 divisible by 3, so that their product is divisible by 6. So the previous conclusion that (b-1) must divide s or s-1 is incorrect. \n\nAh, right, because even if (b-1) has factors that divide s and other factors that divide s-1, then their product would divide s(s-1). So my mistake was assuming that because they are coprime, the entire (b-1) must divide one of them, but actually, factors can be split between them. \n\nTherefore, my previous conclusion was wrong. So that approach is invalid. \n\nHmm, so that complicates things. \n\nAlternative approach: Let me think of s(s-1) must be divisible by (b-1). Let me denote d = b-1. So, d divides s(s-1). \n\nWe need to find s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that d divides s(s-1). \n\nSince d = b -1, and s \u2264 b-1, then s(s-1) can be up to (b-1)(b-2). \n\nSo, for each b, the number of such s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where s(s-1) mod (b-1) =0. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, s can range from s_min = ceil(sqrt(b)) to s_max = b-1. \n\nTo count the number of s in that interval where s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nHmm, perhaps it's easier to iterate over b and compute the count. Let me try some small b to see the pattern. \n\nStarting with b=2:\n\nb=2:\n\ns must be between ceil(sqrt(2))=2 and 1 (since b-1=1). But 2 >1, so no s exists. So count=0. \n\nb=3:\n\nceil(sqrt(3))=2 to 2 (since b-1=2). So s=2. Check if 2*(2-1)=2 divides (3-1)=2? 2 divides 2, yes. So s=2 works. So count=1.\n\nn = s\u00b2=4. In base 3, 4 is 11 (1*3 +1). 1+1=2=sqrt(4)=2. So yes. So count=1.\n\nb=4:\n\nceil(sqrt(4))=2 to 3.\n\ns=2: 2*1=2. Check divisibility by 3 (b-1=3). 2 mod 3 \u22600. So no.\n\ns=3:3*2=6. 6 mod3=0. So yes. \n\nThus count=1 (only s=3). \n\nCheck n=9, which is 21 in base4 (2*4 +1=9). 2+1=3=sqrt(9)=3. Correct.\n\nb=5:\n\nceil(sqrt(5))=3 to 4.\n\ns=3: 3*2=6. Check divisible by 4 (b-1=4). 6 mod4=2\u22600.\n\ns=4:4*3=12. 12 mod4=0. So yes. \n\nThus count=1 (only s=4).\n\nCheck n=16 in base5 is 31 (3*5 +1=16). 3+1=4. sqrt(16)=4. Correct.\n\nb=6:\n\nceil(sqrt(6))=3 to5.\n\ns=3:3*2=6. Check divisible by 5? 6 mod5=1\u22600.\n\ns=4:4*3=12 mod5=2\u22600.\n\ns=5:5*4=20 mod5=0. So yes.\n\nThus count=1 (s=5).\n\nn=25 in base6 is 41 (4*6 +1=25). 4+1=5. sqrt(25)=5. Correct.\n\nHmm, so up to b=6, the count is always 1 (except b=2 had 0). \n\nWait, but in the example, b=13 had 3 numbers. So maybe when b increases, the count can be higher. Let's check b=10.\n\nb=10:\n\nceil(sqrt(10))=4 to 9.\n\nNeed s from 4 to9.\n\nCheck for each s from 4-9 whether s(s-1) divisible by 9 (since b-1=9).\n\ns=4:4*3=12 mod9=3\u22600\n\ns=5:5*4=20 mod9=2\u22600\n\ns=6:6*5=30 mod9=3\u22600\n\ns=7:7*6=42 mod9=6\u22600\n\ns=8:8*7=56 mod9=2\u22600 (since 9*6=54, 56-54=2)\n\ns=9:9*8=72 mod9=0. So yes.\n\nThus only s=9. Count=1. Hmm, still 1.\n\nHmm, so maybe when b is one more than a prime? Not sure.\n\nWait, let's check b=13 as given:\n\nb=13, so d=12.\n\nLooking for s from 4 to12:\n\ns=4: 4*3=12 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ns=5:5*4=20 mod12=8\u22600\n\ns=6:6*5=30 mod12=6\u22600\n\ns=7:7*6=42 mod12=6\u22600 (since 12*3=36, 42-36=6)\n\ns=8:8*7=56 mod12: 56-48=8 mod12\u22600\n\ns=9:9*8=72 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ns=10:10*9=90 mod12=6 (90-72=18, 18 mod12=6\u22600)\n\ns=11:11*10=110 mod12: 110-96=14 mod12=2\u22600\n\ns=12:12*11=132 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus s=4,9,12. So count=3. \n\nAh, so for b=13, it's 3. So why does this happen? Because 12 (d=12) has factors that can divide s or s-1 in different ways. \n\nSo for s=4, 4*3=12 which is exactly 12, so divisible by 12.\n\nFor s=9: 9*8=72 divisible by12 (72/12=6).\n\ns=12:12*11 divisible by12.\n\nSo in this case, s=4 works because s-1=3 and 12 divides 4*3. Since 12 divides 4*3, but 12 is 4*3, so yes. \n\nWait, so here, since d=12, which factors into 3 and 4, so s=4 (which is divisible by 4) and s-1=3 (divisible by 3). So 3*4 divides s(s-1). \n\nSimilarly, s=9: 9 is divisible by 3 (since 12=3*4), and 8 is divisible by 4? Wait, 8 is divisible by 4. So 3 and 4 divide s and s-1? Wait s=9, s-1=8. So 3 divides 9 and 4 divides 8. Since 3 and 4 are coprime, their product divides s(s-1). \n\nSimilarly, s=12, s-1=11. 12 divides 12*11, obviously.\n\nThus, for b=13, since d=12 has multiple factors, there are more s's that satisfy the condition. \n\nSo perhaps when d = b-1 has many factors, then there are more s's. So to maximize the count, we need d to have many factors, so that s(s-1) can be divisible by d in multiple ways. \n\nSo maybe the minimal b is when d = b-1 is a highly composite number. Let's check d=12 (as in b=13) gives count 3, which is better. Let's try with higher d.\n\nLet me try b=16, so d=15.\n\nThen s ranges from ceil(sqrt(16))=4 to 15.\n\nCheck for each s from 4 to15 whether s(s-1) divisible by15.\n\n15 factors into 3 and5.\n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by15. Since 3 and5 are coprime, so either 3 divides s or s-1, and 5 divides s or s-1.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\nEither:\n\n- 3 divides s and 5 divides s,\n\n- 3 divides s and 5 divides s-1,\n\n- 3 divides s-1 and 5 divides s,\n\n- 3 divides s-1 and 5 divides s-1.\n\nThus:\n\nCase1: s \u22610 mod3 and s\u22610 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod15.\n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 solve for s \u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod5.\n\nCase3: s\u22612 mod3 and s\u22610 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22612 mod3 and s\u22610 mod5.\n\nCase4: s\u22611 mod3 and s\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod lcm(3,5)=15 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod15.\n\nSo solutions for s in 4-15:\n\nCase1: s divisible by15. s=15.\n\nCase2: Find s \u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet me solve s \u22611 mod5 \u21d2 s=5k+1. Then 5k+1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d25k \u2261-1 mod3 \u21d22k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1. So s=5*(3m+1)+1=15m+6. For s \u226415, m=0 \u21d2s=6; m=1 \u21d221>15. So s=6.\n\nCase3: s \u22610 mod5 and s\u22612 mod3.\n\ns=5k. 5k \u22612 mod3 \u21d25k mod3\u22612 \u21d22k \u22612 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2 s=5*(3m+1)=15m+5. For s \u226415: m=0 \u21d25; m=1\u21d220>15. So s=5.\n\nCase4: s\u22611 mod15 \u21d2s=1,16,... but s must be \u22654 and \u226415. So s=1 is too small, next is 16>15. So none here.\n\nThus total solutions:\n\ns=5 (case3), s=6 (case2), s=15 (case1). \n\nAlso, check s=15 is allowed (since s_max=15). So s=5,6,15. \n\nWait, but also check directly:\n\ns=4: 4*3=12 \u219212 mod15\u22600.\n\ns=5:5*4=20 mod15=5\u22600? Wait 20 mod15=5, which isn't 0. Wait but according to case3, s=5 should work?\n\nWait, s=5:\n\ns=5, s-1=4. s(s-1)=20. 20 mod15=5\u22600. Wait, contradiction. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait in case3, we had s=5*(3m+1). For m=0, s=5. Then s=5, which gives s(s-1)=5*4=20, which is not divisible by 15. Hmm, so my mistake must be in solving.\n\nWait, let me re-examine case3:\n\nCase3: s \u22610 mod5 and s\u22612 mod3.\n\nSo s=5k. Then 5k \u22612 mod3 \u21d25k \u22612 mod3 \u21d2since 5\u22612 mod3, so 2k \u22612 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3. So k=3m+1 \u21d2 s=5*(3m+1)=15m +5.\n\nThen s=5*(1)=5. Let's check 5 mod3=2, which is correct. So s=5 mod3=2, which is correct. But s(s-1)=5*4=20, which mod15 is 5\u22600. Hmm, so why?\n\nAh, because even though s is divisible by5 and s\u22612 mod3, the product s(s-1) is divisible by5 and by2 (since s-1=4\u22611 mod3, but 2 mod3?), but 15 requires 3 and5. Wait 5 divides s, and 3 divides s-1?\n\nWait s=5, s-1=4. 4 mod3=1. So 3 does not divide s-1. So 3 divides s(s-1) only if 3 divides s or s-1. Since s=5 mod3 is 2, so s-1=4 mod3=1. So 3 divides neither. Wait but in case3, we were trying to get 5 divides s and 3 divides s-1? Wait no, in case3 I think I might have mixed up.\n\nWait, original division of cases:\n\nThe requirement is that 3 divides s or s-1, and 5 divides s or s-1. So in case3, I was considering 3 divides s-1 and 5 divides s.\n\nAh, right. So 3 divides s-1 and 5 divides s. So s \u22611 mod3 and s\u22610 mod5. \n\nWait, my mistake earlier was in the setup.\n\nWait let me re-express the cases properly.\n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by 3 and by5. Since 15 divides it. \n\nSo for divisibility by3: either s\u22610 mod3 or s\u22611 mod3 (since s-1\u22610 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod3).\n\nSimilarly for divisibility by5: either s\u22610 mod5 or s\u22611 mod5.\n\nTherefore, the four cases are:\n\n1. s \u22610 mod3 and s\u22610 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod15.\n\n2. s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\n3. s\u22611 mod3 and s\u22610 mod5.\n\n4. s\u22611 mod3 and s\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod15.\n\nWait I had the cases reversed earlier. So case3 is s\u22611 mod3 and s\u22610 mod5. So:\n\nCase3: s \u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nSo solving s=5k, and 5k \u22611 mod3 \u21d25k mod3=2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d22k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2 s=5*(3m+2)=15m +10. \n\nThus for m=0: s=10, m=1:25>15. So s=10.\n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns=3k, 3k \u22611 mod5 \u21d23k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22612 mod5 (since 3*2=6\u22611 mod5). So k=5m +2 \u21d2s=3*(5m+2)=15m +6. For m=0:6, m=1:21>15 \u21d2 s=6.\n\nCase1: s\u22610 mod15 \u21d2s=15.\n\nCase4: s\u22611 mod15 \u21d2s=1,16,... but 1 is too low, so none in range.\n\nThus the valid s are 6 (case2), 10 (case3), 15 (case1). \n\nLet me check these:\n\ns=6:6*5=30 mod15=0. Yes.\n\ns=10:10*9=90 mod15=0. Yes.\n\ns=15:15*14=210 mod15=0. Yes.\n\nAdditionally, check s=5:\n\nWait s=5:5*4=20 mod15=5\u22600. Not divisible. So my initial mistake was in the case analysis. \n\nThus for b=16, s can be 6,10,15. So count=3.\n\nWait, but let's also check s=15:\n\ns=15 is within ceil(sqrt(16))=4 to15. So yes. \n\nSo total 3 numbers. Hmm, so same as b=13.\n\nWait maybe try a higher d with more factors. Let's try d=24 (so b=25). Then d=24, factors into 2^3*3. So more factors.\n\nThen s ranges from ceil(sqrt(25))=5 to24.\n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by24. So 24 divides s(s-1). \n\n24=8*3. So need s(s-1) divisible by8 and by3. \n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even, so at least divisible by2. To get divisibility by8, need either s or s-1 divisible by8, or one divisible by4 and another divisible by2. \n\nAlso, for divisibility by3, either s or s-1 divisible by3.\n\nLet me think of the cases. \n\nAlternatively, since 24 divides s(s-1), so s(s-1) must be divisible by 3 and 8. \n\nLet me first consider divisibility by 3: either s \u22610 mod3 or s\u22611 mod3.\n\nDivisibility by8: need s(s-1) divisible by8. Since s and s-1 are consecutive, one even and one odd. The even one must be divisible by8 or the even one divisible by4 and the other even? Wait no, since one is even, the other is odd. \n\nWait the even number must be divisible by8, or the even number divisible by4 and the other (odd) divisible by2? No, since the other is odd. \n\nWait, to get divisibility by8, the even term must be divisible by8. Because the other term is odd. Since even * odd \u22610 mod8 only if the even term is divisible by8. \n\nWait, let me see: Let me suppose s is even. Then s is divisible by8, then s(s-1) divisible by8. If s is not divisible by8, then s must be divisible by4 and (s-1) is odd, so no. Wait, no:\n\nWait let me think of s even:\n\nCase1: s even:\n\nThen s divisible by8 \u21d2 then yes.\n\nOr s divisible by4 but not 8, then s(s-1) divisible by4*(something odd). So 4 divides it but not necessarily 8.\n\nIf s divisible by2 but not 4 \u21d2 then s(s-1) divisible by2*(odd) \u21d2 only 2 divides it.\n\nCase2: s odd \u21d2 s-1 even. Then s-1 must be divisible by8.\n\nSo overall, for divisibility by8:\n\nEither s \u22610 mod8 or s\u22611 mod8.\n\nThus, to have s(s-1) divisible by24, s must satisfy:\n\nEither:\n\n1. s \u22610 mod8 and (s \u22610 or1 mod3),\n\n2. s\u22611 mod8 and (s \u22610 or1 mod3),\n\nAdditionally, the other divisibility conditions.\n\nAlternatively, combining divisibility by3 and8:\n\nWe can consider all cases modulo 24, but that might take time. Alternatively, count all s between 5 and24 such that s(s-1) divisible by24.\n\nLet me list s from5 to24 and check:\n\ns=5:5*4=20 \u219220 mod24\u22600\n\ns=6:6*5=30 mod24=6\u22600\n\ns=7:7*6=42 mod24=18\u22600\n\ns=8:8*7=56 mod24=8\u22600\n\nWait 56 mod24 is 56-2*24=8. Not divisible by24.\n\nWait, need 24 divides s(s-1). Let's check s=9:\n\n9*8=72 mod24=0. So yes.\n\ns=9: yes.\n\ns=10:10*9=90 mod24=90-3*24=90-72=18\u22600.\n\ns=11:11*10=110 mod24=110-4*24=110-96=14\u22600.\n\ns=12:12*11=132 mod24=132-5*24=132-120=12\u22600.\n\ns=13:13*12=156 mod24=156-6*24=156-144=12\u22600.\n\ns=14:14*13=182 mod24=182-7*24=182-168=14\u22600.\n\ns=15:15*14=210 mod24=210-8*24=210-192=18\u22600.\n\ns=16:16*15=240 mod24=0. Yes.\n\ns=17:17*16=272 mod24=272-11*24=272-264=8\u22600.\n\ns=18:18*17=306 mod24=306-12*24=306-288=18\u22600.\n\ns=19:19*18=342 mod24=342-14*24=342-336=6\u22600.\n\ns=20:20*19=380 mod24=380-15*24=380-360=20\u22600.\n\ns=21:21*20=420 mod24=420-17*24=420-408=12\u22600.\n\ns=22:22*21=462 mod24=462-19*24=462-456=6\u22600.\n\ns=23:23*22=506 mod24=506-21*24=506-504=2\u22600.\n\ns=24:24*23=552 mod24=0. Yes.\n\nSo the s that work are s=9,16,24. \n\nCheck s=9: in base25, n=81, which is 3*25 + 6=81? Wait 24 base25 digits: a = (s\u00b2 - s)/24 = (81 -9)/24 =72/24=3. So a=3, c=9-3=6. So 36 in base25 is 3*25 +6=81. 3+6=9. Correct.\n\nSimilarly s=16: a=(256 -16)/24=240/24=10. c=16-10=6. So digits 10 and6. In base25, that's 10*25 +6=256. sqrt(256)=16. 10+6=16. Correct.\n\ns=24: a=(576-24)/24=552/24=23. c=24-23=1. 23*25 +1=575 +1=576. sqrt(576)=24. 23+1=24. Correct.\n\nThus count=3. Hmm, still 3.\n\nHmm, maybe need a higher b. Let me try d=20 (b=21). Let's see.\n\nd=20 (b=21). So need s from ceil(sqrt(21))=5 to20.\n\ns(s-1) divisible by20.\n\n20=4*5. So s(s-1) must be divisible by4 and5.\n\nDivisible by4: since s and s-1 are consecutive, one even. To get divisible by4, the even one must be divisible by4. So either s\u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4 (since s-1\u22610 mod4).\n\nDivisible by5: s\u22610 mod5 or s\u22611 mod5.\n\nThus, possible cases:\n\nEither:\n\n1. s \u22610 mod4 and s\u22610 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod20,\n\n2. s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod5,\n\n3. s\u22611 mod4 and s\u22610 mod5,\n\n4. s\u22611 mod4 and s\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod20.\n\nLet me solve each case:\n\nCase1: s\u22610 mod20 \u21d2 s=20.\n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet s=4k. 4k\u22611 mod5 \u21d24k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22614^{-1}*1 mod5. Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5 \u21d24^{-1}=4 mod5. So k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k=5m +4 \u21d2s=4*(5m +4)=20m +16. Within 5-20:\n\nm=0 \u21d216; m=1 \u21d236>20 \u21d2 only 16.\n\nCase3: s\u22611 mod4 and s\u22610 mod5.\n\nLet s=5k. 5k\u22611 mod4 \u21d25\u22611 mod4 \u21d21*k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2k=4m +1 \u21d2s=5*(4m+1)=20m +5. Within 5-20:\n\nm=0 \u21d25; m=1 \u21d225>20 \u21d25.\n\nCase4: s\u22611 mod20 \u21d2s=1,21,... \u21d2 only s=1 too low, so none.\n\nThus s=5,16,20.\n\nCheck:\n\ns=5:5*4=20 divisible by20? 20 mod20=0 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=16:16*15=240 mod20=0 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=20:20*19=380 mod20=0 \u21d2 yes.\n\nThus count=3 again.\n\nHmm, so 3 again. Maybe need to try a different approach. \n\nPerhaps try to find a base where d=b-1 is a factorial number, like 6, 24, etc. But even with 24, we only got 3 counts. \n\nAlternatively, let's try b= 12, so d=11.\n\nWait, but 11 is prime. So s(s-1) divisible by11 \u21d2 either s\u22610 mod11 or s\u22611 mod11.\n\ns ranges from 4 to11 (since b=12, sqrt(12)=3.464 so ceil is4).\n\nSo s=4 to11.\n\nCheck:\n\ns=11: s=11 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod11 \u21d2 yes. \n\ns=1: s=1 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod11 \u21d2 but s starts at4.\n\nThus only s=11. So count=1.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nWait let's try d=6 (b=7). \n\nd=6. So s from3 to6.\n\ns=3:3*2=6 divisible by6 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=4:4*3=12 divisible by6 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=5:5*4=20 mod6=2 \u21d2 no.\n\ns=6:6*5=30 divisible by6 \u21d2 yes.\n\nSo s=3,4,6. Thus count=3.\n\nWait for b=7, the count is3. Wait, but earlier for b=13, count was3. \n\nWait let me check for b=7:\n\ns=3: n=9, which is 12 in base7 (1*7 +2=9). 1+2=3. Correct.\n\ns=4: n=16, which is 22 in base7 (2*7 +2=16). 2+2=4. Correct.\n\ns=6: n=36, which is 51 in base7 (5*7 +1=36). 5+1=6. Correct.\n\nSo count=3. \n\nHmm, so perhaps when d has more factors, but also when the range of s is larger?\n\nWait let's try b= 25 (d=24). Wait we did that and got count=3. \n\nHmm, maybe try d= 12 (b=13) which also had count=3. \n\nWait maybe I need a larger base. Let me try b= 25 (d=24), already did that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try b= 10. Wait already did. \n\nWait, let's think differently. The number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of d =b-1 in the range of s(s-1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the count is equal to the number of divisors of d (b-1) that can be expressed as s or s-1. \n\nAlternatively, the count is the number of integers s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 such that s \u22610 or1 mod any of the divisors of d?\n\nHmm, this is getting too vague. Maybe the problem is that the count is small for small b, and increases as b increases. Maybe we need to look for a base where the range of s is large enough and d has many factors.\n\nAlternatively, let's try b= 36 (d=35). \n\nd=35=5*7. \n\ns ranges from ceil(sqrt(36))=6 to35.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by35 \u21d2 divisible by5 and7.\n\nDivisible by5: s\u22610 mod5 or s\u22611 mod5.\n\nDivisible by7: s\u22610 mod7 or s\u22611 mod7.\n\nThus, four cases:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22610 mod7 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod35,\n\n2. s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod7,\n\n3. s\u22611 mod5 and s\u22610 mod7,\n\n4. s\u22611 mod5 and s\u22611 mod7 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod35.\n\nLet me find s in 6-35:\n\nCase1: s=35 (since 35 is within 6-35).\n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod7.\n\nLet s=5k. 5k\u22611 mod7 \u21d25k \u22611 mod7 \u21d2k\u22613 mod7 (since 5*3=15\u22611 mod7). So k=7m +3 \u21d2s=5*(7m +3)=35m +15. Within 6-35:\n\nm=0 \u21d215; m=1 \u21d250>35 \u21d2 only15.\n\nCase3: s\u22611 mod5 and s\u22610 mod7.\n\nLet s=7k. 7k\u22611 mod5 \u21d27k \u22612k\u22611 mod5 \u21d22k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22613 mod5 \u21d2k=5m +3 \u21d2s=7*(5m +3)=35m +21. Within 6-35:\n\nm=0 \u21d221; m=1 \u21d256>35 \u21d221.\n\nCase4: s\u22611 mod35 \u21d2s=1,36,\u2026 so only s=36 is over.\n\nThus s=15,21,35.\n\nCheck:\n\ns=15:15*14=210 divisible by35? 210/35=6 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=21:21*20=420 divisible by35 \u21d2420/35=12 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=35:35*34=1190 divisible by35 \u21d21190/35=34 \u21d2 yes.\n\nAdditionally check s=7:\n\nWait s=7 is in the range 6-35, but s=7:\n\n7*6=42 mod35=7 \u21d2 not divisible by35.\n\nSimilarly s=5: below 6.\n\nSo total count=3 again.\n\nHmm. Maybe try d= 24 (b=25). Wait already did that. \n\nHmm, perhaps this approach isn't working. Let me think of another way.\n\nThe equation is a = (s^2 - s)/(b-1). \n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, then:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1 \u21d2\n\nMultiply all terms by (b-1):\n\nb -1 \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nLet me rearrange the left inequality:\n\ns\u00b2 - s \u2265 b -1 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s +1 \u2265 b.\n\nSimilarly, the right inequality:\n\ns\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b-1)^2 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s - (b-1)^2 \u22640.\n\nBut since b must be at least s\u00b2 - s +1 (from the first inequality), substitute b into the second inequality:\n\ns\u00b2 - s - ( (s\u00b2 - s +1) -1 )^2 \u22640 ?\n\nWait, that might not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps express b in terms of s and a.\n\nFrom the equation a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1) \u21d2 b = 1 + (s\u00b2 - s)/a.\n\nSince a is between 1 and b-1, so a can range from1 to (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1). Wait this is circular.\n\nAlternatively, since a must be an integer between1 and b-1, then for a given s, possible b's are divisors of s(s-1) plus1. \n\nWait, for a given s, the possible b's are those where b-1 divides s(s-1), so b-1 is a divisor of s(s-1). Thus, for each s, the number of possible b's is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1), each divisor d gives b =d+1. \n\nBut since b must satisfy that s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. \n\nTherefore, for each s, the valid b's are those where d = b-1 divides s(s-1), and ceil(sqrt(d+1)) \u2264 s \u2264d. \n\nHmm, this seems complex, but maybe we can think of for each s, how many divisors d of s(s-1) satisfy ceil(sqrt(d+1)) \u2264 s \u2264d.\n\nAlternatively, for a given s, the maximum d can be s(s-1), so b can be up to s(s-1)+1. \n\nBut perhaps this is too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of b-eautiful numbers for a base b is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nTo find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps I need to find a b where there are many s in that interval such that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). \n\nPerhaps b-1 should be a number with many divisors, so that s(s-1) can be divisible by it in multiple ways. The more divisors (b-1) has, the more possible s's there can be. \n\nThe number of divisors is maximized when (b-1) is a highly composite number. The highly composite numbers are numbers with more divisors than any smaller number. The first few are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, etc. \n\nLet me try b-1=60 (so b=61). Let's see.\n\nd=60, which factors into 2^2*3*5. So divisors are numerous. Let's see how many s satisfy the conditions.\n\nFirst, s ranges from ceil(sqrt(61))=8 to60.\n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by60. \n\n60 factors into 4*3*5. So need divisible by4,3,5.\n\nDivisible by4: same as before. Either s\u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4.\n\nDivisible by3: s\u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nDivisible by5: s\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nSo need to satisfy all three conditions.\n\nThis is going to be a bit involved, but let me try to compute the number of s between8 and60 where s(s-1) divisible by60.\n\nTo do this, perhaps use inclusion-exclusion or consider the congruence conditions.\n\nAlternatively, since this is time-consuming, perhaps approximate:\n\nSince the number of solutions is roughly proportional to the number of divisors, and 60 has many divisors, maybe the count is higher.\n\nAlternatively, let me see for s from8 to60, how many s satisfy s(s-1) divisible by60.\n\nAlternatively, note that s(s-1) divisible by60 requires:\n\n- divisible by4: s even with s divisible by4 or s-1 divisible by4.\n\n- divisible by3: s divisible by3 or s-1 divisible by3.\n\n- divisible by5: s divisible by5 or s-1 divisible by5.\n\nSo the total number of s in 8-60 satisfying these conditions can be calculated as follows.\n\nLet me think in terms of probability, but perhaps better to compute systematically.\n\nLet me consider the congruence conditions modulo 60, but that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, consider that s must satisfy:\n\nEither:\n\n1. s \u22610 mod4, s\u22610 mod3, s\u22610 mod5,\n\n2. s\u22610 mod4, s\u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod5,\n\n3. s\u22610 mod4, s\u22611 mod3, s\u22610 mod5,\n\n4. s\u22610 mod4, s\u22611 mod3, s\u22611 mod5,\n\n5. s\u22611 mod4, s\u22610 mod3, s\u22610 mod5,\n\n6. s\u22611 mod4, s\u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod5,\n\n7. s\u22611 mod4, s\u22611 mod3, s\u22610 mod5,\n\n8. s\u22611 mod4, s\u22611 mod3, s\u22611 mod5.\n\nWait, but also need to account for divisibility by4,3,5 in a way that covers all conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to iterate over possible residues modulo lcm(4,3,5)=60. \n\nThis would take a while, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, think of the number of solutions as follows:\n\nThe total number is equal to the number of s in [8,60] such that:\n\ns \u22610 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60,\n\nOR s \u22611 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60,\n\nWait no, that's not correct. Actually, the conditions are that for divisibility by4,3,5:\n\nEither s\u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4,\n\nAND (s\u22610 mod3 or s\u22611 mod3),\n\nAND (s\u22610 mod5 or s\u22611 mod5).\n\nSo the total number is the count of s in [8,60] where:\n\n(s mod4 \u2208 {0,1}) AND (s mod3 \u2208 {0,1}) AND (s mod5 \u2208 {0,1}).\n\nThis is a bit involved, but perhaps manageable.\n\nLet me compute the total number of s in [8,60] such that s mod4 is 0 or1, s mod3 is0 or1, and s mod5 is0 or1.\n\nFirst, the total numbers between8-60 inclusive: 60-8+1=53.\n\nNow, compute how many of these satisfy the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, compute the number using inclusion-exclusion.\n\nAlternatively, note that the conditions are:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA: s \u22610 or1 mod4,\n\nB: s \u22610 or1 mod3,\n\nC: s \u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nWe need |A \u2229 B \u2229 C|.\n\nThe total number is equal to the number of s in [8,60] satisfying all three conditions.\n\nTo compute this, perhaps compute for each residue mod lcm(4,3,5)=60, but this might take time.\n\nAlternatively, compute for each modulus:\n\nThe number of s mod4 in {0,1}, mod3 in {0,1}, mod5 in {0,1}.\n\nThe combined modulus is 60. The number of residues mod60 that satisfy the conditions is equal to the product of the number of residues mod4, mod3, mod5:\n\nFor mod4: 2 options (0,1).\n\nFor mod3: 2 options (0,1).\n\nFor mod5: 2 options (0,1).\n\nTotal residues: 2*2*2=8 residues mod60.\n\nEach residue corresponds to a unique combination of the three moduli.\n\nFor each of these 8 residues, we can find how many numbers between8-60 fall into that residue class.\n\nThus, for each of the 8 residue classes mod60 that satisfy the conditions, compute the count in the range and sum them.\n\nLet me list the 8 residue classes:\n\n1. mod4=0, mod3=0, mod5=0 \u21d2 s \u22610 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60 \u21d2 residue0 mod60.\n\n2. mod4=0, mod3=0, mod5=1 \u21d2 s \u22611 mod5, 0 mod4 and3 \u21d2 find s \u22610 mod12 (lcm4,3) and s\u22611 mod5.\n\nFind s \u2261x mod60:\n\nLet\u2019s solve s \u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet s=12k. 12k\u22611 mod5 \u21d212k \u22612k \u22611 mod5 \u21d22k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22613 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+3 \u21d2s=12*(5m+3)=60m+36 \u21d2 residue36 mod60.\n\n3. mod4=0, mod3=1, mod5=0 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod4, 1 mod3, 0 mod5.\n\nFind s \u22610 mod20 (lcm4,5) and 1 mod3.\n\nLet s=20k. 20k \u22611 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k \u22611 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=20*(3m+2)=60m+40 \u21d2 residue40 mod60.\n\n4. mod4=0, mod3=1, mod5=1 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.\n\nFind s\u22610 mod4, s\u22611 mod3 and5.\n\ns\u22611 mod15 (lcm3,5). So s\u22611 mod15 and 0 mod4.\n\nLet s=15k+1. 15k+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u2261-1 \u21d23k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2k=4m+1 \u21d2s=15*(4m+1)+1=60m+16 \u21d2 residue16 mod60.\n\n5. mod4=1, mod3=0, mod5=0 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod4,0 mod3,0 mod5.\n\nFind s\u22610 mod15 and 1 mod4.\n\ns=15k. 15k\u22611 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k=4m+3 \u21d2s=15*(4m+3)=60m+45 \u21d2 residue45 mod60.\n\n6. mod4=1, mod3=0, mod5=1 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod3 and1 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22616 mod15 (since 1 mod5 and 0 mod3: 6 mod15). Also s\u22611 mod4.\n\nSo s\u22616 mod15 and 1 mod4.\n\nLet s=15k+6. 15k+6\u22611 mod4 \u21d215k\u2261-5 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u2261-5 mod4 \u21d23k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2k=4m+1 \u21d2s=15*(4m+1)+6=60m+21 \u21d2 residue21 mod60.\n\n7. mod4=1, mod3=1, mod5=0 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5.\n\nFind s\u22610 mod5, 1 mod3 and4.\n\ns\u22611 mod4 and mod3 \u21d2 lcm(3,4)=12 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod12. Also 0 mod5.\n\nSo s\u22611 mod12 and0 mod5.\n\nLet s=12k+1. 12k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d212k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d212\u22612 mod5 \u21d22k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k\u22612 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+2 \u21d2s=12*(5m+2)+1=60m+25 \u21d2 residue25 mod60.\n\n8. mod4=1, mod3=1, mod5=1 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.\n\nFind s\u22611 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60 \u21d2 residue1 mod60.\n\nThus the 8 residues mod60 are: 0,16,21,25,36,40,45,60 (wait residue60 mod60 is0, but already counted).\n\nWait residues are:\n\n1. 0 mod60,\n\n2.36 mod60,\n\n3.40 mod60,\n\n4.16 mod60,\n\n5.45 mod60,\n\n6.21 mod60,\n\n7.25 mod60,\n\n8.1 mod60.\n\nWait residue1 mod60 is the last case.\n\nNow, for each of these residues, compute the number of terms between8 and60 inclusive.\n\nLet me compute for each residue:\n\n1. residue0 mod60: s=60, which is within 8-60. Only 1 number.\n\n2. residue16 mod60: s=16, 76>60 \u21d2 only16. So 1 number.\n\n3. residue21 mod60:21,81>60 \u21d2 only21. 1.\n\n4. residue25 mod60:25,85>60 \u21d225. 1.\n\n5. residue36 mod60:36,96>60 \u21d236. 1.\n\n6. residue40 mod60:40,100>60 \u21d240.1.\n\n7. residue45 mod60:45,105>60 \u21d245.1.\n\n8. residue1 mod60:1 is below8, so next is61>60 \u21d2 none.\n\nWait but residue1 mod60 would be s=1,61,\u2026 but 1 is below 8 and61 is above60, so none.\n\nWait also, residue0 mod60 is60, which is included.\n\nAdditionally, check residue16 mod60:16 is within 8-60, yes.\n\nSame for others.\n\nThus total numbers:\n\nFor residues 0,16,21,25,36,40,45: each contributes1, except residue1 mod60 contributes0. Total 7 numbers.\n\nWait but that seems low. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait let me check each residue:\n\n1. 0 mod60: 60 \u21d21.\n\n2.16 mod60:16 \u21d21.\n\n3.21 mod60:21 \u21d21.\n\n4.25 mod60:25 \u21d21.\n\n5.36 mod60:36 \u21d21.\n\n6.40 mod60:40 \u21d21.\n\n7.45 mod60:45 \u21d21.\n\n8.1 mod60: none \u21d2 total 7.\n\nHmm, only7 numbers. That's low, but perhaps correct?\n\nWait but 60 is included, which is s=60. Let's verify s=60:\n\ns=60: check if s(s-1)=60*59 divisible by60? 60*59 is divisible by60 \u21d2 yes. \n\nSimilarly s=16:16*15=240 divisible by60 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=21:21*20=420 divisible by60 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=25:25*24=600 divisible by60 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=36:36*35=1260 divisible by60 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=40:40*39=1560 divisible by60 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=45:45*44=1980 divisible by60 \u21d2 yes.\n\nThus 7 solutions. So for b=61 (d=60), the count is7. Still under10. \n\nHmm, need to go higher. Let me try b= 121 (d=120). \n\nWait this might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121? \n\nWait maybe try b= 25 (d=24) gives 3, b=61 gives7. Maybe the next highly composite number is 120 (d=120). Let me try b=121.\n\nd=120. So s ranges from 11 to120.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by120. 120=8*3*5.\n\nDivisible by8: s\u22610 mod8 or s\u22611 mod8.\n\nDivisible by3: s\u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nDivisible by5: s\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThis is going to be complex. Maybe the count is higher here. Let me see:\n\nThe number of solutions is equal to the number of s in 11-120 where s mod8 is0 or1, mod3 is0 or1, mod5 is0 or1.\n\nThe number of residues mod lcm(8,3,5)=120.\n\nEach combination of residues mod8 (0,1), mod3 (0,1), mod5 (0,1) gives 2x2x2=8 residues mod120.\n\nFor each residue, compute how many s in 11-120.\n\nEach residue will occur every 120 numbers. So between11-120, each residue class will have approximately1 (since 120/120=1 per residue). But need to check exactly.\n\nFor example, residue0 mod120: s=120 \u21d21.\n\nResidue1 mod120: s=1,121 \u21d21 is below11, 121 is over \u21d2 none.\n\nSimilarly, other residues:\n\nEach residue will have either0 or1 numbers in the range. So total 8 residues, but likely similar to previous case, maybe 7 or so.\n\nHmm, perhaps not enough.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 121 with 10 or more?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 100. Let me try b=100, d=99.\n\n99=9*11. So factors 9 and11.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by99 \u21d2 divisible by9 and11.\n\nDivisible by9: s\u22610 mod9 or s\u22611 mod9.\n\nDivisible by11: s\u22610 mod11 or s\u22611 mod11.\n\nThus four cases:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod9 and s\u22610 mod11 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod99.\n\n2. s\u22610 mod9 and s\u22611 mod11.\n\n3. s\u22611 mod9 and s\u22610 mod11.\n\n4. s\u22611 mod9 and s\u22611 mod11 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod99.\n\ns ranges from 10 to99.\n\nCase1: s=99.\n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod9, s\u22611 mod11.\n\nLet s=9k. 9k\u22611 mod11 \u21d29k\u22611 \u21d2k\u2261 (1/9) mod11. Since 9*5=45\u22611 mod11 \u21d2 inverse of9 is5. So k\u22615 mod11 \u21d2k=11m+5 \u21d2s=9*(11m+5)=99m+45. Within 10-99:\n\nm=0 \u21d245; m=1 \u21d2144>99 \u21d245.\n\nCase3: s\u22611 mod9 and s\u22610 mod11.\n\nLet s=11k. 11k\u22611 mod9 \u21d211\u22612 mod9 \u21d22k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22615 mod9 \u21d2k=9m+5 \u21d2s=11*(9m+5)=99m+55. Within 10-99:\n\nm=0 \u21d255; m=1 \u21d2154>99 \u21d255.\n\nCase4: s\u22611 mod99 \u21d2s=1,100,\u2026 \u21d2 none.\n\nThus s=45,55,99.\n\nCheck:\n\ns=45:45*44=1980 divisible by99? 1980/99=20 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=55:55*54=2970/99=30 \u21d2 yes.\n\ns=99:99*98=9702 divisible by99 \u21d29702/99=98 \u21d2 yes.\n\nThus count=3 again.\n\nHmm, this is frustrating. Maybe I need to consider a different approach. Let me think.\n\nThe equation is a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1). Since a must be between1 and b-1, then:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1 \u21d2\n\nMultiply by (b-1):\n\nb -1 \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b-1)^2 \u21d2\n\nLeft inequality: s\u00b2 - s \u2265 b-1 \u21d2 b \u2264 s\u00b2 - s +1.\n\nRight inequality: s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b-1)^2 \u21d2 b \u2265 sqrt(s\u00b2 - s) +1.\n\nBut since b must satisfy both inequalities, combining them:\n\nsqrt(s\u00b2 - s) +1 \u2264 b \u2264 s\u00b2 - s +1.\n\nBut since b must also be greater than s (since s \u2264b-1 \u21d2 b \u2265 s+1).\n\nWait, since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1.\n\nHmm, perhaps for a given s, possible b's are between s+1 and s\u00b2 - s +1, but also must satisfy that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nTherefore, for each s, the number of valid b's is the number of divisors of s(s-1) between s and s\u00b2 - s.\n\nWait, since b-1 must divide s(s-1), so d =b-1 must divide s(s-1), and d must be between s and s\u00b2 -s (since b \u2265 s+1 \u21d2d \u2265 s).\n\nWait:\n\nFrom the right inequality:\n\nb \u2264 s\u00b2 - s +1 \u21d2 d =b-1 \u2264 s\u00b2 - s.\n\nThus, d must be a divisor of s(s-1) in [s, s\u00b2 -s].\n\nThe number of such divisors is the number of divisors of s(s-1) in that interval.\n\nTherefore, the total number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is the number of s such that s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, and there exists a divisor d of s(s-1) such that d =b-1.\n\nThus, for each b, the count is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] for which (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nThus, to maximize the count for a given b, we need many s such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nTo have many s, (b-1) should have many divisors, and those divisors should correspond to s(s-1).\n\nAlternatively, if (b-1) is a factorial number or highly composite, it might have many divisors, leading to many s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe take b-1 as a product of consecutive numbers.\n\nWait, let me consider b-1 = s(s-1) for some s. Then, d = s(s-1), so b = s(s-1)+1. Then s would be such that s is between ceil(sqrt(b)), which is sqrt(s(s-1)+1).\n\nHmm, but this might not give many s.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of when (b-1) is a triangular number.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider b-1 = 240 (so b=241). 240 has many factors. Let me see:\n\nd=240, factors are numerous. Let's see how many s between ceil(sqrt(241))\u224815.5 to240 would satisfy s(s-1) divisible by240.\n\nThis could take time, but maybe it's worth a shot.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121. Wait, let me think of the problem differently.\n\nThe problem states to find the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\n\nEach b-eautiful number corresponds to an s such that s = sqrt(n) and n is a two-digit number in base b. Each such s must satisfy s(s-1) divisible by (b-1).\n\nThus, for each b, the number of solutions is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nTo find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps we can look for b such that b-1 has many divisors, so that many s can satisfy the divisibility condition.\n\nThe number of divisors of (b-1) is a good indicator. Let me look for the smallest b where the number of divisors of (b-1) is large enough to allow more than ten s's.\n\nThe number 60 has 12 divisors. Let me try b=61 again, but earlier count was7.\n\nHmm, maybe b-1= 2520 (highly composite number). But that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, try b= 25 (d=24), count=3; b= 36 (d=35), count=3; b= 49 (d=48). Let me try b=49.\n\nd=48=16*3.\n\ns ranges from7 to48.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by48.\n\n48=16*3.\n\nDivisible by16: since s and s-1 are consecutive, one even. To be divisible by16, the even number must be divisible by16 or divisible by8 and the other even?\n\nWait, similar to previous analysis:\n\nDivisible by16: s\u22610 mod16 or s\u22611 mod16.\n\nDivisible by3: s\u22610 mod3 or1 mod3.\n\nThus, four cases:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod16 and s\u22610 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod48.\n\n2. s\u22610 mod16 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\n3. s\u22611 mod16 and s\u22610 mod3.\n\n4. s\u22611 mod16 and s\u22611 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod48.\n\nLet me compute:\n\nCase1: s=48 (within 7-48).\n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod16 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nLet s=16k. 16k\u22611 mod3 \u21d216\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2s=16*(3m+1)=48m+16.

In the range11-120, each residue will have either0 or1 numbers.\n\nFor example:\n\nResidue0 mod120: s=120 \u21d21.\n\nResidue1 mod120: s=1 \u21d2 too low.\n\nResidue8 mod120: s=8 \u21d2 too low.\n\nWait, but need to consider all residues that satisfy the conditions:\n\nFor example:\n\nCase where mod8=0, mod3=0, mod5=0 \u21d2 residue0 mod120: 120 \u21d21.\n\nCase mod8=0, mod3=0, mod5=1 \u21d2 residue x mod120.\n\nThis requires solving:\n\ns\u22610 mod8, 0 mod3,1 mod5.\n\ns=24k (lcm8,3=24). 24k \u22611 mod5 \u21d224\u22614 mod5 \u21d24k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22614^{-1}*1 mod5 \u21d24^{-1}=4 mod5 (since4*4=16\u22611 mod5). So k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+4 \u21d2s=24*(5m+4)=120m+96 \u21d2 within11-120: m=0 \u21d296; m=1 \u21d2216>120 \u21d296.\n\nSimilarly, other cases will give s values like 40, 60, etc.\n\nThis will take time, but perhaps the total number of s is 8 or so. \n\nAlternatively, maybe b= 100 has 10 solutions. Let me try b=100, d=99.\n\nWait previously got count3. \n\nHmm, I might be missing a pattern here. Maybe I need to consider smaller bases where the range of s is larger.\n\nWait let's try b= 100, but d=99. Wait no, already tried.\n\nWait let's try b= 210 (d=209). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of when d = b-1 is a multiple of many numbers, allowing more s's.\n\nWait another idea: For each s from 2 to some upper limit, the number of b's for which s is a solution is equal to the number of divisors of s(s-1) in the range [s, s\u00b2 - s]. \n\nThus, to find the total count for a particular b, it's the number of s such that (b-1) divides s(s-1) and s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1.\n\nTo have more than ten solutions, there must be at least 11 s's for that b.\n\nPerhaps the minimal such b is when b-1 is 24. Wait but that only gave3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when b-1 is 60, giving7.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to consider that for each s, the possible b's are divisors of s(s-1)+1. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of the following:\n\nFor a given s, the possible b's are those where b = d +1, where d divides s(s-1), and d is between s and s\u00b2 - s.\n\nThus, for each s, the number of b's is the number of divisors of s(s-1) in [s, s\u00b2 -s].\n\nThus, the total number of b's for which there exists an s is the union over all s of these divisors.\n\nBut we need the minimal b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121 with 11 solutions.\n\nWait let me try b= 121 (d=120). \n\nCompute the number of s between 11 and120 where s(s-1) divisible by120.\n\nLet me consider that s(s-1) divisible by120 requires:\n\nDivisible by8: s even and divisible by8, or s odd and s-1 divisible by8.\n\nDivisible by3: s divisible by3 or s-1 divisible by3.\n\nDivisible by5: s divisible by5 or s-1 divisible by5.\n\nLet me compute the number of s from11 to120 meeting these conditions.\n\nLet me consider the following approach:\n\nFirst, compute the total numbers between11-120:110 numbers.\n\nNow, compute the number of s where s \u22610 or1 mod8, mod3, mod5.\n\nThis is similar to previous problems.\n\nThe total number of s that satisfy all three conditions is equal to the number of s in [11,120] such that:\n\ns mod8 \u2208 {0,1},\n\ns mod3 \u2208 {0,1},\n\ns mod5 \u2208 {0,1}.\n\nThe number of such residues mod lcm(8,3,5)=120 is 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 residues.\n\nEach residue occurs every120 numbers.

But I can't see it.\n\nWait let's think of the equation again. For each b, the count is the number of s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nSuppose we choose b-1 to be a factorial number, say 720=6!.\n\nThen b=721.\n\nThen s ranges from ceil(sqrt(721))=27 to720.\n\nThe number of s such that 720 divides s(s-1).\n\nSince 720=16*9*5.\n\nDivisible by16: s\u22610 or1 mod16.\n\nDivisible by9: s\u22610 or1 mod9.\n\nDivisible by5: s\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThis will have many solutions, but calculating is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, notice that for b-1= (s)(s-1), then s(s-1) divides itself, so s is a solution. So for b= s(s-1)+1, the s itself is a solution. Additionally, other divisors may contribute.\n\nFor example, let's choose s=11, then b=11*10+1=111. Then s=11 is a solution.\n\nBut there may be other s's.\n\nWait let me try b= 111 (d=110).\n\nd=110=10*11.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by110 \u21d2 divisible by10 and11.\n\nDivisible by10: s\u22610 mod10 or1 mod10.\n\nDivisible by11: s\u22610 mod11 or1 mod11.\n\nSo four cases:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod10 and0 mod11 \u21d20 mod110 \u21d2 s=110.\n\n2. s\u22610 mod10 and1 mod11.\n\nLet s=10k. 10k\u22611 mod11 \u21d210k\u22611 \u21d2k\u226110^{-1}*1 mod11. 10^{-1}=10 mod11 (10*10=100\u22611 mod11). \u21d2k\u226110 mod11 \u21d2k=11m+10 \u21d2s=10*(11m+10)=110m+100.

Count was3.\n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 100. But earlier count was3.\n\nHmm, this is frustrating. I might need to consider that the first time the count exceeds 10 is at a base where b-1 is a multiple of many numbers, allowing many s.\n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 242 (d=241). 241 is prime.\n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 256 (d=255). 255=3*5*17.\n\ns ranges from16 to255.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by255 \u21d2 divisible by3,5,17.\n\nDivisible by3: s\u22610 or1 mod3,\n\nDivisible by5: s\u22610 or1 mod5,\n\nDivisible by17: s\u22610 or1 mod17.\n\nThis will give 2x2x2=8 cases.\n\nThe total number of solutions would be the number of s in 16-255 meeting all three.\n\nEach residue mod lcm(3,5,17)=255 occurs once every255 numbers.\n\nThus, in 16-255, each residue mod255 will have one occurrence (except for residue0 mod255 which is255).\n\nThus total 8 solutions.\n\nStill low.\n\nHmm, maybe the minimal b is 121 with count7, but the problem requires more than ten.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 256 with 8.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 100 with count7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in earlier calculations.\n\nWait let me try b= 36 (d=35). s from6 to35.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by35 \u21d2 divisible by5 and7.\n\nDivisible by5: s\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nDivisible by7: s\u22610 or1 mod7.\n\nTotal cases:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod5 and0 mod7 \u21d20 mod35 \u21d235.\n\n2. s\u22610 mod5 and1 mod7 \u21d2 s=5k \u21d25k\u22611 mod7 \u21d2k\u22613 mod7 \u21d2k=7m+3 \u21d2s=5*(7m+3)=35m+15 \u21d2 within6-35: m=0 \u21d215; m=1 \u21d250> \u21d215.\n\n3. s\u22611 mod5 and0 mod7 \u21d2 s=7k \u21d27k\u22611 mod5 \u21d27\u22612 \u21d22k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22613 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+3 \u21d2s=7*(5m+3)=35m+21 \u21d2 within6-35: m=0 \u21d221; m=1 \u21d256> \u21d221.\n\n4. s\u22611 mod5 and1 mod7 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod35 \u21d21 \u21d2 too low.\n\nThus s=15,21,35 \u21d2 count3.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait perhaps the minimal b is 121. Let me think of s=12.\n\nWait, let me try b= 13 (count3), b= 25 (count3), b= 36 (count3), b= 49 (count3), b= 64 (count3). \n\nWait maybe there's a pattern here where for b = (s+1)^2, the count increases.\n\nWait let me try b= 100, d=99.\n\nWait let me think differently. The problem requires more than ten b-eautiful numbers. So the count must be at least11.\n\nSuppose that for each s from 2 to b-1, the equation a = (s\u00b2 - s)/ (b-1) must be an integer between1 and b-1. \n\nThus, for each s from2 up to b-1, if (b-1) divides s(s-1), then it contributes a solution.\n\nThus, the count is the number of s in [2, b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nWait, but earlier I considered the lower bound as ceil(sqrt(b)), but maybe that's not necessary. Let me check the original problem's conditions.\n\nThe problem says \"a positive integer n has exactly two digits when expressed in base b\". Thus n must be between b and b\u00b2 -1.\n\nThus, n = s\u00b2 must satisfy b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1 \u21d2 sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) \u2248b-1.\n\nThus s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. Hence my previous analysis is correct.\n\nThus, the count is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nTo have more than ten such s, we need many s in this interval where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nThe more factors (b-1) has, the more s's can satisfy the divisibility.\n\nThe first highly composite number beyond 60 is 120 (d=120, b=121). We saw that gives count7.\n\nThe next is 180 (d=180, b=181).\n\nLet me try b=181 (d=180). 180=2\u00b2*3\u00b2*5.\n\ns ranges from14 (sqrt(181)=~13.45) to180.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by180 \u21d2 divisible by4,9,5.\n\nDivisible by4: s even and divisible by4 or s odd and s-1 divisible by4.\n\nDivisible by9: s\u22610 mod9 or1 mod9.\n\nDivisible by5: s\u22610 mod5 or1 mod5.\n\nThis will have more cases.\n\nThe number of residues mod lcm(4,9,5)=180.\n\nEach combination of mod4 (0 or1), mod9 (0 or1), mod5 (0 or1).\n\nTotal 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 residues mod180.\n\nEach residue occurs once every180 numbers. In the range14-180, each residue will have approximately one number.\n\nThus total 8 solutions. Still low.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the minimal b is 2520 +1=2521, but that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a trick where for some b, the number of solutions jumps.\n\nWait let me think of s and b such that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). Suppose we set b-1 = s-1, so b = s.\n\nThen s(s-1) divisible by s-1 \u21d2 yes, since s(s-1)/(s-1)=s.\n\nThus, for any s >=2, b = s+1 gives a solution s = b-1.\n\nAdditionally, if s(s-1) divisible by (b-1), and if we set b-1 = s, then s(s-1)/s =s-1 must be integer, which it is.\n\nThus for any s, setting b = s+1 gives a solution s = b-1.\n\nAdditionally, for s=2, b=3 gives s=2.\n\nThus, for each b >=2, there is at least one solution s = b-1.\n\nAdditionally, there can be other solutions when (b-1) divides s(s-1) for s <b-1.\n\nThus, to have more than ten solutions, we need at least ten more s values besides s = b-1.\n\nThus, we need nine more s values.\n\nLet me think of b-1 being a number with many factors, so that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1) for many s.\n\nSuppose we choose b-1 = 24 (so b=25), which has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24. So eight divisors.\n\nThus, for each divisor d of24, there may be an s such that s(s-1) is divisible by24. \n\nBut the s must be between ceil(sqrt(25))=5 and24.\n\nThe divisors of24 are up to24.\n\nFor each divisor d of24, there could be s such that d divides s(s-1).\n\nThe number of s where s(s-1) divisible by24 is the count we computed earlier as3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, take b-1= 60 (divisors 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60). 12 divisors.\n\nThus, for each divisor d of60, there might be an s where s(s-1) divisible by60.\n\nBut the count was7.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I need to find a b where b-1 is a factorial number.\n\nLet me try b-1= 720 (b=721).\n\nThen s ranges from27 to720.\n\nThe number of s where s(s-1) divisible by720 would be higher.\n\nBut calculating this is tedious.\n\nAlternatively, notice that for each pair of consecutive integers s and s-1, their product is divisible by many numbers. So for a large b-1, there might be many s.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal b is 121 with count7, but the problem requires more than ten.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in previous counts.\n\nWait let me try b= 100.\n\nWait b=100, d=99=9*11.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by99 \u21d2 divisible by9 and11.\n\nDivisible by9: s\u22610 mod9 or1 mod9.\n\nDivisible by11: s\u22610 mod11 or1 mod11.\n\nThus four cases:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod9 and0 mod11 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod99 \u21d299.\n\n2. s\u22610 mod9 and1 mod11 \u21d2 s=9k. 9k\u22611 mod11 \u21d29k\u22611 \u21d2k\u2261(1/9 mod11). 9*5=45\u22611 mod11 \u21d2k\u22615 mod11 \u21d2k=11m+5 \u21d2s=9*(11m+5)=99m+45 \u21d2 within10-99: m=0 \u21d245; m=1 \u21d2144> \u21d245.\n\n3. s\u22611 mod9 and0 mod11 \u21d2 s=11k. 11k\u22611 mod9 \u21d211\u22612 mod9 \u21d22k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22615 mod9 \u21d2k=9m+5 \u21d2s=11*(9m+5)=99m+55 \u21d2 within10-99: m=0 \u21d255; m=1 \u21d2154> \u21d255.\n\n4. s\u22611 mod9 and1 mod11 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod lcm(9,11)=99 \u21d21 \u21d2 excluded.\n\nThus s=45,55,99. count=3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 121, d=120.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate for b=121 (d=120):\n\ns ranges from11 to120.\n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by120 \u21d2 divisible by8,3,5.\n\nDivisible by8: s\u22610 mod8 or1 mod8.\n\nDivisible by3: s\u22610 mod3 or1 mod3.\n\nDivisible by5: s\u22610 mod5 or1 mod5.\n\nThe total number of residues mod lcm(8,3,5)=120 is 2x2x2=8.\n\nEach residue occurs once every120 numbers.

Perhaps the minimal b is 121 with7 solutions, but the problem says \"more than ten\".\n\nWait maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the count is small for large bases. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think of the equation a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1).

Let me try b= 361 (d=360).\n\nThus d=360=2^3\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75.\n\ns ranges from19 to360.\n\nThe number of s where s(s-1) divisible by360.\n\n360 requires divisible by8,9,5.\n\nDivisible by8 \u21d2 s\u22610 or1 mod8,\n\nDivisible by9 \u21d2 s\u22610 or1 mod9,\n\nDivisible by5 \u21d2 s\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus total cases:2\u00d72\u00d72=8 residues mod lcm(8,9,5)=360.\n\nEach residue occurs once every360 numbers.\n\nThus in 19-360:\n\nEach residue mod360 will occur once (except residue0 mod360 \u21d2360).\n\nThus total8 solutions plus the s=360 \u21d29 solutions.\n\nStill low.\n\nHmm, this is getting me nowhere. Maybe the answer is 121, but the problem states \"more than ten\", so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait let me try b= 100.\n\nWait another idea: For s and s-1 being coprime, so their product's divisors are products of divisors of s and s-1. So for (b-1) to divide s(s-1), (b-1) must be a product of a divisor of s and a divisor of s-1.\n\nThus, for each s, the number of possible b's is the number of ways to factor (b-1) into d1*d2 where d1 divides s and d2 divides s-1.\n\nThus, for each s, the number of b's is the number of such factor pairs.\n\nThus, for a given b, the number of s's is the number of s where (b-1) can be expressed as d1*d2 with d1 dividing s and d2 dividing s-1.\n\nThis is still complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 100 with count 12. Let me try b= 100 again:\n\nd=99=9\u00d711.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by99.\n\nThe s's are 45,55,99 \u21d2 count3.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait let me try b= 25 (d=24).\n\ns ranges from5-24.\n\nThe s's are6,16,24 \u21d2 count3.\n\nWait but maybe I made a mistake in the problem's example.\n\nThe example says 81 is 13-eautiful, which is s=9.\n\nWait, the equation a + c = s = sqrt(n).\n\nThe digits are a and c in base b, so n = a*b +c.\n\nThus, a must be between1 and b-1, and c between0 and b-1.\n\nThus, a = (s\u00b2 -c)/b must be integer between1 and b-1.\n\nWait, but in the equation a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1), this must be integer.\n\nThus, for each s, the possible b's are divisors of s(s-1) +1?\n\nNo, b-1 must divide s(s-1).\n\nThus, the count for b is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] with s(s-1) divisible by (b-1).\n\nPerhaps I need to find a b where b-1 is 24 (d=24), which has 8 divisors, but count3.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait let me try b= 121:\n\ncount7.\n\nb= 2521 (d=2520):\n\n2520 has many divisors. The count could be high.\n\nBut this is impractical to compute manually.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, and the answer is 121, but the problem says \"more than ten\", but 7 is not more than ten.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the earlier calculations. Let me try b= 24:\n\nd=23 (prime).\n\nThus s(s-1) divisible by23 \u21d2 s=23 or s=24.\n\nThus count2.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of b= 120:\n\nd=119=7\u00d717.\n\nThus s(s-1) divisible by119 \u21d2 divisible by7 and17.\n\nDivisible by7: s\u22610 or1 mod7,\n\nDivisible by17: s\u22610 or1 mod17.\n\nThus four cases:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod7 and0 mod17 \u21d20 mod119 \u21d2119.\n\n2. s\u22610 mod7 and1 mod17 \u21d2 s=7k \u21d27k\u22611 mod17 \u21d2k\u226110 mod17 \u21d2s=7*(17m+10)=119m+70 \u21d2 within ceil(sqrt(120))=11 to119 \u21d2 m=0 \u21d270; m=1 \u21d2189> \u21d270.\n\n3. s\u22611 mod7 and0 mod17 \u21d2 s=17k \u21d217k\u22611 mod7 \u21d217\u22613 \u21d23k\u22611 \u21d2k\u22615 mod7 \u21d2k=7m+5 \u21d2s=17*(7m+5)=119m+85 \u21d2 within11-119 \u21d2m=0 \u21d285; m=1 \u21d2204> \u21d285.\n\n4. s\u22611 mod7 and1 mod17 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod119 \u21d21 \u21d2 excluded.\n\nThus s=70,85,119 \u21d2 count3.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Given that the problem is from an Olympiad, perhaps there's a pattern I'm missing.\n\nThe equation is a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1).\n\nSince a must be between1 and b-1:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1) \u2264b-1 \u21d2\n\nb-1 \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b-1)^2 \u21d2\n\ns\u00b2 -s \u2265b-1 and s\u00b2 -s \u2264(b-1)^2.\n\nLet me consider the lower inequality:\n\nb \u2264 s\u00b2 -s +1.\n\nThe upper inequality:\n\nb \u2265 sqrt(s\u00b2 - s) +1.\n\nThus combining:\n\nsqrt(s\u00b2 - s) +1 \u2264b \u2264 s\u00b2 -s +1.\n\nThus for a given s, b can be any integer in that interval.\n\nThus the number of b's for each s is roughly s\u00b2 -s +1 - sqrt(s\u00b2 - s).\n\nBut we need the number of s's for a given b.\n\nAlternatively, for a given b, the valid s's are those where ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264s \u2264b-1 and sqrt(s\u00b2 -s) +1 \u2264b \u2264 s\u00b2 -s +1.\n\nBut this is complex.\n\nAlternatively, for each s, the values of b that satisfy are between sqrt(s\u00b2 - s)+1 and s\u00b2 -s +1.\n\nThus, the number of b's per s is roughly s\u00b2 -s - sqrt(s\u00b2 - s).\n\nTo have multiple s's contributing to the same b, we need overlapping intervals for different s's.\n\nTo maximize the count for a particular b, we need as many s's as possible whose intervals include b.\n\nFor example, for b= (s)^2, then s is in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, let's suppose b= s(s-1)+1, then s(s-1) is divisible by b-1 =s(s-1), so s is a solution. Additionally, other s's might also work.\n\nFor example, take b= s(s-1)+1:\n\nLet s=11 \u21d2 b=110.\n\nThen s=11 is a solution.\n\nAlso check if other s's work.\n\nTake s=10:\n\ns(s-1)=90. b-1=109 \u21d2109 divides90? No.\n\ns=12:\n\ns(s-1)=132. 109 divides132?

Maybe the answer is 121.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier calculation for b= 100.\n\nWait let me try b= 100 again:\n\ns must be between10 and99.\n\nNeed s(s-1) divisible by99.\n\nThus, s must be \u22610 or1 mod9 and mod11.\n\nThus four cases:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod9 and0 mod11 \u21d20 mod99 \u21d299.\n\n2. s\u22610 mod9 and1 mod11 \u21d2 s=9k \u21d29k\u22611 mod11 \u21d2k\u22615 mod11 \u21d2k=11m+5 \u21d2s=9*(11m+5)=99m+45 \u21d2 within10-99 \u21d245.\n\n3. s\u22611 mod9 and0 mod11 \u21d2 s=11k \u21d211k\u22611 mod9 \u21d2k\u22615 mod9 \u21d2s=11*(9m+5)=99m+55 \u21d2 within \u21d255.\n\n4. s\u22611 mod9 and1 mod11 \u21d21 \u21d2 excluded.\n\nThus s=45,55,99 \u21d2 count3.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the problem requires a different approach.\n\nThe equation is s(s-1) divisible by (b-1).\n\nThus, (b-1) divides s(s-1).\n\nThus, for each s, the possible b's are (d+1) where d is a divisor of s(s-1).\n\nThus, the total number of b's for which s is a solution is the number of divisors of s(s-1).\n\nTo have a b with more than ten solutions, there must be more than ten different s's for which (b-1) is a divisor of s(s-1).\n\nThus, (b-1) must be a divisor of many s(s-1) for different s.\n\nThus, choosing (b-1) as a number with many divisors, each of which corresponds to an s.\n\nFor example, if b-1= 24 (divisors 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24), then for each divisor d, there may be an s where d divides s(s-1).\n\nThus, for each divisor d of24, there are s such that s(s-1) divisible byd.\n\nThe number of s for which this holds is roughly the number of divisors.\n\nThus, for b=25 (d=24), there are8 divisors, but the count is3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 121 with count7.\n\nWait perhaps I'm missing cases where s(s-1) divisible by (b-1) can have multiple s's for the same b.\n\nWait, for example, b= 13 (d=12):\n\ndivisors of12:1,2,3,4,6,12.\n\nThus for each divisor d of12, there may be s such that s(s-1) divisible by12.\n\nBut the count was3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 25 with count3.\n\nBut the problem requires more than ten.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait maybe I made a mistake in the problem understanding.\n\nThe problem says \"two digits when expressed in base b\", so n must be between b and b\u00b2-1.\n\nThus s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1.\n\nBut maybe s can be equal to b?\n\nWait n must be two digits, so maximum is b\u00b2-1, so s_max = floor(sqrt(b\u00b2-1)) = b-1.\n\nThus correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the problem has a trick where s and a are related in a way that for each divisor of (b-1), there are two s's.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121 with count7.\n\nBut the problem requires more than ten.\n\nHmm, given that I've tried many bases and the count never exceeds 10, I might have to consider that the minimal b is 121, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 121. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait let me try b= 121 again.\n\nWait s=16: n=256.\n\nIn base121, 256 is 2*121 +14 \u21d2 digits2 and14. 2+14=16. Yes.\n\ns=25: n=625. In base121, 625=5*121 +20 \u21d25+20=25.\n\ns=40: n=1600. In base121, 1600=13*121 + 17 \u21d213+17=30 \u226040.\n\nWait wait that can't be.\n\nWait a = (s\u00b2 -s)/d, where d=b-1=120.\n\nFor s=40:\n\na=(1600 -40)/120=1560/120=13.\n\nc=40-13=27.\n\nThus the digits are13 and27. In base121, the number is13*121 +27= 1573 +27=1600. 13+27=40. Correct.\n\nSimilarly s=81:\n\na=(81\u00b2 -81)/120=(6561-81)/120=6480/120=54.\n\nc=81-54=27.\n\nDigits54 and27. 54+27=81. n=54*121+27=6534+27=6561=81\u00b2.\n\ns=96:\n\na=(96\u00b2 -96)/120=(9216-96)/120=9120/120=76.\n\nc=96-76=20.\n\nDigits76 and20. 76+20=96. n=76*121+20=9196+20=9216=96\u00b2.\n\ns=105:\n\na=(105\u00b2 -105)/120=(11025-105)/120=10920/120=91.\n\nc=105-91=14.\n\nDigits91 and14. 91+14=105. n=91*121 +14= 11011 +14=11025=105\u00b2.\n\ns=120:\n\na=(120\u00b2 -120)/120=(14400-120)/120=14280/120=119.\n\nc=120-119=1.\n\nDigits119 and1. 119+1=120. n=119*121 +1=14399+1=14400=120\u00b2.\n\nThus all these are valid, count is7.\n\nHmm, so maybe I need to try a larger b.\n\nLet me try b= 2521 (d=2520).\n\nDivisors of2520 are many (48 divisors).\n\nThus, there may be many s's.\n\nFor example, s= sqrt(2521)=50.2 \u21d2 s from51 to2520.\n\nThe number of s where s(s-1) divisible by2520.\n\nThis requires s \u22610 or1 mod2,3,4,5,6,7.\n\nThis would give many solutions.\n\nBut without calculating, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps the answer is 121, but since the problem requires more than ten, I might have made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal b is 121 with count7, so perhaps the answer is higher.\n\nWait let me try b= 2521 (d=2520).\n\nAssuming s= sqrt(2521)=50.2 \u21d2 s from51 to2520.\n\nThe number of s where s(s-1) divisible by2520.\n\n2520=2^3*3^2*5*7.\n\nThus:\n\nDivisible by8 \u21d2 s\u22610 or1 mod8,\n\nDivisible by9 \u21d2 s\u22610 or1 mod9,\n\nDivisible by5 \u21d2 s\u22610 or1 mod5,\n\nDivisible by7 \u21d2 s\u22610 or1 mod7.\n\nThus, the number of residues mod lcm(8,9,5,7)=2520 is 2^4=16 residues.\n\nEach residue occurs once every2520 numbers.\n\nThus in 51-2520, there are 16 solutions.\n\nThus count16.\n\nThus for b=2521, the count is16, which is more than ten.\n\nThus the minimal b is 2521.\n\nBut the problem says \"Find the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\"\n\nThus, the first such b is the minimal b where the count exceeds10.\n\nThe first highly composite number beyond 120 is 180 (d=180):\n\nb=181:\n\nd=180=2\u00b2*3\u00b2*5.\n\nThus residues mod lcm(4,9,5)=180 \u21d2 residues mod180.\n\nTotal residues:2\u00d72\u00d72=8 \u21d2 count8.\n\nNext is 240 (d=240):\n\nb=241:\n\nd=240=2^4*3*5.\n\nDivisible by16,3,5.\n\nResidues mod lcm(16,3,5)=240 \u21d2 residues mod240.\n\nTotal residues:2\u00d72\u00d72=8 \u21d2 count8.\n\nNext is 360 (d=360):\n\nb=361:\n\nd=360=2^3*3^2*5.\n\nResidues mod lcm(8,9,5)=360 \u21d2 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 \u21d2 count8.\n\nNext is 720 (d=720):\n\nb=721:\n\nd=720=2^4*3^2*5.\n\nResidues mod lcm(16,9,5)=720 \u21d2 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 \u21d2 count8.\n\nNext is 840 (d=840):\n\nb=841:\n\nd=840=2^3*3*5*7.\n\nResidues mod lcm(8,3,5,7)=840 \u21d2 2\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72=16 \u21d2 count16.\n\nThus the first b with count exceeding ten is b=841 (count16).\n\nThus the minimal b is841.\n\nWait but 840's divisors:\n\nThe number of residues would be 2^4=16 (mod8,3,5,7).\n\nThus count16.\n\nThus b=841 is the first with count16>10.\n\nThus the answer is841.\n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first such b is 2521 (count16).\n\nAlternatively, let's see when the number of residues exceeds10.\n\nFor example, when the number of mod conditions is higher.\n\nIf the number of prime factors increases, the number of residues doubles each time.\n\nThus, when the number of prime factors reaches4, the number of residues is16.\n\nThus, the minimal b where the number of residues exceeds ten is when the number of prime factors is4.\n\nThus, the minimal such b is 841 (d=840).\n\nThus the answer is841.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the",
