      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem about a convex equilateral hexagon where all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. The triangle formed by extending the sides AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200, 240, and 300. I need to find the side length of the hexagon. Hmm, let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, since it's an equilateral hexagon, all its sides are equal in length. Let's call the side length 's'. The problem mentions that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel. In a regular hexagon, opposite sides are indeed parallel, but this isn't necessarily regular because the angles might differ. But here, since it's just equilateral and convex with opposite sides parallel, maybe it's a special kind of hexagon?\n\nThe triangle formed by extending AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. Wait, when they say \"extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF\", does that mean that each of these sides is extended until they meet to form a triangle? So, if we extend AB beyond A and B, CD beyond C and D, and EF beyond E and F, those extensions will intersect to form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given. \n\nLet me try to visualize this. Let me imagine the hexagon ABCDEF. Since opposite sides are parallel, AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA. Wait, no, actually, in a hexagon, opposite sides would be separated by three sides. So in a hexagon ABCDEF, opposite sides are AB and DE, BC and EF, CD and FA. So yes, each pair of opposite sides are parallel.\n\nSo, when we extend AB, CD, and EF, their extensions form a triangle. Let me try to sketch this mentally. Let me denote the triangle formed by the intersection points of these extended sides. Let me call the lines:\n\n- Line l1 is the extension of AB beyond A and B.\n\n- Line l2 is the extension of CD beyond C and D.\n\n- Line l3 is the extension of EF beyond E and F.\n\nThese three lines l1, l2, l3 form a triangle. The sides of this triangle have lengths 200, 240, 300. Let me note that the triangle's sides correspond to the intersections of these three lines. \n\nSince all the sides of the hexagon are equal to 's', perhaps there is a relationship between the side length 's' and the sides of the triangle. Maybe similar triangles are involved here?\n\nAlternatively, since the opposite sides are parallel, the hexagon can be considered as a combination of parallelograms? Hmm, maybe not exactly, but since each pair of opposite sides are parallel and equal? Wait, the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal, but not necessarily that opposite sides are equal in length? Wait, no, in an equilateral hexagon, all sides are equal, but opposite sides can still be parallel. Wait, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are both parallel and equal. Since here the hexagon is equilateral, so all sides are equal, but the problem says \"convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel\". So, opposite sides are both parallel and equal in length? Wait, because in a regular hexagon, they are. But maybe here, even if it's not regular, since opposite sides are parallel and the hexagon is equilateral, then they must also be equal in length? Hmm, perhaps.\n\nWait, but in a general equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, would the opposite sides necessarily be equal? Let me think. Suppose in a hexagon, opposite sides are parallel, but maybe not equal. But since all sides are equal (equilateral), then opposite sides must be equal in length. Because if all sides are equal, then opposite sides, being sides of the hexagon, are equal. So that's redundant. So in this problem, the hexagon is equilateral (all sides equal) and convex, with all opposite sides parallel. So each pair of opposite sides are parallel and equal in length. That's important.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon can be thought of as a centrally symmetric figure? Because if opposite sides are both parallel and equal, then the hexagon is centrally symmetric. That is, there is a point (the center) such that each vertex has an opposite vertex diametrically opposite. So, for example, vertex A is opposite D, B opposite E, C opposite F. Therefore, the center is the midpoint between each pair of opposite vertices.\n\nThis central symmetry might help in solving the problem. Let me note that.\n\nNow, the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me try to think how this triangle relates to the hexagon. Since the sides of the triangle are formed by extending AB, CD, and EF, each side of the triangle is formed by two lines extended from the hexagon's sides. The intersections of these lines form the triangle.\n\nGiven the central symmetry, perhaps there's a way to relate the triangle's sides to the hexagon's sides through ratios?\n\nAlternatively, maybe coordinate geometry would be a good approach here. Let me try to assign coordinates to the hexagon's vertices and express the conditions mathematically.\n\nLet me set up a coordinate system. Since the hexagon is centrally symmetric, let me place the center at the origin (0,0). Let me denote the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F in order. Since it's centrally symmetric, the coordinates of D would be the negative of A, E the negative of B, F the negative of C. So, if A is (x,y), then D is (-x,-y), B is (p,q), so E is (-p,-q), and C is (r,s), so F is (-r,-s).\n\nNow, since all sides are equal length s. The distance between A and B must be s, between B and C must be s, etc. Also, opposite sides are parallel, so vector AB is equal to vector ED, but since ED is from E to D, which is (-p,-q) to (-x,-y). So vector ED is (-x + p, -y + q). Wait, but vector AB is (p - x, q - y). Since they are parallel, but in a centrally symmetric hexagon, vectors AB and ED should be equal? Wait, since the hexagon is centrally symmetric, the vector from A to B should be the same as the vector from D to C? Wait, perhaps I need to think more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, since opposite sides are parallel, the direction of AB is the same as DE. Since DE is opposite to AB. Since the hexagon is centrally symmetric, DE is the translation of AB by the center? Hmm, maybe coordinate geometry is the way to go here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using vectors. Let me consider vectors for the sides. Let me denote vectors AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each of these vectors has length s. Also, opposite sides are parallel, so AB is parallel to DE, BC parallel to EF, and CD parallel to FA.\n\nTherefore, vectors AB and DE are scalar multiples, but since they are parallel and the hexagon is equilateral, they must have the same length, so vectors AB and DE are equal in magnitude and direction? Wait, no. Wait, direction could be opposite? Wait, no. Since opposite sides are parallel, they could be in the same or opposite direction. But in a convex hexagon, probably the direction is same?\n\nWait, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel and pointing in the same direction if you traverse the hexagon. Wait, actually in a regular hexagon, each pair of opposite sides are parallel and separated by three edges, so their direction vectors are the same. For example, in a regular hexagon, AB is from A to B, and DE is from D to E. If you traverse the hexagon, each side is a 60-degree rotation from the previous. So the direction of AB would be same as DE? Let me confirm:\n\nIn regular hexagon, each internal angle is 120 degrees. The direction of each side can be represented as vectors. Let me think of coordinates for regular hexagon centered at origin. Let me suppose vertex A is at (1,0), then moving 60 degrees each time. The direction vectors would be (cos0, sin0), (cos60, sin60), etc. The opposite side to AB would be DE. The direction of DE would be the same as AB if the regular hexagon is symmetric. Wait, actually in regular hexagon, each pair of opposite sides are parallel but pointing in opposite directions? Wait, maybe not. Let me see coordinates.\n\nSuppose regular hexagon with vertices at (1,0), (0.5, sqrt(3)/2), (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2), (-1,0), (-0.5, -sqrt(3)/2), (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). So side AB is from (1,0) to (0.5, sqrt(3)/2). The vector is (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2). The opposite side DE is from (-1,0) to (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2). Wait, no, DE is from D to E. Wait, D is (-1,0), E is (-0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). So DE vector is (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). So DE vector is (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2). Comparing to AB's vector (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2), they are negatives of each other. So opposite sides have vectors pointing in opposite directions. So direction is opposite. Therefore, in a regular hexagon, opposite sides are parallel but opposite in direction.\n\nSo in our problem, the hexagon is equilateral with opposite sides parallel. So their vectors are either same or opposite. But since the hexagon is convex, probably the direction alternates. Hmm, perhaps it's better to use coordinate system.\n\nLet me try to set coordinates with center at origin. Let me suppose that the hexagon is symmetric about origin, so each vertex A has opposite vertex D = -A, etc.\n\nLet me denote the vertices as A, B, C, D, E, F in order. Then coordinates: A (a,b), B (c,d), C (e,f), D (-a,-b), E (-c,-d), F (-e,-f).\n\nSince it's convex and equilateral, all the sides have length s. So the distance between A and B is sqrt[(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2] = s, similarly between B and C, etc.\n\nAlso, opposite sides are parallel. For example, side AB and side DE must be parallel. The vector AB is (c - a, d - b). The vector DE is E to D: from E (-c, -d) to D (-a, -b). So DE vector is (-a + c, -b + d). Which is (c - a, d - b), same as AB. Therefore, the vectors AB and DE are the same. So they are parallel and same direction. Wait, so in this case, opposite sides have vectors in the same direction? Hmm, but in regular hexagon, opposite sides have vectors in opposite directions. Wait, maybe my coordinate system assumption is conflicting with that?\n\nWait, perhaps in my coordinate system, the direction is same. Let me see:\n\nIn regular hexagon, if I place the vertices as I did earlier, then vector AB was (-0.5, sqrt(3)/2), and DE vector was (0.5, -sqrt(3)/2), which is exactly the negative. So in that case, vectors are opposite. But according to my current coordinate system setup, vectors AB and DE would be same. Hmm, so perhaps my coordinate system is different?\n\nWait, in my coordinate system, the opposite vertex of A is D, so D is (-a, -b). The side DE is from D to E, which is from (-a, -b) to (-c, -d). So the vector is (-c + a, -d + b). Wait, maybe I made an error earlier.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the vertices are A (a,b), B (c,d), C (e,f), D (-a,-b), E (-c,-d), F (-e,-f). Then the side DE is from D to E: from (-a,-b) to (-c,-d). So vector DE is (-c - (-a), -d - (-b)) = (a - c, b - d). The vector AB is (c - a, d - b). So DE vector is (a - c, b - d) = - (c - a, d - b) = -AB vector. Therefore, DE is opposite in direction to AB, as in the regular hexagon. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, in this coordinate system, opposite sides have vectors that are negatives of each other, so they are parallel but opposite in direction. So that's consistent with regular hexagons. So that's good.\n\nTherefore, in this setup, the vectors of opposite sides are negatives. So for the sides:\n\nAB vector: (c - a, d - b)\n\nBC vector: (e - c, f - d)\n\nCD vector: (-a - e, -b - f) [Wait, CD is from C to D: from (e,f) to (-a,-b). So vector CD is (-a - e, -b - f)]\n\nWait, but CD should be parallel to FA. Let me check FA vector: FA is from F to A, which is (a + e, b + f). Since FA is from F (-e,-f) to A (a,b). So FA vector is (a + e, b + f). The CD vector is (-a - e, -b - f), which is exactly the negative of FA vector. Therefore, CD is parallel to FA, as required. So that works.\n\nTherefore, in this coordinate system, each pair of opposite sides have vectors that are negatives of each other, so they are parallel and opposite in direction.\n\nSo, with this coordinate system, perhaps I can model the problem.\n\nNow, the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF. Let me think about the lines AB extended, CD extended, and EF extended. Their intersections form a triangle. The lengths of the sides of this triangle are given as 200, 240, 300. We need to find the side length s of the hexagon.\n\nLet me first try to find equations of the lines AB, CD, EF, then find their intersection points, compute the distances between those points, set them equal to 200, 240, 300, and solve for s.\n\nThis might be a bit involved, but let's try.\n\nFirst, let me parameterize the lines. Let me note that lines AB, CD, EF are sides of the hexagon, but when extended, they form the triangle. Let me denote:\n\nLine AB: This is the line passing through points A and B. Since we need the extension beyond A and B, the line is infinite.\n\nSimilarly for CD and EF.\n\nWe need to find the three intersection points of these lines:\n\nLet me denote:\n\nIntersection of AB extended and CD extended: Let's call this point P.\n\nIntersection of CD extended and EF extended: Let's call this point Q.\n\nIntersection of EF extended and AB extended: Let's call this point R.\n\nThen triangle PQR is the triangle with side lengths 200, 240, 300.\n\nWait, but actually, depending on the order, the triangle could be formed by three intersections. Let me confirm:\n\nIf we extend AB, CD, EF, then each pair of these lines will intersect at a point. The three lines (AB, CD, EF) form a triangle with vertices at their intersections. Since the hexagon is convex, the lines AB, CD, EF are arranged such that their extensions meet to form a triangle outside the hexagon.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle is formed by extending the sides beyond the hexagon, so each side of the triangle is formed by the extensions beyond the hexagon's edges.\n\nTherefore, the three lines AB, CD, EF (when extended) form a triangle. Let me denote the three intersection points as follows:\n\nLet me call the intersection of AB extended beyond A and CD extended beyond C as point X.\n\nWait, perhaps better to be precise.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLine AB is the line through A and B. Its extension beyond A would go towards the direction opposite to B, and beyond B towards the direction opposite to A.\n\nSimilarly for CD and EF.\n\nBut to form a triangle, the three lines must intersect each other in three different points. Let me suppose that:\n\nThe lines AB, CD, and EF when extended intersect each other pairwise at three distinct points forming a triangle. Let me call these intersection points as follows:\n\nLet P be the intersection of lines AB and CD.\n\nLet Q be the intersection of lines CD and EF.\n\nLet R be the intersection of lines EF and AB.\n\nWait, but depending on the direction of extension, maybe some intersections are on the extensions beyond the hexagon's edges. Since the hexagon is convex, the lines AB, CD, EF might intersect each other outside the hexagon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle is formed by the three lines extended in such a way. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to assign coordinates and compute the intersections.\n\nLet me proceed step by step with coordinates.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of the hexagon's vertices as follows:\n\nLet me set the center at the origin (0,0), so opposite vertices are negatives of each other.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nA = (a, b)\n\nB = (c, d)\n\nC = (e, f)\n\nD = (-a, -b)\n\nE = (-c, -d)\n\nF = (-e, -f)\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, each side has length s. So the distance between A and B must be s:\n\n\u221a[(c - a)^2 + (d - b)^2] = s,\n\ndistance between B and C: \u221a[(e - c)^2 + (f - d)^2] = s,\n\ndistance between C and D: \u221a[(-a - e)^2 + (-b - f)^2] = s,\n\ndistance between D and E: \u221a[(-c + a)^2 + (-d + b)^2] = s,\n\ndistance between E and F: \u221a[(-e + c)^2 + (-f + d)^2] = s,\n\ndistance between F and A: \u221a[(a + e)^2 + (b + f)^2] = s.\n\nAdditionally, since opposite sides are parallel, their direction vectors are negatives, as we saw before.\n\nNow, the lines AB, CD, and EF are to be extended to form a triangle. Let me find equations for these lines.\n\nFirst, equation of line AB:\n\nIt goes through points A(a,b) and B(c,d). The parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx = a + t(c - a)\n\ny = b + t(d - b)\n\nfor t \u2208 \u211d.\n\nSimilarly, equation of line CD:\n\nIt goes through points C(e,f) and D(-a, -b). The direction vector is D - C = (-a - e, -b - f). So parametric equations:\n\nx = e + s(-a - e - e)? Wait, let me use a different parameter.\n\nWait, parametric equations for CD: starting at point C(e,f), direction vector to D is (-a - e, -b - f). So:\n\nx = e + s*(-a - e)\n\nWait, no: the direction vector is D - C = (-a - e, -b - f). So the parametric equation for CD is:\n\nx = e + s*(-a - e)\n\nWait, actually, the direction vector is from C to D: ( -a - e, -b - f ). So the parametric equation for CD can be written as:\n\nx = e + s*(-a - e)\n\nWait, actually, it's better to write it as:\n\nx = e + s*(-a - e) ?\n\nWait no, perhaps using a parameter s starting at C:\n\nx = e + s*(-a - e), y = f + s*(-b - f). Wait, that would go from C towards D when s=1. But for the line CD extended, we can use another parameter.\n\nAlternatively, use a parameter like:\n\nx = e + s*( -a - e - e? Hmm, maybe better to use a different parameter.\n\nAlternatively, let me use parameter s such that when s=0, it's at point C(e,f), and when s=1, it's at D(-a,-b). So:\n\nx = e + s*(-a - e)\n\ny = f + s*(-b - f)\n\nfor s \u2208 \u211d.\n\nSimilarly, for line EF:\n\nPoints E(-c,-d) and F(-e,-f). The direction vector is F - E = (-e + c, -f + d). So parametric equations:\n\nx = -c + t*(-e + c)\n\ny = -d + t*(-f + d)\n\nfor t \u2208 \u211d.\n\nNow, the lines AB, CD, EF need to be extended until they meet each other. The intersections of these three lines form the triangle.\n\nFirst, let's find the intersection point of lines AB and CD.\n\nLet me set the parametric equations equal.\n\nFor AB: x = a + t(c - a), y = b + t(d - b)\n\nFor CD: x = e + s*(-a - e - e? Wait, let me correct.\n\nWait, earlier for CD:\n\nParametrization of CD: starting at C(e,f), direction vector to D is (-a - e, -b - f). So the parametric equations are:\n\nx = e + s*(-a - e)\n\nWait, no, the direction vector is (D.x - C.x, D.y - C.y) = (-a - e, -b - f). So the parametric equations can be written as:\n\nx = e + s*(-a - e)\n\nWait, that would be moving from point C towards D as s increases from 0 to 1. But to go beyond, we can have s <0 or s>1.\n\nWait, but actually, the direction vector is (-a - e, -b - f). So the parametric equation for CD is:\n\nx = e + s*(-a - e)\n\nWait, that seems incorrect. Wait, actually, the direction vector is (-a - e, -b - f), so the parametric equations should be:\n\nx = e + s*(-a - e)\n\nWait, no, that would be adding s times the direction vector. Wait, actually, the direction vector is ( -a - e, -b - f ), so the parametric equations are:\n\nx = e + s*( -a - e )\n\ny = f + s*( -b - f )\n\nWait, but actually, the direction vector is ( -a - e, -b - f ), so the parametric equations should be:\n\nx = e + s*(-a - e)\n\ny = f + s*(-b - f )\n\nYes, that's correct. So s is a parameter. When s=0, it's at point C, s=1 at point D, s negative goes beyond C, and s>1 goes beyond D.\n\nSimilarly for AB:\n\nx = a + t*(c - a)\n\ny = b + t*(d - b )\n\nSo, to find the intersection point P between AB and CD, set their coordinates equal:\n\na + t*(c - a) = e + s*(-a - e)\n\nb + t*(d - b) = f + s*(-b - f )\n\nWe need to solve for t and s.\n\nSimilarly, we can set up equations for the other intersections.\n\nThis might get complicated, but perhaps with the symmetry of the hexagon, there is a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of homothety or area ratios?\n\nAlternatively, note that in such a hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the triangle formed by the extensions of three non-adjacent sides (AB, CD, EF) is similar to the triangle formed by some other lines, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral and opposite sides are parallel, perhaps the triangle's sides can be related to the hexagon's sides through some proportionality.\n\nWait, maybe the triangle is three times the hexagon's side? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the hexagon as being formed by cutting off three corners of the triangle. Since the sides of the triangle are formed by extending the sides of the hexagon, the hexagon is inscribed within the triangle in some way. So perhaps each side of the hexagon is a segment along the sides of the triangle, but offset inward?\n\nAlternatively, the hexagon is formed by three pairs of parallel lines, each pair corresponding to a side of the triangle. Since opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel, and the triangle's sides are the lines formed by extending those hexagon sides, then each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle.\n\nWait, let me consider that.\n\nSuppose the triangle is PQR with sides of length 200, 240, 300. Let me assume that the sides PQ, QR, RP correspond to the lines extended from AB, CD, EF respectively.\n\nSince the hexagon's sides AB, CD, EF are parallel to the sides of the triangle, but offset inward.\n\nWait, perhaps the hexagon is a translation or a scaled-down version inside the triangle?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hexagon's sides are each parallel to a side of the triangle and at some distance from them, so that the hexagon is like a \"truncated\" version of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each side of the triangle is formed by two lines extended from the hexagon's sides. For example, side PQ of the triangle is formed by the extensions of AB and CD. Wait, but actually each side of the triangle is formed by the intersection of two lines extended from the hexagon's sides.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the triangle sides as being the lines that form the triangle, so each side of the triangle is an extension of one side of the hexagon. Wait, no, each side of the triangle is the intersection of two extended sides of the hexagon.\n\nWait, actually, each side of the triangle is the line segment between two intersection points. For instance, the side opposite to the intersection of AB and CD would be along the line EF extended? Hmm, perhaps this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in such a hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the distance between each pair of opposite sides is the same? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using trigonometry. Suppose the triangle has sides 200, 240, 300. Let me denote the triangle as triangle XYZ with sides of length 200, 240, 300. Let me compute its angles using the Law of Cosines.\n\nLet me suppose the triangle sides are a=200, b=240, c=300. Let me check if it's a right triangle: 200\u00b2 + 240\u00b2 = 40000 + 57600 = 97600, and 300\u00b2 is 90000. Not equal, so not a right triangle. Let me compute angles.\n\nCompute angle opposite 300 side (let's say angle Z):\n\ncos Z = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)/(2ab) = (200\u00b2 + 240\u00b2 - 300\u00b2)/(2*200*240)\n\nCalculates to (40000 + 57600 - 90000)/(96000) = (97600 - 90000)/96000 = 7600/96000 = 76/960 = 19/240 \u2248 0.0791667\n\nSo angle Z \u2248 arccos(19/240) \u2248 85.6 degrees.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hexagon's sides are each a portion of the triangle's sides minus some segments. Since the hexagon is equilateral, each side of the triangle is divided into segments by the hexagon's vertices.\n\nWait, perhaps each side of the triangle is divided into three segments by the hexagon's sides? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the hexagon as being formed by three pairs of parallel lines, each pair cutting the triangle's sides proportionally.\n\nWait, this might be getting too vague. Maybe going back to coordinates is better, even if it's tedious.\n\nLet me try to set up coordinates in a way that might simplify things.\n\nLet me assume that the triangle formed by the extensions has coordinates at convenient points. Let me set the triangle in a coordinate system where one vertex is at the origin, and sides are aligned with axes? Maybe not, but let me see.\n\nAlternatively, set the triangle such that vertex P is at (0,0), Q at (200,0), and R somewhere in the plane. Wait, but the sides are 200,240,300. Let me use the side lengths to define coordinates.\n\nLet me denote the triangle as triangle PQR with sides PQ=200, QR=240, and RP=300. Let me place point P at (0,0), point Q at (200,0). Now, need to find coordinates of R such that QR=240 and PR=300.\n\nCoordinates of R (x,y):\n\nDistance from P(0,0) to R(x,y) is 300: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 300\u00b2.\n\nDistance from Q(200,0) to R(x,y) is 240: (x - 200)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 240\u00b2.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(x - 200)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 240\u00b2 - 300\u00b2\n\nExpand (x\u00b2 -400x + 40000) - x\u00b2 = -400x + 40000 = 240\u00b2 - 300\u00b2\n\nCalculate RHS: 57600 - 90000 = -32400\n\nThus:\n\n-400x +40000 = -32400 \u2192 -400x = -72400 \u2192 x = 72400 / 400 = 181.\n\nThen x = 181. Then y\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 - 181\u00b2.\n\nCalculate 300\u00b2 = 90000, 181\u00b2 = 32761. So y\u00b2 = 90000 - 32761 = 57239. Therefore y = sqrt(57239). Hmm, approximately 239.25. Not a nice number, but okay.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nP(0,0), Q(200,0), R(181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nBut perhaps this coordinate system complicates things. Maybe better to use barycentric coordinates or another approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use vectors and the concept of the hexagon being formed by lines cutting the triangle's sides proportionally.\n\nAlternatively, note that in such a configuration, the hexagon's sides are parallel to the triangle's sides, but offset inward. Since the hexagon is equilateral, the distances from each side of the triangle to the corresponding side of the hexagon must be such that the sides of the hexagon are all equal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of similar triangles. If the hexagon's sides are parallel to the triangle's sides, then the hexagon is similar to the triangle but scaled down. Wait, but a hexagon can't be similar to a triangle. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, the three pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon are each parallel to a side of the triangle. Since the triangle has three sides, each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel to one side of the triangle. Therefore, the hexagon is inscribed within the triangle such that each pair of opposite sides is parallel to a different side of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the hexagon can be considered as a central section of the triangle, with each side parallel to a side of the triangle and offset inward by some distance.\n\nIn such a case, the side length of the hexagon can be found by considering the ratios of distances from the sides of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of homothety. If the hexagon is created by three pairs of lines parallel to the triangle's sides, then the hexagon is a homothetic figure inside the triangle.\n\nWait, in a triangle, if you draw three lines parallel to each side, offset inward by some distance, their intersections form a smaller triangle inside. But here, it's a hexagon. So maybe each side of the triangle is intersected twice by the hexagon's sides, forming six vertices.\n\nAlternatively, the hexagon has two vertices on each side of the triangle. Since each side of the triangle is intersected by two sides of the hexagon (which are parallel to the other sides of the triangle). For example, the side of the triangle opposite vertex P (which is QR) would have two vertices of the hexagon lying on it, each adjacent to sides of the hexagon parallel to the other sides of the triangle.\n\nThis might form a hexagon with two vertices on each side of the triangle, each pair of opposite sides parallel to a side of the triangle.\n\nIf this is the case, then the hexagon is called a \"trihexagon\" or something similar, but I need to think of the relations.\n\nAlternatively, if each side of the triangle has two points where the hexagon's sides meet it, then the hexagon's sides are cutting the triangle's sides proportionally.\n\nSuppose that on each side of the triangle, the two points where the hexagon touches divide the side into three segments with ratios related to the side lengths of the hexagon.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of Ceva's theorem or Menelaus' theorem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side length s of the hexagon can be found by considering that the triangle's sides are each equal to s plus twice some other length, but I need to formalize this.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the triangle as ABC with sides of length 200, 240, 300. The hexagon is inside this triangle, with each side of the hexagon parallel to a side of the triangle, and the hexagon's sides are each a distance away from the triangle's sides.\n\nWait, perhaps the distance from each side of the triangle to the corresponding sides of the hexagon is the same. Since the hexagon is equilateral, maybe the offsets are such that the reduction in each direction is proportional.\n\nAlternatively, in such a configuration, the side length of the hexagon can be calculated by the formula s = (a + b + c)/something, but I need to think of the exact relation.\n\nAlternatively, since all three pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel to the sides of the triangle, the hexagon is affine equivalent to a regular hexagon inside the triangle. But I might need to use coordinates again.\n\nWait, let me try to think of the hexagon as follows:\n\nLet the triangle have vertices P, Q, R with sides PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300.\n\nLet the hexagon have sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, each of length s.\n\nEach pair of opposite sides is parallel to a side of the triangle.\n\nSo AB and DE are parallel to QR,\n\nBC and EF are parallel to RP,\n\nCD and FA are parallel to PQ.\n\nWait, perhaps?\n\nAssuming that:\n\n- AB || DE || QR,\n\n- BC || EF || RP,\n\n- CD || FA || PQ.\n\nTherefore, each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon is inscribed in the triangle with each pair of sides parallel to a side of the triangle.\n\nThis seems plausible.\n\nIn such a case, the hexagon can be considered as a combination of three parallelograms, each aligned with a side of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral, the distances from each side of the triangle to the corresponding sides of the hexagon must be such that the lengths of the hexagon's sides are equal.\n\nLet me suppose that on each side of the triangle, the hexagon cuts the side at two points, dividing it into three segments. Let me denote the ratios of these segments.\n\nSuppose on side PQ of length 200, the hexagon's sides CD and FA (which are parallel to PQ) intersect PQ at points dividing it into segments of lengths x, s, and y, such that x + s + y = 200. But since CD and FA are parallel to PQ and part of the hexagon, the segments between the intersections would correspond to the sides of the hexagon?\n\nWait, perhaps not exactly. Alternatively, each side of the triangle is divided into three parts by the hexagon's vertices. For example, side PQ is intersected by two vertices of the hexagon, say points C and F, such that PC = a, CF = b, FQ = c, with a + b + c = 200. But I need to think more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, if each side of the triangle has two vertices of the hexagon lying on it, then each side of the triangle is divided into three segments by these two points. Let me denote the division ratios.\n\nSuppose on side PQ (length 200), the two points are D and A, dividing PQ into segments PD, DA, AQ. Wait, but need to see the order.\n\nAlternatively, let me label the triangle's vertices as P, Q, R with sides PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300.\n\nSuppose the hexagon is labeled such that vertex A is on side PR, B on side PQ, C on side QR, D on side QS (wait, no). Hmm, getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to use barycentric coordinates or area coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since all sides of the hexagon are equal and parallel to the triangle's sides, the hexagon's side length s is related to the triangle's sides via some proportion.\n\nSuppose that the hexagon is formed by lines drawn parallel to the sides of the triangle, each at a certain distance inward, such that the intersections form the hexagon. The distance from each side of the triangle to the corresponding side of the hexagon is the same in some proportional sense.\n\nLet me consider that the lines forming the hexagon are at a ratio k from each side of the triangle. For instance, if the distance from side PQ to the parallel side of the hexagon is k times the height from PQ, then the length of the hexagon's side parallel to PQ would be (1 - 2k) times PQ's length? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, using similar triangles: if a line is drawn parallel to a side of a triangle, cutting the other two sides proportionally. So, for example, if on side PQ, we have a point dividing it in the ratio t:(1 - t), then the line drawn from there parallel to the opposite side would create a smaller similar triangle.\n\nBut since the hexagon has three pairs of sides parallel to the triangle's sides, it's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the hexagon divides each side of the triangle into three equal parts? Not necessarily, but perhaps the side length s can be related via the triangle's sides through some linear combination.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote that the hexagon's sides are each a fraction of the triangle's sides.\n\nSuppose that along each side of the triangle, the hexagon's vertices divide the side into segments with ratios that can be expressed in terms of s and the triangle's side lengths.\n\nLet me consider one side of the triangle, say PQ of length 200. Suppose that on PQ, the hexagon has two vertices, say points X and Y, such that the segments PX, XY, YQ are in some proportion. Since the sides of the hexagon adjacent to PQ are parallel to other sides of the triangle.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too vague. Let me try coordinate geometry again with a specific triangle.\n\nLet me set up coordinates for triangle PQR with sides PQ=200, QR=240, RP=300. Let me place point P at (0,0), Q at (200,0), and R somewhere in the plane. Earlier, I calculated R as (181, sqrt(57239)), but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, let me compute coordinates more precisely.\n\nLet me compute coordinates of R:\n\nLet me place P at (0,0), Q at (200,0). Let R be at (x,y).\n\nDistance from P to R is 300: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 = 90000.\n\nDistance from Q to R is 240: (x - 200)^2 + y\u00b2 = 240\u00b2 = 57600.\n\nSubtracting the two equations:\n\n(x - 200)^2 + y\u00b2 - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 57600 - 90000\n\nExpanding (x\u00b2 - 400x + 40000) - x\u00b2 = -400x + 40000 = -32400\n\nHence, -400x = -32400 -40000? Wait, wait, 57600 - 90000 is -32400. So:\n\n-400x + 40000 = -32400 \u2192 -400x = -72400 \u2192 x = 72400 / 400 = 181. So x = 181.\n\nThen y\u00b2 = 90000 - (181)^2.\n\nCalculate 181 squared: 180\u00b2 = 32400, so 181\u00b2 = (180 +1)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180 +1 = 32400 + 360 +1 = 32761.\n\nThus y\u00b2 = 90000 - 32761 = 57239.\n\nSo y = sqrt(57239). Let me see if 57239 is a square? Probably not, so we can leave it as sqrt(57239). Let me note that sqrt(57239) \u2248 239.25.\n\nSo coordinates of R are (181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nNow, the hexagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, each of length s. The sides AB, CD, EF are extended to form the triangle PQR. Wait, actually, the problem states that the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, and EF. So the lines AB, CD, EF when extended meet at the vertices of the triangle PQR. So the triangle's vertices are the intersections of these lines.\n\nWait a second, this is key. The triangle is formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. So each pair of these lines (AB & CD, CD & EF, EF & AB) intersect at the triangle's vertices.\n\nTherefore, the three lines AB, CD, EF form the three sides of the triangle when extended. Wait, actually, each pair of lines intersect at a vertex. So the three lines AB, CD, EF are the three sides of the triangle.\n\nWait, actually, if you extend AB, CD, and EF, their intersections form the triangle. So each side of the triangle is the extension of one of the hexagon's sides.\n\nWait, perhaps the triangle has its three sides as the lines containing AB, CD, and EF, extended infinitely. Therefore, the triangle is the triangle formed by the three lines AB, CD, EF. Since the hexagon is convex and the lines are extended, the triangle is the triangle where each side is a line containing a side of the hexagon.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon is inscribed within this triangle, with each of its sides lying on a side of the triangle? Wait, but the sides AB, CD, EF are parts of the triangle's sides. Wait, but the problem says the hexagon is convex and the triangle is formed by extending AB, CD, EF. So the hexagon is inside the triangle, and the triangle's sides are the lines extended from the hexagon's sides AB, CD, EF.\n\nTherefore, the triangle's vertices are the intersections of these three lines (AB, CD, EF extended). So the three lines AB, CD, EF, when extended beyond the hexagon, meet at three points forming the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon is located such that its sides AB, CD, EF are parts of the triangle's sides, but only a portion of them, and the other sides of the hexagon (BC, DE, FA) are inside the triangle.\n\nGiven that, perhaps we can model this with coordinate geometry, using the triangle as the reference.\n\nLet me consider the triangle PQR with sides of length 200, 240, 300. Let me denote the lines AB, CD, EF as the three sides of the triangle. Wait, no, the lines AB, CD, EF are the sides of the triangle, but the hexagon's sides AB, CD, EF are segments along these lines, inside the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon has three sides lying along the triangle's sides, but not reaching the vertices. The other three sides (BC, DE, FA) connect these, forming the hexagon.\n\nWait, but in that case, the hexagon would have three sides on the triangle's sides and three sides inside. But the problem states it's a convex equilateral hexagon with all pairs of opposite sides parallel. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each pair of opposite sides of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle. So AB || CD || to one side of the triangle, BC || EF || to another, and so on.\n\nWait, perhaps the three pairs of opposite sides of the hexagon are each parallel to a different side of the triangle. Since the triangle has three sides, this would make sense.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon is inscribed in the triangle with each pair of opposite sides parallel to a side of the triangle.\n\nIn this configuration, the side length s of the hexagon can be determined by the distances between the parallel sides.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, the distance between each pair of opposite sides must be such that the length s is maintained.\n\nAlternatively, using the concept of similar triangles, if we consider the lines forming the hexagon as being parallel to the triangle's sides and offset inward, then the ratio of the hexagon's side to the triangle's side can be determined by the proportion of the distances.\n\nLet me denote that the hexagon divides each side of the triangle into segments. Let me suppose that along each side of the triangle, the hexagon's sides are placed at a certain fraction from the vertex.\n\nSuppose that on side PQ of length 200, the hexagon has a side CD parallel to PQ, located at some distance from P and Q. Similarly for the other sides.\n\nLet me consider that the hexagon's sides are each a fraction t of the distance from the triangle's vertices. For example, if t is the fraction along each side from the vertex where the hexagon's side is placed, then the length of the hexagon's side can be expressed in terms of t and the triangle's sides.\n\nHowever, since the hexagon is equilateral, the lengths of its sides must be equal, so the fractions along each triangle side must be chosen such that the resulting lengths are equal.\n\nAlternatively, suppose that the hexagon is such that the three pairs of opposite sides are each at a distance d from the corresponding sides of the triangle. The length of the hexagon's sides would then be proportional to the triangle's sides minus twice this distance, but scaled by the triangle's geometry.\n\nAlternatively, using area ratios. The area of the hexagon might be related to the area of the triangle, but since we need the side length, perhaps this is not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem). If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, intersecting the other two sides, then it divides those sides proportionally.\n\nSuppose on side PQ of the triangle, we have two points where the hexagon's sides meet PQ. Let me say that the side CD of the hexagon is parallel to PQ and is located somewhere inside the triangle. Then the line CD divides the other two sides QR and RP proportionally.\n\nSimilarly, the other sides of the hexagon would create similar proportional divisions on the triangle's sides.\n\nSince the hexagon is equilateral, all these proportional divisions must result in segments whose lengths correspond to the side length s.\n\nThis might be the way to go.\n\nLet me formalize this.\n\nLet me denote the triangle as PQR with sides PQ = a = 200, QR = b = 240, RP = c = 300.\n\nThe hexagon has sides AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA, each of length s.\n\nEach pair of opposite sides is parallel to a side of the triangle:\n\n- AB || DE || QR,\n\n- BC || EF || RP,\n\n- CD || FA || PQ.\n\nTherefore, the sides AB and DE are parallel to QR (of length 240),\n\nBC and EF are parallel to RP (300),\n\nCD and FA are parallel to PQ (200).\n\nNow, let me consider side AB which is parallel to QR. Since AB is part of the hexagon, it must lie somewhere inside the triangle, parallel to QR.\n\nSimilarly, side CD is parallel to PQ, so it is parallel to the side PQ of length 200.\n\nLet me consider the side AB parallel to QR. Let me denote that AB is located somewhere between P and R, cutting the sides PR and PQ.\n\nWait, actually, since AB is part of the hexagon, and the hexagon is convex, the vertices must be placed such that each side is on a different edge of the triangle.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the hexagon as follows:\n\n- Vertex A is on side PR of the triangle,\n\n- Vertex B is on side PQ,\n\n- Vertex C is on side QR,\n\n- Vertex D is on side QS (Wait, no, the triangle only has three sides: PQ, QR, RP). So vertices D must be on another side.\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nLet me define the hexagon such that:\n\n- Vertex A is on side PR,\n\n- Vertex B is on side PQ,\n\n- Vertex C is on side QR,\n\n- Vertex D is on side QR? Wait, no, need to ensure all vertices are on the triangle's edges.\n\nAlternatively, since each side of the hexagon is parallel to a side of the triangle, the vertices must lie on the triangle's sides.\n\nSpecifically, each vertex of the hexagon lies on a side of the triangle, and each side of the hexagon is parallel to a different side of the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the six vertices of the hexagon are located on the three sides of the triangle, two vertices per side.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Two vertices on side PQ,\n\n- Two vertices on side QR,\n\n- Two vertices on side RP.\n\nEach pair of vertices on a side of the triangle are connected by a side of the hexagon that is parallel to one of the other sides of the triangle.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- On side PQ (length 200), the two vertices are B and F,\n\n- On side QR (length 240), the two vertices are C and A,\n\n- On side RP (length 300), the two vertices are D and E.\n\nWait, need to ensure the sides are connected properly.\n\nAlternatively, label the vertices such that:\n\n- A is on PR,\n\n- B is on PQ,\n\n- C is on QR,\n\n- D is on RP,\n\n- E is on PQ,\n\n- F is on QR.\n\nHmm, this is getting confusing. Let me try to systematically assign vertices.\n\nLet me denote the triangle's sides:\n\nSide 1: PQ (length 200),\n\nSide 2: QR (length 240),\n\nSide 3: RP (length 300).\n\nLet the hexagon have vertices:\n\n- On side PQ: points B and F,\n\n- On side QR: points C and A,\n\n- On side RP: points D and E.\n\nThen the hexagon is A-B-C-D-E-F-A, with each side connecting these points.\n\nNow, the sides of the hexagon must be parallel to the triangle's sides:\n\n- AB is parallel to QR,\n\n- BC is parallel to RP,\n\n- CD is parallel to PQ,\n\n- DE is parallel to QR,\n\n- EF is parallel to RP,\n\n- FA is parallel to PQ.\n\nWait, this way, opposite sides are parallel:\n\nAB || DE (both parallel to QR),\n\nBC || EF (both parallel to RP),\n\nCD || FA (both parallel to PQ),\n\nwhich matches the problem's condition that all pairs of opposite sides are parallel.\n\nPerfect, this seems to work.\n\nTherefore, the hexagon is constructed by placing two vertices on each side of the triangle, with each side of the hexagon parallel to another side of the triangle.\n\nNow, with this setup, we can apply the intercept theorem (Thales' theorem) on each side of the triangle.\n\nLet me start with side PQ of length 200. On this side, we have vertices B and F.\n\nThe side AB is parallel to QR (side 2), so by intercept theorem, the segment AB divides sides PR and PQ proportionally.\n\nWait, actually, AB is part of the hexagon. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, consider side AB of the hexagon, which connects point A (on QR) to point B (on PQ). Since AB is parallel to QR (side 2), which is the side opposite to P.\n\nWait, QR is the side opposite to P, so AB is parallel to QR. Therefore, by the intercept theorem, the line AB divides sides PQ and PR proportionally.\n\nWait, more precisely, line AB connects a point B on PQ and a point A on QR, and is parallel to QR. Wait, but if AB is parallel to QR, then since QR is the side itself, this would mean that AB is parallel to QR but not overlapping. Therefore, the line AB must be cutting the other sides proportionally.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nLet me consider triangle PQR, with point B on PQ and point A on QR such that line AB is parallel to QR.\n\nWait, but QR is the side from Q to R. If AB is parallel to QR and connects B on PQ to A on QR, then this would require that point A is actually on QR extended beyond R? But since the hexagon is convex and inside the triangle, this might not be the case. Hmm, perhaps my earlier assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps AB is parallel to QR but on the other side.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to adjust the labeling.\n\nLet me try again.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- Vertex A is on side PR,\n\n- Vertex B is on side PQ,\n\n- Vertex C is on side QR,\n\n- Vertex D is on side RP,\n\n- Vertex E is on side PQ,\n\n- Vertex F is on side QR.\n\nThen the sides are:\n\nAB connects A (PR) to B (PQ),\n\nBC connects B (PQ) to C (QR),\n\nCD connects C (QR) to D (RP),\n\nDE connects D (RP) to E (PQ),\n\nEF connects E (PQ) to F (QR),\n\nFA connects F (QR) to A (PR).\n\nNow, the sides must be parallel as follows:\n\nAB || DE,\n\nBC || EF,\n\nCD || FA.\n\nAnd each of these pairs is parallel to a side of the triangle.\n\nSuppose:\n\nAB || DE || QR,\n\nBC || EF || RP,\n\nCD || FA || PQ.\n\nTherefore:\n\nAB is parallel to QR,\n\nBC is parallel to RP,\n\nCD is parallel to PQ.\n\nThis way, each pair of opposite sides is parallel to a side of the triangle.\n\nNow, applying the intercept theorem to each side.\n\nStarting with side AB parallel to QR.\n\nLine AB connects point B on PQ to point A on PR, and is parallel to QR.\n\nBy intercept theorem, the ratio of the segments on PQ and PR must be equal.\n\nSpecifically, in triangle PQR, line AB is parallel to QR, so:\n\nPB / BQ = PA / AR.\n\nWait, let me define variables.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nOn side PQ (length 200), let the distance from P to B be x, so PB = x, BQ = 200 - x.\n\nOn side PR (length 300), let the distance from P to A be y, so PA = y, AR = 300 - y.\n\nSince AB is parallel to QR, by the intercept theorem:\n\nPB / BQ = PA / AR \u21d2 x / (200 - x) = y / (300 - y). \u2192 Equation 1.\n\nSimilarly, side BC is parallel to RP (side 3). Let's see.\n\nSide BC connects point B (on PQ) to point C (on QR). Since BC is parallel to RP.\n\nWait, RP is the side from R to P. So direction from R to P.\n\nTherefore, line BC is parallel to RP.\n\nApplying intercept theorem to triangle PQR with line BC parallel to RP.\n\nThe line BC connects point B on PQ to point C on QR, and is parallel to RP.\n\nTherefore, the ratio along PQ and QR must be the same.\n\nLet me define:\n\nOn side QR (length 240), let the distance from Q to C be z, so QC = z, CR = 240 - z.\n\nOn side PQ (length 200), we have PB = x, so the ratio would be QB / BP = (200 - x)/x.\n\nWait, intercept theorem states that if a line parallel to one side cuts the other two sides, then the segments are proportional.\n\nIn this case, line BC is parallel to RP (which is from R to P). So in triangle PQR, the line BC connects B on PQ to C on QR, and is parallel to RP.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of QB / BP = QC / CR ?\n\nWait, let me think carefully.\n\nAlternatively, in triangle PQR, the line BC is parallel to side RP. So the line BC cuts sides PQ and QR.\n\nTherefore, by intercept theorem:\n\nQB / QP = QC / QR ?\n\nWait, intercept theorem says that if a line parallel to one side of the triangle intersects the other two sides, then it divides them proportionally.\n\nTherefore, for line BC parallel to RP (which is side PR?), wait RP is side PR? Wait RP is from R to P, which is side PR of length 300.\n\nWait, the line BC is parallel to RP (side PR). So in triangle PQR, line BC is parallel to side PR, which is opposite vertex Q.\n\nTherefore, applying intercept theorem to triangle PQR with line BC parallel to side PR:\n\nThe line BC intersects sides PQ and QR at points B and C respectively.\n\nTherefore, the theorem states that:\n\nQB / QP = QC / QR.\n\nWait, QP is the entire length from Q to P, which is PQ = 200.\n\nQC is the segment from Q to C on QR, which is z,\n\nQR is the entire side QR = 240.\n\nSo:\n\nQB / QP = QC / QR \u21d2 (QB) / 200 = z / 240.\n\nBut QB is the length from Q to B on PQ. Since PQ is from P to Q, QB = PQ - PB = 200 - x.\n\nThus:\n\n(200 - x)/200 = z / 240 \u2192 Equation 2.\n\nSimilarly, for the line CD parallel to PQ.\n\nCD connects point C (on QR) to point D (on RP), and is parallel to PQ.\n\nApplying intercept theorem to triangle PQR with line CD parallel to PQ.\n\nLine CD is parallel to PQ (side PQ), so it will cut sides QR and RP.\n\nWait, CD connects C on QR to D on RP, so it's cutting QR and RP.\n\nTherefore, by intercept theorem:\n\nQC / QR = QD / QP ?\n\nWait, let me think again.\n\nIn triangle PQR, line CD is parallel to PQ, so it must cut sides QR and PR (since PQ is between P and Q).\n\nWait, QR is between Q and R, and PR is between P and R.\n\nWait, line CD goes from C on QR to D on RP.\n\nTherefore, the intercept theorem would relate the segments on QR and RP.\n\nSpecifically:\n\nQC / QR = QD / QP ?\n\nWait, perhaps:\n\nThe line CD parallel to PQ cuts QR at C and PR at D.\n\nTherefore, the ratio QC / QR = QD / QP.\n\nWait, QP is the length from Q to P, which is PQ = 200,\n\nQR is 240,\n\nQC is z,\n\nQD is the length from Q to D along PR? Wait, PR is from P to R, so Q is not on PR. Hmm, perhaps this is getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, since CD is parallel to PQ, and PQ is the side opposite R, the intercept theorem would state that QC / CR = QD / DR ?\n\nWait, maybe better to consider triangle QPR?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to use coordinates again.\n\nLet me proceed with coordinates for triangle PQR as before:\n\nP(0, 0),\n\nQ(200, 0),\n\nR(181, sqrt(57239)) \u2248 (181, 239.25).\n\nLet me denote the coordinates more precisely.\n\nLet me denote R as (x_R, y_R) = (181, sqrt(57239)).\n\nNow, let me assign parameters to the points on the sides.\n\nLet me parameterize the positions of the hexagon's vertices on the triangle's sides.\n\nLet me define:\n\nOn side PQ (from P(0,0) to Q(200,0)):\n\n- Point B is at a distance of x from P: coordinates (x, 0).\n\n- Point E is another point on PQ, but since we have two vertices on PQ, B and F? Wait, earlier labeling had two points on each side.\n\nWait, according to the earlier labeling:\n\nOn side PQ, we have vertices B and E (since DE is parallel to QR, so D is on RP and E on PQ).\n\nWait, this is getting too tangled. Maybe better to use parameters for each vertex.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nOn side PQ (from P to Q):\n\n- Let point B divide PQ in the ratio t:1-t, so coordinates B = (200*t, 0), where 0 < t < 1.\n\n- Similarly, another point E on PQ, say at 200*s, 0, where s is another parameter.\n\nOn side QR (from Q(200,0) to R(181, y_R)):\n\n- Point C divides QR. Let me parameterize QR. Let me compute the parametric equations for QR.\n\nQR goes from Q(200,0) to R(181, y_R). The vector from Q to R is (-19, y_R). So a point C on QR can be expressed as Q + k*(vector QR):\n\nC_x = 200 - 19*k,\n\nC_y = 0 + y_R*k,\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 k \u2264 1.\n\nSimilarly, another point F on QR can be at another parameter, say m.\n\nOn side RP (from R to P(0,0)):\n\n- Point D divides RP. RP goes from R(181, y_R) to P(0,0). The vector is (-181, -y_R). A point D can be expressed as R + n*(vector RP):\n\nD_x = 181 - 181*n,\n\nD_y = y_R - y_R*n,\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 n \u22641.\n\n- Point A is another point on RP, say at parameter p.\n\nNow, the hexagon is A-B-C-D-E-F-A.\n\nNow, the sides must be parallel as per the conditions:\n\nAB || DE || QR,\n\nBC || EF || RP,\n\nCD || FA || PQ.\n\nThis requires setting up equations based on the slopes.\n\nFirst, compute the slope of QR:\n\nQR goes from Q(200,0) to R(181, y_R). The slope is (y_R - 0)/(181 - 200) = y_R / (-19).\n\nSimilarly, slope of PQ is 0 (horizontal line).\n\nSlope of RP: from R(181,y_R) to P(0,0): slope is (-y_R)/181.\n\nNow, for AB to be parallel to QR:\n\nThe slope of AB must equal slope of QR.\n\nCoordinates of A and B:\n\nPoint A is on RP, let's say at parameter p: A = (181*(1 - p), y_R*(1 - p)).\n\nPoint B is on PQ at (200*t, 0).\n\nSlope of AB: [0 - y_R*(1 - p)] / [200*t - 181*(1 - p)] = - y_R*(1 - p) / [200t - 181 + 181p].\n\nThis must equal slope of QR: y_R / (-19).\n\nTherefore:\n\n[ - y_R*(1 - p) ] / [200t - 181 + 181p ] = y_R / (-19)\n\nCancel y_R (assuming y_R \u22600, which it is):\n\n- (1 - p) / [200t - 181 + 181p ] = 1 / (-19)\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n- (1 - p)*(-19) = 200t - 181 + 181p\n\n19(1 - p) = 200t - 181 + 181p\n\n19 - 19p = 200t - 181 + 181p\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n19 -19p -200t + 181 -181p =0\n\n(19 + 181) + (-19p -181p) -200t =0\n\n200 - 200p -200t =0\n\nDivide both sides by 200:\n\n1 - p - t =0 \u2192 p + t =1 \u2192 p =1 - t. Equation (1).\n\nNext, consider side BC parallel to RP.\n\nPoint B is at (200t,0),\n\nPoint C is on QR at parameter k: C_x=200 -19k, C_y= y_R k.\n\nSlope of BC must equal slope of RP, which is -y_R / 181.\n\nSlope of BC: (y_R k -0)/(200 -19k -200t) = y_R k / (200(1 - t) -19k)\n\nSet equal to -y_R /181:\n\ny_R k / [200(1 - t) -19k] = - y_R /181\n\nCancel y_R:\n\nk / [200(1 - t) -19k] = -1/181\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nk = - [200(1 - t) -19k]/181\n\nMultiply both sides by 181:\n\n181k = -200(1 - t) +19k\n\nBring terms with k to left:\n\n181k -19k = -200(1 - t)\n\n162k = -200 +200t\n\n\u2192 162k =200(t -1) \u2192 Equation (2).\n\nNext, side CD is parallel to PQ (slope 0).\n\nPoint C is at (200 -19k, y_R k),\n\nPoint D is on RP at parameter n: D_x=181(1 -n), D_y= y_R(1 -n).\n\nSlope of CD must be 0, so the y-coordinate difference must be 0:\n\nD_y - C_y =0 \u2192 y_R(1 -n) - y_R k =0 \u2192 y_R [1 -n -k ]=0 \u2192 1 -n -k =0 \u2192 n =1 -k. Equation (3).\n\nNext, side DE is parallel to QR (same slope as QR).\n\nPoint D is (181(1 -n), y_R(1 -n)),\n\nPoint E is on PQ at (200s, 0).\n\nSlope of DE must equal slope of QR: y_R / (-19).\n\nSlope of DE: [0 - y_R(1 -n)] / [200s -181(1 -n)] = - y_R(1 -n)/[200s -181 +181n]\n\nSet equal to y_R / (-19):\n\n- y_R(1 -n)/[200s -181 +181n] = y_R / (-19)\n\nCancel y_R:\n\n- (1 -n)/[200s -181 +181n] = 1/(-19)\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\n- (1 -n)*(-19) = 200s -181 +181n\n\n19(1 -n) =200s -181 +181n\n\n19 -19n =200s -181 +181n\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n19 -19n -200s +181 -181n=0\n\n(19 +181) + (-19n -181n) -200s =0\n\n200 -200n -200s =0 \u2192 1 -n -s =0 \u2192 n +s=1 \u2192 s=1 -n. Equation (4).\n\nNext, side EF is parallel to RP (slope -y_R/181).\n\nPoint E is at (200s,0),\n\nPoint F is on QR at parameter m: F_x=200 -19m, F_y= y_R m.\n\nSlope of EF must equal slope of RP: -y_R /181.\n\nSlope of EF: (y_R m -0)/(200 -19m -200s) = y_R m / [200(1 -s) -19m]\n\nSet equal to -y_R /181:\n\ny_R m / [200(1 -s) -19m] = - y_R /181\n\nCancel y_R:\n\nm / [200(1 -s) -19m] = -1/181\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nm = - [200(1 -s) -19m]/181\n\nMultiply both sides by 181:\n\n181m = -200(1 -s) +19m\n\nBring terms with m to left:\n\n181m -19m = -200 +200s\n\n162m =200(s -1) \u2192 Equation (5).\n\nFinally, side FA parallel to PQ (slope 0).\n\nPoint F is at (200 -19m, y_R m),\n\nPoint A is on RP at parameter p=1 -t (from Equation 1): A_x=181*(1 - (1 -t)) =181 t,\n\nA_y= y_R*(1 - (1 -t)) = y_R t.\n\nSlope of FA must be 0, so the y-coordinate difference is 0:\n\nA_y - F_y =0 \u2192 y_R t - y_R m =0 \u2192 y_R (t -m)=0 \u2192 t = m. Equation (6).\n\nNow, we have equations (1) to (6):\n\n1. p =1 -t\n\n2. 162k =200(t -1)\n\n3. n =1 -k\n\n4. s =1 -n\n\n5. 162m =200(s -1)\n\n6. t =m\n\nLet me substitute equations step by step.\n\nFrom equation 6: t =m.\n\nFrom equation 4: s =1 -n,\n\nFrom equation 3: n=1 -k \u2192 s =1 - (1 -k)=k,\n\nThus s =k.\n\nFrom equation 2: 162k =200(t -1),\n\nBut t =m, and s =k,\n\nThus 162k =200(m -1),\n\nBut since m =t,\n\n162k =200(t -1),\n\nBut s=k,\n\nSo 162s =200(t -1). Equation A.\n\nFrom equation 5: 162m =200(s -1),\n\nBut m =t,\n\ns =k,\n\nThus 162t =200(s -1). Equation B.\n\nNow, we have two equations:\n\nEquation A: 162s =200(t -1)\n\nEquation B: 162t =200(s -1)\n\nWe can solve these two equations for s and t.\n\nLet me write them:\n\n162s -200t = -200 \u2192 Equation A,\n\n-200s +162t = -200 \u2192 Equation B.\n\nLet me write this system:\n\n162s -200t = -200,\n\n-200s +162t = -200.\n\nLet me solve this system.\n\nMultiply the first equation by 200 and the second by 162 to eliminate s:\n\nFirst equation *200: 32400s -40000t = -40000,\n\nSecond equation *162: -32400s +26124t = -32400.\n\nNow add both equations:\n\n(32400s -32400s) + (-40000t +26124t) = -40000 -32400,\n\n-13876t = -72400,\n\nThus t = (-72400)/(-13876) = 72400/13876.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 4:\n\n72400 \u00f74 =18100,\n\n13876 \u00f74 =3469.\n\nWait, 13876 divided by 4 is 3469? Let me check:\n\n4*3469 = 13876. Yes.\n\nSo t=18100/3469.\n\nWait, can this be simplified further?\n\nCheck if 18100 and 3469 have common factors.\n\n3469: let's see, 3469 divided by 7: 7*495=3465, remainder 4. Not divisible by 7.\n\nDivided by 13: 13*266=3458, remainder 11. Not divisible by 13.\n\n17: 17*204=3468, remainder 1. Not divisible by 17.\n\nMaybe it's prime? Not sure. Let's keep it as 18100/3469.\n\nSimilarly, compute s from equation A:\n\n162s =200(t -1),\n\nt =18100/3469,\n\nSo t -1 = (18100 -3469)/3469 =14631/3469,\n\nThus,\n\n162s =200*(14631)/3469,\n\ns = (200 *14631)/(162*3469).\n\nSimplify:\n\n200/162 = 100/81,\n\nThus,\n\ns = (100/81)*(14631)/3469.\n\nCalculate 14631 divided by 3469:\n\nLet me see 3469 *4 =13876,\n\n14631 -13876 =755,\n\nSo 14631/3469 =4 + 755/3469.\n\nHmm, messy. Perhaps we can compute the numerical value:\n\nFirst compute t:\n\nt =72400/13876 \u224872400 \u00f713876 \u22485.216.\n\nWait, but t was defined as a parameter along PQ from P, so t should be between 0 and1, since it's a point on PQ. Wait a second, this suggests t\u22485.2, which is outside the segment PQ (which has length 200). That can't be. There must be a mistake in the equations.\n\nOh no, this inconsistency indicates an error in my setup.\n\nLet me check the equations again.\n\nWait, in equation 2: I had:\n\n162k =200(t -1).\n\nBut if k is a parameter along QR from Q to R (from 0 to1), then if t is greater than 1, that would imply k is positive. But t is a parameter along PQ from P to Q, so t should be between 0 and1. Hence getting t\u22485.2 is impossible. So I must have made an error in setting up the equations.\n\nLet me backtrack.\n\nStarting with equation 2:\n\nWhen I set up the slope for BC parallel to RP, I might have messed up the direction.\n\nLet me re-examine the slope calculation for BC.\n\nPoint B is at (200t,0),\n\nPoint C is on QR parameterized as (200 -19k, y_R k).\n\nSlope of BC is [y_R k -0]/[ (200 -19k) -200t ] = y_R k / (200(1 - t) -19k).\n\nThis slope must be equal to the slope of RP, which is from R to P: slope is (0 - y_R)/(0 -181) = (-y_R)/(-181) = y_R /181.\n\nWait, hold on! Earlier I thought the slope of RP was -y_R/181, but actually:\n\nRP goes from R(181,y_R) to P(0,0). So the slope is (0 - y_R)/(0 -181) = (-y_R)/(-181) = y_R /181.\n\nSo the slope of RP is positive y_R/181, not negative.\n\nPreviously, I had written slope of RP as -y_R/181, which was incorrect. That's where the mistake was.\n\nTherefore, in equation for BC parallel to RP:\n\nThe slope of BC should equal slope of RP: y_R /181.\n\nThus, the equation should be:\n\ny_R k / (200(1 - t) -19k) = y_R /181.\n\nCanceling y_R,\n\nk / (200(1 - t) -19k) = 1/181.\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n181k = 200(1 - t) -19k\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n181k +19k -200(1 -t)=0\n\n200k -200 +200t =0\n\n200(k + t -1)=0 \u2192 k + t -1 =0 \u2192 k =1 - t. Equation (2 corrected).\n\nPreviously I had equation 2 as 162k =200(t-1), which was wrong because of incorrect slope sign.\n\nThis is a crucial mistake. Let me redo the equations with corrected slope.\n\nLet me re-derive all equations with the correct slope for RP.\n\nStarting over:\n\nSlope of RP is y_R /181.\n\nEquation for BC parallel to RP:\n\nSlope of BC = slope of RP:\n\n[y_R k -0]/[ (200 -19k) -200t ] = y_R /181.\n\nSimplify:\n\n(y_R k) / (200(1 - t) -19k) = y_R /181\n\nCancel y_R:\n\nk / (200(1 -t) -19k) = 1/181\n\nCross multiply:\n\n181k = 200(1 -t) -19k\n\n181k +19k = 200(1 -t)\n\n200k =200(1 -t)\n\nDivide both sides by 200:\n\nk =1 -t \u2192 Equation 2.\n\nGreat, this is much simpler.\n\nContinuing with the other equations.\n\nEquation for CD parallel to PQ (slope 0):\n\nPoint C is (200 -19k, y_R k),\n\nPoint D is on RP parameter n: (181(1 -n), y_R(1 -n)).\n\nSlope CD must be 0:\n\n[ y_R(1 -n) - y_R k ] / [181(1 -n) - (200 -19k) ] =0\n\nNumerator must be zero:\n\ny_R(1 -n -k)=0 \u2192 1 -n -k =0 \u2192 n=1 -k.

Since k=1-t,\n\nC_x =200 -19(1 -t)=200 -19 +19t=181 +19t,\n\nC_y =y_R (1 -t).\n\nDistance BC:\n\nsqrt[(181 +19t -200t)^2 + (y_R(1 -t) -0)^2]\n\n= sqrt[(181 -181t)^2 + (y_R (1 -t))\u00b2]\n\n= (1 -t)*sqrt(181\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2).\n\nThis must also equal s.\n\nThus, we have two expressions for s:\n\nFrom AB: s = t*sqrt(19\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2),\n\nFrom BC: s = (1 -t)*sqrt(181\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2).\n\nSet them equal:\n\nt*sqrt(361 + y_R\u00b2) = (1 -t)*sqrt(181\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2).\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:\n\nt\u00b2(361 + y_R\u00b2) = (1 -t)^2(181\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2).\n\nExpand the right side:\n\n(1 -2t +t\u00b2)(181\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2).\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt\u00b2(361 + y_R\u00b2) - (1 -2t +t\u00b2)(181\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2) =0.\n\nFactor:\n\nLet me denote Y = y_R\u00b2 for simplicity.\n\nThen,\n\nt\u00b2(361 + Y) - (1 -2t +t\u00b2)(181\u00b2 + Y) =0.\n\nExpand the second term:\n\n= - (181\u00b2 + Y) + 2t(181\u00b2 + Y) - t\u00b2(181\u00b2 + Y)\n\nThus,\n\nt\u00b2(361 + Y) - (181\u00b2 + Y) + 2t(181\u00b2 + Y) - t\u00b2(181\u00b2 + Y) =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nt\u00b2[ (361 + Y) - (181\u00b2 + Y) ] + 2t(181\u00b2 + Y) - (181\u00b2 + Y) =0\n\nSimplify the t\u00b2 coefficient:\n\n361 + Y -181\u00b2 - Y =361 -181\u00b2 = 361 -32761 = -32400.\n\nSo:\n\n-32400 t\u00b2 + 2t(181\u00b2 + Y) - (181\u00b2 + Y) =0.\n\nLet me factor out (181\u00b2 + Y) from the last two terms:\n\n-32400 t\u00b2 + (181\u00b2 + Y)(2t -1) =0.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\n(181\u00b2 + Y)(2t -1) =32400 t\u00b2.\n\nNow, recall that y_R\u00b2 = 300\u00b2 -181\u00b2 from earlier (since point R is at (181,y_R) and PR is length 300).\n\nWait, yes! From the coordinates of R:\n\nPR is from (0,0) to (181,y_R), length 300:\n\n181\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2 =300\u00b2 \u2192 y_R\u00b2 =300\u00b2 -181\u00b2 = 90000 -32761=57239.\n\nThus, Y = y_R\u00b2=57239.\n\nPlug that into the equation:\n\n(181\u00b2 +57239)(2t -1) =32400 t\u00b2.\n\nCompute 181\u00b2 +57239:\n\n181\u00b2 is 32761,\n\n32761 +57239=90000.\n\nSo:\n\n90000*(2t -1) =32400 t\u00b2,\n\nDivide both sides by 3600:\n\n25*(2t -1)=9 t\u00b2,\n\nExpand:\n\n50t -25 =9t\u00b2,\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\n9t\u00b2 -50t +25 =0.\n\nSolve quadratic equation:\n\nt = [50 \u00b1 sqrt(2500 - 900)] /18\n\n= [50 \u00b1 sqrt(1600)] /18\n\n= [50 \u00b140]/18.\n\nThus,\n\nt=(50+40)/18=90/18=5,\n\nor t=(50-40)/18=10/18=5/9\u22480.5555.\n\nBut t must be between 0 and1, so t=5 is invalid. Thus, t=5/9.\n\nTherefore, t=5/9.\n\nNow compute s:\n\nFrom AB's length expression:\n\ns = t*sqrt(19\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2)= (5/9)*sqrt(361 +57239).\n\nCompute inside sqrt:\n\n361 +57239 =57600,\n\nsqrt(57600)=240.\n\nThus,\n\ns=(5/9)*240= (5*240)/9=1200/9=400/3\u2248133.333...\n\nWait, 1200 divided by 9 is 133.333..., but 400/3 is approximately 133.333.\n\nBut let me verify with BC's expression:\n\ns=(1 -t)*sqrt(181\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2)= (1 -5/9)*sqrt(32761 +57239).\n\n1 -5/9=4/9,\n\nsqrt(90000)=300,\n\nThus,\n\ns= (4/9)*300=1200/9=400/3\u2248133.333, same result.\n\nThus, the side length s is 400/3.\n\nBut the problem states the triangle has sides 200,240,300. The side length of the hexagon is 400/3 which is approximately 133.333.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the side lengths 200,240, and 300\". So 400/3 is about 133.33, which is less than 200, which makes sense as the hexagon is inside the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 400/3. But let me check if it's an integer. 400 divided by 3 is not an integer, but the problem says \"put your final answer within \\boxed{}\", and often such problems have integer answers. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, let me recheck calculations.\n\nWe had the quadratic equation:\n\n9t\u00b2 -50t +25 =0,\n\nSolution t=(50\u00b140)/18,\n\nt= (50-40)/18=10/18=5/9,\n\nCorrect.\n\nThen s= t*sqrt(19\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2).\n\n19\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2 =19\u00b2 + (300\u00b2 -181\u00b2).\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nWait, y_R squared is 57239, and 19\u00b2=361, so 361+57239=57600, sqrt(57600)=240. Correct.\n\nThus s= (5/9)*240= (5*240)/9=1200/9=400/3\u2248133.333.\n\nHmm, 400/3 is the exact value. Maybe the problem expects this fraction, but let me check if the problem allows fractional answers. The problem says \"Find the side length of the hexagon\" and the last line says \"Put your final answer within \\boxed{}\". Since 400/3 is an exact value, but maybe there's a miscalculation?\n\nWait, let me verify the key step where I computed y_R squared:\n\nEarlier, we had for point R:\n\nx_R=181,\n\ny_R squared=300\u00b2 -181\u00b2=90000 - (180+1)^2=90000 - (32400 +360 +1)=90000-32761=57239,\n\nWhich is correct.\n\nThen 19\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2=361 +57239=57600,\n\nsqrt(57600)=240,\n\nYes.\n\nThus s=5/9 *240= 400/3.\n\nHmm, maybe the problem expects an integer, so perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the setup.\n\nWait, the problem says \"convex equilateral hexagon in which all pairs of opposite sides are parallel\". I assumed that opposite sides are parallel to the triangle's sides, but maybe the correspondence is different?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my coordinate assignment led to an incorrect relation.\n\nWait, the problem says the triangle formed by extending AB, CD, EF has sides 200,240,300. In my setup, the triangle is exactly the triangle PQR with sides 200,240,300, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the calculations are correct, leading to s=400/3.\n\nWait, but maybe I misapplied the intercept theorem. Let me think differently.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different approach leading to an integer.\n\nWait, 400/3 is approximately 133.33, but maybe the problem expects an integer. Alternatively, perhaps my mistake was in the direction of vectors or in the intercept theorem.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the triangle sides as the big triangle, and the hexagon's side s is related via 1/s = 1/200 +1/240 +1/300 or something, but that seems random.\n\nAlternatively, the side length s is the harmonic mean or something else.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the reciprocal:\n\nIf the three sides of the triangle are 200,240,300, then their harmonic mean is 3/(1/200 +1/240 +1/300). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon is equilateral and each side is parallel to a side of the triangle, the side length s is given by s = (a*b*c)/(a*b + b*c + c*a) or some formula. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of homothety. The hexagon is a homothetic figure inside the triangle. The ratio of homothety would be such that the sides are scaled down by a factor.\n\nSuppose the homothety center is at one of the triangle's vertices.\n\nAlternatively, given that the hexagon has sides parallel to the triangle's sides, the ratio of similarity can be determined by the intercept theorem.\n\nFrom earlier, we found s =400/3\u2248133.33.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might require an integer answer, so maybe I made a mistake in the coordinate system.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the triangle's sides are the extensions of AB, CD, and EF. In my setup, the triangle is exactly the triangle formed by those lines, so the triangle's sides are exactly the lines containing AB, CD, EF. Hence, the triangle's side lengths are the lengths between those lines.\n\nWait, but in my calculation, the triangle has sides 200,240,300, which matches the problem's statement, so that is correct.\n\nThus, perhaps the answer is indeed 400/3, which is approximately 133.333. Since the problem says \"integer answer\", but 400/3 is not integer, perhaps I made an error in the problem interpretation.\n\nWait, let me re-express the equations.\n\nWait, when I computed the length AB:\n\nAB is between points A(181t, y_R t) and B(200t,0).\n\nThe difference in x-coordinates is 200t -181t =19t,\n\nDifference in y-coordinates is -y_R t,\n\nThus distance squared is (19t)^2 + (y_R t)^2 = t\u00b2(19\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2),\n\nso distance is t*sqrt(19\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2).\n\nSimilarly for BC.\n\nWait, but 19 comes from the QR side's run from Q to R: the x-coordinate difference was 181-200= -19.\n\nWait, but in coordinates, QR is from Q(200,0) to R(181,y_R), so the run is 181-200= -19, rise is y_R.\n\nThus, the length of QR is sqrt( (-19)^2 + y_R^2 ) = sqrt(361 + y_R\u00b2).\n\nWait, but QR is given as 240. Thus,\n\nsqrt(361 + y_R\u00b2)=240,\n\nSo 361 + y_R\u00b2=240\u00b2=57600,\n\nThus y_R\u00b2=57600-361=57239,\n\nWhich matches our previous calculation.\n\nThus, AB's length is t*sqrt( QR\u00b2 ), since QR is 240,\n\nWait, sqrt(361 + y_R\u00b2)=240,\n\nTherefore, AB's length is t*240,\n\nSimilarly, BC's length is (1 -t)*sqrt( (181)^2 + y_R\u00b2 ).\n\nWait, the term inside sqrt for BC was 181\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2,\n\nBut PR is length 300, so sqrt(181\u00b2 + y_R\u00b2)=300,\n\nThus BC's length is (1 -t)*300.\n\nThus, setting AB = BC,\n\n240t =300(1 -t),\n\n240t +300t =300,\n\n540t=300,\n\nt=300/540=5/9,\n\nThus s=240*(5/9)=1200/9=400/3.\n\nThus the calculations are correct. Therefore, the answer is 400/3.\n\nBut the problem asks for an integer in a box. Maybe the problem is in units or I misread the side lengths.\n\nWait, the problem says the triangle formed by the extensions has side lengths 200,240,300. In my setup, that triangle is exactly the triangle PQR with sides 200,240,300. Thus the calculations are correct, and the hexagon's side is 400/3. So unless there's a miscalculation, that must be the answer.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem states the triangle has sides 200,240,300, but in my coordinate system, the side PQ is 200, QR is 240, PR is 300. Thus the triangle is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question wants the answer as a fraction, so 400/3 is correct. The problem didn't specify it has to be integer. Let me check the problem again:\n\n\"Find the side length of the hexagon. Put your final answer within \\boxed{}.\"\n\nIt just says integer? Wait, the user instruction says \"Answer the following math problem. The last line of your response should be your integer answer within \\boxed{}.\" Wait, the user says \"integer answer\".\n\nHmm, that complicates things. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming the correspondence of the sides.\n\nWait, perhaps my assumption that AB is parallel to QR is incorrect. Maybe AB is parallel to a different side.\n\nIn the problem, it says \"the triangle whose sides are extensions of segments AB, CD, and EF\".\n\nIn my setup, the triangle sides are the lines containing AB, CD, EF. So the triangle's sides are those three lines. The lengths of the triangle are the distances between those lines.\n\nWait, but in my coordinate system, the triangle's sides are the actual sides of triangle PQR, which have lengths 200,240,300. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the side of the triangle opposite to the intersection of AB and CD is not QR but another side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe my correspondence of which sides are parallel is incorrect.\n\nSuppose instead that:\n\n- AB || CD || to one side,\n\n- BC || DE || to another,\n\n- FA || EF || to the third.\n\nBut this would require a different assignment.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps AB is parallel to side PQ instead of QR.\n\nLet me try redefining the parallel sides differently.\n\nSuppose:\n\n- AB || CD || PQ,\n\n- BC || EF || QR,\n\n- FA || DE || RP.\n\nThis might change the equations.\n\nLet me try this.\n\nAssume:\n\nAB parallel to PQ,\n\nBC parallel to QR,\n\nCD parallel to RP,\n\nDE parallel to PQ,\n\nEF parallel to QR,\n\nFA parallel to RP.\n\nThis way, each pair of opposite sides is parallel to a side of the triangle.\n\nThen the equations would change accordingly.\n\nFollowing this, let's recompute.\n\nLet me reassign the parallelism:\n\nAB || DE || PQ,\n\nBC || EF || QR,\n\nCD || FA || RP.\n\nThis is a different assignment.\n\nFollowing this:\n\nAB is parallel to PQ (slope 0),\n\nBC is parallel to QR (slope y_R / (-19),\n\nCD is parallel to RP (slope y_R /181).\n\nLet me redo the equations with this new correspondence.\n\nLet me proceed similarly:\n\nDefine variables:\n\nOn PQ: points B and E,\n\nOn QR: points C and A,\n\nOn RP: points D and F.\n\nHexagon vertices: A,B,C,D,E,F.\n\nAB connects A (on RP) to B (on PQ), parallel to PQ.\n\nBC connects B to C (on QR), parallel to QR,\n\nCD connects C to D (on RP), parallel to RP,\n\nDE connects D to E (on PQ), parallel to PQ,\n\nEF connects E to F (on QR), parallel to QR,\n\nFA connects F to A, parallel to RP.\n\nWait, this seems inconsistent, but let's proceed.\n\nLet me re-define the coordinates accordingly.\n\nPoint A is on RP,\n\nPoint B is on PQ,\n\nPoint C is on QR,\n\nPoint D is on RP,\n\nPoint E is on PQ,\n\nPoint F is on QR.\n\nHexagon: A-B-C-D-E-F-A.\n\nAB || PQ \u21d2 slope 0,\n\nBC || QR \u21d2 slope y_R / (-19),\n\nCD || RP \u21d2 slope y_R /181,\n\nDE || PQ \u21d2 slope 0,\n\nEF || QR \u21d2 slope y_R / (-19),\n\nFA || RP \u21d2 slope y_R /181.\n\nNow, applying intercept theorem.\n\nStarting with AB parallel to PQ (slope 0):\n\nAB is from A to B, parallel to PQ (horizontal line).\n\nThus, point A must have the same y-coordinate as point B.\n\nSince B is on PQ (y=0), so A must also be at y=0. But A is on RP which goes from R(181,y_R) to P(0,0). The only point on RP with y=0 is P itself. But P is a vertex of the triangle, and the hexagon is convex, so A cannot be P. Thus this configuration is impossible. Therefore, this parallel assignment is invalid.\n\nHence my initial correspondence was correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct side length is 400/3. Since the problem might expect a fraction, but the user specifies an integer, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, maybe I miscalculated the quadratic equation.\n\nThe quadratic equation was:\n\n9t\u00b2 -50t +25 =0,\n\nSolutions:\n\nt = [50 \u00b1\u221a(2500 - 900)]/18,\n\n\u221a(1600)=40,\n\nThus,\n\nt=(50\u00b140)/18,\n\nt=90/18=5 or 10/18=5/9.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nThus, s=400/3\u2248133.333. Since the problem says \"convex equilateral hexagon\", it's possible the answer is 120, but I don't see how.\n\nWait, let me see 400/3 is approximately 133.333. Maybe the problem wants it as a fraction, boxed as \\boxed{\\dfrac{400}{3}}. But the user instruction says \"integer answer\". Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the problem's interpretation.\n\nWait, the problem says the triangle formed by the extensions of AB, CD, and EF has side lengths 200,240,300. In my setup, the triangle is PQR with those lengths. The hexagon is inside it, so the side length s must be smaller than all sides of the triangle. 400/3\u2248133.33 is less than 200, so that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might have a different configuration where s is 120. Let me think of another approach.\n\nSuppose the hexagon is such that each side is a third of the triangle's sides. But 200/3\u224866.66, which is too small.\n\nAlternatively, using the property of the equilateral hexagon with opposite sides parallel, the side length can be found by the formula s = (a + b + c)/something.\n\nAlternatively, the triangle has area, and the hexagon's area is related, but that might not help.\n\nAlternatively, using vectors:\n\nLet me consider the hexagon's vertices as points along the triangle's sides.\n\nLet me suppose that on each side of the triangle, the hexagon's two vertices divide the side into three equal parts. Then the side length s would be proportional.\n\nFor instance, on side PQ of length 200, dividing it into three parts gives segments of 200/3 each. The side of the hexagon parallel to QR would then have length scaled by the ratio of the distance from the side.\n\nBut without precise calculation, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider mass point or area ratios.\n\nThe area of triangle PQR can be computed using Heron's formula.\n\nSides a=200, b=240, c=300.\n\ns = (200+240+300)/2=370.\n\nArea = sqrt(370*(370-200)*(370-240)*(370-300)),\n\n= sqrt(370*170*230*70).\n\nThis is messy, but perhaps the ratio of areas can help.\n\nThe hexagon's area would be Area_triangle - areas of three corner triangles.\n\nBut since the hexagon is equilateral, the areas might relate to s\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the side length is 120.\n\nWait, 400/3 is approximately 133.33, but if I miscalculated the quadratic solution.\n\nWait, let me recompute the quadratic equation:\n\nFrom the equation:\n\n9t\u00b2 -50t +25 =0,\n\nDiscriminant: 50\u00b2 -4*9*25=2500-900=1600,\n\nsqrt(1600)=40,\n\nThus,\n\nt=(50\u00b140)/18,\n\nt=50+40=90 \u219290/18=5,\n\nt=50-40=10\u219210/18=5/9,\n\nYes, so correct.\n\nHmm, I think the answer is 400/3. Since the problem might accept fractions, I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{400}{3}}\n\n\nGiven a convex equilateral hexagon \\(ABCDEF\\) with all pairs of opposite sides parallel, and the triangle formed by extending segments \\(AB\\), \\(CD\\), and \\(EF\\) having side lengths 200, 240, and 300, we need to find the side length of the hexagon.\n\n1. **Setup and Coordinates**:\n   - The triangle \\(PQR\\) with sides 200, 240, and 300 is considered. We place \\(P\\) at \\((0, 0)\\), \\(Q\\) at \\((200, 0)\\), and \\(R\\) at \\((181, \\sqrt{57239})\\).\n   - The hexagon's vertices are on the sides of triangle \\(PQR\\), with each pair of opposite sides parallel to a side of the triangle.\n\n2. **Parameterization**:\n   - Points \\(B\\) and \\(E\\) on \\(PQ\\), \\(C\\) and \\(A\\) on \\(QR\\), \\(D\\) and \\(F\\) on \\(RP\\) are parameterized.\n   - Using the intercept theorem and slope conditions for parallel sides, we derive relationships between parameters \\(t\\), \\(k\\), \\(n\\), \\(s\\), \\(m\\), and \\(p\\).\n\n3. **Equations and Solving**:\n   - Key equations derived from parallelism conditions lead to solving a quadratic equation:\n     \\[\n     9t^2 - 50t + 25 = 0\n     \\]\n   - Solutions give \\(t = \\frac{5}{9}\\).\n\n4. **Side Length Calculation**:\n   - Using the parameter \\(t\\), the side length \\(s\\) of the hexagon is computed as:\n     \\[\n     s = t \\cdot \\sqrt{19^2 + y_R^2}\n     \\]\n   - Substituting values, we find \\(s = \\frac{400}{3}\\).\n\nThus, the side length of the hexagon is \\(\\boxed{\\dfrac{400}{3}}\\).",
