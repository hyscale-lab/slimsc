      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I need to find the least integer b \u2265 2 such that there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. A number n is b-beautiful if it has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand what a two-digit number in base b looks like. A two-digit number in base b would be written as \"d\u2081d\u2082\" where d\u2081 is the digit in the b's place and d\u2082 is the units digit. So the actual value of n would be d\u2081*b + d\u2082. Since it's a two-digit number, d\u2081 can't be zero, so d\u2081 must be between 1 and b-1, and d\u2082 can be between 0 and b-1. \n\nThe problem states that the sum of the digits, d\u2081 + d\u2082, should equal the square root of n. So mathematically, that means:\n\nd\u2081 + d\u2082 = \u221a(d\u2081*b + d\u2082)\n\nI need to find all n (which are two-digit numbers in base b) that satisfy this equation, and then find the smallest b where there are more than ten such numbers.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's denote the square root as s. So s = d\u2081 + d\u2082, and s\u00b2 = d\u2081*b + d\u2082. So substituting s into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d\u2081*b + d\u2082\n\nBut since s = d\u2081 + d\u2082, maybe we can express d\u2082 in terms of s and d\u2081. So d\u2082 = s - d\u2081. Substitute that into the second equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d\u2081*b + (s - d\u2081)\n\nLet me rearrange that equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = d\u2081*b + s - d\u2081\n\nLet me collect terms with d\u2081:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = d\u2081*(b - 1)\n\nTherefore, solving for d\u2081:\n\nd\u2081 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, so d\u2081 has to be an integer between 1 and b-1, and d\u2082 = s - d\u2081 must also be between 0 and b-1. \n\nTherefore, the key equations are:\n\n1. d\u2081 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1)\n2. d\u2082 = s - d\u2081\n3. 1 \u2264 d\u2081 \u2264 b - 1\n4. 0 \u2264 d\u2082 \u2264 b - 1\n5. s must be an integer because \u221an is an integer (since d\u2081 and d\u2082 are integers, their sum s must be integer, so n must be a perfect square)\n\nWait, actually, the problem says the two digits sum to the square root of n. Since the digits are integers, the square root must be an integer. Therefore, n must be a perfect square. So that's an important point. So n is a perfect square, and s = \u221an is an integer.\n\nSo s is an integer, so s must satisfy that s\u00b2 is a two-digit number in base b, and that the digits of s\u00b2 in base b add up to s.\n\nTherefore, for each base b, we can look for integers s such that when s\u00b2 is written in base b as d\u2081d\u2082 (two digits), then d\u2081 + d\u2082 = s. \n\nSo, perhaps it's better to approach this by considering possible values of s and b. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must satisfy b \u2264 n < b\u00b2. Because the smallest two-digit number is 10_b = b, and the largest is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1. Wait, actually, the maximum two-digit number in base b is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1, so n must be between b and b\u00b2 -1, inclusive. But since n is also s\u00b2, which is a perfect square, s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s < sqrt(b\u00b2). \n\nTherefore, s must be an integer between ceiling(sqrt(b)) and b -1 (since s must be at least 1, but since n is at least b, sqrt(n) is at least sqrt(b). So s can range from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1?\n\nWait, actually, since n can be up to b\u00b2 -1, then sqrt(n) can be up to sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) \u2248 b. So s can be up to b -1, since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is less than b. Wait, because sqrt(b\u00b2) is exactly b, so sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is just under b. So s must be less than b. So s is an integer from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to reorganize the equations.\n\nWe have s = d\u2081 + d\u2082, and n = s\u00b2 = d\u2081*b + d\u2082. So substituting d\u2082 = s - d\u2081 into the second equation:\n\nn = d\u2081*b + (s - d\u2081) = d\u2081*(b -1) + s\n\nTherefore:\n\nd\u2081*(b -1) = n - s\n\nBut n is s\u00b2, so:\n\nd\u2081*(b -1) = s\u00b2 - s\n\nSo:\n\nd\u2081 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nWhich is the same as before. So since d\u2081 must be an integer between 1 and b -1, the right-hand side must be an integer and in that range.\n\nTherefore, for given b, the possible s must be such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and the resulting d\u2081 must be between 1 and b -1, and d\u2082 = s - d\u2081 must be between 0 and b -1.\n\nSo for each b, we can iterate over possible s values and check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and then check the constraints on d\u2081 and d\u2082.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express s in terms of b. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider that (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1). Let me denote that:\n\nLet k = b -1, so that b = k +1. Then the equation becomes:\n\nd\u2081 = (s\u00b2 - s)/k\n\nAnd then d\u2082 = s - d\u2081 = s - (s\u00b2 - s)/k = [s*k - s\u00b2 + s]/k = [s(k +1) - s\u00b2]/k\n\nWait, maybe this substitution can help. Let me try substituting k = b -1.\n\nThus, s\u00b2 - s must be divisible by k = b -1, so k divides s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime, so for k to divide their product, k must divide either s or s-1, or a combination of factors from each. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of solutions (s) is equal to the number of integers s where:\n\n1. s\u00b2 - s is divisible by (b -1)\n\n2. d\u2081 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) is between 1 and b -1\n\n3. d\u2082 = s - d\u2081 is between 0 and b -1\n\nTherefore, to count the number of b-beautiful numbers for a given b, we can find all integers s such that these conditions hold, and each such s corresponds to exactly one n = s\u00b2, so each s gives one n. Therefore, the number of b-beautiful numbers is the number of valid s's for that b.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal b \u22652 such that the number of integers s satisfying those constraints is greater than 10.\n\nSo, to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps we can approach this by first trying to find for each b, how many s's satisfy the conditions, then find the first b where that count is more than 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find an expression for the number of s's in terms of b, but that might be complicated. Let me think of possible approaches.\n\nLet me note that s must be at least sqrt(b), since n = s\u00b2 must be at least b (since it's a two-digit number in base b). Therefore, s \u2265 ceiling(\u221ab). Also, s must be less than b, since n < b\u00b2, so s = sqrt(n) < b. So s can range from ceiling(\u221ab) to b -1.\n\nTherefore, the possible s's are integers in [ceil(\u221ab), b -1]. Let's denote that interval as [s_min, s_max], where s_min = ceil(\u221ab), s_max = b -1.\n\nNow, for each s in that interval, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). Let me write that as:\n\n(s\u00b2 - s) mod (b -1) = 0.\n\nSo, for each s in [s_min, s_max], we can check that.\n\nAlternatively, since (s\u00b2 - s) = s(s -1), so (b -1) divides s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, then (b -1) must divide either s or s -1, or split into factors dividing each. But since s and s-1 are coprime, then (b -1) must divide s or (b -1) divides (s -1), unless (b -1) has factors that divide both, but since they are coprime, that can't happen. Therefore, (b -1) divides s or (b -1) divides (s -1). \n\nTherefore, either:\n\nCase 1: (b -1) divides s \u21d2 s = k*(b -1) for some integer k.\n\nOR\n\nCase 2: (b -1) divides (s -1) \u21d2 s = 1 + m*(b -1) for some integer m.\n\nTherefore, the possible s's are those that are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo (b -1). But since s must be between ceil(\u221ab) and b -1, we can find such s's in that interval.\n\nWait, hold on, actually, since (b -1) divides s(s -1), but since s and s-1 are coprime, (b -1) must divide either s or s -1. Therefore, s \u22610 mod (b -1) or s \u22611 mod (b -1). Therefore, all s in [ceil(\u221ab), b -1] that are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo (b -1). But since s is less than b, the only multiples of (b -1) in that interval would be s = (b -1)*1, since (b -1)*2 would be 2b -2 which is greater than b -1. Wait, actually s can be up to b -1. So the only possible s's where s \u22610 mod (b-1) is s = b -1, since that is the only multiple of (b-1) in [1, b-1].\n\nSimilarly, s \u22611 mod (b -1). Since s is at least 1, the numbers congruent to 1 mod (b -1) would be 1, 1 + (b -1), 1 + 2(b -1), etc. But since s is less than b, then the only possible s \u22611 mod (b-1) is s =1, but s has to be at least ceil(\u221ab). So unless ceil(\u221ab) \u22641, which would only be when b \u22642. Since b \u22652, when b=2, ceil(\u221a2)=2, so s starts at 2. Therefore, for b \u22652, s=1 is not in the interval. So actually, the only possible s that can satisfy the divisibility condition are s = b -1 (which is \u22610 mod (b-1)), and numbers congruent to 1 mod (b-1) but within the s interval.\n\nWait, let me think again. Suppose (b -1) divides s, then s must be a multiple of (b -1). The only multiple of (b -1) in [1, b-1] is s = b -1 itself. Similarly, (b -1) divides (s -1) \u21d2 s \u22611 mod (b -1). The numbers \u22611 mod (b -1) up to b-1 would be s =1, but s has to be at least ceil(\u221ab). So unless b is small, like b=2: then s must be at least 2 (since ceil(\u221a2) = 2), so s=1 is excluded. For b=3: ceil(\u221a3)=2, so s can be 2 or 3-1=2, but s=1 is excluded. Wait, so maybe in general s \u22611 mod (b -1) gives s =1 + k*(b -1). The next one after s=1 would be 1 + (b -1) = b, but s must be less than b, so actually there are no s's in the interval [ceil(\u221ab), b -1] congruent to 1 mod (b-1) except s=1 which is below the lower bound.\n\nTherefore, actually, only s = b -1 will satisfy the divisibility condition. Wait, that can't be. Then that would mean for each b, there is only one s, namely s = b-1, which would give n = (b-1)^2. Let me check an example.\n\nTake the example given in the problem: 81 is 13-beautiful. Let's see, for b=13, n=81. The digits are 6 and 3, so sum is 9. sqrt(81)=9, so that works. But according to my previous reasoning, the only s should be s=b-1=12. But 12 squared is 144, which in base 13 is written as 144 divided by 13 is 11 with remainder 1, so 11*13 +1=143 +1=144? Wait, no. Wait, 13*11 = 143, so 144 would be 11*13 + 1, so digits would be 11 and 1, so the digits sum to 12, which would equal sqrt(144)=12. So that works. So 144 is also a 13-beautiful number. Wait, so in that case, for b=13, the s value 12 gives n=144, which is indeed a two-digit number in base 13 (digits 11 and 1). However, the problem states that 81 is 13-beautiful. Let me check that. 81 in base 13: 13*6=78, so 81-78=3, so it's 63 in base 13, as stated. The digits sum to 6+3=9, which is sqrt(81). But according to the previous logic, s must be either 12 or 1 mod 12? Wait, 1 mod (b-1)=1 mod 12. So s=1 mod 12 would be 1,13,25,... but s must be less than 13. So s=1 is too small (since ceil(sqrt(13))\u22483.6, so s starts at 4). So the only s that works is s=12. But in the problem example, s=9 is also a solution. That contradicts my previous conclusion, so my reasoning must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so my mistake was in assuming that s must be congruent to 0 or 1 mod (b-1), but actually, the condition is that (b -1) divides s(s-1). However, s and s-1 are coprime, so (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. But that is only if (b-1) is square-free? Wait, actually, the logic is that since s and s-1 are coprime, any prime dividing their product divides exactly one of them, so the factors of (b-1) must all divide either s or s-1, but not both. Therefore, (b -1) can be written as d1*d2, where d1 divides s and d2 divides (s -1), and gcd(d1,d2)=1. Therefore, the divisibility condition is equivalent to s \u22610 mod d1 and s \u22611 mod d2, where d1*d2 = b -1 and gcd(d1,d2)=1. \n\nAh, so my previous conclusion was too restrictive. It's not that the entire (b -1) must divide s or s-1, but rather that (b-1) can be split into two coprime factors d1 and d2, such that d1 divides s and d2 divides (s -1). Therefore, the solutions s are those numbers that satisfy s \u22610 mod d1 and s \u22611 mod d2 for some coprime pair d1, d2 with d1*d2 = b-1. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of ways to factor b-1 into coprime pairs (d1,d2), and for each such factorization, there is a unique solution modulo (d1*d2)=b-1. Since s must lie in [ceil(\u221ab), b-1], the number of solutions could be equal to the number of coprime factor pairs of (b-1). Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of getting bogged down in the algebra, I can try to find a relationship between s and b. Let me go back to the equation:\n\nd\u2081 = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nWe also know that d\u2081 must be between 1 and b-1, so:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nSo, from the left inequality:\n\n(s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u22651 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s \u2265 b -1 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s - (b -1) \u22650\n\nFrom the right inequality:\n\n(s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2 \u21d2 s\u00b2 - s - (b -1)^2 \u22640\n\nTherefore, for a given s, these inequalities must hold. Also, since d\u2082 = s - d\u2081 must be between 0 and b-1:\n\n0 \u2264 s - [(s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)] \u2264 b -1\n\nLet me compute the lower bound first:\n\ns - (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u22650 \u21d2 [s(b -1) - s\u00b2 + s]/(b -1) \u22650 \u21d2 [s b - s - s\u00b2 + s]/(b -1) = [s b - s\u00b2]/(b -1) = s(b - s)/(b -1) \u22650\n\nSince b -1 is positive (as b \u22652), the sign is determined by s(b - s). Since s is between ceil(\u221ab) and b -1, then b - s is between 1 and b - ceil(\u221ab). Therefore, s and (b - s) are both positive, so the numerator is positive. Hence, the lower bound holds.\n\nThe upper bound:\n\ns - (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1 \u21d2 [s(b -1) - (s\u00b2 - s)]/(b -1) \u2264 b -1 \u21d2 [s b - s - s\u00b2 + s]/(b -1) = [s b - s\u00b2]/(b -1) \u2264 b -1 \u21d2 s(b - s) \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nHmm, so s(b - s) \u2264 (b -1)^2. Let me see if that can be rewritten. Let me denote t = b - s, so s = b - t. Then substituting:\n\n(b - t) t \u2264 (b -1)^2 \u21d2 bt - t\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 - 2b +1 \u21d2 -t\u00b2 + bt - (b\u00b2 - 2b +1) \u22640 \u21d2 -t\u00b2 + bt -b\u00b2 + 2b -1 \u22640 \u21d2 -(t\u00b2 - bt + b\u00b2 - 2b +1) \u22640 \u21d2 t\u00b2 - bt + (b\u00b2 - 2b +1) \u22650\n\nWait, b\u00b2 -2b +1 is (b -1)^2, so:\n\nt\u00b2 - bt + (b -1)^2 \u22650\n\nBut t = b - s, and s is between ceil(\u221ab) and b-1, so t ranges from 1 to b - ceil(\u221ab). Hmm, not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of dealing with inequalities, it's better to look for s such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), then compute d\u2081 and check if d\u2082 is within 0 to b-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of s as variable and express b in terms of s. Let me consider that (b -1) divides (s\u00b2 -s). Therefore, (b -1) must be a divisor of (s\u00b2 - s). So, for each s, possible b's would be of the form (s\u00b2 - s)/k +1, where k divides (s\u00b2 - s). However, since b must be at least 2, and s is at least 2 (since sqrt(b) is at least 2 when b \u22652). Hmm, perhaps this approach is also complex.\n\nWait, maybe I can think of the problem as for each s, there are certain bases b where the number n = s\u00b2 is a two-digit number in base b with digits summing to s. Let me see.\n\nSuppose we fix s. Then n = s\u00b2. To be a two-digit number in base b, we need b \u2264 s\u00b2 < b\u00b2. So b must satisfy sqrt(n) < b \u2264 n, but since n = s\u00b2, that becomes s < b \u2264 s\u00b2. Wait, but since n is a two-digit number in base b, that requires b \u2264 n < b\u00b2, so:\n\nb \u2264 s\u00b2 < b\u00b2 \u21d2 s < b \u2264 s\u00b2 (since b > sqrt(s\u00b2) = s). Wait, but the upper bound is b \u2264 s\u00b2, but since we need b to be as small as possible, but maybe that's not helpful yet.\n\nAdditionally, the digits must satisfy d\u2081 + d\u2082 = s and n = d\u2081*b + d\u2082. Since d\u2082 = s - d\u2081, substituting gives n = d\u2081*b + (s - d\u2081) = d\u2081*(b -1) + s. Therefore, rearranged:\n\nd\u2081 = (n - s)/(b -1) = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nTherefore, for given s, the possible bases b must divide (s\u00b2 - s) plus 1? Wait, no, actually (b -1) divides (s\u00b2 - s). So (b -1) must be a divisor of (s\u00b2 - s). Let me denote D = s\u00b2 - s. So possible (b -1) must be a divisor of D. So b = k +1, where k divides D. So for each s, the possible bases are b = (D/m) +1, where m is a positive divisor of D, and such that b satisfies the two-digit condition (i.e., b \u2264 s\u00b2 < b\u00b2). Also, the digit constraints must hold, so d\u2081 and d\u2082 must be in their respective ranges.\n\nTherefore, for each s, the possible bases b are given by divisors m of D = s(s -1), such that b = (D/m) +1 is in the interval (s, s\u00b2], and also such that d\u2081 = m and d\u2082 = s - m (Wait, no, more precisely, d\u2081 = (s\u00b2 - s)/ (b -1) = D/(b-1) = m, since m = (b-1). Wait, this is getting a bit tangled, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for a given s, the number of bases b for which s\u00b2 is a b-beautiful number is equal to the number of divisors m of D = s(s-1) such that:\n\n1. m = b -1 divides D,\n\n2. b = m +1 must satisfy b \u2264 s\u00b2 < b\u00b2,\n\n3. d\u2081 = D/m must be between 1 and b -1 (which is m),\n\n4. d\u2082 = s - d\u2081 must be between 0 and b -1 (i.e., 0 \u2264 s - D/m \u2264 m).\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nGiven m divides D = s(s-1), so D/m is integer. Let me denote m = b -1, so b = m +1.\n\nThen:\n\n1. The two-digit condition: b \u2264 s\u00b2 < b\u00b2.\n\nSo, m +1 \u2264 s\u00b2 < (m +1)^2 \u21d2 m \u2264 s\u00b2 -1 < (m +1)^2 -1 \u21d2 ?\n\nBut more straightforwardly, the two-digit requirement is:\n\nb \u2264 n < b\u00b2 \u21d2 (m +1) \u2264 s\u00b2 < (m +1)^2 \u21d2 m \u2264 s\u00b2 -1 and m +1 \u2264 s\u00b2 < (m+1)^2.\n\nAdditionally, the digit constraints:\n\nd\u2081 = D/m = (s(s -1))/m must satisfy 1 \u2264 d\u2081 \u2264 m (since d\u2081 must be between 1 and b-1 = m).\n\nAlso, d\u2082 = s - d\u2081 must be between 0 and m (since d\u2082 is a digit in base m +1, so 0 \u2264 d\u2082 \u2264 m).\n\nTherefore, d\u2082 = s - D/m must be between 0 and m.\n\nSo:\n\n0 \u2264 s - (D/m) \u2264 m \u21d2 s - (D/m) \u2264 m \u21d2 s \u2264 m + D/m,\n\nand\n\ns - (D/m) \u22650 \u21d2 s \u2265 D/m.\n\nBut D = s(s -1), so D/m = s(s -1)/m.\n\nTherefore, 0 \u2264 s - [s(s -1)/m] \u2264 m.\n\nLet me rewrite this inequality:\n\nLower bound: s - [s(s -1)/m] \u22650 \u21d2 s m - s(s -1) \u22650 \u21d2 s [m - (s -1)] \u22650.\n\nSince s is positive, this implies m - (s -1) \u22650 \u21d2 m \u2265 s -1.\n\nUpper bound: s - [s(s -1)/m] \u2264 m \u21d2 s m - s(s -1) \u2264 m\u00b2 \u21d2 s m - s\u00b2 + s \u2264 m\u00b2 \u21d2 -s\u00b2 + s m + s \u2264 m\u00b2 \u21d2 -s\u00b2 + s(m +1) - m\u00b2 \u22640 \u21d2 Rearranged:\n\nm\u00b2 - s(m +1) + s\u00b2 \u2265 0 \u21d2 (m - (s +1)/2)^2 + ... Hmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps factor it?\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nLet me consider the inequality:\n\ns m - s(s -1) \u2264 m\u00b2 \u21d2 s m \u2264 m\u00b2 + s(s -1) \u21d2 s m - m\u00b2 \u2264 s(s -1) \u21d2 m (s - m) \u2264 s(s -1).\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of getting stuck here, just proceed with the conditions:\n\nGiven m divides D = s(s - 1), then m must be a divisor of D.\n\nSo for each s, the possible m's are the divisors of D = s(s - 1). Each such m gives a candidate b = m +1, provided that the two-digit condition and digit constraints are satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the number of b's for which s\u00b2 is a b-beautiful number is equal to the number of divisors m of D = s(s-1) such that:\n\n1. m +1 \u2264 s\u00b2,\n\n2. m \u2265 s -1 (from the lower bound on d\u2082),\n\n3. d\u2081 = D/m must be \u2264 m (since d\u2081 \u2264 b -1 = m),\n\n4. and d\u2082 = s - D/m must be \u22650 and \u2264 m.\n\nWait, but condition 3: d\u2081 = D/m \u2264 m \u21d2 D/m \u2264 m \u21d2 D \u2264 m\u00b2 \u21d2 m\u00b2 \u2265 D = s(s -1). So m must be at least sqrt(s(s-1)).\n\nBut m must also be a divisor of D. Hmm, so m must satisfy sqrt(D) \u2264 m \u2264 D, but since m divides D, the divisors between sqrt(D) and D would correspond to the smaller divisors on the other side. Hmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe instead of trying to count for each s, let me think of how to compute for a given b, how many s's satisfy the conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize variables in terms of s and m. Let me consider that for a given b, the possible s's are those integers where (b -1) divides (s\u00b2 -s). Let me denote k = b -1, so s(s -1) must be divisible by k. So, s(s -1) \u22610 mod k.\n\nGiven that, then for each k (since b =k +1), the number of s's between ceil(sqrt(k+1)) and k (since s_max = b-1 =k) such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod k.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to, for each k = b-1, count the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] satisfying s(s-1) \u22610 mod k. Then, find the minimal k+1 (i.e., b) where this count exceeds 10.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is a better way. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote k = b -1, so we need to find the minimal k+1 where the number of s in [ceil(\u221a(k+1)), k] with s(s-1) \u22610 mod k exceeds 10.\n\nSo, for each k, compute the number of s in that interval where s(s-1) is divisible by k.\n\nAlternatively, note that since s and s-1 are coprime, then for s(s-1) to be divisible by k, all prime factors of k must divide either s or s-1. Therefore, k must divide s or k divides s-1, but since s and s-1 are coprime, the factors of k must be partitioned between s and s-1. \n\nAlternatively, the condition s(s-1) \u22610 mod k is equivalent to s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod d, where d is any divisor of k? Not exactly. Wait, actually, for each prime power in the factorization of k, the congruence must hold. Maybe using Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to note that s(s-1) \u22610 mod k implies that s \u22610 mod p^a or s\u22611 mod p^a for each prime power p^a dividing k. \n\nTherefore, for each prime power in the factorization of k, we can choose whether s \u22610 or 1 mod p^a, and then combine these congruences via Chinese Remainder Theorem. The total number of solutions s mod k is 2^m where m is the number of distinct prime factors of k? Wait, not exactly, because for each prime power, you have two choices, but they might not all be independent. \n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions to s(s-1) \u22610 mod k is multiplicative over the prime power factors of k. So if k factors into prime powers as p\u2081^{a\u2081} p\u2082^{a\u2082}...p_n^{a_n}, then the number of solutions is the product over each prime power p^a of the number of solutions mod p^a.\n\nSo for each prime power p^a, how many s mod p^a satisfy s(s-1) \u22610 mod p^a?\n\nThe equation s(s-1) \u22610 mod p^a has solutions s \u22610 mod p^a or s\u22611 mod p^a. Therefore, for each prime power p^a, there are 2 solutions mod p^a (unless p=2 and a=1? Wait, no, even mod 2, s=0 or 1 mod 2. So for each prime power, it's always 2 solutions. Therefore, the total number of solutions mod k is 2^m where m is the number of distinct prime factors of k? Wait no, actually for each prime power, even if the prime is repeated, you still have 2 solutions. Wait, actually, for each prime power p^a dividing k, the number of solutions mod p^a is 2 (s \u22610 or 1 mod p^a). Since these are independent for different prime powers, the total number of solutions mod k is 2^{\u03c9(k)}, where \u03c9(k) is the number of distinct prime factors of k. Wait, but actually, the number of prime power factors? Wait, no, the number of prime factors with exponents, but since for each prime in the factorization, regardless of exponent, you have two choices. Therefore, if k has prime factors p\u2081, p\u2082,..., p_m, then the number of solutions mod k is 2^m, since each prime factor contributes a choice between s \u22610 or 1 mod p^a, but actually, since the exponents complicate it, but in fact, the number is 2^m where m is the number of distinct prime factors. Wait, let me verify with an example.\n\nTake k=6=2\u00d73. The solutions mod 6 would be s\u22610 or1 mod2 and s\u22610 or1 mod3. So total solutions:\n\ns\u22610 mod2 and s\u22610 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod6,\n\ns\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22614 mod6,\n\ns\u22611 mod2 and s\u22610 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22613 mod6,\n\ns\u22611 mod2 and s\u22611 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod6.\n\nThus 4 solutions mod6, which is 2^2, as there are two distinct primes. So that works.\n\nAnother example, k=4=2\u00b2. Then mod4, the equation s(s-1)\u22610 mod4:\n\nPossible solutions s\u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4. So two solutions mod4. So 2^1=2, since only one prime factor (2). \n\nSimilarly, k=9=3\u00b2. mod9, s\u22610 mod9 or s\u22611 mod9. Two solutions. So yes, so in general, for prime power p^a, there are two solutions mod p^a, and the total number mod k is 2^{\u03c9(k)}, where \u03c9(k) is the number of distinct primes dividing k.\n\nWait, but actually, the exponents don't matter here. Because even if the exponent is higher, like p^a, the number of solutions mod p^a is still 2 (s\u22610 or 1 mod p^a). So the total number of solutions mod k is indeed 2^{\u03c9(k)}, where \u03c9(k) is the number of distinct prime factors of k.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions s mod k is 2^{\u03c9(k)}. However, these solutions are spread over the modulus k. So the total number of integers s in [1, k] satisfying s(s-1)\u22610 mod k is exactly 2^{\u03c9(k)}. But in our case, s must be in [ceil(\u221a(k+1)), k]. So the number of solutions s in that interval would be equal to the number of solutions mod k in that interval.\n\nHowever, the solutions mod k repeat every k numbers. So in the interval [1, k], there are exactly 2^{\u03c9(k)} solutions. So in the interval [ceil(\u221a(k+1)), k], the number of solutions would be equal to the number of solutions in [1, k] minus the number of solutions less than ceil(\u221a(k+1)).\n\nBut this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps approximate that the number of solutions in [ceil(\u221ak), k] is roughly (k - sqrt(k)) / (average spacing between solutions). But since the solutions are spaced every ... Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that the solutions mod k are exactly the numbers congruent to 0 or 1 mod each prime factor. But since we have Chinese Remainder Theorem, each combination gives a unique residue mod k. Therefore, the solutions mod k are 2^{\u03c9(k)} residues. Each residue occurs exactly once in each block of k numbers.\n\nTherefore, in the interval [1,k], there are exactly 2^{\u03c9(k)} solutions. So in the interval [ceil(\u221a(k+1)),k], the number of solutions is equal to the number of these residues that are \u2265 ceil(\u221a(k+1)).\n\nHmm, so the total number is between 2^{\u03c9(k)} - t, where t is the number of solutions less than ceil(\u221a(k+1)). But unless we can find an expression for that, it might not be helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for larger k, the interval [sqrt(k+1),k] is most of the interval [1,k], so maybe the number of solutions is roughly 2^{\u03c9(k)}. But since we need the exact count, this approach might not be precise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that the number of solutions s in [1, k] is exactly 2^{\u03c9(k)}, so if the interval [ceil(\u221a(k+1)), k] contains most of these solutions, then the count might be close to 2^{\u03c9(k)}. Therefore, to have more than 10 solutions, we need 2^{\u03c9(k)} > 10, so \u03c9(k) \u22654 since 2^4=16. But \u03c9(k)=4 would give 16 solutions, but if the interval cuts off some, maybe the actual count can be more than 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is an overestimation. Let me test with the given example. In the problem, b=13, so k =12. The number of solutions s in [ceil(\u221a13)=4, 12]. Let's compute \u03c9(12)=3 (primes 2,3). So 2^3=8 solutions. However, in the example, they have at least one solution (s=9 gives n=81). Also, s=12 gives n=144, which is also valid. Let's see all solutions for k=12:\n\nThe solutions mod 12 are the numbers congruent to 0 or1 mod 2 and mod3.\n\nPrime factors of 12 are 2 and 3.\n\nThe solutions mod 12 would be combinations:\n\nFor mod2: s\u22610 or1 mod2,\n\nmod3: s\u22610 or1 mod3,\n\nThus, combining:\n\nCase 1: s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22610 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod6 \u21d2 s=0,6,12 mod12 \u21d2 but s must be between 1 and12. So 6 and12.\n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod3. So solving:\n\ns \u22610 mod2,\n\ns \u22611 mod3.\n\nFind s mod6:\n\ns=3m +1 must be even \u21d23m+1 even \u21d23m odd \u21d2m odd. So m=1 \u21d2 s=4 mod6 \u21d2 s=4,10 mod12.\n\nCase3: s\u22611 mod2 and s\u22610 mod3. So s\u22611 mod2 and 0 mod3.\n\ns=3n, and 3n\u22611 mod2 \u21d2n\u22611 mod2. So n=1,3,5 mod6 \u21d2 s=3,9 mod12.\n\nCase4: s\u22611 mod2 and s\u22611 mod3. So s\u22611 mod lcm(2,3)=6 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod6 \u21d2 s=1,7 mod12.\n\nThus all solutions mod12 are: 0,1,4,6,7,9,10,12 mod12. But s must be between 1 and12, so the solutions are 1,4,6,7,9,10,12. Wait, but 0 mod12 is 12, which is included as 12. Wait, count them:\n\n1,4,6,7,9,10,12: that's 7 solutions. But 2^2=4? Wait, \u03c9(12)=2 (primes 2 and3). So 2^2=4, but we have 7 solutions. Wait, so my previous conclusion was wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait the problem is that the number of solutions mod k is actually equal to 2^{number of prime factors with exponent \u22651}, but when considering the prime power factors, but in reality, when you have multiple exponents, but in mod p^a, the number of solutions is still 2. So for k=12=2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b9, which has two distinct primes, so \u03c9(k)=2, so 2^2=4, but in reality there are 7 solutions mod12? Wait no, in mod12, the solutions are the numbers where s\u22610 or1 mod2 and mod3. Wait, actually when considering mod4 and mod3 for k=12? Wait, perhaps my mistake was in the prime power factors.\n\nWait, actually, in modulus 12, the prime powers are 4 and 3. So for modulus 4 and 3:\n\nFor modulus4: s \u22610 or1 mod4,\n\nmod3: s\u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nThus solving via Chinese Remainder Theorem:\n\nEach combination of mod4 and mod3 gives a solution mod12.\n\nThere are 2 (choices mod4) \u00d72 (choices mod3) =4 solutions mod12. Wait, but earlier I found 7 solutions. That's a contradiction. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in enumerating the solutions.\n\nWait let's re-examine mod12:\n\nThe equation is s(s-1) \u22610 mod12.\n\nSo s must be \u22610 mod4 or mod3, or 1 mod4 or mod3? Wait, no, the condition is s(s-1)\u22610 mod12, so for each prime power in 12=3\u00d74, the condition must hold mod3 and mod4.\n\nMod4: s(s-1)\u22610 mod4 \u21d2 either s\u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4 (since if s is even, s-1 is odd, so to have s(s-1)\u22610 mod4, s must be 0 mod4 or s must be 1 mod4? Wait:\n\nWait mod4:\n\nIf s \u22610 mod4: s(s-1)\u22610*( -1) \u22610 mod4,\n\nIf s\u22611 mod4:1*0 \u22610 mod4,\n\nIf s\u22612 mod4:2*1=2\u22612 mod4 \u22600,\n\nIf s\u22613 mod4:3*2=6\u22612 mod4\u22600,\n\nTherefore mod4, s must be \u22610 or1 mod4.\n\nSimilarly mod3:\n\ns(s-1)\u22610 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod3 or s\u22611 mod3.\n\nTherefore, combining mod4 and mod3, we have four cases:\n\nCase1: s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22610 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod12,\n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22614 mod12 (since 4 mod4=0, 4 mod3=1),\n\nCase3: s\u22611 mod4 and s\u22610 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22619 mod12 (9 mod4=1, 9 mod3=0),\n\nCase4: s\u22611 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod12,\n\nThus the solutions mod12 are 0,1,4,9 mod12. Hence in mod12, the solutions are 0,1,4,9. Adding 12, but since s is between1 and12, the solutions are 1,4,9,12. Wait, 0 mod12 is 12, which is included. So total solutions mod12 in [1,12] are 1,4,9,12. That's four solutions, which matches 2^{\u03c9(12)}=2\u00b2=4. \n\nWait, previously I had 7 solutions because I made a mistake in considering mod6 instead of mod4 and mod3 separately. So the correct number is 4 solutions. So in the example of b=13 (k=12), the solutions s are 1,4,9,12. However, the problem states that 81 is 13-beautiful. 81 is 9\u00b2, so s=9 is one of the solutions, and s=12 gives (12)^2=144, which is 11*13 +1, so digits 11 and1, sum 12. So that works. s=4 would give s\u00b2=16, which in base13 is 1 3 (since 1*13 +3=16), digits sum to4, which is correct. s=1 would give n=1, but in base13, 1 is a single digit, so it's not a two-digit number. Therefore, s=1 is excluded because n=1 is not a two-digit number in base13. Similarly s=12 gives n=144 which is two-digit (digits 11 and1). s=4 gives 16 which is \"13\" in base13? Wait 16 divided by13 is 1 with remainder 3, so \"13\" would be digits 1 and3, which are valid (digits must be less than13). So that's okay, and the digits sum to4, which is s=4. So s=4 is valid. However, s=1 gives n=1, which is a single digit in base13. So the valid solutions are s=4,9,12. Thus three solutions. But according to the formula, mod12 has four solutions, but one of them (s=1) is invalid because n=1 is not two-digit. So in this case, the actual count is 3.\n\nTherefore, the formula gives 2^{\u03c9(k)} solutions mod k, but some of them may lie below the lower bound ceil(\u221a(k+1)). \n\nTherefore, to compute the exact number for a given k, we need to:\n\n1. Find all residues mod k that are solutions (i.e., s \u22610 or1 mod each prime power in k's factorization),\n\n2. For each residue r in 1..k satisfying s(s-1)\u22610 modk, check if r is in [ceil(\u221a(k+1)),k],\n\n3. Also ensure that the corresponding n = r\u00b2 is a two-digit number in base b =k+1, which requires that b \u2264 n < b\u00b2. Since b =k+1 and n=r\u00b2, this requires k+1 \u2264 r\u00b2 < (k+1)^2. The left inequality is automatically satisfied because r \u2265 ceil(\u221a(k+1)), so r\u00b2 \u2265 (sqrt(k+1))\u00b2 =k+1. The right inequality is r\u00b2 < (k+1)^2 \u21d2 r <k+1, which is true because r \u2264k.\n\nTherefore, the only constraints are:\n\n- s must be in [ceil(\u221a(k+1)),k], and\n\n- When writing n =s\u00b2 in base b=k+1, the digits d\u2081 and d\u2082 must satisfy 1\u2264d\u2081 \u2264k and 0\u2264d\u2082 \u2264k.\n\nBut since n =s\u00b2 = d\u2081*b +d\u2082 = d\u2081*(k+1) +d\u2082,\n\nand d\u2081 = (s\u00b2 -s)/k (since d\u2081 = (s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1) = (s\u00b2 -s)/k),\n\nso d\u2081 must be integer between1 andk,\n\nand d\u2082 = s -d\u2081 must be between0 andk.\n\nTherefore, for each residue r in the solutions modk, check that:\n\n1. r is in [ceil(\u221a(k+1)),k]\n\n2. d\u2081 = (r\u00b2 - r)/k is integer between1 andk,\n\n3. d\u2082 =r -d\u2081 is between0 andk.\n\nWait but since r is a solution to s(s-1)\u22610 modk, then (r\u00b2 - r) is divisible byk, so d\u2081 is integer. So condition2 is just that d\u2081 must be between1 andk, which is ensured since r is between1 andk, so d\u2081=(r\u00b2 -r)/k.\n\nWait let's compute d\u2081 for r:\n\nd\u2081 = (r\u00b2 - r)/k.\n\nSince r \u2264k,\n\nd\u2081 = r(r-1)/k \u2264k(k-1)/k =k -1 <k,\n\nso d\u2081 <k, and since r \u2265ceil(\u221a(k+1)), then:\n\nd\u2081 = (r\u00b2 - r)/k \u2265 ( (sqrt(k+1))\u00b2 - sqrt(k+1) )/k \u2248 (k+1 - sqrt(k+1))/k \u2248 1 - something, so at least 1 for sufficiently large k.\n\nWait need to verify for small k.\n\nBut perhaps for valid r in [ceil(\u221a(k+1)),k], d\u2081 will automatically be between1 andk-1.\n\nWait let's see with an example:\n\nTake k=12 (b=13):\n\nFor r=4:\n\nd\u2081=(16-4)/12 =12/12=1,\n\nd\u2082=4-1=3 => okay.\n\nFor r=9:\n\nd\u2081=(81 -9)/12=72/12=6,\n\nd\u2082=9-6=3 => okay.\n\nFor r=12:\n\nd\u2081=(144 -12)/12=132/12=11,\n\nd\u2082=12-11=1 => okay.\n\nSo all are valid. However for r=1:\n\nd\u2081=(1-1)/12=0, which is invalid (d\u2081 must be \u22651). So even though r=1 is a solution mod12, it is excluded because d\u2081=0.\n\nTherefore, the total valid solutions for k=12 are 3, which matches the example.\n\nTherefore, the process is:\n\nFor each k, compute all residues r in [1,k] that satisfy r(r-1)\u22610 modk,\n\nthen filter those residues r where:\n\nr \u2265 ceil(\u221a(k+1)),\n\nand d\u2081=(r\u00b2 -r)/k is between1 andk,\n\nand d\u2082 =r -d\u2081 is between0 andk.\n\nHowever, since r is a solution modk, d\u2081 is integer. Also, since r \u2264k,\n\nd\u2081=(r\u00b2 -r)/k,\n\nsince r\u00b2 =d\u2081*k + r,\n\nso d\u2081 must be at least (r\u00b2 - r)/k \u2265 ( (ceil(\u221a(k+1)))^2 - ceil(\u221a(k+1)) ) /k,\n\nbut maybe complicated.\n\nAlternatively, since r is between ceil(\u221a(k+1)) andk,\n\nand d\u2081 = (r\u00b2 -r)/k,\n\nthen since r \u2265 sqrt(k+1), so r\u00b2 \u2265k+1,\n\nso d\u2081 = (r\u00b2 -r)/k \u2265 (k+1 - r)/k.\n\nBut since r \u2264k,\n\nthen k+1 -r \u22651,\n\nso numerator \u22651,\n\nso d\u2081 \u2265 (k+1 -r)/k,\n\nbut not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since d\u2081 = r(r-1)/k,\n\nand we need d\u2081 \u22651,\n\nso r(r-1)/k \u22651 \u21d2 r(r-1) \u2265k.\n\nGiven that r \u2264k,\n\nthen r(r-1) \u2265k,\n\nso r must satisfy r\u00b2 -r -k \u22650.\n\nThe solution to r\u00b2 -r -k=0 is r=(1 + sqrt(1+4k))/2.\n\nTherefore, for r \u2265 [1 + sqrt(1+4k)]/2 \u2248 (sqrt(4k))/2= sqrt(k),\n\nwhich is consistent with the lower bound of ceil(\u221a(k+1)).\n\nTherefore, as long as r is in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k], then d\u2081=(r\u00b2 -r)/k \u22651.\n\nBecause for r \u2265 sqrt(k+1),\n\nr\u00b2 \u2265k+1,\n\nso r\u00b2 -r \u2265k+1 -r,\n\nbut since r \u2265 sqrt(k+1),\n\nk+1 -r \u2264k+1 -sqrt(k+1),\n\nwhich may not necessarily make r\u00b2 -r \u2265k.\n\nWait let me compute with an example.\n\nTake k=12, r=4:\n\n4\u00b2 -4=12, which equals k=12,\n\nso d\u2081=12/12=1,\n\nso equality holds.\n\nAnother example, k=5 (b=6):\n\nTo see if r=3 (ceil(sqrt(6))=3),\n\nr\u00b2 -r =9-3=6,\n\nd\u2081=6/5=1.2, which is not integer. Wait, but k=5:\n\nThe solutions mod5 would be:\n\nsince k=5 is prime, solutions mod5 are s\u22610 or1 mod5,\n\nso residues 0,1,5 mod5. But s ranges from 1 to5,\n\nso residues 1 and5. \n\nBut s=1 gives d\u2081=(1-1)/5=0 invalid,\n\ns=5 gives d\u2081=(25-5)/5=4,\n\nd\u2082=5-4=1,\n\nso valid. So s=5 is valid. \n\nWait, but the lower bound is ceil(sqrt(6))=3,\n\nso s=5 is in [3,5], so counts. So the valid solutions are s=5,\n\nso count is1.\n\nWait, let me check if k=5:\n\nr=5,\n\nd\u2081=4,\n\nd\u2082=1,\n\nso n=25 in base6 is 41 (4*6 +1=25). The digits sum to5, which is s=5. Good.\n\nAnother example: k=8 (b=9):\n\n\u03c9(8)=1 (prime 2), so solutions mod8 are s\u22610 or1 mod2\u00b3. So mod8:\n\ns\u22610 mod8 or s\u22611 mod8.\n\nThus residues 0,1,8 mod8.\n\nWithin 1-8:\n\ns=1,8.\n\nCheck s=1: n=1, single digit in base9, invalid.\n\ns=8: n=64. In base9, 64 divided by9 is 7*9=63, remainder1, so 71. Digits 7+1=8, which is s=8. So valid. Also, s=8 is in [ceil(sqrt(9))=3,8]. So count is1.\n\nThus for k=8, count is1.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nSo, going back to the problem: need to find the minimal k+1 (b) where the count exceeds 10.\n\nTo do this, perhaps we can iterate over k starting from small numbers and compute the count until we find one with count>10.\n\nBut this might take a while. Let me see if I can find a pattern or formula.\n\nThe number of solutions modk is 2^{\u03c9(k)}, but some may be below the lower bound or result in d\u2081=0.\n\nBut the key is that the number of valid solutions is roughly 2^{\u03c9(k)} minus the number of solutions below the lower bound and minus those with d\u2081=0.\n\nHowever, for larger k, the number of solutions modk is 2^{\u03c9(k)}, and the lower bound is about sqrt(k). So the number of solutions above sqrt(k) would be roughly 2^{\u03c9(k)} * (1 - sqrt(k)/k). But this is approximate.\n\nTo exceed 10 solutions, we need 2^{\u03c9(k)} to be significantly larger than 10. Since 2^4=16, so if \u03c9(k)>=4, then maybe possible.\n\nLet me try k=60 (b=61). Let's see:\n\nk=60 has prime factors 2,3,5, so \u03c9(k)=3. So solutions mod60 would be 2^3=8. The lower bound is ceil(sqrt(61))=8.\n\nThus, solutions mod60 must be residues in [8,60].\n\nThe residues mod60 which are solutions are the numbers \u22610 or1 mod2,3,5.\n\nWait, this requires more detailed calculation.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of k= 2^3*3*5=120 (\u03c9=3), but maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let me try k= 2520 (highly composite), but this might be overkill.\n\nAlternatively, let me try smaller k with high \u03c9(k). For example, k=30 (\u03c9=3):\n\nPrime factors 2,3,5.\n\nSolutions mod30: 2^3=8 solutions.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(31))=6.\n\nSo solutions mod30 must be between6 and30.\n\nThe residues mod30 that are solutions are combinations of:\n\nmod2: s\u22610 or1,\n\nmod3: s\u22610 or1,\n\nmod5: s\u22610 or1,\n\nSo total 8 solutions mod30. These are:\n\n0 mod30,\n\n1 mod30,\n\nand combinations like 0 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 etc.\n\nBut listing them:\n\nThe solutions are:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod2,0 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d20 mod30,\n\n2. 0 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d230 mod30? Wait, let me use CRT:\n\nLet me list them properly:\n\nEach combination of choices for mod2, mod3, mod5 (0 or1):\n\nCase1: 0 mod2,0 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d20 mod30 \u21d2 s=0 mod30,\n\nCase2:0 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d2 Solve s\u22610 mod6, s\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet s=6m, 6m\u22611 mod5 \u21d26m\u22611 \u21d2m\u22611/6 mod5 \u21d26^{-1} mod5 is 1 (since6\u22611 mod5), so m\u22611 mod5 \u21d2m=5n+1 \u21d2s=6*(5n+1)=30n+6 \u21d2 s\u22616 mod30,\n\nCase3:0 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod2, s\u22611 mod3, s\u22610 mod5.\n\nLet s=2a, 2a\u22611 mod3 \u21d22a\u22611 \u21d2a\u22612 mod3 \u21d2a=3b+2 \u21d2s=6b+4,\n\nAlso s\u22610 mod5 \u21d26b+4\u22610 mod5 \u21d26b\u2261-4 mod5 \u21d26b\u22611 mod5 \u21d2b\u22611/6 mod5 \u21d2b\u22611 mod5 (since6\u22611 mod5),\n\nThus b=5c+1 \u21d2s=6*(5c+1)+4=30c+10 \u21d2s\u226110 mod30,\n\nCase4:0 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5.\n\ns=2a,\n\n2a\u22611 mod3 \u21d2a\u22612 mod3 \u21d2a=3b+2 \u21d2s=6b+4,\n\nAlso s\u22611 mod5 \u21d26b+4\u22611 mod5 \u21d26b\u2261-3 mod5 \u21d26b\u22612 mod5 \u21d2b\u22612*6^{-1} mod5 \u21d26^{-1}=1 \u21d2b\u22612 mod5,\n\nThus b=5c+2 \u21d2s=6*(5c+2)+4=30c+16 \u21d2s\u226116 mod30,\n\nCase5:1 mod2,0 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod2,0 mod15 \u21d2 s\u226115 mod30,\n\nCase6:1 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod2 \u21d2s=2a+1,\n\n\u22610 mod3 \u21d22a+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d22a\u2261-1 \u21d2a\u22611 mod3,\n\nAlso \u22611 mod5 \u21d22a+1\u22611 mod5 \u21d22a\u22610 mod5 \u21d2a\u22610 mod5,\n\nThus a\u22610 mod5 and a\u22611 mod3 \u21d2a=5d,\n\n5d\u22611 mod3 \u21d25d\u22612d\u22611 mod3 \u21d2d\u22612 mod3 \u21d2d=3e+2 \u21d2a=5*(3e+2)=15e+10 \u21d2s=2*(15e+10)+1=30e+21 \u21d2s\u226121 mod30,\n\nCase7:1 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod6 and 0 mod5.\n\nLet s=6a+1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d26a+1\u22610 \u21d26a\u2261-1\u22614 mod5 \u21d2a\u22614*6^{-1}=4*1=4 mod5 \u21d2a=5b+4 \u21d2s=6*(5b+4)+1=30b+25 \u21d2s\u226125 mod30,\n\nCase8:1 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod lcm(2,3,5)=30 \u21d2s\u22611 mod30.\n\nThus the residues mod30 are:0,1,6,10,15,16,21,25 mod30.\n\nThus in 1-30, the solutions are:\n\n1,6,10,15,16,21,25,30.\n\nNow, the lower bound is ceil(sqrt(31))=6. So the valid s's are from6 to30.\n\nThus, the residues in [6,30] are:\n\n6,10,15,16,21,25,30. Plus 1 is excluded because 1 <6 except 1 is below the lower bound. Wait:\n\nList of residues in 1-30:\n\n1,6,10,15,16,21,25,30.\n\nOf these, those \u22656 are:\n\n6,10,15,16,21,25,30. So seven solutions.\n\nNow check each for validity:\n\nFor each s in [6,30]:\n\nCompute d\u2081=(s\u00b2 -s)/30,\n\nd\u2082=s -d\u2081,\n\nCheck d\u2081 and d\u2082 are in [1,30) and [0,30).\n\nWait let's compute for each s:\n\ns=6:\n\nd\u2081=(36-6)/30=30/30=1,\n\nd\u2082=6-1=5,\n\nSo digits 1 and5 in base31 (since b=k+1=31). The number is 6\u00b2=36, which in base31 is 1*31 +5 =36. Digits sum 6. Valid.\n\ns=10:\n\nd\u2081=(100-10)/30=90/30=3,\n\nd\u2082=10-3=7,\n\n3+7=10. n=100 in base31 is 3 7 (3*31 +7=100). Valid.\n\ns=15:\n\nd\u2081=(225-15)/30=210/30=7,\n\nd\u2082=15-7=8,\n\n7+8=15. 15\u00b2=225 in base31: 7*31=217 +8=225. Valid.\n\ns=16:\n\nd\u2081=(256 -16)/30=240/30=8,\n\nd\u2082=16-8=8,\n\n8+8=16. n=256 in base31 is 8*31 +8=256. Valid.\n\ns=21:\n\nd\u2081=(441 -21)/30=420/30=14,\n\nd\u2082=21-14=7,\n\n14+7=21. In base31, 14 is a valid digit (since base31 allows 0-30). So 14*31 +7=434 +7=441. Correct.\n\ns=25:\n\nd\u2081=(625 -25)/30=600/30=20,\n\nd\u2082=25-20=5,\n\n20+5=25. In base31:20*31 +5=620 +5=625. Valid.\n\ns=30:\n\nd\u2081=(900-30)/30=870/30=29,\n\nd\u2082=30-29=1,\n\n29+1=30. But s=30, the sqrt(n)=30, so n=900. In base31:29*31 +1=900-1 +1=900. Valid.\n\nThus all 7 solutions are valid.\n\nThus k=30 (b=31) has 7 solutions. Still below 10.\n\nHmm, need higher \u03c9(k). Let's try k= 2*3*5*7=210, which has \u03c9(k)=4.\n\nThus, 2^4=16 solutions mod210.\n\nLower bound is ceil(sqrt(211))\u224815.\n\nThus, need to calculate how many solutions mod210 are >=15.\n\nThis is getting complicated, but let's approximate. The number of solutions mod210 is 16, so if half are above sqrt(210)\u224814.5, so maybe around 8 solutions above. But need exact count.\n\nAlternatively, maybe pick a k with \u03c9(k)=4. Let's try k= 2*3*5*7=210 (\u03c9=4), so solutions mod210 are 16. The lower bound is ceil(sqrt(211))=15.\n\nThus, need to compute how many of the 16 residues mod210 are between15 and210.\n\nSince residues are spread every certain interval, but without calculating, it's hard. Maybe pick a smaller k with \u03c9(k)=4.\n\nFor example, k= 2*3*5*7=210, which is large. Alternatively, k= 2^3*3*5=120 (\u03c9=3), so 2^3=8 solutions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k= 60 (\u03c9=3), which had 8 solutions mod60, but lower bound ceil(sqrt(61))=8. So in k=60, the solutions mod60 are residues like 0,1, etc. Let's see:\n\nWait, for k=60, prime factors 2,3,5. So solutions mod60 are 2^3=8 solutions.\n\nThe residues mod60 would be combinations of 0/1 mod2, mod3, mod5.\n\nFollowing similar steps as for k=30, but it's time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, let's try k= 30 (\u03c9=3) had7 solutions. Maybe k= 105 (3*5*7) gives \u03c9=3, but 2^3=8 solutions. Let me try k= 2*3*5*7=210.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of k= 240. Prime factors 2^4 *3*5, so \u03c9=3. So 8 solutions. Not better.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of k= 105 (\u03c9=3):\n\nk=105, \u03c9=3 (3,5,7). So solutions mod105 are 8.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(106))\u224811.\n\nSo need to count solutions mod105 between11 and105.\n\nAssuming half are above sqrt(105)\u224810.25, so maybe 4 solutions? Not enough.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k= 2310 (2*3*5*7*11), but that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to think of k with many small factors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal k is 24.\n\nk=24: factors 2^3*3, so \u03c9=2. Solutions mod24 are 4.\n\nThe lower bound ceil(sqrt(25))=5.\n\nSolutions mod24 are residues:\n\nFor mod24, the equation s(s-1)\u22610 mod24 \u21d2 s\u22610 or1 mod8 and mod3?\n\nWait, prime factors 2^3 and 3.\n\nThus, s\u22610 or1 mod8 and mod3.\n\nCombining:\n\nFirst, mod8:\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod8,\n\nmod3:\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod3,\n\nThus total solutions mod24 are 2 (mod8 choices)*2 (mod3)=4.\n\nThe residues mod24 are:\n\nCase1: 0 mod8 and0 mod3 \u21d20 mod24,\n\nCase2:0 mod8 and1 mod3 \u21d20 mod8, s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=8a \u22611 mod3 \u21d28a\u2261a\u22611 mod3 \u21d2a\u22611 mod3 \u21d2a=3b+1 \u21d2s=24b +8,\n\nThus s\u22618 mod24,\n\nCase3:1 mod8 and0 mod3 \u21d2s\u22611 mod8 and0 mod3,\n\nLet s=8a+1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d28a+1\u22612a+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d22a\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d2a\u22611 mod3 \u21d2a=3b+1 \u21d2s=8*(3b+1)+1=24b+9 \u21d2s\u22619 mod24,\n\nCase4:1 mod8 and1 mod3 \u21d2s\u22611 mod lcm(8,3)=24 \u21d2s\u22611 mod24,\n\nThus residues mod24 are0,1,8,9,24 mod24. Wait between1-24:\n\n0 mod24 \u21d224,\n\n1,8,9,24.\n\nThus valid solutions in [5,24]:\n\n1 is below 5,\n\n8,9,24,\n\nplus 24.\n\nSo three solutions:\n\n8,9,24.\n\nCheck each:\n\ns=8:\n\nd\u2081=(64-8)/24=56/24\u22482.333\u2026 Not integer. Wait no, 64-8=56, 56/24=7/3. Not integer. Wait, but s=8 must be a solution mod24?\n\nWait, hold on:\n\nWait, for k=24, s(s-1) mod24:\n\ns=8: 8*7=56\u22618 mod24? 56 mod24=8, which is not 0. Wait, this is a problem.\n\nWait, my earlier calculation was wrong.\n\nWait, let's recalculate solutions mod24.\n\nWait the equation is s(s -1) \u22610 mod24.\n\nSo s must be \u22610 or1 mod8 (since mod8), and 0 or1 mod3.\n\nBut let's check residue 8 mod24:\n\ns=8,\n\ns(s-1)=8\u00d77=56.\n\n56 mod24=56-2\u00d724=8\u22618 mod24\u22600.\n\nThat's a problem. So my mistake must be in the earlier analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to check mod8 and mod3 again.\n\nWait the condition is s(s-1)\u22610 mod24 \u21d2 must be 0 mod8 and mod3.\n\nMod8:\n\ns(s-1)\u22610 mod8 \u21d2 s\u22610 or1 mod8,\n\nMod3:\n\ns(s-1)\u22610 mod3 \u21d2s\u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nTherefore, the solutions mod24 are those s that are 0 or1 mod8 AND 0 or1 mod3.\n\nThus, the four cases:\n\nCase1: s\u22610 mod8 AND s\u22610 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod24,\n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod8 AND s\u22611 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22618 mod24 (since 8 mod3=2, not 1. Hmm, contradiction.)\n\nWait, if s\u22610 mod8 \u21d2 s=8a. To have 8a\u22611 mod3 \u21d28a\u22612a\u22611 mod3 \u21d22a\u22611 \u21d2a\u22612 mod3 \u21d2a=3b+2 \u21d2s=8*(3b+2)=24b+16 \u21d2s\u226116 mod24.\n\nAh, so my mistake earlier was in the calculation.\n\nLet me recompute the four cases properly:\n\nCase1: s \u22610 mod8 and 0 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod24,\n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod8 and1 mod3 \u21d2 s=8a, 8a\u22611 mod3 \u21d28\u22612 mod3 \u21d22a\u22611 \u21d2a\u22612 mod3 \u21d2a=3b+2 \u21d2s=24b+16 \u21d2s\u226116 mod24,\n\nCase3: s\u22611 mod8 and0 mod3 \u21d2 s=8a+1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d28a+1 \u22612a+1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d22a\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d22a\u22612 mod3 \u21d2a\u22611 mod3 \u21d2a=3b+1 \u21d2s=8*(3b+1)+1=24b+9 \u21d2s\u22619 mod24,\n\nCase4: s\u22611 mod8 and1 mod3 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod24,\n\nThus residues mod24 are:0,9,16,1,24 mod24. So in 1-24:\n\n1,9,16,24.\n\nNow checking s=16:\n\ns=16,\n\ns(s-1)=16\u00d715=240\u2261240 mod24=0. Good.\n\ns=9:\n\n9\u00d78=72\u22610 mod24. Good.\n\ns=24:24\u00d723=552\u22610 mod24. Good.\n\nThus the valid solutions mod24 are 1,9,16,24.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(25))=5,\n\nThus in [5,24], the valid s are9,16,24.\n\nNow check each:\n\ns=9:\n\nd\u2081=(81-9)/24=72/24=3,\n\nd\u2082=9-3=6,\n\nDigits 3 and6 in base25 (k=24 \u21d2b=25). 3*25 +6=81, sqrt(81)=9. Valid.\n\ns=16:\n\nd\u2081=(256-16)/24=240/24=10,\n\nd\u2082=16-10=6,\n\nDigits 10 and6 in base25. 10 is a valid digit (since base25 allows up to24). 10*25+6=256. Valid.\n\ns=24:\n\nd\u2081=(24\u00b2 -24)/24= (576-24)/24=552/24=23,\n\nd\u2082=24-23=1,\n\nDigits23 and1 in base25. 23*25 +1=576. Valid.\n\nThus, three solutions for k=24 (b=25).\n\nHmm, still not enough.\n\nLet me try k= 210 (\u03c9=4, factors 2,3,5,7). Let's see:\n\n\u03c9(k)=4 \u21d2 solutions mod210 are 16.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(211))=15.\n\nAssuming half of the 16 solutions are above 15, so 8 solutions.\n\nIf all are valid, then count is16 - those below15 and d\u2081=0.\n\nBut need to compute.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try k= 60 (\u03c9=3):\n\nEarlier with k=60, got7 solutions.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's try k= 120 (\u03c9=3: factors2,3,5):\n\nSolutions mod120 are 8.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(121))=11.\n\nThus solutions mod120 between11 and120.\n\nAssuming 4 solutions.\n\nStill not enough.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to go higher.\n\nLet me try k= 210.\n\nLet me try to compute the number of solutions mod210.\n\nPrime factors 2,3,5,7.\n\nEach prime gives a 0/1 condition.\n\nThus, solutions mod210 are 2^4=16.\n\nThe solutions mod210 are combinations of s\u22610 or1 mod2,3,5,7.\n\nIt's tedious, but let's try to find how many are \u226515.\n\nSince mod210, the residues are spread every certain interval.\n\nAssuming evenly distributed, half would be above sqrt(210)\u224814.5, so about 8 solutions.\n\nIf all are valid (i.e., not resulting in d\u2081=0 or below lower bound), then count is8.\n\nStill need more.\n\nLet me try k= 2520 (highly composite number). \u03c9=4 (2,3,5,7). But this is big.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of k= 252 (factors2^2*3^2*7). \u03c9=3 (primes 2,3,7). So solutions mod252 would be 2^3=8.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(253))\u224816.\n\nThus, maybe 4 solutions.\n\nNot enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to look for k with \u03c9(k)=4, such as k= 2*3*5*7=210.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nk=210:\n\nSolutions mod210 are 16.\n\nThe lower bound is15.\n\nAssuming half of the residues mod210 are above15, so 8 solutions.\n\nIf each is valid, then count is8, but need to check if any are below15 or have d\u2081=0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe k= 360 (\u03c9=4: 2^3*3^2*5). Wait, \u03c9=3 (primes 2,3,5). So 8 solutions.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider k= 105 (\u03c9=3; primes3,5,7):\n\nSolutions mod105 are8.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(106))=11.\n\nThus, possible 4 solutions.\n\nStill low.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to consider k with \u03c9(k)=4, like 210.\n\nWait let's try k= 210.\n\nLet me compute the solutions mod210:\n\nThe solutions are all combinations of s\u22610 or1 mod2, mod3, mod5, mod7.\n\nThus 16 residues mod210.\n\nTo count how many of these are between15 and210.\n\nSince residues are from0 to209,\n\nthe lower bound is ceil(\u221a(211))=15.\n\nThus, need residues \u226515.\n\nAssuming residues are spread, perhaps half are above14.5, so 8.\n\nSo total of8.\n\nAssuming all are valid (no d\u2081=0 etc.), then count=8.\n\nStill not enough.\n\nHmm, this approach is taking too long. Maybe I need a better strategy.\n\nLet me think differently. The number of b-beautiful numbers for base b is equal to the number of integers s such that:\n\n1. s\u00b2 is a two-digit number in base b, so b \u2264s\u00b2 <b\u00b2 \u21d2 s \u2265\u221ab and s <b.\n\n2. The digits d\u2081 and d\u2082 of s\u00b2 in base b satisfy d\u2081 +d\u2082 =s.\n\nGiven that d\u2081 = floor(s\u00b2 /b) and d\u2082 = s\u00b2 modb,\n\nso d\u2081 +d\u2082 = floor(s\u00b2 /b) + (s\u00b2 modb) = s\u00b2 /b rounded down plus remainder, which is exactly s\u00b2 /b (if fractional part is discarded) plus the remainder gives s\u00b2. But no, the sum d\u2081 +d\u2082 is s, not s\u00b2.\n\nWait, important: d\u2081 +d\u2082 = s,\n\nbut n =s\u00b2 =d\u2081*b +d\u2082.\n\nThus, substituting d\u2082 =s -d\u2081,\n\nso s\u00b2 =d\u2081*b + s -d\u2081 \u21d2s\u00b2 -s =d\u2081*(b-1).\n\nThus, d\u2081=(s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1).\n\nSince d\u2081 must be an integer between1 and b-1,\n\nthen (b-1) divides (s\u00b2 -s),\n\nand 1 \u2264(s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1) \u2264b-1.\n\nThe second inequality gives s\u00b2 -s \u2264(b-1)^2.\n\nSo s\u00b2 -s - (b-1)^2 \u22640.\n\nThis quadratic in s:\n\ns\u00b2 -s - (b\u00b2 -2b +1) \u22640 \u21d2s\u00b2 -s -b\u00b2 +2b -1 \u22640.\n\nThis quadratic equation's roots can be found:\n\ns = [1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +4(b\u00b2 -2b +1))]/2.\n\nBut perhaps it's not useful.\n\nAlternatively, for a given b, possible s range from ceil(\u221ab) up to b-1.\n\nThe number of s in this range where (s\u00b2 -s) is divisible by (b-1).\n\nTo find b where this count exceeds10.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to iterate b and count.\n\nLet me try to compute for increasing b until I find one with count>10.\n\nStart with b=2:\n\nb=2:\n\nk=1 (b-1=1).\n\nNeed s in [2,1], which is empty. So count0.\n\nb=3:\n\nk=2.\n\nPossible s from2 (ceil(sqrt(3))=2 to 2 (since b-1=2).\n\nSo s=2.\n\nCheck if (2\u00b2-2)/2 = (4-2)/2=1. So d\u2081=1,\n\nd\u2082=2-1=1,\n\nn= s\u00b2=4.

For example, bases like 2520 (highly composite), but that's too big. Let me think of b= 121 (k=120).\n\nBut this might take forever.\n\nWait, let me think of when (b-1) is a factorial number, like 6=3!, 24=4!, etc. For example, b=25 (k=24). We saw earlier count3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when b-1 is a multiple of many small primes.\n\nWait let's try k= 240 (b=241). It has factors 2^4*3*5. So \u03c9=3 (primes2,3,5). Solutions mod240 are8.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(241))\u224816.\n\nThus solutions mod240 between16 and240. Assuming half the solutions are above, so4.\n\nStill low.\n\nAlternatively, let's try k= 360 (b=361):\n\nFactors 2^3*3^2*5, so \u03c9=3 (primes2,3,5). Solutions mod360 are8. Thus count around4.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, k= 840 (b=841):\n\nFactors 2^3*3*5*7, so \u03c9=4. Solutions mod840 are16. Lower bound ceil(sqrt(841))=29.\n\nThus about 8 solutions. Still low.\n\nAlternatively, k= 2520 (b=2521):\n\n\u03c9=4 (primes2,3,5,7). Solutions mod2520 are16. Lower bound ceil(sqrt(2521))\u224850. Perhaps 8 solutions.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 100. Let me try b= 100 (k=99).\n\nk=99 factors 9*11, so \u03c9=2 (3 and11). Thus solutions mod99 are4.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(100))=10.\n\nThus solutions mod99 between10 and99: some of the four solutions.\n\nBut count would be low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 210 (k=209). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps k= 120 (b=121):\n\nFactors 2^3*3*5. \u03c9=3. Solutions mod120 are8. Lower bound 11.\n\nThus possible4 solutions.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider when (b-1) has many divisors, allowing more solutions.\n\nWait, notice that for each divisor m of (s\u00b2 -s), we have a possible b= m+1. Thus, if s(s-1) has many divisors, then there are many b's for that s.\n\nBut the question is for a particular b, how many s's satisfy the condition.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of s as varying and see for which b's they contribute.\n\nWait, the problem requires the number of b-beautiful numbers for a given b, which depends on how many s's satisfy the conditions.\n\nPerhaps when b-1 is 120 (highly composite), let me try b= 121 (k=120):\n\n\u03c9(k)=3 (2,3,5), so 8 solutions mod120.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(121))=11.\n\nThus, residues mod120 between11 and120. Assuming half are above, say4 solutions.\n\nStill low.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of when b-1 is a triangular number or something, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 121 where count is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, let's try b= 121 (k=120):\n\nCompute the number of valid s:\n\nPossible s from11 to120.\n\nThe solutions mod120 are 8.\n\nThe residues mod120 that are solutions are combinations of 0/1 mod2,3,5.\n\nLet me find the residues:\n\nMod2: s\u22610 or1,\n\nMod3: s\u22610 or1,\n\nMod5: s\u22610 or1.\n\nThus, the eight residues mod120 are:\n\n0 mod lcm(2,3,5)=30 \u21d2 residues like0 mod120,\n\nBut need to compute all:\n\nCase1: s\u22610 mod2,0 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d20 mod30 \u21d20 mod120,\n\nCase2:0 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d20 mod6,1 mod5 \u21d2s=6a\u22611 mod5 \u21d26a\u22611 \u21d2a\u22611 mod5 \u21d2a=5b+1 \u21d2s=30b +6 \u21d26 mod30,\n\nCase3:0 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d20 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d2s=10 mod30,\n\nCase4:0 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d20 mod2,1 mod15 \u21d2s=16 mod30,\n\nCase5:1 mod2,0 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d2s=15 mod30,\n\nCase6:1 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d2s=21 mod30,\n\nCase7:1 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d2s=5 mod30,\n\nCase8:1 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d21 mod30.\n\nThus residues mod30 are0,5,6,10,15,16,21,30.\n\nThus mod120, these repeat every 30.\n\nThus residues mod120 are:\n\n0,5,6,10,15,16,21,30,\n\n30+5=35,30+6=36,\u2026 up to 90, etc.\n\nBut listing all mod120 residues between1-120:\n\nThe residues are every 30:\n\nStarting with 0 mod30 \u21d20,30,60,90,120,\n\n5 mod30 \u21d25,35,65,95,\n\n6 mod30 \u21d26,36,66,96,\n\n10 mod30 \u21d210,40,70,100,\n\n15 mod30 \u21d215,45,75,105,\n\n16 mod30 \u21d216,46,76,106,\n\n21 mod30 \u21d221,51,81,111,\n\n30 mod30 \u21d230,60,90,120.\n\nThus total residues mod120 are 8 residues per 30, totaling8\u00d74=32 residues, but mod120 there are8 residues.\n\nWait no, mod120 has residues from0-119.\n\nThe solutions mod120 are residues that are congruent to one of the 8 mod30 residues:\n\n0,5,6,10,15,16,21,30 mod30.\n\nThus mod120:\n\nEach of these 8 residues mod30 generates 4 residues mod120 (since 120/30=4).\n\nThus total solutions mod120 are8\u00d74=32? No, no, each residue mod30 corresponds to a residue mod120. Wait mod120 has 120 residues. The solutions are the numbers congruent to the 8 residues mod30. Thus total solutions mod120 are8\u00d7 (120/30)=32? No, it's 8 residues mod30 \u21d2 each corresponds to 4 residues mod120 (since 120/30=4). So total solutions mod120 are8\u00d74=32. Wait no, actually mod30 has 30 residues, and mod120 has four times as many, so each residue mod30 corresponds to four residues mod120. Thus total solutions mod120 are8\u00d74=32.\n\nBut that can't be, since the equation s(s-1)\u22610 mod120 has solutions every 2,3,5 factors, so the number should be 2^3=8 mod120.\n\nWait I'm confused.\n\nActually, the number of solutions mod120 is 2^3=8, since \u03c9(k)=3.\n\nThus the residues mod120 are the 8 combinations of 0/1 mod2,3,5.\n\nThus, the residues mod120 are:\n\n0 mod2,0 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d20 mod30 \u21d20, 30, 60, 90 mod120,\n\n0 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d26 mod30 \u21d26,36,66,96 mod120,\n\n0 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d210 mod30 \u21d210,40,70,100 mod120,\n\n0 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d216 mod30 \u21d216,46,76,106 mod120,\n\n1 mod2,0 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d215 mod30 \u21d215,45,75,105 mod120,\n\n1 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d221 mod30 \u21d221,51,81,111 mod120,\n\n1 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d25 mod30 \u21d25,35,65,95 mod120,\n\n1 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d21 mod30 \u21d21,31,61,91 mod120.\n\nThus total solutions mod120 are residues: 0,1,5,6,10,15,16,21,30,31,35,36,40,45,46,51,60,61,65,66,70,75,76,81,90,91,95,96,100,105,106,111 mod120. Wait, that's 32 residues. Hmm, but according to the earlier logic, it should be 8 solutions mod120. This is conflicting.\n\nWait no, actually, the equation s(s-1)\u22610 mod120 requires that for each prime power dividing 120 (2^3,3,5), the congruence holds mod2^3, mod3, mod5.\n\nThus, for each prime power, the solutions are s\u22610 or1 mod2^3, mod3, mod5.\n\nThus, the total number of solutions mod120 is 2 (for mod8) \u00d72 (mod3) \u00d72 (mod5)=8 solutions.\n\nThus, the solutions mod120 are the combinations of:\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod8,\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, total 8 residues mod120.\n\nAh! So I made a mistake earlier considering mod30. It should be mod8, mod3, mod5.\n\nTherefore, the solutions mod120 are combinations of:\n\nChoose for each prime power:\n\nmod8: s\u22610 or1,\n\nmod3: s\u22610 or1,\n\nmod5: s\u22610 or1,\n\nThus 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 residues mod120.\n\nTherefore, to compute the residues mod120, let's proceed.\n\nCase1:\n\ns\u22610 mod8,\n\ns\u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 mod5 \u21d2s\u22610 mod lcm(8,3,5)=120 \u21d20 mod120.\n\nCase2:\n\ns\u22610 mod8,\n\ns\u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5 \u21d2s\u22610 mod24, s\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet s=24a \u22611 mod5 \u21d224a\u22611 mod5 \u21d224\u22614 mod5 \u21d24a\u22611 \u21d2a\u22614^{-1}=4 mod5 (since4*4=16\u22611 mod5).

Let me think of another approach.\n\nLet me consider that for each s, the number of bases b where s\u00b2 is b-beautiful is equal to the number of divisors m of s(s-1) such that b=m+1 is between s and s\u00b2.\n\nThus, the total count for a given b is the number of s such that s(s-1) is divisible by b-1 and the other conditions hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximal count occurs when b-1 has many small divisors.\n\nLet me think of b-1= 240, which has many factors.\n\nb=241, k=240 (\u03c9=3:2,3,5). Solutions mod240 are8.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(241))=16.\n\nThe residues are similar to the mod120 case but with more factors.\n\nWait, for k=240 (b=241):\n\nThe solutions mod240 are combinations of mod16 (since2^4), mod3, mod5.\n\nThus, 2 (mod16 choices:0/1) \u00d72 (mod3) \u00d72 (mod5) =8 solutions.\n\nThe residues mod240 will be more, but the count between16 and240 may be4.\n\nStill low.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider s=12:\n\nFor any b where 12\u00b2=144 is a two-digit number, so b \u2264144 <b\u00b2 \u21d2b \u2264144 and b>12.\n\nThus b from13 to12.\n\nWait, b must satisfy b \u2264144 and b> sqrt(144)=12 \u21d2b from13 to144.\n\nFor each such b, check if the two digits of 144 in base b sum to12.\n\nThe digits are d\u2081=floor(144/b), d\u2082=144 modb.\n\nThus d\u2081 +d\u2082=12 \u21d2d\u2081 + (144 -d\u2081*b)=12 \u21d2144 -d\u2081*(b-1)=12 \u21d2d\u2081*(b-1)=132.\n\nThus d\u2081 must divide132 and b= (132/d\u2081)+1.\n\nAlso, since d\u2081=floor(144/b), which is also 132/(b-1).\n\nBut d\u2081 must be between1 and b-1.\n\nThus, for each divisor d of132, compute b= (132/d)+1, and check if floor(144/b)=d.\n\nFor example:\n\nDivisors of132:1,2,3,4,6,11,12,22,33,44,66,132.\n\nThus possible b's:\n\nFor d=1: b=133,\n\nCheck floor(144/133)=1 (since144/133\u22481.08 \u21d21). Valid.\n\nThus s=12 is 133-beautiful.\n\nd=2: b=67,\n\nfloor(144/67)=2 (144/67\u22482.14 \u21d22). Valid.\n\nd=3: b=45,\n\nfloor(144/45)=3.2 \u21923. Valid.\n\nd=4: b=34,\n\nfloor(144/34)=4.23 \u21d24. Valid.\n\nd=6: b=23,\n\nfloor(144/23)=6.26 \u21d26. Valid.\n\nd=11: b=13,\n\nfloor(144/13)=11.07 \u21d211. Valid.\n\nd=12: b=12,\n\nBut b must be >12, since s=12 requires b>12 (since n=144 must be two-digit, so b<=144 and b> sqrt(144)=12 \u21d2b\u226513. Thus d=12 gives b=12 which is invalid.\n\nd=22: b=7,\n\nBut b must be >12. So invalid.\n\nSimilarly, larger divisors give b \u226413.2, etc. Thus only valid divisors up to d=11.\n\nThus s=12 contributes to bases:133,67,45,34,23,13. Total6 bases.\n\nSo s=12 contributes6 bases.\n\nSimilarly, other s's like s=11,10,\u2026 can contribute to multiple bases.\n\nThus, to find b where many s's contribute.\n\nPerhaps the minimal b where multiple s's contribute.\n\nFor example, b=24 (k=23). Let's see which s's contribute:\n\ns must satisfy (s\u00b2 -s) divisible by23.\n\nThus s(s-1)\u22610 mod23 \u21d2s\u22610 or1 mod23.\n\nThus s=1 or24, but since s must be between ceil(sqrt(24))=5 and23.\n\nThus s=23 or1. s=23:\n\nd\u2081=(529-23)/23=506/23=22,\n\nd\u2082=23-22=1 \u21d222+1=23. n=529 base24:22*24 +1=529. Valid.\n\ns=1 is invalid.\n\nThus only s=23 for b=24.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of b= 2520 (k=2519). Probably too big.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 242 (k=241), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is 210, but I need to find the first b where count exceeds10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that when b-1 is a factorial number.\n\nLet me try b= 121 (k=120) with count7.\n\nNext, b= 252 (k=251). Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of s=11:\n\nThe number of bases where 121 is two-digit and digits sum to11.\n\nSimilarly, the digits d\u2081=floor(121/b),d\u2082=121 modb.\n\nd\u2081 +d\u2082=11 \u21d2121 modb + floor(121/b)=11 \u21d2121 modb =11 - floor(121/b).\n\nThis is complex.\n\nAlternatively, the problem requires the answer to be the least b with more than ten b-beautiful numbers. After trying up to b=121 with count7, maybe the first b with count=11 is around b= 240 or higher.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of s from1 to b-1, and for each s, the number of bases is roughly the number of divisors of s(s-1).\n\nThus, the total count for a base b is the number of s where b-1 divides s(s-1) and other conditions.\n\nThus, to maximize this count, we need b-1 to divide as many s(s-1) as possible for s in [ceil(sqrt(b)),b-1].\n\nTherefore, the best b-1 is a number with many divisors, so highly composite numbers.\n\nThe first highly composite number beyond 120 is 180 (factors:2^2*3^2*5), \u03c9=3.\n\nLet me try b= 181 (k=180):\n\n\u03c9=3 (2,3,5). Solutions mod180 are8.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(181))=14.\n\nThus residues mod180 between14 and180.\n\nAssuming half, count4.\n\nStill low.\n\nNext highly composite number is 240 (k=240, b=241). We did that earlier.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of b= 105 (k=104).\n\nFactors 8*13. \u03c9=2 (2,13). Solutions mod104 are4.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(105))=11.\n\nCount could be2.\n\nHmm.\n\nThis is taking too long. Given the time I've spent and lack of progress, perhaps the answer is 210 or 240, but I need to make an educated guess.\n\nAlternatively, returning to the example, when b=13 has3 numbers, maybe the count increases as b increases with more factors.\n\nWait, let me try b= 210 (k=209). 209 is 11*19, \u03c9=2. Solutions mod209 are4.\n\nThus count2.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 128 (k=127, prime). Solutions mod127 are2 (0 and1 mod127). Thus count1.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps the minimal b is 242 (k=241). No.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 210, but I think I need to find another way.\n\nWait, notice that in the problem statement, the example is b=13 has one b-beautiful number (81) and another (144). Wait, actually in the example, they said 81 is 13-beautiful, but s=9. Also s=12 would give144 which is valid. So total of two solutions (s=9 and12). But in my earlier calculation for b=13 (k=12), the solutions are s=4,9,12. So three solutions. Thus count3.\n\nSo, the count increases as bases have more factors.\n\nThe next base with higher counts might be when k= b-1 has \u03c9=4, so four prime factors.\n\nLet me try k= 210 (b=211):\n\n\u03c9=4 (2,3,5,7). Solutions mod210 are16.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(211))=15.\n\nThus residues mod210 between15-210.\n\nAssuming half of 16 are above, count8.\n\nStill low.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to try b= 240 (k=239, prime). Count1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe b= 360 (k=359, prime). Count1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 127 (k=126). Let me try b=127:\n\nk=126=2*3^2*7, \u03c9=3.\n\nSolutions mod126 are8.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(127))=12.\n\nThus residues mod126 between12-126.\n\nAssuming half, count4.\n\nHmm.\n\nPerhaps after trying up to b= 240, the first b where count exceeds10 is 240 or 2520.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 210, but I can't verify.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 210, but I need to think differently.\n\nWait let's consider that for a given b, the number of solutions is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s(s-1) divisible by b-1.\n\nThus, for each divisor m of (b-1), the equation s(s-1) \u22610 mod m has solutions s=0 or1 mod each prime factor.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider b-1= 120 (b=121) gives count7,\n\nb-1= 240 (b=241) count8,\n\nb-1= 360 (b=361) count8,\n\nb-1= 840 (b=841) count16/2=8.\n\nWait no, for b-1=840 (\u03c9=4), solutions mod840 are16.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(841))=29,\n\nThus residues mod840 between29 and840,\n\nAssuming half of16 are above, count8.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, if b-1= 2520 (\u03c9=4), solutions mod2520 are16,\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(2521))=51,\n\nThus maybe 8 solutions.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first b where count exceeds10 is when b-1 is a factorial like 720 (b=721):\n\nk=720 (\u03c9=4:2,3,5). Solutions mod720 are8. Count4.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 240.\n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 210 (k=209):\n\n209=11\u00d719, so two prime factors.\n\nSolutions mod209 are4.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(210))=15.\n\nResidues mod209 between15-209.\n\nAssuming two solutions, count2.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm. Since I can't find any b with count>10 up to 240, perhaps the answer is 210 or higher.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in previous calculations and there is a lower b.\n\nWait let me try b= 36 (k=35).

Valid.\n\nThus only s=99 \u21d2 count1.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm, I think I need to consider that maybe the minimal b is 210 or higher, but without further progress, I'll try to think differently.\n\nThe problem requires more than ten b-beautiful numbers.\n\nEach b-beautiful number corresponds to a pair (d\u2081, d\u2082) where d\u2081 +d\u2082 = sqrt(d\u2081*b +d\u2082).\n\nRewriting:\n\nLet s = d\u2081 +d\u2082,\n\nthen s\u00b2 =d\u2081*b +d\u2082 =d\u2081*b + (s -d\u2081),\n\nso s\u00b2 =d\u2081*(b-1) +s,\n\nthen d\u2081=(s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1).\n\nSince d\u2081 must be an integer between1 andb-1,\n\nthen (b-1) divides s\u00b2 -s,\n\nand 1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1) \u2264b-1 \u21d2 s\u00b2 -s \u2264 (b-1)^2.\n\nThus for given b, the possible s must satisfy:\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264s <b,\n\nand s(s-1) divisible by (b-1).\n\nTo maximize the number of s's, b-1 should be a number with many divisors, so that s(s-1) hits many divisors.\n\nThe number of solutions is the number of s in [sqrt(b),b) such that s(s-1) divisible by (b-1).\n\nThus, to maximize, set b-1 to be a number that divides many s(s-1) terms.\n\nThe best case is when b-1 is 1, but then b=2, only one s.\n\nAlternatively, b-1 is a factorial number, which has many factors.\n\nThe smallest factorial number with enough factors to give over ten divisors is 720 (6!),\n\nbut let's see:\n\nb=721 (k=720).\n\n\u03c9=4 (2,3,5).

Solutions mod239 are2 \u21d2 count1.\n\nHmm.\n\nHmm.\n\nWait, let me consider that for b= 210:\n\nWait, perhaps the number of solutions is more than I thought.\n\nWait, k=209 has factors 11 and19.\n\nSolutions mod209 are residues0,1 mod11 and mod19.\n\nThus four residues mod209.\n\nBetween15 and209: two solutions (133 and209).\n\nThus count2.\n\nHmm.\n\nAfter extensive consideration and not finding a better approach, I think the problem requires recognizing that for b-1 being a factorial number like 120 (b=121), but even that gives count7.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in my earlier calculations.\n\nWait let me consider s=12:\n\nIt contributes to bases like13,23,34,45,67,133.\n\nThus for each of these bases, s=12 is a solution.\n\nThus, for example, b=13 has s=12 contributing, but also others like s=9,4, etc.\n\nThus, the total count for a base is the number of s's where b-1 divides s(s-1).\n\nThus, the maximum count would be when b-1 is a number that divides many s(s-1) terms.\n\nThe best such number is 24, which divides numbers like s=8,9,16, etc.\n\nWait for b=25 (k=24):\n\ns=4,9,16,24 \u21d2 count3.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, the minimal b is 210.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 240.\n\nAlternatively, I think the problem's example uses b=13 with3 solutions. To get over10, b needs to be such that b-1 has many factors.\n\nThe first b where the number of divisors of b-1 is sufficient to give over10 solutions is when b-1 has at least11 divisors.\n\nThe smallest number with 12 divisors is 60 (60 has 12 divisors).\n\nThus, b=61 (k=60).\n\nLet me compute for b=61 (k=60):\n\n\u03c9=3 (2,3,5). Solutions mod60 are8.\n\nLower bound ceil(sqrt(61))=8.\n\nThus residues mod60 between8-60.\n\nThe solutions mod60 are residues:\n\n0 mod2,0 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d20 mod60,\n\n0 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d20 mod6,1 mod5 \u21d26 mod30 \u21d26 mod60,\n\n0 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d210 mod30 \u21d210 mod60,\n\n0 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d216 mod30 \u21d216 mod60,\n\n1 mod2,0 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d215 mod30 \u21d215 mod60,\n\n1 mod2,0 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d221 mod30 \u21d221 mod60,\n\n1 mod2,1 mod3,0 mod5 \u21d25 mod30 \u21d25 mod60,\n\n1 mod2,1 mod3,1 mod5 \u21d21 mod30 \u21d21 mod60.\n\nThus residues mod60 are:0,1,5,6,10,15,16,21 mod60.\n\nBetween8 and60:\n\n1 is below8,\n\nThus residues5 mod60 (5<8?), no,\n\n6 mod60 (6), no,\n\n10 mod60 \u21d210,\n\n15,16,21 mod60,\n\n60 mod60 \u21d260.\n\nThus residues10,15,16,21,60.\n\nThus five solutions.\n\nCheck each:\n\ns=10:\n\nd\u2081=(100-10)/60=90/60=1.5 \u21d2invalid.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait for b=61 (k=60):\n\ns must be in [8,60].\n\nFor each residue:\n\ns=10:\n\nd\u2081=(100-10)/60=90/60=1.5 \u21d2 no.\n\ns=15:\n\nd\u2081=(225-15)/60=210/60=3.5 \u21d2 no.\n\ns=16:\n\nd\u2081=(256-16)/60=240/60=4 \u21d2d\u2082=16-4=12 \u21d24+12=16. n=256 base61:4*61+12=244+12=256.
