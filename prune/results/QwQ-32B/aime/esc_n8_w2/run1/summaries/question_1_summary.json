      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this system of logarithmic equations with three variables x, y, and z. The problem gives me three equations involving log base 2 of ratios of these variables, and I need to find the absolute value of another logarithm expression involving x, y, z. Then, express that as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n. Hmm, let's start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n\nSecond equation: log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nAnd the target is |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|. Alright. Since all the equations are logarithms with base 2, maybe converting them into exponential form could help? Or perhaps working with the properties of logarithms to combine them?\n\nLet me recall that log\u2082(A/B) = log\u2082 A - log\u2082 B. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property. Let me try that.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082x - log\u2082(y z) = 1/2. Then log\u2082x - (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, second equation: log\u2082y - log\u2082(x z) = 1/3 \u2192 log\u2082y - (log\u2082x + log\u2082z) = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082z - log\u2082(x y) = 1/4 \u2192 log\u2082z - (log\u2082x + log\u2082y) = 1/4.\n\nHmm, so if I let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z, then these equations can be rewritten in terms of a, b, c. That might make it easier. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Then:\n\nFirst equation becomes: a - (b + c) = 1/2.\n\nSecond equation: b - (a + c) = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: c - (a + b) = 1/4.\n\nSo now we have a system of three linear equations with variables a, b, c. Let me write them out:\n\n1) a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2) -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3) -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, okay, so three equations:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c. Then, once I have those, the expression log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) can be written in terms of a, b, c as 4a + 3b + 2c, right? Because log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z = 4a + 3b + 2c. Then take the absolute value of that, and since they are positive real numbers, maybe it's already positive? Not sure yet, but let's see.\n\nFirst, solving the system of equations. Let's see. Let me write them again:\n\n1) a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2) -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3) -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, perhaps adding equations can help. Let me try adding equations 1 and 2 first:\n\nAdding equation 1 and 2:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = (1/2 + 1/3)\n\nSimplify left side: a - a cancels, -b + b cancels, -c - c = -2c. So -2c = 5/6 \u2192 c = -5/12? Wait, but c is log base 2 of z, which is a positive real number. Wait, but log can be negative if z is between 0 and 1. Since z is positive, that's okay. So maybe okay.\n\nWait, let's check that again. Let me compute the right-hand side:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 is (3/6 + 2/6) = 5/6. So yes, -2c = 5/6 \u21d2 c = -5/12. Hmm.\n\nSimilarly, let's add equations 1 and 3:\n\nEquation 1 + equation 3:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/4\n\nLeft side: a -a cancels, -b - b = -2b, -c + c cancels. So -2b = 3/4 \u21d2 b = -3/8?\n\nWait, right side: 1/2 + 1/4 = 3/4. So -2b = 3/4 \u21d2 b = -3/8. Hmm.\n\nSimilarly, adding equations 2 and 3:\n\nEquation 2 + equation 3:\n\n(-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLeft side: -a -a = -2a, b - b cancels, -c + c cancels. So -2a = 7/12 \u21d2 a = -7/24?\n\nWait, right side: 1/3 + 1/4 = (4/12 + 3/12) = 7/12. So -2a = 7/12 \u21d2 a = -7/24. Hmm.\n\nWait a second, so according to these additions, we have:\n\nFrom equations 1 + 2: c = -5/12\n\nEquations 1 + 3: b = -3/8\n\nEquations 2 + 3: a = -7/24\n\nWait, but let's check if these values satisfy the original equations. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let me note the values:\n\na = -7/24,\n\nb = -3/8,\n\nc = -5/12.\n\nLet me plug into equation 1: a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term: -7/24 + 3/8 +5/12\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/24 + 9/24 + 10/24 = (-7 + 9 + 10)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2. That works.\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 7/24 - 3/8 +5/12\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n7/24 - 9/24 +10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3. That's correct.\n\nEquation 3: -a -b +c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = 7/24 + 3/8 -5/12\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n7/24 +9/24 -10/24 = (7+9-10)/24 =6/24 =1/4. Correct. Okay, so that works. So the values are a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082x = a = -7/24, so x = 2^{-7/24}\n\nSimilarly, y = 2^{-3/8}, z = 2^{-5/12}\n\nBut the problem asks for log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). Let's compute that expression:\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z = 4a +3b +2c.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n4*(-7/24) +3*(-3/8) +2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6\n\nAdding them together: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nFirst, combine the terms with denominator 6: (-7/6 -5/6) = -12/6 = -2\n\nThen add -9/8: -2 - 9/8 = - (16/8 +9/8) = -25/8\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -25/8. Since we need the absolute value, | -25/8 | =25/8. So m=25, n=8, which are coprime. Therefore m +n= 33. Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure.\n\nWait, let me recalculate 4a +3b +2c step by step:\n\na is -7/24, so 4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\nb is -3/8, so 3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\nc is -5/12, so 2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6\n\nAdding them:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, combine the -7/6 and -5/6: that's -12/6 = -2. Then, -2 -9/8. Converting -2 to eighths: -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8. Yes, that's right. So absolute value is 25/8, so m + n is 25 +8 =33.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I made any mistake in the solving of the equations.\n\nWe had three equations:\n\n1) a - b - c =1/2\n\n2) -a + b -c =1/3\n\n3) -a -b +c =1/4\n\nWe solved by adding equations 1 and 2 to eliminate a and b?\n\nWait, actually when adding equations 1 and 2, the variables a and b cancel partially?\n\nWait, equation 1: a - b -c = 1/2\n\nequation 2: -a + b -c =1/3\n\nAdding them: (a -a) + (-b +b) + (-c -c) = (1/2 +1/3)\n\nSo that gives 0 +0 -2c =5/6 \u21d2 c = -5/12. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, adding equations 1 and 3:\n\nequation1 + equation3: (a -a) + (-b -b) + (-c +c) = 1/2 +1/4\n\nSo 0 -2b +0 = 3/4 \u21d2 -2b = 3/4 \u21d2 b= -3/8. Correct.\n\nAdding equations 2 and3:\n\nequation2 + equation3: (-a -a) + (b -b) + (-c +c) =1/3 +1/4\n\nSo -2a +0 +0 =7/12 \u21d2 -2a=7/12 \u21d2a= -7/24. Correct.\n\nSo all steps are correct. So the values of a, b, c are correct. Then the calculation of 4a +3b +2c is correct. So the absolute value is 25/8, so m +n is 33. So the answer is 33. Wait, but let me just confirm once again the question says \"the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)| is m/n... Find m +n\". So since the absolute value is 25/8, that fraction is reduced, since 25 and 8 have no common factors. So yes, m=25, n=8, so 33. So I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n",

Hmm, let's start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n\nSecond equation: log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nAnd the target is |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|. Alright. Since all the equations are logarithms with base 2, maybe converting them into exponential form could help? Or perhaps working with the properties of logarithms to combine them?\n\nLet me recall that log\u2082(A/B) = log\u2082 A - log\u2082 B. So maybe I can rewrite each equation using that property. Let me try that.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082x - log\u2082(y z) = 1/2. Then log\u2082x - (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, second equation: log\u2082y - log\u2082(x z) = 1/3 \u2192 log\u2082y - (log\u2082x + log\u2082z) = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082z - log\u2082(x y) = 1/4 \u2192 log\u2082z - (log\u2082x + log\u2082y) = 1/4.\n\nHmm, so if I let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z, then these equations can be rewritten in terms of a, b, c. That might make it easier. Let me try that substitution.\n\nLet a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Then:\n\nFirst equation becomes: a - (b + c) = 1/2.\n\nSecond equation: b - (a + c) = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: c - (a + b) = 1/4.\n\nSo now we have a system of three linear equations with variables a, b, c. Let me write them out:\n\n1) a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2) -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3) -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, okay, so three equations:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nI need to solve for a, b, c. Then, once I have those, the expression log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) can be written in terms of a, b, c as 4a + 3b + 2c, right? Because log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z = 4a + 3b + 2c. Then take the absolute value of that, and since they are positive real numbers, maybe it's already positive? Not sure yet, but let's see.\n\nFirst, solving the system of equations. Let's see. Let me write them again:\n\n1) a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2) -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3) -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, perhaps adding equations can help. Let me try adding equations 1 and 2 first:\n\nAdding equation 1 and 2:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = (1/2 + 1/3)\n\nSimplify left side: a - a cancels, -b + b cancels, -c - c = -2c. So -2c = 5/6 \u2192 c = -5/12? Wait, but c is log base 2 of z, which is a positive real number. Wait, but log can be negative if z is between 0 and 1. Since z is positive, that's okay. So maybe okay.\n\nWait, let's check that again. Let me compute the right-hand side:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 is (3/6 + 2/6) = 5/6. So yes, -2c = 5/6 \u21d2 c = -5/12. Hmm.\n\nSimilarly, let's add equations 1 and 3:\n\nEquation 1 + equation 3:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/2 + 1/4\n\nLeft side: a -a cancels, -b - b = -2b, -c + c cancels.

Hmm.\n\nSimilarly, adding equations 2 and 3:\n\nEquation 2 + equation 3:\n\n(-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLeft side: -a -a = -2a, b - b cancels, -c + c cancels. So -2a = 7/12 \u21d2 a = -7/24?\n\nWait, right side: 1/3 + 1/4 = (4/12 + 3/12) = 7/12. So -2a = 7/12 \u21d2 a = -7/24. Hmm.\n\nWait a second, so according to these additions, we have:\n\nFrom equations 1 + 2: c = -5/12\n\nEquations 1 + 3: b = -3/8\n\nEquations 2 + 3: a = -7/24\n\nWait, but let's check if these values satisfy the original equations. Let's see.\n\nFirst, let me note the values:\n\na = -7/24,\n\nb = -3/8,\n\nc = -5/12.\n\nLet me plug into equation 1: a - b - c = (-7/24) - (-3/8) - (-5/12)\n\nCompute each term: -7/24 + 3/8 +5/12\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n-7/24 + 9/24 + 10/24 = (-7 + 9 + 10)/24 = 12/24 = 1/2. That works.\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = -(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12) = 7/24 - 3/8 +5/12\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n7/24 - 9/24 +10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3. That's correct.\n\nEquation 3: -a -b +c = -(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = 7/24 + 3/8 -5/12\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n7/24 +9/24 -10/24 = (7+9-10)/24 =6/24 =1/4. Correct. Okay, so that works. So the values are a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082x = a = -7/24, so x = 2^{-7/24}\n\nSimilarly, y = 2^{-3/8}, z = 2^{-5/12}\n\nBut the problem asks for log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). Let's compute that expression:\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z = 4a +3b +2c.\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n4*(-7/24) +3*(-3/8) +2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\n3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\n2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6\n\nAdding them together: (-7/6) + (-9/8) + (-5/6)\n\nFirst, combine the terms with denominator 6: (-7/6 -5/6) = -12/6 = -2\n\nThen add -9/8: -2 - 9/8 = - (16/8 +9/8) = -25/8\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -25/8. Since we need the absolute value, | -25/8 | =25/8. So m=25, n=8, which are coprime. Therefore m +n= 33. Wait, but let me check my calculations again to make sure.\n\nWait, let me recalculate 4a +3b +2c step by step:\n\na is -7/24, so 4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6\n\nb is -3/8, so 3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8\n\nc is -5/12, so 2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6\n\nAdding them:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, combine the -7/6 and -5/6: that's -12/6 = -2. Then, -2 -9/8. Converting -2 to eighths: -16/8 -9/8 = -25/8. Yes, that's right. So absolute value is 25/8, so m + n is 25 +8 =33.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if I made any mistake in the solving of the equations.\n\nWe had three equations:\n\n1) a - b - c =1/2\n\n2) -a + b -c =1/3\n\n3) -a -b +c =1/4\n\nWe solved by adding equations 1 and 2 to eliminate a and b?\n\nWait, actually when adding equations 1 and 2, the variables a and b cancel partially?\n\nWait, equation 1: a - b -c = 1/2\n\nequation 2: -a + b -c =1/3\n\nAdding them: (a -a) + (-b +b) + (-c -c) = (1/2 +1/3)\n\nSo that gives 0 +0 -2c =5/6 \u21d2 c = -5/12. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, adding equations 1 and 3:\n\nequation1 + equation3: (a -a) + (-b -b) + (-c +c) = 1/2 +1/4\n\nSo 0 -2b +0 = 3/4 \u21d2 -2b = 3/4 \u21d2 b= -3/8. Correct.\n\nAdding equations 2 and3:\n\nequation2 + equation3: (-a -a) + (b -b) + (-c +c) =1/3 +1/4\n\nSo -2a +0 +0 =7/12 \u21d2 -2a=7/12 \u21d2a= -7/24. Correct.\n\nSo all steps are correct. So the values of a, b, c are correct. Then the calculation of 4a +3b +2c is correct. So the absolute value is 25/8, so m +n is 33. So the answer is 33. Wait, but let me just confirm once again the question says \"the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)| is m/n... Find m +n\". So since the absolute value is 25/8, that fraction is reduced, since 25 and 8 have no common factors. So yes, m=25, n=8, so 33. So I think that's right. I don't see any mistakes here.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n\n\nGiven the system of equations involving logarithms:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nWe introduce variables \\(a = \\log_2 x\\), \\(b = \\log_2 y\\), and \\(c = \\log_2 z\\).

So, we have three equations with logarithms, and we need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|, then express it as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and finally find m + n. Alright, let me start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right.\n\nThe equations are:\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, since all the equations are logarithms with base 2, maybe converting them into exponential form could help? Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So, applying that here:\n\nFirst equation: 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\nSecond equation: 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\nThird equation: 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nHmm, so we have three equations:\n\n1. x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n2. y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n3. z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, this seems a bit circular. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the others and substitute them? Let me see. Let me denote the equations as (1), (2), (3) for reference.\n\nStarting with equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me plug this expression for x into equation (2). So equation (2) becomes:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (x z) \u2192 substituting x from (1):\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (2^(1/2) * y z) * z\n\nWait, let me check that again. Equation (2) is y = 2^(1/3) * x z. Since x is 2^(1/2)*y z, then substituting gives:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * [2^(1/2) * y z] * z\n\nMultiplying those terms: 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) is 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6). Then, the y z * z is y z\u00b2. So:\n\ny = 2^(5/6) * y z\u00b2\n\nHmm, so we can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so not zero):\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z\u00b2\n\nTherefore, z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6). So z = 2^(-5/12). Wait, but z is positive, so we can take the positive root.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me write that down:\n\nz\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6) \u21d2 z = 2^(-5/12)\n\nWait, but before I proceed, let me check if that's correct. Let me retrace.\n\nStarting from equation (2) substitution:\n\nOriginal equation (2) after substitution:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * x z, with x from equation (1) is 2^(1/2)*y z. So substituting x:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * [2^(1/2)*y z] * z\n\nYes, so inside the brackets is x, which is multiplied by z. So that's correct. Then multiplying the constants: 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6), and variables: y z * z = y z\u00b2. So then, moving y to the other side:\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) z\u00b2 \u21d2 z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive. Okay, that seems okay.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find expressions for other variables. Let me note that down as equation (4): z = 2^(-5/12). Hmm. Maybe proceed similarly to find y and x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better approach. Since all three equations are logarithmic, maybe taking all three equations and manipulating them by adding or subtracting?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider taking the logarithmic equations and express them in terms of log x, log y, log z. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote log\u2082x = a, log\u2082y = b, log\u2082z = c. Then, the equations can be rewritten in terms of a, b, c.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Using logarithm properties: log\u2082x - log\u2082(y z) = 1/2. Then, log\u2082x - (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) = 1/2. So, a - (b + c) = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, second equation: log\u2082(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So log\u2082y - (log\u2082x + log\u2082z) = 1/3. So, b - (a + c) = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So log\u2082z - (log\u2082x + log\u2082y) = 1/4. Thus, c - (a + b) = 1/4.\n\nSo now, we have a system of three linear equations in variables a, b, c:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, this seems more manageable. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nSo, three equations with three variables. Let me write them in standard form:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm. Let me try to solve this system. Let's see, perhaps adding equations to eliminate variables.\n\nFirst, let me add equations 1 and 2:\n\n(1) + (2): (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = 1/2 + 1/3\n\nLeft side: a - a cancels, -b + b cancels, -c -c = -2c.\n\nRight side: (3/6 + 2/6) = 5/6\n\nThus: -2c = 5/6 \u21d2 c = -5/12\n\nWait, that's interesting. So c = -5/12. Let me note that down: c = -5/12.\n\nHmm, okay. Then, perhaps add equations 2 and 3?\n\nEquation 2 + 3: (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLeft side: -a -a = -2a, b - b cancels, -c + c cancels. So total: -2a.\n\nRight side: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12.\n\nSo: -2a = 7/12 \u21d2 a = -7/24\n\nWait, so a is -7/24? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nAdding them:\n\n(-a -a) + (b - b) + (-c + c) = 1/3 + 1/4\n\nWhich is -2a + 0 + 0 = 7/12 \u21d2 -2a = 7/12 \u21d2 a = -7/(24). Yes, that's correct. So a = -7/24.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find b. Let's use equation 1 and substitute a and c.\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nWe have a = -7/24, c = -5/12. Let me plug them in:\n\n(-7/24) - b - (-5/12) = 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n-7/24 - b + 5/12 = 1/2\n\nConvert 5/12 to 10/24:\n\n-7/24 - b + 10/24 = 1/2\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(-7 + 10)/24 - b = 1/2 \u21d2 3/24 - b = 1/2 \u21d2 1/8 - b = 1/2\n\nSubtract 1/8 both sides:\n\n- b = 1/2 - 1/8 = 4/8 - 1/8 = 3/8 \u21d2 b = -3/8\n\nSo b = -3/8.\n\nLet me check with equation 2 to confirm.\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nPlug in a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12:\n\n-(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12) = ?\n\n7/24 - 3/8 + 5/12\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n7/24 - 9/24 + 10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3. Which matches equation 2. Good.\n\nSimilarly check equation 3:\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nPlugging in a, b, c:\n\n-(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = 7/24 + 3/8 -5/12\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the values are:\n\na = log\u2082x = -7/24,\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8,\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|. Let me compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2). Using logarithm properties, that's 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z.\n\nPlugging in the values of a, b, c:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6,\n\n3*(-3/8) = -9/8,\n\n2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6: that's -12/6 = -2.\n\nThen, -2 -9/8. Let's write -2 as -16/8:\n\n-16/8 -9/8 = -25/8.\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -25/8. Then the absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8, and m = 25, n = 8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1. So m + n = 33.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nCompute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nGiven a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nSo:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6 \u2248 -1.1667\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8 \u2248 -1.125\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6 \u2248 -0.8333\n\nAdding them: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24.\n\nAdding those: -28 -27 -20 = -75 over 24. Wait, hold on a second, that's different from before. Wait, did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-express each term with denominator 24:\n\n-7/6 is equal to -28/24,\n\n-9/8 is equal to -27/24,\n\n-5/6 is equal to -20/24.\n\nSo total is (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Because 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So that's -25/8. So that's correct. So my initial calculation was right. So the absolute value is 25/8, so m + n = 25 + 8 = 33. Hmm, okay, so that's correct. Wait, but why did I get confused when converting?\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the sum step by step:\n\nFirst, -7/6 -9/8:\n\nTo add -7/6 and -9/8, common denominator is 24:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\nTotal: -55/24.\n\nThen add -5/6, which is -20/24,\n\nTotal: -55 -20 = -75/24 = -25/8. So yes, same result.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value is 25/8, so m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33.\n\nHmm, seems correct. Let me check if there's another way to approach the problem, just to verify.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the original equations:\n\nWe had expressions for x, y, z in terms of each other, but maybe solving via substitution would have led to the same result?\n\nEarlier, when I started substituting, I found z = 2^(-5/12). Let me see if that aligns with the current result. Since log\u2082 z = c = -5/12, so z = 2^(-5/12). Yes, that matches. Similarly, log\u2082x = a = -7/24 \u21d2 x = 2^(-7/24), and log\u2082y = b = -3/8 \u21d2 y = 2^(-3/8). So that's consistent with the other variables.\n\nIf I compute x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2, that would be:\n\nx\u2074 = [2^(-7/24)]\u2074 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6),\n\ny\u00b3 = [2^(-3/8)]\u00b3 = 2^(-9/8),\n\nz\u00b2 = [2^(-5/12)]\u00b2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6).\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6).\n\nAdding exponents:\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6: -12/6 = -2,\n\nThen add -9/8: -2 -9/8 = -25/8. So exponent is -25/8, so log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) is -25/8, absolute value 25/8. So same result. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 25 + 8 = 33. I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n",

Let me retrace.\n\nStarting from equation (2) substitution:\n\nOriginal equation (2) after substitution:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * x z, with x from equation (1) is 2^(1/2)*y z. So substituting x:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * [2^(1/2)*y z] * z\n\nYes, so inside the brackets is x, which is multiplied by z. So that's correct. Then multiplying the constants: 2^(1/3 + 1/2) = 2^(5/6), and variables: y z * z = y z\u00b2. So then, moving y to the other side:\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) z\u00b2 \u21d2 z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive. Okay, that seems okay.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find expressions for other variables. Let me note that down as equation (4): z = 2^(-5/12). Hmm. Maybe proceed similarly to find y and x?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better approach. Since all three equations are logarithmic, maybe taking all three equations and manipulating them by adding or subtracting?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider taking the logarithmic equations and express them in terms of log x, log y, log z. Let me try that.\n\nLet me denote log\u2082x = a, log\u2082y = b, log\u2082z = c. Then, the equations can be rewritten in terms of a, b, c.\n\nFirst equation: log\u2082(x/(y z)) = 1/2. Using logarithm properties: log\u2082x - log\u2082(y z) = 1/2. Then, log\u2082x - (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) = 1/2. So, a - (b + c) = 1/2.\n\nSimilarly, second equation: log\u2082(y/(x z)) = 1/3. So log\u2082y - (log\u2082x + log\u2082z) = 1/3. So, b - (a + c) = 1/3.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)) = 1/4. So log\u2082z - (log\u2082x + log\u2082y) = 1/4. Thus, c - (a + b) = 1/4.\n\nSo now, we have a system of three linear equations in variables a, b, c:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm, this seems more manageable. Let me write them again:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nSo, three equations with three variables. Let me write them in standard form:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nHmm. Let me try to solve this system. Let's see, perhaps adding equations to eliminate variables.\n\nFirst, let me add equations 1 and 2:\n\n(1) + (2): (a - b - c) + (-a + b - c) = 1/2 + 1/3\n\nLeft side: a - a cancels, -b + b cancels, -c -c = -2c.\n\nRight side: (3/6 + 2/6) = 5/6\n\nThus: -2c = 5/6 \u21d2 c = -5/12\n\nWait, that's interesting. So c = -5/12. Let me note that down: c = -5/12.\n\nHmm, okay. Then, perhaps add equations 2 and 3?\n\nEquation 2 + 3: (-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) = 1/3 + 1/4\n\nLeft side: -a -a = -2a, b - b cancels, -c + c cancels. So total: -2a.\n\nRight side: 4/12 + 3/12 = 7/12.\n\nSo: -2a = 7/12 \u21d2 a = -7/24\n\nWait, so a is -7/24? Let me check that again.\n\nWait, equation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nAdding them:\n\n(-a -a) + (b - b) + (-c + c) = 1/3 + 1/4\n\nWhich is -2a + 0 + 0 = 7/12 \u21d2 -2a = 7/12 \u21d2 a = -7/(24). Yes, that's correct. So a = -7/24.\n\nNow, let's see if we can find b. Let's use equation 1 and substitute a and c.\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2\n\nWe have a = -7/24, c = -5/12. Let me plug them in:\n\n(-7/24) - b - (-5/12) = 1/2\n\nSimplify:\n\n-7/24 - b + 5/12 = 1/2\n\nConvert 5/12 to 10/24:\n\n-7/24 - b + 10/24 = 1/2\n\nCombine the fractions:\n\n(-7 + 10)/24 - b = 1/2 \u21d2 3/24 - b = 1/2 \u21d2 1/8 - b = 1/2\n\nSubtract 1/8 both sides:\n\n- b = 1/2 - 1/8 = 4/8 - 1/8 = 3/8 \u21d2 b = -3/8\n\nSo b = -3/8.\n\nLet me check with equation 2 to confirm.\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c = 1/3\n\nPlug in a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12:\n\n-(-7/24) + (-3/8) - (-5/12) = ?\n\n7/24 - 3/8 + 5/12\n\nConvert all to 24 denominators:\n\n7/24 - 9/24 + 10/24 = (7 -9 +10)/24 = 8/24 = 1/3. Which matches equation 2. Good.\n\nSimilarly check equation 3:\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c = 1/4\n\nPlugging in a, b, c:\n\n-(-7/24) - (-3/8) + (-5/12) = 7/24 + 3/8 -5/12\n\nConvert to 24 denominator:\n\n7/24 + 9/24 -10/24 = (7 +9 -10)/24 = 6/24 = 1/4. Correct.\n\nGreat, so the values are:\n\na = log\u2082x = -7/24,\n\nb = log\u2082y = -3/8,\n\nc = log\u2082z = -5/12.\n\nNow, the problem asks for |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)|. Let me compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2). Using logarithm properties, that's 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z.\n\nPlugging in the values of a, b, c:\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12)\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6,\n\n3*(-3/8) = -9/8,\n\n2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-7/6 -9/8 -5/6\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6: that's -12/6 = -2.\n\nThen, -2 -9/8. Let's write -2 as -16/8:\n\n-16/8 -9/8 = -25/8.\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = -25/8. Then the absolute value is | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nSo the value is 25/8, and m = 25, n = 8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1. So m + n = 33.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make an arithmetic mistake. Let me go through the steps again.\n\nCompute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = 4a + 3b + 2c.\n\nGiven a = -7/24, b = -3/8, c = -5/12.\n\nSo:\n\n4a = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24 = -7/6 \u2248 -1.1667\n\n3b = 3*(-3/8) = -9/8 \u2248 -1.125\n\n2c = 2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -5/6 \u2248 -0.8333\n\nAdding them: -7/6 -9/8 -5/6.\n\nLet me convert all to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\n-5/6 = -20/24.\n\nAdding those: -28 -27 -20 = -75 over 24. Wait, hold on a second, that's different from before. Wait, did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me re-express each term with denominator 24:\n\n-7/6 is equal to -28/24,\n\n-9/8 is equal to -27/24,\n\n-5/6 is equal to -20/24.\n\nSo total is (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8. Because 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So that's -25/8. So that's correct. So my initial calculation was right. So the absolute value is 25/8, so m + n = 25 + 8 = 33. Hmm, okay, so that's correct. Wait, but why did I get confused when converting?\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the sum step by step:\n\nFirst, -7/6 -9/8:\n\nTo add -7/6 and -9/8, common denominator is 24:\n\n-7/6 = -28/24,\n\n-9/8 = -27/24,\n\nTotal: -55/24.\n\nThen add -5/6, which is -20/24,\n\nTotal: -55 -20 = -75/24 = -25/8. So yes, same result.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value is 25/8, so m = 25, n = 8, so m + n = 33.\n\nHmm, seems correct. Let me check if there's another way to approach the problem, just to verify.\n\nAlternatively, going back to the original equations:\n\nWe had expressions for x, y, z in terms of each other, but maybe solving via substitution would have led to the same result?\n\nEarlier, when I started substituting, I found z = 2^(-5/12). Let me see if that aligns with the current result. Since log\u2082 z = c = -5/12, so z = 2^(-5/12). Yes, that matches. Similarly, log\u2082x = a = -7/24 \u21d2 x = 2^(-7/24), and log\u2082y = b = -3/8 \u21d2 y = 2^(-3/8). So that's consistent with the other variables.\n\nIf I compute x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2, that would be:\n\nx\u2074 = [2^(-7/24)]\u2074 = 2^(-28/24) = 2^(-7/6),\n\ny\u00b3 = [2^(-3/8)]\u00b3 = 2^(-9/8),\n\nz\u00b2 = [2^(-5/12)]\u00b2 = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6).\n\nMultiplying these together:\n\n2^(-7/6) * 2^(-9/8) * 2^(-5/6) = 2^(-7/6 -9/8 -5/6).\n\nAdding exponents:\n\nFirst, combine -7/6 and -5/6: -12/6 = -2,\n\nThen add -9/8: -2 -9/8 = -25/8. So exponent is -25/8, so log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) is -25/8, absolute value 25/8. So same result. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 25 + 8 = 33. I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n\n\nGiven the system of equations involving logarithms:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nWe convert these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:\n\n1. \\( x = 2^{1/2} \\cdot yz \\)\n2. \\( y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz \\)\n3. \\( z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy \\)\n\nNext, we introduce variables \\( a = \\log_2 x \\), \\( b = \\log_2 y \\), and \\( c = \\log_2 z \\).
