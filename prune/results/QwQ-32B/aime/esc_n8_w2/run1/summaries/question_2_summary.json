      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all line segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. There's a unique point C on segment AB (not A or B) that isn't on any segment from F except AB itself. We have to find OC\u00b2, express it as p/q with p and q coprime, and then find p + q.\n\nHmm. Let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the segment AB is part of this triangle. The family F is all the unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. The point C is special because it's only on AB and none of the other segments in F. So, C is not on any other unit-length segment from the x to y-axis except AB.\n\nFirst, maybe I should parametrize the points on AB. Let me find the equation of line AB. The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). That simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nSo any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) where t is between 0 and 1/2. Wait, since A is at x=1/2 and B is at x=0, so when t goes from 0 to 1/2, x goes from 0 to 1/2, but since AB is from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), actually the parameter t for the x-coordinate should go from 1/2 down to 0? Hmm, maybe better to parametrize with a parameter s from 0 to 1. Let me do that.\n\nLet\u2019s let parameter s go from 0 to 1, where s=0 corresponds to point A and s=1 corresponds to B. Then the coordinates of point C(s) would be:\n\nx-coordinate: 1/2 - (1/2)s (since moving from 1/2 to 0 as s goes from 0 to1)\n\ny-coordinate: 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)s (since moving from 0 to sqrt(3)/2 as s goes from 0 to1)\n\nSo coordinates: ( (1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s )\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a different parameter. But perhaps parametrizing by x-coordinate is okay. Let me see.\n\nNow, the key is that point C is on some segment PQ in F (other than AB) only if it lies on AB. But the problem states that C is not on any segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments in F, C is not on them. So, C is not on any other unit-length segment between the axes except AB.\n\nTherefore, to find such a point C, we need that for any segment PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. But since the problem states that there is a unique such C on AB (other than A and B), so this point must be such that if you try to have a unit segment PQ (with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis) passing through C, the only one possible is AB itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the only point (other than A,B) on AB that is not covered by any other segment in F. So, for any other segment in F, they don't pass through C except AB. Therefore, for any other segment PQ in F (not AB), C is not on PQ. So, we need to find point C on AB so that it's not on any PQ except AB. So, the point C is not on any other unit segment between the axes except AB.\n\nTherefore, to find such a point, perhaps we need that for any other PQ in F, the line PQ doesn't pass through C. Therefore, the point C must lie in such a way that the only unit segment between axes passing through it is AB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the envelope of all these segments PQ. The point C is not on the envelope except AB. Hmm, perhaps another approach is better.\n\nLet me think of parametrizing a general segment PQ in F. Let me denote P as (a,0) on the x-axis and Q as (0,b) on the y-axis, such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So the distance formula gives sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 1. So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1. Since they are in the first quadrant, a and b are non-negative. But since PQ is in the first quadrant, the segment itself is in the first quadrant, so a and b are positive.\n\nSo the segments PQ are all the line segments from (a,0) to (0,b) with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, and a, b >0.\n\nNow, the line PQ can be written as the line connecting (a,0) and (0,b). The equation of this line is x/a + y/b =1.\n\nSo any point (x,y) on PQ must satisfy x/a + y/b =1. \n\nNow, we want to find a point C on AB such that C is not on any such line PQ (except when PQ is AB itself). So, for point C, which is on AB, the coordinates of C must satisfy the equation of AB and also not satisfy x/a + y/b =1 for any a, b with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1 except when PQ is AB.\n\nTherefore, substituting the coordinates of C into x/a + y/b =1 should only be possible when (a,b) corresponds to the points A and B. Wait, but A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the segment AB is PQ with a =1/2 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Let me check: (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 =1, so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the line AB is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2)=1, which simplifies to 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y =1. But maybe that's not necessary.\n\nSo, the point C is on AB, so its coordinates are (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) for some t between 0 and 1/2. We need that for this point (x,y) = (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), the equation x/a + y/b =1 cannot be satisfied by any a and b except a=1/2, b= sqrt(3)/2. \n\nWait, but the problem states that C is not on any segment from F except AB, so for any other PQ in F (i.e., any other a and b with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1 except a=1/2 and b= sqrt(3)/2), the point C should not lie on their line.\n\nTherefore, for the coordinates (t, y(t)), where y(t) = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2, the equation t/a + y(t)/b =1 must have no solutions (a,b) with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1 except (a,b)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nAlternatively, for all other (a,b) with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1, the equation t/a + y(t)/b \u22601.\n\nBut how do we ensure that? Perhaps, for the point C, the system of equations:\n\nt/a + y(t)/b =1,\n\nand a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1,\n\nhas only the solution (a,b)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So we need that the only solution (a,b) to the two equations is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nTherefore, substituting y(t) into the first equation:\n\nt/a + [ -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / b =1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n(t)/a + [ sqrt(3)( (1/2) - t ) ] / b =1.\n\nWe need this equation to hold only when a=1/2 and b= sqrt(3)/2. So, for other a and b on the unit circle, this equation should not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the point C, the equation t/a + y(t)/b =1 has only one solution (a,b) on the unit circle, which is the one corresponding to AB. Therefore, the system of equations must have a unique solution. To ensure that, maybe the point C must lie such that the line PQ (for other a,b) does not pass through it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is the intersection point of AB with some envelope of the family F. The envelope of the family of lines x/a + y/b =1 with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1. Maybe the envelope touches AB at point C, so that C is the only point on AB that is on the envelope. Hmm, that might be a way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for the point C, the line PQ must be tangent to some curve. Wait, perhaps the envelope of all these lines PQ is a curve, and C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to find such a point C, we can set up the equations such that the system of equations has a unique solution (a,b). Let me see.\n\nSuppose we set up the equations:\n\nt/a + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / b =1,\n\nand\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe want that these equations have only one solution (a,b) which is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). To find t such that this system has only that solution, perhaps we can think of this as an equation in a and b, and for the system to have only one solution, the equations must be dependent in some way, or the discriminant of the system is zero.\n\nAlternatively, we can parametrize a and b using trigonometric functions. Since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1, we can set a = cos\u03b8, b = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2 (since a and b are positive). Then the equation becomes:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me denote this equation as:\n\n(t) sec\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) csc\u03b8 =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is complicated, but maybe we can rearrange terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me let\u2019s set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote a = cos\u03b8, b = sin\u03b8. Then the equation becomes:\n\n(t)/cos\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\nt sin\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2 ] cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nt sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) t cos\u03b8 + (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nFactor terms with t:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + (sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 ) = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nHmm, perhaps solving for t?\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nt [ sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ] = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 )\n\nFactor right-hand side:\n\ncos\u03b8 [ sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 ]\n\nTherefore,\n\nt = [ cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / [ sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ]\n\nHmm, that's a complicated expression, but perhaps we can set this equal to t for some \u03b8, and find t such that this equation has only one solution \u03b8 (the one corresponding to AB).\n\nWait, the point C is on AB, so for the specific \u03b8 corresponding to AB, which is when a=1/2 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Let me check what \u03b8 that corresponds to.\n\nSince a = cos\u03b8 =1/2, so \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 (60 degrees). Similarly, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2. So \u03b8= \u03c0/3 is the angle for AB.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that for the given t, the equation above gives \u03b8= \u03c0/3 as the only solution, we need that when we solve for \u03b8, there is only one solution \u03b8= \u03c0/3. To have that, perhaps the equation for \u03b8 must have a double root at \u03b8= \u03c0/3. That is, when we set up the equation for \u03b8, the solution \u03b8= \u03c0/3 is a double root. \n\nAlternatively, maybe when we set up the equation for \u03b8, the numerator and denominator both have a common factor (\u03b8 - \u03c0/3)^2? Hmm, perhaps calculus could help here. Let me think of t as a parameter and set up the equation such that \u03b8= \u03c0/3 is a double root.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is where the envelope of the family of lines PQ touches AB. The envelope of the family of lines x/a + y/b =1 with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2=1 can be found by using the envelope condition. Let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves defined by F(x,y,a,b)=0 with some constraint can be found by solving F=0 and dF/da=0 (or dF/db=0) if the parameters are related. Hmm, but in this case, the parameters a and b are related by a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1. So maybe we can parametrize by a single variable.\n\nLet me try parametrizing with \u03b8 as before, so a=cos\u03b8, b=sin\u03b8. Then the line is x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8, because:\n\nOriginal line equation is x/a + y/b =1, so multiplying both sides by ab gives bx + ay = ab. But since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1, so perhaps another way.\n\nWait, let me re-express the line equation:\n\nx/a + y/b =1.\n\nBut since a and b are related by a\u00b2 + b\u00b2=1, perhaps we can write the envelope equations.\n\nAlternatively, the envelope of the family of lines x/a + y/b =1 with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1 can be found by using the condition for envelope. The envelope is found by solving the equations:\n\nF(x,y,a,b)= x/a + y/b -1 =0,\n\nand\n\ndF/da = -x/a\u00b2 - 0 +0 =0,\n\ndF/db = -y/b\u00b2 -0 +0=0,\n\nbut also considering the constraint a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1.\n\nWait, maybe better to parametrize with one variable. Let me use \u03b8 where a=cos\u03b8, b=sin\u03b8. Then the line equation becomes x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nOriginal equation x/a + y/b =1, substituting a=cos\u03b8, b=sin\u03b8,\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nx sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nSo, x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nYes, that's the equation. \n\nSo the envelope of these lines can be found by differentiating with respect to \u03b8 and setting the derivative to zero.\n\nLet me denote F(x,y,\u03b8)= x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nThen the envelope occurs where F=0 and dF/d\u03b8=0.\n\nCompute dF/d\u03b8:\n\nd/d\u03b8 [x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8] \n\n= x cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8 - [ cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 ].\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\nx cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8) =0.\n\nSo now, the envelope is the set of (x,y) satisfying both:\n\n1. x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\n2. x cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWe can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of \u03b8. Let me write them as:\n\nEquation 1: x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nEquation 2: x cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nLet me solve this system for x and y.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nx sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8. (1)\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8. (2)\n\nLet me solve equations (1) and (2) for x and y.\n\nLet me treat this as a linear system in variables x and y.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nsin\u03b8 * x + cos\u03b8 * y = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\ncos\u03b8 * x - sin\u03b8 * y = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nLet me write in matrix form:\n\n[ sin\u03b8   cos\u03b8 ] [x]   = [ sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 ]\n\n[ cos\u03b8  -sin\u03b8 ] [y]     [cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8]\n\nTo solve this, compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix:\n\nDeterminant D = sin\u03b8*(-sin\u03b8) - cos\u03b8*cos\u03b8 = -sin\u00b2\u03b8 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = - (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) = -1.\n\nSo the determinant is -1, so the system has a unique solution.\n\nUsing Cramer's rule:\n\nx = [ | sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8      sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 |\n\n         | cos\u03b8 -sin\u03b8   cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 | ] / D\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute using substitution or elimination.\n\nAlternatively, let's multiply equation (1) by sin\u03b8 and equation (2) by cos\u03b8, then add or subtract.\n\nAlternatively, let's solve for x from equation (1):\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nx sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8,\n\n=> x = cos\u03b8 - (y cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8,\n\nHmm, perhaps messy. Alternatively, let me solve equations (1) and (2):\n\nLet me denote equation (1):\n\nsin\u03b8 * x + cos\u03b8 * y = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8. (1)\n\nEquation (2):\n\ncos\u03b8 * x - sin\u03b8 * y = cos(2\u03b8). (since cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos2\u03b8) (2)\n\nLet me write equations (1) and (2):\n\nEquation (1): sin\u03b8 x + cos\u03b8 y = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nEquation (2): cos\u03b8 x - sin\u03b8 y = cos2\u03b8.\n\nLet me solve for x and y:\n\nLet me multiply equation (1) by sin\u03b8 and equation (2) by cos\u03b8:\n\nEquation (1)*sin\u03b8: sin\u00b2\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 y = sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nEquation (2)*cos\u03b8: cos\u00b2\u03b8 x - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 y = cos\u00b2(2\u03b8) ?\n\nWait, no, cos2\u03b8 times cos\u03b8? Wait, actually:\n\nWait equation (2) after multiplying by cos\u03b8:\n\ncos\u03b8*(cos\u03b8 x - sin\u03b8 y) = cos\u03b8 * cos2\u03b8,\n\nSo cos\u00b2\u03b8 x - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 y = cos\u03b8 cos2\u03b8,\n\nNow, add the modified equations (1)*sin\u03b8 and (2)*cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 x + cos\u00b2\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 y - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 y = sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 cos2\u03b8,\n\nSimplify left side: x (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + 0 = x*1,\n\nRight side: cos\u03b8 (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos2\u03b8).\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = cos\u03b8 ( sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos2\u03b8 )\n\nSimilarly, let's compute sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos2\u03b8.\n\nNote that cos2\u03b8 = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nSo sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 +1 - 2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = cos\u03b8 * cos\u00b2\u03b8 = cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, let me do the same by eliminating y. Let me subtract equations appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, let's do similar steps for y.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the expressions again.\n\nAlternatively, let me subtract equations:\n\nTake equation (1) multiplied by cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 x + cos\u00b2\u03b8 y = sin\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nand equation (2) multiplied by sin\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 x - sin\u00b2\u03b8 y = sin\u03b8 cos2\u03b8,\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n[ sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 x + cos\u00b2\u03b8 y ] - [ sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 x - sin\u00b2\u03b8 y ] = sin\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos2\u03b8,\n\nLeft side: cos\u00b2\u03b8 y + sin\u00b2\u03b8 y = y (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) = y.\n\nRight side: sin\u03b8 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 - cos2\u03b8).\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = sin\u03b8 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 - cos2\u03b8).\n\nCompute cos\u00b2\u03b8 - cos2\u03b8:\n\ncos2\u03b8 = 2cos\u00b2\u03b8 -1,\n\nThus, cos\u00b2\u03b8 - cos2\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - (2cos\u00b2\u03b8 -1) = -cos\u00b2\u03b8 +1 = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = sin\u03b8 * sin\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nThus, the envelope is parametrized by \u03b8 as:\n\nx = cos\u00b3\u03b8,\n\ny = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the envelope of the family of lines PQ is the astroid curve x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1, but actually, parametrized as x=cos\u00b3\u03b8, y=sin\u00b3\u03b8. The standard astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1, so indeed, this parametrization gives the astroid. \n\nTherefore, the envelope of all these lines PQ is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1. \n\nTherefore, the lines PQ are tangent to the astroid at points (cos\u00b3\u03b8, sin\u00b3\u03b8). \n\nNow, the point C is on AB and also on the astroid? Wait, but the problem says that C is not on any segment from F except AB. Since the envelope is the astroid, the points on the astroid are the points where the lines PQ are tangent. So, points on the astroid lie on exactly one line from the family F (the tangent line at that point). \n\nTherefore, the point C must be the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Because then, AB would be the only line from F that passes through C, since at the tangent point, only the tangent line passes through it, and other lines from F don't. \n\nTherefore, to find point C, we need to find the point where line AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nTherefore, we can find the point of tangency between line AB and the astroid.\n\nAlternatively, since the astroid is parametrized as (cos\u00b3\u03b8, sin\u00b3\u03b8), and line AB has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let me see if these can intersect tangentially.\n\nTo find the point of tangency, we can set the parametric equations of the astroid into the line equation and find \u03b8 such that the system has a double root, i.e., the line is tangent to the astroid.\n\nAlternatively, substitute x = cos\u00b3\u03b8, y = sin\u00b3\u03b8 into the line equation:\n\nsin\u00b3\u03b8 = -sqrt(3) cos\u00b3\u03b8 + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe need to find \u03b8 where this holds, and also the derivative of the astroid at that point is equal to the slope of the line AB.\n\nThe slope of AB is -sqrt(3), as we had before.\n\nThe derivative of the astroid can be found parametrically. \n\nGiven x = cos\u00b3\u03b8, y = sin\u00b3\u03b8,\n\ndx/d\u03b8 = -3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8,\n\ndy/d\u03b8 = 3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nThus, dy/dx = (dy/d\u03b8)/(dx/d\u03b8) = [3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8]/[ -3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 ] = - (sin\u03b8)/(cos\u03b8) = -tan\u03b8.\n\nSo the slope of the astroid at parameter \u03b8 is -tan\u03b8.\n\nWe want this slope to equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3). So,\n\n-tan\u03b8 = -sqrt(3) => tan\u03b8 = sqrt(3) => \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 (since tan \u03c0/3 = sqrt(3)).\n\nTherefore, the point of tangency is at \u03b8= \u03c0/3.\n\nCompute the coordinates:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8,\n\ny = sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = ( (sqrt(3)/2) )^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\ncos(\u03c0/3) = 1/2, so cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3)= (1/2)^3 = 1/8,\n\nsin(\u03c0/3)= sqrt(3)/2, so sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3)= (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nTherefore, the point of tangency is (1/8, (3 sqrt(3))/8).\n\nBut we need to check if this point is on line AB.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nThe line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlugging x=1/8,\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8,\n\nWhich matches. So yes, that point is on AB.\n\nTherefore, the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nTherefore, OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/64) + (27/64) = (28)/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, 1 squared is 1, (3 sqrt(3)) squared is 9*3=27. So yes,\n\n(1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. \n\nTherefore, OC\u00b2 =7/16, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem states \"the unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B\". The point we found is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8). Let me check coordinates of A and B. A is (1/2,0) which is (4/8, 0), so 1/8 is less than 1/2, so it's between A and B. So that's okay.\n\nBut let me confirm that this is indeed the only such point. Since the astroid is tangent to AB at this point, so only that point on AB is on the astroid, hence only that point is on exactly one line from F (the tangent line, which is AB itself). All other points on AB would lie inside the astroid? Wait, actually, the astroid is inside the unit circle, but perhaps in the first quadrant, the line AB intersects the astroid only at that point?\n\nWait, let me check another point on AB. Let's take the midpoint of AB. Coordinates of midpoint would be ( (1/2 +0)/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/2)/2 ) = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Let's see if this is on the astroid:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (1/4)^(2/3) + (sqrt(3)/4)^(2/3).\n\nHmm, that's ( (1/4)^(2) )^(1/3) + ( ( (sqrt(3)/4)^2 )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, actually, (x)^(2/3) + (y)^(2/3) = [ (1/4)^(2) ]^(1/3) + [ ( (sqrt(3)/4)^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nWait, actually, (1/4)^(2/3) = (1^(2))/(4^(2/3)) = 1/( (4^(1/3))^2 )\n\nSimilarly, (sqrt(3)/4)^(2/3) = ( (sqrt(3))^2 )^(1/3) / (4^(2/3)) ) = (3)^(1/3)/ (4^(2/3))\n\nHmm, not sure, but it's complicated. However, since the point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) is the only point where AB is tangent to the astroid, so that's the only point on AB that's on the astroid. All other points on AB would not be on the astroid, so they would lie inside or outside?\n\nActually, the astroid is the envelope, so all the lines PQ are tangent to it, and the region inside the astroid is where the lines PQ don't reach. Wait, perhaps the segments PQ lie inside the first quadrant, forming the astroid as their envelope. So points on the astroid are the \"extremal\" points.\n\nTherefore, points on AB beyond the tangent point would be inside the astroid? Let me see:\n\nTake point A (1/2,0). Check x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (1/2)^(2/3) +0 \u2248 (0.63) +0 <1, so inside the astroid.\n\nSimilarly, point B (0, sqrt(3)/2). x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=0 + (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3). Let's compute:\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4, so (3/4)^(1/3) \u22480.908, so total is less than 1? Wait sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866, so (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3)= ( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 )^(1/3)= (3/4)^(1/3)\u22480.908, which is less than 1. Hmm, so actually both A and B are inside the astroid? Wait, but the astroid has vertices at (1,0), (0,1), etc., but scaled?\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. The standard astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1, which has vertices at (\u00b11,0), (0,\u00b11). But in our case, the parametrization is x=cos\u00b3\u03b8, y=sin\u00b3\u03b8, so when \u03b8=0, x=1, y=0; \u03b8=\u03c0/2, x=0, y=1. So the astroid here is indeed the standard astroid of radius 1. \n\nTherefore, points A (1/2,0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2\u22480.866) are inside the astroid because their coordinates raised to 2/3 and summed are less than 1. The point C (1/8, 3\u221a3/8) is on the astroid, so it's on the boundary. \n\nTherefore, the line AB passes through the astroid at point C, and that's the only point of intersection because it's tangent there. So any other point on AB would be inside the astroid, so they would lie on multiple segments PQ (since the astroid is the envelope). However, the point C is on the envelope, so only the tangent line (AB) passes through it. Therefore, this must be the desired point C.\n\nTherefore, OC\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 + (3\u221a3 /8)^2 = (1 + 27)/64 =28/64=7/16. So 7+16=23.\n\nWait but let me check once more. The coordinates of point C: when \u03b8=\u03c0/3, which gives x=cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3)= (1/2)^3=1/8, y=sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3)= ( (sqrt(3)/2) )^3= (3\u221a3)/8. So yes, that's correct. \n\nCalculating OC\u00b2: (1/8)^2 + ( (3\u221a3)/8 )^2 = (1 + 27)/64 =28/64=7/16. Yes. So 7 and 16 are coprime. 7+16=23.\n\nTherefore the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all line segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. There's a unique point C on segment AB (not A or B) that isn't on any segment from F except AB itself. We have to find OC\u00b2, express it as p/q with p and q coprime, and then find p + q.\n\nHmm. Let me visualize this. Points O, A, and B form a triangle. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the segment AB is part of this triangle. The family F is all the unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. The point C is special because it's only on AB and none of the other segments in F. So, C is not on any other unit-length segment from the x to y-axis except AB.\n\nFirst, maybe I should parametrize the points on AB. Let me find the equation of line AB. The coordinates of A are (1/2, 0) and B are (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). That simplifies to y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nSo any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) where t is between 0 and 1/2. Wait, since A is at x=1/2 and B is at x=0, so when t goes from 0 to 1/2, x goes from 0 to 1/2, but since AB is from A(1/2,0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2), actually the parameter t for the x-coordinate should go from 1/2 down to 0? Hmm, maybe better to parametrize with a parameter s from 0 to 1. Let me do that.\n\nLet\u2019s let parameter s go from 0 to 1, where s=0 corresponds to point A and s=1 corresponds to B. Then the coordinates of point C(s) would be:\n\nx-coordinate: 1/2 - (1/2)s (since moving from 1/2 to 0 as s goes from 0 to1)\n\ny-coordinate: 0 + (sqrt(3)/2)s (since moving from 0 to sqrt(3)/2 as s goes from 0 to1)\n\nSo coordinates: ( (1/2)(1 - s), (sqrt(3)/2)s )\n\nAlternatively, maybe using a different parameter. But perhaps parametrizing by x-coordinate is okay. Let me see.\n\nNow, the key is that point C is on some segment PQ in F (other than AB) only if it lies on AB. But the problem states that C is not on any segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments in F, C is not on them. So, C is not on any other unit-length segment between the axes except AB.\n\nTherefore, to find such a point C, we need that for any segment PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. But since the problem states that there is a unique such C on AB (other than A and B), so this point must be such that if you try to have a unit segment PQ (with P on x-axis, Q on y-axis) passing through C, the only one possible is AB itself.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the only point (other than A,B) on AB that is not covered by any other segment in F. So, for any other segment in F, they don't pass through C except AB. Therefore, for any other segment PQ in F (not AB), C is not on PQ. So, we need to find point C on AB so that it's not on any PQ except AB. So, the point C is not on any other unit segment between the axes except AB.\n\nTherefore, to find such a point, perhaps we need that for any other PQ in F, the line PQ doesn't pass through C. Therefore, the point C must lie in such a way that the only unit segment between axes passing through it is AB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the envelope of all these segments PQ. The point C is not on the envelope except AB. Hmm, perhaps another approach is better.\n\nLet me think of parametrizing a general segment PQ in F. Let me denote P as (a,0) on the x-axis and Q as (0,b) on the y-axis, such that the distance between P and Q is 1. So the distance formula gives sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = 1. So, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1. Since they are in the first quadrant, a and b are non-negative. But since PQ is in the first quadrant, the segment itself is in the first quadrant, so a and b are positive.\n\nSo the segments PQ are all the line segments from (a,0) to (0,b) with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 = 1, and a, b >0.\n\nNow, the line PQ can be written as the line connecting (a,0) and (0,b). The equation of this line is x/a + y/b =1.\n\nSo any point (x,y) on PQ must satisfy x/a + y/b =1. \n\nNow, we want to find a point C on AB such that C is not on any such line PQ (except when PQ is AB itself). So, for point C, which is on AB, the coordinates of C must satisfy the equation of AB and also not satisfy x/a + y/b =1 for any a, b with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1 except when PQ is AB.\n\nTherefore, substituting the coordinates of C into x/a + y/b =1 should only be possible when (a,b) corresponds to the points A and B. Wait, but A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). So the segment AB is PQ with a =1/2 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Let me check: (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 =1, so that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the line AB is x/(1/2) + y/(sqrt(3)/2)=1, which simplifies to 2x + (2/sqrt(3)) y =1. But maybe that's not necessary.\n\nSo, the point C is on AB, so its coordinates are (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) for some t between 0 and 1/2. We need that for this point (x,y) = (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2), the equation x/a + y/b =1 cannot be satisfied by any a and b except a=1/2, b= sqrt(3)/2. \n\nWait, but the problem states that C is not on any segment from F except AB, so for any other PQ in F (i.e., any other a and b with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1 except a=1/2 and b= sqrt(3)/2), the point C should not lie on their line.\n\nTherefore, for the coordinates (t, y(t)), where y(t) = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2, the equation t/a + y(t)/b =1 must have no solutions (a,b) with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1 except (a,b)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nAlternatively, for all other (a,b) with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1, the equation t/a + y(t)/b \u22601.\n\nBut how do we ensure that? Perhaps, for the point C, the system of equations:\n\nt/a + y(t)/b =1,\n\nand a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1,\n\nhas only the solution (a,b)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So we need that the only solution (a,b) to the two equations is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nTherefore, substituting y(t) into the first equation:\n\nt/a + [ -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / b =1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n(t)/a + [ sqrt(3)( (1/2) - t ) ] / b =1.\n\nWe need this equation to hold only when a=1/2 and b= sqrt(3)/2. So, for other a and b on the unit circle, this equation should not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for the point C, the equation t/a + y(t)/b =1 has only one solution (a,b) on the unit circle, which is the one corresponding to AB. Therefore, the system of equations must have a unique solution. To ensure that, maybe the point C must lie such that the line PQ (for other a,b) does not pass through it. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is the intersection point of AB with some envelope of the family F. The envelope of the family of lines x/a + y/b =1 with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1. Maybe the envelope touches AB at point C, so that C is the only point on AB that is on the envelope. Hmm, that might be a way to think about it.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for the point C, the line PQ must be tangent to some curve. Wait, perhaps the envelope of all these lines PQ is a curve, and C is the point where AB is tangent to this envelope?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to find such a point C, we can set up the equations such that the system of equations has a unique solution (a,b). Let me see.\n\nSuppose we set up the equations:\n\nt/a + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / b =1,\n\nand\n\na\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe want that these equations have only one solution (a,b) which is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). To find t such that this system has only that solution, perhaps we can think of this as an equation in a and b, and for the system to have only one solution, the equations must be dependent in some way, or the discriminant of the system is zero.\n\nAlternatively, we can parametrize a and b using trigonometric functions. Since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1, we can set a = cos\u03b8, b = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2 (since a and b are positive). Then the equation becomes:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me denote this equation as:\n\n(t) sec\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) csc\u03b8 =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps this is complicated, but maybe we can rearrange terms.\n\nAlternatively, let me let\u2019s set variables:\n\nLet\u2019s denote a = cos\u03b8, b = sin\u03b8. Then the equation becomes:\n\n(t)/cos\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\nt sin\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2 ] cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nt sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) t cos\u03b8 + (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nFactor terms with t:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + (sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 ) = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nHmm, perhaps solving for t?\n\nLet me write it as:\n\nt [ sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ] = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 )\n\nFactor right-hand side:\n\ncos\u03b8 [ sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 ]\n\nTherefore,\n\nt = [ cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / [ sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ]\n\nHmm, that's a complicated expression, but perhaps we can set this equal to t for some \u03b8, and find t such that this equation has only one solution \u03b8 (the one corresponding to AB).\n\nWait, the point C is on AB, so for the specific \u03b8 corresponding to AB, which is when a=1/2 and b= sqrt(3)/2. Let me check what \u03b8 that corresponds to.\n\nSince a = cos\u03b8 =1/2, so \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 (60 degrees). Similarly, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2. So \u03b8= \u03c0/3 is the angle for AB.\n\nTherefore, to ensure that for the given t, the equation above gives \u03b8= \u03c0/3 as the only solution, we need that when we solve for \u03b8, there is only one solution \u03b8= \u03c0/3. To have that, perhaps the equation for \u03b8 must have a double root at \u03b8= \u03c0/3. That is, when we set up the equation for \u03b8, the solution \u03b8= \u03c0/3 is a double root. \n\nAlternatively, maybe when we set up the equation for \u03b8, the numerator and denominator both have a common factor (\u03b8 - \u03c0/3)^2? Hmm, perhaps calculus could help here. Let me think of t as a parameter and set up the equation such that \u03b8= \u03c0/3 is a double root.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is where the envelope of the family of lines PQ touches AB. The envelope of the family of lines x/a + y/b =1 with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2=1 can be found by using the envelope condition. Let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves defined by F(x,y,a,b)=0 with some constraint can be found by solving F=0 and dF/da=0 (or dF/db=0) if the parameters are related. Hmm, but in this case, the parameters a and b are related by a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1. So maybe we can parametrize by a single variable.\n\nLet me try parametrizing with \u03b8 as before, so a=cos\u03b8, b=sin\u03b8. Then the line is x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8, because:\n\nOriginal line equation is x/a + y/b =1, so multiplying both sides by ab gives bx + ay = ab. But since a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1, so perhaps another way.\n\nWait, let me re-express the line equation:\n\nx/a + y/b =1.\n\nBut since a and b are related by a\u00b2 + b\u00b2=1, perhaps we can write the envelope equations.\n\nAlternatively, the envelope of the family of lines x/a + y/b =1 with a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1 can be found by using the condition for envelope. The envelope is found by solving the equations:\n\nF(x,y,a,b)= x/a + y/b -1 =0,\n\nand\n\ndF/da = -x/a\u00b2 - 0 +0 =0,\n\ndF/db = -y/b\u00b2 -0 +0=0,\n\nbut also considering the constraint a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 =1.\n\nWait, maybe better to parametrize with one variable. Let me use \u03b8 where a=cos\u03b8, b=sin\u03b8. Then the line equation becomes x cos\u03b8 + y sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nWait, let me verify:\n\nOriginal equation x/a + y/b =1, substituting a=cos\u03b8, b=sin\u03b8,\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nx sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nSo, x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nYes, that's the equation. \n\nSo the envelope of these lines can be found by differentiating with respect to \u03b8 and setting the derivative to zero.\n\nLet me denote F(x,y,\u03b8)= x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nThen the envelope occurs where F=0 and dF/d\u03b8=0.\n\nCompute dF/d\u03b8:\n\nd/d\u03b8 [x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8] \n\n= x cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8 - [ cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 ].\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\nx cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8 - (cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8) =0.\n\nSo now, the envelope is the set of (x,y) satisfying both:\n\n1. x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\n2. x cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nWe can solve these two equations for x and y in terms of \u03b8. Let me write them as:\n\nEquation 1: x sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nEquation 2: x cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nLet me solve this system for x and y.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nFrom equation 1:\n\nx sin\u03b8 + y cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8. (1)\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx cos\u03b8 - y sin\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8. (2)\n\nLet me solve equations (1) and (2) for x and y.\n\nLet me treat this as a linear system in variables x and y.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nsin\u03b8 * x + cos\u03b8 * y = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\ncos\u03b8 * x - sin\u03b8 * y = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nLet me write in matrix form:\n\n[ sin\u03b8   cos\u03b8 ] [x]   = [ sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 ]\n\n[ cos\u03b8  -sin\u03b8 ] [y]     [cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8]\n\nTo solve this, compute the determinant of the coefficient matrix:\n\nDeterminant D = sin\u03b8*(-sin\u03b8) - cos\u03b8*cos\u03b8 = -sin\u00b2\u03b8 - cos\u00b2\u03b8 = - (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) = -1.\n\nSo the determinant is -1, so the system has a unique solution.\n\nUsing Cramer's rule:\n\nx = [ | sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8      sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 |\n\n         | cos\u03b8 -sin\u03b8   cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 | ] / D\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute using substitution or elimination.\n\nAlternatively, let's multiply equation (1) by sin\u03b8 and equation (2) by cos\u03b8, then add or subtract.\n\nAlternatively, let's solve for x from equation (1):\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\nx sin\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - y cos\u03b8,\n\n=> x = cos\u03b8 - (y cos\u03b8)/sin\u03b8,\n\nHmm, perhaps messy. Alternatively, let me solve equations (1) and (2):\n\nLet me denote equation (1):\n\nsin\u03b8 * x + cos\u03b8 * y = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8. (1)\n\nEquation (2):\n\ncos\u03b8 * x - sin\u03b8 * y = cos(2\u03b8). (since cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos2\u03b8) (2)\n\nLet me write equations (1) and (2):\n\nEquation (1): sin\u03b8 x + cos\u03b8 y = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nEquation (2): cos\u03b8 x - sin\u03b8 y = cos2\u03b8.\n\nLet me solve for x and y:\n\nLet me multiply equation (1) by sin\u03b8 and equation (2) by cos\u03b8:\n\nEquation (1)*sin\u03b8: sin\u00b2\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 y = sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nEquation (2)*cos\u03b8: cos\u00b2\u03b8 x - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 y = cos\u00b2(2\u03b8) ?\n\nWait, no, cos2\u03b8 times cos\u03b8? Wait, actually:\n\nWait equation (2) after multiplying by cos\u03b8:\n\ncos\u03b8*(cos\u03b8 x - sin\u03b8 y) = cos\u03b8 * cos2\u03b8,\n\nSo cos\u00b2\u03b8 x - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 y = cos\u03b8 cos2\u03b8,\n\nNow, add the modified equations (1)*sin\u03b8 and (2)*cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 x + cos\u00b2\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 y - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 y = sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8 + cos\u03b8 cos2\u03b8,\n\nSimplify left side: x (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8) + 0 = x*1,\n\nRight side: cos\u03b8 (sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos2\u03b8).\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = cos\u03b8 ( sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos2\u03b8 )\n\nSimilarly, let's compute sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos2\u03b8.\n\nNote that cos2\u03b8 = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nSo sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos2\u03b8 = sin\u00b2\u03b8 +1 - 2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 = 1 - sin\u00b2\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx = cos\u03b8 * cos\u00b2\u03b8 = cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, let me do the same by eliminating y. Let me subtract equations appropriately.\n\nAlternatively, let's do similar steps for y.\n\nAlternatively, let's use the expressions again.\n\nAlternatively, let me subtract equations:\n\nTake equation (1) multiplied by cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 x + cos\u00b2\u03b8 y = sin\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nand equation (2) multiplied by sin\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 x - sin\u00b2\u03b8 y = sin\u03b8 cos2\u03b8,\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n[ sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 x + cos\u00b2\u03b8 y ] - [ sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 x - sin\u00b2\u03b8 y ] = sin\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos2\u03b8,\n\nLeft side: cos\u00b2\u03b8 y + sin\u00b2\u03b8 y = y (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8) = y.\n\nRight side: sin\u03b8 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 - cos2\u03b8).\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = sin\u03b8 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 - cos2\u03b8).\n\nCompute cos\u00b2\u03b8 - cos2\u03b8:\n\ncos2\u03b8 = 2cos\u00b2\u03b8 -1,\n\nThus, cos\u00b2\u03b8 - cos2\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - (2cos\u00b2\u03b8 -1) = -cos\u00b2\u03b8 +1 = sin\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nTherefore,\n\ny = sin\u03b8 * sin\u00b2\u03b8 = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nThus, the envelope is parametrized by \u03b8 as:\n\nx = cos\u00b3\u03b8,\n\ny = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nWait, that's interesting. So the envelope of the family of lines PQ is the astroid curve x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1, but actually, parametrized as x=cos\u00b3\u03b8, y=sin\u00b3\u03b8. The standard astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1, so indeed, this parametrization gives the astroid. \n\nTherefore, the envelope of all these lines PQ is the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1. \n\nTherefore, the lines PQ are tangent to the astroid at points (cos\u00b3\u03b8, sin\u00b3\u03b8). \n\nNow, the point C is on AB and also on the astroid? Wait, but the problem says that C is not on any segment from F except AB. Since the envelope is the astroid, the points on the astroid are the points where the lines PQ are tangent. So, points on the astroid lie on exactly one line from the family F (the tangent line at that point). \n\nTherefore, the point C must be the point where AB is tangent to the astroid. Because then, AB would be the only line from F that passes through C, since at the tangent point, only the tangent line passes through it, and other lines from F don't. \n\nTherefore, to find point C, we need to find the point where line AB is tangent to the astroid x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=1.\n\nTherefore, we can find the point of tangency between line AB and the astroid.\n\nAlternatively, since the astroid is parametrized as (cos\u00b3\u03b8, sin\u00b3\u03b8), and line AB has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let me see if these can intersect tangentially.\n\nTo find the point of tangency, we can set the parametric equations of the astroid into the line equation and find \u03b8 such that the system has a double root, i.e., the line is tangent to the astroid.\n\nAlternatively, substitute x = cos\u00b3\u03b8, y = sin\u00b3\u03b8 into the line equation:\n\nsin\u00b3\u03b8 = -sqrt(3) cos\u00b3\u03b8 + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe need to find \u03b8 where this holds, and also the derivative of the astroid at that point is equal to the slope of the line AB.\n\nThe slope of AB is -sqrt(3), as we had before.\n\nThe derivative of the astroid can be found parametrically. \n\nGiven x = cos\u00b3\u03b8, y = sin\u00b3\u03b8,\n\ndx/d\u03b8 = -3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8,\n\ndy/d\u03b8 = 3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8,\n\nThus, dy/dx = (dy/d\u03b8)/(dx/d\u03b8) = [3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8]/[ -3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 ] = - (sin\u03b8)/(cos\u03b8) = -tan\u03b8.\n\nSo the slope of the astroid at parameter \u03b8 is -tan\u03b8.\n\nWe want this slope to equal the slope of AB, which is -sqrt(3). So,\n\n-tan\u03b8 = -sqrt(3) => tan\u03b8 = sqrt(3) => \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 (since tan \u03c0/3 = sqrt(3)).\n\nTherefore, the point of tangency is at \u03b8= \u03c0/3.\n\nCompute the coordinates:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = (1/2)^3 = 1/8,\n\ny = sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3) = ( (sqrt(3)/2) )^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nWait, let me compute that:\n\ncos(\u03c0/3) = 1/2, so cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3)= (1/2)^3 = 1/8,\n\nsin(\u03c0/3)= sqrt(3)/2, so sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3)= (sqrt(3)/2)^3 = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nTherefore, the point of tangency is (1/8, (3 sqrt(3))/8).\n\nBut we need to check if this point is on line AB.\n\nLet me verify:\n\nThe line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlugging x=1/8,\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8,\n\nWhich matches. So yes, that point is on AB.\n\nTherefore, the point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nTherefore, OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/64) + (27/64) = (28)/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, 1 squared is 1, (3 sqrt(3)) squared is 9*3=27. So yes,\n\n(1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. \n\nTherefore, OC\u00b2 =7/16, so p=7, q=16, p+q=23.\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem states \"the unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B\". The point we found is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8). Let me check coordinates of A and B. A is (1/2,0) which is (4/8, 0), so 1/8 is less than 1/2, so it's between A and B. So that's okay.\n\nBut let me confirm that this is indeed the only such point. Since the astroid is tangent to AB at this point, so only that point on AB is on the astroid, hence only that point is on exactly one line from F (the tangent line, which is AB itself). All other points on AB would lie inside the astroid? Wait, actually, the astroid is inside the unit circle, but perhaps in the first quadrant, the line AB intersects the astroid only at that point?\n\nWait, let me check another point on AB. Let's take the midpoint of AB. Coordinates of midpoint would be ( (1/2 +0)/2, (0 + sqrt(3)/2)/2 ) = (1/4, sqrt(3)/4). Let's see if this is on the astroid:\n\nx^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (1/4)^(2/3) + (sqrt(3)/4)^(2/3).\n\nHmm, that's ( (1/4)^(2) )^(1/3) + ( ( (sqrt(3)/4)^2 )^(1/3) )\n\nWait, actually, (x)^(2/3) + (y)^(2/3) = [ (1/4)^(2) ]^(1/3) + [ ( (sqrt(3)/4)^2 ) ]^(1/3 )\n\nWait, actually, (1/4)^(2/3) = (1^(2))/(4^(2/3)) = 1/( (4^(1/3))^2 )\n\nSimilarly, (sqrt(3)/4)^(2/3) = ( (sqrt(3))^2 )^(1/3) / (4^(2/3)) ) = (3)^(1/3)/ (4^(2/3))\n\nHmm, not sure, but it's complicated. However, since the point (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8) is the only point where AB is tangent to the astroid, so that's the only point on AB that's on the astroid. All other points on AB would not be on the astroid, so they would lie inside or outside?\n\nActually, the astroid is the envelope, so all the lines PQ are tangent to it, and the region inside the astroid is where the lines PQ don't reach. Wait, perhaps the segments PQ lie inside the first quadrant, forming the astroid as their envelope. So points on the astroid are the \"extremal\" points.\n\nTherefore, points on AB beyond the tangent point would be inside the astroid? Let me see:\n\nTake point A (1/2,0). Check x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) = (1/2)^(2/3) +0 \u2248 (0.63) +0 <1, so inside the astroid.\n\nSimilarly, point B (0, sqrt(3)/2). x^(2/3) + y^(2/3)=0 + (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3). Let's compute:\n\n(sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4, so (3/4)^(1/3) \u22480.908, so total is less than 1? Wait sqrt(3)/2 \u22480.866, so (sqrt(3)/2)^(2/3)= ( (sqrt(3)/2)^2 )^(1/3)= (3/4)^(1/3)\u22480.908, which is less than 1. Hmm, so actually both A and B are inside the astroid? Wait, but the astroid has vertices at (1,0), (0,1), etc., but scaled?\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. The standard astroid is x^(2/3) + y^(2/3) =1, which has vertices at (\u00b11,0), (0,\u00b11). But in our case, the parametrization is x=cos\u00b3\u03b8, y=sin\u00b3\u03b8, so when \u03b8=0, x=1, y=0; \u03b8=\u03c0/2, x=0, y=1. So the astroid here is indeed the standard astroid of radius 1. \n\nTherefore, points A (1/2,0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2\u22480.866) are inside the astroid because their coordinates raised to 2/3 and summed are less than 1. The point C (1/8, 3\u221a3/8) is on the astroid, so it's on the boundary. \n\nTherefore, the line AB passes through the astroid at point C, and that's the only point of intersection because it's tangent there. So any other point on AB would be inside the astroid, so they would lie on multiple segments PQ (since the astroid is the envelope). However, the point C is on the envelope, so only the tangent line (AB) passes through it. Therefore, this must be the desired point C.\n\nTherefore, OC\u00b2 is (1/8)^2 + (3\u221a3 /8)^2 = (1 + 27)/64 =28/64=7/16. So 7+16=23.\n\nWait but let me check once more. The coordinates of point C: when \u03b8=\u03c0/3, which gives x=cos\u00b3(\u03c0/3)= (1/2)^3=1/8, y=sin\u00b3(\u03c0/3)= ( (sqrt(3)/2) )^3= (3\u221a3)/8. So yes, that's correct. \n\nCalculating OC\u00b2: (1/8)^2 + ( (3\u221a3)/8 )^2 = (1 + 27)/64 =28/64=7/16. Yes. So 7 and 16 are coprime. 7+16=23.\n\nTherefore the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n\n\nGiven points \\( O(0,0) \\), \\( A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) \\), and \\( B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\), we need to find the point \\( C \\) on segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) that does not lie on any segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) except \\( \\overline{AB} \\). \n\nThe family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) consists of segments \\( \\overline{PQ} \\) of unit length with \\( P \\) on the \\( x \\)-axis and \\( Q \\) on the \\( y \\)-axis.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to understand it first. The points given are O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all line segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. The task is to find a unique point C on segment AB (other than A and B themselves) that isn't part of any segment from F except for the segment AB itself. Then, we need to compute OC squared, express it as a reduced fraction p/q, and find p + q.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. So first, the family F is all the unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. Each segment starts on the x-axis (so point P has coordinates (p, 0) for some p \u2265 0) and ends on the y-axis (so point Q has coordinates (0, q) for some q \u2265 0), and the distance between P and Q is 1. Since they are in the first quadrant, both p and q are non-negative.\n\nThe key here is that there's a point C on AB, not at A or B, such that C isn't on any of these segments except AB. So, C is only on AB and not on any other segment from F. That suggests that for any other segment in F that passes through C, that segment must coincide with AB. Since AB is also a segment in F? Wait, actually, first, is AB part of F?\n\nWait, AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check if AB has length 1. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is indeed a member of F. Therefore, the point C must lie on AB, not at A or B, and must not lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, for every other segment in F that passes through C, that segment must be AB itself. Therefore, C is only on AB and no other F segments.\n\nTherefore, we need to find such a point C on AB where if you consider all possible segments in F that pass through C, the only one that does so is AB. So, C must be such that any other unit segment from the x-axis to y-axis passing through C must coincide with AB. That sounds like C is a point where AB is the only unit segment in F through it. So, perhaps the point where the only unit segment passing through it is AB.\n\nTo approach this, maybe we need to parametrize all the segments in F and then find a point C on AB that is not on any other segment except AB.\n\nLet me think. Let me parametrise the segments in F first. Let\u2019s suppose a general segment in F is from point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), with the distance between them being 1. Then, the distance formula gives sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. Therefore, all such segments correspond to points (p, 0) on the x-axis and (0, q) on the y-axis where p and q are non-negative and satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, the segments are parameterized by p (or q) such that p is between 0 and 1, and similarly q between 0 and 1.\n\nEach such segment can be represented as the line from (p,0) to (0,q). The equation of the line PQ can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, since it's intercept form. Alternatively, in slope-intercept form, but maybe intercept form is easier here.\n\nNow, we need to find a point C on AB such that C is only on AB and no other such lines (from F). So, for point C, which is on AB, we need that the only line from F passing through C is AB itself. So, if we can express the coordinates of C in terms of AB, and then set up the condition that any other line from F passing through C must coincide with AB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parametrise point C on AB first. Let's parametrise AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the parametric equations for AB can be given by:\n\nLet\u2019s let t be a parameter from 0 to 1, where at t=0 we are at A, and t=1 at B. So,\n\nx(t) = (1/2)(1 - t)\n\ny(t) = (sqrt(3)/2) t\n\nTherefore, any point C on AB can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1. Since we want a point distinct from A and B, t is between 0 and 1, not including the endpoints.\n\nSo, we need to find t such that the point ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) is not on any segment in F except AB.\n\nSo, suppose that point C is on some segment PQ in F (other than AB). Then, C must lie on the line PQ, which is given by x/p + y/q = 1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, for C to lie on such a line, the coordinates of C must satisfy ( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / q = 1. Also, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe need to ensure that the only solution (p, q) to these equations is the one corresponding to AB. For AB, p is 1/2 and q is sqrt(3)/2, since A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check: p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2. Then p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (1/4) + (3/4) = 1, which is correct.\n\nSo, the equations for another segment PQ passing through C would be:\n\n( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / q = 1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe want to have that the only solution (p, q) is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, for the point C to satisfy this uniqueness, the system of equations above must have only that solution. So, for the given t, the equations must have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set up the equations such that the only solution is p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2. So, we can think of this as a system of equations in variables p and q, with parameters t. For the system to have only one solution, the equations must be dependent or something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for a general point C on AB, there is another segment PQ in F passing through C, except when C is at a special position. To find that position, we can suppose that there exists another segment PQ through C, so there exists p and q (not equal to the AB's p and q) such that the point C lies on PQ. We need to find the t where such p and q cannot exist except the AB's one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to find the point C such that the line AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because if a point lies on an envelope, it's tangent to the family, so maybe that's the point?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the envelope of all these segments in F. The envelope is a curve such that each segment is tangent to it. The point C might be where AB is tangent to the envelope? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, since we need that there is only one segment through C, which would be the case if C is on the envelope of the family F. But then, perhaps the envelope is a curve, and AB is tangent to it at point C? Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another approach. Let me suppose that for a point C on AB, there exists another segment PQ in F passing through C. Let me write the equations for that.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of C as (x, y) which is on AB. Since C is on AB, it can be parametrized as x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2) t for some t between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, suppose that there exists another segment PQ (not AB) in F passing through C. Then, the line PQ must satisfy x/p + y/q = 1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, and (p, q) \u2260 (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, substituting x and y:\n\n[( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p ] + [ ( (sqrt(3)/2 t ) / q ] = 1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe need to ensure that for our desired point C, the only solution (p, q) is the one for AB. Therefore, for such a point, the above equations must have only that solution. So, to find C, we need to find x and y (on AB) such that the system has only the solution p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can set up the equations so that they have only one solution. Let me consider the equations as equations in p and q. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote x = (1/2)(1 - t) and y = (sqrt(3)/2) t. Then, substituting into the equation:\n\n(x)/p + (y)/q = 1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n[( (1 - t)/2 ) / p] + [ (sqrt(3) t / 2 ) / q ] = 1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe need to find t such that this system has only the solution p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of this as a system of equations, we can solve for p and q given t, and find t where the only solution is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Let me see.\n\nLet me denote the first equation as:\n\n[(1 - t)/(2p)] + [ (sqrt(3) t)/(2q) ] = 1.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by 2pq to eliminate denominators:\n\n(1 - t) q + sqrt(3) t p = 2 p q.\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\n(1 - t) q + sqrt(3) t p - 2 p q = 0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Let me see if I can express one variable in terms of the other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me let p = sqrt(1 - q\u00b2), since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Wait, but p and q are both positive here, so p = sqrt(1 - q\u00b2). Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps parameterize p and q in terms of an angle?\n\nSince p and q satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, they can be represented as p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2 (since p and q are positive). Then, the equation becomes:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, substituting x and y from point C on AB:\n\n[ (1/2)(1 - t) ] / cos\u03b8 + [ (sqrt(3)/2 t ) ] / sin\u03b8 = 1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n(1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sin\u03b8) = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(1 - t)/cos\u03b8 + (sqrt(3) t)/sin\u03b8 = 2.\n\nWe need this equation to hold for \u03b8 such that cos\u03b8 = p and sin\u03b8 = q for some segment PQ. The point C is on PQ if there exists a \u03b8 (other than the one corresponding to AB) such that the above equation is satisfied. The point C we want is such that the only \u03b8 satisfying this is the one for AB. Let me see what \u03b8 corresponds to AB.\n\nFor AB, p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2, so cos\u03b8 = 1/2, so \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 (60 degrees). Therefore, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2. So, the angle \u03b8 for AB is \u03c0/3. So, for our desired point C, the equation above must only have \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 as a solution. Therefore, the equation:\n\n(1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sin\u03b8) = 1,\n\nmust have \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 as its only solution for \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2). So, to find t such that this equation only holds at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, we can consider this as an equation in \u03b8 and set up that it has a double root at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, so that it's tangent there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the equation in \u03b8 and set its derivative to zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 so that it has a double root. Hmm, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of this equation as:\n\nLet me denote the left-hand side as f(\u03b8, t) = (1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sin\u03b8).\n\nWe want f(\u03b8, t) = 1, and we want this equation to have only one solution \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 for the given t. To ensure that, we can require that \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 is a solution, and that the function f(\u03b8, t) - 1 has a double root at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, so that the equation is tangent there, so that there's only one solution. That might be the way.\n\nTherefore, if we set up that f(\u03b8, t) - 1 has a double root at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, then that would mean that not only f(\u03b8, t) -1 =0 at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, but also the derivative with respect to \u03b8 is zero there. So, let's do that.\n\nFirst, compute f(\u03c0/3, t) must equal 1. Let's check that:\n\nf(\u03c0/3, t) = (1 - t)/(2 * cos(\u03c0/3)) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 * sin(\u03c0/3)).\n\nWe know cos(\u03c0/3) = 1/2, sin(\u03c0/3) = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore:\n\nFirst term: (1 - t)/(2*(1/2)) = (1 - t)/1 = (1 - t).\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3) t)/(2*(sqrt(3)/2)) = (sqrt(3) t)/(sqrt(3)) = t.\n\nSo, f(\u03c0/3, t) = (1 - t) + t = 1. So that checks out, as expected.\n\nNow, to have a double root at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, the derivative of f(\u03b8, t) with respect to \u03b8 must also be zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3. Let's compute the derivative.\n\nFirst, let me write f(\u03b8, t):\n\nf(\u03b8, t) = (1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sin\u03b8).\n\nCompute derivative f\u2019(\u03b8, t):\n\nFirst term derivative: d/d\u03b8 [ (1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8) ] = (1 - t)/(2) * sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 ?\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step. Let me denote the first term as A = (1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8). Then,\n\ndA/d\u03b8 = (1 - t)/2 * d/d\u03b8 (1/cos\u03b8) = (1 - t)/2 * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, the second term B = (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sin\u03b8).\n\ndB/d\u03b8 = (sqrt(3) t)/2 * d/d\u03b8 (1/sin\u03b8) = (sqrt(3) t)/2 * (-cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nTherefore, the derivative f\u2019(\u03b8, t) = dA/d\u03b8 + dB/d\u03b8:\n\n= (1 - t)/2 * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8) - (sqrt(3) t)/2 * (cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nWe need this derivative to be zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3.\n\nLet me compute f\u2019(\u03c0/3, t):\n\nFirst, compute cos(\u03c0/3) = 1/2, sin(\u03c0/3) = sqrt(3)/2, so cos\u03b8 = 1/2, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlugging into f\u2019:\n\nFirst term:\n\n(1 - t)/2 * ( (sqrt(3)/2) / ( (1/2)^2 ) )\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nFirst term numerator: sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2,\n\nDenominator: cos\u00b2\u03b8 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4,\n\nSo sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = (sqrt(3)/2) / (1/4) ) = (sqrt(3)/2) * 4 = 2 sqrt(3).\n\nSo first term becomes (1 - t)/2 * 2 sqrt(3) = (1 - t) sqrt(3).\n\nSecond term:\n\n- (sqrt(3) t)/2 * ( cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nCompute cos\u03b8 = 1/2,\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4,\n\nThus cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (1/2) / (3/4) = (1/2)*(4/3) = 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the second term is - (sqrt(3) t)/2 * (2/3) = - (sqrt(3) t)/2 * 2/3 = - (sqrt(3) t)/3.\n\nPutting together, the derivative at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 is:\n\n(1 - t) sqrt(3) - (sqrt(3) t)/3 = sqrt(3) [ (1 - t) - t/3 ].\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\nsqrt(3) [ (1 - t) - (t/3) ] = 0.\n\nSince sqrt(3) \u2260 0,\n\n(1 - t) - (t/3) = 0\n\nMultiply through:\n\n1 - t - t/3 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 - ( (3t + t)/3 ) = 1 - (4t)/3 = 0\n\nThus,\n\n1 = (4t)/3 => t = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, when t = 3/4, the derivative at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 is zero, so the equation f(\u03b8, t) =1 has a double root there, meaning that \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 is the only solution (since it's a double root). Therefore, the point C corresponding to t = 3/4 is the desired point.\n\nTherefore, let's compute the coordinates of C when t = 3/4:\n\nx-coordinate: (1/2)(1 - t) = (1/2)(1 - 3/4) = (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8.\n\ny-coordinate: (sqrt(3)/2)(3/4) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nTherefore, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nThen, OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/64) + (9 * 3)/64 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check again.\n\nWait, (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64.\n\nSo, 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, OC squared is 7/16, so p = 7, q =16, which are coprime. So p + q = 23.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm again if this is correct. Let me verify each step again.\n\nFirst, parametrization of AB: with t from 0 to1,\n\nx(t) = (1/2)(1 - t),\n\ny(t) = (sqrt(3)/2) t,\n\nso when t=0, (1/2,0) which is A, and t=1 gives (0, sqrt(3)/2) which is B. Correct.\n\nThen, for the point C on AB, we parametrized with t, and set up the equation for another segment in F passing through C. Then, we considered the equation in terms of \u03b8 (angle parameter) and set up the condition for double root at \u03b8=pi/3, leading to t=3/4. Then, coordinates of C are (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). Then OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. So, 7 + 16 = 23. That seems okay.\n\nWait, but let me check again whether t=3/4 gives the point where only AB passes through it. Let me see.\n\nSuppose t=3/4, so C is (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). Let me see if there's another segment PQ in F passing through this point. Suppose there is another segment, with parameters p and q not equal to (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Let me see if such p and q exist.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\nx/p + y/q = 1,\n\nwith p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nand x =1/8, y=3sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\n(1/8)/p + (3sqrt(3)/8)/q = 1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me see if there's another solution besides p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me suppose that p and q are different. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote equation 1: (1)/(8p) + (3 sqrt(3))/(8 q) =1,\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me multiply equation 1 by 8:\n\n1/p + 3 sqrt(3)/q =8.\n\nLet me denote variables as p and q. Let me see if there's another solution.\n\nSuppose p =1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2:\n\n1/(1/2) + 3 sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2 + 3*2 = 2 +6=8, which works. So that's the known solution.\n\nSuppose there is another solution. Let me assume p \u22601/2.\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\n1/p =8 - 3 sqrt(3)/q,\n\nso p=1/(8 - 3 sqrt(3)/q).\n\nHmm, perhaps substitution into equation 2 is messy. Alternatively, let me let q = k p, so that q = kp, then equation 2 becomes p\u00b2 +k\u00b2 p\u00b2 =1 => p\u00b2 (1 +k\u00b2)=1 => p=1/sqrt(1 +k\u00b2).\n\nBut maybe that complicates.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that the other solution corresponds to the angle \u03b8 where the equation f(theta, t)=1 has another solution besides theta=pi/3. But earlier, when we set t=3/4, we forced that the equation has a double root at theta=pi/3, so that there is only one solution. Hence, there should be no other solution. Therefore, that point is indeed only on AB. So, this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7/16, so 7+16=23.\n\nWait, but let me check once more by plugging in numbers. Let me try to see if there is another segment through C.\n\nSuppose someone claims that there is another segment PQ through C with p= something else.\n\nSuppose I pick p=0. Let me see, but p=0 would not be in the first quadrant? Wait, p must be between 0 and1, but p=0 would be the point Q on the y-axis. Similarly, q must be between 0 and1.\n\nAlternatively, pick some p and solve for q.\n\nLet me take p = 1/4. Then, equation 1:\n\n1/(8*(1/4)) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) =1,\n\nWhich is 1/(2) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) =1,\n\nSo 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) = 1 - 1/2 =1/2,\n\nThus, 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) =1/2,\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 q: 3 sqrt(3) =4 q,\n\nThus q= (3 sqrt(3))/4 \u2248 (5.196)/4 \u22481.299, but q must be \u22641, so this is invalid.\n\nAnother p, say p=1/3.\n\nThen equation1:\n\n1/(8*(1/3)) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q)=1,\n\n=> 3/(8) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) =1,\n\n=> 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) =5/8,\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 q: 3 sqrt(3) =5 q,\n\nq= 3 sqrt(3)/5 \u2248 (5.196)/5\u22481.039, still over 1.\n\nHmm, over 1.\n\nWhat about p= 1/ sqrt(2), which is approx 0.707.\n\nThen, equation1:\n\n1/(8*(1/sqrt(2))) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q)=1,\n\n=> sqrt(2)/8 + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q)=1,\n\nMultiply all terms by 8:\n\nsqrt(2) + 3 sqrt(3)/q =8,\n\nThen 3 sqrt(3)/q =8 - sqrt(2),\n\nThus q= 3 sqrt(3)/(8 - sqrt(2)).\n\nCompute denominator: approx 8 -1.414\u22486.586,\n\nNumerator: 3*1.732\u22485.196,\n\nThus q\u22485.196 /6.586\u22480.789, which is less than 1. So that would be acceptable.\n\nThen, check if p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 \u2248 (0.5)^2 + (0.789)^2 \u22480.25 +0.622\u22480.872, which is less than 1. So that would not satisfy equation2 (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1). Therefore, invalid.\n\nWait, but equation2 requires p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So even if q is less than1, but p is 1/sqrt(2), then p squared is 0.5, so q squared would need to be 0.5. But in this case, q\u22480.789, which squared is ~0.622, so total 0.5+0.622=1.122>1. So that's invalid. Therefore, that is not a solution.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there is no solution except p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that there is another solution. Let me set up equations.\n\nLet me denote equation1:\n\n1/(8p) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q)=1,\n\nand equation2: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me multiply equation1 by 8:\n\n1/p + 3 sqrt(3)/q =8,\n\nLet me denote equation A: 1/p + 3 sqrt(3)/q =8,\n\nEquation B: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nLet me let\u2019s suppose variables p and q. Let me solve equation A for 1/p:\n\n1/p =8 - 3 sqrt(3)/q,\n\nthen p = 1/(8 - 3 sqrt(3)/q).\n\nSubstitute into equation B:\n\n[1/(8 - 3 sqrt(3)/q)]\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, let me let\u2019s set u =1/p and v=1/q. Then equation A becomes:\n\nu + 3 sqrt(3) v =8,\n\nand equation B becomes:\n\n1/u\u00b2 +1/v\u00b2 =1.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cross multiplying equation A:\n\nMultiply both sides by p q:\n\nq + 3 sqrt(3) p =8 p q,\n\nSo equation C: 8 p q -3 sqrt(3) p - q =0.\n\nAnd equation B: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nSo now, equations are:\n\n8 p q -3 sqrt(3) p - q =0,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me try to solve this system.\n\nLet me rearrange equation C: 8 p q - q =3 sqrt(3) p,\n\nFactor q: q(8p -1)= 3 sqrt(3) p,\n\nTherefore, q= [3 sqrt(3) p]/(8p -1).\n\nNow, substitute this into equation B:\n\np\u00b2 + [ (3 sqrt(3) p)/(8p -1) ]\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\np\u00b2 + (27 p\u00b2)/(8p -1)^2 =1.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote x = p for simplicity:\n\nx\u00b2 + 27 x\u00b2 / (8x -1)^2 =1.\n\nThis is a quartic equation. Let me see if x=1/2 is a solution:\n\nPlug x=1/2:\n\n(1/4) + 27*(1/4)/( (4 -1)^2 ) = 1/4 + (27/4)/9 = 1/4 + (3/4) = 1, which works.\n\nSo x=1/2 is a solution. Let me see if there is another solution.\n\nLet me let\u2019s set y =8x -1. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote denominator as (8x -1)^2, so:\n\nLet me multiply both sides by (8x -1)^2:\n\nx\u00b2 (8x -1)^2 +27 x\u00b2 = (8x -1)^2.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx\u00b2 (8x -1)^2 +27 x\u00b2 - (8x -1)^2 =0.\n\nLet me factor (8x -1)^2:\n\n[ x\u00b2 -1 ] (8x -1)^2 +27 x\u00b2 =0.\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, expand everything.\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2 (8x -1)^2:\n\nFirst compute (8x -1)^2 =64x\u00b2 -16x +1,\n\nMultiply by x\u00b2:\n\n64x^4 -16x^3 +x\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: +27x\u00b2,\n\nThird term: - (64x\u00b2 -16x +1).\n\nThus total:\n\n64x^4 -16x^3 +x\u00b2 +27x\u00b2 -64x\u00b2 +16x -1 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n64x^4 -16x^3 + (1 +27 -64)x\u00b2 +16x -1 =0,\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nx^4 term:64,\n\nx^3 term: -16,\n\nx\u00b2 term: (1+27-64)= -36,\n\nx term:+16,\n\nconstant term: -1.\n\nThus equation is:\n\n64x^4 -16x^3 -36x\u00b2 +16x -1 =0.\n\nHmm, quartic equation. Since we know that x=1/2 is a root, let's factor (x -1/2).\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nLet me write the polynomial as:\n\n64x^4 -16x^3 -36x\u00b2 +16x -1.\n\nLet me use synthetic division with root x=1/2.\n\nThe coefficients are: 64, -16, -36, 16, -1.\n\nDivide by (x -1/2):\n\nBring down 64.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: 32.\n\nAdd to next term: -16 +32=16.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:8.\n\nAdd to next term: -36 +8= -28.\n\nMultiply by1/2: -14.\n\nAdd to next term:16 + (-14)=2.\n\nMultiply by1/2:1.\n\nAdd to last term: -1 +1=0. Perfect.\n\nSo the polynomial factors as (x -1/2)(64x^3 +16x^2 -28x +2).\n\nNow, let's factor the cubic equation 64x\u00b3 +16x\u00b2 -28x +2.\n\nLet me see if x=1/2 is again a root:\n\nPlug in x=1/2:\n\n64*(1/8) +16*(1/4) -28*(1/2) +2 =8 +4 -14 +2=0. Yes, x=1/2 is a root again.\n\nThus, factor out another (x -1/2).\n\nDivide the cubic by (x -1/2):\n\nCoefficients:64, 16, -28, 2.\n\nUsing synthetic division with x=1/2:\n\nBring down 64.\n\nMultiply by1/2:32.\n\nAdd to next term:16 +32=48.\n\nMultiply by1/2:24.\n\nAdd to next term:-28 +24= -4.\n\nMultiply by1/2: -2.\n\nAdd to last term:2 + (-2)=0.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (x -1/2)(64x\u00b2 +48x -4).\n\nThus, the original quartic factors as (x -1/2)^2 (64x\u00b2 +48x -4).\n\nNow, set 64x\u00b2 +48x -4=0,\n\nDivide all terms by4:16x\u00b2 +12x -1=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\nx = [-12 \u00b1 sqrt(144 +64)]/(32)\n\nsqrt(208)=sqrt(16*13)=4 sqrt(13),\n\nThus,\n\nx= [ -12 \u00b14 sqrt(13) ] /32 = [ -3 \u00b1 sqrt(13) ] /8.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=1/2 (double root), and x= [ -3 + sqrt(13) ] /8 and [ -3 - sqrt(13) ] /8.\n\nThe last root is negative since sqrt(13)\u22483.605, so -3 -3.605 \u2248-6.605, divided by8 is still negative, so not in our domain (p>0). The other root: [ -3 + sqrt(13) ] /8 \u2248 (-3 +3.605)/8\u22480.605/8\u22480.0756, which is positive. So that is a possible solution.\n\nThus, there is another solution at x\u22480.0756. Let me check if that gives a valid q.\n\nSo x is p, so p= [ -3 + sqrt(13) ] /8 \u2248 ( -3 +3.6055)/8\u22480.6055/8\u22480.0757.\n\nCompute q from equation C: q= [3 sqrt(3) p]/(8p -1).\n\nPlugging p\u22480.0757:\n\n8p\u22480.6055, so denominator\u22480.6055 -1\u2248-0.3945,\n\nNumerator:3*sqrt(3)*0.0757\u22483*1.732*0.0757\u22480.3945.\n\nTherefore, q\u22480.3945 / (-0.3945)= -1. So q\u2248-1, which is negative. Since q must be positive, this is invalid. Hence, the only valid solution is p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, there is no other segment in F passing through C except AB. Therefore, t=3/4 gives the desired point.\n\nTherefore, OC squared is 7/16, so the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here. Let me try to understand it first. The points given are O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all line segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. The task is to find a unique point C on segment AB (other than A and B themselves) that isn't part of any segment from F except for the segment AB itself. Then, we need to compute OC squared, express it as a reduced fraction p/q, and find p + q.\n\nAlright, let me break this down. So first, the family F is all the unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. Each segment starts on the x-axis (so point P has coordinates (p, 0) for some p \u2265 0) and ends on the y-axis (so point Q has coordinates (0, q) for some q \u2265 0), and the distance between P and Q is 1. Since they are in the first quadrant, both p and q are non-negative.\n\nThe key here is that there's a point C on AB, not at A or B, such that C isn't on any of these segments except AB. So, C is only on AB and not on any other segment from F. That suggests that for any other segment in F that passes through C, that segment must coincide with AB. Since AB is also a segment in F? Wait, actually, first, is AB part of F?\n\nWait, AB goes from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check if AB has length 1. The distance between A and B is sqrt[(1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2] = sqrt[1/4 + 3/4] = sqrt[1] = 1. So yes, AB is indeed a member of F. Therefore, the point C must lie on AB, not at A or B, and must not lie on any other segment from F except AB. So, for every other segment in F that passes through C, that segment must be AB itself. Therefore, C is only on AB and no other F segments.\n\nTherefore, we need to find such a point C on AB where if you consider all possible segments in F that pass through C, the only one that does so is AB. So, C must be such that any other unit segment from the x-axis to y-axis passing through C must coincide with AB. That sounds like C is a point where AB is the only unit segment in F through it. So, perhaps the point where the only unit segment passing through it is AB.\n\nTo approach this, maybe we need to parametrize all the segments in F and then find a point C on AB that is not on any other segment except AB.\n\nLet me think. Let me parametrise the segments in F first. Let\u2019s suppose a general segment in F is from point P(p,0) to Q(0,q), with the distance between them being 1. Then, the distance formula gives sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. Therefore, all such segments correspond to points (p, 0) on the x-axis and (0, q) on the y-axis where p and q are non-negative and satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, the segments are parameterized by p (or q) such that p is between 0 and 1, and similarly q between 0 and 1.\n\nEach such segment can be represented as the line from (p,0) to (0,q). The equation of the line PQ can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, since it's intercept form. Alternatively, in slope-intercept form, but maybe intercept form is easier here.\n\nNow, we need to find a point C on AB such that C is only on AB and no other such lines (from F). So, for point C, which is on AB, we need that the only line from F passing through C is AB itself. So, if we can express the coordinates of C in terms of AB, and then set up the condition that any other line from F passing through C must coincide with AB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parametrise point C on AB first. Let's parametrise AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the parametric equations for AB can be given by:\n\nLet\u2019s let t be a parameter from 0 to 1, where at t=0 we are at A, and t=1 at B. So,\n\nx(t) = (1/2)(1 - t)\n\ny(t) = (sqrt(3)/2) t\n\nTherefore, any point C on AB can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1. Since we want a point distinct from A and B, t is between 0 and 1, not including the endpoints.\n\nSo, we need to find t such that the point ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) is not on any segment in F except AB.\n\nSo, suppose that point C is on some segment PQ in F (other than AB). Then, C must lie on the line PQ, which is given by x/p + y/q = 1, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So, for C to lie on such a line, the coordinates of C must satisfy ( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / q = 1. Also, p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe need to ensure that the only solution (p, q) to these equations is the one corresponding to AB. For AB, p is 1/2 and q is sqrt(3)/2, since A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me check: p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2. Then p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = (1/4) + (3/4) = 1, which is correct.\n\nSo, the equations for another segment PQ passing through C would be:\n\n( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p + ( (sqrt(3)/2) t ) / q = 1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe want to have that the only solution (p, q) is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Therefore, for the point C to satisfy this uniqueness, the system of equations above must have only that solution. So, for the given t, the equations must have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can set up the equations such that the only solution is p = 1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2. So, we can think of this as a system of equations in variables p and q, with parameters t. For the system to have only one solution, the equations must be dependent or something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for a general point C on AB, there is another segment PQ in F passing through C, except when C is at a special position. To find that position, we can suppose that there exists another segment PQ through C, so there exists p and q (not equal to the AB's p and q) such that the point C lies on PQ. We need to find the t where such p and q cannot exist except the AB's one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to find the point C such that the line AB is tangent to some envelope of the family F. Because if a point lies on an envelope, it's tangent to the family, so maybe that's the point?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the envelope of all these segments in F. The envelope is a curve such that each segment is tangent to it. The point C might be where AB is tangent to the envelope? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, since we need that there is only one segment through C, which would be the case if C is on the envelope of the family F. But then, perhaps the envelope is a curve, and AB is tangent to it at point C? Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, let's try another approach. Let me suppose that for a point C on AB, there exists another segment PQ in F passing through C. Let me write the equations for that.\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of C as (x, y) which is on AB. Since C is on AB, it can be parametrized as x = (1/2)(1 - t), y = (sqrt(3)/2) t for some t between 0 and 1.\n\nNow, suppose that there exists another segment PQ (not AB) in F passing through C. Then, the line PQ must satisfy x/p + y/q = 1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, and (p, q) \u2260 (1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nSo, substituting x and y:\n\n[( (1/2)(1 - t) ) / p ] + [ ( (sqrt(3)/2 t ) / q ] = 1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe need to ensure that for our desired point C, the only solution (p, q) is the one for AB. Therefore, for such a point, the above equations must have only that solution. So, to find C, we need to find x and y (on AB) such that the system has only the solution p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can set up the equations so that they have only one solution. Let me consider the equations as equations in p and q. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote x = (1/2)(1 - t) and y = (sqrt(3)/2) t. Then, substituting into the equation:\n\n(x)/p + (y)/q = 1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n[( (1 - t)/2 ) / p] + [ (sqrt(3) t / 2 ) / q ] = 1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nWe need to find t such that this system has only the solution p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, if we think of this as a system of equations, we can solve for p and q given t, and find t where the only solution is (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Let me see.\n\nLet me denote the first equation as:\n\n[(1 - t)/(2p)] + [ (sqrt(3) t)/(2q) ] = 1.\n\nLet me multiply both sides by 2pq to eliminate denominators:\n\n(1 - t) q + sqrt(3) t p = 2 p q.\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\n(1 - t) q + sqrt(3) t p - 2 p q = 0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Let me see if I can express one variable in terms of the other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use substitution. Let me let p = sqrt(1 - q\u00b2), since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Wait, but p and q are both positive here, so p = sqrt(1 - q\u00b2). Hmm, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps parameterize p and q in terms of an angle?\n\nSince p and q satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, they can be represented as p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2 (since p and q are positive). Then, the equation becomes:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 = 1.\n\nSo, substituting x and y from point C on AB:\n\n[ (1/2)(1 - t) ] / cos\u03b8 + [ (sqrt(3)/2 t ) ] / sin\u03b8 = 1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n(1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sin\u03b8) = 1.\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\n(1 - t)/cos\u03b8 + (sqrt(3) t)/sin\u03b8 = 2.\n\nWe need this equation to hold for \u03b8 such that cos\u03b8 = p and sin\u03b8 = q for some segment PQ. The point C is on PQ if there exists a \u03b8 (other than the one corresponding to AB) such that the above equation is satisfied. The point C we want is such that the only \u03b8 satisfying this is the one for AB. Let me see what \u03b8 corresponds to AB.\n\nFor AB, p = 1/2, q = sqrt(3)/2, so cos\u03b8 = 1/2, so \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 (60 degrees). Therefore, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2. So, the angle \u03b8 for AB is \u03c0/3. So, for our desired point C, the equation above must only have \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 as a solution. Therefore, the equation:\n\n(1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sin\u03b8) = 1,\n\nmust have \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 as its only solution for \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2). So, to find t such that this equation only holds at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, we can consider this as an equation in \u03b8 and set up that it has a double root at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, so that it's tangent there?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider the equation in \u03b8 and set its derivative to zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 so that it has a double root. Hmm, perhaps.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of this equation as:\n\nLet me denote the left-hand side as f(\u03b8, t) = (1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sin\u03b8).\n\nWe want f(\u03b8, t) = 1, and we want this equation to have only one solution \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 for the given t. To ensure that, we can require that \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 is a solution, and that the function f(\u03b8, t) - 1 has a double root at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, so that the equation is tangent there, so that there's only one solution. That might be the way.\n\nTherefore, if we set up that f(\u03b8, t) - 1 has a double root at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, then that would mean that not only f(\u03b8, t) -1 =0 at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, but also the derivative with respect to \u03b8 is zero there. So, let's do that.\n\nFirst, compute f(\u03c0/3, t) must equal 1. Let's check that:\n\nf(\u03c0/3, t) = (1 - t)/(2 * cos(\u03c0/3)) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 * sin(\u03c0/3)).\n\nWe know cos(\u03c0/3) = 1/2, sin(\u03c0/3) = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore:\n\nFirst term: (1 - t)/(2*(1/2)) = (1 - t)/1 = (1 - t).\n\nSecond term: (sqrt(3) t)/(2*(sqrt(3)/2)) = (sqrt(3) t)/(sqrt(3)) = t.\n\nSo, f(\u03c0/3, t) = (1 - t) + t = 1. So that checks out, as expected.\n\nNow, to have a double root at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, the derivative of f(\u03b8, t) with respect to \u03b8 must also be zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3. Let's compute the derivative.\n\nFirst, let me write f(\u03b8, t):\n\nf(\u03b8, t) = (1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8) + (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sin\u03b8).\n\nCompute derivative f\u2019(\u03b8, t):\n\nFirst term derivative: d/d\u03b8 [ (1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8) ] = (1 - t)/(2) * sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 ?\n\nWait, let me compute it step by step. Let me denote the first term as A = (1 - t)/(2 cos\u03b8). Then,\n\ndA/d\u03b8 = (1 - t)/2 * d/d\u03b8 (1/cos\u03b8) = (1 - t)/2 * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nSimilarly, the second term B = (sqrt(3) t)/(2 sin\u03b8).\n\ndB/d\u03b8 = (sqrt(3) t)/2 * d/d\u03b8 (1/sin\u03b8) = (sqrt(3) t)/2 * (-cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nTherefore, the derivative f\u2019(\u03b8, t) = dA/d\u03b8 + dB/d\u03b8:\n\n= (1 - t)/2 * (sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8) - (sqrt(3) t)/2 * (cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nWe need this derivative to be zero at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3.\n\nLet me compute f\u2019(\u03c0/3, t):\n\nFirst, compute cos(\u03c0/3) = 1/2, sin(\u03c0/3) = sqrt(3)/2, so cos\u03b8 = 1/2, sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlugging into f\u2019:\n\nFirst term:\n\n(1 - t)/2 * ( (sqrt(3)/2) / ( (1/2)^2 ) )\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nFirst term numerator: sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2,\n\nDenominator: cos\u00b2\u03b8 = (1/2)^2 = 1/4,\n\nSo sin\u03b8 / cos\u00b2\u03b8 = (sqrt(3)/2) / (1/4) ) = (sqrt(3)/2) * 4 = 2 sqrt(3).\n\nSo first term becomes (1 - t)/2 * 2 sqrt(3) = (1 - t) sqrt(3).\n\nSecond term:\n\n- (sqrt(3) t)/2 * ( cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 )\n\nCompute cos\u03b8 = 1/2,\n\nsin\u00b2\u03b8 = (sqrt(3)/2)^2 = 3/4,\n\nThus cos\u03b8 / sin\u00b2\u03b8 = (1/2) / (3/4) = (1/2)*(4/3) = 2/3.\n\nTherefore, the second term is - (sqrt(3) t)/2 * (2/3) = - (sqrt(3) t)/2 * 2/3 = - (sqrt(3) t)/3.\n\nPutting together, the derivative at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 is:\n\n(1 - t) sqrt(3) - (sqrt(3) t)/3 = sqrt(3) [ (1 - t) - t/3 ].\n\nSet this equal to zero:\n\nsqrt(3) [ (1 - t) - (t/3) ] = 0.\n\nSince sqrt(3) \u2260 0,\n\n(1 - t) - (t/3) = 0\n\nMultiply through:\n\n1 - t - t/3 = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n1 - ( (3t + t)/3 ) = 1 - (4t)/3 = 0\n\nThus,\n\n1 = (4t)/3 => t = 3/4.\n\nTherefore, when t = 3/4, the derivative at \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 is zero, so the equation f(\u03b8, t) =1 has a double root there, meaning that \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 is the only solution (since it's a double root). Therefore, the point C corresponding to t = 3/4 is the desired point.\n\nTherefore, let's compute the coordinates of C when t = 3/4:\n\nx-coordinate: (1/2)(1 - t) = (1/2)(1 - 3/4) = (1/2)(1/4) = 1/8.\n\ny-coordinate: (sqrt(3)/2)(3/4) = (3 sqrt(3))/8.\n\nTherefore, point C is (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nThen, OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/64) + (9 * 3)/64 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check again.\n\nWait, (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 9 * 3 / 64 = 27/64.\n\nSo, 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, OC squared is 7/16, so p = 7, q =16, which are coprime. So p + q = 23.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm again if this is correct. Let me verify each step again.\n\nFirst, parametrization of AB: with t from 0 to1,\n\nx(t) = (1/2)(1 - t),\n\ny(t) = (sqrt(3)/2) t,\n\nso when t=0, (1/2,0) which is A, and t=1 gives (0, sqrt(3)/2) which is B. Correct.\n\nThen, for the point C on AB, we parametrized with t, and set up the equation for another segment in F passing through C. Then, we considered the equation in terms of \u03b8 (angle parameter) and set up the condition for double root at \u03b8=pi/3, leading to t=3/4. Then, coordinates of C are (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). Then OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3sqrt(3)/8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64 = 28/64 = 7/16. So, 7 + 16 = 23. That seems okay.\n\nWait, but let me check again whether t=3/4 gives the point where only AB passes through it. Let me see.\n\nSuppose t=3/4, so C is (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). Let me see if there's another segment PQ in F passing through this point. Suppose there is another segment, with parameters p and q not equal to (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Let me see if such p and q exist.\n\nWe can set up the equation:\n\nx/p + y/q = 1,\n\nwith p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nand x =1/8, y=3sqrt(3)/8.\n\nSo plugging in:\n\n(1/8)/p + (3sqrt(3)/8)/q = 1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me see if there's another solution besides p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nLet me suppose that p and q are different. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote equation 1: (1)/(8p) + (3 sqrt(3))/(8 q) =1,\n\nEquation 2: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me multiply equation 1 by 8:\n\n1/p + 3 sqrt(3)/q =8.\n\nLet me denote variables as p and q. Let me see if there's another solution.\n\nSuppose p =1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2:\n\n1/(1/2) + 3 sqrt(3)/(sqrt(3)/2) = 2 + 3*2 = 2 +6=8, which works. So that's the known solution.\n\nSuppose there is another solution. Let me assume p \u22601/2.\n\nLet me rearrange equation 1:\n\n1/p =8 - 3 sqrt(3)/q,\n\nso p=1/(8 - 3 sqrt(3)/q).\n\nHmm, perhaps substitution into equation 2 is messy. Alternatively, let me let q = k p, so that q = kp, then equation 2 becomes p\u00b2 +k\u00b2 p\u00b2 =1 => p\u00b2 (1 +k\u00b2)=1 => p=1/sqrt(1 +k\u00b2).\n\nBut maybe that complicates.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that the other solution corresponds to the angle \u03b8 where the equation f(theta, t)=1 has another solution besides theta=pi/3. But earlier, when we set t=3/4, we forced that the equation has a double root at theta=pi/3, so that there is only one solution. Hence, there should be no other solution. Therefore, that point is indeed only on AB. So, this seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7/16, so 7+16=23.\n\nWait, but let me check once more by plugging in numbers. Let me try to see if there is another segment through C.\n\nSuppose someone claims that there is another segment PQ through C with p= something else.\n\nSuppose I pick p=0. Let me see, but p=0 would not be in the first quadrant? Wait, p must be between 0 and1, but p=0 would be the point Q on the y-axis. Similarly, q must be between 0 and1.\n\nAlternatively, pick some p and solve for q.\n\nLet me take p = 1/4. Then, equation 1:\n\n1/(8*(1/4)) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) =1,\n\nWhich is 1/(2) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) =1,\n\nSo 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) = 1 - 1/2 =1/2,\n\nThus, 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) =1/2,\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 q: 3 sqrt(3) =4 q,\n\nThus q= (3 sqrt(3))/4 \u2248 (5.196)/4 \u22481.299, but q must be \u22641, so this is invalid.\n\nAnother p, say p=1/3.\n\nThen equation1:\n\n1/(8*(1/3)) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q)=1,\n\n=> 3/(8) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) =1,\n\n=> 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q) =5/8,\n\nMultiply both sides by 8 q: 3 sqrt(3) =5 q,\n\nq= 3 sqrt(3)/5 \u2248 (5.196)/5\u22481.039, still over 1.\n\nHmm, over 1.\n\nWhat about p= 1/ sqrt(2), which is approx 0.707.\n\nThen, equation1:\n\n1/(8*(1/sqrt(2))) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q)=1,\n\n=> sqrt(2)/8 + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q)=1,\n\nMultiply all terms by 8:\n\nsqrt(2) + 3 sqrt(3)/q =8,\n\nThen 3 sqrt(3)/q =8 - sqrt(2),\n\nThus q= 3 sqrt(3)/(8 - sqrt(2)).\n\nCompute denominator: approx 8 -1.414\u22486.586,\n\nNumerator: 3*1.732\u22485.196,\n\nThus q\u22485.196 /6.586\u22480.789, which is less than 1. So that would be acceptable.\n\nThen, check if p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 \u2248 (0.5)^2 + (0.789)^2 \u22480.25 +0.622\u22480.872, which is less than 1. So that would not satisfy equation2 (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1). Therefore, invalid.\n\nWait, but equation2 requires p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. So even if q is less than1, but p is 1/sqrt(2), then p squared is 0.5, so q squared would need to be 0.5. But in this case, q\u22480.789, which squared is ~0.622, so total 0.5+0.622=1.122>1. So that's invalid. Therefore, that is not a solution.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there is no solution except p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that there is another solution. Let me set up equations.\n\nLet me denote equation1:\n\n1/(8p) + 3 sqrt(3)/(8 q)=1,\n\nand equation2: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me multiply equation1 by 8:\n\n1/p + 3 sqrt(3)/q =8,\n\nLet me denote equation A: 1/p + 3 sqrt(3)/q =8,\n\nEquation B: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me try to solve these equations.\n\nLet me let\u2019s suppose variables p and q. Let me solve equation A for 1/p:\n\n1/p =8 - 3 sqrt(3)/q,\n\nthen p = 1/(8 - 3 sqrt(3)/q).\n\nSubstitute into equation B:\n\n[1/(8 - 3 sqrt(3)/q)]\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nThis seems complicated. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, let me let\u2019s set u =1/p and v=1/q. Then equation A becomes:\n\nu + 3 sqrt(3) v =8,\n\nand equation B becomes:\n\n1/u\u00b2 +1/v\u00b2 =1.\n\nHmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps cross multiplying equation A:\n\nMultiply both sides by p q:\n\nq + 3 sqrt(3) p =8 p q,\n\nSo equation C: 8 p q -3 sqrt(3) p - q =0.\n\nAnd equation B: p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nSo now, equations are:\n\n8 p q -3 sqrt(3) p - q =0,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me try to solve this system.\n\nLet me rearrange equation C: 8 p q - q =3 sqrt(3) p,\n\nFactor q: q(8p -1)= 3 sqrt(3) p,\n\nTherefore, q= [3 sqrt(3) p]/(8p -1).\n\nNow, substitute this into equation B:\n\np\u00b2 + [ (3 sqrt(3) p)/(8p -1) ]\u00b2 =1.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\np\u00b2 + (27 p\u00b2)/(8p -1)^2 =1.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote x = p for simplicity:\n\nx\u00b2 + 27 x\u00b2 / (8x -1)^2 =1.\n\nThis is a quartic equation. Let me see if x=1/2 is a solution:\n\nPlug x=1/2:\n\n(1/4) + 27*(1/4)/( (4 -1)^2 ) = 1/4 + (27/4)/9 = 1/4 + (3/4) = 1, which works.\n\nSo x=1/2 is a solution. Let me see if there is another solution.\n\nLet me let\u2019s set y =8x -1. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote denominator as (8x -1)^2, so:\n\nLet me multiply both sides by (8x -1)^2:\n\nx\u00b2 (8x -1)^2 +27 x\u00b2 = (8x -1)^2.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nx\u00b2 (8x -1)^2 +27 x\u00b2 - (8x -1)^2 =0.\n\nLet me factor (8x -1)^2:\n\n[ x\u00b2 -1 ] (8x -1)^2 +27 x\u00b2 =0.\n\nHmm, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, expand everything.\n\nFirst term: x\u00b2 (8x -1)^2:\n\nFirst compute (8x -1)^2 =64x\u00b2 -16x +1,\n\nMultiply by x\u00b2:\n\n64x^4 -16x^3 +x\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: +27x\u00b2,\n\nThird term: - (64x\u00b2 -16x +1).\n\nThus total:\n\n64x^4 -16x^3 +x\u00b2 +27x\u00b2 -64x\u00b2 +16x -1 =0.\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n64x^4 -16x^3 + (1 +27 -64)x\u00b2 +16x -1 =0,\n\nCompute coefficients:\n\nx^4 term:64,\n\nx^3 term: -16,\n\nx\u00b2 term: (1+27-64)= -36,\n\nx term:+16,\n\nconstant term: -1.\n\nThus equation is:\n\n64x^4 -16x^3 -36x\u00b2 +16x -1 =0.\n\nHmm, quartic equation. Since we know that x=1/2 is a root, let's factor (x -1/2).\n\nLet me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.\n\nLet me write the polynomial as:\n\n64x^4 -16x^3 -36x\u00b2 +16x -1.\n\nLet me use synthetic division with root x=1/2.\n\nThe coefficients are: 64, -16, -36, 16, -1.\n\nDivide by (x -1/2):\n\nBring down 64.\n\nMultiply by 1/2: 32.\n\nAdd to next term: -16 +32=16.\n\nMultiply by 1/2:8.\n\nAdd to next term: -36 +8= -28.\n\nMultiply by1/2: -14.\n\nAdd to next term:16 + (-14)=2.\n\nMultiply by1/2:1.\n\nAdd to last term: -1 +1=0. Perfect.\n\nSo the polynomial factors as (x -1/2)(64x^3 +16x^2 -28x +2).\n\nNow, let's factor the cubic equation 64x\u00b3 +16x\u00b2 -28x +2.\n\nLet me see if x=1/2 is again a root:\n\nPlug in x=1/2:\n\n64*(1/8) +16*(1/4) -28*(1/2) +2 =8 +4 -14 +2=0. Yes, x=1/2 is a root again.\n\nThus, factor out another (x -1/2).\n\nDivide the cubic by (x -1/2):\n\nCoefficients:64, 16, -28, 2.\n\nUsing synthetic division with x=1/2:\n\nBring down 64.\n\nMultiply by1/2:32.\n\nAdd to next term:16 +32=48.\n\nMultiply by1/2:24.\n\nAdd to next term:-28 +24= -4.\n\nMultiply by1/2: -2.\n\nAdd to last term:2 + (-2)=0.\n\nSo the cubic factors as (x -1/2)(64x\u00b2 +48x -4).\n\nThus, the original quartic factors as (x -1/2)^2 (64x\u00b2 +48x -4).\n\nNow, set 64x\u00b2 +48x -4=0,\n\nDivide all terms by4:16x\u00b2 +12x -1=0.\n\nSolutions:\n\nx = [-12 \u00b1 sqrt(144 +64)]/(32)\n\nsqrt(208)=sqrt(16*13)=4 sqrt(13),\n\nThus,\n\nx= [ -12 \u00b14 sqrt(13) ] /32 = [ -3 \u00b1 sqrt(13) ] /8.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=1/2 (double root), and x= [ -3 + sqrt(13) ] /8 and [ -3 - sqrt(13) ] /8.\n\nThe last root is negative since sqrt(13)\u22483.605, so -3 -3.605 \u2248-6.605, divided by8 is still negative, so not in our domain (p>0). The other root: [ -3 + sqrt(13) ] /8 \u2248 (-3 +3.605)/8\u22480.605/8\u22480.0756, which is positive. So that is a possible solution.\n\nThus, there is another solution at x\u22480.0756. Let me check if that gives a valid q.\n\nSo x is p, so p= [ -3 + sqrt(13) ] /8 \u2248 ( -3 +3.6055)/8\u22480.6055/8\u22480.0757.\n\nCompute q from equation C: q= [3 sqrt(3) p]/(8p -1).\n\nPlugging p\u22480.0757:\n\n8p\u22480.6055, so denominator\u22480.6055 -1\u2248-0.3945,\n\nNumerator:3*sqrt(3)*0.0757\u22483*1.732*0.0757\u22480.3945.\n\nTherefore, q\u22480.3945 / (-0.3945)= -1. So q\u2248-1, which is negative. Since q must be positive, this is invalid. Hence, the only valid solution is p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, there is no other segment in F passing through C except AB. Therefore, t=3/4 gives the desired point.\n\nTherefore, OC squared is 7/16, so the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n\n\nGiven points \\( O(0,0) \\), \\( A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) \\), and \\( B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\), we need to find a unique point \\( C \\) on segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) that does not belong to any segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) except \\( \\overline{AB} \\).
