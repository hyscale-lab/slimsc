      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers and their moduli... Alright, let me start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, since |z| = 4, that means the modulus of z is 4. So z can be written in polar form as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write z as 4(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). Hmm, either way. Maybe using polar form will help because the modulus is given.\n\nThe expression we need to analyze is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me see. Since z has modulus 4, then 1/z would have modulus 1/4, right? Because |1/z| = 1/|z| = 1/4. So maybe I can express everything in terms of \u03b8?\n\nLet me try writing z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. Then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Let me substitute that into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nLet me compute each term separately. First term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)*e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, maybe factor out some common terms? Let me see the coefficients:\n\nLooking at the first term: 75 + 117i. Let me see if those numbers have a common factor. 75 and 117: 75 divided by 3 is 25, 117 divided by 3 is 39. So 3*(25 + 39i). Similarly, the second term's coefficients 96 and 144: 96/24 = 4, 144/24 = 6. Wait, 96 and 144 have a common factor of 48? Wait 96 is 48*2, 144 is 48*3. So 48*(2 + 3i). Wait but in the second term, after multiplying by 1/4, it's (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i, which is 12*(2 + 3i). Hmm, so perhaps there's a common factor here?\n\nWait, 75 + 117i is 3*(25 + 39i). Let me check 25 and 39: gcd is 1, so can't reduce further. 24 + 36i is 12*(2 + 3i). Hmm, maybe that's useful? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a complex number and then find its real part. Since we need the real part to be maximized. So let me write the entire expression as A + Bi, and then we need to maximize A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe parametrize z as x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, with x^2 + y^2 = 16 (since |z| =4). Then substitute into the expression and compute the real part. That might be more involved, but perhaps manageable. Let me see.\n\nLet me try that approach first. Let z = x + yi, so x^2 + y^2 = 16. Then 1/z = (x - yi)/(x^2 + y^2) = (x - yi)/16. So (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(x - yi)/16. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i)(x + yi) = 75x + 75yi + 117i x + 117i^2 y. Since i^2 = -1, so that becomes 75x + 75yi + 117xi - 117y. Combining real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 75x - 117y\n\nImaginary part: (75y + 117x)i\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(x - yi)/16. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply numerator: (96)(x) + (96)(-yi) + (144i)(x) + (144i)(-yi)\n\n= 96x - 96yi + 144xi - 144y i^2\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes +144y.\n\nThus, numerator is (96x + 144y) + ( -96y + 144x)i\n\nThen divide by 16:\n\nReal part: (96x + 144y)/16 = 6x + 9y\n\nImaginary part: [(-96y + 144x)/16]i = (-6y + 9x)i\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is:\n\nFirst term real + second term real + i*(first term imaginary + second term imaginary)\n\nSo total real part is:\n\n[75x - 117y + 6x + 9y] = (75x +6x) + (-117y +9y) = 81x - 108y\n\nTotal imaginary part is:\n\n[75y + 117x -6y +9x]i = (75y -6y) + (117x +9x) = (69y + 126x)i\n\nSo the real part of the entire expression is 81x - 108y, and the imaginary part is 69y + 126x. Since we need the real part, our goal is to maximize 81x - 108y, given that x^2 + y^2 = 16.\n\nHmm, so now the problem reduces to maximizing the linear function 81x - 108y subject to x^2 + y^2 = 16. That's a standard optimization problem on a circle. The maximum of a linear function over a circle is achieved at the point where the gradient of the function is in the same direction as the radius vector. Alternatively, using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nRecall that for any vector (a, b) and (x, y), the maximum of ax + by over x^2 + y^2 = r^2 is r*sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Wait, but here the function is 81x - 108y. So, the maximum value would be sqrt(81^2 + (-108)^2) * sqrt(x^2 + y^2). But since x^2 + y^2 = 16, so sqrt(16) =4. Wait, but actually, the maximum of (81x -108y) over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=16 is equal to sqrt(81\u00b2 + 108\u00b2) * 4. Wait, let me recall the exact formula.\n\nThe maximum of ax + by over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 is indeed r * sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Wait, let me verify.\n\nSuppose f(x,y)=ax + by. The maximum of f on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 is r * ||(a,b)||, where ||(a,b)|| is the norm of the vector (a,b). Because the maximum is achieved when (x,y) is in the direction of (a,b). So, yes, the maximum value is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*r.\n\nWait, but in our case, the function is 81x - 108y. So the coefficients are a =81, b = -108. Therefore, the maximum value would be sqrt(81\u00b2 + (-108)^2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). But since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=4. So the maximum is sqrt(81\u00b2 + 108\u00b2)*4.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2). Let's compute 81\u00b2: 81*81=6561, 108\u00b2=11664. Sum is 6561 + 11664 = 18225. sqrt(18225)=135. So sqrt(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2)=135. Therefore the maximum value is 135*4=540. Wait, so the maximum real part is 540? But hold on, is that correct?\n\nWait a second, but let me check the direction. The maximum occurs when the vector (x,y) is in the direction of the vector (a, b), which here is (81, -108). So, the point (x,y) should be a scalar multiple of (81, -108). Since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16, then we can write (x,y) = t*(81, -108), and then t^2*(81\u00b2 + (-108)^2) =16. Therefore t = 4 / sqrt(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2)= 4/135. So then the maximum value is (81x -108y) = (81, -108) \u22c5 (x,y) = (81, -108) \u22c5 t*(81, -108) = t*(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2) = (4/135)*18225 = 4*135 = 540. So yes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem is asking for the real part of the original expression, which is 81x -108y, and we just found that its maximum is 540. Therefore, is the answer 540? Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, hold on, the problem is (75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z. When we converted to real and imaginary parts, we got that the real part is 81x -108y. Then, we need to maximize that over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16, which gives 540. But let me confirm again my calculations because sometimes when I do substitutions, I might have messed up the coefficients.\n\nLet me go back through the steps again:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)z where z =x + yi. So expanding:\n\n75x + 75yi +117i x + 117i^2 y =75x +75yi +117xi -117y. So real part is 75x -117y, imaginary is (75y +117x)i. That seems right.\n\nSecond term: (96 +144i)/z. Since z =x + yi, then 1/z = (x - yi)/ (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = (x - yi)/16. So multiplying numerator:\n\n(96 +144i)(x - yi) =96x -96yi +144i x -144i^2 y =96x -96yi +144xi +144y. Because i^2 y is -y, so -144i^2 y = +144y. So real parts: 96x +144y. Imaginary parts: (-96y +144x)i. Then divide by 16:\n\nReal part: (96x +144y)/16 =6x +9y. Imaginary part: [(-96y +144x)/16]i = (-6y +9x)i. \n\nSo total real part is first term real (75x -117y) + second term real (6x +9y) = 81x -108y. That's correct. The imaginary part is (75y +117x)i + (-6y +9x)i = (75y -6y +117x +9x)i = (69y +126x)i. \n\nSo yes, the real part is indeed 81x -108y, and the maximum over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16 is 540. Hmm, so that would be the answer? Wait, but I feel like 540 is quite a big number, but let me think.\n\nWait, let's see, if z is in the direction of the vector (81, -108), then z would be a complex number x + yi where x = 81t, y = -108t. But since |z|=4, then sqrt( (81t)^2 + (-108t)^2 ) =4. So sqrt(t^2 (81\u00b2 +108\u00b2))=4 => t=4/(sqrt(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2)) =4/135. So z is (81*(4/135), -108*(4/135)) = ( (324)/135, -432/135 ) = ( (324 \u00f7 27)/ (135 \u00f727) )? Wait, simplifying 324/135: divide numerator and denominator by 9: 36/15, then again by 3: 12/5. Wait, 324 divided by 135: 324 \u00f7 135 = 2.4, which is 12/5. Wait 12/5 is 2.4, yes. Similarly, -432/135: 432 \u00f7 135 = 3.2, which is 16/5. So z is (12/5, -16/5) multiplied by 4? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, no, the coordinates are x =81t and y =-108t, where t=4/135. So x =81*(4/135)= (81/135)*4 = (3/5)*4 = 12/5. Similarly y= -108*(4/135)= - (108/135)*4 = - (12/15)*4 = - (4/5)*4 = -16/5. Wait, actually, 108 divided by 135 is 12/15 (divided numerator and denominator by 9), then 12/15 reduces to 4/5. So 4/5 *4 is 16/5? Wait no, 108*(4/135) is (108/135)*4. 108/135 = 12/15 = 4/5. So 4/5 *4 = 16/5. But since it's -108t, it's -16/5. So x=12/5, y=-16/5. Then the modulus squared is (12/5)^2 + (-16/5)^2 = (144 +256)/25 = 400/25 =16, which is correct. So that point is valid.\n\nSo plugging back into 81x -108y: 81*(12/5) -108*(-16/5) = (81*12 +108*16)/5. Let's compute numerator:\n\n81*12: 81*10=810, 81*2=162 \u2192 810+162=972\n\n108*16: 100*16=1600, 8*16=128 \u2192 1600+128=1728\n\nTotal numerator: 972 +1728 = 2700. So 2700/5 =540. So yes, that gives 540. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so that seems to check out. But wait, is there any chance that when I converted the expression into real and imaginary parts, I might have made a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach using complex numbers more directly. Let me see.\n\nLet me think of the expression as (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z. Since |z|=4, then |1/z|=1/4. Let me denote w = z. Then the expression is (75+117i)w + (96+144i)/w. Let me denote A =75+117i and B=96+144i. Then the expression is A w + B /w. Since |w|=4, then |B/w|= |B|/|w|= |B|/4. Hmm, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write this expression in terms of w and 1/w, and then set w =4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/w = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Then:\n\nExpression becomes A*(4e^{i\u03b8}) + B*(1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) =4A e^{i\u03b8} + (B/4) e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me write A =75+117i, so 4A = 300 + 468i. And B/4 =24 +36i.\n\nSo the expression is (300 +468i) e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, perhaps express this in terms of cosine and sine. Let me write e^{i\u03b8}=cos\u03b8 +i sin\u03b8, e^{-i\u03b8}=cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8. Then:\n\nFirst term: (300 +468i)(cos\u03b8 +i sin\u03b8) = 300cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 +468i cos\u03b8 +468i^2 sin\u03b8\n\n=300cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 + i(300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8)\n\nSecond term: (24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8)=24cos\u03b8 -24i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8 -36i^2 sin\u03b8\n\n=24cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 +i( -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8 )\n\nAdding both terms together:\n\nReal parts: [300cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8] + [24cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8] = (300+24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary parts: [300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8] + [ -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8 ] = (300 -24) sin\u03b8 + (468 +36) cos\u03b8 =276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8\n\nTherefore the real part of the entire expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, and the imaginary part is 276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8. Therefore, to maximize the real part, which is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, so that's another way of writing the real part. Let me see if this is equivalent to the previous expression. Since in the previous approach, we had 81x -108y. Let me check with x =4 cos\u03b8 and y=4 sin\u03b8 (since z=4e^{i\u03b8}, so x=4 cos\u03b8, y=4 sin\u03b8). Then 81x -108y =81*(4 cos\u03b8) -108*(4 sin\u03b8)= 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Yes, that's exactly the same. So both approaches agree. Good.\n\nTherefore, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Now, to maximize this expression over \u03b8. The maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, but here it's A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 where A =324, B = -432. Wait, actually, it's 324 cos\u03b8 + (-432) sin\u03b8. So the maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, factor out common terms. 324 and 432: both divisible by 108. 324 \u00f7108=3, 432 \u00f7108=4. So 324 =108*3, 432=108*4. Thus sqrt( (108*3)^2 + (108*4)^2 )=108*sqrt(3\u00b2 +4\u00b2)=108*5=540. So the maximum is 540. Which matches the previous result. So that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is indeed 540. Therefore the answer should be 540. Wait, but let me just check if there is any possible mistake here.\n\nWait, in this second approach, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, so maximum sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2) =540, yes. So that's the same as before. So that seems to confirm it. \n\nAlternatively, another way to see it is that the expression 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 can be written as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude, so R = sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540. So the maximum is R. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but let me think again if there's any hidden constraint or if I made an error in substitution. For example, when I wrote z =4e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, so when I substituted into the expression, that's correct. The coefficients were computed properly, leading to the same real part expression. \n\nAlternatively, in the first approach, using x and y variables, we also arrived at the same conclusion. So both methods lead to 540. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is indeed 540. So I should put that in a box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers and their moduli... Alright, let me start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, since |z| = 4, that means the modulus of z is 4. So z can be written in polar form as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to write z as 4(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). Hmm, either way. Maybe using polar form will help because the modulus is given.\n\nThe expression we need to analyze is (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z. Let me see. Since z has modulus 4, then 1/z would have modulus 1/4, right? Because |1/z| = 1/|z| = 1/4. So maybe I can express everything in terms of \u03b8?\n\nLet me try writing z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. Then 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Let me substitute that into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i) * (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nLet me compute each term separately.

Let me see the coefficients:\n\nLooking at the first term: 75 + 117i. Let me see if those numbers have a common factor. 75 and 117: 75 divided by 3 is 25, 117 divided by 3 is 39. So 3*(25 + 39i). Similarly, the second term's coefficients 96 and 144: 96/24 = 4, 144/24 = 6. Wait, 96 and 144 have a common factor of 48? Wait 96 is 48*2, 144 is 48*3. So 48*(2 + 3i). Wait but in the second term, after multiplying by 1/4, it's (96 + 144i)/4 = 24 + 36i, which is 12*(2 + 3i). Hmm, so perhaps there's a common factor here?\n\nWait, 75 + 117i is 3*(25 + 39i). Let me check 25 and 39: gcd is 1, so can't reduce further. 24 + 36i is 12*(2 + 3i). Hmm, maybe that's useful? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can write the entire expression as a complex number and then find its real part. Since we need the real part to be maximized. So let me write the entire expression as A + Bi, and then we need to maximize A. \n\nAlternatively, maybe parametrize z as x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, with x^2 + y^2 = 16 (since |z| =4). Then substitute into the expression and compute the real part. That might be more involved, but perhaps manageable. Let me see.\n\nLet me try that approach first. Let z = x + yi, so x^2 + y^2 = 16. Then 1/z = (x - yi)/(x^2 + y^2) = (x - yi)/16. So (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(x - yi)/16. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i)(x + yi) = 75x + 75yi + 117i x + 117i^2 y. Since i^2 = -1, so that becomes 75x + 75yi + 117xi - 117y. Combining real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 75x - 117y\n\nImaginary part: (75y + 117x)i\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(x - yi)/16. Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply numerator: (96)(x) + (96)(-yi) + (144i)(x) + (144i)(-yi)\n\n= 96x - 96yi + 144xi - 144y i^2\n\nAgain, i^2 = -1, so the last term becomes +144y.\n\nThus, numerator is (96x + 144y) + ( -96y + 144x)i\n\nThen divide by 16:\n\nReal part: (96x + 144y)/16 = 6x + 9y\n\nImaginary part: [(-96y + 144x)/16]i = (-6y + 9x)i\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is:\n\nFirst term real + second term real + i*(first term imaginary + second term imaginary)\n\nSo total real part is:\n\n[75x - 117y + 6x + 9y] = (75x +6x) + (-117y +9y) = 81x - 108y\n\nTotal imaginary part is:\n\n[75y + 117x -6y +9x]i = (75y -6y) + (117x +9x) = (69y + 126x)i\n\nSo the real part of the entire expression is 81x - 108y, and the imaginary part is 69y + 126x. Since we need the real part, our goal is to maximize 81x - 108y, given that x^2 + y^2 = 16.\n\nHmm, so now the problem reduces to maximizing the linear function 81x - 108y subject to x^2 + y^2 = 16. That's a standard optimization problem on a circle. The maximum of a linear function over a circle is achieved at the point where the gradient of the function is in the same direction as the radius vector. Alternatively, using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\nRecall that for any vector (a, b) and (x, y), the maximum of ax + by over x^2 + y^2 = r^2 is r*sqrt(a^2 + b^2). Wait, but here the function is 81x - 108y. So, the maximum value would be sqrt(81^2 + (-108)^2) * sqrt(x^2 + y^2). But since x^2 + y^2 = 16, so sqrt(16) =4. Wait, but actually, the maximum of (81x -108y) over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=16 is equal to sqrt(81\u00b2 + 108\u00b2) * 4. Wait, let me recall the exact formula.\n\nThe maximum of ax + by over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 is indeed r * sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2). Wait, let me verify.\n\nSuppose f(x,y)=ax + by. The maximum of f on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 is r * ||(a,b)||, where ||(a,b)|| is the norm of the vector (a,b). Because the maximum is achieved when (x,y) is in the direction of (a,b). So, yes, the maximum value is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*r.\n\nWait, but in our case, the function is 81x - 108y. So the coefficients are a =81, b = -108. Therefore, the maximum value would be sqrt(81\u00b2 + (-108)^2) * sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2). But since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16, sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2)=4. So the maximum is sqrt(81\u00b2 + 108\u00b2)*4.\n\nWait, let me compute sqrt(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2). Let's compute 81\u00b2: 81*81=6561, 108\u00b2=11664. Sum is 6561 + 11664 = 18225. sqrt(18225)=135. So sqrt(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2)=135. Therefore the maximum value is 135*4=540. Wait, so the maximum real part is 540? But hold on, is that correct?\n\nWait a second, but let me check the direction. The maximum occurs when the vector (x,y) is in the direction of the vector (a, b), which here is (81, -108). So, the point (x,y) should be a scalar multiple of (81, -108). Since x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16, then we can write (x,y) = t*(81, -108), and then t^2*(81\u00b2 + (-108)^2) =16. Therefore t = 4 / sqrt(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2)= 4/135. So then the maximum value is (81x -108y) = (81, -108) \u22c5 (x,y) = (81, -108) \u22c5 t*(81, -108) = t*(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2) = (4/135)*18225 = 4*135 = 540. So yes, that checks out.\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem is asking for the real part of the original expression, which is 81x -108y, and we just found that its maximum is 540. Therefore, is the answer 540? Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, is there a mistake here?\n\nWait, hold on, the problem is (75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z. When we converted to real and imaginary parts, we got that the real part is 81x -108y. Then, we need to maximize that over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16, which gives 540. But let me confirm again my calculations because sometimes when I do substitutions, I might have messed up the coefficients.\n\nLet me go back through the steps again:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)z where z =x + yi. So expanding:\n\n75x + 75yi +117i x + 117i^2 y =75x +75yi +117xi -117y. So real part is 75x -117y, imaginary is (75y +117x)i. That seems right.\n\nSecond term: (96 +144i)/z. Since z =x + yi, then 1/z = (x - yi)/ (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = (x - yi)/16. So multiplying numerator:\n\n(96 +144i)(x - yi) =96x -96yi +144i x -144i^2 y =96x -96yi +144xi +144y. Because i^2 y is -y, so -144i^2 y = +144y. So real parts: 96x +144y. Imaginary parts: (-96y +144x)i. Then divide by 16:\n\nReal part: (96x +144y)/16 =6x +9y. Imaginary part: [(-96y +144x)/16]i = (-6y +9x)i. \n\nSo total real part is first term real (75x -117y) + second term real (6x +9y) = 81x -108y. That's correct. The imaginary part is (75y +117x)i + (-6y +9x)i = (75y -6y +117x +9x)i = (69y +126x)i. \n\nSo yes, the real part is indeed 81x -108y, and the maximum over x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16 is 540. Hmm, so that would be the answer? Wait, but I feel like 540 is quite a big number, but let me think.\n\nWait, let's see, if z is in the direction of the vector (81, -108), then z would be a complex number x + yi where x = 81t, y = -108t. But since |z|=4, then sqrt( (81t)^2 + (-108t)^2 ) =4. So sqrt(t^2 (81\u00b2 +108\u00b2))=4 => t=4/(sqrt(81\u00b2 +108\u00b2)) =4/135. So z is (81*(4/135), -108*(4/135)) = ( (324)/135, -432/135 ) = ( (324 \u00f7 27)/ (135 \u00f727) )? Wait, simplifying 324/135: divide numerator and denominator by 9: 36/15, then again by 3: 12/5. Wait, 324 divided by 135: 324 \u00f7 135 = 2.4, which is 12/5. Wait 12/5 is 2.4, yes. Similarly, -432/135: 432 \u00f7 135 = 3.2, which is 16/5. So z is (12/5, -16/5) multiplied by 4? Wait, no, wait:\n\nWait, no, the coordinates are x =81t and y =-108t, where t=4/135. So x =81*(4/135)= (81/135)*4 = (3/5)*4 = 12/5. Similarly y= -108*(4/135)= - (108/135)*4 = - (12/15)*4 = - (4/5)*4 = -16/5. Wait, actually, 108 divided by 135 is 12/15 (divided numerator and denominator by 9), then 12/15 reduces to 4/5. So 4/5 *4 is 16/5? Wait no, 108*(4/135) is (108/135)*4. 108/135 = 12/15 = 4/5. So 4/5 *4 = 16/5. But since it's -108t, it's -16/5. So x=12/5, y=-16/5. Then the modulus squared is (12/5)^2 + (-16/5)^2 = (144 +256)/25 = 400/25 =16, which is correct. So that point is valid.\n\nSo plugging back into 81x -108y: 81*(12/5) -108*(-16/5) = (81*12 +108*16)/5. Let's compute numerator:\n\n81*12: 81*10=810, 81*2=162 \u2192 810+162=972\n\n108*16: 100*16=1600, 8*16=128 \u2192 1600+128=1728\n\nTotal numerator: 972 +1728 = 2700. So 2700/5 =540. So yes, that gives 540. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so that seems to check out. But wait, is there any chance that when I converted the expression into real and imaginary parts, I might have made a mistake?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach using complex numbers more directly. Let me see.\n\nLet me think of the expression as (75 +117i)z + (96 +144i)/z. Since |z|=4, then |1/z|=1/4. Let me denote w = z. Then the expression is (75+117i)w + (96+144i)/w. Let me denote A =75+117i and B=96+144i. Then the expression is A w + B /w. Since |w|=4, then |B/w|= |B|/|w|= |B|/4. Hmm, but how does that help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write this expression in terms of w and 1/w, and then set w =4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/w = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Then:\n\nExpression becomes A*(4e^{i\u03b8}) + B*(1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) =4A e^{i\u03b8} + (B/4) e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nLet me write A =75+117i, so 4A = 300 + 468i. And B/4 =24 +36i.\n\nSo the expression is (300 +468i) e^{i\u03b8} + (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, perhaps express this in terms of cosine and sine. Let me write e^{i\u03b8}=cos\u03b8 +i sin\u03b8, e^{-i\u03b8}=cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8. Then:\n\nFirst term: (300 +468i)(cos\u03b8 +i sin\u03b8) = 300cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 +468i cos\u03b8 +468i^2 sin\u03b8\n\n=300cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 + i(300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8)\n\nSecond term: (24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8)=24cos\u03b8 -24i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8 -36i^2 sin\u03b8\n\n=24cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 +i( -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8 )\n\nAdding both terms together:\n\nReal parts: [300cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8] + [24cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8] = (300+24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary parts: [300 sin\u03b8 +468 cos\u03b8] + [ -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8 ] = (300 -24) sin\u03b8 + (468 +36) cos\u03b8 =276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8\n\nTherefore the real part of the entire expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, and the imaginary part is 276 sin\u03b8 +504 cos\u03b8. Therefore, to maximize the real part, which is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8.\n\nHmm, so that's another way of writing the real part. Let me see if this is equivalent to the previous expression. Since in the previous approach, we had 81x -108y. Let me check with x =4 cos\u03b8 and y=4 sin\u03b8 (since z=4e^{i\u03b8}, so x=4 cos\u03b8, y=4 sin\u03b8). Then 81x -108y =81*(4 cos\u03b8) -108*(4 sin\u03b8)= 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Yes, that's exactly the same. So both approaches agree. Good.\n\nTherefore, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Now, to maximize this expression over \u03b8. The maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, but here it's A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 where A =324, B = -432. Wait, actually, it's 324 cos\u03b8 + (-432) sin\u03b8. So the maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, factor out common terms. 324 and 432: both divisible by 108. 324 \u00f7108=3, 432 \u00f7108=4. So 324 =108*3, 432=108*4. Thus sqrt( (108*3)^2 + (108*4)^2 )=108*sqrt(3\u00b2 +4\u00b2)=108*5=540. So the maximum is 540. Which matches the previous result. So that's consistent. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is indeed 540. Therefore the answer should be 540. Wait, but let me just check if there is any possible mistake here.\n\nWait, in this second approach, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, so maximum sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2) =540, yes. So that's the same as before. So that seems to confirm it. \n\nAlternatively, another way to see it is that the expression 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 can be written as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude, so R = sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540. So the maximum is R. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the method, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but let me think again if there's any hidden constraint or if I made an error in substitution. For example, when I wrote z =4e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}, so when I substituted into the expression, that's correct. The coefficients were computed properly, leading to the same real part expression. \n\nAlternatively, in the first approach, using x and y variables, we also arrived at the same conclusion. So both methods lead to 540. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is indeed 540. So I should put that in a box.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n\n\nGiven the problem of finding the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), we start by expressing \\(z\\) in polar form. \n\nLet \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since |z| = 4, I know that z is a complex number lying on a circle with radius 4 in the complex plane. Maybe I can represent z in polar form to make things easier. Let me recall that any complex number z can be written as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That way, its magnitude is 4, which satisfies the condition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using rectangular coordinates? Hmm, but polar coordinates might be better here because of the division by z. Let me stick with polar form. So z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, which means 1/z = (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. \n\nSo substituting z into the expression:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i) * z = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (24 + 36i) * e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n(75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, that's the expression. Now, the problem asks for the real part of this expression, and we need to maximize it. \n\nLet me compute the real part of each term separately. Let's denote the first term as Term1 and the second as Term2.\n\nFirst, Term1: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8}\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply 4 with (75 + 117i): 4*(75) + 4*(117)i = 300 + 468i.\n\nSo Term1 = (300 + 468i) * e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSimilarly, Term2: (24 + 36i) * e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo Term2 = (24 + 36i) * e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nNow, to compute the real parts, I need to expand these terms using Euler's formula. Remember that e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8 and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nLet me compute the real part of Term1:\n\nReal[(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)]\n\nMultiply out the terms:\n\n300*cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nSimplify, remembering that i^2 = -1:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nThe real parts here are 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. The imaginary parts are (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)i. Since we are interested in the real part, we can ignore the imaginary parts for Term1's contribution.\n\nSimilarly, compute the real part of Term2:\n\nReal[(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)]\n\nMultiply out:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nAgain, simplify using i^2 = -1:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nThe real parts here are 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. The imaginary parts are (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)i, which we can ignore for the real part contribution.\n\nTherefore, the total real part of the entire expression is:\n\nReal[Term1 + Term2] = (300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8\n\n-468 sin\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 = (-432 sin\u03b8)\n\nSo the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of the function f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nHmm, okay, so now I need to maximize this expression. Since it's a linear combination of sine and cosine, I can write this as a single sinusoidal function. The maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, but here it's A cos\u03b8 - B sin\u03b8. Let me recall the formula.\n\nIn general, the expression C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 can be written as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6), where R = sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2) and tan\u03c6 = D/C. Alternatively, if it's A cos\u03b8 - B sin\u03b8, then that's equivalent to A cos\u03b8 + (-B) sin\u03b8, so the amplitude would still be sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). So the maximum value is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the maximum of 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8 is sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared:\n\n324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 + 24\u00b2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 = 104400; 104400 + 576 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2:\n\n432^2. Let's see, 400^2 = 160,000; 32^2 = 1,024; and cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 + 32)^2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*32 + 32\u00b2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 = 185,600; 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Let me compute sqrt(291600). Since 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) = 540. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait a second, so that's the maximum value?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm the formula again. The maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is indeed sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). So in this case, since the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, then A = 324, B = -432. So sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = same as sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2), which we calculated as 540. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nBut wait, before I get too confident, let me check if there are any constraints or if I missed something. Let me retrace the steps.\n\nOriginal problem: The expression is (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z with |z|=4. \n\nExpressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z is (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})). Then multiplied through and converted to real parts. The real part came out to 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which has a maximum of 540. That seems right. \n\nWait, but let me check the coefficients again. Let me verify the steps where I calculated the real parts. \n\nFirst term after expanding Term1:\n\n(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). The real part is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. Let me confirm that. \n\nYes, because when you multiply (a + ib)(c + id), the real part is ac - bd. Here, a = 300, b = 468, c = cos\u03b8, d = sin\u03b8. So real part is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. Correct.\n\nThen Term2: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). The real part is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. Let me check that. \n\nAgain, (a + ib)(c + id) where here the second term is (cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) so c = cos\u03b8, d = -sin\u03b8. So real part is a*c - b*d = 24 cos\u03b8 - 36*(-sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. Correct. \n\nTherefore, adding those together gives 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. The coefficients 324 and -432, so sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) = 540. \n\nHmm, seems correct. But let me see if there's another approach, maybe using calculus, just to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, to maximize f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, take derivative and set to zero. \n\nf\u2019(\u03b8) = -324 sin\u03b8 - 432 cos\u03b8. Setting to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 - 432 cos\u03b8 = 0. \n\nSo 324 sin\u03b8 + 432 cos\u03b8 = 0. \n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n324 tan\u03b8 + 432 =0 \u2192 tan\u03b8 = -432/324 = -4/3.333... Wait, 432 divided by 324. Let's compute 432/324: both divisible by 108? 108*4 = 432, 108*3 = 324. So 4/3. So tan\u03b8 = -4/3. \n\nSo \u03b8 is in which quadrant? Let's see. tan\u03b8 = -4/3, so \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant. \n\nWe can write \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3). Let me think. Let's suppose \u03b8 is such that tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Let me consider the angle where cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 correspond to that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at a specific angle. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, since the maximum of f(\u03b8) is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), which is 540 as before, so the calculus approach should give the same. Let me confirm.\n\nIf tan\u03b8 = -4/3, then let me compute sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8. Let me consider a right triangle with opposite side -4, adjacent 3 (but in the appropriate quadrant). Let me think of \u03b8 where tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Let's pick \u03b8 in the fourth quadrant where cos\u03b8 is positive and sin\u03b8 negative. \n\nThen, hypotenuse is sqrt(3\u00b2 +4\u00b2)=5. Therefore, cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5. Alternatively, in the second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 =4/5. \n\nWait, but let me plug into the derivative equation. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we take \u03b8 where tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Let's take \u03b8 in the fourth quadrant, so cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5.\n\nThen plug into f(\u03b8) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 + 1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540. \n\nAlternatively, if \u03b8 is in the second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 =4/5. Then f(\u03b8)=324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540, which is the minimum. \n\nTherefore, the maximum is indeed 540, achieved when \u03b8 is in the fourth quadrant with cos\u03b8 = 3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but let me check another angle just to be safe. Suppose \u03b8 =0, then f(\u03b8)=324*1 -432*0=324. \n\n\u03b8= \u03c0/2, then f(\u03b8)=324*0 -432*1= -432. \n\n\u03b8=\u03c0, f(\u03b8)= -324 -0 = -324.\n\n\u03b8= 3\u03c0/2, f(\u03b8)=0 -432*(-1)= 432. \n\nSo, the maximum at \u03b8 where tan\u03b8=-4/3 gives 540, which is higher than those. So that seems okay. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 540. \n\nBut hold on a second, let me think again if there was a mistake in substitution. Let me verify the coefficients again step by step. \n\nOriginal expression:\n\n(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z.\n\nExpressed with z =4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. \n\nFirst term: (75+117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = (75*4 + 117*4 i) e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nTherefore, adding those terms:\n\n(300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nThen, taking the real part of each term. \n\nFirst term's real part: Re[(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)]\n\nWhich is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. \n\nSecond term's real part: Re[(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)]\n\nWhich is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. \n\nAdding them gives 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the maximum is indeed sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that the maximum could be higher due to some cross terms or something else? Hmm, perhaps not. Since when you have an expression of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, the maximum is indeed sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Since in this case, the expression is linear in cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, there's no cross terms or anything complicating it. So the maximum is definitely 540. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to parametrize z? Let me see. Suppose I write z = x + yi where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 16 (since |z|=4). Then plug into the expression and compute the real part. But that might be more complicated, but let's try it for verification.\n\nLet me let z = x + yi, so |z|\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16. Then 1/z = (x - yi)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = (x - yi)/16.\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n(75 +117i)(x + yi) + (96 +144i)*(x - yi)/16\n\nFirst compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (75x - 117y) + i(75y + 117x)\n\nSecond term: [(96x +144y) + i(144x -96y)] /16\n\nWait, let me compute (96 +144i)(x - yi):\n\nMultiply out:\n\n96x -96 yi +144i x -144i^2 y\n\n=96x -96yi +144i x +144 y\n\nBecause i^2 = -1, so -144i^2 y = +144 y.\n\nTherefore, grouping real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal: 96x +144y\n\nImaginary: (-96y +144x)i\n\nTherefore, the second term is [96x +144y + i(144x -96y)] divided by 16.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is:\n\nFirst term real: 75x -117y\n\nFirst term imaginary:75y +117x\n\nSecond term real: (96x +144y)/16\n\nSecond term imaginary: (144x -96y)/16 *i\n\nTherefore, combining real parts:\n\nReal part total = (75x -117y) + (96x +144y)/16\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 75x -117y + (96x)/16 + (144y)/16\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n96x /16 = 6x\n\n144y /16 = 9y\n\nTherefore, Real part = 75x -117y +6x +9y = (75x +6x) + (-117y +9y) =81x -108y\n\nHmm, so according to this, the real part is 81x -108y. Wait a second, but earlier using polar coordinates I had 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nHmm, that's different. Wait, so now there is a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, hold on, this is concerning. Let me check again.\n\nWait in the rectangular coordinates approach, I get Real part as 81x -108y, but in the polar coordinates approach, it was 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nHmm. Since x = 4 cos\u03b8, y =4 sin\u03b8, then substituting into 81x -108y gives 81*(4 cos\u03b8) -108*(4 sin\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Which matches the previous result. So that's consistent. Therefore, both approaches agree. \n\nTherefore, the real part is indeed 81x -108y, with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16. So to maximize 81x -108y subject to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16. \n\nAlternatively, this is a constrained optimization problem. To maximize the linear function 81x -108y on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16. The maximum is the norm of the vector (81, -108) times the radius. Since the maximum of ax + by on the circle of radius r is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*r. \n\nWait, yes, exactly. The maximum value of ax + by with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*r. \n\nHere, a =81, b = -108, and r =4. Therefore, maximum value is sqrt(81\u00b2 + (-108)^2)*4. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst compute 81 squared: 81*81 = 6561.\n\n108 squared: 108*108 = 11664.\n\nSo sqrt(6561 +11664) = sqrt(18225). Hmm, sqrt(18225). Let's see, 135^2 is 18225 (since 125^2=15625, 130^2=16900, 135^2 = (130 +5)^2 = 130\u00b2 + 2*130*5 +5\u00b2=16900 +1300 +25= 18225). \n\nTherefore sqrt(18225)=135. Then multiply by 4 gives 135*4=540. \n\nSame result! So that confirms it again. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 540. \n\nWait, so both approaches agree. That's reassuring. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: since the expression is linear in z and 1/z, perhaps there's a way to write it as a function and use Lagrange multipliers? But since we already did the constrained optimization, maybe that's overkill, but let's try.\n\nWe need to maximize 81x -108y subject to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16. \n\nSet up Lagrangian: L =81x -108y - \u03bb(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -16). Take partial derivatives:\n\ndL/dx =81 - 2\u03bbx =0 \u2192 81=2\u03bbx\n\ndL/dy =-108 -2\u03bby =0 \u2192 -108=2\u03bby\n\ndL/d\u03bb = -(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -16)=0 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=16\n\nFrom the first equation, \u03bb =81/(2x)\n\nFrom the second equation, \u03bb = -108/(2y)= -54/y\n\nTherefore, set equal: 81/(2x) = -54/y \u2192 cross multiply:\n\n81 y = -54*2x \u2192 81y = -108x \u2192 divide both sides by 27: 3y = -4x \u2192 y= - (4/3)x\n\nSo substituting into the constraint x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16:\n\nx\u00b2 + (16/9)x\u00b2 =16 \u2192 (25/9)x\u00b2 =16 \u2192 x\u00b2 = (16)*(9/25)= (144)/25 \u2192 x= \u00b112/5\n\nTherefore, x=12/5 or x= -12/5. \n\nThen y = -4/3 x \u2192 if x=12/5, then y= -16/5; if x= -12/5, then y=16/5.\n\nNow compute the real part at these points:\n\nFor x=12/5, y= -16/5:\n\nReal part =81*(12/5) -108*(-16/5)= (972/5) + (1728/5)= (2700)/5=540\n\nFor x=-12/5, y=16/5:\n\nReal part =81*(-12/5) -108*(16/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5)= (-2700)/5= -540\n\nTherefore, maximum is indeed 540. \n\nTherefore, no matter which method I use, I get 540 as the maximum real part. \n\nSo I think that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 540. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers can be tricky, but let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since |z| = 4, I know that z is a complex number lying on a circle with radius 4 in the complex plane. Maybe I can represent z in polar form to make things easier. Let me recall that any complex number z can be written as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That way, its magnitude is 4, which satisfies the condition. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using rectangular coordinates? Hmm, but polar coordinates might be better here because of the division by z. Let me stick with polar form. So z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, which means 1/z = (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. \n\nSo substituting z into the expression:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i) * z = (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i) * (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (24 + 36i) * e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n(75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, that's the expression. Now, the problem asks for the real part of this expression, and we need to maximize it. \n\nLet me compute the real part of each term separately. Let's denote the first term as Term1 and the second as Term2.\n\nFirst, Term1: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8}\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, multiply 4 with (75 + 117i): 4*(75) + 4*(117)i = 300 + 468i.\n\nSo Term1 = (300 + 468i) * e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSimilarly, Term2: (24 + 36i) * e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo Term2 = (24 + 36i) * e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nNow, to compute the real parts, I need to expand these terms using Euler's formula. Remember that e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8 and e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8.\n\nLet me compute the real part of Term1:\n\nReal[(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)]\n\nMultiply out the terms:\n\n300*cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nSimplify, remembering that i^2 = -1:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nThe real parts here are 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. The imaginary parts are (300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)i. Since we are interested in the real part, we can ignore the imaginary parts for Term1's contribution.\n\nSimilarly, compute the real part of Term2:\n\nReal[(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)]\n\nMultiply out:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nAgain, simplify using i^2 = -1:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nThe real parts here are 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. The imaginary parts are (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)i, which we can ignore for the real part contribution.\n\nTherefore, the total real part of the entire expression is:\n\nReal[Term1 + Term2] = (300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8\n\n-468 sin\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 = (-432 sin\u03b8)\n\nSo the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of the function f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nHmm, okay, so now I need to maximize this expression. Since it's a linear combination of sine and cosine, I can write this as a single sinusoidal function. The maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, but here it's A cos\u03b8 - B sin\u03b8. Let me recall the formula.\n\nIn general, the expression C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 can be written as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6), where R = sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2) and tan\u03c6 = D/C. Alternatively, if it's A cos\u03b8 - B sin\u03b8, then that's equivalent to A cos\u03b8 + (-B) sin\u03b8, so the amplitude would still be sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). So the maximum value is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the maximum of 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8 is sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared:\n\n324^2 = (300 + 24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 + 24\u00b2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 90000 + 14400 = 104400; 104400 + 576 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432^2:\n\n432^2. Let's see, 400^2 = 160,000; 32^2 = 1,024; and cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 + 32)^2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*32 + 32\u00b2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 160,000 +25,600 = 185,600; 185,600 + 1,024 = 186,624.\n\nTherefore, sqrt(104,976 + 186,624) = sqrt(291,600). Let me compute sqrt(291600). Since 540^2 = (500 + 40)^2 = 250,000 + 40,000 + 1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600) = 540. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540.\n\nWait a second, so that's the maximum value?\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me confirm the formula again. The maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is indeed sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). So in this case, since the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, then A = 324, B = -432. So sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = same as sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2), which we calculated as 540. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nBut wait, before I get too confident, let me check if there are any constraints or if I missed something. Let me retrace the steps.\n\nOriginal problem: The expression is (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z with |z|=4. \n\nExpressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z is (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})). Then multiplied through and converted to real parts. The real part came out to 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which has a maximum of 540. That seems right. \n\nWait, but let me check the coefficients again. Let me verify the steps where I calculated the real parts. \n\nFirst term after expanding Term1:\n\n(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). The real part is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. Let me confirm that. \n\nYes, because when you multiply (a + ib)(c + id), the real part is ac - bd. Here, a = 300, b = 468, c = cos\u03b8, d = sin\u03b8. So real part is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. Correct.\n\nThen Term2: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). The real part is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. Let me check that. \n\nAgain, (a + ib)(c + id) where here the second term is (cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) so c = cos\u03b8, d = -sin\u03b8. So real part is a*c - b*d = 24 cos\u03b8 - 36*(-sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. Correct. \n\nTherefore, adding those together gives 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. The coefficients 324 and -432, so sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) = 540. \n\nHmm, seems correct. But let me see if there's another approach, maybe using calculus, just to confirm. \n\nAlternatively, to maximize f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, take derivative and set to zero. \n\nf\u2019(\u03b8) = -324 sin\u03b8 - 432 cos\u03b8. Setting to zero: -324 sin\u03b8 - 432 cos\u03b8 = 0. \n\nSo 324 sin\u03b8 + 432 cos\u03b8 = 0. \n\nDivide both sides by cos\u03b8 (assuming cos\u03b8 \u22600):\n\n324 tan\u03b8 + 432 =0 \u2192 tan\u03b8 = -432/324 = -4/3.333... Wait, 432 divided by 324. Let's compute 432/324: both divisible by 108? 108*4 = 432, 108*3 = 324. So 4/3. So tan\u03b8 = -4/3. \n\nSo \u03b8 is in which quadrant? Let's see. tan\u03b8 = -4/3, so \u03b8 is in the second or fourth quadrant. \n\nWe can write \u03b8 = arctan(-4/3). Let me think. Let's suppose \u03b8 is such that tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Let me consider the angle where cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 correspond to that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at a specific angle. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, since the maximum of f(\u03b8) is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), which is 540 as before, so the calculus approach should give the same. Let me confirm.\n\nIf tan\u03b8 = -4/3, then let me compute sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8. Let me consider a right triangle with opposite side -4, adjacent 3 (but in the appropriate quadrant). Let me think of \u03b8 where tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Let's pick \u03b8 in the fourth quadrant where cos\u03b8 is positive and sin\u03b8 negative. \n\nThen, hypotenuse is sqrt(3\u00b2 +4\u00b2)=5. Therefore, cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5. Alternatively, in the second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 =4/5. \n\nWait, but let me plug into the derivative equation. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we take \u03b8 where tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Let's take \u03b8 in the fourth quadrant, so cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5.\n\nThen plug into f(\u03b8) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 + 1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540. \n\nAlternatively, if \u03b8 is in the second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 =4/5. Then f(\u03b8)=324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540, which is the minimum. \n\nTherefore, the maximum is indeed 540, achieved when \u03b8 is in the fourth quadrant with cos\u03b8 = 3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but let me check another angle just to be safe. Suppose \u03b8 =0, then f(\u03b8)=324*1 -432*0=324. \n\n\u03b8= \u03c0/2, then f(\u03b8)=324*0 -432*1= -432. \n\n\u03b8=\u03c0, f(\u03b8)= -324 -0 = -324.\n\n\u03b8= 3\u03c0/2, f(\u03b8)=0 -432*(-1)= 432. \n\nSo, the maximum at \u03b8 where tan\u03b8=-4/3 gives 540, which is higher than those. So that seems okay. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 540. \n\nBut hold on a second, let me think again if there was a mistake in substitution. Let me verify the coefficients again step by step. \n\nOriginal expression:\n\n(75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z.\n\nExpressed with z =4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. \n\nFirst term: (75+117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = (75*4 + 117*4 i) e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nTherefore, adding those terms:\n\n(300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nThen, taking the real part of each term. \n\nFirst term's real part: Re[(300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)]\n\nWhich is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. \n\nSecond term's real part: Re[(24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)]\n\nWhich is 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. \n\nAdding them gives 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the maximum is indeed sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540. \n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any possibility that the maximum could be higher due to some cross terms or something else? Hmm, perhaps not. Since when you have an expression of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, the maximum is indeed sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Since in this case, the expression is linear in cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, there's no cross terms or anything complicating it. So the maximum is definitely 540. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different way to parametrize z? Let me see. Suppose I write z = x + yi where x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 16 (since |z|=4). Then plug into the expression and compute the real part. But that might be more complicated, but let's try it for verification.\n\nLet me let z = x + yi, so |z|\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16. Then 1/z = (x - yi)/(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = (x - yi)/16.\n\nSo the expression becomes:\n\n(75 +117i)(x + yi) + (96 +144i)*(x - yi)/16\n\nFirst compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (75x - 117y) + i(75y + 117x)\n\nSecond term: [(96x +144y) + i(144x -96y)] /16\n\nWait, let me compute (96 +144i)(x - yi):\n\nMultiply out:\n\n96x -96 yi +144i x -144i^2 y\n\n=96x -96yi +144i x +144 y\n\nBecause i^2 = -1, so -144i^2 y = +144 y.\n\nTherefore, grouping real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal: 96x +144y\n\nImaginary: (-96y +144x)i\n\nTherefore, the second term is [96x +144y + i(144x -96y)] divided by 16.\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is:\n\nFirst term real: 75x -117y\n\nFirst term imaginary:75y +117x\n\nSecond term real: (96x +144y)/16\n\nSecond term imaginary: (144x -96y)/16 *i\n\nTherefore, combining real parts:\n\nReal part total = (75x -117y) + (96x +144y)/16\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nFirst, 75x -117y + (96x)/16 + (144y)/16\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n96x /16 = 6x\n\n144y /16 = 9y\n\nTherefore, Real part = 75x -117y +6x +9y = (75x +6x) + (-117y +9y) =81x -108y\n\nHmm, so according to this, the real part is 81x -108y. Wait a second, but earlier using polar coordinates I had 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nHmm, that's different. Wait, so now there is a discrepancy here. Which one is correct?\n\nWait, hold on, this is concerning. Let me check again.\n\nWait in the rectangular coordinates approach, I get Real part as 81x -108y, but in the polar coordinates approach, it was 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nHmm. Since x = 4 cos\u03b8, y =4 sin\u03b8, then substituting into 81x -108y gives 81*(4 cos\u03b8) -108*(4 sin\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Which matches the previous result. So that's consistent. Therefore, both approaches agree. \n\nTherefore, the real part is indeed 81x -108y, with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16. So to maximize 81x -108y subject to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16. \n\nAlternatively, this is a constrained optimization problem. To maximize the linear function 81x -108y on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16. The maximum is the norm of the vector (81, -108) times the radius. Since the maximum of ax + by on the circle of radius r is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*r. \n\nWait, yes, exactly. The maximum value of ax + by with x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = r\u00b2 is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2)*r. \n\nHere, a =81, b = -108, and r =4. Therefore, maximum value is sqrt(81\u00b2 + (-108)^2)*4. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst compute 81 squared: 81*81 = 6561.\n\n108 squared: 108*108 = 11664.\n\nSo sqrt(6561 +11664) = sqrt(18225). Hmm, sqrt(18225). Let's see, 135^2 is 18225 (since 125^2=15625, 130^2=16900, 135^2 = (130 +5)^2 = 130\u00b2 + 2*130*5 +5\u00b2=16900 +1300 +25= 18225). \n\nTherefore sqrt(18225)=135. Then multiply by 4 gives 135*4=540. \n\nSame result! So that confirms it again. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 540. \n\nWait, so both approaches agree. That's reassuring. \n\nAlternatively, another way to think about it: since the expression is linear in z and 1/z, perhaps there's a way to write it as a function and use Lagrange multipliers? But since we already did the constrained optimization, maybe that's overkill, but let's try.\n\nWe need to maximize 81x -108y subject to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16. \n\nSet up Lagrangian: L =81x -108y - \u03bb(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -16). Take partial derivatives:\n\ndL/dx =81 - 2\u03bbx =0 \u2192 81=2\u03bbx\n\ndL/dy =-108 -2\u03bby =0 \u2192 -108=2\u03bby\n\ndL/d\u03bb = -(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -16)=0 \u2192 x\u00b2 + y\u00b2=16\n\nFrom the first equation, \u03bb =81/(2x)\n\nFrom the second equation, \u03bb = -108/(2y)= -54/y\n\nTherefore, set equal: 81/(2x) = -54/y \u2192 cross multiply:\n\n81 y = -54*2x \u2192 81y = -108x \u2192 divide both sides by 27: 3y = -4x \u2192 y= - (4/3)x\n\nSo substituting into the constraint x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =16:\n\nx\u00b2 + (16/9)x\u00b2 =16 \u2192 (25/9)x\u00b2 =16 \u2192 x\u00b2 = (16)*(9/25)= (144)/25 \u2192 x= \u00b112/5\n\nTherefore, x=12/5 or x= -12/5. \n\nThen y = -4/3 x \u2192 if x=12/5, then y= -16/5; if x= -12/5, then y=16/5.\n\nNow compute the real part at these points:\n\nFor x=12/5, y= -16/5:\n\nReal part =81*(12/5) -108*(-16/5)= (972/5) + (1728/5)= (2700)/5=540\n\nFor x=-12/5, y=16/5:\n\nReal part =81*(-12/5) -108*(16/5)= (-972/5) - (1728/5)= (-2700)/5= -540\n\nTherefore, maximum is indeed 540. \n\nTherefore, no matter which method I use, I get 540 as the maximum real part. \n\nSo I think that's solid. Therefore, the answer is 540. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), we start by expressing \\(z\\) in polar form.
