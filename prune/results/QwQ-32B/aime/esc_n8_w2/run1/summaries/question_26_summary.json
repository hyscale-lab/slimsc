      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand everything. \n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle \u03c9 again at point P. The sides of the triangle are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. \n\nAlright, let me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then line AD meets the circle again at P. So AP is the segment from A to P along AD. \n\nHmm, tangents from a common point D to a circle are equal in length. So DB = DC because they're both tangents from D to the circle \u03c9. That might be useful. Also, point D is the exsymmedian or something? Maybe not, but perhaps I can use properties of pole and polar lines here. \n\nAlternatively, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC? Wait, the symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector. Hmm, not sure if that's directly applicable here. Let me recall that the polar of point D with respect to the circle \u03c9 would be line BC, since the tangents from D touch at B and C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using power of a point. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DB^2 = DC^2. Also, since AD passes through P, then AP * AD = power of A with respect to \u03c9? Wait, no. Wait, A is on the circle, so the power of A is zero. Hmm, perhaps I need to use power of point D. \n\nPower of D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. Because AD passes through P, so DP * DA = power of D. Wait, but P is on the circle, so DP * DA would be equal to the power of D with respect to \u03c9. \n\nWait, let me recall the power of a point formula: For a point D outside a circle, the power is equal to the square of the tangent from D to the circle. So, Power of D = DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. \n\nTherefore, DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. \n\nSo, if I can find DB and DA, then I can relate them. Alternatively, maybe express DP as DA - AP? Let's see. Let me denote AP as x, then DP would be DA - AP = DA - x. Wait, but actually, since P is another intersection point, so AD is a line from A through D to P? Wait no, hold on. Wait, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P? Wait, that might not be correct. Wait, actually, the problem says \"AD intersects \u03c9 at P\", so since A is already on \u03c9, then P must be the other intersection point. So the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then exits the circle at P. Wait, but then P would be on the extension of AD beyond D? Wait, but D is outside the circle because it's the intersection of two tangents. So yes, the line AD starts at A, goes through D (outside the circle), and then P is the other intersection point? Wait, but then AP would be from A to P, which is through D. Wait, but in that case, the length AP would be AD + DP? But DP would be from D to P, but since D is outside, then AP would be AD plus DP? Hmm, perhaps. Wait, but let me get this straight. \n\nLet me think of the points: A is on the circle, D is outside, so the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then continues to P, which is another point on the circle. Wait, but that would mean that P is on the opposite side of D from A. Wait, but then the length AP would be AD + DP. However, since D is the intersection of the tangents, maybe the order is different. Alternatively, maybe the line AD goes from A through D, and then P is on the other side of D. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the configuration. \n\nAlternatively, maybe P is between A and D? But since A is on the circle, and D is outside, then if we go from A towards D, which is outside, the other intersection point would be beyond D. So AP would be AD + DP, but since we are going from A through D to P, so AP = AD + DP. Wait, but then DP would be the segment from D to P, so AP is AD + DP. But in terms of power of a point, Power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. \n\nWait, if DP is the segment from D to P, then DA is the length from D to A, so DA = AD? Wait, DA is the same as AD. Wait, but in power of a point, it's DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, DP * DA = DB\u00b2. \n\nSo, if I let AP = x, then since AP is from A to P, and P is beyond D from A, then AP = AD + DP. Let me denote AD as y, so DP = AP - AD = x - y? Wait, but that might complicate. Alternatively, let me set variables properly. \n\nLet me denote AP = t, then since P is on AD beyond D, the length from A to D is AD, and from D to P is DP, so AP = AD + DP. Therefore, DP = AP - AD = t - AD. \n\nBut according to power of point D: DP * DA = DB\u00b2. \n\nWait, DP is the segment from D to P, and DA is from D to A? Wait, no, DA is from D to A. Wait, in the power of a point formula, for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the two intersections with the line. So, if line DP intersects the circle at A and P, then DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but actually, the power of D is equal to DA * DP, since A and P are the two points where line AD intersects the circle. \n\nYes, exactly. The power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nSo, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, if I can find DA and DB, I can relate them. But perhaps I need to express AP in terms of DA and DP. Since AP = AD + DP (if P is beyond D), but in terms of DA and DP: Let me clarify the notation. Let me let AD be the length from A to D, then DP is the length from D to P. Since P is on the line beyond D from A, then AP = AD + DP. \n\nTherefore, DP = AP - AD. \n\nSo, substituting into the power equation: DA * DP = DA*(AP - DA) = DB\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, DA*(AP - DA) = DB\u00b2. \n\nLet me write that as: DA * AP - DA\u00b2 = DB\u00b2 \n\nSo, DA * AP = DA\u00b2 + DB\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, AP = (DA\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/DA \n\nHmm, but I don't know DA or DB yet. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find coordinates? Let me think. Maybe coordinate geometry would be a good approach here. Let me try that. \n\nFirst, let me set up coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations, since AC is 10 and BC is 9. Let me denote coordinates as follows: Let me let point C be (0,0). Let me put point B somewhere on the x-axis? Wait, but then AC is 10. Wait, perhaps place points such that calculations are easier. \n\nAlternatively, let me use coordinates with triangle ABC. Let me denote coordinates for triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me use the coordinate system with point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC=9. Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute coordinates of point A. \n\nGiven that AC = 10 and AB =5, so coordinates of A must satisfy distance from C(0,0) to A(x,y) is 10, and distance from B(9,0) to A(x,y) is 5. \n\nSo, equations: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 = 100 \n\nand \n\n(x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 =25 \n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x -9)^2 + y\u00b2] = 100 -25 \n\nExpand: x\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 -18x +81) =75 \n\nSimplify: 18x -81 =75 \n\n18x = 75 +81 =156 \n\nx = 156/18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666... \n\nThen, plug x back into first equation: \n\n(26/3)^2 + y\u00b2 = 100 \n\nCalculate (26/3)^2: 676/9 \n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 100 - 676/9 = (900 - 676)/9 = 224/9 \n\nThus, y = \u00b1\u221a(224/9) = \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3 \n\nHmm, okay. Let me take y positive, so point A is at (26/3, 4\u221a14/3). \n\nSo coordinates: \n\nC is (0,0), B is (9,0), A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3). \n\nNow, I need to find the coordinates of point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. \n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can compute the circumcircle. \n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for three points, we can find the equation of the circle. \n\nLet me denote the general equation of a circle as: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 \n\nPlugging in points A, B, C: \n\nFor point C (0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0 \n\nWait, but that would mean the circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0. \n\nBut point B is (9,0): \n\n9\u00b2 +0 + D*9 + E*0 =0 \u21d2 81 +9D =0 \u21d2 9D = -81 \u21d2 D= -9 \n\nThen, point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3): \n\n(26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0 \n\nPlugging D = -9: \n\n(676/9) + (16*14)/9 + (-9)*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0 \n\nCompute each term: \n\nFirst term: 676/9 \n\nSecond term: (224)/9 \n\nThird term: -9*(26/3) = - (234)/3 = -78 \n\nFourth term: (4\u221a14/3) E \n\nSo adding first two terms: (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100 \n\nSo total equation: 100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 \n\nThus, 22 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14/3) E = -22 \u21d2 E = (-22)*(3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14) \n\nRationalizing the denominator: E = (-33\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-33\u221a14)/28 \n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle is: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + E y =0, with E as above. \n\nThus, the equation is: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0 \n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I made an error in calculation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the term for point A. \n\nFirst term: (26/3)^2 = (26)^2 /9 = 676/9 \n\nSecond term: (4\u221a14/3)^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9 \n\nThird term: D*(26/3) = (-9)*(26/3) = -234/3 = -78 \n\nFourth term: E*(4\u221a14/3) \n\nSo total equation: \n\n676/9 +224/9 -78 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 \n\nAdding first two terms: (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 = 100 \n\nSo 100 -78 =22, so 22 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 \n\nTherefore, solving for E: \n\n(4\u221a14/3) E = -22 \n\nMultiply both sides by 3: 4\u221a14 E = -66 \n\nDivide by 4\u221a14: E = -66/(4\u221a14) = -33/(2\u221a14) \n\nYes, that's correct. So rationalizing gives E = -33\u221a14/(2*14) = -33\u221a14/28. \n\nHmm, okay. So the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is manageable, but maybe there is a better way. Alternatively, maybe using parametric equations for the tangents. \n\nAlternatively, since we need the tangents at B and C. Let me recall that the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. \n\nSo, the tangent at point B (9,0) to the circle \u03c9. The center of the circle is at (D/2, E/2) from the general equation. Wait, in the general equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, the center is (-D/2, -E/2). \n\nSo here, D is -9, E is - (33\u221a14)/28. \n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0, so D is -9, E is - (33\u221a14)/28. Therefore, the center is at (-D/2, -E/2) = (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56). \n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the tangent lines at B and C. \n\nThe tangent at point B (9,0): \n\nThe slope of the radius from center to B is (y_B - y_center)/(x_B - x_center). \n\nCenter is (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56). \n\nSo the slope from center to B (9,0) is (0 - (33\u221a14)/56)/(9 - 9/2) = (-33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) = (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (-33\u221a14)/252 = (-11\u221a14)/84 \n\nTherefore, the tangent line at B is perpendicular to this radius. So its slope is the negative reciprocal. \n\nSlope of tangent at B: m_B = 84/(11\u221a14) \n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Let me rationalize that. \n\nWait, 84 divided by (11\u221a14) is equal to (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11 \n\nWait, because 84 divided by 14 is 6. \n\nYes, so m_B = (84)/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11 \n\nTherefore, the tangent line at B has slope (6\u221a14)/11. \n\nSimilarly, the tangent at point C (0,0). Let me compute that. \n\nThe slope of the radius from center to C (0,0): \n\nCenter is (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56). \n\nSlope is ( (33\u221a14)/56 - 0 ) / (9/2 - 0) = (33\u221a14)/56 / (9/2) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (33\u221a14)/252 = (11\u221a14)/84 \n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to this radius, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: m_C = -84/(11\u221a14) \n\nSimilarly, rationalizing: \n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = - (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = - (6\u221a14)/11 \n\nTherefore, the tangent at C has slope -6\u221a14/11. \n\nNow, equations of the tangent lines: \n\nFor tangent at B (9,0) with slope (6\u221a14)/11: \n\nEquation: y -0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9) \n\nSimilarly, tangent at C (0,0) with slope -6\u221a14/11: \n\nEquation: y -0 = (-6\u221a14/11)(x -0) \u21d2 y = (-6\u221a14/11)x \n\nNow, the point D is the intersection of these two tangent lines. \n\nSo, set the two equations equal: \n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x \n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to simplify: \n\n(x -9) = -x \n\nTherefore, x -9 = -x \u21d2 2x =9 \u21d2 x=9/2 \n\nThen plug back into the equation for the tangent at C: \n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)(9/2) = (-6\u221a14 *9)/(22) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11 \n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) \n\nHmm, okay. Now, we need to find point P, which is the other intersection of line AD with the circle. \n\nFirst, let me find the parametric equation of line AD. \n\nPoints A and D: \n\nPoint A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3) \n\nPoint D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) \n\nLet me compute the vector from A to D: \n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6) \n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) \n\nCompute the terms inside: \n\n-27/11 -4/3 = (-81 -44)/33 = (-125)/33 \n\nTherefore, \u0394y = \u221a14*(-125/33) \n\nThus, the parametric equations for line AD can be written as: \n\nx = 26/3 + t*(-25/6) \n\ny = (4\u221a14)/3 + t*(-125\u221a14)/33 \n\nWe can write this as: \n\nx = 26/3 - (25/6)t \n\ny = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14)/33 t \n\nWe need to find the point P \u2260 A where this line intersects the circle again. \n\nWe can substitute these parametric equations into the circle equation and solve for t. Since point A is already on the circle (t=0), the other solution will correspond to point P. \n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0 \n\nLet me substitute x and y from the parametric equations into this equation. \n\nFirst, compute x\u00b2: \n\n[26/3 - (25/6)t]^2 \n\nSimilarly, y\u00b2: [ (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14)/33 t ]^2 \n\nThen, compute -9x and - (33\u221a14)/28 y \n\nThis seems very algebra-heavy, but let's proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, let me denote t as a parameter. Let me compute each term. \n\nLet me first compute x = 26/3 - (25/6)t \n\nLet me write all terms with denominator 6 for x: \n\nx = (52/6 -25t/6) = (52 -25t)/6 \n\nSimilarly, y = [4\u221a14/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t] \n\nLet me factor out \u221a14: \n\ny = \u221a14 [4/3 - (125/33)t] \n\nLet me write 4/3 as 44/33 to have common denominator: \n\n4/3 = 44/33 \n\nSo y = \u221a14 [44/33 - (125/33)t ] = \u221a14 [ (44 -125t)/33 ] \n\nTherefore, y = \u221a14*(44 -125t)/33 \n\nNow, let's compute each term in the circle equation. \n\nFirst term: x\u00b2 = [ (52 -25t)/6 ]\u00b2 = (52 -25t)^2 / 36 \n\nSecond term: y\u00b2 = [ \u221a14*(44 -125t)/33 ]^2 = 14*(44 -125t)^2 / (33)^2 \n\nThird term: -9x = -9*(52 -25t)/6 = - (9/6)*(52 -25t) = - (3/2)*(52 -25t) \n\nFourth term: - (33\u221a14)/28 * y = - (33\u221a14)/28 * [ \u221a14*(44 -125t)/33 ] \n\nSimplify this term: \n\nThe 33 cancels, \u221a14 * \u221a14 =14, so: \n\n- (14*(44 -125t))/28 = - (44 -125t)/2 \n\nTherefore, putting all terms into the equation: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0 \n\nbecomes \n\n[ (52 -25t)^2 / 36 ] + [14*(44 -125t)^2 / (33)^2 ] - [ (3/2)*(52 -25t) ] - [ (44 -125t)/2 ] =0 \n\nThis is going to be complicated, but let me try to compute term by term. \n\nFirst term: Let me compute (52 -25t)^2: \n\n=52\u00b2 - 2*52*25 t + (25t)^2 = 2704 - 2600t + 625t\u00b2 \n\nSo first term is (2704 -2600t +625t\u00b2)/36 \n\nSecond term: \n\n14*(44 -125t)^2 / 33\u00b2 \n\nFirst compute (44 -125t)^2: \n\n=44\u00b2 - 2*44*125 t + (125t)^2 = 1936 - 11000t + 15625t\u00b2 \n\nMultiply by 14: \n\n14*1936 = 27104 \n\n14*(-11000t) = -154000t \n\n14*(15625t\u00b2) = 218750t\u00b2 \n\nThus, numerator is 27104 -154000t +218750t\u00b2 \n\nDenominator is 33\u00b2=1089 \n\nSo second term: (27104 -154000t +218750t\u00b2)/1089 \n\nThird term: \n\n- (3/2)*(52 -25t) = - (3/2)*52 + (3/2)*25t = -78 + (75/2)t \n\nFourth term: \n\n- (44 -125t)/2 = -22 + (125/2)t \n\nPutting all terms together: \n\nFirst term + Second term + Third term + Fourth term =0 \n\nSo: \n\n[ (2704 -2600t +625t\u00b2)/36 ] + [ (27104 -154000t +218750t\u00b2)/1089 ] + [ -78 + (75/2)t ] + [ -22 + (125/2)t ] =0 \n\nLet me combine the constants, the terms with t, and the t\u00b2 terms. \n\nFirst, let me handle the constants: \n\n-78 -22 = -100 \n\nTerms with t: \n\n(75/2)t + (125/2)t = (200/2)t =100t \n\nTerms with t\u00b2: \n\n625t\u00b2/36 +218750t\u00b2/1089 \n\nTerms from first part: \n\n(2704 -2600t)/36 \n\nWait, actually, wait, the first term has a numerator with constants, t terms, and t\u00b2 terms. Similarly, the second term also. \n\nWait, actually, I think I need to separate each term into their components. \n\nLet me re-express each big term: \n\nFirst big term: \n\n(2704 -2600t +625t\u00b2)/36 \n\n= 2704/36 -2600t/36 +625t\u00b2/36 \n\nSecond big term: \n\n(27104 -154000t +218750t\u00b2)/1089 \n\n=27104/1089 -154000t/1089 +218750t\u00b2/1089 \n\nThird and fourth terms combined: \n\n(-100) +100t \n\nSo, combining all terms: \n\nConstants: 2704/36 +27104/1089 -100 \n\nLinear terms: (-2600/36 -154000/1089 +100 ) t \n\nQuadratic terms: (625/36 +218750/1089) t\u00b2 \n\nSet the entire expression equal to zero. \n\nThis is very tedious. Perhaps I can find a common denominator or see if there's a better approach. Alternatively, maybe there is a property I can use instead of coordinates. \n\nWait, since AP * AD = power of A? Wait, no. Wait, the power of point D is DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. \n\nWait, let me recall that. \n\nPower of D: DB\u00b2 = DP * DA \n\nWe need to find AP. Let me see if I can express AP in terms of DA and DP. \n\nSince P is on line AD beyond D, then AP = AD + DP \n\nBut from power of point: DP * DA = DB\u00b2 \n\nLet me denote AD as x, then DP = DB\u00b2 / x \n\nTherefore, AP = x + (DB\u00b2)/x \n\nWe need to find AP, so if I can compute AD and DB, then I can compute AP. \n\nAlternatively, compute AD and DB using coordinates. \n\nWait, maybe that's a better approach. \n\nWe already have coordinates for points A, D, so let me compute AD first. \n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3) \n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) \n\nCompute distance AD: \n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6) \n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) \n\nConvert to common denominator 33: \n\n-27/11 = -81/33 \n\n-4/3 = -44/33 \n\nTotal: -81 -44 = -125/33 \n\nThus, \u0394y = \u221a14*(-125/33) \n\nTherefore, distance AD is sqrt[(\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2] \n\nCompute (\u0394x)^2: (25/6)^2 = 625/36 \n\n(\u0394y)^2: ( (\u221a14 *125/33)^2 ) Wait, but with the negative sign squared. \n\nSo (\u0394y)^2 = ( (\u221a14 * 125/33 )^2 ) =14*(125/33)^2 \n\nThus, AD squared is 625/36 +14*(125/33)^2 \n\nLet me compute this step by step. \n\nFirst term: 625/36 \n\nSecond term: 14*(125\u00b2)/(33\u00b2) \n\n125 squared is 15625 \n\nSo 14*15625 = 218750 \n\nThus, second term is 218750/(33\u00b2) \n\nSo AD\u00b2 = 625/36 +218750/1089 \n\nTo add these, need a common denominator. Let me compute LCM of 36 and 1089. \n\nFactor 36: 2\u00b2*3\u00b2 \n\nFactor 1089: 33\u00b2 = (3*11)^2 = 3\u00b2*11\u00b2 \n\nThus LCM is 2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2 =4*9*121=4*1089=4356 \n\nConvert each term: \n\n625/36 = (625 * 121)/4356 \n\nBecause 36 *121 =4356 \n\nSimilarly, 218750/1089 = (218750 *4)/4356 \n\nBecause 1089 *4=4356 \n\nCompute numerator: \n\nFirst term: 625 *121 \n\n625 *121: 625*120=75000, plus 625*1=625 \u21d2 total 75625 \n\nSecond term: 218750 *4 = 875000 \n\nThus total numerator:75625 +875000= 950,625 \n\nTherefore, AD\u00b2 = 950625 /4356 \n\nSimplify this fraction: \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9: \n\n950625 \u00f79= 105625 \n\n4356 \u00f79= 484 \n\nSo 105625/484 \n\nCheck if further simplification is possible. \n\n484 is 22\u00b2=4*121=4*11\u00b2 \n\n105625 divided by 11: 105625 \u00f711= 9602.27\u2026 Not integer. \n\nWait, 105625 divided by 25 is 4225, which is 65\u00b2. Hmm. \n\nWait 105625 = 25 * 4225 =25*65\u00b2 \n\n484 =4*121=4*11\u00b2 \n\nSo, 105625/484 = (25*65\u00b2)/(4*11\u00b2) \n\nBut not sure if that helps. \n\nAnyway, AD squared is 105625/484, so AD is sqrt(105625/484)= (325)/22 \n\nWait, sqrt(105625) is 325, sqrt(484)=22. \n\nYes! Because 325\u00b2 = (300+25)^2 =90000 +15000 +625= 105625 \n\n22\u00b2=484. \n\nTherefore, AD = 325/22 \n\nOkay, that's a relief. So AD is 325/22. \n\nNow, need to compute DB. \n\nPoint D is at (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) and point B is at (9,0). \n\nCompute the distance between D and B. \n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) \n\nCoordinates of B: (9, 0) \n\n\u0394x =9 -9/2 =9/2 \n\n\u0394y =0 - (-27\u221a14/11)=27\u221a14/11 \n\nThus, distance DB squared is (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14/11)^2 \n\nCompute each term: \n\n(9/2)^2 =81/4 \n\n(27\u221a14/11)^2 = (27\u00b2)*(14)/(11\u00b2)=729*14/121 \n\n729*14: 700*14=9800, 29*14=406, total 9800+406=10206 \n\nThus, 10206/121 \n\nSo total DB squared is 81/4 +10206/121 \n\nAgain, common denominator needed. \n\nLCM of 4 and 121 is 484 \n\nConvert each term: \n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484 \n\n10206/121= (10206*4)/484 \n\nCompute numerators: \n\n81*121: 81*120=9720 +81*1=81 \u21d2 total 9801 \n\n10206*4=40824 \n\nTotal numerator:9801 +40824 = 50625 \n\nThus DB squared is 50625/484 \n\nTherefore, DB = sqrt(50625/484)=225/22 \n\nBecause sqrt(50625)=225, sqrt(484)=22 \n\nSo DB =225/22 \n\nTherefore, going back to the power of point D: \n\nDB\u00b2 = (225/22)^2 =50625/484 \n\nAnd DA * DP = DB\u00b2 \n\nWe have DA =325/22 \n\nThus, DP = (DB\u00b2)/DA = (50625/484)/(325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325) \n\nSimplify: \n\n50625 divided by 325: let's see. 325*156= 325*(150+6)=48750 +1950=50700. Hmm, 50625 is 50700 -75. So 50625 =325*156 -75. Not sure. Alternatively, factor numerator and denominator. \n\n50625 = 225\u00b2 \n\n325=25*13 \n\n22 and 484: 484=4*121=4*11\u00b2, 22=2*11 \n\nLet me write the fraction as: \n\n(225\u00b2 *22)/(484 *325) \n\n= (225\u00b2 *22)/( (4*121)*(25*13)) \n\nBreakdown denominators and numerators: \n\n225\u00b2 = (15\u00b2)^2=15^4 \n\n22=2*11 \n\n4=2\u00b2 \n\n121=11\u00b2 \n\n25=5\u00b2 \n\n13=13 \n\nSo, numerator: 15^4 *2*11 \n\nDenominator: 2\u00b2 *11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13 \n\nSimplify terms: \n\nCancel 2: numerator has 2, denominator has 2\u00b2 \u21d2 remains 2 in denominator \n\nCancel 11: numerator has 11, denominator has 11\u00b2 \u21d2 remains 11 in denominator \n\nSo now: \n\n(15^4 ) / (2*11*5\u00b2*13) \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nWait, 15^4 is (3*5)^4=3^4*5^4 \n\nSo numerator: 3^4 *5^4 *2*11 \n\nDenominator: 2*11*5\u00b2 *13 *2 (Wait, wait, let me re-express step by step). \n\nWait, numerator: 15^4 *2*11 = (3^4 *5^4)*2*11 \n\nDenominator: 2\u00b2 *11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13 \n\nSo breaking down: \n\nNumerator: 3^4 *5^4 *2 *11 \n\nDenominator: 2\u00b2 *11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13 \n\nCancel common factors: \n\n5^4 /5\u00b2 =5\u00b2 \n\n2/2\u00b2=1/2 \n\n11/11\u00b2=1/11 \n\nThus remaining: \n\n3^4 *5\u00b2 / (2 *11 *13) \n\nCompute numerator: \n\n3^4=81, 5\u00b2=25 \u21d2 81*25=2025 \n\nDenominator: 2*11*13= 286 \n\nThus, DP=2025/286 \n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, numerator after cancellation: \n\n3^4 *5\u00b2 =81 *25=2025 \n\nDenominator: 2*11*13 =2*143=286 \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, DP=2025/286 \n\nWait, but let me check the previous steps again for errors. \n\nWait, so DP = (50625/484)/(325/22) \n\n=50625/484 *22/325 \n\nYes. \n\n50625 divided by 325: 50625 \u00f7325. Let me compute that. \n\n325 \u00d7 155 = 325*(150 +5)= 48750 +1625=50375 \n\n50625 -50375=250 \n\nSo 50625=325\u00d7155 +250 \n\nHmm, not exact. Alternatively, perhaps simplifying the fraction step by step. \n\n50625/484 divided by 325/22 is equal to (50625/484)*(22/325) \n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator: \n\n50625=225\u00b2= (15\u00b2)^2=3^4\u00d75^4 \n\n22=2\u00d711 \n\n484=2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2 \n\n325=5\u00b2\u00d713 \n\nThus, \n\nNumerator: 3^4\u00d75^4 \u00d72\u00d711 \n\nDenominator: 2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d713 \n\nCancel terms: \n\n2 in numerator cancels with one 2 in denominator, leaving 2 in denominator \n\n11 in numerator cancels with one 11 in denominator, leaving 11 in denominator \n\n5^4 /5\u00b2=5\u00b2 \n\nSo remaining numerator:3^4\u00d75\u00b2 \n\nDenominator:2\u00d711\u00d713 \n\nYes, so 3^4\u00d75\u00b2=81\u00d725=2025 \n\nDenominator:2\u00d711\u00d713=286 \n\nThus DP=2025/286 \n\nSimplify this fraction? Let's see if 2025 and 286 have common factors. \n\n286 factors: 2\u00d711\u00d713 \n\n2025 divided by 2? No. 2025 is odd. Divided by 11? 11\u00d7184=2024, so 2025-2024=1 \u21d2 no. Divided by 13? 13\u00d7155=2015, 2025-2015=10 \u21d2 no. So 2025 and 286 are coprime? Wait 2025 is 45\u00b2, which is (9\u00d75)^2, so factors 3^4\u00d75\u00b2. 286 is 2\u00d711\u00d713. So no common factors. So DP=2025/286 \n\nTherefore, going back, AP = AD + DP \n\nAD was 325/22, DP is 2025/286 \n\nConvert to common denominator. Let me compute 325/22 +2025/286 \n\n286 is 13\u00d722. \n\nThus, 325/22 = (325\u00d713)/286 \n\n325\u00d713: 300\u00d713=3900, 25\u00d713=325 \u21d2 total 4225 \n\nThus, 325/22 =4225/286 \n\nThen, adding 2025/286: \n\nTotal AP = (4225 +2025)/286 =6250/286 \n\nSimplify this fraction. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: \n\n6250 \u00f72=3125 \n\n286 \u00f72=143 \n\nSo AP=3125/143 \n\nCheck if this can be reduced. \n\n143 factors:11\u00d713 \n\n3125 is 5^5. 143 is 11\u00d713, neither of which divide 5. So yes, reduced. \n\nTherefore, AP=3125/143, so m=3125 and n=143. \n\nCheck if they are coprime. Since 143=11\u00d713, and 3125 is 5^5. No common factors. So m +n=3125+143=3268. \n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations again because this seems a bit large, and I might have made an arithmetic mistake. \n\nWait, let me check AP = AD + DP. \n\nAD is 325/22 \u224814.7727 \n\nDP is 2025/286 \u22487.0804 \n\nSo AP\u224814.7727 +7.0804\u224821.853 \n\n3125 divided by143 is approximately 21.853, so that's consistent. \n\nBut let me check the key steps again. \n\nFirst, coordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). \n\nThen, distance DB squared: (\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2 \n\n\u0394x =9 -9/2=9/2, so squared is 81/4 \n\n\u0394y =0 - (-27\u221a14/11)=27\u221a14/11, squared is (27^2 *14)/11\u00b2=729*14/121 \n\n729*14: 700*14=9800, 29*14=406 \u21d2 total 10206 \n\nThus, 10206/121 \n\nSo DB squared is 81/4 +10206/121 \n\nConvert to common denominator 484: \n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484 = 9801/484 \n\n10206/121 = (10206*4)/484 =40824/484 \n\nTotal:9801+40824=50625 \u21d2 50625/484 \u21d2 sqrt is 225/22. Correct. \n\nThen DA: distance between A(26/3,4\u221a14/3) and D(9/2, -27\u221a14/11). \n\n\u0394x=9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= -25/6 \n\n\u0394y= -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3)=\u221a14*(-81/33 -44/33)=\u221a14*(-125/33) \n\nThus, squared terms: \n\n(25/6)^2=625/36 \n\n(\u221a14*125/33)^2=14*(125^2)/33\u00b2=14*15625/1089=218750/1089 \n\nThus, AD squared:625/36 +218750/1089 \n\nConvert to 4356 denominator: \n\n625/36 = (625*121)/4356=75625/4356 \n\n218750/1089= (218750*4)/4356=875000/4356 \n\nTotal:75625 +875000=950,625 \u21d2 950625/4356 \n\nWhich is (975)^2/(66)^2? Wait 975\u00b2= 950625, yes. Wait, 975\u00b2 = (1000-25)^2=1000000-50000+625=950625. \n\nWait, but denominator is 4356=66\u00b2. \n\nThus AD squared= (975/66)^2 \u21d2 AD=975/66 \n\nWait, but 975 divided by 66: \n\n66\u00d714=924, 975-924=51 \u21d2 14 +51/66 \u21d2 simplifies to 975/66= 325/22 (divided numerator and denominator by 3). \n\nYes, 975 \u00f73=325, 66 \u00f73=22. So correct. \n\nThen DP = DB\u00b2/DA = (225/22)^2 / (325/22)= (225\u00b2 /22\u00b2) * (22/325)=225\u00b2/(22*325) \n\nWait, 225 squared is 50625, so 50625/(22\u00d7325)=50625/(7150). Wait, but earlier steps: \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nDB squared is (225/22)^2 =50625/484 \n\nDA is 325/22 \n\nThus DP= (50625/484)/(325/22)=50625/484 *22/325= (50625*22)/(484*325) \n\nBut 484=22*22, so 22/484=1/22 \n\nThus, DP=50625/(22*325)=50625/(7150) \n\nWait, 50625 divided by 325: \n\n325\u00d7155=50,375 \n\n50625-50,375=250 \n\n250/325=50/65=10/13 \n\nThus, 50625/325=155 +10/13= (155\u00d713 +10)/13= (2015 +10)/13=2025/13 \n\nWait, so 50625/325 =2025/13 \n\nThus, DP= (2025/13)/22=2025/(13\u00d722)=2025/286. Yes, that matches. \n\nTherefore, DP is 2025/286 \n\nThen AP=AD + DP= 325/22 +2025/286 \n\nConvert 325/22 to denominator 286: multiply numerator and denominator by 13: \n\n325\u00d713=4225 \n\n22\u00d713=286 \n\nThus 325/22=4225/286 \n\nThen adding 2025/286 gives 4225+2025=6250 \n\nThus 6250/286 \n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 2 gives 3125/143 \n\n3125 and 143: 143 is 11\u00d713, 3125 is 5^5. No common factors. So yes, reduced. \n\nTherefore, AP=3125/143, so m=3125, n=143. \n\n3125 +143= 3268 \n\nHmm, but wait the problem says AP can be written as m/n with m and n coprime. 3125 and 143 are coprime. \n\nWait, but 3125 is 5^5, 143 is 11\u00d713. No common factors. So yes, the answer is 3125+143=3268. \n\nWait, but I feel like this might be a big number. Let me check if I made any miscalculations. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. \n\nAlternative method using power of a point and Stewart's theorem or something else. \n\nAlternatively, use harmonic division or projective geometry. \n\nAlternatively, since D is the exsimetral? Maybe use trigonometric approach. \n\nAlternatively, use inversion. \n\nAlternatively, use the fact that AP * AD = DB\u00b2 + AD\u00b2? Wait, no, earlier we had AP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD. \n\nWait, in the power of a point: \n\nWe have DP * DA = DB\u00b2 \n\nBut AP = AD + DP \n\nThus, DP = AP - AD \n\nSo substituting, (AP - AD)*AD = DB\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, AP*AD - AD\u00b2 = DB\u00b2 \n\nThus, AP*AD = AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, AP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD \n\nWhich is AD + (DB\u00b2)/AD \n\nWhich is what I had earlier. \n\nSo using this formula, AP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD \n\nGiven AD =325/22 and DB=225/22 \n\nTherefore, AD squared is (325/22)^2, DB squared is (225/22)^2 \n\nThus, AP = [ (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2)/22\u00b2 ] / (325/22) \n\n= (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) * (22/325) \n\n= (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2)/(22*325) \n\nFactor numerator: \n\n325\u00b2 +225\u00b2 = (325)^2 + (225)^2 \n\nCompute this: \n\n325\u00b2 = 105,625 \n\n225\u00b2 =50,625 \n\nTotal:105,625 +50,625 =156,250 \n\nThus numerator is156,250 \n\nDenominator:22\u00d7325= 7,150 \n\nThus AP=156250/7150 \n\nSimplify this fraction: \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10:15625/715 \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 3125/143 \n\nSame result as before. So that confirms it. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 3125 +143 =3268. \n\nHmm, that's a relief. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{3268}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{3268}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again and make sure I understand everything. \n\nWe have triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at points B and C meet at point D. Then, the line AD intersects the circle \u03c9 again at point P. The sides of the triangle are given: AB is 5, BC is 9, and AC is 10. We need to find the length of AP, which can be written as a fraction m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. \n\nAlright, let me start by drawing a rough sketch in my mind. Triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. The circle \u03c9 is the circumcircle of ABC. The tangents at B and C meet at D. Then line AD meets the circle again at P. So AP is the segment from A to P along AD. \n\nHmm, tangents from a common point D to a circle are equal in length. So DB = DC because they're both tangents from D to the circle \u03c9. That might be useful. Also, point D is the exsymmedian or something? Maybe not, but perhaps I can use properties of pole and polar lines here. \n\nAlternatively, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then AD is the symmedian of triangle ABC? Wait, the symmedian is the reflection of the median over the angle bisector. Hmm, not sure if that's directly applicable here. Let me recall that the polar of point D with respect to the circle \u03c9 would be line BC, since the tangents from D touch at B and C. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using power of a point. The power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DB^2 = DC^2. Also, since AD passes through P, then AP * AD = power of A with respect to \u03c9? Wait, no. Wait, A is on the circle, so the power of A is zero. Hmm, perhaps I need to use power of point D. \n\nPower of D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. Because AD passes through P, so DP * DA = power of D. Wait, but P is on the circle, so DP * DA would be equal to the power of D with respect to \u03c9. \n\nWait, let me recall the power of a point formula: For a point D outside a circle, the power is equal to the square of the tangent from D to the circle. So, Power of D = DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. \n\nTherefore, DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. \n\nSo, if I can find DB and DA, then I can relate them. Alternatively, maybe express DP as DA - AP? Let's see. Let me denote AP as x, then DP would be DA - AP = DA - x. Wait, but actually, since P is another intersection point, so AD is a line from A through D to P? Wait no, hold on. Wait, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P? Wait, that might not be correct. Wait, actually, the problem says \"AD intersects \u03c9 at P\", so since A is already on \u03c9, then P must be the other intersection point. So the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then exits the circle at P. Wait, but then P would be on the extension of AD beyond D? Wait, but D is outside the circle because it's the intersection of two tangents. So yes, the line AD starts at A, goes through D (outside the circle), and then P is the other intersection point? Wait, but then AP would be from A to P, which is through D. Wait, but in that case, the length AP would be AD + DP? But DP would be from D to P, but since D is outside, then AP would be AD plus DP? Hmm, perhaps. Wait, but let me get this straight. \n\nLet me think of the points: A is on the circle, D is outside, so the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then continues to P, which is another point on the circle. Wait, but that would mean that P is on the opposite side of D from A. Wait, but then the length AP would be AD + DP. However, since D is the intersection of the tangents, maybe the order is different. Alternatively, maybe the line AD goes from A through D, and then P is on the other side of D. Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the configuration. \n\nAlternatively, maybe P is between A and D? But since A is on the circle, and D is outside, then if we go from A towards D, which is outside, the other intersection point would be beyond D. So AP would be AD + DP, but since we are going from A through D to P, so AP = AD + DP. Wait, but then DP would be the segment from D to P, so AP is AD + DP. But in terms of power of a point, Power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DP * DA. \n\nWait, if DP is the segment from D to P, then DA is the length from D to A, so DA = AD? Wait, DA is the same as AD. Wait, but in power of a point, it's DP * DA = DB\u00b2. So, DP * DA = DB\u00b2. \n\nSo, if I let AP = x, then since AP is from A to P, and P is beyond D from A, then AP = AD + DP. Let me denote AD as y, so DP = AP - AD = x - y? Wait, but that might complicate. Alternatively, let me set variables properly. \n\nLet me denote AP = t, then since P is on AD beyond D, the length from A to D is AD, and from D to P is DP, so AP = AD + DP. Therefore, DP = AP - AD = t - AD. \n\nBut according to power of point D: DP * DA = DB\u00b2. \n\nWait, DP is the segment from D to P, and DA is from D to A? Wait, no, DA is from D to A. Wait, in the power of a point formula, for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to the two intersections with the line. So, if line DP intersects the circle at A and P, then DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but actually, the power of D is equal to DA * DP, since A and P are the two points where line AD intersects the circle. \n\nYes, exactly. The power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nSo, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, if I can find DA and DB, I can relate them. But perhaps I need to express AP in terms of DA and DP. Since AP = AD + DP (if P is beyond D), but in terms of DA and DP: Let me clarify the notation. Let me let AD be the length from A to D, then DP is the length from D to P. Since P is on the line beyond D from A, then AP = AD + DP. \n\nTherefore, DP = AP - AD. \n\nSo, substituting into the power equation: DA * DP = DA*(AP - DA) = DB\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, DA*(AP - DA) = DB\u00b2. \n\nLet me write that as: DA * AP - DA\u00b2 = DB\u00b2 \n\nSo, DA * AP = DA\u00b2 + DB\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, AP = (DA\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/DA \n\nHmm, but I don't know DA or DB yet. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can find coordinates? Let me think. Maybe coordinate geometry would be a good approach here. Let me try that. \n\nFirst, let me set up coordinate system. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0) to simplify calculations, since AC is 10 and BC is 9. Let me denote coordinates as follows: Let me let point C be (0,0). Let me put point B somewhere on the x-axis? Wait, but then AC is 10. Wait, perhaps place points such that calculations are easier. \n\nAlternatively, let me use coordinates with triangle ABC. Let me denote coordinates for triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me use the coordinate system with point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC=9. Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute coordinates of point A. \n\nGiven that AC = 10 and AB =5, so coordinates of A must satisfy distance from C(0,0) to A(x,y) is 10, and distance from B(9,0) to A(x,y) is 5. \n\nSo, equations: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 10\u00b2 = 100 \n\nand \n\n(x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 = 5\u00b2 =25 \n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x -9)^2 + y\u00b2] = 100 -25 \n\nExpand: x\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 -18x +81) =75 \n\nSimplify: 18x -81 =75 \n\n18x = 75 +81 =156 \n\nx = 156/18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666... \n\nThen, plug x back into first equation: \n\n(26/3)^2 + y\u00b2 = 100 \n\nCalculate (26/3)^2: 676/9 \n\nSo, y\u00b2 = 100 - 676/9 = (900 - 676)/9 = 224/9 \n\nThus, y = \u00b1\u221a(224/9) = \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3 \n\nHmm, okay. Let me take y positive, so point A is at (26/3, 4\u221a14/3). \n\nSo coordinates: \n\nC is (0,0), B is (9,0), A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3). \n\nNow, I need to find the coordinates of point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. \n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can compute the circumcircle. \n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates for three points, we can find the equation of the circle. \n\nLet me denote the general equation of a circle as: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 \n\nPlugging in points A, B, C: \n\nFor point C (0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0 \n\nWait, but that would mean the circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0. \n\nBut point B is (9,0): \n\n9\u00b2 +0 + D*9 + E*0 =0 \u21d2 81 +9D =0 \u21d2 9D = -81 \u21d2 D= -9 \n\nThen, point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3): \n\n(26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 + D*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0 \n\nPlugging D = -9: \n\n(676/9) + (16*14)/9 + (-9)*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0 \n\nCompute each term: \n\nFirst term: 676/9 \n\nSecond term: (224)/9 \n\nThird term: -9*(26/3) = - (234)/3 = -78 \n\nFourth term: (4\u221a14/3) E \n\nSo adding first two terms: (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100 \n\nSo total equation: 100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 \n\nThus, 22 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14/3) E = -22 \u21d2 E = (-22)*(3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14) \n\nRationalizing the denominator: E = (-33\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-33\u221a14)/28 \n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle is: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + E y =0, with E as above. \n\nThus, the equation is: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0 \n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe I made an error in calculation. Let me check again. \n\nWait, let me recalculate the term for point A. \n\nFirst term: (26/3)^2 = (26)^2 /9 = 676/9 \n\nSecond term: (4\u221a14/3)^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9 \n\nThird term: D*(26/3) = (-9)*(26/3) = -234/3 = -78 \n\nFourth term: E*(4\u221a14/3) \n\nSo total equation: \n\n676/9 +224/9 -78 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 \n\nAdding first two terms: (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 = 100 \n\nSo 100 -78 =22, so 22 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 \n\nTherefore, solving for E: \n\n(4\u221a14/3) E = -22 \n\nMultiply both sides by 3: 4\u221a14 E = -66 \n\nDivide by 4\u221a14: E = -66/(4\u221a14) = -33/(2\u221a14) \n\nYes, that's correct. So rationalizing gives E = -33\u221a14/(2*14) = -33\u221a14/28. \n\nHmm, okay. So the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0. \n\nHmm, perhaps this is manageable, but maybe there is a better way. Alternatively, maybe using parametric equations for the tangents. \n\nAlternatively, since we need the tangents at B and C. Let me recall that the tangent at a point on a circle is perpendicular to the radius at that point. \n\nSo, the tangent at point B (9,0) to the circle \u03c9. The center of the circle is at (D/2, E/2) from the general equation. Wait, in the general equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, the center is (-D/2, -E/2). \n\nSo here, D is -9, E is - (33\u221a14)/28. \n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0, so D is -9, E is - (33\u221a14)/28. Therefore, the center is at (-D/2, -E/2) = (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56). \n\nHmm, that's a bit complicated, but okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the tangent lines at B and C. \n\nThe tangent at point B (9,0): \n\nThe slope of the radius from center to B is (y_B - y_center)/(x_B - x_center). \n\nCenter is (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56). \n\nSo the slope from center to B (9,0) is (0 - (33\u221a14)/56)/(9 - 9/2) = (-33\u221a14/56)/(9/2) = (-33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (-33\u221a14)/252 = (-11\u221a14)/84 \n\nTherefore, the tangent line at B is perpendicular to this radius. So its slope is the negative reciprocal. \n\nSlope of tangent at B: m_B = 84/(11\u221a14) \n\nHmm, that's a bit messy. Let me rationalize that. \n\nWait, 84 divided by (11\u221a14) is equal to (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11 \n\nWait, because 84 divided by 14 is 6. \n\nYes, so m_B = (84)/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11 \n\nTherefore, the tangent line at B has slope (6\u221a14)/11. \n\nSimilarly, the tangent at point C (0,0). Let me compute that. \n\nThe slope of the radius from center to C (0,0): \n\nCenter is (9/2, (33\u221a14)/56). \n\nSlope is ( (33\u221a14)/56 - 0 ) / (9/2 - 0) = (33\u221a14)/56 / (9/2) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (33\u221a14)/252 = (11\u221a14)/84 \n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to this radius, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: m_C = -84/(11\u221a14) \n\nSimilarly, rationalizing: \n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = - (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = - (6\u221a14)/11 \n\nTherefore, the tangent at C has slope -6\u221a14/11. \n\nNow, equations of the tangent lines: \n\nFor tangent at B (9,0) with slope (6\u221a14)/11: \n\nEquation: y -0 = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9) \n\nSimilarly, tangent at C (0,0) with slope -6\u221a14/11: \n\nEquation: y -0 = (-6\u221a14/11)(x -0) \u21d2 y = (-6\u221a14/11)x \n\nNow, the point D is the intersection of these two tangent lines. \n\nSo, set the two equations equal: \n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x \n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to simplify: \n\n(x -9) = -x \n\nTherefore, x -9 = -x \u21d2 2x =9 \u21d2 x=9/2 \n\nThen plug back into the equation for the tangent at C: \n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)(9/2) = (-6\u221a14 *9)/(22) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11 \n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) \n\nHmm, okay. Now, we need to find point P, which is the other intersection of line AD with the circle. \n\nFirst, let me find the parametric equation of line AD. \n\nPoints A and D: \n\nPoint A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3) \n\nPoint D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) \n\nLet me compute the vector from A to D: \n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6) \n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) \n\nCompute the terms inside: \n\n-27/11 -4/3 = (-81 -44)/33 = (-125)/33 \n\nTherefore, \u0394y = \u221a14*(-125/33) \n\nThus, the parametric equations for line AD can be written as: \n\nx = 26/3 + t*(-25/6) \n\ny = (4\u221a14)/3 + t*(-125\u221a14)/33 \n\nWe can write this as: \n\nx = 26/3 - (25/6)t \n\ny = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14)/33 t \n\nWe need to find the point P \u2260 A where this line intersects the circle again. \n\nWe can substitute these parametric equations into the circle equation and solve for t. Since point A is already on the circle (t=0), the other solution will correspond to point P. \n\nThe circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0 \n\nLet me substitute x and y from the parametric equations into this equation. \n\nFirst, compute x\u00b2: \n\n[26/3 - (25/6)t]^2 \n\nSimilarly, y\u00b2: [ (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14)/33 t ]^2 \n\nThen, compute -9x and - (33\u221a14)/28 y \n\nThis seems very algebra-heavy, but let's proceed step by step. \n\nFirst, let me denote t as a parameter. Let me compute each term. \n\nLet me first compute x = 26/3 - (25/6)t \n\nLet me write all terms with denominator 6 for x: \n\nx = (52/6 -25t/6) = (52 -25t)/6 \n\nSimilarly, y = [4\u221a14/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t] \n\nLet me factor out \u221a14: \n\ny = \u221a14 [4/3 - (125/33)t] \n\nLet me write 4/3 as 44/33 to have common denominator: \n\n4/3 = 44/33 \n\nSo y = \u221a14 [44/33 - (125/33)t ] = \u221a14 [ (44 -125t)/33 ] \n\nTherefore, y = \u221a14*(44 -125t)/33 \n\nNow, let's compute each term in the circle equation. \n\nFirst term: x\u00b2 = [ (52 -25t)/6 ]\u00b2 = (52 -25t)^2 / 36 \n\nSecond term: y\u00b2 = [ \u221a14*(44 -125t)/33 ]^2 = 14*(44 -125t)^2 / (33)^2 \n\nThird term: -9x = -9*(52 -25t)/6 = - (9/6)*(52 -25t) = - (3/2)*(52 -25t) \n\nFourth term: - (33\u221a14)/28 * y = - (33\u221a14)/28 * [ \u221a14*(44 -125t)/33 ] \n\nSimplify this term: \n\nThe 33 cancels, \u221a14 * \u221a14 =14, so: \n\n- (14*(44 -125t))/28 = - (44 -125t)/2 \n\nTherefore, putting all terms into the equation: \n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0 \n\nbecomes \n\n[ (52 -25t)^2 / 36 ] + [14*(44 -125t)^2 / (33)^2 ] - [ (3/2)*(52 -25t) ] - [ (44 -125t)/2 ] =0 \n\nThis is going to be complicated, but let me try to compute term by term. \n\nFirst term: Let me compute (52 -25t)^2: \n\n=52\u00b2 - 2*52*25 t + (25t)^2 = 2704 - 2600t + 625t\u00b2 \n\nSo first term is (2704 -2600t +625t\u00b2)/36 \n\nSecond term: \n\n14*(44 -125t)^2 / 33\u00b2 \n\nFirst compute (44 -125t)^2: \n\n=44\u00b2 - 2*44*125 t + (125t)^2 = 1936 - 11000t + 15625t\u00b2 \n\nMultiply by 14: \n\n14*1936 = 27104 \n\n14*(-11000t) = -154000t \n\n14*(15625t\u00b2) = 218750t\u00b2 \n\nThus, numerator is 27104 -154000t +218750t\u00b2 \n\nDenominator is 33\u00b2=1089 \n\nSo second term: (27104 -154000t +218750t\u00b2)/1089 \n\nThird term: \n\n- (3/2)*(52 -25t) = - (3/2)*52 + (3/2)*25t = -78 + (75/2)t \n\nFourth term: \n\n- (44 -125t)/2 = -22 + (125/2)t \n\nPutting all terms together: \n\nFirst term + Second term + Third term + Fourth term =0 \n\nSo: \n\n[ (2704 -2600t +625t\u00b2)/36 ] + [ (27104 -154000t +218750t\u00b2)/1089 ] + [ -78 + (75/2)t ] + [ -22 + (125/2)t ] =0 \n\nLet me combine the constants, the terms with t, and the t\u00b2 terms. \n\nFirst, let me handle the constants: \n\n-78 -22 = -100 \n\nTerms with t: \n\n(75/2)t + (125/2)t = (200/2)t =100t \n\nTerms with t\u00b2: \n\n625t\u00b2/36 +218750t\u00b2/1089 \n\nTerms from first part: \n\n(2704 -2600t)/36 \n\nWait, actually, wait, the first term has a numerator with constants, t terms, and t\u00b2 terms. Similarly, the second term also. \n\nWait, actually, I think I need to separate each term into their components. \n\nLet me re-express each big term: \n\nFirst big term: \n\n(2704 -2600t +625t\u00b2)/36 \n\n= 2704/36 -2600t/36 +625t\u00b2/36 \n\nSecond big term: \n\n(27104 -154000t +218750t\u00b2)/1089 \n\n=27104/1089 -154000t/1089 +218750t\u00b2/1089 \n\nThird and fourth terms combined: \n\n(-100) +100t \n\nSo, combining all terms: \n\nConstants: 2704/36 +27104/1089 -100 \n\nLinear terms: (-2600/36 -154000/1089 +100 ) t \n\nQuadratic terms: (625/36 +218750/1089) t\u00b2 \n\nSet the entire expression equal to zero. \n\nThis is very tedious. Perhaps I can find a common denominator or see if there's a better approach. Alternatively, maybe there is a property I can use instead of coordinates. \n\nWait, since AP * AD = power of A? Wait, no. Wait, the power of point D is DB\u00b2 = DP * DA. \n\nWait, let me recall that. \n\nPower of D: DB\u00b2 = DP * DA \n\nWe need to find AP. Let me see if I can express AP in terms of DA and DP. \n\nSince P is on line AD beyond D, then AP = AD + DP \n\nBut from power of point: DP * DA = DB\u00b2 \n\nLet me denote AD as x, then DP = DB\u00b2 / x \n\nTherefore, AP = x + (DB\u00b2)/x \n\nWe need to find AP, so if I can compute AD and DB, then I can compute AP. \n\nAlternatively, compute AD and DB using coordinates. \n\nWait, maybe that's a better approach. \n\nWe already have coordinates for points A, D, so let me compute AD first. \n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3) \n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) \n\nCompute distance AD: \n\n\u0394x = 9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6) = (-25/6) \n\n\u0394y = (-27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3) \n\nConvert to common denominator 33: \n\n-27/11 = -81/33 \n\n-4/3 = -44/33 \n\nTotal: -81 -44 = -125/33 \n\nThus, \u0394y = \u221a14*(-125/33) \n\nTherefore, distance AD is sqrt[(\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2] \n\nCompute (\u0394x)^2: (25/6)^2 = 625/36 \n\n(\u0394y)^2: ( (\u221a14 *125/33)^2 ) Wait, but with the negative sign squared. \n\nSo (\u0394y)^2 = ( (\u221a14 * 125/33 )^2 ) =14*(125/33)^2 \n\nThus, AD squared is 625/36 +14*(125/33)^2 \n\nLet me compute this step by step. \n\nFirst term: 625/36 \n\nSecond term: 14*(125\u00b2)/(33\u00b2) \n\n125 squared is 15625 \n\nSo 14*15625 = 218750 \n\nThus, second term is 218750/(33\u00b2) \n\nSo AD\u00b2 = 625/36 +218750/1089 \n\nTo add these, need a common denominator. Let me compute LCM of 36 and 1089. \n\nFactor 36: 2\u00b2*3\u00b2 \n\nFactor 1089: 33\u00b2 = (3*11)^2 = 3\u00b2*11\u00b2 \n\nThus LCM is 2\u00b2*3\u00b2*11\u00b2 =4*9*121=4*1089=4356 \n\nConvert each term: \n\n625/36 = (625 * 121)/4356 \n\nBecause 36 *121 =4356 \n\nSimilarly, 218750/1089 = (218750 *4)/4356 \n\nBecause 1089 *4=4356 \n\nCompute numerator: \n\nFirst term: 625 *121 \n\n625 *121: 625*120=75000, plus 625*1=625 \u21d2 total 75625 \n\nSecond term: 218750 *4 = 875000 \n\nThus total numerator:75625 +875000= 950,625 \n\nTherefore, AD\u00b2 = 950625 /4356 \n\nSimplify this fraction: \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 9: \n\n950625 \u00f79= 105625 \n\n4356 \u00f79= 484 \n\nSo 105625/484 \n\nCheck if further simplification is possible. \n\n484 is 22\u00b2=4*121=4*11\u00b2 \n\n105625 divided by 11: 105625 \u00f711= 9602.27\u2026 Not integer. \n\nWait, 105625 divided by 25 is 4225, which is 65\u00b2. Hmm. \n\nWait 105625 = 25 * 4225 =25*65\u00b2 \n\n484 =4*121=4*11\u00b2 \n\nSo, 105625/484 = (25*65\u00b2)/(4*11\u00b2) \n\nBut not sure if that helps. \n\nAnyway, AD squared is 105625/484, so AD is sqrt(105625/484)= (325)/22 \n\nWait, sqrt(105625) is 325, sqrt(484)=22. \n\nYes! Because 325\u00b2 = (300+25)^2 =90000 +15000 +625= 105625 \n\n22\u00b2=484. \n\nTherefore, AD = 325/22 \n\nOkay, that's a relief. So AD is 325/22. \n\nNow, need to compute DB. \n\nPoint D is at (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) and point B is at (9,0). \n\nCompute the distance between D and B. \n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11) \n\nCoordinates of B: (9, 0) \n\n\u0394x =9 -9/2 =9/2 \n\n\u0394y =0 - (-27\u221a14/11)=27\u221a14/11 \n\nThus, distance DB squared is (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14/11)^2 \n\nCompute each term: \n\n(9/2)^2 =81/4 \n\n(27\u221a14/11)^2 = (27\u00b2)*(14)/(11\u00b2)=729*14/121 \n\n729*14: 700*14=9800, 29*14=406, total 9800+406=10206 \n\nThus, 10206/121 \n\nSo total DB squared is 81/4 +10206/121 \n\nAgain, common denominator needed. \n\nLCM of 4 and 121 is 484 \n\nConvert each term: \n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484 \n\n10206/121= (10206*4)/484 \n\nCompute numerators: \n\n81*121: 81*120=9720 +81*1=81 \u21d2 total 9801 \n\n10206*4=40824 \n\nTotal numerator:9801 +40824 = 50625 \n\nThus DB squared is 50625/484 \n\nTherefore, DB = sqrt(50625/484)=225/22 \n\nBecause sqrt(50625)=225, sqrt(484)=22 \n\nSo DB =225/22 \n\nTherefore, going back to the power of point D: \n\nDB\u00b2 = (225/22)^2 =50625/484 \n\nAnd DA * DP = DB\u00b2 \n\nWe have DA =325/22 \n\nThus, DP = (DB\u00b2)/DA = (50625/484)/(325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325) \n\nSimplify: \n\n50625 divided by 325: let's see. 325*156= 325*(150+6)=48750 +1950=50700. Hmm, 50625 is 50700 -75. So 50625 =325*156 -75. Not sure. Alternatively, factor numerator and denominator. \n\n50625 = 225\u00b2 \n\n325=25*13 \n\n22 and 484: 484=4*121=4*11\u00b2, 22=2*11 \n\nLet me write the fraction as: \n\n(225\u00b2 *22)/(484 *325) \n\n= (225\u00b2 *22)/( (4*121)*(25*13)) \n\nBreakdown denominators and numerators: \n\n225\u00b2 = (15\u00b2)^2=15^4 \n\n22=2*11 \n\n4=2\u00b2 \n\n121=11\u00b2 \n\n25=5\u00b2 \n\n13=13 \n\nSo, numerator: 15^4 *2*11 \n\nDenominator: 2\u00b2 *11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13 \n\nSimplify terms: \n\nCancel 2: numerator has 2, denominator has 2\u00b2 \u21d2 remains 2 in denominator \n\nCancel 11: numerator has 11, denominator has 11\u00b2 \u21d2 remains 11 in denominator \n\nSo now: \n\n(15^4 ) / (2*11*5\u00b2*13) \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nWait, 15^4 is (3*5)^4=3^4*5^4 \n\nSo numerator: 3^4 *5^4 *2*11 \n\nDenominator: 2*11*5\u00b2 *13 *2 (Wait, wait, let me re-express step by step). \n\nWait, numerator: 15^4 *2*11 = (3^4 *5^4)*2*11 \n\nDenominator: 2\u00b2 *11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13 \n\nSo breaking down: \n\nNumerator: 3^4 *5^4 *2 *11 \n\nDenominator: 2\u00b2 *11\u00b2 *5\u00b2 *13 \n\nCancel common factors: \n\n5^4 /5\u00b2 =5\u00b2 \n\n2/2\u00b2=1/2 \n\n11/11\u00b2=1/11 \n\nThus remaining: \n\n3^4 *5\u00b2 / (2 *11 *13) \n\nCompute numerator: \n\n3^4=81, 5\u00b2=25 \u21d2 81*25=2025 \n\nDenominator: 2*11*13= 286 \n\nThus, DP=2025/286 \n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again. \n\nWait, numerator after cancellation: \n\n3^4 *5\u00b2 =81 *25=2025 \n\nDenominator: 2*11*13 =2*143=286 \n\nYes. \n\nTherefore, DP=2025/286 \n\nWait, but let me check the previous steps again for errors. \n\nWait, so DP = (50625/484)/(325/22) \n\n=50625/484 *22/325 \n\nYes. \n\n50625 divided by 325: 50625 \u00f7325. Let me compute that. \n\n325 \u00d7 155 = 325*(150 +5)= 48750 +1625=50375 \n\n50625 -50375=250 \n\nSo 50625=325\u00d7155 +250 \n\nHmm, not exact. Alternatively, perhaps simplifying the fraction step by step. \n\n50625/484 divided by 325/22 is equal to (50625/484)*(22/325) \n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator: \n\n50625=225\u00b2= (15\u00b2)^2=3^4\u00d75^4 \n\n22=2\u00d711 \n\n484=2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2 \n\n325=5\u00b2\u00d713 \n\nThus, \n\nNumerator: 3^4\u00d75^4 \u00d72\u00d711 \n\nDenominator: 2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2\u00d75\u00b2\u00d713 \n\nCancel terms: \n\n2 in numerator cancels with one 2 in denominator, leaving 2 in denominator \n\n11 in numerator cancels with one 11 in denominator, leaving 11 in denominator \n\n5^4 /5\u00b2=5\u00b2 \n\nSo remaining numerator:3^4\u00d75\u00b2 \n\nDenominator:2\u00d711\u00d713 \n\nYes, so 3^4\u00d75\u00b2=81\u00d725=2025 \n\nDenominator:2\u00d711\u00d713=286 \n\nThus DP=2025/286 \n\nSimplify this fraction? Let's see if 2025 and 286 have common factors. \n\n286 factors: 2\u00d711\u00d713 \n\n2025 divided by 2? No. 2025 is odd. Divided by 11? 11\u00d7184=2024, so 2025-2024=1 \u21d2 no. Divided by 13? 13\u00d7155=2015, 2025-2015=10 \u21d2 no. So 2025 and 286 are coprime? Wait 2025 is 45\u00b2, which is (9\u00d75)^2, so factors 3^4\u00d75\u00b2. 286 is 2\u00d711\u00d713. So no common factors. So DP=2025/286 \n\nTherefore, going back, AP = AD + DP \n\nAD was 325/22, DP is 2025/286 \n\nConvert to common denominator. Let me compute 325/22 +2025/286 \n\n286 is 13\u00d722. \n\nThus, 325/22 = (325\u00d713)/286 \n\n325\u00d713: 300\u00d713=3900, 25\u00d713=325 \u21d2 total 4225 \n\nThus, 325/22 =4225/286 \n\nThen, adding 2025/286: \n\nTotal AP = (4225 +2025)/286 =6250/286 \n\nSimplify this fraction. \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: \n\n6250 \u00f72=3125 \n\n286 \u00f72=143 \n\nSo AP=3125/143 \n\nCheck if this can be reduced. \n\n143 factors:11\u00d713 \n\n3125 is 5^5. 143 is 11\u00d713, neither of which divide 5. So yes, reduced. \n\nTherefore, AP=3125/143, so m=3125 and n=143. \n\nCheck if they are coprime. Since 143=11\u00d713, and 3125 is 5^5. No common factors. So m +n=3125+143=3268. \n\nWait, but let me verify my calculations again because this seems a bit large, and I might have made an arithmetic mistake. \n\nWait, let me check AP = AD + DP. \n\nAD is 325/22 \u224814.7727 \n\nDP is 2025/286 \u22487.0804 \n\nSo AP\u224814.7727 +7.0804\u224821.853 \n\n3125 divided by143 is approximately 21.853, so that's consistent. \n\nBut let me check the key steps again. \n\nFirst, coordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). \n\nThen, distance DB squared: (\u0394x)^2 + (\u0394y)^2 \n\n\u0394x =9 -9/2=9/2, so squared is 81/4 \n\n\u0394y =0 - (-27\u221a14/11)=27\u221a14/11, squared is (27^2 *14)/11\u00b2=729*14/121 \n\n729*14: 700*14=9800, 29*14=406 \u21d2 total 10206 \n\nThus, 10206/121 \n\nSo DB squared is 81/4 +10206/121 \n\nConvert to common denominator 484: \n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484 = 9801/484 \n\n10206/121 = (10206*4)/484 =40824/484 \n\nTotal:9801+40824=50625 \u21d2 50625/484 \u21d2 sqrt is 225/22. Correct. \n\nThen DA: distance between A(26/3,4\u221a14/3) and D(9/2, -27\u221a14/11). \n\n\u0394x=9/2 -26/3 = (27/6 -52/6)= -25/6 \n\n\u0394y= -27\u221a14/11 -4\u221a14/3 = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3)=\u221a14*(-81/33 -44/33)=\u221a14*(-125/33) \n\nThus, squared terms: \n\n(25/6)^2=625/36 \n\n(\u221a14*125/33)^2=14*(125^2)/33\u00b2=14*15625/1089=218750/1089 \n\nThus, AD squared:625/36 +218750/1089 \n\nConvert to 4356 denominator: \n\n625/36 = (625*121)/4356=75625/4356 \n\n218750/1089= (218750*4)/4356=875000/4356 \n\nTotal:75625 +875000=950,625 \u21d2 950625/4356 \n\nWhich is (975)^2/(66)^2? Wait 975\u00b2= 950625, yes. Wait, 975\u00b2 = (1000-25)^2=1000000-50000+625=950625. \n\nWait, but denominator is 4356=66\u00b2. \n\nThus AD squared= (975/66)^2 \u21d2 AD=975/66 \n\nWait, but 975 divided by 66: \n\n66\u00d714=924, 975-924=51 \u21d2 14 +51/66 \u21d2 simplifies to 975/66= 325/22 (divided numerator and denominator by 3). \n\nYes, 975 \u00f73=325, 66 \u00f73=22. So correct. \n\nThen DP = DB\u00b2/DA = (225/22)^2 / (325/22)= (225\u00b2 /22\u00b2) * (22/325)=225\u00b2/(22*325) \n\nWait, 225 squared is 50625, so 50625/(22\u00d7325)=50625/(7150). Wait, but earlier steps: \n\nWait, let me see: \n\nDB squared is (225/22)^2 =50625/484 \n\nDA is 325/22 \n\nThus DP= (50625/484)/(325/22)=50625/484 *22/325= (50625*22)/(484*325) \n\nBut 484=22*22, so 22/484=1/22 \n\nThus, DP=50625/(22*325)=50625/(7150) \n\nWait, 50625 divided by 325: \n\n325\u00d7155=50,375 \n\n50625-50,375=250 \n\n250/325=50/65=10/13 \n\nThus, 50625/325=155 +10/13= (155\u00d713 +10)/13= (2015 +10)/13=2025/13 \n\nWait, so 50625/325 =2025/13 \n\nThus, DP= (2025/13)/22=2025/(13\u00d722)=2025/286. Yes, that matches. \n\nTherefore, DP is 2025/286 \n\nThen AP=AD + DP= 325/22 +2025/286 \n\nConvert 325/22 to denominator 286: multiply numerator and denominator by 13: \n\n325\u00d713=4225 \n\n22\u00d713=286 \n\nThus 325/22=4225/286 \n\nThen adding 2025/286 gives 4225+2025=6250 \n\nThus 6250/286 \n\nSimplify: divide numerator and denominator by 2 gives 3125/143 \n\n3125 and 143: 143 is 11\u00d713, 3125 is 5^5. No common factors. So yes, reduced. \n\nTherefore, AP=3125/143, so m=3125, n=143. \n\n3125 +143= 3268 \n\nHmm, but wait the problem says AP can be written as m/n with m and n coprime. 3125 and 143 are coprime. \n\nWait, but 3125 is 5^5, 143 is 11\u00d713. No common factors. So yes, the answer is 3125+143=3268. \n\nWait, but I feel like this might be a big number. Let me check if I made any miscalculations. \n\nWait, let me think of another approach. \n\nAlternative method using power of a point and Stewart's theorem or something else. \n\nAlternatively, use harmonic division or projective geometry. \n\nAlternatively, since D is the exsimetral? Maybe use trigonometric approach. \n\nAlternatively, use inversion. \n\nAlternatively, use the fact that AP * AD = DB\u00b2 + AD\u00b2? Wait, no, earlier we had AP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD. \n\nWait, in the power of a point: \n\nWe have DP * DA = DB\u00b2 \n\nBut AP = AD + DP \n\nThus, DP = AP - AD \n\nSo substituting, (AP - AD)*AD = DB\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, AP*AD - AD\u00b2 = DB\u00b2 \n\nThus, AP*AD = AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2 \n\nTherefore, AP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD \n\nWhich is AD + (DB\u00b2)/AD \n\nWhich is what I had earlier. \n\nSo using this formula, AP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD \n\nGiven AD =325/22 and DB=225/22 \n\nTherefore, AD squared is (325/22)^2, DB squared is (225/22)^2 \n\nThus, AP = [ (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2)/22\u00b2 ] / (325/22) \n\n= (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) * (22/325) \n\n= (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2)/(22*325) \n\nFactor numerator: \n\n325\u00b2 +225\u00b2 = (325)^2 + (225)^2 \n\nCompute this: \n\n325\u00b2 = 105,625 \n\n225\u00b2 =50,625 \n\nTotal:105,625 +50,625 =156,250 \n\nThus numerator is156,250 \n\nDenominator:22\u00d7325= 7,150 \n\nThus AP=156250/7150 \n\nSimplify this fraction: \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10:15625/715 \n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 3125/143 \n\nSame result as before. So that confirms it. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 3125 +143 =3268. \n\nHmm, that's a relief. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{3268}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{3268}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\(ABC\\) inscribed in circle \\(\\omega\\) with \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts. It says:\n\nLet ABC be a triangle inscribed in circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D. Then the line AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. We're given the sides AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, let me try to visualize this. There's triangle ABC inscribed in a circle, so it's a cyclic triangle. The tangents at B and C meet at point D. Then connecting A to D, this line meets the circle again at P. We need the length AP. The sides are given, so maybe using some triangle properties, circle theorems, or perhaps power of a point?\n\nLet me recall some theorems. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then DB = DC because the lengths of tangents from a common point to a circle are equal. So D is equidistant from B and C, and lies along the angle bisector of angle BAC? Wait, no, actually, the intersection point of two tangents to a circle lies along the symmedian of the triangle. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, power of a point D with respect to circle \u03c9. The power of D should be equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DB * DC (but they are equal, so DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2). Since D lies outside the circle, the power is also equal to DA * DP, because AD is a secant line passing through P. Wait, yes, Power of a Point says that for a point outside the circle, the product of the lengths from the point to the intersection points with the circle is equal for any secant line. So here, Power of D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. That seems important.\n\nSo if I can find DA and DP, but actually, since we need AP, which is DA - DP if D is outside and P is on the other side of A. Wait, but depending on the configuration. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, Power of a Point formula is: If a line through D intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then DX * DY is equal to the power of D. Here, line AD intersects the circle at A and P, so DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Since D is outside, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. So DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Therefore, if I can find DB and DA, then I can solve for DP, then AP would be DP - DA? Wait, no. Wait, let's think carefully.\n\nSuppose point D is outside the circle. Then the line AD starts at D, goes through A, and then meets the circle again at P. So the order is D---A---P on the line. Therefore, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but DP is the distance from D to P, which would be DA + AP. Wait, actually, the Power of a Point formula states that DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Here, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. Since A is between D and P, then DP = DA + AP. Therefore, substituting:\n\nDA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nBut we need to find AP, so let's denote AP as x. Then DP = DA + x, so:\n\nDA*(DA + x) = DB\u00b2 => DA\u00b2 + DA*x = DB\u00b2.\n\nBut we have two variables here: DA and x (AP). So we need another equation. Hmm. Maybe we can find DA in terms of the sides of the triangle?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use coordinates or trigonometry. Alternatively, maybe using inversion or other methods, but that might be more complex. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using triangle areas or the Law of Cosines. Since the sides of the triangle are given, perhaps we can compute some angles or other lengths.\n\nAlternatively, since ABC is inscribed in a circle, maybe using the Law of Sines. Let me try to compute the circumradius first. Maybe that could help?\n\nWait, the circumradius R of triangle ABC can be found using the formula:\n\nR = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394),\n\nwhere a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let me note the sides: AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. Let me denote the sides as follows: Let\u2019s let BC = a = 9, AC = b = 10, AB = c = 5. Wait, standard notation is usually a opposite angle A, but maybe I should confirm. Wait, in standard notation, a is BC, opposite angle A; b is AC opposite angle B; c is AB opposite angle C. Wait, perhaps I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just compute the area using Heron's formula first.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter, s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.\n\nArea \u0394 = \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = \u221a[12*(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)] = \u221a[12*7*3*2] = \u221a[12*7*6] = \u221a[504] = \u221a[16*31.5]? Wait, no, 12*7*3*2: 12*7 is 84, 84*3 is 252, 252*2 is 504. So sqrt(504). Let me factor that: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, so maybe better to factor into primes:\n\n504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, let's see:\n\nsqrt(504) = sqrt( 16 * 31.5 ) but that's messy. Let me do prime factors again:\n\n504 divided by 2 is 252\n\n252 divided by 2 is 126\n\n126 divided by 2 is 63\n\n63 divided by 3 is 21\n\n21 divided by 3 is 7\n\nSo factors are 2^3, 3^2, 7^1.\n\nThus sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, sqrt(2^3) is 2*sqrt(2), sqrt(3^2) is 3, sqrt(7) is sqrt(7). So yes, 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Therefore area \u0394 = 6\u221a14.\n\nSo then the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4\u0394) = (9*10*5)/(4*6\u221a14) = 450/(24\u221a14) = 75/(4\u221a14). Let me rationalize denominator: 75\u221a14/(4*14) = 75\u221a14/56. Hmm, so R = 75\u221a14 / 56. Not sure if that helps yet, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinate system.\n\nLet me consider placing triangle ABC in coordinate plane. Let me set point C at the origin (0,0) to simplify. Let me let point B be at (9, 0), but wait, but BC is 9? Wait, AC is 10, BC is 9, AB is 5. Hmm, maybe better to set coordinates so that calculations are easier.\n\nAlternatively, let me set point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC is 9. Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s set coordinate system with point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0). Then point A has coordinates (x,y) such that AC = 10 and AB =5.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nPoint C: (0,0)\n\nPoint B: (9,0)\n\nPoint A: (x,y). Then AC = 10: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100.\n\nAB = 5: distance from A to B (9,0): sqrt( (x -9)^2 + y^2 ) =5, so (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nWe can solve these equations to find coordinates of A.\n\nSubtract the two equations:\n\n(x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 -100 => (x\u00b2 -18x +81 + y\u00b2) - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -75 => -18x +81 = -75 => -18x = -156 => x = 156/18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nSo x = 26/3. Then plug back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100:\n\n(26/3)^2 + y\u00b2 =100.\n\n26 squared is 676, so (676/9) + y\u00b2 = 100 => y\u00b2 =100 - 676/9 = (900 -676)/9 = 224/9. So y = \u00b1\u221a(224/9) = \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(2\u221a56)/3 = \u00b1(2*2\u221a14)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3.\n\nHmm, so point A is at (26/3, 4\u221a14/3) or (26/3, -4\u221a14/3). Since the triangle is inscribed in a circle, the position depends on orientation. Let's assume it's above the x-axis, so take positive y-coordinate. So coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nOkay, so coordinates:\n\nA: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nNow, need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, let's find equations for the tangents at B and C.\n\nTo find the tangent lines at points B and C on the circumcircle \u03c9. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can find the equation of the circumcircle, then find the tangent lines.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps compute the circumcircle equation first.\n\nLet me compute the circumcircle equation. Let me recall that the general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nWe can plug in the coordinates of A, B, C to find D, E, F.\n\nPoint C is (0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 => F =0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nPoint B (9,0):\n\n81 +0 +9D +0 +0 =0 => 81 +9D =0 => D = -81/9 = -9.\n\nSo D = -9.\n\nPoint A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\n( (26/3)^2 + ( (4\u221a14)/3 )^2 ) + (-9)(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (26/3)^2 = (676)/9\n\nSecond term: ( (4\u221a14)/3 )^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9\n\nSo total first part: (676 + 224)/9 = 900/9 = 100.\n\nSecond part: -9*(26/3) = -78\n\nThird part: E*(4\u221a14/3)\n\nSo altogether:\n\n100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 => 22 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 => (4\u221a14/3) E = -22 => E = (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14). Rationalize denominator:\n\nE = (-33)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-33\u221a14)/(28).\n\nThus, the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using parametric equations for the tangents at B and C.\n\nAlternatively, the tangent at a point (x\u2080,y\u2080) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D*(x + x\u2080)/2 + E*(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0.\n\nWait, maybe better to recall the formula for tangent line at point (x\u2081,y\u2081) on the circle.\n\nAlternatively, for the circle with center (h,k) and radius r, the tangent at (x\u2081,y\u2081) is (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2? Wait, no, actually, the tangent line equation is:\n\n(x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2?\n\nNo, that's the equation of the circle. Wait, the tangent line at (x\u2081,y\u2081) on the circle (x - h)^2 + (y -k)^2 = r\u00b2 is:\n\n(x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, actually, no. The standard tangent line formula is:\n\nFor circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r\u00b2, the tangent at (x\u2081, y\u2081) is (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, but actually, if (x\u2081, y\u2081) is on the circle, then (x\u2081 - h)^2 + (y\u2081 - k)^2 = r\u00b2, so expanding the tangent equation:\n\n(x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = (x\u2081 - h)^2 + (y\u2081 - k)^2 = r\u00b2, so that's correct. So that is the tangent line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to compute the center of the circle first.\n\nGiven the equation we found earlier: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nLet me rewrite this in standard form by completing the squares.\n\nx\u00b2 -9x + y\u00b2 - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nComplete the square for x terms:\n\nx\u00b2 -9x = x\u00b2 -9x + (81/4) - 81/4 = (x - 9/2)^2 - 81/4.\n\nSimilarly, for y terms:\n\ny\u00b2 - (33\u221a14)/28 y. Let me factor out the coefficient of y\u00b2, which is 1. The coefficient of y is - (33\u221a14)/28. Half of that is - (33\u221a14)/56, square is (33\u221a14 /56)^2. So:\n\ny\u00b2 - (33\u221a14)/28 y = [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 - ( (33\u221a14)/56 )^2.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\n(x - 9/2)^2 -81/4 + [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 - ( (33\u221a14)/56 )^2 =0.\n\nThus,\n\n(x - 9/2)^2 + [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 = 81/4 + ( (33\u221a14)/56 )^2.\n\nHmm, this is getting quite messy. Maybe this approach is not the most efficient. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, perhaps the polar of D with respect to the circle is the line BC? Wait, no. The polar of D would be the line joining the points of contact of the tangents from D, which are B and C. Therefore, the polar of D is line BC. Therefore, point D lies on the polar of BC? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the polar of point D is line BC, so if we want coordinates of D, perhaps we can use pole and polar concepts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center of the circle. Similarly for tangent at C.\n\nIf I can compute the center O, then I can find the equations of the tangents.\n\nAlternatively, given that the coordinates are getting complicated, maybe using barycentric coordinates or other methods?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle ABC, the intersection of the tangents at B and C is the exsymmedian point or something?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of using coordinates again but perhaps compute the tangent lines step by step.\n\nGiven that point B is (9,0), and the tangent at B to the circumcircle.\n\nWe need the slope of the tangent at B. Since the tangent is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center of the circle.\n\nSo if I can compute the center O, then I can find the slope of OB, then take the negative reciprocal for the tangent slope.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the way to go. Let me compute the center O first.\n\nEarlier, we had the equation of the circle as x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nThe center (h,k) is given by ( -D/2, -E/2 ). From the general equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, so here D = -9, E = - (33\u221a14)/28.\n\nThus, center coordinates:\n\nh = -D/2 = 9/2,\n\nk = -E/2 = (33\u221a14)/56.\n\nTherefore, center O is at (9/2, 33\u221a14 /56 ).\n\nHmm, okay. So the center is at (4.5, (33\u221a14)/56). That's still a bit messy, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, the tangent at point B (9,0). The radius OB is the line from O to B. Let me compute the slope of OB.\n\nCoordinates of O: (9/2, 33\u221a14/56 )\n\nCoordinates of B: (9,0).\n\nSo the vector from O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56 ) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56 )\n\nThus, the slope of OB is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) / (9/2 ) = ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) * (2/9 ) = ( -66\u221a14 ) / (504 ) = simplify numerator and denominator by 6: -11\u221a14 /84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the radius OB is -11\u221a14 /84. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at B, which is perpendicular, is the negative reciprocal: (84)/(11\u221a14).\n\nSimplify that: 84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) ) = (6\u221a14)/11. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, reciprocal of slope is 84/(11\u221a14), but slope of tangent is positive reciprocal? Wait, the slope of OB is m = -11\u221a14 /84, so the tangent slope is perpendicular, so m_tangent = -1/m_OB = 84/(11\u221a14). Yes, that's correct. So the tangent at B has slope 84/(11\u221a14).\n\nSimilarly, let's rationalize the denominator:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11. Because 84 divided by 14 is 6. So slope simplifies to (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14 /11, and passes through point B (9,0). So equation is:\n\ny -0 = (6\u221a14 /11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, find the tangent at point C (0,0). Wait, point C is (0,0). Let me compute the tangent at C.\n\nFirst, the radius OC is from center O (9/2, 33\u221a14/56 ) to point C (0,0). The vector is (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56 ). So the slope of OC is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) / (-9/2 ) = ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) * ( -2/9 ) = (66\u221a14)/(504) = simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 11\u221a14 /84. So slope of OC is 11\u221a14 /84.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: -84/(11\u221a14).\n\nAgain, rationalize:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C has slope -6\u221a14 /11 and passes through point C (0,0). So equation is y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x.\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangent lines: the tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo set the two equations equal:\n\nFrom tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14 /11)(x -9)\n\nFrom tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x\n\nSet equal:\n\n(6\u221a14 /11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14 /11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nTherefore, x -9 = -x => 2x =9 => x = 9/2.\n\nThen plug back into tangent at C equation: y = (-6\u221a14 /11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo point D has coordinates (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nHmm, okay. So coordinates of D are (4.5, -27\u221a14 /11).\n\nNow, we need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, let's find parametric equation of line AD.\n\nPoint A is (26/3, 4\u221a14 /3 ), point D is (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 ). Let me write these coordinates as fractions to make calculations easier.\n\nPoint A: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3 )\n\nPoint D: (9/2, (-27\u221a14)/11 )\n\nWe can parametrize line AD as follows. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1 for points from A to D, but since we need the other intersection P, which is beyond A from D's perspective, perhaps parameter t beyond 1?\n\nAlternatively, let me write parametric equations.\n\nLet me denote the direction vector from D to A:\n\n\u0394x = (26/3 - 9/2 ) = (52/6 - 27/6 ) = 25/6.\n\n\u0394y = (4\u221a14 /3 - (-27\u221a14 /11 )) = (4\u221a14 /3 + 27\u221a14 /11 ) = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11 ) = \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 ) = \u221a14*(125/33).\n\nSo the direction vector is (25/6, 125\u221a14 /33 )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write parametric equations starting at D and going towards A, then beyond to P.\n\nLet me let parameter s such that when s=0, we are at D, and s=1 corresponds to A, and then P is at some s = k >1.\n\nSo parametric equations:\n\nx = 9/2 + (25/6)s\n\ny = (-27\u221a14)/11 + (125\u221a14 /33)s\n\nWe need to find the point P where this line intersects the circle \u03c9 again. Since A is already on both the line and the circle, P is the other intersection point.\n\nThe equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nSo substitute x and y from parametric equations into the circle equation and solve for s. Since we know s=1 is a solution (point A), we can factor that out.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write the parametric equations as:\n\nx = 9/2 + (25/6)s,\n\ny = (-27\u221a14)/11 + (125\u221a14 /33)s.\n\nLet me substitute into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nThis substitution will result in a quadratic equation in s, with one root at s=1. The other root will correspond to point P. Then, using Vieta's theorem, the product of the roots s1 and s2 is equal to the constant term divided by the coefficient of s\u00b2. Since one root is s=1, the other can be found accordingly.\n\nThis seems tedious but doable. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute x and y expressions in terms of s.\n\nLet me compute x first:\n\nx = 9/2 + (25/6)s,\n\nSimilarly,\n\ny = (-27\u221a14)/11 + (125\u221a14 /33)s.\n\nLet me compute x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = [9/2 + (25/6)s]^2 = (9/2)^2 + 2*(9/2)*(25/6)s + (25/6 s)^2\n\n= 81/4 + (450/12)s + (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, y\u00b2 = [ (-27\u221a14)/11 + (125\u221a14 /33)s ]^2\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14 from y terms:\n\ny = \u221a14 [ -27/11 + (125/33)s ]\n\nTherefore,\n\ny\u00b2 = 14*[ (-27/11 + (125/33)s ) ]^2\n\nLet me compute the square inside:\n\nLet me denote term inside as A = -27/11 + (125/33)s,\n\nso A = (-27/11) + (125/33)s = (-81/33 + 125/33)s ??? Wait no:\n\nWait, -27/11 = -81/33, and 125/33 is already over 33. So:\n\nA = (-81/33) + (125/33)s = (125s -81)/33.\n\nThus,\n\ny\u00b2 =14*( (125s -81)^2 )/(33)^2.\n\nTherefore, putting back into the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, x\u00b2:\n\n= 81/4 + (450/12)s + (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nSecond term y\u00b2:\n\n=14*( (125s -81)^2 )/(33)^2\n\nThird term: -9x = -9*(9/2 + (25/6)s ) = -81/2 - (225/6)s = -81/2 - 75/2 s\n\nFourth term: - (33\u221a14)/28 y = - (33\u221a14)/28 * [ (-27\u221a14)/11 + (125\u221a14 /33)s ]\n\nLet me compute that term:\n\nFirst, distribute the multiplication:\n\n= - (33\u221a14)/28 * (-27\u221a14)/11 + - (33\u221a14)/28 * (125\u221a14 /33)s\n\nSimplify each part:\n\nFirst part:\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 * (-27\u221a14)/11 = (33*27)/(28*11) * (\u221a14 * \u221a14 )\n\n= ( (33/11)*(27/28) ) * 14\n\nBecause \u221a14 * \u221a14 =14,\n\nSo 33/11 =3, 27/28 stays,\n\nThus, 3*(27/28)*14 = 3*27*(14/28) = 3*27*(1/2) = (81/2).\n\nSecond part:\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 * (125\u221a14 /33)s = - (125/28)*( (\u221a14)^2 ) s\n\n= - (125/28)*14 s = - (125/2)s.\n\nTherefore, the fourth term simplifies to 81/2 - (125/2)s.\n\nPutting all terms together into the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0,\n\nSubstitute each part:\n\n[81/4 + (450/12)s + (625/36)s\u00b2 ] + [14*( (125s -81)^2 )/(33)^2 ] + [ -81/2 -75/2 s ] + [81/2 -125/2 s ] =0.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, the fourth term was - (33\u221a14)/28 y, which simplified to 81/2 - (125/2)s. So adding all terms:\n\nFirst term (x\u00b2):\n\n81/4 + (450/12)s + (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nSecond term (y\u00b2):\n\n14*( (125s -81)^2 )/(33)^2\n\nThird term (-9x):\n\n-81/2 -75/2 s\n\nFourth term (- (33\u221a14)/28 y):\n\n81/2 -125/2 s\n\nAdding all these together equals zero.\n\nLet me combine the constants, the terms with s, and the s\u00b2 terms:\n\nConstants:\n\n81/4 + [from y\u00b2 term] + (-81/2) + 81/2.\n\nThe -81/2 and +81/2 cancel, so constants are 81/4 + [from y\u00b2 term].\n\nWait, actually the y\u00b2 term is a quadratic in s, so the constants will be part of that term. Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should compute each term step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is too time-consuming. Maybe there is a smarter approach?\n\nWait, going back to the Power of a Point. Earlier, I thought DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Since we can compute DA and DB, perhaps we can use that?\n\nWait, yes! Let me recall that Power of Point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nSo if I can compute DA and DB, then I can find DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = DP - DA? Wait, need to check the direction.\n\nWait, since D is outside the circle, and line AD passes through A and then goes to P, so the order is D---A---P. Therefore, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, which is DA + AP. Therefore:\n\nDA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, DA\u00b2 + DA * AP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe can solve for AP:\n\nAP = (DB\u00b2 - DA\u00b2)/DA = (DB\u00b2 / DA ) - DA.\n\nAlternatively, AP = (DB\u00b2 - DA\u00b2)/DA.\n\nThus, if I can compute DA and DB, then AP can be found directly. This is much simpler!\n\nWow, that's a much better approach. I should have thought of this earlier. So let me compute DA and DB.\n\nFirst, compute DB. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, and DB is the length of the tangent from D to the circle, which is equal to DC. So DB = DC. Wait, but we can also compute it directly from coordinates.\n\nWait, but since we have coordinates for D and B, we can compute DB.\n\nPoint D is (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 )\n\nPoint B is (9, 0).\n\nCompute distance DB:\n\n\u0394x = 9 - 9/2 = 9/2,\n\n\u0394y = 0 - (-27\u221a14 /11 ) = 27\u221a14 /11.\n\nThus,\n\nDB = sqrt( (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14 /11)^2 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(9/2)^2 = 81/4,\n\n(27\u221a14 /11)^2 = (27^2)*(14)/(11^2) = 729*14 /121 = 10206 /121.\n\nSo,\n\nDB\u00b2 = 81/4 + 10206/121.\n\nTo add these, find a common denominator. Let me compute:\n\nConvert 81/4 to 81*121/(4*121) = (81*121)/484,\n\nand 10206/121 = (10206*4)/(484).\n\nThus,\n\nDB\u00b2 = [81*121 + 10206*4 ] / 484.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst, 81*121:\n\n81*120 = 9720, plus 81*1 =81, total 9801.\n\nThen 10206*4: 10206*2 =20412, *2 again is 40824.\n\nTotal numerator: 9801 +40824 = 50625.\n\nTherefore, DB\u00b2 = 50625 /484.\n\nThus, DB = sqrt(50625/484) = 225/22.\n\nBecause sqrt(50625)=225, sqrt(484)=22. So DB = 225/22.\n\nSimilarly, compute DA, the distance between D and A.\n\nPoint D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 )\n\nPoint A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 )\n\nCompute \u0394x and \u0394y:\n\n\u0394x = 26/3 - 9/2 = (52/6 - 27/6 ) = 25/6,\n\n\u0394y = (4\u221a14/3 ) - (-27\u221a14/11 ) = 4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11 ) = \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 ) = \u221a14*(125/33 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nDA\u00b2 = (25/6)^2 + ( \u221a14*(125/33) )\u00b2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(25/6)^2 = 625/36,\n\n(\u221a14 *125/33)^2 =14*(125)^2/(33)^2 =14*(15625)/1089 = 218750 /1089.\n\nTherefore,\n\nDA\u00b2 = 625/36 + 218750/1089.\n\nAgain, common denominator is 36*1089 = 39204.\n\nConvert fractions:\n\n625/36 = 625*1089 /39204,\n\n218750/1089 =218750*36 /39204.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst term: 625*1089: Let's compute 625*1000=625000, 625*89=55625, total 625000+55625=680625.\n\nSecond term: 218750*36: 200000*36=7,200,000; 18,750*36=675,000. Total 7,200,000 +675,000 =7,875,000.\n\nTotal numerator: 680,625 +7,875,000 =8,555,625.\n\nTherefore DA\u00b2 =8,555,625 /39,204.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73 =2,851,875,\n\n39,204 \u00f73=13,068.\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n2,851,875 \u00f73= 950,625,\n\n13,068 \u00f73=4,356.\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73=316,875,\n\n4,356 \u00f73=1,452.\n\nDivide by 3 again:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1,452 \u00f73=484.\n\nNow 105,625 /484.\n\nCheck if they have common factors. 105,625 divided by 25 is 4,225, 484 divided by 4 is 121.\n\nWait, 105,625 = 25*4225 =25*(25*169) =25*25*13\u00b2.\n\n484 is 22\u00b2 = (2*11)^2.\n\nHmm, 105625 = 25*4225 =25*(25*169)=25*25*13\u00b2,\n\n484=4*121=4*11\u00b2.\n\nThus, no common factors except perhaps 1. Wait, 105625 and 484:\n\n105625 is divisible by 5, 484 not. So they are co-prime? Wait, 484 is 2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2, 105,625 is 5^4\u00d713\u00b2. So yes, co-prime. Thus,\n\nDA\u00b2 =105625 /484,\n\nTherefore DA = sqrt(105625/484)= 325/22. Since sqrt(105625)=325, sqrt(484)=22.\n\nSo DA = 325/22.\n\nNow, going back to the Power of a Point formula:\n\nDA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nWe have DA = 325/22,\n\nDB\u00b2 = (225/22)^2 = 50625/484,\n\nThus,\n\nDP = (DB\u00b2)/DA = (50625/484) / (325/22 ) = (50625/484)*(22/325).\n\nSimplify:\n\n50625 divided by 325: Let's see:\n\n325 \u00d7 156 = 325\u00d7150 +325\u00d76 =48,750 +1,950 =50,700. Hmm, 50625 is 50,700 -75 = 50,700 -75 =50,625.\n\nThus 50625 =325\u00d7156 -75. Not sure, perhaps better to factor numerator and denominator.\n\n50625 = 225\u00b2,\n\n325 = 25\u00d713,\n\n22 =2\u00d711,\n\n484=22\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n50625/484 *22/325 = (225\u00b2 / 22\u00b2 ) * (22/(25\u00d713)).\n\n= (225\u00b2 *22 ) / (22\u00b2 *25\u00d713 )\n\n= (225\u00b2 ) / (22 *25\u00d713 )\n\n= (225\u00b2)/(22\u00d7325).\n\nWait, maybe cancel 225 and 25:\n\n225 =25\u00d79,\n\nThus,\n\n225\u00b2 = (25\u00d79)^2 =25\u00b2\u00d781,\n\nSo,\n\n(25\u00b2\u00d781)/(22\u00d725\u00d713 ) = (25\u00d781)/(22\u00d713 )\n\n= (2025)/(286).\n\nWait, let me compute 2025 divided by 286.\n\n286 \u00d77 =2002,\n\n2025-2002=23,\n\nThus, 2025/286 =7 +23/286 =7 + (23/286). Hmm, but perhaps simplifying:\n\n2025 and 286: GCD?\n\n2025 \u00f75=405, 286 \u00f72=143, so no common factors. So 2025/286 is simplified.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again:\n\nWait, the DP expression is:\n\nDP = (50625/484)*(22/325)\n\nLet me compute numerator: 50625 *22,\n\nDenominator:484 *325,\n\n50625 *22: 50625*20=1,012,500; 50625*2=101,250 \u2192 total 1,113,750.\n\nDenominator:484 *325.\n\n484*300=145,200,\n\n484*25=12,100,\n\nTotal:145,200+12,100=157,300.\n\nThus DP =1,113,750 /157,300.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 10: 111,375 /15,730.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 22,275 /3,146.\n\nCheck if divisible by 13: 3146 \u00f713: 13\u00d7242=3146, so yes.\n\n22,275 \u00f713: 13\u00d71713=22,269, so 22,275-22,269=6. So not divisible by 13. Hmm, maybe other factors?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, 484 * 325: 484*300 is 145,200 and 484*25 is 12,100, total 157,300. Correct.\n\n50625*22=50,625*22. Wait, 50,625*20=1,012,500, plus 50,625*2=101,250 \u2192 total 1,113,750. Correct.\n\nSo DP = 1,113,750 /157,300. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 50: numerator 22,275, denominator 3,146. Then, check GCD of 22275 and 3146.\n\nDivide 3146 into 22275:\n\n3146 \u00d77=22,022,\n\n22275 -22,022 =253.\n\nThen GCD(3146,253). 3146 \u00f7253=12.44, 253\u00d712=3036, 3146-3036=110,\n\nGCD(253,110). 253 \u00f7110=2.3, 110\u00d72=220, 253-220=33,\n\nGCD(110,33)=11,\n\nThus GCD is 11. So 253=11\u00d723, 110=11\u00d710,\n\nThus GCD(22275,3146)=11?\n\nWait, let's see 22275 \u00f711: 11\u00d72025=22,275. Yes, 11\u00d72025=22,275. And 3146 \u00f711=286. So yes, GCD is 11.\n\nTherefore,\n\n22275/3146 = (22275 \u00f711)/(3146 \u00f711)=2025/286.\n\nSo DP =2025/286.\n\nTherefore, AP = DP - DA ?\n\nWait, need to confirm the direction. Since DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, and since P is on the extension beyond A from D, then AP = DP - DA.\n\nYes, because DP = DA + AP \u21d2 AP = DP - DA.\n\nTherefore,\n\nAP = (2025/286) - (325/22).\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 286 (since 22\u00d713=286).\n\n325/22 = (325\u00d713)/286 = 4225/286.\n\nThus,\n\nAP =2025/286 -4225/286 = (2025 -4225)/286 = (-2200)/286.\n\nWait, that gives a negative value? That can't be. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I messed up the direction. Let me check:\n\nIf D is outside the circle, and line AD goes from D through A to P, then the length DP is DA + AP. So AP = DP - DA. But if DP is shorter than DA, then AP would be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, likely a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck the Power of a Point formula. The Power of a Point D with respect to the circle is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nSo DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nSo DP = DB\u00b2 / DA,\n\nWe have DB =225/22,\n\nso DB squared is (225/22)^2 =50625/484,\n\nDA is 325/22,\n\nThus DP = (50625/484)/(325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325)= (50625*22)/(484*325).\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\n50625*22 = 50625*20 +50625*2 =1,012,500 +101,250 =1,113,750.\n\nDenominator:484*325. Let me compute 484*300=145,200; 484*25=12,100; total 157,300.\n\nThus, DP=1,113,750 /157,300.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 50: 22,275 /3,146,\n\nThen as before, divide numerator and denominator by GCD 11:2025/286.\n\n2025 divided by 286 is approximately 7.08,\n\n325/22\u224814.77,\n\nWait, but DP \u22487.08, which is less than DA\u224814.77. That can't be, since DP should be longer than DA because P is on the extension beyond A from D.\n\nHmm, so this suggests a miscalculation.\n\nWait a second, maybe I messed up DA's calculation?\n\nLet me re-calculate DA.\n\nDA is the distance between D (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 ) and A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 ).\n\n\u0394x =26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6,\n\n\u0394y =4\u221a14/3 - (-27\u221a14/11 ) =4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11,\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nConvert to common denominator 33:\n\n4\u221a14/3 =44\u221a14/33,\n\n27\u221a14/11 =81\u221a14/33,\n\nTotal \u0394y = (44 +81)\u221a14 /33 =125\u221a14 /33.\n\nTherefore, \u0394y squared is (125\u221a14 /33 )\u00b2 = (125\u00b2 *14)/33\u00b2 = (15625 *14)/1089 =218,750 /1089,\n\n\u0394x squared is (25/6)^2 =625/36.\n\nThus DA squared is 625/36 +218,750/1089,\n\nConvert to common denominator 39204 (which is 36\u00d71089):\n\n625/36 = (625\u00d71089)/39204,\n\n218,750/1089 = (218,750\u00d736)/39204,\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n625\u00d71089: Let's compute 600\u00d71089=653,400; 25\u00d71089=27,225 \u2192 total 653,400 +27,225 =680,625.\n\n218,750\u00d736: 200,000\u00d736=7,200,000; 18,750\u00d736=675,000 \u2192 total 7,875,000.\n\nTotal numerator:680,625 +7,875,000=8,555,625,\n\nThus DA squared =8,555,625 /39,204,\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73 =2,851,875,\n\n39,204 \u00f73=13,068,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n2,851,875 \u00f73=950,625,\n\n13,068 \u00f73=4,356,\n\nDivide by 3 again:\n\n950,625 \u00f73=316,875,\n\n4,356 \u00f73=1,452,\n\nDivide by 3 again:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1,452 \u00f73=484.\n\nThus DA squared =105,625 /484,\n\nSo DA is sqrt(105,625)/sqrt(484) = 325/22 \u224814.77.\n\nOkay that's correct.\n\nThen DP = DB squared / DA = (50,625/484)/(325/22) = (50,625/484)*(22/325).\n\nCompute numerator:50,625\u00d722=1,113,750,\n\nDenominator:484\u00d7325=157,300,\n\nThus DP=1,113,750 /157,300 \u22487.08.\n\nWait, but that would mean DP is less than DA, which contradicts the Power of a Point since D is outside, so DP must be longer than DA.\n\nHmm, so something is wrong here. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the Power of a Point formula.\n\nWait, the Power of a Point D with respect to the circle is equal to DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nBut if DP is the length from D to P, and the points are ordered D---A---P, then DP = DA + AP,\n\nThus DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2,\n\nSo DA\u00b2 + DA*AP = DB\u00b2,\n\nHence AP = (DB\u00b2 - DA\u00b2)/DA,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = ( (50625/484 ) - (105625/484 )) / (325/22 )\n\nWait, wait, hold on:\n\nWait, DA squared is 105625/484,\n\nDB squared is 50625/484,\n\nSo DB squared - DA squared = (50625 -105625)/484 = (-55,000)/484,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = (negative number)/ (325/22 ) which would be negative, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, that can't be. So this suggests that my calculation is wrong, but where?\n\nWait, the Power of a Point formula states that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nBut if the line DA passes through the circle, then the two intersections are A and P, so the Power of a Point formula is indeed DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nBut if DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, then since P is further from D than A, DP must be greater than DA, so DA * DP must be greater than DA\u00b2,\n\nBut according to the numbers,\n\nDA squared is 105,625 /484 \u2248 218.6,\n\nDB squared is 50,625 /484 \u2248104.6,\n\nSo DA squared is greater than DB squared, which would mean DA * DP = DB\u00b2 implies DP = DB\u00b2 / DA \u2248104.6 /14.77\u22487.08,\n\nBut DA is 14.77, so DP is smaller than DA, which contradicts the external point.\n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the calculation of DB squared or DA squared.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate DB squared.\n\nPoint D is (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 ),\n\nPoint B is (9,0).\n\n\u0394x =9 - 9/2 =9/2,\n\n\u0394y =0 - (-27\u221a14 /11 )=27\u221a14 /11,\n\nThus,\n\nDB squared = (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14 /11 )^2,\n\n(9/2)^2 =81/4 =20.25,\n\n(27\u221a14 /11 )^2 = (27^2)*(14)/(11^2)=729*14/121,\n\n729*14: 700*14=9800, 29*14=406 \u2192 total 10,206,\n\nThus, 10,206 /121 \u224884.347,\n\nThus total DB squared is 20.25 +84.347\u2248104.597,\n\nWhich is roughly 104.6, as before.\n\nDA squared is (325/22)^2 \u2248(14.77)^2\u2248218.15,\n\nThus DA squared is indeed larger than DB squared, which contradicts the Power of a Point formula. Since Power of a Point D is DA * DP = DB squared,\n\nIf DA * DP = DB squared,\n\nBut DA is longer than DB, so DP must be less than DB,\n\nBut since D is outside, the point P should be on the extension beyond A from D, so DP must be greater than DA,\n\nThis is a contradiction, so something is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps my coordinates are wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the coordinates of point D?\n\nLet me re-calculate the coordinates of D.\n\nWe had the tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9),\n\nand tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x,\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14 /11)x,\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\n(x -9) = -x,\n\nThus 2x =9 \u21d2x=9/2,\n\nThen y = (-6\u221a14 /11)*(9/2) = (-27\u221a14)/11,\n\nSo that's correct. So coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nHmm. Then coordinates are correct.\n\nWait, but the Power of a Point formula must hold. If DA * DP = DB squared,\n\nBut according to the values, DA\u224814.77, DB squared\u2248104.6,\n\nThus DP\u2248104.6 /14.77\u22487.08,\n\nWhich would mean that P is between D and A, but since A is on the circle, P should be the other intersection, so beyond A from D,\n\nHence DP must be greater than DA,\n\nThis is impossible, so there must be a miscalculation in coordinates or in the Power of a Point setup.\n\nWait, perhaps my direction is reversed. Maybe the Power of a Point is actually DP * DA = DB squared,\n\nBut in Power of a Point, it's the product of the entire lengths. Wait, let me recall:\n\nIf a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D,\n\nHere, the line AD intersects the circle at A and P,\n\nThus DA * DP = power,\n\nBut DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P,\n\nBut if the points are D---A---P,\n\nThen DA * DP = power,\n\nBut if P is beyond A, then DP = DA + AP,\n\nHence DA*(DA + AP ) = power,\n\nThus AP = (power / DA ) - DA,\n\nBut if power < DA squared,\n\nThen AP would be negative,\n\nWhich is impossible,\n\nSo this suggests that the Power of D is negative,\n\nWait, but Power of a Point outside the circle should be positive,\n\nWait, but in our case, the Power of D is DB squared,\n\nDB is the length of the tangent from D to the circle,\n\nWhich should be positive,\n\nThus, DB squared must be equal to DA * DP,\n\nBut if DA * DP must be equal to DB squared,\n\nBut in our case DA squared > DB squared,\n\nHence DP < DA,\n\nThus the other intersection point P is between D and A,\n\nBut A is already on the circle,\n\nHence P coincides with A,\n\nBut that can't be,\n\nWait, this is a problem,\n\nHmm,\n\nWait a second, perhaps my parametrization was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps in my coordinate system, point D is inside the circle?\n\nWait, let's check if point D is inside or outside the circle.\n\nCompute the power of D with respect to the circle:\n\nThe power is DB squared, which is equal to the power,\n\nBut also, the power can be computed as OD\u00b2 - R\u00b2,\n\nWhere O is the center,\n\nIf power is positive, then D is outside,\n\nCompute the coordinates of O:\n\nO is at (9/2, 33\u221a14 /56 ),\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 ),\n\nCompute vector OD:\n\n\u0394x =0,\n\n\u0394y = -27\u221a14 /11 -33\u221a14 /56 = \u221a14*(-27/11 -33/56 ).\n\nCompute -27/11 -33/56:\n\nCommon denominator 616 (11*56):\n\n-27/11 = -27*56 /616 = -1512 /616,\n\n-33/56 = -33*11 /616 = -363 /616,\n\nTotal: -1512 -363 = -1875 /616,\n\nThus \u0394y = \u221a14*(-1875/616),\n\nThus,\n\nOD squared = (0)^2 + (\u0394y)^2 = ( (\u221a14 * (-1875/616) )^2 ) =14*(1875/616)^2.\n\nCompute R squared: (75\u221a14 /56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/56^2 = (5625 *14)/3136 =78750/3136 \u224825.12.\n\nCompute OD squared:\n\n14*(1875/616)^2,\n\nFirst compute 1875/616 \u22483.044,\n\nSquared is \u22489.268,\n\nMultiply by 14 \u2248129.75,\n\nThus OD squared\u2248129.75,\n\nR squared\u224825.12,\n\nThus power = OD\u00b2 - R\u00b2\u2248129.75 -25.12\u2248104.63,\n\nWhich matches DB squared\u2248104.6,\n\nThus D is outside the circle,\n\nTherefore, the Power of a Point is positive,\n\nBut according to coordinates, DA * DP = DB squared,\n\nBut if DP < DA, then P is between D and A,\n\nBut since A is on the circle, then the other intersection must be on the other side,\n\nWait, perhaps my parametrization is wrong,\n\nWait, in coordinates, point A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 ) \u2248 (8.666, 4.4899),\n\nPoint D is (4.5, -27\u221a14 /11 ) \u2248(4.5, -27*3.7417/11 ) \u2248(4.5, -9.423),\n\nThus the line from D to A goes from (4.5, -9.423) to (8.666,4.4899),\n\nAnd the circle is centered at (4.5, 33\u221a14 /56 ) \u2248 (4.5, (33*3.7417)/56 )\u2248 (4.5, 2.197),\n\nSo the center is at (4.5, ~2.197). The point D is below the center, at (4.5, -9.423),\n\nSo the line DA goes from D upwards through A, which is above the center,\n\nThe circle has a radius of about sqrt(OD\u00b2 - power?) Wait, the radius squared is R\u00b2 = (75\u221a14 /56 )^2 \u224825.12,\n\nSo radius \u22485.01,\n\nThe center is at (4.5, ~2.197),\n\nPoint A is at (8.666, ~4.4899), which is distance from center:\n\nsqrt( (8.666-4.5)^2 + (4.4899 -2.197)^2 )\u2248sqrt( (4.166)^2 + (2.293)^2 )\u2248sqrt(17.36 +5.26)=sqrt(22.62)\u22484.75,\n\nWhich is less than radius 5.01? Wait, but A is supposed to be on the circle,\n\nWait, hold on, the coordinates of A were computed as (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 ). Let me verify if this lies on the circle equation.\n\nThe circle equation was x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0,\n\nPlugging in A's coordinates:\n\nx=26/3, y=4\u221a14/3,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (676/9) + (16*14)/9 = (676 + 224)/9 =900/9=100,\n\nThen -9x = -9*(26/3)= -78,\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 y = - (33\u221a14)/28*(4\u221a14/3 ) = - (33*4*14)/(28*3 ) = - (33*4*14)/(84 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n33 and 84 have a common factor of 3: 33/3=11, 84/3=28,\n\nThus, - (11*4*14)/28 = - (56*14)/28 = - (56/28)*14 = -2*14 = -28,\n\nThus total equation:\n\n100 -78 -28 = -6 \u22600.\n\nWait a second! This can't be. This means that point A is not on the circle. That's a problem. Which means I made a mistake in calculating the circle equation.\n\nWait, that's a critical mistake. The coordinates of A were computed based on the triangle sides, but when plugged into the circle equation, they don't satisfy it. That means I messed up the circle equation.\n\nLet me backtrack. When I computed the circle equation, I might have made an error.\n\nRecall that after finding the center (9/2, 33\u221a14/56 ), I should verify if point A lies on the circle.\n\nWait, perhaps my mistake was in calculating the center.\n\nLet me recalculate the center.\n\nGiven three points A(26/3,4\u221a14/3), B(9,0), C(0,0),\n\nWe can compute the circumcircle using perpendicular bisectors.\n\nFirst, find the perpendicular bisector of AB and AC.\n\nLet me compute the midpoint of AB:\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3,4\u221a14/3),\n\nCoordinates of B: (9,0).\n\nMidpoint M_AB: ( (26/3 +9)/2, (4\u221a14/3 +0)/2 )\n\nConvert 9 to 27/3,\n\n26/3 +27/3 =53/3,\n\nThus x-coordinate: (53/3)/2 =53/6 \u22488.833,\n\ny-coordinate: (4\u221a14/3)/2=2\u221a14/3 \u2248 2.993.\n\nSlope of AB:\n\n\u0394y =0 -4\u221a14/3 = -4\u221a14/3,\n\n\u0394x =9 -26/3 = (27/3 -26/3)=1/3,\n\nSlope of AB: (-4\u221a14/3)/(1/3)= -4\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB has slope 1/(4\u221a14).\n\nThus, equation of perpendicular bisector of AB:\n\nUsing point M_AB (53/6, 2\u221a14/3 ),\n\ny -2\u221a14/3 = (1/(4\u221a14))(x -53/6 )\n\nSimilarly, find perpendicular bisector of AC.\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3,4\u221a14/3),\n\nCoordinates of C: (0,0).\n\nMidpoint M_AC: (13/3, 2\u221a14/3 ).\n\nSlope of AC:\n\n\u0394y =4\u221a14/3 -0 =4\u221a14/3,\n\n\u0394x =26/3 -0 =26/3,\n\nSlope of AC: (4\u221a14/3)/(26/3)= (4\u221a14)/26= (2\u221a14)/13.\n\nPerpendicular slope is -13/(2\u221a14).\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of AC through M_AC (13/3, 2\u221a14/3):\n\ny -2\u221a14/3 = (-13/(2\u221a14))(x -13/3 )\n\nNow, find intersection point of the two perpendicular bisectors to get the center O.\n\nFirst, let's write both equations clearly.\n\nPerpendicular bisector of AB:\n\ny = (1/(4\u221a14))(x -53/6 ) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nPerpendicular bisector of AC:\n\ny = (-13/(2\u221a14))(x -13/3 ) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nLet me compute both equations step by step.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nLet me denote slope m1 =1/(4\u221a14),\n\nintercept term: m1*(-53/6 ) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nThus,\n\ny = [x/(4\u221a14)] - (53)/(24\u221a14) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nSecond equation:\n\nSlope m2 =-13/(2\u221a14),\n\nintercept term: m2*(-13/3 ) + 2\u221a14/3,\n\nThus,\n\ny = [-13/(2\u221a14) x] + (169)/(6\u221a14) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nNow, set the two equations equal:\n\n[x/(4\u221a14)] - (53)/(24\u221a14) + 2\u221a14/3 = [-13/(2\u221a14) x] + (169)/(6\u221a14) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nSubtract 2\u221a14/3 from both sides:\n\n[x/(4\u221a14)] - (53)/(24\u221a14) = [-13/(2\u221a14)x] + 169/(6\u221a14).\n\nMultiply all terms by 24\u221a14 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24\u221a14*[x/(4\u221a14)] -24\u221a14*(53)/(24\u221a14) =24\u221a14*[ -13/(2\u221a14)x ] +24\u221a14*(169)/(6\u221a14).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 24\u221a14/(4\u221a14) x =6x,\n\nSecond term: -53,\n\nThird term:24\u221a14*(-13)/(2\u221a14)x = -24*13/2 x =-156x,\n\nFourth term:24\u221a14*(169)/(6\u221a14)=24/6 *169 =4*169=676.\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n6x -53 = -156x +676,\n\nBring variables to left and constants to right:\n\n6x +156x =676 +53,\n\n162x =729,\n\nx=729/162= 729 \u00f781=9; 162 \u00f781=2 \u2192 9/2=4.5.

No, that complicates.\n\nAlternatively, rationalize or compute numerically.\n\nAlternatively, multiply numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me compute:\n\ny = (2\u221a14)/3 -13/(12\u221a14).\n\nLet me get a common denominator of 12\u221a14:\n\nFirst term: (2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(3 *4\u221a14) = (8*14)/(12\u221a14) = 112/(12\u221a14),\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me write both terms over denominator 12\u221a14:\n\nFirst term: -13/(12\u221a14),\n\nSecond term: (2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(3 *4\u221a14) = (8*14)/(12\u221a14). Wait, this approach may not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, compute numerically:\n\nFirst term: -13/(12\u221a14) \u2248-13/(12*3.7417)\u2248-13/44.9\u2248-0.29,\n\nSecond term:2\u221a14/3\u22482*3.7417/3\u22487.4834/3\u22482.494,\n\nTotal y\u2248-0.29+2.494\u22482.204,\n\nWhich is approximately the center's y-coordinate we had before (33\u221a14 /56 \u2248 (33*3.7417)/56\u2248123.48 /56\u22482.205). So that matches.\n\nThus, center is indeed (9/2, 33\u221a14/56 ).\n\nBut when we plug point A into the circle equation, it didn't satisfy. Let me check again.\n\nEquation of the circle: (x - 9/2)^2 + (y - 33\u221a14/56 )^2 = R\u00b2,\n\nWhere R is the distance from center to A:\n\nCompute R squared:\n\n\u0394x =26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6,\n\n\u0394y =4\u221a14/3 -33\u221a14/56 = \u221a14*(4/3 -33/56).\n\nCompute 4/3 -33/56:\n\nCommon denominator 168,\n\n4/3 =224/168,\n\n33/56=99/168,\n\nThus 224/168 -99/168 =125/168,\n\nThus \u0394y =\u221a14*(125/168),\n\nThus,\n\nR squared = (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14 /168 )^2,\n\nCompute:\n\n(25/6)^2 =625/36,\n\n(125\u221a14 /168 )^2 = (125^2 *14)/(168^2)= (15625*14)/(28224)=218,750/28224\u22487.75.\n\nSo R squared\u2248625/36\u224817.36 +7.75\u224825.11,\n\nWhich matches previous calculation.\n\nNow plug point A into the circle equation:\n\n(x -9/2)^2 + (y -33\u221a14/56)^2 should equal R squared\u224825.11.\n\nCompute (x -9/2)^2:\n\nx=26/3, so 26/3 -9/2 = (52-27)/6 =25/6,\n\nSo squared is625/36\u224817.36,\n\n(y -33\u221a14/56)^2:\n\ny=4\u221a14/3,\n\nThus,\n\n4\u221a14/3 -33\u221a14/56 =\u221a14*(4/3 -33/56)=\u221a14*( (224 -99)/168 )=\u221a14*(125/168),\n\nSquared is (125\u00b2 *14)/(168\u00b2)= same as before,\n\nThus total is indeed 625/36 +218,750/28224 \u224817.36 +7.75\u224825.11,\n\nWhich matches R squared.\n\nTherefore, point A is on the circle. The previous error was in my initial circle equation computation where I had an incorrect sign for the E term.\n\nEarlier, I computed E as -33\u221a14/28, but when plugging into the general equation, the term was - (33\u221a14)/28 y,\n\nWhich would mean that the circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0,\n\nBut when I plugged in point A:\n\nx=26/3, y=4\u221a14/3,\n\nThe terms were:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100,\n\n-9x = -78,\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 y = - (33\u221a14)/28*(4\u221a14/3 ) = - (33*4*14)/(28*3 ) = - (33*4*14)/(84 ) = - (33*56)/84 = - (33* (56/84 )) = - (33*(2/3 )) = -22,\n\nThus total equation:\n\n100 -78 -22 =0,\n\nWhich works! I must have miscalculated before. Earlier I thought it didn't work, but actually it does.\n\nTherefore, my mistake was in the previous calculation where I incorrectly computed the term:\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 y,\n\nI must have messed up the arithmetic earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates are correct.\n\nThus, returning to the Power of a Point:\n\nDA * DP = DB squared,\n\nWith DA =325/22\u224814.77,\n\nDB squared = (225/22)^2\u2248 (10.227)^2\u2248104.6,\n\nThus,\n\nDP = (DB squared)/DA \u2248104.6/14.77\u22487.08,\n\nBut since DP must be greater than DA for P to be beyond A, this is a contradiction,\n\nWait, but according to coordinates,\n\nIf the center is at (4.5, ~2.2),\n\nPoint D is at (4.5, ~-9.4),\n\nLine DA goes from D upwards to A (8.666,4.4899),\n\nBeyond A would be further away from D,\n\nSo the distance from D to P should be greater than DA,\n\nBut according to calculation, it's smaller,\n\nThus, my mistake must be in the Power of a Point formula,\n\nWait, the Power of a Point formula for external point D is:\n\nDA * DP = DB squared,\n\nBut DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P,\n\nBut if P is on the other side of the circle from D, then DP would be the distance from D to P through the circle,\n\nWait, but in the line DA, A is between D and P,\n\nThus DP is DA + AP,\n\nThus,\n\nDA*(DA + AP) = DB squared,\n\nWhich gives AP = (DB squared / DA ) - DA,\n\nWhich in this case would be:\n\nAP = (50625/484 divided by 325/22 ) - 325/22,\n\nCompute:\n\n50625/484 divided by 325/22 is (50625/484)*(22/325)=2025/286 \u22487.08,\n\nThen subtract 325/22\u224814.77,\n\nAP =7.08 -14.77\u2248-7.69,\n\nNegative, which is impossible,\n\nThus, there's a fundamental mistake in the Power of a Point application,\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is DP * DA = power,\n\nBut if the point is outside, and the line passes through the circle, then the power is equal to DA * DP,\n\nBut if the point is outside, and the line intersects the circle at two points, say A and P, with A closer to D,\n\nThen DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P,\n\nThus DA * DP = power,\n\nBut in that case, DP > DA,\n\nSo the formula holds,\n\nBut in our case,\n\nDA \u224814.77,\n\nDP\u22487.08,\n\nWhich is less than DA,\n\nThus, the formula would give a smaller power,\n\nBut according to the coordinates, the power should be DB squared\u2248104.6,\n\nDA * DP\u224814.77 *7.08\u2248104.6,\n\nWhich matches,\n\nBut geometrically, this would mean that P is between D and A,\n\nBut A is already on the circle,\n\nHence P is the same as A,\n\nBut that can't be,\n\nWait, perhaps the other intersection point is behind D?\n\nWait, the line AD starts at D, goes through A, and then exits the circle at another point P beyond A,\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, DP is shorter than DA,\n\nThis is a contradiction,\n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the coordinate calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my parametrization is inverted,\n\nWait, in the parametrization earlier,\n\nI had parametrized from D to A as s from 0 to1,\n\nThus P would be at s= k>1,\n\nThus DP = s * direction vector,\n\nBut perhaps the distance DP is not just the parameter multiplied by the length,\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express AP in terms of DP and DA.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my mistake was in the Power of a Point formula.\n\nWait, let me look up the Power of a Point theorem.\n\nPower of a Point outside the circle: If a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = power.\n\nIf D is outside, and the line passes through the circle, then one of the points is closer (X) and the other is farther (Y),\n\nThus DX * DY = power,\n\nIn our case, points are D---X---Y,\n\nThus DY = DX + XY,\n\nThus DX * (DX + XY ) = power,\n\nBut in our notation, if A is the closer point (X), then DA * DP = power,\n\nWith DP = DA + AP,\n\nThus DA*(DA + AP)= power,\n\nWhich gives AP = (power / DA ) - DA,\n\nBut if power < DA\u00b2,\n\nThen AP negative,\n\nWhich suggests that the other intersection point is between D and A,\n\nBut since A is on the circle, the other intersection must be on the other side,\n\nThus, perhaps the parametrization is such that P is between D and A,\n\nBut that would mean the line AD intersects the circle at A and P between D and A,\n\nHence AP is negative,\n\nBut geometrically, that's possible if the line AD enters the circle at P (closer to D) and exits at A,\n\nHence the two points are P and A,\n\nWith DP < DA,\n\nThus the Power of a Point formula holds,\n\nBut then AP would be negative,\n\nBut since we are asked for the length AP,\n\nWe can take absolute value,\n\nThus AP = | DP - DA | = DA - DP,\n\nBut then AP = DA - DP = DA - (DB squared / DA )\n\n= (DA\u00b2 - DB squared)/DA,\n\nWhich would be positive,\n\nYes, that makes sense,\n\nBecause:\n\nDA * DP = DB squared,\n\n=> DP = DB squared / DA,\n\nAP = DA - DP,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = DA - (DB squared / DA ) = (DA\u00b2 - DB squared)/DA,\n\nWhich is positive since DA\u00b2 > DB squared,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = (DA squared - DB squared)/DA,\n\nTherefore, AP = ( (105625/484 ) - (50625/484 )) / (325/22 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n105,625 -50,625 =55,000,\n\nThus numerator is 55,000 /484,\n\nDivided by (325/22 ):\n\n(55,000 /484 ) * (22/325 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n55,000 *22 =1,210,000,\n\n484 *325 =157,300,\n\nThus,\n\nAP =1,210,000 /157,300,\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100:12,100 /1,573,\n\nCheck GCD of 12100 and 1573:\n\n1573 \u00f7121=13,\n\n12100 \u00f7121=100,\n\nThus,\n\n12100 =121\u00d7100,\n\n1573=121\u00d713,\n\nThus,\n\nAP= (121\u00d7100)/(121\u00d713 ) =100/13,\n\nSo AP=100/13,\n\nThus m=100, n=13, which are coprime,\n\nHence m +n=113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the parts. It says:\n\nLet ABC be a triangle inscribed in circle \u03c9. The tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D. Then the line AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. We're given the sides AB = 5, BC = 9, and AC = 10. We need to find AP in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n.\n\nHmm, okay. So first, let me try to visualize this. There's triangle ABC inscribed in a circle, so it's a cyclic triangle. The tangents at B and C meet at point D. Then connecting A to D, this line meets the circle again at P. We need the length AP. The sides are given, so maybe using some triangle properties, circle theorems, or perhaps power of a point?\n\nLet me recall some theorems. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then DB = DC because the lengths of tangents from a common point to a circle are equal. So D is equidistant from B and C, and lies along the angle bisector of angle BAC? Wait, no, actually, the intersection point of two tangents to a circle lies along the symmedian of the triangle. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.\n\nAlternatively, power of a point D with respect to circle \u03c9. The power of D should be equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DB * DC (but they are equal, so DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2). Since D lies outside the circle, the power is also equal to DA * DP, because AD is a secant line passing through P. Wait, yes, Power of a Point says that for a point outside the circle, the product of the lengths from the point to the intersection points with the circle is equal for any secant line. So here, Power of D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. That seems important.\n\nSo if I can find DA and DP, but actually, since we need AP, which is DA - DP if D is outside and P is on the other side of A. Wait, but depending on the configuration. Let me think.\n\nWait, actually, Power of a Point formula is: If a line through D intersects the circle at two points X and Y, then DX * DY is equal to the power of D. Here, line AD intersects the circle at A and P, so DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Since D is outside, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. So DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Therefore, if I can find DB and DA, then I can solve for DP, then AP would be DP - DA? Wait, no. Wait, let's think carefully.\n\nSuppose point D is outside the circle. Then the line AD starts at D, goes through A, and then meets the circle again at P. So the order is D---A---P on the line. Therefore, DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but DP is the distance from D to P, which would be DA + AP. Wait, actually, the Power of a Point formula states that DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Here, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. Since A is between D and P, then DP = DA + AP. Therefore, substituting:\n\nDA * (DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nBut we need to find AP, so let's denote AP as x. Then DP = DA + x, so:\n\nDA*(DA + x) = DB\u00b2 => DA\u00b2 + DA*x = DB\u00b2.\n\nBut we have two variables here: DA and x (AP). So we need another equation. Hmm. Maybe we can find DA in terms of the sides of the triangle?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use coordinates or trigonometry. Alternatively, maybe using inversion or other methods, but that might be more complex. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using triangle areas or the Law of Cosines. Since the sides of the triangle are given, perhaps we can compute some angles or other lengths.\n\nAlternatively, since ABC is inscribed in a circle, maybe using the Law of Sines. Let me try to compute the circumradius first. Maybe that could help?\n\nWait, the circumradius R of triangle ABC can be found using the formula:\n\nR = (a*b*c)/(4*\u0394),\n\nwhere a, b, c are the sides, and \u0394 is the area. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, let me note the sides: AB = 5, BC = 9, AC = 10. Let me denote the sides as follows: Let\u2019s let BC = a = 9, AC = b = 10, AB = c = 5. Wait, standard notation is usually a opposite angle A, but maybe I should confirm. Wait, in standard notation, a is BC, opposite angle A; b is AC opposite angle B; c is AB opposite angle C. Wait, perhaps I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe just compute the area using Heron's formula first.\n\nCompute semi-perimeter, s = (5 + 9 + 10)/2 = (24)/2 = 12.\n\nArea \u0394 = \u221a[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)] = \u221a[12*(12 - 5)(12 - 9)(12 - 10)] = \u221a[12*7*3*2] = \u221a[12*7*6] = \u221a[504] = \u221a[16*31.5]? Wait, no, 12*7*3*2: 12*7 is 84, 84*3 is 252, 252*2 is 504. So sqrt(504). Let me factor that: 504 = 16 * 31.5? Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5? Wait, 16*31 is 496, so maybe better to factor into primes:\n\n504 = 2^3 * 3^2 * 7. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, let's see:\n\nsqrt(504) = sqrt( 16 * 31.5 ) but that's messy. Let me do prime factors again:\n\n504 divided by 2 is 252\n\n252 divided by 2 is 126\n\n126 divided by 2 is 63\n\n63 divided by 3 is 21\n\n21 divided by 3 is 7\n\nSo factors are 2^3, 3^2, 7^1.\n\nThus sqrt(2^3 * 3^2 *7) = 2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7) = 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Wait, sqrt(2^3) is 2*sqrt(2), sqrt(3^2) is 3, sqrt(7) is sqrt(7). So yes, 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7) = 6*sqrt(14). Therefore area \u0394 = 6\u221a14.\n\nSo then the circumradius R is (a*b*c)/(4\u0394) = (9*10*5)/(4*6\u221a14) = 450/(24\u221a14) = 75/(4\u221a14). Let me rationalize denominator: 75\u221a14/(4*14) = 75\u221a14/56. Hmm, so R = 75\u221a14 / 56. Not sure if that helps yet, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates. Let me try to set up coordinate system.\n\nLet me consider placing triangle ABC in coordinate plane. Let me set point C at the origin (0,0) to simplify. Let me let point B be at (9, 0), but wait, but BC is 9? Wait, AC is 10, BC is 9, AB is 5. Hmm, maybe better to set coordinates so that calculations are easier.\n\nAlternatively, let me set point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0), since BC is 9. Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me denote coordinates:\n\nLet\u2019s set coordinate system with point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0). Then point A has coordinates (x,y) such that AC = 10 and AB =5.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nPoint C: (0,0)\n\nPoint B: (9,0)\n\nPoint A: (x,y). Then AC = 10: sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100.\n\nAB = 5: distance from A to B (9,0): sqrt( (x -9)^2 + y^2 ) =5, so (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25.\n\nWe can solve these equations to find coordinates of A.\n\nSubtract the two equations:\n\n(x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 -100 => (x\u00b2 -18x +81 + y\u00b2) - x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -75 => -18x +81 = -75 => -18x = -156 => x = 156/18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nSo x = 26/3. Then plug back into x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100:\n\n(26/3)^2 + y\u00b2 =100.\n\n26 squared is 676, so (676/9) + y\u00b2 = 100 => y\u00b2 =100 - 676/9 = (900 -676)/9 = 224/9. So y = \u00b1\u221a(224/9) = \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(2\u221a56)/3 = \u00b1(2*2\u221a14)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3.\n\nHmm, so point A is at (26/3, 4\u221a14/3) or (26/3, -4\u221a14/3). Since the triangle is inscribed in a circle, the position depends on orientation. Let's assume it's above the x-axis, so take positive y-coordinate. So coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3).\n\nOkay, so coordinates:\n\nA: (26/3, 4\u221a14/3)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nNow, need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, let's find equations for the tangents at B and C.\n\nTo find the tangent lines at points B and C on the circumcircle \u03c9. Since we have coordinates for A, B, C, we can find the equation of the circumcircle, then find the tangent lines.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates, perhaps compute the circumcircle equation first.\n\nLet me compute the circumcircle equation. Let me recall that the general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nWe can plug in the coordinates of A, B, C to find D, E, F.\n\nPoint C is (0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 => F =0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nPoint B (9,0):\n\n81 +0 +9D +0 +0 =0 => 81 +9D =0 => D = -81/9 = -9.\n\nSo D = -9.\n\nPoint A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\n( (26/3)^2 + ( (4\u221a14)/3 )^2 ) + (-9)(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (26/3)^2 = (676)/9\n\nSecond term: ( (4\u221a14)/3 )^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9\n\nSo total first part: (676 + 224)/9 = 900/9 = 100.\n\nSecond part: -9*(26/3) = -78\n\nThird part: E*(4\u221a14/3)\n\nSo altogether:\n\n100 -78 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 => 22 + (4\u221a14/3) E =0 => (4\u221a14/3) E = -22 => E = (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14). Rationalize denominator:\n\nE = (-33)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-33\u221a14)/(28).\n\nThus, the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using parametric equations for the tangents at B and C.\n\nAlternatively, the tangent at a point (x\u2080,y\u2080) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0 is given by:\n\nxx\u2080 + yy\u2080 + D*(x + x\u2080)/2 + E*(y + y\u2080)/2 + F =0.\n\nWait, maybe better to recall the formula for tangent line at point (x\u2081,y\u2081) on the circle.\n\nAlternatively, for the circle with center (h,k) and radius r, the tangent at (x\u2081,y\u2081) is (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2? Wait, no, actually, the tangent line equation is:\n\n(x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2?\n\nNo, that's the equation of the circle. Wait, the tangent line at (x\u2081,y\u2081) on the circle (x - h)^2 + (y -k)^2 = r\u00b2 is:\n\n(x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y -k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, actually, no. The standard tangent line formula is:\n\nFor circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r\u00b2, the tangent at (x\u2081, y\u2081) is (x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, but actually, if (x\u2081, y\u2081) is on the circle, then (x\u2081 - h)^2 + (y\u2081 - k)^2 = r\u00b2, so expanding the tangent equation:\n\n(x\u2081 - h)(x - h) + (y\u2081 - k)(y - k) = (x\u2081 - h)^2 + (y\u2081 - k)^2 = r\u00b2, so that's correct. So that is the tangent line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe better to compute the center of the circle first.\n\nGiven the equation we found earlier: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nLet me rewrite this in standard form by completing the squares.\n\nx\u00b2 -9x + y\u00b2 - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nComplete the square for x terms:\n\nx\u00b2 -9x = x\u00b2 -9x + (81/4) - 81/4 = (x - 9/2)^2 - 81/4.\n\nSimilarly, for y terms:\n\ny\u00b2 - (33\u221a14)/28 y. Let me factor out the coefficient of y\u00b2, which is 1. The coefficient of y is - (33\u221a14)/28. Half of that is - (33\u221a14)/56, square is (33\u221a14 /56)^2. So:\n\ny\u00b2 - (33\u221a14)/28 y = [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 - ( (33\u221a14)/56 )^2.\n\nTherefore, putting it all together:\n\n(x - 9/2)^2 -81/4 + [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 - ( (33\u221a14)/56 )^2 =0.\n\nThus,\n\n(x - 9/2)^2 + [y - (33\u221a14)/56]^2 = 81/4 + ( (33\u221a14)/56 )^2.\n\nHmm, this is getting quite messy. Maybe this approach is not the most efficient. Let me see if there's another way.\n\nAlternatively, since D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, perhaps the polar of D with respect to the circle is the line BC? Wait, no. The polar of D would be the line joining the points of contact of the tangents from D, which are B and C. Therefore, the polar of D is line BC. Therefore, point D lies on the polar of BC? Wait, maybe not. Wait, the polar of point D is line BC, so if we want coordinates of D, perhaps we can use pole and polar concepts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center of the circle. Similarly for tangent at C.\n\nIf I can compute the center O, then I can find the equations of the tangents.\n\nAlternatively, given that the coordinates are getting complicated, maybe using barycentric coordinates or other methods?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using the fact that in triangle ABC, the intersection of the tangents at B and C is the exsymmedian point or something?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of using coordinates again but perhaps compute the tangent lines step by step.\n\nGiven that point B is (9,0), and the tangent at B to the circumcircle.\n\nWe need the slope of the tangent at B. Since the tangent is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center of the circle.\n\nSo if I can compute the center O, then I can find the slope of OB, then take the negative reciprocal for the tangent slope.\n\nWait, perhaps that's the way to go. Let me compute the center O first.\n\nEarlier, we had the equation of the circle as x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nThe center (h,k) is given by ( -D/2, -E/2 ). From the general equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, so here D = -9, E = - (33\u221a14)/28.\n\nThus, center coordinates:\n\nh = -D/2 = 9/2,\n\nk = -E/2 = (33\u221a14)/56.\n\nTherefore, center O is at (9/2, 33\u221a14 /56 ).\n\nHmm, okay. So the center is at (4.5, (33\u221a14)/56). That's still a bit messy, but let's proceed.\n\nNow, the tangent at point B (9,0). The radius OB is the line from O to B. Let me compute the slope of OB.\n\nCoordinates of O: (9/2, 33\u221a14/56 )\n\nCoordinates of B: (9,0).\n\nSo the vector from O to B is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14/56 ) = (9/2, -33\u221a14/56 )\n\nThus, the slope of OB is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) / (9/2 ) = ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) * (2/9 ) = ( -66\u221a14 ) / (504 ) = simplify numerator and denominator by 6: -11\u221a14 /84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the radius OB is -11\u221a14 /84. Therefore, the slope of the tangent line at B, which is perpendicular, is the negative reciprocal: (84)/(11\u221a14).\n\nSimplify that: 84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) ) = (6\u221a14)/11. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, reciprocal of slope is 84/(11\u221a14), but slope of tangent is positive reciprocal? Wait, the slope of OB is m = -11\u221a14 /84, so the tangent slope is perpendicular, so m_tangent = -1/m_OB = 84/(11\u221a14). Yes, that's correct. So the tangent at B has slope 84/(11\u221a14).\n\nSimilarly, let's rationalize the denominator:\n\n84/(11\u221a14) = (84\u221a14)/(11*14) = (6\u221a14)/11. Because 84 divided by 14 is 6. So slope simplifies to (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B has slope 6\u221a14 /11, and passes through point B (9,0). So equation is:\n\ny -0 = (6\u221a14 /11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, find the tangent at point C (0,0). Wait, point C is (0,0). Let me compute the tangent at C.\n\nFirst, the radius OC is from center O (9/2, 33\u221a14/56 ) to point C (0,0). The vector is (-9/2, -33\u221a14/56 ). So the slope of OC is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) / (-9/2 ) = ( -33\u221a14 /56 ) * ( -2/9 ) = (66\u221a14)/(504) = simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 6: 11\u221a14 /84. So slope of OC is 11\u221a14 /84.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is perpendicular to OC, so its slope is the negative reciprocal: -84/(11\u221a14).\n\nAgain, rationalize:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C has slope -6\u221a14 /11 and passes through point C (0,0). So equation is y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x.\n\nNow, we need to find point D, which is the intersection of the two tangent lines: the tangent at B and tangent at C.\n\nSo set the two equations equal:\n\nFrom tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14 /11)(x -9)\n\nFrom tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x\n\nSet equal:\n\n(6\u221a14 /11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14 /11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nTherefore, x -9 = -x => 2x =9 => x = 9/2.\n\nThen plug back into tangent at C equation: y = (-6\u221a14 /11)*(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/22 = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nSo point D has coordinates (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nHmm, okay. So coordinates of D are (4.5, -27\u221a14 /11).\n\nNow, we need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, let's find parametric equation of line AD.\n\nPoint A is (26/3, 4\u221a14 /3 ), point D is (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 ). Let me write these coordinates as fractions to make calculations easier.\n\nPoint A: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3 )\n\nPoint D: (9/2, (-27\u221a14)/11 )\n\nWe can parametrize line AD as follows. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1 for points from A to D, but since we need the other intersection P, which is beyond A from D's perspective, perhaps parameter t beyond 1?\n\nAlternatively, let me write parametric equations.\n\nLet me denote the direction vector from D to A:\n\n\u0394x = (26/3 - 9/2 ) = (52/6 - 27/6 ) = 25/6.\n\n\u0394y = (4\u221a14 /3 - (-27\u221a14 /11 )) = (4\u221a14 /3 + 27\u221a14 /11 ) = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11 ) = \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 ) = \u221a14*(125/33).\n\nSo the direction vector is (25/6, 125\u221a14 /33 )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps write parametric equations starting at D and going towards A, then beyond to P.\n\nLet me let parameter s such that when s=0, we are at D, and s=1 corresponds to A, and then P is at some s = k >1.\n\nSo parametric equations:\n\nx = 9/2 + (25/6)s\n\ny = (-27\u221a14)/11 + (125\u221a14 /33)s\n\nWe need to find the point P where this line intersects the circle \u03c9 again. Since A is already on both the line and the circle, P is the other intersection point.\n\nThe equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nSo substitute x and y from parametric equations into the circle equation and solve for s. Since we know s=1 is a solution (point A), we can factor that out.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet me write the parametric equations as:\n\nx = 9/2 + (25/6)s,\n\ny = (-27\u221a14)/11 + (125\u221a14 /33)s.\n\nLet me substitute into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nThis substitution will result in a quadratic equation in s, with one root at s=1. The other root will correspond to point P. Then, using Vieta's theorem, the product of the roots s1 and s2 is equal to the constant term divided by the coefficient of s\u00b2. Since one root is s=1, the other can be found accordingly.\n\nThis seems tedious but doable. Let me proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, compute x and y expressions in terms of s.\n\nLet me compute x first:\n\nx = 9/2 + (25/6)s,\n\nSimilarly,\n\ny = (-27\u221a14)/11 + (125\u221a14 /33)s.\n\nLet me compute x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = [9/2 + (25/6)s]^2 = (9/2)^2 + 2*(9/2)*(25/6)s + (25/6 s)^2\n\n= 81/4 + (450/12)s + (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, y\u00b2 = [ (-27\u221a14)/11 + (125\u221a14 /33)s ]^2\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14 from y terms:\n\ny = \u221a14 [ -27/11 + (125/33)s ]\n\nTherefore,\n\ny\u00b2 = 14*[ (-27/11 + (125/33)s ) ]^2\n\nLet me compute the square inside:\n\nLet me denote term inside as A = -27/11 + (125/33)s,\n\nso A = (-27/11) + (125/33)s = (-81/33 + 125/33)s ??? Wait no:\n\nWait, -27/11 = -81/33, and 125/33 is already over 33. So:\n\nA = (-81/33) + (125/33)s = (125s -81)/33.\n\nThus,\n\ny\u00b2 =14*( (125s -81)^2 )/(33)^2.\n\nTherefore, putting back into the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, x\u00b2:\n\n= 81/4 + (450/12)s + (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nSecond term y\u00b2:\n\n=14*( (125s -81)^2 )/(33)^2\n\nThird term: -9x = -9*(9/2 + (25/6)s ) = -81/2 - (225/6)s = -81/2 - 75/2 s\n\nFourth term: - (33\u221a14)/28 y = - (33\u221a14)/28 * [ (-27\u221a14)/11 + (125\u221a14 /33)s ]\n\nLet me compute that term:\n\nFirst, distribute the multiplication:\n\n= - (33\u221a14)/28 * (-27\u221a14)/11 + - (33\u221a14)/28 * (125\u221a14 /33)s\n\nSimplify each part:\n\nFirst part:\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 * (-27\u221a14)/11 = (33*27)/(28*11) * (\u221a14 * \u221a14 )\n\n= ( (33/11)*(27/28) ) * 14\n\nBecause \u221a14 * \u221a14 =14,\n\nSo 33/11 =3, 27/28 stays,\n\nThus, 3*(27/28)*14 = 3*27*(14/28) = 3*27*(1/2) = (81/2).\n\nSecond part:\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 * (125\u221a14 /33)s = - (125/28)*( (\u221a14)^2 ) s\n\n= - (125/28)*14 s = - (125/2)s.\n\nTherefore, the fourth term simplifies to 81/2 - (125/2)s.\n\nPutting all terms together into the equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0,\n\nSubstitute each part:\n\n[81/4 + (450/12)s + (625/36)s\u00b2 ] + [14*( (125s -81)^2 )/(33)^2 ] + [ -81/2 -75/2 s ] + [81/2 -125/2 s ] =0.\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, the fourth term was - (33\u221a14)/28 y, which simplified to 81/2 - (125/2)s. So adding all terms:\n\nFirst term (x\u00b2):\n\n81/4 + (450/12)s + (625/36)s\u00b2\n\nSecond term (y\u00b2):\n\n14*( (125s -81)^2 )/(33)^2\n\nThird term (-9x):\n\n-81/2 -75/2 s\n\nFourth term (- (33\u221a14)/28 y):\n\n81/2 -125/2 s\n\nAdding all these together equals zero.\n\nLet me combine the constants, the terms with s, and the s\u00b2 terms:\n\nConstants:\n\n81/4 + [from y\u00b2 term] + (-81/2) + 81/2.\n\nThe -81/2 and +81/2 cancel, so constants are 81/4 + [from y\u00b2 term].\n\nWait, actually the y\u00b2 term is a quadratic in s, so the constants will be part of that term. Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should compute each term step by step.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is too time-consuming. Maybe there is a smarter approach?\n\nWait, going back to the Power of a Point. Earlier, I thought DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Since we can compute DA and DB, perhaps we can use that?\n\nWait, yes! Let me recall that Power of Point D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nSo if I can compute DA and DB, then I can find DP = DB\u00b2 / DA, so AP = DP - DA? Wait, need to check the direction.\n\nWait, since D is outside the circle, and line AD passes through A and then goes to P, so the order is D---A---P. Therefore, DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, which is DA + AP. Therefore:\n\nDA * DP = DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, DA\u00b2 + DA * AP = DB\u00b2.\n\nWe can solve for AP:\n\nAP = (DB\u00b2 - DA\u00b2)/DA = (DB\u00b2 / DA ) - DA.\n\nAlternatively, AP = (DB\u00b2 - DA\u00b2)/DA.\n\nThus, if I can compute DA and DB, then AP can be found directly. This is much simpler!\n\nWow, that's a much better approach. I should have thought of this earlier. So let me compute DA and DB.\n\nFirst, compute DB. Since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, and DB is the length of the tangent from D to the circle, which is equal to DC. So DB = DC. Wait, but we can also compute it directly from coordinates.\n\nWait, but since we have coordinates for D and B, we can compute DB.\n\nPoint D is (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 )\n\nPoint B is (9, 0).\n\nCompute distance DB:\n\n\u0394x = 9 - 9/2 = 9/2,\n\n\u0394y = 0 - (-27\u221a14 /11 ) = 27\u221a14 /11.\n\nThus,\n\nDB = sqrt( (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14 /11)^2 )\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(9/2)^2 = 81/4,\n\n(27\u221a14 /11)^2 = (27^2)*(14)/(11^2) = 729*14 /121 = 10206 /121.\n\nSo,\n\nDB\u00b2 = 81/4 + 10206/121.\n\nTo add these, find a common denominator. Let me compute:\n\nConvert 81/4 to 81*121/(4*121) = (81*121)/484,\n\nand 10206/121 = (10206*4)/(484).\n\nThus,\n\nDB\u00b2 = [81*121 + 10206*4 ] / 484.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst, 81*121:\n\n81*120 = 9720, plus 81*1 =81, total 9801.\n\nThen 10206*4: 10206*2 =20412, *2 again is 40824.\n\nTotal numerator: 9801 +40824 = 50625.\n\nTherefore, DB\u00b2 = 50625 /484.\n\nThus, DB = sqrt(50625/484) = 225/22.\n\nBecause sqrt(50625)=225, sqrt(484)=22. So DB = 225/22.\n\nSimilarly, compute DA, the distance between D and A.\n\nPoint D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 )\n\nPoint A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 )\n\nCompute \u0394x and \u0394y:\n\n\u0394x = 26/3 - 9/2 = (52/6 - 27/6 ) = 25/6,\n\n\u0394y = (4\u221a14/3 ) - (-27\u221a14/11 ) = 4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11 ) = \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 ) = \u221a14*(125/33 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nDA\u00b2 = (25/6)^2 + ( \u221a14*(125/33) )\u00b2\n\nCompute each term:\n\n(25/6)^2 = 625/36,\n\n(\u221a14 *125/33)^2 =14*(125)^2/(33)^2 =14*(15625)/1089 = 218750 /1089.\n\nTherefore,\n\nDA\u00b2 = 625/36 + 218750/1089.\n\nAgain, common denominator is 36*1089 = 39204.\n\nConvert fractions:\n\n625/36 = 625*1089 /39204,\n\n218750/1089 =218750*36 /39204.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst term: 625*1089: Let's compute 625*1000=625000, 625*89=55625, total 625000+55625=680625.\n\nSecond term: 218750*36: 200000*36=7,200,000; 18,750*36=675,000. Total 7,200,000 +675,000 =7,875,000.\n\nTotal numerator: 680,625 +7,875,000 =8,555,625.\n\nTherefore DA\u00b2 =8,555,625 /39,204.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73 =2,851,875,\n\n39,204 \u00f73=13,068.\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n2,851,875 \u00f73= 950,625,\n\n13,068 \u00f73=4,356.\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73=316,875,\n\n4,356 \u00f73=1,452.\n\nDivide by 3 again:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1,452 \u00f73=484.\n\nNow 105,625 /484.\n\nCheck if they have common factors. 105,625 divided by 25 is 4,225, 484 divided by 4 is 121.\n\nWait, 105,625 = 25*4225 =25*(25*169) =25*25*13\u00b2.\n\n484 is 22\u00b2 = (2*11)^2.\n\nHmm, 105625 = 25*4225 =25*(25*169)=25*25*13\u00b2,\n\n484=4*121=4*11\u00b2.\n\nThus, no common factors except perhaps 1. Wait, 105625 and 484:\n\n105625 is divisible by 5, 484 not. So they are co-prime? Wait, 484 is 2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2, 105,625 is 5^4\u00d713\u00b2. So yes, co-prime. Thus,\n\nDA\u00b2 =105625 /484,\n\nTherefore DA = sqrt(105625/484)= 325/22. Since sqrt(105625)=325, sqrt(484)=22.\n\nSo DA = 325/22.\n\nNow, going back to the Power of a Point formula:\n\nDA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nWe have DA = 325/22,\n\nDB\u00b2 = (225/22)^2 = 50625/484,\n\nThus,\n\nDP = (DB\u00b2)/DA = (50625/484) / (325/22 ) = (50625/484)*(22/325).\n\nSimplify:\n\n50625 divided by 325: Let's see:\n\n325 \u00d7 156 = 325\u00d7150 +325\u00d76 =48,750 +1,950 =50,700. Hmm, 50625 is 50,700 -75 = 50,700 -75 =50,625.\n\nThus 50625 =325\u00d7156 -75. Not sure, perhaps better to factor numerator and denominator.\n\n50625 = 225\u00b2,\n\n325 = 25\u00d713,\n\n22 =2\u00d711,\n\n484=22\u00b2.\n\nSo,\n\n50625/484 *22/325 = (225\u00b2 / 22\u00b2 ) * (22/(25\u00d713)).\n\n= (225\u00b2 *22 ) / (22\u00b2 *25\u00d713 )\n\n= (225\u00b2 ) / (22 *25\u00d713 )\n\n= (225\u00b2)/(22\u00d7325).\n\nWait, maybe cancel 225 and 25:\n\n225 =25\u00d79,\n\nThus,\n\n225\u00b2 = (25\u00d79)^2 =25\u00b2\u00d781,\n\nSo,\n\n(25\u00b2\u00d781)/(22\u00d725\u00d713 ) = (25\u00d781)/(22\u00d713 )\n\n= (2025)/(286).\n\nWait, let me compute 2025 divided by 286.\n\n286 \u00d77 =2002,\n\n2025-2002=23,\n\nThus, 2025/286 =7 +23/286 =7 + (23/286). Hmm, but perhaps simplifying:\n\n2025 and 286: GCD?\n\n2025 \u00f75=405, 286 \u00f72=143, so no common factors. So 2025/286 is simplified.\n\nWait, but let me check the calculation again:\n\nWait, the DP expression is:\n\nDP = (50625/484)*(22/325)\n\nLet me compute numerator: 50625 *22,\n\nDenominator:484 *325,\n\n50625 *22: 50625*20=1,012,500; 50625*2=101,250 \u2192 total 1,113,750.\n\nDenominator:484 *325.\n\n484*300=145,200,\n\n484*25=12,100,\n\nTotal:145,200+12,100=157,300.\n\nThus DP =1,113,750 /157,300.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator by 10: 111,375 /15,730.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5: 22,275 /3,146.\n\nCheck if divisible by 13: 3146 \u00f713: 13\u00d7242=3146, so yes.\n\n22,275 \u00f713: 13\u00d71713=22,269, so 22,275-22,269=6. So not divisible by 13. Hmm, maybe other factors?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here.\n\nWait, 484 * 325: 484*300 is 145,200 and 484*25 is 12,100, total 157,300. Correct.\n\n50625*22=50,625*22. Wait, 50,625*20=1,012,500, plus 50,625*2=101,250 \u2192 total 1,113,750. Correct.\n\nSo DP = 1,113,750 /157,300. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 50: numerator 22,275, denominator 3,146. Then, check GCD of 22275 and 3146.\n\nDivide 3146 into 22275:\n\n3146 \u00d77=22,022,\n\n22275 -22,022 =253.\n\nThen GCD(3146,253). 3146 \u00f7253=12.44, 253\u00d712=3036, 3146-3036=110,\n\nGCD(253,110). 253 \u00f7110=2.3, 110\u00d72=220, 253-220=33,\n\nGCD(110,33)=11,\n\nThus GCD is 11. So 253=11\u00d723, 110=11\u00d710,\n\nThus GCD(22275,3146)=11?\n\nWait, let's see 22275 \u00f711: 11\u00d72025=22,275. Yes, 11\u00d72025=22,275. And 3146 \u00f711=286. So yes, GCD is 11.\n\nTherefore,\n\n22275/3146 = (22275 \u00f711)/(3146 \u00f711)=2025/286.\n\nSo DP =2025/286.\n\nTherefore, AP = DP - DA ?\n\nWait, need to confirm the direction. Since DA is from D to A, and DP is from D to P, and since P is on the extension beyond A from D, then AP = DP - DA.\n\nYes, because DP = DA + AP \u21d2 AP = DP - DA.\n\nTherefore,\n\nAP = (2025/286) - (325/22).\n\nConvert to common denominator, which is 286 (since 22\u00d713=286).\n\n325/22 = (325\u00d713)/286 = 4225/286.\n\nThus,\n\nAP =2025/286 -4225/286 = (2025 -4225)/286 = (-2200)/286.\n\nWait, that gives a negative value? That can't be. Did I do something wrong here?\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps I messed up the direction. Let me check:\n\nIf D is outside the circle, and line AD goes from D through A to P, then the length DP is DA + AP. So AP = DP - DA. But if DP is shorter than DA, then AP would be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, likely a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me recheck the Power of a Point formula. The Power of a Point D with respect to the circle is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nSo DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nSo DP = DB\u00b2 / DA,\n\nWe have DB =225/22,\n\nso DB squared is (225/22)^2 =50625/484,\n\nDA is 325/22,\n\nThus DP = (50625/484)/(325/22)= (50625/484)*(22/325)= (50625*22)/(484*325).\n\nLet me compute numerator and denominator:\n\n50625*22 = 50625*20 +50625*2 =1,012,500 +101,250 =1,113,750.\n\nDenominator:484*325. Let me compute 484*300=145,200; 484*25=12,100; total 157,300.\n\nThus, DP=1,113,750 /157,300.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 50: 22,275 /3,146,\n\nThen as before, divide numerator and denominator by GCD 11:2025/286.\n\n2025 divided by 286 is approximately 7.08,\n\n325/22\u224814.77,\n\nWait, but DP \u22487.08, which is less than DA\u224814.77. That can't be, since DP should be longer than DA because P is on the extension beyond A from D.\n\nHmm, so this suggests a miscalculation.\n\nWait a second, maybe I messed up DA's calculation?\n\nLet me re-calculate DA.\n\nDA is the distance between D (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 ) and A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 ).\n\n\u0394x =26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6,\n\n\u0394y =4\u221a14/3 - (-27\u221a14/11 ) =4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11,\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nConvert to common denominator 33:\n\n4\u221a14/3 =44\u221a14/33,\n\n27\u221a14/11 =81\u221a14/33,\n\nTotal \u0394y = (44 +81)\u221a14 /33 =125\u221a14 /33.\n\nTherefore, \u0394y squared is (125\u221a14 /33 )\u00b2 = (125\u00b2 *14)/33\u00b2 = (15625 *14)/1089 =218,750 /1089,\n\n\u0394x squared is (25/6)^2 =625/36.\n\nThus DA squared is 625/36 +218,750/1089,\n\nConvert to common denominator 39204 (which is 36\u00d71089):\n\n625/36 = (625\u00d71089)/39204,\n\n218,750/1089 = (218,750\u00d736)/39204,\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n625\u00d71089: Let's compute 600\u00d71089=653,400; 25\u00d71089=27,225 \u2192 total 653,400 +27,225 =680,625.\n\n218,750\u00d736: 200,000\u00d736=7,200,000; 18,750\u00d736=675,000 \u2192 total 7,875,000.\n\nTotal numerator:680,625 +7,875,000=8,555,625,\n\nThus DA squared =8,555,625 /39,204,\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73 =2,851,875,\n\n39,204 \u00f73=13,068,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n2,851,875 \u00f73=950,625,\n\n13,068 \u00f73=4,356,\n\nDivide by 3 again:\n\n950,625 \u00f73=316,875,\n\n4,356 \u00f73=1,452,\n\nDivide by 3 again:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1,452 \u00f73=484.\n\nThus DA squared =105,625 /484,\n\nSo DA is sqrt(105,625)/sqrt(484) = 325/22 \u224814.77.\n\nOkay that's correct.\n\nThen DP = DB squared / DA = (50,625/484)/(325/22) = (50,625/484)*(22/325).\n\nCompute numerator:50,625\u00d722=1,113,750,\n\nDenominator:484\u00d7325=157,300,\n\nThus DP=1,113,750 /157,300 \u22487.08.\n\nWait, but that would mean DP is less than DA, which contradicts the Power of a Point since D is outside, so DP must be longer than DA.\n\nHmm, so something is wrong here. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the Power of a Point formula.\n\nWait, the Power of a Point D with respect to the circle is equal to DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nBut if DP is the length from D to P, and the points are ordered D---A---P, then DP = DA + AP,\n\nThus DA*(DA + AP) = DB\u00b2,\n\nSo DA\u00b2 + DA*AP = DB\u00b2,\n\nHence AP = (DB\u00b2 - DA\u00b2)/DA,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = ( (50625/484 ) - (105625/484 )) / (325/22 )\n\nWait, wait, hold on:\n\nWait, DA squared is 105625/484,\n\nDB squared is 50625/484,\n\nSo DB squared - DA squared = (50625 -105625)/484 = (-55,000)/484,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = (negative number)/ (325/22 ) which would be negative, which is impossible.\n\nHmm, that can't be. So this suggests that my calculation is wrong, but where?\n\nWait, the Power of a Point formula states that for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nBut if the line DA passes through the circle, then the two intersections are A and P, so the Power of a Point formula is indeed DA * DP = DB\u00b2,\n\nBut if DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, then since P is further from D than A, DP must be greater than DA, so DA * DP must be greater than DA\u00b2,\n\nBut according to the numbers,\n\nDA squared is 105,625 /484 \u2248 218.6,\n\nDB squared is 50,625 /484 \u2248104.6,\n\nSo DA squared is greater than DB squared, which would mean DA * DP = DB\u00b2 implies DP = DB\u00b2 / DA \u2248104.6 /14.77\u22487.08,\n\nBut DA is 14.77, so DP is smaller than DA, which contradicts the external point.\n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the calculation of DB squared or DA squared.\n\nWait, let me re-calculate DB squared.\n\nPoint D is (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 ),\n\nPoint B is (9,0).\n\n\u0394x =9 - 9/2 =9/2,\n\n\u0394y =0 - (-27\u221a14 /11 )=27\u221a14 /11,\n\nThus,\n\nDB squared = (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14 /11 )^2,\n\n(9/2)^2 =81/4 =20.25,\n\n(27\u221a14 /11 )^2 = (27^2)*(14)/(11^2)=729*14/121,\n\n729*14: 700*14=9800, 29*14=406 \u2192 total 10,206,\n\nThus, 10,206 /121 \u224884.347,\n\nThus total DB squared is 20.25 +84.347\u2248104.597,\n\nWhich is roughly 104.6, as before.\n\nDA squared is (325/22)^2 \u2248(14.77)^2\u2248218.15,\n\nThus DA squared is indeed larger than DB squared, which contradicts the Power of a Point formula. Since Power of a Point D is DA * DP = DB squared,\n\nIf DA * DP = DB squared,\n\nBut DA is longer than DB, so DP must be less than DB,\n\nBut since D is outside, the point P should be on the extension beyond A from D, so DP must be greater than DA,\n\nThis is a contradiction, so something is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps my coordinates are wrong?\n\nWait, maybe I messed up the coordinates of point D?\n\nLet me re-calculate the coordinates of D.\n\nWe had the tangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9),\n\nand tangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x,\n\nSetting them equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14 /11)x,\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14):\n\n(x -9) = -x,\n\nThus 2x =9 \u21d2x=9/2,\n\nThen y = (-6\u221a14 /11)*(9/2) = (-27\u221a14)/11,\n\nSo that's correct. So coordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 ).\n\nHmm. Then coordinates are correct.\n\nWait, but the Power of a Point formula must hold. If DA * DP = DB squared,\n\nBut according to the values, DA\u224814.77, DB squared\u2248104.6,\n\nThus DP\u2248104.6 /14.77\u22487.08,\n\nWhich would mean that P is between D and A, but since A is on the circle, P should be the other intersection, so beyond A from D,\n\nHence DP must be greater than DA,\n\nThis is impossible, so there must be a miscalculation in coordinates or in the Power of a Point setup.\n\nWait, perhaps my direction is reversed. Maybe the Power of a Point is actually DP * DA = DB squared,\n\nBut in Power of a Point, it's the product of the entire lengths. Wait, let me recall:\n\nIf a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = power of D,\n\nHere, the line AD intersects the circle at A and P,\n\nThus DA * DP = power,\n\nBut DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P,\n\nBut if the points are D---A---P,\n\nThen DA * DP = power,\n\nBut if P is beyond A, then DP = DA + AP,\n\nHence DA*(DA + AP ) = power,\n\nThus AP = (power / DA ) - DA,\n\nBut if power < DA squared,\n\nThen AP would be negative,\n\nWhich is impossible,\n\nSo this suggests that the Power of D is negative,\n\nWait, but Power of a Point outside the circle should be positive,\n\nWait, but in our case, the Power of D is DB squared,\n\nDB is the length of the tangent from D to the circle,\n\nWhich should be positive,\n\nThus, DB squared must be equal to DA * DP,\n\nBut if DA * DP must be equal to DB squared,\n\nBut in our case DA squared > DB squared,\n\nHence DP < DA,\n\nThus the other intersection point P is between D and A,\n\nBut A is already on the circle,\n\nHence P coincides with A,\n\nBut that can't be,\n\nWait, this is a problem,\n\nHmm,\n\nWait a second, perhaps my parametrization was wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps in my coordinate system, point D is inside the circle?\n\nWait, let's check if point D is inside or outside the circle.\n\nCompute the power of D with respect to the circle:\n\nThe power is DB squared, which is equal to the power,\n\nBut also, the power can be computed as OD\u00b2 - R\u00b2,\n\nWhere O is the center,\n\nIf power is positive, then D is outside,\n\nCompute the coordinates of O:\n\nO is at (9/2, 33\u221a14 /56 ),\n\nCoordinates of D: (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 ),\n\nCompute vector OD:\n\n\u0394x =0,\n\n\u0394y = -27\u221a14 /11 -33\u221a14 /56 = \u221a14*(-27/11 -33/56 ).\n\nCompute -27/11 -33/56:\n\nCommon denominator 616 (11*56):\n\n-27/11 = -27*56 /616 = -1512 /616,\n\n-33/56 = -33*11 /616 = -363 /616,\n\nTotal: -1512 -363 = -1875 /616,\n\nThus \u0394y = \u221a14*(-1875/616),\n\nThus,\n\nOD squared = (0)^2 + (\u0394y)^2 = ( (\u221a14 * (-1875/616) )^2 ) =14*(1875/616)^2.\n\nCompute R squared: (75\u221a14 /56)^2 = (75^2 *14)/56^2 = (5625 *14)/3136 =78750/3136 \u224825.12.\n\nCompute OD squared:\n\n14*(1875/616)^2,\n\nFirst compute 1875/616 \u22483.044,\n\nSquared is \u22489.268,\n\nMultiply by 14 \u2248129.75,\n\nThus OD squared\u2248129.75,\n\nR squared\u224825.12,\n\nThus power = OD\u00b2 - R\u00b2\u2248129.75 -25.12\u2248104.63,\n\nWhich matches DB squared\u2248104.6,\n\nThus D is outside the circle,\n\nTherefore, the Power of a Point is positive,\n\nBut according to coordinates, DA * DP = DB squared,\n\nBut if DP < DA, then P is between D and A,\n\nBut since A is on the circle, then the other intersection must be on the other side,\n\nWait, perhaps my parametrization is wrong,\n\nWait, in coordinates, point A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 ) \u2248 (8.666, 4.4899),\n\nPoint D is (4.5, -27\u221a14 /11 ) \u2248(4.5, -27*3.7417/11 ) \u2248(4.5, -9.423),\n\nThus the line from D to A goes from (4.5, -9.423) to (8.666,4.4899),\n\nAnd the circle is centered at (4.5, 33\u221a14 /56 ) \u2248 (4.5, (33*3.7417)/56 )\u2248 (4.5, 2.197),\n\nSo the center is at (4.5, ~2.197). The point D is below the center, at (4.5, -9.423),\n\nSo the line DA goes from D upwards through A, which is above the center,\n\nThe circle has a radius of about sqrt(OD\u00b2 - power?) Wait, the radius squared is R\u00b2 = (75\u221a14 /56 )^2 \u224825.12,\n\nSo radius \u22485.01,\n\nThe center is at (4.5, ~2.197),\n\nPoint A is at (8.666, ~4.4899), which is distance from center:\n\nsqrt( (8.666-4.5)^2 + (4.4899 -2.197)^2 )\u2248sqrt( (4.166)^2 + (2.293)^2 )\u2248sqrt(17.36 +5.26)=sqrt(22.62)\u22484.75,\n\nWhich is less than radius 5.01? Wait, but A is supposed to be on the circle,\n\nWait, hold on, the coordinates of A were computed as (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 ). Let me verify if this lies on the circle equation.\n\nThe circle equation was x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0,\n\nPlugging in A's coordinates:\n\nx=26/3, y=4\u221a14/3,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (676/9) + (16*14)/9 = (676 + 224)/9 =900/9=100,\n\nThen -9x = -9*(26/3)= -78,\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 y = - (33\u221a14)/28*(4\u221a14/3 ) = - (33*4*14)/(28*3 ) = - (33*4*14)/(84 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n33 and 84 have a common factor of 3: 33/3=11, 84/3=28,\n\nThus, - (11*4*14)/28 = - (56*14)/28 = - (56/28)*14 = -2*14 = -28,\n\nThus total equation:\n\n100 -78 -28 = -6 \u22600.\n\nWait a second! This can't be. This means that point A is not on the circle. That's a problem. Which means I made a mistake in calculating the circle equation.\n\nWait, that's a critical mistake. The coordinates of A were computed based on the triangle sides, but when plugged into the circle equation, they don't satisfy it. That means I messed up the circle equation.\n\nLet me backtrack. When I computed the circle equation, I might have made an error.\n\nRecall that after finding the center (9/2, 33\u221a14/56 ), I should verify if point A lies on the circle.\n\nWait, perhaps my mistake was in calculating the center.\n\nLet me recalculate the center.\n\nGiven three points A(26/3,4\u221a14/3), B(9,0), C(0,0),\n\nWe can compute the circumcircle using perpendicular bisectors.\n\nFirst, find the perpendicular bisector of AB and AC.\n\nLet me compute the midpoint of AB:\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3,4\u221a14/3),\n\nCoordinates of B: (9,0).\n\nMidpoint M_AB: ( (26/3 +9)/2, (4\u221a14/3 +0)/2 )\n\nConvert 9 to 27/3,\n\n26/3 +27/3 =53/3,\n\nThus x-coordinate: (53/3)/2 =53/6 \u22488.833,\n\ny-coordinate: (4\u221a14/3)/2=2\u221a14/3 \u2248 2.993.\n\nSlope of AB:\n\n\u0394y =0 -4\u221a14/3 = -4\u221a14/3,\n\n\u0394x =9 -26/3 = (27/3 -26/3)=1/3,\n\nSlope of AB: (-4\u221a14/3)/(1/3)= -4\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the perpendicular bisector of AB has slope 1/(4\u221a14).\n\nThus, equation of perpendicular bisector of AB:\n\nUsing point M_AB (53/6, 2\u221a14/3 ),\n\ny -2\u221a14/3 = (1/(4\u221a14))(x -53/6 )\n\nSimilarly, find perpendicular bisector of AC.\n\nCoordinates of A: (26/3,4\u221a14/3),\n\nCoordinates of C: (0,0).\n\nMidpoint M_AC: (13/3, 2\u221a14/3 ).\n\nSlope of AC:\n\n\u0394y =4\u221a14/3 -0 =4\u221a14/3,\n\n\u0394x =26/3 -0 =26/3,\n\nSlope of AC: (4\u221a14/3)/(26/3)= (4\u221a14)/26= (2\u221a14)/13.\n\nPerpendicular slope is -13/(2\u221a14).\n\nEquation of perpendicular bisector of AC through M_AC (13/3, 2\u221a14/3):\n\ny -2\u221a14/3 = (-13/(2\u221a14))(x -13/3 )\n\nNow, find intersection point of the two perpendicular bisectors to get the center O.\n\nFirst, let's write both equations clearly.\n\nPerpendicular bisector of AB:\n\ny = (1/(4\u221a14))(x -53/6 ) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nPerpendicular bisector of AC:\n\ny = (-13/(2\u221a14))(x -13/3 ) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nLet me compute both equations step by step.\n\nFirst equation:\n\nLet me denote slope m1 =1/(4\u221a14),\n\nintercept term: m1*(-53/6 ) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nThus,\n\ny = [x/(4\u221a14)] - (53)/(24\u221a14) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nSecond equation:\n\nSlope m2 =-13/(2\u221a14),\n\nintercept term: m2*(-13/3 ) + 2\u221a14/3,\n\nThus,\n\ny = [-13/(2\u221a14) x] + (169)/(6\u221a14) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nNow, set the two equations equal:\n\n[x/(4\u221a14)] - (53)/(24\u221a14) + 2\u221a14/3 = [-13/(2\u221a14) x] + (169)/(6\u221a14) + 2\u221a14/3.\n\nSubtract 2\u221a14/3 from both sides:\n\n[x/(4\u221a14)] - (53)/(24\u221a14) = [-13/(2\u221a14)x] + 169/(6\u221a14).\n\nMultiply all terms by 24\u221a14 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24\u221a14*[x/(4\u221a14)] -24\u221a14*(53)/(24\u221a14) =24\u221a14*[ -13/(2\u221a14)x ] +24\u221a14*(169)/(6\u221a14).\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: 24\u221a14/(4\u221a14) x =6x,\n\nSecond term: -53,\n\nThird term:24\u221a14*(-13)/(2\u221a14)x = -24*13/2 x =-156x,\n\nFourth term:24\u221a14*(169)/(6\u221a14)=24/6 *169 =4*169=676.\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n6x -53 = -156x +676,\n\nBring variables to left and constants to right:\n\n6x +156x =676 +53,\n\n162x =729,\n\nx=729/162= 729 \u00f781=9; 162 \u00f781=2 \u2192 9/2=4.5.

No, that complicates.\n\nAlternatively, rationalize or compute numerically.\n\nAlternatively, multiply numerator and denominator:\n\nLet me compute:\n\ny = (2\u221a14)/3 -13/(12\u221a14).\n\nLet me get a common denominator of 12\u221a14:\n\nFirst term: (2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(3 *4\u221a14) = (8*14)/(12\u221a14) = 112/(12\u221a14),\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Let me think differently.\n\nLet me write both terms over denominator 12\u221a14:\n\nFirst term: -13/(12\u221a14),\n\nSecond term: (2\u221a14)/3 = (2\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(3 *4\u221a14) = (8*14)/(12\u221a14). Wait, this approach may not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, compute numerically:\n\nFirst term: -13/(12\u221a14) \u2248-13/(12*3.7417)\u2248-13/44.9\u2248-0.29,\n\nSecond term:2\u221a14/3\u22482*3.7417/3\u22487.4834/3\u22482.494,\n\nTotal y\u2248-0.29+2.494\u22482.204,\n\nWhich is approximately the center's y-coordinate we had before (33\u221a14 /56 \u2248 (33*3.7417)/56\u2248123.48 /56\u22482.205). So that matches.\n\nThus, center is indeed (9/2, 33\u221a14/56 ).\n\nBut when we plug point A into the circle equation, it didn't satisfy. Let me check again.\n\nEquation of the circle: (x - 9/2)^2 + (y - 33\u221a14/56 )^2 = R\u00b2,\n\nWhere R is the distance from center to A:\n\nCompute R squared:\n\n\u0394x =26/3 -9/2 = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6,\n\n\u0394y =4\u221a14/3 -33\u221a14/56 = \u221a14*(4/3 -33/56).\n\nCompute 4/3 -33/56:\n\nCommon denominator 168,\n\n4/3 =224/168,\n\n33/56=99/168,\n\nThus 224/168 -99/168 =125/168,\n\nThus \u0394y =\u221a14*(125/168),\n\nThus,\n\nR squared = (25/6)^2 + (125\u221a14 /168 )^2,\n\nCompute:\n\n(25/6)^2 =625/36,\n\n(125\u221a14 /168 )^2 = (125^2 *14)/(168^2)= (15625*14)/(28224)=218,750/28224\u22487.75.\n\nSo R squared\u2248625/36\u224817.36 +7.75\u224825.11,\n\nWhich matches previous calculation.\n\nNow plug point A into the circle equation:\n\n(x -9/2)^2 + (y -33\u221a14/56)^2 should equal R squared\u224825.11.\n\nCompute (x -9/2)^2:\n\nx=26/3, so 26/3 -9/2 = (52-27)/6 =25/6,\n\nSo squared is625/36\u224817.36,\n\n(y -33\u221a14/56)^2:\n\ny=4\u221a14/3,\n\nThus,\n\n4\u221a14/3 -33\u221a14/56 =\u221a14*(4/3 -33/56)=\u221a14*( (224 -99)/168 )=\u221a14*(125/168),\n\nSquared is (125\u00b2 *14)/(168\u00b2)= same as before,\n\nThus total is indeed 625/36 +218,750/28224 \u224817.36 +7.75\u224825.11,\n\nWhich matches R squared.\n\nTherefore, point A is on the circle. The previous error was in my initial circle equation computation where I had an incorrect sign for the E term.\n\nEarlier, I computed E as -33\u221a14/28, but when plugging into the general equation, the term was - (33\u221a14)/28 y,\n\nWhich would mean that the circle equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0,\n\nBut when I plugged in point A:\n\nx=26/3, y=4\u221a14/3,\n\nThe terms were:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100,\n\n-9x = -78,\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 y = - (33\u221a14)/28*(4\u221a14/3 ) = - (33*4*14)/(28*3 ) = - (33*4*14)/(84 ) = - (33*56)/84 = - (33* (56/84 )) = - (33*(2/3 )) = -22,\n\nThus total equation:\n\n100 -78 -22 =0,\n\nWhich works! I must have miscalculated before. Earlier I thought it didn't work, but actually it does.\n\nTherefore, my mistake was in the previous calculation where I incorrectly computed the term:\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 y,\n\nI must have messed up the arithmetic earlier.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates are correct.\n\nThus, returning to the Power of a Point:\n\nDA * DP = DB squared,\n\nWith DA =325/22\u224814.77,\n\nDB squared = (225/22)^2\u2248 (10.227)^2\u2248104.6,\n\nThus,\n\nDP = (DB squared)/DA \u2248104.6/14.77\u22487.08,\n\nBut since DP must be greater than DA for P to be beyond A, this is a contradiction,\n\nWait, but according to coordinates,\n\nIf the center is at (4.5, ~2.2),\n\nPoint D is at (4.5, ~-9.4),\n\nLine DA goes from D upwards to A (8.666,4.4899),\n\nBeyond A would be further away from D,\n\nSo the distance from D to P should be greater than DA,\n\nBut according to calculation, it's smaller,\n\nThus, my mistake must be in the Power of a Point formula,\n\nWait, the Power of a Point formula for external point D is:\n\nDA * DP = DB squared,\n\nBut DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P,\n\nBut if P is on the other side of the circle from D, then DP would be the distance from D to P through the circle,\n\nWait, but in the line DA, A is between D and P,\n\nThus DP is DA + AP,\n\nThus,\n\nDA*(DA + AP) = DB squared,\n\nWhich gives AP = (DB squared / DA ) - DA,\n\nWhich in this case would be:\n\nAP = (50625/484 divided by 325/22 ) - 325/22,\n\nCompute:\n\n50625/484 divided by 325/22 is (50625/484)*(22/325)=2025/286 \u22487.08,\n\nThen subtract 325/22\u224814.77,\n\nAP =7.08 -14.77\u2248-7.69,\n\nNegative, which is impossible,\n\nThus, there's a fundamental mistake in the Power of a Point application,\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is DP * DA = power,\n\nBut if the point is outside, and the line passes through the circle, then the power is equal to DA * DP,\n\nBut if the point is outside, and the line intersects the circle at two points, say A and P, with A closer to D,\n\nThen DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P,\n\nThus DA * DP = power,\n\nBut in that case, DP > DA,\n\nSo the formula holds,\n\nBut in our case,\n\nDA \u224814.77,\n\nDP\u22487.08,\n\nWhich is less than DA,\n\nThus, the formula would give a smaller power,\n\nBut according to the coordinates, the power should be DB squared\u2248104.6,\n\nDA * DP\u224814.77 *7.08\u2248104.6,\n\nWhich matches,\n\nBut geometrically, this would mean that P is between D and A,\n\nBut A is already on the circle,\n\nHence P is the same as A,\n\nBut that can't be,\n\nWait, perhaps the other intersection point is behind D?\n\nWait, the line AD starts at D, goes through A, and then exits the circle at another point P beyond A,\n\nWait, but according to the calculation, DP is shorter than DA,\n\nThis is a contradiction,\n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the coordinate calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my parametrization is inverted,\n\nWait, in the parametrization earlier,\n\nI had parametrized from D to A as s from 0 to1,\n\nThus P would be at s= k>1,\n\nThus DP = s * direction vector,\n\nBut perhaps the distance DP is not just the parameter multiplied by the length,\n\nWait, perhaps I need to re-express AP in terms of DP and DA.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my mistake was in the Power of a Point formula.\n\nWait, let me look up the Power of a Point theorem.\n\nPower of a Point outside the circle: If a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = power.\n\nIf D is outside, and the line passes through the circle, then one of the points is closer (X) and the other is farther (Y),\n\nThus DX * DY = power,\n\nIn our case, points are D---X---Y,\n\nThus DY = DX + XY,\n\nThus DX * (DX + XY ) = power,\n\nBut in our notation, if A is the closer point (X), then DA * DP = power,\n\nWith DP = DA + AP,\n\nThus DA*(DA + AP)= power,\n\nWhich gives AP = (power / DA ) - DA,\n\nBut if power < DA\u00b2,\n\nThen AP negative,\n\nWhich suggests that the other intersection point is between D and A,\n\nBut since A is on the circle, the other intersection must be on the other side,\n\nThus, perhaps the parametrization is such that P is between D and A,\n\nBut that would mean the line AD intersects the circle at A and P between D and A,\n\nHence AP is negative,\n\nBut geometrically, that's possible if the line AD enters the circle at P (closer to D) and exits at A,\n\nHence the two points are P and A,\n\nWith DP < DA,\n\nThus the Power of a Point formula holds,\n\nBut then AP would be negative,\n\nBut since we are asked for the length AP,\n\nWe can take absolute value,\n\nThus AP = | DP - DA | = DA - DP,\n\nBut then AP = DA - DP = DA - (DB squared / DA )\n\n= (DA\u00b2 - DB squared)/DA,\n\nWhich would be positive,\n\nYes, that makes sense,\n\nBecause:\n\nDA * DP = DB squared,\n\n=> DP = DB squared / DA,\n\nAP = DA - DP,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = DA - (DB squared / DA ) = (DA\u00b2 - DB squared)/DA,\n\nWhich is positive since DA\u00b2 > DB squared,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = (DA squared - DB squared)/DA,\n\nTherefore, AP = ( (105625/484 ) - (50625/484 )) / (325/22 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n105,625 -50,625 =55,000,\n\nThus numerator is 55,000 /484,\n\nDivided by (325/22 ):\n\n(55,000 /484 ) * (22/325 )\n\nSimplify:\n\n55,000 *22 =1,210,000,\n\n484 *325 =157,300,\n\nThus,\n\nAP =1,210,000 /157,300,\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100:12,100 /1,573,\n\nCheck GCD of 12100 and 1573:\n\n1573 \u00f7121=13,\n\n12100 \u00f7121=100,\n\nThus,\n\n12100 =121\u00d7100,\n\n1573=121\u00d713,\n\nThus,\n\nAP= (121\u00d7100)/(121\u00d713 ) =100/13,\n\nSo AP=100/13,\n\nThus m=100, n=13, which are coprime,\n\nHence m +n=113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\(ABC\\) inscribed in circle \\(\\omega\\), with tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) intersecting at point \\(D\\), and line \\(AD\\) intersecting \\(\\omega\\) again at \\(P\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Alright, let me start thinking.\n\nFirst, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC, D is the exsymmedian point or something? Wait, actually, the point where the two tangents meet is called the symmedian point? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Wait, actually, the intersection of the tangents at B and C is called the exsymmedian point? Or maybe it's the symmedian point? Hmm, maybe I should recall that the intersection of two tangents to a circle from a point outside is related to the symmedian. But perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then DB = DC because the lengths of tangents from a common point to a circle are equal. So, DB = DC. That's a useful piece of information.\n\nNow, since AD intersects the circumcircle again at P, so AP is a chord passing through A and P. Since P is the second intersection point, perhaps we can use power of a point, or some properties related to harmonic division, or maybe use coordinates or trigonometry?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use inversion? Hmm, but inversion might be complicated here. Alternatively, perhaps use the Power of a Point theorem. Since D is outside the circle, the power of D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. Because DA is extended to meet the circle again at P, so Power of a Point gives DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. That's a key equation.\n\nSo, if I can find DA and express DP in terms of DA, then perhaps I can solve for AP. Wait, but AP is DA - DP? Wait no, actually, since P is on AD beyond A or beyond D? Wait, AD starts at A, goes through D, and then meets the circle again at P? Wait, hold on, in the Asymptote code, they have P as the intersection of D..A with the circle. Wait, the Asymptote code says: P = IP(D..A, A..B..C); So that would be the intersection of line DA with the circumcircle again, so starting at D going towards A, so P is on the extension beyond A? Wait, but if D is outside the circle, then the line AD would pass through A and go to D, but since D is outside, the other intersection with the circle would be on the other side of A? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, then D is outside the circle. The line AD connects A to D, which is outside. So the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then continues beyond D. But the other intersection with the circle would be on the side opposite to D relative to A? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the line AD starts at A, goes through D (outside the circle), so the other intersection point P must be between A and D? Wait, but since D is outside, the line AD passes through A, exits the circle at some point P, then goes to D. Wait, but the circle is the circumcircle, so A is already on the circle. Therefore, AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), so the other intersection point P is actually the same as A? No, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, A is on the circle, so the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and the other intersection with the circle must be on the other side of A from D. Wait, but since D is outside, maybe P is between A and D? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the Asymptote code is key here. The code says: P = IP(D..A, A..B..C); So IP (intersection point) between the line DA and the circumcircle. Since A is on the circumcircle, then the other intersection is P. So P is the second point where line AD meets the circumcircle. So starting from D, going towards A, passing through A (which is on the circle), and then P must be the other intersection point, which would be on the opposite side of A from D. Wait, but that would mean P is on the extension of DA beyond A. So AP would be from A to P, which is beyond A, so AP is longer than AD? Wait, but in that case, the Power of a Point formula would be DB\u00b2 = DA * DP, where DP is the entire length from D to P, so DP = DA + AP? Wait, maybe I need to get this straight.\n\nLet me denote the points. Let me suppose that the line AD goes from A through D to P, but since D is outside, then actually the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then P is the other intersection with the circle. Wait, but since A is already on the circle, the other intersection would be on the other side of A from D. So, the points are arranged as A --- P ---- D, so that AP is from A to P, and PD is from P to D. Therefore, the entire length DP is equal to DA + AP? Wait, no. Wait, if the order is A---P---D, then DA is from D to A, which would be DP - AP? Hmm, maybe I need to use directed lengths here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use algebra.\n\nLet me think in terms of Power of a Point. The Power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 (since DB is tangent) and also DC\u00b2 (since DC is tangent). So Power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. Here, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. Since P is on line AD, then DP = DA + AP if P is beyond A from D, or DP = DA - AP if P is between D and A. Wait, but since A is on the circle and D is outside, the line AD must pass through A and then exit the circle again at P. Wait, but since A is already on the circle, the other intersection P is on the other side of A from D. So that would mean that between D and A is the segment DA, and beyond A is P. Therefore, the points are arranged as D----A----P, so DP = DA + AP. Therefore, Power of a Point gives DB\u00b2 = DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP). So that equation is DB\u00b2 = DA\u00b2 + DA*AP.\n\nHmm, okay. So if I can find DA and DB, then I can solve for AP. Alternatively, maybe express AP in terms of DA and DB. But I don't know DA or DB yet. Hmm. So perhaps I need another relation. Maybe using triangle sides and some trigonometric relations?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates? Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in coordinate plane to compute coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, use barycentric coordinates? Hmm, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, use the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC to find angles, then find coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, use inversion? Maybe inversion with respect to the circumcircle? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that in triangle ABC, the point D is the exsymmedian or something related to symmedian? Wait, the symmedian point is the intersection of the symmedians, but D is the intersection of tangents at B and C. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the pole of side BC with respect to the circumcircle? Wait, the pole of BC would be the point where the tangents at B and C meet, yes. So D is the pole of BC. Hmm, perhaps using pole and polar concepts here?\n\nAlternatively, use harmonic division? If AD is a line through A and D, which is the pole of BC, then perhaps there is a harmonic bundle here. Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, use trigonometric approach. Let me think. Let me denote some variables.\n\nLet me first compute the circumradius of triangle ABC, since we know the sides. Maybe that can help. The sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me label the triangle with vertices: Let me call the triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me check if it's a valid triangle: 5 + 9 >10, 5+10>9, 9+10>5. Yes, valid.\n\nFirst, compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a b c)/(4 area). Let me compute the area first. Using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (5+9+10)/2 = (24)/2 =12.\n\nArea = sqrt(s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)) = sqrt(12*(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)) = sqrt(12*7*3*2) = sqrt(12*7*6) = sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) Wait, actually, 12*7*3*2 = 12*42 = 504. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) no, better factor as 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, let's factor 504: 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but better to factor into primes: 504 = 8*63 = 8*7*9 = 8*7*3^2. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*7*9) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Therefore area is 6\u221a14. Then R = (a b c)/(4 area) = (5*9*10)/(4*6\u221a14) = (450)/(24\u221a14) = (75)/(4\u221a14). Rationalizing the denominator: (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56. Hmm, so R = 75\u221a14 / 56. Not sure if this is helpful yet, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, coordinates. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B along the x-axis at (9,0), but wait, but AC is 10, AB is 5. Wait, let me think. Let me set coordinates so that it's easier. Let me set point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0). Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me find coordinates of A such that AC=10 and AB=5. Let coordinates of A be (x,y). Then AC distance from (0,0) to (x,y) is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100. The distance from A to B (which is at (9,0)) is sqrt((x-9)^2 + y\u00b2) =5, so (x-9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25. Subtract the two equations: (x-9)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 -100 \u21d2 x\u00b2 - 18x +81 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -75 \u21d2 -18x +81 = -75 \u21d2 -18x = -156 \u21d2 x=156/18=26/3\u22488.666...\n\nThen x=26/3. Then y\u00b2=100 -x\u00b2=100 - (676/9)= (900 -676)/9=224/9 \u21d2 y=\u00b1\u221a(224/9)=\u00b1(\u221a224)/3=\u00b1(4\u221a14)/3. Since triangle is drawn with Asymptote code having point B at (7.8,4.4899)... Hmm, maybe they placed point A at (10,0). Wait in the Asymptote code:\n\nThe Asymptote code says:\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, P, O;\n\nC = origin; A = (10,0); B = (7.8, 4.4899);\n\nSo in their diagram, C is at (0,0), A is at (10,0), and B is at approximately (7.8,4.4899). So maybe that's the coordinate system. Let me use that. Let me set coordinates accordingly.\n\nLet me set coordinate system with C at (0,0), A at (10,0). Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute coordinates of B. Given that AC=10 (distance from (10,0) to (0,0)), BC=9, AB=5. So coordinates of B must satisfy:\n\nDistance from B to C (0,0) is 9, so sqrt(x_B\u00b2 + y_B\u00b2)=9,\n\nDistance from B to A (10,0) is 5, so sqrt( (x_B -10)^2 + y_B\u00b2 )=5,\n\nAnd distance from B to A is 5, so:\n\n(x_B -10)^2 + y_B\u00b2 =25,\n\nand x_B\u00b2 + y_B\u00b2 =81.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(x_B -10)^2 + y_B\u00b2 - (x_B\u00b2 + y_B\u00b2)=25 -81 \u21d2 x_B\u00b2 -20x_B +100 + y_B\u00b2 -x_B\u00b2 - y_B\u00b2 = -56 \u21d2 -20x_B +100 = -56 \u21d2 -20x_B = -156 \u21d2 x_B = 156/20 = 39/5 =7.8, which matches the Asymptote code. Then y_B\u00b2 =81 - (39/5)^2 =81 - (1521/25)= (2025 -1521)/25=504/25 \u21d2 y_B= sqrt(504)/5= (sqrt(14*36))/5= (6\u221a14)/5\u22486*3.7417/5\u224822.45/5\u22484.49, which matches the Asymptote's 4.4899. So coordinates:\n\nC=(0,0), A=(10,0), B=(39/5, (6\u221a14)/5). Let me note that as fractions for precision.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nLet me write coordinates precisely:\n\nLet me denote B as (39/5, (6\u221a14)/5). So that's (7.8, 6\u221a14/5). Let me confirm:\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 = (1521/25) + (36*14)/25 = (1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 =81, which is 9\u00b2. Good.\n\nSimilarly, distance from B to A:\n\n(39/5 -10)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 = (-11/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 = (121/25)+(36*14)/25 = (121 + 504)/25 = 625/25=25, which is 5\u00b2. Good.\n\nOkay, so coordinates are set. Now, need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. Since points A(10,0), B(39/5,6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0) are on the circle. Let me compute the equation of the circle.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0. Since point C (0,0) is on the circle, plugging in gives 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 \u21d2 F=0. So equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nNow plug in point A (10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 +0 +10D +0 =0 \u21d2 100 +10D =0 \u21d2 D = -10.\n\nThen plug in point B (39/5,6\u221a14/5):\n\n( (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 ) + D*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5)=0.\n\nWe know D = -10, so:\n\nFirst compute (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2:\n\n(1521/25) + (36*14)/25 = (1521 + 504)/25 =2025/25 =81, as before.\n\nSo equation becomes 81 + (-10)*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5)=0.\n\nCompute -10*(39/5)= -78.\n\nSo 81 -78 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 3 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 (6\u221a14/5) E = -3 \u21d2 E = (-3)*(5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28. Wait, but let me check:\n\nWait, E = (-5)/(2\u221a14). To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\nE = (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28. So that's E.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)*28 y? Wait, no, let me write the equation again.\n\nWait, the equation was x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0, with D=-10 and E= -5/(2\u221a14). Wait, actually, no. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, we had:\n\nAfter plugging in point B:\n\nThe equation is:\n\n81 + (-10)*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nWait, 81 - 78 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 3 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 E = (-3)*(5)/(6\u221a14) = -15/(6\u221a14) = -5/(2\u221a14). So yes, E = -5/(2\u221a14). So the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + (-5/(2\u221a14)) y =0. Hmm, this might be a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to write in standard form by completing the squares.\n\nStarting with x\u00b2 -10x + y\u00b2 + (-5/(2\u221a14)) y =0.\n\nCompleting the square for x:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x = (x -5)^2 -25.\n\nFor y terms:\n\ny\u00b2 - (5/(2\u221a14)) y = [y - (5/(4\u221a14))]^2 - (25)/(16*14). Wait, let me compute:\n\nLet me denote the coefficient of y as - (5/(2\u221a14)), so half of that is -5/(4\u221a14), square is 25/(16*14). Therefore:\n\ny\u00b2 - (5/(2\u221a14)) y = [y - 5/(4\u221a14)]\u00b2 - 25/(16*14).\n\nTherefore the entire equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 -25 + [y -5/(4\u221a14)]\u00b2 -25/(16*14) =0\n\nSo,\n\n(x -5)^2 + [y -5/(4\u221a14)]\u00b2 = 25 + 25/(16*14)\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\n25 is 25*(16*14)/(16*14) = (25*224)/224.\n\n25/(16*14) =25/224.\n\nSo total is (25*224 +25)/224 =25*(224 +1)/224 =25*225/224 = (25*225)/224. Therefore the radius squared is (25*225)/224. Hmm, complicated. Maybe not the best path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of computing the equation of the circle, compute the tangent lines at B and C, then find their intersection D.\n\nThe tangent at point C (0,0). The tangent at C to the circle. The general formula for the tangent at point (x0,y0) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F=0 is xx0 + yy0 + D(x + x0)/2 + E(y + y0)/2 + F=0. Wait, maybe better to recall that the tangent line at point P on a circle with center (h,k) is (x_P - h)(x - h) + (y_P - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? Wait, no, the standard tangent line formula is (x1)(x) + (y1)(y) + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0, but perhaps I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the tangent at point C (0,0). The tangent line at C can be found using the fact that the radius is perpendicular to the tangent. The center of the circle is (5, k), since from the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0, the center is at (D/2, E/2) with signs adjusted. Wait, the general form is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, so center is (-D/2, -E/2). So here, D = -10, E = -5/(2\u221a14). Wait, so center is at (-(-10)/2, - ( -5/(2\u221a14) ) /2 )? Wait, hold on. Wait the formula is center at (-D/2, -E/2). So D is coefficient of x, which is -10, so -D/2 = 5. The E term is coefficient of y, which is -5/(2\u221a14). Wait, actually, in the equation, the coefficient E is multiplied by y, so in the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0, so center is (-D/2, -E/2). So here, D is -10, so -D/2 =5, and E is (-5/(2\u221a14)), so -E/2 = (5/(2\u221a14))/2 =5/(4\u221a14). Therefore center is at (5, 5/(4\u221a14)). Hmm, complicated coordinates. Let me note that as O=(5, 5/(4\u221a14)).\n\nTherefore, the tangent at point C (0,0) is perpendicular to the radius OC. The radius OC is from center (5,5/(4\u221a14)) to point C (0,0). The direction vector of OC is (-5, -5/(4\u221a14)). Therefore, the tangent line at C is perpendicular to this. So the slope of OC is (\u0394y/\u0394x)= [5/(4\u221a14) -0]/[5 -0] = [5/(4\u221a14)] /5 =1/(4\u221a14). Therefore the slope of the tangent line is the negative reciprocal, which is -4\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is a line passing through C(0,0) with slope -4\u221a14. So its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, compute the tangent at B. Let me compute the tangent at point B (39/5,6\u221a14/5). The radius OB goes from center O(5,5/(4\u221a14)) to B(39/5,6\u221a14/5). Let me compute the direction vector of OB:\n\n\u0394x = 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5,\n\n\u0394y = (6\u221a14/5 - 5/(4\u221a14)).\n\nHmm, this is getting messy. Let me compute \u0394y:\n\nFirst, express both terms with a common denominator. Let me compute 6\u221a14/5 and 5/(4\u221a14):\n\nLet me write 5/(4\u221a14) as (5\u221a14)/(4*14) = (5\u221a14)/56. Wait, but maybe better to just compute numerically?\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the slope of OB.\n\nSlope of OB is [ (6\u221a14/5 - 5/(4\u221a14)) ] / (14/5).\n\nThis is going to be a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps compute the equation of the tangent at B using point-form.\n\nThe tangent at point (x1,y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F=0 is xx1 + yy1 + D(x + x1)/2 + E(y + y1)/2 + F =0. Wait, let me confirm the formula for tangent line.\n\nAlternatively, the equation of the tangent line at point P(x1,y1) on the circle with center (h,k) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? No, that's not right. Wait, the standard tangent line equation for a circle with center (h,k) at point (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? No, actually, it's (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2 only if (x1,y1) is on the circle, but that's equivalent to the equation of the circle. Wait, no.\n\nActually, the correct equation is:\n\nThe tangent line at point (x1,y1) on the circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r\u00b2 is:\n\n(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, but since (x1,y1) is on the circle, (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2 = r\u00b2, so the left side when x=x1 and y=y1 gives r\u00b2 = r\u00b2, so that works. Wait, but actually, the standard tangent line equation is:\n\n(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2. Wait, but that's actually the equation of the polar line, but perhaps for the tangent, since (x1,y1) is on the circle, it is indeed the tangent.\n\nAlternatively, the equation can be written as:\n\n(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2. Hmm, but this seems to be the same as the equation of the circle, so maybe not. Wait, actually, expanding that equation:\n\n(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2,\n\nExpanding:\n\n(x1 x - x1 h - h x + h\u00b2) + (y1 y - y1 k - k y + k\u00b2) = r\u00b2,\n\nGroup terms:\n\nx1 x + y1 y - h(x1 + x) - k(y1 + y) + h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2,\n\nBut since (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2 = r\u00b2,\n\nSo h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + 2 h x1 - x1\u00b2 + 2 k y1 - y1\u00b2,\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try with coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since I know the center O(5,5/(4\u221a14)), the tangent at point B is perpendicular to the radius OB. So, the slope of OB is (yB - yO)/(xB - xO). Let me compute that.\n\nCoordinates of O: (5, 5/(4\u221a14)),\n\nCoordinates of B: (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute \u0394x = 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5,\n\n\u0394y = (6\u221a14/5 -5/(4\u221a14)).\n\nLet me compute \u0394y:\n\nFirst term: 6\u221a14/5,\n\nSecond term: 5/(4\u221a14). Let me rationalize the denominator:\n\n5/(4\u221a14) = (5\u221a14)/(4*14) = (5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo \u0394y = (6\u221a14)/5 - (5\u221a14)/56 = \u221a14*(6/5 -5/56).\n\nCompute 6/5 -5/56: common denominator 280,\n\n6/5 = 336/280,\n\n5/56 =25/280,\n\nSo 336/280 -25/280 =311/280,\n\nThus \u0394y = \u221a14*(311/280).\n\nTherefore, the slope of OB is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = [\u221a14*(311/280)] / (14/5) = [\u221a14 *311 /280 ] * [5/14] = \u221a14 *311*5 / (280*14).\n\nSimplify denominators:\n\n280*14 = 3920,\n\nNumerator: 311*5\u221a14 =1555\u221a14,\n\nThus slope of OB is (1555\u221a14)/3920. Hmm, this is getting very messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is negative reciprocal of the slope of OB.\n\nBut this is going to be complicated. Maybe I can parametrize the tangent line equations using point-slope form once I have the slope.\n\nAlternatively, since this is getting too algebraically intensive, maybe use parametric equations or vector approaches?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that the tangent at C is y = -4\u221a14 x as previously found. Let me confirm that.\n\nEarlier, for the tangent at C (0,0): the center is (5,5/(4\u221a14)), so the radius vector is from center to C is (-5, -5/(4\u221a14)). Therefore the tangent line is perpendicular to this vector. The direction vector of the tangent line should be perpendicular to (-5, -5/(4\u221a14)), so direction vector (a,b) must satisfy -5a - (5/(4\u221a14))b =0 \u21d2 5a = - (5/(4\u221a14))b \u21d2 a = - (1/(4\u221a14)) b. So a direction vector could be ( -1/(4\u221a14), 1 ). So the tangent line at C has direction ( -1/(4\u221a14),1 ). Since it passes through (0,0), the equation can be parametrized as t*(-1/(4\u221a14),1). But slope would be rise over run: 1 / (-1/(4\u221a14)) = -4\u221a14, so yes, the slope is indeed -4\u221a14. So the tangent at C is y = -4\u221a14 x. Good.\n\nNow, need the tangent at B. Let me try to find its equation.\n\nLet me denote point B as (x_B, y_B) = (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). The tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB. The slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O). Let me compute y_O =5/(4\u221a14), x_O=5.\n\nSo slope of OB:\n\n(y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = (6\u221a14/5 -5/(4\u221a14)) / (39/5 -5).\n\nCompute denominator first: 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.\n\nNumerator:\n\n6\u221a14/5 -5/(4\u221a14). Let me write both terms over a common denominator, which would be 20\u221a14:\n\nFirst term: 6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(5*4\u221a14) Hmm, perhaps better to convert to have same denominators:\n\nLet me write 6\u221a14/5 as (6\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(5*4\u221a14) no, perhaps compute numerically?\n\nWait, let me rationalize the second term:\n\n5/(4\u221a14) = (5\u221a14)/(4*14) = (5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo the numerator becomes 6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14*(6/5 -5/56).\n\nCompute 6/5 -5/56:\n\nConvert to 280 denominator:\n\n6/5 = 336/280,\n\n5/56 =25/280,\n\nSo 336/280 -25/280 = 311/280.\n\nTherefore numerator is \u221a14*(311/280).\n\nThus slope of OB is [\u221a14*(311/280)] / (14/5) = [\u221a14 *311/280] / (14/5) = [\u221a14 *311/280] * [5/14] = [\u221a14 *311 *5 ] / (280*14).\n\nSimplify denominator: 280*14 = 3920,\n\nNumerator: 311*5\u221a14 =1555\u221a14,\n\nSo slope of OB is (1555\u221a14)/3920. Let me simplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n1555 \u00f75 =311, 3920 \u00f75=784,\n\nSo slope is (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent line at B is the negative reciprocal of that, so:\n\nm_tangent = - (784)/(311\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\nm_tangent = - (784\u221a14)/(311*14) = - (784/14)*(\u221a14)/311 = -56*(\u221a14)/311.\n\nThus, the slope of the tangent at B is -56\u221a14/311.\n\nTherefore, the tangent line at B has slope m = -56\u221a14/311 and passes through point B (39/5,6\u221a14/5). So its equation is:\n\ny -6\u221a14/5 = m (x -39/5).\n\nNow, we have the two tangent lines:\n\n1. Tangent at C: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. Tangent at B: y = [ -56\u221a14/311 ](x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nLet me set the two equations equal:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = [ -56\u221a14/311 ](x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14 from all terms:\n\n\u221a14 [ -4x ] = \u221a14 [ -56/311 (x -39/5) +6/5 ]\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a14 (since \u221a14 \u22600):\n\n-4x = -56/311 (x - 39/5) +6/5.\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nLet me write the equation:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x - 39/5) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply all terms by 311*5 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311*5 = -56*5(x -39/5) +6*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -4*5*311 x = -6220x.\n\nRight side:\n\nFirst term: -56*5(x -39/5) = -280(x) + 280*(39/5) = -280x + (280*39)/5 = -280x + 56*39 = -280x + 2184.\n\nSecond term: 6*311 =1866.\n\nSo total right side: (-280x +2184) +1866 = -280x + (2184 +1866)= -280x +4050.\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n-6220x = -280x +4050.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-6220x +280x -4050 =0 \u21d2 -5940x -4050 =0 \u21d2 -5940x =4050 \u21d2 x= -4050/5940.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 90: 4050 \u00f790=45, 5940 \u00f790=66.\n\nThus x= -45/66 = -15/22.\n\nWait, that's negative? But in the Asymptote code, point D was drawn at some coordinate, but maybe in our coordinate system it's at x negative?\n\nWait, let's check the calculations again, because getting x negative might be okay, but let me verify step by step.\n\nStarting from:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311*5:\n\nLeft side: -4x *311*5 = -6220x.\n\nRight side first term: (-56/311)(x -39/5)*311*5 = -56*5*(x -39/5) = -280*(x -39/5) = -280x + (280*39)/5 = -280x + (280/5)*39 = -280x +56*39 = -280x +2184.\n\nSecond term: 6/5 *311*5=6*311=1866.\n\nThus total right side: -280x +2184 +1866 = -280x +4050. Correct.\n\nSo equation: -6220x = -280x +4050 \u21d2 -6220x +280x =4050 \u21d2 -5940x=4050 \u21d2 x= -4050/5940.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: -405/594.\n\nDivide by 9: -45/66, then divide by 3: -15/22. So x= -15/22 \u2248-0.6818.\n\nHmm, so x-coordinate is negative. That might be okay since in the Asymptote code, point D was at (IP(B..E + (B-E)*4, C..F + (C-F)*-3)), which might place it in a different quadrant. Anyway, proceeding.\n\nNow, substitute x= -15/22 into tangent at C's equation to find y:\n\ny= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are ( -15/22, 30\u221a14/11 ).\n\nNow, need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, let's find the parametric equation of line AD. Points A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). Let me compute the direction vector from A to D:\n\n\u0394x = -15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = -235/22,\n\n\u0394y = 30\u221a14/11 -0 =30\u221a14/11.\n\nThus parametric equations for line AD can be written as:\n\nx =10 + t*(-235/22),\n\ny =0 + t*(30\u221a14/11),\n\nwhere t=0 gives A, t=1 gives D, and we need to find the other intersection point P, which would correspond to some t \u22600,1.\n\nWe need to find t such that (x(t), y(t)) lies on the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0, where E was found earlier as -5/(2\u221a14).\n\nWait, let me recall the equation. The equation was x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0 with E = -5/(2\u221a14). So substituting coordinates into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5/(2\u221a14)) y =0.\n\nPlugging in x(t) and y(t):\n\n[ (10 - (235/22)t )\u00b2 + ( (30\u221a14/11)t )\u00b2 ] -10*(10 - (235/22)t ) - (5/(2\u221a14))*(30\u221a14/11 t ) =0.\n\nThis looks quite involved, but let's compute term by term.\n\nFirst, expand (x(t))\u00b2:\n\nx(t) =10 - (235/22)t,\n\nso x(t)^2 = [10 - (235/22)t]^2 =100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t\u00b2 =100 - (4700/22)t + (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) t\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, y(t)^2 = (30\u221a14/11 t)^2 = (900*14)/121 t\u00b2 = (12600)/121 t\u00b2.\n\nNext term: -10x(t) = -10*(10 - (235/22)t )= -100 + (2350/22)t.\n\nNext term: - (5/(2\u221a14))*(30\u221a14/11 t ) = - (5*30\u221a14)/(2\u221a14*11) t = - (150)/(22) t = - (75/11) t.\n\nPutting all terms together:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5/(2\u221a14)) y =\n\n[100 - (4700/22)t + (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) t\u00b2 + 12600/121 t\u00b2] +\n\n[-100 + (2350/22)t] +\n\n[-75/11 t] =0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst group (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2):\n\n100 - (4700/22)t + [ (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) + 12600/121 ] t\u00b2.\n\nSecond group (-10x):\n\n-100 + (2350/22)t.\n\nThird group (- (5/(2\u221a14)) y):\n\n-75/11 t.\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n100 - (4700/22)t + [ (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) + 12600/121 ] t\u00b2 -100 + (2350/22)t - (75/11)t =0.\n\nSimplify constants: 100 -100 =0.\n\nCombine the terms with t:\n\n[ -4700/22 +2350/22 -75/11 ] t.\n\nConvert -75/11 to -150/22 to have common denominator:\n\n-4700/22 +2350/22 -150/22 = (-4700 +2350 -150)/22 = (-4700 +2200)/22 = (-2500)/22.\n\nThe t\u00b2 term:\n\n[ (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) +12600/121 ] t\u00b2. Note that 121 is 11\u00b2, and 22\u00b2 is 484.\n\nLet me compute 235\u00b2: 235*235. 200\u00b2=40000, 35\u00b2=1225, 2*200*35=14000, so (200+35)^2=200\u00b2 +2*200*35 +35\u00b2=40000+14000+1225=55225. So 235\u00b2=55225.\n\nThus,\n\n55225/(22\u00b2) +12600/121 = 55225/484 +12600/121.\n\nConvert to common denominator 484:\n\n12600/121 = (12600*4)/484 =50400/484.\n\nThus total t\u00b2 term:\n\n(55225 +50400)/484 =105625/484.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n(105625/484) t\u00b2 - (2500/22) t =0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt [ (105625/484) t -2500/22 ] =0.\n\nSolutions are t=0 (point A) and t= (2500/22)/(105625/484).\n\nCompute the second solution:\n\nt = (2500/22) * (484/105625).\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\nFirst, 484 /22 =22, so 2500/22 *484/105625 =2500*(484)/(22*105625).\n\n484 divided by 22 is 22, so:\n\n2500 *22 /105625.\n\n2500 divided by 25 is 100, 105625 divided by25 is 4225.\n\nWait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator:\n\n2500 = 25*100,\n\n4225=25*169,\n\nWait, 105625 \u00f725=4225. 4225 is 65\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\n2500*22 /105625 = (25*100 *22)/(25*4225) )= (100*22)/4225 = 2200/4225.\n\nSimplify 2200/4225: divide numerator and denominator by 25: 88/169.\n\nWait, 2200 \u00f725=88, 4225 \u00f725=169.\n\nThus t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, the parameter t for point P is 88/169.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of P are:\n\nx =10 + (88/169)*(-235/22),\n\ny =0 + (88/169)*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nLet me compute x first:\n\nFirst, simplify (88/169)*(-235/22):\n\n88 and 22 can be simplified: 88/22=4, so:\n\n4*(-235)/169 = (-940)/169.\n\nThus x=10 -940/169.\n\nConvert 10 to 1690/169,\n\nSo x= (1690 -940)/169 =750/169.\n\nSimilarly, y-coordinate:\n\n(88/169)*(30\u221a14/11)= (8*30\u221a14)/(169*1) because 88/11=8,\n\nSo 240\u221a14 /169.\n\nThus coordinates of P are (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nNow, need to compute the distance AP. Since point A is at (10,0), and P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nCompute AP using distance formula:\n\nAP = sqrt[ ( (750/169 -10)^2 + (240\u221a14/169 -0)^2 ) ].\n\nFirst compute 750/169 -10 =750/169 -1690/169 = (750 -1690)/169 = (-940)/169.\n\nThus,\n\nAP = sqrt[ ( (-940/169)^2 + (240\u221a14/169)^2 ) ]\n\nFactor out (1/169)^2:\n\nsqrt[ (1/169\u00b2)(940\u00b2 + (240\u00b2)(14) ) ] = (1/169) sqrt(940\u00b2 +240\u00b2*14).\n\nCompute inside the sqrt:\n\nFirst compute 940\u00b2:\n\n940\u00b2: 900\u00b2=810000, 40\u00b2=1600, 2*900*40=72000, so (900+40)^2= 810000 +72000 +1600= 883600.\n\n240\u00b2=57600,\n\n240\u00b2*14=57600*14=806,400.\n\nThus total inside sqrt:\n\n883,600 +806,400 =1,690,000.\n\nTherefore sqrt(1,690,000)=1300.\n\nThus AP = (1/169)*1300 =1300/169.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by13:\n\n1300 \u00f713=100,\n\n169 \u00f713=13.\n\nThus AP=100/13.\n\nCheck if 100 and13 are coprime: yes, since 13 is prime and doesn't divide 100. Therefore, m=100, n=13, so m +n=113.\n\nWait, but let me check calculations again because this seems straightforward but let me verify:\n\nFirst, the coordinates of P were (750/169, 240\u221a14/169). The difference from A (10,0):\n\n\u0394x=750/169 -10 = (750 - 1690)/169 = (-940)/169,\n\n\u0394y=240\u221a14/169 -0 =240\u221a14/169,\n\nThen squared terms:\n\n(\u0394x)^2 = (940)^2/(169)^2,\n\n(\u0394y)^2 = (240^2 *14)/(169)^2,\n\nThus sum:\n\n(940\u00b2 +240\u00b2*14)/169\u00b2,\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n940\u00b2= (900+40)^2=900\u00b2 +2*900*40 +40\u00b2=810000+72000+1600=883,600,\n\n240\u00b2*14=57,600*14=806,400,\n\nTotal numerator: 883,600 +806,400=1,690,000,\n\n\u221a(1,690,000)=1300,\n\nThus sqrt(...) is 1300/(169),\n\nSo AP=1300/169= (1300 \u00f713)/(169 \u00f713)=100/13. Correct.\n\nSo m=100, n=13, which are coprime. Thus m +n=113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects \u03c9 again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer needs to be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Alright, let me start thinking.\n\nFirst, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC, D is the exsymmedian point or something? Wait, actually, the point where the two tangents meet is called the symmedian point? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Wait, actually, the intersection of the tangents at B and C is called the exsymmedian point? Or maybe it's the symmedian point? Hmm, maybe I should recall that the intersection of two tangents to a circle from a point outside is related to the symmedian. But perhaps I need a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C, then DB = DC because the lengths of tangents from a common point to a circle are equal. So, DB = DC. That's a useful piece of information.\n\nNow, since AD intersects the circumcircle again at P, so AP is a chord passing through A and P. Since P is the second intersection point, perhaps we can use power of a point, or some properties related to harmonic division, or maybe use coordinates or trigonometry?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use inversion? Hmm, but inversion might be complicated here. Alternatively, perhaps use the Power of a Point theorem. Since D is outside the circle, the power of D with respect to \u03c9 is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. Because DA is extended to meet the circle again at P, so Power of a Point gives DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. That's a key equation.\n\nSo, if I can find DA and express DP in terms of DA, then perhaps I can solve for AP. Wait, but AP is DA - DP? Wait no, actually, since P is on AD beyond A or beyond D? Wait, AD starts at A, goes through D, and then meets the circle again at P? Wait, hold on, in the Asymptote code, they have P as the intersection of D..A with the circle. Wait, the Asymptote code says: P = IP(D..A, A..B..C); So that would be the intersection of line DA with the circumcircle again, so starting at D going towards A, so P is on the extension beyond A? Wait, but if D is outside the circle, then the line AD would pass through A and go to D, but since D is outside, the other intersection with the circle would be on the other side of A? Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.\n\nWait, if D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, then D is outside the circle. The line AD connects A to D, which is outside. So the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then continues beyond D. But the other intersection with the circle would be on the side opposite to D relative to A? Wait, no. Wait, actually, the line AD starts at A, goes through D (outside the circle), so the other intersection point P must be between A and D? Wait, but since D is outside, the line AD passes through A, exits the circle at some point P, then goes to D. Wait, but the circle is the circumcircle, so A is already on the circle. Therefore, AD starts at A (on the circle), goes through D (outside), so the other intersection point P is actually the same as A? No, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, A is on the circle, so the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and the other intersection with the circle must be on the other side of A from D. Wait, but since D is outside, maybe P is between A and D? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, perhaps the Asymptote code is key here. The code says: P = IP(D..A, A..B..C); So IP (intersection point) between the line DA and the circumcircle. Since A is on the circumcircle, then the other intersection is P. So P is the second point where line AD meets the circumcircle. So starting from D, going towards A, passing through A (which is on the circle), and then P must be the other intersection point, which would be on the opposite side of A from D. Wait, but that would mean P is on the extension of DA beyond A. So AP would be from A to P, which is beyond A, so AP is longer than AD? Wait, but in that case, the Power of a Point formula would be DB\u00b2 = DA * DP, where DP is the entire length from D to P, so DP = DA + AP? Wait, maybe I need to get this straight.\n\nLet me denote the points. Let me suppose that the line AD goes from A through D to P, but since D is outside, then actually the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then P is the other intersection with the circle. Wait, but since A is already on the circle, the other intersection would be on the other side of A from D. So, the points are arranged as A --- P ---- D, so that AP is from A to P, and PD is from P to D. Therefore, the entire length DP is equal to DA + AP? Wait, no. Wait, if the order is A---P---D, then DA is from D to A, which would be DP - AP? Hmm, maybe I need to use directed lengths here. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use algebra.\n\nLet me think in terms of Power of a Point. The Power of point D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 (since DB is tangent) and also DC\u00b2 (since DC is tangent). So Power of D is DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 = DA * DP. Here, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is the length from D to P. Since P is on line AD, then DP = DA + AP if P is beyond A from D, or DP = DA - AP if P is between D and A. Wait, but since A is on the circle and D is outside, the line AD must pass through A and then exit the circle again at P. Wait, but since A is already on the circle, the other intersection P is on the other side of A from D. So that would mean that between D and A is the segment DA, and beyond A is P. Therefore, the points are arranged as D----A----P, so DP = DA + AP. Therefore, Power of a Point gives DB\u00b2 = DA * DP = DA*(DA + AP). So that equation is DB\u00b2 = DA\u00b2 + DA*AP.\n\nHmm, okay. So if I can find DA and DB, then I can solve for AP. Alternatively, maybe express AP in terms of DA and DB. But I don't know DA or DB yet. Hmm. So perhaps I need another relation. Maybe using triangle sides and some trigonometric relations?\n\nAlternatively, maybe using coordinates? Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in coordinate plane to compute coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, use barycentric coordinates? Hmm, maybe that's more complicated. Alternatively, use the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC to find angles, then find coordinates?\n\nAlternatively, use inversion? Maybe inversion with respect to the circumcircle? Hmm, perhaps not. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, use the fact that in triangle ABC, the point D is the exsymmedian or something related to symmedian? Wait, the symmedian point is the intersection of the symmedians, but D is the intersection of tangents at B and C. The tangents at B and C meet at D, so D is the pole of side BC with respect to the circumcircle? Wait, the pole of BC would be the point where the tangents at B and C meet, yes. So D is the pole of BC. Hmm, perhaps using pole and polar concepts here?\n\nAlternatively, use harmonic division? If AD is a line through A and D, which is the pole of BC, then perhaps there is a harmonic bundle here. Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, use trigonometric approach. Let me think. Let me denote some variables.\n\nLet me first compute the circumradius of triangle ABC, since we know the sides. Maybe that can help. The sides are AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me label the triangle with vertices: Let me call the triangle ABC with AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me check if it's a valid triangle: 5 + 9 >10, 5+10>9, 9+10>5. Yes, valid.\n\nFirst, compute the circumradius R of triangle ABC. The formula for the circumradius is R = (a b c)/(4 area). Let me compute the area first. Using Heron's formula. The semi-perimeter s = (5+9+10)/2 = (24)/2 =12.\n\nArea = sqrt(s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)) = sqrt(12*(12-5)(12-9)(12-10)) = sqrt(12*7*3*2) = sqrt(12*7*6) = sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) Wait, actually, 12*7*3*2 = 12*42 = 504. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(16*31.5) no, better factor as 504 = 16*31.5? Wait, let's factor 504: 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but better to factor into primes: 504 = 8*63 = 8*7*9 = 8*7*3^2. So sqrt(504) = sqrt(8*7*9) = 3*2*sqrt(14) = 6*sqrt(14). Therefore area is 6\u221a14. Then R = (a b c)/(4 area) = (5*9*10)/(4*6\u221a14) = (450)/(24\u221a14) = (75)/(4\u221a14). Rationalizing the denominator: (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56. Hmm, so R = 75\u221a14 / 56. Not sure if this is helpful yet, but maybe.\n\nAlternatively, coordinates. Let me place point C at the origin (0,0), point B along the x-axis at (9,0), but wait, but AC is 10, AB is 5. Wait, let me think. Let me set coordinates so that it's easier. Let me set point C at (0,0), point B at (9,0). Then point A is somewhere in the plane. Let me find coordinates of A such that AC=10 and AB=5. Let coordinates of A be (x,y). Then AC distance from (0,0) to (x,y) is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) = 10, so x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100. The distance from A to B (which is at (9,0)) is sqrt((x-9)^2 + y\u00b2) =5, so (x-9)^2 + y\u00b2 =25. Subtract the two equations: (x-9)^2 + y\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =25 -100 \u21d2 x\u00b2 - 18x +81 + y\u00b2 -x\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = -75 \u21d2 -18x +81 = -75 \u21d2 -18x = -156 \u21d2 x=156/18=26/3\u22488.666...\n\nThen x=26/3. Then y\u00b2=100 -x\u00b2=100 - (676/9)= (900 -676)/9=224/9 \u21d2 y=\u00b1\u221a(224/9)=\u00b1(\u221a224)/3=\u00b1(4\u221a14)/3. Since triangle is drawn with Asymptote code having point B at (7.8,4.4899)... Hmm, maybe they placed point A at (10,0). Wait in the Asymptote code:\n\nThe Asymptote code says:\n\npair A, B, C, D, E, F, P, O;\n\nC = origin; A = (10,0); B = (7.8, 4.4899);\n\nSo in their diagram, C is at (0,0), A is at (10,0), and B is at approximately (7.8,4.4899). So maybe that's the coordinate system. Let me use that. Let me set coordinates accordingly.\n\nLet me set coordinate system with C at (0,0), A at (10,0). Then point B is somewhere in the plane. Let me compute coordinates of B. Given that AC=10 (distance from (10,0) to (0,0)), BC=9, AB=5. So coordinates of B must satisfy:\n\nDistance from B to C (0,0) is 9, so sqrt(x_B\u00b2 + y_B\u00b2)=9,\n\nDistance from B to A (10,0) is 5, so sqrt( (x_B -10)^2 + y_B\u00b2 )=5,\n\nAnd distance from B to A is 5, so:\n\n(x_B -10)^2 + y_B\u00b2 =25,\n\nand x_B\u00b2 + y_B\u00b2 =81.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n(x_B -10)^2 + y_B\u00b2 - (x_B\u00b2 + y_B\u00b2)=25 -81 \u21d2 x_B\u00b2 -20x_B +100 + y_B\u00b2 -x_B\u00b2 - y_B\u00b2 = -56 \u21d2 -20x_B +100 = -56 \u21d2 -20x_B = -156 \u21d2 x_B = 156/20 = 39/5 =7.8, which matches the Asymptote code. Then y_B\u00b2 =81 - (39/5)^2 =81 - (1521/25)= (2025 -1521)/25=504/25 \u21d2 y_B= sqrt(504)/5= (sqrt(14*36))/5= (6\u221a14)/5\u22486*3.7417/5\u224822.45/5\u22484.49, which matches the Asymptote's 4.4899. So coordinates:\n\nC=(0,0), A=(10,0), B=(39/5, (6\u221a14)/5). Let me note that as fractions for precision.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nLet me write coordinates precisely:\n\nLet me denote B as (39/5, (6\u221a14)/5). So that's (7.8, 6\u221a14/5). Let me confirm:\n\n(39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 = (1521/25) + (36*14)/25 = (1521 + 504)/25 = 2025/25 =81, which is 9\u00b2. Good.\n\nSimilarly, distance from B to A:\n\n(39/5 -10)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 = (-11/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 = (121/25)+(36*14)/25 = (121 + 504)/25 = 625/25=25, which is 5\u00b2. Good.\n\nOkay, so coordinates are set. Now, need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle.\n\nFirst, let me find the equation of the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. Since points A(10,0), B(39/5,6\u221a14/5), and C(0,0) are on the circle. Let me compute the equation of the circle.\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0. Since point C (0,0) is on the circle, plugging in gives 0 +0 +0 +0 +F=0 \u21d2 F=0. So equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nNow plug in point A (10,0):\n\n10\u00b2 +0 +10D +0 =0 \u21d2 100 +10D =0 \u21d2 D = -10.\n\nThen plug in point B (39/5,6\u221a14/5):\n\n( (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2 ) + D*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5)=0.\n\nWe know D = -10, so:\n\nFirst compute (39/5)^2 + (6\u221a14/5)^2:\n\n(1521/25) + (36*14)/25 = (1521 + 504)/25 =2025/25 =81, as before.\n\nSo equation becomes 81 + (-10)*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5)=0.\n\nCompute -10*(39/5)= -78.\n\nSo 81 -78 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 3 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 (6\u221a14/5) E = -3 \u21d2 E = (-3)*(5)/(6\u221a14) = (-15)/(6\u221a14) = (-5)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator: (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28. Wait, but let me check:\n\nWait, E = (-5)/(2\u221a14). To rationalize, multiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\nE = (-5\u221a14)/(2*14) = (-5\u221a14)/28. So that's E.\n\nTherefore, the equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5\u221a14/28)*28 y? Wait, no, let me write the equation again.\n\nWait, the equation was x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0, with D=-10 and E= -5/(2\u221a14). Wait, actually, no. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, we had:\n\nAfter plugging in point B:\n\nThe equation is:\n\n81 + (-10)*(39/5) + E*(6\u221a14/5) =0.\n\nWait, 81 - 78 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 3 + (6\u221a14/5) E =0 \u21d2 E = (-3)*(5)/(6\u221a14) = -15/(6\u221a14) = -5/(2\u221a14). So yes, E = -5/(2\u221a14). So the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + (-5/(2\u221a14)) y =0. Hmm, this might be a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to write in standard form by completing the squares.\n\nStarting with x\u00b2 -10x + y\u00b2 + (-5/(2\u221a14)) y =0.\n\nCompleting the square for x:\n\nx\u00b2 -10x = (x -5)^2 -25.\n\nFor y terms:\n\ny\u00b2 - (5/(2\u221a14)) y = [y - (5/(4\u221a14))]^2 - (25)/(16*14). Wait, let me compute:\n\nLet me denote the coefficient of y as - (5/(2\u221a14)), so half of that is -5/(4\u221a14), square is 25/(16*14). Therefore:\n\ny\u00b2 - (5/(2\u221a14)) y = [y - 5/(4\u221a14)]\u00b2 - 25/(16*14).\n\nTherefore the entire equation becomes:\n\n(x -5)^2 -25 + [y -5/(4\u221a14)]\u00b2 -25/(16*14) =0\n\nSo,\n\n(x -5)^2 + [y -5/(4\u221a14)]\u00b2 = 25 + 25/(16*14)\n\nCompute the right-hand side:\n\n25 is 25*(16*14)/(16*14) = (25*224)/224.\n\n25/(16*14) =25/224.\n\nSo total is (25*224 +25)/224 =25*(224 +1)/224 =25*225/224 = (25*225)/224. Therefore the radius squared is (25*225)/224. Hmm, complicated. Maybe not the best path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of computing the equation of the circle, compute the tangent lines at B and C, then find their intersection D.\n\nThe tangent at point C (0,0). The tangent at C to the circle. The general formula for the tangent at point (x0,y0) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F=0 is xx0 + yy0 + D(x + x0)/2 + E(y + y0)/2 + F=0. Wait, maybe better to recall that the tangent line at point P on a circle with center (h,k) is (x_P - h)(x - h) + (y_P - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? Wait, no, the standard tangent line formula is (x1)(x) + (y1)(y) + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0, but perhaps I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since the tangent at point C (0,0). The tangent line at C can be found using the fact that the radius is perpendicular to the tangent. The center of the circle is (5, k), since from the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0, the center is at (D/2, E/2) with signs adjusted. Wait, the general form is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, so center is (-D/2, -E/2). So here, D = -10, E = -5/(2\u221a14). Wait, so center is at (-(-10)/2, - ( -5/(2\u221a14) ) /2 )? Wait, hold on. Wait the formula is center at (-D/2, -E/2). So D is coefficient of x, which is -10, so -D/2 = 5. The E term is coefficient of y, which is -5/(2\u221a14). Wait, actually, in the equation, the coefficient E is multiplied by y, so in the equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0, so center is (-D/2, -E/2). So here, D is -10, so -D/2 =5, and E is (-5/(2\u221a14)), so -E/2 = (5/(2\u221a14))/2 =5/(4\u221a14). Therefore center is at (5, 5/(4\u221a14)). Hmm, complicated coordinates. Let me note that as O=(5, 5/(4\u221a14)).\n\nTherefore, the tangent at point C (0,0) is perpendicular to the radius OC. The radius OC is from center (5,5/(4\u221a14)) to point C (0,0). The direction vector of OC is (-5, -5/(4\u221a14)). Therefore, the tangent line at C is perpendicular to this. So the slope of OC is (\u0394y/\u0394x)= [5/(4\u221a14) -0]/[5 -0] = [5/(4\u221a14)] /5 =1/(4\u221a14). Therefore the slope of the tangent line is the negative reciprocal, which is -4\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C is a line passing through C(0,0) with slope -4\u221a14. So its equation is y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\nSimilarly, compute the tangent at B. Let me compute the tangent at point B (39/5,6\u221a14/5). The radius OB goes from center O(5,5/(4\u221a14)) to B(39/5,6\u221a14/5). Let me compute the direction vector of OB:\n\n\u0394x = 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5,\n\n\u0394y = (6\u221a14/5 - 5/(4\u221a14)).\n\nHmm, this is getting messy. Let me compute \u0394y:\n\nFirst, express both terms with a common denominator. Let me compute 6\u221a14/5 and 5/(4\u221a14):\n\nLet me write 5/(4\u221a14) as (5\u221a14)/(4*14) = (5\u221a14)/56. Wait, but maybe better to just compute numerically?\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the slope of OB.\n\nSlope of OB is [ (6\u221a14/5 - 5/(4\u221a14)) ] / (14/5).\n\nThis is going to be a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps compute the equation of the tangent at B using point-form.\n\nThe tangent at point (x1,y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F=0 is xx1 + yy1 + D(x + x1)/2 + E(y + y1)/2 + F =0. Wait, let me confirm the formula for tangent line.\n\nAlternatively, the equation of the tangent line at point P(x1,y1) on the circle with center (h,k) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? No, that's not right. Wait, the standard tangent line equation for a circle with center (h,k) at point (x1,y1) is (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2? No, actually, it's (x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2 only if (x1,y1) is on the circle, but that's equivalent to the equation of the circle. Wait, no.\n\nActually, the correct equation is:\n\nThe tangent line at point (x1,y1) on the circle (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r\u00b2 is:\n\n(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2.\n\nWait, but since (x1,y1) is on the circle, (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2 = r\u00b2, so the left side when x=x1 and y=y1 gives r\u00b2 = r\u00b2, so that works. Wait, but actually, the standard tangent line equation is:\n\n(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2. Wait, but that's actually the equation of the polar line, but perhaps for the tangent, since (x1,y1) is on the circle, it is indeed the tangent.\n\nAlternatively, the equation can be written as:\n\n(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2. Hmm, but this seems to be the same as the equation of the circle, so maybe not. Wait, actually, expanding that equation:\n\n(x1 - h)(x - h) + (y1 - k)(y - k) = r\u00b2,\n\nExpanding:\n\n(x1 x - x1 h - h x + h\u00b2) + (y1 y - y1 k - k y + k\u00b2) = r\u00b2,\n\nGroup terms:\n\nx1 x + y1 y - h(x1 + x) - k(y1 + y) + h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2,\n\nBut since (x1 - h)^2 + (y1 - k)^2 = r\u00b2,\n\nSo h\u00b2 + k\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + 2 h x1 - x1\u00b2 + 2 k y1 - y1\u00b2,\n\nWait, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try with coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since I know the center O(5,5/(4\u221a14)), the tangent at point B is perpendicular to the radius OB. So, the slope of OB is (yB - yO)/(xB - xO). Let me compute that.\n\nCoordinates of O: (5, 5/(4\u221a14)),\n\nCoordinates of B: (39/5, 6\u221a14/5).\n\nCompute \u0394x = 39/5 -5 = 39/5 -25/5 =14/5,\n\n\u0394y = (6\u221a14/5 -5/(4\u221a14)).\n\nLet me compute \u0394y:\n\nFirst term: 6\u221a14/5,\n\nSecond term: 5/(4\u221a14). Let me rationalize the denominator:\n\n5/(4\u221a14) = (5\u221a14)/(4*14) = (5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo \u0394y = (6\u221a14)/5 - (5\u221a14)/56 = \u221a14*(6/5 -5/56).\n\nCompute 6/5 -5/56: common denominator 280,\n\n6/5 = 336/280,\n\n5/56 =25/280,\n\nSo 336/280 -25/280 =311/280,\n\nThus \u0394y = \u221a14*(311/280).\n\nTherefore, the slope of OB is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = [\u221a14*(311/280)] / (14/5) = [\u221a14 *311 /280 ] * [5/14] = \u221a14 *311*5 / (280*14).\n\nSimplify denominators:\n\n280*14 = 3920,\n\nNumerator: 311*5\u221a14 =1555\u221a14,\n\nThus slope of OB is (1555\u221a14)/3920. Hmm, this is getting very messy. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the tangent at B is perpendicular to OB, so its slope is negative reciprocal of the slope of OB.\n\nBut this is going to be complicated. Maybe I can parametrize the tangent line equations using point-slope form once I have the slope.\n\nAlternatively, since this is getting too algebraically intensive, maybe use parametric equations or vector approaches?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the fact that the tangent at C is y = -4\u221a14 x as previously found. Let me confirm that.\n\nEarlier, for the tangent at C (0,0): the center is (5,5/(4\u221a14)), so the radius vector is from center to C is (-5, -5/(4\u221a14)). Therefore the tangent line is perpendicular to this vector. The direction vector of the tangent line should be perpendicular to (-5, -5/(4\u221a14)), so direction vector (a,b) must satisfy -5a - (5/(4\u221a14))b =0 \u21d2 5a = - (5/(4\u221a14))b \u21d2 a = - (1/(4\u221a14)) b. So a direction vector could be ( -1/(4\u221a14), 1 ). So the tangent line at C has direction ( -1/(4\u221a14),1 ). Since it passes through (0,0), the equation can be parametrized as t*(-1/(4\u221a14),1). But slope would be rise over run: 1 / (-1/(4\u221a14)) = -4\u221a14, so yes, the slope is indeed -4\u221a14. So the tangent at C is y = -4\u221a14 x. Good.\n\nNow, need the tangent at B. Let me try to find its equation.\n\nLet me denote point B as (x_B, y_B) = (39/5, 6\u221a14/5). The tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB. The slope of OB is (y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O). Let me compute y_O =5/(4\u221a14), x_O=5.\n\nSo slope of OB:\n\n(y_B - y_O)/(x_B - x_O) = (6\u221a14/5 -5/(4\u221a14)) / (39/5 -5).\n\nCompute denominator first: 39/5 -25/5 =14/5.\n\nNumerator:\n\n6\u221a14/5 -5/(4\u221a14). Let me write both terms over a common denominator, which would be 20\u221a14:\n\nFirst term: 6\u221a14/5 = (6\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(5*4\u221a14) Hmm, perhaps better to convert to have same denominators:\n\nLet me write 6\u221a14/5 as (6\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(5*4\u221a14) no, perhaps compute numerically?\n\nWait, let me rationalize the second term:\n\n5/(4\u221a14) = (5\u221a14)/(4*14) = (5\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo the numerator becomes 6\u221a14/5 -5\u221a14/56.\n\nFactor out \u221a14:\n\n\u221a14*(6/5 -5/56).\n\nCompute 6/5 -5/56:\n\nConvert to 280 denominator:\n\n6/5 = 336/280,\n\n5/56 =25/280,\n\nSo 336/280 -25/280 = 311/280.\n\nTherefore numerator is \u221a14*(311/280).\n\nThus slope of OB is [\u221a14*(311/280)] / (14/5) = [\u221a14 *311/280] / (14/5) = [\u221a14 *311/280] * [5/14] = [\u221a14 *311 *5 ] / (280*14).\n\nSimplify denominator: 280*14 = 3920,\n\nNumerator: 311*5\u221a14 =1555\u221a14,\n\nSo slope of OB is (1555\u221a14)/3920. Let me simplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 5:\n\n1555 \u00f75 =311, 3920 \u00f75=784,\n\nSo slope is (311\u221a14)/784.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent line at B is the negative reciprocal of that, so:\n\nm_tangent = - (784)/(311\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a14:\n\nm_tangent = - (784\u221a14)/(311*14) = - (784/14)*(\u221a14)/311 = -56*(\u221a14)/311.\n\nThus, the slope of the tangent at B is -56\u221a14/311.\n\nTherefore, the tangent line at B has slope m = -56\u221a14/311 and passes through point B (39/5,6\u221a14/5). So its equation is:\n\ny -6\u221a14/5 = m (x -39/5).\n\nNow, we have the two tangent lines:\n\n1. Tangent at C: y = -4\u221a14 x.\n\n2. Tangent at B: y = [ -56\u221a14/311 ](x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nWe need to find their intersection point D.\n\nLet me set the two equations equal:\n\n-4\u221a14 x = [ -56\u221a14/311 ](x -39/5) +6\u221a14/5.\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14 from all terms:\n\n\u221a14 [ -4x ] = \u221a14 [ -56/311 (x -39/5) +6/5 ]\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a14 (since \u221a14 \u22600):\n\n-4x = -56/311 (x - 39/5) +6/5.\n\nNow, solve for x.\n\nLet me write the equation:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x - 39/5) + 6/5.\n\nMultiply all terms by 311*5 to eliminate denominators:\n\n-4x *311*5 = -56*5(x -39/5) +6*311.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nLeft side: -4*5*311 x = -6220x.\n\nRight side:\n\nFirst term: -56*5(x -39/5) = -280(x) + 280*(39/5) = -280x + (280*39)/5 = -280x + 56*39 = -280x + 2184.\n\nSecond term: 6*311 =1866.\n\nSo total right side: (-280x +2184) +1866 = -280x + (2184 +1866)= -280x +4050.\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\n-6220x = -280x +4050.\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n-6220x +280x -4050 =0 \u21d2 -5940x -4050 =0 \u21d2 -5940x =4050 \u21d2 x= -4050/5940.\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 90: 4050 \u00f790=45, 5940 \u00f790=66.\n\nThus x= -45/66 = -15/22.\n\nWait, that's negative? But in the Asymptote code, point D was drawn at some coordinate, but maybe in our coordinate system it's at x negative?\n\nWait, let's check the calculations again, because getting x negative might be okay, but let me verify step by step.\n\nStarting from:\n\n-4x = (-56/311)(x -39/5) +6/5.\n\nMultiply both sides by 311*5:\n\nLeft side: -4x *311*5 = -6220x.\n\nRight side first term: (-56/311)(x -39/5)*311*5 = -56*5*(x -39/5) = -280*(x -39/5) = -280x + (280*39)/5 = -280x + (280/5)*39 = -280x +56*39 = -280x +2184.\n\nSecond term: 6/5 *311*5=6*311=1866.\n\nThus total right side: -280x +2184 +1866 = -280x +4050. Correct.\n\nSo equation: -6220x = -280x +4050 \u21d2 -6220x +280x =4050 \u21d2 -5940x=4050 \u21d2 x= -4050/5940.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 10: -405/594.\n\nDivide by 9: -45/66, then divide by 3: -15/22. So x= -15/22 \u2248-0.6818.\n\nHmm, so x-coordinate is negative. That might be okay since in the Asymptote code, point D was at (IP(B..E + (B-E)*4, C..F + (C-F)*-3)), which might place it in a different quadrant. Anyway, proceeding.\n\nNow, substitute x= -15/22 into tangent at C's equation to find y:\n\ny= -4\u221a14 x = -4\u221a14*(-15/22)= (60\u221a14)/22 = (30\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of D are ( -15/22, 30\u221a14/11 ).\n\nNow, need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nFirst, let's find the parametric equation of line AD. Points A(10,0) and D(-15/22, 30\u221a14/11). Let me compute the direction vector from A to D:\n\n\u0394x = -15/22 -10 = -15/22 -220/22 = -235/22,\n\n\u0394y = 30\u221a14/11 -0 =30\u221a14/11.\n\nThus parametric equations for line AD can be written as:\n\nx =10 + t*(-235/22),\n\ny =0 + t*(30\u221a14/11),\n\nwhere t=0 gives A, t=1 gives D, and we need to find the other intersection point P, which would correspond to some t \u22600,1.\n\nWe need to find t such that (x(t), y(t)) lies on the circumcircle \u03c9.\n\nThe equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0, where E was found earlier as -5/(2\u221a14).\n\nWait, let me recall the equation. The equation was x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x + Ey =0 with E = -5/(2\u221a14). So substituting coordinates into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5/(2\u221a14)) y =0.\n\nPlugging in x(t) and y(t):\n\n[ (10 - (235/22)t )\u00b2 + ( (30\u221a14/11)t )\u00b2 ] -10*(10 - (235/22)t ) - (5/(2\u221a14))*(30\u221a14/11 t ) =0.\n\nThis looks quite involved, but let's compute term by term.\n\nFirst, expand (x(t))\u00b2:\n\nx(t) =10 - (235/22)t,\n\nso x(t)^2 = [10 - (235/22)t]^2 =100 - 2*10*(235/22)t + (235/22)^2 t\u00b2 =100 - (4700/22)t + (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) t\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, y(t)^2 = (30\u221a14/11 t)^2 = (900*14)/121 t\u00b2 = (12600)/121 t\u00b2.\n\nNext term: -10x(t) = -10*(10 - (235/22)t )= -100 + (2350/22)t.\n\nNext term: - (5/(2\u221a14))*(30\u221a14/11 t ) = - (5*30\u221a14)/(2\u221a14*11) t = - (150)/(22) t = - (75/11) t.\n\nPutting all terms together:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -10x - (5/(2\u221a14)) y =\n\n[100 - (4700/22)t + (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) t\u00b2 + 12600/121 t\u00b2] +\n\n[-100 + (2350/22)t] +\n\n[-75/11 t] =0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst group (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2):\n\n100 - (4700/22)t + [ (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) + 12600/121 ] t\u00b2.\n\nSecond group (-10x):\n\n-100 + (2350/22)t.\n\nThird group (- (5/(2\u221a14)) y):\n\n-75/11 t.\n\nCombine all terms:\n\n100 - (4700/22)t + [ (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) + 12600/121 ] t\u00b2 -100 + (2350/22)t - (75/11)t =0.\n\nSimplify constants: 100 -100 =0.\n\nCombine the terms with t:\n\n[ -4700/22 +2350/22 -75/11 ] t.\n\nConvert -75/11 to -150/22 to have common denominator:\n\n-4700/22 +2350/22 -150/22 = (-4700 +2350 -150)/22 = (-4700 +2200)/22 = (-2500)/22.\n\nThe t\u00b2 term:\n\n[ (235\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) +12600/121 ] t\u00b2. Note that 121 is 11\u00b2, and 22\u00b2 is 484.\n\nLet me compute 235\u00b2: 235*235. 200\u00b2=40000, 35\u00b2=1225, 2*200*35=14000, so (200+35)^2=200\u00b2 +2*200*35 +35\u00b2=40000+14000+1225=55225. So 235\u00b2=55225.\n\nThus,\n\n55225/(22\u00b2) +12600/121 = 55225/484 +12600/121.\n\nConvert to common denominator 484:\n\n12600/121 = (12600*4)/484 =50400/484.\n\nThus total t\u00b2 term:\n\n(55225 +50400)/484 =105625/484.\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n(105625/484) t\u00b2 - (2500/22) t =0.\n\nFactor out t:\n\nt [ (105625/484) t -2500/22 ] =0.\n\nSolutions are t=0 (point A) and t= (2500/22)/(105625/484).\n\nCompute the second solution:\n\nt = (2500/22) * (484/105625).\n\nSimplify fractions:\n\nFirst, 484 /22 =22, so 2500/22 *484/105625 =2500*(484)/(22*105625).\n\n484 divided by 22 is 22, so:\n\n2500 *22 /105625.\n\n2500 divided by 25 is 100, 105625 divided by25 is 4225.\n\nWait, perhaps factor numerator and denominator:\n\n2500 = 25*100,\n\n4225=25*169,\n\nWait, 105625 \u00f725=4225. 4225 is 65\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\n2500*22 /105625 = (25*100 *22)/(25*4225) )= (100*22)/4225 = 2200/4225.\n\nSimplify 2200/4225: divide numerator and denominator by 25: 88/169.\n\nWait, 2200 \u00f725=88, 4225 \u00f725=169.\n\nThus t=88/169.\n\nTherefore, the parameter t for point P is 88/169.\n\nTherefore, coordinates of P are:\n\nx =10 + (88/169)*(-235/22),\n\ny =0 + (88/169)*(30\u221a14/11).\n\nLet me compute x first:\n\nFirst, simplify (88/169)*(-235/22):\n\n88 and 22 can be simplified: 88/22=4, so:\n\n4*(-235)/169 = (-940)/169.\n\nThus x=10 -940/169.\n\nConvert 10 to 1690/169,\n\nSo x= (1690 -940)/169 =750/169.\n\nSimilarly, y-coordinate:\n\n(88/169)*(30\u221a14/11)= (8*30\u221a14)/(169*1) because 88/11=8,\n\nSo 240\u221a14 /169.\n\nThus coordinates of P are (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nNow, need to compute the distance AP. Since point A is at (10,0), and P is at (750/169, 240\u221a14/169).\n\nCompute AP using distance formula:\n\nAP = sqrt[ ( (750/169 -10)^2 + (240\u221a14/169 -0)^2 ) ].\n\nFirst compute 750/169 -10 =750/169 -1690/169 = (750 -1690)/169 = (-940)/169.\n\nThus,\n\nAP = sqrt[ ( (-940/169)^2 + (240\u221a14/169)^2 ) ]\n\nFactor out (1/169)^2:\n\nsqrt[ (1/169\u00b2)(940\u00b2 + (240\u00b2)(14) ) ] = (1/169) sqrt(940\u00b2 +240\u00b2*14).\n\nCompute inside the sqrt:\n\nFirst compute 940\u00b2:\n\n940\u00b2: 900\u00b2=810000, 40\u00b2=1600, 2*900*40=72000, so (900+40)^2= 810000 +72000 +1600= 883600.\n\n240\u00b2=57600,\n\n240\u00b2*14=57600*14=806,400.\n\nThus total inside sqrt:\n\n883,600 +806,400 =1,690,000.\n\nTherefore sqrt(1,690,000)=1300.\n\nThus AP = (1/169)*1300 =1300/169.\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by13:\n\n1300 \u00f713=100,\n\n169 \u00f713=13.\n\nThus AP=100/13.\n\nCheck if 100 and13 are coprime: yes, since 13 is prime and doesn't divide 100. Therefore, m=100, n=13, so m +n=113.\n\nWait, but let me check calculations again because this seems straightforward but let me verify:\n\nFirst, the coordinates of P were (750/169, 240\u221a14/169). The difference from A (10,0):\n\n\u0394x=750/169 -10 = (750 - 1690)/169 = (-940)/169,\n\n\u0394y=240\u221a14/169 -0 =240\u221a14/169,\n\nThen squared terms:\n\n(\u0394x)^2 = (940)^2/(169)^2,\n\n(\u0394y)^2 = (240^2 *14)/(169)^2,\n\nThus sum:\n\n(940\u00b2 +240\u00b2*14)/169\u00b2,\n\nCalculating numerator:\n\n940\u00b2= (900+40)^2=900\u00b2 +2*900*40 +40\u00b2=810000+72000+1600=883,600,\n\n240\u00b2*14=57,600*14=806,400,\n\nTotal numerator: 883,600 +806,400=1,690,000,\n\n\u221a(1,690,000)=1300,\n\nThus sqrt(...) is 1300/(169),\n\nSo AP=1300/169= (1300 \u00f713)/(169 \u00f713)=100/13. Correct.\n\nSo m=100, n=13, which are coprime. Thus m +n=113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the length of \\(AP\\) in triangle \\(ABC\\) inscribed in circle \\(\\omega\\). The tangents to \\(\\omega\\) at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) intersect at point \\(D\\), and line \\(AD\\) intersects \\(\\omega\\) again at \\(P\\). The sides of triangle \\(ABC\\) are given as \\(AB = 5\\), \\(BC = 9\\), and \\(AC = 10\\). \n\nFirst, we use the Power of a Point theorem, which states that the power of point \\(D\\) with respect to \\(\\omega\\) is equal to \\(DB^2 = DC^2 = DA \\cdot DP\\). \n\nWe place the triangle in a coordinate system with \\(C\\) at the origin \\((0,0)\\), \\(A\\) at \\((10,0)\\), and \\(B\\) at \\(\\left(\\frac{39}{5}, \\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{5}\\right)\\). We then find the equations of the tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) to the circumcircle \\(\\omega\\).\n\nThe tangent at \\(C\\) is found to be \\(y = -4\\sqrt{14}x\\). The tangent at \\(B\\) is calculated using the slope perpendicular to the radius \\(OB\\), resulting in the equation \\(y = \\left(-\\frac{56\\sqrt{14}}{311}\\right)(x - \\frac{39}{5}) + \\frac{6\\sqrt{14}}{5}\\).\n\nSolving the intersection of these tangents gives the coordinates of \\(D\\) as \\(\\left(-\\frac{15}{22}, \\frac{30\\sqrt{14}}{11}\\right)\\).\n\nNext, we parameterize line \\(AD\\) and find its intersection with the circumcircle \\(\\omega\\) again at point \\(P\\). Using parametric equations and substituting into the circle's equation, we solve for the parameter \\(t\\) and find the coordinates of \\(P\\) as \\(\\left(\\frac{750}{169}, \\frac{240\\sqrt{14}}{169}\\right)\\).\n\nFinally, we compute the distance \\(AP\\) using the distance formula. The coordinates of \\(A\\) are \\((10,0)\\), and the coordinates of \\(P\\) are \\(\\left(\\frac{750}{169}, \\frac{240\\sqrt{14}}{169}\\right)\\). Calculating the distance, we find \\(AP = \\frac{100}{13}\\).\n\nThus, \\(m = 100\\) and \\(n = 13\\), leading to \\(m + n = 113\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{113}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects the circle again at P. The sides are given as AB=5, BC=9, and AC=10. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, since D is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle \u03c9, D is the exsymmedian point or something? Wait, actually, the intersection of the tangents at B and C is called the symmedian point? Or is that different? Maybe I should recall that the point where the two tangents meet to a circle at two points is called the exsimilicenter or something? Maybe not. Anyway, perhaps I can use some properties related to pole and polar lines here.\n\nAlternatively, since D lies on the tangents at B and C, then DB = DC because the lengths from D to the points of tangency are equal. Wait, actually, the lengths from D to B and C are not necessarily equal, but the lengths of the tangents from D to the circle are equal. Since D is on the tangent at B, the tangent from D to \u03c9 at B, so the length DB is equal to the length of the tangent from D to \u03c9. Similarly, DC is also the tangent length from D to \u03c9. Wait, so actually DB = DC? Because both are tangent segments from D to the circle. Oh yes, that's right! The two tangent segments from a single external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, DB = DC. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB=DC. Hmm, that might be useful.\n\nNow, perhaps I can use power of a point. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the tangent length is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points of intersection with the circle along any secant line. So for point D, since DA is a secant that goes through A and P, then we have DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. Since DB is the tangent, so DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. That seems useful.\n\nSo if I can compute DB\u00b2 and DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = AD - DP? Wait, no, AP is from A to P, but AD is from A to D, so actually, AP is part of AD. Wait, AD is a secant that starts at A, goes through D, and then meets the circle again at P. Wait, actually, hold on: the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P. Wait, but if D is outside the circle, then AD would start at A (on the circle), go through D (outside), and then P is another intersection point? Wait, but A is already on the circle, so when AD is extended beyond D, it meets the circle again at P? Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Let the tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D, and let AD intersect \u03c9 at P.\" So AD starts at A, goes through D, and intersects \u03c9 again at P. So starting from A, going through D, and then hitting the circle again at P. Therefore, the order is A---P---D along the line AD. Wait, but if D is outside the circle, then starting from A (on the circle), going through D (outside), so the other intersection point would be beyond D? Wait, that would mean that AP is from A to P, but if P is between A and D, then AP would be shorter than AD. Alternatively, maybe the line AD is extended beyond A to meet the circle again? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the diagram.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, they have:\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndraw(A..B..C..cycle, red+dotted); which is the circumcircle.\n\nThen O is the circumcenter.\n\nThen E and F are rotations of O by 90 degrees? Wait, maybe not. The code says E = rotate(90,B) * (O); which might be rotating point O 90 degrees around B, but that might be for drawing the tangent lines? Hmm, perhaps the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, so the tangent line at B is perpendicular to OB. So to draw the tangent line at B, they might be constructing a line perpendicular to OB at point B. Similarly for the tangent at C.\n\nThen D is the intersection point of the two tangents at B and C. So D is outside the circle, as tangents from an external point.\n\nThen AD is drawn, and P is the intersection of AD with the circle again. Since A is already on the circle, so the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then exits the circle again at P? Wait, that can't be because if D is outside the circle, then going from A through D would go outward, so P would be the second intersection point, meaning that AP is from A through D to P, but then AP would be longer than AD. Wait, perhaps the Asymptote code says:\n\nP = IP(D..A, A..B..C); which might mean the intersection of line DA with the circle, other than A. So P is the second point of intersection, so the order is A---P---D? Wait, but if you go from D towards A, then the first intersection with the circle is P, then A. So AP would be from A to P, but since A is on the circle, P is another point, so AP is a chord passing through D. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think in terms of coordinates or use some theorem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use harmonic division or projective geometry? Hmm, maybe inversion?\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in coordinate plane. Maybe set point C at the origin to simplify. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nLet me set point C at (0,0). Let me set point B at (9, 0), but wait, BC is 9, but AC is 10, AB is 5. Wait, maybe coordinate system setup needs to be done carefully.\n\nAlternatively, let me place point C at (0,0), point B at (x, 0), and point A somewhere in the plane. Let me try.\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nLet me let point C be at (0,0), point B at (b, 0), and point A somewhere in the plane. Then AC = 10, BC =9, so since BC is from (0,0) to (b,0), so BC length is |b| = 9, so b=9. So point B is at (9,0). Then point A is somewhere such that AB=5 and AC=10. So coordinates of A must satisfy distance from A to C (0,0) is 10, and distance from A to B (9,0) is 5. Let me find coordinates of A.\n\nLet me let coordinates of A be (x,y). Then:\n\nFrom AC =10: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100,\n\nFrom AB=5: (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x -9)^2 + y\u00b2] = 100 -25,\n\nExpand: x\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 -18x +81) =75,\n\nSimplify: 18x -81 =75,\n\n18x = 156,\n\nx = 156 / 18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nThen substitute back to find y:\n\nx = 26/3, so x\u00b2 = (676)/9,\n\nThen y\u00b2 = 100 - (676/9) = (900 - 676)/9 = 224/9,\n\nThus y = \u00b1\u221a(224/9) = \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3.\n\nHmm, so coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3) or (26/3, -4\u221a14/3). Since the triangle is drawn with the Asymptote code showing point A at (10,0), but in the code's coordinate system, but in my setup, maybe it's in a different orientation. Let me pick the positive y-coordinate for A, so (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nA: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3 )\n\nNow, need to find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. Let me compute the circumradius or the equation of the circumcircle.\n\nAlternatively, since I have coordinates for A, B, C, I can find the equation of the circle passing through these three points.\n\nLet me denote the general equation of a circle as:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlugging in point C (0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nNow plug in point B (9,0):\n\n9\u00b2 +0 + 9D +0 =0 \u21d281 +9D =0 \u21d2 D = -81/9 = -9.\n\nSo equation now is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + Ey =0.\n\nNow plug in point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\n( (26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 ) -9*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (26/3)^2 = (676)/9,\n\n(4\u221a14 /3)^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9,\n\nTotal first part: (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100.\n\nSecond term: -9*(26/3) = -78.\n\nThird term: E*(4\u221a14 /3).\n\nSo putting together:\n\n100 -78 + (4\u221a14 /3) E =0 \u21d222 + (4\u221a14 /3) E =0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14 /3) E = -22 \u21d2 E = (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing denominator:\n\nE = (-33)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-33\u221a14)/(28).\n\nTherefore the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way? Alternatively, perhaps compute the circumradius using the formula:\n\nR = (a b c)/(4\u0394), where a,b,c are sides, and \u0394 is area.\n\nGiven triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.\n\nWait, sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me confirm the sides:\n\nAB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So sides a, b, c opposite to angles A,B,C respectively? Wait, standard notation is a opposite A, but maybe better to note:\n\nLet me denote sides as:\n\na = BC =9,\n\nb = AC=10,\n\nc = AB=5.\n\nThen the semiperimeter s = (a + b +c)/2 = (9+10+5)/2=24/2=12.\n\nArea \u0394 can be computed via Heron's formula:\n\n\u0394 = \u221a[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)] = \u221a[12(12-9)(12-10)(12-5)] = \u221a[12*3*2*7] = \u221a[504] = \u221a[16*31.5] Wait, 504=16*31.5? Wait, 12*3=36, 36*2=72, 72*7=504. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)= but 504= 16*31.5 is not exact. Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but perhaps factor into primes:\n\n504= 2^3 * 3^2 *7. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(2^3 *3^2 *7)= 2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7)= 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)= 6*sqrt(14). Wait:\n\nWait, 2^3 is 8, 3^2 is 9, so 8*9*7=504. Then sqrt(504)=sqrt(8*9*7)=sqrt(8)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(7)= 2\u221a2 *3*\u221a7=6\u221a14. Yes, that's correct. So area is 6\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the circumradius R = (a b c)/(4\u0394) = (9 *10 *5)/(4*6\u221a14) = (450)/(24\u221a14) = (75)/(4\u221a14). Rationalizing denominator:\n\n75/(4\u221a14) * \u221a14/\u221a14 = (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56. So R = 75\u221a14 /56.\n\nHmm, okay. Not sure if this will be helpful yet, but maybe useful later.\n\nNow, going back to the problem. We need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle.\n\nThe tangent at B: since the circle has equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0, the tangent at point B (9,0).\n\nThe equation of the tangent at point (x1,y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey +F =0 is:\n\nx x1 + y y1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0 ?\n\nWait, maybe better to recall the formula for tangent at (x1,y1) is:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0 ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using derivative? Alternatively, since the tangent at point B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center of the circle.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute the center of the circle first.\n\nGiven the equation of the circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0,\n\nThe general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, so center is (-D/2, -E/2).\n\nThus, center O has coordinates:\n\nx-coordinate: -(-9)/2 = 9/2,\n\ny-coordinate: -[ - (33\u221a14)/28 ] /2 = (33\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo O is at (9/2, 33\u221a14 /56).\n\nTherefore, the radius vector from O to B (9,0) is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14 /56 ) = (9/2, -33\u221a14 /56 ).\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to this radius. So the direction vector of the radius is (9/2, -33\u221a14 /56 ), so the tangent line at B will have a direction perpendicular to that. The slope of the radius is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = [ -33\u221a14 /56 ] / (9/2 ) = [ -33\u221a14 /56 ] * [2/9] = (-66\u221a14)/(504) = (-11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the radius is m_r = (-11\u221a14)/84, so the slope of the tangent line is the negative reciprocal, which is m_t = 84/(11\u221a14).\n\nSimplify m_t: 84/(11\u221a14) can be rationalized as 84\u221a14/(11*14) = 6\u221a14/11. Because 84 divided by 14 is 6. So m_t = (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent line at B has slope (6\u221a14)/11 and passes through point B (9,0). So its equation is:\n\ny -0 = (6\u221a14 /11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute the tangent at point C (0,0). Wait, point C is (0,0). The tangent at C: the radius from O to C is the vector from O (9/2, 33\u221a14 /56) to C (0,0), which is (-9/2, -33\u221a14 /56 ). The slope of the radius is [ -33\u221a14 /56 ] / (-9/2 ) = (33\u221a14 /56 ) / (9/2 ) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent line at C is the negative reciprocal of that, so m_t = -84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing similarly:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C (0,0) has slope -6\u221a14/11, so its equation is:\n\ny -0 = (-6\u221a14 /11)(x -0) \u2192 y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x.\n\nSo now we have equations for both tangents:\n\nTangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\nTangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nFind their intersection point D. Set the two equations equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nSo x -9 = -x \u2192 2x =9 \u2192 x= 9/2.\n\nThen plug back into tangent at C's equation:\n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/(22) = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, point D has coordinates (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, okay. Now, need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle. Since A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3), and D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me parametrize line AD.\n\nFirst, let me write coordinates for points A and D:\n\nA: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3 )\n\nD: (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 )\n\nLet me write the parametric equations for line AD. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1 for points from A to D, but since we need the extension beyond D to find P, maybe parameter t will go beyond 1.\n\nParametric equations:\n\nx(t) = x_A + t*(x_D - x_A)\n\ny(t) = y_A + t*(y_D - y_A)\n\nCompute the differences:\n\n\u0394x = x_D - x_A = (9/2 - 26/3) = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6)\n\n\u0394y = y_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3 ) = \u221a14*(-81/33 -44/33)= \u221a14*(-125/33)\n\nSo parametric equations:\n\nx(t) = 26/3 + t*(-25/6 )\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 + t*(-125\u221a14/33 )\n\nWe need to find the point P \u2260 A on the circumcircle along this line. Since A is already on the circle, the other intersection P corresponds to the other solution of the parametric equations when substituted into the circle's equation.\n\nLet me substitute x(t) and y(t) into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nThis might get very algebra-heavy, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let me denote:\n\nLet me write x(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t.\n\nLet me compute x(t)^2:\n\n[26/3 - (25/6)t]^2 = (26/3)^2 - 2*(26/3)*(25/6)t + (25/6 t)^2\n\nSimilarly, y(t)^2:\n\n[ (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t ]^2 = (4\u221a14/3)^2 - 2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14/33)t + (125\u221a14/33 t)^2\n\nThis is going to be very tedious, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Since we know that when t=0, we are at point A, which is on the circle, so the equation will be satisfied. The other solution corresponds to t value where P is located. Let me denote t=1 corresponds to point D. Wait, but D is outside the circle, so P is beyond D? Since when t=1, we are at D, so perhaps t>1 to get to P?\n\nAlternatively, let me set up the equation and solve for t. Let me denote:\n\nLet me substitute x(t) and y(t) into the circle equation. Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute x(t)^2 + y(t)^2:\n\nLet me compute x(t)^2:\n\nLet me write x(t) = (26/3) - (25/6)t. Let me write all terms over 6 to combine:\n\n= (52/6 -25/6 t) = (52 -25t)/6.\n\nTherefore, x(t)^2 = (52 -25t)^2 / 36.\n\nSimilarly, y(t) = [ (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14)/33 t ]\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n= \u221a14 [4/3 - (125/33)t ]\n\nLet me write 4/3 as 44/33, so:\n\n= \u221a14 [44/33 - 125/33 t ] = \u221a14*(44 -125t)/33.\n\nTherefore, y(t)^2 = 14*(44 -125t)^2 / (33^2).\n\nSo, x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = [ (52 -25t)^2 ] /36 + [14*(44 -125t)^2 ] / (33^2).\n\nNow compute -9x(t):\n\n-9*( (52 -25t)/6 ) = - (9/6)*(52 -25t) = - (3/2)(52 -25t).\n\nSimilarly, compute - (33\u221a14)/28 * y(t):\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 * [ \u221a14*(44 -125t)/33 ].\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe \u221a14 and 33 cancel with the denominator 33 and 28:\n\n= - ( (\u221a14 * \u221a14) /28 ) * (44 -125t )\n\nSince \u221a14 * \u221a14 =14,\n\n= - (14 /28)*(44 -125t ) = - (1/2)(44 -125t).\n\nTherefore, putting all terms together into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0,\n\nWe have:\n\n[ (52 -25t)^2 /36 + 14*(44 -125t)^2 / (33^2) ] + [ -3/2 (52 -25t) ] + [ -1/2 (44 -125t) ] =0.\n\nThis is quite complicated. Let me see if there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that point P lies on line AD and on the circumcircle, and A is already on both, so the line AD intersects the circle at A and P. The parametric equations can be used with t parameter, so the solutions for t will correspond to t=0 (point A) and t = t_p (point P). The product of the roots of the equation in terms of t should give us the value for t_p.\n\nAlternatively, using the parametric line equation and substituting into the circle equation, we can set up a quadratic equation in t, where one root is t=0 (since A is on the line and the circle), so the other root will give the parameter for point P. The product of the roots is c/a, so if we can write the equation as a quadratic in t, then the non-zero root can be found via that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using power of a point D with respect to the circle.\n\nRecall that Power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 (since D is external point with tangents DB and DC). Also, Power of D is equal to DA * DP, since line DA passes through D and intersects the circle at A and P. So:\n\nDB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nTherefore, DP = DB\u00b2 / DA.\n\nTherefore, AP = AD - DP, but wait, need to check the direction.\n\nWait, if D is outside the circle, then the line DA starts at D, goes through A (on the circle), and then extends to P? Wait no, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, then to P. Wait, but P is another intersection point. Since A is on the circle, and D is outside, then the line AD passes through A, goes to D, and then exits the circle again at P? Wait, no, because once you go from A through D (outside the circle), the other intersection would be beyond D, so P is on the extension beyond D. Wait, but then AP would be the distance from A to P, which is AD + DP. Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of signed lengths. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the power of point D: Power(D) = DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. So here, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. Since P is on the line beyond D from A, then DP = DA + AP? Wait, no. Wait, if A---D---P, then AP = AD + DP? Wait, no, AP would be the distance from A to P, which is AD + DP if D is between A and P. Wait, but if the line goes from A through D to P, then the order is A---D---P, so AP = AD + DP. But according to power of a point, Power(D) = DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but in Power of a Point, the formula is: for a point outside the circle, and a secant line through the point intersecting the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = Power(D). Here, the secant is DP and DA? Wait, perhaps the Power of a Point formula is:\n\nIf a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = Power(D). In our case, the line AD intersects the circle at A and P, so DA * DP = Power(D). But here, D is outside, so the two points are A and P, but since A is between D and P, then DA * DP = Power(D). Wait, actually, the formula is that if a secant from D passes through the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = Power(D). So in our case, if the line goes from D through A to P, then DA * DP = Power(D). But since A is between D and P, then DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, so DA * DP = Power(D). Wait, but Power(D) is equal to DB\u00b2. So DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Therefore, DP = DB\u00b2 / DA. Thus, AP = AD + DP ?\n\nWait, but AP is from A to P, which would be the length from A to D plus from D to P, so AP = AD + DP. Wait but DP is from D to P, so yes. So AP = AD + DP. Since DP = DB\u00b2 / DA,\n\nThus AP = AD + (DB\u00b2)/DA = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/DA.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider vector directions. Let me compute DA and DP as lengths.\n\nWait, let's think numerically. Let me compute DA first.\n\nCoordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 )\n\nCoordinates of A are (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 )\n\nCompute DA distance squared:\n\n\u0394x = (26/3 - 9/2) = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6,\n\n\u0394y = (4\u221a14/3 - (-27\u221a14/11 )) = (4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 ) = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11 ) = \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 ) = \u221a14*(125/33 )\n\nThus DA squared is (25/6)^2 + ( \u221a14*(125/33) )^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst term: (625)/36,\n\nSecond term: 14*(125/33)^2 =14*(15625 / 1089 ) = (218750)/1089.\n\nTherefore DA squared is 625/36 + 218750/1089.\n\nTo add these, common denominator is 36*1089. Let me compute:\n\n625/36 = (625 * 1089)/ (36*1089),\n\n218750/1089 = (218750 *36)/(36*1089).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst term: 625 *1089,\n\nSecond term:218750 *36.\n\nWait, this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps compute numerically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute DB squared first, since DB is the tangent length.\n\nDB squared is the power of D, which is equal to DA * DP, so if I can compute DB squared, then DP = DB\u00b2 / DA,\n\nThen AP = AD + DP = AD + (DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nTherefore, AP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD,\n\nSo maybe I can compute AD and DB squared separately.\n\nCompute DB squared: since D is at (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 ), and B is at (9,0).\n\nCompute \u0394x = 9 - 9/2 = 9/2,\n\n\u0394y = 0 - (-27\u221a14/11 ) =27\u221a14/11,\n\nThus DB squared is (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14 /11 )^2,\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst term:81/4,\n\nSecond term: (27^2)*(14)/(11\u00b2) = 729*14 / 121 = 10206 /121,\n\nThus DB squared is 81/4 + 10206/121,\n\nTo add these, common denominator 4*121=484,\n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484 = 9801/484,\n\n10206/121 = (10206*4)/484 = 40824/484,\n\nTotal DB squared = (9801 +40824)/484 =50625 /484,\n\nNotice that 50625 is 225\u00b2, and 484 is 22\u00b2. So DB squared = (225)^2 / (22)^2,\n\nTherefore DB = 225/22.\n\nWait, that's a nice simplification. So DB squared is (225/22)^2.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nWait 225 squared is 50625, yes,\n\n22 squared is 484, yes,\n\nSo DB squared is 50625/484.\n\nNow compute DA squared. Earlier we had:\n\nDA squared = (25/6)^2 + ( \u221a14*(125/33) )^2\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (25/6)^2 = 625/36,\n\nSecond term: (14)*(125/33)^2 =14*(15625/1089)= 218750/1089,\n\nSo DA squared is 625/36 +218750/1089.\n\nConvert to common denominator 36*1089= 39204,\n\n625/36 = (625 * 1089)/39204,\n\n218750/1089 = (218750 *36)/39204,\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst term:625 *1089,\n\nLet me compute 625 *1000 =625000, 625*89=55625, so total 625000 +55625= 680625,\n\nWait no, 1089 is 1000 +89,\n\nSo 625*(1000 +89)=625*1000 +625*89= 625000 + 55625=680,625.\n\nSecond term:218,750 *36,\n\n218,750 *36: 200,000*36=7,200,000,\n\n18,750*36= 675,000,\n\nTotal:7,200,000 +675,000=7,875,000.\n\nTherefore total numerator:\n\n680,625 +7,875,000 =8,555,625.\n\nThus DA squared =8,555,625 /39,204.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73 =2,851,875,\n\n39,204 \u00f73=13,068,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n2,851,875 \u00f73=950,625,\n\n13,068 \u00f73=4,356,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73=316,875,\n\n4,356 \u00f73=1,452,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1,452 \u00f73=484,\n\nNow 105,625 and 484. Let's see if they have common factors. 484 is 22\u00b2=4*121. 105625 divided by 5 is 21125, again 5, 21125/5=4225, etc. Let me see GCD(105625,484):\n\nPrime factors of 484: 2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2.\n\nPrime factors of 105625: 5^4 \u00d7 13\u00b2? Wait 105625 divided by 25 is 4225, which is 65\u00b2= (5\u00d713)^2, so 4225=5\u00b2\u00d713\u00b2. Thus 105625=25\u00d74225=25\u00d75\u00b2\u00d713\u00b2=5^4\u00d713\u00b2. So no common factors with 484 (which is 2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2). So the fraction reduces to 105625/484.\n\nWait let me check:\n\nWait 105625 /484. So DA squared is 105625/484,\n\nTherefore DA = sqrt(105625/484) = 325/22.\n\nWait, because 325 squared is 105,625 (since 300\u00b2=90,000, 25\u00b2=625, and cross terms 2*300*25=15,000, so (300+25)^2= 325\u00b2=105,625). And 22 squared is 484. So DA = 325/22.\n\nTherefore DA squared is (325/22)^2 =105,625 /484, which matches.\n\nSo now, we have DB squared = (225/22)^2,\n\nDA = 325/22,\n\nThus DP = DB\u00b2 / DA = (225/22)^2 / (325/22) ) = (225^2)/(22^2) * (22/325) )= (225^2)/(22*325).\n\nSimplify:\n\n225 and 325 have a common factor of 25:\n\n225 =25*9,\n\n325=25*13,\n\nThus:\n\n225^2 / (22*325) = (25\u00b2 *9\u00b2)/(22*25*13) )= (25*81)/(22*13)= (2025)/(286).\n\nSimplify 2025/286:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(2025,286). Let's see:\n\n286 divides into 2025 how many times? 286*7=2002, remainder 23.\n\nThen GCD(286,23). 286 \u00f723=12*23=276, remainder 10,\n\nGCD(23,10). 23 \u00f710=2 rem 3,\n\nGCD(10,3)=1. So GCD is 1. So 2025/286 is reduced.\n\nWait but 2025 divided by 11? 286 is 11*26. Let me check 2025 \u00f711: 11*184=2024, so remainder 1. Not divisible. So yes, fraction is reduced.\n\nThus DP =2025/286.\n\nTherefore AP = AD + DP = (325/22) + (2025/286).\n\nTo add these, common denominator is 286 (since 22*13=286):\n\n325/22 = (325*13)/286 = 4225/286,\n\nThus AP =4225/286 +2025/286 = (4225+2025)/286 =6250/286.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 3125/143.\n\nCheck if 3125 and 143 have common factors. 143=11*13. 3125 is 5^5. No common factors. So AP=3125/143.\n\nTherefore m=3125, n=143. Check if they are coprime. 143 factors into 11 and 13. 3125 divided by 11: 11*284=3124, so no. Divided by 13: 13*240=3120, remainder 5. So yes, coprime.\n\nThus m + n = 3125 +143 = 3268.\n\nWait, but wait, hold on. Let me double-check my steps because this seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nFirst, let me confirm DA squared was 105625/484, so DA is 325/22. That's correct because 325 squared is 105,625 and 22 squared is 484.\n\nDB squared is (225/22)^2, so DB is 225/22. Then DP is DB squared divided by DA, so (225/22)^2 divided by (325/22) = (225^2)/(22^2) * (22/325) = (225^2)/(22*325).\n\n225 squared is 50625, so 50625 divided by (22*325).\n\n22*325: 22*300=6600, 22*25=550, so total 7150.\n\nThus 50625 /7150. Let me compute that:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 50625/25=2025, 7150/25=286. So yes, 2025/286, so DP is 2025/286.\n\nThen AP is AD + DP = 325/22 + 2025/286.\n\nConvert 325/22 to denominator 286: 22*13=286, so multiply numerator and denominator by13: 325*13=4225, so 4225/286.\n\nAdding to 2025/286 gives (4225+2025)=6250 over 286. Then 6250/286 simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 3125/143. Since 143 is 11\u00d713, and 3125 is 5^5, no common factors. So AP=3125/143, so m + n=3125+143=3268.\n\nHmm, but that seems like a large answer. Let me see if there's an error in the Power of a Point approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the direction of the segments. The Power of a Point says that for a point D outside the circle, and a secant D-P-A (so D to P to A, with P and A on the circle), then DP * DA = Power(D). Wait, no, the formula is that if a secant from D passes through the circle at X and Y, with order D-X-Y, then DX * DY = Power(D). So in our case, the line goes from D to A to P (since A is on the circle between D and P?), so the points are D---A---P? Wait, no. Wait, point A is on the circle, so if D is outside, and the line DA goes from D to A (on the circle), then extending beyond A would go inside the circle, but the other intersection P must be on the other side. Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify the positions again.\n\nPoint D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, so it's outside the circle. The line AD starts at A (on the circle) and goes through D (outside). Therefore, the other intersection point P must be on the extension beyond D, so the order is A---D---P. Therefore, the secant is ADP with D between A and P. Therefore, the Power of a Point formula would be DA * DP = Power(D). Here DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. Wait, but if the points are A---D---P, then DA is from D to A (distance DA), and DP is from D to P (distance DP = DA + AP). Wait, no, if the order is A---D---P, then AP is AD + DP. Wait, but in terms of segments:\n\nAP = AD + DP,\n\nbut in terms of lengths,\n\nDA is the length from D to A,\n\nDP is the length from D to P,\n\nso DA * DP = (distance from D to A) * (distance from D to P) = Power(D).\n\nBut AP is the distance from A to P, which is equal to DP - DA, if D is between A and P? Wait no, if it's A---D---P, then AP = AD + DP,\n\nWait, no, AP is from A to P, so if D is between A and P, then AP = AD + DP,\n\nBut DA is the distance from D to A, which is the same as AD,\n\nand DP is the distance from D to P,\n\nSo DA * DP = AD * DP,\n\nBut AP = AD + DP,\n\nSo we can write DP = AP - AD,\n\nTherefore,\n\nAD*(AP - AD) = Power(D),\n\nSo AD*AP - AD\u00b2 = DB\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nAD*AP = AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD,\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo that formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, AP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD,\n\nWe had AD =325/22,\n\nDB\u00b2 = (225/22)^2,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = [ (325/22)^2 + (225/22)^2 ] / (325/22 )\n\nFactor out (1/22)^2,\n\n= [ (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2 ) / (22\u00b2) ] / (325/22 )\n\n= [ (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2 ) / (22\u00b2) ] * (22/325 )\n\n= (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2 ) / (22 *325 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n325\u00b2 = 105,625,\n\n225\u00b2 =50,625,\n\nTotal numerator: 105,625 +50,625 =156,250.\n\nThus AP =156,250/(22*325).\n\nSimplify denominator:22*325= 22*(300 +25)=6,600 +550=7,150.\n\nSo AP=156,250 /7,150.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 50:156,250 \u00f750=3,125; 7,150 \u00f750=143.\n\nThus AP=3125/143, so that's correct.\n\nThus m +n is 3125+143= 3268.\n\nHmm, but I feel like this might be the correct answer, but the problem states \"AP can be written as the form m/n where m and n are coprime integers\". 3125 and 143 are coprime since 143 factors into 11 and13, and 3125 is 5^5, so yes, so 3268 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in calculation steps. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates to compute AP.\n\nWe can parametrize line AD, find the other intersection point P, then compute the distance from A to P.\n\nWe had parametrized line AD as:\n\nx(t) =26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t)=4\u221a14/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t,\n\nWe can substitute into the circle equation and solve for t.\n\nThe circle equation was x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nWe can plug in x(t) and y(t):\n\nLet me denote t as the parameter. We can set up the equation and solve for t.

Therefore, there must be an error in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the parametrization's t_p=88/169,\n\nWait, AP would be the distance from A to P, which is the length from A to P along the line. Since the parameter t= t_p gives the position of P relative to A,\n\nIf the parametrization is x(t)=x_A + t*(x_D -x_A),\n\nthen the distance from A to P is |t_p| * |vector AD|,\n\nSince the vector from A to D has length AD,\n\nThus AP= |t_p| * AD,\n\nBut in the parametrization, when t=1, the distance from A is AD,\n\nThus, for t_p=88/169,\n\nAP= (88/169)*(325/22)= (88\u00d7325)/(169\u00d722).\n\nCompute numerator:88\u00d7325,\n\n88\u00d7300=26,400,\n\n88\u00d725=2,200,\n\nTotal:28,600,\n\nDenominator:169\u00d722=3,718,\n\nThus AP=28,600/3,718,\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2:14,300/1,859,\n\nCheck if 1,859 divides into numerator:\n\n1,859 \u00d77=13,013,\n\n14,300-13,013=1,287,\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, but 169 is 13\u00b2,\n\n22=2\u00d711,\n\n325=25\u00d713,\n\nSo,\n\nAP= (88\u00d7325)/(169\u00d722)= ( (88/22) \u00d7 (325/169) )=4 \u00d7 (25/13)=100/13\u22487.69,\n\nWhich is different from the Power of a Point result.\n\nThis discrepancy indicates an error in one of the methods.

So when t=1, we reach D,\n\nBut in the calculation of the quadratic equation, we found t_p=88/169\u22480.52,\n\nBut according to Power of a Point, the other intersection P should be beyond D, so t_p should be greater than 1,\n\nThus, the error is likely in the sign during the equation setup.\n\nLet me re-express the quadratic equation.\n\nThe quadratic equation was set up as:\n\nA t\u00b2 + B t =0,\n\nWith solutions t=0 and t= -B/A,\n\nBut if the other solution is beyond D (t>1), then -B/A must be greater than1,\n\nBut in my calculation, it was 88/169\u22480.52 <1,\n\nThis suggests that perhaps there was an error in the sign when expanding terms.\n\nLet me re-express the Power of a Point formula:\n\nPower(D)=DB\u00b2=DA * DP,\n\nWhere DA is the length from D to A,\n\nDP is the length from D to P,\n\nThus, if P is beyond D from A, then DP=DA + AP,\n\nWait no, if the points are A---D---P,\n\nThen DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P,\n\nAP is the distance from A to P,\n\nSo AP=AD + DP,\n\nBut DA=AD,\n\nThus, AP= DA + DP,\n\nPower of a Point gives DB\u00b2=DA * DP,\n\nThus,\n\nDP=DB\u00b2/DA,\n\nThus AP= DA + DB\u00b2/DA,\n\nWhich is what we had,\n\nBut according to parametrization,\n\nAP= t_p * AD,\n\nBut if t_p is the parameter beyond D,\n\nWait, the parameter t in the parametrization was defined as:\n\nx(t)=x_A + t*(x_D -x_A),\n\nThus when t=1, it's at D,\n\nTo go beyond D, need t>1,\n\nThus, the solution t_p must be greater than1,\n\nBut in our calculation, it was less than1,\n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the sign of the equation setup.\n\nLet me re-express the equation:\n\nWhen substituting into the circle equation,\n\nWe had:\n\n[x(t)]\u00b2 + [y(t)]\u00b2 -9x(t) - (33\u221a14)/28 y(t) =0,\n\nBut perhaps I missed a negative sign somewhere.\n\nLet me recheck the term - (33\u221a14)/28 y(t).\n\nPreviously I computed this term as:\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 * y(t)= -22 +62.5t,\n\nBut let me recompute:\n\ny(t)= (4\u221a14/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t),\n\nThus,\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 * y(t)= - (33\u221a14)/28*(4\u221a14/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t )\n\n= - (33\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(28*3) + (33\u221a14 *125\u221a14 t)/(28*33)\n\n= - (33*4*14)/(28*3) + (125*14 t)/(28 )\n\nFirst term:\n\n33/3=11,\n\nThus,\n\n- (11*4*14)/28,\n\n4*14=56,\n\n11*56=616,\n\n616/28=22,\n\nThus first term is -22,\n\nSecond term:\n\n125*14=1750,\n\n1750/28=62.5,\n\nThus second term is +62.5t,\n\nThus the term is indeed -22 +62.5t,\n\nTherefore that part is correct.\n\nThus the entire equation is correct.\n\nThen why does the quadratic solution give t_p=88/169?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the parametrization.\n\nWait, in the parametrization,\n\nx(t)=x_A +t*(x_D -x_A),\n\nThus increasing t moves from A towards D,\n\nSo the other intersection P is on the opposite side of A from D,\n\nWait, but that can\u2019t be because D is outside the circle, so the line AD should exit the circle at P beyond D.\n\nWait, maybe the parametrization is set up such that t=0 is at A, and t=1 is at D,\n\nBut the other intersection P is actually on the other side of A, not going through D.\n\nWait, that would mean that the line AD intersects the circle again at P on the other side of A,\n\nBut geometrically, since D is outside the circle, the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes outward to D, and then continues past D to another point P on the circle? That would require the circle to be on both sides of AD, but since it's a triangle inscribed in the circle, the line AD can\u2019t intersect the circle again beyond D unless the circle is very large, but in our coordinates, let's see.\n\nCoordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11),\n\nCoordinates of A are (26/3, 4\u221a14/3),\n\nThe line from A to D goes from A (positive y) to D (negative y), so it's going downward,\n\nThe circle passes through A,B,C,\n\nPoint B is at (9,0),\n\nPoint C is at (0,0),\n\nThe center O is at (9/2, 33\u221a14/56),\n\nSo the circle's center is at (4.5, approx 33*3.7417/56\u2248 (4.5, approx 2.19).\n\nThus the center is near (4.5, 2.19),\n\nThe point D is at (4.5, -27\u221a14/11\u2248 -27*3.7417/11\u2248-9.15).\n\nSo the line AD goes from A (8.666, 4\u221a14/3\u2248 6.532) to D (4.5, -9.15),\n\nThis line would exit the circle again on the other side from D?\n\nWait, perhaps the parametrization is correct, and the other intersection is between A and D?\n\nBut according to the Power of a Point, the Power is DB\u00b2= (225/22)^2\u2248 (10.227)^2\u2248104.6,\n\nDA is 325/22\u224814.77,\n\nThus DA * DP =104.6,\n\nThus DP\u2248104.6 /14.77\u22487.08,\n\nThus AP=AD + DP\u224814.77+7.08\u224821.85,\n\nWhich matches the Power of a Point result.\n\nBut according to the parametrization, AP= t_p * AD\u22480.52*14.77\u22487.69,\n\nBut this is DP, the distance from D to P,\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the parametrization,\n\nIf t_p=88/169\u22480.52,\n\nThen P is located between A and D,\n\nThus the distance from A to P is t_p * AD\u22480.52*14.77\u22487.69,\n\nBut according to Power of a Point,\n\nAP should be AD + DP,\n\nWhere DP=DB\u00b2/DA\u22487.08,\n\nThus AD + DP\u224814.77+7.08\u224821.85,\n\nSo there's inconsistency.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I misunderstood the parametrization's direction.\n\nWait, in the parametrization,\n\nx(t)=x_A +t*(x_D -x_A),\n\nThus when t=0, we are at A,\n\nWhen t=1, at D,\n\nWhen t=2, beyond D,\n\nThus, to reach P beyond D, we need t_p>1,\n\nBut according to the quadratic solution,\n\nt_p=88/169\u22480.52,\n\nWhich is between A and D,\n\nThus this suggests that the other intersection is between A and D,\n\nBut according to the Power of a Point, since D is outside, the secant should intersect the circle at two points: one is A, and the other should be on the other side of D,\n\nBut in this case, the calculation shows that the other intersection is between A and D,\n\nThis suggests that the Power of a Point was applied incorrectly.\n\nWait, Power of a Point formula: for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to each intersection point on a secant line.\n\nThus, if the secant line passes through D, goes through the circle at P and A,\n\nThen the power is DP * DA =DB\u00b2,\n\nWait, but if P is between A and D, then DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P,\n\nThus DA * DP=DB\u00b2,\n\nBut then AP=DA - DP,\n\nThus AP= DA - (DB\u00b2/DA),\n\nWhich would give AP= (DA\u00b2 -DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nWhich is different from before,\n\nBut this contradicts my previous understanding.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nLet me denote the two intersection points of line DA with the circle as A and P,\n\nWith D outside,\n\nThe points are ordered: D---P---A,\n\nThus, the distances are:\n\nDP is from D to P,\n\nPA is from P to A,\n\nThus the Power of a Point formula states DP * DA=DB\u00b2,\n\nWait, DA is the entire length from D to A,\n\nDP is from D to P,\n\nThus DA = DP + PA,\n\nThus,\n\nDP*(DP + PA)=DB\u00b2,\n\nBut this seems different.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is:\n\nIf a secant from D passes through the circle at X and Y,\n\nthen DX * DY=Power(D),\n\nwhere DX and DY are the distances from D to each intersection point,\n\nin order D---X---Y or D---Y---X,\n\nThus, if the points are D---P---A,\n\nthen DP * DA=DB\u00b2,\n\nBecause DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nand DP is from D to P,\n\nThus,\n\nDP * DA=DB\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nAP= PA= DA - DP,\n\nThus,\n\nAP= DA - (DB\u00b2/DA),\n\nThus,\n\nAP= (DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nWhich would be,\n\nAP= ( (325/22)^2 - (225/22)^2 ) / (325/22),\n\n= ( (325\u00b2 -225\u00b2)/22\u00b2 ) / (325/22),\n\n= ( (325 -225)(325 +225)/22\u00b2 ) * (22/325 ),\n\n= (100 *550 / (22\u00b2 )) * (22/325),\n\n= (55,000 /484) * (22/325),\n\n= (55,000 *22 ) / (484 *325),\n\nSimplify:\n\n55,000 /325=169.23,\n\nBut let me compute numerator and denominator:\n\n55,000 *22 = 1,210,000,\n\n484 *325=157,300,\n\nThus,\n\nAP=1,210,000 /157,300,\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100:12,100/1,573,\n\nCheck GCD(12100,1573):\n\n1573 \u00f712100?

I incorrectly assumed the points were ordered A---D---P, but they are actually D---P---A, so the Power of a Point formula gives DP * DA=DB\u00b2,\n\nHence AP= DA - DP= DA - (DB\u00b2/DA)= (DA\u00b2 -DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nThus AP= ( (325/22)^2 - (225/22)^2 )/(325/22)= ( (325^2 -225^2)/22^2 )/(325/22)= ( (325-225)(325+225)/22^2 )*(22/325)= (100*550 / (22^2)) * (22/325)= (55,000 / 484)*(22/325)= (55,000*22)/(484*325)=1,210,000/157,300=12100/1573=100/13,\n\nSo AP=100/13,\n\nThus the correct answer is 100/13, so m=100, n=13, which are coprime, so m+n=113.\n\nThis aligns with the parametrization result.\n\nSo my initial mistake was in the Power of a Point setup, assuming the point P was beyond D, but actually it's between D and A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 100 +13=113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the length of AP in triangle ABC inscribed in a circle \u03c9. The tangents at B and C meet at point D, and AD intersects the circle again at P.

Anyway, perhaps I can use some properties related to pole and polar lines here.\n\nAlternatively, since D lies on the tangents at B and C, then DB = DC because the lengths from D to the points of tangency are equal. Wait, actually, the lengths from D to B and C are not necessarily equal, but the lengths of the tangents from D to the circle are equal. Since D is on the tangent at B, the tangent from D to \u03c9 at B, so the length DB is equal to the length of the tangent from D to \u03c9. Similarly, DC is also the tangent length from D to \u03c9. Wait, so actually DB = DC? Because both are tangent segments from D to the circle. Oh yes, that's right! The two tangent segments from a single external point to a circle are equal in length. Therefore, DB = DC. So triangle DBC is isoceles with DB=DC. Hmm, that might be useful.\n\nNow, perhaps I can use power of a point. The Power of a Point theorem states that for a point D outside a circle, the square of the tangent length is equal to the product of the lengths of the segments from D to the points of intersection with the circle along any secant line. So for point D, since DA is a secant that goes through A and P, then we have DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. Since DB is the tangent, so DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. That seems useful.\n\nSo if I can compute DB\u00b2 and DA, then I can find DP, and since AP = AD - DP? Wait, no, AP is from A to P, but AD is from A to D, so actually, AP is part of AD. Wait, AD is a secant that starts at A, goes through D, and then meets the circle again at P. Wait, actually, hold on: the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then intersects the circle again at P. Wait, but if D is outside the circle, then AD would start at A (on the circle), go through D (outside), and then P is another intersection point? Wait, but A is already on the circle, so when AD is extended beyond D, it meets the circle again at P? Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Let the tangents to \u03c9 at B and C intersect at point D, and let AD intersect \u03c9 at P.\" So AD starts at A, goes through D, and intersects \u03c9 again at P. So starting from A, going through D, and then hitting the circle again at P. Therefore, the order is A---P---D along the line AD. Wait, but if D is outside the circle, then starting from A (on the circle), going through D (outside), so the other intersection point would be beyond D? Wait, that would mean that AP is from A to P, but if P is between A and D, then AP would be shorter than AD. Alternatively, maybe the line AD is extended beyond A to meet the circle again? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify the diagram.\n\nLooking at the Asymptote code, they have:\n\ndraw(A--B--C--cycle);\n\ndraw(A..B..C..cycle, red+dotted); which is the circumcircle.\n\nThen O is the circumcenter.\n\nThen E and F are rotations of O by 90 degrees? Wait, maybe not. The code says E = rotate(90,B) * (O); which might be rotating point O 90 degrees around B, but that might be for drawing the tangent lines? Hmm, perhaps the tangent at B is perpendicular to the radius OB, so the tangent line at B is perpendicular to OB. So to draw the tangent line at B, they might be constructing a line perpendicular to OB at point B. Similarly for the tangent at C.\n\nThen D is the intersection point of the two tangents at B and C. So D is outside the circle, as tangents from an external point.\n\nThen AD is drawn, and P is the intersection of AD with the circle again. Since A is already on the circle, so the line AD starts at A, goes through D, and then exits the circle again at P? Wait, that can't be because if D is outside the circle, then going from A through D would go outward, so P would be the second intersection point, meaning that AP is from A through D to P, but then AP would be longer than AD. Wait, perhaps the Asymptote code says:\n\nP = IP(D..A, A..B..C); which might mean the intersection of line DA with the circle, other than A. So P is the second point of intersection, so the order is A---P---D? Wait, but if you go from D towards A, then the first intersection with the circle is P, then A. So AP would be from A to P, but since A is on the circle, P is another point, so AP is a chord passing through D. Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think in terms of coordinates or use some theorem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use harmonic division or projective geometry? Hmm, maybe inversion?\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates. Let me try coordinate geometry. Let me place the triangle in coordinate plane. Maybe set point C at the origin to simplify. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nLet me set point C at (0,0). Let me set point B at (9, 0), but wait, BC is 9, but AC is 10, AB is 5. Wait, maybe coordinate system setup needs to be done carefully.\n\nAlternatively, let me place point C at (0,0), point B at (x, 0), and point A somewhere in the plane. Let me try.\n\nLet me denote coordinates:\n\nLet me let point C be at (0,0), point B at (b, 0), and point A somewhere in the plane. Then AC = 10, BC =9, so since BC is from (0,0) to (b,0), so BC length is |b| = 9, so b=9. So point B is at (9,0). Then point A is somewhere such that AB=5 and AC=10. So coordinates of A must satisfy distance from A to C (0,0) is 10, and distance from A to B (9,0) is 5. Let me find coordinates of A.\n\nLet me let coordinates of A be (x,y). Then:\n\nFrom AC =10: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 100,\n\nFrom AB=5: (x -9)^2 + y\u00b2 = 25.\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - [(x -9)^2 + y\u00b2] = 100 -25,\n\nExpand: x\u00b2 - (x\u00b2 -18x +81) =75,\n\nSimplify: 18x -81 =75,\n\n18x = 156,\n\nx = 156 / 18 = 26/3 \u2248 8.666...\n\nThen substitute back to find y:\n\nx = 26/3, so x\u00b2 = (676)/9,\n\nThen y\u00b2 = 100 - (676/9) = (900 - 676)/9 = 224/9,\n\nThus y = \u00b1\u221a(224/9) = \u00b1(\u221a224)/3 = \u00b1(4\u221a14)/3.\n\nHmm, so coordinates of A are (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3) or (26/3, -4\u221a14/3). Since the triangle is drawn with the Asymptote code showing point A at (10,0), but in the code's coordinate system, but in my setup, maybe it's in a different orientation. Let me pick the positive y-coordinate for A, so (26/3, 4\u221a14/3).\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nC: (0,0)\n\nB: (9,0)\n\nA: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3 )\n\nNow, need to find the circumcircle \u03c9 of triangle ABC. Let me compute the circumradius or the equation of the circumcircle.\n\nAlternatively, since I have coordinates for A, B, C, I can find the equation of the circle passing through these three points.\n\nLet me denote the general equation of a circle as:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0.\n\nPlugging in point C (0,0):\n\n0 +0 +0 +0 + F =0 \u21d2 F=0.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey =0.\n\nNow plug in point B (9,0):\n\n9\u00b2 +0 + 9D +0 =0 \u21d281 +9D =0 \u21d2 D = -81/9 = -9.\n\nSo equation now is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x + Ey =0.\n\nNow plug in point A (26/3, 4\u221a14/3):\n\n( (26/3)^2 + (4\u221a14/3)^2 ) -9*(26/3) + E*(4\u221a14/3) =0\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (26/3)^2 = (676)/9,\n\n(4\u221a14 /3)^2 = 16*14 /9 = 224/9,\n\nTotal first part: (676 +224)/9 = 900/9 =100.\n\nSecond term: -9*(26/3) = -78.\n\nThird term: E*(4\u221a14 /3).\n\nSo putting together:\n\n100 -78 + (4\u221a14 /3) E =0 \u21d222 + (4\u221a14 /3) E =0 \u21d2 (4\u221a14 /3) E = -22 \u21d2 E = (-22 *3)/(4\u221a14) = (-66)/(4\u221a14) = (-33)/(2\u221a14).\n\nRationalizing denominator:\n\nE = (-33)/(2\u221a14) * (\u221a14/\u221a14) = (-33\u221a14)/(28).\n\nTherefore the equation of the circle is:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nHmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way? Alternatively, perhaps compute the circumradius using the formula:\n\nR = (a b c)/(4\u0394), where a,b,c are sides, and \u0394 is area.\n\nGiven triangle ABC with sides AB=5, BC=9, AC=10.\n\nWait, sides: AB=5, BC=9, AC=10. Let me confirm the sides:\n\nAB=5, BC=9, AC=10. So sides a, b, c opposite to angles A,B,C respectively? Wait, standard notation is a opposite A, but maybe better to note:\n\nLet me denote sides as:\n\na = BC =9,\n\nb = AC=10,\n\nc = AB=5.\n\nThen the semiperimeter s = (a + b +c)/2 = (9+10+5)/2=24/2=12.\n\nArea \u0394 can be computed via Heron's formula:\n\n\u0394 = \u221a[s(s -a)(s -b)(s -c)] = \u221a[12(12-9)(12-10)(12-5)] = \u221a[12*3*2*7] = \u221a[504] = \u221a[16*31.5] Wait, 504=16*31.5? Wait, 12*3=36, 36*2=72, 72*7=504. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(16*31.5)= but 504= 16*31.5 is not exact. Wait, 504 divided by 16 is 31.5, but perhaps factor into primes:\n\n504= 2^3 * 3^2 *7. So sqrt(504)=sqrt(2^3 *3^2 *7)= 2^(1.5)*3*sqrt(7)= 2*sqrt(2)*3*sqrt(7)= 6*sqrt(14). Wait:\n\nWait, 2^3 is 8, 3^2 is 9, so 8*9*7=504. Then sqrt(504)=sqrt(8*9*7)=sqrt(8)*sqrt(9)*sqrt(7)= 2\u221a2 *3*\u221a7=6\u221a14. Yes, that's correct. So area is 6\u221a14.\n\nTherefore, the circumradius R = (a b c)/(4\u0394) = (9 *10 *5)/(4*6\u221a14) = (450)/(24\u221a14) = (75)/(4\u221a14). Rationalizing denominator:\n\n75/(4\u221a14) * \u221a14/\u221a14 = (75\u221a14)/(4*14) = (75\u221a14)/56. So R = 75\u221a14 /56.\n\nHmm, okay. Not sure if this will be helpful yet, but maybe useful later.\n\nNow, going back to the problem. We need to find point D, which is the intersection of the tangents at B and C to the circumcircle.\n\nThe tangent at B: since the circle has equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0, the tangent at point B (9,0).\n\nThe equation of the tangent at point (x1,y1) on the circle x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey +F =0 is:\n\nx x1 + y y1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0 ?\n\nWait, maybe better to recall the formula for tangent at (x1,y1) is:\n\nxx1 + yy1 + D*(x + x1)/2 + E*(y + y1)/2 + F =0 ?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using derivative? Alternatively, since the tangent at point B is perpendicular to the radius OB, where O is the center of the circle.\n\nWait, maybe it's easier to compute the center of the circle first.\n\nGiven the equation of the circle: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0,\n\nThe general equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + Dx + Ey + F =0, so center is (-D/2, -E/2).\n\nThus, center O has coordinates:\n\nx-coordinate: -(-9)/2 = 9/2,\n\ny-coordinate: -[ - (33\u221a14)/28 ] /2 = (33\u221a14)/56.\n\nSo O is at (9/2, 33\u221a14 /56).\n\nTherefore, the radius vector from O to B (9,0) is (9 - 9/2, 0 - 33\u221a14 /56 ) = (9/2, -33\u221a14 /56 ).\n\nTherefore, the tangent at B is perpendicular to this radius. So the direction vector of the radius is (9/2, -33\u221a14 /56 ), so the tangent line at B will have a direction perpendicular to that. The slope of the radius is (\u0394y)/(\u0394x) = [ -33\u221a14 /56 ] / (9/2 ) = [ -33\u221a14 /56 ] * [2/9] = (-66\u221a14)/(504) = (-11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the radius is m_r = (-11\u221a14)/84, so the slope of the tangent line is the negative reciprocal, which is m_t = 84/(11\u221a14).\n\nSimplify m_t: 84/(11\u221a14) can be rationalized as 84\u221a14/(11*14) = 6\u221a14/11. Because 84 divided by 14 is 6. So m_t = (6\u221a14)/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent line at B has slope (6\u221a14)/11 and passes through point B (9,0). So its equation is:\n\ny -0 = (6\u221a14 /11)(x -9).\n\nSimilarly, let's compute the tangent at point C (0,0). Wait, point C is (0,0). The tangent at C: the radius from O to C is the vector from O (9/2, 33\u221a14 /56) to C (0,0), which is (-9/2, -33\u221a14 /56 ). The slope of the radius is [ -33\u221a14 /56 ] / (-9/2 ) = (33\u221a14 /56 ) / (9/2 ) = (33\u221a14)/56 * 2/9 = (66\u221a14)/(504) = (11\u221a14)/84.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent line at C is the negative reciprocal of that, so m_t = -84/(11\u221a14). Rationalizing similarly:\n\n-84/(11\u221a14) = -84\u221a14/(11*14) = -6\u221a14/11.\n\nTherefore, the tangent at C (0,0) has slope -6\u221a14/11, so its equation is:\n\ny -0 = (-6\u221a14 /11)(x -0) \u2192 y = (-6\u221a14 /11)x.\n\nSo now we have equations for both tangents:\n\nTangent at B: y = (6\u221a14/11)(x -9)\n\nTangent at C: y = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nFind their intersection point D. Set the two equations equal:\n\n(6\u221a14/11)(x -9) = (-6\u221a14/11)x\n\nMultiply both sides by 11/(6\u221a14) to eliminate coefficients:\n\n(x -9) = -x\n\nSo x -9 = -x \u2192 2x =9 \u2192 x= 9/2.\n\nThen plug back into tangent at C's equation:\n\ny = (-6\u221a14/11)(9/2) = (-54\u221a14)/(22) = (-27\u221a14)/11.\n\nThus, point D has coordinates (9/2, -27\u221a14/11).\n\nHmm, okay. Now, need to find point P, which is the second intersection of line AD with the circumcircle. Since A is (26/3, 4\u221a14/3), and D is (9/2, -27\u221a14/11). Let me parametrize line AD.\n\nFirst, let me write coordinates for points A and D:\n\nA: (26/3, (4\u221a14)/3 )\n\nD: (9/2, -27\u221a14 /11 )\n\nLet me write the parametric equations for line AD. Let parameter t go from 0 to 1 for points from A to D, but since we need the extension beyond D to find P, maybe parameter t will go beyond 1.\n\nParametric equations:\n\nx(t) = x_A + t*(x_D - x_A)\n\ny(t) = y_A + t*(y_D - y_A)\n\nCompute the differences:\n\n\u0394x = x_D - x_A = (9/2 - 26/3) = (27/6 -52/6)= (-25/6)\n\n\u0394y = y_D - y_A = (-27\u221a14/11 - 4\u221a14/3 ) = \u221a14*(-27/11 -4/3 ) = \u221a14*(-81/33 -44/33)= \u221a14*(-125/33)\n\nSo parametric equations:\n\nx(t) = 26/3 + t*(-25/6 )\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 + t*(-125\u221a14/33 )\n\nWe need to find the point P \u2260 A on the circumcircle along this line. Since A is already on the circle, the other intersection P corresponds to the other solution of the parametric equations when substituted into the circle's equation.\n\nLet me substitute x(t) and y(t) into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nThis might get very algebra-heavy, but let's proceed step by step.\n\nFirst, let me denote:\n\nLet me write x(t) = 26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t) = (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t.\n\nLet me compute x(t)^2:\n\n[26/3 - (25/6)t]^2 = (26/3)^2 - 2*(26/3)*(25/6)t + (25/6 t)^2\n\nSimilarly, y(t)^2:\n\n[ (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t ]^2 = (4\u221a14/3)^2 - 2*(4\u221a14/3)*(125\u221a14/33)t + (125\u221a14/33 t)^2\n\nThis is going to be very tedious, but perhaps there's a smarter way. Since we know that when t=0, we are at point A, which is on the circle, so the equation will be satisfied. The other solution corresponds to t value where P is located. Let me denote t=1 corresponds to point D. Wait, but D is outside the circle, so P is beyond D? Since when t=1, we are at D, so perhaps t>1 to get to P?\n\nAlternatively, let me set up the equation and solve for t. Let me denote:\n\nLet me substitute x(t) and y(t) into the circle equation. Let me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst, compute x(t)^2 + y(t)^2:\n\nLet me compute x(t)^2:\n\nLet me write x(t) = (26/3) - (25/6)t. Let me write all terms over 6 to combine:\n\n= (52/6 -25/6 t) = (52 -25t)/6.\n\nTherefore, x(t)^2 = (52 -25t)^2 / 36.\n\nSimilarly, y(t) = [ (4\u221a14)/3 - (125\u221a14)/33 t ]\n\nLet me factor out \u221a14:\n\n= \u221a14 [4/3 - (125/33)t ]\n\nLet me write 4/3 as 44/33, so:\n\n= \u221a14 [44/33 - 125/33 t ] = \u221a14*(44 -125t)/33.\n\nTherefore, y(t)^2 = 14*(44 -125t)^2 / (33^2).\n\nSo, x(t)^2 + y(t)^2 = [ (52 -25t)^2 ] /36 + [14*(44 -125t)^2 ] / (33^2).\n\nNow compute -9x(t):\n\n-9*( (52 -25t)/6 ) = - (9/6)*(52 -25t) = - (3/2)(52 -25t).\n\nSimilarly, compute - (33\u221a14)/28 * y(t):\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 * [ \u221a14*(44 -125t)/33 ].\n\nSimplify:\n\nThe \u221a14 and 33 cancel with the denominator 33 and 28:\n\n= - ( (\u221a14 * \u221a14) /28 ) * (44 -125t )\n\nSince \u221a14 * \u221a14 =14,\n\n= - (14 /28)*(44 -125t ) = - (1/2)(44 -125t).\n\nTherefore, putting all terms together into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0,\n\nWe have:\n\n[ (52 -25t)^2 /36 + 14*(44 -125t)^2 / (33^2) ] + [ -3/2 (52 -25t) ] + [ -1/2 (44 -125t) ] =0.\n\nThis is quite complicated. Let me see if there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, since we know that point P lies on line AD and on the circumcircle, and A is already on both, so the line AD intersects the circle at A and P. The parametric equations can be used with t parameter, so the solutions for t will correspond to t=0 (point A) and t = t_p (point P). The product of the roots of the equation in terms of t should give us the value for t_p.\n\nAlternatively, using the parametric line equation and substituting into the circle equation, we can set up a quadratic equation in t, where one root is t=0 (since A is on the line and the circle), so the other root will give the parameter for point P. The product of the roots is c/a, so if we can write the equation as a quadratic in t, then the non-zero root can be found via that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using power of a point D with respect to the circle.\n\nRecall that Power of D with respect to \u03c9 is equal to DB\u00b2 = DC\u00b2 (since D is external point with tangents DB and DC). Also, Power of D is equal to DA * DP, since line DA passes through D and intersects the circle at A and P. So:\n\nDB\u00b2 = DA * DP.\n\nTherefore, DP = DB\u00b2 / DA.\n\nTherefore, AP = AD - DP, but wait, need to check the direction.\n\nWait, if D is outside the circle, then the line DA starts at D, goes through A (on the circle), and then extends to P? Wait no, the line AD starts at A, goes through D, then to P. Wait, but P is another intersection point. Since A is on the circle, and D is outside, then the line AD passes through A, goes to D, and then exits the circle again at P? Wait, no, because once you go from A through D (outside the circle), the other intersection would be beyond D, so P is on the extension beyond D. Wait, but then AP would be the distance from A to P, which is AD + DP. Wait, perhaps I need to think in terms of signed lengths. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider the power of point D: Power(D) = DB\u00b2 = DA * DP. So here, DA is the length from D to A, and DP is from D to P. Since P is on the line beyond D from A, then DP = DA + AP? Wait, no. Wait, if A---D---P, then AP = AD + DP? Wait, no, AP would be the distance from A to P, which is AD + DP if D is between A and P. Wait, but if the line goes from A through D to P, then the order is A---D---P, so AP = AD + DP. But according to power of a point, Power(D) = DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Wait, but in Power of a Point, the formula is: for a point outside the circle, and a secant line through the point intersecting the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = Power(D). Here, the secant is DP and DA? Wait, perhaps the Power of a Point formula is:\n\nIf a line through D intersects the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = Power(D). In our case, the line AD intersects the circle at A and P, so DA * DP = Power(D). But here, D is outside, so the two points are A and P, but since A is between D and P, then DA * DP = Power(D). Wait, actually, the formula is that if a secant from D passes through the circle at X and Y, then DX * DY = Power(D). So in our case, if the line goes from D through A to P, then DA * DP = Power(D). But since A is between D and P, then DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P, so DA * DP = Power(D). Wait, but Power(D) is equal to DB\u00b2. So DA * DP = DB\u00b2. Therefore, DP = DB\u00b2 / DA. Thus, AP = AD + DP ?\n\nWait, but AP is from A to P, which would be the length from A to D plus from D to P, so AP = AD + DP. Wait but DP is from D to P, so yes. So AP = AD + DP. Since DP = DB\u00b2 / DA,\n\nThus AP = AD + (DB\u00b2)/DA = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/DA.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider vector directions. Let me compute DA and DP as lengths.\n\nWait, let's think numerically. Let me compute DA first.\n\nCoordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 )\n\nCoordinates of A are (26/3, 4\u221a14/3 )\n\nCompute DA distance squared:\n\n\u0394x = (26/3 - 9/2) = (52/6 -27/6)=25/6,\n\n\u0394y = (4\u221a14/3 - (-27\u221a14/11 )) = (4\u221a14/3 +27\u221a14/11 ) = \u221a14*(4/3 +27/11 ) = \u221a14*( (44 +81)/33 ) = \u221a14*(125/33 )\n\nThus DA squared is (25/6)^2 + ( \u221a14*(125/33) )^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\nFirst term: (625)/36,\n\nSecond term: 14*(125/33)^2 =14*(15625 / 1089 ) = (218750)/1089.\n\nTherefore DA squared is 625/36 + 218750/1089.\n\nTo add these, common denominator is 36*1089. Let me compute:\n\n625/36 = (625 * 1089)/ (36*1089),\n\n218750/1089 = (218750 *36)/(36*1089).\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst term: 625 *1089,\n\nSecond term:218750 *36.\n\nWait, this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps compute numerically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute DB squared first, since DB is the tangent length.\n\nDB squared is the power of D, which is equal to DA * DP, so if I can compute DB squared, then DP = DB\u00b2 / DA,\n\nThen AP = AD + DP = AD + (DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nTherefore, AP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD,\n\nSo maybe I can compute AD and DB squared separately.\n\nCompute DB squared: since D is at (9/2, -27\u221a14/11 ), and B is at (9,0).\n\nCompute \u0394x = 9 - 9/2 = 9/2,\n\n\u0394y = 0 - (-27\u221a14/11 ) =27\u221a14/11,\n\nThus DB squared is (9/2)^2 + (27\u221a14 /11 )^2,\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst term:81/4,\n\nSecond term: (27^2)*(14)/(11\u00b2) = 729*14 / 121 = 10206 /121,\n\nThus DB squared is 81/4 + 10206/121,\n\nTo add these, common denominator 4*121=484,\n\n81/4 = (81*121)/484 = 9801/484,\n\n10206/121 = (10206*4)/484 = 40824/484,\n\nTotal DB squared = (9801 +40824)/484 =50625 /484,\n\nNotice that 50625 is 225\u00b2, and 484 is 22\u00b2. So DB squared = (225)^2 / (22)^2,\n\nTherefore DB = 225/22.\n\nWait, that's a nice simplification. So DB squared is (225/22)^2.\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nWait 225 squared is 50625, yes,\n\n22 squared is 484, yes,\n\nSo DB squared is 50625/484.\n\nNow compute DA squared. Earlier we had:\n\nDA squared = (25/6)^2 + ( \u221a14*(125/33) )^2\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst term: (25/6)^2 = 625/36,\n\nSecond term: (14)*(125/33)^2 =14*(15625/1089)= 218750/1089,\n\nSo DA squared is 625/36 +218750/1089.\n\nConvert to common denominator 36*1089= 39204,\n\n625/36 = (625 * 1089)/39204,\n\n218750/1089 = (218750 *36)/39204,\n\nCompute numerator:\n\nFirst term:625 *1089,\n\nLet me compute 625 *1000 =625000, 625*89=55625, so total 625000 +55625= 680625,\n\nWait no, 1089 is 1000 +89,\n\nSo 625*(1000 +89)=625*1000 +625*89= 625000 + 55625=680,625.\n\nSecond term:218,750 *36,\n\n218,750 *36: 200,000*36=7,200,000,\n\n18,750*36= 675,000,\n\nTotal:7,200,000 +675,000=7,875,000.\n\nTherefore total numerator:\n\n680,625 +7,875,000 =8,555,625.\n\nThus DA squared =8,555,625 /39,204.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n8,555,625 \u00f73 =2,851,875,\n\n39,204 \u00f73=13,068,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n2,851,875 \u00f73=950,625,\n\n13,068 \u00f73=4,356,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n950,625 \u00f73=316,875,\n\n4,356 \u00f73=1,452,\n\nAgain divide by 3:\n\n316,875 \u00f73=105,625,\n\n1,452 \u00f73=484,\n\nNow 105,625 and 484. Let's see if they have common factors. 484 is 22\u00b2=4*121. 105625 divided by 5 is 21125, again 5, 21125/5=4225, etc. Let me see GCD(105625,484):\n\nPrime factors of 484: 2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2.\n\nPrime factors of 105625: 5^4 \u00d7 13\u00b2? Wait 105625 divided by 25 is 4225, which is 65\u00b2= (5\u00d713)^2, so 4225=5\u00b2\u00d713\u00b2. Thus 105625=25\u00d74225=25\u00d75\u00b2\u00d713\u00b2=5^4\u00d713\u00b2. So no common factors with 484 (which is 2\u00b2\u00d711\u00b2). So the fraction reduces to 105625/484.\n\nWait let me check:\n\nWait 105625 /484. So DA squared is 105625/484,\n\nTherefore DA = sqrt(105625/484) = 325/22.\n\nWait, because 325 squared is 105,625 (since 300\u00b2=90,000, 25\u00b2=625, and cross terms 2*300*25=15,000, so (300+25)^2= 325\u00b2=105,625). And 22 squared is 484. So DA = 325/22.\n\nTherefore DA squared is (325/22)^2 =105,625 /484, which matches.\n\nSo now, we have DB squared = (225/22)^2,\n\nDA = 325/22,\n\nThus DP = DB\u00b2 / DA = (225/22)^2 / (325/22) ) = (225^2)/(22^2) * (22/325) )= (225^2)/(22*325).\n\nSimplify:\n\n225 and 325 have a common factor of 25:\n\n225 =25*9,\n\n325=25*13,\n\nThus:\n\n225^2 / (22*325) = (25\u00b2 *9\u00b2)/(22*25*13) )= (25*81)/(22*13)= (2025)/(286).\n\nSimplify 2025/286:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by GCD(2025,286). Let's see:\n\n286 divides into 2025 how many times? 286*7=2002, remainder 23.\n\nThen GCD(286,23). 286 \u00f723=12*23=276, remainder 10,\n\nGCD(23,10). 23 \u00f710=2 rem 3,\n\nGCD(10,3)=1. So GCD is 1. So 2025/286 is reduced.\n\nWait but 2025 divided by 11? 286 is 11*26. Let me check 2025 \u00f711: 11*184=2024, so remainder 1. Not divisible. So yes, fraction is reduced.\n\nThus DP =2025/286.\n\nTherefore AP = AD + DP = (325/22) + (2025/286).\n\nTo add these, common denominator is 286 (since 22*13=286):\n\n325/22 = (325*13)/286 = 4225/286,\n\nThus AP =4225/286 +2025/286 = (4225+2025)/286 =6250/286.\n\nSimplify this fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2: 3125/143.\n\nCheck if 3125 and 143 have common factors. 143=11*13. 3125 is 5^5. No common factors. So AP=3125/143.\n\nTherefore m=3125, n=143. Check if they are coprime. 143 factors into 11 and 13. 3125 divided by 11: 11*284=3124, so no. Divided by 13: 13*240=3120, remainder 5. So yes, coprime.\n\nThus m + n = 3125 +143 = 3268.\n\nWait, but wait, hold on. Let me double-check my steps because this seems like a big number, and maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nFirst, let me confirm DA squared was 105625/484, so DA is 325/22. That's correct because 325 squared is 105,625 and 22 squared is 484.\n\nDB squared is (225/22)^2, so DB is 225/22. Then DP is DB squared divided by DA, so (225/22)^2 divided by (325/22) = (225^2)/(22^2) * (22/325) = (225^2)/(22*325).\n\n225 squared is 50625, so 50625 divided by (22*325).\n\n22*325: 22*300=6600, 22*25=550, so total 7150.\n\nThus 50625 /7150. Let me compute that:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25: 50625/25=2025, 7150/25=286. So yes, 2025/286, so DP is 2025/286.\n\nThen AP is AD + DP = 325/22 + 2025/286.\n\nConvert 325/22 to denominator 286: 22*13=286, so multiply numerator and denominator by13: 325*13=4225, so 4225/286.\n\nAdding to 2025/286 gives (4225+2025)=6250 over 286. Then 6250/286 simplifies by dividing numerator and denominator by 2: 3125/143. Since 143 is 11\u00d713, and 3125 is 5^5, no common factors. So AP=3125/143, so m + n=3125+143=3268.\n\nHmm, but that seems like a large answer. Let me see if there's an error in the Power of a Point approach.\n\nWait, perhaps I made an error in the direction of the segments. The Power of a Point says that for a point D outside the circle, and a secant D-P-A (so D to P to A, with P and A on the circle), then DP * DA = Power(D). Wait, no, the formula is that if a secant from D passes through the circle at X and Y, with order D-X-Y, then DX * DY = Power(D). So in our case, the line goes from D to A to P (since A is on the circle between D and P?), so the points are D---A---P? Wait, no. Wait, point A is on the circle, so if D is outside, and the line DA goes from D to A (on the circle), then extending beyond A would go inside the circle, but the other intersection P must be on the other side. Wait, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me clarify the positions again.\n\nPoint D is the intersection of the two tangents at B and C, so it's outside the circle. The line AD starts at A (on the circle) and goes through D (outside). Therefore, the other intersection point P must be on the extension beyond D, so the order is A---D---P. Therefore, the secant is ADP with D between A and P. Therefore, the Power of a Point formula would be DA * DP = Power(D). Here DA is the distance from D to A, and DP is the distance from D to P. Wait, but if the points are A---D---P, then DA is from D to A (distance DA), and DP is from D to P (distance DP = DA + AP). Wait, no, if the order is A---D---P, then AP is AD + DP. Wait, but in terms of segments:\n\nAP = AD + DP,\n\nbut in terms of lengths,\n\nDA is the length from D to A,\n\nDP is the length from D to P,\n\nso DA * DP = (distance from D to A) * (distance from D to P) = Power(D).\n\nBut AP is the distance from A to P, which is equal to DP - DA, if D is between A and P? Wait no, if it's A---D---P, then AP = AD + DP,\n\nWait, no, AP is from A to P, so if D is between A and P, then AP = AD + DP,\n\nBut DA is the distance from D to A, which is the same as AD,\n\nand DP is the distance from D to P,\n\nSo DA * DP = AD * DP,\n\nBut AP = AD + DP,\n\nSo we can write DP = AP - AD,\n\nTherefore,\n\nAD*(AP - AD) = Power(D),\n\nSo AD*AP - AD\u00b2 = DB\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nAD*AP = AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD,\n\nWhich is the same as before.\n\nSo that formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, AP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD,\n\nWe had AD =325/22,\n\nDB\u00b2 = (225/22)^2,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = [ (325/22)^2 + (225/22)^2 ] / (325/22 )\n\nFactor out (1/22)^2,\n\n= [ (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2 ) / (22\u00b2) ] / (325/22 )\n\n= [ (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2 ) / (22\u00b2) ] * (22/325 )\n\n= (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2 ) / (22 *325 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n325\u00b2 = 105,625,\n\n225\u00b2 =50,625,\n\nTotal numerator: 105,625 +50,625 =156,250.\n\nThus AP =156,250/(22*325).\n\nSimplify denominator:22*325= 22*(300 +25)=6,600 +550=7,150.\n\nSo AP=156,250 /7,150.\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 50:156,250 \u00f750=3,125; 7,150 \u00f750=143.\n\nThus AP=3125/143, so that's correct.\n\nThus m +n is 3125+143= 3268.\n\nHmm, but I feel like this might be the correct answer, but the problem states \"AP can be written as the form m/n where m and n are coprime integers\". 3125 and 143 are coprime since 143 factors into 11 and13, and 3125 is 5^5, so yes, so 3268 is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's an error in calculation steps. Let me check with another approach.\n\nAlternatively, use coordinates to compute AP.\n\nWe can parametrize line AD, find the other intersection point P, then compute the distance from A to P.\n\nWe had parametrized line AD as:\n\nx(t) =26/3 - (25/6)t,\n\ny(t)=4\u221a14/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t,\n\nWe can substitute into the circle equation and solve for t.\n\nThe circle equation was x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -9x - (33\u221a14)/28 y =0.\n\nWe can plug in x(t) and y(t):\n\nLet me denote t as the parameter. We can set up the equation and solve for t.

The coefficients of t were computed as:\n\nFirst term (from x\u00b2): -2600/36,\n\nSecond term (from y\u00b2): -14*11000/1089,\n\nThird term (from -9x): +37.5,\n\nFourth term (from - (33\u221a14)/28 y): +62.5,\n\nThus total coefficient of t:\n\n-2600/36 -154000/1089 +37.5 +62.5,\n\nWait, but 37.5 +62.5 =100,\n\nSo total coefficient of t is:\n\n(-2600/36 -154000/1089 ) +100,\n\nBut when I calculated this, I had:\n\n-2600/36 \u2248-72.22,\n\n-154000/1089\u2248-141.08,\n\nSo total \u2248-213.3, plus 100 gives\u2248-113.3,\n\nBut when I did the exact calculation:\n\n-650/9 -154000/1089 +100,\n\nWait, -2600/36 =-650/9,\n\n-14*11000= -154000,\n\nSo the coefficient B is indeed -650/9 -154000/1089 +100,\n\nBut converting to common denominator:\n\n-650/9 =-650*121/1089,\n\nWait, 9*121=1089,\n\nThus,\n\n-650*121= -78,650,\n\n-154000,\n\nTotal numerator for B:\n\n-78,650 -154,000 +100*1089,\n\nWait, 100*1089=108,900,\n\nSo total numerator: (-78,650 -154,000)+108,900,\n\nWhich is (-232,650)+108,900= -123,750,\n\nSo that part is correct.\n\nThus, the calculation leading to t_p=88/169 is correct, but this contradicts the Power of a Point approach.\n\nThis means there must be a mistake in one of the methods.\n\nWait, in the Power of a Point approach, we had:\n\nAP = (AD\u00b2 + DB\u00b2)/AD,\n\nWith AD=325/22,\n\nDB=225/22,\n\nSo AD squared is (325/22)^2,\n\nDB squared is (225/22)^2,\n\nThus,\n\nAP = ( (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2)/22\u00b2 ) / (325/22 )\n\n= ( (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2)/22\u00b2 ) * (22/325 )\n\n= (325\u00b2 +225\u00b2)/(22*325 )\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n325\u00b2 =105,625,\n\n225\u00b2=50,625,\n\nTotal numerator=156,250,\n\nDenominator:22\u00d7325=7,150,\n\nThus AP=156,250 /7,150=3125/143\u224821.83,\n\nWhereas with the parametrization, t_p=88/169\u22480.52,\n\nThen AP would be the distance from A to P,\n\nWhich is t_p multiplied by the length from A to D scaled by the parameter?\n\nWait, in the parametrization, the parameter t is scaling the vector from A to D.\n\nThe length from A to D is AD=325/22,\n\nThus, when t=1, the distance from A is AD,\n\nSo when t= t_p=88/169,\n\nThe distance from A to P is t_p * AD,\n\nThus AP= (88/169)*(325/22)= (88*325)/(169*22).\n\nCompute:\n\n88 divided by22=4,\n\n325 divided by169= (169*1.923)= no, 169\u00d72=338, so 325=169\u00d71.923,\n\nWait compute 325/169= (169+156)/169=1 +156/169,\n\nBut 156/169=12\u00d713 /13\u00b2=12/13,\n\nWait 156=12\u00d713,\n\n169=13\u00b2,\n\nThus 156/169=12/13,\n\nThus 325/169=1 +12/13=25/13,\n\nWait 13\u00d725=325,\n\nYes, so 325/169=25/13,\n\nThus,\n\nAP= (88/169)*(325/22)= (88/22)*(325/169)=4*(25/13)=100/13\u22487.69,\n\nBut this contradicts the previous result of 3125/143\u224821.83.\n\nThere's a clear inconsistency here. Therefore, there must be an error in one of the approaches.\n\nWait, let me recalculate the parametrization's t_p=88/169,\n\nWait, AP would be the distance from A to P, which is the length from A to P along the line. Since the parameter t= t_p gives the position of P relative to A,\n\nIf the parametrization is x(t)=x_A + t*(x_D -x_A),\n\nthen the distance from A to P is |t_p| * |vector AD|,\n\nSince the vector from A to D has length AD,\n\nThus AP= |t_p| * AD,\n\nBut in the parametrization, when t=1, the distance from A is AD,\n\nThus, for t_p=88/169,\n\nAP= (88/169)*(325/22)= (88\u00d7325)/(169\u00d722).\n\nCompute numerator:88\u00d7325,\n\n88\u00d7300=26,400,\n\n88\u00d725=2,200,\n\nTotal:28,600,\n\nDenominator:169\u00d722=3,718,\n\nThus AP=28,600/3,718,\n\nSimplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 2:14,300/1,859,\n\nCheck if 1,859 divides into numerator:\n\n1,859 \u00d77=13,013,\n\n14,300-13,013=1,287,\n\nNot helpful.\n\nWait, but 169 is 13\u00b2,\n\n22=2\u00d711,\n\n325=25\u00d713,\n\nSo,\n\nAP= (88\u00d7325)/(169\u00d722)= ( (88/22) \u00d7 (325/169) )=4 \u00d7 (25/13)=100/13\u22487.69,\n\nWhich is different from the Power of a Point result.\n\nThis discrepancy indicates an error in one of the methods. Since both methods should agree, I must have made an error in one of them.\n\nLet me check the Power of a Point approach again.\n\nPower of D is DB\u00b2= (225/22)^2,\n\nDA is the distance from D to A, which is 325/22,\n\nThus, DP= DB\u00b2 / DA= (225\u00b2)/(22\u00b2) / (325/22)= (225\u00b2)/(22*325),\n\nCompute numerator:225\u00b2=50,625,\n\nDenominator:22\u00d7325=7,150,\n\nThus DP=50,625/7,150,\n\nSimplify,\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 25:2025/286,\n\nThus DP=2025/286,\n\nThen AP=AD + DP= (325/22)+(2025/286)=,\n\nConvert to common denominator 286:\n\n325/22= (325\u00d713)/286=4,225/286,\n\nThus total AP=4,225 +2,025=6,250 /286,\n\n6,250 divided by286:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by2:3,125/143\u224821.83,\n\nWhich is different from the parametrization's 100/13\u22487.69,\n\nThus, there is a conflict.\n\nThe error must be in the parametrization approach. Let me check the parametrization.\n\nWait, in the parametrization:\n\nx(t) = x_A + t*(x_D -x_A),\n\nSimilarly for y(t). So when t=1, we reach D,\n\nBut in the calculation of the quadratic equation, we found t_p=88/169\u22480.52,\n\nBut according to Power of a Point, the other intersection P should be beyond D, so t_p should be greater than 1,\n\nThus, the error is likely in the sign during the equation setup.\n\nLet me re-express the quadratic equation.\n\nThe quadratic equation was set up as:\n\nA t\u00b2 + B t =0,\n\nWith solutions t=0 and t= -B/A,\n\nBut if the other solution is beyond D (t>1), then -B/A must be greater than1,\n\nBut in my calculation, it was 88/169\u22480.52 <1,\n\nThis suggests that perhaps there was an error in the sign when expanding terms.\n\nLet me re-express the Power of a Point formula:\n\nPower(D)=DB\u00b2=DA * DP,\n\nWhere DA is the length from D to A,\n\nDP is the length from D to P,\n\nThus, if P is beyond D from A, then DP=DA + AP,\n\nWait no, if the points are A---D---P,\n\nThen DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P,\n\nAP is the distance from A to P,\n\nSo AP=AD + DP,\n\nBut DA=AD,\n\nThus, AP= DA + DP,\n\nPower of a Point gives DB\u00b2=DA * DP,\n\nThus,\n\nDP=DB\u00b2/DA,\n\nThus AP= DA + DB\u00b2/DA,\n\nWhich is what we had,\n\nBut according to parametrization,\n\nAP= t_p * AD,\n\nBut if t_p is the parameter beyond D,\n\nWait, the parameter t in the parametrization was defined as:\n\nx(t)=x_A + t*(x_D -x_A),\n\nThus when t=1, it's at D,\n\nTo go beyond D, need t>1,\n\nThus, the solution t_p must be greater than1,\n\nBut in our calculation, it was less than1,\n\nTherefore, there must be an error in the sign of the equation setup.\n\nLet me re-express the equation:\n\nWhen substituting into the circle equation,\n\nWe had:\n\n[x(t)]\u00b2 + [y(t)]\u00b2 -9x(t) - (33\u221a14)/28 y(t) =0,\n\nBut perhaps I missed a negative sign somewhere.\n\nLet me recheck the term - (33\u221a14)/28 y(t).\n\nPreviously I computed this term as:\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 * y(t)= -22 +62.5t,\n\nBut let me recompute:\n\ny(t)= (4\u221a14/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t),\n\nThus,\n\n- (33\u221a14)/28 * y(t)= - (33\u221a14)/28*(4\u221a14/3 - (125\u221a14/33)t )\n\n= - (33\u221a14 *4\u221a14)/(28*3) + (33\u221a14 *125\u221a14 t)/(28*33)\n\n= - (33*4*14)/(28*3) + (125*14 t)/(28 )\n\nFirst term:\n\n33/3=11,\n\nThus,\n\n- (11*4*14)/28,\n\n4*14=56,\n\n11*56=616,\n\n616/28=22,\n\nThus first term is -22,\n\nSecond term:\n\n125*14=1750,\n\n1750/28=62.5,\n\nThus second term is +62.5t,\n\nThus the term is indeed -22 +62.5t,\n\nTherefore that part is correct.\n\nThus the entire equation is correct.\n\nThen why does the quadratic solution give t_p=88/169?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of the parametrization.\n\nWait, in the parametrization,\n\nx(t)=x_A +t*(x_D -x_A),\n\nThus increasing t moves from A towards D,\n\nSo the other intersection P is on the opposite side of A from D,\n\nWait, but that can\u2019t be because D is outside the circle, so the line AD should exit the circle at P beyond D.\n\nWait, maybe the parametrization is set up such that t=0 is at A, and t=1 is at D,\n\nBut the other intersection P is actually on the other side of A, not going through D.\n\nWait, that would mean that the line AD intersects the circle again at P on the other side of A,\n\nBut geometrically, since D is outside the circle, the line AD starts at A (on the circle), goes outward to D, and then continues past D to another point P on the circle? That would require the circle to be on both sides of AD, but since it's a triangle inscribed in the circle, the line AD can\u2019t intersect the circle again beyond D unless the circle is very large, but in our coordinates, let's see.\n\nCoordinates of D are (9/2, -27\u221a14/11),\n\nCoordinates of A are (26/3, 4\u221a14/3),\n\nThe line from A to D goes from A (positive y) to D (negative y), so it's going downward,\n\nThe circle passes through A,B,C,\n\nPoint B is at (9,0),\n\nPoint C is at (0,0),\n\nThe center O is at (9/2, 33\u221a14/56),\n\nSo the circle's center is at (4.5, approx 33*3.7417/56\u2248 (4.5, approx 2.19).\n\nThus the center is near (4.5, 2.19),\n\nThe point D is at (4.5, -27\u221a14/11\u2248 -27*3.7417/11\u2248-9.15).\n\nSo the line AD goes from A (8.666, 4\u221a14/3\u2248 6.532) to D (4.5, -9.15),\n\nThis line would exit the circle again on the other side from D?\n\nWait, perhaps the parametrization is correct, and the other intersection is between A and D?\n\nBut according to the Power of a Point, the Power is DB\u00b2= (225/22)^2\u2248 (10.227)^2\u2248104.6,\n\nDA is 325/22\u224814.77,\n\nThus DA * DP =104.6,\n\nThus DP\u2248104.6 /14.77\u22487.08,\n\nThus AP=AD + DP\u224814.77+7.08\u224821.85,\n\nWhich matches the Power of a Point result.\n\nBut according to the parametrization, AP= t_p * AD\u22480.52*14.77\u22487.69,\n\nBut this is DP, the distance from D to P,\n\nWait, no. Wait, in the parametrization,\n\nIf t_p=88/169\u22480.52,\n\nThen P is located between A and D,\n\nThus the distance from A to P is t_p * AD\u22480.52*14.77\u22487.69,\n\nBut according to Power of a Point,\n\nAP should be AD + DP,\n\nWhere DP=DB\u00b2/DA\u22487.08,\n\nThus AD + DP\u224814.77+7.08\u224821.85,\n\nSo there's inconsistency.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I misunderstood the parametrization's direction.\n\nWait, in the parametrization,\n\nx(t)=x_A +t*(x_D -x_A),\n\nThus when t=0, we are at A,\n\nWhen t=1, at D,\n\nWhen t=2, beyond D,\n\nThus, to reach P beyond D, we need t_p>1,\n\nBut according to the quadratic solution,\n\nt_p=88/169\u22480.52,\n\nWhich is between A and D,\n\nThus this suggests that the other intersection is between A and D,\n\nBut according to the Power of a Point, since D is outside, the secant should intersect the circle at two points: one is A, and the other should be on the other side of D,\n\nBut in this case, the calculation shows that the other intersection is between A and D,\n\nThis suggests that the Power of a Point was applied incorrectly.\n\nWait, Power of a Point formula: for a point outside the circle, the power is equal to the product of the lengths from the point to each intersection point on a secant line.\n\nThus, if the secant line passes through D, goes through the circle at P and A,\n\nThen the power is DP * DA =DB\u00b2,\n\nWait, but if P is between A and D, then DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nDP is the distance from D to P,\n\nThus DA * DP=DB\u00b2,\n\nBut then AP=DA - DP,\n\nThus AP= DA - (DB\u00b2/DA),\n\nWhich would give AP= (DA\u00b2 -DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nWhich is different from before,\n\nBut this contradicts my previous understanding.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nLet me denote the two intersection points of line DA with the circle as A and P,\n\nWith D outside,\n\nThe points are ordered: D---P---A,\n\nThus, the distances are:\n\nDP is from D to P,\n\nPA is from P to A,\n\nThus the Power of a Point formula states DP * DA=DB\u00b2,\n\nWait, DA is the entire length from D to A,\n\nDP is from D to P,\n\nThus DA = DP + PA,\n\nThus,\n\nDP*(DP + PA)=DB\u00b2,\n\nBut this seems different.\n\nAlternatively, the formula is:\n\nIf a secant from D passes through the circle at X and Y,\n\nthen DX * DY=Power(D),\n\nwhere DX and DY are the distances from D to each intersection point,\n\nin order D---X---Y or D---Y---X,\n\nThus, if the points are D---P---A,\n\nthen DP * DA=DB\u00b2,\n\nBecause DA is the distance from D to A,\n\nand DP is from D to P,\n\nThus,\n\nDP * DA=DB\u00b2,\n\nTherefore,\n\nAP= PA= DA - DP,\n\nThus,\n\nAP= DA - (DB\u00b2/DA),\n\nThus,\n\nAP= (DA\u00b2 - DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nWhich would be,\n\nAP= ( (325/22)^2 - (225/22)^2 ) / (325/22),\n\n= ( (325\u00b2 -225\u00b2)/22\u00b2 ) / (325/22),\n\n= ( (325 -225)(325 +225)/22\u00b2 ) * (22/325 ),\n\n= (100 *550 / (22\u00b2 )) * (22/325),\n\n= (55,000 /484) * (22/325),\n\n= (55,000 *22 ) / (484 *325),\n\nSimplify:\n\n55,000 /325=169.23,\n\nBut let me compute numerator and denominator:\n\n55,000 *22 = 1,210,000,\n\n484 *325=157,300,\n\nThus,\n\nAP=1,210,000 /157,300,\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 100:12,100/1,573,\n\nCheck GCD(12100,1573):\n\n1573 \u00f712100? No, 12100 \u00f71573\u22487.69,\n\n1573\u00d77=11,011,\n\n12,100-11,011=1,089,\n\nGCD(1573,1089),\n\n1573 \u00f71089=1 rem484,\n\n1089 \u00f7484=2 rem121,\n\n484 \u00f7121=4 rem0,\n\nThus GCD is121,\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by121:\n\n12,100 \u00f7121=100,\n\n1,573 \u00f7121=13,\n\nThus AP=100/13\u22487.69,\n\nWhich matches the parametrization result.\n\nThus, my initial mistake was in the Power of a Point application. I incorrectly assumed the points were ordered A---D---P, but they are actually D---P---A, so the Power of a Point formula gives DP * DA=DB\u00b2,\n\nHence AP= DA - DP= DA - (DB\u00b2/DA)= (DA\u00b2 -DB\u00b2)/DA,\n\nThus AP= ( (325/22)^2 - (225/22)^2 )/(325/22)= ( (325^2 -225^2)/22^2 )/(325/22)= ( (325-225)(325+225)/22^2 )*(22/325)= (100*550 / (22^2)) * (22/325)= (55,000 / 484)*(22/325)= (55,000*22)/(484*325)=1,210,000/157,300=12100/1573=100/13,\n\nSo AP=100/13,\n\nThus the correct answer is 100/13, so m=100, n=13, which are coprime, so m+n=113.\n\nThis aligns with the parametrization result.\n\nSo my initial mistake was in the Power of a Point setup, assuming the point P was beyond D, but actually it's between D and A.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 100 +13=113.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{113}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\(ABC\\) inscribed in circle \\(\\omega\\), with tangents at \\(B\\) and \\(C\\) intersecting at point \\(D\\), and line \\(AD\\) intersecting \\(\\omega\\) again at \\(P\\).
