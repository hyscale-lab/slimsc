      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, where the diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin... Let me recall some properties of rhombuses. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, actually, they bisect each other, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not only bisectors but also perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So since they intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, that means if A is (a,b), then C is (-a, -b), and similarly for B and D. \n\nSo, let me denote the coordinates. Let me suppose that points A and C are on one diagonal, so A = (p, q) and C = (-p, -q). Similarly, points B and D are on the other diagonal, so B = (r, s) and D = (-r, -s). Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular. Since they are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. Let me see.\n\nFirst, since the diagonals are AC and BD. The slope of AC would be (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p. Similarly, the slope of BD would be (s - (-s))/(r - (-r)) = (2s)/(2r) = s/r. Since they are perpendicular, (q/p)*(s/r) = -1. So (qs)/(pr) = -1. So qs = -pr. That's one condition.\n\nAlso, all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So each point must satisfy this equation. So for point A: (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1, similarly for point B: (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 = 1, and points C and D will satisfy the same equations because their coordinates are negatives, so squaring makes them same as A and B.\n\nSo we have two equations from the hyperbola:\n\n1) p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n2) r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAlso, from the perpendicularity of diagonals: qs = -pr.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the distance between B and D. Since B is (r, s) and D is (-r, -s), the distance BD is sqrt[(r - (-r))\u00b2 + (s - (-s))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2r)\u00b2 + (2s)^2] = 2*sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). Therefore BD\u00b2 would be 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). So our goal is to find the infimum (the greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2, which is 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), over all possible such rhombuses. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So actually, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, but the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So that would be the infimum itself if it's not achieved. Hmm, so we need to find the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, and then the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum. Wait, but if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some number, then that number is the infimum, so the answer would be that number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe BD\u00b2 has a minimum value, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be that minimum value. Wait, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" so if there is a minimum value m, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be approaching m from below, but m itself would not be less. So actually, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get as close as possible to some lower bound but never actually reaches it, so the infimum would be that lower bound, which is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe BD\u00b2 has a minimum. Let me see. Let's try to express BD\u00b2 in terms of variables that can be related through the equations given.\n\nFirst, let me see if I can relate p, q, r, s. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, qs = -pr. Let's see if we can parameterize the points. Maybe using parametric equations for hyperbola?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of parameters. Let me think. Let me suppose that points A and C are on one diagonal. Let me consider the diagonal AC. Since they are on the hyperbola, perhaps parameterize point A as (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D are (u, v) and (-u, -v). \n\nSo, we can write equations for the hyperbola:\n\nFor point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nFor point B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nAlso, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. The direction vectors of the diagonals are (2x, 2y) and (2u, 2v). Wait, the vectors from the origin to A and to B? Wait, the diagonals are AC and BD. The vectors along the diagonals would be from A to C is (-2x, -2y), but the direction is along ( -2x, -2y). Alternatively, the direction vector of AC is (C - A) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, the direction vector of BD is (-2u, -2v). The diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of their direction vectors should be zero. Wait, hold on. Wait, actually, the diagonals themselves are perpendicular. The diagonals are AC and BD. So the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. The vector AC is from A to C: (-2x, -2y). The vector BD is from B to D: (-2u, -2v). So their dot product should be zero:\n\n(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0 \u2192 4xu + 4yv = 0 \u2192 xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo that's another equation. So we have:\n\n1) x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n2) u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n3) xu + yv =0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So to minimize BD\u00b2, we can focus on minimizing (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2) subject to the constraints given by equations 1, 2, and 3.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers here, but since this is a hyperbola and the equations are a bit involved, maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, express variables in terms of parameters.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing the hyperbola. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a standard parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). Let me try that. Let me set point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Since a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5, and b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6. So coordinates would be (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly, point B can be parametrized as (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Wait, but we have two points A and B, so maybe parametrizing both with different angles?\n\nWait, but since the points are on the hyperbola, this parametrization might be helpful. Let me try that.\n\nLet me let point A be (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8) = (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly, point B is (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Then points C and D are the negatives of these coordinates.\n\nThen, the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular would be the vectors AC and BD being perpendicular. The vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). The vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Wait, but the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. Wait, actually, the vectors representing the diagonals are AC and BD. Wait, actually, the vectors themselves are AC = C - A = (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) - (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) = (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Wait, actually, no. Wait, the vector AC is from point A to point C. So if A is (x,y), then C is (-x, -y), so vector AC is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D: (-2u, -2v). Wait, but in terms of the parametrization, points A and B are (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) and (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Therefore, the vectors AC and BD would be (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8) and (-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Wait, but actually, the vector AC is (-2x, -2y) where x and y are coordinates of A. So in terms of \u03b8, that would be (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly BD is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Wait, but to compute the dot product of AC and BD vectors, which must be zero for perpendicularity:\n\n[ -4\u221a5 sec\u03b8 * -4\u221a5 sec\u03c6 ] + [ -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8 * -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6 ] = 0 ?\n\nWait, let me recast this properly. The vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. Let me compute the vectors:\n\nVector AC: from A to C is (-2x, -2y), where x = 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, y = 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8. So AC vector is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v), where u = 2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, v = 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6. So BD vector is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6).\n\nWait, but actually, the direction of BD is from B to D, so it's (-2u, -2v). So the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2u, -2v). Therefore, their dot product is:\n\n(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 4xu + 4yv = 0 \u21d2 xu + yv = 0. Which is the same as equation 3 above.\n\nSo in terms of the parameters \u03b8 and \u03c6, this becomes:\n\nxu + yv = (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8)(2\u221a5 sec\u03c6) + (2\u221a6 tan\u03b8)(2\u221a6 tan\u03c6) = 0\n\nCompute that:\n\n(2\u221a5)(2\u221a5) sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + (2\u221a6)(2\u221a6) tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nWhich is 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nHmm, that's an equation involving \u03b8 and \u03c6. Hmm, perhaps we can set variables so that \u03b8 and \u03c6 are related somehow?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set \u03c6 = something in terms of \u03b8. Alternatively, since we need to minimize BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Let's compute BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6:\n\nu = 2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, v = 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6, so u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (20 sec\u00b2\u03c6) + (24 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 20 + 20 tan\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 20 + 44 tan\u00b2\u03c6. Therefore BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6. So to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6, so the minimal value would be 80 when tan\u03c6 =0. But is that possible?\n\nWait, but tan\u03c6=0 would mean \u03c6=0, so point B would be (2\u221a5*1, 0), since tan\u03c6=0. But then, let me check if that is allowed. Let me see if when \u03c6=0, then the equation xu + yv =0 is satisfied?\n\nIf \u03c6=0, then point B is (2\u221a5, 0). Then, x is 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, y is 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8. So plugging into xu + yv:\n\nxu = (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8)(2\u221a5) = 20 sec\u03b8,\n\nyv = (2\u221a6 tan\u03b8)(0) =0,\n\nSo total is 20 sec\u03b8 =0? But that's impossible because sec\u03b8 can't be zero. So tan\u03c6=0 is not allowed here. So that suggests that the minimal value can't be achieved at \u03c6=0. So there's a constraint here from the equation 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we need to find \u03b8 and \u03c6 such that this equation holds, and then express BD\u00b2 in terms of one variable and find its minimum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express everything in terms of \u03b8 and then find BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can set variables such that the equation 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0 can be manipulated. Let me divide both sides by sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 (assuming they are non-zero):\n\n20 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 / (sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6) =0.\n\nBut tan\u03b8 / sec\u03b8 = sin\u03b8, and tan\u03c6 / sec\u03c6 = sin\u03c6. So:\n\n20 +24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0 \u2192 24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20 \u2192 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, interesting. So sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. So that's a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6. So perhaps express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8 or vice versa?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables such that sin\u03b8 = a, sin\u03c6 = b, then ab = -5/6. But also, since points A and B are on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equations. Wait, but perhaps there are other constraints here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set \u03c6 = -\u03b8? Let me try that. If \u03c6 = -\u03b8, then sin\u03c6 = -sin\u03b8, so sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -sin\u00b2\u03b8. So -sin\u00b2\u03b8 = -5/6 \u2192 sin\u00b2\u03b8 =5/6. That would work. So if \u03c6 = -\u03b8, then this equation is satisfied. Let me check.\n\nSuppose \u03c6 = -\u03b8. Then, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = sin\u03b8 sin(-\u03b8) = -sin\u00b2\u03b8 = -5/6 \u21d2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 =5/6. So that's okay. Then, let's see if that works. Let me see if with this substitution, we can compute BD\u00b2.\n\nIf \u03c6 = -\u03b8, then point B is (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6) = (2\u221a5 sec(-\u03b8), 2\u221a6 tan(-\u03b8)) = (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Since sec is even and tan is odd.\n\nSo BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2) where u =2\u221a5 sec\u03b8 and v = -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8. Therefore, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (20 sec\u00b2\u03b8) + (24 tan\u00b2\u03b8). Let me compute this:\n\n20 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8 =20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8) +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8 =20 +20 tan\u00b2\u03b8 +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8 =20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03b8. So BD\u00b2 =4*(20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03b8)= 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut we also have from sin\u00b2\u03b8 =5/6. Since sin\u00b2\u03b8 =5/6, then cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1 -5/6=1/6, so tan\u00b2\u03b8 = (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/(cos\u00b2\u03b8)= (5/6)/(1/6)=5. Therefore tan\u00b2\u03b8 =5. Therefore BD\u00b2 would be 80 +176*5 =80 +880=960. Hmm, so in this case, BD\u00b2=960. But is this the minimal value?\n\nWait, but maybe there are other angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 where sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =-5/6 but not necessarily \u03c6=-\u03b8. So perhaps this is just one case. Maybe there are other configurations where BD\u00b2 is smaller?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is the minimal case, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is 960. But I need to confirm if this is indeed the minimum.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me suppose that the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when \u03c6 = -\u03b8, as above, but maybe there's a case where BD\u00b2 can be smaller. Let me see.\n\nSuppose we have another relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6. Let me suppose that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, but with different angles. Let me see if there is a way to write BD\u00b2 in terms of sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8. Let me see:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8, but only when \u03c6=-\u03b8. Wait, but if we take another relation, perhaps BD\u00b2 can be expressed differently. Alternatively, maybe there is a different parametrization.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of variables x, y, u, v with the three equations:\n\n1) x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n2) u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n3) xu + yv =0,\n\nand BD\u00b2 =4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). We can try to express variables in terms of each other.\n\nFrom equation 3: xu = -yv \u21d2 v = - (xu)/y (assuming y \u22600). Substitute into equation 2:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 u\u00b2)/y\u00b2 ] /24 =1\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 u\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) =1\n\nFactor out u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)] =1\n\nHmm, but from equation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 \u21d2 x\u00b2 =20(1 + y\u00b2/24). Let me substitute x\u00b2 into the above expression.\n\nFirst, compute 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) =1/20 - [20(1 + y\u00b2/24)] / (24 y\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\nx\u00b2 =20*(1 + y\u00b2/24)\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = [20*(1 + y\u00b2/24)] / (24 y\u00b2) = [20/(24 y\u00b2)] + [20*(y\u00b2/24)]/(24 y\u00b2 )\n\n= (20)/(24 y\u00b2) + (20)/(24*24) \n\nWait, let me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 20/(24 y\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y\u00b2)\n\nSecond term: [20*(y\u00b2/24)]/(24 y\u00b2) = [20 y\u00b2 /24 ] / (24 y\u00b2) )= (20)/(24*24) = 20/(576)=5/144.\n\nSo overall,\n\nx\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) =5/(6 y\u00b2) +5/144.\n\nTherefore,\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) =1/20 -5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144.\n\nThus,\n\nu\u00b2 [1/20 -5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144 ] =1.\n\nThis seems complicated, perhaps there is a better way. Let me try to set variables in terms of parameters. Let me suppose that point A is (x,y), then point C is (-x,-y). Then, the other diagonal BD is such that points B and D are (u,v) and (-u,-v). The condition xu + yv=0 must hold. So the coordinates of B must satisfy xu + yv =0. Since B is on the hyperbola, (u\u00b2)/20 - (v\u00b2)/24 =1. Let me try to express v in terms of u, x, y from the first equation: v = - (xu)/y. Substitute into the hyperbola equation for B:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 u\u00b2)/y\u00b2 ] /24 =1,\n\nSame as before. Let me write this equation again:\n\nu\u00b2 [1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nLet me denote the term in the bracket as K =1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2).\n\nSo K = [ (12 y\u00b2 - 5 x\u00b2 ) ] / (240 y\u00b2 )\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n1/20 =12/(240)\n\nand (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) = (10 x\u00b2)/(240 y\u00b2)\n\nWait, perhaps better to get a common denominator:\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = (12 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)/(240 y\u00b2 )\n\nWait, let me compute 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2):\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator appropriately to get denominator 240 y\u00b2:\n\n1/20 = 12 y\u00b2 / (240 y\u00b2)\n\nx\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = 10 x\u00b2 / (240 y\u00b2)\n\nThus,\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2)/ (240 y\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nu\u00b2 * [ (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 ) / (240 y\u00b2 ) ] =1 \u21d2 u\u00b2 = 240 y\u00b2 / (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, so u\u00b2 is expressed in terms of x and y. Then BD\u00b2 is 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Since v= -xu/y, so v\u00b2 =x\u00b2 u\u00b2 / y\u00b2. Therefore,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4(u\u00b2 + x\u00b2 u\u00b2 / y\u00b2 ) =4 u\u00b2 (1 +x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 )\n\nSubstitute u\u00b2 from above:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [240 y\u00b2 / (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 ) ] * (1 +x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute this expression step by step:\n\nFirst, 1 +x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2)/y\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [240 y\u00b2 / (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 ) ] * ( (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2)/y\u00b2 ) \n\nSimplify:\n\nThe y\u00b2 cancels:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 *240 / (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 ) * (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 )\n\nSo BD\u00b2 = (960 (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 )) / (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 )\n\nNow, from the hyperbola equation for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 \u21d2 x\u00b2 =20(1 + y\u00b2/24 )\n\nLet me substitute x\u00b2 into the above expression.\n\nFirst, let me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 = y\u00b2 +20(1 + y\u00b2/24 ) = y\u00b2 +20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + y\u00b2 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 =20 + (11/6)y\u00b2\n\nDenominator:12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 =12 y\u00b2 -10*(20 + (y\u00b2)/ (24/20) )? Wait, let's compute x\u00b2 properly.\n\nWait x\u00b2 =20*(1 + y\u00b2/24 )=20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 =20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nTherefore, denominator:12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 =12 y\u00b2 -10*(20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) =12 y\u00b2 -200 - (50 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n12 y\u00b2 = (72 y\u00b2)/6,\n\nso:\n\n(72 y\u00b2)/6 - (50 y\u00b2)/6 -200 = (22 y\u00b2)/6 -200 = (11 y\u00b2)/3 -200.\n\nThus,\n\nDenominator: (11 y\u00b2)/3 -200.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 =960*(20 + (11/6)y\u00b2 ) / [ (11 y\u00b2)/3 -200 ]\n\nLet me simplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 20 + (11/6)y\u00b2 = (120 +11 y\u00b2)/6\n\nDenominator: (11 y\u00b2 - 600)/3\n\nTherefore,\n\nBD\u00b2= 960 * [ (120 +11 y\u00b2)/6 ] / [ (11 y\u00b2 -600)/3 ]\n\n= 960 * [ (120 +11 y\u00b2)/6 * 3/(11 y\u00b2 -600) ]\n\n=960 * [ (120 +11 y\u00b2) *3 / (6*(11 y\u00b2 -600)) ]\n\nSimplify 3/6=1/2,\n\n=960 * (120 +11 y\u00b2)/ (2*(11 y\u00b2 -600))\n\n=480*(120 +11 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2=480*(120 +11 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of this expression. Let me denote z = y\u00b2. Since y\u00b2 can be any positive real number such that the hyperbola equation holds. Since point A is on the hyperbola, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 \u21d2 x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24), so y can be any real number except where the denominator in BD\u00b2 becomes problematic. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the denominator in the BD\u00b2 expression is 11 y\u00b2 -600. Since in the denominator of the original expression (12 y\u00b2 -10x\u00b2), which after substitution became 11 y\u00b2 /3 -200. So 11 y\u00b2 -600 must not be zero, so 11 y\u00b2 \u2260600 \u21d2 y\u00b2 \u2260600/11 \u224854.545...\n\nAlso, the denominator must not be zero, so 11 y\u00b2 -600 \u22600.\n\nAdditionally, the denominator in the expression for u\u00b2 must be non-zero, so 12 y\u00b2 -10x\u00b2 \u22600. Let me see:\n\n12 y\u00b2 -10x\u00b2 =12 y\u00b2 -10*(20 +5 y\u00b2/6)=12 y\u00b2 -200 - (50 y\u00b2)/6 = same as before, leading to denominator.\n\nSo, as long as y\u00b2 \u2260600/11, that's okay.\n\nNow, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, we can consider BD\u00b2 as a function of z = y\u00b2, where z must satisfy:\n\n1. From hyperbola equation, since x\u00b2 must be positive, but since x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24), this is always positive as long as y\u00b2 is real.\n\n2. The denominator 11 z -600 \u22600 \u21d2 z\u2260600/11.\n\nAdditionally, in the expression for u\u00b2, which is 240 y\u00b2/(12 y\u00b2 -10x\u00b2 ), substituting x\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2=240 z/(12 z -10*(20 +5 z/6 ))=240 z/(12 z -200 -50 z/6 )\n\nWait, let's compute denominator again:\n\n12 z -10x\u00b2 =12 z -10*(20 + (5 z)/6 ) =12 z -200 - (50 z)/6\n\nWhich is same as before.\n\nSo, the denominator 12 z -10x\u00b2 must have the same sign as the numerator in u\u00b2, since u\u00b2 must be positive. So,\n\n240 z divided by (12 z - (200 +50 z/6 )) must be positive. Let me compute the denominator:\n\n12 z -200 - (50 z)/6 = (72 z - 1200 -50 z)/6 = (22 z -1200)/6.\n\nWait, 12 z is 72 z/6, and 50 z/6 is as is. So:\n\n12 z =72 z/6,\n\nSo:\n\nDenominator: 72 z/6 -200 -50 z/6 = (72 z -50 z)/6 -200 = (22 z)/6 -200 = (11 z)/3 -200.\n\nTherefore denominator of u\u00b2 is (11 z)/3 -200, so for u\u00b2 to be positive, (11 z)/3 -200 must have the same sign as 240 z. Since 240 z is positive (z is positive), so (11 z)/3 -200 must be positive. So,\n\n(11 z)/3 -200 >0 \u21d2 11 z >600 \u21d2 z>600/11\u224854.545.\n\nTherefore, z must be greater than 600/11. So the domain of z is z>600/11.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is a function of z where z>600/11, and BD\u00b2=480*(120 +11 z)/(11 z -600).\n\nWe can write this as BD\u00b2(z)=480*(120 +11 z)/(11 z -600). Let me see if we can simplify this expression:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 120 +11 z =11 z +120\n\nDenominator:11 z -600\n\nLet me write BD\u00b2(z)=480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600)\n\nLet me perform the division:\n\nLet me write numerator as 11 z -600 + 720,\n\nBecause 11 z -600 +720=11 z +120,\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2(z)=480*( (11 z -600) +720 )/(11 z -600) =480*[1 + 720/(11 z -600)]\n\nTherefore,\n\nBD\u00b2(z)=480 + 480*(720)/(11 z -600)=480 + (480*720)/(11 z -600)\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2(z)=480 + (345600)/(11 z -600)\n\nNow, since z>600/11, then 11 z -600 is positive, so the term (345600)/(11 z -600) is positive. Therefore, BD\u00b2(z)=480 + something positive. So the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when the second term is minimized, which occurs when (11 z -600) is maximized. Wait, but as z increases, 11 z -600 increases, so 345600/(11 z -600) decreases. Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is when z approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. But can z be made arbitrarily large?\n\nWait, but as z approaches infinity, the term 345600/(11 z -600) approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480. However, z is y\u00b2, so as y\u00b2 increases, does that correspond to a valid point on the hyperbola?\n\nYes, because the hyperbola extends to infinity. So in theory, as z increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. Therefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it is never actually reached because that would require z to be infinity. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, since BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 but never actually be less than or equal to it. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So since BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but never actually be less than 480, then 480 is the infimum, so the answer is 480. \n\nWait but in the earlier case where we set \u03c6=-\u03b8 and got BD\u00b2=960, that seems contradictory. Wait, but perhaps that case was a specific instance, but there are other cases where BD\u00b2 is smaller? Wait, but according to this analysis, BD\u00b2 can approach 480. So maybe my earlier assumption with \u03c6=-\u03b8 gives a specific case but there are other configurations where BD\u00b2 can be smaller.\n\nWait, let me check with z approaching infinity. Let me see.\n\nSuppose z is very large, so y\u00b2 is very large. Then, point A is (x,y) where x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24). So as y becomes large, x\u2248 sqrt(20*(y\u00b2/24)) = y*sqrt(20/24)=y*sqrt(5/6). So coordinates of A are approximately (y*sqrt(5/6), y). Then, the condition xu + yv=0 must be satisfied. Let me see, with B's coordinates (u, v). Since u and v are related through the hyperbola equation.\n\nIf we take y to be very large, then x\u2248 sqrt(5/6) y. So xu + yv \u2248 sqrt(5/6) y u + y v = y( sqrt(5/6) u + v )=0 \u21d2 sqrt(5/6) u + v=0 \u21d2 v= - sqrt(5/6) u.\n\nThen, plugging into the hyperbola equation for B:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1 \u21d2 u\u00b2/20 - ( (5/6) u\u00b2 )/24 =1 \u21d2 u\u00b2/20 - (5 u\u00b2)/(144)=1.\n\nCompute:\n\nLet me find common denominator 720:\n\n(36 u\u00b2)/720 - (25 u\u00b2)/720 = (11 u\u00b2)/720 =1 \u21d2 u\u00b2=720/11 \u21d2 u= sqrt(720/11). So v= -sqrt(5/6)*sqrt(720/11).\n\nThen BD\u00b2=4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)=4(u\u00b2 + (5/6)u\u00b2)=4*(11/6 u\u00b2)= (22/3)*u\u00b2= (22/3)*(720/11)= (22/3)*(720/11)= (2/3)*(720)= 480. So in the limit as z approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So the infimum is indeed 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480. So the answer is 480. Wait, but in the case where we set \u03c6 = -\u03b8, we found BD\u00b2=960, which is much larger, so that's just one case, but there are other cases where BD\u00b2 can be made as small as approaching 480. Therefore, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is approaching 480, so the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480. \n\nBut let me check with another example. Let me choose a very large y. Let me pick y\u00b2= 600/11 +\u03b5, where \u03b5 is small, so z just slightly above 600/11. Let me set z=600/11 +1. So z= (600 +11)/11=611/11\u224855.545. Wait, but earlier we had that z must be greater than 600/11\u224854.545, so 55.545 is okay. Then compute BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2(z)=480*(120 +11 z)/(11 z -600)\n\nPlugging in z=611/11:\n\n11 z=611,\n\n120 +11 z=120+611=731,\n\n11 z -600=11,\n\nSo BD\u00b2=480*(731)/11\u2248480*66.454\u2248480*66 +480*0.454\u224831680 + 217.9\u224831897.9. Wait, that's not approaching 480. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, what did I do wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps my substitution was incorrect. Wait, z is y\u00b2. Wait, if z=600/11 + \u03b5, then 11 z -600=11*(600/11 +\u03b5) -600=600 +11\u03b5 -600=11\u03b5. So when z approaches 600/11 from above, 11 z -600 approaches 0, so BD\u00b2(z)=480*(120 +11 z)/(11 z -600) would approach infinity. Wait, that's the opposite. So when z approaches 600/11 from above, BD\u00b2 goes to infinity. When z increases to infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So the function BD\u00b2(z) has a horizontal asymptote at 480 as z\u2192infty, and as z approaches 600/11 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. Therefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is indeed 480, approached as z\u2192infty. So, in that case, the infimum is 480, so the answer should be 480.\n\nWait, but when I took z=611/11\u224855.545, which is just above 600/11\u224854.545, the BD\u00b2 was very large. But when I take z=1000, which is much larger, then BD\u00b2(z)=480*(120 +11*1000)/(11*1000 -600)=480*(120+11000)/(11000-600)=480*(11120)/10400\u2248480*(1.069)=\u2248513. So it's decreasing towards 480. \n\nWait, let me compute with z=1000:\n\nNumerator:120 +11*1000=11120,\n\nDenominator:11*1000-600=11000-600=10400,\n\n11120/10400=1.06923,\n\nSo 480*1.06923\u2248513. So BD\u00b2\u2248513, which is closer to 480.\n\nAt z=10000:\n\nBD\u00b2(z)=480*(120 +110000)/(110000 -600)=480*(110120)/(109400)=480*(1.0066)=\u2248483.168, getting closer to 480.\n\nSo yes, as z increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. Therefore, the minimal value is 480, so the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. Therefore, the answer is 480. \n\nBut let me confirm with another approach. Suppose we let variables approach infinity such that BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So in that case, the minimal possible value is 480, so the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". Since BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480, then 480 is the infimum. So the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. Because any number greater than 480 would not be less than all BD\u00b2 (since BD\u00b2 can be 480.0001, so 480.0002 would not be less than that). So the supremum of all numbers less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. So the answer is 480. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 480. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, where the diagonals intersect at the origin. Hmm, rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin... Let me recall some properties of rhombuses. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, right? Wait, actually, they bisect each other, but they aren't necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not only bisectors but also perpendicular. Yes, that's correct. So in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So since they intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, that means if A is (a,b), then C is (-a, -b), and similarly for B and D. \n\nSo, let me denote the coordinates. Let me suppose that points A and C are on one diagonal, so A = (p, q) and C = (-p, -q). Similarly, points B and D are on the other diagonal, so B = (r, s) and D = (-r, -s). Since ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. Also, the diagonals are perpendicular. Since they are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. Let me see.\n\nFirst, since the diagonals are AC and BD. The slope of AC would be (q - (-q))/(p - (-p)) = (2q)/(2p) = q/p. Similarly, the slope of BD would be (s - (-s))/(r - (-r)) = (2s)/(2r) = s/r. Since they are perpendicular, (q/p)*(s/r) = -1. So (qs)/(pr) = -1. So qs = -pr. That's one condition.\n\nAlso, all four points lie on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So each point must satisfy this equation. So for point A: (p\u00b2)/20 - (q\u00b2)/24 = 1, similarly for point B: (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 = 1, and points C and D will satisfy the same equations because their coordinates are negatives, so squaring makes them same as A and B.\n\nSo we have two equations from the hyperbola:\n\n1) p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 = 1\n\n2) r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 = 1\n\nAlso, from the perpendicularity of diagonals: qs = -pr.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the distance between B and D. Since B is (r, s) and D is (-r, -s), the distance BD is sqrt[(r - (-r))\u00b2 + (s - (-s))\u00b2] = sqrt[(2r)\u00b2 + (2s)^2] = 2*sqrt(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). Therefore BD\u00b2 would be 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2). So our goal is to find the infimum (the greatest lower bound) of BD\u00b2, which is 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), over all possible such rhombuses. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So actually, we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2, but the question is asking for the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. So that would be the infimum itself if it's not achieved. Hmm, so we need to find the minimal possible value of BD\u00b2, and then the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum. Wait, but if BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some number, then that number is the infimum, so the answer would be that number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe BD\u00b2 has a minimum value, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be that minimum value. Wait, but the problem says \"less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi,\" so if there is a minimum value m, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be approaching m from below, but m itself would not be less. So actually, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get as close as possible to some lower bound but never actually reaches it, so the infimum would be that lower bound, which is the answer. \n\nAlternatively, maybe BD\u00b2 has a minimum. Let me see. Let's try to express BD\u00b2 in terms of variables that can be related through the equations given.\n\nFirst, let me see if I can relate p, q, r, s. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, qs = -pr. Let's see if we can parameterize the points. Maybe using parametric equations for hyperbola?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables in terms of parameters. Let me think. Let me suppose that points A and C are on one diagonal. Let me consider the diagonal AC. Since they are on the hyperbola, perhaps parameterize point A as (x, y), then point C is (-x, -y). Similarly, points B and D are (u, v) and (-u, -v). \n\nSo, we can write equations for the hyperbola:\n\nFor point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1,\n\nFor point B: u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nAlso, the diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular. The direction vectors of the diagonals are (2x, 2y) and (2u, 2v). Wait, the vectors from the origin to A and to B? Wait, the diagonals are AC and BD. The vectors along the diagonals would be from A to C is (-2x, -2y), but the direction is along ( -2x, -2y). Alternatively, the direction vector of AC is (C - A) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, the direction vector of BD is (-2u, -2v). The diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of their direction vectors should be zero. Wait, hold on. Wait, actually, the diagonals themselves are perpendicular. The diagonals are AC and BD. So the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. The vector AC is from A to C: (-2x, -2y). The vector BD is from B to D: (-2u, -2v). So their dot product should be zero:\n\n(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 0 \u2192 4xu + 4yv = 0 \u2192 xu + yv = 0.\n\nSo that's another equation. So we have:\n\n1) x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n2) u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n3) xu + yv =0.\n\nWe need to find BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). So to minimize BD\u00b2, we can focus on minimizing (u\u00b2 + v\u00b2) subject to the constraints given by equations 1, 2, and 3.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers here, but since this is a hyperbola and the equations are a bit involved, maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, express variables in terms of parameters.\n\nLet me consider parametrizing the hyperbola. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a standard parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). Let me try that. Let me set point A as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Since a\u00b2=20, so a=2\u221a5, and b\u00b2=24, so b=2\u221a6. So coordinates would be (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly, point B can be parametrized as (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Wait, but we have two points A and B, so maybe parametrizing both with different angles?\n\nWait, but since the points are on the hyperbola, this parametrization might be helpful. Let me try that.\n\nLet me let point A be (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8) = (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly, point B is (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Then points C and D are the negatives of these coordinates.\n\nThen, the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular would be the vectors AC and BD being perpendicular. The vector AC is from A to C, which is (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). The vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Wait, but the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. Wait, actually, the vectors representing the diagonals are AC and BD. Wait, actually, the vectors themselves are AC = C - A = (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) - (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) = (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Wait, actually, no. Wait, the vector AC is from point A to point C. So if A is (x,y), then C is (-x, -y), so vector AC is (-x - x, -y - y) = (-2x, -2y). Similarly, BD is from B to D: (-2u, -2v). Wait, but in terms of the parametrization, points A and B are (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) and (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Therefore, the vectors AC and BD would be (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8) and (-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Wait, but actually, the vector AC is (-2x, -2y) where x and y are coordinates of A. So in terms of \u03b8, that would be (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly BD is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Wait, but to compute the dot product of AC and BD vectors, which must be zero for perpendicularity:\n\n[ -4\u221a5 sec\u03b8 * -4\u221a5 sec\u03c6 ] + [ -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8 * -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6 ] = 0 ?\n\nWait, let me recast this properly. The vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. Let me compute the vectors:\n\nVector AC: from A to C is (-2x, -2y), where x = 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, y = 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8. So AC vector is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly, vector BD is from B to D, which is (-2u, -2v), where u = 2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, v = 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6. So BD vector is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6).\n\nWait, but actually, the direction of BD is from B to D, so it's (-2u, -2v). So the vectors AC and BD are (-2x, -2y) and (-2u, -2v). Therefore, their dot product is:\n\n(-2x)(-2u) + (-2y)(-2v) = 4xu + 4yv = 0 \u21d2 xu + yv = 0. Which is the same as equation 3 above.\n\nSo in terms of the parameters \u03b8 and \u03c6, this becomes:\n\nxu + yv = (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8)(2\u221a5 sec\u03c6) + (2\u221a6 tan\u03b8)(2\u221a6 tan\u03c6) = 0\n\nCompute that:\n\n(2\u221a5)(2\u221a5) sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + (2\u221a6)(2\u221a6) tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nWhich is 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 0\n\nHmm, that's an equation involving \u03b8 and \u03c6. Hmm, perhaps we can set variables so that \u03b8 and \u03c6 are related somehow?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set \u03c6 = something in terms of \u03b8. Alternatively, since we need to minimize BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Let's compute BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6:\n\nu = 2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, v = 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6, so u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (20 sec\u00b2\u03c6) + (24 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 20 + 20 tan\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 = 20 + 44 tan\u00b2\u03c6. Therefore BD\u00b2 = 4*(20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03c6) = 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03c6. So to minimize BD\u00b2, we need to minimize tan\u00b2\u03c6, so the minimal value would be 80 when tan\u03c6 =0. But is that possible?\n\nWait, but tan\u03c6=0 would mean \u03c6=0, so point B would be (2\u221a5*1, 0), since tan\u03c6=0. But then, let me check if that is allowed. Let me see if when \u03c6=0, then the equation xu + yv =0 is satisfied?\n\nIf \u03c6=0, then point B is (2\u221a5, 0). Then, x is 2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, y is 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8. So plugging into xu + yv:\n\nxu = (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8)(2\u221a5) = 20 sec\u03b8,\n\nyv = (2\u221a6 tan\u03b8)(0) =0,\n\nSo total is 20 sec\u03b8 =0? But that's impossible because sec\u03b8 can't be zero. So tan\u03c6=0 is not allowed here. So that suggests that the minimal value can't be achieved at \u03c6=0. So there's a constraint here from the equation 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we need to find \u03b8 and \u03c6 such that this equation holds, and then express BD\u00b2 in terms of one variable and find its minimum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express everything in terms of \u03b8 and then find BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if I can set variables such that the equation 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0 can be manipulated. Let me divide both sides by sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 (assuming they are non-zero):\n\n20 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 / (sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6) =0.\n\nBut tan\u03b8 / sec\u03b8 = sin\u03b8, and tan\u03c6 / sec\u03c6 = sin\u03c6. So:\n\n20 +24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0 \u2192 24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20 \u2192 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, interesting. So sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. So that's a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6. So perhaps express \u03c6 in terms of \u03b8 or vice versa?\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables such that sin\u03b8 = a, sin\u03c6 = b, then ab = -5/6. But also, since points A and B are on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy the hyperbola equations. Wait, but perhaps there are other constraints here. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set \u03c6 = -\u03b8? Let me try that. If \u03c6 = -\u03b8, then sin\u03c6 = -sin\u03b8, so sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -sin\u00b2\u03b8. So -sin\u00b2\u03b8 = -5/6 \u2192 sin\u00b2\u03b8 =5/6. That would work. So if \u03c6 = -\u03b8, then this equation is satisfied. Let me check.\n\nSuppose \u03c6 = -\u03b8. Then, sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = sin\u03b8 sin(-\u03b8) = -sin\u00b2\u03b8 = -5/6 \u21d2 sin\u00b2\u03b8 =5/6. So that's okay. Then, let's see if that works. Let me see if with this substitution, we can compute BD\u00b2.\n\nIf \u03c6 = -\u03b8, then point B is (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6) = (2\u221a5 sec(-\u03b8), 2\u221a6 tan(-\u03b8)) = (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Since sec is even and tan is odd.\n\nSo BD\u00b2 = 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2) where u =2\u221a5 sec\u03b8 and v = -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8. Therefore, u\u00b2 + v\u00b2 = (20 sec\u00b2\u03b8) + (24 tan\u00b2\u03b8). Let me compute this:\n\n20 sec\u00b2\u03b8 +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8 =20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03b8) +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8 =20 +20 tan\u00b2\u03b8 +24 tan\u00b2\u03b8 =20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03b8. So BD\u00b2 =4*(20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03b8)= 80 + 176 tan\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nBut we also have from sin\u00b2\u03b8 =5/6. Since sin\u00b2\u03b8 =5/6, then cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1 -5/6=1/6, so tan\u00b2\u03b8 = (sin\u00b2\u03b8)/(cos\u00b2\u03b8)= (5/6)/(1/6)=5. Therefore tan\u00b2\u03b8 =5. Therefore BD\u00b2 would be 80 +176*5 =80 +880=960. Hmm, so in this case, BD\u00b2=960. But is this the minimal value?\n\nWait, but maybe there are other angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 where sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =-5/6 but not necessarily \u03c6=-\u03b8. So perhaps this is just one case. Maybe there are other configurations where BD\u00b2 is smaller?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is the minimal case, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is 960. But I need to confirm if this is indeed the minimum.\n\nWait, let me think again. Let me suppose that the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when \u03c6 = -\u03b8, as above, but maybe there's a case where BD\u00b2 can be smaller. Let me see.\n\nSuppose we have another relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6. Let me suppose that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, but with different angles. Let me see if there is a way to write BD\u00b2 in terms of sin\u03b8 and sin\u03c6?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03b8. Let me see:\n\nBD\u00b2 = 80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03b8, but only when \u03c6=-\u03b8. Wait, but if we take another relation, perhaps BD\u00b2 can be expressed differently. Alternatively, maybe there is a different parametrization.\n\nAlternatively, let's think of variables x, y, u, v with the three equations:\n\n1) x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n2) u\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1,\n\n3) xu + yv =0,\n\nand BD\u00b2 =4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). We can try to express variables in terms of each other.\n\nFrom equation 3: xu = -yv \u21d2 v = - (xu)/y (assuming y \u22600). Substitute into equation 2:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 u\u00b2)/y\u00b2 ] /24 =1\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - (x\u00b2 u\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) =1\n\nFactor out u\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2 [1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2)] =1\n\nHmm, but from equation 1: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 \u21d2 x\u00b2 =20(1 + y\u00b2/24). Let me substitute x\u00b2 into the above expression.\n\nFirst, compute 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) =1/20 - [20(1 + y\u00b2/24)] / (24 y\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute that step by step:\n\nx\u00b2 =20*(1 + y\u00b2/24)\n\nSo,\n\nx\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = [20*(1 + y\u00b2/24)] / (24 y\u00b2) = [20/(24 y\u00b2)] + [20*(y\u00b2/24)]/(24 y\u00b2 )\n\n= (20)/(24 y\u00b2) + (20)/(24*24) \n\nWait, let me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 20/(24 y\u00b2) = (5)/(6 y\u00b2)\n\nSecond term: [20*(y\u00b2/24)]/(24 y\u00b2) = [20 y\u00b2 /24 ] / (24 y\u00b2) )= (20)/(24*24) = 20/(576)=5/144.\n\nSo overall,\n\nx\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) =5/(6 y\u00b2) +5/144.\n\nTherefore,\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) =1/20 -5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144.\n\nThus,\n\nu\u00b2 [1/20 -5/(6 y\u00b2) -5/144 ] =1.\n\nThis seems complicated, perhaps there is a better way. Let me try to set variables in terms of parameters. Let me suppose that point A is (x,y), then point C is (-x,-y). Then, the other diagonal BD is such that points B and D are (u,v) and (-u,-v). The condition xu + yv=0 must hold. So the coordinates of B must satisfy xu + yv =0. Since B is on the hyperbola, (u\u00b2)/20 - (v\u00b2)/24 =1. Let me try to express v in terms of u, x, y from the first equation: v = - (xu)/y. Substitute into the hyperbola equation for B:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - [ (x\u00b2 u\u00b2)/y\u00b2 ] /24 =1,\n\nSame as before. Let me write this equation again:\n\nu\u00b2 [1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) ] =1.\n\nLet me denote the term in the bracket as K =1/20 - (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2).\n\nSo K = [ (12 y\u00b2 - 5 x\u00b2 ) ] / (240 y\u00b2 )\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\n1/20 =12/(240)\n\nand (x\u00b2)/(24 y\u00b2) = (10 x\u00b2)/(240 y\u00b2)\n\nWait, perhaps better to get a common denominator:\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = (12 y\u00b2 -5 x\u00b2)/(240 y\u00b2 )\n\nWait, let me compute 1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2):\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator appropriately to get denominator 240 y\u00b2:\n\n1/20 = 12 y\u00b2 / (240 y\u00b2)\n\nx\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = 10 x\u00b2 / (240 y\u00b2)\n\nThus,\n\n1/20 - x\u00b2/(24 y\u00b2) = (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2)/ (240 y\u00b2 )\n\nTherefore,\n\nu\u00b2 * [ (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 ) / (240 y\u00b2 ) ] =1 \u21d2 u\u00b2 = 240 y\u00b2 / (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 )\n\nHmm, so u\u00b2 is expressed in terms of x and y. Then BD\u00b2 is 4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2). Since v= -xu/y, so v\u00b2 =x\u00b2 u\u00b2 / y\u00b2. Therefore,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4(u\u00b2 + x\u00b2 u\u00b2 / y\u00b2 ) =4 u\u00b2 (1 +x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 )\n\nSubstitute u\u00b2 from above:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [240 y\u00b2 / (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 ) ] * (1 +x\u00b2 / y\u00b2 )\n\nLet me compute this expression step by step:\n\nFirst, 1 +x\u00b2/y\u00b2 = (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2)/y\u00b2,\n\nThus,\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 * [240 y\u00b2 / (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 ) ] * ( (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2)/y\u00b2 ) \n\nSimplify:\n\nThe y\u00b2 cancels:\n\nBD\u00b2 =4 *240 / (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 ) * (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 )\n\nSo BD\u00b2 = (960 (y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 )) / (12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 )\n\nNow, from the hyperbola equation for point A: x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 \u21d2 x\u00b2 =20(1 + y\u00b2/24 )\n\nLet me substitute x\u00b2 into the above expression.\n\nFirst, let me compute numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: y\u00b2 +x\u00b2 = y\u00b2 +20(1 + y\u00b2/24 ) = y\u00b2 +20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 = 20 + y\u00b2 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 =20 + (11/6)y\u00b2\n\nDenominator:12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 =12 y\u00b2 -10*(20 + (y\u00b2)/ (24/20) )? Wait, let's compute x\u00b2 properly.\n\nWait x\u00b2 =20*(1 + y\u00b2/24 )=20 + (20 y\u00b2)/24 =20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nTherefore, denominator:12 y\u00b2 -10 x\u00b2 =12 y\u00b2 -10*(20 + (5 y\u00b2)/6 ) =12 y\u00b2 -200 - (50 y\u00b2)/6.\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n12 y\u00b2 = (72 y\u00b2)/6,\n\nso:\n\n(72 y\u00b2)/6 - (50 y\u00b2)/6 -200 = (22 y\u00b2)/6 -200 = (11 y\u00b2)/3 -200.\n\nThus,\n\nDenominator: (11 y\u00b2)/3 -200.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 =960*(20 + (11/6)y\u00b2 ) / [ (11 y\u00b2)/3 -200 ]\n\nLet me simplify numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 20 + (11/6)y\u00b2 = (120 +11 y\u00b2)/6\n\nDenominator: (11 y\u00b2 - 600)/3\n\nTherefore,\n\nBD\u00b2= 960 * [ (120 +11 y\u00b2)/6 ] / [ (11 y\u00b2 -600)/3 ]\n\n= 960 * [ (120 +11 y\u00b2)/6 * 3/(11 y\u00b2 -600) ]\n\n=960 * [ (120 +11 y\u00b2) *3 / (6*(11 y\u00b2 -600)) ]\n\nSimplify 3/6=1/2,\n\n=960 * (120 +11 y\u00b2)/ (2*(11 y\u00b2 -600))\n\n=480*(120 +11 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2=480*(120 +11 y\u00b2)/(11 y\u00b2 -600)\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of this expression. Let me denote z = y\u00b2. Since y\u00b2 can be any positive real number such that the hyperbola equation holds. Since point A is on the hyperbola, x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 \u21d2 x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24), so y can be any real number except where the denominator in BD\u00b2 becomes problematic. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the denominator in the BD\u00b2 expression is 11 y\u00b2 -600. Since in the denominator of the original expression (12 y\u00b2 -10x\u00b2), which after substitution became 11 y\u00b2 /3 -200. So 11 y\u00b2 -600 must not be zero, so 11 y\u00b2 \u2260600 \u21d2 y\u00b2 \u2260600/11 \u224854.545...\n\nAlso, the denominator must not be zero, so 11 y\u00b2 -600 \u22600.\n\nAdditionally, the denominator in the expression for u\u00b2 must be non-zero, so 12 y\u00b2 -10x\u00b2 \u22600. Let me see:\n\n12 y\u00b2 -10x\u00b2 =12 y\u00b2 -10*(20 +5 y\u00b2/6)=12 y\u00b2 -200 - (50 y\u00b2)/6 = same as before, leading to denominator.\n\nSo, as long as y\u00b2 \u2260600/11, that's okay.\n\nNow, to find the minimal BD\u00b2, we can consider BD\u00b2 as a function of z = y\u00b2, where z must satisfy:\n\n1. From hyperbola equation, since x\u00b2 must be positive, but since x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24), this is always positive as long as y\u00b2 is real.\n\n2. The denominator 11 z -600 \u22600 \u21d2 z\u2260600/11.\n\nAdditionally, in the expression for u\u00b2, which is 240 y\u00b2/(12 y\u00b2 -10x\u00b2 ), substituting x\u00b2:\n\nu\u00b2=240 z/(12 z -10*(20 +5 z/6 ))=240 z/(12 z -200 -50 z/6 )\n\nWait, let's compute denominator again:\n\n12 z -10x\u00b2 =12 z -10*(20 + (5 z)/6 ) =12 z -200 - (50 z)/6\n\nWhich is same as before.\n\nSo, the denominator 12 z -10x\u00b2 must have the same sign as the numerator in u\u00b2, since u\u00b2 must be positive. So,\n\n240 z divided by (12 z - (200 +50 z/6 )) must be positive. Let me compute the denominator:\n\n12 z -200 - (50 z)/6 = (72 z - 1200 -50 z)/6 = (22 z -1200)/6.\n\nWait, 12 z is 72 z/6, and 50 z/6 is as is. So:\n\n12 z =72 z/6,\n\nSo:\n\nDenominator: 72 z/6 -200 -50 z/6 = (72 z -50 z)/6 -200 = (22 z)/6 -200 = (11 z)/3 -200.\n\nTherefore denominator of u\u00b2 is (11 z)/3 -200, so for u\u00b2 to be positive, (11 z)/3 -200 must have the same sign as 240 z. Since 240 z is positive (z is positive), so (11 z)/3 -200 must be positive. So,\n\n(11 z)/3 -200 >0 \u21d2 11 z >600 \u21d2 z>600/11\u224854.545.\n\nTherefore, z must be greater than 600/11. So the domain of z is z>600/11.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 is a function of z where z>600/11, and BD\u00b2=480*(120 +11 z)/(11 z -600).\n\nWe can write this as BD\u00b2(z)=480*(120 +11 z)/(11 z -600). Let me see if we can simplify this expression:\n\nLet me factor numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: 120 +11 z =11 z +120\n\nDenominator:11 z -600\n\nLet me write BD\u00b2(z)=480*(11 z +120)/(11 z -600)\n\nLet me perform the division:\n\nLet me write numerator as 11 z -600 + 720,\n\nBecause 11 z -600 +720=11 z +120,\n\nSo,\n\nBD\u00b2(z)=480*( (11 z -600) +720 )/(11 z -600) =480*[1 + 720/(11 z -600)]\n\nTherefore,\n\nBD\u00b2(z)=480 + 480*(720)/(11 z -600)=480 + (480*720)/(11 z -600)\n\nHmm, so BD\u00b2(z)=480 + (345600)/(11 z -600)\n\nNow, since z>600/11, then 11 z -600 is positive, so the term (345600)/(11 z -600) is positive. Therefore, BD\u00b2(z)=480 + something positive. So the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when the second term is minimized, which occurs when (11 z -600) is maximized. Wait, but as z increases, 11 z -600 increases, so 345600/(11 z -600) decreases. Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is when z approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. But can z be made arbitrarily large?\n\nWait, but as z approaches infinity, the term 345600/(11 z -600) approaches zero, so BD\u00b2 approaches 480. However, z is y\u00b2, so as y\u00b2 increases, does that correspond to a valid point on the hyperbola?\n\nYes, because the hyperbola extends to infinity. So in theory, as z increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480 from above. Therefore, the infimum of BD\u00b2 is 480, but it is never actually reached because that would require z to be infinity. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480, since BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to 480 but never actually be less than or equal to it. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So since BD\u00b2 can approach 480, but never actually be less than 480, then 480 is the infimum, so the answer is 480. \n\nWait but in the earlier case where we set \u03c6=-\u03b8 and got BD\u00b2=960, that seems contradictory. Wait, but perhaps that case was a specific instance, but there are other cases where BD\u00b2 is smaller? Wait, but according to this analysis, BD\u00b2 can approach 480. So maybe my earlier assumption with \u03c6=-\u03b8 gives a specific case but there are other configurations where BD\u00b2 can be smaller.\n\nWait, let me check with z approaching infinity. Let me see.\n\nSuppose z is very large, so y\u00b2 is very large. Then, point A is (x,y) where x\u00b2=20(1 + y\u00b2/24). So as y becomes large, x\u2248 sqrt(20*(y\u00b2/24)) = y*sqrt(20/24)=y*sqrt(5/6). So coordinates of A are approximately (y*sqrt(5/6), y). Then, the condition xu + yv=0 must be satisfied. Let me see, with B's coordinates (u, v). Since u and v are related through the hyperbola equation.\n\nIf we take y to be very large, then x\u2248 sqrt(5/6) y. So xu + yv \u2248 sqrt(5/6) y u + y v = y( sqrt(5/6) u + v )=0 \u21d2 sqrt(5/6) u + v=0 \u21d2 v= - sqrt(5/6) u.\n\nThen, plugging into the hyperbola equation for B:\n\nu\u00b2/20 - v\u00b2/24 =1 \u21d2 u\u00b2/20 - ( (5/6) u\u00b2 )/24 =1 \u21d2 u\u00b2/20 - (5 u\u00b2)/(144)=1.\n\nCompute:\n\nLet me find common denominator 720:\n\n(36 u\u00b2)/720 - (25 u\u00b2)/720 = (11 u\u00b2)/720 =1 \u21d2 u\u00b2=720/11 \u21d2 u= sqrt(720/11). So v= -sqrt(5/6)*sqrt(720/11).\n\nThen BD\u00b2=4(u\u00b2 + v\u00b2)=4(u\u00b2 + (5/6)u\u00b2)=4*(11/6 u\u00b2)= (22/3)*u\u00b2= (22/3)*(720/11)= (22/3)*(720/11)= (2/3)*(720)= 480. So in the limit as z approaches infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So the infimum is indeed 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480. So the answer is 480. Wait, but in the case where we set \u03c6 = -\u03b8, we found BD\u00b2=960, which is much larger, so that's just one case, but there are other cases where BD\u00b2 can be made as small as approaching 480. Therefore, the minimal possible BD\u00b2 is approaching 480, so the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480. \n\nBut let me check with another example. Let me choose a very large y. Let me pick y\u00b2= 600/11 +\u03b5, where \u03b5 is small, so z just slightly above 600/11. Let me set z=600/11 +1. So z= (600 +11)/11=611/11\u224855.545. Wait, but earlier we had that z must be greater than 600/11\u224854.545, so 55.545 is okay. Then compute BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2(z)=480*(120 +11 z)/(11 z -600)\n\nPlugging in z=611/11:\n\n11 z=611,\n\n120 +11 z=120+611=731,\n\n11 z -600=11,\n\nSo BD\u00b2=480*(731)/11\u2248480*66.454\u2248480*66 +480*0.454\u224831680 + 217.9\u224831897.9. Wait, that's not approaching 480. Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Wait, what did I do wrong here?\n\nWait, perhaps my substitution was incorrect. Wait, z is y\u00b2. Wait, if z=600/11 + \u03b5, then 11 z -600=11*(600/11 +\u03b5) -600=600 +11\u03b5 -600=11\u03b5. So when z approaches 600/11 from above, 11 z -600 approaches 0, so BD\u00b2(z)=480*(120 +11 z)/(11 z -600) would approach infinity. Wait, that's the opposite. So when z approaches 600/11 from above, BD\u00b2 goes to infinity. When z increases to infinity, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So the function BD\u00b2(z) has a horizontal asymptote at 480 as z\u2192infty, and as z approaches 600/11 from above, BD\u00b2 approaches infinity. Therefore, the minimal value of BD\u00b2 is indeed 480, approached as z\u2192infty. So, in that case, the infimum is 480, so the answer should be 480.\n\nWait, but when I took z=611/11\u224855.545, which is just above 600/11\u224854.545, the BD\u00b2 was very large. But when I take z=1000, which is much larger, then BD\u00b2(z)=480*(120 +11*1000)/(11*1000 -600)=480*(120+11000)/(11000-600)=480*(11120)/10400\u2248480*(1.069)=\u2248513. So it's decreasing towards 480. \n\nWait, let me compute with z=1000:\n\nNumerator:120 +11*1000=11120,\n\nDenominator:11*1000-600=11000-600=10400,\n\n11120/10400=1.06923,\n\nSo 480*1.06923\u2248513. So BD\u00b2\u2248513, which is closer to 480.\n\nAt z=10000:\n\nBD\u00b2(z)=480*(120 +110000)/(110000 -600)=480*(110120)/(109400)=480*(1.0066)=\u2248483.168, getting closer to 480.\n\nSo yes, as z increases, BD\u00b2 approaches 480. Therefore, the minimal value is 480, so the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. Therefore, the answer is 480. \n\nBut let me confirm with another approach. Suppose we let variables approach infinity such that BD\u00b2 approaches 480. So in that case, the minimal possible value is 480, so the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". Since BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily close to 480, but never less than 480, then 480 is the infimum. So the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. Because any number greater than 480 would not be less than all BD\u00b2 (since BD\u00b2 can be 480.0001, so 480.0002 would not be less than that). So the supremum of all numbers less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. So the answer is 480. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 480. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n\n\nGiven the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) and a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we need to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\n\n1. **Properties of the Rhombus**:\n   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.\n   - The coordinates of the vertices \\(A, B, C, D\\) are such that if \\(A = (p, q)\\), then \\(C = (-p, -q)\\), and if \\(B = (r, s)\\), then \\(D = (-r, -s)\\).\n\n2. **Hyperbola Equations**:\n   - For point \\(A = (p, q)\\): \\(\\frac{p^2}{20} - \\frac{q^2}{24} = 1\\).\n   - For point \\(B = (r, s)\\): \\(\\frac{r^2}{20} - \\frac{s^2}{24} = 1\\).\n\n3. **Perpendicular Diagonals**:\n   - The product of the slopes of the diagonals must be \\(-1\\), leading to the condition \\(pr + qs = 0\\).\n\n4. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - The distance \\(BD\\) is given by \\(2\\sqrt{r^2 + s^2}\\), so \\(BD^2 = 4(r^2 + s^2)\\).\n\n5. **Parametrization and Simplification**:\n   - Using parametric forms for hyperbola points and substituting into the conditions, we derived expressions for \\(BD^2\\) in terms of parameters.\n   - After simplification, we found that \\(BD^2\\) can be expressed as \\(480 + \\frac{345600}{11z - 600}\\) where \\(z = y^2\\).\n\n6. **Analysis of \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - As \\(z\\) (the square of the \\(y\\)-coordinate of point \\(A\\)) approaches infinity, \\(BD^2\\) approaches 480.\n   - The minimal value of \\(BD^2\\) is therefore the infimum, which is 480, as \\(BD^2\\) can get arbitrarily close to 480 but never less than it.\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a rhombus ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay. Let me start thinking through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, actually, no, not necessarily right angles unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. Is that correct? Let me confirm. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the point where they intersect, which here is the origin, is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, that means if A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, then the origin is the midpoint of AC. Similarly for B and D on the other diagonal.\n\nGiven that the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, so this is a hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally. The transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis along the y-axis.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the vertices of the rhombus are placed symmetrically with respect to the origin. Let me denote the coordinates of the points. Let me suppose that points A and C are on one diagonal, and B and D on the other. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, if A is (a, b), then C must be (-a, -b). Similarly, if B is (c, d), then D is (-c, -d). \n\nBut since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. Hmm, but maybe I can use the properties of the diagonals. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. Wait, maybe I can parametrize the points?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of coordinates. Let me let the diagonals be AC and BD. Let me suppose that AC is along some line, and BD is perpendicular to it. Since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps the diagonals are aligned along the coordinate axes? Wait, but the hyperbola is not symmetric with respect to the y-axis in the same way as the x-axis. Wait, actually, the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes. So, maybe the diagonals can be along the axes. But the problem says \"the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, maybe BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily large, but we have to find the supremum? Wait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\", so it's like the infimum of BD\u00b2? Wait, no, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, in other words, find the least upper bound for BD\u00b2? Because we need the maximum value that is still less than all possible BD\u00b2? Wait, that wording is confusing. Wait, actually, the question is asking for the greatest real number M such that M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi ABCD. So, M is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi? Wait, no. Wait, the greatest M such that M is less than all BD\u00b2. So, M is the infimum of BD\u00b2, but since it has to be less than all BD\u00b2, the supremum of such M would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Hmm, maybe. Let me parse the question again.\n\n\"The greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the number M must satisfy M < BD\u00b2 for every rhombus ABCD. So, the maximum such M would be the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi. So, we need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and then the greatest M less than all BD\u00b2 is that minimal BD\u00b2. Wait, but actually, if BD\u00b2 can get as small as some value, then the greatest M less than all BD\u00b2 would be approaching that minimal value. But maybe BD\u00b2 can't actually reach that minimal value? Hmm, maybe the minimal BD\u00b2 is the answer. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, so that any BD\u00b2 is greater than or equal to that minimal value, so the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum, which is the minimal value. Hmm, maybe. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, so the infimum is the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and the question wants the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2, which would be the infimum. So, perhaps we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, so that the answer is that minimal value. Maybe I need to compute the minimal possible BD squared given the constraints.\n\nSo, let me try to model this. Let me denote the coordinates of the four points. Let me suppose that the diagonals are AC and BD. Since they bisect each other at the origin, then coordinates of A and C are (a, b) and (-a, -b), and coordinates of B and D are (c, d) and (-c, -d). Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, so they must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, for point A: (a)^2/20 - (b)^2/24 =1,\n\nSimilarly for point B: (c)^2/20 - (d)^2/24 =1.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, DA must be equal.\n\nAlternatively, since in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. The vector AC is (2a, 2b), and BD is (2c, 2d). Wait, actually, the vectors from the origin to A is (a,b), so the diagonal AC is from A to C, which is from (a,b) to (-a, -b), so the vector is (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is from (c,d) to (-c, -d), so vector is (-2c, -2d). But the diagonals are perpendicular, so their dot product should be zero. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. So, (vector AC) \u2022 (vector BD) =0.\n\nWait, actually, the vectors of the diagonals themselves. Let me think again. The diagonals are AC and BD. The vectors representing these diagonals are from A to C and from B to D. Wait, but since the diagonals cross at the origin, which is their midpoint, perhaps the vectors from the origin to the points can be used. Let me see:\n\nThe diagonal AC goes from A(a,b) to C(-a,-b), so the vector is (-2a, -2b). The diagonal BD goes from B(c,d) to D(-c,-d), so the vector is (-2c, -2d). The diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero. So:\n\n(-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) =0 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the vectors AC and BD are (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d). Their dot product is:\n\n(-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 4ac +4bd =0.\n\nTherefore, ac + bd =0. So, that's one condition.\n\nAdditionally, since the sides of the rhombus are equal. Let me think about the sides. For example, the length of AB should equal the length of BC, etc. Let me compute the distance between A(a,b) and B(c,d). The distance squared is (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2. Similarly, the distance between B(c,d) and C(-a,-b) squared is (c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2. Since it's a rhombus, these should be equal. So:\n\n(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 = (c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2)\n\nRight side: (c\u00b2 + 2ac + a\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2)\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n[ (c\u00b2 + 2ac + a\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2) ] - [ (a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2) ]\n\n= (2ac + 2bd) - (-2ac -2bd)\n\n= 2ac +2bd +2ac +2bd\n\n=4ac +4bd.\n\nSet equal to zero because the sides must be equal:\n\nSo 4ac +4bd =0, which simplifies to ac + bd =0, which is the same condition as before. Hmm, so that's redundant. So that condition is already given by the diagonals being perpendicular. So maybe the only condition we need is ac + bd =0, along with the points lying on the hyperbola.\n\nTherefore, the key equations are:\n\nFor points A(a, b): a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nFor points B(c, d): c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nAnd the condition ac + bd =0.\n\nWe need to find BD squared. BD is the distance between B(c,d) and D(-c,-d), so BD squared is (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 =4c\u00b2 +4d\u00b2. So BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, we need to find the minimal value of 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), given the constraints above. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, perhaps the minimal BD squared is the minimal possible value, so the answer is that minimal value? Because the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum, which is the minimal BD\u00b2 if it's attainable. Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe BD\u00b2 can be made as small as possible but there's a lower bound. Let me see.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) given that c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1 and ac + bd =0, along with a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1. But since A and B are arbitrary points on the hyperbola with those conditions, perhaps we need to express variables in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola such that the conditions are satisfied. Let me see.\n\nLet me think of variables a, b, c, d with those constraints. Let me see if I can express variables in terms of parameters.\n\nFirst, for hyperbola points, maybe parametrize using hyperbolic functions. The standard parametrization for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1 is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). So here, for our hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, we can write points as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Let me check:\n\nIf x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, then x\u00b2 =20 sec\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nand y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8, so y\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nthen x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = sec\u00b2\u03b8 - tan\u00b2\u03b8 =1, which works. So that's a valid parametrization.\n\nSimilarly, another point can be parametrized with a different angle. Let me suppose that point A is (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8) and point B is (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6). Then points C and D are (-sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, -sqrt(24) tan\u03b8) and (-sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, -sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular is ac + bd =0. Let me plug in the coordinates.\n\nHere, a = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8,\n\nb = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8,\n\nc = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6,\n\nd = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, ac + bd = sqrt(20)*sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24)*sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, a*c is (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8)(sqrt(20) sec\u03c6) =20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6,\n\nSimilarly, b*d is (sqrt(24) tan\u03b8)(sqrt(24) tan\u03c6)=24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6,\n\nTherefore, the condition is 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nHmm, that's the equation we have to satisfy.\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can manipulate this equation.\n\nFirst, note that sec\u03b8 =1/cos\u03b8, and tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8. Let me rewrite the equation in terms of sine and cosine:\n\n20*(1/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6)) +24*( (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) ) =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n20 +24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0,\n\nTherefore,\n\n24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20,\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, okay. So that's a key equation: sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, given that, we need to find BD squared. Let me recall BD squared is 4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nCompute c\u00b2 +d\u00b2:\n\nc is sqrt(20) sec\u03c6,\n\nso c\u00b2 =20 sec\u00b2\u03c6,\n\nd is sqrt(24) tan\u03c6,\n\nso d\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03c6,\n\nThus,\n\nc\u00b2 +d\u00b2 =20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, let me simplify that expression:\n\nWe can use the identity sec\u00b2\u03c6 =1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6,\n\nTherefore,\n\n20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 =20 +20 tan\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 =20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 =4*(20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03c6) =80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, so BD squared is expressed in terms of tan\u03c6. But we also have the relation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, but how do we relate \u03b8 and \u03c6?\n\nWe need another equation. Wait, perhaps there are more constraints? Let me think.\n\nWait, points A and B are arbitrary points on the hyperbola, but with the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the only constraint between \u03b8 and \u03c6 is sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. So, \u03b8 and \u03c6 can be any angles such that this holds.\n\nBut we need to find BD squared in terms of \u03c6, but perhaps we can express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8, or find a way to minimize BD squared over all possible \u03b8 and \u03c6 satisfying sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parameterize one variable in terms of the other. Let me suppose that \u03b8 is a variable, then \u03c6 must satisfy sin\u03c6 = (-5/(6 sin\u03b8)). But sin\u03c6 must be between -1 and 1, so |sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6|=5/6 <= |sin\u03b8|*1, so |sin\u03b8| >=5/6. Therefore, sin\u03b8 must satisfy |sin\u03b8| >=5/6.\n\nSimilarly, since sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, so sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8). So, for this to be valid, |sin\u03c6| <=1, so | -5/(6 sin\u03b8)| <=1, so |sin\u03b8| >=5/6. Which is consistent with above.\n\nTherefore, sin\u03b8 must be in [-1, -5/6] or [5/6,1].\n\nTherefore, \u03b8 must be in the range where |sin\u03b8| >=5/6.\n\nNow, let's see if we can express BD squared in terms of \u03b8. Let me see.\n\nWe have BD squared is 80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6. But we can express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8.\n\nSince sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8),\n\nLet me compute tan\u00b2\u03c6:\n\ntan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6,\n\nSo tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo, sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8). Therefore,\n\nsin\u00b2\u03c6 =25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8),\n\nso,\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [1 -25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)].\n\nLet me compute denominator:\n\n1 -25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nThus,\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ]\n\nThe denominators cancel:\n\n=25 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nTherefore,\n\nBD squared =80 +176 * [25 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD squared =80 + (176 *25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)\n\n=80 + 4400/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)\n\nHmm, okay, so BD squared is expressed in terms of sin\u00b2\u03b8. Let me denote s = sin\u00b2\u03b8. Since |sin\u03b8| >=5/6, then s >=25/36.\n\nSo, s is in [25/36,1].\n\nTherefore, BD squared becomes:\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 + 4400/(36 s -25)\n\nWe need to find the minimal BD squared. Since we want the minimal value of BD squared, because the question is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would be the infimum, which is the minimal value.\n\nTherefore, to find the minimal BD squared, we need to minimize the expression 80 +4400/(36s -25) over s in [25/36,1].\n\nLet me analyze the function f(s)=80 +4400/(36s -25).\n\nFirst, note that as s increases, the denominator 36s -25 increases, so 4400/(36s -25) decreases. Therefore, f(s) is a decreasing function of s. Therefore, the minimal value of f(s) occurs at the maximal s, which is s=1.\n\nWait, but wait, hold on. Wait, if s is in [25/36,1], then the minimal BD squared is when s is maximum (s=1), since f(s) decreases as s increases. Therefore, the minimal BD squared is f(1)=80 +4400/(36*1 -25)=80 +4400/(11)=80 +400=480.\n\nWait, so BD squared can be as low as 480?\n\nWait, but let me check that. If s=1, then sin\u03b8=\u00b11. Let's see if that is allowed. If sin\u03b8=1, then sin\u03c6 = -5/(6*1)= -5/6, so that's okay. Similarly, sin\u03b8=-1 would give sin\u03c6=5/6, which is also okay. So s=1 is allowed.\n\nTherefore, BD squared can be as low as 480. But then, if s approaches 25/36 from above, then the denominator 36s -25 approaches 36*(25/36) -25=25 -25=0, so the term 4400/(36s -25) approaches infinity. Therefore, BD squared can get arbitrarily large. Therefore, the minimal BD squared is 480, and the maximum BD squared is infinity. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD squared for all such rhombi would be 480, since BD squared can get as low as 480, so any number less than 480 would not be \"less than BD squared for all rhombi\", because when BD squared is 480, numbers greater than 480 would not satisfy. Wait, actually, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then the greatest number that is less than all BD\u00b2 must be 480 itself, but since 480 is actually attainable, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be just below 480. However, since we are to give an integer, maybe 480 is the infimum, so the answer is 480. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". Since BD\u00b2 can equal 480, the number 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because when BD\u00b2 is exactly 480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2. Therefore, the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since it's not actually attained, but approached as s approaches 1. Wait, no, actually when s=1, BD squared is exactly 480, so there exists a rhombus with BD squared exactly 480, so the number 480 is not less than BD squared for all rhombi (since it's equal for some). Therefore, the answer must be just below 480, but since we need an integer, perhaps 480 is the minimal value, so the question might actually be looking for 480. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, let me read again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, in other words, find the supremum of all real numbers M such that M < BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus. The supremum would be the minimal BD\u00b2, since BD\u00b2 can get as low as 480, so the supremum of such M is 480. Because for any M <480, there exists a rhombus (the one with BD\u00b2=480) where BD\u00b2 is not greater than M. Wait, no, actually if M is less than 480, then M is less than BD\u00b2=480. Wait, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, the supremum of all M such that M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because if the infimum is 480, then any M less than 480 would satisfy M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi (since BD\u00b2 is always at least 480). But the greatest such M is the infimum, which is 480. However, since 480 is actually attained, the supremum of all M less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because you can approach it as close as you like from below. Wait, but technically, the supremum of all M where M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because if you take M=480 - \u03b5 for any \u03b5>0, then that M is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but 480 itself is not less than BD\u00b2 when BD\u00b2=480. Therefore, the supremum is 480, even though it's not attained. So, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, so the answer is 480. Since it's the infimum, and even though it's achieved, but since the question says \"less than\", perhaps it's not 480. Wait, but if it's achieved, then the answer must be just below 480, but since the question says \"greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\", the number 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would have to be less than 480, but there is no such greatest number, since you can approach 480 as close as you like. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the minimal BD squared, which is 480, even though strictly speaking the wording says \"less than\". Maybe in the problem's context, they consider 480 as the minimal value, so the answer is 480. Let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose when BD\u00b2 is 480, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would have to be less than 480, but since there are rhombi with BD\u00b2 exactly 480, you can't have a number that is less than all BD\u00b2 and greater than or equal to 480. Therefore the supremum of all such M is 480, even though it's not attained. So in mathematical terms, the answer is 480. Since the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\", which is exactly the infimum of BD\u00b2. Since the infimum is 480, then that's the answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480. Let me confirm the calculation again.\n\nWe had BD squared = 80 + 4400/(36 s -25), where s is sin\u00b2\u03b8 in [25/36,1].\n\nAt s=1,\n\nBD squared =80 + 4400/(36 -25)=80 +4400/11=80+400=480. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible BD squared is 480, so the greatest real number less than all BD squared is 480. Since the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\", even though 480 is achieved, but the wording might be intending the infimum, which is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 480, so boxed, it's \\boxed{480}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about a rhombus ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, and the diagonals intersect at the origin. I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Hmm, okay. Let me start thinking through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Wait, actually, no, not necessarily right angles unless it's a square. Wait, no, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals do bisect each other at right angles. Is that correct? Let me confirm. Yes, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. So, the point where they intersect, which here is the origin, is the midpoint of both diagonals. So, that means if A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, then the origin is the midpoint of AC. Similarly for B and D on the other diagonal.\n\nGiven that the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, so this is a hyperbola centered at the origin, opening horizontally. The transverse axis is along the x-axis, and the conjugate axis along the y-axis.\n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is the center of the hyperbola, that makes sense. So, the vertices of the rhombus are placed symmetrically with respect to the origin. Let me denote the coordinates of the points. Let me suppose that points A and C are on one diagonal, and B and D on the other. Since the diagonals bisect each other at the origin, if A is (a, b), then C must be (-a, -b). Similarly, if B is (c, d), then D is (-c, -d). \n\nBut since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. Hmm, but maybe I can use the properties of the diagonals. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. Wait, maybe I can parametrize the points?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to think in terms of coordinates. Let me let the diagonals be AC and BD. Let me suppose that AC is along some line, and BD is perpendicular to it. Since the hyperbola is symmetric, perhaps the diagonals are aligned along the coordinate axes? Wait, but the hyperbola is not symmetric with respect to the y-axis in the same way as the x-axis. Wait, actually, the hyperbola is symmetric with respect to both axes. So, maybe the diagonals can be along the axes. But the problem says \"the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, maybe BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily large, but we have to find the supremum? Wait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\", so it's like the infimum of BD\u00b2? Wait, no, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, in other words, find the least upper bound for BD\u00b2? Because we need the maximum value that is still less than all possible BD\u00b2? Wait, that wording is confusing. Wait, actually, the question is asking for the greatest real number M such that M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi ABCD. So, M is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi? Wait, no. Wait, the greatest M such that M is less than all BD\u00b2. So, M is the infimum of BD\u00b2, but since it has to be less than all BD\u00b2, the supremum of such M would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Hmm, maybe. Let me parse the question again.\n\n\"The greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, the number M must satisfy M < BD\u00b2 for every rhombus ABCD. So, the maximum such M would be the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi. So, we need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and then the greatest M less than all BD\u00b2 is that minimal BD\u00b2. Wait, but actually, if BD\u00b2 can get as small as some value, then the greatest M less than all BD\u00b2 would be approaching that minimal value. But maybe BD\u00b2 can't actually reach that minimal value? Hmm, maybe the minimal BD\u00b2 is the answer. Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, so that any BD\u00b2 is greater than or equal to that minimal value, so the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum, which is the minimal value. Hmm, maybe. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 can be made arbitrarily large, so the infimum is the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and the question wants the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2, which would be the infimum. So, perhaps we need to find the minimal BD\u00b2, so that the answer is that minimal value. Maybe I need to compute the minimal possible BD squared given the constraints.\n\nSo, let me try to model this. Let me denote the coordinates of the four points. Let me suppose that the diagonals are AC and BD. Since they bisect each other at the origin, then coordinates of A and C are (a, b) and (-a, -b), and coordinates of B and D are (c, d) and (-c, -d). Since all four points lie on the hyperbola, so they must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo, for point A: (a)^2/20 - (b)^2/24 =1,\n\nSimilarly for point B: (c)^2/20 - (d)^2/24 =1.\n\nSince it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. So, the lengths of AB, BC, CD, DA must be equal.\n\nAlternatively, since in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. The vector AC is (2a, 2b), and BD is (2c, 2d). Wait, actually, the vectors from the origin to A is (a,b), so the diagonal AC is from A to C, which is from (a,b) to (-a, -b), so the vector is (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is from (c,d) to (-c, -d), so vector is (-2c, -2d). But the diagonals are perpendicular, so their dot product should be zero. So, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. So, (vector AC) \u2022 (vector BD) =0.\n\nWait, actually, the vectors of the diagonals themselves. Let me think again. The diagonals are AC and BD. The vectors representing these diagonals are from A to C and from B to D. Wait, but since the diagonals cross at the origin, which is their midpoint, perhaps the vectors from the origin to the points can be used. Let me see:\n\nThe diagonal AC goes from A(a,b) to C(-a,-b), so the vector is (-2a, -2b). The diagonal BD goes from B(c,d) to D(-c,-d), so the vector is (-2c, -2d). The diagonals are perpendicular, so the dot product of vectors AC and BD should be zero. So:\n\n(-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) =0 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the vectors AC and BD are (-2a, -2b) and (-2c, -2d). Their dot product is:\n\n(-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 4ac +4bd =0.\n\nTherefore, ac + bd =0. So, that's one condition.\n\nAdditionally, since the sides of the rhombus are equal. Let me think about the sides. For example, the length of AB should equal the length of BC, etc. Let me compute the distance between A(a,b) and B(c,d). The distance squared is (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2. Similarly, the distance between B(c,d) and C(-a,-b) squared is (c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2. Since it's a rhombus, these should be equal. So:\n\n(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 = (c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2)\n\nRight side: (c\u00b2 + 2ac + a\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2)\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n[ (c\u00b2 + 2ac + a\u00b2) + (d\u00b2 + 2bd + b\u00b2) ] - [ (a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2) ]\n\n= (2ac + 2bd) - (-2ac -2bd)\n\n= 2ac +2bd +2ac +2bd\n\n=4ac +4bd.\n\nSet equal to zero because the sides must be equal:\n\nSo 4ac +4bd =0, which simplifies to ac + bd =0, which is the same condition as before. Hmm, so that's redundant. So that condition is already given by the diagonals being perpendicular. So maybe the only condition we need is ac + bd =0, along with the points lying on the hyperbola.\n\nTherefore, the key equations are:\n\nFor points A(a, b): a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nFor points B(c, d): c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nAnd the condition ac + bd =0.\n\nWe need to find BD squared. BD is the distance between B(c,d) and D(-c,-d), so BD squared is (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 =4c\u00b2 +4d\u00b2. So BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So, we need to find the minimal value of 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), given the constraints above. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, perhaps the minimal BD squared is the minimal possible value, so the answer is that minimal value? Because the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum, which is the minimal BD\u00b2 if it's attainable. Hmm, maybe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe BD\u00b2 can be made as small as possible but there's a lower bound. Let me see.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) given that c\u00b2/20 - d\u00b2/24 =1 and ac + bd =0, along with a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1. But since A and B are arbitrary points on the hyperbola with those conditions, perhaps we need to express variables in terms of each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B on the hyperbola such that the conditions are satisfied. Let me see.\n\nLet me think of variables a, b, c, d with those constraints. Let me see if I can express variables in terms of parameters.\n\nFirst, for hyperbola points, maybe parametrize using hyperbolic functions. The standard parametrization for hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1 is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). So here, for our hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, we can write points as (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8). Let me check:\n\nIf x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, then x\u00b2 =20 sec\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nand y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8, so y\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nthen x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = sec\u00b2\u03b8 - tan\u00b2\u03b8 =1, which works. So that's a valid parametrization.\n\nSimilarly, another point can be parametrized with a different angle. Let me suppose that point A is (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8) and point B is (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6). Then points C and D are (-sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, -sqrt(24) tan\u03b8) and (-sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, -sqrt(24) tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular is ac + bd =0. Let me plug in the coordinates.\n\nHere, a = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8,\n\nb = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8,\n\nc = sqrt(20) sec\u03c6,\n\nd = sqrt(24) tan\u03c6.\n\nSo, ac + bd = sqrt(20)*sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + sqrt(24)*sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, a*c is (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8)(sqrt(20) sec\u03c6) =20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6,\n\nSimilarly, b*d is (sqrt(24) tan\u03b8)(sqrt(24) tan\u03c6)=24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6,\n\nTherefore, the condition is 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nHmm, that's the equation we have to satisfy.\n\nSo, 20 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +24 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0.\n\nHmm, that looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can manipulate this equation.\n\nFirst, note that sec\u03b8 =1/cos\u03b8, and tan\u03b8 = sin\u03b8/cos\u03b8. Let me rewrite the equation in terms of sine and cosine:\n\n20*(1/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6)) +24*( (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) ) =0.\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6:\n\n20 +24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0,\n\nTherefore,\n\n24 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20,\n\nSo,\n\nsin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -20/24 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, okay. So that's a key equation: sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nSo, given that, we need to find BD squared. Let me recall BD squared is 4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nCompute c\u00b2 +d\u00b2:\n\nc is sqrt(20) sec\u03c6,\n\nso c\u00b2 =20 sec\u00b2\u03c6,\n\nd is sqrt(24) tan\u03c6,\n\nso d\u00b2=24 tan\u00b2\u03c6,\n\nThus,\n\nc\u00b2 +d\u00b2 =20 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, let me simplify that expression:\n\nWe can use the identity sec\u00b2\u03c6 =1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6,\n\nTherefore,\n\n20(1 + tan\u00b2\u03c6) +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 =20 +20 tan\u00b2\u03c6 +24 tan\u00b2\u03c6 =20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 =4*(20 +44 tan\u00b2\u03c6) =80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, so BD squared is expressed in terms of tan\u03c6. But we also have the relation sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, but how do we relate \u03b8 and \u03c6?\n\nWe need another equation. Wait, perhaps there are more constraints? Let me think.\n\nWait, points A and B are arbitrary points on the hyperbola, but with the condition that the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the only constraint between \u03b8 and \u03c6 is sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. So, \u03b8 and \u03c6 can be any angles such that this holds.\n\nBut we need to find BD squared in terms of \u03c6, but perhaps we can express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of \u03b8, or find a way to minimize BD squared over all possible \u03b8 and \u03c6 satisfying sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parameterize one variable in terms of the other. Let me suppose that \u03b8 is a variable, then \u03c6 must satisfy sin\u03c6 = (-5/(6 sin\u03b8)). But sin\u03c6 must be between -1 and 1, so |sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6|=5/6 <= |sin\u03b8|*1, so |sin\u03b8| >=5/6. Therefore, sin\u03b8 must satisfy |sin\u03b8| >=5/6.\n\nSimilarly, since sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6, so sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8). So, for this to be valid, |sin\u03c6| <=1, so | -5/(6 sin\u03b8)| <=1, so |sin\u03b8| >=5/6. Which is consistent with above.\n\nTherefore, sin\u03b8 must be in [-1, -5/6] or [5/6,1].\n\nTherefore, \u03b8 must be in the range where |sin\u03b8| >=5/6.\n\nNow, let's see if we can express BD squared in terms of \u03b8. Let me see.\n\nWe have BD squared is 80 +176 tan\u00b2\u03c6. But we can express tan\u00b2\u03c6 in terms of sin\u03b8.\n\nSince sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8),\n\nLet me compute tan\u00b2\u03c6:\n\ntan\u03c6 = sin\u03c6 / cos\u03c6,\n\nSo tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / (1 - sin\u00b2\u03c6).\n\nSo, sin\u03c6 = -5/(6 sin\u03b8). Therefore,\n\nsin\u00b2\u03c6 =25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8),\n\nso,\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [1 -25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)].\n\nLet me compute denominator:\n\n1 -25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) = (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8).\n\nThus,\n\ntan\u00b2\u03c6 = [25/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8)] / [ (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8) ) ]\n\nThe denominators cancel:\n\n=25 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25).\n\nTherefore,\n\nBD squared =80 +176 * [25 / (36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25) ]\n\nSo,\n\nBD squared =80 + (176 *25)/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)\n\n=80 + 4400/(36 sin\u00b2\u03b8 -25)\n\nHmm, okay, so BD squared is expressed in terms of sin\u00b2\u03b8. Let me denote s = sin\u00b2\u03b8. Since |sin\u03b8| >=5/6, then s >=25/36.\n\nSo, s is in [25/36,1].\n\nTherefore, BD squared becomes:\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 + 4400/(36 s -25)\n\nWe need to find the minimal BD squared. Since we want the minimal value of BD squared, because the question is asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, which would be the infimum, which is the minimal value.\n\nTherefore, to find the minimal BD squared, we need to minimize the expression 80 +4400/(36s -25) over s in [25/36,1].\n\nLet me analyze the function f(s)=80 +4400/(36s -25).\n\nFirst, note that as s increases, the denominator 36s -25 increases, so 4400/(36s -25) decreases. Therefore, f(s) is a decreasing function of s. Therefore, the minimal value of f(s) occurs at the maximal s, which is s=1.\n\nWait, but wait, hold on. Wait, if s is in [25/36,1], then the minimal BD squared is when s is maximum (s=1), since f(s) decreases as s increases. Therefore, the minimal BD squared is f(1)=80 +4400/(36*1 -25)=80 +4400/(11)=80 +400=480.\n\nWait, so BD squared can be as low as 480?\n\nWait, but let me check that. If s=1, then sin\u03b8=\u00b11. Let's see if that is allowed. If sin\u03b8=1, then sin\u03c6 = -5/(6*1)= -5/6, so that's okay. Similarly, sin\u03b8=-1 would give sin\u03c6=5/6, which is also okay. So s=1 is allowed.\n\nTherefore, BD squared can be as low as 480. But then, if s approaches 25/36 from above, then the denominator 36s -25 approaches 36*(25/36) -25=25 -25=0, so the term 4400/(36s -25) approaches infinity. Therefore, BD squared can get arbitrarily large. Therefore, the minimal BD squared is 480, and the maximum BD squared is infinity. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD squared for all such rhombi would be 480, since BD squared can get as low as 480, so any number less than 480 would not be \"less than BD squared for all rhombi\", because when BD squared is 480, numbers greater than 480 would not satisfy. Wait, actually, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, then the greatest number that is less than all BD\u00b2 must be 480 itself, but since 480 is actually attainable, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be just below 480. However, since we are to give an integer, maybe 480 is the infimum, so the answer is 480. Wait, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". Since BD\u00b2 can equal 480, the number 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, because when BD\u00b2 is exactly 480, 480 is not less than BD\u00b2. Therefore, the supremum of all numbers less than BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, but since it's not actually attained, but approached as s approaches 1. Wait, no, actually when s=1, BD squared is exactly 480, so there exists a rhombus with BD squared exactly 480, so the number 480 is not less than BD squared for all rhombi (since it's equal for some). Therefore, the answer must be just below 480, but since we need an integer, perhaps 480 is the minimal value, so the question might actually be looking for 480. Wait, maybe I misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, let me read again: \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So, in other words, find the supremum of all real numbers M such that M < BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus. The supremum would be the minimal BD\u00b2, since BD\u00b2 can get as low as 480, so the supremum of such M is 480. Because for any M <480, there exists a rhombus (the one with BD\u00b2=480) where BD\u00b2 is not greater than M. Wait, no, actually if M is less than 480, then M is less than BD\u00b2=480. Wait, maybe I need to think again.\n\nWait, the supremum of all M such that M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because if the infimum is 480, then any M less than 480 would satisfy M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi (since BD\u00b2 is always at least 480). But the greatest such M is the infimum, which is 480. However, since 480 is actually attained, the supremum of all M less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480, because you can approach it as close as you like from below. Wait, but technically, the supremum of all M where M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, because if you take M=480 - \u03b5 for any \u03b5>0, then that M is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but 480 itself is not less than BD\u00b2 when BD\u00b2=480. Therefore, the supremum is 480, even though it's not attained. So, the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, so the answer is 480. Since it's the infimum, and even though it's achieved, but since the question says \"less than\", perhaps it's not 480. Wait, but if it's achieved, then the answer must be just below 480, but since the question says \"greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\", the number 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, so the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would have to be less than 480, but there is no such greatest number, since you can approach 480 as close as you like. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, perhaps the problem is expecting the minimal BD squared, which is 480, even though strictly speaking the wording says \"less than\". Maybe in the problem's context, they consider 480 as the minimal value, so the answer is 480. Let me check with an example.\n\nSuppose when BD\u00b2 is 480, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would have to be less than 480, but since there are rhombi with BD\u00b2 exactly 480, you can't have a number that is less than all BD\u00b2 and greater than or equal to 480. Therefore the supremum of all such M is 480, even though it's not attained. So in mathematical terms, the answer is 480. Since the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\", which is exactly the infimum of BD\u00b2. Since the infimum is 480, then that's the answer.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 480. Let me confirm the calculation again.\n\nWe had BD squared = 80 + 4400/(36 s -25), where s is sin\u00b2\u03b8 in [25/36,1].\n\nAt s=1,\n\nBD squared =80 + 4400/(36 -25)=80 +4400/11=80+400=480. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible BD squared is 480, so the greatest real number less than all BD squared is 480. Since the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\", even though 480 is achieved, but the wording might be intending the infimum, which is 480, so the answer is 480.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 480, so boxed, it's \\boxed{480}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n\n\nGiven the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) and a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we need to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\n\n1. **Properties of the Rhombus**:\n   - The diagonals bisect each other at the origin and are perpendicular.\n   - Points \\(A(a, b)\\), \\(B(c, d)\\), \\(C(-a, -b)\\), and \\(D(-c, -d)\\) lie on the hyperbola.\n   - The condition \\(ac + bd = 0\\) must be satisfied for the diagonals to be perpendicular.\n\n2. **Hyperbola Parametrization**:\n   - Points on the hyperbola can be parametrized as \\(A(\\sqrt{20} \\sec\\theta, \\sqrt{24} \\tan\\theta)\\) and \\(B(\\sqrt{20} \\sec\\phi, \\sqrt{24} \\tan\\phi)\\).\n   - Substituting these into the perpendicularity condition \\(ac + bd = 0\\) leads to \\(\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\n3. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - The length \\(BD^2\\) is calculated as \\(4(c^2 + d^2)\\).\n   - Substituting \\(c = \\sqrt{20} \\sec\\phi\\) and \\(d = \\sqrt{24} \\tan\\phi\\), we get:\n     \\[\n     BD^2 = 4 \\left(20 \\sec^2\\phi + 24 \\tan^2\\phi\\right)\n     \\]\n   - Simplifying using trigonometric identities, we find:\n     \\[\n     BD^2 = 80 + 176 \\tan^2\\phi\n     \\]\n\n4. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - Using the relationship \\(\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\), we express \\(\\tan^2\\phi\\) in terms of \\(\\sin\\theta\\).\n   - After simplification, \\(BD^2\\) is found to be:\n     \\[\n     BD^2 = 80 + \\frac{4400}{36 \\sin^2\\theta - 25}\n     \\]\n   - The minimal value occurs when \\(\\sin^2\\theta\\) is maximized (i.e., \\(\\sin^2\\theta = 1\\)), leading to:\n     \\[\n     BD^2 = 80 + \\frac{4400}{11} = 480\n     \\]\n\nThus, the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",
