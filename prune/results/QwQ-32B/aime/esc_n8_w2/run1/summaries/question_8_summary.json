      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward\u2014it's a classic stars and bars problem if there were no other constraints. But here, there's another equation involving the sum of terms like a\u00b2b. That seems more complicated. Let me see if I can manipulate the given equation to find a relationship between a, b, and c.\n\nLooking at the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b, I notice that each term is of the form one variable squared multiplied by another variable. Maybe I can factor this somehow or relate it to other symmetric expressions. Let me think about symmetric sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of (a + b + c) and other symmetric terms. Let me recall that for three variables, there are standard symmetric sums like ab + bc + ca, and abc. Maybe I can relate the given expression to these.\n\nLet me try expanding (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca). Let's compute that:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n= a\u00b2b + abc + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + abc + abc + bc\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\n\nWait, let's count all terms:\n\nFirst term: a(ab) = a\u00b2b\n\nSecond term: a(bc) = abc\n\nThird term: a(ca) = a\u00b2c\n\nFourth term: b(ab) = ab\u00b2\n\nFifth term: b(bc) = b\u00b2c\n\nSixth term: b(ca) = abc\n\nSeventh term: c(ab) = abc\n\nEighth term: c(bc) = bc\u00b2\n\nNinth term: c(ca) = c\u00b2a\n\nSo when we add all these together:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2 + c\u00b2a + 3abc.\n\nTherefore, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 3abc.\n\nOh! The given expression in the problem is exactly the first part of this expansion. So, the given equation can be rewritten as:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nBut we know that a + b + c = 300, so substituting that in:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's a helpful equation. Let me write that down:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nMaybe I can divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me see if I can manipulate this further. Alternatively, maybe I can express abc in terms of ab + bc + ca?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of variables in terms of each other. Since a + b + c = 300, maybe set variables as two variables and express the third in terms of them. For instance, let me let c = 300 - a - b. Then substitute into the equation.\n\nBut that might get messy with three variables. Let me see if there's a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider symmetry. Suppose that two variables are equal. Since the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, maybe the solutions have some symmetry. Let me test that.\n\nSuppose that two variables are equal. Let's say a = b. Then c = 300 - 2a.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nOriginal equation: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000.\n\nSince a = b, this becomes:\n\na\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + a\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2a = 6,000,000\n\nSimplify:\n\n2a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2c + 2a c\u00b2 = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\na\u00b3 + a\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 = 3,000,000.\n\nBut since c = 300 - 2a, substitute that in:\n\na\u00b3 + a\u00b2(300 - 2a) + a(300 - 2a)^2 = 3,000,000.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated but maybe manageable. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: a\u00b3\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2*(300 - 2a) = 300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3\n\nThird term: a*(300 - 2a)^2. Let me expand (300 - 2a)^2 first:\n\n(300)^2 - 2*300*2a + (2a)^2 = 90,000 - 1,200a + 4a\u00b2\n\nTherefore, third term is a*(90,000 - 1,200a + 4a\u00b2) = 90,000a - 1,200a\u00b2 + 4a\u00b3\n\nNow, adding all three terms together:\n\na\u00b3 + (300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3) + (90,000a - 1,200a\u00b2 + 4a\u00b3)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na\u00b3 - 2a\u00b3 + 4a\u00b3 = 3a\u00b3\n\n300a\u00b2 - 1,200a\u00b2 = -900a\u00b2\n\nAnd the linear term is 90,000a.\n\nSo overall:\n\n3a\u00b3 - 900a\u00b2 + 90,000a = 3,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a = 1,000,000.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Maybe factor it? Let's see if there are integer roots. Let me try possible integer values for a. Since a is a nonnegative integer and c = 300 - 2a must also be nonnegative, so 300 - 2a \u2265 0 \u21d2 a \u2264 150. So a can be between 0 and 150.\n\nLet me try a = 100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHey, that works! So a = 100 is a root. Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor. Let me perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division. Let's use synthetic division with root 100.\n\nCoefficients: 1 (a\u00b3), -300 (a\u00b2), 30,000 (a), -1,000,000 (constant term).\n\nSet up synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1 \u00a0 -300 \u00a0 30000 \u00a0 -1000000\n\nStart:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by 100: 1*100 = 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100 = -20,000. Add to 30,000: 10,000.\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100 = 1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000). Let me check the quadratic:\n\na\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000. Let's see if it factors further.\n\nDiscriminant: 200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So it's a perfect square. So the quadratic is (a - 100)^2. Therefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the quadratic factor is a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000. Let's see if that's (a - 100)^2: (a - 100)^2 = a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000. Yes! So the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0. Therefore, the only real root is a = 100 (with multiplicity 3).\n\nTherefore, in this case where a = b, the only solution is a = 100, so then b = 100 and c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100). Let me check if this satisfies the original equation.\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. Since all are 100, each term is 100\u00b2*100 = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms, so total is 6,000,000. Yes, that works. So that's one solution.\n\nBut the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers\", so this is one solution where all three are equal. But are there other solutions where variables are not equal?\n\nHmm. Maybe there are other solutions where two variables are equal, but not all three? Wait, in the case above, when we set a = b, we found only the solution where all three are equal. So perhaps if we set a = b but not equal to c, but in that case, we saw that only a = 100 gives c = 100 as well, so no. So maybe symmetry requires that if two variables are equal, the third must be equal too?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where all variables are different. Let me consider that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the equation we had earlier: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300,\n\nP = abc,\n\nand Q = ab + bc + ca.\n\nSo the equation is 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nBut we also know that for three variables,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo, 300\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2Q.\n\nBut not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, perhaps express Q in terms of other variables?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of two variables. Let me set variables as a, b, and c = 300 - a - b.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nFirst, compute Q = ab + bc + ca.\n\nExpressed in terms of a and b:\n\nab + b*(300 - a - b) + a*(300 - a - b)\n\n= ab + 300b - ab - b\u00b2 + 300a - a\u00b2 - ab\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nFirst term: ab\n\nSecond term: b*c = b*(300 - a - b) = 300b - ab - b\u00b2\n\nThird term: a*c = a*(300 - a - b) = 300a - a\u00b2 - ab\n\nAdding all three together:\n\nab + (300b - ab - b\u00b2) + (300a - a\u00b2 - ab)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nab - ab - ab = -ab\n\n300b + 300a = 300(a + b)\n\n- b\u00b2 - a\u00b2\n\nSo overall:\n\nQ = -ab - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 300(a + b)\n\nSimilarly, P = abc = a*b*(300 - a - b)\n\nSo substituting into the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000:\n\n100*(-ab - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 300(a + b)) - [a*b*(300 - a - b)] = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, this is getting quite involved. Let me see if I can rearrange terms or find a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the given equation and the sum a + b + c = 300 can lead to a relationship that variables must be in an arithmetic progression or something. Wait, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of variables as x, y, z with x = a, y = b, z = c, and perhaps use substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the case where one variable is 0. Suppose c = 0, then a + b = 300, and the equation becomes a\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0 + 0 = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab*300 = 6,000,000.\n\nSo ab*300 = 6,000,000 \u21d2 ab = 20,000.\n\nSo if c = 0, then a and b are nonnegative integers with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. Let's see if this is possible.\n\nWe can set up the quadratic equation: Let a and b be roots of x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0.\n\nDiscriminant: 300\u00b2 - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.\n\nSquare root of discriminant is 100. So roots are [300 \u00b1 100]/2 = (400)/2 = 200 or (200)/2 = 100.\n\nTherefore, a and b are 200 and 100. So the triples would be (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). Also, since c can be any of the variables, we need to consider permutations. So if c = 0, then the solutions are permutations of (200, 100, 0). So how many permutations are there?\n\nThere are 3 variables, so the non-zero elements can be arranged in 3 positions for the 0. For each of those, the 200 and 100 can be in the other two positions. So total of 3 * 2 = 6 solutions.\n\nWait, but (200, 100, 0), (200, 0, 100), (100, 200, 0), (100, 0, 200), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200). Yes, that's 6 triples where one variable is 0, and the other two are 200 and 100. So that's 6 solutions.\n\nAdditionally, the case where all variables are equal, which is (100,100,100), so that's another solution. So so far, we have 7 solutions. But are there more?\n\nWait, let me check if there are other cases where one variable is zero but with different a and b. Wait, when c = 0, we found that the only solutions are those with a=200, b=100 or vice versa. So that's the only solution in that case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where two variables are zero? Let's check that. Suppose two variables are zero, say b = c = 0, then a = 300. Then the expression becomes a\u00b2b + ... but all terms would be zero since b and c are zero. So that gives 0 \u2260 6,000,000. So that's invalid. Similarly, any two variables being zero would lead to the expression being zero, which is too small. So two variables can't be zero.\n\nSo only one variable can be zero, leading to 6 solutions as above.\n\nNow, are there solutions where none of the variables are zero? Let me see.\n\nSuppose all a, b, c are positive integers. Let me see if there are such triples.\n\nWe already have the all-100 solution. Let me see if there are others.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Let me recall the equation we had earlier:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me rearrange this as abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can factor this equation or find some relation.\n\nAlternatively, let me divide both sides by abc (assuming none are zero):\n\n1 = 100(1/c + 1/a + 1/b) - 2,000,000/(abc).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables as x = a, y = b, z = c, so x + y + z = 300, and the equation is 100(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2,000,000.\n\nPerhaps, let me denote variables as x, y, z. Let me think of this equation and see if I can find another symmetric solution or another set of values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume two variables are equal but not all three. Suppose a = b \u2260 c. Wait, earlier when I assumed a = b, the only solution was a = b = c. So perhaps there are no solutions where two variables are equal but not all three?\n\nWait, in that case, when I set a = b, the equation forced c to also be equal. So maybe that's the only solution when two variables are equal.\n\nAlternatively, let me try some numerical examples.\n\nSuppose a = 150, b = 150, c = 0. But then c is zero, which we already considered. The expression would be a\u00b2b + ... but let me check:\n\nWait, if a = 150, b = 150, c = 0, then the expression is (150)^2*150 + (150)^2*0 + (150)^2*150 + ... Wait, actually, let me compute it properly.\n\nWait, a = 150, b = 150, c = 0:\n\na\u00b2b = 150\u00b2*150 = 150^3\n\na\u00b2c = 150\u00b2*0 = 0\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a = 150\u00b2*150 = same as a\u00b2b, so 150^3\n\nb\u00b2c = 0\n\nc\u00b2a and c\u00b2b are 0.\n\nThen total expression is 150^3 + 150^3 = 2*(3,375,000) = 6,750,000 which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too big. So that's not a solution.\n\nHmm. Let me try another example. Suppose a = 120, b = 180, c = 0. Then ab = 120*180 = 21,600. So 21,600 * 300 = 6,480,000. Wait, but if c = 0, then the expression is a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab*300. So if a + b = 300, then the total is 300ab. So setting 300ab = 6,000,000 gives ab = 20,000, which was the case when a and b are 200 and 100. So that's the only solution with c=0. So other splits would not work.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider a case where all variables are different and non-zero.\n\nSuppose a=100, b=100, c=100 is already considered. What if a=150, b=100, c=50. Let me compute the expression:\n\na + b + c = 150+100+50=300. Good.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = 150\u00b2*100 = 22500*100 = 2,250,000\n\na\u00b2c = 150\u00b2*50 = 22500*50 = 1,125,000\n\nb\u00b2a = 100\u00b2*150 = 10,000*150 = 1,500,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 100\u00b2*50 = 10,000*50 = 500,000\n\nc\u00b2a = 50\u00b2*150 = 2,500*150 = 375,000\n\nc\u00b2b = 50\u00b2*100 = 2,500*100 = 250,000\n\nAdding all these up:\n\n2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 \u2192 4,875,000\n\n+500,000 \u2192 5,375,000\n\n+375,000 \u2192 5,750,000\n\n+250,000 \u2192 6,000,000.\n\nWait, that adds up to exactly 6,000,000! So (150, 100, 50) is another solution. Interesting. So this is a solution where all three variables are different. Therefore, there are more solutions than just the symmetric one and the ones with a zero.\n\nHmm, so my earlier assumption that setting two variables equal only gives the symmetric solution might not be the only case. Let me see how this works.\n\nWait, so in this case, (150,100,50) is a solution. Let me check the equation for this triple.\n\nFirst, a + b + c = 150 + 100 + 50 = 300, good.\n\nThe expression gives 6,000,000 as above, so that's valid. So that's another solution.\n\nNow, how many permutations of this are there?\n\nThe numbers 150, 100, 50 are all distinct, so the number of permutations is 3! = 6. So that adds 6 more solutions.\n\nWait, so that gives 6 more, so total so far is 6 (from the zero case) + 1 (all 100s) + 6 (from 150,100,50) = 13? Wait, but maybe there are more such triples?\n\nHmm, let me see if there are other triples with distinct numbers.\n\nLet me try another set. Let me see if there's another combination.\n\nSuppose a = 200, b = 50, c = 50. Let me check.\n\nSum: 200+50+50=300. Good.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\na\u00b2b = 200\u00b2*50 = 40,000*50 = 2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b = 2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a = 50\u00b2*200 = 2,500*200 = 500,000\n\nb\u00b2c = same as b\u00b2a = 500,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a = 500,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c = 500,000\n\nWait, let me compute each term step by step:\n\na\u00b2b = (200)^2 *50 = 40000*50 = 2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as above = 2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a = (50)^2 *200 = 2500*200 = 500,000\n\nb\u00b2c = (50)^2 *50 = 2500*50 = 125,000\n\nWait, hold on, c is 50, so b\u00b2c is (50)^2 *50? Wait, b is 50, c is 50. So b\u00b2c = (50)^2 *50 = 125,000. Wait, but c\u00b2a would be (50)^2 *200 = 500,000.\n\nSimilarly, c\u00b2b = (50)^2 *50 = 125,000. Wait, so adding all terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 4,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = 500,000 + 125,000 = 625,000\n\nc\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 500,000 + 125,000 = 625,000\n\nTotal: 4,000,000 + 625,000 + 625,000 = 5,250,000. Which is less than 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.\n\nHmm, okay. Maybe that's not a solution. Let me try another set. Let me think of variables where two are equal but not all three. Wait, earlier when I set a = b, I ended up with all equal, but maybe there's another way?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another triple similar to (150,100,50). Let me suppose a = 200, b = 100, c = 0, but that's already covered in the zero case. Alternatively, maybe (250, 50, 0) but let's see:\n\na + b + c = 250 + 50 + 0 = 300. The expression would be a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + ... but c=0:\n\na\u00b2b = 250\u00b2*50 = 62,500*50 = 3,125,000\n\na\u00b2c = 0\n\nb\u00b2a = 50\u00b2*250 = 2,500*250 = 625,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 0\n\nc\u00b2a and c\u00b2b =0\n\nTotal: 3,125,000 + 625,000 = 3,750,000 < 6,000,000. Not enough.\n\nHmm. Let me think of another approach. Since I found that (150, 100, 50) works, perhaps there are other triples in arithmetic progression? Let's see. The numbers 50,100,150 are in arithmetic progression with common difference 50. Let me see if triples like 100, 100, 100 (which is a special case of that), and 50,100,150 are the only ones?\n\nWait, let me try another arithmetic progression. Let's say with difference 25: 75, 100, 125. Their sum is 300. Let's check the expression:\n\na=75, b=100, c=125.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b = 75\u00b2*100 = 5625*100 = 562,500\n\na\u00b2c = 75\u00b2*125 = 5625*125 = 703,125\n\nb\u00b2a = 100\u00b2*75 = 10,000*75 = 750,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 100\u00b2*125 = 1,250,000\n\nc\u00b2a = 125\u00b2*75 = 15,625*75 = 1,171,875\n\nc\u00b2b = 125\u00b2*100 = 15,625*100 = 1,562,500\n\nAdding all these:\n\n562,500 + 703,125 = 1,265,625\n\n+750,000 = 2,015,625\n\n+1,250,000 = 3,265,625\n\n+1,171,875 = 4,437,500\n\n+1,562,500 = 6,000,000.\n\nWait, that adds up to exactly 6,000,000! So (75, 100, 125) is another solution. So that's another triple in arithmetic progression with difference 25. Interesting. So permutations of this would also be solutions. Since all are distinct, there are 6 permutations. So that adds another 6 solutions.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that there might be multiple arithmetic progression triples. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the first non-symmetric solution (150,100,50): differences are 50 each. The second one (75,100,125): differences of 25 each. Let's see if this can be generalized.\n\nSuppose that the three numbers form an arithmetic progression with common difference d, so let the numbers be (100 - d, 100, 100 + d). Then their sum is (100 - d) + 100 + (100 + d) = 300, which works. Let me see what the expression evaluates to.\n\nLet me denote a = 100 - d, b = 100, c = 100 + d.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, a\u00b2b = (100 - d)^2 * 100\n\na\u00b2c = (100 - d)^2 * (100 + d)\n\nb\u00b2a = 100\u00b2 * (100 - d)\n\nb\u00b2c = 100\u00b2 * (100 + d)\n\nc\u00b2a = (100 + d)^2 * (100 - d)\n\nc\u00b2b = (100 + d)^2 * 100\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (100 - d)^2 * 100\n\nSecond term: (100 - d)^2*(100 + d) = (100 - d)^2*(100 + d)\n\nThird term: 100\u00b2*(100 - d) = 10,000*(100 - d)\n\nFourth term: 100\u00b2*(100 + d) = 10,000*(100 + d)\n\nFifth term: (100 + d)^2*(100 - d)\n\nSixth term: (100 + d)^2*100\n\nHmm, this seems complex, but maybe we can combine terms.\n\nLet me group terms:\n\nTerms 1 and 6: a\u00b2b + c\u00b2b = b(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 100[(100 - d)^2 + (100 + d)^2]\n\nTerms 2 and 5: a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a = a c (a + c) = (100 - d)(100 + d)[(100 - d) + (100 + d)] = (100\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(200)\n\nTerms 3 and 4: b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c) = 100\u00b2*(200)\n\nTherefore, total expression is:\n\n100[(100 - d)^2 + (100 + d)^2] + (100\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(200) + 100\u00b2*200\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst part: 100[(100 - d)^2 + (100 + d)^2]\n\nExpand (100 - d)^2 = 10,000 - 200d + d\u00b2\n\n(100 + d)^2 = 10,000 + 200d + d\u00b2\n\nAdding them: 20,000 + 2d\u00b2\n\nMultiply by 100: 100*(20,000 + 2d\u00b2) = 2,000,000 + 200d\u00b2\n\nSecond part: (100\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(200) = (10,000 - d\u00b2)*200 = 2,000,000 - 200d\u00b2\n\nThird part: 100\u00b2*200 = 10,000*200 = 2,000,000\n\nNow add all three parts:\n\nFirst part + second part: (2,000,000 + 200d\u00b2) + (2,000,000 - 200d\u00b2) = 4,000,000\n\nAdd third part: 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nWow! So regardless of the value of d, the expression equals 6,000,000. That's fascinating. Therefore, any arithmetic progression centered at 100 with common difference d will satisfy the equation. So as long as the three numbers are in arithmetic progression with average 100, their sum is 300, and the expression will be 6,000,000. So that means there are infinitely many such triples? Wait, but since a, b, c must be nonnegative integers, d must be such that all terms are nonnegative.\n\nSo the terms are 100 - d, 100, 100 + d. To ensure nonnegativity:\n\n100 - d \u2265 0 \u21d2 d \u2264 100,\n\nand 100 + d can be any as long as d is nonnegative. But since d is a nonnegative integer (since a, b, c are integers), d can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 100.\n\nWait, but when d = 0, all terms are 100, which is the symmetric solution we found earlier.\n\nWhen d = 50, we get (50, 100, 150), which is the first non-symmetric solution.\n\nWhen d =25, we get (75, 100, 125), which was another solution.\n\nSimilarly, d=10 would give (90, 100, 110), which would also satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, all triples where the three numbers form an arithmetic progression centered at 100 are solutions, as long as they are nonnegative integers.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of d are integers from 0 to 100 inclusive. However, when d=0, all three numbers are equal (100,100,100). For d from 1 to 100, each gives a distinct triple where the numbers are in AP. However, we need to ensure that all three numbers are nonnegative integers. Since d can be any integer from 0 up to 100, the number of such triples would be 101 (from d=0 to d=100). But each d from 1 to 100 gives two distinct triples except when d=0? Wait, no. Wait, when d is varied, each d corresponds to a unique triple, but when you consider permutations, actually, for each d \u22600, the triple (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) can be permuted in different ways. Wait, but in the arithmetic progression, the order is fixed as (small, middle, large). However, the problem counts triples (a,b,c) where order matters. So each arithmetic progression with difference d (for d from 0 to 100) gives 6 permutations unless there are duplicates.\n\nWait, actually, for each d \u22600, the three numbers are distinct, so each such triple can be arranged in 6 different orders. However, when d =0, the triple is (100,100,100), which only has one arrangement.\n\nWait, but in our earlier examples, like (150, 100, 50), which corresponds to d=50, when we permute it, we get all permutations of those three numbers, which are 6 different triples. Similarly for d=25, etc. So actually, each d from 1 to 100 corresponds to 6 triples, and d=0 corresponds to 1 triple. But wait, but if d and -d give the same set? Wait, no. Because d is nonnegative. Since we defined d as the common difference such that the terms are 100 - d, 100, 100 + d, so d is nonnegative. So each d from 0 to 100 gives exactly one unordered triple. But since the problem counts ordered triples, each unordered triple (except the all-100 case) corresponds to 6 ordered triples.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples from the arithmetic progression solutions would be:\n\nFor d from 1 to 100: each gives 6 ordered triples,\n\nplus the single triple when d=0.\n\nThus total is 100*6 +1= 601? Wait, but hold on.\n\nWait, but when d=100, the terms would be 0, 100, 200. So that's a valid triple (0,100,200). But this is actually part of the case where one variable is zero. Wait, but earlier when we considered the case with a zero, we found triples like (200,100,0), which is the same as (0,100,200) when permuted. So in the arithmetic progression approach, d=100 gives (0,100,200), which is already included in the case where one variable is zero (which gives 6 permutations). So this suggests that the arithmetic progression approach includes those cases where one variable is zero, but when we considered them earlier, we found that those cases only have solutions where the two non-zero numbers multiply to 20,000. Let me check for d=100: the numbers are 0,100,200. Then their product terms: a=0, b=100, c=200. Then ab + bc + ca = 0*100 + 100*200 + 200*0 = 20,000. Then 100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 100*(20,000) - 0 = 2,000,000, which matches the equation. So yes, that works. So in effect, the arithmetic progression approach includes all the solutions where variables are in AP, including those with a zero. So when we calculated the case with a zero variable, we found exactly those solutions where the non-zero terms form an AP with difference 100 (for example, 100 and 200 differ by 100, but the zero is part of the AP as the first term). Wait, actually, in the case of d=100, the AP is 0, 100, 200, so difference 100. So indeed, all those cases are included here.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples from the arithmetic progression approach is (101 values of d: 0 to 100) each contributing ordered triples. Wait, but actually for each d from 1 to 100, the unordered triple can be arranged in 6 ways, so 6 triples per d. For d=0, it's only 1 triple. So total triples from AP would be 100*6 +1 = 601. But wait, but earlier when we considered the zero case, we had 6 solutions. The arithmetic progression for d=100 gives exactly those 6 permutations of (0,100,200). Similarly, d=50 gives permutations of (50,100,150), which are 6 solutions. Similarly for d=25, permutations of (75,100,125). So all these are covered in the arithmetic progression approach. Therefore, the total number of triples from the arithmetic progression is indeed 601? Wait, but hold on. Let me check for d=50: the numbers are 50,100,150. That's one unordered triple, which can be permuted in 6 ways, so 6 ordered triples. Similarly for each d from 1 to 100, so 100*6, plus the one where d=0. So total 601.\n\nHowever, wait, when d=0, it's (100,100,100), which is one triple.\n\nBut is there any overlap? For example, when d=50, the triple (50,100,150) is distinct from triples from other d's. So no overlaps except for the zero case, which is already counted in d=100. So total is indeed 601.\n\nBut wait, but in the problem statement, we need nonnegative integers. So when d is from 0 to 100, inclusive, then yes, all terms are nonnegative. So that would give 101 values of d, each giving a distinct unordered triple, and when considering ordered triples, except for the case d=0, each gives 6 ordered triples. So total is 101 + (100 *5) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, sorry, if each d from 1 to 100 gives 6 ordered triples, and d=0 gives 1, then total is 1 + 100*6 = 601. That seems right.\n\nBut earlier, I found another solution: (150,100,50) which is part of d=50, so that's accounted for here. Similarly, the (75,100,125) is part of d=25, so that's included.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check if there are any other solutions outside of these arithmetic progressions. Suppose I take a triple that is not in an arithmetic progression. Let me see if that can satisfy the equation.\n\nSuppose a=120, b= 120, c=60. Sum is 300. Let me compute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nFirst, a\u00b2b = 120\u00b2*120 = 120^3 = 1,728,000\n\na\u00b2c = 120\u00b2*60 = 14,400*60 = 864,000\n\nb\u00b2a = same as a\u00b2b =1,728,000\n\nb\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2c =864,000\n\nc\u00b2a = 60\u00b2*120 = 3,600*120 = 432,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as c\u00b2a =432,000\n\nTotal:\n\n1,728,000 + 864,000 = 2,592,000\n\n+1,728,000 = 4,320,000\n\n+864,000 = 5,184,000\n\n+432,000 = 5,616,000\n\n+432,000 = 6,048,000. Not 6,000,000. Close but not quite.\n\nHmm, so that's not a solution. Let me try another one. Suppose a= 140, b=100, c=60. Sum is 300.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b =140\u00b2*100 =19,600*100=1,960,000\n\na\u00b2c =140\u00b2*60 =19,600*60=1,176,000\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*140=1,000,000*140=140,000,000? Wait, no. Wait, 100\u00b2 is 10,000, so 10,000*140 = 1,400,000.\n\nb\u00b2c =100\u00b2*60 =10,000*60=600,000\n\nc\u00b2a=60\u00b2*140=3,600*140=504,000\n\nc\u00b2b=60\u00b2*100=3,600*100=360,000\n\nAdding up:\n\n1,960,000 +1,176,000 =3,136,000\n\n+1,400,000 =4,536,000\n\n+600,000 =5,136,000\n\n+504,000 =5,640,000\n\n+360,000 =6,000,000.\n\nWait, that works! So (140,100,60) is another solution. But is this an arithmetic progression?\n\nCheck if they form an arithmetic progression. Let's see:\n\nThe numbers are 60,100,140. The differences are 40 and 40. So yes! 60,100,140 is an arithmetic progression with common difference 40. So d=40 here. So that is included in the arithmetic progression solutions. So that's covered.\n\nTherefore, every time I try a triple that works, it turns out to be part of an arithmetic progression centered at 100. So perhaps all solutions are exactly the arithmetic progression triples. Therefore, the total number of triples is 601?\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another example. Suppose d= 30. Then the triple is 70,100,130. Let's check if that works.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na=70, b=100, c=130.\n\na\u00b2b =70\u00b2*100 =4,900*100=490,000\n\na\u00b2c =70\u00b2*130 =4,900*130=637,000\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*70=10,000*70=700,000\n\nb\u00b2c=100\u00b2*130=10,000*130=1,300,000\n\nc\u00b2a=130\u00b2*70=16,900*70=1,183,000\n\nc\u00b2b=130\u00b2*100=16,900*100=1,690,000\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n490,000 + 637,000 = 1,127,000\n\n+700,000 =1,827,000\n\n+1,300,000 =3,127,000\n\n+1,183,000 =4,310,000\n\n+1,690,000 =6,000,000. Perfect, it works. So indeed, all arithmetic progression triples work.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all solutions are the triples where a, b, c form an arithmetic progression centered at 100 (i.e., their average is 100), and the number of such triples is calculated as follows:\n\nEach arithmetic progression is determined by the common difference d, which can be from 0 to 100. For each d from 1 to 100, there are 6 permutations of the triple (100 - d, 100, 100 + d). For d=0, there's only one triple (100, 100, 100).\n\nTherefore, total number of triples is 1 + 100*6 = 601.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me check if all these triples are distinct. For example, when d=50, the triple is (50,100,150). When d=100, it's (0,100,200). These are all distinct triples. However, when d and another d' produce the same set of numbers? For instance, is there a case where different d's lead to the same triple?\n\nSuppose d1 and d2 such that 100 - d1 = 100 + d2, but that would require -d1 = d2, but since d is non-negative, this can't happen unless d1=d2=0. So no overlaps. Therefore, each d from 0 to 100 gives a unique unordered triple. So the count is correct.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"nonnegative integers\", so when d=100, the first term is 0, which is allowed. So yes, all d from 0 to 100 are valid.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 1 + 6*100 = 601. However, wait, let me confirm with the earlier examples. When d=50, that gives 6 triples, like (50,100,150), (50,150,100), etc., each permutation. Similarly for d=25, etc. So yes, 6 per d from 1 to 100, plus 1 for d=0. So total 601.\n\nWait, but in the earlier case where we considered triples with a zero (i.e., d=100), that gives 6 triples, which are included in the 601. Similarly, the all-100 case is included. So that seems to cover everything.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so zero is allowed. So yes, all those are valid.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other solutions outside of the arithmetic progression triples. Suppose I take a triple that is not in an arithmetic progression. Let me try (100, 100, 100): that's arithmetic progression with d=0. So it's included. How about (120, 100, 80). That is an arithmetic progression with d=20. So included. Let me try a triple that's not in AP: say (110, 100, 90). That is an arithmetic progression with d=10. So also included. Wait, actually any three numbers with average 100 must form an arithmetic progression? Wait, no. Wait, if three numbers have an average of 100, their sum is 300. If they form an arithmetic progression, then they must be equally spaced around 100. But if they are not equally spaced, but still sum to 300, they might not form an AP. Let me see.\n\nLet me try an example: (90, 100, 110). That's an AP with d=10. Now, what about (80, 110, 110)? Their sum is 300. Are they in an AP? Let's see: 80, 110, 110. The differences are 30 and 0, so not an AP. Let me check if this is a solution.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na=80, b=110, c=110.\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nFirst terms:\n\na\u00b2b = 80\u00b2*110 = 6,400*110 = 704,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b =704,000\n\nb\u00b2a =110\u00b2*80 = 12,100*80 = 968,000\n\nb\u00b2c =110\u00b2*110 = 12,100*110 = 1,331,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a =968,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c =1,331,000\n\nNow adding all terms:\n\n704,000 +704,000 =1,408,000\n\n+968,000 =2,376,000\n\n+1,331,000 =3,707,000\n\n+968,000 =4,675,000\n\n+1,331,000 =6,006,000. Hmm, which is 6,006,000, not 6,000,000. Close but not equal. So that's not a solution.\n\nTherefore, this triple doesn't work, which is good because it's not an arithmetic progression. So only the arithmetic progression triples work.\n\nTherefore, I think it's safe to say that all solutions are exactly the arithmetic progression triples. Thus the total number is 601.\n\nWait, but let me check another non-AP triple. Let's say (100, 150, 50) which is AP, but suppose I take (99, 101, 100). Wait, that is an AP with d=1. So that's included.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I have a triple like (120, 90, 90). Their sum is 300. Are they in AP? 90,90,120. The differences are 0 and 30, so no. Let's compute the expression:\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\na\u00b2b =120\u00b2*90 =14,400*90=1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b =1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a =90\u00b2*120 =8,100*120=972,000\n\nb\u00b2c =90\u00b2*90 =8,100*90=729,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a =972,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c =729,000\n\nTotal:\n\n1,296,000 +1,296,000 =2,592,000\n\n+972,000 =3,564,000\n\n+729,000 =4,293,000\n\n+972,000 =5,265,000\n\n+729,000 =6,000,000.\n\nWait, that adds up to exactly 6,000,000! But this triple is (120,90,90). Are these in an arithmetic progression?\n\nLet me see: 90,90,120. The differences are 0 and 30. Not an arithmetic progression. Wait, but according to the calculation, this triple also works. But according to our previous logic, it shouldn't.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. This contradicts our previous conclusion. Let me verify the calculation again:\n\nWait, let's recalculate for (120,90,90):\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = (120)^2*90 = 14,400 *90 = 1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b =1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a = (90)^2*120 = 8,100 *120 = 972,000\n\nb\u00b2c = (90)^2*90 = 8,100*90 = 729,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a =972,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c =729,000\n\nNow add them:\n\n1,296,000 + 1,296,000 = 2,592,000\n\n+972,000 = 3,564,000\n\n+729,000 = 4,293,000\n\n+972,000 = 5,265,000\n\n+729,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nYes, it does add up. So this triple (120,90,90) is a solution but is not an arithmetic progression. So my previous conclusion was wrong. There are solutions outside of arithmetic progressions.\n\nHmm, so my mistake was assuming all solutions are arithmetic progressions, but apparently there are others.\n\nSo I need to rethink this.\n\nLet me see why this triple works. Let me check the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nFor the triple (120,90,90):\n\nCompute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab = 120*90 = 10,800\n\nbc = 90*90 = 8,100\n\nca = 90*120 = 10,800\n\nTotal Q = 10,800 + 8,100 + 10,800 = 29,700\n\nabc = 120*90*90 = 120*8,100 = 972,000\n\nThen 100*29,700 - 972,000 = 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000. Wait, but that's not equal to 2,000,000. Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, hold on, the problem states that the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. But according to the previous calculation, that triple gives exactly 6,000,000, but according to this equation, it's not satisfying 100Q - abc = 2,000,000. There must be an error in my calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate Q and abc for (120,90,90):\n\nQ = ab + bc + ca = (120\u00d790)+(90\u00d790)+(90\u00d7120) = 10,800 + 8,100 + 10,800 = 29,700.\n\nabc = 120\u00d790\u00d790 = 120\u00d78,100 = 972,000.\n\nThen 100\u00d729,700 = 2,970,000.\n\n2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000, which is not equal to 2,000,000. So there is a discrepancy here. But when I computed the original expression, I got 6,000,000. Let me recalculate the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nBreaking down:\n\na\u00b2b = 120\u00b2\u00d790 = 14,400\u00d790 = 1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = 120\u00b2\u00d790 = same as above = 1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a = 90\u00b2\u00d7120 = 8,100\u00d7120 = 972,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 90\u00b2\u00d790 = 8,100\u00d790 = 729,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a = 972,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c = 729,000\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1,296,000 + 1,296,000 = 2,592,000\n\n+972,000 = 3,564,000\n\n+729,000 = 4,293,000\n\n+972,000 = 5,265,000\n\n+729,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's correct. But according to the equation 100Q - abc = 2,000,000, it should be 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000 \u2260 2,000,000. There's a contradiction here. Which means I must have made a mistake in my derivation earlier.\n\nWait, let's go back to the original equations. Let me rederive the relationship between the given expression and the equation I had.\n\nOriginal problem's expression:\n\nE = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nWe had earlier derived that:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = E + 3abc.\n\nTherefore, E = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 300,\n\nE = 300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nTherefore, the equation given in the problem is:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\n100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for the triple (120, 90, 90):\n\nLeft-hand side: 100*29,700 - 972,000 = 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000 \u2260 2,000,000. Which contradicts the original equation. But when we computed E directly, we got 6,000,000. That must mean that there's an error in the direct computation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate E for (120,90,90):\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = (120)^2 *90 = 14,400 *90 = 1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b =1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a = (90)^2 *120 = 8,100 *120 = 972,000\n\nb\u00b2c = (90)^2 *90 = 8,100 *90 = 729,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a =972,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c =729,000\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1,296,000 +1,296,000 = 2,592,000\n\n+972,000 = 3,564,000\n\n+729,000 = 4,293,000\n\n+972,000 = 5,265,000\n\n+729,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's correct, but according to the equation, it should not satisfy. Therefore, there's a mistake in my derivation?\n\nWait, let me recompute E using the formula:\n\nE = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo with a=120, b=90, c=90:\n\nab + bc + ca = (120\u00d790)+(90\u00d790)+(90\u00d7120) = 10,800 + 8,100 + 10,800 = 29,700.\n\n(a + b + c) = 300.\n\nSo 300\u00d729,700 = 8,910,000\n\n3abc = 3\u00d7120\u00d790\u00d790 = 3\u00d7972,000 = 2,916,000.\n\nTherefore, E = 8,910,000 - 2,916,000 = 5,994,000.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the direct calculation of 6,000,000. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Which is correct?\n\nLet me compute E directly again:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = 120\u00b2\u00d790 + 120\u00b2\u00d790 = 2\u00d7(14400\u00d790) = 2\u00d71,296,000 = 2,592,000\n\nb\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = 90\u00b2\u00d7120 + 90\u00b2\u00d790 = (8100\u00d7120)+(8100\u00d790) = 972,000 + 729,000 = 1,701,000\n\nc\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 90\u00b2\u00d7120 + 90\u00b2\u00d790 = same as above, so another 1,701,000.\n\nWait, but hold on, c\u00b2a is 90\u00b2\u00d7120 = same as b\u00b2a, yes. Similarly c\u00b2b is 90\u00b2\u00d790 same as b\u00b2c. Therefore total:\n\n2,592,000 (a\u00b2 terms) + 1,701,000 (b\u00b2 terms) + 1,701,000 (c\u00b2 terms) ?\n\nWait, no, no, no. Wait, the terms are:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nBreaking down:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c) = 120\u00b2*(90 + 90) = 14,400*180 = 2,592,000\n\nb\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c) = 90\u00b2*(120 + 90) = 8,100*210 = 1,701,000\n\nc\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = c\u00b2(a + b) = 90\u00b2*(120 + 90) = same as above = 1,701,000\n\nTotal E = 2,592,000 + 1,701,000 + 1,701,000 = 2,592,000 + 3,402,000 = 6,  (2,592 + 3,402) = 6,000? Wait, 2,592,000 + 3,402,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nBut according to the formula, E should be 5,994,000. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recompute via the formula:\n\nE = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\n= 300\u00d729,700 - 3\u00d7(120\u00d790\u00d790)\n\n= 300\u00d729,700 = 8,910,000\n\n3\u00d7120\u00d790\u00d790 = 3\u00d7120\u00d78,100 = 3\u00d7972,000 = 2,916,000\n\nSo 8,910,000 - 2,916,000 = 5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation gives 6,000,000. There is a discrepancy of 6,000. So there must be an error in one of the calculations.\n\nWait, let me check the direct computation again:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c: 120\u00b2\u00d790 + 120\u00b2\u00d790 = 2\u00d714,400\u00d790 = 2\u00d71,296,000 = 2,592,000.\n\nb\u00b2a + b\u00b2c: 90\u00b2\u00d7120 + 90\u00b2\u00d790 = 8,100\u00d7120 + 8,100\u00d790.\n\n8,100\u00d7120 = 972,000.\n\n8,100\u00d790 = 729,000.\n\nTotal for b terms: 972k + 729k = 1,701,000.\n\nc\u00b2a + c\u00b2b: same as b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c because c is 90, same as b.

Therefore, the formula must have been applied incorrectly.\n\nWait, the formula says E = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nWait, let me recalculate (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\na + b + c = 300\n\nab + bc + ca = 29,700\n\nThus, 300\u00d729,700 = 300\u00d729,700.\n\nWait 300\u00d729,700 = 300\u00d729,700 = let's compute 29,700\u00d7300:\n\n29,700 \u00d7 300 = 29,700 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 100 = 89,100 \u00d7 100 = 8,910,000.

Correct.\n\na\u00b2c = same, so total a\u00b2 terms: 2,592,000.\n\nb\u00b2a:90\u00b2\u00d7120:\n\n8100 \u00d7120: 8100\u00d7100=810,000; 8100\u00d720=162,000; total 972,000. Correct.\n\nb\u00b2c:8100\u00d790=729,000.\n\nc\u00b2a: same as b\u00b2a, so 972,000.\n\nc\u00b2b: same as b\u00b2c, so 729,000.\n\nAdding up:\n\n2,592,000 + 972,000 = 3,564,000.\n\nAdd 729,000 \u21924,293,000.\n\nAdd 972,000 \u21925,265,000.\n\nAdd 729,000 \u21926,000,000.\n\nHmm. So there must be a mistake in the formula derivation. Wait, let's re-derive it again.\n\nCompute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n= a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)\n\n= a\u00b2b + a b c + a\u00b2c + a b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + b c a + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a.\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n= (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c) + (b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c) + (c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 3abc.\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed E + 3abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca).\n\nHence E = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo the formula is correct, so why discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the given problem's expression is different?\n\nWait the problem's expression is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b, which is exactly E. So according to the problem's equation, that must equal 6,000,000.\n\nBut according to the formula, E = (300)(29,700) - 3\u00d7972,000 = 8,910,000 - 2,916,000 =5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation says 6,000,000. So there must be an error in the arithmetic in one of these.\n\nWait, perhaps my direct computation is wrong. Let me compute E again step by step:\n\nCompute all terms:\n\n1. a\u00b2b = 120\u00b2 * 90 = 14,400 * 90 = 1,296,000\n\n2. a\u00b2c = 120\u00b2 * 90 = 1,296,000\n\n3. b\u00b2a = 90\u00b2 * 120 = 8,100 * 120 = 972,000\n\n4. b\u00b2c = 90\u00b2 * 90 = 8,100 * 90 = 729,000\n\n5. c\u00b2a = 90\u00b2 * 120 = same as b\u00b2a = 972,000\n\n6. c\u00b2b = 90\u00b2 * 90 = same as b\u00b2c = 729,000\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1+2: 2,592,000\n\n+3: 2,592,000 + 972,000 = 3,564,000\n\n+4: 3,564,000 + 729,000 = 4,293,000\n\n+5: 4,293,000 + 972,000 = 5,265,000\n\n+6: 5,265,000 + 729,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, so this is correct. Then the formula must be wrong? But that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I have misapplied the formula. Let me check with another example where I know it works.\n\nTake the triple (100,100,100):\n\nE = 6*(100^3) =6,000,000.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) -3abc = 300*(3*10000) -3*(1,000,000)= 300*30,000 -3,000,000 =9,000,000 -3,000,000 =6,000,000. Correct.\n\nAnother example, the triple (150,100,50):\n\nCompute using formula:\n\nab + bc + ca =150\u00d7100 +100\u00d750 +50\u00d7150 =15,000 +5,000 +7,500=27,500.\n\n3abc=3\u00d7150\u00d7100\u00d750=3\u00d7750,000=2,250,000.\n\nThen (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) -3abc =300\u00d727,500 -2,250,000=8,250,000 -2,250,000=6,000,000. Correct.\n\nNow, for the triple (120,90,90):\n\nAccording to formula, E should be5,994,000 but direct computation is6,000,000. There's a 6,000 difference. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\nWait, 300 \u00d729,700:\n\n29,700 \u00d7 300:\n\n29,700 \u00d7 100 =2,970,000,\n\n\u00d73 \u2192 8,910,000. Correct.\n\nThen subtract 3abc=2,916,000 gives 5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation gives6,000,000. The difference is6,000,000 -5,994,000=6,000.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in computing ab + bc + ca?\n\nWait, ab =120\u00d790=10,800,\n\nbc=90\u00d790=8,100,\n\nca=90\u00d7120=10,800,\n\nTotal:10,800+8,100+10,800=29,700. Correct.\n\nHmm. This is perplexing. Unless there is a miscalculation in the direct computation that I can't see. Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem's expression? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triple (120,90,90) is not a solution. But according to direct computation, it is.\n\nWait, let me check with another method. Let me compute E using the formula and see:\n\nE = 300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nWhich would be 300\u00d729,700 -3\u00d7972,000 =8,910,000 -2,916,000 =5,994,000.\n\nBut the problem says that E must be6,000,000. So this triple does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, my direct computation must be wrong. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the terms:\n\nWait, the expression is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me recompute each term carefully:\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\na\u00b2b: 120 squared is14,400. 14,400 \u00d790=1,296,000.\n\na\u00b2c: same as above:1,296,000.\n\nb\u00b2a:90 squared is8,100. 8,100\u00d7120=972,000.\n\nb\u00b2c:8,100\u00d790=729,000.\n\nc\u00b2a:90 squared \u00d7120=8,100\u00d7120=972,000.\n\nc\u00b2b:90 squared \u00d790=8,100\u00d790=729,000.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n1,296,000 +1,296,000=2,592,000.\n\n+972,000=3,564,000.\n\n+729,000=4,293,000.\n\n+972,000=5,265,000.\n\n+729,000=6,000,000.\n\nWait, the calculation is correct. So the formula must be wrong?\n\nBut for the triple (100,100,100):\n\nFormula gives correct result. For (150,100,50) also correct. For (120,90,90) discrepancy. What's different here?\n\nWait, in the case of (120,90,90), perhaps one of the terms is miscalculated?\n\nWait, c\u00b2a is c squared times a: c is 90, so 90\u00b2\u00d7120 = 8,100\u00d7120=972,000. Correct.\n\nSimilarly c\u00b2b is 90\u00b2\u00d790=729,000.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have misunderstood the problem's expression. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"The number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c) satisfying a + b + c = 300 and a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000.\"\n\nYes, that's exactly what I used. So the problem is that according to the formula, this triple should not satisfy the equation, but according to direct computation, it does. This contradiction suggests there's an error in the formula derivation.\n\nWait, let me recompute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = E + 3abc.\n\nSo if E =6,000,000, then (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) =6,000,000 +3abc.\n\nIn the case of (120,90,90):\n\n6,000,000 +3\u00d7972,000 =6,000,000+2,916,000=8,916,000.\n\nBut (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=300\u00d729,700=8,910,000.\n\nSo 8,910,000 vs. 8,916,000. The difference is6,000. So the formula is off by exactly the discrepancy in E.\n\nThis suggests that either the formula is incorrect, or there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the expansion carefully:\n\nLet me expand (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\na*(ab) = a\u00b2b,\n\na*(bc) = abc,\n\na*(ca) = a\u00b2c,\n\nb*(ab) = ab\u00b2,\n\nb*(bc) = b\u00b2c,\n\nb*(ca) = abc,\n\nc*(ab) = abc,\n\nc*(bc) = b c\u00b2,\n\nc*(ca) = c\u00b2a.\n\nSo total terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + b c\u00b2 + 3abc.\n\nWait, I think I missed a term in my previous expansion.\n\nWait, c*(bc) is b c\u00b2, and c*(ca)=c\u00b2a. So the terms are:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + b c\u00b2 + 3abc.\n\nWait, but in the original problem's expression, the terms are a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nSo notice that the term bc\u00b2 is written as c\u00b2b, which is the same as b c\u00b2. Similarly, b\u00b2a is the same as ab\u00b2.\n\nThus, the expanded form is indeed E + 3abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca).\n\nTherefore, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that there is an arithmetic mistake in the direct computation. Let me try a different approach for (120,90,90):\n\nCompute E = a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nGroup terms by variables:\n\nFor a:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) = a\u00b2*(90 + 90) =120\u00b2\u00d7180 =14,400\u00d7180 =2,592,000.\n\nFor b:\n\nb\u00b2(a + c) =90\u00b2\u00d7(120 +90)=8,100\u00d7210=1,701,000.\n\nFor c:\n\nc\u00b2(a + b)=90\u00b2\u00d7(120 +90)= same as b's term =1,701,000.\n\nTotal E =2,592,000+1,701,000+1,701,000=6,000,000.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the formula must be wrong?\n\nWait, but for this case:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=300\u00d729,700=8,910,000.\n\nE +3abc=6,000,000+3\u00d7972,000=6,000,000+2,916,000=8,916,000.\n\nThus 8,910,000 vs 8,916,000. The difference is 6,000.\n\nWait, so the formula is missing 6,000?\n\nThere must be an error in the expansion. Wait, let me re-express:\n\nWait, in the expansion:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + 3abc.\n\nWait, but in the problem's expression E, we have a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nNotice that:\n\nab\u00b2 is the same as b\u00b2a,\n\nbc\u00b2 is the same as c\u00b2b,\n\nand ac\u00b2 is the same as c\u00b2a.\n\nSo the terms in the expansion are exactly the terms in E plus 3abc. Therefore, the formula holds.\n\nThus, the discrepancy must be due to an arithmetic error in the example.\n\nWait, let me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) for (120,90,90):\n\nab + bc + ca =29,700.\n\n300\u00d729,700:\n\n29,700 \u00d7 300:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n29,700 \u00d7 300 =29,700 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 100.\n\n29,700 \u00d73:\n\n29,700 \u00d72 =59,400,\n\n29,700 \u00d71=29,700,\n\nTotal:59,400 +29,700=89,100.\n\nThus, 89,100 \u00d7100=8,910,000.\n\nCorrect.\n\nE +3abc=6,000,000+2,916,000=8,916,000.\n\nBut 8,910,000 vs 8,916,000. The difference is exactly 6,000. So where does this come from?\n\nWait, unless there's a mistake in the problem's expression? Or perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the triple (120,90,90). Let me check if it's a valid solution.\n\nWait, according to the problem's equation, E must be 6,000,000. According to direct computation, it is. According to the formula, it's not. This is a paradox.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have miscalculated abc:\n\nabc =120\u00d790\u00d790.\n\n120\u00d790=10,800,\n\n10,800\u00d790=972,000. Correct.\n\n3abc=2,916,000.\n\nSo, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) =8,910,000,\n\nE +3abc=8,910,000 \u21d2 E=8,910,000-3abc=8,910,000 -2,916,000=5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation says E=6,000,000. This is a contradiction.\n\nThe only way this can be resolved is if the formula is incorrect, but that's impossible as it's derived from expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's expression is different? Let me check again:\n\nThe problem says:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nYes, which is exactly E. So I think there must be an error in the problem's arithmetic, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the expansion. Let me try expanding with a=120, b=90, c=90:\n\nCompute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) =300\u00d729,700=8,910,000.\n\nE = a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =6,000,000.\n\nThen 3abc=3\u00d7120\u00d790\u00d790=2,916,000.\n\nThus, E +3abc=6,000,000+2,916,000=8,916,000.\n\nBut (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=8,910,000.\n\nThis is a discrepancy of 6,000. Thus, the formula must be wrong, but I can't see how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the triple (120,90,90). Let me check with another method:\n\nLet me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n=300*(29,700)=8,910,000.\n\nE =6,000,000.\n\nThus, 3abc=E + (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - E = ?\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, the formula says (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = E + 3abc,\n\nSo 3abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - E.\n\nThus, in this case, 3abc =8,910,000 -6,000,000=2,910,000.\n\nBut 3abc=2,916,000.\n\nThus, discrepancy of6,000.\n\nThis suggests that either the formula is incorrect, or the direct computation is wrong.\n\nBut the formula is derived from expanding the product, so it must be correct. Therefore, the direct computation must have an error.\n\nWait, maybe I have miscalculated E's terms:\n\nLet me compute each term again:\n\na\u00b2b =120\u00b2\u00d790=14,400\u00d790=1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b=1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a=90\u00b2\u00d7120=8,100\u00d7120=972,000\n\nb\u00b2c=90\u00b2\u00d790=729,000\n\nc\u00b2a=90\u00b2\u00d7120=972,000\n\nc\u00b2b=90\u00b2\u00d790=729,000\n\nAdding them:\n\n1,296,000 +1,296,000 =2,592,000\n\n+972,000 =3,564,000\n\n+729,000 =4,293,000\n\n+972,000 =5,265,000\n\n+729,000 =6,000,000.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula must be wrong, which is impossible. This is very confusing. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's parameters? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triple (120,90,90) is not a solution, but the direct computation is correct. Which would mean the problem has no solution with that triple. But that contradicts the problem's equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have a miscalculation in the formula:\n\nWait, let me try another triple that's not in AP but might work. Let me try (130, 100, 70). Which is an AP with d=30. Let's see.\n\nCompute using formula:\n\nab + bc + ca =130\u00d7100 +100\u00d770 +70\u00d7130 =13,000 +7,000 +9,100 =29,100.\n\n3abc =3\u00d7130\u00d7100\u00d770 =3\u00d7910,000=2,730,000.\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=300\u00d729,100=8,730,000.\n\nThus, E=8,730,000-2,730,000=6,000,000. Correct. So this works.\n\nNow, let me compute E directly:\n\na=130, b=100, c=70.\n\na\u00b2b =130\u00b2\u00d7100=16,900\u00d7100=1,690,000\n\na\u00b2c =130\u00b2\u00d770=16,900\u00d770=1,183,000\n\nb\u00b2a =100\u00b2\u00d7130=10,000\u00d7130=1,300,000\n\nb\u00b2c =100\u00b2\u00d770=10,000\u00d770=700,000\n\nc\u00b2a =70\u00b2\u00d7130=4,900\u00d7130=637,000\n\nc\u00b2b =70\u00b2\u00d7100=4,900\u00d7100=490,000\n\nTotal:\n\n1,690,000 +1,183,000=2,873,000\n\n+1,300,000=4,173,000\n\n+700,000=4,873,000\n\n+637,000=5,510,000\n\n+490,000=6,000,000. Correct.\n\nThus, formula holds here.\n\nNow, going back to the triple (120,90,90), why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, let me compute 3abc:\n\n3\u00d7120\u00d790\u00d790=3\u00d7120\u00d78100=3\u00d7972,000=2,916,000.\n\nThen, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=300\u00d729,700=8,910,000.\n\nThus, E=8,910,000-2,916,000=5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation gives6,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the only possible conclusion is that there's an error in direct computation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the terms:\n\nLet me re-add:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c =1,296,000 +1,296,000=2,592,000.\n\nb\u00b2a + b\u00b2c =972,000+729,000=1,701,000.\n\nc\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =972,000+729,000=1,701,000.\n\nTotal:\n\n2,592,000 +1,701,000 =4,293,000.\n\n4,293,000 +1,701,000 =5,994,000.\n\nAh! There's the mistake! I think I added incorrectly earlier.\n\nWait, 2,592,000 +1,701,000 is 4,293,000.\n\nThen adding the last 1,701,000 gives 4,293,000 +1,701,000 =6,000,000? Wait, no. 4,293,000 +1,701,000 is 6,000,000.\n\nWait, but 4,293,000 +1,701,000:\n\n4,293,000 +1,701,000:\n\n4,293,000 +1,700,000 =5,993,000,\n\nplus 1,000 gives 5,994,000.\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. I must have added incorrectly before.\n\nYes, so the correct total is5,994,000.\n\nTherefore, my earlier direct computation was wrong. I must have added incorrectly when I thought I got6,000,000. The correct total is5,994,000, which matches the formula.\n\nTherefore, the triple (120,90,90) does not satisfy the equation. So my initial mistake was in adding the terms incorrectly during the direct computation. Phew!\n\nTherefore, all solutions are indeed the arithmetic progression triples. Thus, the total number of triples is 1 (for d=0) + 6*100 =601.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another non-AP triple that it doesn't work.\n\nTake (90, 100, 110), which is an AP with d=10.\n\nCompute using formula:\n\nab + bc + ca=90\u00d7100 +100\u00d7110 +110\u00d790 =9,000+11,000+9,900=29,900.\n\n3abc=3\u00d790\u00d7100\u00d7110=3\u00d7990,000=2,970,000.\n\n(a + b +c)(ab + bc + ca)=300\u00d729,900=8,970,000.\n\nThus, E=8,970,000-2,970,000=6,000,000. Correct.\n\nAnother non-AP triple: (100, 100, 100). Works.\n\nSo all solutions are indeed the arithmetic progression triples.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ordered triples is:\n\nFor d from 0 to 100:\n\n- d=0: (100,100,100) \u2192 1 triple.\n\n- d from 1 to 100: each d gives an unordered triple {100-d, 100, 100+d}, which can be permuted in 6 ways since all elements are distinct (unless d=0, but we already considered d=0). Wait, when d=50, the triple is (50,100,150), which has all distinct elements. Similarly for other d's except when d=0.\n\nThus, each d from 1 to 100 gives 6 ordered triples.\n\nThus total triples: 1 + 100\u00d76 = 601.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that when d=100, the triple is (0,100,200), which includes a zero, and permutations are allowed, which we have already considered.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when d=100, the triple is (0,100,200). The permutations are 6, but one of them is (0,100,200), which is allowed. So all are valid.\n\nTherefore, total number of triples is indeed 601.\n\nBut earlier when I considered the case where one variable is zero, I found 6 solutions (permutations of (200,100,0)), which is included in d=100's count (6 triples). The all-100 case is also counted. So total is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601. So I should put \\boxed{601}.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the earlier example of (150, 100, 50):\n\nThis is part of d=50, so 6 permutations. Similarly for others.\n\nYes, so I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem better.\n\nFirst, the equation a + b + c = 300 is straightforward\u2014it's a classic stars and bars problem if there were no other constraints. But here, there's another equation involving the sum of terms like a\u00b2b. That seems more complicated. Let me see if I can manipulate the given equation to find a relationship between a, b, and c.\n\nLooking at the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b, I notice that each term is of the form one variable squared multiplied by another variable. Maybe I can factor this somehow or relate it to other symmetric expressions. Let me think about symmetric sums.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of (a + b + c) and other symmetric terms. Let me recall that for three variables, there are standard symmetric sums like ab + bc + ca, and abc. Maybe I can relate the given expression to these.\n\nLet me try expanding (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca). Let's compute that:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\nSimplifying each term:\n\n= a\u00b2b + abc + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + abc + abc + bc\u00b2 + c\u00b2a\n\nWait, let's count all terms:\n\nFirst term: a(ab) = a\u00b2b\n\nSecond term: a(bc) = abc\n\nThird term: a(ca) = a\u00b2c\n\nFourth term: b(ab) = ab\u00b2\n\nFifth term: b(bc) = b\u00b2c\n\nSixth term: b(ca) = abc\n\nSeventh term: c(ab) = abc\n\nEighth term: c(bc) = bc\u00b2\n\nNinth term: c(ca) = c\u00b2a\n\nSo when we add all these together:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + bc\u00b2 + c\u00b2a + 3abc.\n\nTherefore, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 3abc.\n\nOh! The given expression in the problem is exactly the first part of this expansion. So, the given equation can be rewritten as:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nBut we know that a + b + c = 300, so substituting that in:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's a helpful equation. Let me write that down:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nMaybe I can divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSo now, the equation becomes:\n\nabc - 100(ab + bc + ca) = -2,000,000.\n\nHmm, not sure if that's helpful yet. Let me see if I can manipulate this further. Alternatively, maybe I can express abc in terms of ab + bc + ca?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of variables in terms of each other. Since a + b + c = 300, maybe set variables as two variables and express the third in terms of them. For instance, let me let c = 300 - a - b. Then substitute into the equation.\n\nBut that might get messy with three variables. Let me see if there's a smarter approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider symmetry. Suppose that two variables are equal. Since the equation is symmetric in a, b, c, maybe the solutions have some symmetry. Let me test that.\n\nSuppose that two variables are equal. Let's say a = b. Then c = 300 - 2a.\n\nSubstitute into the equation:\n\nOriginal equation: a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000.\n\nSince a = b, this becomes:\n\na\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + a\u00b2a + a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2a = 6,000,000\n\nSimplify:\n\n2a\u00b3 + 2a\u00b2c + 2a c\u00b2 = 6,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\na\u00b3 + a\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 = 3,000,000.\n\nBut since c = 300 - 2a, substitute that in:\n\na\u00b3 + a\u00b2(300 - 2a) + a(300 - 2a)^2 = 3,000,000.\n\nHmm, this seems complicated but maybe manageable. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: a\u00b3\n\nSecond term: a\u00b2*(300 - 2a) = 300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3\n\nThird term: a*(300 - 2a)^2. Let me expand (300 - 2a)^2 first:\n\n(300)^2 - 2*300*2a + (2a)^2 = 90,000 - 1,200a + 4a\u00b2\n\nTherefore, third term is a*(90,000 - 1,200a + 4a\u00b2) = 90,000a - 1,200a\u00b2 + 4a\u00b3\n\nNow, adding all three terms together:\n\na\u00b3 + (300a\u00b2 - 2a\u00b3) + (90,000a - 1,200a\u00b2 + 4a\u00b3)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\na\u00b3 - 2a\u00b3 + 4a\u00b3 = 3a\u00b3\n\n300a\u00b2 - 1,200a\u00b2 = -900a\u00b2\n\nAnd the linear term is 90,000a.\n\nSo overall:\n\n3a\u00b3 - 900a\u00b2 + 90,000a = 3,000,000.\n\nDivide both sides by 3:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a = 1,000,000.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Maybe factor it? Let's see if there are integer roots. Let me try possible integer values for a. Since a is a nonnegative integer and c = 300 - 2a must also be nonnegative, so 300 - 2a \u2265 0 \u21d2 a \u2264 150. So a can be between 0 and 150.\n\nLet me try a = 100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0.\n\nHey, that works! So a = 100 is a root. Therefore, (a - 100) is a factor. Let me perform polynomial division or factor it out.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100):\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division. Let's use synthetic division with root 100.\n\nCoefficients: 1 (a\u00b3), -300 (a\u00b2), 30,000 (a), -1,000,000 (constant term).\n\nSet up synthetic division:\n\n100 | 1 \u00a0 -300 \u00a0 30000 \u00a0 -1000000\n\nStart:\n\nBring down 1.\n\nMultiply by 100: 1*100 = 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200.\n\nMultiply -200 by 100 = -20,000. Add to 30,000: 10,000.\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100 = 1,000,000. Add to -1,000,000: 0.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000). Let me check the quadratic:\n\na\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000. Let's see if it factors further.\n\nDiscriminant: 200\u00b2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So it's a perfect square. So the quadratic is (a - 100)^2. Therefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me recalculate.\n\nWait, the quadratic factor is a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000. Let's see if that's (a - 100)^2: (a - 100)^2 = a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000. Yes! So the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0. Therefore, the only real root is a = 100 (with multiplicity 3).\n\nTherefore, in this case where a = b, the only solution is a = 100, so then b = 100 and c = 300 - 2*100 = 100. So (a, b, c) = (100, 100, 100). Let me check if this satisfies the original equation.\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b. Since all are 100, each term is 100\u00b2*100 = 1,000,000. There are 6 terms, so total is 6,000,000. Yes, that works. So that's one solution.\n\nBut the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers\", so this is one solution where all three are equal. But are there other solutions where variables are not equal?\n\nHmm. Maybe there are other solutions where two variables are equal, but not all three? Wait, in the case above, when we set a = b, we found only the solution where all three are equal. So perhaps if we set a = b but not equal to c, but in that case, we saw that only a = 100 gives c = 100 as well, so no. So maybe symmetry requires that if two variables are equal, the third must be equal too?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where all variables are different. Let me consider that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can use the equation we had earlier: 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300,\n\nP = abc,\n\nand Q = ab + bc + ca.\n\nSo the equation is 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nBut we also know that for three variables,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo, 300\u00b2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 2Q.\n\nBut not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, perhaps express Q in terms of other variables?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of two variables. Let me set variables as a, b, and c = 300 - a - b.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nFirst, compute Q = ab + bc + ca.\n\nExpressed in terms of a and b:\n\nab + b*(300 - a - b) + a*(300 - a - b)\n\n= ab + 300b - ab - b\u00b2 + 300a - a\u00b2 - ab\n\nWait, let me compute step by step:\n\nFirst term: ab\n\nSecond term: b*c = b*(300 - a - b) = 300b - ab - b\u00b2\n\nThird term: a*c = a*(300 - a - b) = 300a - a\u00b2 - ab\n\nAdding all three together:\n\nab + (300b - ab - b\u00b2) + (300a - a\u00b2 - ab)\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nab - ab - ab = -ab\n\n300b + 300a = 300(a + b)\n\n- b\u00b2 - a\u00b2\n\nSo overall:\n\nQ = -ab - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 300(a + b)\n\nSimilarly, P = abc = a*b*(300 - a - b)\n\nSo substituting into the equation 100Q - P = 2,000,000:\n\n100*(-ab - a\u00b2 - b\u00b2 + 300(a + b)) - [a*b*(300 - a - b)] = 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, this is getting quite involved. Let me see if I can rearrange terms or find a substitution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the given equation and the sum a + b + c = 300 can lead to a relationship that variables must be in an arithmetic progression or something. Wait, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of variables as x, y, z with x = a, y = b, z = c, and perhaps use substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the case where one variable is 0. Suppose c = 0, then a + b = 300, and the equation becomes a\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0 + 0 = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab*300 = 6,000,000.\n\nSo ab*300 = 6,000,000 \u21d2 ab = 20,000.\n\nSo if c = 0, then a and b are nonnegative integers with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. Let's see if this is possible.\n\nWe can set up the quadratic equation: Let a and b be roots of x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0.\n\nDiscriminant: 300\u00b2 - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.\n\nSquare root of discriminant is 100. So roots are [300 \u00b1 100]/2 = (400)/2 = 200 or (200)/2 = 100.\n\nTherefore, a and b are 200 and 100. So the triples would be (200, 100, 0) and (100, 200, 0). Also, since c can be any of the variables, we need to consider permutations. So if c = 0, then the solutions are permutations of (200, 100, 0). So how many permutations are there?\n\nThere are 3 variables, so the non-zero elements can be arranged in 3 positions for the 0. For each of those, the 200 and 100 can be in the other two positions. So total of 3 * 2 = 6 solutions.\n\nWait, but (200, 100, 0), (200, 0, 100), (100, 200, 0), (100, 0, 200), (0, 200, 100), (0, 100, 200). Yes, that's 6 triples where one variable is 0, and the other two are 200 and 100. So that's 6 solutions.\n\nAdditionally, the case where all variables are equal, which is (100,100,100), so that's another solution. So so far, we have 7 solutions. But are there more?\n\nWait, let me check if there are other cases where one variable is zero but with different a and b. Wait, when c = 0, we found that the only solutions are those with a=200, b=100 or vice versa. So that's the only solution in that case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there are solutions where two variables are zero? Let's check that. Suppose two variables are zero, say b = c = 0, then a = 300. Then the expression becomes a\u00b2b + ... but all terms would be zero since b and c are zero. So that gives 0 \u2260 6,000,000. So that's invalid. Similarly, any two variables being zero would lead to the expression being zero, which is too small. So two variables can't be zero.\n\nSo only one variable can be zero, leading to 6 solutions as above.\n\nNow, are there solutions where none of the variables are zero? Let me see.\n\nSuppose all a, b, c are positive integers. Let me see if there are such triples.\n\nWe already have the all-100 solution. Let me see if there are others.\n\nLet me consider another approach. Let me recall the equation we had earlier:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me rearrange this as abc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm. Let me see if I can factor this equation or find some relation.\n\nAlternatively, let me divide both sides by abc (assuming none are zero):\n\n1 = 100(1/c + 1/a + 1/b) - 2,000,000/(abc).\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables as x = a, y = b, z = c, so x + y + z = 300, and the equation is 100(xy + yz + zx) - xyz = 2,000,000.\n\nPerhaps, let me denote variables as x, y, z. Let me think of this equation and see if I can find another symmetric solution or another set of values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe assume two variables are equal but not all three. Suppose a = b \u2260 c. Wait, earlier when I assumed a = b, the only solution was a = b = c. So perhaps there are no solutions where two variables are equal but not all three?\n\nWait, in that case, when I set a = b, the equation forced c to also be equal. So maybe that's the only solution when two variables are equal.\n\nAlternatively, let me try some numerical examples.\n\nSuppose a = 150, b = 150, c = 0. But then c is zero, which we already considered. The expression would be a\u00b2b + ... but let me check:\n\nWait, if a = 150, b = 150, c = 0, then the expression is (150)^2*150 + (150)^2*0 + (150)^2*150 + ... Wait, actually, let me compute it properly.\n\nWait, a = 150, b = 150, c = 0:\n\na\u00b2b = 150\u00b2*150 = 150^3\n\na\u00b2c = 150\u00b2*0 = 0\n\nSimilarly, b\u00b2a = 150\u00b2*150 = same as a\u00b2b, so 150^3\n\nb\u00b2c = 0\n\nc\u00b2a and c\u00b2b are 0.\n\nThen total expression is 150^3 + 150^3 = 2*(3,375,000) = 6,750,000 which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too big. So that's not a solution.\n\nHmm. Let me try another example. Suppose a = 120, b = 180, c = 0. Then ab = 120*180 = 21,600. So 21,600 * 300 = 6,480,000. Wait, but if c = 0, then the expression is a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab*300. So if a + b = 300, then the total is 300ab. So setting 300ab = 6,000,000 gives ab = 20,000, which was the case when a and b are 200 and 100. So that's the only solution with c=0. So other splits would not work.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider a case where all variables are different and non-zero.\n\nSuppose a=100, b=100, c=100 is already considered. What if a=150, b=100, c=50. Let me compute the expression:\n\na + b + c = 150+100+50=300. Good.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = 150\u00b2*100 = 22500*100 = 2,250,000\n\na\u00b2c = 150\u00b2*50 = 22500*50 = 1,125,000\n\nb\u00b2a = 100\u00b2*150 = 10,000*150 = 1,500,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 100\u00b2*50 = 10,000*50 = 500,000\n\nc\u00b2a = 50\u00b2*150 = 2,500*150 = 375,000\n\nc\u00b2b = 50\u00b2*100 = 2,500*100 = 250,000\n\nAdding all these up:\n\n2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 \u2192 4,875,000\n\n+500,000 \u2192 5,375,000\n\n+375,000 \u2192 5,750,000\n\n+250,000 \u2192 6,000,000.\n\nWait, that adds up to exactly 6,000,000! So (150, 100, 50) is another solution. Interesting. So this is a solution where all three variables are different. Therefore, there are more solutions than just the symmetric one and the ones with a zero.\n\nHmm, so my earlier assumption that setting two variables equal only gives the symmetric solution might not be the only case. Let me see how this works.\n\nWait, so in this case, (150,100,50) is a solution. Let me check the equation for this triple.\n\nFirst, a + b + c = 150 + 100 + 50 = 300, good.\n\nThe expression gives 6,000,000 as above, so that's valid. So that's another solution.\n\nNow, how many permutations of this are there?\n\nThe numbers 150, 100, 50 are all distinct, so the number of permutations is 3! = 6. So that adds 6 more solutions.\n\nWait, so that gives 6 more, so total so far is 6 (from the zero case) + 1 (all 100s) + 6 (from 150,100,50) = 13? Wait, but maybe there are more such triples?\n\nHmm, let me see if there are other triples with distinct numbers.\n\nLet me try another set. Let me see if there's another combination.\n\nSuppose a = 200, b = 50, c = 50. Let me check.\n\nSum: 200+50+50=300. Good.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\na\u00b2b = 200\u00b2*50 = 40,000*50 = 2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b = 2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a = 50\u00b2*200 = 2,500*200 = 500,000\n\nb\u00b2c = same as b\u00b2a = 500,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a = 500,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c = 500,000\n\nWait, let me compute each term step by step:\n\na\u00b2b = (200)^2 *50 = 40000*50 = 2,000,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as above = 2,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a = (50)^2 *200 = 2500*200 = 500,000\n\nb\u00b2c = (50)^2 *50 = 2500*50 = 125,000\n\nWait, hold on, c is 50, so b\u00b2c is (50)^2 *50? Wait, b is 50, c is 50. So b\u00b2c = (50)^2 *50 = 125,000. Wait, but c\u00b2a would be (50)^2 *200 = 500,000.\n\nSimilarly, c\u00b2b = (50)^2 *50 = 125,000. Wait, so adding all terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = 2,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 4,000,000\n\nb\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = 500,000 + 125,000 = 625,000\n\nc\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 500,000 + 125,000 = 625,000\n\nTotal: 4,000,000 + 625,000 + 625,000 = 5,250,000. Which is less than 6,000,000. So that's not a solution.\n\nHmm, okay. Maybe that's not a solution. Let me try another set. Let me think of variables where two are equal but not all three. Wait, earlier when I set a = b, I ended up with all equal, but maybe there's another way?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another triple similar to (150,100,50). Let me suppose a = 200, b = 100, c = 0, but that's already covered in the zero case. Alternatively, maybe (250, 50, 0) but let's see:\n\na + b + c = 250 + 50 + 0 = 300. The expression would be a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + ... but c=0:\n\na\u00b2b = 250\u00b2*50 = 62,500*50 = 3,125,000\n\na\u00b2c = 0\n\nb\u00b2a = 50\u00b2*250 = 2,500*250 = 625,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 0\n\nc\u00b2a and c\u00b2b =0\n\nTotal: 3,125,000 + 625,000 = 3,750,000 < 6,000,000. Not enough.\n\nHmm. Let me think of another approach. Since I found that (150, 100, 50) works, perhaps there are other triples in arithmetic progression? Let's see. The numbers 50,100,150 are in arithmetic progression with common difference 50. Let me see if triples like 100, 100, 100 (which is a special case of that), and 50,100,150 are the only ones?\n\nWait, let me try another arithmetic progression. Let's say with difference 25: 75, 100, 125. Their sum is 300. Let's check the expression:\n\na=75, b=100, c=125.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b = 75\u00b2*100 = 5625*100 = 562,500\n\na\u00b2c = 75\u00b2*125 = 5625*125 = 703,125\n\nb\u00b2a = 100\u00b2*75 = 10,000*75 = 750,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 100\u00b2*125 = 1,250,000\n\nc\u00b2a = 125\u00b2*75 = 15,625*75 = 1,171,875\n\nc\u00b2b = 125\u00b2*100 = 15,625*100 = 1,562,500\n\nAdding all these:\n\n562,500 + 703,125 = 1,265,625\n\n+750,000 = 2,015,625\n\n+1,250,000 = 3,265,625\n\n+1,171,875 = 4,437,500\n\n+1,562,500 = 6,000,000.\n\nWait, that adds up to exactly 6,000,000! So (75, 100, 125) is another solution. So that's another triple in arithmetic progression with difference 25. Interesting. So permutations of this would also be solutions. Since all are distinct, there are 6 permutations. So that adds another 6 solutions.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that there might be multiple arithmetic progression triples. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nLooking at the first non-symmetric solution (150,100,50): differences are 50 each. The second one (75,100,125): differences of 25 each. Let's see if this can be generalized.\n\nSuppose that the three numbers form an arithmetic progression with common difference d, so let the numbers be (100 - d, 100, 100 + d). Then their sum is (100 - d) + 100 + (100 + d) = 300, which works. Let me see what the expression evaluates to.\n\nLet me denote a = 100 - d, b = 100, c = 100 + d.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst, a\u00b2b = (100 - d)^2 * 100\n\na\u00b2c = (100 - d)^2 * (100 + d)\n\nb\u00b2a = 100\u00b2 * (100 - d)\n\nb\u00b2c = 100\u00b2 * (100 + d)\n\nc\u00b2a = (100 + d)^2 * (100 - d)\n\nc\u00b2b = (100 + d)^2 * 100\n\nLet me compute each term step by step.\n\nFirst term: (100 - d)^2 * 100\n\nSecond term: (100 - d)^2*(100 + d) = (100 - d)^2*(100 + d)\n\nThird term: 100\u00b2*(100 - d) = 10,000*(100 - d)\n\nFourth term: 100\u00b2*(100 + d) = 10,000*(100 + d)\n\nFifth term: (100 + d)^2*(100 - d)\n\nSixth term: (100 + d)^2*100\n\nHmm, this seems complex, but maybe we can combine terms.\n\nLet me group terms:\n\nTerms 1 and 6: a\u00b2b + c\u00b2b = b(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = 100[(100 - d)^2 + (100 + d)^2]\n\nTerms 2 and 5: a\u00b2c + c\u00b2a = a c (a + c) = (100 - d)(100 + d)[(100 - d) + (100 + d)] = (100\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(200)\n\nTerms 3 and 4: b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c) = 100\u00b2*(200)\n\nTherefore, total expression is:\n\n100[(100 - d)^2 + (100 + d)^2] + (100\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(200) + 100\u00b2*200\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst part: 100[(100 - d)^2 + (100 + d)^2]\n\nExpand (100 - d)^2 = 10,000 - 200d + d\u00b2\n\n(100 + d)^2 = 10,000 + 200d + d\u00b2\n\nAdding them: 20,000 + 2d\u00b2\n\nMultiply by 100: 100*(20,000 + 2d\u00b2) = 2,000,000 + 200d\u00b2\n\nSecond part: (100\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(200) = (10,000 - d\u00b2)*200 = 2,000,000 - 200d\u00b2\n\nThird part: 100\u00b2*200 = 10,000*200 = 2,000,000\n\nNow add all three parts:\n\nFirst part + second part: (2,000,000 + 200d\u00b2) + (2,000,000 - 200d\u00b2) = 4,000,000\n\nAdd third part: 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nWow! So regardless of the value of d, the expression equals 6,000,000. That's fascinating. Therefore, any arithmetic progression centered at 100 with common difference d will satisfy the equation. So as long as the three numbers are in arithmetic progression with average 100, their sum is 300, and the expression will be 6,000,000. So that means there are infinitely many such triples? Wait, but since a, b, c must be nonnegative integers, d must be such that all terms are nonnegative.\n\nSo the terms are 100 - d, 100, 100 + d. To ensure nonnegativity:\n\n100 - d \u2265 0 \u21d2 d \u2264 100,\n\nand 100 + d can be any as long as d is nonnegative. But since d is a nonnegative integer (since a, b, c are integers), d can be 0, 1, 2, ..., 100.\n\nWait, but when d = 0, all terms are 100, which is the symmetric solution we found earlier.\n\nWhen d = 50, we get (50, 100, 150), which is the first non-symmetric solution.\n\nWhen d =25, we get (75, 100, 125), which was another solution.\n\nSimilarly, d=10 would give (90, 100, 110), which would also satisfy the equation.\n\nTherefore, all triples where the three numbers form an arithmetic progression centered at 100 are solutions, as long as they are nonnegative integers.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of d are integers from 0 to 100 inclusive. However, when d=0, all three numbers are equal (100,100,100). For d from 1 to 100, each gives a distinct triple where the numbers are in AP. However, we need to ensure that all three numbers are nonnegative integers. Since d can be any integer from 0 up to 100, the number of such triples would be 101 (from d=0 to d=100). But each d from 1 to 100 gives two distinct triples except when d=0? Wait, no. Wait, when d is varied, each d corresponds to a unique triple, but when you consider permutations, actually, for each d \u22600, the triple (100 -d, 100, 100 +d) can be permuted in different ways. Wait, but in the arithmetic progression, the order is fixed as (small, middle, large). However, the problem counts triples (a,b,c) where order matters. So each arithmetic progression with difference d (for d from 0 to 100) gives 6 permutations unless there are duplicates.\n\nWait, actually, for each d \u22600, the three numbers are distinct, so each such triple can be arranged in 6 different orders. However, when d =0, the triple is (100,100,100), which only has one arrangement.\n\nWait, but in our earlier examples, like (150, 100, 50), which corresponds to d=50, when we permute it, we get all permutations of those three numbers, which are 6 different triples. Similarly for d=25, etc. So actually, each d from 1 to 100 corresponds to 6 triples, and d=0 corresponds to 1 triple. But wait, but if d and -d give the same set? Wait, no. Because d is nonnegative. Since we defined d as the common difference such that the terms are 100 - d, 100, 100 + d, so d is nonnegative. So each d from 0 to 100 gives exactly one unordered triple. But since the problem counts ordered triples, each unordered triple (except the all-100 case) corresponds to 6 ordered triples.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples from the arithmetic progression solutions would be:\n\nFor d from 1 to 100: each gives 6 ordered triples,\n\nplus the single triple when d=0.\n\nThus total is 100*6 +1= 601? Wait, but hold on.\n\nWait, but when d=100, the terms would be 0, 100, 200. So that's a valid triple (0,100,200). But this is actually part of the case where one variable is zero. Wait, but earlier when we considered the case with a zero, we found triples like (200,100,0), which is the same as (0,100,200) when permuted. So in the arithmetic progression approach, d=100 gives (0,100,200), which is already included in the case where one variable is zero (which gives 6 permutations). So this suggests that the arithmetic progression approach includes those cases where one variable is zero, but when we considered them earlier, we found that those cases only have solutions where the two non-zero numbers multiply to 20,000. Let me check for d=100: the numbers are 0,100,200. Then their product terms: a=0, b=100, c=200. Then ab + bc + ca = 0*100 + 100*200 + 200*0 = 20,000. Then 100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 100*(20,000) - 0 = 2,000,000, which matches the equation. So yes, that works. So in effect, the arithmetic progression approach includes all the solutions where variables are in AP, including those with a zero. So when we calculated the case with a zero variable, we found exactly those solutions where the non-zero terms form an AP with difference 100 (for example, 100 and 200 differ by 100, but the zero is part of the AP as the first term). Wait, actually, in the case of d=100, the AP is 0, 100, 200, so difference 100. So indeed, all those cases are included here.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples from the arithmetic progression approach is (101 values of d: 0 to 100) each contributing ordered triples. Wait, but actually for each d from 1 to 100, the unordered triple can be arranged in 6 ways, so 6 triples per d. For d=0, it's only 1 triple. So total triples from AP would be 100*6 +1 = 601. But wait, but earlier when we considered the zero case, we had 6 solutions. The arithmetic progression for d=100 gives exactly those 6 permutations of (0,100,200). Similarly, d=50 gives permutations of (50,100,150), which are 6 solutions. Similarly for d=25, permutations of (75,100,125). So all these are covered in the arithmetic progression approach. Therefore, the total number of triples from the arithmetic progression is indeed 601? Wait, but hold on. Let me check for d=50: the numbers are 50,100,150. That's one unordered triple, which can be permuted in 6 ways, so 6 ordered triples. Similarly for each d from 1 to 100, so 100*6, plus the one where d=0. So total 601.\n\nHowever, wait, when d=0, it's (100,100,100), which is one triple.\n\nBut is there any overlap? For example, when d=50, the triple (50,100,150) is distinct from triples from other d's. So no overlaps except for the zero case, which is already counted in d=100. So total is indeed 601.\n\nBut wait, but in the problem statement, we need nonnegative integers. So when d is from 0 to 100, inclusive, then yes, all terms are nonnegative. So that would give 101 values of d, each giving a distinct unordered triple, and when considering ordered triples, except for the case d=0, each gives 6 ordered triples. So total is 101 + (100 *5) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, sorry, if each d from 1 to 100 gives 6 ordered triples, and d=0 gives 1, then total is 1 + 100*6 = 601. That seems right.\n\nBut earlier, I found another solution: (150,100,50) which is part of d=50, so that's accounted for here. Similarly, the (75,100,125) is part of d=25, so that's included.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check if there are any other solutions outside of these arithmetic progressions. Suppose I take a triple that is not in an arithmetic progression. Let me see if that can satisfy the equation.\n\nSuppose a=120, b= 120, c=60. Sum is 300. Let me compute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nFirst, a\u00b2b = 120\u00b2*120 = 120^3 = 1,728,000\n\na\u00b2c = 120\u00b2*60 = 14,400*60 = 864,000\n\nb\u00b2a = same as a\u00b2b =1,728,000\n\nb\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2c =864,000\n\nc\u00b2a = 60\u00b2*120 = 3,600*120 = 432,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as c\u00b2a =432,000\n\nTotal:\n\n1,728,000 + 864,000 = 2,592,000\n\n+1,728,000 = 4,320,000\n\n+864,000 = 5,184,000\n\n+432,000 = 5,616,000\n\n+432,000 = 6,048,000. Not 6,000,000. Close but not quite.\n\nHmm, so that's not a solution. Let me try another one. Suppose a= 140, b=100, c=60. Sum is 300.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b =140\u00b2*100 =19,600*100=1,960,000\n\na\u00b2c =140\u00b2*60 =19,600*60=1,176,000\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*140=1,000,000*140=140,000,000? Wait, no. Wait, 100\u00b2 is 10,000, so 10,000*140 = 1,400,000.\n\nb\u00b2c =100\u00b2*60 =10,000*60=600,000\n\nc\u00b2a=60\u00b2*140=3,600*140=504,000\n\nc\u00b2b=60\u00b2*100=3,600*100=360,000\n\nAdding up:\n\n1,960,000 +1,176,000 =3,136,000\n\n+1,400,000 =4,536,000\n\n+600,000 =5,136,000\n\n+504,000 =5,640,000\n\n+360,000 =6,000,000.\n\nWait, that works! So (140,100,60) is another solution. But is this an arithmetic progression?\n\nCheck if they form an arithmetic progression. Let's see:\n\nThe numbers are 60,100,140. The differences are 40 and 40. So yes! 60,100,140 is an arithmetic progression with common difference 40. So d=40 here. So that is included in the arithmetic progression solutions. So that's covered.\n\nTherefore, every time I try a triple that works, it turns out to be part of an arithmetic progression centered at 100. So perhaps all solutions are exactly the arithmetic progression triples. Therefore, the total number of triples is 601?\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another example. Suppose d= 30. Then the triple is 70,100,130. Let's check if that works.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na=70, b=100, c=130.\n\na\u00b2b =70\u00b2*100 =4,900*100=490,000\n\na\u00b2c =70\u00b2*130 =4,900*130=637,000\n\nb\u00b2a=100\u00b2*70=10,000*70=700,000\n\nb\u00b2c=100\u00b2*130=10,000*130=1,300,000\n\nc\u00b2a=130\u00b2*70=16,900*70=1,183,000\n\nc\u00b2b=130\u00b2*100=16,900*100=1,690,000\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n490,000 + 637,000 = 1,127,000\n\n+700,000 =1,827,000\n\n+1,300,000 =3,127,000\n\n+1,183,000 =4,310,000\n\n+1,690,000 =6,000,000. Perfect, it works. So indeed, all arithmetic progression triples work.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion is that all solutions are the triples where a, b, c form an arithmetic progression centered at 100 (i.e., their average is 100), and the number of such triples is calculated as follows:\n\nEach arithmetic progression is determined by the common difference d, which can be from 0 to 100. For each d from 1 to 100, there are 6 permutations of the triple (100 - d, 100, 100 + d). For d=0, there's only one triple (100, 100, 100).\n\nTherefore, total number of triples is 1 + 100*6 = 601.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Let me check if all these triples are distinct. For example, when d=50, the triple is (50,100,150). When d=100, it's (0,100,200). These are all distinct triples. However, when d and another d' produce the same set of numbers? For instance, is there a case where different d's lead to the same triple?\n\nSuppose d1 and d2 such that 100 - d1 = 100 + d2, but that would require -d1 = d2, but since d is non-negative, this can't happen unless d1=d2=0. So no overlaps. Therefore, each d from 0 to 100 gives a unique unordered triple. So the count is correct.\n\nHowever, the problem states \"nonnegative integers\", so when d=100, the first term is 0, which is allowed. So yes, all d from 0 to 100 are valid.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 1 + 6*100 = 601. However, wait, let me confirm with the earlier examples. When d=50, that gives 6 triples, like (50,100,150), (50,150,100), etc., each permutation. Similarly for d=25, etc. So yes, 6 per d from 1 to 100, plus 1 for d=0. So total 601.\n\nWait, but in the earlier case where we considered triples with a zero (i.e., d=100), that gives 6 triples, which are included in the 601. Similarly, the all-100 case is included. So that seems to cover everything.\n\nBut wait, let me think again: the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so zero is allowed. So yes, all those are valid.\n\nBut let me check if there are any other solutions outside of the arithmetic progression triples. Suppose I take a triple that is not in an arithmetic progression. Let me try (100, 100, 100): that's arithmetic progression with d=0. So it's included. How about (120, 100, 80). That is an arithmetic progression with d=20. So included. Let me try a triple that's not in AP: say (110, 100, 90). That is an arithmetic progression with d=10. So also included. Wait, actually any three numbers with average 100 must form an arithmetic progression? Wait, no. Wait, if three numbers have an average of 100, their sum is 300. If they form an arithmetic progression, then they must be equally spaced around 100. But if they are not equally spaced, but still sum to 300, they might not form an AP. Let me see.\n\nLet me try an example: (90, 100, 110). That's an AP with d=10. Now, what about (80, 110, 110)? Their sum is 300. Are they in an AP? Let's see: 80, 110, 110. The differences are 30 and 0, so not an AP. Let me check if this is a solution.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na=80, b=110, c=110.\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nFirst terms:\n\na\u00b2b = 80\u00b2*110 = 6,400*110 = 704,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b =704,000\n\nb\u00b2a =110\u00b2*80 = 12,100*80 = 968,000\n\nb\u00b2c =110\u00b2*110 = 12,100*110 = 1,331,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a =968,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c =1,331,000\n\nNow adding all terms:\n\n704,000 +704,000 =1,408,000\n\n+968,000 =2,376,000\n\n+1,331,000 =3,707,000\n\n+968,000 =4,675,000\n\n+1,331,000 =6,006,000. Hmm, which is 6,006,000, not 6,000,000. Close but not equal. So that's not a solution.\n\nTherefore, this triple doesn't work, which is good because it's not an arithmetic progression. So only the arithmetic progression triples work.\n\nTherefore, I think it's safe to say that all solutions are exactly the arithmetic progression triples. Thus the total number is 601.\n\nWait, but let me check another non-AP triple. Let's say (100, 150, 50) which is AP, but suppose I take (99, 101, 100). Wait, that is an AP with d=1. So that's included.\n\nAlternatively, suppose I have a triple like (120, 90, 90). Their sum is 300. Are they in AP? 90,90,120. The differences are 0 and 30, so no. Let's compute the expression:\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\na\u00b2b =120\u00b2*90 =14,400*90=1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b =1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a =90\u00b2*120 =8,100*120=972,000\n\nb\u00b2c =90\u00b2*90 =8,100*90=729,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a =972,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c =729,000\n\nTotal:\n\n1,296,000 +1,296,000 =2,592,000\n\n+972,000 =3,564,000\n\n+729,000 =4,293,000\n\n+972,000 =5,265,000\n\n+729,000 =6,000,000.\n\nWait, that adds up to exactly 6,000,000! But this triple is (120,90,90). Are these in an arithmetic progression?\n\nLet me see: 90,90,120. The differences are 0 and 30. Not an arithmetic progression. Wait, but according to the calculation, this triple also works. But according to our previous logic, it shouldn't.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. This contradicts our previous conclusion. Let me verify the calculation again:\n\nWait, let's recalculate for (120,90,90):\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = (120)^2*90 = 14,400 *90 = 1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b =1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a = (90)^2*120 = 8,100 *120 = 972,000\n\nb\u00b2c = (90)^2*90 = 8,100*90 = 729,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a =972,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c =729,000\n\nNow add them:\n\n1,296,000 + 1,296,000 = 2,592,000\n\n+972,000 = 3,564,000\n\n+729,000 = 4,293,000\n\n+972,000 = 5,265,000\n\n+729,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nYes, it does add up. So this triple (120,90,90) is a solution but is not an arithmetic progression. So my previous conclusion was wrong. There are solutions outside of arithmetic progressions.\n\nHmm, so my mistake was assuming all solutions are arithmetic progressions, but apparently there are others.\n\nSo I need to rethink this.\n\nLet me see why this triple works. Let me check the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nFor the triple (120,90,90):\n\nCompute ab + bc + ca:\n\nab = 120*90 = 10,800\n\nbc = 90*90 = 8,100\n\nca = 90*120 = 10,800\n\nTotal Q = 10,800 + 8,100 + 10,800 = 29,700\n\nabc = 120*90*90 = 120*8,100 = 972,000\n\nThen 100*29,700 - 972,000 = 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000. Wait, but that's not equal to 2,000,000. Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, something is wrong here.\n\nWait, hold on, the problem states that the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. But according to the previous calculation, that triple gives exactly 6,000,000, but according to this equation, it's not satisfying 100Q - abc = 2,000,000. There must be an error in my calculations.\n\nLet me recalculate Q and abc for (120,90,90):\n\nQ = ab + bc + ca = (120\u00d790)+(90\u00d790)+(90\u00d7120) = 10,800 + 8,100 + 10,800 = 29,700.\n\nabc = 120\u00d790\u00d790 = 120\u00d78,100 = 972,000.\n\nThen 100\u00d729,700 = 2,970,000.\n\n2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000, which is not equal to 2,000,000. So there is a discrepancy here. But when I computed the original expression, I got 6,000,000. Let me recalculate the original expression.\n\nOriginal expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nBreaking down:\n\na\u00b2b = 120\u00b2\u00d790 = 14,400\u00d790 = 1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = 120\u00b2\u00d790 = same as above = 1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a = 90\u00b2\u00d7120 = 8,100\u00d7120 = 972,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 90\u00b2\u00d790 = 8,100\u00d790 = 729,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a = 972,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c = 729,000\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1,296,000 + 1,296,000 = 2,592,000\n\n+972,000 = 3,564,000\n\n+729,000 = 4,293,000\n\n+972,000 = 5,265,000\n\n+729,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's correct. But according to the equation 100Q - abc = 2,000,000, it should be 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000 \u2260 2,000,000. There's a contradiction here. Which means I must have made a mistake in my derivation earlier.\n\nWait, let's go back to the original equations. Let me rederive the relationship between the given expression and the equation I had.\n\nOriginal problem's expression:\n\nE = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nWe had earlier derived that:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = E + 3abc.\n\nTherefore, E = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nGiven that a + b + c = 300,\n\nE = 300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nTherefore, the equation given in the problem is:\n\n300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000.\n\nDividing both sides by 3:\n\n100*(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo for the triple (120, 90, 90):\n\nLeft-hand side: 100*29,700 - 972,000 = 2,970,000 - 972,000 = 1,998,000 \u2260 2,000,000. Which contradicts the original equation. But when we computed E directly, we got 6,000,000. That must mean that there's an error in the direct computation.\n\nWait, let me recalculate E for (120,90,90):\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = (120)^2 *90 = 14,400 *90 = 1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b =1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a = (90)^2 *120 = 8,100 *120 = 972,000\n\nb\u00b2c = (90)^2 *90 = 8,100 *90 = 729,000\n\nc\u00b2a = same as b\u00b2a =972,000\n\nc\u00b2b = same as b\u00b2c =729,000\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1,296,000 +1,296,000 = 2,592,000\n\n+972,000 = 3,564,000\n\n+729,000 = 4,293,000\n\n+972,000 = 5,265,000\n\n+729,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, that's correct, but according to the equation, it should not satisfy. Therefore, there's a mistake in my derivation?\n\nWait, let me recompute E using the formula:\n\nE = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo with a=120, b=90, c=90:\n\nab + bc + ca = (120\u00d790)+(90\u00d790)+(90\u00d7120) = 10,800 + 8,100 + 10,800 = 29,700.\n\n(a + b + c) = 300.\n\nSo 300\u00d729,700 = 8,910,000\n\n3abc = 3\u00d7120\u00d790\u00d790 = 3\u00d7972,000 = 2,916,000.\n\nTherefore, E = 8,910,000 - 2,916,000 = 5,994,000.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the direct calculation of 6,000,000. So there's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Which is correct?\n\nLet me compute E directly again:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = 120\u00b2\u00d790 + 120\u00b2\u00d790 = 2\u00d7(14400\u00d790) = 2\u00d71,296,000 = 2,592,000\n\nb\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = 90\u00b2\u00d7120 + 90\u00b2\u00d790 = (8100\u00d7120)+(8100\u00d790) = 972,000 + 729,000 = 1,701,000\n\nc\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 90\u00b2\u00d7120 + 90\u00b2\u00d790 = same as above, so another 1,701,000.\n\nWait, but hold on, c\u00b2a is 90\u00b2\u00d7120 = same as b\u00b2a, yes. Similarly c\u00b2b is 90\u00b2\u00d790 same as b\u00b2c. Therefore total:\n\n2,592,000 (a\u00b2 terms) + 1,701,000 (b\u00b2 terms) + 1,701,000 (c\u00b2 terms) ?\n\nWait, no, no, no. Wait, the terms are:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nBreaking down:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c = a\u00b2(b + c) = 120\u00b2*(90 + 90) = 14,400*180 = 2,592,000\n\nb\u00b2a + b\u00b2c = b\u00b2(a + c) = 90\u00b2*(120 + 90) = 8,100*210 = 1,701,000\n\nc\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = c\u00b2(a + b) = 90\u00b2*(120 + 90) = same as above = 1,701,000\n\nTotal E = 2,592,000 + 1,701,000 + 1,701,000 = 2,592,000 + 3,402,000 = 6,  (2,592 + 3,402) = 6,000? Wait, 2,592,000 + 3,402,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nBut according to the formula, E should be 5,994,000. So which is correct?\n\nWait, let me recompute via the formula:\n\nE = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\n= 300\u00d729,700 - 3\u00d7(120\u00d790\u00d790)\n\n= 300\u00d729,700 = 8,910,000\n\n3\u00d7120\u00d790\u00d790 = 3\u00d7120\u00d78,100 = 3\u00d7972,000 = 2,916,000\n\nSo 8,910,000 - 2,916,000 = 5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation gives 6,000,000. There is a discrepancy of 6,000. So there must be an error in one of the calculations.\n\nWait, let me check the direct computation again:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c: 120\u00b2\u00d790 + 120\u00b2\u00d790 = 2\u00d714,400\u00d790 = 2\u00d71,296,000 = 2,592,000.\n\nb\u00b2a + b\u00b2c: 90\u00b2\u00d7120 + 90\u00b2\u00d790 = 8,100\u00d7120 + 8,100\u00d790.\n\n8,100\u00d7120 = 972,000.\n\n8,100\u00d790 = 729,000.\n\nTotal for b terms: 972k + 729k = 1,701,000.\n\nc\u00b2a + c\u00b2b: same as b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c because c is 90, same as b. So also 1,701,000.\n\nTotal E: 2,592k + 1,701k +1,701k = 2,592k + 3,402k = 6,000k.\n\nHmm, so that's correct. Therefore, the formula must have been applied incorrectly.\n\nWait, the formula says E = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nWait, let me recalculate (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\na + b + c = 300\n\nab + bc + ca = 29,700\n\nThus, 300\u00d729,700 = 300\u00d729,700.\n\nWait 300\u00d729,700 = 300\u00d729,700 = let's compute 29,700\u00d7300:\n\n29,700 \u00d7 300 = 29,700 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 100 = 89,100 \u00d7 100 = 8,910,000. That's correct.\n\n3abc = 3\u00d7120\u00d790\u00d790 = 3\u00d7120\u00d78,100 = 3\u00d7972,000 = 2,916,000.\n\n8,910,000 - 2,916,000 = 5,994,000.\n\nWait, but direct computation says 6,000,000. There's a discrepancy of 6,000. So where is the error?\n\nWait, maybe my formula is wrong. Let me re-derive it.\n\nOriginal expansion:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + 3abc.\n\nWait, let me re-express:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\n= a\u00b2b + a b c + a\u00b2c + a b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + b c a + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a.\n\nWait, grouping terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b + 3abc.\n\nTherefore, indeed:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = E + 3abc \u21d2 E = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo the formula is correct. Therefore, the discrepancy must be in arithmetic.\n\nWait, let me recompute E directly again:\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\nCompute each term:\n\na\u00b2b = 120^2 * 90 = (14,400) * 90 = 1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b = 1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a = 90\u00b2 * 120 = 8,100 * 120 = 972,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 90\u00b2 * 90 = 8,100 * 90 = 729,000\n\nc\u00b2a = 90\u00b2 * 120 = same as b\u00b2a = 972,000\n\nc\u00b2b = 90\u00b2 * 90 = same as b\u00b2c = 729,000\n\nNow adding all terms:\n\n1,296,000 (a\u00b2b) +\n\n1,296,000 (a\u00b2c) = 2,592,000\n\n+972,000 (b\u00b2a) = 3,564,000\n\n+729,000 (b\u00b2c) = 4,293,000\n\n+972,000 (c\u00b2a) = 5,265,000\n\n+729,000 (c\u00b2b) = 6,000,000.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the formula must have an error?\n\nWait, let me recompute 3abc:\n\nabc =120\u00d790\u00d790 = 120\u00d78,100 = 972,000.\n\n3abc = 2,916,000.\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = 300\u00d729,700 =8,910,000.\n\nSubtracting 3abc gives 8,910,000 - 2,916,000 =5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation says 6,000,000. There is a 6,000 difference. Hmm. Where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ab + bc + ca?\n\nLet me compute ab + bc + ca again:\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\nab = 120\u00d790 =10,800\n\nbc =90\u00d790=8,100\n\nca =90\u00d7120=10,800\n\nTotal: 10,800 +8,100 +10,800 =29,700. That's correct.\n\nHmm. So why the discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me recompute the formula step-by-step.\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\nFirst compute (a + b + c) =300,\n\n(ab + bc + ca)=29,700,\n\nSo 300\u00d729,700 = ?\n\nLet me compute 29,700 \u00d7 300:\n\n29,700 \u00d7 300 = 29,700 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 100 = 89,100 \u00d7 100 = 8,910,000. That's correct.\n\nThen subtract 3abc=2,916,000,\n\n8,910,000 -2,916,000 =5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation says 6,000,000. So this is a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the direct computation. Let me compute each term again:\n\na\u00b2b =120\u00b2\u00d790:\n\n120 squared is 14,400. 14,400 \u00d7 90:\n\n14,400 \u00d7 90: 14,400 \u00d7 9 = 129,600; times 10 is 1,296,000. Correct.\n\na\u00b2c = same, so total a\u00b2 terms: 2,592,000.\n\nb\u00b2a:90\u00b2\u00d7120:\n\n8100 \u00d7120: 8100\u00d7100=810,000; 8100\u00d720=162,000; total 972,000. Correct.\n\nb\u00b2c:8100\u00d790=729,000.\n\nc\u00b2a: same as b\u00b2a, so 972,000.\n\nc\u00b2b: same as b\u00b2c, so 729,000.\n\nAdding up:\n\n2,592,000 + 972,000 = 3,564,000.\n\nAdd 729,000 \u21924,293,000.\n\nAdd 972,000 \u21925,265,000.\n\nAdd 729,000 \u21926,000,000.\n\nHmm. So there must be a mistake in the formula derivation. Wait, let's re-derive it again.\n\nCompute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n= a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)\n\n= a\u00b2b + a b c + a\u00b2c + a b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + b c a + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + c\u00b2a.\n\nGrouping terms:\n\n= (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c) + (b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c) + (c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 3abc.\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed E + 3abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca).\n\nHence E = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nSo the formula is correct, so why discrepancy?\n\nWait, perhaps the given problem's expression is different?\n\nWait the problem's expression is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b, which is exactly E. So according to the problem's equation, that must equal 6,000,000.\n\nBut according to the formula, E = (300)(29,700) - 3\u00d7972,000 = 8,910,000 - 2,916,000 =5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation says 6,000,000. So there must be an error in the arithmetic in one of these.\n\nWait, perhaps my direct computation is wrong. Let me compute E again step by step:\n\nCompute all terms:\n\n1. a\u00b2b = 120\u00b2 * 90 = 14,400 * 90 = 1,296,000\n\n2. a\u00b2c = 120\u00b2 * 90 = 1,296,000\n\n3. b\u00b2a = 90\u00b2 * 120 = 8,100 * 120 = 972,000\n\n4. b\u00b2c = 90\u00b2 * 90 = 8,100 * 90 = 729,000\n\n5. c\u00b2a = 90\u00b2 * 120 = same as b\u00b2a = 972,000\n\n6. c\u00b2b = 90\u00b2 * 90 = same as b\u00b2c = 729,000\n\nAdding all terms:\n\n1+2: 2,592,000\n\n+3: 2,592,000 + 972,000 = 3,564,000\n\n+4: 3,564,000 + 729,000 = 4,293,000\n\n+5: 4,293,000 + 972,000 = 5,265,000\n\n+6: 5,265,000 + 729,000 = 6,000,000.\n\nHmm, so this is correct. Then the formula must be wrong? But that's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps I have misapplied the formula. Let me check with another example where I know it works.\n\nTake the triple (100,100,100):\n\nE = 6*(100^3) =6,000,000.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) -3abc = 300*(3*10000) -3*(1,000,000)= 300*30,000 -3,000,000 =9,000,000 -3,000,000 =6,000,000. Correct.\n\nAnother example, the triple (150,100,50):\n\nCompute using formula:\n\nab + bc + ca =150\u00d7100 +100\u00d750 +50\u00d7150 =15,000 +5,000 +7,500=27,500.\n\n3abc=3\u00d7150\u00d7100\u00d750=3\u00d7750,000=2,250,000.\n\nThen (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) -3abc =300\u00d727,500 -2,250,000=8,250,000 -2,250,000=6,000,000. Correct.\n\nNow, for the triple (120,90,90):\n\nAccording to formula, E should be5,994,000 but direct computation is6,000,000. There's a 6,000 difference. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\nWait, 300 \u00d729,700:\n\n29,700 \u00d7 300:\n\n29,700 \u00d7 100 =2,970,000,\n\n\u00d73 \u2192 8,910,000. Correct.\n\nThen subtract 3abc=2,916,000 gives 5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation gives6,000,000. The difference is6,000,000 -5,994,000=6,000.\n\nWait, maybe I made an error in computing ab + bc + ca?\n\nWait, ab =120\u00d790=10,800,\n\nbc=90\u00d790=8,100,\n\nca=90\u00d7120=10,800,\n\nTotal:10,800+8,100+10,800=29,700. Correct.\n\nHmm. This is perplexing. Unless there is a miscalculation in the direct computation that I can't see. Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the problem's expression? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triple (120,90,90) is not a solution. But according to direct computation, it is.\n\nWait, let me check with another method. Let me compute E using the formula and see:\n\nE = 300*(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc.\n\nWhich would be 300\u00d729,700 -3\u00d7972,000 =8,910,000 -2,916,000 =5,994,000.\n\nBut the problem says that E must be6,000,000. So this triple does not satisfy the equation. Therefore, my direct computation must be wrong. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the terms:\n\nWait, the expression is a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nLet me recompute each term carefully:\n\na=120, b=90, c=90.\n\na\u00b2b: 120 squared is14,400. 14,400 \u00d790=1,296,000.\n\na\u00b2c: same as above:1,296,000.\n\nb\u00b2a:90 squared is8,100. 8,100\u00d7120=972,000.\n\nb\u00b2c:8,100\u00d790=729,000.\n\nc\u00b2a:90 squared \u00d7120=8,100\u00d7120=972,000.\n\nc\u00b2b:90 squared \u00d790=8,100\u00d790=729,000.\n\nAdding them up:\n\n1,296,000 +1,296,000=2,592,000.\n\n+972,000=3,564,000.\n\n+729,000=4,293,000.\n\n+972,000=5,265,000.\n\n+729,000=6,000,000.\n\nWait, the calculation is correct. So the formula must be wrong?\n\nBut for the triple (100,100,100):\n\nFormula gives correct result. For (150,100,50) also correct. For (120,90,90) discrepancy. What's different here?\n\nWait, in the case of (120,90,90), perhaps one of the terms is miscalculated?\n\nWait, c\u00b2a is c squared times a: c is 90, so 90\u00b2\u00d7120 = 8,100\u00d7120=972,000. Correct.\n\nSimilarly c\u00b2b is 90\u00b2\u00d790=729,000.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have misunderstood the problem's expression. Let me recheck the problem statement:\n\n\"The number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c) satisfying a + b + c = 300 and a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000.\"\n\nYes, that's exactly what I used. So the problem is that according to the formula, this triple should not satisfy the equation, but according to direct computation, it does. This contradiction suggests there's an error in the formula derivation.\n\nWait, let me recompute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = E + 3abc.\n\nSo if E =6,000,000, then (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) =6,000,000 +3abc.\n\nIn the case of (120,90,90):\n\n6,000,000 +3\u00d7972,000 =6,000,000+2,916,000=8,916,000.\n\nBut (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=300\u00d729,700=8,910,000.\n\nSo 8,910,000 vs. 8,916,000. The difference is6,000. So the formula is off by exactly the discrepancy in E.\n\nThis suggests that either the formula is incorrect, or there's a miscalculation.\n\nWait, let me re-derive the expansion carefully:\n\nLet me expand (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\na*(ab) = a\u00b2b,\n\na*(bc) = abc,\n\na*(ca) = a\u00b2c,\n\nb*(ab) = ab\u00b2,\n\nb*(bc) = b\u00b2c,\n\nb*(ca) = abc,\n\nc*(ab) = abc,\n\nc*(bc) = b c\u00b2,\n\nc*(ca) = c\u00b2a.\n\nSo total terms:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + b c\u00b2 + 3abc.\n\nWait, I think I missed a term in my previous expansion.\n\nWait, c*(bc) is b c\u00b2, and c*(ca)=c\u00b2a. So the terms are:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + b c\u00b2 + 3abc.\n\nWait, but in the original problem's expression, the terms are a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nSo notice that the term bc\u00b2 is written as c\u00b2b, which is the same as b c\u00b2. Similarly, b\u00b2a is the same as ab\u00b2.\n\nThus, the expanded form is indeed E + 3abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca).\n\nTherefore, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the only possibility is that there is an arithmetic mistake in the direct computation. Let me try a different approach for (120,90,90):\n\nCompute E = a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b.\n\nGroup terms by variables:\n\nFor a:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) = a\u00b2*(90 + 90) =120\u00b2\u00d7180 =14,400\u00d7180 =2,592,000.\n\nFor b:\n\nb\u00b2(a + c) =90\u00b2\u00d7(120 +90)=8,100\u00d7210=1,701,000.\n\nFor c:\n\nc\u00b2(a + b)=90\u00b2\u00d7(120 +90)= same as b's term =1,701,000.\n\nTotal E =2,592,000+1,701,000+1,701,000=6,000,000.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the formula must be wrong?\n\nWait, but for this case:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=300\u00d729,700=8,910,000.\n\nE +3abc=6,000,000+3\u00d7972,000=6,000,000+2,916,000=8,916,000.\n\nThus 8,910,000 vs 8,916,000. The difference is 6,000.\n\nWait, so the formula is missing 6,000?\n\nThere must be an error in the expansion. Wait, let me re-express:\n\nWait, in the expansion:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + 3abc.\n\nWait, but in the problem's expression E, we have a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nNotice that:\n\nab\u00b2 is the same as b\u00b2a,\n\nbc\u00b2 is the same as c\u00b2b,\n\nand ac\u00b2 is the same as c\u00b2a.\n\nSo the terms in the expansion are exactly the terms in E plus 3abc. Therefore, the formula holds.\n\nThus, the discrepancy must be due to an arithmetic error in the example.\n\nWait, let me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) for (120,90,90):\n\nab + bc + ca =29,700.\n\n300\u00d729,700:\n\n29,700 \u00d7 300:\n\nBreakdown:\n\n29,700 \u00d7 300 =29,700 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 100.\n\n29,700 \u00d73:\n\n29,700 \u00d72 =59,400,\n\n29,700 \u00d71=29,700,\n\nTotal:59,400 +29,700=89,100.\n\nThus, 89,100 \u00d7100=8,910,000.\n\nCorrect.\n\nE +3abc=6,000,000+2,916,000=8,916,000.\n\nBut 8,910,000 vs 8,916,000. The difference is exactly 6,000. So where does this come from?\n\nWait, unless there's a mistake in the problem's expression? Or perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is in the triple (120,90,90). Let me check if it's a valid solution.\n\nWait, according to the problem's equation, E must be 6,000,000. According to direct computation, it is. According to the formula, it's not. This is a paradox.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have miscalculated abc:\n\nabc =120\u00d790\u00d790.\n\n120\u00d790=10,800,\n\n10,800\u00d790=972,000. Correct.\n\n3abc=2,916,000.\n\nSo, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) =8,910,000,\n\nE +3abc=8,910,000 \u21d2 E=8,910,000-3abc=8,910,000 -2,916,000=5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation says E=6,000,000. This is a contradiction.\n\nThe only way this can be resolved is if the formula is incorrect, but that's impossible as it's derived from expansion.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem's expression is different? Let me check again:\n\nThe problem says:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nYes, which is exactly E. So I think there must be an error in the problem's arithmetic, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I have a miscalculation in the expansion. Let me try expanding with a=120, b=90, c=90:\n\nCompute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) =300\u00d729,700=8,910,000.\n\nE = a\u00b2b +a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a +b\u00b2c +c\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =6,000,000.\n\nThen 3abc=3\u00d7120\u00d790\u00d790=2,916,000.\n\nThus, E +3abc=6,000,000+2,916,000=8,916,000.\n\nBut (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=8,910,000.\n\nThis is a discrepancy of 6,000. Thus, the formula must be wrong, but I can't see how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is in the triple (120,90,90). Let me check with another method:\n\nLet me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n=300*(29,700)=8,910,000.\n\nE =6,000,000.\n\nThus, 3abc=E + (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - E = ?\n\nWait, no.\n\nWait, the formula says (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = E + 3abc,\n\nSo 3abc = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - E.\n\nThus, in this case, 3abc =8,910,000 -6,000,000=2,910,000.\n\nBut 3abc=2,916,000.\n\nThus, discrepancy of6,000.\n\nThis suggests that either the formula is incorrect, or the direct computation is wrong.\n\nBut the formula is derived from expanding the product, so it must be correct. Therefore, the direct computation must have an error.\n\nWait, maybe I have miscalculated E's terms:\n\nLet me compute each term again:\n\na\u00b2b =120\u00b2\u00d790=14,400\u00d790=1,296,000\n\na\u00b2c = same as a\u00b2b=1,296,000\n\nb\u00b2a=90\u00b2\u00d7120=8,100\u00d7120=972,000\n\nb\u00b2c=90\u00b2\u00d790=729,000\n\nc\u00b2a=90\u00b2\u00d7120=972,000\n\nc\u00b2b=90\u00b2\u00d790=729,000\n\nAdding them:\n\n1,296,000 +1,296,000 =2,592,000\n\n+972,000 =3,564,000\n\n+729,000 =4,293,000\n\n+972,000 =5,265,000\n\n+729,000 =6,000,000.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula must be wrong, which is impossible. This is very confusing. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem's parameters? Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triple (120,90,90) is not a solution, but the direct computation is correct. Which would mean the problem has no solution with that triple. But that contradicts the problem's equation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I have a miscalculation in the formula:\n\nWait, let me try another triple that's not in AP but might work. Let me try (130, 100, 70). Which is an AP with d=30. Let's see.\n\nCompute using formula:\n\nab + bc + ca =130\u00d7100 +100\u00d770 +70\u00d7130 =13,000 +7,000 +9,100 =29,100.\n\n3abc =3\u00d7130\u00d7100\u00d770 =3\u00d7910,000=2,730,000.\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=300\u00d729,100=8,730,000.\n\nThus, E=8,730,000-2,730,000=6,000,000. Correct. So this works.\n\nNow, let me compute E directly:\n\na=130, b=100, c=70.\n\na\u00b2b =130\u00b2\u00d7100=16,900\u00d7100=1,690,000\n\na\u00b2c =130\u00b2\u00d770=16,900\u00d770=1,183,000\n\nb\u00b2a =100\u00b2\u00d7130=10,000\u00d7130=1,300,000\n\nb\u00b2c =100\u00b2\u00d770=10,000\u00d770=700,000\n\nc\u00b2a =70\u00b2\u00d7130=4,900\u00d7130=637,000\n\nc\u00b2b =70\u00b2\u00d7100=4,900\u00d7100=490,000\n\nTotal:\n\n1,690,000 +1,183,000=2,873,000\n\n+1,300,000=4,173,000\n\n+700,000=4,873,000\n\n+637,000=5,510,000\n\n+490,000=6,000,000. Correct.\n\nThus, formula holds here.\n\nNow, going back to the triple (120,90,90), why is there a discrepancy?\n\nWait, let me compute 3abc:\n\n3\u00d7120\u00d790\u00d790=3\u00d7120\u00d78100=3\u00d7972,000=2,916,000.\n\nThen, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)=300\u00d729,700=8,910,000.\n\nThus, E=8,910,000-2,916,000=5,994,000.\n\nBut direct computation gives6,000,000.\n\nTherefore, the only possible conclusion is that there's an error in direct computation.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in adding the terms:\n\nLet me re-add:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c =1,296,000 +1,296,000=2,592,000.\n\nb\u00b2a + b\u00b2c =972,000+729,000=1,701,000.\n\nc\u00b2a +c\u00b2b =972,000+729,000=1,701,000.\n\nTotal:\n\n2,592,000 +1,701,000 =4,293,000.\n\n4,293,000 +1,701,000 =5,994,000.\n\nAh! There's the mistake! I think I added incorrectly earlier.\n\nWait, 2,592,000 +1,701,000 is 4,293,000.\n\nThen adding the last 1,701,000 gives 4,293,000 +1,701,000 =6,000,000? Wait, no. 4,293,000 +1,701,000 is 6,000,000.\n\nWait, but 4,293,000 +1,701,000:\n\n4,293,000 +1,701,000:\n\n4,293,000 +1,700,000 =5,993,000,\n\nplus 1,000 gives 5,994,000.\n\nAh! Here's the mistake. I must have added incorrectly before.\n\nYes, so the correct total is5,994,000.\n\nTherefore, my earlier direct computation was wrong. I must have added incorrectly when I thought I got6,000,000. The correct total is5,994,000, which matches the formula.\n\nTherefore, the triple (120,90,90) does not satisfy the equation. So my initial mistake was in adding the terms incorrectly during the direct computation. Phew!\n\nTherefore, all solutions are indeed the arithmetic progression triples. Thus, the total number of triples is 1 (for d=0) + 6*100 =601.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with another non-AP triple that it doesn't work.\n\nTake (90, 100, 110), which is an AP with d=10.\n\nCompute using formula:\n\nab + bc + ca=90\u00d7100 +100\u00d7110 +110\u00d790 =9,000+11,000+9,900=29,900.\n\n3abc=3\u00d790\u00d7100\u00d7110=3\u00d7990,000=2,970,000.\n\n(a + b +c)(ab + bc + ca)=300\u00d729,900=8,970,000.\n\nThus, E=8,970,000-2,970,000=6,000,000. Correct.\n\nAnother non-AP triple: (100, 100, 100). Works.\n\nSo all solutions are indeed the arithmetic progression triples.\n\nTherefore, the total number of ordered triples is:\n\nFor d from 0 to 100:\n\n- d=0: (100,100,100) \u2192 1 triple.\n\n- d from 1 to 100: each d gives an unordered triple {100-d, 100, 100+d}, which can be permuted in 6 ways since all elements are distinct (unless d=0, but we already considered d=0). Wait, when d=50, the triple is (50,100,150), which has all distinct elements. Similarly for other d's except when d=0.\n\nThus, each d from 1 to 100 gives 6 ordered triples.\n\nThus total triples: 1 + 100\u00d76 = 601.\n\nHowever, we must ensure that when d=100, the triple is (0,100,200), which includes a zero, and permutations are allowed, which we have already considered.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601.\n\nWait, but let me think again: when d=100, the triple is (0,100,200). The permutations are 6, but one of them is (0,100,200), which is allowed. So all are valid.\n\nTherefore, total number of triples is indeed 601.\n\nBut earlier when I considered the case where one variable is zero, I found 6 solutions (permutations of (200,100,0)), which is included in d=100's count (6 triples). The all-100 case is also counted. So total is indeed 601.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601. So I should put \\boxed{601}.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the earlier example of (150, 100, 50):\n\nThis is part of d=50, so 6 permutations. Similarly for others.\n\nYes, so I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n\n\nTo find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfying \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and \\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\\), we start by analyzing the given equations.\n\nFirst, we recognize that the expression \\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b\\) can be rewritten using the identity:\n\\[\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b\n\\]\nGiven \\(a + b + c = 300\\), substituting this into the identity gives:\n\\[\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\\]\nDividing by 3, we get:\n\\[\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\\]\n\nNext, we consider the possibility of the triples forming an arithmetic progression (AP). For an AP centered at 100, the terms can be written as \\(100 - d\\), \\(100\\), and \\(100 + d\\) where \\(d\\) is a nonnegative integer. This ensures the sum \\(a + b + c = 300\\).\n\nFor each \\(d\\) from 0 to 100:\n- When \\(d = 0\\), the triple is \\((100, 100, 100)\\), contributing 1 solution.\n- For each \\(d\\) from 1 to 100, the terms \\(100 - d\\), \\(100\\), and \\(100 + d\\) are distinct, leading to \\(6\\) permutations each.\n\nThus, the total number of solutions is:\n- 1 solution for \\(d = 0\\)\n- \\(100 \\times 6 = 600\\) solutions for \\(d = 1\\) to \\(100\\)\n\nSumming these, we get:\n\\[\n1 + 600 = 601\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of triples \\((a, b, c)\\) is \\(\\boxed{601}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem. We have two equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n2. a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nWe need to find all triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers that satisfy both equations. Since the variables are symmetric, maybe there's some symmetry in the solution.\n\nLet me think about the second equation. The expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ... looks familiar. Maybe I can factor it somehow. Let me see:\n\nLet me try to factor the expression. Let's consider each term. For example, a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c can be factored as a\u00b2(b + c). Similarly, the other terms can be grouped:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nHmm, that's a good start. Since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), etc. Let's try that.\n\nSo substituting:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\nGrouping terms:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nYes, that's correct. Then since (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c, substituting gives:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c)\n\nSo the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nHmm. Let me see if there's another way to write this. Alternatively, maybe expanding the expression can lead to some simplification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider another approach. Let me recall that the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b can also be written as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Let me verify that:\n\nLet me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n= a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)\n\n= a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + abc + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + abc + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + a c\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, maybe better to compute term by term:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n= a\u00b2b + a b c + a c\u00b2 + a b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + b c a + c a\u00b2 + c b c + c\u00b2 a\n\nWait, but terms like a c\u00b2 and c a\u00b2 are same as a\u00b2c and c\u00b2a. Let me group similar terms:\n\n= a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b + 3abc\n\nTherefore, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 3abc\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc\n\nTherefore, the given equation can be written as:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nSince we know a + b + c = 300, substitute that in:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, so that gives:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nLet me divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nHmm, okay. So now, we have two equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n\n2. 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nSo now, perhaps we can let variables be a, b, c, and try to find their relations. Maybe set variables in terms of symmetric functions?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider substituting variables. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca. Then our second equation is 100 Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n100 Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nAlso, we know that for three variables,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo, 300^2 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2 Q\n\nTherefore, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 90000 - 2Q\n\nBut not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of variables as symmetric, so maybe two variables are equal?\n\nSuppose that two variables are equal, say a = b. Then, since the equations are symmetric, perhaps this can lead us to a solution.\n\nLet me assume that a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300 => c = 300 - 2a.\n\nThen, substitute into the second equation:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nSince a = b and c = 300 - 2a,\n\nab = a^2,\n\nbc = a*(300 - 2a),\n\nca = a*(300 - 2a),\n\nTherefore, ab + bc + ca = a^2 + 2a(300 - 2a) = a^2 + 600a - 4a^2 = -3a^2 + 600a\n\nThen, abc = a * a * (300 - 2a) = a\u00b2(300 - 2a)\n\nSo plug into the equation:\n\n100*(-3a\u00b2 + 600a) - a\u00b2(300 - 2a) = 2,000,000\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 100*(-3a\u00b2 + 600a) = -300a\u00b2 + 60,000a\n\nSecond term: -a\u00b2(300 - 2a) = -300a\u00b2 + 2a\u00b3\n\nTherefore, combining:\n\n-300a\u00b2 + 60,000a - 300a\u00b2 + 2a\u00b3 = 2,000,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2a\u00b3 - 600a\u00b2 + 60,000a - 2,000,000 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, so we have a cubic equation in a. Let me see if this can be factored or solved.\n\nLet me try to see if a = 100 is a root. Plugging in a = 100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nYes, so a = 100 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (a - 100) out.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100):\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nDivided by (a - 100). Let's use synthetic division with root 100:\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200\n\nMultiply -200 by 100 = -20,000. Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100 = 1,000,000. Add to last term: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 0\n\nSo the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000). Let me check the quadratic:\n\na\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000. Let's see if this factors further.\n\nDiscriminant D = (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So it's a perfect square.\n\nThus, a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = (a - 100)^2\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0\n\nWait, so the cubic equation is (a - 100)^3 = 0, so the only real root is a = 100 with multiplicity 3.\n\nTherefore, in this case, when a = b, the solution is a = b = 100, then c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100. So the triple is (100,100,100). But that would mean all three variables are equal. Let me check if that satisfies the original equation.\n\nCheck for a = b = c = 100:\n\nCompute the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nEach term is 100\u00b2*100 = 1,000,000. Since there are 6 terms, total is 6,000,000. Which matches. So that works.\n\nTherefore, when assuming two variables equal, we get the solution (100,100,100). But are there other solutions where variables are not equal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other solutions where two variables are equal but different from 100? Wait, but in this case, the cubic only had a = 100 as a root. So maybe when we set a = b, the only solution is when all three are equal. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where all three variables are different. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe suppose that one of the variables is zero. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose c = 0. Then the equations become a + b = 300 and the second equation becomes a\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2a + 0\u00b2b = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab * 300.\n\nSet that equal to 6,000,000. So ab * 300 = 6,000,000 => ab = 20,000.\n\nSo, with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. Let's see if this is possible.\n\nSo, solving for a and b. Let me denote variables:\n\nLet a and b be nonnegative integers with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.\n\nThe quadratic equation would be x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0.\n\nLet me compute discriminant D = 300\u00b2 - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.\n\nSo sqrt(D) = 100. Therefore, roots are [300 \u00b1 100]/2 = (400)/2 = 200 and (200)/2 = 100. Wait, 300 - 100 is 200, so 200/2 = 100. Wait, so roots are 200 and 100.\n\nThus, solutions are (a, b) = (200, 100) or (100, 200). So with c=0, we have triples (200,100,0), (100,200,0), and similarly if we set a=0 or b=0, we would get other permutations.\n\nWait, but hold on, since c is set to 0, so (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (0,100,200). So total of 6 solutions here. Wait, but let me check:\n\nWait, actually, if c=0, then the variables are (a, b, 0) where a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. So the solutions for (a,b) are (200,100) and (100,200). So the triples would be (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (0, 200, 100), (100, 0, 200), (0, 100, 200). That's 6 ordered triples. Since the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers\", so order matters here? Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says \"the number of triples (a,b,c)\", so I think the order matters, so these are distinct.\n\nBut let me confirm if these actually satisfy the second equation. Let me take (200,100,0):\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\n= (200\u00b2)(100) + (200\u00b2)(0) + (100\u00b2)(200) + (100\u00b2)(0) + (0\u00b2)(200) + (0\u00b2)(100)\n\n= (40,000)(100) + 0 + (10,000)(200) + 0 + 0 + 0\n\n= 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000. Yes, that works.\n\nSimilarly, all those permutations would work. So these 6 triples are valid.\n\nSo that's 6 solutions. Then, the triple where all are 100 is another solution. So that's 1 more, so total so far 7. But are there more?\n\nWait, perhaps there are other cases where two variables are equal but not 100? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when one variable is different from the other two but not zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when two variables are equal but not 100, but the cubic equation didn't show that. Wait, when I assumed a = b, the only solution was a = b = c = 100. So perhaps that's the only case where two variables are equal?\n\nAlternatively, suppose that two variables are equal but not 100, but that would require a different approach. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where all three variables are different. Let me see if there are any.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of variables x, y, z where x = a, y = b, z = c. Since the equations are symmetric, perhaps we can consider cases based on the number of variables equal.\n\nCase 1: All three variables equal. Then a = b = c = 100, which works as we saw.\n\nCase 2: Two variables equal, third different. Let's suppose a = b \u2260 c. Then as we saw, the only solution here is when all three are equal, so maybe there are no solutions where two are equal and the third is different?\n\nWait, when we set a = b, the only solution was a = b = c = 100. So perhaps if two variables are equal but different from 100, there is no solution. So maybe the only solution in this case is the all-100 case.\n\nCase 3: All variables different. So, we need to find triples where a, b, c are all different and non-zero. Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps other solutions where one variable is zero. Wait, we already considered the case where one variable is zero, leading to 6 solutions. So perhaps those are the only ones?\n\nWait, but let me check another case where two variables are zero. Suppose two variables are zero, say b = c =0, then a = 300. Then the second equation becomes a\u00b2b + ... but all terms would be zero, since b and c are zero, so the sum is zero, which is not equal to 6,000,000. So that's invalid. So triples with two zeros don't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe triples where one variable is non-zero and others are zero? That's already covered when two variables are zero, which gives zero, so no.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are either the all-100 triple or the triples with two numbers (200,100,0) and permutations. So total solutions would be 1 + 6 = 7? But wait, let me check if there are other possibilities where none of the variables are equal and none are zero.\n\nWait, perhaps there are triples where all three variables are different and non-zero. Let me see.\n\nSuppose a, b, c are all different and non-zero. Let me see if such triples can satisfy the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me denote that equation again:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nabc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, perhaps trying to find integer solutions here with a + b + c = 300.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of variables as symmetric and set up equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables x = a, y = b, z = c, with x + y + z = 300, and the other equation as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let variables be in terms of deviations from 100. Since when all are equal, they are 100, so maybe set a = 100 + p, b = 100 + q, c = 100 + r. Then p + q + r = 0. Let's see:\n\nLet me try this substitution. Let a = 100 + p, b = 100 + q, c = 100 + r. Then:\n\na + b + c = 300 => (100 + p) + (100 + q) + (100 + r) = 300 => 300 + (p + q + r) = 300 => p + q + r = 0.\n\nNow, substitute into the second equation:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst, ab + bc + ca:\n\nab = (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + p) + pq\n\nSimilarly for bc and ca. So:\n\nab + bc + ca = [100\u00b2 + 100(p + q) + pq] + [100\u00b2 + 100(q + r) + qr] + [100\u00b2 + 100(r + p) + rp]\n\n= 3*100\u00b2 + 100[ (p + q) + (q + r) + (r + p) ] + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nSimplify:\n\n3*10,000 + 100[2(p + q + r)] + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nBut since p + q + r = 0, the middle term becomes 100*2*0 = 0. So:\n\nab + bc + ca = 30,000 + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nSimilarly, compute abc:\n\nabc = (100 + p)(100 + q)(100 + r)\n\nExpanding this:\n\nFirst multiply (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + p) + pq\n\nThen multiply by (100 + r):\n\n= [100\u00b2 + 100(p + q) + pq]*(100 + r)\n\n= 100\u00b2*(100) + 100\u00b2*r + 100(p + q)*100 + 100(p + q)*r + pq*100 + pq*r\n\nHmm, this might get complicated, but let me see:\n\nAlternatively, expand step by step:\n\n= 100*(100 + q)(100 + r) + p*(100 + q)(100 + r)\n\nFirst term: 100*(100\u00b2 + 100(r + q) + qr)\n\nSecond term: p*(100\u00b2 + 100(r + q) + qr)\n\nSo altogether:\n\n= 100*100\u00b2 + 100*100(r + q) + 100*qr + p*100\u00b2 + p*100(r + q) + p*qr\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= 100\u00b3 + 100\u00b2(r + q) + 100 qr + 100\u00b2 p + 100 p (r + q) + p qr\n\nBut since p + q + r = 0 => r + q = -p. Substitute:\n\n= 100\u00b3 + 100\u00b2*(-p) + 100 qr + 100\u00b2 p + 100 p*(-p) + p qr\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 100\u00b3\n\nSecond term: -100\u00b2 p\n\nThird term: +100 qr\n\nFourth term: +100\u00b2 p\n\nFifth term: -100 p\u00b2\n\nSixth term: + p qr\n\nSo combine like terms:\n\n-100\u00b2 p + 100\u00b2 p cancels out.\n\nLeaving:\n\n100\u00b3 + 100 qr -100 p\u00b2 + p qr - 100 p\u00b2? Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait fifth term is -100 p\u00b2, sixth term is p qr. So altogether:\n\n100\u00b3 + 100 qr -100 p\u00b2 + p qr\n\nWait, also, the third term was +100 qr and sixth term + p qr, so total for qr terms: 100 qr + p qr = qr(100 + p)\n\nBut p + q + r =0 => p = - (q + r). So substituting p:\n\nqr(100 - (q + r))\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me see if there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since p + q + r = 0, we can write r = -p - q. Then substitute into the equations.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSet r = -p - q.\n\nThen, ab + bc + ca = 30,000 + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nCompute pq + qr + rp:\n\n= pq + q*(-p - q) + p*(-p - q)\n\n= pq - pq - q\u00b2 - p\u00b2 - pq\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nqr = q*(-p - q) = -pq - q\u00b2\n\nrp = p*(-p - q) = -p\u00b2 - pq\n\nSo pq + qr + rp = pq + (-pq - q\u00b2) + (-p\u00b2 - pq) = pq - pq - q\u00b2 - p\u00b2 - pq = -p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 - pq\n\nTherefore, ab + bc + ca = 30,000 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq)\n\nSimilarly, compute abc:\n\nabc = (100 + p)(100 + q)(100 + r) = (100 + p)(100 + q)(100 - p - q)\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nLet me first compute (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + p) + pq as before.\n\nThen multiply by (100 - p - q):\n\nLet me denote A = 100 + p + q, but maybe it's better to just proceed step by step.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote term1 = (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(p + q) + pq\n\nMultiply term1 by (100 - (p + q)):\n\n= [100\u00b2 + 100(p + q) + pq] * [100 - (p + q)]\n\nLet me set s = p + q for simplicity. Then:\n\n= [100\u00b2 + 100 s + pq] * [100 - s]\n\nExpand this:\n\n= 100\u00b2*(100 - s) + 100 s (100 - s) + pq (100 - s)\n\n= 100\u00b3 - 100\u00b2 s + 100 s * 100 - 100 s\u00b2 + 100 pq - pq s\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 100\u00b3\n\nSecond term: -100\u00b2 s\n\nThird term: +10,000 s\n\nFourth term: -100 s\u00b2\n\nFifth term: +100 pq\n\nSixth term: -pq s\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nTerms with s\u00b2: -100 s\u00b2\n\nTerms with s: (-100\u00b2 s + 10,000 s - pq s) = s(-100\u00b2 + 10,000 - pq )\n\nBut 100\u00b2 is 10,000, so -10,000 s + 10,000 s cancels out. So that term is -pq s.\n\nThen constants: 100\u00b3 + 100 pq\n\nThus, overall:\n\nabc = 100\u00b3 + 100 pq - 100 s\u00b2 - pq s\n\nBut s = p + q, so s\u00b2 = (p + q)^2 = p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\nabc = 100\u00b3 + 100 pq - 100(p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2) - pq(p + q)\n\n= 100\u00b3 + 100 pq - 100 p\u00b2 - 200 pq - 100 q\u00b2 - p\u00b2 q - p q\u00b2\n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe this substitution isn't helpful. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall the equation we need:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of p and q:\n\nab + bc + ca = 30,000 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq)\n\nabc = ?\n\nAlternatively, let me substitute into the equation:\n\n100*(30,000 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq)) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nThus,\n\n3,000,000 - 100(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nTherefore,\n\n-100(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq) - abc = -1,000,000\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n100(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq) + abc = 1,000,000\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me see if I can express abc in terms of p and q. Alternatively, maybe this is too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying specific values. Since we already have two cases: all equal and one zero, giving 7 solutions. Maybe that's all?\n\nWait, but let me check another case. Suppose that two variables are 150 and the third is 0. Wait, then a + b + c = 150 + 150 + 0 = 300. Let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ... Let me compute for (150,150,0):\n\n= 150\u00b2*150 + 150\u00b2*0 + 150\u00b2*150 + 150\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2*150 + 0\u00b2*150\n\n= 2*(150^3) + 0 + 0 + 0\n\n= 2*(3,375,000) = 6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, (200, 100, 0) gives exactly 6,000,000 as we saw.\n\nHow about (150, 100, 50):\n\nCheck sum: 150 + 100 +50 = 300.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 150\u00b2*100 + 150\u00b2*50 + 100\u00b2*150 + 100\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*150 + 50\u00b2*100\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n150\u00b2*100 = 22,500 *100 = 2,250,000\n\n150\u00b2*50 = 22,500*50 = 1,125,000\n\n100\u00b2*150 = 10,000*150 = 1,500,000\n\n100\u00b2*50 = 10,000*50 = 500,000\n\n50\u00b2*150 = 2,500*150 = 375,000\n\n50\u00b2*100 = 2,500*100 = 250,000\n\nTotal sum:\n\n2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 = 4,875,000\n\n+500,000 = 5,375,000\n\n+375,000 = 5,750,000\n\n+250,000 = 6,000,000. Wait, that's exactly 6,000,000! So (150,100,50) is another solution!\n\nWait, so that's a new solution where all three variables are different and non-zero. Hmm, so my previous assumption that only the all-equal case and the cases with a zero were the only solutions was wrong. So there must be more solutions.\n\nSo this complicates things. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nWait, let me recalculate (150, 100,50):\n\na=150, b=100, c=50:\n\na\u00b2b = 150\u00b2 *100 = 22500 *100 = 2,250,000\n\na\u00b2c = 22500 *50 = 1,125,000\n\nb\u00b2a = 100\u00b2 *150 = 10,000 *150 = 1,500,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 10,000 *50 = 500,000\n\nc\u00b2a = 2500 *150 = 375,000\n\nc\u00b2b = 2500 *100 = 250,000\n\nAdding all up:\n\n2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 = 4,875,000\n\n+500,000 = 5,375,000\n\n+375,000 = 5,750,000\n\n+250,000 = 6,000,000. Yes, that's correct. So this is a valid solution. So this is a new solution where all three variables are different. So my previous approach missed this.\n\nTherefore, there are solutions with all variables different. Hmm, so I need a better approach.\n\nLet me think again. Let me see if I can find all solutions.\n\nWe have the equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n\n2. 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300,\n\nLet me denote P = abc,\n\nand Q = ab + bc + ca.\n\nThen the second equation is 100Q - P = 2,000,000 => P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nWe also know from algebra that for three variables:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c)\n\nWait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, the relation between S, Q, and the sum of squares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express in terms of variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of variables as a, b, c being roots of a cubic equation. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider that if a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0. So:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0\n\nBut since P = 100Q - 2,000,000,\n\nthen the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables as follows.\n\nLet me denote variables x = a, y = b, z = c.\n\nLet me see if there is a substitution or relation that can be exploited.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables in terms of two variables. Let me set a = 100 + d, b = 100 + e, so that c = 300 - a - b = 300 - (100 + d) - (100 + e) = 100 - d - e.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me compute ab + bc + ca and abc in terms of d and e.\n\nFirst, compute ab:\n\n(100 + d)(100 + e) = 100\u00b2 + 100(e + d) + de\n\nCompute bc:\n\n(100 + e)(100 - d - e) = (100 + e)(100 - (d + e)) = 100*(100) -100*(d + e) + e*100 - e*(d + e)\n\n= 10,000 -100d -100e + 100e - e d - e\u00b2\n\n= 10,000 -100d - e d - e\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, compute ca:\n\n(100 + d)(100 - d - e) = (100 + d)(100 - (d + e)) = 100*(100) -100*(d + e) + d*100 - d*(d + e)\n\n= 10,000 -100d -100e + 100d - d\u00b2 -d e\n\n= 10,000 -100e - d\u00b2 - d e\n\nNow, ab + bc + ca:\n\nab = 10,000 + 100(d + e) + de\n\nbc = 10,000 -100d - e d - e\u00b2\n\nca = 10,000 -100e - d\u00b2 - d e\n\nAdding all together:\n\nab + bc + ca = [10,000 + 100(d + e) + de] + [10,000 -100d - e d - e\u00b2] + [10,000 -100e - d\u00b2 - d e]\n\nCombine term by term:\n\nConstant terms: 10,000 +10,000 +10,000 = 30,000\n\nTerms with d:\n\n100d (from ab) -100d (from bc) -100e (from ca's -100e term? Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, in ab's terms: the 100(d + e) gives 100d + 100e.\n\nIn bc: -100d - e d (the -100d and -d e terms)\n\nIn ca: -100e (from the -100e term) -d\u00b2 -d e.\n\nWait, let me list all the terms:\n\nFrom ab:\n\n+100d + 100e + de\n\nFrom bc:\n\n-100d - d e - e\u00b2\n\nFrom ca:\n\n-100e - d\u00b2 - d e\n\nNow, combining like terms:\n\nTerms with 100d: +100d (from ab) -100d (from bc) = 0\n\nTerms with 100e: +100e (from ab) -100e (from ca) = 0\n\nTerms with de:\n\nFrom ab: +de\n\nFrom bc: -d e\n\nFrom ca: -d e\n\nTotal: de - d e - d e = -d e\n\nTerms with d\u00b2:\n\nFrom ca: -d\u00b2\n\nTerms with e\u00b2:\n\nFrom bc: -e\u00b2\n\nSo overall:\n\nab + bc + ca = 30,000 - d e - d\u00b2 - e\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, compute abc:\n\na = 100 + d, b = 100 + e, c = 100 - d - e\n\nSo:\n\nabc = (100 + d)(100 + e)(100 - d - e)\n\nLet me expand this step by step.\n\nFirst compute (100 + d)(100 + e):\n\n= 100*100 + 100e + 100d + d e = 10,000 + 100(e + d) + d e\n\nMultiply this by (100 - d - e):\n\nLet me denote term1 = (100 + d)(100 + e) = 10,000 + 100(d + e) + d e\n\nMultiply term1 by (100 - (d + e)):\n\nLet me set f = d + e for simplicity.\n\nThen term1 = 10,000 + 100 f + d e\n\nMultiply by (100 - f):\n\n= (10,000)(100 - f) + 100 f (100 - f) + d e (100 - f)\n\n= 1,000,000 - 10,000 f + 10,000 f - 100 f\u00b2 + 100 d e - d e f\n\nSimplify:\n\n1,000,000 + (-10,000 f +10,000 f) cancels.\n\nThen, -100 f\u00b2 + 100 d e - d e f\n\nSo:\n\nabc = 1,000,000 - 100 f\u00b2 + 100 d e - d e f\n\nBut f = d + e, so substituting:\n\nabc = 1,000,000 - 100 (d + e)^2 + 100 d e - d e (d + e)\n\nExpand (d + e)^2:\n\n= d\u00b2 + 2 d e + e\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\nabc = 1,000,000 - 100(d\u00b2 + 2 d e + e\u00b2) + 100 d e - d e (d + e)\n\n= 1,000,000 -100 d\u00b2 -200 d e -100 e\u00b2 + 100 d e - d\u00b2 e - d e\u00b2\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n-100 d\u00b2 -100 e\u00b2 - d\u00b2 e - d e\u00b2\n\n-200 d e + 100 d e = -100 d e\n\nSo,\n\nabc = 1,000,000 -100 d\u00b2 -100 e\u00b2 -100 d e - d\u00b2 e - d e\u00b2\n\nHmm, complicated.\n\nNow, plug into the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nWe have ab + bc + ca = 30,000 - d e - d\u00b2 - e\u00b2\n\nTherefore, 100(ab + bc + ca) = 3,000,000 - 100(d e + d\u00b2 + e\u00b2)\n\nThen, subtract abc:\n\n3,000,000 -100(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + d e) - [1,000,000 -100 d\u00b2 -100 e\u00b2 -100 d e - d\u00b2 e - d e\u00b2] = 2,000,000\n\nSimplify the left side:\n\n3,000,000 -100(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + d e) -1,000,000 +100 d\u00b2 +100 e\u00b2 +100 d e + d\u00b2 e + d e\u00b2\n\nCombine terms:\n\n3,000,000 -1,000,000 = 2,000,000\n\n-100(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + d e) +100 d\u00b2 +100 e\u00b2 +100 d e = 0 (they cancel out)\n\nRemaining terms: d\u00b2 e + d e\u00b2\n\nThus:\n\n2,000,000 + d\u00b2 e + d e\u00b2 = 2,000,000\n\nTherefore, d\u00b2 e + d e\u00b2 = 0\n\nFactor out d e:\n\nd e (d + e) = 0\n\nSo, the equation reduces to d e (d + e) = 0.\n\nTherefore, either d = 0, e = 0, or d + e = 0.\n\nCase 1: d = 0.\n\nIf d = 0, then since a = 100 + d = 100, and b = 100 + e, c = 100 - 0 - e = 100 - e.\n\nThus, variables are (100, 100 + e, 100 - e).\n\nThen, since a, b, c must be nonnegative, we have:\n\n100 + e \u2265 0 \u2192 e \u2265 -100,\n\n100 - e \u2265 0 \u2192 e \u2264 100,\n\nand since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, e can range from -100 to 100, but also, since b = 100 + e must be nonnegative, e \u2265 -100, and c = 100 - e \u2265 0 \u21d2 e \u2264 100. So e \u2208 {-100, ..., 100}. But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, e must be integer between -100 and 100. But also, since variables are nonnegative, b = 100 + e \u2265 0 \u21d2 e \u2265 -100, and c = 100 - e \u2265 0 \u21d2 e \u2264 100. So e can be any integer from -100 to 100, but also, since a, b, c must be nonnegative, but a is fixed at 100, so e can be from -100 to 100, but also, b and c must be nonnegative. However, since e can be negative, let's see:\n\nWait, but if e is negative, say e = -k where k is positive, then b = 100 - k and c = 100 + k. Since b must be nonnegative, 100 - k \u22650 \u21d2 k \u2264100, so e \u2265 -100.\n\nThus, e can range from -100 to 100, but in integers. However, note that variables must be nonnegative integers. So e can be any integer from -100 to 100, but with the constraints above.\n\nHowever, we also need to ensure that in the original problem, the triple (a, b, c) must satisfy the second equation. However, in this case, since we derived that d e (d + e)=0, so with d =0, it's valid.\n\nBut let me see what triples this gives. Since d=0, a=100, b=100+e, c=100 - e.\n\nSo the triple is (100, 100 + e, 100 - e). Since e can be any integer from -100 to 100, but such that b and c are nonnegative. So e \u2208 {-100, ..., 100} but with constraints.\n\nWait, but let me check if this is valid. Let me pick e = 50, then the triple is (100, 150, 50). Which is exactly the solution we found earlier (150, 100,50) but reordered. Since variables are ordered, so this would be a different ordered triple, but since the problem counts ordered triples, that's okay.\n\nWait, but actually, in this case, when d=0, e can range from -100 to 100. However, for each e, we get a unique triple (100, 100 + e, 100 - e). However, we have to ensure that all variables are nonnegative.\n\nIndeed, when e = 100, then b = 200, c=0. So that gives (100,200,0), which is one of the earlier solutions.\n\nWhen e = -100, then b=0, c=200, giving (100,0,200). Also valid.\n\nSimilarly, e=50 gives (100,150,50), and e=0 gives (100,100,100). So all these are valid.\n\nSo in this case, d=0 gives us all triples where a=100 and b and c differ by e. So the number of solutions here would be the number of integers e from -100 to 100, but with b and c nonnegative. Since e can be from -100 to 100, that's 201 values (since inclusive). However, when e =100, c becomes 0, which is allowed. Similarly, e =-100 gives b=0. So total 201 solutions here. However, but wait, in this case, a is fixed at 100, so each e gives a unique triple. However, in this case, we have to consider that the variables are ordered triples. However, in our substitution, we fixed a =100, so this counts all triples where a=100 and b and c vary as above. However, the problem counts all ordered triples, so triples where a isn't necessarily 100 but could be in any position. Wait, but in this case, we set a=100 + d, so d=0 means a=100. So this case only counts triples where a is exactly 100. The other cases where d or e are non-zero would have to be considered as well, but let's proceed.\n\nCase 2: e =0.\n\nSimilarly, if e =0, then by symmetry, the triple would be (100 + d, 100, 100 - d). This is symmetric to case1, so this would give another set of triples where b=100, and a and c vary similarly. So similarly, this would give another 201 triples. However, note that when d=0 here, it corresponds to the triple (100,100,100), which is already counted in case1. So there is overlap here. So we have to be careful not to double count.\n\nCase3: d + e =0.\n\nHere, d + e =0 \u21d2 e = -d.\n\nSo substituting e = -d, then c =100 - d - e = 100 - d - (-d)=100.\n\nSo c=100. Then, variables are (100 + d, 100 - d, 100). So similar to the previous cases but with c fixed at 100. This would also give triples where c=100, and a and b vary such that a =100 +d, b=100 -d. So again, this gives another 201 triples with c=100. Again overlapping when d=0.\n\nTherefore, the total solutions from all three cases would be 3*201 - 3 +1? Wait, need to think carefully.\n\nWait, actually, the three cases (d=0, e=0, d+e=0) each give 201 solutions, but overlapping when two or all three conditions are met.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- The triple (100,100,100) is counted in all three cases (when d=e=0, which also satisfies d + e=0).\n\n- Triples where two variables are 100 are counted in two cases. For example, (100, 200,0) is in case1 (d=0, e=100) and case3 (since d + e =0? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, in case3 where d + e =0, variables are (a, b, c) = (100 + d, 100 -d, 100). So to get (100, 200,0), set d=0, but then that would be (100,100,100). To get (100,200,0), need a=100, b=200, c=0. That would be in case1 where e=100 (since a=100, b=100 + e, so e=100 gives b=200 and c=0). So that is only in case1.\n\nWait, so actually, the overlaps between the cases are only at the all-100 triple. So:\n\nEach case (d=0, e=0, d+e=0) gives 201 solutions, but the all-100 triple is counted three times, and other overlaps occur when two variables are 100?\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nTake case1 (d=0):\n\ntriples are (100, 100+e, 100 -e). So if e=0, it's (100,100,100). If e=100, it's (100,200,0). If e=-100, it's (100,0,200). Similarly for other e.\n\nCase2 (e=0):\n\ntriples are (100 +d, 100, 100 -d). Similarly, d can be from -100 to 100. For d=0, same triple. For d=100, (200,100,0). For d=-100, (0,100,200).\n\nCase3 (d + e =0):\n\ntriples are (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). Here, d can range from -100 to 100. For d=0, same triple. For d=100, (200,0,100). For d=-100, (0,200,100).\n\nThus, the only overlapping triple among all three cases is (100,100,100). The other triples where two variables are 100 are counted in two cases. For example, (200,100,0) is in case1 (when e=100) and case2 (when d=100). Similarly, (100,200,0) is in case1 (e=100) and case3 (d=100? Wait, no, in case3, to get (100,200,0):\n\nWait, in case3, variables are (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get (100,200,0):\n\nWait, that would require 100 -d =200 \u21d2 d =-100, then the first variable would be 100 + (-100)=0, third is 100. So (0,200,100). Not (100,200,0). So (200,100,0) is in case2 (when d=100) and case1 (when e= -100? Wait no. Wait case1 is (100, 100+e, 100 -e). To get (200,100,0), need 100+e =200 \u21d2 e=100, then c=100 -100=0, so yes, that's in case1 (e=100). Also, in case2, when d=100, we get (200,100,0). So yes, (200,100,0) is in both case1 and case2. Similarly for other triples with two variables at 100.\n\nTherefore, to compute the total number of distinct triples from all three cases:\n\nEach of the three cases (d=0, e=0, d+e=0) has 201 triples. However, the overlaps are:\n\n- The triple (100,100,100) is counted three times (once in each case).\n\n- Each of the triples with two variables at 100 and one at 200 or 0 is counted twice (once in two cases).\n\n- The other triples (where only one variable is 100 and the others are different) are counted once (in exactly one case).\n\nTherefore, total triples from the three cases:\n\nTotal = (3 * 201) - (number of overlaps)\n\nFirst, subtract the overcounts:\n\nThe all-100 triple is counted three times, so we need to subtract 2 to leave it counted once.\n\nThen, for each of the triples with two variables at 100 and one at 200 or 0:\n\nThere are six such triples:\n\n(200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (0,100,200).\n\nEach of these is counted in two cases. So each is counted twice, so total overcount is 6*(2-1)=6. So need to subtract 6.\n\nTherefore total:\n\nTotal triples = 3*201 - 2 (for the all-100 triple) - 6 (for the six edge triples) = 603 - 2 -6 = 595?\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nWait actually, the formula for inclusion-exclusion here might be:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC\n\nWhere A, B, C are the three cases.\n\nWhere A is case1 (d=0), B case2 (e=0), C case3 (d+e=0).\n\nCompute:\n\nA = 201, B=201, C=201.\n\nAB: overlaps between A and B. These are triples that are in both A and B.\n\nTo be in both A and B: need both d=0 and e=0. So that's only the triple (100,100,100).\n\nSimilarly, AC: overlaps between A and C. To be in A (d=0) and C (d + e =0), then d=0 and e=0. So again only (100,100,100).\n\nSimilarly, BC: overlaps between B and C. To be in B (e=0) and C (d + e=0 \u21d2 d=0). So again only (100,100,100).\n\nABC: overlaps in all three, which is also (100,100,100).\n\nThus:\n\nTotal = 201 + 201 + 201 - (1 +1 +1) +1 = 603 - 3 +1 = 601.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous approach. Which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is better.\n\nTotal triples in A \u222a B \u222a C = A + B + C - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC\n\n= 201*3 - 3*1 +1 = 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nHmm, so that suggests 601 triples? But this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nAlternatively, if the three cases each have 201 triples, and their intersections (AB, AC, BC) each have 1 triple (the all-100 one), and the intersection of all three is also that one triple. So:\n\nTotal = 201+201+201 - (1 +1 +1) +1 = 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nHmm. So according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 601.\n\nBut let me think about the triples with two variables at 100 and the third at 200 or 0. For example, (200,100,0). This is in both case A and case B:\n\n- In case A (d=0): a=100, so to get (200,100,0), set e=100.\n\n- In case B (e=0): b=100, so set d=100, which gives a=200, c=0.\n\nTherefore, this triple is counted in both A and B, so in AB. Similarly, each of the six triples with two 100s and a 200 or 0 is counted in two cases, so each is in two of the intersections AB, AC, or BC. Wait, but actually, each of those triples is in exactly two of the cases.\n\nWait, for example, (200,100,0) is in A and B, so counted in AB. Similarly:\n\n(100,200,0) is in A and C? Wait:\n\nWait (100,200,0) is in case A (d=0, e=100) and case C (d + e =0? Let me see case C is d + e =0, so variables are (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get (100,200,0):\n\nWait, to have c=0, need 100 =0? No, c is always 100 in case C. So (100,200,0) is not in case C. Wait, so perhaps my earlier thought was wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nThe triples with two variables at 100 and one at 200 or 0 are:\n\n(200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (0,100,200).\n\nEach of these is in exactly two of the cases:\n\n- (200,100,0): in case A (d=0, e=100) and case B (e=0, d=100). So in AB.\n\n- (100,200,0): in case A (d=0, e=100? Wait, no, to get (100,200,0), in case A, e=100 gives b=200, c=0. Yes, so that's in case A. To get into case B (e=0), we need to have b=100, so that's not here. Wait, actually:\n\nWait (100,200,0) is in case A (as above), and is it in any other case?\n\nIn case C (d + e =0), variables are (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get (100,200,0), need third variable to be 0, but in case C, the third variable is 100. So no. So (100,200,0) is only in case A and case B?\n\nWait no:\n\nWait case B is e=0. So variables are (100 +d, 100, 100 -d). To get (100,200,0), set 100 -d =0 \u21d2 d=100, so first variable is 200, second is 100. So (200,100,0). So (200,100,0) is in case B. Whereas (100,200,0) is in case A but not in case B. Wait, so:\n\nWait (100,200,0) is in case A (d=0, e=100) gives (100, 100+100, 100-100) = (100,200,0). So case A includes this. To get this in case B, we need e=0, so variables are (100 +d, 100, 100 -d). To get the second variable to be 200, set 100=200? No, so it's not in case B. So actually, (100,200,0) is only in case A. Wait, then my previous thought was wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe each of the six edge triples is in only one case? Let me check:\n\nTake (200,100,0):\n\n- Case A: yes (d=0, e=100).\n\n- Case B: yes (e=0, d=100).\n\n- Case C: (d + e =0). To get (200,100,0), variables would have to be (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). The third variable must be 100, but here it is 0. So no.\n\nSo (200,100,0) is in both A and B.\n\n(100,200,0):\n\n- Case A: yes (e=100).\n\n- Case B: To be in case B (e=0), variables are (100 +d, 100, 100 -d). To have second variable 200, set 100=200? No. So no.\n\n- Case C: Not applicable.\n\nSo only in A.\n\nWait, so maybe only three of the edge triples are in two cases, and the others are only in one case?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nTake (200,0,100):\n\nThis is in case C (d + e=0):\n\nLet me see: variables are (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get third variable 100, so if first is 200, then d=100 \u21d2 second is 0, so (200,0,100). So yes, this is in case C. Also, is it in any other case?\n\nCase A: (100, 100 +e, 100 -e). To get (200,0,100), need first variable to be 200 \u21d2 d=100, but in case A, d=0. So no. Case B: e=0 \u21d2 variables (100 +d,100, 100 -d). To get (200,0,100), set second variable to 0 \u21d2 100=0? No. So only in case C.\n\nSimilarly, (0,200,100):\n\nVariables (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get first variable 0, d=-100 \u21d2 second variable 200, third 100. So yes, in case C. Also, in any other case?\n\nCase B: e=0. To get first variable 0 \u21d2 d=-100 \u21d2 (0, 100, 200). Not this one. So only in case C.\n\nSimilarly, (0,100,200):\n\nThis would be in case B (e=0):\n\nVariables (100 +d, 100, 100 -d). To get first variable 0 \u21d2 d=-100 \u21d2 third variable 200. So (0,100,200) is in case B. Also in any other case? Case C? Let's see:\n\nCase C requires d + e =0. Variables (100 +d, 100 -d,100). To get (0,100,200), third variable is 200, but case C third variable is always 100. So no. So only in case B.\n\nSimilarly, (100,0,200):\n\nIn case A (d=0): variables (100, 100 +e, 100 -e). To get third variable 200, set e= -100 \u21d2 (100, 0, 200). So yes, in case A. Also in case C? Let me see case C:\n\nVariables (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get third variable 200 \u21d2 100=200, no. So only case A.\n\nSo, of the six edge triples:\n\n- (200,100,0) is in both A and B\n\n- (200,0,100) is in C only\n\n- (100,200,0) is in A only\n\n- (0,200,100) is in C only\n\n- (0,100,200) is in B only\n\n- (100,0,200) is in A only\n\nThus, only one of the six edge triples is in two cases: (200,100,0) is in A and B.\n\nSimilarly, the triple (0,100,200) is in B only, so not overlapping with anything else except the all-100 triple.\n\nWait, so the only overlapping triples between the cases are:\n\n- The all-100 triple, counted in all three cases.\n\n- The triple (200,100,0) counted in both A and B.\n\nSimilarly, the triple (100,200,0) is only in A, (0,200,100) only in C, etc.\n\nTherefore, the overlaps between the cases are:\n\nAB: (200,100,0) and (100,100,100)\n\nAC: (100,0,200) and (100,100,100)\n\nBC: (0,100,200) and (100,100,100)\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nAB is the intersection of cases A and B. Which triples are in both A and B?\n\nA is triples where a=100, so first variable is 100.\n\nB is triples where b=100, so second variable is 100.\n\nThus, the intersection AB consists of triples where a=100 and b=100, so (100,100,c). Since a + b + c =300, c=100. So only (100,100,100).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought (200,100,0) was in both A and B. Wait, no:\n\nWait in case A: a=100. To have (200,100,0), a is 200, so it's not in case A. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, case A is when d=0, so a=100 +0 =100. So all triples in case A have a=100. So (200,100,0) has a=200, so it can't be in case A.\n\nWait, this is a critical mistake. Earlier when I considered case1 (d=0):\n\nVariables are (a, b, c) = (100, 100 +e, 100 -e). So a is always 100. So the triple (200,100,0) cannot be in case A, because a must be 100.\n\nWait, this is a big mistake. I must have confused variables earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nLet me re-express the substitution:\n\nWe set a = 100 + d,\n\nb = 100 + e,\n\nc = 300 - a - b = 300 - (100 + d) - (100 + e) = 100 - d - e.\n\nThus:\n\n- In case1 (d=0):\n\na =100,\n\nb =100 + e,\n\nc =100 - e.\n\nSo, a is always 100.\n\n- In case2 (e=0):\n\nb=100,\n\na=100 + d,\n\nc=100 - d.\n\nSo, b is always 100.\n\n- In case3 (d + e =0 \u21d2 e = -d):\n\nc =100,\n\na=100 + d,\n\nb=100 -d.\n\nThus, c is always 100.\n\nTherefore, the triples in each case have one variable fixed at 100:\n\n- case1: a=100\n\n- case2: b=100\n\n- case3: c=100\n\nTherefore, the triple (200,100,0) has a=200, b=100, c=0. This would be in case2 (since b=100 is fixed). So in case2, variables are (a, 100, c). To get (200,100,0), set a=200, c=0. Since a =100 + d \u21d2 d=100, so yes, it's in case2.\n\nSimilarly, the triple (100,200,0) has a=100, so it's in case1. To get b=200, set e=100 \u21d2 c=0. So (100,200,0) is in case1.\n\nSimilarly, (200,0,100) has c=100, so is in case3. To get a=200, set d=100 \u21d2 b=0.\n\nTherefore, the overlaps between the cases are:\n\n- The triple (100,100,100) is in all three cases.\n\n- Any triple with two variables at 100 and one at 200 or 0 is in exactly one case. For example:\n\n(100,100,100) is in all.\n\n(200,100,0) is in case2.\n\n(100,200,0) is in case1.\n\n(200,0,100) is in case3.\n\n(0,100,200) is in case2 (since b=100? No, b=100 is in case2. Wait (0,100,200):\n\na=0, b=100, c=200. This is in case2 (b=100). So yes.\n\n(0,200,100): a=0, b=200, c=100. This is in case3 (c=100).\n\n(100,0,200): a=100, b=0, c=200. In case1 (a=100).\n\nTherefore, none of the edge triples (with two variables at 100 and one at 200 or 0) are counted in more than one case except the all-100 triple.\n\nThus, the only overlap between any two cases is the all-100 triple. For example, the intersection of case1 and case2 is the triples where a=100 and b=100 \u21d2 c=100. So only (100,100,100).\n\nSimilarly for other intersections.\n\nTherefore, using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal triples = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nEach of |A|, |B|, |C| is 201.\n\nEach intersection |A\u2229B|, |A\u2229C|, |B\u2229C| is 1 (only the all-100 triple).\n\nThe intersection of all three is also 1.\n\nThus:\n\nTotal = 201*3 - 1*3 +1 = 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nTherefore, the three cases contribute 601 distinct triples.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider if there are solutions outside of these three cases.\n\nRecall that the condition from the equation was d e (d + e) =0, which requires that either d=0, e=0, or d + e=0. Thus, all solutions must fall into one of these three cases. Therefore, there are no solutions outside of these cases.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601.\n\nWait but wait, in our earlier example, the triple (150, 100,50) was valid. Let's see if that is counted in these cases.\n\nThe triple (150,100,50) has a=150, b=100, c=50. Since b=100, it's in case2 (where b=100). So in case2, variables are (a,100,c), with a =100 +d, c=100 -d. Here, a=150 \u21d2 d=50 \u21d2 c=100 -50=50. So yes, this is in case2. So it is counted.\n\nSimilarly, (150,50,100) would be in case3 (c=100). So all valid triples are indeed counted in these cases.\n\nTherefore, the total is 601.\n\nBut wait, let me check the count again.\n\nEach case (A,B,C) has 201 triples. Each case includes the all-100 triple and the edge triples where the fixed variable is 100 and the other two vary such that their sum is 200.\n\nFor case A (a=100), the triples are (100, b, c) where b + c =200, and b and c are nonnegative integers. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to b + c =200 is 201 (from b=0 to 200). So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly for case B and C.\n\nTherefore, each case has 201 triples. The overlaps between any two cases are only the all-100 triple. Thus, the inclusion-exclusion gives 601.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"nonnegative integers\", so including zero. So the count is correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the number of ordered triples. So for example, (100, 200,0) and (200,100,0) are different triples and are both counted separately. Since in case A and case B respectively.\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed 601.\n\nWait, but initially I thought there were 7 solutions, but clearly that was wrong because I missed the cases where variables are different but non-zero. So the correct answer must be 601?\n\nBut let me check the example with (150,100,50). This is one triple, and it's part of case2. Similarly, permutations like (100,50,150) would be in case1 (since a=100). Wait, no:\n\nWait (100,50,150):\n\nThis has a=100, so it's in case1. Here, b=50, so e = b -100 = -50. Then c =100 -e = 150. So yes, it's in case1.\n\nSimilarly, (50,100,150) is in case2 (b=100), and (50,150,100) is in case3 (c=100). Each of these permutations are counted in their respective cases.\n\nTherefore, all permutations where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 are counted, so all permutations are included.\n\nTherefore, the total number is indeed 601. But wait, this seems very high. Let me see:\n\nWait, each of the three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100) each have 201 triples. So total triples are 3*201 = 603, but subtract the duplicates.\n\nEach of the all-100 triple is counted three times, so subtract 2 to count it once. The other overlaps are the edge triples where two variables are 100 and one is 200 or 0. Each of these six triples are counted once in one case each, so no overcounting there. Thus total is 603 - 2 = 601. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601. But wait, let me think again. The problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\", so ordered triples. So for example, (100, 200,0) and (200, 100,0) are different and both counted. Since in case A and case B respectively, so they are included in the total.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 601?\n\nWait, but let me verify with the example:\n\nThe triple (150,100,50) is counted in case2 (since b=100). The triple (100,150,50) is in case1 (a=100). (100,50,150) also in case1. (50,100,150) in case2. (50,150,100) in case3. (150,50,100) in case3. So all permutations are counted, and each is unique.\n\nThe total number of triples where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200 is, for each position of the 100:\n\nFor a=100: 201 triples (b from 0 to 200, c=200 -b)\n\nSimilarly for b=100 and c=100. So 3*201, but subtract overlaps.\n\nThe overlaps are when two variables are 100, which gives 3 triples (each pair of variables being 100, third 100 or 200? Wait, no. When two variables are 100, the third is 100 as well (since a + b + c=300). Wait, if two variables are 100, then third is 100. So the only triple where two variables are 100 is the all-100 triple.\n\nWait, actually, if two variables are 100, then third is 100, so it's the all-100 triple. So the edge cases where one variable is 200 and another is 0 and the third is 100 are the only ones with two variables not equal to 100. So those are the ones like (200,100,0), etc. Each of those has exactly one variable at 100, one at 200, one at 0.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is indeed 3*201 - 2 (for the all-100 counted three times) = 601.\n\nWait, but in the inclusion-exclusion, it's 603 -3 +1=601, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601. But I need to confirm.\n\nWait, but let me think of small cases to verify.\n\nSuppose instead of 300, the total is smaller, say a + b + c = 6, and the equation is something similar. But this might take time.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of another way.\n\nThe number of triples where one of the variables is fixed at 100 is 3*(201) but subtract duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of triples where one variable is exactly 100 is 3*(201 -1) +1. Because for each position (a,b,c), fixing it at 100 gives 201 triples, but the all-100 is counted three times. So total is 3*201 - 2*1 = 603 -2 =601. Yep, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c) satisfying the two equations. According to our analysis, it's 601. But I need to make sure.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the equation d e (d + e) =0. We assumed that variables are expressed as a =100 +d, etc., but does that substitution cover all possible solutions?\n\nYes, because the substitution was general: we set a =100 +d, b=100 +e, so that c=100 -d -e. So any triple (a,b,c) can be expressed in terms of d and e, so the equation derived must hold for any solution, leading to d e (d + e)=0. So all solutions must satisfy that equation, hence fall into one of the three cases. So the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples is 601.\n\nWait, but when I initially found (150,100,50), that's counted in case2, which is okay. So I think the answer is 601.\n\nBut I'm a bit uncertain because 601 seems a large number, but given that the variables can vary quite a bit, perhaps it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the number of solutions when one variable is fixed at 100.\n\nFor example, fix a=100. Then b +c =200. The number of non-negative integer solutions is 201 (from b=0 to 200). Similarly for b=100 and c=100. Thus total is 3*201 =603, but the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, so subtract 2 to get 601. So that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but the problem is from an Olympiad, perhaps expecting a smaller answer. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution?\n\nWait, let me check the equation again. We had:\n\nAfter substitution, we obtained that d e (d + e)=0, so either d=0,e=0, or d + e=0.\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\nEither d=0 (case1), e=0 (case2), or d +e=0 (case3).\n\nEach of these cases corresponds to one variable being 100. So the triples are those with at least one variable equal to 100. Because:\n\n- In case1 (d=0), a=100.\n\n- In case2 (e=0), b=100.\n\n- In case3 (d + e=0), c=100.\n\nTherefore, all solutions must have at least one of the variables equal to 100. Therefore, the total number of solutions is equal to the number of triples with at least one variable equal to 100, and satisfying the original equations.\n\nWait, but the original equations must also be satisfied. However, by the derivation, all triples with at least one variable equal to 100 automatically satisfy the second equation?\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\nSuppose a=100, then b +c =200. Then, let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nWith a=100:\n\n= 100\u00b2b + 100\u00b2c + b\u00b2*100 + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2*100 + c\u00b2b\n\n= 100\u00b2(b +c) + 100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc(b +c)\n\nSince b +c =200:\n\n= 100\u00b2*200 + 100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc*200\n\nCompute each term:\n\n100\u00b2 *200 = 10,000 *200 = 2,000,000\n\n100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) = 100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)\n\n200 bc\n\nThus total expression is:\n\n2,000,000 + 100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +200 bc\n\nBut we need this to be 6,000,000. So:\n\n2,000,000 + 100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +200 bc =6,000,000\n\nSubtract 2,000,000:\n\n100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +200 bc =4,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 + 2 bc =40,000\n\nBut b +c =200, so (b +c)^2 =40,000 = b\u00b2 +2 bc +c\u00b2.\n\nThus, the equation reduces to (b +c)^2 =40,000, which is exactly satisfied because b +c =200 \u21d2 200\u00b2=40,000. So yes, any triple with a=100 and b +c =200 automatically satisfies the second equation. Similarly for the other cases.\n\nTherefore, all triples with at least one variable equal to 100 automatically satisfy the second equation, provided they satisfy the first equation. Therefore, the count is indeed the number of triples with at least one variable equal to 100, which is 3*201 - 3*1 +1=601.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601.\n\nBut I need to ensure that there are no other solutions where none of the variables is 100. But according to the equation derived earlier, d e (d + e)=0 requires that either d=0,e=0, or d +e=0, so at least one of a,b,c must be 100. Thus, there are no other solutions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so including zero. So this is correct.\n\nHowever, I recall that when I first considered the case where one variable is zero, like (200,100,0), that is included in this count, and there are six such permutations. So all is well.\n\nTherefore, the number is 601.\n\nBut now I'm confused because in the initial analysis, I thought maybe 7 solutions, but clearly that was wrong. So I think 601 is correct. However, maybe the question counts ordered triples, so the answer is 601. But maybe I made a miscalculation in the inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\nNumber of triples with a=100: 201\n\nSimilarly for b=100:201\n\nSimilarly for c=100:201\n\nTotal: 3*201 =603\n\nSubtract the overlaps where two variables are 100:\n\nEach pair (a and b both 100 \u21d2 c=100), so there are 3 such triples (each pair), but they all result in the triple (100,100,100). So subtract 2 (because we've counted this triple three times, so need to subtract 2 to leave one).\n\nThus total is 603 - 2 =601.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601.\n\nBut wait, the problem is from an Olympiad, maybe the answer is different? Maybe I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait let me check with another example. Let me pick a triple where a=150, b=50, c=100. Then:\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 150\u00b2*50 + 150\u00b2*100 + 50\u00b2*150 + 50\u00b2*100 + 100\u00b2*150 + 100\u00b2*50\n\nCompute each term:\n\n150\u00b2*50 = 22500 *50 =1,125,000\n\n150\u00b2*100 =22500*100=2,250,000\n\n50\u00b2*150 =2500*150=375,000\n\n50\u00b2*100=2500*100=250,000\n\n100\u00b2*150=10,000*150=1,500,000\n\n100\u00b2*50=10,000*50=500,000\n\nSumming all terms:\n\n1,125,000 +2,250,000 =3,375,000\n\n+375,000 =3,750,000\n\n+250,000 =4,000,000\n\n+1,500,000 =5,500,000\n\n+500,000 =6,000,000. Correct.\n\nThus, this triple is valid and counted in the cases.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a, b, c) such that a + b + c = 300 and the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b equals 6,000,000. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's parse the problem. We have two equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n2. a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = 6,000,000\n\nWe need to find all triples (a, b, c) of nonnegative integers that satisfy both equations. Since the variables are symmetric, maybe there's some symmetry in the solution.\n\nLet me think about the second equation. The expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ... looks familiar. Maybe I can factor it somehow. Let me see:\n\nLet me try to factor the expression. Let's consider each term. For example, a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c can be factored as a\u00b2(b + c). Similarly, the other terms can be grouped:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nHmm, that's a good start. Since we know that a + b + c = 300, maybe we can substitute (b + c) with (300 - a), etc. Let's try that.\n\nSo substituting:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c)\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check:\n\nOriginal expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\nGrouping terms:\n\na\u00b2(b + c) + b\u00b2(a + c) + c\u00b2(a + b)\n\nYes, that's correct. Then since (b + c) = 300 - a, (a + c) = 300 - b, and (a + b) = 300 - c, substituting gives:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c)\n\nSo the second equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2(300 - a) + b\u00b2(300 - b) + c\u00b2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\nHmm. Let me see if there's another way to write this. Alternatively, maybe expanding the expression can lead to some simplification.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider another approach. Let me recall that the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b can also be written as (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc. Let me verify that:\n\nLet me compute (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca):\n\n= a(ab + bc + ca) + b(ab + bc + ca) + c(ab + bc + ca)\n\n= a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + abc + ab\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + abc + a c\u00b2 + b c\u00b2 + a c\u00b2 ?\n\nWait, maybe better to compute term by term:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = a(ab) + a(bc) + a(ca) + b(ab) + b(bc) + b(ca) + c(ab) + c(bc) + c(ca)\n\nSimplify each term:\n\n= a\u00b2b + a b c + a c\u00b2 + a b\u00b2 + b\u00b2c + b c a + c a\u00b2 + c b c + c\u00b2 a\n\nWait, but terms like a c\u00b2 and c a\u00b2 are same as a\u00b2c and c\u00b2a. Let me group similar terms:\n\n= a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b + 3abc\n\nTherefore, (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = (a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b) + 3abc\n\nTherefore, rearranged:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc\n\nTherefore, the given equation can be written as:\n\n(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nSince we know a + b + c = 300, substitute that in:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nHmm, so that gives:\n\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\nLet me divide both sides by 3 to simplify:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nHmm, okay. So now, we have two equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n\n2. 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nSo now, perhaps we can let variables be a, b, c, and try to find their relations. Maybe set variables in terms of symmetric functions?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider substituting variables. Let me denote S = a + b + c = 300, P = abc, and Q = ab + bc + ca. Then our second equation is 100 Q - P = 2,000,000.\n\nSo, we have:\n\n100 Q - P = 2,000,000\n\nAlso, we know that for three variables,\n\n(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)\n\nSo, 300^2 = (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2 Q\n\nTherefore, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 90000 - 2Q\n\nBut not sure if that helps yet.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of variables as symmetric, so maybe two variables are equal?\n\nSuppose that two variables are equal, say a = b. Then, since the equations are symmetric, perhaps this can lead us to a solution.\n\nLet me assume that a = b. Then, since a + b + c = 300, we have 2a + c = 300 => c = 300 - 2a.\n\nThen, substitute into the second equation:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nSince a = b and c = 300 - 2a,\n\nab = a^2,\n\nbc = a*(300 - 2a),\n\nca = a*(300 - 2a),\n\nTherefore, ab + bc + ca = a^2 + 2a(300 - 2a) = a^2 + 600a - 4a^2 = -3a^2 + 600a\n\nThen, abc = a * a * (300 - 2a) = a\u00b2(300 - 2a)\n\nSo plug into the equation:\n\n100*(-3a\u00b2 + 600a) - a\u00b2(300 - 2a) = 2,000,000\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 100*(-3a\u00b2 + 600a) = -300a\u00b2 + 60,000a\n\nSecond term: -a\u00b2(300 - 2a) = -300a\u00b2 + 2a\u00b3\n\nTherefore, combining:\n\n-300a\u00b2 + 60,000a - 300a\u00b2 + 2a\u00b3 = 2,000,000\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2a\u00b3 - 600a\u00b2 + 60,000a - 2,000,000 = 0\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\na\u00b3 - 300a\u00b2 + 30,000a - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nHmm, so we have a cubic equation in a. Let me see if this can be factored or solved.\n\nLet me try to see if a = 100 is a root. Plugging in a = 100:\n\n100\u00b3 - 300*(100)^2 + 30,000*100 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 300*10,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000\n\n= 1,000,000 - 3,000,000 + 3,000,000 - 1,000,000 = 0\n\nYes, so a = 100 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (a - 100) out.\n\nUsing polynomial division or synthetic division.\n\nDivide the cubic by (a - 100):\n\nCoefficients: 1 | -300 | 30,000 | -1,000,000\n\nDivided by (a - 100). Let's use synthetic division with root 100:\n\nBring down the 1.\n\nMultiply 1 by 100: 100. Add to next coefficient: -300 + 100 = -200\n\nMultiply -200 by 100 = -20,000. Add to next coefficient: 30,000 + (-20,000) = 10,000\n\nMultiply 10,000 by 100 = 1,000,000. Add to last term: -1,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 0\n\nSo the cubic factors as (a - 100)(a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000). Let me check the quadratic:\n\na\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000. Let's see if this factors further.\n\nDiscriminant D = (200)^2 - 4*1*10,000 = 40,000 - 40,000 = 0. So it's a perfect square.\n\nThus, a\u00b2 - 200a + 10,000 = (a - 100)^2\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (a - 100)^3 = 0\n\nWait, so the cubic equation is (a - 100)^3 = 0, so the only real root is a = 100 with multiplicity 3.\n\nTherefore, in this case, when a = b, the solution is a = b = 100, then c = 300 - 2a = 300 - 200 = 100. So the triple is (100,100,100). But that would mean all three variables are equal. Let me check if that satisfies the original equation.\n\nCheck for a = b = c = 100:\n\nCompute the expression a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nEach term is 100\u00b2*100 = 1,000,000. Since there are 6 terms, total is 6,000,000. Which matches. So that works.\n\nTherefore, when assuming two variables equal, we get the solution (100,100,100). But are there other solutions where variables are not equal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are other solutions where two variables are equal but different from 100? Wait, but in this case, the cubic only had a = 100 as a root. So maybe when we set a = b, the only solution is when all three are equal. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where all three variables are different. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe suppose that one of the variables is zero. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose c = 0. Then the equations become a + b = 300 and the second equation becomes a\u00b2b + a\u00b2*0 + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2a + 0\u00b2b = a\u00b2b + ab\u00b2 = ab(a + b) = ab * 300.\n\nSet that equal to 6,000,000. So ab * 300 = 6,000,000 => ab = 20,000.\n\nSo, with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. Let's see if this is possible.\n\nSo, solving for a and b. Let me denote variables:\n\nLet a and b be nonnegative integers with a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000.\n\nThe quadratic equation would be x\u00b2 - 300x + 20,000 = 0.\n\nLet me compute discriminant D = 300\u00b2 - 4*1*20,000 = 90,000 - 80,000 = 10,000.\n\nSo sqrt(D) = 100. Therefore, roots are [300 \u00b1 100]/2 = (400)/2 = 200 and (200)/2 = 100. Wait, 300 - 100 is 200, so 200/2 = 100. Wait, so roots are 200 and 100.\n\nThus, solutions are (a, b) = (200, 100) or (100, 200). So with c=0, we have triples (200,100,0), (100,200,0), and similarly if we set a=0 or b=0, we would get other permutations.\n\nWait, but hold on, since c is set to 0, so (200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (0,100,200). So total of 6 solutions here. Wait, but let me check:\n\nWait, actually, if c=0, then the variables are (a, b, 0) where a + b = 300 and ab = 20,000. So the solutions for (a,b) are (200,100) and (100,200). So the triples would be (200, 100, 0), (100, 200, 0), (200, 0, 100), (0, 200, 100), (100, 0, 200), (0, 100, 200). That's 6 ordered triples. Since the problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers\", so order matters here? Wait, actually, in the problem statement, it says \"the number of triples (a,b,c)\", so I think the order matters, so these are distinct.\n\nBut let me confirm if these actually satisfy the second equation. Let me take (200,100,0):\n\nCompute a\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\n= (200\u00b2)(100) + (200\u00b2)(0) + (100\u00b2)(200) + (100\u00b2)(0) + (0\u00b2)(200) + (0\u00b2)(100)\n\n= (40,000)(100) + 0 + (10,000)(200) + 0 + 0 + 0\n\n= 4,000,000 + 2,000,000 = 6,000,000. Yes, that works.\n\nSimilarly, all those permutations would work. So these 6 triples are valid.\n\nSo that's 6 solutions. Then, the triple where all are 100 is another solution. So that's 1 more, so total so far 7. But are there more?\n\nWait, perhaps there are other cases where two variables are equal but not 100? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when one variable is different from the other two but not zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe when two variables are equal but not 100, but the cubic equation didn't show that. Wait, when I assumed a = b, the only solution was a = b = c = 100. So perhaps that's the only case where two variables are equal?\n\nAlternatively, suppose that two variables are equal but not 100, but that would require a different approach. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are solutions where all three variables are different. Let me see if there are any.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of variables in terms of variables x, y, z where x = a, y = b, z = c. Since the equations are symmetric, perhaps we can consider cases based on the number of variables equal.\n\nCase 1: All three variables equal. Then a = b = c = 100, which works as we saw.\n\nCase 2: Two variables equal, third different. Let's suppose a = b \u2260 c. Then as we saw, the only solution here is when all three are equal, so maybe there are no solutions where two are equal and the third is different?\n\nWait, when we set a = b, the only solution was a = b = c = 100. So perhaps if two variables are equal but different from 100, there is no solution. So maybe the only solution in this case is the all-100 case.\n\nCase 3: All variables different. So, we need to find triples where a, b, c are all different and non-zero. Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps other solutions where one variable is zero. Wait, we already considered the case where one variable is zero, leading to 6 solutions. So perhaps those are the only ones?\n\nWait, but let me check another case where two variables are zero. Suppose two variables are zero, say b = c =0, then a = 300. Then the second equation becomes a\u00b2b + ... but all terms would be zero, since b and c are zero, so the sum is zero, which is not equal to 6,000,000. So that's invalid. So triples with two zeros don't work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe triples where one variable is non-zero and others are zero? That's already covered when two variables are zero, which gives zero, so no.\n\nTherefore, the only solutions are either the all-100 triple or the triples with two numbers (200,100,0) and permutations. So total solutions would be 1 + 6 = 7? But wait, let me check if there are other possibilities where none of the variables are equal and none are zero.\n\nWait, perhaps there are triples where all three variables are different and non-zero. Let me see.\n\nSuppose a, b, c are all different and non-zero. Let me see if such triples can satisfy the equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me denote that equation again:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nWe can rewrite this as:\n\nabc = 100(ab + bc + ca) - 2,000,000.\n\nHmm, perhaps trying to find integer solutions here with a + b + c = 300.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of variables as symmetric and set up equations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe set variables x = a, y = b, z = c, with x + y + z = 300, and the other equation as above.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can let variables be in terms of deviations from 100. Since when all are equal, they are 100, so maybe set a = 100 + p, b = 100 + q, c = 100 + r. Then p + q + r = 0. Let's see:\n\nLet me try this substitution. Let a = 100 + p, b = 100 + q, c = 100 + r. Then:\n\na + b + c = 300 => (100 + p) + (100 + q) + (100 + r) = 300 => 300 + (p + q + r) = 300 => p + q + r = 0.\n\nNow, substitute into the second equation:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nCompute each term:\n\nFirst, ab + bc + ca:\n\nab = (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + p) + pq\n\nSimilarly for bc and ca. So:\n\nab + bc + ca = [100\u00b2 + 100(p + q) + pq] + [100\u00b2 + 100(q + r) + qr] + [100\u00b2 + 100(r + p) + rp]\n\n= 3*100\u00b2 + 100[ (p + q) + (q + r) + (r + p) ] + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nSimplify:\n\n3*10,000 + 100[2(p + q + r)] + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nBut since p + q + r = 0, the middle term becomes 100*2*0 = 0. So:\n\nab + bc + ca = 30,000 + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nSimilarly, compute abc:\n\nabc = (100 + p)(100 + q)(100 + r)\n\nExpanding this:\n\nFirst multiply (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + p) + pq\n\nThen multiply by (100 + r):\n\n= [100\u00b2 + 100(p + q) + pq]*(100 + r)\n\n= 100\u00b2*(100) + 100\u00b2*r + 100(p + q)*100 + 100(p + q)*r + pq*100 + pq*r\n\nHmm, this might get complicated, but let me see:\n\nAlternatively, expand step by step:\n\n= 100*(100 + q)(100 + r) + p*(100 + q)(100 + r)\n\nFirst term: 100*(100\u00b2 + 100(r + q) + qr)\n\nSecond term: p*(100\u00b2 + 100(r + q) + qr)\n\nSo altogether:\n\n= 100*100\u00b2 + 100*100(r + q) + 100*qr + p*100\u00b2 + p*100(r + q) + p*qr\n\nCombine terms:\n\n= 100\u00b3 + 100\u00b2(r + q) + 100 qr + 100\u00b2 p + 100 p (r + q) + p qr\n\nBut since p + q + r = 0 => r + q = -p. Substitute:\n\n= 100\u00b3 + 100\u00b2*(-p) + 100 qr + 100\u00b2 p + 100 p*(-p) + p qr\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 100\u00b3\n\nSecond term: -100\u00b2 p\n\nThird term: +100 qr\n\nFourth term: +100\u00b2 p\n\nFifth term: -100 p\u00b2\n\nSixth term: + p qr\n\nSo combine like terms:\n\n-100\u00b2 p + 100\u00b2 p cancels out.\n\nLeaving:\n\n100\u00b3 + 100 qr -100 p\u00b2 + p qr - 100 p\u00b2? Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait fifth term is -100 p\u00b2, sixth term is p qr. So altogether:\n\n100\u00b3 + 100 qr -100 p\u00b2 + p qr\n\nWait, also, the third term was +100 qr and sixth term + p qr, so total for qr terms: 100 qr + p qr = qr(100 + p)\n\nBut p + q + r =0 => p = - (q + r). So substituting p:\n\nqr(100 - (q + r))\n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me see if there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since p + q + r = 0, we can write r = -p - q. Then substitute into the equations.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSet r = -p - q.\n\nThen, ab + bc + ca = 30,000 + (pq + qr + rp)\n\nCompute pq + qr + rp:\n\n= pq + q*(-p - q) + p*(-p - q)\n\n= pq - pq - q\u00b2 - p\u00b2 - pq\n\nWait, let's compute step by step:\n\nqr = q*(-p - q) = -pq - q\u00b2\n\nrp = p*(-p - q) = -p\u00b2 - pq\n\nSo pq + qr + rp = pq + (-pq - q\u00b2) + (-p\u00b2 - pq) = pq - pq - q\u00b2 - p\u00b2 - pq = -p\u00b2 - q\u00b2 - pq\n\nTherefore, ab + bc + ca = 30,000 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq)\n\nSimilarly, compute abc:\n\nabc = (100 + p)(100 + q)(100 + r) = (100 + p)(100 + q)(100 - p - q)\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nLet me first compute (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(q + p) + pq as before.\n\nThen multiply by (100 - p - q):\n\nLet me denote A = 100 + p + q, but maybe it's better to just proceed step by step.\n\nLet me let\u2019s denote term1 = (100 + p)(100 + q) = 100\u00b2 + 100(p + q) + pq\n\nMultiply term1 by (100 - (p + q)):\n\n= [100\u00b2 + 100(p + q) + pq] * [100 - (p + q)]\n\nLet me set s = p + q for simplicity. Then:\n\n= [100\u00b2 + 100 s + pq] * [100 - s]\n\nExpand this:\n\n= 100\u00b2*(100 - s) + 100 s (100 - s) + pq (100 - s)\n\n= 100\u00b3 - 100\u00b2 s + 100 s * 100 - 100 s\u00b2 + 100 pq - pq s\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 100\u00b3\n\nSecond term: -100\u00b2 s\n\nThird term: +10,000 s\n\nFourth term: -100 s\u00b2\n\nFifth term: +100 pq\n\nSixth term: -pq s\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nTerms with s\u00b2: -100 s\u00b2\n\nTerms with s: (-100\u00b2 s + 10,000 s - pq s) = s(-100\u00b2 + 10,000 - pq )\n\nBut 100\u00b2 is 10,000, so -10,000 s + 10,000 s cancels out. So that term is -pq s.\n\nThen constants: 100\u00b3 + 100 pq\n\nThus, overall:\n\nabc = 100\u00b3 + 100 pq - 100 s\u00b2 - pq s\n\nBut s = p + q, so s\u00b2 = (p + q)^2 = p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\nabc = 100\u00b3 + 100 pq - 100(p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2) - pq(p + q)\n\n= 100\u00b3 + 100 pq - 100 p\u00b2 - 200 pq - 100 q\u00b2 - p\u00b2 q - p q\u00b2\n\nHmm, this is getting really complicated. Maybe this substitution isn't helpful. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let's recall the equation we need:\n\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nSubstituting the expressions in terms of p and q:\n\nab + bc + ca = 30,000 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq)\n\nabc = ?\n\nAlternatively, let me substitute into the equation:\n\n100*(30,000 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq)) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nThus,\n\n3,000,000 - 100(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nTherefore,\n\n-100(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq) - abc = -1,000,000\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\n100(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + pq) + abc = 1,000,000\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me see if I can express abc in terms of p and q. Alternatively, maybe this is too involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps trying specific values. Since we already have two cases: all equal and one zero, giving 7 solutions. Maybe that's all?\n\nWait, but let me check another case. Suppose that two variables are 150 and the third is 0. Wait, then a + b + c = 150 + 150 + 0 = 300. Let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + ... Let me compute for (150,150,0):\n\n= 150\u00b2*150 + 150\u00b2*0 + 150\u00b2*150 + 150\u00b2*0 + 0\u00b2*150 + 0\u00b2*150\n\n= 2*(150^3) + 0 + 0 + 0\n\n= 2*(3,375,000) = 6,750,000, which is more than 6,000,000. So that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, (200, 100, 0) gives exactly 6,000,000 as we saw.\n\nHow about (150, 100, 50):\n\nCheck sum: 150 + 100 +50 = 300.\n\nCompute the expression:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 150\u00b2*100 + 150\u00b2*50 + 100\u00b2*150 + 100\u00b2*50 + 50\u00b2*150 + 50\u00b2*100\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n150\u00b2*100 = 22,500 *100 = 2,250,000\n\n150\u00b2*50 = 22,500*50 = 1,125,000\n\n100\u00b2*150 = 10,000*150 = 1,500,000\n\n100\u00b2*50 = 10,000*50 = 500,000\n\n50\u00b2*150 = 2,500*150 = 375,000\n\n50\u00b2*100 = 2,500*100 = 250,000\n\nTotal sum:\n\n2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 = 4,875,000\n\n+500,000 = 5,375,000\n\n+375,000 = 5,750,000\n\n+250,000 = 6,000,000. Wait, that's exactly 6,000,000! So (150,100,50) is another solution!\n\nWait, so that's a new solution where all three variables are different and non-zero. Hmm, so my previous assumption that only the all-equal case and the cases with a zero were the only solutions was wrong. So there must be more solutions.\n\nSo this complicates things. Let me check my calculation again.\n\nWait, let me recalculate (150, 100,50):\n\na=150, b=100, c=50:\n\na\u00b2b = 150\u00b2 *100 = 22500 *100 = 2,250,000\n\na\u00b2c = 22500 *50 = 1,125,000\n\nb\u00b2a = 100\u00b2 *150 = 10,000 *150 = 1,500,000\n\nb\u00b2c = 10,000 *50 = 500,000\n\nc\u00b2a = 2500 *150 = 375,000\n\nc\u00b2b = 2500 *100 = 250,000\n\nAdding all up:\n\n2,250,000 + 1,125,000 = 3,375,000\n\n+1,500,000 = 4,875,000\n\n+500,000 = 5,375,000\n\n+375,000 = 5,750,000\n\n+250,000 = 6,000,000. Yes, that's correct. So this is a valid solution. So this is a new solution where all three variables are different. So my previous approach missed this.\n\nTherefore, there are solutions with all variables different. Hmm, so I need a better approach.\n\nLet me think again. Let me see if I can find all solutions.\n\nWe have the equations:\n\n1. a + b + c = 300\n\n2. 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\nLet me denote S = a + b + c = 300,\n\nLet me denote P = abc,\n\nand Q = ab + bc + ca.\n\nThen the second equation is 100Q - P = 2,000,000 => P = 100Q - 2,000,000.\n\nWe also know from algebra that for three variables:\n\n(a + b + c)^3 = a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + 3(a + b)(b + c)(a + c)\n\nWait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, the relation between S, Q, and the sum of squares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express in terms of variables.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of variables as a, b, c being roots of a cubic equation. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider that if a, b, c are roots of the cubic equation x\u00b3 - Sx\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0. So:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - P = 0\n\nBut since P = 100Q - 2,000,000,\n\nthen the equation becomes:\n\nx\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - (100Q - 2,000,000) = x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Qx - 100Q + 2,000,000 = x\u00b3 - 300x\u00b2 + Q(x - 100) + 2,000,000 = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables as follows.\n\nLet me denote variables x = a, y = b, z = c.\n\nLet me see if there is a substitution or relation that can be exploited.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps set variables in terms of two variables. Let me set a = 100 + d, b = 100 + e, so that c = 300 - a - b = 300 - (100 + d) - (100 + e) = 100 - d - e.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation 100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000.\n\nLet me compute ab + bc + ca and abc in terms of d and e.\n\nFirst, compute ab:\n\n(100 + d)(100 + e) = 100\u00b2 + 100(e + d) + de\n\nCompute bc:\n\n(100 + e)(100 - d - e) = (100 + e)(100 - (d + e)) = 100*(100) -100*(d + e) + e*100 - e*(d + e)\n\n= 10,000 -100d -100e + 100e - e d - e\u00b2\n\n= 10,000 -100d - e d - e\u00b2\n\nSimilarly, compute ca:\n\n(100 + d)(100 - d - e) = (100 + d)(100 - (d + e)) = 100*(100) -100*(d + e) + d*100 - d*(d + e)\n\n= 10,000 -100d -100e + 100d - d\u00b2 -d e\n\n= 10,000 -100e - d\u00b2 - d e\n\nNow, ab + bc + ca:\n\nab = 10,000 + 100(d + e) + de\n\nbc = 10,000 -100d - e d - e\u00b2\n\nca = 10,000 -100e - d\u00b2 - d e\n\nAdding all together:\n\nab + bc + ca = [10,000 + 100(d + e) + de] + [10,000 -100d - e d - e\u00b2] + [10,000 -100e - d\u00b2 - d e]\n\nCombine term by term:\n\nConstant terms: 10,000 +10,000 +10,000 = 30,000\n\nTerms with d:\n\n100d (from ab) -100d (from bc) -100e (from ca's -100e term?

So e \u2208 {-100, ..., 100}. But since a, b, c are nonnegative integers, e must be integer between -100 and 100. But also, since variables are nonnegative, b = 100 + e \u2265 0 \u21d2 e \u2265 -100, and c = 100 - e \u2265 0 \u21d2 e \u2264 100. So e can be any integer from -100 to 100, but also, since a, b, c must be nonnegative, but a is fixed at 100, so e can be from -100 to 100, but also, b and c must be nonnegative. However, since e can be negative, let's see:\n\nWait, but if e is negative, say e = -k where k is positive, then b = 100 - k and c = 100 + k. Since b must be nonnegative, 100 - k \u22650 \u21d2 k \u2264100, so e \u2265 -100.\n\nThus, e can range from -100 to 100, but in integers. However, note that variables must be nonnegative integers. So e can be any integer from -100 to 100, but with the constraints above.\n\nHowever, we also need to ensure that in the original problem, the triple (a, b, c) must satisfy the second equation. However, in this case, since we derived that d e (d + e)=0, so with d =0, it's valid.\n\nBut let me see what triples this gives. Since d=0, a=100, b=100+e, c=100 - e.\n\nSo the triple is (100, 100 + e, 100 - e). Since e can be any integer from -100 to 100, but such that b and c are nonnegative. So e \u2208 {-100, ..., 100} but with constraints.\n\nWait, but let me check if this is valid. Let me pick e = 50, then the triple is (100, 150, 50). Which is exactly the solution we found earlier (150, 100,50) but reordered. Since variables are ordered, so this would be a different ordered triple, but since the problem counts ordered triples, that's okay.\n\nWait, but actually, in this case, when d=0, e can range from -100 to 100. However, for each e, we get a unique triple (100, 100 + e, 100 - e). However, we have to ensure that all variables are nonnegative.\n\nIndeed, when e = 100, then b = 200, c=0. So that gives (100,200,0), which is one of the earlier solutions.\n\nWhen e = -100, then b=0, c=200, giving (100,0,200). Also valid.\n\nSimilarly, e=50 gives (100,150,50), and e=0 gives (100,100,100). So all these are valid.\n\nSo in this case, d=0 gives us all triples where a=100 and b and c differ by e. So the number of solutions here would be the number of integers e from -100 to 100, but with b and c nonnegative. Since e can be from -100 to 100, that's 201 values (since inclusive). However, when e =100, c becomes 0, which is allowed. Similarly, e =-100 gives b=0. So total 201 solutions here. However, but wait, in this case, a is fixed at 100, so each e gives a unique triple. However, in this case, we have to consider that the variables are ordered triples. However, in our substitution, we fixed a =100, so this counts all triples where a=100 and b and c vary as above. However, the problem counts all ordered triples, so triples where a isn't necessarily 100 but could be in any position. Wait, but in this case, we set a=100 + d, so d=0 means a=100. So this case only counts triples where a is exactly 100. The other cases where d or e are non-zero would have to be considered as well, but let's proceed.\n\nCase 2: e =0.\n\nSimilarly, if e =0, then by symmetry, the triple would be (100 + d, 100, 100 - d). This is symmetric to case1, so this would give another set of triples where b=100, and a and c vary similarly. So similarly, this would give another 201 triples. However, note that when d=0 here, it corresponds to the triple (100,100,100), which is already counted in case1. So there is overlap here. So we have to be careful not to double count.\n\nCase3: d + e =0.\n\nHere, d + e =0 \u21d2 e = -d.\n\nSo substituting e = -d, then c =100 - d - e = 100 - d - (-d)=100.\n\nSo c=100. Then, variables are (100 + d, 100 - d, 100). So similar to the previous cases but with c fixed at 100. This would also give triples where c=100, and a and b vary such that a =100 +d, b=100 -d. So again, this gives another 201 triples with c=100. Again overlapping when d=0.\n\nTherefore, the total solutions from all three cases would be 3*201 - 3 +1? Wait, need to think carefully.\n\nWait, actually, the three cases (d=0, e=0, d+e=0) each give 201 solutions, but overlapping when two or all three conditions are met.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n- The triple (100,100,100) is counted in all three cases (when d=e=0, which also satisfies d + e=0).\n\n- Triples where two variables are 100 are counted in two cases. For example, (100, 200,0) is in case1 (d=0, e=100) and case3 (since d + e =0? Wait, no. Let me see:\n\nWait, in case3 where d + e =0, variables are (a, b, c) = (100 + d, 100 -d, 100). So to get (100, 200,0), set d=0, but then that would be (100,100,100). To get (100,200,0), need a=100, b=200, c=0. That would be in case1 where e=100 (since a=100, b=100 + e, so e=100 gives b=200 and c=0). So that is only in case1.\n\nWait, so actually, the overlaps between the cases are only at the all-100 triple. So:\n\nEach case (d=0, e=0, d+e=0) gives 201 solutions, but the all-100 triple is counted three times, and other overlaps occur when two variables are 100?\n\nWait, let me think:\n\nTake case1 (d=0):\n\ntriples are (100, 100+e, 100 -e). So if e=0, it's (100,100,100). If e=100, it's (100,200,0). If e=-100, it's (100,0,200). Similarly for other e.\n\nCase2 (e=0):\n\ntriples are (100 +d, 100, 100 -d). Similarly, d can be from -100 to 100. For d=0, same triple. For d=100, (200,100,0). For d=-100, (0,100,200).\n\nCase3 (d + e =0):\n\ntriples are (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). Here, d can range from -100 to 100. For d=0, same triple. For d=100, (200,0,100). For d=-100, (0,200,100).\n\nThus, the only overlapping triple among all three cases is (100,100,100). The other triples where two variables are 100 are counted in two cases. For example, (200,100,0) is in case1 (when e=100) and case2 (when d=100). Similarly, (100,200,0) is in case1 (e=100) and case3 (d=100? Wait, no, in case3, to get (100,200,0):\n\nWait, in case3, variables are (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get (100,200,0):\n\nWait, that would require 100 -d =200 \u21d2 d =-100, then the first variable would be 100 + (-100)=0, third is 100. So (0,200,100). Not (100,200,0). So (200,100,0) is in case2 (when d=100) and case1 (when e= -100? Wait no. Wait case1 is (100, 100+e, 100 -e). To get (200,100,0), need 100+e =200 \u21d2 e=100, then c=100 -100=0, so yes, that's in case1 (e=100). Also, in case2, when d=100, we get (200,100,0). So yes, (200,100,0) is in both case1 and case2. Similarly for other triples with two variables at 100.\n\nTherefore, to compute the total number of distinct triples from all three cases:\n\nEach of the three cases (d=0, e=0, d+e=0) has 201 triples. However, the overlaps are:\n\n- The triple (100,100,100) is counted three times (once in each case).\n\n- Each of the triples with two variables at 100 and one at 200 or 0 is counted twice (once in two cases).\n\n- The other triples (where only one variable is 100 and the others are different) are counted once (in exactly one case).\n\nTherefore, total triples from the three cases:\n\nTotal = (3 * 201) - (number of overlaps)\n\nFirst, subtract the overcounts:\n\nThe all-100 triple is counted three times, so we need to subtract 2 to leave it counted once.\n\nThen, for each of the triples with two variables at 100 and one at 200 or 0:\n\nThere are six such triples:\n\n(200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (0,100,200).\n\nEach of these is counted in two cases. So each is counted twice, so total overcount is 6*(2-1)=6. So need to subtract 6.\n\nTherefore total:\n\nTotal triples = 3*201 - 2 (for the all-100 triple) - 6 (for the six edge triples) = 603 - 2 -6 = 595?\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nWait actually, the formula for inclusion-exclusion here might be:\n\nTotal = A + B + C - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC\n\nWhere A, B, C are the three cases.\n\nWhere A is case1 (d=0), B case2 (e=0), C case3 (d+e=0).\n\nCompute:\n\nA = 201, B=201, C=201.\n\nAB: overlaps between A and B. These are triples that are in both A and B.\n\nTo be in both A and B: need both d=0 and e=0. So that's only the triple (100,100,100).\n\nSimilarly, AC: overlaps between A and C. To be in A (d=0) and C (d + e =0), then d=0 and e=0. So again only (100,100,100).\n\nSimilarly, BC: overlaps between B and C. To be in B (e=0) and C (d + e=0 \u21d2 d=0). So again only (100,100,100).\n\nABC: overlaps in all three, which is also (100,100,100).\n\nThus:\n\nTotal = 201 + 201 + 201 - (1 +1 +1) +1 = 603 - 3 +1 = 601.\n\nWait, but this contradicts the previous approach. Which is correct?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps inclusion-exclusion is better.\n\nTotal triples in A \u222a B \u222a C = A + B + C - (AB + AC + BC) + ABC\n\n= 201*3 - 3*1 +1 = 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nHmm, so that suggests 601 triples? But this contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first approach.\n\nWait, but let's see:\n\nAlternatively, if the three cases each have 201 triples, and their intersections (AB, AC, BC) each have 1 triple (the all-100 one), and the intersection of all three is also that one triple. So:\n\nTotal = 201+201+201 - (1 +1 +1) +1 = 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nHmm. So according to inclusion-exclusion, it's 601.\n\nBut let me think about the triples with two variables at 100 and the third at 200 or 0. For example, (200,100,0). This is in both case A and case B:\n\n- In case A (d=0): a=100, so to get (200,100,0), set e=100.\n\n- In case B (e=0): b=100, so set d=100, which gives a=200, c=0.\n\nTherefore, this triple is counted in both A and B, so in AB. Similarly, each of the six triples with two 100s and a 200 or 0 is counted in two cases, so each is in two of the intersections AB, AC, or BC. Wait, but actually, each of those triples is in exactly two of the cases.\n\nWait, for example, (200,100,0) is in A and B, so counted in AB. Similarly:\n\n(100,200,0) is in A and C? Wait:\n\nWait (100,200,0) is in case A (d=0, e=100) and case C (d + e =0? Let me see case C is d + e =0, so variables are (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get (100,200,0):\n\nWait, to have c=0, need 100 =0? No, c is always 100 in case C. So (100,200,0) is not in case C. Wait, so perhaps my earlier thought was wrong.\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nThe triples with two variables at 100 and one at 200 or 0 are:\n\n(200,100,0), (100,200,0), (200,0,100), (0,200,100), (100,0,200), (0,100,200).\n\nEach of these is in exactly two of the cases:\n\n- (200,100,0): in case A (d=0, e=100) and case B (e=0, d=100). So in AB.\n\n- (100,200,0): in case A (d=0, e=100? Wait, no, to get (100,200,0), in case A, e=100 gives b=200, c=0. Yes, so that's in case A. To get into case B (e=0), we need to have b=100, so that's not here. Wait, actually:\n\nWait (100,200,0) is in case A (as above), and is it in any other case?\n\nIn case C (d + e =0), variables are (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get (100,200,0), need third variable to be 0, but in case C, the third variable is 100. So no. So (100,200,0) is only in case A and case B?\n\nWait no:\n\nWait case B is e=0. So variables are (100 +d, 100, 100 -d). To get (100,200,0), set 100 -d =0 \u21d2 d=100, so first variable is 200, second is 100. So (200,100,0). So (200,100,0) is in case B. Whereas (100,200,0) is in case A but not in case B. Wait, so:\n\nWait (100,200,0) is in case A (d=0, e=100) gives (100, 100+100, 100-100) = (100,200,0). So case A includes this. To get this in case B, we need e=0, so variables are (100 +d, 100, 100 -d). To get the second variable to be 200, set 100=200? No, so it's not in case B. So actually, (100,200,0) is only in case A. Wait, then my previous thought was wrong.\n\nWait, so maybe each of the six edge triples is in only one case? Let me check:\n\nTake (200,100,0):\n\n- Case A: yes (d=0, e=100).\n\n- Case B: yes (e=0, d=100).\n\n- Case C: (d + e =0). To get (200,100,0), variables would have to be (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). The third variable must be 100, but here it is 0. So no.\n\nSo (200,100,0) is in both A and B.\n\n(100,200,0):\n\n- Case A: yes (e=100).\n\n- Case B: To be in case B (e=0), variables are (100 +d, 100, 100 -d). To have second variable 200, set 100=200? No. So no.\n\n- Case C: Not applicable.\n\nSo only in A.\n\nWait, so maybe only three of the edge triples are in two cases, and the others are only in one case?\n\nWait let's see:\n\nTake (200,0,100):\n\nThis is in case C (d + e=0):\n\nLet me see: variables are (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get third variable 100, so if first is 200, then d=100 \u21d2 second is 0, so (200,0,100). So yes, this is in case C. Also, is it in any other case?\n\nCase A: (100, 100 +e, 100 -e). To get (200,0,100), need first variable to be 200 \u21d2 d=100, but in case A, d=0. So no. Case B: e=0 \u21d2 variables (100 +d,100, 100 -d). To get (200,0,100), set second variable to 0 \u21d2 100=0? No. So only in case C.\n\nSimilarly, (0,200,100):\n\nVariables (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get first variable 0, d=-100 \u21d2 second variable 200, third 100. So yes, in case C. Also, in any other case?\n\nCase B: e=0. To get first variable 0 \u21d2 d=-100 \u21d2 (0, 100, 200). Not this one. So only in case C.\n\nSimilarly, (0,100,200):\n\nThis would be in case B (e=0):\n\nVariables (100 +d, 100, 100 -d). To get first variable 0 \u21d2 d=-100 \u21d2 third variable 200. So (0,100,200) is in case B. Also in any other case? Case C? Let's see:\n\nCase C requires d + e =0. Variables (100 +d, 100 -d,100). To get (0,100,200), third variable is 200, but case C third variable is always 100. So no. So only in case B.\n\nSimilarly, (100,0,200):\n\nIn case A (d=0): variables (100, 100 +e, 100 -e). To get third variable 200, set e= -100 \u21d2 (100, 0, 200). So yes, in case A. Also in case C? Let me see case C:\n\nVariables (100 +d, 100 -d, 100). To get third variable 200 \u21d2 100=200, no. So only case A.\n\nSo, of the six edge triples:\n\n- (200,100,0) is in both A and B\n\n- (200,0,100) is in C only\n\n- (100,200,0) is in A only\n\n- (0,200,100) is in C only\n\n- (0,100,200) is in B only\n\n- (100,0,200) is in A only\n\nThus, only one of the six edge triples is in two cases: (200,100,0) is in A and B.\n\nSimilarly, the triple (0,100,200) is in B only, so not overlapping with anything else except the all-100 triple.\n\nWait, so the only overlapping triples between the cases are:\n\n- The all-100 triple, counted in all three cases.\n\n- The triple (200,100,0) counted in both A and B.\n\nSimilarly, the triple (100,200,0) is only in A, (0,200,100) only in C, etc.\n\nTherefore, the overlaps between the cases are:\n\nAB: (200,100,0) and (100,100,100)\n\nAC: (100,0,200) and (100,100,100)\n\nBC: (0,100,200) and (100,100,100)\n\nWait, no, let's see:\n\nAB is the intersection of cases A and B. Which triples are in both A and B?\n\nA is triples where a=100, so first variable is 100.\n\nB is triples where b=100, so second variable is 100.\n\nThus, the intersection AB consists of triples where a=100 and b=100, so (100,100,c). Since a + b + c =300, c=100. So only (100,100,100).\n\nWait, but earlier I thought (200,100,0) was in both A and B. Wait, no:\n\nWait in case A: a=100. To have (200,100,0), a is 200, so it's not in case A. Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, case A is when d=0, so a=100 +0 =100. So all triples in case A have a=100. So (200,100,0) has a=200, so it can't be in case A.\n\nWait, this is a critical mistake. Earlier when I considered case1 (d=0):\n\nVariables are (a, b, c) = (100, 100 +e, 100 -e). So a is always 100. So the triple (200,100,0) cannot be in case A, because a must be 100.\n\nWait, this is a big mistake. I must have confused variables earlier. Let me correct this.\n\nLet me re-express the substitution:\n\nWe set a = 100 + d,\n\nb = 100 + e,\n\nc = 300 - a - b = 300 - (100 + d) - (100 + e) = 100 - d - e.\n\nThus:\n\n- In case1 (d=0):\n\na =100,\n\nb =100 + e,\n\nc =100 - e.\n\nSo, a is always 100.\n\n- In case2 (e=0):\n\nb=100,\n\na=100 + d,\n\nc=100 - d.\n\nSo, b is always 100.\n\n- In case3 (d + e =0 \u21d2 e = -d):\n\nc =100,\n\na=100 + d,\n\nb=100 -d.\n\nThus, c is always 100.\n\nTherefore, the triples in each case have one variable fixed at 100:\n\n- case1: a=100\n\n- case2: b=100\n\n- case3: c=100\n\nTherefore, the triple (200,100,0) has a=200, b=100, c=0. This would be in case2 (since b=100 is fixed). So in case2, variables are (a, 100, c). To get (200,100,0), set a=200, c=0. Since a =100 + d \u21d2 d=100, so yes, it's in case2.\n\nSimilarly, the triple (100,200,0) has a=100, so it's in case1. To get b=200, set e=100 \u21d2 c=0. So (100,200,0) is in case1.\n\nSimilarly, (200,0,100) has c=100, so is in case3. To get a=200, set d=100 \u21d2 b=0.\n\nTherefore, the overlaps between the cases are:\n\n- The triple (100,100,100) is in all three cases.\n\n- Any triple with two variables at 100 and one at 200 or 0 is in exactly one case. For example:\n\n(100,100,100) is in all.\n\n(200,100,0) is in case2.\n\n(100,200,0) is in case1.\n\n(200,0,100) is in case3.\n\n(0,100,200) is in case2 (since b=100? No, b=100 is in case2. Wait (0,100,200):\n\na=0, b=100, c=200. This is in case2 (b=100). So yes.\n\n(0,200,100): a=0, b=200, c=100. This is in case3 (c=100).\n\n(100,0,200): a=100, b=0, c=200. In case1 (a=100).\n\nTherefore, none of the edge triples (with two variables at 100 and one at 200 or 0) are counted in more than one case except the all-100 triple.\n\nThus, the only overlap between any two cases is the all-100 triple. For example, the intersection of case1 and case2 is the triples where a=100 and b=100 \u21d2 c=100. So only (100,100,100).\n\nSimilarly for other intersections.\n\nTherefore, using inclusion-exclusion:\n\nTotal triples = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A\u2229B| - |A\u2229C| - |B\u2229C| + |A\u2229B\u2229C|\n\nEach of |A|, |B|, |C| is 201.\n\nEach intersection |A\u2229B|, |A\u2229C|, |B\u2229C| is 1 (only the all-100 triple).\n\nThe intersection of all three is also 1.\n\nThus:\n\nTotal = 201*3 - 1*3 +1 = 603 -3 +1 = 601.\n\nTherefore, the three cases contribute 601 distinct triples.\n\nHowever, we also need to consider if there are solutions outside of these three cases.\n\nRecall that the condition from the equation was d e (d + e) =0, which requires that either d=0, e=0, or d + e=0. Thus, all solutions must fall into one of these three cases. Therefore, there are no solutions outside of these cases.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is 601.\n\nWait but wait, in our earlier example, the triple (150, 100,50) was valid. Let's see if that is counted in these cases.\n\nThe triple (150,100,50) has a=150, b=100, c=50. Since b=100, it's in case2 (where b=100). So in case2, variables are (a,100,c), with a =100 +d, c=100 -d. Here, a=150 \u21d2 d=50 \u21d2 c=100 -50=50. So yes, this is in case2. So it is counted.\n\nSimilarly, (150,50,100) would be in case3 (c=100). So all valid triples are indeed counted in these cases.\n\nTherefore, the total is 601.\n\nBut wait, let me check the count again.\n\nEach case (A,B,C) has 201 triples. Each case includes the all-100 triple and the edge triples where the fixed variable is 100 and the other two vary such that their sum is 200.\n\nFor case A (a=100), the triples are (100, b, c) where b + c =200, and b and c are nonnegative integers. The number of nonnegative integer solutions to b + c =200 is 201 (from b=0 to 200). So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly for case B and C.\n\nTherefore, each case has 201 triples. The overlaps between any two cases are only the all-100 triple. Thus, the inclusion-exclusion gives 601.\n\nBut wait, the problem states \"nonnegative integers\", so including zero. So the count is correct.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the number of ordered triples. So for example, (100, 200,0) and (200,100,0) are different triples and are both counted separately. Since in case A and case B respectively.\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed 601.\n\nWait, but initially I thought there were 7 solutions, but clearly that was wrong because I missed the cases where variables are different but non-zero. So the correct answer must be 601?\n\nBut let me check the example with (150,100,50). This is one triple, and it's part of case2. Similarly, permutations like (100,50,150) would be in case1 (since a=100). Wait, no:\n\nWait (100,50,150):\n\nThis has a=100, so it's in case1. Here, b=50, so e = b -100 = -50. Then c =100 -e = 150. So yes, it's in case1.\n\nSimilarly, (50,100,150) is in case2 (b=100), and (50,150,100) is in case3 (c=100). Each of these permutations are counted in their respective cases.\n\nTherefore, all permutations where one variable is 100 and the other two sum to 200 are counted, so all permutations are included.\n\nTherefore, the total number is indeed 601. But wait, this seems very high. Let me see:\n\nWait, each of the three cases (a=100, b=100, c=100) each have 201 triples. So total triples are 3*201 = 603, but subtract the duplicates.\n\nEach of the all-100 triple is counted three times, so subtract 2 to count it once. The other overlaps are the edge triples where two variables are 100 and one is 200 or 0. Each of these six triples are counted once in one case each, so no overcounting there. Thus total is 603 - 2 = 601. Yes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601. But wait, let me think again. The problem says \"triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c)\", so ordered triples. So for example, (100, 200,0) and (200, 100,0) are different and both counted. Since in case A and case B respectively, so they are included in the total.\n\nTherefore, the final answer should be 601?\n\nWait, but let me verify with the example:\n\nThe triple (150,100,50) is counted in case2 (since b=100). The triple (100,150,50) is in case1 (a=100). (100,50,150) also in case1. (50,100,150) in case2. (50,150,100) in case3. (150,50,100) in case3. So all permutations are counted, and each is unique.\n\nThe total number of triples where one variable is 100 and the other two add to 200 is, for each position of the 100:\n\nFor a=100: 201 triples (b from 0 to 200, c=200 -b)\n\nSimilarly for b=100 and c=100. So 3*201, but subtract overlaps.\n\nThe overlaps are when two variables are 100, which gives 3 triples (each pair of variables being 100, third 100 or 200? Wait, no. When two variables are 100, the third is 100 as well (since a + b + c=300). Wait, if two variables are 100, then third is 100. So the only triple where two variables are 100 is the all-100 triple.\n\nWait, actually, if two variables are 100, then third is 100, so it's the all-100 triple. So the edge cases where one variable is 200 and another is 0 and the third is 100 are the only ones with two variables not equal to 100. So those are the ones like (200,100,0), etc. Each of those has exactly one variable at 100, one at 200, one at 0.\n\nTherefore, the total number of triples is indeed 3*201 - 2 (for the all-100 counted three times) = 601.\n\nWait, but in the inclusion-exclusion, it's 603 -3 +1=601, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601. But I need to confirm.\n\nWait, but let me think of small cases to verify.\n\nSuppose instead of 300, the total is smaller, say a + b + c = 6, and the equation is something similar. But this might take time.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of another way.\n\nThe number of triples where one of the variables is fixed at 100 is 3*(201) but subtract duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of triples where one variable is exactly 100 is 3*(201 -1) +1. Because for each position (a,b,c), fixing it at 100 gives 201 triples, but the all-100 is counted three times. So total is 3*201 - 2*1 = 603 -2 =601. Yep, that's another way to see it.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the user asks for the number of triples of nonnegative integers (a,b,c) satisfying the two equations. According to our analysis, it's 601. But I need to make sure.\n\nWait, but let me think again about the equation d e (d + e) =0. We assumed that variables are expressed as a =100 +d, etc., but does that substitution cover all possible solutions?\n\nYes, because the substitution was general: we set a =100 +d, b=100 +e, so that c=100 -d -e. So any triple (a,b,c) can be expressed in terms of d and e, so the equation derived must hold for any solution, leading to d e (d + e)=0. So all solutions must satisfy that equation, hence fall into one of the three cases. So the count is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples is 601.\n\nWait, but when I initially found (150,100,50), that's counted in case2, which is okay. So I think the answer is 601.\n\nBut I'm a bit uncertain because 601 seems a large number, but given that the variables can vary quite a bit, perhaps it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the number of solutions when one variable is fixed at 100.\n\nFor example, fix a=100. Then b +c =200. The number of non-negative integer solutions is 201 (from b=0 to 200). Similarly for b=100 and c=100. Thus total is 3*201 =603, but the triple (100,100,100) is counted three times, so subtract 2 to get 601. So that's the same result.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 601.\n\nWait, but the problem is from an Olympiad, perhaps expecting a smaller answer. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution?\n\nWait, let me check the equation again. We had:\n\nAfter substitution, we obtained that d e (d + e)=0, so either d=0,e=0, or d + e=0.\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\nEither d=0 (case1), e=0 (case2), or d +e=0 (case3).\n\nEach of these cases corresponds to one variable being 100. So the triples are those with at least one variable equal to 100. Because:\n\n- In case1 (d=0), a=100.\n\n- In case2 (e=0), b=100.\n\n- In case3 (d + e=0), c=100.\n\nTherefore, all solutions must have at least one of the variables equal to 100. Therefore, the total number of solutions is equal to the number of triples with at least one variable equal to 100, and satisfying the original equations.\n\nWait, but the original equations must also be satisfied. However, by the derivation, all triples with at least one variable equal to 100 automatically satisfy the second equation?\n\nWait, let me confirm.\n\nSuppose a=100, then b +c =200. Then, let's compute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b.\n\nWith a=100:\n\n= 100\u00b2b + 100\u00b2c + b\u00b2*100 + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2*100 + c\u00b2b\n\n= 100\u00b2(b +c) + 100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc(b +c)\n\nSince b +c =200:\n\n= 100\u00b2*200 + 100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) + bc*200\n\nCompute each term:\n\n100\u00b2 *200 = 10,000 *200 = 2,000,000\n\n100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) = 100*(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2)\n\n200 bc\n\nThus total expression is:\n\n2,000,000 + 100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +200 bc\n\nBut we need this to be 6,000,000. So:\n\n2,000,000 + 100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +200 bc =6,000,000\n\nSubtract 2,000,000:\n\n100(b\u00b2 +c\u00b2) +200 bc =4,000,000\n\nDivide both sides by 100:\n\nb\u00b2 +c\u00b2 + 2 bc =40,000\n\nBut b +c =200, so (b +c)^2 =40,000 = b\u00b2 +2 bc +c\u00b2.\n\nThus, the equation reduces to (b +c)^2 =40,000, which is exactly satisfied because b +c =200 \u21d2 200\u00b2=40,000. So yes, any triple with a=100 and b +c =200 automatically satisfies the second equation. Similarly for the other cases.\n\nTherefore, all triples with at least one variable equal to 100 automatically satisfy the second equation, provided they satisfy the first equation. Therefore, the count is indeed the number of triples with at least one variable equal to 100, which is 3*201 - 3*1 +1=601.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 601.\n\nBut I need to ensure that there are no other solutions where none of the variables is 100. But according to the equation derived earlier, d e (d + e)=0 requires that either d=0,e=0, or d +e=0, so at least one of a,b,c must be 100. Thus, there are no other solutions.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 601.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"nonnegative integers\", so including zero. So this is correct.\n\nHowever, I recall that when I first considered the case where one variable is zero, like (200,100,0), that is included in this count, and there are six such permutations. So all is well.\n\nTherefore, the number is 601.\n\nBut now I'm confused because in the initial analysis, I thought maybe 7 solutions, but clearly that was wrong. So I think 601 is correct. However, maybe the question counts ordered triples, so the answer is 601. But maybe I made a miscalculation in the inclusion-exclusion.\n\nWait, let me compute again:\n\nNumber of triples with a=100: 201\n\nSimilarly for b=100:201\n\nSimilarly for c=100:201\n\nTotal: 3*201 =603\n\nSubtract the overlaps where two variables are 100:\n\nEach pair (a and b both 100 \u21d2 c=100), so there are 3 such triples (each pair), but they all result in the triple (100,100,100). So subtract 2 (because we've counted this triple three times, so need to subtract 2 to leave one).\n\nThus total is 603 - 2 =601.\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 601.\n\nBut wait, the problem is from an Olympiad, maybe the answer is different? Maybe I made a mistake in the equation.\n\nWait let me check with another example. Let me pick a triple where a=150, b=50, c=100. Then:\n\nCompute the second equation:\n\na\u00b2b + a\u00b2c + b\u00b2a + b\u00b2c + c\u00b2a + c\u00b2b\n\n= 150\u00b2*50 + 150\u00b2*100 + 50\u00b2*150 + 50\u00b2*100 + 100\u00b2*150 + 100\u00b2*50\n\nCompute each term:\n\n150\u00b2*50 = 22500 *50 =1,125,000\n\n150\u00b2*100 =22500*100=2,250,000\n\n50\u00b2*150 =2500*150=375,000\n\n50\u00b2*100=2500*100=250,000\n\n100\u00b2*150=10,000*150=1,500,000\n\n100\u00b2*50=10,000*50=500,000\n\nSumming all terms:\n\n1,125,000 +2,250,000 =3,375,000\n\n+375,000 =3,750,000\n\n+250,000 =4,000,000\n\n+1,500,000 =5,500,000\n\n+500,000 =6,000,000. Correct.\n\nThus, this triple is valid and counted in the cases.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{601}\n\n\nTo find the number of triples of nonnegative integers \\((a, b, c)\\) satisfying \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and \\(a^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = 6,000,000\\), we start by rewriting the second equation using algebraic manipulation.\n\nThe given equation can be rewritten as:\n\\[\na^2(b + c) + b^2(a + c) + c^2(a + b) = 6,000,000\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(b + c = 300 - a\\), \\(a + c = 300 - b\\), and \\(a + b = 300 - c\\), we get:\n\\[\na^2(300 - a) + b^2(300 - b) + c^2(300 - c) = 6,000,000\n\\]\nThis can be further simplified using the identity:\n\\[\na^2b + a^2c + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b = (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(a + b + c = 300\\), we get:\n\\[\n300(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc = 6,000,000\n\\]\nDividing by 3:\n\\[\n100(ab + bc + ca) - abc = 2,000,000\n\\]\n\nWe denote \\(S = a + b + c = 300\\), \\(Q = ab + bc + ca\\), and \\(P = abc\\). The equation becomes:\n\\[\n100Q - P = 2,000,000\n\\]\n\nWe then consider the substitution \\(a = 100 + d\\), \\(b = 100 + e\\), and \\(c = 100 - d - e\\). This leads to the equation:\n\\[\nd e (d + e) = 0\n\\]\nThis implies that either \\(d = 0\\), \\(e = 0\\), or \\(d + e = 0\\). These cases correspond to one of the variables being 100. \n\nEach case (where one variable is fixed at 100) results in 201 solutions (since the other two variables must sum to 200). However, the triple \\((100, 100, 100)\\) is counted three times, so we subtract 2 to correct the overcount. \n\nThe total number of solutions is calculated as:\n\\[\n3 \\times 201 - 2 = 601\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of triples \\((a, b, c)\\) is \\(\\boxed{601}\\).",
