      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is first. \n\nThe problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits when written in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. \n\nAlright, so first, let's parse the requirements for a number n to be b-eautiful:\n\n1. It must have exactly two digits in base b. That means n is between b^1 (which is b) and b^2 - 1. Because in base b, the first two-digit number is 10_b (which is b in decimal) and the last two-digit number is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 -1. \n\n2. The sum of its two digits in base b must equal the square root of n. Let me denote the two digits as d1 and d0 (where d1 is the first digit, so it can't be zero). So, d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). \n\nSince n is a two-digit number in base b, we can write n as d1 * b + d0. \n\nSo putting these together, the equation we have is:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(n) = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)\n\nSo, we need to find all pairs (d1, d0) where d1 is from 1 to b-1, and d0 from 0 to b-1, such that d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0). \n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such pairs (d1, d0) exceeds 10. \n\nHmm, okay. Let me formalize this equation. Let me denote S = d1 + d0, which is supposed to be equal to sqrt(n). Since n = d1*b + d0, then S = sqrt(d1*b + d0). Squaring both sides, we get:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nBut since S = d1 + d0, substitute S:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a better way to handle this. Let me try to express in terms of d1 and d0. Let's see:\n\nWe have (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation as:\n\nd1*b = (d1 + d0)^2 - d0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express d0 in terms of d1 and S. Wait, S is d1 + d0, so d0 = S - d1. Substitute that into the equation S^2 = d1*b + d0:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + (S - d1) \n\nSo, S^2 = d1*(b - 1) + S \n\nThen, moving terms around:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S \n\nTherefore,\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, this seems more manageable. Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1 (since it's the first digit in base b), the right-hand side must be an integer, and d1 must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1. Similarly, since d0 = S - d1 must also be between 0 and b-1 (since it's a digit in base b). So, we can use this equation to find possible S values for a given b, then check the constraints on d1 and d0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible S, we can find the possible b's where this holds. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, note that S must be an integer because sqrt(n) must be an integer (since the sum of two integers is an integer, so sqrt(n) must be integer). Therefore, n must be a perfect square, and S must be the square root of n. So, S is an integer, and n = S^2. \n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + d0, and S = d1 + d0. \n\nSo, substituting d0 = S - d1 into the first equation:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + (S - d1)\n\n=> S^2 = d1*(b - 1) + S\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S\n\nTherefore,\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer, (S^2 - S) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, since d1 must be between 1 and b-1, inclusive, we can write:\n\n1 \u2264 (S^2 - S)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n\nTherefore,\n\n1 \u2264 (S(S - 1))/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n\nLet me denote that as:\n\n(S(S - 1))/(b - 1) \u2265 1 and \u2264 b -1\n\nSo,\n\nS(S - 1) \u2265 (b - 1) and S(S - 1) \u2264 (b - 1)^2\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, we can find all possible S such that (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b-1), and then check if the resulting d1 and d0 are valid digits (i.e., d1 between 1 and b-1, d0 between 0 and b-1, and d0 = S - d1). \n\nAlternatively, since n = S^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b and b^2 -1. Therefore, S^2 must be in [b, b^2 -1]. Since S is sqrt(n), so S must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 -1). Since sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so S is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]. Because S must be an integer. \n\nWait, sqrt(n) must be at least sqrt(b), since n is at least b. So S \u2265 sqrt(b). But S must also be an integer. So S can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1? Wait, but n can be as big as b^2 -1, so sqrt(n) can be as big as sqrt(b^2 -1) \u2248 b, so S can be up to b -1 (since sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so the maximum integer S is b -1). \n\nTherefore, S ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo for each b, we can consider S in that range, and check whether (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b -1). If so, then compute d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1). Then check if d1 is between 1 and b-1, and then check if d0 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1. \n\nAlternatively, since once d1 is computed, d0 is determined as S - d1, so we just need to check that d0 is between 0 and b-1. \n\nWait, but d0 must also be a non-negative integer. Since d0 = S - d1, and d1 is at least 1, so S - d1 must be at least 0. So S \u2265 d1. But since d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1), so substituting that in, we need S \u2265 (S^2 - S)/(b -1). \n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to think of another approach. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, for a given b, let me consider all possible two-digit numbers in base b. Each such number is n = d1*b + d0, with 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1. The condition is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). Therefore, sqrt(n) must be an integer, so n must be a perfect square. Let me denote S = sqrt(n). Then n = S^2, so S must satisfy S = d1 + d0, and S^2 = d1*b + d0. \n\nTherefore, substituting d0 = S - d1 into the second equation:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + (S - d1) => S^2 = d1*(b -1) + S \n\nTherefore,\n\nd1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S \n\nSo,\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, the numerator must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be within that range. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-beautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers S such that:\n\n1. S^2 is a two-digit number in base b (i.e., b \u2264 S^2 \u2264 b^2 -1)\n\n2. (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b -1)\n\n3. The resulting d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1) must be an integer between 1 and b-1\n\n4. Then d0 = S - d1 must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, we can iterate over possible S values, check these conditions, and count the number of valid (d1, d0) pairs. \n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10. \n\nHmm. Since this might be tedious to do manually for all b, maybe there is a pattern or formula here. Let me see if I can find a way to express the number of solutions for a given b in terms of S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express S in terms of b. Let me see:\n\nStarting from d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer, so (S\u00b2 - S) must be divisible by (b -1). Let me denote (b -1) divides (S\u00b2 - S). So, (S\u00b2 - S) mod (b -1) = 0. \n\nTherefore, (S\u00b2 - S) \u2261 0 mod (b -1). \n\nSo, S(S -1) \u2261 0 mod (b -1). \n\nTherefore, the product of two consecutive integers S and S-1 must be divisible by (b -1). Since S and S-1 are coprime (consecutive integers), this implies that (b -1) must divide the product S(S -1). \n\nHence, (b -1) must be a factor of S(S -1). Since S and S-1 are coprime, the factors of (b -1) must be distributed between S and S-1. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the possible S's are those integers where (b -1) divides S(S -1). \n\nMoreover, S must be such that S^2 is in the range [b, b^2 -1], so S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)). Since sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so S can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1. \n\nSo for each b, the number of solutions is the number of integers S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b -1) divides S(S -1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can rephrase this as:\n\nLet k = b -1. Then, we need to find the number of S in [ceil(sqrt(k +1)), k] such that k divides S(S -1). \n\nHmm, perhaps this substitution could help. Let me try.\n\nLet me set k = b -1, so b = k +1. Then S ranges from ceil(sqrt(k+1)) up to k. \n\nWe need S(S -1) \u2261 0 mod k. \n\nSo, for each k (where k = b -1 \u22651 since b \u22652), the number of S in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that S(S -1) \u22610 mod k. \n\nWe need to find the smallest k +1 (since b = k+1) such that the number of such S exceeds 10. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal k where the count is >10, then adding 1 to get b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of possible values of k (starting from small k) and compute the number of S for each. \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, maybe we can look for when the number of divisors or factors of k allows for more solutions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of S and S-1 as numbers such that one of them is divisible by k, or their factors multiply to cover k. Since S and S-1 are coprime, so if k divides S(S -1), then k must divide either S or S-1, or be split between them. \n\nWait, since S and S-1 are coprime, any prime factor of k must divide either S or S-1, but not both. Therefore, the factors of k can be partitioned between S and S-1. \n\nTherefore, the equation S(S -1) \u22610 mod k implies that k divides S(S-1). Since gcd(S, S-1)=1, then k must divide either S or S-1. Wait, actually, not necessarily. Wait, if k divides S(S-1), and gcd(S, S-1)=1, then k must divide S or k divides S-1? Not exactly. For example, suppose k is a product of two coprime numbers, say a and b, where a divides S and b divides S-1. Since a and b are coprime, then k divides S(S-1). \n\nSo, in general, k can be written as a product of factors where one factor divides S and another divides S-1, but since they are coprime, the factors must be coprime. \n\nThis is getting a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to think numerically. Let me try to compute the number of S for some b and see when it crosses 10. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me see:\n\nWe have d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1). Since d1 must be between 1 and b-1, then (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1. So S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2. \n\nAlso, since d1 must be at least 1, (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u22651 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S \u2265 (b -1). \n\nTherefore, for each S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], we can check if S\u00b2 - S is divisible by (b -1). \n\nAlternatively, rearranged:\n\nLet me consider that for each S, (S\u00b2 - S) must be divisible by (b-1). So (b-1) divides (S(S -1)). \n\nTherefore, for a given S, possible (b-1) must be a divisor of S(S -1). So for each S, the possible values of (b-1) are the divisors of S(S -1). Therefore, if we fix S, then (b-1) can be any divisor of S(S-1), and then b = (divisor) +1. \n\nBut since we want to count for each b the number of S such that (b-1) divides S(S -1) and S is in the required range, perhaps this is more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parameterize in terms of S. Let me see.\n\nSuppose for a given S, the number of b's for which b-1 divides S(S-1) and b is in the range where S is within [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]. Hmm, maybe not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each S, the possible b's are such that b-1 divides S(S-1), and b is between S^2/(b^2) ??? Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's try to consider that for each S, the possible b's are divisors of S(S-1) plus 1, but constrained so that S is within the required range for b. \n\nThis seems too vague. Let me instead think of an example. Let's try small values of b and see how many b-eautiful numbers there are, then look for when it exceeds 10. \n\nStarting with b=2:\n\nFor b=2, two-digit numbers in base 2 are from 2 (10_2) up to 3 (11_2). So n can be 2 or 3.\n\nCheck each:\n\nFor n=2: digits are 1 and 0. Sum is 1+0=1. sqrt(2)\u22481.414, not integer. Not beautiful.\n\nFor n=3: digits 1 and 1. Sum is 2. sqrt(3)\u22481.732, not integer. Not beautiful.\n\nSo, 0 b-beautiful numbers for b=2.\n\nb=3:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base3: from 3 (10_3) to 8 (22_3).\n\nPossible n must be perfect squares. The squares in this range are 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2) but 9 is 100_3 which is three digits, so only 4.\n\nCheck n=4:\n\n4 in base3 is 11_3. Digits 1 and 1. Sum is 2. sqrt(4)=2. So 2=2. So yes, it's 3-eautiful. \n\nSo count is 1.\n\nb=4:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base4: 4 (10_4) to 15 (33_4).\n\nSquares in this range: 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2) which is 100_4 (three digits). So 4, 9.\n\nCheck n=4: 10_4. Digits 1 and 0. Sum 1. sqrt(4)=2. Not equal. Not beautiful.\n\nn=9: 21_4. Digits 2 and1. Sum 3. sqrt(9)=3. So yes. \n\nAnother square is 16 but it's three digits. So only 9. Count is 1.\n\nHmm, same as before. \n\nb=5:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base5: 5 to 24.\n\nSquares in range: 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), 25 (5^2) which is three digits. So 9, 16.\n\nCheck n=9: 14_5 (1*5 +4=9). Sum 1+4=5. sqrt(9)=3. Not equal. \n\nWait, that can't be. Wait 14_5 is 1*5 +4 =9, so digits 1 and4. Their sum is 5, which is not 3. So not beautiful.\n\nn=16: 31_5 (3*5 +1=16). Sum is 3+1=4. sqrt(16)=4. So yes. \n\nSo count is 1.\n\nHmm, still 1. \n\nb=6:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base6: 6-35.\n\nSquares: 9, 16, 25, 36 (but 36 is 100_6). So up to 25.\n\nCheck each square:\n\nn=9: 13_6 (1*6+3=9). Sum 1+3=4 vs sqrt(9)=3. No.\n\nn=16: 24_6 (2*6+4=16). Sum 2+4=6 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.\n\nn=25: 41_6 (4*6 +1=25). Sum 4+1=5 vs sqrt(25)=5. Yes. So count=1.\n\nb=7:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from 7 to 48.\n\nSquares: 9,16,25,36,49 (but 49 is 100_7, so up to 36).\n\nCheck n=9: 12_7 (1*7+2=9). Sum 1+2=3 vs sqrt(9)=3. Yes.\n\nn=16: 22_7 (2*7+2=16). Sum 2+2=4 vs sqrt(16)=4. Yes.\n\nn=25: 34_7 (3*7 +4=25). Sum 3+4=7 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.\n\nn=36: 51_7 (5*7+1=36). Sum 5+1=6 vs sqrt(36)=6. Yes.\n\nSo total here: 3 (n=9,16,36). So count=3.\n\nOkay, so for b=7, there are 3 b-eautiful numbers. \n\nContinuing, maybe this is going to take a while, but perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a formula or a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the equation:\n\nWe have d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1). Since d1 must be between 1 and b-1, so:\n\n1 \u2264 (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nMultiply all terms by (b -1):\n\n(b -1) \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me consider the left inequality first:\n\nS\u00b2 - S \u2265 (b -1)\n\nThe right inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me rearrange both inequalities.\n\nLeft inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 - S - (b -1) \u22650 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - b +1 \u22650.\n\nRight inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 - S - (b -1)^2 \u22640 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - (b\u00b2 - 2b +1) \u22640 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - b\u00b2 + 2b -1 \u22640.\n\nHmm. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express b in terms of S. Let me see:\n\nFrom the equation d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1), and since d1 must be \u2264 b-1,\n\n(S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - (b -1)^2 \u22640.\n\nBut solving for b here might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of S and see for each S, possible b's. Let me consider that for a given S, the possible b's must satisfy that (b -1) divides S(S -1). Also, since n = S\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which requires that b \u2264 S\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1. \n\nTherefore, b must satisfy b \u2264 S\u00b2 and S\u00b2 < b\u00b2. \n\nSo sqrt(S\u00b2) = S < b \u2264 S\u00b2. Therefore, b must be in (S, S\u00b2]. Wait, but since b has to be an integer greater than S, so b must be from S+1 to S\u00b2. \n\nWait, but since n = S\u00b2 must be two-digit in base b, so n < b\u00b2. Since n = S\u00b2, that gives S\u00b2 < b\u00b2 \u2192 b > S. So the range for b is S+1 \u2264 b \u2264 S\u00b2. \n\nBut also, since the two-digit number in base b must be at least b, so S\u00b2 \u2265 b. \n\nTherefore, combining these, for a given S, the possible b's are integers from max(S+1, ...) up to S\u00b2, but also such that (b -1) divides S(S -1). \n\nThis seems a bit involved, but maybe we can think of for each S, the possible b's are divisors of S(S-1) plus 1, lying in the interval (S, S\u00b2].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each S, the number of b's is equal to the number of divisors of S(S-1) that are in (S, S\u00b2], then adding 1? Not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of trying to find the count for each b, let's see for each S, how many b's can be formed such that (b-1) divides S(S-1) and b is in (S, S\u00b2]. Then, for each b, the number of S's would be the number of S's for which b-1 divides S(S-1) and S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. \n\nThis seems too tangled. Maybe going back to the original approach of trying to compute counts for increasing b until we reach over 10. \n\nLet me try to proceed step by step for each b. Let's see.\n\nContinuing from where I left off:\n\nb=7 had 3 numbers. Let me try b=8:\n\nb=8:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base8: 8 to 63.\n\nSquares in that range: 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64 (but 64 is 100_8, so up to 49).\n\nCheck each square:\n\nn=9: 11_8 (1+1=2 vs sqrt(9)=3). No.\n\nn=16: 20_8 (2+0=2 vs 4). No.\n\nn=25: 31_8 (3+1=4 vs 5). No.\n\nn=36: 44_8 (4+4=8 vs 6). No.\n\nn=49: 61_8 (6+1=7 vs 7). Yes. So only 49. So count=1?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, let me check each:\n\nWait, n=9: 11_8 is 1*8+1=9. Sum is 2, which is not 3. Not.\n\nn=16: 20_8 (2*8 +0=16). Sum is 2, but sqrt(16)=4. Not.\n\nn=25: 31_8 (3*8 +1=25). Sum 4 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.\n\nn=36: 44_8 (4*8+4=36). Sum 8 vs sqrt(36)=6. Not.\n\nn=49: 61_8 (6*8+1=49). Sum 7 vs sqrt(49)=7. Yes. \n\nSo only one. So total is 1? Hmm, but in base8, 49 is valid. Wait, so total is 1. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed another square?\n\nWait 64 is excluded, so 49 is the last. So yes, only 49. So count=1.\n\nHmm, so b=7 had 3, b=8 has 1. \n\nContinuing.\n\nb=9:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base9: 9 to 80.\n\nSquares in range: 9,16,25,36,49,64,81 (but 81 is 100_9, so up to 64).\n\nCheck each:\n\nn=9: 10_9 (1+0=1 vs 3). No.\n\nn=16: 17_9 (1+7=8 vs 4). No.\n\nn=25: 27_9 (2+7=9 vs 5). No.\n\nn=36: 40_9 (4+0=4 vs 6). No.\n\nn=49: 54_9 (5+4=9 vs7). No.\n\nn=64: 71_9 (7+1=8 vs8). 7+1=8, sqrt(64)=8. Yes. So 64 is valid. \n\nSo count=1.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nb=10:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base10: 10 to 99.\n\nSquares in this range: 16,25,..., 100 (but 100 is three digits, so up to 81, 100 excluded).\n\nWait, squares from 4^2=16 up to 9^2=81, and 10^2=100 excluded.\n\nSo squares: 16,25,36,49,64,81.\n\nCheck each:\n\nn=16: 16 in base10 is 16, which is two digits. The digits sum 1+6=7 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.\n\nWait, digits are 1 and 6? Wait in base10, 16 is '1' and '6', sum 7. Not equal to 4. \n\nn=25: digits 2+5=7 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.\n\nn=36: 3+6=9 vs6. No.\n\nn=49: 4+9=13 vs7. No.\n\nn=64: 6+4=10 vs8. No.\n\nn=81: 8+1=9 vs9. Yes. \n\nSo only 81. So count=1.\n\nHmm, so b=10:1.\n\nHmm, not increasing yet. \n\nWait, maybe higher b?\n\nLet me try b=13 as in the example:\n\nb=13:\n\nThe example says 81 is 13-beautiful. Let me check:\n\n81 in base13: 6*13 +3=78+3=81. So digits 6 and3. Sum 9, sqrt(81)=9. Correct. \n\nOther squares:\n\nLet me see the squares between 13 and 13^2 -1=168. So squares up to 12^2=144, 13^2=169 excluded.\n\nSo squares: 16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144.\n\nCheck each:\n\nn=16: 13: 16 in base13 is 13+3=1*13 +3 \u2192 digits 1 and3. Sum 4 vs sqrt(16)=4. Yes! So 16 is also beautiful here.\n\nWait, so let me check:\n\n16: base13 is 13 + 3? Wait 1*13 +3 =16, yes. So digits 1 and3. 1+3=4, which is sqrt(16)=4. So yes. So that's another one.\n\nn=25: in base13 is 1C (since 1*13 +12=25). But digits are 1 and 12 (which is 'C'). The sum is 1+12=13 vs sqrt(25)=5. Not. \n\nWait, but digits must be numbers, so in base13, digits go from 0-12. So 25 is 1 and 12 (since 1*13 +12=25). Sum is 13, not 5. \n\nn=36: in base13: 2*13 +10=26+10=36. So digits 2 and10. Sum 12 vs sqrt(36)=6. Not.\n\nn=49: 3*13 + 10=39+10=49. Wait, 3*13=39, so 49-39=10. So digits 3 and10. Sum 13 vs7. No.\n\nAlternatively, 49 in base13: 3*13 +10=49, yes. Sum 13 vs7. No.\n\nn=64: 4*13 +12=52 +12=64. So digits 4 and12. Sum 16 vs8. 16 vs8. Not.\n\nn=81: 6*13 +3=81. As in the example. Sum 9 vs9. Yes.\n\nn=100: 7*13 +9=91+9=100. Digits 7 and9. Sum16 vs10. Not.\n\nn=121: 9*13 +4=117+4=121. Sum9+4=13 vs11. Not.\n\nn=144: 11*13 +1=143+1=144. Sum11+1=12 vs12. Wait sqrt(144)=12. So digits 11 and1. Sum 12. So yes! \n\nSo 144 is also beautiful here. \n\nSo total for b=13: \n\n16 (digits 1+3=4), 81 (6+3=9), 144 (11+1=12). Wait, sqrt(144)=12, so yes. \n\nWait, are there more?\n\nLet me check n=25, 36, etc. \n\nWait let me recount:\n\n16: yes.\n\n25: no.\n\n36: no.\n\n49: no.\n\n64: no.\n\n81: yes.\n\n100: no.\n\n121: no.\n\n144: yes.\n\nWait, what about n= 49: 3+10=13 vs7. Not. \n\nWait, n= 121: 9 +4=13 vs11. Not. \n\nWait, 144: 11+1=12. sqrt(144)=12. Yes. \n\nSo total three numbers: 16,81,144. So count=3. But the example says 81 is one of them, so that's correct. \n\nWait, but maybe I missed others?\n\nWait let's check n= 25: no. What about n= 100? 7+9=16 vs10. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let's check n= 121: 9 and 4 gives 13 vs11. \n\nWait, is there another square? Let's see:\n\nWait 10^2=100, 11^2=121, 12^2=144. \n\nWait what about 1^2=1? Not two digits in base13. 2^2=4, same. Up to 3^2=9, still single digit. So only from 4^2=16 up. \n\nSo 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121,144. \n\nSo only three of them qualify. So count is 3. \n\nHmm, but the example mentions 81 as an example, so that's correct. \n\nHmm, so moving on. Maybe check higher b's. Let me try b=16:\n\nb=16:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base16 (hex) go from 16 (10) to 255 (FF).\n\nSquares up to 255: sqrt(255)\u224815.99, so squares up to 15\u00b2=225, 16\u00b2=256 excluded.\n\nSo squares from 4\u00b2=16 up to 15\u00b2=225.\n\nCheck each square:\n\nn=16: in base16 is 10. Digits 1 and0. Sum1 vs4. No.\n\nn=25: 19 (1*16 +9=25). Sum1+9=10 vs5. No.\n\nn=36: 24 (2*16 +4=36). Sum6 vs6. Wait 2+4=6. sqrt(36)=6. So yes.\n\nn=49: 31 (3*16+1=49). Sum4 vs7. 3+1=4 vs7. No.\n\nn=64: 40 (4*16+0=64). Sum4 vs8. No.\n\nn=81: 51 (5*16 +1=81). 5+1=6 vs9. No.\n\nn=100: 64 (6*16 +4=100). 6+4=10 vs10. sqrt(100)=10. So yes.\n\nn=121: 79 (7*16 +9=121). 7+9=16 vs11. No.\n\nn=144: 90 (9*16 +0=144). 9+0=9 vs12. No.\n\nn=169: A9 (10*16 +9=169). 10+9=19 vs13. No.\n\nWait, 13\u00b2=169. So digits A (10) and 9. Sum 19 vs13. No.\n\nn=196: C4 (12*16 +4=196). 12+4=16 vs14. No.\n\nn=225: E1 (14*16 +1=225). 14+1=15 vs15. sqrt(225)=15. So yes.\n\nSo the valid ones are:\n\n36 (24), 100 (64), 225 (E1). \n\nWait 36 is 24 in hex: digits 2 and4. Sum 6, sqrt(36)=6. \n\n100 in hex is 64 (digits 6 and4?), no wait 64 in decimal is 40 in hex. Wait no:\n\nWait n=100 decimal is 64 in hex? Wait no:\n\nWait 6*16 +4 = 100? 6*16=96 +4=100. Yes. So digits 6 and4. Sum 10, sqrt(100)=10. So yes.\n\nn=225 decimal is E1 in hex (14*16 +1=224+1=225). So digits 14 and1. Sum 15, sqrt(225)=15. So yes. \n\nThus total three numbers here. Hmm, so count=3 for b=16.\n\nHmm, not increasing. \n\nWait, maybe b=25? Let me try b=25.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Maybe we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, let me think again of the equation:\n\nd1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, so:\n\n1 \u2264 (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n(b -1) \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me denote k = b -1, so:\n\nk \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 k\u00b2\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 - S \u2265 k \u2192 S\u00b2 - S -k \u22650,\n\nand S\u00b2 - S -k\u00b2 \u22640 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2.\n\nSo for given k, we can find S such that sqrt(k) \u2248 S, since S must be around sqrt(n)=sqrt(S\u00b2)=S, but n is in base b which is k+1. \n\nWait, perhaps S is roughly between sqrt(b) and b?\n\nAlternatively, the inequalities can be written as:\n\nS\u00b2 - S -k \u22650 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S \u2265k,\n\nand S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2.\n\nSo the value of S must satisfy both inequalities. Let me try to find S in terms of k.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that S is a variable and k is also a variable, and we need to find pairs (S, k) such that k is between S\u00b2 - S and (S\u00b2 - S)/1 (since k \u2264 S\u00b2 - S). Wait, no, the first inequality is k \u2264 S\u00b2 - S, and the second is S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2. So combining:\n\nk \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, for each S, k must be between sqrt(S\u00b2 - S) and S\u00b2 - S. Wait, perhaps this is better approached numerically.\n\nAlternatively, for a given S, the possible k (which is b-1) must satisfy k \u2264 S\u00b2 - S and k\u00b2 \u2265 S\u00b2 - S.\n\nSo k is between ceiling( sqrt(S\u00b2 - S) ) and S\u00b2 - S.\n\nWait, but also, since b must be greater than S (since n = S\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so b must be less than S\u00b2, but actually b must be greater than S because n = S\u00b2 must be at least b (since it's a two-digit number). So S\u00b2 \u2265 b \u2192 b \u2264 S\u00b2, but b must also be greater than S (since two-digit number requires b \u2264 n < b\u00b2). Wait, the two-digit number requires that b \u2264 n < b\u00b2. Since n = S\u00b2, so:\n\nb \u2264 S\u00b2 < b\u00b2 \u2192 sqrt(b) \u2264 S < b.\n\nTherefore, S must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nBut since b =k+1, then S must be in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k].\n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled again. Maybe let me think of S and k such that:\n\nk divides S(S-1),\n\nand k is between S and S\u00b2 - S (from the inequalities above). Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for each S, the possible k (b-1) must divide S(S-1), and k must be between S and S\u00b2 (since b must be between S+1 and S\u00b2). \n\nWait, since k = b-1, so b =k +1 must satisfy S+1 \u2264k+1 \u2264 S\u00b2 \u2192 S \u2264k \u2264 S\u00b2 -1.\n\nTherefore, k must be between S and S\u00b2 -1.\n\nThus, for a given S, the number of valid k (i.e., b-1) is equal to the number of divisors of S(S-1) that lie between S and S\u00b2 -1, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the total number of b's for which there exists an S such that b-1 divides S(S-1), and b is in (S, S\u00b2], and S is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nBut this seems too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is equal to the number of S such that S(S-1) is divisible by (b-1), and S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the count is the number of integers S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where (b-1) divides S(S-1). \n\nTherefore, perhaps to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, we need to find when the number of divisors of (b-1) in a certain range allows for more than 10 solutions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of b-1 as a number that has many factors, so that there are many S such that S(S-1) is divisible by (b-1). \n\nFor example, if b-1 is a highly composite number, then perhaps there are more S values. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of choosing b-1 to be 12, which has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12. Maybe testing b=13 (as before) gives 3 numbers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps when b-1 is a factorial or something? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of S(S-1) must be divisible by (b-1). Since S and S-1 are coprime, then (b-1) must divide the product S(S-1), so (b-1) must be a factor that can be split between S and S-1. \n\nSuppose (b-1) divides S(S-1). Let me consider that (b-1) is equal to d1*d2, where d1 divides S and d2 divides (S-1), with gcd(d1,d2)=1. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions S for a given b-1 is equal to the number of ways to factor b-1 into two coprime factors d1 and d2, such that d1 divides S and d2 divides (S-1), and then S must satisfy certain congruence conditions. \n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps for each factorization of (b-1) into d1*d2 where gcd(d1,d2)=1, there is a unique S modulo (b-1) that satisfies S \u22610 mod d1 and S \u22611 mod d2. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions S in [1, b-1] is equal to the number of such factorizations. But we need S to be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]. \n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions would be roughly the number of coprime factor pairs of (b-1). \n\nHence, if (b-1) has many coprime factor pairs, then the count would be higher. \n\nTherefore, to have more than 10 solutions, we need (b-1) to have more than 10 coprime factor pairs. \n\nThe number of coprime factor pairs of a number n is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of n. Because each prime can be assigned to either d1 or d2, but since d1 and d2 must be coprime, each prime factor must go entirely to one or the other. \n\nWait, actually, the number of ways to split the prime factors into two coprime factors (d1,d2) with d1*d2 = n is 2^{number of prime factors of n}. Because for each prime, you decide whether it goes to d1 or d2. However, since (d1,d2) and (d2,d1) are considered the same if order doesn't matter, but in our case, since d1 divides S and d2 divides (S-1), the order matters because S mod d1 is 0 and S mod d2 is1. \n\nTherefore, each coprime pair (d1,d2) with d1*d2 =n gives a unique solution S modulo n. So the number of solutions S in [1, n] is exactly the number of coprime factorizations of n into d1*d2. Since each coprime pair gives a unique solution. \n\nThus, the number of solutions S in [1, n] is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of n. However, since d1 and d2 can be swapped (since (d1,d2) and (d2,d1) are different factorizations but lead to different congruence conditions), but actually, if we consider ordered pairs, then it's 2^{k}. But since d1 and d2 are ordered (since d1 divides S and d2 divides S-1), so each coprime pair (d1,d2) where d1*d2 =n gives a unique solution. \n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions S mod n is equal to the number of coprime ordered pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2 =n. Which is indeed 2^{k}, since for each prime, you choose whether it goes to d1 or d2. \n\nHowever, each such pair gives a unique solution S modulo n. Therefore, in the range [1, n], there are exactly 2^{k} solutions. \n\nBut in our problem, we are only interested in S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] (since S must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 S < b). \n\nTherefore, the total number of valid S is equal to the number of solutions S in that interval. \n\nSince the total number of solutions modulo n is 2^{k}, but spread out over the interval, perhaps roughly half of them would be in the upper half (since S needs to be up to b-1). \n\nWait, but if n = b-1, then the solutions S are spread across 0 to n. So the total number is 2^{k}. So to have more than 10 solutions, we need 2^{k} > 20 (since half might be in the required interval). \n\nWait, perhaps this is getting somewhere. \n\nSuppose n = b-1 has k distinct prime factors, then the number of coprime factorizations is 2^{k}. Each such factorization corresponds to a solution S in [1, n]. \n\nBut we need S to be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), n]. Since b =n+1, so sqrt(b) \u2248 sqrt(n+1). \n\nThe interval [ceil(sqrt(n+1)), n] is roughly from sqrt(n) to n. The total number of solutions is 2^{k}. \n\nTherefore, if 2^{k} exceeds 2*10=20, then maybe half would be in the required interval. \n\nWait, but maybe not exactly half. \n\nAlternatively, if n is large enough, the number of solutions in the interval might be approximately half of 2^{k}. \n\nTherefore, to have more than 10 solutions, we need 2^{k} > 20 \u2192 k \u22655 (since 2^4=16 <20, 2^5=32>20). \n\nTherefore, if n has at least 5 distinct prime factors, then the number of solutions could be over 10. \n\nTherefore, the minimal n (which is b-1) with at least 5 distinct prime factors would be the product of first 5 primes: 2*3*5*7*11=2310. But that's way too big. \n\nAlternatively, maybe n can have exponents on primes but still have 5 distinct primes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps even with fewer prime factors but some exponents, the number of coprime factor pairs can be higher? Wait no, the number of coprime factor pairs only depends on the number of distinct primes. Because for coprime factors, each prime must be entirely in one factor or the other, so the number of coprime ordered factorizations is indeed 2^k where k is the number of distinct primes. \n\nTherefore, to have 2^{k} > 20, we need k \u22655. \n\nTherefore, the minimal n (b-1) with 5 distinct prime factors is 2*3*5*7*11=2310, so b=2311. But that's way too big. The example with b=13 (n=12) has k=2 (primes 2 and3), so 2^2=4 solutions, but in reality we only found 3 solutions. Hmm, discrepancy here. \n\nWait, let me check with b=13 (n=12). The number of coprime factorizations of 12 into d1*d2 where gcd(d1,d2)=1. \n\nThe prime factors of 12 are 2^2*3. So the distinct primes are 2 and3. Thus, k=2. So number of coprime ordered factorizations is 2^2=4. \n\nIndeed:\n\nThe coprime factorizations of 12 into d1*d2 with gcd(d1,d2)=1:\n\nPossible assignments of primes:\n\n- 2 and3 can be assigned to d1 or d2.\n\nPossible options:\n\n1. Assign 2 to d1 and 3 to d2. Then d1 must be a multiple of 2 but not 3, and d2 must be a multiple of 3 but not 2. The factors would be d1=4 (since 2^2) and d2=3, so 4*3=12.\n\n2. Assign 2 to d1 and 3 to d2, but d1 could also be 2 and d2=6, but wait 6 and 2 are not coprime. Wait no, must be coprime. \n\nWait, actually, the coprime factorizations require that d1 and d2 are coprime and multiply to 12. \n\nThe coprime pairs (d1, d2) with d1*d2=12:\n\n(1,12), (3,4), (4,3), (12,1). \n\nWait, but 3 and4 are coprime, 4 and3, etc. Also 1 and12 are coprime. \n\nThus, there are four coprime ordered pairs. \n\nIndeed, 2^2=4. \n\nHowever, in the case of b=13 (n=12), the number of solutions S is 3. \n\nWait, why the discrepancy? Because some of the solutions might fall outside the required interval [ceil(sqrt(13)), 12]. \n\nThe interval here is sqrt(13)\u22483.605, so ceil is 4 to 12. \n\nThe four solutions S would be the solutions to the congruences for each coprime pair. Let me find them:\n\nFor each coprime pair (d1, d2):\n\n1. (1,12): Solve S \u22610 mod1 and S \u22611 mod12. Since mod1 is always true, so S\u22611 mod12. The solution in [1,12] is S=1. But 1 is less than 4, so not counted.\n\n2. (3,4): Solve S \u22610 mod3 and S\u22611 mod4.\n\nFind S \u22610 mod3 and S\u22611 mod4.\n\nLet S=3k. Then 3k \u22611 mod4 \u2192 3k\u22611 mod4 \u2192 k\u22613 mod4. So k=3,7,11,... So S=9, 21,... but within 1-12, S=9.\n\n3. (4,3): Solve S\u22610 mod4 and S\u22611 mod3.\n\nS=4m. 4m \u22611 mod3 \u2192 m\u22611 mod3. So m=1,4,7,10 \u2192 S=4,16,... but within 1-12: 4 and 16 is out. So S=4 and 10 (4*2.5? Wait 4*1=4, 4*4=16>12. So S=4 and 10? Wait 4m \u22611 mod3. \n\nWait let's compute:\n\n4m \u22611 mod3 \u2192 4 \u22611 mod3, so 4m \u2261m mod3 \u22611 mod3 \u2192 m\u22611 mod3. So m=1,4,7,10.\n\nThus, S=4*1=4, 4*4=16 (too big). So only S=4. \n\nWait, but m=7 gives 4*7=28 which is over 12. Hmm, so only S=4 and S=10? Wait no, m=10 is 40 which is over. Wait, maybe I messed up.\n\nWait S must be \u226412. So m can be 1,4 (since 4*4=16>12). So S=4 and 16 is out. So only S=4.\n\nWait, but S=4: check 4 mod4 is 0, and 4 mod3 is 1? 4 mod3 is 1. Yes, 4 mod3=1. So yes, S=4 is a solution.\n\n4. (12,1): Solve S\u22610 mod12 and S\u22611 mod1. Since mod1 is trivial, S\u22610 mod12. The solution is 12. \n\nSo S=12. \n\nThus, the solutions S in [1,12] are 1,4,9,12. \n\nNow, considering the interval [4,12], we exclude S=1. So the valid S are 4,9,12. \n\nIndeed, as we saw earlier for b=13, the valid numbers were 16 (S=4: sqrt(16)=4), 81 (S=9), and 144 (S=12). So three solutions. \n\nThus, the total solutions are 4, but only 3 are in the required interval. \n\nTherefore, the formula 2^k gives the total solutions in [1,n], but we have to subtract those below ceil(sqrt(b)). \n\nTherefore, to get more than 10 solutions in the interval, we need 2^k > 10 + the number of solutions below the lower bound. \n\nAssuming that sqrt(b) is roughly sqrt(n+1), and n is the number of factors, so sqrt(n+1) is small compared to n, maybe the majority of solutions are in the upper half. \n\nTherefore, if we have 2^k solutions, and we need more than 10 in the upper part, so if 2^k is at least 20 or so, then maybe 10 would be in the upper. \n\nSo, with k=4 (2^4=16), maybe that could give 8 solutions in the upper half, but still not enough. \n\nk=5 gives 32 solutions, so maybe 16 in the upper, which would exceed 10. \n\nTherefore, the minimal n (b-1) with 5 distinct prime factors would be the product of the first 5 primes: 2*3*5*7*11=2310, so b=2311. But that's way too big. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a number with fewer distinct primes but with exponents allows more solutions? Wait, but the number of coprime factor pairs only depends on the number of distinct primes, not their exponents. \n\nFor example, if n=12=2^2*3, it has 2 distinct primes, so 2^2=4 solutions. \n\nIf n=16=2^4, which has only 1 distinct prime, so 2^1=2 solutions. \n\nWait, let's check with n=6 (2*3), so k=2, 4 solutions. Let me see for b=7 (n=6):\n\nFor b=7, n=6 (b-1=6). The coprime factorizations of 6 are (1,6),(2,3),(3,2),(6,1). \n\nThe solutions S would be:\n\n1. (1,6): S\u22610 mod1 and 1 mod6 \u2192 S=1 mod6. Solutions in 1-6: 1,7, but 7>6 so only S=1.\n\n2. (2,3): S\u22610 mod2 and 1 mod3. Find S even and S\u22611 mod3.\n\nPossible S=4 (4 mod3=1). \n\n3. (3,2): S\u22610 mod3 and 1 mod2 (odd). S=3 mod2=1. So S=3.\n\n4. (6,1): S\u22610 mod6 \u2192 S=6.\n\nThus solutions S=1,4,3,6. \n\nThe interval is ceil(sqrt(7))=3, so S must be between 3 and6. \n\nThus valid S:3,4,6. \n\nIndeed, for b=7, we had 3 solutions: S=3 (n=9), S=4 (16), S=6 (36). Wait n= S\u00b2, so 3\u00b2=9, 4\u00b2=16,6\u00b2=36. \n\nYes, so 3 solutions. Which matches the count. \n\nTherefore, with k=2 (since 6 has two primes), 2^2=4 solutions, 3 in the interval. \n\nThus, to get over 10 solutions in the interval, we need 2^k sufficiently large. \n\nSuppose we take a number with 4 distinct primes, so 2^4=16 total solutions. Then, assuming half are in the upper half, that would give 8 solutions. Not enough. \n\nWith 5 primes: 32 solutions. Maybe 16 in the interval. So, b-1 must be the product of first 5 primes: 2*3*5*7*11=2310. So b=2311. But that seems too big. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smaller number with 5 distinct prime factors? The smallest such number is indeed 2310. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a number with exponents on primes but still having 4 primes? Wait, but with 4 primes, it's still 16 solutions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different approach where the number of solutions is higher even with fewer primes. \n\nWait, perhaps if n is a factorial? Let me try n=12 (which is 2^2*3*1), but it's still two primes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe n=30 (2*3*5), which has 3 primes. Then 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nLet me test with n=30 (so b=31):\n\nThen the number of solutions S in [ceil(sqrt(31)),30]. sqrt(31)\u22485.56, so S from 6 to 30.\n\nThe number of solutions would be 2^3=8. Let's see if that's true.\n\nThe coprime factorizations of 30 (which is 2*3*5) into (d1,d2) are 2^3=8. Each combination of assigning primes to d1 or d2.\n\nFor example:\n\nPossible assignments:\n\nEach prime (2,3,5) can be assigned to d1 or d2.\n\nThus, the coprime factorizations are:\n\nd1=1, d2=30,\n\nd1=2, d2=15,\n\nd1=3, d2=10,\n\nd1=5, d2=6,\n\nd1=6, d2=5,\n\nd1=10, d2=3,\n\nd1=15, d2=2,\n\nd1=30, d2=1.\n\nTotal 8.\n\nEach of these gives a solution S in [1,30].\n\nLet's compute the solutions:\n\n1. (1,30): S \u22610 mod1 and 1 mod30 \u2192 S=1 mod30 \u2192 S=1 (too low).\n\n2. (2,15): S\u22610 mod2 and 1 mod15. \n\nFind S even and S\u22611 mod15.\n\nS=1 mod15 \u2192 1,16,31,\u2026 Within 1-30: 1 and16. S must be even: 16.\n\n3. (3,10): S\u22610 mod3 and 1 mod10.\n\nS\u22611 mod10 \u2192 1,11,21,31,\u2026 Within 1-30: 1,11,21.\n\nMust also be divisible by 3:\n\nCheck 1: 1 mod3\u22600 \u2192 no.\n\n11 mod3=2 \u2192 no.\n\n21 mod3=0 \u2192 yes. So S=21.\n\n4. (5,6): S\u22610 mod5 and 1 mod6.\n\nS\u22611 mod6 \u21921,7,13,19,25,31,\u2026 Within 1-30:1,7,13,19,25.\n\nMust also be divisible by5:\n\nCheck 5 divides 25. So S=25.\n\n5. (6,5): S\u22610 mod6 and 1 mod5.\n\nS\u22611 mod5 \u21921,6,11,16,21,26,\u2026 Within 1-30:1,6,11,16,21,26.\n\nMust also be divisible by6:\n\n6: 6 mod5=1? 6 mod5=1 \u2192 yes. So S=6.\n\n26 mod5=1? 26 mod5=1 \u2192 yes. 26 divisible by6? 26/6\u22484.33 \u2192 no. \n\nNext: 6 and 26? 6 is divisible by6. So S=6 and 26? Wait 26 isn't divisible by6. So only S=6.\n\nWait 6 mod5=1, yes. 6 is divisible by6. So S=6.\n\n6. (10,3): S\u22610 mod10 and 1 mod3.\n\nS\u22611 mod3 \u21921,4,7,10,13,\u2026 Within 1-30: multiples of10 plus those congruent to 1 mod3.\n\nWait S\u22610 mod10 \u2192 S=10,20,30.\n\nCheck which of these \u22611 mod3:\n\n10 mod3=1 \u2192 yes.\n\n20 mod3=2 \u2192 no.\n\n30 mod3=0 \u2192 no.\n\nThus S=10.\n\n7. (15,2): S\u22610 mod15 and 1 mod2.\n\nS\u22611 mod2 \u2192 odd.\n\nS must be multiple of15 and odd: 15,45,\u2026 Within 1-30:15.\n\n8. (30,1): S\u22610 mod30 \u2192 S=30.\n\nSo the solutions are S=1,16,21,25,6,10,15,30.\n\nNow, the interval is S from 6 to30 (since ceil(sqrt(31))=6). Excluding S=1. \n\nThus valid S:6,10,15,16,21,25,30. That's 7 solutions. \n\nHmm, but 2^3=8 solutions total, so 7 in the interval. \n\nThus, for b=31, there are 7 b-beautiful numbers. Still under 10. \n\nContinuing this way, for b=2*3*5*7=210 (so n=210, k=4 primes):\n\nThen the number of solutions would be 2^4=16. Let's see:\n\nThe interval would be ceil(sqrt(211))\u224815, so S from 15 to210.\n\nAssuming half the solutions are above sqrt(n+1), so maybe 8 solutions. \n\nBut let's see:\n\nAlternatively, let's try with n=210 (b=211):\n\nThe number of coprime factorizations is 2^4=16. \n\nIf we can assume that roughly half are in the upper half, that would give 8 solutions. Still under 10. \n\nHmm, so with 4 primes, we get 8 solutions. \n\nWith 5 primes, n=2310 (b=2311), we get 16 solutions in the upper half, which would be over 10. But this is a very large b. \n\nBut maybe there is a smarter number with fewer primes but more solutions. \n\nWait, perhaps if n is a square of a number with many factors?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n can be a power of 2? Let me see:\n\nTake n=16 (b=17). \n\nn=16=2^4. \n\nIt has only one distinct prime, so 2^1=2 solutions. \n\nIndeed, the coprime factorizations are (1,16) and (16,1). \n\nThe solutions S would be:\n\nFor (1,16): S=1 mod16 \u2192 S=1 (too low).\n\nFor (16,1): S=16. \n\nThus only S=16 is in the interval (ceil(sqrt(17))=5 to 16). So count=1. \n\nHmm, no good. \n\nAlternatively, n=24 (b=25). \n\nn=24 has prime factors 2^3*3, so two distinct primes. So 2^2=4 solutions. \n\nLet me compute them:\n\nCoprime factorizations:\n\n(1,24),(2,12),(3,8),(4,6),(6,4),(8,3),(12,2),(24,1). But need coprime pairs. \n\nWait coprime pairs must have gcd(d1,d2)=1. So:\n\nFactors must be coprime. \n\nLooking at factor pairs where gcd(d1,d2)=1:\n\n(1,24), gcd=1,\n\n(3,8), gcd=1,\n\n(8,3),\n\n(24,1),\n\n(2,12): gcd(2,12)=2\u22601,\n\n(4,6): gcd(4,6)=2\u22601,\n\n(6,4): same,\n\n(12,2): same,\n\n(3,8): already listed,\n\nSo the coprime factorizations are (1,24), (3,8), (8,3), (24,1). So four solutions.\n\nThus, solutions S:\n\nFor (1,24): S\u22611 mod24 \u2192 S=1 (too low).\n\nFor (3,8): S\u22610 mod3 and 1 mod8.\n\nFind S divisible by3 and S\u22611 mod8.\n\nLet S=3k. 3k\u22611 mod8 \u2192 3k\u22611 mod8 \u2192 k\u22613 mod8 (since 3*3=9\u22611 mod8). So k=3,11,\u2026 So S=9,33,\u2026 within 1-24: 9 and 33>24. So S=9.\n\nFor (8,3): S\u22610 mod8 and 1 mod3.\n\nS=8m. 8m \u22611 mod3 \u2192 8\u22612 mod3 \u2192 2m\u22611 mod3 \u2192 m\u22612 mod3 \u2192 m=2,5,8,\u2026 \n\nS=16,40,\u2026 Within 1-24:16 and 40>24. So S=16.\n\nFor (24,1): S\u22610 mod24 \u2192 S=24.\n\nThus solutions S=1,9,16,24. \n\nInterval is ceil(sqrt(25))=5 to24. Excluding S=1, we have 9,16,24. So 3 solutions. \n\nHmm, so even with two primes, the count is low. \n\nHmm, this suggests that to get over 10 solutions, we need at least 5 distinct prime factors, leading to b=2311, but maybe there is a smaller number with more solutions through some other means?\n\nWait, perhaps if n has multiple prime factors with exponents, but the number of coprime factorizations is still based on the distinct primes. So even with exponents, the coprime factorizations depend only on distinct primes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe n has repeated primes but arranged such that more solutions fall into the required interval. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find a b where the number of S is more than 10, even with fewer prime factors. Let's try with b= 2520, which is 2^3*3^2*5*7, but still four distinct primes. \n\nBut this is getting too large. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong and there's another way. \n\nWait let me try with b= 252 (which is 2^2*3^2*7). The number of distinct primes is 3 (2,3,7). So 2^3=8 solutions. Maybe in the interval, more solutions? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find a b where the number of S is more than 10. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking back at the equation:\n\nWe have d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b-1). \n\nSince d1 must be between 1 and b-1, so:\n\n1 \u2264 (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nCross multiplying:\n\nb -1 \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me rearrange the first inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 - S \u2265 b -1 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - (b-1) \u22650\n\nThe second inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - (b-1)^2 \u22640\n\nTherefore, combining these inequalities:\n\nb -1 \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me denote k = b -1, so:\n\nk \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 k\u00b2\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 - S -k \u22650,\n\nand S\u00b2 - S -k\u00b2 \u22640.\n\nSo for each k, we need to find S such that sqrt(k + S) ... Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, solving S\u00b2 - S -k \u22650 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S \u2265k,\n\nand S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2.\n\nLet me consider S is approximately sqrt(k\u00b2) =k, so when S is close to k, the terms might satisfy the inequalities.\n\nLet me consider S =k - m for some m. \n\nThen, substitute S =k - m into the inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality:\n\n(k -m)^2 - (k -m) \u2265k \u2192 k\u00b2 - 2km + m\u00b2 -k +m \u2265k \u2192k\u00b2 -2km +m\u00b2 -k +m -k \u22650 \u2192k\u00b2 -2km +m\u00b2 -2k +m \u22650.\n\nNot sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider S = sqrt(k). \n\nWait, let me think of possible S values in terms of k. \n\nSuppose S is about sqrt(k), then S\u00b2 - S would be around k, so the first inequality holds. The second inequality would require that S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2. Which is true because S is at most sqrt(k)\u00b2 =k. So maybe this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, think of S being between sqrt(k) and k. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions S is equal to the number of integers S in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k] such that S(S-1) is divisible by k. \n\nTherefore, for each k, count the number of S in that interval where k divides S(S-1). \n\nPerhaps I can find a k where this count exceeds 10. \n\nLet me try some larger k. Let me try k= 24 (so b=25):\n\nWait we did that earlier and got 3 solutions. \n\nk=60 (b=61):\n\nPrime factors of 60 are 2^2*3*5 \u2192 3 distinct primes. So 2^3=8 solutions. Let me see:\n\nThe interval is ceil(sqrt(61))\u22488, so S from 8 to60.\n\nNumber of solutions would be 8 total, but some may be in the interval. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute:\n\nThe coprime factorizations of 60 (2^2*3*5) are 2^3=8.\n\nSolutions S:\n\nLet me pick a factor pair, say (3,20). \n\nWait this is going to take time. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try k= 120 (b=121). \n\nPrime factors of 120: 2^3*3*5 \u2192 three distinct primes. 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nStill not enough. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to try k= 210 (b=211):\n\nPrime factors 2*3*5*7 \u2192 four primes, so 2^4=16 solutions. \n\nAssuming half are in the interval, that would be 8. Still under 10. \n\nk= 420 (b=421):\n\nPrime factors 2^2*3*5*7 \u2192 four primes. Still four distinct primes. 2^4=16 solutions. \n\nHmm, so even with four primes, it's 16 total solutions, so maybe 8 in the interval. \n\nHmm, so maybe with five primes, which would be 32 solutions, leading to 16 in the interval. \n\nTherefore, the minimal k is the product of first five primes:2*3*5*7*11=2310. Thus b=2311. \n\nBut that's a very large b. However, the problem states to find the least integer b\u22652. Maybe there's a smarter way?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier assumption. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose that for a given S, the number of b's such that b-1 divides S(S-1) and b is in (S, S\u00b2].\n\nTherefore, for each S, the number of such b's is equal to the number of divisors of S(S-1) that are between S and S\u00b2 -1. \n\nTherefore, the total number of b-eautiful numbers across all b is the sum over S of the number of such b's for each S. \n\nBut we need the first b where the count exceeds 10. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a particular S, there are many b's. \n\nWait, let's think of S= 10. Then S(S-1)=90. The divisors of 90 are many. \n\nLet me see:\n\nIf S=10, then S(S-1)=90. So for any b-1 dividing 90, and b must be between 10+1=11 and 10\u00b2=100. \n\nSo b-1 must be a divisor of90 between 10 and99. \n\nThe divisors of90 are:\n\n1,2,3,5,6,9,10,15,18,30,45,90.\n\nSo between10 and99:10,15,18,30,45,90. \n\nThus, b-1 can be 10,15,18,30,45,90 \u2192 b=11,16,19,31,46,91. \n\nEach of these b's will have S=10 as a solution. \n\nSo for each of these b's, there is at least one solution (S=10). \n\nSimilarly, for other S values, they can contribute to multiple b's. \n\nTherefore, the total number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is the number of S such that b-1 divides S(S-1) and S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. \n\nTo have more than 10 solutions for a particular b, we need many S's such that S(S-1) is divisible by (b-1). \n\nTherefore, if (b-1) is a number that divides many S(S-1) terms for S in the required range. \n\nPerhaps if (b-1) is 12 (as in the example with b=13). Let's see:\n\nFor b=13 (k=12), the divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. \n\nThe S's for which 12 divides S(S-1) must satisfy S(S-1) mod12=0. \n\nThis happens when either S\u22610 mod4 and S\u22610 mod3 (since 12=4*3), but more precisely, since S and S-1 are coprime, 12 must divide either S or S-1. \n\nWait, since gcd(S,S-1)=1, so 12 must divide S or divide S-1. \n\nTherefore, S \u22610 mod12 or S\u22611 mod12. \n\nThus, S can be 12 (which is within the interval up to b-1=12) or S=1 mod12. \n\nBut S must be \u2265 ceil(sqrt(13))\u22484. So S=1 mod12 within 4-12 would be S=13 mod12=1, but 1 is below 4. The next is S=13-12=1? Not. So only S=12 and S=4 (wait, maybe other conditions? \n\nWait, the previous analysis showed solutions at S=4,9,12. \n\nWait, perhaps my previous approach is better. \n\nAlternatively, to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, perhaps I can compute for b= 36:\n\nWait let's try b= 36 (k=35). \n\nWait 35 factors into 5*7. \n\nSo the coprime factorizations are (1,35),(5,7),(7,5),(35,1). \n\nThus four solutions. \n\nInterval: sqrt(36)=6, so S from6 to35.\n\nSolutions:\n\nFor (1,35): S\u22611 mod35 \u21921 (too low).\n\nFor (5,7): S\u22610 mod5 and1 mod7. \n\nFind S=5m\u22611 mod7. \n\n5m \u22611 mod7 \u2192 m\u22613 mod7 (since 5*3=15\u22611 mod7). So m=3,10,17,24,31 \u2192 S=15,50,\u2026 but within 1-35:15,30. \n\nCheck S=15: 15 mod5=0, 15 mod7=1. Yes.\n\nS=30: 30 mod5=0, 30 mod7=2. Not. So only S=15.\n\nFor (7,5): S\u22610 mod7 and1 mod5. \n\nS=7n\u22611 mod5 \u21927n\u22611 mod5 \u21922n\u22611 mod5 \u2192n\u22613 mod5. \n\nThus n=3,8,13,18,23 \u2192 S=21,56,\u2026 Within 1-35:21, 56>35. So S=21. \n\nCheck 21 mod7=0, 21 mod5=1. Yes.\n\nFor (35,1): S\u22610 mod35 \u219235.\n\nThus solutions S=15,21,35. \n\nSo count is3.

So inverse is7. \n\nThus a\u22617 mod19. \n\nThus S=11*(7+19m)=77+209m. Within 1-209, S=77 and 77+209=286>209.

Let's try b= 720+1=721. \n\nWait, b=721 (k=720). \n\n720 has prime factors 2^4*3^2*5. So distinct primes 2,3,5.

Maybe my initial assumption that we need 5 primes is correct, but perhaps the minimal b is smaller?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the number of solutions is exactly 2^k. \n\nWait, for example, with n=6 (b=7), which has two primes, the number of coprime factorizations is four, but the number of solutions in the interval was 3. So perhaps it's 2^{k} minus the ones below the interval. \n\nTherefore, if we have 2^{k} solutions total, and the interval is roughly from sqrt(n) to n, which is a significant portion, maybe the number of solutions in the interval is roughly 2^{k} - sqrt(n). \n\nThus, to have more than 10 solutions, 2^{k} - sqrt(n) >10. \n\nSince n =b-1, which is roughly 2^{k} (if primes are small), but this is getting too vague. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to try b= 120 (k=119). Wait tried that.\n\nAlternatively, try b= 2520 (k=2519). \n\nWait that's too big. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of S such that S(S-1) is divisible by many numbers. \n\nFor instance, S= 10, as above, contributes to b=11,16,19,31,46,91. \n\nSimilarly, S= 11: S(S-1)=110. Divisors of 110 are 1,2,5,10,11,22,55,110. \n\nThus for b-1 in 11 to 110, divisors are 10,11,22,55,110. \n\nThus b=11,12,23,56,111. \n\nEach of these b's get a solution from S=11. \n\nContinuing this way, perhaps a b that is a common multiple of many such S(S-1) terms. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 60:\n\nWait k=59, prime. \n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, b= 120. \n\nWait tried that. \n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121 (k=120). \n\nk=120 has prime factors 2^3*3*5 \u2192 three distinct primes. So 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nThe interval is sqrt(121)=11 \u219211 to120.\n\nThe number of solutions would be 8, minus those below 11. \n\nThe solutions S are:\n\nFor each coprime factorization of 120:\n\n(1,120): S=1 mod120 \u21921 (too low)\n\n(2,60): gcd(2,60)=2\u22601 \u2192 not coprime.\n\nWait coprime factorizations must have gcd(d1,d2)=1. \n\nSo factors must be coprime. \n\nPrime factors are 2,3,5. \n\nPossible coprime pairs:\n\n(1,120),\n\n(3,40) (since 3 and40 are coprime),\n\n(5,24),\n\n(8,15),\n\n(15,8),\n\n(24,5),\n\n(40,3),\n\n(120,1).\n\nThus eight solutions. \n\nCompute each:\n\n(3,40): S\u22610 mod3 and1 mod40.\n\nS=3a \u22611 mod40 \u21923a\u22611 mod40 \u2192a\u226127 mod40 (3*27=81\u22611 mod40). \n\na=27 \u2192 S=81. \n\n(5,24): S\u22610 mod5 and1 mod24. \n\nS=5b\u22611 mod24 \u21925b\u22611 mod24 \u2192b\u22615 mod24 (5*5=25\u22611 mod24). \n\nb=5 \u2192S=25. \n\n(8,15): S\u22610 mod8 and1 mod15.\n\nS=8c\u22611 mod15 \u21928c\u22611 mod15 \u2192c\u22612 mod15 (8*2=16\u22611 mod15). \n\nc=2 \u2192S=16. \n\n(15,8): S\u22610 mod15 and1 mod8.\n\nS=15d\u22611 mod8 \u219215\u22617 mod8 \u21927d\u22611 mod8 \u2192d\u22617 mod8 (7*7=49\u22611 mod8). \n\nd=7 \u2192S=105. \n\n(24,5): S\u22610 mod24 and1 mod5. \n\nS=24e\u22611 mod5 \u219224\u22614 mod5 \u21924e\u22611 mod5 \u2192e\u22614 mod5 (4*4=16\u22611 mod5). \n\ne=4 \u2192S=96. \n\n(40,3): S\u22610 mod40 and1 mod3. \n\nS=40f\u22611 mod3 \u219240\u22611 mod3 \u2192f\u22611 mod3. \n\nf=1 \u2192S=40. \n\n(120,1): S=120. \n\nThus the solutions are S=16,25,40,81,96,105,120. \n\nExcluding S=1, which is too low, so count is7. \n\nHmm, still under 10. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 210 (k=209). \n\nWait k=209=11*19. \n\nThus coprime factorizations are four solutions. \n\nAs before, the count was 3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 210 (k=209). \n\nWait no, already tried.\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe b= 252 (k=251, prime). \n\nNo. \n\nHmm, perhaps the minimal b is 2311, but the problem says \"the least integer b \u22652\", which might be smaller. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the coprime factorization approach. Let me think differently.\n\nThe equation is d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1), and d0 = S - d1. \n\nSince d0 must be between 0 and b-1, so S - d1 must be in that range. \n\nBut since d1 is between 1 and b-1, S must be between d1 and d1 + (b-1). \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to set up S and b such that multiple S work for the same b. \n\nSuppose we pick b-1 such that it divides multiple S(S-1). \n\nFor example, if b-1 is 24 (so b=25), then S(S-1) must be divisible by24. \n\nPossible S such that S(S-1) divisible by24:\n\nSince 24=3*8, so S or S-1 must be divisible by3, and one of S or S-1 divisible by8, or split between 2^3 and3. \n\nPossible S:\n\nLet me list S from 5 to24 (since ceil(sqrt(25))=5):\n\nCheck which S(S-1) divisible by24.\n\nCompute S(S-1) mod24:\n\nS=5:5*4=20 mod24=20\u2192 no\n\nS=6:6*5=30 mod24=6\u2192 no\n\nS=7:7*6=42 mod24=18\u2192 no\n\nS=8:8*7=56 mod24=8\u2192 no\n\nS=9:9*8=72 mod24=0\u2192 yes\n\nS=10:10*9=90 mod24=18\u2192 no\n\nS=11:11*10=110 mod24=110-4*24=110-96=14\u2192 no\n\nS=12:12*11=132 mod24=0\u2192 yes (132-5*24=132-120=12\u2192 no, wait 132/24=5.5, so remainder 12?

Thus 2^2=4 solutions. \n\nThe coprime factorizations:\n\n(1,24),(3,8),(8,3),(24,1). \n\nThus solutions S:\n\nFor (3,8):\n\nS\u22610 mod3 and1 mod8 \u2192S=15.\n\nFor (8,3):\n\nS\u22610 mod8 and1 mod3 \u2192S=16.\n\nFor (24,1):24.\n\nThus solutions S=15,16,24.\n\nInterval is sqrt(25)=5 \u21925-24. \n\nThus count=3.\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 12 (k=11, prime). \n\nThus solutions S=1 mod11 and 0 mod11. \n\nThus S=11 and1 (excluded). \n\nThus count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider when b-1 is a square. Let me try b= 25 (k=24). \n\nNo, already tried. \n\nAlternatively, b= 36 (k=35=5\u00d77). \n\nThus coprime factorizations (1,35),(5,7),(7,5),(35,1). \n\nSolutions S=15,21,35. \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider a number with multiple exponents but still having enough coprime factorizations. \n\nWait let me try b= 105 (k=104=8\u00d713). \n\nThus coprime factorizations (1,104),(8,13),(13,8),(104,1). \n\nSolutions S=40,65,104. \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 1369 (k=1368= 2^3*3^2*19). \n\nWait this is getting too large. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the minimal b is 121, which gives 7 solutions, but I need to find a b with more than 10. \n\nWait, let me try b= 169 (k=168=2^3*3*7). \n\nPrime factors are 2,3,7 \u2192 three primes. Thus 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nThus, the interval is sqrt(169)=13 to168. \n\nThus the count would be 8 minus any solutions below 13. \n\nLet me compute the solutions:\n\nCoprime factorizations of 168 (2^3*3*7):\n\nPossible coprime factorizations are (1,168),(3,56),(7,24),(8,21),(21,8),(24,7),(56,3),(168,1). \n\nThus eight solutions. \n\nCompute each:\n\n(3,56): S\u22610 mod3 and1 mod56. \n\nS=3a\u22611 mod56 \u21923a\u22611 mod56 \u2192a\u226137 mod56 (3*37=111\u22611 mod56). \n\nThus a=37 \u2192S=111. \n\n(7,24): S\u22610 mod7 and1 mod24. \n\nS=7b\u22611 mod24 \u21927b\u22611 mod24 \u2192b\u22617 mod24 (7*7=49\u22611 mod24). \n\nThus b=7 \u2192S=49. \n\n(8,21): S\u22610 mod8 and1 mod21. \n\nS=8c\u22611 mod21 \u21928c\u22611 mod21 \u2192c\u22618^{-1} mod21. \n\n8*8=64\u22611 mod21 \u2192c\u22618 mod21. \n\nThus c=8 \u2192S=64. \n\n(21,8): S\u22610 mod21 and1 mod8. \n\nS=21d\u22611 mod8 \u219221\u22615 mod8 \u21925d\u22611 mod8 \u2192d\u22615 mod8. \n\nd=5 \u2192S=105. \n\n(24,7): S\u22610 mod24 and1 mod7. \n\nS=24e\u22611 mod7 \u219224\u22613 mod7 \u21923e\u22611 mod7 \u2192e\u22615 mod7. \n\ne=5 \u2192S=120. \n\n(56,3): S\u22610 mod56 and1 mod3. \n\nS=56f\u22611 mod3 \u219256\u22612 mod3 \u21922f\u22611 mod3 \u2192f\u22612 mod3. \n\nf=2 \u2192S=112. \n\n(168,1): S=168. \n\nThus solutions S=49,64,105,111,112,120,168. \n\nExcluding S=1, the count is7. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, this is really perplexing. Maybe I need to consider that the problem might require a different approach. \n\nWait, let me think differently. The equation is S\u00b2 =d1*b +d0, and S=d1 +d0. \n\nSubstituting d0=S-d1 gives S\u00b2 =d1*b + (S-d1) \u2192 S\u00b2 -S =d1*(b-1). \n\nSo, d1=(S\u00b2 -S)/(b-1). \n\nSince d1 must be an integer between1 and b-1, then (S\u00b2 -S) must be divisible by (b-1), and the result must be between1 and b-1. \n\nThus, for each S, the possible b-1 must be a divisor of S(S-1), and (b-1) must be between (S\u00b2 -S)/(b-1) >=1 and <=b-1. \n\nWait, but this is circular. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of b-1 divides S(S-1), so b-1 \u2264 S(S-1). \n\nAnd also, since n=S\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so b \u2264S\u00b2 <b\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, b must be between S and S\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, for each S, possible b's are divisors of S(S-1) between S and S\u00b2. \n\nThus, the total number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is the number of S such that S(S-1) is divisible by (b-1) and b is between S and S\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, to find the first b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps I can iterate S and count the number of b's contributed by each S. \n\nFor example, S=10 contributes to b's where b-1 divides 90, and b is between10 and100. \n\nSimilarly, S=11 contributes to divisors of 110 between11 and 121. \n\nIf I can find a b that is in the range of multiple S's. \n\nLet me try to list the number of S's for a particular b by considering all S such that S(S-1) divisible by (b-1) and b is between S and S\u00b2. \n\nSuppose we pick b= 120 (k=119). \n\nThen we need S such that S(S-1) divisible by119, and S between ceil(sqrt(120))=11 and119. \n\nThe solutions are S=35,85,119. So three. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider b= 210 (k=209). \n\nS must be between15 and209. \n\nSolutions are S=77,133,209. Three. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 252 (k=251, prime). Only two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 360 (k=359, prime). Two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, b= 420 (k=419, prime). Two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 840 (k=839, prime). Two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, b= 90 (k=89, prime). Two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 105 (k=104). \n\nSolutions S=40,65,104. Three. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 180 (k=179, prime). Two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 210 (k=209). \n\nWait done. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is really frustrating. Maybe the minimal b is 2311, but that seems too big. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem understanding. \n\nThe problem says \"the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers\". \n\nPerhaps there is a b where multiple S's contribute. \n\nLet me try S= 12:\n\nS(S-1)=132. \n\nDivisors of 132 between12 and144 (since b must be between12 and144). \n\nDivisors of132:1,2,3,4,6,11,12,22,33,44,66,132. \n\nSo between12 and144:\n\n12,22,33,44,66,132. \n\nThus b-1=12,22,33,44,66,132 \u2192b=13,23,34,45,67,133. \n\nEach of these b's gets a solution from S=12. \n\nSimilarly, S=13:\n\nS(S-1)=156. \n\nDivisors between13 and169:\n\n13,26,39,52,78,156. \n\nThus b=14,27,40,53,79,157. \n\nS=14:\n\nS(S-1)=182. Divisors between14 and196:\n\n14,26,91,182. \n\nThus b=15,27,92,183. \n\nContinuing this way, for each S, there are several b's. \n\nThus, the total number of b-eautiful numbers for a particular b is the number of S's such that b-1 divides S(S-1) and b is between S and S\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, to have more than ten b-eautiful numbers for a given b, there must be more than ten S's such that b-1 divides S(S-1) and S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. \n\nPerhaps the first b where this occurs is when b-1 is a highly composite number with many factors, allowing many S's. \n\nThe smallest highly composite number with many factors is 360 (360 has 24 divisors), but let me check b= 361 (k=360). \n\n360 factors are many: 2^3*3^2*5. \n\nPrime factors:2,3,5. \n\nThus coprime factorizations: 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nBut the interval is sqrt(361)=19 \u219219 to360. \n\nThe solutions would be S such that S(S-1) divisible by360. \n\nThis requires S or S-1 divisible by 8, 9, and 5 in some combination. \n\nThis could result in more solutions. \n\nLet me try to compute the number of solutions for b=361 (k=360):\n\nPrime factors of360 are 2^3,3^2,5. \n\nThe coprime factorizations require assigning primes to d1 or d2. \n\nEach prime group must be entirely in one factor. \n\nThus, the coprime factor pairs are determined by the assignment of the prime factors to d1 or d2. \n\nThe number of coprime factorizations is 2^3=8 (since three distinct primes:2,3,5). \n\nEach such factorization corresponds to a solution S. \n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. (1,360): S\u22611 mod360 \u21921 (too low).\n\n2. (2^3, 3^2*5)= (8,45): S\u22610 mod8 and1 mod45. \n\nFind S=8a\u22611 mod45 \u21928a\u22611 mod45 \u2192a\u226129 mod45 (8*29=232\u2261232-5*45=232-225=7 mod45 \u2192 no, wait. \n\nWait 8a\u22611 mod45. \n\nFind inverse of8 mod45. \n\n45=5*9. \n\nFind x such that8x\u22611 mod45. \n\nTrying 8* 29=232 mod45: 232-5*45=232-225=7 mod45. Not. \n\n8* 23=184 mod45: 184-4*45=184-180=4 mod45. \n\n8* 32=256 mod45:256-5*45=256-225=31 mod45. \n\nHmm, this is time-consuming. Maybe better to use the extended Euclidean algorithm. \n\nFind integers x,y such that8x +45y=1. \n\n45=5*8 +5 \n\n8=1*5 +3 \n\n5=1*3 +2 \n\n3=1*2 +1 \n\n2=2*1 +0 \n\nBackwards:\n\n1=3-1*2 \n\n=3 -1*(5 -1*3) =2*3 -5 \n\n=2*(8 -1*5) -5 =2*8 -3*5 \n\n=2*8 -3*(45 -5*8) =2*8 -3*45 +15*8 \n\n=17*8 -3*45 \n\nThus x=17 mod45. \n\nThus a\u226117 mod45. \n\nThus S=8*17=136. \n\n3.

Two solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to concede that perhaps the minimal b is 2311, but since that is too big, there must be a smaller b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants us to consider when the number of solutions exceeds 10, so perhaps when the number of coprime factorizations exceeds 10. \n\nWait, for k= 240 (2^4*3*5). \n\nPrime factors 2,3,5 \u2192 three primes. \n\nThus 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me consider k= 120 (2^3*3*5). \n\nThree primes. \n\nThus 8 solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of b= 840 (k=839, prime). Two solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach. Let me think of the equation again: \n\nWe need S(S-1) divisible by (b-1), and S between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. \n\nIf we pick b-1= 24 (so b=25), then S can be 9,16,24. \n\nBut if I pick b-1= 60 (b=61), then S can be  10, 15, 20, 30, etc.? \n\nWait let me compute for b=61 (k=60):\n\nPrime factors of60: 2^2*3*5 \u2192 three primes. \n\nThus 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nInterval sqrt(61)=7.8 \u21928 to60. \n\nSolutions S=?\n\nCoprime factorizations:\n\n(1,60),(3,20),(4,15),(5,12),(12,5),(15,4),(20,3),(60,1). \n\nWait coprime pairs must have gcd(d1,d2)=1. \n\nThus valid coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,60),(3,20),(4,15),(5,12). \n\nTheir reverses are also valid. \n\nThus total 8 solutions. \n\nLet me compute them:\n\n(3,20): S\u22610 mod3 and1 mod20. \n\nS=3a\u22611 mod20 \u21923a\u22611 mod20 \u2192a\u22617 mod20 (3*7=21\u22611 mod20). \n\nThus a=7 \u2192S=21. \n\n(20,3): S\u22610 mod20 and1 mod3. \n\nS=20b\u22611 mod3 \u219220\u22612 mod3 \u21922b\u22611 mod3 \u2192b\u22612 mod3. \n\nb=2 \u2192S=40. \n\n(4,15): S\u22610 mod4 and1 mod15. \n\nS=4c\u22611 mod15 \u21924c\u22611 mod15 \u2192c\u22614 mod15 (4*4=16\u22611 mod15). \n\nThus c=4 \u2192S=16. \n\n(15,4): S\u22610 mod15 and1 mod4. \n\nS=15d\u22611 mod4 \u219215\u22613 mod4 \u21923d\u22611 mod4 \u2192d\u22613 mod4. \n\nd=3 \u2192S=45. \n\n(5,12): S\u22610 mod5 and1 mod12. \n\nS=5e\u22611 mod12 \u21925e\u22611 mod12 \u2192e\u22615 mod12 (5*5=25\u22611 mod12). \n\nThus e=5 \u2192S=25. \n\n(12,5): S\u22610 mod12 and1 mod5. \n\nS=12f\u22611 mod5 \u219212\u22612 mod5 \u21922f\u22611 mod5 \u2192f\u22613 mod5. \n\nf=3 \u2192S=36. \n\n(60,1): S=60. \n\n(1,60): S=1 (too low). \n\nThus the solutions are S=16,21,25,36,40,45,60. \n\nInterval is 8 to60. \n\nThus count=7. \n\nHmm, still under 10. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to try b= 252 (k=251, prime). \n\nNo, only two solutions. \n\nAlternatively, b= 360 (k=359, prime).

Then:\n\nx \u2264S\u00b2 -S \u2264x\u00b2. \n\nThus, for each S, x can be any integer between S\u00b2 -S and x\u00b2 \u2265S\u00b2 -S \u2192 x \u2265sqrt(S\u00b2 -S). \n\nTherefore, for each S, the possible x are from max(ceil(sqrt(S\u00b2 -S)), S) up to S\u00b2 -S. \n\nBut since x must also be less than S\u00b2 (since b=x+1 must be less than S\u00b2). \n\nThus, the number of x's (i.e., b's) for each S is the number of integers between max(ceil(sqrt(S\u00b2 -S)), S) and S\u00b2 -S. \n\nTherefore, the total number of b's for a given S is (S\u00b2 -S) - max(ceil(sqrt(S\u00b2 -S)), S) +1. \n\nTo find the minimal b where the total exceeds 10, perhaps we need to find S such that the number of b's is large. \n\nFor example, take S= 10:\n\nThe number of x's (b-1) is between max(ceil(sqrt(100-10)),10)=max(9,10)=10 and 90. \n\nThus, 90-10+1=81 numbers. \n\nThus S=10 contributes 81 b's. \n\nBut each b can have multiple S's. \n\nWait, but we need to find a b where the number of S's is more than10. \n\nThus, for a particular b, the number of S's is the number of S such that S(S-1) divisible by (b-1), and S between sqrt(b) and b-1. \n\nThus, to have more than ten S's for a given b, we need many S's such that (b-1) divides S(S-1). \n\nThus, if b-1 is a highly composite number with many factors, then there are many S's. \n\nThe first number with more than ten divisors is 24 (24 has 8 divisors), 36 (9), 48 (10), 60 (12). \n\nWait, 60 has 12 divisors. \n\nThus, let's try b=61 (k=60). \n\nAs before, for b=61 (k=60), we had seven solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nNext, 120 has 16 divisors. \n\nThus b=121 (k=120) gives seven solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nNext, 180 has 18 divisors. \n\nLet me try b=181 (k=180). \n\nPrime factors of 180: 2\u00b2*3\u00b2*5. \n\nDistinct primes:2,3,5. Thus 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nThus the count would be around 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nNext, 240 has 20 divisors. \n\nb=241 (k=240). \n\nPrime factors of240:2^4*3*5. \n\nDistinct primes:2,3,5 \u2192 three. Thus 8 solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nNext, 360 has 24 divisors. \n\nb=361 (k=360). \n\nAs before, seven solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nNext, 720 has 30 divisors. \n\nb=721 (k=720). \n\nPrime factors:2^4*3^2*5*7. \n\nDistinct primes:2,3,5,7 \u2192 four. Thus 16 solutions. \n\nThus the count could be around 16 solutions. \n\nThus, for b=721, the interval is sqrt(721)=26.85 \u219227 to720. \n\nThe number of solutions would be 16 minus those below 27. \n\nAssuming half are in the upper half, maybe 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, this is not working. Maybe the minimal b is 2311. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a different approach. Let me think of the equation again:\n\nd1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b-1). \n\nSince d1 must be an integer between1 and b-1, then:\n\n(S\u00b2 - S) must be divisible by (b-1). \n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nb = (S\u00b2 - S)/d1 +1. \n\nThus, for each S and d1 such that d1 divides S(S-1), and 1 \u2264d1 \u2264b-1. \n\nBut b is dependent on d1. \n\nAlternatively, for a given S, possible d1 can be any divisor of S(S-1), and then b is determined. \n\nThus, the total number of b's is the number of divisors of S(S-1) for S in a range. \n\nBut I need to find a b where multiple S's contribute. \n\nAlternatively, if I set d1=1, then b=S(S-1)+1. \n\nThus, for any S, there is a b where d1=1. \n\nThus, for S from2 upwards, b=S(S-1)+1. \n\nThus, each S gives a unique b where d1=1. \n\nThus, for example, S=11 gives b=110+1=111. \n\nThus, for b=111, there is at least one solution (S=11). \n\nSimilarly, S=10 gives b=91. \n\nThus, for each b of the form S(S-1)+1, there is at least one solution. \n\nThus, the count for these b's is at least one. \n\nTo have more than ten solutions, need at least ten different S's such that S(S-1)+1=b, and other conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is when S ranges up to a point where there are multiple S's leading to the same b. \n\nAlternatively, consider that for b-1= S(S-1), then d1=1, so n=S\u00b2. \n\nThus, for each S, there is a b=S(S-1)+1. \n\nThus, for example, S=11 gives b=111. \n\nThus, the count for b=111 would have at least one solution. \n\nBut to have more than ten, need ten different S's such that b-1 divides S(S-1). \n\nPerhaps if b-1 is a common multiple of many S(S-1) terms. \n\nThe smallest number that is a multiple of S(S-1) for ten different S's. \n\nThis would require b-1 to be the least common multiple of ten different S(S-1) terms. \n\nThe minimal LCM of S(S-1) for S=2 to11 is LCM(2,6,12,20,30,42,56,72,90,110). \n\nCalculating LCM of these:\n\nFactors:\n\n2=2\n\n6=2\u00d73\n\n12=2\u00b2\u00d73\n\n20=2\u00b2\u00d75\n\n30=2\u00d73\u00d75\n\n42=2\u00d73\u00d77\n\n56=2\u00b3\u00d77\n\n72=2\u00b3\u00d73\u00b2\n\n90=2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75\n\n110=2\u00d75\u00d711\n\nThus LCM is 2\u00b3\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75\u00d77\u00d711=8\u00d79\u00d75\u00d77\u00d711= 8\u00d79=72, 72\u00d75=360, 360\u00d77=2520, 2520\u00d711=27720. \n\nThus, b=27721. \n\nThis is way too large, so likely not the answer. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps I should consider that the minimal b is 211 (k=210). \n\n210 has prime factors2,3,5,7. \n\nThus, 2^4=16 solutions. \n\nThe interval sqrt(211)=14.5 \u219215 to210. \n\nThus, the solutions would be S= ?\n\nLet me compute them. \n\nPrime factors of210=2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77. \n\nCoprime factorizations: \n\nEach prime can be assigned to d1 or d2. \n\nThus, there are 16 coprime factorizations. \n\nLet me list them:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d1,d2) where d1*d2=210 and gcd(d1,d2)=1:\n\n(1,210),(2,105),(3,70),(5,42),(6,35),(7,30),(10,21),(14,15),\n\nand their reverses. \n\nTotal 8 pairs, but since ordered pairs, it's 16. \n\nWait no, the coprime factorizations are unordered pairs with order considered. \n\nActually, the coprime ordered pairs are 2^4=16. \n\nLet me proceed:\n\nFor each subset of primes assigned to d1:\n\n1. d1=1: d2=210. \n\nS\u22610 mod1 and1 mod210 \u2192S=1 mod210 \u2192S=1 (too low). \n\n2. d1=2: d2=105. \n\nS\u22610 mod2 and1 mod105. \n\nS=2a\u22611 mod105 \u21922a\u22611 mod105 \u2192a\u226153 mod105 (2\u00d753=106\u22611 mod105). \n\nThus a=53 \u2192S=106. \n\n3. d1=3: d2=70. \n\nS\u22610 mod3 and1 mod70. \n\nS=3a\u22611 mod70 \u21923a\u22611 mod70 \u2192a\u226147 mod70 (3\u00d747=141\u22611 mod70). \n\na=47 \u2192S=141. \n\n4. d1=5: d2=42. \n\nS\u22610 mod5 and1 mod42. \n\nS=5a\u22611 mod42 \u21925a\u22611 mod42 \u2192a\u226113 mod42 (5\u00d713=65\u226165-42=23 mod42.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is first. \n\nThe problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if it has exactly two digits when written in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. \n\nAlright, so first, let's parse the requirements for a number n to be b-eautiful:\n\n1. It must have exactly two digits in base b. That means n is between b^1 (which is b) and b^2 - 1. Because in base b, the first two-digit number is 10_b (which is b in decimal) and the last two-digit number is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 -1. \n\n2. The sum of its two digits in base b must equal the square root of n. Let me denote the two digits as d1 and d0 (where d1 is the first digit, so it can't be zero). So, d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). \n\nSince n is a two-digit number in base b, we can write n as d1 * b + d0. \n\nSo putting these together, the equation we have is:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(n) = sqrt(d1 * b + d0)\n\nSo, we need to find all pairs (d1, d0) where d1 is from 1 to b-1, and d0 from 0 to b-1, such that d1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0). \n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such pairs (d1, d0) exceeds 10. \n\nHmm, okay. Let me formalize this equation. Let me denote S = d1 + d0, which is supposed to be equal to sqrt(n). Since n = d1*b + d0, then S = sqrt(d1*b + d0). Squaring both sides, we get:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nBut since S = d1 + d0, substitute S:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a better way to handle this. Let me try to express in terms of d1 and d0. Let's see:\n\nWe have (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation as:\n\nd1*b = (d1 + d0)^2 - d0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express d0 in terms of d1 and S. Wait, S is d1 + d0, so d0 = S - d1. Substitute that into the equation S^2 = d1*b + d0:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + (S - d1) \n\nSo, S^2 = d1*(b - 1) + S \n\nThen, moving terms around:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S \n\nTherefore,\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, this seems more manageable. Since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1 (since it's the first digit in base b), the right-hand side must be an integer, and d1 must satisfy 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1. Similarly, since d0 = S - d1 must also be between 0 and b-1 (since it's a digit in base b). So, we can use this equation to find possible S values for a given b, then check the constraints on d1 and d0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible S, we can find the possible b's where this holds. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, note that S must be an integer because sqrt(n) must be an integer (since the sum of two integers is an integer, so sqrt(n) must be integer). Therefore, n must be a perfect square, and S must be the square root of n. So, S is an integer, and n = S^2. \n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + d0, and S = d1 + d0. \n\nSo, substituting d0 = S - d1 into the first equation:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + (S - d1)\n\n=> S^2 = d1*(b - 1) + S\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\nd1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S\n\nTherefore,\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/(b - 1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer, (S^2 - S) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, since d1 must be between 1 and b-1, inclusive, we can write:\n\n1 \u2264 (S^2 - S)/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n\nTherefore,\n\n1 \u2264 (S(S - 1))/(b - 1) \u2264 b - 1\n\nLet me denote that as:\n\n(S(S - 1))/(b - 1) \u2265 1 and \u2264 b -1\n\nSo,\n\nS(S - 1) \u2265 (b - 1) and S(S - 1) \u2264 (b - 1)^2\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, we can find all possible S such that (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b-1), and then check if the resulting d1 and d0 are valid digits (i.e., d1 between 1 and b-1, d0 between 0 and b-1, and d0 = S - d1). \n\nAlternatively, since n = S^2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b and b^2 -1. Therefore, S^2 must be in [b, b^2 -1]. Since S is sqrt(n), so S must be between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b^2 -1). Since sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so S is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]. Because S must be an integer. \n\nWait, sqrt(n) must be at least sqrt(b), since n is at least b. So S \u2265 sqrt(b). But S must also be an integer. So S can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1? Wait, but n can be as big as b^2 -1, so sqrt(n) can be as big as sqrt(b^2 -1) \u2248 b, so S can be up to b -1 (since sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so the maximum integer S is b -1). \n\nTherefore, S ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b -1. \n\nHmm. \n\nSo for each b, we can consider S in that range, and check whether (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b -1). If so, then compute d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1). Then check if d1 is between 1 and b-1, and then check if d0 = S - d1 is between 0 and b-1. \n\nAlternatively, since once d1 is computed, d0 is determined as S - d1, so we just need to check that d0 is between 0 and b-1. \n\nWait, but d0 must also be a non-negative integer. Since d0 = S - d1, and d1 is at least 1, so S - d1 must be at least 0. So S \u2265 d1. But since d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1), so substituting that in, we need S \u2265 (S^2 - S)/(b -1). \n\nHmm, maybe this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to think of another approach. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, for a given b, let me consider all possible two-digit numbers in base b. Each such number is n = d1*b + d0, with 1 \u2264 d1 \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b-1. The condition is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). Therefore, sqrt(n) must be an integer, so n must be a perfect square. Let me denote S = sqrt(n). Then n = S^2, so S must satisfy S = d1 + d0, and S^2 = d1*b + d0. \n\nTherefore, substituting d0 = S - d1 into the second equation:\n\nS^2 = d1*b + (S - d1) => S^2 = d1*(b -1) + S \n\nTherefore,\n\nd1*(b - 1) = S^2 - S \n\nSo,\n\nd1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, inclusive, the numerator must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be within that range. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-beautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers S such that:\n\n1. S^2 is a two-digit number in base b (i.e., b \u2264 S^2 \u2264 b^2 -1)\n\n2. (S^2 - S) is divisible by (b -1)\n\n3. The resulting d1 = (S^2 - S)/(b -1) must be an integer between 1 and b-1\n\n4. Then d0 = S - d1 must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, we can iterate over possible S values, check these conditions, and count the number of valid (d1, d0) pairs. \n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10. \n\nHmm. Since this might be tedious to do manually for all b, maybe there is a pattern or formula here. Let me see if I can find a way to express the number of solutions for a given b in terms of S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can express S in terms of b. Let me see:\n\nStarting from d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer, so (S\u00b2 - S) must be divisible by (b -1). Let me denote (b -1) divides (S\u00b2 - S). So, (S\u00b2 - S) mod (b -1) = 0. \n\nTherefore, (S\u00b2 - S) \u2261 0 mod (b -1). \n\nSo, S(S -1) \u2261 0 mod (b -1). \n\nTherefore, the product of two consecutive integers S and S-1 must be divisible by (b -1). Since S and S-1 are coprime (consecutive integers), this implies that (b -1) must divide the product S(S -1). \n\nHence, (b -1) must be a factor of S(S -1). Since S and S-1 are coprime, the factors of (b -1) must be distributed between S and S-1. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the possible S's are those integers where (b -1) divides S(S -1). \n\nMoreover, S must be such that S^2 is in the range [b, b^2 -1], so S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)). Since sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so S can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1. \n\nSo for each b, the number of solutions is the number of integers S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b -1) divides S(S -1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can rephrase this as:\n\nLet k = b -1. Then, we need to find the number of S in [ceil(sqrt(k +1)), k] such that k divides S(S -1). \n\nHmm, perhaps this substitution could help. Let me try.\n\nLet me set k = b -1, so b = k +1. Then S ranges from ceil(sqrt(k+1)) up to k. \n\nWe need S(S -1) \u2261 0 mod k. \n\nSo, for each k (where k = b -1 \u22651 since b \u22652), the number of S in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that S(S -1) \u22610 mod k. \n\nWe need to find the smallest k +1 (since b = k+1) such that the number of such S exceeds 10. \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the minimal k where the count is >10, then adding 1 to get b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of possible values of k (starting from small k) and compute the number of S for each. \n\nBut since the problem is asking for the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, maybe we can look for when the number of divisors or factors of k allows for more solutions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of S and S-1 as numbers such that one of them is divisible by k, or their factors multiply to cover k. Since S and S-1 are coprime, so if k divides S(S -1), then k must divide either S or S-1, or be split between them. \n\nWait, since S and S-1 are coprime, any prime factor of k must divide either S or S-1, but not both. Therefore, the factors of k can be partitioned between S and S-1. \n\nTherefore, the equation S(S -1) \u22610 mod k implies that k divides S(S-1). Since gcd(S, S-1)=1, then k must divide either S or S-1. Wait, actually, not necessarily. Wait, if k divides S(S-1), and gcd(S, S-1)=1, then k must divide S or k divides S-1? Not exactly. For example, suppose k is a product of two coprime numbers, say a and b, where a divides S and b divides S-1. Since a and b are coprime, then k divides S(S-1). \n\nSo, in general, k can be written as a product of factors where one factor divides S and another divides S-1, but since they are coprime, the factors must be coprime. \n\nThis is getting a bit abstract. Maybe it's better to think numerically. Let me try to compute the number of S for some b and see when it crosses 10. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Let me see:\n\nWe have d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1). Since d1 must be between 1 and b-1, then (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1. So S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2. \n\nAlso, since d1 must be at least 1, (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u22651 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S \u2265 (b -1). \n\nTherefore, for each S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], we can check if S\u00b2 - S is divisible by (b -1). \n\nAlternatively, rearranged:\n\nLet me consider that for each S, (S\u00b2 - S) must be divisible by (b-1). So (b-1) divides (S(S -1)). \n\nTherefore, for a given S, possible (b-1) must be a divisor of S(S -1). So for each S, the possible values of (b-1) are the divisors of S(S -1). Therefore, if we fix S, then (b-1) can be any divisor of S(S-1), and then b = (divisor) +1. \n\nBut since we want to count for each b the number of S such that (b-1) divides S(S -1) and S is in the required range, perhaps this is more complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can parameterize in terms of S. Let me see.\n\nSuppose for a given S, the number of b's for which b-1 divides S(S-1) and b is in the range where S is within [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]. Hmm, maybe not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each S, the possible b's are such that b-1 divides S(S-1), and b is between S^2/(b^2) ??? Hmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let's try to consider that for each S, the possible b's are divisors of S(S-1) plus 1, but constrained so that S is within the required range for b. \n\nThis seems too vague. Let me instead think of an example. Let's try small values of b and see how many b-eautiful numbers there are, then look for when it exceeds 10. \n\nStarting with b=2:\n\nFor b=2, two-digit numbers in base 2 are from 2 (10_2) up to 3 (11_2). So n can be 2 or 3.\n\nCheck each:\n\nFor n=2: digits are 1 and 0. Sum is 1+0=1. sqrt(2)\u22481.414, not integer. Not beautiful.\n\nFor n=3: digits 1 and 1. Sum is 2. sqrt(3)\u22481.732, not integer. Not beautiful.\n\nSo, 0 b-beautiful numbers for b=2.\n\nb=3:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base3: from 3 (10_3) to 8 (22_3).\n\nPossible n must be perfect squares. The squares in this range are 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2) but 9 is 100_3 which is three digits, so only 4.\n\nCheck n=4:\n\n4 in base3 is 11_3. Digits 1 and 1. Sum is 2. sqrt(4)=2. So 2=2. So yes, it's 3-eautiful. \n\nSo count is 1.\n\nb=4:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base4: 4 (10_4) to 15 (33_4).\n\nSquares in this range: 4 (2^2), 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2) which is 100_4 (three digits). So 4, 9.\n\nCheck n=4: 10_4. Digits 1 and 0. Sum 1. sqrt(4)=2. Not equal. Not beautiful.\n\nn=9: 21_4. Digits 2 and1. Sum 3. sqrt(9)=3. So yes. \n\nAnother square is 16 but it's three digits. So only 9. Count is 1.\n\nHmm, same as before. \n\nb=5:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base5: 5 to 24.\n\nSquares in range: 9 (3^2), 16 (4^2), 25 (5^2) which is three digits. So 9, 16.\n\nCheck n=9: 14_5 (1*5 +4=9). Sum 1+4=5. sqrt(9)=3. Not equal. \n\nWait, that can't be. Wait 14_5 is 1*5 +4 =9, so digits 1 and4. Their sum is 5, which is not 3. So not beautiful.\n\nn=16: 31_5 (3*5 +1=16). Sum is 3+1=4. sqrt(16)=4. So yes. \n\nSo count is 1.\n\nHmm, still 1. \n\nb=6:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base6: 6-35.\n\nSquares: 9, 16, 25, 36 (but 36 is 100_6). So up to 25.\n\nCheck each square:\n\nn=9: 13_6 (1*6+3=9). Sum 1+3=4 vs sqrt(9)=3. No.\n\nn=16: 24_6 (2*6+4=16). Sum 2+4=6 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.\n\nn=25: 41_6 (4*6 +1=25). Sum 4+1=5 vs sqrt(25)=5. Yes. So count=1.\n\nb=7:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from 7 to 48.\n\nSquares: 9,16,25,36,49 (but 49 is 100_7, so up to 36).\n\nCheck n=9: 12_7 (1*7+2=9). Sum 1+2=3 vs sqrt(9)=3. Yes.\n\nn=16: 22_7 (2*7+2=16). Sum 2+2=4 vs sqrt(16)=4. Yes.\n\nn=25: 34_7 (3*7 +4=25). Sum 3+4=7 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.\n\nn=36: 51_7 (5*7+1=36). Sum 5+1=6 vs sqrt(36)=6. Yes.\n\nSo total here: 3 (n=9,16,36). So count=3.\n\nOkay, so for b=7, there are 3 b-eautiful numbers. \n\nContinuing, maybe this is going to take a while, but perhaps there's a pattern here. Let me see if I can find a formula or a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can model the equation:\n\nWe have d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1). Since d1 must be between 1 and b-1, so:\n\n1 \u2264 (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nMultiply all terms by (b -1):\n\n(b -1) \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me consider the left inequality first:\n\nS\u00b2 - S \u2265 (b -1)\n\nThe right inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me rearrange both inequalities.\n\nLeft inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 - S - (b -1) \u22650 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - b +1 \u22650.\n\nRight inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 - S - (b -1)^2 \u22640 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - (b\u00b2 - 2b +1) \u22640 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - b\u00b2 + 2b -1 \u22640.\n\nHmm. Not sure if this helps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express b in terms of S. Let me see:\n\nFrom the equation d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1), and since d1 must be \u2264 b-1,\n\n(S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - (b -1)^2 \u22640.\n\nBut solving for b here might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, let's think in terms of S and see for each S, possible b's. Let me consider that for a given S, the possible b's must satisfy that (b -1) divides S(S -1). Also, since n = S\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, which requires that b \u2264 S\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1. \n\nTherefore, b must satisfy b \u2264 S\u00b2 and S\u00b2 < b\u00b2. \n\nSo sqrt(S\u00b2) = S < b \u2264 S\u00b2. Therefore, b must be in (S, S\u00b2]. Wait, but since b has to be an integer greater than S, so b must be from S+1 to S\u00b2. \n\nWait, but since n = S\u00b2 must be two-digit in base b, so n < b\u00b2. Since n = S\u00b2, that gives S\u00b2 < b\u00b2 \u2192 b > S. So the range for b is S+1 \u2264 b \u2264 S\u00b2. \n\nBut also, since the two-digit number in base b must be at least b, so S\u00b2 \u2265 b. \n\nTherefore, combining these, for a given S, the possible b's are integers from max(S+1, ...) up to S\u00b2, but also such that (b -1) divides S(S -1). \n\nThis seems a bit involved, but maybe we can think of for each S, the possible b's are divisors of S(S-1) plus 1, lying in the interval (S, S\u00b2].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each S, the number of b's is equal to the number of divisors of S(S-1) that are in (S, S\u00b2], then adding 1? Not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of trying to find the count for each b, let's see for each S, how many b's can be formed such that (b-1) divides S(S-1) and b is in (S, S\u00b2]. Then, for each b, the number of S's would be the number of S's for which b-1 divides S(S-1) and S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. \n\nThis seems too tangled. Maybe going back to the original approach of trying to compute counts for increasing b until we reach over 10. \n\nLet me try to proceed step by step for each b. Let's see.\n\nContinuing from where I left off:\n\nb=7 had 3 numbers. Let me try b=8:\n\nb=8:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base8: 8 to 63.\n\nSquares in that range: 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64 (but 64 is 100_8, so up to 49).\n\nCheck each square:\n\nn=9: 11_8 (1+1=2 vs sqrt(9)=3). No.\n\nn=16: 20_8 (2+0=2 vs 4). No.\n\nn=25: 31_8 (3+1=4 vs 5). No.\n\nn=36: 44_8 (4+4=8 vs 6). No.\n\nn=49: 61_8 (6+1=7 vs 7). Yes. So only 49. So count=1?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, let me check each:\n\nWait, n=9: 11_8 is 1*8+1=9. Sum is 2, which is not 3. Not.\n\nn=16: 20_8 (2*8 +0=16). Sum is 2, but sqrt(16)=4. Not.\n\nn=25: 31_8 (3*8 +1=25). Sum 4 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.\n\nn=36: 44_8 (4*8+4=36). Sum 8 vs sqrt(36)=6. Not.\n\nn=49: 61_8 (6*8+1=49). Sum 7 vs sqrt(49)=7. Yes. \n\nSo only one. So total is 1? Hmm, but in base8, 49 is valid. Wait, so total is 1. Hmm, okay.\n\nWait, but maybe I missed another square?\n\nWait 64 is excluded, so 49 is the last. So yes, only 49. So count=1.\n\nHmm, so b=7 had 3, b=8 has 1. \n\nContinuing.\n\nb=9:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base9: 9 to 80.\n\nSquares in range: 9,16,25,36,49,64,81 (but 81 is 100_9, so up to 64).\n\nCheck each:\n\nn=9: 10_9 (1+0=1 vs 3). No.\n\nn=16: 17_9 (1+7=8 vs 4). No.\n\nn=25: 27_9 (2+7=9 vs 5). No.\n\nn=36: 40_9 (4+0=4 vs 6). No.\n\nn=49: 54_9 (5+4=9 vs7). No.\n\nn=64: 71_9 (7+1=8 vs8). 7+1=8, sqrt(64)=8. Yes. So 64 is valid. \n\nSo count=1.\n\nHmm, okay.\n\nb=10:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base10: 10 to 99.\n\nSquares in this range: 16,25,..., 100 (but 100 is three digits, so up to 81, 100 excluded).\n\nWait, squares from 4^2=16 up to 9^2=81, and 10^2=100 excluded.\n\nSo squares: 16,25,36,49,64,81.\n\nCheck each:\n\nn=16: 16 in base10 is 16, which is two digits. The digits sum 1+6=7 vs sqrt(16)=4. No.\n\nWait, digits are 1 and 6? Wait in base10, 16 is '1' and '6', sum 7. Not equal to 4. \n\nn=25: digits 2+5=7 vs sqrt(25)=5. No.\n\nn=36: 3+6=9 vs6. No.\n\nn=49: 4+9=13 vs7. No.\n\nn=64: 6+4=10 vs8. No.\n\nn=81: 8+1=9 vs9. Yes. \n\nSo only 81. So count=1.\n\nHmm, so b=10:1.\n\nHmm, not increasing yet. \n\nWait, maybe higher b?\n\nLet me try b=13 as in the example:\n\nb=13:\n\nThe example says 81 is 13-beautiful. Let me check:\n\n81 in base13: 6*13 +3=78+3=81. So digits 6 and3. Sum 9, sqrt(81)=9. Correct. \n\nOther squares:\n\nLet me see the squares between 13 and 13^2 -1=168. So squares up to 12^2=144, 13^2=169 excluded.\n\nSo squares: 16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144.\n\nCheck each:\n\nn=16: 13: 16 in base13 is 13+3=1*13 +3 \u2192 digits 1 and3. Sum 4 vs sqrt(16)=4. Yes! So 16 is also beautiful here.\n\nWait, so let me check:\n\n16: base13 is 13 + 3? Wait 1*13 +3 =16, yes. So digits 1 and3. 1+3=4, which is sqrt(16)=4. So yes. So that's another one.\n\nn=25: in base13 is 1C (since 1*13 +12=25). But digits are 1 and 12 (which is 'C'). The sum is 1+12=13 vs sqrt(25)=5. Not. \n\nWait, but digits must be numbers, so in base13, digits go from 0-12. So 25 is 1 and 12 (since 1*13 +12=25). Sum is 13, not 5. \n\nn=36: in base13: 2*13 +10=26+10=36. So digits 2 and10. Sum 12 vs sqrt(36)=6. Not.\n\nn=49: 3*13 + 10=39+10=49. Wait, 3*13=39, so 49-39=10. So digits 3 and10. Sum 13 vs7. No.\n\nAlternatively, 49 in base13: 3*13 +10=49, yes. Sum 13 vs7. No.\n\nn=64: 4*13 +12=52 +12=64. So digits 4 and12. Sum 16 vs8. 16 vs8. Not.\n\nn=81: 6*13 +3=81. As in the example. Sum 9 vs9. Yes.\n\nn=100: 7*13 +9=91+9=100. Digits 7 and9. Sum16 vs10. Not.\n\nn=121: 9*13 +4=117+4=121. Sum9+4=13 vs11. Not.\n\nn=144: 11*13 +1=143+1=144. Sum11+1=12 vs12. Wait sqrt(144)=12. So digits 11 and1. Sum 12. So yes! \n\nSo 144 is also beautiful here. \n\nSo total for b=13: \n\n16 (digits 1+3=4), 81 (6+3=9), 144 (11+1=12). Wait, sqrt(144)=12, so yes. \n\nWait, are there more?\n\nLet me check n=25, 36, etc. \n\nWait let me recount:\n\n16: yes.\n\n25: no.\n\n36: no.\n\n49: no.\n\n64: no.\n\n81: yes.\n\n100: no.\n\n121: no.\n\n144: yes.\n\nWait, what about n= 49: 3+10=13 vs7. Not. \n\nWait, n= 121: 9 +4=13 vs11. Not. \n\nWait, 144: 11+1=12. sqrt(144)=12. Yes. \n\nSo total three numbers: 16,81,144. So count=3. But the example says 81 is one of them, so that's correct. \n\nWait, but maybe I missed others?\n\nWait let's check n= 25: no. What about n= 100? 7+9=16 vs10. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let's check n= 121: 9 and 4 gives 13 vs11. \n\nWait, is there another square? Let's see:\n\nWait 10^2=100, 11^2=121, 12^2=144. \n\nWait what about 1^2=1? Not two digits in base13. 2^2=4, same. Up to 3^2=9, still single digit. So only from 4^2=16 up. \n\nSo 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, 121,144. \n\nSo only three of them qualify. So count is 3. \n\nHmm, but the example mentions 81 as an example, so that's correct. \n\nHmm, so moving on. Maybe check higher b's. Let me try b=16:\n\nb=16:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base16 (hex) go from 16 (10) to 255 (FF).\n\nSquares up to 255: sqrt(255)\u224815.99, so squares up to 15\u00b2=225, 16\u00b2=256 excluded.\n\nSo squares from 4\u00b2=16 up to 15\u00b2=225.\n\nCheck each square:\n\nn=16: in base16 is 10. Digits 1 and0. Sum1 vs4. No.\n\nn=25: 19 (1*16 +9=25). Sum1+9=10 vs5. No.\n\nn=36: 24 (2*16 +4=36). Sum6 vs6. Wait 2+4=6. sqrt(36)=6. So yes.\n\nn=49: 31 (3*16+1=49). Sum4 vs7. 3+1=4 vs7. No.\n\nn=64: 40 (4*16+0=64). Sum4 vs8. No.\n\nn=81: 51 (5*16 +1=81). 5+1=6 vs9. No.\n\nn=100: 64 (6*16 +4=100). 6+4=10 vs10. sqrt(100)=10. So yes.\n\nn=121: 79 (7*16 +9=121). 7+9=16 vs11. No.\n\nn=144: 90 (9*16 +0=144). 9+0=9 vs12. No.\n\nn=169: A9 (10*16 +9=169). 10+9=19 vs13. No.\n\nWait, 13\u00b2=169. So digits A (10) and 9. Sum 19 vs13. No.\n\nn=196: C4 (12*16 +4=196). 12+4=16 vs14. No.\n\nn=225: E1 (14*16 +1=225). 14+1=15 vs15. sqrt(225)=15. So yes.\n\nSo the valid ones are:\n\n36 (24), 100 (64), 225 (E1). \n\nWait 36 is 24 in hex: digits 2 and4. Sum 6, sqrt(36)=6. \n\n100 in hex is 64 (digits 6 and4?), no wait 64 in decimal is 40 in hex. Wait no:\n\nWait n=100 decimal is 64 in hex? Wait no:\n\nWait 6*16 +4 = 100? 6*16=96 +4=100. Yes. So digits 6 and4. Sum 10, sqrt(100)=10. So yes.\n\nn=225 decimal is E1 in hex (14*16 +1=224+1=225). So digits 14 and1. Sum 15, sqrt(225)=15. So yes. \n\nThus total three numbers here. Hmm, so count=3 for b=16.\n\nHmm, not increasing. \n\nWait, maybe b=25? Let me try b=25.\n\nWait, this might take a while. Maybe we need a smarter approach.\n\nWait, let me think again of the equation:\n\nd1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1)\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1, so:\n\n1 \u2264 (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nWhich can be rewritten as:\n\n(b -1) \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me denote k = b -1, so:\n\nk \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 k\u00b2\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 - S \u2265 k \u2192 S\u00b2 - S -k \u22650,\n\nand S\u00b2 - S -k\u00b2 \u22640 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2.\n\nSo for given k, we can find S such that sqrt(k) \u2248 S, since S must be around sqrt(n)=sqrt(S\u00b2)=S, but n is in base b which is k+1. \n\nWait, perhaps S is roughly between sqrt(b) and b?\n\nAlternatively, the inequalities can be written as:\n\nS\u00b2 - S -k \u22650 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S \u2265k,\n\nand S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2.\n\nSo the value of S must satisfy both inequalities. Let me try to find S in terms of k.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that S is a variable and k is also a variable, and we need to find pairs (S, k) such that k is between S\u00b2 - S and (S\u00b2 - S)/1 (since k \u2264 S\u00b2 - S). Wait, no, the first inequality is k \u2264 S\u00b2 - S, and the second is S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2. So combining:\n\nk \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, for each S, k must be between sqrt(S\u00b2 - S) and S\u00b2 - S. Wait, perhaps this is better approached numerically.\n\nAlternatively, for a given S, the possible k (which is b-1) must satisfy k \u2264 S\u00b2 - S and k\u00b2 \u2265 S\u00b2 - S.\n\nSo k is between ceiling( sqrt(S\u00b2 - S) ) and S\u00b2 - S.\n\nWait, but also, since b must be greater than S (since n = S\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so b must be less than S\u00b2, but actually b must be greater than S because n = S\u00b2 must be at least b (since it's a two-digit number). So S\u00b2 \u2265 b \u2192 b \u2264 S\u00b2, but b must also be greater than S (since two-digit number requires b \u2264 n < b\u00b2). Wait, the two-digit number requires that b \u2264 n < b\u00b2. Since n = S\u00b2, so:\n\nb \u2264 S\u00b2 < b\u00b2 \u2192 sqrt(b) \u2264 S < b.\n\nTherefore, S must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nBut since b =k+1, then S must be in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k].\n\nHmm, this is getting too tangled again. Maybe let me think of S and k such that:\n\nk divides S(S-1),\n\nand k is between S and S\u00b2 - S (from the inequalities above). Wait, perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for each S, the possible k (b-1) must divide S(S-1), and k must be between S and S\u00b2 (since b must be between S+1 and S\u00b2). \n\nWait, since k = b-1, so b =k +1 must satisfy S+1 \u2264k+1 \u2264 S\u00b2 \u2192 S \u2264k \u2264 S\u00b2 -1.\n\nTherefore, k must be between S and S\u00b2 -1.\n\nThus, for a given S, the number of valid k (i.e., b-1) is equal to the number of divisors of S(S-1) that lie between S and S\u00b2 -1, inclusive.\n\nTherefore, the total number of b's for which there exists an S such that b-1 divides S(S-1), and b is in (S, S\u00b2], and S is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nBut this seems too convoluted. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is equal to the number of S such that S(S-1) is divisible by (b-1), and S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the count is the number of integers S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where (b-1) divides S(S-1). \n\nTherefore, perhaps to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, we need to find when the number of divisors of (b-1) in a certain range allows for more than 10 solutions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of b-1 as a number that has many factors, so that there are many S such that S(S-1) is divisible by (b-1). \n\nFor example, if b-1 is a highly composite number, then perhaps there are more S values. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of choosing b-1 to be 12, which has divisors 1,2,3,4,6,12. Maybe testing b=13 (as before) gives 3 numbers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps when b-1 is a factorial or something? \n\nAlternatively, let's think of S(S-1) must be divisible by (b-1). Since S and S-1 are coprime, then (b-1) must divide the product S(S-1), so (b-1) must be a factor that can be split between S and S-1. \n\nSuppose (b-1) divides S(S-1). Let me consider that (b-1) is equal to d1*d2, where d1 divides S and d2 divides (S-1), with gcd(d1,d2)=1. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions S for a given b-1 is equal to the number of ways to factor b-1 into two coprime factors d1 and d2, such that d1 divides S and d2 divides (S-1), and then S must satisfy certain congruence conditions. \n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps for each factorization of (b-1) into d1*d2 where gcd(d1,d2)=1, there is a unique S modulo (b-1) that satisfies S \u22610 mod d1 and S \u22611 mod d2. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions S in [1, b-1] is equal to the number of such factorizations. But we need S to be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1]. \n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions would be roughly the number of coprime factor pairs of (b-1). \n\nHence, if (b-1) has many coprime factor pairs, then the count would be higher. \n\nTherefore, to have more than 10 solutions, we need (b-1) to have more than 10 coprime factor pairs. \n\nThe number of coprime factor pairs of a number n is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of n. Because each prime can be assigned to either d1 or d2, but since d1 and d2 must be coprime, each prime factor must go entirely to one or the other. \n\nWait, actually, the number of ways to split the prime factors into two coprime factors (d1,d2) with d1*d2 = n is 2^{number of prime factors of n}. Because for each prime, you decide whether it goes to d1 or d2. However, since (d1,d2) and (d2,d1) are considered the same if order doesn't matter, but in our case, since d1 divides S and d2 divides (S-1), the order matters because S mod d1 is 0 and S mod d2 is1. \n\nTherefore, each coprime pair (d1,d2) with d1*d2 =n gives a unique solution S modulo n. So the number of solutions S in [1, n] is exactly the number of coprime factorizations of n into d1*d2. Since each coprime pair gives a unique solution. \n\nThus, the number of solutions S in [1, n] is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of n. However, since d1 and d2 can be swapped (since (d1,d2) and (d2,d1) are different factorizations but lead to different congruence conditions), but actually, if we consider ordered pairs, then it's 2^{k}. But since d1 and d2 are ordered (since d1 divides S and d2 divides S-1), so each coprime pair (d1,d2) where d1*d2 =n gives a unique solution. \n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions S mod n is equal to the number of coprime ordered pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2 =n. Which is indeed 2^{k}, since for each prime, you choose whether it goes to d1 or d2. \n\nHowever, each such pair gives a unique solution S modulo n. Therefore, in the range [1, n], there are exactly 2^{k} solutions. \n\nBut in our problem, we are only interested in S in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] (since S must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 S < b). \n\nTherefore, the total number of valid S is equal to the number of solutions S in that interval. \n\nSince the total number of solutions modulo n is 2^{k}, but spread out over the interval, perhaps roughly half of them would be in the upper half (since S needs to be up to b-1). \n\nWait, but if n = b-1, then the solutions S are spread across 0 to n. So the total number is 2^{k}. So to have more than 10 solutions, we need 2^{k} > 20 (since half might be in the required interval). \n\nWait, perhaps this is getting somewhere. \n\nSuppose n = b-1 has k distinct prime factors, then the number of coprime factorizations is 2^{k}. Each such factorization corresponds to a solution S in [1, n]. \n\nBut we need S to be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), n]. Since b =n+1, so sqrt(b) \u2248 sqrt(n+1). \n\nThe interval [ceil(sqrt(n+1)), n] is roughly from sqrt(n) to n. The total number of solutions is 2^{k}. \n\nTherefore, if 2^{k} exceeds 2*10=20, then maybe half would be in the required interval. \n\nWait, but maybe not exactly half. \n\nAlternatively, if n is large enough, the number of solutions in the interval might be approximately half of 2^{k}. \n\nTherefore, to have more than 10 solutions, we need 2^{k} > 20 \u2192 k \u22655 (since 2^4=16 <20, 2^5=32>20). \n\nTherefore, if n has at least 5 distinct prime factors, then the number of solutions could be over 10. \n\nTherefore, the minimal n (which is b-1) with at least 5 distinct prime factors would be the product of first 5 primes: 2*3*5*7*11=2310. But that's way too big. \n\nAlternatively, maybe n can have exponents on primes but still have 5 distinct primes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps even with fewer prime factors but some exponents, the number of coprime factor pairs can be higher? Wait no, the number of coprime factor pairs only depends on the number of distinct primes. Because for coprime factors, each prime must be entirely in one factor or the other, so the number of coprime ordered factorizations is indeed 2^k where k is the number of distinct primes. \n\nTherefore, to have 2^{k} > 20, we need k \u22655. \n\nTherefore, the minimal n (b-1) with 5 distinct prime factors is 2*3*5*7*11=2310, so b=2311. But that's way too big. The example with b=13 (n=12) has k=2 (primes 2 and3), so 2^2=4 solutions, but in reality we only found 3 solutions. Hmm, discrepancy here. \n\nWait, let me check with b=13 (n=12). The number of coprime factorizations of 12 into d1*d2 where gcd(d1,d2)=1. \n\nThe prime factors of 12 are 2^2*3. So the distinct primes are 2 and3. Thus, k=2. So number of coprime ordered factorizations is 2^2=4. \n\nIndeed:\n\nThe coprime factorizations of 12 into d1*d2 with gcd(d1,d2)=1:\n\nPossible assignments of primes:\n\n- 2 and3 can be assigned to d1 or d2.\n\nPossible options:\n\n1. Assign 2 to d1 and 3 to d2. Then d1 must be a multiple of 2 but not 3, and d2 must be a multiple of 3 but not 2. The factors would be d1=4 (since 2^2) and d2=3, so 4*3=12.\n\n2. Assign 2 to d1 and 3 to d2, but d1 could also be 2 and d2=6, but wait 6 and 2 are not coprime. Wait no, must be coprime. \n\nWait, actually, the coprime factorizations require that d1 and d2 are coprime and multiply to 12. \n\nThe coprime pairs (d1, d2) with d1*d2=12:\n\n(1,12), (3,4), (4,3), (12,1). \n\nWait, but 3 and4 are coprime, 4 and3, etc. Also 1 and12 are coprime. \n\nThus, there are four coprime ordered pairs. \n\nIndeed, 2^2=4. \n\nHowever, in the case of b=13 (n=12), the number of solutions S is 3. \n\nWait, why the discrepancy? Because some of the solutions might fall outside the required interval [ceil(sqrt(13)), 12]. \n\nThe interval here is sqrt(13)\u22483.605, so ceil is 4 to 12. \n\nThe four solutions S would be the solutions to the congruences for each coprime pair. Let me find them:\n\nFor each coprime pair (d1, d2):\n\n1. (1,12): Solve S \u22610 mod1 and S \u22611 mod12. Since mod1 is always true, so S\u22611 mod12. The solution in [1,12] is S=1. But 1 is less than 4, so not counted.\n\n2. (3,4): Solve S \u22610 mod3 and S\u22611 mod4.\n\nFind S \u22610 mod3 and S\u22611 mod4.\n\nLet S=3k. Then 3k \u22611 mod4 \u2192 3k\u22611 mod4 \u2192 k\u22613 mod4. So k=3,7,11,... So S=9, 21,... but within 1-12, S=9.\n\n3. (4,3): Solve S\u22610 mod4 and S\u22611 mod3.\n\nS=4m. 4m \u22611 mod3 \u2192 m\u22611 mod3. So m=1,4,7,10 \u2192 S=4,16,... but within 1-12: 4 and 16 is out. So S=4 and 10 (4*2.5? Wait 4*1=4, 4*4=16>12. So S=4 and 10? Wait 4m \u22611 mod3. \n\nWait let's compute:\n\n4m \u22611 mod3 \u2192 4 \u22611 mod3, so 4m \u2261m mod3 \u22611 mod3 \u2192 m\u22611 mod3. So m=1,4,7,10.\n\nThus, S=4*1=4, 4*4=16 (too big). So only S=4. \n\nWait, but m=7 gives 4*7=28 which is over 12. Hmm, so only S=4 and S=10? Wait no, m=10 is 40 which is over. Wait, maybe I messed up.\n\nWait S must be \u226412. So m can be 1,4 (since 4*4=16>12). So S=4 and 16 is out. So only S=4.\n\nWait, but S=4: check 4 mod4 is 0, and 4 mod3 is 1? 4 mod3 is 1. Yes, 4 mod3=1. So yes, S=4 is a solution.\n\n4. (12,1): Solve S\u22610 mod12 and S\u22611 mod1. Since mod1 is trivial, S\u22610 mod12. The solution is 12. \n\nSo S=12. \n\nThus, the solutions S in [1,12] are 1,4,9,12. \n\nNow, considering the interval [4,12], we exclude S=1. So the valid S are 4,9,12. \n\nIndeed, as we saw earlier for b=13, the valid numbers were 16 (S=4: sqrt(16)=4), 81 (S=9), and 144 (S=12). So three solutions. \n\nThus, the total solutions are 4, but only 3 are in the required interval. \n\nTherefore, the formula 2^k gives the total solutions in [1,n], but we have to subtract those below ceil(sqrt(b)). \n\nTherefore, to get more than 10 solutions in the interval, we need 2^k > 10 + the number of solutions below the lower bound. \n\nAssuming that sqrt(b) is roughly sqrt(n+1), and n is the number of factors, so sqrt(n+1) is small compared to n, maybe the majority of solutions are in the upper half. \n\nTherefore, if we have 2^k solutions, and we need more than 10 in the upper part, so if 2^k is at least 20 or so, then maybe 10 would be in the upper. \n\nSo, with k=4 (2^4=16), maybe that could give 8 solutions in the upper half, but still not enough. \n\nk=5 gives 32 solutions, so maybe 16 in the upper, which would exceed 10. \n\nTherefore, the minimal n (b-1) with 5 distinct prime factors would be the product of the first 5 primes: 2*3*5*7*11=2310, so b=2311. But that's way too big. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a number with fewer distinct primes but with exponents allows more solutions? Wait, but the number of coprime factor pairs only depends on the number of distinct primes, not their exponents. \n\nFor example, if n=12=2^2*3, it has 2 distinct primes, so 2^2=4 solutions. \n\nIf n=16=2^4, which has only 1 distinct prime, so 2^1=2 solutions. \n\nWait, let's check with n=6 (2*3), so k=2, 4 solutions. Let me see for b=7 (n=6):\n\nFor b=7, n=6 (b-1=6). The coprime factorizations of 6 are (1,6),(2,3),(3,2),(6,1). \n\nThe solutions S would be:\n\n1. (1,6): S\u22610 mod1 and 1 mod6 \u2192 S=1 mod6. Solutions in 1-6: 1,7, but 7>6 so only S=1.\n\n2. (2,3): S\u22610 mod2 and 1 mod3. Find S even and S\u22611 mod3.\n\nPossible S=4 (4 mod3=1). \n\n3. (3,2): S\u22610 mod3 and 1 mod2 (odd). S=3 mod2=1. So S=3.\n\n4. (6,1): S\u22610 mod6 \u2192 S=6.\n\nThus solutions S=1,4,3,6. \n\nThe interval is ceil(sqrt(7))=3, so S must be between 3 and6. \n\nThus valid S:3,4,6. \n\nIndeed, for b=7, we had 3 solutions: S=3 (n=9), S=4 (16), S=6 (36). Wait n= S\u00b2, so 3\u00b2=9, 4\u00b2=16,6\u00b2=36. \n\nYes, so 3 solutions. Which matches the count. \n\nTherefore, with k=2 (since 6 has two primes), 2^2=4 solutions, 3 in the interval. \n\nThus, to get over 10 solutions in the interval, we need 2^k sufficiently large. \n\nSuppose we take a number with 4 distinct primes, so 2^4=16 total solutions. Then, assuming half are in the upper half, that would give 8 solutions. Not enough. \n\nWith 5 primes: 32 solutions. Maybe 16 in the interval. So, b-1 must be the product of first 5 primes: 2*3*5*7*11=2310. So b=2311. But that seems too big. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smaller number with 5 distinct prime factors? The smallest such number is indeed 2310. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a number with exponents on primes but still having 4 primes? Wait, but with 4 primes, it's still 16 solutions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a different approach where the number of solutions is higher even with fewer primes. \n\nWait, perhaps if n is a factorial? Let me try n=12 (which is 2^2*3*1), but it's still two primes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe n=30 (2*3*5), which has 3 primes. Then 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nLet me test with n=30 (so b=31):\n\nThen the number of solutions S in [ceil(sqrt(31)),30]. sqrt(31)\u22485.56, so S from 6 to 30.\n\nThe number of solutions would be 2^3=8. Let's see if that's true.\n\nThe coprime factorizations of 30 (which is 2*3*5) into (d1,d2) are 2^3=8. Each combination of assigning primes to d1 or d2.\n\nFor example:\n\nPossible assignments:\n\nEach prime (2,3,5) can be assigned to d1 or d2.\n\nThus, the coprime factorizations are:\n\nd1=1, d2=30,\n\nd1=2, d2=15,\n\nd1=3, d2=10,\n\nd1=5, d2=6,\n\nd1=6, d2=5,\n\nd1=10, d2=3,\n\nd1=15, d2=2,\n\nd1=30, d2=1.\n\nTotal 8.\n\nEach of these gives a solution S in [1,30].\n\nLet's compute the solutions:\n\n1. (1,30): S \u22610 mod1 and 1 mod30 \u2192 S=1 mod30 \u2192 S=1 (too low).\n\n2. (2,15): S\u22610 mod2 and 1 mod15. \n\nFind S even and S\u22611 mod15.\n\nS=1 mod15 \u2192 1,16,31,\u2026 Within 1-30: 1 and16. S must be even: 16.\n\n3. (3,10): S\u22610 mod3 and 1 mod10.\n\nS\u22611 mod10 \u2192 1,11,21,31,\u2026 Within 1-30: 1,11,21.\n\nMust also be divisible by 3:\n\nCheck 1: 1 mod3\u22600 \u2192 no.\n\n11 mod3=2 \u2192 no.\n\n21 mod3=0 \u2192 yes. So S=21.\n\n4. (5,6): S\u22610 mod5 and 1 mod6.\n\nS\u22611 mod6 \u21921,7,13,19,25,31,\u2026 Within 1-30:1,7,13,19,25.\n\nMust also be divisible by5:\n\nCheck 5 divides 25. So S=25.\n\n5. (6,5): S\u22610 mod6 and 1 mod5.\n\nS\u22611 mod5 \u21921,6,11,16,21,26,\u2026 Within 1-30:1,6,11,16,21,26.\n\nMust also be divisible by6:\n\n6: 6 mod5=1? 6 mod5=1 \u2192 yes. So S=6.\n\n26 mod5=1? 26 mod5=1 \u2192 yes. 26 divisible by6? 26/6\u22484.33 \u2192 no. \n\nNext: 6 and 26? 6 is divisible by6. So S=6 and 26? Wait 26 isn't divisible by6. So only S=6.\n\nWait 6 mod5=1, yes. 6 is divisible by6. So S=6.\n\n6. (10,3): S\u22610 mod10 and 1 mod3.\n\nS\u22611 mod3 \u21921,4,7,10,13,\u2026 Within 1-30: multiples of10 plus those congruent to 1 mod3.\n\nWait S\u22610 mod10 \u2192 S=10,20,30.\n\nCheck which of these \u22611 mod3:\n\n10 mod3=1 \u2192 yes.\n\n20 mod3=2 \u2192 no.\n\n30 mod3=0 \u2192 no.\n\nThus S=10.\n\n7. (15,2): S\u22610 mod15 and 1 mod2.\n\nS\u22611 mod2 \u2192 odd.\n\nS must be multiple of15 and odd: 15,45,\u2026 Within 1-30:15.\n\n8. (30,1): S\u22610 mod30 \u2192 S=30.\n\nSo the solutions are S=1,16,21,25,6,10,15,30.\n\nNow, the interval is S from 6 to30 (since ceil(sqrt(31))=6). Excluding S=1. \n\nThus valid S:6,10,15,16,21,25,30. That's 7 solutions. \n\nHmm, but 2^3=8 solutions total, so 7 in the interval. \n\nThus, for b=31, there are 7 b-beautiful numbers. Still under 10. \n\nContinuing this way, for b=2*3*5*7=210 (so n=210, k=4 primes):\n\nThen the number of solutions would be 2^4=16. Let's see:\n\nThe interval would be ceil(sqrt(211))\u224815, so S from 15 to210.\n\nAssuming half the solutions are above sqrt(n+1), so maybe 8 solutions. \n\nBut let's see:\n\nAlternatively, let's try with n=210 (b=211):\n\nThe number of coprime factorizations is 2^4=16. \n\nIf we can assume that roughly half are in the upper half, that would give 8 solutions. Still under 10. \n\nHmm, so with 4 primes, we get 8 solutions. \n\nWith 5 primes, n=2310 (b=2311), we get 16 solutions in the upper half, which would be over 10. But this is a very large b. \n\nBut maybe there is a smarter number with fewer primes but more solutions. \n\nWait, perhaps if n is a square of a number with many factors?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n can be a power of 2? Let me see:\n\nTake n=16 (b=17). \n\nn=16=2^4. \n\nIt has only one distinct prime, so 2^1=2 solutions. \n\nIndeed, the coprime factorizations are (1,16) and (16,1). \n\nThe solutions S would be:\n\nFor (1,16): S=1 mod16 \u2192 S=1 (too low).\n\nFor (16,1): S=16. \n\nThus only S=16 is in the interval (ceil(sqrt(17))=5 to 16). So count=1. \n\nHmm, no good. \n\nAlternatively, n=24 (b=25). \n\nn=24 has prime factors 2^3*3, so two distinct primes. So 2^2=4 solutions. \n\nLet me compute them:\n\nCoprime factorizations:\n\n(1,24),(2,12),(3,8),(4,6),(6,4),(8,3),(12,2),(24,1). But need coprime pairs. \n\nWait coprime pairs must have gcd(d1,d2)=1. So:\n\nFactors must be coprime. \n\nLooking at factor pairs where gcd(d1,d2)=1:\n\n(1,24), gcd=1,\n\n(3,8), gcd=1,\n\n(8,3),\n\n(24,1),\n\n(2,12): gcd(2,12)=2\u22601,\n\n(4,6): gcd(4,6)=2\u22601,\n\n(6,4): same,\n\n(12,2): same,\n\n(3,8): already listed,\n\nSo the coprime factorizations are (1,24), (3,8), (8,3), (24,1). So four solutions.\n\nThus, solutions S:\n\nFor (1,24): S\u22611 mod24 \u2192 S=1 (too low).\n\nFor (3,8): S\u22610 mod3 and 1 mod8.\n\nFind S divisible by3 and S\u22611 mod8.\n\nLet S=3k. 3k\u22611 mod8 \u2192 3k\u22611 mod8 \u2192 k\u22613 mod8 (since 3*3=9\u22611 mod8). So k=3,11,\u2026 So S=9,33,\u2026 within 1-24: 9 and 33>24. So S=9.\n\nFor (8,3): S\u22610 mod8 and 1 mod3.\n\nS=8m. 8m \u22611 mod3 \u2192 8\u22612 mod3 \u2192 2m\u22611 mod3 \u2192 m\u22612 mod3 \u2192 m=2,5,8,\u2026 \n\nS=16,40,\u2026 Within 1-24:16 and 40>24. So S=16.\n\nFor (24,1): S\u22610 mod24 \u2192 S=24.\n\nThus solutions S=1,9,16,24. \n\nInterval is ceil(sqrt(25))=5 to24. Excluding S=1, we have 9,16,24. So 3 solutions. \n\nHmm, so even with two primes, the count is low. \n\nHmm, this suggests that to get over 10 solutions, we need at least 5 distinct prime factors, leading to b=2311, but maybe there is a smaller number with more solutions through some other means?\n\nWait, perhaps if n has multiple prime factors with exponents, but the number of coprime factorizations is still based on the distinct primes. So even with exponents, the coprime factorizations depend only on distinct primes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe n has repeated primes but arranged such that more solutions fall into the required interval. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find a b where the number of S is more than 10, even with fewer prime factors. Let's try with b= 2520, which is 2^3*3^2*5*7, but still four distinct primes. \n\nBut this is getting too large. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong and there's another way. \n\nWait let me try with b= 252 (which is 2^2*3^2*7). The number of distinct primes is 3 (2,3,7). So 2^3=8 solutions. Maybe in the interval, more solutions? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to find a b where the number of S is more than 10. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking back at the equation:\n\nWe have d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b-1). \n\nSince d1 must be between 1 and b-1, so:\n\n1 \u2264 (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nCross multiplying:\n\nb -1 \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me rearrange the first inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 - S \u2265 b -1 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - (b-1) \u22650\n\nThe second inequality:\n\nS\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S - (b-1)^2 \u22640\n\nTherefore, combining these inequalities:\n\nb -1 \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me denote k = b -1, so:\n\nk \u2264 S\u00b2 - S \u2264 k\u00b2\n\nTherefore,\n\nS\u00b2 - S -k \u22650,\n\nand S\u00b2 - S -k\u00b2 \u22640.\n\nSo for each k, we need to find S such that sqrt(k + S) ... Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, solving S\u00b2 - S -k \u22650 \u2192 S\u00b2 - S \u2265k,\n\nand S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2.\n\nLet me consider S is approximately sqrt(k\u00b2) =k, so when S is close to k, the terms might satisfy the inequalities.\n\nLet me consider S =k - m for some m. \n\nThen, substitute S =k - m into the inequalities:\n\nFirst inequality:\n\n(k -m)^2 - (k -m) \u2265k \u2192 k\u00b2 - 2km + m\u00b2 -k +m \u2265k \u2192k\u00b2 -2km +m\u00b2 -k +m -k \u22650 \u2192k\u00b2 -2km +m\u00b2 -2k +m \u22650.\n\nNot sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider S = sqrt(k). \n\nWait, let me think of possible S values in terms of k. \n\nSuppose S is about sqrt(k), then S\u00b2 - S would be around k, so the first inequality holds. The second inequality would require that S\u00b2 - S \u2264k\u00b2. Which is true because S is at most sqrt(k)\u00b2 =k. So maybe this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, think of S being between sqrt(k) and k. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions S is equal to the number of integers S in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)),k] such that S(S-1) is divisible by k. \n\nTherefore, for each k, count the number of S in that interval where k divides S(S-1). \n\nPerhaps I can find a k where this count exceeds 10. \n\nLet me try some larger k. Let me try k= 24 (so b=25):\n\nWait we did that earlier and got 3 solutions. \n\nk=60 (b=61):\n\nPrime factors of 60 are 2^2*3*5 \u2192 3 distinct primes. So 2^3=8 solutions. Let me see:\n\nThe interval is ceil(sqrt(61))\u22488, so S from 8 to60.\n\nNumber of solutions would be 8 total, but some may be in the interval. \n\nAlternatively, let me compute:\n\nThe coprime factorizations of 60 (2^2*3*5) are 2^3=8.\n\nSolutions S:\n\nLet me pick a factor pair, say (3,20). \n\nWait this is going to take time. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps try k= 120 (b=121). \n\nPrime factors of 120: 2^3*3*5 \u2192 three distinct primes. 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nStill not enough. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to try k= 210 (b=211):\n\nPrime factors 2*3*5*7 \u2192 four primes, so 2^4=16 solutions. \n\nAssuming half are in the interval, that would be 8. Still under 10. \n\nk= 420 (b=421):\n\nPrime factors 2^2*3*5*7 \u2192 four primes. Still four distinct primes. 2^4=16 solutions. \n\nHmm, so even with four primes, it's 16 total solutions, so maybe 8 in the interval. \n\nHmm, so maybe with five primes, which would be 32 solutions, leading to 16 in the interval. \n\nTherefore, the minimal k is the product of first five primes:2*3*5*7*11=2310. Thus b=2311. \n\nBut that's a very large b. However, the problem states to find the least integer b\u22652. Maybe there's a smarter way?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier assumption. Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose that for a given S, the number of b's such that b-1 divides S(S-1) and b is in (S, S\u00b2].\n\nTherefore, for each S, the number of such b's is equal to the number of divisors of S(S-1) that are between S and S\u00b2 -1. \n\nTherefore, the total number of b-eautiful numbers across all b is the sum over S of the number of such b's for each S. \n\nBut we need the first b where the count exceeds 10. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a particular S, there are many b's. \n\nWait, let's think of S= 10. Then S(S-1)=90. The divisors of 90 are many. \n\nLet me see:\n\nIf S=10, then S(S-1)=90. So for any b-1 dividing 90, and b must be between 10+1=11 and 10\u00b2=100. \n\nSo b-1 must be a divisor of90 between 10 and99. \n\nThe divisors of90 are:\n\n1,2,3,5,6,9,10,15,18,30,45,90.\n\nSo between10 and99:10,15,18,30,45,90. \n\nThus, b-1 can be 10,15,18,30,45,90 \u2192 b=11,16,19,31,46,91. \n\nEach of these b's will have S=10 as a solution. \n\nSo for each of these b's, there is at least one solution (S=10). \n\nSimilarly, for other S values, they can contribute to multiple b's. \n\nTherefore, the total number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is the number of S such that b-1 divides S(S-1) and S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. \n\nTo have more than 10 solutions for a particular b, we need many S's such that S(S-1) is divisible by (b-1). \n\nTherefore, if (b-1) is a number that divides many S(S-1) terms for S in the required range. \n\nPerhaps if (b-1) is 12 (as in the example with b=13). Let's see:\n\nFor b=13 (k=12), the divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. \n\nThe S's for which 12 divides S(S-1) must satisfy S(S-1) mod12=0. \n\nThis happens when either S\u22610 mod4 and S\u22610 mod3 (since 12=4*3), but more precisely, since S and S-1 are coprime, 12 must divide either S or S-1. \n\nWait, since gcd(S,S-1)=1, so 12 must divide S or divide S-1. \n\nTherefore, S \u22610 mod12 or S\u22611 mod12. \n\nThus, S can be 12 (which is within the interval up to b-1=12) or S=1 mod12. \n\nBut S must be \u2265 ceil(sqrt(13))\u22484. So S=1 mod12 within 4-12 would be S=13 mod12=1, but 1 is below 4. The next is S=13-12=1? Not. So only S=12 and S=4 (wait, maybe other conditions? \n\nWait, the previous analysis showed solutions at S=4,9,12. \n\nWait, perhaps my previous approach is better. \n\nAlternatively, to find the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, perhaps I can compute for b= 36:\n\nWait let's try b= 36 (k=35). \n\nWait 35 factors into 5*7. \n\nSo the coprime factorizations are (1,35),(5,7),(7,5),(35,1). \n\nThus four solutions. \n\nInterval: sqrt(36)=6, so S from6 to35.\n\nSolutions:\n\nFor (1,35): S\u22611 mod35 \u21921 (too low).\n\nFor (5,7): S\u22610 mod5 and1 mod7. \n\nFind S=5m\u22611 mod7. \n\n5m \u22611 mod7 \u2192 m\u22613 mod7 (since 5*3=15\u22611 mod7). So m=3,10,17,24,31 \u2192 S=15,50,\u2026 but within 1-35:15,30. \n\nCheck S=15: 15 mod5=0, 15 mod7=1. Yes.\n\nS=30: 30 mod5=0, 30 mod7=2. Not. So only S=15.\n\nFor (7,5): S\u22610 mod7 and1 mod5. \n\nS=7n\u22611 mod5 \u21927n\u22611 mod5 \u21922n\u22611 mod5 \u2192n\u22613 mod5. \n\nThus n=3,8,13,18,23 \u2192 S=21,56,\u2026 Within 1-35:21, 56>35. So S=21. \n\nCheck 21 mod7=0, 21 mod5=1. Yes.\n\nFor (35,1): S\u22610 mod35 \u219235.\n\nThus solutions S=15,21,35. \n\nSo count is3. Still low.\n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 24 (k=23). \n\n23 is prime. \n\nThus coprime factorizations are (1,23),(23,1). \n\nThus two solutions.\n\nSolutions:\n\nS\u22611 mod23 \u21921 (too low).\n\nS=23. \n\nThus count=1.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, try b= 60 (k=59, prime). \n\nSame, only one solution.\n\nHmm, perhaps trying b= 210 (k=209). \n\n209 factors as 11*19. \n\nThus coprime factorizations: (1,209),(11,19),(19,11),(209,1). \n\nThus four solutions.\n\nSolutions:\n\nS\u22610 mod11 and1 mod19:\n\nLet me see for (11,19):\n\nS\u22610 mod11 and 1 mod19.\n\nLet S=11a \u22611 mod19 \u219211a \u22611 mod19 \u219211^{-1} mod19. \n\n11*7=77\u226177-4*19=77-76=1 mod19. So inverse is7. \n\nThus a\u22617 mod19. \n\nThus S=11*(7+19m)=77+209m. Within 1-209, S=77 and 77+209=286>209. So S=77.\n\nSimilarly for (19,11):\n\nS\u22610 mod19 and1 mod11.\n\nS=19b\u22611 mod11 \u219219\u22618 mod11 \u21928b\u22611 mod11 \u2192b\u22617 mod11 (8*7=56\u22611 mod11).\n\nThus b=7 \u2192 S=19*7=133.\n\nThus solutions:77 and133.\n\nPlus S=209.\n\nSo solutions in interval (ceil(sqrt(210))=15 to209):\n\nS=77,133,209. \n\nTotal of 3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps trying a b where b-1 is a factorial? Let's try b= 720+1=721. \n\nWait, b=721 (k=720). \n\n720 has prime factors 2^4*3^2*5. So distinct primes 2,3,5. So 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nBut the interval is sqrt(721)=26.8, so S from27 to720. \n\nThe number of solutions would be 8, but spread over a large interval. So likely less than 10. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I need to try b= 120 (k=119). 119=7*17.\n\nCoprime factorizations (1,119),(7,17),(17,7),(119,1). So four solutions.\n\nSolutions:\n\nFor (7,17): S\u22610 mod7 and1 mod17.\n\nS=7a \u22611 mod17 \u21927a\u22611 mod17 \u2192a\u22615 mod17 (7*5=35\u22611 mod17). \n\nThus a=5 \u2192 S=35.\n\na=5+17=22 \u2192 S=7*22=154.\n\nWithin 1-119:35 and154>119. So S=35.\n\nSimilarly (17,7): S\u22610 mod17 and1 mod7.\n\nS=17b\u22611 mod7 \u219217\u22613 mod7 \u21923b\u22611 mod7 \u2192b\u22615 mod7 \u2192b=5 \u2192S=85.\n\nb=12 \u2192S=17*12=204>119.\n\nThus S=85.\n\nThus solutions S=35,85,119.\n\nInterval is sqrt(120)=10.95 \u219211 to119. \n\nThus count=3 solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe trying b= 105 (k=104). \n\n104=8*13 \u2192 factors 2^3*13. \n\nPrime factors are 2 and13. Thus 2^2=4 solutions. \n\nThe coprime factorizations are (1,104),(8,13),(13,8),(104,1). \n\nSolutions:\n\nFor (8,13): S\u22610 mod8 and1 mod13. \n\nS=8a \u22611 mod13 \u21928a\u22611 mod13 \u2192a\u22615 mod13 (8*5=40\u22611 mod13). \n\nThus a=5 \u2192 S=40.\n\na=5+13=18 \u2192S=144>104. So S=40.\n\n(13,8): S\u22610 mod13 and1 mod8.\n\nS=13b\u22611 mod8 \u219213\u22615 mod8 \u21925b\u22611 mod8 \u2192b\u22615 mod8 (5*5=25\u22611 mod8). \n\nb=5 \u2192S=65.\n\nb=13 \u2192S=169>104. So S=65.\n\nThus solutions S=40,65,104.\n\nInterval is sqrt(105)=10.24 \u219211 to104. \n\nThus count=3 solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to consider b= 210 (k=209). Wait tried that.\n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 84 (k=83, prime). So only two solutions. \n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps b= 66 (k=65). 65=5*13. \n\nCoprime factorizations: (1,65),(5,13),(13,5),(65,1). \n\nThus four solutions.\n\nSolutions:\n\nFor (5,13): S\u22610 mod5 and1 mod13. \n\nS=5a\u22611 mod13 \u21925a\u22611 mod13 \u2192a\u22618 mod13 (5*8=40\u22611 mod13). \n\na=8 \u2192 S=40.\n\na=21 \u2192 S=105>65. So S=40.\n\n(13,5): S\u22610 mod13 and1 mod5.\n\nS=13b\u22611 mod5 \u219213\u22613 mod5 \u21923b\u22611 mod5 \u2192b\u22612 mod5. \n\nb=2 \u2192 S=26. \n\nb=7 \u2192 S=91>65. So S=26.\n\nThus solutions S=26,40,65. \n\nInterval is sqrt(66)=8.12 \u21929 to65. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is not working. Maybe my initial assumption that we need 5 primes is correct, but perhaps the minimal b is smaller?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the number of solutions is exactly 2^k. \n\nWait, for example, with n=6 (b=7), which has two primes, the number of coprime factorizations is four, but the number of solutions in the interval was 3. So perhaps it's 2^{k} minus the ones below the interval. \n\nTherefore, if we have 2^{k} solutions total, and the interval is roughly from sqrt(n) to n, which is a significant portion, maybe the number of solutions in the interval is roughly 2^{k} - sqrt(n). \n\nThus, to have more than 10 solutions, 2^{k} - sqrt(n) >10. \n\nSince n =b-1, which is roughly 2^{k} (if primes are small), but this is getting too vague. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to try b= 120 (k=119). Wait tried that.\n\nAlternatively, try b= 2520 (k=2519). \n\nWait that's too big. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of S such that S(S-1) is divisible by many numbers. \n\nFor instance, S= 10, as above, contributes to b=11,16,19,31,46,91. \n\nSimilarly, S= 11: S(S-1)=110. Divisors of 110 are 1,2,5,10,11,22,55,110. \n\nThus for b-1 in 11 to 110, divisors are 10,11,22,55,110. \n\nThus b=11,12,23,56,111. \n\nEach of these b's get a solution from S=11. \n\nContinuing this way, perhaps a b that is a common multiple of many such S(S-1) terms. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 60:\n\nWait k=59, prime. \n\nNo.\n\nAlternatively, b= 120. \n\nWait tried that. \n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121 (k=120). \n\nk=120 has prime factors 2^3*3*5 \u2192 three distinct primes.

Let me think differently.\n\nThe equation is d1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b -1), and d0 = S - d1. \n\nSince d0 must be between 0 and b-1, so S - d1 must be in that range. \n\nBut since d1 is between 1 and b-1, S must be between d1 and d1 + (b-1). \n\nBut perhaps there's a way to set up S and b such that multiple S work for the same b. \n\nSuppose we pick b-1 such that it divides multiple S(S-1). \n\nFor example, if b-1 is 24 (so b=25), then S(S-1) must be divisible by24. \n\nPossible S such that S(S-1) divisible by24:\n\nSince 24=3*8, so S or S-1 must be divisible by3, and one of S or S-1 divisible by8, or split between 2^3 and3. \n\nPossible S:\n\nLet me list S from 5 to24 (since ceil(sqrt(25))=5):\n\nCheck which S(S-1) divisible by24.\n\nCompute S(S-1) mod24:\n\nS=5:5*4=20 mod24=20\u2192 no\n\nS=6:6*5=30 mod24=6\u2192 no\n\nS=7:7*6=42 mod24=18\u2192 no\n\nS=8:8*7=56 mod24=8\u2192 no\n\nS=9:9*8=72 mod24=0\u2192 yes\n\nS=10:10*9=90 mod24=18\u2192 no\n\nS=11:11*10=110 mod24=110-4*24=110-96=14\u2192 no\n\nS=12:12*11=132 mod24=0\u2192 yes (132-5*24=132-120=12\u2192 no, wait 132/24=5.5, so remainder 12?

Maybe I need to consider that the problem might require a different approach. \n\nWait, let me think differently. The equation is S\u00b2 =d1*b +d0, and S=d1 +d0. \n\nSubstituting d0=S-d1 gives S\u00b2 =d1*b + (S-d1) \u2192 S\u00b2 -S =d1*(b-1). \n\nSo, d1=(S\u00b2 -S)/(b-1). \n\nSince d1 must be an integer between1 and b-1, then (S\u00b2 -S) must be divisible by (b-1), and the result must be between1 and b-1. \n\nThus, for each S, the possible b-1 must be a divisor of S(S-1), and (b-1) must be between (S\u00b2 -S)/(b-1) >=1 and <=b-1. \n\nWait, but this is circular. \n\nAlternatively, let's think of b-1 divides S(S-1), so b-1 \u2264 S(S-1). \n\nAnd also, since n=S\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, so b \u2264S\u00b2 <b\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, b must be between S and S\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, for each S, possible b's are divisors of S(S-1) between S and S\u00b2. \n\nThus, the total number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b is the number of S such that S(S-1) is divisible by (b-1) and b is between S and S\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, to find the first b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps I can iterate S and count the number of b's contributed by each S. \n\nFor example, S=10 contributes to b's where b-1 divides 90, and b is between10 and100. \n\nSimilarly, S=11 contributes to divisors of 110 between11 and 121. \n\nIf I can find a b that is in the range of multiple S's. \n\nLet me try to list the number of S's for a particular b by considering all S such that S(S-1) divisible by (b-1) and b is between S and S\u00b2. \n\nSuppose we pick b= 120 (k=119). \n\nThen we need S such that S(S-1) divisible by119, and S between ceil(sqrt(120))=11 and119. \n\nThe solutions are S=35,85,119. So three. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider b= 210 (k=209). \n\nS must be between15 and209. \n\nSolutions are S=77,133,209.

Two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 840 (k=839, prime). Two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, b= 90 (k=89, prime). Two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 105 (k=104). \n\nSolutions S=40,65,104. Three. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 180 (k=179, prime). Two. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 210 (k=209). \n\nWait done. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is really frustrating. Maybe the minimal b is 2311, but that seems too big. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in the problem understanding. \n\nThe problem says \"the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers\". \n\nPerhaps there is a b where multiple S's contribute. \n\nLet me try S= 12:\n\nS(S-1)=132. \n\nDivisors of 132 between12 and144 (since b must be between12 and144). \n\nDivisors of132:1,2,3,4,6,11,12,22,33,44,66,132. \n\nSo between12 and144:\n\n12,22,33,44,66,132. \n\nThus b-1=12,22,33,44,66,132 \u2192b=13,23,34,45,67,133. \n\nEach of these b's gets a solution from S=12. \n\nSimilarly, S=13:\n\nS(S-1)=156. \n\nDivisors between13 and169:\n\n13,26,39,52,78,156. \n\nThus b=14,27,40,53,79,157. \n\nS=14:\n\nS(S-1)=182. Divisors between14 and196:\n\n14,26,91,182. \n\nThus b=15,27,92,183. \n\nContinuing this way, for each S, there are several b's. \n\nThus, the total number of b-eautiful numbers for a particular b is the number of S's such that b-1 divides S(S-1) and b is between S and S\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, to have more than ten b-eautiful numbers for a given b, there must be more than ten S's such that b-1 divides S(S-1) and S is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. \n\nPerhaps the first b where this occurs is when b-1 is a highly composite number with many factors, allowing many S's. \n\nThe smallest highly composite number with many factors is 360 (360 has 24 divisors), but let me check b= 361 (k=360). \n\n360 factors are many: 2^3*3^2*5. \n\nPrime factors:2,3,5. \n\nThus coprime factorizations: 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nBut the interval is sqrt(361)=19 \u219219 to360. \n\nThe solutions would be S such that S(S-1) divisible by360. \n\nThis requires S or S-1 divisible by 8, 9, and 5 in some combination. \n\nThis could result in more solutions. \n\nLet me try to compute the number of solutions for b=361 (k=360):\n\nPrime factors of360 are 2^3,3^2,5. \n\nThe coprime factorizations require assigning primes to d1 or d2. \n\nEach prime group must be entirely in one factor. \n\nThus, the coprime factor pairs are determined by the assignment of the prime factors to d1 or d2. \n\nThe number of coprime factorizations is 2^3=8 (since three distinct primes:2,3,5). \n\nEach such factorization corresponds to a solution S. \n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. (1,360): S\u22611 mod360 \u21921 (too low).\n\n2. (2^3, 3^2*5)= (8,45): S\u22610 mod8 and1 mod45. \n\nFind S=8a\u22611 mod45 \u21928a\u22611 mod45 \u2192a\u226129 mod45 (8*29=232\u2261232-5*45=232-225=7 mod45 \u2192 no, wait. \n\nWait 8a\u22611 mod45. \n\nFind inverse of8 mod45. \n\n45=5*9. \n\nFind x such that8x\u22611 mod45. \n\nTrying 8* 29=232 mod45: 232-5*45=232-225=7 mod45. Not. \n\n8* 23=184 mod45: 184-4*45=184-180=4 mod45. \n\n8* 32=256 mod45:256-5*45=256-225=31 mod45. \n\nHmm, this is time-consuming. Maybe better to use the extended Euclidean algorithm. \n\nFind integers x,y such that8x +45y=1. \n\n45=5*8 +5 \n\n8=1*5 +3 \n\n5=1*3 +2 \n\n3=1*2 +1 \n\n2=2*1 +0 \n\nBackwards:\n\n1=3-1*2 \n\n=3 -1*(5 -1*3) =2*3 -5 \n\n=2*(8 -1*5) -5 =2*8 -3*5 \n\n=2*8 -3*(45 -5*8) =2*8 -3*45 +15*8 \n\n=17*8 -3*45 \n\nThus x=17 mod45. \n\nThus a\u226117 mod45. \n\nThus S=8*17=136. \n\n3.

Perhaps the minimal b is 211 (k=210), but even that gives 8 solutions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 255 (k=254=2\u00d7127). \n\n254 is 2\u00d7127.

Two solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nI think I have to concede that perhaps the minimal b is 2311, but since that is too big, there must be a smaller b. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem wants us to consider when the number of solutions exceeds 10, so perhaps when the number of coprime factorizations exceeds 10. \n\nWait, for k= 240 (2^4*3*5). \n\nPrime factors 2,3,5 \u2192 three primes. \n\nThus 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me consider k= 120 (2^3*3*5). \n\nThree primes. \n\nThus 8 solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of b= 840 (k=839, prime). Two solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach. Let me think of the equation again: \n\nWe need S(S-1) divisible by (b-1), and S between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1. \n\nIf we pick b-1= 24 (so b=25), then S can be 9,16,24. \n\nBut if I pick b-1= 60 (b=61), then S can be  10, 15, 20, 30, etc.? \n\nWait let me compute for b=61 (k=60):\n\nPrime factors of60: 2^2*3*5 \u2192 three primes. \n\nThus 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nInterval sqrt(61)=7.8 \u21928 to60. \n\nSolutions S=?\n\nCoprime factorizations:\n\n(1,60),(3,20),(4,15),(5,12),(12,5),(15,4),(20,3),(60,1). \n\nWait coprime pairs must have gcd(d1,d2)=1. \n\nThus valid coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,60),(3,20),(4,15),(5,12). \n\nTheir reverses are also valid. \n\nThus total 8 solutions. \n\nLet me compute them:\n\n(3,20): S\u22610 mod3 and1 mod20. \n\nS=3a\u22611 mod20 \u21923a\u22611 mod20 \u2192a\u22617 mod20 (3*7=21\u22611 mod20). \n\nThus a=7 \u2192S=21. \n\n(20,3): S\u22610 mod20 and1 mod3. \n\nS=20b\u22611 mod3 \u219220\u22612 mod3 \u21922b\u22611 mod3 \u2192b\u22612 mod3. \n\nb=2 \u2192S=40. \n\n(4,15): S\u22610 mod4 and1 mod15. \n\nS=4c\u22611 mod15 \u21924c\u22611 mod15 \u2192c\u22614 mod15 (4*4=16\u22611 mod15). \n\nThus c=4 \u2192S=16. \n\n(15,4): S\u22610 mod15 and1 mod4. \n\nS=15d\u22611 mod4 \u219215\u22613 mod4 \u21923d\u22611 mod4 \u2192d\u22613 mod4. \n\nd=3 \u2192S=45. \n\n(5,12): S\u22610 mod5 and1 mod12. \n\nS=5e\u22611 mod12 \u21925e\u22611 mod12 \u2192e\u22615 mod12 (5*5=25\u22611 mod12). \n\nThus e=5 \u2192S=25. \n\n(12,5): S\u22610 mod12 and1 mod5. \n\nS=12f\u22611 mod5 \u219212\u22612 mod5 \u21922f\u22611 mod5 \u2192f\u22613 mod5. \n\nf=3 \u2192S=36. \n\n(60,1): S=60. \n\n(1,60): S=1 (too low). \n\nThus the solutions are S=16,21,25,36,40,45,60. \n\nInterval is 8 to60. \n\nThus count=7. \n\nHmm, still under 10. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to try b= 252 (k=251, prime). \n\nNo, only two solutions. \n\nAlternatively, b= 360 (k=359, prime). Two solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b= 840 (k=839, prime).

Then:\n\nx \u2264S\u00b2 -S \u2264x\u00b2. \n\nThus, for each S, x can be any integer between S\u00b2 -S and x\u00b2 \u2265S\u00b2 -S \u2192 x \u2265sqrt(S\u00b2 -S). \n\nTherefore, for each S, the possible x are from max(ceil(sqrt(S\u00b2 -S)), S) up to S\u00b2 -S. \n\nBut since x must also be less than S\u00b2 (since b=x+1 must be less than S\u00b2). \n\nThus, the number of x's (i.e., b's) for each S is the number of integers between max(ceil(sqrt(S\u00b2 -S)), S) and S\u00b2 -S. \n\nTherefore, the total number of b's for a given S is (S\u00b2 -S) - max(ceil(sqrt(S\u00b2 -S)), S) +1. \n\nTo find the minimal b where the total exceeds 10, perhaps we need to find S such that the number of b's is large. \n\nFor example, take S= 10:\n\nThe number of x's (b-1) is between max(ceil(sqrt(100-10)),10)=max(9,10)=10 and 90. \n\nThus, 90-10+1=81 numbers. \n\nThus S=10 contributes 81 b's. \n\nBut each b can have multiple S's. \n\nWait, but we need to find a b where the number of S's is more than10. \n\nThus, for a particular b, the number of S's is the number of S such that S(S-1) divisible by (b-1), and S between sqrt(b) and b-1. \n\nThus, to have more than ten S's for a given b, we need many S's such that (b-1) divides S(S-1). \n\nThus, if b-1 is a highly composite number with many factors, then there are many S's. \n\nThe first number with more than ten divisors is 24 (24 has 8 divisors), 36 (9), 48 (10), 60 (12). \n\nWait, 60 has 12 divisors. \n\nThus, let's try b=61 (k=60). \n\nAs before, for b=61 (k=60), we had seven solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nNext, 120 has 16 divisors. \n\nThus b=121 (k=120) gives seven solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nNext, 180 has 18 divisors. \n\nLet me try b=181 (k=180). \n\nPrime factors of 180: 2\u00b2*3\u00b2*5. \n\nDistinct primes:2,3,5. Thus 2^3=8 solutions. \n\nThus the count would be around 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nNext, 240 has 20 divisors. \n\nb=241 (k=240). \n\nPrime factors of240:2^4*3*5. \n\nDistinct primes:2,3,5 \u2192 three. Thus 8 solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nNext, 360 has 24 divisors. \n\nb=361 (k=360). \n\nAs before, seven solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nNext, 720 has 30 divisors. \n\nb=721 (k=720). \n\nPrime factors:2^4*3^2*5*7. \n\nDistinct primes:2,3,5,7 \u2192 four. Thus 16 solutions. \n\nThus the count could be around 16 solutions. \n\nThus, for b=721, the interval is sqrt(721)=26.85 \u219227 to720. \n\nThe number of solutions would be 16 minus those below 27. \n\nAssuming half are in the upper half, maybe 8. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, this is not working. Maybe the minimal b is 2311. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem has a different approach. Let me think of the equation again:\n\nd1 = (S\u00b2 - S)/(b-1). \n\nSince d1 must be an integer between1 and b-1, then:\n\n(S\u00b2 - S) must be divisible by (b-1). \n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nb = (S\u00b2 - S)/d1 +1. \n\nThus, for each S and d1 such that d1 divides S(S-1), and 1 \u2264d1 \u2264b-1. \n\nBut b is dependent on d1. \n\nAlternatively, for a given S, possible d1 can be any divisor of S(S-1), and then b is determined. \n\nThus, the total number of b's is the number of divisors of S(S-1) for S in a range. \n\nBut I need to find a b where multiple S's contribute. \n\nAlternatively, if I set d1=1, then b=S(S-1)+1. \n\nThus, for any S, there is a b where d1=1. \n\nThus, for S from2 upwards, b=S(S-1)+1. \n\nThus, each S gives a unique b where d1=1. \n\nThus, for example, S=11 gives b=110+1=111. \n\nThus, for b=111, there is at least one solution (S=11). \n\nSimilarly, S=10 gives b=91. \n\nThus, for each b of the form S(S-1)+1, there is at least one solution. \n\nThus, the count for these b's is at least one. \n\nTo have more than ten solutions, need at least ten different S's such that S(S-1)+1=b, and other conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is when S ranges up to a point where there are multiple S's leading to the same b. \n\nAlternatively, consider that for b-1= S(S-1), then d1=1, so n=S\u00b2. \n\nThus, for each S, there is a b=S(S-1)+1. \n\nThus, for example, S=11 gives b=111. \n\nThus, the count for b=111 would have at least one solution. \n\nBut to have more than ten, need ten different S's such that b-1 divides S(S-1). \n\nPerhaps if b-1 is a common multiple of many S(S-1) terms. \n\nThe smallest number that is a multiple of S(S-1) for ten different S's. \n\nThis would require b-1 to be the least common multiple of ten different S(S-1) terms. \n\nThe minimal LCM of S(S-1) for S=2 to11 is LCM(2,6,12,20,30,42,56,72,90,110). \n\nCalculating LCM of these:\n\nFactors:\n\n2=2\n\n6=2\u00d73\n\n12=2\u00b2\u00d73\n\n20=2\u00b2\u00d75\n\n30=2\u00d73\u00d75\n\n42=2\u00d73\u00d77\n\n56=2\u00b3\u00d77\n\n72=2\u00b3\u00d73\u00b2\n\n90=2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75\n\n110=2\u00d75\u00d711\n\nThus LCM is 2\u00b3\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75\u00d77\u00d711=8\u00d79\u00d75\u00d77\u00d711= 8\u00d79=72, 72\u00d75=360, 360\u00d77=2520, 2520\u00d711=27720. \n\nThus, b=27721. \n\nThis is way too large, so likely not the answer. \n\nHmm. \n\nPerhaps I should consider that the minimal b is 211 (k=210). \n\n210 has prime factors2,3,5,7. \n\nThus, 2^4=16 solutions. \n\nThe interval sqrt(211)=14.5 \u219215 to210. \n\nThus, the solutions would be S= ?\n\nLet me compute them. \n\nPrime factors of210=2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77. \n\nCoprime factorizations: \n\nEach prime can be assigned to d1 or d2. \n\nThus, there are 16 coprime factorizations. \n\nLet me list them:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d1,d2) where d1*d2=210 and gcd(d1,d2)=1:\n\n(1,210),(2,105),(3,70),(5,42),(6,35),(7,30),(10,21),(14,15),\n\nand their reverses. \n\nTotal 8 pairs, but since ordered pairs, it's 16. \n\nWait no, the coprime factorizations are unordered pairs with order considered. \n\nActually, the coprime ordered pairs are 2^4=16. \n\nLet me proceed:\n\nFor each subset of primes assigned to d1:\n\n1. d1=1: d2=210. \n\nS\u22610 mod1 and1 mod210 \u2192S=1 mod210 \u2192S=1 (too low). \n\n2. d1=2: d2=105. \n\nS\u22610 mod2 and1 mod105. \n\nS=2a\u22611 mod105 \u21922a\u22611 mod105 \u2192a\u226153 mod105 (2\u00d753=106\u22611 mod105). \n\nThus a=53 \u2192S=106. \n\n3. d1=3: d2=70. \n\nS\u22610 mod3 and1 mod70. \n\nS=3a\u22611 mod70 \u21923a\u22611 mod70 \u2192a\u226147 mod70 (3\u00d747=141\u22611 mod70). \n\na=47 \u2192S=141. \n\n4. d1=5: d2=42. \n\nS\u22610 mod5 and1 mod42. \n\nS=5a\u22611 mod42 \u21925a\u22611 mod42 \u2192a\u226113 mod42 (5\u00d713=65\u226165-42=23 mod42.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is first. \n\nThe problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when you write n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense. \n\nSo, my task is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's formalize the conditions. If n is a two-digit number in base b, then n can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are the digits. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a must be at least 1 and at most b-1 (since base b digits go from 0 to b-1, but the first digit can't be 0). The second digit c can be from 0 to b-1. \n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals the square root of n. So, a + c = \u221an. But since n = a*b + c, substituting that in gives a + c = \u221a(a*b + c). \n\nSo, our equation to solve is:\n\na + c = \u221a(a*b + c)\n\nWe need to find all pairs (a, c) where a is from 1 to b-1, c from 0 to b-1, such that the above equation holds. Each such pair corresponds to a unique n, which is a*b + c. \n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such (a, c) pairs exceeds ten.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe rearrange the equation to make it easier to handle?\n\nStarting with:\n\na + c = \u221a(a*b + c)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root. That would give:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe rearrange terms:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe group terms differently. Let's see:\n\na\u00b2 - a*b + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms with a:\n\na(a - b + 2c) + c(c - 1) = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Let's try to write the equation as:\n\na*b = (a + c)^2 - c\n\nWait, starting again:\n\nOriginal equation after squaring: (a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nTherefore, a*b = (a + c)^2 - c = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c\n\nThus, a*b = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\na*b - a\u00b2 - 2ac - c\u00b2 + c = 0\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of variables. Let me think of variables a and c with constraints 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express c in terms of a or vice versa.\n\nLet me try to express c in terms of a. Let me denote s = a + c, so s = \u221an. Since n = a*b + c, s\u00b2 = a*b + c. \n\nBut since s = a + c, then substituting c = s - a into the second equation gives:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + (s - a)\n\nSo:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + s - a\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\ns\u00b2 - s - a*b + a = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms with a:\n\ns\u00b2 - s - a(b - 1) = 0\n\nThen, solving for a:\n\na(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s\n\nThus,\n\na = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, interesting. So for a to be an integer between 1 and b-1, the right-hand side must be an integer and satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1.\n\nAlso, since c = s - a must also be between 0 and b -1, so c = s - a must be \u22650 and \u2264 b -1.\n\nTherefore, let me note down the constraints:\n\n1. a must be an integer in [1, b-1]\n\n2. c = s - a must be an integer in [0, b-1]\n\n3. s = a + c must satisfy s\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nBut from the above, we can express a in terms of s and b:\n\na = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nTherefore, for a to be integer, (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, since a must be positive, s\u00b2 - s must be positive, so s(s -1 ) >0, so s \u22652 (since s is a positive integer, as it's the sum of digits a and c which are non-negative, but since a \u22651, s must be at least 1, but actually, since c can be 0, s could be a +0 = a \u22651. However, s is sqrt(n), which must be an integer, so n must be a perfect square. So s is an integer, and n = s\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, s must be an integer, and n = s\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and b\u00b2 -1 (the largest two-digit number, which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1). \n\nTherefore, s\u00b2 must satisfy b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1. Since s is the square root of n, s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is less than b, so s can go up to b-1. So s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1. Wait, but s is the square root of n which is two-digit in base b. The minimal n is b, so s must be at least sqrt(b). Since s must be integer, the minimal s is ceiling(sqrt(b)), and the maximum s is floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)) which is b-1. \n\nTherefore, s can range from ceiling(sqrt(b)) to b -1. \n\nSo, for each s in that interval, we can check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). If yes, then a is (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), and then c = s - a. Then, check if c is between 0 and b -1, and also check that a is between 1 and b-1. \n\nAlternatively, since a and c are determined once s and b are given, perhaps we can structure this as follows:\n\nFor a given base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that:\n\n1. (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), i.e., (s\u00b2 - s) mod (b -1) =0,\n\n2. a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1,\n\n3. c = s - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b -1.\n\nTherefore, for each s in that range, we can check these conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can reorganize the equation to express b in terms of s and a. Let me see:\n\nFrom a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), we can write:\n\nb -1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/a\n\nThus,\n\nb = (s\u00b2 - s)/a +1\n\nSo, since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, for each s and a, this gives a possible b. However, since we are looking for a particular b and the number of s's (or a's) that satisfy this, perhaps this is more useful when considering for a given s and a, what b would allow that, but maybe not directly helpful for counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the problem as for each b, iterate over possible s from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, and for each s, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), then compute a and c, check their validity. \n\nBut since we need to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps we can find a way to compute the number of solutions for a given b and then find when it exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find a formula for the number of solutions in terms of b. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote that for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1) must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a must be between 0 and b -1.\n\nAlternatively, since a must be between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1, then combining these:\n\nc = s - a \u22650 => a \u2264 s,\n\nand c = s -a \u2264 b-1 => a \u2265 s - (b-1).\n\nBut since a is at least 1, so s - (b-1) \u2264 a \u2264 s,\n\nand also a must be between 1 and b -1.\n\nTherefore, the constraints on a are:\n\nmax(1, s - (b -1)) \u2264 a \u2264 min(b -1, s)\n\nBut since a must also equal (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), which is a specific value. So for each s, either (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1) or not, and if it is, then a is fixed as (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). So we need to check if that a is within the required range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to rephrase, for a given s and b, a is uniquely determined as (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1). Therefore, for each s in the range, if this a is an integer between 1 and b-1, and c = s -a is between 0 and b-1, then it counts as a solution.\n\nBut given that c = s - a, and a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), substituting gives c = s - (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Let me see:\n\nc = s - (s(s -1))/(b -1) \n\nHmm, so c has to be an integer between 0 and b-1. Since a is already an integer (because (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by b-1 for a to be integer), then c will also be an integer because s and a are integers.\n\nTherefore, the key conditions are:\n\n1. (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1).\n\n2. The resulting a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1.\n\n3. c = s - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b -1.\n\nBut since a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), the first condition is the critical one. Let me see if I can find a way to count the number of s for a given b that satisfy this.\n\nAlternatively, since s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, perhaps for each b, the number of s's such that (s\u00b2 - s) mod (b-1) = 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a quadratic in s. Let me see:\n\nWe can write s\u00b2 - s \u2261 0 mod (b -1). So s(s - 1) \u2261 0 mod (b -1). \n\nTherefore, for each s, s(s -1) must be divisible by (b -1). So (b -1) divides s(s -1).\n\nTherefore, for each s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, check if (b-1) divides s(s -1). \n\nHmm, so this is equivalent to s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b-1). Therefore, the number of s in that interval where s and s-1 are such that their product is divisible by (b-1).\n\nAlternatively, since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So their GCD is 1. Therefore, for their product to be divisible by (b-1), the factors of (b-1) must be distributed between s and s-1. Since they are coprime, one of them must be divisible by each prime power in (b-1)'s factorization. \n\nAlternatively, this might not be straightforward. Maybe instead of trying to find a formula, it's better to think of possible values of b and compute the number of solutions for each, until we find the first one with more than ten.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the minimal b where this happens, maybe we can find a pattern or a way to calculate how the number of solutions grows with b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that for each s between 1 and b-1, but actually s starts at ceil(sqrt(b)), so the lower limit is higher. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that s(s -1) is divisible by (b -1). \n\nLet me think of an example. Let's take b=13 as in the problem's example. Then b-1=12. The s must be between ceil(sqrt(13)) = 4 and 12. So s from 4 to 12. Now, for each s in 4 to 12, check if s(s-1) is divisible by 12.\n\nLet me see:\n\ns=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 12. So yes. Then a=(16 -4)/12=12/12=1. Then c=4-1=3. So n=1*13 +3=16? Wait, but the example said 81 is 13-eautiful. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the example, 81 is 63 in base 13. 6*13 +3=81. So s should be sqrt(81)=9. So s=9. Let me check s=9 for b=13. \n\ns=9: 9*8=72. 72 divided by 12 (b-1=12) is 6. So a= (81 -9)/12 =72/12=6. Then c=9 -6=3. That's correct. So yes, s=9 is a solution. \n\nSo for b=13, how many solutions are there? Let's check all s from 4 to 12:\n\ns=4: 4*3=12 divisible by 12. So a= (16-4)/12=1. Then c=3. So n=1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4, which is s=4. So that's valid. \n\ns=5: 5*4=20. 20 mod 12 is 8, so not divisible by 12. So no.\n\ns=6: 6*5=30 mod12 is 6. Not divisible.\n\ns=7: 7*6=42 mod12 is 6. Not divisible.\n\ns=8:8*7=56 mod12= 56-48=8. Not divisible.\n\ns=9: 9*8=72 divisible by 12. So yes, as above.\n\ns=10:10*9=90 mod12: 90-72=18 mod12=6. Not divisible.\n\ns=11:11*10=110 mod12: 110-96=14 mod12=2. Not divisible.\n\ns=12:12*11=132 mod12=0. So yes. \n\nWait, s=12. Let's check:\n\na=(144 -12)/12=132/12=11. Since b=13, a=11 is allowed (since a must be \u226412). Then c=12 -11=1. Then n=11*13 +1=143. sqrt(143) is about 11.96, not an integer. Wait, but s is supposed to be sqrt(n). Wait, s=12, so sqrt(n)=12, so n=144. Wait, but 11*13 +1=143, which is not 144. Wait, this is a problem. Did I do something wrong?\n\nHold on, maybe my mistake here. Let's check the calculation again.\n\nIf s=12, then n = s\u00b2 = 144. To write 144 in base 13: 13^2 is 169, which is more than 144. So the two-digit number would be (a,b) where a*13 + c =144. So a is the first digit: 144 divided by 13 is 11 with remainder 1 (since 11*13=143, 144-143=1). So indeed, the digits are 11 and 1. Their sum is 12, which is sqrt(144)=12. So that works. But in my previous calculation, I thought of c as s -a, which would be 12-11=1, so that's correct. So n is indeed 11*13 +1=144. Wait, 11*13 is 143 +1 is 144. Right, so that works. So s=12 is valid. \n\nSo for b=13, s=4,9,12. So three solutions? Wait, but in the example, 81 is one of them, but there are two others: 16 and 144. Wait, so actually, three numbers. But the problem says 81 is 13-eautiful, so that's one of them. So for b=13, there are three b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, so the count is three. \n\nWait, but maybe I missed some s?\n\nLet me check s=3. Wait, s must be at least ceil(sqrt(13)) which is 4, so s=3 is too low. So s starts at 4. So 4,9,12. So three numbers. \n\nTherefore, for b=13, there are three solutions. \n\nSo the problem wants the first b where the number of solutions exceeds 10. Let's see. \n\nTherefore, perhaps trying to find for different values of b, compute the number of solutions. Since the problem is asking for the minimal b where this count is more than ten, perhaps we can find an approach that allows us to compute this without brute-forcing all bases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the equation s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, as consecutive integers, then (b-1) must divide the product s(s-1). Since they are coprime, (b-1) must divide either s or s-1, but not necessarily exactly one. Wait, actually, since they are coprime, the factors of (b-1) must be partitioned between s and s-1. \n\nTherefore, (b-1) can be written as d1*d2 where d1 divides s and d2 divides (s-1), with gcd(d1,d2)=1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of (b-1) as a factor that must divide either s or s-1, but not necessarily entirely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of possible divisors of (b-1). For each divisor d of (b-1), then s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod (b-1/d). Wait, maybe this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, note that for each s, the condition is that (b-1) divides s(s-1). Therefore, for each s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], if s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1), then that s gives a solution. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in that interval where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that for s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], the values of s(s-1) can be considered modulo (b-1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of (b-1) as N, so N = b-1. Then, the problem becomes for N \u22651 (since b\u22652), find the minimal N+1 (so b) such that the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(N+1)), N] where s(s-1) \u22610 mod N exceeds 10. \n\nSo perhaps let me rephrase variables: Let N = b -1, so b = N+1. Then, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(N+1)), N] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod N must be greater than 10. We need to find the smallest N where this holds, then add 1 to get b. \n\nHmm, maybe that's a better way. Let me see.\n\nSo now, the problem is in terms of N. Let me see if this helps.\n\nWe need to find the minimal N \u22651 such that the number of integers s with ceil(sqrt(N+1)) \u2264 s \u2264 N and s(s-1) \u22610 mod N exceeds 10. Then b=N+1 is the answer.\n\nNow, perhaps this is a better way to approach. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nNote that s(s -1) \u22610 mod N implies that N divides s(s-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, the prime factors of N must be distributed between s and s-1. So, for each prime power dividing N, it divides either s or s-1 but not both. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(N+1)), N] such that s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod d, where d is a factor? Hmm, not exactly, but perhaps the number of s in that interval where s \u22610 mod some divisor of N, or s\u22611 mod some divisor?\n\nAlternatively, since s and s-1 are coprime, the condition N divides s(s-1) is equivalent to N divides s(s-1), and since gcd(s,s-1)=1, this implies that N must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1. \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of N, such that d divides s and N/d divides (s-1), then s must satisfy s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (N/d). \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of N, there is a solution s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (N/d). The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that if d and N/d are coprime, then there is a unique solution mod N. \n\nHowever, since d and N/d may not be coprime, the congruence may not have a solution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's complicated. Maybe instead of going this route, think of the number of solutions s in [1, N] where s(s-1) \u22610 mod N, and then subtract those s less than ceil(sqrt(N+1)). \n\nWait, maybe first count the number of s in [1, N] where s(s-1) \u22610 mod N, then subtract those s less than ceil(sqrt(N+1)), and then require that the remaining count is >10. \n\nBut how to count the number of s in [1,N] with s(s-1) \u22610 mod N?\n\nAlternatively, note that s(s-1) \u22610 mod N iff either s \u22610 mod N or s \u22611 mod N, or some combination where the factors of N divide s or s-1. Wait, no, that's not exactly. For example, if N=6, then s(s-1) must be divisible by 6. So s must be divisible by 2 or 3, and s-1 must be divisible by the remaining factors? Not exactly. Let me see with N=6:\n\nPossible s from 1 to 6:\n\ns=1: 1*0=0 mod6. So yes.\n\ns=2: 2*1=2 mod6\u22600.\n\ns=3:3*2=6\u22610 mod6. Yes.\n\ns=4:4*3=12\u22610 mod6. Yes.\n\ns=5:5*4=20\u22612 mod6\u22600.\n\ns=6:6*5=30\u22610 mod6. Yes.\n\nSo s=1,3,4,6. So 4 solutions. \n\nBut N=6, so the solutions are s=1,3,4,6. \n\nSo the count is 4. \n\nThus, for N=6, the number of solutions in [1,N] is 4. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the total number of solutions in [1,N] is equal to the number of divisors or something else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of N? Not exactly. For N=6, divisors are 1,2,3,6. But the solutions were 4, which is equal to the number of divisors. Hmm, interesting. \n\nWait, let's check with another N. Let's take N=4.\n\nN=4:\n\ns from 1 to4:\n\ns=1:0 mod4? 1*0=0 mod4? Yes, 0 mod4.\n\ns=2:2*1=2 mod4\u22600.\n\ns=3:3*2=6\u22612 mod4\u22600.\n\ns=4:4*3=12\u22610 mod4.\n\nThus solutions are s=1 and 4. So 2 solutions. Divisors of 4 are 1,2,4. So three divisors, but solutions are 2. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe not exactly. Let's see N=3:\n\nN=3:\n\ns=1:0 mod3? yes (0).\n\ns=2:2*1=2 mod3\u22600.\n\ns=3:3*2=6\u22610 mod3. So solutions are s=1,3. Two solutions. Divisors of 3 are 1,3. So again two, so matches here.\n\nHmm. N=5:\n\nN=5:\n\ns from1-5:\n\ns=1:0 mod5.\n\ns=2:2 mod5\u22600.\n\ns=3:6 mod5=1\u22600.\n\ns=4:12 mod5=2\u22600.\n\ns=5:20 mod5=0.\n\nThus solutions s=1,5. So two solutions. Divisors are 1,5. So matches again. \n\nHmm, N=8:\n\nN=8:\n\ns from1-8:\n\ns=1:0 mod8.\n\ns=2:2 mod8\u22600.\n\ns=3:6 mod8\u22600.\n\ns=4:12 mod8=4\u22600.\n\ns=5:20 mod8=4\u22600.\n\ns=6:30 mod8=6\u22600.\n\ns=7:42 mod8=2\u22600.\n\ns=8:56 mod8=0.\n\nThus solutions s=1 and 8. Two solutions. Divisors of 8:1,2,4,8. So four divisors, but only two solutions. Hmm, so that breaks the pattern. \n\nHmm. So maybe for prime N, it works, but not for composite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of N that are less than or equal to sqrt(N)? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s in [1,N] where s(s-1)\u22610 mod N is equal to the number of divisors of N plus 1? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me see another example. Take N=12 (so b=13, as in the problem). Then the number of solutions in [1,12]:\n\ns from1-12:\n\ns=1:0 mod12 yes.\n\ns=2:2 mod12 no.\n\ns=3:6 mod12 no.\n\ns=4:12 mod12=0 yes.\n\ns=5:20 mod12=8 no.\n\ns=6:30 mod12=6 no.\n\ns=7:42 mod12=6 no.\n\ns=8:56 mod12=8 no.\n\ns=9:72 mod12=0 yes.\n\ns=10:90 mod12=6 no.\n\ns=11:110 mod12=10 no.\n\ns=12:132 mod12=0 yes.\n\nThus solutions are s=1,4,9,12. Four solutions. So for N=12, four solutions. Divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. So six divisors, but only four solutions. Hmm. \n\nWait, so maybe the count is equal to the number of integers s in [1,N] where s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod (N/d) for some divisor d of N? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of solutions s is equal to the number of pairs (d, m) where d divides N and m is the solution mod N? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted. Maybe instead, for each N, the number of solutions in [1,N] is equal to the number of s where s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod (N/d) for some d dividing N. But this might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s in [1,N] is equal to the number of divisors of N plus 1? Not exactly. For N=6, it was 4, divisors are 4, so that matches. For N=12, divisors are 6, solutions are 4. Hmm, no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way. Let me think again. \n\nThe equation is s(s-1) \u22610 mod N. Since s and s-1 are coprime, this means that N must be a factor of s*(s-1). Since gcd(s,s-1)=1, then N must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1. \n\nTherefore, each divisor d of N gives rise to a solution where d divides s and N/d divides s-1, provided that d and N/d are coprime. \n\nWait, since d divides N, then N = d * k, so k = N/d. Then, if d and k are coprime, then by Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a unique solution modulo N to the system:\n\ns \u22610 mod d,\n\ns \u22611 mod k.\n\nTherefore, for each pair (d, k) where d*k = N and gcd(d,k)=1, there is a unique solution mod N. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions mod N is equal to the number of such pairs (d, k) with d*k=N and gcd(d,k)=1. Since each such pair corresponds to a unique solution. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s in [1,N] is equal to the number of such coprime pairs (d, k) with d*k=N, plus possibly 1? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, actually, each coprime pair (d, k) with d*k=N gives exactly one solution modulo N. So the total number of solutions in [1,N] is exactly equal to the number of such coprime pairs (d,k). \n\nBut since d and k are divisors of N with d*k=N and gcd(d,k)=1, the number of such pairs is equal to 2^{\u03c9(N)}, where \u03c9(N) is the number of distinct prime factors of N. Because for each prime factor, you have to choose whether it goes to d or to k. Since they have to be coprime, each prime can only go to one of them. \n\nWait, that seems correct. For example, if N is a prime power, say p^e, then the only coprime pairs (d,k) with d*k=N are (1,N) and (N,1). However, gcd(1,N)=1 and gcd(N,1)=1. But since d and k must multiply to N, so for N=p^e, the coprime pairs are (1, p^e) and (p^e,1). Thus two pairs, so number of solutions is 2. Which matches with previous examples. For example, N=3 (prime), solutions s=1 and 3. \n\nSimilarly, N=4 (which is 2^2), coprime pairs (1,4) and (4,1). So two solutions, which matches. \n\nFor N=6 (which is 2*3), the coprime pairs would be (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). Wait, but gcd(2,3)=1, so (2,3) is a valid pair, as well as (3,2). So total of 4 pairs. Therefore, the number of solutions should be 4, which matches the example with N=6 (solutions 1,3,4,6). \n\nSimilarly, for N=12 (which factors into 2^2*3), the number of coprime pairs (d,k) with d*k=12 would be 2^{number of prime factors}. Since prime factors are 2 and 3, so 2 primes, so 2^2=4. Let's see:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k):\n\n(1,12), (12,1),\n\n(3,4), (4,3),\n\nWait, 3 and 4 are coprime, and 3*4=12. Similarly, 2 and 6 are not coprime. 2*6=12 but gcd(2,6)=2\u22601. Similarly, 6 and 2 same. \n\nWait, so actually:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k) where d*k=12:\n\n- (1,12)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (12,1)\n\nSo total of four pairs. Therefore, four solutions, which matches the N=12 case (s=1,4,9,12). \n\nTherefore, the formula is that the number of solutions s in [1,N] is equal to 2^{\u03c9(N)}, where \u03c9(N) is the number of distinct prime factors of N. Wait, but for N=12, which has two distinct primes (2 and 3), we have 2^2=4 solutions, which matches. For N=6 (two primes), 4 solutions. For N=3 (one prime), 2 solutions. For N=8 (one prime, 2^3), two solutions. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions in [1,N] is indeed 2^{\u03c9(N)}. \n\nWait, but N=1? Let me check N=1. Then \u03c9(1)=0, so 2^0=1. Solutions s=1. Indeed, s(s-1)=0 mod1, which is always true, so s can be 1. \n\nTherefore, the formula seems to hold. So the number of solutions s in [1,N] is 2^{\u03c9(N)}. \n\nTherefore, this is a key insight. \n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions in [1,N] is 2^{\u03c9(N)}. \n\nTherefore, to compute the number of solutions in [ceil(sqrt(N+1)), N], we can take 2^{\u03c9(N)} minus the number of solutions s in [1, ceil(sqrt(N+1)) -1]. \n\nSo the total desired count is:\n\nNumber of solutions = 2^{\u03c9(N)} - (number of solutions s in [1, ceil(sqrt(N+1)) -1])\n\nBut we need this number to be greater than 10. \n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal N where:\n\n2^{\u03c9(N)} - (number of solutions s in [1, L-1]) >10, where L = ceil(sqrt(N+1))\n\nBut this still requires knowing the number of solutions below L, which complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for large enough N, the number of solutions in the lower interval is small compared to 2^{\u03c9(N)}. So maybe if 2^{\u03c9(N)} exceeds 10, then it might work? But let's see.\n\nWait, for example, if \u03c9(N) is 4, then 2^4=16. So 16 solutions total. But we need more than 10 above ceil(sqrt(N+1)). So if the lower part has less than 6, then it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions below ceil(sqrt(N+1)) is negligible for large N. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal N where 2^{\u03c9(N)} exceeds 10? Let's see:\n\n2^{\u03c9(N)} >10 \u21d2 \u03c9(N) \u22654, since 2^3=8 <10, 2^4=16>10. \n\nSo if N has at least four distinct prime factors, then the total number of solutions is at least 16. But then we have to subtract the solutions below ceil(sqrt(N+1)), but maybe that's small. \n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the count above the sqrt(N+1) is more than 10. So even if total is 16, but subtract maybe 5, then 11 is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal N with \u03c9(N)\u22654? Let's see the minimal N with four distinct prime factors is 2*3*5*7=210. But that might be too large. \n\nAlternatively, maybe N can have multiple exponents but still have \u03c9(N)=4. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a better approach. Since we need the number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(N+1)), N] to exceed 10, and the total solutions are 2^{\u03c9(N)}, then perhaps for N where 2^{\u03c9(N)} - (number of solutions below sqrt(N+1)) >10, so maybe even if \u03c9(N) is 4, but N is not too large so that the lower solutions are few. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can approximate:\n\nAssuming that the number of solutions below sqrt(N) is roughly proportional to sqrt(N)/N * total solutions? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of trying to compute this abstractly, let's try plugging in values of N and compute the required counts until we find the minimal N where the count exceeds 10. \n\nSince the problem is looking for the minimal b, which is N+1, we need to find the minimal N where the count is over 10, then add 1. \n\nLet me start testing N values incrementally. Let's start from small N and go up until the count exceeds 10.\n\nFirst, let me note that the formula for the number of solutions in [1,N] is 2^{\u03c9(N)}, so the total solutions are 2^{number of distinct prime factors of N}. \n\nTherefore, to get a large number of solutions, N must have many distinct prime factors. \n\nLet me start with N=30 (which has \u03c9(N)=3 (2,3,5)), so total solutions 8. \n\nBut need to compute the actual count above ceil(sqrt(N+1)). Let me compute for N=30.\n\nFirst, N=30, so b=31. \n\nceil(sqrt(N+1)) = ceil(sqrt(31))\u22485.564, so ceil is 6. \n\nSo we need to count solutions s from 6 to 30. \n\nTotal solutions in [1,30] are 2^{3}=8. \n\nNow, solutions in [1,5]. Let me list them:\n\nThe solutions s in [1,N] are given by the coprime divisor pairs. \n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k) with d*k=30. The distinct prime factors are 2,3,5. \n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k):\n\n(1,30), (2,15), (3,10), (5,6), (6,5), (10,3), (15,2), (30,1). \n\nEach of these gives a solution s. Let me compute each:\n\nFor pair (d,k):\n\n1. (1,30): solve s \u22610 mod1 (any s) and s\u22611 mod30 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod30 \u21d2 s=1,31,\u2026 But within 1-30, s=1.\n\n2. (2,15): solve s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod15. \n\nFind s \u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\nLet me solve s \u22611 mod15 and even. Let s=15m +1. Must be even \u21d215m +1 \u22610 mod2 \u21d215m \u22611 mod2 \u21d2m odd. So m=1 \u21d2s=16, m=3 \u21d2s=46>30. So only s=16 in 1-30.\n\n3. (3,10): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod10.\n\ns\u22611 mod10 \u21d2 s=10m +1. Must also \u22610 mod3 \u21d210m +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d210m \u2261-1 mod3 \u21d21*m \u22612 mod3 \u21d2m\u22612 mod3.\n\nSo m=2 \u21d2 s=21, m=5 \u21d251>30. So s=21.\n\n4. (5,6): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod6.\n\ns\u22611 mod6 \u21d2 s=6m +1. Must be \u22610 mod5 \u21d26m +1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d26m \u2261-1 mod5 \u21d26m\u22614 mod5 \u21d2m\u22614*(6^{-1} mod5). Since 6\u22611 mod5, inverse is 1. So m\u22614 mod5. \n\nm=4 \u21d2 s=25, m=9 \u21d255>30. So s=25.\n\n5. (6,5): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 s=5m +1. Must be \u22610 mod6 \u21d25m +1 \u22610 mod6 \u21d25m \u2261-1 mod6 \u21d25m\u22615 mod6 \u21d2m\u22611 mod6. \n\nm=1 \u21d2s=6, m=7 \u21d236>30. So s=6.\n\n6. (10,3): s\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns\u22611 mod3 \u21d2s=3m +1. Must be \u22610 mod10 \u21d23m +1 \u22610 mod10 \u21d23m\u2261-1 mod10 \u21d23m\u22619 mod10 \u21d2m\u22613 mod10. \n\nm=3 \u21d2 s=10, m=13 \u21d240>30. So s=10.\n\nWait, 3m +1=10? Let me check m=3: 3*3+1=10, yes. So s=10.\n\n7. (15,2): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod2.\n\ns\u22611 mod2 \u21d2s is odd. Also s\u22610 mod15 \u21d2s=15,45,\u2026 Within 1-30: s=15, 45 is over.\n\nCheck s=15: 15 is odd? No, 15 is odd. Wait 15 is odd? 15 is odd. Yes. So s=15.\n\nWait, s=15: 15 mod2=1, yes. So s=15 is solution.\n\n8. (30,1): s\u22610 mod30 and s\u22611 mod1 \u21d2any s\u22610 mod30. So s=30.\n\nThus the solutions in [1,30] are s=1,6,10,15,16,21,25,30. \n\nSo total 8 solutions. \n\nNow, the solutions above ceil(sqrt(31))=6. So starting from 6 to 30. \n\nThe solutions in this interval are s=6,10,15,16,21,25,30. That is 7 solutions. \n\nWait, s=6 is included (since ceil(sqrt(31))=6, so starting at 6). \n\nSo 7 solutions. Not exceeding 10. \n\nTherefore, N=30 gives 7 solutions. \n\nHmm. Let's try N=60 (which has factors 2^2*3*5, so \u03c9(N)=3, so total solutions 8). Wait, same as before. \n\nAlternatively, let's try N=210 (which has \u03c9=4 (2,3,5,7)), so 16 total solutions. Let's see:\n\nN=210, so b=211.\n\nCompute ceil(sqrt(211))\u224814.525, so ceil is 15.\n\nWe need to count solutions from 15 to 210. \n\nTotal solutions in [1,210] is 16. The solutions below 15 would be those s from 1 to14. Let me see how many there are. \n\nBut this might take time. Alternatively, maybe N= 2*3*5*7=210, but maybe there are smaller N with \u03c9=4?\n\nWait the minimal N with four distinct primes is 210, yes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a number like N= 2^3*3*5=120, which has \u03c9=3, so 8 solutions. \n\nAlternatively, let me check N= 2^3*3^2*5= 360, which also \u03c9=3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of going to four primes, maybe numbers with exponents but still more solutions. \n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The total solutions are 2^{\u03c9(N)}, so to get more than ten, need 2^{\u03c9(N)}>10, so \u03c9(N)>=4. Hence the minimal N is 210. \n\nBut let's check for N=210:\n\nTotal solutions 16. The number of solutions above ceil(sqrt(211))=15 is 16 minus solutions below 15. \n\nCompute solutions below 15:\n\nThe solutions in [1,14]. Let me list all solutions for N=210.\n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k) with d*k=210 and gcd(d,k)=1. Since N=2*3*5*7, the prime factors are 2,3,5,7. So the coprime pairs are all subsets of the prime factors assigned to d and the rest to k. \n\nThe number of such pairs is 2^4=16. Each corresponds to a unique s. Let me try to find all solutions s in [1,210].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's tedious, but let's try some of them:\n\nTake the pair (d,k)=(1,210). Solution s\u22610 mod1 and s\u22611 mod210 \u21d2 s=1 mod210 \u21d2 s=1.\n\nPair (2,105): s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod105. Solve s=105m +1 even. 105m must be odd, so m must be odd. m=1 \u21d2 s=106, m=3 \u21d2316>210. So s=106.\n\nPair (3,70): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod70. Let s=70m +1. Must be divisible by 3 \u21d270m +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d270\u22611 mod3 \u21d21*m +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d2m\u22612 mod3. m=2 \u21d2141, m=5 \u21d2351>210. So s=141.\n\nPair (5,42): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod42. s=42m +1 must be divisible by 5 \u21d242m +1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d242\u22612 mod5 \u21d22m +1 \u22610 \u21d22m\u2261-1\u22614 \u21d2m\u22612 mod5. m=2 \u21d285, m=7 \u21d2295>210. So s=85.\n\nPair (7,30): s\u22610 mod7 and s\u22611 mod30. s=30m +1. Must be divisible by7 \u21d230m +1 \u22610 mod7 \u21d230\u22612 mod7 \u21d22m +1\u22610 \u21d22m\u22616 \u21d2m\u22613 mod7. m=3 \u21d291, m=10 \u21d2301>210. So s=91.\n\nPair (6,35): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod35. s=35m +1 must be divisible by6. 35\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d2-m +1 \u22610 mod6 \u21d2-m\u2261-1 \u21d2m\u22611 mod6. m=1 \u21d236, m=7 \u21d2250>210. So s=36.\n\nWait, 35*1 +1=36, yes.\n\nPair (10,21): s\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod21. s=21m +1 divisible by10 \u21d221m +1\u22610 mod10 \u21d221\u22611 mod10 \u21d2m +1\u22610 mod10 \u21d2m\u22619 mod10. m=9 \u21d2190, m=19 \u21d2400>210. So s=190.\n\nPair (14,15): s\u22610 mod14 and s\u22611 mod15. s=15m +1 divisible by14 \u21d215m +1\u22610 mod14 \u21d215\u22611 mod14 \u21d2m +1\u22610 \u21d2m\u226113 mod14. m=13 \u21d2196, which is 15*13 +1=196. 196 mod14=0, yes. So s=196.\n\nSimilarly, other pairs like (15,14), (21,10), (30,7), (35,6), (42,5), (70,3), (105,2), (210,1). \n\nContinuing:\n\nPair (15,14): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod14. s=14m +1 divisible by15 \u21d214m +1\u22610 mod15 \u21d214m\u2261-1 mod15 \u21d214m\u226114 mod15 \u21d2m\u22611 mod15. m=1 \u21d215, m=16 \u21d2225>210. So s=15.\n\nWait, 14*1 +1=15. Yes, 15 mod14=1, so that works.\n\nPair (21,10): s\u22610 mod21 and s\u22611 mod10. s=10m +1 divisible by21 \u21d210m +1\u22610 mod21 \u21d210m\u2261-1 mod21 \u21d210m\u226120 mod21 \u21d2m\u22612 mod21 (since 10*2=20). m=2 \u21d221, m=23 \u21d2231>210. So s=21.\n\nPair (30,7): s\u22610 mod30 and s\u22611 mod7. s=7m +1 divisible by30 \u21d27m +1\u22610 mod30 \u21d27m\u2261-1 mod30 \u21d27m\u226129 mod30. 7 and 30 coprime. inverse of 7 mod30 is 13 since 7*13=91\u22611 mod30. So m\u226129*13 mod30. 29*13=377 mod30= 377-12*30=377-360=17 \u21d2 m\u226117 mod30. m=17 \u21d27*17+1=120, m=47 \u21d2330>210. So s=120.\n\nPair (35,6): s\u22610 mod35 and s\u22611 mod6. s=6m +1 divisible by35 \u21d26m +1\u22610 mod35 \u21d26m\u2261-1 mod35 \u21d26m\u226134 mod35 \u21d2m\u226134*(6^{-1} mod35). Find inverse of 6 mod35. 6*6=36\u22611 \u21d2 inverse is6. So m\u226134*6=204 mod35. 204 mod35: 35*5=175, 204-175=29 \u21d2m\u226129 mod35. m=29 \u21d26*29 +1=175. m=64 \u21d2385>210. So s=175.\n\nPair (42,5): s\u22610 mod42 and s\u22611 mod5. s=5m +1 divisible by42 \u21d25m +1\u22610 mod42 \u21d25m\u2261-1 mod42 \u21d25m\u226141 mod42. Inverse of 5 mod42 is 17 (5*17=85\u22611 mod42). So m\u226141*17 mod42. 41\u2261-1 mod42, so (-1)*17= -17 mod42 \u21d225 mod42. m=25 \u21d25*25+1=126. m=67 \u21d2336>210. So s=126.\n\nPair (70,3): s\u22610 mod70 and s\u22611 mod3. s=3m +1 divisible by70 \u21d23m +1\u22610 mod70 \u21d23m\u2261-1 mod70 \u21d23m\u226169 mod70 \u21d2m\u226123 mod70 (since 3*23=69). m=23 \u21d23*23+1=70. m=93 \u21d2280>210. So s=70.\n\nPair (105,2): s\u22610 mod105 and s\u22611 mod2. s must be even and divisible by105 \u21d2s=105*2=210, but 210 mod2=0, which is even. Wait, s=105*1=105, but 105 mod2=1. Wait, need s\u22611 mod2 \u21d2 odd. But 105 is odd. So s=105 is a solution. \n\nWait, solving s\u22610 mod105 and s\u22611 mod2 \u21d2 s=105 is odd? 105 is odd. So yes, s=105.\n\nPair (210,1): s\u22610 mod210 \u21d2 s=210.\n\nOkay, compiling all solutions in [1,210]:\n\n1,15,21,30,36,60,70,85,91,105,106,120,126,141,175,190,196,210.\n\nWait, let me list all the solutions I found:\n\nFrom the pairs:\n\n1. (1,210): 1\n\n2. (2,105):106\n\n3. (3,70):141\n\n4. (5,42):85\n\n5. (7,30):91\n\n6. (6,35):36\n\n7. (10,21):190\n\n8. (14,15):196\n\n9. (15,14):15\n\n10. (21,10):21\n\n11. (30,7):120\n\n12. (35,6):175\n\n13. (42,5):126\n\n14. (70,3):70\n\n15. (105,2):105\n\n16. (210,1):210\n\nWait, that's 16 solutions. So the solutions in [1,210] are: 1,15,21,36,70,85,91,105,106,120,126,141,175,190,196,210. \n\nNow, the lower bound is ceil(sqrt(211))=15. So solutions from 15 to210. \n\nSo excluding s=1 (which is below 15), the rest 15 solutions are from 15 to210. So the count is 15, which is more than ten. \n\nTherefore, N=210 gives 15 solutions above the threshold. So b=N+1=211 would be a candidate. \n\nBut the question is to find the least such b. Maybe there's a smaller N with \u03c9(N)=4 but with smaller N? \n\nWait, the minimal N with four distinct prime factors is 2*3*5*7=210, so that is the smallest. Therefore, N=210 is the minimal N where \u03c9(N)=4. So b=211 would be the minimal base where the count exceeds 10. \n\nWait, but maybe there is a smaller N with \u03c9(N)=3 but with more solutions above the threshold? \n\nLet me check for N=60 (\u03c9=3, primes 2,3,5). \n\nN=60, so b=61.\n\nCompute ceil(sqrt(61))\u22487.81, so ceil=8.\n\nTotal solutions in [1,60] are 8. Let me list them.\n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k) for N=60 (factors 2,3,5):\n\nThe coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,60), (2,30), (3,20), (4,15), (5,12), (6,10), (10,6), (12,5), (15,4), (20,3), (30,2), (60,1). Wait, but need to ensure that d and k are coprime. \n\nWait, N=60=2^2*3*5. The coprime pairs (d,k) must be such that gcd(d,k)=1. \n\nPossible coprime pairs:\n\nThe prime factors are 2,3,5. \n\nPossible assignments:\n\nEach prime can go to d or k, but not both. So:\n\nThe possible coprime pairs are formed by partitioning the prime factors between d and k. \n\nEach prime (2,3,5) can be in d or k. So 2^3=8 possibilities. \n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. d=1 (no primes), k=60 (all primes). \n\nSolution s\u22611 mod60.\n\n2. d=2 (prime 2), k=3*5=15. \n\nSolution s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\n3. d=3 (prime3), k=2^2*5=20. \n\nSolution s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod20.\n\n4. d=5 (prime5), k=2^2*3=12.\n\nSolution s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod12.\n\n5. d=2*3=6 (primes 2,3), k=5.\n\nSolution s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\n6. d=2*5=10 (primes2,5), k=3.\n\nSolution s\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\n7. d=3*5=15 (primes3,5), k=4 (2^2).\n\nSolution s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\n8. d=2*3*5=30, k=2 (but wait, 2 is already in d). Wait no, d=30 would include all primes, so k=2^2/2? Hmm, perhaps I need to re-express.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of each coprime pair as choosing a subset of the primes for d, and the complement for k. \n\nThus, for each subset S of the prime factors {2,3,5}, assign d= product of primes in S, and k= product of primes not in S. Then, d and k are coprime, and d*k = N only if the exponents are considered. Wait, but N=60=2^2*3*5. \n\nWait, actually, the coprime pairs (d,k) must multiply to N, and be coprime. \n\nTherefore, the exponents in d and k must be such that for each prime, its exponent is entirely in d or in k. \n\nTherefore, for each prime, we decide whether it goes to d or to k. \n\nFor example, for prime 2 (with exponent 2), we can assign all its exponent to d or to k. Similarly for primes 3 and 5 (each exponent 1). \n\nTherefore, the coprime pairs (d,k) are determined by the choice for each prime (including their exponents) to be in d or k. \n\nThus, for prime 2: assign to d or k (but since exponent is 2, if assigned to d, d gets 2^2, if to k, then k gets 2^2).\n\nSimilarly for primes 3 and 5: assign to d or k. \n\nThus the number of coprime pairs is 2^3=8 (since three primes), as before. \n\nLet me compute the solutions:\n\n1. (1,60): s\u22611 mod60 \u21d2 s=1.\n\n2. (2,30): s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod30. \n\nSolve s=30m+1 even. 30m must be odd \u21d2 m odd. m=1 \u21d2 s=31, m=3 \u21d291>60. So s=31.\n\n3. (3,20): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod20. \n\ns=20m +1 divisible by3 \u21d220m +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 \u21d22m +1\u22610 \u21d22m\u22612 \u21d2m\u22611 mod3. \n\nm=1 \u21d221, m=4 \u21d281>60. So s=21.\n\n4. (5,12): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod12. \n\ns=12m +1 divisible by5 \u21d212m +1\u22610 mod5 \u21d212\u22612 \u21d22m +1\u22610 \u21d22m\u22614 \u21d2m\u22612 mod5. \n\nm=2 \u21d225, m=7 \u21d285>60. So s=25.\n\n5. (6,10): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod10. \n\ns=10m +1 divisible by6 \u21d210m +1\u22610 mod6 \u21d210\u22614 \u21d24m +1\u22610 \u21d24m\u22615 \u21d24m\u22615 mod6 \u21d22m\u22612.5 \u21d2 Wait, 4m \u22615 mod6 \u21d24m \u22615 mod6. Since 4 and6 are not coprime, check if 5 divisible by gcd(4,6)=2? 5 mod2=1, so no solution. \n\nWait, contradiction. Hmm, so no solution? That can't be.\n\nWait, maybe made a mistake here. Let me solve s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod10.\n\nLet me write s=6k. Then 6k \u22611 mod10 \u21d26k \u22611 mod10 \u21d26k mod10=1 \u21d2k must satisfy 6k mod10=1. \n\n6 and10 have gcd 2. So 6k \u22611 mod10 \u21d2 equation has solution only if gcd(6,10) divides 1 \u21d22 divides1 \u21d2 no solution. So this pair (6,10) does not yield a solution. \n\nHmm, so this pair actually has no solution? But according to earlier reasoning, each coprime pair should give a solution. \n\nWait, but (6,10): gcd(6,10)=2\u22601. So perhaps my mistake earlier was in considering (d,k) with gcd(d,k)=1, but here d=6 and k=10 have gcd 2. \n\nWait, that's a problem! \n\nWait, the coprime pairs must have gcd(d,k)=1. So in this case, d=6 and k=10 have gcd 2, so they are not coprime. So this pair is invalid. \n\nAh! So my mistake earlier was not ensuring that d and k are coprime. \n\nTherefore, the coprime pairs must satisfy gcd(d,k)=1. \n\nTherefore, when forming the pairs, after choosing which primes go to d and which to k, we must have that the exponents are such that the primes are separated. \n\nWait, in the case of N=60=2^2*3*5, when we choose to assign prime2 to d and primes3,5 to k, then d=2^2=4 and k=3*5=15 \u21d2 gcd(4,15)=1. \n\nBut in the case where we assign primes2 and3 to d, and prime5 to k, then d=2^2*3=12 and k=5 \u21d2 gcd(12,5)=1. \n\nHowever, if we assign primes2 and3 to d, and prime5 to k, then d=2^2*3=12, k=5 \u21d2 gcd(12,5)=1. \n\nWait, but in the case where we assigned primes2 and3 to d, then k would be 5, which is okay. \n\nWait, the problem was with the pair (6,10). Let's see: \n\nIf d=6 (which includes primes2 and3), then k would have to be N/d=60/6=10. But 10 includes prime2 and5. Since prime2 is already in d, so d and k share prime2 \u21d2 gcd(d,k)=2\u22601. \n\nTherefore, that pair is invalid. \n\nThus, when forming the coprime pairs (d,k), we must ensure that d and k are coprime. \n\nTherefore, the correct coprime pairs for N=60 are only those where the chosen subsets of primes for d and k are such that they don't share any primes. \n\nTherefore, for each prime, you choose to put it entirely in d or in k. \n\nThus, for each prime, you have two choices, so 2^3=8 pairs, but some of them may have d or k as 1. \n\nWait, but when you choose a subset of primes for d, then k is the product of the remaining primes. Since each prime is either in d or k, they are coprime. \n\nThus, the correct coprime pairs are indeed 8, but in the case of N=60, some of the pairs may have d or k with exponents. \n\nWait, let me recompute the coprime pairs properly. \n\nThe prime factors are 2,3,5. \n\nEach prime must be assigned entirely to d or k. \n\nSo:\n\n1. Assign none to d: d=1, k=2^2*3*5=60 \u21d2 (1,60)\n\n2. Assign 2 to d: d=2^2=4, k=3*5=15 \u21d2 (4,15)\n\n3. Assign3 to d: d=3, k=2^2*5=20 \u21d2 (3,20)\n\n4. Assign5 to d: d=5, k=2^2*3=12 \u21d2 (5,12)\n\n5. Assign 2 and3 to d: d=2^2*3=12, k=5 \u21d2 (12,5)\n\n6. Assign2 and5 to d: d=2^2*5=20, k=3 \u21d2 (20,3)\n\n7. Assign3 and5 to d: d=3*5=15, k=2^2=4 \u21d2 (15,4)\n\n8. Assign all primes to d: d=2^2*3*5=60, k=1 \u21d2 (60,1)\n\nSo these are the 8 coprime pairs. \n\nNow, the invalid pair I considered earlier (6,10) is not actually a valid coprime pair because it would require assigning some primes to both d and k. \n\nTherefore, now, let's compute solutions for these valid pairs:\n\n1. (1,60): s=1 mod60 \u21d2 s=1.\n\n2. (4,15): s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\nSolve s=15m +1 \u22610 mod4 \u21d215m +1 \u22613m +1 \u22610 mod4 \u21d23m\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d23m\u22613 mod4 \u21d2m\u22611 mod4. \n\nm=1 \u21d216, m=5 \u21d280>60 \u21d2 s=16.\n\n3.

That would have \u03c9=4 (primes 2,3,5,7). So total solutions 16. \n\nBut N=420 is bigger than 210, so 210 is still better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a number like N= 2*3*5*11= 330. That's higher than 210, so not better. \n\nThus, the minimal N is 210. \n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smaller N with \u03c9=4 but not minimal prime factors? \n\nWait, the minimal is 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210. \n\nHence, the answer should be 211. \n\nHowever, let me check N= 120 (\u03c9=3) but with some other consideration? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the N=210 count. Let me recheck:\n\nFor N=210, the solutions above ceil(sqrt(211))=15 are all except s=1. \n\nThe solutions are:\n\n1,15,21,36,70,85,91,105,106,120,126,141,175,190,196,210. \n\nExcluding s=1, that's 15 solutions. \n\nYes, so 15 >10. \n\nTherefore, the minimal b is 211. \n\nWait, but the problem states \"the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers\". \n\nTherefore, the answer is 211. \n\nHowever, the problem might have a smaller answer. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases where N has a higher number of solutions without having four prime factors. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that when N has exponents, even with \u03c9=3, the number of solutions can be higher? \n\nWait, let me try N= 60 (\u03c9=3). \n\nWait, in N=60, total solutions are 8, so above sqrt(N+1)=~8, giving 7 solutions. \n\nWait, but maybe there is a number with \u03c9=3 where the number of solutions above the threshold is higher. \n\nWait, let me try N= 105 (\u03c9=3). \n\nTotal solutions 8. Above ceil(sqrt(106))=11, there are 7 solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, N= 2*3*5*7=210 is indeed the first with \u03c9=4. \n\nThus, the minimal b is 211. \n\nWait, but let me check another case where N= 30 (\u03c9=3). \n\nWait, but for N=30, we had 7 solutions above the threshold. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me check N= 240 (which is 2^4*3*5, \u03c9=3).

The problem says \"the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\" So the minimal b where the count exceeds ten. \n\nWait, perhaps there is a number with \u03c9=4 but smaller than 210? \n\nWait, the product of the first four primes is 2*3*5*7=210. \n\nThere are no smaller numbers with four distinct prime factors. \n\nTherefore, yes, the minimal N is 210, so the minimal b is 211. \n\nHence, I think the final answer is 211.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{211}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about finding the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me try to understand what a b-eautiful number is first. \n\nThe problem says a positive integer n is b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when you write n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. The example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, it's written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. That makes sense. \n\nSo, my task is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's formalize the conditions. If n is a two-digit number in base b, then n can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are the digits. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a must be at least 1 and at most b-1 (since base b digits go from 0 to b-1, but the first digit can't be 0). The second digit c can be from 0 to b-1. \n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals the square root of n. So, a + c = \u221an. But since n = a*b + c, substituting that in gives a + c = \u221a(a*b + c). \n\nSo, our equation to solve is:\n\na + c = \u221a(a*b + c)\n\nWe need to find all pairs (a, c) where a is from 1 to b-1, c from 0 to b-1, such that the above equation holds. Each such pair corresponds to a unique n, which is a*b + c. \n\nOur goal is to find the smallest b where the number of such (a, c) pairs exceeds ten.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe rearrange the equation to make it easier to handle?\n\nStarting with:\n\na + c = \u221a(a*b + c)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root. That would give:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nLet's bring all terms to one side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, this seems a bit complicated. Maybe rearrange terms:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe group terms differently. Let's see:\n\na\u00b2 - a*b + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms with a:\n\na(a - b + 2c) + c(c - 1) = 0\n\nNot sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Let's try to write the equation as:\n\na*b = (a + c)^2 - c\n\nWait, starting again:\n\nOriginal equation after squaring: (a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nTherefore, a*b = (a + c)^2 - c = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c\n\nThus, a*b = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c\n\nThen, rearranged:\n\na*b - a\u00b2 - 2ac - c\u00b2 + c = 0\n\nHmm. Alternatively, maybe express in terms of variables. Let me think of variables a and c with constraints 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express c in terms of a or vice versa.\n\nLet me try to express c in terms of a. Let me denote s = a + c, so s = \u221an. Since n = a*b + c, s\u00b2 = a*b + c. \n\nBut since s = a + c, then substituting c = s - a into the second equation gives:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + (s - a)\n\nSo:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + s - a\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\ns\u00b2 - s - a*b + a = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps factor terms with a:\n\ns\u00b2 - s - a(b - 1) = 0\n\nThen, solving for a:\n\na(b - 1) = s\u00b2 - s\n\nThus,\n\na = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nHmm, interesting. So for a to be an integer between 1 and b-1, the right-hand side must be an integer and satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1.\n\nAlso, since c = s - a must also be between 0 and b -1, so c = s - a must be \u22650 and \u2264 b -1.\n\nTherefore, let me note down the constraints:\n\n1. a must be an integer in [1, b-1]\n\n2. c = s - a must be an integer in [0, b-1]\n\n3. s = a + c must satisfy s\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nBut from the above, we can express a in terms of s and b:\n\na = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1)\n\nTherefore, for a to be integer, (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Also, since a must be positive, s\u00b2 - s must be positive, so s(s -1 ) >0, so s \u22652 (since s is a positive integer, as it's the sum of digits a and c which are non-negative, but since a \u22651, s must be at least 1, but actually, since c can be 0, s could be a +0 = a \u22651. However, s is sqrt(n), which must be an integer, so n must be a perfect square. So s is an integer, and n = s\u00b2. \n\nTherefore, s must be an integer, and n = s\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b. So, n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and b\u00b2 -1 (the largest two-digit number, which is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1). \n\nTherefore, s\u00b2 must satisfy b \u2264 s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1. Since s is the square root of n, s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is less than b, so s can go up to b-1. So s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1. Wait, but s is the square root of n which is two-digit in base b. The minimal n is b, so s must be at least sqrt(b). Since s must be integer, the minimal s is ceiling(sqrt(b)), and the maximum s is floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)) which is b-1. \n\nTherefore, s can range from ceiling(sqrt(b)) to b -1. \n\nSo, for each s in that interval, we can check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). If yes, then a is (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), and then c = s - a. Then, check if c is between 0 and b -1, and also check that a is between 1 and b-1. \n\nAlternatively, since a and c are determined once s and b are given, perhaps we can structure this as follows:\n\nFor a given base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that:\n\n1. (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), i.e., (s\u00b2 - s) mod (b -1) =0,\n\n2. a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1,\n\n3. c = s - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b -1.\n\nTherefore, for each s in that range, we can check these conditions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can reorganize the equation to express b in terms of s and a. Let me see:\n\nFrom a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), we can write:\n\nb -1 = (s\u00b2 - s)/a\n\nThus,\n\nb = (s\u00b2 - s)/a +1\n\nSo, since b must be an integer greater than or equal to 2, for each s and a, this gives a possible b. However, since we are looking for a particular b and the number of s's (or a's) that satisfy this, perhaps this is more useful when considering for a given s and a, what b would allow that, but maybe not directly helpful for counting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of the problem as for each b, iterate over possible s from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, and for each s, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), then compute a and c, check their validity. \n\nBut since we need to find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps we can find a way to compute the number of solutions for a given b and then find when it exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps find a formula for the number of solutions in terms of b. Let me see.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote that for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and then a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1) must be an integer between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a must be between 0 and b -1.\n\nAlternatively, since a must be between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1, then combining these:\n\nc = s - a \u22650 => a \u2264 s,\n\nand c = s -a \u2264 b-1 => a \u2265 s - (b-1).\n\nBut since a is at least 1, so s - (b-1) \u2264 a \u2264 s,\n\nand also a must be between 1 and b -1.\n\nTherefore, the constraints on a are:\n\nmax(1, s - (b -1)) \u2264 a \u2264 min(b -1, s)\n\nBut since a must also equal (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), which is a specific value. So for each s, either (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1) or not, and if it is, then a is fixed as (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). So we need to check if that a is within the required range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps to rephrase, for a given s and b, a is uniquely determined as (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1). Therefore, for each s in the range, if this a is an integer between 1 and b-1, and c = s -a is between 0 and b-1, then it counts as a solution.\n\nBut given that c = s - a, and a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), substituting gives c = s - (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Let me see:\n\nc = s - (s(s -1))/(b -1) \n\nHmm, so c has to be an integer between 0 and b-1. Since a is already an integer (because (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by b-1 for a to be integer), then c will also be an integer because s and a are integers.\n\nTherefore, the key conditions are:\n\n1. (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1).\n\n2. The resulting a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1.\n\n3. c = s - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b -1.\n\nBut since a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), the first condition is the critical one. Let me see if I can find a way to count the number of s for a given b that satisfy this.\n\nAlternatively, since s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b-1, perhaps for each b, the number of s's such that (s\u00b2 - s) mod (b-1) = 0.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of this as a quadratic in s. Let me see:\n\nWe can write s\u00b2 - s \u2261 0 mod (b -1). So s(s - 1) \u2261 0 mod (b -1). \n\nTherefore, for each s, s(s -1) must be divisible by (b -1). So (b -1) divides s(s -1).\n\nTherefore, for each s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, check if (b-1) divides s(s -1). \n\nHmm, so this is equivalent to s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b-1). Therefore, the number of s in that interval where s and s-1 are such that their product is divisible by (b-1).\n\nAlternatively, since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. So their GCD is 1. Therefore, for their product to be divisible by (b-1), the factors of (b-1) must be distributed between s and s-1. Since they are coprime, one of them must be divisible by each prime power in (b-1)'s factorization. \n\nAlternatively, this might not be straightforward. Maybe instead of trying to find a formula, it's better to think of possible values of b and compute the number of solutions for each, until we find the first one with more than ten.\n\nBut since the problem asks for the minimal b where this happens, maybe we can find a pattern or a way to calculate how the number of solutions grows with b.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that for each s between 1 and b-1, but actually s starts at ceil(sqrt(b)), so the lower limit is higher. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that s(s -1) is divisible by (b -1). \n\nLet me think of an example. Let's take b=13 as in the problem's example. Then b-1=12. The s must be between ceil(sqrt(13)) = 4 and 12. So s from 4 to 12. Now, for each s in 4 to 12, check if s(s-1) is divisible by 12.\n\nLet me see:\n\ns=4: 4*3=12, which is divisible by 12. So yes. Then a=(16 -4)/12=12/12=1. Then c=4-1=3. So n=1*13 +3=16? Wait, but the example said 81 is 13-eautiful. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, in the example, 81 is 63 in base 13. 6*13 +3=81. So s should be sqrt(81)=9. So s=9. Let me check s=9 for b=13. \n\ns=9: 9*8=72. 72 divided by 12 (b-1=12) is 6. So a= (81 -9)/12 =72/12=6. Then c=9 -6=3. That's correct. So yes, s=9 is a solution. \n\nSo for b=13, how many solutions are there? Let's check all s from 4 to 12:\n\ns=4: 4*3=12 divisible by 12. So a= (16-4)/12=1. Then c=3. So n=1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4, which is s=4. So that's valid. \n\ns=5: 5*4=20. 20 mod 12 is 8, so not divisible by 12. So no.\n\ns=6: 6*5=30 mod12 is 6. Not divisible.\n\ns=7: 7*6=42 mod12 is 6. Not divisible.\n\ns=8:8*7=56 mod12= 56-48=8. Not divisible.\n\ns=9: 9*8=72 divisible by 12. So yes, as above.\n\ns=10:10*9=90 mod12: 90-72=18 mod12=6. Not divisible.\n\ns=11:11*10=110 mod12: 110-96=14 mod12=2. Not divisible.\n\ns=12:12*11=132 mod12=0. So yes. \n\nWait, s=12. Let's check:\n\na=(144 -12)/12=132/12=11. Since b=13, a=11 is allowed (since a must be \u226412). Then c=12 -11=1. Then n=11*13 +1=143. sqrt(143) is about 11.96, not an integer. Wait, but s is supposed to be sqrt(n). Wait, s=12, so sqrt(n)=12, so n=144. Wait, but 11*13 +1=143, which is not 144. Wait, this is a problem. Did I do something wrong?\n\nHold on, maybe my mistake here. Let's check the calculation again.\n\nIf s=12, then n = s\u00b2 = 144. To write 144 in base 13: 13^2 is 169, which is more than 144. So the two-digit number would be (a,b) where a*13 + c =144. So a is the first digit: 144 divided by 13 is 11 with remainder 1 (since 11*13=143, 144-143=1). So indeed, the digits are 11 and 1. Their sum is 12, which is sqrt(144)=12. So that works. But in my previous calculation, I thought of c as s -a, which would be 12-11=1, so that's correct. So n is indeed 11*13 +1=144. Wait, 11*13 is 143 +1 is 144. Right, so that works. So s=12 is valid. \n\nSo for b=13, s=4,9,12. So three solutions? Wait, but in the example, 81 is one of them, but there are two others: 16 and 144. Wait, so actually, three numbers. But the problem says 81 is 13-eautiful, so that's one of them. So for b=13, there are three b-eautiful numbers. Hmm, so the count is three. \n\nWait, but maybe I missed some s?\n\nLet me check s=3. Wait, s must be at least ceil(sqrt(13)) which is 4, so s=3 is too low. So s starts at 4. So 4,9,12. So three numbers. \n\nTherefore, for b=13, there are three solutions. \n\nSo the problem wants the first b where the number of solutions exceeds 10. Let's see. \n\nTherefore, perhaps trying to find for different values of b, compute the number of solutions. Since the problem is asking for the minimal b where this count is more than ten, perhaps we can find an approach that allows us to compute this without brute-forcing all bases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the equation s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, as consecutive integers, then (b-1) must divide the product s(s-1). Since they are coprime, (b-1) must divide either s or s-1, but not necessarily exactly one. Wait, actually, since they are coprime, the factors of (b-1) must be partitioned between s and s-1. \n\nTherefore, (b-1) can be written as d1*d2 where d1 divides s and d2 divides (s-1), with gcd(d1,d2)=1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of (b-1) as a factor that must divide either s or s-1, but not necessarily entirely. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of possible divisors of (b-1). For each divisor d of (b-1), then s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod (b-1/d). Wait, maybe this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, note that for each s, the condition is that (b-1) divides s(s-1). Therefore, for each s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1], if s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1), then that s gives a solution. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in that interval where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that for s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], the values of s(s-1) can be considered modulo (b-1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's easier to think of (b-1) as N, so N = b-1. Then, the problem becomes for N \u22651 (since b\u22652), find the minimal N+1 (so b) such that the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(N+1)), N] where s(s-1) \u22610 mod N exceeds 10. \n\nSo perhaps let me rephrase variables: Let N = b -1, so b = N+1. Then, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(N+1)), N] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod N must be greater than 10. We need to find the smallest N where this holds, then add 1 to get b. \n\nHmm, maybe that's a better way. Let me see.\n\nSo now, the problem is in terms of N. Let me see if this helps.\n\nWe need to find the minimal N \u22651 such that the number of integers s with ceil(sqrt(N+1)) \u2264 s \u2264 N and s(s-1) \u22610 mod N exceeds 10. Then b=N+1 is the answer.\n\nNow, perhaps this is a better way to approach. Let me see if I can find a pattern here.\n\nNote that s(s -1) \u22610 mod N implies that N divides s(s-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, the prime factors of N must be distributed between s and s-1. So, for each prime power dividing N, it divides either s or s-1 but not both. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(N+1)), N] such that s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod d, where d is a factor? Hmm, not exactly, but perhaps the number of s in that interval where s \u22610 mod some divisor of N, or s\u22611 mod some divisor?\n\nAlternatively, since s and s-1 are coprime, the condition N divides s(s-1) is equivalent to N divides s(s-1), and since gcd(s,s-1)=1, this implies that N must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1. \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of N, such that d divides s and N/d divides (s-1), then s must satisfy s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (N/d). \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of N, there is a solution s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (N/d). The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that if d and N/d are coprime, then there is a unique solution mod N. \n\nHowever, since d and N/d may not be coprime, the congruence may not have a solution. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's complicated. Maybe instead of going this route, think of the number of solutions s in [1, N] where s(s-1) \u22610 mod N, and then subtract those s less than ceil(sqrt(N+1)). \n\nWait, maybe first count the number of s in [1, N] where s(s-1) \u22610 mod N, then subtract those s less than ceil(sqrt(N+1)), and then require that the remaining count is >10. \n\nBut how to count the number of s in [1,N] with s(s-1) \u22610 mod N?\n\nAlternatively, note that s(s-1) \u22610 mod N iff either s \u22610 mod N or s \u22611 mod N, or some combination where the factors of N divide s or s-1. Wait, no, that's not exactly. For example, if N=6, then s(s-1) must be divisible by 6. So s must be divisible by 2 or 3, and s-1 must be divisible by the remaining factors? Not exactly. Let me see with N=6:\n\nPossible s from 1 to 6:\n\ns=1: 1*0=0 mod6. So yes.\n\ns=2: 2*1=2 mod6\u22600.\n\ns=3:3*2=6\u22610 mod6. Yes.\n\ns=4:4*3=12\u22610 mod6. Yes.\n\ns=5:5*4=20\u22612 mod6\u22600.\n\ns=6:6*5=30\u22610 mod6. Yes.\n\nSo s=1,3,4,6. So 4 solutions. \n\nBut N=6, so the solutions are s=1,3,4,6. \n\nSo the count is 4. \n\nThus, for N=6, the number of solutions in [1,N] is 4. \n\nTherefore, perhaps the total number of solutions in [1,N] is equal to the number of divisors or something else?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of N? Not exactly. For N=6, divisors are 1,2,3,6. But the solutions were 4, which is equal to the number of divisors. Hmm, interesting. \n\nWait, let's check with another N. Let's take N=4.\n\nN=4:\n\ns from 1 to4:\n\ns=1:0 mod4? 1*0=0 mod4? Yes, 0 mod4.\n\ns=2:2*1=2 mod4\u22600.\n\ns=3:3*2=6\u22612 mod4\u22600.\n\ns=4:4*3=12\u22610 mod4.\n\nThus solutions are s=1 and 4. So 2 solutions. Divisors of 4 are 1,2,4. So three divisors, but solutions are 2. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe not exactly. Let's see N=3:\n\nN=3:\n\ns=1:0 mod3? yes (0).\n\ns=2:2*1=2 mod3\u22600.\n\ns=3:3*2=6\u22610 mod3. So solutions are s=1,3. Two solutions. Divisors of 3 are 1,3. So again two, so matches here.\n\nHmm. N=5:\n\nN=5:\n\ns from1-5:\n\ns=1:0 mod5.\n\ns=2:2 mod5\u22600.\n\ns=3:6 mod5=1\u22600.\n\ns=4:12 mod5=2\u22600.\n\ns=5:20 mod5=0.\n\nThus solutions s=1,5. So two solutions. Divisors are 1,5. So matches again. \n\nHmm, N=8:\n\nN=8:\n\ns from1-8:\n\ns=1:0 mod8.\n\ns=2:2 mod8\u22600.\n\ns=3:6 mod8\u22600.\n\ns=4:12 mod8=4\u22600.\n\ns=5:20 mod8=4\u22600.\n\ns=6:30 mod8=6\u22600.\n\ns=7:42 mod8=2\u22600.\n\ns=8:56 mod8=0.\n\nThus solutions s=1 and 8. Two solutions. Divisors of 8:1,2,4,8. So four divisors, but only two solutions. Hmm, so that breaks the pattern. \n\nHmm. So maybe for prime N, it works, but not for composite. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of N that are less than or equal to sqrt(N)? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s in [1,N] where s(s-1)\u22610 mod N is equal to the number of divisors of N plus 1? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, let me see another example. Take N=12 (so b=13, as in the problem). Then the number of solutions in [1,12]:\n\ns from1-12:\n\ns=1:0 mod12 yes.\n\ns=2:2 mod12 no.\n\ns=3:6 mod12 no.\n\ns=4:12 mod12=0 yes.\n\ns=5:20 mod12=8 no.\n\ns=6:30 mod12=6 no.\n\ns=7:42 mod12=6 no.\n\ns=8:56 mod12=8 no.\n\ns=9:72 mod12=0 yes.\n\ns=10:90 mod12=6 no.\n\ns=11:110 mod12=10 no.\n\ns=12:132 mod12=0 yes.\n\nThus solutions are s=1,4,9,12. Four solutions. So for N=12, four solutions. Divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. So six divisors, but only four solutions. Hmm. \n\nWait, so maybe the count is equal to the number of integers s in [1,N] where s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod (N/d) for some divisor d of N? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of solutions s is equal to the number of pairs (d, m) where d divides N and m is the solution mod N? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps this approach is getting too convoluted. Maybe instead, for each N, the number of solutions in [1,N] is equal to the number of s where s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod (N/d) for some d dividing N. But this might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s in [1,N] is equal to the number of divisors of N plus 1? Not exactly. For N=6, it was 4, divisors are 4, so that matches. For N=12, divisors are 6, solutions are 4. Hmm, no. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another way. Let me think again. \n\nThe equation is s(s-1) \u22610 mod N. Since s and s-1 are coprime, this means that N must be a factor of s*(s-1). Since gcd(s,s-1)=1, then N must be a product of two coprime factors, one dividing s and the other dividing s-1. \n\nTherefore, each divisor d of N gives rise to a solution where d divides s and N/d divides s-1, provided that d and N/d are coprime. \n\nWait, since d divides N, then N = d * k, so k = N/d. Then, if d and k are coprime, then by Chinese Remainder Theorem, there exists a unique solution modulo N to the system:\n\ns \u22610 mod d,\n\ns \u22611 mod k.\n\nTherefore, for each pair (d, k) where d*k = N and gcd(d,k)=1, there is a unique solution mod N. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions mod N is equal to the number of such pairs (d, k) with d*k=N and gcd(d,k)=1. Since each such pair corresponds to a unique solution. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s in [1,N] is equal to the number of such coprime pairs (d, k) with d*k=N, plus possibly 1? Wait, let me see.\n\nWait, actually, each coprime pair (d, k) with d*k=N gives exactly one solution modulo N. So the total number of solutions in [1,N] is exactly equal to the number of such coprime pairs (d,k). \n\nBut since d and k are divisors of N with d*k=N and gcd(d,k)=1, the number of such pairs is equal to 2^{\u03c9(N)}, where \u03c9(N) is the number of distinct prime factors of N. Because for each prime factor, you have to choose whether it goes to d or to k. Since they have to be coprime, each prime can only go to one of them. \n\nWait, that seems correct. For example, if N is a prime power, say p^e, then the only coprime pairs (d,k) with d*k=N are (1,N) and (N,1). However, gcd(1,N)=1 and gcd(N,1)=1. But since d and k must multiply to N, so for N=p^e, the coprime pairs are (1, p^e) and (p^e,1). Thus two pairs, so number of solutions is 2. Which matches with previous examples. For example, N=3 (prime), solutions s=1 and 3. \n\nSimilarly, N=4 (which is 2^2), coprime pairs (1,4) and (4,1). So two solutions, which matches. \n\nFor N=6 (which is 2*3), the coprime pairs would be (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). Wait, but gcd(2,3)=1, so (2,3) is a valid pair, as well as (3,2). So total of 4 pairs. Therefore, the number of solutions should be 4, which matches the example with N=6 (solutions 1,3,4,6). \n\nSimilarly, for N=12 (which factors into 2^2*3), the number of coprime pairs (d,k) with d*k=12 would be 2^{number of prime factors}. Since prime factors are 2 and 3, so 2 primes, so 2^2=4. Let's see:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k):\n\n(1,12), (12,1),\n\n(3,4), (4,3),\n\nWait, 3 and 4 are coprime, and 3*4=12. Similarly, 2 and 6 are not coprime. 2*6=12 but gcd(2,6)=2\u22601. Similarly, 6 and 2 same. \n\nWait, so actually:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k) where d*k=12:\n\n- (1,12)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (12,1)\n\nSo total of four pairs. Therefore, four solutions, which matches the N=12 case (s=1,4,9,12). \n\nTherefore, the formula is that the number of solutions s in [1,N] is equal to 2^{\u03c9(N)}, where \u03c9(N) is the number of distinct prime factors of N. Wait, but for N=12, which has two distinct primes (2 and 3), we have 2^2=4 solutions, which matches. For N=6 (two primes), 4 solutions. For N=3 (one prime), 2 solutions. For N=8 (one prime, 2^3), two solutions. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions in [1,N] is indeed 2^{\u03c9(N)}. \n\nWait, but N=1? Let me check N=1. Then \u03c9(1)=0, so 2^0=1. Solutions s=1. Indeed, s(s-1)=0 mod1, which is always true, so s can be 1. \n\nTherefore, the formula seems to hold. So the number of solutions s in [1,N] is 2^{\u03c9(N)}. \n\nTherefore, this is a key insight. \n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions in [1,N] is 2^{\u03c9(N)}. \n\nTherefore, to compute the number of solutions in [ceil(sqrt(N+1)), N], we can take 2^{\u03c9(N)} minus the number of solutions s in [1, ceil(sqrt(N+1)) -1]. \n\nSo the total desired count is:\n\nNumber of solutions = 2^{\u03c9(N)} - (number of solutions s in [1, ceil(sqrt(N+1)) -1])\n\nBut we need this number to be greater than 10. \n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal N where:\n\n2^{\u03c9(N)} - (number of solutions s in [1, L-1]) >10, where L = ceil(sqrt(N+1))\n\nBut this still requires knowing the number of solutions below L, which complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for large enough N, the number of solutions in the lower interval is small compared to 2^{\u03c9(N)}. So maybe if 2^{\u03c9(N)} exceeds 10, then it might work? But let's see.\n\nWait, for example, if \u03c9(N) is 4, then 2^4=16. So 16 solutions total. But we need more than 10 above ceil(sqrt(N+1)). So if the lower part has less than 6, then it's okay. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions below ceil(sqrt(N+1)) is negligible for large N. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal N where 2^{\u03c9(N)} exceeds 10? Let's see:\n\n2^{\u03c9(N)} >10 \u21d2 \u03c9(N) \u22654, since 2^3=8 <10, 2^4=16>10. \n\nSo if N has at least four distinct prime factors, then the total number of solutions is at least 16. But then we have to subtract the solutions below ceil(sqrt(N+1)), but maybe that's small. \n\nHowever, we need to ensure that the count above the sqrt(N+1) is more than 10. So even if total is 16, but subtract maybe 5, then 11 is sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal N with \u03c9(N)\u22654? Let's see the minimal N with four distinct prime factors is 2*3*5*7=210. But that might be too large. \n\nAlternatively, maybe N can have multiple exponents but still have \u03c9(N)=4. \n\nWait, but maybe there's a better approach. Since we need the number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(N+1)), N] to exceed 10, and the total solutions are 2^{\u03c9(N)}, then perhaps for N where 2^{\u03c9(N)} - (number of solutions below sqrt(N+1)) >10, so maybe even if \u03c9(N) is 4, but N is not too large so that the lower solutions are few. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can approximate:\n\nAssuming that the number of solutions below sqrt(N) is roughly proportional to sqrt(N)/N * total solutions? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of trying to compute this abstractly, let's try plugging in values of N and compute the required counts until we find the minimal N where the count exceeds 10. \n\nSince the problem is looking for the minimal b, which is N+1, we need to find the minimal N where the count is over 10, then add 1. \n\nLet me start testing N values incrementally. Let's start from small N and go up until the count exceeds 10.\n\nFirst, let me note that the formula for the number of solutions in [1,N] is 2^{\u03c9(N)}, so the total solutions are 2^{number of distinct prime factors of N}. \n\nTherefore, to get a large number of solutions, N must have many distinct prime factors. \n\nLet me start with N=30 (which has \u03c9(N)=3 (2,3,5)), so total solutions 8. \n\nBut need to compute the actual count above ceil(sqrt(N+1)). Let me compute for N=30.\n\nFirst, N=30, so b=31. \n\nceil(sqrt(N+1)) = ceil(sqrt(31))\u22485.564, so ceil is 6. \n\nSo we need to count solutions s from 6 to 30. \n\nTotal solutions in [1,30] are 2^{3}=8. \n\nNow, solutions in [1,5]. Let me list them:\n\nThe solutions s in [1,N] are given by the coprime divisor pairs. \n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k) with d*k=30. The distinct prime factors are 2,3,5. \n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k):\n\n(1,30), (2,15), (3,10), (5,6), (6,5), (10,3), (15,2), (30,1). \n\nEach of these gives a solution s. Let me compute each:\n\nFor pair (d,k):\n\n1. (1,30): solve s \u22610 mod1 (any s) and s\u22611 mod30 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod30 \u21d2 s=1,31,\u2026 But within 1-30, s=1.\n\n2. (2,15): solve s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod15. \n\nFind s \u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\nLet me solve s \u22611 mod15 and even. Let s=15m +1. Must be even \u21d215m +1 \u22610 mod2 \u21d215m \u22611 mod2 \u21d2m odd. So m=1 \u21d2s=16, m=3 \u21d2s=46>30. So only s=16 in 1-30.\n\n3. (3,10): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod10.\n\ns\u22611 mod10 \u21d2 s=10m +1. Must also \u22610 mod3 \u21d210m +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d210m \u2261-1 mod3 \u21d21*m \u22612 mod3 \u21d2m\u22612 mod3.\n\nSo m=2 \u21d2 s=21, m=5 \u21d251>30. So s=21.\n\n4. (5,6): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod6.\n\ns\u22611 mod6 \u21d2 s=6m +1. Must be \u22610 mod5 \u21d26m +1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d26m \u2261-1 mod5 \u21d26m\u22614 mod5 \u21d2m\u22614*(6^{-1} mod5). Since 6\u22611 mod5, inverse is 1. So m\u22614 mod5. \n\nm=4 \u21d2 s=25, m=9 \u21d255>30. So s=25.\n\n5. (6,5): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 s=5m +1. Must be \u22610 mod6 \u21d25m +1 \u22610 mod6 \u21d25m \u2261-1 mod6 \u21d25m\u22615 mod6 \u21d2m\u22611 mod6. \n\nm=1 \u21d2s=6, m=7 \u21d236>30. So s=6.\n\n6. (10,3): s\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns\u22611 mod3 \u21d2s=3m +1. Must be \u22610 mod10 \u21d23m +1 \u22610 mod10 \u21d23m\u2261-1 mod10 \u21d23m\u22619 mod10 \u21d2m\u22613 mod10. \n\nm=3 \u21d2 s=10, m=13 \u21d240>30. So s=10.\n\nWait, 3m +1=10? Let me check m=3: 3*3+1=10, yes. So s=10.\n\n7. (15,2): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod2.\n\ns\u22611 mod2 \u21d2s is odd. Also s\u22610 mod15 \u21d2s=15,45,\u2026 Within 1-30: s=15, 45 is over.\n\nCheck s=15: 15 is odd? No, 15 is odd. Wait 15 is odd? 15 is odd. Yes. So s=15.\n\nWait, s=15: 15 mod2=1, yes. So s=15 is solution.\n\n8. (30,1): s\u22610 mod30 and s\u22611 mod1 \u21d2any s\u22610 mod30. So s=30.\n\nThus the solutions in [1,30] are s=1,6,10,15,16,21,25,30. \n\nSo total 8 solutions. \n\nNow, the solutions above ceil(sqrt(31))=6. So starting from 6 to 30. \n\nThe solutions in this interval are s=6,10,15,16,21,25,30. That is 7 solutions. \n\nWait, s=6 is included (since ceil(sqrt(31))=6, so starting at 6). \n\nSo 7 solutions. Not exceeding 10. \n\nTherefore, N=30 gives 7 solutions. \n\nHmm. Let's try N=60 (which has factors 2^2*3*5, so \u03c9(N)=3, so total solutions 8). Wait, same as before. \n\nAlternatively, let's try N=210 (which has \u03c9=4 (2,3,5,7)), so 16 total solutions. Let's see:\n\nN=210, so b=211.\n\nCompute ceil(sqrt(211))\u224814.525, so ceil is 15.\n\nWe need to count solutions from 15 to 210. \n\nTotal solutions in [1,210] is 16. The solutions below 15 would be those s from 1 to14. Let me see how many there are. \n\nBut this might take time. Alternatively, maybe N= 2*3*5*7=210, but maybe there are smaller N with \u03c9=4?\n\nWait the minimal N with four distinct primes is 210, yes. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps a number like N= 2^3*3*5=120, which has \u03c9=3, so 8 solutions. \n\nAlternatively, let me check N= 2^3*3^2*5= 360, which also \u03c9=3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of going to four primes, maybe numbers with exponents but still more solutions. \n\nWait, perhaps another approach: The total solutions are 2^{\u03c9(N)}, so to get more than ten, need 2^{\u03c9(N)}>10, so \u03c9(N)>=4. Hence the minimal N is 210. \n\nBut let's check for N=210:\n\nTotal solutions 16. The number of solutions above ceil(sqrt(211))=15 is 16 minus solutions below 15. \n\nCompute solutions below 15:\n\nThe solutions in [1,14]. Let me list all solutions for N=210.\n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k) with d*k=210 and gcd(d,k)=1. Since N=2*3*5*7, the prime factors are 2,3,5,7. So the coprime pairs are all subsets of the prime factors assigned to d and the rest to k. \n\nThe number of such pairs is 2^4=16. Each corresponds to a unique s. Let me try to find all solutions s in [1,210].\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's tedious, but let's try some of them:\n\nTake the pair (d,k)=(1,210). Solution s\u22610 mod1 and s\u22611 mod210 \u21d2 s=1 mod210 \u21d2 s=1.\n\nPair (2,105): s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod105. Solve s=105m +1 even. 105m must be odd, so m must be odd. m=1 \u21d2 s=106, m=3 \u21d2316>210. So s=106.\n\nPair (3,70): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod70. Let s=70m +1. Must be divisible by 3 \u21d270m +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d270\u22611 mod3 \u21d21*m +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d2m\u22612 mod3. m=2 \u21d2141, m=5 \u21d2351>210. So s=141.\n\nPair (5,42): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod42. s=42m +1 must be divisible by 5 \u21d242m +1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d242\u22612 mod5 \u21d22m +1 \u22610 \u21d22m\u2261-1\u22614 \u21d2m\u22612 mod5. m=2 \u21d285, m=7 \u21d2295>210. So s=85.\n\nPair (7,30): s\u22610 mod7 and s\u22611 mod30. s=30m +1. Must be divisible by7 \u21d230m +1 \u22610 mod7 \u21d230\u22612 mod7 \u21d22m +1\u22610 \u21d22m\u22616 \u21d2m\u22613 mod7. m=3 \u21d291, m=10 \u21d2301>210. So s=91.\n\nPair (6,35): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod35. s=35m +1 must be divisible by6. 35\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d2-m +1 \u22610 mod6 \u21d2-m\u2261-1 \u21d2m\u22611 mod6. m=1 \u21d236, m=7 \u21d2250>210. So s=36.\n\nWait, 35*1 +1=36, yes.\n\nPair (10,21): s\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod21. s=21m +1 divisible by10 \u21d221m +1\u22610 mod10 \u21d221\u22611 mod10 \u21d2m +1\u22610 mod10 \u21d2m\u22619 mod10. m=9 \u21d2190, m=19 \u21d2400>210. So s=190.\n\nPair (14,15): s\u22610 mod14 and s\u22611 mod15. s=15m +1 divisible by14 \u21d215m +1\u22610 mod14 \u21d215\u22611 mod14 \u21d2m +1\u22610 \u21d2m\u226113 mod14. m=13 \u21d2196, which is 15*13 +1=196. 196 mod14=0, yes. So s=196.\n\nSimilarly, other pairs like (15,14), (21,10), (30,7), (35,6), (42,5), (70,3), (105,2), (210,1). \n\nContinuing:\n\nPair (15,14): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod14. s=14m +1 divisible by15 \u21d214m +1\u22610 mod15 \u21d214m\u2261-1 mod15 \u21d214m\u226114 mod15 \u21d2m\u22611 mod15. m=1 \u21d215, m=16 \u21d2225>210. So s=15.\n\nWait, 14*1 +1=15. Yes, 15 mod14=1, so that works.\n\nPair (21,10): s\u22610 mod21 and s\u22611 mod10. s=10m +1 divisible by21 \u21d210m +1\u22610 mod21 \u21d210m\u2261-1 mod21 \u21d210m\u226120 mod21 \u21d2m\u22612 mod21 (since 10*2=20). m=2 \u21d221, m=23 \u21d2231>210. So s=21.\n\nPair (30,7): s\u22610 mod30 and s\u22611 mod7. s=7m +1 divisible by30 \u21d27m +1\u22610 mod30 \u21d27m\u2261-1 mod30 \u21d27m\u226129 mod30. 7 and 30 coprime. inverse of 7 mod30 is 13 since 7*13=91\u22611 mod30. So m\u226129*13 mod30. 29*13=377 mod30= 377-12*30=377-360=17 \u21d2 m\u226117 mod30. m=17 \u21d27*17+1=120, m=47 \u21d2330>210. So s=120.\n\nPair (35,6): s\u22610 mod35 and s\u22611 mod6. s=6m +1 divisible by35 \u21d26m +1\u22610 mod35 \u21d26m\u2261-1 mod35 \u21d26m\u226134 mod35 \u21d2m\u226134*(6^{-1} mod35). Find inverse of 6 mod35. 6*6=36\u22611 \u21d2 inverse is6. So m\u226134*6=204 mod35. 204 mod35: 35*5=175, 204-175=29 \u21d2m\u226129 mod35. m=29 \u21d26*29 +1=175. m=64 \u21d2385>210. So s=175.\n\nPair (42,5): s\u22610 mod42 and s\u22611 mod5. s=5m +1 divisible by42 \u21d25m +1\u22610 mod42 \u21d25m\u2261-1 mod42 \u21d25m\u226141 mod42. Inverse of 5 mod42 is 17 (5*17=85\u22611 mod42). So m\u226141*17 mod42. 41\u2261-1 mod42, so (-1)*17= -17 mod42 \u21d225 mod42. m=25 \u21d25*25+1=126. m=67 \u21d2336>210. So s=126.\n\nPair (70,3): s\u22610 mod70 and s\u22611 mod3. s=3m +1 divisible by70 \u21d23m +1\u22610 mod70 \u21d23m\u2261-1 mod70 \u21d23m\u226169 mod70 \u21d2m\u226123 mod70 (since 3*23=69). m=23 \u21d23*23+1=70. m=93 \u21d2280>210. So s=70.\n\nPair (105,2): s\u22610 mod105 and s\u22611 mod2. s must be even and divisible by105 \u21d2s=105*2=210, but 210 mod2=0, which is even. Wait, s=105*1=105, but 105 mod2=1. Wait, need s\u22611 mod2 \u21d2 odd. But 105 is odd. So s=105 is a solution. \n\nWait, solving s\u22610 mod105 and s\u22611 mod2 \u21d2 s=105 is odd? 105 is odd. So yes, s=105.\n\nPair (210,1): s\u22610 mod210 \u21d2 s=210.\n\nOkay, compiling all solutions in [1,210]:\n\n1,15,21,30,36,60,70,85,91,105,106,120,126,141,175,190,196,210.\n\nWait, let me list all the solutions I found:\n\nFrom the pairs:\n\n1. (1,210): 1\n\n2. (2,105):106\n\n3. (3,70):141\n\n4. (5,42):85\n\n5. (7,30):91\n\n6. (6,35):36\n\n7. (10,21):190\n\n8. (14,15):196\n\n9. (15,14):15\n\n10. (21,10):21\n\n11. (30,7):120\n\n12. (35,6):175\n\n13. (42,5):126\n\n14. (70,3):70\n\n15. (105,2):105\n\n16. (210,1):210\n\nWait, that's 16 solutions. So the solutions in [1,210] are: 1,15,21,36,70,85,91,105,106,120,126,141,175,190,196,210. \n\nNow, the lower bound is ceil(sqrt(211))=15. So solutions from 15 to210. \n\nSo excluding s=1 (which is below 15), the rest 15 solutions are from 15 to210. So the count is 15, which is more than ten. \n\nTherefore, N=210 gives 15 solutions above the threshold. So b=N+1=211 would be a candidate. \n\nBut the question is to find the least such b. Maybe there's a smaller N with \u03c9(N)=4 but with smaller N? \n\nWait, the minimal N with four distinct prime factors is 2*3*5*7=210, so that is the smallest. Therefore, N=210 is the minimal N where \u03c9(N)=4. So b=211 would be the minimal base where the count exceeds 10. \n\nWait, but maybe there is a smaller N with \u03c9(N)=3 but with more solutions above the threshold? \n\nLet me check for N=60 (\u03c9=3, primes 2,3,5). \n\nN=60, so b=61.\n\nCompute ceil(sqrt(61))\u22487.81, so ceil=8.\n\nTotal solutions in [1,60] are 8. Let me list them.\n\nThe coprime pairs (d,k) for N=60 (factors 2,3,5):\n\nThe coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,60), (2,30), (3,20), (4,15), (5,12), (6,10), (10,6), (12,5), (15,4), (20,3), (30,2), (60,1). Wait, but need to ensure that d and k are coprime. \n\nWait, N=60=2^2*3*5. The coprime pairs (d,k) must be such that gcd(d,k)=1. \n\nPossible coprime pairs:\n\nThe prime factors are 2,3,5. \n\nPossible assignments:\n\nEach prime can go to d or k, but not both. So:\n\nThe possible coprime pairs are formed by partitioning the prime factors between d and k. \n\nEach prime (2,3,5) can be in d or k. So 2^3=8 possibilities. \n\nLet me list them:\n\n1. d=1 (no primes), k=60 (all primes). \n\nSolution s\u22611 mod60.\n\n2. d=2 (prime 2), k=3*5=15. \n\nSolution s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\n3. d=3 (prime3), k=2^2*5=20. \n\nSolution s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod20.\n\n4. d=5 (prime5), k=2^2*3=12.\n\nSolution s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod12.\n\n5. d=2*3=6 (primes 2,3), k=5.\n\nSolution s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\n6. d=2*5=10 (primes2,5), k=3.\n\nSolution s\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\n7. d=3*5=15 (primes3,5), k=4 (2^2).\n\nSolution s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\n8. d=2*3*5=30, k=2 (but wait, 2 is already in d). Wait no, d=30 would include all primes, so k=2^2/2? Hmm, perhaps I need to re-express.\n\nWait, maybe I should think of each coprime pair as choosing a subset of the primes for d, and the complement for k. \n\nThus, for each subset S of the prime factors {2,3,5}, assign d= product of primes in S, and k= product of primes not in S. Then, d and k are coprime, and d*k = N only if the exponents are considered. Wait, but N=60=2^2*3*5. \n\nWait, actually, the coprime pairs (d,k) must multiply to N, and be coprime. \n\nTherefore, the exponents in d and k must be such that for each prime, its exponent is entirely in d or in k. \n\nTherefore, for each prime, we decide whether it goes to d or to k. \n\nFor example, for prime 2 (with exponent 2), we can assign all its exponent to d or to k. Similarly for primes 3 and 5 (each exponent 1). \n\nTherefore, the coprime pairs (d,k) are determined by the choice for each prime (including their exponents) to be in d or k. \n\nThus, for prime 2: assign to d or k (but since exponent is 2, if assigned to d, d gets 2^2, if to k, then k gets 2^2).\n\nSimilarly for primes 3 and 5: assign to d or k. \n\nThus the number of coprime pairs is 2^3=8 (since three primes), as before. \n\nLet me compute the solutions:\n\n1. (1,60): s\u22611 mod60 \u21d2 s=1.\n\n2. (2,30): s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod30. \n\nSolve s=30m+1 even. 30m must be odd \u21d2 m odd. m=1 \u21d2 s=31, m=3 \u21d291>60. So s=31.\n\n3. (3,20): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod20. \n\ns=20m +1 divisible by3 \u21d220m +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 \u21d22m +1\u22610 \u21d22m\u22612 \u21d2m\u22611 mod3. \n\nm=1 \u21d221, m=4 \u21d281>60. So s=21.\n\n4. (5,12): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod12. \n\ns=12m +1 divisible by5 \u21d212m +1\u22610 mod5 \u21d212\u22612 \u21d22m +1\u22610 \u21d22m\u22614 \u21d2m\u22612 mod5. \n\nm=2 \u21d225, m=7 \u21d285>60. So s=25.\n\n5. (6,10): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod10. \n\ns=10m +1 divisible by6 \u21d210m +1\u22610 mod6 \u21d210\u22614 \u21d24m +1\u22610 \u21d24m\u22615 \u21d24m\u22615 mod6 \u21d22m\u22612.5 \u21d2 Wait, 4m \u22615 mod6 \u21d24m \u22615 mod6. Since 4 and6 are not coprime, check if 5 divisible by gcd(4,6)=2? 5 mod2=1, so no solution. \n\nWait, contradiction. Hmm, so no solution? That can't be.\n\nWait, maybe made a mistake here. Let me solve s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod10.\n\nLet me write s=6k. Then 6k \u22611 mod10 \u21d26k \u22611 mod10 \u21d26k mod10=1 \u21d2k must satisfy 6k mod10=1. \n\n6 and10 have gcd 2. So 6k \u22611 mod10 \u21d2 equation has solution only if gcd(6,10) divides 1 \u21d22 divides1 \u21d2 no solution. So this pair (6,10) does not yield a solution. \n\nHmm, so this pair actually has no solution? But according to earlier reasoning, each coprime pair should give a solution. \n\nWait, but (6,10): gcd(6,10)=2\u22601. So perhaps my mistake earlier was in considering (d,k) with gcd(d,k)=1, but here d=6 and k=10 have gcd 2. \n\nWait, that's a problem! \n\nWait, the coprime pairs must have gcd(d,k)=1. So in this case, d=6 and k=10 have gcd 2, so they are not coprime. So this pair is invalid. \n\nAh! So my mistake earlier was not ensuring that d and k are coprime. \n\nTherefore, the coprime pairs must satisfy gcd(d,k)=1. \n\nTherefore, when forming the pairs, after choosing which primes go to d and which to k, we must have that the exponents are such that the primes are separated. \n\nWait, in the case of N=60=2^2*3*5, when we choose to assign prime2 to d and primes3,5 to k, then d=2^2=4 and k=3*5=15 \u21d2 gcd(4,15)=1. \n\nBut in the case where we assign primes2 and3 to d, and prime5 to k, then d=2^2*3=12 and k=5 \u21d2 gcd(12,5)=1. \n\nHowever, if we assign primes2 and3 to d, and prime5 to k, then d=2^2*3=12, k=5 \u21d2 gcd(12,5)=1. \n\nWait, but in the case where we assigned primes2 and3 to d, then k would be 5, which is okay. \n\nWait, the problem was with the pair (6,10). Let's see: \n\nIf d=6 (which includes primes2 and3), then k would have to be N/d=60/6=10. But 10 includes prime2 and5. Since prime2 is already in d, so d and k share prime2 \u21d2 gcd(d,k)=2\u22601. \n\nTherefore, that pair is invalid. \n\nThus, when forming the coprime pairs (d,k), we must ensure that d and k are coprime. \n\nTherefore, the correct coprime pairs for N=60 are only those where the chosen subsets of primes for d and k are such that they don't share any primes. \n\nTherefore, for each prime, you choose to put it entirely in d or in k. \n\nThus, for each prime, you have two choices, so 2^3=8 pairs, but some of them may have d or k as 1. \n\nWait, but when you choose a subset of primes for d, then k is the product of the remaining primes. Since each prime is either in d or k, they are coprime. \n\nThus, the correct coprime pairs are indeed 8, but in the case of N=60, some of the pairs may have d or k with exponents. \n\nWait, let me recompute the coprime pairs properly. \n\nThe prime factors are 2,3,5. \n\nEach prime must be assigned entirely to d or k. \n\nSo:\n\n1. Assign none to d: d=1, k=2^2*3*5=60 \u21d2 (1,60)\n\n2. Assign 2 to d: d=2^2=4, k=3*5=15 \u21d2 (4,15)\n\n3. Assign3 to d: d=3, k=2^2*5=20 \u21d2 (3,20)\n\n4. Assign5 to d: d=5, k=2^2*3=12 \u21d2 (5,12)\n\n5. Assign 2 and3 to d: d=2^2*3=12, k=5 \u21d2 (12,5)\n\n6. Assign2 and5 to d: d=2^2*5=20, k=3 \u21d2 (20,3)\n\n7. Assign3 and5 to d: d=3*5=15, k=2^2=4 \u21d2 (15,4)\n\n8. Assign all primes to d: d=2^2*3*5=60, k=1 \u21d2 (60,1)\n\nSo these are the 8 coprime pairs. \n\nNow, the invalid pair I considered earlier (6,10) is not actually a valid coprime pair because it would require assigning some primes to both d and k. \n\nTherefore, now, let's compute solutions for these valid pairs:\n\n1. (1,60): s=1 mod60 \u21d2 s=1.\n\n2.

So m\u226111*5=55 mod12 \u21d255 mod12=7 \u21d2m\u22617 mod12.\n\nm=7 \u21d25*7+1=36, m=19 \u21d296>60 \u21d2 s=36.\n\n6.

So m\u226119*7=133 mod20 \u21d2133 mod20=13 \u21d2m\u226113 mod20.\n\nm=13 \u21d23*13+1=40, m=33 \u21d2100>60 \u21d2s=40.\n\n7.

(60,1): s\u22610 mod60 \u21d2 s=60.\n\nSo the solutions are s=1,16,21,25,36,40,45,60. \n\nTotal of 8 solutions in [1,60]. \n\nNow, the count above ceil(sqrt(61))=8. So from s=8 to60. \n\nThe solutions in this interval are: 16,21,25,36,40,45,60. That's 7 solutions.

That would have \u03c9=4 (primes 2,3,5,7). So total solutions 16. \n\nBut N=420 is bigger than 210, so 210 is still better. \n\nAlternatively, maybe a number like N= 2*3*5*11= 330. That's higher than 210, so not better. \n\nThus, the minimal N is 210. \n\nWait, but perhaps there's a smaller N with \u03c9=4 but not minimal prime factors? \n\nWait, the minimal is 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210. \n\nHence, the answer should be 211. \n\nHowever, let me check N= 120 (\u03c9=3) but with some other consideration? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the N=210 count. Let me recheck:\n\nFor N=210, the solutions above ceil(sqrt(211))=15 are all except s=1. \n\nThe solutions are:\n\n1,15,21,36,70,85,91,105,106,120,126,141,175,190,196,210. \n\nExcluding s=1, that's 15 solutions. \n\nYes, so 15 >10. \n\nTherefore, the minimal b is 211. \n\nWait, but the problem states \"the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers\". \n\nTherefore, the answer is 211. \n\nHowever, the problem might have a smaller answer. Let me think again. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed some cases where N has a higher number of solutions without having four prime factors. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering that when N has exponents, even with \u03c9=3, the number of solutions can be higher? \n\nWait, let me try N= 60 (\u03c9=3). \n\nWait, in N=60, total solutions are 8, so above sqrt(N+1)=~8, giving 7 solutions. \n\nWait, but maybe there is a number with \u03c9=3 where the number of solutions above the threshold is higher. \n\nWait, let me try N= 105 (\u03c9=3). \n\nTotal solutions 8. Above ceil(sqrt(106))=11, there are 7 solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, N= 2*3*5*7=210 is indeed the first with \u03c9=4. \n\nThus, the minimal b is 211. \n\nWait, but let me check another case where N= 30 (\u03c9=3). \n\nWait, but for N=30, we had 7 solutions above the threshold. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me check N= 240 (which is 2^4*3*5, \u03c9=3).

The problem says \"the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\" So the minimal b where the count exceeds ten. \n\nWait, perhaps there is a number with \u03c9=4 but smaller than 210? \n\nWait, the product of the first four primes is 2*3*5*7=210. \n\nThere are no smaller numbers with four distinct prime factors. \n\nTherefore, yes, the minimal N is 210, so the minimal b is 211. \n\nHence, I think the final answer is 211.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{211}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the least integer \\( b \\geq 2 \\) for which there are more than ten \\( b \\)-eautiful integers. A \\( b \\)-eautiful number \\( n \\) has exactly two digits in base \\( b \\), and the sum of these digits equals \\( \\sqrt{n} \\).\n\nKey steps:\n1. **Understanding \\( b \\)-eautiful numbers**: A number \\( n \\) is \\( b \\)-eautiful if it can be written as \\( n = ab + c \\) (where \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are digits in base \\( b \\)) and \\( a + c = \\sqrt{n} \\).\n2. **Equation derivation**: The equation \\( a + c = \\sqrt{n} \\) leads to \\( (a + c)^2 = ab + c \\). Rearranging gives \\( a(b - 1) = a^2 + ac + c^2 - c \\).\n3. **Solutions analysis**: For each \\( b \\), we need to count the number of valid \\( s = \\sqrt{n} \\) such that \\( s(s - 1) \\) is divisible by \\( b - 1 \\). This is equivalent to \\( s \\) and \\( s - 1 \\) being coprime and their product divisible by \\( b - 1 \\).\n4. **Prime factor consideration**: The number of solutions is \\( 2^{\\omega(N)} \\) where \\( N = b - 1 \\) and \\( \\omega(N) \\) is the number of distinct prime factors of \\( N \\). To exceed 10 solutions, \\( 2^{\\omega(N)} \\) must be greater than 10, requiring \\( \\omega(N) \\geq 4 \\).\n5. **Minimal \\( N \\) with four distinct primes**: The smallest \\( N \\) with four distinct prime factors is \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 = 210 \\). Thus, \\( b = N + 1 = 211 \\).\n\nVerification:\n- For \\( N = 210 \\), the number of solutions in the required interval exceeds 10, confirming \\( b = 211 \\) as the minimal base.\n\nFinal Answer:\n\\boxed{211}",
