      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n\u2074 + 1 is divisible by p\u00b2. Then, once I find that prime p, I have to determine the smallest positive integer m such that m\u2074 + 1 is divisible by p\u00b2. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, the problem is about primes squared dividing n\u2074 +1. So, I need to find the smallest prime p where p\u00b2 divides some n\u2074 +1. Then, once that p is found, find the smallest m where the same condition holds. \n\nHmm, primes dividing n\u2074 +1. I know that n\u2074 +1 can sometimes be factored, but over integers, it doesn't factor into polynomials with integer coefficients. Wait, actually, n\u2074 +1 is irreducible over integers, right? So maybe factoring isn't the way to go here. Maybe I need to think about modular arithmetic?\n\nSince p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1, that means n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2. So, we need to find primes p where the congruence x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2 has a solution. And we need the smallest such prime p. Then the minimal m is the smallest solution to that congruence for that p.\n\nI remember that for primes, the congruence x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p has solutions only if certain conditions on p are met. Specifically, I think that -1 must be a fourth power modulo p. Let me recall the conditions for that. \n\nFirst, for the equation x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p to have a solution, the order of -1 modulo p must divide 8, but since -1 has order 2 modulo p (unless p=2, which we can check separately). Wait, actually, the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p implies that (-1) must be in the subgroup generated by x\u2074. The order of -1 in the multiplicative group is 2, so for this to be a fourth power, 2 must divide the order of the group divided by 4? Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the multiplicative order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more straightforwardly: The equation x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p implies that x^8 \u2261 1 mod p, so the order of x modulo p divides 8. But also, the order must not divide 4, otherwise x^4 \u22611 mod p, which would contradict x^4 \u2261-1. Therefore, the order of x must be exactly 8. Therefore, 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group mod p, which is p-1. So, 8 divides p-1, so p \u22611 mod 8.\n\nTherefore, primes p where p \u22611 mod 8 can have solutions to x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p. So primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are candidates. But the question is about p\u00b2 dividing n\u2074 +1, which is a stronger condition.\n\nSo, first, the primes p must satisfy p \u22611 mod 8, because otherwise even mod p there's no solution. But even if there is a solution mod p, we need to see if there is a solution mod p\u00b2.\n\nHmm, so the problem is now to find the smallest prime p \u22611 mod 8 such that the congruence x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2 has a solution, then find the minimal m for that p.\n\nI know that sometimes solutions modulo p can lift to solutions modulo p\u00b2 via Hensel's lemma, but Hensel's lemma requires that the derivative of the polynomial at the root is not divisible by p. Let me recall Hensel's lemma properly.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u2074 +1. Suppose we have a solution x \u2261 a mod p such that f(a) \u22610 mod p and f\u2019(a) \u22614a\u00b3 mod p is not \u22610 mod p. Then, there is a unique lift of a modulo p\u00b2. However, if f\u2019(a) \u22610 mod p, then we need to check whether f(a) \u22610 mod p\u00b2 already, in which case there might be multiple solutions or none.\n\nWait, so in our case, f\u2019(x)=4x\u00b3. So, if a is a solution mod p, so a\u2074 \u2261-1 mod p, then f\u2019(a)=4a\u00b3 mod p. For Hensel's lemma to apply, we need 4a\u00b3 not \u22610 mod p. Since p is an odd prime (since p=2 would have 2\u00b2=4, but n\u2074 +1 mod 4: n even, n\u2074 is 0 mod 4, so 0+1=1 mod4, not 0. n odd, n\u2074 is 1 mod4, so 1+1=2 mod4, which also isn't 0 mod4. So p=2 is out. So p is odd. Thus, 4a\u00b3 mod p is 0 only if a\u22610 mod p, but if a\u22610 mod p, then a\u2074 \u22610 mod p, but we need a\u2074 \u2261-1 mod p, which would require -1\u22610 mod p, so p divides 1, which is impossible. Therefore, f\u2019(a) is never 0 mod p for any solution a. Therefore, Hensel's lemma tells us that any solution mod p can be lifted uniquely to mod p\u00b2. Therefore, if there is a solution mod p, then there is a solution mod p\u00b2. Wait, so does that mean that for primes p\u22611 mod8, there is always a solution mod p\u00b2? But the problem says \"the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n\u2074+1 is divisible by p\u00b2\". If all primes p\u22611 mod8 satisfy this, then the least such prime is the smallest prime \u22611 mod8, which is 17?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check. The primes congruent to 1 mod8 are 17, 41, 73, 89, etc. The first one is 17. So if the minimal p is 17, then m would be the minimal m such that m\u2074 \u2261-1 mod 17\u00b2. But maybe that's not the case. Wait, perhaps there's a prime p\u22611 mod8 where the solution mod p doesn't lift to mod p\u00b2? But according to Hensel's lemma, it should. Wait, Hensel's lemma says that if f(a) \u22610 mod p and f\u2019(a) not \u22610 mod p, then there exists a unique lift mod p\u00b2. Therefore, the existence of a solution mod p implies existence mod p\u00b2. So if p\u22611 mod8, then there is a solution mod p, which can be lifted to mod p\u00b2, so then n\u2074 +1 divisible by p\u00b2 is possible for such primes. Therefore, the minimal p should be the minimal prime \u22611 mod8, which is 17. Hmm, but maybe that's not the case?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me test with p=17. Let me see if there exists an n such that n\u2074 +1 is divisible by 17\u00b2=289.\n\nFirst, let me find a solution mod17. Since 17\u22611 mod8, so there exists solutions to x\u2074\u2261-1 mod17. Let me find such an x. Let me try numbers from 1 to 16.\n\nLet me compute 3\u2074 mod17: 3^4=81 mod17. 17*4=68, so 81-68=13. 13 mod17 is 13. Not -1.\n\nHow about 4: 4^4=256 mod17. 17*15=255, so 256 mod17 is 1. Not -1.\n\n5^4=625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13. Again 13.\n\nHmm, 6^4=1296 mod17. Let's divide 1296 by17: 17*76=1292, so 1296 mod17 is 4.\n\n7^4=2401 mod17. 17*141=2397, so 2401 mod17 is 4.\n\n8^4=4096 mod17. 17*241=4097, so mod17 is -1? Wait, 4096 mod17 is 4096-17*241=4096-4097=-1 mod17. So 8^4 \u2261-1 mod17. Oh! So 8 is a solution mod17. Great. So then, by Hensel's lemma, there should be a solution mod17\u00b2.\n\nLet me try to find it. Let me set n =8 +17k, and plug into n^4 +1 \u22610 mod17\u00b2. Let me compute (8+17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nFirst, expand (8 +17k)^4. Let's compute this modulo 17\u00b2. Since 17k is a multiple of 17, so terms beyond the second in the binomial expansion will have higher powers of 17 and hence vanish mod17\u00b2. So:\n\n(8 +17k)^4 = 8^4 + 4*(8)^3*(17k) + 6*(8)^2*(17k)^2 + ... higher terms.\n\nBut modulo 17\u00b2, the terms with (17k)^2 and higher are 17\u00b2*(something), so mod17\u00b2 they are 0. So:\n\n\u22618^4 +4*8\u00b3*17k mod17\u00b2.\n\nWe know that 8^4 \u2261-1 mod17, so mod17\u00b2, 8^4 = -1 +17*m for some integer m. Let me compute 8^4 exactly. 8^2=64, so 8^4=64\u00b2=4096. 4096 divided by17\u00b2=289. 289*14=4046, so 4096-4046=50. So 8^4=4096\u226150 mod289. Since 50 mod17 is 50-2*17=16, which is -1 mod17, so that checks out. So 8^4=50 mod289.\n\nTherefore, (8+17k)^4 +1 \u226150 +4*(8)^3*(17k) +1 mod289.\n\nWait, actually, hold on. Let me recast that. The expansion was (8 +17k)^4 \u22618^4 +4*(8)^3*(17k) mod17\u00b2. Then adding 1 gives:\n\n\u2261 (8^4 +1) +4*(8)^3*(17k) mod17\u00b2.\n\nBut 8^4 +1 mod289 is 50 +1 =51 mod289. So total expression is 51 +4*512*(17k) mod289.\n\nWait, compute 4*(8)^3. 8^3=512, so 4*512=2048. Then 2048*17k mod289.\n\nBut 2048 mod289? Let's compute 289*7=2023, so 2048-2023=25. So 2048 \u226125 mod289. Therefore, 2048*17k mod289 is 25*17k mod289. 25*17=425. 425 mod289 is 425 -289=136. So 425\u2261136 mod289. So total:\n\nThe expression becomes 51 +136k mod289. We need this to be congruent to 0 mod289. So,\n\n51 +136k \u22610 mod289\n\nSolving for k:\n\n136k \u2261-51 mod289\n\nLet me compute 136 and 289. Since 289 is 17\u00b2, and 136 is 17*8. So 136 =17*8, 289=17\u00b2. Let's divide both sides by 17:\n\n17*8 *k \u2261-17*3 mod17\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by17:\n\n8k \u2261-3 mod17\n\nSo 8k \u226114 mod17 (since -3 mod17 is14).\n\nNow, solve 8k \u226114 mod17.\n\nFind the inverse of8 mod17. 8* x \u22611 mod17. Let's see, 8*2=16\u2261-1 mod17, so 8*(-2)=1 mod17. So inverse of 8 is -2 mod17, which is 15.\n\nSo multiply both sides by15:\n\nk\u226114*15 mod17.\n\n14*15=210. 210 mod17: 17*12=204, so 210-204=6. So k\u22616 mod17.\n\nTherefore, k=6 +17t for some integer t. Since we want the minimal positive n, we can take k=6. Therefore, n=8+17*6=8+102=110. So n=110 is a solution mod289. Let me check that 110\u2074 +1 mod289 is 0?\n\nAlternatively, compute (8 +17*6)^4 +1 mod289. Wait, but we already did the expansion and found that when k=6, the expression is 51 +136*6 mod289. 136*6=816. 816 mod289: 289*2=578, 816-578=238. 238 mod289 is 238. So 51 +238=289\u22610 mod289. Perfect. So n=110 is a solution mod289. So 110\u2074 +1 is divisible by17\u00b2=289. Therefore, 17 is a prime where such an n exists. \n\nBut is there a smaller prime? The next prime less than 17 which is 1 mod8? Let's see, primes congruent to 1 mod8 start at 17, since 1 mod8 primes are 17, 41, 73, etc. The primes less than 17: Let's check primes like 7, which is 7 mod8, 3 mod8, 5 mod8, etc. The next prime after 2,3,5,7,11,13. 17 is the first prime \u22611 mod8. So 17 is the minimal such prime. Wait, but let me confirm if for p=17, there is indeed a solution mod p\u00b2. Which we just saw, n=110. So then the minimal m would be 110? Wait, but maybe there is a smaller m? Since 8 mod17 is the solution mod17, but when lifting to mod289, the minimal solution might be smaller than 110. Wait, in our calculation above, we set n=8 +17k, and found k=6 gives n=110. But maybe there is a smaller k?\n\nWait, let me see. When we solved for k in 8k \u226114 mod17, we found k\u22616 mod17, so the minimal positive k is 6. Therefore, the minimal n would be 8+17*6=110. Alternatively, could there be a smaller n not of the form 8 +17k? Wait, but Hensel's lemma says the solution is unique modulo p\u00b2, so the solution mod p\u00b2 is unique in the congruence class mod p. So the minimal solution would be 8 +17*6=110? Wait, but perhaps the minimal positive solution is actually 17\u00b2 - (something)? Hmm, maybe not. Let me check if 110 is indeed the minimal m such that m\u2074 \u2261-1 mod289. Alternatively, maybe there is a smaller m?\n\nLet me try m=8 mod17, but smaller than 110. Let me try m=8. 8^4=4096 mod289. As before, 4096 mod289: 289*14=4046, 4096-4046=50. So 50 mod289, which is not 0 mod289. So that doesn't work. Next, m=8+17=25. Let's compute 25^4 +1 mod289. 25^2=625, 25^4=(625)^2. 625 mod289: 289*2=578, so 625-578=47. So 25^2 \u226147 mod289. Then 47^2 mod289. 47\u00b2=2209. 289*7=2023. 2209-2023=186. So 25^4 \u2261186 mod289. 186+1=187 mod289\u22600. Not zero.\n\nNext, m=8+34=42. Let me compute 42^4 mod289. 42 mod289 is 42. 42\u00b2=1764. 1764 mod289: 289*6=1734. 1764-1734=30. So 42\u00b2\u226130 mod289. Then 30\u00b2=900 mod289. 289*3=867, so 900-867=33. So 42^4\u226133 mod289. 33+1=34\u22600 mod289.\n\nNext, m=8+51=59. 59 mod289 is 59. 59\u00b2=3481 mod289. 289*12=3468. 3481-3468=13 mod289. So 59\u00b2\u226113. Then 13\u00b2=169 mod289. So 59^4\u2261169 mod289. 169+1=170\u22600.\n\nContinuing, m=8+68=76. 76 mod289 is76. 76\u00b2=5776. 289*20=5780, so 5776 mod289 is -4 mod289. So 76\u00b2\u2261-4. Then (-4)^2=16 mod289. 76^4\u226116 mod289. 16+1=17\u22600.\n\nm=8+85=93. Let me compute 93^4 mod289. 93 mod289 is93. 93\u00b2: 93\u00b2=8649. 289*29=8381. 8649-8381=268 mod289. So 93\u00b2\u2261268 mod289. 268\u00b2 mod289. 268 mod289 is same as -21. So (-21)^2=441 mod289. 441-289=152. So 268\u00b2\u2261152 mod289. 152+1=153\u22600.\n\nNext, m=8+102=110. We know this gives 0 mod289. So indeed, 110 is the first one in that sequence. So 110 is the minimal m for p=17. But is there a smaller m not in the 8+17k sequence?\n\nWait, perhaps another solution mod17? Since in mod17, the equation x\u2074\u2261-1 mod17 has solutions. We found x=8, but maybe there are others?\n\nLet me check. Let's see, since 8 is a solution, then so are 8*(-1)= -8=9 mod17? Wait, let me check 9^4 mod17. 9^2=81\u226113 mod17, so 9^4=13\u00b2=169\u226116\u2261-1 mod17. So 9 is also a solution. Similarly, 8*2=16 mod17? Wait, 16^4: 16\u2261-1 mod17, so (-1)^4=1 mod17, which is not -1. So no. Wait, perhaps the solutions mod17 are 8 and 9, and their negatives?\n\nWait, let's see: The multiplicative group mod17 is cyclic of order16. The solutions to x\u2074 \u2261-1 mod17 are elements of order 8, since x^8\u22611 mod17, but x^4\u2261-1\u22601. So there should be \u03c6(8)=4 solutions. Let me check.\n\nWe found 8 and 9. Let me check 15 mod17. 15 is -2 mod17. Let's compute 15^4 mod17. 15^2=225\u22614 mod17, so 15^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. So 15 is also a solution. Similarly, 16-15=2? Wait, 15^4 is 16 mod17? Wait, 15^2= ( -2)^2=4 mod17, so 15^4=4\u00b2=16 mod17, which is -1 mod17. Yes. So 15 is a solution. Similarly, let's check 6: 6^4 mod17. 6^2=36\u22612 mod17. 2^2=4 mod17. Not -1. 7^4: 7^2=49\u226115 mod17, then 15\u00b2=225\u22614 mod17. Not -1. Wait, maybe 13? 13 mod17. 13\u00b2=169\u226116 mod17. Then 13^4=(16)^2=256\u22611 mod17. Not -1. Hmm, so perhaps the solutions are 8, 9, 15, and another?\n\nWait, let me try 7: 7^4 was 4 mod17? Wait earlier I thought 7^4 was 4 mod17. Let me recheck:\n\n7^2 is 49 mod17. 49-2*17=15. So 7^2\u226115 mod17. Then 7^4=(15)^2=225 mod17. 225-13*17=225-221=4 mod17. So yes, 4 mod17. Not -1. \n\nWait, 14: 14 mod17 is -3. 14^2=9 mod17. 14^4=81 mod17\u226113 mod17. Not -1. \n\nHow about 5: 5\u00b2=25\u22618 mod17. 5^4=64\u226113 mod17. Not -1. \n\nWait, so maybe the solutions are 8,9,15, and another?\n\nWait, let's see, let's list all elements of order 8 in the multiplicative group mod17. The group is cyclic of order16, so elements of order 8 are the generators of the subgroup of order8. Since 16/8=2, so the number is \u03c6(8)=4. Let me see, starting with 3: 3 is a primitive root mod17? Let's see: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^4=81\u226113, 3^8\u226113\u00b2=169\u226116 mod17. 3^16\u22611 mod17. So 3 has order16. So elements of order8 would be 3^2, 3^6, 3^10, 3^14? Let me check. \n\n3^2=9 mod17. 9^8 mod17: since 9 has order8 (since 9^4= (3^2)^4=3^8\u226116\u2261-1 mod17, so 9^8\u22611 mod17. So yes, order8. Similarly, 3^6: 3^6 mod17. Let me compute 3^3=27\u226110 mod17. 3^6=10^2=100\u226115 mod17. 15 has order8? 15^2=225\u22614 mod17, 15^4\u226116 mod17, 15^8\u22611 mod17. So yes. 3^10=3^(8+2)=3^8*3\u00b2\u2261-1*9\u2261-9\u22618 mod17. So 8 is 3^10 mod17, which would have order8. Similarly 3^14=3^(16-2)=3^{-2}= (3^2)^{-1}=9^{-1} mod17. Since 9*2=18\u22611 mod17, so inverse of 9 is 2 mod17. Wait, but 3^14\u22612 mod17? Wait, perhaps my approach is getting convoluted. Anyway, the solutions mod17 are 8,9,15, and another. Wait, 15 is 3^6, 9 is 3^2, 8 is 3^10, then 3^14 would be another. Let's see 3^14 mod17. 3^14=3^(16-2)= (3^16)*(3^{-2})\u22611*(9^{-1}) mod17. Since 9*2=18\u22611 mod17, so 9^{-1}=2 mod17. Therefore, 3^14\u22612 mod17. Let's check 2^4 mod17. 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Oh! 2^4 is 16\u2261-1 mod17. So 2 is also a solution. Wait, so the solutions are 2,8,9,15 mod17. Let me confirm 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Yes. So 2 is a solution. So the four solutions mod17 are 2,8,9,15. \n\nTherefore, when lifting to mod289, each of these roots mod17 can be lifted to mod289. So perhaps the minimal m is the minimal among the lifts of these roots?\n\nEarlier, we considered lifting 8 mod17 to 110 mod289. Let's see what happens if we lift 2 mod17.\n\nLet me try the solution x=2 mod17. Let's set n=2 +17k. Then compute n^4 +1 mod289. Let's do the expansion again:\n\n(2 +17k)^4 =2^4 +4*2\u00b3*(17k) + ... higher terms. Mod289, the higher terms vanish.\n\nThus:\n\n\u226116 +4*(8)*(17k) mod289.\n\n4*8=32, so 32*17k=544k mod289.\n\n544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255; 255-289=-34 mod289. Wait, 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255; 255 mod289 is 255. Wait, 544 is 2*289 + 66? Wait 289*1=289, 289*2=578. 544-578= -34. So 544 mod289 is -34. Wait, maybe better to compute 544 divided by289:\n\n289*1=289, 544-289=255. 255 is still larger than289? No, 255 is less. Wait 255 is less than289. So 544 mod289 is255. Hmm, so 544k mod289 is255k mod289. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 4*2\u00b3*(17k)=4*8*17k= 544k. 544 divided by289 is 1 with remainder 255, so 544k mod289=255k mod289. Therefore:\n\n(2+17k)^4 +1 \u226116 +1 +255k mod289 \u226117 +255k mod289.\n\nSet this \u22610 mod289:\n\n255k \u2261 -17 mod289.\n\n255 and 289: GCD(255,289). 289-255=34. GCD(255,34). 255 mod34: 34*7=238, 255-238=17. GCD(34,17)=17. So GCD is17. Since 17 divides -17, so solution exists. Let's divide equation by17:\n\n255/17=15, 289/17=17, -17/17=-1.\n\nSo 15k \u2261 -1 mod17.\n\nThus, 15k \u226116 mod17. Solve for k.\n\n15 inverse mod17: 15*x\u22611 mod17. 15* 15=225\u22614 mod17, 15*13=195\u2261195-11*17=195-187=8 mod17. 15*7=105\u2261105-6*17=105-102=3 mod17. 15* 4=60\u226160-3*17=60-51=9 mod17. Hmm, maybe 15*(-1)= -15\u22612 mod17. 2*15=30\u226113 mod17. Not helpful. Alternatively, 15*x \u22611 mod17. Let me try x=8: 15*8=120. 120 mod17: 17*7=119, so 120\u22611 mod17. Oh! So inverse of15 mod17 is8. \n\nTherefore, k\u226116*8 mod17. 16*8=128 mod17. 17*7=119, so 128-119=9 mod17. So k\u22619 mod17. Therefore, k=9 +17t. The minimal positive k is9. Thus, n=2 +17*9=2+153=155. So n=155 is another solution mod289. Let me check 155^4 +1 mod289. But that's tedious. Alternatively, we can trust the calculation. But 155 is bigger than 110, so not better.\n\nNext, let's try lifting x=9 mod17. Let me set n=9 +17k. Compute (9+17k)^4 mod289.\n\nAgain, expanding:\n\n9^4 +4*9\u00b3*(17k) mod289. \n\nFirst compute 9^4 mod289. 9^2=81, so 9^4=81\u00b2=6561. 6561 divided by289: 289*22=6358. 6561-6358=203 mod289. So 9^4\u2261203 mod289. Then adding 1 gives 204 mod289. \n\nThen the second term: 4*(9)^3*(17k). 9^3=729. 729 mod289: 289*2=578, 729-578=151 mod289. So 4*151=604 mod289. 604-2*289=604-578=26 mod289. So 4*9\u00b3=26 mod289. Multiply by17k: 26*17k mod289. 26*17=442 mod289. 442-289=153 mod289. So 442\u2261153 mod289. Thus, total expression is:\n\n204 +153k mod289\u22610 mod289.\n\nSo 153k \u2261-204 mod289.\n\nLet me simplify. 153 and 289: GCD(153,289). 289-153=136. GCD(153,136). 153-136=17. GCD(136,17)=17. So GCD is17. Check if 17 divides -204: yes, since 204=12*17. So equation is solvable.\n\nDivide by17: 153/17=9, 289/17=17, -204/17=-12.\n\nThus 9k \u2261-12 mod17.\n\n9k \u22615 mod17 (since -12 mod17 is5).\n\nFind inverse of9 mod17. 9*2=18\u22611 mod17. So inverse is2. Thus:\n\nk\u22615*2=10 mod17. So k=10+17t. Minimal k is10. Then n=9+17*10=9+170=179. So n=179 is another solution. That's bigger than 110, so not better.\n\nNow, the last solution mod17 is15. Let's see: n=15 +17k.\n\nCompute (15 +17k)^4 mod289.\n\nFirst, 15^4 mod289. 15^2=225 mod289. 15^4=225\u00b2. 225 mod289 is225, so 225\u00b2=50625. Let me divide by289:\n\n289*175=289*(100+75)=28900+21675=50575. 50625-50575=50 mod289. So 15^4\u226150 mod289. Adding 1 gives51 mod289.\n\nThen the second term: 4*(15)^3*(17k). 15\u00b3=3375 mod289. Let me compute 15^3=3375. 289*11=3179, 3375-3179=196 mod289. So 4*196=784 mod289. 289*2=578, 784-578=206 mod289. 206 mod289 is206. So 4*15\u00b3=206 mod289. Multiply by17k: 206*17k mod289. 206*17=3502 mod289. Let me compute 289*12=3468. 3502-3468=34 mod289. So 3502\u226134 mod289. Thus, total term is34k mod289. \n\nThus, total expression:\n\n51 +34k \u22610 mod289.\n\nSo 34k \u2261-51 mod289.\n\n34 and 289: GCD(34,289)=17. 51 is 3*17. So 34k \u2261-51 mod289 \u21d2 divide by17:\n\n2k \u2261-3 mod17 \u21d2 2k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2 k\u22617 mod17 (since inverse of2 mod17 is9, 14*9=126\u2261126-7*17=126-119=7 mod17). Wait, inverse of2 mod17 is9 because 2*9=18\u22611 mod17. So 2k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2 k\u226114*9 mod17. 14*9=126 mod17: 17*7=119, so 126-119=7 mod17. So k\u22617 mod17. Thus, k=7+17t. Minimal k=7. So n=15+17*7=15+119=134. Let's see if that works. \n\nCompute 134 mod289 is134. Let me compute 134^4 mod289. That's tedious, but let's try to see:\n\nAlternatively, using the expansion: n=15+17*7=134.\n\n(15 +17*7)^4 mod289. The expansion gave 51 +34*7 mod289. 34*7=238. 51+238=289\u22610 mod289. So yes, that works. So n=134 is another solution. 134 is smaller than155 and179 but larger than110. So the minimal m so far is110. \n\nWait, so all the lifted solutions give n=110,134,155,179. The smallest is110. So 110 is the minimal m for p=17. But is there a smaller prime p?\n\nWait, before that, let me confirm that 17 is indeed the smallest prime where such an n exists. Let me check smaller primes. The problem says \"the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n\u2074+1 is divisible by p\u00b2\". So if there is a prime less than17 where this is possible, then 17 isn't the answer. Let's check primes less than17.\n\nPrimes less than17 are 2,3,5,7,11,13. Let's check each:\n\np=2: As before, n\u2074+1 mod4. For any n, n even: n\u2074\u22610 mod4, so 0+1=1 mod4\u22600. n odd: n\u2074\u22611 mod4, so 1+1=2 mod4\u22600. So no solution.\n\np=3: Check if there exists n with n\u2074 +1\u22610 mod9.\n\nFirst, check mod3: n\u2074 mod3. Since 3 divides n, then n\u2074\u22610 mod3, so 0+1\u22611 mod3\u22600. If n\u22611 or2 mod3:\n\n1\u2074=1 mod3, so 1+1=2 mod3\u22600. Similarly 2\u2074=16\u22611 mod3, so same. So no solution mod3, so mod9 impossible.\n\np=5: Check n\u2074\u2261-1 mod25. First, check mod5. n\u2074 mod5 can be 0 or1. Since 0: n divisible by5, n\u2074\u22610 mod5, so 0+1\u22611\u2260-1. If n not divisible by5, then by Fermat's little theorem, n\u2074\u22611 mod5. So 1+1=2\u2261\u2260-1 mod5. So no solution mod5, so mod25 impossible.\n\np=7: Check mod7 and mod49.\n\nFirst mod7: n\u2074\u2261-1 mod7. Let's see possible residues mod7:\n\nPossible n mod7:0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nn=0:0\u2074+1=1\u2260-1 mod7.\n\nn=1:1+1=2\u2260-1.\n\nn=2:16\u22612 mod7. 2+1=3\u2260-1.\n\nn=3:81\u22614 mod7. 4+1=5\u2260-1.\n\nn=4:256 mod7: 256-7*36=256-252=4 mod7. 4+1=5.\n\nn=5:5\u2074=625 mod7. 625-7*89=625-623=2 mod7. 2+1=3.\n\nn=6:6\u2074=1296 mod7. 1296-7*185=1296-1295=1 mod7. 1+1=2.\n\nNone of them give -1 mod7. Hence no solution mod7, so mod49 impossible.\n\np=11: Check mod11 first. Let's see n\u2074\u2261-1 mod11.\n\nPossible residues mod11:\n\nn=0:0+1=1\u2260-1.\n\nn=1:1+1=2\u2260-1.\n\nn=2:16 mod11=5; 5+1=6\u2260-1.\n\nn=3:81 mod11=4; 4+1=5\u2260-1.\n\nn=4:256 mod11: 256-11*23=256-253=3; 3+1=4.\n\nn=5:625 mod11. 11*56=616, so 625-616=9 mod11. 9+1=10\u2260-1.\n\nn=6:1296 mod11. 11*117=1287, 1296-1287=9 mod11. 9+1=10.\n\nn=7:7\u2074=2401 mod11. 2401-11*218=2401-2400=1 mod11. 1+1=2.\n\nn=8:8\u2074=4096 mod11. 4096-11*372=4096-4092=4 mod11. 4+1=5.\n\nn=9:9\u2074=6561 mod11. 6561-11*596=6561-6556=5 mod11. 5+1=6.\n\nn=10:10\u2074=10000 mod11. 10\u2261-1 mod11, so (-1)^4=1 mod11. 1+1=2.\n\nSo none of the residues mod11 give n\u2074\u2261-1 mod11. Therefore, no solution mod11, so mod121 impossible.\n\np=13: Let's check mod13 first.\n\nn\u2074\u2261-1 mod13. Let's compute n^4 mod13 for n from0 to12.\n\nn=0:0+1=1\u2260-1.\n\nn=1:1+1=2.\n\nn=2:16\u22613 mod13. 3+1=4.\n\nn=3:81\u22614 mod13 (since 13*6=78, 81-78=3? Wait 13*6=78, 81-78=3. Wait 3^4=81 mod13=3 mod13. So 3+1=4.\n\nWait, let me do each step properly.\n\nn=2: 2^4=16 mod13 is 3. So 3+1=4.\n\nn=3:3^4=81 mod13: 13*6=78, 81-78=3 mod13. 3+1=4.\n\nn=4:4^4=256 mod13. 13*19=247, 256-247=9 mod13. 9+1=10.\n\nn=5:5^4=625 mod13. 13*48=624, so 625 mod13=1. 1+1=2.\n\nn=6:6^4=1296 mod13. 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9 mod13. 9+1=10.\n\nn=7:7^4=2401 mod13. 2401 divided by13: 13*184=2392, 2401-2392=9 mod13. 9+1=10.\n\nn=8:8^4=4096 mod13. 13*315=4095, so 4096 mod13=1. 1+1=2.\n\nn=9:9^4=6561 mod13. 13*504=6552, 6561-6552=9 mod13. 9+1=10.\n\nn=10:10^4=10000 mod13. 10\u2261-3 mod13, so (-3)^4=81\u22613 mod13. 3+1=4.\n\nn=11:11\u2261-2 mod13. (-2)^4=16\u22613 mod13. 3+1=4.\n\nn=12:12\u2261-1 mod13. (-1)^4=1 mod13. 1+1=2.\n\nSo none of the residues mod13 give n\u2074\u2261-1 mod13. Therefore, no solution mod13, so mod169 impossible.\n\nThus, primes less than17 (which are 2,3,5,7,11,13) do not have solutions mod p\u00b2. So the smallest prime is indeed17. Therefore, the answer for the first part is p=17, and the minimal m is110.\n\nBut hold on, before I conclude, I should check if there is a smaller m than110 for p=17. Since when we lifted 8 mod17, we got m=110. But perhaps there is a smaller m in another congruence class? For example, maybe 2 mod17's lift gives a smaller m? But 155 is bigger. 134 is smaller than155 and179 but larger than110. So 110 is indeed the smallest.\n\nWait, but let me check n= 8 mod17. The first n greater than8 would be8,25,42,59,76,93,110,... As I computed earlier, n=8 gives residue 50 mod289, which is not 0. n=25 gives187, n=42 gives34, n=59 gives170, n=76 gives17, n=93 gives153, n=110 gives0. So 110 is indeed the first one that works. So 110 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be p=17 and m=110. The problem asks for the least prime p first, then the least m for that p. The question says \"Find the least positive integer m such that m\u2074+1 is divisible by p\u00b2\", so once p is found as17, m is110. Therefore, the final answer is110. Wait, but the problem says \"Answer the following math problem. The last line of your response should be your integer answer within \\boxed{}.\" So since the question is asking for the least positive integer m such that m\u2074+1 is divisible by p\u00b2 where p is the least prime for which such an n exists, so the answer is m=110. So boxed answer is \\boxed{110}\n\nWait, but before I get too confident, let me check if there's any mistake in my calculations for p=17. Let me compute 110^4 +1 mod289 again. Let's compute 110 mod289 is110. Let me compute 110^2 first.\n\n110\u00b2=12100. 12100 divided by289: Let's see 289*41=289*40 +289=11560 +289=11849. 12100-11849=251 mod289. So 110\u00b2\u2261251 mod289.\n\nThen 110^4=(110\u00b2)^2\u2261251\u00b2 mod289. 251 mod289 is251. 251\u00b2=63001. Now divide by289:\n\n289*218=289*(200+18)=57800 +5202=63002. So 251\u00b2=63001\u226163001-63002=-1 mod289. Therefore, 110^4\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 110^4 +1\u22610 mod289. Perfect. So that checks out. \n\nTherefore, I think my conclusion is correct. The minimal prime is17, and the minimal m is110. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{110}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{110}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the smallest prime number p such that there exists a positive integer n where n\u2074 + 1 is divisible by p\u00b2. Then, once I find that prime p, I have to determine the smallest positive integer m such that m\u2074 + 1 is divisible by p\u00b2. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, the problem is about primes squared dividing n\u2074 +1. So, I need to find the smallest prime p where p\u00b2 divides some n\u2074 +1. Then, once that p is found, find the smallest m where the same condition holds. \n\nHmm, primes dividing n\u2074 +1. I know that n\u2074 +1 can sometimes be factored, but over integers, it doesn't factor into polynomials with integer coefficients. Wait, actually, n\u2074 +1 is irreducible over integers, right? So maybe factoring isn't the way to go here. Maybe I need to think about modular arithmetic?\n\nSince p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1, that means n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2. So, we need to find primes p where the congruence x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2 has a solution. And we need the smallest such prime p. Then the minimal m is the smallest solution to that congruence for that p.\n\nI remember that for primes, the congruence x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p has solutions only if certain conditions on p are met. Specifically, I think that -1 must be a fourth power modulo p. Let me recall the conditions for that. \n\nFirst, for the equation x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p to have a solution, the order of -1 modulo p must divide 8, but since -1 has order 2 modulo p (unless p=2, which we can check separately). Wait, actually, the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So, the equation x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p implies that (-1) must be in the subgroup generated by x\u2074. The order of -1 in the multiplicative group is 2, so for this to be a fourth power, 2 must divide the order of the group divided by 4? Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of the multiplicative order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps more straightforwardly: The equation x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p implies that x^8 \u2261 1 mod p, so the order of x modulo p divides 8. But also, the order must not divide 4, otherwise x^4 \u22611 mod p, which would contradict x^4 \u2261-1. Therefore, the order of x must be exactly 8. Therefore, 8 divides the order of the multiplicative group mod p, which is p-1. So, 8 divides p-1, so p \u22611 mod 8.\n\nTherefore, primes p where p \u22611 mod 8 can have solutions to x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p. So primes congruent to 1 mod 8 are candidates. But the question is about p\u00b2 dividing n\u2074 +1, which is a stronger condition.\n\nSo, first, the primes p must satisfy p \u22611 mod 8, because otherwise even mod p there's no solution. But even if there is a solution mod p, we need to see if there is a solution mod p\u00b2.\n\nHmm, so the problem is now to find the smallest prime p \u22611 mod 8 such that the congruence x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2 has a solution, then find the minimal m for that p.\n\nI know that sometimes solutions modulo p can lift to solutions modulo p\u00b2 via Hensel's lemma, but Hensel's lemma requires that the derivative of the polynomial at the root is not divisible by p. Let me recall Hensel's lemma properly.\n\nSuppose f(x) = x\u2074 +1. Suppose we have a solution x \u2261 a mod p such that f(a) \u22610 mod p and f\u2019(a) \u22614a\u00b3 mod p is not \u22610 mod p. Then, there is a unique lift of a modulo p\u00b2. However, if f\u2019(a) \u22610 mod p, then we need to check whether f(a) \u22610 mod p\u00b2 already, in which case there might be multiple solutions or none.\n\nWait, so in our case, f\u2019(x)=4x\u00b3. So, if a is a solution mod p, so a\u2074 \u2261-1 mod p, then f\u2019(a)=4a\u00b3 mod p. For Hensel's lemma to apply, we need 4a\u00b3 not \u22610 mod p. Since p is an odd prime (since p=2 would have 2\u00b2=4, but n\u2074 +1 mod 4: n even, n\u2074 is 0 mod 4, so 0+1=1 mod4, not 0. n odd, n\u2074 is 1 mod4, so 1+1=2 mod4, which also isn't 0 mod4. So p=2 is out. So p is odd. Thus, 4a\u00b3 mod p is 0 only if a\u22610 mod p, but if a\u22610 mod p, then a\u2074 \u22610 mod p, but we need a\u2074 \u2261-1 mod p, which would require -1\u22610 mod p, so p divides 1, which is impossible. Therefore, f\u2019(a) is never 0 mod p for any solution a. Therefore, Hensel's lemma tells us that any solution mod p can be lifted uniquely to mod p\u00b2. Therefore, if there is a solution mod p, then there is a solution mod p\u00b2. Wait, so does that mean that for primes p\u22611 mod8, there is always a solution mod p\u00b2? But the problem says \"the least prime p for which there exists a positive integer n such that n\u2074+1 is divisible by p\u00b2\". If all primes p\u22611 mod8 satisfy this, then the least such prime is the smallest prime \u22611 mod8, which is 17?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me check. The primes congruent to 1 mod8 are 17, 41, 73, 89, etc. The first one is 17. So if the minimal p is 17, then m would be the minimal m such that m\u2074 \u2261-1 mod 17\u00b2. But maybe that's not the case. Wait, perhaps there's a prime p\u22611 mod8 where the solution mod p doesn't lift to mod p\u00b2? But according to Hensel's lemma, it should. Wait, Hensel's lemma says that if f(a) \u22610 mod p and f\u2019(a) not \u22610 mod p, then there exists a unique lift mod p\u00b2. Therefore, the existence of a solution mod p implies existence mod p\u00b2. So if p\u22611 mod8, then there is a solution mod p, which can be lifted to mod p\u00b2, so then n\u2074 +1 divisible by p\u00b2 is possible for such primes. Therefore, the minimal p should be the minimal prime \u22611 mod8, which is 17. Hmm, but maybe that's not the case?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me test with p=17. Let me see if there exists an n such that n\u2074 +1 is divisible by 17\u00b2=289.\n\nFirst, let me find a solution mod17. Since 17\u22611 mod8, so there exists solutions to x\u2074\u2261-1 mod17. Let me find such an x. Let me try numbers from 1 to 16.\n\nLet me compute 3\u2074 mod17: 3^4=81 mod17. 17*4=68, so 81-68=13. 13 mod17 is 13. Not -1.\n\nHow about 4: 4^4=256 mod17. 17*15=255, so 256 mod17 is 1. Not -1.\n\n5^4=625 mod17. 17*36=612, 625-612=13. Again 13.\n\nHmm, 6^4=1296 mod17. Let's divide 1296 by17: 17*76=1292, so 1296 mod17 is 4.\n\n7^4=2401 mod17. 17*141=2397, so 2401 mod17 is 4.\n\n8^4=4096 mod17. 17*241=4097, so mod17 is -1? Wait, 4096 mod17 is 4096-17*241=4096-4097=-1 mod17. So 8^4 \u2261-1 mod17. Oh! So 8 is a solution mod17. Great. So then, by Hensel's lemma, there should be a solution mod17\u00b2.\n\nLet me try to find it. Let me set n =8 +17k, and plug into n^4 +1 \u22610 mod17\u00b2. Let me compute (8+17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nFirst, expand (8 +17k)^4. Let's compute this modulo 17\u00b2. Since 17k is a multiple of 17, so terms beyond the second in the binomial expansion will have higher powers of 17 and hence vanish mod17\u00b2. So:\n\n(8 +17k)^4 = 8^4 + 4*(8)^3*(17k) + 6*(8)^2*(17k)^2 + ... higher terms.\n\nBut modulo 17\u00b2, the terms with (17k)^2 and higher are 17\u00b2*(something), so mod17\u00b2 they are 0. So:\n\n\u22618^4 +4*8\u00b3*17k mod17\u00b2.\n\nWe know that 8^4 \u2261-1 mod17, so mod17\u00b2, 8^4 = -1 +17*m for some integer m. Let me compute 8^4 exactly. 8^2=64, so 8^4=64\u00b2=4096. 4096 divided by17\u00b2=289. 289*14=4046, so 4096-4046=50. So 8^4=4096\u226150 mod289. Since 50 mod17 is 50-2*17=16, which is -1 mod17, so that checks out. So 8^4=50 mod289.\n\nTherefore, (8+17k)^4 +1 \u226150 +4*(8)^3*(17k) +1 mod289.\n\nWait, actually, hold on. Let me recast that. The expansion was (8 +17k)^4 \u22618^4 +4*(8)^3*(17k) mod17\u00b2. Then adding 1 gives:\n\n\u2261 (8^4 +1) +4*(8)^3*(17k) mod17\u00b2.\n\nBut 8^4 +1 mod289 is 50 +1 =51 mod289. So total expression is 51 +4*512*(17k) mod289.\n\nWait, compute 4*(8)^3. 8^3=512, so 4*512=2048. Then 2048*17k mod289.\n\nBut 2048 mod289? Let's compute 289*7=2023, so 2048-2023=25. So 2048 \u226125 mod289. Therefore, 2048*17k mod289 is 25*17k mod289. 25*17=425. 425 mod289 is 425 -289=136. So 425\u2261136 mod289. So total:\n\nThe expression becomes 51 +136k mod289. We need this to be congruent to 0 mod289. So,\n\n51 +136k \u22610 mod289\n\nSolving for k:\n\n136k \u2261-51 mod289\n\nLet me compute 136 and 289. Since 289 is 17\u00b2, and 136 is 17*8. So 136 =17*8, 289=17\u00b2. Let's divide both sides by 17:\n\n17*8 *k \u2261-17*3 mod17\u00b2\n\nDivide both sides by17:\n\n8k \u2261-3 mod17\n\nSo 8k \u226114 mod17 (since -3 mod17 is14).\n\nNow, solve 8k \u226114 mod17.\n\nFind the inverse of8 mod17. 8* x \u22611 mod17. Let's see, 8*2=16\u2261-1 mod17, so 8*(-2)=1 mod17. So inverse of 8 is -2 mod17, which is 15.\n\nSo multiply both sides by15:\n\nk\u226114*15 mod17.\n\n14*15=210. 210 mod17: 17*12=204, so 210-204=6. So k\u22616 mod17.\n\nTherefore, k=6 +17t for some integer t. Since we want the minimal positive n, we can take k=6. Therefore, n=8+17*6=8+102=110. So n=110 is a solution mod289. Let me check that 110\u2074 +1 mod289 is 0?\n\nAlternatively, compute (8 +17*6)^4 +1 mod289. Wait, but we already did the expansion and found that when k=6, the expression is 51 +136*6 mod289. 136*6=816. 816 mod289: 289*2=578, 816-578=238. 238 mod289 is 238. So 51 +238=289\u22610 mod289. Perfect. So n=110 is a solution mod289. So 110\u2074 +1 is divisible by17\u00b2=289. Therefore, 17 is a prime where such an n exists. \n\nBut is there a smaller prime? The next prime less than 17 which is 1 mod8? Let's see, primes congruent to 1 mod8 start at 17, since 1 mod8 primes are 17, 41, 73, etc. The primes less than 17: Let's check primes like 7, which is 7 mod8, 3 mod8, 5 mod8, etc. The next prime after 2,3,5,7,11,13. 17 is the first prime \u22611 mod8. So 17 is the minimal such prime. Wait, but let me confirm if for p=17, there is indeed a solution mod p\u00b2. Which we just saw, n=110. So then the minimal m would be 110? Wait, but maybe there is a smaller m? Since 8 mod17 is the solution mod17, but when lifting to mod289, the minimal solution might be smaller than 110. Wait, in our calculation above, we set n=8 +17k, and found k=6 gives n=110. But maybe there is a smaller k?\n\nWait, let me see. When we solved for k in 8k \u226114 mod17, we found k\u22616 mod17, so the minimal positive k is 6. Therefore, the minimal n would be 8+17*6=110. Alternatively, could there be a smaller n not of the form 8 +17k? Wait, but Hensel's lemma says the solution is unique modulo p\u00b2, so the solution mod p\u00b2 is unique in the congruence class mod p. So the minimal solution would be 8 +17*6=110? Wait, but perhaps the minimal positive solution is actually 17\u00b2 - (something)? Hmm, maybe not. Let me check if 110 is indeed the minimal m such that m\u2074 \u2261-1 mod289. Alternatively, maybe there is a smaller m?\n\nLet me try m=8 mod17, but smaller than 110. Let me try m=8. 8^4=4096 mod289. As before, 4096 mod289: 289*14=4046, 4096-4046=50. So 50 mod289, which is not 0 mod289. So that doesn't work. Next, m=8+17=25. Let's compute 25^4 +1 mod289. 25^2=625, 25^4=(625)^2. 625 mod289: 289*2=578, so 625-578=47. So 25^2 \u226147 mod289. Then 47^2 mod289. 47\u00b2=2209. 289*7=2023. 2209-2023=186. So 25^4 \u2261186 mod289. 186+1=187 mod289\u22600. Not zero.\n\nNext, m=8+34=42. Let me compute 42^4 mod289. 42 mod289 is 42. 42\u00b2=1764. 1764 mod289: 289*6=1734. 1764-1734=30. So 42\u00b2\u226130 mod289. Then 30\u00b2=900 mod289. 289*3=867, so 900-867=33. So 42^4\u226133 mod289. 33+1=34\u22600 mod289.\n\nNext, m=8+51=59. 59 mod289 is 59. 59\u00b2=3481 mod289. 289*12=3468. 3481-3468=13 mod289. So 59\u00b2\u226113. Then 13\u00b2=169 mod289. So 59^4\u2261169 mod289. 169+1=170\u22600.\n\nContinuing, m=8+68=76. 76 mod289 is76. 76\u00b2=5776. 289*20=5780, so 5776 mod289 is -4 mod289. So 76\u00b2\u2261-4. Then (-4)^2=16 mod289. 76^4\u226116 mod289. 16+1=17\u22600.\n\nm=8+85=93. Let me compute 93^4 mod289. 93 mod289 is93. 93\u00b2: 93\u00b2=8649. 289*29=8381. 8649-8381=268 mod289. So 93\u00b2\u2261268 mod289. 268\u00b2 mod289. 268 mod289 is same as -21. So (-21)^2=441 mod289. 441-289=152. So 268\u00b2\u2261152 mod289. 152+1=153\u22600.\n\nNext, m=8+102=110. We know this gives 0 mod289. So indeed, 110 is the first one in that sequence. So 110 is the minimal m for p=17. But is there a smaller m not in the 8+17k sequence?\n\nWait, perhaps another solution mod17? Since in mod17, the equation x\u2074\u2261-1 mod17 has solutions. We found x=8, but maybe there are others?\n\nLet me check. Let's see, since 8 is a solution, then so are 8*(-1)= -8=9 mod17? Wait, let me check 9^4 mod17. 9^2=81\u226113 mod17, so 9^4=13\u00b2=169\u226116\u2261-1 mod17. So 9 is also a solution. Similarly, 8*2=16 mod17? Wait, 16^4: 16\u2261-1 mod17, so (-1)^4=1 mod17, which is not -1. So no. Wait, perhaps the solutions mod17 are 8 and 9, and their negatives?\n\nWait, let's see: The multiplicative group mod17 is cyclic of order16. The solutions to x\u2074 \u2261-1 mod17 are elements of order 8, since x^8\u22611 mod17, but x^4\u2261-1\u22601. So there should be \u03c6(8)=4 solutions. Let me check.\n\nWe found 8 and 9. Let me check 15 mod17. 15 is -2 mod17. Let's compute 15^4 mod17. 15^2=225\u22614 mod17, so 15^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. So 15 is also a solution. Similarly, 16-15=2? Wait, 15^4 is 16 mod17? Wait, 15^2= ( -2)^2=4 mod17, so 15^4=4\u00b2=16 mod17, which is -1 mod17. Yes. So 15 is a solution. Similarly, let's check 6: 6^4 mod17. 6^2=36\u22612 mod17. 2^2=4 mod17. Not -1. 7^4: 7^2=49\u226115 mod17, then 15\u00b2=225\u22614 mod17. Not -1. Wait, maybe 13? 13 mod17. 13\u00b2=169\u226116 mod17. Then 13^4=(16)^2=256\u22611 mod17. Not -1. Hmm, so perhaps the solutions are 8, 9, 15, and another?\n\nWait, let me try 7: 7^4 was 4 mod17? Wait earlier I thought 7^4 was 4 mod17. Let me recheck:\n\n7^2 is 49 mod17. 49-2*17=15. So 7^2\u226115 mod17. Then 7^4=(15)^2=225 mod17. 225-13*17=225-221=4 mod17. So yes, 4 mod17. Not -1. \n\nWait, 14: 14 mod17 is -3. 14^2=9 mod17. 14^4=81 mod17\u226113 mod17. Not -1. \n\nHow about 5: 5\u00b2=25\u22618 mod17. 5^4=64\u226113 mod17. Not -1. \n\nWait, so maybe the solutions are 8,9,15, and another?\n\nWait, let's see, let's list all elements of order 8 in the multiplicative group mod17. The group is cyclic of order16, so elements of order 8 are the generators of the subgroup of order8. Since 16/8=2, so the number is \u03c6(8)=4. Let me see, starting with 3: 3 is a primitive root mod17? Let's see: 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^4=81\u226113, 3^8\u226113\u00b2=169\u226116 mod17. 3^16\u22611 mod17. So 3 has order16. So elements of order8 would be 3^2, 3^6, 3^10, 3^14? Let me check. \n\n3^2=9 mod17. 9^8 mod17: since 9 has order8 (since 9^4= (3^2)^4=3^8\u226116\u2261-1 mod17, so 9^8\u22611 mod17. So yes, order8. Similarly, 3^6: 3^6 mod17. Let me compute 3^3=27\u226110 mod17. 3^6=10^2=100\u226115 mod17. 15 has order8? 15^2=225\u22614 mod17, 15^4\u226116 mod17, 15^8\u22611 mod17. So yes. 3^10=3^(8+2)=3^8*3\u00b2\u2261-1*9\u2261-9\u22618 mod17. So 8 is 3^10 mod17, which would have order8. Similarly 3^14=3^(16-2)=3^{-2}= (3^2)^{-1}=9^{-1} mod17. Since 9*2=18\u22611 mod17, so inverse of 9 is 2 mod17. Wait, but 3^14\u22612 mod17? Wait, perhaps my approach is getting convoluted. Anyway, the solutions mod17 are 8,9,15, and another. Wait, 15 is 3^6, 9 is 3^2, 8 is 3^10, then 3^14 would be another. Let's see 3^14 mod17. 3^14=3^(16-2)= (3^16)*(3^{-2})\u22611*(9^{-1}) mod17. Since 9*2=18\u22611 mod17, so 9^{-1}=2 mod17. Therefore, 3^14\u22612 mod17. Let's check 2^4 mod17. 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Oh! 2^4 is 16\u2261-1 mod17. So 2 is also a solution. Wait, so the solutions are 2,8,9,15 mod17. Let me confirm 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Yes. So 2 is a solution. So the four solutions mod17 are 2,8,9,15. \n\nTherefore, when lifting to mod289, each of these roots mod17 can be lifted to mod289. So perhaps the minimal m is the minimal among the lifts of these roots?\n\nEarlier, we considered lifting 8 mod17 to 110 mod289. Let's see what happens if we lift 2 mod17.\n\nLet me try the solution x=2 mod17. Let's set n=2 +17k. Then compute n^4 +1 mod289. Let's do the expansion again:\n\n(2 +17k)^4 =2^4 +4*2\u00b3*(17k) + ... higher terms. Mod289, the higher terms vanish.\n\nThus:\n\n\u226116 +4*(8)*(17k) mod289.\n\n4*8=32, so 32*17k=544k mod289.\n\n544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255; 255-289=-34 mod289. Wait, 544 mod289: 289*1=289, 544-289=255; 255 mod289 is 255. Wait, 544 is 2*289 + 66? Wait 289*1=289, 289*2=578. 544-578= -34. So 544 mod289 is -34. Wait, maybe better to compute 544 divided by289:\n\n289*1=289, 544-289=255. 255 is still larger than289? No, 255 is less. Wait 255 is less than289. So 544 mod289 is255. Hmm, so 544k mod289 is255k mod289. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 4*2\u00b3*(17k)=4*8*17k= 544k. 544 divided by289 is 1 with remainder 255, so 544k mod289=255k mod289. Therefore:\n\n(2+17k)^4 +1 \u226116 +1 +255k mod289 \u226117 +255k mod289.\n\nSet this \u22610 mod289:\n\n255k \u2261 -17 mod289.\n\n255 and 289: GCD(255,289). 289-255=34. GCD(255,34). 255 mod34: 34*7=238, 255-238=17. GCD(34,17)=17. So GCD is17. Since 17 divides -17, so solution exists. Let's divide equation by17:\n\n255/17=15, 289/17=17, -17/17=-1.\n\nSo 15k \u2261 -1 mod17.\n\nThus, 15k \u226116 mod17. Solve for k.\n\n15 inverse mod17: 15*x\u22611 mod17. 15* 15=225\u22614 mod17, 15*13=195\u2261195-11*17=195-187=8 mod17. 15*7=105\u2261105-6*17=105-102=3 mod17. 15* 4=60\u226160-3*17=60-51=9 mod17. Hmm, maybe 15*(-1)= -15\u22612 mod17. 2*15=30\u226113 mod17. Not helpful. Alternatively, 15*x \u22611 mod17. Let me try x=8: 15*8=120. 120 mod17: 17*7=119, so 120\u22611 mod17. Oh! So inverse of15 mod17 is8. \n\nTherefore, k\u226116*8 mod17. 16*8=128 mod17. 17*7=119, so 128-119=9 mod17. So k\u22619 mod17. Therefore, k=9 +17t. The minimal positive k is9. Thus, n=2 +17*9=2+153=155. So n=155 is another solution mod289. Let me check 155^4 +1 mod289. But that's tedious. Alternatively, we can trust the calculation. But 155 is bigger than 110, so not better.\n\nNext, let's try lifting x=9 mod17. Let me set n=9 +17k. Compute (9+17k)^4 mod289.\n\nAgain, expanding:\n\n9^4 +4*9\u00b3*(17k) mod289. \n\nFirst compute 9^4 mod289. 9^2=81, so 9^4=81\u00b2=6561. 6561 divided by289: 289*22=6358. 6561-6358=203 mod289. So 9^4\u2261203 mod289. Then adding 1 gives 204 mod289. \n\nThen the second term: 4*(9)^3*(17k). 9^3=729. 729 mod289: 289*2=578, 729-578=151 mod289. So 4*151=604 mod289. 604-2*289=604-578=26 mod289. So 4*9\u00b3=26 mod289. Multiply by17k: 26*17k mod289. 26*17=442 mod289. 442-289=153 mod289. So 442\u2261153 mod289. Thus, total expression is:\n\n204 +153k mod289\u22610 mod289.\n\nSo 153k \u2261-204 mod289.\n\nLet me simplify. 153 and 289: GCD(153,289). 289-153=136. GCD(153,136). 153-136=17. GCD(136,17)=17. So GCD is17. Check if 17 divides -204: yes, since 204=12*17. So equation is solvable.\n\nDivide by17: 153/17=9, 289/17=17, -204/17=-12.\n\nThus 9k \u2261-12 mod17.\n\n9k \u22615 mod17 (since -12 mod17 is5).\n\nFind inverse of9 mod17. 9*2=18\u22611 mod17. So inverse is2. Thus:\n\nk\u22615*2=10 mod17. So k=10+17t. Minimal k is10. Then n=9+17*10=9+170=179. So n=179 is another solution. That's bigger than 110, so not better.\n\nNow, the last solution mod17 is15. Let's see: n=15 +17k.\n\nCompute (15 +17k)^4 mod289.\n\nFirst, 15^4 mod289. 15^2=225 mod289. 15^4=225\u00b2. 225 mod289 is225, so 225\u00b2=50625. Let me divide by289:\n\n289*175=289*(100+75)=28900+21675=50575. 50625-50575=50 mod289. So 15^4\u226150 mod289. Adding 1 gives51 mod289.\n\nThen the second term: 4*(15)^3*(17k). 15\u00b3=3375 mod289. Let me compute 15^3=3375. 289*11=3179, 3375-3179=196 mod289. So 4*196=784 mod289. 289*2=578, 784-578=206 mod289. 206 mod289 is206. So 4*15\u00b3=206 mod289. Multiply by17k: 206*17k mod289. 206*17=3502 mod289. Let me compute 289*12=3468. 3502-3468=34 mod289. So 3502\u226134 mod289. Thus, total term is34k mod289. \n\nThus, total expression:\n\n51 +34k \u22610 mod289.\n\nSo 34k \u2261-51 mod289.\n\n34 and 289: GCD(34,289)=17. 51 is 3*17. So 34k \u2261-51 mod289 \u21d2 divide by17:\n\n2k \u2261-3 mod17 \u21d2 2k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2 k\u22617 mod17 (since inverse of2 mod17 is9, 14*9=126\u2261126-7*17=126-119=7 mod17). Wait, inverse of2 mod17 is9 because 2*9=18\u22611 mod17. So 2k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2 k\u226114*9 mod17. 14*9=126 mod17: 17*7=119, so 126-119=7 mod17. So k\u22617 mod17. Thus, k=7+17t. Minimal k=7. So n=15+17*7=15+119=134. Let's see if that works. \n\nCompute 134 mod289 is134. Let me compute 134^4 mod289. That's tedious, but let's try to see:\n\nAlternatively, using the expansion: n=15+17*7=134.\n\n(15 +17*7)^4 mod289. The expansion gave 51 +34*7 mod289. 34*7=238. 51+238=289\u22610 mod289. So yes, that works. So n=134 is another solution. 134 is smaller than155 and179 but larger than110. So the minimal m so far is110. \n\nWait, so all the lifted solutions give n=110,134,155,179. The smallest is110. So 110 is the minimal m for p=17. But is there a smaller prime p?\n\nWait, before that, let me confirm that 17 is indeed the smallest prime where such an n exists. Let me check smaller primes. The problem says \"the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n\u2074+1 is divisible by p\u00b2\". So if there is a prime less than17 where this is possible, then 17 isn't the answer. Let's check primes less than17.\n\nPrimes less than17 are 2,3,5,7,11,13. Let's check each:\n\np=2: As before, n\u2074+1 mod4. For any n, n even: n\u2074\u22610 mod4, so 0+1=1 mod4\u22600. n odd: n\u2074\u22611 mod4, so 1+1=2 mod4\u22600. So no solution.\n\np=3: Check if there exists n with n\u2074 +1\u22610 mod9.\n\nFirst, check mod3: n\u2074 mod3. Since 3 divides n, then n\u2074\u22610 mod3, so 0+1\u22611 mod3\u22600. If n\u22611 or2 mod3:\n\n1\u2074=1 mod3, so 1+1=2 mod3\u22600. Similarly 2\u2074=16\u22611 mod3, so same. So no solution mod3, so mod9 impossible.\n\np=5: Check n\u2074\u2261-1 mod25. First, check mod5. n\u2074 mod5 can be 0 or1. Since 0: n divisible by5, n\u2074\u22610 mod5, so 0+1\u22611\u2260-1. If n not divisible by5, then by Fermat's little theorem, n\u2074\u22611 mod5. So 1+1=2\u2261\u2260-1 mod5. So no solution mod5, so mod25 impossible.\n\np=7: Check mod7 and mod49.\n\nFirst mod7: n\u2074\u2261-1 mod7. Let's see possible residues mod7:\n\nPossible n mod7:0,1,2,3,4,5,6.\n\nn=0:0\u2074+1=1\u2260-1 mod7.\n\nn=1:1+1=2\u2260-1.\n\nn=2:16\u22612 mod7. 2+1=3\u2260-1.\n\nn=3:81\u22614 mod7. 4+1=5\u2260-1.\n\nn=4:256 mod7: 256-7*36=256-252=4 mod7. 4+1=5.\n\nn=5:5\u2074=625 mod7. 625-7*89=625-623=2 mod7. 2+1=3.\n\nn=6:6\u2074=1296 mod7. 1296-7*185=1296-1295=1 mod7. 1+1=2.\n\nNone of them give -1 mod7. Hence no solution mod7, so mod49 impossible.\n\np=11: Check mod11 first. Let's see n\u2074\u2261-1 mod11.\n\nPossible residues mod11:\n\nn=0:0+1=1\u2260-1.\n\nn=1:1+1=2\u2260-1.\n\nn=2:16 mod11=5; 5+1=6\u2260-1.\n\nn=3:81 mod11=4; 4+1=5\u2260-1.\n\nn=4:256 mod11: 256-11*23=256-253=3; 3+1=4.\n\nn=5:625 mod11. 11*56=616, so 625-616=9 mod11. 9+1=10\u2260-1.\n\nn=6:1296 mod11. 11*117=1287, 1296-1287=9 mod11. 9+1=10.\n\nn=7:7\u2074=2401 mod11. 2401-11*218=2401-2400=1 mod11. 1+1=2.\n\nn=8:8\u2074=4096 mod11. 4096-11*372=4096-4092=4 mod11. 4+1=5.\n\nn=9:9\u2074=6561 mod11. 6561-11*596=6561-6556=5 mod11. 5+1=6.\n\nn=10:10\u2074=10000 mod11. 10\u2261-1 mod11, so (-1)^4=1 mod11. 1+1=2.\n\nSo none of the residues mod11 give n\u2074\u2261-1 mod11. Therefore, no solution mod11, so mod121 impossible.\n\np=13: Let's check mod13 first.\n\nn\u2074\u2261-1 mod13. Let's compute n^4 mod13 for n from0 to12.\n\nn=0:0+1=1\u2260-1.\n\nn=1:1+1=2.\n\nn=2:16\u22613 mod13. 3+1=4.\n\nn=3:81\u22614 mod13 (since 13*6=78, 81-78=3? Wait 13*6=78, 81-78=3. Wait 3^4=81 mod13=3 mod13. So 3+1=4.\n\nWait, let me do each step properly.\n\nn=2: 2^4=16 mod13 is 3. So 3+1=4.\n\nn=3:3^4=81 mod13: 13*6=78, 81-78=3 mod13. 3+1=4.\n\nn=4:4^4=256 mod13. 13*19=247, 256-247=9 mod13. 9+1=10.\n\nn=5:5^4=625 mod13. 13*48=624, so 625 mod13=1. 1+1=2.\n\nn=6:6^4=1296 mod13. 13*99=1287, 1296-1287=9 mod13. 9+1=10.\n\nn=7:7^4=2401 mod13. 2401 divided by13: 13*184=2392, 2401-2392=9 mod13. 9+1=10.\n\nn=8:8^4=4096 mod13. 13*315=4095, so 4096 mod13=1. 1+1=2.\n\nn=9:9^4=6561 mod13. 13*504=6552, 6561-6552=9 mod13. 9+1=10.\n\nn=10:10^4=10000 mod13. 10\u2261-3 mod13, so (-3)^4=81\u22613 mod13. 3+1=4.\n\nn=11:11\u2261-2 mod13. (-2)^4=16\u22613 mod13. 3+1=4.\n\nn=12:12\u2261-1 mod13. (-1)^4=1 mod13. 1+1=2.\n\nSo none of the residues mod13 give n\u2074\u2261-1 mod13. Therefore, no solution mod13, so mod169 impossible.\n\nThus, primes less than17 (which are 2,3,5,7,11,13) do not have solutions mod p\u00b2. So the smallest prime is indeed17. Therefore, the answer for the first part is p=17, and the minimal m is110.\n\nBut hold on, before I conclude, I should check if there is a smaller m than110 for p=17. Since when we lifted 8 mod17, we got m=110. But perhaps there is a smaller m in another congruence class? For example, maybe 2 mod17's lift gives a smaller m? But 155 is bigger. 134 is smaller than155 and179 but larger than110. So 110 is indeed the smallest.\n\nWait, but let me check n= 8 mod17. The first n greater than8 would be8,25,42,59,76,93,110,... As I computed earlier, n=8 gives residue 50 mod289, which is not 0. n=25 gives187, n=42 gives34, n=59 gives170, n=76 gives17, n=93 gives153, n=110 gives0. So 110 is indeed the first one that works. So 110 is minimal.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be p=17 and m=110. The problem asks for the least prime p first, then the least m for that p. The question says \"Find the least positive integer m such that m\u2074+1 is divisible by p\u00b2\", so once p is found as17, m is110. Therefore, the final answer is110. Wait, but the problem says \"Answer the following math problem. The last line of your response should be your integer answer within \\boxed{}.\" So since the question is asking for the least positive integer m such that m\u2074+1 is divisible by p\u00b2 where p is the least prime for which such an n exists, so the answer is m=110. So boxed answer is \\boxed{110}\n\nWait, but before I get too confident, let me check if there's any mistake in my calculations for p=17. Let me compute 110^4 +1 mod289 again. Let's compute 110 mod289 is110. Let me compute 110^2 first.\n\n110\u00b2=12100. 12100 divided by289: Let's see 289*41=289*40 +289=11560 +289=11849. 12100-11849=251 mod289. So 110\u00b2\u2261251 mod289.\n\nThen 110^4=(110\u00b2)^2\u2261251\u00b2 mod289. 251 mod289 is251. 251\u00b2=63001. Now divide by289:\n\n289*218=289*(200+18)=57800 +5202=63002. So 251\u00b2=63001\u226163001-63002=-1 mod289. Therefore, 110^4\u2261-1 mod289. Therefore, 110^4 +1\u22610 mod289. Perfect. So that checks out. \n\nTherefore, I think my conclusion is correct. The minimal prime is17, and the minimal m is110. Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{110}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{110}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the smallest prime \\( p \\) such that there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) where \\( n^4 + 1 \\) is divisible by \\( p^2 \\). Then, we need to determine the smallest positive integer \\( m \\) such that \\( m^4 + 1 \\) is divisible by \\( p^2 \\).\n\nFirst, we note that for \\( p^2 \\) to divide \\( n^4 + 1 \\), \\( n^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p^2} \\). This requires that \\( n^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p} \\) first, which implies \\( p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{8} \\) because the multiplicative group modulo \\( p \\) must have an element of order 8. The smallest such prime is 17.\n\nNext, we verify if there exists a solution to \\( n^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17^2} \\). Using Hensel's lemma, we know that solutions modulo \\( p \\) can be lifted to solutions modulo \\( p^2 \\) if the derivative condition is satisfied. For \\( f(x) = x^4 + 1 \\), the derivative \\( f'(x) = 4x^3 \\) is non-zero modulo 17 for any solution \\( x \\), so solutions modulo 17 can be lifted.\n\nWe find that \\( 8 \\) is a solution modulo 17 (since \\( 8^4 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{17} \\)). Lifting this solution to modulo \\( 17^2 \\):\n\nLet \\( n = 8 + 17k \\). Expanding \\( (8 + 17k)^4 + 1 \\mod 289 \\):\n\n\\[\n(8 + 17k)^4 \\equiv 8^4 + 4 \\cdot 8^3 \\cdot 17k \\pmod{289}\n\\]\n\nCalculating terms:\n- \\( 8^4 = 4096 \\equiv 50 \\pmod{289} \\)\n- \\( 4 \\cdot 8^3 \\cdot 17k = 4 \\cdot 512 \\cdot 17k \\equiv 25 \\cdot 17k \\equiv 425k \\equiv 136k \\pmod{289} \\)\n\nThus, we need:\n\\[\n50 + 1 + 136k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{289} \\implies 51 + 136k \\equiv 0 \\pmod{289}\n\\]\n\nSolving \\( 136k \\equiv -51 \\pmod{289} \\):\n- \\( 136 \\equiv 17 \\cdot 8 \\)\n- \\( -51 \\equiv -3 \\cdot 17 \\)\n- Dividing by 17: \\( 8k \\equiv -3 \\pmod{17} \\)\n- \\( 8k \\equiv 14 \\pmod{17} \\)\n- The inverse of 8 modulo 17 is 15, so \\( k \\equiv 14 \\cdot 15 \\equiv 6 \\pmod{17} \\)\n\nThus, \\( k = 6 \\), giving \\( n = 8 + 17 \\cdot 6 = 110 \\).\n\nVerification shows \\( 110^4 + 1 \\equiv 0 \\pmod{289} \\). Checking smaller primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13) confirms none satisfy the condition.\n\nThus, the smallest prime \\( p \\) is 17, and the smallest \\( m \\) is \\(\\boxed{110}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest prime number p such that there's some positive integer n where p squared divides n^4 + 1. Then, once I find that prime p, I have to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, the problem is about primes and divisibility. Specifically, we're looking for primes p where p squared divides n^4 + 1 for some n. The question is asking for the smallest such prime p and then the smallest m for that p.\n\nHmm, primes where p squared divides n^4 + 1... So, n^4 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2. That congruence needs to hold. Since p is prime, maybe we can use some number theory here. Let me recall that if p is an odd prime, then the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So, for the equation x^4 \u2261 -1 mod p to have a solution, -1 must be a fourth power modulo p. That requires that -1 is in the subgroup generated by a primitive root. But to have x^4 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2, maybe similar conditions apply?\n\nWait, but first, let's think about primes for which -1 is a fourth power modulo p. Let me recall that for -1 to be a quadratic residue modulo p, p must be 1 mod 4. But for it to be a fourth power, perhaps more restrictive conditions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to look for primes p where p\u00b2 divides n^4 +1. Let me think of small primes first and see if any of them satisfy this condition. Since the question is asking for the least prime p, maybe p is not too big. Let me check primes one by one starting from the smallest primes.\n\nStarting with p=2: Let's see if 2\u00b2 divides n^4 +1. So 4 divides n^4 +1. Let's check possible n mod 4. n can be 0,1,2,3 mod 4.\n\nn=0 mod4: n^4=0 mod4, so n^4+1=1 mod4. Not divisible by 4.\n\nn=1 mod4: 1+1=2 mod4. Not divisible by 4.\n\nn=2 mod4: 16 mod4 is 0, so 0+1=1 mod4. Not divisible.\n\nn=3 mod4: 81 mod4 is 1, so again 1+1=2 mod4. Not divisible. So 4 can't divide n^4+1. Therefore p=2 is out.\n\nNext prime p=3: Check if 3\u00b2=9 divides n^4 +1. Let's see possible n mod9. Wait, maybe first check modulo 3 first. Let's see if n^4 \u2261 -1 mod3. Since mod3, n can be 0,1,2.\n\nn=0: 0 +1=1 mod3\u2260-1.\n\nn=1: 1+1=2\u2261-1 mod3. Wait, actually n=1 mod3 gives 1^4=1 mod3, so 1+1=2\u2261-1 mod3. So n^4 \u2261 -1 mod3 is possible. But we need mod9. Let's check n=1 mod3. Let's see n=1: 1+1=2 mod9, not divisible by 9. n=4: 4^4 is 256 mod9. Let's compute 4^4: 4^2=16\u22617 mod9, then 7^2=49\u22614 mod9. So 4^4 +1=4+1=5 mod9. Not 0.\n\nn=7 mod9? Let's try n=7: 7 mod9. 7^4: 7^2=49\u22614 mod9, then 4^2=16\u22617 mod9. So 7^4 +1=7+1=8 mod9. Still not 0. How about n=2 mod3? Let's try n=2. 2^4=16\u22617 mod9, so 7+1=8 mod9. Not 0. Hmm, maybe n=5? Let's see n=5 mod9: 5^4. 5^2=25\u22617 mod9, then squared is 49\u22614 mod9, so 4+1=5 mod9. Not 0. Hmm. So maybe 3\u00b2 can't divide n^4+1. So p=3 is out.\n\nNext prime p=5. Let's check if 25 divides n^4 +1. Let me check possible n mod5 first. Since n^4 mod5: By Fermat's little theorem, n^4 \u22611 mod5 when n not divisible by 5. So n^4 +1 \u22612 mod5. So if n is not divisible by 5, n^4 +1 \u22612 mod5. If n is divisible by 5, then n^4 is 0 mod5, so n^4 +1 \u22611 mod5. So in no case is n^4 +1 divisible by 5, let alone 25. Therefore p=5 is out.\n\nNext prime p=7. Let's see. Check if 49 divides n^4 +1. Again, first check modulo7. Let's compute n^4 mod7. Since 7 is prime, and 4 divides 6 (the order of the multiplicative group), so the fourth powers mod7. Let's compute n^4 mod7 for n=1 to 6:\n\n1^4=1 mod7\n\n2^4=16\u22612 mod7\n\n3^4=81\u22614 mod7 (since 3^2=9\u22612, so squared again is 4 mod7)\n\n4^4: same as (4 mod7)^4. 4 mod7 is 4, so 4^2=16\u22612 mod7, so squared again is 4 mod7. So 4^4\u22614 mod7.\n\n5^4: 5 mod7 is -2, so (-2)^4=16\u22612 mod7.\n\n6^4: 6 mod7 is -1, so (-1)^4=1 mod7.\n\nSo the possible fourth powers mod7 are 1,2,4. So n^4 +1 mod7 can be 2,3,5. None of these are 0 mod7. Therefore n^4 +1 is never divisible by 7, so p=7 is out.\n\nMoving on to p=11? Wait, let's check p=13 first? Wait, maybe check p=17? Hmm, perhaps I should go in order.\n\nWait, next prime after 7 is 11. Let's check p=11. Let me see if 121 divides n^4 +1.\n\nFirst, check mod11. Let's see n^4 mod11. Since 11 is prime, the multiplicative order is 10. 4 divides 10? 10 divided by gcd(4,10)=2, so the order of the subgroup is 5? Wait, maybe better to compute n^4 mod11 for n from 1 to 10.\n\n1^4=1 mod11\n\n2^4=16\u22615 mod11\n\n3^4=81\u22614 mod11 (since 3^2=9, squared again is 81 mod11=4)\n\n4^4=256 mod11. 256 divided by 11: 11*23=253, so 256-253=3 mod11. So 3.\n\n5^4: 5^2=25\u22613 mod11, so squared again 3^2=9 mod11. So 9.\n\n6^4: 6^2=36\u22613 mod11, squared again 9 mod11.\n\n7^4: 7 mod11 is -4, so (-4)^4=256\u22613 mod11 (same as 4^4).\n\n8^4: 8 mod11 is -3, so (-3)^4=81\u22614 mod11 (same as 3^4).\n\n9^4: 9 mod11 is -2, so (-2)^4=16\u22615 mod11 (same as 2^4).\n\n10^4: 10 mod11 is -1, so (-1)^4=1 mod11 (same as 1^4).\n\nSo the fourth powers mod11 are 1,3,4,5,9. Thus, n^4 +1 mod11 can be 2,4,5,6,10. None of which are 0 mod11. So 11 is out.\n\nHmm, moving on to p=13. Let's check p=13.\n\nFirst check mod13. Let me compute n^4 mod13.\n\n1^4=1 mod13.\n\n2^4=16\u22613 mod13.\n\n3^4=81\u226181-65=16? Wait, 13*6=78, so 81-78=3 mod13. Wait, no: 3^4=81. 13*6=78, so 81-78=3. So 3 mod13.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait 3^2=9, so 3^4=81 mod13. Let's compute 13*6=78, so 81-78=3. So yes, 3 mod13.\n\n4^4: 4^2=16\u22613 mod13, then squared again: 3^2=9 mod13. So 9 mod13.\n\n5^4: 5^2=25\u226112 mod13, so squared again: 12^2=144 mod13. 13*11=143, so 144-143=1 mod13. So 1 mod13.\n\n6^4: 6^2=36\u226110 mod13, so squared again: 10^2=100 mod13. 13*7=91, so 100-91=9 mod13.\n\n7^4: 7^2=49\u226110 mod13 (since 13*3=39, 49-39=10), then squared again: 10^2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n8^4: 8 mod13 is -5, so (-5)^4=625 mod13. Let's compute 13*48=624, so 625\u22611 mod13. So 1 mod13.\n\n9^4: 9 mod13 is -4, so (-4)^4=256 mod13. 256 divided by 13: 13*19=247, so 256-247=9 mod13.\n\n10^4: 10 mod13 is -3, so (-3)^4=81\u22613 mod13 (as before).\n\n11^4: 11 mod13 is -2, so (-2)^4=16\u22613 mod13.\n\n12^4: 12 mod13 is -1, so (-1)^4=1 mod13.\n\nSo the fourth powers mod13 are 1, 3, 9. Thus, n^4 +1 mod13 can be 2,4,10. None of these are 0 mod13. So p=13 is out.\n\nHmm, this is tedious. Maybe there's a better way. Let me think. The problem requires that p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1. So, in particular, n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2. For such a congruence to hold, first, n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p must hold. So first, we can narrow down primes p where -1 is a quartic residue mod p. \n\nThe necessary condition for -1 being a quartic residue mod p is that p \u22611 mod 8. Because, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. To have a fourth root of -1, the equation x\u2074 = -1 mod p must have solutions. Since -1 is a square only if p\u22611 mod 4. For it to be a fourth power, the exponent 4 must divide the order of the multiplicative group divided by 2 (since -1 is a square). Wait, perhaps better to recall that the quartic residues mod p require that 8 divides the order of the group? Wait, let me think again.\n\nLet me recall that in the multiplicative group mod p (which is cyclic of order p-1), the equation x^4 = -1 has a solution if and only if the order of -1 in the group divides (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Wait, maybe it's better to note that -1 must be an element of order dividing 2, so for x^4 = -1, we need that (-1)^2 =1, so the order of x must be 8? Hmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let me recall a theorem: \n\nThe equation x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p has solutions if and only if p \u2261 1 mod 8. Because, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. For the equation x\u2074 = -1 to have a solution, the order of -1 in the group must divide (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Alternatively, since -1 is an element of order 2, so to have x^4 = -1, then the order of x must be 8, so 8 divides the order of the group (p-1). Therefore, p \u22611 mod 8. So primes p \u22611 mod8 are candidates.\n\nTherefore, primes p \u22611 mod8. The smallest such primes are 17, 41, 73, 89, 97, etc. So starting from the smallest, 17.\n\nSo maybe p=17 is the first candidate. Let me check if 17 squared divides n^4 +1 for some n. Let me first check mod17 to see if there exists n with n^4 \u2261-1 mod17.\n\nSince 17\u22611 mod8, so it should have solutions. Let me compute n^4 mod17. Let's see, let's try some numbers:\n\nLet me try n=4: 4^4 =256. 256 mod17: 17*15=255, so 256 mod17 is 1. So 1 mod17. Not -1.\n\nn=2: 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Oh! Wait, 2^4 is 16, which is -1 mod17. So 2^4 \u2261 -1 mod17. So n=2 works mod17. So that's good. So 2^4 +1 is divisible by 17. But we need divisibility by 17\u00b2. So check if 2^4 +1 is divisible by 17\u00b2. 2^4 +1 =16 +1=17. Which is 17, so only divisible by 17 once, not 17\u00b2. So n=2 won't work for p=17.\n\nTherefore, need to find an n such that n^4 \u2261-1 mod17\u00b2. So need to lift the solution from mod17 to mod17\u00b2. Maybe using Hensel's lemma?\n\nHensel's lemma says that if f(n) \u22610 mod p and f'(n) not \u22610 mod p, then there's a unique lift mod p\u00b2. Let me see.\n\nLet f(n)=n\u2074 +1. We have f(2)=17 mod17\u00b2. So f(2)\u22610 mod17, but mod17\u00b2 it's 17. The derivative f\u2019(n)=4n\u00b3. At n=2, f\u2019(2)=4*(8)=32\u226132-17=15 mod17. Which is not 0 mod17. Therefore, by Hensel's lemma, there is a unique solution mod17\u00b2 congruent to 2 mod17. So we can find n=2 +17k such that (2+17k)^4 +1 \u22610 mod17\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute (2 +17k)^4 mod17\u00b2. Let me expand this using the binomial theorem:\n\n(2 +17k)^4 = 2^4 + 4*2^3*(17k) + 6*2^2*(17k)^2 + 4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4\n\nBut since we are working mod17\u00b2, terms with 17\u00b2 or higher can be ignored except for the first two terms. Wait:\n\nLet me compute each term modulo17\u00b2:\n\nFirst term: 2^4=16.\n\nSecond term: 4*(8)*(17k)=32*17k. 32 mod17 is 32-17=15, so 15*17k mod17\u00b2 is 15*17k.\n\nThird term: 6*(4)*(17k)^2. Since (17k)^2 is 289k\u00b2, which is 0 mod17\u00b2. So the third term is 24*(289k\u00b2) which is 0 mod17\u00b2. Similarly, the fourth term has (17k)^3, which is 0 mod17\u00b2, and the last term is (17k)^4 mod17\u00b2 which is 0. So overall, modulo17\u00b2, the expansion is:\n\n16 + 15*17k mod17\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, setting this equal to -1 mod17\u00b2:\n\n16 +15*17k \u2261 -1 mod17\u00b2\n\nSo 16 +15*17k +1 \u22610 mod17\u00b2\n\n17 + 15*17k \u22610 mod17\u00b2\n\nFactor out 17:\n\n17*(1 +15k) \u22610 mod17\u00b2\n\nTherefore, 1 +15k \u22610 mod17\n\nSo 15k \u2261 -1 mod17\n\nMultiply both sides by the inverse of 15 mod17. 15 and 17 are coprime, so inverse exists. Let me find 15^{-1} mod17.\n\n15x \u22611 mod17. Trying x= 15*? Let's see 15*15=225. 225 mod17: 17*13=221, so 225-221=4. Not 1. 15* 8=120. 120 mod17: 17*7=119, so 1. So 15*8=120\u22611 mod17. Wait 15*8=120. 120 divided by17: 17*7=119, so 120-119=1. Yes. So inverse is 8. So multiply both sides by8:\n\nk\u2261 -1*8 mod17 \u21d2 k\u2261 -8 mod17 \u21d2 k\u22619 mod17.\n\nSo k=9 mod17. The smallest positive k is 9. Therefore, n=2 +17*9 mod17\u00b2.\n\nCompute 17*9=153. So n=2+153=155. Thus, n=155 mod17\u00b2. Let me check if 155^4 +1 is divisible by 17\u00b2.\n\nBut let's verify the calculation. Let's compute (2 +17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2 where k=9:\n\nWe had the expansion gives 16 +15*17*9 mod17\u00b2. 15*9=135. 135 mod17? Wait, but we already know the equation reduces to 17*(1 +15k)=0 mod17\u00b2, so with k=9, 1+15*9=1+135=136. 136 mod17 is 136 divided by17: 17*8=136, so 136 mod17 is 0. So 17*0=0 mod17\u00b2. Therefore, it works. So n=155 is a solution mod17\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, 155^4 +1 is divisible by 17\u00b2. Therefore, p=17 is a prime where such an n exists. Is there a smaller prime?\n\nWait, before confirming that 17 is the smallest prime, let me check primes between 7 and 17. Wait, after 7 came 11,13, which we checked. Then 17 is next. So 17 is the first prime \u22611 mod8. So yes, 17 is the smallest prime where such an n exists.\n\nSo the first part answer is p=17, then we have to find the minimal m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by17\u00b2. The minimal positive integer m would be the minimal solution mod17\u00b2, which we found as 155, but maybe there is a smaller m?\n\nWait, when we applied Hensel's lemma, we started from n=2 mod17. The solution mod17\u00b2 is 2 +17k where k\u22619 mod17. So the minimal positive solution is 2 +17*9=155. But perhaps there is a smaller n?\n\nWait, let me see. Let me try n=2 +17k where k=0 gives n=2, which gives 17, not 17\u00b2. k=1 gives n=19. Let's compute 19^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nCompute 19 mod17 is 2, so 19 \u22612 mod17. So 19^4 \u22612^4=16 mod17\u00b2? Wait, but 19 is 2 +17*1. Let's compute (2 +17)^4 mod17\u00b2.\n\nUsing the same expansion as before:\n\n(2 +17)^4 = 16 +15*17*1 mod17\u00b2. So 16 +15*17=16 +255=271. 271 mod17\u00b2 (289). 271 is less than 289, so 271. 271 +1=272. So 272 mod289 is 272, so not 0 mod289. So k=1 doesn't work.\n\nk=2: n=2+17*2=36. Let's see (2 +34)^4 mod17\u00b2. Let me compute:\n\n(2 +34)^4. Again, binomial expansion mod17\u00b2.\n\nWait, but 34 is 2*17, so let me compute (2 + 2*17)^4:\n\nFirst term: 2^4=16\n\nSecond term: 4*(2^3)*(2*17)=4*8*34= 4*8*2*17= 64*17= 1088 mod17\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe better to use the previous approach:\n\nLet me use the formula (2 +17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2. Let me compute for k=2:\n\nThe expansion gives 16 +15*17k mod17\u00b2. So with k=2, that's 16 +15*34=16 + 510=526 mod289. Let's compute 526 mod289: 289*1=289, 526-289=237. 237 mod289. So 526 mod289=237. Then adding 1 (from the +1 in the original equation?), wait, no, actually, the expansion was (2 +17k)^4 = 16 +15*17k mod17\u00b2, so adding 1 gives 17 +15*17k mod17\u00b2. Wait, hold on:\n\nWait in the previous calculation, we had (2+17k)^4 +1 = [16 +15*17k] +1 =17 +15*17k mod17\u00b2. So setting this equal to 0 mod17\u00b2:\n\n17*(1 +15k) \u22610 mod17\u00b2 \u21d21 +15k\u22610 mod17. So for k=2, 1+15*2=31\u226131-34= -3 mod17\u226114 mod17\u22600. So indeed, not 0.\n\nSo for k=9, 1+15*9=1+135=136\u22610 mod17. So that works. So the minimal positive k is 9, leading to n=2+17*9=155. So 155 is the minimal n mod17\u00b2. But maybe there is a smaller n?\n\nWait, perhaps there is another solution from another initial solution mod17. Because in mod17, the equation x^4\u2261-1 mod17 had solutions. Let's see, 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Also, since the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 16 (since 17 is prime, so group order 16), then the solutions to x^4\u2261-1 would be the elements of order 8, perhaps?\n\nWait, in the multiplicative group mod17, the elements of order 8 satisfy x^8\u22611 mod17, but x^4\u2261-1 mod17. So the solutions to x^4\u2261-1 mod17 are the elements of order 8. Since the group is cyclic of order 16, the number of elements of order 8 is \u03c6(8)=4. Therefore, there are four solutions mod17. So besides 2, there might be others.\n\nLet me find all solutions to x^4\u2261-1 mod17.\n\nWe know that 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Let me check other numbers:\n\nLet me try 4: 4^4=256\u2261256-15*17=256-255=1 mod17. Not -1.\n\n5: 5^4 mod17. 5^2=25\u22618 mod17, so squared again: 8^2=64\u226113 mod17. Not -1.\n\nWait 3: 3^4=81 mod17. 17*4=68, so 81-68=13 mod17. Not -1.\n\nHow about 8? 8^4. 8 mod17 is 8. 8^2=64\u226113 mod17. 13^2=169\u226116 mod17. So 8^4\u226116\u2261-1 mod17. So 8 is another solution.\n\nSimilarly, 15 mod17 is -2, so (-2)^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. So 15 is another solution. Similarly, let's see 15's counterpart?\n\nWait 8, 2, 15, and maybe another?\n\nWait 16 mod17 is -1, so (-1)^4=1 mod17. Not -1.\n\nWait let's see 9 mod17. 9^2=81\u226113 mod17. Then squared again 13^2=169\u226116 mod17. So 9^4\u226116\u2261-1 mod17. Wait 9?\n\nWait 9^4: 9^2=81\u226113 mod17, then squared: 13^2=169\u226116 mod17. So yes. So 9 is another solution. Similarly, 8, 9, 2, 15?\n\nWait, let me check 10: 10^2=100\u226115 mod17, then squared: 15^2=225\u22614 mod17. So 10^4\u22614 mod17. Not -1.\n\nHmm. So the solutions mod17 are 2, 8, 9, 15? Let's check 15: 15^4. 15\u2261-2 mod17, so (-2)^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Correct. 8^4=16, 9^4= (9)^2 squared: 9^2=81\u226113, so 13^2=169\u226116 mod17. Yes. So the four solutions mod17 are 2, 8, 9, 15.\n\nTherefore, each of these four solutions mod17 can be lifted to mod17\u00b2 via Hensel's lemma. So perhaps there are four solutions mod17\u00b2. Each of the four initial roots can be lifted. So maybe there is a smaller m than 155?\n\nLet's check starting with n=8 mod17. Let's try lifting n=8 mod17.\n\nLet me do the same process for n=8 mod17. Let me set n=8 +17k. Then compute (8+17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nAgain using binomial expansion:\n\n(8 +17k)^4 =8^4 +4*8^3*(17k) + ... higher terms mod17\u00b2.\n\nFirst term:8^4 mod17\u00b2. Let's compute 8^4: 8^2=64, 8^4=64^2=4096. 4096 mod17\u00b2 (289):\n\nCompute 289*14=4046. 4096 -4046=50. So 8^4\u226150 mod289.\n\nWait, but mod17, 8^4\u2261-1 mod17. Let's confirm 50 mod17: 17*2=34, 50-34=16\u2261-1 mod17. So that's correct.\n\nThen the second term:4*(8^3)*(17k). Let's compute 8^3=512. 512 mod17: 17*30=510, so 512\u22612 mod17. So 8^3\u22612 mod17. Therefore, 4*8^3=4*2=8 mod17. Thus, the second term is 8*(17k)* mod17\u00b2. But more precisely, let's compute the coefficient mod17\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step. The second term is 4*(8)^3*(17k). 8^3=512. 512*4=2048. Multiply by17k: 2048*17k. But mod17\u00b2, 17k is a factor, so 2048 mod17. Let's compute 2048 mod17:\n\n17*120=2040, so 2048-2040=8 mod17. So 2048\u22618 mod17. Therefore, the second term is 8*17k mod17\u00b2. So 136k mod17\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the total expansion mod17\u00b2:\n\nFirst term:50 mod289.\n\nSecond term:136k mod289.\n\nThird terms are multiples of (17)^2, so 0 mod17\u00b2.\n\nSo total expression: (8+17k)^4 +1 \u226150 +136k +1 mod289 =51 +136k mod289.\n\nSet this equal to 0 mod289:\n\n51 +136k \u22610 mod289 \u21d2136k \u2261-51 mod289.\n\nDivide both sides by gcd(136,289). Let's compute gcd(136,289). 289 is 17\u00b2, 136 is 17*8. So gcd is17.\n\nThus, divide equation by17: 8k \u2261-3 mod17 (since 51/17=3, 136/17=8, 289/17=17).\n\nSo 8k \u2261-3 mod17 \u21d28k \u226114 mod17.\n\nMultiply both sides by inverse of8 mod17. 8 and17 are coprime. 8*?\u22611 mod17. 8*2=16\u2261-1 mod17. So 8*(-2)=1 mod17 \u21d2 inverse is -2\u226115 mod17.\n\nThus, k\u226114*15 mod17.\n\n14*15=210 mod17: 17*12=204, so 210-204=6 mod17. So k\u22616 mod17.\n\nThus, the minimal k is6, so n=8 +17*6=8+102=110.\n\nCheck if 110 is smaller than 155. Yes, 110 is smaller. Let me verify n=110:\n\nCompute 110 mod17 is 110-17*6=110-102=8 mod17, which is correct. Let's compute (110)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nBut using the previous calculation, when k=6, the expression is 51+136*6=51+816=867 mod289. 867 divided by289: 289*3=867. So 867\u22610 mod289. So yes, it works. Thus, n=110 is a solution mod17\u00b2. So that's smaller than 155. Hmm, so maybe 110 is smaller?\n\nSimilarly, let's check the other roots. Let me try n=9 mod17. Let me do the same process for n=9 mod17.\n\nLet n=9 +17k. Compute (9 +17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nFirst term:9^4 mod289. Compute 9^4= (9^2)^2=81^2=6561. 6561 divided by289: 289*22=6358, 6561-6358=203 mod289.\n\nCheck mod17: 203 mod17: 17*11=187, 203-187=16\u2261-1 mod17. Correct.\n\nSecond term:4*(9)^3*(17k). Compute 9^3=729 mod289. Wait, but mod17: 9^3 mod17. 9 mod17 is9, 9^2=81\u226113 mod17, so 9^3=9*13=117\u2261117-102=15 mod17. Therefore, 9^3\u226115 mod17. Then 4*15=60 mod17. 60 mod17: 17*3=51, 60-51=9 mod17. So 4*9^3 \u22619 mod17. Then multiplied by17k gives 9*17k mod17\u00b2. Thus the second term is 153k mod289.\n\nSo total expression mod289: first term 203 + second term153k +1. So total is 204 +153k mod289.\n\nSet to 0 mod289:\n\n204 +153k \u22610 mod289 \u21d2153k \u2261-204 mod289.\n\nAgain, gcd(153,289). 153=9*17, 289=17\u00b2. So gcd is17. Divide by17:\n\n9k \u2261-12 mod17 (since 204/17=12, 153/17=9, 289/17=17)\n\nSo 9k \u22615 mod17 (since -12 mod17 is 5).\n\nFind inverse of9 mod17. 9*2=18\u22611 mod17. So inverse is2.\n\nThus, k\u22615*2=10 mod17.\n\nThus, k=10 mod17. The minimal k is10, so n=9 +17*10=9+170=179. Hmm, 179 is bigger than 110, so not better.\n\nNow check n=15 mod17. Let me see. Let me take n=15 mod17. Let n=15+17k.\n\nCompute (15 +17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nFirst term:15^4 mod289. 15 is -2 mod17, so 15^4=(-2)^4=16 mod17, but mod289:\n\nCompute 15^2=225, 15^4=225\u00b2=50625. Let's divide 50625 by289.\n\n289*175=289*(170+5)=289*170=49130 +289*5=1445 \u2192 total 49130+1445=50575. 50625-50575=50 mod289. So 15^4\u226150 mod289.\n\nWait, but 15 mod17 is -2, so 15^4\u2261(-2)^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. 50 mod17 is 50-51= -1, yes. So first term is50.\n\nSecond term:4*(15)^3*(17k). 15^3 mod17: (-2)^3= -8 mod17. So 4*(-8)= -32\u2261-32+51=19 mod17? Wait better to compute mod17 first.\n\n15^3 mod17 is (-2)^3= -8 mod17. So 4*(-8)= -32 mod17. -32 mod17: 17*2=34, so -32= -32 +34=2 mod17. So 4*15^3\u22612 mod17. Then multiplied by17k gives 2*17k mod289. So second term is34k mod289.\n\nThus total expression mod289:\n\n50 +34k +1=51 +34k mod289.\n\nSet to 0: 51 +34k\u22610 mod289 \u21d234k\u2261-51 mod289.\n\nDivide by gcd(34,289). 34=2*17, 289=17\u00b2, so gcd=17. Divide equation by17: 2k \u2261-3 mod17 \u21d22k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2k\u22617 mod17 (since 2*7=14). So k=7 mod17. The minimal k is7, so n=15 +17*7=15+119=134. Check if 134 is smaller than 110? 134>110, so no.\n\nSo the minimal m so far is 110 from the n=8 case. Let me see if there's a smaller one.\n\nWait, let's check n=8+17*6=110. Is there a smaller k? Since k must be congruent to6 mod17, the minimal positive k is6, so 110 is the minimal for that root.\n\nSimilarly, the other roots gave 155,179,134, which are larger. So the minimal m is110?\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. The solutions mod17 can be lifted, but perhaps there's a solution less than 110?\n\nWait, the minimal positive solution would be the minimal among all the lifted solutions. Since 110 is the smallest so far, let's see if there is a smaller n.\n\nWait, let's check n=110. Let me compute 110^4 +1 divided by 289. Let me compute 110 mod289 is110. Let's compute 110^4 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, since we already did the calculation with k=6, and found that 51+136*6=51+816=867=3*289=867, so 867 mod289 is0. So yes, correct.\n\nBut maybe there is a smaller n?\n\nWait, maybe n=17\u00b2 - something? Let me see, 17\u00b2 is289, so numbers less than 289. The solutions mod289 would be 110,155,134,179, etc., but perhaps even smaller?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n= 110-289= negative, so no. The minimal positive solution is 110. Wait, but let me check n= 110-17*17=110-289= negative. So no.\n\nWait, but maybe when lifting from n=2 mod17, the solution was n=155, but maybe there's a negative k? For example, if k=9-17= -8, then n=2+17*(-8)=2-136= -134 mod289. Which is 289-134=155. Wait, no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation for n=8 mod17?\n\nWait let me check n=110. Let me compute 110^4 +1 divided by 289.\n\nFirst compute 110^2: 110*110=12100. 12100 mod289. Let me divide 12100 by289:\n\n289*41=289*40 +289=11560+289=11849. 12100-11849=251. So 110\u00b2\u2261251 mod289.\n\nThen 251\u00b2 mod289. Compute 251^2:\n\n251^2 = (250+1)^2 = 62500 + 500 +1=63001. Wait that's too big. Alternatively, compute 251 mod289 is251.\n\n251^2 mod289:\n\nLet me compute 251 mod289 is251.\n\nCompute 251^2: 251*251.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n251 *251:\n\nFirst 200*200=40,000\n\n200*51=10,200\n\n51*200=10,200\n\n51*51=2,601\n\nAdding up: 40,000 + 10,200 +10,200 +2,600= 63,000? Wait no, perhaps better:\n\nWait actually, 251*251 = (250+1)^2 = 250\u00b2 + 2*250*1 +1\u00b2 =62,500 +500 +1=63,001.\n\nNow divide 63,001 by289:\n\n289*218=289*(200+18)=289*200=57,800; 289*18=5,202 \u2192 total 57,800 +5,202=63,002. Hmm, 289*218=63,002. But 63,001 is one less, so 63,001 mod289= -1 mod289. Therefore, (110)^4 \u2261251\u00b2 \u2261-1 mod289. Thus, 110^4 +1 \u22610 mod289. Correct.\n\nTherefore, 110 is indeed a solution. Now, is there a smaller n?\n\nWait let's check n= 110-17=93. Let's see if 93 works. Let me compute 93^4 +1 mod289.\n\nFirst compute 93 mod17: 93 divided by17: 17*5=85, so 93-85=8 mod17. So 93\u22618 mod17. So similar to n=8 mod17. So perhaps 93 is another solution? Wait but when k=6, n=8+17*6=110. If k= -11 mod17 (since k\u22616 mod17, so k=6-17= -11). Then n=8 +17*(-11)=8-187= -179 mod289. Which is 289-179=110. Wait, so negative k would give larger numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another solution with smaller n?\n\nWait let me check n= 155-289= negative. Not useful.\n\nWait let me check n= 110 is the minimal positive solution. Let me check n= 110-289 is negative. So the minimal positive is 110.\n\nWait but let me check another root. Let me try n= 2 mod17, but with k=9, giving n=155, which is bigger. The next possible solution from n=8 mod17 would be n=110-17=93, but that's less than 110 but would that be a solution? Let me check n=93 mod17 is8 mod17. Let me compute (93)^4 +1 mod289.\n\nCompute 93 mod289 is93. Let me compute 93^2 first: 93\u00b2=8649. 8649 divided by289:\n\n289*30=8670, so 8649-8670= -21 mod289. So 93\u00b2\u2261-21 mod289.\n\nThen 93^4 = (93\u00b2)^2 \u2261 (-21)^2=441 mod289. 441-289=152 mod289. So 93^4\u2261152 mod289. Then 152+1=153 mod289\u22600. So no, 93 is not a solution. So my mistake, just being mod17 isn't enough. The lifting requires the specific k.\n\nThus, the minimal solution is indeed 110. Wait, but let me check another way. Let me see if there is a smaller n than 110 where n^4 +1 is divisible by17\u00b2.\n\nLet me check n= 8 mod17, so n=8,25,42,... up to 110. Let's try n=8+17*1=25. Let me compute 25^4 +1 mod289.\n\n25 mod17 is8, so 25\u22618 mod17. Compute 25^4 mod289.\n\n25^2=625 mod289. 289*2=578, so 625-578=47 mod289. So 25\u00b2\u226147 mod289.\n\nThen 25^4=47\u00b2=2209 mod289. 289*7=2023. 2209-2023=186 mod289. So 25^4\u2261186 mod289. 186+1=187 mod289\u22600. So no.\n\nNext n=25+17=42. 42 mod17 is42-34=8 mod17. Compute 42^4 mod289.\n\n42 mod289=42. 42\u00b2=1764 mod289. 289*6=1734, 1764-1734=30 mod289. So 42\u00b2\u226130 mod289.\n\nThen 42^4=30\u00b2=900 mod289. 289*3=867. 900-867=33 mod289. 33+1=34\u22600.\n\nNext n=59 (42+17). 59 mod17 is59-51=8 mod17. Compute 59^4 mod289.\n\n59^2=3481 mod289. Let's divide 3481 by289:\n\n289*12=3468. 3481-3468=13 mod289. So 59\u00b2\u226113 mod289.\n\nThen 59^4=13\u00b2=169 mod289. 169+1=170\u22600.\n\nNext n=76 (59+17). 76 mod17=76-68=8 mod17. Compute 76^4 mod289.\n\n76 mod289=76. 76\u00b2=5776 mod289. 289*20=5780. 5776-5780= -4 mod289. So 76\u00b2\u2261-4 mod289.\n\nThen 76^4=(-4)^2=16 mod289. 16+1=17\u22600 mod289.\n\nNext n=93 (76+17). 93 mod289 is93. We did this earlier. 93^4\u2261152 mod289. 152+1=153\u22600.\n\nNext n=110. Which works. So yes, 110 is the first one in this sequence. So 110 is indeed the minimal.\n\nWait, what about the other roots? For example, the n=15 mod17 gave n=134, but let's see if n=15 +17*7=134. If we check n=15 mod17 but with smaller k? Wait, the required k was7. So 15+17*7=134. If k=0, n=15, but 15^4 +1 mod289: 15^4\u226150 mod289, so 50+1=51\u22600. So no. Similarly, k=1: n=32. Let's see n=32 mod17 is15 mod17? 32-17=15 mod17. So n=32. Compute 32^4 mod289.\n\n32\u00b2=1024 mod289. 289*3=867, 1024-867=157 mod289. 32^4=157\u00b2 mod289. 157\u00b2=24649 mod289.\n\nCompute 289*85=24565. 24649-24565=84 mod289. So 32^4\u226184 mod289. 84+1=85\u22600. Not zero.\n\nSo no, only when k=7 does it work. So the minimal solution is indeed 110.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a solution from the n=9 mod17? For instance, the solution there was n=179, but maybe a smaller n?\n\nWait, let me check n=9+17*1=26. Let me compute 26 mod17=9 mod17. Compute 26^4 mod289.\n\n26\u00b2=676 mod289. 289*2=578, 676-578=98 mod289. 26^4=98\u00b2=9604 mod289.\n\nCompute 289*33=9537. 9604-9537=67 mod289. 67+1=68\u22600.\n\nn=43 (26+17). mod289=43. 43\u00b2=1849 mod289. 289*6=1734, 1849-1734=115 mod289. 43^4=115\u00b2=13225 mod289.\n\n289*45=13005. 13225-13005=220 mod289. 220+1=221\u22600.\n\nContinuing, n=60. 60 mod17 is 60-51=9 mod17. 60^4 mod289:\n\n60\u00b2=3600 mod289. 289*12=3468. 3600-3468=132 mod289. 60^4=132\u00b2=17424 mod289.\n\n289*60=17340. 17424-17340=84 mod289. 84+1=85\u22600.\n\nn=77: 77 mod17 is77-68=9 mod17. 77^2=5929 mod289. 289*20=5780, so 5929-5780=149 mod289. 77^4=149\u00b2=22201 mod289. 289*76=21944. 22201-21944=257 mod289. 257+1=258\u22600.\n\nn=94: 94 mod17 is94-85=9 mod17. 94^2=8836 mod289. 289*30=8670, so 8836-8670=166 mod289. 94^4=166\u00b2=27556 mod289. 289*95=27455. 27556-27455=101 mod289. 101+1=102\u22600.\n\nn=111 (9+17*6=111). Wait no, n=9+17*10=179. Anyway, this shows that the first solution for n=9 mod17 is at179, which is larger than110.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is110. But let me confirm once more that there's no smaller n than110. Let me check n= 110-17=93 which we did earlier, not a solution. n= 85? 85 mod17=0, so n=0 mod17. Then n^4+1 mod17 is1 mod17. Not 0.\n\nn= 68 mod17=0. Similarly no.\n\nn= 51 mod17=0. Nope.\n\nn= 34 mod17=0. No.\n\nn=17 mod17=0. No.\n\nHow about n= 102 mod17=102-85=17 mod17? No.\n\nWait, maybe check n= 10 mod17?\n\nWait, perhaps n= 110 is indeed the smallest. Let me see, since all smaller numbers either don't satisfy mod17 or when lifted don't hit mod289.\n\nThus, the minimal m is110. Wait, but wait a second, let me check n= 155. 155 mod289 is155, but 155 is larger than110. So 110 is the minimal. So the answer is m=110.\n\nWait, but let me check one more thing. The problem says \"the least positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by p\u00b2\". Since p is 17, so p\u00b2=289. So the minimal m is110. Therefore, the final answer should be 110?\n\nWait, but I have to confirm that there isn't a smaller m. Let me check n= 110 is indeed the smallest. Let me check n= 110 divided by17 is ~6.47, so the k was6. The minimal n is 110. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a solution with n less than17? For example, n=2, which gives 17, but not 289. n=8 gives 8^4 +1=4096+1=4097. Divided by289? 289*14=4046. 4097-4046=51, so remainder51. Not divisible.\n\nSimilarly n=9: 9^4+1=6561+1=6562. Divided by289: 289*22=6358. 6562-6358=204. 204 mod289\u22600.\n\nn=15:15^4+1=50625+1=50626. Divided by289: 289*175=50575, 50626-50575=51. Not divisible.\n\nn= 25: as before, gives 25^4 +1=390625 +1=390626. Divided by289:\n\n289*1350=289*(1300+50)=289*1300=375700, 289*50=14450 \u2192 total 375700+14450=390,150. 390,626-390,150=476. 476 mod289 is476-289=187. Not 0.\n\nThus, no smaller n works. So the minimal m is indeed110.\n\nWait, but let me check once more with n= 110. Let me compute 110^4 +1:\n\n110^4 = (110\u00b2)^2 = (12100)^2. But that's a big number. Alternatively, modulo289, we know it's -1 mod289, so 110^4 +1\u22610 mod289. So correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is m=110. Wait, but let me check the problem again:\n\n\"Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^{4}+1 is divisible by p^{2}. Find the least positive integer m such that m^{4}+1 is divisible by p^{2}.\"\n\nYes, so p is the smallest such prime, which we found to be17, and the minimal m is110. So the final answer is110.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Wait, when I started the problem, I thought the minimal prime is17. But is there a smaller prime that I missed?\n\nWait, let's think again. Earlier primes like 17 is the first prime \u22611 mod8. But maybe there are primes p where p\u00b2 divides n^4 +1 even when p\u2261 not 1 mod8? Wait, but for p divides n^4 +1, then n^4\u2261-1 modp, so -1 must be a quartic residue modp, which requires p\u22611 mod8. Because if p divides n^4 +1, then the order of n modp divides8, and since n^4\u2261-1, the order is8. Hence p\u22611 mod8. So primes p must be 1 mod8, so 17 is the smallest such prime. So p=17 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is m=110. Wait, but let me check an online source or calculation to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my calculation of the Hensel step for n=8 mod17 is correct?\n\nYes, the process was:\n\nFor n=8 mod17, we set n=8 +17k, then expand (8+17k)^4 +1 mod289. The first term is8^4=4096 mod289.\n\nWait, wait a second, earlier I computed 8^4 mod289 as50. Let me verify:\n\n8^2=64; 8^4=64^2=4096. Now divide 4096 by289:\n\n289*14=4046, so 4096-4046=50. So yes, 8^4\u226150 mod289. Then adding the second term 136k mod289. So 50+136k +1=51+136k. Set to 0 mod289:\n\n136k \u2261-51 mod289. Then dividing by gcd(136,289)=17:\n\n136=8*17; 51=3*17; 289=17\u00b2. So divide equation by17:\n\n8k \u2261-3 mod17 \u21d28k\u226114 mod17. Then inverse of8 mod17 is15, so k\u226114*15 mod17=210 mod17. 210 divided by17: 17*12=204, so 6 mod17. So k=6, leading to n=8+17*6=110. That is correct.\n\nThus, the answer should be 110. Wait, but I recall that in some references, the smallest n for 17\u00b2 is 5772, but perhaps I'm confusing with another problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in Hensel's lemma. Wait, Hensel's lemma says that if f(n\u2080)\u22610 modp and f\u2019(n\u2080) not\u22610 modp, then there is a unique lift modp\u00b2. So in this case, for n\u2080=2 mod17, f(n)=n^4+1, f\u2019(n)=4n\u00b3. At n=2, f\u2019(2)=32\u226115 mod17\u22600. So lift exists, and similarly for n=8, f\u2019(8)=4*(8)^3 mod17. 8^3 mod17 is (8 mod17)^3=512 mod17. 17*30=510, so 512\u22612 mod17. Thus, f\u2019(8)=4*2=8 mod17\u22600. So lifting is valid. So the computations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is110. So the final answer is 110.\n\nWait, but wait, hold on. Wait when I computed for n=8 mod17, the solution was n=110. But let me check n= 110 divided by17 is6.47, so 110=17\u00d76 +8. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the first step. Let me recompute the Hensel step for n=8 mod17.\n\nWe have f(n)=n^4 +1. Let n\u2080=8 mod17. We need to solve f(n\u2080 +17k)\u22610 mod17\u00b2.\n\nExpand f(n\u2080 +17k)= (n\u2080 +17k)^4 +1. Expanding:\n\n= n\u2080^4 +4n\u2080\u00b3(17k) +6n\u2080\u00b2(17k)^2 +4n\u2080(17k)^3 + (17k)^4 +1.\n\nModulo17\u00b2, terms with (17k)^2 or higher are 0 mod17\u00b2. So we have:\n\n\u2261 n\u2080^4 +4n\u2080\u00b3(17k) +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nSet this equal to0 mod17\u00b2:\n\nn\u2080^4 +4n\u2080\u00b3(17k) +1 \u22610 mod17\u00b2.\n\nBut n\u2080^4 \u2261-1 mod17, so n\u2080^4 = -1 +17m for some integer m. Therefore,\n\n(-1 +17m) +4n\u2080\u00b3(17k) +1 \u22610 mod17\u00b2 \u21d217m + 4n\u2080\u00b3*17k \u22610 mod17\u00b2 \u21d217*(m +4n\u2080\u00b3k)\u22610 mod17\u00b2 \u21d2m +4n\u2080\u00b3k \u22610 mod17.\n\nThus, solving for k: 4n\u2080\u00b3k \u2261-m mod17. But m=(n\u2080^4 +1)/17. Since n\u2080^4 \u2261-1 mod17, so n\u2080^4 +1\u22610 mod17, so m is an integer. Let me compute m for n\u2080=8:\n\nn\u2080=8: n\u2080^4 +1=4096 +1=4097. Divide by17: 4097/17=241. So m=241. Therefore,\n\n4*(8)^3 *k \u2261-241 mod17.\n\nCompute 8^3 mod17:8^2=64\u226113 mod17, 8^3=8*13=104\u2261104-85=19\u22612 mod17.\n\nThus, 4*2*k \u2261-241 mod17 \u21d28k\u2261-241 mod17.\n\nCompute -241 mod17: 17*14=238, so -241\u2261-241+238= -3 mod17\u226114 mod17.\n\nSo 8k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2k\u226114*(8^{-1}) mod17.\n\nThe inverse of8 mod17 is15, since8*15=120\u2261120-119=1 mod17.\n\nThus, k\u226114*15=210\u2261210-17*12=210-204=6 mod17. Which matches previous result. So k=6. So n\u2080 +17k=8+102=110. Correct.\n\nTherefore, calculations are correct. So the minimal m is110. Therefore, the answer is 110. But I feel like maybe I should confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal m is 5772? Wait, that seems too big. Wait, maybe I need to check an example.\n\nWait, according to some references, the smallest n where n^4 +1 is divisible by17\u00b2 is indeed 110. Let me see:\n\nCompute 110^4 +1:\n\n110^2 = 12100\n\n110^4 = (12100)^2 = 146,410,000\n\nAdd 1:146,410,001\n\nDivide by289:\n\nCompute 289 \u00d7 506,600 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute 146,410,001 /289:\n\nLet me see, 289 \u00d7 500,000 =144,500,000\n\nSubtract:146,410,001 -144,500,000 =1,910,001\n\nNow 289 \u00d76,600=289\u00d76000=1,734,000; 289\u00d7600=173,400 \u2192 total 1,734,000+173,400=1,907,400\n\nSubtract:1,910,001 -1,907,400=2,601\n\n289\u00d79=2,601. So total is500,000 +6,600 +9=506,609.\n\nThus, 289\u00d7506,609=146,410,001. Therefore, 110^4 +1 is indeed divisible by289. So correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 110. So I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{110}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest prime number p such that there's some positive integer n where p squared divides n^4 + 1. Then, once I find that prime p, I have to find the smallest positive integer m such that m^4 + 1 is divisible by p squared. Alright, let's start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, the problem is about primes and divisibility. Specifically, we're looking for primes p where p squared divides n^4 + 1 for some n. The question is asking for the smallest such prime p and then the smallest m for that p.\n\nHmm, primes where p squared divides n^4 + 1... So, n^4 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2. That congruence needs to hold. Since p is prime, maybe we can use some number theory here. Let me recall that if p is an odd prime, then the multiplicative group modulo p is cyclic of order p-1. So, for the equation x^4 \u2261 -1 mod p to have a solution, -1 must be a fourth power modulo p. That requires that -1 is in the subgroup generated by a primitive root. But to have x^4 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2, maybe similar conditions apply?\n\nWait, but first, let's think about primes for which -1 is a fourth power modulo p. Let me recall that for -1 to be a quadratic residue modulo p, p must be 1 mod 4. But for it to be a fourth power, perhaps more restrictive conditions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's easier to look for primes p where p\u00b2 divides n^4 +1. Let me think of small primes first and see if any of them satisfy this condition. Since the question is asking for the least prime p, maybe p is not too big. Let me check primes one by one starting from the smallest primes.\n\nStarting with p=2: Let's see if 2\u00b2 divides n^4 +1. So 4 divides n^4 +1. Let's check possible n mod 4. n can be 0,1,2,3 mod 4.\n\nn=0 mod4: n^4=0 mod4, so n^4+1=1 mod4. Not divisible by 4.\n\nn=1 mod4: 1+1=2 mod4. Not divisible by 4.\n\nn=2 mod4: 16 mod4 is 0, so 0+1=1 mod4. Not divisible.\n\nn=3 mod4: 81 mod4 is 1, so again 1+1=2 mod4. Not divisible. So 4 can't divide n^4+1. Therefore p=2 is out.\n\nNext prime p=3: Check if 3\u00b2=9 divides n^4 +1. Let's see possible n mod9. Wait, maybe first check modulo 3 first. Let's see if n^4 \u2261 -1 mod3. Since mod3, n can be 0,1,2.\n\nn=0: 0 +1=1 mod3\u2260-1.\n\nn=1: 1+1=2\u2261-1 mod3. Wait, actually n=1 mod3 gives 1^4=1 mod3, so 1+1=2\u2261-1 mod3. So n^4 \u2261 -1 mod3 is possible. But we need mod9. Let's check n=1 mod3. Let's see n=1: 1+1=2 mod9, not divisible by 9. n=4: 4^4 is 256 mod9. Let's compute 4^4: 4^2=16\u22617 mod9, then 7^2=49\u22614 mod9. So 4^4 +1=4+1=5 mod9. Not 0.\n\nn=7 mod9? Let's try n=7: 7 mod9. 7^4: 7^2=49\u22614 mod9, then 4^2=16\u22617 mod9. So 7^4 +1=7+1=8 mod9. Still not 0. How about n=2 mod3? Let's try n=2. 2^4=16\u22617 mod9, so 7+1=8 mod9. Not 0. Hmm, maybe n=5? Let's see n=5 mod9: 5^4. 5^2=25\u22617 mod9, then squared is 49\u22614 mod9, so 4+1=5 mod9. Not 0. Hmm. So maybe 3\u00b2 can't divide n^4+1. So p=3 is out.\n\nNext prime p=5. Let's check if 25 divides n^4 +1. Let me check possible n mod5 first. Since n^4 mod5: By Fermat's little theorem, n^4 \u22611 mod5 when n not divisible by 5. So n^4 +1 \u22612 mod5. So if n is not divisible by 5, n^4 +1 \u22612 mod5. If n is divisible by 5, then n^4 is 0 mod5, so n^4 +1 \u22611 mod5. So in no case is n^4 +1 divisible by 5, let alone 25. Therefore p=5 is out.\n\nNext prime p=7. Let's see. Check if 49 divides n^4 +1. Again, first check modulo7. Let's compute n^4 mod7. Since 7 is prime, and 4 divides 6 (the order of the multiplicative group), so the fourth powers mod7. Let's compute n^4 mod7 for n=1 to 6:\n\n1^4=1 mod7\n\n2^4=16\u22612 mod7\n\n3^4=81\u22614 mod7 (since 3^2=9\u22612, so squared again is 4 mod7)\n\n4^4: same as (4 mod7)^4. 4 mod7 is 4, so 4^2=16\u22612 mod7, so squared again is 4 mod7. So 4^4\u22614 mod7.\n\n5^4: 5 mod7 is -2, so (-2)^4=16\u22612 mod7.\n\n6^4: 6 mod7 is -1, so (-1)^4=1 mod7.\n\nSo the possible fourth powers mod7 are 1,2,4. So n^4 +1 mod7 can be 2,3,5. None of these are 0 mod7. Therefore n^4 +1 is never divisible by 7, so p=7 is out.\n\nMoving on to p=11? Wait, let's check p=13 first? Wait, maybe check p=17? Hmm, perhaps I should go in order.\n\nWait, next prime after 7 is 11. Let's check p=11. Let me see if 121 divides n^4 +1.\n\nFirst, check mod11. Let's see n^4 mod11. Since 11 is prime, the multiplicative order is 10. 4 divides 10? 10 divided by gcd(4,10)=2, so the order of the subgroup is 5? Wait, maybe better to compute n^4 mod11 for n from 1 to 10.\n\n1^4=1 mod11\n\n2^4=16\u22615 mod11\n\n3^4=81\u22614 mod11 (since 3^2=9, squared again is 81 mod11=4)\n\n4^4=256 mod11. 256 divided by 11: 11*23=253, so 256-253=3 mod11. So 3.\n\n5^4: 5^2=25\u22613 mod11, so squared again 3^2=9 mod11. So 9.\n\n6^4: 6^2=36\u22613 mod11, squared again 9 mod11.\n\n7^4: 7 mod11 is -4, so (-4)^4=256\u22613 mod11 (same as 4^4).\n\n8^4: 8 mod11 is -3, so (-3)^4=81\u22614 mod11 (same as 3^4).\n\n9^4: 9 mod11 is -2, so (-2)^4=16\u22615 mod11 (same as 2^4).\n\n10^4: 10 mod11 is -1, so (-1)^4=1 mod11 (same as 1^4).\n\nSo the fourth powers mod11 are 1,3,4,5,9. Thus, n^4 +1 mod11 can be 2,4,5,6,10. None of which are 0 mod11. So 11 is out.\n\nHmm, moving on to p=13. Let's check p=13.\n\nFirst check mod13. Let me compute n^4 mod13.\n\n1^4=1 mod13.\n\n2^4=16\u22613 mod13.\n\n3^4=81\u226181-65=16? Wait, 13*6=78, so 81-78=3 mod13. Wait, no: 3^4=81. 13*6=78, so 81-78=3. So 3 mod13.\n\nWait, that can't be. Wait 3^2=9, so 3^4=81 mod13. Let's compute 13*6=78, so 81-78=3. So yes, 3 mod13.\n\n4^4: 4^2=16\u22613 mod13, then squared again: 3^2=9 mod13. So 9 mod13.\n\n5^4: 5^2=25\u226112 mod13, so squared again: 12^2=144 mod13. 13*11=143, so 144-143=1 mod13. So 1 mod13.\n\n6^4: 6^2=36\u226110 mod13, so squared again: 10^2=100 mod13. 13*7=91, so 100-91=9 mod13.\n\n7^4: 7^2=49\u226110 mod13 (since 13*3=39, 49-39=10), then squared again: 10^2=100\u22619 mod13.\n\n8^4: 8 mod13 is -5, so (-5)^4=625 mod13. Let's compute 13*48=624, so 625\u22611 mod13. So 1 mod13.\n\n9^4: 9 mod13 is -4, so (-4)^4=256 mod13. 256 divided by 13: 13*19=247, so 256-247=9 mod13.\n\n10^4: 10 mod13 is -3, so (-3)^4=81\u22613 mod13 (as before).\n\n11^4: 11 mod13 is -2, so (-2)^4=16\u22613 mod13.\n\n12^4: 12 mod13 is -1, so (-1)^4=1 mod13.\n\nSo the fourth powers mod13 are 1, 3, 9. Thus, n^4 +1 mod13 can be 2,4,10. None of these are 0 mod13. So p=13 is out.\n\nHmm, this is tedious. Maybe there's a better way. Let me think. The problem requires that p\u00b2 divides n\u2074 +1. So, in particular, n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p\u00b2. For such a congruence to hold, first, n\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p must hold. So first, we can narrow down primes p where -1 is a quartic residue mod p. \n\nThe necessary condition for -1 being a quartic residue mod p is that p \u22611 mod 8. Because, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. To have a fourth root of -1, the equation x\u2074 = -1 mod p must have solutions. Since -1 is a square only if p\u22611 mod 4. For it to be a fourth power, the exponent 4 must divide the order of the multiplicative group divided by 2 (since -1 is a square). Wait, perhaps better to recall that the quartic residues mod p require that 8 divides the order of the group? Wait, let me think again.\n\nLet me recall that in the multiplicative group mod p (which is cyclic of order p-1), the equation x^4 = -1 has a solution if and only if the order of -1 in the group divides (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Wait, maybe it's better to note that -1 must be an element of order dividing 2, so for x^4 = -1, we need that (-1)^2 =1, so the order of x must be 8? Hmm, perhaps this is getting too tangled. Let me recall a theorem: \n\nThe equation x\u2074 \u2261 -1 mod p has solutions if and only if p \u2261 1 mod 8. Because, the multiplicative group mod p is cyclic of order p-1. For the equation x\u2074 = -1 to have a solution, the order of -1 in the group must divide (p-1)/gcd(4, p-1). Alternatively, since -1 is an element of order 2, so to have x^4 = -1, then the order of x must be 8, so 8 divides the order of the group (p-1). Therefore, p \u22611 mod 8. So primes p \u22611 mod8 are candidates.\n\nTherefore, primes p \u22611 mod8. The smallest such primes are 17, 41, 73, 89, 97, etc. So starting from the smallest, 17.\n\nSo maybe p=17 is the first candidate. Let me check if 17 squared divides n^4 +1 for some n. Let me first check mod17 to see if there exists n with n^4 \u2261-1 mod17.\n\nSince 17\u22611 mod8, so it should have solutions. Let me compute n^4 mod17. Let's see, let's try some numbers:\n\nLet me try n=4: 4^4 =256. 256 mod17: 17*15=255, so 256 mod17 is 1. So 1 mod17. Not -1.\n\nn=2: 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Oh! Wait, 2^4 is 16, which is -1 mod17. So 2^4 \u2261 -1 mod17. So n=2 works mod17. So that's good. So 2^4 +1 is divisible by 17. But we need divisibility by 17\u00b2. So check if 2^4 +1 is divisible by 17\u00b2. 2^4 +1 =16 +1=17. Which is 17, so only divisible by 17 once, not 17\u00b2. So n=2 won't work for p=17.\n\nTherefore, need to find an n such that n^4 \u2261-1 mod17\u00b2. So need to lift the solution from mod17 to mod17\u00b2. Maybe using Hensel's lemma?\n\nHensel's lemma says that if f(n) \u22610 mod p and f'(n) not \u22610 mod p, then there's a unique lift mod p\u00b2. Let me see.\n\nLet f(n)=n\u2074 +1. We have f(2)=17 mod17\u00b2. So f(2)\u22610 mod17, but mod17\u00b2 it's 17. The derivative f\u2019(n)=4n\u00b3. At n=2, f\u2019(2)=4*(8)=32\u226132-17=15 mod17. Which is not 0 mod17. Therefore, by Hensel's lemma, there is a unique solution mod17\u00b2 congruent to 2 mod17. So we can find n=2 +17k such that (2+17k)^4 +1 \u22610 mod17\u00b2.\n\nLet me compute (2 +17k)^4 mod17\u00b2. Let me expand this using the binomial theorem:\n\n(2 +17k)^4 = 2^4 + 4*2^3*(17k) + 6*2^2*(17k)^2 + 4*2*(17k)^3 + (17k)^4\n\nBut since we are working mod17\u00b2, terms with 17\u00b2 or higher can be ignored except for the first two terms. Wait:\n\nLet me compute each term modulo17\u00b2:\n\nFirst term: 2^4=16.\n\nSecond term: 4*(8)*(17k)=32*17k. 32 mod17 is 32-17=15, so 15*17k mod17\u00b2 is 15*17k.\n\nThird term: 6*(4)*(17k)^2. Since (17k)^2 is 289k\u00b2, which is 0 mod17\u00b2. So the third term is 24*(289k\u00b2) which is 0 mod17\u00b2. Similarly, the fourth term has (17k)^3, which is 0 mod17\u00b2, and the last term is (17k)^4 mod17\u00b2 which is 0. So overall, modulo17\u00b2, the expansion is:\n\n16 + 15*17k mod17\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, setting this equal to -1 mod17\u00b2:\n\n16 +15*17k \u2261 -1 mod17\u00b2\n\nSo 16 +15*17k +1 \u22610 mod17\u00b2\n\n17 + 15*17k \u22610 mod17\u00b2\n\nFactor out 17:\n\n17*(1 +15k) \u22610 mod17\u00b2\n\nTherefore, 1 +15k \u22610 mod17\n\nSo 15k \u2261 -1 mod17\n\nMultiply both sides by the inverse of 15 mod17. 15 and 17 are coprime, so inverse exists. Let me find 15^{-1} mod17.\n\n15x \u22611 mod17. Trying x= 15*? Let's see 15*15=225. 225 mod17: 17*13=221, so 225-221=4. Not 1. 15* 8=120. 120 mod17: 17*7=119, so 1. So 15*8=120\u22611 mod17. Wait 15*8=120. 120 divided by17: 17*7=119, so 120-119=1. Yes. So inverse is 8. So multiply both sides by8:\n\nk\u2261 -1*8 mod17 \u21d2 k\u2261 -8 mod17 \u21d2 k\u22619 mod17.\n\nSo k=9 mod17. The smallest positive k is 9. Therefore, n=2 +17*9 mod17\u00b2.\n\nCompute 17*9=153. So n=2+153=155. Thus, n=155 mod17\u00b2. Let me check if 155^4 +1 is divisible by 17\u00b2.\n\nBut let's verify the calculation. Let's compute (2 +17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2 where k=9:\n\nWe had the expansion gives 16 +15*17*9 mod17\u00b2. 15*9=135. 135 mod17? Wait, but we already know the equation reduces to 17*(1 +15k)=0 mod17\u00b2, so with k=9, 1+15*9=1+135=136. 136 mod17 is 136 divided by17: 17*8=136, so 136 mod17 is 0. So 17*0=0 mod17\u00b2. Therefore, it works. So n=155 is a solution mod17\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, 155^4 +1 is divisible by 17\u00b2. Therefore, p=17 is a prime where such an n exists. Is there a smaller prime?\n\nWait, before confirming that 17 is the smallest prime, let me check primes between 7 and 17. Wait, after 7 came 11,13, which we checked. Then 17 is next. So 17 is the first prime \u22611 mod8. So yes, 17 is the smallest prime where such an n exists.\n\nSo the first part answer is p=17, then we have to find the minimal m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by17\u00b2. The minimal positive integer m would be the minimal solution mod17\u00b2, which we found as 155, but maybe there is a smaller m?\n\nWait, when we applied Hensel's lemma, we started from n=2 mod17. The solution mod17\u00b2 is 2 +17k where k\u22619 mod17. So the minimal positive solution is 2 +17*9=155. But perhaps there is a smaller n?\n\nWait, let me see. Let me try n=2 +17k where k=0 gives n=2, which gives 17, not 17\u00b2. k=1 gives n=19. Let's compute 19^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nCompute 19 mod17 is 2, so 19 \u22612 mod17. So 19^4 \u22612^4=16 mod17\u00b2? Wait, but 19 is 2 +17*1. Let's compute (2 +17)^4 mod17\u00b2.\n\nUsing the same expansion as before:\n\n(2 +17)^4 = 16 +15*17*1 mod17\u00b2. So 16 +15*17=16 +255=271. 271 mod17\u00b2 (289). 271 is less than 289, so 271. 271 +1=272. So 272 mod289 is 272, so not 0 mod289. So k=1 doesn't work.\n\nk=2: n=2+17*2=36. Let's see (2 +34)^4 mod17\u00b2. Let me compute:\n\n(2 +34)^4. Again, binomial expansion mod17\u00b2.\n\nWait, but 34 is 2*17, so let me compute (2 + 2*17)^4:\n\nFirst term: 2^4=16\n\nSecond term: 4*(2^3)*(2*17)=4*8*34= 4*8*2*17= 64*17= 1088 mod17\u00b2.\n\nWait, maybe better to use the previous approach:\n\nLet me use the formula (2 +17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2. Let me compute for k=2:\n\nThe expansion gives 16 +15*17k mod17\u00b2. So with k=2, that's 16 +15*34=16 + 510=526 mod289. Let's compute 526 mod289: 289*1=289, 526-289=237. 237 mod289. So 526 mod289=237. Then adding 1 (from the +1 in the original equation?), wait, no, actually, the expansion was (2 +17k)^4 = 16 +15*17k mod17\u00b2, so adding 1 gives 17 +15*17k mod17\u00b2. Wait, hold on:\n\nWait in the previous calculation, we had (2+17k)^4 +1 = [16 +15*17k] +1 =17 +15*17k mod17\u00b2. So setting this equal to 0 mod17\u00b2:\n\n17*(1 +15k) \u22610 mod17\u00b2 \u21d21 +15k\u22610 mod17. So for k=2, 1+15*2=31\u226131-34= -3 mod17\u226114 mod17\u22600. So indeed, not 0.\n\nSo for k=9, 1+15*9=1+135=136\u22610 mod17. So that works. So the minimal positive k is 9, leading to n=2+17*9=155. So 155 is the minimal n mod17\u00b2. But maybe there is a smaller n?\n\nWait, perhaps there is another solution from another initial solution mod17. Because in mod17, the equation x^4\u2261-1 mod17 had solutions. Let's see, 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Also, since the multiplicative group is cyclic of order 16 (since 17 is prime, so group order 16), then the solutions to x^4\u2261-1 would be the elements of order 8, perhaps?\n\nWait, in the multiplicative group mod17, the elements of order 8 satisfy x^8\u22611 mod17, but x^4\u2261-1 mod17. So the solutions to x^4\u2261-1 mod17 are the elements of order 8. Since the group is cyclic of order 16, the number of elements of order 8 is \u03c6(8)=4. Therefore, there are four solutions mod17. So besides 2, there might be others.\n\nLet me find all solutions to x^4\u2261-1 mod17.\n\nWe know that 2^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Let me check other numbers:\n\nLet me try 4: 4^4=256\u2261256-15*17=256-255=1 mod17. Not -1.\n\n5: 5^4 mod17. 5^2=25\u22618 mod17, so squared again: 8^2=64\u226113 mod17. Not -1.\n\nWait 3: 3^4=81 mod17. 17*4=68, so 81-68=13 mod17. Not -1.\n\nHow about 8? 8^4. 8 mod17 is 8. 8^2=64\u226113 mod17. 13^2=169\u226116 mod17. So 8^4\u226116\u2261-1 mod17. So 8 is another solution.\n\nSimilarly, 15 mod17 is -2, so (-2)^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. So 15 is another solution. Similarly, let's see 15's counterpart?\n\nWait 8, 2, 15, and maybe another?\n\nWait 16 mod17 is -1, so (-1)^4=1 mod17. Not -1.\n\nWait let's see 9 mod17. 9^2=81\u226113 mod17. Then squared again 13^2=169\u226116 mod17. So 9^4\u226116\u2261-1 mod17. Wait 9?\n\nWait 9^4: 9^2=81\u226113 mod17, then squared: 13^2=169\u226116 mod17. So yes. So 9 is another solution. Similarly, 8, 9, 2, 15?\n\nWait, let me check 10: 10^2=100\u226115 mod17, then squared: 15^2=225\u22614 mod17. So 10^4\u22614 mod17. Not -1.\n\nHmm. So the solutions mod17 are 2, 8, 9, 15? Let's check 15: 15^4. 15\u2261-2 mod17, so (-2)^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. Correct. 8^4=16, 9^4= (9)^2 squared: 9^2=81\u226113, so 13^2=169\u226116 mod17. Yes. So the four solutions mod17 are 2, 8, 9, 15.\n\nTherefore, each of these four solutions mod17 can be lifted to mod17\u00b2 via Hensel's lemma. So perhaps there are four solutions mod17\u00b2. Each of the four initial roots can be lifted. So maybe there is a smaller m than 155?\n\nLet's check starting with n=8 mod17. Let's try lifting n=8 mod17.\n\nLet me do the same process for n=8 mod17. Let me set n=8 +17k. Then compute (8+17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nAgain using binomial expansion:\n\n(8 +17k)^4 =8^4 +4*8^3*(17k) + ... higher terms mod17\u00b2.\n\nFirst term:8^4 mod17\u00b2. Let's compute 8^4: 8^2=64, 8^4=64^2=4096. 4096 mod17\u00b2 (289):\n\nCompute 289*14=4046. 4096 -4046=50. So 8^4\u226150 mod289.\n\nWait, but mod17, 8^4\u2261-1 mod17. Let's confirm 50 mod17: 17*2=34, 50-34=16\u2261-1 mod17. So that's correct.\n\nThen the second term:4*(8^3)*(17k). Let's compute 8^3=512. 512 mod17: 17*30=510, so 512\u22612 mod17. So 8^3\u22612 mod17. Therefore, 4*8^3=4*2=8 mod17. Thus, the second term is 8*(17k)* mod17\u00b2. But more precisely, let's compute the coefficient mod17\u00b2.\n\nWait, let's do it step by step. The second term is 4*(8)^3*(17k). 8^3=512. 512*4=2048. Multiply by17k: 2048*17k. But mod17\u00b2, 17k is a factor, so 2048 mod17. Let's compute 2048 mod17:\n\n17*120=2040, so 2048-2040=8 mod17. So 2048\u22618 mod17. Therefore, the second term is 8*17k mod17\u00b2. So 136k mod17\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the total expansion mod17\u00b2:\n\nFirst term:50 mod289.\n\nSecond term:136k mod289.\n\nThird terms are multiples of (17)^2, so 0 mod17\u00b2.\n\nSo total expression: (8+17k)^4 +1 \u226150 +136k +1 mod289 =51 +136k mod289.\n\nSet this equal to 0 mod289:\n\n51 +136k \u22610 mod289 \u21d2136k \u2261-51 mod289.\n\nDivide both sides by gcd(136,289). Let's compute gcd(136,289). 289 is 17\u00b2, 136 is 17*8. So gcd is17.\n\nThus, divide equation by17: 8k \u2261-3 mod17 (since 51/17=3, 136/17=8, 289/17=17).\n\nSo 8k \u2261-3 mod17 \u21d28k \u226114 mod17.\n\nMultiply both sides by inverse of8 mod17. 8 and17 are coprime. 8*?\u22611 mod17. 8*2=16\u2261-1 mod17. So 8*(-2)=1 mod17 \u21d2 inverse is -2\u226115 mod17.\n\nThus, k\u226114*15 mod17.\n\n14*15=210 mod17: 17*12=204, so 210-204=6 mod17. So k\u22616 mod17.\n\nThus, the minimal k is6, so n=8 +17*6=8+102=110.\n\nCheck if 110 is smaller than 155. Yes, 110 is smaller. Let me verify n=110:\n\nCompute 110 mod17 is 110-17*6=110-102=8 mod17, which is correct. Let's compute (110)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nBut using the previous calculation, when k=6, the expression is 51+136*6=51+816=867 mod289. 867 divided by289: 289*3=867. So 867\u22610 mod289. So yes, it works. Thus, n=110 is a solution mod17\u00b2. So that's smaller than 155. Hmm, so maybe 110 is smaller?\n\nSimilarly, let's check the other roots. Let me try n=9 mod17. Let me do the same process for n=9 mod17.\n\nLet n=9 +17k. Compute (9 +17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nFirst term:9^4 mod289. Compute 9^4= (9^2)^2=81^2=6561. 6561 divided by289: 289*22=6358, 6561-6358=203 mod289.\n\nCheck mod17: 203 mod17: 17*11=187, 203-187=16\u2261-1 mod17. Correct.\n\nSecond term:4*(9)^3*(17k). Compute 9^3=729 mod289. Wait, but mod17: 9^3 mod17. 9 mod17 is9, 9^2=81\u226113 mod17, so 9^3=9*13=117\u2261117-102=15 mod17. Therefore, 9^3\u226115 mod17. Then 4*15=60 mod17. 60 mod17: 17*3=51, 60-51=9 mod17. So 4*9^3 \u22619 mod17. Then multiplied by17k gives 9*17k mod17\u00b2. Thus the second term is 153k mod289.\n\nSo total expression mod289: first term 203 + second term153k +1. So total is 204 +153k mod289.\n\nSet to 0 mod289:\n\n204 +153k \u22610 mod289 \u21d2153k \u2261-204 mod289.\n\nAgain, gcd(153,289). 153=9*17, 289=17\u00b2. So gcd is17. Divide by17:\n\n9k \u2261-12 mod17 (since 204/17=12, 153/17=9, 289/17=17)\n\nSo 9k \u22615 mod17 (since -12 mod17 is 5).\n\nFind inverse of9 mod17. 9*2=18\u22611 mod17. So inverse is2.\n\nThus, k\u22615*2=10 mod17.\n\nThus, k=10 mod17. The minimal k is10, so n=9 +17*10=9+170=179. Hmm, 179 is bigger than 110, so not better.\n\nNow check n=15 mod17. Let me see. Let me take n=15 mod17. Let n=15+17k.\n\nCompute (15 +17k)^4 +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nFirst term:15^4 mod289. 15 is -2 mod17, so 15^4=(-2)^4=16 mod17, but mod289:\n\nCompute 15^2=225, 15^4=225\u00b2=50625. Let's divide 50625 by289.\n\n289*175=289*(170+5)=289*170=49130 +289*5=1445 \u2192 total 49130+1445=50575. 50625-50575=50 mod289. So 15^4\u226150 mod289.\n\nWait, but 15 mod17 is -2, so 15^4\u2261(-2)^4=16\u2261-1 mod17. 50 mod17 is 50-51= -1, yes. So first term is50.\n\nSecond term:4*(15)^3*(17k). 15^3 mod17: (-2)^3= -8 mod17. So 4*(-8)= -32\u2261-32+51=19 mod17? Wait better to compute mod17 first.\n\n15^3 mod17 is (-2)^3= -8 mod17. So 4*(-8)= -32 mod17. -32 mod17: 17*2=34, so -32= -32 +34=2 mod17. So 4*15^3\u22612 mod17. Then multiplied by17k gives 2*17k mod289. So second term is34k mod289.\n\nThus total expression mod289:\n\n50 +34k +1=51 +34k mod289.\n\nSet to 0: 51 +34k\u22610 mod289 \u21d234k\u2261-51 mod289.\n\nDivide by gcd(34,289). 34=2*17, 289=17\u00b2, so gcd=17. Divide equation by17: 2k \u2261-3 mod17 \u21d22k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2k\u22617 mod17 (since 2*7=14). So k=7 mod17. The minimal k is7, so n=15 +17*7=15+119=134. Check if 134 is smaller than 110? 134>110, so no.\n\nSo the minimal m so far is 110 from the n=8 case. Let me see if there's a smaller one.\n\nWait, let's check n=8+17*6=110. Is there a smaller k? Since k must be congruent to6 mod17, the minimal positive k is6, so 110 is the minimal for that root.\n\nSimilarly, the other roots gave 155,179,134, which are larger. So the minimal m is110?\n\nWait, but let me check another possibility. The solutions mod17 can be lifted, but perhaps there's a solution less than 110?\n\nWait, the minimal positive solution would be the minimal among all the lifted solutions. Since 110 is the smallest so far, let's see if there is a smaller n.\n\nWait, let's check n=110. Let me compute 110^4 +1 divided by 289. Let me compute 110 mod289 is110. Let's compute 110^4 mod289.\n\nAlternatively, since we already did the calculation with k=6, and found that 51+136*6=51+816=867=3*289=867, so 867 mod289 is0. So yes, correct.\n\nBut maybe there is a smaller n?\n\nWait, maybe n=17\u00b2 - something? Let me see, 17\u00b2 is289, so numbers less than 289. The solutions mod289 would be 110,155,134,179, etc., but perhaps even smaller?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps n= 110-289= negative, so no. The minimal positive solution is 110. Wait, but let me check n= 110-17*17=110-289= negative. So no.\n\nWait, but maybe when lifting from n=2 mod17, the solution was n=155, but maybe there's a negative k? For example, if k=9-17= -8, then n=2+17*(-8)=2-136= -134 mod289. Which is 289-134=155. Wait, no. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made an error in the calculation for n=8 mod17?\n\nWait let me check n=110. Let me compute 110^4 +1 divided by 289.\n\nFirst compute 110^2: 110*110=12100. 12100 mod289. Let me divide 12100 by289:\n\n289*41=289*40 +289=11560+289=11849. 12100-11849=251. So 110\u00b2\u2261251 mod289.\n\nThen 251\u00b2 mod289. Compute 251^2:\n\n251^2 = (250+1)^2 = 62500 + 500 +1=63001. Wait that's too big. Alternatively, compute 251 mod289 is251.\n\n251^2 mod289:\n\nLet me compute 251 mod289 is251.\n\nCompute 251^2: 251*251.\n\nLet me compute step by step:\n\n251 *251:\n\nFirst 200*200=40,000\n\n200*51=10,200\n\n51*200=10,200\n\n51*51=2,601\n\nAdding up: 40,000 + 10,200 +10,200 +2,600= 63,000? Wait no, perhaps better:\n\nWait actually, 251*251 = (250+1)^2 = 250\u00b2 + 2*250*1 +1\u00b2 =62,500 +500 +1=63,001.\n\nNow divide 63,001 by289:\n\n289*218=289*(200+18)=289*200=57,800; 289*18=5,202 \u2192 total 57,800 +5,202=63,002. Hmm, 289*218=63,002. But 63,001 is one less, so 63,001 mod289= -1 mod289. Therefore, (110)^4 \u2261251\u00b2 \u2261-1 mod289. Thus, 110^4 +1 \u22610 mod289. Correct.\n\nTherefore, 110 is indeed a solution. Now, is there a smaller n?\n\nWait let's check n= 110-17=93. Let's see if 93 works. Let me compute 93^4 +1 mod289.\n\nFirst compute 93 mod17: 93 divided by17: 17*5=85, so 93-85=8 mod17. So 93\u22618 mod17. So similar to n=8 mod17. So perhaps 93 is another solution? Wait but when k=6, n=8+17*6=110. If k= -11 mod17 (since k\u22616 mod17, so k=6-17= -11). Then n=8 +17*(-11)=8-187= -179 mod289. Which is 289-179=110. Wait, so negative k would give larger numbers?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another solution with smaller n?\n\nWait let me check n= 155-289= negative. Not useful.\n\nWait let me check n= 110 is the minimal positive solution. Let me check n= 110-289 is negative. So the minimal positive is 110.\n\nWait but let me check another root. Let me try n= 2 mod17, but with k=9, giving n=155, which is bigger. The next possible solution from n=8 mod17 would be n=110-17=93, but that's less than 110 but would that be a solution? Let me check n=93 mod17 is8 mod17. Let me compute (93)^4 +1 mod289.\n\nCompute 93 mod289 is93. Let me compute 93^2 first: 93\u00b2=8649. 8649 divided by289:\n\n289*30=8670, so 8649-8670= -21 mod289. So 93\u00b2\u2261-21 mod289.\n\nThen 93^4 = (93\u00b2)^2 \u2261 (-21)^2=441 mod289. 441-289=152 mod289. So 93^4\u2261152 mod289. Then 152+1=153 mod289\u22600. So no, 93 is not a solution. So my mistake, just being mod17 isn't enough. The lifting requires the specific k.\n\nThus, the minimal solution is indeed 110. Wait, but let me check another way. Let me see if there is a smaller n than 110 where n^4 +1 is divisible by17\u00b2.\n\nLet me check n= 8 mod17, so n=8,25,42,... up to 110. Let's try n=8+17*1=25. Let me compute 25^4 +1 mod289.\n\n25 mod17 is8, so 25\u22618 mod17. Compute 25^4 mod289.\n\n25^2=625 mod289. 289*2=578, so 625-578=47 mod289. So 25\u00b2\u226147 mod289.\n\nThen 25^4=47\u00b2=2209 mod289. 289*7=2023. 2209-2023=186 mod289. So 25^4\u2261186 mod289. 186+1=187 mod289\u22600. So no.\n\nNext n=25+17=42. 42 mod17 is42-34=8 mod17. Compute 42^4 mod289.\n\n42 mod289=42. 42\u00b2=1764 mod289. 289*6=1734, 1764-1734=30 mod289. So 42\u00b2\u226130 mod289.\n\nThen 42^4=30\u00b2=900 mod289. 289*3=867. 900-867=33 mod289. 33+1=34\u22600.\n\nNext n=59 (42+17). 59 mod17 is59-51=8 mod17. Compute 59^4 mod289.\n\n59^2=3481 mod289. Let's divide 3481 by289:\n\n289*12=3468. 3481-3468=13 mod289. So 59\u00b2\u226113 mod289.\n\nThen 59^4=13\u00b2=169 mod289. 169+1=170\u22600.\n\nNext n=76 (59+17). 76 mod17=76-68=8 mod17. Compute 76^4 mod289.\n\n76 mod289=76. 76\u00b2=5776 mod289. 289*20=5780. 5776-5780= -4 mod289. So 76\u00b2\u2261-4 mod289.\n\nThen 76^4=(-4)^2=16 mod289. 16+1=17\u22600 mod289.\n\nNext n=93 (76+17). 93 mod289 is93. We did this earlier. 93^4\u2261152 mod289. 152+1=153\u22600.\n\nNext n=110. Which works. So yes, 110 is the first one in this sequence. So 110 is indeed the minimal.\n\nWait, what about the other roots? For example, the n=15 mod17 gave n=134, but let's see if n=15 +17*7=134. If we check n=15 mod17 but with smaller k? Wait, the required k was7. So 15+17*7=134. If k=0, n=15, but 15^4 +1 mod289: 15^4\u226150 mod289, so 50+1=51\u22600. So no. Similarly, k=1: n=32. Let's see n=32 mod17 is15 mod17? 32-17=15 mod17. So n=32. Compute 32^4 mod289.\n\n32\u00b2=1024 mod289. 289*3=867, 1024-867=157 mod289. 32^4=157\u00b2 mod289. 157\u00b2=24649 mod289.\n\nCompute 289*85=24565. 24649-24565=84 mod289. So 32^4\u226184 mod289. 84+1=85\u22600. Not zero.\n\nSo no, only when k=7 does it work. So the minimal solution is indeed 110.\n\nWait, but let me check if there's a solution from the n=9 mod17? For instance, the solution there was n=179, but maybe a smaller n?\n\nWait, let me check n=9+17*1=26. Let me compute 26 mod17=9 mod17. Compute 26^4 mod289.\n\n26\u00b2=676 mod289. 289*2=578, 676-578=98 mod289. 26^4=98\u00b2=9604 mod289.\n\nCompute 289*33=9537. 9604-9537=67 mod289. 67+1=68\u22600.\n\nn=43 (26+17). mod289=43. 43\u00b2=1849 mod289. 289*6=1734, 1849-1734=115 mod289. 43^4=115\u00b2=13225 mod289.\n\n289*45=13005. 13225-13005=220 mod289. 220+1=221\u22600.\n\nContinuing, n=60. 60 mod17 is 60-51=9 mod17. 60^4 mod289:\n\n60\u00b2=3600 mod289. 289*12=3468. 3600-3468=132 mod289. 60^4=132\u00b2=17424 mod289.\n\n289*60=17340. 17424-17340=84 mod289. 84+1=85\u22600.\n\nn=77: 77 mod17 is77-68=9 mod17. 77^2=5929 mod289. 289*20=5780, so 5929-5780=149 mod289. 77^4=149\u00b2=22201 mod289. 289*76=21944. 22201-21944=257 mod289. 257+1=258\u22600.\n\nn=94: 94 mod17 is94-85=9 mod17. 94^2=8836 mod289. 289*30=8670, so 8836-8670=166 mod289. 94^4=166\u00b2=27556 mod289. 289*95=27455. 27556-27455=101 mod289. 101+1=102\u22600.\n\nn=111 (9+17*6=111). Wait no, n=9+17*10=179. Anyway, this shows that the first solution for n=9 mod17 is at179, which is larger than110.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is110. But let me confirm once more that there's no smaller n than110. Let me check n= 110-17=93 which we did earlier, not a solution. n= 85? 85 mod17=0, so n=0 mod17. Then n^4+1 mod17 is1 mod17. Not 0.\n\nn= 68 mod17=0. Similarly no.\n\nn= 51 mod17=0. Nope.\n\nn= 34 mod17=0. No.\n\nn=17 mod17=0. No.\n\nHow about n= 102 mod17=102-85=17 mod17? No.\n\nWait, maybe check n= 10 mod17?\n\nWait, perhaps n= 110 is indeed the smallest. Let me see, since all smaller numbers either don't satisfy mod17 or when lifted don't hit mod289.\n\nThus, the minimal m is110. Wait, but wait a second, let me check n= 155. 155 mod289 is155, but 155 is larger than110. So 110 is the minimal. So the answer is m=110.\n\nWait, but let me check one more thing. The problem says \"the least positive integer m such that m^4 +1 is divisible by p\u00b2\". Since p is 17, so p\u00b2=289. So the minimal m is110. Therefore, the final answer should be 110?\n\nWait, but I have to confirm that there isn't a smaller m. Let me check n= 110 is indeed the smallest. Let me check n= 110 divided by17 is ~6.47, so the k was6. The minimal n is 110. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a solution with n less than17? For example, n=2, which gives 17, but not 289. n=8 gives 8^4 +1=4096+1=4097. Divided by289? 289*14=4046. 4097-4046=51, so remainder51. Not divisible.\n\nSimilarly n=9: 9^4+1=6561+1=6562. Divided by289: 289*22=6358. 6562-6358=204. 204 mod289\u22600.\n\nn=15:15^4+1=50625+1=50626. Divided by289: 289*175=50575, 50626-50575=51. Not divisible.\n\nn= 25: as before, gives 25^4 +1=390625 +1=390626. Divided by289:\n\n289*1350=289*(1300+50)=289*1300=375700, 289*50=14450 \u2192 total 375700+14450=390,150. 390,626-390,150=476. 476 mod289 is476-289=187. Not 0.\n\nThus, no smaller n works. So the minimal m is indeed110.\n\nWait, but let me check once more with n= 110. Let me compute 110^4 +1:\n\n110^4 = (110\u00b2)^2 = (12100)^2. But that's a big number. Alternatively, modulo289, we know it's -1 mod289, so 110^4 +1\u22610 mod289. So correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is m=110. Wait, but let me check the problem again:\n\n\"Let p be the least prime number for which there exists a positive integer n such that n^{4}+1 is divisible by p^{2}. Find the least positive integer m such that m^{4}+1 is divisible by p^{2}.\"\n\nYes, so p is the smallest such prime, which we found to be17, and the minimal m is110. So the final answer is110.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Wait, when I started the problem, I thought the minimal prime is17. But is there a smaller prime that I missed?\n\nWait, let's think again. Earlier primes like 17 is the first prime \u22611 mod8. But maybe there are primes p where p\u00b2 divides n^4 +1 even when p\u2261 not 1 mod8? Wait, but for p divides n^4 +1, then n^4\u2261-1 modp, so -1 must be a quartic residue modp, which requires p\u22611 mod8. Because if p divides n^4 +1, then the order of n modp divides8, and since n^4\u2261-1, the order is8. Hence p\u22611 mod8. So primes p must be 1 mod8, so 17 is the smallest such prime. So p=17 is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is m=110. Wait, but let me check an online source or calculation to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps my calculation of the Hensel step for n=8 mod17 is correct?\n\nYes, the process was:\n\nFor n=8 mod17, we set n=8 +17k, then expand (8+17k)^4 +1 mod289. The first term is8^4=4096 mod289.\n\nWait, wait a second, earlier I computed 8^4 mod289 as50. Let me verify:\n\n8^2=64; 8^4=64^2=4096. Now divide 4096 by289:\n\n289*14=4046, so 4096-4046=50. So yes, 8^4\u226150 mod289. Then adding the second term 136k mod289. So 50+136k +1=51+136k. Set to 0 mod289:\n\n136k \u2261-51 mod289. Then dividing by gcd(136,289)=17:\n\n136=8*17; 51=3*17; 289=17\u00b2. So divide equation by17:\n\n8k \u2261-3 mod17 \u21d28k\u226114 mod17. Then inverse of8 mod17 is15, so k\u226114*15 mod17=210 mod17. 210 divided by17: 17*12=204, so 6 mod17. So k=6, leading to n=8+17*6=110. That is correct.\n\nThus, the answer should be 110. Wait, but I recall that in some references, the smallest n for 17\u00b2 is 5772, but perhaps I'm confusing with another problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in Hensel's lemma. Wait, Hensel's lemma says that if f(n\u2080)\u22610 modp and f\u2019(n\u2080) not\u22610 modp, then there is a unique lift modp\u00b2. So in this case, for n\u2080=2 mod17, f(n)=n^4+1, f\u2019(n)=4n\u00b3. At n=2, f\u2019(2)=32\u226115 mod17\u22600. So lift exists, and similarly for n=8, f\u2019(8)=4*(8)^3 mod17. 8^3 mod17 is (8 mod17)^3=512 mod17. 17*30=510, so 512\u22612 mod17. Thus, f\u2019(8)=4*2=8 mod17\u22600. So lifting is valid. So the computations are correct.\n\nTherefore, the minimal m is110. So the final answer is 110.\n\nWait, but wait, hold on. Wait when I computed for n=8 mod17, the solution was n=110. But let me check n= 110 divided by17 is6.47, so 110=17\u00d76 +8. So yes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the first step. Let me recompute the Hensel step for n=8 mod17.\n\nWe have f(n)=n^4 +1. Let n\u2080=8 mod17. We need to solve f(n\u2080 +17k)\u22610 mod17\u00b2.\n\nExpand f(n\u2080 +17k)= (n\u2080 +17k)^4 +1. Expanding:\n\n= n\u2080^4 +4n\u2080\u00b3(17k) +6n\u2080\u00b2(17k)^2 +4n\u2080(17k)^3 + (17k)^4 +1.\n\nModulo17\u00b2, terms with (17k)^2 or higher are 0 mod17\u00b2. So we have:\n\n\u2261 n\u2080^4 +4n\u2080\u00b3(17k) +1 mod17\u00b2.\n\nSet this equal to0 mod17\u00b2:\n\nn\u2080^4 +4n\u2080\u00b3(17k) +1 \u22610 mod17\u00b2.\n\nBut n\u2080^4 \u2261-1 mod17, so n\u2080^4 = -1 +17m for some integer m. Therefore,\n\n(-1 +17m) +4n\u2080\u00b3(17k) +1 \u22610 mod17\u00b2 \u21d217m + 4n\u2080\u00b3*17k \u22610 mod17\u00b2 \u21d217*(m +4n\u2080\u00b3k)\u22610 mod17\u00b2 \u21d2m +4n\u2080\u00b3k \u22610 mod17.\n\nThus, solving for k: 4n\u2080\u00b3k \u2261-m mod17. But m=(n\u2080^4 +1)/17. Since n\u2080^4 \u2261-1 mod17, so n\u2080^4 +1\u22610 mod17, so m is an integer. Let me compute m for n\u2080=8:\n\nn\u2080=8: n\u2080^4 +1=4096 +1=4097. Divide by17: 4097/17=241. So m=241. Therefore,\n\n4*(8)^3 *k \u2261-241 mod17.\n\nCompute 8^3 mod17:8^2=64\u226113 mod17, 8^3=8*13=104\u2261104-85=19\u22612 mod17.\n\nThus, 4*2*k \u2261-241 mod17 \u21d28k\u2261-241 mod17.\n\nCompute -241 mod17: 17*14=238, so -241\u2261-241+238= -3 mod17\u226114 mod17.\n\nSo 8k\u226114 mod17 \u21d2k\u226114*(8^{-1}) mod17.\n\nThe inverse of8 mod17 is15, since8*15=120\u2261120-119=1 mod17.\n\nThus, k\u226114*15=210\u2261210-17*12=210-204=6 mod17. Which matches previous result. So k=6. So n\u2080 +17k=8+102=110. Correct.\n\nTherefore, calculations are correct. So the minimal m is110. Therefore, the answer is 110. But I feel like maybe I should confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal m is 5772? Wait, that seems too big. Wait, maybe I need to check an example.\n\nWait, according to some references, the smallest n where n^4 +1 is divisible by17\u00b2 is indeed 110. Let me see:\n\nCompute 110^4 +1:\n\n110^2 = 12100\n\n110^4 = (12100)^2 = 146,410,000\n\nAdd 1:146,410,001\n\nDivide by289:\n\nCompute 289 \u00d7 506,600 = ?\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute 146,410,001 /289:\n\nLet me see, 289 \u00d7 500,000 =144,500,000\n\nSubtract:146,410,001 -144,500,000 =1,910,001\n\nNow 289 \u00d76,600=289\u00d76000=1,734,000; 289\u00d7600=173,400 \u2192 total 1,734,000+173,400=1,907,400\n\nSubtract:1,910,001 -1,907,400=2,601\n\n289\u00d79=2,601. So total is500,000 +6,600 +9=506,609.\n\nThus, 289\u00d7506,609=146,410,001. Therefore, 110^4 +1 is indeed divisible by289. So correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 110. So I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{110}\n\n\nTo find the least prime \\( p \\) such that there exists a positive integer \\( n \\) for which \\( p^2 \\) divides \\( n^4 + 1 \\), we need to consider primes \\( p \\equiv 1 \\mod 8 \\).
