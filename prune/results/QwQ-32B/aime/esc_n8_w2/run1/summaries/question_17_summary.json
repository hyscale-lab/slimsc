      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a set of rectangular boxes, each with surface area 54 and volume 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, then compute r squared and express it as a fraction p/q, then find p+q. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a rectangular box with dimensions a, b, c, the surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac) and the volume is abc. The problem states that these are fixed at 54 and 23 respectively. So, 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest sphere that can contain each such box. The sphere must be able to contain the box regardless of its orientation, right? So the sphere needs to have a diameter at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. Wait, actually, the minimal sphere that can contain a box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. Because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box. Therefore, the radius would be half of the space diagonal. So, if we can find the minimal possible maximum space diagonal among all boxes in set B, then r would be half that, and r squared is (space diagonal)^2 divided by 4. \n\nWait, hold on. Wait, actually, the sphere needs to contain all the boxes in B, so actually, the sphere must be large enough to contain every possible box in B. Therefore, the radius must be at least as big as the maximum space diagonal of any box in B divided by 2. Therefore, to find the minimal such sphere, we need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, then take half of that as the radius. Therefore, r^2 would be ( (max space diagonal)^2 ) / 4. So our task reduces to finding the maximum possible space diagonal of a box with surface area 54 and volume 23, then compute (d_max)^2 /4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to confirm that the space diagonal is indeed the critical dimension here. Suppose the sphere is centered at the center of the box. Then the furthest points from the center are the vertices, which are at a distance of half the space diagonal. Therefore, the radius needed is exactly half the space diagonal. So to contain the box, the sphere must have radius at least half the space diagonal. So, to find the smallest sphere that can contain all boxes in B, we need the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B, then divide by 2. So r is (max space diagonal)/2, and r squared is (space diagonal)^2 divided by 4.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find the maximum possible space diagonal d = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc =23. Then, to maximize d, so we need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given those constraints.\n\nHmm, okay, so perhaps we can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of the given quantities?\n\nRecall that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since we know that 2(ab + bc + ac) =54, so ab + bc + ac =27. Therefore, (a + b + c)^2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 54. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 -54. But that might not be helpful unless we can relate a + b + c to the volume.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers here to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 subject to the constraints 2(ab + bc + ac)=54 and abc=23. Hmm, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since there are three variables, maybe we can parametrize two variables in terms of the third, but that might get complicated. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider variables x = a^2, y = b^2, z = c^2. Then, the space diagonal squared is x + y + z, which is what we need to maximize. The surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, so ab + bc + ac =27. The volume is abc =23.\n\nHmm, but how do we relate these?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables as a, b, c. Let me note that for given surface area and volume, the variables a, b, c must satisfy those equations. Let me see if I can set up equations here.\n\nLet me denote S = ab + bc + ac =27, V = abc =23. We need to find the maximum value of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2.\n\nWe can recall that for three variables, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac). Since ab + bc + ac is known (27), this would be (a + b + c)^2 - 54. Therefore, to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, we need to maximize (a + b + c)^2, hence maximize a + b + c.\n\nSo the problem reduces to maximizing a + b + c given that ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here.\n\nLet me set up the function to maximize: f(a,b,c)=a + b + c\n\nsubject to constraints:\n\ng(a,b,c)=ab + bc + ac -27 =0,\n\nh(a,b,c)=abc -23 =0.\n\nSo we can use Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. The gradients should satisfy:\n\n\u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g + \u03bc\u2207h.\n\nCalculating the gradients:\n\n\u2207f = (1,1,1),\n\n\u2207g = (b + c, a + c, a + b),\n\n\u2207h = (bc, ac, ab).\n\nTherefore, equations:\n\n1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc,\n\n1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc ac,\n\n1 = \u03bb(a + b) + \u03bc ab,\n\nalong with the constraints ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23.\n\nHmm, this might get a bit complicated, but perhaps we can assume symmetry here? Wait, but the problem states that the boxes can be any with those surface area and volume, so perhaps the maximum occurs at some symmetric case? But since the surface area and volume are fixed, perhaps the variables are not symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can assume two variables are equal? Let's suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b. Maybe that could lead us somewhere. Let me try that.\n\nLet me suppose that a = b. Then, let me denote a = b = x, c = y.\n\nThen the surface area equation becomes 2(x^2 + 2xy) =54, so x\u00b2 + 2xy =27.\n\nVolume is x\u00b2 y =23.\n\nWe need to find a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 2x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nSo let me write equations:\n\nFrom the surface area:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2xy =27,\n\nand Volume:\n\nx\u00b2 y =23.\n\nWe can solve for y from the surface area equation:\n\ny = (27 -x\u00b2)/(2x).\n\nThen substitute into the volume equation:\n\nx\u00b2 * [(27 - x\u00b2)/(2x)] =23,\n\nSimplify:\n\nx*(27 -x\u00b2)/2 =23,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nx(27 - x\u00b2) =46,\n\nWhich gives:\n\n27x - x\u00b3 =46,\n\nRearranged:\n\nx\u00b3 -27x +46 =0.\n\nHmm, so we have a cubic equation here: x\u00b3 -27x +46 =0.\n\nLet me try to find rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nTesting x=2: 8 -54 +46 =0. 8-54 is -46, -46 +46=0. Hey, x=2 is a root!\n\nTherefore, (x -2) is a factor. Let's factor the cubic:\n\nx\u00b3 -27x +46 = (x -2)(x\u00b2 +2x -23).\n\nLet me check:\n\nMultiply (x -2)(x\u00b2 +2x -23) = x\u00b3 +2x\u00b2 -23x -2x\u00b2 -4x +46 =x\u00b3 -27x +46. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=2 and roots of x\u00b2 +2x -23 =0. The other roots are x = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since x is a length, it must be positive, so the other positive root is -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898. So two real positive roots: x=2 and x\u22483.898.\n\nTherefore, possible solutions for x are 2 and the other positive root. Let's consider x=2 first.\n\nIf x=2, then y=(27 -4)/(2*2)=23/4=5.75.\n\nThus, dimensions are a=b=2, c=23/4. Let me check the volume: 2*2*(23/4)= (4)*(23/4)=23, correct. Surface area: 2*(2*2 +2*(23/4) +2*(23/4))=2*(4 + (23/2) + (23/2)) = 2*(4 +23)=2*27=54, correct. Good.\n\nThe other solution with x\u22483.898. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me compute x = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.899 \u2248 3.899. Let me compute y:\n\ny=(27 -x\u00b2)/(2x). Let me compute x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = (-1 +2\u221a6)^2 =1 -4\u221a6 + (2\u221a6)^2 =1 -4\u221a6 +24=25 -4\u221a6 \u224825 -9.798\u224815.202.\n\nThus, 27 -x\u00b2\u224827 -15.202\u224811.798.\n\nThen y\u224811.798/(2*3.899)\u224811.798/7.798\u22481.513.\n\nTherefore, dimensions a=b\u22483.899, c\u22481.513. Let me check volume:\n\nx\u00b2 y \u2248 (15.202)*(1.513)\u224823, which is correct. Surface area: x\u00b2 +2xy \u224815.202 +2*(3.899)*(1.513)\u224815.202 + 11.8\u224827, which works.\n\nTherefore, there are two possible solutions when a=b. So, the space diagonal squared in the first case (a=b=2, c=23/4):\n\nd1\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 +2\u00b2 + (23/4)^2 =4+4 + (529/16)=8 + 529/16 = (128 +529)/16 =657/16\u224841.0625.\n\nIn the second case, with a=b\u22483.899, c\u22481.513:\n\nd2\u00b2\u2248 (3.899)^2 + (3.899)^2 + (1.513)^2 \u22482*(15.202) +2.289\u224830.404 +2.289\u224832.693, which is smaller. Wait, so the first case gives a larger space diagonal. So in the case when a=b=2, the space diagonal squared is 657/16\u224841.06, whereas the other case gives a smaller value. Therefore, the maximum occurs at a=b=2, c=23/4.\n\nBut wait, but maybe there are other configurations where the space diagonal is even larger? For example, when all three sides are different?\n\nHmm, perhaps we need to check that. Since we assumed two variables are equal, but maybe the maximum occurs when all variables are different. So maybe my assumption of a=b is not leading to the maximum? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, so that's the case. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum is when one variable is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers with three variables without assuming symmetry.\n\nLet me try to proceed with Lagrange multipliers. Let me recall the equations:\n\nFrom the Lagrangian method, we have the equations:\n\n1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc,\n\n1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc ac,\n\n1 = \u03bb(a + b) + \u03bc ab,\n\nalong with ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n1 -1 = \u03bb[(a +c) - (b +c)] + \u03bc(ac - bc),\n\n0 = \u03bb(a - b) + \u03bc c(a - b),\n\nTherefore, (a - b)(\u03bb + \u03bc c)=0.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the second and third equations:\n\n0 = \u03bb(b - a) + \u03bc ab - \u03bc ac,\n\nWait, let me do that again.\n\nSecond equation minus third equation:\n\n[1 -1] = \u03bb[(a + c) - (a + b)] + \u03bc(ac - ab),\n\n0 = \u03bb(c - b) + \u03bc a(c - b),\n\nTherefore, (c - b)(\u03bb + \u03bc a)=0.\n\nSimilarly, first minus third:\n\n[1 -1] = \u03bb[(b + c) - (a + b)] + \u03bc(bc - ab),\n\n0 = \u03bb(c -a) + \u03bc b(c - a),\n\nTherefore, (c -a)(\u03bb + \u03bc b)=0.\n\nTherefore, either variables are equal or the terms in the parentheses are zero.\n\nSo there are two possibilities for each pair:\n\nEither variables are equal, or \u03bb + \u03bc c =0, etc.\n\nCase 1: All variables equal. If a = b = c, then the surface area would be 6a\u00b2 =54 \u21d2 a\u00b2=9 \u21d2 a=3. Then volume would be a\u00b3=27, but we need volume 23. So that's not possible. So the symmetric case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: Two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's suppose a = b \u2260 c. Then from the first set of equations, since a = b, then the first two equations give the same equation, so no contradiction. The other equations would then lead us to the previous case where we assumed a = b, so that's covered in the first approach. Therefore, the maximum may occur here.\n\nAlternatively, if all variables are different, then we must have \u03bb + \u03bc c =0,\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc a =0,\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc b =0.\n\nTherefore, setting these equal:\n\nFrom the first two: \u03bb + \u03bc c = \u03bb + \u03bc a \u21d2 \u03bc(c -a)=0. Since variables are different, c \u2260a, so \u03bc=0.\n\nBut then from \u03bb + \u03bc c =0 \u21d2 \u03bb=0, but then the original equations would have 1=0, which is impossible. Therefore, the case where all variables are different cannot satisfy the Lagrangian conditions. Therefore, the maximum must occur when at least two variables are equal. So the cases we considered before when two variables are equal are the critical points.\n\nTherefore, the maximum space diagonal would be either when a=b=2, c=23/4 or when a=b\u22483.899, c\u22481.513. Since in the first case, the space diagonal squared is 657/16 \u224841.06, and in the second case it's less, so the first case gives the maximum. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal squared is 657/16, so r squared is (657/16)/4 = 657/(64). Wait, hold on, no.\n\nWait, space diagonal squared is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, which in the first case is 2\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + (23/4)^2. Let me recalculate that:\n\n2\u00b2 is 4, so two of them make 8. Then (23/4)^2 is (529)/16. So total is 8 + 529/16. 8 is 128/16, so total is (128 + 529)/16 = 657/16. So that is correct. So space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the radius squared is (657/16)/4 = 657/64. Wait, but radius is half the space diagonal, so radius squared is (d^2)/4. So yes, exactly. So 657 divided by 64. Let me check if 657 and 64 are coprime. 64 is 2^6. 657 divided by 3 is 219, so 657 is 3\u00d7219=3\u00d73\u00d773. 73 is prime. 64 is 2^6, so no common factors. Therefore, 657 and 64 are coprime? Wait 657: prime factors are 3,3,73. 64 is 2^6, so yes, gcd(657,64)=1. Wait, 657 divided by 2 is 328.5, so no, so yes, the fraction is reduced. Therefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=721.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Is that the maximum? Let me confirm that there isn't a case where all three variables are different which gives a larger space diagonal?\n\nFrom the Lagrangian method, we saw that if all variables are different, then the Lagrangian conditions lead to a contradiction, meaning that the extrema can only occur when two variables are equal. Therefore, the maximum must indeed be at one of the symmetric cases where two variables are equal. Since in the case a=b=2, c=23/4 gives a larger space diagonal, that is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if there is another case where a different pair of variables are equal. For example, suppose a = c, then similar equations would follow. Let me see.\n\nSuppose a = c, so let a = c =x, b = y.\n\nThen the surface area equation: 2(x\u00b2 + 2xy) =54 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + 2xy =27,\n\nVolume: x\u00b2 y =23,\n\nSame as when a = b. So the equations would be the same, so we would get similar solutions. Therefore, this case would lead to the same maximum.\n\nSimilarly, if b = c, same result. So the maximum occurs in those cases. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal squared is indeed 657/16, so r squared is 657/64, so the answer is 657 +64 =721. Wait, but hold on. Wait, let me check my calculation again.\n\nWait, let me recheck the space diagonal squared when a = b =2, c=23/4.\n\na = 2, b=2, c=23/4 =5.75.\n\nSo space diagonal squared is (2)^2 + (2)^2 + (5.75)^2.\n\nCalculating:\n\n2\u00b2 +2\u00b2 =4 +4=8,\n\n5.75 squared is (23/4)^2 = (23)^2 /16 =529/16.\n\nThus, total is 8 + 529/16. Convert 8 to 128/16, so total is (128 +529)/16 =657/16. Correct.\n\nTherefore, space diagonal squared is 657/16, so radius squared is (657/16)/4 =657/64. Since 657 and 64 share no common factors (as 64 is 2^6 and 657 is divisible by 3 but not 2), so yes, fraction is reduced. Therefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me think again if there could be another critical point when variables are not equal but satisfy some other conditions? The Lagrangian method suggested that unless two variables are equal, you end up with \u03bc=0 and \u03bb=0, which is impossible, so the only critical points are when two variables are equal, so the maximum must be among those. Therefore, I think this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in assuming that the maximum occurs at a=b=2? Let me see if there's another case when variables are unequal but give a larger diagonal.\n\nSuppose, for instance, that one of the sides is very large and the others are small. Let me see if that is possible under the constraints.\n\nSuppose a approaches infinity, then to keep the volume fixed at 23, b*c would have to approach zero. But the surface area is 2(ab + bc +ac)=54. If a is large, then terms ab and ac would dominate, so to keep the surface area finite, b and c must approach zero in such a way that ab and ac remain bounded. Let's see:\n\nSuppose a is very large, so let\u2019s set b = k/a and c = m/a, so that as a\u2192\u221e, b and c go to zero. Then volume is a*(k/a)*(m/a)= (k m)/a\u00b2 =23. To have this approach 23, we need k m /a\u00b2 =23, which would require a\u21920, which contradicts a\u2192\u221e. So this is impossible. Therefore, a cannot go to infinity. Therefore, all variables are bounded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at the other critical point where a\u22483.899, but that gives a smaller space diagonal. So, indeed, the first critical point is the maximum.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The value of r squared is 657/64, so p + q is 721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem. Hmm, so we have a set of rectangular boxes, each with surface area 54 and volume 23. We need to find the radius of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, then compute r squared and express it as a fraction p/q, then find p+q. Alright, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a rectangular box with dimensions a, b, c, the surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac) and the volume is abc. The problem states that these are fixed at 54 and 23 respectively. So, 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc = 23.\n\nOur goal is to find the smallest sphere that can contain each such box. The sphere must be able to contain the box regardless of its orientation, right? So the sphere needs to have a diameter at least as large as the space diagonal of the box. Wait, actually, the minimal sphere that can contain a box must have a diameter equal to the space diagonal of the box. Because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box. Therefore, the radius would be half of the space diagonal. So, if we can find the minimal possible maximum space diagonal among all boxes in set B, then r would be half that, and r squared is (space diagonal)^2 divided by 4. \n\nWait, hold on. Wait, actually, the sphere needs to contain all the boxes in B, so actually, the sphere must be large enough to contain every possible box in B. Therefore, the radius must be at least as big as the maximum space diagonal of any box in B divided by 2. Therefore, to find the minimal such sphere, we need to find the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, then take half of that as the radius. Therefore, r^2 would be ( (max space diagonal)^2 ) / 4. So our task reduces to finding the maximum possible space diagonal of a box with surface area 54 and volume 23, then compute (d_max)^2 /4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I need to confirm that the space diagonal is indeed the critical dimension here. Suppose the sphere is centered at the center of the box. Then the furthest points from the center are the vertices, which are at a distance of half the space diagonal. Therefore, the radius needed is exactly half the space diagonal. So to contain the box, the sphere must have radius at least half the space diagonal. So, to find the smallest sphere that can contain all boxes in B, we need the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B, then divide by 2. So r is (max space diagonal)/2, and r squared is (space diagonal)^2 divided by 4.\n\nTherefore, the key is to find the maximum possible space diagonal d = sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) given that 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54 and abc =23. Then, to maximize d, so we need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given those constraints.\n\nHmm, okay, so perhaps we can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of the given quantities?\n\nRecall that (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac). Since we know that 2(ab + bc + ac) =54, so ab + bc + ac =27. Therefore, (a + b + c)^2 = (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) + 54. Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 -54. But that might not be helpful unless we can relate a + b + c to the volume.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers here to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 subject to the constraints 2(ab + bc + ac)=54 and abc=23. Hmm, but maybe there's a smarter way.\n\nAlternatively, since there are three variables, maybe we can parametrize two variables in terms of the third, but that might get complicated. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider variables x = a^2, y = b^2, z = c^2. Then, the space diagonal squared is x + y + z, which is what we need to maximize. The surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, so ab + bc + ac =27. The volume is abc =23.\n\nHmm, but how do we relate these?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express variables as a, b, c. Let me note that for given surface area and volume, the variables a, b, c must satisfy those equations. Let me see if I can set up equations here.\n\nLet me denote S = ab + bc + ac =27, V = abc =23. We need to find the maximum value of a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2.\n\nWe can recall that for three variables, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac). Since ab + bc + ac is known (27), this would be (a + b + c)^2 - 54. Therefore, to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, we need to maximize (a + b + c)^2, hence maximize a + b + c.\n\nSo the problem reduces to maximizing a + b + c given that ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here.\n\nLet me set up the function to maximize: f(a,b,c)=a + b + c\n\nsubject to constraints:\n\ng(a,b,c)=ab + bc + ac -27 =0,\n\nh(a,b,c)=abc -23 =0.\n\nSo we can use Lagrange multipliers with two constraints. The gradients should satisfy:\n\n\u2207f = \u03bb\u2207g + \u03bc\u2207h.\n\nCalculating the gradients:\n\n\u2207f = (1,1,1),\n\n\u2207g = (b + c, a + c, a + b),\n\n\u2207h = (bc, ac, ab).\n\nTherefore, equations:\n\n1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc,\n\n1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc ac,\n\n1 = \u03bb(a + b) + \u03bc ab,\n\nalong with the constraints ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23.\n\nHmm, this might get a bit complicated, but perhaps we can assume symmetry here? Wait, but the problem states that the boxes can be any with those surface area and volume, so perhaps the maximum occurs at some symmetric case? But since the surface area and volume are fixed, perhaps the variables are not symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can assume two variables are equal? Let's suppose that two variables are equal, say a = b. Maybe that could lead us somewhere. Let me try that.\n\nLet me suppose that a = b. Then, let me denote a = b = x, c = y.\n\nThen the surface area equation becomes 2(x^2 + 2xy) =54, so x\u00b2 + 2xy =27.\n\nVolume is x\u00b2 y =23.\n\nWe need to find a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 2x\u00b2 + y\u00b2.\n\nSo let me write equations:\n\nFrom the surface area:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2xy =27,\n\nand Volume:\n\nx\u00b2 y =23.\n\nWe can solve for y from the surface area equation:\n\ny = (27 -x\u00b2)/(2x).\n\nThen substitute into the volume equation:\n\nx\u00b2 * [(27 - x\u00b2)/(2x)] =23,\n\nSimplify:\n\nx*(27 -x\u00b2)/2 =23,\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nx(27 - x\u00b2) =46,\n\nWhich gives:\n\n27x - x\u00b3 =46,\n\nRearranged:\n\nx\u00b3 -27x +46 =0.\n\nHmm, so we have a cubic equation here: x\u00b3 -27x +46 =0.\n\nLet me try to find rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nTesting x=2: 8 -54 +46 =0. 8-54 is -46, -46 +46=0. Hey, x=2 is a root!\n\nTherefore, (x -2) is a factor. Let's factor the cubic:\n\nx\u00b3 -27x +46 = (x -2)(x\u00b2 +2x -23).\n\nLet me check:\n\nMultiply (x -2)(x\u00b2 +2x -23) = x\u00b3 +2x\u00b2 -23x -2x\u00b2 -4x +46 =x\u00b3 -27x +46. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the roots are x=2 and roots of x\u00b2 +2x -23 =0. The other roots are x = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since x is a length, it must be positive, so the other positive root is -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.898 \u2248 3.898. So two real positive roots: x=2 and x\u22483.898.\n\nTherefore, possible solutions for x are 2 and the other positive root. Let's consider x=2 first.\n\nIf x=2, then y=(27 -4)/(2*2)=23/4=5.75.\n\nThus, dimensions are a=b=2, c=23/4. Let me check the volume: 2*2*(23/4)= (4)*(23/4)=23, correct. Surface area: 2*(2*2 +2*(23/4) +2*(23/4))=2*(4 + (23/2) + (23/2)) = 2*(4 +23)=2*27=54, correct. Good.\n\nThe other solution with x\u22483.898. Let me compute that.\n\nLet me compute x = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.899 \u2248 3.899. Let me compute y:\n\ny=(27 -x\u00b2)/(2x). Let me compute x\u00b2:\n\nx\u00b2 = (-1 +2\u221a6)^2 =1 -4\u221a6 + (2\u221a6)^2 =1 -4\u221a6 +24=25 -4\u221a6 \u224825 -9.798\u224815.202.\n\nThus, 27 -x\u00b2\u224827 -15.202\u224811.798.\n\nThen y\u224811.798/(2*3.899)\u224811.798/7.798\u22481.513.\n\nTherefore, dimensions a=b\u22483.899, c\u22481.513. Let me check volume:\n\nx\u00b2 y \u2248 (15.202)*(1.513)\u224823, which is correct. Surface area: x\u00b2 +2xy \u224815.202 +2*(3.899)*(1.513)\u224815.202 + 11.8\u224827, which works.\n\nTherefore, there are two possible solutions when a=b. So, the space diagonal squared in the first case (a=b=2, c=23/4):\n\nd1\u00b2 = 2\u00b2 +2\u00b2 + (23/4)^2 =4+4 + (529/16)=8 + 529/16 = (128 +529)/16 =657/16\u224841.0625.\n\nIn the second case, with a=b\u22483.899, c\u22481.513:\n\nd2\u00b2\u2248 (3.899)^2 + (3.899)^2 + (1.513)^2 \u22482*(15.202) +2.289\u224830.404 +2.289\u224832.693, which is smaller. Wait, so the first case gives a larger space diagonal. So in the case when a=b=2, the space diagonal squared is 657/16\u224841.06, whereas the other case gives a smaller value. Therefore, the maximum occurs at a=b=2, c=23/4.\n\nBut wait, but maybe there are other configurations where the space diagonal is even larger? For example, when all three sides are different?\n\nHmm, perhaps we need to check that. Since we assumed two variables are equal, but maybe the maximum occurs when all variables are different. So maybe my assumption of a=b is not leading to the maximum? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal, so that's the case. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum is when one variable is as large as possible, and the others are as small as possible. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers with three variables without assuming symmetry.\n\nLet me try to proceed with Lagrange multipliers. Let me recall the equations:\n\nFrom the Lagrangian method, we have the equations:\n\n1 = \u03bb(b + c) + \u03bc bc,\n\n1 = \u03bb(a + c) + \u03bc ac,\n\n1 = \u03bb(a + b) + \u03bc ab,\n\nalong with ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23.\n\nHmm, so perhaps we can subtract the first equation from the second:\n\n1 -1 = \u03bb[(a +c) - (b +c)] + \u03bc(ac - bc),\n\n0 = \u03bb(a - b) + \u03bc c(a - b),\n\nTherefore, (a - b)(\u03bb + \u03bc c)=0.\n\nSimilarly, subtracting the second and third equations:\n\n0 = \u03bb(b - a) + \u03bc ab - \u03bc ac,\n\nWait, let me do that again.\n\nSecond equation minus third equation:\n\n[1 -1] = \u03bb[(a + c) - (a + b)] + \u03bc(ac - ab),\n\n0 = \u03bb(c - b) + \u03bc a(c - b),\n\nTherefore, (c - b)(\u03bb + \u03bc a)=0.\n\nSimilarly, first minus third:\n\n[1 -1] = \u03bb[(b + c) - (a + b)] + \u03bc(bc - ab),\n\n0 = \u03bb(c -a) + \u03bc b(c - a),\n\nTherefore, (c -a)(\u03bb + \u03bc b)=0.\n\nTherefore, either variables are equal or the terms in the parentheses are zero.\n\nSo there are two possibilities for each pair:\n\nEither variables are equal, or \u03bb + \u03bc c =0, etc.\n\nCase 1: All variables equal. If a = b = c, then the surface area would be 6a\u00b2 =54 \u21d2 a\u00b2=9 \u21d2 a=3. Then volume would be a\u00b3=27, but we need volume 23. So that's not possible. So the symmetric case is invalid.\n\nCase 2: Two variables are equal, and the third is different. Let's suppose a = b \u2260 c. Then from the first set of equations, since a = b, then the first two equations give the same equation, so no contradiction. The other equations would then lead us to the previous case where we assumed a = b, so that's covered in the first approach. Therefore, the maximum may occur here.\n\nAlternatively, if all variables are different, then we must have \u03bb + \u03bc c =0,\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc a =0,\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc b =0.\n\nTherefore, setting these equal:\n\nFrom the first two: \u03bb + \u03bc c = \u03bb + \u03bc a \u21d2 \u03bc(c -a)=0. Since variables are different, c \u2260a, so \u03bc=0.\n\nBut then from \u03bb + \u03bc c =0 \u21d2 \u03bb=0, but then the original equations would have 1=0, which is impossible. Therefore, the case where all variables are different cannot satisfy the Lagrangian conditions. Therefore, the maximum must occur when at least two variables are equal. So the cases we considered before when two variables are equal are the critical points.\n\nTherefore, the maximum space diagonal would be either when a=b=2, c=23/4 or when a=b\u22483.899, c\u22481.513. Since in the first case, the space diagonal squared is 657/16 \u224841.06, and in the second case it's less, so the first case gives the maximum. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal squared is 657/16, so r squared is (657/16)/4 = 657/(64). Wait, hold on, no.\n\nWait, space diagonal squared is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2, which in the first case is 2\u00b2 + 2\u00b2 + (23/4)^2. Let me recalculate that:\n\n2\u00b2 is 4, so two of them make 8. Then (23/4)^2 is (529)/16. So total is 8 + 529/16. 8 is 128/16, so total is (128 + 529)/16 = 657/16. So that is correct. So space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the radius squared is (657/16)/4 = 657/64. Wait, but radius is half the space diagonal, so radius squared is (d^2)/4. So yes, exactly. So 657 divided by 64. Let me check if 657 and 64 are coprime. 64 is 2^6. 657 divided by 3 is 219, so 657 is 3\u00d7219=3\u00d73\u00d773. 73 is prime. 64 is 2^6, so no common factors. Therefore, 657 and 64 are coprime? Wait 657: prime factors are 3,3,73. 64 is 2^6, so yes, gcd(657,64)=1. Wait, 657 divided by 2 is 328.5, so no, so yes, the fraction is reduced. Therefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=721.\n\nBut wait, hold on a second. Is that the maximum? Let me confirm that there isn't a case where all three variables are different which gives a larger space diagonal?\n\nFrom the Lagrangian method, we saw that if all variables are different, then the Lagrangian conditions lead to a contradiction, meaning that the extrema can only occur when two variables are equal. Therefore, the maximum must indeed be at one of the symmetric cases where two variables are equal. Since in the case a=b=2, c=23/4 gives a larger space diagonal, that is the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, let me check if there is another case where a different pair of variables are equal. For example, suppose a = c, then similar equations would follow. Let me see.\n\nSuppose a = c, so let a = c =x, b = y.\n\nThen the surface area equation: 2(x\u00b2 + 2xy) =54 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + 2xy =27,\n\nVolume: x\u00b2 y =23,\n\nSame as when a = b. So the equations would be the same, so we would get similar solutions. Therefore, this case would lead to the same maximum.\n\nSimilarly, if b = c, same result. So the maximum occurs in those cases. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal squared is indeed 657/16, so r squared is 657/64, so the answer is 657 +64 =721. Wait, but hold on. Wait, let me check my calculation again.\n\nWait, let me recheck the space diagonal squared when a = b =2, c=23/4.\n\na = 2, b=2, c=23/4 =5.75.\n\nSo space diagonal squared is (2)^2 + (2)^2 + (5.75)^2.\n\nCalculating:\n\n2\u00b2 +2\u00b2 =4 +4=8,\n\n5.75 squared is (23/4)^2 = (23)^2 /16 =529/16.\n\nThus, total is 8 + 529/16. Convert 8 to 128/16, so total is (128 +529)/16 =657/16. Correct.\n\nTherefore, space diagonal squared is 657/16, so radius squared is (657/16)/4 =657/64. Since 657 and 64 share no common factors (as 64 is 2^6 and 657 is divisible by 3 but not 2), so yes, fraction is reduced. Therefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me think again if there could be another critical point when variables are not equal but satisfy some other conditions? The Lagrangian method suggested that unless two variables are equal, you end up with \u03bc=0 and \u03bb=0, which is impossible, so the only critical points are when two variables are equal, so the maximum must be among those. Therefore, I think this is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's an error in assuming that the maximum occurs at a=b=2? Let me see if there's another case when variables are unequal but give a larger diagonal.\n\nSuppose, for instance, that one of the sides is very large and the others are small. Let me see if that is possible under the constraints.\n\nSuppose a approaches infinity, then to keep the volume fixed at 23, b*c would have to approach zero. But the surface area is 2(ab + bc +ac)=54. If a is large, then terms ab and ac would dominate, so to keep the surface area finite, b and c must approach zero in such a way that ab and ac remain bounded. Let's see:\n\nSuppose a is very large, so let\u2019s set b = k/a and c = m/a, so that as a\u2192\u221e, b and c go to zero. Then volume is a*(k/a)*(m/a)= (k m)/a\u00b2 =23. To have this approach 23, we need k m /a\u00b2 =23, which would require a\u21920, which contradicts a\u2192\u221e. So this is impossible. Therefore, a cannot go to infinity. Therefore, all variables are bounded.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at the other critical point where a\u22483.899, but that gives a smaller space diagonal. So, indeed, the first critical point is the maximum.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The value of r squared is 657/64, so p + q is 721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n\n\nGiven a set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the radius \\(r\\) of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then express that as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p+q. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let's call them x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz), and the volume is xyz. The problem states that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. So, we have two equations:\n\n1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \u21d2 xy + yz + xz = 27\n2. xyz = 23\n\nWe need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius of such a sphere would be half of the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere has to contain the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the minimal radius r would be (1/2) times the space diagonal. The space diagonal of a box with sides x, y, z is \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). So, r = (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2))/2. Therefore, r\u00b2 would be (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4. So, our goal is to find the minimal possible value of (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4 given the constraints on surface area and volume. Therefore, we need to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, so the problem reduces to minimizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 with the given constraints. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers? But since it's a problem with symmetric variables, perhaps there is a way to express x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 in terms of the given equations?\n\nWait, I recall that (x + y + z)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + 2(xy + yz + xz). Since we know that xy + yz + xz = 27, so if we can find x + y + z, then we can get x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2. Let me denote S = x + y + z, then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2*27 = S\u00b2 - 54. Therefore, we need to minimize S\u00b2 - 54, so equivalently minimize S\u00b2. Therefore, the problem reduces to minimizing (x + y + z)^2 given the constraints on the surface area and volume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express variables in terms of each other. Since xyz = 23, perhaps set variables in terms of some parameters? Hmm, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assuming symmetry? Maybe the minimal diagonal occurs when the box is as \"balanced\" as possible, like a cube? But since the volume is 23, which is not a perfect cube, so maybe not. But perhaps the minimal diagonal occurs when two sides are equal? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about minimizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, given the constraints, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints?\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote the function to minimize as f(x, y, z) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\ng(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz - 27 = 0,\n\nh(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.\n\nSo, we can set up the Lagrangian:\n\nL = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - \u03bb(xy + yz + xz - 27) - \u03bc(xyz - 23).\n\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and set them to zero.\n\nCompute \u2202L/\u2202x = 2x - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc(yz) = 0,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 2y - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc(xz) = 0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202z = 2z - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc(xy) = 0.\n\nHmm, so that gives three equations. Also, we have the two constraints:\n\nxy + yz + xz = 27,\n\nxyz = 23.\n\nThis seems a system of five equations with five variables (x, y, z, \u03bb, \u03bc). Solving this might be tricky, but perhaps there is some symmetry here. Let me see if x = y = z is possible. If that were the case, then we could set x = y = z. Let me check if that works.\n\nSuppose x = y = z. Then, the volume would be x\u00b3 = 23 \u21d2 x = \u221b23 \u2248 2.843. The surface area would be 6x\u00b2 = 6*(\u221b23)^2. Let me compute that: 6*(23^(2/3)). Let me see, 23^(1/3) is approximately 2.843, so squared is about 8.08, so 6*8.08 \u2248 48.5, but the problem states that the surface area must be 54, which is higher. So, that suggests that a cube with volume 23 has a smaller surface area than required here. Therefore, the actual boxes in set B must have a larger surface area, so they can't be cubes. Therefore, the minimal sphere might not be achieved by a cube. So, symmetry is broken here.\n\nHmm, so maybe two variables are equal? Let me suppose that two variables are equal, say x = y. Let me try that. Let x = y, then we can write equations in terms of x and z.\n\nLet me set x = y. Then, the volume becomes x\u00b2 z = 23,\n\nSurface area: 2(x\u00b2 + 2xz) = 54 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + 2xz = 27.\n\nSo, from the volume equation, z = 23/(x\u00b2). Substitute into the surface area equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x*(23/(x\u00b2)) = 27 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + (46/x) = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:\n\nx\u00b3 + 46 = 27x \u21d2 x\u00b3 -27x +46 =0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if there's an integer root. Let me try x=2: 8 - 54 +46 = 0. 8 -54 is -46 +46 is 0. So x=2 is a root. Therefore, (x -2) is a factor. Let's factor the cubic:\n\nx\u00b3 -27x +46 = (x -2)(x\u00b2 + 2x -23). Let me check: (x -2)(x\u00b2 + 2x -23) = x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 -23x -2x\u00b2 -4x +46 = x\u00b3 -27x +46. Correct.\n\nSo the other roots are solutions to x\u00b2 +2x -23=0, which would be x = [-2 \u00b1\u221a(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1\u221a96]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4\u221a6]/2 = -1 \u00b12\u221a6. Since x must be positive, only x = -1 +2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 +4.899 \u22483.899. So the roots are x=2 and x\u22483.899.\n\nSo, if x = y =2, then z =23/(2\u00b2)=23/4 =5.75. Let me check surface area:\n\n2(xy + yz +xz) =2(4 + 2*5.75 +2*5.75)=2(4 +11.5 +11.5)=2*(27)=54. Correct. So that's valid.\n\nThe other solution is x\u22483.899, so then z=23/(x\u00b2). Let me compute that. But since x is a real solution, maybe that's another critical point. However, since we need to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, perhaps the minimal occurs at x=2, or at the other critical point?\n\nWait, but we need to check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's compute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 when x=y=2, z=23/4.\n\nThen, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 4 +4 + (23/4)^2. Let's compute that:\n\n(23/4)^2 is (529)/16 \u224833.0625, so total is 8 + 33.0625 \u224841.0625. Therefore, r\u00b2 would be that divided by 4, so approx 10.265625.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the other critical point where x = y = -1 +2\u221a6. Let me compute that value numerically. Let me compute x \u2248-1 + 2*2.449 \u2248-1 +4.898\u22483.898. So, x \u22483.898, so z =23/(x\u00b2). Let me compute x squared: (3.898)^2\u224815.19, so z\u224823/15.19\u22481.515. Then, compute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 2*(3.898)^2 + (1.515)^2\u22482*(15.19)+2.295\u224830.38+2.295\u224832.675. Therefore, r\u00b2\u224832.675/4\u22488.16875. That's smaller. So, that would be better. Therefore, the minimal might be at that other critical point.\n\nHmm, so perhaps that is the minimal. But since I found this by assuming x=y, but maybe the true minimal occurs when all variables are different? So maybe this approach is not sufficient. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with the Lagrangian equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize variables in terms of two variables. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution. Let me think.\n\nWe have two equations: xy + yz + xz =27 and xyz=23.\n\nLet me consider variables x, y, z. Let me denote variables as a, b, c for simplicity. Let me think of them as roots of a cubic equation. Let me suppose that x, y, z are roots of the equation t\u00b3 - St\u00b2 + Pt - Q =0, where S =x+y+z, P=xy+yz+xz=27, Q=xyz=23. So the cubic equation would be t\u00b3 - S t\u00b2 +27 t -23=0.\n\nTherefore, if we can find S, then we can get x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -54. So our goal is to find the minimal possible S\u00b2 -54, so minimal S\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal possible value of S\u00b2 given that the cubic equation t\u00b3 - S t\u00b2 +27 t -23=0 has three positive real roots. Hmm, that might be another approach. To find the minimal S such that this cubic has three positive real roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using inequalities. Since we need to minimize S\u00b2, so S, so we need to minimize S. Wait, but is S necessarily minimized when variables are arranged in a certain way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the AM \u2265 GM inequality, but since we have constraints, maybe that's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the cubic equation. Let me denote the cubic as f(t)=t\u00b3 - S t\u00b2 +27 t -23. To have three real positive roots, the cubic must satisfy certain conditions. The discriminant must be non-negative, and the function must cross the t-axis three times in the positive reals.\n\nThe discriminant D of a cubic equation at\u00b3 + bt\u00b2 + ct +d is given by D = 18abcd -4b\u00b3d + b\u00b2c\u00b2 - 4ac\u00b3 -27a^4d\u00b2. But here a=1, so D = 18*1*(-S)*27*(-23) -4*(-S)^3*(-23) + (-S)^2*(27)^2 -4*1*(27)^3 -27*(1)^2*(-23)^2.\n\nHmm, this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe using calculus. The cubic must have a local maximum and minimum, and the function must cross the t-axis three times. Therefore, the derivative f\u2019(t)=3t\u00b2 - 2S t +27 must have two real roots, so discriminant must be positive. The discriminant of f\u2019 is (2S)^2 -4*3*27 =4S\u00b2 - 324. So 4S\u00b2 -324 >0 \u21d2 S\u00b2 >81 \u21d2 |S|>9. Since S is positive (sum of positive roots), so S>9.\n\nSo S must be greater than 9. Therefore, the minimal possible S is just over 9. But can S actually attain 9? Let me check if S=9 is possible.\n\nIf S=9, then the cubic equation is t\u00b3 -9t\u00b2 +27t -23=0. Let me see if this cubic has three real roots. Let me compute f(1)=1 -9 +27 -23= -4. f(2)=8 -36 +54 -23= -7. f(3)=27 -81 +81 -23=5. f(4)=64 - 144 +108 -23=5. Hmm, f(1)= -4, f(2)= -7, f(3)=5, so there is a root between 2 and 3. Also, as t approaches infinity, f(t) goes to infinity, and as t approaches negative infinity, it goes to negative infinity, but since all roots are positive, maybe only one positive root? Wait, but if S=9, the cubic is t\u00b3 -9t\u00b2 +27t -23. Let me check at t=0, f(0)= -23. At t=1, -4, t=2, -7, t=3, +5. So crossing from negative to positive between 2 and 3. Also, after t=3, it's positive? Let me check t=4: 64 - 144 + 108 -23= (64+108) - (144+23)=172 -167=5. So positive. Then, since it's a cubic, maybe only one real root? Wait, but the derivative at S=9 would have discriminant 4*(9)^2 - 324 = 324 - 324=0. So the derivative has a double root. So the cubic has a point of inflection. So in that case, maybe only one real root? Hmm. Therefore, S=9 is not possible because the cubic would have a multiple root and only one real root. Therefore, S must be greater than 9. So the minimal S is just over 9, but how do we find the minimal S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the method of substitution. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider that we have xyz=23 and xy + yz + xz=27. Let me try to express variables in terms of two variables. Let me set variables as x, y, and z=23/(xy). Then, substitute into the surface area equation:\n\nxy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) =27.\n\nSimplify:\n\nxy + 23/x +23/y =27.\n\nHmm, so that's an equation in x and y. Let me denote a =x, b=y. So:\n\nab + 23/a +23/b =27.\n\nWe need to find the minimal S =a + b + 23/(ab). Wait, no, S =x + y + z = a + b +23/(ab).\n\nSo our goal is to minimize S = a + b + 23/(ab) with the constraint ab +23/a +23/b =27.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe set variables such that a = b? Let me try that. Let me suppose a = b. Then, the equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2 + 2*(23/a) =27 \u21d2 a\u00b2 + 46/a =27.\n\nMultiply by a: a\u00b3 +46 =27a \u21d2a\u00b3 -27a +46=0. Wait, that's the same equation as before when I set x=y. So that's how we got the roots at a=2 and a\u22483.899. So when a=2, then S=2+2 +23/(4)=4 +5.75=9.75. When a\u22483.899, then S\u22483.899 +3.899 +23/(3.899^2). Let me compute that:\n\n3.899 squared is approx (3.9)^2 =15.21, so 23/15.21\u22481.513. Then total S\u22483.899*2 +1.513\u22487.798 +1.513\u22489.311. So that's lower than 9.75. So that is better. So, that suggests that when a and b are equal to that value (~3.899), the sum S is lower. But since S must be greater than 9, that's approaching 9.31, which is still above 9.\n\nBut is that the minimal? Or can we get even lower?\n\nAlternatively, maybe not setting a = b. Let me see. Let me think of variables a and b such that they are different. Maybe using calculus here.\n\nLet me consider the equation ab +23/a +23/b =27. Let me denote that as equation (1). We need to minimize S = a + b +23/(ab). Let me try to write S in terms of ab.\n\nLet me denote ab = k. Then, equation (1) becomes k +23(1/a +1/b)=27. Hmm, but 1/a +1/b = (a + b)/ab. Let me denote s =a + b, then 1/a +1/b = s/k. Therefore equation (1):\n\nk +23*(s/k)=27.\n\nSo, equation (1) can be rewritten as:\n\nk + (23 s)/k =27 \u21d2k\u00b2 +23 s =27k \u21d223 s =27k -k\u00b2 \u21d2 s= (27k -k\u00b2)/23.\n\nOur goal is to minimize S = s +23/(k). Substitute s from above:\n\nS = (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k.\n\nTherefore, S(k) = (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k.\n\nSo now, S is expressed solely in terms of k. We can now treat this as a function of k and find its minimum. Let me compute derivative of S with respect to k:\n\nS\u2019(k) = (27 - 2k)/23 -23/k\u00b2.\n\nSet derivative to zero:\n\n(27 - 2k)/23 -23/k\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 (27 -2k)/23 =23/k\u00b2 \u21d2 Multiply both sides by 23k\u00b2:\n\n(27 -2k)k\u00b2 =23\u00b2 \u21d227k\u00b2 -2k\u00b3 =529 \u21d22k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529 =0.\n\nHmm, so now we have a cubic equation: 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529=0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me check for rational roots. Possible rational roots are factors of 529 over factors of 2. 529 is 23 squared, so factors are \u00b11, \u00b123, \u00b1529, etc. divided by 1 or 2. Let me try k=23: 2*(23)^3 -27*(23)^2 +529. 23^3 is 12167, so 2*12167=24334, 27*529=14283, so 24334 -27*529 +529=24334 -27*529 +529=24334 -26*529. 26*529=13754, so 24334-13754=10580. Not zero. Hmm, k= something else.\n\nWait, perhaps k is not an integer. Let me see if I can approximate the root. Let me let f(k)=2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529.\n\nCompute f(9): 2*729 -27*81 +529=1458 -2187 +529= (1458+529)=1987 -2187= -200.\n\nf(10): 2*1000 -27*100 +529=2000 -2700 +529= (2000+529)=2529-2700= -171.\n\nf(11): 2*1331 -27*121 +529=2662 -3267 +529= (2662+529)=3191 -3267= -76.\n\nf(12): 2*1728 -27*144 +529=3456 -3888 +529= (3456+529)=3985 -3888=97.\n\nSo between k=11 and k=12, f(k) goes from -76 to +97, so there is a root between 11 and 12. Let me try k=11.5:\n\nf(11.5)=2*(11.5)^3 -27*(11.5)^2 +529.\n\nFirst, 11.5 cubed: 11.5*11.5=132.25, then *11.5=132.25*10 +132.25*1.5=1322.5 +198.375=1520.875. So 2*1520.875=3041.75.\n\n27*(11.5)^2=27*132.25=27*(130 +2.25)=27*130=3510 +27*2.25=60.75 \u21d2 total 3510+60.75=3570.75.\n\nThus f(11.5)=3041.75 -3570.75 +529= (3041.75 -3570.75)= -529 +529=0. Wait, that's exactly zero!\n\nWait, 11.5 cubed is (23/2)^3= (23)^3/(8)=12167/8\u22481520.875, which is correct. Then 2*(12167/8)=12167/4\u22483041.75.\n\nThen 27*(11.5)^2: (23/2)^2=529/4, so 27*(529/4)= (27/4)*529= (27*529)/4. 27*529= let's see 27*500=13500, 27*29=783, so total 13500+783=14283. Then 14283/4=3570.75. So 3041.75 -3570.75= -529. Then adding 529 gives 0. So indeed, k=11.5 is a root!\n\nTherefore, k=11.5=23/2. So, that's a rational root. Therefore, we can factor the cubic as (k -23/2)(quadratic). Let me perform polynomial division.\n\nDivide 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529 by (k -23/2). Let me write the cubic as 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +0k +529. Dividing by (k -23/2).\n\nAlternatively, let me write 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529 = (k -23/2)(Ak\u00b2 + Bk + C). Let me multiply out the RHS:\n\n(k -23/2)(Ak\u00b2 + Bk + C) = Ak\u00b3 + Bk\u00b2 + Ck - (23/2)Ak\u00b2 - (23/2)Bk - (23/2)C\n\n= Ak\u00b3 + (B - (23/2)A)k\u00b2 + (C - (23/2)B)k - (23/2)C.\n\nSet equal to LHS: 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +0k +529.\n\nTherefore, equate coefficients:\n\nA =2,\n\nB - (23/2)A = -27 \u21d2 B -23 = -27 \u21d2 B= -4,\n\nC - (23/2)B =0 \u21d2 C - (23/2)(-4)=0 \u21d2 C +46=0 \u21d2 C= -46,\n\n- (23/2)C =529 \u21d2 - (23/2)(-46)= (23*46)/2. Let me compute 23*46: 20*46=920, 3*46=138, total 1058. Then 1058/2=529. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (k -23/2)(2k\u00b2 -4k -46). Let me check the quadratic: 2k\u00b2 -4k -46. Let me see if that factors further. The discriminant is 16 + 368=384. sqrt(384)=sqrt(64*6)=8\u221a6\u224819.5959. So roots at [4 \u00b18\u221a6]/4= [1 \u00b12\u221a6]. So the quadratic has roots at k=(1 +2\u221a6) and k=(1 -2\u221a6). The latter is negative, so since k=ab must be positive, the only real positive roots are k=23/2 and k=(1 +2\u221a6). Wait, but 1 +2\u221a6\u22481+4.899\u22485.899, but let's see.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation 2k\u00b2 -4k -46=0 has roots:\n\nk = [4 \u00b1\u221a(16 + 368)]/(4) = [4 \u00b1\u221a384]/4 = [4 \u00b1 8\u221a6]/4 = [1 \u00b12\u221a6]/1. Wait, no, sqrt(384)=sqrt(64*6)=8\u221a6, so yes. So roots are (4 +8\u221a6)/4 =1 +2\u221a6 and (4 -8\u221a6)/4=1 -2\u221a6. The second is negative, so the only positive roots are k=23/2 and k=1+2\u221a6\u22485.898.\n\nTherefore, the cubic equation 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529=0 has roots at k=23/2\u224811.5, and k\u22485.898.\n\nTherefore, the critical points for S(k) are at k=23/2 and k=1+2\u221a6\u22485.898. Wait, but how does this relate to the minimization?\n\nWe need to check which of these critical points gives the minimal S. Since we are looking for a minimum, we can evaluate S at these critical points.\n\nFirst, let's compute S at k=23/2=11.5. Then, from the expression S(k)= (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k.\n\nPlugging in k=11.5:\n\nFirst term: (27*(23/2) - (23/2)^2)/23\n\n= ( (621/2) - (529/4) ) /23\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n= (1242/4 -529/4)/23 = (713/4)/23 = 713/(4*23)= 713/92\u22487.75.\n\nSecond term:23/k=23/(23/2)=2.\n\nTherefore total S=7.75 +2=9.75. Wait, that's the same as when we set a=b=2 earlier. So that critical point gives S=9.75.\n\nNow let's check the other critical point at k\u22485.898. Let me compute k=1+2\u221a6\u22481 +4.899\u22485.899.\n\nSo k=1+2\u221a6. Let me compute S(k):\n\nFirst term: (27k -k\u00b2)/23.\n\nLet me compute numerator:27k -k\u00b2.\n\nLet me note that k=1+2\u221a6, so let me compute k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 = (1)^2 + 4\u221a6 + (2\u221a6)^2=1 +4\u221a6 +24=25 +4\u221a6.\n\nThus, 27k -k\u00b2 =27*(1 +2\u221a6) - (25 +4\u221a6)\n\n=27 +54\u221a6 -25 -4\u221a6\n\n= (27-25) + (54\u221a6 -4\u221a6)\n\n=2 +50\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, first term: (2 +50\u221a6)/23.\n\nSecond term:23/k=23/(1+2\u221a6). Let me rationalize denominator:\n\n23/(1+2\u221a6) * (1 -2\u221a6)/(1 -2\u221a6)=23*(1 -2\u221a6)/(1 -24)=23*(1 -2\u221a6)/(-23)= - (1 -2\u221a6)=2\u221a6 -1.\n\nTherefore, second term is 2\u221a6 -1.\n\nThus total S(k)= [2 +50\u221a6]/23 +2\u221a6 -1.\n\nLet me combine terms:\n\nFirst term: [2 +50\u221a6]/23,\n\nSecond term: (2\u221a6 -1).\n\nLet me write everything over 23:\n\n= [2 +50\u221a6 +23*(2\u221a6 -1)] /23\n\nCompute 23*(2\u221a6 -1)=46\u221a6 -23,\n\nThus numerator:\n\n2 +50\u221a6 +46\u221a6 -23 = (2-23) + (50\u221a6 +46\u221a6)= -21 +96\u221a6.\n\nTherefore S(k)= (-21 +96\u221a6)/23.\n\nLet me compute this numerically:\n\n\u221a6\u22482.449,\n\n96*2.449\u224896*2.4=230.4 +96*0.049\u2248230.4 +4.704\u2248235.104,\n\nThen -21 +235.104\u2248214.104,\n\nDivide by 23\u2248214.104/23\u22489.309.\n\nWhich matches the approximate value we had earlier (~9.31). Therefore, this critical point gives a lower S.\n\nNow, we need to check whether this is indeed a minimum. Let me see the behavior of S(k).\n\nLooking back at the derivative S\u2019(k)= (27-2k)/23 -23/k\u00b2.\n\nWhen k approaches 0+, the term -23/k\u00b2 dominates, so S\u2019(k) approaches -infty.\n\nAt k=5.899 (~k=1+2\u221a6), S\u2019(k)=0,\n\nAt k=11.5, S\u2019(k)=0,\n\nAnd as k approaches infinity, the term (27-2k)/23 dominates, so S\u2019(k) approaches -infinity.\n\nTherefore, the critical point at k\u22485.899 is a local minimum, and the one at k\u224811.5 is a local maximum. Wait, how?\n\nWait, let's check the second derivative maybe? Alternatively, testing intervals.\n\nFor k between 0 and 5.899: Let me pick k=5, which is less than 5.899.\n\nCompute S\u2019(5)= (27 -10)/23 -23/25\u224817/23\u22480.739 -0.92\u2248-0.181. Hmm, negative?\n\nWait, 27 -2*5=17, so first term is 17/23\u22480.739, second term is 23/25\u22480.92, so 0.739 -0.92\u2248-0.181. Negative.\n\nAt k=6 (still less than 5.899? Wait 6 is more than 5.899). Wait 5.899 is approx 5.9, so 6 is higher. Let me pick k=5.5:\n\nS\u2019(5.5)= (27-11)/23 -23/(5.5)^2=16/23\u22480.695 -23/(30.25)\u22480.695 -0.76\u2248-0.065.\n\nStill negative.\n\nAt k=5.899 (critical point), derivative is zero.\n\nAt k=10:\n\nS\u2019(10)= (27-20)/23 -23/100\u22487/23\u22480.304 -0.23\u22480.074. Positive.\n\nAt k=12:\n\nS\u2019(12)= (27-24)/23 -23/144\u22483/23\u22480.13 -0.16\u2248-0.03.\n\nWait, so between k=10 and k=12, the derivative goes from +0.074 to -0.03, so crosses zero at k=11.5 (which is the other critical point). So, the derivative is positive between 5.899 and 11.5, and negative outside. So the critical point at k\u22485.899 is a local minimum, and at k=11.5 is a local maximum. Therefore, the minimal S occurs at k=1+2\u221a6, which gives S\u22489.309, and the maximum at k=11.5 gives S=9.75.\n\nTherefore, the minimal S is S_min = (-21 +96\u221a6)/23. Wait, but let me confirm that expression again:\n\nEarlier, we had S(k)= [ -21 +96\u221a6 ] /23. Let me verify the steps again:\n\nYes, when we computed S(k)= [2 +50\u221a6]/23 +2\u221a6 -1,\n\nthen converting to a common denominator:\n\n[2 +50\u221a6 +23*(2\u221a6 -1)] /23\n\n= [2 +50\u221a6 +46\u221a6 -23]/23\n\n= [ (2-23) + (50\u221a6 +46\u221a6) ] /23\n\n= [ -21 +96\u221a6 ] /23. Correct.\n\nTherefore, S_min = (-21 +96\u221a6)/23. Therefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -54. Wait, no. Wait, S is x+y+z. So x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(xy + yz +xz)=S\u00b2 -2*27=S\u00b2-54. Therefore, the value we need is (S\u00b2 -54)/4.\n\nTherefore, compute S\u00b2 first:\n\nLet me compute S = (-21 +96\u221a6)/23,\n\nSo S\u00b2 = [ (-21 +96\u221a6)^2 ] / (23)^2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n(-21 +96\u221a6)^2 = (-21)^2 + (96\u221a6)^2 + 2*(-21)(96\u221a6)\n\n= 441 + 96\u00b2*(6) + 2*(-21)(96\u221a6)\n\nFirst term:441,\n\nSecond term: 96\u00b2=9216, so 9216*6=55296,\n\nThird term: 2*(-21)(96\u221a6)= -42*96\u221a6= -4032\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, numerator is 441 +55296 -4032\u221a6 =55737 -4032\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -54 = (55737 -4032\u221a6)/23\u00b2 -54.\n\nWait, but 23\u00b2 is 529. So:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = [55737 -4032\u221a6]/529 -54.\n\nConvert 54 to over 529: 54=54*529/529=28566/529.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (55737 -4032\u221a6 -28566)/529\n\n= (55737 -28566 -4032\u221a6)/529\n\nCalculate 55737-28566:\n\n55737 -28566: 55737 -28000=27737, then subtract 566: 27737-566=27171.\n\nSo numerator is 27171 -4032\u221a6.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nThus, r\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4 = (27171 -4032\u221a6)/(4*529).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, let me check S\u00b2 again. Wait, S is equal to ( -21 +96\u221a6 ) /23. Therefore, S squared is [(-21)^2 + (96\u221a6)^2 + 2*(-21)(96\u221a6)] divided by 23 squared, which is 529.\n\nYes, so:\n\n(-21)^2 =441,\n\n(96\u221a6)^2=96\u00b2*6= 9216*6=55296,\n\nCross term: 2*(-21)*(96\u221a6)= -4032\u221a6,\n\nSo numerator is 441 +55296 -4032\u221a6 =55737 -4032\u221a6.\n\nThen, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -54,\n\nSo S\u00b2 is (55737 -4032\u221a6)/529,\n\nMinus 54: 54 is 54/1,\n\nSo converting to common denominator:\n\n54 =54*(529)/529 =28566/529,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (55737 -4032\u221a6 -28566)/529 = (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nHmm, so that is the expression for x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, r squared is (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4 = (27171 -4032\u221a6)/(4*529).\n\nBut this still has a radical, which complicates things. Wait, but the problem says that r\u00b2 can be written as p/q, so maybe there's an error here because I expected it to be a rational number? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal sphere must contain the box regardless of its orientation. Wait, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". Wait, so each box in B must fit inside the sphere. The minimal such sphere would have a radius equal to the maximum over all boxes in B of (space diagonal)/2. Wait, but the problem states \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". Therefore, the radius must be at least the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. Therefore, to find the minimal such sphere, we need to find the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B, then take that as r. Then, r\u00b2 would be (max space diagonal squared)/4.\n\nTherefore, actually, maybe I was wrong earlier. The problem is to find the minimal sphere that can contain every box in B, so the radius must be at least as big as the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B divided by 2. Therefore, the minimal r is the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. Therefore, we need to find the maximum of sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/2 over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, and then take the square of that maximum, which would be (max(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2))/4. Therefore, actually, we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given the constraints, not minimize. Wait, that's a critical point I missed.\n\nOh no, that's a big mistake. I thought we had to minimize the sphere, so maybe I confused the problem. Let me read again.\n\n\"The value of r^2 can be written as p/q, where p and q are relatively prime positive integers. Find p+q.\"\n\nWait, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So the sphere must contain all the boxes in B. Therefore, the sphere must be large enough to contain every box in B. Therefore, the radius must be at least the maximum of the space diagonals of all boxes in B divided by 2. Therefore, the minimal such r is equal to the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. Therefore, to find r^2, we need to compute ( (max space diagonal)^2 ) /4. So, actually, we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 over all boxes in B, then divide by 4.\n\nOh my, so I had it backwards earlier. I thought to minimize the sum, but actually, the radius depends on the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, so we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2. That changes everything.\n\nSo, going back, we have to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that xy + yz + xz =27 and xyz=23. So, with this corrected understanding, let's proceed.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz) = S\u00b2 -54, where S =x+y+z. Therefore, to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, we need to maximize S\u00b2. Since S\u00b2 is being maximized, so S is maximized or minimized? Since S\u00b2 is a square, the maximum could be at either the maximum or minimum of S. However, given that S is positive, the maximum of S\u00b2 would correspond to the maximum of S, since S can't be negative. Therefore, to maximize S\u00b2, we need to maximize S. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of S =x + y + z given the constraints.\n\nTherefore, now the problem is to maximize S =x + y + z with xy + yz + xz =27 and xyz=23.\n\nHmm, okay, so now we need to find the maximum possible S given those constraints. Let's see.\n\nAgain, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers, but this time aiming to maximize S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps similar to before, but now looking for maximum S.\n\nAlternatively, again, assuming variables equal or not.\n\nLet me consider the earlier approach where we set variables in terms of k =ab. Wait, but now with the goal to maximize S.\n\nEarlier, we had S(k)= (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k. To maximize S, let's analyze this function.\n\nWe had critical points at k=23/2 (11.5) and k\u22485.899. Previously, at k=11.5, S was 9.75, which was a local maximum, and at k\u22485.899, it was a local minimum. Therefore, the maximum S occurs at k=23/2, which gives S=9.75. So, this would be the maximal S.\n\nWait, so if that's the case, then the maximum x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is S_max\u00b2 -54 = (9.75)^2 -54.\n\nCompute 9.75 squared: 9.75^2 = (9 + 0.75)^2 =81 + 2*9*0.75 +0.75\u00b2 =81 +13.5 +0.5625=95.0625. Subtract 54 gives 41.0625. Therefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=41.0625. Thus, r\u00b2=41.0625/4=10.265625. Which is 164.0625/16? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, 41.0625 divided by 4 is 10.265625. Let me express that as a fraction.\n\n41.0625 is equal to 41 + 0.0625=41 +1/16= (41*16 +1)/16= (656 +1)/16=657/16.\n\nTherefore, r\u00b2= (657/16)/4=657/(16*4)=657/64.\n\nCheck if 657 and 64 are coprime. 657 divided by 3 is 219, so 657=3*219=3*3*73. 64 is 2^6. No common factors, so 657/64 is reduced. Therefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=721.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if this is indeed the maximum.\n\nEarlier, when I assumed x=y=2, then z=23/(2*2)=23/4=5.75. The sum S=2+2+5.75=9.75, which is exactly the value at the critical point k=ab=4 (since a=2, b=2, so k=4). Wait, but earlier when I considered the function S(k), the critical point at k=11.5 gives S=9.75, but here with k=4 (ab=4), we get S=9.75 as well. Wait, that can't be.\n\nWait, hold on, there is confusion here. Let me retrace.\n\nEarlier, when I set x=y=2, then ab=2*2=4, so k=4. However, in the expression for S(k)= (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k,\n\nAt k=4,\n\nS(k)= (27*4 -16)/23 +23/4 = (108-16)/23 +23/4= 92/23 +23/4=4 +5.75=9.75. So that's correct. But when we found critical points for the derivative, we found critical points at k=23/2 (11.5) and k=1+2\u221a6\u22485.899. Therefore, at k=4, which is between 5.899 and 11.5? Wait, 4 is less than 5.899. Hmm, so that's in the region where the function S(k) is decreasing?\n\nWait, but at k=4, which is less than 5.899, which was the local minimum. Wait, but the critical point at k\u22485.899 is a local minimum, so S(k) is decreasing from k=0 up to k\u22485.899, then increasing from there to k=11.5, then decreasing again beyond. Therefore, the maximum of S(k) occurs at either k approaching 0, k approaching infinity, or at the local maximum at k=11.5.\n\nWait, but when k approaches 0, S(k)= (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k. The term 23/k goes to infinity, so S(k) approaches infinity? Wait, but k=ab, and since xyz=23, if k approaches zero, then z=23/(ab) would approach infinity, so the variables can't all stay positive with finite S. Wait, actually, if ab approaches zero, then z=23/(ab) approaches infinity, so S =a +b + z would approach infinity. But subject to the constraint that xy + yz +xz =27.\n\nWait, but if a and b approach zero, then ab approaches zero, but then z becomes very large. Let me see if such a box can satisfy xy + yz + xz =27.\n\nSuppose a and b approach zero, then terms xy and xz and yz:\n\nxy =ab approaches 0,\n\nxz =a*z =a*(23/(ab))=23/b,\n\nSimilarly yz =23/a.\n\nTherefore, xy + yz + xz \u2248 23/a +23/b.\n\nTo have this equal to 27, we need 23/a +23/b \u224827. If a and b are approaching zero, but such that 23/a +23/b is fixed at 27, that would require that a and b are of certain orders. For instance, if a approaches zero and b is proportional to 23/(something). However, this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum S is indeed at k=11.5, giving S=9.75, which is the local maximum. Since for k beyond 11.5, S(k) would start decreasing again. Wait, when k approaches infinity, S(k)= (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k \u2248 -k\u00b2/23, which tends to negative infinity. But since k is positive, but variables must stay positive. However, if k approaches infinity, then ab is very large, so z=23/(ab) approaches zero. Then, the surface area terms: xy=ab ~k, yz\u2248b*0=0, xz\u2248a*0=0, so xy + yz +xz \u2248k =27. So to have xy + yz +xz=27, if k approaches infinity, that can't happen. So actually, the domain of k is constrained such that the variables remain positive and satisfy the surface area equation.\n\nTherefore, the maximum S occurs at the local maximum at k=11.5, giving S=9.75, which corresponds to the case when a=b=2, z=5.75. So that's a valid box, and that gives the maximum S. So, therefore, the maximal x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is 9.75\u00b2 -54= 95.0625 -54=41.0625=657/16, so r squared is that divided by 4, so 657/64, which gives p+q=657+64=721.\n\nBut hold on, earlier when I considered the case where variables were not equal (the case with k\u22485.899), which gave a lower S, but since we are to find the maximum S, that case is irrelevant.\n\nWait, but let me check another case. Suppose we have a very skewed box where one side is very long and the other two are small. For instance, let me suppose x approaches sqrt(23), y approaches 1, then z approaches 23/(x*y). Let me see if that can satisfy the surface area.\n\nWait, let me try x approaching sqrt(23), y approaching 0, then z would be 23/(x*y), which would go to infinity. Then surface area would be xy + yz +xz\u22480 + (y*inf) + (x*inf). Hmm, but that's problematic. Alternatively, maybe take an example where one variable is large, another is small.\n\nAlternatively, let's try x=1, then find y and z such that xyz=23 and xy + yz +xz=27. So with x=1,\n\nThen, y*z=23,\n\nand y + z + y z =27.\n\nWait, substituting z=23/y,\n\nSo y +23/y +23 =27,\n\nThus, y +23/y =4,\n\nMultiply by y: y\u00b2 +23 =4y,\n\ny\u00b2 -4y +23=0,\n\nDiscriminant:16 -92= -76 <0, so no real solutions. So x=1 is impossible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there is a lower bound on variables.\n\nAlternatively, take x=3, then y*z=23/3\u22487.6667,\n\nSurface area equation: 3y +3z + y z=27.\n\nLet me set z=23/(3y). Substitute:\n\n3y +3*(23/(3y)) + y*(23/(3y))=27,\n\nSimplify:\n\n3y +23/y +23/3 =27,\n\nMultiply all terms by 3y to eliminate denominators:\n\n9y\u00b2 +69 +23y =81y,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n9y\u00b2 +23y +69 -81y=0,\n\n9y\u00b2 -58y +69=0,\n\nDiscriminant: 58\u00b2 -4*9*69=3364 -2484=880,\n\nsqrt(880)=sqrt(16*55)=4\u221a55\u22484*7.416\u224829.664,\n\nThus y=(58 \u00b129.664)/18,\n\nTaking positive root:\n\n(58 +29.664)/18\u224887.664/18\u22484.87,\n\nThus y\u22484.87, z=23/(3*4.87)\u224823/14.6\u22481.575.\n\nThen S=3 +4.87 +1.575\u22489.445, which is less than 9.75. So that gives a smaller S.\n\nTherefore, the maximum S indeed seems to be 9.75.\n\nTherefore, the maximum space diagonal squared is 41.0625, so r squared is 41.0625/4=10.265625=657/64.\n\nWait, 657 divided by 64: 64*10=640, so 657-640=17, so 657/64=10 +17/64. Yes, and 17 and 64 are coprime. So p=657, q=64, sum is 657+64=721.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 721. But wait, let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, let me check when x=y=2, z=23/4:\n\nCompute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=4 +4 + (529/16)=8 +33.0625=41.0625, which is 657/16. Then r squared is that divided by 4, so (657/16)/4=657/64. Yes. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 657 +64=721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this math problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, and then express that as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p+q. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a rectangular box has three dimensions: length, width, and height. Let's call them x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz), and the volume is xyz. The problem states that the surface area is 54 and the volume is 23. So, we have two equations:\n\n1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \u21d2 xy + yz + xz = 27\n2. xyz = 23\n\nWe need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius of such a sphere would be half of the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere has to contain the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the minimal radius r would be (1/2) times the space diagonal. The space diagonal of a box with sides x, y, z is \u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). So, r = (\u221a(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2))/2. Therefore, r\u00b2 would be (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4. So, our goal is to find the minimal possible value of (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4 given the constraints on surface area and volume. Therefore, we need to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that xy + yz + xz = 27 and xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, so the problem reduces to minimizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 with the given constraints. Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe using Lagrange multipliers? But since it's a problem with symmetric variables, perhaps there is a way to express x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 in terms of the given equations?\n\nWait, I recall that (x + y + z)\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + 2(xy + yz + xz). Since we know that xy + yz + xz = 27, so if we can find x + y + z, then we can get x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2. Let me denote S = x + y + z, then x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2*27 = S\u00b2 - 54. Therefore, we need to minimize S\u00b2 - 54, so equivalently minimize S\u00b2. Therefore, the problem reduces to minimizing (x + y + z)^2 given the constraints on the surface area and volume.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can express variables in terms of each other. Since xyz = 23, perhaps set variables in terms of some parameters? Hmm, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps assuming symmetry? Maybe the minimal diagonal occurs when the box is as \"balanced\" as possible, like a cube? But since the volume is 23, which is not a perfect cube, so maybe not. But perhaps the minimal diagonal occurs when two sides are equal? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, since the problem is about minimizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, given the constraints, perhaps using the method of Lagrange multipliers with two constraints?\n\nLet me try that. Let me denote the function to minimize as f(x, y, z) = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nThe constraints are:\n\ng(x, y, z) = xy + yz + xz - 27 = 0,\n\nh(x, y, z) = xyz - 23 = 0.\n\nSo, we can set up the Lagrangian:\n\nL = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - \u03bb(xy + yz + xz - 27) - \u03bc(xyz - 23).\n\nTaking partial derivatives with respect to x, y, z, and set them to zero.\n\nCompute \u2202L/\u2202x = 2x - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc(yz) = 0,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202y = 2y - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc(xz) = 0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202z = 2z - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc(xy) = 0.\n\nHmm, so that gives three equations. Also, we have the two constraints:\n\nxy + yz + xz = 27,\n\nxyz = 23.\n\nThis seems a system of five equations with five variables (x, y, z, \u03bb, \u03bc). Solving this might be tricky, but perhaps there is some symmetry here. Let me see if x = y = z is possible. If that were the case, then we could set x = y = z. Let me check if that works.\n\nSuppose x = y = z. Then, the volume would be x\u00b3 = 23 \u21d2 x = \u221b23 \u2248 2.843. The surface area would be 6x\u00b2 = 6*(\u221b23)^2. Let me compute that: 6*(23^(2/3)). Let me see, 23^(1/3) is approximately 2.843, so squared is about 8.08, so 6*8.08 \u2248 48.5, but the problem states that the surface area must be 54, which is higher. So, that suggests that a cube with volume 23 has a smaller surface area than required here. Therefore, the actual boxes in set B must have a larger surface area, so they can't be cubes. Therefore, the minimal sphere might not be achieved by a cube. So, symmetry is broken here.\n\nHmm, so maybe two variables are equal? Let me suppose that two variables are equal, say x = y. Let me try that. Let x = y, then we can write equations in terms of x and z.\n\nLet me set x = y. Then, the volume becomes x\u00b2 z = 23,\n\nSurface area: 2(x\u00b2 + 2xz) = 54 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + 2xz = 27.\n\nSo, from the volume equation, z = 23/(x\u00b2). Substitute into the surface area equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + 2x*(23/(x\u00b2)) = 27 \u21d2 x\u00b2 + (46/x) = 27.\n\nMultiply both sides by x to eliminate denominator:\n\nx\u00b3 + 46 = 27x \u21d2 x\u00b3 -27x +46 =0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me see if there's an integer root. Let me try x=2: 8 - 54 +46 = 0. 8 -54 is -46 +46 is 0. So x=2 is a root. Therefore, (x -2) is a factor. Let's factor the cubic:\n\nx\u00b3 -27x +46 = (x -2)(x\u00b2 + 2x -23). Let me check: (x -2)(x\u00b2 + 2x -23) = x\u00b3 + 2x\u00b2 -23x -2x\u00b2 -4x +46 = x\u00b3 -27x +46. Correct.\n\nSo the other roots are solutions to x\u00b2 +2x -23=0, which would be x = [-2 \u00b1\u221a(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1\u221a96]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4\u221a6]/2 = -1 \u00b12\u221a6. Since x must be positive, only x = -1 +2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 +4.899 \u22483.899. So the roots are x=2 and x\u22483.899.\n\nSo, if x = y =2, then z =23/(2\u00b2)=23/4 =5.75. Let me check surface area:\n\n2(xy + yz +xz) =2(4 + 2*5.75 +2*5.75)=2(4 +11.5 +11.5)=2*(27)=54. Correct. So that's valid.\n\nThe other solution is x\u22483.899, so then z=23/(x\u00b2). Let me compute that. But since x is a real solution, maybe that's another critical point. However, since we need to minimize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, perhaps the minimal occurs at x=2, or at the other critical point?\n\nWait, but we need to check both possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's compute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 when x=y=2, z=23/4.\n\nThen, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 4 +4 + (23/4)^2. Let's compute that:\n\n(23/4)^2 is (529)/16 \u224833.0625, so total is 8 + 33.0625 \u224841.0625. Therefore, r\u00b2 would be that divided by 4, so approx 10.265625.\n\nAlternatively, if we take the other critical point where x = y = -1 +2\u221a6. Let me compute that value numerically. Let me compute x \u2248-1 + 2*2.449 \u2248-1 +4.898\u22483.898. So, x \u22483.898, so z =23/(x\u00b2). Let me compute x squared: (3.898)^2\u224815.19, so z\u224823/15.19\u22481.515. Then, compute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 2*(3.898)^2 + (1.515)^2\u22482*(15.19)+2.295\u224830.38+2.295\u224832.675. Therefore, r\u00b2\u224832.675/4\u22488.16875. That's smaller. So, that would be better. Therefore, the minimal might be at that other critical point.\n\nHmm, so perhaps that is the minimal. But since I found this by assuming x=y, but maybe the true minimal occurs when all variables are different? So maybe this approach is not sufficient. Hmm. Maybe I should proceed with the Lagrangian equations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can parametrize variables in terms of two variables. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using substitution. Let me think.\n\nWe have two equations: xy + yz + xz =27 and xyz=23.\n\nLet me consider variables x, y, z. Let me denote variables as a, b, c for simplicity. Let me think of them as roots of a cubic equation. Let me suppose that x, y, z are roots of the equation t\u00b3 - St\u00b2 + Pt - Q =0, where S =x+y+z, P=xy+yz+xz=27, Q=xyz=23. So the cubic equation would be t\u00b3 - S t\u00b2 +27 t -23=0.\n\nTherefore, if we can find S, then we can get x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -54. So our goal is to find the minimal possible S\u00b2 -54, so minimal S\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the minimal possible value of S\u00b2 given that the cubic equation t\u00b3 - S t\u00b2 +27 t -23=0 has three positive real roots. Hmm, that might be another approach. To find the minimal S such that this cubic has three positive real roots.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using inequalities. Since we need to minimize S\u00b2, so S, so we need to minimize S. Wait, but is S necessarily minimized when variables are arranged in a certain way?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the AM \u2265 GM inequality, but since we have constraints, maybe that's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, let me think about the cubic equation. Let me denote the cubic as f(t)=t\u00b3 - S t\u00b2 +27 t -23. To have three real positive roots, the cubic must satisfy certain conditions. The discriminant must be non-negative, and the function must cross the t-axis three times in the positive reals.\n\nThe discriminant D of a cubic equation at\u00b3 + bt\u00b2 + ct +d is given by D = 18abcd -4b\u00b3d + b\u00b2c\u00b2 - 4ac\u00b3 -27a^4d\u00b2. But here a=1, so D = 18*1*(-S)*27*(-23) -4*(-S)^3*(-23) + (-S)^2*(27)^2 -4*1*(27)^3 -27*(1)^2*(-23)^2.\n\nHmm, this might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe using calculus. The cubic must have a local maximum and minimum, and the function must cross the t-axis three times. Therefore, the derivative f\u2019(t)=3t\u00b2 - 2S t +27 must have two real roots, so discriminant must be positive. The discriminant of f\u2019 is (2S)^2 -4*3*27 =4S\u00b2 - 324. So 4S\u00b2 -324 >0 \u21d2 S\u00b2 >81 \u21d2 |S|>9. Since S is positive (sum of positive roots), so S>9.\n\nSo S must be greater than 9. Therefore, the minimal possible S is just over 9. But can S actually attain 9? Let me check if S=9 is possible.\n\nIf S=9, then the cubic equation is t\u00b3 -9t\u00b2 +27t -23=0. Let me see if this cubic has three real roots. Let me compute f(1)=1 -9 +27 -23= -4. f(2)=8 -36 +54 -23= -7. f(3)=27 -81 +81 -23=5. f(4)=64 - 144 +108 -23=5. Hmm, f(1)= -4, f(2)= -7, f(3)=5, so there is a root between 2 and 3. Also, as t approaches infinity, f(t) goes to infinity, and as t approaches negative infinity, it goes to negative infinity, but since all roots are positive, maybe only one positive root? Wait, but if S=9, the cubic is t\u00b3 -9t\u00b2 +27t -23. Let me check at t=0, f(0)= -23. At t=1, -4, t=2, -7, t=3, +5. So crossing from negative to positive between 2 and 3. Also, after t=3, it's positive? Let me check t=4: 64 - 144 + 108 -23= (64+108) - (144+23)=172 -167=5. So positive. Then, since it's a cubic, maybe only one real root? Wait, but the derivative at S=9 would have discriminant 4*(9)^2 - 324 = 324 - 324=0. So the derivative has a double root. So the cubic has a point of inflection. So in that case, maybe only one real root? Hmm. Therefore, S=9 is not possible because the cubic would have a multiple root and only one real root. Therefore, S must be greater than 9. So the minimal S is just over 9, but how do we find the minimal S?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the method of substitution. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider that we have xyz=23 and xy + yz + xz=27. Let me try to express variables in terms of two variables. Let me set variables as x, y, and z=23/(xy). Then, substitute into the surface area equation:\n\nxy + y*(23/(xy)) + x*(23/(xy)) =27.\n\nSimplify:\n\nxy + 23/x +23/y =27.\n\nHmm, so that's an equation in x and y. Let me denote a =x, b=y. So:\n\nab + 23/a +23/b =27.\n\nWe need to find the minimal S =a + b + 23/(ab). Wait, no, S =x + y + z = a + b +23/(ab).\n\nSo our goal is to minimize S = a + b + 23/(ab) with the constraint ab +23/a +23/b =27.\n\nThis seems complicated, but maybe set variables such that a = b? Let me try that. Let me suppose a = b. Then, the equation becomes:\n\na\u00b2 + 2*(23/a) =27 \u21d2 a\u00b2 + 46/a =27.\n\nMultiply by a: a\u00b3 +46 =27a \u21d2a\u00b3 -27a +46=0. Wait, that's the same equation as before when I set x=y. So that's how we got the roots at a=2 and a\u22483.899. So when a=2, then S=2+2 +23/(4)=4 +5.75=9.75. When a\u22483.899, then S\u22483.899 +3.899 +23/(3.899^2). Let me compute that:\n\n3.899 squared is approx (3.9)^2 =15.21, so 23/15.21\u22481.513. Then total S\u22483.899*2 +1.513\u22487.798 +1.513\u22489.311. So that's lower than 9.75. So that is better. So, that suggests that when a and b are equal to that value (~3.899), the sum S is lower. But since S must be greater than 9, that's approaching 9.31, which is still above 9.\n\nBut is that the minimal? Or can we get even lower?\n\nAlternatively, maybe not setting a = b. Let me see. Let me think of variables a and b such that they are different. Maybe using calculus here.\n\nLet me consider the equation ab +23/a +23/b =27. Let me denote that as equation (1). We need to minimize S = a + b +23/(ab). Let me try to write S in terms of ab.\n\nLet me denote ab = k. Then, equation (1) becomes k +23(1/a +1/b)=27. Hmm, but 1/a +1/b = (a + b)/ab. Let me denote s =a + b, then 1/a +1/b = s/k. Therefore equation (1):\n\nk +23*(s/k)=27.\n\nSo, equation (1) can be rewritten as:\n\nk + (23 s)/k =27 \u21d2k\u00b2 +23 s =27k \u21d223 s =27k -k\u00b2 \u21d2 s= (27k -k\u00b2)/23.\n\nOur goal is to minimize S = s +23/(k). Substitute s from above:\n\nS = (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k.\n\nTherefore, S(k) = (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k.\n\nSo now, S is expressed solely in terms of k. We can now treat this as a function of k and find its minimum. Let me compute derivative of S with respect to k:\n\nS\u2019(k) = (27 - 2k)/23 -23/k\u00b2.\n\nSet derivative to zero:\n\n(27 - 2k)/23 -23/k\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 (27 -2k)/23 =23/k\u00b2 \u21d2 Multiply both sides by 23k\u00b2:\n\n(27 -2k)k\u00b2 =23\u00b2 \u21d227k\u00b2 -2k\u00b3 =529 \u21d22k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529 =0.\n\nHmm, so now we have a cubic equation: 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529=0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me check for rational roots. Possible rational roots are factors of 529 over factors of 2. 529 is 23 squared, so factors are \u00b11, \u00b123, \u00b1529, etc. divided by 1 or 2. Let me try k=23: 2*(23)^3 -27*(23)^2 +529. 23^3 is 12167, so 2*12167=24334, 27*529=14283, so 24334 -27*529 +529=24334 -27*529 +529=24334 -26*529. 26*529=13754, so 24334-13754=10580. Not zero. Hmm, k= something else.\n\nWait, perhaps k is not an integer. Let me see if I can approximate the root. Let me let f(k)=2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529.\n\nCompute f(9): 2*729 -27*81 +529=1458 -2187 +529= (1458+529)=1987 -2187= -200.\n\nf(10): 2*1000 -27*100 +529=2000 -2700 +529= (2000+529)=2529-2700= -171.\n\nf(11): 2*1331 -27*121 +529=2662 -3267 +529= (2662+529)=3191 -3267= -76.\n\nf(12): 2*1728 -27*144 +529=3456 -3888 +529= (3456+529)=3985 -3888=97.\n\nSo between k=11 and k=12, f(k) goes from -76 to +97, so there is a root between 11 and 12. Let me try k=11.5:\n\nf(11.5)=2*(11.5)^3 -27*(11.5)^2 +529.\n\nFirst, 11.5 cubed: 11.5*11.5=132.25, then *11.5=132.25*10 +132.25*1.5=1322.5 +198.375=1520.875. So 2*1520.875=3041.75.\n\n27*(11.5)^2=27*132.25=27*(130 +2.25)=27*130=3510 +27*2.25=60.75 \u21d2 total 3510+60.75=3570.75.\n\nThus f(11.5)=3041.75 -3570.75 +529= (3041.75 -3570.75)= -529 +529=0. Wait, that's exactly zero!\n\nWait, 11.5 cubed is (23/2)^3= (23)^3/(8)=12167/8\u22481520.875, which is correct. Then 2*(12167/8)=12167/4\u22483041.75.\n\nThen 27*(11.5)^2: (23/2)^2=529/4, so 27*(529/4)= (27/4)*529= (27*529)/4. 27*529= let's see 27*500=13500, 27*29=783, so total 13500+783=14283. Then 14283/4=3570.75. So 3041.75 -3570.75= -529. Then adding 529 gives 0. So indeed, k=11.5 is a root!\n\nTherefore, k=11.5=23/2. So, that's a rational root. Therefore, we can factor the cubic as (k -23/2)(quadratic). Let me perform polynomial division.\n\nDivide 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529 by (k -23/2). Let me write the cubic as 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +0k +529. Dividing by (k -23/2).\n\nAlternatively, let me write 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529 = (k -23/2)(Ak\u00b2 + Bk + C). Let me multiply out the RHS:\n\n(k -23/2)(Ak\u00b2 + Bk + C) = Ak\u00b3 + Bk\u00b2 + Ck - (23/2)Ak\u00b2 - (23/2)Bk - (23/2)C\n\n= Ak\u00b3 + (B - (23/2)A)k\u00b2 + (C - (23/2)B)k - (23/2)C.\n\nSet equal to LHS: 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +0k +529.\n\nTherefore, equate coefficients:\n\nA =2,\n\nB - (23/2)A = -27 \u21d2 B -23 = -27 \u21d2 B= -4,\n\nC - (23/2)B =0 \u21d2 C - (23/2)(-4)=0 \u21d2 C +46=0 \u21d2 C= -46,\n\n- (23/2)C =529 \u21d2 - (23/2)(-46)= (23*46)/2. Let me compute 23*46: 20*46=920, 3*46=138, total 1058. Then 1058/2=529. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the cubic factors as (k -23/2)(2k\u00b2 -4k -46). Let me check the quadratic: 2k\u00b2 -4k -46. Let me see if that factors further. The discriminant is 16 + 368=384. sqrt(384)=sqrt(64*6)=8\u221a6\u224819.5959. So roots at [4 \u00b18\u221a6]/4= [1 \u00b12\u221a6]. So the quadratic has roots at k=(1 +2\u221a6) and k=(1 -2\u221a6). The latter is negative, so since k=ab must be positive, the only real positive roots are k=23/2 and k=(1 +2\u221a6). Wait, but 1 +2\u221a6\u22481+4.899\u22485.899, but let's see.\n\nWait, the quadratic equation 2k\u00b2 -4k -46=0 has roots:\n\nk = [4 \u00b1\u221a(16 + 368)]/(4) = [4 \u00b1\u221a384]/4 = [4 \u00b1 8\u221a6]/4 = [1 \u00b12\u221a6]/1. Wait, no, sqrt(384)=sqrt(64*6)=8\u221a6, so yes. So roots are (4 +8\u221a6)/4 =1 +2\u221a6 and (4 -8\u221a6)/4=1 -2\u221a6. The second is negative, so the only positive roots are k=23/2 and k=1+2\u221a6\u22485.898.\n\nTherefore, the cubic equation 2k\u00b3 -27k\u00b2 +529=0 has roots at k=23/2\u224811.5, and k\u22485.898.\n\nTherefore, the critical points for S(k) are at k=23/2 and k=1+2\u221a6\u22485.898. Wait, but how does this relate to the minimization?\n\nWe need to check which of these critical points gives the minimal S. Since we are looking for a minimum, we can evaluate S at these critical points.\n\nFirst, let's compute S at k=23/2=11.5. Then, from the expression S(k)= (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k.\n\nPlugging in k=11.5:\n\nFirst term: (27*(23/2) - (23/2)^2)/23\n\n= ( (621/2) - (529/4) ) /23\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n= (1242/4 -529/4)/23 = (713/4)/23 = 713/(4*23)= 713/92\u22487.75.\n\nSecond term:23/k=23/(23/2)=2.\n\nTherefore total S=7.75 +2=9.75. Wait, that's the same as when we set a=b=2 earlier. So that critical point gives S=9.75.\n\nNow let's check the other critical point at k\u22485.898. Let me compute k=1+2\u221a6\u22481 +4.899\u22485.899.\n\nSo k=1+2\u221a6. Let me compute S(k):\n\nFirst term: (27k -k\u00b2)/23.\n\nLet me compute numerator:27k -k\u00b2.\n\nLet me note that k=1+2\u221a6, so let me compute k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 = (1)^2 + 4\u221a6 + (2\u221a6)^2=1 +4\u221a6 +24=25 +4\u221a6.\n\nThus, 27k -k\u00b2 =27*(1 +2\u221a6) - (25 +4\u221a6)\n\n=27 +54\u221a6 -25 -4\u221a6\n\n= (27-25) + (54\u221a6 -4\u221a6)\n\n=2 +50\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, first term: (2 +50\u221a6)/23.\n\nSecond term:23/k=23/(1+2\u221a6). Let me rationalize denominator:\n\n23/(1+2\u221a6) * (1 -2\u221a6)/(1 -2\u221a6)=23*(1 -2\u221a6)/(1 -24)=23*(1 -2\u221a6)/(-23)= - (1 -2\u221a6)=2\u221a6 -1.\n\nTherefore, second term is 2\u221a6 -1.\n\nThus total S(k)= [2 +50\u221a6]/23 +2\u221a6 -1.\n\nLet me combine terms:\n\nFirst term: [2 +50\u221a6]/23,\n\nSecond term: (2\u221a6 -1).\n\nLet me write everything over 23:\n\n= [2 +50\u221a6 +23*(2\u221a6 -1)] /23\n\nCompute 23*(2\u221a6 -1)=46\u221a6 -23,\n\nThus numerator:\n\n2 +50\u221a6 +46\u221a6 -23 = (2-23) + (50\u221a6 +46\u221a6)= -21 +96\u221a6.\n\nTherefore S(k)= (-21 +96\u221a6)/23.\n\nLet me compute this numerically:\n\n\u221a6\u22482.449,\n\n96*2.449\u224896*2.4=230.4 +96*0.049\u2248230.4 +4.704\u2248235.104,\n\nThen -21 +235.104\u2248214.104,\n\nDivide by 23\u2248214.104/23\u22489.309.\n\nWhich matches the approximate value we had earlier (~9.31). Therefore, this critical point gives a lower S.\n\nNow, we need to check whether this is indeed a minimum. Let me see the behavior of S(k).\n\nLooking back at the derivative S\u2019(k)= (27-2k)/23 -23/k\u00b2.\n\nWhen k approaches 0+, the term -23/k\u00b2 dominates, so S\u2019(k) approaches -infty.\n\nAt k=5.899 (~k=1+2\u221a6), S\u2019(k)=0,\n\nAt k=11.5, S\u2019(k)=0,\n\nAnd as k approaches infinity, the term (27-2k)/23 dominates, so S\u2019(k) approaches -infinity.\n\nTherefore, the critical point at k\u22485.899 is a local minimum, and the one at k\u224811.5 is a local maximum. Wait, how?\n\nWait, let's check the second derivative maybe? Alternatively, testing intervals.\n\nFor k between 0 and 5.899: Let me pick k=5, which is less than 5.899.\n\nCompute S\u2019(5)= (27 -10)/23 -23/25\u224817/23\u22480.739 -0.92\u2248-0.181. Hmm, negative?\n\nWait, 27 -2*5=17, so first term is 17/23\u22480.739, second term is 23/25\u22480.92, so 0.739 -0.92\u2248-0.181. Negative.\n\nAt k=6 (still less than 5.899? Wait 6 is more than 5.899). Wait 5.899 is approx 5.9, so 6 is higher. Let me pick k=5.5:\n\nS\u2019(5.5)= (27-11)/23 -23/(5.5)^2=16/23\u22480.695 -23/(30.25)\u22480.695 -0.76\u2248-0.065.\n\nStill negative.\n\nAt k=5.899 (critical point), derivative is zero.\n\nAt k=10:\n\nS\u2019(10)= (27-20)/23 -23/100\u22487/23\u22480.304 -0.23\u22480.074. Positive.\n\nAt k=12:\n\nS\u2019(12)= (27-24)/23 -23/144\u22483/23\u22480.13 -0.16\u2248-0.03.\n\nWait, so between k=10 and k=12, the derivative goes from +0.074 to -0.03, so crosses zero at k=11.5 (which is the other critical point). So, the derivative is positive between 5.899 and 11.5, and negative outside. So the critical point at k\u22485.899 is a local minimum, and at k=11.5 is a local maximum. Therefore, the minimal S occurs at k=1+2\u221a6, which gives S\u22489.309, and the maximum at k=11.5 gives S=9.75.\n\nTherefore, the minimal S is S_min = (-21 +96\u221a6)/23. Wait, but let me confirm that expression again:\n\nEarlier, we had S(k)= [ -21 +96\u221a6 ] /23. Let me verify the steps again:\n\nYes, when we computed S(k)= [2 +50\u221a6]/23 +2\u221a6 -1,\n\nthen converting to a common denominator:\n\n[2 +50\u221a6 +23*(2\u221a6 -1)] /23\n\n= [2 +50\u221a6 +46\u221a6 -23]/23\n\n= [ (2-23) + (50\u221a6 +46\u221a6) ] /23\n\n= [ -21 +96\u221a6 ] /23. Correct.\n\nTherefore, S_min = (-21 +96\u221a6)/23. Therefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -54. Wait, no. Wait, S is x+y+z. So x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 - 2(xy + yz +xz)=S\u00b2 -2*27=S\u00b2-54. Therefore, the value we need is (S\u00b2 -54)/4.\n\nTherefore, compute S\u00b2 first:\n\nLet me compute S = (-21 +96\u221a6)/23,\n\nSo S\u00b2 = [ (-21 +96\u221a6)^2 ] / (23)^2.\n\nCompute numerator:\n\n(-21 +96\u221a6)^2 = (-21)^2 + (96\u221a6)^2 + 2*(-21)(96\u221a6)\n\n= 441 + 96\u00b2*(6) + 2*(-21)(96\u221a6)\n\nFirst term:441,\n\nSecond term: 96\u00b2=9216, so 9216*6=55296,\n\nThird term: 2*(-21)(96\u221a6)= -42*96\u221a6= -4032\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, numerator is 441 +55296 -4032\u221a6 =55737 -4032\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -54 = (55737 -4032\u221a6)/23\u00b2 -54.\n\nWait, but 23\u00b2 is 529. So:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = [55737 -4032\u221a6]/529 -54.\n\nConvert 54 to over 529: 54=54*529/529=28566/529.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (55737 -4032\u221a6 -28566)/529\n\n= (55737 -28566 -4032\u221a6)/529\n\nCalculate 55737-28566:\n\n55737 -28566: 55737 -28000=27737, then subtract 566: 27737-566=27171.\n\nSo numerator is 27171 -4032\u221a6.\n\nTherefore,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nThus, r\u00b2 = (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4 = (27171 -4032\u221a6)/(4*529).\n\nHmm, this seems complicated. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation here. Let me retrace.\n\nWait, let me check S\u00b2 again. Wait, S is equal to ( -21 +96\u221a6 ) /23. Therefore, S squared is [(-21)^2 + (96\u221a6)^2 + 2*(-21)(96\u221a6)] divided by 23 squared, which is 529.\n\nYes, so:\n\n(-21)^2 =441,\n\n(96\u221a6)^2=96\u00b2*6= 9216*6=55296,\n\nCross term: 2*(-21)*(96\u221a6)= -4032\u221a6,\n\nSo numerator is 441 +55296 -4032\u221a6 =55737 -4032\u221a6.\n\nThen, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = S\u00b2 -54,\n\nSo S\u00b2 is (55737 -4032\u221a6)/529,\n\nMinus 54: 54 is 54/1,\n\nSo converting to common denominator:\n\n54 =54*(529)/529 =28566/529,\n\nThus,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (55737 -4032\u221a6 -28566)/529 = (27171 -4032\u221a6)/529.\n\nHmm, so that is the expression for x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, r squared is (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/4 = (27171 -4032\u221a6)/(4*529).\n\nBut this still has a radical, which complicates things. Wait, but the problem says that r\u00b2 can be written as p/q, so maybe there's an error here because I expected it to be a rational number? Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the minimal sphere must contain the box regardless of its orientation. Wait, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". Wait, so each box in B must fit inside the sphere. The minimal such sphere would have a radius equal to the maximum over all boxes in B of (space diagonal)/2. Wait, but the problem states \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". Therefore, the radius must be at least the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. Therefore, to find the minimal such sphere, we need to find the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B, then take that as r. Then, r\u00b2 would be (max space diagonal squared)/4.\n\nTherefore, actually, maybe I was wrong earlier. The problem is to find the minimal sphere that can contain every box in B, so the radius must be at least as big as the maximum space diagonal over all boxes in B divided by 2. Therefore, the minimal r is the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. Therefore, we need to find the maximum of sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2)/2 over all boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, and then take the square of that maximum, which would be (max(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2))/4. Therefore, actually, we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given the constraints, not minimize. Wait, that's a critical point I missed.\n\nOh no, that's a big mistake. I thought we had to minimize the sphere, so maybe I confused the problem. Let me read again.\n\n\"The value of r^2 can be written as p/q, where p and q are relatively prime positive integers. Find p+q.\"\n\nWait, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So the sphere must contain all the boxes in B. Therefore, the sphere must be large enough to contain every box in B. Therefore, the radius must be at least the maximum of the space diagonals of all boxes in B divided by 2. Therefore, the minimal such r is equal to the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. Therefore, to find r^2, we need to compute ( (max space diagonal)^2 ) /4. So, actually, we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 over all boxes in B, then divide by 4.\n\nOh my, so I had it backwards earlier. I thought to minimize the sum, but actually, the radius depends on the maximum possible space diagonal among all boxes in B, so we need to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2. That changes everything.\n\nSo, going back, we have to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 given that xy + yz + xz =27 and xyz=23. So, with this corrected understanding, let's proceed.\n\nSo, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz) = S\u00b2 -54, where S =x+y+z. Therefore, to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, we need to maximize S\u00b2. Since S\u00b2 is being maximized, so S is maximized or minimized? Since S\u00b2 is a square, the maximum could be at either the maximum or minimum of S. However, given that S is positive, the maximum of S\u00b2 would correspond to the maximum of S, since S can't be negative. Therefore, to maximize S\u00b2, we need to maximize S. Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible value of S =x + y + z given the constraints.\n\nTherefore, now the problem is to maximize S =x + y + z with xy + yz + xz =27 and xyz=23.\n\nHmm, okay, so now we need to find the maximum possible S given those constraints. Let's see.\n\nAgain, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers, but this time aiming to maximize S.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps similar to before, but now looking for maximum S.\n\nAlternatively, again, assuming variables equal or not.\n\nLet me consider the earlier approach where we set variables in terms of k =ab. Wait, but now with the goal to maximize S.\n\nEarlier, we had S(k)= (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k. To maximize S, let's analyze this function.\n\nWe had critical points at k=23/2 (11.5) and k\u22485.899. Previously, at k=11.5, S was 9.75, which was a local maximum, and at k\u22485.899, it was a local minimum. Therefore, the maximum S occurs at k=23/2, which gives S=9.75. So, this would be the maximal S.\n\nWait, so if that's the case, then the maximum x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is S_max\u00b2 -54 = (9.75)^2 -54.\n\nCompute 9.75 squared: 9.75^2 = (9 + 0.75)^2 =81 + 2*9*0.75 +0.75\u00b2 =81 +13.5 +0.5625=95.0625. Subtract 54 gives 41.0625. Therefore, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=41.0625. Thus, r\u00b2=41.0625/4=10.265625. Which is 164.0625/16? Wait, let me see:\n\nWait, 41.0625 divided by 4 is 10.265625. Let me express that as a fraction.\n\n41.0625 is equal to 41 + 0.0625=41 +1/16= (41*16 +1)/16= (656 +1)/16=657/16.\n\nTherefore, r\u00b2= (657/16)/4=657/(16*4)=657/64.\n\nCheck if 657 and 64 are coprime. 657 divided by 3 is 219, so 657=3*219=3*3*73. 64 is 2^6. No common factors, so 657/64 is reduced. Therefore, p=657, q=64, so p+q=721.\n\nWait, but let me confirm if this is indeed the maximum.\n\nEarlier, when I assumed x=y=2, then z=23/(2*2)=23/4=5.75. The sum S=2+2+5.75=9.75, which is exactly the value at the critical point k=ab=4 (since a=2, b=2, so k=4). Wait, but earlier when I considered the function S(k), the critical point at k=11.5 gives S=9.75, but here with k=4 (ab=4), we get S=9.75 as well. Wait, that can't be.\n\nWait, hold on, there is confusion here. Let me retrace.\n\nEarlier, when I set x=y=2, then ab=2*2=4, so k=4. However, in the expression for S(k)= (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k,\n\nAt k=4,\n\nS(k)= (27*4 -16)/23 +23/4 = (108-16)/23 +23/4= 92/23 +23/4=4 +5.75=9.75. So that's correct. But when we found critical points for the derivative, we found critical points at k=23/2 (11.5) and k=1+2\u221a6\u22485.899. Therefore, at k=4, which is between 5.899 and 11.5? Wait, 4 is less than 5.899. Hmm, so that's in the region where the function S(k) is decreasing?\n\nWait, but at k=4, which is less than 5.899, which was the local minimum. Wait, but the critical point at k\u22485.899 is a local minimum, so S(k) is decreasing from k=0 up to k\u22485.899, then increasing from there to k=11.5, then decreasing again beyond. Therefore, the maximum of S(k) occurs at either k approaching 0, k approaching infinity, or at the local maximum at k=11.5.\n\nWait, but when k approaches 0, S(k)= (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k. The term 23/k goes to infinity, so S(k) approaches infinity? Wait, but k=ab, and since xyz=23, if k approaches zero, then z=23/(ab) would approach infinity, so the variables can't all stay positive with finite S. Wait, actually, if ab approaches zero, then z=23/(ab) approaches infinity, so S =a +b + z would approach infinity. But subject to the constraint that xy + yz +xz =27.\n\nWait, but if a and b approach zero, then ab approaches zero, but then z becomes very large. Let me see if such a box can satisfy xy + yz + xz =27.\n\nSuppose a and b approach zero, then terms xy and xz and yz:\n\nxy =ab approaches 0,\n\nxz =a*z =a*(23/(ab))=23/b,\n\nSimilarly yz =23/a.\n\nTherefore, xy + yz + xz \u2248 23/a +23/b.\n\nTo have this equal to 27, we need 23/a +23/b \u224827. If a and b are approaching zero, but such that 23/a +23/b is fixed at 27, that would require that a and b are of certain orders. For instance, if a approaches zero and b is proportional to 23/(something). However, this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum S is indeed at k=11.5, giving S=9.75, which is the local maximum. Since for k beyond 11.5, S(k) would start decreasing again. Wait, when k approaches infinity, S(k)= (27k -k\u00b2)/23 +23/k \u2248 -k\u00b2/23, which tends to negative infinity. But since k is positive, but variables must stay positive. However, if k approaches infinity, then ab is very large, so z=23/(ab) approaches zero. Then, the surface area terms: xy=ab ~k, yz\u2248b*0=0, xz\u2248a*0=0, so xy + yz +xz \u2248k =27. So to have xy + yz +xz=27, if k approaches infinity, that can't happen. So actually, the domain of k is constrained such that the variables remain positive and satisfy the surface area equation.\n\nTherefore, the maximum S occurs at the local maximum at k=11.5, giving S=9.75, which corresponds to the case when a=b=2, z=5.75. So that's a valid box, and that gives the maximum S. So, therefore, the maximal x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is 9.75\u00b2 -54= 95.0625 -54=41.0625=657/16, so r squared is that divided by 4, so 657/64, which gives p+q=657+64=721.\n\nBut hold on, earlier when I considered the case where variables were not equal (the case with k\u22485.899), which gave a lower S, but since we are to find the maximum S, that case is irrelevant.\n\nWait, but let me check another case. Suppose we have a very skewed box where one side is very long and the other two are small. For instance, let me suppose x approaches sqrt(23), y approaches 1, then z approaches 23/(x*y). Let me see if that can satisfy the surface area.\n\nWait, let me try x approaching sqrt(23), y approaching 0, then z would be 23/(x*y), which would go to infinity. Then surface area would be xy + yz +xz\u22480 + (y*inf) + (x*inf). Hmm, but that's problematic. Alternatively, maybe take an example where one variable is large, another is small.\n\nAlternatively, let's try x=1, then find y and z such that xyz=23 and xy + yz +xz=27. So with x=1,\n\nThen, y*z=23,\n\nand y + z + y z =27.\n\nWait, substituting z=23/y,\n\nSo y +23/y +23 =27,\n\nThus, y +23/y =4,\n\nMultiply by y: y\u00b2 +23 =4y,\n\ny\u00b2 -4y +23=0,\n\nDiscriminant:16 -92= -76 <0, so no real solutions. So x=1 is impossible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps there is a lower bound on variables.\n\nAlternatively, take x=3, then y*z=23/3\u22487.6667,\n\nSurface area equation: 3y +3z + y z=27.\n\nLet me set z=23/(3y). Substitute:\n\n3y +3*(23/(3y)) + y*(23/(3y))=27,\n\nSimplify:\n\n3y +23/y +23/3 =27,\n\nMultiply all terms by 3y to eliminate denominators:\n\n9y\u00b2 +69 +23y =81y,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n9y\u00b2 +23y +69 -81y=0,\n\n9y\u00b2 -58y +69=0,\n\nDiscriminant: 58\u00b2 -4*9*69=3364 -2484=880,\n\nsqrt(880)=sqrt(16*55)=4\u221a55\u22484*7.416\u224829.664,\n\nThus y=(58 \u00b129.664)/18,\n\nTaking positive root:\n\n(58 +29.664)/18\u224887.664/18\u22484.87,\n\nThus y\u22484.87, z=23/(3*4.87)\u224823/14.6\u22481.575.\n\nThen S=3 +4.87 +1.575\u22489.445, which is less than 9.75. So that gives a smaller S.\n\nTherefore, the maximum S indeed seems to be 9.75.\n\nTherefore, the maximum space diagonal squared is 41.0625, so r squared is 41.0625/4=10.265625=657/64.\n\nWait, 657 divided by 64: 64*10=640, so 657-640=17, so 657/64=10 +17/64. Yes, and 17 and 64 are coprime. So p=657, q=64, sum is 657+64=721.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 721. But wait, let me confirm once more.\n\nWait, let me check when x=y=2, z=23/4:\n\nCompute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2=4 +4 + (529/16)=8 +33.0625=41.0625, which is 657/16. Then r squared is that divided by 4, so (657/16)/4=657/64. Yes. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 657 +64=721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n\n\nGiven a set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes, expressed as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\) where \\(p\\) and \\(q\\) are coprime positive integers, and then find \\(p + q\\).\n\n1. **Constraints and Equations**:\n   - Surface area: \\(2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \\implies xy + yz + xz = 27\\)\n   - Volume: \\(xyz = 23\\)\n   - The radius \\(r\\) of the smallest sphere containing the box is half the space diagonal, so \\(r^2 = \\frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{4}\\).\n\n2. **Objective**:\n   - Maximize \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\) given the constraints. This is equivalent to maximizing \\((x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz)\\), since \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + xz)\\).\n\n3. **Maximizing \\(x + y + z\\)**:\n   - Let \\(S = x + y + z\\). We need to maximize \\(S\\).\n   - Using Lagrange multipliers and substitution methods, we find critical points. Setting \\(x = y\\) leads to solving the cubic equation \\(x^3 - 27x + 46 = 0\\), yielding roots \\(x = 2\\) and \\(x \\approx 3.899\\).\n   - For \\(x = y = 2\\), \\(z = \\frac{23}{4}\\), we get \\(S = 2 + 2 + \\frac{23}{4} = 9.75\\).\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The critical point analysis shows that \\(S = 9.75\\) is the maximum value, corresponding to \\(x = 2\\), \\(y = 2\\), and \\(z = \\frac{23}{4}\\).\n   - Calculating \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\): \n     \\[\n     2^2 + 2^2 + \\left(\\frac{23}{4}\\right)^2 = 4 + 4 + \\frac{529}{16} = \\frac{657}{16}\n     \\]\n   - Thus, \\(r^2 = \\frac{657}{16 \\times 4} = \\frac{657}{64}\\).\n\n5. **Result**:\n   - The fraction \\(\\frac{657}{64}\\) has \\(p = 657\\) and \\(q = 64\\), which are coprime. Therefore, \\(p + q = 657 + 64 = 721\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{721}\n\\]",
