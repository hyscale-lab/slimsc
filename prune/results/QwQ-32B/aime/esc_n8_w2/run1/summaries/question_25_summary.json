      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the items they own. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand all the details. \n\nThere are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are owned by everyone. Then there are three other items: diamond rings (195 owners), golf clubs (367 owners), and garden spades (562 owners). Additionally, it's given that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of these things. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items. \n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for multiple sets. Since all residents own the candy hearts, that might simplify things because the candy hearts are a common item. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's note that since everyone owns candy hearts, the total number of people owning any of the other three items (diamond, golf clubs, garden spade) plus those who don't own any of the other three would still be 900. But since everyone has at least the candy hearts, maybe the problem is structured such that the other items are optional? Wait, actually, the problem states \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts,\" so candy hearts are universal. The other items are owned by subsets. \n\nThe problem mentions that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But since candy hearts are owned by everyone, when they say \"exactly two of these things,\" that could mean exactly two items including the candy hearts or not? Wait, actually, since everyone owns candy hearts, the \"exactly two\" must refer to exactly two items in addition to the candy hearts? Or is the candy hearts considered as one of the items?\n\nWait, the wording says \"the last line of your response should be your integer answer within \\boxed{}.\" Let me check again:\n\nThe problem states: \"Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.\"\n\nSo \"these things\" includes the candy hearts. Therefore, when they say someone owns exactly two of these things, it's two items including the candy hearts. But since everyone owns candy hearts, the only way someone could own exactly two items is if they own the candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three. Wait, but that would mean \"exactly two of these things\" would be candy hearts plus one other, so exactly two total. Similarly, \"exactly three of these things\" would be candy hearts plus two others, so three total. And \"all four\" would be candy hearts plus all three of the others. \n\nTherefore, the problem is structured with four items: candy hearts (everyone has), diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), garden spades (562). \n\nThe counts given are:\n\n- Total residents: 900.\n\n- Number owning exactly two items (including candy hearts): 437.\n\n- Number owning exactly three items (including candy hearts): 234.\n\n- We need to find the number owning all four items (so candy hearts plus the other three).\n\nHmm, okay. So we need to use inclusion-exclusion here. Let me think about how to model this. Let me denote the sets as follows:\n\nLet C be the set of people who own candy hearts. Since everyone is in C, |C| = 900.\n\nLet D be the set of people who own a diamond ring: |D| = 195.\n\nG for golf clubs: |G| = 367.\n\nS for garden spades: |S| = 562.\n\nWe need to find |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|. But since everyone is in C, this is just |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nWait, actually, since all residents are in C, the intersections with C are redundant. So the problem reduces to finding |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|, since C is the universal set here.\n\nTherefore, perhaps it's better to consider the problem in terms of the three items D, G, S, with the universal set being all 900 people (since everyone has C). So the problem is really about the three sets D, G, S within the universal set of 900 people. However, the counts given involve exactly two and exactly three items, which include the candy hearts. Wait, but since everyone has candy hearts, the counts of exactly two items would be those who have C plus exactly one of D, G, S. Similarly, exactly three items would be C plus two of D, G, S, and exactly four items would be C plus all three of D, G, S. \n\nTherefore, the problem is structured so that:\n\n- The number of people with exactly two items (including C) is equal to the number of people who have C plus exactly one of D, G, S. Since C is everyone, this is the same as the number of people who are in exactly one of D, G, S. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, exactly two items: since everyone has C, the two items must be C and one other. So the count of exactly two items is the number of people in exactly one of D, G, S. Wait, but actually, the \"two items\" would be C plus one of D, G, S, so that's exactly two items. Similarly, exactly three items would be C plus two of the others, so that's three items total. Exactly four items would be C plus all three of D, G, S. \n\nTherefore, the problem can be rephrased as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define the three sets D, G, S with universe 900. The problem states that the number of people in exactly one of D, G, S is 437 (since exactly two items total, which are C and one other). The number of people in exactly two of D, G, S is 234 (since exactly three items total: C plus two others). The number of people in all three D, G, S is what we need to find, since that would be the ones with all four items (including C).\n\nAdditionally, the total number of people is 900. Also, the total in D is 195, G is 367, S is 562. \n\nTherefore, perhaps we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets. Let me recall the formula:\n\nThe total number of people in at least one of D, G, S is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut we also know that the total number of people in exactly one set plus exactly two sets plus exactly three sets equals |D \u222a G \u222a S|. Since everyone is in C, but D, G, S might not cover everyone. Wait, but actually, the problem doesn't state that everyone has at least one of D, G, S. Wait, but the counts given are 437 (exactly two items, which would be exactly one of D, G, S) plus 234 (exactly three items, which would be exactly two of D, G, S) plus the number of people with all three (so exactly four items, which is exactly three of D, G, S) plus the people who have none of D, G, S (so only C). Therefore, the total is:\n\nNumber with exactly 1 of DGS (i.e., exactly two items total) = 437\n\nNumber with exactly 2 of DGS (exactly three items total) = 234\n\nNumber with exactly 3 of DGS (exactly four items total) = x (the answer we need)\n\nNumber with 0 of DGS (only C) = ?\n\nTotal must be 900. So:\n\n437 + 234 + x + (number with none of DGS) = 900\n\nBut we don't know the number with none of DGS yet. Alternatively, perhaps we can express the total in D \u222a G \u222a S as (437 + 234 + x). Therefore:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x\n\nTherefore, the number of people with none of D, G, S is 900 - (671 + x) = 229 - x.\n\nNow, using inclusion-exclusion for |D \u222a G \u222a S|:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nWe can write that as:\n\n671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nWait, let me compute the sum of |D| + |G| + |S| first: 195 + 367 + 562.\n\n195 + 367 = 562, and then +562 gives 1124. Wait, 195+367 is 562? Let me check:\n\n195 + 367: 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. Yes. Then 562 + 562 is 1124. So that's the sum.\n\nSo:\n\n671 + x = 1124 - (sum of pairwise intersections) + (triple intersection)\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet a = |D \u2229 G|,\n\nb = |D \u2229 S|,\n\nc = |G \u2229 S|,\n\nand d = |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| (which is the x we need to find, since that's the number with all three of DGS, i.e., all four items including C).\n\nWait, actually, yes, because |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is exactly the number of people who have all four items (since they have D, G, S, and C). So d = x.\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n671 + x = 1124 - (a + b + c) + x\n\nWait, hold on, substituting d with x? Wait, the formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - (a + b + c) + d\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n671 + x = 1124 - (a + b + c) + x\n\nWait, so if I subtract 1124 from both sides:\n\n671 + x - 1124 = - (a + b + c) + x\n\nThen, 671 - 1124 = - (a + b + c)\n\nSo, (671 - 1124) = - (a + b + c)\n\nTherefore, (a + b + c) = 1124 - 671 = 453\n\nHmm, so the sum of the pairwise intersections is 453. But how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need another equation. Let me think about how the numbers of people in exactly one, two, or three sets relate to the intersections.\n\nThe number of people in exactly one set is 437. That can be written as:\n\n(|D| - (a + b - d) - ... Wait, perhaps better to recall the standard breakdown:\n\nThe number of people in exactly one set is:\n\n|D| + |G| + |S| - 2*(a + b + c) + 3*d\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me recall:\n\nThe formula for exactly one set is:\n\n(|D| - (a + b - d)) + (|G| - (a + c - d)) + (|S| - (b + c - d)) ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of inclusion-exclusion components.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula is:\n\nNumber of exactly one = |D| + |G| + |S| - 2*(a + b + c) + 3*d ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think of it as:\n\nEach of the pairwise intersections a, b, c includes the triple intersection d. So, for example:\n\nThe number of people in exactly D and G but not S is a - d,\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nTherefore, the number of people in exactly two sets would be (a - d) + (b - d) + (c - d) = (a + b + c) - 3d.\n\nSimilarly, the number in exactly one set would be:\n\n(|D| - (a + b - d)) + (|G| - (a + c - d)) + (|S| - (b + c - d))\n\nWait, let me do it step by step.\n\nThe number in exactly D only is |D| - (number in D and G) - (number in D and S) + (number in all three). Wait, no:\n\nWait, the formula for exactly D is:\n\n|D| - (those in D and G) - (those in D and S) + (those in all three). Because when you subtract the pairwise intersections, you subtracted the triple intersection twice, so you have to add it back once.\n\nWait, actually, let me recall:\n\nThe number of elements only in D is |D| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|. Wait, no, actually, if you subtract the intersections, you have:\n\n|D| - (number in D and G) - (number in D and S) + (number in D and G and S). Because when you subtract D \u2229 G and D \u2229 S, you subtracted the triple intersection twice, so you add it back once.\n\nWait, actually, let me think of it as:\n\nThe count for exactly D is |D| minus those in D and another set. So:\n\nExactly D = |D| - (number in D \u2229 G + D \u2229 S - D \u2229 G \u2229 S). Because D \u2229 G includes those also in S, and D \u2229 S also includes those in all three, so when subtracting both, you subtract the triple intersection twice, so you need to add it back once.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe an easier way is:\n\nTotal in exactly one set = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2*(a + b + c) + 3*d\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nEach person in exactly one set is counted once in |D|, |G|, or |S|. \n\nEach person in exactly two sets is counted twice in the sum |D|+|G|+|S|, so to get the count for exactly one, we subtract 2*(sum of pairwise intersections). But the pairwise intersections include the triple overlaps. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula for exactly one is:\n\nExactly one = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2*(|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + 3*(|D \u2229 G \u2229 S|)\n\nLet me check with a simple example. Suppose all three sets are the same, so |D|=|G|=|S|=n, and all intersections are n. Then exactly one would be 0, and the formula would give n + n + n - 2*(n + n + n) + 3n = 3n -6n +3n =0, which works.\n\nAnother example: suppose D, G, S are pairwise disjoint except for the triple intersection. Then |D \u2229 G|=|D \u2229 S|=|G \u2229 S|=d, and |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|=d. Then exactly one would be |D| + |G| + |S| - 2*(d + d + d) + 3*d = (|D|+|G|+|S|) - 6d +3d = (sum) -3d. But in reality, exactly one would be (|D| - 2d) + (|G| -2d) + (|S| -2d) )? Wait no. If all pairwise overlaps are exactly d (the triple), then the exactly one count is (|D| - d) + (|G| - d) + (|S| - d) ) = (sum) - 3d. Which matches the formula. So yes, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula for exactly one is:\n\nExactly one = |D| + |G| + |S| - 2(a + b + c) + 3d.\n\nSimilarly, exactly two is:\n\nEach exactly two count is (a - d) + (b - d) + (c - d) = (a + b + c) - 3d.\n\nAnd exactly three is d.\n\nGiven that, let's plug in the known values.\n\nWe have:\n\nExactly one = 437 = (195 + 367 + 562) - 2*(a + b + c) + 3d\n\nExactly two = 234 = (a + b + c) - 3d\n\nExactly three = d = x (the answer we need)\n\nWe already found from the inclusion-exclusion earlier that:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 671 + x = 1124 - (a + b + c) + d\n\nWait, but maybe we can use the equations from exactly one and exactly two first.\n\nLet me note that:\n\nEquation 1: 437 = (195 + 367 + 562) - 2*(a + b + c) + 3d\n\nCompute 195+367+562: 195+367 is 562, then +562 gives 1124. So:\n\n437 = 1124 - 2*(a + b + c) + 3d\n\nEquation 2: 234 = (a + b + c) - 3d\n\nSo let me denote S = a + b + c. Then Equation 2 gives S = 234 + 3d.\n\nPlugging S into Equation 1:\n\n437 = 1124 - 2*(234 + 3d) + 3d\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\n437 = 1124 - 2*234 - 2*(3d) + 3d\n\nCompute 2*234 = 468, and 2*(3d) is 6d:\n\n437 = 1124 - 468 -6d +3d\n\nSimplify constants: 1124 - 468 = 656\n\nSo:\n\n437 = 656 - 3d\n\nNow, subtract 656 from both sides:\n\n437 - 656 = -3d\n\nWhich is -219 = -3d \u2192 d = 73.\n\nWait, so d = 73? Let me check the arithmetic again.\n\nWait, 437 = 1124 - 2*(a + b + c) + 3d.\n\nBut since a + b + c = 234 + 3d,\n\nthen substituting:\n\n437 = 1124 - 2*(234 + 3d) + 3d\n\nCompute 2*(234 + 3d) = 468 + 6d,\n\nso,\n\n437 = 1124 - 468 -6d +3d,\n\nso,\n\n437 = (1124 - 468) + (-6d +3d),\n\n1124 -468: Let me compute 1124 - 400 = 724, then -68 more gives 656.\n\nThus 656 - 3d = 437,\n\nSo 656 -437 = 3d,\n\n656 - 437: 656 -400=256, then -37 more is 219.\n\nSo 219 = 3d \u2192 d = 73. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo d = 73. Therefore, the number of people who own all four items is 73. Let me check if this makes sense with the other equations.\n\nLet me check Equation 2: 234 = (a + b + c) - 3d,\n\nsince d=73, then a + b + c =234 + 3*73 =234 +219=453.\n\nEarlier, when we did the inclusion-exclusion, we had:\n\nFrom |D \u222a G \u222a S|=671 +x (since x is d=73, so that would be 671 +73=744)\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Wait, the total in the union is exactly one (437) + exactly two (234) + exactly three (73) = 437 +234=671 +73=744.\n\nThen the inclusion-exclusion formula says:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S|= |D|+|G|+|S| - (a + b + c) + d = 1124 -453 +73.\n\nCompute that: 1124 -453 = 671, plus 73 gives 744. Which matches. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the calculations check out.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 73. Let me just make sure there are no other constraints or possible mistakes.\n\nWait, the problem states that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the total number of people not in D, G, or S is 900 - |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 -744=156. That's okay, since they would only have candy hearts, which is allowed.\n\nIs there any other condition I might have missed? The problem didn't mention anything else, so I think this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nGiven the problem of finding the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items (diamond ring, set of golf clubs, garden spade, and bag of candy hearts), we start by noting that every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Therefore, we only need to consider the intersections of the sets of residents owning the other three items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S).\n\nWe are given:\n- Total residents: 900\n- Residents owning exactly two items (including candy hearts): 437 (which translates to exactly one of D, G, S)\n- Residents owning exactly three items (including candy hearts): 234 (which translates to exactly two of D, G, S)\n- We need to find the number of residents owning all three of D, G, S (which translates to all four items including candy hearts).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets D, G, and S, we denote:\n- \\( |D| = 195 \\)\n- \\( |G| = 367 \\)\n- \\( |S| = 562 \\)\n- \\( a = |D \\cap G| \\)\n- \\( b = |D \\cap S| \\)\n- \\( c = |G \\cap S| \\)\n- \\( d = |D \\cap G \\cap S| \\) (the value we need to find)\n\nThe number of residents in exactly one of the sets D, G, S is given by:\n\\[\n437 = |D| + |G| + |S| - 2(a + b + c) + 3d\n\\]\nThe number of residents in exactly two of the sets D, G, S is given by:\n\\[\n234 = (a + b + c) - 3d\n\\]\n\nWe solve these equations step-by-step.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the residents of Aimeville and the items they own. Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand all the details. \n\nThere are 900 residents in total. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So, candy hearts are owned by everyone. Then there are three other items: diamond rings (195 owners), golf clubs (367 owners), and garden spades (562 owners). Additionally, it's given that 437 residents own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three of these things. The question is asking for the number of residents who own all four items. \n\nHmm, okay. Let me recall the principle of inclusion-exclusion for multiple sets. Since all residents own the candy hearts, that might simplify things because the candy hearts are a common item. Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's note that since everyone owns candy hearts, the total number of people owning any of the other three items (diamond, golf clubs, garden spade) plus those who don't own any of the other three would still be 900. But since everyone has at least the candy hearts, maybe the problem is structured such that the other items are optional? Wait, actually, the problem states \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts,\" so candy hearts are universal. The other items are owned by subsets. \n\nThe problem mentions that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. But since candy hearts are owned by everyone, when they say \"exactly two of these things,\" that could mean exactly two items including the candy hearts or not? Wait, actually, since everyone owns candy hearts, the \"exactly two\" must refer to exactly two items in addition to the candy hearts? Or is the candy hearts considered as one of the items?\n\nWait, the wording says \"the last line of your response should be your integer answer within \\boxed{}.\" Let me check again:\n\nThe problem states: \"Among the 900 residents of Aimeville, there are 195 who own a diamond ring, 367 who own a set of golf clubs, and 562 who own a garden spade. In addition, each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things. Find the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.\"\n\nSo \"these things\" includes the candy hearts. Therefore, when they say someone owns exactly two of these things, it's two items including the candy hearts. But since everyone owns candy hearts, the only way someone could own exactly two items is if they own the candy hearts plus exactly one of the other three. Wait, but that would mean \"exactly two of these things\" would be candy hearts plus one other, so exactly two total. Similarly, \"exactly three of these things\" would be candy hearts plus two others, so three total. And \"all four\" would be candy hearts plus all three of the others. \n\nTherefore, the problem is structured with four items: candy hearts (everyone has), diamond rings (195), golf clubs (367), garden spades (562). \n\nThe counts given are:\n\n- Total residents: 900.\n\n- Number owning exactly two items (including candy hearts): 437.\n\n- Number owning exactly three items (including candy hearts): 234.\n\n- We need to find the number owning all four items (so candy hearts plus the other three).\n\nHmm, okay. So we need to use inclusion-exclusion here. Let me think about how to model this. Let me denote the sets as follows:\n\nLet C be the set of people who own candy hearts. Since everyone is in C, |C| = 900.\n\nLet D be the set of people who own a diamond ring: |D| = 195.\n\nG for golf clubs: |G| = 367.\n\nS for garden spades: |S| = 562.\n\nWe need to find |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|. But since everyone is in C, this is just |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nWait, actually, since all residents are in C, the intersections with C are redundant. So the problem reduces to finding |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|, since C is the universal set here.\n\nTherefore, perhaps it's better to consider the problem in terms of the three items D, G, S, with the universal set being all 900 people (since everyone has C). So the problem is really about the three sets D, G, S within the universal set of 900 people. However, the counts given involve exactly two and exactly three items, which include the candy hearts. Wait, but since everyone has candy hearts, the counts of exactly two items would be those who have C plus exactly one of D, G, S. Similarly, exactly three items would be C plus two of D, G, S, and exactly four items would be C plus all three of D, G, S. \n\nTherefore, the problem is structured so that:\n\n- The number of people with exactly two items (including C) is equal to the number of people who have C plus exactly one of D, G, S. Since C is everyone, this is the same as the number of people who are in exactly one of D, G, S. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, exactly two items: since everyone has C, the two items must be C and one other. So the count of exactly two items is the number of people in exactly one of D, G, S. Wait, but actually, the \"two items\" would be C plus one of D, G, S, so that's exactly two items. Similarly, exactly three items would be C plus two of the others, so that's three items total. Exactly four items would be C plus all three of D, G, S. \n\nTherefore, the problem can be rephrased as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s define the three sets D, G, S with universe 900. The problem states that the number of people in exactly one of D, G, S is 437 (since exactly two items total, which are C and one other). The number of people in exactly two of D, G, S is 234 (since exactly three items total: C plus two others). The number of people in all three D, G, S is what we need to find, since that would be the ones with all four items (including C).\n\nAdditionally, the total number of people is 900. Also, the total in D is 195, G is 367, S is 562. \n\nTherefore, perhaps we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle for three sets. Let me recall the formula:\n\nThe total number of people in at least one of D, G, S is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nBut we also know that the total number of people in exactly one set plus exactly two sets plus exactly three sets equals |D \u222a G \u222a S|. Since everyone is in C, but D, G, S might not cover everyone. Wait, but actually, the problem doesn't state that everyone has at least one of D, G, S. Wait, but the counts given are 437 (exactly two items, which would be exactly one of D, G, S) plus 234 (exactly three items, which would be exactly two of D, G, S) plus the number of people with all three (so exactly four items, which is exactly three of D, G, S) plus the people who have none of D, G, S (so only C). Therefore, the total is:\n\nNumber with exactly 1 of DGS (i.e., exactly two items total) = 437\n\nNumber with exactly 2 of DGS (exactly three items total) = 234\n\nNumber with exactly 3 of DGS (exactly four items total) = x (the answer we need)\n\nNumber with 0 of DGS (only C) = ?\n\nTotal must be 900. So:\n\n437 + 234 + x + (number with none of DGS) = 900\n\nBut we don't know the number with none of DGS yet. Alternatively, perhaps we can express the total in D \u222a G \u222a S as (437 + 234 + x). Therefore:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 437 + 234 + x = 671 + x\n\nTherefore, the number of people with none of D, G, S is 900 - (671 + x) = 229 - x.\n\nNow, using inclusion-exclusion for |D \u222a G \u222a S|:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nWe can write that as:\n\n671 + x = 195 + 367 + 562 - (|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|\n\nWait, let me compute the sum of |D| + |G| + |S| first: 195 + 367 + 562.\n\n195 + 367 = 562, and then +562 gives 1124. Wait, 195+367 is 562? Let me check:\n\n195 + 367: 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. Yes. Then 562 + 562 is 1124. So that's the sum.\n\nSo:\n\n671 + x = 1124 - (sum of pairwise intersections) + (triple intersection)\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet a = |D \u2229 G|,\n\nb = |D \u2229 S|,\n\nc = |G \u2229 S|,\n\nand d = |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| (which is the x we need to find, since that's the number with all three of DGS, i.e., all four items including C).\n\nWait, actually, yes, because |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| is exactly the number of people who have all four items (since they have D, G, S, and C). So d = x.\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n671 + x = 1124 - (a + b + c) + x\n\nWait, hold on, substituting d with x? Wait, the formula is:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - (a + b + c) + d\n\nTherefore, substituting:\n\n671 + x = 1124 - (a + b + c) + x\n\nWait, so if I subtract 1124 from both sides:\n\n671 + x - 1124 = - (a + b + c) + x\n\nThen, 671 - 1124 = - (a + b + c)\n\nSo, (671 - 1124) = - (a + b + c)\n\nTherefore, (a + b + c) = 1124 - 671 = 453\n\nHmm, so the sum of the pairwise intersections is 453. But how does this help?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need another equation. Let me think about how the numbers of people in exactly one, two, or three sets relate to the intersections.\n\nThe number of people in exactly one set is 437. That can be written as:\n\n(|D| - (a + b - d) - ... Wait, perhaps better to recall the standard breakdown:\n\nThe number of people in exactly one set is:\n\n|D| + |G| + |S| - 2*(a + b + c) + 3*d\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me recall:\n\nThe formula for exactly one set is:\n\n(|D| - (a + b - d)) + (|G| - (a + c - d)) + (|S| - (b + c - d)) ) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of inclusion-exclusion components.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula is:\n\nNumber of exactly one = |D| + |G| + |S| - 2*(a + b + c) + 3*d ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me think of it as:\n\nEach of the pairwise intersections a, b, c includes the triple intersection d. So, for example:\n\nThe number of people in exactly D and G but not S is a - d,\n\nSimilarly for the others.\n\nTherefore, the number of people in exactly two sets would be (a - d) + (b - d) + (c - d) = (a + b + c) - 3d.\n\nSimilarly, the number in exactly one set would be:\n\n(|D| - (a + b - d)) + (|G| - (a + c - d)) + (|S| - (b + c - d))\n\nWait, let me do it step by step.\n\nThe number in exactly D only is |D| - (number in D and G) - (number in D and S) + (number in all three). Wait, no:\n\nWait, the formula for exactly D is:\n\n|D| - (those in D and G) - (those in D and S) + (those in all three). Because when you subtract the pairwise intersections, you subtracted the triple intersection twice, so you have to add it back once.\n\nWait, actually, let me recall:\n\nThe number of elements only in D is |D| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|. Wait, no, actually, if you subtract the intersections, you have:\n\n|D| - (number in D and G) - (number in D and S) + (number in D and G and S). Because when you subtract D \u2229 G and D \u2229 S, you subtracted the triple intersection twice, so you add it back once.\n\nWait, actually, let me think of it as:\n\nThe count for exactly D is |D| minus those in D and another set. So:\n\nExactly D = |D| - (number in D \u2229 G + D \u2229 S - D \u2229 G \u2229 S). Because D \u2229 G includes those also in S, and D \u2229 S also includes those in all three, so when subtracting both, you subtract the triple intersection twice, so you need to add it back once.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe an easier way is:\n\nTotal in exactly one set = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2*(a + b + c) + 3*d\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nEach person in exactly one set is counted once in |D|, |G|, or |S|. \n\nEach person in exactly two sets is counted twice in the sum |D|+|G|+|S|, so to get the count for exactly one, we subtract 2*(sum of pairwise intersections). But the pairwise intersections include the triple overlaps. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, the standard formula for exactly one is:\n\nExactly one = (|D| + |G| + |S|) - 2*(|D \u2229 G| + |D \u2229 S| + |G \u2229 S|) + 3*(|D \u2229 G \u2229 S|)\n\nLet me check with a simple example. Suppose all three sets are the same, so |D|=|G|=|S|=n, and all intersections are n. Then exactly one would be 0, and the formula would give n + n + n - 2*(n + n + n) + 3n = 3n -6n +3n =0, which works.\n\nAnother example: suppose D, G, S are pairwise disjoint except for the triple intersection. Then |D \u2229 G|=|D \u2229 S|=|G \u2229 S|=d, and |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|=d. Then exactly one would be |D| + |G| + |S| - 2*(d + d + d) + 3*d = (|D|+|G|+|S|) - 6d +3d = (sum) -3d. But in reality, exactly one would be (|D| - 2d) + (|G| -2d) + (|S| -2d) )? Wait no. If all pairwise overlaps are exactly d (the triple), then the exactly one count is (|D| - d) + (|G| - d) + (|S| - d) ) = (sum) - 3d. Which matches the formula. So yes, the formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula for exactly one is:\n\nExactly one = |D| + |G| + |S| - 2(a + b + c) + 3d.\n\nSimilarly, exactly two is:\n\nEach exactly two count is (a - d) + (b - d) + (c - d) = (a + b + c) - 3d.\n\nAnd exactly three is d.\n\nGiven that, let's plug in the known values.\n\nWe have:\n\nExactly one = 437 = (195 + 367 + 562) - 2*(a + b + c) + 3d\n\nExactly two = 234 = (a + b + c) - 3d\n\nExactly three = d = x (the answer we need)\n\nWe already found from the inclusion-exclusion earlier that:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 671 + x = 1124 - (a + b + c) + d\n\nWait, but maybe we can use the equations from exactly one and exactly two first.\n\nLet me note that:\n\nEquation 1: 437 = (195 + 367 + 562) - 2*(a + b + c) + 3d\n\nCompute 195+367+562: 195+367 is 562, then +562 gives 1124. So:\n\n437 = 1124 - 2*(a + b + c) + 3d\n\nEquation 2: 234 = (a + b + c) - 3d\n\nSo let me denote S = a + b + c. Then Equation 2 gives S = 234 + 3d.\n\nPlugging S into Equation 1:\n\n437 = 1124 - 2*(234 + 3d) + 3d\n\nLet me compute that step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the terms:\n\n437 = 1124 - 2*234 - 2*(3d) + 3d\n\nCompute 2*234 = 468, and 2*(3d) is 6d:\n\n437 = 1124 - 468 -6d +3d\n\nSimplify constants: 1124 - 468 = 656\n\nSo:\n\n437 = 656 - 3d\n\nNow, subtract 656 from both sides:\n\n437 - 656 = -3d\n\nWhich is -219 = -3d \u2192 d = 73.\n\nWait, so d = 73? Let me check the arithmetic again.\n\nWait, 437 = 1124 - 2*(a + b + c) + 3d.\n\nBut since a + b + c = 234 + 3d,\n\nthen substituting:\n\n437 = 1124 - 2*(234 + 3d) + 3d\n\nCompute 2*(234 + 3d) = 468 + 6d,\n\nso,\n\n437 = 1124 - 468 -6d +3d,\n\nso,\n\n437 = (1124 - 468) + (-6d +3d),\n\n1124 -468: Let me compute 1124 - 400 = 724, then -68 more gives 656.\n\nThus 656 - 3d = 437,\n\nSo 656 -437 = 3d,\n\n656 - 437: 656 -400=256, then -37 more is 219.\n\nSo 219 = 3d \u2192 d = 73. Yes, that's correct.\n\nSo d = 73. Therefore, the number of people who own all four items is 73. Let me check if this makes sense with the other equations.\n\nLet me check Equation 2: 234 = (a + b + c) - 3d,\n\nsince d=73, then a + b + c =234 + 3*73 =234 +219=453.\n\nEarlier, when we did the inclusion-exclusion, we had:\n\nFrom |D \u222a G \u222a S|=671 +x (since x is d=73, so that would be 671 +73=744)\n\nWait, let me confirm that. Wait, the total in the union is exactly one (437) + exactly two (234) + exactly three (73) = 437 +234=671 +73=744.\n\nThen the inclusion-exclusion formula says:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S|= |D|+|G|+|S| - (a + b + c) + d = 1124 -453 +73.\n\nCompute that: 1124 -453 = 671, plus 73 gives 744. Which matches. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the calculations check out.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 73. Let me just make sure there are no other constraints or possible mistakes.\n\nWait, the problem states that each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts. So, the total number of people not in D, G, or S is 900 - |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 900 -744=156. That's okay, since they would only have candy hearts, which is allowed.\n\nIs there any other condition I might have missed? The problem didn't mention anything else, so I think this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the number of residents who own all four things is 73.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}\n\n\nGiven the problem of finding the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items (diamond ring, set of golf clubs, garden spade, and bag of candy hearts), we start by noting that every resident owns a bag of candy hearts. Therefore, we only need to consider the intersections of the sets of residents owning the other three items: diamond rings (D), golf clubs (G), and garden spades (S).\n\nWe are given:\n- Total residents: 900\n- Residents owning exactly two items (including candy hearts): 437 (which translates to exactly one of D, G, S)\n- Residents owning exactly three items (including candy hearts): 234 (which translates to exactly two of D, G, S)\n- We need to find the number of residents owning all three of D, G, S (which translates to all four items including candy hearts).\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion for sets D, G, and S, we denote:\n- \\( |D| = 195 \\)\n- \\( |G| = 367 \\)\n- \\( |S| = 562 \\)\n- \\( a = |D \\cap G| \\)\n- \\( b = |D \\cap S| \\)\n- \\( c = |G \\cap S| \\)\n- \\( d = |D \\cap G \\cap S| \\) (the value we need to find)\n\nThe number of residents in exactly one of the sets D, G, S is given by:\n\\[\n437 = |D| + |G| + |S| - 2(a + b + c) + 3d\n\\]\nThe number of residents in exactly two of the sets D, G, S is given by:\n\\[\n234 = (a + b + c) - 3d\n\\]\n\nWe solve these equations step-by-step. First, we express \\( a + b + c \\) from the second equation:\n\\[\na + b + c = 234 + 3d\n\\]\n\nSubstituting this into the first equation:\n\\[\n437 = 195 + 367 + 562 - 2(234 + 3d) + 3d\n\\]\nSimplifying the constants and terms:\n\\[\n437 = 1124 - 2(234 + 3d) + 3d\n\\]\n\\[\n437 = 1124 - 468 - 6d + 3d\n\\]\n\\[\n437 = 656 - 3d\n\\]\nSolving for \\( d \\):\n\\[\n3d = 656 - 437\n\\]\n\\[\n3d = 219\n\\]\n\\[\nd = 73\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts) is \\(\\boxed{73}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we have 900 residents in Aimeville. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Then there are some who own other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The question is asking how many own all four items. Wait, but since everyone already owns the candy hearts, the fourth item would be one of the other three? Or maybe the four items include the candy hearts? Let me read again.\n\nAh, right: the problem says \"the number of residents who own all four of these things.\" The four things must be the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Since every resident has the candy hearts, the ones who own all four would be those who have the three other items plus the candy hearts. But since everyone has the candy hearts, that's equivalent to the number of people who have all three of the other items (diamond, golf, spade) plus the candy hearts. But actually, since the candy hearts are owned by everyone, the overlap of all four is just the same as the number of people who own all three of the other items. Wait, maybe not exactly, but let's think through with the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe problem gives us the total number of residents, 900. Each owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given. The other items: 195 own diamond rings, 367 golf clubs, 562 garden spades. Then, it says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three of these things. Wait, but does \"these things\" refer to all four items, or the three items excluding candy hearts? Hmm, the wording says \"exactly two of these things\" and \"exactly three of these things\". The problem mentions four items in total: diamond, golf, spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone has the candy hearts, maybe \"these things\" refers to the four items, but in that case, the count of people owning exactly two would have to exclude the candy hearts? Wait, that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"these things\" refers to the three items (diamond, golf, spade), since the candy hearts are owned by everyone. Let me check the problem again: \"There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" The \"these things\" might refer to all four items, but since everyone has the candy hearts, owning exactly two would mean two of the other three plus the candy hearts. Wait, this is a bit ambiguous. Hmm, perhaps the problem is structured such that the four items are considered, and the counts of exactly two and exactly three are over all four items. But since everyone has the candy hearts, the \"exactly two\" would have to include the candy hearts as one of the two? Or not? Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the four items, so \"exactly two\" would mean exactly two of the four items. But since everyone has the candy hearts, that would mean that the \"exactly two\" must include the candy hearts. Wait, but if someone owns exactly two items, one of them has to be the candy hearts, and the other is one of the other three. But then \"exactly two of these things\" would mean two items, one of which is the candy hearts and another is either diamond, golf, or spade. Similarly, \"exactly three\" would mean three items, one of which is candy hearts and two others. Then, \"all four\" would be those who have all four, which would include the candy hearts plus the other three. But the problem says \"the number of residents who own all four of these things,\" so that's the value we need.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the three items (diamond, golf, spade), and the candy hearts are separate, but since everyone has them, perhaps they are not counted in the \"exactly two\" or \"exactly three.\" Wait, but the problem states \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts,\" so the candy hearts are owned by everyone. The counts for exactly two and exactly three probably refer to the other three items (diamond, golf, spade), since otherwise, if you include the candy hearts, the counts would be different.\n\nLet me think again. Let me parse the problem:\n\nTotal residents: 900.\n\nOwnership:\n\n- Diamond rings: 195\n\n- Golf clubs: 367\n\n- Garden spades: 562\n\n- Candy hearts: 900 (everyone)\n\nAdditionally, the number of people who own exactly two of \"these things\" is 437, and exactly three is 234. The question is the number who own all four.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts,\" so candy hearts are universal. So when it refers to \"these things,\" it might include all four items. So \"exactly two of these things\" would mean exactly two items, one of which could be the candy hearts or not? But since everyone has candy hearts, you can't have someone who owns only candy hearts and nothing else, because that would be exactly one item. Wait, but if \"exactly two\" includes the candy hearts, then that's okay. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose the four items are: D (diamond), G (golf), S (spade), C (candy). Since everyone has C, so C is included in everyone's set. So when someone owns exactly two items, they must have C plus one other (D, G, or S). Similarly, exactly three items would be C plus two others, and exactly four items would be all four. The problem says there are 437 with exactly two, and 234 with exactly three. The question is how many have all four (i.e., C plus D, G, S).\n\nSo to model this, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion, but considering that C is universal, so we can think in terms of the other three items. Let me consider the three items D, G, S, and note that everyone has C. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet A be the set of people who own D.\n\nB be the set who own G.\n\nC be the set who own S.\n\nBut actually, since C is already used for candy hearts, maybe use D, G, S for the three items. Let me redefine:\n\nLet D = diamond ring owners (195)\n\nG = golf clubs (367)\n\nS = garden spades (562)\n\nC = candy hearts (900, everyone)\n\nWe need to find |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|. But since everyone is in C, this is just |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nBut the problem says \"the number of residents who own all four of these things,\" which would indeed be |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|, since C is everyone.\n\nSo to compute that, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion on D, G, S, considering the counts given.\n\nWait, but the problem gives us the number of people with exactly two items and exactly three items. Let me think of the standard inclusion-exclusion formula.\n\nAlternatively, since all residents have C, so we can model the problem in terms of the three items D, G, S, with the total population being 900. The counts of people owning each of D, G, S are given (195, 367, 562). The number of people owning exactly two of these three items (since C is already given) is 437. Wait, but the problem says \"exactly two of these things\"\u2014but if \"these things\" includes C, then that complicates things. But since everyone has C, perhaps \"exactly two\" refers to exactly two of D, G, S. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" The \"these things\" probably refers to all four items (since it's mentioned after listing all four). But since everyone has the candy hearts, the counts of exactly two would have to include the candy hearts as one of the two. For instance, someone who owns exactly two things must have candy hearts plus one of the other three. Similarly, exactly three would be candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four would be all four. \n\nTherefore, the total number of residents can be partitioned into those who have exactly 1 item (only candy hearts?), exactly 2 items (candy + one other), exactly 3 items (candy + two others), and exactly 4 items (all four). However, since everyone has at least the candy hearts, the minimal number of items owned is 1 (only candy). But the problem mentions exactly two and exactly three, so let me structure the total as:\n\nTotal = (only C) + (C + one other) + (C + two others) + (all four).\n\nGiven that, the problem states:\n\nTotal residents = 900.\n\nNumber with exactly two things: 437. This would correspond to (C + one other).\n\nNumber with exactly three things: 234. That would be (C + two others).\n\nWe need to find the number with all four, which is (C + D + G + S), which is the same as D \u2229 G \u2229 S (since C is everyone).\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet x be the number of people who own all four items (i.e., D, G, S, and C). Since everyone has C, this is |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of people who own exactly two items (C plus one other) as 437. The number with exactly three (C plus two others) is 234, and the number with all four is x. The rest must be those who own only C (so exactly one item). Let me compute the number of people who own only C: Let\u2019s call that y. So total is:\n\ny + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nThus, y = 900 - 437 -234 -x = 900 - 671 -x = 229 -x.\n\nNow, we need another equations to solve for x. Let's consider the counts of each individual item.\n\nFirst, the number of people who own D is 195. This includes those who have D along with C and possibly others. Specifically, the people who own D are:\n\n- Those who have only D and C (part of the \"exactly two\" group),\n\n- Those who have D and another item (like G or S) plus C (so in the \"exactly three\" group),\n\n- Those who have all four (D, G, S, C).\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor diamond rings (D):\n\nNumber of people owning D = (number with D and exactly two items) + (number with D and exactly three items) + (number with all four).\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables for the different overlaps:\n\nLet a = number of people who own exactly D and C (so only D and C, part of the exactly two group).\n\nb = exactly G and C.\n\nc = exactly S and C.\n\nThen, the exactly two group (437) is a + b + c.\n\nNow, for the exactly three group (234):\n\nThese are people who own two of D, G, S plus C. Let me denote:\n\nd = number owning D, G, and C (but not S),\n\ne = number owning D, S, and C (but not G),\n\nf = number owning G, S, and C (but not D),\n\ng = number owning all four (D, G, S, C). Wait, but actually, if someone owns all four, they are in the \"exactly four\" group, so the exactly three group should exclude those who have all four. Wait, no, the exactly three group would be those who have three items (including C) but not the fourth. So for example, D, G, C but not S; or D, S, C but not G; etc. The total exactly three would be d + e + f, where d, e, f are as above. The all four group is g = x.\n\nTherefore, the total exactly three is d + e + f = 234.\n\nNow, the counts for each item (D, G, S):\n\nFor D:\n\nNumber owning D = a (D and C only) + d (D, G, C) + e (D, S, C) + x (all four).\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\nNumber owning G = b (G and C only) + d (D, G, C) + f (G, S, C) + x.\n\nFor S:\n\nNumber owning S = c (S and C only) + e (D, S, C) + f (G, S, C) + x.\n\nSo we have three equations:\n\n1) a + d + e + x = 195 (for D)\n\n2) b + d + f + x = 367 (for G)\n\n3) c + e + f + x = 562 (for S)\n\nWe also know that:\n\na + b + c = 437 (exactly two)\n\nd + e + f = 234 (exactly three)\n\nAnd the total:\n\ny + 437 + 234 + x = 900, where y = 229 - x (from earlier).\n\nBut we might not need y directly. Let's see.\n\nWe have variables a, b, c, d, e, f, x. Let me see if we can express everything in terms of x and the other variables.\n\nLet me try to combine equations. Let's sum equations 1, 2, 3:\n\n(a + d + e + x) + (b + d + f + x) + (c + e + f + x) = 195 + 367 + 562\n\nLeft side:\n\n(a + b + c) + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x\n\nWe know that a + b + c = 437,\n\nand d + e + f = 234,\n\nso substituting:\n\n437 + 2*(d + e + f) + 3x = 437 + 2*234 + 3x = 437 + 468 + 3x = 905 + 3x\n\nThe right side is 195 + 367 + 562 = let's compute that:\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, no, wait: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124? Wait, 195 + 367 is 562? Wait, 195 + 367: 195+300=495, +67=562. Yes, so 562 + 562 is 1124? Wait, no, 562 (from D + G) plus 562 (S) would be 1124? Wait 195+367+562:\n\n195+367 = 562, then 562 + 562 = 1124. Correct.\n\nSo left side is 905 + 3x = 1124.\n\nThus:\n\n3x = 1124 - 905 = 219 \u2192 x = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, so x would be 73? Let me check the steps again to make sure.\n\nFirst, sum of the three equations:\n\n(a + d + e + x) + (b + d + f + x) + (c + e + f + x) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nLeft side:\n\na + b + c + (d + d) + (e + e) + (f + f) + x + x + x + (the remaining terms?)\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nEach term:\n\nFirst equation: a + d + e + x,\n\nSecond: b + d + f + x,\n\nThird: c + e + f + x.\n\nAdding them:\n\na + b + c + (d + d) + (e + e) + (f + f) + (x + x + x) + ...?\n\nWait, yes:\n\nThe variables:\n\na, b, c are each once.\n\nd appears twice (from first and second equations),\n\ne appears twice (from first and third),\n\nf appears twice (from second and third),\n\nand x appears three times (once in each equation).\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed (a + b + c) + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x.\n\nThen substituting:\n\na + b + c = 437,\n\nd + e + f = 234,\n\nso 2*(d + e + f) = 2*234 = 468,\n\nso total left side: 437 + 468 + 3x = 905 + 3x.\n\nSet equal to 1124,\n\nSo 3x = 1124 - 905 = 219,\n\nThus x = 73. \n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another approach. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the three items D, G, S (since C is universal):\n\nThe total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the sum of each set minus the sum of pairwise intersections plus the triple intersection.\n\nBut since everyone has C, but the problem counts people based on their ownership of the four items, but since C is universal, maybe we can model the non-C items as D, G, S, and compute how many have at least one of those, then relate to the given numbers.\n\nWait, actually, let's think again. Since all residents have C, the total number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is equal to total residents minus those who own only C. The number who own only C is y = 229 - x (from earlier).\n\nWait, total residents = 900 = y + (those who have at least one of D, G, S). Therefore,\n\nNumber with at least one of D, G, S = 900 - y = 900 - (229 - x) = 671 + x.\n\nOn the other hand, using inclusion-exclusion for D, G, S:\n\nNumber with at least one of D, G, S = |D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nWe know |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562.\n\nWe need expressions for the intersections.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet |D \u2229 G| = a + x + d, where:\n\nWait, perhaps better to express the intersections in terms of the variables we had before.\n\nWait, let's see. The intersections:\n\nThe pairwise intersections like D \u2229 G include those who have D and G and possibly others. Specifically:\n\nD \u2229 G includes:\n\n- Those who have D, G, and C but not S (which is d),\n\n- Those who have D, G, S, and C (x),\n\n- Those who have D, G, and C but not S (d),\n\nWait, actually, perhaps:\n\nWait, let me think again. The people in D \u2229 G are those who have both D and G. This includes:\n\n- Those who have exactly D, G, and C (d),\n\n- Those who have D, G, S, and C (x),\n\n- Those who have D, G, and possibly other items (but since the only other item is S, so either they have only D, G, C or all four).\n\nThus, |D \u2229 G| = d + x.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|D \u2229 S| = e + x,\n\n|G \u2229 S| = f + x,\n\nAnd |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = x.\n\nTherefore, substituting into inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - (d + x + e + x + f + x) + x\n\n= (195 + 367 + 562) - (d + e + f + 3x) + x\n\n= 1124 - ( (d + e + f) + 3x ) + x\n\n= 1124 - (234 + 3x) + x [since d + e + f =234]\n\n= 1124 -234 -2x\n\n= 890 - 2x\n\nBut we also had that |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 671 + x.\n\nSo:\n\n890 - 2x = 671 + x\n\n\u2192 890 -671 = 3x \u2192 219 = 3x \u2192 x=73. Same result as before.\n\nTherefore, that seems consistent. So the answer is 73. Let me confirm once more with another angle.\n\nAlternatively, since we found x=73, let's check if the numbers add up. Let me see:\n\nWe had the equation from the sum of D, G, S counts leading to x=73. And the inclusion-exclusion also gives the same. So that seems solid.\n\nAnother check: Let's compute y =229 -x =229-73=156. So the number of people who own only candy hearts is 156. Then total is 156 +437 +234 +73 = 156+437=593, 593+234=827, 827+73=900. That adds up.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 73. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we have 900 residents in Aimeville. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. Then there are some who own other items: diamond rings, golf clubs, and garden spades. The question is asking how many own all four items. Wait, but since everyone already owns the candy hearts, the fourth item would be one of the other three? Or maybe the four items include the candy hearts? Let me read again.\n\nAh, right: the problem says \"the number of residents who own all four of these things.\" The four things must be the diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Since every resident has the candy hearts, the ones who own all four would be those who have the three other items plus the candy hearts. But since everyone has the candy hearts, that's equivalent to the number of people who have all three of the other items (diamond, golf, spade) plus the candy hearts. But actually, since the candy hearts are owned by everyone, the overlap of all four is just the same as the number of people who own all three of the other items. Wait, maybe not exactly, but let's think through with the principle of inclusion-exclusion.\n\nThe problem gives us the total number of residents, 900. Each owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's a given. The other items: 195 own diamond rings, 367 golf clubs, 562 garden spades. Then, it says there are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 who own exactly three of these things. Wait, but does \"these things\" refer to all four items, or the three items excluding candy hearts? Hmm, the wording says \"exactly two of these things\" and \"exactly three of these things\". The problem mentions four items in total: diamond, golf, spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone has the candy hearts, maybe \"these things\" refers to the four items, but in that case, the count of people owning exactly two would have to exclude the candy hearts? Wait, that might complicate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps \"these things\" refers to the three items (diamond, golf, spade), since the candy hearts are owned by everyone. Let me check the problem again: \"There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" The \"these things\" might refer to all four items, but since everyone has the candy hearts, owning exactly two would mean two of the other three plus the candy hearts. Wait, this is a bit ambiguous. Hmm, perhaps the problem is structured such that the four items are considered, and the counts of exactly two and exactly three are over all four items. But since everyone has the candy hearts, the \"exactly two\" would have to include the candy hearts as one of the two? Or not? Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is considering the four items, so \"exactly two\" would mean exactly two of the four items. But since everyone has the candy hearts, that would mean that the \"exactly two\" must include the candy hearts. Wait, but if someone owns exactly two items, one of them has to be the candy hearts, and the other is one of the other three. But then \"exactly two of these things\" would mean two items, one of which is the candy hearts and another is either diamond, golf, or spade. Similarly, \"exactly three\" would mean three items, one of which is candy hearts and two others. Then, \"all four\" would be those who have all four, which would include the candy hearts plus the other three. But the problem says \"the number of residents who own all four of these things,\" so that's the value we need.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is considering the three items (diamond, golf, spade), and the candy hearts are separate, but since everyone has them, perhaps they are not counted in the \"exactly two\" or \"exactly three.\" Wait, but the problem states \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts,\" so the candy hearts are owned by everyone. The counts for exactly two and exactly three probably refer to the other three items (diamond, golf, spade), since otherwise, if you include the candy hearts, the counts would be different.\n\nLet me think again. Let me parse the problem:\n\nTotal residents: 900.\n\nOwnership:\n\n- Diamond rings: 195\n\n- Golf clubs: 367\n\n- Garden spades: 562\n\n- Candy hearts: 900 (everyone)\n\nAdditionally, the number of people who own exactly two of \"these things\" is 437, and exactly three is 234. The question is the number who own all four.\n\nWait, the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts,\" so candy hearts are universal. So when it refers to \"these things,\" it might include all four items. So \"exactly two of these things\" would mean exactly two items, one of which could be the candy hearts or not? But since everyone has candy hearts, you can't have someone who owns only candy hearts and nothing else, because that would be exactly one item. Wait, but if \"exactly two\" includes the candy hearts, then that's okay. Let me clarify:\n\nSuppose the four items are: D (diamond), G (golf), S (spade), C (candy). Since everyone has C, so C is included in everyone's set. So when someone owns exactly two items, they must have C plus one other (D, G, or S). Similarly, exactly three items would be C plus two others, and exactly four items would be all four. The problem says there are 437 with exactly two, and 234 with exactly three. The question is how many have all four (i.e., C plus D, G, S).\n\nSo to model this, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion, but considering that C is universal, so we can think in terms of the other three items. Let me consider the three items D, G, S, and note that everyone has C. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet A be the set of people who own D.\n\nB be the set who own G.\n\nC be the set who own S.\n\nBut actually, since C is already used for candy hearts, maybe use D, G, S for the three items. Let me redefine:\n\nLet D = diamond ring owners (195)\n\nG = golf clubs (367)\n\nS = garden spades (562)\n\nC = candy hearts (900, everyone)\n\nWe need to find |D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C|. But since everyone is in C, this is just |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nBut the problem says \"the number of residents who own all four of these things,\" which would indeed be |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|, since C is everyone.\n\nSo to compute that, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion on D, G, S, considering the counts given.\n\nWait, but the problem gives us the number of people with exactly two items and exactly three items. Let me think of the standard inclusion-exclusion formula.\n\nAlternatively, since all residents have C, so we can model the problem in terms of the three items D, G, S, with the total population being 900. The counts of people owning each of D, G, S are given (195, 367, 562). The number of people owning exactly two of these three items (since C is already given) is 437. Wait, but the problem says \"exactly two of these things\"\u2014but if \"these things\" includes C, then that complicates things. But since everyone has C, perhaps \"exactly two\" refers to exactly two of D, G, S. Let me proceed with that assumption.\n\nWait, let me check the problem statement again: \"There are 437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\" The \"these things\" probably refers to all four items (since it's mentioned after listing all four). But since everyone has the candy hearts, the counts of exactly two would have to include the candy hearts as one of the two. For instance, someone who owns exactly two things must have candy hearts plus one of the other three. Similarly, exactly three would be candy hearts plus two others, and exactly four would be all four. \n\nTherefore, the total number of residents can be partitioned into those who have exactly 1 item (only candy hearts?), exactly 2 items (candy + one other), exactly 3 items (candy + two others), and exactly 4 items (all four). However, since everyone has at least the candy hearts, the minimal number of items owned is 1 (only candy). But the problem mentions exactly two and exactly three, so let me structure the total as:\n\nTotal = (only C) + (C + one other) + (C + two others) + (all four).\n\nGiven that, the problem states:\n\nTotal residents = 900.\n\nNumber with exactly two things: 437. This would correspond to (C + one other).\n\nNumber with exactly three things: 234. That would be (C + two others).\n\nWe need to find the number with all four, which is (C + D + G + S), which is the same as D \u2229 G \u2229 S (since C is everyone).\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet x be the number of people who own all four items (i.e., D, G, S, and C). Since everyone has C, this is |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of people who own exactly two items (C plus one other) as 437. The number with exactly three (C plus two others) is 234, and the number with all four is x. The rest must be those who own only C (so exactly one item). Let me compute the number of people who own only C: Let\u2019s call that y. So total is:\n\ny + 437 + 234 + x = 900.\n\nThus, y = 900 - 437 -234 -x = 900 - 671 -x = 229 -x.\n\nNow, we need another equations to solve for x. Let's consider the counts of each individual item.\n\nFirst, the number of people who own D is 195. This includes those who have D along with C and possibly others. Specifically, the people who own D are:\n\n- Those who have only D and C (part of the \"exactly two\" group),\n\n- Those who have D and another item (like G or S) plus C (so in the \"exactly three\" group),\n\n- Those who have all four (D, G, S, C).\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nFor diamond rings (D):\n\nNumber of people owning D = (number with D and exactly two items) + (number with D and exactly three items) + (number with all four).\n\nSimilarly for G and S.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables for the different overlaps:\n\nLet a = number of people who own exactly D and C (so only D and C, part of the exactly two group).\n\nb = exactly G and C.\n\nc = exactly S and C.\n\nThen, the exactly two group (437) is a + b + c.\n\nNow, for the exactly three group (234):\n\nThese are people who own two of D, G, S plus C. Let me denote:\n\nd = number owning D, G, and C (but not S),\n\ne = number owning D, S, and C (but not G),\n\nf = number owning G, S, and C (but not D),\n\ng = number owning all four (D, G, S, C). Wait, but actually, if someone owns all four, they are in the \"exactly four\" group, so the exactly three group should exclude those who have all four. Wait, no, the exactly three group would be those who have three items (including C) but not the fourth. So for example, D, G, C but not S; or D, S, C but not G; etc. The total exactly three would be d + e + f, where d, e, f are as above. The all four group is g = x.\n\nTherefore, the total exactly three is d + e + f = 234.\n\nNow, the counts for each item (D, G, S):\n\nFor D:\n\nNumber owning D = a (D and C only) + d (D, G, C) + e (D, S, C) + x (all four).\n\nSimilarly, for G:\n\nNumber owning G = b (G and C only) + d (D, G, C) + f (G, S, C) + x.\n\nFor S:\n\nNumber owning S = c (S and C only) + e (D, S, C) + f (G, S, C) + x.\n\nSo we have three equations:\n\n1) a + d + e + x = 195 (for D)\n\n2) b + d + f + x = 367 (for G)\n\n3) c + e + f + x = 562 (for S)\n\nWe also know that:\n\na + b + c = 437 (exactly two)\n\nd + e + f = 234 (exactly three)\n\nAnd the total:\n\ny + 437 + 234 + x = 900, where y = 229 - x (from earlier).\n\nBut we might not need y directly. Let's see.\n\nWe have variables a, b, c, d, e, f, x. Let me see if we can express everything in terms of x and the other variables.\n\nLet me try to combine equations. Let's sum equations 1, 2, 3:\n\n(a + d + e + x) + (b + d + f + x) + (c + e + f + x) = 195 + 367 + 562\n\nLeft side:\n\n(a + b + c) + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x\n\nWe know that a + b + c = 437,\n\nand d + e + f = 234,\n\nso substituting:\n\n437 + 2*(d + e + f) + 3x = 437 + 2*234 + 3x = 437 + 468 + 3x = 905 + 3x\n\nThe right side is 195 + 367 + 562 = let's compute that:\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, no, wait: 195 + 367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124? Wait, 195 + 367 is 562? Wait, 195 + 367: 195+300=495, +67=562. Yes, so 562 + 562 is 1124? Wait, no, 562 (from D + G) plus 562 (S) would be 1124? Wait 195+367+562:\n\n195+367 = 562, then 562 + 562 = 1124. Correct.\n\nSo left side is 905 + 3x = 1124.\n\nThus:\n\n3x = 1124 - 905 = 219 \u2192 x = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, so x would be 73? Let me check the steps again to make sure.\n\nFirst, sum of the three equations:\n\n(a + d + e + x) + (b + d + f + x) + (c + e + f + x) = 195 + 367 + 562 = 1124.\n\nLeft side:\n\na + b + c + (d + d) + (e + e) + (f + f) + x + x + x + (the remaining terms?)\n\nWait, let me recount:\n\nEach term:\n\nFirst equation: a + d + e + x,\n\nSecond: b + d + f + x,\n\nThird: c + e + f + x.\n\nAdding them:\n\na + b + c + (d + d) + (e + e) + (f + f) + (x + x + x) + ...?\n\nWait, yes:\n\nThe variables:\n\na, b, c are each once.\n\nd appears twice (from first and second equations),\n\ne appears twice (from first and third),\n\nf appears twice (from second and third),\n\nand x appears three times (once in each equation).\n\nTherefore, the total is indeed (a + b + c) + 2d + 2e + 2f + 3x.\n\nThen substituting:\n\na + b + c = 437,\n\nd + e + f = 234,\n\nso 2*(d + e + f) = 2*234 = 468,\n\nso total left side: 437 + 468 + 3x = 905 + 3x.\n\nSet equal to 1124,\n\nSo 3x = 1124 - 905 = 219,\n\nThus x = 73. \n\nHmm, that seems straightforward. Let me check if this makes sense.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another approach. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, using the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the three items D, G, S (since C is universal):\n\nThe total number of people owning at least one of D, G, S is equal to the sum of each set minus the sum of pairwise intersections plus the triple intersection.\n\nBut since everyone has C, but the problem counts people based on their ownership of the four items, but since C is universal, maybe we can model the non-C items as D, G, S, and compute how many have at least one of those, then relate to the given numbers.\n\nWait, actually, let's think again. Since all residents have C, the total number of people who own at least one of D, G, S is equal to total residents minus those who own only C. The number who own only C is y = 229 - x (from earlier).\n\nWait, total residents = 900 = y + (those who have at least one of D, G, S). Therefore,\n\nNumber with at least one of D, G, S = 900 - y = 900 - (229 - x) = 671 + x.\n\nOn the other hand, using inclusion-exclusion for D, G, S:\n\nNumber with at least one of D, G, S = |D \u222a G \u222a S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \u2229 G| - |D \u2229 S| - |G \u2229 S| + |D \u2229 G \u2229 S|.\n\nWe know |D|=195, |G|=367, |S|=562.\n\nWe need expressions for the intersections.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet |D \u2229 G| = a + x + d, where:\n\nWait, perhaps better to express the intersections in terms of the variables we had before.\n\nWait, let's see. The intersections:\n\nThe pairwise intersections like D \u2229 G include those who have D and G and possibly others. Specifically:\n\nD \u2229 G includes:\n\n- Those who have D, G, and C but not S (which is d),\n\n- Those who have D, G, S, and C (x),\n\n- Those who have D, G, and C but not S (d),\n\nWait, actually, perhaps:\n\nWait, let me think again. The people in D \u2229 G are those who have both D and G. This includes:\n\n- Those who have exactly D, G, and C (d),\n\n- Those who have D, G, S, and C (x),\n\n- Those who have D, G, and possibly other items (but since the only other item is S, so either they have only D, G, C or all four).\n\nThus, |D \u2229 G| = d + x.\n\nSimilarly,\n\n|D \u2229 S| = e + x,\n\n|G \u2229 S| = f + x,\n\nAnd |D \u2229 G \u2229 S| = x.\n\nTherefore, substituting into inclusion-exclusion:\n\n|D \u222a G \u222a S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - (d + x + e + x + f + x) + x\n\n= (195 + 367 + 562) - (d + e + f + 3x) + x\n\n= 1124 - ( (d + e + f) + 3x ) + x\n\n= 1124 - (234 + 3x) + x [since d + e + f =234]\n\n= 1124 -234 -2x\n\n= 890 - 2x\n\nBut we also had that |D \u222a G \u222a S| = 671 + x.\n\nSo:\n\n890 - 2x = 671 + x\n\n\u2192 890 -671 = 3x \u2192 219 = 3x \u2192 x=73. Same result as before.\n\nTherefore, that seems consistent. So the answer is 73. Let me confirm once more with another angle.\n\nAlternatively, since we found x=73, let's check if the numbers add up. Let me see:\n\nWe had the equation from the sum of D, G, S counts leading to x=73. And the inclusion-exclusion also gives the same. So that seems solid.\n\nAnother check: Let's compute y =229 -x =229-73=156. So the number of people who own only candy hearts is 156. Then total is 156 +437 +234 +73 = 156+437=593, 593+234=827, 827+73=900. That adds up.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 73. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a diamond ring, a set of golf clubs, a garden spade, and a bag of candy hearts. Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts, we can focus on the intersections of the other three items (diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade).\n\nGiven:\n- Total residents: 900\n- Residents owning a diamond ring (D): 195\n- Residents owning golf clubs (G): 367\n- Residents owning garden spades (S): 562\n- Residents owning exactly two of the items (including candy hearts): 437\n- Residents owning exactly three of the items (including candy hearts): 234\n\nWe denote:\n- \\( x \\) as the number of residents who own all four items (i.e., \\( |D \\cap G \\cap S| \\))\n- The number of residents owning exactly two items (C plus one other) is 437, and exactly three items (C plus two others) is 234.\n\nUsing the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the three items D, G, and S, we calculate the total number of residents owning at least one of these items. The total number of residents owning at least one of D, G, or S is given by:\n\n\\[\n|D \\cup G \\cup S| = |D| + |G| + |S| - |D \\cap G| - |D \\cap S| - |G \\cap S| + |D \\cap G \\cap S|\n\\]\n\nWe know:\n- \\( |D| = 195 \\)\n- \\( |G| = 367 \\)\n- \\( |S| = 562 \\)\n- \\( |D \\cap G| = d + x \\)\n- \\( |D \\cap S| = e + x \\)\n- \\( |G \\cap S| = f + x \\)\n- \\( |D \\cap G \\cap S| = x \\)\n\nSubstituting the values and simplifying:\n\n\\[\n|D \\cup G \\cup S| = 195 + 367 + 562 - (d + e + f + 3x) + x\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( d + e + f = 234 \\):\n\n\\[\n|D \\cup G \\cup S| = 1124 - (234 + 3x) + x = 890 - 2x\n\\]\n\nThe total number of residents owning at least one of D, G, or S is also:\n\n\\[\n900 - y = 900 - (229 - x) = 671 + x\n\\]\n\nEquating the two expressions for \\( |D \\cup G \\cup S| \\):\n\n\\[\n890 - 2x = 671 + x\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\n3x = 219 \\implies x = 73\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of residents who own all four items is \\(\\boxed{73}\\).",
