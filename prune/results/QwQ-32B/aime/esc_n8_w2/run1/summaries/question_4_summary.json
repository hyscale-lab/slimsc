      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many numbers n \u2264 2024 are such that Bob can always win no matter what Alice does. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that these types of problems are usually approached using dynamic programming or by finding a pattern in the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the current player cannot force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a winning position means the current player can force a win with the right moves.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the base cases. Let's consider small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nIf n = 1: Alice takes the last token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nn = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob is forced to take the last one and win. Wait, no\u2014if Alice takes 1, leaving 1, then Bob takes the last one and wins. But that would mean Alice can't win? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, if Alice takes 1 from 2, leaving 1, then Bob takes the last one and wins. So actually, Alice can't force a win here. Wait, so n=2 would be a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win? Wait, no, the player to move is Alice at n=2. So if Alice is at n=2, she can choose to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, which would let Bob win. Alternatively, she could take 4, but that's not possible since there are only 2. So her only move is to take 1, which allows Bob to win. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for the player who has to move (Alice), so Bob can win if Alice is in n=2. Wait, but actually, the question is about positions where Bob can force a win regardless of Alice's play. So maybe I need to rephrase: For each n, we can label it as a winning or losing position. A winning position means the current player can force a win. A losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nTherefore, n=1 is a winning position (current player takes 1 and wins).\n\nn=2: current player can only take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for the current player.\n\nn=3: Current player can take 1, leaving 2 (a losing position for the opponent). Since leaving the opponent in a losing position means current player can win. So n=3 is a winning position.\n\nWait, let me check again. If current player is at n=3, they can take 1, leaving 2. Since n=2 is a losing position for the next player, so yes, that's a winning move. Therefore n=3 is a winning position.\n\nn=4: Current player can take all 4 and win. So n=4 is a winning position.\n\nn=5: Let's see. The current player can take 1, leaving 4 (which is a winning position for the opponent, since they can take all 4 and win). Alternatively, take 4, leaving 1 (which is a winning position for the opponent as they can take the last one). Therefore, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. Therefore n=5 is a losing position.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me confirm that. If n=5, current player's options are:\n\nTake 1: leaves 4. Then opponent can take all 4 and win. So that's bad.\n\nTake 4: leaves 1. Then opponent takes 1 and wins. Also bad. Therefore, no good moves. So n=5 is a losing position for the current player.\n\nn=6: Current player can take 1, leaving 5 (a losing position for opponent). Since n=5 is losing, that's a good move. So n=6 is a winning position.\n\nn=7: Current player can take 1, leaving 6 (which is winning for opponent). Or take 4, leaving 3 (which is a winning position for opponent as well). Wait, so both options lead to opponent winning? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait n=6 is a winning position, so if you leave 6, opponent can win. Similarly, n=3 is also a winning position. Therefore, if current player takes either 1 or 4 from 7, opponent can win. Therefore, n=7 is a losing position?\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Wait, let's check again:\n\nWait n=7:\n\nTake 1 token, leaving 6 (which is a winning position for opponent, so opponent can win). Take 4 tokens, leaving 3 (also a winning position for opponent). So no matter what, opponent can win. Therefore n=7 is a losing position.\n\nHmm, interesting. So n=5 and n=7 are losing positions so far. Let me continue.\n\nn=8:\n\nCurrent player can take 1, leaving 7 (which is a losing position for opponent). So that's a good move. Therefore, n=8 is a winning position.\n\nn=9:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 8 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 5 (losing for opponent). Wait, if you take 4 from 9, leaving 5, which is a losing position for opponent. So that's a winning move. Therefore n=9 is a winning position (since you can choose to take 4 and leave opponent at 5, which is losing).\n\nWait, so n=9: taking 4 is better. So yes, n=9 is a winning position.\n\nn=10:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 9 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 6 (winning for opponent). Hmm, so both options lead to opponent's win? Wait, but let me check n=6 is a winning position. So if you leave opponent at 9 or 6, which are both winning, so the current player can't force a win. Therefore, n=10 is a losing position?\n\nWait, n=10: options:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 9 (opponent can win by taking 4 to leave 5, which is losing). So opponent can win. Alternatively, take 4 \u2192 6 (opponent can take 1 to leave 5, which is losing). So opponent can also win here. Therefore, n=10 is a losing position.\n\nHmm, so n=5,7,10 are losing positions. Let me see n=11:\n\nn=11: Take 1 \u2192 10 (losing for opponent). So that's a winning move. Therefore n=11 is a winning position.\n\nn=12: Take 1 \u2192 11 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 8 (winning for opponent). Hmm, so both options leave opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=12 is a losing position?\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nWait n=11 is a winning position, so if you take 1 to leave 11, opponent can win. Taking 4 leaves 8, which is a winning position (since from 8 you can take 1 to leave 7, a losing position). Therefore, opponent can win from 8. Therefore, n=12 is a losing position.\n\nContinuing, n=13:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 12 (losing for opponent). So that's a winning move. Therefore, n=13 is a winning position.\n\nn=14:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 13 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 10 (losing for opponent). Wait, if you take 4 from 14, you leave 10, which is a losing position. So that's a winning move. Therefore, n=14 is a winning position.\n\nWait, so n=14: taking 4 leaves opponent at 10 (losing). So yes, so n=14 is a winning position.\n\nn=15:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 14 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 11 (winning for opponent). Therefore, both moves leave opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=15 is a losing position.\n\nHmm, so n=15 is losing.\n\nn=16:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 15 (losing for opponent). So that's a winning move. Therefore, n=16 is winning.\n\nn=17:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 16 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 13 (winning for opponent). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=17 is losing?\n\nWait, n=13 is a winning position, so if you take 4 from 17, leaving 13, opponent can win. So yes, both options are bad. Therefore, n=17 is a losing position.\n\nn=18:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 17 (losing for opponent). So that's a winning move. So n=18 is winning.\n\nn=19:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 18 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 15 (losing for opponent). So taking 4 leaves opponent at 15 (losing). So that's a winning move. Therefore, n=19 is a winning position.\n\nn=20:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 19 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 16 (winning for opponent). Both options leave opponent in a winning position, so n=20 is a losing position.\n\nHmm, so the losing positions so far are: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking at these numbers, trying to find a pattern.\n\nLet me list them out up to n=20:\n\nLosing positions: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\nFrom 2 to 5: difference 3\n\n5 to 7: 2\n\n7 to 10: 3\n\n10 to 12: 2\n\n12 to 15: 3\n\n15 to 17: 2\n\n17 to 20: 3\n\nSo the pattern alternates between adding 3 and 2. So 3,2,3,2,3,2,3,...\n\nTherefore, the losing positions seem to follow a pattern where they increase by 3 and 2 alternately.\n\nStarting at 2:\n\n2, +3 \u21925, +2\u21927, +3\u219210, +2\u219212, +3\u219215, +2\u219217, +3\u219220, etc.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are numbers congruent to certain values mod 5?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n2 mod 5 is 2\n\n5 mod 5 is 0\n\n7 mod5 is 2\n\n10 mod5 is 0\n\n12 mod5 is 2\n\n15 mod5 is 0\n\n17 mod5 is 2\n\n20 mod5 is 0\n\nAh! So they alternate between 2 mod5 and 0 mod5. So starting at 2, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5? Wait, let's check:\n\nWait 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, 15 mod5 is 0, 17 mod5 is 2, 20 mod5 is 0. So yes, every number that is 0 or 2 mod5 is a losing position? Wait but 0 mod5 would be 5,10,15,20,... and 2 mod5 is 2,7,12,17,22,... So combining these, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5?\n\nWait, but let's check n=20 is 0 mod5, yes. Let me check n=22. If the pattern continues, 20 +3=23? Wait, no, next after 20 would be 20+2=22 (since the pattern alternates between adding 3 and 2). 22 mod5 is 2, which fits. Then 22+3=25, which is 0 mod5. So yes, that seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Wait but let me confirm with n=23:\n\nn=20 is a losing position. n=21: Take 1 to leave 20 (losing for opponent), so n=21 is a winning position. n=22: Take 1 \u219221 (winning for opponent) or take4 \u219218 (winning for opponent). Wait, so n=22 would be a losing position? Wait, but according to mod5, 22 mod5 is 2, so it should be a losing position, which matches. So yes, seems like the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Hmm, but let's check n=25.\n\nn=25 mod5 is 0, so it should be a losing position. Let's see:\n\nn=25. The current player can take 1, leaving 24. 24 mod5 is 4, which is not a losing position. Alternatively, taking 4 would leave 21, which is 1 mod5, also not a losing position. Wait, but according to our previous idea, n=25 is a losing position. Wait, maybe my assumption is wrong?\n\nWait, let's actually work out n=23, 24, 25:\n\nLet me continue the list up to n=25.\n\nContinuing from n=20 (losing):\n\nn=21: Take 1 \u219220 (losing). So n=21 is a winning position.\n\nn=22: Take 1 \u219221 (winning for opponent). Take4 \u219218 (winning for opponent). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=22 is a losing position. Which matches mod5=2.\n\nn=23: Take1 \u219222 (losing). So n=23 is a winning position.\n\nn=24: Take1 \u219223 (winning for opponent). Take4 \u219220 (losing for opponent). So taking 4 leaves opponent at 20 (a losing position). Therefore, n=24 is a winning position.\n\nWait, but according to mod5, 24 mod5 is 4, so not in 0 or 2. So that's okay.\n\nn=25: Take1 \u219224 (winning for opponent). Take4 \u219221 (winning for opponent). So both moves lead opponent to a winning position. Therefore, n=25 is a losing position. 25 mod5 is 0, so that's consistent.\n\nOkay, so the pattern holds. So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, so that would mean that all n where n mod5 is 0 or 2 are losing positions.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are numbers n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, for the problem, we need to find the number of n \u22642024 where n is a losing position (since the question asks for the number of n where Bob can force a win. Since Bob is the second player, so n must be a losing position for the first player (Alice). So if n is a losing position, then Alice cannot force a win, meaning Bob can. So the answer is the count of n \u22642024 with n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, now, we need to compute the number of integers from 1 to 2024 inclusive that are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, numbers congruent to 0 mod5: these are multiples of 5. The number of such numbers up to 2024 is floor(2024/5). Let's compute that: 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so floor is 404. But 5\u00d7404=2020, so the last multiple is 2020. So total numbers:404.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5: these are numbers like 2,7,12,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nThe sequence is 2 +5k where k\u22650. Let me find the maximum k such that 2+5k \u22642024.\n\n5k \u22642022 \u21d2 k \u22642022/5=404.4. So k=404. So the last term is 2 +5\u00d7404=2+2020=2022. Therefore, the number of terms is 405? Wait, because starting at k=0 (2) up to k=404 (2022). So total terms:405.\n\nWait let me check: For numbers congruent to 2 mod5:\n\nFirst term:2, last term 2022. The number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSimilarly for 0 mod5: first term 5, last term 2020. The number is (2020-5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403+1=404. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore total losing positions up to 2024 are 404+405=809?\n\nWait 404 +405 is 809. But let me verify with an example. Let's check up to n=10:\n\nNumbers up to 10:\n\nLosing positions are 2,5,7,10. That's 4 numbers.\n\nAccording to formula:\n\nNumbers 0 mod5 up to 10: 5,10 \u21922 numbers.\n\nNumbers 2 mod5 up to10:2,7 \u21922 numbers. Total 4, which matches. So the formula works here.\n\nAnother test up to n=7:\n\nLosing positions:2,5,7. Total 3.\n\n0 mod5:5 \u21921\n\n2 mod5:2,7 \u21922. Total 3. Correct.\n\nOkay, so formula holds.\n\nTherefore, for n up to 2024, total losing positions are 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8. So for 0 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 5,10,...,2020. The count is 2020/5=404. Correct.\n\nFor 2 mod5:\n\nNumbers start at 2, each +5. The last term is 2022, which is 2+5*404=2022. So the number of terms is 405 (since starting at k=0). So yes, 405.\n\nThus total is 404 +405=809.\n\nBut let me check whether 2024 is included? Wait, n must be \u22642024. The last term for 2 mod5 is 2022, which is \u22642024, so that's okay. The last term for 0 mod5 is 2020, which is also okay. 2024 mod5 is 2024-5*404=2024-2020=4, so 2024 mod5=4, so it's not included. So total is 809. So the answer should be 809?\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, let me confirm once again:\n\nWait, for numbers congruent to 2 mod5 up to 2024:\n\nThe numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022. The formula is (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1 = 404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nNumbers congruent to 0 mod5 up to 2024: 5,10,...,2020. So (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct.\n\nTotal: 405+404=809. So that should be the answer.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let me compute how many numbers \u22610 or 2 mod5 up to N=2024.\n\nTotal numbers \u22610 mod5: floor(N/5).\n\nTotal numbers \u22612 mod5: floor((N -2)/5) +1, if N >=2.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nFor 0 mod5:\n\nfloor(2024/5)=404.8 floored to 404. So 404 numbers.\n\nFor 2 mod5:\n\nNumbers of the form 5k +2 \u22642024. So 5k \u22642022 \u21d2k \u2264404.4, so k=0,...,404. So 405 numbers.\n\nSo total is 404 +405=809. So that's the same result.\n\nAlternatively, in each block of 5 numbers, there are two losing positions: 0 and 2 mod5. So in each 5 numbers, 2 are losing. So total would be roughly (2024 /5)*2. But since 2024 isn't a multiple of 5, we need to adjust.\n\nLet me see:\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 5 in 2024: 2024 divided by5 is 404 with remainder 4. So 404 complete blocks, each contributing 2 losing numbers, so 404\u00d72=808. Then the remaining 4 numbers (2021,2022,2023,2024). Among these, check which are losing:\n\n2021 mod5: 2020 is 0, so 2021 mod5=1.\n\n2022 mod5=2 \u2192 losing.\n\n2023 mod5=3.\n\n2024 mod5=4.\n\nSo in the last partial block (2021-2024), only 2022 is a losing position. So add 1. So total is 808 +1=809. Yep, same answer. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 809.\n\nWait but hold on, let me check with the initial terms again.\n\nWait in the first 10 numbers (n=1 to10):\n\nLosing positions are 2,5,7,10 \u21924 numbers. According to formula, 10//5=2 blocks. Each block contributes 2, so 2\u00d72=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=7, up to 7: 1 block (5 numbers) plus 2 extra. The first block (1-5) has 2 losing positions (2,5). The next 2 numbers (6,7) have 1 (7). So total 3, which matches. So the formula works.\n\nTherefore, confident that the answer is 809. So I think that's the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{809}\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we need to identify the losing positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win regardless of the opponent's moves. \n\nBy analyzing small values of \\( n \\), we observe the following losing positions: 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, etc. These positions follow a pattern where they are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. \n\nTo confirm this pattern:\n- Numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, ...) are losing positions.\n- Numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 (e.g., 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, ...) are also losing positions.\n\nWe calculate the number of such positions up to 2024:\n1. **Numbers congruent to 0 mod 5**: The largest such number \u2264 2024 is 2020.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem where Alice and Bob are playing a game with a stack of n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the person who takes the last token wins. I need to find how many numbers n \u2264 2024 are such that Bob can always win no matter what Alice does. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that these types of problems are usually approached using dynamic programming or by finding a pattern in the winning and losing positions. A position is a losing position if the current player cannot force a win no matter what the opponent does. Conversely, a winning position means the current player can force a win with the right moves.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the base cases. Let's consider small values of n and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nIf n = 1: Alice takes the last token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.\n\nn = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob. Then Bob is forced to take the last one and win. Wait, no\u2014if Alice takes 1, leaving 1, then Bob takes the last one and wins. But that would mean Alice can't win? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, if Alice takes 1 from 2, leaving 1, then Bob takes the last one and wins. So actually, Alice can't force a win here. Wait, so n=2 would be a losing position for Alice, meaning Bob can win? Wait, no, the player to move is Alice at n=2. So if Alice is at n=2, she can choose to take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, which would let Bob win. Alternatively, she could take 4, but that's not possible since there are only 2. So her only move is to take 1, which allows Bob to win. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for the player who has to move (Alice), so Bob can win if Alice is in n=2. Wait, but actually, the question is about positions where Bob can force a win regardless of Alice's play. So maybe I need to rephrase: For each n, we can label it as a winning or losing position. A winning position means the current player can force a win. A losing position means no matter what the current player does, the opponent can force a win.\n\nTherefore, n=1 is a winning position (current player takes 1 and wins).\n\nn=2: current player can only take 1, leaving 1 for the opponent, who then takes it and wins. Therefore, n=2 is a losing position for the current player.\n\nn=3: Current player can take 1, leaving 2 (a losing position for the opponent). Since leaving the opponent in a losing position means current player can win. So n=3 is a winning position.\n\nWait, let me check again. If current player is at n=3, they can take 1, leaving 2. Since n=2 is a losing position for the next player, so yes, that's a winning move. Therefore n=3 is a winning position.\n\nn=4: Current player can take all 4 and win. So n=4 is a winning position.\n\nn=5: Let's see. The current player can take 1, leaving 4 (which is a winning position for the opponent, since they can take all 4 and win). Alternatively, take 4, leaving 1 (which is a winning position for the opponent as they can take the last one). Therefore, no matter what the current player does, the opponent can win. Therefore n=5 is a losing position.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me confirm that. If n=5, current player's options are:\n\nTake 1: leaves 4. Then opponent can take all 4 and win. So that's bad.\n\nTake 4: leaves 1. Then opponent takes 1 and wins. Also bad. Therefore, no good moves. So n=5 is a losing position for the current player.\n\nn=6: Current player can take 1, leaving 5 (a losing position for opponent). Since n=5 is losing, that's a good move. So n=6 is a winning position.\n\nn=7: Current player can take 1, leaving 6 (which is winning for opponent). Or take 4, leaving 3 (which is a winning position for opponent as well). Wait, so both options lead to opponent winning? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait n=6 is a winning position, so if you leave 6, opponent can win. Similarly, n=3 is also a winning position. Therefore, if current player takes either 1 or 4 from 7, opponent can win. Therefore, n=7 is a losing position?\n\nWait, that seems conflicting. Wait, let's check again:\n\nWait n=7:\n\nTake 1 token, leaving 6 (which is a winning position for opponent, so opponent can win). Take 4 tokens, leaving 3 (also a winning position for opponent). So no matter what, opponent can win. Therefore n=7 is a losing position.\n\nHmm, interesting. So n=5 and n=7 are losing positions so far. Let me continue.\n\nn=8:\n\nCurrent player can take 1, leaving 7 (which is a losing position for opponent). So that's a good move. Therefore, n=8 is a winning position.\n\nn=9:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 8 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 5 (losing for opponent). Wait, if you take 4 from 9, leaving 5, which is a losing position for opponent. So that's a winning move. Therefore n=9 is a winning position (since you can choose to take 4 and leave opponent at 5, which is losing).\n\nWait, so n=9: taking 4 is better. So yes, n=9 is a winning position.\n\nn=10:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 9 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 6 (winning for opponent). Hmm, so both options lead to opponent's win? Wait, but let me check n=6 is a winning position. So if you leave opponent at 9 or 6, which are both winning, so the current player can't force a win. Therefore, n=10 is a losing position?\n\nWait, n=10: options:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 9 (opponent can win by taking 4 to leave 5, which is losing). So opponent can win. Alternatively, take 4 \u2192 6 (opponent can take 1 to leave 5, which is losing). So opponent can also win here. Therefore, n=10 is a losing position.\n\nHmm, so n=5,7,10 are losing positions. Let me see n=11:\n\nn=11: Take 1 \u2192 10 (losing for opponent). So that's a winning move. Therefore n=11 is a winning position.\n\nn=12: Take 1 \u2192 11 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 8 (winning for opponent). Hmm, so both options leave opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=12 is a losing position?\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nWait n=11 is a winning position, so if you take 1 to leave 11, opponent can win. Taking 4 leaves 8, which is a winning position (since from 8 you can take 1 to leave 7, a losing position). Therefore, opponent can win from 8. Therefore, n=12 is a losing position.\n\nContinuing, n=13:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 12 (losing for opponent). So that's a winning move. Therefore, n=13 is a winning position.\n\nn=14:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 13 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 10 (losing for opponent). Wait, if you take 4 from 14, you leave 10, which is a losing position. So that's a winning move. Therefore, n=14 is a winning position.\n\nWait, so n=14: taking 4 leaves opponent at 10 (losing). So yes, so n=14 is a winning position.\n\nn=15:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 14 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 11 (winning for opponent). Therefore, both moves leave opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=15 is a losing position.\n\nHmm, so n=15 is losing.\n\nn=16:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 15 (losing for opponent). So that's a winning move. Therefore, n=16 is winning.\n\nn=17:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 16 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 13 (winning for opponent). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=17 is losing?\n\nWait, n=13 is a winning position, so if you take 4 from 17, leaving 13, opponent can win. So yes, both options are bad. Therefore, n=17 is a losing position.\n\nn=18:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 17 (losing for opponent). So that's a winning move. So n=18 is winning.\n\nn=19:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 18 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 15 (losing for opponent). So taking 4 leaves opponent at 15 (losing). So that's a winning move. Therefore, n=19 is a winning position.\n\nn=20:\n\nTake 1 \u2192 19 (winning for opponent). Take 4 \u2192 16 (winning for opponent). Both options leave opponent in a winning position, so n=20 is a losing position.\n\nHmm, so the losing positions so far are: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking at these numbers, trying to find a pattern.\n\nLet me list them out up to n=20:\n\nLosing positions: 2,5,7,10,12,15,17,20,...\n\nLooking at the differences between consecutive terms:\n\nFrom 2 to 5: difference 3\n\n5 to 7: 2\n\n7 to 10: 3\n\n10 to 12: 2\n\n12 to 15: 3\n\n15 to 17: 2\n\n17 to 20: 3\n\nSo the pattern alternates between adding 3 and 2. So 3,2,3,2,3,2,3,...\n\nTherefore, the losing positions seem to follow a pattern where they increase by 3 and 2 alternately.\n\nStarting at 2:\n\n2, +3 \u21925, +2\u21927, +3\u219210, +2\u219212, +3\u219215, +2\u219217, +3\u219220, etc.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are numbers congruent to certain values mod 5?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n\n2 mod 5 is 2\n\n5 mod 5 is 0\n\n7 mod5 is 2\n\n10 mod5 is 0\n\n12 mod5 is 2\n\n15 mod5 is 0\n\n17 mod5 is 2\n\n20 mod5 is 0\n\nAh! So they alternate between 2 mod5 and 0 mod5. So starting at 2, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5? Wait, let's check:\n\nWait 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, 15 mod5 is 0, 17 mod5 is 2, 20 mod5 is 0. So yes, every number that is 0 or 2 mod5 is a losing position? Wait but 0 mod5 would be 5,10,15,20,... and 2 mod5 is 2,7,12,17,22,... So combining these, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5?\n\nWait, but let's check n=20 is 0 mod5, yes. Let me check n=22. If the pattern continues, 20 +3=23? Wait, no, next after 20 would be 20+2=22 (since the pattern alternates between adding 3 and 2). 22 mod5 is 2, which fits. Then 22+3=25, which is 0 mod5. So yes, that seems to hold.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Wait but let me confirm with n=23:\n\nn=20 is a losing position. n=21: Take 1 to leave 20 (losing for opponent), so n=21 is a winning position. n=22: Take 1 \u219221 (winning for opponent) or take4 \u219218 (winning for opponent). Wait, so n=22 would be a losing position? Wait, but according to mod5, 22 mod5 is 2, so it should be a losing position, which matches. So yes, seems like the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5. Hmm, but let's check n=25.\n\nn=25 mod5 is 0, so it should be a losing position. Let's see:\n\nn=25. The current player can take 1, leaving 24. 24 mod5 is 4, which is not a losing position. Alternatively, taking 4 would leave 21, which is 1 mod5, also not a losing position. Wait, but according to our previous idea, n=25 is a losing position. Wait, maybe my assumption is wrong?\n\nWait, let's actually work out n=23, 24, 25:\n\nLet me continue the list up to n=25.\n\nContinuing from n=20 (losing):\n\nn=21: Take 1 \u219220 (losing). So n=21 is a winning position.\n\nn=22: Take 1 \u219221 (winning for opponent). Take4 \u219218 (winning for opponent). So both options leave opponent in a winning position. Therefore, n=22 is a losing position. Which matches mod5=2.\n\nn=23: Take1 \u219222 (losing). So n=23 is a winning position.\n\nn=24: Take1 \u219223 (winning for opponent). Take4 \u219220 (losing for opponent). So taking 4 leaves opponent at 20 (a losing position). Therefore, n=24 is a winning position.\n\nWait, but according to mod5, 24 mod5 is 4, so not in 0 or 2. So that's okay.\n\nn=25: Take1 \u219224 (winning for opponent). Take4 \u219221 (winning for opponent). So both moves lead opponent to a winning position. Therefore, n=25 is a losing position. 25 mod5 is 0, so that's consistent.\n\nOkay, so the pattern holds. So the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait, so that would mean that all n where n mod5 is 0 or 2 are losing positions.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are numbers n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, for the problem, we need to find the number of n \u22642024 where n is a losing position (since the question asks for the number of n where Bob can force a win. Since Bob is the second player, so n must be a losing position for the first player (Alice). So if n is a losing position, then Alice cannot force a win, meaning Bob can. So the answer is the count of n \u22642024 with n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, now, we need to compute the number of integers from 1 to 2024 inclusive that are congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute this.\n\nFirst, numbers congruent to 0 mod5: these are multiples of 5. The number of such numbers up to 2024 is floor(2024/5). Let's compute that: 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so floor is 404. But 5\u00d7404=2020, so the last multiple is 2020. So total numbers:404.\n\nNumbers congruent to 2 mod5: these are numbers like 2,7,12,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nThe sequence is 2 +5k where k\u22650. Let me find the maximum k such that 2+5k \u22642024.\n\n5k \u22642022 \u21d2 k \u22642022/5=404.4. So k=404. So the last term is 2 +5\u00d7404=2+2020=2022. Therefore, the number of terms is 405? Wait, because starting at k=0 (2) up to k=404 (2022). So total terms:405.\n\nWait let me check: For numbers congruent to 2 mod5:\n\nFirst term:2, last term 2022. The number of terms is ((2022 -2)/5)+1 = (2020/5)+1=404+1=405.\n\nSimilarly for 0 mod5: first term 5, last term 2020. The number is (2020-5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403+1=404. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore total losing positions up to 2024 are 404+405=809?\n\nWait 404 +405 is 809. But let me verify with an example. Let's check up to n=10:\n\nNumbers up to 10:\n\nLosing positions are 2,5,7,10. That's 4 numbers.\n\nAccording to formula:\n\nNumbers 0 mod5 up to 10: 5,10 \u21922 numbers.\n\nNumbers 2 mod5 up to10:2,7 \u21922 numbers. Total 4, which matches. So the formula works here.\n\nAnother test up to n=7:\n\nLosing positions:2,5,7. Total 3.\n\n0 mod5:5 \u21921\n\n2 mod5:2,7 \u21922. Total 3. Correct.\n\nOkay, so formula holds.\n\nTherefore, for n up to 2024, total losing positions are 404 +405=809.\n\nWait, but wait 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8. So for 0 mod5:\n\nNumbers are 5,10,...,2020. The count is 2020/5=404. Correct.\n\nFor 2 mod5:\n\nNumbers start at 2, each +5. The last term is 2022, which is 2+5*404=2022. So the number of terms is 405 (since starting at k=0). So yes, 405.\n\nThus total is 404 +405=809.\n\nBut let me check whether 2024 is included? Wait, n must be \u22642024. The last term for 2 mod5 is 2022, which is \u22642024, so that's okay. The last term for 0 mod5 is 2020, which is also okay. 2024 mod5 is 2024-5*404=2024-2020=4, so 2024 mod5=4, so it's not included. So total is 809. So the answer should be 809?\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, let me confirm once again:\n\nWait, for numbers congruent to 2 mod5 up to 2024:\n\nThe numbers are 2,7,12,...,2022. The formula is (2022 -2)/5 +1 = (2020)/5 +1 = 404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nNumbers congruent to 0 mod5 up to 2024: 5,10,...,2020. So (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1=403 +1=404. Correct.\n\nTotal: 405+404=809. So that should be the answer.\n\nBut let me check another way. Let me compute how many numbers \u22610 or 2 mod5 up to N=2024.\n\nTotal numbers \u22610 mod5: floor(N/5).\n\nTotal numbers \u22612 mod5: floor((N -2)/5) +1, if N >=2.\n\nWait let's see:\n\nFor 0 mod5:\n\nfloor(2024/5)=404.8 floored to 404. So 404 numbers.\n\nFor 2 mod5:\n\nNumbers of the form 5k +2 \u22642024. So 5k \u22642022 \u21d2k \u2264404.4, so k=0,...,404. So 405 numbers.\n\nSo total is 404 +405=809. So that's the same result.\n\nAlternatively, in each block of 5 numbers, there are two losing positions: 0 and 2 mod5. So in each 5 numbers, 2 are losing. So total would be roughly (2024 /5)*2. But since 2024 isn't a multiple of 5, we need to adjust.\n\nLet me see:\n\nNumber of complete blocks of 5 in 2024: 2024 divided by5 is 404 with remainder 4. So 404 complete blocks, each contributing 2 losing numbers, so 404\u00d72=808. Then the remaining 4 numbers (2021,2022,2023,2024). Among these, check which are losing:\n\n2021 mod5: 2020 is 0, so 2021 mod5=1.\n\n2022 mod5=2 \u2192 losing.\n\n2023 mod5=3.\n\n2024 mod5=4.\n\nSo in the last partial block (2021-2024), only 2022 is a losing position. So add 1. So total is 808 +1=809. Yep, same answer. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 809.\n\nWait but hold on, let me check with the initial terms again.\n\nWait in the first 10 numbers (n=1 to10):\n\nLosing positions are 2,5,7,10 \u21924 numbers. According to formula, 10//5=2 blocks. Each block contributes 2, so 2\u00d72=4. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, for n=7, up to 7: 1 block (5 numbers) plus 2 extra. The first block (1-5) has 2 losing positions (2,5). The next 2 numbers (6,7) have 1 (7). So total 3, which matches. So the formula works.\n\nTherefore, confident that the answer is 809. So I think that's the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{809}\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win, we need to identify the losing positions. A losing position is one where the current player cannot force a win regardless of the opponent's moves. \n\nBy analyzing small values of \\( n \\), we observe the following losing positions: 2, 5, 7, 10, 12, 15, 17, 20, etc. These positions follow a pattern where they are congruent to 0 or 2 modulo 5. \n\nTo confirm this pattern:\n- Numbers congruent to 0 mod 5 (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20, ...) are losing positions.\n- Numbers congruent to 2 mod 5 (e.g., 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, ...) are also losing positions.\n\nWe calculate the number of such positions up to 2024:\n1. **Numbers congruent to 0 mod 5**: The largest such number \u2264 2024 is 2020. The count is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2024}{5} \\right\\rfloor = 404 \\).\n2. **Numbers congruent to 2 mod 5**: The largest such number \u2264 2024 is 2022. The count is \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} \\right\\rfloor + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405 \\).\n\nAdding these counts gives the total number of losing positions:\n\\[ 404 + 405 = 809 \\]\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob can guarantee a win is \\(\\boxed{809}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about Alice and Bob playing a game with n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the one who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many numbers n \u2264 2024 are such that Bob can force a win no matter what Alice does. Hmm, so Bob has a winning strategy for those n. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out for which values of n the second player (Bob) can force a win. Since Alice goes first, Bob's winning positions are those where no matter what Alice does (taking 1 or 4), Bob can then move to a position that eventually leads to his victory. \n\nThis sounds like a classic combinatorial game problem. Maybe I can use dynamic programming or look for a pattern in the winning and losing positions. Let's define the positions as winning (W) or losing (L). A position is a losing position if every move from it leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position has at least one move to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the base cases and build up from there.\n\nBase cases:\n- n = 0: The game is over, so this isn't a valid starting position, but maybe useful for reference.\n- n = 1: The first player (Alice) takes the last token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.\n- n = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, but if Alice takes 1, Bob can take the last one. Wait, actually, if Alice takes 1 from 2, leaving 1, then Bob can take that last one and win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, but that's not possible since there are only 2. So Alice must take 1, then Bob wins. Wait, so n=2 would be a losing position for Alice? Because whatever she does, Bob can win. Wait, no. Wait, if Alice is at n=2, she must take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, so Bob takes the last one and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. Therefore, if it's Alice's turn at n=2, she can't win, so Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position (L) for the current player.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nLet me define the positions as follows:\n\n- For a given n, if the current player can force a win, it's a W position. Otherwise, it's an L position.\n\nSo:\n\n- n=0: The game is over, so not a valid position. But if a player is faced with n=0, they lose because they can't make a move. Hmm, maybe better to think of n=0 as a losing position because you can't move, so the previous player won.\n\nBut let me start from n=1 upwards.\n\nn=1: Current player takes 1 and wins. So W.\n\nn=2: Current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who then can take the last token and win. Alternatively, they can't take 4. So the only move is to take 1, leading to opponent's win. Therefore, n=2 is an L position because all moves lead to opponent winning.\n\nWait, but if current player is at n=2, takes 1, opponent gets n=1 and takes it to win. So the current player cannot force a win here, so n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: Current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is L for the opponent). Since the opponent is in an L position, that means current player can force a win by moving to L. Therefore, n=3 is W.\n\nWait, yes. Because if you can move to an L position, you are in a W position. So n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: Current player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So definitely a W position.\n\nn=5: Current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (W for opponent) or take 4, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). Wait, both options leave the opponent in a W position. Therefore, the current player cannot force a win. So n=5 is L?\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nAt n=5, if the current player takes 1, leaving 4, then the opponent can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, if the current player takes 4, leaving 1, the opponent takes 1 and wins. So no matter what the current player does, opponent can win. Therefore, n=5 is an L position.\n\nn=6: Current player can choose to take 1, leaving n=5 (which is L). Since leaving opponent in L is good, so current player can move to L, so n=6 is W.\n\nAlternatively, taking 4 would leave n=2 (which is L as well). Wait, so actually, both moves from n=6 lead to L positions? Wait, n=6-1=5 (L) and n=6-4=2 (L). So both options lead to L. So current player can choose either move and leave opponent in L. So n=6 is definitely W.\n\nWait, but actually, since both moves lead to L, then yes, current player can choose either and win. So n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Let's see. Taking 1 leaves 6 (W) and taking 4 leaves 3 (W). So both options leave opponent in W. Therefore, current player cannot force a win. So n=7 is L?\n\nWait, n=7: if current player takes 1, opponent gets 6 (which is W, so opponent can win from there). If current player takes 4, opponent gets 3 (W, so opponent can win). Therefore, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Let's see. Taking 1 leaves 7 (L), so current player can do that and leave opponent in L. Therefore n=8 is W.\n\nSimilarly, taking 4 from 8 leaves 4, which is a W position for opponent (since they can take all 4 and win). But since there's at least one move to L (taking 1 to 7), n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Taking 1 leaves 8 (W), taking 4 leaves 5 (L). Wait, so if current player takes 4, leaving 5 (L). So they can choose that move, so n=9 is W.\n\nWait, yes. Because moving to L is possible, so n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Let's see. Taking 1 leaves 9 (W), taking 4 leaves 6 (W). Both moves lead to W for opponent. Therefore, n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, so the pattern so far:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nResult: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, let me list them properly starting from n=1:\n\nn=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10:L\n\nHmm, so the losing positions (L) are at n=2,5,7,10,...\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's see the differences between the L positions:\n\n2,5,7,10... The differences between them are 3,2,3,...\n\nHmm, maybe the L positions are numbers congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5? Wait let's check:\n\nWait 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0. Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively maybe another modulus.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the sequence of L positions: 2,5,7,10,12,15,... Maybe every 3 steps? Let me check n=11,12,...\n\nContinuing the analysis:\n\nn=11: current player can take 1 to 10 (L) or take 4 to 7 (L). Both moves lead to L positions. Wait, so if both moves lead to L, then the current player can choose either and leave opponent in L, which would mean n=11 is W? Wait, no, wait: If you can move to L, then current position is W. So if both moves lead to L, then current is W. Wait, but in n=5, moving to n=4 (W) or n=1 (W). Wait, but in n=5, both moves lead to W, so n=5 is L. Wait, so the rule is: if all moves lead to W, then current is L. If there exists a move to L, then current is W.\n\nSo for n=11:\n\nTaking 1 from 11 leaves 10, which is L. So since there exists a move to L, then n=11 is W.\n\nWait, so n=11 is W. Hmm.\n\nWait let me recast the analysis step by step for n=11:\n\nAt n=11, possible moves:\n\n- Take 1: 11-1=10, which is L. So opponent is in L, so current player can force a win by moving here. Therefore, n=11 is W.\n\nSimilarly, taking 4 would leave 7, which is L as well. So both moves lead to L, so n=11 is W.\n\nWait, so then maybe my earlier thought was wrong. Wait let's check n=10 again:\n\nn=10: taking 1 leads to 9 (W), taking 4 leads to 6 (W). So both moves leave opponent in W, so n=10 is L. Correct.\n\nContinuing:\n\nn=11: W\n\nn=12: Let's see. Possible moves:\n\nTake 1 to 11 (W), or take 4 to 8 (W). Both moves lead to W. Therefore, n=12 is L.\n\nWait, so n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: Take 1 to 12 (L) or take 4 to 9 (W). Since there is a move to L (taking 1), then n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: Take 1 to 13 (W) or take 4 to 10 (L). So taking 4 leads to L, so n=14 is W.\n\nWait, taking 4 from 14 gives 10, which is L. Therefore, current can move to L, so n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: Take 1 to 14 (W) or take 4 to 11 (W). Both moves lead to W, so n=15 is L.\n\nHmm, so the L positions so far are 2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nLooking at these numbers:\n\n2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nLooking at the differences between them:\n\nFrom 2 to5: +3\n\n5 to7: +2\n\n7 to10:+3\n\n10 to12:+2\n\n12 to15:+3\n\nSo alternating between adding 3 and 2. That suggests a cycle of 5? Let's see:\n\nLooking at modulo 5:\n\n2 mod5=2\n\n5 mod5=0\n\n7 mod5=2\n\n10 mod5=0\n\n12 mod5=2\n\n15 mod5=0\n\nSo the L positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5? Wait:\n\nWait 5 mod5 is 0, 10 mod5 is 0, 15 mod5 is 0. So 0 mod5.\n\nAnd 2,7,12,17,... which are 2 mod5. So yes, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5?\n\nWait 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, 15 mod5 is 0. So that seems like L positions are n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut let me check n=17:\n\nIf n=17, then 17 mod5 is 2. Let's see if it's L.\n\nn=17: Let's see. Take 1 to 16, or take4 to13.\n\nIf n=16, what is its status? Let me see.\n\nWait maybe I need to continue the sequence up to n=15 and see:\n\nWait let's do n=16:\n\nn=16: moves to 15 (L) or 12 (L). Since both moves lead to L? Wait, if current player can move to L, then n=16 is W. Because moving to L gives opponent a losing position.\n\nWait, so n=16: taking 1 leads to 15 (L), so current can do that, so n=16 is W.\n\nn=17: moves to 16 (W) or 13 (W). Both moves leave opponent in W, so n=17 is L. Which matches 17 mod5=2, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=18: moves to 17 (L) or 14 (W). Since there's a move to L (taking1), so n=18 is W.\n\nn=19: moves to 18 (W) or 15 (L). Taking4 to15 (L) so n=19 is W.\n\nn=20: moves to 19 (W) or 16 (W). Both lead to W, so n=20 is L (20 mod5=0).\n\nSo yes, the pattern holds. The losing positions (L) are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait let me confirm with n=21:\n\n21 mod5 is 1. Let's see:\n\nn=21: move to 20 (L) or 17 (L). So both moves lead to L. Wait, so current player can move to L, so n=21 is W. Hmm, but 21 mod5 is 1, so that's okay.\n\nWait n=20 is L, n=21 is W. Correct.\n\nWait n=22: 22 mod5 is 2, so should be L. Let's check:\n\nn=22: moving to 21 (W) or 18 (W). Both moves lead to W, so n=22 is L. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Therefore, for any n, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position. So the current player cannot force a win. Therefore, if the starting n is a losing position, then the first player (Alice) will lose if Bob plays optimally. Therefore, the numbers n where Bob can force a win are exactly the losing positions for the first player, i.e., n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, we need to count the numbers \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting numbers from 1 to 2024 inclusive congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5 and \u22612 mod5, then add them.\n\nFirst, numbers \u22610 mod5: these are 5,10,15,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: 2,7,12,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nCompute each count separately.\n\nFirst, for numbers \u22610 mod5:\n\nThe sequence is 5,10,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe maximum number \u22610 mod5 \u22642024 is 2020, since 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 5\u00d7404=2020.\n\nThe count is 2020/5 = 404 numbers.\n\nWait, but starting from 5, so terms are 5\u00d71, 5\u00d72,...,5\u00d7404. So yes, 404 terms.\n\nFor numbers \u22612 mod5:\n\nThese are 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nFirst term is 2, then each subsequent term is +5.\n\nThe general term is 5k + 2, where k starts at 0.\n\nFind the maximum n=5k+2 \u22642024.\n\nSo 5k +2 \u22642024 \u2192 5k \u22642022 \u2192k \u22642022/5=404.4.\n\nThus, the maximum k is 404, so the last term is 5\u00d7404 +2 =2020 +2=2022.\n\nTherefore, the number of terms is k from 0 to 404, which is 405 terms.\n\nWait let me confirm:\n\nFirst term: k=0: 2\n\nLast term: k=404: 5\u00d7404 +2=2022.\n\nTherefore, number of terms is 404+1=405.\n\nTherefore total numbers where Bob can force a win are 404 +405= 809.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if n=0 is included. Wait the problem says positive integers n less than or equal to 2024. So starting from n=1.\n\nBut in the count for \u22610 mod5, the first term is 5 (since n=0 is excluded). So 5 to 2020, which is 404 terms (since 2020/5=404).\n\nFor the \u22612 mod5, the first term is 2, which is allowed (n=2 is a positive integer). The last term is 2022, so 405 terms. So total is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait but let me check with n=2, which is included. Let's check a smaller number to confirm counts.\n\nSuppose n up to 10:\n\nNumbers where Bob can win: 2,5,7,10. That's 4 numbers.\n\nCompute via formula:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 up to 10: 5,10 \u21922 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 up to 10:2,7 \u21922 numbers.\n\nTotal 4, which matches. So the formula works here.\n\nAnother test: up to n=7.\n\nNumbers:2,5,7. So 3 numbers.\n\nFormula:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 up to7:5 \u21921\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 up to7:2,7 \u21922 (Wait 7 mod5 is 2, yes). So total 1+2=3, which matches.\n\nThus, formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total is 404 +405=809. Wait but let me check 404+405 is indeed 809? 400+400=800, plus 4+5=9, total 809. Yes.\n\nBut wait, let me check the count for numbers \u22612 mod5 again.\n\nThe first term is 2 (k=0), then each term is 5 more. The nth term is 2 +5*(k). To get up to 2024:\n\nThe last term is 2022, which is 2 +5*404=2022. So k from 0 to 404 is 405 terms. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for the 0 mod5:\n\nFirst term 5 (k=1 to 404 terms?), wait, 5*1 up to 5*404. So 404 terms. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 404+405=809. So the answer should be 809?\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait let me check n=2 is included, which is correct. But let me check if 2022 is indeed \u22642024. Yes, 2022 is 2 less than 2024. So that is okay.\n\nWait but 2024 itself: 2024 mod5. Let me compute 2024 divided by 5: 5\u00d7404=2020, so 2024-2020=4. So 2024 mod5 is 4. So 2024 is not in either of the classes 0 or 2 mod5, so it's not counted. So the maximum in the 0 mod5 is 2020, and 2 mod5 is 2022. So counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 809. But let me verify once more with another example.\n\nTake n=12. 12 mod5 is 2, so it should be counted. Yes, in the list above, n=12 was an L position. Correct. Similarly n=15 mod5=0, which is L. Correct.\n\nWait but hang on. Let me think again: the question is asking for the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win. Since Bob is the second player, those are exactly the losing positions for the first player (Alice). So when n is a losing position (L), Alice cannot force a win, so Bob can. Therefore, the count is the number of L positions from 1 to 2024. Which are numbers \u22610 or 2 mod5. So the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 809. Wait, but let me recalculate the numbers just to be sure.\n\nFor numbers \u22610 mod5:\n\nFirst term 5, last term 2020. The number of terms is (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1 =403 +1=404. Correct.\n\nFor numbers \u22612 mod5:\n\nFirst term 2, last term 2022. Number of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1 =2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nTotal terms:404+405=809. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check n=2. Since n=2 is included, which is a losing position, so Bob can win. That's correct. Similarly n=5, etc. So yes. The total is 809. Therefore, the answer should be 809. Hmm, but I have a nagging doubt because sometimes when counting inclusive ranges, off-by-one errors can happen. Let me check with n=2 to n=7:\n\nNumbers:2,5,7. So from 1-7, there are 3 losing positions. The formula would give:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 up to7: 5 (1 term)\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 up to7:2,7 (2 terms). Total 3, which matches. So that works.\n\nAnother test with n=10:\n\nNumbers up to10: 2,5,7,10 (4 terms). The formula gives:\n\n0 mod5:5,10 (2 terms)\n\n2 mod5:2,7 (2 terms). Total 4. Correct.\n\nAnother test n=12:\n\nUp to12: 2,5,7,10,12 (5 terms). Formula:\n\n0 mod5:5,10 (2)\n\n2 mod5:2,7,12 (3 terms). Total 5. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula works. So I think the answer is 809. Wait, but let me check the arithmetic again for the total:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: 404\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:405\n\nTotal 404 +405=809. Yes.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me compute 2024 divided by 5.\n\n2024 divided by 5 is 404.8. So the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5)=404.8 floored to 404, but since 5\u00d7404=2020 which is \u22642024, that's correct. So the count for 0 mod5 is 404.\n\nFor numbers \u22612 mod5: The numbers are 2,7,...,2022. The count is floor((2022 -2)/5)+1= floor(2020/5)+1=404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nThus, the answer is 809. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{809}\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions (L positions) in the game.

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. The problem is about Alice and Bob playing a game with n tokens. They take turns removing either 1 or 4 tokens, and the one who takes the last token wins. We need to find how many numbers n \u2264 2024 are such that Bob can force a win no matter what Alice does. Hmm, so Bob has a winning strategy for those n. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out for which values of n the second player (Bob) can force a win. Since Alice goes first, Bob's winning positions are those where no matter what Alice does (taking 1 or 4), Bob can then move to a position that eventually leads to his victory. \n\nThis sounds like a classic combinatorial game problem. Maybe I can use dynamic programming or look for a pattern in the winning and losing positions. Let's define the positions as winning (W) or losing (L). A position is a losing position if every move from it leads to a winning position for the opponent. Conversely, a winning position has at least one move to a losing position for the opponent.\n\nLet me start by figuring out the base cases and build up from there.\n\nBase cases:\n- n = 0: The game is over, so this isn't a valid starting position, but maybe useful for reference.\n- n = 1: The first player (Alice) takes the last token and wins. So n=1 is a winning position for Alice.\n- n = 2: Alice can take 1 token, leaving 1 for Bob, who then takes it and wins. Wait, but if Alice takes 1, Bob can take the last one. Wait, actually, if Alice takes 1 from 2, leaving 1, then Bob can take that last one and win. Alternatively, if Alice takes 4, but that's not possible since there are only 2. So Alice must take 1, then Bob wins. Wait, so n=2 would be a losing position for Alice? Because whatever she does, Bob can win. Wait, no. Wait, if Alice is at n=2, she must take 1, leaving 1 for Bob, so Bob takes the last one and wins. So n=2 is a losing position for the player whose turn it is. Therefore, if it's Alice's turn at n=2, she can't win, so Bob can win. So n=2 is a losing position (L) for the current player.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nLet me define the positions as follows:\n\n- For a given n, if the current player can force a win, it's a W position. Otherwise, it's an L position.\n\nSo:\n\n- n=0: The game is over, so not a valid position. But if a player is faced with n=0, they lose because they can't make a move. Hmm, maybe better to think of n=0 as a losing position because you can't move, so the previous player won.\n\nBut let me start from n=1 upwards.\n\nn=1: Current player takes 1 and wins. So W.\n\nn=2: Current player can take 1, leaving n=1 for the opponent, who then can take the last token and win. Alternatively, they can't take 4. So the only move is to take 1, leading to opponent's win. Therefore, n=2 is an L position because all moves lead to opponent winning.\n\nWait, but if current player is at n=2, takes 1, opponent gets n=1 and takes it to win. So the current player cannot force a win here, so n=2 is L.\n\nn=3: Current player can take 1, leaving n=2 (which is L for the opponent). Since the opponent is in an L position, that means current player can force a win by moving to L. Therefore, n=3 is W.\n\nWait, yes. Because if you can move to an L position, you are in a W position. So n=3 is W.\n\nn=4: Current player can take 4 tokens and win immediately. So definitely a W position.\n\nn=5: Current player can take 1, leaving n=4 (W for opponent) or take 4, leaving n=1 (W for opponent). Wait, both options leave the opponent in a W position. Therefore, the current player cannot force a win. So n=5 is L?\n\nWait, let's check:\n\nAt n=5, if the current player takes 1, leaving 4, then the opponent can take all 4 and win. Alternatively, if the current player takes 4, leaving 1, the opponent takes 1 and wins. So no matter what the current player does, opponent can win. Therefore, n=5 is an L position.\n\nn=6: Current player can choose to take 1, leaving n=5 (which is L). Since leaving opponent in L is good, so current player can move to L, so n=6 is W.\n\nAlternatively, taking 4 would leave n=2 (which is L as well). Wait, so actually, both moves from n=6 lead to L positions? Wait, n=6-1=5 (L) and n=6-4=2 (L). So both options lead to L. So current player can choose either move and leave opponent in L. So n=6 is definitely W.\n\nWait, but actually, since both moves lead to L, then yes, current player can choose either and win. So n=6 is W.\n\nn=7: Let's see. Taking 1 leaves 6 (W) and taking 4 leaves 3 (W). So both options leave opponent in W. Therefore, current player cannot force a win. So n=7 is L?\n\nWait, n=7: if current player takes 1, opponent gets 6 (which is W, so opponent can win from there). If current player takes 4, opponent gets 3 (W, so opponent can win). Therefore, n=7 is L.\n\nn=8: Let's see. Taking 1 leaves 7 (L), so current player can do that and leave opponent in L. Therefore n=8 is W.\n\nSimilarly, taking 4 from 8 leaves 4, which is a W position for opponent (since they can take all 4 and win). But since there's at least one move to L (taking 1 to 7), n=8 is W.\n\nn=9: Taking 1 leaves 8 (W), taking 4 leaves 5 (L). Wait, so if current player takes 4, leaving 5 (L). So they can choose that move, so n=9 is W.\n\nWait, yes. Because moving to L is possible, so n=9 is W.\n\nn=10: Let's see. Taking 1 leaves 9 (W), taking 4 leaves 6 (W). Both moves lead to W for opponent. Therefore, n=10 is L.\n\nHmm, so the pattern so far:\n\nn : 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nResult: L W L W W L W L W W L\n\nWait, let me list them properly starting from n=1:\n\nn=1: W\n\nn=2: L\n\nn=3: W\n\nn=4: W\n\nn=5: L\n\nn=6: W\n\nn=7: L\n\nn=8: W\n\nn=9: W\n\nn=10:L\n\nHmm, so the losing positions (L) are at n=2,5,7,10,...\n\nLooking for a pattern here. Let's see the differences between the L positions:\n\n2,5,7,10... The differences between them are 3,2,3,...\n\nHmm, maybe the L positions are numbers congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5? Wait let's check:\n\nWait 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0. Hmm, not exactly. Alternatively maybe another modulus.\n\nAlternatively, let's see the sequence of L positions: 2,5,7,10,12,15,... Maybe every 3 steps? Let me check n=11,12,...\n\nContinuing the analysis:\n\nn=11: current player can take 1 to 10 (L) or take 4 to 7 (L). Both moves lead to L positions. Wait, so if both moves lead to L, then the current player can choose either and leave opponent in L, which would mean n=11 is W? Wait, no, wait: If you can move to L, then current position is W. So if both moves lead to L, then current is W. Wait, but in n=5, moving to n=4 (W) or n=1 (W). Wait, but in n=5, both moves lead to W, so n=5 is L. Wait, so the rule is: if all moves lead to W, then current is L. If there exists a move to L, then current is W.\n\nSo for n=11:\n\nTaking 1 from 11 leaves 10, which is L. So since there exists a move to L, then n=11 is W.\n\nWait, so n=11 is W. Hmm.\n\nWait let me recast the analysis step by step for n=11:\n\nAt n=11, possible moves:\n\n- Take 1: 11-1=10, which is L. So opponent is in L, so current player can force a win by moving here. Therefore, n=11 is W.\n\nSimilarly, taking 4 would leave 7, which is L as well. So both moves lead to L, so n=11 is W.\n\nWait, so then maybe my earlier thought was wrong. Wait let's check n=10 again:\n\nn=10: taking 1 leads to 9 (W), taking 4 leads to 6 (W). So both moves leave opponent in W, so n=10 is L. Correct.\n\nContinuing:\n\nn=11: W\n\nn=12: Let's see. Possible moves:\n\nTake 1 to 11 (W), or take 4 to 8 (W). Both moves lead to W. Therefore, n=12 is L.\n\nWait, so n=12 is L.\n\nn=13: Take 1 to 12 (L) or take 4 to 9 (W). Since there is a move to L (taking 1), then n=13 is W.\n\nn=14: Take 1 to 13 (W) or take 4 to 10 (L). So taking 4 leads to L, so n=14 is W.\n\nWait, taking 4 from 14 gives 10, which is L. Therefore, current can move to L, so n=14 is W.\n\nn=15: Take 1 to 14 (W) or take 4 to 11 (W). Both moves lead to W, so n=15 is L.\n\nHmm, so the L positions so far are 2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nLooking at these numbers:\n\n2,5,7,10,12,15,...\n\nLooking at the differences between them:\n\nFrom 2 to5: +3\n\n5 to7: +2\n\n7 to10:+3\n\n10 to12:+2\n\n12 to15:+3\n\nSo alternating between adding 3 and 2. That suggests a cycle of 5? Let's see:\n\nLooking at modulo 5:\n\n2 mod5=2\n\n5 mod5=0\n\n7 mod5=2\n\n10 mod5=0\n\n12 mod5=2\n\n15 mod5=0\n\nSo the L positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5? Wait:\n\nWait 5 mod5 is 0, 10 mod5 is 0, 15 mod5 is 0. So 0 mod5.\n\nAnd 2,7,12,17,... which are 2 mod5. So yes, the losing positions are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5?\n\nWait 2 mod5 is 2, 5 mod5 is 0, 7 mod5 is 2, 10 mod5 is 0, 12 mod5 is 2, 15 mod5 is 0. So that seems like L positions are n \u2261 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nBut let me check n=17:\n\nIf n=17, then 17 mod5 is 2. Let's see if it's L.\n\nn=17: Let's see. Take 1 to 16, or take4 to13.\n\nIf n=16, what is its status? Let me see.\n\nWait maybe I need to continue the sequence up to n=15 and see:\n\nWait let's do n=16:\n\nn=16: moves to 15 (L) or 12 (L). Since both moves lead to L? Wait, if current player can move to L, then n=16 is W. Because moving to L gives opponent a losing position.\n\nWait, so n=16: taking 1 leads to 15 (L), so current can do that, so n=16 is W.\n\nn=17: moves to 16 (W) or 13 (W). Both moves leave opponent in W, so n=17 is L. Which matches 17 mod5=2, so that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, n=18: moves to 17 (L) or 14 (W). Since there's a move to L (taking1), so n=18 is W.\n\nn=19: moves to 18 (W) or 15 (L). Taking4 to15 (L) so n=19 is W.\n\nn=20: moves to 19 (W) or 16 (W). Both lead to W, so n=20 is L (20 mod5=0).\n\nSo yes, the pattern holds. The losing positions (L) are numbers congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nWait let me confirm with n=21:\n\n21 mod5 is 1. Let's see:\n\nn=21: move to 20 (L) or 17 (L). So both moves lead to L. Wait, so current player can move to L, so n=21 is W. Hmm, but 21 mod5 is 1, so that's okay.\n\nWait n=20 is L, n=21 is W. Correct.\n\nWait n=22: 22 mod5 is 2, so should be L. Let's check:\n\nn=22: moving to 21 (W) or 18 (W). Both moves lead to W, so n=22 is L. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the losing positions are n \u22610 or 2 mod5. Therefore, for any n, if n mod5 is 0 or 2, then it's a losing position. So the current player cannot force a win. Therefore, if the starting n is a losing position, then the first player (Alice) will lose if Bob plays optimally. Therefore, the numbers n where Bob can force a win are exactly the losing positions for the first player, i.e., n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nTherefore, we need to count the numbers \u22642024 where n \u22610 or 2 mod5.\n\nSo the problem reduces to counting numbers from 1 to 2024 inclusive congruent to 0 or 2 mod5.\n\nLet me compute how many numbers \u22642024 are \u22610 mod5 and \u22612 mod5, then add them.\n\nFirst, numbers \u22610 mod5: these are 5,10,15,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nSimilarly, numbers \u22612 mod5: 2,7,12,..., up to the largest \u22642024.\n\nCompute each count separately.\n\nFirst, for numbers \u22610 mod5:\n\nThe sequence is 5,10,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nThe maximum number \u22610 mod5 \u22642024 is 2020, since 2024 divided by 5 is 404.8, so 5\u00d7404=2020.\n\nThe count is 2020/5 = 404 numbers.\n\nWait, but starting from 5, so terms are 5\u00d71, 5\u00d72,...,5\u00d7404. So yes, 404 terms.\n\nFor numbers \u22612 mod5:\n\nThese are 2,7,12,..., up to the maximum \u22642024.\n\nFirst term is 2, then each subsequent term is +5.\n\nThe general term is 5k + 2, where k starts at 0.\n\nFind the maximum n=5k+2 \u22642024.\n\nSo 5k +2 \u22642024 \u2192 5k \u22642022 \u2192k \u22642022/5=404.4.\n\nThus, the maximum k is 404, so the last term is 5\u00d7404 +2 =2020 +2=2022.\n\nTherefore, the number of terms is k from 0 to 404, which is 405 terms.\n\nWait let me confirm:\n\nFirst term: k=0: 2\n\nLast term: k=404: 5\u00d7404 +2=2022.\n\nTherefore, number of terms is 404+1=405.\n\nTherefore total numbers where Bob can force a win are 404 +405= 809.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check if n=0 is included. Wait the problem says positive integers n less than or equal to 2024. So starting from n=1.\n\nBut in the count for \u22610 mod5, the first term is 5 (since n=0 is excluded). So 5 to 2020, which is 404 terms (since 2020/5=404).\n\nFor the \u22612 mod5, the first term is 2, which is allowed (n=2 is a positive integer). The last term is 2022, so 405 terms. So total is 404 +405=809.\n\nWait but let me check with n=2, which is included. Let's check a smaller number to confirm counts.\n\nSuppose n up to 10:\n\nNumbers where Bob can win: 2,5,7,10. That's 4 numbers.\n\nCompute via formula:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 up to 10: 5,10 \u21922 numbers.\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 up to 10:2,7 \u21922 numbers.\n\nTotal 4, which matches. So the formula works here.\n\nAnother test: up to n=7.\n\nNumbers:2,5,7. So 3 numbers.\n\nFormula:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 up to7:5 \u21921\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 up to7:2,7 \u21922 (Wait 7 mod5 is 2, yes). So total 1+2=3, which matches.\n\nThus, formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, the total is 404 +405=809. Wait but let me check 404+405 is indeed 809? 400+400=800, plus 4+5=9, total 809. Yes.\n\nBut wait, let me check the count for numbers \u22612 mod5 again.\n\nThe first term is 2 (k=0), then each term is 5 more. The nth term is 2 +5*(k). To get up to 2024:\n\nThe last term is 2022, which is 2 +5*404=2022. So k from 0 to 404 is 405 terms. Correct.\n\nSimilarly for the 0 mod5:\n\nFirst term 5 (k=1 to 404 terms?), wait, 5*1 up to 5*404. So 404 terms. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the total number is 404+405=809. So the answer should be 809?\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait let me check n=2 is included, which is correct. But let me check if 2022 is indeed \u22642024. Yes, 2022 is 2 less than 2024. So that is okay.\n\nWait but 2024 itself: 2024 mod5. Let me compute 2024 divided by 5: 5\u00d7404=2020, so 2024-2020=4. So 2024 mod5 is 4. So 2024 is not in either of the classes 0 or 2 mod5, so it's not counted. So the maximum in the 0 mod5 is 2020, and 2 mod5 is 2022. So counts are correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 809. But let me verify once more with another example.\n\nTake n=12. 12 mod5 is 2, so it should be counted. Yes, in the list above, n=12 was an L position. Correct. Similarly n=15 mod5=0, which is L. Correct.\n\nWait but hang on. Let me think again: the question is asking for the number of n \u22642024 where Bob can force a win. Since Bob is the second player, those are exactly the losing positions for the first player (Alice). So when n is a losing position (L), Alice cannot force a win, so Bob can. Therefore, the count is the number of L positions from 1 to 2024. Which are numbers \u22610 or 2 mod5. So the calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 809. Wait, but let me recalculate the numbers just to be sure.\n\nFor numbers \u22610 mod5:\n\nFirst term 5, last term 2020. The number of terms is (2020 -5)/5 +1 = (2015)/5 +1 =403 +1=404. Correct.\n\nFor numbers \u22612 mod5:\n\nFirst term 2, last term 2022. Number of terms: (2022 -2)/5 +1 =2020/5 +1=404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nTotal terms:404+405=809. So that seems correct.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check n=2. Since n=2 is included, which is a losing position, so Bob can win. That's correct. Similarly n=5, etc. So yes. The total is 809. Therefore, the answer should be 809. Hmm, but I have a nagging doubt because sometimes when counting inclusive ranges, off-by-one errors can happen. Let me check with n=2 to n=7:\n\nNumbers:2,5,7. So from 1-7, there are 3 losing positions. The formula would give:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5 up to7: 5 (1 term)\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5 up to7:2,7 (2 terms). Total 3, which matches. So that works.\n\nAnother test with n=10:\n\nNumbers up to10: 2,5,7,10 (4 terms). The formula gives:\n\n0 mod5:5,10 (2 terms)\n\n2 mod5:2,7 (2 terms). Total 4. Correct.\n\nAnother test n=12:\n\nUp to12: 2,5,7,10,12 (5 terms). Formula:\n\n0 mod5:5,10 (2)\n\n2 mod5:2,7,12 (3 terms). Total 5. Correct.\n\nTherefore, the formula works. So I think the answer is 809. Wait, but let me check the arithmetic again for the total:\n\nNumbers \u22610 mod5: 404\n\nNumbers \u22612 mod5:405\n\nTotal 404 +405=809. Yes.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me compute 2024 divided by 5.\n\n2024 divided by 5 is 404.8. So the number of multiples of 5 up to 2024 is floor(2024/5)=404.8 floored to 404, but since 5\u00d7404=2020 which is \u22642024, that's correct. So the count for 0 mod5 is 404.\n\nFor numbers \u22612 mod5: The numbers are 2,7,...,2022. The count is floor((2022 -2)/5)+1= floor(2020/5)+1=404 +1=405. Correct.\n\nThus, the answer is 809. Therefore, I think that is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{809}\n\n\nTo determine the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy, we need to identify the losing positions (L positions) in the game. A position \\( n \\) is an L position if every possible move from \\( n \\) leads to a winning position (W position) for the opponent. \n\nBy analyzing the game, we find that the losing positions occur at \\( n \\equiv 0 \\) or \\( 2 \\pmod{5} \\). \n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Identify Losing Positions**:\n   - A position \\( n \\) is a losing position if \\( n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{5} \\) or \\( n \\equiv 2 \\pmod{5} \\).\n\n2. **Count Numbers Congruent to 0 mod 5**:\n   - The sequence is \\( 5, 10, 15, \\ldots, 2020 \\).\n   - The number of terms is \\( \\frac{2020}{5} = 404 \\).\n\n3. **Count Numbers Congruent to 2 mod 5**:\n   - The sequence is \\( 2, 7, 12, \\ldots, 2022 \\).\n   - The number of terms is \\( \\frac{2022 - 2}{5} + 1 = \\frac{2020}{5} + 1 = 404 + 1 = 405 \\).\n\n4. **Sum the Counts**:\n   - Total losing positions = \\( 404 + 405 = 809 \\).\n\nThus, the number of positive integers \\( n \\) less than or equal to 2024 for which Bob has a winning strategy is \\(\\boxed{809}\\).",
