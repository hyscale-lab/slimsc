      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain all rectangular boxes in set B, which have a surface area of 54 and volume of 23. Then, compute r squared and express it as a fraction p/q, finally finding p + q. Hmm, let me start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, the problem is about rectangular boxes with given surface area and volume. The sphere that can contain each of these boxes must have a radius at least as large as half the space diagonal of the box. Because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box, so the sphere needs to have a diameter at least equal to that diagonal. Therefore, the minimal radius r would be half of the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in set B. So, the key is to find the maximum possible space diagonal of a box with surface area 54 and volume 23, then divide that by 2 and square it for r squared.\n\nWait, but actually, since we need the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes in B, the sphere must be able to contain all possible such boxes. So actually, the radius has to be at least as large as the maximum space diagonal divided by 2 over all boxes in B. Therefore, the minimal such r is the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. So we need to maximize the space diagonal given the constraints of surface area and volume. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to: given a rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23, find the maximum possible space diagonal. Then r is half of that, and r squared is (space diagonal squared)/4. So, first, I need to maximize the space diagonal of the box under the constraints of surface area and volume. \n\nLet me denote the edge lengths of the box as a, b, c. Then the surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, so ab + bc + ac = 27. The volume is abc = 23. The space diagonal is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Therefore, to maximize the space diagonal, we need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given the constraints ab + bc + ac =27 and abc =23.\n\nHmm, okay, so how do I maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers? But perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since it's a problem with symmetric constraints, maybe we can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac). Since (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac). Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac). Since ab + bc + ac is given as 27, so that's (a + b + c)^2 - 54. Therefore, maximizing a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is equivalent to maximizing (a + b + c)^2. Therefore, to maximize the space diagonal squared (and thus the space diagonal), we need to maximize a + b + c. So the problem reduces to maximizing a + b + c given that ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23. \n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a way to parameterize the variables. Let me think. Since we have three variables with two equations, we can perhaps express one variable in terms of the others and substitute. Alternatively, maybe using inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, since we have three variables with symmetric constraints, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Maybe, but I need to verify.\n\nLet me consider variables a, b, c with abc =23 and ab + bc + ac =27. Let me denote variables as x, y, z for simplicity. Let me suppose that two variables are equal. Let's suppose a = b. Then, we can set a = b, so the equations become:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac =27,\n\nand a\u00b2 c =23.\n\nLet me denote a as a variable, then c can be expressed from the second equation: c =23/(a\u00b2). Substitute into the first equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2a*(23/(a\u00b2)) =27,\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2 + (46)/a =27.\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na\u00b3 + 46 =27a,\n\nThus, a\u00b3 -27a +46=0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me try possible rational roots. The possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nTesting a=2: 8 -54 +46 =0. 8 -54 is -46 +46=0. So a=2 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (a -2)(a\u00b2 + 2a -23)=0. The quadratic equation a\u00b2 + 2a -23 =0 has roots [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since lengths are positive, the other roots would be negative, so the only positive real root is a=2. \n\nTherefore, when a = b =2, then c=23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75. Then, the sum a + b + c is 2 +2 +5.75=9.75=39/4. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider other possibilities where variables are not equal, perhaps the sum a + b + c can be larger?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when variables are unequal. Let me see. Let's suppose that variables are not equal, but maybe one variable is very small. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum of a + b + c occurs when two variables are as large as possible and one is small? Hmm, but constrained by the product and the sum of products.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote the function to maximize as f(a,b,c) = a + b + c. The constraints are:\n\ng1(a,b,c) = ab + bc + ac -27 =0,\n\ng2(a,b,c) = abc -23 =0.\n\nSo, we need to maximize f with constraints g1=0 and g2=0.\n\nThe Lagrangian is L = a + b + c - \u03bb(ab + bc + ac -27) - \u03bc(abc -23).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\ndL/da = 1 - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc =0,\n\ndL/db =1 - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac =0,\n\ndL/dc =1 - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc ab =0,\n\nAlso, the constraints:\n\nab + bc + ac =27,\n\nabc=23.\n\nHmm, so the partial derivatives give three equations:\n\n1 - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc =0,\n\n1 - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac =0,\n\n1 - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc ab =0.\n\nHmm, let's see if we can find symmetry here. Suppose that a = b = c, but in that case, the volume would be a\u00b3 =23, so a = cube root of 23 \u22482.843, but then surface area would be 6a\u00b2 \u22486*(23^(2/3))\u2248?\n\nWait, let me compute surface area if a = b =c. Let me see:\n\nIf a = b =c, then 6a\u00b2 = surface area. But surface area is given as 54, so 6a\u00b2=54 \u21d2 a\u00b2=9 \u21d2 a=3. Then volume would be 27, but in our problem volume is 23. So that's inconsistent. Therefore, the cube is not part of set B. So the variables can't all be equal. \n\nTherefore, we need to consider unequal variables. Let me see if from the Lagrangian equations we can find relations between a,b,c.\n\nLooking at the first two equations:\n\n1 - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc =0,\n\n1 - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac =0,\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n[ -\u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc ] - [ -\u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac ] =0,\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-\u03bb(b + c - a - c) - \u03bc (bc - ac)=0,\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n-\u03bb(b - a) - \u03bc c (b -a)=0,\n\nFactor out (b -a):\n\n(b -a)(-\u03bb - \u03bc c)=0,\n\nTherefore, either b =a or -\u03bb - \u03bc c =0.\n\nSimilarly, comparing the first and third equations:\n\n1 - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc =0,\n\n1 - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc ab =0,\n\nSubtracting:\n\n-\u03bb(b + c - a - b) - \u03bc (bc -ab)=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n-\u03bb(c -a) - \u03bc b(c - a)=0,\n\nFactor out (c -a):\n\n(c -a)(-\u03bb - \u03bc b)=0,\n\nTherefore, either c =a or -\u03bb - \u03bc b =0.\n\nSimilarly, comparing equations pairwise, so if none of the variables are equal, then we must have:\n\nFrom first and second equations: -\u03bb - \u03bc c =0,\n\nFrom first and third equations: -\u03bb - \u03bc b =0,\n\nTherefore, equating these: -\u03bb - \u03bc c = -\u03bb - \u03bc b \u21d2 \u03bc c = \u03bc b \u21d2 since \u03bc can't be zero (else, from first equation, 1 - \u03bb(b + c)=0, but then similar terms would have to hold, leading to contradictions unless variables are equal?), so \u03bc \u22600, so c = b.\n\nSimilarly, from first and second equations, if variables aren't equal, then c must equal b. Similarly, from other equations, if variables aren't equal, then c must equal a, but that would require a = b = c, which is a contradiction unless all are equal, which they can't be. So perhaps this suggests that two variables are equal?\n\nWait, so let's suppose that two variables are equal. Let's suppose a = b. Then, from above, maybe that's a case we can consider. Earlier, when I set a = b, we found a solution at a = 2, c =23/4, so that gives a sum of 9.75. Let me check if that's the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another pair of variables equal?\n\nSuppose instead that a = c, then similar steps would follow. Let me see. Let me see if that gives a different result.\n\nSuppose a = c. Then the equations become:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ab =27,\n\nand a\u00b2 b =23.\n\nThen solving similarly:\n\nFrom the second equation, b =23/(a\u00b2). Substitute into first equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2a*(23/(a\u00b2)) =27,\n\nSame as before, leading to a\u00b3 -27a +46=0, so same equation. So same solution a=2, then b=23/(4). So same as before. So same sum.\n\nSimilarly, if b =c, same result. So in this case, the maximum sum when two variables are equal gives a + b + c = 39/4 =9.75. \n\nAlternatively, is there a case where variables are not equal that gives a higher sum?\n\nLet me see. Let me suppose that variables are not equal, and see if that's possible. Suppose that a, b, c are all different. Then from the Lagrangian conditions, we must have from the earlier deductions that -\u03bb - \u03bc c =0 and -\u03bb - \u03bc b =0, so that implies that c = b. Contradiction. So unless variables are equal in pairs, this can't hold. Therefore, the only critical points occur when two variables are equal. Therefore, the maximum must occur at a case where two variables are equal. Therefore, the case a =b gives the maximum. \n\nTherefore, the maximum a + b + c is 39/4, so then the space diagonal squared would be (a + b + c)^2 - 54 = (39/4)^2 -54. Wait, let me confirm that formula again. \n\nEarlier, we had a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac). Since ab + bc + ac =27, so that's (a + b + c)^2 - 54. \n\nSo substituting (39/4)^2 -54:\n\nFirst compute (39/4)^2: 39 squared is 1521, so 1521/16. \n\n54 is 54*16/16 = 864/16. \n\nThus, 1521/16 - 864/16 = (1521 - 864)/16 = 657/16. \n\nTherefore, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16). Therefore, the radius r is half of that, so sqrt(657/16)/2 = sqrt(657)/ (4). Therefore, r squared is (657)/(16*4) = 657/64. Wait, hold on. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, the space diagonal squared is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 657/16. Therefore, the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16). The radius is half of the space diagonal, so the radius squared would be ( (sqrt(657/16)) / 2 )^2 = (657/16)/4 = 657/(16*4) = 657/64. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm this step again. Let me see:\n\nIf space diagonal squared is D\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 657/16,\n\nthen the radius is D/2, so r = D/2,\n\nthus r squared is (D\u00b2)/4 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64.\n\nHmm, so 657/64. Let me check if that reduces. 657 divided by 3 is 219, so 657 = 3*219 = 3*3*73. 73 is a prime number. 64 is 2^6. So 657 and 64 share no common factors. Therefore, p =657, q=64, so p + q = 657 +64=721. \n\nWait, but hold on, before I get too confident, let me verify if the case where a = b =2 and c=23/4 indeed gives the maximum a + b + c. Because maybe there are other critical points when variables are not equal? But according to the Lagrangian analysis, the only critical points are when two variables are equal. Therefore, that should be the maximum. \n\nAlternatively, let me test another case where variables are not equal. Let me pick different values. Suppose that one variable is very small. Let me see if that can lead to a higher sum.\n\nSuppose that a approaches 0. Then, the volume abc =23 would require that bc approaches infinity, but surface area ab + bc + ac =27. If a approaches 0, then ab and ac terms go to zero, so bc must approach 27. But then volume would be a* bc \u2248 a*27 =23, so a\u224823/27\u22480.85. Wait, but that contradicts the assumption that a approaches zero. Hmm, so maybe the variables can't get too small. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me choose a different set of variables. Let me see if there are other real solutions.\n\nSuppose, for example, that a =1, then we have equations:\n\nFrom volume: 1*b*c =23 \u21d2 bc=23,\n\nFrom surface area: 1*b +1*c + b*c =27 \u21d2 b +c +23=27 \u21d2 b +c =4.\n\nSo we have b + c =4 and bc=23. Then, the quadratic equation would be x\u00b2 -4x +23=0. The discriminant is 16 -92 = -76 <0, so no real solutions. Therefore, a=1 is impossible.\n\nHow about a=3? Then, volume: 3*b*c=23 \u21d2 bc=23/3\u22487.6667,\n\nSurface area: 3b +3c + bc =27 \u21d2 3(b +c) + (23/3)=27 \u21d2 3(b +c)=27 -23/3\u224827-7.6667\u224819.3333 \u21d2 b +c\u22486.4444.\n\nSo, solving b +c=6.4444 and bc\u22487.6667. Let me compute discriminant:\n\nLet me write exact fractions. Let me do it precisely:\n\nIf a=3,\n\nSurface area equation:\n\n3b +3c + bc =27,\n\nVolume equation: bc =23/3,\n\nSubstitute bc into surface area equation:\n\n3(b +c) +23/3 =27,\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n9(b +c) +23 =81,\n\nThus, 9(b +c)=58 \u21d2 b +c=58/9 \u22486.4444.\n\nThus, the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 - (58/9)x +23/3=0,\n\nMultiply all terms by 9:\n\n9x\u00b2 -58x +69=0,\n\nDiscriminant: 58\u00b2 -4*9*69 =3364 - 2484= 880,\n\nWhich is positive, so real roots. So there are real solutions here. Let me compute b and c:\n\nx=(58 \u00b1 sqrt(880))/18,\n\nsqrt(880)=sqrt(16*55)=4*sqrt(55)\u22484*7.416\u224829.664,\n\nThus, roots\u2248 (58 \u00b129.664)/18,\n\nFirst root: (58+29.664)/18\u224887.664/18\u22484.87,\n\nSecond root: (58-29.664)/18\u224828.336/18\u22481.574.\n\nSo variables would be a=3, b\u22484.87, c\u22481.574. Then the sum a +b +c\u22483 +4.87 +1.574\u22489.444, which is less than 9.75. So the previous case with a=2 gives a higher sum. \n\nAnother test case: let me try a= sqrt(23), but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, let me see if when variables are unequal but not approaching zero, maybe gives a higher sum. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a=2.5, let me see.\n\nSuppose a=2.5, then volume:2.5*b*c=23 \u21d2 bc=23/2.5=9.2,\n\nSurface area:2.5b +2.5c + bc=27 \u21d22.5(b +c) +9.2=27 \u21d22.5(b +c)=17.8 \u21d2b +c=17.8/2.5\u22487.12,\n\nThen quadratic equation x\u00b2 -7.12x +9.2=0,\n\nDiscriminant: 7.12\u00b2 -4*9.2\u224850.7 -36.8\u224813.9,\n\nsqrt(13.9)\u22483.73,\n\nThus roots\u2248(7.12 \u00b13.73)/2,\n\nWhich gives \u2248(10.85)/2\u22485.425 and \u2248(3.39)/2\u22481.695,\n\nSo sum a +b +c\u22482.5 +5.425 +1.695\u22489.62, still less than 9.75.\n\nHmm, so that's still lower than the 9.75 from the a=b=2 case. Let me try another one where a=1.5.\n\na=1.5,\n\nVolume:1.5*b*c=23 \u21d2 bc=23/(1.5)=15.333...\n\nSurface area:1.5b +1.5c + bc=27,\n\nSo 1.5(b +c) +15.333...=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=11.666..., so b +c\u22487.777...\n\nThus quadratic equation x\u00b2 -7.777x +15.333=0,\n\nDiscriminant: (7.777)^2 -4*15.333\u224860.5 -61.333\u2248-0.833, which is negative. No solution. So that's impossible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps 9.75 is indeed the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, let's check with a=2. Let me compute the space diagonal squared in that case.\n\nIf a=b=2, c=23/4=5.75,\n\nThen a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=4 +4 + (5.75)^2=8 +33.0625=41.0625,\n\nWait, but according to the formula earlier, (a + b + c)^2 -54. Let's check:\n\na +b +c=2+2+5.75=9.75,\n\nSo (9.75)^2= (39/4)^2=1521/16\u224895.0625,\n\nMinus 54 (which is 864/16), so 1521/16 -864/16=657/16\u224841.0625. Which matches. So that is correct.\n\nBut in the case when a=3, the sum was about 9.44, so the space diagonal squared would be (9.44)^2 -54\u224889.11 -54\u224835.11, which is less than 41.06. So indeed, the case with a=2 gives a larger space diagonal.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the maximum space diagonal occurs when two edges are 2 and the third is 23/4. Therefore, the radius squared is 657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check if there is another case where variables are not equal but give a higher sum. Let me try with a=2. Let me see if that is the only critical point.\n\nAlternatively, when I solved the cubic equation earlier, the only real root was a=2. The other roots were complex? Wait, no, actually the cubic equation a\u00b3 -27a +46=0 had a real root at a=2 and the other roots from the quadratic: a\u00b2 +2a -23=0, which gives a=(-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92))/2=(-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96))/2= (-2 \u00b14*sqrt(6))/2= -1 \u00b12*sqrt(6). Since sqrt(6)\u22482.45, so 2*sqrt(6)\u22484.9, so the other roots are -1 +4.9\u22483.9 and -1 -4.9\u2248-5.9. The negative root is discarded, but the positive root is \u22483.9. Wait a second! Wait, I think I made a mistake here earlier.\n\nHold on, in the case when I set a = b, the cubic equation was a\u00b3 -27a +46=0, which factors as (a -2)(a\u00b2 +2a -23)=0, so the other roots are from a\u00b2 +2a -23=0, which are indeed a=(-2 \u00b1\u221a(4 +92))/2 = (-2 \u00b1\u221a96)/2. So the positive root is [ -2 + \u221a96 ] /2 \u2248 (-2 +9.798)/2\u22487.798/2\u22483.899. So approximately 3.9. So there's another real root at a\u22483.9. Wait, but earlier I thought that only a=2 was positive. But actually, that quadratic has two roots: one positive (\u22483.9) and one negative. So that's another solution. So when I set a = b, the cubic equation has two positive roots: a=2 and a\u22483.9. So perhaps I missed that?\n\nWait, so let me recast that. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf when we set a = b, then the cubic equation a\u00b3 -27a +46=0 has roots at a=2 and a\u22483.9. So there are two solutions. Therefore, I need to check both.\n\nFirst, when a=2, we have c=23/(2\u00b2)=23/4\u22485.75 as before.\n\nSecond, when a\u22483.9, let's compute c=23/(a\u00b2). Let me compute a precisely.\n\nThe positive root of a\u00b2 +2a -23=0 is a=(-2 + sqrt(4 +92))/2= (-2 + sqrt(96))/2.\n\nsqrt(96)= 9.798, so a=( -2 +9.798)/2\u22487.798/2\u22483.899. Let me compute exactly sqrt(96)=4*sqrt(6), so exact form is (-2 +4\u221a6)/2= -1 +2\u221a6\u2248-1 +4.899\u22483.899.\n\nThus, a\u22483.899. Then c=23/(a\u00b2). Let me compute a squared:\n\n( -1 +2\u221a6 )^2 =1 -4\u221a6 +24=25 -4\u221a6\u224825 -9.798\u224815.202,\n\nThus, c=23/(25 -4\u221a6). Let me rationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4\u221a6):\n\nc=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/[ (25)^2 - (4\u221a6)^2 ] =23*(25 +4\u221a6)/[625 - 16*6]=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/529.\n\nSimplify 23/529=1/23. So c=(25 +4\u221a6)/23\u2248(25 +9.798)/23\u224834.798/23\u22481.513.\n\nTherefore, when a\u22483.899, b=a\u22483.899, c\u22481.513, so the sum a +b +c\u22483.899 +3.899 +1.513\u22489.311, which is less than 9.75. So even though there is another solution, the sum is lower. Therefore, the maximum occurs at a=2, giving the higher sum. \n\nTherefore, the maximum a + b +c is 39/4=9.75, leading to space diagonal squared of 657/16, so radius squared is 657/(16*4)=657/64. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation again for that second case. \n\nWait, if a= (-1 + 2\u221a6), then:\n\na + b +c = 2a +c =2*(-1 +2\u221a6) + c. Since c=23/a\u00b2, which we computed as (25 +4\u221a6)/23. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the exact calculation. Let me check again:\n\nWait, when a = (-1 +2\u221a6), then a squared is:\n\na\u00b2 = ( -1 +2\u221a6 )\u00b2 =1 -4\u221a6 + (2\u221a6)^2 =1 -4\u221a6 + 24 =25 -4\u221a6,\n\nTherefore, c =23/(25 -4\u221a6). Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4\u221a6):\n\nc=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/[ (25)^2 - (4\u221a6)^2 ] =23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/529,\n\nSo 23/529=1/23, so c=(25 +4\u221a6)/23. Therefore, c\u2248(25 +9.798)/23\u224834.798/23\u22481.513.\n\nTherefore, a + b +c = 2a +c =2*(-1 +2\u221a6) + (25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nCompute this exactly:\n\nFirst, 2a =2*(-1 +2\u221a6)= -2 +4\u221a6,\n\nAdding c:\n\nTotal sum: (-2 +4\u221a6) + (25 +4\u221a6)/23,\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n= [ (-2*23 +4\u221a6*23) +25 +4\u221a6 ] /23,\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute numerically:\n\n-2 +4\u221a6 \u2248-2 +4*2.449\u2248-2 +9.796\u22487.796,\n\nAdding c\u22481.513 gives total\u22487.796 +1.513\u22489.309, which is indeed less than 9.75. \n\nTherefore, the maximum is indeed at a=2, so the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so r squared is 657/64. \n\nWait, but hold on, let me check if 657 and 64 are co-prime. 657 divided by 3 is 219, which divided by 3 is 73. So 657=3*3*73. 64 is 2^6. There are no common factors, so yes, 657/64 is reduced. Thus p=657, q=64, so p+q=721. \n\nBut wait, before finalizing, let me see if there's another approach where maybe the minimal sphere is not determined by the space diagonal? Wait, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So, for each box in B, the sphere must contain the box, so the sphere must contain all points of the box. The minimal sphere enclosing a box is indeed the sphere with diameter equal to the space diagonal, centered at the center of the box. So the radius is half the space diagonal. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B will determine the minimal radius needed to contain all boxes, since the sphere must be large enough for the largest diagonal. So yes, that approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 657 +64=721, so boxed 721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest sphere that can contain all rectangular boxes in set B, which have a surface area of 54 and volume of 23. Then, compute r squared and express it as a fraction p/q, finally finding p + q. Hmm, let me start breaking this down.\n\nFirst, the problem is about rectangular boxes with given surface area and volume. The sphere that can contain each of these boxes must have a radius at least as large as half the space diagonal of the box. Because the space diagonal is the longest distance between any two vertices of the box, so the sphere needs to have a diameter at least equal to that diagonal. Therefore, the minimal radius r would be half of the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in set B. So, the key is to find the maximum possible space diagonal of a box with surface area 54 and volume 23, then divide that by 2 and square it for r squared.\n\nWait, but actually, since we need the smallest sphere that can contain each of the boxes in B, the sphere must be able to contain all possible such boxes. So actually, the radius has to be at least as large as the maximum space diagonal divided by 2 over all boxes in B. Therefore, the minimal such r is the maximum of (space diagonal)/2 over all boxes in B. So we need to maximize the space diagonal given the constraints of surface area and volume. \n\nSo, the problem reduces to: given a rectangular box with surface area 54 and volume 23, find the maximum possible space diagonal. Then r is half of that, and r squared is (space diagonal squared)/4. So, first, I need to maximize the space diagonal of the box under the constraints of surface area and volume. \n\nLet me denote the edge lengths of the box as a, b, c. Then the surface area is 2(ab + bc + ac) = 54, so ab + bc + ac = 27. The volume is abc = 23. The space diagonal is sqrt(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2). Therefore, to maximize the space diagonal, we need to maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given the constraints ab + bc + ac =27 and abc =23.\n\nHmm, okay, so how do I maximize a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 given ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers? But perhaps there's a smarter way. Alternatively, since it's a problem with symmetric constraints, maybe we can express a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 in terms of (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac). Since (a + b + c)^2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 + 2(ab + bc + ac). Therefore, a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac). Since ab + bc + ac is given as 27, so that's (a + b + c)^2 - 54. Therefore, maximizing a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 is equivalent to maximizing (a + b + c)^2. Therefore, to maximize the space diagonal squared (and thus the space diagonal), we need to maximize a + b + c. So the problem reduces to maximizing a + b + c given that ab + bc + ac =27 and abc=23. \n\nHmm, so perhaps we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers here, but maybe there's a way to parameterize the variables. Let me think. Since we have three variables with two equations, we can perhaps express one variable in terms of the others and substitute. Alternatively, maybe using inequalities.\n\nAlternatively, since we have three variables with symmetric constraints, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Maybe, but I need to verify.\n\nLet me consider variables a, b, c with abc =23 and ab + bc + ac =27. Let me denote variables as x, y, z for simplicity. Let me suppose that two variables are equal. Let's suppose a = b. Then, we can set a = b, so the equations become:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac =27,\n\nand a\u00b2 c =23.\n\nLet me denote a as a variable, then c can be expressed from the second equation: c =23/(a\u00b2). Substitute into the first equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2a*(23/(a\u00b2)) =27,\n\nSimplify:\n\na\u00b2 + (46)/a =27.\n\nMultiply both sides by a:\n\na\u00b3 + 46 =27a,\n\nThus, a\u00b3 -27a +46=0.\n\nHmm, solving this cubic equation. Let me try possible rational roots. The possible roots are factors of 46 over 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nTesting a=2: 8 -54 +46 =0. 8 -54 is -46 +46=0. So a=2 is a root. Therefore, we can factor (a -2)(a\u00b2 + 2a -23)=0. The quadratic equation a\u00b2 + 2a -23 =0 has roots [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since lengths are positive, the other roots would be negative, so the only positive real root is a=2. \n\nTherefore, when a = b =2, then c=23/(2\u00b2)=23/4=5.75. Then, the sum a + b + c is 2 +2 +5.75=9.75=39/4. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider other possibilities where variables are not equal, perhaps the sum a + b + c can be larger?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when variables are unequal. Let me see. Let's suppose that variables are not equal, but maybe one variable is very small. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the maximum of a + b + c occurs when two variables are as large as possible and one is small? Hmm, but constrained by the product and the sum of products.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian. Let me denote the function to maximize as f(a,b,c) = a + b + c. The constraints are:\n\ng1(a,b,c) = ab + bc + ac -27 =0,\n\ng2(a,b,c) = abc -23 =0.\n\nSo, we need to maximize f with constraints g1=0 and g2=0.\n\nThe Lagrangian is L = a + b + c - \u03bb(ab + bc + ac -27) - \u03bc(abc -23).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\ndL/da = 1 - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc =0,\n\ndL/db =1 - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac =0,\n\ndL/dc =1 - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc ab =0,\n\nAlso, the constraints:\n\nab + bc + ac =27,\n\nabc=23.\n\nHmm, so the partial derivatives give three equations:\n\n1 - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc =0,\n\n1 - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac =0,\n\n1 - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc ab =0.\n\nHmm, let's see if we can find symmetry here. Suppose that a = b = c, but in that case, the volume would be a\u00b3 =23, so a = cube root of 23 \u22482.843, but then surface area would be 6a\u00b2 \u22486*(23^(2/3))\u2248?\n\nWait, let me compute surface area if a = b =c. Let me see:\n\nIf a = b =c, then 6a\u00b2 = surface area. But surface area is given as 54, so 6a\u00b2=54 \u21d2 a\u00b2=9 \u21d2 a=3. Then volume would be 27, but in our problem volume is 23. So that's inconsistent. Therefore, the cube is not part of set B. So the variables can't all be equal. \n\nTherefore, we need to consider unequal variables. Let me see if from the Lagrangian equations we can find relations between a,b,c.\n\nLooking at the first two equations:\n\n1 - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc =0,\n\n1 - \u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac =0,\n\nSubtract the second equation from the first:\n\n[ -\u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc ] - [ -\u03bb(a + c) - \u03bc ac ] =0,\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n-\u03bb(b + c - a - c) - \u03bc (bc - ac)=0,\n\nSimplify terms:\n\n-\u03bb(b - a) - \u03bc c (b -a)=0,\n\nFactor out (b -a):\n\n(b -a)(-\u03bb - \u03bc c)=0,\n\nTherefore, either b =a or -\u03bb - \u03bc c =0.\n\nSimilarly, comparing the first and third equations:\n\n1 - \u03bb(b + c) - \u03bc bc =0,\n\n1 - \u03bb(a + b) - \u03bc ab =0,\n\nSubtracting:\n\n-\u03bb(b + c - a - b) - \u03bc (bc -ab)=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n-\u03bb(c -a) - \u03bc b(c - a)=0,\n\nFactor out (c -a):\n\n(c -a)(-\u03bb - \u03bc b)=0,\n\nTherefore, either c =a or -\u03bb - \u03bc b =0.\n\nSimilarly, comparing equations pairwise, so if none of the variables are equal, then we must have:\n\nFrom first and second equations: -\u03bb - \u03bc c =0,\n\nFrom first and third equations: -\u03bb - \u03bc b =0,\n\nTherefore, equating these: -\u03bb - \u03bc c = -\u03bb - \u03bc b \u21d2 \u03bc c = \u03bc b \u21d2 since \u03bc can't be zero (else, from first equation, 1 - \u03bb(b + c)=0, but then similar terms would have to hold, leading to contradictions unless variables are equal?), so \u03bc \u22600, so c = b.\n\nSimilarly, from first and second equations, if variables aren't equal, then c must equal b. Similarly, from other equations, if variables aren't equal, then c must equal a, but that would require a = b = c, which is a contradiction unless all are equal, which they can't be. So perhaps this suggests that two variables are equal?\n\nWait, so let's suppose that two variables are equal. Let's suppose a = b. Then, from above, maybe that's a case we can consider. Earlier, when I set a = b, we found a solution at a = 2, c =23/4, so that gives a sum of 9.75. Let me check if that's the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe another pair of variables equal?\n\nSuppose instead that a = c, then similar steps would follow. Let me see. Let me see if that gives a different result.\n\nSuppose a = c. Then the equations become:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ab =27,\n\nand a\u00b2 b =23.\n\nThen solving similarly:\n\nFrom the second equation, b =23/(a\u00b2). Substitute into first equation:\n\na\u00b2 + 2a*(23/(a\u00b2)) =27,\n\nSame as before, leading to a\u00b3 -27a +46=0, so same equation. So same solution a=2, then b=23/(4). So same as before. So same sum.\n\nSimilarly, if b =c, same result. So in this case, the maximum sum when two variables are equal gives a + b + c = 39/4 =9.75. \n\nAlternatively, is there a case where variables are not equal that gives a higher sum?\n\nLet me see. Let me suppose that variables are not equal, and see if that's possible. Suppose that a, b, c are all different. Then from the Lagrangian conditions, we must have from the earlier deductions that -\u03bb - \u03bc c =0 and -\u03bb - \u03bc b =0, so that implies that c = b. Contradiction. So unless variables are equal in pairs, this can't hold. Therefore, the only critical points occur when two variables are equal. Therefore, the maximum must occur at a case where two variables are equal. Therefore, the case a =b gives the maximum. \n\nTherefore, the maximum a + b + c is 39/4, so then the space diagonal squared would be (a + b + c)^2 - 54 = (39/4)^2 -54. Wait, let me confirm that formula again. \n\nEarlier, we had a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac). Since ab + bc + ac =27, so that's (a + b + c)^2 - 54. \n\nSo substituting (39/4)^2 -54:\n\nFirst compute (39/4)^2: 39 squared is 1521, so 1521/16. \n\n54 is 54*16/16 = 864/16. \n\nThus, 1521/16 - 864/16 = (1521 - 864)/16 = 657/16. \n\nTherefore, the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16). Therefore, the radius r is half of that, so sqrt(657/16)/2 = sqrt(657)/ (4). Therefore, r squared is (657)/(16*4) = 657/64. Wait, hold on. Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, the space diagonal squared is a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 657/16. Therefore, the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16). The radius is half of the space diagonal, so the radius squared would be ( (sqrt(657/16)) / 2 )^2 = (657/16)/4 = 657/(16*4) = 657/64. \n\nBut wait, let me confirm this step again. Let me see:\n\nIf space diagonal squared is D\u00b2 = a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 657/16,\n\nthen the radius is D/2, so r = D/2,\n\nthus r squared is (D\u00b2)/4 = (657/16)/4 = 657/64.\n\nHmm, so 657/64. Let me check if that reduces. 657 divided by 3 is 219, so 657 = 3*219 = 3*3*73. 73 is a prime number. 64 is 2^6. So 657 and 64 share no common factors. Therefore, p =657, q=64, so p + q = 657 +64=721. \n\nWait, but hold on, before I get too confident, let me verify if the case where a = b =2 and c=23/4 indeed gives the maximum a + b + c. Because maybe there are other critical points when variables are not equal? But according to the Lagrangian analysis, the only critical points are when two variables are equal. Therefore, that should be the maximum. \n\nAlternatively, let me test another case where variables are not equal. Let me pick different values. Suppose that one variable is very small. Let me see if that can lead to a higher sum.\n\nSuppose that a approaches 0. Then, the volume abc =23 would require that bc approaches infinity, but surface area ab + bc + ac =27. If a approaches 0, then ab and ac terms go to zero, so bc must approach 27. But then volume would be a* bc \u2248 a*27 =23, so a\u224823/27\u22480.85. Wait, but that contradicts the assumption that a approaches zero. Hmm, so maybe the variables can't get too small. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me choose a different set of variables. Let me see if there are other real solutions.\n\nSuppose, for example, that a =1, then we have equations:\n\nFrom volume: 1*b*c =23 \u21d2 bc=23,\n\nFrom surface area: 1*b +1*c + b*c =27 \u21d2 b +c +23=27 \u21d2 b +c =4.\n\nSo we have b + c =4 and bc=23. Then, the quadratic equation would be x\u00b2 -4x +23=0. The discriminant is 16 -92 = -76 <0, so no real solutions. Therefore, a=1 is impossible.\n\nHow about a=3? Then, volume: 3*b*c=23 \u21d2 bc=23/3\u22487.6667,\n\nSurface area: 3b +3c + bc =27 \u21d2 3(b +c) + (23/3)=27 \u21d2 3(b +c)=27 -23/3\u224827-7.6667\u224819.3333 \u21d2 b +c\u22486.4444.\n\nSo, solving b +c=6.4444 and bc\u22487.6667. Let me compute discriminant:\n\nLet me write exact fractions. Let me do it precisely:\n\nIf a=3,\n\nSurface area equation:\n\n3b +3c + bc =27,\n\nVolume equation: bc =23/3,\n\nSubstitute bc into surface area equation:\n\n3(b +c) +23/3 =27,\n\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\n9(b +c) +23 =81,\n\nThus, 9(b +c)=58 \u21d2 b +c=58/9 \u22486.4444.\n\nThus, the quadratic equation is x\u00b2 - (58/9)x +23/3=0,\n\nMultiply all terms by 9:\n\n9x\u00b2 -58x +69=0,\n\nDiscriminant: 58\u00b2 -4*9*69 =3364 - 2484= 880,\n\nWhich is positive, so real roots. So there are real solutions here. Let me compute b and c:\n\nx=(58 \u00b1 sqrt(880))/18,\n\nsqrt(880)=sqrt(16*55)=4*sqrt(55)\u22484*7.416\u224829.664,\n\nThus, roots\u2248 (58 \u00b129.664)/18,\n\nFirst root: (58+29.664)/18\u224887.664/18\u22484.87,\n\nSecond root: (58-29.664)/18\u224828.336/18\u22481.574.\n\nSo variables would be a=3, b\u22484.87, c\u22481.574. Then the sum a +b +c\u22483 +4.87 +1.574\u22489.444, which is less than 9.75. So the previous case with a=2 gives a higher sum. \n\nAnother test case: let me try a= sqrt(23), but that might not be helpful. Alternatively, let me see if when variables are unequal but not approaching zero, maybe gives a higher sum. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a=2.5, let me see.\n\nSuppose a=2.5, then volume:2.5*b*c=23 \u21d2 bc=23/2.5=9.2,\n\nSurface area:2.5b +2.5c + bc=27 \u21d22.5(b +c) +9.2=27 \u21d22.5(b +c)=17.8 \u21d2b +c=17.8/2.5\u22487.12,\n\nThen quadratic equation x\u00b2 -7.12x +9.2=0,\n\nDiscriminant: 7.12\u00b2 -4*9.2\u224850.7 -36.8\u224813.9,\n\nsqrt(13.9)\u22483.73,\n\nThus roots\u2248(7.12 \u00b13.73)/2,\n\nWhich gives \u2248(10.85)/2\u22485.425 and \u2248(3.39)/2\u22481.695,\n\nSo sum a +b +c\u22482.5 +5.425 +1.695\u22489.62, still less than 9.75.\n\nHmm, so that's still lower than the 9.75 from the a=b=2 case. Let me try another one where a=1.5.\n\na=1.5,\n\nVolume:1.5*b*c=23 \u21d2 bc=23/(1.5)=15.333...\n\nSurface area:1.5b +1.5c + bc=27,\n\nSo 1.5(b +c) +15.333...=27 \u21d21.5(b +c)=11.666..., so b +c\u22487.777...\n\nThus quadratic equation x\u00b2 -7.777x +15.333=0,\n\nDiscriminant: (7.777)^2 -4*15.333\u224860.5 -61.333\u2248-0.833, which is negative. No solution. So that's impossible.\n\nHmm, so perhaps 9.75 is indeed the maximum.\n\nAlternatively, let's check with a=2. Let me compute the space diagonal squared in that case.\n\nIf a=b=2, c=23/4=5.75,\n\nThen a\u00b2 +b\u00b2 +c\u00b2=4 +4 + (5.75)^2=8 +33.0625=41.0625,\n\nWait, but according to the formula earlier, (a + b + c)^2 -54. Let's check:\n\na +b +c=2+2+5.75=9.75,\n\nSo (9.75)^2= (39/4)^2=1521/16\u224895.0625,\n\nMinus 54 (which is 864/16), so 1521/16 -864/16=657/16\u224841.0625. Which matches. So that is correct.\n\nBut in the case when a=3, the sum was about 9.44, so the space diagonal squared would be (9.44)^2 -54\u224889.11 -54\u224835.11, which is less than 41.06. So indeed, the case with a=2 gives a larger space diagonal.\n\nTherefore, it seems that the maximum space diagonal occurs when two edges are 2 and the third is 23/4. Therefore, the radius squared is 657/64, so p+q=657+64=721.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check if there is another case where variables are not equal but give a higher sum. Let me try with a=2. Let me see if that is the only critical point.\n\nAlternatively, when I solved the cubic equation earlier, the only real root was a=2. The other roots were complex? Wait, no, actually the cubic equation a\u00b3 -27a +46=0 had a real root at a=2 and the other roots from the quadratic: a\u00b2 +2a -23=0, which gives a=(-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92))/2=(-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96))/2= (-2 \u00b14*sqrt(6))/2= -1 \u00b12*sqrt(6). Since sqrt(6)\u22482.45, so 2*sqrt(6)\u22484.9, so the other roots are -1 +4.9\u22483.9 and -1 -4.9\u2248-5.9. The negative root is discarded, but the positive root is \u22483.9. Wait a second! Wait, I think I made a mistake here earlier.\n\nHold on, in the case when I set a = b, the cubic equation was a\u00b3 -27a +46=0, which factors as (a -2)(a\u00b2 +2a -23)=0, so the other roots are from a\u00b2 +2a -23=0, which are indeed a=(-2 \u00b1\u221a(4 +92))/2 = (-2 \u00b1\u221a96)/2. So the positive root is [ -2 + \u221a96 ] /2 \u2248 (-2 +9.798)/2\u22487.798/2\u22483.899. So approximately 3.9. So there's another real root at a\u22483.9. Wait, but earlier I thought that only a=2 was positive. But actually, that quadratic has two roots: one positive (\u22483.9) and one negative. So that's another solution. So when I set a = b, the cubic equation has two positive roots: a=2 and a\u22483.9. So perhaps I missed that?\n\nWait, so let me recast that. Let me recalculate.\n\nIf when we set a = b, then the cubic equation a\u00b3 -27a +46=0 has roots at a=2 and a\u22483.9. So there are two solutions. Therefore, I need to check both.\n\nFirst, when a=2, we have c=23/(2\u00b2)=23/4\u22485.75 as before.\n\nSecond, when a\u22483.9, let's compute c=23/(a\u00b2). Let me compute a precisely.\n\nThe positive root of a\u00b2 +2a -23=0 is a=(-2 + sqrt(4 +92))/2= (-2 + sqrt(96))/2.\n\nsqrt(96)= 9.798, so a=( -2 +9.798)/2\u22487.798/2\u22483.899. Let me compute exactly sqrt(96)=4*sqrt(6), so exact form is (-2 +4\u221a6)/2= -1 +2\u221a6\u2248-1 +4.899\u22483.899.\n\nThus, a\u22483.899. Then c=23/(a\u00b2). Let me compute a squared:\n\n( -1 +2\u221a6 )^2 =1 -4\u221a6 +24=25 -4\u221a6\u224825 -9.798\u224815.202,\n\nThus, c=23/(25 -4\u221a6). Let me rationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4\u221a6):\n\nc=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/[ (25)^2 - (4\u221a6)^2 ] =23*(25 +4\u221a6)/[625 - 16*6]=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/529.\n\nSimplify 23/529=1/23. So c=(25 +4\u221a6)/23\u2248(25 +9.798)/23\u224834.798/23\u22481.513.\n\nTherefore, when a\u22483.899, b=a\u22483.899, c\u22481.513, so the sum a +b +c\u22483.899 +3.899 +1.513\u22489.311, which is less than 9.75. So even though there is another solution, the sum is lower. Therefore, the maximum occurs at a=2, giving the higher sum. \n\nTherefore, the maximum a + b +c is 39/4=9.75, leading to space diagonal squared of 657/16, so radius squared is 657/(16*4)=657/64. \n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculation again for that second case. \n\nWait, if a= (-1 + 2\u221a6), then:\n\na + b +c = 2a +c =2*(-1 +2\u221a6) + c. Since c=23/a\u00b2, which we computed as (25 +4\u221a6)/23. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the exact calculation. Let me check again:\n\nWait, when a = (-1 +2\u221a6), then a squared is:\n\na\u00b2 = ( -1 +2\u221a6 )\u00b2 =1 -4\u221a6 + (2\u221a6)^2 =1 -4\u221a6 + 24 =25 -4\u221a6,\n\nTherefore, c =23/(25 -4\u221a6). Multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4\u221a6):\n\nc=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/[ (25)^2 - (4\u221a6)^2 ] =23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 - 16*6)=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 -96)=23*(25 +4\u221a6)/529,\n\nSo 23/529=1/23, so c=(25 +4\u221a6)/23. Therefore, c\u2248(25 +9.798)/23\u224834.798/23\u22481.513.\n\nTherefore, a + b +c = 2a +c =2*(-1 +2\u221a6) + (25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nCompute this exactly:\n\nFirst, 2a =2*(-1 +2\u221a6)= -2 +4\u221a6,\n\nAdding c:\n\nTotal sum: (-2 +4\u221a6) + (25 +4\u221a6)/23,\n\nConvert to common denominator:\n\n= [ (-2*23 +4\u221a6*23) +25 +4\u221a6 ] /23,\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute numerically:\n\n-2 +4\u221a6 \u2248-2 +4*2.449\u2248-2 +9.796\u22487.796,\n\nAdding c\u22481.513 gives total\u22487.796 +1.513\u22489.309, which is indeed less than 9.75. \n\nTherefore, the maximum is indeed at a=2, so the space diagonal squared is 657/16, so r squared is 657/64. \n\nWait, but hold on, let me check if 657 and 64 are co-prime. 657 divided by 3 is 219, which divided by 3 is 73. So 657=3*3*73. 64 is 2^6. There are no common factors, so yes, 657/64 is reduced. Thus p=657, q=64, so p+q=721. \n\nBut wait, before finalizing, let me see if there's another approach where maybe the minimal sphere is not determined by the space diagonal? Wait, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So, for each box in B, the sphere must contain the box, so the sphere must contain all points of the box. The minimal sphere enclosing a box is indeed the sphere with diameter equal to the space diagonal, centered at the center of the box. So the radius is half the space diagonal. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B will determine the minimal radius needed to contain all boxes, since the sphere must be large enough for the largest diagonal. So yes, that approach is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 657 +64=721, so boxed 721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n\n\nGiven a set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius \\(r\\) of this sphere is half the maximum space diagonal of any box in \\(\\mathcal{B}\\). We aim to find \\(r^2\\) and express it as \\(\\frac{p}{q}\\), then compute \\(p + q\\).\n\nFirst, denote the edge lengths of the box as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\). The constraints are:\n\\[\nab + bc + ac = 27 \\quad \\text{(surface area)}\n\\]\n\\[\nabc = 23 \\quad \\text{(volume)}\n\\]\n\nThe space diagonal of the box is \\(\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}\\). To maximize this, we need to maximize \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\). Using the identity:\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 2(ab + bc + ac)\n\\]\nwe substitute \\(ab + bc + ac = 27\\) to get:\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (a + b + c)^2 - 54\n\\]\n\nThus, maximizing \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\) is equivalent to maximizing \\(a + b + c\\). We consider the case where two variables are equal, say \\(a = b\\). This leads to the equations:\n\\[\na^2 + 2ac = 27 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad a^2c = 23\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\(c\\) from the second equation gives \\(c = \\frac{23}{a^2}\\). Substituting into the first equation:\n\\[\na^2 + 2a \\left(\\frac{23}{a^2}\\right) = 27 \\implies a^3 - 27a + 46 = 0\n\\]\n\nThis cubic equation has a root \\(a = 2\\). Thus, \\(a = b = 2\\) and \\(c = \\frac{23}{4}\\). The sum \\(a + b + c\\) is:\n\\[\n2 + 2 + \\frac{23}{4} = \\frac{39}{4}\n\\]\n\nCalculating \\(a^2 + b^2 + c^2\\):\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{39}{4}\\right)^2 - 54 = \\frac{1521}{16} - \\frac{864}{16} = \\frac{657}{16}\n\\]\n\nThe space diagonal squared is \\(\\frac{657}{16}\\), so the radius \\(r\\) is half the space diagonal:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{657}{16}}}{2} \\implies r^2 = \\frac{657}{64}\n\\]\n\nSince 657 and 64 are coprime, \\(p = 657\\) and \\(q = 64\\). Therefore, \\(p + q = 657 + 64 = 721\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{721}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain all these boxes, and then express that as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p+q. Hmm, let's see. I need to start by understanding what exactly the problem is asking for.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a rectangular box is defined by its length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. The problem is asking for the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius of such a sphere would be half of the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere has to contain the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the minimal radius would be the minimal possible space diagonal divided by 2. Wait, but actually, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So actually, the sphere has to contain all possible boxes in set B. Therefore, the radius must be at least as large as the maximum space diagonal of any box in B divided by 2. Because if there's a box with a larger space diagonal, then the sphere must accommodate that. So essentially, we need to find the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, then divide by 2, square that, and get the value of r^2.\n\nTherefore, the key is to maximize the space diagonal of the rectangular boxes given the constraints of surface area 54 and volume 23.\n\nThe space diagonal of a box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). So we need to maximize sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2), given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23. Since sqrt is a monotonic function, maximizing the space diagonal is equivalent to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2. Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 under the given constraints.\n\nSo, let me note down the problem:\n\nMaximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 subject to:\n\n1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \u21d2 xy + yz + xz = 27,\n\n2. xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, okay. So how do I approach this? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers? Since it's a constrained optimization problem. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express variables in terms of each other. Let me consider variables x, y, z. Since we have symmetric equations, maybe assuming some symmetry in variables could help? But since the problem is to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, which is symmetric, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Or maybe when all variables are equal? Wait, but if all variables are equal, then it would be a cube. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nSuppose the box is a cube. Then x = y = z. Then surface area would be 6x\u00b2 = 54 \u21d2 x\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2 x = 3. Then the volume would be 27, but the given volume is 23. So that's not possible. So the box cannot be a cube. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal must be achieved by a non-cube box.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two sides are equal. Let me suppose that two variables are equal, say y = z. Then, let me set variables as x, y, y. Then the surface area becomes 2(xy + yx + y\u00b2) = 2(2xy + y\u00b2) = 4xy + 2y\u00b2 = 54 \u21d2 2xy + y\u00b2 = 27. The volume is x y\u00b2 = 23. Then, perhaps I can express x in terms of y from the volume equation and substitute into the surface area equation.\n\nSo, from the volume equation: x = 23/(y\u00b2). Then substitute into the surface area equation:\n\n2*(23/(y\u00b2))*y + y\u00b2 = 27 \u21d2 (46/y) + y\u00b2 = 27 \u21d2 y\u00b2 + 46/y = 27. Hmm, this is a bit messy. Let me rearrange it:\n\nMultiply both sides by y: y\u00b3 + 46 = 27y \u21d2 y\u00b3 - 27y + 46 = 0. Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Maybe I can try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nTesting y = 1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 \u22600\n\ny = 2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Oh! y=2 is a root. So, we can factor it as (y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = 0. Let me check:\n\n(y -2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = y\u00b3 +2y\u00b2 -23y -2y\u00b2 -4y +46 = y\u00b3 -27y +46. Yes, that's correct. So the roots are y=2 and roots of y\u00b2 +2y -23=0. The other roots would be y = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)] /2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since y must be positive, only y = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.899 \u2248 3.899 is positive, but the other one is negative, so discard. So the real positive roots are y=2 and y\u22483.899.\n\nSo, when y=2, then x = 23/(y\u00b2) = 23/4 = 5.75. So then x = 23/(2)^2 = 23/4, y = z =2. So the dimensions would be (23/4, 2, 2). Let me check the surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 2( (23/4 *2) + (2*2) + (23/4 *2) ) = 2( (23/2) +4 + (23/2) ) = 2(23/2 +23/2 +4) = 2(23 +4) = 2*27=54, which is correct. The volume is (23/4)*2*2 =23, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if y = -1 +2\u221a6, then let's see. Let me compute y \u2248 -1 +4.899\u22483.899. Then x =23/(y\u00b2). Let me compute that numerically. Let me see if that gives another solution. Let me check if that works. But perhaps the maximum x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 occurs at one of these points? Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's compute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 for the case when y = z =2, x=23/4. Then:\n\nx\u00b2 = (23/4)^2 = 529/16 \u224833.0625,\n\ny\u00b2 = 4,\n\nz\u00b2 =4,\n\nTotal: 529/16 + 8 = (529 + 128)/16 = 657/16 \u224841.0625.\n\nAlternatively, if y is the other root, let's see. Let me take y = -1 +2\u221a6. Let me compute that exactly. Let me denote y = -1 +2\u221a6. Then y\u00b2 = ( -1 +2\u221a6 )\u00b2 =1 -4\u221a6 +24 =25 -4\u221a6. Then x =23/y\u00b2 =23/(25 -4\u221a6). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4\u221a6):\n\nx =23*(25 +4\u221a6)/[(25)^2 - (4\u221a6)^2] =23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 - 96) =23*(25 +4\u221a6)/529.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 23 and 529 (which is 23\u00b2). So, x = (25 +4\u221a6)/23. Therefore, x is (25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nThen, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2 (since z=y). Let's compute that:\n\nFirst compute x\u00b2:\n\n[(25 +4\u221a6)/23]^2 = (25\u00b2 + 2*25*4\u221a6 + (4\u221a6)^2)/23\u00b2\n\n= (625 + 200\u221a6 + 16*6)/529\n\n= (625 + 200\u221a6 + 96)/529\n\n= (721 + 200\u221a6)/529\n\nThen 2y\u00b2 =2*(25 -4\u221a6) =50 -8\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, total x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (721 +200\u221a6)/529 +50 -8\u221a6.\n\nConvert 50 to 50*(529/529) and -8\u221a6 to (-8\u221a6)*(529/529):\n\nWait, actually, to add fractions, we need a common denominator. Let me write everything over 529:\n\n= [721 + 200\u221a6 + 50*529 -8\u221a6*529]/529\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, let me compute numerically:\n\nFirst, compute x \u2248 (25 +4*2.449)/23 \u2248 (25 +9.796)/23 \u224834.796/23\u22481.513.\n\nThen x\u00b2 \u2248 (1.513)^2\u22482.289.\n\ny\u22483.899, so y\u00b2\u224815.204, so 2y\u00b2\u224830.408.\n\nTotal x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u22482.289 +30.408\u224832.697.\n\nWait, that's way less than the previous case where it was approximately 41.06. So the maximum seems to occur at y=2, giving a larger space diagonal. Hmm, so that suggests that when y=z=2, x=23/4\u22485.75, the sum x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is higher. So perhaps that is the maximum?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a case where all variables are different, which could give a higher sum? Because maybe assuming two variables equal is restrictive? Hmm. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can approach this problem using Lagrange multipliers. Let me set up the Lagrangian.\n\nLet me denote the function to maximize as f(x,y,z) =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2,\n\nsubject to the constraints:\n\ng(x,y,z)=xy + yz + xz =27,\n\nh(x,y,z)=xyz=23.\n\nWe need to use two constraints, so the Lagrangian would be:\n\nL = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - \u03bb(xy + yz + xz -27) - \u03bc(xyz -23).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 2x - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc(yz) =0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202y =2y - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc(xz)=0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202z =2z - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc(xy)=0,\n\nAnd the constraints:\n\nxy + yz + xz =27,\n\nxyz=23.\n\nHmm, this system looks a bit complicated. Maybe there's symmetry here. Suppose two variables are equal, say y = z. Then, perhaps this is the case that gives the maximum. Let's check if the solution we found earlier satisfies the Lagrangian conditions.\n\nSuppose y = z. Let me denote variables as x, y, y. Then, the Lagrangian equations would be:\n\nFor x:\n\n2x - \u03bb( y + y ) - \u03bc(y*y) = 0 \u21d2 2x - 2\u03bb y - \u03bc y\u00b2 =0,\n\nFor y:\n\n2y - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc(x y )=0,\n\nSame for the other y (since z=y), so that's the same equation as above.\n\nSo, the equations become:\n\n1) 2x - 2\u03bb y - \u03bc y\u00b2 =0,\n\n2) 2y - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y =0,\n\nAdditionally, the constraints:\n\nxy + y\u00b2 + x y =27 \u21d2 2xy + y\u00b2=27,\n\nand x y\u00b2 =23.\n\nSo, let me see if with the solution x=23/(y\u00b2), y=2, which gives x=23/4, y=2, then:\n\nLet me compute the Lagrangian equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\n2*(23/4) -2\u03bb*2 - \u03bc*(2)^2 =0 \u21d2 (23/2) -4\u03bb -4\u03bc =0,\n\nSecond equation:\n\n2*2 - \u03bb( (23/4) +2 ) - \u03bc*(23/4)*2 =0 \u21d24 - \u03bb*(31/4) - \u03bc*(23/2)=0.\n\nSo now we can set up equations for \u03bb and \u03bc.\n\nLet me denote equation 1: 23/2 -4\u03bb -4\u03bc =0,\n\nequation 2:4 - (31/4)\u03bb - (23/2)\u03bc =0.\n\nLet me solve these equations. Let me denote equation 1 as:\n\n4\u03bb +4\u03bc =23/2,\n\ndivide both sides by 4:\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc =23/8.\n\nEquation 2:\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n16 -31\u03bb -46\u03bc =0,\n\nso,\n\n-31\u03bb -46\u03bc = -16 \u21d231\u03bb +46\u03bc =16.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nFrom equation 1: \u03bb =23/8 - \u03bc.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n31*(23/8 - \u03bc) +46\u03bc =16,\n\nCompute 31*(23/8) = (31*23)/8 =713/8,\n\nSo:\n\n713/8 -31\u03bc +46\u03bc =16,\n\nCombine terms:\n\n713/8 +15\u03bc =16,\n\nThen,\n\n15\u03bc =16 -713/8 = (128/8 -713/8)= (-585)/8,\n\nThus \u03bc = (-585)/(8*15) = -585/120 = -39/8.\n\nThen, \u03bb =23/8 - (-39/8)= (23 +39)/8=62/8=31/4.\n\nSo, \u03bb=31/4 and \u03bc= -39/8. Since these are real numbers, the solution satisfies the Lagrangian conditions, so that critical point is valid. So that is a local maximum or minimum?\n\nHmm, but since we are looking for the maximum of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, we need to check whether this is indeed the maximum. Since when we considered the other root, the value was lower, perhaps this is the maximum. However, to be thorough, maybe there's another critical point when variables are all different. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is the only critical point, so this would be the maximum. Alternatively, maybe there are other critical points. But given that when variables are all different, it's hard to compute, but since the symmetric case gives a higher value, maybe that is indeed the maximum. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another approach. Let me recall that for given surface area and volume, the space diagonal is maximized when the box is as \"stretched out\" as possible. Since when variables are unequal, the diagonal can be larger. Wait, but in the case of the cube, the diagonal is sqrt(3)x. Here, since the volume is less than the cube's volume (23 vs 27), perhaps making one side longer and others shorter can increase the diagonal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two sides are as small as possible? Hmm, not sure. Let me think of another method.\n\nAlternatively, using the method of substitution. Let me see if I can express x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 in terms of the given constraints.\n\nWe know that (x + y + z)^2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + 2(xy + yz +xz).\n\nWe have that xy + yz +xz =27, so,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2*27 = (x + y + z)^2 -54.\n\nTherefore, to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, we need to maximize (x + y + z)^2, which in turn requires maximizing x + y + z.\n\nTherefore, maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is equivalent to maximizing x + y + z. So perhaps we can instead try to maximize x + y + z given the constraints?\n\nHmm, that might be simpler. Let me see.\n\nSo, problem reduces to maximizing x + y + z, given that xy + yz + xz =27 and xyz=23.\n\nHmm, perhaps using AM \u2265 GM or other inequalities? But with these constraints, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider variables as roots of a cubic equation. Let me think.\n\nSuppose x, y, z are positive real numbers. Let me consider them as roots of the cubic equation t^3 - pt\u00b2 + qt - r =0, where p =x + y + z, q =xy + yz +xz =27, and r =xyz=23. So the cubic equation is t\u00b3 - p t\u00b2 +27 t -23=0.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible p. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible p where such real positive roots exist. Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but for maximizing p =x + y + z with the given constraints. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian for maximizing p =x + y + z,\n\nsubject to:\n\ng(x,y,z)=xy + yz +xz -27 =0,\n\nh(x,y,z)=xyz -23 =0.\n\nThen, the Lagrangian is:\n\nL =x + y + z - \u03bb(xy + yz +xz -27) - \u03bc(xyz -23).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x =1 - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc(y z)=0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202y =1 - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc(x z)=0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202z =1 - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc(x y)=0,\n\nConstraints:\n\nxy + yz +xz =27,\n\nxyz=23.\n\nHmm, this is similar to the previous Lagrangian but with a different objective function. However, perhaps the critical points are the same? Let me see.\n\nSuppose again that two variables are equal, say y = z. Let me see if the solution we found earlier also satisfies these equations.\n\nLet me take x=23/(y\u00b2), y = z=2. Then, let's check the Lagrangian equations here.\n\nFirst, compute the partial derivatives equations:\n\nFor x:\n\n1 - \u03bb( y + z ) - \u03bc(y z)=0,\n\nSince y = z =2,\n\n1 - \u03bb(4) - \u03bc(4)=0 \u21d21 -4\u03bb -4\u03bc =0,\n\nFor y:\n\n1 - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc(x z)=0,\n\nHere x=23/4, z=2,\n\n1 - \u03bb(23/4 +2 ) - \u03bc( (23/4)*2 )=0 \u21d21 - \u03bb*(31/4) - \u03bc*(23/2)=0,\n\nSame as before. So the equations are same as before. So if we set up the same Lagrangian equations, then the solution would be same. So, in this case, the maximum of x+y+z is achieved at that point?\n\nWait, but in this case, we are trying to maximize x+y+z, so perhaps that's the case. Let me see, if I proceed with this, then perhaps the maximum p is x+y+z = (23/4) +2 +2 = (23/4 +4)= 39/4 \u22489.75.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the other solution with y\u22483.899, then x\u22481.513, so x + y + z\u22481.513+3.899+3.899\u22489.311, which is less than 9.75. So that would mean that the maximum p is indeed 39/4, so the maximum x + y + z is 39/4, so the maximum x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is (39/4)^2 -54.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(39/4)^2 = (1521)/16,\n\n1521 divided by 16 is 95.0625,\n\n95.0625 -54 =41.0625, which matches the previous value of 657/16 (since 657 divided by 16 is 41.0625). Therefore, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, that critical point is indeed the maximum. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4. Therefore, the radius would be half of that, so sqrt(657)/8, so radius squared is (657)/(64). Wait, hold on:\n\nWait, the space diagonal squared is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 657/16. Therefore, the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16). The radius of the sphere must be at least half of that, so radius r = (1/2)*sqrt(657/16) = sqrt(657)/ (8). Therefore, r squared is (657)/(64). Therefore, the answer would be 657 + 64? Wait, 657 and 64. Are they coprime? Let me check.\n\nFirst, check if 657 and 64 have any common factors. 64 is 2^6. 657 divided by 2 is 328.5, so not divisible by 2. 6+5+7=18, so 657 is divisible by 3 (since 18 is divisible by 3). 657 divided by 3 is 219, then 219 divided by 3 is 73. So 657 = 3*3*73. 73 is a prime number. 64 is 2^6, so no common factors. Therefore, 657/64 is reduced, so p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721. Therefore, the answer is 721.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nFirst, the space diagonal squared is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =657/16. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half the space diagonal, so radius squared is ( (sqrt(657/16)) /2 )\u00b2 = (657/16)/4 =657/64. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, 657 and 64 are coprime since 657 factors into 3\u00b2\u00d773 and 64 is 2\u2076. No common factors. So p+q is indeed 657+64=721. Hmm, but before I get too confident, let me check if there could be another configuration where the space diagonal is larger.\n\nSuppose instead of setting two variables equal, there is a different configuration where all three variables are different, leading to a larger space diagonal. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers for the original problem (maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Let's see if when variables are not equal, there's a solution.\n\nLet me assume variables are all different. Let me see the Lagrangian equations again:\n\nFor the original problem of maximizing f =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2,\n\nthe Lagrangian equations were:\n\n2x - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z =0,\n\n2y - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z =0,\n\n2z - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y =0,\n\nwith constraints:\n\nxy + yz +xz =27,\n\nxyz=23.\n\nSuppose variables are not equal. Let me see if there's a solution where variables are not equal. Let me try to subtract equations to find relations between variables.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n[2y - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z] - [2x - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z] =0,\n\n2y -2x -\u03bb(x + z - y - z) - \u03bc(x z - y z)=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(y -x) -\u03bb(x - y) - \u03bc z(x - y)=0,\n\nFactor (y -x):\n\n(y -x)(-2 + \u03bb + \u03bc z)=0.\n\nSimilarly, since variables are different, y \u2260x, so:\n\n-2 + \u03bb + \u03bc z =0 \u21d2 \u03bb + \u03bc z =2.\n\nSimilarly, subtract the second and third equations:\n\n[2z - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y] - [2y - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z] =0,\n\n2z -2y -\u03bb(x + y -x - z) - \u03bc(x y -x z)=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(z - y) -\u03bb(y - z) -\u03bc x(y - z)=0,\n\nFactor (z - y):\n\n(z - y)(-2 + \u03bb + \u03bc x)=0,\n\nSince z \u2260 y (assuming all variables different), then:\n\n-2 + \u03bb + \u03bc x =0 \u21d2 \u03bb + \u03bc x=2.\n\nSimilarly, from first subtraction, we had \u03bb + \u03bc z =2,\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc z =2,\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc x =2,\n\nTherefore, subtract these two equations:\n\n\u03bc(z -x)=0.\n\nSince \u03bc \u22600 (otherwise from original equations, we would have 2x = \u03bb(y+z), etc., but if \u03bc=0, then equations become 2x = \u03bb(y+z), 2y=\u03bb(x+z), 2z=\u03bb(x+y). Then solving those, but perhaps leading to a cube which isn't our case. Since we have volume 23\u226027, so \u03bc can't be zero.\n\nTherefore, since \u03bc \u22600, then z -x=0 \u21d2 z =x. But that contradicts the assumption that all variables are different. Therefore, this suggests that variables cannot all be different. So either two variables are equal or all three are equal. Since all three equal is impossible (as that gives volume 27\u226023), so only two variables can be equal. Hence the maximum occurs when two variables are equal. Therefore, the solution we found earlier is indeed the maximum. Therefore, the answer is 657/64, so 657+64=721.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there is another case where two different variables are equal. For example, maybe x = z, but not y. But due to symmetry, it would result in the same maximum. For instance, if x = z, then the same equations would result in the same maximum value. Therefore, the maximum is unique up to permutation of variables.\n\nTherefore, I think that the answer is indeed 721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here about rectangular boxes with a surface area of 54 and a volume of 23. I need to find the radius squared of the smallest sphere that can contain all these boxes, and then express that as a fraction p/q where p and q are coprime, and finally find p+q. Hmm, let's see. I need to start by understanding what exactly the problem is asking for.\n\nFirst, let me recall that a rectangular box is defined by its length, width, and height. Let's denote them as x, y, z. The surface area of a rectangular box is 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54, and the volume is xyz = 23. The problem is asking for the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius of such a sphere would be half of the space diagonal of the box, right? Because the sphere has to contain the entire box, so the diameter of the sphere must be at least the space diagonal of the box. Therefore, the minimal radius would be the minimal possible space diagonal divided by 2. Wait, but actually, the problem says \"the smallest sphere that can contain each of the rectangular boxes that are elements of B\". So actually, the sphere has to contain all possible boxes in set B. Therefore, the radius must be at least as large as the maximum space diagonal of any box in B divided by 2. Because if there's a box with a larger space diagonal, then the sphere must accommodate that. So essentially, we need to find the maximum space diagonal among all boxes in B, then divide by 2, square that, and get the value of r^2.\n\nTherefore, the key is to maximize the space diagonal of the rectangular boxes given the constraints of surface area 54 and volume 23.\n\nThe space diagonal of a box with sides x, y, z is sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). So we need to maximize sqrt(x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2), given that 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 and xyz = 23. Since sqrt is a monotonic function, maximizing the space diagonal is equivalent to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2. Therefore, the problem reduces to maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 under the given constraints.\n\nSo, let me note down the problem:\n\nMaximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 subject to:\n\n1. 2(xy + yz + xz) = 54 \u21d2 xy + yz + xz = 27,\n\n2. xyz = 23.\n\nHmm, okay. So how do I approach this? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers? Since it's a constrained optimization problem. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can express variables in terms of each other. Let me consider variables x, y, z. Since we have symmetric equations, maybe assuming some symmetry in variables could help? But since the problem is to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, which is symmetric, perhaps the maximum occurs when two variables are equal? Or maybe when all variables are equal? Wait, but if all variables are equal, then it would be a cube. Let me check if that's possible.\n\nSuppose the box is a cube. Then x = y = z. Then surface area would be 6x\u00b2 = 54 \u21d2 x\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2 x = 3. Then the volume would be 27, but the given volume is 23. So that's not possible. So the box cannot be a cube. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal must be achieved by a non-cube box.\n\nAlternatively, maybe two sides are equal. Let me suppose that two variables are equal, say y = z. Then, let me set variables as x, y, y. Then the surface area becomes 2(xy + yx + y\u00b2) = 2(2xy + y\u00b2) = 4xy + 2y\u00b2 = 54 \u21d2 2xy + y\u00b2 = 27. The volume is x y\u00b2 = 23. Then, perhaps I can express x in terms of y from the volume equation and substitute into the surface area equation.\n\nSo, from the volume equation: x = 23/(y\u00b2). Then substitute into the surface area equation:\n\n2*(23/(y\u00b2))*y + y\u00b2 = 27 \u21d2 (46/y) + y\u00b2 = 27 \u21d2 y\u00b2 + 46/y = 27. Hmm, this is a bit messy. Let me rearrange it:\n\nMultiply both sides by y: y\u00b3 + 46 = 27y \u21d2 y\u00b3 - 27y + 46 = 0. Hmm, solving this cubic equation. Maybe I can try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 46 over 1, so \u00b11, \u00b12, \u00b123, \u00b146.\n\nTesting y = 1: 1 -27 +46 = 20 \u22600\n\ny = 2: 8 -54 +46 = 0. Oh! y=2 is a root. So, we can factor it as (y - 2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = 0. Let me check:\n\n(y -2)(y\u00b2 + 2y -23) = y\u00b3 +2y\u00b2 -23y -2y\u00b2 -4y +46 = y\u00b3 -27y +46. Yes, that's correct. So the roots are y=2 and roots of y\u00b2 +2y -23=0. The other roots would be y = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 +92)] /2 = [-2 \u00b1 sqrt(96)]/2 = [-2 \u00b1 4*sqrt(6)]/2 = -1 \u00b1 2*sqrt(6). Since y must be positive, only y = -1 + 2\u221a6 \u2248 -1 + 4.899 \u2248 3.899 is positive, but the other one is negative, so discard. So the real positive roots are y=2 and y\u22483.899.\n\nSo, when y=2, then x = 23/(y\u00b2) = 23/4 = 5.75. So then x = 23/(2)^2 = 23/4, y = z =2. So the dimensions would be (23/4, 2, 2). Let me check the surface area: 2(xy + yz + xz) = 2( (23/4 *2) + (2*2) + (23/4 *2) ) = 2( (23/2) +4 + (23/2) ) = 2(23/2 +23/2 +4) = 2(23 +4) = 2*27=54, which is correct. The volume is (23/4)*2*2 =23, so that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if y = -1 +2\u221a6, then let's see. Let me compute y \u2248 -1 +4.899\u22483.899. Then x =23/(y\u00b2). Let me compute that numerically. Let me see if that gives another solution. Let me check if that works. But perhaps the maximum x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 occurs at one of these points? Let me see.\n\nFirst, let's compute x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 for the case when y = z =2, x=23/4. Then:\n\nx\u00b2 = (23/4)^2 = 529/16 \u224833.0625,\n\ny\u00b2 = 4,\n\nz\u00b2 =4,\n\nTotal: 529/16 + 8 = (529 + 128)/16 = 657/16 \u224841.0625.\n\nAlternatively, if y is the other root, let's see. Let me take y = -1 +2\u221a6. Let me compute that exactly. Let me denote y = -1 +2\u221a6. Then y\u00b2 = ( -1 +2\u221a6 )\u00b2 =1 -4\u221a6 +24 =25 -4\u221a6. Then x =23/y\u00b2 =23/(25 -4\u221a6). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (25 +4\u221a6):\n\nx =23*(25 +4\u221a6)/[(25)^2 - (4\u221a6)^2] =23*(25 +4\u221a6)/(625 - 96) =23*(25 +4\u221a6)/529.\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator: 23 and 529 (which is 23\u00b2). So, x = (25 +4\u221a6)/23. Therefore, x is (25 +4\u221a6)/23.\n\nThen, x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = x\u00b2 + 2y\u00b2 (since z=y). Let's compute that:\n\nFirst compute x\u00b2:\n\n[(25 +4\u221a6)/23]^2 = (25\u00b2 + 2*25*4\u221a6 + (4\u221a6)^2)/23\u00b2\n\n= (625 + 200\u221a6 + 16*6)/529\n\n= (625 + 200\u221a6 + 96)/529\n\n= (721 + 200\u221a6)/529\n\nThen 2y\u00b2 =2*(25 -4\u221a6) =50 -8\u221a6.\n\nTherefore, total x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (721 +200\u221a6)/529 +50 -8\u221a6.\n\nConvert 50 to 50*(529/529) and -8\u221a6 to (-8\u221a6)*(529/529):\n\nWait, actually, to add fractions, we need a common denominator. Let me write everything over 529:\n\n= [721 + 200\u221a6 + 50*529 -8\u221a6*529]/529\n\nWait, that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, let me compute numerically:\n\nFirst, compute x \u2248 (25 +4*2.449)/23 \u2248 (25 +9.796)/23 \u224834.796/23\u22481.513.\n\nThen x\u00b2 \u2248 (1.513)^2\u22482.289.\n\ny\u22483.899, so y\u00b2\u224815.204, so 2y\u00b2\u224830.408.\n\nTotal x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 \u22482.289 +30.408\u224832.697.\n\nWait, that's way less than the previous case where it was approximately 41.06. So the maximum seems to occur at y=2, giving a larger space diagonal. Hmm, so that suggests that when y=z=2, x=23/4\u22485.75, the sum x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is higher. So perhaps that is the maximum?\n\nWait, but maybe there's a case where all variables are different, which could give a higher sum? Because maybe assuming two variables equal is restrictive? Hmm. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can approach this problem using Lagrange multipliers. Let me set up the Lagrangian.\n\nLet me denote the function to maximize as f(x,y,z) =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2,\n\nsubject to the constraints:\n\ng(x,y,z)=xy + yz + xz =27,\n\nh(x,y,z)=xyz=23.\n\nWe need to use two constraints, so the Lagrangian would be:\n\nL = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 - \u03bb(xy + yz + xz -27) - \u03bc(xyz -23).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x = 2x - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc(yz) =0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202y =2y - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc(xz)=0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202z =2z - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc(xy)=0,\n\nAnd the constraints:\n\nxy + yz + xz =27,\n\nxyz=23.\n\nHmm, this system looks a bit complicated. Maybe there's symmetry here. Suppose two variables are equal, say y = z. Then, perhaps this is the case that gives the maximum. Let's check if the solution we found earlier satisfies the Lagrangian conditions.\n\nSuppose y = z. Let me denote variables as x, y, y. Then, the Lagrangian equations would be:\n\nFor x:\n\n2x - \u03bb( y + y ) - \u03bc(y*y) = 0 \u21d2 2x - 2\u03bb y - \u03bc y\u00b2 =0,\n\nFor y:\n\n2y - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc(x y )=0,\n\nSame for the other y (since z=y), so that's the same equation as above.\n\nSo, the equations become:\n\n1) 2x - 2\u03bb y - \u03bc y\u00b2 =0,\n\n2) 2y - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y =0,\n\nAdditionally, the constraints:\n\nxy + y\u00b2 + x y =27 \u21d2 2xy + y\u00b2=27,\n\nand x y\u00b2 =23.\n\nSo, let me see if with the solution x=23/(y\u00b2), y=2, which gives x=23/4, y=2, then:\n\nLet me compute the Lagrangian equations:\n\nFirst equation:\n\n2*(23/4) -2\u03bb*2 - \u03bc*(2)^2 =0 \u21d2 (23/2) -4\u03bb -4\u03bc =0,\n\nSecond equation:\n\n2*2 - \u03bb( (23/4) +2 ) - \u03bc*(23/4)*2 =0 \u21d24 - \u03bb*(31/4) - \u03bc*(23/2)=0.\n\nSo now we can set up equations for \u03bb and \u03bc.\n\nLet me denote equation 1: 23/2 -4\u03bb -4\u03bc =0,\n\nequation 2:4 - (31/4)\u03bb - (23/2)\u03bc =0.\n\nLet me solve these equations. Let me denote equation 1 as:\n\n4\u03bb +4\u03bc =23/2,\n\ndivide both sides by 4:\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc =23/8.\n\nEquation 2:\n\nMultiply all terms by 4 to eliminate denominators:\n\n16 -31\u03bb -46\u03bc =0,\n\nso,\n\n-31\u03bb -46\u03bc = -16 \u21d231\u03bb +46\u03bc =16.\n\nNow, we have:\n\nFrom equation 1: \u03bb =23/8 - \u03bc.\n\nSubstitute into equation 2:\n\n31*(23/8 - \u03bc) +46\u03bc =16,\n\nCompute 31*(23/8) = (31*23)/8 =713/8,\n\nSo:\n\n713/8 -31\u03bc +46\u03bc =16,\n\nCombine terms:\n\n713/8 +15\u03bc =16,\n\nThen,\n\n15\u03bc =16 -713/8 = (128/8 -713/8)= (-585)/8,\n\nThus \u03bc = (-585)/(8*15) = -585/120 = -39/8.\n\nThen, \u03bb =23/8 - (-39/8)= (23 +39)/8=62/8=31/4.\n\nSo, \u03bb=31/4 and \u03bc= -39/8. Since these are real numbers, the solution satisfies the Lagrangian conditions, so that critical point is valid. So that is a local maximum or minimum?\n\nHmm, but since we are looking for the maximum of x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, we need to check whether this is indeed the maximum. Since when we considered the other root, the value was lower, perhaps this is the maximum. However, to be thorough, maybe there's another critical point when variables are all different. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps this is the only critical point, so this would be the maximum. Alternatively, maybe there are other critical points. But given that when variables are all different, it's hard to compute, but since the symmetric case gives a higher value, maybe that is indeed the maximum. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another approach. Let me recall that for given surface area and volume, the space diagonal is maximized when the box is as \"stretched out\" as possible. Since when variables are unequal, the diagonal can be larger. Wait, but in the case of the cube, the diagonal is sqrt(3)x. Here, since the volume is less than the cube's volume (23 vs 27), perhaps making one side longer and others shorter can increase the diagonal?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when two sides are as small as possible? Hmm, not sure. Let me think of another method.\n\nAlternatively, using the method of substitution. Let me see if I can express x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 in terms of the given constraints.\n\nWe know that (x + y + z)^2 = x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 + 2(xy + yz +xz).\n\nWe have that xy + yz +xz =27, so,\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2*27 = (x + y + z)^2 -54.\n\nTherefore, to maximize x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2, we need to maximize (x + y + z)^2, which in turn requires maximizing x + y + z.\n\nTherefore, maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is equivalent to maximizing x + y + z. So perhaps we can instead try to maximize x + y + z given the constraints?\n\nHmm, that might be simpler. Let me see.\n\nSo, problem reduces to maximizing x + y + z, given that xy + yz + xz =27 and xyz=23.\n\nHmm, perhaps using AM \u2265 GM or other inequalities? But with these constraints, it's tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider variables as roots of a cubic equation. Let me think.\n\nSuppose x, y, z are positive real numbers. Let me consider them as roots of the cubic equation t^3 - pt\u00b2 + qt - r =0, where p =x + y + z, q =xy + yz +xz =27, and r =xyz=23. So the cubic equation is t\u00b3 - p t\u00b2 +27 t -23=0.\n\nWe need to find the maximum possible p. So the problem reduces to finding the maximum possible p where such real positive roots exist. Hmm, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the method of Lagrange multipliers again, but for maximizing p =x + y + z with the given constraints. Let me try that.\n\nLet me set up the Lagrangian for maximizing p =x + y + z,\n\nsubject to:\n\ng(x,y,z)=xy + yz +xz -27 =0,\n\nh(x,y,z)=xyz -23 =0.\n\nThen, the Lagrangian is:\n\nL =x + y + z - \u03bb(xy + yz +xz -27) - \u03bc(xyz -23).\n\nTaking partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202x =1 - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc(y z)=0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202y =1 - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc(x z)=0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202z =1 - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc(x y)=0,\n\nConstraints:\n\nxy + yz +xz =27,\n\nxyz=23.\n\nHmm, this is similar to the previous Lagrangian but with a different objective function. However, perhaps the critical points are the same? Let me see.\n\nSuppose again that two variables are equal, say y = z. Let me see if the solution we found earlier also satisfies these equations.\n\nLet me take x=23/(y\u00b2), y = z=2. Then, let's check the Lagrangian equations here.\n\nFirst, compute the partial derivatives equations:\n\nFor x:\n\n1 - \u03bb( y + z ) - \u03bc(y z)=0,\n\nSince y = z =2,\n\n1 - \u03bb(4) - \u03bc(4)=0 \u21d21 -4\u03bb -4\u03bc =0,\n\nFor y:\n\n1 - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc(x z)=0,\n\nHere x=23/4, z=2,\n\n1 - \u03bb(23/4 +2 ) - \u03bc( (23/4)*2 )=0 \u21d21 - \u03bb*(31/4) - \u03bc*(23/2)=0,\n\nSame as before. So the equations are same as before. So if we set up the same Lagrangian equations, then the solution would be same. So, in this case, the maximum of x+y+z is achieved at that point?\n\nWait, but in this case, we are trying to maximize x+y+z, so perhaps that's the case. Let me see, if I proceed with this, then perhaps the maximum p is x+y+z = (23/4) +2 +2 = (23/4 +4)= 39/4 \u22489.75.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the other solution with y\u22483.899, then x\u22481.513, so x + y + z\u22481.513+3.899+3.899\u22489.311, which is less than 9.75. So that would mean that the maximum p is indeed 39/4, so the maximum x + y + z is 39/4, so the maximum x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 is (39/4)^2 -54.\n\nLet me compute that:\n\n(39/4)^2 = (1521)/16,\n\n1521 divided by 16 is 95.0625,\n\n95.0625 -54 =41.0625, which matches the previous value of 657/16 (since 657 divided by 16 is 41.0625). Therefore, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, that critical point is indeed the maximum. Therefore, the maximum space diagonal squared is 657/16, so the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16)=sqrt(657)/4. Therefore, the radius would be half of that, so sqrt(657)/8, so radius squared is (657)/(64). Wait, hold on:\n\nWait, the space diagonal squared is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 = 657/16. Therefore, the space diagonal is sqrt(657/16). The radius of the sphere must be at least half of that, so radius r = (1/2)*sqrt(657/16) = sqrt(657)/ (8). Therefore, r squared is (657)/(64). Therefore, the answer would be 657 + 64? Wait, 657 and 64. Are they coprime? Let me check.\n\nFirst, check if 657 and 64 have any common factors. 64 is 2^6. 657 divided by 2 is 328.5, so not divisible by 2. 6+5+7=18, so 657 is divisible by 3 (since 18 is divisible by 3). 657 divided by 3 is 219, then 219 divided by 3 is 73. So 657 = 3*3*73. 73 is a prime number. 64 is 2^6, so no common factors. Therefore, 657/64 is reduced, so p=657, q=64, so p+q=657+64=721. Therefore, the answer is 721.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make an error.\n\nFirst, the space diagonal squared is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =657/16. Therefore, the radius of the sphere is half the space diagonal, so radius squared is ( (sqrt(657/16)) /2 )\u00b2 = (657/16)/4 =657/64. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, 657 and 64 are coprime since 657 factors into 3\u00b2\u00d773 and 64 is 2\u2076. No common factors. So p+q is indeed 657+64=721. Hmm, but before I get too confident, let me check if there could be another configuration where the space diagonal is larger.\n\nSuppose instead of setting two variables equal, there is a different configuration where all three variables are different, leading to a larger space diagonal. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using Lagrange multipliers for the original problem (maximizing x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2). Let's see if when variables are not equal, there's a solution.\n\nLet me assume variables are all different. Let me see the Lagrangian equations again:\n\nFor the original problem of maximizing f =x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + z\u00b2,\n\nthe Lagrangian equations were:\n\n2x - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z =0,\n\n2y - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z =0,\n\n2z - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y =0,\n\nwith constraints:\n\nxy + yz +xz =27,\n\nxyz=23.\n\nSuppose variables are not equal. Let me see if there's a solution where variables are not equal. Let me try to subtract equations to find relations between variables.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\n[2y - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z] - [2x - \u03bb(y + z) - \u03bc y z] =0,\n\n2y -2x -\u03bb(x + z - y - z) - \u03bc(x z - y z)=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(y -x) -\u03bb(x - y) - \u03bc z(x - y)=0,\n\nFactor (y -x):\n\n(y -x)(-2 + \u03bb + \u03bc z)=0.\n\nSimilarly, since variables are different, y \u2260x, so:\n\n-2 + \u03bb + \u03bc z =0 \u21d2 \u03bb + \u03bc z =2.\n\nSimilarly, subtract the second and third equations:\n\n[2z - \u03bb(x + y) - \u03bc x y] - [2y - \u03bb(x + z) - \u03bc x z] =0,\n\n2z -2y -\u03bb(x + y -x - z) - \u03bc(x y -x z)=0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n2(z - y) -\u03bb(y - z) -\u03bc x(y - z)=0,\n\nFactor (z - y):\n\n(z - y)(-2 + \u03bb + \u03bc x)=0,\n\nSince z \u2260 y (assuming all variables different), then:\n\n-2 + \u03bb + \u03bc x =0 \u21d2 \u03bb + \u03bc x=2.\n\nSimilarly, from first subtraction, we had \u03bb + \u03bc z =2,\n\nSo,\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc z =2,\n\n\u03bb + \u03bc x =2,\n\nTherefore, subtract these two equations:\n\n\u03bc(z -x)=0.\n\nSince \u03bc \u22600 (otherwise from original equations, we would have 2x = \u03bb(y+z), etc., but if \u03bc=0, then equations become 2x = \u03bb(y+z), 2y=\u03bb(x+z), 2z=\u03bb(x+y). Then solving those, but perhaps leading to a cube which isn't our case. Since we have volume 23\u226027, so \u03bc can't be zero.\n\nTherefore, since \u03bc \u22600, then z -x=0 \u21d2 z =x. But that contradicts the assumption that all variables are different. Therefore, this suggests that variables cannot all be different. So either two variables are equal or all three are equal. Since all three equal is impossible (as that gives volume 27\u226023), so only two variables can be equal. Hence the maximum occurs when two variables are equal. Therefore, the solution we found earlier is indeed the maximum. Therefore, the answer is 657/64, so 657+64=721.\n\nWait, but just to be thorough, let me check if there is another case where two different variables are equal. For example, maybe x = z, but not y. But due to symmetry, it would result in the same maximum. For instance, if x = z, then the same equations would result in the same maximum value. Therefore, the maximum is unique up to permutation of variables.\n\nTherefore, I think that the answer is indeed 721.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{721}\n\n\nGiven a set \\(\\mathcal{B}\\) of rectangular boxes with surface area 54 and volume 23, we need to find the radius \\(r\\) of the smallest sphere that can contain each of these boxes. The radius \\(r\\) is half the space diagonal of the box with the maximum space diagonal. We need to maximize \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\) under the constraints \\(2(xy + yz + xz) = 54\\) and \\(xyz = 23\\).\n\nFirst, we note that the surface area constraint simplifies to \\(xy + yz + xz = 27\\). We assume two variables are equal, say \\(y = z\\), leading to the equations:\n\\[\n2(xy + y^2) = 27 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x y^2 = 23.\n\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\) in terms of \\(y\\) from the volume equation, we get \\(x = \\frac{23}{y^2}\\). Substituting this into the surface area equation:\n\\[\n2\\left(\\frac{23}{y^2} \\cdot y + y^2\\right) = 27 \\implies \\frac{46}{y} + y^2 = 27.\n\\]\nMultiplying through by \\(y\\) and rearranging gives the cubic equation:\n\\[\ny^3 - 27y + 46 = 0.\n\\]\nTesting possible rational roots, we find \\(y = 2\\) is a solution. This gives \\(x = \\frac{23}{4}\\), \\(y = 2\\), and \\(z = 2\\). \n\nCalculating \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\\) for these values:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{23}{4}\\right)^2 + 2^2 + 2^2 = \\frac{529}{16} + 4 + 4 = \\frac{529}{16} + \\frac{128}{16} = \\frac{657}{16}.\n\\]\nThe space diagonal squared is \\(\\frac{657}{16}\\), so the radius \\(r\\) of the sphere is half the space diagonal:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\frac{657}{16}}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{657}}{8}.\n\\]\nThus, \\(r^2 = \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{657}}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{657}{64}\\). Since 657 and 64 are coprime, we have \\(p = 657\\) and \\(q = 64\\), leading to \\(p + q = 657 + 64 = 721\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{721}\n\\]",
