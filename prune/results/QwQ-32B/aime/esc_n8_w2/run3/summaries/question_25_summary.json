      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me see. I need to find the number of residents who own all four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. Hmm, since every resident owns candy hearts, that simplifies things a bit. Wait, so candy hearts are owned by everyone. That means the only variables here are the other three items. But let me think through this carefully.\n\nThe problem says there are 900 residents. Each owns a bag of candy hearts, so that's 900 people. Then, some also have diamond rings, golf clubs, or garden spades. The counts given are:\n\n- 195 own a diamond ring (D)\n- 367 own a set of golf clubs (G)\n- 562 own a garden spade (S)\n\nAdditionally, 437 own exactly two of these things (excluding candy hearts?), and 234 own exactly three of these things. Wait, does \"exactly two\" and \"exactly three\" include the candy hearts? The problem says \"of these things\"\u2014but the first sentence lists four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. So \"these things\" refers to all four? Hmm, but since everyone owns candy hearts, if someone owns exactly two things, they must own candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, exactly three would be candy hearts plus two others. And exactly four would be all four.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"exactly two of these things\"\u2014so that would include the possibility of including candy hearts or not? Wait, no, since everyone has candy hearts. So actually, if someone owns exactly two of the four items, they must have candy hearts plus one other. Because they can't have two without candy hearts since everyone has candy hearts. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the problem says \"each of the 900 residents owns a bag of candy hearts.\" So candy hearts are universal. Therefore, when they say \"exactly two of these things,\" they must mean exactly two of the four items, but since candy hearts are already owned by everyone, those people who have exactly two must have the candy hearts plus one other. Similarly, those with exactly three must have candy hearts plus two others, and those with all four would be candy hearts plus the other three. Therefore, the counts given for exactly two and exactly three must be considering the four items, but with candy hearts included in all of them.\n\nTherefore, to model this, perhaps we can think of the other three items (D, G, S) and candy hearts (C). Since C is owned by everyone, the total number of people is 900. Let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let the variables be as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- a = number of people who own only C (so none of D, G, S)\n- b = number of people who own C and D only\n- c = number of people who own C and G only\n- d = number of people who own C and S only\n- e = number of people who own C, D, G only\n- f = number of people who own C, D, S only\n- g = number of people who own C, G, S only\n- h = number of people who own all four: C, D, G, S\n\nWait, but since everyone has C, the total is a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900.\n\nNow, the problem says that 437 own exactly two of these things. Since exactly two would mean C plus one other, so that would be the people in b, c, d. So the total of b + c + d = 437.\n\nSimilarly, those who own exactly three of these things would be the people who have C plus two others, so that's e + f + g = 234.\n\nAnd those who own all four are h, which is what we need to find.\n\nAdditionally, the counts for each item (excluding C) are given:\n\n- Number of people who own D: This includes everyone who has D plus C, so that would be b (C&D only) + e (C&D&G) + f (C&D&S) + h (all four). So total D owners: b + e + f + h = 195.\n\nSimilarly for G: c + e + g + h = 367.\n\nFor S: d + f + g + h = 562.\n\nWe need to find h.\n\nHmm, so we have several equations here. Let me list them all:\n\n1. a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h = 900\n2. b + c + d = 437 (exactly two items)\n3. e + f + g = 234 (exactly three items)\n4. b + e + f + h = 195 (D owners)\n5. c + e + g + h = 367 (G owners)\n6. d + f + g + h = 562 (S owners)\n\nWe need to find h.\n\nFirst, let's see if we can express a in terms of the other variables. From equation 1:\n\na = 900 - (b + c + d + e + f + g + h)\n\nBut from equations 2 and 3, b + c + d = 437 and e + f + g = 234. So substituting:\n\na = 900 - (437 + 234 + h) = 900 - 671 - h = 229 - h.\n\nSo a = 229 - h. Hmm, okay.\n\nNow, let's try to find equations involving h. Let's consider equations 4,5,6. Let me write them again:\n\n4. b + e + f + h = 195\n\n5. c + e + g + h = 367\n\n6. d + f + g + h = 562\n\nHmm, perhaps adding equations 4,5,6 together:\n\n(b + e + f + h) + (c + e + g + h) + (d + f + g + h) = 195 + 367 + 562\n\nLet me compute the left side:\n\nb + c + d + (e + e) + (f + f) + (g + g) + (h + h + h) \n\nWait, actually let me count term by term:\n\nFirst equation terms: b, e, f, h\n\nSecond: c, e, g, h\n\nThird: d, f, g, h\n\nSo adding all together:\n\nb + c + d + (e + e) + (f + f) + (g + g) + (h + h + h) \n\nSo that is:\n\n(b + c + d) + 2(e + f + g) + 3h \n\nThe right side is 195 + 367 + 562 = let me compute that:\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124? Wait no, wait 195 + 367 is 562? Wait 195 + 367: 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. Then 562 + 562 would be 1124, but the third term is 562, so total 195+367+562 is 195+367 is 562, plus 562 gives 1124. Yes, so the right side is 1124.\n\nTherefore, the left side:\n\n(b + c + d) + 2(e + f + g) + 3h = 1124\n\nWe know from equations 2 and 3 that (b + c + d) = 437 and (e + f + g) = 234. Substituting those in:\n\n437 + 2*(234) + 3h = 1124\n\nCompute 2*234 = 468. So:\n\n437 + 468 + 3h = 1124\n\nAdding 437 + 468: 400 + 400 = 800, 37 + 68 = 105, so total 905. So 905 + 3h = 1124\n\nSubtract 905 from both sides:\n\n3h = 1124 - 905 = 219\n\nTherefore, h = 219 / 3 = 73.\n\nWait, so h is 73? Let me check that again.\n\nWait 1124 minus 905: 1124 - 900 = 224, minus 5 more is 219. So yes. 219 divided by 3 is 73. So h=73.\n\nHmm, so is that the answer? Let me see if that makes sense. Let me verify with the equations.\n\nWait, let me check if that works with the other equations. Let me see. Let me check equations 4,5,6 with h=73.\n\nLet me denote equations 4,5,6 again:\n\n4. b + e + f = 195 - h = 195 -73 = 122\n\n5. c + e + g = 367 - h = 367 -73 = 294\n\n6. d + f + g = 562 - h = 562 -73 = 489\n\nNow, also, from equation 2: b + c + d =437\n\nFrom equation 3: e + f + g =234\n\nLet me see if we can get the sum of equations 4,5,6 (excluding h):\n\nEquation4 left side: b + e + f =122\n\nEquation5 left side: c + e + g =294\n\nEquation6 left side: d + f + g =489\n\nAdding these three equations:\n\n(b + c + d) + (e + e) + (f + f) + (g + g) = 122 +294 +489\n\nLeft side: (b + c + d) + 2(e + f + g) \n\nWe know b + c + d =437 and e + f + g=234, so:\n\n437 + 2*234 = 437 + 468 = 905\n\nRight side: 122 + 294 = 416; 416 +489 = 905. Perfect, that checks out. So the equations are consistent. Therefore, h=73 is correct?\n\nHmm. Let me see if there's another way to check.\n\nAlso, let's see if the total a is 229 - h =229 -73=156. Since a is the number of people who own only candy hearts. That seems plausible.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the total number of people:\n\na + (b + c + d) + (e + f + g) + h = 156 +437 +234 +73 = let's compute:\n\n156 +437 = 593; 593 +234=827; 827+73=900. Correct.\n\nTherefore, all equations are satisfied. Therefore, the answer should be 73. Hmm, so I think that's right.\n\nWait, but let me just think again if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says \"the number of residents of Aimeville who own all four of these things.\" Since all residents own candy hearts, then the ones who own all four are exactly h, which is 73, so that should be the answer. Yes.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 73.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}\n",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. Hmm, so there are 900 residents in Aimeville. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's one thing everyone has. Then there are three other items mentioned: diamond rings (195 people), golf clubs (367), and garden spades (562). Also, we know that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four.\n\nWait a second, since everyone has the candy hearts, actually, the candy hearts are owned by all, so maybe we can think of the other three items as the variables here. Let me see. Since the candy hearts are owned by everyone, when they mention owning \"exactly two\" or \"exactly three\" of these things, does that include the candy hearts? Hmm, the problem says \"exactly two of these things\" and \"exactly three of these things.\" The \"these things\" probably refers to all four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone has the candy hearts, owning exactly two things would mean one of the other three plus the candy hearts. Similarly, exactly three would mean two of the other three plus the candy hearts. And owning all four would be all three plus the candy hearts. \n\nSo maybe it's better to model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall the formula for four sets. But since the candy hearts are universal, maybe we can adjust the problem to consider only the other three items, and then account for the candy hearts?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of all four items: D (diamond), G (golf clubs), S (spade), and C (candy hearts). Since everyone owns C, the total number of residents is 900, so C has 900 members. The other sets are subsets of C. \n\nWe need to find the number of people who own all four, which is D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C. Since everyone is in C, this is just D \u2229 G \u2229 S.\n\nThe problem gives the number of people who own exactly two of the four items (including C?), and exactly three. Let me parse that again: \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nSince each person owns at least the candy hearts, the \"exactly two\" would mean they own C plus one other item. Similarly, \"exactly three\" would mean C plus two others, and \"all four\" would be C plus all three others.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables for the different overlaps. Let me consider the three non-universal items: D, G, S. Since everyone has C, the ownership of the other items can be considered in terms of their overlaps. Let me use standard inclusion-exclusion variables for three sets.\n\nLet\u2019s let a = number of people who own only D (but not G, S, or more? Wait, no, since they have C, so actually, owning only D would mean D and C, but not G or S. Similarly, owning exactly two would be owning D and G but not S or anything else except C? Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the other three items. Let me see:\n\nLet me consider the three items D, G, S. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- d = number of people who own D only (but since they also have C, actually, it's D and C, but not G or S). Wait, but the problem counts \"exactly two of these things\"\u2014so if someone owns D and C, that's two things. So \"exactly two\" would include those who have C plus one other. Similarly, \"exactly three\" would be C plus two others, and \"all four\" is C plus all three. \n\nTherefore, the total number of people can be partitioned into those who own:\n\n- Only C (so none of D, G, S): Let\u2019s call this x.\n\n- Exactly one other item plus C: So D only, G only, S only. Let me denote the counts as a, b, c respectively.\n\n- Exactly two other items plus C: So D and G, D and S, G and S. Let me denote these as d_g, d_s, g_s.\n\n- Exactly three other items plus C: D, G, and S plus C. Let's denote this as dgs.\n\n- All four items: D, G, S, and C, which is exactly the intersection D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C, which is what we need to find. But wait, actually, that would be the same as the people who have all three D, G, S plus C, so that's the same as D \u2229 G \u2229 S. Let me denote this as t (the value we need to find).\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem states that 234 residents own exactly three of these things. Since \"exactly three\" would include C plus two others? Wait no: exactly three of the four items. Since they must have C, exactly three would mean C plus two of the other three. Wait, but three items total. So for example, if someone has C, D, G, that's three items, so they would be counted in the \"exactly three\" category. Similarly, C, D, S or C, G, S. The ones who have all four would have C, D, G, S, so that's four items, so they are not in \"exactly three\". Similarly, the ones with exactly two would have C plus one other. So the counts are:\n\nTotal people = those with only C (x) + those with exactly one other (a + b + c) + those with exactly two others (d_g + d_s + g_s) + those with exactly three others (dgs) + those with all four (t). \n\nWait, but the problem says \"exactly three of these things\"\u2014so exactly three items, which would correspond to having two of D, G, S plus C. So the \"exactly three\" is dgs (the ones with all three non-C items plus C) plus the ones with two non-C items plus C. Wait, no, no. Wait, actually, if someone has exactly three items, since they must have C, that requires that they have exactly two of D, G, S. Wait, no. Wait, three items in total. Since they have C, the other two items must be exactly two of D, G, S. Wait, no\u2014if someone has three items, that's C plus two of the others. So the number of people with exactly three items is the sum of the three pairs (D&G, D&S, G&S) minus three times the triple (since those in the triple are counted in all three pairs). Wait, actually, no. Wait, let's clarify.\n\nLet me think again. Let me denote variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- Let\u2019s define variables for the intersections among D, G, S, excluding C for now, but remembering that everyone has C. Hmm, maybe this is getting confusing. Let me try using standard inclusion-exclusion variables for the three sets D, G, S. But since everyone has C, the total number of people is the same as the total in the union of D, G, S plus those who have none of D, G, S but have C.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem with the four sets, but since C is universal, we can simplify.\n\nLet me consider the three items D, G, S. Let\u2019s let the total number of people who own at least one of these three be T. Since everyone has C, the total number of people is 900, so those who don't own any of D, G, S would be 900 - T. But the problem mentions that 437 own exactly two of the four things, which would correspond to owning exactly two items (including C). Wait, maybe I need to structure this carefully.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but since C is universal, maybe it can be simplified.\n\nAlternatively, since all residents have C, the problem can be rephrased in terms of the other three items. Let me think of the problem as:\n\nEach person has C, so the question is about the ownership of D, G, S. The total number of people is 900. The number who own exactly two items (including C) is 437, so that translates to exactly one of D, G, S (since they have C plus one more). The number who own exactly three items (including C) is 234, which would be exactly two of D, G, S (since three items total). The number who own all four items is exactly those who own all three of D, G, S (since they have C plus all three). The rest would be those who own none of D, G, S (so only C). \n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- Let\u2019s denote by a the number of people who own only D (i.e., D and C, but not G or S).\n\nSimilarly, b for only G, c for only S.\n\nThen, the number of people who own exactly two items (D and G, but not S; D and S, not G; G and S, not D) would be:\n\nd_g (D and G but not S), d_s (D and S but not G), g_s (G and S but not D). Each of these would be the counts for exactly two items (since they have C plus two others? Wait no: D and G plus C is three items, so that would be three items. Wait, confusion here.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps my confusion arises from not properly considering how the counts translate. Let me clarify:\n\nSince everyone has C, the total items someone can own are:\n\n- Only C: 1 item.\n\n- C plus one of D, G, S: 2 items.\n\n- C plus two of D, G, S: 3 items.\n\n- C plus all three of D, G, S: 4 items.\n\nTherefore, when the problem says \"exactly two of these things,\" it refers to owning exactly two items in total, which would mean C plus one other (so only one of D, G, S). \n\nSimilarly, \"exactly three of these things\" means owning three items in total: C plus two of D, G, S. \n\nAnd \"all four\" is C plus all three of D, G, S.\n\nTherefore, the counts are as follows:\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet:\n\n- x = number of people who own only C (1 item).\n\n- a = number owning C + D only (so D but not G or S),\n\n- b = C + G only,\n\n- c = C + S only,\n\n- d_g = C + D + G only (so exactly three items),\n\n- d_s = C + D + S only,\n\n- g_s = C + G + S only,\n\n- t = C + D + G + S (all four items).\n\nThen, the total number of people is:\n\nx + a + b + c + d_g + d_s + g_s + t = 900.\n\nThe number of people who own exactly two items (i.e., a, b, c) is a + b + c = 437.\n\nThe number who own exactly three items (d_g + d_s + g_s) = 234.\n\nWe need to find t, the number who own all four.\n\nAdditionally, the total number of people who own D is the number of people who have D in any combination. That would be a + d_g + d_s + t = 195.\n\nSimilarly for G: b + d_g + g_s + t = 367,\n\nand S: c + d_s + g_s + t = 562.\n\nSo now we have several equations.\n\nLet me list all equations:\n\n1. x + a + b + c + d_g + d_s + g_s + t = 900\n\n2. a + b + c = 437 (exactly two items)\n\n3. d_g + d_s + g_s = 234 (exactly three items)\n\n4. a + d_g + d_s + t = 195 (D owners)\n\n5. b + d_g + g_s + t = 367 (G owners)\n\n6. c + d_s + g_s + t = 562 (S owners)\n\nWe need to find t.\n\nWe can try to solve these equations. Let's see.\n\nFirst, from equations 2, 3, and the first equation, we can express x as:\n\nx = 900 - [ (a + b + c) + (d_g + d_s + g_s) + t ]\n\n= 900 - (437 + 234 + t) = 900 - 671 - t = 229 - t.\n\nBut since x is the number of people who own only C, it must be non-negative, so 229 - t \u2265 0 \u21d2 t \u2264 229. But we don't know yet.\n\nNow, let's consider equations 4,5,6.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\n4. a = 195 - (d_g + d_s + t)\n\nWait, equation 4: a = 195 - (d_g + d_s + t)\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: b = 367 - (d_g + g_s + t)\n\nEquation 6: c = 562 - (d_s + g_s + t)\n\nHmm, perhaps we can substitute these into equation 2 (a + b + c = 437).\n\nSo substituting:\n\n[195 - (d_g + d_s + t)] + [367 - (d_g + g_s + t)] + [562 - (d_s + g_s + t)] = 437\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 195 - d_g - d_s - t\n\nSecond term: 367 - d_g - g_s - t\n\nThird term: 562 - d_s - g_s - t\n\nAdding all together:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 - [ (d_g + d_s + t) + (d_g + g_s + t) + (d_s + g_s + t) ] \n\nWait, let me compute the constants first:\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, 195 + 367 is 562? Wait no, 195 + 367 is 562? 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. Yes. Then 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, but the third term is 562, so total constants: 195 + 367 + 562 = 195+367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124. Correct.\n\nNow the subtracted terms:\n\nThe terms inside the brackets are:\n\n(d_g + d_s + t) + (d_g + g_s + t) + (d_s + g_s + t)\n\nLet me compute each:\n\nFirst group: d_g + d_s + t\n\nSecond group: d_g + g_s + t\n\nThird group: d_s + g_s + t\n\nAdding them together:\n\nd_g + d_s + t + d_g + g_s + t + d_s + g_s + t =\n\nLet me collect like terms:\n\nd_g terms: 2d_g (from first and second group)\n\nd_s terms: d_s + d_s = 2d_s (first and third)\n\ng_s terms: g_s + g_s = 2g_s (second and third)\n\nt terms: t + t + t = 3t\n\nSo total subtracted terms: 2d_g + 2d_s + 2g_s + 3t\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n1124 - [2d_g + 2d_s + 2g_s + 3t] = 437\n\nSo rearranged:\n\n2d_g + 2d_s + 2g_s + 3t = 1124 - 437 = 687\n\nDivide both sides by, maybe factor 2:\n\n2(d_g + d_s + g_s) + 3t = 687\n\nBut from equation 3, we know that d_g + d_s + g_s = 234. Let me substitute that in.\n\nSo:\n\n2*(234) + 3t = 687\n\n2*234 is 468, so:\n\n468 + 3t = 687\n\nSubtract 468:\n\n3t = 687 - 468 = 219\n\nTherefore, t = 219 / 3 = 73\n\nSo the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me verify the calculations step by step to be sure.\n\nFirst, equations 4,5,6:\n\nEquation 4: a + d_g + d_s + t = 195 \u21d2 a = 195 - d_g - d_s - t\n\nEquation 5: b = 367 - d_g - g_s - t\n\nEquation 6: c = 562 - d_s - g_s - t\n\nAdding a + b + c gives:\n\n(195 - d_g - d_s - t) + (367 - d_g - g_s - t) + (562 - d_s - g_s - t)\n\nYes, that's 195+367+562 = 1124\n\nThen the subtracted terms:\n\n(-d_g - d_s - t) + (-d_g - g_s - t) + (-d_s - g_s - t) =\n\n-2d_g - 2d_s - 2g_s - 3t\n\nWait, actually, when you add them all, it's:\n\nFirst term: -d_g -d_s - t\n\nSecond term: -d_g -g_s -t\n\nThird term: -d_s -g_s -t\n\nAdding together:\n\n- (d_g + d_s + t + d_g + g_s + t + d_s + g_s + t )\n\nWait, no, actually, the total subtraction is the sum of each of the terms in parentheses. Let me re-express:\n\nThe total subtraction is:\n\n( -d_g -d_s - t ) + ( -d_g -g_s - t ) + ( -d_s -g_s - t )\n\n= [ -d_g -d_g ] + [ -d_s -d_s ] + [ -g_s -g_s ] + [ -t -t -t ]\n\n= -2d_g -2d_s -2g_s -3t\n\nThus, total equation becomes:\n\n1124 - (2d_g + 2d_s + 2g_s +3t) = 437\n\nWhich leads to 2(d_g + d_s + g_s) + 3t = 1124 - 437 = 687.\n\nSince d_g +d_s +g_s is 234 (equation 3), substitute:\n\n2*234 = 468, so 468 + 3t = 687 \u21d2 3t = 219 \u21d2 t =73. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me check if this value of t makes sense. Let's see, if t is 73, then x = 229 - t = 229 -73=156.\n\nSo x is 156 people who own only C. That's okay.\n\nNow, let's check if the other variables make sense. Let me see if the equations for a, b, c are okay.\n\nWe can compute a, b, c:\n\nFrom equation 4: a = 195 - (d_g + d_s + t). But we don't know d_g and d_s individually. Hmm. Maybe we can find expressions for d_g, d_s, g_s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can check if the total equations hold.\n\nWait, let's see if we can compute d_g + d_s + g_s is 234, which is given. Since t is 73, let's see if the equations for a, b, c can have non-negative values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another equation we can use to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the total number of people. Let's see:\n\nTotal people = x + a + b + c + d_g + d_s + g_s + t\n\nWe know x=156, a+b+c=437, d_g+d_s+g_s=234, and t=73.\n\nSo total is 156 + 437 + 234 + 73 = let's compute:\n\n156 + 437 = 593\n\n593 + 234 = 827\n\n827 +73 = 900. Perfect, that adds up. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, unless I made an error in setting up the equations, the answer should be 73.\n\nWait, but let me think again if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says \"the number of residents who own all four of these things\"\u2014which includes the candy hearts. Since everyone has candy hearts, owning all four is equivalent to owning D, G, S in addition to C. So that's exactly the t we calculated. So yes, 73 is correct.\n\nHmm, seems okay. Let me check another way. Let me consider the total number of people owning each item:\n\nFor D: a + d_g + d_s + t = 195\n\nIf t=73, then a + d_g + d_s = 195 -73=122.\n\nSimilarly for G: b + d_g + g_s + t = 367 \u21d2 b + d_g + g_s = 367 -73=294.\n\nFor S: c + d_s + g_s + t =562 \u21d2 c +d_s +g_s=562 -73=489.\n\nNow, adding those three equations:\n\n(a + d_g + d_s) + (b + d_g + g_s) + (c + d_s + g_s) = 122 + 294 + 489.\n\nLet me compute left side:\n\na + b + c + 2d_g + 2d_s + 2g_s.\n\nThe right side is 122+294=416; 416+489=905.\n\nLeft side:\n\n(a + b + c) is 437, plus 2*(d_g +d_s +g_s)= 2*234=468. So total is 437 +468=905. Which matches the right side. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, everything checks out. So I think 73 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a diamond ring (D), a set of golf clubs (G), a garden spade (S), and a bag of candy hearts (C).

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to figure this problem out. Hmm, so there are 900 residents in Aimeville. Each of them owns a bag of candy hearts. So that's one thing everyone has. Then there are three other items mentioned: diamond rings (195 people), golf clubs (367), and garden spades (562). Also, we know that 437 own exactly two of these things, and 234 own exactly three. We need to find how many own all four.\n\nWait a second, since everyone has the candy hearts, actually, the candy hearts are owned by all, so maybe we can think of the other three items as the variables here. Let me see. Since the candy hearts are owned by everyone, when they mention owning \"exactly two\" or \"exactly three\" of these things, does that include the candy hearts? Hmm, the problem says \"exactly two of these things\" and \"exactly three of these things.\" The \"these things\" probably refers to all four items: diamond ring, golf clubs, garden spade, and candy hearts. But since everyone has the candy hearts, owning exactly two things would mean one of the other three plus the candy hearts. Similarly, exactly three would mean two of the other three plus the candy hearts. And owning all four would be all three plus the candy hearts. \n\nSo maybe it's better to model this using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Let me recall the formula for four sets. But since the candy hearts are universal, maybe we can adjust the problem to consider only the other three items, and then account for the candy hearts?\n\nAlternatively, let me think of all four items: D (diamond), G (golf clubs), S (spade), and C (candy hearts). Since everyone owns C, the total number of residents is 900, so C has 900 members. The other sets are subsets of C. \n\nWe need to find the number of people who own all four, which is D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C. Since everyone is in C, this is just D \u2229 G \u2229 S.\n\nThe problem gives the number of people who own exactly two of the four items (including C?), and exactly three. Let me parse that again: \"437 residents who own exactly two of these things, and 234 residents who own exactly three of these things.\"\n\nSince each person owns at least the candy hearts, the \"exactly two\" would mean they own C plus one other item. Similarly, \"exactly three\" would mean C plus two others, and \"all four\" would be C plus all three others.\n\nSo, let me denote:\n\nLet\u2019s define variables for the different overlaps. Let me consider the three non-universal items: D, G, S. Since everyone has C, the ownership of the other items can be considered in terms of their overlaps. Let me use standard inclusion-exclusion variables for three sets.\n\nLet\u2019s let a = number of people who own only D (but not G, S, or more? Wait, no, since they have C, so actually, owning only D would mean D and C, but not G or S. Similarly, owning exactly two would be owning D and G but not S or anything else except C? Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the other three items. Let me see:\n\nLet me consider the three items D, G, S. Let\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- d = number of people who own D only (but since they also have C, actually, it's D and C, but not G or S). Wait, but the problem counts \"exactly two of these things\"\u2014so if someone owns D and C, that's two things. So \"exactly two\" would include those who have C plus one other. Similarly, \"exactly three\" would be C plus two others, and \"all four\" is C plus all three. \n\nTherefore, the total number of people can be partitioned into those who own:\n\n- Only C (so none of D, G, S): Let\u2019s call this x.\n\n- Exactly one other item plus C: So D only, G only, S only. Let me denote the counts as a, b, c respectively.\n\n- Exactly two other items plus C: So D and G, D and S, G and S. Let me denote these as d_g, d_s, g_s.\n\n- Exactly three other items plus C: D, G, and S plus C. Let's denote this as dgs.\n\n- All four items: D, G, S, and C, which is exactly the intersection D \u2229 G \u2229 S \u2229 C, which is what we need to find. But wait, actually, that would be the same as the people who have all three D, G, S plus C, so that's the same as D \u2229 G \u2229 S. Let me denote this as t (the value we need to find).\n\nWait, but hold on. The problem states that 234 residents own exactly three of these things. Since \"exactly three\" would include C plus two others? Wait no: exactly three of the four items. Since they must have C, exactly three would mean C plus two of the other three. Wait, but three items total. So for example, if someone has C, D, G, that's three items, so they would be counted in the \"exactly three\" category. Similarly, C, D, S or C, G, S. The ones who have all four would have C, D, G, S, so that's four items, so they are not in \"exactly three\". Similarly, the ones with exactly two would have C plus one other. So the counts are:\n\nTotal people = those with only C (x) + those with exactly one other (a + b + c) + those with exactly two others (d_g + d_s + g_s) + those with exactly three others (dgs) + those with all four (t). \n\nWait, but the problem says \"exactly three of these things\"\u2014so exactly three items, which would correspond to having two of D, G, S plus C. So the \"exactly three\" is dgs (the ones with all three non-C items plus C) plus the ones with two non-C items plus C. Wait, no, no. Wait, actually, if someone has exactly three items, since they must have C, that requires that they have exactly two of D, G, S. Wait, no. Wait, three items in total. Since they have C, the other two items must be exactly two of D, G, S. Wait, no\u2014if someone has three items, that's C plus two of the others. So the number of people with exactly three items is the sum of the three pairs (D&G, D&S, G&S) minus three times the triple (since those in the triple are counted in all three pairs). Wait, actually, no. Wait, let's clarify.\n\nLet me think again. Let me denote variables as follows:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- Let\u2019s define variables for the intersections among D, G, S, excluding C for now, but remembering that everyone has C. Hmm, maybe this is getting confusing. Let me try using standard inclusion-exclusion variables for the three sets D, G, S. But since everyone has C, the total number of people is the same as the total in the union of D, G, S plus those who have none of D, G, S but have C.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to model the problem with the four sets, but since C is universal, we can simplify.\n\nLet me consider the three items D, G, S. Let\u2019s let the total number of people who own at least one of these three be T. Since everyone has C, the total number of people is 900, so those who don't own any of D, G, S would be 900 - T. But the problem mentions that 437 own exactly two of the four things, which would correspond to owning exactly two items (including C). Wait, maybe I need to structure this carefully.\n\nAlternatively, let me use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for four sets, but since C is universal, maybe it can be simplified.\n\nAlternatively, since all residents have C, the problem can be rephrased in terms of the other three items. Let me think of the problem as:\n\nEach person has C, so the question is about the ownership of D, G, S. The total number of people is 900. The number who own exactly two items (including C) is 437, so that translates to exactly one of D, G, S (since they have C plus one more). The number who own exactly three items (including C) is 234, which would be exactly two of D, G, S (since three items total). The number who own all four items is exactly those who own all three of D, G, S (since they have C plus all three). The rest would be those who own none of D, G, S (so only C). \n\nLet me formalize this:\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nLet\u2019s let:\n\n- Let\u2019s denote by a the number of people who own only D (i.e., D and C, but not G or S).\n\nSimilarly, b for only G, c for only S.\n\nThen, the number of people who own exactly two items (D and G, but not S; D and S, not G; G and S, not D) would be:\n\nd_g (D and G but not S), d_s (D and S but not G), g_s (G and S but not D). Each of these would be the counts for exactly two items (since they have C plus two others? Wait no: D and G plus C is three items, so that would be three items. Wait, confusion here.\n\nWait, hold on, perhaps my confusion arises from not properly considering how the counts translate. Let me clarify:\n\nSince everyone has C, the total items someone can own are:\n\n- Only C: 1 item.\n\n- C plus one of D, G, S: 2 items.\n\n- C plus two of D, G, S: 3 items.\n\n- C plus all three of D, G, S: 4 items.\n\nTherefore, when the problem says \"exactly two of these things,\" it refers to owning exactly two items in total, which would mean C plus one other (so only one of D, G, S). \n\nSimilarly, \"exactly three of these things\" means owning three items in total: C plus two of D, G, S. \n\nAnd \"all four\" is C plus all three of D, G, S.\n\nTherefore, the counts are as follows:\n\nLet me define variables:\n\nLet:\n\n- x = number of people who own only C (1 item).\n\n- a = number owning C + D only (so D but not G or S),\n\n- b = C + G only,\n\n- c = C + S only,\n\n- d_g = C + D + G only (so exactly three items),\n\n- d_s = C + D + S only,\n\n- g_s = C + G + S only,\n\n- t = C + D + G + S (all four items).\n\nThen, the total number of people is:\n\nx + a + b + c + d_g + d_s + g_s + t = 900.\n\nThe number of people who own exactly two items (i.e., a, b, c) is a + b + c = 437.\n\nThe number who own exactly three items (d_g + d_s + g_s) = 234.\n\nWe need to find t, the number who own all four.\n\nAdditionally, the total number of people who own D is the number of people who have D in any combination. That would be a + d_g + d_s + t = 195.\n\nSimilarly for G: b + d_g + g_s + t = 367,\n\nand S: c + d_s + g_s + t = 562.\n\nSo now we have several equations.\n\nLet me list all equations:\n\n1. x + a + b + c + d_g + d_s + g_s + t = 900\n\n2. a + b + c = 437 (exactly two items)\n\n3. d_g + d_s + g_s = 234 (exactly three items)\n\n4. a + d_g + d_s + t = 195 (D owners)\n\n5. b + d_g + g_s + t = 367 (G owners)\n\n6. c + d_s + g_s + t = 562 (S owners)\n\nWe need to find t.\n\nWe can try to solve these equations. Let's see.\n\nFirst, from equations 2, 3, and the first equation, we can express x as:\n\nx = 900 - [ (a + b + c) + (d_g + d_s + g_s) + t ]\n\n= 900 - (437 + 234 + t) = 900 - 671 - t = 229 - t.\n\nBut since x is the number of people who own only C, it must be non-negative, so 229 - t \u2265 0 \u21d2 t \u2264 229. But we don't know yet.\n\nNow, let's consider equations 4,5,6.\n\nLet me write them again:\n\n4. a = 195 - (d_g + d_s + t)\n\nWait, equation 4: a = 195 - (d_g + d_s + t)\n\nSimilarly, equation 5: b = 367 - (d_g + g_s + t)\n\nEquation 6: c = 562 - (d_s + g_s + t)\n\nHmm, perhaps we can substitute these into equation 2 (a + b + c = 437).\n\nSo substituting:\n\n[195 - (d_g + d_s + t)] + [367 - (d_g + g_s + t)] + [562 - (d_s + g_s + t)] = 437\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 195 - d_g - d_s - t\n\nSecond term: 367 - d_g - g_s - t\n\nThird term: 562 - d_s - g_s - t\n\nAdding all together:\n\n195 + 367 + 562 - [ (d_g + d_s + t) + (d_g + g_s + t) + (d_s + g_s + t) ] \n\nWait, let me compute the constants first:\n\n195 + 367 = 562; 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, 195 + 367 is 562? Wait no, 195 + 367 is 562? 195 + 300 is 495, plus 67 is 562. Yes. Then 562 + 562 = 1124. Wait, but the third term is 562, so total constants: 195 + 367 + 562 = 195+367 is 562, plus 562 is 1124. Correct.\n\nNow the subtracted terms:\n\nThe terms inside the brackets are:\n\n(d_g + d_s + t) + (d_g + g_s + t) + (d_s + g_s + t)\n\nLet me compute each:\n\nFirst group: d_g + d_s + t\n\nSecond group: d_g + g_s + t\n\nThird group: d_s + g_s + t\n\nAdding them together:\n\nd_g + d_s + t + d_g + g_s + t + d_s + g_s + t =\n\nLet me collect like terms:\n\nd_g terms: 2d_g (from first and second group)\n\nd_s terms: d_s + d_s = 2d_s (first and third)\n\ng_s terms: g_s + g_s = 2g_s (second and third)\n\nt terms: t + t + t = 3t\n\nSo total subtracted terms: 2d_g + 2d_s + 2g_s + 3t\n\nTherefore, the equation becomes:\n\n1124 - [2d_g + 2d_s + 2g_s + 3t] = 437\n\nSo rearranged:\n\n2d_g + 2d_s + 2g_s + 3t = 1124 - 437 = 687\n\nDivide both sides by, maybe factor 2:\n\n2(d_g + d_s + g_s) + 3t = 687\n\nBut from equation 3, we know that d_g + d_s + g_s = 234. Let me substitute that in.\n\nSo:\n\n2*(234) + 3t = 687\n\n2*234 is 468, so:\n\n468 + 3t = 687\n\nSubtract 468:\n\n3t = 687 - 468 = 219\n\nTherefore, t = 219 / 3 = 73\n\nSo the number of residents who own all four items is 73.\n\nWait, let me check that again. Let me verify the calculations step by step to be sure.\n\nFirst, equations 4,5,6:\n\nEquation 4: a + d_g + d_s + t = 195 \u21d2 a = 195 - d_g - d_s - t\n\nEquation 5: b = 367 - d_g - g_s - t\n\nEquation 6: c = 562 - d_s - g_s - t\n\nAdding a + b + c gives:\n\n(195 - d_g - d_s - t) + (367 - d_g - g_s - t) + (562 - d_s - g_s - t)\n\nYes, that's 195+367+562 = 1124\n\nThen the subtracted terms:\n\n(-d_g - d_s - t) + (-d_g - g_s - t) + (-d_s - g_s - t) =\n\n-2d_g - 2d_s - 2g_s - 3t\n\nWait, actually, when you add them all, it's:\n\nFirst term: -d_g -d_s - t\n\nSecond term: -d_g -g_s -t\n\nThird term: -d_s -g_s -t\n\nAdding together:\n\n- (d_g + d_s + t + d_g + g_s + t + d_s + g_s + t )\n\nWait, no, actually, the total subtraction is the sum of each of the terms in parentheses. Let me re-express:\n\nThe total subtraction is:\n\n( -d_g -d_s - t ) + ( -d_g -g_s - t ) + ( -d_s -g_s - t )\n\n= [ -d_g -d_g ] + [ -d_s -d_s ] + [ -g_s -g_s ] + [ -t -t -t ]\n\n= -2d_g -2d_s -2g_s -3t\n\nThus, total equation becomes:\n\n1124 - (2d_g + 2d_s + 2g_s +3t) = 437\n\nWhich leads to 2(d_g + d_s + g_s) + 3t = 1124 - 437 = 687.\n\nSince d_g +d_s +g_s is 234 (equation 3), substitute:\n\n2*234 = 468, so 468 + 3t = 687 \u21d2 3t = 219 \u21d2 t =73. That seems correct.\n\nNow, let me check if this value of t makes sense. Let's see, if t is 73, then x = 229 - t = 229 -73=156.\n\nSo x is 156 people who own only C. That's okay.\n\nNow, let's check if the other variables make sense. Let me see if the equations for a, b, c are okay.\n\nWe can compute a, b, c:\n\nFrom equation 4: a = 195 - (d_g + d_s + t). But we don't know d_g and d_s individually. Hmm. Maybe we can find expressions for d_g, d_s, g_s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can check if the total equations hold.\n\nWait, let's see if we can compute d_g + d_s + g_s is 234, which is given. Since t is 73, let's see if the equations for a, b, c can have non-negative values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another equation we can use to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, let me check the total number of people. Let's see:\n\nTotal people = x + a + b + c + d_g + d_s + g_s + t\n\nWe know x=156, a+b+c=437, d_g+d_s+g_s=234, and t=73.\n\nSo total is 156 + 437 + 234 + 73 = let's compute:\n\n156 + 437 = 593\n\n593 + 234 = 827\n\n827 +73 = 900. Perfect, that adds up. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, unless I made an error in setting up the equations, the answer should be 73.\n\nWait, but let me think again if I interpreted the problem correctly. The problem says \"the number of residents who own all four of these things\"\u2014which includes the candy hearts. Since everyone has candy hearts, owning all four is equivalent to owning D, G, S in addition to C. So that's exactly the t we calculated. So yes, 73 is correct.\n\nHmm, seems okay. Let me check another way. Let me consider the total number of people owning each item:\n\nFor D: a + d_g + d_s + t = 195\n\nIf t=73, then a + d_g + d_s = 195 -73=122.\n\nSimilarly for G: b + d_g + g_s + t = 367 \u21d2 b + d_g + g_s = 367 -73=294.\n\nFor S: c + d_s + g_s + t =562 \u21d2 c +d_s +g_s=562 -73=489.\n\nNow, adding those three equations:\n\n(a + d_g + d_s) + (b + d_g + g_s) + (c + d_s + g_s) = 122 + 294 + 489.\n\nLet me compute left side:\n\na + b + c + 2d_g + 2d_s + 2g_s.\n\nThe right side is 122+294=416; 416+489=905.\n\nLeft side:\n\n(a + b + c) is 437, plus 2*(d_g +d_s +g_s)= 2*234=468. So total is 437 +468=905. Which matches the right side. So that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, everything checks out. So I think 73 is correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{73}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of residents in Aimeville who own all four items: a diamond ring (D), a set of golf clubs (G), a garden spade (S), and a bag of candy hearts (C). Since every resident owns a bag of candy hearts (C), we can focus on the intersections of the other three items (D, G, S).\n\nWe are given:\n- Total residents: 900\n- Residents owning exactly two items (including C): 437\n- Residents owning exactly three items (including C): 234\n- Number of residents owning each item:\n  - Diamond ring (D): 195\n  - Golf clubs (G): 367\n  - Garden spade (S): 562\n\nWe define the following variables:\n- \\(a\\), \\(b\\), \\(c\\): Residents owning only D, G, S respectively (plus C).\n- \\(d_g\\), \\(d_s\\), \\(g_s\\): Residents owning exactly two of D, G, S (plus C).\n- \\(t\\): Residents owning all three of D, G, S (plus C).\n\nWe set up the equations based on the given information:\n1.
