      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some properties and formulas related to circumcenters, incenters, and maybe some coordinate geometry.\n\nFirst, let me note down what's given:\n\n1. Triangle ABC has circumradius R = 13.\n2. Inradius r = 6.\n3. The line segment IA (from incenter I to vertex A) is perpendicular to OI (the line from incenter I to circumcenter O).\n4. Need to find AB * AC.\n\nHmm, so maybe I can use some relations between the inradius, circumradius, and the distances between centers. Since IA is perpendicular to OI, that gives a right angle between those two lines. Maybe I can use coordinate geometry here, placing the triangle in a coordinate system to simplify calculations?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a formula or theorem that relates these elements. Let me think. \n\nI remember that in a triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter can be expressed in terms of R, r, and the sides. The formula is:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r)\n\nWait, is that right? Hmm, actually, I might be mixing up some formulas here. Let me recall properly. The formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Yes, that's it! OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, so if that's the case, then if IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there's a relation here?\n\nWait, but hold on. The formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr is a general formula for any triangle, right? Let me confirm. Hmm, actually, I think that formula might not be entirely accurate. Let me check again.\n\nActually, the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr\n\nYes, that's correct. I think that is the formula. So OI squared equals R squared minus twice R times r. Let me confirm this formula. For instance, in an equilateral triangle, the inradius is (a\u221a3)/6 and circumradius is (a\u221a3)/3. Then OI should be zero because both centers coincide. Plugging into the formula: R\u00b2 - 2Rr = ( (a\u221a3/3)^2 ) - 2*(a\u221a3/3)*(a\u221a3/6 ) = (a\u00b2/3) - 2*(a\u00b2/6) = (a\u00b2/3) - (a\u00b2/3) = 0. Okay, that works. So the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, in this problem, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Wait, but in the problem, we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, so maybe we can use some vector approach or coordinate geometry here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry by placing the triangle in a coordinate system where point A is at the origin, and IA is along the y-axis, so that OI is horizontal? Wait, since IA is perpendicular to OI, if IA is along the y-axis, then OI would be along the x-axis. Maybe that can work?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider coordinate system with point A at (0,0), and let me try to set coordinates such that IA is along the y-axis, so point I is at (0, something), and OI is along the x-axis. Hmm, maybe that could help. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using vectors? Let me see. Let me recall that in triangle geometry, there are relations between the inradius, circumradius, and the sides. Maybe using trigonometric identities?\n\nWait, let me think of the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. The vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. Let me denote coordinates for points O and I. Maybe setting up coordinates such that the circumcircle is centered at the origin? Hmm, perhaps that complicates things. Alternatively, place point A at (0,0), and set up coordinates so that calculations are manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use barycentric coordinates? Hmm, perhaps too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius r = (Area)/s, where s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R = (a b c)/(4 Area). Also, maybe the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius?\n\nWait, so OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, in this problem, that would be OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). But the problem also states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So maybe there's a relation between IA and OI?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the length IA. The distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Let me recall that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be given by:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. The inradius is related to the distances from the incenter to the vertices. Alternatively, in triangle A, the distance from I to A can be expressed using trigonometric functions. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed given by:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nYes, that formula is correct. Because in the incenter, the angle between the inradius and the angle bisector would form a right triangle where IA is the hypotenuse, and the inradius is the opposite side to angle A/2. So IA = r / sin(A/2). So that's a useful formula.\n\nSimilarly, the distance OI is given by sqrt(R(R - 2r)) as per the formula above, so OI = sqrt(13) here.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA? Wait, OI is the hypotenuse here, since IA is perpendicular to OI. Wait, actually, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle with right angle at I? Wait, no. Wait, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees, so the triangle OIA has a right angle at I? Wait, OI is the segment from O to I, and IA is from I to A, so the angle between OI and IA is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle OIA has a right angle at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras:\n\nOA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBecause in triangle OIA, right-angled at I, so OA is the hypotenuse. Since OA is the distance from circumcenter O to vertex A, which is the circumradius R = 13. Therefore:\n\nOA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 \u21d2 13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 \u21d2 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2 \u21d2 IA\u00b2 = 156 \u21d2 IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay. So IA is sqrt(156).\n\nBut we also have IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). Therefore:\n\nIA = 6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156) \u21d2 sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13? Wait, let's compute that:\n\nWait, sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, sqrt(156) = 2\u221a39. So:\n\n6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39 \u21d2 sin(A/2) = 6/(2\u221a39) = 3/\u221a39 = (3\u221a39)/39 = \u221a39/13. Wait, let me rationalize the denominator:\n\n3 / \u221a39 = (3\u221a39) / 39 = \u221a39 / 13. Yes. So sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13. Let me compute cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1. So cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. Since A is an angle in a triangle, it's between 0 and 180, so A/2 is between 0 and 90, so cos is positive.\n\nTherefore, cos(A/2) = \u221a(130)/13.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find angle A. Alternatively, perhaps express sin A in terms of sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). Since sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13) = 2*(\u221a(39*130))/169.\n\nLet me compute 39*130. 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so total 3900+1170=5070. So sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070 factors: 5070 = 10*507 = 10*3*169 = 10*3*13\u00b2. Therefore sqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*3*13\u00b2)=13*sqrt(30). Therefore sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo sin A = (2\u221a30)/13. Therefore angle A has this sine. Hmm. Okay, so sin A = 2\u221a30 /13. Let me note that down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the area of the triangle in terms of inradius and semiperimeter: Area = r*s, where s is semiperimeter. Also, Area = (a*b*c)/(4R). Since we know R and r, but we need to relate the sides.\n\nAlternatively, since we have sin A, perhaps we can use the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that a/sin A = 2R, so a = 2R sin A. Since a is the side opposite angle A, which is BC. Let me denote sides as follows: BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. Then, according to the Law of Sines:\n\na = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30 /13) = 4\u221a30. Wait, hold on: 2R sin A would be 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) ?\n\nWait, sin A is (2\u221a30)/13. So 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30)/13 = 4\u221a30. Therefore, BC = a = 4\u221a30. Hmm, okay. So that gives us side BC. So that's one side.\n\nBut we need to find AB * AC, which is c*b. Hmm. Let me see.\n\nAlso, the area of the triangle can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Since angle A is between sides b and c. So Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Also, the area is equal to r*s, where s = (a + b + c)/2. So:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = r*s = 6*( (a + b + c)/2 ) \u21d2 (b c sin A)/2 = 6*(a + b + c)/2 \u21d2 b c sin A = 6(a + b + c).\n\nWe already know sin A = 2\u221a30 /13, and a =4\u221a30, so substituting:\n\nb c*(2\u221a30 /13) = 6*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nHmm, this might be a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find another equation.\n\nAlso, from the Law of Sines, we can express sides b and c in terms of angles B and C. Let me denote angles at B and C as B and C respectively.\n\nLaw of Sines gives:\n\na/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R = 26.\n\nSo, since a =4\u221a30, then 4\u221a30 / sin A =26. Wait, but sin A was 2\u221a30 /13, so 4\u221a30 divided by (2\u221a30 /13) is (4\u221a30)*(13)/(2\u221a30)= (4*13)/2 = 26, which checks out.\n\nSo, sides b and c can be written as:\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nc = 26 sin C.\n\nAlso, since angles A + B + C = \u03c0, so B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nHmm. So maybe we can express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the formula for the inradius r = (Area)/s. Since Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A, and s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula that relates R, r, and the distance OI. Wait, but we already used that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find expressions for b and c in terms of the semiperimeter and other variables. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the coordinates of the incenter and circumradius?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another relation involving IA. Since we have IA = 2\u221a39, and IA is related to the sides. Wait, the formula for IA was IA = r / sin(A/2). We had that IA = 2\u221a39, so 2\u221a39 = 6 / sin(A/2), which led us to sin(A/2) = 3/\u221a39. Wait, but maybe there are other formulas for IA. Let me recall that in terms of the sides, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can also be given by:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( s - a \\right)^2}\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. The formula is:\n\nIA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2,\n\nwhere s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite angle A. Let me confirm this formula. \n\nYes, actually, this is a standard formula. The distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2). So that might be helpful here. \n\nGiven that, since we have IA = 2\u221a39, then:\n\nIA\u00b2 = (2\u221a39)^2 = 4*39 = 156 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 (s - a)^2 = 120 \u21d2 s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30). Since s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2. Therefore, s - a = ( -a + b + c)/2. Let me denote that as (b + c - a)/2 = sqrt(120). So,\n\n(b + c - a)/2 = 2\u221a30 \u21d2 b + c - a = 4\u221a30.\n\nWe know that a =4\u221a30, so substituting:\n\nb + c - 4\u221a30 = 4\u221a30 \u21d2 b + c = 8\u221a30.\n\nHmm, okay, so that's one equation: b + c = 8\u221a30.\n\nNow, we need another equation to relate b and c. Let's see. The semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2. Since we know that b + c = 8\u221a30, then s = (4\u221a30 +8\u221a30)/2 = (12\u221a30)/2 = 6\u221a30. Therefore, s =6\u221a30.\n\nNow, the inradius formula: Area = r*s =6 *6\u221a30 = 36\u221a30.\n\nBut also, the area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. We have sin A = 2\u221a30 /13, so:\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30)/13 = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nSetting equal to 36\u221a30:\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 = 36\u221a30 \u21d2 (b c)/13 =36 \u21d2 bc = 36*13 = 468.\n\nTherefore, the product of sides b and c is 468. Since the question asks for AB * AC. Wait, in standard notation, AB is side c, AC is side b (since side opposite angle B is AC, and side opposite angle C is AB). Wait, let me confirm the notation:\n\nIn triangle ABC, side a is BC, side b is AC, and side c is AB. So yes, AB is c, AC is b. Therefore, AB * AC = c*b = bc =468. Therefore, the answer is 468? Wait, but let me check all steps again to confirm.\n\nWait, let me recap:\n\nWe had IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2, so 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 (s -a)^2 =120 \u21d2 s -a = 2\u221a30. Then since s -a = (b + c -a)/2 = 2\u221a30 \u21d2 (b + c -a) =4\u221a30. Since a =4\u221a30, then b + c =8\u221a30. Then s = (a +b +c)/2 = (4\u221a30 +8\u221a30)/2 =6\u221a30. \n\nThen, area is r*s =6*6\u221a30 =36\u221a30. Also, area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A. We had sin A =2\u221a30/13. So plugging in:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13) = (b c \u221a30)/13 = 36\u221a30 \u21d2 bc = (36\u221a30)*(13)/\u221a30 = 36*13 = 468. \n\nTherefore, yes, that's correct. So the product AB * AC is 468. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \\boxed{468}.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I made any miscalculations here. Let's see.\n\nFirst, OI squared is R\u00b2 - 2Rr =169 - 156 =13, so OI is sqrt(13). Then, in triangle OIA right-angled at I, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 \u21d2 169 =13 + IA\u00b2 \u21d2 IA\u00b2 =156 \u21d2 IA= sqrt(156). Then using IA = r / sin(A/2):\n\nsqrt(156) =6 / sin(A/2) \u21d2 sin(A/2)=6/sqrt(156)=6/(2*sqrt(39))=3/sqrt(39)=sqrt(39)/13 (after rationalizing). Then, sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13, so cos(A/2)=sqrt(1 - (39/169))=sqrt(130/169)=sqrt(130)/13. Then sin A =2 sin(A/2)cos(A/2)=2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2*sqrt(5070)/169. Wait, but 39*130=5070, so sqrt(5070)=sqrt(13\u00b2*30)=13*sqrt(30). Therefore, sin A=2*(13*sqrt(30))/169= (26 sqrt(30))/169 = 2 sqrt(30)/13. That's correct.\n\nThen using Law of Sines: a=2R sin A =2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=4 sqrt(30). Correct. \n\nThen IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2 \u21d2156 =36 + (s -a)^2 \u21d2 s -a = sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30). Then, since s -a=(b +c -a)/2 \u21d2 (b +c -a)=4 sqrt(30). Since a=4 sqrt(30), so b +c =8 sqrt(30). \n\nSemiperimeter s=(a +b +c)/2= (4 sqrt(30)+8 sqrt(30))/2=6 sqrt(30). \n\nArea via inradius: r*s=6*6 sqrt(30)=36 sqrt(30). \n\nArea via sides: (1/2)*b*c*sin A = (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= (b c sqrt(30))/13. \n\nSetting equal: (b c sqrt(30))/13 =36 sqrt(30) \u21d2 bc= 36*13=468. \n\nAll steps check out. Therefore, the answer is 468. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this geometry problem. So, we have triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI. The circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. We need to find the product AB multiplied by AC. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling some properties and formulas related to circumcenters, incenters, and maybe some coordinate geometry.\n\nFirst, let me note down what's given:\n\n1.

The formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Yes, that's it! OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, so if that's the case, then if IA is perpendicular to OI, maybe there's a relation here?\n\nWait, but hold on. The formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr is a general formula for any triangle, right? Let me confirm. Hmm, actually, I think that formula might not be entirely accurate. Let me check again.\n\nActually, the formula for the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr\n\nYes, that's correct. I think that is the formula. So OI squared equals R squared minus twice R times r. Let me confirm this formula. For instance, in an equilateral triangle, the inradius is (a\u221a3)/6 and circumradius is (a\u221a3)/3. Then OI should be zero because both centers coincide. Plugging into the formula: R\u00b2 - 2Rr = ( (a\u221a3/3)^2 ) - 2*(a\u221a3/3)*(a\u221a3/6 ) = (a\u00b2/3) - 2*(a\u00b2/6) = (a\u00b2/3) - (a\u00b2/3) = 0. Okay, that works. So the formula seems correct.\n\nTherefore, in this problem, OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI is sqrt(13). Wait, but in the problem, we also have that IA is perpendicular to OI. Hmm, so maybe we can use some vector approach or coordinate geometry here?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use coordinate geometry by placing the triangle in a coordinate system where point A is at the origin, and IA is along the y-axis, so that OI is horizontal? Wait, since IA is perpendicular to OI, if IA is along the y-axis, then OI would be along the x-axis. Maybe that can work?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider coordinate system with point A at (0,0), and let me try to set coordinates such that IA is along the y-axis, so point I is at (0, something), and OI is along the x-axis. Hmm, maybe that could help. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using vectors? Let me see. Let me recall that in triangle geometry, there are relations between the inradius, circumradius, and the sides. Maybe using trigonometric identities?\n\nWait, let me think of the condition that IA is perpendicular to OI. The vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. Let me denote coordinates for points O and I. Maybe setting up coordinates such that the circumcircle is centered at the origin? Hmm, perhaps that complicates things. Alternatively, place point A at (0,0), and set up coordinates so that calculations are manageable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use barycentric coordinates? Hmm, perhaps too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius r = (Area)/s, where s is the semiperimeter. The circumradius R = (a b c)/(4 Area). Also, maybe the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius?\n\nWait, so OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, in this problem, that would be OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. So OI = sqrt(13). But the problem also states that IA is perpendicular to OI. So maybe there's a relation between IA and OI?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for the length IA. The distance from the incenter to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the sides and angles. Let me recall that the distance from the incenter to a vertex can be given by:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me think. The inradius is related to the distances from the incenter to the vertices. Alternatively, in triangle A, the distance from I to A can be expressed using trigonometric functions. Let me recall that in a triangle, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is indeed given by:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nYes, that formula is correct. Because in the incenter, the angle between the inradius and the angle bisector would form a right triangle where IA is the hypotenuse, and the inradius is the opposite side to angle A/2. So IA = r / sin(A/2). So that's a useful formula.\n\nSimilarly, the distance OI is given by sqrt(R(R - 2r)) as per the formula above, so OI = sqrt(13) here.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA? Wait, OI is the hypotenuse here, since IA is perpendicular to OI. Wait, actually, if IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is a right-angled triangle with right angle at I? Wait, no. Wait, the vectors IA and OI are perpendicular, so the angle between IA and OI is 90 degrees, so the triangle OIA has a right angle at I? Wait, OI is the segment from O to I, and IA is from I to A, so the angle between OI and IA is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle OIA has a right angle at I. Therefore, by Pythagoras:\n\nOA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2.\n\nBecause in triangle OIA, right-angled at I, so OA is the hypotenuse. Since OA is the distance from circumcenter O to vertex A, which is the circumradius R = 13. Therefore:\n\nOA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 \u21d2 13\u00b2 = (sqrt(13))\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 \u21d2 169 = 13 + IA\u00b2 \u21d2 IA\u00b2 = 156 \u21d2 IA = sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Hmm, okay. So IA is sqrt(156).\n\nBut we also have IA = r / sin(A/2) = 6 / sin(A/2). Therefore:\n\nIA = 6 / sin(A/2) = sqrt(156) \u21d2 sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13? Wait, let's compute that:\n\nWait, sqrt(156) = sqrt(4*39) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore, sqrt(156) = 2\u221a39. So:\n\n6 / sin(A/2) = 2\u221a39 \u21d2 sin(A/2) = 6/(2\u221a39) = 3/\u221a39 = (3\u221a39)/39 = \u221a39/13. Wait, let me rationalize the denominator:\n\n3 / \u221a39 = (3\u221a39) / 39 = \u221a39 / 13. Yes. So sin(A/2) = \u221a39 / 13.\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) = \u221a39 /13. Let me compute cos(A/2) using the identity sin\u00b2\u03b8 + cos\u00b2\u03b8 =1. So cos\u00b2(A/2) = 1 - (39/169) = (169 - 39)/169 = 130/169. Therefore, cos(A/2) = sqrt(130)/13. Since A is an angle in a triangle, it's between 0 and 180, so A/2 is between 0 and 90, so cos is positive.\n\nTherefore, cos(A/2) = \u221a(130)/13.\n\nNow, perhaps we can find angle A. Alternatively, perhaps express sin A in terms of sin(A/2) and cos(A/2). Since sin A = 2 sin(A/2) cos(A/2) = 2*(\u221a39/13)*(\u221a130/13) = 2*(\u221a(39*130))/169.\n\nLet me compute 39*130. 39*100=3900, 39*30=1170, so total 3900+1170=5070. So sqrt(5070). Hmm, 5070 factors: 5070 = 10*507 = 10*3*169 = 10*3*13\u00b2. Therefore sqrt(5070)=sqrt(10*3*13\u00b2)=13*sqrt(30). Therefore sin A = 2*(13*sqrt(30))/169 = (26 sqrt(30))/169 = (2 sqrt(30))/13.\n\nSo sin A = (2\u221a30)/13. Therefore angle A has this sine. Hmm. Okay, so sin A = 2\u221a30 /13. Let me note that down.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use the formula for the area of the triangle in terms of inradius and semiperimeter: Area = r*s, where s is semiperimeter. Also, Area = (a*b*c)/(4R). Since we know R and r, but we need to relate the sides.\n\nAlternatively, since we have sin A, perhaps we can use the Law of Sines. The Law of Sines states that a/sin A = 2R, so a = 2R sin A. Since a is the side opposite angle A, which is BC. Let me denote sides as follows: BC = a, AC = b, AB = c. Then, according to the Law of Sines:\n\na = 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30 /13) = 4\u221a30. Wait, hold on: 2R sin A would be 2*13*(2\u221a30/13) ?\n\nWait, sin A is (2\u221a30)/13. So 2R sin A = 2*13*(2\u221a30)/13 = 4\u221a30. Therefore, BC = a = 4\u221a30. Hmm, okay. So that gives us side BC. So that's one side.\n\nBut we need to find AB * AC, which is c*b. Hmm. Let me see.\n\nAlso, the area of the triangle can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Since angle A is between sides b and c. So Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A. Also, the area is equal to r*s, where s = (a + b + c)/2. So:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = r*s = 6*( (a + b + c)/2 ) \u21d2 (b c sin A)/2 = 6*(a + b + c)/2 \u21d2 b c sin A = 6(a + b + c).\n\nWe already know sin A = 2\u221a30 /13, and a =4\u221a30, so substituting:\n\nb c*(2\u221a30 /13) = 6*(4\u221a30 + b + c).\n\nHmm, this might be a bit complicated, but perhaps we can find another equation.\n\nAlso, from the Law of Sines, we can express sides b and c in terms of angles B and C. Let me denote angles at B and C as B and C respectively.\n\nLaw of Sines gives:\n\na/sin A = b/sin B = c/sin C = 2R = 26.\n\nSo, since a =4\u221a30, then 4\u221a30 / sin A =26. Wait, but sin A was 2\u221a30 /13, so 4\u221a30 divided by (2\u221a30 /13) is (4\u221a30)*(13)/(2\u221a30)= (4*13)/2 = 26, which checks out.\n\nSo, sides b and c can be written as:\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nc = 26 sin C.\n\nAlso, since angles A + B + C = \u03c0, so B + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nHmm. So maybe we can express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A?\n\nAlternatively, maybe use the formula for the inradius r = (Area)/s. Since Area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A, and s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula that relates R, r, and the distance OI. Wait, but we already used that. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find expressions for b and c in terms of the semiperimeter and other variables. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the coordinates of the incenter and circumradius?\n\nAlternatively, let me see if there's another relation involving IA. Since we have IA = 2\u221a39, and IA is related to the sides. Wait, the formula for IA was IA = r / sin(A/2). We had that IA = 2\u221a39, so 2\u221a39 = 6 / sin(A/2), which led us to sin(A/2) = 3/\u221a39. Wait, but maybe there are other formulas for IA. Let me recall that in terms of the sides, the distance from the incenter to vertex A can also be given by:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( s - a \\right)^2}\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me recall the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex. The formula is:\n\nIA^2 = r^2 + (s - a)^2,\n\nwhere s is the semiperimeter, and a is the side opposite angle A. Let me confirm this formula. \n\nYes, actually, this is a standard formula. The distance from the incenter to vertex A is sqrt(r\u00b2 + (s - a)\u00b2). So that might be helpful here. \n\nGiven that, since we have IA = 2\u221a39, then:\n\nIA\u00b2 = (2\u221a39)^2 = 4*39 = 156 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 156 = 6\u00b2 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 (s - a)^2 = 120 \u21d2 s - a = sqrt(120) = 2*sqrt(30). Since s is the semiperimeter, s = (a + b + c)/2. Therefore, s - a = ( -a + b + c)/2. Let me denote that as (b + c - a)/2 = sqrt(120). So,\n\n(b + c - a)/2 = 2\u221a30 \u21d2 b + c - a = 4\u221a30.\n\nWe know that a =4\u221a30, so substituting:\n\nb + c - 4\u221a30 = 4\u221a30 \u21d2 b + c = 8\u221a30.\n\nHmm, okay, so that's one equation: b + c = 8\u221a30.\n\nNow, we need another equation to relate b and c. Let's see. The semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2. Since we know that b + c = 8\u221a30, then s = (4\u221a30 +8\u221a30)/2 = (12\u221a30)/2 = 6\u221a30. Therefore, s =6\u221a30.\n\nNow, the inradius formula: Area = r*s =6 *6\u221a30 = 36\u221a30.\n\nBut also, the area can be expressed as (1/2)*b*c*sin A. We have sin A = 2\u221a30 /13, so:\n\nArea = (1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30)/13 = (b c \u221a30)/13.\n\nSetting equal to 36\u221a30:\n\n(b c \u221a30)/13 = 36\u221a30 \u21d2 (b c)/13 =36 \u21d2 bc = 36*13 = 468.\n\nTherefore, the product of sides b and c is 468. Since the question asks for AB * AC. Wait, in standard notation, AB is side c, AC is side b (since side opposite angle B is AC, and side opposite angle C is AB). Wait, let me confirm the notation:\n\nIn triangle ABC, side a is BC, side b is AC, and side c is AB. So yes, AB is c, AC is b. Therefore, AB * AC = c*b = bc =468. Therefore, the answer is 468? Wait, but let me check all steps again to confirm.\n\nWait, let me recap:\n\nWe had IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s - a)^2, so 156 = 36 + (s - a)^2 \u21d2 (s -a)^2 =120 \u21d2 s -a = 2\u221a30. Then since s -a = (b + c -a)/2 = 2\u221a30 \u21d2 (b + c -a) =4\u221a30. Since a =4\u221a30, then b + c =8\u221a30. Then s = (a +b +c)/2 = (4\u221a30 +8\u221a30)/2 =6\u221a30. \n\nThen, area is r*s =6*6\u221a30 =36\u221a30. Also, area is (1/2)*b*c*sin A. We had sin A =2\u221a30/13. So plugging in:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13) = (b c \u221a30)/13 = 36\u221a30 \u21d2 bc = (36\u221a30)*(13)/\u221a30 = 36*13 = 468. \n\nTherefore, yes, that's correct. So the product AB * AC is 468. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be \\boxed{468}.\n\nWait, but let me just check if I made any miscalculations here. Let's see.\n\nFirst, OI squared is R\u00b2 - 2Rr =169 - 156 =13, so OI is sqrt(13). Then, in triangle OIA right-angled at I, OA\u00b2 = OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 \u21d2 169 =13 + IA\u00b2 \u21d2 IA\u00b2 =156 \u21d2 IA= sqrt(156). Then using IA = r / sin(A/2):\n\nsqrt(156) =6 / sin(A/2) \u21d2 sin(A/2)=6/sqrt(156)=6/(2*sqrt(39))=3/sqrt(39)=sqrt(39)/13 (after rationalizing). Then, sin(A/2)=sqrt(39)/13, so cos(A/2)=sqrt(1 - (39/169))=sqrt(130/169)=sqrt(130)/13. Then sin A =2 sin(A/2)cos(A/2)=2*(sqrt(39)/13)*(sqrt(130)/13)=2*sqrt(5070)/169. Wait, but 39*130=5070, so sqrt(5070)=sqrt(13\u00b2*30)=13*sqrt(30). Therefore, sin A=2*(13*sqrt(30))/169= (26 sqrt(30))/169 = 2 sqrt(30)/13. That's correct.\n\nThen using Law of Sines: a=2R sin A =2*13*(2 sqrt(30)/13)=4 sqrt(30). Correct. \n\nThen IA\u00b2 = r\u00b2 + (s -a)^2 \u21d2156 =36 + (s -a)^2 \u21d2 s -a = sqrt(120)=2*sqrt(30). Then, since s -a=(b +c -a)/2 \u21d2 (b +c -a)=4 sqrt(30). Since a=4 sqrt(30), so b +c =8 sqrt(30). \n\nSemiperimeter s=(a +b +c)/2= (4 sqrt(30)+8 sqrt(30))/2=6 sqrt(30). \n\nArea via inradius: r*s=6*6 sqrt(30)=36 sqrt(30). \n\nArea via sides: (1/2)*b*c*sin A = (1/2)*b*c*(2 sqrt(30)/13)= (b c sqrt(30))/13. \n\nSetting equal: (b c sqrt(30))/13 =36 sqrt(30) \u21d2 bc= 36*13=468. \n\nAll steps check out. Therefore, the answer is 468. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with circumcenter \\( O \\) and incenter \\( I \\), where \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), and inradius \\( r = 6 \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product of AB and AC. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of circumcenters and incenters. The circumradius R is given as 13, so the distance from the circumcenter O to any vertex (like A, B, or C) is 13. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the incircle tangent to all three sides. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nThe key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here, or perhaps there's a formula that relates these elements. Let me see.\n\nI remember there's a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. The formula is: \n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r cos A)\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's exactly correct. Maybe I need to check the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius. Alternatively, maybe there's another relation.\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA. Let me think. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is right-angled at A. Wait, no, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I? Wait, no, the line segments IA and OI are perpendicular. So the angle between them is 90 degrees. So actually, the triangle OIA has a right angle at A? Wait, no, because IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is the segment from O to I. The two lines IA and OI are perpendicular. So the angle between OI and IA is 90 degrees. So that would mean that the triangle OIA is right-angled at the point where they meet. Wait, IA is from I to A, and OI is from O to I. So the angle between OI and IA is at point I. Wait, so the angle at I between OI and IA is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle OIA is right-angled at I.\n\nAh, that's better. So triangle OIA is right-angled at I. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nOI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13, so OA = 13. Therefore:\n\nOI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169\n\nBut we need expressions for OI and IA. Let me see if I can relate these to other known quantities.\n\nI know the inradius is 6, but how does that relate to IA?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall formulas involving the distance between incenter and circumradius. There is a formula that relates OI, R, and r. Let me recall:\n\nIn any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. Hmm, actually, I think that formula might be under certain conditions. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for OI\u00b2 is:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr\n\nWait, let me confirm. Hmm, actually, I think the correct formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me see if that's the case. Wait, actually, I might be mixing it up. Maybe it's OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr cos A or something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to derive it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me try setting up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place the triangle such that point A is at the origin, and the line IA is along the y-axis, since IA is perpendicular to OI, so OI would be along the x-axis? Hmm, maybe that's a good idea.\n\nWait, let me try to think of coordinates. Let me set point A at (0,0). Let me let the incenter I be at (0, something) since IA is along the y-axis. Wait, but IA is perpendicular to OI, so if IA is along the y-axis, then OI must be along the x-axis. So point O would lie somewhere along the x-axis, say (h, 0). The incenter I is along the y-axis, say (0, k). Then, since IA is the line from I (0,k) to A (0,0), which is along the y-axis, and OI is the line from O (h,0) to I (0,k). The slope of OI is (k - 0)/(0 - h) = -k/h. The slope of IA is undefined (vertical line). Wait, but IA is perpendicular to OI. For two lines to be perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1. But IA is vertical, so OI must be horizontal? Wait, but in this coordinate system, OI is from (h,0) to (0,k), so unless k=0, which would make OI horizontal, but then IA is vertical. Wait, if OI is horizontal, then k must be 0, but then the inradius center would be on the x-axis, but the inradius is 6, so maybe?\n\nHmm, maybe this coordinate approach is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is right-angled at I, so OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2. We know OA is 13, so OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 169.\n\nWe need to express OI and IA in terms of known quantities.\n\nWe know the inradius r is 6, so IA is the distance from inradius to vertex A, which can be related to the sides of the triangle.\n\nWait, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by the formula:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 } ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me recall the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex.\n\nThe distance from the incenter I to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle and the angles. Alternatively, using trigonometric relations.\n\nThe formula for IA is:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}\n\nYes, I think that's correct. Let me verify.\n\nIn triangle A, the inradius r is related to the distances from the incenter to the vertices. Let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, but the distance from the incenter to the vertex can be found using trigonometric functions.\n\nIn the incenter, the distance from I to vertex A is indeed given by IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nSimilarly, IB = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{B}{2}}, and IC = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{C}{2}}.\n\nYes, that seems right. Because if you consider the angle bisector, and the inradius is the distance to the side, so in the right triangle formed by the inradius, the angle at I is A/2, so opposite side is r, hypotenuse is IA, so sin(A/2) = r / IA => IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nOkay, so IA = r / sin(A/2). Since r is 6, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, the distance OI can be expressed via the formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr cos A?\n\nWait, I think there is a formula for OI in terms of R, r, and angles. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. But that might be only in certain cases. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nWait, let me look up the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius. Wait, since I can't actually look it up, I need to recall.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vector coordinates. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, in Eulidean geometry, the distance between incenter and circumcenter is given by OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, but I think that formula is only valid for certain cases? Wait, actually, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, Euler's formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Hmm, that's possible. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So that's a general formula for any triangle. So OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So here R is 13, so OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Wait, but in our case, we have triangle OIA being right-angled at I, so OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2. So substituting OI\u00b2 from Euler's formula into that equation.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me note that Euler's formula says OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So substituting into the equation from the right angle at I:\n\n(OI)^2 + (IA)^2 = OA^2\n\n=> (R\u00b2 - 2Rr) + (IA)^2 = R\u00b2\n\nTherefore, (IA)^2 = 2Rr\n\nSo IA^2 = 2 * R * r = 2 *13*6 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). But also, from the other formula, IA = r / sin(A/2). Therefore:\n\nsqrt(156) = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nSo sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) ) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13 ?\n\nWait, let me compute that again:\n\nsqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39) which is 2*sqrt(39). So sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore,\n\nIA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore,\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39)\n\nSimplify that:\n\n3 / sqrt(39) = (3 sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, sqrt(39) is sqrt(13*3), so sqrt(39)/13 is sqrt(3)/sqrt(13). Hmm, maybe better to keep it as 3/sqrt(39).\n\nBut perhaps rationalizing the denominator:\n\n3 / sqrt(39) = 3 sqrt(39) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me note that down.\n\nSo sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Let me see if I can find angle A from this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find cos A using double angle formula.\n\nSince sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13,\n\nthen cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) ?\n\nWait, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2). Let me verify:\n\nYes, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2). So let's compute that:\n\nsin\u00b2(A/2) = (39)/169,\n\nso cos A = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / 13\u00b2 = 7/13.\n\nTherefore, cos A = 7/13.\n\nOkay, so angle A has cosine 7/13. That might be useful.\n\nNow, perhaps I can relate this to the sides of the triangle. Let me recall the formula involving the circumradius.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the Law of Cosines says that:\n\nBC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 - 2 AB * AC cos A.\n\nAlso, the Law of Sines says that AB = 2R sin C, AC = 2R sin B, and BC = 2R sin A.\n\nSince R =13, so AB = 26 sin C, AC = 26 sin B, BC = 26 sin A.\n\nMoreover, in any triangle, A + B + C = \u03c0.\n\nAlso, the inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter: r = area / s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThe area can also be expressed as (AB * AC * sin A)/2.\n\nAlternatively, since we know cos A, we can find sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express the sides in terms of angles, then use the inradius formula.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote AB = c, AC = b, BC = a.\n\nThen, according to the Law of Sines:\n\na = 2R sin A = 26 sin A,\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nc = 26 sin C.\n\nWe also know that cos A = 7/13, so sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nTherefore, a = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, 26 divided by 13 is 2, so yes, 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30). Hmm, okay.\n\nSo BC = a = 4\u221a30.\n\nNow, let's think about the inradius formula. The inradius r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nSo area = r*s = 6*s.\n\nAlso, area can be written as (1/2)*AB*AC*sin A = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo (1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s.\n\nWe need to find AB * AC, which is b*c. Let me denote x = b*c. Then,\n\n(1/2)*x*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 6*s.\n\nHmm, so (x * sqrt(30)) /13 = 6s.\n\nBut I need another relation involving s and the sides.\n\nThe semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nBut I also know from the Law of Sines that:\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nc = 26 sin C,\n\nand since A + B + C = \u03c0,\n\nB + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can use some trigonometric identities here.\n\nAlternatively, since we know angle A, maybe express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in triangle ABC,\n\nsin B / b = sin C / c = 1/(2R) = 1/26.\n\nWait, Law of Sines says a/sin A = 2R, so sin A = a/(2R). Wait, but we already used that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the inradius in terms of angles. Wait, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nand the area is 6*s,\n\nand also area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A,\n\nso setting them equal:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s,\n\nso (b c sin A)/12 = s,\n\nbut s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nso:\n\n(b c sin A)/12 = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nMultiply both sides by 12:\n\nb c sin A = 6(a + b + c)\n\nHmm, so that's an equation involving b, c, and a. Since a is already known as 4\u221a30,\n\nand b and c are related via the Law of Sines.\n\nLet me denote angle B and angle C.\n\nWe have angle A known, so angle B + angle C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nAlso, from Law of Sines,\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nc = 26 sin C,\n\nand since angle C = \u03c0 - A - B,\n\nso sin C = sin(\u03c0 - A - B) = sin(A + B).\n\nWait, sin(\u03c0 - x) = sin x, so sin(\u03c0 - A - B) = sin(A + B). Hmm, but angle C = \u03c0 - A - B, so sin C = sin(A + B). Hmm, but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that angle B + angle C = \u03c0 - A,\n\nso let me set angle B = \u03b8, then angle C = \u03c0 - A - \u03b8.\n\nTherefore,\n\nb = 26 sin \u03b8,\n\nc = 26 sin(\u03c0 - A - \u03b8) = 26 sin(A + \u03b8).\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the inradius in terms of the sides:\n\nr = (a + b - c)/2 * tan(A/2) ?\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, let me recall that inradius r = (area)/(semiperimeter),\n\nand area can also be written as r*s, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula that relates R, r, and the angles. Wait, Euler's formula gave us a relation here, but we might need another relation.\n\nAlternatively, since we have angle A, perhaps we can express the sides in terms of angle B and C, but this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in triangle ABC,\n\nusing the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A,\n\nand since we know a = 4\u221a30,\n\nand cos A =7/13,\n\nso let's plug that in:\n\n(4\u221a30)^2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13)\n\nCalculating left side: 16*30 = 480,\n\nso:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, okay. So that's one equation involving b and c.\n\nWe also have from the area expressions:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s,\n\nwhere s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nWe know sin A = 2\u221a30 /13,\n\nso substituting:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13) = 6*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 )\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n( b c \u221a30 ) /13 = 6*(4\u221a30 + b + c)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\nb c \u221a30 = 6*13*(4\u221a30 + b + c)/2\n\nSimplify right side:\n\n6*13/2 = 39,\n\nso:\n\nb c \u221a30 = 39*(4\u221a30 + b + c)\n\nHmm, so:\n\nb c \u221a30 = 39*4\u221a30 + 39b + 39c\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nLeft side: b c \u221a30,\n\nRight side: 156\u221a30 + 39b + 39c\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nb c \u221a30 - 39b - 39c = 156\u221a30\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe we can find a substitution here. Let me denote x = b and y = c, so:\n\nx y \u221a30 - 39x - 39y = 156\u221a30\n\nHmm. Also from the Law of Cosines equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (14/13)xy = 480\n\nHmm, so two equations with two variables x and y. This might be solvable, but it's going to be a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter approach here. Let me think again.\n\nWe need to find AB * AC, which is b*c. Let me denote that as K = b*c. Our goal is to find K.\n\nLooking back at the equation from the area:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s,\n\nand s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nso substituting,\n\n(1/2)*K*(2\u221a30 /13) = 6*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 )\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n( K * \u221a30 ) /13 = 3*(4\u221a30 + b + c )\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, (1/2)*K*(2\u221a30 /13) = (K * \u221a30)/13,\n\nand right side is 6*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 ) = 3*(4\u221a30 + b + c )\n\nTherefore:\n\n(K * \u221a30)/13 = 3*(4\u221a30 + b + c )\n\nHmm, so rearranged:\n\nK * \u221a30 = 39*(4\u221a30 + b + c )\n\nHmm, similar to before. Let me see if I can express b + c in terms of K and other variables.\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (14/13)xy = 480,\n\nwhere x = b, y = c.\n\nWe can write x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy,\n\nso substituting,\n\n(x + y)^2 - 2xy - (14/13)xy = 480,\n\nso,\n\n(x + y)^2 - (2 + 14/13)xy = 480,\n\nCompute 2 + 14/13 = 26/13 +14/13 = 40/13,\n\nThus,\n\n(x + y)^2 - (40/13)xy = 480,\n\nLet me denote S = x + y, and P = xy = K,\n\nso,\n\nS\u00b2 - (40/13) P = 480.\n\nAlso, from the area equation above,\n\nK * \u221a30 = 39*(4\u221a30 + S )\n\nSo let's write that as:\n\nK * \u221a30 = 156\u221a30 + 39 S,\n\nthen,\n\nK * \u221a30 - 39 S = 156\u221a30,\n\nLet me write this as equation (1):\n\n\u221a30 K - 39 S = 156\u221a30,\n\nand equation (2):\n\nS\u00b2 - (40/13) K = 480.\n\nSo now, we have two equations with variables S and K. Let's try to solve them.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n\u221a30 K = 156\u221a30 + 39 S,\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a30:\n\nK = 156 + (39 / \u221a30) S,\n\nHmm, but maybe better to express S in terms of K, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, let's rearrange equation (1):\n\n\u221a30 K - 39 S = 156\u221a30,\n\nLet me solve for S:\n\n39 S = \u221a30 K - 156\u221a30,\n\nso,\n\nS = (\u221a30 / 39) K - (156\u221a30)/39,\n\nSimplify:\n\nS = (\u221a30 / 39) K - 4\u221a30,\n\nSo S = (\u221a30 / 39) (K - 156),\n\nHmm, okay. Let me plug this into equation (2):\n\nS\u00b2 - (40/13) K = 480.\n\nSubstitute S:\n\n[ (\u221a30 / 39 (K - 156) ) ]\u00b2 - (40/13) K = 480.\n\nThis looks complicated, but let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute S squared term:\n\n[ (\u221a30 / 39 (K - 156) ) ]\u00b2 = (30)/(39\u00b2) (K - 156)^2\n\nSo,\n\n30/(39\u00b2) (K - 156)^2 - (40/13) K = 480\n\nLet me compute 39 squared: 39\u00b2 = 1521,\n\nso,\n\n30/(1521) (K - 156)^2 - (40/13) K = 480,\n\nLet me write all terms over a common denominator, perhaps 1521.\n\nFirst term is 30/(1521)*(K - 156)^2,\n\nSecond term: - (40/13) K = - (40*117)/1521 * K, since 13*117=1521,\n\nWait 13*117 is 1521? Let me check: 13*100=1300, 13*17=221, so total 1521, yes.\n\nSo, 40/13 = (40*117)/1521,\n\nTherefore,\n\nSecond term is - (40*117)/1521 * K,\n\nThird term is 480 = 480*1521 /1521,\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n[30(K - 156)^2 - 40*117 K + 480*(-1521)] / 1521 = 0,\n\nWait, actually, moving 480 to the left side,\n\nthe equation is:\n\n30/(1521)*(K - 156)^2 - (40/13) K - 480 = 0,\n\nSo multiplying all terms by 1521,\n\n30(K - 156)^2 - 40*117 K - 480*1521 = 0,\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 30(K\u00b2 - 312 K + 156\u00b2),\n\nSecond term: -40*117 K,\n\nThird term: -480*1521,\n\nLet me compute constants:\n\nFirst term:\n\n30K\u00b2 - 30*312 K + 30*(156)^2,\n\nSecond term:\n\n- 40*117 K = -4680 K,\n\nThird term:\n\n-480*1521 = let's compute that: 480*1500=720,000, 480*21=10,080, so total 720,000 +10,080=730,080, so with the negative: -730,080.\n\nPutting all together:\n\n30K\u00b2 - 30*312 K + 30*(156)^2 -4680 K -730,080 = 0,\n\nCompute each coefficient:\n\nFirst term: 30K\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: -30*312 K = -9360 K,\n\nThird term: 30*(156)^2,\n\nLet me compute 156 squared: 156*156,\n\n156*156: 150\u00b2 + 2*150*6 +6\u00b2 = 22500 + 1800 +36= 24336,\n\nSo 30*24336 = 730,080.\n\nFourth term: -4680 K,\n\nFifth term: -730,080.\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\n30K\u00b2 -9360 K +730,080 -4680 K -730,080 = 0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n30K\u00b2 - (9360 +4680)K + (730,080 -730,080) = 0,\n\nSo,\n\n30K\u00b2 -14,040 K = 0,\n\nFactor:\n\n30K(K - 468) =0,\n\nThus, K =0 or K =468.\n\nSince K = b*c, which is a product of sides, it can't be zero, so K=468.\n\nTherefore, the product AB*AC is 468.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify if that makes sense.\n\nWait, so plugging back in, K=468,\n\nthen from equation (1):\n\n\u221a30 *468 - 39 S =156\u221a30,\n\nSo,\n\n\u221a30*(468 -156) = 39 S,\n\n\u221a30*(312) =39 S,\n\nTherefore,\n\nS = (312 /39)*\u221a30 = 8*\u221a30,\n\nSo S =8\u221a30,\n\nWhich is the sum of sides b + c =8\u221a30,\n\nAlso, from equation (2):\n\nS\u00b2 - (40/13)*468 =480,\n\nCompute S squared: (8\u221a30)^2 =64*30=1920,\n\n(40/13)*468= (40)*(468/13)=40*36=1440,\n\nTherefore,\n\n1920 -1440 =480,\n\nWhich matches the equation. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 468.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense in the context of the problem. Let me see:\n\nGiven that the inradius is 6 and the circumradius is 13, and angle A has cos 7/13, so angle A is acute. The product of AB and AC is 468. Let me see if with sides b and c such that b*c=468 and b +c =8\u221a30. Let me see what numbers would satisfy that.\n\nSuppose b and c are the roots of the equation x\u00b2 - (8\u221a30)x +468 =0,\n\nDiscriminant D= (8\u221a30)^2 -4*1*468 = 64*30 -1872= 1920 -1872=48,\n\nSo sqrt(D)=sqrt(48)=4*sqrt(3),\n\nThus,\n\nx=(8\u221a30 \u00b14\u221a3)/2=4\u221a30 \u00b12\u221a3,\n\nTherefore, sides are 4\u221a30 +2\u221a3 and 4\u221a30 -2\u221a3,\n\nHmm, that seems plausible. The sides would be positive since 4\u221a30 is about 4*5.477\u224821.9, and 2\u221a3\u22483.464, so both sides are positive. So that works.\n\nTherefore, the product AB*AC=468.\n\nThus, the answer is 468.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about triangle ABC with circumcenter O and incenter I. The problem states that IA is perpendicular to OI, the circumradius is 13, and the inradius is 6. I need to find the product of AB and AC. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of circumcenters and incenters. The circumradius R is given as 13, so the distance from the circumcenter O to any vertex (like A, B, or C) is 13. The inradius r is 6, which is the radius of the incircle tangent to all three sides. The incenter I is the intersection of the angle bisectors.\n\nThe key condition here is that IA is perpendicular to OI. That seems important. Maybe I can use some coordinate geometry here, or perhaps there's a formula that relates these elements. Let me see.\n\nI remember there's a formula that relates the distance between the incenter and circumcenter. The formula is: \n\nOI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r cos A)\n\nWait, but I'm not sure if that's exactly correct. Maybe I need to check the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius. Alternatively, maybe there's another relation.\n\nAlternatively, since IA is perpendicular to OI, perhaps we can use the Pythagorean theorem in triangle OIA. Let me think. If IA is perpendicular to OI, then triangle OIA is right-angled at A. Wait, no, IA is perpendicular to OI, so the right angle is at I? Wait, no, the line segments IA and OI are perpendicular. So the angle between them is 90 degrees. So actually, the triangle OIA has a right angle at A? Wait, no, because IA is a segment from I to A, and OI is the segment from O to I. The two lines IA and OI are perpendicular. So the angle between OI and IA is 90 degrees. So that would mean that the triangle OIA is right-angled at the point where they meet. Wait, IA is from I to A, and OI is from O to I. So the angle between OI and IA is at point I. Wait, so the angle at I between OI and IA is 90 degrees. Therefore, triangle OIA is right-angled at I.\n\nAh, that's better. So triangle OIA is right-angled at I. Therefore, by the Pythagorean theorem:\n\nOI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2\n\nBut OA is the circumradius, which is 13, so OA = 13. Therefore:\n\nOI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 = 169\n\nBut we need expressions for OI and IA. Let me see if I can relate these to other known quantities.\n\nI know the inradius is 6, but how does that relate to IA?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to recall formulas involving the distance between incenter and circumradius. There is a formula that relates OI, R, and r. Let me recall:\n\nIn any triangle, the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is given by OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr\n\nWait, is that correct? Let me check. Hmm, actually, I think that formula might be under certain conditions. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for OI\u00b2 is:\n\nOI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr\n\nWait, let me confirm. Hmm, actually, I think the correct formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Let me see if that's the case. Wait, actually, I might be mixing it up. Maybe it's OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr cos A or something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to derive it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use coordinates. Let me try setting up a coordinate system.\n\nLet me place the triangle such that point A is at the origin, and the line IA is along the y-axis, since IA is perpendicular to OI, so OI would be along the x-axis? Hmm, maybe that's a good idea.\n\nWait, let me try to think of coordinates. Let me set point A at (0,0). Let me let the incenter I be at (0, something) since IA is along the y-axis. Wait, but IA is perpendicular to OI, so if IA is along the y-axis, then OI must be along the x-axis. So point O would lie somewhere along the x-axis, say (h, 0). The incenter I is along the y-axis, say (0, k). Then, since IA is the line from I (0,k) to A (0,0), which is along the y-axis, and OI is the line from O (h,0) to I (0,k). The slope of OI is (k - 0)/(0 - h) = -k/h. The slope of IA is undefined (vertical line). Wait, but IA is perpendicular to OI. For two lines to be perpendicular, their slopes multiply to -1. But IA is vertical, so OI must be horizontal? Wait, but in this coordinate system, OI is from (h,0) to (0,k), so unless k=0, which would make OI horizontal, but then IA is vertical. Wait, if OI is horizontal, then k must be 0, but then the inradius center would be on the x-axis, but the inradius is 6, so maybe?\n\nHmm, maybe this coordinate approach is getting a bit tangled. Let me think again.\n\nSince IA is perpendicular to OI, triangle OIA is right-angled at I, so OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2. We know OA is 13, so OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = 169.\n\nWe need to express OI and IA in terms of known quantities.\n\nWe know the inradius r is 6, so IA is the distance from inradius to vertex A, which can be related to the sides of the triangle.\n\nWait, the distance from the incenter to vertex A is given by the formula:\n\nIA = \\sqrt{r^2 + \\left( \\frac{a}{2} \\right)^2 } ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Let me recall the formula for the distance from the incenter to a vertex.\n\nThe distance from the incenter I to vertex A can be expressed in terms of the sides of the triangle and the angles. Alternatively, using trigonometric relations.\n\nThe formula for IA is:\n\nIA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}\n\nYes, I think that's correct. Let me verify.\n\nIn triangle A, the inradius r is related to the distances from the incenter to the vertices. Let me recall that in a triangle, the inradius is the distance from the incenter to any side, but the distance from the incenter to the vertex can be found using trigonometric functions.\n\nIn the incenter, the distance from I to vertex A is indeed given by IA = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{A}{2}}.\n\nSimilarly, IB = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{B}{2}}, and IC = \\frac{r}{\\sin \\frac{C}{2}}.\n\nYes, that seems right. Because if you consider the angle bisector, and the inradius is the distance to the side, so in the right triangle formed by the inradius, the angle at I is A/2, so opposite side is r, hypotenuse is IA, so sin(A/2) = r / IA => IA = r / sin(A/2).\n\nOkay, so IA = r / sin(A/2). Since r is 6, IA = 6 / sin(A/2).\n\nSimilarly, the distance OI can be expressed via the formula OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr cos A?\n\nWait, I think there is a formula for OI in terms of R, r, and angles. Let me check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. But that might be only in certain cases. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr.\n\nWait, let me look up the formula for the distance between incenter and circumradius. Wait, since I can't actually look it up, I need to recall.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using vector coordinates. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, in Eulidean geometry, the distance between incenter and circumcenter is given by OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, but I think that formula is only valid for certain cases? Wait, actually, Euler's formula states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R(R - 2r). So OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Wait, Euler's formula is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. Hmm, that's possible. Let me confirm.\n\nYes, Euler's formula in triangle geometry states that the distance between the incenter and circumcenter is OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So that's a general formula for any triangle. So OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So here R is 13, so OI\u00b2 = 13\u00b2 - 2*13*6 = 169 - 156 = 13. Wait, but in our case, we have triangle OIA being right-angled at I, so OI\u00b2 + IA\u00b2 = OA\u00b2. So substituting OI\u00b2 from Euler's formula into that equation.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me note that Euler's formula says OI\u00b2 = R\u00b2 - 2Rr. So substituting into the equation from the right angle at I:\n\n(OI)^2 + (IA)^2 = OA^2\n\n=> (R\u00b2 - 2Rr) + (IA)^2 = R\u00b2\n\nTherefore, (IA)^2 = 2Rr\n\nSo IA^2 = 2 * R * r = 2 *13*6 = 156. Therefore, IA = sqrt(156). But also, from the other formula, IA = r / sin(A/2). Therefore:\n\nsqrt(156) = 6 / sin(A/2)\n\nSo sin(A/2) = 6 / sqrt(156) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) ) = 3 / sqrt(39) = sqrt(39)/13 ?\n\nWait, let me compute that again:\n\nsqrt(156) is sqrt(4*39) which is 2*sqrt(39). So sqrt(156) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore,\n\nIA = 6 / sin(A/2) = 2*sqrt(39). Therefore,\n\nsin(A/2) = 6 / (2*sqrt(39)) = 3 / sqrt(39)\n\nSimplify that:\n\n3 / sqrt(39) = (3 sqrt(39)) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13. Wait, sqrt(39) is sqrt(13*3), so sqrt(39)/13 is sqrt(3)/sqrt(13). Hmm, maybe better to keep it as 3/sqrt(39).\n\nBut perhaps rationalizing the denominator:\n\n3 / sqrt(39) = 3 sqrt(39) / 39 = sqrt(39)/13. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me note that down.\n\nSo sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13. Let me see if I can find angle A from this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find cos A using double angle formula.\n\nSince sin(A/2) = sqrt(39)/13,\n\nthen cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2) ?\n\nWait, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2). Let me verify:\n\nYes, cos A = 1 - 2 sin\u00b2(A/2). So let's compute that:\n\nsin\u00b2(A/2) = (39)/169,\n\nso cos A = 1 - 2*(39/169) = 1 - 78/169 = (169 - 78)/169 = 91/169 = 7*13 / 13\u00b2 = 7/13.\n\nTherefore, cos A = 7/13.\n\nOkay, so angle A has cosine 7/13. That might be useful.\n\nNow, perhaps I can relate this to the sides of the triangle. Let me recall the formula involving the circumradius.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the Law of Cosines says that:\n\nBC\u00b2 = AB\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 - 2 AB * AC cos A.\n\nAlso, the Law of Sines says that AB = 2R sin C, AC = 2R sin B, and BC = 2R sin A.\n\nSince R =13, so AB = 26 sin C, AC = 26 sin B, BC = 26 sin A.\n\nMoreover, in any triangle, A + B + C = \u03c0.\n\nAlso, the inradius r is related to the area and semiperimeter: r = area / s, where s = (a + b + c)/2.\n\nThe area can also be expressed as (AB * AC * sin A)/2.\n\nAlternatively, since we know cos A, we can find sin A = sqrt(1 - (7/13)^2) = sqrt(1 - 49/169) = sqrt(120/169) = (2*sqrt(30))/13.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express the sides in terms of angles, then use the inradius formula.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote AB = c, AC = b, BC = a.\n\nThen, according to the Law of Sines:\n\na = 2R sin A = 26 sin A,\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nc = 26 sin C.\n\nWe also know that cos A = 7/13, so sin A = 2*sqrt(30)/13.\n\nTherefore, a = 26*(2 sqrt(30)/13) = 4 sqrt(30).\n\nWait, 26 divided by 13 is 2, so yes, 2*2 sqrt(30) = 4 sqrt(30). Hmm, okay.\n\nSo BC = a = 4\u221a30.\n\nNow, let's think about the inradius formula. The inradius r = area / s, where s is the semiperimeter.\n\nSo area = r*s = 6*s.\n\nAlso, area can be written as (1/2)*AB*AC*sin A = (1/2)*b*c*sin A.\n\nSo (1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s.\n\nWe need to find AB * AC, which is b*c. Let me denote x = b*c. Then,\n\n(1/2)*x*(2*sqrt(30)/13) = 6*s.\n\nHmm, so (x * sqrt(30)) /13 = 6s.\n\nBut I need another relation involving s and the sides.\n\nThe semiperimeter s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nBut I also know from the Law of Sines that:\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nc = 26 sin C,\n\nand since A + B + C = \u03c0,\n\nB + C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can use some trigonometric identities here.\n\nAlternatively, since we know angle A, maybe express sin B and sin C in terms of angle A.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that in triangle ABC,\n\nsin B / b = sin C / c = 1/(2R) = 1/26.\n\nWait, Law of Sines says a/sin A = 2R, so sin A = a/(2R). Wait, but we already used that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the inradius in terms of angles. Wait, maybe not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nand the area is 6*s,\n\nand also area = (1/2)*b*c*sin A,\n\nso setting them equal:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s,\n\nso (b c sin A)/12 = s,\n\nbut s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nso:\n\n(b c sin A)/12 = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nMultiply both sides by 12:\n\nb c sin A = 6(a + b + c)\n\nHmm, so that's an equation involving b, c, and a. Since a is already known as 4\u221a30,\n\nand b and c are related via the Law of Sines.\n\nLet me denote angle B and angle C.\n\nWe have angle A known, so angle B + angle C = \u03c0 - A.\n\nAlso, from Law of Sines,\n\nb = 26 sin B,\n\nc = 26 sin C,\n\nand since angle C = \u03c0 - A - B,\n\nso sin C = sin(\u03c0 - A - B) = sin(A + B).\n\nWait, sin(\u03c0 - x) = sin x, so sin(\u03c0 - A - B) = sin(A + B). Hmm, but angle C = \u03c0 - A - B, so sin C = sin(A + B). Hmm, but not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that angle B + angle C = \u03c0 - A,\n\nso let me set angle B = \u03b8, then angle C = \u03c0 - A - \u03b8.\n\nTherefore,\n\nb = 26 sin \u03b8,\n\nc = 26 sin(\u03c0 - A - \u03b8) = 26 sin(A + \u03b8).\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too involved. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can use the formula for the inradius in terms of the sides:\n\nr = (a + b - c)/2 * tan(A/2) ?\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, let me recall that inradius r = (area)/(semiperimeter),\n\nand area can also be written as r*s, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can use the formula that relates R, r, and the angles. Wait, Euler's formula gave us a relation here, but we might need another relation.\n\nAlternatively, since we have angle A, perhaps we can express the sides in terms of angle B and C, but this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that in triangle ABC,\n\nusing the Law of Cosines:\n\na\u00b2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc cos A,\n\nand since we know a = 4\u221a30,\n\nand cos A =7/13,\n\nso let's plug that in:\n\n(4\u221a30)^2 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - 2bc*(7/13)\n\nCalculating left side: 16*30 = 480,\n\nso:\n\n480 = b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (14/13) bc.\n\nHmm, okay. So that's one equation involving b and c.\n\nWe also have from the area expressions:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s,\n\nwhere s = (a + b + c)/2 = (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2.\n\nWe know sin A = 2\u221a30 /13,\n\nso substituting:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*(2\u221a30/13) = 6*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 )\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n( b c \u221a30 ) /13 = 6*(4\u221a30 + b + c)/2\n\nMultiply both sides by 13:\n\nb c \u221a30 = 6*13*(4\u221a30 + b + c)/2\n\nSimplify right side:\n\n6*13/2 = 39,\n\nso:\n\nb c \u221a30 = 39*(4\u221a30 + b + c)\n\nHmm, so:\n\nb c \u221a30 = 39*4\u221a30 + 39b + 39c\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nLeft side: b c \u221a30,\n\nRight side: 156\u221a30 + 39b + 39c\n\nLet me rearrange the equation:\n\nb c \u221a30 - 39b - 39c = 156\u221a30\n\nHmm, this seems a bit messy, but maybe we can find a substitution here. Let me denote x = b and y = c, so:\n\nx y \u221a30 - 39x - 39y = 156\u221a30\n\nHmm. Also from the Law of Cosines equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (14/13)xy = 480\n\nHmm, so two equations with two variables x and y. This might be solvable, but it's going to be a bit involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a smarter approach here. Let me think again.\n\nWe need to find AB * AC, which is b*c. Let me denote that as K = b*c. Our goal is to find K.\n\nLooking back at the equation from the area:\n\n(1/2)*b*c*sin A = 6*s,\n\nand s = (a + b + c)/2,\n\nso substituting,\n\n(1/2)*K*(2\u221a30 /13) = 6*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 )\n\nSimplify left side:\n\n( K * \u221a30 ) /13 = 3*(4\u221a30 + b + c )\n\nWait, let me check:\n\nWait, (1/2)*K*(2\u221a30 /13) = (K * \u221a30)/13,\n\nand right side is 6*( (4\u221a30 + b + c)/2 ) = 3*(4\u221a30 + b + c )\n\nTherefore:\n\n(K * \u221a30)/13 = 3*(4\u221a30 + b + c )\n\nHmm, so rearranged:\n\nK * \u221a30 = 39*(4\u221a30 + b + c )\n\nHmm, similar to before. Let me see if I can express b + c in terms of K and other variables.\n\nFrom the Law of Cosines equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - (14/13)xy = 480,\n\nwhere x = b, y = c.\n\nWe can write x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy,\n\nso substituting,\n\n(x + y)^2 - 2xy - (14/13)xy = 480,\n\nso,\n\n(x + y)^2 - (2 + 14/13)xy = 480,\n\nCompute 2 + 14/13 = 26/13 +14/13 = 40/13,\n\nThus,\n\n(x + y)^2 - (40/13)xy = 480,\n\nLet me denote S = x + y, and P = xy = K,\n\nso,\n\nS\u00b2 - (40/13) P = 480.\n\nAlso, from the area equation above,\n\nK * \u221a30 = 39*(4\u221a30 + S )\n\nSo let's write that as:\n\nK * \u221a30 = 156\u221a30 + 39 S,\n\nthen,\n\nK * \u221a30 - 39 S = 156\u221a30,\n\nLet me write this as equation (1):\n\n\u221a30 K - 39 S = 156\u221a30,\n\nand equation (2):\n\nS\u00b2 - (40/13) K = 480.\n\nSo now, we have two equations with variables S and K. Let's try to solve them.\n\nFrom equation (1):\n\n\u221a30 K = 156\u221a30 + 39 S,\n\nDivide both sides by \u221a30:\n\nK = 156 + (39 / \u221a30) S,\n\nHmm, but maybe better to express S in terms of K, or vice versa.\n\nAlternatively, let's rearrange equation (1):\n\n\u221a30 K - 39 S = 156\u221a30,\n\nLet me solve for S:\n\n39 S = \u221a30 K - 156\u221a30,\n\nso,\n\nS = (\u221a30 / 39) K - (156\u221a30)/39,\n\nSimplify:\n\nS = (\u221a30 / 39) K - 4\u221a30,\n\nSo S = (\u221a30 / 39) (K - 156),\n\nHmm, okay. Let me plug this into equation (2):\n\nS\u00b2 - (40/13) K = 480.\n\nSubstitute S:\n\n[ (\u221a30 / 39 (K - 156) ) ]\u00b2 - (40/13) K = 480.\n\nThis looks complicated, but let's compute step by step.\n\nFirst, let me compute S squared term:\n\n[ (\u221a30 / 39 (K - 156) ) ]\u00b2 = (30)/(39\u00b2) (K - 156)^2\n\nSo,\n\n30/(39\u00b2) (K - 156)^2 - (40/13) K = 480\n\nLet me compute 39 squared: 39\u00b2 = 1521,\n\nso,\n\n30/(1521) (K - 156)^2 - (40/13) K = 480,\n\nLet me write all terms over a common denominator, perhaps 1521.\n\nFirst term is 30/(1521)*(K - 156)^2,\n\nSecond term: - (40/13) K = - (40*117)/1521 * K, since 13*117=1521,\n\nWait 13*117 is 1521? Let me check: 13*100=1300, 13*17=221, so total 1521, yes.\n\nSo, 40/13 = (40*117)/1521,\n\nTherefore,\n\nSecond term is - (40*117)/1521 * K,\n\nThird term is 480 = 480*1521 /1521,\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\n[30(K - 156)^2 - 40*117 K + 480*(-1521)] / 1521 = 0,\n\nWait, actually, moving 480 to the left side,\n\nthe equation is:\n\n30/(1521)*(K - 156)^2 - (40/13) K - 480 = 0,\n\nSo multiplying all terms by 1521,\n\n30(K - 156)^2 - 40*117 K - 480*1521 = 0,\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: 30(K\u00b2 - 312 K + 156\u00b2),\n\nSecond term: -40*117 K,\n\nThird term: -480*1521,\n\nLet me compute constants:\n\nFirst term:\n\n30K\u00b2 - 30*312 K + 30*(156)^2,\n\nSecond term:\n\n- 40*117 K = -4680 K,\n\nThird term:\n\n-480*1521 = let's compute that: 480*1500=720,000, 480*21=10,080, so total 720,000 +10,080=730,080, so with the negative: -730,080.\n\nPutting all together:\n\n30K\u00b2 - 30*312 K + 30*(156)^2 -4680 K -730,080 = 0,\n\nCompute each coefficient:\n\nFirst term: 30K\u00b2.\n\nSecond term: -30*312 K = -9360 K,\n\nThird term: 30*(156)^2,\n\nLet me compute 156 squared: 156*156,\n\n156*156: 150\u00b2 + 2*150*6 +6\u00b2 = 22500 + 1800 +36= 24336,\n\nSo 30*24336 = 730,080.\n\nFourth term: -4680 K,\n\nFifth term: -730,080.\n\nTherefore, combining all terms:\n\n30K\u00b2 -9360 K +730,080 -4680 K -730,080 = 0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n30K\u00b2 - (9360 +4680)K + (730,080 -730,080) = 0,\n\nSo,\n\n30K\u00b2 -14,040 K = 0,\n\nFactor:\n\n30K(K - 468) =0,\n\nThus, K =0 or K =468.\n\nSince K = b*c, which is a product of sides, it can't be zero, so K=468.\n\nTherefore, the product AB*AC is 468.\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify if that makes sense.\n\nWait, so plugging back in, K=468,\n\nthen from equation (1):\n\n\u221a30 *468 - 39 S =156\u221a30,\n\nSo,\n\n\u221a30*(468 -156) = 39 S,\n\n\u221a30*(312) =39 S,\n\nTherefore,\n\nS = (312 /39)*\u221a30 = 8*\u221a30,\n\nSo S =8\u221a30,\n\nWhich is the sum of sides b + c =8\u221a30,\n\nAlso, from equation (2):\n\nS\u00b2 - (40/13)*468 =480,\n\nCompute S squared: (8\u221a30)^2 =64*30=1920,\n\n(40/13)*468= (40)*(468/13)=40*36=1440,\n\nTherefore,\n\n1920 -1440 =480,\n\nWhich matches the equation. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 468.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense in the context of the problem. Let me see:\n\nGiven that the inradius is 6 and the circumradius is 13, and angle A has cos 7/13, so angle A is acute. The product of AB and AC is 468. Let me see if with sides b and c such that b*c=468 and b +c =8\u221a30. Let me see what numbers would satisfy that.\n\nSuppose b and c are the roots of the equation x\u00b2 - (8\u221a30)x +468 =0,\n\nDiscriminant D= (8\u221a30)^2 -4*1*468 = 64*30 -1872= 1920 -1872=48,\n\nSo sqrt(D)=sqrt(48)=4*sqrt(3),\n\nThus,\n\nx=(8\u221a30 \u00b14\u221a3)/2=4\u221a30 \u00b12\u221a3,\n\nTherefore, sides are 4\u221a30 +2\u221a3 and 4\u221a30 -2\u221a3,\n\nHmm, that seems plausible. The sides would be positive since 4\u221a30 is about 4*5.477\u224821.9, and 2\u221a3\u22483.464, so both sides are positive. So that works.\n\nTherefore, the product AB*AC=468.\n\nThus, the answer is 468.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{468}\n\n\nGiven triangle \\( \\triangle ABC \\) with circumcenter \\( O \\) and incenter \\( I \\), where \\( \\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI} \\), circumradius \\( R = 13 \\), and inradius \\( r = 6 \\).
