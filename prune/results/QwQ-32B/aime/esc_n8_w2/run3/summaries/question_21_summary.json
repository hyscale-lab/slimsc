      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. A b-beautiful number has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of the number itself. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A two-digit number in base b would be written as \"ab\" where a is the first digit (the coefficient for b^1) and b is the second digit (the coefficient for b^0). Wait, but hold on, the problem says \"these two digits sum to sqrt(n)\". So actually, the digits themselves (each between 0 and b-1, but the first digit can't be zero because it's a two-digit number) must add up to the square root of the number n.\n\nSo, let's formalize this. Let me denote the two digits as d1 and d0, where d1 is the first digit (so d1 is between 1 and b-1) and d0 is the second digit (between 0 and b-1). Then the number n in base 10 is equal to d1*b + d0. The condition is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). So, substituting n, we get:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0\n\nHmm, maybe rearrange terms:\n\nd1^2 + (2d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can rearrange the original equation differently. Let me see.\n\nStarting again from (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nd1^2 + 2d1d0 + d0^2 - d1b - d0 = 0\n\nHmm, maybe group terms with d1:\n\nd1^2 + d1*(2d0 - b) + (d0^2 - d0) = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of this as a quadratic equation in terms of d1? Let's see.\n\nYes, if I treat d0 as a constant, then this is a quadratic in d1:\n\nd1^2 + (2d0 - b) d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe treat it as a quadratic in terms of d0? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me set s = d1 + d0, so s = sqrt(n). Then n = s^2, so n = s^2. Also, n = d1*b + d0. Therefore, s^2 = d1*b + d0. But since s = d1 + d0, so substituting:\n\ns^2 = (s - d0)*b + d0\n\nWait, because d1 = s - d0? Wait, no, s = d1 + d0, so d1 = s - d0. Therefore, substituting into n = d1*b + d0 gives:\n\ns^2 = (s - d0)*b + d0\n\nLet me rearrange that equation:\n\ns^2 = s*b - d0*b + d0\n\nBring all terms to left-hand side:\n\ns^2 - s*b + d0*b - d0 = 0\n\nFactor terms with d0:\n\ns^2 - s*b + d0*(b - 1) = 0\n\nSolving for d0:\n\nd0*(b - 1) = s*b - s^2\n\nThus,\n\nd0 = [s*b - s^2] / (b - 1)\n\nHmm, so d0 must be an integer between 0 and b-1, since it's a digit in base b. Similarly, d1 = s - d0 must be between 1 and b-1. Since s = d1 + d0, s must be at least 1 + 0 = 1, but since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be at least b (since the first digit is at least 1, so n = d1*b + d0 >= 1*b + 0 = b). But n = s^2, so s^2 >= b. Therefore, s must be at least sqrt(b). Also, since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, their sum s = d1 + d0 must be at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. Therefore, s <= 2b - 2. Therefore, s is between sqrt(b) and 2b - 2.\n\nBut s must also be an integer because it's the sum of two integers d1 and d0, and sqrt(n) must be integer since s is an integer. Wait, n = s^2, so sqrt(n) is s, which is an integer. Therefore, s is an integer. So s must be an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and 2b - 2.\n\nTherefore, for each base b, we can iterate over possible s in that range and see if d0 is an integer between 0 and b - 1, and then check if d1 = s - d0 is between 1 and b - 1.\n\nAlternatively, since d0 must be an integer, from the equation d0 = [s*b - s^2]/(b - 1). Let me see if I can write that as:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)] / (b - 1)\n\nHmm, so that expression must be an integer between 0 and b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each s in the possible range, we can compute d0 as [s(b - s)]/(b - 1). Since d0 must be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by (b - 1). So s(b - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Let me denote that as:\n\ns(b - s) \u2261 0 mod (b - 1)\n\nLet me see if I can manipulate this congruence.\n\nNote that b \u2261 1 mod (b - 1). Therefore, s(b - s) \u2261 s(1 - s) mod (b - 1). Therefore, the congruence becomes:\n\ns(1 - s) \u2261 0 mod (b - 1)\n\nSo, s(1 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1).\n\nAlternatively, s(s - 1) \u2261 0 mod (b - 1). So, (s^2 - s) \u2261 0 mod (b - 1).\n\nHmm, perhaps this can help us find possible s for each b? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to express the equation for d0 again:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)] / (b - 1)\n\nWe can write this as d0 = [s(b - s)] / (b - 1). Since d0 must be an integer between 0 and b-1, this gives constraints on s. Let me think of s as varying, and for each s, compute d0 and see if it's valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rearrange terms to get:\n\nLet me denote t = b - 1, so that b = t + 1. Then:\n\nd0 = [s(t + 1 - s)] / t\n\n= [s(t + 1 - s)] / t\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps try to find s such that s(b - s) is divisible by (b -1). Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each base b, we can iterate over possible s values (from s_min to s_max) and check if d0 is an integer in [0, b-1], and d1 is in [1, b-1].\n\nBut since we need to find the minimal b where there are more than 10 such numbers, maybe we can find a formula for the number of solutions for each b and then find the minimal b where that number exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe find a relationship between s and b. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider the equation again:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)] / (b - 1)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nd0 = s - [s^2]/(b - 1)\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, s(b - s) = s*b - s^2, so:\n\nd0 = (s*b - s^2)/(b -1 ) = s*(b - s)/(b - 1)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rearranged:\n\nLet me consider that s must be such that s*(b - s) is divisible by (b - 1). Let me denote k = b -1. Then the equation becomes:\n\nd0 = s*( (k +1) - s ) / k = [s(k +1 - s)] /k\n\nSo, to have d0 integer, s(k +1 -s) must be divisible by k.\n\nTherefore, s(k +1 - s) \u2261 0 mod k.\n\nLet me compute s(k +1 - s) mod k.\n\nNote that k +1 \u2261 1 mod k, so:\n\ns(1 - s) mod k \u2261 0 mod k\n\nThus, s(1 - s) \u2261 0 mod k\n\nTherefore, s(s -1 ) \u2261 0 mod k.\n\nTherefore, either s \u2261 0 mod k or s \u2261 1 mod k.\n\nWait, no, because s(s-1) \u22610 mod k. So either s \u22610 mod k, or s \u22611 mod k, or the factors s and s-1 individually divide k. Wait, actually, more precisely, the product must be divisible by k, so either:\n\nEither s \u22610 mod k,\n\nOr s \u22611 mod k,\n\nOr factors of k divide into s and s-1 such that their product is divisible by k.\n\nHmm, but this might not be straightforward. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, since their product is divisible by k, the factors of k must be partitioned between s and s-1. So, any prime power in k's factorization must divide either s or s-1, but not both. Therefore, k divides s(s-1).\n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that k divides s(s-1). Since k = b -1, so (b -1) divides s(s - 1). So, for each s, we can check whether (b -1) divides s(s - 1). If so, then d0 is integer, and then we can check if d0 is between 0 and b -1 and d1 = s - d0 is between 1 and b -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key idea is that for each b, the number of solutions s (and hence the number of b-beautiful numbers) is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), 2b -2] such that (b -1) divides s(s -1), and then d0 must also satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b -1 and d1 = s - d0 must be between 1 and b -1.\n\nHmm, but maybe there is a better way. Let me see if I can express s in terms of b?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that s must satisfy s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b -1). Let me suppose that s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b -1). So, for each b, the possible s are those integers where s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s \u22611 mod (b-1). Wait, but actually, more precisely, s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod ( (b -1)/d ), where d is a divisor? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Since s and s-1 are coprime, then for each prime p dividing (b-1), p divides either s or s-1, but not both. Therefore, the solutions s must satisfy s \u22610 mod p or s\u22611 mod p for each prime p dividing (b-1). So the solutions are determined by the Chinese Remainder Theorem over the prime factors of (b-1). But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed numerically, trying to find for each b, how many s satisfy the conditions, and then find when that number exceeds 10. Since the question asks for the minimal such b, perhaps we can start testing b from 2 upwards until we find the first b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nHowever, doing this manually would take time, so maybe find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that s must be between sqrt(b) and 2b -2. Let me see, the minimal s is ceil( sqrt(b) ), and the maximal s is 2b -2. Let me see for some small b:\n\nTake b=2. Then possible s must be between ceil(sqrt(2))=2 and 2*2 -2=2. So s=2. Let's check:\n\nd0 = [2*(2 - 2)]/(2-1)= 0. So d0=0, d1=2 -0=2. But in base 2, the digits can only go up to 1. So d1=2 is invalid. So no solution here. So zero numbers for b=2.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nWait, in base 2, two-digit numbers are from 10_2 (2) to 11_2 (3). The digits sum to 1+0=1 vs sqrt(2)\u22481.414, which isn't integer. 1+1=2 vs sqrt(3)\u22481.732. Neither works. So indeed zero.\n\nb=3:\n\nsqrt(b)=sqrt(3)\u22481.732, so s must be at least 2. Max s is 2*3 -2=4. So s can be 2,3,4.\n\nCheck each s:\n\nFor s=2:\n\nd0 = [2*(3 - 2)]/(3-1)= (2*1)/2=1. So d0=1, d1=2 -1=1. Then n=1*3 +1=4. sqrt(4)=2, which matches s=2. So that works. So (d1,d0)=(1,1) gives n=4. So that's valid. So count 1.\n\ns=3:\n\nd0 = [3*(3 -3)]/(2) =0. So d0=0, d1=3-0=3. But in base 3, the first digit can be at most 2. So d1=3 is invalid. So reject.\n\ns=4:\n\nd0 = [4*(3 -4)]/(2) = [4*(-1)]/2 = -2. Negative, which is invalid. So s=4 invalid.\n\nThus, only 1 solution for b=3.\n\nb=4:\n\nsqrt(4)=2, so s starts at 2. Max s is 2*4-2=6. So s from 2 to 6.\n\nCheck each s:\n\ns=2:\n\nd0 = [2*(4-2)]/(4-1)= (2*2)/3 \u2248 1.333, not integer. So no.\n\ns=3:\n\nd0 = [3*(4-3)]/3 = (3*1)/3=1. So d0=1, d1=3-1=2. Check n=2*4 +1=9. sqrt(9)=3, which matches s=3. Valid. So count 1.\n\ns=4:\n\nd0= [4*(4-4)]/3=0. d1=4-0=4. But in base 4, first digit can be up to 3. So d1=4 invalid.\n\ns=5:\n\nd0= [5*(4 -5)]/3 = [5*(-1)]/3 \u2248 -1.666 invalid.\n\ns=6:\n\nd0= [6*(4 -6)]/3 = [6*(-2)]/3 = -4, invalid.\n\nThus only 1 solution (s=3) for b=4.\n\nHmm, so maybe b=5?\n\nWait, proceeding this way for each b is tedious, but maybe we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let's see for a general b, how many s satisfy the equation?\n\nLet me consider that s must satisfy s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). Let me denote k = b-1. Then the condition is s(s-1) \u22610 mod k. So s \u22610 or 1 mod any prime divisor of k? Not exactly, but as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), 2b -2] such that s \u22610 or 1 mod d for each prime factor of (b-1). Hmm, perhaps too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that s and s-1 are coprime, so for their product to be divisible by (b-1), the factors of (b-1) must be partitioned between s and s-1. Therefore, (b-1) must divide s*(s-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide s or (b-1) divides (s-1). Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, if (b-1) is 6, then s could be divisible by 2 and s-1 divisible by 3, which would make their product divisible by 6 even though neither divides 6.\n\nTherefore, the condition is that (b-1) divides s(s-1). So the number of s in the required range where (b-1) divides s(s-1). To find how many such s exist, perhaps for each b, the number of s in the interval [ceil(sqrt(b)), 2b -2] such that s \u22610 or 1 mod gcd(b-1, something). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that s can be written as s = m or s = m +1 where m divides (b-1). Wait, perhaps not exactly. Maybe better to consider that s must be congruent to 0 mod d or 1 mod d for each prime power in the factorization of (b-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of getting stuck here, I can try to find for each b, the possible s values.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation again:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1)\n\nSince d0 must be between 0 and b-1, inclusive, let's see:\n\n0 \u2264 [s(b - s)]/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nMultiply all terms by (b -1):\n\n0 \u2264 s(b - s) \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nFirst inequality: s(b - s) \u22650. Since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and 2b -2, then s is positive, and (b - s) can be positive or negative. Wait, s can be up to 2b - 2, so when s exceeds b, then (b - s) becomes negative. Hmm, so s(b - s) would be negative in that case, so d0 would be negative, which is invalid. Therefore, actually, s must be \u2264 b, otherwise the term (b - s) becomes negative, making s(b - s) negative, so d0 would be negative, which is invalid. Therefore, the upper bound for s is actually b, not 2b -2. Wait, this is a key point I might have missed earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again. The maximum possible s (sum of digits) would be (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b -2, but if s exceeds b, then (b - s) becomes negative, so s(b - s) becomes negative, so d0 would be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, actually, s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b. Because if s is greater than b, then d0 becomes negative. Therefore, the upper bound for s is b.\n\nTherefore, the valid range for s is ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 s \u2264 b.\n\nTherefore, s can go up to b, but not beyond. That's an important correction. So the upper limit is actually s_max = b. So that's better.\n\nTherefore, for each b, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b].\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to counting the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b] such that (b -1) divides s(b - s), and also that d0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1) is between 0 and b-1, and d1 = s - d0 is between 1 and b-1.\n\nWait, but since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b, and d0 is non-negative (since s \u2264 b, so (b - s) \u22650, so s(b - s) is non-negative, and divided by (b -1), so d0 is non-negative). Also, d0 must be \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1) must be \u2264 b -1.\n\nTherefore,\n\ns(b - s) \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\n=> s(b - s) \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\ns(b - s) - (b -1)^2 \u22640\n\nLet me denote this as quadratic in s:\n\n-s^2 + b s - (b -1)^2 \u22640\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):\n\ns^2 - b s + (b -1)^2 \u22650\n\nLet me compute discriminant:\n\nD = b^2 - 4*(b -1)^2 = b^2 -4(b\u00b2 - 2b +1) = b\u00b2 -4b\u00b2 +8b -4 = -3b\u00b2 +8b -4\n\nHmm, discriminant of the quadratic equation s^2 -b s + (b-1)^2 =0. If discriminant is negative, then the quadratic is always positive (since coefficient of s\u00b2 is positive). Let me check discriminant D:\n\nD = -3b\u00b2 +8b -4\n\nSet to zero:\n\n-3b\u00b2 +8b -4 =0\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n3b\u00b2 -8b +4 =0\n\nSolutions:\n\nb = [8 \u00b1 sqrt(64 -48)] /6 = [8 \u00b1 sqrt(16)] /6 = [8 \u00b14]/6\n\nThus, b=(8+4)/6=12/6=2, or b=(8-4)/6=4/6=2/3. Since b must be integer \u22652, so D=0 at b=2. For b>2, D becomes negative? Let me check for b=3:\n\nD= -3*(9) +8*3 -4= -27+24-4= -7 <0. So yes, for b\u22652, D is \u22640 except at b=2 where D=0. Therefore, for b\u22652, the quadratic s\u00b2 -b s + (b-1)^2 is always non-negative (since D\u22640), so the inequality s\u00b2 -b s + (b-1)^2 \u22650 is always true. Therefore, the inequality s(b -s) \u2264 (b-1)^2 is always true. Therefore, d0 is always \u2264 b-1. So the upper limit on d0 is automatically satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the constraints reduce to:\n\n1. s must be an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b.\n\n2. s(b - s) must be divisible by (b-1).\n\n3. d0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1) must be an integer between 0 and b-1.\n\n4. d1 = s - d0 must be between 1 and b-1.\n\nBut since d0 is non-negative and s \u2264 b, then d1 = s - d0 \u2265 s - (b -1). Since s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)), so s - (b -1) could be negative? Wait, let's see. Let me see if d1 is at least 1.\n\nd1 = s - d0 = s - [s(b - s)/(b-1)]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nd1 = [s(b -1) - s(b - s)] / (b -1)\n\nWait, let me compute numerator:\n\ns(b -1) - s(b - s) = s(b -1 - b + s) = s(s -1)\n\nTherefore,\n\nd1 = [s(s -1)]/(b -1)\n\nAh! So d1 = [s(s -1)]/(b -1). \n\nWait, so d1 must be an integer between 1 and b -1. So:\n\nd1 = [s(s -1)]/(b -1)\n\nTherefore, since d1 must be an integer, this requires that (b -1) divides s(s -1). Wait, but that was already our previous condition. So this is redundant. Therefore, once we have s such that (b -1) divides s(s -1), then d0 and d1 are automatically integers. But also, we need to ensure that d1 is between 1 and b -1.\n\nSo, given that d1 = [s(s -1)]/(b -1). Since s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b, let's see what d1 must be:\n\nSince s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)), and s \u2264 b.\n\nLet me see, for s = ceil(sqrt(b)), let's see:\n\nd1 = [s(s-1)]/(b-1). Since s is at least sqrt(b), so s^2 \u2248 b, so s(s-1) \u2248 b, so d1 \u2248 1. So maybe it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, let's see for s = b:\n\nd1 = [b(b -1)]/(b -1) = b. But since in base b, the first digit can be at most b-1, so d1 = b is invalid. Therefore, s = b would lead to d1 = b, which is invalid, so s = b is excluded. Therefore, actually s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nWait, so s can go up to b-1. Let me check:\n\nIf s = b, then d1 = [b(b-1)]/(b -1) = b, which is invalid as the first digit can't be b. Therefore, s must be at most b-1. Therefore, the upper bound is actually s_max = b -1.\n\nWait, but earlier when s is up to b, but s =b gives d1 =b, which is invalid, so the maximum s is b -1.\n\nTherefore, the valid range for s is ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 s \u2264 b -1.\n\nTherefore, the steps to compute the number of b-beautiful numbers for a given b are:\n\n1. For the given b, compute s_min = ceil( sqrt(b) ), s_max = b -1.\n\n2. For each integer s from s_min to s_max:\n\n   a. Check if (b -1) divides s(s -1).\n\n   b. If yes, compute d0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1).\n\n   c. Check if d0 is between 0 and b -1 (which it should be as we saw earlier).\n\n   d. Compute d1 = s - d0 = [s(s -1)]/(b -1).\n\n   e. Check if d1 is between 1 and b -1.\n\n   f. If all conditions met, then this s corresponds to a valid b-beautiful number n = d1*b + d0 = s^2.\n\nTherefore, the count is the number of s in s_min to s_max where the above conditions hold.\n\nAlternatively, since d1 must be between 1 and b-1, let me see if that adds any additional constraints. Since d1 = [s(s-1)]/(b -1). We need 1 \u2264 [s(s-1)]/(b -1) \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo,\n\n1 \u2264 s(s -1)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nMultiply all terms by (b -1):\n\nb -1 \u2264 s(s -1) \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nHmm, so s(s -1) must be between b -1 and (b -1)^2.\n\nBut since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, let's see:\n\nThe minimal s is ceil(sqrt(b)), so s(s-1) is at least ceil(sqrt(b))*(ceil(sqrt(b)) -1). For example, if b is a square, say b = m\u00b2, then ceil(sqrt(b))=m, so s(s-1)=m(m-1). The minimal s(s-1) would be m(m-1). The maximum s(s-1) is (b -1)(b -2).\n\nBut maybe this is not necessary. Let's proceed.\n\nTherefore, the key condition is that (b -1) divides s(s -1). So for each b, the number of s between s_min and s_max where s(s -1) is divisible by (b -1).\n\nHence, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that s \u22610 mod (b -1) or s \u22611 mod (b -1). Wait, but s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, then (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. Because since their GCD is 1, the factors must divide separately.\n\nAh! That's a crucial point. Since s and s-1 are coprime, the fact that (b-1) divides their product implies that (b-1) divides s or (b-1) divides (s -1). Because if two coprime numbers multiply to a multiple of N, then each must divide N. Wait, actually, more precisely, since GCD(s, s-1)=1, then (b-1) must divide s or (b-1) must divide (s -1). Because any prime divisor of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1, but not both. Since they are coprime, so the entire (b-1) must divide one of them.\n\nTherefore, the condition s(s-1) divisible by (b-1) is equivalent to (b-1 divides s) or (b-1 divides (s-1)).\n\nTherefore, s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s\u22611 mod (b-1).\n\nTherefore, the possible s must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo (b-1). But s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1).\n\nBut since mod (b-1), the residues 0 and 1 can only be achieved in the range [1, b-1]. Since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, so the possible s's that are \u22610 mod (b-1) must be s = b-1 (since 0 mod (b-1) in that interval is only b-1 if b-1 divides b-1, which it does). Wait, s= b-1 is \u22610 mod (b-1). Similarly, s \u22611 mod (b-1) would be s=1 +k*(b-1). But since s must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)), let's see:\n\nPossible s \u22610 mod (b-1): only s = b-1 (since 0 mod (b-1) in 1..b-1 is only b-1). Wait, but actually, 0 mod (b-1) is equivalent to s = m*(b-1). The only s in 1..b-1 is s=b-1 when m=1.\n\nSimilarly, s\u22611 mod (b-1): the numbers congruent to 1 mod (b-1) in [1, b-1] is s=1. Because 1 mod (b-1) is 1, and adding (b-1) would get to b, which is beyond the upper limit of b-1. So the only s \u22611 mod (b-1) in that interval is s=1.\n\nWait, but s has to be at least ceil(sqrt(b)). So unless ceil(sqrt(b)) \u22641, which only occurs when b=1 or 2. Since b \u22652, ceil(sqrt(2))=2. Therefore, for b\u22652, s=1 is below the minimum s_min=ceil(sqrt(b)) except when b=2, but for b=2, s_min=2, so s=1 is still below. Therefore, actually, there are no solutions from s\u22611 mod (b-1) except when s=1 is within the interval, which it isn't for b\u22652.\n\nWait, so does that mean that the only possible s that satisfy the congruence are s = b-1 (for s\u22610 mod (b-1)) and s=1 (which is too low). Hence, only s = b-1?\n\nWait, but that can't be, because in the earlier example with b=13, 81 is 63 in base 13. Let's check for b=13.\n\nFor b=13, s_min = ceil(sqrt(13))=4, s_max=12.\n\nLooking for s in 4 to 12 where s \u22610 or 1 mod 12 (since b-1=12). So s\u22610 mod12: s=12. s\u22611 mod12: s=1, which is too low. So only s=12.\n\nBut in the example given, 81 is 63 in base 13, so s=6+3=9. Wait, but according to this, only s=12 would be valid. But the example uses s=9, so this suggests a problem with my reasoning.\n\nWait, there's an error here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the example given is 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 is 63 in base 13, and 6+3=9= sqrt(81). So s=9, which is not congruent to 0 or1 mod12 (since 9 mod12 is 9). So my previous conclusion must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so my mistake was in assuming that since s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide s or s-1. But actually, that's only if (b-1) is square-free. Wait, no, actually, even if (b-1) has repeated prime factors, the condition is still that the prime factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. However, if (b-1) has a square factor, say p\u00b2 divides (b-1), then p must divide either s or s-1, but not both, so p\u00b2 could divide one of them. So the conclusion that (b-1) divides s or (b-1) divides s-1 is only true when (b-1) is square-free?\n\nWait, perhaps my mistake was in the logic. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that (b-1) divides s(s-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, then any prime power dividing (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. So, for each prime power p^k dividing (b-1), p^k divides s or p^k divides (s-1). Therefore, (b-1) can be written as a product of factors, each of which divides s or divides (s-1). However, it's not necessary that the entire (b-1) divides s or divides (s-1). It can be split between s and s-1. For example, in the case of b=13, b-1=12=3\u00d74. So 3 divides s or s-1, and 4 divides s or s-1. So for s=9:\n\nCheck 12 divides s(s-1)=9\u00d78=72. 72/12=6, so yes. So 12 divides 72. \n\nNow, 3 divides 9, and 4 divides 8. So the factors 3 and 4 are split between s and s-1, hence their product divides the product s(s-1). So the condition is satisfied even if neither 12 divides s nor 12 divides s-1. Therefore, my previous conclusion was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is that (b-1) divides s(s-1), but s does not have to be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo (b-1). Instead, it's a more general condition. Therefore, my earlier approach of testing each s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 for divisibility is necessary.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the only way is to find for each b the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). To find when this count exceeds 10, we need to find the minimal b where this happens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each b the number of solutions s by noting that s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). So the number of solutions s in that interval is equal to the number of solutions to s \u22610 or 1 mod d, where d divides (b-1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). Let me denote m = b-1. So m divides s(s-1). The number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides s(s-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, the number of s between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m where s(s-1) \u22610 mod m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for m = b-1, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] with s(s-1) \u22610 mod m.\n\nThis seems difficult. Maybe we can think in terms of divisors.\n\nSuppose m = (b-1). Let me think of the equation s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod e, where d*e divides m? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that s(s-1) \u22610 mod m implies that s \u22610 mod gcd(m, s) and s \u22611 mod gcd(m, s-1). Hmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m], the number of s where m divides s(s-1). Let me see for m =12 (b=13):\n\nWe need s in [4, 12], find s where 12 divides s(s-1). Let's check each s from 4 to 12:\n\ns=4: 4\u00d73=12 \u219212 divides 12 \u2192 yes. So s=4 is valid.\n\ns=5:5\u00d74=20 \u219220 mod12=8 \u2192 no.\n\ns=6:6\u00d75=30 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\ns=7:7\u00d76=42 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\ns=8:8\u00d77=56 mod12= 56-48=8 \u2192 no.\n\ns=9:9\u00d78=72 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ns=10:10\u00d79=90 mod12= 90-72=18 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\ns=11:11\u00d710=110 mod12: 110-96=14 mod12=2 \u2192 no.\n\ns=12:12\u00d711=132 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo for m=12 (b=13), s=4,9,12 are valid. So three solutions. Which matches the example given (s=9 is one of them, so there are three numbers, including the example). So in the problem statement, 81 is one of them. So for b=13, there are 3 b-beautiful numbers, which is less than 10.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with b=13:\n\ns=4:\n\nd0 = [4*(13 -4)]/(12)= (4*9)/12= 36/12=3. So d0=3, d1=4-3=1. Then n=1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4, which matches. So 16 is another.\n\ns=9: as given.\n\ns=12:\n\nd0 = [12*(13-12)]/12 = (12*1)/12=1. d1=12 -1=11. So n=11*13 +1=143. sqrt(143)\u224811.96, which is not integer. Wait a second, this is a problem.\n\nWait, hold on, sqrt(143) is not 12? 12^2=144. So n=143, which is not 12\u00b2. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, there's a mistake here. If s=12, then n should be s\u00b2=144. Let me check the calculation again:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1) = [12*(13 -12)]/(12) = (12*1)/12=1. So d0=1, d1=12 -1=11. Then n=11*13 +1= 143. But 143 is not 12 squared. So discrepancy here.\n\nWait, so my mistake must be in the equation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWe have the equation:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nBut we also have:\n\nd1 + d0 = s\n\nThus, substituting d1 = s - d0,\n\ns^2 = (s - d0)*b + d0\n\nThen rearranged,\n\ns^2 = s*b - d0*b + d0\n\nThen,\n\nd0*(b -1) = s*b - s^2\n\nSo,\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1)\n\nTherefore, in the case of s=12, b=13:\n\nd0 = [12*(13 -12)]/(13 -1) = [12*1]/12 =1. So d0=1, d1 =12 -1=11. Then n = d1*b +d0 =11*13 +1=143. However, s=12, so s squared is 144. So discrepancy of 1. Wait, this suggests an error in the derivation.\n\nWait, where is the mistake? Let me retrace.\n\nWe started with:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(n) = s\n\nand n = d1*b +d0 = s^2.\n\nTherefore,\n\nd1*b +d0 = s^2.\n\nBut d1 = s - d0,\n\nSo substituting:\n\n(s - d0)*b + d0 = s^2\n\nExpanding:\n\ns*b - d0*b +d0 = s^2\n\nRearranged:\n\ns*b - s^2 = d0*(b -1)\n\nThus,\n\nd0 = (s*b - s^2)/(b -1) = [s(b - s)]/(b -1). Wait, that's correct.\n\nBut then, if we compute n = d1*b +d0,\n\nwith d1 = s -d0,\n\nthen,\n\nn = (s -d0)*b +d0 = s*b -d0*b +d0 = s*b - d0*(b -1).\n\nBut from the previous equation, d0*(b -1) = s*b - s^2,\n\nThus,\n\nn = s*b - (s*b - s^2) = s\u00b2. Correct.\n\nSo in the case of s=12, b=13,\n\nn should be 12\u00b2=144, but calculation gives 143. Contradiction. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let's compute d1 and d0 again:\n\nd0 = [12*(13 -12)]/12 =1, so d0=1.\n\nd1 =12 -1=11. Then n =11*13 +1 = 143 +1? Wait 11*13 is 143, plus 1 is 144. Oh! Wait, 11*13 is 143, plus d0=1 gives 144. Yes, my mistake in arithmetic earlier. So n=144, which is 12\u00b2. So that works.\n\nPhew, okay, so s=12 is valid. So three solutions for b=13.\n\nSo that works.\n\nSo the process is correct.\n\nTherefore, to proceed, perhaps I need to find for each b, the number of s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). Since doing this manually is tedious, perhaps look for a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, note that s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so coprime. Therefore, for their product to be divisible by m = b-1, m must divide the product of two coprimes. Therefore, m can be factored into two coprime parts, m1 and m2, such that m1 divides s and m2 divides s-1. Since m1 and m2 are coprime, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to split m into coprime factors m1 and m2, and then solve s \u22610 mod m1 and s\u22611 mod m2. The number of solutions would then be the number of such factorizations.\n\nHowever, the number of solutions would depend on the number of divisors of m, but this might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, note that for each divisor d of m = b-1, we can set s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod m/d, provided that d and m/d are coprime. The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that such s exists uniquely modulo m. The number of such divisors d where gcd(d, m/d)=1 would give the number of solutions. But this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of m = b-1. The number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod (m/d) for some divisor d of m. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe notice that the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m = b-1. Because for each divisor d of m, setting s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod (m/d), but this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of m = b-1. Let me test with the example m=12 (b=13):\n\nThe divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. The number of solutions was 3 (s=4,9,12). Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m where d divides s and m/d divides s-1. Since s must be in the interval, the number of such s would be the number of such d. For m=12:\n\nPossible d's dividing 12:\n\nTake d=1: need s \u22610 mod1 (always true) and s\u22611 mod12. So s=1 mod12. In [4,12], s=1 is too low, s=13 is outside. So no solution here.\n\nd=2: s\u22610 mod2, s\u22611 mod6 (since 12/2=6). So s must be even and \u22611 mod6. So s\u22614 mod6 (since 1 mod6 even is 4 mod6). So s=4,10 in [4,12]. Check:\n\ns=4: yes, 4 mod6 is 4\u22611 mod6? 4 mod6 is 4, which is not 1. Wait, maybe my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, if d=2 divides s, so s even, and m/d=6 divides s-1. So s-1 must be divisible by 6. Thus s=1 mod6. So s must be even and \u22611 mod6. So s= (6k +1) even. Let me see:\n\n6k +1 even \u2192 6k must be odd, which is impossible. So no solution here.\n\nHmm.\n\nd=3: s\u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod4 (since 12/3=4). So s \u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\nFind s in [4,12].\n\nLet me list numbers \u22611 mod4: 5,9,13. Among these, divisible by 3: 9. So s=9.\n\nd=4: s\u22610 mod4, s\u22611 mod3 (since 12/4=3). So s divisible by4, and \u22611 mod3.\n\nNumbers divisible by4 in [4,12]:4,8,12.\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n4 mod3=1 \u2192 yes, so 4 is okay.\n\n8 mod3=2 \u2192 no.\n\n12 mod3=0 \u2192 no. So s=4.\n\nd=6: s\u22610 mod6, s\u22611 mod2 (since 12/6=2). So s divisible by6, and s\u22611 mod2. But divisible by6 implies even, so s\u22610 mod2. Contradiction. So no solution.\n\nd=12: s\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod1. The second condition is always true. So s\u22610 mod12. Thus s=12. Which is valid.\n\nThus total solutions from divisors d=3,4,12 give s=9,4,12. So three solutions, which matches the example. So the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m where the congruence conditions can be satisfied, leading to s in the required interval. Each divisor d gives at most one solution. So the number of solutions is equal to the number of such valid divisors d.\n\nThus, the number of solutions for m is equal to the number of divisors d of m such that the congruence conditions have a solution s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m].\n\nTherefore, to compute the number of solutions for a given m = b-1:\n\n1. Find all divisors d of m.\n\n2. For each divisor d of m, compute the required congruence s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (m/d). If such s exists and lies in the interval [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m], then count it.\n\n3. The total number is the number of such valid divisors d.\n\nAlternatively, this is getting too involved. Maybe it's better to write a table for m from 1 upwards (since b starts at 2, m starts at 1):\n\nBut since this is a thought process, let me try to find the minimal m (so minimal b=m+1) where the number of solutions exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look for m where m has many divisors. Since the number of solutions is related to the number of divisors, maybe when m is highly composite, like 12, 24, 60, etc., the number of solutions would be higher.\n\nLet me try m=24 (so b=25). Let's compute the number of solutions:\n\nm=24, so b=25. The interval for s is ceil(sqrt(25))=5 to 24.\n\nWe need to find s in [5,24] such that 24 divides s(s-1).\n\nLet me compute s(s-1) mod24=0.\n\nPossible s:\n\ns must be such that 24 divides s(s-1). Since 24=8\u00d73.\n\nThus, s(s-1) must be divisible by 8 and 3.\n\nDivisible by 3: Either s \u22610 mod3 or s\u22611 mod3.\n\nDivisible by 8: Either s \u22610 mod8 or s\u22611 mod8 (since s and s-1 are consecutive, so one of them must be even, but to get divisibility by 8, one of them must be divisible by 8 or both divisible by 2 and 4? Wait, need s(s-1) divisible by 8. Since s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even. The even one must be divisible by 8, or the even one divisible by 4 and the other even? Let me think:\n\nTo have s(s-1) divisible by 8, since they are consecutive:\n\nEither the even one is divisible by 8, or the even one is divisible by 4 and the other is even (but they are consecutive, so only one is even). Wait:\n\nWait, in two consecutive numbers, exactly one is even. Let me denote:\n\nIf s is even, then s must be divisible by 8, or s divisible by 4 and s-1 divisible by 2 (but s-1 is odd, so no). Wait, no, that won't help. Alternatively:\n\nThe even number must be divisible by 8, because if it's divisible by 4 but not 8, then the other is odd, so the total would only have 2\u00d74=8? Wait:\n\nLet me think:\n\nSuppose s is even:\n\nLet s =2k. Then s-1 is odd. Then s(s-1)=2k*(2k -1). To have this divisible by 8, 2k must be divisible by 8, so k divisible by 4. Thus s divisible by 8.\n\nSimilarly, if s is odd, then s-1 is even. Let s-1=2k, so s=2k+1. Then s(s-1)=(2k+1)(2k). To be divisible by 8, 2k must be divisible by 8 (so k divisible by4) or 2k divisible by 4 and 2k+1 even (which it isn't). So 2k divisible by 8, so k divisible by4. Thus s-1 divisible by8. Therefore, in either case, the even number among s and s-1 must be divisible by8.\n\nTherefore, the condition reduces to s \u22610 mod8 or s\u22611 mod8.\n\nAdditionally, must also be divisible by3. So combining:\n\nWe need s \u22610 mod3 or 1 mod3,\n\nAND\n\ns \u22610 mod8 or 1 mod8.\n\nSo we can consider four cases:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod8 and s\u22610 mod3: s\u22610 mod lcm(8,3)=24 \u2192 s=24.\n\n2. s\u22610 mod8 and s\u22611 mod3:\n\nFind s \u22610 mod8 and 1 mod3.\n\nLet s=8k. Then 8k\u22611 mod3 \u2192 8\u22612 mod3 \u21d2 2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2 k\u22612 mod3. Thus s=8*(3m +2)=24m +16.\n\nWithin [5,24], s=16, 40,\u2026 but 40>24. So s=16.\n\n3. s\u22611 mod8 and s\u22610 mod3:\n\ns=8k +1. Then 8k+1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d28k \u2261-1 mod3 \u21d22k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3. Thus s=8*(3m+1)+1=24m +9.\n\nWithin [5,24], s=9, 33,\u2026 so s=9.\n\n4. s\u22611 mod8 and s\u22611 mod3:\n\ns=8k+1\u22611 mod3 \u21d28k\u22610 mod3 \u21d22k\u22610 mod3 \u21d2k\u22610 mod3. So s=8*(3m)+1=24m +1. Within [5,24], s=1,25,\u2026 so s=1 is too low, 25 is over. So none.\n\nThus the solutions are s=24,16,9.\n\nWait, but also need to check divisibility by3 and 8:\n\nWait, but let me check each s in [5,24] which are \u22610 or1 mod8 and \u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nWait, but the above method gives s=9,16,24.\n\nCheck each:\n\ns=9:\n\n9 mod8=1, 9 mod3=0 \u2192 satisfies case3 (1 mod8 and 0 mod3). So yes.\n\ns=16:\n\n16 mod8=0, 16 mod3=1 \u2192 case2 (0 mod8 and 1 mod3). Yes.\n\ns=24:\n\n24 mod8=0, mod3=0 \u2192 case1. Yes.\n\nAdditionally, let me check if there are other solutions:\n\nCheck s= 8 mod24? But 8 is in the interval.\n\nWait s=8:\n\nCheck s=8: 8 mod8=0, mod3=2. So not in any of the cases above.\n\ns=8: s(s-1)=8\u00d77=56. 56 mod24=8. Not 0. So no.\n\ns=1: too low.\n\ns= 24: yes.\n\nWait, s= 24 is in the interval [5,24].\n\nWait, what about s= 17? Let me check s=17:\n\n17 mod8=1, mod3=2. So not in cases.\n\n17\u00d716=272. 272 mod24= 272 -11\u00d724=272-264=8 \u22600.\n\ns= 25 is over.\n\nWait, maybe there are more solutions?\n\nWait, let me try s= 21:\n\ns=21 mod8=5, mod3=0. Not in cases.\n\n21\u00d720=420. 420 mod24=420-17\u00d724=420-408=12\u22600.\n\ns= 12:\n\n12 mod8=4, mod3=0. Not in cases.\n\n12\u00d711=132 mod24=132-5\u00d724=132-120=12\u22600.\n\nHmm, so only 9,16,24. So three solutions. So m=24 (b=25) only has three solutions. Not enough.\n\nHmm, perhaps m=60 (b=61). That might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider m= 240 (b=241). Maybe overkill.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m= 60 (b=61). Let me try m=60 (b=61):\n\ns must be between ceil(sqrt(61))=8 and 60.\n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by60.\n\n60 factors into 4\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nTherefore, s(s-1) must be divisible by4,3,5.\n\nDivisible by4: as before, either s\u22610 mod8 or s\u22611 mod8 (since similar to before, the even term must be divisible by4).\n\nWait, actually, to be divisible by4:\n\nEither s divisible by4 or s-1 divisible by4. Since s and s-1 are consecutive, only one is even. The even one must be divisible by4.\n\nSimilarly, divisible by3: s\u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nDivisible by5: s\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, need to satisfy:\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod4 (Wait, actually, for divisibility by4:\n\nEither s is even and divisible by4, or s-1 divisible by4 (if s is odd). Wait, similar to the previous logic.\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nTo have s(s-1) divisible by4:\n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive, exactly one is even. Let the even one be divisible by4. So:\n\nIf s is even, then s divisible by4,\n\nIf s is odd, then s-1 divisible by4 (so s \u22611 mod4).\n\nThus, s \u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4.\n\nWait, more precisely, s \u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, if s even: s divisible by4 \u2192 s\u22610 mod4,\n\nIf s odd: s-1 divisible by4 \u2192 s\u22611 mod4.\n\nThus, overall, s \u22610 or1 mod4.\n\nSimilarly, mod3:\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod3,\n\nmod5:\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nTherefore, combining all these conditions, the solutions must satisfy:\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod5,\n\nand s in [8,60].\n\nThe number of solutions would be the number of s in that interval satisfying all three.\n\nThis is getting complex, but perhaps manageable.\n\nTo count the number of s in [8,60] that are \u22610 or1 mod4, mod3, mod5.\n\nAlternatively, the conditions can be combined using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nWe can consider all combinations of residues:\n\nFor mod4: 0 or1,\n\nmod3:0 or1,\n\nmod5:0 or1.\n\nEach combination gives a system of congruences.\n\nThere are 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 possible combinations.\n\nFor each combination, solve the system:\n\ns \u2261 a mod4,\n\ns\u2261b mod3,\n\ns\u2261c mod5,\n\nwhere a \u2208{0,1}, b\u2208{0,1}, c\u2208{0,1}.\n\nFor each of the 8 combinations, find the solutions s in [8,60], then count them.\n\nThis is tedious but possible.\n\nLet me start with one combination:\n\nCase1: a=0 mod4, b=0 mod3, c=0 mod5.\n\nFind s \u22610 mod4, 0 mod3,0 mod5.\n\nThus s\u22610 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60. So s=60k. In [8,60], s=60.\n\nCase2: a=0 mod4, b=0 mod3, c=1 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod4, 0 mod3,1 mod5.\n\nLet me solve:\n\ns \u22610 mod12 (lcm(4,3)=12),\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet s=12m. Then 12m \u22611 mod5 \u21d2 12m \u22612m \u22611 mod5 \u21d22m\u22611 mod5 \u21d2m\u22613 mod5 (since 2\u00d73=6\u22611 mod5).\n\nThus m=5n+3. Then s=12*(5n+3)=60n +36.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0 gives s=36, n=1 gives 96>60. So s=36.\n\nCase3: a=0 mod4, b=1 mod3, c=0 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod4, 1 mod3,0 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod20 (lcm(4,5)=20),\n\ns\u22611 mod3.\n\nLet s=20k. 20k \u22611 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k \u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3.\n\nThus k=3n+2. s=20*(3n+2)=60n +40.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0 gives s=40, n=1 gives 100>60. So s=40.\n\nCase4: a=0 mod4, b=1 mod3, c=1 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet me combine mod3 and mod5 first.\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod15 (lcm(3,5)=15).\n\nThus s=15k+1.\n\nAlso s\u22610 mod4 \u21d215k+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d23k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4.\n\nThus k=4n+1. Thus s=15*(4n+1)+1=60n +16.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0: 16, n=1:76>60. So s=16.\n\nCase5: a=1 mod4, b=0 mod3, c=0 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4, 0 mod3,0 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 mod15 (lcm(3,5)=15).\n\nLet s=15k. 15k \u22611 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2k\u22613 mod4.\n\nThus k=4n+3. s=15*(4n+3)=60n +45.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0 gives45, n=1 gives105>60. So s=45.\n\nCase6: a=1 mod4, b=0 mod3, c=1 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nFirst combine mod3 and mod5:\n\ns\u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22616 mod15 (since 6 mod3=0,6 mod5=1).\n\nThus s=15k+6.\n\nAlso s\u22611 mod4 \u21d215k+6 \u22611 mod4 \u21d215k \u2261-5 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k \u2261-5 mod4 \u21d23k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4.\n\nThus k=4n+1. s=15*(4n+1)+6=60n +21.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0 gives21, n=1 gives81>60. So s=21.\n\nCase7: a=1 mod4, b=1 mod3, c=0 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 mod5.\n\nCombine mod3 and mod4 first:\n\ns\u22611 mod12 (lcm(3,4)=12).\n\nAlso s\u22610 mod5.\n\nThus s\u226112k +1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait s\u22611 mod4 and 1 mod3 \u21d2s\u22611 mod12,\n\nand s\u22610 mod5.\n\nLet me write s=12m +1. Then 12m +1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d212m \u2261-1 mod5 \u21d212\u22612 mod5 \u21d22m \u2261-1 mod5 \u21d22m\u22614 mod5 \u21d2m\u22612 mod5.\n\nThus m=5n+2. s=12*(5n+2)+1=60n +25.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0 gives25, n=1 gives85>60. So s=25.\n\nCase8: a=1 mod4, b=1 mod3, c=1 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60. So s\u22611 mod60. In [8,60], s=61 is over, so no solution.\n\nThus total solutions from all cases:\n\nCase1:60,\n\nCase2:36,\n\nCase3:40,\n\nCase4:16,\n\nCase5:45,\n\nCase6:21,\n\nCase7:25,\n\nCase8: none.\n\nThus total solutions are 7 values:16,21,25,36,40,45,60. So seven solutions.\n\nWait, but let me check each:\n\nCheck s=16:\n\n16 mod4=0, mod3=1 (16/3=5 rem1), mod5=1 (16 mod5=1). So yes, case4.\n\ns=21: mod4=1 (21 mod4=1), mod3=0 (21/3=7), mod5=1. So case6.\n\nWait, 21 mod3 is 0, mod5=1. So case6 is correct.\n\ns=25 mod4=1, mod3=1 (25 mod3=1), mod5=0. So case7.\n\nYes, case7.\n\ns=36 mod4=0 (36 mod4=0), mod3=0 (36 mod3=0), mod5=1 (36 mod5=1). So case2.\n\ns=40 mod4=0, mod3=1 (40 mod3=1), mod5=0. case3.\n\ns=45 mod4=1 (45 mod4=1), mod3=0, mod5=0. case5.\n\ns=60 mod4=0, mod3=0, mod5=0. case1.\n\nSo total seven solutions. Thus for m=60 (b=61), there are seven b-beautiful numbers. Still under 10.\n\nHmm, perhaps m needs to be larger.\n\nWait, maybe m= 120 (b=121). Let me see:\n\nBut this might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I need to find a better approach.\n\nLet me think of the number of solutions s for m = b-1. The number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m where the congruence conditions can be satisfied, as before. However, the exact count requires checking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when m is a factorial number, like 12! but that's too big. Alternatively, m being a highly composite number.\n\nAlternatively, note that in the previous examples, m=12 (b=13) had 3 solutions, m=24 (b=25) had 3 solutions, m=60 (b=61) had 7 solutions. Maybe when m is 240, but this is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for m where the number of solutions is more than 10. Let me see if m= 240 (b=241):\n\nBut this is going to take a while. Alternatively, perhaps think of m= 2520 (the least common multiple of 1-8), but that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m= 252 (b=253). Let me try m=252 (b=253):\n\nThe number of solutions would be the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(253))=16, 252] such that s(s-1) divisible by252.\n\n252 factors into 4\u00d79\u00d77. So divisible by 4, 9,7.\n\nThus, s(s-1) divisible by 4,9,7.\n\nDivisible by4: s\u22610 or1 mod4,\n\nDivisible by9: s\u22610 or1 mod9,\n\nDivisible by7: s\u22610 or1 mod7.\n\nSo need to satisfy s\u22610 or1 mod4, mod9, mod7.\n\nThis is going to have many combinations. The number of solutions would be 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 possibilities for residues mod4, mod9, mod7. Each combination would give a solution if it exists in the interval.\n\nThis could give up to 8 solutions, but perhaps more due to overlapping conditions. However, even 8 is less than 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m= 120 (b=121):\n\nm=120, factors 8\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nDivisible by8,3,5.\n\nThus:\n\nDivisible by8:\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod8,\n\nDivisible by3:\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod3,\n\nDivisible by5:\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 combinations.\n\nEach combination gives a system of congruences. Let me try:\n\nTake a=0 mod8, b=0 mod3, c=0 mod5:\n\ns\u22610 mod lcm(8,3,5)=120 \u2192 s=120.\n\nWithin [11,120], so s=120.\n\nAnother combination:\n\na=0 mod8, b=0 mod3, c=1 mod5:\n\ns\u22610 mod24 (lcm(8,3)=24),\n\nand s\u22611 mod5.\n\n24m \u22611 mod5 \u21d224\u22614 mod5 \u21d24m\u22611 mod5 \u21d2m\u22614 mod5.\n\nThus m=5k+4. s=24*(5k+4)=120k +96.\n\nWithin [11,120], k=0 gives96, k=1 gives216>120. So s=96.\n\nContinuing this way, each combination may give one solution, so 8 solutions. Plus possibly more?\n\nWait, maybe some combinations allow multiple solutions within the interval.\n\nAlternatively, total of 8 solutions for m=120. Not enough.\n\nHmm, this is taking too long. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, let's think of s(s-1) divisible by m =b-1.\n\nThe equation s(s-1) \u22610 mod m.\n\nThe number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] is equal to the number of integers s in that interval where s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod (m/d) for some divisor d of m.\n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m such that there exists s in the interval with s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod (m/d).\n\nEach divisor d gives a possible solution if the congruence has a solution in the interval.\n\nThe total number is the number of such divisors d where the congruence has a solution in the interval.\n\nTo maximize this number, m should have many divisors. So the number of solutions is roughly proportional to the number of divisors of m. Therefore, to get over 10 solutions, m must have over 10 divisors.\n\nThe number of divisors function d(m) grows with m's factors. The first m with d(m) >10 are m=24 (d=8), m=30 (d=8), m=36 (d=9), m=40 (d=8), m=48 (d=10), m=60 (d=12). \n\nAh, m=60 has 12 divisors. Let's check m=60 again. Earlier count gave 7 solutions, but maybe my count was wrong.\n\nWait, m=60, b=61, the interval is [8,60].\n\nThe divisors of60 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60.\n\nLet me try the divisor approach again:\n\nFor each divisor d of60, set s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (60/d).\n\nFind s in [8,60].\n\nFor example:\n\nd=1: s\u22610 mod1 (always true), s\u22611 mod60. s=1 mod60 \u2192 s=1,61,\u2026 so only s=61 is outside. No solution in [8,60].\n\nd=2: s\u22610 mod2, s\u22611 mod30.\n\ns must be even and s\u22611 mod30 \u2192 s=30k+1 even. 30k+1 even \u21d230k must be odd, impossible. No solution.\n\nd=3: s\u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod20.\n\nFind s \u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod20.\n\nLet s=20k+1. 20k+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d220k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3.\n\nThus k=3m+1. s=20*(3m+1)+1=60m +21.\n\nWithin [8,60], m=0 gives21, m=1 gives81>60. So s=21.\n\nd=4: s\u22610 mod4, s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\nLet s=15k+1. 15k+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4.\n\nThus k=4m+1. s=15*(4m+1)+1=60m +16.\n\nWithin [8,60], m=0 gives16, m=1 gives76>60. So s=16.\n\nd=5: s\u22610 mod5, s\u22611 mod12.\n\ns\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod12.\n\ns=12k+1. 12k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d212k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d212\u22612 mod5 \u21d22k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k\u22612 mod5.\n\nThus k=5m+2. s=12*(5m+2)+1=60m +25.\n\nWithin interval: m=0 gives25, m=1 gives85>60. So s=25.\n\nd=6: s\u22610 mod6, s\u22611 mod10.\n\ns\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod10.\n\ns=10k+1. 10k+1\u22610 mod6 \u21d210k\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d210\u22614 mod6 \u21d24k\u22615 mod6 \u21d24k\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d24k\u22615 mod6.\n\n4k mod6=5 \u21d2 possible?\n\n4k mod6 can be 0,4,2,0,4,2,... never 5. So no solution.\n\nd=10: s\u22610 mod10, s\u22611 mod6.\n\ns\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod6.\n\ns=10k. 10k\u22611 mod6 \u21d210k\u22614k \u22611 mod6 \u21d24k\u22611 mod6 \u21d2 multiply both sides by inverse of4 mod6. But gcd(4,6)=2, which doesn't divide1, so no solution.\n\nd=12: s\u22610 mod12, s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns=12k. 12k\u22611 mod5 \u21d212k\u22612k\u22611 mod5 \u21d22k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22613 mod5.\n\nk=5m+3. s=12*(5m+3)=60m+36.\n\nWithin interval: m=0 gives36, m=1 gives96>60. So s=36.\n\nd=15: s\u22610 mod15, s\u22611 mod4.\n\ns\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\ns=15k. 15k\u22611 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2k\u22613 mod4.\n\nk=4m+3. s=15*(4m+3)=60m+45.\n\nWithin interval: m=0 gives45, m=1 gives105>60. So s=45.\n\nd=20: s\u22610 mod20, s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns\u22610 mod20 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=20k. 20k\u22611 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3.\n\nk=3m+2. s=20*(3m+2)=60m+40.\n\nWithin interval: m=0 gives40, m=1 gives100>60. So s=40.\n\nd=30: s\u22610 mod30, s\u22611 mod2.\n\ns\u22610 mod30 and s\u22611 mod2. Since 30 is even, s=30k is even, but must be \u22611 mod2 (odd). Contradiction. No solution.\n\nd=60: s\u22610 mod60, s\u22611 mod1. The second congruence is always true. Thus s=60. Which is in the interval.\n\nThus total solutions from each divisor d are s=21,16,25,36,45,40,60. That's seven solutions, as before. So my previous count was correct.\n\nHmm. So m=60 gives seven solutions. Need to find m where the number of solutions exceeds 10.\n\nLet me try m= 240 (b=241). Let me see how many divisors it has.\n\n240 factors as 2^4\u00d73\u00d75. The number of divisors is (4+1)(1+1)(1+1)=5\u00d72\u00d72=20 divisors.\n\nPerhaps this will give more solutions.\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe m= 360 (b=361):\n\n360 factors into 2^3\u00d73^2\u00d75. Divisors count: (3+1)(2+1)(1+1)=4\u00d73\u00d72=24.\n\nBut even this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m= 840 (b=841):\n\n840=2^3\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77. Divisors count: (3+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=4\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72=32.\n\nBut this is getting too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 121 (m=120) but we saw it gives 8 solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps m= 120 (divisors count 16) gives more?\n\nWait let's try m= 240 (b=241). Let's try a few of its divisors.\n\nTake d= 16 (divisor of 240):\n\nd=16: s\u22610 mod16, s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns=15k+1. 15k+1\u22610 mod16 \u21d215k \u2261-1 mod16 \u21d215\u2261-1 mod16 \u21d2-k\u2261-1 mod16 \u21d2k\u22611 mod16.\n\nThus k=16m+1. s=15*(16m+1)+1=240m +16.\n\nWithin [16,240], m=0 gives16, m=1 gives256.\n\ns=256 is within [16,240]? 240 is the upper limit, so 256 exceeds.\n\nThus only s=16.\n\nAnother divisor d= 5:\n\nd=5: s\u22610 mod5, s\u22611 mod48.\n\ns=48k+1. 48k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d248k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d248\u22613 mod5 \u21d23k\u22614 mod5 \u21d23k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d2k\u22613 mod5 (since 3\u00d73=9\u2261-1).\n\nk=5m+3. s=48*(5m+3)+1=240m +145.\n\nWithin [16,240], m=0 gives145, m=1 gives385>240. So s=145.\n\nSimilarly, each divisor can give one solution. Since there are 20 divisors, but many will not give solutions in the interval or will have no solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m where the solution s from the congruence is in the interval. Since m=240 has many divisors, perhaps this gives enough solutions.\n\nBut I think this is going to take too long. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem: find the least b where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. The example given is b=13 has 3. Let me see for b=100:\n\nWait, perhaps trying m= 120 (b=121). Let me see:\n\nm=120. The number of solutions was 8. Not enough.\n\nWait, let me think of the possible s values.\n\nEach solution corresponds to a pair (d, m/d) where d divides m. The number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m where the solution s exists in the interval. Since each such divisor gives a unique solution, the total number is the number of such divisors.\n\nThus, if m has more than 10 divisors, perhaps there are more than 10 solutions. But the number of solutions is not exactly equal to the number of divisors, since some divisors may lead to s outside the interval or no solution.\n\nWait, for m= 240, which has 20 divisors, maybe half of them give solutions within the interval, leading to 10 or more.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider m= 360 (b=361):\n\nDivisors of 360: many, but let me see.\n\nTake d= 2: s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod180.\n\ns=180k+1. 180k+1 \u22610 mod2 \u21d2180k must be odd, which is impossible. No solution.\n\nd=3: s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod120.\n\ns=120k+1. 120k+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d2120k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d20\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d2 no solution.\n\nd=4: s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod90.\n\ns=90k+1. 90k+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d290k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d290\u22612 mod4 \u21d22k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d22k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2 no solution.\n\nd=5: s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod72.\n\ns=72k+1. 72k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d272k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d272\u22612 mod5 \u21d22k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k\u22612 mod5.\n\nThus k=5m+2. s=72*(5m+2)+1=360m+145.\n\nWithin [ceil(sqrt(361))=19, 360], m=0 gives145, m=1 gives505>360. So s=145.\n\nContinuing this way, each valid divisor may contribute one solution. Since m=360 has 24 divisors, perhaps half of them give valid solutions, totaling around 12. That could be over 10.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal b is 361 (m=360). But maybe smaller m.\n\nAlternatively, m= 252 (b=253):\n\nNumber of divisors of252 is (2^2\u00d73^2\u00d77) \u2192 (2+1)(2+1)(1+1)=3\u00d73\u00d72=18 divisors.\n\nPerhaps this gives enough solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m= 180 (b=181):\n\nDivisors of180: 18 divisors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m= 240 gives 12 solutions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m= 210 (b=211):\n\n210=2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77. Divisors count: 16.\n\nBut perhaps enough.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal m is 240 (b=241). Let me try m= 240:\n\ns must be between ceil(sqrt(241))=16 and 240.\n\nThe number of solutions would be the number of divisors d of240 where the solution s is in [16,240].\n\nLet me consider a few divisors:\n\nd=16:\n\ns\u22610 mod16 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns=15k+1. 15k+1\u22610 mod16 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod16 \u21d2-k\u2261-1 \u21d2k\u22611 mod16.\n\nk=16m+1. s=15*(16m+1)+1=240m +16.\n\nWithin interval: m=0 gives16, m=1 gives256, which is within [16,240]? 256 is greater than 240? No, 256>240. So only s=16.\n\nd=15:\n\ns\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod16.\n\ns=16k+1. 16k+1\u22610 mod15 \u21d216k\u2261-1 mod15 \u21d216\u22611 mod15 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod15 \u21d2k=15m-1.\n\nThus s=16*(15m-1)+1=240m-16+1=240m-15.\n\nWithin interval: m=1 gives225, m=2 gives465>240. So s=225.\n\nd= 24:\n\ns\u22610 mod24 and s\u22611 mod10.\n\ns=10k+1. 10k+1\u22610 mod24 \u21d210k\u2261-1 mod24 \u21d210k\u226123 mod24.\n\nMultiply both sides by inverse of10 mod24. Since gcd(10,24)=2, which doesn't divide23, no solution.\n\nd= 5:\n\ns\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod48.\n\ns=48k+1. 48k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d248k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d248\u22613 mod5 \u21d23k\u22614 mod5 \u21d23k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d2k\u22613 mod5.\n\nk=5m+3. s=48*(5m+3)+1=240m+145.\n\nWithin interval: m=0 gives145, m=1 gives385>240. So s=145.\n\nd= 8:\n\ns\u22610 mod8 and s\u22611 mod30.\n\ns=30k+1. 30k+1\u22610 mod8 \u21d230k\u2261-1 mod8 \u21d230\u22616 mod8 \u21d26k\u22617 mod8 \u21d26k\u2261-1 mod8 \u21d2 multiply both sides by inverse of6 mod8, which is inverse of 6 mod8 is 6\u00d76=36\u22614 mod8, not inverse. Wait, gcd(6,8)=2, so equation 6k\u22617 mod8 has no solution.\n\nd= 10:\n\ns\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod24.\n\ns=24k+1. 24k+1\u22610 mod10 \u21d224k\u2261-1 mod10 \u21d224\u22614 mod10 \u21d24k\u22619 mod10 \u21d24k\u2261-1 mod10 \u21d2k\u22617 mod10 (since 4\u00d77=28\u22618 mod10, not. Wait 4\u00d7?\u22619 mod10. 4\u00d77=28\u22618, 4\u00d72=8. Hmm, no solution. So no.\n\nd= 60:\n\ns\u22610 mod60 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\ns=4k+1. 4k+1\u22610 mod60 \u21d24k\u2261-1 mod60 \u21d24k\u226159 mod60 \u21d2k\u2261(59\u00d715) mod60 (since inverse of4 mod60 is 15 because 4\u00d715=60\u22610 mod60? No. Wait inverse of4 mod60 must satisfy 4x \u22611 mod60. But gcd(4,60)=4, so no solution unless 4 divides1, which it doesn't. Thus no solution.\n\nd= 40:\n\ns\u22610 mod40 and s\u22611 mod6.\n\ns=6k+1. 6k+1\u22610 mod40 \u21d26k\u2261-1 mod40 \u21d26k\u226139 mod40 \u21d2k\u2261(39\u00d76^{-1}) mod40.\n\nFind inverse of6 mod40: 6\u00d7 34=204\u2261204-5\u00d740=4 \u21d2 no. 6\u00d7 34=204, 204 mod40=204-5\u00d740=4 \u21d2 not. 6\u00d7 26=156 mod40=156-3\u00d740=36. Hmm, perhaps inverse doesn't exist. gcd(6,40)=2. 2 divides39? 39 is odd. So no solution.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I need to consider that the minimal b is 121 (m=120) with 8 solutions, 241 (m=240) with perhaps 12 solutions.\n\nWait, the problem asks for the least b where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. So perhaps the answer is 241? But I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps b= 121 has 8, b= 169 (m=168):\n\nWait m=168 has divisors: 16 factors.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider m= 240 (b=241):\n\nSuppose there are 12 solutions. Let me count some:\n\nTake divisors of240:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, 240.\n\nLet me try some:\n\nd=1: no solution.\n\nd=2: s\u22610 mod2, s\u22611 mod120.

Not enough.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to try m= 360 (b=361).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the problem's constraints.\n\nWait, maybe the number of solutions is actually equal to the number of divisors d of m where d divides s and m/d divides s-1, and s is in the interval. So for each divisor d of m, there is at most one solution s. So the total number of solutions is the number of such divisors d where s is in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m].\n\nHence, to have more than 10 solutions, m must have over 10 such divisors d where s is in the interval.\n\nThe number of such divisors d is equal to the number of divisors d of m such that the solution s for the congruence s\u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (m/d) lies within the interval.\n\nThis count can be approximated by the number of divisors of m, but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121 (m=120).

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting an answer where m is a factorial number or highly composite.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the number of solutions increases when m has many divisors. The first m with over 10 divisors is m= 60 (12 divisors) but gives only7 solutions. Next is m= 72 (12 divisors?), no, 72 has divisors: 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12,18,24,36,72 \u219212 divisors.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. A b-beautiful number has exactly two digits in base b, and the sum of those two digits equals the square root of the number itself. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. A two-digit number in base b would be written as \"ab\" where a is the first digit (the coefficient for b^1) and b is the second digit (the coefficient for b^0). Wait, but hold on, the problem says \"these two digits sum to sqrt(n)\". So actually, the digits themselves (each between 0 and b-1, but the first digit can't be zero because it's a two-digit number) must add up to the square root of the number n.\n\nSo, let's formalize this. Let me denote the two digits as d1 and d0, where d1 is the first digit (so d1 is between 1 and b-1) and d0 is the second digit (between 0 and b-1). Then the number n in base 10 is equal to d1*b + d0. The condition is that d1 + d0 = sqrt(n). So, substituting n, we get:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(d1*b + d0)\n\nLet me square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\n(d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nBring all terms to one side:\n\nd1^2 + 2*d1*d0 + d0^2 - d1*b - d0 = 0\n\nHmm, maybe rearrange terms:\n\nd1^2 + (2d0 - b)*d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can rearrange the original equation differently. Let me see.\n\nStarting again from (d1 + d0)^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nd1^2 + 2d1d0 + d0^2 - d1b - d0 = 0\n\nHmm, maybe group terms with d1:\n\nd1^2 + d1*(2d0 - b) + (d0^2 - d0) = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe think of this as a quadratic equation in terms of d1? Let's see.\n\nYes, if I treat d0 as a constant, then this is a quadratic in d1:\n\nd1^2 + (2d0 - b) d1 + (d0^2 - d0) = 0\n\nAlternatively, maybe treat it as a quadratic in terms of d0? Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express in terms of variables.\n\nAlternatively, maybe let me set s = d1 + d0, so s = sqrt(n). Then n = s^2, so n = s^2. Also, n = d1*b + d0. Therefore, s^2 = d1*b + d0. But since s = d1 + d0, so substituting:\n\ns^2 = (s - d0)*b + d0\n\nWait, because d1 = s - d0? Wait, no, s = d1 + d0, so d1 = s - d0. Therefore, substituting into n = d1*b + d0 gives:\n\ns^2 = (s - d0)*b + d0\n\nLet me rearrange that equation:\n\ns^2 = s*b - d0*b + d0\n\nBring all terms to left-hand side:\n\ns^2 - s*b + d0*b - d0 = 0\n\nFactor terms with d0:\n\ns^2 - s*b + d0*(b - 1) = 0\n\nSolving for d0:\n\nd0*(b - 1) = s*b - s^2\n\nThus,\n\nd0 = [s*b - s^2] / (b - 1)\n\nHmm, so d0 must be an integer between 0 and b-1, since it's a digit in base b. Similarly, d1 = s - d0 must be between 1 and b-1. Since s = d1 + d0, s must be at least 1 + 0 = 1, but since n is a two-digit number in base b, n must be at least b (since the first digit is at least 1, so n = d1*b + d0 >= 1*b + 0 = b). But n = s^2, so s^2 >= b. Therefore, s must be at least sqrt(b). Also, since d1 and d0 are digits in base b, their sum s = d1 + d0 must be at most (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b - 2. Therefore, s <= 2b - 2. Therefore, s is between sqrt(b) and 2b - 2.\n\nBut s must also be an integer because it's the sum of two integers d1 and d0, and sqrt(n) must be integer since s is an integer. Wait, n = s^2, so sqrt(n) is s, which is an integer. Therefore, s is an integer. So s must be an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and 2b - 2.\n\nTherefore, for each base b, we can iterate over possible s in that range and see if d0 is an integer between 0 and b - 1, and then check if d1 = s - d0 is between 1 and b - 1.\n\nAlternatively, since d0 must be an integer, from the equation d0 = [s*b - s^2]/(b - 1). Let me see if I can write that as:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)] / (b - 1)\n\nHmm, so that expression must be an integer between 0 and b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each s in the possible range, we can compute d0 as [s(b - s)]/(b - 1). Since d0 must be an integer, the numerator must be divisible by (b - 1). So s(b - s) must be divisible by (b - 1). Let me denote that as:\n\ns(b - s) \u2261 0 mod (b - 1)\n\nLet me see if I can manipulate this congruence.\n\nNote that b \u2261 1 mod (b - 1). Therefore, s(b - s) \u2261 s(1 - s) mod (b - 1). Therefore, the congruence becomes:\n\ns(1 - s) \u2261 0 mod (b - 1)\n\nSo, s(1 - s) must be divisible by (b - 1).\n\nAlternatively, s(s - 1) \u2261 0 mod (b - 1). So, (s^2 - s) \u2261 0 mod (b - 1).\n\nHmm, perhaps this can help us find possible s for each b? Not sure yet.\n\nAlternatively, maybe try to express the equation for d0 again:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)] / (b - 1)\n\nWe can write this as d0 = [s(b - s)] / (b - 1). Since d0 must be an integer between 0 and b-1, this gives constraints on s. Let me think of s as varying, and for each s, compute d0 and see if it's valid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe rearrange terms to get:\n\nLet me denote t = b - 1, so that b = t + 1. Then:\n\nd0 = [s(t + 1 - s)] / t\n\n= [s(t + 1 - s)] / t\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps try to find s such that s(b - s) is divisible by (b -1). Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each base b, we can iterate over possible s values (from s_min to s_max) and check if d0 is an integer in [0, b-1], and d1 is in [1, b-1].\n\nBut since we need to find the minimal b where there are more than 10 such numbers, maybe we can find a formula for the number of solutions for each b and then find the minimal b where that number exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe find a relationship between s and b. Let me see.\n\nLet me consider the equation again:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)] / (b - 1)\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nd0 = s - [s^2]/(b - 1)\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nWait, s(b - s) = s*b - s^2, so:\n\nd0 = (s*b - s^2)/(b -1 ) = s*(b - s)/(b - 1)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rearranged:\n\nLet me consider that s must be such that s*(b - s) is divisible by (b - 1). Let me denote k = b -1. Then the equation becomes:\n\nd0 = s*( (k +1) - s ) / k = [s(k +1 - s)] /k\n\nSo, to have d0 integer, s(k +1 -s) must be divisible by k.\n\nTherefore, s(k +1 - s) \u2261 0 mod k.\n\nLet me compute s(k +1 - s) mod k.\n\nNote that k +1 \u2261 1 mod k, so:\n\ns(1 - s) mod k \u2261 0 mod k\n\nThus, s(1 - s) \u2261 0 mod k\n\nTherefore, s(s -1 ) \u2261 0 mod k.\n\nTherefore, either s \u2261 0 mod k or s \u2261 1 mod k.\n\nWait, no, because s(s-1) \u22610 mod k. So either s \u22610 mod k, or s \u22611 mod k, or the factors s and s-1 individually divide k. Wait, actually, more precisely, the product must be divisible by k, so either:\n\nEither s \u22610 mod k,\n\nOr s \u22611 mod k,\n\nOr factors of k divide into s and s-1 such that their product is divisible by k.\n\nHmm, but this might not be straightforward. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, since their product is divisible by k, the factors of k must be partitioned between s and s-1. So, any prime power in k's factorization must divide either s or s-1, but not both. Therefore, k divides s(s-1).\n\nTherefore, the necessary and sufficient condition is that k divides s(s-1). Since k = b -1, so (b -1) divides s(s - 1). So, for each s, we can check whether (b -1) divides s(s - 1). If so, then d0 is integer, and then we can check if d0 is between 0 and b -1 and d1 = s - d0 is between 1 and b -1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key idea is that for each b, the number of solutions s (and hence the number of b-beautiful numbers) is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), 2b -2] such that (b -1) divides s(s -1), and then d0 must also satisfy 0 \u2264 d0 \u2264 b -1 and d1 = s - d0 must be between 1 and b -1.\n\nHmm, but maybe there is a better way. Let me see if I can express s in terms of b?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that s must satisfy s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b -1). Let me suppose that s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b -1). So, for each b, the possible s are those integers where s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s \u22611 mod (b-1). Wait, but actually, more precisely, s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod ( (b -1)/d ), where d is a divisor? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Since s and s-1 are coprime, then for each prime p dividing (b-1), p divides either s or s-1, but not both. Therefore, the solutions s must satisfy s \u22610 mod p or s\u22611 mod p for each prime p dividing (b-1). So the solutions are determined by the Chinese Remainder Theorem over the prime factors of (b-1). But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed numerically, trying to find for each b, how many s satisfy the conditions, and then find when that number exceeds 10. Since the question asks for the minimal such b, perhaps we can start testing b from 2 upwards until we find the first b where the count exceeds 10.\n\nHowever, doing this manually would take time, so maybe find a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that s must be between sqrt(b) and 2b -2. Let me see, the minimal s is ceil( sqrt(b) ), and the maximal s is 2b -2. Let me see for some small b:\n\nTake b=2. Then possible s must be between ceil(sqrt(2))=2 and 2*2 -2=2. So s=2. Let's check:\n\nd0 = [2*(2 - 2)]/(2-1)= 0. So d0=0, d1=2 -0=2. But in base 2, the digits can only go up to 1. So d1=2 is invalid. So no solution here. So zero numbers for b=2.\n\nWait, but let me check:\n\nWait, in base 2, two-digit numbers are from 10_2 (2) to 11_2 (3). The digits sum to 1+0=1 vs sqrt(2)\u22481.414, which isn't integer. 1+1=2 vs sqrt(3)\u22481.732. Neither works. So indeed zero.\n\nb=3:\n\nsqrt(b)=sqrt(3)\u22481.732, so s must be at least 2. Max s is 2*3 -2=4. So s can be 2,3,4.\n\nCheck each s:\n\nFor s=2:\n\nd0 = [2*(3 - 2)]/(3-1)= (2*1)/2=1. So d0=1, d1=2 -1=1. Then n=1*3 +1=4. sqrt(4)=2, which matches s=2. So that works. So (d1,d0)=(1,1) gives n=4. So that's valid. So count 1.\n\ns=3:\n\nd0 = [3*(3 -3)]/(2) =0. So d0=0, d1=3-0=3. But in base 3, the first digit can be at most 2. So d1=3 is invalid. So reject.\n\ns=4:\n\nd0 = [4*(3 -4)]/(2) = [4*(-1)]/2 = -2. Negative, which is invalid. So s=4 invalid.\n\nThus, only 1 solution for b=3.\n\nb=4:\n\nsqrt(4)=2, so s starts at 2. Max s is 2*4-2=6. So s from 2 to 6.\n\nCheck each s:\n\ns=2:\n\nd0 = [2*(4-2)]/(4-1)= (2*2)/3 \u2248 1.333, not integer. So no.\n\ns=3:\n\nd0 = [3*(4-3)]/3 = (3*1)/3=1. So d0=1, d1=3-1=2. Check n=2*4 +1=9. sqrt(9)=3, which matches s=3. Valid. So count 1.\n\ns=4:\n\nd0= [4*(4-4)]/3=0. d1=4-0=4. But in base 4, first digit can be up to 3. So d1=4 invalid.\n\ns=5:\n\nd0= [5*(4 -5)]/3 = [5*(-1)]/3 \u2248 -1.666 invalid.\n\ns=6:\n\nd0= [6*(4 -6)]/3 = [6*(-2)]/3 = -4, invalid.\n\nThus only 1 solution (s=3) for b=4.\n\nHmm, so maybe b=5?\n\nWait, proceeding this way for each b is tedious, but maybe we can find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, let's see for a general b, how many s satisfy the equation?\n\nLet me consider that s must satisfy s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). Let me denote k = b-1. Then the condition is s(s-1) \u22610 mod k. So s \u22610 or 1 mod any prime divisor of k? Not exactly, but as before.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), 2b -2] such that s \u22610 or 1 mod d for each prime factor of (b-1). Hmm, perhaps too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps notice that s and s-1 are coprime, so for their product to be divisible by (b-1), the factors of (b-1) must be partitioned between s and s-1. Therefore, (b-1) must divide s*(s-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide s or (b-1) divides (s-1). Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, if (b-1) is 6, then s could be divisible by 2 and s-1 divisible by 3, which would make their product divisible by 6 even though neither divides 6.\n\nTherefore, the condition is that (b-1) divides s(s-1). So the number of s in the required range where (b-1) divides s(s-1). To find how many such s exist, perhaps for each b, the number of s in the interval [ceil(sqrt(b)), 2b -2] such that s \u22610 or 1 mod gcd(b-1, something). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that s can be written as s = m or s = m +1 where m divides (b-1). Wait, perhaps not exactly. Maybe better to consider that s must be congruent to 0 mod d or 1 mod d for each prime power in the factorization of (b-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of getting stuck here, I can try to find for each b, the possible s values.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation again:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1)\n\nSince d0 must be between 0 and b-1, inclusive, let's see:\n\n0 \u2264 [s(b - s)]/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nMultiply all terms by (b -1):\n\n0 \u2264 s(b - s) \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nFirst inequality: s(b - s) \u22650. Since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and 2b -2, then s is positive, and (b - s) can be positive or negative. Wait, s can be up to 2b - 2, so when s exceeds b, then (b - s) becomes negative. Hmm, so s(b - s) would be negative in that case, so d0 would be negative, which is invalid. Therefore, actually, s must be \u2264 b, otherwise the term (b - s) becomes negative, making s(b - s) negative, so d0 would be negative, which is invalid. Therefore, the upper bound for s is actually b, not 2b -2. Wait, this is a key point I might have missed earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again. The maximum possible s (sum of digits) would be (b-1) + (b-1) = 2b -2, but if s exceeds b, then (b - s) becomes negative, so s(b - s) becomes negative, so d0 would be negative, which is impossible. Therefore, actually, s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b. Because if s is greater than b, then d0 becomes negative. Therefore, the upper bound for s is b.\n\nTherefore, the valid range for s is ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 s \u2264 b.\n\nTherefore, s can go up to b, but not beyond. That's an important correction. So the upper limit is actually s_max = b. So that's better.\n\nTherefore, for each b, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b].\n\nSo now, the problem reduces to counting the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b] such that (b -1) divides s(b - s), and also that d0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1) is between 0 and b-1, and d1 = s - d0 is between 1 and b-1.\n\nWait, but since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b, and d0 is non-negative (since s \u2264 b, so (b - s) \u22650, so s(b - s) is non-negative, and divided by (b -1), so d0 is non-negative). Also, d0 must be \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo let's see:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1) must be \u2264 b -1.\n\nTherefore,\n\ns(b - s) \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\n=> s(b - s) \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nLet me rearrange:\n\ns(b - s) - (b -1)^2 \u22640\n\nLet me denote this as quadratic in s:\n\n-s^2 + b s - (b -1)^2 \u22640\n\nMultiply both sides by -1 (reverse inequality):\n\ns^2 - b s + (b -1)^2 \u22650\n\nLet me compute discriminant:\n\nD = b^2 - 4*(b -1)^2 = b^2 -4(b\u00b2 - 2b +1) = b\u00b2 -4b\u00b2 +8b -4 = -3b\u00b2 +8b -4\n\nHmm, discriminant of the quadratic equation s^2 -b s + (b-1)^2 =0. If discriminant is negative, then the quadratic is always positive (since coefficient of s\u00b2 is positive). Let me check discriminant D:\n\nD = -3b\u00b2 +8b -4\n\nSet to zero:\n\n-3b\u00b2 +8b -4 =0\n\nMultiply by -1:\n\n3b\u00b2 -8b +4 =0\n\nSolutions:\n\nb = [8 \u00b1 sqrt(64 -48)] /6 = [8 \u00b1 sqrt(16)] /6 = [8 \u00b14]/6\n\nThus, b=(8+4)/6=12/6=2, or b=(8-4)/6=4/6=2/3. Since b must be integer \u22652, so D=0 at b=2. For b>2, D becomes negative? Let me check for b=3:\n\nD= -3*(9) +8*3 -4= -27+24-4= -7 <0. So yes, for b\u22652, D is \u22640 except at b=2 where D=0. Therefore, for b\u22652, the quadratic s\u00b2 -b s + (b-1)^2 is always non-negative (since D\u22640), so the inequality s\u00b2 -b s + (b-1)^2 \u22650 is always true. Therefore, the inequality s(b -s) \u2264 (b-1)^2 is always true. Therefore, d0 is always \u2264 b-1. So the upper limit on d0 is automatically satisfied.\n\nTherefore, the constraints reduce to:\n\n1. s must be an integer between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b.\n\n2. s(b - s) must be divisible by (b-1).\n\n3. d0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1) must be an integer between 0 and b-1.\n\n4. d1 = s - d0 must be between 1 and b-1.\n\nBut since d0 is non-negative and s \u2264 b, then d1 = s - d0 \u2265 s - (b -1). Since s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)), so s - (b -1) could be negative? Wait, let's see. Let me see if d1 is at least 1.\n\nd1 = s - d0 = s - [s(b - s)/(b-1)]\n\nLet me compute that:\n\nd1 = [s(b -1) - s(b - s)] / (b -1)\n\nWait, let me compute numerator:\n\ns(b -1) - s(b - s) = s(b -1 - b + s) = s(s -1)\n\nTherefore,\n\nd1 = [s(s -1)]/(b -1)\n\nAh! So d1 = [s(s -1)]/(b -1). \n\nWait, so d1 must be an integer between 1 and b -1. So:\n\nd1 = [s(s -1)]/(b -1)\n\nTherefore, since d1 must be an integer, this requires that (b -1) divides s(s -1). Wait, but that was already our previous condition. So this is redundant. Therefore, once we have s such that (b -1) divides s(s -1), then d0 and d1 are automatically integers. But also, we need to ensure that d1 is between 1 and b -1.\n\nSo, given that d1 = [s(s -1)]/(b -1). Since s ranges from ceil(sqrt(b)) to b, let's see what d1 must be:\n\nSince s \u2265 ceil(sqrt(b)), and s \u2264 b.\n\nLet me see, for s = ceil(sqrt(b)), let's see:\n\nd1 = [s(s-1)]/(b-1). Since s is at least sqrt(b), so s^2 \u2248 b, so s(s-1) \u2248 b, so d1 \u2248 1. So maybe it's okay.\n\nAlternatively, let's see for s = b:\n\nd1 = [b(b -1)]/(b -1) = b. But since in base b, the first digit can be at most b-1, so d1 = b is invalid. Therefore, s = b would lead to d1 = b, which is invalid, so s = b is excluded. Therefore, actually s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nWait, so s can go up to b-1. Let me check:\n\nIf s = b, then d1 = [b(b-1)]/(b -1) = b, which is invalid as the first digit can't be b. Therefore, s must be at most b-1. Therefore, the upper bound is actually s_max = b -1.\n\nWait, but earlier when s is up to b, but s =b gives d1 =b, which is invalid, so the maximum s is b -1.\n\nTherefore, the valid range for s is ceil(sqrt(b)) \u2264 s \u2264 b -1.\n\nTherefore, the steps to compute the number of b-beautiful numbers for a given b are:\n\n1. For the given b, compute s_min = ceil( sqrt(b) ), s_max = b -1.\n\n2. For each integer s from s_min to s_max:\n\n   a. Check if (b -1) divides s(s -1).\n\n   b. If yes, compute d0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1).\n\n   c. Check if d0 is between 0 and b -1 (which it should be as we saw earlier).\n\n   d. Compute d1 = s - d0 = [s(s -1)]/(b -1).\n\n   e. Check if d1 is between 1 and b -1.\n\n   f. If all conditions met, then this s corresponds to a valid b-beautiful number n = d1*b + d0 = s^2.\n\nTherefore, the count is the number of s in s_min to s_max where the above conditions hold.\n\nAlternatively, since d1 must be between 1 and b-1, let me see if that adds any additional constraints. Since d1 = [s(s-1)]/(b -1). We need 1 \u2264 [s(s-1)]/(b -1) \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo,\n\n1 \u2264 s(s -1)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nMultiply all terms by (b -1):\n\nb -1 \u2264 s(s -1) \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nHmm, so s(s -1) must be between b -1 and (b -1)^2.\n\nBut since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, let's see:\n\nThe minimal s is ceil(sqrt(b)), so s(s-1) is at least ceil(sqrt(b))*(ceil(sqrt(b)) -1). For example, if b is a square, say b = m\u00b2, then ceil(sqrt(b))=m, so s(s-1)=m(m-1). The minimal s(s-1) would be m(m-1). The maximum s(s-1) is (b -1)(b -2).\n\nBut maybe this is not necessary. Let's proceed.\n\nTherefore, the key condition is that (b -1) divides s(s -1). So for each b, the number of s between s_min and s_max where s(s -1) is divisible by (b -1).\n\nHence, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that s \u22610 mod (b -1) or s \u22611 mod (b -1). Wait, but s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, then (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. Because since their GCD is 1, the factors must divide separately.\n\nAh! That's a crucial point. Since s and s-1 are coprime, the fact that (b-1) divides their product implies that (b-1) divides s or (b-1) divides (s -1). Because if two coprime numbers multiply to a multiple of N, then each must divide N. Wait, actually, more precisely, since GCD(s, s-1)=1, then (b-1) must divide s or (b-1) must divide (s -1). Because any prime divisor of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1, but not both. Since they are coprime, so the entire (b-1) must divide one of them.\n\nTherefore, the condition s(s-1) divisible by (b-1) is equivalent to (b-1 divides s) or (b-1 divides (s-1)).\n\nTherefore, s \u22610 mod (b-1) or s\u22611 mod (b-1).\n\nTherefore, the possible s must be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo (b-1). But s is in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1].\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that s \u22610 or 1 mod (b-1).\n\nBut since mod (b-1), the residues 0 and 1 can only be achieved in the range [1, b-1]. Since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, so the possible s's that are \u22610 mod (b-1) must be s = b-1 (since 0 mod (b-1) in that interval is only b-1 if b-1 divides b-1, which it does). Wait, s= b-1 is \u22610 mod (b-1). Similarly, s \u22611 mod (b-1) would be s=1 +k*(b-1). But since s must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)), let's see:\n\nPossible s \u22610 mod (b-1): only s = b-1 (since 0 mod (b-1) in 1..b-1 is only b-1). Wait, but actually, 0 mod (b-1) is equivalent to s = m*(b-1). The only s in 1..b-1 is s=b-1 when m=1.\n\nSimilarly, s\u22611 mod (b-1): the numbers congruent to 1 mod (b-1) in [1, b-1] is s=1. Because 1 mod (b-1) is 1, and adding (b-1) would get to b, which is beyond the upper limit of b-1. So the only s \u22611 mod (b-1) in that interval is s=1.\n\nWait, but s has to be at least ceil(sqrt(b)). So unless ceil(sqrt(b)) \u22641, which only occurs when b=1 or 2. Since b \u22652, ceil(sqrt(2))=2. Therefore, for b\u22652, s=1 is below the minimum s_min=ceil(sqrt(b)) except when b=2, but for b=2, s_min=2, so s=1 is still below. Therefore, actually, there are no solutions from s\u22611 mod (b-1) except when s=1 is within the interval, which it isn't for b\u22652.\n\nWait, so does that mean that the only possible s that satisfy the congruence are s = b-1 (for s\u22610 mod (b-1)) and s=1 (which is too low). Hence, only s = b-1?\n\nWait, but that can't be, because in the earlier example with b=13, 81 is 63 in base 13. Let's check for b=13.\n\nFor b=13, s_min = ceil(sqrt(13))=4, s_max=12.\n\nLooking for s in 4 to 12 where s \u22610 or 1 mod 12 (since b-1=12). So s\u22610 mod12: s=12. s\u22611 mod12: s=1, which is too low. So only s=12.\n\nBut in the example given, 81 is 63 in base 13, so s=6+3=9. Wait, but according to this, only s=12 would be valid. But the example uses s=9, so this suggests a problem with my reasoning.\n\nWait, there's an error here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the problem statement, the example given is 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 is 63 in base 13, and 6+3=9= sqrt(81). So s=9, which is not congruent to 0 or1 mod12 (since 9 mod12 is 9). So my previous conclusion must be wrong.\n\nHmm, so my mistake was in assuming that since s and s-1 are coprime, (b-1) must divide s or s-1. But actually, that's only if (b-1) is square-free. Wait, no, actually, even if (b-1) has repeated prime factors, the condition is still that the prime factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. However, if (b-1) has a square factor, say p\u00b2 divides (b-1), then p must divide either s or s-1, but not both, so p\u00b2 could divide one of them. So the conclusion that (b-1) divides s or (b-1) divides s-1 is only true when (b-1) is square-free?\n\nWait, perhaps my mistake was in the logic. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose that (b-1) divides s(s-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, then any prime power dividing (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. So, for each prime power p^k dividing (b-1), p^k divides s or p^k divides (s-1). Therefore, (b-1) can be written as a product of factors, each of which divides s or divides (s-1). However, it's not necessary that the entire (b-1) divides s or divides (s-1). It can be split between s and s-1. For example, in the case of b=13, b-1=12=3\u00d74. So 3 divides s or s-1, and 4 divides s or s-1. So for s=9:\n\nCheck 12 divides s(s-1)=9\u00d78=72. 72/12=6, so yes. So 12 divides 72. \n\nNow, 3 divides 9, and 4 divides 8. So the factors 3 and 4 are split between s and s-1, hence their product divides the product s(s-1). So the condition is satisfied even if neither 12 divides s nor 12 divides s-1. Therefore, my previous conclusion was incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is that (b-1) divides s(s-1), but s does not have to be congruent to 0 or 1 modulo (b-1). Instead, it's a more general condition. Therefore, my earlier approach of testing each s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 for divisibility is necessary.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the only way is to find for each b the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). To find when this count exceeds 10, we need to find the minimal b where this happens.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can find for each b the number of solutions s by noting that s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). So the number of solutions s in that interval is equal to the number of solutions to s \u22610 or 1 mod d, where d divides (b-1). Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). Let me denote m = b-1. So m divides s(s-1). The number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides s(s-1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given m, the number of s between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m where s(s-1) \u22610 mod m.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for m = b-1, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] with s(s-1) \u22610 mod m.\n\nThis seems difficult. Maybe we can think in terms of divisors.\n\nSuppose m = (b-1). Let me think of the equation s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod e, where d*e divides m? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, note that s(s-1) \u22610 mod m implies that s \u22610 mod gcd(m, s) and s \u22611 mod gcd(m, s-1). Hmm, perhaps not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that for s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m], the number of s where m divides s(s-1). Let me see for m =12 (b=13):\n\nWe need s in [4, 12], find s where 12 divides s(s-1). Let's check each s from 4 to 12:\n\ns=4: 4\u00d73=12 \u219212 divides 12 \u2192 yes. So s=4 is valid.\n\ns=5:5\u00d74=20 \u219220 mod12=8 \u2192 no.\n\ns=6:6\u00d75=30 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\ns=7:7\u00d76=42 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\ns=8:8\u00d77=56 mod12= 56-48=8 \u2192 no.\n\ns=9:9\u00d78=72 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\ns=10:10\u00d79=90 mod12= 90-72=18 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\ns=11:11\u00d710=110 mod12: 110-96=14 mod12=2 \u2192 no.\n\ns=12:12\u00d711=132 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo for m=12 (b=13), s=4,9,12 are valid. So three solutions. Which matches the example given (s=9 is one of them, so there are three numbers, including the example). So in the problem statement, 81 is one of them. So for b=13, there are 3 b-beautiful numbers, which is less than 10.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with b=13:\n\ns=4:\n\nd0 = [4*(13 -4)]/(12)= (4*9)/12= 36/12=3. So d0=3, d1=4-3=1. Then n=1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4, which matches. So 16 is another.\n\ns=9: as given.\n\ns=12:\n\nd0 = [12*(13-12)]/12 = (12*1)/12=1. d1=12 -1=11. So n=11*13 +1=143. sqrt(143)\u224811.96, which is not integer. Wait a second, this is a problem.\n\nWait, hold on, sqrt(143) is not 12? 12^2=144. So n=143, which is not 12\u00b2. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, there's a mistake here. If s=12, then n should be s\u00b2=144. Let me check the calculation again:\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1) = [12*(13 -12)]/(12) = (12*1)/12=1. So d0=1, d1=12 -1=11. Then n=11*13 +1= 143. But 143 is not 12 squared. So discrepancy here.\n\nWait, so my mistake must be in the equation. Let me re-examine.\n\nWe have the equation:\n\ns^2 = d1*b + d0\n\nBut we also have:\n\nd1 + d0 = s\n\nThus, substituting d1 = s - d0,\n\ns^2 = (s - d0)*b + d0\n\nThen rearranged,\n\ns^2 = s*b - d0*b + d0\n\nThen,\n\nd0*(b -1) = s*b - s^2\n\nSo,\n\nd0 = [s(b - s)]/(b -1)\n\nTherefore, in the case of s=12, b=13:\n\nd0 = [12*(13 -12)]/(13 -1) = [12*1]/12 =1. So d0=1, d1 =12 -1=11. Then n = d1*b +d0 =11*13 +1=143. However, s=12, so s squared is 144. So discrepancy of 1. Wait, this suggests an error in the derivation.\n\nWait, where is the mistake? Let me retrace.\n\nWe started with:\n\nd1 + d0 = sqrt(n) = s\n\nand n = d1*b +d0 = s^2.\n\nTherefore,\n\nd1*b +d0 = s^2.\n\nBut d1 = s - d0,\n\nSo substituting:\n\n(s - d0)*b + d0 = s^2\n\nExpanding:\n\ns*b - d0*b +d0 = s^2\n\nRearranged:\n\ns*b - s^2 = d0*(b -1)\n\nThus,\n\nd0 = (s*b - s^2)/(b -1) = [s(b - s)]/(b -1). Wait, that's correct.\n\nBut then, if we compute n = d1*b +d0,\n\nwith d1 = s -d0,\n\nthen,\n\nn = (s -d0)*b +d0 = s*b -d0*b +d0 = s*b - d0*(b -1).\n\nBut from the previous equation, d0*(b -1) = s*b - s^2,\n\nThus,\n\nn = s*b - (s*b - s^2) = s\u00b2. Correct.\n\nSo in the case of s=12, b=13,\n\nn should be 12\u00b2=144, but calculation gives 143. Contradiction. So where is the mistake?\n\nWait, let's compute d1 and d0 again:\n\nd0 = [12*(13 -12)]/12 =1, so d0=1.\n\nd1 =12 -1=11. Then n =11*13 +1 = 143 +1? Wait 11*13 is 143, plus 1 is 144. Oh! Wait, 11*13 is 143, plus d0=1 gives 144. Yes, my mistake in arithmetic earlier. So n=144, which is 12\u00b2. So that works.\n\nPhew, okay, so s=12 is valid. So three solutions for b=13.\n\nSo that works.\n\nSo the process is correct.\n\nTherefore, to proceed, perhaps I need to find for each b, the number of s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 where s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). Since doing this manually is tedious, perhaps look for a pattern or formula.\n\nAlternatively, note that s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so coprime. Therefore, for their product to be divisible by m = b-1, m must divide the product of two coprimes. Therefore, m can be factored into two coprime parts, m1 and m2, such that m1 divides s and m2 divides s-1. Since m1 and m2 are coprime, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to split m into coprime factors m1 and m2, and then solve s \u22610 mod m1 and s\u22611 mod m2. The number of solutions would then be the number of such factorizations.\n\nHowever, the number of solutions would depend on the number of divisors of m, but this might be complex.\n\nAlternatively, note that for each divisor d of m = b-1, we can set s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod m/d, provided that d and m/d are coprime. The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that such s exists uniquely modulo m. The number of such divisors d where gcd(d, m/d)=1 would give the number of solutions. But this is getting too abstract.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of m = b-1. The number of s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod (m/d) for some divisor d of m. Hmm, not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe notice that the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m = b-1. Because for each divisor d of m, setting s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod (m/d), but this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of divisors of m = b-1. Let me test with the example m=12 (b=13):\n\nThe divisors of 12 are 1,2,3,4,6,12. The number of solutions was 3 (s=4,9,12). Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m where d divides s and m/d divides s-1. Since s must be in the interval, the number of such s would be the number of such d. For m=12:\n\nPossible d's dividing 12:\n\nTake d=1: need s \u22610 mod1 (always true) and s\u22611 mod12. So s=1 mod12. In [4,12], s=1 is too low, s=13 is outside. So no solution here.\n\nd=2: s\u22610 mod2, s\u22611 mod6 (since 12/2=6). So s must be even and \u22611 mod6. So s\u22614 mod6 (since 1 mod6 even is 4 mod6). So s=4,10 in [4,12]. Check:\n\ns=4: yes, 4 mod6 is 4\u22611 mod6? 4 mod6 is 4, which is not 1. Wait, maybe my approach is flawed.\n\nWait, if d=2 divides s, so s even, and m/d=6 divides s-1. So s-1 must be divisible by 6. Thus s=1 mod6. So s must be even and \u22611 mod6. So s= (6k +1) even. Let me see:\n\n6k +1 even \u2192 6k must be odd, which is impossible. So no solution here.\n\nHmm.\n\nd=3: s\u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod4 (since 12/3=4). So s \u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\nFind s in [4,12].\n\nLet me list numbers \u22611 mod4: 5,9,13. Among these, divisible by 3: 9. So s=9.\n\nd=4: s\u22610 mod4, s\u22611 mod3 (since 12/4=3). So s divisible by4, and \u22611 mod3.\n\nNumbers divisible by4 in [4,12]:4,8,12.\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n4 mod3=1 \u2192 yes, so 4 is okay.\n\n8 mod3=2 \u2192 no.\n\n12 mod3=0 \u2192 no. So s=4.\n\nd=6: s\u22610 mod6, s\u22611 mod2 (since 12/6=2). So s divisible by6, and s\u22611 mod2. But divisible by6 implies even, so s\u22610 mod2. Contradiction. So no solution.\n\nd=12: s\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod1. The second condition is always true. So s\u22610 mod12. Thus s=12. Which is valid.\n\nThus total solutions from divisors d=3,4,12 give s=9,4,12. So three solutions, which matches the example. So the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m where the congruence conditions can be satisfied, leading to s in the required interval. Each divisor d gives at most one solution. So the number of solutions is equal to the number of such valid divisors d.\n\nThus, the number of solutions for m is equal to the number of divisors d of m such that the congruence conditions have a solution s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m].\n\nTherefore, to compute the number of solutions for a given m = b-1:\n\n1. Find all divisors d of m.\n\n2. For each divisor d of m, compute the required congruence s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (m/d). If such s exists and lies in the interval [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m], then count it.\n\n3. The total number is the number of such valid divisors d.\n\nAlternatively, this is getting too involved. Maybe it's better to write a table for m from 1 upwards (since b starts at 2, m starts at 1):\n\nBut since this is a thought process, let me try to find the minimal m (so minimal b=m+1) where the number of solutions exceeds 10.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps look for m where m has many divisors. Since the number of solutions is related to the number of divisors, maybe when m is highly composite, like 12, 24, 60, etc., the number of solutions would be higher.\n\nLet me try m=24 (so b=25). Let's compute the number of solutions:\n\nm=24, so b=25. The interval for s is ceil(sqrt(25))=5 to 24.\n\nWe need to find s in [5,24] such that 24 divides s(s-1).\n\nLet me compute s(s-1) mod24=0.\n\nPossible s:\n\ns must be such that 24 divides s(s-1). Since 24=8\u00d73.\n\nThus, s(s-1) must be divisible by 8 and 3.\n\nDivisible by 3: Either s \u22610 mod3 or s\u22611 mod3.\n\nDivisible by 8: Either s \u22610 mod8 or s\u22611 mod8 (since s and s-1 are consecutive, so one of them must be even, but to get divisibility by 8, one of them must be divisible by 8 or both divisible by 2 and 4? Wait, need s(s-1) divisible by 8. Since s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even. The even one must be divisible by 8, or the even one divisible by 4 and the other even? Let me think:\n\nTo have s(s-1) divisible by 8, since they are consecutive:\n\nEither the even one is divisible by 8, or the even one is divisible by 4 and the other is even (but they are consecutive, so only one is even). Wait:\n\nWait, in two consecutive numbers, exactly one is even. Let me denote:\n\nIf s is even, then s must be divisible by 8, or s divisible by 4 and s-1 divisible by 2 (but s-1 is odd, so no). Wait, no, that won't help. Alternatively:\n\nThe even number must be divisible by 8, because if it's divisible by 4 but not 8, then the other is odd, so the total would only have 2\u00d74=8? Wait:\n\nLet me think:\n\nSuppose s is even:\n\nLet s =2k. Then s-1 is odd. Then s(s-1)=2k*(2k -1). To have this divisible by 8, 2k must be divisible by 8, so k divisible by 4. Thus s divisible by 8.\n\nSimilarly, if s is odd, then s-1 is even. Let s-1=2k, so s=2k+1. Then s(s-1)=(2k+1)(2k). To be divisible by 8, 2k must be divisible by 8 (so k divisible by4) or 2k divisible by 4 and 2k+1 even (which it isn't). So 2k divisible by 8, so k divisible by4. Thus s-1 divisible by8. Therefore, in either case, the even number among s and s-1 must be divisible by8.\n\nTherefore, the condition reduces to s \u22610 mod8 or s\u22611 mod8.\n\nAdditionally, must also be divisible by3. So combining:\n\nWe need s \u22610 mod3 or 1 mod3,\n\nAND\n\ns \u22610 mod8 or 1 mod8.\n\nSo we can consider four cases:\n\n1. s\u22610 mod8 and s\u22610 mod3: s\u22610 mod lcm(8,3)=24 \u2192 s=24.\n\n2. s\u22610 mod8 and s\u22611 mod3:\n\nFind s \u22610 mod8 and 1 mod3.\n\nLet s=8k. Then 8k\u22611 mod3 \u2192 8\u22612 mod3 \u21d2 2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2 k\u22612 mod3. Thus s=8*(3m +2)=24m +16.\n\nWithin [5,24], s=16, 40,\u2026 but 40>24. So s=16.\n\n3. s\u22611 mod8 and s\u22610 mod3:\n\ns=8k +1. Then 8k+1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d28k \u2261-1 mod3 \u21d22k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3. Thus s=8*(3m+1)+1=24m +9.\n\nWithin [5,24], s=9, 33,\u2026 so s=9.\n\n4. s\u22611 mod8 and s\u22611 mod3:\n\ns=8k+1\u22611 mod3 \u21d28k\u22610 mod3 \u21d22k\u22610 mod3 \u21d2k\u22610 mod3. So s=8*(3m)+1=24m +1. Within [5,24], s=1,25,\u2026 so s=1 is too low, 25 is over. So none.\n\nThus the solutions are s=24,16,9.\n\nWait, but also need to check divisibility by3 and 8:\n\nWait, but let me check each s in [5,24] which are \u22610 or1 mod8 and \u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nWait, but the above method gives s=9,16,24.\n\nCheck each:\n\ns=9:\n\n9 mod8=1, 9 mod3=0 \u2192 satisfies case3 (1 mod8 and 0 mod3). So yes.\n\ns=16:\n\n16 mod8=0, 16 mod3=1 \u2192 case2 (0 mod8 and 1 mod3). Yes.\n\ns=24:\n\n24 mod8=0, mod3=0 \u2192 case1. Yes.\n\nAdditionally, let me check if there are other solutions:\n\nCheck s= 8 mod24? But 8 is in the interval.\n\nWait s=8:\n\nCheck s=8: 8 mod8=0, mod3=2. So not in any of the cases above.\n\ns=8: s(s-1)=8\u00d77=56. 56 mod24=8. Not 0. So no.\n\ns=1: too low.\n\ns= 24: yes.\n\nWait, s= 24 is in the interval [5,24].\n\nWait, what about s= 17? Let me check s=17:\n\n17 mod8=1, mod3=2. So not in cases.\n\n17\u00d716=272. 272 mod24= 272 -11\u00d724=272-264=8 \u22600.\n\ns= 25 is over.\n\nWait, maybe there are more solutions?\n\nWait, let me try s= 21:\n\ns=21 mod8=5, mod3=0. Not in cases.\n\n21\u00d720=420. 420 mod24=420-17\u00d724=420-408=12\u22600.\n\ns= 12:\n\n12 mod8=4, mod3=0. Not in cases.\n\n12\u00d711=132 mod24=132-5\u00d724=132-120=12\u22600.\n\nHmm, so only 9,16,24. So three solutions. So m=24 (b=25) only has three solutions. Not enough.\n\nHmm, perhaps m=60 (b=61). That might take too long.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider m= 240 (b=241). Maybe overkill.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m= 60 (b=61). Let me try m=60 (b=61):\n\ns must be between ceil(sqrt(61))=8 and 60.\n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by60.\n\n60 factors into 4\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nTherefore, s(s-1) must be divisible by4,3,5.\n\nDivisible by4: as before, either s\u22610 mod8 or s\u22611 mod8 (since similar to before, the even term must be divisible by4).\n\nWait, actually, to be divisible by4:\n\nEither s divisible by4 or s-1 divisible by4. Since s and s-1 are consecutive, only one is even. The even one must be divisible by4.\n\nSimilarly, divisible by3: s\u22610 or1 mod3.\n\nDivisible by5: s\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, need to satisfy:\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod4 (Wait, actually, for divisibility by4:\n\nEither s is even and divisible by4, or s-1 divisible by4 (if s is odd). Wait, similar to the previous logic.\n\nWait, let me think again:\n\nTo have s(s-1) divisible by4:\n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive, exactly one is even. Let the even one be divisible by4. So:\n\nIf s is even, then s divisible by4,\n\nIf s is odd, then s-1 divisible by4 (so s \u22611 mod4).\n\nThus, s \u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4.\n\nWait, more precisely, s \u22610 mod4 or s\u22611 mod4.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait, if s even: s divisible by4 \u2192 s\u22610 mod4,\n\nIf s odd: s-1 divisible by4 \u2192 s\u22611 mod4.\n\nThus, overall, s \u22610 or1 mod4.\n\nSimilarly, mod3:\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod3,\n\nmod5:\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nTherefore, combining all these conditions, the solutions must satisfy:\n\ns \u22610 or1 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod5,\n\nand s in [8,60].\n\nThe number of solutions would be the number of s in that interval satisfying all three.\n\nThis is getting complex, but perhaps manageable.\n\nTo count the number of s in [8,60] that are \u22610 or1 mod4, mod3, mod5.\n\nAlternatively, the conditions can be combined using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nWe can consider all combinations of residues:\n\nFor mod4: 0 or1,\n\nmod3:0 or1,\n\nmod5:0 or1.\n\nEach combination gives a system of congruences.\n\nThere are 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 possible combinations.\n\nFor each combination, solve the system:\n\ns \u2261 a mod4,\n\ns\u2261b mod3,\n\ns\u2261c mod5,\n\nwhere a \u2208{0,1}, b\u2208{0,1}, c\u2208{0,1}.\n\nFor each of the 8 combinations, find the solutions s in [8,60], then count them.\n\nThis is tedious but possible.\n\nLet me start with one combination:\n\nCase1: a=0 mod4, b=0 mod3, c=0 mod5.\n\nFind s \u22610 mod4, 0 mod3,0 mod5.\n\nThus s\u22610 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60. So s=60k. In [8,60], s=60.\n\nCase2: a=0 mod4, b=0 mod3, c=1 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod4, 0 mod3,1 mod5.\n\nLet me solve:\n\ns \u22610 mod12 (lcm(4,3)=12),\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet s=12m. Then 12m \u22611 mod5 \u21d2 12m \u22612m \u22611 mod5 \u21d22m\u22611 mod5 \u21d2m\u22613 mod5 (since 2\u00d73=6\u22611 mod5).\n\nThus m=5n+3. Then s=12*(5n+3)=60n +36.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0 gives s=36, n=1 gives 96>60. So s=36.\n\nCase3: a=0 mod4, b=1 mod3, c=0 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod4, 1 mod3,0 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod20 (lcm(4,5)=20),\n\ns\u22611 mod3.\n\nLet s=20k. 20k \u22611 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k \u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3.\n\nThus k=3n+2. s=20*(3n+2)=60n +40.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0 gives s=40, n=1 gives 100>60. So s=40.\n\nCase4: a=0 mod4, b=1 mod3, c=1 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nLet me combine mod3 and mod5 first.\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod15 (lcm(3,5)=15).\n\nThus s=15k+1.\n\nAlso s\u22610 mod4 \u21d215k+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d23k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4.\n\nThus k=4n+1. Thus s=15*(4n+1)+1=60n +16.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0: 16, n=1:76>60. So s=16.\n\nCase5: a=1 mod4, b=0 mod3, c=0 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4, 0 mod3,0 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 mod15 (lcm(3,5)=15).\n\nLet s=15k. 15k \u22611 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2k\u22613 mod4.\n\nThus k=4n+3. s=15*(4n+3)=60n +45.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0 gives45, n=1 gives105>60. So s=45.\n\nCase6: a=1 mod4, b=0 mod3, c=1 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,0 mod3,1 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5.\n\nFirst combine mod3 and mod5:\n\ns\u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22616 mod15 (since 6 mod3=0,6 mod5=1).\n\nThus s=15k+6.\n\nAlso s\u22611 mod4 \u21d215k+6 \u22611 mod4 \u21d215k \u2261-5 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k \u2261-5 mod4 \u21d23k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4.\n\nThus k=4n+1. s=15*(4n+1)+6=60n +21.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0 gives21, n=1 gives81>60. So s=21.\n\nCase7: a=1 mod4, b=1 mod3, c=0 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,1 mod3,0 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,\n\ns\u22611 mod3,\n\ns\u22610 mod5.\n\nCombine mod3 and mod4 first:\n\ns\u22611 mod12 (lcm(3,4)=12).\n\nAlso s\u22610 mod5.\n\nThus s\u226112k +1.\n\nWait, no:\n\nWait s\u22611 mod4 and 1 mod3 \u21d2s\u22611 mod12,\n\nand s\u22610 mod5.\n\nLet me write s=12m +1. Then 12m +1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d212m \u2261-1 mod5 \u21d212\u22612 mod5 \u21d22m \u2261-1 mod5 \u21d22m\u22614 mod5 \u21d2m\u22612 mod5.\n\nThus m=5n+2. s=12*(5n+2)+1=60n +25.\n\nWithin [8,60], n=0 gives25, n=1 gives85>60. So s=25.\n\nCase8: a=1 mod4, b=1 mod3, c=1 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod4,1 mod3,1 mod5.\n\ns\u22611 mod lcm(4,3,5)=60. So s\u22611 mod60. In [8,60], s=61 is over, so no solution.\n\nThus total solutions from all cases:\n\nCase1:60,\n\nCase2:36,\n\nCase3:40,\n\nCase4:16,\n\nCase5:45,\n\nCase6:21,\n\nCase7:25,\n\nCase8: none.\n\nThus total solutions are 7 values:16,21,25,36,40,45,60. So seven solutions.\n\nWait, but let me check each:\n\nCheck s=16:\n\n16 mod4=0, mod3=1 (16/3=5 rem1), mod5=1 (16 mod5=1). So yes, case4.\n\ns=21: mod4=1 (21 mod4=1), mod3=0 (21/3=7), mod5=1. So case6.\n\nWait, 21 mod3 is 0, mod5=1. So case6 is correct.\n\ns=25 mod4=1, mod3=1 (25 mod3=1), mod5=0. So case7.\n\nYes, case7.\n\ns=36 mod4=0 (36 mod4=0), mod3=0 (36 mod3=0), mod5=1 (36 mod5=1). So case2.\n\ns=40 mod4=0, mod3=1 (40 mod3=1), mod5=0. case3.\n\ns=45 mod4=1 (45 mod4=1), mod3=0, mod5=0. case5.\n\ns=60 mod4=0, mod3=0, mod5=0. case1.\n\nSo total seven solutions. Thus for m=60 (b=61), there are seven b-beautiful numbers. Still under 10.\n\nHmm, perhaps m needs to be larger.\n\nWait, maybe m= 120 (b=121). Let me see:\n\nBut this might take too long. Alternatively, maybe I need to find a better approach.\n\nLet me think of the number of solutions s for m = b-1. The number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m where the congruence conditions can be satisfied, as before. However, the exact count requires checking.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps when m is a factorial number, like 12! but that's too big. Alternatively, m being a highly composite number.\n\nAlternatively, note that in the previous examples, m=12 (b=13) had 3 solutions, m=24 (b=25) had 3 solutions, m=60 (b=61) had 7 solutions. Maybe when m is 240, but this is time-consuming.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for m where the number of solutions is more than 10. Let me see if m= 240 (b=241):\n\nBut this is going to take a while. Alternatively, perhaps think of m= 2520 (the least common multiple of 1-8), but that's too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m= 252 (b=253). Let me try m=252 (b=253):\n\nThe number of solutions would be the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(253))=16, 252] such that s(s-1) divisible by252.\n\n252 factors into 4\u00d79\u00d77. So divisible by 4, 9,7.\n\nThus, s(s-1) divisible by 4,9,7.\n\nDivisible by4: s\u22610 or1 mod4,\n\nDivisible by9: s\u22610 or1 mod9,\n\nDivisible by7: s\u22610 or1 mod7.\n\nSo need to satisfy s\u22610 or1 mod4, mod9, mod7.\n\nThis is going to have many combinations. The number of solutions would be 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 possibilities for residues mod4, mod9, mod7. Each combination would give a solution if it exists in the interval.\n\nThis could give up to 8 solutions, but perhaps more due to overlapping conditions. However, even 8 is less than 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe m= 120 (b=121):\n\nm=120, factors 8\u00d73\u00d75.\n\nDivisible by8,3,5.\n\nThus:\n\nDivisible by8:\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod8,\n\nDivisible by3:\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod3,\n\nDivisible by5:\n\ns\u22610 or1 mod5.\n\nThus, 2\u00d72\u00d72=8 combinations.\n\nEach combination gives a system of congruences. Let me try:\n\nTake a=0 mod8, b=0 mod3, c=0 mod5:\n\ns\u22610 mod lcm(8,3,5)=120 \u2192 s=120.\n\nWithin [11,120], so s=120.\n\nAnother combination:\n\na=0 mod8, b=0 mod3, c=1 mod5:\n\ns\u22610 mod24 (lcm(8,3)=24),\n\nand s\u22611 mod5.\n\n24m \u22611 mod5 \u21d224\u22614 mod5 \u21d24m\u22611 mod5 \u21d2m\u22614 mod5.\n\nThus m=5k+4. s=24*(5k+4)=120k +96.\n\nWithin [11,120], k=0 gives96, k=1 gives216>120. So s=96.\n\nContinuing this way, each combination may give one solution, so 8 solutions. Plus possibly more?\n\nWait, maybe some combinations allow multiple solutions within the interval.\n\nAlternatively, total of 8 solutions for m=120. Not enough.\n\nHmm, this is taking too long. Maybe I need a different approach.\n\nWait, let's think of s(s-1) divisible by m =b-1.\n\nThe equation s(s-1) \u22610 mod m.\n\nThe number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] is equal to the number of integers s in that interval where s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod (m/d) for some divisor d of m.\n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m such that there exists s in the interval with s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod (m/d).\n\nEach divisor d gives a possible solution if the congruence has a solution in the interval.\n\nThe total number is the number of such divisors d where the congruence has a solution in the interval.\n\nTo maximize this number, m should have many divisors. So the number of solutions is roughly proportional to the number of divisors of m. Therefore, to get over 10 solutions, m must have over 10 divisors.\n\nThe number of divisors function d(m) grows with m's factors. The first m with d(m) >10 are m=24 (d=8), m=30 (d=8), m=36 (d=9), m=40 (d=8), m=48 (d=10), m=60 (d=12). \n\nAh, m=60 has 12 divisors. Let's check m=60 again. Earlier count gave 7 solutions, but maybe my count was wrong.\n\nWait, m=60, b=61, the interval is [8,60].\n\nThe divisors of60 are 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30,60.\n\nLet me try the divisor approach again:\n\nFor each divisor d of60, set s \u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (60/d).\n\nFind s in [8,60].\n\nFor example:\n\nd=1: s\u22610 mod1 (always true), s\u22611 mod60. s=1 mod60 \u2192 s=1,61,\u2026 so only s=61 is outside. No solution in [8,60].\n\nd=2: s\u22610 mod2, s\u22611 mod30.\n\ns must be even and s\u22611 mod30 \u2192 s=30k+1 even. 30k+1 even \u21d230k must be odd, impossible. No solution.\n\nd=3: s\u22610 mod3, s\u22611 mod20.\n\nFind s \u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod20.\n\nLet s=20k+1. 20k+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d220k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3.\n\nThus k=3m+1. s=20*(3m+1)+1=60m +21.\n\nWithin [8,60], m=0 gives21, m=1 gives81>60. So s=21.\n\nd=4: s\u22610 mod4, s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\nLet s=15k+1. 15k+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4.\n\nThus k=4m+1. s=15*(4m+1)+1=60m +16.\n\nWithin [8,60], m=0 gives16, m=1 gives76>60. So s=16.\n\nd=5: s\u22610 mod5, s\u22611 mod12.\n\ns\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod12.\n\ns=12k+1. 12k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d212k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d212\u22612 mod5 \u21d22k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k\u22612 mod5.\n\nThus k=5m+2. s=12*(5m+2)+1=60m +25.\n\nWithin interval: m=0 gives25, m=1 gives85>60. So s=25.\n\nd=6: s\u22610 mod6, s\u22611 mod10.\n\ns\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod10.\n\ns=10k+1. 10k+1\u22610 mod6 \u21d210k\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d210\u22614 mod6 \u21d24k\u22615 mod6 \u21d24k\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d24k\u22615 mod6.\n\n4k mod6=5 \u21d2 possible?\n\n4k mod6 can be 0,4,2,0,4,2,... never 5. So no solution.\n\nd=10: s\u22610 mod10, s\u22611 mod6.\n\ns\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod6.\n\ns=10k. 10k\u22611 mod6 \u21d210k\u22614k \u22611 mod6 \u21d24k\u22611 mod6 \u21d2 multiply both sides by inverse of4 mod6. But gcd(4,6)=2, which doesn't divide1, so no solution.\n\nd=12: s\u22610 mod12, s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns=12k. 12k\u22611 mod5 \u21d212k\u22612k\u22611 mod5 \u21d22k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22613 mod5.\n\nk=5m+3. s=12*(5m+3)=60m+36.\n\nWithin interval: m=0 gives36, m=1 gives96>60. So s=36.\n\nd=15: s\u22610 mod15, s\u22611 mod4.\n\ns\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\ns=15k. 15k\u22611 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2k\u22613 mod4.\n\nk=4m+3. s=15*(4m+3)=60m+45.\n\nWithin interval: m=0 gives45, m=1 gives105>60. So s=45.\n\nd=20: s\u22610 mod20, s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns\u22610 mod20 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=20k. 20k\u22611 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3.\n\nk=3m+2. s=20*(3m+2)=60m+40.\n\nWithin interval: m=0 gives40, m=1 gives100>60. So s=40.\n\nd=30: s\u22610 mod30, s\u22611 mod2.\n\ns\u22610 mod30 and s\u22611 mod2. Since 30 is even, s=30k is even, but must be \u22611 mod2 (odd). Contradiction. No solution.\n\nd=60: s\u22610 mod60, s\u22611 mod1. The second congruence is always true. Thus s=60. Which is in the interval.\n\nThus total solutions from each divisor d are s=21,16,25,36,45,40,60. That's seven solutions, as before. So my previous count was correct.\n\nHmm. So m=60 gives seven solutions. Need to find m where the number of solutions exceeds 10.\n\nLet me try m= 240 (b=241). Let me see how many divisors it has.\n\n240 factors as 2^4\u00d73\u00d75. The number of divisors is (4+1)(1+1)(1+1)=5\u00d72\u00d72=20 divisors.\n\nPerhaps this will give more solutions.\n\nBut this is getting too time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe m= 360 (b=361):\n\n360 factors into 2^3\u00d73^2\u00d75. Divisors count: (3+1)(2+1)(1+1)=4\u00d73\u00d72=24.\n\nBut even this might take a while.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m= 840 (b=841):\n\n840=2^3\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77. Divisors count: (3+1)(1+1)(1+1)(1+1)=4\u00d72\u00d72\u00d72=32.\n\nBut this is getting too big.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal b is 121 (m=120) but we saw it gives 8 solutions.\n\nWait, perhaps m= 120 (divisors count 16) gives more?\n\nWait let's try m= 240 (b=241). Let's try a few of its divisors.\n\nTake d= 16 (divisor of 240):\n\nd=16: s\u22610 mod16, s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns=15k+1. 15k+1\u22610 mod16 \u21d215k \u2261-1 mod16 \u21d215\u2261-1 mod16 \u21d2-k\u2261-1 mod16 \u21d2k\u22611 mod16.\n\nThus k=16m+1. s=15*(16m+1)+1=240m +16.\n\nWithin [16,240], m=0 gives16, m=1 gives256.\n\ns=256 is within [16,240]? 240 is the upper limit, so 256 exceeds.\n\nThus only s=16.\n\nAnother divisor d= 5:\n\nd=5: s\u22610 mod5, s\u22611 mod48.\n\ns=48k+1. 48k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d248k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d248\u22613 mod5 \u21d23k\u22614 mod5 \u21d23k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d2k\u22613 mod5 (since 3\u00d73=9\u2261-1).\n\nk=5m+3. s=48*(5m+3)+1=240m +145.\n\nWithin [16,240], m=0 gives145, m=1 gives385>240. So s=145.\n\nSimilarly, each divisor can give one solution. Since there are 20 divisors, but many will not give solutions in the interval or will have no solution.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m where the solution s from the congruence is in the interval. Since m=240 has many divisors, perhaps this gives enough solutions.\n\nBut I think this is going to take too long. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem: find the least b where there are more than ten b-beautiful numbers. The example given is b=13 has 3. Let me see for b=100:\n\nWait, perhaps trying m= 120 (b=121). Let me see:\n\nm=120. The number of solutions was 8. Not enough.\n\nWait, let me think of the possible s values.\n\nEach solution corresponds to a pair (d, m/d) where d divides m. The number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m where the solution s exists in the interval. Since each such divisor gives a unique solution, the total number is the number of such divisors.\n\nThus, if m has more than 10 divisors, perhaps there are more than 10 solutions. But the number of solutions is not exactly equal to the number of divisors, since some divisors may lead to s outside the interval or no solution.\n\nWait, for m= 240, which has 20 divisors, maybe half of them give solutions within the interval, leading to 10 or more.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider m= 360 (b=361):\n\nDivisors of 360: many, but let me see.\n\nTake d= 2: s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod180.\n\ns=180k+1. 180k+1 \u22610 mod2 \u21d2180k must be odd, which is impossible. No solution.\n\nd=3: s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod120.\n\ns=120k+1. 120k+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d2120k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d20\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d2 no solution.\n\nd=4: s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod90.\n\ns=90k+1. 90k+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d290k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d290\u22612 mod4 \u21d22k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d22k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2 no solution.\n\nd=5: s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod72.\n\ns=72k+1. 72k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d272k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d272\u22612 mod5 \u21d22k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k\u22612 mod5.\n\nThus k=5m+2. s=72*(5m+2)+1=360m+145.\n\nWithin [ceil(sqrt(361))=19, 360], m=0 gives145, m=1 gives505>360. So s=145.\n\nContinuing this way, each valid divisor may contribute one solution. Since m=360 has 24 divisors, perhaps half of them give valid solutions, totaling around 12. That could be over 10.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the minimal b is 361 (m=360).

So for each divisor d of m, there is at most one solution s. So the total number of solutions is the number of such divisors d where s is in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m].\n\nHence, to have more than 10 solutions, m must have over 10 such divisors d where s is in the interval.\n\nThe number of such divisors d is equal to the number of divisors d of m such that the solution s for the congruence s\u22610 mod d and s\u22611 mod (m/d) lies within the interval.\n\nThis count can be approximated by the number of divisors of m, but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121 (m=120).

Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the problem might be expecting an answer where m is a factorial number or highly composite.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the number of solutions increases when m has many divisors.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me start by understanding the problem again. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when you write n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. So that checks out. \n\nAlright, so to approach this problem, I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n satisfy the two conditions, and then find the smallest b where that count exceeds 10. \n\nFirst, let me formalize the conditions mathematically. \n\nIf n is a two-digit number in base b, then it can be expressed as n = a*b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a must be at least 1 (because leading zeros aren't allowed), and both a and c must be between 0 and b-1. However, since a is the first digit, a is from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1. \n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c. \n\nTherefore, substituting n from the first equation into the second condition: sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c. \n\nTo make this easier, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\na*b + c = (a + c)^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\na*b + c = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0.\n\nHmm, that might not be the most straightforward way to handle this. Maybe instead, let's express it as:\n\n(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can rearrange terms to group variables:\n\nLet me see. Let me write the equation again:\n\na*b + c = (a + c)^2.\n\nLet me try to rearrange this equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Maybe express b in terms of a and c?\n\nStarting with:\n\na*b = (a + c)^2 - c\n\nTherefore,\n\nb = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a.\n\nHmm, that could be a way. Since a and c are digits in base b, with a from 1 to b-1 and c from 0 to b-1, perhaps for given a and c, we can compute b and see if it's an integer greater than or equal to the maximum digit plus one?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this as for each base b, determine all possible a and c such that the equation holds, then count the number of such n's (which would be the number of (a,c) pairs). Then, find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the minimal b, perhaps I can find an expression for the number of solutions in terms of b, then find when that number exceeds 10. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since the equation is a*b + c = (a + c)^2, perhaps I can fix a and c and compute b, then ensure that the digits a and c are valid in base b. Since a must be less than b, and c must be less than b. So, for given a and c, b must satisfy b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a, and also b must be greater than a (since a is a digit in base b) and greater than c (since c must also be a digit in base b). Wait, actually, since c can be up to b-1, so as long as c < b, but since b is computed from a and c, we need to have b > max(a, c). Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider variables a and c such that a and c are non-negative integers, with a \u2265 1, c \u2265 0, and b must be an integer such that b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a, and also b must be at least a + 1 (since a must be less than b) and at least c + 1 (since c must be less than b). \n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of thinking in terms of a and c, we can parameterize in terms of s = a + c, since the square root is s. Then, since s = sqrt(n), n must be a perfect square. Also, since n = a*b + c, which is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b (when a=1, c=0) and b\u00b2 - 1 (since the maximum two-digit number is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1). Therefore, n is in [b, b\u00b2 - 1], so sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b\u00b2 -1). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is less than b, so s must be an integer between ceiling(sqrt(b)) and b -1, perhaps?\n\nWait, but s is a + c, where a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, so s is at least 1. But since n is at least b, so sqrt(n) is at least sqrt(b). So s must be an integer greater than or equal to ceil(sqrt(b)). But s must also be such that n = s\u00b2 = a*b + c. Since a and c are digits in base b, with a from 1 to b-1 and c from 0 to b-1, so a*b + c is between b and b\u00b2 -1. So s\u00b2 must be between b and b\u00b2 -1, so s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)) which is b-1. So s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can rephrase the equation as:\n\ns = a + c,\n\nand n = s\u00b2 = a*b + c.\n\nSo substituting c = s - a into the second equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + (s - a)\n\n=> s\u00b2 = a*b + s - a\n\n=> s\u00b2 - s = a*(b -1)\n\nTherefore, a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So a must be an integer, so (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1). Since a must also be between 1 and b-1, so (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) must be an integer in that interval. \n\nAlternatively, rearranged:\n\nb - 1 divides s\u00b2 - s, so (b -1) | s(s -1)\n\nTherefore, for each s, possible b-1 must be a divisor of s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime, so any divisor of s(s-1) must be a product of a divisor of s and a divisor of s-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for given s, the possible values of b-1 are the divisors of s(s-1). Therefore, b can be written as d + 1, where d divides s(s-1). \n\nBut since b has to be greater than or equal to 2, so d must be at least 1, so s(s-1) must be at least 1, which it is for s >=2. \n\nWait, but s is the sum of the two digits, which are a and c, each at least 0. Since a is at least 1, s is at least 1. But s must be at least 2? Because if s is 1, then a + c =1, so either a=1 and c=0, which would give n =1*b +0 = b, but then sqrt(n) would be sqrt(b). So sqrt(b) must equal 1, so b must be 1, but b is at least 2. Therefore, s must be at least 2. \n\nTherefore, s can be from 2 up to b-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible s (starting from 2 upwards), we can find possible b's such that (b-1) divides s(s-1), and then a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1). Then, since a must be between 1 and b-1, the value of a must satisfy 1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo, let's write that inequality:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1.\n\nMultiply all terms by (b -1):\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 - s \u2265 b -1,\n\nand s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nHmm, so maybe for a given s, these inequalities define a range for b?\n\nAlternatively, since b-1 divides s(s-1), let me denote d = b -1, so d divides s(s-1). Then, d must be a positive integer divisor of s(s-1), and b = d +1. \n\nThen, a = s(s -1)/d. Since a must be between 1 and b -1 = d, so 1 \u2264 s(s-1)/d \u2264 d.\n\nTherefore, s(s -1)/d \u2264 d \u21d2 s(s -1) \u2264 d\u00b2.\n\nBut since d divides s(s-1), d\u00b2 \u2265 s(s-1). So, the second inequality is automatically satisfied? Wait, not necessarily. Let me think again.\n\nWait, s(s -1)/d must be \u2264 d \u21d2 s(s -1) \u2264 d\u00b2. But d divides s(s-1), so d is a divisor, so s(s-1) = d * k, where k is an integer. Then, s(s-1) = d*k, so s(s-1)/d = k. Therefore, the inequality s(s -1)/d \u2264 d \u21d2 k \u2264 d. Since k must be an integer, so the maximum possible k is d, but k can be as small as 1. \n\nSo, to have 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d. Since k = s(s-1)/d, and d divides s(s-1), so k is an integer. So, k must be between 1 and d. \n\nTherefore, for each s, the possible d's (which are divisors of s(s-1)) must satisfy that s(s-1)/d is between 1 and d. So, s(s-1)/d \u2264 d \u21d2 s(s-1) \u2264 d\u00b2, and s(s-1)/d \u22651 \u21d2 s(s-1) \u2265 d. \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of s(s-1), the value of d must satisfy sqrt(s(s-1)) \u2265 d \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1))? Wait, that can't be. Wait, actually, the first inequality s(s-1) \u2264 d\u00b2, so d \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1)), and the second inequality s(s-1) \u2265 d. \n\nTherefore, combining both, d must be between sqrt(s(s-1)) and s(s-1). But since d divides s(s-1), the possible d's are divisors of s(s-1) that are between sqrt(s(s-1)) and s(s-1). But since d must divide s(s-1), and be at least sqrt(s(s-1)), so the possible d's are the divisors of s(s-1) that are greater than or equal to sqrt(s(s-1)). \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe let me try an example. Let me pick a specific s and see how this works.\n\nTake the example given in the problem: 81 is 13-eautiful. Here, n =81, which is 63 in base 13. So, a=6, c=3. Then s = a + c =9, so s=9. Then, s squared is 81, which is n. \n\nLet's see how this fits into the equations. \n\nGiven s=9, then s(s-1) =9*8=72. Then d = b-1, so b=13, so d=12. \n\nCheck if 12 divides 72? Yes, 72/12=6. So a=72/12=6, which is correct. \n\nSo that works. \n\nAnother example, let's say s=2. Then s(s-1)=2*1=2. The divisors of 2 are 1,2. \n\nFor d=1: then b=2, and a=2/1=2. But a must be less than b=2, so a must be 1. But 2 is not less than 2, so that's invalid. \n\nFor d=2: then b=3, a=2/2=1. Then a=1 is okay, since a must be less than b=3. Then c = s -a =2 -1=1. So n = a*b +c =1*3 +1=4. Then sqrt(4)=2, which equals s=2. So 4 is 3-eautiful. \n\nSo that works. \n\nSo, in this case, for s=2, the possible d's are 2, leading to b=3. \n\nSo, for each s, the possible divisors d of s(s-1) must be such that when you compute a = s(s-1)/d, then a must be between 1 and d (since b = d+1, so a must be less than d+1, so a <= d). \n\nTherefore, for each s, the number of possible b's would correspond to the number of divisors d of s(s-1) where d is between sqrt(s(s-1)) and s(s-1), but also ensuring that a = s(s-1)/d is an integer between 1 and d. \n\nAlternatively, since d divides s(s-1), and a = s(s-1)/d must be an integer between 1 and d, so d must be at least a, but since a is s(s-1)/d, then s(s-1)/d \u2264 d \u21d2 s(s-1) \u2264 d\u00b2. \n\nWait, this seems to be going in circles. Maybe another approach is better. \n\nPerhaps instead of trying to parameterize in terms of s and d, let's think of for a given base b, how many numbers n are b-eautiful. \n\nGiven that n is a two-digit number in base b, so n = a*b + c, with a from 1 to b-1 and c from 0 to b-1. The sum a + c must equal sqrt(n). So sqrt(n) must be an integer, so n must be a perfect square. Let me denote s = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = s\u00b2 = a*b + c, and a + c = s. \n\nTherefore, substituting c = s - a into the equation for n: \n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + (s - a) \n\n=> s\u00b2 = a*b + s - a \n\n=> s\u00b2 - s = a*(b - 1) \n\nTherefore, a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) \n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, this equation gives a condition on s and b. \n\nTherefore, for each base b, the possible s must be integers such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and the resulting a must be between 1 and b-1. \n\nTherefore, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s for which (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and when you compute a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), then a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1, and then c = s - a must also be between 0 and b -1 (since c is a digit in base b). \n\nSo, to count the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b, we can do the following steps:\n\n1. Find all integers s such that s\u00b2 is a two-digit number in base b. Since n = s\u00b2 must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and b\u00b2 -1 (the largest two-digit number, which is (b-1)b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1). Therefore, s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is slightly less than b, so s can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1. \n\n2. For each s in that range, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). \n\n3. If it is, compute a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). \n\n4. Check if a is between 1 and b -1, and then check that c = s - a is between 0 and b -1. \n\nBut actually, since c = s - a, and a must be at least 1, so c can be as low as s - (b -1). Wait, but since a must be at least 1, then c = s - a \u2264 s -1. Since s can be up to b -1, so c can be up to (b -1) -1 = b -2, which is okay because c must be less than b. Similarly, c must be non-negative, so s - a \u2265 0 \u21d2 a \u2264 s. \n\nTherefore, as long as a is between 1 and s, then c will be between 0 and s -1. But also, since a must be \u2264 b -1 (since it's a digit), but since s can be up to b -1, then if a is up to s, but s is up to b -1, so a is up to b -1. So the main constraints are:\n\n- 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1\n\n- 0 \u2264 c = s - a \u2264 b -1\n\nTherefore, the second condition gives:\n\ns - a \u2265 0 \u21d2 a \u2264 s,\n\nand\n\ns - a \u2264 b -1 \u21d2 a \u2265 s - (b -1).\n\nBut since a must also be at least 1, the lower bound on a is max(1, s - (b -1)). \n\nHowever, since a must be an integer, these constraints might automatically be satisfied given the previous conditions. \n\nBut perhaps this is overcomplicating. Let me think again. Since we already have a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Let's see:\n\nGiven that a must be between 1 and b -1, so:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo, multiplying through by (b -1):\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nTherefore, for a given b, s must satisfy:\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 b -1,\n\nand also,\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps for a given b, we can compute the possible s values by iterating s from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b-1 and check whether (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and then check if a is within the required bounds. \n\nAlternatively, since s must be such that (b -1) divides (s\u00b2 - s), so (s\u00b2 - s) mod (b -1) = 0. \n\nAlternatively, s(s -1) \u2261 0 mod (b -1). \n\nTherefore, for each b, we can look for integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that s(s -1) \u2261 0 mod (b -1). \n\nAlternatively, note that s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, since their product is divisible by (b -1), and since they are coprime, one of them must be divisible by a factor of (b -1), but not necessarily the entire (b -1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in that interval where s \u22610 or 1 mod d, where d is a divisor? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed numerically. Since the problem asks for the minimal b where there are more than 10 b-eautiful numbers, perhaps we can look for b starting from 2 upwards and compute the count until we find one with count >10. \n\nBut doing this manually might be tedious, but perhaps we can find a pattern or formula. \n\nAlternatively, let's try to find the number of solutions for a given b. \n\nThe key equation is s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nSo, for each s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], check if (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nAlternatively, for a given b, the number of s such that s(s-1) mod (b-1) =0. \n\nAlternatively, note that s and s-1 are coprime, so the factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of (b -1), we can find s such that s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod d. But since we need s(s-1) divisible by (b-1), which is the product of its prime factors. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that either:\n\n- s \u22610 mod (b-1), or \n\n- s \u22611 mod (b-1),\n\nBut that might not be accurate, since the factors could be distributed between s and s-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in that interval such that s \u22610 mod k or s \u22611 mod m, where k and m are divisors of (b-1). Hmm, this might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each divisor d of (b-1), we can find solutions s where s \u22610 mod d and s-1 \u22610 mod ( (b-1)/d ), but this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of trying to count analytically, I can look for a pattern by computing the counts for various b. \n\nLet me start with small b and see how the counts go. \n\nStart with b=2:\n\nThen, two-digit numbers in base 2 are from 2 (10_2) to 3 (11_2). \n\nSo n must be 2 or 3. \n\nsqrt(n) must be integer. So sqrt(2) is irrational, sqrt(3) is irrational. So no solutions. Therefore count=0.\n\nb=3:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base 3: from 3 (10_3) to 8 (22_3). \n\nPossible n must be perfect squares between 3 and 8. The squares here are 4 (2\u00b2) and 9 (3\u00b2) but 9 is 100_3 which is three digits. So only 4. \n\nCheck if 4 is 3-eautiful. 4 in base 3 is 11 (since 1*3 +1=4). The digits sum to 1+1=2, which is sqrt(4)=2. So yes, 4 is 3-eautiful. \n\nThus count=1.\n\nb=4:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base4: 4 (10_4) to 15 (33_4). \n\nPerfect squares in this range: 4 (2\u00b2), 9 (3\u00b2), 16 (4\u00b2) but 16 is 100_4. So 4,9.\n\nCheck 4: in base4, 10 (1 and 0). Sum is 1+0=1, but sqrt(4)=2. Not equal. \n\nWait, so 4 is 10_4, digits 1 and 0, sum is 1, which is not 2. So not beautiful. \n\nNext, 9: 21_4 (2*4 +1=9). Sum is 2+1=3, which is sqrt(9)=3. So yes. \n\nThus count=1 (only 9).\n\nWait, but maybe another number?\n\nWait, 16 is excluded because it's three digits, so only 4 and 9. So only 9 counts. So total count 1.\n\nHmm.\n\nb=5:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base5: 5 to 24.\n\nPerfect squares here: 9 (3\u00b2), 16 (4\u00b2), 25 (5\u00b2) which is three digits. So 9,16.\n\nCheck 9: 14_5 (1*5 +4=9). Sum is 1+4=5 \u22603. Not good.\n\nWait sqrt(9)=3. So sum needs to be 3. \n\nWait, 9 in base5 is 14? Wait 1*5 +4=9, yes, so digits 1 and 4. Their sum is 5, not 3. So no. \n\nWait, then how about 16? 16 in base5 is 31 (3*5 +1=16). Sum is 3+1=4, which is sqrt(16)=4. So yes, that's good. \n\nThus count=1 (only 16).\n\nWait, any others?\n\nWhat about 4? 4 is 04_5, but leading zeros not allowed. So only 16. \n\nHmm. \n\nb=6:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from 6 to 35. \n\nSquares: 9,16,25,36 (too big). \n\nCheck each:\n\n9: 13_6 (1*6 +3=9). Sum is 4 vs sqrt(9)=3. Not equal.\n\n16: 24_6 (2*6+4=16). Sum is 6 vs sqrt(16)=4. Not equal.\n\n25:41_6 (4*6 +1=25). Sum is 5 vs sqrt(25)=5. 5=5. So yes.\n\nThus count=1 (25).\n\nHmm. \n\nContinuing to b=7:\n\nTwo-digit numbers 7 to 48.\n\nSquares: 9,16,25,36,49 (too big).\n\nCheck 9: 12_7 (1+2=3, sqrt(9)=3. So digits 1 and 2. Sum is 3. So yes, 9 is 7-eautiful? Wait 1*7 +2=9. Sum 1+2=3 which is sqrt(9). So yes, that works. \n\nWait, so that's an additional one. \n\n16: 22_7 (2+2=4. sqrt(16)=4. So yes. 22_7 is 2*7+2=16. Sum is 4. So that works. \n\n25: 34_7 (3+4=7 vs sqrt(25)=5. Not equal. \n\n36: 51_7 (5+1=6 vs sqrt(36)=6. So yes. \n\nTherefore, in base7, the numbers 9,16,36 are beautiful. \n\nSo count=3. \n\nWait, so that's a jump. Let me verify:\n\nFor 9: 12_7. 1+2=3, sqrt(9)=3. Correct.\n\n16: 22_7. 2+2=4, sqrt(16)=4. Correct.\n\n36: 5*7 +1 =36, digits 5 and1, sum 6. sqrt(36)=6. Correct. \n\nSo three numbers. \n\nSo b=7 has count 3.\n\nContinuing. \n\nb=8:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from 8 to 63.\n\nSquares up to 63: 9,16,25,36,49,64 (too big).\n\nCheck each:\n\n9: 11_8 (1+1=2 vs 3). No.\n\nWait 9 in base8 is 11? 1*8 +1=9. Sum 2\u22603. Not good.\n\nWait, need to check other representations. Wait, maybe another way?\n\nWait, 9 in base8 is 11, but sum is 2. Not equal. \n\n16: 20_8 (2+0=2 vs 4). No. \n\nAlternatively, 20_8 is 16. 2+0=2\u22604. \n\nWait 16 is 20_8, which sum is 2. Not equal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 16 is written as 2*8 +0, so no. \n\nWait, next square:25. 25 in base8 is 31 (3*8 +1=25). Sum 4 vs sqrt(25)=5. Not equal. \n\n36:44_8 (4+4=8 vs 6). No. \n\nWait 44_8 is 36? 4*8 +4=36. Sum is 8 vs 6. Not equal. \n\n49:61_8 (6+1=7 vs7. sqrt(49)=7. So 6+1=7. That works. \n\nThus 49 is 61_8, so yes. \n\nSo that's one. \n\nWait, 36: maybe another representation?\n\nWait 36 in base8 is 44. So that's 4+4=8. Not 6. \n\nWait, 25 in base8 is 31. 3+1=4 vs 5. No.\n\nWait 16: perhaps another way? No. \n\nWait 9: 11_8. \n\nWait, so only 49 qualifies? \n\nWait, let me check 49: yes, 61_8. \n\nWhat about 64 is too big. \n\nWait, maybe 16 is not, but 25 also no, 36 no. \n\nWait, is there another?\n\nWait, let's check 64 is excluded. \n\nWait, 16: maybe another base 8 representation? No. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed another square?\n\nWait, 49 is the only one. Wait, but let's see s= sqrt(n). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps s must be between ceil(sqrt(8))=3 and 7 (since b-1=7). \n\nSo s from 3 to7. \n\nSo s=3,4,5,6,7.\n\nLet me check for each s:\n\nFor s=3: n=9. \n\nEquation: a*b +c =9, with a +c=3. \n\nSo a +c=3. \n\nExpressed as a*8 +c =9. Since a must be at least1. Let me see:\n\nPossible a from1 to 2 (since a <= b-1=7, but since a +c=3, a can be 1 or 2.\n\nIf a=1: c=2. Then 1*8 +2=10\u22609. Not good.\n\na=2: c=1. 2*8 +1=17\u22609. Not good.\n\nThus s=3 has no solution. \n\nWait, but earlier thought that 9 could be 11_8 gives sum 2\u22603. So that's why no solution here. \n\nWait, s=4: n=16. \n\nEquation: a*8 +c=16, a +c=4. \n\nSo, a +c=4, so c=4 -a. \n\nThus, substituting into first equation: a*8 + (4 -a)=16 \u21d2 7a +4=16 \u21d27a=12 \u21d2a=12/7\u22481.714. Not integer. \n\nThus no solution for s=4. \n\ns=5: n=25. \n\nEquation: a*8 +c=25, a +c=5. \n\nThus c=5 -a. Substitute:\n\n8a +5 -a =25 \u21d27a =20 \u21d2a\u22482.857. Not integer. \n\ns=6: n=36. \n\na +c=6, so c=6 -a. \n\nEquation:8a + (6 -a)=36 \u21d27a +6=36 \u21d27a=30 \u21d2a\u22484.285. Not integer. \n\ns=7: n=49. \n\na +c=7, so c=7 -a. \n\nEquation:8a +7 -a=49 \u21d27a=42 \u21d2a=6. \n\nThus, a=6, c=1. 6*8 +1=49. So that works. \n\nThus, only s=7 gives a solution. So count=1 for b=8? Wait but earlier thought 49 is valid. So count=1? But in my previous thought I thought there was only one. \n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought maybe 49 was the only one. \n\nWait, so total count for b=8 is 1. Hmm, so my initial thought was wrong. \n\nHmm, so maybe my first approach was wrong. \n\nWait, so I need to be careful here. \n\nSo in base8, only 49 is beautiful. \n\nMoving on to b=9:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from9 to80.\n\nSquares up to 80: 9,16,25,36,49,64,81 (too big).\n\nCheck each:\n\ns=3 (n=9):\n\na*9 +c=9, a +c=3. \n\na from1 to2 (since a +c=3, a can be 1 or 2). \n\na=1: c=2. 1*9 +2=11\u22609. \n\na=2: c=1. 2*9 +1=19\u22609. No solution.\n\ns=4 (16):\n\na +c=4. \n\nEquation:9a +c=16 \u21d29a + (4 -a)=16 \u21d28a +4=16 \u21d28a=12 \u21d2a=1.5.

Not integer.\n\ns=8 (64):\n\na +c=8 \u21d2c=8 -a.\n\nEquation:9a +8 -a=64 \u21d28a=56 \u21d2a=7. \n\nThus, a=7, c=1. 7*9 +1=64. \n\nCheck digits: 7 and1. Sum is8. sqrt(64)=8. So yes. \n\nThus, 64 is valid. \n\nThus, only one solution for b=9. \n\nHmm. \n\nb=10:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from10 to99.\n\nSquares up to 99: 16,25,36,49,64,81.\n\nCheck each:\n\ns=4 (16):\n\na*10 +c=16, a +c=4. \n\nThus, c=4 -a. \n\nSo 10a + (4 -a)=16 \u21d29a=12 \u21d2a=12/9=4/3. Not integer.\n\ns=5 (25):\n\na +c=5 \u21d2c=5 -a.\n\n10a +5 -a =25 \u21d29a=20 \u21d2a\u22482.22. No.\n\ns=6 (36):\n\nc=6 -a.\n\n10a +6 -a=36 \u21d29a=30 \u21d2a\u22483.333. No.\n\ns=7 (49):\n\nc=7 -a.\n\n10a +7 -a=49 \u21d29a=42 \u21d2a\u22484.666. No.\n\ns=8 (64):\n\nc=8 -a.\n\n10a +8 -a=64 \u21d29a=56 \u21d2a\u22486.222. No.\n\ns=9 (81):\n\nc=9 -a.\n\n10a +9 -a=81 \u21d29a=72 \u21d2a=8.\n\nThus, a=8, c=1. 8*10 +1=81. Sum 9. sqrt(81)=9. Correct. \n\nThus, only 81 is valid. So count=1. \n\nWait, but the problem statement says 81 is 13-eautiful, but in base10, it's also a two-digit number (81 is two digits in base10), so why isn't it considered 10-eautiful? Wait, because in base10, 81 is written as 8 and 1, which sum to 9, which is sqrt(81). Wait, but in base10, 81 is two digits, so it should be 10-eautiful. Wait, why did I not count it here?\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait for b=10, s=9 (since sqrt(81)=9). \n\nThen, a +c=9, and n=81= a*10 +c. \n\nSo substituting c=9 -a:\n\n10a + (9 -a)=81 \u21d29a +9 =81 \u21d29a=72 \u21d2a=8. \n\nThus, a=8, c=1. \n\nWhich is exactly 81 in base10. So digits 8 and 1. Sum is 9. So yes, it is 10-eautiful. \n\nWait, so why did I think count was 1? Because 81 is valid. So why earlier steps?\n\nWait, let me check the previous steps again. \n\nWait when I considered s=9, I should have counted that. \n\nWait in my earlier step-by-step for b=10, I considered s=9:\n\ns=9 (81):\n\na +c=9, so c=9 -a.\n\nEquation:10a + (9 -a)=81 \u21d29a +9=81 \u21d29a=72 \u21d2a=8. \n\nThus, that's valid, so yes, 81 is valid. \n\nAdditionally, are there any others? \n\nWait let me check s= sqrt(25)=5:\n\nWait 25 is 25 in base10. Which is two digits: 2 and5. Sum is7\u22605. So no. \n\nWait 36 is 3 and6. Sum 9\u22606. \n\n49 is 4 and9. Sum 13\u22607. \n\n64 is 6 and4. Sum 10\u22608. \n\nThus, only 81. So count is1. Wait, but 81 is valid, so count is1? \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, they said 81 is 13-eautiful, but in base10 it's also 10-eautiful. So why is the count only 1? \n\nWait, perhaps I missed another number? Let me check s= sqrt(16)=4. \n\nWait 16 in base10 is 1 and6. Sum 7\u22604. \n\ns= sqrt(25)=5, which gives sum 7\u22605. \n\ns= sqrt(36)=6. 36 in base10 is 3 and6, sum 9\u22606. \n\ns= sqrt(49)=7. 4 and9, sum 13\u22607. \n\ns= sqrt(64)=8. 6 and4, sum10\u22608. \n\ns= sqrt(81)=9, which works. \n\ns= sqrt(100)=10, but 100 is three digits in base10. \n\nThus, only 81 is valid, so count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nContinuing to b=11:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from11 to 120 (since 11\u00b2-1=120). \n\nSquares up to 120: 16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121 (too big).\n\nCheck each s from ceil(sqrt(11))=4 to 10 (b-1=10).\n\ns=4 (16):\n\na*11 +c=16, a +c=4. \n\nc=4 -a. \n\nEquation:11a +4 -a =16 \u21d210a=12 \u21d2a=1.2. Not integer.\n\ns=5 (25):\n\nc=5 -a.\n\n11a +5 -a=25 \u21d210a=20 \u21d2a=2. \n\nThus, a=2, c=3. \n\nCheck: 2*11 +3=25. Sum 2+3=5=sqrt(25). So yes. \n\nThus, 25 is valid. \n\ns=6 (36):\n\nc=6 -a.\n\n11a +6 -a=36 \u21d210a=30 \u21d2a=3. \n\nThus, a=3, c=3. \n\nCheck: 3*11 +3=36. Sum 6. sqrt(36)=6. Yes. \n\ns=7 (49):\n\nc=7 -a.\n\n11a +7 -a=49 \u21d210a=42 \u21d2a=4.2. Not integer.\n\ns=8 (64):\n\nc=8 -a.\n\n11a +8 -a=64 \u21d210a=56 \u21d2a=5.6.

Correct. \n\nThus, for s=5,6,10, so three solutions: 25, 36, 100. \n\nWait, so count is 3? \n\nWait, let me verify each:\n\nFor s=5: 25 is 23_11? Wait no: 2*11 +3=25. Yes. \n\ns=6: 3*11 +3=36. \n\ns=10: 9*11 +1=100. \n\nThus, three numbers. \n\nTherefore, count=3 for b=11.\n\nContinuing to b=12:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from12 to 143.\n\nSquares up to 143: 16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144 (too big).\n\nSo s ranges from 4 to 11 (since b-1=11).\n\nCheck each s:\n\ns=4 (16):\n\na*12 +c=16, a +c=4.\n\nc=4 -a. \n\nEquation:12a +4 -a=16 \u21d211a=12 \u21d2a=12/11\u22481.09.

No.\n\ns=11 (121):\n\nc=11 -a.\n\n12a +11 -a=121 \u21d211a=110 \u21d2a=10. \n\nThus, a=10, c=1. \n\nCheck:10*12 +1=121. Sum 10+1=11=sqrt(121)=11. Correct. \n\nThus, only s=11 gives a solution. \n\nWait, but let me check s= sqrt(25)=5:\n\nWait, 25 in base12 is 21 (2*12 +1=25). Sum is 3\u22605. \n\nWait, but according to the equations above, s=5 didn't yield a solution. \n\nWait, but 25 in base12 is 21, so sum is 2+1=3\u22605. So no. \n\nSimilarly for 36 in base12 is 3*12 +0=36? No, 3*12=36, so it's 30_12, digits 3 and0. Sum 3\u22606. \n\nWait, 36 in base12 would be 30, but 3+0=3\u22606. \n\nWait, so perhaps only 121 is valid. \n\nWait, so count=1 for b=12?\n\nWait, but let me check s=10:\n\nWait, s=10: n=100. \n\na=8.18, which is not integer. \n\nThus only 121 is valid. \n\nHmm. \n\nContinuing to b=13:\n\nThe example given is 81 is 13-eautiful. Let's see.\n\nTwo-digit numbers up to 13\u00b2 -1=168.\n\nSquares up to 168: 16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144,169 (too big).\n\nThus s from 4 to12.\n\nCheck each s:\n\ns=4 (16):\n\na*13 +c=16, a +c=4.\n\nc=4 -a.\n\n13a +4 -a =16 \u21d212a =12 \u21d2a=1. \n\nThus, a=1, c=3. \n\nCheck:1*13 +3=16.

Correct. \n\nThus, s=4,9,12 give valid numbers. \n\nSo 16,81,144.

Maybe I need a better approach. \n\nLooking for when the count exceeds 10, so need to find a base where there are more than ten such numbers. \n\nLet me see if I can find a formula for the number of solutions for a given b.\n\nRecall that the equation is s(s-1) divisible by (b-1), and a = s(s-1)/(b-1) must be between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, given that a and c are digits in base b, so c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1. \n\nBut since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, and a is between 1 and b-1, then c = s - a will be between (s - (b-1)) and (s -1). \n\nBut since s is at most b-1, s - (b-1) can be negative. So need to ensure that s - a \u22650 \u21d2 a \u2264 s. \n\nSo, given a = s(s-1)/(b-1), the conditions are:\n\n1. 1 \u2264 s(s-1)/(b-1) \u2264 b-1,\n\n2. s - [s(s-1)/(b-1)] \u22650 \u21d2 s \u2265 s(s-1)/(b-1),\n\nand \n\n3. s - [s(s-1)/(b-1)] \u2264 b-1 \u21d2 s - s(s-1)/(b-1) \u2264 b-1.\n\nThe first condition is already covered by the first inequality. \n\nAlternatively, the key is to find s such that (b-1) divides s(s-1), and a = s(s-1)/(b-1) must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 s (since c = s - a must be non-negative) and also a must be \u2264 b-1. \n\nSo for each b, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where s(s-1) divisible by (b-1) and s(s-1)/(b-1) is an integer between 1 and s. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, the number of divisors of s(s-1) that equal (b-1). But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, notice that for a given b, the equation a = s(s-1)/(b-1) must be integer, so s(s-1) must be divisible by (b-1). \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s(s-1) mod (b-1) =0. \n\nSo maybe the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in that interval where s \u22610 or 1 mod d, where d divides (b-1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, then (b-1) must divide s or s-1, but not necessarily entirely. \n\nWait, since s and s-1 are coprime, then any common divisor of s and s-1 must be 1. Therefore, the factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. \n\nTherefore, for (b-1) to divide s(s-1), it must be that all prime factors of (b-1) are present in either s or s-1. \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of (b-1), we can have s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod ( (b-1)/d ). \n\nBut this is getting into more number theory than I can handle quickly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). Let me denote k = b-1. Then, the equation is s(s-1) divisible by k. \n\nWe need to find the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod k. \n\nWait, since b =k+1, so sqrt(b) is sqrt(k+1). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider for each k =b-1, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod k. \n\nPerhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in that interval where s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod d for some divisor d of k? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in that interval such that s \u22610 mod (k) or s \u22611 mod (k), but that's too restrictive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps when k is small, the number of solutions is small, but as k increases, the number of solutions may increase. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps when k is a prime number, the only solutions are s=0 mod k (but s can't be 0) or s=1 mod k. But since s is between sqrt(k+1) and k, s=1 mod k would only be s=1, which is too small. So only s \u22610 mod k would be s=k, but s must be at most k, so s=k. Then s(k)=k*(k-1). So s(s-1)=k(k-1). Which is divisible by k, yes. So for prime k, only s=k gives a solution. \n\nThus, when b-1 is prime, the count is 1 (only s=b-1). \n\nBut when k is composite, there are more divisors, so more possible s. \n\nTherefore, to get more solutions, k should have many factors, so b-1 should be composite with many factors. \n\nThus, perhaps the minimal b would be when b-1 is a highly composite number. \n\nThe first few highly composite numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, etc. \n\nThus, trying b-1=12 (so b=13) gives count=3 (as before). \n\nb-1=24 (b=25) might give more. \n\nAlternatively, trying b=25, but that might take time. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b=16. Wait already did b=16, count=3. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b=12, count=1. \n\nWait, perhaps b=24? Let me try b=12:\n\nWait already did b=12, count=1. \n\nWait, perhaps b=24:\n\nb=24, so k=23 (prime). So count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait b=12 is 11, which is prime. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b=21 (k=20). \n\nLet me try b=21. \n\nb=21:\n\nk=20. \n\nWe need to find s in [ceil(sqrt(21)),20] which is [5,20]. \n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by 20. \n\n20 factors: 2^2*5. \n\nThus, s(s-1) must be divisible by 4 and 5. \n\nSince s and s-1 are coprime, so one must be divisible by 4, and one must be divisible by 5. \n\nEither:\n\nCase1: s divisible by 4 and s-1 divisible by 5. \n\nOr \n\nCase2: s divisible by5 and s-1 divisible by4. \n\nAdditionally, since they are consecutive, the divisibility can be checked. \n\nLet me look for s in 5-20 where either:\n\nCase1: s \u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod5. \n\nOr \n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod4. \n\nSolve these congruences. \n\nCase1:\n\nFind s \u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod5. \n\nLet s=4a. Then 4a \u22611 mod5 \u21d24a \u22611 mod5 \u21d2a\u22614^{-1}*1 mod5. Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 inverse of 4 mod5 is4. Thus a\u22614 mod5. \n\nThus, a=5b +4. So s=4*(5b+4)=20b +16. \n\nWithin 5 to20:\n\nPossible b=0: s=16. \n\nb=1: s=36 which exceeds 20. \n\nThus only s=16. \n\nCase2:\n\ns\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod4. \n\nLet s=5a. Then 5a\u22611 mod4 \u21d25a \u22611 mod4 \u21d2a\u22611 mod4 (since 5\u22611 mod4). \n\nThus a=4b +1. \n\nThus s=5*(4b+1)=20b +5. \n\nWithin 5-20:\n\nb=0: s=5. \n\nb=1: s=25 which exceeds. \n\nThus s=5. \n\nAdditionally, check s=5 and s=16. \n\nAlso, maybe other solutions where s divisible by 20? \n\ns=20: 20 divides 20, so s=20. \n\nCheck s=20:\n\ns(s-1)=20*19 divisible by 20? Yes. \n\nThus, s=20 is also a solution. \n\nThus, total s values:5,16,20. \n\nCheck each:\n\nFor s=5:\n\na= s(s-1)/k =5*4/20=1. \n\nThus a=1, c=5-1=4. \n\nCheck:1*21 +4=25. sqrt(25)=5. Correct. \n\ns=16:\n\na=16*15/20=240/20=12. \n\nThus a=12, c=16-12=4. \n\nCheck:12*21 +4=252 +4=256. sqrt(256)=16. Correct. \n\ns=20:\n\na=20*19/20=19. \n\nThus a=19, c=20 -19=1. \n\nCheck:19*21 +1=399 +1=400. sqrt(400)=20. Correct. \n\nThus, three solutions. \n\nAdditionally, check if there are other solutions where s(s-1) divisible by 20 but not covered by cases above. \n\nFor example, s divisible by 5 and s-1 divisible by 4. \n\nWait, s=5: yes. \n\ns=16: divisible by4 and s-1=15 divisible by5. \n\ns=20: divisible by5, s-1=19 which isn't divisible by4, but s divisible by20, so overall divisible by20. \n\nThus total count=3. \n\nHmm, still low. \n\nTrying b=25 (k=24). \n\nb=25:\n\nk=24. \n\nWe need s in [5,24]. \n\ns(s-1) divisible by24. \n\n24=2^3*3. \n\nThus, s(s-1) must be divisible by 8 and 3. \n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even, so divisible by 2, but need divisibility by8 and 3. \n\nSo either:\n\nCase1: s divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by3, or \n\ns divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by8. \n\nOr other combinations where factors are spread between s and s-1. \n\nAlternatively, since they are coprime, the factors must be in one or the other. \n\nTo get divisibility by8 and3:\n\nEither:\n\n- s divisible by8 and s divisible by3 (so divisible by24) or s divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by3,\n\n- or s divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by8,\n\n- or s-1 divisible by both8 and3 (so s divisible by1 mod24). \n\nWait this is getting complex. \n\nAlternatively, the number of s in [5,24] such that s(s-1) divisible by24. \n\nPossible s where s or s-1 divisible by 8, and s or s-1 divisible by3. \n\nLet me list all s from5 to24 and check:\n\nCheck divisibility by24:\n\ns=5:5*4=20 \u2192 no.\n\n6:6*5=30 \u2192 30 divisible by6 but not 24.\n\n7:7*6=42 \u2192 divisible by6, not24.\n\n8:8*7=56 \u2192 divisible by8, but 56 mod3=2 \u2192 no.\n\n9:9*8=72 \u2192 divisible by8? 72/8=9. Yes. 72 divisible by24? 72/24=3. Yes. \n\nThus s=9 is okay. \n\n10:10*9=90 \u2192 divisible by 2*3*3*5 \u2192 24 not a factor. \n\n11:11*10=110 \u2192 no.\n\n12:12*11=132 \u2192132/24=5.5 \u2192 no.\n\n13:13*12=156 \u2192156/24=6.5 \u2192 no.\n\n14:14*13=182 \u2192 no.\n\n15:15*14=210 \u2192210/24=8.75 \u2192 no.\n\n16:16*15=240 \u2192240/24=10 \u2192 yes. \n\n17:17*16=272 \u2192272/24\u224811.33 \u2192 no.\n\n18:18*17=306 \u2192306/24=12.75 \u2192 no.\n\n19:19*18=342 \u2192 no.\n\n20:20*19=380 \u2192 no.\n\n21:21*20=420 \u2192420/24=17.5 \u2192 no.\n\n22:22*21=462 \u2192462/24=19.25 \u2192 no.\n\n23:23*22=506 \u2192 no.\n\n24:24*23=552 \u2192552/24=23 \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, s=9,16,24. \n\nCheck each:\n\nFor s=9:\n\na= s(s-1)/k=9*8/24=3. \n\nThus a=3, c=6. \n\nCheck:3*25 +6=75 +6=81. sqrt(81)=9. Correct. \n\ns=16:\n\na=16*15/24=10. \n\nThus a=10, c=6. \n\nWait c=16-10=6. \n\nCheck:10*25 +6=250 +6=256. sqrt(256)=16. Correct. \n\ns=24:\n\na=24*23/24=23. \n\nThus a=23, c=1. \n\nCheck:23*25 +1=575 +1=576. sqrt(576)=24. Correct. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nTrying b=24 (k=23, prime). \n\nWait b=24:\n\nk=23 (prime). So s must be divisible by23, so s=23. \n\nThus:\n\na=23*22/23=22. \n\nCheck:22*24 +1=528 +1=529. sqrt(529)=23. Correct. \n\nThus count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nTrying b=18 (k=17, prime). \n\nAlready did that, count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nTrying b=20 (k=19, prime). \n\nThus count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nMaybe b=28 (k=27). \n\nk=27=3^3. \n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by27. \n\nThus, since s and s-1 coprime, one must be divisible by27. \n\nThus s=27 or s-1=27. \n\nBut s \u226427 (since b=28, s up to27). \n\nThus s=27 or s=28? Wait s<=27. \n\nThus s=27 or s=28? Wait no. \n\nWait s must be in [5,27]. \n\nThus s=27 gives s-1=26. \n\nThus s=27: s divisible by27? 27 divides27, so yes. \n\nThus s=27: \n\na=27*26/27=26. \n\nCheck:26*28 +1=728 +1=729. sqrt(729)=27. Correct. \n\nAlso, s=28 is beyond the max s=27. \n\nAdditionally, s-1 divisible by27: s=28, which is too big. \n\nThus, only s=27. \n\nCount=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nTrying b=21 (k=20). \n\nEarlier found count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nMaybe try b=24 (k=23). \n\nAlready did that. \n\nHmm, this trial and error might not be effective. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation a = s(s-1)/(b-1). \n\nSince a must be \u2264s, then s(s-1)/(b-1) \u2264s \u21d2 (s-1)/(b-1) \u22641 \u21d2 s-1 \u2264b-1 \u21d2s \u2264b. Which holds since s is up to b-1. \n\nThus, the key condition is that s(s-1) must be divisible by (b-1). \n\nThus for each b, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). \n\nTo maximize this count, (b-1) should have many divisors so that s(s-1) can be divisible by it in multiple ways. \n\nThus, b-1 should be a number with many factors. \n\nThe number of solutions is equal to the number of s in the interval where s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod d for each divisor d of (b-1). \n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s such that (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nThe number of such s in [1, b-1] is equal to the number of solutions to s(s-1)\u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive, the solutions are s \u22610 or1 mod d for each divisor d of (b-1). \n\nBut this might be complex. \n\nAlternatively, note that the number of solutions s in [1,b-1] is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1), but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the equation s(s-1) \u22610 mod k (where k =b-1) has solutions s\u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod (k/d) for each divisor d of k. \n\nThus, the total number of solutions is the sum over divisors d of k of \u03c6(d), but not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions modulo k is equal to the number of solutions to s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod e where d and e are divisors such that d*e divides k? \n\nThis is getting too abstract. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of solutions occurs when k is a factorial or highly composite. \n\nLet me try b=25 (k=24). \n\nEarlier count=3. \n\nTrying b=36 (k=35). \n\nk=35=5*7. \n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by35. \n\nThus, s divisible by5 and s-1 divisible by7, or s divisible by7 and s-1 divisible by5. \n\nAlso, s divisible by35. \n\nLet me find s in [6,35]:\n\nCase1: s divisible by5, s-1 divisible by7. \n\ns=5a. \n\n5a -1 divisible by7 \u21d25a \u22611 mod7 \u21d2a\u22613 mod7 (since 5*3=15\u22611 mod7). \n\nThus a=7b +3. \n\nThus s=5*(7b +3)=35b +15. \n\nWithin 6-35:\n\nb=0: s=15. \n\nb=1: s=50>35. \n\nThus s=15. \n\nCase2: s divisible by7, s-1 divisible by5. \n\ns=7a. \n\n7a -1 divisible by5 \u21d27a\u22611 mod5 \u21d22a\u22611 mod5 \u21d2a\u22613 mod5 (2*3=6\u22611 mod5). \n\nThus a=5b+3. \n\nThus s=7*(5b+3)=35b+21. \n\nWithin 6-35:\n\nb=0: s=21. \n\nb=1: s=56>35. \n\nThus s=21. \n\nCase3: s divisible by35. \n\ns=35. \n\ns=35: s(s-1)=35*34 divisible by35. \n\nThus s=35. \n\nThus total solutions s=15,21,35. \n\nCheck each:\n\ns=15:\n\na=15*14/35=6. \n\nThus a=6, c=9. \n\nCheck:6*36 +9=216 +9=225. sqrt(225)=15.

Not integer. Wait no, 30*29=870. 870/60=14.5. Not integer. \n\nHmm, so not valid. \n\nWait, but s(s-1)=30*29=870. 870 divisible by60? 60*14=840, 60*14.5=870. So yes divisible by60, but 14.5 is not integer. \n\nWait, but a must be integer. \n\nWait the equation requires that (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nYes, but a must be integer. \n\nWait, but in this case, a= s(s-1)/(b-1)=870/60=14.5. Not integer. \n\nThus, s=30 is not a solution. \n\nHmm, so even though divisible by60, a is not integer. \n\nThus my mistake earlier. \n\nThus need s(s-1) divisible by60 and s(s-1)/60 must be integer. \n\nThus s=30 gives a=14.5, which is not integer. So not valid. \n\nThus, s=40 gives a=26. \n\nSimilarly, s=45:\n\n45*44=1980 mod60=0. \n\nThus s=45:\n\na=45*44/60= (45/60)*44= (3/4)*44=33. \n\nThus a=33, c=12. \n\nCheck:33*61 +12=2013+12=2025. sqrt(2025)=45.

Correct. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is frustrating. \n\nWait maybe b= 60 (k=59). \n\nk=59 is prime. \n\nThus s=59. \n\nThus count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait perhaps b= 121 (k=120). \n\nEarlier count was6. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait let me try b= 25 (k=24). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait maybe I need to try b= 100 (k=99). \n\nWait tried that, count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait perhaps I need to consider when k is a multiple of many small numbers. \n\nWait, let me try b= 25 (k=24). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait maybe b= 21 (k=20). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I need to try b= 36 (k=35). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a different approach. \n\nRecall the equation:\n\ns(s-1) = (b-1)*a \n\nSince a must be between1 and s (since c = s -a \u22650), \n\nthen:\n\ns(s-1)/(b-1) = a \u2264s \u21d2 s-1 \u2264b-1 \u21d2b\u2265 s. \n\nBut since b > s (since s \u2264b-1), so equality when s=b-1. \n\nThus, the maximum possible s is b-1. \n\nThe equation is s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). \n\nLet me set s =b-1. \n\nThen, s(s-1)= (b-1)(b-2). \n\nThus, (b-1)(b-2) divisible by (b-1) \u21d2 yes, so s=b-1 is always a solution. \n\nThus, for any b\u22652, s=b-1 is a solution. \n\nThus, there is at least one solution for any b. \n\nAdditionally, other solutions may exist. \n\nThus, the total number of solutions is at least1. \n\nTo have more than10 solutions, need many s in the interval [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] that satisfy the divisibility. \n\nPerhaps when b-1 is a factorial number. \n\nLet me try b= 120 (k=119). \n\nBut that had count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me try b= 25 (k=24). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to try b= 100 (k=99). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait perhaps b= 105 (k=104). \n\nk=104=8*13. \n\nThus s(s-1) divisible by104. \n\nThus divisible by8 and13. \n\nSince s and s-1 coprime, so one divisible by8 and the other divisible by13, or one divisible by104. \n\nCase1: s divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by13. \n\ns=8a. \n\n8a-1 \u22610 mod13 \u21d28a\u22611 mod13 \u21d2a\u22615 mod13 (8*5=40\u22611 mod13). \n\nThus a=13b+5 \u21d2 s=8*(13b+5)=104b +40. \n\nWithin s in [11,104]: \n\nb=0: s=40. \n\nb=1: s=144>104. \n\nThus s=40. \n\nCase2: s divisible by13 and s-1 divisible by8. \n\ns=13a. \n\n13a -1 \u22610 mod8 \u21d213a\u22611 mod8 \u21d25a\u22611 mod8 \u21d2a\u22615 mod8 (5*5=25\u22611 mod8). \n\nThus a=8b+5 \u21d2 s=13*(8b+5)=104b+65. \n\nWithin s in [11,104]: \n\nb=0: s=65. \n\nb=1: s=169>104. \n\nThus s=65. \n\nCase3: s divisible by104. \n\ns=104. \n\nThus s=104. \n\nThus solutions s=40,65,104. \n\nCheck:\n\ns=40:\n\na=40*39/104= (40/104)*39= (10/26)*39= (5/13)*39=15. \n\nThus a=15, c=25. \n\nCheck:15*105 +25=1575+25=1600. sqrt(1600)=40. Correct. \n\ns=65:\n\na=65*64/104= (65/104)*64= (5/8)*64=40. \n\nThus a=40, c=25. \n\nCheck:40*105 +25=4200+25=4225. sqrt(4225)=65. Correct. \n\ns=104:\n\na=104*103/104=103. \n\nCheck:103*105 +1=10815+1=10816. sqrt(10816)=104. Correct. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps b= 120 (k=119). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe b= 2520 (k=2519). \n\nBut that's too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm missing something in the equations. \n\nLet me revisit the equation: \n\na = s(s-1)/(b-1). \n\nThus, for a to be an integer between1 and s, we have:\n\n1 \u2264 s(s-1)/(b-1) \u2264 s. \n\nThe first inequality gives:\n\ns(s-1)/(b-1) \u22651 \u21d2 s(s-1) \u2265 b-1. \n\nThe second inequality gives:\n\ns(s-1)/(b-1) \u2264 s \u21d2 s-1 \u2264 b-1 \u21d2 s \u2264 b. \n\nWhich holds since s \u2264b-1. \n\nThus, the key is that s(s-1) \u2265 b-1 and divisible by (b-1). \n\nThus, s(s-1) must be a multiple of (b-1) and at least (b-1). \n\nThus, the minimal multiple is (b-1) itself. \n\nThus, when s(s-1) = (b-1)*k, where k is integer between1 and s. \n\nThus, the number of solutions is the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nTo maximize the number of solutions, (b-1) should have many divisors, so that s(s-1) can be multiples of (b-1) for many s. \n\nThus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in the interval where s \u22610 or1 mod d for each divisor d of (b-1). \n\nBut this is still vague. \n\nAlternatively, note that for each divisor d of (b-1), there can be solutions where s \u22610 mod d and s-1 \u22610 mod ( (b-1)/d ). \n\nThus, the number of solutions is the number of divisors d of (b-1) such that there exists s in the interval satisfying those congruences. \n\nThe number of such solutions would be the number of divisors d of (b-1), which for highly composite (b-1) can be large. \n\nThus, perhaps the minimal b where (b-1) has more than 10 divisors would give the required count. \n\nThe number of divisors function \u03c4(k) for a number k. \n\nWe need \u03c4(k) >10. \n\nThe smallest k with \u03c4(k) >10 is 60 (\u03c4(60)=12). \n\nThus if we take b-1=60, so b=61. \n\nEarlier tried b=61 and found count=6. \n\nHmm, but \u03c4(60)=12, but the count was6. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait \u03c4(k) is the number of divisors, but the number of solutions s would be less because each divisor pair may give one solution. \n\nThus, perhaps we need \u03c4(k) to be even higher. \n\nNext highly composite number after60 is 120 (\u03c4(120)=16). \n\nThus b=121 (k=120). \n\nEarlier tried b=121, count=6. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to try b= 2520 (k=2519). \n\nBut that's too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait let's try b= 24 (k=23). \n\nCount=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires a different approach. \n\nLet me think of s and a. \n\nFrom the equation a = s(s-1)/(b-1), \n\nthen b-1 = s(s-1)/a. \n\nSince b must be an integer greater than s (since s \u2264b-1), \n\nthen b = s(s-1)/a +1. \n\nThus, for each pair (a,s) with 1\u2264a \u2264s and s \u2265ceil(sqrt(b)), \n\nthen b must be equal to s(s-1)/a +1. \n\nThus, for each a and s with 1\u2264a \u2264s, \n\nb = s(s-1)/a +1. \n\nThus, to find all b-eautiful numbers, we can iterate over possible a and s, compute b, and collect all n =s\u00b2 for each b. \n\nThus, to find the minimal b where there are more than10 such numbers, we can look for b that can be expressed as (s(s-1)/a)+1 for many pairs (a,s). \n\nThus, to maximize the count, we need b to be expressible as s(s-1)/a +1 in many ways. \n\nThus, the number of representations of b-1 as s(s-1)/a for integers a,s with 1\u2264a \u2264s and s(s-1)/a integer. \n\nThus, the number of factor pairs (a, s(s-1)/a) of (b-1). \n\nWait, since b-1 = s(s-1)/a \u21d2 a must be a divisor of s(s-1). \n\nThus, for each divisor a of s(s-1), with 1\u2264a \u2264s, then b= s(s-1)/a +1. \n\nThus, the number of solutions for a given b is equal to the number of pairs (s,a) where a divides s(s-1), a \u2264s, and b= s(s-1)/a +1. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors a of s(s-1) such that a \u2264s and s(s-1)/a =b-1. \n\nThus, for each divisor a of (b-1), we can set s(s-1) = a*(b-1). \n\nThus, solving s^2 -s - a*(b-1)=0. \n\nThe solutions are s=(1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +4a(b-1)))/2. \n\nThus, for s to be integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square: 1 +4a(b-1)=k\u00b2. \n\nThis approach might be too involved. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for b where b-1 has many factor pairs (a, d) such that a*d = s(s-1) for some s. \n\nThus, the number of such s is the number of ways to write s(s-1) as a product of two factors a and d with a \u2264s and d =b-1. \n\nThus, for each b, the count is the number of s where s(s-1) can be divided into a and d with a \u2264s and d =b-1. \n\nThus, the number of s where b-1 divides s(s-1), which is what I was doing before. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that my trials up to b=121 only give counts up to6, perhaps I need to consider higher bases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in my approach. \n\nWait, in the example given, b=13 has 81 as a solution, but there are other solutions as well. \n\nWait let me recheck b=13:\n\nFor b=13, k=12. \n\ns(s-1) divisible by12. \n\nPossible s from4 to12. \n\ns=4:4*3=12 divisible by12 \u21d2 yes. \n\nThus s=4: \n\na=4*3/12=1. \n\nThus a=1, c=3. \n\nCheck:1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4. Correct. \n\ns=9: \n\n9*8=72 divisible by12 \u21d2 yes. \n\nThus s=9: a=72/12=6. \n\nCheck:6*13+3=81. Correct. \n\ns=12: \n\n12*11=132 divisible by12 \u21d2 yes. \n\nThus s=12: a=132/12=11. \n\nCheck:11*13 +1=143+1=144. sqrt(144)=12. Correct. \n\nThus total solutions s=4,9,12. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nWait, so three solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the minimal b is 121, with count=6. \n\nWait but the problem says \"more than ten\", so need count>10. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of b where b-1 is a factorial. \n\nLet me try b= 721 (k=720). \n\nk=720=2^4*3^2*5. \n\nThus, the number of divisors is (4+1)(2+1)(1+1)=5*3*2=30. \n\nThus, there are30 divisors. \n\nThus, potentially, there could be many solutions. \n\nBut this is getting too big. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but I need to find when count exceeds10. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in my approach and I need to consider that when s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1), but a can be any divisor, not necessarily the one from the equation. \n\nWait, but the equation requires a = s(s-1)/(b-1). \n\nThus, for each s in the interval, if (b-1) divides s(s-1), then it's a solution. \n\nThus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the smallest b where this count exceeds10. \n\nTo find this, perhaps I can write a program, but since I'm doing this manually, let me try b= 240 (k=239). \n\nk=239 is prime. Thus count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nb= 252 (k=251). \n\nPrime. Count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nb= 240 (k=239). \n\nHmm. \n\nWait let's try b= 100 (k=99). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps b= 60 (k=59). \n\nPrime. Count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but even then count=6. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in my previous trials. \n\nWait let me try b= 25 (k=24). \n\nCount=3. \n\nWait maybe b= 105 (k=104). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait let me think of when s(s-1) can be divisible by (b-1) for many s. \n\nSuppose (b-1) is 24 (b=25). \n\nThen, s(s-1) divisible by24. \n\nPossible s from5 to24. \n\ns=8: divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by3 (7 divisible by3? No). \n\nWait 8*7=56 not divisible by24. \n\nWait earlier for b=25, s=9,16,24. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait maybe b= 12 (k=11). \n\nCount=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, this is perplexing. Maybe the problem requires a different insight. \n\nWait, let me think of the equation again:\n\nThe two-digit number in base b is n = a*b +c, with a from1 tob-1 and c from0 tob-1. \n\nThe sum a +c = sqrt(n). \n\nThus, n must be a perfect square, so let n = s\u00b2. \n\nThus, s\u00b2 = a*b +c, with a +c = s. \n\nThus, substituting c = s -a into the first equation gives:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + (s -a) \u21d2 s\u00b2 -s = a*(b -1). \n\nThus, for each s, a must be (s\u00b2 -s)/(b -1). \n\nThus, for a to be an integer between1 and b-1, \n\n(b-1) must divide s(s-1), and \n\n1 \u2264 (s(s-1))/(b-1) \u2264 b-1. \n\nThe second inequality implies s(s-1) \u2264 (b-1)^2. \n\nThus, s must be \u2264b-1 (since s(s-1) \u2264 (b-1)^2 \u21d2 s \u2264b). \n\nThus, the possible s are from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1. \n\nThe number of solutions is the number of s in this interval where (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nTo have more than10 solutions, we need many s in this interval divisible by (b-1) or adjacent to a multiple. \n\nPerhaps when (b-1) is a perfect square. \n\nWait, let me try b= 25 (k=24). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, when (b-1) is a multiple of many small numbers. \n\nLet me try b= 36 (k=35). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when (b-1) is a multiple of 6, there are more solutions. \n\nWait, but I tried b=6 (k=5). \n\nCount=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 100. \n\nWait let me try b= 120 (k=119). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that when (b-1) is a factorial. \n\nFor example, b= 721 (k=720). \n\nBut this is too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121. \n\nWait, but I need to find the minimal b where count exceeds10. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me try b= 121 (k=120). \n\nEarlier count=6. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 2521 (k=2520). \n\nBut this is too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that for each s from1 to b-1, there is a solution. \n\nWait, but s must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)). \n\nThus, the number of solutions is roughly b - ceil(sqrt(b)). \n\nThus, to have more than10 solutions, need b - sqrt(b) >10. \n\nSolving b - sqrt(b) >10. \n\nLet me set x= sqrt(b). \n\nThus, x\u00b2 -x >10 \u21d2x\u00b2 -x -10>0. \n\nSolutions x> (1 +sqrt(41))/2 \u2248 (1+6.4)/2\u22483.7. \n\nThus, when x>3.7, so b>13.69. \n\nThus for b>14, this inequality holds. \n\nBut this is just the number of possible s, but not the actual count of solutions. \n\nThus, the actual count is the number of s in that interval where (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nThus, to have count>10, need at least11 s's in the interval where (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nThus, the minimal b where this occurs would be when (b-1) has many factors so that many s's satisfy the divisibility. \n\nThe minimal such b would be when (b-1) is a number with many divisors. \n\nThe first number with more than10 divisors is 60 (\u03c4(60)=12). \n\nThus, b=61. \n\nEarlier for b=61, count=6. \n\nHmm, but \u03c4(60)=12, but count=6. \n\nPerhaps I need a number with \u03c4(k)=24, like 360. \n\n\u03c4(360)=24. \n\nThus b=361 (k=360). \n\nThus, trying b=361 (k=360). \n\nk=360=2^3*3^2*5. \n\nThus, the number of divisors is (3+1)(2+1)(1+1)=4*3*2=24. \n\nThus, potentially many solutions. \n\nLet me see how many s satisfy s(s-1) divisible by360. \n\ns in [19,360]. \n\nThis would take time, but let's try a few. \n\ns=20:\n\n20*19=380 mod360=20.

Not integer. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, s must be sqrt(n). \n\nWait n= s\u00b2. \n\nThus, if s=180, then n=180\u00b2=32400. \n\nThus, a*b +c =32400. \n\nWith a=32400/360=90. \n\nThus a=90, c=180 -90=90. \n\nCheck:90*361 +90=90*(361+1)=90*362=32580. \n\nBut 180\u00b2=32400\u226032580. \n\nThus, this is incorrect. \n\nWait, what's wrong here. \n\nWait, the equation is s\u00b2 =a*b +c. \n\nWith b=361, a=90, c=90. \n\nThus 90*361 +90= 90*(361+1)=90*362=32580. \n\nBut s= sqrt(32580) \u2248180.5, not integer. \n\nThus, my mistake: s must be integer. \n\nThus s=180 gives n=32400. \n\nThus, a*b +c=32400. \n\nThus, a= (s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1)= (180\u00b2 -180)/360= (32400-180)/360=32220/360=90. \n\nThus, a=90, c= s -a=180-90=90. \n\nThus, the number is a*b +c=90*361 +90=32580, which is not s\u00b2=32400. \n\nThus, this is a contradiction. \n\nWait, so my mistake is that s must satisfy s\u00b2= a*b +c. \n\nThus, in this case, the equation s\u00b2 = a*b +c must hold. \n\nThus, s=180 gives a=90, c=90. \n\nThus, n=90*361 +90=90*(361+1)=90*362=32580. \n\nBut s=180, so s\u00b2=32400\u226032580. \n\nThus, this is invalid. \n\nThus, my earlier assumption that s(s-1) divisible by k implies the solution is incorrect. \n\nWait, what's wrong here? \n\nAh, the equation is s\u00b2 = a*b +c. \n\nWith a= s(s-1)/(b-1), and c= s -a. \n\nThus, substituting: \n\ns\u00b2 = [s(s-1)/(b-1)]*b + (s - [s(s-1)/(b-1)]) \n\nLet me check this: \n\nLeft side: s\u00b2 \n\nRight side: [s(s-1)b/(b-1)] + s - [s(s-1)/(b-1)] \n\n= [s(s-1)b/(b-1) - s(s-1)/(b-1)] + s \n\n= [s(s-1)(b -1)/(b-1)] + s \n\n= s(s-1) + s \n\n= s\u00b2 -s +s \n\n= s\u00b2. \n\nThus, the equation holds. \n\nThus, the solution is valid. \n\nThus, in the case above, s=180, b=361, gives n= s\u00b2=32400. \n\nBut the actual value computed is 32580. \n\nWait, discrepancy. \n\nWait, let me recompute: \n\na = s(s-1)/(b-1) =180*179/360= (180/360)*179=0.5*179=89.5 \n\nAh! Here's the mistake! \n\nWait, s(s-1) =180*179=32220. \n\nDivided by b-1=360 gives 32220/360=89.5, which is not integer. \n\nThus, s=180 does not satisfy the divisibility condition. \n\nThus my earlier mistake was in thinking s=180 would work",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the least integer b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. Let me start by understanding the problem again. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when you write n in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of those two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nThe example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is the square root of 81. So that checks out. \n\nAlright, so to approach this problem, I need to figure out for each base b, how many numbers n satisfy the two conditions, and then find the smallest b where that count exceeds 10. \n\nFirst, let me formalize the conditions mathematically. \n\nIf n is a two-digit number in base b, then it can be expressed as n = a*b + c, where a and c are the digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, the first digit a must be at least 1 (because leading zeros aren't allowed), and both a and c must be between 0 and b-1. However, since a is the first digit, a is from 1 to b-1, and c is from 0 to b-1. \n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits a + c equals the square root of n. So, sqrt(n) = a + c. \n\nTherefore, substituting n from the first equation into the second condition: sqrt(a*b + c) = a + c. \n\nTo make this easier, let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:\n\na*b + c = (a + c)^2.\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\na*b + c = a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2.\n\nLet me rearrange this equation to bring all terms to one side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0.\n\nHmm, that might not be the most straightforward way to handle this. Maybe instead, let's express it as:\n\n(a + c)^2 - a*b - c = 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can rearrange terms to group variables:\n\nLet me see. Let me write the equation again:\n\na*b + c = (a + c)^2.\n\nLet me try to rearrange this equation to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Maybe express b in terms of a and c?\n\nStarting with:\n\na*b = (a + c)^2 - c\n\nTherefore,\n\nb = [ (a + c)^2 - c ] / a.\n\nHmm, that could be a way. Since a and c are digits in base b, with a from 1 to b-1 and c from 0 to b-1, perhaps for given a and c, we can compute b and see if it's an integer greater than or equal to the maximum digit plus one?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach this as for each base b, determine all possible a and c such that the equation holds, then count the number of such n's (which would be the number of (a,c) pairs). Then, find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the minimal b, perhaps I can find an expression for the number of solutions in terms of b, then find when that number exceeds 10. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since the equation is a*b + c = (a + c)^2, perhaps I can fix a and c and compute b, then ensure that the digits a and c are valid in base b. Since a must be less than b, and c must be less than b. So, for given a and c, b must satisfy b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a, and also b must be greater than a (since a is a digit in base b) and greater than c (since c must also be a digit in base b). Wait, actually, since c can be up to b-1, so as long as c < b, but since b is computed from a and c, we need to have b > max(a, c). Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider variables a and c such that a and c are non-negative integers, with a \u2265 1, c \u2265 0, and b must be an integer such that b = [(a + c)^2 - c]/a, and also b must be at least a + 1 (since a must be less than b) and at least c + 1 (since c must be less than b). \n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of thinking in terms of a and c, we can parameterize in terms of s = a + c, since the square root is s. Then, since s = sqrt(n), n must be a perfect square. Also, since n = a*b + c, which is a two-digit number in base b, so n is between b (when a=1, c=0) and b\u00b2 - 1 (since the maximum two-digit number is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1). Therefore, n is in [b, b\u00b2 - 1], so sqrt(n) is between sqrt(b) and sqrt(b\u00b2 -1). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is less than b, so s must be an integer between ceiling(sqrt(b)) and b -1, perhaps?\n\nWait, but s is a + c, where a is at least 1 and c is at least 0, so s is at least 1. But since n is at least b, so sqrt(n) is at least sqrt(b). So s must be an integer greater than or equal to ceil(sqrt(b)). But s must also be such that n = s\u00b2 = a*b + c. Since a and c are digits in base b, with a from 1 to b-1 and c from 0 to b-1, so a*b + c is between b and b\u00b2 -1. So s\u00b2 must be between b and b\u00b2 -1, so s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)) which is b-1. So s can be from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can rephrase the equation as:\n\ns = a + c,\n\nand n = s\u00b2 = a*b + c.\n\nSo substituting c = s - a into the second equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + (s - a)\n\n=> s\u00b2 = a*b + s - a\n\n=> s\u00b2 - s = a*(b -1)\n\nTherefore, a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nHmm, that's interesting. So a must be an integer, so (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1). Since a must also be between 1 and b-1, so (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) must be an integer in that interval. \n\nAlternatively, rearranged:\n\nb - 1 divides s\u00b2 - s, so (b -1) | s(s -1)\n\nTherefore, for each s, possible b-1 must be a divisor of s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime, so any divisor of s(s-1) must be a product of a divisor of s and a divisor of s-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for given s, the possible values of b-1 are the divisors of s(s-1). Therefore, b can be written as d + 1, where d divides s(s-1). \n\nBut since b has to be greater than or equal to 2, so d must be at least 1, so s(s-1) must be at least 1, which it is for s >=2. \n\nWait, but s is the sum of the two digits, which are a and c, each at least 0. Since a is at least 1, s is at least 1. But s must be at least 2? Because if s is 1, then a + c =1, so either a=1 and c=0, which would give n =1*b +0 = b, but then sqrt(n) would be sqrt(b). So sqrt(b) must equal 1, so b must be 1, but b is at least 2. Therefore, s must be at least 2. \n\nTherefore, s can be from 2 up to b-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each possible s (starting from 2 upwards), we can find possible b's such that (b-1) divides s(s-1), and then a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b-1). Then, since a must be between 1 and b-1, the value of a must satisfy 1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo, let's write that inequality:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1.\n\nMultiply all terms by (b -1):\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nSo, s\u00b2 - s \u2265 b -1,\n\nand s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nHmm, so maybe for a given s, these inequalities define a range for b?\n\nAlternatively, since b-1 divides s(s-1), let me denote d = b -1, so d divides s(s-1). Then, d must be a positive integer divisor of s(s-1), and b = d +1. \n\nThen, a = s(s -1)/d. Since a must be between 1 and b -1 = d, so 1 \u2264 s(s-1)/d \u2264 d.\n\nTherefore, s(s -1)/d \u2264 d \u21d2 s(s -1) \u2264 d\u00b2.\n\nBut since d divides s(s-1), d\u00b2 \u2265 s(s-1). So, the second inequality is automatically satisfied? Wait, not necessarily. Let me think again.\n\nWait, s(s -1)/d must be \u2264 d \u21d2 s(s -1) \u2264 d\u00b2. But d divides s(s-1), so d is a divisor, so s(s-1) = d * k, where k is an integer. Then, s(s-1) = d*k, so s(s-1)/d = k. Therefore, the inequality s(s -1)/d \u2264 d \u21d2 k \u2264 d. Since k must be an integer, so the maximum possible k is d, but k can be as small as 1. \n\nSo, to have 1 \u2264 k \u2264 d. Since k = s(s-1)/d, and d divides s(s-1), so k is an integer. So, k must be between 1 and d. \n\nTherefore, for each s, the possible d's (which are divisors of s(s-1)) must satisfy that s(s-1)/d is between 1 and d. So, s(s-1)/d \u2264 d \u21d2 s(s-1) \u2264 d\u00b2, and s(s-1)/d \u22651 \u21d2 s(s-1) \u2265 d. \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of s(s-1), the value of d must satisfy sqrt(s(s-1)) \u2265 d \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1))? Wait, that can't be. Wait, actually, the first inequality s(s-1) \u2264 d\u00b2, so d \u2265 sqrt(s(s-1)), and the second inequality s(s-1) \u2265 d. \n\nTherefore, combining both, d must be between sqrt(s(s-1)) and s(s-1). But since d divides s(s-1), the possible d's are divisors of s(s-1) that are between sqrt(s(s-1)) and s(s-1). But since d must divide s(s-1), and be at least sqrt(s(s-1)), so the possible d's are the divisors of s(s-1) that are greater than or equal to sqrt(s(s-1)). \n\nHmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe let me try an example. Let me pick a specific s and see how this works.\n\nTake the example given in the problem: 81 is 13-eautiful. Here, n =81, which is 63 in base 13. So, a=6, c=3. Then s = a + c =9, so s=9. Then, s squared is 81, which is n. \n\nLet's see how this fits into the equations. \n\nGiven s=9, then s(s-1) =9*8=72. Then d = b-1, so b=13, so d=12. \n\nCheck if 12 divides 72? Yes, 72/12=6. So a=72/12=6, which is correct. \n\nSo that works. \n\nAnother example, let's say s=2. Then s(s-1)=2*1=2. The divisors of 2 are 1,2. \n\nFor d=1: then b=2, and a=2/1=2. But a must be less than b=2, so a must be 1. But 2 is not less than 2, so that's invalid. \n\nFor d=2: then b=3, a=2/2=1. Then a=1 is okay, since a must be less than b=3. Then c = s -a =2 -1=1. So n = a*b +c =1*3 +1=4. Then sqrt(4)=2, which equals s=2. So 4 is 3-eautiful. \n\nSo that works. \n\nSo, in this case, for s=2, the possible d's are 2, leading to b=3. \n\nSo, for each s, the possible divisors d of s(s-1) must be such that when you compute a = s(s-1)/d, then a must be between 1 and d (since b = d+1, so a must be less than d+1, so a <= d). \n\nTherefore, for each s, the number of possible b's would correspond to the number of divisors d of s(s-1) where d is between sqrt(s(s-1)) and s(s-1), but also ensuring that a = s(s-1)/d is an integer between 1 and d. \n\nAlternatively, since d divides s(s-1), and a = s(s-1)/d must be an integer between 1 and d, so d must be at least a, but since a is s(s-1)/d, then s(s-1)/d \u2264 d \u21d2 s(s-1) \u2264 d\u00b2. \n\nWait, this seems to be going in circles. Maybe another approach is better. \n\nPerhaps instead of trying to parameterize in terms of s and d, let's think of for a given base b, how many numbers n are b-eautiful. \n\nGiven that n is a two-digit number in base b, so n = a*b + c, with a from 1 to b-1 and c from 0 to b-1. The sum a + c must equal sqrt(n). So sqrt(n) must be an integer, so n must be a perfect square. Let me denote s = sqrt(n). Therefore, n = s\u00b2 = a*b + c, and a + c = s. \n\nTherefore, substituting c = s - a into the equation for n: \n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + (s - a) \n\n=> s\u00b2 = a*b + s - a \n\n=> s\u00b2 - s = a*(b - 1) \n\nTherefore, a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b - 1) \n\nSince a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, this equation gives a condition on s and b. \n\nTherefore, for each base b, the possible s must be integers such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b - 1), and the resulting a must be between 1 and b-1. \n\nTherefore, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s for which (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and when you compute a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), then a must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1, and then c = s - a must also be between 0 and b -1 (since c is a digit in base b). \n\nSo, to count the number of b-eautiful numbers for a given b, we can do the following steps:\n\n1. Find all integers s such that s\u00b2 is a two-digit number in base b. Since n = s\u00b2 must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b, which is 10_b = b) and b\u00b2 -1 (the largest two-digit number, which is (b-1)b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1). Therefore, s must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 sqrt(b\u00b2 -1). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is slightly less than b, so s can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b - 1. \n\n2. For each s in that range, check if (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1). \n\n3. If it is, compute a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). \n\n4. Check if a is between 1 and b -1, and then check that c = s - a is between 0 and b -1. \n\nBut actually, since c = s - a, and a must be at least 1, so c can be as low as s - (b -1). Wait, but since a must be at least 1, then c = s - a \u2264 s -1. Since s can be up to b -1, so c can be up to (b -1) -1 = b -2, which is okay because c must be less than b. Similarly, c must be non-negative, so s - a \u2265 0 \u21d2 a \u2264 s. \n\nTherefore, as long as a is between 1 and s, then c will be between 0 and s -1. But also, since a must be \u2264 b -1 (since it's a digit), but since s can be up to b -1, then if a is up to s, but s is up to b -1, so a is up to b -1. So the main constraints are:\n\n- 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b -1\n\n- 0 \u2264 c = s - a \u2264 b -1\n\nTherefore, the second condition gives:\n\ns - a \u2265 0 \u21d2 a \u2264 s,\n\nand\n\ns - a \u2264 b -1 \u21d2 a \u2265 s - (b -1).\n\nBut since a must also be at least 1, the lower bound on a is max(1, s - (b -1)). \n\nHowever, since a must be an integer, these constraints might automatically be satisfied given the previous conditions. \n\nBut perhaps this is overcomplicating. Let me think again. Since we already have a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Let's see:\n\nGiven that a must be between 1 and b -1, so:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo, multiplying through by (b -1):\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nTherefore, for a given b, s must satisfy:\n\nsqrt(b) \u2264 s \u2264 b -1,\n\nand also,\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nHmm, perhaps for a given b, we can compute the possible s values by iterating s from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b-1 and check whether (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b -1), and then check if a is within the required bounds. \n\nAlternatively, since s must be such that (b -1) divides (s\u00b2 - s), so (s\u00b2 - s) mod (b -1) = 0. \n\nAlternatively, s(s -1) \u2261 0 mod (b -1). \n\nTherefore, for each b, we can look for integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1] such that s(s -1) \u2261 0 mod (b -1). \n\nAlternatively, note that s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, since their product is divisible by (b -1), and since they are coprime, one of them must be divisible by a factor of (b -1), but not necessarily the entire (b -1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each b, the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in that interval where s \u22610 or 1 mod d, where d is a divisor? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to proceed numerically. Since the problem asks for the minimal b where there are more than 10 b-eautiful numbers, perhaps we can look for b starting from 2 upwards and compute the count until we find one with count >10. \n\nBut doing this manually might be tedious, but perhaps we can find a pattern or formula. \n\nAlternatively, let's try to find the number of solutions for a given b. \n\nThe key equation is s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nSo, for each s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b -1], check if (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nAlternatively, for a given b, the number of s such that s(s-1) mod (b-1) =0. \n\nAlternatively, note that s and s-1 are coprime, so the factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of (b -1), we can find s such that s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod d. But since we need s(s-1) divisible by (b-1), which is the product of its prime factors. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that either:\n\n- s \u22610 mod (b-1), or \n\n- s \u22611 mod (b-1),\n\nBut that might not be accurate, since the factors could be distributed between s and s-1. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in that interval such that s \u22610 mod k or s \u22611 mod m, where k and m are divisors of (b-1). Hmm, this might not be straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each divisor d of (b-1), we can find solutions s where s \u22610 mod d and s-1 \u22610 mod ( (b-1)/d ), but this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of trying to count analytically, I can look for a pattern by computing the counts for various b. \n\nLet me start with small b and see how the counts go. \n\nStart with b=2:\n\nThen, two-digit numbers in base 2 are from 2 (10_2) to 3 (11_2). \n\nSo n must be 2 or 3. \n\nsqrt(n) must be integer. So sqrt(2) is irrational, sqrt(3) is irrational. So no solutions. Therefore count=0.\n\nb=3:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base 3: from 3 (10_3) to 8 (22_3). \n\nPossible n must be perfect squares between 3 and 8. The squares here are 4 (2\u00b2) and 9 (3\u00b2) but 9 is 100_3 which is three digits. So only 4. \n\nCheck if 4 is 3-eautiful. 4 in base 3 is 11 (since 1*3 +1=4). The digits sum to 1+1=2, which is sqrt(4)=2. So yes, 4 is 3-eautiful. \n\nThus count=1.\n\nb=4:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base4: 4 (10_4) to 15 (33_4). \n\nPerfect squares in this range: 4 (2\u00b2), 9 (3\u00b2), 16 (4\u00b2) but 16 is 100_4. So 4,9.\n\nCheck 4: in base4, 10 (1 and 0). Sum is 1+0=1, but sqrt(4)=2. Not equal. \n\nWait, so 4 is 10_4, digits 1 and 0, sum is 1, which is not 2. So not beautiful. \n\nNext, 9: 21_4 (2*4 +1=9). Sum is 2+1=3, which is sqrt(9)=3. So yes. \n\nThus count=1 (only 9).\n\nWait, but maybe another number?\n\nWait, 16 is excluded because it's three digits, so only 4 and 9. So only 9 counts. So total count 1.\n\nHmm.\n\nb=5:\n\nTwo-digit numbers in base5: 5 to 24.\n\nPerfect squares here: 9 (3\u00b2), 16 (4\u00b2), 25 (5\u00b2) which is three digits. So 9,16.\n\nCheck 9: 14_5 (1*5 +4=9). Sum is 1+4=5 \u22603. Not good.\n\nWait sqrt(9)=3. So sum needs to be 3. \n\nWait, 9 in base5 is 14? Wait 1*5 +4=9, yes, so digits 1 and 4. Their sum is 5, not 3. So no. \n\nWait, then how about 16? 16 in base5 is 31 (3*5 +1=16). Sum is 3+1=4, which is sqrt(16)=4. So yes, that's good. \n\nThus count=1 (only 16).\n\nWait, any others?\n\nWhat about 4? 4 is 04_5, but leading zeros not allowed. So only 16. \n\nHmm. \n\nb=6:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from 6 to 35. \n\nSquares: 9,16,25,36 (too big). \n\nCheck each:\n\n9: 13_6 (1*6 +3=9). Sum is 4 vs sqrt(9)=3. Not equal.\n\n16: 24_6 (2*6+4=16). Sum is 6 vs sqrt(16)=4. Not equal.\n\n25:41_6 (4*6 +1=25). Sum is 5 vs sqrt(25)=5. 5=5. So yes.\n\nThus count=1 (25).\n\nHmm. \n\nContinuing to b=7:\n\nTwo-digit numbers 7 to 48.\n\nSquares: 9,16,25,36,49 (too big).\n\nCheck 9: 12_7 (1+2=3, sqrt(9)=3. So digits 1 and 2. Sum is 3. So yes, 9 is 7-eautiful? Wait 1*7 +2=9. Sum 1+2=3 which is sqrt(9). So yes, that works. \n\nWait, so that's an additional one. \n\n16: 22_7 (2+2=4. sqrt(16)=4. So yes. 22_7 is 2*7+2=16. Sum is 4. So that works. \n\n25: 34_7 (3+4=7 vs sqrt(25)=5. Not equal. \n\n36: 51_7 (5+1=6 vs sqrt(36)=6. So yes. \n\nTherefore, in base7, the numbers 9,16,36 are beautiful. \n\nSo count=3. \n\nWait, so that's a jump. Let me verify:\n\nFor 9: 12_7. 1+2=3, sqrt(9)=3. Correct.\n\n16: 22_7. 2+2=4, sqrt(16)=4. Correct.\n\n36: 5*7 +1 =36, digits 5 and1, sum 6. sqrt(36)=6. Correct. \n\nSo three numbers. \n\nSo b=7 has count 3.\n\nContinuing. \n\nb=8:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from 8 to 63.\n\nSquares up to 63: 9,16,25,36,49,64 (too big).\n\nCheck each:\n\n9: 11_8 (1+1=2 vs 3). No.\n\nWait 9 in base8 is 11? 1*8 +1=9. Sum 2\u22603. Not good.\n\nWait, need to check other representations. Wait, maybe another way?\n\nWait, 9 in base8 is 11, but sum is 2. Not equal. \n\n16: 20_8 (2+0=2 vs 4). No. \n\nAlternatively, 20_8 is 16. 2+0=2\u22604. \n\nWait 16 is 20_8, which sum is 2. Not equal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe 16 is written as 2*8 +0, so no. \n\nWait, next square:25. 25 in base8 is 31 (3*8 +1=25). Sum 4 vs sqrt(25)=5. Not equal. \n\n36:44_8 (4+4=8 vs 6). No. \n\nWait 44_8 is 36? 4*8 +4=36. Sum is 8 vs 6. Not equal. \n\n49:61_8 (6+1=7 vs7. sqrt(49)=7. So 6+1=7. That works. \n\nThus 49 is 61_8, so yes. \n\nSo that's one. \n\nWait, 36: maybe another representation?\n\nWait 36 in base8 is 44. So that's 4+4=8. Not 6. \n\nWait, 25 in base8 is 31. 3+1=4 vs 5. No.\n\nWait 16: perhaps another way? No. \n\nWait 9: 11_8. \n\nWait, so only 49 qualifies? \n\nWait, let me check 49: yes, 61_8. \n\nWhat about 64 is too big. \n\nWait, maybe 16 is not, but 25 also no, 36 no. \n\nWait, is there another?\n\nWait, let's check 64 is excluded. \n\nWait, 16: maybe another base 8 representation? No. \n\nWait, perhaps I missed another square?\n\nWait, 49 is the only one. Wait, but let's see s= sqrt(n). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps s must be between ceil(sqrt(8))=3 and 7 (since b-1=7). \n\nSo s from 3 to7. \n\nSo s=3,4,5,6,7.\n\nLet me check for each s:\n\nFor s=3: n=9. \n\nEquation: a*b +c =9, with a +c=3. \n\nSo a +c=3. \n\nExpressed as a*8 +c =9. Since a must be at least1. Let me see:\n\nPossible a from1 to 2 (since a <= b-1=7, but since a +c=3, a can be 1 or 2.\n\nIf a=1: c=2. Then 1*8 +2=10\u22609. Not good.\n\na=2: c=1. 2*8 +1=17\u22609. Not good.\n\nThus s=3 has no solution. \n\nWait, but earlier thought that 9 could be 11_8 gives sum 2\u22603. So that's why no solution here. \n\nWait, s=4: n=16. \n\nEquation: a*8 +c=16, a +c=4. \n\nSo, a +c=4, so c=4 -a. \n\nThus, substituting into first equation: a*8 + (4 -a)=16 \u21d2 7a +4=16 \u21d27a=12 \u21d2a=12/7\u22481.714. Not integer. \n\nThus no solution for s=4. \n\ns=5: n=25. \n\nEquation: a*8 +c=25, a +c=5. \n\nThus c=5 -a. Substitute:\n\n8a +5 -a =25 \u21d27a =20 \u21d2a\u22482.857. Not integer. \n\ns=6: n=36. \n\na +c=6, so c=6 -a. \n\nEquation:8a + (6 -a)=36 \u21d27a +6=36 \u21d27a=30 \u21d2a\u22484.285. Not integer. \n\ns=7: n=49. \n\na +c=7, so c=7 -a. \n\nEquation:8a +7 -a=49 \u21d27a=42 \u21d2a=6. \n\nThus, a=6, c=1. 6*8 +1=49. So that works. \n\nThus, only s=7 gives a solution. So count=1 for b=8? Wait but earlier thought 49 is valid. So count=1? But in my previous thought I thought there was only one. \n\nWait, but in my first approach, I thought maybe 49 was the only one. \n\nWait, so total count for b=8 is 1. Hmm, so my initial thought was wrong. \n\nHmm, so maybe my first approach was wrong. \n\nWait, so I need to be careful here. \n\nSo in base8, only 49 is beautiful. \n\nMoving on to b=9:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from9 to80.\n\nSquares up to 80: 9,16,25,36,49,64,81 (too big).\n\nCheck each:\n\ns=3 (n=9):\n\na*9 +c=9, a +c=3. \n\na from1 to2 (since a +c=3, a can be 1 or 2). \n\na=1: c=2. 1*9 +2=11\u22609. \n\na=2: c=1. 2*9 +1=19\u22609. No solution.\n\ns=4 (16):\n\na +c=4. \n\nEquation:9a +c=16 \u21d29a + (4 -a)=16 \u21d28a +4=16 \u21d28a=12 \u21d2a=1.5. Not integer.\n\ns=5 (25):\n\na +c=5 \u21d2c=5 -a.\n\nEquation:9a +5 -a=25 \u21d28a=20 \u21d2a=2.5. Not integer.\n\ns=6 (36):\n\na +c=6 \u21d2c=6 -a.\n\nEquation:9a +6 -a=36 \u21d28a=30 \u21d2a=3.75. Not integer.\n\ns=7 (49):\n\na +c=7 \u21d2c=7 -a.\n\nEquation:9a +7 -a=49 \u21d28a=42 \u21d2a=5.25. Not integer.\n\ns=8 (64):\n\na +c=8 \u21d2c=8 -a.\n\nEquation:9a +8 -a=64 \u21d28a=56 \u21d2a=7. \n\nThus, a=7, c=1. 7*9 +1=64. \n\nCheck digits: 7 and1. Sum is8. sqrt(64)=8. So yes. \n\nThus, 64 is valid. \n\nThus, only one solution for b=9. \n\nHmm. \n\nb=10:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from10 to99.\n\nSquares up to 99: 16,25,36,49,64,81.\n\nCheck each:\n\ns=4 (16):\n\na*10 +c=16, a +c=4. \n\nThus, c=4 -a. \n\nSo 10a + (4 -a)=16 \u21d29a=12 \u21d2a=12/9=4/3. Not integer.\n\ns=5 (25):\n\na +c=5 \u21d2c=5 -a.\n\n10a +5 -a =25 \u21d29a=20 \u21d2a\u22482.22. No.\n\ns=6 (36):\n\nc=6 -a.\n\n10a +6 -a=36 \u21d29a=30 \u21d2a\u22483.333. No.\n\ns=7 (49):\n\nc=7 -a.\n\n10a +7 -a=49 \u21d29a=42 \u21d2a\u22484.666. No.\n\ns=8 (64):\n\nc=8 -a.\n\n10a +8 -a=64 \u21d29a=56 \u21d2a\u22486.222. No.\n\ns=9 (81):\n\nc=9 -a.\n\n10a +9 -a=81 \u21d29a=72 \u21d2a=8.\n\nThus, a=8, c=1. 8*10 +1=81. Sum 9. sqrt(81)=9. Correct. \n\nThus, only 81 is valid. So count=1. \n\nWait, but the problem statement says 81 is 13-eautiful, but in base10, it's also a two-digit number (81 is two digits in base10), so why isn't it considered 10-eautiful? Wait, because in base10, 81 is written as 8 and 1, which sum to 9, which is sqrt(81). Wait, but in base10, 81 is two digits, so it should be 10-eautiful. Wait, why did I not count it here?\n\nWait, let me recalculate:\n\nWait for b=10, s=9 (since sqrt(81)=9). \n\nThen, a +c=9, and n=81= a*10 +c. \n\nSo substituting c=9 -a:\n\n10a + (9 -a)=81 \u21d29a +9 =81 \u21d29a=72 \u21d2a=8. \n\nThus, a=8, c=1. \n\nWhich is exactly 81 in base10. So digits 8 and 1. Sum is 9. So yes, it is 10-eautiful. \n\nWait, so why did I think count was 1? Because 81 is valid. So why earlier steps?\n\nWait, let me check the previous steps again. \n\nWait when I considered s=9, I should have counted that. \n\nWait in my earlier step-by-step for b=10, I considered s=9:\n\ns=9 (81):\n\na +c=9, so c=9 -a.\n\nEquation:10a + (9 -a)=81 \u21d29a +9=81 \u21d29a=72 \u21d2a=8. \n\nThus, that's valid, so yes, 81 is valid. \n\nAdditionally, are there any others? \n\nWait let me check s= sqrt(25)=5:\n\nWait 25 is 25 in base10. Which is two digits: 2 and5. Sum is7\u22605. So no. \n\nWait 36 is 3 and6. Sum 9\u22606. \n\n49 is 4 and9. Sum 13\u22607. \n\n64 is 6 and4. Sum 10\u22608. \n\nThus, only 81. So count is1. Wait, but 81 is valid, so count is1? \n\nWait, but in the problem statement, they said 81 is 13-eautiful, but in base10 it's also 10-eautiful. So why is the count only 1? \n\nWait, perhaps I missed another number? Let me check s= sqrt(16)=4. \n\nWait 16 in base10 is 1 and6. Sum 7\u22604. \n\ns= sqrt(25)=5, which gives sum 7\u22605. \n\ns= sqrt(36)=6. 36 in base10 is 3 and6, sum 9\u22606. \n\ns= sqrt(49)=7. 4 and9, sum 13\u22607. \n\ns= sqrt(64)=8. 6 and4, sum10\u22608. \n\ns= sqrt(81)=9, which works. \n\ns= sqrt(100)=10, but 100 is three digits in base10. \n\nThus, only 81 is valid, so count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nContinuing to b=11:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from11 to 120 (since 11\u00b2-1=120). \n\nSquares up to 120: 16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121 (too big).\n\nCheck each s from ceil(sqrt(11))=4 to 10 (b-1=10).\n\ns=4 (16):\n\na*11 +c=16, a +c=4. \n\nc=4 -a. \n\nEquation:11a +4 -a =16 \u21d210a=12 \u21d2a=1.2. Not integer.\n\ns=5 (25):\n\nc=5 -a.\n\n11a +5 -a=25 \u21d210a=20 \u21d2a=2. \n\nThus, a=2, c=3. \n\nCheck: 2*11 +3=25. Sum 2+3=5=sqrt(25). So yes. \n\nThus, 25 is valid. \n\ns=6 (36):\n\nc=6 -a.\n\n11a +6 -a=36 \u21d210a=30 \u21d2a=3. \n\nThus, a=3, c=3. \n\nCheck: 3*11 +3=36. Sum 6. sqrt(36)=6. Yes. \n\ns=7 (49):\n\nc=7 -a.\n\n11a +7 -a=49 \u21d210a=42 \u21d2a=4.2. Not integer.\n\ns=8 (64):\n\nc=8 -a.\n\n11a +8 -a=64 \u21d210a=56 \u21d2a=5.6.

Correct. \n\nThus, for s=5,6,10, so three solutions: 25, 36, 100. \n\nWait, so count is 3? \n\nWait, let me verify each:\n\nFor s=5: 25 is 23_11? Wait no: 2*11 +3=25. Yes. \n\ns=6: 3*11 +3=36. \n\ns=10: 9*11 +1=100. \n\nThus, three numbers. \n\nTherefore, count=3 for b=11.\n\nContinuing to b=12:\n\nTwo-digit numbers from12 to 143.\n\nSquares up to 143: 16,25,36,49,64,81,100,121,144 (too big).\n\nSo s ranges from 4 to 11 (since b-1=11).\n\nCheck each s:\n\ns=4 (16):\n\na*12 +c=16, a +c=4.\n\nc=4 -a. \n\nEquation:12a +4 -a=16 \u21d211a=12 \u21d2a=12/11\u22481.09.

No.\n\ns=11 (121):\n\nc=11 -a.\n\n12a +11 -a=121 \u21d211a=110 \u21d2a=10. \n\nThus, a=10, c=1. \n\nCheck:10*12 +1=121. Sum 10+1=11=sqrt(121)=11. Correct. \n\nThus, only s=11 gives a solution. \n\nWait, but let me check s= sqrt(25)=5:\n\nWait, 25 in base12 is 21 (2*12 +1=25). Sum is 3\u22605. \n\nWait, but according to the equations above, s=5 didn't yield a solution. \n\nWait, but 25 in base12 is 21, so sum is 2+1=3\u22605. So no. \n\nSimilarly for 36 in base12 is 3*12 +0=36? No, 3*12=36, so it's 30_12, digits 3 and0. Sum 3\u22606. \n\nWait, 36 in base12 would be 30, but 3+0=3\u22606. \n\nWait, so perhaps only 121 is valid. \n\nWait, so count=1 for b=12?\n\nWait, but let me check s=10:\n\nWait, s=10: n=100. \n\na=8.18, which is not integer. \n\nThus only 121 is valid. \n\nHmm. \n\nContinuing to b=13:\n\nThe example given is 81 is 13-eautiful.

Maybe I need a better approach. \n\nLooking for when the count exceeds 10, so need to find a base where there are more than ten such numbers. \n\nLet me see if I can find a formula for the number of solutions for a given b.\n\nRecall that the equation is s(s-1) divisible by (b-1), and a = s(s-1)/(b-1) must be between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, given that a and c are digits in base b, so c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1. \n\nBut since s is between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, and a is between 1 and b-1, then c = s - a will be between (s - (b-1)) and (s -1). \n\nBut since s is at most b-1, s - (b-1) can be negative. So need to ensure that s - a \u22650 \u21d2 a \u2264 s. \n\nSo, given a = s(s-1)/(b-1), the conditions are:\n\n1. 1 \u2264 s(s-1)/(b-1) \u2264 b-1,\n\n2. s - [s(s-1)/(b-1)] \u22650 \u21d2 s \u2265 s(s-1)/(b-1),\n\nand \n\n3. s - [s(s-1)/(b-1)] \u2264 b-1 \u21d2 s - s(s-1)/(b-1) \u2264 b-1.\n\nThe first condition is already covered by the first inequality. \n\nAlternatively, the key is to find s such that (b-1) divides s(s-1), and a = s(s-1)/(b-1) must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 s (since c = s - a must be non-negative) and also a must be \u2264 b-1. \n\nSo for each b, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where s(s-1) divisible by (b-1) and s(s-1)/(b-1) is an integer between 1 and s. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps for a given b, the number of divisors of s(s-1) that equal (b-1). But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, notice that for a given b, the equation a = s(s-1)/(b-1) must be integer, so s(s-1) must be divisible by (b-1). \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that s(s-1) mod (b-1) =0. \n\nSo maybe the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in that interval where s \u22610 or 1 mod d, where d divides (b-1). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to consider that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, then (b-1) must divide s or s-1, but not necessarily entirely. \n\nWait, since s and s-1 are coprime, then any common divisor of s and s-1 must be 1. Therefore, the factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. \n\nTherefore, for (b-1) to divide s(s-1), it must be that all prime factors of (b-1) are present in either s or s-1. \n\nTherefore, for each divisor d of (b-1), we can have s \u22610 mod d and s \u22611 mod ( (b-1)/d ). \n\nBut this is getting into more number theory than I can handle quickly. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can think of s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). Let me denote k = b-1. Then, the equation is s(s-1) divisible by k. \n\nWe need to find the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod k. \n\nWait, since b =k+1, so sqrt(b) is sqrt(k+1). \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can consider for each k =b-1, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(k+1)), k] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod k. \n\nPerhaps the number of solutions s is equal to the number of integers s in that interval where s \u22610 mod d or s \u22611 mod d for some divisor d of k? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in that interval such that s \u22610 mod (k) or s \u22611 mod (k), but that's too restrictive. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps when k is small, the number of solutions is small, but as k increases, the number of solutions may increase. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps when k is a prime number, the only solutions are s=0 mod k (but s can't be 0) or s=1 mod k. But since s is between sqrt(k+1) and k, s=1 mod k would only be s=1, which is too small. So only s \u22610 mod k would be s=k, but s must be at most k, so s=k. Then s(k)=k*(k-1). So s(s-1)=k(k-1). Which is divisible by k, yes. So for prime k, only s=k gives a solution. \n\nThus, when b-1 is prime, the count is 1 (only s=b-1). \n\nBut when k is composite, there are more divisors, so more possible s. \n\nTherefore, to get more solutions, k should have many factors, so b-1 should be composite with many factors. \n\nThus, perhaps the minimal b would be when b-1 is a highly composite number. \n\nThe first few highly composite numbers are 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, etc. \n\nThus, trying b-1=12 (so b=13) gives count=3 (as before). \n\nb-1=24 (b=25) might give more. \n\nAlternatively, trying b=25, but that might take time. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b=16. Wait already did b=16, count=3. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b=12, count=1. \n\nWait, perhaps b=24? Let me try b=12:\n\nWait already did b=12, count=1. \n\nWait, perhaps b=24:\n\nb=24, so k=23 (prime). So count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait b=12 is 11, which is prime. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, let me try b=21 (k=20). \n\nLet me try b=21. \n\nb=21:\n\nk=20. \n\nWe need to find s in [ceil(sqrt(21)),20] which is [5,20]. \n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by 20. \n\n20 factors: 2^2*5. \n\nThus, s(s-1) must be divisible by 4 and 5. \n\nSince s and s-1 are coprime, so one must be divisible by 4, and one must be divisible by 5. \n\nEither:\n\nCase1: s divisible by 4 and s-1 divisible by 5. \n\nOr \n\nCase2: s divisible by5 and s-1 divisible by4. \n\nAdditionally, since they are consecutive, the divisibility can be checked. \n\nLet me look for s in 5-20 where either:\n\nCase1: s \u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod5. \n\nOr \n\nCase2: s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod4. \n\nSolve these congruences. \n\nCase1:\n\nFind s \u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod5. \n\nLet s=4a. Then 4a \u22611 mod5 \u21d24a \u22611 mod5 \u21d2a\u22614^{-1}*1 mod5. Since 4*4=16\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 inverse of 4 mod5 is4. Thus a\u22614 mod5. \n\nThus, a=5b +4. So s=4*(5b+4)=20b +16. \n\nWithin 5 to20:\n\nPossible b=0: s=16. \n\nb=1: s=36 which exceeds 20. \n\nThus only s=16. \n\nCase2:\n\ns\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod4. \n\nLet s=5a. Then 5a\u22611 mod4 \u21d25a \u22611 mod4 \u21d2a\u22611 mod4 (since 5\u22611 mod4). \n\nThus a=4b +1. \n\nThus s=5*(4b+1)=20b +5. \n\nWithin 5-20:\n\nb=0: s=5. \n\nb=1: s=25 which exceeds. \n\nThus s=5. \n\nAdditionally, check s=5 and s=16. \n\nAlso, maybe other solutions where s divisible by 20? \n\ns=20: 20 divides 20, so s=20. \n\nCheck s=20:\n\ns(s-1)=20*19 divisible by 20? Yes. \n\nThus, s=20 is also a solution. \n\nThus, total s values:5,16,20. \n\nCheck each:\n\nFor s=5:\n\na= s(s-1)/k =5*4/20=1. \n\nThus a=1, c=5-1=4. \n\nCheck:1*21 +4=25. sqrt(25)=5. Correct. \n\ns=16:\n\na=16*15/20=240/20=12. \n\nThus a=12, c=16-12=4. \n\nCheck:12*21 +4=252 +4=256. sqrt(256)=16. Correct. \n\ns=20:\n\na=20*19/20=19. \n\nThus a=19, c=20 -19=1. \n\nCheck:19*21 +1=399 +1=400. sqrt(400)=20. Correct. \n\nThus, three solutions. \n\nAdditionally, check if there are other solutions where s(s-1) divisible by 20 but not covered by cases above. \n\nFor example, s divisible by 5 and s-1 divisible by 4. \n\nWait, s=5: yes. \n\ns=16: divisible by4 and s-1=15 divisible by5. \n\ns=20: divisible by5, s-1=19 which isn't divisible by4, but s divisible by20, so overall divisible by20. \n\nThus total count=3. \n\nHmm, still low. \n\nTrying b=25 (k=24). \n\nb=25:\n\nk=24. \n\nWe need s in [5,24]. \n\ns(s-1) divisible by24. \n\n24=2^3*3. \n\nThus, s(s-1) must be divisible by 8 and 3. \n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive, one is even, so divisible by 2, but need divisibility by8 and 3. \n\nSo either:\n\nCase1: s divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by3, or \n\ns divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by8. \n\nOr other combinations where factors are spread between s and s-1. \n\nAlternatively, since they are coprime, the factors must be in one or the other. \n\nTo get divisibility by8 and3:\n\nEither:\n\n- s divisible by8 and s divisible by3 (so divisible by24) or s divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by3,\n\n- or s divisible by3 and s-1 divisible by8,\n\n- or s-1 divisible by both8 and3 (so s divisible by1 mod24). \n\nWait this is getting complex. \n\nAlternatively, the number of s in [5,24] such that s(s-1) divisible by24. \n\nPossible s where s or s-1 divisible by 8, and s or s-1 divisible by3. \n\nLet me list all s from5 to24 and check:\n\nCheck divisibility by24:\n\ns=5:5*4=20 \u2192 no.\n\n6:6*5=30 \u2192 30 divisible by6 but not 24.\n\n7:7*6=42 \u2192 divisible by6, not24.\n\n8:8*7=56 \u2192 divisible by8, but 56 mod3=2 \u2192 no.\n\n9:9*8=72 \u2192 divisible by8? 72/8=9. Yes. 72 divisible by24? 72/24=3. Yes. \n\nThus s=9 is okay. \n\n10:10*9=90 \u2192 divisible by 2*3*3*5 \u2192 24 not a factor. \n\n11:11*10=110 \u2192 no.\n\n12:12*11=132 \u2192132/24=5.5 \u2192 no.\n\n13:13*12=156 \u2192156/24=6.5 \u2192 no.\n\n14:14*13=182 \u2192 no.\n\n15:15*14=210 \u2192210/24=8.75 \u2192 no.\n\n16:16*15=240 \u2192240/24=10 \u2192 yes. \n\n17:17*16=272 \u2192272/24\u224811.33 \u2192 no.\n\n18:18*17=306 \u2192306/24=12.75 \u2192 no.\n\n19:19*18=342 \u2192 no.\n\n20:20*19=380 \u2192 no.\n\n21:21*20=420 \u2192420/24=17.5 \u2192 no.\n\n22:22*21=462 \u2192462/24=19.25 \u2192 no.\n\n23:23*22=506 \u2192 no.\n\n24:24*23=552 \u2192552/24=23 \u2192 yes. \n\nThus, s=9,16,24. \n\nCheck each:\n\nFor s=9:\n\na= s(s-1)/k=9*8/24=3. \n\nThus a=3, c=6. \n\nCheck:3*25 +6=75 +6=81. sqrt(81)=9. Correct. \n\ns=16:\n\na=16*15/24=10. \n\nThus a=10, c=6. \n\nWait c=16-10=6. \n\nCheck:10*25 +6=250 +6=256. sqrt(256)=16. Correct. \n\ns=24:\n\na=24*23/24=23. \n\nThus a=23, c=1. \n\nCheck:23*25 +1=575 +1=576. sqrt(576)=24. Correct. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nTrying b=24 (k=23, prime). \n\nWait b=24:\n\nk=23 (prime). So s must be divisible by23, so s=23. \n\nThus:\n\na=23*22/23=22. \n\nCheck:22*24 +1=528 +1=529. sqrt(529)=23. Correct. \n\nThus count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nTrying b=18 (k=17, prime). \n\nAlready did that, count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nTrying b=20 (k=19, prime). \n\nThus count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nMaybe b=28 (k=27). \n\nk=27=3^3. \n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by27. \n\nThus, since s and s-1 coprime, one must be divisible by27. \n\nThus s=27 or s-1=27. \n\nBut s \u226427 (since b=28, s up to27). \n\nThus s=27 or s=28? Wait s<=27. \n\nThus s=27 or s=28? Wait no. \n\nWait s must be in [5,27]. \n\nThus s=27 gives s-1=26. \n\nThus s=27: s divisible by27? 27 divides27, so yes. \n\nThus s=27: \n\na=27*26/27=26. \n\nCheck:26*28 +1=728 +1=729. sqrt(729)=27. Correct. \n\nAlso, s=28 is beyond the max s=27. \n\nAdditionally, s-1 divisible by27: s=28, which is too big. \n\nThus, only s=27. \n\nCount=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nTrying b=21 (k=20). \n\nEarlier found count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nMaybe try b=24 (k=23). \n\nAlready did that. \n\nHmm, this trial and error might not be effective. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the equation a = s(s-1)/(b-1). \n\nSince a must be \u2264s, then s(s-1)/(b-1) \u2264s \u21d2 (s-1)/(b-1) \u22641 \u21d2 s-1 \u2264b-1 \u21d2s \u2264b. Which holds since s is up to b-1. \n\nThus, the key condition is that s(s-1) must be divisible by (b-1). \n\nThus for each b, the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] where s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). \n\nTo maximize this count, (b-1) should have many divisors so that s(s-1) can be divisible by it in multiple ways. \n\nThus, b-1 should be a number with many factors. \n\nThe number of solutions is equal to the number of s in the interval where s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod d for each divisor d of (b-1). \n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s such that (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nThe number of such s in [1, b-1] is equal to the number of solutions to s(s-1)\u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nSince s and s-1 are consecutive, the solutions are s \u22610 or1 mod d for each divisor d of (b-1). \n\nBut this might be complex. \n\nAlternatively, note that the number of solutions s in [1,b-1] is equal to the number of divisors of (b-1), but not sure. \n\nAlternatively, the equation s(s-1) \u22610 mod k (where k =b-1) has solutions s\u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod (k/d) for each divisor d of k. \n\nThus, the total number of solutions is the sum over divisors d of k of \u03c6(d), but not exactly. \n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions modulo k is equal to the number of solutions to s \u22610 mod d or s\u22611 mod e where d and e are divisors such that d*e divides k? \n\nThis is getting too abstract. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the maximum number of solutions occurs when k is a factorial or highly composite. \n\nLet me try b=25 (k=24). \n\nEarlier count=3. \n\nTrying b=36 (k=35). \n\nk=35=5*7. \n\nWe need s(s-1) divisible by35. \n\nThus, s divisible by5 and s-1 divisible by7, or s divisible by7 and s-1 divisible by5. \n\nAlso, s divisible by35. \n\nLet me find s in [6,35]:\n\nCase1: s divisible by5, s-1 divisible by7. \n\ns=5a. \n\n5a -1 divisible by7 \u21d25a \u22611 mod7 \u21d2a\u22613 mod7 (since 5*3=15\u22611 mod7). \n\nThus a=7b +3. \n\nThus s=5*(7b +3)=35b +15. \n\nWithin 6-35:\n\nb=0: s=15. \n\nb=1: s=50>35. \n\nThus s=15. \n\nCase2: s divisible by7, s-1 divisible by5. \n\ns=7a. \n\n7a -1 divisible by5 \u21d27a\u22611 mod5 \u21d22a\u22611 mod5 \u21d2a\u22613 mod5 (2*3=6\u22611 mod5). \n\nThus a=5b+3. \n\nThus s=7*(5b+3)=35b+21. \n\nWithin 6-35:\n\nb=0: s=21. \n\nb=1: s=56>35. \n\nThus s=21. \n\nCase3: s divisible by35. \n\ns=35. \n\ns=35: s(s-1)=35*34 divisible by35. \n\nThus s=35. \n\nThus total solutions s=15,21,35. \n\nCheck each:\n\ns=15:\n\na=15*14/35=6. \n\nThus a=6, c=9. \n\nCheck:6*36 +9=216 +9=225. sqrt(225)=15.

Correct. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me try b= 21 (k=20). \n\nWe had count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait maybe b= 36 (k=35). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait maybe when k is a multiple of 6? \n\nWait b=7 (k=6). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait what about b= 6 (k=5). \n\nb=6:\n\nk=5. \n\ns in [3,5]. \n\ns(s-1) divisible by5. \n\nThus s divisible by5 or s-1 divisible by5. \n\nThus s=5 or s=1. \n\nBut s\u22653, so s=5. \n\nThus count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, perhaps the maximum count is 3 for many bases. \n\nWait, but the problem states that there is an example with count=10. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when b-1 has many factors, such that there are multiple s in the interval. \n\nWait, perhaps when b-1 is a factorial, like 6 (b=7), count=3. \n\nWait maybe b= 12 (k=11). \n\nCount=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe b= 100 (k=99). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait let me try b= 121 (k=120). \n\nk=120=2^3*3*5. \n\nThus, s(s-1) divisible by120. \n\nThis requires divisible by 8,3,5. \n\nThus:\n\nEither:\n\n- s divisible by8 and s divisible by3 and5, \n\nOr combinations where factors are spread between s and s-1. \n\nThis could have many solutions. \n\nLet me see:\n\ns(s-1) divisible by8,3,5. \n\nPossible scenarios:\n\nCase1: s divisible by8, s-1 divisible by15. \n\nCase2: s divisible by15, s-1 divisible by8. \n\nCase3: s divisible by40 (LCM of8 and5), s divisible by3. \n\nEtc. \n\nThis is getting too involved. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions increases when k is divisible by multiple small factors. \n\nBut I need a better approach. \n\nWait, going back to the equation a = s(s-1)/(b-1). \n\nTo have a be integer, s(s-1) must be divisible by (b-1). \n\nFor each s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1, if s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1), then that s contributes a solution. \n\nThus the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in that interval where s(s-1) mod (b-1)=0. \n\nTo find the minimal b where this count exceeds10, perhaps I can look for b-1 being a highly composite number with many divisors. \n\nThe most highly composite numbers are like 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, etc. \n\nLet me try b= 61 (k=60). \n\nk=60=2^2*3*5. \n\nWe need s in [8,60]. \n\ns(s-1) divisible by60. \n\nSince 60=4*3*5. \n\nThus, the product s(s-1) must be divisible by4,3,5. \n\nPossible cases:\n\nEither s divisible by4,3,5 or combinations. \n\nThis can be split into cases where:\n\nEither:\n\n- s divisible by4, s divisible by3, and s divisible by5 (i.e., divisible by60), \n\nor \n\n- s divisible by4, and s-1 divisible by3 and5, \n\nor \n\n- s divisible by3, and s-1 divisible by4 and5, \n\nor \n\n- s divisible by5, and s-1 divisible by4 and3, \n\nor \n\n- s divisible by4 and3, and s-1 divisible by5, \n\nand so on. \n\nThis is complicated, but perhaps we can find multiple s that satisfy these conditions. \n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in [8,60] where s \u22610 or1 mod d for some divisor d of60. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are many s that satisfy this. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of s such that s \u22610 mod4, s\u22610 mod3, s\u22610 mod5 \u21d2 s\u22610 mod60 \u21d2 s=60. \n\ns=60: \n\na=60*59/60=59. \n\nThus a=59, c=1. \n\nCheck:59*61 +1=3599+1=3600. sqrt(3600)=60. Correct. \n\ns=60 is one. \n\ns=59: \n\nCheck s=59:\n\n59*58=3422. 3422 mod60=3422-57*60=3422-3420=2. Not divisible by60. \n\ns=58: \n\n58*57=3306. 3306 mod60=6.

Thus divisible. \n\nThus s=40:\n\na=40*39/60= (40/60)*39= (2/3)*39=26. \n\nThus a=26, c=14. \n\nCheck:26*61 +14=1586 +14=1600. sqrt(1600)=40. Correct. \n\nSimilarly, s=40 is valid. \n\ns=35:\n\n35*34=1190 mod60=1190-19*60=1190-1140=50. Not divisible. \n\ns=30:\n\n30*29=870 mod60=0. \n\nThus s=30:\n\na=30*29/60= (30/60)*29=0.5*29=14.5. Not integer. Wait no, 30*29=870. 870/60=14.5. Not integer. \n\nHmm, so not valid. \n\nWait, but s(s-1)=30*29=870. 870 divisible by60? 60*14=840, 60*14.5=870. So yes divisible by60, but 14.5 is not integer. \n\nWait, but a must be integer. \n\nWait the equation requires that (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nYes, but a must be integer. \n\nWait, but in this case, a= s(s-1)/(b-1)=870/60=14.5. Not integer. \n\nThus, s=30 is not a solution. \n\nHmm, so even though divisible by60, a is not integer. \n\nThus my mistake earlier. \n\nThus need s(s-1) divisible by60 and s(s-1)/60 must be integer. \n\nThus s=30 gives a=14.5, which is not integer. So not valid. \n\nThus, s=40 gives a=26. \n\nSimilarly, s=45:\n\n45*44=1980 mod60=0. \n\nThus s=45:\n\na=45*44/60= (45/60)*44= (3/4)*44=33. \n\nThus a=33, c=12. \n\nCheck:33*61 +12=2013+12=2025. sqrt(2025)=45. Correct. \n\ns=45 is valid. \n\ns=25:\n\n25*24=600 mod60=0. \n\na=600/60=10. \n\nThus a=10, c=15. \n\nCheck:10*61 +15=610+15=625. sqrt(625)=25.

Correct. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nThis is frustrating. \n\nWait maybe b= 60 (k=59). \n\nk=59 is prime. \n\nThus s=59. \n\nThus count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait perhaps b= 121 (k=120). \n\nEarlier count was6. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait let me try b= 25 (k=24). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait maybe I need to try b= 100 (k=99). \n\nWait tried that, count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait perhaps I need to consider when k is a multiple of many small numbers. \n\nWait, let me try b= 25 (k=24). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait maybe b= 21 (k=20). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I need to try b= 36 (k=35). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, maybe there's a different approach. \n\nRecall the equation:\n\ns(s-1) = (b-1)*a \n\nSince a must be between1 and s (since c = s -a \u22650), \n\nthen:\n\ns(s-1)/(b-1) = a \u2264s \u21d2 s-1 \u2264b-1 \u21d2b\u2265 s. \n\nBut since b > s (since s \u2264b-1), so equality when s=b-1. \n\nThus, the maximum possible s is b-1. \n\nThe equation is s(s-1) divisible by (b-1). \n\nLet me set s =b-1. \n\nThen, s(s-1)= (b-1)(b-2). \n\nThus, (b-1)(b-2) divisible by (b-1) \u21d2 yes, so s=b-1 is always a solution. \n\nThus, for any b\u22652, s=b-1 is a solution. \n\nThus, there is at least one solution for any b. \n\nAdditionally, other solutions may exist. \n\nThus, the total number of solutions is at least1. \n\nTo have more than10 solutions, need many s in the interval [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] that satisfy the divisibility. \n\nPerhaps when b-1 is a factorial number. \n\nLet me try b= 120 (k=119). \n\nBut that had count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me try b= 25 (k=24). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to try b= 100 (k=99). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait perhaps b= 105 (k=104). \n\nk=104=8*13. \n\nThus s(s-1) divisible by104. \n\nThus divisible by8 and13. \n\nSince s and s-1 coprime, so one divisible by8 and the other divisible by13, or one divisible by104. \n\nCase1: s divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by13. \n\ns=8a. \n\n8a-1 \u22610 mod13 \u21d28a\u22611 mod13 \u21d2a\u22615 mod13 (8*5=40\u22611 mod13). \n\nThus a=13b+5 \u21d2 s=8*(13b+5)=104b +40. \n\nWithin s in [11,104]: \n\nb=0: s=40. \n\nb=1: s=144>104. \n\nThus s=40. \n\nCase2: s divisible by13 and s-1 divisible by8. \n\ns=13a. \n\n13a -1 \u22610 mod8 \u21d213a\u22611 mod8 \u21d25a\u22611 mod8 \u21d2a\u22615 mod8 (5*5=25\u22611 mod8). \n\nThus a=8b+5 \u21d2 s=13*(8b+5)=104b+65. \n\nWithin s in [11,104]: \n\nb=0: s=65. \n\nb=1: s=169>104. \n\nThus s=65. \n\nCase3: s divisible by104. \n\ns=104. \n\nThus s=104. \n\nThus solutions s=40,65,104. \n\nCheck:\n\ns=40:\n\na=40*39/104= (40/104)*39= (10/26)*39= (5/13)*39=15. \n\nThus a=15, c=25. \n\nCheck:15*105 +25=1575+25=1600. sqrt(1600)=40.

Correct. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps b= 120 (k=119). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe b= 2520 (k=2519). \n\nBut that's too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that I'm missing something in the equations. \n\nLet me revisit the equation: \n\na = s(s-1)/(b-1). \n\nThus, for a to be an integer between1 and s, we have:\n\n1 \u2264 s(s-1)/(b-1) \u2264 s. \n\nThe first inequality gives:\n\ns(s-1)/(b-1) \u22651 \u21d2 s(s-1) \u2265 b-1. \n\nThe second inequality gives:\n\ns(s-1)/(b-1) \u2264 s \u21d2 s-1 \u2264 b-1 \u21d2 s \u2264 b. \n\nWhich holds since s \u2264b-1. \n\nThus, the key is that s(s-1) \u2265 b-1 and divisible by (b-1). \n\nThus, s(s-1) must be a multiple of (b-1) and at least (b-1). \n\nThus, the minimal multiple is (b-1) itself. \n\nThus, when s(s-1) = (b-1)*k, where k is integer between1 and s. \n\nThus, the number of solutions is the number of integers s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nTo maximize the number of solutions, (b-1) should have many divisors, so that s(s-1) can be multiples of (b-1) for many s. \n\nThus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in the interval where s \u22610 or1 mod d for each divisor d of (b-1). \n\nBut this is still vague. \n\nAlternatively, note that for each divisor d of (b-1), there can be solutions where s \u22610 mod d and s-1 \u22610 mod ( (b-1)/d ). \n\nThus, the number of solutions is the number of divisors d of (b-1) such that there exists s in the interval satisfying those congruences. \n\nThe number of such solutions would be the number of divisors d of (b-1), which for highly composite (b-1) can be large. \n\nThus, perhaps the minimal b where (b-1) has more than 10 divisors would give the required count. \n\nThe number of divisors function \u03c4(k) for a number k. \n\nWe need \u03c4(k) >10. \n\nThe smallest k with \u03c4(k) >10 is 60 (\u03c4(60)=12). \n\nThus if we take b-1=60, so b=61. \n\nEarlier tried b=61 and found count=6. \n\nHmm, but \u03c4(60)=12, but the count was6. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait \u03c4(k) is the number of divisors, but the number of solutions s would be less because each divisor pair may give one solution. \n\nThus, perhaps we need \u03c4(k) to be even higher. \n\nNext highly composite number after60 is 120 (\u03c4(120)=16). \n\nThus b=121 (k=120). \n\nEarlier tried b=121, count=6. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to try b= 2520 (k=2519). \n\nBut that's too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait let's try b= 24 (k=23). \n\nCount=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem requires a different approach. \n\nLet me think of s and a. \n\nFrom the equation a = s(s-1)/(b-1), \n\nthen b-1 = s(s-1)/a. \n\nSince b must be an integer greater than s (since s \u2264b-1), \n\nthen b = s(s-1)/a +1. \n\nThus, for each pair (a,s) with 1\u2264a \u2264s and s \u2265ceil(sqrt(b)), \n\nthen b must be equal to s(s-1)/a +1. \n\nThus, for each a and s with 1\u2264a \u2264s, \n\nb = s(s-1)/a +1. \n\nThus, to find all b-eautiful numbers, we can iterate over possible a and s, compute b, and collect all n =s\u00b2 for each b. \n\nThus, to find the minimal b where there are more than10 such numbers, we can look for b that can be expressed as (s(s-1)/a)+1 for many pairs (a,s). \n\nThus, to maximize the count, we need b to be expressible as s(s-1)/a +1 in many ways. \n\nThus, the number of representations of b-1 as s(s-1)/a for integers a,s with 1\u2264a \u2264s and s(s-1)/a integer. \n\nThus, the number of factor pairs (a, s(s-1)/a) of (b-1). \n\nWait, since b-1 = s(s-1)/a \u21d2 a must be a divisor of s(s-1). \n\nThus, for each divisor a of s(s-1), with 1\u2264a \u2264s, then b= s(s-1)/a +1. \n\nThus, the number of solutions for a given b is equal to the number of pairs (s,a) where a divides s(s-1), a \u2264s, and b= s(s-1)/a +1. \n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of divisors a of s(s-1) such that a \u2264s and s(s-1)/a =b-1. \n\nThus, for each divisor a of (b-1), we can set s(s-1) = a*(b-1). \n\nThus, solving s^2 -s - a*(b-1)=0. \n\nThe solutions are s=(1 \u00b1 sqrt(1 +4a(b-1)))/2. \n\nThus, for s to be integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square: 1 +4a(b-1)=k\u00b2. \n\nThis approach might be too involved. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for b where b-1 has many factor pairs (a, d) such that a*d = s(s-1) for some s. \n\nThus, the number of such s is the number of ways to write s(s-1) as a product of two factors a and d with a \u2264s and d =b-1. \n\nThus, for each b, the count is the number of s where s(s-1) can be divided into a and d with a \u2264s and d =b-1. \n\nThus, the number of s where b-1 divides s(s-1), which is what I was doing before. \n\nHmm. \n\nGiven that my trials up to b=121 only give counts up to6, perhaps I need to consider higher bases. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in my approach. \n\nWait, in the example given, b=13 has 81 as a solution, but there are other solutions as well. \n\nWait let me recheck b=13:\n\nFor b=13, k=12. \n\ns(s-1) divisible by12. \n\nPossible s from4 to12. \n\ns=4:4*3=12 divisible by12 \u21d2 yes. \n\nThus s=4: \n\na=4*3/12=1. \n\nThus a=1, c=3. \n\nCheck:1*13 +3=16. sqrt(16)=4. Correct. \n\ns=9: \n\n9*8=72 divisible by12 \u21d2 yes. \n\nThus s=9: a=72/12=6. \n\nCheck:6*13+3=81. Correct. \n\ns=12: \n\n12*11=132 divisible by12 \u21d2 yes. \n\nThus s=12: a=132/12=11. \n\nCheck:11*13 +1=143+1=144. sqrt(144)=12. Correct. \n\nThus total solutions s=4,9,12. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nWait, so three solutions. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe the minimal b is 121, with count=6. \n\nWait but the problem says \"more than ten\", so need count>10. \n\nHmm, perhaps I need to think of b where b-1 is a factorial. \n\nLet me try b= 721 (k=720). \n\nk=720=2^4*3^2*5. \n\nThus, the number of divisors is (4+1)(2+1)(1+1)=5*3*2=30. \n\nThus, there are30 divisors. \n\nThus, potentially, there could be many solutions. \n\nBut this is getting too big. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but I need to find when count exceeds10. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error in my approach and I need to consider that when s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1), but a can be any divisor, not necessarily the one from the equation. \n\nWait, but the equation requires a = s(s-1)/(b-1). \n\nThus, for each s in the interval, if (b-1) divides s(s-1), then it's a solution. \n\nThus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nThus, the problem reduces to finding the smallest b where this count exceeds10. \n\nTo find this, perhaps I can write a program, but since I'm doing this manually, let me try b= 240 (k=239). \n\nk=239 is prime. Thus count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nb= 252 (k=251). \n\nPrime. Count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nb= 240 (k=239). \n\nHmm. \n\nWait let's try b= 100 (k=99). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps b= 60 (k=59). \n\nPrime. Count=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 121, but even then count=6. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait perhaps I made a mistake in my previous trials. \n\nWait let me try b= 25 (k=24). \n\nCount=3. \n\nWait maybe b= 105 (k=104). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait let me think of when s(s-1) can be divisible by (b-1) for many s. \n\nSuppose (b-1) is 24 (b=25). \n\nThen, s(s-1) divisible by24. \n\nPossible s from5 to24. \n\ns=8: divisible by8 and s-1 divisible by3 (7 divisible by3? No). \n\nWait 8*7=56 not divisible by24. \n\nWait earlier for b=25, s=9,16,24. \n\nThus count=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait maybe b= 12 (k=11). \n\nCount=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nHmm, this is perplexing. Maybe the problem requires a different insight. \n\nWait, let me think of the equation again:\n\nThe two-digit number in base b is n = a*b +c, with a from1 tob-1 and c from0 tob-1. \n\nThe sum a +c = sqrt(n). \n\nThus, n must be a perfect square, so let n = s\u00b2. \n\nThus, s\u00b2 = a*b +c, with a +c = s. \n\nThus, substituting c = s -a into the first equation gives:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + (s -a) \u21d2 s\u00b2 -s = a*(b -1). \n\nThus, for each s, a must be (s\u00b2 -s)/(b -1). \n\nThus, for a to be an integer between1 and b-1, \n\n(b-1) must divide s(s-1), and \n\n1 \u2264 (s(s-1))/(b-1) \u2264 b-1. \n\nThe second inequality implies s(s-1) \u2264 (b-1)^2. \n\nThus, s must be \u2264b-1 (since s(s-1) \u2264 (b-1)^2 \u21d2 s \u2264b). \n\nThus, the possible s are from ceil(sqrt(b)) up to b-1. \n\nThe number of solutions is the number of s in this interval where (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nTo have more than10 solutions, we need many s in this interval divisible by (b-1) or adjacent to a multiple. \n\nPerhaps when (b-1) is a perfect square. \n\nWait, let me try b= 25 (k=24). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, when (b-1) is a multiple of many small numbers. \n\nLet me try b= 36 (k=35). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider that when (b-1) is a multiple of 6, there are more solutions. \n\nWait, but I tried b=6 (k=5). \n\nCount=1. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 100. \n\nWait let me try b= 120 (k=119). \n\nCount=3. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that when (b-1) is a factorial. \n\nFor example, b= 721 (k=720). \n\nBut this is too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal b is 121. \n\nWait, but I need to find the minimal b where count exceeds10. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, let me try b= 121 (k=120). \n\nEarlier count=6. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, perhaps the minimal b is 2521 (k=2520). \n\nBut this is too big. \n\nHmm. \n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that for each s from1 to b-1, there is a solution. \n\nWait, but s must be at least ceil(sqrt(b)). \n\nThus, the number of solutions is roughly b - ceil(sqrt(b)). \n\nThus, to have more than10 solutions, need b - sqrt(b) >10. \n\nSolving b - sqrt(b) >10. \n\nLet me set x= sqrt(b). \n\nThus, x\u00b2 -x >10 \u21d2x\u00b2 -x -10>0. \n\nSolutions x> (1 +sqrt(41))/2 \u2248 (1+6.4)/2\u22483.7. \n\nThus, when x>3.7, so b>13.69. \n\nThus for b>14, this inequality holds. \n\nBut this is just the number of possible s, but not the actual count of solutions. \n\nThus, the actual count is the number of s in that interval where (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nThus, to have count>10, need at least11 s's in the interval where (b-1) divides s(s-1). \n\nThus, the minimal b where this occurs would be when (b-1) has many factors so that many s's satisfy the divisibility. \n\nThe minimal such b would be when (b-1) is a number with many divisors. \n\nThe first number with more than10 divisors is 60 (\u03c4(60)=12). \n\nThus, b=61. \n\nEarlier for b=61, count=6. \n\nHmm, but \u03c4(60)=12, but count=6. \n\nPerhaps I need a number with \u03c4(k)=24, like 360. \n\n\u03c4(360)=24. \n\nThus b=361 (k=360). \n\nThus, trying b=361 (k=360). \n\nk=360=2^3*3^2*5. \n\nThus, the number of divisors is (3+1)(2+1)(1+1)=4*3*2=24. \n\nThus, potentially many solutions. \n\nLet me see how many s satisfy s(s-1) divisible by360. \n\ns in [19,360]. \n\nThis would take time, but let's try a few. \n\ns=20:\n\n20*19=380 mod360=20. Not divisible. \n\ns=24:\n\n24*23=552 mod360=552-360=192. Not divisible. \n\ns=25:\n\n25*24=600 mod360=600-360=240. Not divisible. \n\ns=30:\n\n30*29=870 mod360=870-2*360=870-720=150. Not divisible. \n\ns=36:\n\n36*35=1260 mod360=0. \n\nThus s=36: \n\na=1260/360=3.5. Not integer. \n\nHmm. \n\ns=40:\n\n40*39=1560 mod360=1560-4*360=1560-1440=120. Not divisible. \n\ns=45:\n\n45*44=1980 mod360=0. \n\nThus s=45: \n\na=1980/360=5.5. Not integer. \n\nHmm. \n\ns=48:\n\n48*47=2256 mod360=2256-6*360=2256-2160=96. Not divisible. \n\ns=50:\n\n50*49=2450 mod360=2450-6*360=2450-2160=290. Not divisible. \n\ns=60:\n\n60*59=3540 mod360=3540-9*360=3540-3240=300. Not divisible. \n\ns=72:\n\n72*71=5112 mod360=5112-14*360=5112-5040=72. Not divisible. \n\ns=80:\n\n80*79=6320 mod360=6320-17*360=6320-6120=200. Not divisible. \n\ns=90:\n\n90*89=8010 mod360=8010-22*360=8010-7920=90. Not divisible. \n\ns=100:\n\n100*99=9900 mod360=0. \n\nThus s=100:\n\na=9900/360=27.5. Not integer. \n\nHmm. \n\ns=120:\n\n120*119=14280 mod360=0. \n\nThus a=14280/360=39.666. Not integer. \n\nHmm. \n\ns= 144:\n\n144*143=20592 mod360=20592-57*360=20592-20520=72. Not divisible. \n\nHmm. \n\ns= 180:\n\n180*179=32220 mod360=0. \n\na=32220/360=90. \n\nThus a=90, c=180-90=90. \n\nCheck:90*361 +90=32490+90=32580. sqrt(32580)\u2248180.5. Not integer. \n\nWait, no. \n\nWait, s must be sqrt(n). \n\nWait n= s\u00b2. \n\nThus, if s=180, then n=180\u00b2=32400. \n\nThus, a*b +c =32400. \n\nWith a=32400/360=90. \n\nThus a=90, c=180 -90=90. \n\nCheck:90*361 +90=90*(361+1)=90*362=32580. \n\nBut 180\u00b2=32400\u226032580. \n\nThus, this is incorrect. \n\nWait, what's wrong here. \n\nWait, the equation is s\u00b2 =a*b +c. \n\nWith b=361, a=90, c=90. \n\nThus 90*361 +90= 90*(361+1)=90*362=32580. \n\nBut s= sqrt(32580) \u2248180.5, not integer. \n\nThus, my mistake: s must be integer. \n\nThus s=180 gives n=32400. \n\nThus, a*b +c=32400. \n\nThus, a= (s\u00b2 -s)/(b-1)= (180\u00b2 -180)/360= (32400-180)/360=32220/360=90. \n\nThus, a=90, c= s -a=180-90=90. \n\nThus, the number is a*b +c=90*361 +90=32580, which is not s\u00b2=32400. \n\nThus, this is a contradiction. \n\nWait, so my mistake is that s must satisfy s\u00b2= a*b +c. \n\nThus, in this case, the equation s\u00b2 = a*b +c must hold. \n\nThus, s=180 gives a=90, c=90. \n\nThus, n=90*361 +90=90*(361+1)=90*362=32580. \n\nBut s=180, so s\u00b2=32400\u226032580. \n\nThus, this is invalid. \n\nThus, my earlier assumption that s(s-1) divisible by k implies the solution is incorrect. \n\nWait, what's wrong here? \n\nAh, the equation is s\u00b2 = a*b +c. \n\nWith a= s(s-1)/(b-1), and c= s -a. \n\nThus, substituting: \n\ns\u00b2 = [s(s-1)/(b-1)]*b + (s - [s(s-1)/(b-1)]) \n\nLet me check this: \n\nLeft side: s\u00b2 \n\nRight side: [s(s-1)b/(b-1)] + s - [s(s-1)/(b-1)] \n\n= [s(s-1)b/(b-1) - s(s-1)/(b-1)] + s \n\n= [s(s-1)(b -1)/(b-1)] + s \n\n= s(s-1) + s \n\n= s\u00b2 -s +s \n\n= s\u00b2. \n\nThus, the equation holds. \n\nThus, the solution is valid. \n\nThus, in the case above, s=180, b=361, gives n= s\u00b2=32400. \n\nBut the actual value computed is 32580. \n\nWait, discrepancy. \n\nWait, let me recompute: \n\na = s(s-1)/(b-1) =180*179/360= (180/360)*179=0.5*179=89.5 \n\nAh! Here's the mistake! \n\nWait, s(s-1) =180*179=32220. \n\nDivided by b-1=360 gives 32220/360=89.5, which is not integer. \n\nThus, s=180 does not satisfy the divisibility condition. \n\nThus my earlier mistake was in thinking s=180 would work",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The question is about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nLet me start by understanding what exactly a two-digit number in base b means. In any base b, a two-digit number can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be between 1 and b-1 (since the first digit can't be zero), and c is between 0 and b-1. So both a and c are integers in those ranges.\n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits, a + c, should equal the square root of n. So, mathematically, we have:\n\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nBut since n is equal to a*b + c, substituting that in, we get:\n\na + c = sqrt(a*b + c)\n\nHmm, okay. So we need to solve this equation for integers a and c with the constraints 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1. \n\nTo make this easier, maybe square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me try that:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nLet me rearrange all terms to one side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms differently. Let me see if I can collect like terms. Let's see:\n\na\u00b2 - a*b + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps grouping terms with a:\n\na\u00b2 + a*(2c - b) + (c\u00b2 - c) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Maybe solving for a in terms of c and b would be helpful here. Let's write that equation again:\n\na\u00b2 + (2c - b)a + (c\u00b2 - c) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula for a:\n\na = [-(2c - b) \u00b1 sqrt((2c - b)^2 - 4*1*(c\u00b2 - c))]/2\n\nLet me compute the discriminant D:\n\nD = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(c\u00b2 - c)\n\nExpanding (2c - b)^2:\n\n4c\u00b2 -4b c + b\u00b2 -4c\u00b2 +4c = ?\n\nWait, let me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: (2c - b)^2 = 4c\u00b2 - 4b c + b\u00b2\n\nSecond term: -4*(c\u00b2 - c) = -4c\u00b2 +4c\n\nSo adding those together:\n\n4c\u00b2 -4b c + b\u00b2 -4c\u00b2 +4c = (-4b c +4c) + (4c\u00b2 -4c\u00b2) + b\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (-4c(b -1)) + 0 + b\u00b2\n\nSo D = b\u00b2 -4c(b -1)\n\nTherefore, the discriminant simplifies to D = b\u00b2 -4c(b -1)\n\nFor a to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Let me note that.\n\nMoreover, since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the solutions for a must satisfy that. So perhaps we can approach this by considering possible values of c and see for which b this equation holds?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach the problem by expressing n in terms of a and c, and then setting up the equation a + c = sqrt(n) = sqrt(a b + c). Let me see if there's another way to manipulate this equation.\n\nLet me denote s = a + c, so that s = sqrt(n). Then n = s\u00b2. But n is also equal to a*b + c. Therefore, s\u00b2 = a*b + c.\n\nBut since s = a + c, we can substitute c = s - a into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + (s - a)\n\nSimplify:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + s - a\n\nRearranged:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = a*(b -1)\n\nTherefore:\n\na = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nHmm, interesting. So a must be equal to (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Since a has to be an integer between 1 and b-1, the numerator (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be an integer a in that range. Also, c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nLet me note that s = a + c, so s must be at least 1 (since a is at least 1 and c is non-negative). Also, since n = s\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, the maximum value of n is b\u00b2 -1 (since the largest two-digit number in base b is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1). Therefore, s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1, so s \u2264 b -1. Since s is a positive integer, s can range from 1 up to b-1. Wait, but s must also be such that a and c are digits in base b. Let's see:\n\nSince a is between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1, so:\n\n0 \u2264 s - a \u2264 b -1\n\nBut since a \u22651, s - a \u2264 s -1. So to have c non-negative, s - a \u22650 => a \u2264 s.\n\nAlso, c = s - a must be \u2264 b-1, so s -a \u2264 b-1 => a \u2265 s - (b -1). But since a is at least 1, this gives a lower bound of a \u2265 max(1, s - b +1).\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting a bit too abstract. Let me think again.\n\nFrom the equation a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), since a must be an integer, (b -1) divides (s\u00b2 - s). Let me denote that (b-1) divides s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, the factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. \n\nTherefore, (b -1) must be a divisor of s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, the divisor (b-1) must be a product of a divisor of s and a divisor of s-1. \n\nAlternatively, since (b -1) divides s(s-1), then b-1 divides s(s-1). So for each possible s, the possible values of b-1 are the divisors of s(s-1). Therefore, for each s, the possible b's are divisors of s(s-1) plus 1. \n\nBut perhaps the key idea here is that for a given s, the possible bases b are (divisors of s(s-1) +1). But since we need to count the number of b-eautiful numbers for each b, maybe it's better to approach the problem by considering for each base b, how many pairs (a,c) satisfy the conditions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express s in terms of b and then find the number of possible s values.\n\nWait, let's go back to the equation:\n\na = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nSince a must be between 1 and b-1, inclusive, then:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nMultiply all parts by (b -1):\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nSo s\u00b2 - s must be between (b -1) and (b -1)^2. Let me denote that as:\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nAdditionally, since s must be such that c = s - a is between 0 and b-1, and a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), then substituting a into c:\n\nc = s - (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to approach this step by step with examples.\n\nThe problem states that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is 63, which sums to 9, and sqrt(81) is 9. Let's verify that:\n\nIn base 13, 6*13 + 3 = 78 +3 =81. The digits sum to 6+3=9, which is sqrt(81). That works.\n\nSo in that case, s =9, and b=13. Let's see how that fits into the equations above.\n\nUsing the equation a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1):\n\na = (81 -9)/(12) = 72/12 =6, which matches the first digit. Then c = s - a =9 -6=3, which is the second digit. So that works.\n\nSo, perhaps for each base b, we can find all possible s (the square roots) such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), and then check that a and c are within the required digit ranges.\n\nTherefore, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s such that:\n\n1. s\u00b2 = n is a two-digit number in base b, so s\u00b2 < b\u00b2 (since the maximum two-digit number in base b is b\u00b2 -1). Therefore, s must be less than b. Since s is sqrt(n) and n is two-digit, s can be from 1 up to b-1.\n\n2. (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), so (b -1) divides s(s -1).\n\n3. The resulting a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1, and c = s - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo, given that, perhaps for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s between 1 and b-1 such that:\n\n- (b -1) divides s(s -1), and\n\n- a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) is between 1 and b-1,\n\nand then also check that c = s - a is between 0 and b-1. But since a is (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), and c = s - a, perhaps the constraints on c are automatically satisfied?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nGiven that a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), and c = s - a,\n\nthen c = s - (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) = [s(b -1) - s\u00b2 + s]/(b -1)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\ns(b -1) - s\u00b2 + s = s(b -1 +1) - s\u00b2 = s*b - s\u00b2 = s(b - s)\n\nThus, c = [s(b - s)] / (b -1)\n\nHmm, so c must be an integer between 0 and b-1. Since s and b are positive integers with s < b (since s \u2264 b-1), then (b - s) is positive, so numerator is s*(b - s). Therefore, c is equal to [s(b - s)]/(b -1). Therefore, in addition to (b -1) dividing s(s -1), it must also divide s(b - s). \n\nWait, but since c must be an integer, the numerator s(b - s) must be divisible by (b -1). So that's another condition. However, since (b -1) divides s(s -1), maybe this is automatically satisfied? Let me see:\n\nSuppose that (b -1) divides s(s -1). Let me see if that implies that (b -1) divides s(b - s):\n\nLet me compute s(b - s) = s b - s\u00b2. \n\nBut from the previous equation, s\u00b2 - s = a*(b -1). Therefore, s\u00b2 = a(b -1) + s. \n\nTherefore, substituting into s b - s\u00b2:\n\ns b - [a(b -1) + s] = s b - a(b -1) - s = s(b -1) - a(b -1) = (s - a)(b -1)\n\nTherefore, s(b - s) = (s - a)(b -1). Therefore, c = [s(b - s)]/(b -1) = (s - a). But s - a is exactly c, which is an integer. So that checks out. So the c being an integer is already enforced by a being an integer. Therefore, as long as (b -1) divides s(s -1), then c is automatically an integer, and since a and c must be digits, their ranges are:\n\na must be between 1 and b-1,\n\nc must be between 0 and b-1,\n\nand since c = s - a, then:\n\nc = s - a must be between 0 and b-1,\n\nso 0 \u2264 s - a \u2264 b -1,\n\nwhich is equivalent to:\n\na \u2264 s \u2264 a + (b -1).\n\nBut since a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), this might need some more constraints, but perhaps as long as s is between 1 and b-1, and a is in the correct range, c will be okay. Let's see:\n\nSuppose s is between 1 and b -1. Let me also note that since a must be at least 1, then (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u22651,\n\nso s\u00b2 - s \u2265 b -1,\n\nand since a must be \u2264 b -1,\n\nthen (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1,\n\nso s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nTherefore, the inequalities we had before.\n\nSo putting this all together, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s between 1 and b-1 (inclusive) such that (b -1) divides s(s -1). \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to, for each b \u22652, count the number of s in [1, b-1] such that (b -1) divides s(s -1). We need to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nSo our task is to find the minimal b where the number of integers s in 1 to b-1 with s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1) is greater than 10.\n\nAlternatively, since (b -1) divides s(s -1), we can think of this as s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of s in [1, b-1] satisfying s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nTo find the minimal b where this count is >10.\n\nHmm, so maybe we can rephrase the problem in terms of divisors. Let me denote d = b -1, so d = b -1, so b = d +1. Then the problem becomes, for d \u22651, find the minimal d +1 (i.e., minimal b) such that the number of s in [1, d] with s(s -1) \u22610 mod d exceeds 10. Then the answer will be d +1.\n\nSo now, the problem is in terms of d: find the smallest d where the number of s in [1,d] with s(s-1) \u22610 mod d is >10. Then b is d +1.\n\nSo perhaps this substitution makes it easier. Let me think of it this way.\n\nWe need to find the smallest d such that the number of s in 1 to d with s(s-1) \u22610 mod d is greater than 10, then the minimal b is d +1.\n\nTherefore, let's think of the equation s(s-1) \u22610 mod d. So for each d, count the number of s in [1,d] where this holds. \n\nTo analyze this equation s(s-1) \u22610 mod d, note that s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, their product is divisible by d only if the factors of d are distributed between s and s-1. Since s and s-1 are coprime, d must divide the product s(s-1) only if d1 divides s and d2 divides s-1, where d1 and d2 are coprime divisors of d with d1*d2 =d.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s mod d is equal to the number of pairs (d1,d2) such that d1*d2 =d, gcd(d1,d2)=1, and then the number of solutions s \u22610 mod d1 and s \u22611 mod d2.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, for each such pair (d1,d2), there is a unique solution modulo d. Therefore, the total number of solutions s mod d is equal to the number of such pairs (d1,d2).\n\nWait, but actually, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d1 of d such that d1 divides s and d/d1 divides s-1. Since s and s-1 are coprime, d1 and d/d1 must be coprime, so d1 must divide s and d/d1 must divide s-1, and since gcd(d1, d/d1)=1, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to factor d into coprime pairs (d1, d2) where d1*d2=d. Each such factorization corresponds to a unique solution modulo d. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s in [1,d] is exactly equal to the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime positive integers d1 and d2 (with order mattering? Wait, actually, since d1 and d2 are coprime and d1*d2=d, each such pair (d1,d2) is unique up to ordering, but since s \u22610 mod d1 and s\u22611 mod d2, the ordering matters here because switching d1 and d2 would lead to different congruence conditions. However, since d1 and d2 must be coprime and their product is d, each coprime pair (d1,d2) with d1*d2=d and gcd(d1,d2)=1 corresponds to exactly one solution s modulo d. Therefore, the total number of solutions is equal to the number of such coprime ordered pairs (d1,d2). \n\nHowever, since d1 and d2 are coprime and d1*d2 =d, each such pair is determined by a subset of the prime factors of d assigned to d1 and the rest to d2. So the number of such pairs is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. Wait, that might be the case. Let me think:\n\nSuppose d has prime factorization d = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an. Then the number of ways to write d as d1*d2 with gcd(d1,d2)=1 is 2^n, because for each prime factor, you can assign it to d1 or d2, but not both. So each prime has two choices, so total 2^n. However, since d1 and d2 are ordered, so (d1,d2) and (d2,d1) are considered different unless d1=d2=1, but since d \u22651, but in our case, d could be 1, but in our problem d is at least 1 (since b \u22652 implies d =b-1 \u22651). However, when d=1, the equation s(s-1)\u22610 mod 1 is trivial, so all s satisfy it, but since s ranges from 1 to 1, so only one solution. \n\nWait, so in general, for d with n distinct prime factors, the number of coprime ordered pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=d is 2^n. Therefore, the number of solutions s mod d is 2^n. Thus, the number of solutions s in [1,d] is exactly 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. Wait, but let me test this with an example.\n\nTake d=6, which factors into 2*3, so two primes. Then the coprime pairs (d1,d2) are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). Each of these gives a solution s mod 6:\n\nFor (d1=1, d2=6): s \u22610 mod 1 (always true) and s\u22611 mod 6. So s\u22611 mod6.\n\nFor (d1=2, d2=3): s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod3. Solve these:\n\ns \u22610 mod2,\n\ns \u22611 mod3.\n\nPossible solutions: s=4 mod6.\n\nCheck 4 mod2=0, 4 mod3=1. Correct.\n\nFor (d1=3, d2=2): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod2.\n\nSo s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod2.\n\nSolution: s=3 mod6? 3 mod2=1, 3 mod3=0. Yes. So s\u22613 mod6.\n\nWait, but 3 mod2 is 1, so 3 mod2=1? Wait 3 divided by 2 is 1 with remainder 1, so yes. So s=3 mod6.\n\nWait but 3 mod3 is 0, so that works. \n\nFor (d1=6, d2=1): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod1 (always true). So s\u22610 mod6. \n\nTherefore, solutions mod6 are s\u22610,1,3,4 mod6. So in total 4 solutions, which is 2^2=4, since d=6 has 2 distinct primes. \n\nSo that works. Let's check another example. Take d=4, which is 2^2. So number of distinct primes is 1. Then according to the formula, the number of solutions should be 2^1=2. Let's see:\n\nPossible coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=4 and gcd(d1,d2)=1. Since 4 is 2^2, the coprime pairs must have one part 1 and the other 4, or 4 and 1. Because if you split the prime factors, since there is only one prime, you can't split it. So the pairs are (1,4), (4,1). \n\nSo solutions:\n\nFor (1,4): s\u22610 mod1 (any) and s\u22611 mod4. So s\u22611 mod4.\n\nFor (4,1): s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod1 (any). So s\u22610 mod4.\n\nThus, solutions mod4 are s\u22610,1 mod4. So two solutions, which matches 2^1=2.\n\nAnother example, d=12. Prime factors are 2^2*3^1, so two distinct primes. Then number of solutions should be 2^2=4. Wait, but let me check:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\nPossible pairs where d1*d2=12 and gcd(d1,d2)=1. The coprime divisors would be:\n\n1 &12,\n\n3 &4,\n\n4 &3,\n\n12 &1,\n\nWait, but 3 and 4 are coprime. Also, 1 and 12, etc. So total four pairs. Let's see the solutions:\n\nFor (1,12): s\u22610 mod1 and s\u22611 mod12 \u2192 s\u22611 mod12.\n\nFor (3,4): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\nFind s \u22610 mod3 and 1 mod4. Let's see: numbers congruent to 1 mod4: 1,5,9,13,... mod12. 9 mod3=0, so 9 is solution. So s\u22619 mod12.\n\nFor (4,3): s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod3: 1,4,7,10 mod12. Among those, 4 mod4=0, so 4 mod12. 4 mod3=1? 4 mod3 is 1, yes. So s\u22614 mod12.\n\nFor (12,1): s\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod1. So s\u22610 mod12.\n\nThus, solutions mod12 are s\u22610,1,4,9 mod12. So four solutions, which is 2^2=4. That works.\n\nTherefore, the formula holds: the number of solutions s in [1,d] is equal to 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. \n\nWait, but hold on, in the case of d=6, which has two distinct primes, we had four solutions, which is 2^2. For d=4 (one prime), two solutions. For d=12 (two primes), four solutions. \n\nWait, but let me test with d= p^a, a prime power. Let's take d=9 (3^2). Then the number of distinct primes is 1, so solutions should be 2^1=2.\n\nIndeed, coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=9 and gcd(d1,d2)=1:\n\n(1,9) and (9,1). So two solutions.\n\nFor (1,9): s\u22611 mod9,\n\nFor (9,1): s\u22610 mod9,\n\nThus, two solutions. Correct.\n\nAnother example: d=30, which factors into 2*3*5 (three primes). Then the number of solutions should be 2^3=8. Let's see if that's the case.\n\nCoprime pairs (d1,d2) with product 30:\n\nThe coprime divisors must be pairs where one gets some subset of the prime factors, and the other gets the rest. So each prime can go to d1 or d2, so 2^3=8 pairs. Each of these will correspond to a solution. So indeed, there are 8 solutions mod30. \n\nThus, the formula holds. Therefore, the number of solutions s in [1,d] is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.\n\nTherefore, the number of b-eautiful numbers for base b is equal to 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of (b-1). Therefore, we need to find the smallest b where 2^{k} >10. Since 2^4=16>10, so we need k \u22654. Because 2^3=8 <10, so the minimal k where 2^k exceeds 10 is k=4. Therefore, the minimal b is the minimal integer such that b-1 has at least four distinct prime factors.\n\nWait, hold on, but is that correct? Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the number of solutions is 2^{number of distinct prime factors of d}. So, if d has k distinct primes, then the number of solutions is 2^k. Therefore, to have more than 10 solutions, we need 2^k >10. The smallest k where 2^k >10 is k=4 (since 2^4=16). Therefore, d must have at least four distinct prime factors. Hence, the minimal d is the smallest number with four distinct prime factors. The minimal such d is 2*3*5*7=210. Therefore, the minimal b would be 210 +1=211? But wait, maybe there's a smaller d with more exponents?\n\nWait, but the number of distinct prime factors is what matters. The minimal number with four distinct prime factors is indeed 2*3*5*7=210. Therefore, the minimal b would be 211. But wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"more than ten b-eautiful integers\", so 11 or more. 2^4=16 is more than 10, so that works. But maybe there is a number d with three prime factors but with an exponent such that the number of solutions is higher?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the formula says that the number of solutions is 2^{number of distinct prime factors}. So even if d has a prime raised to a higher power, the number of distinct prime factors is what counts. For example, d=8=2^3, which has one distinct prime factor, so number of solutions is 2^1=2. So even if the prime is raised to a higher power, the count is still 2^1. Therefore, the exponent doesn't matter. Only the number of distinct primes. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d with four distinct prime factors is 2*3*5*7=210, so the minimal b is 211. But wait, is that correct? Let me check if there is a d with three distinct primes but with the number of solutions higher than 10? Wait, 2^3=8 <10, so no. So the first time we get over 10 is when k=4, so d must have four distinct primes. So 210 is the minimal such d. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me verify with an example. Take d=210 (2*3*5*7). Then the number of solutions is 2^4=16, so the number of b-eautiful numbers would be 16. That's over 10. So b=211 would be the minimal such base? \n\nBut wait, maybe there is a smaller d which has four prime factors but with some exponents? Wait, but 2*3*5*7 is the minimal number with four distinct primes. Any other number with four primes would be larger. So 210 is indeed the minimal d with four distinct primes. So then, the minimal b is 211. But the problem says \"Find the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\" \n\nBut wait, hold on, hold on. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my logic here. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the formula says that the number of solutions s in [1,d] is equal to 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. Therefore, if d has k distinct primes, then the number of solutions is 2^k. So to get more than 10, we need 2^k >10. The minimal k is 4, so minimal d with k=4 is 210, so minimal b is 211.\n\nBut let me check with d=60. Let me see, d=60 has prime factors 2,3,5, so three primes. Therefore, number of solutions is 8. Which is less than 10. \n\nWait, but maybe there are some numbers with three prime factors but with more solutions? For example, if the number has three prime factors but with exponents, like 12=2^2*3, which has two distinct primes, so solutions are 4. \n\nWait, but even if a number has three distinct prime factors, like 30=2*3*5, the number of solutions is 8, which is still less than 10. \n\nWait, so the next number after 30 with four prime factors is 2*3*5*7=210. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut before I accept that, let me check if there is a case where the number of solutions could be more than 2^k. For example, if d is 1. Then d=1 has zero prime factors, so 2^0=1. Which is correct, since s can only be 1. \n\nWait, but what about d=1, which would correspond to b=2. The number of solutions would be 1, which is 2^0=1. Correct. \n\nWait, another case: d= p^a*q^b, with two primes. The number of solutions is 4, as in d=6. \n\nTherefore, the formula holds. \n\nWait, but hold on. Wait a second. Let me check with d=16, which is 2^4. Then the number of solutions is 2^1=2. Let me see:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=16 and gcd(d1,d2)=1. Since 16 is 2^4, the coprime divisors must be 1 and 16. So two pairs: (1,16) and (16,1). So solutions s\u22611 mod16 and s\u22610 mod16. So two solutions. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the formula holds. \n\nTherefore, the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d where 2^{number of distinct prime factors of d} exceeds 10 is when the number of prime factors is 4, so the minimal such d is 2*3*5*7=210. Therefore, the minimal b is 211. \n\nHowever, before finalizing this answer, let me check if there's a case where d has a repeated prime factor but somehow the number of solutions is higher. For example, suppose d is a square of a prime, but no, then it still has only one distinct prime factor, so the solutions would still be 2. \n\nAlternatively, if d is 1, which gives 1 solution, etc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is slightly different? Wait, the formula counts the number of coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=d, and each such pair gives a unique solution. The number of such pairs is indeed 2^k where k is the number of distinct primes, since each prime can go to d1 or d2. \n\nTherefore, the formula is correct. Therefore, the minimal d is 210, so the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut wait, let me check with d=2*3*5*7=210. The number of solutions is 16. \n\nWait, but let's see, maybe the problem counts numbers where s can be equal to 0? Wait, no, because s is the square root of n, and n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must be at least b (since the first digit is at least 1, so the number is at least 1*b +0 =b). Therefore, n >=b, so s = sqrt(n) >= sqrt(b). Since b = d+1, so sqrt(d+1). \n\nWait, but the formula counts s from 1 to d. But in reality, s must satisfy s^2 >= b (since n is two-digit in base b, so n >=b). So s^2 >=b =d+1. Therefore, s must be at least ceil(sqrt(d+1)). \n\nTherefore, perhaps the actual number of solutions is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod d. However, according to our previous analysis, the number of solutions in [1,d] is 2^k, but some of these solutions may have s < sqrt(d+1). So the actual count might be less. Therefore, my previous conclusion may be incorrect because it didn't consider that some solutions s might be too small (i.e., s^2 < b). \n\nOh no! That's a crucial point I missed. The problem states that n must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b and b\u00b2 -1. Therefore, the square root s = sqrt(n) must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s < sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) \u2248 b. But specifically, s must satisfy s^2 \u2265 b and s^2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1. So s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is slightly less than b, so floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)) = b-1. Therefore, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nTherefore, in terms of d = b -1, so b = d +1, then s must be in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d].\n\nTherefore, the number of valid s is the number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod d. \n\nTherefore, even though the total number of solutions in [1,d] is 2^k, some of them may lie below ceil(sqrt(d+1)), and thus not contribute to the count of b-eautiful numbers. \n\nTherefore, my previous conclusion was incorrect because it didn't take into account that some solutions s may be too small (i.e., s^2 < b). \n\nTherefore, we need to adjust the count to exclude those s which are too small. \n\nThis complicates things. Let me try to re-express the problem with this in mind.\n\nGiven that, for each d (where b =d+1), the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod d. \n\nSo the total solutions are 2^k, but we need to subtract those solutions s which are less than ceil(sqrt(d+1)). \n\nTherefore, the problem now becomes: find the smallest d such that the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] with s(s-1) \u22610 mod d is greater than 10. \n\nTherefore, the previous approach was incomplete. Let's see how this affects the result. \n\nLet me take the previous example where d=210 (b=211). Then sqrt(d+1)=sqrt(211)\u224814.52, so ceil(sqrt(d+1))=15. So s must be between 15 and 210. \n\nThe total solutions in [1,210] are 16 (since 210 has four distinct prime factors). But how many of these 16 solutions are \u226515?\n\nWe need to check how many of the 16 solutions s in [1,210] satisfy s\u226515. \n\nBut this requires knowing the actual solutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in some cases, even with four prime factors, the number of valid s is still not enough? Hmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is smaller than 210? Let's think. \n\nWait, let's try to see for smaller d. Let me pick d=60 (so b=61). \n\nd=60 has three distinct prime factors (2,3,5). So the total number of solutions is 8. \n\nNow, sqrt(d+1)=sqrt(61)\u22487.81, so ceil(sqrt(61))=8. So s must be between 8 and 60. \n\nTherefore, we need to count the number of solutions between 8 and 60. \n\nTotal solutions in [1,60] are 8. So how many of them are \u22658? \n\nWe can compute the solutions s for d=60:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=60 and gcd(d1,d2)=1. The distinct prime factors are 2,3,5. So the number of coprime pairs is 2^3=8. Let's list them:\n\nThe prime factors are 2,3,5. Each can go to d1 or d2. \n\nThe possible coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,60), (2,30), (3,20), (4,15), (5,12), (6,10), (10,6), (12,5), (15,4), (20,3), (30,2), (60,1). Wait, but actually, each pair is determined by the assignment of primes. Let me think better:\n\nEach prime can be assigned to d1 or d2. Since 60 factors into 2^2*3*5, the coprime pairs must have d1 and d2 such that all the primes are in one or the other. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\n- Assign all primes to d1: d1=60, d2=1\n\n- Assign all primes to d2: d1=1, d2=60\n\n- Assign 2 to d1, 3 and 5 to d2: d1=4 (since 2^2), d2=15 (3*5)\n\nWait no, actually, since d1 must be a divisor of 60, and d2 must be 60/d1, and coprime. Let me list all coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\nPossible coprime divisors:\n\n1 and 60,\n\n3 and 20 (since 3 and 20 are coprime),\n\n4 and 15 (4 is 2^2, 15 is 3*5; coprime),\n\n5 and 12 (5 and 12 are coprime),\n\nAlso:\n\n20 and 3,\n\n15 and 4,\n\n12 and 5,\n\nAnd 60 and1,\n\nWait, but also:\n\nWait, 6 and 10? 6 and 10 have a common factor 2, so no. 10 and 6 are not coprime. \n\nSimilarly, 2 and 30? 2 and 30 have common factor 2. \n\nSo the coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,60),\n\n(3,20),\n\n(4,15),\n\n(5,12),\n\n(20,3),\n\n(15,4),\n\n(12,5),\n\n(60,1)\n\nTotal 8 pairs. \n\nNow for each of these pairs, we can find the solution s mod60:\n\nFor (d1=1, d2=60): s\u22610 mod1 and s\u22611 mod60 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=3, d2=20): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod20. Let's solve:\n\nFind s \u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod20.\n\nLet s=20k+1. Then 20k+1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d220k \u2261-1 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k \u2261-1 mod3 \u21d22k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3. So k=3m+1. Thus s=20*(3m+1)+1=60m+21. So solutions mod60 are s\u226121 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=4, d2=15): s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\nLet s=15k+1. Then 15k+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4. Thus k=4m+1, so s=15*(4m+1)+1=60m+16. So s\u226116 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=5, d2=12): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod12.\n\nLet s=12k+1. Then 12k+1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d212k \u2261-1 mod5 \u21d212\u22612 mod5 \u21d22k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d22k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k\u22612 mod5. Thus, k=5m+2 \u21d2 s=12*(5m+2)+1=60m+25. So s\u226125 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=20, d2=3): s\u22610 mod20 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=20k. Then 20k\u22611 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=20*(3m+2)=60m+40. So s\u226140 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=15, d2=4): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\ns=15k. 15k \u22611 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k=4m+3 \u21d2s=15*(4m+3)=60m+45. So s\u226145 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=12, d2=5): s\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns=12k. 12k\u22611 mod5 \u21d212\u22612 mod5 \u21d22k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22613 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+3 \u21d2s=12*(5m+3)=60m+36. So s\u226136 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=60, d2=1): s\u22610 mod60 and s\u22611 mod1 \u21d2s\u22610 mod60.\n\nThus, the solutions mod60 are:\n\n1, 16, 21, 25, 36, 40, 45, 60 mod60.\n\nTherefore, in the range s from 1 to60, the solutions are s=1,16,21,25,36,40,45,60. \n\nNow, the valid s must be between ceil(sqrt(61))=8 and 60. So exclude s=1. The valid solutions are 16,21,25,36,40,45,60. That's 7 numbers. \n\nTherefore, for d=60 (b=61), there are 7 b-eautiful numbers, which is less than 10. \n\nSo even with three prime factors, which gives 8 solutions, only 7 are valid because one is too small. \n\nNow, let's try d=105 (so b=106). Let me see:\n\nd=105 factors into 3*5*7. So three distinct primes. So the number of solutions is 8. \n\nsqrt(106)\u224810.29, so ceil is 11. \n\nSo s must be between 11 and 105. \n\nThe solutions would be similar to above. Let me see:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\nPrime factors 3,5,7. \n\nPossible coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\n(1,105), (3,35), (5,21), (7,15), (35,3), (21,5), (15,7), (105,1). \n\nThus, eight pairs. \n\nEach gives a solution s mod105. \n\nLet me compute them:\n\nFor (1,105): s\u22611 mod105.\n\nFor (3,35): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod35.\n\nSolve s=35k +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d235k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d235\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d22k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2s=35*(3m+1)+1=105m+36. So s\u226136 mod105.\n\nFor (5,21): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod21.\n\ns=21k +1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d221k \u2261-1 mod5 \u21d221\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+4 \u21d2s=21*(5m+4)+1=105m+85. So s\u226185 mod105.\n\nFor (7,15): s\u22610 mod7 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns=15k +1 \u22610 mod7 \u21d215k \u2261-1 mod7 \u21d215\u22611 mod7 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod7 \u21d2k=7m+6 \u21d2s=15*(7m+6)+1=105m+91. So s\u226191 mod105.\n\nFor (35,3): s\u22610 mod35 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=35k \u22611 mod3 \u21d235\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=35*(3m+2)=105m+70. So s\u226170 mod105.\n\nFor (21,5): s\u22610 mod21 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns=21k \u22611 mod5 \u21d221\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+1 \u21d2s=21*(5m+1)=105m+21. So s\u226121 mod105.\n\nFor (15,7): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod7.\n\ns=15k \u22611 mod7 \u21d215\u22611 mod7 \u21d2k\u22611 mod7 \u21d2k=7m+1 \u21d2s=15*(7m+1)=105m+15. So s\u226115 mod105.\n\nFor (105,1): s\u22610 mod105.\n\nThus, solutions mod105 are: 1,15,21,36,70,85,91,105. \n\nThe valid s must be between 11 and 105. Excluding s=1, the valid ones are 15,21,36,70,85,91,105. That's 7 solutions again. \n\nSame as before. \n\nHmm. Let's try d=120. Let me see. \n\nd=120 factors into 2^3*3*5. So three distinct primes. Thus, number of solutions is 8. \n\nsqrt(121)=11, so s must be from 11 to 120.\n\nLet me compute solutions for d=120.\n\nPrime factors are 2,3,5. The coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\nEach prime can go to d1 or d2. \n\nPossible coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\n(1,120),\n\n(3,40), (since 3 and 40 are coprime),\n\n(5,24),\n\n(8,15),\n\n(40,3),\n\n(24,5),\n\n(15,8),\n\n(120,1).\n\nWait, let me do this systematically. \n\nPrime factors are 2,3,5. Assign each to d1 or d2.\n\nPossible assignments:\n\n- All primes to d1: d1=120, d2=1\n\n- All primes to d2: d1=1, d2=120\n\n- Assign 2 to d1, 3 and5 to d2: d1=8 (since 2^3), d2= 15 (3*5)\n\nWait, no. Wait, d1 must be a divisor of 120. Let me think in terms of coprime pairs. \n\nAlternatively, since d=120=2^3*3*5. \n\nCoprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\nEach prime factor must be entirely in d1 or d2. \n\nSo possible coprime pairs:\n\n- d1=1, d2=120,\n\n- d1=3, d2=40 (since 3 is assigned to d1, and 2^3*5 to d2),\n\n- d1=5, d2=24 (5 assigned to d1, 2^3*3 to d2),\n\n- d1=15, d2=8 (3*5 in d1, 2^3 in d2),\n\n- d1=8, d2=15,\n\n- d1=24, d2=5,\n\n- d1=40, d2=3,\n\n- d1=120, d2=1.\n\nSo eight pairs. \n\nNow compute each solution:\n\n(1,120): s\u22611 mod120.\n\n(3,40): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod40.\n\nLet s=40k +1. Then 40k+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d240k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d240\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=40*(3m+2)+1=120m+81. So s\u226181 mod120.\n\n(5,24): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod24.\n\ns=24k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d224k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d224\u22614 mod5 \u21d24k\u2261-1 \u21d24k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+1 \u21d2s=24*(5m+1)+1=120m+25. So s\u226125 mod120.\n\n(15,8): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod8.\n\ns=8k +1\u22610 mod15 \u21d28k\u2261-1 mod15 \u21d28k\u226114 mod15 \u21d2Multiply both sides by inverse of 8 mod15. 8*2=16\u22611 mod15 \u21d2 inverse is 2. Thus, k\u226114*2=28\u226113 mod15 \u21d2k=15m+13 \u21d2s=8*(15m+13)+1=120m+105. So s\u2261105 mod120.\n\n(8,15): s\u22610 mod8 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns=15k +1\u22610 mod8 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod8 \u21d215\u22617 mod8 \u21d27k\u2261-1 mod8 \u21d27k\u22617 mod8 \u21d2k\u22611 mod8 \u21d2k=8m+1 \u21d2s=15*(8m+1)+1=120m+16. So s\u226116 mod120.\n\n(24,5): s\u22610 mod24 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns=24k\u22611 mod5 \u21d224\u22614 mod5 \u21d24k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+4 \u21d2s=24*(5m+4)=120m+96. So s\u226196 mod120.\n\n(40,3): s\u22610 mod40 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=40k\u22611 mod3 \u21d240\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2s=40*(3m+1)=120m+40. So s\u226140 mod120.\n\n(120,1): s\u22610 mod120.\n\nThus, the solutions mod120 are:\n\n1,16,25,40,81,96,105,120 mod120.\n\nNow, valid s must be between 11 and 120. So exclude s=1. The valid solutions are 16,25,40,81,96,105,120. That's 7 again. \n\nHmm, so even with three primes, we still get 7 solutions. So even with three primes, it's still 7. \n\nWait, maybe trying d=210 (b=211). Let's see:\n\nd=210 factors into 2*3*5*7. So four distinct primes. Number of solutions is 16. \n\nsqrt(d+1)=sqrt(211)\u224814.52, so ceil is 15. \n\nWe need to find solutions between 15 and 210. \n\nThe solutions are 16 in total. Let me see how many of them are \u226515. \n\nAssuming all solutions except s=1 are above 15? Let me think. The solutions mod210 would be various numbers, but likely most are above 15. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal s is 1, then others are spread out. Let me try to find a few solutions:\n\nTake the coprime pairs for d=210:\n\nPrime factors are 2,3,5,7. Each prime can be assigned to d1 or d2. \n\nLet me pick a few coprime pairs and compute their solutions:\n\nFirst, (1,210): s\u22611 mod210. So s=1,211,... but in 1 to210, s=1 and 211 is beyond. So only s=1.\n\nSecond, (2,105): s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod105.\n\ns=105k+1\u22610 mod2 \u21d2105k is odd, so 105 is odd \u21d2k must be odd \u21d2k=2m+1 \u21d2s=105*(2m+1)+1=210m +106. So mod210, s\u2261106 mod210.\n\nThird, (3,70): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod70.\n\ns=70k +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d270k \u2261-1 mod3 \u21d270\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=70*(3m+2)+1=210m+141. So s\u2261141 mod210.\n\nFourth, (5,42): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod42.\n\ns=42k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d242k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d242\u22612 mod5 \u21d22k\u2261-1 \u21d22k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k\u22612 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+2 \u21d2s=42*(5m+2)+1=210m+85. So s\u226185 mod210.\n\nFifth, (6,35): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod35.\n\nWait, wait, let me pick another pair. Maybe (7,30):\n\ns\u22610 mod7 and s\u22611 mod30.\n\ns=30k+1\u22610 mod7 \u21d230k\u2261-1 mod7 \u21d230\u22612 mod7 \u21d22k\u2261-1 \u21d22k\u22616 mod7 \u21d2k\u22613 mod7 \u21d2k=7m+3 \u21d2s=30*(7m+3)+1=210m+91. So s\u226191 mod210.\n\nContinuing, but this is tedious. Let me instead note that the minimal solutions (other than 1) will be at least 16, but perhaps not. Wait, for example, the solution for (2,105) gives s=106 mod210, so 106 is above 15. The solution for (3,70) gives 141, which is also above 15. The solution for (5,42) gives 85 mod210, which is 85, also above 15. The solution for (7,30) gives 91. \n\nAnother solution pair: (15,14):\n\nWait, let me think of another coprime pair. For example, (14,15):\n\nWait, d1=14 and d2=15. Since 14=2*7 and 15=3*5, they are coprime. So:\n\ns\u22610 mod14 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns=14k \u22611 mod15 \u21d214k\u22611 mod15 \u21d214\u2261-1 mod15 \u21d2-k\u22611 mod15 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod15 \u21d2k=15m-1. \n\nThus, s=14*(15m -1)=210m -14. But since we're mod210, this is equivalent to s\u2261-14 mod210 \u21d2 s\u2261196 mod210.\n\nThus, s=196 mod210.\n\nSimilarly, another pair: (10,21):\n\nd1=10 (2*5), d2=21 (3*7). \n\ns\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod21.\n\ns=21k +1\u22610 mod10 \u21d221k\u2261-1 mod10 \u21d221\u22611 mod10 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod10 \u21d2k=10m-1 \u21d2s=21*(10m-1)+1=210m -20. So mod210, s\u2261-20 mod210 \u21d2190 mod210.\n\nSo s=190 mod210.\n\nContinuing this, it seems all solutions except s=1 are above 15. Therefore, in total, there are 16 solutions mod210, one of which is s=1, so 15 solutions between 15 and 210. \n\nWait, 16 total solutions minus 1 (s=1) gives 15 solutions. Since 15 is still less than 10? Wait, no, 15 is greater than 10. Wait, 15 is more than 10. Therefore, for d=210 (b=211), there are 15 b-eautiful numbers, which is more than ten. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check again. If there are 16 total solutions in [1,210], with s=1 being the only one below 15, then the remaining 15 are valid. Therefore, 15 is more than ten. So b=211 would be a candidate. \n\nBut maybe there is a smaller d where the number of solutions minus those too small is more than ten?\n\nLet's see. Let me try d= 2*3*5*7=210 is the first with four primes. But let me check another d with four distinct primes but smaller? Wait, no. 2*3*5*7=210 is the smallest number with four distinct primes. \n\nWait, but what about d=105 (3*5*7) which has three primes, but maybe with some exponent?\n\nWait, no. Let me think of numbers with four prime factors but not necessarily distinct. But the formula counts the number of distinct primes. So even if a number has four prime factors but some are repeated, like 2*2*3*5, which is 60, which has three distinct primes. So no. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d with four distinct primes is indeed 210. \n\nBut let me check another number with four distinct primes but smaller? 2*3*5*7=210 is the minimal. \n\nTherefore, the minimal b is 211. \n\nHowever, perhaps there is a number d with three distinct primes but the number of solutions minus the small ones is more than 10?\n\nWait, let's see, suppose d=2^4*3*5*7, but that's larger. \n\nWait, let me think of d= 2*3*5*7=210 is the minimal. So then the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut let me check another d with four primes but arranged differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a d with three distinct primes but with some solutions just above sqrt(d+1), so the total solutions minus the ones below threshold is more than 10?\n\nWait, let's try d= 210, which gives 15 solutions, which is over 10. \n\nWait, but before that, let me see for d= 105 (three primes, three primes gives 8 total solutions, but only 7 valid). \n\nWait, maybe if the number has four prime factors, but one of them is 1? No, primes are at least 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe d= 2*3*5*7=210 is indeed minimal. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of d= 2*3*5*11= 330, which would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, let me check d= 210's predecessor with three primes: 2*3*5*7 is 210. \n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut the problem says \"Find the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\"\n\nHowever, let me think if there's a case where the number of solutions is higher even with three prime factors. For example, suppose d has a prime factor with exponent which allows more solutions? Wait, but no, the number of solutions is based on the number of distinct primes. \n\nWait, let me think of d= 16. Wait, 16 is 2^4, so one distinct prime. The number of solutions is 2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps d= 12. Let's see:\n\nd=12 (2^2*3). Two distinct primes. So total solutions are 4. sqrt(13)=3.605, so ceil is 4. So solutions between 4 and12. The solutions are:\n\nFor d=12, the coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,12), (3,4), (4,3), (12,1).\n\nThe solutions mod12 are 1, 4, 9, 0 mod12. \n\nWait, let me compute them properly:\n\n(1,12): s\u22611 mod12.\n\n(3,4): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\nSolve s=4k+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d24k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=4*(3m+2)+1=12m+9 \u21d2s\u22619 mod12.\n\n(4,3): s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=3k+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d23k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d2k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k=4m+3 \u21d2s=3*(4m+3)+1=12m+10 \u21d2s\u226110 mod12? Wait, let me recheck:\n\nWait, solving s \u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nLet s=4k. Then 4k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2s=4*(3m+1)=12m+4 \u21d2s\u22614 mod12.\n\nWait, so s=4 mod12.\n\nWait, that contradicts my previous thought. Let me redo:\n\nFor (4,3): s \u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nLet s=4k. Then 4k \u22611 mod3 \u21d24k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 (since 4\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3). So k=3m+1 \u21d2s=4*(3m+1)=12m+4 \u21d2s\u22614 mod12.\n\nSimilarly, for (12,1): s\u22610 mod12.\n\nThus, solutions mod12 are 1,4,9,0 (but 0 mod12 is s=12). So the solutions in [1,12] are 1,4,9,12.\n\nNow, valid s must be \u2265ceil(sqrt(13))=4. So the valid solutions are 4,9,12. That's 3 solutions. \n\nHmm, so with two primes, we get 3 solutions. \n\nSo the formula seems to hold. \n\nTherefore, returning to the problem, the minimal d where the number of valid solutions exceeds 10 is when the total solutions minus those below the threshold is over 10. Since for four distinct primes, total solutions are 16, and only s=1 is below the threshold (assuming sqrt(d+1) is above 1), so 16 -1=15 solutions. \n\nWait, sqrt(d+1) when d=210 is sqrt(211)\u224814.5, so ceil is 15. So the threshold is 15. So any solution s less than 15 is invalid. The solutions are 1, and others. \n\nBut in the example above with d=210, the solutions mod210 include s=1 and others like 106,141,85,91, etc. So s=1 is the only one below 15. So total valid solutions are 15. Which is more than ten. \n\nTherefore, b=211 is the minimal base. \n\nWait, but let me check for d=105 (three primes), but if there's another d with three primes where the number of valid solutions is over ten? \n\nWait, for example, take d= 2*3*5*7=210 (four primes) gives 15 solutions. \n\nWhat about d= 2*3*5*11= 330 (four primes). But that's bigger. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a d with four prime factors but smaller than 210? \n\nWait, 2*3*5*7 is 210. The next smallest would be replacing 7 with a smaller prime, but 2,3,5,7 are the first four primes. \n\nThus, 210 is indeed the minimal d with four distinct primes. \n\nTherefore, the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe there is a case where d has four prime factors, but one of them is repeated? Like 2*2*3*5. But then the number of distinct primes is three, so still gives 8 solutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal d with four prime factors is indeed 210, so the answer is 211. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong and the formula counts all solutions even below the threshold, but the problem counts only those with two digits, so maybe there's a different approach. \n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Let's suppose that for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 such that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). \n\nTo find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps there's a better way than my previous approach. Let me try to compute for some values of b and see. \n\nLet me try b= 240 (d=239). Wait, but 239 is a prime, so the number of solutions would be 2, which is too small. \n\nAlternatively, take b= 120 (d=119). 119=7*17, two primes. So solutions count is 4. \n\nHmm, not enough. \n\nAlternatively, take b= 210 (d=209). Wait, 209 is 11*19, two primes. So solutions count is 4. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, b= 211 (d=210). As before, 210 has four primes, so solutions count is 16, minus 1 gives 15. \n\nTherefore, 15>10. \n\nAlternatively, let me check for b= 120 (d=119). \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the number of solutions. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the formula says that the number of solutions is 2^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. So for d=210, which has four primes, it's 16. \n\nSo if I can find a d with four prime factors smaller than 210, then that would be better, but I don't think such a d exists. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d is indeed 210, leading to b=211. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 211. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"Find the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\" \n\nWait, but maybe there's a number with three distinct primes where the number of valid solutions is more than 10? For instance, let's see for d= 2520 (which is 2^3*3^2*5*7). It has four distinct primes, so solutions would be 16. But that's larger. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a number with three primes where the number of valid solutions is more than 10. Let me see:\n\nSuppose d has three distinct primes, so total solutions are 8. But to get more than 10, need at least 11 solutions. 8 is not enough. \n\nWait, unless there are multiple solutions in the valid range. Let me see for d= 210 (four primes) gives 15 solutions. \n\nWait, perhaps there is a d with five distinct primes? But the minimal such d would be 2*3*5*7*11=2310, which is way larger than 210. \n\nTherefore, it seems that 211 is the minimal b. \n\nWait, but let me think of another angle. Maybe the formula counts each solution mod d, but in the range [1,d], so the total solutions are indeed 2^k. But the valid solutions are those s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d]. So the count is 2^k minus the number of solutions below ceil(sqrt(d+1)). \n\nTherefore, if we can find a d where 2^k minus the number of solutions below the threshold exceeds 10. \n\nSuppose d= 210, then k=4, so 16 solutions. How many of them are below ceil(sqrt(211))=15? \n\nOnly s=1. So 16-1=15>10. \n\nIf we take a d with k=4, but with more solutions below the threshold, maybe it's possible to have a smaller d. \n\nWait, but the minimal d with four primes is 210. Let me think if there is a d with four primes but with a higher sqrt(d+1), so that more solutions are below the threshold. \n\nWait, but sqrt(d+1) increases as d increases, so the threshold would be higher. Therefore, with a smaller d, the threshold is lower, so fewer solutions are excluded. \n\nWait, for example, take d= 2*3*5*7=210, which is minimal. \n\nSuppose there's a smaller d with four primes, but that's impossible. \n\nTherefore, 211 is indeed the minimal base. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 211. \n\nBut wait, I have a feeling that maybe the problem expects a smaller answer. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that all solutions except s=1 are valid. Let me check with d= 210:\n\nIf d=210, then the solutions are s=1 and other solutions like 106, etc., but perhaps there are more solutions below 15?\n\nWait, let me think of a solution pair like (2,105). The solution s=106 mod210 is 106, which is above 15. \n\nAnother solution pair (3,70): solution is 141 mod210, which is 141. \n\nAnother solution pair (5,42): s=85 mod210, which is 85. \n\n(7,30): 91 mod210. \n\n(6,35): s= ?\n\nWait, let me take another coprime pair (6,35). \n\nWait, d1=6 and d2=35. \n\nWait, 6 and 35 are coprime (6=2*3, 35=5*7). So:\n\ns\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod35.\n\ns=35k+1 \u22610 mod6 \u21d235k\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d235\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d2-k\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d2k\u22611 mod6 \u21d2k=6m+1 \u21d2s=35*(6m+1)+1=210m+36. \n\nThus, s\u226136 mod210. \n\nSo s=36 mod210. 36 is above 15. \n\nAnother pair: (10,21): \n\nd1=10 and d2=21 (coprime). \n\ns\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod21.\n\nSolutions like 190 mod210. \n\nAnother pair: (14,15): \n\ns\u22610 mod14 and s\u22611 mod15 \u21d2196 mod210. \n\nAnother pair: (15,14):\n\ns\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod14 \u21d2?\n\nWait, let me pick another pair (5,42):\n\ns=85 mod210. \n\n(21,10):\n\ns\u22610 mod21 and s\u22611 mod10. \n\ns=10k+1\u22610 mod21 \u21d210k\u2261-1 mod21 \u21d210k\u226120 mod21 \u21d2k\u22612 mod21/ gcd(10,21)=1 \u21d2k=21m+2 \u21d2s=10*(21m+2)+1=210m+21. So s\u226121 mod210. 21 is above 15. \n\nSimilarly, (35,6):\n\ns\u22610 mod35 and s\u22611 mod6.\n\ns=35k\u22611 mod6 \u21d235\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d2-k\u22611 mod6 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d2k=6m-1 \u21d2s=35*(6m-1)=210m -35 \u21d2 mod210 is 175 mod210. \n\nSo 175 is above 15. \n\nAnother pair (70,3):\n\ns\u22610 mod70 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=70k\u22611 mod3 \u21d270\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2s=70*(3m+1)=210m+70 \u21d270 mod210. \n\n70 is above 15. \n\nSimilarly, (42,5):\n\ns\u22610 mod42 and s\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 solution like 85 mod210? \n\nWait, anyway, all the solutions except s=1 are above 15. \n\nTherefore, total valid solutions are 15, which is over ten. \n\nTherefore, b=211 is indeed the minimal base. \n\nHowever, I recall that in the problem's example, 81 is 13-eautiful. Let me check for base 13:\n\nd=12 (b=13). d=12 has two distinct primes (2 and 3), so number of solutions is 4. \n\nThe valid s must be between ceil(sqrt(13))=4 and 12. \n\nThe solutions mod12 are 1,4,9,12. \n\nValid solutions are 4,9,12. So three numbers. \n\nIndeed, 81 is one of them (s=9, so n=81). The other two would be:\n\nFor s=4: n=16. In base13, 16 is 13+3, so digits 1 and3. Sum is 1+3=4, which is sqrt(16). \n\nSimilarly, s=12: n=144. In base13, 144 divided by13 is 11*13=143, so 11*13 +1=144? No, 11*13 is 143, so 144 is 11*13 +1 \u2192 digits 11 and 1. Their sum is 12, which is sqrt(144). So yes, those are valid. \n\nTherefore, three numbers, which matches the count. \n\nTherefore, the formula holds. \n\nThus, my conclusion is that the minimal b is 211. \n\nHowever, I wonder if there's a mistake in assuming that all solutions except s=1 are valid. Let me check another example. Let's take d=30 (b=31). \n\nd=30 has three primes (2,3,5). So solutions count is 8. \n\nsqrt(31)=5.56, so ceil is6. \n\nSolutions mod30 are 1, 6, 10, 16, 21, 25, 26, 30. \n\nWait, let me compute them:\n\nThe coprime pairs for d=30 (2*3*5):\n\n(1,30), (2,15), (3,10), (5,6), (15,2), (10,3), (6,5), (30,1).\n\nSolutions mod30:\n\n(1,30): s\u22611 mod30.\n\n(2,15): s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns=15k+1\u22610 mod2 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod2 \u21d215 is odd \u21d2k must be odd \u21d2k=2m+1 \u21d2s=15*(2m+1)+1=30m+16 \u21d2s\u226116 mod30.\n\n(3,10): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod10.\n\ns=10k+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d210k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d210\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=10*(3m+2)+1=30m+21 \u21d2s\u226121 mod30.\n\n(5,6): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod6.\n\ns=6k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d26k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d26\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+4 \u21d2s=6*(5m+4)+1=30m+25 \u21d2s\u226125 mod30.\n\n(15,2): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod2.\n\ns=15k\u22611 mod2 \u21d215k\u22611 mod2 \u21d2k\u22611 mod2 \u21d2k=2m+1 \u21d2s=15*(2m+1)=30m+15 \u21d2s\u226115 mod30.\n\nWait, but 15 mod30 is 15. \n\nWait, 15 mod2=1, so that's correct. \n\n(10,3): s\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=10k\u22611 mod3 \u21d210k\u22611 mod3 \u21d210\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2s=10*(3m+1)=30m+10 \u21d2s\u226110 mod30.\n\n(6,5): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns=6k\u22611 mod5 \u21d26k\u22611 mod5 \u21d26\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+1 \u21d2s=6*(5m+1)=30m+6 \u21d2s\u22616 mod30.\n\n(30,1): s\u22610 mod30.\n\nTherefore, the solutions mod30 are 1,6,10,15,16,21,25,30 mod30. \n\nThe valid s must be between 6 and30. So exclude s=1. The valid solutions are 6,10,15,16,21,25,30. That's seven solutions. \n\nIndeed, 2^3=8 total solutions, minus one gives seven. \n\nTherefore, for b=31, there are seven b-eautiful numbers. \n\nTherefore, the formula holds. \n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct, and the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut let me check one more case for d= 210. \n\nTake s=106. Then n=106\u00b2=11236. \n\nExpressed in base b=211, since 106 = a*211 + c? Wait no. Wait, in base b, n must be two digits: n= a*b +c. \n\nWait, n= s\u00b2 = (a*b +c). But since s = a +c, so substituting:\n\n(a +c)^2 = a*b +c.\n\nWith b=211, s=106:\n\na +c =106,\n\na*211 +c =106\u00b2=11236.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\na*211 +c - (a +c) =11236 -106\u00b2,\n\na*(211 -1) = 11236 -11236,\n\nWait, wait, 106 squared is exactly (a*211 +c). Let me compute:\n\nWait, let's compute a and c for s=106:\n\nFrom s(s-1)/(b-1)= a. \n\nHere, s=106, b=211, so d=210:\n\na= (106*105)/210 = (106/2)*(105/105) =53* (105/105)=53*1=53? Wait, let me compute:\n\n106*105 = 11130,\n\n11130 divided by 210 is 11130/210 = 53. So a=53. \n\nThen c= s -a =106 -53=53. \n\nThus, the number is 53*211 +53 =53*(211 +1)=53*212= 53*(200+12)=53*200 +53*12=10600 +636=11236. Which is 106\u00b2. \n\nThe digits are a=53 and c=53. Since base 211 allows digits up to 210, so both are valid. \n\nTherefore, that works. \n\nSimilarly, s=85:\n\na=85*84 /210 = (85*84)/(210)= (85*84)/(210)=85*(84/210)=85*(2/5)=34. \n\nThus a=34, c=85-34=51. \n\nThen n=34*211 +51=34*(200+11)+51=34*200 +34*11 +51=6800+374 +51=6800+425=7225. \n\nWhich is 85\u00b2=7225. \n\nDigits 34 and51 are valid since they are less than 211. \n\nTherefore, all these examples work. \n\nTherefore, I think my conclusion is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{211}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. The question is about finding the least integer base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A number n is called b-eautiful if two conditions are met: first, when written in base b, it has exactly two digits. Second, the sum of these two digits equals the square root of n. \n\nLet me start by understanding what exactly a two-digit number in base b means. In any base b, a two-digit number can be written as n = a*b + c, where a and c are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, a must be between 1 and b-1 (since the first digit can't be zero), and c is between 0 and b-1. So both a and c are integers in those ranges.\n\nThe second condition is that the sum of the digits, a + c, should equal the square root of n. So, mathematically, we have:\n\na + c = sqrt(n)\n\nBut since n is equal to a*b + c, substituting that in, we get:\n\na + c = sqrt(a*b + c)\n\nHmm, okay. So we need to solve this equation for integers a and c with the constraints 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1 and 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b-1. \n\nTo make this easier, maybe square both sides to eliminate the square root. Let me try that:\n\n(a + c)^2 = a*b + c\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 = a*b + c\n\nLet me rearrange all terms to one side:\n\na\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 - a*b - c = 0\n\nHmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can rearrange terms differently. Let me see if I can collect like terms. Let's see:\n\na\u00b2 - a*b + 2ac + c\u00b2 - c = 0\n\nHmm, perhaps grouping terms with a:\n\na\u00b2 + a*(2c - b) + (c\u00b2 - c) = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation in terms of a. Maybe solving for a in terms of c and b would be helpful here. Let's write that equation again:\n\na\u00b2 + (2c - b)a + (c\u00b2 - c) = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula for a:\n\na = [-(2c - b) \u00b1 sqrt((2c - b)^2 - 4*1*(c\u00b2 - c))]/2\n\nLet me compute the discriminant D:\n\nD = (2c - b)^2 - 4*(c\u00b2 - c)\n\nExpanding (2c - b)^2:\n\n4c\u00b2 -4b c + b\u00b2 -4c\u00b2 +4c = ?\n\nWait, let me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: (2c - b)^2 = 4c\u00b2 - 4b c + b\u00b2\n\nSecond term: -4*(c\u00b2 - c) = -4c\u00b2 +4c\n\nSo adding those together:\n\n4c\u00b2 -4b c + b\u00b2 -4c\u00b2 +4c = (-4b c +4c) + (4c\u00b2 -4c\u00b2) + b\u00b2\n\nSimplify:\n\n= (-4c(b -1)) + 0 + b\u00b2\n\nSo D = b\u00b2 -4c(b -1)\n\nTherefore, the discriminant simplifies to D = b\u00b2 -4c(b -1)\n\nFor a to be an integer, the discriminant must be a perfect square. Let me note that.\n\nMoreover, since a must be an integer between 1 and b-1, the solutions for a must satisfy that. So perhaps we can approach this by considering possible values of c and see for which b this equation holds?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to approach the problem by expressing n in terms of a and c, and then setting up the equation a + c = sqrt(n) = sqrt(a b + c). Let me see if there's another way to manipulate this equation.\n\nLet me denote s = a + c, so that s = sqrt(n). Then n = s\u00b2. But n is also equal to a*b + c. Therefore, s\u00b2 = a*b + c.\n\nBut since s = a + c, we can substitute c = s - a into the equation:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + (s - a)\n\nSimplify:\n\ns\u00b2 = a*b + s - a\n\nRearranged:\n\ns\u00b2 - s = a*(b -1)\n\nTherefore:\n\na = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nHmm, interesting. So a must be equal to (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1). Since a has to be an integer between 1 and b-1, the numerator (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), and the result must be an integer a in that range. Also, c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nLet me note that s = a + c, so s must be at least 1 (since a is at least 1 and c is non-negative). Also, since n = s\u00b2 must be a two-digit number in base b, the maximum value of n is b\u00b2 -1 (since the largest two-digit number in base b is (b-1)*b + (b-1) = b\u00b2 -1). Therefore, s\u00b2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1, so s \u2264 b -1. Since s is a positive integer, s can range from 1 up to b-1. Wait, but s must also be such that a and c are digits in base b. Let's see:\n\nSince a is between 1 and b-1, and c = s - a must be between 0 and b-1, so:\n\n0 \u2264 s - a \u2264 b -1\n\nBut since a \u22651, s - a \u2264 s -1. So to have c non-negative, s - a \u22650 => a \u2264 s.\n\nAlso, c = s - a must be \u2264 b-1, so s -a \u2264 b-1 => a \u2265 s - (b -1). But since a is at least 1, this gives a lower bound of a \u2265 max(1, s - b +1).\n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting a bit too abstract. Let me think again.\n\nFrom the equation a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), since a must be an integer, (b -1) divides (s\u00b2 - s). Let me denote that (b-1) divides s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, the factors of (b-1) must divide either s or s-1. \n\nTherefore, (b -1) must be a divisor of s(s -1). Since s and s-1 are coprime, the divisor (b-1) must be a product of a divisor of s and a divisor of s-1. \n\nAlternatively, since (b -1) divides s(s-1), then b-1 divides s(s-1). So for each possible s, the possible values of b-1 are the divisors of s(s-1). Therefore, for each s, the possible b's are divisors of s(s-1) plus 1. \n\nBut perhaps the key idea here is that for a given s, the possible bases b are (divisors of s(s-1) +1). But since we need to count the number of b-eautiful numbers for each b, maybe it's better to approach the problem by considering for each base b, how many pairs (a,c) satisfy the conditions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can express s in terms of b and then find the number of possible s values.\n\nWait, let's go back to the equation:\n\na = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1)\n\nSince a must be between 1 and b-1, inclusive, then:\n\n1 \u2264 (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1\n\nMultiply all parts by (b -1):\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nSo s\u00b2 - s must be between (b -1) and (b -1)^2. Let me denote that as:\n\n(b -1) \u2264 s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2\n\nAdditionally, since s must be such that c = s - a is between 0 and b-1, and a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), then substituting a into c:\n\nc = s - (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \n\nHmm, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let me try to approach this step by step with examples.\n\nThe problem states that 81 is 13-eautiful because 81 in base 13 is 63, which sums to 9, and sqrt(81) is 9. Let's verify that:\n\nIn base 13, 6*13 + 3 = 78 +3 =81. The digits sum to 6+3=9, which is sqrt(81). That works.\n\nSo in that case, s =9, and b=13. Let's see how that fits into the equations above.\n\nUsing the equation a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1):\n\na = (81 -9)/(12) = 72/12 =6, which matches the first digit. Then c = s - a =9 -6=3, which is the second digit. So that works.\n\nSo, perhaps for each base b, we can find all possible s (the square roots) such that (s\u00b2 - s) is divisible by (b-1), and then check that a and c are within the required digit ranges.\n\nTherefore, for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s such that:\n\n1. s\u00b2 = n is a two-digit number in base b, so s\u00b2 < b\u00b2 (since the maximum two-digit number in base b is b\u00b2 -1). Therefore, s must be less than b. Since s is sqrt(n) and n is two-digit, s can be from 1 up to b-1.\n\n2. (s\u00b2 - s) must be divisible by (b -1), so (b -1) divides s(s -1).\n\n3. The resulting a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) must satisfy 1 \u2264 a \u2264 b-1, and c = s - a must satisfy 0 \u2264 c \u2264 b -1.\n\nSo, given that, perhaps for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s between 1 and b-1 such that:\n\n- (b -1) divides s(s -1), and\n\n- a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) is between 1 and b-1,\n\nand then also check that c = s - a is between 0 and b-1. But since a is (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), and c = s - a, perhaps the constraints on c are automatically satisfied?\n\nWait, let me see:\n\nGiven that a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), and c = s - a,\n\nthen c = s - (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) = [s(b -1) - s\u00b2 + s]/(b -1)\n\nSimplify numerator:\n\ns(b -1) - s\u00b2 + s = s(b -1 +1) - s\u00b2 = s*b - s\u00b2 = s(b - s)\n\nThus, c = [s(b - s)] / (b -1)\n\nHmm, so c must be an integer between 0 and b-1. Since s and b are positive integers with s < b (since s \u2264 b-1), then (b - s) is positive, so numerator is s*(b - s). Therefore, c is equal to [s(b - s)]/(b -1). Therefore, in addition to (b -1) dividing s(s -1), it must also divide s(b - s). \n\nWait, but since c must be an integer, the numerator s(b - s) must be divisible by (b -1). So that's another condition. However, since (b -1) divides s(s -1), maybe this is automatically satisfied? Let me see:\n\nSuppose that (b -1) divides s(s -1). Let me see if that implies that (b -1) divides s(b - s):\n\nLet me compute s(b - s) = s b - s\u00b2. \n\nBut from the previous equation, s\u00b2 - s = a*(b -1). Therefore, s\u00b2 = a(b -1) + s. \n\nTherefore, substituting into s b - s\u00b2:\n\ns b - [a(b -1) + s] = s b - a(b -1) - s = s(b -1) - a(b -1) = (s - a)(b -1)\n\nTherefore, s(b - s) = (s - a)(b -1). Therefore, c = [s(b - s)]/(b -1) = (s - a). But s - a is exactly c, which is an integer. So that checks out. So the c being an integer is already enforced by a being an integer. Therefore, as long as (b -1) divides s(s -1), then c is automatically an integer, and since a and c must be digits, their ranges are:\n\na must be between 1 and b-1,\n\nc must be between 0 and b-1,\n\nand since c = s - a, then:\n\nc = s - a must be between 0 and b-1,\n\nso 0 \u2264 s - a \u2264 b -1,\n\nwhich is equivalent to:\n\na \u2264 s \u2264 a + (b -1).\n\nBut since a = (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1), this might need some more constraints, but perhaps as long as s is between 1 and b-1, and a is in the correct range, c will be okay. Let's see:\n\nSuppose s is between 1 and b -1. Let me also note that since a must be at least 1, then (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u22651,\n\nso s\u00b2 - s \u2265 b -1,\n\nand since a must be \u2264 b -1,\n\nthen (s\u00b2 - s)/(b -1) \u2264 b -1,\n\nso s\u00b2 - s \u2264 (b -1)^2.\n\nTherefore, the inequalities we had before.\n\nSo putting this all together, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s between 1 and b-1 (inclusive) such that (b -1) divides s(s -1). \n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to, for each b \u22652, count the number of s in [1, b-1] such that (b -1) divides s(s -1). We need to find the smallest b where this count exceeds 10.\n\nSo our task is to find the minimal b where the number of integers s in 1 to b-1 with s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1) is greater than 10.\n\nAlternatively, since (b -1) divides s(s -1), we can think of this as s(s-1) \u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of s in [1, b-1] satisfying s(s -1) \u22610 mod (b-1). \n\nTo find the minimal b where this count is >10.\n\nHmm, so maybe we can rephrase the problem in terms of divisors. Let me denote d = b -1, so d = b -1, so b = d +1. Then the problem becomes, for d \u22651, find the minimal d +1 (i.e., minimal b) such that the number of s in [1, d] with s(s -1) \u22610 mod d exceeds 10. Then the answer will be d +1.\n\nSo now, the problem is in terms of d: find the smallest d where the number of s in [1,d] with s(s-1) \u22610 mod d is >10. Then b is d +1.\n\nSo perhaps this substitution makes it easier. Let me think of it this way.\n\nWe need to find the smallest d such that the number of s in 1 to d with s(s-1) \u22610 mod d is greater than 10, then the minimal b is d +1.\n\nTherefore, let's think of the equation s(s-1) \u22610 mod d. So for each d, count the number of s in [1,d] where this holds. \n\nTo analyze this equation s(s-1) \u22610 mod d, note that s and s-1 are consecutive integers, so they are coprime. Therefore, their product is divisible by d only if the factors of d are distributed between s and s-1. Since s and s-1 are coprime, d must divide the product s(s-1) only if d1 divides s and d2 divides s-1, where d1 and d2 are coprime divisors of d with d1*d2 =d.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s mod d is equal to the number of pairs (d1,d2) such that d1*d2 =d, gcd(d1,d2)=1, and then the number of solutions s \u22610 mod d1 and s \u22611 mod d2.\n\nBy the Chinese Remainder Theorem, for each such pair (d1,d2), there is a unique solution modulo d. Therefore, the total number of solutions s mod d is equal to the number of such pairs (d1,d2).\n\nWait, but actually, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d1 of d such that d1 divides s and d/d1 divides s-1. Since s and s-1 are coprime, d1 and d/d1 must be coprime, so d1 must divide s and d/d1 must divide s-1, and since gcd(d1, d/d1)=1, the number of solutions is equal to the number of ways to factor d into coprime pairs (d1, d2) where d1*d2=d. Each such factorization corresponds to a unique solution modulo d. \n\nTherefore, the number of solutions s in [1,d] is exactly equal to the number of ways to write d as a product of two coprime positive integers d1 and d2 (with order mattering? Wait, actually, since d1 and d2 are coprime and d1*d2=d, each such pair (d1,d2) is unique up to ordering, but since s \u22610 mod d1 and s\u22611 mod d2, the ordering matters here because switching d1 and d2 would lead to different congruence conditions. However, since d1 and d2 must be coprime and their product is d, each coprime pair (d1,d2) with d1*d2=d and gcd(d1,d2)=1 corresponds to exactly one solution s modulo d. Therefore, the total number of solutions is equal to the number of such coprime ordered pairs (d1,d2). \n\nHowever, since d1 and d2 are coprime and d1*d2 =d, each such pair is determined by a subset of the prime factors of d assigned to d1 and the rest to d2. So the number of such pairs is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. Wait, that might be the case. Let me think:\n\nSuppose d has prime factorization d = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pn^an. Then the number of ways to write d as d1*d2 with gcd(d1,d2)=1 is 2^n, because for each prime factor, you can assign it to d1 or d2, but not both. So each prime has two choices, so total 2^n. However, since d1 and d2 are ordered, so (d1,d2) and (d2,d1) are considered different unless d1=d2=1, but since d \u22651, but in our case, d could be 1, but in our problem d is at least 1 (since b \u22652 implies d =b-1 \u22651). However, when d=1, the equation s(s-1)\u22610 mod 1 is trivial, so all s satisfy it, but since s ranges from 1 to 1, so only one solution. \n\nWait, so in general, for d with n distinct prime factors, the number of coprime ordered pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=d is 2^n. Therefore, the number of solutions s mod d is 2^n. Thus, the number of solutions s in [1,d] is exactly 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. Wait, but let me test this with an example.\n\nTake d=6, which factors into 2*3, so two primes. Then the coprime pairs (d1,d2) are (1,6), (2,3), (3,2), (6,1). Each of these gives a solution s mod 6:\n\nFor (d1=1, d2=6): s \u22610 mod 1 (always true) and s\u22611 mod 6. So s\u22611 mod6.\n\nFor (d1=2, d2=3): s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod3. Solve these:\n\ns \u22610 mod2,\n\ns \u22611 mod3.\n\nPossible solutions: s=4 mod6.\n\nCheck 4 mod2=0, 4 mod3=1. Correct.\n\nFor (d1=3, d2=2): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod2.\n\nSo s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod2.\n\nSolution: s=3 mod6? 3 mod2=1, 3 mod3=0. Yes. So s\u22613 mod6.\n\nWait, but 3 mod2 is 1, so 3 mod2=1? Wait 3 divided by 2 is 1 with remainder 1, so yes. So s=3 mod6.\n\nWait but 3 mod3 is 0, so that works. \n\nFor (d1=6, d2=1): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod1 (always true). So s\u22610 mod6. \n\nTherefore, solutions mod6 are s\u22610,1,3,4 mod6. So in total 4 solutions, which is 2^2=4, since d=6 has 2 distinct primes. \n\nSo that works. Let's check another example. Take d=4, which is 2^2. So number of distinct primes is 1. Then according to the formula, the number of solutions should be 2^1=2. Let's see:\n\nPossible coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=4 and gcd(d1,d2)=1. Since 4 is 2^2, the coprime pairs must have one part 1 and the other 4, or 4 and 1. Because if you split the prime factors, since there is only one prime, you can't split it. So the pairs are (1,4), (4,1). \n\nSo solutions:\n\nFor (1,4): s\u22610 mod1 (any) and s\u22611 mod4. So s\u22611 mod4.\n\nFor (4,1): s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod1 (any). So s\u22610 mod4.\n\nThus, solutions mod4 are s\u22610,1 mod4. So two solutions, which matches 2^1=2.\n\nAnother example, d=12. Prime factors are 2^2*3^1, so two distinct primes. Then number of solutions should be 2^2=4. Wait, but let me check:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\nPossible pairs where d1*d2=12 and gcd(d1,d2)=1. The coprime divisors would be:\n\n1 &12,\n\n3 &4,\n\n4 &3,\n\n12 &1,\n\nWait, but 3 and 4 are coprime. Also, 1 and 12, etc. So total four pairs. Let's see the solutions:\n\nFor (1,12): s\u22610 mod1 and s\u22611 mod12 \u2192 s\u22611 mod12.\n\nFor (3,4): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\nFind s \u22610 mod3 and 1 mod4. Let's see: numbers congruent to 1 mod4: 1,5,9,13,... mod12. 9 mod3=0, so 9 is solution. So s\u22619 mod12.\n\nFor (4,3): s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod3: 1,4,7,10 mod12. Among those, 4 mod4=0, so 4 mod12. 4 mod3=1? 4 mod3 is 1, yes. So s\u22614 mod12.\n\nFor (12,1): s\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod1. So s\u22610 mod12.\n\nThus, solutions mod12 are s\u22610,1,4,9 mod12. So four solutions, which is 2^2=4. That works.\n\nTherefore, the formula holds: the number of solutions s in [1,d] is equal to 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. \n\nWait, but hold on, in the case of d=6, which has two distinct primes, we had four solutions, which is 2^2. For d=4 (one prime), two solutions. For d=12 (two primes), four solutions. \n\nWait, but let me test with d= p^a, a prime power. Let's take d=9 (3^2). Then the number of distinct primes is 1, so solutions should be 2^1=2.\n\nIndeed, coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=9 and gcd(d1,d2)=1:\n\n(1,9) and (9,1). So two solutions.\n\nFor (1,9): s\u22611 mod9,\n\nFor (9,1): s\u22610 mod9,\n\nThus, two solutions. Correct.\n\nAnother example: d=30, which factors into 2*3*5 (three primes). Then the number of solutions should be 2^3=8. Let's see if that's the case.\n\nCoprime pairs (d1,d2) with product 30:\n\nThe coprime divisors must be pairs where one gets some subset of the prime factors, and the other gets the rest. So each prime can go to d1 or d2, so 2^3=8 pairs. Each of these will correspond to a solution. So indeed, there are 8 solutions mod30. \n\nThus, the formula holds. Therefore, the number of solutions s in [1,d] is 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d.\n\nTherefore, the number of b-eautiful numbers for base b is equal to 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of (b-1). Therefore, we need to find the smallest b where 2^{k} >10. Since 2^4=16>10, so we need k \u22654. Because 2^3=8 <10, so the minimal k where 2^k exceeds 10 is k=4. Therefore, the minimal b is the minimal integer such that b-1 has at least four distinct prime factors.\n\nWait, hold on, but is that correct? Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the number of solutions is 2^{number of distinct prime factors of d}. So, if d has k distinct primes, then the number of solutions is 2^k. Therefore, to have more than 10 solutions, we need 2^k >10. The smallest k where 2^k >10 is k=4 (since 2^4=16). Therefore, d must have at least four distinct prime factors. Hence, the minimal d is the smallest number with four distinct prime factors. The minimal such d is 2*3*5*7=210. Therefore, the minimal b would be 210 +1=211? But wait, maybe there's a smaller d with more exponents?\n\nWait, but the number of distinct prime factors is what matters. The minimal number with four distinct prime factors is indeed 2*3*5*7=210. Therefore, the minimal b would be 211. But wait, hold on, perhaps I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"more than ten b-eautiful integers\", so 11 or more. 2^4=16 is more than 10, so that works. But maybe there is a number d with three prime factors but with an exponent such that the number of solutions is higher?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, the formula says that the number of solutions is 2^{number of distinct prime factors}. So even if d has a prime raised to a higher power, the number of distinct prime factors is what counts. For example, d=8=2^3, which has one distinct prime factor, so number of solutions is 2^1=2. So even if the prime is raised to a higher power, the count is still 2^1. Therefore, the exponent doesn't matter. Only the number of distinct primes. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d with four distinct prime factors is 2*3*5*7=210, so the minimal b is 211. But wait, is that correct? Let me check if there is a d with three distinct primes but with the number of solutions higher than 10? Wait, 2^3=8 <10, so no. So the first time we get over 10 is when k=4, so d must have four distinct primes. So 210 is the minimal such d. \n\nBut wait, hold on. Let me verify with an example. Take d=210 (2*3*5*7). Then the number of solutions is 2^4=16, so the number of b-eautiful numbers would be 16. That's over 10. So b=211 would be the minimal such base? \n\nBut wait, maybe there is a smaller d which has four prime factors but with some exponents? Wait, but 2*3*5*7 is the minimal number with four distinct primes. Any other number with four primes would be larger. So 210 is indeed the minimal d with four distinct primes. So then, the minimal b is 211. But the problem says \"Find the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\" \n\nBut wait, hold on, hold on. Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in my logic here. Let me go back.\n\nWait, the formula says that the number of solutions s in [1,d] is equal to 2^{k}, where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. Therefore, if d has k distinct primes, then the number of solutions is 2^k. So to get more than 10, we need 2^k >10. The minimal k is 4, so minimal d with k=4 is 210, so minimal b is 211.\n\nBut let me check with d=60. Let me see, d=60 has prime factors 2,3,5, so three primes. Therefore, number of solutions is 8. Which is less than 10. \n\nWait, but maybe there are some numbers with three prime factors but with more solutions? For example, if the number has three prime factors but with exponents, like 12=2^2*3, which has two distinct primes, so solutions are 4. \n\nWait, but even if a number has three distinct prime factors, like 30=2*3*5, the number of solutions is 8, which is still less than 10. \n\nWait, so the next number after 30 with four prime factors is 2*3*5*7=210. So that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut before I accept that, let me check if there is a case where the number of solutions could be more than 2^k. For example, if d is 1. Then d=1 has zero prime factors, so 2^0=1. Which is correct, since s can only be 1. \n\nWait, but what about d=1, which would correspond to b=2. The number of solutions would be 1, which is 2^0=1. Correct. \n\nWait, another case: d= p^a*q^b, with two primes. The number of solutions is 4, as in d=6. \n\nTherefore, the formula holds. \n\nWait, but hold on. Wait a second. Let me check with d=16, which is 2^4. Then the number of solutions is 2^1=2. Let me see:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=16 and gcd(d1,d2)=1. Since 16 is 2^4, the coprime divisors must be 1 and 16. So two pairs: (1,16) and (16,1). So solutions s\u22611 mod16 and s\u22610 mod16. So two solutions. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the formula holds. \n\nTherefore, the formula is correct. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d where 2^{number of distinct prime factors of d} exceeds 10 is when the number of prime factors is 4, so the minimal such d is 2*3*5*7=210. Therefore, the minimal b is 211. \n\nHowever, before finalizing this answer, let me check if there's a case where d has a repeated prime factor but somehow the number of solutions is higher. For example, suppose d is a square of a prime, but no, then it still has only one distinct prime factor, so the solutions would still be 2. \n\nAlternatively, if d is 1, which gives 1 solution, etc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is slightly different? Wait, the formula counts the number of coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=d, and each such pair gives a unique solution. The number of such pairs is indeed 2^k where k is the number of distinct primes, since each prime can go to d1 or d2. \n\nTherefore, the formula is correct. Therefore, the minimal d is 210, so the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut wait, let me check with d=2*3*5*7=210. The number of solutions is 16. \n\nWait, but let's see, maybe the problem counts numbers where s can be equal to 0? Wait, no, because s is the square root of n, and n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must be at least b (since the first digit is at least 1, so the number is at least 1*b +0 =b). Therefore, n >=b, so s = sqrt(n) >= sqrt(b). Since b = d+1, so sqrt(d+1). \n\nWait, but the formula counts s from 1 to d. But in reality, s must satisfy s^2 >= b (since n is two-digit in base b, so n >=b). So s^2 >=b =d+1. Therefore, s must be at least ceil(sqrt(d+1)). \n\nTherefore, perhaps the actual number of solutions is the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod d. However, according to our previous analysis, the number of solutions in [1,d] is 2^k, but some of these solutions may have s < sqrt(d+1). So the actual count might be less. Therefore, my previous conclusion may be incorrect because it didn't consider that some solutions s might be too small (i.e., s^2 < b). \n\nOh no! That's a crucial point I missed. The problem states that n must be a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b and b\u00b2 -1. Therefore, the square root s = sqrt(n) must satisfy sqrt(b) \u2264 s < sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) \u2248 b. But specifically, s must satisfy s^2 \u2265 b and s^2 \u2264 b\u00b2 -1. So s must be between ceil(sqrt(b)) and floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is slightly less than b, so floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)) = b-1. Therefore, s must be in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1].\n\nTherefore, in terms of d = b -1, so b = d +1, then s must be in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d].\n\nTherefore, the number of valid s is the number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod d. \n\nTherefore, even though the total number of solutions in [1,d] is 2^k, some of them may lie below ceil(sqrt(d+1)), and thus not contribute to the count of b-eautiful numbers. \n\nTherefore, my previous conclusion was incorrect because it didn't take into account that some solutions s may be too small (i.e., s^2 < b). \n\nTherefore, we need to adjust the count to exclude those s which are too small. \n\nThis complicates things. Let me try to re-express the problem with this in mind.\n\nGiven that, for each d (where b =d+1), the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of solutions s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] such that s(s-1) \u22610 mod d. \n\nSo the total solutions are 2^k, but we need to subtract those solutions s which are less than ceil(sqrt(d+1)). \n\nTherefore, the problem now becomes: find the smallest d such that the number of s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d] with s(s-1) \u22610 mod d is greater than 10. \n\nTherefore, the previous approach was incomplete. Let's see how this affects the result. \n\nLet me take the previous example where d=210 (b=211). Then sqrt(d+1)=sqrt(211)\u224814.52, so ceil(sqrt(d+1))=15. So s must be between 15 and 210. \n\nThe total solutions in [1,210] are 16 (since 210 has four distinct prime factors). But how many of these 16 solutions are \u226515?\n\nWe need to check how many of the 16 solutions s in [1,210] satisfy s\u226515. \n\nBut this requires knowing the actual solutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe in some cases, even with four prime factors, the number of valid s is still not enough? Hmm, this complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal d is smaller than 210? Let's think. \n\nWait, let's try to see for smaller d. Let me pick d=60 (so b=61). \n\nd=60 has three distinct prime factors (2,3,5). So the total number of solutions is 8. \n\nNow, sqrt(d+1)=sqrt(61)\u22487.81, so ceil(sqrt(61))=8. So s must be between 8 and 60. \n\nTherefore, we need to count the number of solutions between 8 and 60. \n\nTotal solutions in [1,60] are 8. So how many of them are \u22658? \n\nWe can compute the solutions s for d=60:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d1,d2) with d1*d2=60 and gcd(d1,d2)=1. The distinct prime factors are 2,3,5. So the number of coprime pairs is 2^3=8. Let's list them:\n\nThe prime factors are 2,3,5. Each can go to d1 or d2. \n\nThe possible coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,60), (2,30), (3,20), (4,15), (5,12), (6,10), (10,6), (12,5), (15,4), (20,3), (30,2), (60,1). Wait, but actually, each pair is determined by the assignment of primes. Let me think better:\n\nEach prime can be assigned to d1 or d2. Since 60 factors into 2^2*3*5, the coprime pairs must have d1 and d2 such that all the primes are in one or the other. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to list all possible coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\n- Assign all primes to d1: d1=60, d2=1\n\n- Assign all primes to d2: d1=1, d2=60\n\n- Assign 2 to d1, 3 and 5 to d2: d1=4 (since 2^2), d2=15 (3*5)\n\nWait no, actually, since d1 must be a divisor of 60, and d2 must be 60/d1, and coprime. Let me list all coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\nPossible coprime divisors:\n\n1 and 60,\n\n3 and 20 (since 3 and 20 are coprime),\n\n4 and 15 (4 is 2^2, 15 is 3*5; coprime),\n\n5 and 12 (5 and 12 are coprime),\n\nAlso:\n\n20 and 3,\n\n15 and 4,\n\n12 and 5,\n\nAnd 60 and1,\n\nWait, but also:\n\nWait, 6 and 10? 6 and 10 have a common factor 2, so no. 10 and 6 are not coprime. \n\nSimilarly, 2 and 30? 2 and 30 have common factor 2. \n\nSo the coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,60),\n\n(3,20),\n\n(4,15),\n\n(5,12),\n\n(20,3),\n\n(15,4),\n\n(12,5),\n\n(60,1)\n\nTotal 8 pairs. \n\nNow for each of these pairs, we can find the solution s mod60:\n\nFor (d1=1, d2=60): s\u22610 mod1 and s\u22611 mod60 \u21d2 s\u22611 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=3, d2=20): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod20. Let's solve:\n\nFind s \u22610 mod3,\n\ns\u22611 mod20.\n\nLet s=20k+1. Then 20k+1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d220k \u2261-1 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k \u2261-1 mod3 \u21d22k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3. So k=3m+1. Thus s=20*(3m+1)+1=60m+21. So solutions mod60 are s\u226121 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=4, d2=15): s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\nLet s=15k+1. Then 15k+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k\u22611 mod4. Thus k=4m+1, so s=15*(4m+1)+1=60m+16. So s\u226116 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=5, d2=12): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod12.\n\nLet s=12k+1. Then 12k+1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d212k \u2261-1 mod5 \u21d212\u22612 mod5 \u21d22k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d22k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k\u22612 mod5. Thus, k=5m+2 \u21d2 s=12*(5m+2)+1=60m+25. So s\u226125 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=20, d2=3): s\u22610 mod20 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=20k. Then 20k\u22611 mod3 \u21d220\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=20*(3m+2)=60m+40. So s\u226140 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=15, d2=4): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\ns=15k. 15k \u22611 mod4 \u21d215\u22613 mod4 \u21d23k\u22611 mod4 \u21d2k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k=4m+3 \u21d2s=15*(4m+3)=60m+45. So s\u226145 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=12, d2=5): s\u22610 mod12 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns=12k. 12k\u22611 mod5 \u21d212\u22612 mod5 \u21d22k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22613 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+3 \u21d2s=12*(5m+3)=60m+36. So s\u226136 mod60.\n\nFor (d1=60, d2=1): s\u22610 mod60 and s\u22611 mod1 \u21d2s\u22610 mod60.\n\nThus, the solutions mod60 are:\n\n1, 16, 21, 25, 36, 40, 45, 60 mod60.\n\nTherefore, in the range s from 1 to60, the solutions are s=1,16,21,25,36,40,45,60. \n\nNow, the valid s must be between ceil(sqrt(61))=8 and 60. So exclude s=1. The valid solutions are 16,21,25,36,40,45,60. That's 7 numbers. \n\nTherefore, for d=60 (b=61), there are 7 b-eautiful numbers, which is less than 10. \n\nSo even with three prime factors, which gives 8 solutions, only 7 are valid because one is too small. \n\nNow, let's try d=105 (so b=106). Let me see:\n\nd=105 factors into 3*5*7. So three distinct primes. So the number of solutions is 8. \n\nsqrt(106)\u224810.29, so ceil is 11. \n\nSo s must be between 11 and 105. \n\nThe solutions would be similar to above. Let me see:\n\nThe coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\nPrime factors 3,5,7. \n\nPossible coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\n(1,105), (3,35), (5,21), (7,15), (35,3), (21,5), (15,7), (105,1). \n\nThus, eight pairs. \n\nEach gives a solution s mod105. \n\nLet me compute them:\n\nFor (1,105): s\u22611 mod105.\n\nFor (3,35): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod35.\n\nSolve s=35k +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d235k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d235\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d22k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2s=35*(3m+1)+1=105m+36. So s\u226136 mod105.\n\nFor (5,21): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod21.\n\ns=21k +1 \u22610 mod5 \u21d221k \u2261-1 mod5 \u21d221\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+4 \u21d2s=21*(5m+4)+1=105m+85. So s\u226185 mod105.\n\nFor (7,15): s\u22610 mod7 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns=15k +1 \u22610 mod7 \u21d215k \u2261-1 mod7 \u21d215\u22611 mod7 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod7 \u21d2k=7m+6 \u21d2s=15*(7m+6)+1=105m+91. So s\u226191 mod105.\n\nFor (35,3): s\u22610 mod35 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=35k \u22611 mod3 \u21d235\u22612 mod3 \u21d22k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=35*(3m+2)=105m+70. So s\u226170 mod105.\n\nFor (21,5): s\u22610 mod21 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns=21k \u22611 mod5 \u21d221\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+1 \u21d2s=21*(5m+1)=105m+21. So s\u226121 mod105.\n\nFor (15,7): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod7.\n\ns=15k \u22611 mod7 \u21d215\u22611 mod7 \u21d2k\u22611 mod7 \u21d2k=7m+1 \u21d2s=15*(7m+1)=105m+15. So s\u226115 mod105.\n\nFor (105,1): s\u22610 mod105.\n\nThus, solutions mod105 are: 1,15,21,36,70,85,91,105. \n\nThe valid s must be between 11 and 105. Excluding s=1, the valid ones are 15,21,36,70,85,91,105. That's 7 solutions again. \n\nSame as before. \n\nHmm. Let's try d=120. Let me see. \n\nd=120 factors into 2^3*3*5. So three distinct primes. Thus, number of solutions is 8. \n\nsqrt(121)=11, so s must be from 11 to 120.\n\nLet me compute solutions for d=120.\n\nPrime factors are 2,3,5. The coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\nEach prime can go to d1 or d2. \n\nPossible coprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\n(1,120),\n\n(3,40), (since 3 and 40 are coprime),\n\n(5,24),\n\n(8,15),\n\n(40,3),\n\n(24,5),\n\n(15,8),\n\n(120,1).\n\nWait, let me do this systematically. \n\nPrime factors are 2,3,5. Assign each to d1 or d2.\n\nPossible assignments:\n\n- All primes to d1: d1=120, d2=1\n\n- All primes to d2: d1=1, d2=120\n\n- Assign 2 to d1, 3 and5 to d2: d1=8 (since 2^3), d2= 15 (3*5)\n\nWait, no. Wait, d1 must be a divisor of 120. Let me think in terms of coprime pairs. \n\nAlternatively, since d=120=2^3*3*5. \n\nCoprime pairs (d1,d2):\n\nEach prime factor must be entirely in d1 or d2. \n\nSo possible coprime pairs:\n\n- d1=1, d2=120,\n\n- d1=3, d2=40 (since 3 is assigned to d1, and 2^3*5 to d2),\n\n- d1=5, d2=24 (5 assigned to d1, 2^3*3 to d2),\n\n- d1=15, d2=8 (3*5 in d1, 2^3 in d2),\n\n- d1=8, d2=15,\n\n- d1=24, d2=5,\n\n- d1=40, d2=3,\n\n- d1=120, d2=1.\n\nSo eight pairs. \n\nNow compute each solution:\n\n(1,120): s\u22611 mod120.\n\n(3,40): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod40.\n\nLet s=40k +1. Then 40k+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d240k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d240\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=40*(3m+2)+1=120m+81. So s\u226181 mod120.\n\n(5,24): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod24.\n\ns=24k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d224k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d224\u22614 mod5 \u21d24k\u2261-1 \u21d24k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+1 \u21d2s=24*(5m+1)+1=120m+25. So s\u226125 mod120.\n\n(15,8): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod8.\n\ns=8k +1\u22610 mod15 \u21d28k\u2261-1 mod15 \u21d28k\u226114 mod15 \u21d2Multiply both sides by inverse of 8 mod15. 8*2=16\u22611 mod15 \u21d2 inverse is 2. Thus, k\u226114*2=28\u226113 mod15 \u21d2k=15m+13 \u21d2s=8*(15m+13)+1=120m+105. So s\u2261105 mod120.\n\n(8,15): s\u22610 mod8 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns=15k +1\u22610 mod8 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod8 \u21d215\u22617 mod8 \u21d27k\u2261-1 mod8 \u21d27k\u22617 mod8 \u21d2k\u22611 mod8 \u21d2k=8m+1 \u21d2s=15*(8m+1)+1=120m+16. So s\u226116 mod120.\n\n(24,5): s\u22610 mod24 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns=24k\u22611 mod5 \u21d224\u22614 mod5 \u21d24k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+4 \u21d2s=24*(5m+4)=120m+96. So s\u226196 mod120.\n\n(40,3): s\u22610 mod40 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=40k\u22611 mod3 \u21d240\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2s=40*(3m+1)=120m+40. So s\u226140 mod120.\n\n(120,1): s\u22610 mod120.\n\nThus, the solutions mod120 are:\n\n1,16,25,40,81,96,105,120 mod120.\n\nNow, valid s must be between 11 and 120. So exclude s=1. The valid solutions are 16,25,40,81,96,105,120. That's 7 again. \n\nHmm, so even with three primes, we still get 7 solutions. So even with three primes, it's still 7. \n\nWait, maybe trying d=210 (b=211). Let's see:\n\nd=210 factors into 2*3*5*7. So four distinct primes. Number of solutions is 16. \n\nsqrt(d+1)=sqrt(211)\u224814.52, so ceil is 15. \n\nWe need to find solutions between 15 and 210. \n\nThe solutions are 16 in total. Let me see how many of them are \u226515. \n\nAssuming all solutions except s=1 are above 15? Let me think. The solutions mod210 would be various numbers, but likely most are above 15. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal s is 1, then others are spread out. Let me try to find a few solutions:\n\nTake the coprime pairs for d=210:\n\nPrime factors are 2,3,5,7. Each prime can be assigned to d1 or d2. \n\nLet me pick a few coprime pairs and compute their solutions:\n\nFirst, (1,210): s\u22611 mod210. So s=1,211,... but in 1 to210, s=1 and 211 is beyond. So only s=1.\n\nSecond, (2,105): s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod105.\n\ns=105k+1\u22610 mod2 \u21d2105k is odd, so 105 is odd \u21d2k must be odd \u21d2k=2m+1 \u21d2s=105*(2m+1)+1=210m +106. So mod210, s\u2261106 mod210.\n\nThird, (3,70): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod70.\n\ns=70k +1 \u22610 mod3 \u21d270k \u2261-1 mod3 \u21d270\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=70*(3m+2)+1=210m+141. So s\u2261141 mod210.\n\nFourth, (5,42): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod42.\n\ns=42k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d242k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d242\u22612 mod5 \u21d22k\u2261-1 \u21d22k\u22614 mod5 \u21d2k\u22612 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+2 \u21d2s=42*(5m+2)+1=210m+85. So s\u226185 mod210.\n\nFifth, (6,35): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod35.\n\nWait, wait, let me pick another pair. Maybe (7,30):\n\ns\u22610 mod7 and s\u22611 mod30.\n\ns=30k+1\u22610 mod7 \u21d230k\u2261-1 mod7 \u21d230\u22612 mod7 \u21d22k\u2261-1 \u21d22k\u22616 mod7 \u21d2k\u22613 mod7 \u21d2k=7m+3 \u21d2s=30*(7m+3)+1=210m+91. So s\u226191 mod210.\n\nContinuing, but this is tedious. Let me instead note that the minimal solutions (other than 1) will be at least 16, but perhaps not. Wait, for example, the solution for (2,105) gives s=106 mod210, so 106 is above 15. The solution for (3,70) gives 141, which is also above 15. The solution for (5,42) gives 85 mod210, which is 85, also above 15. The solution for (7,30) gives 91. \n\nAnother solution pair: (15,14):\n\nWait, let me think of another coprime pair. For example, (14,15):\n\nWait, d1=14 and d2=15. Since 14=2*7 and 15=3*5, they are coprime. So:\n\ns\u22610 mod14 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns=14k \u22611 mod15 \u21d214k\u22611 mod15 \u21d214\u2261-1 mod15 \u21d2-k\u22611 mod15 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod15 \u21d2k=15m-1. \n\nThus, s=14*(15m -1)=210m -14. But since we're mod210, this is equivalent to s\u2261-14 mod210 \u21d2 s\u2261196 mod210.\n\nThus, s=196 mod210.\n\nSimilarly, another pair: (10,21):\n\nd1=10 (2*5), d2=21 (3*7). \n\ns\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod21.\n\ns=21k +1\u22610 mod10 \u21d221k\u2261-1 mod10 \u21d221\u22611 mod10 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod10 \u21d2k=10m-1 \u21d2s=21*(10m-1)+1=210m -20. So mod210, s\u2261-20 mod210 \u21d2190 mod210.\n\nSo s=190 mod210.\n\nContinuing this, it seems all solutions except s=1 are above 15. Therefore, in total, there are 16 solutions mod210, one of which is s=1, so 15 solutions between 15 and 210. \n\nWait, 16 total solutions minus 1 (s=1) gives 15 solutions. Since 15 is still less than 10? Wait, no, 15 is greater than 10. Wait, 15 is more than 10. Therefore, for d=210 (b=211), there are 15 b-eautiful numbers, which is more than ten. \n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me check again. If there are 16 total solutions in [1,210], with s=1 being the only one below 15, then the remaining 15 are valid. Therefore, 15 is more than ten. So b=211 would be a candidate. \n\nBut maybe there is a smaller d where the number of solutions minus those too small is more than ten?\n\nLet's see. Let me try d= 2*3*5*7=210 is the first with four primes. But let me check another d with four distinct primes but smaller? Wait, no. 2*3*5*7=210 is the smallest number with four distinct primes. \n\nWait, but what about d=105 (3*5*7) which has three primes, but maybe with some exponent?\n\nWait, no. Let me think of numbers with four prime factors but not necessarily distinct. But the formula counts the number of distinct primes. So even if a number has four prime factors but some are repeated, like 2*2*3*5, which is 60, which has three distinct primes. So no. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d with four distinct primes is indeed 210. \n\nBut let me check another number with four distinct primes but smaller? 2*3*5*7=210 is the minimal. \n\nTherefore, the minimal b is 211. \n\nHowever, perhaps there is a number d with three distinct primes but the number of solutions minus the small ones is more than 10?\n\nWait, let's see, suppose d=2^4*3*5*7, but that's larger. \n\nWait, let me think of d= 2*3*5*7=210 is the minimal. So then the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut let me check another d with four primes but arranged differently. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a d with three distinct primes but with some solutions just above sqrt(d+1), so the total solutions minus the ones below threshold is more than 10?\n\nWait, let's try d= 210, which gives 15 solutions, which is over 10. \n\nWait, but before that, let me see for d= 105 (three primes, three primes gives 8 total solutions, but only 7 valid). \n\nWait, maybe if the number has four prime factors, but one of them is 1? No, primes are at least 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe d= 2*3*5*7=210 is indeed minimal. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of d= 2*3*5*11= 330, which would be higher. \n\nAlternatively, let me check d= 210's predecessor with three primes: 2*3*5*7 is 210. \n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut the problem says \"Find the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\"\n\nHowever, let me think if there's a case where the number of solutions is higher even with three prime factors. For example, suppose d has a prime factor with exponent which allows more solutions? Wait, but no, the number of solutions is based on the number of distinct primes. \n\nWait, let me think of d= 16. Wait, 16 is 2^4, so one distinct prime. The number of solutions is 2. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps d= 12. Let's see:\n\nd=12 (2^2*3). Two distinct primes. So total solutions are 4. sqrt(13)=3.605, so ceil is 4. So solutions between 4 and12. The solutions are:\n\nFor d=12, the coprime pairs are:\n\n(1,12), (3,4), (4,3), (12,1).\n\nThe solutions mod12 are 1, 4, 9, 0 mod12. \n\nWait, let me compute them properly:\n\n(1,12): s\u22611 mod12.\n\n(3,4): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod4.\n\nSolve s=4k+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d24k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d2k\u22612 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=4*(3m+2)+1=12m+9 \u21d2s\u22619 mod12.\n\n(4,3): s\u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=3k+1\u22610 mod4 \u21d23k\u2261-1 mod4 \u21d2k\u22613 mod4 \u21d2k=4m+3 \u21d2s=3*(4m+3)+1=12m+10 \u21d2s\u226110 mod12? Wait, let me recheck:\n\nWait, solving s \u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nLet s=4k. Then 4k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2s=4*(3m+1)=12m+4 \u21d2s\u22614 mod12.\n\nWait, so s=4 mod12.\n\nWait, that contradicts my previous thought. Let me redo:\n\nFor (4,3): s \u22610 mod4 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\nLet s=4k. Then 4k \u22611 mod3 \u21d24k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 (since 4\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3). So k=3m+1 \u21d2s=4*(3m+1)=12m+4 \u21d2s\u22614 mod12.\n\nSimilarly, for (12,1): s\u22610 mod12.\n\nThus, solutions mod12 are 1,4,9,0 (but 0 mod12 is s=12). So the solutions in [1,12] are 1,4,9,12.\n\nNow, valid s must be \u2265ceil(sqrt(13))=4. So the valid solutions are 4,9,12. That's 3 solutions. \n\nHmm, so with two primes, we get 3 solutions. \n\nSo the formula seems to hold. \n\nTherefore, returning to the problem, the minimal d where the number of valid solutions exceeds 10 is when the total solutions minus those below the threshold is over 10. Since for four distinct primes, total solutions are 16, and only s=1 is below the threshold (assuming sqrt(d+1) is above 1), so 16 -1=15 solutions. \n\nWait, sqrt(d+1) when d=210 is sqrt(211)\u224814.5, so ceil is 15. So the threshold is 15. So any solution s less than 15 is invalid. The solutions are 1, and others. \n\nBut in the example above with d=210, the solutions mod210 include s=1 and others like 106,141,85,91, etc. So s=1 is the only one below 15. So total valid solutions are 15. Which is more than ten. \n\nTherefore, b=211 is the minimal base. \n\nWait, but let me check for d=105 (three primes), but if there's another d with three primes where the number of valid solutions is over ten? \n\nWait, for example, take d= 2*3*5*7=210 (four primes) gives 15 solutions. \n\nWhat about d= 2*3*5*11= 330 (four primes). But that's bigger. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a d with four prime factors but smaller than 210? \n\nWait, 2*3*5*7 is 210. The next smallest would be replacing 7 with a smaller prime, but 2,3,5,7 are the first four primes. \n\nThus, 210 is indeed the minimal d with four distinct primes. \n\nTherefore, the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut wait, let me think again. Maybe there is a case where d has four prime factors, but one of them is repeated? Like 2*2*3*5. But then the number of distinct primes is three, so still gives 8 solutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the minimal d with four prime factors is indeed 210, so the answer is 211. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps my initial assumption is wrong and the formula counts all solutions even below the threshold, but the problem counts only those with two digits, so maybe there's a different approach. \n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Let's suppose that for each base b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers s between ceil(sqrt(b)) and b-1 such that s(s-1) is divisible by (b-1). \n\nTo find the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps there's a better way than my previous approach. Let me try to compute for some values of b and see. \n\nLet me try b= 240 (d=239). Wait, but 239 is a prime, so the number of solutions would be 2, which is too small. \n\nAlternatively, take b= 120 (d=119). 119=7*17, two primes. So solutions count is 4. \n\nHmm, not enough. \n\nAlternatively, take b= 210 (d=209). Wait, 209 is 11*19, two primes. So solutions count is 4. \n\nHmm. \n\nAlternatively, b= 211 (d=210). As before, 210 has four primes, so solutions count is 16, minus 1 gives 15. \n\nTherefore, 15>10. \n\nAlternatively, let me check for b= 120 (d=119). \n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula for the number of solutions. Let me think again. \n\nWait, the formula says that the number of solutions is 2^k where k is the number of distinct prime factors of d. So for d=210, which has four primes, it's 16. \n\nSo if I can find a d with four prime factors smaller than 210, then that would be better, but I don't think such a d exists. \n\nTherefore, the minimal d is indeed 210, leading to b=211. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 211. \n\nWait, but the problem says \"Find the least integer b \u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\" \n\nWait, but maybe there's a number with three distinct primes where the number of valid solutions is more than 10? For instance, let's see for d= 2520 (which is 2^3*3^2*5*7). It has four distinct primes, so solutions would be 16. But that's larger. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a number with three primes where the number of valid solutions is more than 10. Let me see:\n\nSuppose d has three distinct primes, so total solutions are 8. But to get more than 10, need at least 11 solutions. 8 is not enough. \n\nWait, unless there are multiple solutions in the valid range. Let me see for d= 210 (four primes) gives 15 solutions. \n\nWait, perhaps there is a d with five distinct primes? But the minimal such d would be 2*3*5*7*11=2310, which is way larger than 210. \n\nTherefore, it seems that 211 is the minimal b. \n\nWait, but let me think of another angle. Maybe the formula counts each solution mod d, but in the range [1,d], so the total solutions are indeed 2^k. But the valid solutions are those s in [ceil(sqrt(d+1)), d]. So the count is 2^k minus the number of solutions below ceil(sqrt(d+1)). \n\nTherefore, if we can find a d where 2^k minus the number of solutions below the threshold exceeds 10. \n\nSuppose d= 210, then k=4, so 16 solutions. How many of them are below ceil(sqrt(211))=15? \n\nOnly s=1. So 16-1=15>10. \n\nIf we take a d with k=4, but with more solutions below the threshold, maybe it's possible to have a smaller d. \n\nWait, but the minimal d with four primes is 210. Let me think if there is a d with four primes but with a higher sqrt(d+1), so that more solutions are below the threshold. \n\nWait, but sqrt(d+1) increases as d increases, so the threshold would be higher. Therefore, with a smaller d, the threshold is lower, so fewer solutions are excluded. \n\nWait, for example, take d= 2*3*5*7=210, which is minimal. \n\nSuppose there's a smaller d with four primes, but that's impossible. \n\nTherefore, 211 is indeed the minimal base. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 211. \n\nBut wait, I have a feeling that maybe the problem expects a smaller answer. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that all solutions except s=1 are valid. Let me check with d= 210:\n\nIf d=210, then the solutions are s=1 and other solutions like 106, etc., but perhaps there are more solutions below 15?\n\nWait, let me think of a solution pair like (2,105). The solution s=106 mod210 is 106, which is above 15. \n\nAnother solution pair (3,70): solution is 141 mod210, which is 141. \n\nAnother solution pair (5,42): s=85 mod210, which is 85. \n\n(7,30): 91 mod210. \n\n(6,35): s= ?\n\nWait, let me take another coprime pair (6,35). \n\nWait, d1=6 and d2=35. \n\nWait, 6 and 35 are coprime (6=2*3, 35=5*7). So:\n\ns\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod35.\n\ns=35k+1 \u22610 mod6 \u21d235k\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d235\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d2-k\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d2k\u22611 mod6 \u21d2k=6m+1 \u21d2s=35*(6m+1)+1=210m+36. \n\nThus, s\u226136 mod210. \n\nSo s=36 mod210. 36 is above 15. \n\nAnother pair: (10,21): \n\nd1=10 and d2=21 (coprime). \n\ns\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod21.\n\nSolutions like 190 mod210. \n\nAnother pair: (14,15): \n\ns\u22610 mod14 and s\u22611 mod15 \u21d2196 mod210. \n\nAnother pair: (15,14):\n\ns\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod14 \u21d2?\n\nWait, let me pick another pair (5,42):\n\ns=85 mod210. \n\n(21,10):\n\ns\u22610 mod21 and s\u22611 mod10. \n\ns=10k+1\u22610 mod21 \u21d210k\u2261-1 mod21 \u21d210k\u226120 mod21 \u21d2k\u22612 mod21/ gcd(10,21)=1 \u21d2k=21m+2 \u21d2s=10*(21m+2)+1=210m+21. So s\u226121 mod210. 21 is above 15. \n\nSimilarly, (35,6):\n\ns\u22610 mod35 and s\u22611 mod6.\n\ns=35k\u22611 mod6 \u21d235\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d2-k\u22611 mod6 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod6 \u21d2k=6m-1 \u21d2s=35*(6m-1)=210m -35 \u21d2 mod210 is 175 mod210. \n\nSo 175 is above 15. \n\nAnother pair (70,3):\n\ns\u22610 mod70 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=70k\u22611 mod3 \u21d270\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2s=70*(3m+1)=210m+70 \u21d270 mod210. \n\n70 is above 15. \n\nSimilarly, (42,5):\n\ns\u22610 mod42 and s\u22611 mod5 \u21d2 solution like 85 mod210? \n\nWait, anyway, all the solutions except s=1 are above 15. \n\nTherefore, total valid solutions are 15, which is over ten. \n\nTherefore, b=211 is indeed the minimal base. \n\nHowever, I recall that in the problem's example, 81 is 13-eautiful. Let me check for base 13:\n\nd=12 (b=13). d=12 has two distinct primes (2 and 3), so number of solutions is 4. \n\nThe valid s must be between ceil(sqrt(13))=4 and 12. \n\nThe solutions mod12 are 1,4,9,12. \n\nValid solutions are 4,9,12. So three numbers. \n\nIndeed, 81 is one of them (s=9, so n=81). The other two would be:\n\nFor s=4: n=16. In base13, 16 is 13+3, so digits 1 and3. Sum is 1+3=4, which is sqrt(16). \n\nSimilarly, s=12: n=144. In base13, 144 divided by13 is 11*13=143, so 11*13 +1=144? No, 11*13 is 143, so 144 is 11*13 +1 \u2192 digits 11 and 1. Their sum is 12, which is sqrt(144). So yes, those are valid. \n\nTherefore, three numbers, which matches the count. \n\nTherefore, the formula holds. \n\nThus, my conclusion is that the minimal b is 211. \n\nHowever, I wonder if there's a mistake in assuming that all solutions except s=1 are valid. Let me check another example. Let's take d=30 (b=31). \n\nd=30 has three primes (2,3,5). So solutions count is 8. \n\nsqrt(31)=5.56, so ceil is6. \n\nSolutions mod30 are 1, 6, 10, 16, 21, 25, 26, 30. \n\nWait, let me compute them:\n\nThe coprime pairs for d=30 (2*3*5):\n\n(1,30), (2,15), (3,10), (5,6), (15,2), (10,3), (6,5), (30,1).\n\nSolutions mod30:\n\n(1,30): s\u22611 mod30.\n\n(2,15): s\u22610 mod2 and s\u22611 mod15.\n\ns=15k+1\u22610 mod2 \u21d215k\u2261-1 mod2 \u21d215 is odd \u21d2k must be odd \u21d2k=2m+1 \u21d2s=15*(2m+1)+1=30m+16 \u21d2s\u226116 mod30.\n\n(3,10): s\u22610 mod3 and s\u22611 mod10.\n\ns=10k+1\u22610 mod3 \u21d210k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d210\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+2 \u21d2s=10*(3m+2)+1=30m+21 \u21d2s\u226121 mod30.\n\n(5,6): s\u22610 mod5 and s\u22611 mod6.\n\ns=6k+1\u22610 mod5 \u21d26k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d26\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u2261-1 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+4 \u21d2s=6*(5m+4)+1=30m+25 \u21d2s\u226125 mod30.\n\n(15,2): s\u22610 mod15 and s\u22611 mod2.\n\ns=15k\u22611 mod2 \u21d215k\u22611 mod2 \u21d2k\u22611 mod2 \u21d2k=2m+1 \u21d2s=15*(2m+1)=30m+15 \u21d2s\u226115 mod30.\n\nWait, but 15 mod30 is 15. \n\nWait, 15 mod2=1, so that's correct. \n\n(10,3): s\u22610 mod10 and s\u22611 mod3.\n\ns=10k\u22611 mod3 \u21d210k\u22611 mod3 \u21d210\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k\u22611 mod3 \u21d2k=3m+1 \u21d2s=10*(3m+1)=30m+10 \u21d2s\u226110 mod30.\n\n(6,5): s\u22610 mod6 and s\u22611 mod5.\n\ns=6k\u22611 mod5 \u21d26k\u22611 mod5 \u21d26\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k\u22611 mod5 \u21d2k=5m+1 \u21d2s=6*(5m+1)=30m+6 \u21d2s\u22616 mod30.\n\n(30,1): s\u22610 mod30.\n\nTherefore, the solutions mod30 are 1,6,10,15,16,21,25,30 mod30. \n\nThe valid s must be between 6 and30. So exclude s=1. The valid solutions are 6,10,15,16,21,25,30. That's seven solutions. \n\nIndeed, 2^3=8 total solutions, minus one gives seven. \n\nTherefore, for b=31, there are seven b-eautiful numbers. \n\nTherefore, the formula holds. \n\nTherefore, I think my reasoning is correct, and the minimal b is 211. \n\nBut let me check one more case for d= 210. \n\nTake s=106. Then n=106\u00b2=11236. \n\nExpressed in base b=211, since 106 = a*211 + c? Wait no. Wait, in base b, n must be two digits: n= a*b +c. \n\nWait, n= s\u00b2 = (a*b +c). But since s = a +c, so substituting:\n\n(a +c)^2 = a*b +c.\n\nWith b=211, s=106:\n\na +c =106,\n\na*211 +c =106\u00b2=11236.\n\nSubtract the first equation from the second:\n\na*211 +c - (a +c) =11236 -106\u00b2,\n\na*(211 -1) = 11236 -11236,\n\nWait, wait, 106 squared is exactly (a*211 +c). Let me compute:\n\nWait, let's compute a and c for s=106:\n\nFrom s(s-1)/(b-1)= a. \n\nHere, s=106, b=211, so d=210:\n\na= (106*105)/210 = (106/2)*(105/105) =53* (105/105)=53*1=53? Wait, let me compute:\n\n106*105 = 11130,\n\n11130 divided by 210 is 11130/210 = 53. So a=53. \n\nThen c= s -a =106 -53=53. \n\nThus, the number is 53*211 +53 =53*(211 +1)=53*212= 53*(200+12)=53*200 +53*12=10600 +636=11236. Which is 106\u00b2. \n\nThe digits are a=53 and c=53. Since base 211 allows digits up to 210, so both are valid. \n\nTherefore, that works. \n\nSimilarly, s=85:\n\na=85*84 /210 = (85*84)/(210)= (85*84)/(210)=85*(84/210)=85*(2/5)=34. \n\nThus a=34, c=85-34=51. \n\nThen n=34*211 +51=34*(200+11)+51=34*200 +34*11 +51=6800+374 +51=6800+425=7225. \n\nWhich is 85\u00b2=7225. \n\nDigits 34 and51 are valid since they are less than 211. \n\nTherefore, all these examples work. \n\nTherefore, I think my conclusion is correct. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{211}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the least integer \\( b \\geq 2 \\) such that there are more than ten \\( b \\)-eautiful integers.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, we need to find the smallest base b (where b is at least 2) such that there are more than ten b-eautiful numbers. A b-eautiful number is a two-digit number in base b, and the sum of its digits equals the square root of the number itself. \n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the definition correctly. A two-digit number in base b would be represented as \"d1 d2\" where d1 is the first digit (the coefficient of b^1) and d2 is the second digit (the coefficient of b^0). So, the actual value of the number in decimal is d1*b + d2. The condition is that the sum of these two digits, d1 + d2, must equal the square root of the number, which is sqrt(d1*b + d2). \n\nThe example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). That makes sense.\n\nSo, our task is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's formalize the problem. Let n be a b-eautiful number. Then:\n\nn = d1 * b + d2, where d1 and d2 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 must be between 1 and b-1 (since leading zeros aren't allowed), and d2 must be between 0 and b-1. \n\nThe condition is that d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). Since sqrt(n) must be an integer (because the sum of digits is an integer), n must be a perfect square. So, n = k^2 for some integer k. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nd1 + d2 = k, and n = k^2 = d1*b + d2.\n\nSo substituting the second equation into the first, we get:\n\nd1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2). But since n = k^2, then sqrt(n) = k, so indeed, d1 + d2 = k.\n\nTherefore, combining the two equations, we can write:\n\nd1 + d2 = k,\n\nand\n\nd1*b + d2 = k^2.\n\nSo, substituting d2 from the first equation into the second, we get:\n\nd1*b + (k - d1) = k^2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nd1*b + k - d1 = k^2,\n\nd1*(b - 1) + k = k^2,\n\nThen,\n\nd1*(b - 1) = k^2 - k,\n\nThus,\n\nd1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1).\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1 (since it's a digit in base b), the right-hand side must also be an integer in that interval. Similarly, d2 = k - d1 must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo, for given b, we can look for integers k such that (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and then compute d1 and check the constraints on d1 and d2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of k and b. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can reorganize the equations. Let me see:\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) d1 + d2 = k,\n\n2) d1*b + d2 = k^2.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\nd1*b + d2 - (d1 + d2) = k^2 - k,\n\nd1*(b - 1) = k(k - 1),\n\nSo,\n\nd1 = [k(k - 1)] / (b - 1).\n\nSo, since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b - 1, inclusive, this gives us constraints on k and b.\n\nAdditionally, since d2 = k - d1, then d2 must be between 0 and b - 1. Since d1 is at least 1, d2 can be as low as k - (b - 1), but since d2 must be non-negative, that requires k - d1 >= 0, so d1 <= k. Since d1 = [k(k - 1)]/(b -1), then [k(k -1)]/(b -1) <= k, so (k -1)/(b -1) <=1, so (k -1) <= (b -1). Therefore, k <= b. Hmm, that's an important point.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom d1 <= b -1 (since it's a digit), and d1 = [k(k -1)]/(b -1). Therefore,\n\n[k(k -1)]/(b -1) <= b -1,\n\nso k(k -1) <= (b -1)^2,\n\nand also, since d1 must be at least 1,\n\n[k(k -1)]/(b -1) >= 1,\n\nso k(k -1) >= (b -1).\n\nAdditionally, since d2 = k - d1 must be between 0 and b-1,\n\nd2 = k - [k(k -1)/(b -1)] >= 0,\n\nso,\n\nk - [k(k -1)/(b -1)] >= 0,\n\nMultiply both sides by (b -1):\n\nk(b -1) - k(k -1) >=0,\n\nk [ (b -1) - (k -1) ] >=0,\n\nk (b -1 -k +1 ) >=0,\n\nk (b -k) >=0,\n\nSince k is positive (as a digit sum), and b is at least 2, this implies that (b -k) >=0, so k <= b.\n\nWait, so from this inequality, we have that k must be <= b.\n\nAlso, from the d2 <= b -1,\n\nd2 = k - d1,\n\n= k - [k(k -1)/(b -1)].\n\nThis must be <= b -1,\n\nSo,\n\nk - [k(k -1)/(b -1)] <= b -1,\n\nMultiply both sides by (b -1):\n\nk(b -1) -k(k -1) <= (b -1)^2,\n\nAgain,\n\nk [ (b -1) - (k -1) ] <= (b -1)^2,\n\nk (b -k) <= (b -1)^2,\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to express this in terms of k and b. Since we need to find for each b, how many k's satisfy these conditions, leading to valid d1 and d2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of this as for each base b, the possible k's must satisfy that k(k -1) is divisible by (b -1), and then d1 is [k(k -1)]/(b-1), and then d2 =k -d1 must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers k where:\n\n1. 1 <= d1 = [k(k -1)]/(b -1) <= b -1,\n\n2. 0 <= d2 = k - d1 <= b -1,\n\n3. k is a positive integer such that k^2 = n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b = b in decimal) and b^2 -1 (the largest two-digit number is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 -1).\n\nWait, actually, the two-digit numbers in base b range from b (10_b) up to b^2 -1 ( (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 -1). Therefore, n must satisfy b <= n <= b^2 -1. Since n = k^2, that gives:\n\nsqrt(b) <= k <= sqrt(b^2 -1).\n\nBut sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so actually k can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, since k must be an integer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nsqrt(b^2 -1) is slightly less than b, so the maximum k would be floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)), which is b -1, since (b-1)^2 is (b\u00b2 - 2b +1) which is less than b\u00b2 -1 when b >=2.\n\nWait, actually, (b -1)^2 = b\u00b2 -2b +1, so for b >=2, b\u00b2 -2b +1 < b\u00b2 -1, since -2b +1 < -1 when b >=1. Therefore, (b-1)^2 < b\u00b2 -1. So the maximum k is floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)), which is b -1. So the possible k's are integers from 2 up to b-1? Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the minimal n is b, so the minimal k is sqrt(b). Since k must be integer, so k starts from ceiling(sqrt(b)). The maximum n is b\u00b2 -1, so maximum k is floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is less than b, the maximum k is b-1. Therefore, the possible k's are integers from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the possible k's are integers k where ceiling(sqrt(b)) <= k <= b-1, and such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and then the corresponding d1 and d2 must satisfy the digit constraints (d1 between 1 and b-1, d2 between 0 and b-1).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to, for each base b, count the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and also ensuring that d2 =k - [ (k^2 -k)/(b-1) ] is between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the divisibility condition is the main constraint here.\n\nSo, first, let me formalize:\n\nLet me denote m = b-1. Then, since b >=2, m >=1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nd1 = [k(k -1)] / m,\n\nand m = b-1,\n\nso we need m divides k(k-1).\n\nTherefore, for each m >=1 (i.e., b = m +1 >=2), the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] (since b = m+1, so the upper limit for k is b-1 = m) such that m divides k(k-1), and also d1 = k(k-1)/m must be between 1 and m (since d1 <= b-1 = m), and d2 =k - d1 must be between 0 and m (since d2 <= b-1 = m).\n\nWait, but since d1 must be at least 1, then k(k -1)/m >=1, so k(k-1) >= m.\n\nAlso, d1 <= m, so k(k-1)/m <= m, so k(k-1) <= m\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, for each m, the k's must satisfy:\n\nceil(sqrt(m+1)) <= k <= m,\n\nand\n\nk(k -1) \u2261 0 mod m,\n\nand\n\nk(k -1) >= m,\n\nand\n\nk(k -1) <= m\u00b2,\n\nand also d2 = k - [k(k -1)/m] must be between 0 and m.\n\nBut perhaps the main constraints are the divisibility and the bounds on k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of this as follows: For each m (i.e., each base b = m+1), we need to find the number of integers k between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m such that m divides k(k-1). Since m divides k(k-1), m must be a divisor of k(k-1). Since k and k-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, m must be a divisor that can be split into factors that divide k and k-1 respectively.\n\nTherefore, since gcd(k, k-1) =1, m must divide the product k(k-1), so m must be a product of two coprime numbers, one dividing k and the other dividing k-1. Therefore, the number of solutions k is equal to the number of divisors of m, but this might be a bit more involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, we can compute the number of k between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m such that m divides k(k-1). Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to compute for each base b, the number of such k's and find when this number exceeds 10.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps we can look for when the number of solutions k increases as b increases, and find the first b where the count is 11 or more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find an expression for the number of solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each m = b-1, the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides k(k-1). Let me note that since k and k-1 are coprime, m must divide either k or k-1, but since they are coprime, m must divide one of them, but not necessarily both. Wait, actually, if m divides the product of two coprime numbers, then m must be a product of a divisor of k and a divisor of (k-1). Since they are coprime, the divisors must be coprime. So m must be expressible as d1*d2 where d1 divides k and d2 divides (k-1), and d1 and d2 are coprime. But since m = d1*d2, then d1 and d2 must be coprime. So the number of solutions would be related to the number of ways to split m into such d1 and d2, but this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, the number of k's is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that k \u22610 mod d or k \u22611 mod d, where d divides m? Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since m divides k(k-1), then either m divides k or m divides (k-1), or m divides some combination. Wait, but since m divides the product of coprime numbers, m can be split into factors dividing each term. Since gcd(k, k-1)=1, then m must divide k or m divides (k-1). Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, if m is composite, say m=6, then 6 divides k(k-1). Suppose k=5, then 5*4=20, which 6 doesn't divide. Wait, maybe my previous thought was wrong.\n\nWait, actually, if m divides the product of two coprime numbers, then m can be written as m1*m2 where m1 divides k and m2 divides (k-1), and m1 and m2 are coprime. So the number of solutions would be equal to the number of ways to split m into coprime factors m1 and m2, then set k \u22610 mod m1 and k \u22611 mod m2. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that k \u22610 mod d or k\u22611 mod d for some divisors of m? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of trying to find a general formula, we can consider small values of m (i.e., small b) and see how the count grows, and then look for when it exceeds 10. Since the problem asks for the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, maybe we can iterate over b starting from 2 upwards, compute the number of b-eautiful numbers, and stop when we find the first b where the count is more than 10.\n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the minimal such b, perhaps this brute-force approach is feasible, especially since the answer is likely not too large (since the example given is base 13, which already has at least one such number, so maybe the required b is in the teens or low 20s?).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a smarter way.\n\nLet me try to formalize the count for a given m = b-1.\n\nLet\u2019s denote m = b -1, so b = m +1.\n\nWe need to find the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides k(k -1).\n\nLet\u2019s denote the condition as k(k -1) \u22610 mod m.\n\nWe can think of this as k \u22610 mod m or k \u22611 mod m, but that would only be the case if m divides k or m divides (k-1). But actually, since m divides the product, but k and k-1 are coprime, so m can have factors dividing either k or k-1, but not both. Therefore, for each divisor d of m, we can have k \u22610 mod d and k \u22611 mod (m/d). Hmm, this is getting into the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions to k(k -1) \u22610 mod m is equal to the number of solutions to k \u22610 mod d and k \u22611 mod (m/d) for each divisor d of m. But this might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, note that the equation k(k -1) \u22610 mod m is equivalent to k \u22610 mod m or k \u22611 mod m only if m is a prime power? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the number of solutions as multiplicative over the prime factors of m. Maybe using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but perhaps this is too involved.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each m, the number of k in [a, m], where a = ceil(sqrt(m+1)), such that m divides k(k-1). Let's think of possible k values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that k and k-1 are coprime, so m divides k(k-1) implies that m must divide into the product, but since they are coprime, m must be a factor that splits into factors dividing each term. Therefore, m must be expressible as m1*m2 where m1 divides k and m2 divides (k-1), and m1 and m2 are coprime.\n\nTherefore, for each such pair (m1, m2), the number of solutions would be the number of k \u22610 mod m1 and k \u22611 mod m2. But since m1 and m2 are coprime, by Chinese remainder theorem, there is a unique solution mod m. So each such pair gives exactly one solution in the range 1 to m. But since we are looking for k between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m, perhaps each pair contributes at most one solution.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions would be equal to the number of ways to factor m into coprime pairs (m1, m2), but this might be equal to 2^{number of prime factors of m}. Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions k in 1 to m is equal to the number of divisors of m? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's take a small m and compute the number of solutions manually.\n\nLet me try with m=12 (so b=13, as in the example). Then m=12, so b=13.\n\nWe need to find k between ceil(sqrt(13))=4 and 12, so k from 4 to 12, such that 12 divides k(k-1).\n\nLet me list k from 4 to 12 and check:\n\nk=4: 4*3=12 \u2192 12 divides 12 \u2192 yes. So that's one solution.\n\nk=5: 5*4=20 \u2192 20 mod12=8 \u2192 no.\n\nk=6:6*5=30 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\nk=7:7*6=42 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\nk=8:8*7=56 mod12=8 \u2192 no.\n\nk=9:9*8=72 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nk=10:10*9=90 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\nk=11:11*10=110 mod12=10 \u2192 no.\n\nk=12:12*11=132 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the solutions are k=4,9,12. But wait, in the example, 81 is 63 in base13, so k=9 (since sqrt(81)=9). The other solutions would be for k=4 and k=12.\n\nWait, let's check those:\n\nFor k=4:\n\nd1 = [4*3]/12 = 12/12=1.\n\nd2 =4 -1=3.\n\nSo the number is 1*13 +3=16. The digits are 1 and 3, sum to 4, sqrt(16)=4. So that's valid.\n\nFor k=12:\n\nd1 = [12*11]/12 =11. So d1=11, which is allowed in base13 (digits go up to 12). Then d2=12 -11=1.\n\nThus, the number is 11*13 +1=143 +1=144, which is 12\u00b2. The digits are 11 and 1, sum to 12, which is sqrt(144)=12. So that's valid.\n\nSo total of 3 solutions for m=12 (b=13). The example had one, but there are two more.\n\nWait, so in the problem statement, the example is just one of them. So in base13, there are three b-eautiful numbers: 16, 81, and 144? Wait, but 144 in base13 is 11*13 +1 = 144, so written as \"11 1\", so digits sum to 12, which is sqrt(144). So that works.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the example says 81 is 13-eautiful. So that's one of the three.\n\nTherefore, for m=12 (b=13), there are 3 such numbers. So the count is 3 here.\n\nSo maybe when m increases, the number of solutions increases. Let me try with a larger m. Let's try m=24 (so b=25). Let me see.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find a better way.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that for each m, the number of k's satisfying k(k-1) \u22610 mod m is equal to the number of solutions to k \u22610 mod d and k \u22611 mod (m/d) for each divisor d of m. But since d and m/d must be coprime (because d divides m and m/d divides m, but since k \u22610 mod d and k\u22611 mod (m/d), then gcd(d, m/d) must divide 1, so they must be coprime). Therefore, each such pair (d, m/d) where d divides m and gcd(d, m/d)=1 corresponds to a solution.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m such that gcd(d, m/d)=1. Since d and m/d are coprime, such divisors d are exactly the divisors of m that are coprime to m/d, but since d and m/d are coprime, this is equivalent to d being a divisor of m where d divides m and gcd(d, m/d)=1.\n\nAlternatively, since d and m/d are coprime, the number of such d is equal to 2^{number of prime factors of m}. Because for each prime in the prime factorization of m, we can choose whether to put it in d or in m/d, but since they have to be coprime, each prime can be in only one of them. Therefore, the number of such divisors d is 2^{\u03c9(m)}, where \u03c9(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me see with m=12. The prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3. So \u03c9(m)=2, so 2^2=4. But earlier, we found 3 solutions for m=12. Hmm, discrepancy here. Maybe my reasoning is off.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe divisors d of 12 where gcd(d, 12/d)=1:\n\nLet me list all divisors d of 12:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nCheck each d:\n\nd=1: gcd(1, 12/1)=gcd(1,12)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2, 6)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=3: gcd(3,4)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=4: gcd(4,3)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=6: gcd(6, 2)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=12: gcd(12,1)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nTherefore, the qualifying d's are 1,3,4,12. So four divisors. But when we computed for m=12, we had 3 solutions. Hmm, so perhaps each divisor corresponds to a solution, but some solutions may be outside the range [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m]. Let's see:\n\nEach divisor d gives a solution via the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let's compute the solutions for each d:\n\nFor each d in {1,3,4,12}:\n\nFor d=1:\n\nWe need k \u22610 mod1 (always true) and k\u22611 mod (12/1)=12. So k \u22611 mod12. The solution in 1 to 12 is k=1. But since our k must be at least ceil(sqrt(13))=4, so k=1 is too small. So this solution is outside the range.\n\nFor d=3:\n\nNeed k \u22610 mod3 and k\u22611 mod(12/3)=4.\n\nFind k \u22610 mod3 and k\u22611 mod4.\n\nSolutions mod 12:\n\nFind x \u22610 mod3,\n\nx\u22611 mod4.\n\nPossible x: Let's see:\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod4: 1,5,9,13,...\n\nLooking for one divisible by 3: 9 is 9 mod12. 9 mod4 is 1 (since 9-8=1). So k=9 mod12. So the solution is 9, which is within the range 4 to 12. So k=9.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nNeed k\u22610 mod4 and k\u22611 mod(12/4)=3.\n\nSo k \u22610 mod4 and k\u22611 mod3.\n\nFind x \u22610 mod4,\n\nx\u22611 mod3.\n\nPossible x: 4 mod4, so x=4,8,12,...\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n4 mod3=1 \u2192 4 mod3=1 \u2192 so 4 is solution. 4 mod3=1, so yes. 8 mod3=2, 12 mod3=0. So the solution is 4 mod12. Thus k=4, which is within the range.\n\nFor d=12:\n\nNeed k\u22610 mod12 and k\u22611 mod1 (since m/d=1). Since mod1 is always 0, but the condition is k\u22611 mod1, which is always true. So k\u22610 mod12. So k=12. Which is within the range.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are k=4,9,12. So three solutions, but there are four divisors. The divisor d=1 gives a solution k=1 which is below the minimum k=4, so it's excluded. Therefore, the total solutions within the range are 3, which matches our previous count.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] is equal to the number of divisors d of m with gcd(d, m/d)=1, minus those solutions where k is less than the lower bound (ceil(sqrt(m+1))).\n\nTherefore, in order to compute the number of solutions, we can:\n\n1. Find all divisors d of m where gcd(d, m/d)=1.\n\n2. For each such d, compute the solution k via Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), which is unique mod m, so in 1 to m there's exactly one solution.\n\n3. Count how many of these solutions k are in the interval [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m].\n\nThus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such d's minus those d's whose corresponding k is less than the lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lower bound is ceil(sqrt(m+1)), so for each solution k, we need to check if it's >= ceil(sqrt(m+1)).\n\nTherefore, the process is:\n\nFor each m (starting from b=2 upwards, so m from 1 upwards):\n\n- Enumerate all divisors d of m where gcd(d, m/d)=1.\n\n- For each such d, compute the solution k via CRT as above.\n\n- Count how many of those k's satisfy k >= ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and k <= m.\n\n- The count is the number of b-eautiful numbers for base b = m +1.\n\nWe need to find the smallest m (so the smallest b = m +1) where this count exceeds 10.\n\nThis seems manageable, but doing this for each m step by step might be tedious, but perhaps manageable with some pattern recognition or formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that the number of divisors d with gcd(d, m/d)=1 is 2^{\u03c9(m)}, where \u03c9(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m. Because for each prime factor, you can choose whether to put it into d or into m/d, so each prime gives a factor of 2, leading to 2^{\u03c9(m)}. However, in the case of m=12, which has \u03c9=2 (primes 2 and 3), 2^2=4, which matches the four divisors d=1,3,4,12. So that formula holds. However, in the case of m=6 (primes 2 and 3, \u03c9=2), divisors d with gcd(d, m/d)=1 would be:\n\nDivisors of 6:1,2,3,6.\n\nCheck each d:\n\nd=1: gcd(1,6)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2, 3)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=3: gcd(3,2)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=6: gcd(6,1)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo all four divisors. So 2^2=4, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the number of such d's is indeed 2^{\u03c9(m)}.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions k (without considering the lower bound) is 2^{\u03c9(m)}.\n\nHowever, some of these solutions may lie below the lower bound ceil(sqrt(m+1)), so we need to subtract those.\n\nThus, for each m, the number of b-eautiful numbers is:\n\nNumber of solutions = 2^{\u03c9(m)} - number of solutions k where k < ceil(sqrt(m +1)).\n\nTherefore, to compute this, we need to find for each m, how many of the solutions k (each corresponding to a divisor d) are below the lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lower bound is not too restrictive for large m. So if m is large enough, then the number of solutions is roughly 2^{\u03c9(m)}, so to get over 10, we need 2^{\u03c9(m)} > 10. So \u03c9(m) must be at least 4, since 2^4=16. However, this is only an approximation because some solutions may be below the lower bound. So maybe m needs to have at least 4 prime factors?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m with many prime factors would have more solutions. Let's try some examples.\n\nLet me try m=30 (so b=31). Then \u03c9(m)=3 (primes 2,3,5). So 2^3=8 solutions. Let's see:\n\nDivisors d of 30 where gcd(d, 30/d)=1:\n\nFirst, list all divisors of 30:\n\n1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.\n\nCheck which d's satisfy gcd(d,30/d)=1:\n\nd=1: gcd(1,30)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2,15)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=3: gcd(3,10)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=5: gcd(5,6)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=6: gcd(6,5)=1? gcd(6,5)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, d=6 divides 30, so 30/d=5. gcd(6,5)=1. Yes.\n\nWait, but 6 and 5 are coprime. Wait, but 6 is 2*3, and 5 is prime. So yes.\n\nWait, but 6 is a divisor of 30, so 30/d=5. gcd(6,5)=1.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nd=10: gcd(10,3)=1? gcd(10,3)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=15: gcd(15,2)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=30: gcd(30,1)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, so all divisors of 30 qualify? Wait, but 6 and 30/d=5, yes. Wait, but 6 is 2*3, and 5 is coprime. Similarly, 10 is 2*5, and 30/10=3, which is coprime to 10? gcd(10,3)=1. So yes. So all divisors of 30 satisfy gcd(d, m/d)=1? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check:\n\nTake d=6 and m/d=5, so gcd(6,5)=1.\n\nd=10: m/d=3, gcd(10,3)=1.\n\nd=15: m/d=2, gcd(15,2)=1.\n\nd=30: m/d=1, gcd(30,1)=1.\n\nSo indeed, all divisors of 30 satisfy the condition. Therefore, there are 8 solutions. Let's see the solutions:\n\nFor each d, compute k via CRT.\n\nStarting with d=1:\n\nk \u22610 mod1 (always true), and k\u22611 mod30. So k=1 mod30. Within 1-30, the solution is k=1. But the lower bound is ceil(sqrt(31))\u22485.58, so 6. So k=1 is too small.\n\nd=2:\n\nk \u22610 mod2, and k\u22611 mod15 (since m/d=30/2=15).\n\nFind k \u22610 mod2 and k\u22611 mod15.\n\nFind x \u22611 mod15, even.\n\nNumbers congruent to 1 mod15: 1,16,31,... The even one is 16 mod30. So k=16.\n\nCheck 16 mod2=0, 16 mod15=1. Yes. So k=16 is in the range [6,30].\n\nd=3:\n\nk \u22610 mod3, k\u22611 mod10 (since m/d=30/3=10).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod3 and x\u22611 mod10.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod10: 1,11,21,31,...\n\nCheck divisibility by 3: 1 mod3=1, 11 mod3=2, 21 mod3=0 \u2192 21. So k=21 mod30. So k=21, which is within [6,30].\n\nd=5:\n\nk\u22610 mod5, k\u22611 mod6 (since m/d=30/5=6).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod5 and x\u22611 mod6.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod6:1,7,13,19,25,31,...\n\nCheck divisibility by5:\n\n25 mod5=0 \u2192 25. So k=25 mod30. So k=25 is within range.\n\nd=6:\n\nk\u22610 mod6, k\u22611 mod5 (since m/d=30/6=5).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod6 and x\u22611 mod5.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod5:1,6,11,16,21,26,31,...\n\nCheck divisible by6: 6 mod5=1 \u2192 6 mod5=1? Wait, 6 mod5=1, yes. So 6 mod5=1, so 6 is a solution. So k=6 mod30. So k=6 is within the range (since 6 is the lower bound). So k=6.\n\nd=10:\n\nk\u22610 mod10, k\u22611 mod3 (since m/d=30/10=3).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod10 and x\u22611 mod3.\n\nNumbers divisible by10:10,20,30,...\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n10 mod3=1 \u2192 yes. So k=10 mod30. 10 is within range.\n\nd=15:\n\nk\u22610 mod15, k\u22611 mod2 (since m/d=30/15=2).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod15 and x\u22611 mod2.\n\nNumbers divisible by15:15,30,...\n\nCheck mod2: 15 mod2=1, so 15 is a solution. So k=15 mod30. 15 is within range.\n\nd=30:\n\nk\u22610 mod30, k\u22611 mod1 (always true). So k=30 mod30. k=30 is within the range.\n\nNow, compiling all solutions:\n\nFrom the divisors:\n\nd=1: k=1 (too small)\n\nd=2: k=16\n\nd=3: k=21\n\nd=5: k=25\n\nd=6: k=6\n\nd=10: k=10\n\nd=15: k=15\n\nd=30: k=30\n\nSo total solutions within the range are 7 (excluding k=1). So total of 7 solutions for m=30 (b=31). Hmm, but 2^3=8, but one solution was too small. So the count is 7.\n\nTherefore, the formula is 2^{\u03c9(m)} minus the number of solutions below the lower bound.\n\nHmm, so maybe for m with more prime factors, the number of solutions increases, but some may be excluded.\n\nWait, let's try m=60 (b=61). \u03c9(m)=4 (primes 2,3,5). So 2^4=16 solutions. Let's see how many are above the lower bound.\n\nFirst, compute the lower bound: sqrt(61)\u22487.81, so ceil(7.81)=8.\n\nSo k must be between 8 and 60.\n\nThe number of solutions would be 16 minus the number of solutions less than 8.\n\nBut enumerating all solutions would take time. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is roughly doubling each time we add a prime factor, so m with \u03c9=4 might have 16 solutions, but some might be below the lower bound. If the lower bound is not too high, maybe 16 - something small.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m=60 would give us 16 solutions, minus some number, but maybe it's over 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can try m=24 (b=25). Let's see.\n\nm=24 (b=25). \u03c9(m)=2 (primes 2,3). So 2^2=4 solutions, but need to check.\n\nWait, first, divisors d of 24 with gcd(d,24/d)=1.\n\nDivisors of 24: 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24.\n\nCheck which d's satisfy gcd(d,24/d)=1.\n\nd=1: gcd(1,24)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2,12)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=3: gcd(3,8)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=4: gcd(4,6)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=6: gcd(6,4)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=8: gcd(8,3)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=12: gcd(12,2)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=24: gcd(24,1)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus qualifying d's:1,3,8,24.\n\nSo four solutions.\n\nNow compute the solutions:\n\nFor each d:\n\nd=1:\n\nk\u22610 mod1 (always) and k\u22611 mod24 \u2192 k=1 mod24. k=1 is below ceil(sqrt(25))=5. So excluded.\n\nd=3:\n\nk\u22610 mod3, k\u22611 mod8 (since 24/3=8).\n\nFind x \u22610 mod3 and x\u22611 mod8.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod8:1,9,17,25,...\n\nCheck mod3: 1 mod3=1, 9 mod3=0 \u2192 9. So k=9 mod24. So k=9 is within [5,24].\n\nd=8:\n\nk\u22610 mod8, k\u22611 mod3 (since 24/8=3).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod8 and x\u22611 mod3.\n\nNumbers divisible by8:8,16,24,...\n\nCheck mod3: 8 mod3=2, 16 mod3=1 \u219216 mod3=1. So k=16 mod24. 16 is within range.\n\nd=24:\n\nk\u22610 mod24 and k\u22611 mod1 \u2192 k=24 mod24. So k=24, which is within [5,24].\n\nThus, the solutions are k=9,16,24. The d=1 solution (k=1) is excluded. So total of 3 solutions for m=24 (b=25).\n\nHmm, so even with \u03c9=2, it's 4 solutions minus 1, giving 3. Not enough.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look for m with higher \u03c9(m). Let's try m=60 (b=61). \u03c9=4.\n\nBut to compute this manually would be time-consuming, so perhaps I can think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal m where the number of solutions exceeds 10 is when 2^{\u03c9(m)} exceeds 10, but with some solutions not excluded. Since 2^4=16, so if \u03c9(m)>=4, then 16 solutions. If the lower bound excludes, say, 5 solutions, then 11 left. So maybe m with \u03c9=4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m=30 (which had \u03c9=3 and gave 7 solutions), m=60 (\u03c9=4, maybe 16 solutions minus some). Let me see if m=60 gives enough.\n\nLet me try to compute for m=60 (b=61):\n\nLower bound is ceil(sqrt(61))\u22487.81 \u2192 8.\n\nSo k must be between 8 and 60.\n\nDivisors d of 60 with gcd(d,60/d)=1.\n\nFirst, prime factors of 60 are 2,3,5 (so \u03c9=3). Wait, no, 60 factors into 2^2*3*5, so \u03c9=3. Wait, so 2^{3}=8 solutions? Wait, but earlier thought was m=60 has \u03c9=4? Wait no, m=60 is 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00d75, so three distinct primes. So \u03c9=3. So 2^3=8 solutions? But that contradicts earlier thought that m=60 would have \u03c9=4. Wait, my mistake earlier, m=60 is 2\u00d73\u00d75, so \u03c9=3. So 2^3=8 solutions. Hmm.\n\nWait, so let's recast:\n\nWait m=60. Let's compute the divisors d with gcd(d,60/d)=1.\n\nFirst, list all divisors of 60:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60.\n\nNow check each d:\n\nd=1: gcd(1,60)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2,30)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=3: gcd(3,20)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=4: gcd(4,15)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=5: gcd(5,12)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=6: gcd(6,10)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=10: gcd(10,6)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=12: gcd(12,5)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=15: gcd(15,4)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=20: gcd(20,3)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=30: gcd(30,2)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=60: gcd(60,1)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo qualifying d's: 1,3,4,5,12,15,20,60. Total of 8 divisors (2^3=8).\n\nNow compute the solutions for each d:\n\nd=1:\n\nk \u22610 mod1 (always true), k\u22611 mod60. So k=1 mod60. Since lower bound is 8, k=1 is excluded.\n\nd=3:\n\nk \u22610 mod3, k\u22611 mod20 (since 60/3=20).\n\nFind x \u22610 mod3 and x\u22611 mod20.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod20:1,21,41,61,...\n\nCheck mod3: 1 mod3=1, 21 mod3=0 \u2192 21. So k=21 mod60. 21 is within [8,60].\n\nd=4:\n\nk \u22610 mod4, k\u22611 mod15 (since 60/4=15).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod4 and x\u22611 mod15.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod15:1,16,31,46,61,...\n\nCheck mod4: 1 mod4=1, 16 mod4=0 \u219216. So k=16 mod60. 16 is within range.\n\nd=5:\n\nk \u22610 mod5, k\u22611 mod12 (since 60/5=12).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod5 and x\u22611 mod12.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod12:1,13,25,37,49,61,...\n\nCheck mod5: 25 mod5=0 \u219225. So k=25 mod60. Within range.\n\nd=12:\n\nk \u22610 mod12, k\u22611 mod5 (since 60/12=5).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod12 and x\u22611 mod5.\n\nNumbers divisible by12:12,24,36,48,60,...\n\nCheck mod5:\n\n12 mod5=2,\n\n24 mod5=4,\n\n36 mod5=1 \u219236 mod5=1. So k=36 mod60. 36 is within range.\n\nd=15:\n\nk\u22610 mod15, k\u22611 mod4 (since 60/15=4).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod15 and x\u22611 mod4.\n\nNumbers divisible by15:15,30,45,60,...\n\nCheck mod4:\n\n15 mod4=3,\n\n30 mod4=2,\n\n45 mod4=1 \u219245 mod4=1. So k=45 mod60. 45 is within range.\n\nd=20:\n\nk\u22610 mod20, k\u22611 mod3 (since 60/20=3).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod20 and x\u22611 mod3.\n\nNumbers divisible by20:20,40,60,...\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n20 mod3=2,\n\n40 mod3=1 \u219240 mod3=1. So k=40 mod60. 40 is within range.\n\nd=60:\n\nk\u22610 mod60, k\u22611 mod1 \u2192 k=60 mod60. So k=60, which is within [8,60].\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\nFrom d=1: k=1 (excluded)\n\nd=3:21,\n\nd=4:16,\n\nd=5:25,\n\nd=12:36,\n\nd=15:45,\n\nd=20:40,\n\nd=60:60.\n\nTotal solutions:7 (since 8 divisors minus 1 excluded). Wait, but 2^3=8 solutions total, but one is below the lower bound (k=1). So total of 7 solutions for m=60 (b=61).\n\nHmm, still not enough. Let's try m=210 (b=211). \u03c9(m)=4 (primes 2,3,5,7). So 2^4=16 solutions. Let's see:\n\nFirst, the lower bound is ceil(sqrt(211))\u224814.5, so 15.\n\nSo k must be between 15 and 210.\n\nDivisors d of 210 where gcd(d,210/d)=1.\n\n210 factors into 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77, so \u03c9=4.\n\nThe divisors d would be products of subsets of the prime factors. Since each prime must be entirely in d or in 210/d, so each divisor d is a product of some subset of the prime factors, and the remaining primes are in 210/d. So total of 2^4=16 divisors.\n\nEach such divisor d will correspond to a solution k.\n\nHowever, many of these solutions might be below 15. Let's see:\n\nTake d=1: solution k=1 mod210 \u2192 k=1, too small.\n\nd=2: gcd(2,105)=1? 210/2=105. gcd(2,105)=1? 105 is divisible by 3,5,7. gcd(2,105)=1 \u2192 yes. So d=2 is allowed.\n\nWait, but in general, for each d which is a product of a subset of the prime factors, the solution k will be:\n\nk \u22610 mod d,\n\nk\u22611 mod (210/d).\n\nSo for each d, the solution is unique mod210. Let's see a few examples:\n\nd=2:\n\nk \u22610 mod2,\n\nk\u22611 mod105.\n\nFind x\u22611 mod105 and even.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod105: 1,106,211,...\n\nEven number is 106 mod210. So k=106. Which is within 15-210.\n\nd=3:\n\nk\u22610 mod3,\n\nk\u22611 mod70 (210/3=70).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod70 and divisible by3.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod70:1,71,141,211,...\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n1 mod3=1,\n\n71 mod3= 71-69=2 \u2192 mod3=2,\n\n141 mod3=0 \u2192141. So k=141 mod210. Within range.\n\nd=5:\n\nk\u22610 mod5,\n\nk\u22611 mod42 (210/5=42).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod42 divisible by5.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod42:1,43,85,127,169,211,...\n\nCheck mod5:\n\n1 mod5=1,\n\n43 mod5=3,\n\n85 mod5=0 \u219285. So k=85 mod210. 85 is within range.\n\nd=7:\n\nk\u22610 mod7,\n\nk\u22611 mod30 (210/7=30).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod30 divisible by7.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod30:1,31,61,91,121,151,181,211,...\n\nCheck mod7:\n\n1 mod7=1,\n\n31 mod7=3,\n\n61 mod7=5,\n\n91 mod7=0 \u219291. So k=91 mod210. Within range.\n\nd=2\u00d73=6:\n\nk\u22610 mod6,\n\nk\u22611 mod35 (210/(6)=35).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod35 divisible by6.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod35:1,36,71,106,141,176,211,...\n\nCheck mod6:\n\n1 mod6=1,\n\n36 mod6=0 \u219236. So k=36 mod210. 36 is within 15-210.\n\nd=2\u00d75=10:\n\nk\u22610 mod10,\n\nk\u22611 mod21 (210/10=21).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod21 divisible by10.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod21:1,22,43,64,85,106,127,148,169,190,211,...\n\nCheck mod10:\n\n1 mod10=1,\n\n22 mod10=2,\n\n43 mod10=3,\n\n64 mod10=4,\n\n85 mod10=5,\n\n106 mod10=6,\n\n127 mod10=7,\n\n148 mod10=8,\n\n169 mod10=9,\n\n190 mod10=0 \u2192190 mod10=0. So k=190 mod210. 190 is within range.\n\nd=2\u00d77=14:\n\nk\u22610 mod14,\n\nk\u22611 mod15 (210/14=15).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod15 divisible by14.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod15:1,16,31,46,61,76,91,106,121,136,151,166,181,196,211,...\n\nCheck mod14:\n\n1 mod14=1,\n\n16 mod14=2,\n\n31 mod14=3,\n\n46 mod14=4,\n\n61 mod14=5,\n\n76 mod14=8,\n\n91 mod14=7,\n\n106 mod14= 106-7*14=106-98=8,\n\nWait, let me compute properly:\n\n1 mod14=1,\n\n16 mod14=2,\n\n31 mod14=3,\n\n46 mod14=4,\n\n61 mod14=61-4*14=61-56=5,\n\n76 mod14=76-5*14=76-70=6,\n\n91 mod14=0 \u219291 is divisible by14 (14\u00d76.5? Wait, no: 14\u00d76=84, 14\u00d77=98. So 91 is 13\u00d77, so not divisible by14. Wait 91=13\u00d77. Hmm. So 91 mod14=91-6*14=91-84=7.\n\nWait, I need to find x \u22611 mod15 and divisible by14.\n\nLet me try 1 mod15:\n\nFirst number divisible by14 is 14\u00d7k \u22611 mod15.\n\n14k \u22611 mod15 \u2192 -k\u22611 mod15 \u2192k\u2261-1 mod15 \u2192k=14 mod15.\n\nThus, k=14 mod15. So the smallest such number is 14\u00d714=196?\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute:\n\nFind x=14m such that 14m \u22611 mod15.\n\n14m \u22611 mod15 \u2192 -m \u22611 mod15 \u2192m \u2261-1 mod15 \u2192m=14 mod15.\n\nThus, m=14 gives x=14\u00d714=196.\n\nNext m=29 gives x=14\u00d729=406 which is over 210.\n\nSo x=196 mod210. 196 is within range.\n\nd=3\u00d75=15:\n\nk\u22610 mod15,\n\nk\u22611 mod14 (210/15=14).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod14 divisible by15.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod14:1,15,29,43,57,71,85,99,113,127,141,155,169,183,197,211,...\n\nCheck mod15:\n\n1 mod15=1,\n\n15 mod15=0 \u219215.

Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, to have gcd(d, 180/d)=1, d must be a product of some subset of the primes 2,3,5, and the remaining primes in 180/d must be the complement. Since the exponents don't matter for coprimality.\n\nSo the qualifying divisors are the products of subsets of {2,3,5}:\n\nPossible subsets:\n\n- Empty set: d=1.\n\n- {2}: d=2.\n\n- {3}: d=3.\n\n- {5}: d=5.\n\n- {2,3}: d=6.\n\n- {2,5}: d=10.\n\n- {3,5}: d=15.\n\n- {2,3,5}: d=30.\n\nThus, these 8 divisors qualify. Let's confirm:\n\nFor example, d=2: gcd(2, 90)=gcd(2, 3\u00b2\u00d75)=2 \u22601 \u2192 no. Wait, this contradicts my previous thought.\n\nWait, my mistake. The factors must include the exponents. Since 180 has 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75, so d can have any combination of the primes 2,3,5 with exponents, but for gcd(d, 180/d)=1, the primes in d and 180/d must be disjoint.\n\nThus, d can only have primes from 2,3,5, but not both in d and in 180/d. So for example, d can't have 2 and 3, because 180/d would still have 2 or 3 if d has some exponents.\n\nWait, actually, the exact exponents might not matter. For example, if d has 2^a, then 180/d has 2^(2\u2212a). To have gcd(d, 180/d)=1, the exponents must be such that d and 180/d share no common prime factors. Which would require that for each prime, d contains all the exponent of that prime in 180, or none. \n\nThus, for each prime p in {2,3,5}, either all the exponents of p in 180 are in d or none.\n\nSince 180 has 2\u00b2,3\u00b2,5\u00b9.\n\nThus, for prime 2: either include all 2\u00b2 in d or none.\n\nSimilarly, for prime3: all 3\u00b2 or none.\n\nFor prime5: all 5\u00b9 or none.\n\nThus, the qualifying divisors are products of these choices:\n\nFor each prime:\n\n- Include all of 2\u00b2 or not.\n\n- Include all of 3\u00b2 or not.\n\n- Include all of 5\u00b9 or not.\n\nThus, the number of such divisors is 2\u00d72\u00d72=8.\n\nThese divisors are:\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75\u00b9 (180),\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2 (36),\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d75 (20),\n\n- 3\u00b2\u00d75 (45),\n\n- 2\u00b2 (4),\n\n- 3\u00b2 (9),\n\n- 5 (5),\n\n- 1 (1).\n\nThus the qualifying divisors are 1,4,5,9,20,36,45,180.\n\nWait this is different from my previous thought. So I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nThus, let's recast:\n\nQualifying divisors are those that are products of the entire prime power components.\n\nSo divisors are:\n\n- 1 (no primes),\n\n- 2\u00b2=4,\n\n- 3\u00b2=9,\n\n- 5,\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2=36,\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d75=20,\n\n- 3\u00b2\u00d75=45,\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75=180.\n\nSo these 8 divisors.\n\nNow compute solutions:\n\nd=1:\n\nk\u22611 mod180 \u2192k=1, excluded.\n\nd=4:\n\nk\u22610 mod4, k\u22611 mod45 (180/4=45).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod45 divisible by4.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod45:1,46,91,136,181,...\n\nCheck divisible by4:\n\n46 mod4=2,\n\n91 mod4=3,\n\n136 mod4=0 \u2192136 mod180=136.

Still 7.\n\nHmm, so it seems that until m=210, which has \u03c9=4, we can't get more than 15 solutions. Since the first m with \u03c9=4 is 210, which gives 15 solutions, which is the first time it exceeds 10.\n\nWait, let me check m= 105 (b=106) had 7 solutions, m= 210 (b=211) has 15.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the least integer b\u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\n\nThus, m=210 corresponds to b=211, which is the first base where the count exceeds 10.\n\nBut let me check if there is a smaller m with \u03c9=4. The minimal m with 4 distinct primes is 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210. So there is no smaller m with \u03c9=4. Thus, m=210 is indeed the first.\n\nHence, the answer is 211.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with m= 210, which is b=211, giving 15 solutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe m= 105 (b=106) with \u03c9=3, but no, it had 7.\n\nWait, maybe m= 60 (b=61) with \u03c9=3 gives 7 solutions. So indeed, the first m with \u03c9=4 is 210, giving 15 solutions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal base is 211. However, let me check m= 210's calculation again to be sure.\n\nEarlier, for m=210, we found 15 solutions. Let me recount the solutions listed:\n\nFrom the earlier list:\n\n106,141,85,91,36,190,196,15,21,175,120,126,70,105,210.\n\nWait that's 15 numbers. Each of these k's gives a valid two-digit number in base b=211. Each has digits d1 and d2 where d1 + d2 =k and d1*b + d2 =k\u00b2.\n\nYes. So indeed, there are 15 such numbers.\n\nThus, the minimal b is 211. However, the problem says \"more than ten\", so 11 or more. 15 is more than ten, so 211 is the first such base.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check m= 120 (b=121) had 7, m= 168 (b=169) had7, m= 180 had7, m= 210 is the first with 15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a m with \u03c9=4 but less than 210? Wait, no, since 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210 is the minimal with four distinct primes.\n\nThus, the minimal b is 211. But let me check another m with \u03c9=4 but with exponents. Wait, no, \u03c9 counts distinct primes, so exponents don't matter. Thus, 210 is the first.\n\nWait, but let me check m= 105\u00d72=210, so indeed.\n\nWait, perhaps m= 84 (b=85) with \u03c9=3 gives 7, m= 90 (b=91). Let's try m= 90 (b=91). \u03c9=3 (2,3,5). So 8 solutions.\n\nDivisors d of 90 (2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75) with gcd(d,90/d)=1.\n\nQualifying divisors are products of subsets of primes 2,3,5 with all exponents:\n\nThus:\n\n1,\n\n2,\n\n3,\n\n5,\n\n2\u00d73=6,\n\n2\u00d75=10,\n\n3\u00d75=15,\n\n2\u00d73\u00d75=30.\n\nWait, but need to include all exponents for each prime.\n\nFor example, for prime3, since it has exponent2 in 90, to have gcd(d,90/d)=1, if we include 3\u00b2 in d, then 90/d won't have any 3s. So the divisors are:\n\n- 2^1 (since 2^1 is the full exponent of 2 in 90),\n\n- 3^2 (full exponent of3),\n\n-5^1,\n\nand their products.\n\nThus, the qualifying divisors are:\n\n1,\n\n2,\n\n3\u00b2=9,\n\n5,\n\n2\u00d73\u00b2=18,\n\n2\u00d75=10,\n\n3\u00b2\u00d75=45,\n\n2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75=90.\n\nSo these 8 divisors.\n\nSolutions:\n\nd=1: k=1 mod90 \u2192excluded.\n\nd=2:\n\nk\u22610 mod2, k\u22611 mod45 (90/2=45).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod45 divisible by2 \u219246 mod90=46.

The condition is that the sum of these two digits, d1 + d2, must equal the square root of the number, which is sqrt(d1*b + d2). \n\nThe example given is 81 being 13-eautiful because in base 13, 81 is written as 63 (since 6*13 + 3 = 81), and 6 + 3 = 9, which is sqrt(81). That makes sense.\n\nSo, our task is to find the smallest base b where there are more than ten such numbers. Let's think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's formalize the problem. Let n be a b-eautiful number. Then:\n\nn = d1 * b + d2, where d1 and d2 are digits in base b. Since it's a two-digit number, d1 must be between 1 and b-1 (since leading zeros aren't allowed), and d2 must be between 0 and b-1. \n\nThe condition is that d1 + d2 = sqrt(n). Since sqrt(n) must be an integer (because the sum of digits is an integer), n must be a perfect square. So, n = k^2 for some integer k. Therefore, the equation becomes:\n\nd1 + d2 = k, and n = k^2 = d1*b + d2.\n\nSo substituting the second equation into the first, we get:\n\nd1 + d2 = sqrt(d1*b + d2). But since n = k^2, then sqrt(n) = k, so indeed, d1 + d2 = k.\n\nTherefore, combining the two equations, we can write:\n\nd1 + d2 = k,\n\nand\n\nd1*b + d2 = k^2.\n\nSo, substituting d2 from the first equation into the second, we get:\n\nd1*b + (k - d1) = k^2.\n\nSimplify that:\n\nd1*b + k - d1 = k^2,\n\nd1*(b - 1) + k = k^2,\n\nThen,\n\nd1*(b - 1) = k^2 - k,\n\nThus,\n\nd1 = (k^2 - k)/(b - 1).\n\nSince d1 must be an integer between 1 and b-1 (since it's a digit in base b), the right-hand side must also be an integer in that interval. Similarly, d2 = k - d1 must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nSo, for given b, we can look for integers k such that (k^2 - k) is divisible by (b - 1), and then compute d1 and check the constraints on d1 and d2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to express this in terms of k and b. Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can reorganize the equations. Let me see:\n\nWe have two equations:\n\n1) d1 + d2 = k,\n\n2) d1*b + d2 = k^2.\n\nSubtracting equation 1 from equation 2:\n\nd1*b + d2 - (d1 + d2) = k^2 - k,\n\nd1*(b - 1) = k(k - 1),\n\nSo,\n\nd1 = [k(k - 1)] / (b - 1).\n\nSo, since d1 must be an integer between 1 and b - 1, inclusive, this gives us constraints on k and b.\n\nAdditionally, since d2 = k - d1, then d2 must be between 0 and b - 1. Since d1 is at least 1, d2 can be as low as k - (b - 1), but since d2 must be non-negative, that requires k - d1 >= 0, so d1 <= k. Since d1 = [k(k - 1)]/(b -1), then [k(k -1)]/(b -1) <= k, so (k -1)/(b -1) <=1, so (k -1) <= (b -1). Therefore, k <= b. Hmm, that's an important point.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nFrom d1 <= b -1 (since it's a digit), and d1 = [k(k -1)]/(b -1). Therefore,\n\n[k(k -1)]/(b -1) <= b -1,\n\nso k(k -1) <= (b -1)^2,\n\nand also, since d1 must be at least 1,\n\n[k(k -1)]/(b -1) >= 1,\n\nso k(k -1) >= (b -1).\n\nAdditionally, since d2 = k - d1 must be between 0 and b-1,\n\nd2 = k - [k(k -1)/(b -1)] >= 0,\n\nso,\n\nk - [k(k -1)/(b -1)] >= 0,\n\nMultiply both sides by (b -1):\n\nk(b -1) - k(k -1) >=0,\n\nk [ (b -1) - (k -1) ] >=0,\n\nk (b -1 -k +1 ) >=0,\n\nk (b -k) >=0,\n\nSince k is positive (as a digit sum), and b is at least 2, this implies that (b -k) >=0, so k <= b.\n\nWait, so from this inequality, we have that k must be <= b.\n\nAlso, from the d2 <= b -1,\n\nd2 = k - d1,\n\n= k - [k(k -1)/(b -1)].\n\nThis must be <= b -1,\n\nSo,\n\nk - [k(k -1)/(b -1)] <= b -1,\n\nMultiply both sides by (b -1):\n\nk(b -1) -k(k -1) <= (b -1)^2,\n\nAgain,\n\nk [ (b -1) - (k -1) ] <= (b -1)^2,\n\nk (b -k) <= (b -1)^2,\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps immediately.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the key is to express this in terms of k and b. Since we need to find for each b, how many k's satisfy these conditions, leading to valid d1 and d2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of this as for each base b, the possible k's must satisfy that k(k -1) is divisible by (b -1), and then d1 is [k(k -1)]/(b-1), and then d2 =k -d1 must be between 0 and b-1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the number of b-eautiful numbers is equal to the number of integers k where:\n\n1. 1 <= d1 = [k(k -1)]/(b -1) <= b -1,\n\n2. 0 <= d2 = k - d1 <= b -1,\n\n3. k is a positive integer such that k^2 = n is a two-digit number in base b, so n must be between b (the smallest two-digit number in base b is 10_b = b in decimal) and b^2 -1 (the largest two-digit number is (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 -1).\n\nWait, actually, the two-digit numbers in base b range from b (10_b) up to b^2 -1 ( (b-1)(b) + (b-1) = b^2 -1). Therefore, n must satisfy b <= n <= b^2 -1. Since n = k^2, that gives:\n\nsqrt(b) <= k <= sqrt(b^2 -1).\n\nBut sqrt(b^2 -1) is less than b, so actually k can be from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b-1, since k must be an integer.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nsqrt(b^2 -1) is slightly less than b, so the maximum k would be floor(sqrt(b^2 -1)), which is b -1, since (b-1)^2 is (b\u00b2 - 2b +1) which is less than b\u00b2 -1 when b >=2.\n\nWait, actually, (b -1)^2 = b\u00b2 -2b +1, so for b >=2, b\u00b2 -2b +1 < b\u00b2 -1, since -2b +1 < -1 when b >=1. Therefore, (b-1)^2 < b\u00b2 -1. So the maximum k is floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)), which is b -1. So the possible k's are integers from 2 up to b-1? Wait, let me think again.\n\nWait, the minimal n is b, so the minimal k is sqrt(b). Since k must be integer, so k starts from ceiling(sqrt(b)). The maximum n is b\u00b2 -1, so maximum k is floor(sqrt(b\u00b2 -1)). Since sqrt(b\u00b2 -1) is less than b, the maximum k is b-1. Therefore, the possible k's are integers from ceiling(sqrt(b)) up to b -1.\n\nTherefore, for each b, the possible k's are integers k where ceiling(sqrt(b)) <= k <= b-1, and such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and then the corresponding d1 and d2 must satisfy the digit constraints (d1 between 1 and b-1, d2 between 0 and b-1).\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to, for each base b, count the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(b)), b-1] such that (k^2 -k) is divisible by (b-1), and also ensuring that d2 =k - [ (k^2 -k)/(b-1) ] is between 0 and b-1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the divisibility condition is the main constraint here.\n\nSo, first, let me formalize:\n\nLet me denote m = b-1. Then, since b >=2, m >=1. Then, the equation becomes:\n\nd1 = [k(k -1)] / m,\n\nand m = b-1,\n\nso we need m divides k(k-1).\n\nTherefore, for each m >=1 (i.e., b = m +1 >=2), the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] (since b = m+1, so the upper limit for k is b-1 = m) such that m divides k(k-1), and also d1 = k(k-1)/m must be between 1 and m (since d1 <= b-1 = m), and d2 =k - d1 must be between 0 and m (since d2 <= b-1 = m).\n\nWait, but since d1 must be at least 1, then k(k -1)/m >=1, so k(k-1) >= m.\n\nAlso, d1 <= m, so k(k-1)/m <= m, so k(k-1) <= m\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, for each m, the k's must satisfy:\n\nceil(sqrt(m+1)) <= k <= m,\n\nand\n\nk(k -1) \u2261 0 mod m,\n\nand\n\nk(k -1) >= m,\n\nand\n\nk(k -1) <= m\u00b2,\n\nand also d2 = k - [k(k -1)/m] must be between 0 and m.\n\nBut perhaps the main constraints are the divisibility and the bounds on k.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of this as follows: For each m (i.e., each base b = m+1), we need to find the number of integers k between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m such that m divides k(k-1). Since m divides k(k-1), m must be a divisor of k(k-1). Since k and k-1 are consecutive integers, they are coprime. Therefore, m must be a divisor that can be split into factors that divide k and k-1 respectively.\n\nTherefore, since gcd(k, k-1) =1, m must divide the product k(k-1), so m must be a product of two coprime numbers, one dividing k and the other dividing k-1. Therefore, the number of solutions k is equal to the number of divisors of m, but this might be a bit more involved.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, we can compute the number of k between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m such that m divides k(k-1). Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's better to approach this by trying to compute for each base b, the number of such k's and find when this number exceeds 10.\n\nBut since the problem is asking for the minimal b where this count exceeds 10, perhaps we can look for when the number of solutions k increases as b increases, and find the first b where the count is 11 or more.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can find an expression for the number of solutions.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each m = b-1, the number of k in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides k(k-1). Let me note that since k and k-1 are coprime, m must divide either k or k-1, but since they are coprime, m must divide one of them, but not necessarily both. Wait, actually, if m divides the product of two coprime numbers, then m must be a product of a divisor of k and a divisor of (k-1). Since they are coprime, the divisors must be coprime. So m must be expressible as d1*d2 where d1 divides k and d2 divides (k-1), and d1 and d2 are coprime. But since m = d1*d2, then d1 and d2 must be coprime. So the number of solutions would be related to the number of ways to split m into such d1 and d2, but this might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for each m, the number of k's is equal to the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that k \u22610 mod d or k \u22611 mod d, where d divides m? Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, since m divides k(k-1), then either m divides k or m divides (k-1), or m divides some combination. Wait, but since m divides the product of coprime numbers, m can be split into factors dividing each term. Since gcd(k, k-1)=1, then m must divide k or m divides (k-1). Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. For example, if m is composite, say m=6, then 6 divides k(k-1). Suppose k=5, then 5*4=20, which 6 doesn't divide. Wait, maybe my previous thought was wrong.\n\nWait, actually, if m divides the product of two coprime numbers, then m can be written as m1*m2 where m1 divides k and m2 divides (k-1), and m1 and m2 are coprime. So the number of solutions would be equal to the number of ways to split m into coprime factors m1 and m2, then set k \u22610 mod m1 and k \u22611 mod m2. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps a better approach is to note that k \u22610 mod d or k\u22611 mod d for some divisors of m? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe instead of trying to find a general formula, we can consider small values of m (i.e., small b) and see how the count grows, and then look for when it exceeds 10. Since the problem asks for the minimal b where the count exceeds 10, maybe we can iterate over b starting from 2 upwards, compute the number of b-eautiful numbers, and stop when we find the first b where the count is more than 10.\n\nGiven that the problem is asking for the minimal such b, perhaps this brute-force approach is feasible, especially since the answer is likely not too large (since the example given is base 13, which already has at least one such number, so maybe the required b is in the teens or low 20s?).\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern or a smarter way.\n\nLet me try to formalize the count for a given m = b-1.\n\nLet\u2019s denote m = b -1, so b = m +1.\n\nWe need to find the number of integers k in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] such that m divides k(k -1).\n\nLet\u2019s denote the condition as k(k -1) \u22610 mod m.\n\nWe can think of this as k \u22610 mod m or k \u22611 mod m, but that would only be the case if m divides k or m divides (k-1). But actually, since m divides the product, but k and k-1 are coprime, so m can have factors dividing either k or k-1, but not both. Therefore, for each divisor d of m, we can have k \u22610 mod d and k \u22611 mod (m/d). Hmm, this is getting into the Chinese Remainder Theorem.\n\nAlternatively, the number of solutions to k(k -1) \u22610 mod m is equal to the number of solutions to k \u22610 mod d and k \u22611 mod (m/d) for each divisor d of m. But this might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, note that the equation k(k -1) \u22610 mod m is equivalent to k \u22610 mod m or k \u22611 mod m only if m is a prime power? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can think of the number of solutions as multiplicative over the prime factors of m. Maybe using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, but perhaps this is too involved.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider that for each m, the number of k in [a, m], where a = ceil(sqrt(m+1)), such that m divides k(k-1). Let's think of possible k values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that k and k-1 are coprime, so m divides k(k-1) implies that m must divide into the product, but since they are coprime, m must be a factor that splits into factors dividing each term. Therefore, m must be expressible as m1*m2 where m1 divides k and m2 divides (k-1), and m1 and m2 are coprime.\n\nTherefore, for each such pair (m1, m2), the number of solutions would be the number of k \u22610 mod m1 and k \u22611 mod m2. But since m1 and m2 are coprime, by Chinese remainder theorem, there is a unique solution mod m. So each such pair gives exactly one solution in the range 1 to m. But since we are looking for k between ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and m, perhaps each pair contributes at most one solution.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions would be equal to the number of ways to factor m into coprime pairs (m1, m2), but this might be equal to 2^{number of prime factors of m}. Wait, perhaps the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors of m?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions k in 1 to m is equal to the number of divisors of m? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let's take a small m and compute the number of solutions manually.\n\nLet me try with m=12 (so b=13, as in the example). Then m=12, so b=13.\n\nWe need to find k between ceil(sqrt(13))=4 and 12, so k from 4 to 12, such that 12 divides k(k-1).\n\nLet me list k from 4 to 12 and check:\n\nk=4: 4*3=12 \u2192 12 divides 12 \u2192 yes. So that's one solution.\n\nk=5: 5*4=20 \u2192 20 mod12=8 \u2192 no.\n\nk=6:6*5=30 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\nk=7:7*6=42 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\nk=8:8*7=56 mod12=8 \u2192 no.\n\nk=9:9*8=72 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nk=10:10*9=90 mod12=6 \u2192 no.\n\nk=11:11*10=110 mod12=10 \u2192 no.\n\nk=12:12*11=132 mod12=0 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo the solutions are k=4,9,12. But wait, in the example, 81 is 63 in base13, so k=9 (since sqrt(81)=9). The other solutions would be for k=4 and k=12.\n\nWait, let's check those:\n\nFor k=4:\n\nd1 = [4*3]/12 = 12/12=1.\n\nd2 =4 -1=3.\n\nSo the number is 1*13 +3=16. The digits are 1 and 3, sum to 4, sqrt(16)=4. So that's valid.\n\nFor k=12:\n\nd1 = [12*11]/12 =11. So d1=11, which is allowed in base13 (digits go up to 12). Then d2=12 -11=1.\n\nThus, the number is 11*13 +1=143 +1=144, which is 12\u00b2. The digits are 11 and 1, sum to 12, which is sqrt(144)=12. So that's valid.\n\nSo total of 3 solutions for m=12 (b=13). The example had one, but there are two more.\n\nWait, so in the problem statement, the example is just one of them. So in base13, there are three b-eautiful numbers: 16, 81, and 144? Wait, but 144 in base13 is 11*13 +1 = 144, so written as \"11 1\", so digits sum to 12, which is sqrt(144). So that works.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the example says 81 is 13-eautiful. So that's one of the three.\n\nTherefore, for m=12 (b=13), there are 3 such numbers. So the count is 3 here.\n\nSo maybe when m increases, the number of solutions increases. Let me try with a larger m. Let's try m=24 (so b=25). Let me see.\n\nWait, but perhaps we can find a better way.\n\nAlternatively, let me note that for each m, the number of k's satisfying k(k-1) \u22610 mod m is equal to the number of solutions to k \u22610 mod d and k \u22611 mod (m/d) for each divisor d of m. But since d and m/d must be coprime (because d divides m and m/d divides m, but since k \u22610 mod d and k\u22611 mod (m/d), then gcd(d, m/d) must divide 1, so they must be coprime). Therefore, each such pair (d, m/d) where d divides m and gcd(d, m/d)=1 corresponds to a solution.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions is equal to the number of divisors d of m such that gcd(d, m/d)=1. Since d and m/d are coprime, such divisors d are exactly the divisors of m that are coprime to m/d, but since d and m/d are coprime, this is equivalent to d being a divisor of m where d divides m and gcd(d, m/d)=1.\n\nAlternatively, since d and m/d are coprime, the number of such d is equal to 2^{number of prime factors of m}. Because for each prime in the prime factorization of m, we can choose whether to put it in d or in m/d, but since they have to be coprime, each prime can be in only one of them. Therefore, the number of such divisors d is 2^{\u03c9(m)}, where \u03c9(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m.\n\nWait, that might be the case. Let me see with m=12. The prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3. So \u03c9(m)=2, so 2^2=4. But earlier, we found 3 solutions for m=12. Hmm, discrepancy here. Maybe my reasoning is off.\n\nWait, let's see:\n\nThe divisors d of 12 where gcd(d, 12/d)=1:\n\nLet me list all divisors d of 12:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.\n\nCheck each d:\n\nd=1: gcd(1, 12/1)=gcd(1,12)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2, 6)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=3: gcd(3,4)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=4: gcd(4,3)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=6: gcd(6, 2)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=12: gcd(12,1)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nTherefore, the qualifying d's are 1,3,4,12. So four divisors. But when we computed for m=12, we had 3 solutions. Hmm, so perhaps each divisor corresponds to a solution, but some solutions may be outside the range [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m]. Let's see:\n\nEach divisor d gives a solution via the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let's compute the solutions for each d:\n\nFor each d in {1,3,4,12}:\n\nFor d=1:\n\nWe need k \u22610 mod1 (always true) and k\u22611 mod (12/1)=12. So k \u22611 mod12. The solution in 1 to 12 is k=1. But since our k must be at least ceil(sqrt(13))=4, so k=1 is too small. So this solution is outside the range.\n\nFor d=3:\n\nNeed k \u22610 mod3 and k\u22611 mod(12/3)=4.\n\nFind k \u22610 mod3 and k\u22611 mod4.\n\nSolutions mod 12:\n\nFind x \u22610 mod3,\n\nx\u22611 mod4.\n\nPossible x: Let's see:\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod4: 1,5,9,13,...\n\nLooking for one divisible by 3: 9 is 9 mod12. 9 mod4 is 1 (since 9-8=1). So k=9 mod12. So the solution is 9, which is within the range 4 to 12. So k=9.\n\nFor d=4:\n\nNeed k\u22610 mod4 and k\u22611 mod(12/4)=3.\n\nSo k \u22610 mod4 and k\u22611 mod3.\n\nFind x \u22610 mod4,\n\nx\u22611 mod3.\n\nPossible x: 4 mod4, so x=4,8,12,...\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n4 mod3=1 \u2192 4 mod3=1 \u2192 so 4 is solution. 4 mod3=1, so yes. 8 mod3=2, 12 mod3=0. So the solution is 4 mod12. Thus k=4, which is within the range.\n\nFor d=12:\n\nNeed k\u22610 mod12 and k\u22611 mod1 (since m/d=1). Since mod1 is always 0, but the condition is k\u22611 mod1, which is always true. So k\u22610 mod12. So k=12. Which is within the range.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are k=4,9,12. So three solutions, but there are four divisors. The divisor d=1 gives a solution k=1 which is below the minimum k=4, so it's excluded. Therefore, the total solutions within the range are 3, which matches our previous count.\n\nTherefore, the number of solutions in [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m] is equal to the number of divisors d of m with gcd(d, m/d)=1, minus those solutions where k is less than the lower bound (ceil(sqrt(m+1))).\n\nTherefore, in order to compute the number of solutions, we can:\n\n1. Find all divisors d of m where gcd(d, m/d)=1.\n\n2. For each such d, compute the solution k via Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT), which is unique mod m, so in 1 to m there's exactly one solution.\n\n3. Count how many of these solutions k are in the interval [ceil(sqrt(m+1)), m].\n\nThus, the number of solutions is equal to the number of such d's minus those d's whose corresponding k is less than the lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lower bound is ceil(sqrt(m+1)), so for each solution k, we need to check if it's >= ceil(sqrt(m+1)).\n\nTherefore, the process is:\n\nFor each m (starting from b=2 upwards, so m from 1 upwards):\n\n- Enumerate all divisors d of m where gcd(d, m/d)=1.\n\n- For each such d, compute the solution k via CRT as above.\n\n- Count how many of those k's satisfy k >= ceil(sqrt(m+1)) and k <= m.\n\n- The count is the number of b-eautiful numbers for base b = m +1.\n\nWe need to find the smallest m (so the smallest b = m +1) where this count exceeds 10.\n\nThis seems manageable, but doing this for each m step by step might be tedious, but perhaps manageable with some pattern recognition or formula.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can note that the number of divisors d with gcd(d, m/d)=1 is 2^{\u03c9(m)}, where \u03c9(m) is the number of distinct prime factors of m. Because for each prime factor, you can choose whether to put it into d or into m/d, so each prime gives a factor of 2, leading to 2^{\u03c9(m)}. However, in the case of m=12, which has \u03c9=2 (primes 2 and 3), 2^2=4, which matches the four divisors d=1,3,4,12. So that formula holds. However, in the case of m=6 (primes 2 and 3, \u03c9=2), divisors d with gcd(d, m/d)=1 would be:\n\nDivisors of 6:1,2,3,6.\n\nCheck each d:\n\nd=1: gcd(1,6)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2, 3)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=3: gcd(3,2)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=6: gcd(6,1)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo all four divisors. So 2^2=4, which matches.\n\nTherefore, the number of such d's is indeed 2^{\u03c9(m)}.\n\nTherefore, the total number of solutions k (without considering the lower bound) is 2^{\u03c9(m)}.\n\nHowever, some of these solutions may lie below the lower bound ceil(sqrt(m+1)), so we need to subtract those.\n\nThus, for each m, the number of b-eautiful numbers is:\n\nNumber of solutions = 2^{\u03c9(m)} - number of solutions k where k < ceil(sqrt(m +1)).\n\nTherefore, to compute this, we need to find for each m, how many of the solutions k (each corresponding to a divisor d) are below the lower bound.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lower bound is not too restrictive for large m. So if m is large enough, then the number of solutions is roughly 2^{\u03c9(m)}, so to get over 10, we need 2^{\u03c9(m)} > 10. So \u03c9(m) must be at least 4, since 2^4=16. However, this is only an approximation because some solutions may be below the lower bound. So maybe m needs to have at least 4 prime factors?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m with many prime factors would have more solutions. Let's try some examples.\n\nLet me try m=30 (so b=31). Then \u03c9(m)=3 (primes 2,3,5). So 2^3=8 solutions. Let's see:\n\nDivisors d of 30 where gcd(d, 30/d)=1:\n\nFirst, list all divisors of 30:\n\n1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.\n\nCheck which d's satisfy gcd(d,30/d)=1:\n\nd=1: gcd(1,30)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2,15)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=3: gcd(3,10)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=5: gcd(5,6)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=6: gcd(6,5)=1? gcd(6,5)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, d=6 divides 30, so 30/d=5. gcd(6,5)=1. Yes.\n\nWait, but 6 and 5 are coprime. Wait, but 6 is 2*3, and 5 is prime. So yes.\n\nWait, but 6 is a divisor of 30, so 30/d=5. gcd(6,5)=1.\n\nSimilarly,\n\nd=10: gcd(10,3)=1? gcd(10,3)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=15: gcd(15,2)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=30: gcd(30,1)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nWait, so all divisors of 30 qualify? Wait, but 6 and 30/d=5, yes. Wait, but 6 is 2*3, and 5 is coprime. Similarly, 10 is 2*5, and 30/10=3, which is coprime to 10? gcd(10,3)=1. So yes. So all divisors of 30 satisfy gcd(d, m/d)=1? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check:\n\nTake d=6 and m/d=5, so gcd(6,5)=1.\n\nd=10: m/d=3, gcd(10,3)=1.\n\nd=15: m/d=2, gcd(15,2)=1.\n\nd=30: m/d=1, gcd(30,1)=1.\n\nSo indeed, all divisors of 30 satisfy the condition. Therefore, there are 8 solutions. Let's see the solutions:\n\nFor each d, compute k via CRT.\n\nStarting with d=1:\n\nk \u22610 mod1 (always true), and k\u22611 mod30. So k=1 mod30. Within 1-30, the solution is k=1. But the lower bound is ceil(sqrt(31))\u22485.58, so 6. So k=1 is too small.\n\nd=2:\n\nk \u22610 mod2, and k\u22611 mod15 (since m/d=30/2=15).\n\nFind k \u22610 mod2 and k\u22611 mod15.\n\nFind x \u22611 mod15, even.\n\nNumbers congruent to 1 mod15: 1,16,31,... The even one is 16 mod30. So k=16.\n\nCheck 16 mod2=0, 16 mod15=1. Yes. So k=16 is in the range [6,30].\n\nd=3:\n\nk \u22610 mod3, k\u22611 mod10 (since m/d=30/3=10).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod3 and x\u22611 mod10.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod10: 1,11,21,31,...\n\nCheck divisibility by 3: 1 mod3=1, 11 mod3=2, 21 mod3=0 \u2192 21. So k=21 mod30. So k=21, which is within [6,30].\n\nd=5:\n\nk\u22610 mod5, k\u22611 mod6 (since m/d=30/5=6).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod5 and x\u22611 mod6.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod6:1,7,13,19,25,31,...\n\nCheck divisibility by5:\n\n25 mod5=0 \u2192 25. So k=25 mod30. So k=25 is within range.\n\nd=6:\n\nk\u22610 mod6, k\u22611 mod5 (since m/d=30/6=5).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod6 and x\u22611 mod5.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod5:1,6,11,16,21,26,31,...\n\nCheck divisible by6: 6 mod5=1 \u2192 6 mod5=1? Wait, 6 mod5=1, yes. So 6 mod5=1, so 6 is a solution. So k=6 mod30. So k=6 is within the range (since 6 is the lower bound). So k=6.\n\nd=10:\n\nk\u22610 mod10, k\u22611 mod3 (since m/d=30/10=3).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod10 and x\u22611 mod3.\n\nNumbers divisible by10:10,20,30,...\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n10 mod3=1 \u2192 yes. So k=10 mod30. 10 is within range.\n\nd=15:\n\nk\u22610 mod15, k\u22611 mod2 (since m/d=30/15=2).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod15 and x\u22611 mod2.\n\nNumbers divisible by15:15,30,...\n\nCheck mod2: 15 mod2=1, so 15 is a solution. So k=15 mod30. 15 is within range.\n\nd=30:\n\nk\u22610 mod30, k\u22611 mod1 (always true). So k=30 mod30. k=30 is within the range.\n\nNow, compiling all solutions:\n\nFrom the divisors:\n\nd=1: k=1 (too small)\n\nd=2: k=16\n\nd=3: k=21\n\nd=5: k=25\n\nd=6: k=6\n\nd=10: k=10\n\nd=15: k=15\n\nd=30: k=30\n\nSo total solutions within the range are 7 (excluding k=1). So total of 7 solutions for m=30 (b=31). Hmm, but 2^3=8, but one solution was too small. So the count is 7.\n\nTherefore, the formula is 2^{\u03c9(m)} minus the number of solutions below the lower bound.\n\nHmm, so maybe for m with more prime factors, the number of solutions increases, but some may be excluded.\n\nWait, let's try m=60 (b=61). \u03c9(m)=4 (primes 2,3,5). So 2^4=16 solutions. Let's see how many are above the lower bound.\n\nFirst, compute the lower bound: sqrt(61)\u22487.81, so ceil(7.81)=8.\n\nSo k must be between 8 and 60.\n\nThe number of solutions would be 16 minus the number of solutions less than 8.\n\nBut enumerating all solutions would take time. Let me see if there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of solutions is roughly doubling each time we add a prime factor, so m with \u03c9=4 might have 16 solutions, but some might be below the lower bound. If the lower bound is not too high, maybe 16 - something small.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m=60 would give us 16 solutions, minus some number, but maybe it's over 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can try m=24 (b=25). Let's see.\n\nm=24 (b=25). \u03c9(m)=2 (primes 2,3). So 2^2=4 solutions, but need to check.\n\nWait, first, divisors d of 24 with gcd(d,24/d)=1.\n\nDivisors of 24: 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24.\n\nCheck which d's satisfy gcd(d,24/d)=1.\n\nd=1: gcd(1,24)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2,12)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=3: gcd(3,8)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=4: gcd(4,6)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=6: gcd(6,4)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=8: gcd(8,3)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=12: gcd(12,2)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=24: gcd(24,1)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nThus qualifying d's:1,3,8,24.\n\nSo four solutions.\n\nNow compute the solutions:\n\nFor each d:\n\nd=1:\n\nk\u22610 mod1 (always) and k\u22611 mod24 \u2192 k=1 mod24. k=1 is below ceil(sqrt(25))=5. So excluded.\n\nd=3:\n\nk\u22610 mod3, k\u22611 mod8 (since 24/3=8).\n\nFind x \u22610 mod3 and x\u22611 mod8.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod8:1,9,17,25,...\n\nCheck mod3: 1 mod3=1, 9 mod3=0 \u2192 9. So k=9 mod24. So k=9 is within [5,24].\n\nd=8:\n\nk\u22610 mod8, k\u22611 mod3 (since 24/8=3).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod8 and x\u22611 mod3.\n\nNumbers divisible by8:8,16,24,...\n\nCheck mod3: 8 mod3=2, 16 mod3=1 \u219216 mod3=1. So k=16 mod24. 16 is within range.\n\nd=24:\n\nk\u22610 mod24 and k\u22611 mod1 \u2192 k=24 mod24. So k=24, which is within [5,24].\n\nThus, the solutions are k=9,16,24. The d=1 solution (k=1) is excluded. So total of 3 solutions for m=24 (b=25).\n\nHmm, so even with \u03c9=2, it's 4 solutions minus 1, giving 3. Not enough.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look for m with higher \u03c9(m). Let's try m=60 (b=61). \u03c9=4.\n\nBut to compute this manually would be time-consuming, so perhaps I can think of another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the minimal m where the number of solutions exceeds 10 is when 2^{\u03c9(m)} exceeds 10, but with some solutions not excluded. Since 2^4=16, so if \u03c9(m)>=4, then 16 solutions. If the lower bound excludes, say, 5 solutions, then 11 left. So maybe m with \u03c9=4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps m=30 (which had \u03c9=3 and gave 7 solutions), m=60 (\u03c9=4, maybe 16 solutions minus some). Let me see if m=60 gives enough.\n\nLet me try to compute for m=60 (b=61):\n\nLower bound is ceil(sqrt(61))\u22487.81 \u2192 8.\n\nSo k must be between 8 and 60.\n\nDivisors d of 60 with gcd(d,60/d)=1.\n\nFirst, prime factors of 60 are 2,3,5 (so \u03c9=3). Wait, no, 60 factors into 2^2*3*5, so \u03c9=3. Wait, so 2^{3}=8 solutions? Wait, but earlier thought was m=60 has \u03c9=4? Wait no, m=60 is 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00d75, so three distinct primes. So \u03c9=3. So 2^3=8 solutions? But that contradicts earlier thought that m=60 would have \u03c9=4. Wait, my mistake earlier, m=60 is 2\u00d73\u00d75, so \u03c9=3. So 2^3=8 solutions. Hmm.\n\nWait, so let's recast:\n\nWait m=60. Let's compute the divisors d with gcd(d,60/d)=1.\n\nFirst, list all divisors of 60:\n\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60.\n\nNow check each d:\n\nd=1: gcd(1,60)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2,30)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=3: gcd(3,20)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=4: gcd(4,15)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=5: gcd(5,12)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=6: gcd(6,10)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=10: gcd(10,6)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=12: gcd(12,5)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=15: gcd(15,4)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=20: gcd(20,3)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nd=30: gcd(30,2)=2\u22601 \u2192 no.\n\nd=60: gcd(60,1)=1 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo qualifying d's: 1,3,4,5,12,15,20,60. Total of 8 divisors (2^3=8).\n\nNow compute the solutions for each d:\n\nd=1:\n\nk \u22610 mod1 (always true), k\u22611 mod60. So k=1 mod60. Since lower bound is 8, k=1 is excluded.\n\nd=3:\n\nk \u22610 mod3, k\u22611 mod20 (since 60/3=20).\n\nFind x \u22610 mod3 and x\u22611 mod20.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod20:1,21,41,61,...\n\nCheck mod3: 1 mod3=1, 21 mod3=0 \u2192 21. So k=21 mod60. 21 is within [8,60].\n\nd=4:\n\nk \u22610 mod4, k\u22611 mod15 (since 60/4=15).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod4 and x\u22611 mod15.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod15:1,16,31,46,61,...\n\nCheck mod4: 1 mod4=1, 16 mod4=0 \u219216. So k=16 mod60. 16 is within range.\n\nd=5:\n\nk \u22610 mod5, k\u22611 mod12 (since 60/5=12).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod5 and x\u22611 mod12.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod12:1,13,25,37,49,61,...\n\nCheck mod5: 25 mod5=0 \u219225. So k=25 mod60. Within range.\n\nd=12:\n\nk \u22610 mod12, k\u22611 mod5 (since 60/12=5).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod12 and x\u22611 mod5.\n\nNumbers divisible by12:12,24,36,48,60,...\n\nCheck mod5:\n\n12 mod5=2,\n\n24 mod5=4,\n\n36 mod5=1 \u219236 mod5=1. So k=36 mod60. 36 is within range.\n\nd=15:\n\nk\u22610 mod15, k\u22611 mod4 (since 60/15=4).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod15 and x\u22611 mod4.\n\nNumbers divisible by15:15,30,45,60,...\n\nCheck mod4:\n\n15 mod4=3,\n\n30 mod4=2,\n\n45 mod4=1 \u219245 mod4=1. So k=45 mod60. 45 is within range.\n\nd=20:\n\nk\u22610 mod20, k\u22611 mod3 (since 60/20=3).\n\nFind x\u22610 mod20 and x\u22611 mod3.\n\nNumbers divisible by20:20,40,60,...\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n20 mod3=2,\n\n40 mod3=1 \u219240 mod3=1. So k=40 mod60. 40 is within range.\n\nd=60:\n\nk\u22610 mod60, k\u22611 mod1 \u2192 k=60 mod60. So k=60, which is within [8,60].\n\nThus, the solutions are:\n\nFrom d=1: k=1 (excluded)\n\nd=3:21,\n\nd=4:16,\n\nd=5:25,\n\nd=12:36,\n\nd=15:45,\n\nd=20:40,\n\nd=60:60.\n\nTotal solutions:7 (since 8 divisors minus 1 excluded). Wait, but 2^3=8 solutions total, but one is below the lower bound (k=1). So total of 7 solutions for m=60 (b=61).\n\nHmm, still not enough. Let's try m=210 (b=211). \u03c9(m)=4 (primes 2,3,5,7). So 2^4=16 solutions. Let's see:\n\nFirst, the lower bound is ceil(sqrt(211))\u224814.5, so 15.\n\nSo k must be between 15 and 210.\n\nDivisors d of 210 where gcd(d,210/d)=1.\n\n210 factors into 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77, so \u03c9=4.\n\nThe divisors d would be products of subsets of the prime factors. Since each prime must be entirely in d or in 210/d, so each divisor d is a product of some subset of the prime factors, and the remaining primes are in 210/d. So total of 2^4=16 divisors.\n\nEach such divisor d will correspond to a solution k.\n\nHowever, many of these solutions might be below 15. Let's see:\n\nTake d=1: solution k=1 mod210 \u2192 k=1, too small.\n\nd=2: gcd(2,105)=1? 210/2=105. gcd(2,105)=1? 105 is divisible by 3,5,7. gcd(2,105)=1 \u2192 yes. So d=2 is allowed.\n\nWait, but in general, for each d which is a product of a subset of the prime factors, the solution k will be:\n\nk \u22610 mod d,\n\nk\u22611 mod (210/d).\n\nSo for each d, the solution is unique mod210. Let's see a few examples:\n\nd=2:\n\nk \u22610 mod2,\n\nk\u22611 mod105.\n\nFind x\u22611 mod105 and even.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod105: 1,106,211,...\n\nEven number is 106 mod210. So k=106. Which is within 15-210.\n\nd=3:\n\nk\u22610 mod3,\n\nk\u22611 mod70 (210/3=70).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod70 and divisible by3.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod70:1,71,141,211,...\n\nCheck mod3:\n\n1 mod3=1,\n\n71 mod3= 71-69=2 \u2192 mod3=2,\n\n141 mod3=0 \u2192141. So k=141 mod210. Within range.\n\nd=5:\n\nk\u22610 mod5,\n\nk\u22611 mod42 (210/5=42).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod42 divisible by5.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod42:1,43,85,127,169,211,...\n\nCheck mod5:\n\n1 mod5=1,\n\n43 mod5=3,\n\n85 mod5=0 \u219285. So k=85 mod210. 85 is within range.\n\nd=7:\n\nk\u22610 mod7,\n\nk\u22611 mod30 (210/7=30).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod30 divisible by7.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod30:1,31,61,91,121,151,181,211,...\n\nCheck mod7:\n\n1 mod7=1,\n\n31 mod7=3,\n\n61 mod7=5,\n\n91 mod7=0 \u219291. So k=91 mod210. Within range.\n\nd=2\u00d73=6:\n\nk\u22610 mod6,\n\nk\u22611 mod35 (210/(6)=35).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod35 divisible by6.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod35:1,36,71,106,141,176,211,...\n\nCheck mod6:\n\n1 mod6=1,\n\n36 mod6=0 \u219236. So k=36 mod210. 36 is within 15-210.\n\nd=2\u00d75=10:\n\nk\u22610 mod10,\n\nk\u22611 mod21 (210/10=21).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod21 divisible by10.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod21:1,22,43,64,85,106,127,148,169,190,211,...\n\nCheck mod10:\n\n1 mod10=1,\n\n22 mod10=2,\n\n43 mod10=3,\n\n64 mod10=4,\n\n85 mod10=5,\n\n106 mod10=6,\n\n127 mod10=7,\n\n148 mod10=8,\n\n169 mod10=9,\n\n190 mod10=0 \u2192190 mod10=0. So k=190 mod210. 190 is within range.\n\nd=2\u00d77=14:\n\nk\u22610 mod14,\n\nk\u22611 mod15 (210/14=15).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod15 divisible by14.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod15:1,16,31,46,61,76,91,106,121,136,151,166,181,196,211,...\n\nCheck mod14:\n\n1 mod14=1,\n\n16 mod14=2,\n\n31 mod14=3,\n\n46 mod14=4,\n\n61 mod14=5,\n\n76 mod14=8,\n\n91 mod14=7,\n\n106 mod14= 106-7*14=106-98=8,\n\nWait, let me compute properly:\n\n1 mod14=1,\n\n16 mod14=2,\n\n31 mod14=3,\n\n46 mod14=4,\n\n61 mod14=61-4*14=61-56=5,\n\n76 mod14=76-5*14=76-70=6,\n\n91 mod14=0 \u219291 is divisible by14 (14\u00d76.5?

Let me try m= 210 is the first with 15 solutions. Let me see m= 180 (b=181):\n\nWait m=180 (b=181). \u03c9(m)=3 (2,3,5). So 8 solutions.\n\nLower bound is sqrt(181)\u224813.45 \u219214.\n\nDivisors d of 180 with gcd(d,180/d)=1:\n\nFactors of 180=2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75. \u03c9=3.\n\nDivisors d must be products of subsets of the primes 2,3,5.\n\nSo possible d's are 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.\n\nWait, let me list all divisors:\n\nDivisors of 180:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, 180.\n\nCheck which qualify:\n\nd=1: yes.\n\nd=2: gcd(2,90)=2\u22601 \u2192 no (since 180/2=90, gcd(2,90)=2).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider only divisors that are products of the primes. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, to have gcd(d, 180/d)=1, d must be a product of some subset of the primes 2,3,5, and the remaining primes in 180/d must be the complement. Since the exponents don't matter for coprimality.\n\nSo the qualifying divisors are the products of subsets of {2,3,5}:\n\nPossible subsets:\n\n- Empty set: d=1.\n\n- {2}: d=2.\n\n- {3}: d=3.\n\n- {5}: d=5.\n\n- {2,3}: d=6.\n\n- {2,5}: d=10.\n\n- {3,5}: d=15.\n\n- {2,3,5}: d=30.\n\nThus, these 8 divisors qualify. Let's confirm:\n\nFor example, d=2: gcd(2, 90)=gcd(2, 3\u00b2\u00d75)=2 \u22601 \u2192 no. Wait, this contradicts my previous thought.\n\nWait, my mistake. The factors must include the exponents. Since 180 has 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75, so d can have any combination of the primes 2,3,5 with exponents, but for gcd(d, 180/d)=1, the primes in d and 180/d must be disjoint.\n\nThus, d can only have primes from 2,3,5, but not both in d and in 180/d. So for example, d can't have 2 and 3, because 180/d would still have 2 or 3 if d has some exponents.\n\nWait, actually, the exact exponents might not matter. For example, if d has 2^a, then 180/d has 2^(2\u2212a). To have gcd(d, 180/d)=1, the exponents must be such that d and 180/d share no common prime factors. Which would require that for each prime, d contains all the exponent of that prime in 180, or none. \n\nThus, for each prime p in {2,3,5}, either all the exponents of p in 180 are in d or none.\n\nSince 180 has 2\u00b2,3\u00b2,5\u00b9.\n\nThus, for prime 2: either include all 2\u00b2 in d or none.\n\nSimilarly, for prime3: all 3\u00b2 or none.\n\nFor prime5: all 5\u00b9 or none.\n\nThus, the qualifying divisors are products of these choices:\n\nFor each prime:\n\n- Include all of 2\u00b2 or not.\n\n- Include all of 3\u00b2 or not.\n\n- Include all of 5\u00b9 or not.\n\nThus, the number of such divisors is 2\u00d72\u00d72=8.\n\nThese divisors are:\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75\u00b9 (180),\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2 (36),\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d75 (20),\n\n- 3\u00b2\u00d75 (45),\n\n- 2\u00b2 (4),\n\n- 3\u00b2 (9),\n\n- 5 (5),\n\n- 1 (1).\n\nThus the qualifying divisors are 1,4,5,9,20,36,45,180.\n\nWait this is different from my previous thought. So I must have made a mistake earlier.\n\nThus, let's recast:\n\nQualifying divisors are those that are products of the entire prime power components.\n\nSo divisors are:\n\n- 1 (no primes),\n\n- 2\u00b2=4,\n\n- 3\u00b2=9,\n\n- 5,\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2=36,\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d75=20,\n\n- 3\u00b2\u00d75=45,\n\n- 2\u00b2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75=180.\n\nSo these 8 divisors.\n\nNow compute solutions:\n\nd=1:\n\nk\u22611 mod180 \u2192k=1, excluded.\n\nd=4:\n\nk\u22610 mod4, k\u22611 mod45 (180/4=45).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod45 divisible by4.\n\nNumbers \u22611 mod45:1,46,91,136,181,...\n\nCheck divisible by4:\n\n46 mod4=2,\n\n91 mod4=3,\n\n136 mod4=0 \u2192136 mod180=136.

Still 7.\n\nHmm, so it seems that until m=210, which has \u03c9=4, we can't get more than 15 solutions. Since the first m with \u03c9=4 is 210, which gives 15 solutions, which is the first time it exceeds 10.\n\nWait, let me check m= 105 (b=106) had 7 solutions, m= 210 (b=211) has 15.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the least integer b\u22652 for which there are more than ten b-eautiful integers.\n\nThus, m=210 corresponds to b=211, which is the first base where the count exceeds 10.\n\nBut let me check if there is a smaller m with \u03c9=4. The minimal m with 4 distinct primes is 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210. So there is no smaller m with \u03c9=4. Thus, m=210 is indeed the first.\n\nHence, the answer is 211.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with m= 210, which is b=211, giving 15 solutions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe m= 105 (b=106) with \u03c9=3, but no, it had 7.\n\nWait, maybe m= 60 (b=61) with \u03c9=3 gives 7 solutions. So indeed, the first m with \u03c9=4 is 210, giving 15 solutions.\n\nTherefore, the minimal base is 211. However, let me check m= 210's calculation again to be sure.\n\nEarlier, for m=210, we found 15 solutions. Let me recount the solutions listed:\n\nFrom the earlier list:\n\n106,141,85,91,36,190,196,15,21,175,120,126,70,105,210.\n\nWait that's 15 numbers. Each of these k's gives a valid two-digit number in base b=211. Each has digits d1 and d2 where d1 + d2 =k and d1*b + d2 =k\u00b2.\n\nYes. So indeed, there are 15 such numbers.\n\nThus, the minimal b is 211. However, the problem says \"more than ten\", so 11 or more. 15 is more than ten, so 211 is the first such base.\n\nWait, but before I conclude, let me check m= 120 (b=121) had 7, m= 168 (b=169) had7, m= 180 had7, m= 210 is the first with 15.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a m with \u03c9=4 but less than 210? Wait, no, since 2\u00d73\u00d75\u00d77=210 is the minimal with four distinct primes.\n\nThus, the minimal b is 211. But let me check another m with \u03c9=4 but with exponents. Wait, no, \u03c9 counts distinct primes, so exponents don't matter. Thus, 210 is the first.\n\nWait, but let me check m= 105\u00d72=210, so indeed.\n\nWait, perhaps m= 84 (b=85) with \u03c9=3 gives 7, m= 90 (b=91). Let's try m= 90 (b=91). \u03c9=3 (2,3,5). So 8 solutions.\n\nDivisors d of 90 (2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75) with gcd(d,90/d)=1.\n\nQualifying divisors are products of subsets of primes 2,3,5 with all exponents:\n\nThus:\n\n1,\n\n2,\n\n3,\n\n5,\n\n2\u00d73=6,\n\n2\u00d75=10,\n\n3\u00d75=15,\n\n2\u00d73\u00d75=30.\n\nWait, but need to include all exponents for each prime.\n\nFor example, for prime3, since it has exponent2 in 90, to have gcd(d,90/d)=1, if we include 3\u00b2 in d, then 90/d won't have any 3s. So the divisors are:\n\n- 2^1 (since 2^1 is the full exponent of 2 in 90),\n\n- 3^2 (full exponent of3),\n\n-5^1,\n\nand their products.\n\nThus, the qualifying divisors are:\n\n1,\n\n2,\n\n3\u00b2=9,\n\n5,\n\n2\u00d73\u00b2=18,\n\n2\u00d75=10,\n\n3\u00b2\u00d75=45,\n\n2\u00d73\u00b2\u00d75=90.\n\nSo these 8 divisors.\n\nSolutions:\n\nd=1: k=1 mod90 \u2192excluded.\n\nd=2:\n\nk\u22610 mod2, k\u22611 mod45 (90/2=45).\n\nFind x\u22611 mod45 divisible by2 \u219246 mod90=46.

So b=211 is the answer.\n\nBut let me check m= 180 (b=181) had7, m= 210 (b=211) is next with15. Thus, the minimal base is 211.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"more than ten\", so 11 or more. So the first b where the count exceeds 10 is indeed 211.\n\nHence, the answer is \\boxed{211}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{211}\n\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to find the smallest base \\( b \\geq 2 \\) such that there are more than ten \\( b \\)-eautiful numbers. A \\( b \\)-eautiful number \\( n \\) is a two-digit number in base \\( b \\) where the sum of its digits equals the square root of \\( n \\).\n\n1. **Formalizing the Problem**:\n   - A two-digit number in base \\( b \\) is \\( n = d_1 \\cdot b + d_2 \\), where \\( d_1 \\) and \\( d_2 \\) are digits ( \\( 1 \\leq d_1 \\leq b-1 \\) and \\( 0 \\leq d_2 \\leq b-1 \\)).\n   - The condition is \\( d_1 + d_2 = \\sqrt{n} \\), so \\( n = k^2 \\) where \\( k = d_1 + d_2 \\).\n   - This leads to the equation \\( d_1 \\cdot (b - 1) = k(k - 1) \\).\n\n2. **Key Steps**:\n   - For a given base \\( b \\), we need to find integers \\( k \\) such that \\( k(k - 1) \\) is divisible by \\( b - 1 \\).\n   - The number of valid \\( k \\) values (and thus \\( b \\)-eautiful numbers) is determined by the number of divisors of \\( b - 1 \\) that satisfy certain coprimality conditions.\n\n3. **Analysis**:\n   - The number of solutions is related to the number of divisors of \\( m = b - 1 \\). Specifically, the number of solutions is \\( 2^{\\omega(m)} \\), where \\( \\omega(m) \\) is the number of distinct prime factors of \\( m \\).\n   - We need \\( 2^{\\omega(m)} \\) to exceed 10, which first occurs when \\( \\omega(m) \\geq 4 \\).\n\n4. **Finding the Minimum Base**:\n   - The smallest \\( m \\) with \\( \\omega(m) = 4 \\) is \\( m = 210 \\) (since \\( 210 = 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times 7 \\)).\n   - For \\( m = 210 \\), the corresponding base \\( b = 211 \\).\n   - Checking \\( m = 210 \\), we find there are 15 valid \\( k \\) values, which is more than ten.\n\nThus, the least integer \\( b \\) for which there are more than ten \\( b \\)-eautiful integers is \\(\\boxed{211}\\).",
