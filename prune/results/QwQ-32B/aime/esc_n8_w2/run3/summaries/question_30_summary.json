      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the product of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12, where \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, and then find the remainder when that product is divided by 1000. Hmm, roots of unity problems can be tricky, but maybe I can use some properties of cyclotomic polynomials or something like that.\n\nFirst, let me recall that since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, it's a primitive root, so it's a root of this polynomial.\n\nThe product given is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me see if I can manipulate the expression inside the product to make it more manageable. Let me consider each term:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}\n\nHmm, maybe factor out a 2? But that might not help much. Alternatively, notice that \u03c9^{2k} is (\u03c9^k)^2, so maybe substitute z = \u03c9^k, then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2. Wait, so each term is a quadratic in z. Let me write that:\n\nFor each k, term is z\u00b2 - 2z + 2, where z = \u03c9^k.\n\nTherefore, the product over all k from 0 to 12 of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) where z = \u03c9^k. Since \u03c9^0 = 1, so when k=0, z=1.\n\nSo the entire product is the product over all 13th roots of unity (including 1) of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). Except, but wait, the roots of unity are the solutions to z\u00b9\u00b3 = 1, so the product over all z^13 =1 of (z\u00b2 - 2z +2). But actually, since we are taking the product over all \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12, which are exactly the 13th roots of unity. So the product is the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2).\n\nTherefore, this product can be written as the product over all roots z of z\u00b9\u00b3 -1 =0 of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). Hmm, but maybe there's a way to relate this product to the polynomial z\u00b9\u00b3 -1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider evaluating some polynomial at certain points. Let me think. The product over (z - a_i) where a_i are roots of some polynomial is related to the value of that polynomial. But here the factors are quadratic in z. Maybe I can think of it as evaluating another polynomial?\n\nAlternatively, note that the product over (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) for all 13th roots z of unity is equal to the product over ( (z - \u03b1)(z - \u03b2) ) where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 =0. Let me compute the roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i. Therefore, each term (z\u00b2 - 2z +2) factors as (z - (1+i))(z - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product over all z being 13th roots of unity would be the product over all z of (z - (1+i))(z - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, the product is equal to [Product_{z^13=1} (z - (1 + i))] * [Product_{z^13=1} (z - (1 - i))]\n\nSo each of these products is the value of the polynomial P(x) = Product_{z^13=1} (x - z) evaluated at x =1 + i and x =1 -i respectively. But the polynomial Product_{z^13=1} (x - z) is just x\u00b9\u00b3 -1, because the roots of x\u00b9\u00b3 -1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity. Wait, but actually, the product over (x - z) where z^13 =1 is x\u00b9\u00b3 -1. Therefore, substituting x =1 + i gives (1 + i)^13 -1, and similarly for x=1 -i gives (1 -i)^13 -1. Therefore, the total product is [(1 + i)^13 -1] * [(1 -i)^13 -1]\n\nTherefore, the original product is equal to [(1 + i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1]. So now I need to compute this expression and then find its value modulo 1000.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me compute (1 + i)^13 first. Since 1 + i is a complex number, perhaps it's easier to write it in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2), and its angle (argument) is \u03c0/4 radians. So 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i*(13\u03c0/4)}. Similarly for (1 - i), which has modulus sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i*(13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So that term is 64\u221a2.\n\nNow, the angle for (1 + i)^13 is 13\u03c0/4. Let me reduce that angle modulo 2\u03c0. 13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is (13/4)/2 =13/8, so 13\u03c0/4 = 2\u03c0*(1) + 5\u03c0/4. So the angle is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, the angle for (1 - i)^13 is -13\u03c0/4, which is equivalent to -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = ( -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 )= 3\u03c0/4. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, for (1 -i)^13: angle is -\u03c0/4, so 13*(-\u03c0/4)= -13\u03c0/4. To add multiples of 2\u03c0 to get it within 0 to 2\u03c0: -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4. So yes, angle is 3\u03c0/4. Alternatively, since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, so -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = ( -13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0 ) /4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)] and (1 - i)^13 = 64\u221a2 [cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)]\n\nLet me compute each of these:\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, so (1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) + i (-\u221a2/2) ] = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i) = 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2)*(1 +i)\n\nSimplify that: \u221a2 * \u221a2 is 2, so 64*( -2/2)*(1 +i) = 64*(-1)*(1 +i) = -64(1 +i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is 64\u221a2 [cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) + i (\u221a2/2) ]\n\nSo that's 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2 ) = 64\u221a2*(\u221a2/2)( -1 +i ) = 64*( -1 +i )*( (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 ) ?\n\nWait, let me do step by step again:\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(3\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2. Therefore, the expression is:\n\n64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) + i*(\u221a2/2) ] = 64\u221a2 * [ (-\u221a2/2)(1 - i) ] ?\n\nWait, actually, let's compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (\u221a2 * -\u221a2)/2 = 64*(-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSecond term: 64\u221a2 * (i\u221a2/2 ) = 64*(\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 *i = 64*(2)/2 *i = 64i.\n\nTherefore, altogether, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, so:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64(1 +i) = -64 -64i.\n\n(1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i\n\nTherefore, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let me compute that.\n\nMultiply the two complex conjugates: (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but here it's actually ( (-65) + (-64i) ) and ( -65 +64i ). Wait, actually, more precisely:\n\nLet me write them as ( -65 -64i )*( -65 +64i ). Let me compute this as:\n\nLet me denote A = -65, B = -64i. Then the first term is A + B, second is A - B. Wait no: the second term is -65 +64i, so actually, perhaps better to see as:\n\nLet me compute ( (-65) -64i )*( (-65) +64i ) = [ (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 ] because (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. Wait, but here the terms are ( -65 -64i ) and ( -65 +64i ). Let me check:\n\nLet me set a = -65, b =64i. Then the product is (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\na\u00b2 = (-65)^2 = 4225\n\nb\u00b2 = (64i)^2 = 64\u00b2 * i\u00b2 = 4096*(-1) = -4096\n\nThus, the product is 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, so the product is 8321?\n\nWait, that's a real number, which makes sense because the two factors are complex conjugates, so their product is real.\n\nTherefore, the original product is 8321. Wait, but hold on. Wait, let me verify again step by step.\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i, as computed above. (1 -i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i. Then multiplying these two:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst: (-65)(-65) = 4225\n\nSecond: (-65)(64i) = -4160i\n\nThird: (-64i)(-65) = +4160i\n\nFourth: (-64i)(64i) = -4096 i\u00b2 = -4096*(-1) = +4096\n\nAdding all terms: 4225 -4160i +4160i +4096 = 4225 +4096 = 8321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321. Therefore, the remainder when divided by 1000 is 8321 mod 1000. Since 8000 is divisible by 1000, 8321 -8000 = 321, so the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check again if all steps are correct because 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321, but maybe I made a mistake in earlier steps?\n\nWait let me check the calculation of (1 +i)^13 again. Let me compute (1 +i)^13 step by step using binomial theorem? Hmm, that might be tedious but perhaps better to confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, since (1 +i)^2 = 2i, so (1 +i)^2 = 2i. Therefore, (1 +i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4, (1 +i)^8 = (-4)^2 =16, then (1 +i)^12 = (1 +i)^8 * (1 +i)^4 = 16*(-4) = -64, and then (1 +i)^13 = (1 +i)^12*(1 +i) = (-64)(1 +i) = -64 -64i. Which matches previous result. Similarly for (1 -i)^13:\n\n(1 -i)^2 = -2i, so (1 -i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4, (1 -i)^8 = (-4)^2 =16, (1 -i)^12 = (1 -i)^8*(1 -i)^4 = 16*(-4) = -64, then (1 -i)^13 = (1 -i)^12*(1 -i) = (-64)(1 -i) = -64 +64i. So that also matches. Therefore, the previous steps are correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is indeed 8321. Then 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 + 321, so remainder is 321. Therefore, the answer should be 321 mod 1000.\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem says \"the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000\". So 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So that's the answer?\n\nBut let me check again. Wait, but wait, the original problem is the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), and we transformed that into [(1 +i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1] = 8321. But is that correct?\n\nLet me recap the steps again to make sure:\n\nWe started with the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z\u00b2 - 2z +2). Then we factored each quadratic term as (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes the product over all z^13=1 of (z - (1 +i))*(z - (1 -i)). Which is equal to [product over z (z - (1 +i))] * [product over z (z - (1 -i))]. The product over z (z - a) where z ranges over all roots of z^13 -1 is the value of the polynomial z^13 -1 evaluated at a. Wait, hold on, actually, the product over (x - z) where z^13 =1 is x^13 -1. Therefore, the product over z (z - a) is the same as evaluating the polynomial (x^13 -1) at x = a, but replacing x with z? Wait, maybe I got confused here.\n\nWait, actually, let me clarify. Let me think of the product over all roots z of (z - a). If the roots z are the roots of the polynomial P(x) = x^13 -1, then the product over (z - a) where z ranges over the roots is equal to P(a) / leading coefficient? Wait, no, actually, more precisely, the product over (x - z) for all roots z of P(x) is equal to P(x). Therefore, if we set x = a, then the product over (a - z) is equal to P(a). But here, the product over (z - a) is the same as (-1)^{13} times the product over (a - z). Since there are 13 roots, so the product over (z - a) = (-1)^13 * product over (a - z) = - product over (a - z). Therefore, product over (z - a) = - (a^13 -1). Because product over (a - z) is P(a) = a^13 -1. Therefore, product over (z - a) = - (a^13 -1). Therefore, the product over (z - (1 +i)) is - [ (1 +i)^13 -1 ] and similarly product over (z - (1 -i)) is - [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ]\n\nTherefore, the total product is [ - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ]\n\nWait, so the product over all z (z - (1 +i))*(z - (1 -i)) is equal to [product (z - (1 +i))]*[product (z - (1 -i))] = [ - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ]\n\nWait, so actually, the product is equal to ( (1 +i)^13 -1 )*( (1 -i)^13 -1 ), which is exactly what I computed earlier. So that part is correct. So then the total product is indeed 8321. Therefore, the remainder mod 1000 is 321.\n\nHmm, but wait, but let me check if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the sign when computing the product over (z - a). Let me double-check that step.\n\nSuppose P(x) = x^13 -1. The roots are the 13th roots of unity. The product over (x - z) for all roots z is P(x). Therefore, if I set x = a, then the product over (a - z) = P(a) = a^13 -1. Therefore, the product over (z - a) = product over ( - (a - z) ) = (-1)^13 product over (a - z) = - (a^13 -1). Therefore, yes, product over (z - a) = - (a^13 -1). Therefore, the product over (z - (1 +i)) is - [ (1 +i)^13 -1 ] and similarly for (1 -i). Therefore, when multiplying them together, the two negatives multiply to a positive, so the product is [ ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] which is exactly the same as before. So that step is correct.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the product is 8321, so mod 1000 is 321. But let me confirm once again with another approach, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute the product. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me see if I can write this as a product over k of (something). Maybe notice that \u03c9^{2k} = (\u03c9^k)^2, so the term is 2 -2\u03c9^k + (\u03c9^k)^2. Let me denote x = \u03c9^k. Then each term is 2 -2x +x\u00b2. So the product is over all x^13 =1 (since \u03c9^k are the roots), so the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x +2). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that x^13 -1 = (x -1)(x - \u03c9)...(x - \u03c9^{12}), so the product over (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 -1. But in this case, the product is over (x\u00b2 -2x +2), so perhaps we can relate this to some polynomial evaluated at certain points?\n\nAlternatively, note that x\u00b2 - 2x +2 = (x - (1 +i))(x - (1 -i)), so as before, the product over all x^13=1 of (x - (1 +i))(x - (1 -i)) which is the same as before. So I think my first approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the product modulo 1000 directly? But that seems difficult. Alternatively, maybe compute 8321 mod 1000. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, 8321-8000=321. So 321 is the remainder.\n\nWait but let me make sure that 8321 is correct. Let me recompute (1 +i)^13 and (1 -i)^13 again:\n\nWe know (1 +i)^2 = 2i. Then (1 +i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4. (1 +i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16. (1 +i)^12 = (1 +i)^8*(1 +i)^4 = 16*(-4) = -64. Then (1 +i)^13 = (1 +i)^12*(1 +i) = -64*(1 +i) = -64 -64i. Therefore, (1 +i)^13 -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i. Similarly, (1 -i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i. Multiply them together:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096 = 8321. Yes, that's correct. So 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321. \n\nWait, but hold on. The problem states \"the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000.\" So unless there's a miscalculation I haven't spotted, the answer should be 321. Hmm, but let me check if there's an alternative interpretation.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\", but when k=0, \u03c9^0 =1, so the term is 2 -2(1) +1^2 = 2 -2 +1 =1. So that term is 1, so the product is 1 multiplied by the rest. But in my calculation, when I took the product over all 13 roots of unity, including z=1, so the product would include (1\u00b2 -2*1 +2)=1 -2 +2=1, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the step where I said the product over (z - (1 +i)) is - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ). Let me check with z=1. Let me take a simple case. Let me suppose I have a polynomial P(x) = (x - z1)(x - z2)...(x - zn). Then the product over (zi - a) would be P(a) with a sign? Wait, if P(x) = product_{i=1 to n} (x - zi), then product_{i=1 to n} (zi - a) = product_{i=1 to n} (zi -a) = product_{i=1 to n} ( - (a - zi) ) = (-1)^n product_{i=1 to n} (a - zi) = (-1)^n P(a). \n\nTherefore, in our case, the polynomial is P(x)=x^13 -1, so product over (zi - a) where zi are roots of P(x) is (-1)^13 * P(a) = - (a^13 -1). So yes, that formula is correct. Therefore, the product over (z - a) for all roots z of P(x)=x^13 -1 is indeed - (a^13 -1). Therefore, my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 321. Wait, but let me check if 8321 is actually the correct product. Let me see, perhaps compute the product in another way.\n\nAlternatively, note that (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) can be written as (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Let me consider that expression as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me set x = \u03c9^k. Then the term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. The product over all x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 -2x +2). Hmm, so perhaps the product is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and x\u00b2 -2x +2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps evaluate the product over roots of x^13 -1 of (x\u00b2 -2x +2).\n\nAlternatively, notice that the product over x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 -2x +2) = Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} -2\u03c9^k +2). Wait, but that's exactly the product given in the problem. So my previous approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider logarithms? Probably not necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product can be related to cyclotomic polynomials. Let me think. The polynomial x^13 -1 factors as (x -1)\u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is irreducible over the integers. However, I don't see an immediate connection here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product is equal to the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points. For instance, if I can find a polynomial Q(x) such that Q(x) = Product_{k=0}^{12} (x - (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})), but that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that the expression 2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} can be rewritten as 2 -2\u03c9^k + (\u03c9^k)^2. Let me set y = \u03c9^k, then the term is y\u00b2 -2y +2. So the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 -2y +2). So that is the same as Product_{y^13=1} (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2).\n\nAlternatively, consider that the product over all roots y of y^13 -1 of (y\u00b2 -2y +2) is equal to the resultant of y^13 -1 and y\u00b2 -2y +2, but I might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the product as the value of the polynomial P(y) = y^13 -1 evaluated at the roots of y\u00b2 -2y +2 =0? Wait, maybe via some property?\n\nAlternatively, note that if we have a function f(y) = y\u00b2 -2y +2, then the product over all roots y of y^13 -1 of f(y) is equal to the resultant of y^13 -1 and f(y). The resultant can be computed as the product of f(y) over all roots y of y^13 -1, which is exactly what we have. The resultant of two polynomials can also be computed as the determinant of their Sylvester matrix, but that might be tedious here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use logarithms and properties of roots of unity. But perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the product numerically for a specific root and see? Wait, but since the product is over all roots, unless the expression is symmetric, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, let me check with small primes. Wait, but 8321 mod 1000 is 321. Let me see, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8.321, so yes, remainder 321. Alternatively, perhaps there is an error in assuming the product is [(1 +i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1]. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the step where I said the product over (z - (1 +i)) for all z^13 =1 is equal to -[(1 +i)^13 -1]. That's correct because product_{z}(z - a) = - (a^13 -1). Therefore, the product over (z - (1 +i)) is - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ), and similarly for the other term, so multiplying them gives [ - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ]\n\nYes, so that's correct. Therefore, the product is indeed 8321, so modulo 1000 is 321. Therefore, I think the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check with another angle. Let me compute (1 +i)^13:\n\n(1 +i)^1 =1 +i\n\n(1 +i)^2 = 2i\n\n(1 +i)^3 = 2i*(1 +i)=2i +2i\u00b2=2i -2= -2 +2i\n\n(1 +i)^4= (-2 +2i)(1 +i)= -2(1 +i) +2i(1 +i)= -2 -2i +2i +2i\u00b2= -2 -2i +2i -2= -4\n\n(1 +i)^5= -4*(1 +i)= -4 -4i\n\n(1 +i)^6= (-4 -4i)(1 +i)= -4(1 +i) -4i(1 +i)= -4 -4i -4i -4i\u00b2= -4 -8i +4= 0 -8i= -8i\n\nWait, hold on, that contradicts previous calculations. Wait, (1 +i)^4 is -4. Then (1 +i)^5 is (1 +i)^4*(1 +i)= -4*(1 +i)= -4 -4i. Then (1 +i)^6 = (1 +i)^5*(1 +i) = (-4 -4i)(1 +i) = -4*(1 +i) -4i*(1 +i) = -4 -4i -4i -4i\u00b2 = -4 -8i +4 = (-4 +4) + (-8i) = 0 -8i = -8i. Hmm, so (1 +i)^6 = -8i. Then (1 +i)^7 = (1 +i)^6*(1 +i)= -8i*(1 +i)= -8i -8i\u00b2= -8i +8= 8 -8i\n\n(1 +i)^8 = (8 -8i)(1 +i)=8(1 +i) -8i(1 +i)=8 +8i -8i -8i\u00b2=8 +0i +8=16\n\nWait, so (1 +i)^8=16? Wait, but 16 is real. Then (1 +i)^8=16? Wait, but 16 is 2^4, but (1 +i)^8 is (2i)^4 = (2)^4*(i^4)=16*1=16, yes. So that matches.\n\nThen (1 +i)^9 = 16*(1 +i) =16 +16i\n\n(1 +i)^10 = (16 +16i)(1 +i)=16*(1 +i) +16i*(1 +i)=16 +16i +16i +16i\u00b2=16 +32i -16= 32i\n\n(1 +i)^11=32i*(1 +i)=32i +32i\u00b2=32i -32= -32 +32i\n\n(1 +i)^12= (-32 +32i)(1 +i)= -32(1 +i) +32i(1 +i)= -32 -32i +32i +32i\u00b2= -32 +0i -32= -64\n\n(1 +i)^13 = -64*(1 +i)= -64 -64i. Which matches previous results. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13:\n\nLet me compute (1 -i)^1 to 13:\n\n(1 -i)^1 =1 -i\n\n(1 -i)^2=1 -2i +i\u00b2=1 -2i -1= -2i\n\n(1 -i)^3= -2i*(1 -i)= -2i +2i\u00b2= -2i -2\n\n(1 -i)^4= (-2 -2i)(1 -i)= -2(1 -i) -2i(1 -i)= -2 +2i -2i +2i\u00b2= -2 +0i -2= -4\n\n(1 -i)^5= -4*(1 -i)= -4 +4i\n\n(1 -i)^6= (-4 +4i)(1 -i)= -4(1 -i) +4i(1 -i)= -4 +4i +4i -4i\u00b2= -4 +8i +4= 0 +8i=8i\n\n(1 -i)^7=8i*(1 -i)=8i -8i\u00b2=8i +8=8 +8i\n\n(1 -i)^8=(8 +8i)(1 -i)=8(1 -i)+8i(1 -i)=8 -8i +8i -8i\u00b2=8 +0i +8=16\n\n(1 -i)^9=16*(1 -i)=16 -16i\n\n(1 -i)^10=(16 -16i)(1 -i)=16(1 -i) -16i(1 -i)=16 -16i -16i +16i\u00b2=16 -32i -16= -32i\n\n(1 -i)^11= -32i*(1 -i)= -32i +32i\u00b2= -32i -32\n\n(1 -i)^12=(-32 -32i)(1 -i)= -32(1 -i) -32i(1 -i)= -32 +32i -32i +32i\u00b2= -32 +0i -32= -64\n\n(1 -i)^13= -64*(1 -i)= -64 +64i\n\nTherefore, yes, (1 -i)^13 is indeed -64 +64i, so (1 -i)^13 -1 is -65 +64i. Therefore, the product is indeed (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)=8321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nTherefore, after verifying all steps multiple times, I think the answer is 321. I don't see any miscalculations here. Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{321}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the product of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) for k from 0 to 12, where \u03c9 is a primitive 13th root of unity, and then find the remainder when that product is divided by 1000. Hmm, roots of unity problems can be tricky, but maybe I can use some properties of cyclotomic polynomials or something like that.\n\nFirst, let me recall that since \u03c9 is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \u03c9^13 = 1. Also, the minimal polynomial for \u03c9 is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) = x\u00b9\u00b2 + x\u00b9\u00b9 + ... + x + 1. Since \u03c9 \u2260 1, it's a primitive root, so it's a root of this polynomial.\n\nThe product given is from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me see if I can manipulate the expression inside the product to make it more manageable. Let me consider each term:\n\n2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}\n\nHmm, maybe factor out a 2? But that might not help much. Alternatively, notice that \u03c9^{2k} is (\u03c9^k)^2, so maybe substitute z = \u03c9^k, then each term becomes 2 - 2z + z\u00b2. Wait, so each term is a quadratic in z. Let me write that:\n\nFor each k, term is z\u00b2 - 2z + 2, where z = \u03c9^k.\n\nTherefore, the product over all k from 0 to 12 of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) where z = \u03c9^k. Since \u03c9^0 = 1, so when k=0, z=1.\n\nSo the entire product is the product over all 13th roots of unity (including 1) of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). Except, but wait, the roots of unity are the solutions to z\u00b9\u00b3 = 1, so the product over all z^13 =1 of (z\u00b2 - 2z +2). But actually, since we are taking the product over all \u03c9^k for k from 0 to 12, which are exactly the 13th roots of unity. So the product is the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2).\n\nTherefore, this product can be written as the product over all roots z of z\u00b9\u00b3 -1 =0 of (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2). Hmm, but maybe there's a way to relate this product to the polynomial z\u00b9\u00b3 -1?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider evaluating some polynomial at certain points. Let me think. The product over (z - a_i) where a_i are roots of some polynomial is related to the value of that polynomial. But here the factors are quadratic in z. Maybe I can think of it as evaluating another polynomial?\n\nAlternatively, note that the product over (z\u00b2 - 2z + 2) for all 13th roots z of unity is equal to the product over ( (z - \u03b1)(z - \u03b2) ) where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the roots of the quadratic equation x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 =0. Let me compute the roots of x\u00b2 - 2x + 2 = 0. Using quadratic formula:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nSo the roots are 1 + i and 1 - i. Therefore, each term (z\u00b2 - 2z +2) factors as (z - (1+i))(z - (1 - i)). Therefore, the entire product over all z being 13th roots of unity would be the product over all z of (z - (1+i))(z - (1 - i)).\n\nTherefore, the product is equal to [Product_{z^13=1} (z - (1 + i))] * [Product_{z^13=1} (z - (1 - i))]\n\nSo each of these products is the value of the polynomial P(x) = Product_{z^13=1} (x - z) evaluated at x =1 + i and x =1 -i respectively. But the polynomial Product_{z^13=1} (x - z) is just x\u00b9\u00b3 -1, because the roots of x\u00b9\u00b3 -1 are exactly the 13th roots of unity. Wait, but actually, the product over (x - z) where z^13 =1 is x\u00b9\u00b3 -1. Therefore, substituting x =1 + i gives (1 + i)^13 -1, and similarly for x=1 -i gives (1 -i)^13 -1. Therefore, the total product is [(1 + i)^13 -1] * [(1 -i)^13 -1]\n\nTherefore, the original product is equal to [(1 + i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1]. So now I need to compute this expression and then find its value modulo 1000.\n\nHmm, okay. Let me compute (1 + i)^13 first. Since 1 + i is a complex number, perhaps it's easier to write it in polar form. The modulus of 1 + i is sqrt(1^2 +1^2)=sqrt(2), and its angle (argument) is \u03c0/4 radians. So 1 + i = sqrt(2) e^{i\u03c0/4}. Therefore, (1 + i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{i*(13\u03c0/4)}. Similarly for (1 - i), which has modulus sqrt(2) and angle -\u03c0/4, so (1 - i)^13 = (sqrt(2))^13 * e^{-i*(13\u03c0/4)}.\n\nLet me compute (sqrt(2))^13 first. sqrt(2) is 2^{1/2}, so (sqrt(2))^13 = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So that term is 64\u221a2.\n\nNow, the angle for (1 + i)^13 is 13\u03c0/4. Let me reduce that angle modulo 2\u03c0. 13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is (13/4)/2 =13/8, so 13\u03c0/4 = 2\u03c0*(1) + 5\u03c0/4. So the angle is equivalent to 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, the angle for (1 - i)^13 is -13\u03c0/4, which is equivalent to -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = ( -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 )= 3\u03c0/4. Wait, let me check that again.\n\nWait, for (1 -i)^13: angle is -\u03c0/4, so 13*(-\u03c0/4)= -13\u03c0/4. To add multiples of 2\u03c0 to get it within 0 to 2\u03c0: -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = (-13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0/4. So yes, angle is 3\u03c0/4. Alternatively, since angles are modulo 2\u03c0, so -13\u03c0/4 is the same as -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = ( -13\u03c0 + 16\u03c0 ) /4 = 3\u03c0/4.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 [cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)] and (1 - i)^13 = 64\u221a2 [cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)]\n\nLet me compute each of these:\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, so (1 + i)^13 = 64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) + i (-\u221a2/2) ] = 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)(1 + i) = 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2)*(1 +i)\n\nSimplify that: \u221a2 * \u221a2 is 2, so 64*( -2/2)*(1 +i) = 64*(-1)*(1 +i) = -64(1 +i)\n\nSimilarly, (1 - i)^13 is 64\u221a2 [cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4) ] = 64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) + i (\u221a2/2) ]\n\nSo that's 64\u221a2*(-\u221a2/2 + i\u221a2/2 ) = 64\u221a2*(\u221a2/2)( -1 +i ) = 64*( -1 +i )*( (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 ) ?\n\nWait, let me do step by step again:\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(3\u03c0/4)=\u221a2/2. Therefore, the expression is:\n\n64\u221a2 [ (-\u221a2/2) + i*(\u221a2/2) ] = 64\u221a2 * [ (-\u221a2/2)(1 - i) ] ?\n\nWait, actually, let's compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (\u221a2 * -\u221a2)/2 = 64*(-2)/2 = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSecond term: 64\u221a2 * (i\u221a2/2 ) = 64*(\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 *i = 64*(2)/2 *i = 64i.\n\nTherefore, altogether, (1 - i)^13 = -64 + 64i.\n\nWait, so:\n\n(1 + i)^13 = -64(1 +i) = -64 -64i.\n\n(1 -i)^13 = -64 +64i.\n\nTherefore, (1 + i)^13 -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13 -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i\n\nTherefore, the product is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let me compute that.\n\nMultiply the two complex conjugates: (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2, but here it's actually ( (-65) + (-64i) ) and ( -65 +64i ). Wait, actually, more precisely:\n\nLet me write them as ( -65 -64i )*( -65 +64i ). Let me compute this as:\n\nLet me denote A = -65, B = -64i. Then the first term is A + B, second is A - B. Wait no: the second term is -65 +64i, so actually, perhaps better to see as:\n\nLet me compute ( (-65) -64i )*( (-65) +64i ) = [ (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 ] because (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2. Wait, but here the terms are ( -65 -64i ) and ( -65 +64i ). Let me check:\n\nLet me set a = -65, b =64i. Then the product is (a - b)(a + b) = a\u00b2 - b\u00b2.\n\nSo:\n\na\u00b2 = (-65)^2 = 4225\n\nb\u00b2 = (64i)^2 = 64\u00b2 * i\u00b2 = 4096*(-1) = -4096\n\nThus, the product is 4225 - (-4096) = 4225 +4096 = 8321.\n\nWait, so the product is 8321?\n\nWait, that's a real number, which makes sense because the two factors are complex conjugates, so their product is real.\n\nTherefore, the original product is 8321. Wait, but hold on. Wait, let me verify again step by step.\n\nFirst, (1 + i)^13 -1 = -65 -64i, as computed above. (1 -i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i. Then multiplying these two:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst: (-65)(-65) = 4225\n\nSecond: (-65)(64i) = -4160i\n\nThird: (-64i)(-65) = +4160i\n\nFourth: (-64i)(64i) = -4096 i\u00b2 = -4096*(-1) = +4096\n\nAdding all terms: 4225 -4160i +4160i +4096 = 4225 +4096 = 8321. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is 8321. Therefore, the remainder when divided by 1000 is 8321 mod 1000. Since 8000 is divisible by 1000, 8321 -8000 = 321, so the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check again if all steps are correct because 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321, but maybe I made a mistake in earlier steps?\n\nWait let me check the calculation of (1 +i)^13 again. Let me compute (1 +i)^13 step by step using binomial theorem? Hmm, that might be tedious but perhaps better to confirm with another method.\n\nAlternatively, since (1 +i)^2 = 2i, so (1 +i)^2 = 2i. Therefore, (1 +i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4, (1 +i)^8 = (-4)^2 =16, then (1 +i)^12 = (1 +i)^8 * (1 +i)^4 = 16*(-4) = -64, and then (1 +i)^13 = (1 +i)^12*(1 +i) = (-64)(1 +i) = -64 -64i. Which matches previous result. Similarly for (1 -i)^13:\n\n(1 -i)^2 = -2i, so (1 -i)^4 = (-2i)^2 = -4, (1 -i)^8 = (-4)^2 =16, (1 -i)^12 = (1 -i)^8*(1 -i)^4 = 16*(-4) = -64, then (1 -i)^13 = (1 -i)^12*(1 -i) = (-64)(1 -i) = -64 +64i. So that also matches. Therefore, the previous steps are correct.\n\nTherefore, the product is indeed 8321. Then 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 + 321, so remainder is 321. Therefore, the answer should be 321 mod 1000.\n\nWait, but hold on, the problem says \"the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000\". So 8321 mod 1000 is 321. So that's the answer?\n\nBut let me check again. Wait, but wait, the original problem is the product over k from 0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}), and we transformed that into [(1 +i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1] = 8321. But is that correct?\n\nLet me recap the steps again to make sure:\n\nWe started with the product over all 13th roots of unity z of (z\u00b2 - 2z +2). Then we factored each quadratic term as (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)). Therefore, the entire product becomes the product over all z^13=1 of (z - (1 +i))*(z - (1 -i)). Which is equal to [product over z (z - (1 +i))] * [product over z (z - (1 -i))]. The product over z (z - a) where z ranges over all roots of z^13 -1 is the value of the polynomial z^13 -1 evaluated at a. Wait, hold on, actually, the product over (x - z) where z^13 =1 is x^13 -1. Therefore, the product over z (z - a) is the same as evaluating the polynomial (x^13 -1) at x = a, but replacing x with z? Wait, maybe I got confused here.\n\nWait, actually, let me clarify. Let me think of the product over all roots z of (z - a). If the roots z are the roots of the polynomial P(x) = x^13 -1, then the product over (z - a) where z ranges over the roots is equal to P(a) / leading coefficient? Wait, no, actually, more precisely, the product over (x - z) for all roots z of P(x) is equal to P(x). Therefore, if we set x = a, then the product over (a - z) is equal to P(a). But here, the product over (z - a) is the same as (-1)^{13} times the product over (a - z). Since there are 13 roots, so the product over (z - a) = (-1)^13 * product over (a - z) = - product over (a - z). Therefore, product over (z - a) = - (a^13 -1). Because product over (a - z) is P(a) = a^13 -1. Therefore, product over (z - a) = - (a^13 -1). Therefore, the product over (z - (1 +i)) is - [ (1 +i)^13 -1 ] and similarly product over (z - (1 -i)) is - [ (1 -i)^13 -1 ]\n\nTherefore, the total product is [ - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ]\n\nWait, so the product over all z (z - (1 +i))*(z - (1 -i)) is equal to [product (z - (1 +i))]*[product (z - (1 -i))] = [ - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ]\n\nWait, so actually, the product is equal to ( (1 +i)^13 -1 )*( (1 -i)^13 -1 ), which is exactly what I computed earlier. So that part is correct. So then the total product is indeed 8321. Therefore, the remainder mod 1000 is 321.\n\nHmm, but wait, but let me check if that's the case. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the sign when computing the product over (z - a). Let me double-check that step.\n\nSuppose P(x) = x^13 -1. The roots are the 13th roots of unity. The product over (x - z) for all roots z is P(x). Therefore, if I set x = a, then the product over (a - z) = P(a) = a^13 -1. Therefore, the product over (z - a) = product over ( - (a - z) ) = (-1)^13 product over (a - z) = - (a^13 -1). Therefore, yes, product over (z - a) = - (a^13 -1). Therefore, the product over (z - (1 +i)) is - [ (1 +i)^13 -1 ] and similarly for (1 -i). Therefore, when multiplying them together, the two negatives multiply to a positive, so the product is [ ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] which is exactly the same as before. So that step is correct.\n\nTherefore, my conclusion is that the product is 8321, so mod 1000 is 321. But let me confirm once again with another approach, perhaps?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another way to compute the product. Let me think again.\n\nSuppose we have the product over k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}). Let me see if I can write this as a product over k of (something). Maybe notice that \u03c9^{2k} = (\u03c9^k)^2, so the term is 2 -2\u03c9^k + (\u03c9^k)^2. Let me denote x = \u03c9^k. Then each term is 2 -2x +x\u00b2. So the product is over all x^13 =1 (since \u03c9^k are the roots), so the product over x of (x\u00b2 - 2x +2). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that x^13 -1 = (x -1)(x - \u03c9)...(x - \u03c9^{12}), so the product over (x - \u03c9^k) is x^13 -1. But in this case, the product is over (x\u00b2 -2x +2), so perhaps we can relate this to some polynomial evaluated at certain points?\n\nAlternatively, note that x\u00b2 - 2x +2 = (x - (1 +i))(x - (1 -i)), so as before, the product over all x^13=1 of (x - (1 +i))(x - (1 -i)) which is the same as before. So I think my first approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the product modulo 1000 directly? But that seems difficult. Alternatively, maybe compute 8321 mod 1000. 8321 divided by 1000 is 8*1000 = 8000, 8321-8000=321. So 321 is the remainder.\n\nWait but let me make sure that 8321 is correct. Let me recompute (1 +i)^13 and (1 -i)^13 again:\n\nWe know (1 +i)^2 = 2i. Then (1 +i)^4 = (2i)^2 = -4. (1 +i)^8 = (-4)^2 = 16. (1 +i)^12 = (1 +i)^8*(1 +i)^4 = 16*(-4) = -64. Then (1 +i)^13 = (1 +i)^12*(1 +i) = -64*(1 +i) = -64 -64i. Therefore, (1 +i)^13 -1 = -64 -64i -1 = -65 -64i. Similarly, (1 -i)^13 -1 = -65 +64i. Multiply them together:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)^2 - (64i)^2 = 4225 - (64^2)(i^2) = 4225 - (4096)(-1) = 4225 +4096 = 8321. Yes, that's correct. So 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321. \n\nWait, but hold on. The problem states \"the remainder when [...] is divided by 1000.\" So unless there's a miscalculation I haven't spotted, the answer should be 321. Hmm, but let me check if there's an alternative interpretation.\n\nWait, the problem says \"the product from k=0 to 12 of (2 - 2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})\", but when k=0, \u03c9^0 =1, so the term is 2 -2(1) +1^2 = 2 -2 +1 =1. So that term is 1, so the product is 1 multiplied by the rest. But in my calculation, when I took the product over all 13 roots of unity, including z=1, so the product would include (1\u00b2 -2*1 +2)=1 -2 +2=1, so that's consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the step where I said the product over (z - (1 +i)) is - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ). Let me check with z=1. Let me take a simple case. Let me suppose I have a polynomial P(x) = (x - z1)(x - z2)...(x - zn). Then the product over (zi - a) would be P(a) with a sign? Wait, if P(x) = product_{i=1 to n} (x - zi), then product_{i=1 to n} (zi - a) = product_{i=1 to n} (zi -a) = product_{i=1 to n} ( - (a - zi) ) = (-1)^n product_{i=1 to n} (a - zi) = (-1)^n P(a). \n\nTherefore, in our case, the polynomial is P(x)=x^13 -1, so product over (zi - a) where zi are roots of P(x) is (-1)^13 * P(a) = - (a^13 -1). So yes, that formula is correct. Therefore, the product over (z - a) for all roots z of P(x)=x^13 -1 is indeed - (a^13 -1). Therefore, my calculation is correct.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 321. Wait, but let me check if 8321 is actually the correct product. Let me see, perhaps compute the product in another way.\n\nAlternatively, note that (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k}) can be written as (\u03c9^{2k} - 2\u03c9^k + 2). Let me consider that expression as a quadratic in \u03c9^k. Let me set x = \u03c9^k. Then the term is x\u00b2 - 2x + 2. The product over all x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 -2x +2). Hmm, so perhaps the product is equal to the resultant of x^13 -1 and x\u00b2 -2x +2? Not sure. Alternatively, perhaps evaluate the product over roots of x^13 -1 of (x\u00b2 -2x +2).\n\nAlternatively, notice that the product over x^13=1 of (x\u00b2 -2x +2) = Product_{k=0}^{12} (\u03c9^{2k} -2\u03c9^k +2). Wait, but that's exactly the product given in the problem. So my previous approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider logarithms? Probably not necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps note that the product can be related to cyclotomic polynomials. Let me think. The polynomial x^13 -1 factors as (x -1)\u03a6\u2081\u2083(x). Since \u03a6\u2081\u2083(x) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is irreducible over the integers. However, I don't see an immediate connection here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product is equal to the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points. For instance, if I can find a polynomial Q(x) such that Q(x) = Product_{k=0}^{12} (x - (2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k})), but that might not be helpful.\n\nAlternatively, note that the expression 2 -2\u03c9^k + \u03c9^{2k} can be rewritten as 2 -2\u03c9^k + (\u03c9^k)^2. Let me set y = \u03c9^k, then the term is y\u00b2 -2y +2. So the product over all y^13=1 of (y\u00b2 -2y +2). So that is the same as Product_{y^13=1} (y\u00b2 - 2y + 2).\n\nAlternatively, consider that the product over all roots y of y^13 -1 of (y\u00b2 -2y +2) is equal to the resultant of y^13 -1 and y\u00b2 -2y +2, but I might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of the product as the value of the polynomial P(y) = y^13 -1 evaluated at the roots of y\u00b2 -2y +2 =0? Wait, maybe via some property?\n\nAlternatively, note that if we have a function f(y) = y\u00b2 -2y +2, then the product over all roots y of y^13 -1 of f(y) is equal to the resultant of y^13 -1 and f(y). The resultant can be computed as the product of f(y) over all roots y of y^13 -1, which is exactly what we have. The resultant of two polynomials can also be computed as the determinant of their Sylvester matrix, but that might be tedious here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use logarithms and properties of roots of unity. But perhaps not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can compute the product numerically for a specific root and see? Wait, but since the product is over all roots, unless the expression is symmetric, it's hard.\n\nAlternatively, let me check with small primes. Wait, but 8321 mod 1000 is 321. Let me see, 8321 divided by 1000 is 8.321, so yes, remainder 321. Alternatively, perhaps there is an error in assuming the product is [(1 +i)^13 -1][(1 -i)^13 -1]. Let me think again.\n\nWait, in the step where I said the product over (z - (1 +i)) for all z^13 =1 is equal to -[(1 +i)^13 -1]. That's correct because product_{z}(z - a) = - (a^13 -1). Therefore, the product over (z - (1 +i)) is - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ), and similarly for the other term, so multiplying them gives [ - ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) ] * [ - ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ] = [ ( (1 +i)^13 -1 ) * ( (1 -i)^13 -1 ) ]\n\nYes, so that's correct. Therefore, the product is indeed 8321, so modulo 1000 is 321. Therefore, I think the answer is 321.\n\nWait, but let me check with another angle. Let me compute (1 +i)^13:\n\n(1 +i)^1 =1 +i\n\n(1 +i)^2 = 2i\n\n(1 +i)^3 = 2i*(1 +i)=2i +2i\u00b2=2i -2= -2 +2i\n\n(1 +i)^4= (-2 +2i)(1 +i)= -2(1 +i) +2i(1 +i)= -2 -2i +2i +2i\u00b2= -2 -2i +2i -2= -4\n\n(1 +i)^5= -4*(1 +i)= -4 -4i\n\n(1 +i)^6= (-4 -4i)(1 +i)= -4(1 +i) -4i(1 +i)= -4 -4i -4i -4i\u00b2= -4 -8i +4= 0 -8i= -8i\n\nWait, hold on, that contradicts previous calculations. Wait, (1 +i)^4 is -4. Then (1 +i)^5 is (1 +i)^4*(1 +i)= -4*(1 +i)= -4 -4i. Then (1 +i)^6 = (1 +i)^5*(1 +i) = (-4 -4i)(1 +i) = -4*(1 +i) -4i*(1 +i) = -4 -4i -4i -4i\u00b2 = -4 -8i +4 = (-4 +4) + (-8i) = 0 -8i = -8i. Hmm, so (1 +i)^6 = -8i. Then (1 +i)^7 = (1 +i)^6*(1 +i)= -8i*(1 +i)= -8i -8i\u00b2= -8i +8= 8 -8i\n\n(1 +i)^8 = (8 -8i)(1 +i)=8(1 +i) -8i(1 +i)=8 +8i -8i -8i\u00b2=8 +0i +8=16\n\nWait, so (1 +i)^8=16? Wait, but 16 is real. Then (1 +i)^8=16? Wait, but 16 is 2^4, but (1 +i)^8 is (2i)^4 = (2)^4*(i^4)=16*1=16, yes. So that matches.\n\nThen (1 +i)^9 = 16*(1 +i) =16 +16i\n\n(1 +i)^10 = (16 +16i)(1 +i)=16*(1 +i) +16i*(1 +i)=16 +16i +16i +16i\u00b2=16 +32i -16= 32i\n\n(1 +i)^11=32i*(1 +i)=32i +32i\u00b2=32i -32= -32 +32i\n\n(1 +i)^12= (-32 +32i)(1 +i)= -32(1 +i) +32i(1 +i)= -32 -32i +32i +32i\u00b2= -32 +0i -32= -64\n\n(1 +i)^13 = -64*(1 +i)= -64 -64i. Which matches previous results. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, (1 -i)^13:\n\nLet me compute (1 -i)^1 to 13:\n\n(1 -i)^1 =1 -i\n\n(1 -i)^2=1 -2i +i\u00b2=1 -2i -1= -2i\n\n(1 -i)^3= -2i*(1 -i)= -2i +2i\u00b2= -2i -2\n\n(1 -i)^4= (-2 -2i)(1 -i)= -2(1 -i) -2i(1 -i)= -2 +2i -2i +2i\u00b2= -2 +0i -2= -4\n\n(1 -i)^5= -4*(1 -i)= -4 +4i\n\n(1 -i)^6= (-4 +4i)(1 -i)= -4(1 -i) +4i(1 -i)= -4 +4i +4i -4i\u00b2= -4 +8i +4= 0 +8i=8i\n\n(1 -i)^7=8i*(1 -i)=8i -8i\u00b2=8i +8=8 +8i\n\n(1 -i)^8=(8 +8i)(1 -i)=8(1 -i)+8i(1 -i)=8 -8i +8i -8i\u00b2=8 +0i +8=16\n\n(1 -i)^9=16*(1 -i)=16 -16i\n\n(1 -i)^10=(16 -16i)(1 -i)=16(1 -i) -16i(1 -i)=16 -16i -16i +16i\u00b2=16 -32i -16= -32i\n\n(1 -i)^11= -32i*(1 -i)= -32i +32i\u00b2= -32i -32\n\n(1 -i)^12=(-32 -32i)(1 -i)= -32(1 -i) -32i(1 -i)= -32 +32i -32i +32i\u00b2= -32 +0i -32= -64\n\n(1 -i)^13= -64*(1 -i)= -64 +64i\n\nTherefore, yes, (1 -i)^13 is indeed -64 +64i, so (1 -i)^13 -1 is -65 +64i. Therefore, the product is indeed (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)=8321. So, 8321 mod 1000 is 321.\n\nTherefore, after verifying all steps multiple times, I think the answer is 321. I don't see any miscalculations here. Therefore, the remainder when the product is divided by 1000 is 321.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{321}\n\n\nGiven \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity, we need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, we note that each term in the product can be written as \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + (\\omega^k)^2\\). Let \\(z = \\omega^k\\), so each term becomes \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity. Hmm, roots of unity often relate to cyclotomic polynomials, so maybe that's a path here. Let me start by recalling some properties of roots of unity and cyclotomic polynomials.\n\nFirst, since \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), and the minimal polynomial over the integers is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \\(\\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \\dots + x + 1\\). But the problem is about a product over all the roots, so maybe I can express this product in terms of some polynomial evaluated at specific points?\n\nLet me consider the general term in the product: \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). Let's see if I can rewrite this expression in a more manageable form. Let me denote \\(z = \\omega^k\\). Since \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, each \\(z\\) will also be a 13th root of unity (except when \\(k=13\\), but since k goes up to 12, we cover all except 1, but actually when k=0, z=1). So for each term, substituting \\(z = \\omega^k\\), we have the expression \\(2 - 2z + z^2\\). Therefore, the entire product is \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (2 - 2z + z^2)\\), except when z=1? Wait, actually, when k=0, z=1, so the term is \\(2 - 2(1) + 1^2 = 1\\). So the product over k=0 to 12 is the product over all 13th roots of unity of \\(2 - 2z + z^2\\), except maybe I need to check that.\n\nWait, actually, since \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root, the terms \\(\\omega^k\\) for k from 0 to 12 are exactly all the 13th roots of unity. So the product is indeed over all 13th roots of unity. So the product is \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (2 - 2z + z^2)\\). But how do I compute this?\n\nHmm, perhaps I can relate this product to the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points. Let me think: if I have a polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, that would be \\(x^{13} - 1 = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \\omega^k)\\). But here, the product is over \\(2 - 2z + z^2\\), so maybe I can manipulate this expression into a form that relates to such polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for each z, \\(2 - 2z + z^2\\) can be rewritten. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute \\(2 - 2z + z^2 = z^2 - 2z + 2\\). Hmm, this quadratic in z. Let me see if this factors or has roots. The discriminant is \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), so roots at \\(z = [2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}]/2 = 1 \\pm i\\). So complex roots, but maybe not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that \\(z^2 - 2z + 2 = (z - 1)^2 + 1\\). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe consider evaluating the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Since the product is over all roots of z^{13}=1, maybe we can express this as the resultant or something?\n\nAlternatively, consider that for a polynomial P(z), the product over all roots of Q(z) of P(z) is related to the resultant of Q and P. But I might be getting ahead of myself here.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the product as \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\) evaluated at each root z = \\(\\omega^k\\), so maybe the product is equal to the value of some resultant or another polynomial?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2) can be written as the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Let me denote this product as P. Then, since the roots of z^{13}=1 are all the 13th roots of unity, we can write this product as the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). \n\nTo compute such a product, perhaps use the fact that for a polynomial f(z), the product over f(z) evaluated at all roots of g(z)=0 is equal to the resultant of g and f, or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps consider that the product is equal to the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at a certain point.\n\nLet me consider that if we have a polynomial whose roots are the z such that z^{13}=1, then the product over (z^2 - 2z + 2) can be thought of as evaluating another polynomial at specific points. Let me think of the product as:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z^2 - 2z + 2) \\text{ where } z = \\omega^k\n\\]\n\nWait, but actually each term is a quadratic in z. Maybe I can think of this as the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Let me denote f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2. Then the product is \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} f(z)\\).\n\nThere's a formula for the product over roots of a polynomial of another function. Specifically, if we have a polynomial Q(z) with roots r_i, then the product over f(r_i) can be expressed as the resultant of Q and some other polynomial related to f. Alternatively, perhaps use logarithms, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, note that if Q(z) = z^{13} - 1, then the product \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} f(z)\\) is equal to the resultant of Q and f, but I might need to recall how resultants work. Alternatively, perhaps think of the product as the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at some point.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Let me consider that for a polynomial P(z) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z - \\omega^k) = z^{13} - 1. Wait, actually that's exactly the polynomial. But here, instead of (z - \\omega^k), we have (z^2 - 2z + 2) evaluated at each \\omega^k. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z + 2) is equal to the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z + 2). Let me think of this as the product over all roots of z^{13}=1 of f(z), where f(z) = z^2 - 2 z + 2.\n\nSo, the product over all roots of Q(z) = z^{13} - 1 of f(z) can be written as the resultant of Q(z) and f(z), but I need to recall the exact formula for that. Alternatively, perhaps use the concept that if we have two polynomials, then the product over f evaluated at roots of Q is equal to the resultant of Q and f divided by the leading coefficient of Q raised to the degree of f, or something like that. Maybe I need to look up the formula, but since I can't do that right now, perhaps think of an example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that if Q(z) = z^{13} - 1, then the product over all roots z of Q(z)=0 of f(z) is equal to the product over all z^{13}=1 of f(z). Let me think of f(z) as a quadratic, so f(z) = z^2 - 2 z + 2. Let me see:\n\nLet me consider that the product over all roots of Q(z)=0 of f(z) is equal to the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z + 2). Let me consider that this product can be written as the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - a)(z - b), where a and b are the roots of f(z) = 0. Since f(z) = z^2 - 2 z + 2, its roots are 1 \u00b1 i. Therefore, the product becomes:\n\nProduct_{z^{13}=1} (z - a)(z - b) = [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - a)] * [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - b)].\n\nSo, each of those products is the value of the polynomial Q(z) = z^{13} - 1 evaluated at z = a and z = b respectively. Because the product over (z - root) for all roots of Q is Q(z). Wait, actually, if I have a polynomial Q(z) with roots r_0, r_1,...,r_{n-1}, then the product over (z - r_k) is Q(z). But here, we are evaluating the product over (r_k - a) for each root r_k of Q. So that would be Q(a). Similarly, the product over (r_k - a) = Product_{k} (r_k - a) = Product_{k} (a - r_k) * (-1)^{n} where n is the degree. Wait, actually, the product_{k} (a - r_k) = Q(a). Since Q(z) = Product_{k} (z - r_k), so Q(a) = Product_{k} (a - r_k). Therefore, the product over (r_k - a) is (-1)^{13} Q(a). Since the degree is 13, which is odd, so that's -Q(a). Therefore, the total product is:\n\nProduct_{z^{13}=1} (z - a)(z - b) = [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - a)] * [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - b)] = [ -Q(a) ] * [ -Q(b) ] = Q(a) Q(b).\n\nBecause the product over (z - a) for all roots z of Q is Product_{z} (z - a) = (-1)^{13} Product_{z} (a - z) = - Q(a). Similarly for (z - b). Therefore, the total product is (-Q(a))(-Q(b)) = Q(a) Q(b).\n\nTherefore, the product we need is Q(a) Q(b), where Q(z) = z^{13} - 1, and a and b are the roots of f(z) = z^2 - 2 z + 2.\n\nSo, substituting, we have:\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = Product_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2 z + 2) = Q(a) Q(b) = (a^{13} - 1)(b^{13} - 1).\n\nSince Q(a) = a^{13} -1 and Q(b) = b^{13} -1.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing (a^{13} -1)(b^{13} -1), where a and b are the roots of z^2 - 2 z + 2 = 0. Let me compute a and b first.\n\nThe roots of z^2 - 2 z + 2 = 0 are:\n\nz = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nTherefore, a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i. Therefore, we need to compute (a^{13} -1)(b^{13} -1).\n\nFirst, compute a^{13} and b^{13}. Since a and b are complex conjugates, their powers will also be conjugates, so (a^{13} -1) and (b^{13} -1) are conjugates. Therefore, their product is |a^{13} -1|^2, but maybe it's easier to compute directly.\n\nAlternatively, note that a = 1 + i. Let me compute a^{13}. Let me write a in polar form. The modulus of a is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So a = sqrt(2) e^{i \u03c0/4}. Therefore, a^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i (13 * \u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, b = 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2), argument -\u03c0/4, so b^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i (13 * \u03c0/4)}.\n\nFirst, compute (sqrt(2))^{13} = (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nThen, the angle for a^{13} is 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute that modulo 2\u03c0. Since 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0). Wait, actually, 13 divided by 8 (since 2\u03c0 is a full circle, and \u03c0/4 increments per step). Wait, let me compute 13*(\u03c0/4):\n\n13*(\u03c0/4) = (12 +1)*(\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 3\u03c0 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, 13*(\u03c0/4) = (12*(\u03c0/4)) + \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 3\u03c0 is equal to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0), so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, the angle for a^{13} is 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, the angle for b^{13} is -13\u03c0/4. Let me compute that similarly:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = - (12\u03c0/4 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 2\u03c0 to get it within 0 to 2\u03c0: -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = -5\u03c0/4, which is equivalent to 2\u03c0 -5\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. Wait, maybe better to compute modulo 2\u03c0:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = ( -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 ) = 3\u03c0/4. Wait, that's not right. Wait, adding 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) to -13\u03c0/4 gives (-13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = (-5\u03c0/4). Hmm, maybe I should do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, -13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is -13/8, so the integer part is -2 (since -2*2\u03c0 = -4\u03c0, which is -8\u03c0/4, so -13\u03c0/4 - (-8\u03c0/4) = -5\u03c0/4. So angle is -5\u03c0/4, which is equivalent to -5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = 3\u03c0/4. Wait, so angle for b^{13} is 3\u03c0/4?\n\nWait, let me check again. The angle for b is -\u03c0/4. So multiplying by 13 gives angle -13\u03c0/4. To find an equivalent angle between 0 and 2\u03c0:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0*2 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. Yes, so angle is 3\u03c0/4. Therefore, a^{13} has angle 5\u03c0/4, and b^{13} has angle 3\u03c0/4.\n\nTherefore, a^{13} is modulus (sqrt(2))^{13} times e^{i5\u03c0/4}, and b^{13} is modulus (sqrt(2))^{13} times e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, a^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = (sqrt(2))^{13} * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, b^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13}*(cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)) = (sqrt(2))^{13}*(-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nWait, let me compute these terms:\n\nFirst, (sqrt(2))^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So:\n\na^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. So:\n\na^{13} = 64*sqrt(2) * ( -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i) ]\n\nMultiply sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) gives 2, so:\n\n= 64 * ( -2/2 (1 + i) ) = 64 * (-1 - i) = -64(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, for b^{13}:\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nThus:\n\nb^{13} = 64*sqrt(2) * ( -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 (1 - i) ]\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2:\n\n= 64*( -2/2 (1 - i) ) = 64*(-1 + i) = -64(1 - i)\n\nTherefore, a^{13} -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -65 -64i\n\nSimilarly, b^{13} -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -65 +64i\n\nTherefore, the product (a^{13} -1)(b^{13} -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)\n\nMultiply these two complex numbers:\n\nFirst, note that (x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2, but here it's ( -65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = [(-65)^2 - (64i)^2] ?\n\nWait, actually, let me compute step by step:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)(-65) + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i)\n\n= 65^2 + (-65*64i) + (64*65i) + (-64^2 i^2)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 65^2 = 4225\n\nSecond term: -65*64i\n\nThird term: +64*65i\n\nFourth term: - (64)^2 (i^2) = -4096*(-1) = +4096\n\nNotice that the second and third terms cancel each other because -65*64i +64*65i = 0. So those cross terms vanish.\n\nTherefore, total is 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n\nWait, 4225 + 4096: 4000 + 4000 = 8000, 225 + 96 = 321, so total 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product (a^{13} -1)(b^{13} -1) = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the original product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is equal to 8321. Then the problem asks for the remainder when this is divided by 1000. So compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\nDividing 8321 by 1000: 1000*8 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321. Therefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait a second, hold on. Let me confirm the steps again because sometimes complex calculations can lead to errors.\n\nFirst, let me verify the calculation of a^{13} and b^{13}:\n\nWe had a =1 + i, which is sqrt(2) e^{i pi/4}, so a^13 would be (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i (13 * pi/4)}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nAngle 13 * pi/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 3* pi + pi/4, which is 3pi + pi/4. Since angles are modulo 2pi, subtract 2pi: 3pi + pi/4 - 2pi = pi + pi/4 = 5pi/4. Correct. So angle is 5pi/4. So a^{13} is 64 sqrt(2) * (cos5pi/4 + i sin5pi/4) which is 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 -i sqrt(2)/2). Multiplying sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) gives 2, so 64 * (- (sqrt(2)/2 * sqrt(2)) ) = 64 * (- (2/2) ) = 64*(-1). Wait, hold on:\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the components step by step.\n\nCompute cos(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2.\n\nThus:\n\na^{13} = 64\u221a2 * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i*(-\u221a2/2) ]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst component: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (- (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the second component: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)i = same as above, so -64i.\n\nTherefore, total a^{13} = -64 -64i. Wait, hold on, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, in my previous step, I thought the terms were -64*(1 + i), but now I see:\n\nWait, cos(5pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, so the real part is:\n\n64\u221a2 * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-1) = 64*(2)/2*(-1) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is the same: 64\u221a2*(-sqrt(2)/2)i = -64i. So indeed, a^{13} = -64 -64i.\n\nWait, so my previous calculation had a mistake. I think I miscalculated earlier. Wait, so in my first calculation I thought:\n\na^{13} = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i) ]\n\nBut sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 is (2)/2 =1, so 64 * (-1)(1 +i) = -64(1 +i). Which is the same as -64 -64i. So that was correct. So then, a^{13} -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, b^{13}:\n\nb =1 -i, so angle -pi/4. So angle after multiplying by 13 is -13 pi/4. Adding 4 pi (since 2 pi is a full circle), so -13 pi/4 + 4 pi = (-13 pi/4 + 16 pi/4)= 3 pi/4. So angle 3 pi/4. So cos(3 pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3 pi/4)= sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, b^{13} =64\u221a2 [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nCalculates to:\n\nReal part: 64\u221a2*(-sqrt(2)/2)= -64, imaginary part: 64\u221a2*(sqrt(2)/2)i = +64i. So total b^{13} = -64 +64i. Therefore, b^{13} -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nTherefore, the product (a^{13} -1)(b^{13}-1) is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let me compute this again:\n\nFirst, expand the product:\n\n(-65)(-65) + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i)\n\nFirst term: 65^2 = 4225\n\nSecond term: -65*64i = -4160i\n\nThird term: +64*65i = +4160i\n\nFourth term: -64*64 i^2 = -4096*(-1) = +4096\n\nTherefore, adding all terms:\n\n4225 + ( -4160i +4160i ) + 4096 = 4225 + 0 + 4096 = 8321. So that's correct.\n\nSo the product is indeed 8321. Then 8321 divided by 1000: 8*1000 =8000, 8321 -8000 =321. Therefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check if I made a mistake in the very first step where I converted the original product into Q(a) Q(b). Let me verify that step again.\n\nThe original product is \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2 \\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\). Let me note that in my reasoning, I set z = \\omega^k, so the term becomes z^2 -2 z +2. Therefore, the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z^2 -2 z +2). Since \\(\\omega^k\\) for k from 0 to 12 are all roots of z^{13}=1, so yes, the product is over all roots z^{13}=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2). Then, using the formula that this product is equal to Q(a) Q(b), where Q(z)=z^{13}-1 and a,b are roots of z^2 -2 z +2 =0. \n\nWait, but let me verify with a simpler case. Let me take a smaller n, like n=1. Wait, but n=1 would be trivial. Let me try n=2. Suppose instead of 13th roots, take 2nd roots. Let me see if the formula holds. Suppose n=2, so the product over z^2=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2). The roots are z=1 and z=-1. The product would be ( (1)^2 -2*1 +2 ) * ( (-1)^2 -2*(-1) +2 ) = (1 -2 +2)*(1 +2 +2) = (1)*(5)=5. \n\nNow according to the formula, Q(z)=z^2 -1, and the roots of f(z)=z^2 -2 z +2 are a and b. Then Q(a) Q(b) = (a^2 -1)(b^2 -1). Let's compute a and b: roots of z^2 -2 z +2=0 are 1\u00b1i. Then a=1+i, b=1\u2212i. \n\nCompute Q(a)=a^2 -1: a^2 = (1+i)^2=1+2i +i\u00b2=1+2i-1=2i. So Q(a)=2i -1. Similarly Q(b)= (1 -i)^2 -1 =1 -2i +i\u00b2 -1= (1-1) + (-2i) + (-1) = -2i -1. So Q(a) Q(b)= (-1 +2i)(-1 -2i)= (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-2i) + (2i)(-1) + (2i)(-2i). Wait, but actually:\n\nAlternatively, ( -1 +2i)(-1 -2i ) = (-1)^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - ( -4 ) = 1 +4=5, which matches the direct calculation. So the formula works here. So in the case of n=2, it works, so my reasoning seems okay.\n\nTherefore, trusting the formula, in the case of n=13, the product is indeed Q(a) Q(b)=8321. Therefore, the answer mod 1000 is 321. Wait, but let me check if 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321. Since 8321 divided by 1000 is 8.321, so 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321. However, let me just check once more if there was a miscalculation in exponents. Let me recheck the calculation of a^{13} and b^{13}.\n\nWait, modulus of a is sqrt(2), so modulus of a^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 =2^{6.5}=2^6 * 2^{0.5}=64*sqrt(2). But when I calculated a^{13}, I ended up with modulus sqrt( (-64)^2 + (-64)^2 ) = sqrt( 64^2 *2 ) = 64*sqrt(2). So that matches. Similarly for b^{13}, modulus is same. Therefore, the modulus is okay.\n\nThe angles were correctly calculated. The angles after exponentiation give the correct components. The product calculation also checks out.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 321. Hmm, but let me see if there is another approach that might lead to a different result, or perhaps verify again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product over (2 -2 z + z^2) for all z^{13}=1 can be written as the product over (z^2 -2 z +2). Let me consider that this product is equal to the product over (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)). So the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)). \n\nWhich is the same as [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1+i))] * [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 -i))] \n\nWhich is equal to Q(1 +i) * Q(1 -i), where Q(z) = z^{13} -1, which is exactly the same as before. Therefore, indeed, the product is ( (1 +i)^{13} -1 )*( (1 -i)^{13} -1 ), which is exactly the same as (a^{13}-1)(b^{13}-1). So that's consistent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute (1 +i)^13 directly? Let me try that.\n\nFirst, (1 +i)^1 =1 +i.\n\n(1 +i)^2 = 2i.\n\n(1 +i)^3 = 2i*(1 +i) = 2i + 2i^2 = 2i -2 = -2 + 2i.\n\n(1 +i)^4 = (-2 +2i)(1 +i) = -2(1 +i) +2i(1 +i) = -2 -2i +2i +2i^2 = -2 +0i -2 = -4.\n\n(1 +i)^4 = -4.\n\nThen (1 +i)^8 = ( -4 )^2 = 16.\n\n(1 +i)^12 = (1 +i)^8 * (1 +i)^4 =16*(-4)= -64.\n\nThen (1 +i)^13 = (1 +i)^12*(1 +i)= -64*(1 +i) = -64 -64i, which matches previous result. Similarly for (1 -i)^13:\n\n(1 -i)^1 =1 -i\n\n(1 -i)^2 = -2i\n\n(1 -i)^3 = -2i*(1 -i) = -2i +2i^2= -2i -2 = -2 -2i\n\n(1 -i)^4 = (-2 -2i)(1 -i) = -2(1 -i) -2i(1 -i) = -2 +2i -2i + 2i^2 = -2 +0i -2 = -4.\n\nSo (1 -i)^4 = -4, so (1 -i)^12 = (-4)^3 = -64, then (1 -i)^13 = -64*(1 -i) = -64 +64i. Therefore, same as before. \n\nTherefore, (1 +i)^{13} -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i, same as before. So yes, all steps check out. So the final product is indeed 8321, mod 1000 is 321. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 321.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{321}\n",
      "final_answer_text": "\n\nGiven \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity, we need to find the remainder when \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, we recognize that the product can be written as \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (2 - 2z + z^2)\\) where \\(z\\) are the 13th roots of unity.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the remainder when the product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000, where \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity. Hmm, roots of unity often relate to cyclotomic polynomials, so maybe that's a path here. Let me start by recalling some properties of roots of unity and cyclotomic polynomials.\n\nFirst, since \\(\\omega\\) is a 13th root of unity, it satisfies \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), and the minimal polynomial over the integers is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, which is \\(\\Phi_{13}(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \\dots + x + 1\\). But the problem is about a product over all the roots, so maybe I can express this product in terms of some polynomial evaluated at specific points?\n\nLet me consider the general term in the product: \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\). Let's see if I can rewrite this expression in a more manageable form. Let me denote \\(z = \\omega^k\\). Since \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, each \\(z\\) will also be a 13th root of unity (except when \\(k=13\\), but since k goes up to 12, we cover all except 1, but actually when k=0, z=1). So for each term, substituting \\(z = \\omega^k\\), we have the expression \\(2 - 2z + z^2\\). Therefore, the entire product is \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (2 - 2z + z^2)\\), except when z=1? Wait, actually, when k=0, z=1, so the term is \\(2 - 2(1) + 1^2 = 1\\). So the product over k=0 to 12 is the product over all 13th roots of unity of \\(2 - 2z + z^2\\), except maybe I need to check that.\n\nWait, actually, since \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root, the terms \\(\\omega^k\\) for k from 0 to 12 are exactly all the 13th roots of unity. So the product is indeed over all 13th roots of unity. So the product is \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (2 - 2z + z^2)\\). But how do I compute this?\n\nHmm, perhaps I can relate this product to the value of some polynomial evaluated at certain points. Let me think: if I have a polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity, that would be \\(x^{13} - 1 = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (x - \\omega^k)\\). But here, the product is over \\(2 - 2z + z^2\\), so maybe I can manipulate this expression into a form that relates to such polynomials.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that for each z, \\(2 - 2z + z^2\\) can be rewritten. Let me see:\n\nLet me compute \\(2 - 2z + z^2 = z^2 - 2z + 2\\). Hmm, this quadratic in z. Let me see if this factors or has roots. The discriminant is \\(4 - 8 = -4\\), so roots at \\(z = [2 \\pm \\sqrt{-4}]/2 = 1 \\pm i\\). So complex roots, but maybe not helpful here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that \\(z^2 - 2z + 2 = (z - 1)^2 + 1\\). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe consider evaluating the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Since the product is over all roots of z^{13}=1, maybe we can express this as the resultant or something?\n\nAlternatively, consider that for a polynomial P(z), the product over all roots of Q(z) of P(z) is related to the resultant of Q and P. But I might be getting ahead of myself here.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the product as \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\) evaluated at each root z = \\(\\omega^k\\), so maybe the product is equal to the value of some resultant or another polynomial?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2) can be written as the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Let me denote this product as P. Then, since the roots of z^{13}=1 are all the 13th roots of unity, we can write this product as the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2z + 2). \n\nTo compute such a product, perhaps use the fact that for a polynomial f(z), the product over f(z) evaluated at all roots of g(z)=0 is equal to the resultant of g and f, or something like that. Alternatively, perhaps consider that the product is equal to the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at a certain point.\n\nLet me consider that if we have a polynomial whose roots are the z such that z^{13}=1, then the product over (z^2 - 2z + 2) can be thought of as evaluating another polynomial at specific points. Let me think of the product as:\n\n\\[\n\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z^2 - 2z + 2) \\text{ where } z = \\omega^k\n\\]\n\nWait, but actually each term is a quadratic in z. Maybe I can think of this as the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z^2 - 2z + 2). Let me denote f(z) = z^2 - 2z + 2. Then the product is \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} f(z)\\).\n\nThere's a formula for the product over roots of a polynomial of another function. Specifically, if we have a polynomial Q(z) with roots r_i, then the product over f(r_i) can be expressed as the resultant of Q and some other polynomial related to f. Alternatively, perhaps use logarithms, but that might be complicated.\n\nAlternatively, note that if Q(z) = z^{13} - 1, then the product \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} f(z)\\) is equal to the resultant of Q and f, but I might need to recall how resultants work. Alternatively, perhaps think of the product as the value of a certain polynomial evaluated at some point.\n\nWait, here's an idea: Let me consider that for a polynomial P(z) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12} (z - \\omega^k) = z^{13} - 1. Wait, actually that's exactly the polynomial. But here, instead of (z - \\omega^k), we have (z^2 - 2z + 2) evaluated at each \\omega^k. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z + 2) is equal to the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z + 2). Let me think of this as the product over all roots of z^{13}=1 of f(z), where f(z) = z^2 - 2 z + 2.\n\nSo, the product over all roots of Q(z) = z^{13} - 1 of f(z) can be written as the resultant of Q(z) and f(z), but I need to recall the exact formula for that. Alternatively, perhaps use the concept that if we have two polynomials, then the product over f evaluated at roots of Q is equal to the resultant of Q and f divided by the leading coefficient of Q raised to the degree of f, or something like that. Maybe I need to look up the formula, but since I can't do that right now, perhaps think of an example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe consider that if Q(z) = z^{13} - 1, then the product over all roots z of Q(z)=0 of f(z) is equal to the product over all z^{13}=1 of f(z). Let me think of f(z) as a quadratic, so f(z) = z^2 - 2 z + 2. Let me see:\n\nLet me consider that the product over all roots of Q(z)=0 of f(z) is equal to the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z^2 - 2 z + 2). Let me consider that this product can be written as the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - a)(z - b), where a and b are the roots of f(z) = 0. Since f(z) = z^2 - 2 z + 2, its roots are 1 \u00b1 i. Therefore, the product becomes:\n\nProduct_{z^{13}=1} (z - a)(z - b) = [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - a)] * [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - b)].\n\nSo, each of those products is the value of the polynomial Q(z) = z^{13} - 1 evaluated at z = a and z = b respectively. Because the product over (z - root) for all roots of Q is Q(z). Wait, actually, if I have a polynomial Q(z) with roots r_0, r_1,...,r_{n-1}, then the product over (z - r_k) is Q(z). But here, we are evaluating the product over (r_k - a) for each root r_k of Q. So that would be Q(a). Similarly, the product over (r_k - a) = Product_{k} (r_k - a) = Product_{k} (a - r_k) * (-1)^{n} where n is the degree. Wait, actually, the product_{k} (a - r_k) = Q(a). Since Q(z) = Product_{k} (z - r_k), so Q(a) = Product_{k} (a - r_k). Therefore, the product over (r_k - a) is (-1)^{13} Q(a). Since the degree is 13, which is odd, so that's -Q(a). Therefore, the total product is:\n\nProduct_{z^{13}=1} (z - a)(z - b) = [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - a)] * [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - b)] = [ -Q(a) ] * [ -Q(b) ] = Q(a) Q(b).\n\nBecause the product over (z - a) for all roots z of Q is Product_{z} (z - a) = (-1)^{13} Product_{z} (a - z) = - Q(a). Similarly for (z - b). Therefore, the total product is (-Q(a))(-Q(b)) = Q(a) Q(b).\n\nTherefore, the product we need is Q(a) Q(b), where Q(z) = z^{13} - 1, and a and b are the roots of f(z) = z^2 - 2 z + 2.\n\nSo, substituting, we have:\n\nProduct_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = Product_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2 z + 2) = Q(a) Q(b) = (a^{13} - 1)(b^{13} - 1).\n\nSince Q(a) = a^{13} -1 and Q(b) = b^{13} -1.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to computing (a^{13} -1)(b^{13} -1), where a and b are the roots of z^2 - 2 z + 2 = 0. Let me compute a and b first.\n\nThe roots of z^2 - 2 z + 2 = 0 are:\n\nz = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 8)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(-4)] / 2 = 1 \u00b1 i.\n\nTherefore, a = 1 + i and b = 1 - i. Therefore, we need to compute (a^{13} -1)(b^{13} -1).\n\nFirst, compute a^{13} and b^{13}. Since a and b are complex conjugates, their powers will also be conjugates, so (a^{13} -1) and (b^{13} -1) are conjugates. Therefore, their product is |a^{13} -1|^2, but maybe it's easier to compute directly.\n\nAlternatively, note that a = 1 + i. Let me compute a^{13}. Let me write a in polar form. The modulus of a is sqrt(1^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(2). The argument is arctan(1/1) = \u03c0/4. So a = sqrt(2) e^{i \u03c0/4}. Therefore, a^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{i (13 * \u03c0/4)}.\n\nSimilarly, b = 1 - i has modulus sqrt(2), argument -\u03c0/4, so b^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} e^{-i (13 * \u03c0/4)}.\n\nFirst, compute (sqrt(2))^{13} = (2^{1/2})^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2).\n\nThen, the angle for a^{13} is 13 * \u03c0/4. Let me compute that modulo 2\u03c0. Since 13 * \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0/4 + 3\u03c0. 3\u03c0 is equivalent to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0). Wait, actually, 13 divided by 8 (since 2\u03c0 is a full circle, and \u03c0/4 increments per step). Wait, let me compute 13*(\u03c0/4):\n\n13*(\u03c0/4) = (12 +1)*(\u03c0/4) = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 3\u03c0 is equivalent to 3\u03c0 - 2\u03c0 = \u03c0. So 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Wait, actually:\n\nWait, 13*(\u03c0/4) = (12*(\u03c0/4)) + \u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4. Since 3\u03c0 is equal to \u03c0 modulo 2\u03c0 (since 3\u03c0 = \u03c0 + 2\u03c0), so 3\u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = \u03c0 + \u03c0/4 = 5\u03c0/4. Therefore, the angle for a^{13} is 5\u03c0/4. Similarly, the angle for b^{13} is -13\u03c0/4. Let me compute that similarly:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = - (12\u03c0/4 + \u03c0/4) = -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4. Adding 2\u03c0 to get it within 0 to 2\u03c0: -3\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = -\u03c0 - \u03c0/4 = -5\u03c0/4, which is equivalent to 2\u03c0 -5\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. Wait, maybe better to compute modulo 2\u03c0:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 = -13\u03c0/4 + 4\u03c0 = ( -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 ) = 3\u03c0/4. Wait, that's not right. Wait, adding 2\u03c0 (which is 8\u03c0/4) to -13\u03c0/4 gives (-13\u03c0/4 + 8\u03c0/4) = (-5\u03c0/4). Hmm, maybe I should do it step by step.\n\nAlternatively, -13\u03c0/4 divided by 2\u03c0 is -13/8, so the integer part is -2 (since -2*2\u03c0 = -4\u03c0, which is -8\u03c0/4, so -13\u03c0/4 - (-8\u03c0/4) = -5\u03c0/4. So angle is -5\u03c0/4, which is equivalent to -5\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0 = 3\u03c0/4. Wait, so angle for b^{13} is 3\u03c0/4?\n\nWait, let me check again. The angle for b is -\u03c0/4. So multiplying by 13 gives angle -13\u03c0/4. To find an equivalent angle between 0 and 2\u03c0:\n\n-13\u03c0/4 + 2\u03c0*2 = -13\u03c0/4 + 16\u03c0/4 = 3\u03c0/4. Yes, so angle is 3\u03c0/4. Therefore, a^{13} has angle 5\u03c0/4, and b^{13} has angle 3\u03c0/4.\n\nTherefore, a^{13} is modulus (sqrt(2))^{13} times e^{i5\u03c0/4}, and b^{13} is modulus (sqrt(2))^{13} times e^{i3\u03c0/4}.\n\nTherefore, a^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13} * (cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4)) = (sqrt(2))^{13} * (-sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nSimilarly, b^{13} = (sqrt(2))^{13}*(cos(3\u03c0/4) + i sin(3\u03c0/4)) = (sqrt(2))^{13}*(-sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2).\n\nWait, let me compute these terms:\n\nFirst, (sqrt(2))^{13} = 2^{13/2} = 2^6 * 2^{1/2} = 64 * sqrt(2). So:\n\na^{13} = 64 * sqrt(2) * [ cos(5\u03c0/4) + i sin(5\u03c0/4) ]\n\ncos(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2. So:\n\na^{13} = 64*sqrt(2) * ( -sqrt(2)/2 - i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i) ]\n\nMultiply sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) gives 2, so:\n\n= 64 * ( -2/2 (1 + i) ) = 64 * (-1 - i) = -64(1 + i)\n\nSimilarly, for b^{13}:\n\ncos(3\u03c0/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3\u03c0/4) = sqrt(2)/2.\n\nThus:\n\nb^{13} = 64*sqrt(2) * ( -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ) = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 (1 - i) ]\n\nAgain, sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2:\n\n= 64*( -2/2 (1 - i) ) = 64*(-1 + i) = -64(1 - i)\n\nTherefore, a^{13} -1 = -64(1 + i) -1 = -65 -64i\n\nSimilarly, b^{13} -1 = -64(1 - i) -1 = -65 +64i\n\nTherefore, the product (a^{13} -1)(b^{13} -1) = (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i)\n\nMultiply these two complex numbers:\n\nFirst, note that (x - y)(x + y) = x^2 - y^2, but here it's ( -65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = [(-65)^2 - (64i)^2] ?\n\nWait, actually, let me compute step by step:\n\n(-65 -64i)(-65 +64i) = (-65)(-65) + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i)\n\n= 65^2 + (-65*64i) + (64*65i) + (-64^2 i^2)\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: 65^2 = 4225\n\nSecond term: -65*64i\n\nThird term: +64*65i\n\nFourth term: - (64)^2 (i^2) = -4096*(-1) = +4096\n\nNotice that the second and third terms cancel each other because -65*64i +64*65i = 0. So those cross terms vanish.\n\nTherefore, total is 4225 + 4096 = 8321\n\nWait, 4225 + 4096: 4000 + 4000 = 8000, 225 + 96 = 321, so total 8321.\n\nTherefore, the product (a^{13} -1)(b^{13} -1) = 8321.\n\nTherefore, the original product \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is equal to 8321. Then the problem asks for the remainder when this is divided by 1000. So compute 8321 mod 1000.\n\nDividing 8321 by 1000: 1000*8 = 8000, 8321 - 8000 = 321. Therefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait a second, hold on. Let me confirm the steps again because sometimes complex calculations can lead to errors.\n\nFirst, let me verify the calculation of a^{13} and b^{13}:\n\nWe had a =1 + i, which is sqrt(2) e^{i pi/4}, so a^13 would be (sqrt(2))^13 e^{i (13 * pi/4)}.\n\n(sqrt(2))^13 is 2^(13/2) = 2^6 * 2^(1/2) = 64 * sqrt(2). Correct.\n\nAngle 13 * pi/4: 13 divided by 4 is 3 with remainder 1, so 3* pi + pi/4, which is 3pi + pi/4. Since angles are modulo 2pi, subtract 2pi: 3pi + pi/4 - 2pi = pi + pi/4 = 5pi/4. Correct. So angle is 5pi/4. So a^{13} is 64 sqrt(2) * (cos5pi/4 + i sin5pi/4) which is 64 sqrt(2) * (-sqrt(2)/2 -i sqrt(2)/2). Multiplying sqrt(2)*sqrt(2) gives 2, so 64 * (- (sqrt(2)/2 * sqrt(2)) ) = 64 * (- (2/2) ) = 64*(-1). Wait, hold on:\n\nWait, let me re-calculate the components step by step.\n\nCompute cos(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2, sin(5\u03c0/4) = -\u221a2/2.\n\nThus:\n\na^{13} = 64\u221a2 * [ (-\u221a2/2) + i*(-\u221a2/2) ]\n\nMultiply term by term:\n\nFirst component: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2) = 64 * (- (\u221a2 * \u221a2)/2 ) = 64 * (-2/2) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the second component: 64\u221a2 * (-\u221a2/2)i = same as above, so -64i.\n\nTherefore, total a^{13} = -64 -64i. Wait, hold on, that contradicts my previous calculation. Wait, in my previous step, I thought the terms were -64*(1 + i), but now I see:\n\nWait, cos(5pi/4) is -sqrt(2)/2, so the real part is:\n\n64\u221a2 * (-sqrt(2)/2) = 64 * (sqrt(2)*sqrt(2))/2 * (-1) = 64*(2)/2*(-1) = 64*(-1) = -64.\n\nSimilarly, the imaginary part is the same: 64\u221a2*(-sqrt(2)/2)i = -64i. So indeed, a^{13} = -64 -64i.\n\nWait, so my previous calculation had a mistake. I think I miscalculated earlier. Wait, so in my first calculation I thought:\n\na^{13} = 64*sqrt(2) * [ -sqrt(2)/2 (1 + i) ]\n\nBut sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)/2 is (2)/2 =1, so 64 * (-1)(1 +i) = -64(1 +i). Which is the same as -64 -64i. So that was correct. So then, a^{13} -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i. Correct.\n\nSimilarly, b^{13}:\n\nb =1 -i, so angle -pi/4. So angle after multiplying by 13 is -13 pi/4. Adding 4 pi (since 2 pi is a full circle), so -13 pi/4 + 4 pi = (-13 pi/4 + 16 pi/4)= 3 pi/4. So angle 3 pi/4. So cos(3 pi/4) = -sqrt(2)/2, sin(3 pi/4)= sqrt(2)/2.\n\nTherefore, b^{13} =64\u221a2 [ -sqrt(2)/2 + i sqrt(2)/2 ]\n\nCalculates to:\n\nReal part: 64\u221a2*(-sqrt(2)/2)= -64, imaginary part: 64\u221a2*(sqrt(2)/2)i = +64i. So total b^{13} = -64 +64i. Therefore, b^{13} -1 = (-64 +64i) -1 = -65 +64i.\n\nTherefore, the product (a^{13} -1)(b^{13}-1) is (-65 -64i)(-65 +64i). Let me compute this again:\n\nFirst, expand the product:\n\n(-65)(-65) + (-65)(64i) + (-64i)(-65) + (-64i)(64i)\n\nFirst term: 65^2 = 4225\n\nSecond term: -65*64i = -4160i\n\nThird term: +64*65i = +4160i\n\nFourth term: -64*64 i^2 = -4096*(-1) = +4096\n\nTherefore, adding all terms:\n\n4225 + ( -4160i +4160i ) + 4096 = 4225 + 0 + 4096 = 8321. So that's correct.\n\nSo the product is indeed 8321. Then 8321 divided by 1000: 8*1000 =8000, 8321 -8000 =321. Therefore, the remainder is 321.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check if I made a mistake in the very first step where I converted the original product into Q(a) Q(b). Let me verify that step again.\n\nThe original product is \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12} (2 - 2 \\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\). Let me note that in my reasoning, I set z = \\omega^k, so the term becomes z^2 -2 z +2. Therefore, the product over all 13th roots of unity of (z^2 -2 z +2). Since \\(\\omega^k\\) for k from 0 to 12 are all roots of z^{13}=1, so yes, the product is over all roots z^{13}=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2). Then, using the formula that this product is equal to Q(a) Q(b), where Q(z)=z^{13}-1 and a,b are roots of z^2 -2 z +2 =0. \n\nWait, but let me verify with a simpler case. Let me take a smaller n, like n=1. Wait, but n=1 would be trivial. Let me try n=2. Suppose instead of 13th roots, take 2nd roots. Let me see if the formula holds. Suppose n=2, so the product over z^2=1 of (z^2 -2 z +2). The roots are z=1 and z=-1. The product would be ( (1)^2 -2*1 +2 ) * ( (-1)^2 -2*(-1) +2 ) = (1 -2 +2)*(1 +2 +2) = (1)*(5)=5. \n\nNow according to the formula, Q(z)=z^2 -1, and the roots of f(z)=z^2 -2 z +2 are a and b. Then Q(a) Q(b) = (a^2 -1)(b^2 -1). Let's compute a and b: roots of z^2 -2 z +2=0 are 1\u00b1i. Then a=1+i, b=1\u2212i. \n\nCompute Q(a)=a^2 -1: a^2 = (1+i)^2=1+2i +i\u00b2=1+2i-1=2i. So Q(a)=2i -1. Similarly Q(b)= (1 -i)^2 -1 =1 -2i +i\u00b2 -1= (1-1) + (-2i) + (-1) = -2i -1. So Q(a) Q(b)= (-1 +2i)(-1 -2i)= (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-2i) + (2i)(-1) + (2i)(-2i). Wait, but actually:\n\nAlternatively, ( -1 +2i)(-1 -2i ) = (-1)^2 - (2i)^2 = 1 - ( -4 ) = 1 +4=5, which matches the direct calculation. So the formula works here. So in the case of n=2, it works, so my reasoning seems okay.\n\nTherefore, trusting the formula, in the case of n=13, the product is indeed Q(a) Q(b)=8321. Therefore, the answer mod 1000 is 321. Wait, but let me check if 8321 mod 1000 is indeed 321. Since 8321 divided by 1000 is 8.321, so 8*1000=8000, 8321-8000=321. Correct. \n\nTherefore, the remainder is 321. However, let me just check once more if there was a miscalculation in exponents. Let me recheck the calculation of a^{13} and b^{13}.\n\nWait, modulus of a is sqrt(2), so modulus of a^13 is (sqrt(2))^13 =2^{6.5}=2^6 * 2^{0.5}=64*sqrt(2). But when I calculated a^{13}, I ended up with modulus sqrt( (-64)^2 + (-64)^2 ) = sqrt( 64^2 *2 ) = 64*sqrt(2). So that matches. Similarly for b^{13}, modulus is same. Therefore, the modulus is okay.\n\nThe angles were correctly calculated. The angles after exponentiation give the correct components. The product calculation also checks out.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 321. Hmm, but let me see if there is another approach that might lead to a different result, or perhaps verify again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider that the product over (2 -2 z + z^2) for all z^{13}=1 can be written as the product over (z^2 -2 z +2). Let me consider that this product is equal to the product over (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)). So the product over all z^{13}=1 of (z - (1 +i))(z - (1 -i)). \n\nWhich is the same as [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1+i))] * [Product_{z^{13}=1} (z - (1 -i))] \n\nWhich is equal to Q(1 +i) * Q(1 -i), where Q(z) = z^{13} -1, which is exactly the same as before. Therefore, indeed, the product is ( (1 +i)^{13} -1 )*( (1 -i)^{13} -1 ), which is exactly the same as (a^{13}-1)(b^{13}-1). So that's consistent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute (1 +i)^13 directly? Let me try that.\n\nFirst, (1 +i)^1 =1 +i.\n\n(1 +i)^2 = 2i.\n\n(1 +i)^3 = 2i*(1 +i) = 2i + 2i^2 = 2i -2 = -2 + 2i.\n\n(1 +i)^4 = (-2 +2i)(1 +i) = -2(1 +i) +2i(1 +i) = -2 -2i +2i +2i^2 = -2 +0i -2 = -4.\n\n(1 +i)^4 = -4.\n\nThen (1 +i)^8 = ( -4 )^2 = 16.\n\n(1 +i)^12 = (1 +i)^8 * (1 +i)^4 =16*(-4)= -64.\n\nThen (1 +i)^13 = (1 +i)^12*(1 +i)= -64*(1 +i) = -64 -64i, which matches previous result. Similarly for (1 -i)^13:\n\n(1 -i)^1 =1 -i\n\n(1 -i)^2 = -2i\n\n(1 -i)^3 = -2i*(1 -i) = -2i +2i^2= -2i -2 = -2 -2i\n\n(1 -i)^4 = (-2 -2i)(1 -i) = -2(1 -i) -2i(1 -i) = -2 +2i -2i + 2i^2 = -2 +0i -2 = -4.\n\nSo (1 -i)^4 = -4, so (1 -i)^12 = (-4)^3 = -64, then (1 -i)^13 = -64*(1 -i) = -64 +64i. Therefore, same as before. \n\nTherefore, (1 +i)^{13} -1 = (-64 -64i) -1 = -65 -64i, same as before. So yes, all steps check out. So the final product is indeed 8321, mod 1000 is 321. \n\nTherefore, I think the answer is 321.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{321}\n\n\nGiven \\(\\omega \\neq 1\\) is a 13th root of unity, we need to find the remainder when \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000.\n\nFirst, we recognize that the product can be written as \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (2 - 2z + z^2)\\) where \\(z\\) are the 13th roots of unity. This product is equivalent to \\(\\prod_{z^{13}=1} (z^2 - 2z + 2)\\).\n\nThe quadratic \\(z^2 - 2z + 2\\) has roots \\(a = 1 + i\\) and \\(b = 1 - i\\).
