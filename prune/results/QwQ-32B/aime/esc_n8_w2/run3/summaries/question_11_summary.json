      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let's start by recalling that for a complex number z with |z| = 4, we can write z in polar form as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That might make it easier to handle the division by z, since 1/z would then be (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. \n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression using z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. Then, substituting into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8})\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8}\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i)/e^{i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)*e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, maybe I can write this as A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}, where A = 4*(75 + 117i) and B = (24 + 36i). Then, the real part of this expression will be the real part of A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}. Since we need to maximize the real part, perhaps I can express this in terms of cosine and sine?\n\nAlternatively, since the real part of a complex number is linear, maybe we can compute the real part of each term separately and then add them. Let's try that.\n\nLet me denote z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i)*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) + 4i*(75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8) [Wait, actually, expanding (a + ib)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8):\n\nReal part: (a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8), Imaginary part: (a sin\u03b8 + b cos\u03b8). So multiplying by 4 gives real part 4*(a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8), etc.]\n\nSimilarly, the second term (24 + 36i)*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8):\n\nReal part: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8, Imaginary part: -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8. But since it's multiplied by (cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8), the real part comes from (24)(cos\u03b8) + (36)(sin\u03b8), because (a + ib)(c - id) = (ac + bd) + i(bc - ad). Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, (24 + 36i)*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8. Since i\u00b2 = -1, so the last term is +36 sin\u03b8. Therefore, combining real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary: (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)\n\nTherefore, the total expression's real part is:\n\n[First term real part] + [Second term real part] \n\nFirst term real part: 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8)\n\nSecond term real part: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nTherefore, total real part:\n\n4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) + 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, expand 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8):\n\n= 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nThen add 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8\n\n-468 sin\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 = -432 sin\u03b8\n\nSo the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nHmm, okay, so this is a standard trigonometric expression of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, but here it's A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 with A = 324, B = -432. The maximum value of such an expression is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, let me recall the formula: the maximum of C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 is sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2). \n\nWait, so here, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which can be written as C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 where C = 324 and D = -432. Therefore, the maximum value is sqrt( (324)^2 + (-432)^2 ). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared: 324^2. Let's see, 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400. So (300 +24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104, 976? Wait, 90000 +14,400 = 104,400 + 576 = 104,976. So 324^2 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared. Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1024, cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 +32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624. Since it's (-432)^2, it's also 186,624.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 104,976 + 186,624 = let's add them:\n\n104,976 + 186,624:\n\n100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000\n\n4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600\n\nTotal is 280,000 + 11,600 = 291,600. \n\nTherefore sqrt(291,600). Let's see, sqrt(291,600). Since 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 50^2=2500, so 540^2 = (500 +40)^2 = 500\u00b2 + 2*500*40 +40\u00b2 = 250,000 +40,000 +1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600)=540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540? Wait, hold on, but the formula is that the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, but in this case, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. So the coefficients are A = 324 and B = -432, so the maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) which is indeed sqrt(291,600) = 540. Therefore the maximum real part is 540?\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the coefficients. Let me check again the real part calculation step by step.\n\nOriginal expression: (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z|=4. Let me write z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. \n\nFirst term: (75+117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = (75*4 + 117i*4)e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 +144i)/ (4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is (300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nNow, to compute the real part, let's expand each term:\n\nFirst term: (300 +468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\n\n= 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 + i(300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)\n\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 -24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 -36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\n\n= 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 + i( -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8 )\n\nAdding the real parts of both terms:\n\nFirst term real: 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nSecond term real: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nTotal real part: (300 +24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the real part is indeed 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, the maximum of this expression is sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) = 540, so the maximum real part is 540. Wait, but hold on. The formula is that the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). So in this case, A is 324 and B is -432. Therefore, the expression is A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, so the maximum is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Since B is negative, but squaring removes the sign, so yes, sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) = 540. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 540? Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me check the coefficients again step by step. \n\nOriginal problem:\n\nFirst term: (75+117i)z where z=4e^{i\u03b8} gives 4*(75+117i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96+144i)/z = (96+144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i)/e^{i\u03b8} = (24+36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nThen, expanding first term:\n\n(75*4 + 117i*4) e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). \n\nSo when expanded, the real part is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. \n\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). \n\nExpanding gives 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 (since the cross terms: -24i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8, but the real part comes from 24 cos\u03b8 and 36i * i sin\u03b8? Wait, let me check again. \n\nWait, (24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 -24i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8 -36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8. \n\nThe real parts are 24 cos\u03b8 (from first term) and -36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8. Since i\u00b2 is -1, so -36*(-1) sin\u03b8 = 36 sin\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, real part is 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8. \n\nImaginary parts are -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8, but we don't care about that. \n\nTherefore, adding the real parts of the two terms:\n\nFirst term real part: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8\n\nSecond term real part: 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8\n\nTotal: 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nThe maximum of this expression is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ). \n\nLet me confirm the arithmetic again. \n\n324 squared: 324 * 324. Let's compute 300\u00b2 = 90,000. 24\u00b2=576. Then cross term 2*300*24 = 14,400. So total (300+24)^2 = 90,000 +14,400 +576 = 104,976. \n\n432 squared: 400\u00b2 + 32\u00b2 + 2*400*32 = 160,000 + 1,024 + 25,600 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600 plus 1,024 gives 186,624. \n\nAdding 104,976 + 186,624:\n\n104,976 + 186,624:\n\nLet me add 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000\n\nThen 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600\n\nTotal is 280,000 +11,600 = 291,600. \n\nsqrt(291,600). Let me check sqrt(291600). Well, sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916)*sqrt(100) = 54*10 = 540. Because 54^2 is 2916 (since 50\u00b2=2500, 5\u00b2=25, so 54\u00b2 = 2916). So yes, sqrt(291600) is indeed 540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think if there's another consideration here. The expression (75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z. Since z is a complex number with |z|=4, but when we write z =4e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/z is (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})). Wait, in my substitution above, I used z=4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. But in the problem, the term is (96+144i)/z, so that is indeed (96+144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24+36i)e^{-i\u03b8}, which is what I had. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another approach. Let me see. \n\nSuppose we let w = z / |z|. Since |z| =4, then |w| =1. Let me set w = e^{i\u03b8}, so z =4w. Then, 1/z = 1/(4w). \n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n(75+117i)*(4w) + (96+144i)/(4w)\n\n= 4*(75+117i) w + (24+36i)/w\n\nLet me denote A = 4*(75+117i), B =24+36i. So the expression is A w + B / w, where |w|=1. \n\nThen, since |w|=1, 1/w = conjugate(w) if w is on the unit circle, but actually more precisely, 1/w = conjugate(w) only if |w|=1. Wait, yes, because if w = e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/w = e^{-i\u03b8} = conjugate(w). \n\nTherefore, the expression is A w + B conjugate(w). Since conjugate(w) = 1/w. \n\nTherefore, the real part of A w + B conjugate(w). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write this in terms of vectors or use calculus to maximize. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the expression as a function of \u03b8, which we have already done, and found that the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which has maximum sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a linear combination of cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, so writing it as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude. The maximum is R. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error here. Let me see. Suppose the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Let me compute its maximum. \n\nYes, the maximum value is indeed the square root of (324)^2 + (-432)^2, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the sign. Let me see, since the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, so when written as A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, B here is -432. \n\nTherefore, the amplitude is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + ( -432)^2) = same as before. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but let me see if there's another way to check this. Suppose we set derivative to zero? \n\nLet me consider f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. To find maximum, take derivative:\n\nf\u2019(\u03b8) = -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8. Setting to zero:\n\n-324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 =0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 +432 cos\u03b8 =0 \u2192 \n\ntan\u03b8 = -432/324 = -4/3. \n\nWait, let me compute 432 divided by 324. \n\n432/324 = 4/3 (since 432 \u00f7 108 =4, 324 \u00f7108=3). So tan\u03b8 = -4/3. \n\nTherefore, the critical points are at \u03b8 where tan\u03b8 = -4/3. \n\nSo, let me compute the value of f(\u03b8) at this angle. Let me suppose \u03b8 is in the fourth quadrant where tan\u03b8 = -4/3. \n\nLet me compute sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8. Let\u2019s suppose that tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Let me take \u03b8 such that cos\u03b8 = 3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5 (since tan\u03b8 = sin/cos = -4/3, so in fourth quadrant). Alternatively, if in second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5 and sin\u03b8 =4/5. \n\nWait, but to get tan\u03b8 = -4/3, the angle could be in second or fourth quadrant. Let me check both possibilities. \n\nFirst, let's take the fourth quadrant angle where cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5. Then f(\u03b8) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540. \n\nAlternatively, in second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 =4/5. Then f(\u03b8) = 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum is indeed 540, achieved when cos\u03b8 = 3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5, i.e., \u03b8 in fourth quadrant. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but just to confirm, let me plug in \u03b8 where cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5 into the original expression. Let me see if that gives the real part 540. \n\nLet me compute the real part expression:\n\n324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = 2700/5 = 540. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the original expression. Let me choose z such that z =4e^{i\u03b8} where \u03b8 is such that cos\u03b8=3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5. \n\nSo z =4*(3/5 -4i/5) = (12/5 -16i/5). \n\nLet me compute (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. \n\nFirst compute (75+117i)z:\n\nz = (12/5 -16i/5). \n\nMultiply by (75 +117i):\n\nFirst, 75*(12/5) = 75*(12)/5 = 15*12 = 180\n\n75*(-16i/5) = -240i\n\n117i*(12/5) = (1404/5)i\n\n117i*(-16i/5) = - (1872/5)i\u00b2 = +1872/5 since i\u00b2 =-1.\n\nAdding these terms:\n\nReal parts: 180 + 1872/5 = (900 +1872)/5 = 2772/5\n\nImaginary parts: -240i + (1404/5)i = (-1200/5 +1404/5)i = (204/5)i\n\nSo first term: (2772/5) + (204/5)i\n\nSecond term: (96 +144i)/z. Since z = (12/5 -16i/5), so 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|\u00b2. Since |z|=4, |z|\u00b2=16. \n\nConjugate(z) is 12/5 +16i/5. Therefore, 1/z = (12/5 +16i/5)/16 = (12 +16i)/80 = (3 +4i)/20.\n\nTherefore, (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(3 +4i)/20.\n\nLet me compute (96 +144i)(3 +4i):\n\nFirst, 96*3 =288\n\n96*4i = 384i\n\n144i*3 = 432i\n\n144i*4i = 576i\u00b2 = -576\n\nAdding all terms:\n\nReal parts: 288 -576 = -288\n\nImaginary parts: 384i +432i = 816i\n\nTherefore, the second term is (-288 +816i)/20 = (-288/20) + (816/20)i = -14.4 +40.8i\n\nAdding the first term and the second term:\n\nFirst term: (2772/5) \u2248 554.4 + (204/5)i \u224840.8i\n\nSecond term: -14.4 +40.8i\n\nAdding real parts: 554.4 -14.4 = 540\n\nImaginary parts: 40.8i +40.8i =81.6i. \n\nSo the total expression is 540 +81.6i. Therefore, the real part is indeed 540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nTherefore, I think that is correct. \n\nWait, but just to check another angle. Suppose \u03b8 is such that tan\u03b8 = -4/3 but in another quadrant. Wait, but we saw that when in the fourth quadrant, we get the maximum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another angle gives a higher value? Let me see. Suppose \u03b8=0, then cos\u03b8=1, sin\u03b8=0. Then real part is 324*1 -432*0 =324. Which is less than 540. \n\nIf \u03b8= \u03c0/2, then cos\u03b8=0, sin\u03b8=1. Real part is 0 -432*1 = -432. \n\nIf \u03b8= \u03c0, cos\u03b8 = -1, sin\u03b8=0, real part is -324. \n\n\u03b8= 3\u03c0/2, cos\u03b8=0, sin\u03b8=-1. Real part is 0 -432*(-1)=432. \n\nSo indeed the maximum seems to be 540. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 540.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, let's start by recalling that for a complex number z with |z| = 4, we can write z in polar form as z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, where \u03b8 is the argument of z. That might make it easier to handle the division by z, since 1/z would then be (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. \n\nFirst, let me rewrite the expression using z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. Then, substituting into the expression:\n\n(75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} + (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8})\n\nSimplify each term:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i) * 4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8}\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i)/e^{i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)*e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo the entire expression becomes:\n\n4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)*e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, maybe I can write this as A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}, where A = 4*(75 + 117i) and B = (24 + 36i). Then, the real part of this expression will be the real part of A e^{i\u03b8} + B e^{-i\u03b8}. Since we need to maximize the real part, perhaps I can express this in terms of cosine and sine?\n\nAlternatively, since the real part of a complex number is linear, maybe we can compute the real part of each term separately and then add them. Let's try that.\n\nLet me denote z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Let me compute each term:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i)*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) + 4i*(75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8) [Wait, actually, expanding (a + ib)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8):\n\nReal part: (a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8), Imaginary part: (a sin\u03b8 + b cos\u03b8). So multiplying by 4 gives real part 4*(a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8), etc.]\n\nSimilarly, the second term (24 + 36i)*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8):\n\nReal part: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8, Imaginary part: -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8. But since it's multiplied by (cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8), the real part comes from (24)(cos\u03b8) + (36)(sin\u03b8), because (a + ib)(c - id) = (ac + bd) + i(bc - ad). Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, (24 + 36i)*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8. Since i\u00b2 = -1, so the last term is +36 sin\u03b8. Therefore, combining real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary: (-24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8)\n\nTherefore, the total expression's real part is:\n\n[First term real part] + [Second term real part] \n\nFirst term real part: 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8)\n\nSecond term real part: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nTherefore, total real part:\n\n4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) + 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, expand 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8):\n\n= 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nThen add 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8\n\n-468 sin\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 = -432 sin\u03b8\n\nSo the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nHmm, okay, so this is a standard trigonometric expression of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, but here it's A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 with A = 324, B = -432. The maximum value of such an expression is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, let me recall the formula: the maximum of C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 is sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2). \n\nWait, so here, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8, which can be written as C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 where C = 324 and D = -432. Therefore, the maximum value is sqrt( (324)^2 + (-432)^2 ). Let me compute that:\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared: 324^2. Let's see, 300^2 = 90000, 24^2=576, and cross term 2*300*24=14400. So (300 +24)^2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104, 976? Wait, 90000 +14,400 = 104,400 + 576 = 104,976. So 324^2 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared. Let's compute 400^2 = 160,000, 32^2 = 1024, cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 +32)^2 = 160,000 + 25,600 + 1,024 = 186,624. Since it's (-432)^2, it's also 186,624.\n\nTherefore, the sum is 104,976 + 186,624 = let's add them:\n\n104,976 + 186,624:\n\n100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000\n\n4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600\n\nTotal is 280,000 + 11,600 = 291,600. \n\nTherefore sqrt(291,600). Let's see, sqrt(291,600). Since 540^2 = 291,600 because 500^2=250,000, 50^2=2500, so 540^2 = (500 +40)^2 = 500\u00b2 + 2*500*40 +40\u00b2 = 250,000 +40,000 +1,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600)=540.\n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540? Wait, hold on, but the formula is that the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, but in this case, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. So the coefficients are A = 324 and B = -432, so the maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) which is indeed sqrt(291,600) = 540. Therefore the maximum real part is 540?\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistake in the coefficients. Let me check again the real part calculation step by step.\n\nOriginal expression: (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z where |z|=4. Let me write z = 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. \n\nFirst term: (75+117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = (75*4 + 117i*4)e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 +144i)/ (4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nTherefore, the entire expression is (300 +468i)e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nNow, to compute the real part, let's expand each term:\n\nFirst term: (300 +468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 + 300i sin\u03b8 + 468i cos\u03b8 + 468i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\n\n= 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 + i(300 sin\u03b8 + 468 cos\u03b8)\n\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 -24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 -36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\n\n= 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 + i( -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8 )\n\nAdding the real parts of both terms:\n\nFirst term real: 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nSecond term real: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nTotal real part: (300 +24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nYes, that's correct. So the real part is indeed 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, the maximum of this expression is sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) = 540, so the maximum real part is 540. Wait, but hold on. The formula is that the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). So in this case, A is 324 and B is -432. Therefore, the expression is A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, so the maximum is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Since B is negative, but squaring removes the sign, so yes, sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2) = 540. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 540? Hmm, but let me think again. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me check the coefficients again step by step. \n\nOriginal problem:\n\nFirst term: (75+117i)z where z=4e^{i\u03b8} gives 4*(75+117i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96+144i)/z = (96+144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24 + 36i)/e^{i\u03b8} = (24+36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nThen, expanding first term:\n\n(75*4 + 117i*4) e^{i\u03b8} = (300 + 468i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8). \n\nSo when expanded, the real part is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. \n\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). \n\nExpanding gives 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 (since the cross terms: -24i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8, but the real part comes from 24 cos\u03b8 and 36i * i sin\u03b8? Wait, let me check again. \n\nWait, (24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8) = 24 cos\u03b8 -24i sin\u03b8 +36i cos\u03b8 -36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8. \n\nThe real parts are 24 cos\u03b8 (from first term) and -36i\u00b2 sin\u03b8. Since i\u00b2 is -1, so -36*(-1) sin\u03b8 = 36 sin\u03b8. \n\nTherefore, real part is 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8. \n\nImaginary parts are -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8, but we don't care about that. \n\nTherefore, adding the real parts of the two terms:\n\nFirst term real part: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8\n\nSecond term real part: 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8\n\nTotal: 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nTherefore, the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. \n\nThe maximum of this expression is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ). \n\nLet me confirm the arithmetic again. \n\n324 squared: 324 * 324. Let's compute 300\u00b2 = 90,000. 24\u00b2=576. Then cross term 2*300*24 = 14,400. So total (300+24)^2 = 90,000 +14,400 +576 = 104,976. \n\n432 squared: 400\u00b2 + 32\u00b2 + 2*400*32 = 160,000 + 1,024 + 25,600 = 160,000 +25,600 is 185,600 plus 1,024 gives 186,624. \n\nAdding 104,976 + 186,624:\n\n104,976 + 186,624:\n\nLet me add 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000\n\nThen 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600\n\nTotal is 280,000 +11,600 = 291,600. \n\nsqrt(291,600). Let me check sqrt(291600). Well, sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916)*sqrt(100) = 54*10 = 540. Because 54^2 is 2916 (since 50\u00b2=2500, 5\u00b2=25, so 54\u00b2 = 2916). So yes, sqrt(291600) is indeed 540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me think if there's another consideration here. The expression (75 + 117i) z + (96 + 144i)/z. Since z is a complex number with |z|=4, but when we write z =4e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/z is (1/(4e^{i\u03b8})). Wait, in my substitution above, I used z=4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. But in the problem, the term is (96+144i)/z, so that is indeed (96+144i)/(4e^{i\u03b8}) = (24+36i)e^{-i\u03b8}, which is what I had. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems correct. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's another approach. Let me see. \n\nSuppose we let w = z / |z|. Since |z| =4, then |w| =1. Let me set w = e^{i\u03b8}, so z =4w. Then, 1/z = 1/(4w). \n\nTherefore, the expression becomes:\n\n(75+117i)*(4w) + (96+144i)/(4w)\n\n= 4*(75+117i) w + (24+36i)/w\n\nLet me denote A = 4*(75+117i), B =24+36i. So the expression is A w + B / w, where |w|=1. \n\nThen, since |w|=1, 1/w = conjugate(w) if w is on the unit circle, but actually more precisely, 1/w = conjugate(w) only if |w|=1. Wait, yes, because if w = e^{i\u03b8}, then 1/w = e^{-i\u03b8} = conjugate(w). \n\nTherefore, the expression is A w + B conjugate(w). Since conjugate(w) = 1/w. \n\nTherefore, the real part of A w + B conjugate(w). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write this in terms of vectors or use calculus to maximize. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps consider the expression as a function of \u03b8, which we have already done, and found that the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, which has maximum sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2)=540. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of this as a linear combination of cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8, so writing it as R cos(\u03b8 + \u03c6), where R is the amplitude. The maximum is R. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is an error here. Let me see. Suppose the real part is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Let me compute its maximum. \n\nYes, the maximum value is indeed the square root of (324)^2 + (-432)^2, so that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the sign. Let me see, since the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, so when written as A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, B here is -432. \n\nTherefore, the amplitude is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 + ( -432)^2) = same as before. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but let me see if there's another way to check this. Suppose we set derivative to zero? \n\nLet me consider f(\u03b8) = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. To find maximum, take derivative:\n\nf\u2019(\u03b8) = -324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8. Setting to zero:\n\n-324 sin\u03b8 -432 cos\u03b8 =0 \u2192 324 sin\u03b8 +432 cos\u03b8 =0 \u2192 \n\ntan\u03b8 = -432/324 = -4/3. \n\nWait, let me compute 432 divided by 324. \n\n432/324 = 4/3 (since 432 \u00f7 108 =4, 324 \u00f7108=3). So tan\u03b8 = -4/3. \n\nTherefore, the critical points are at \u03b8 where tan\u03b8 = -4/3. \n\nSo, let me compute the value of f(\u03b8) at this angle. Let me suppose \u03b8 is in the fourth quadrant where tan\u03b8 = -4/3. \n\nLet me compute sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8. Let\u2019s suppose that tan\u03b8 = -4/3. Let me take \u03b8 such that cos\u03b8 = 3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5 (since tan\u03b8 = sin/cos = -4/3, so in fourth quadrant). Alternatively, if in second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5 and sin\u03b8 =4/5. \n\nWait, but to get tan\u03b8 = -4/3, the angle could be in second or fourth quadrant. Let me check both possibilities. \n\nFirst, let's take the fourth quadrant angle where cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5. Then f(\u03b8) = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = (972 +1728)/5 = 2700/5 = 540. \n\nAlternatively, in second quadrant, cos\u03b8 = -3/5, sin\u03b8 =4/5. Then f(\u03b8) = 324*(-3/5) -432*(4/5) = (-972/5) - (1728/5) = (-2700)/5 = -540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum is indeed 540, achieved when cos\u03b8 = 3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5, i.e., \u03b8 in fourth quadrant. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nWait, but just to confirm, let me plug in \u03b8 where cos\u03b8 = 3/5, sin\u03b8 = -4/5 into the original expression. Let me see if that gives the real part 540. \n\nLet me compute the real part expression:\n\n324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 = 324*(3/5) -432*(-4/5) = (972/5) + (1728/5) = 2700/5 = 540. So that's correct. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of the original expression. Let me choose z such that z =4e^{i\u03b8} where \u03b8 is such that cos\u03b8=3/5 and sin\u03b8 = -4/5. \n\nSo z =4*(3/5 -4i/5) = (12/5 -16i/5). \n\nLet me compute (75+117i)z + (96+144i)/z. \n\nFirst compute (75+117i)z:\n\nz = (12/5 -16i/5). \n\nMultiply by (75 +117i):\n\nFirst, 75*(12/5) = 75*(12)/5 = 15*12 = 180\n\n75*(-16i/5) = -240i\n\n117i*(12/5) = (1404/5)i\n\n117i*(-16i/5) = - (1872/5)i\u00b2 = +1872/5 since i\u00b2 =-1.\n\nAdding these terms:\n\nReal parts: 180 + 1872/5 = (900 +1872)/5 = 2772/5\n\nImaginary parts: -240i + (1404/5)i = (-1200/5 +1404/5)i = (204/5)i\n\nSo first term: (2772/5) + (204/5)i\n\nSecond term: (96 +144i)/z. Since z = (12/5 -16i/5), so 1/z = conjugate(z)/|z|\u00b2. Since |z|=4, |z|\u00b2=16. \n\nConjugate(z) is 12/5 +16i/5. Therefore, 1/z = (12/5 +16i/5)/16 = (12 +16i)/80 = (3 +4i)/20.\n\nTherefore, (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(3 +4i)/20.\n\nLet me compute (96 +144i)(3 +4i):\n\nFirst, 96*3 =288\n\n96*4i = 384i\n\n144i*3 = 432i\n\n144i*4i = 576i\u00b2 = -576\n\nAdding all terms:\n\nReal parts: 288 -576 = -288\n\nImaginary parts: 384i +432i = 816i\n\nTherefore, the second term is (-288 +816i)/20 = (-288/20) + (816/20)i = -14.4 +40.8i\n\nAdding the first term and the second term:\n\nFirst term: (2772/5) \u2248 554.4 + (204/5)i \u224840.8i\n\nSecond term: -14.4 +40.8i\n\nAdding real parts: 554.4 -14.4 = 540\n\nImaginary parts: 40.8i +40.8i =81.6i. \n\nSo the total expression is 540 +81.6i. Therefore, the real part is indeed 540. \n\nTherefore, the maximum real part is 540. \n\nTherefore, I think that is correct. \n\nWait, but just to check another angle. Suppose \u03b8 is such that tan\u03b8 = -4/3 but in another quadrant. Wait, but we saw that when in the fourth quadrant, we get the maximum. \n\nAlternatively, maybe another angle gives a higher value? Let me see. Suppose \u03b8=0, then cos\u03b8=1, sin\u03b8=0. Then real part is 324*1 -432*0 =324. Which is less than 540. \n\nIf \u03b8= \u03c0/2, then cos\u03b8=0, sin\u03b8=1. Real part is 0 -432*1 = -432. \n\nIf \u03b8= \u03c0, cos\u03b8 = -1, sin\u03b8=0, real part is -324. \n\n\u03b8= 3\u03c0/2, cos\u03b8=0, sin\u03b8=-1. Real part is 0 -432*(-1)=432. \n\nSo indeed the maximum seems to be 540. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be 540.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n\n\nTo find the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), we start by expressing \\(z\\) in polar form.

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers and maximizing the real part... Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, that means z can be represented in polar form. Let me recall that any complex number z can be written as z = re^{i\u03b8}, where r is the modulus and \u03b8 is the argument. Here, r is given as 4, so z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. But maybe it's better to write z in terms of sine and cosine for easier manipulation later? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since we have 1/z in the expression, maybe using the reciprocal in polar form would be helpful. Remember that 1/z for z = re^{i\u03b8} is (1/r)e^{-i\u03b8}. So, since |z|=4, then |1/z| = 1/4. So, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Hmm, that might be useful.\n\nThe expression we need to maximize is Re[(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z]. Let me denote this real part as Re[ (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z ]. To maximize this, perhaps I can express everything in terms of \u03b8 and then take the derivative with respect to \u03b8, set it to zero? That might work, but it could get a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use some optimization techniques with complex numbers?\n\nWait, another thought: since we need the real part, maybe we can separate the real and imaginary parts of the entire expression, then focus on the real part. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me first write z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so that 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Then, substituting into the expression:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo, adding them together:\n\n(75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor out some common terms here? Let's see:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, maybe I can write both terms in terms of e^{i\u03b8} and e^{-i\u03b8}, but I need to compute their real parts. Alternatively, let me compute each part separately.\n\nLet me denote the first term as A = (75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} and the second term as B = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}. Then, the entire expression is A + B, and we need Re(A + B). Since Re(A + B) = Re(A) + Re(B), so I can compute the real parts separately.\n\nLet me compute Re(A):\n\nFirst, expand A: 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8}\n\nLet me write e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8. So multiplying out:\n\n4*(75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)\n\nLet me compute that multiplication:\n\nFirst, 75*cos\u03b8 + 75i sin\u03b8 + 117i cos\u03b8 + 117i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nBut i^2 = -1, so:\n\n75 cos\u03b8 + 75i sin\u03b8 + 117i cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8\n\nSo grouping real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary part: 75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8\n\nMultiply this by 4:\n\nSo Re(A) = 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8)\n\nSimilarly, compute Re(B):\n\nB = (24 + 36i)*e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nAgain, e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8. Multiply out:\n\n24*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) + 36i*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)\n\n= 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nReal parts: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 (since -i^2 is +1)\n\nImaginary parts: -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8\n\nTherefore, Re(B) = 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nTherefore, the total real part Re(A + B) = Re(A) + Re(B) = 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8)\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, expand 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8):\n\n4*75 cos\u03b8 = 300 cos\u03b8\n\n4*(-117 sin\u03b8) = -468 sin\u03b8\n\nAdding the Re(B) terms:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nSo total:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ncos\u03b8 terms: 300 +24 = 324 cos\u03b8\n\nsin\u03b8 terms: -468 + 36 = -432 sin\u03b8\n\nTherefore, Re(A + B) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8\n\nHmm, so the real part simplifies to 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. Now, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of this expression over all \u03b8. That's a trigonometric expression of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, which has a maximum of sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Wait, is that right?\n\nYes, I remember that the maximum of C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 is sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2). Let me confirm that. The formula is that for any real numbers C and D, the expression C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6), where R = sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2) and tan\u03c6 = D/C. Therefore, the maximum value is R. So in this case, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. So A = 324, B = -432. Therefore, the maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared: 324^2. Let's see, 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14400. So (300 +24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 +24\u00b2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104, 976. Wait, 90000 +14400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976. So 324\u00b2 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared: 400\u00b2 = 160,000, 32\u00b2 = 1,024, cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 +32)^2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*32 +32\u00b2 = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 186,624. But since it's (-432)^2, same as 432\u00b2, so 186,624.\n\nAdding them together: 104,976 + 186,624 = let's see, 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000, then 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So total is 291,600? Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, 104,976 + 186,624:\n\n104,976 + 186,624:\n\n100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000\n\n4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600\n\nSo total is 280,000 + 11,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600). Hmm, sqrt(291,600). Let me see, sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916)*sqrt(100) = 54 *10 = 540. Because 54 squared is 2916 (since 50\u00b2=2500, 5\u00b2=25, cross term 2*50*5=500; (50+5)^2=2500+500+25=3025. Wait, that's 55\u00b2. Wait, 54\u00b2 is (50+4)^2=2500 + 400 + 16 = 2916. Yes, so sqrt(2916) is 54. Therefore sqrt(291600) is 540. So the maximum is 540. Wait, but hold on: the expression was 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. The formula is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) where A is 324 and B is -432. So sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2) = sqrt(291,600)=540. So that would be the maximum. Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540? Hmm, but let me check if I did all steps correctly.\n\nWait, let me go back through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying the expression.\n\nOriginal expression: Re[(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] with |z|=4.\n\nExpressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nFirst term: (75+117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75+117i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96+144i)/z = (96+144i)*(1/(4 e^{i\u03b8})) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nThen, Re(A + B) where A is the first term and B is the second term.\n\nCalculating Re(A):\n\nA = 4*(75+117i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 4*[75cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8 + i(75 sin\u03b8 +117 cos\u03b8)]\n\nSo the real part of A is 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) which is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. Wait, but earlier I had 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8? Wait, maybe miscalculation here.\n\nWait, wait, hold on, when I combined the terms, I think I messed up.\n\nWait, after expanding Re(A) + Re(B):\n\nRe(A) = 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nRe(B) = 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nSo adding them together: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 = (300+24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. That's correct.\n\nThen, yes, the coefficients are 324 and -432, so sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = 540. So that would be the maximum. So then the answer should be 540? Hmm, but let me think again.\n\nWait, but is there a possibility that when we consider the entire expression, maybe there are constraints or something I missed? Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, there might be some conditions. Wait, but here we just need the real part of the sum, so converting to real functions of \u03b8 is okay, and then maximizing the trigonometric function. So seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think in terms of vectors. The expression 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 can be represented as the dot product of the vector (324, -432) with the unit vector (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). The maximum value is the magnitude of the vector, which is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2), which is exactly what we had before. So that's another way to see it. So that confirms the maximum is indeed 540. Hmm, so is that the answer?\n\nWait, but let me check if there was a miscalculation in expanding the terms. Let me redo the expansion step again.\n\nStarting from Re(A + B):\n\nFirst term (A):\n\n(75 + 117i)z with z =4e^{i\u03b8}:\n\nMultiply (75 + 117i) by 4e^{i\u03b8}:\n\nFirst, 75*4 = 300, 117i*4 = 468i, so (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nThen, the real part of this term is 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 (since Re[(a + ib)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)] = a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8). So that's correct.\n\nSecond term (B):\n\n(96 +144i)/z = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo expanding that, (24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8):\n\nReal part is 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 (since the real part is 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 because the imaginary parts would be -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8, but we only take real parts here). So that's correct.\n\nAdding the real parts gives 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Correct.\n\nSo the maximum of that is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2). Wait, hold on, is it sqrt( (324)^2 + ( -432)^2 ), yes, which is sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2). Wait, but 324 and 432 have a common factor. Let me see if that can be simplified. 324 divided by 108 is 3, 432 divided by 108 is 4. Wait, 324 = 108 * 3, 432 = 108 * 4. So sqrt( (108)^2*(3^2 +4^2) ) = 108 *5 = 540. Exactly, so that's why it's 540. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so that seems solid. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. Wait, but before I conclude, let me think if there's an alternative way where maybe the maximum isn't achieved at that angle? Because sometimes in optimization over complex numbers, especially with reciprocal terms, there might be constraints or something else. Let me see.\n\nWait, the problem states z is a complex number with |z| =4, so z \u22600. So as long as z is on the circle of radius 4, then 1/z is on the circle of radius 1/4. But since we're taking real parts, maybe there's no issue here. The expression is smooth everywhere except z=0, which is excluded. So the maximum should indeed be 540. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the sign? Let me see. The expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. So when we compute the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, the formula is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). The sign of B doesn't matter because it's squared. So even if B is negative, the square is positive, so the maximum is still sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ), which is indeed 540. So that's correct.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the real parts? Let me recheck the first term's real part again.\n\nFirst term: (75 +117i) * z where z is 4e^{i\u03b8}:\n\nLet me write (75 +117i) as a complex number. Multiplying by z (which is 4e^{i\u03b8}), so scaling by 4 and rotating by \u03b8. Then, taking the real part of that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps writing (75 + 117i) as a vector in the complex plane. The real part of (75 +117i)*z is the dot product of the vector (75,117) with the vector (4 cos\u03b8, 4 sin\u03b8). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, actually, the real part of (a + ib)(c + id) is ac - bd. So if (75 +117i) is multiplied by z = 4 cos\u03b8 +4i sin\u03b8, then the real part is 75*(4 cos\u03b8) - 117*(4 sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8. Which matches what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the second term (96 +144i)/z. Let me see, since 1/z is (1/(4 e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). Therefore, multiplying (96 +144i) by that gives (96 +144i)*(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8)/4. The real part is [96 cos\u03b8 +144 sin\u03b8]/4? Wait, let me compute it again:\n\n(96 +144i)*(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8) = 96 cos\u03b8 -96 i sin\u03b8 +144i cos\u03b8 -144i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\n\n= 96 cos\u03b8 +144 sin\u03b8 + i(-96 sin\u03b8 +144 cos\u03b8)\n\nTherefore, real part is 96 cos\u03b8 +144 sin\u03b8. Then divide by 4 (since 1/z has a 1/4 factor):\n\nWait, hold on, the second term is (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/(4 e^{i\u03b8})) = (96 +144i)*(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8)/4. So the real part is [96 cos\u03b8 +144 sin\u03b8]/4. Wait, so that would be (96/4) cos\u03b8 + (144/4) sin\u03b8 =24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. Which is exactly what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, all steps check out. Therefore, the maximum real part is indeed 540. Therefore, the answer is 540. Wait, but let me see if that makes sense. Let me plug in \u03b8 where the maximum occurs. Let me see, to confirm, the maximum occurs when the angle \u03b8 is such that the vector (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) is in the same direction as (324, -432). So the angle \u03c6 where tan\u03c6 = (-432)/324 = -4/3. Wait, but since the coefficients are A=324, B=-432, so the angle \u03c6 is arctan(B/A) = arctan(-432/324) = arctan(-4/3). Hmm, so \u03b8 should be equal to \u03c6? Wait, the maximum occurs when cos\u03b8 = A / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) and sin\u03b8 = B / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, actually, let's recall the formula:\n\nThe expression A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 can be written as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), where R = sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), and tan\u03b4 = B/A. Wait, actually, let me get that straight. Let me recall the identity:\n\nA cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 = R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), where R = sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), and \u03b4 = arctan(B/A). Wait, but actually, it's better to think of \u03b4 as the angle such that cos\u03b4 = A/R and sin\u03b4 = B/R. Therefore, if our expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, then that can be written as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), where R is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) =540, and cos\u03b4 = 324/540, sin\u03b4 = -432/540. Therefore, \u03b4 is in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, the maximum value is indeed R =540, achieved when \u03b8 = \u03b4. Therefore, the maximum is achievable, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The largest possible real part is 540. So the final answer is \\boxed{540}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the largest possible real part of the expression (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z where z is a complex number with |z| = 4. Hmm, complex numbers and maximizing the real part... Alright, let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since z is a complex number with |z| = 4, that means z can be represented in polar form. Let me recall that any complex number z can be written as z = re^{i\u03b8}, where r is the modulus and \u03b8 is the argument. Here, r is given as 4, so z = 4e^{i\u03b8}. But maybe it's better to write z in terms of sine and cosine for easier manipulation later? Let's see.\n\nAlternatively, since we have 1/z in the expression, maybe using the reciprocal in polar form would be helpful. Remember that 1/z for z = re^{i\u03b8} is (1/r)e^{-i\u03b8}. So, since |z|=4, then |1/z| = 1/4. So, 1/z would be (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Hmm, that might be useful.\n\nThe expression we need to maximize is Re[(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z]. Let me denote this real part as Re[ (75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z ]. To maximize this, perhaps I can express everything in terms of \u03b8 and then take the derivative with respect to \u03b8, set it to zero? That might work, but it could get a bit messy. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use some optimization techniques with complex numbers?\n\nWait, another thought: since we need the real part, maybe we can separate the real and imaginary parts of the entire expression, then focus on the real part. Let me try that approach.\n\nLet me first write z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so that 1/z = (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}. Then, substituting into the expression:\n\nFirst term: (75 + 117i)z = (75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96 + 144i)/z = (96 + 144i)*(1/4)e^{-i\u03b8} = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo, adding them together:\n\n(75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} + (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, perhaps I can factor out some common terms here? Let's see:\n\nFirst term: 4*(75 + 117i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nHmm, maybe I can write both terms in terms of e^{i\u03b8} and e^{-i\u03b8}, but I need to compute their real parts. Alternatively, let me compute each part separately.\n\nLet me denote the first term as A = (75 + 117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} and the second term as B = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}. Then, the entire expression is A + B, and we need Re(A + B). Since Re(A + B) = Re(A) + Re(B), so I can compute the real parts separately.\n\nLet me compute Re(A):\n\nFirst, expand A: 4*(75 + 117i)*e^{i\u03b8}\n\nLet me write e^{i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8. So multiplying out:\n\n4*(75 + 117i)*(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)\n\nLet me compute that multiplication:\n\nFirst, 75*cos\u03b8 + 75i sin\u03b8 + 117i cos\u03b8 + 117i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nBut i^2 = -1, so:\n\n75 cos\u03b8 + 75i sin\u03b8 + 117i cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8\n\nSo grouping real and imaginary parts:\n\nReal part: 75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8\n\nImaginary part: 75 sin\u03b8 + 117 cos\u03b8\n\nMultiply this by 4:\n\nSo Re(A) = 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8)\n\nSimilarly, compute Re(B):\n\nB = (24 + 36i)*e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nAgain, e^{-i\u03b8} = cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8. Multiply out:\n\n24*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8) + 36i*(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8)\n\n= 24 cos\u03b8 - 24i sin\u03b8 + 36i cos\u03b8 - 36i^2 sin\u03b8\n\nSimplify terms:\n\nReal parts: 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8 (since -i^2 is +1)\n\nImaginary parts: -24 sin\u03b8 + 36 cos\u03b8\n\nTherefore, Re(B) = 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nTherefore, the total real part Re(A + B) = Re(A) + Re(B) = 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) + (24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8)\n\nLet me compute this:\n\nFirst, expand 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8):\n\n4*75 cos\u03b8 = 300 cos\u03b8\n\n4*(-117 sin\u03b8) = -468 sin\u03b8\n\nAdding the Re(B) terms:\n\n24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nSo total:\n\n300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8 + 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ncos\u03b8 terms: 300 +24 = 324 cos\u03b8\n\nsin\u03b8 terms: -468 + 36 = -432 sin\u03b8\n\nTherefore, Re(A + B) = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8\n\nHmm, so the real part simplifies to 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. Now, the problem reduces to finding the maximum value of this expression over all \u03b8. That's a trigonometric expression of the form A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, which has a maximum of sqrt(A^2 + B^2). Wait, is that right?\n\nYes, I remember that the maximum of C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 is sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2). Let me confirm that. The formula is that for any real numbers C and D, the expression C cos\u03b8 + D sin\u03b8 can be rewritten as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03c6), where R = sqrt(C\u00b2 + D\u00b2) and tan\u03c6 = D/C. Therefore, the maximum value is R. So in this case, the expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. So A = 324, B = -432. Therefore, the maximum is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2). Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, compute 324 squared: 324^2. Let's see, 300^2 = 90000, 24^2 = 576, and cross term 2*300*24 = 14400. So (300 +24)^2 = 300\u00b2 + 2*300*24 +24\u00b2 = 90000 + 14400 + 576 = 104, 976. Wait, 90000 +14400 is 104,400, plus 576 is 104,976. So 324\u00b2 = 104,976.\n\nSimilarly, 432 squared: 400\u00b2 = 160,000, 32\u00b2 = 1,024, cross term 2*400*32 = 25,600. So (400 +32)^2 = 400\u00b2 + 2*400*32 +32\u00b2 = 160,000 +25,600 +1,024 = 186,624. But since it's (-432)^2, same as 432\u00b2, so 186,624.\n\nAdding them together: 104,976 + 186,624 = let's see, 100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000, then 4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600. So total is 291,600? Wait, let me check again:\n\nWait, 104,976 + 186,624:\n\n104,976 + 186,624:\n\n100,000 + 180,000 = 280,000\n\n4,976 + 6,624 = 11,600\n\nSo total is 280,000 + 11,600 = 291,600. So sqrt(291,600). Hmm, sqrt(291,600). Let me see, sqrt(2916 * 100) = sqrt(2916)*sqrt(100) = 54 *10 = 540. Because 54 squared is 2916 (since 50\u00b2=2500, 5\u00b2=25, cross term 2*50*5=500; (50+5)^2=2500+500+25=3025. Wait, that's 55\u00b2. Wait, 54\u00b2 is (50+4)^2=2500 + 400 + 16 = 2916. Yes, so sqrt(2916) is 54. Therefore sqrt(291600) is 540. So the maximum is 540. Wait, but hold on: the expression was 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. The formula is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) where A is 324 and B is -432. So sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2) = sqrt(291,600)=540. So that would be the maximum. Therefore, the largest possible real part is 540? Hmm, but let me check if I did all steps correctly.\n\nWait, let me go back through the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying the expression.\n\nOriginal expression: Re[(75 + 117i)z + (96 + 144i)/z] with |z|=4.\n\nExpressed z as 4e^{i\u03b8}, so 1/z is (1/4)e^{-i\u03b8}.\n\nFirst term: (75+117i)*4e^{i\u03b8} = 4*(75+117i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nSecond term: (96+144i)/z = (96+144i)*(1/(4 e^{i\u03b8})) = (24 + 36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nThen, Re(A + B) where A is the first term and B is the second term.\n\nCalculating Re(A):\n\nA = 4*(75+117i)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8) = 4*[75cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8 + i(75 sin\u03b8 +117 cos\u03b8)]\n\nSo the real part of A is 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) which is 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8. Wait, but earlier I had 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8? Wait, maybe miscalculation here.\n\nWait, wait, hold on, when I combined the terms, I think I messed up.\n\nWait, after expanding Re(A) + Re(B):\n\nRe(A) = 4*(75 cos\u03b8 - 117 sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 - 468 sin\u03b8\n\nRe(B) = 24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8\n\nSo adding them together: 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 = (300+24)cos\u03b8 + (-468 +36) sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. That's correct.\n\nThen, yes, the coefficients are 324 and -432, so sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) = 540. So that would be the maximum. So then the answer should be 540? Hmm, but let me think again.\n\nWait, but is there a possibility that when we consider the entire expression, maybe there are constraints or something I missed? Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, there might be some conditions. Wait, but here we just need the real part of the sum, so converting to real functions of \u03b8 is okay, and then maximizing the trigonometric function. So seems okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think in terms of vectors. The expression 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8 can be represented as the dot product of the vector (324, -432) with the unit vector (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8). The maximum value is the magnitude of the vector, which is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2), which is exactly what we had before. So that's another way to see it. So that confirms the maximum is indeed 540. Hmm, so is that the answer?\n\nWait, but let me check if there was a miscalculation in expanding the terms. Let me redo the expansion step again.\n\nStarting from Re(A + B):\n\nFirst term (A):\n\n(75 + 117i)z with z =4e^{i\u03b8}:\n\nMultiply (75 + 117i) by 4e^{i\u03b8}:\n\nFirst, 75*4 = 300, 117i*4 = 468i, so (300 + 468i)e^{i\u03b8}\n\nThen, the real part of this term is 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 (since Re[(a + ib)(cos\u03b8 + i sin\u03b8)] = a cos\u03b8 - b sin\u03b8). So that's correct.\n\nSecond term (B):\n\n(96 +144i)/z = (24 +36i)e^{-i\u03b8}\n\nSo expanding that, (24 +36i)(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8):\n\nReal part is 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 (since the real part is 24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 because the imaginary parts would be -24 sin\u03b8 +36 cos\u03b8, but we only take real parts here). So that's correct.\n\nAdding the real parts gives 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8 +24 cos\u03b8 +36 sin\u03b8 = 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8. Correct.\n\nSo the maximum of that is sqrt(324\u00b2 +432\u00b2). Wait, hold on, is it sqrt( (324)^2 + ( -432)^2 ), yes, which is sqrt(324\u00b2 + 432\u00b2). Wait, but 324 and 432 have a common factor. Let me see if that can be simplified. 324 divided by 108 is 3, 432 divided by 108 is 4. Wait, 324 = 108 * 3, 432 = 108 * 4. So sqrt( (108)^2*(3^2 +4^2) ) = 108 *5 = 540. Exactly, so that's why it's 540. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so that seems solid. Therefore, the maximum real part is 540. Wait, but before I conclude, let me think if there's an alternative way where maybe the maximum isn't achieved at that angle? Because sometimes in optimization over complex numbers, especially with reciprocal terms, there might be constraints or something else. Let me see.\n\nWait, the problem states z is a complex number with |z| =4, so z \u22600. So as long as z is on the circle of radius 4, then 1/z is on the circle of radius 1/4. But since we're taking real parts, maybe there's no issue here. The expression is smooth everywhere except z=0, which is excluded. So the maximum should indeed be 540. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the sign? Let me see. The expression is 324 cos\u03b8 - 432 sin\u03b8. So when we compute the maximum of A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8, the formula is sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). The sign of B doesn't matter because it's squared. So even if B is negative, the square is positive, so the maximum is still sqrt( (324)^2 + (432)^2 ), which is indeed 540. So that's correct.\n\nWait another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the real parts? Let me recheck the first term's real part again.\n\nFirst term: (75 +117i) * z where z is 4e^{i\u03b8}:\n\nLet me write (75 +117i) as a complex number. Multiplying by z (which is 4e^{i\u03b8}), so scaling by 4 and rotating by \u03b8. Then, taking the real part of that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps writing (75 + 117i) as a vector in the complex plane. The real part of (75 +117i)*z is the dot product of the vector (75,117) with the vector (4 cos\u03b8, 4 sin\u03b8). Wait, is that correct?\n\nWait, actually, the real part of (a + ib)(c + id) is ac - bd. So if (75 +117i) is multiplied by z = 4 cos\u03b8 +4i sin\u03b8, then the real part is 75*(4 cos\u03b8) - 117*(4 sin\u03b8) = 300 cos\u03b8 -468 sin\u03b8. Which matches what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nSimilarly, the second term (96 +144i)/z. Let me see, since 1/z is (1/(4 e^{i\u03b8})) = (1/4)(cos\u03b8 - i sin\u03b8). Therefore, multiplying (96 +144i) by that gives (96 +144i)*(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8)/4. The real part is [96 cos\u03b8 +144 sin\u03b8]/4? Wait, let me compute it again:\n\n(96 +144i)*(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8) = 96 cos\u03b8 -96 i sin\u03b8 +144i cos\u03b8 -144i\u00b2 sin\u03b8\n\n= 96 cos\u03b8 +144 sin\u03b8 + i(-96 sin\u03b8 +144 cos\u03b8)\n\nTherefore, real part is 96 cos\u03b8 +144 sin\u03b8. Then divide by 4 (since 1/z has a 1/4 factor):\n\nWait, hold on, the second term is (96 +144i)/z = (96 +144i)*(1/(4 e^{i\u03b8})) = (96 +144i)*(cos\u03b8 -i sin\u03b8)/4. So the real part is [96 cos\u03b8 +144 sin\u03b8]/4. Wait, so that would be (96/4) cos\u03b8 + (144/4) sin\u03b8 =24 cos\u03b8 + 36 sin\u03b8. Which is exactly what I had before. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, all steps check out. Therefore, the maximum real part is indeed 540. Therefore, the answer is 540. Wait, but let me see if that makes sense. Let me plug in \u03b8 where the maximum occurs. Let me see, to confirm, the maximum occurs when the angle \u03b8 is such that the vector (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8) is in the same direction as (324, -432). So the angle \u03c6 where tan\u03c6 = (-432)/324 = -4/3. Wait, but since the coefficients are A=324, B=-432, so the angle \u03c6 is arctan(B/A) = arctan(-432/324) = arctan(-4/3). Hmm, so \u03b8 should be equal to \u03c6? Wait, the maximum occurs when cos\u03b8 = A / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2) and sin\u03b8 = B / sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2). Wait, actually, let's recall the formula:\n\nThe expression A cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 can be written as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), where R = sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), and tan\u03b4 = B/A. Wait, actually, let me get that straight. Let me recall the identity:\n\nA cos\u03b8 + B sin\u03b8 = R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), where R = sqrt(A\u00b2 + B\u00b2), and \u03b4 = arctan(B/A). Wait, but actually, it's better to think of \u03b4 as the angle such that cos\u03b4 = A/R and sin\u03b4 = B/R. Therefore, if our expression is 324 cos\u03b8 -432 sin\u03b8, then that can be written as R cos(\u03b8 - \u03b4), where R is sqrt(324\u00b2 + (-432)^2) =540, and cos\u03b4 = 324/540, sin\u03b4 = -432/540. Therefore, \u03b4 is in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, the maximum value is indeed R =540, achieved when \u03b8 = \u03b4. Therefore, the maximum is achievable, so that's correct.\n\nTherefore, I think my answer is correct. The largest possible real part is 540. So the final answer is \\boxed{540}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{540}\n\n\nGiven the problem of finding the largest possible real part of the expression \\((75 + 117i)z + \\frac{96 + 144i}{z}\\) where \\(z\\) is a complex number with \\(|z| = 4\\), we proceed as follows:\n\n1. **Express \\(z\\) in polar form**: Since \\(|z| = 4\\), we can write \\(z = 4e^{i\\theta}\\).
