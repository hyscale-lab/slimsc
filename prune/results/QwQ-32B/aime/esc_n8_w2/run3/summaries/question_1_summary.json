      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this system of logarithmic equations with three variables x, y, and z. The problem gives me three equations involving log base 2 of ratios of these variables, and I need to find the absolute value of another logarithm expression involving x, y, z. Then, express that as a reduced fraction m/n and find m + n. Hmm, let's start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nAnd the target is |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|, which they say is m/n in simplest terms. So, first, maybe I can convert these logarithmic equations into exponential form to get expressions for x, y, z?\n\nLet me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x/(y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y/(x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z/(x y)\n\nHmm, so now I have three equations:\n\nEquation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z\n\nEquation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z\n\nEquation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nHmm, so each variable is expressed in terms of the product of the other two multiplied by some power of 2. This seems a bit circular. Maybe I can substitute one into another?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps taking the logarithm expressions and manipulating them as equations. Since all logs are base 2, maybe adding or subtracting the equations could help? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe express each variable in terms of others and substitute step by step. Let me try substitution first.\n\nStarting with equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let me plug this expression for x into equation 2.\n\nEquation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z. Substitute x:\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * [2^(1/2) * y z] * z\n\nSimplify inside the brackets first: 2^(1/2) * y z * z = 2^(1/2) * y z\u00b2\n\nTherefore, y = 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/2) * y z\u00b2\n\nMultiply the exponents with same base: 2^(1/3 + 1/2) * y z\u00b2\n\nCompute 1/3 + 1/2. Let's see, common denominator is 6, so 2/6 + 3/6 = 5/6. So 2^(5/6).\n\nThus, equation becomes: y = 2^(5/6) * y z\u00b2\n\nHmm, so we can divide both sides by y (since y is positive, so not zero):\n\n1 = 2^(5/6) * z\u00b2\n\nTherefore, z\u00b2 = 1 / 2^(5/6) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTake square roots: z = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive, we don't need to worry about the negative root.\n\nSo z = 2^(-5/12). Okay, that's z in terms of 2 to some exponent. Now, let's see if we can find y and x.\n\nLet me note that down: z = 2^(-5/12). Let's keep this in mind.\n\nNow, go back to equation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y. Since we know z, perhaps we can express x y in terms of z?\n\nWait, equation 3 says z = 2^(1/4) * x y, so rearranged: x y = z / 2^(1/4) = [2^(-5/12)] / 2^(1/4) = 2^(-5/12 - 3/12) = 2^(-8/12) = 2^(-2/3). So x y = 2^(-2/3).\n\nHmm, okay. Let's see if we can find another equation involving x and y. Let's go back to equation 1 and equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 1, x = 2^(1/2) * y z. We can plug z here:\n\nx = 2^(1/2) * y * 2^(-5/12) = 2^(1/2 -5/12) * y\n\nCompute exponent: 1/2 is 6/12, so 6/12 -5/12 = 1/12. Thus x = 2^(1/12) * y\n\nSo x is 2^(1/12) times y. Let me write that as x = 2^(1/12) y.\n\nSo now, since we have x in terms of y, and we have x y = 2^(-2/3), let's substitute x here.\n\nx y = (2^(1/12) y) * y = 2^(1/12) y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3)\n\nTherefore, 2^(1/12) y\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3)\n\nDivide both sides by 2^(1/12):\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(-2/3 -1/12) = 2^(-8/12 -1/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive, that's the value.\n\nSo y = 2^(-3/8). Then x is 2^(1/12) * y = 2^(1/12) * 2^(-3/8) = 2^(1/12 - 3/8).\n\nCompute exponent: 1/12 - 3/8. Let's convert to 24 denominator: 2/24 - 9/24 = -7/24. So exponent is -7/24. Therefore x = 2^(-7/24).\n\nSo now, we have expressions for x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24),\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24).\n\nWait, let me check that:\n\nWait, 3/8 is 9/24, yes, and 5/12 is 10/24. So, in terms of exponents over 24:\n\nx: -7/24,\n\ny: -9/24,\n\nz: -10/24.\n\nHmm, okay, seems consistent.\n\nNow, the target is |log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2)|. Let me compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2).\n\nFirst, using logarithm properties, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z.\n\nSince log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) is equal to that sum, so let's compute each term.\n\nGiven that x = 2^(-7/24), so log\u2082x = -7/24,\n\nSimilarly log\u2082y = -9/24,\n\nlog\u2082z = -10/24.\n\nTherefore:\n\n4 log\u2082x = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3 log\u2082y = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24,\n\n2 log\u2082z = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -75/24. Taking absolute value gives 75/24.\n\nBut 75 and 24 have common factors. Let me see, 75 is 25*3, 24 is 8*3, so divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n75/24 = 25/8. Wait, 75 \u00f73 is 25, 24 \u00f73 is 8. So yes, simplified, it's 25/8. Therefore the absolute value is 25/8, so m is 25, n is 8, which are coprime. So m + n is 33.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all steps to be sure. Let me check the exponents again.\n\nStarting with log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2. Let me verify with the found x, y, z.\n\nCompute x/(y z):\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny z = 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-19/24),\n\nThus x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^{(-7 +19)/24} = 2^{12/24} = 2^{1/2}, which is sqrt(2), so log\u2082 of that is 1/2. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, check equation 2: log\u2082(y/(x z)) = 1/3.\n\nCompute y/(x z):\n\ny = 2^(-9/24),\n\nx z = 2^(-7/24)*2^(-10/24) = 2^(-17/24),\n\nThus y/(x z) = 2^(-9/24)/2^(-17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3), so log\u2082 is 1/3. Correct.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)) =1/4.\n\nCompute z/(x y):\n\nz =2^(-10/24),\n\nx y =2^(-7/24)*2^(-9/24) =2^(-16/24),\n\nThus z/(x y) =2^(-10/24)/2^(-16/24)=2^(6/24)=2^(1/4), so log\u2082 is 1/4. Correct.\n\nAll equations check out. So the values of x, y, z are correctly found.\n\nTherefore, moving to the computation of log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2):\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) =4 log\u2082x +3 log\u2082y +2 log\u2082z.\n\nPlugging in exponents:\n\nlog\u2082x is exponent of x which is -7/24,\n\nlog\u2082y is -9/24,\n\nlog\u2082z is -10/24.\n\nSo:\n\n4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3*(-9/24)= -27/24,\n\n2*(-10/24)= -20/24,\n\nTotal sum: -28 -27 -20 = -75 over 24. So yes, that's -75/24. Absolute value is 75/24. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 75 \u00f73=25; 24 \u00f73=8. So 25/8. So m=25, n=8. They are coprime since 25 is 5\u00b2 and 8 is 2\u00b3, no common factors. So m + n = 33. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 33.\n\nBut let me just think again, perhaps there's a smarter way to do this without solving for x, y, z individually? Maybe by manipulating the equations?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the problem is asking for log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). Let me see if I can find the exponents in terms of the given equations.\n\nLet me denote the three original equations as equations (1), (2), (3):\n\n(1): log\u2082(x/(y z)) = 1/2,\n\n(2): log\u2082(y/(x z)) =1/3,\n\n(3): log\u2082(z/(x y)) =1/4.\n\nLet me write each equation as:\n\n(1): log\u2082 x - log\u2082(y z) =1/2,\n\nWhich is log\u2082x - (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) =1/2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(2): log\u2082y - (log\u2082x + log\u2082z) =1/3,\n\n(3): log\u2082z - (log\u2082x + log\u2082y) =1/4.\n\nLet me let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Then the equations become:\n\n(1): a - (b + c) =1/2,\n\n(2): b - (a + c) =1/3,\n\n(3): c - (a + b) =1/4.\n\nSo now we have a linear system in variables a, b, c. Let me write that out:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2,\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c =1/3,\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c =1/4.\n\nSo three equations:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2,\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nWe need to solve for a, b, c, then compute 4a + 3b + 2c, take absolute value, etc.\n\nThis might be a more straightforward algebraic approach. Let's try this method as a cross-check.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2,\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c =1/3,\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c =1/4.\n\nLet me add equations 1 and 2 first:\n\n( a - b - c ) + ( -a + b - c ) = (1/2 +1/3),\n\nLeft side: (a -a) + (-b + b) + (-c -c) = -2c,\n\nRight side: 5/6,\n\nThus -2c = 5/6 \u2192 c = -5/12.\n\nHmm, so c = -5/12. Wait, but c was log\u2082z, so log\u2082z = -5/12 \u21d2 z = 2^(-5/12), which matches the earlier result. Okay.\n\nNow, let's add equations 1 and 3:\n\nEquation1 + Equation3:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) =1/2 +1/4,\n\nLeft side: (a -a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = -2b,\n\nRight side: 3/4,\n\nThus -2b = 3/4 \u21d2 b = -3/8.\n\nAgain, that matches the earlier result for log\u2082y = -3/8. Good.\n\nSimilarly, let's add equations 2 and 3:\n\nEquation2 + Equation3:\n\n(-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) =1/3 +1/4,\n\nLeft side: (-a -a) + (b - b) + (-c + c) = -2a,\n\nRight side: 7/12,\n\nThus -2a =7/12 \u21d2 a = -7/24.\n\nWhich is exactly log\u2082x = -7/24, so that's consistent with previous results. So this method also gives the same a, b, c.\n\nTherefore, now, we can compute 4a +3b +2c.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n4a =4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3b =3*(-3/8) = -9/8 = -36/24,\n\n2c =2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -20/24,\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n-28/24 -36/24 -20/24 = (-28 -36 -20)/24 = (-84)/24? Wait a second, hold on, wait.\n\nWait, hold on, 4a +3b +2c:\n\nWait 4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3*(-3/8) is 3*(-3)/8 = -9/8. To convert to 24 denominator: -9/8 = (-27)/24,\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here in the previous step. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait 3b: since b is -3/8, so 3*(-3/8) = -9/8. To express over 24, multiply numerator and denominator by 3: -27/24.\n\nSimilarly 2c: c is -5/12, so 2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -10/12 = -5/6 = but over 24 denominator: -10/12 is equivalent to -20/24.\n\nTherefore, total:\n\n-28/24 (from 4a) + (-27/24 from 3b) + (-20/24 from 2c) = total numerator: -28 -27 -20 = -75. So -75/24, same as before. So absolute value is 75/24 =25/8. So same answer.\n\nSo this method confirms the previous result. Therefore, m + n is 25 +8 =33.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident the answer is 33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n",

Let me compute log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2).\n\nFirst, using logarithm properties, log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z.\n\nSince log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) is equal to that sum, so let's compute each term.\n\nGiven that x = 2^(-7/24), so log\u2082x = -7/24,\n\nSimilarly log\u2082y = -9/24,\n\nlog\u2082z = -10/24.\n\nTherefore:\n\n4 log\u2082x = 4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3 log\u2082y = 3*(-9/24) = -27/24,\n\n2 log\u2082z = 2*(-10/24) = -20/24.\n\nAdding them together:\n\n-28/24 -27/24 -20/24 = (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24.\n\nSo log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) = -75/24. Taking absolute value gives 75/24.\n\nBut 75 and 24 have common factors. Let me see, 75 is 25*3, 24 is 8*3, so divide numerator and denominator by 3:\n\n75/24 = 25/8. Wait, 75 \u00f73 is 25, 24 \u00f73 is 8. So yes, simplified, it's 25/8. Therefore the absolute value is 25/8, so m is 25, n is 8, which are coprime. So m + n is 33.\n\nWait, but let me double-check all steps to be sure. Let me check the exponents again.\n\nStarting with log\u2082(x/(yz)) = 1/2. Let me verify with the found x, y, z.\n\nCompute x/(y z):\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny z = 2^(-9/24) * 2^(-10/24) = 2^(-19/24),\n\nThus x/(y z) = 2^(-7/24) / 2^(-19/24) = 2^{(-7 +19)/24} = 2^{12/24} = 2^{1/2}, which is sqrt(2), so log\u2082 of that is 1/2. That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, check equation 2: log\u2082(y/(x z)) = 1/3.\n\nCompute y/(x z):\n\ny = 2^(-9/24),\n\nx z = 2^(-7/24)*2^(-10/24) = 2^(-17/24),\n\nThus y/(x z) = 2^(-9/24)/2^(-17/24) = 2^(8/24) = 2^(1/3), so log\u2082 is 1/3. Correct.\n\nThird equation: log\u2082(z/(x y)) =1/4.\n\nCompute z/(x y):\n\nz =2^(-10/24),\n\nx y =2^(-7/24)*2^(-9/24) =2^(-16/24),\n\nThus z/(x y) =2^(-10/24)/2^(-16/24)=2^(6/24)=2^(1/4), so log\u2082 is 1/4. Correct.\n\nAll equations check out. So the values of x, y, z are correctly found.\n\nTherefore, moving to the computation of log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2):\n\nlog\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2) =4 log\u2082x +3 log\u2082y +2 log\u2082z.\n\nPlugging in exponents:\n\nlog\u2082x is exponent of x which is -7/24,\n\nlog\u2082y is -9/24,\n\nlog\u2082z is -10/24.\n\nSo:\n\n4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3*(-9/24)= -27/24,\n\n2*(-10/24)= -20/24,\n\nTotal sum: -28 -27 -20 = -75 over 24. So yes, that's -75/24. Absolute value is 75/24. Simplify:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 3: 75 \u00f73=25; 24 \u00f73=8. So 25/8. So m=25, n=8. They are coprime since 25 is 5\u00b2 and 8 is 2\u00b3, no common factors. So m + n = 33. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is 33.\n\nBut let me just think again, perhaps there's a smarter way to do this without solving for x, y, z individually? Maybe by manipulating the equations?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the problem is asking for log\u2082(x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2). Let me see if I can find the exponents in terms of the given equations.\n\nLet me denote the three original equations as equations (1), (2), (3):\n\n(1): log\u2082(x/(y z)) = 1/2,\n\n(2): log\u2082(y/(x z)) =1/3,\n\n(3): log\u2082(z/(x y)) =1/4.\n\nLet me write each equation as:\n\n(1): log\u2082 x - log\u2082(y z) =1/2,\n\nWhich is log\u2082x - (log\u2082y + log\u2082z) =1/2,\n\nSimilarly,\n\n(2): log\u2082y - (log\u2082x + log\u2082z) =1/3,\n\n(3): log\u2082z - (log\u2082x + log\u2082y) =1/4.\n\nLet me let a = log\u2082x, b = log\u2082y, c = log\u2082z. Then the equations become:\n\n(1): a - (b + c) =1/2,\n\n(2): b - (a + c) =1/3,\n\n(3): c - (a + b) =1/4.\n\nSo now we have a linear system in variables a, b, c. Let me write that out:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2,\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c =1/3,\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c =1/4.\n\nSo three equations:\n\n1. a - b - c = 1/2,\n\n2. -a + b - c = 1/3,\n\n3. -a - b + c = 1/4.\n\nWe need to solve for a, b, c, then compute 4a + 3b + 2c, take absolute value, etc.\n\nThis might be a more straightforward algebraic approach. Let's try this method as a cross-check.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nEquation 1: a - b - c = 1/2,\n\nEquation 2: -a + b - c =1/3,\n\nEquation 3: -a - b + c =1/4.\n\nLet me add equations 1 and 2 first:\n\n( a - b - c ) + ( -a + b - c ) = (1/2 +1/3),\n\nLeft side: (a -a) + (-b + b) + (-c -c) = -2c,\n\nRight side: 5/6,\n\nThus -2c = 5/6 \u2192 c = -5/12.\n\nHmm, so c = -5/12. Wait, but c was log\u2082z, so log\u2082z = -5/12 \u21d2 z = 2^(-5/12), which matches the earlier result. Okay.\n\nNow, let's add equations 1 and 3:\n\nEquation1 + Equation3:\n\n(a - b - c) + (-a - b + c) =1/2 +1/4,\n\nLeft side: (a -a) + (-b - b) + (-c + c) = -2b,\n\nRight side: 3/4,\n\nThus -2b = 3/4 \u21d2 b = -3/8.\n\nAgain, that matches the earlier result for log\u2082y = -3/8. Good.\n\nSimilarly, let's add equations 2 and 3:\n\nEquation2 + Equation3:\n\n(-a + b - c) + (-a - b + c) =1/3 +1/4,\n\nLeft side: (-a -a) + (b - b) + (-c + c) = -2a,\n\nRight side: 7/12,\n\nThus -2a =7/12 \u21d2 a = -7/24.\n\nWhich is exactly log\u2082x = -7/24, so that's consistent with previous results. So this method also gives the same a, b, c.\n\nTherefore, now, we can compute 4a +3b +2c.\n\nPlugging in:\n\n4a =4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3b =3*(-3/8) = -9/8 = -36/24,\n\n2c =2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -20/24,\n\nAdding them all together:\n\n-28/24 -36/24 -20/24 = (-28 -36 -20)/24 = (-84)/24? Wait a second, hold on, wait.\n\nWait, hold on, 4a +3b +2c:\n\nWait 4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3*(-3/8) is 3*(-3)/8 = -9/8. To convert to 24 denominator: -9/8 = (-27)/24,\n\nWait, I think I made a mistake here in the previous step. Let me recalculate:\n\nWait 3b: since b is -3/8, so 3*(-3/8) = -9/8. To express over 24, multiply numerator and denominator by 3: -27/24.\n\nSimilarly 2c: c is -5/12, so 2*(-5/12)= -10/12 = -10/12 = -5/6 = but over 24 denominator: -10/12 is equivalent to -20/24.\n\nTherefore, total:\n\n-28/24 (from 4a) + (-27/24 from 3b) + (-20/24 from 2c) = total numerator: -28 -27 -20 = -75. So -75/24, same as before. So absolute value is 75/24 =25/8. So same answer.\n\nSo this method confirms the previous result. Therefore, m + n is 25 +8 =33.\n\nTherefore, I'm confident the answer is 33.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n\n\nGiven the system of equations involving logarithms:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}, \\quad \\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4},\n\\]\n\nwe start by converting these logarithmic equations into their exponential forms:\n\n1. \\( x = 2^{1/2} \\cdot yz \\)\n2. \\( y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz \\)\n3. \\( z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy \\)\n\nNext, we introduce variables \\( a = \\log_2 x \\), \\( b = \\log_2 y \\), and \\( c = \\log_2 z \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given three logarithmic equations with variables x, y, and z. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Hmm, alright. Let me start by writing down the equations again so I can see them clearly.\n\nThe equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, logarithms with base 2. Maybe I can convert these equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle? Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo now I have three equations:\n\nEquation 1: x = (2^(1/2)) * y z\n\nEquation 2: y = (2^(1/3)) * x z\n\nEquation 3: z = (2^(1/4)) * x y\n\nHmm, these are three equations with three variables. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the others and substitute them? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps taking logarithms again? Wait, but they are already in logarithmic form. Alternatively, maybe express each variable in terms of the others and substitute step by step. Let me try substitution.\n\nStarting with equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let's call this equation (1).\n\nEquation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z. Let's call this equation (2).\n\nEquation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y. Equation (3).\n\nHmm. Let's substitute equation (1) into equation (2). Since x is expressed in terms of y and z, perhaps substituting x into equation (2) would let us express y in terms of y and z, but that might complicate. Alternatively, maybe substitute all into each other?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiplying all three equations together? Let me see:\n\nIf I multiply the right-hand sides of equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nLeft-hand sides would be x * y * z.\n\nRight-hand sides: [2^(1/2) * y z] * [2^(1/3) * x z] * [2^(1/4) * x y]\n\nWait, actually, if I take the product of the three equations:\n\nEquation1: x = 2^(1/2) y z\n\nEquation2: y = 2^(1/3) x z\n\nEquation3: z = 2^(1/4) x y\n\nMultiply all left sides: x * y * z\n\nMultiply all right sides: 2^(1/2) * y z * 2^(1/3) * x z * 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side step by step.\n\nFirst, the constants: 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute that exponent:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let's find a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So total is 6+4+3 =13/12. So 2^(13/12).\n\nThen, the variables in the right-hand side: y z * x z * x y = x^2 y^2 z^2.\n\nTherefore, the product of the right-hand sides is 2^(13/12) * x\u00b2 y\u00b2 z\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the product of the left-hand sides (x y z) equals the product of the right-hand sides:\n\nx y z = 2^(13/12) * x\u00b2 y\u00b2 z\u00b2.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nx y z = 2^(13/12) * (x y z)^2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nDivide both sides by (x y z)^2 (assuming x y z \u22600, which they are positive real numbers):\n\n1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)\n\nTherefore, x y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nHmm, that gives me the product x y z. Let me note that down:\n\nEquation (4): x y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nHmm, that's useful. Maybe I can use this to find each variable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express each variable in terms of x y z?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me recall equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nFrom equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Since x y z = 2^(-13/12), then substituting x here gives:\n\n2^(-13/12) = x y z = (2^(1/2) y z) * y z = 2^(1/2) y z * y z = 2^(1/2) (y z)^2\n\nWait, maybe that's a way to find y z?\n\nWait, let me try:\n\nFrom equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z. Then, substituting into equation (4):\n\nx y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nSo replacing x with 2^(1/2) y z:\n\n(2^(1/2) y z) * y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nWhich is 2^(1/2) * y\u00b2 z\u00b2 = 2^(-13/12)\n\nHmm, so:\n\ny\u00b2 z\u00b2 = 2^(-13/12 - 1/2) = 2^(-13/12 - 6/12) = 2^(-19/12)\n\nTherefore, (y z)^2 = 2^(-19/12) => y z = 2^(-19/24). Since y and z are positive, we can take the positive root.\n\nBut from equation (1), x = 2^(1/2) * y z = 2^(1/2) * 2^(-19/24) = 2^(12/24 -19/24) = 2^(-7/24). So x = 2^(-7/24). Okay, so that gives x.\n\nSimilarly, maybe do the same for y and z?\n\nLet me see. Let's try equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z. Let's substitute x z from equation (4):\n\nFrom equation (4): x y z = 2^(-13/12). So x z = 2^(-13/12)/y.\n\nSo substituting into equation (2):\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (2^(-13/12)/y )\n\nMultiply both sides by y:\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-13/12) = 2^(1/3 -13/12) = 2^(4/12 -13/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive.\n\nSimilarly, let's do equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nAgain, from equation (4): x y = 2^(-13/12)/z.\n\nSubstitute into equation (3):\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * (2^(-13/12)/z )\n\nMultiply both sides by z:\n\nz\u00b2 = 2^(1/4) * 2^(-13/12) = 2^(3/12 -13/12) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTherefore, z = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive.\n\nAlright, so now I have expressions for x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-3/8),\n\nz = 2^(-5/12).\n\nHmm, let me check if these satisfy equation (4):\n\nx y z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12). Let me compute exponents:\n\nFirst, convert all exponents to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/24 stays as is.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24,\n\n-5/12 = -10/24.\n\nAdding them up: -7 -9 -10 = -26; over 24. So exponent is -26/24 = -13/12, which matches equation (4). Good, that checks out.\n\nSo now, with x, y, z expressed in terms of powers of 2, I can compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2). Let's see.\n\nFirst, let's compute the exponent inside the log: x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2. Since each variable is 2 to some exponent, multiplying them would add exponents.\n\nLet me write each variable as 2 raised to their respective exponents:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24),\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24).\n\nTherefore, x\u2074 = [2^(-7/24)]\u2074 = 2^(-28/24),\n\ny\u00b3 = [2^(-9/24)]\u00b3 = 2^(-27/24),\n\nz\u00b2 = [2^(-10/24)]\u00b2 = 2^(-20/24).\n\nMultiply all together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-28/24 -27/24 -20/24) = 2^(- (28 +27 +20)/24 )\n\nAdding the numerators: 28+27=55, 55+20=75. So exponent is -75/24.\n\nSimplify that exponent: 75 and 24 have a common divisor of 3: 75 \u00f73=25; 24 \u00f73=8. So -25/8.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nBut the problem asks for the absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nTherefore, the value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1. Therefore, m + n = 33.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculation again step by step to be sure.\n\nFirst, exponents for x\u2074:\n\nx is 2^(-7/24). So x\u2074 exponent is 4*(-7/24) = -28/24.\n\ny\u00b3: y is 2^(-3/8). Let's convert 3/8 to 24 denominator: 3/8 = 9/24, so exponent is -9/24. Then times 3: 3*(-9/24) = -27/24.\n\nz\u00b2: z is 2^(-5/12). 5/12 is 10/24, so exponent is -10/24. Times 2: 2*(-10/24) = -20/24.\n\nTotal exponent: -28 -27 -20 over 24: that is (-28 -27)= -55, then -55 -20 = -75. So -75/24. Simplify: 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So yes, -25/8. So log base 2 is indeed -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So 25 + 8 is 33. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if there was a miscalculation in exponents. Let me check each variable again.\n\nx was found to be 2^(-7/24). Let me check how we got that.\n\nFrom equation (1): x = 2^(1/2)* y z. Then we substituted into equation (4):\n\nx y z = 2^(-13/12). So replacing x with 2^(1/2)* y z gives:\n\n2^(1/2)* y z * y z = 2^(1/2)*(y z)^2 = 2^(-13/12)\n\nSo (y z)^2 = 2^(-13/12 - 1/2). The exponent: -13/12 - 6/12 (since 1/2 is 6/12) = -19/12. So (y z)^2 = 2^(-19/12) => y z = 2^(-19/24). Therefore, x = 2^(1/2)*2^(-19/24) = 2^(12/24 - 19/24) = 2^(-7/24). That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for y: equation (2) led us to y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). Let me check:\n\nFrom equation (2): y = 2^(1/3)*x z. Then substituting x z from equation (4): x z = (x y z)/y = 2^(-13/12)/y. Thus, equation (2) becomes y = 2^(1/3)*(2^(-13/12)/y). Multiply both sides by y: y\u00b2 = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-13/12). Converting to 12 denominator: 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 -13/12 = -9/12 = -3/4. So exponent is -3/4, so y\u00b2=2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). Correct.\n\nSimilarly for z: equation (3) gives z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6). Wait, let me check again:\n\nEquation (3): z = 2^(1/4)*x y. Then, from equation (4): x y = (x y z)/z = 2^(-13/12)/z. So substituting into equation (3):\n\nz = 2^(1/4)*(2^(-13/12)/z). Multiply both sides by z:\n\nz\u00b2 = 2^(1/4)*2^(-13/12). Let's convert exponents to 12 denominator:\n\n1/4 is 3/12, so 3/12 -13/12 = -10/12 = -5/6. So exponent is -5/6, so z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). Correct. So that's all correct.\n\nTherefore, the exponents for x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2:\n\nx\u2074: (-7/24)*4 = -7/6\n\ny\u00b3: (-3/8)*3 = -9/8\n\nz\u00b2: (-5/12)*2 = -5/6\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I should compute it this way as an alternative. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z.\n\nSince log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = log\u2082x\u2074 + log\u2082y\u00b3 + log\u2082z\u00b2 = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z.\n\nMaybe compute each log\u2082x, log\u2082y, log\u2082z first.\n\nWe have:\n\nlog\u2082x = -7/24,\n\nlog\u2082y = -3/8,\n\nlog\u2082z = -5/12.\n\nTherefore,\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3*(-3/8) = -9/8 = -27/24,\n\n2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -10/12 = -10/12 = - (10/12)*(2/2) = -20/24.\n\nAdding them all: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8, same as before. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value is 25/8. So m + n is 25 + 8 = 33. That should be the answer.\n\nBut let me just check once again if I didn't make any miscalculations. It's easy to slip up with fractions.\n\nWait, 25 and 8 are coprime? Yes, since prime factors of 25 are 5s, and 8 is 2s. No common factors. So 25/8 is reduced, so m=25, n=8, sum 33.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication when I did the product of the three equations?\n\nWait let me recheck that step. When I multiplied all three equations:\n\nEquation1: x = 2^(1/2)* y z\n\nEquation2: y = 2^(1/3)*x z\n\nEquation3: z = 2^(1/4)*x y\n\nMultiplying left sides: x*y*z.\n\nMultiplying right sides: [2^(1/2) y z] * [2^(1/3) x z] * [2^(1/4) x y]\n\nMultiply constants: 2^(1/2 +1/3 +1/4). As before, that was 13/12. Correct.\n\nVariables: (y z) * (x z) * (x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2. Correct.\n\nSo x y z = 2^(13/12) * x\u00b2 y\u00b2 z\u00b2. Then rearranged to 1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12). Therefore, x y z = 2^(-13/12). Correct.\n\nYes, that step is correct. So all steps check out. So the final answer is 33. So I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's see. I have this problem where I need to find the value of |log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2)| given three logarithmic equations with variables x, y, and z. The answer should be in the form m/n where m and n are coprime, and then find m + n. Hmm, alright. Let me start by writing down the equations again so I can see them clearly.\n\nThe equations are:\n\n1. log\u2082(x / (y z)) = 1/2\n2. log\u2082(y / (x z)) = 1/3\n3. log\u2082(z / (x y)) = 1/4\n\nHmm, logarithms with base 2. Maybe I can convert these equations into exponential form to make them easier to handle? Let me recall that log_b(a) = c is equivalent to b^c = a. So applying that here:\n\n1. 2^(1/2) = x / (y z)\n2. 2^(1/3) = y / (x z)\n3. 2^(1/4) = z / (x y)\n\nSo now I have three equations:\n\nEquation 1: x = (2^(1/2)) * y z\n\nEquation 2: y = (2^(1/3)) * x z\n\nEquation 3: z = (2^(1/4)) * x y\n\nHmm, these are three equations with three variables. Maybe I can express each variable in terms of the others and substitute them? Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps taking logarithms again? Wait, but they are already in logarithmic form. Alternatively, maybe express each variable in terms of the others and substitute step by step. Let me try substitution.\n\nStarting with equation 1: x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Let's call this equation (1).\n\nEquation 2: y = 2^(1/3) * x z. Let's call this equation (2).\n\nEquation 3: z = 2^(1/4) * x y. Equation (3).\n\nHmm. Let's substitute equation (1) into equation (2). Since x is expressed in terms of y and z, perhaps substituting x into equation (2) would let us express y in terms of y and z, but that might complicate. Alternatively, maybe substitute all into each other?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps multiplying all three equations together? Let me see:\n\nIf I multiply the right-hand sides of equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nLeft-hand sides would be x * y * z.\n\nRight-hand sides: [2^(1/2) * y z] * [2^(1/3) * x z] * [2^(1/4) * x y]\n\nWait, actually, if I take the product of the three equations:\n\nEquation1: x = 2^(1/2) y z\n\nEquation2: y = 2^(1/3) x z\n\nEquation3: z = 2^(1/4) x y\n\nMultiply all left sides: x * y * z\n\nMultiply all right sides: 2^(1/2) * y z * 2^(1/3) * x z * 2^(1/4) * x y\n\nLet me compute the right-hand side step by step.\n\nFirst, the constants: 2^(1/2) * 2^(1/3) * 2^(1/4) = 2^(1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4). Let me compute that exponent:\n\n1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4. Let's find a common denominator, which is 12.\n\n1/2 = 6/12, 1/3 = 4/12, 1/4 = 3/12. So total is 6+4+3 =13/12. So 2^(13/12).\n\nThen, the variables in the right-hand side: y z * x z * x y = x^2 y^2 z^2.\n\nTherefore, the product of the right-hand sides is 2^(13/12) * x\u00b2 y\u00b2 z\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, the product of the left-hand sides (x y z) equals the product of the right-hand sides:\n\nx y z = 2^(13/12) * x\u00b2 y\u00b2 z\u00b2.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nx y z = 2^(13/12) * (x y z)^2\n\nLet me rearrange this equation:\n\nDivide both sides by (x y z)^2 (assuming x y z \u22600, which they are positive real numbers):\n\n1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12)\n\nTherefore, x y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nHmm, that gives me the product x y z. Let me note that down:\n\nEquation (4): x y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nHmm, that's useful. Maybe I can use this to find each variable?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express each variable in terms of x y z?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me recall equations (1), (2), (3):\n\nFrom equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) * y z. Since x y z = 2^(-13/12), then substituting x here gives:\n\n2^(-13/12) = x y z = (2^(1/2) y z) * y z = 2^(1/2) y z * y z = 2^(1/2) (y z)^2\n\nWait, maybe that's a way to find y z?\n\nWait, let me try:\n\nFrom equation (1): x = 2^(1/2) y z. Then, substituting into equation (4):\n\nx y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nSo replacing x with 2^(1/2) y z:\n\n(2^(1/2) y z) * y z = 2^(-13/12)\n\nWhich is 2^(1/2) * y\u00b2 z\u00b2 = 2^(-13/12)\n\nHmm, so:\n\ny\u00b2 z\u00b2 = 2^(-13/12 - 1/2) = 2^(-13/12 - 6/12) = 2^(-19/12)\n\nTherefore, (y z)^2 = 2^(-19/12) => y z = 2^(-19/24). Since y and z are positive, we can take the positive root.\n\nBut from equation (1), x = 2^(1/2) * y z = 2^(1/2) * 2^(-19/24) = 2^(12/24 -19/24) = 2^(-7/24). So x = 2^(-7/24). Okay, so that gives x.\n\nSimilarly, maybe do the same for y and z?\n\nLet me see. Let's try equation (2): y = 2^(1/3) x z. Let's substitute x z from equation (4):\n\nFrom equation (4): x y z = 2^(-13/12). So x z = 2^(-13/12)/y.\n\nSo substituting into equation (2):\n\ny = 2^(1/3) * (2^(-13/12)/y )\n\nMultiply both sides by y:\n\ny\u00b2 = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-13/12) = 2^(1/3 -13/12) = 2^(4/12 -13/12) = 2^(-9/12) = 2^(-3/4)\n\nTherefore, y = 2^(-3/8). Since y is positive.\n\nSimilarly, let's do equation (3): z = 2^(1/4) x y.\n\nAgain, from equation (4): x y = 2^(-13/12)/z.\n\nSubstitute into equation (3):\n\nz = 2^(1/4) * (2^(-13/12)/z )\n\nMultiply both sides by z:\n\nz\u00b2 = 2^(1/4) * 2^(-13/12) = 2^(3/12 -13/12) = 2^(-10/12) = 2^(-5/6)\n\nTherefore, z = 2^(-5/12). Since z is positive.\n\nAlright, so now I have expressions for x, y, z:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-3/8),\n\nz = 2^(-5/12).\n\nHmm, let me check if these satisfy equation (4):\n\nx y z = 2^(-7/24) * 2^(-3/8) * 2^(-5/12). Let me compute exponents:\n\nFirst, convert all exponents to 24 denominators:\n\n-7/24 stays as is.\n\n-3/8 = -9/24,\n\n-5/12 = -10/24.\n\nAdding them up: -7 -9 -10 = -26; over 24. So exponent is -26/24 = -13/12, which matches equation (4). Good, that checks out.\n\nSo now, with x, y, z expressed in terms of powers of 2, I can compute log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2). Let's see.\n\nFirst, let's compute the exponent inside the log: x\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2. Since each variable is 2 to some exponent, multiplying them would add exponents.\n\nLet me write each variable as 2 raised to their respective exponents:\n\nx = 2^(-7/24),\n\ny = 2^(-3/8) = 2^(-9/24),\n\nz = 2^(-5/12) = 2^(-10/24).\n\nTherefore, x\u2074 = [2^(-7/24)]\u2074 = 2^(-28/24),\n\ny\u00b3 = [2^(-9/24)]\u00b3 = 2^(-27/24),\n\nz\u00b2 = [2^(-10/24)]\u00b2 = 2^(-20/24).\n\nMultiply all together:\n\nx\u2074 y\u00b3 z\u00b2 = 2^(-28/24 -27/24 -20/24) = 2^(- (28 +27 +20)/24 )\n\nAdding the numerators: 28+27=55, 55+20=75. So exponent is -75/24.\n\nSimplify that exponent: 75 and 24 have a common divisor of 3: 75 \u00f73=25; 24 \u00f73=8. So -25/8.\n\nTherefore, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = log\u2082(2^(-25/8)) = -25/8.\n\nBut the problem asks for the absolute value: | -25/8 | = 25/8.\n\nTherefore, the value is 25/8, so m=25, n=8. They are coprime since 25 and 8 share no common divisors except 1. Therefore, m + n = 33.\n\nWait, let me verify the calculation again step by step to be sure.\n\nFirst, exponents for x\u2074:\n\nx is 2^(-7/24). So x\u2074 exponent is 4*(-7/24) = -28/24.\n\ny\u00b3: y is 2^(-3/8). Let's convert 3/8 to 24 denominator: 3/8 = 9/24, so exponent is -9/24. Then times 3: 3*(-9/24) = -27/24.\n\nz\u00b2: z is 2^(-5/12). 5/12 is 10/24, so exponent is -10/24. Times 2: 2*(-10/24) = -20/24.\n\nTotal exponent: -28 -27 -20 over 24: that is (-28 -27)= -55, then -55 -20 = -75. So -75/24. Simplify: 75 divided by 3 is 25, 24 divided by 3 is 8. So yes, -25/8. So log base 2 is indeed -25/8, absolute value is 25/8. So 25 + 8 is 33. That seems right.\n\nWait, but let me check if there was a miscalculation in exponents. Let me check each variable again.\n\nx was found to be 2^(-7/24). Let me check how we got that.\n\nFrom equation (1): x = 2^(1/2)* y z. Then we substituted into equation (4):\n\nx y z = 2^(-13/12). So replacing x with 2^(1/2)* y z gives:\n\n2^(1/2)* y z * y z = 2^(1/2)*(y z)^2 = 2^(-13/12)\n\nSo (y z)^2 = 2^(-13/12 - 1/2). The exponent: -13/12 - 6/12 (since 1/2 is 6/12) = -19/12. So (y z)^2 = 2^(-19/12) => y z = 2^(-19/24). Therefore, x = 2^(1/2)*2^(-19/24) = 2^(12/24 - 19/24) = 2^(-7/24). That's correct.\n\nSimilarly, for y: equation (2) led us to y\u00b2 = 2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). Let me check:\n\nFrom equation (2): y = 2^(1/3)*x z. Then substituting x z from equation (4): x z = (x y z)/y = 2^(-13/12)/y. Thus, equation (2) becomes y = 2^(1/3)*(2^(-13/12)/y). Multiply both sides by y: y\u00b2 = 2^(1/3) * 2^(-13/12). Converting to 12 denominator: 1/3 is 4/12, so 4/12 -13/12 = -9/12 = -3/4. So exponent is -3/4, so y\u00b2=2^(-3/4), so y = 2^(-3/8). Correct.\n\nSimilarly for z: equation (3) gives z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6). Wait, let me check again:\n\nEquation (3): z = 2^(1/4)*x y. Then, from equation (4): x y = (x y z)/z = 2^(-13/12)/z. So substituting into equation (3):\n\nz = 2^(1/4)*(2^(-13/12)/z). Multiply both sides by z:\n\nz\u00b2 = 2^(1/4)*2^(-13/12). Let's convert exponents to 12 denominator:\n\n1/4 is 3/12, so 3/12 -13/12 = -10/12 = -5/6. So exponent is -5/6, so z\u00b2 = 2^(-5/6), so z = 2^(-5/12). Correct. So that's all correct.\n\nTherefore, the exponents for x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2:\n\nx\u2074: (-7/24)*4 = -7/6\n\ny\u00b3: (-3/8)*3 = -9/8\n\nz\u00b2: (-5/12)*2 = -5/6\n\nWait, hold on, maybe I should compute it this way as an alternative. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z.\n\nSince log\u2082(x\u2074y\u00b3z\u00b2) = log\u2082x\u2074 + log\u2082y\u00b3 + log\u2082z\u00b2 = 4 log\u2082x + 3 log\u2082y + 2 log\u2082z.\n\nMaybe compute each log\u2082x, log\u2082y, log\u2082z first.\n\nWe have:\n\nlog\u2082x = -7/24,\n\nlog\u2082y = -3/8,\n\nlog\u2082z = -5/12.\n\nTherefore,\n\n4*(-7/24) + 3*(-3/8) + 2*(-5/12).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n4*(-7/24) = -28/24,\n\n3*(-3/8) = -9/8 = -27/24,\n\n2*(-5/12) = -10/12 = -10/12 = -10/12 = - (10/12)*(2/2) = -20/24.\n\nAdding them all: (-28 -27 -20)/24 = (-75)/24 = -25/8, same as before. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value is 25/8. So m + n is 25 + 8 = 33. That should be the answer.\n\nBut let me just check once again if I didn't make any miscalculations. It's easy to slip up with fractions.\n\nWait, 25 and 8 are coprime? Yes, since prime factors of 25 are 5s, and 8 is 2s. No common factors. So 25/8 is reduced, so m=25, n=8, sum 33.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication when I did the product of the three equations?\n\nWait let me recheck that step. When I multiplied all three equations:\n\nEquation1: x = 2^(1/2)* y z\n\nEquation2: y = 2^(1/3)*x z\n\nEquation3: z = 2^(1/4)*x y\n\nMultiplying left sides: x*y*z.\n\nMultiplying right sides: [2^(1/2) y z] * [2^(1/3) x z] * [2^(1/4) x y]\n\nMultiply constants: 2^(1/2 +1/3 +1/4). As before, that was 13/12. Correct.\n\nVariables: (y z) * (x z) * (x y) = x^2 y^2 z^2. Correct.\n\nSo x y z = 2^(13/12) * x\u00b2 y\u00b2 z\u00b2. Then rearranged to 1/(x y z) = 2^(13/12). Therefore, x y z = 2^(-13/12). Correct.\n\nYes, that step is correct. So all steps check out. So the final answer is 33. So I think that's solid.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{33}\n\n\nGiven the system of equations involving logarithms:\n\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{x}{yz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{y}{xz}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_2\\left(\\frac{z}{xy}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4}\n\\]\n\nWe convert these logarithmic equations to their exponential forms:\n\n1. \\( x = 2^{1/2} \\cdot yz \\)\n2. \\( y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz \\)\n3. \\( z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy \\)\n\nMultiplying all three equations together, we get:\n\n\\[\nx \\cdot y \\cdot z = 2^{1/2} \\cdot yz \\cdot 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz \\cdot 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side, we combine the constants and variables:\n\n\\[\nxyz = 2^{1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4} \\cdot (xyz)^2\n\\]\n\nCalculating the exponent of 2:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{6}{12} + \\frac{4}{12} + \\frac{3}{12} = \\frac{13}{12}\n\\]\n\nThus, we have:\n\n\\[\nxyz = 2^{13/12} \\cdot (xyz)^2 \\implies \\frac{1}{xyz} = 2^{13/12} \\implies xyz = 2^{-13/12}\n\\]\n\nNext, we express each variable in terms of the product \\(xyz\\):\n\n- From \\(x = 2^{1/2} \\cdot yz\\), substituting \\(xyz = 2^{-13/12}\\) gives \\(x = 2^{-7/24}\\).\n- From \\(y = 2^{1/3} \\cdot xz\\), substituting \\(xyz = 2^{-13/12}\\) gives \\(y = 2^{-3/8}\\).\n- From \\(z = 2^{1/4} \\cdot xy\\), substituting \\(xyz = 2^{-13/12}\\) gives \\(z = 2^{-5/12}\\).\n\nWe then compute \\(\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\log_2(x^4 y^3 z^2) = 4 \\log_2 x + 3 \\log_2 y + 2 \\log_2 z\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the exponents:\n\n\\[\n4 \\left(-\\frac{7}{24}\\right) + 3 \\left(-\\frac{3}{8}\\right) + 2 \\left(-\\frac{5}{12}\\right)\n\\]\n\nConverting to a common denominator (24):\n\n\\[\n4 \\left(-\\frac{7}{24}\\right) = -\\frac{28}{24}, \\quad 3 \\left(-\\frac{9}{24}\\right) = -\\frac{27}{24}, \\quad 2 \\left(-\\frac{10}{24}\\right) = -\\frac{20}{24}\n\\]\n\nSumming these:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{28 + 27 + 20}{24} = -\\frac{75}{24} = -\\frac{25}{8}\n\\]\n\nTaking the absolute value:\n\n\\[\n\\left| -\\frac{25}{8} \\right| = \\frac{25}{8}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(m = 25\\) and \\(n = 8\\), giving \\(m + n = 25 + 8 = 33\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{33}\n\\]",
