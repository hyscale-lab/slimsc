      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. There's a unique point C on segment AB, not A or B, that isn't on any segment from F except AB itself. We need to find OC squared, express it as p/q with p and q coprime, then find p + q.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to understand what the family F is. Each segment in F is a unit length segment from a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis in the first quadrant. So, for any such segment PQ, P has coordinates (p, 0) and Q has coordinates (0, q), with the distance between them being 1. The distance formula gives sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So all such segments lie on the unit circle but with endpoints on the axes.\n\nWait, but since they are in the first quadrant, p and q are non-negative. So all these segments are parts of lines from (p,0) to (0,q) where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. \n\nThe problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that is not on any of these segments except AB. So, point C is on AB, and the only segment from F that passes through C is AB itself. So, if I can find such a point C, then compute OC squared.\n\nFirst, let me parametrize segment AB. Let me find the coordinates of points on AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the segment AB can be parametrized as:\n\nLet\u2019s use a parameter t where t goes from 0 to 1. When t=0, we are at A, and t=1 at B. So coordinates would be:\n\nx = (1/2)(1 - t)\n\ny = (sqrt(3)/2) t\n\nSo any point C on AB can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1. Since we need the point distinct from A and B, t is between 0 and 1 but not 0 or 1.\n\nNow, the key is that this point C is not on any segment from F except AB. That means, for any other segment PQ in F (other than AB itself), C is not on PQ. So, if we can find a point C on AB such that whenever C is on some PQ in F, then that PQ must be AB. So, we need to find such a point C where the only PQ in F containing it is AB.\n\nAlternatively, if we can show that for point C, any line through C with endpoints on the axes at distance 1 must be AB. So, perhaps C is such that the only such line through it is AB. Therefore, perhaps C is the point where all other possible lines PQ (from F) would not pass through it, except AB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a point where the only unit-length segment from the x-axis to y-axis passing through it is AB. So, if I can find such a point, then that's our C.\n\nTo approach this, perhaps we can consider the set of all lines PQ in F. Each such line can be represented by an equation, and the point C must lie only on the line AB among all these lines. So, the problem reduces to finding a point C on AB such that it does not lie on any other line from F except AB.\n\nAlternatively, for point C, if we suppose that it lies on another segment PQ in F, then that PQ must coincide with AB. So, we need to ensure that if there exists another PQ through C, then PQ is AB.\n\nTo find such a point C, perhaps we can set up equations and find the point where only AB passes through it among all the possible PQ lines.\n\nLet me think. Let\u2019s suppose that point C is (x, y). Since it's on AB, we can express y in terms of x. Let me first find the equation of AB. Since A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Therefore, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). So, for any point C on AB, its coordinates satisfy y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, suppose that C lies on some segment PQ in F. Then PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, and the point (x,y) lies on the line PQ. Let me write the equation of line PQ.\n\nThe line PQ goes from (p,0) to (0,q). The equation can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1. Because in intercept form, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSo, if point C (x,y) is on this line, then x/p + y/q = 1. Also, since PQ has length 1, we have p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nTherefore, for point C to lie on such a line PQ (other than AB itself), there must exist some p and q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and x/p + y/q =1. But since we want C to not lie on any such line except AB, the only solution (p,q) to these equations must be the one corresponding to AB.\n\nTherefore, we need that the system of equations:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nhas only one solution (p,q) corresponding to the segment AB.\n\nTherefore, to find point C, we need to find (x,y) on AB such that the above system has only one solution (p,q) on the unit circle in the first quadrant, which is the one corresponding to AB. So, we need to set up this condition.\n\nAlternatively, since the system must have only one solution, the equations must be such that when we solve them, there is only one (p,q). Let me try to set this up.\n\nGiven that (x,y) is on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let me denote that as equation (1). Let me also note that for point C (x,y) on AB, the equations x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 must have only the solution (p,q) corresponding to AB. Let me find the coordinates of AB's endpoints: A is (1/2,0), so that would correspond to p =1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2? Wait, hold on. Wait, AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So the segment AB itself is part of the family F?\n\nWait, let me check if AB is indeed in family F. The length of AB: distance between A(1/2,0) and B(0,sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt( 1/4 + 3/4 ) = sqrt(1) =1. So yes, AB is a member of F. So the problem says that point C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, C is not on any other segment of F except AB. Therefore, the system above must have only the solution (p,q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nTherefore, for the point C(x,y), the equations x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 must have only the solution (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, to ensure that, we need that when we solve the system, the only solution is p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nTherefore, substituting y from equation (1) into the first equation:\n\nx/p + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1.\n\nSo, that's one equation, and the other is p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Let me denote variables p and q here, with p and q positive (since they are intercepts in first quadrant).\n\nSo, perhaps to make the system have only one solution, the equations must be tangent in some sense? Maybe the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1? Wait, no, because p and q are variables here. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we treat p and q as variables, and for the given x and y (on AB), we can think of the equation x/p + y/q =1 as a linear equation in variables 1/p and 1/q? Not sure. Alternatively, we can write this as:\n\nLet me rearrange the equation x/p + y/q =1. Let me denote u = 1/p and v =1/q, so the equation becomes x u + y v =1. But p and q must satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that for given x and y, the equation x/p + y/q =1 must have only one solution (p, q) on the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1. To find such (x,y), so that the system has only one solution. So, in other words, the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1? Wait, but here p and q are variables. Wait, actually, in this case, if we consider p and q as variables, then the equation x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, so the intersection points between the line and the circle must be only one point, so the line is tangent to the circle.\n\nTherefore, the condition is that the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Therefore, the system has exactly one solution (p, q). So, to have this tangency condition, the distance from the origin to the line x/p + y/q =1 must be equal to the radius, which is 1? Wait, but the line is in terms of p and q? Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of p and q as coordinates.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I need to switch variables here. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we consider p and q as coordinates in the plane, then the unit circle is p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, and the line x/p + y/q =1 must be tangent to this circle. Therefore, for the line x/p + y/q =1 to be tangent to the circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, the condition for tangency is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to the radius (1). Wait, but the line is in terms of p and q? Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the line x/p + y/q =1 can be rewritten as q x + p y = p q. But since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers or some substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me parametrize p and q on the unit circle. Let me set p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, and since p and q are positive (as intercepts on positive axes), \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation x/p + y/q =1, we get:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, for point C(x,y), this equation must have only one solution \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2). Therefore, the equation x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1 must have only one solution \u03b8 for the given x and y on AB.\n\nTherefore, we need that this equation has exactly one solution \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2). So, the function f(\u03b8) = x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 -1 must have exactly one root in that interval.\n\nTo have exactly one solution, the function f(\u03b8) must cross zero exactly once. To ensure that, perhaps the function is monotonic? Or maybe it has a minimum that touches zero? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since we want only one \u03b8 where this holds, perhaps the minimum of f(\u03b8) is zero, or something like that. Hmm, perhaps calculus can help here. Let me consider f(\u03b8) = x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 -1. To find its critical points, take derivative with respect to \u03b8 and set to zero.\n\nBut before that, since x and y are related via the AB line, let me substitute y from AB into this equation. Since y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, so let's substitute that.\n\nSo f(\u03b8) = x / cos\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sin\u03b8 -1 = 0.\n\nLet me denote x as variable, since the point C is (x,y) on AB, so x can be between 0 and 1/2 (since A is at 1/2, and moving towards B at (0, sqrt(3)/2)). So x is between 0 and 1/2, and y correspondingly from sqrt(3)/2 down to 0.\n\nSo, let's write f(\u03b8) in terms of x and \u03b8:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sin\u03b8 -1 =0.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3)/2:\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx [1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8] + sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8) -1 =0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe set up the equation and find when it has only one solution \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the equation x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1 must have exactly one solution \u03b8. Let me write y in terms of x as y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So substituting:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3)/2:\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me denote sqrt(3) as s for simplicity. Then,\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + [ -s x + s/2 ] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx (1/cos\u03b8 - s / sin\u03b8) + (s)/(2 sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps group terms differently. Alternatively, let me combine terms over a common denominator. Let me see:\n\nMultiply both sides by sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx sin\u03b8 + [ -s x + s/2 ] cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nx sin\u03b8 - s x cos\u03b8 + (s/2) cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nx sin\u03b8 - s x cos\u03b8 + (s/2) cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe we can collect like terms.\n\nLet me group terms with sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) + cos\u03b8 (-s x + s/2 - sin\u03b8) =0.\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe rearrange terms:\n\nx sin\u03b8 - s x cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - (s/2) cos\u03b8\n\nFactor x on the left:\n\nx (sin\u03b8 - s cos\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - s/2 )\n\nHmm, so:\n\nx = [ cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - s/2 ) ] / ( sin\u03b8 - s cos\u03b8 )\n\nBut s is sqrt(3). Let me substitute back s = sqrt(3):\n\nx = [ cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2 ) ) ] / ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 )\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be simplified. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nDenominator: sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8\n\nHmm, note that the denominator is sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8. Let me see if the numerator can be written in terms of the denominator. Let me compute:\n\nLet me see:\n\nsin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 = ?\n\nNot directly. Alternatively, let me factor something out. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, let me write the numerator:\n\ncos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8\n\nDenominator: sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8\n\nHmm, perhaps factor sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 from numerator? Let me see:\n\nNumerator: cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8) = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8\n\nHmm, maybe we can factor cos\u03b8:\n\ncos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nDenominator: sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8\n\nSo, x = [ cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 )\n\nHmm, maybe we can manipulate this expression further. Let me see:\n\nLet me write the denominator as sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8. Let me note that sqrt(3) is tan(60\u00b0), so perhaps express this in terms of tangent?\n\nLet me set phi such that tan phi = sqrt(3), so phi = 60\u00b0, so perhaps using angle addition formulas. Alternatively, let me consider writing denominator as sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0). Wait, let me check:\n\nUsing the identity: a sin\u03b8 + b cos\u03b8 = C sin(\u03b8 + phi). Wait, actually:\n\nLet me recall that A sin\u03b8 + B cos\u03b8 = C sin(theta + phi). Let me compute for the denominator:\n\nsin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8. Let me write this as:\n\n= 1*sin\u03b8 + (-sqrt(3)) cos\u03b8\n\nThe amplitude is sqrt(1 + (sqrt(3))\u00b2) = sqrt(1 +3)=2.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0), since:\n\nsin(theta - 60\u00b0) = sin theta cos60\u00b0 - cos theta sin60\u00b0 = (1/2) sin theta - (sqrt(3)/2) cos theta.\n\nTherefore, 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0) = sin theta - sqrt(3) cos theta. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, denominator is 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0).\n\nSimilarly, the numerator:\n\ncos theta ( sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nHmm, perhaps also express sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 in terms of some angle? Not sure, but maybe proceed.\n\nTherefore, x = [ cos theta ( sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps simplifying numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me note that sin(theta) - sqrt(3)/2 is a linear term, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express sin(theta) as something. Alternatively, maybe plug in specific angles where this equation holds?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of this as an equation in theta, and we want this to have only one solution theta in (0, pi/2). Therefore, for a given x, the equation x = [ ... ] must have only one solution theta. So, perhaps the function f(theta) = [ cos theta ( sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0) ] must be such that it takes the value x exactly once.\n\nTo have only one solution, this function must be monotonic, or have a extremum that touches x exactly once. To find such x where this occurs, we can look for critical points where the function has a horizontal tangent, i.e., derivative zero. That would correspond to the point where the function has a minimum or maximum, so that x is at that extremum, hence only one solution.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the point C corresponds to the extremum of this function f(theta). Let me try to compute the derivative of f(theta) with respect to theta and set it to zero.\n\nFirst, let me denote f(theta) as:\n\nf(theta) = [ cos theta ( sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0) ]\n\nLet me compute f'(theta). This might be complicated, but let me proceed step by step.\n\nLet me denote numerator N(theta) = cos theta ( sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nDenominator D(theta) = 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0)\n\nTherefore, f(theta) = N(theta)/D(theta)\n\nThen, f\u2019(theta) = [N\u2019(theta) D(theta) - N(theta) D\u2019(theta)] / [D(theta)]\u00b2\n\nFirst compute N\u2019(theta):\n\nN(theta) = cos theta ( sin theta - c ), where c = sqrt(3)/2\n\nN\u2019(theta) = -sin theta ( sin theta - c ) + cos theta ( cos theta )\n\n= -sin\u00b2 theta + c sin theta + cos\u00b2 theta\n\n= (cos\u00b2 theta - sin\u00b2 theta) + c sin theta\n\n= cos(2 theta) + c sin theta\n\nWait, cos\u00b2 - sin\u00b2 is cos(2 theta). So, that's correct.\n\nThen, D(theta) = 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0), so D\u2019(theta) = 2 cos(theta - 60\u00b0)\n\nTherefore, putting into f\u2019(theta):\n\nf\u2019(theta) = [ (cos(2 theta) + c sin theta ) * 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0) - cos theta ( sin theta - c ) * 2 cos(theta - 60\u00b0) ] / [4 sin\u00b2(theta - 60\u00b0)]\n\nThis is quite complex. Let me see if I can simplify numerator step by step.\n\nLet me factor out the 2 in numerator:\n\nNumerator:\n\n2 [ (cos(2 theta) + c sin theta ) sin(theta - 60\u00b0) - cos theta ( sin theta - c ) cos(theta - 60\u00b0) ]\n\nLet me denote c = sqrt(3)/2 for simplicity.\n\nLet me expand term by term:\n\nFirst term: (cos2\u03b8 + c sin\u03b8) sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nSecond term: - cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - c) cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nLet me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst term:\n\ncos2\u03b8 * sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + c sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nSecond term:\n\n- cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + c cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nHmm, combining all terms:\n\nTotal numerator inside the brackets:\n\ncos2\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + c sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + c cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nHmm, let me see if terms can be combined.\n\nFirst and fourth terms have c:\n\nc [ sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) ]\n\nThe expression inside the brackets is cos( (\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) - \u03b8 ) = cos(-60\u00b0) = cos60\u00b0 = 0.5. Wait, because cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. Wait, actually, cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So here, sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) = cos(\u03b8 - (\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)) = cos(60\u00b0) = 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the first and fourth terms together give c * 0.5.\n\nThe remaining terms are:\n\ncos2\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nLet me look at these terms.\n\nLet me note that cos2\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8, but not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor terms:\n\nTake the second remaining term: -cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0). Let me see if this can be combined with the first remaining term.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider cos2\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0):\n\nExpress cos2\u03b8 as sin(\u03c0/2 - 2\u03b8), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use product-to-sum formulas.\n\nLet me recall that sin A cos B = [ sin(A+B) + sin(A-B) ] / 2\n\nSimilarly, cos A sin B = [ sin(A+B) - sin(A-B) ] / 2\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst term: cos2\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) = [ sin( (2\u03b8) + (\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) ) - sin( (2\u03b8) - (\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) ) ] / 2\n\nWait, using the identity sin B cos A = [ sin(A+B) + sin(B - A) ] / 2. Wait, actually, cos2\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) = sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) cos2\u03b8.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nsin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) cos2\u03b8 = [ sin( (\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + 2\u03b8 ) + sin( (\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - 2\u03b8 ) ] /2\n\n= [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(-\u03b8 -60\u00b0) ] /2\n\n= [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2\n\nSimilarly, the second term:\n\n- cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 -60\u00b0) = - [ (sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) cos(\u03b8 -60\u00b0) ]\n\nHmm, let me see:\n\nsin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 = (1/2) sin2\u03b8, so:\n\n- (1/2) sin2\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 -60\u00b0)\n\nThen, using product-to-sum:\n\nsin2\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 -60\u00b0) = [ sin(2\u03b8 + \u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(2\u03b8 - (\u03b8 -60\u00b0) ) ] /2\n\n= [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2\n\nTherefore,\n\n- (1/2) * [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2 = - [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nPutting together the first and second remaining terms:\n\nFirst term's expansion: [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2\n\nSecond term's expansion: - [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nSo total:\n\n[ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2 - [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nLet me combine these fractions over 4:\n\n= 2[ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] - [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] all over 4\n\n= [2 sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - 2 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) - sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\n= [ (2 sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0)) + (-2 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ) ] /4\n\n= [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nSo combining everything, the entire numerator inside the brackets becomes:\n\nc*(0.5) + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nRecall that c = sqrt(3)/2, so:\n\n= (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\n= sqrt(3)/4 + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nTherefore, the entire numerator of f\u2019(theta) is 2 times this:\n\nNumerator_total = 2 [ sqrt(3)/4 + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4 ]\n\n= sqrt(3)/2 + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2\n\nThus,\n\nf\u2019(theta) = [ sqrt(3)/2 + ( sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ) /2 ] / [4 sin\u00b2(theta -60\u00b0) ]\n\nHmm, this is still quite complicated, but perhaps setting numerator equal to zero for critical points.\n\nSet numerator_total =0:\n\nsqrt(3)/2 + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2 =0\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(3) + sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) =0\n\nTherefore:\n\nsin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) = -sqrt(3)\n\nHmm, solving this equation for theta. This seems quite involved. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of going through calculus, we can think geometrically. The point C must lie on AB and such that any other segment from F passing through C must coincide with AB. So, C is the point where the only unit segment from x-axis to y-axis through it is AB. So, perhaps C is the point where the two segments from F are tangent to AB? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, C is such that it's the \"closest\" point on AB to the unit circle in some sense? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of all possible segments PQ in F as lines from (p,0) to (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. The envelope of these lines might form a curve, and point C is where this envelope touches AB. So, perhaps the envelope of the lines PQ in F is a curve, and C is the intersection point of the envelope with AB.\n\nCalculating the envelope of a family of lines can be done using calculus. Let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves satisfies both the equation of the curve and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero.\n\nLet me parametrize the family of lines. Let me use parameter \u03b8 as before, where p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Then the line equation is x/p + y/q =1, so substituting p and q:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we take the derivative with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero.\n\nLet me denote the equation as F(x,y,\u03b8)= x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 -1 =0.\n\nThe envelope condition is:\n\nF(x,y,\u03b8)=0,\n\ndF/d\u03b8 =0.\n\nCompute dF/d\u03b8:\n\nd/d\u03b8 [x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 -1] = x (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 + y (-cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nTherefore:\n\nx (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo, the envelope conditions are:\n\n1. x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\n2. x (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nWe can solve these equations for x and y in terms of \u03b8, then eliminate \u03b8 to find the envelope curve.\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for y:\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nso,\n\ny = x (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 * sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 = x sin\u00b3\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, y = x (tan\u03b8)^3.\n\nLet me denote t = tan\u03b8. Since \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, t is positive.\n\nThen, y = x t^3.\n\nNow, substitute this into equation 1:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nExpress cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 in terms of t:\n\ncos\u03b8 =1/ sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore,\n\nx * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) + y * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)/t =1.\n\nBut y =x t^3, so substitute that:\n\nx sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) + (x t^3) * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)/t =1\n\nSimplify:\n\nx sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) + x t^2 sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) =1\n\nFactor:\n\nx sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) (1 + t\u00b2) =1\n\nTherefore,\n\nx (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2) =1,\n\nso,\n\nx = 1/( (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2) )\n\nBut since y =x t^3,\n\ny = t^3 / (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nThus, the envelope is parametrized by t as:\n\nx = 1/(1 + t\u00b2)^{3/2},\n\ny = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2)^{3/2}\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\nx = (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2},\n\ny = t^3 (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2}\n\nLet me see if we can write this in Cartesian coordinates. Let me set t = y/x^{1/3}, since y = t^3 x. Hmm, maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, note that (x)^{2/3} + (y)^{2/3} = [ (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2} ]^{2/3} + [ t^3 (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2} ]^{2/3}\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nLet me compute x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}:\n\n= [ (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2} ]^{2/3} + [ t^3 (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2} ]^{2/3}\n\n= (1 + t\u00b2)^{-1} + t^2 (1 + t\u00b2)^{-1}\n\n= [1 + t\u00b2]/(1 + t\u00b2) ) =1\n\nTherefore, x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1. Ah! So the envelope of these lines is the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.\n\nWow, that's a nice result. So the envelope is an astroid. Therefore, the family of lines PQ in F form an astroid as their envelope. Therefore, the envelope is the astroid curve x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.\n\nTherefore, the point C must lie on AB and also on the astroid, because the astroid is the envelope, so any point on the astroid lies on exactly one such line PQ (the tangent line). Wait, actually, points on the envelope lie on exactly one member of the family, which is the tangent line at that point. So, the envelope points are exactly the points that lie on only one segment from F. Since the problem states that C is on AB and not on any segment from F except AB, so C must be the intersection point of AB and the astroid, other than A and B.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the intersection of AB with the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1, other than points A and B.\n\nWait, but let's check points A and B:\n\nPoint A is (1/2,0). Plugging into the astroid equation:\n\n( (1/2)^{2/3} ) + 0 = (1/2)^{2/3} \u2248 0.63 <1, so it's inside the astroid. Hmm, but the astroid equation is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1. Wait, the astroid is actually the boundary of the set of points reachable by segments of length 1 from the axes? Wait, but the envelope is the astroid, so points on the astroid are points where only one such segment passes through them, and inside the astroid, there are multiple segments passing through them, and outside none? Hmm, actually, the envelope is the boundary where each point has exactly one tangent line from the family. So, points inside the astroid can be reached by multiple segments, and outside cannot be reached at all.\n\nTherefore, the problem states that point C is on AB and not on any segment from F except AB, so it must lie on the astroid. Because otherwise, if it's inside the astroid, it would lie on multiple segments, and if it's outside, it wouldn't lie on any. Therefore, the only points on AB that are on the astroid are the intersections. Since A and B are on the astroid? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me plug into the astroid equation:\n\n0 + (sqrt(3)/2)^{2/3} = ( (3^{1/2}/2) )^{2/3 } = (3^{1}/2^{2})^{1/3} = (3/4)^{1/3} \u2248 0.908 <1. So, actually, point B is also inside the astroid. Wait, then where are the intersection points?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recast:\n\nWait the astroid equation is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1. Let me plug in point A (1/2,0):\n\n( (1/2)^{2/3} ) +0 \u2248 (0.63) which is less than 1, so inside.\n\nSimilarly, point B (0, sqrt(3)/2):\n\n( sqrt(3)/2 )^{2/3} = ( (3)^{1/2}/2 )^{2/3} = (3^{1}/2^2)^{1/3} = (3/4)^{1/3} \u2248 0.908 <1, so inside as well.\n\nHmm, so then the segment AB is entirely inside the astroid? Then, how does the problem state that C is on AB and not on any segment from F except AB? Because if the entire AB is inside the astroid, then points on AB would lie on multiple segments from F. But the problem says there is a unique such point C. Maybe my envelope reasoning is off?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the envelope calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nThe envelope of the lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nWait, actually, the envelope of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 is indeed the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1. Let me confirm with a standard example. The standard astroid is the envelope of segments of length 1 moving with endpoints on the axes. Wait, actually, yes, that's exactly the case here. So the envelope should be the astroid. So points on the astroid have exactly one such segment passing through them, tangent to the astroid. Points inside have multiple segments, points outside have none.\n\nTherefore, the problem says that point C is on AB, not A or B, and does not lie on any segment from F except AB. That would mean that C is on the astroid, since only the tangent segment at that point would pass through it, but AB is not tangent to the astroid? Wait, but AB is a member of F, so it is one of the lines, so if C is on AB and the astroid, then the tangent at C would be AB itself. Therefore, the point C must be where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nWait, so if AB is tangent to the astroid at point C, then that would be the unique point where only AB passes through it. Therefore, we need to find the point of tangency of AB with the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the point C on AB where AB is tangent to the astroid. Since AB is a line, we can compute its equation and find where it is tangent to the astroid.\n\nThe line AB has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2), as established earlier.\n\nWe need to find the point (x,y) on both AB and the astroid, such that the line AB is tangent to the astroid at that point.\n\nTo find the tangent points, we can use the condition for tangency between a line and the astroid.\n\nThe astroid equation is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.\n\nLet me parametrize the astroid. A standard parametrization is x = cos^3\u03b8, y= sin^3\u03b8, since then x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nYes, that works. So parametrization with parameter \u03b8:\n\nx = cos\u00b3\u03b8,\n\ny = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nThen, the tangent line to the astroid at parameter \u03b8 can be found by differentiating.\n\nCompute dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (dy/d\u03b8)/(dx/d\u03b8).\n\nCompute derivatives:\n\ndx/d\u03b8 = 3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 (-sin\u03b8) = -3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8,\n\ndy/d\u03b8 = 3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nThus, dy/dx = [3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8]/[ -3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 ] = - (sin\u03b8)/(cos\u03b8) = -tan\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent line at point \u03b8 is -tan\u03b8.\n\nThe equation of the tangent line at \u03b8 is:\n\n(y - sin\u00b3\u03b8) = -tan\u03b8 (x - cos\u00b3\u03b8)\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\ny = -tan\u03b8 x + tan\u03b8 cos\u00b3\u03b8 + sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\ntan\u03b8 cos\u00b3\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 * cos\u00b3\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nand sin\u00b3\u03b8,\n\nso:\n\ny = -tan\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b3\u03b8 = -tan\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = -tan\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the tangent line at parameter \u03b8 is y = -tan\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, the line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe need to find \u03b8 such that the tangent line to the astroid is AB. So set:\n\n-tan\u03b8 = -sqrt(3),\n\nand\n\nsin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nFrom the first equation, tan\u03b8 = sqrt(3), so \u03b8=60\u00b0 (pi/3 radians).\n\nCheck the second equation: sin(60\u00b0)=sqrt(3)/2, which matches. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the tangent point is at \u03b8=60\u00b0, so the coordinates are:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(60\u00b0)= (0.5)^3 =1/8,\n\ny= sin\u00b3(60\u00b0)= ( (sqrt(3)/2) )^3 = (3sqrt(3))/8.\n\nTherefore, the point of tangency is (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). This point must lie on AB.\n\nLet me verify that:\n\nAB's equation: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlug in x=1/8:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8. Which matches. So yes, that point is on AB and the astroid, and the tangent line there is AB itself.\n\nTherefore, this is the point C, since it is the only point on AB (other than possibly others?) where the line AB is tangent to the astroid, hence the only segment through C from F is AB.\n\nWait, but we need to confirm that this is the only such point. Since AB is a line that is tangent to the astroid at this point, and since the astroid is convex, there should be only one point of tangency with AB. Hence, this is the unique point C.\n\nTherefore, point C is (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). Then, we need to compute OC\u00b2, which is (1/8)^2 + (3sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/64) + (27/64) = (1 +27)/64 =28/64 =7/16.\n\nWait, 3 squared is 9, times 3 is 27, yes. So 1 +27 is 28, so 28/64 reduces to 7/16. So OC\u00b2 =7/16, so p=7, q=16, which are coprime. Therefore, p + q=23.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check again the coordinates of C.\n\nWait, when \u03b8=60\u00b0, which is pi/3, so cos(theta)=0.5, sin(theta)=sqrt(3)/2. So,\n\nx=cos^3(theta)= (1/2)^3=1/8,\n\ny= sin^3(theta)= (sqrt(3)/2)^3= (3*sqrt(3))/8. Correct.\n\nThen, OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3\u221a3 /8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64=28/64=7/16. So yes, 7/16. So 7+16=23.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 23. Wait, but the problem says \"unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B\". Let me confirm that this point is different from A and B. Point A is (1/2,0), which is 4/8 vs 1/8, so yes. Point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2)= (0, 4sqrt(3)/8), so y-coordinate here is 3sqrt(3)/8, which is less, so different. So yes, it's distinct. Therefore, the answer should be 23.\n\nBut let me double-check if there could be another point.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to solve this geometry problem. Let me read it again carefully.\n\nWe have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all segments PQ of unit length in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. There's a unique point C on segment AB, not A or B, that isn't on any segment from F except AB itself. We need to find OC squared, express it as p/q with p and q coprime, then find p + q.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to understand what the family F is. Each segment in F is a unit length segment from a point on the x-axis to a point on the y-axis in the first quadrant. So, for any such segment PQ, P has coordinates (p, 0) and Q has coordinates (0, q), with the distance between them being 1. The distance formula gives sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. So all such segments lie on the unit circle but with endpoints on the axes.\n\nWait, but since they are in the first quadrant, p and q are non-negative. So all these segments are parts of lines from (p,0) to (0,q) where p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. \n\nThe problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that is not on any of these segments except AB. So, point C is on AB, and the only segment from F that passes through C is AB itself. So, if I can find such a point C, then compute OC squared.\n\nFirst, let me parametrize segment AB. Let me find the coordinates of points on AB. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the segment AB can be parametrized as:\n\nLet\u2019s use a parameter t where t goes from 0 to 1. When t=0, we are at A, and t=1 at B. So coordinates would be:\n\nx = (1/2)(1 - t)\n\ny = (sqrt(3)/2) t\n\nSo any point C on AB can be written as ( (1/2)(1 - t), (sqrt(3)/2) t ) for some t between 0 and 1. Since we need the point distinct from A and B, t is between 0 and 1 but not 0 or 1.\n\nNow, the key is that this point C is not on any segment from F except AB. That means, for any other segment PQ in F (other than AB itself), C is not on PQ. So, if we can find a point C on AB such that whenever C is on some PQ in F, then that PQ must be AB. So, we need to find such a point C where the only PQ in F containing it is AB.\n\nAlternatively, if we can show that for point C, any line through C with endpoints on the axes at distance 1 must be AB. So, perhaps C is such that the only such line through it is AB. Therefore, perhaps C is the point where all other possible lines PQ (from F) would not pass through it, except AB.\n\nAlternatively, maybe C is a point where the only unit-length segment from the x-axis to y-axis passing through it is AB. So, if I can find such a point, then that's our C.\n\nTo approach this, perhaps we can consider the set of all lines PQ in F. Each such line can be represented by an equation, and the point C must lie only on the line AB among all these lines. So, the problem reduces to finding a point C on AB such that it does not lie on any other line from F except AB.\n\nAlternatively, for point C, if we suppose that it lies on another segment PQ in F, then that PQ must coincide with AB. So, we need to ensure that if there exists another PQ through C, then PQ is AB.\n\nTo find such a point C, perhaps we can set up equations and find the point where only AB passes through it among all the possible PQ lines.\n\nLet me think. Let\u2019s suppose that point C is (x, y). Since it's on AB, we can express y in terms of x. Let me first find the equation of AB. Since A is (1/2,0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation is y = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). Therefore, y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). So, for any point C on AB, its coordinates satisfy y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nNow, suppose that C lies on some segment PQ in F. Then PQ is a segment from (p,0) to (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, and the point (x,y) lies on the line PQ. Let me write the equation of line PQ.\n\nThe line PQ goes from (p,0) to (0,q). The equation can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1. Because in intercept form, the equation is x/p + y/q = 1.\n\nSo, if point C (x,y) is on this line, then x/p + y/q = 1. Also, since PQ has length 1, we have p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nTherefore, for point C to lie on such a line PQ (other than AB itself), there must exist some p and q with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 and x/p + y/q =1. But since we want C to not lie on any such line except AB, the only solution (p,q) to these equations must be the one corresponding to AB.\n\nTherefore, we need that the system of equations:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nhas only one solution (p,q) corresponding to the segment AB.\n\nTherefore, to find point C, we need to find (x,y) on AB such that the above system has only one solution (p,q) on the unit circle in the first quadrant, which is the one corresponding to AB. So, we need to set up this condition.\n\nAlternatively, since the system must have only one solution, the equations must be such that when we solve them, there is only one (p,q). Let me try to set this up.\n\nGiven that (x,y) is on AB, so y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. Let me denote that as equation (1). Let me also note that for point C (x,y) on AB, the equations x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 must have only the solution (p,q) corresponding to AB. Let me find the coordinates of AB's endpoints: A is (1/2,0), so that would correspond to p =1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2? Wait, hold on. Wait, AB is from A(1/2, 0) to B(0, sqrt(3)/2). So the segment AB itself is part of the family F?\n\nWait, let me check if AB is indeed in family F. The length of AB: distance between A(1/2,0) and B(0,sqrt(3)/2) is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt( 1/4 + 3/4 ) = sqrt(1) =1. So yes, AB is a member of F. So the problem says that point C is on AB, not equal to A or B, and does not belong to any segment from F other than AB. So, C is not on any other segment of F except AB. Therefore, the system above must have only the solution (p,q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2).\n\nTherefore, for the point C(x,y), the equations x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1 must have only the solution (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). So, to ensure that, we need that when we solve the system, the only solution is p=1/2 and q= sqrt(3)/2.\n\nTherefore, substituting y from equation (1) into the first equation:\n\nx/p + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1.\n\nSo, that's one equation, and the other is p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Let me denote variables p and q here, with p and q positive (since they are intercepts in first quadrant).\n\nSo, perhaps to make the system have only one solution, the equations must be tangent in some sense? Maybe the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1? Wait, no, because p and q are variables here. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, suppose we treat p and q as variables, and for the given x and y (on AB), we can think of the equation x/p + y/q =1 as a linear equation in variables 1/p and 1/q? Not sure. Alternatively, we can write this as:\n\nLet me rearrange the equation x/p + y/q =1. Let me denote u = 1/p and v =1/q, so the equation becomes x u + y v =1. But p and q must satisfy p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, we can consider that for given x and y, the equation x/p + y/q =1 must have only one solution (p, q) on the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1. To find such (x,y), so that the system has only one solution. So, in other words, the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1? Wait, but here p and q are variables. Wait, actually, in this case, if we consider p and q as variables, then the equation x/p + y/q =1 and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, so the intersection points between the line and the circle must be only one point, so the line is tangent to the circle.\n\nTherefore, the condition is that the line x/p + y/q =1 is tangent to the unit circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Therefore, the system has exactly one solution (p, q). So, to have this tangency condition, the distance from the origin to the line x/p + y/q =1 must be equal to the radius, which is 1? Wait, but the line is in terms of p and q? Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of p and q as coordinates.\n\nWait a second, perhaps I need to switch variables here. Let me see:\n\nSuppose we consider p and q as coordinates in the plane, then the unit circle is p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, and the line x/p + y/q =1 must be tangent to this circle. Therefore, for the line x/p + y/q =1 to be tangent to the circle p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, the condition for tangency is that the distance from the center (0,0) to the line is equal to the radius (1). Wait, but the line is in terms of p and q? Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the line x/p + y/q =1 can be rewritten as q x + p y = p q. But since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can use Lagrange multipliers or some substitution.\n\nAlternatively, let me parametrize p and q on the unit circle. Let me set p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, and since p and q are positive (as intercepts on positive axes), \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2.\n\nThen, substituting into the equation x/p + y/q =1, we get:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nSo, for point C(x,y), this equation must have only one solution \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2). Therefore, the equation x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1 must have only one solution \u03b8 for the given x and y on AB.\n\nTherefore, we need that this equation has exactly one solution \u03b8 in (0, \u03c0/2). So, the function f(\u03b8) = x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 -1 must have exactly one root in that interval.\n\nTo have exactly one solution, the function f(\u03b8) must cross zero exactly once. To ensure that, perhaps the function is monotonic? Or maybe it has a minimum that touches zero? Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since we want only one \u03b8 where this holds, perhaps the minimum of f(\u03b8) is zero, or something like that. Hmm, perhaps calculus can help here. Let me consider f(\u03b8) = x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 -1. To find its critical points, take derivative with respect to \u03b8 and set to zero.\n\nBut before that, since x and y are related via the AB line, let me substitute y from AB into this equation. Since y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2, so let's substitute that.\n\nSo f(\u03b8) = x / cos\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sin\u03b8 -1 = 0.\n\nLet me denote x as variable, since the point C is (x,y) on AB, so x can be between 0 and 1/2 (since A is at 1/2, and moving towards B at (0, sqrt(3)/2)). So x is between 0 and 1/2, and y correspondingly from sqrt(3)/2 down to 0.\n\nSo, let's write f(\u03b8) in terms of x and \u03b8:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sin\u03b8 -1 =0.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3)/2:\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nx [1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8] + sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8) -1 =0.\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe set up the equation and find when it has only one solution \u03b8.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that the equation x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1 must have exactly one solution \u03b8. Let me write y in terms of x as y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. So substituting:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + [ -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3)/2:\n\nLet me see:\n\nLet me denote sqrt(3) as s for simplicity. Then,\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + [ -s x + s/2 ] / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nx (1/cos\u03b8 - s / sin\u03b8) + (s)/(2 sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nHmm, perhaps group terms differently. Alternatively, let me combine terms over a common denominator. Let me see:\n\nMultiply both sides by sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx sin\u03b8 + [ -s x + s/2 ] cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nLet me expand that:\n\nx sin\u03b8 - s x cos\u03b8 + (s/2) cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nBring all terms to left side:\n\nx sin\u03b8 - s x cos\u03b8 + (s/2) cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated, but maybe we can collect like terms.\n\nLet me group terms with sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 (x - cos\u03b8) + cos\u03b8 (-s x + s/2 - sin\u03b8) =0.\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe rearrange terms:\n\nx sin\u03b8 - s x cos\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - (s/2) cos\u03b8\n\nFactor x on the left:\n\nx (sin\u03b8 - s cos\u03b8) = cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - s/2 )\n\nHmm, so:\n\nx = [ cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - s/2 ) ] / ( sin\u03b8 - s cos\u03b8 )\n\nBut s is sqrt(3). Let me substitute back s = sqrt(3):\n\nx = [ cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2 ) ) ] / ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 )\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be simplified. Let me see:\n\nLet me denote numerator and denominator:\n\nNumerator: cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nDenominator: sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8\n\nHmm, note that the denominator is sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8. Let me see if the numerator can be written in terms of the denominator. Let me compute:\n\nLet me see:\n\nsin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 = ?\n\nNot directly. Alternatively, let me factor something out. Let me see:\n\nAlternatively, let me write the numerator:\n\ncos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8\n\nDenominator: sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8\n\nHmm, perhaps factor sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 from numerator? Let me see:\n\nNumerator: cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8) = sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 - (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8\n\nHmm, maybe we can factor cos\u03b8:\n\ncos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nDenominator: sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8\n\nSo, x = [ cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 )\n\nHmm, maybe we can manipulate this expression further. Let me see:\n\nLet me write the denominator as sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8. Let me note that sqrt(3) is tan(60\u00b0), so perhaps express this in terms of tangent?\n\nLet me set phi such that tan phi = sqrt(3), so phi = 60\u00b0, so perhaps using angle addition formulas. Alternatively, let me consider writing denominator as sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 = 2 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0). Wait, let me check:\n\nUsing the identity: a sin\u03b8 + b cos\u03b8 = C sin(\u03b8 + phi). Wait, actually:\n\nLet me recall that A sin\u03b8 + B cos\u03b8 = C sin(theta + phi). Let me compute for the denominator:\n\nsin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8. Let me write this as:\n\n= 1*sin\u03b8 + (-sqrt(3)) cos\u03b8\n\nThe amplitude is sqrt(1 + (sqrt(3))\u00b2) = sqrt(1 +3)=2.\n\nSo, sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 = 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0), since:\n\nsin(theta - 60\u00b0) = sin theta cos60\u00b0 - cos theta sin60\u00b0 = (1/2) sin theta - (sqrt(3)/2) cos theta.\n\nTherefore, 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0) = sin theta - sqrt(3) cos theta. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, denominator is 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0).\n\nSimilarly, the numerator:\n\ncos theta ( sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nHmm, perhaps also express sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 in terms of some angle? Not sure, but maybe proceed.\n\nTherefore, x = [ cos theta ( sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0) ]\n\nHmm, perhaps simplifying numerator and denominator.\n\nLet me note that sin(theta) - sqrt(3)/2 is a linear term, but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps express sin(theta) as something. Alternatively, maybe plug in specific angles where this equation holds?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps think of this as an equation in theta, and we want this to have only one solution theta in (0, pi/2). Therefore, for a given x, the equation x = [ ... ] must have only one solution theta. So, perhaps the function f(theta) = [ cos theta ( sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0) ] must be such that it takes the value x exactly once.\n\nTo have only one solution, this function must be monotonic, or have a extremum that touches x exactly once. To find such x where this occurs, we can look for critical points where the function has a horizontal tangent, i.e., derivative zero. That would correspond to the point where the function has a minimum or maximum, so that x is at that extremum, hence only one solution.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the point C corresponds to the extremum of this function f(theta). Let me try to compute the derivative of f(theta) with respect to theta and set it to zero.\n\nFirst, let me denote f(theta) as:\n\nf(theta) = [ cos theta ( sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 ) ] / [ 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0) ]\n\nLet me compute f'(theta). This might be complicated, but let me proceed step by step.\n\nLet me denote numerator N(theta) = cos theta ( sin theta - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nDenominator D(theta) = 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0)\n\nTherefore, f(theta) = N(theta)/D(theta)\n\nThen, f\u2019(theta) = [N\u2019(theta) D(theta) - N(theta) D\u2019(theta)] / [D(theta)]\u00b2\n\nFirst compute N\u2019(theta):\n\nN(theta) = cos theta ( sin theta - c ), where c = sqrt(3)/2\n\nN\u2019(theta) = -sin theta ( sin theta - c ) + cos theta ( cos theta )\n\n= -sin\u00b2 theta + c sin theta + cos\u00b2 theta\n\n= (cos\u00b2 theta - sin\u00b2 theta) + c sin theta\n\n= cos(2 theta) + c sin theta\n\nWait, cos\u00b2 - sin\u00b2 is cos(2 theta). So, that's correct.\n\nThen, D(theta) = 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0), so D\u2019(theta) = 2 cos(theta - 60\u00b0)\n\nTherefore, putting into f\u2019(theta):\n\nf\u2019(theta) = [ (cos(2 theta) + c sin theta ) * 2 sin(theta - 60\u00b0) - cos theta ( sin theta - c ) * 2 cos(theta - 60\u00b0) ] / [4 sin\u00b2(theta - 60\u00b0)]\n\nThis is quite complex. Let me see if I can simplify numerator step by step.\n\nLet me factor out the 2 in numerator:\n\nNumerator:\n\n2 [ (cos(2 theta) + c sin theta ) sin(theta - 60\u00b0) - cos theta ( sin theta - c ) cos(theta - 60\u00b0) ]\n\nLet me denote c = sqrt(3)/2 for simplicity.\n\nLet me expand term by term:\n\nFirst term: (cos2\u03b8 + c sin\u03b8) sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nSecond term: - cos\u03b8 (sin\u03b8 - c) cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nLet me compute each part separately.\n\nFirst term:\n\ncos2\u03b8 * sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + c sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nSecond term:\n\n- cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + c cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nHmm, combining all terms:\n\nTotal numerator inside the brackets:\n\ncos2\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + c sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + c cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nHmm, let me see if terms can be combined.\n\nFirst and fourth terms have c:\n\nc [ sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) ]\n\nThe expression inside the brackets is cos( (\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) - \u03b8 ) = cos(-60\u00b0) = cos60\u00b0 = 0.5. Wait, because cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. Wait, actually, cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. So here, sin\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) + cos\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) = cos(\u03b8 - (\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)) = cos(60\u00b0) = 0.5.\n\nTherefore, the first and fourth terms together give c * 0.5.\n\nThe remaining terms are:\n\ncos2\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0)\n\nLet me look at these terms.\n\nLet me note that cos2\u03b8 = cos\u00b2\u03b8 - sin\u00b2\u03b8, but not sure if helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps factor terms:\n\nTake the second remaining term: -cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0). Let me see if this can be combined with the first remaining term.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider cos2\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0):\n\nExpress cos2\u03b8 as sin(\u03c0/2 - 2\u03b8), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use product-to-sum formulas.\n\nLet me recall that sin A cos B = [ sin(A+B) + sin(A-B) ] / 2\n\nSimilarly, cos A sin B = [ sin(A+B) - sin(A-B) ] / 2\n\nLet me see:\n\nFirst term: cos2\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) = [ sin( (2\u03b8) + (\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) ) - sin( (2\u03b8) - (\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) ) ] / 2\n\nWait, using the identity sin B cos A = [ sin(A+B) + sin(B - A) ] / 2. Wait, actually, cos2\u03b8 sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) = sin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) cos2\u03b8.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nsin(\u03b8 - 60\u00b0) cos2\u03b8 = [ sin( (\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + 2\u03b8 ) + sin( (\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - 2\u03b8 ) ] /2\n\n= [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(-\u03b8 -60\u00b0) ] /2\n\n= [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2\n\nSimilarly, the second term:\n\n- cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 -60\u00b0) = - [ (sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8) cos(\u03b8 -60\u00b0) ]\n\nHmm, let me see:\n\nsin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 = (1/2) sin2\u03b8, so:\n\n- (1/2) sin2\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 -60\u00b0)\n\nThen, using product-to-sum:\n\nsin2\u03b8 cos(\u03b8 -60\u00b0) = [ sin(2\u03b8 + \u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(2\u03b8 - (\u03b8 -60\u00b0) ) ] /2\n\n= [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2\n\nTherefore,\n\n- (1/2) * [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2 = - [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nPutting together the first and second remaining terms:\n\nFirst term's expansion: [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2\n\nSecond term's expansion: - [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nSo total:\n\n[ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2 - [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nLet me combine these fractions over 4:\n\n= 2[ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] - [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) + sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] all over 4\n\n= [2 sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - 2 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) - sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\n= [ (2 sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) - sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0)) + (-2 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) - sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ) ] /4\n\n= [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nSo combining everything, the entire numerator inside the brackets becomes:\n\nc*(0.5) + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nRecall that c = sqrt(3)/2, so:\n\n= (sqrt(3)/2)(0.5) + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\n= sqrt(3)/4 + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4\n\nTherefore, the entire numerator of f\u2019(theta) is 2 times this:\n\nNumerator_total = 2 [ sqrt(3)/4 + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /4 ]\n\n= sqrt(3)/2 + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2\n\nThus,\n\nf\u2019(theta) = [ sqrt(3)/2 + ( sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ) /2 ] / [4 sin\u00b2(theta -60\u00b0) ]\n\nHmm, this is still quite complicated, but perhaps setting numerator equal to zero for critical points.\n\nSet numerator_total =0:\n\nsqrt(3)/2 + [ sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) ] /2 =0\n\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n\nsqrt(3) + sin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) =0\n\nTherefore:\n\nsin(3\u03b8 -60\u00b0) -3 sin(\u03b8 +60\u00b0) = -sqrt(3)\n\nHmm, solving this equation for theta. This seems quite involved. Maybe there's a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps instead of going through calculus, we can think geometrically. The point C must lie on AB and such that any other segment from F passing through C must coincide with AB. So, C is the point where the only unit segment from x-axis to y-axis through it is AB. So, perhaps C is the point where the two segments from F are tangent to AB? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, C is such that it's the \"closest\" point on AB to the unit circle in some sense? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of all possible segments PQ in F as lines from (p,0) to (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. The envelope of these lines might form a curve, and point C is where this envelope touches AB. So, perhaps the envelope of the lines PQ in F is a curve, and C is the intersection point of the envelope with AB.\n\nCalculating the envelope of a family of lines can be done using calculus. Let me recall that the envelope of a family of curves satisfies both the equation of the curve and the derivative with respect to the parameter set to zero.\n\nLet me parametrize the family of lines. Let me use parameter \u03b8 as before, where p = cos\u03b8, q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. Then the line equation is x/p + y/q =1, so substituting p and q:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nTo find the envelope, we take the derivative with respect to \u03b8 and set it to zero.\n\nLet me denote the equation as F(x,y,\u03b8)= x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 -1 =0.\n\nThe envelope condition is:\n\nF(x,y,\u03b8)=0,\n\ndF/d\u03b8 =0.\n\nCompute dF/d\u03b8:\n\nd/d\u03b8 [x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 -1] = x (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 + y (-cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nTherefore:\n\nx (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo, the envelope conditions are:\n\n1. x / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\n2. x (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 - y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8 =0.\n\nWe can solve these equations for x and y in terms of \u03b8, then eliminate \u03b8 to find the envelope curve.\n\nLet me solve equation 2 for y:\n\nFrom equation 2:\n\nx (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 = y (cos\u03b8)/sin\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nso,\n\ny = x (sin\u03b8)/cos\u00b2\u03b8 * sin\u00b2\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 = x sin\u00b3\u03b8 / cos\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nSo, y = x (tan\u03b8)^3.\n\nLet me denote t = tan\u03b8. Since \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2, t is positive.\n\nThen, y = x t^3.\n\nNow, substitute this into equation 1:\n\nx / cos\u03b8 + y / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nExpress cos\u03b8 and sin\u03b8 in terms of t:\n\ncos\u03b8 =1/ sqrt(1 + t\u00b2),\n\nsin\u03b8 = t / sqrt(1 + t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore,\n\nx * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) + y * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)/t =1.\n\nBut y =x t^3, so substitute that:\n\nx sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) + (x t^3) * sqrt(1 + t\u00b2)/t =1\n\nSimplify:\n\nx sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) + x t^2 sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) =1\n\nFactor:\n\nx sqrt(1 + t\u00b2) (1 + t\u00b2) =1\n\nTherefore,\n\nx (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2) =1,\n\nso,\n\nx = 1/( (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2) )\n\nBut since y =x t^3,\n\ny = t^3 / (1 + t\u00b2)^(3/2)\n\nThus, the envelope is parametrized by t as:\n\nx = 1/(1 + t\u00b2)^{3/2},\n\ny = t^3/(1 + t\u00b2)^{3/2}\n\nAlternatively, we can write this as:\n\nx = (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2},\n\ny = t^3 (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2}\n\nLet me see if we can write this in Cartesian coordinates. Let me set t = y/x^{1/3}, since y = t^3 x. Hmm, maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, note that (x)^{2/3} + (y)^{2/3} = [ (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2} ]^{2/3} + [ t^3 (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2} ]^{2/3}\n\nWait, let me compute:\n\nLet me compute x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}:\n\n= [ (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2} ]^{2/3} + [ t^3 (1 + t\u00b2)^{-3/2} ]^{2/3}\n\n= (1 + t\u00b2)^{-1} + t^2 (1 + t\u00b2)^{-1}\n\n= [1 + t\u00b2]/(1 + t\u00b2) ) =1\n\nTherefore, x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1. Ah! So the envelope of these lines is the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.\n\nWow, that's a nice result. So the envelope is an astroid. Therefore, the family of lines PQ in F form an astroid as their envelope. Therefore, the envelope is the astroid curve x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.\n\nTherefore, the point C must lie on AB and also on the astroid, because the astroid is the envelope, so any point on the astroid lies on exactly one such line PQ (the tangent line). Wait, actually, points on the envelope lie on exactly one member of the family, which is the tangent line at that point. So, the envelope points are exactly the points that lie on only one segment from F. Since the problem states that C is on AB and not on any segment from F except AB, so C must be the intersection point of AB and the astroid, other than A and B.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the intersection of AB with the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1, other than points A and B.\n\nWait, but let's check points A and B:\n\nPoint A is (1/2,0). Plugging into the astroid equation:\n\n( (1/2)^{2/3} ) + 0 = (1/2)^{2/3} \u2248 0.63 <1, so it's inside the astroid. Hmm, but the astroid equation is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1. Wait, the astroid is actually the boundary of the set of points reachable by segments of length 1 from the axes? Wait, but the envelope is the astroid, so points on the astroid are points where only one such segment passes through them, and inside the astroid, there are multiple segments passing through them, and outside none? Hmm, actually, the envelope is the boundary where each point has exactly one tangent line from the family. So, points inside the astroid can be reached by multiple segments, and outside cannot be reached at all.\n\nTherefore, the problem states that point C is on AB and not on any segment from F except AB, so it must lie on the astroid. Because otherwise, if it's inside the astroid, it would lie on multiple segments, and if it's outside, it wouldn't lie on any. Therefore, the only points on AB that are on the astroid are the intersections. Since A and B are on the astroid? Wait, let me check:\n\nWait point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). Let me plug into the astroid equation:\n\n0 + (sqrt(3)/2)^{2/3} = ( (3^{1/2}/2) )^{2/3 } = (3^{1}/2^{2})^{1/3} = (3/4)^{1/3} \u2248 0.908 <1. So, actually, point B is also inside the astroid. Wait, then where are the intersection points?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me recast:\n\nWait the astroid equation is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} =1. Let me plug in point A (1/2,0):\n\n( (1/2)^{2/3} ) +0 \u2248 (0.63) which is less than 1, so inside.\n\nSimilarly, point B (0, sqrt(3)/2):\n\n( sqrt(3)/2 )^{2/3} = ( (3)^{1/2}/2 )^{2/3} = (3^{1}/2^2)^{1/3} = (3/4)^{1/3} \u2248 0.908 <1, so inside as well.\n\nHmm, so then the segment AB is entirely inside the astroid? Then, how does the problem state that C is on AB and not on any segment from F except AB? Because if the entire AB is inside the astroid, then points on AB would lie on multiple segments from F. But the problem says there is a unique such point C. Maybe my envelope reasoning is off?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the envelope calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nThe envelope of the lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nWait, actually, the envelope of lines x/p + y/q =1 with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1 is indeed the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1. Let me confirm with a standard example. The standard astroid is the envelope of segments of length 1 moving with endpoints on the axes. Wait, actually, yes, that's exactly the case here. So the envelope should be the astroid. So points on the astroid have exactly one such segment passing through them, tangent to the astroid. Points inside have multiple segments, points outside have none.\n\nTherefore, the problem says that point C is on AB, not A or B, and does not lie on any segment from F except AB. That would mean that C is on the astroid, since only the tangent segment at that point would pass through it, but AB is not tangent to the astroid? Wait, but AB is a member of F, so it is one of the lines, so if C is on AB and the astroid, then the tangent at C would be AB itself. Therefore, the point C must be where AB is tangent to the astroid.\n\nWait, so if AB is tangent to the astroid at point C, then that would be the unique point where only AB passes through it. Therefore, we need to find the point of tangency of AB with the astroid x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.\n\nTherefore, the problem reduces to finding the point C on AB where AB is tangent to the astroid. Since AB is a line, we can compute its equation and find where it is tangent to the astroid.\n\nThe line AB has equation y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2), as established earlier.\n\nWe need to find the point (x,y) on both AB and the astroid, such that the line AB is tangent to the astroid at that point.\n\nTo find the tangent points, we can use the condition for tangency between a line and the astroid.\n\nThe astroid equation is x^{2/3} + y^{2/3}=1.\n\nLet me parametrize the astroid. A standard parametrization is x = cos^3\u03b8, y= sin^3\u03b8, since then x^{2/3} + y^{2/3} = cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 =1.\n\nYes, that works. So parametrization with parameter \u03b8:\n\nx = cos\u00b3\u03b8,\n\ny = sin\u00b3\u03b8.\n\nThen, the tangent line to the astroid at parameter \u03b8 can be found by differentiating.\n\nCompute dy/dx:\n\ndy/dx = (dy/d\u03b8)/(dx/d\u03b8).\n\nCompute derivatives:\n\ndx/d\u03b8 = 3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 (-sin\u03b8) = -3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8,\n\ndy/d\u03b8 = 3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8.\n\nThus, dy/dx = [3 sin\u00b2\u03b8 cos\u03b8]/[ -3 cos\u00b2\u03b8 sin\u03b8 ] = - (sin\u03b8)/(cos\u03b8) = -tan\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the slope of the tangent line at point \u03b8 is -tan\u03b8.\n\nThe equation of the tangent line at \u03b8 is:\n\n(y - sin\u00b3\u03b8) = -tan\u03b8 (x - cos\u00b3\u03b8)\n\nLet me rearrange this:\n\ny = -tan\u03b8 x + tan\u03b8 cos\u00b3\u03b8 + sin\u00b3\u03b8\n\nSimplify the terms:\n\ntan\u03b8 cos\u00b3\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 / cos\u03b8 * cos\u00b3\u03b8 = sin\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8,\n\nand sin\u00b3\u03b8,\n\nso:\n\ny = -tan\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8 cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b3\u03b8 = -tan\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8 (cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8 ) = -tan\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8.\n\nTherefore, the tangent line at parameter \u03b8 is y = -tan\u03b8 x + sin\u03b8.\n\nNow, the line AB is y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nWe need to find \u03b8 such that the tangent line to the astroid is AB. So set:\n\n-tan\u03b8 = -sqrt(3),\n\nand\n\nsin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2.\n\nFrom the first equation, tan\u03b8 = sqrt(3), so \u03b8=60\u00b0 (pi/3 radians).\n\nCheck the second equation: sin(60\u00b0)=sqrt(3)/2, which matches. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the tangent point is at \u03b8=60\u00b0, so the coordinates are:\n\nx = cos\u00b3(60\u00b0)= (0.5)^3 =1/8,\n\ny= sin\u00b3(60\u00b0)= ( (sqrt(3)/2) )^3 = (3sqrt(3))/8.\n\nTherefore, the point of tangency is (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). This point must lie on AB.\n\nLet me verify that:\n\nAB's equation: y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nPlug in x=1/8:\n\ny = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = (-sqrt(3)/8 + 4 sqrt(3)/8 ) = (3 sqrt(3))/8. Which matches. So yes, that point is on AB and the astroid, and the tangent line there is AB itself.\n\nTherefore, this is the point C, since it is the only point on AB (other than possibly others?) where the line AB is tangent to the astroid, hence the only segment through C from F is AB.\n\nWait, but we need to confirm that this is the only such point. Since AB is a line that is tangent to the astroid at this point, and since the astroid is convex, there should be only one point of tangency with AB. Hence, this is the unique point C.\n\nTherefore, point C is (1/8, 3sqrt(3)/8). Then, we need to compute OC\u00b2, which is (1/8)^2 + (3sqrt(3)/8)^2.\n\nCompute that:\n\n(1/64) + (27/64) = (1 +27)/64 =28/64 =7/16.\n\nWait, 3 squared is 9, times 3 is 27, yes. So 1 +27 is 28, so 28/64 reduces to 7/16. So OC\u00b2 =7/16, so p=7, q=16, which are coprime. Therefore, p + q=23.\n\nWait, but hold on a second. Let me check again the coordinates of C.\n\nWait, when \u03b8=60\u00b0, which is pi/3, so cos(theta)=0.5, sin(theta)=sqrt(3)/2. So,\n\nx=cos^3(theta)= (1/2)^3=1/8,\n\ny= sin^3(theta)= (sqrt(3)/2)^3= (3*sqrt(3))/8. Correct.\n\nThen, OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3\u221a3 /8)^2 = 1/64 + 27/64=28/64=7/16. So yes, 7/16. So 7+16=23.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 23. Wait, but the problem says \"unique point C on AB, distinct from A and B\". Let me confirm that this point is different from A and B. Point A is (1/2,0), which is 4/8 vs 1/8, so yes. Point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2)= (0, 4sqrt(3)/8), so y-coordinate here is 3sqrt(3)/8, which is less, so different. So yes, it's distinct. Therefore, the answer should be 23.\n\nBut let me double-check if there could be another point. Since the line AB is tangent to the astroid at only one point, which is C, so that must be the unique point. Therefore, the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n\n\nGiven points \\( O(0,0) \\), \\( A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) \\), and \\( B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\), we need to find the unique point \\( C \\) on segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) (distinct from \\( A \\) and \\( B \\)) that does not lie on any segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) except \\( \\overline{AB} \\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all line segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. We need to find a unique point C on AB (not A or B) that isn't part of any segment in F except AB itself. Then compute OC\u00b2 and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q. \n\nFirst, let me visualize this. The points O, A, and B form a triangle. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the segment AB is part of this triangle. The family F is all these unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. Each such segment starts at some point P on the x-axis (so coordinates (p,0)) and ends at Q on the y-axis (coordinates (0,q)), with the distance between them being 1. So the distance formula gives sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. \n\nTherefore, each segment in F corresponds to a point (p, q) on the unit circle in the first quadrant, with p and q being the coordinates of P and Q respectively. Wait, actually, the coordinates of P are (p,0) and Q are (0,q), so the distance between them is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1. So the set of all such segments is parameterized by p and q where p \u2265 0, q \u2265 0, and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. \n\nNow, the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any segment from F except AB itself. So, point C must lie on AB, but isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments in F, they don't pass through C except for AB. So we need to find such a point C.\n\nFirst, let's parametrize AB. Let me find the equation of line AB. \n\nPoint A is (1/2, 0), and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) where t ranges from 0 to 1/2. Wait, actually, when t is 0, that's point B, and when t is 1/2, that's point A. Since we need C distinct from A and B, t is between 0 and 1/2, excluding the endpoints. \n\nNow, the key is that C is not on any segment PQ from F except AB. So suppose that C is on some segment PQ from F. Then, that segment PQ would have to pass through C, but since C is on AB, that would mean that PQ and AB intersect at point C. However, the problem states that C is only on AB and no other segment from F. Therefore, for point C, there should be no other segment PQ in F (other than AB itself) that passes through C. \n\nTherefore, to find C, we need to find a point on AB such that it is not on any other segment from F except AB. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some segment from F? Hmm, maybe. Let me think differently. \n\nSuppose that a segment PQ from F passes through C. Then, since PQ is a segment from the x-axis to the y-axis of unit length, its endpoints are (p,0) and (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. The line PQ can be parametrized as (p - pt, qt) where t goes from 0 to 1. Wait, actually, parametric equations for PQ: starting at (p,0) and moving to (0,q). The parametric equations can be written as x = p(1 - t), y = qt, where t \u2208 [0,1]. \n\nAlternatively, the equation of the line PQ can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, since intercept form. \n\nSo the line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1. \n\nSo for point C to lie on PQ, it must satisfy x_C / p + y_C / q = 1. \n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, we can express this equation in terms of p and q. \n\nGiven that C is on AB, its coordinates (x,y) satisfy y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nTherefore, substituting into the equation of PQ: \n\nx/p + [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) / q ] = 1. \n\nWe can rearrange this equation for x: \n\nx/p + (-sqrt(3)x)/q + (sqrt(3)/(2q)) = 1 \n\nGrouping the terms with x: \n\nx (1/p - sqrt(3)/q ) + sqrt(3)/(2q) = 1 \n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nx*( ( q - sqrt(3) p ) / (p q) ) + sqrt(3)/(2 q) = 1 \n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let me think of this as an equation in variables p and q. Since for the point C to lie on PQ, there must exist some p and q (with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1) such that the above equation holds. \n\nTherefore, for the point C to not lie on any PQ except AB, the only solution (p, q) to the equation must be the one corresponding to AB. \n\nWait, so AB is also a member of the family F? Let's check: AB has endpoints A (1/2,0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). The length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is indeed a member of F. \n\nTherefore, for point C on AB, which is part of AB, we want that the only segment in F that contains C is AB itself. So for any other segment PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. \n\nTherefore, we need to find a point C on AB (other than A and B) such that there does not exist any (p, q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, (p, q) \u2260 (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), such that the line PQ passes through C. \n\nSo, equivalently, the system of equations:\n\n1. p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\n2. x_C / p + y_C / q =1,\n\nmust have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, the equations must have only that solution. So, for the point C, the equations must be such that this is the only solution. \n\nTherefore, to find such a point C, perhaps we can set up the equations and find conditions on x_C and y_C so that the system has only that solution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the envelope of all these segments PQ. The envelope is a curve tangent to all these segments, and the point C might be where AB is tangent to the envelope? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is where the line AB is tangent to some envelope curve formed by the family F. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps parametrizing the problem. Let me try this step by step. \n\nLet me suppose that point C is (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2). Let me denote coordinates as (x, y) = (t, y(t)) where y(t) = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nWe need to ensure that the only segment PQ in F passing through C is AB itself. \n\nSo, for any other segment PQ (other than AB), the line PQ does not pass through C. \n\nTherefore, for the point C, the system of equations:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nmust have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, substituting x and y in terms of t, since x = t and y = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nthen the equation becomes:\n\nt/p + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1,\n\nalong with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need this system to have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, the equations must be such that when we solve them, the only solution is p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2. \n\nTherefore, let's write the first equation as:\n\nt/p + ( sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2t) ) / q =1. \n\nWait, let me compute the numerator of the second term:\n\n-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t = sqrt(3)(1/2 - t). \n\nSo the equation is:\n\nt/p + ( sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ) / q =1.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n(t)/p + ( sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ) / q =1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need this system to have only the solution (p, q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, let's consider this as a system in variables p and q, with t being a parameter (since we are looking for a specific t where this system has only that solution). \n\nLet me consider this as an equation in p and q. Let me rearrange the first equation:\n\nt/p + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t)/q =1.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) as some constant, say K. Then the equation is t/p + K/q =1. But maybe it's better to think of this as a linear equation in 1/p and 1/q. \n\nAlternatively, let me set variables u =1/p and v =1/q. Then the equation becomes t u + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) v =1. \n\nBut then we also have p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, which in terms of u and v is 1/u\u00b2 +1/v\u00b2 =1. Hmm, that might complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the first equation as t q + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p = pq,\n\nsince multiplying both sides by pq:\n\nt q + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p = pq.\n\nThen rearranged:\n\npq - t q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p =0.\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me think of this as a quadratic in p and q. Since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can substitute q from the first equation into the second equation. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the first equation:\n\nt/p + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t)/q =1,\n\nand the second equation p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe can try to solve this system for p and q. Let me see if we can express one variable in terms of the other. \n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\nt/p =1 - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t)/q,\n\nthen,\n\nt/p = [ q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ] / q,\n\nso cross multiplying,\n\nt q = p [ q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ]\n\n=> t q = p q - p sqrt(3)(1/2 - t)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt q - p q + p sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) =0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nq(t - p) + p sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) =0\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe another approach. Let me try to consider the equations as follows.\n\nLet me set variables p and q, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. \n\nThe point (p,0) to (0,q) must pass through (t, y(t)), where y(t) = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe line equation is x/p + y/q =1. So substituting x = t, y = y(t):\n\nt/p + y(t)/q =1.\n\nWe need this equation to have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, the system:\n\nt/p + y(t)/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nmust have exactly one solution. \n\nSo, for this to have only one solution, the equations must be such that when we solve them, there is only one pair (p, q). \n\nTherefore, substituting y(t) into the first equation, we can write this as an equation in p and q. Let me see if we can write this as a quadratic equation and set its discriminant to zero so that there is only one solution. \n\nLet me try to express one variable in terms of the other. Let me solve the first equation for q in terms of p. \n\nStarting with t/p + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by p q to eliminate denominators:\n\nt q + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] p = p q.\n\nRearranged:\n\np q - t q - [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] p =0.\n\nWait, let's see again:\n\nStarting over:\n\nt/p + [ sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ] / q =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by p q:\n\nt q + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p = p q,\n\nBring all terms to left-hand side:\n\np q - t q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t)p =0.\n\nFactor terms with p and q:\n\nq(p - t) - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p =0.\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me rearrange terms:\n\np q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p = t q,\n\nFactor p:\n\np [ q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ] = t q,\n\nThen,\n\np = [ t q ] / [ q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ]\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1:\n\n[ (t q)^2 / ( q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) )^2 ) ] + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps manageable. Let me denote D = sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) for simplicity. Then,\n\np = (t q)/(q - D),\n\nso substituting into p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\n(t\u00b2 q\u00b2)/(q - D)^2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nMultiply through by (q - D)^2 to eliminate denominator:\n\nt\u00b2 q\u00b2 + q\u00b2 (q - D)^2 = (q - D)^2,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt\u00b2 q\u00b2 + q\u00b2 (q - D)^2 - (q - D)^2 =0,\n\nFactor (q - D)^2 from last two terms:\n\nt\u00b2 q\u00b2 + (q - D)^2 ( q\u00b2 -1 ) =0,\n\nHmm, perhaps another substitution. Let me think of variable q here. Let me denote variable q, and write equation in terms of q. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to write everything in terms of q and then set the equation to have a double root. Since we want only one solution, the equation must have discriminant zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider this as a quadratic equation in q. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps parametrize using an angle. Since p and q are on the unit circle, we can set p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. \n\nWait, that's a good idea! Let me try that. \n\nLet me set p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2 (since p and q are positive in the first quadrant). \n\nThen, the equation of the line PQ is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1. \n\nThe point C(t, y(t)) must lie on this line, so:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + y(t)/ sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nBut y(t) = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nTherefore,\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + ( -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nt (1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8 ) + sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nHmm, so this equation must hold for some \u03b8, but we want that the only \u03b8 for which this holds is the \u03b8 corresponding to AB. \n\nThe segment AB corresponds to p =1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, cos\u03b8 =1/2, so \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, and sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2. \n\nSo, for the point C, the equation above must have \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 as its only solution. Therefore, the equation in \u03b8 must have only \u03b8= \u03c0/3 as a solution. \n\nTherefore, we can consider the equation:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nand we want this to be true only when \u03b8= \u03c0/3. \n\nTherefore, the equation must be an identity only at \u03b8= \u03c0/3, and no other \u03b8 in [0, \u03c0/2]. \n\nAlternatively, rearrange the equation to set it to zero:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) / sin\u03b8 -1 =0.\n\nLet me combine terms over a common denominator. Let me write everything over sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8:\n\n[ t sin\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 ] / ( sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nTherefore, numerator must be zero:\n\nt sin\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nt sin\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3) t cos\u03b8 ) - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nGroup terms with t:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nLet me factor cos\u03b8 in the second term:\n\n= t ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nLet me see if this can be written as a multiple of (\u03b8 - \u03c0/3). Since \u03b8=\u03c0/3 is a solution, perhaps we can write it as (\u03b8 - \u03c0/3) times something. \n\nAlternatively, let me plug in \u03b8=\u03c0/3 to check:\n\nAt \u03b8=\u03c0/3,\n\nsin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2,\n\ncos\u03b8 = 1/2,\n\nSo substituting:\n\nt ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)*(1/2) ) + (1/2)( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.\n\nIndeed, first term inside the t is sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 =0, and the second term is (1/2)(0)=0. So 0 +0=0, which holds. So \u03b8=\u03c0/3 is a solution, as expected. \n\nWe need this equation to have no other solutions. Therefore, the equation must be satisfied only when \u03b8=\u03c0/3. \n\nTo ensure that, the equation must have a double root at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, so that it only touches the axis there. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation can be written as a quadratic in some trigonometric function, and discriminant must be zero. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the equation:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) = - cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) = cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nHmm, perhaps factor sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8?\n\nAlternatively, let me divide both sides by (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ), but only if it's not zero. But at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)*(1/2)=0. So that's exactly the point where the denominator is zero. Hmm, tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of tan\u03b8. Let me set \u03c6 = \u03b8, and let me denote tan\u03b8 = t. Wait, but t is already used for the coordinate. Let me use another variable. Let me let k = tan\u03b8, so sin\u03b8 = k / sqrt(1 +k\u00b2), cos\u03b8 =1 / sqrt(1 +k\u00b2). Maybe this substitution can help. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider the equation as a linear equation in sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the equation:\n\nt sin\u03b8 - t sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 + (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nWait, expanding again:\n\nOriginal equation after expanding was:\n\nt sin\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3) t cos\u03b8 ) - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo grouping terms:\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t - sin\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, collect terms in sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose that the equation in \u03b8 has only \u03b8=\u03c0/3 as solution. So, when we consider the equation:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) =0,\n\nthis must hold only when \u03b8=\u03c0/3. \n\nLet me rearrange the equation as:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) = - cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 )\n\nLet me factor out terms:\n\nLeft side: t ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 )\n\nRight side: -cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) = cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) = cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) - cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) + (- sqrt(3) t cos\u03b8 - (- sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 )) =0\n\nWait, perhaps expanding:\n\n= t sin\u03b8 - t sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 ) cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nGroup terms with sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( - t sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) + sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ( - t + 1/2 ) =0.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3):\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ( t - 1/2 ) =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be written as a multiple of some function. Let me see if I can write this as a single sine or cosine function. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of this as an equation that must hold only when \u03b8=\u03c0/3. To ensure uniqueness, the equation must be satisfied only at that angle, so perhaps the equation can be written as a function that has a double root there. \n\nAlternatively, consider this as an equation in \u03b8, and set the derivative at \u03b8=\u03c0/3 to zero so that it's a double root. \n\nLet me denote the left-hand side of the equation as F(\u03b8):\n\nF(\u03b8) = t ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 )\n\nWe want F(\u03b8)=0 only at \u03b8=\u03c0/3. To ensure this, F(\u03b8) must have a double root at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, so that F(\u03b8)= (\u03b8 - \u03c0/3)^2 * ... but since it's a transcendental equation, maybe another approach. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider F(\u03b8)=0 has a double root at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, then F(\u03c0/3)=0 and F\u2019(\u03c0/3)=0. \n\nLet me compute F\u2019(\u03b8):\n\nFirst, F(\u03b8)= t sin\u03b8 - t sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute derivative directly from F(\u03b8)= t ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 )\n\nCompute derivative F\u2019(\u03b8):\n\n= t ( cos\u03b8 + sqrt(3) sin\u03b8 ) + [ -sin\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( -cos\u03b8 ) ]\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: derivative of t ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) is t ( cos\u03b8 + sqrt(3) sin\u03b8 )\n\nSecond term: derivative of cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ):\n\nUse product rule: -sin\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( -cos\u03b8 )\n\nSo altogether:\n\nF\u2019(\u03b8) = t ( cos\u03b8 + sqrt(3) sin\u03b8 ) - sin\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) - cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nNow, at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, we need both F(\u03b8)=0 and F\u2019(\u03b8)=0.\n\nWe already know F(\u03c0/3)=0. Let's compute F\u2019(\u03c0/3):\n\nFirst, compute each part at \u03b8=\u03c0/3:\n\ncos(\u03c0/3)=1/2, sin(\u03c0/3)=sqrt(3)/2,\n\ncos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1/4,\n\nsqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 =0,\n\nSo let's plug in:\n\nFirst term: t ( (1/2) + sqrt(3)*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = t (1/2 + 3/2 ) = t*(2) = 2t.\n\nSecond term: - sin\u03b8*(0) =0,\n\nThird term: -cos\u00b2\u03b8 = -1/4.\n\nThus, F\u2019(\u03c0/3) = 2t -1/4.\n\nTo have F\u2019(\u03c0/3)=0, set 2t -1/4=0 \u21d2 t=1/8.\n\nSo, if we set t=1/8, then \u03b8=\u03c0/3 is a double root, so the equation F(\u03b8)=0 would have only that solution (since the function touches zero there and doesn't cross). \n\nTherefore, the point C is at t=1/8 on AB. \n\nTherefore, coordinates of C are:\n\nx = t =1/8,\n\ny= -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/8 = (4 sqrt(3)/8 - sqrt(3)/8 ) = 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nTherefore, coordinates (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nTherefore, OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, 1 squared is 1, (3 sqrt(3))\u00b2 is 9*3=27. So 1 +27=28, over 8\u00b2=64. 28/64 reduces to 7/16. \n\nTherefore OC\u00b2 =7/16, so p=7, q=16, which are coprime. Thus, p+q=23. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, first, when I set t=1/8, that is the x-coordinate of point C. Then the y-coordinate:\n\ny(t) = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nCalculating:\n\nsqrt(3)/2 is 4 sqrt(3)/8, so subtracting sqrt(3)/8 gives 3 sqrt(3)/8. That's correct.\n\nThen OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (1 + 27)/64 =28/64=7/16. \n\nYes, 7 and 16 are coprime, so 7+16=23. \n\nBut let me confirm that this is indeed the correct point. \n\nWait, when we set F\u2019(\u03c0/3)=0, we found t=1/8. That gives us the point where the equation has a double root, so that it only intersects at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, which is AB. \n\nTherefore, this should be the unique point C. \n\nAlternatively, let me check with another approach. Suppose that C is (1/8, 3\u221a3/8). Let me see if any other PQ segment passes through this point. \n\nSuppose there is another segment PQ with endpoints (p,0) and (0,q), p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, such that the line x/p + y/q=1 passes through (1/8, 3\u221a3/8). \n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n(1/8)/p + (3\u221a3/8)/q =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by 8:\n\n1/p + 3\u221a3/q =8,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nSuppose that (p, q) is not (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Let me see if there are other solutions. \n\nLet me suppose that p=1/2, then q must be sqrt(3)/2, which is the AB case. Let me see if there's another solution. \n\nLet me try to solve the equations:\n\n1/p + 3\u221a3/q =8,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nLet me denote variables p and q. Let me express q from the first equation:\n\n1/p + 3\u221a3/q =8 \u21d2 3\u221a3/q =8 -1/p \u21d2 q= 3\u221a3/(8 -1/p).\n\nBut this might be messy. Let me set variables. Let me let p = cos\u03b8, q=sin\u03b8 as before. Then the equation becomes:\n\n1/cos\u03b8 + 3\u221a3 / sin\u03b8 =8,\n\nand cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8=1.\n\nLet me denote this equation:\n\nsec\u03b8 + 3\u221a3 csc\u03b8 =8.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n1/cos\u03b8 + 3\u221a3 / sin\u03b8 =8.\n\nLet me set this as an equation in \u03b8 and see if there are solutions other than \u03b8=\u03c0/3. \n\nAt \u03b8=\u03c0/3,\n\ncos\u03b8=1/2, sin\u03b8=\u221a3/2,\n\nso 1/(1/2) + 3\u221a3/(\u221a3/2)= 2 + 3\u221a3 * 2/\u221a3 =2 +6=8. So that works. \n\nSuppose another angle, say \u03b8=\u03c0/6,\n\ncos\u03b8=\u221a3/2, sin\u03b8=1/2,\n\nthen 1/(\u221a3/2) + 3\u221a3/(1/2)= 2/\u221a3 + 6\u221a3 \u2248 1.1547 + 10.392 \u224811.546>8. So too big. \n\nWhat about \u03b8=\u03c0/2,\n\ncos\u03b8=0, which would make 1/cos\u03b8 undefined, so no.\n\n\u03b8 approaching 0: 1/cos\u03b8 approaches 1, 3\u221a3 / sin\u03b8 approaches infinity, so equation not satisfied. \n\nWhat about \u03b8=\u03c0/4,\n\ncos\u03b8=sin\u03b8=\u221a2/2,\n\nthen 1/(\u221a2/2) + 3\u221a3/(\u221a2/2)= 2/\u221a2 + 3\u221a3*2/\u221a2 \u22481.414 + 4.242*3\u2248 1.414 + 12.727\u224814.14>8.\n\nHmm. What about \u03b8=\u03c0/3 + some small angle? Let me check \u03b8=\u03c0/3 + \u03b5,\n\nSuppose \u03b8=\u03c0/3 + \u03b5, where \u03b5 is small. Let's see if there could be another solution near \u03c0/3.\n\nBut since at \u03b8=\u03c0/3 the derivative F\u2019(\u03b8)=0, so the function F(\u03b8)=0 has a double root there, so there are no other roots nearby. Thus, the only solution is \u03b8=\u03c0/3, so that would confirm that there is no other segment PQ through C except AB. \n\nTherefore, the point C is indeed (1/8, 3\u221a3/8) and OC\u00b2=7/16, so the answer is 7+16=23. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me check once more the OC squared:\n\nx-coordinate 1/8, y-coordinate 3\u221a3/8,\n\nso squared distance is (1/8)^2 + (3\u221a3 /8)^2 =1/64 + 27/64 =28/64=7/16. Yep. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. Hmm, so we have points O at (0,0), A at (1/2, 0), and B at (0, sqrt(3)/2). The family F consists of all line segments PQ of unit length lying in the first quadrant, where P is on the x-axis and Q is on the y-axis. We need to find a unique point C on AB (not A or B) that isn't part of any segment in F except AB itself. Then compute OC\u00b2 and express it as p/q where p and q are coprime, then find p + q. \n\nFirst, let me visualize this. The points O, A, and B form a triangle. Since A is (1/2, 0) and B is (0, sqrt(3)/2), the segment AB is part of this triangle. The family F is all these unit-length segments from the x-axis to the y-axis in the first quadrant. Each such segment starts at some point P on the x-axis (so coordinates (p,0)) and ends at Q on the y-axis (coordinates (0,q)), with the distance between them being 1. So the distance formula gives sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. \n\nTherefore, each segment in F corresponds to a point (p, q) on the unit circle in the first quadrant, with p and q being the coordinates of P and Q respectively. Wait, actually, the coordinates of P are (p,0) and Q are (0,q), so the distance between them is sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2) = 1. So the set of all such segments is parameterized by p and q where p \u2265 0, q \u2265 0, and p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. \n\nNow, the problem states that there's a unique point C on AB (other than A and B) that isn't on any segment from F except AB itself. So, point C must lie on AB, but isn't on any other segment from F except AB. So, for all other segments in F, they don't pass through C except for AB. So we need to find such a point C.\n\nFirst, let's parametrize AB. Let me find the equation of line AB. \n\nPoint A is (1/2, 0), and point B is (0, sqrt(3)/2). The slope of AB is (sqrt(3)/2 - 0)/(0 - 1/2) = (sqrt(3)/2)/(-1/2) = -sqrt(3). So the equation of AB is y - 0 = -sqrt(3)(x - 1/2). So y = -sqrt(3)x + (sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, any point C on AB can be written as (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2) where t ranges from 0 to 1/2. Wait, actually, when t is 0, that's point B, and when t is 1/2, that's point A. Since we need C distinct from A and B, t is between 0 and 1/2, excluding the endpoints. \n\nNow, the key is that C is not on any segment PQ from F except AB. So suppose that C is on some segment PQ from F. Then, that segment PQ would have to pass through C, but since C is on AB, that would mean that PQ and AB intersect at point C. However, the problem states that C is only on AB and no other segment from F. Therefore, for point C, there should be no other segment PQ in F (other than AB itself) that passes through C. \n\nTherefore, to find C, we need to find a point on AB such that it is not on any other segment from F except AB. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps C is the point where AB is tangent to some segment from F? Hmm, maybe. Let me think differently. \n\nSuppose that a segment PQ from F passes through C. Then, since PQ is a segment from the x-axis to the y-axis of unit length, its endpoints are (p,0) and (0,q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1. The line PQ can be parametrized as (p - pt, qt) where t goes from 0 to 1. Wait, actually, parametric equations for PQ: starting at (p,0) and moving to (0,q). The parametric equations can be written as x = p(1 - t), y = qt, where t \u2208 [0,1]. \n\nAlternatively, the equation of the line PQ can be written as (x/p) + (y/q) = 1, since intercept form. \n\nSo the line PQ is x/p + y/q = 1. \n\nSo for point C to lie on PQ, it must satisfy x_C / p + y_C / q = 1. \n\nBut since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1, we can express this equation in terms of p and q. \n\nGiven that C is on AB, its coordinates (x,y) satisfy y = -sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nTherefore, substituting into the equation of PQ: \n\nx/p + [ (-sqrt(3)x + sqrt(3)/2 ) / q ] = 1. \n\nWe can rearrange this equation for x: \n\nx/p + (-sqrt(3)x)/q + (sqrt(3)/(2q)) = 1 \n\nGrouping the terms with x: \n\nx (1/p - sqrt(3)/q ) + sqrt(3)/(2q) = 1 \n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nx*( ( q - sqrt(3) p ) / (p q) ) + sqrt(3)/(2 q) = 1 \n\nHmm, perhaps another approach. Let me think of this as an equation in variables p and q. Since for the point C to lie on PQ, there must exist some p and q (with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1) such that the above equation holds. \n\nTherefore, for the point C to not lie on any PQ except AB, the only solution (p, q) to the equation must be the one corresponding to AB. \n\nWait, so AB is also a member of the family F? Let's check: AB has endpoints A (1/2,0) and B (0, sqrt(3)/2). The length of AB is sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (sqrt(3)/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. So yes, AB is indeed a member of F. \n\nTherefore, for point C on AB, which is part of AB, we want that the only segment in F that contains C is AB itself. So for any other segment PQ in F (other than AB), C is not on PQ. \n\nTherefore, we need to find a point C on AB (other than A and B) such that there does not exist any (p, q) with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, (p, q) \u2260 (1/2, sqrt(3)/2), such that the line PQ passes through C. \n\nSo, equivalently, the system of equations:\n\n1. p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\n2. x_C / p + y_C / q =1,\n\nmust have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, the equations must have only that solution. So, for the point C, the equations must be such that this is the only solution. \n\nTherefore, to find such a point C, perhaps we can set up the equations and find conditions on x_C and y_C so that the system has only that solution. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can think of the envelope of all these segments PQ. The envelope is a curve tangent to all these segments, and the point C might be where AB is tangent to the envelope? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the point C is where the line AB is tangent to some envelope curve formed by the family F. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps parametrizing the problem. Let me try this step by step. \n\nLet me suppose that point C is (t, -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2). Let me denote coordinates as (x, y) = (t, y(t)) where y(t) = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nWe need to ensure that the only segment PQ in F passing through C is AB itself. \n\nSo, for any other segment PQ (other than AB), the line PQ does not pass through C. \n\nTherefore, for the point C, the system of equations:\n\nx/p + y/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nmust have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, substituting x and y in terms of t, since x = t and y = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2,\n\nthen the equation becomes:\n\nt/p + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1,\n\nalong with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need this system to have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, the equations must be such that when we solve them, the only solution is p=1/2, q= sqrt(3)/2. \n\nTherefore, let's write the first equation as:\n\nt/p + ( sqrt(3)/2 (1 - 2t) ) / q =1. \n\nWait, let me compute the numerator of the second term:\n\n-sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t = sqrt(3)(1/2 - t). \n\nSo the equation is:\n\nt/p + ( sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ) / q =1.\n\nTherefore, the equation is:\n\n(t)/p + ( sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ) / q =1,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe need this system to have only the solution (p, q)=(1/2, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, let's consider this as a system in variables p and q, with t being a parameter (since we are looking for a specific t where this system has only that solution). \n\nLet me consider this as an equation in p and q. Let me rearrange the first equation:\n\nt/p + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t)/q =1.\n\nLet me denote sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) as some constant, say K. Then the equation is t/p + K/q =1. But maybe it's better to think of this as a linear equation in 1/p and 1/q. \n\nAlternatively, let me set variables u =1/p and v =1/q. Then the equation becomes t u + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) v =1. \n\nBut then we also have p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, which in terms of u and v is 1/u\u00b2 +1/v\u00b2 =1. Hmm, that might complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can write the first equation as t q + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p = pq,\n\nsince multiplying both sides by pq:\n\nt q + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p = pq.\n\nThen rearranged:\n\npq - t q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p =0.\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me think of this as a quadratic in p and q. Since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1, perhaps we can substitute q from the first equation into the second equation. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the first equation:\n\nt/p + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t)/q =1,\n\nand the second equation p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nWe can try to solve this system for p and q. Let me see if we can express one variable in terms of the other. \n\nLet me denote equation 1 as:\n\nt/p =1 - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t)/q,\n\nthen,\n\nt/p = [ q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ] / q,\n\nso cross multiplying,\n\nt q = p [ q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ]\n\n=> t q = p q - p sqrt(3)(1/2 - t)\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt q - p q + p sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) =0\n\nFactor terms:\n\nq(t - p) + p sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) =0\n\nHmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe another approach. Let me try to consider the equations as follows.\n\nLet me set variables p and q, with p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. \n\nThe point (p,0) to (0,q) must pass through (t, y(t)), where y(t) = -sqrt(3)t + sqrt(3)/2.\n\nThe line equation is x/p + y/q =1. So substituting x = t, y = y(t):\n\nt/p + y(t)/q =1.\n\nWe need this equation to have only one solution (p, q) = (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). \n\nTherefore, the system:\n\nt/p + y(t)/q =1,\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nmust have exactly one solution. \n\nSo, for this to have only one solution, the equations must be such that when we solve them, there is only one pair (p, q). \n\nTherefore, substituting y(t) into the first equation, we can write this as an equation in p and q. Let me see if we can write this as a quadratic equation and set its discriminant to zero so that there is only one solution. \n\nLet me try to express one variable in terms of the other. Let me solve the first equation for q in terms of p. \n\nStarting with t/p + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] / q =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by p q to eliminate denominators:\n\nt q + [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] p = p q.\n\nRearranged:\n\np q - t q - [ -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ] p =0.\n\nWait, let's see again:\n\nStarting over:\n\nt/p + [ sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ] / q =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by p q:\n\nt q + sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p = p q,\n\nBring all terms to left-hand side:\n\np q - t q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t)p =0.\n\nFactor terms with p and q:\n\nq(p - t) - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p =0.\n\nHmm, not sure. Let me rearrange terms:\n\np q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) p = t q,\n\nFactor p:\n\np [ q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ] = t q,\n\nThen,\n\np = [ t q ] / [ q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) ]\n\nNow, substitute this into the second equation p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1:\n\n[ (t q)^2 / ( q - sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) )^2 ) ] + q\u00b2 =1.\n\nThis seems complicated, but perhaps manageable. Let me denote D = sqrt(3)(1/2 - t) for simplicity. Then,\n\np = (t q)/(q - D),\n\nso substituting into p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\n(t\u00b2 q\u00b2)/(q - D)^2 + q\u00b2 =1,\n\nMultiply through by (q - D)^2 to eliminate denominator:\n\nt\u00b2 q\u00b2 + q\u00b2 (q - D)^2 = (q - D)^2,\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt\u00b2 q\u00b2 + q\u00b2 (q - D)^2 - (q - D)^2 =0,\n\nFactor (q - D)^2 from last two terms:\n\nt\u00b2 q\u00b2 + (q - D)^2 ( q\u00b2 -1 ) =0,\n\nHmm, perhaps another substitution. Let me think of variable q here. Let me denote variable q, and write equation in terms of q. \n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to write everything in terms of q and then set the equation to have a double root. Since we want only one solution, the equation must have discriminant zero. \n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider this as a quadratic equation in q. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps parametrize using an angle. Since p and q are on the unit circle, we can set p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, since p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =1. \n\nWait, that's a good idea! Let me try that. \n\nLet me set p = cos\u03b8 and q = sin\u03b8, where \u03b8 is between 0 and \u03c0/2 (since p and q are positive in the first quadrant). \n\nThen, the equation of the line PQ is x/cos\u03b8 + y/sin\u03b8 =1. \n\nThe point C(t, y(t)) must lie on this line, so:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + y(t)/ sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nBut y(t) = -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nTherefore,\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + ( -sqrt(3) t + sqrt(3)/2 ) / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) / sin\u03b8 =1.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nt (1/cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/sin\u03b8 ) + sqrt(3)/(2 sin\u03b8) =1.\n\nHmm, so this equation must hold for some \u03b8, but we want that the only \u03b8 for which this holds is the \u03b8 corresponding to AB. \n\nThe segment AB corresponds to p =1/2 and q = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, cos\u03b8 =1/2, so \u03b8 = \u03c0/3, and sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2. \n\nSo, for the point C, the equation above must have \u03b8 = \u03c0/3 as its only solution. Therefore, the equation in \u03b8 must have only \u03b8= \u03c0/3 as a solution. \n\nTherefore, we can consider the equation:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) / sin\u03b8 =1,\n\nand we want this to be true only when \u03b8= \u03c0/3. \n\nTherefore, the equation must be an identity only at \u03b8= \u03c0/3, and no other \u03b8 in [0, \u03c0/2]. \n\nAlternatively, rearrange the equation to set it to zero:\n\nt / cos\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) / sin\u03b8 -1 =0.\n\nLet me combine terms over a common denominator. Let me write everything over sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8:\n\n[ t sin\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 ] / ( sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nTherefore, numerator must be zero:\n\nt sin\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\nt sin\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3) t cos\u03b8 ) - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nGroup terms with t:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nLet me factor cos\u03b8 in the second term:\n\n= t ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nLet me see if this can be written as a multiple of (\u03b8 - \u03c0/3). Since \u03b8=\u03c0/3 is a solution, perhaps we can write it as (\u03b8 - \u03c0/3) times something. \n\nAlternatively, let me plug in \u03b8=\u03c0/3 to check:\n\nAt \u03b8=\u03c0/3,\n\nsin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2,\n\ncos\u03b8 = 1/2,\n\nSo substituting:\n\nt ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)*(1/2) ) + (1/2)( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.\n\nIndeed, first term inside the t is sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 =0, and the second term is (1/2)(0)=0. So 0 +0=0, which holds. So \u03b8=\u03c0/3 is a solution, as expected. \n\nWe need this equation to have no other solutions. Therefore, the equation must be satisfied only when \u03b8=\u03c0/3. \n\nTo ensure that, the equation must have a double root at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, so that it only touches the axis there. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the equation can be written as a quadratic in some trigonometric function, and discriminant must be zero. Let me see. \n\nAlternatively, let me consider the equation:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nLet me rearrange terms:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) = - cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 )\n\nLet me write this as:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) = cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nHmm, perhaps factor sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8?\n\nAlternatively, let me divide both sides by (sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ), but only if it's not zero. But at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)*(1/2)=0. So that's exactly the point where the denominator is zero. Hmm, tricky.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of tan\u03b8. Let me set \u03c6 = \u03b8, and let me denote tan\u03b8 = t. Wait, but t is already used for the coordinate. Let me use another variable. Let me let k = tan\u03b8, so sin\u03b8 = k / sqrt(1 +k\u00b2), cos\u03b8 =1 / sqrt(1 +k\u00b2). Maybe this substitution can help. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps let me consider the equation as a linear equation in sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8. Let me see:\n\nLooking at the equation:\n\nt sin\u03b8 - t sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 + (sqrt(3)/2) cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nWait, expanding again:\n\nOriginal equation after expanding was:\n\nt sin\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 - sqrt(3) t cos\u03b8 ) - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nSo grouping terms:\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t - sin\u03b8 ) =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, collect terms in sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3) t ) - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nWait, perhaps this is getting too convoluted. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose that the equation in \u03b8 has only \u03b8=\u03c0/3 as solution. So, when we consider the equation:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) =0,\n\nthis must hold only when \u03b8=\u03c0/3. \n\nLet me rearrange the equation as:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) = - cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 )\n\nLet me factor out terms:\n\nLeft side: t ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 )\n\nRight side: -cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) = cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nTherefore, equation becomes:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) = cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 )\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\nt ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) - cos\u03b8 ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.\n\nFactor terms:\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) + (- sqrt(3) t cos\u03b8 - (- sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 )) =0\n\nWait, perhaps expanding:\n\n= t sin\u03b8 - t sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 - cos\u03b8 sin\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 ) cos\u03b8 =0.\n\nGroup terms with sin\u03b8 and cos\u03b8:\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( - t sqrt(3) + sqrt(3)/2 ) =0.\n\nHmm, so:\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) + sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ( - t + 1/2 ) =0.\n\nLet me factor sqrt(3):\n\nsin\u03b8 ( t - cos\u03b8 ) - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ( t - 1/2 ) =0.\n\nHmm, perhaps this can be written as a multiple of some function. Let me see if I can write this as a single sine or cosine function. \n\nAlternatively, let me think of this as an equation that must hold only when \u03b8=\u03c0/3. To ensure uniqueness, the equation must be satisfied only at that angle, so perhaps the equation can be written as a function that has a double root there. \n\nAlternatively, consider this as an equation in \u03b8, and set the derivative at \u03b8=\u03c0/3 to zero so that it's a double root. \n\nLet me denote the left-hand side of the equation as F(\u03b8):\n\nF(\u03b8) = t ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 )\n\nWe want F(\u03b8)=0 only at \u03b8=\u03c0/3. To ensure this, F(\u03b8) must have a double root at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, so that F(\u03b8)= (\u03b8 - \u03c0/3)^2 * ... but since it's a transcendental equation, maybe another approach. \n\nAlternatively, if we consider F(\u03b8)=0 has a double root at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, then F(\u03c0/3)=0 and F\u2019(\u03c0/3)=0. \n\nLet me compute F\u2019(\u03b8):\n\nFirst, F(\u03b8)= t sin\u03b8 - t sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 + ( sqrt(3)/2 cos\u03b8 - sin\u03b8 cos\u03b8 )\n\nWait, perhaps better to compute derivative directly from F(\u03b8)= t ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 )\n\nCompute derivative F\u2019(\u03b8):\n\n= t ( cos\u03b8 + sqrt(3) sin\u03b8 ) + [ -sin\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( -cos\u03b8 ) ]\n\nLet me compute term by term:\n\nFirst term: derivative of t ( sin\u03b8 - sqrt(3) cos\u03b8 ) is t ( cos\u03b8 + sqrt(3) sin\u03b8 )\n\nSecond term: derivative of cos\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ):\n\nUse product rule: -sin\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) + cos\u03b8 ( -cos\u03b8 )\n\nSo altogether:\n\nF\u2019(\u03b8) = t ( cos\u03b8 + sqrt(3) sin\u03b8 ) - sin\u03b8 ( sqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 ) - cos\u00b2\u03b8.\n\nNow, at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, we need both F(\u03b8)=0 and F\u2019(\u03b8)=0.\n\nWe already know F(\u03c0/3)=0. Let's compute F\u2019(\u03c0/3):\n\nFirst, compute each part at \u03b8=\u03c0/3:\n\ncos(\u03c0/3)=1/2, sin(\u03c0/3)=sqrt(3)/2,\n\ncos\u00b2\u03b8 = 1/4,\n\nsqrt(3)/2 - sin\u03b8 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/2 =0,\n\nSo let's plug in:\n\nFirst term: t ( (1/2) + sqrt(3)*(sqrt(3)/2) ) = t (1/2 + 3/2 ) = t*(2) = 2t.\n\nSecond term: - sin\u03b8*(0) =0,\n\nThird term: -cos\u00b2\u03b8 = -1/4.\n\nThus, F\u2019(\u03c0/3) = 2t -1/4.\n\nTo have F\u2019(\u03c0/3)=0, set 2t -1/4=0 \u21d2 t=1/8.\n\nSo, if we set t=1/8, then \u03b8=\u03c0/3 is a double root, so the equation F(\u03b8)=0 would have only that solution (since the function touches zero there and doesn't cross). \n\nTherefore, the point C is at t=1/8 on AB. \n\nTherefore, coordinates of C are:\n\nx = t =1/8,\n\ny= -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2 = sqrt(3)/2 - sqrt(3)/8 = (4 sqrt(3)/8 - sqrt(3)/8 ) = 3 sqrt(3)/8.\n\nTherefore, coordinates (1/8, 3 sqrt(3)/8).\n\nTherefore, OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (1 + 27)/64 = 28/64 = 7/16.\n\nWait, 1 squared is 1, (3 sqrt(3))\u00b2 is 9*3=27. So 1 +27=28, over 8\u00b2=64. 28/64 reduces to 7/16. \n\nTherefore OC\u00b2 =7/16, so p=7, q=16, which are coprime. Thus, p+q=23. \n\nWait, but let me check my steps again because I might have made a mistake.\n\nWait, first, when I set t=1/8, that is the x-coordinate of point C. Then the y-coordinate:\n\ny(t) = -sqrt(3)*(1/8) + sqrt(3)/2. \n\nCalculating:\n\nsqrt(3)/2 is 4 sqrt(3)/8, so subtracting sqrt(3)/8 gives 3 sqrt(3)/8. That's correct.\n\nThen OC squared is (1/8)^2 + (3 sqrt(3)/8)^2 = (1 + 27)/64 =28/64=7/16. \n\nYes, 7 and 16 are coprime, so 7+16=23. \n\nBut let me confirm that this is indeed the correct point. \n\nWait, when we set F\u2019(\u03c0/3)=0, we found t=1/8. That gives us the point where the equation has a double root, so that it only intersects at \u03b8=\u03c0/3, which is AB. \n\nTherefore, this should be the unique point C. \n\nAlternatively, let me check with another approach. Suppose that C is (1/8, 3\u221a3/8). Let me see if any other PQ segment passes through this point. \n\nSuppose there is another segment PQ with endpoints (p,0) and (0,q), p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1, such that the line x/p + y/q=1 passes through (1/8, 3\u221a3/8). \n\nSubstituting into the equation:\n\n(1/8)/p + (3\u221a3/8)/q =1,\n\nMultiply both sides by 8:\n\n1/p + 3\u221a3/q =8,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nSuppose that (p, q) is not (1/2, sqrt(3)/2). Let me see if there are other solutions. \n\nLet me suppose that p=1/2, then q must be sqrt(3)/2, which is the AB case. Let me see if there's another solution. \n\nLet me try to solve the equations:\n\n1/p + 3\u221a3/q =8,\n\nand p\u00b2 + q\u00b2=1.\n\nLet me denote variables p and q. Let me express q from the first equation:\n\n1/p + 3\u221a3/q =8 \u21d2 3\u221a3/q =8 -1/p \u21d2 q= 3\u221a3/(8 -1/p).\n\nBut this might be messy. Let me set variables. Let me let p = cos\u03b8, q=sin\u03b8 as before. Then the equation becomes:\n\n1/cos\u03b8 + 3\u221a3 / sin\u03b8 =8,\n\nand cos\u00b2\u03b8 + sin\u00b2\u03b8=1.\n\nLet me denote this equation:\n\nsec\u03b8 + 3\u221a3 csc\u03b8 =8.\n\nWe can write this as:\n\n1/cos\u03b8 + 3\u221a3 / sin\u03b8 =8.\n\nLet me set this as an equation in \u03b8 and see if there are solutions other than \u03b8=\u03c0/3. \n\nAt \u03b8=\u03c0/3,\n\ncos\u03b8=1/2, sin\u03b8=\u221a3/2,\n\nso 1/(1/2) + 3\u221a3/(\u221a3/2)= 2 + 3\u221a3 * 2/\u221a3 =2 +6=8. So that works. \n\nSuppose another angle, say \u03b8=\u03c0/6,\n\ncos\u03b8=\u221a3/2, sin\u03b8=1/2,\n\nthen 1/(\u221a3/2) + 3\u221a3/(1/2)= 2/\u221a3 + 6\u221a3 \u2248 1.1547 + 10.392 \u224811.546>8. So too big. \n\nWhat about \u03b8=\u03c0/2,\n\ncos\u03b8=0, which would make 1/cos\u03b8 undefined, so no.\n\n\u03b8 approaching 0: 1/cos\u03b8 approaches 1, 3\u221a3 / sin\u03b8 approaches infinity, so equation not satisfied. \n\nWhat about \u03b8=\u03c0/4,\n\ncos\u03b8=sin\u03b8=\u221a2/2,\n\nthen 1/(\u221a2/2) + 3\u221a3/(\u221a2/2)= 2/\u221a2 + 3\u221a3*2/\u221a2 \u22481.414 + 4.242*3\u2248 1.414 + 12.727\u224814.14>8.\n\nHmm. What about \u03b8=\u03c0/3 + some small angle? Let me check \u03b8=\u03c0/3 + \u03b5,\n\nSuppose \u03b8=\u03c0/3 + \u03b5, where \u03b5 is small. Let's see if there could be another solution near \u03c0/3.\n\nBut since at \u03b8=\u03c0/3 the derivative F\u2019(\u03b8)=0, so the function F(\u03b8)=0 has a double root there, so there are no other roots nearby. Thus, the only solution is \u03b8=\u03c0/3, so that would confirm that there is no other segment PQ through C except AB. \n\nTherefore, the point C is indeed (1/8, 3\u221a3/8) and OC\u00b2=7/16, so the answer is 7+16=23. \n\nI think that's solid. Let me check once more the OC squared:\n\nx-coordinate 1/8, y-coordinate 3\u221a3/8,\n\nso squared distance is (1/8)^2 + (3\u221a3 /8)^2 =1/64 + 27/64 =28/64=7/16. Yep. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 23.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{23}\n\n\nGiven points \\( O(0,0) \\), \\( A\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 0\\right) \\), and \\( B\\left(0, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\), we need to find a unique point \\( C \\) on segment \\( \\overline{AB} \\) that does not belong to any segment from the family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) except \\( \\overline{AB} \\). The family \\( \\mathcal{F} \\) consists of segments \\( \\overline{PQ} \\) of unit length with \\( P \\) on the \\( x \\)-axis and \\( Q \\) on the \\( y \\)-axis.\n\n1. **Equation of Line \\( AB \\)**:\n   - The line \\( AB \\) has a slope of \\( -\\sqrt{3} \\).\n   - Equation: \\( y = -\\sqrt{3}x + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\).\n\n2. **Parametrization of Point \\( C \\)**:\n   - Point \\( C \\) on \\( AB \\) can be written as \\( \\left(t, -\\sqrt{3}t + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) \\).\n\n3. **Condition for Point \\( C \\)**:\n   - For \\( C \\) to lie on a segment \\( \\overline{PQ} \\in \\mathcal{F} \\), the line \\( x/p + y/q = 1 \\) must pass through \\( C \\), where \\( p^2 + q^2 = 1 \\).\n   - Substituting \\( C \\)'s coordinates into the line equation: \\( \\frac{t}{p} + \\frac{-\\sqrt{3}t + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{q} = 1 \\).\n\n4. **Solving for \\( t \\)**:\n   - Using trigonometric parameterization \\( p = \\cos\\theta \\) and \\( q = \\sin\\theta \\), we derive the equation:\n     \\[\n     t \\sin\\theta - t \\sqrt{3} \\cos\\theta + \\cos\\theta \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} - \\sin\\theta\\right) = 0\n     \\]\n   - Ensuring this equation has only one solution \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\), we set the derivative at \\( \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\) to zero, leading to \\( t = \\frac{1}{8} \\).\n\n5. **Coordinates of \\( C \\)**:\n   - Substituting \\( t = \\frac{1}{8} \\) into the line equation for \\( AB \\):\n     \\[\n     C\\left(\\frac{1}{8}, \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)\n     \\]\n\n6. **Calculating \\( OC^2 \\)**:\n   - Distance squared from \\( O \\) to \\( C \\):\n     \\[\n     OC^2 = \\left(\\frac{1}{8}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{8}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{64} + \\frac{27}{64} = \\frac{28}{64} = \\frac{7}{16}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, \\( p = 7 \\) and \\( q = 16 \\), giving \\( p + q = 23 \\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{23}\\).",
