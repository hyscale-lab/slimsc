      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, with their diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses. A rhombus has diagonals that are perpendicular bisectors of each other, and they intersect at the midpoint. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, but maybe I can use coordinates to represent the points?\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of points A, B, C, D such that the diagonals intersect at the origin. Let's suppose that the diagonals are AC and BD. Since the origin is the midpoint, if A is (a, b), then C must be (-a, -b). Similarly, if B is (c, d), then D is (-c, -d). \n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So for point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1, and similarly for point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. The sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Let me see if I can express the lengths of the sides in terms of coordinates. The length of AB would be sqrt[(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2], and similarly for the other sides. Since all sides are equal, this should equal the length of BC, which would be sqrt[(c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2]?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I get the coordinates right. Let me re-clarify the points. Let me think of the rhombus as having vertices A, B, C, D in order, so that the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. The diagonals are AC and BD. So if A is (a, b), then C is (-a, -b), as before, and B is (c, d), D is (-c, -d). Then the sides AB would be from (a, b) to (c, d), BC is from (c, d) to (-a, -b), CD is from (-a, -b) to (-c, -d), and DA is from (-c, -d) to (a, b). \n\nSo the length of AB squared is (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2. The length of BC squared is ( -a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2. Since BC is from (c, d) to (-a, -b), so coordinates difference is (-a - c, -b - d). Squared: ( -a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2. \n\nSimilarly, the length of CD squared is (-c - (-a))^2 + (-d - (-b))^2? Wait, CD is from (-a, -b) to (-c, -d). So the difference is (-c - (-a), -d - (-b)) = (a - c, b - d). So squared length is (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2, same as AB. Similarly DA would be from (-c, -d) to (a, b), so difference (a + c, b + d), squared length (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2, same as BC. \n\nSo all sides squared are either (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 or (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2. Since it's a rhombus, all sides must be equal, so these two expressions must be equal. Therefore:\n\n(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2)\n\nRight side: (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2)\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n[ (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2) ]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\na\u00b2 cancels, c\u00b2 cancels, b\u00b2 cancels, d\u00b2 cancels.\n\nLeft with:\n\n2ac + 2bd - (-2ac -2bd) = 2ac + 2bd + 2ac + 2bd = 4ac +4bd\n\nSet this equal to zero because left side minus right side is zero:\n\nWait, actually, the equation was (left side) = (right side), so right side - left side = 0, so 4ac +4bd =0. So 4(ac + bd)=0 \u21d2 ac + bd =0.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the rhombus is that the coordinates of points A and B satisfy ac + bd =0. \n\nSo, that's a necessary condition.\n\nNow, since A and B lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy:\n\nFor point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nFor point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nAdditionally, ac + bd =0.\n\nOur goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the distance between points B and D. Since D is (-c, -d), so BD is the distance between (c, d) and (-c, -d), which is sqrt[(2c)^2 + (2d)^2], so BD squared is (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 =4c\u00b2 +4d\u00b2. Therefore, BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So we need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi, and then the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum. Wait, but maybe it's the minimal BD\u00b2? Wait, no, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, but since it's asking for the greatest number that is less than all BD\u00b2, so the infimum. So we need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and then the answer is that minimal value? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the greatest real number M such that M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So M is the supremum of all numbers less than all BD\u00b2. That would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because the greatest lower bound is the infimum. So the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi is the answer. Because that's the largest number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. But since we need the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, perhaps it's the infimum. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of infimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some minimal value, but never actually reach it. Then the infimum would be that minimal value, and the answer is that infimum. Alternatively, maybe BD\u00b2 has a minimum, so then the infimum is equal to the minimum, which would be the answer.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2 given the constraints, and that would be the answer.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) given that (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 and ac + bd=0, and (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nHmm, but there are variables a, b, c, d here. We need to find the minimal value of 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) under those constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parameterize the points on the hyperbola. Let me see if I can parameterize points A and B in terms of hyperbola parameters.\n\nThe hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. A standard hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions: x = sqrt(20) cosh t, y = sqrt(24) sinh t. Alternatively, another parametrization might be useful here, but maybe trigonometric for hyperbola? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can set variables such that points are related via some symmetry?\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the rhombus is determined by the points A and B (since C and D are determined by symmetry), perhaps we can consider coordinates such that points A and B are related through some condition.\n\nWait, given that ac + bd =0, that's a key equation. Let me see if I can express variables in terms of others.\n\nSuppose I fix point A as (a,b). Then, the coordinates of point B must satisfy (c, d) such that (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 and ac + bd=0. So given a and b, c and d must satisfy those two equations. Then BD squared is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So perhaps I can write this in terms of a and b?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider vectors. Let me think of vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since the diagonals are AC and BD, the vectors OA and OB are the vectors from the origin to A and B, respectively. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, so the other points are just the negatives. \n\nThe condition ac + bd =0 is equivalent to the dot product of vectors OA and OB being zero. So OA \u00b7 OB =0. So vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. Therefore, the vectors from the origin to points A and B must be perpendicular. \n\nAh! That's an important point. So OA is perpendicular to OB. Since the rhombus has diagonals intersecting at right angles? Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, hold on. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's a property of a rhombus. So that's why OA \u00b7 OB =0, because the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, but in our case, OA and OB are not the diagonals, but the vectors to vertices. Wait, hold on. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the diagonals are AC and BD. The vectors OA and OC are along the diagonal AC, and vectors OB and OD are along BD. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Since AC is from A to C, which is ( -2a, -2b ), and BD is from B to D, which is ( -2c, -2d ). The vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:\n\n(-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 4(ac + bd) =0 \u21d2 ac + bd =0. \n\nAh, that's exactly the condition we had earlier. So indeed, the diagonals are perpendicular, which is a property of a rhombus, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the key equations we have are:\n\n1. For point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n2. For point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n3. ac + bd =0,\n\nand BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). We need to minimize BD\u00b2, so find the minimal value of 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) under these constraints.\n\nHmm. Let me see. Since we have three equations and four variables (a, b, c, d), perhaps we can parameterize variables to reduce the number. Let me consider that since OA and OB are perpendicular vectors, we can perhaps set up coordinates such that OA is along some axis, but since hyperbola is symmetric, maybe we can parameterize points A and B in terms of angles or hyperbola parameters?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that since OA and OB are perpendicular, then (a, b) and (c, d) are perpendicular vectors, so (a, b) \u22c5 (c, d)=0.\n\nLet me think of variables in terms of vectors. Let me denote vector OA = (a, b), vector OB = (c, d). Then OA \u22c5 OB =0, so ac + bd=0. \n\nSo given that OA and OB are perpendicular vectors lying on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So both vectors OA and OB are on the hyperbola, and they are perpendicular. We need to find the minimal value of 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), which is 4 times the squared length of vector OB. Wait, because BD squared is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). Wait, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which is twice the vector from O to B, so BD squared is (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So BD squared is 4 times the squared length of OB. Therefore, minimizing BD squared is equivalent to minimizing the squared length of OB, multiplied by 4. So we can instead minimize |OB|\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, given that (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 and that OA and OB are perpendicular, with OA also lying on the hyperbola.\n\nHmm. Let me see. Maybe we can parametrize point A as (a, b) on the hyperbola, then express point B in terms of a and b such that (c, d) is perpendicular to (a, b) and also lies on the hyperbola. Then, for each such point A, we can find the possible points B, compute |OB|\u00b2, and then find the minimum over all A and B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me consider variables c and d for point B, with the constraint (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1, and the perpendicularity condition ac + bd =0, where (a, b) is also on the hyperbola. But since (a, b) is also variable, this complicates things. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that for vectors OA and OB being perpendicular, lying on the hyperbola, so we can set up the problem as follows:\n\nLet me denote OA = (a, b) and OB = (c, d) such that:\n\n1. (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n2. (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n3. ac + bd =0.\n\nWe need to minimize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2.\n\nLet me think of this as an optimization problem with constraints. Let me consider variables a, b, c, d with these three constraints, and we need to minimize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2. Maybe I can set up Lagrangian multipliers for this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way by using the hyperbola's parametrization.\n\nLet me recall that hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. For the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a standard parametrization is (a cosh\u03b8, b sinh\u03b8). Let me try that here.\n\nLet me set point A as (sqrt(20) cosh\u03b8, sqrt(24) sinh\u03b8). Similarly, point B can be parametrized as (sqrt(20) cosh\u03c6, sqrt(24) sinh\u03c6). Then, the condition that OA and OB are perpendicular is:\n\n[sqrt(20) cosh\u03b8][sqrt(20) cosh\u03c6] + [sqrt(24) sinh\u03b8][sqrt(24) sinh\u03c6] =0,\n\nsince their dot product is zero. Let's compute this:\n\n(20 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6) + (24 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6) =0,\n\nDivide both sides by, say, 4:\n\n5 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 + 6 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0.\n\nHmm, that's an equation relating \u03b8 and \u03c6. Let me see if I can manipulate this equation.\n\nLet me recall some hyperbolic identities. The identity cosh(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 + sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6. So perhaps I can write:\n\n5 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 + 6 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0,\n\nLet me express this as:\n\n5 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 +5 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 + sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0,\n\nSo, 5 (cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 + sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6) + sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0,\n\nWhich is 5 cosh(\u03b8 + \u03c6) + sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0,\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express everything in terms of exponentials?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rearrange the equation:\n\n5 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 = -6 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6,\n\nDivide both sides by cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 (assuming they are non-zero, which they are except at \u03b8 or \u03c6 being zero, but hyperbola points are away from the origin):\n\n5 = -6 (sinh\u03b8 / cosh\u03b8)(sinh\u03c6 / cosh\u03c6),\n\nWhich is:\n\n5 = -6 tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6,\n\nSo,\n\ntanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, that's a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal value of c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, which for point B is (sqrt(20) cosh\u03c6)^2 + (sqrt(24) sinh\u03c6)^2 = 20 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 +24 sinh\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nLet me compute that expression:\n\n20 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 +24 sinh\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, perhaps express this in terms of cosh(2\u03c6) or sinh(2\u03c6). Let me recall that cosh\u00b2\u03c6 = (cosh(2\u03c6) +1)/2, sinh\u00b2\u03c6 = (cosh(2\u03c6) -1)/2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n20*( (cosh2\u03c6 +1)/2 ) +24*( (cosh2\u03c6 -1)/2 )\n\n= [20*(cosh2\u03c6 +1) +24*(cosh2\u03c6 -1)] /2\n\n= [ (20 +24)cosh2\u03c6 + (20 -24) ] /2\n\n= [44 cosh2\u03c6 -4 ] /2\n\n=22 cosh2\u03c6 -2.\n\nTherefore, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 =22 cosh2\u03c6 -2.\n\nSo we need to minimize this expression, given that tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6 = -5/6, where \u03b8 is related to point A, which also lies on the hyperbola. But since point A is arbitrary except for the hyperbola condition, but we have the relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6 via tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6 = -5/6. \n\nTherefore, perhaps we can express \u03b8 in terms of \u03c6, or vice versa, and then express the expression to be minimized in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet me denote t = tanh\u03c6. Then tanh\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 t). However, since tanh\u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, so:\n\n| (-5)/(6 t) | \u22641 \u21d2 |5/(6 t)| \u22641 \u21d2 |t| \u22655/6.\n\nTherefore, |tanh\u03c6| \u22655/6. Since tanh\u03c6 is between -1 and 1, this implies that tanh\u03c6 \u22655/6 or tanh\u03c6 \u2264-5/6.\n\nTherefore, \u03c6 must satisfy |\u03c6| \u2265 arctanh(5/6). \n\nBut let's see, we can write cosh2\u03c6 in terms of tanh\u03c6. Recall that cosh2\u03c6 = (1 + tanh\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - tanh\u00b2\u03c6). Wait, actually:\n\nLet me recall that cosh\u00b2\u03c6 - sinh\u00b2\u03c6 =1,\n\nand tanh\u03c6 = sinh\u03c6 / cosh\u03c6,\n\nso let me compute cosh2\u03c6:\n\ncosh2\u03c6 = 2 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 -1,\n\nand since tanh\u03c6 = t,\n\ncosh\u00b2\u03c6 =1/(1 - t\u00b2),\n\nso cosh2\u03c6 = 2/(1 - t\u00b2) -1 = (2 - (1 - t\u00b2))/(1 - t\u00b2) ) = (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nWait, cosh2\u03c6 = 2 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 -1,\n\nsince cosh\u00b2\u03c6 = (cosh2\u03c6 +1)/2,\n\nso 2 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 -1 = cosh2\u03c6,\n\nYes. So cosh2\u03c6 =2*(1/(1 - t\u00b2)) -1 = (2 - (1 - t\u00b2))/(1 - t\u00b2) )? Wait, no:\n\nWait, cosh\u00b2\u03c6 = 1/(1 - tanh\u00b2\u03c6) = 1/(1 - t\u00b2). Therefore,\n\ncosh2\u03c6 = 2*(1/(1 - t\u00b2)) -1 = 2/(1 - t\u00b2) -1 = (2 - (1 - t\u00b2))/(1 - t\u00b2) ) = (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nYes, so cosh2\u03c6 = (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 =22 * [ (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ] -2,\n\nwhere t = tanh\u03c6, and |t| \u22655/6.\n\nBut we also have the relation tanh\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 t).\n\nLet me see if there are any constraints on t from this. Since tanh\u03b8 must be in (-1,1), so | (-5)/(6 t) | <1. So |5/(6 t)| <1 \u21d2 |t| >5/6, which is already the condition we had. So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the expression to minimize is:\n\n22*( (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ) -2,\n\nwith |t| \u22655/6.\n\nBut we can consider t as a real number with |t| \u22655/6, but since the expression is even in t (since replacing t with -t gives same value), we can consider t \u22655/6 or t \u2264-5/6, but since the expression is even, we can just consider t \u22655/6 and find the minimum there.\n\nTherefore, let me set t = tanh\u03c6 \u22655/6 (since we can take \u03c6 positive without loss of generality). Then, let me denote t as a variable \u22655/6, and find the minimal value of f(t)=22*( (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ) -2.\n\nWait, but let me compute f(t):\n\nf(t) =22*( (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ) -2,\n\nLet me simplify this expression:\n\nFirst, write (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) = -( (1 + t\u00b2)/(t\u00b2 -1) )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rewrite as:\n\nf(t) =22*( (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ) -2 =22*( (1 - t\u00b2 + 2 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ) -2 =22*(1/(1 - t\u00b2) + 2t\u00b2/(1 - t\u00b2)) -2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me write f(t) as:\n\nLet me compute f(t):\n\nLet me write numerator: 22*(1 + t\u00b2) -2*(1 - t\u00b2) all over (1 - t\u00b2):\n\nWait,\n\nWait, f(t) =22*(1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) - 2*(1)/(1) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second term is -2, so actually f(t) = [22*(1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2)] -2.\n\nAlternatively, combine terms over a common denominator:\n\n= [22(1 + t\u00b2) - 2(1 - t\u00b2)] / (1 - t\u00b2)\n\n= [22 + 22t\u00b2 -2 + 2t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2)\n\n= [20 +24 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2)\n\nHmm, so f(t) = (24 t\u00b2 +20)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWait, that's a better expression. Let me check:\n\nYes, 22*(1 + t\u00b2) =22 +22 t\u00b2,\n\nthen subtract 2*(1 - t\u00b2):\n\nWait, no, the -2 is separate. Wait, sorry, original f(t)=22*(1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) -2.\n\nTherefore, to combine over denominator (1 - t\u00b2):\n\nMultiply the second term by (1 - t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2):\n\n= [22(1 + t\u00b2) -2(1 - t\u00b2)] / (1 - t\u00b2)\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nThen numerator is 22(1 + t\u00b2) -2(1 - t\u00b2) =22 +22 t\u00b2 -2 +2 t\u00b2 =20 +24 t\u00b2,\n\nso f(t)= (24 t\u00b2 +20)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the expression to minimize is f(t)= (24 t\u00b2 +20)/(1 - t\u00b2), with t \u22655/6.\n\nWait, but t is tanh\u03c6, which is between -1 and1. Since we are considering t \u22655/6, so t \u2208 [5/6,1). So the domain is t \u2208 [5/6,1).\n\nSo now, we can treat this as a function of t on [5/6, 1) and find its minimum.\n\nLet me compute derivative of f(t) with respect to t:\n\nf(t) = (24t\u00b2 +20)/(1 - t\u00b2)\n\nLet me compute f\u2019(t):\n\nUsing quotient rule,\n\nf\u2019(t)= [ (48t)(1 - t\u00b2) - (24t\u00b2 +20)(-2t) ] / (1 - t\u00b2)^2\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n48t(1 - t\u00b2) +2t(24t\u00b2 +20)\n\n=48t -48 t\u00b3 +48 t\u00b3 +40 t\n\n= (48t +40t) + (-48 t\u00b3 +48 t\u00b3)\n\n=88t.\n\nTherefore, numerator is 88t,\n\nThus, f\u2019(t)=88t / (1 - t\u00b2)^2.\n\nSince t \u22655/6 >0, the derivative is positive. Therefore, f(t) is increasing on [5/6,1). Therefore, the minimal value occurs at the left endpoint, t=5/6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value is f(5/6).\n\nCompute f(5/6):\n\nFirst, t=5/6,\n\nNumerator:24*(25/36) +20 = (24*25)/36 +20 = (600)/36 +20= 50/3 +20 = (50 +60)/3=110/3,\n\nDenominator:1 - (25/36)= (36 -25)/36=11/36,\n\nThus f(5/6)= (110/3)/(11/36)= (110/3)*(36/11)= (10/3)*36= 10*12=120.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 is 120, so BD squared is 4*(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2)=4*120=480.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, if f(t)=c\u00b2 + d\u00b2= (24t\u00b2 +20)/(1 -t\u00b2), so when t=5/6, f(t)=120, so BD squared is 4*120=480. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but can it actually reach 480? Because when t approaches 5/6 from above, the minimal value is achieved at t=5/6. But is t=5/6 allowed?\n\nWait, let's check when t=5/6. Since t = tanh\u03c6, so tanh\u03c6=5/6. That is possible because tanh\u03c6 can take any value in (-1,1). So tanh\u03c6=5/6 is achievable. Then, with t=5/6, we can find the corresponding \u03b8 such that tanh\u03b8 = (-5)/(6t)= (-5)/(6*(5/6))= -1.\n\nWait, tanh\u03b8 = -1. But tanh\u03b8 = -1 would require \u03b8 approaching negative infinity, since tanh approaches -1 as \u03b8\u2192-infty. Wait, but tanh\u03b8 can't actually be -1, since it's a limit. Hmm, so here arises a problem. Because tanh\u03b8 =-1 is not achievable, so the minimal value is approached as \u03b8 approaches -infty, but never actually reaches it. Therefore, perhaps the minimal value is not achieved, but approached as t approaches 5/6 from above?\n\nWait, let's see. If t approaches 5/6 from above, then tanh\u03c6 approaches 5/6 from above? Wait, no. Wait, t is tanh\u03c6, so if we set t approaching 5/6 from above, that would require \u03c6 approaching arctanh(5/6) from above, but tanh\u03c6 can't exceed 1, but 5/6 is less than 1. Wait, but if t is approaching 5/6 from above, that would require t to be just over 5/6, but actually tanh\u03c6 can reach exactly 5/6. Wait, tanh\u03c6=5/6 is possible for finite \u03c6. Because arctanh(5/6) is a finite number. Let me compute arctanh(5/6). Since arctanh(x)=0.5*ln((1+x)/(1-x)). So plugging x=5/6:\n\n0.5*ln( (1 +5/6)/(1 -5/6) )=0.5*ln( (11/6)/(1/6) )=0.5*ln(11)=approx 0.5*2.397\u22481.198. So \u03c6 can be that value. Therefore, tanh\u03c6=5/6 is achievable. Therefore, then tanh\u03b8= -5/(6*(5/6))= -1. But tanh\u03b8=-1 is not achievable, but tanh\u03b8 approaches -1 as \u03b8 approaches -infty. Therefore, for \u03b8 to satisfy tanh\u03b8= -1, it would require \u03b8=-infty, which is not a real number. Therefore, this suggests that when t=5/6, the corresponding \u03b8 is not a real number. Therefore, there is inconsistency here.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my parametrization has an issue here. Let me check again.\n\nWe had tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6 = -5/6,\n\nIf t = tanh\u03c6 =5/6,\n\nthen tanh\u03b8 = (-5/6)/t = (-5/6)/(5/6)= -1,\n\nSo tanh\u03b8= -1, but that's only possible as \u03b8 approaches -infty. Therefore, in reality, we can't have \u03b8 finite with tanh\u03b8=-1. Therefore, the minimal value at t=5/6 is not achievable because it would require an infinite \u03b8, which is not on the hyperbola. Therefore, the minimal value is approached as \u03b8 approaches -infty and \u03c6 approaches arctanh(5/6). Therefore, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. Hence, the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. Wait, but since BD\u00b2 can approach 480 but never actually be less than that, so 480 is the infimum. Therefore, the answer should be 480.\n\nWait, but let me verify this again. Suppose we take \u03b8 approaching -infty, so point A approaches the \"left\" vertex of the hyperbola? Wait, hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 has vertices at (\u00b1sqrt(20),0). So as \u03b8 approaches -infty, the point A would be (sqrt(20) cosh\u03b8, sqrt(24) sinh\u03b8). As \u03b8\u2192-infty, cosh\u03b8 ~ e^{-\u03b8}/2, sinh\u03b8 ~ -e^{-\u03b8}/2. Wait, but cosh\u03b8 is always positive, and sinh\u03b8 approaches -infty. So the coordinates of A would be (sqrt(20)* (e^{-\u03b8}/2), sqrt(24)* (-e^{-\u03b8}/2) ). So as \u03b8\u2192-infty, e^{-\u03b8}\u2192+infty, so the coordinates go to infinity, but in the direction of (sqrt(20), -sqrt(24)) scaled by e^{-\u03b8}. Hmm, so point A is going off to infinity in that direction. \n\nMeanwhile, point B is at tanh\u03c6=5/6, so \u03c6=arctanh(5/6). Then coordinates of B are (sqrt(20) cosh\u03c6, sqrt(24) sinh\u03c6). Let me compute that. Let me compute cosh\u03c6 and sinh\u03c6 when tanh\u03c6=5/6.\n\nSince tanh\u03c6=5/6, then sinh\u03c6= (5/6)/sqrt(1 - (25/36))= (5/6)/sqrt(11/36)= (5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6)=5/sqrt(11).\n\nSimilarly, cosh\u03c6=1/sqrt(1 - (25/36))=1/sqrt(11/36)=6/sqrt(11).\n\nTherefore,\n\nc= sqrt(20)* (6/sqrt(11)),\n\nd= sqrt(24)*(5/sqrt(11)),\n\nSo c\u00b2 +d\u00b2=20*(36/11) +24*(25/11)= (720 +600)/11=1320/11=120,\n\nSo BD squared is 4*120=480. But this requires point A to be at \u03b8 where tanh\u03b8=-1, which is at infinity. Therefore, in the limit as \u03b8 approaches -infty, the point A goes to infinity, but point B is fixed at finite coordinates. However, does the rhombus still hold?\n\nWait, if point A is at infinity, then the rhombus would have one vertex at infinity, which might not be considered a valid rhombus? The problem says \"points on the hyperbola\", so maybe they have to be finite points. Therefore, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is greater than 480, approaching it but never reaching. Therefore, the infimum is 480, so the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where BD\u00b2 can be smaller? Wait, but according to the calculation, the minimal possible c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 is 120, so BD squared is 480, but it's only achieved in the limit. Since the problem says \"for all such rhombi\", and if the rhombus must have all four vertices on the hyperbola, then perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is indeed 480, but since it's not achieved, the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming the parametrization? Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose instead of hyperbola parametrization, I use coordinates.\n\nLet me consider points A(a,b) and B(c,d) with OA perpendicular to OB. So ac + bd=0.\n\nThey lie on the hyperbola: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1 and c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of 4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nLet me consider the expression to minimize: 4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nSubject to c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nand ac + bd=0,\n\nand a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nPerhaps I can express a and b in terms of c and d from the perpendicularity condition. From ac + bd=0, we can write a= - (bd)/c, assuming c \u22600. Substitute into the equation for point A:\n\n[ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/c\u00b2 ] /20 - b\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nHmm, this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Lagrange multipliers with variables a,b,c,d.\n\nWe need to minimize f(c,d) =4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2),\n\nwith constraints:\n\n1. g(c,d)= c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24 -1 =0,\n\n2. h(a,b,c,d)= ac + bd =0,\n\n3. k(a,b)=a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24 -1=0.\n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem with four variables and three constraints. Maybe set up Lagrangian:\n\nL =4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2) + \u03bb(c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24 -1) + \u03bc(ac + bd) + \u03bd(a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24 -1).\n\nThen take partial derivatives with respect to a,b,c,d and set to zero.\n\nCompute partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202a = \u03bc + 2\u03bd a /20 = \u03bc + (\u03bd a)/10 =0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202b = \u03bc d + (-2\u03bd b)/24 = \u03bc d - (\u03bd b)/12 =0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202c =8c + (2\u03bb c)/20 + \u03bc a =8c + (\u03bb c)/10 + \u03bc a =0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202d =8d + (-2\u03bb d)/24 + \u03bc b =8d - (\u03bb d)/12 + \u03bc b =0,\n\nAlso, the constraints:\n\nac + bd =0,\n\na\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nc\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nThis system of equations may be complex, but perhaps we can find a relation between variables.\n\nFrom the first equation (partial w.r. to a):\n\n\u03bc + (\u03bd a)/10 =0 \u21d2 \u03bc = - (\u03bd a)/10.\n\nFrom the second equation (partial w.r. to b):\n\n\u03bc d - (\u03bd b)/12 =0 \u21d2 \u03bc d = (\u03bd b)/12.\n\nSubstitute \u03bc from first equation into second:\n\n- (\u03bd a)/10 *d = (\u03bd b)/12 \u21d2 - (a d)/10 = b /12 \u21d2 - (12 a d) =10 b \u21d2 b = - (6/5) a d.\n\nEquation (1): b = - (6/5) a d.\n\nFrom the third equation (partial w.r. to c):\n\n8c + (\u03bb c)/10 + \u03bc a =0.\n\nSubstitute \u03bc = - (\u03bd a)/10:\n\n8c + (\u03bb c)/10 - (\u03bd a^2)/10 =0.\n\nSimilarly, fourth equation (partial w.r. to d):\n\n8d - (\u03bb d)/12 + \u03bc b =0.\n\nSubstitute \u03bc = - (\u03bd a)/10 and b= -6/5 a d:\n\n8d - (\u03bb d)/12 + (- \u03bd a /10)(-6/5 a d) =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n8d - (\u03bb d)/12 + (6 \u03bd a\u00b2 d)/50 =0,\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can find ratios between variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables a and c, b and d related through the perpendicularity condition.\n\nSuppose we let\u2019s consider vectors OA and OB perpendicular. Let me assume that OA is (a,b), OB is (c,d). Then their dot product is zero: ac + bd =0.\n\nLet me consider that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular, so they form an orthogonal pair on the hyperbola. \n\nSuppose we write OA as (a,b), then OB must satisfy ac + bd=0. Let me parametrize OA as (a,b) on the hyperbola, then OB is a vector perpendicular to OA, lying on the hyperbola. \n\nLet me consider that for any point A on the hyperbola, there might be points B such that OB is perpendicular to OA and also lies on the hyperbola. The minimal BD squared would correspond to the minimal |OB|\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of the director circle or something similar for hyperbola, but hyperbola's director circle is a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the minimal value of |OB|\u00b2 given that OB is perpendicular to OA and both lie on the hyperbola. \n\nAlternatively, since we have two equations:\n\na\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nc\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nand ac + bd=0,\n\nWe can try to express variables in terms of a and b.\n\nFrom ac + bd=0 \u21d2 c = - (b d)/a,\n\nAssuming a \u22600,\n\nSubstitute into the second hyperbola equation:\n\n[ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ] /20 - d\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nMultiply through by 20*24*a\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24*(b\u00b2 d\u00b2) -20*24*a\u00b2*d\u00b2/(24) =20*24*a\u00b2*1,\n\nWait, maybe better to rearrange the equation:\n\n(c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nWith c= - (b d)/a,\n\nSo,\n\n[ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ] /20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nFactor d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 [ (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) -1/24 ] =1,\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nd\u00b2 [ (3 b\u00b2 -5 a\u00b2 ) / (120 a\u00b2) ) ] =1,\n\nWait, let me compute the terms:\n\nLet me compute the coefficient:\n\n(b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) -1/24 = (b\u00b2 * 24 - 20 a\u00b2)/ (20*24 a\u00b2) )= (24 b\u00b2 -20 a\u00b2)/ (480 a\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2*(24 b\u00b2 -20 a\u00b2)/(480 a\u00b2)=1,\n\nThus,\n\nd\u00b2 = 480 a\u00b2 / (24 b\u00b2 -20 a\u00b2).\n\nHmm, so d\u00b2 must be positive, so denominator must have same sign as numerator. Since 480 a\u00b2 is positive, denominator must be positive: 24 b\u00b2 -20 a\u00b2 >0 \u21d2 24 b\u00b2 >20 a\u00b2 \u21d2 (b\u00b2/a\u00b2) >20/24=5/6.\n\nBut from the first hyperbola equation for point A:\n\na\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1 \u21d2 (24a\u00b2 -20b\u00b2)/480 =1 \u21d224a\u00b2 -20b\u00b2=480 \u21d224a\u00b2 -480 =20b\u00b2 \u21d2 b\u00b2= (24a\u00b2 -480)/20 = (6a\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nThus, b\u00b2 = (6a\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nTherefore, plugging into the condition 24b\u00b2 -20a\u00b2 >0:\n\n24*(6a\u00b2 -120)/5 -20a\u00b2 >0,\n\nMultiply through by 5:\n\n24*(6a\u00b2 -120) -100a\u00b2 >0,\n\n144a\u00b2 -2880 -100a\u00b2 >0 \u21d244a\u00b2 -2880 >0 \u21d244a\u00b2 >2880 \u21d2a\u00b2>2880/44= 65.4545...\n\nThus, a\u00b2 must be greater than 65.4545..., so a must be outside that range.\n\nBut let me proceed.

Therefore, c\u00b2 +d\u00b2=120 +72000/(11x -720).\n\nTo minimize c\u00b2 +d\u00b2, since the second term is positive, we need to minimize 72000/(11x -720), which is equivalent to maximizing the denominator (11x -720).\n\nThus, the minimal value of c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 occurs when (11x -720) is as large as possible, which would be when x approaches infinity.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because then c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 approaches 120. But earlier analysis suggested that as x increases, the term approaches 120 from above?\n\nWait, but in the previous approach using hyperbola parametrization, we found that the minimal value is 120, but that required a to go to infinity. Here, this expression shows that as x\u2192infty, c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 approaches 120, so the infimum is 120, hence BD squared approaches 480. So that aligns with the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible value of BD squared is 480, but it's not achieved, hence the greatest real number less than all BD squared is 480. Therefore, the answer should be 480.\n\nBut wait, let me check with an example. Suppose I choose a very large a, so that x =a\u00b2 is very large. Then point A is (a,b) with b\u00b2=(6a\u00b2-120)/5. So b is roughly sqrt(6/5) a. Then, the vector OA is (a, sqrt(6/5)a). Then, vector OB must be perpendicular to OA, so it's in the direction (-sqrt(6/5),1) or something. Let me see.\n\nLet me suppose that OA is (a, b), and OB is (c,d) perpendicular. Then, the direction of OB is (-b, a) or (b, -a). Let me pick direction (-b, a). Then, scaling to lie on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me suppose OB is proportional to (-b, a). Let me set c= -k b, d= k a.\n\nThen, since (c,d) must satisfy c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1,\n\nso (k\u00b2 b\u00b2)/20 - (k\u00b2 a\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nFactor k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 (b\u00b2/20 -a\u00b2/24)=1,\n\nBut from point A's equation: a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1 \u21d2 b\u00b2/24 =a\u00b2/20 -1 \u21d2 b\u00b2= (24/20)a\u00b2 -24,\n\nWait, let me rearrange:\n\nFrom a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1,\n\nMultiply by 120:6a\u00b2 -5b\u00b2=120 \u21d25b\u00b2=6a\u00b2 -120 \u21d2b\u00b2=(6a\u00b2 -120)/5,\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2/20 -a\u00b2/24= ( (6a\u00b2 -120)/5 ) /20 -a\u00b2/24= (6a\u00b2 -120)/100 -a\u00b2/24,\n\n= (6a\u00b2/100 - 1.2) - (a\u00b2/24).\n\nConvert to common denominator, say 600:\n\n= (36a\u00b2 - 720 -25a\u00b2)/600 = (11a\u00b2 -720)/600,\n\nThus,\n\nk\u00b2*(11a\u00b2 -720)/600=1 \u21d2k\u00b2=600/(11a\u00b2 -720),\n\nTherefore,\n\nc\u00b2 +d\u00b2= k\u00b2 b\u00b2 +k\u00b2 a\u00b2= k\u00b2(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2)= [600/(11a\u00b2 -720)]*(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2).\n\nCompute a\u00b2 +b\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2= a\u00b2 + (6a\u00b2 -120)/5= (5a\u00b2 +6a\u00b2 -120)/5=(11a\u00b2 -120)/5,\n\nThus,\n\nc\u00b2 +d\u00b2= [600/(11a\u00b2 -720)]*(11a\u00b2 -120)/5= [600*(11a\u00b2 -120)]/[5*(11a\u00b2 -720)].\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [120*(11a\u00b2 -120)]/[11a\u00b2 -720]\n\n=120*[ (11a\u00b2 -720 +600) ]/[11a\u00b2 -720]\n\n=120*[1 + 600/(11a\u00b2 -720) ]\n\nWhich matches the previous expression. So as a\u00b2 \u2192infty, this approaches 120, so BD squared approaches 480. Therefore, the infimum is indeed 480.

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD inscribed in the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, with their diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, let me recall some properties of hyperbolas and rhombuses. A rhombus has diagonals that are perpendicular bisectors of each other, and they intersect at the midpoint. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, that means the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. So points A and C are endpoints of one diagonal, and B and D are endpoints of the other diagonal. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, but maybe I can use coordinates to represent the points?\n\nLet me denote the coordinates of points A, B, C, D such that the diagonals intersect at the origin. Let's suppose that the diagonals are AC and BD. Since the origin is the midpoint, if A is (a, b), then C must be (-a, -b). Similarly, if B is (c, d), then D is (-c, -d). \n\nSince all four points lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates must satisfy x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1. So for point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1, and similarly for point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 = 1.\n\nNow, since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal. The sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. Let me see if I can express the lengths of the sides in terms of coordinates. The length of AB would be sqrt[(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2], and similarly for the other sides. Since all sides are equal, this should equal the length of BC, which would be sqrt[(c + a)^2 + (d + b)^2]?\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I get the coordinates right. Let me re-clarify the points. Let me think of the rhombus as having vertices A, B, C, D in order, so that the sides are AB, BC, CD, DA. The diagonals are AC and BD. So if A is (a, b), then C is (-a, -b), as before, and B is (c, d), D is (-c, -d). Then the sides AB would be from (a, b) to (c, d), BC is from (c, d) to (-a, -b), CD is from (-a, -b) to (-c, -d), and DA is from (-c, -d) to (a, b). \n\nSo the length of AB squared is (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2. The length of BC squared is ( -a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2. Since BC is from (c, d) to (-a, -b), so coordinates difference is (-a - c, -b - d). Squared: ( -a - c)^2 + (-b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2. \n\nSimilarly, the length of CD squared is (-c - (-a))^2 + (-d - (-b))^2? Wait, CD is from (-a, -b) to (-c, -d). So the difference is (-c - (-a), -d - (-b)) = (a - c, b - d). So squared length is (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2, same as AB. Similarly DA would be from (-c, -d) to (a, b), so difference (a + c, b + d), squared length (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2, same as BC. \n\nSo all sides squared are either (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 or (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2. Since it's a rhombus, all sides must be equal, so these two expressions must be equal. Therefore:\n\n(a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2 = (a + c)^2 + (b + d)^2.\n\nLet me expand both sides:\n\nLeft side: (a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2)\n\nRight side: (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2) + (b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2)\n\nSubtract left side from right side:\n\n[ (a\u00b2 + 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 + 2bd + d\u00b2) - (a\u00b2 - 2ac + c\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - 2bd + d\u00b2) ]\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\na\u00b2 cancels, c\u00b2 cancels, b\u00b2 cancels, d\u00b2 cancels.\n\nLeft with:\n\n2ac + 2bd - (-2ac -2bd) = 2ac + 2bd + 2ac + 2bd = 4ac +4bd\n\nSet this equal to zero because left side minus right side is zero:\n\nWait, actually, the equation was (left side) = (right side), so right side - left side = 0, so 4ac +4bd =0. So 4(ac + bd)=0 \u21d2 ac + bd =0.\n\nTherefore, the condition for the rhombus is that the coordinates of points A and B satisfy ac + bd =0. \n\nSo, that's a necessary condition.\n\nNow, since A and B lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy:\n\nFor point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nFor point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nAdditionally, ac + bd =0.\n\nOur goal is to find BD\u00b2, which is the square of the distance between points B and D. Since D is (-c, -d), so BD is the distance between (c, d) and (-c, -d), which is sqrt[(2c)^2 + (2d)^2], so BD squared is (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 =4c\u00b2 +4d\u00b2. Therefore, BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So we need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2? Wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi, and then the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum. Wait, but maybe it's the minimal BD\u00b2? Wait, no, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\" So that would be the infimum of BD\u00b2, but since it's asking for the greatest number that is less than all BD\u00b2, so the infimum. So we need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and then the answer is that minimal value? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify.\n\nWait, the question is asking for the greatest real number M such that M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi. So M is the supremum of all numbers less than all BD\u00b2. That would be the infimum of BD\u00b2. Because the greatest lower bound is the infimum. So the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi is the answer. Because that's the largest number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2. But since we need the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, perhaps it's the infimum. Hmm, maybe I need to think in terms of infimum.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some minimal value, but never actually reach it. Then the infimum would be that minimal value, and the answer is that infimum. Alternatively, maybe BD\u00b2 has a minimum, so then the infimum is equal to the minimum, which would be the answer.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2 given the constraints, and that would be the answer.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) given that (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 and ac + bd=0, and (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nHmm, but there are variables a, b, c, d here. We need to find the minimal value of 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) under those constraints.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can parameterize the points on the hyperbola. Let me see if I can parameterize points A and B in terms of hyperbola parameters.\n\nThe hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. A standard hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions: x = sqrt(20) cosh t, y = sqrt(24) sinh t. Alternatively, another parametrization might be useful here, but maybe trigonometric for hyperbola? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe we can set variables such that points are related via some symmetry?\n\nAlternatively, since the diagonals intersect at the origin, and the rhombus is determined by the points A and B (since C and D are determined by symmetry), perhaps we can consider coordinates such that points A and B are related through some condition.\n\nWait, given that ac + bd =0, that's a key equation. Let me see if I can express variables in terms of others.\n\nSuppose I fix point A as (a,b). Then, the coordinates of point B must satisfy (c, d) such that (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 and ac + bd=0. So given a and b, c and d must satisfy those two equations. Then BD squared is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So perhaps I can write this in terms of a and b?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can consider vectors. Let me think of vectors OA and OB, where O is the origin. Since the diagonals are AC and BD, the vectors OA and OB are the vectors from the origin to A and B, respectively. Since the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint, so the other points are just the negatives. \n\nThe condition ac + bd =0 is equivalent to the dot product of vectors OA and OB being zero. So OA \u00b7 OB =0. So vectors OA and OB are perpendicular. Therefore, the vectors from the origin to points A and B must be perpendicular. \n\nAh! That's an important point. So OA is perpendicular to OB. Since the rhombus has diagonals intersecting at right angles? Wait, no, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, hold on. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors of each other. Yes, that's a property of a rhombus. So that's why OA \u00b7 OB =0, because the diagonals are perpendicular. Wait, but in our case, OA and OB are not the diagonals, but the vectors to vertices. Wait, hold on. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the diagonals are AC and BD. The vectors OA and OC are along the diagonal AC, and vectors OB and OD are along BD. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. Since AC is from A to C, which is ( -2a, -2b ), and BD is from B to D, which is ( -2c, -2d ). The vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular, so their dot product is zero:\n\n(-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 4(ac + bd) =0 \u21d2 ac + bd =0. \n\nAh, that's exactly the condition we had earlier. So indeed, the diagonals are perpendicular, which is a property of a rhombus, so that's consistent.\n\nTherefore, the key equations we have are:\n\n1. For point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n2. For point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n3. ac + bd =0,\n\nand BD\u00b2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). We need to minimize BD\u00b2, so find the minimal value of 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) under these constraints.\n\nHmm. Let me see. Since we have three equations and four variables (a, b, c, d), perhaps we can parameterize variables to reduce the number. Let me consider that since OA and OB are perpendicular vectors, we can perhaps set up coordinates such that OA is along some axis, but since hyperbola is symmetric, maybe we can parameterize points A and B in terms of angles or hyperbola parameters?\n\nAlternatively, let me consider that since OA and OB are perpendicular, then (a, b) and (c, d) are perpendicular vectors, so (a, b) \u22c5 (c, d)=0.\n\nLet me think of variables in terms of vectors. Let me denote vector OA = (a, b), vector OB = (c, d). Then OA \u22c5 OB =0, so ac + bd=0. \n\nSo given that OA and OB are perpendicular vectors lying on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So both vectors OA and OB are on the hyperbola, and they are perpendicular. We need to find the minimal value of 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2), which is 4 times the squared length of vector OB. Wait, because BD squared is 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). Wait, BD is the diagonal from B to D, which is twice the vector from O to B, so BD squared is (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 =4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So BD squared is 4 times the squared length of OB. Therefore, minimizing BD squared is equivalent to minimizing the squared length of OB, multiplied by 4. So we can instead minimize |OB|\u00b2 = c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, given that (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 and that OA and OB are perpendicular, with OA also lying on the hyperbola.\n\nHmm. Let me see. Maybe we can parametrize point A as (a, b) on the hyperbola, then express point B in terms of a and b such that (c, d) is perpendicular to (a, b) and also lies on the hyperbola. Then, for each such point A, we can find the possible points B, compute |OB|\u00b2, and then find the minimum over all A and B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can use Lagrange multipliers here. Let me consider variables c and d for point B, with the constraint (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1, and the perpendicularity condition ac + bd =0, where (a, b) is also on the hyperbola. But since (a, b) is also variable, this complicates things. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider that for vectors OA and OB being perpendicular, lying on the hyperbola, so we can set up the problem as follows:\n\nLet me denote OA = (a, b) and OB = (c, d) such that:\n\n1. (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n2. (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\n3. ac + bd =0.\n\nWe need to minimize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2.\n\nLet me think of this as an optimization problem with constraints. Let me consider variables a, b, c, d with these three constraints, and we need to minimize c\u00b2 + d\u00b2. Maybe I can set up Lagrangian multipliers for this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a better way by using the hyperbola's parametrization.\n\nLet me recall that hyperbola can be parametrized using hyperbolic functions. For the hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a standard parametrization is (a cosh\u03b8, b sinh\u03b8). Let me try that here.\n\nLet me set point A as (sqrt(20) cosh\u03b8, sqrt(24) sinh\u03b8). Similarly, point B can be parametrized as (sqrt(20) cosh\u03c6, sqrt(24) sinh\u03c6). Then, the condition that OA and OB are perpendicular is:\n\n[sqrt(20) cosh\u03b8][sqrt(20) cosh\u03c6] + [sqrt(24) sinh\u03b8][sqrt(24) sinh\u03c6] =0,\n\nsince their dot product is zero. Let's compute this:\n\n(20 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6) + (24 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6) =0,\n\nDivide both sides by, say, 4:\n\n5 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 + 6 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0.\n\nHmm, that's an equation relating \u03b8 and \u03c6. Let me see if I can manipulate this equation.\n\nLet me recall some hyperbolic identities. The identity cosh(\u03b8 + \u03c6) = cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 + sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6. So perhaps I can write:\n\n5 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 + 6 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0,\n\nLet me express this as:\n\n5 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 +5 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 + sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0,\n\nSo, 5 (cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 + sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6) + sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0,\n\nWhich is 5 cosh(\u03b8 + \u03c6) + sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6 =0,\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express everything in terms of exponentials?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rearrange the equation:\n\n5 cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 = -6 sinh\u03b8 sinh\u03c6,\n\nDivide both sides by cosh\u03b8 cosh\u03c6 (assuming they are non-zero, which they are except at \u03b8 or \u03c6 being zero, but hyperbola points are away from the origin):\n\n5 = -6 (sinh\u03b8 / cosh\u03b8)(sinh\u03c6 / cosh\u03c6),\n\nWhich is:\n\n5 = -6 tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6,\n\nSo,\n\ntanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6 = -5/6.\n\nHmm, that's a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6.\n\nOur goal is to find the minimal value of c\u00b2 + d\u00b2, which for point B is (sqrt(20) cosh\u03c6)^2 + (sqrt(24) sinh\u03c6)^2 = 20 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 +24 sinh\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nLet me compute that expression:\n\n20 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 +24 sinh\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, perhaps express this in terms of cosh(2\u03c6) or sinh(2\u03c6). Let me recall that cosh\u00b2\u03c6 = (cosh(2\u03c6) +1)/2, sinh\u00b2\u03c6 = (cosh(2\u03c6) -1)/2.\n\nSo substituting:\n\n20*( (cosh2\u03c6 +1)/2 ) +24*( (cosh2\u03c6 -1)/2 )\n\n= [20*(cosh2\u03c6 +1) +24*(cosh2\u03c6 -1)] /2\n\n= [ (20 +24)cosh2\u03c6 + (20 -24) ] /2\n\n= [44 cosh2\u03c6 -4 ] /2\n\n=22 cosh2\u03c6 -2.\n\nTherefore, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 =22 cosh2\u03c6 -2.\n\nSo we need to minimize this expression, given that tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6 = -5/6, where \u03b8 is related to point A, which also lies on the hyperbola. But since point A is arbitrary except for the hyperbola condition, but we have the relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6 via tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6 = -5/6. \n\nTherefore, perhaps we can express \u03b8 in terms of \u03c6, or vice versa, and then express the expression to be minimized in terms of a single variable.\n\nLet me denote t = tanh\u03c6. Then tanh\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 t). However, since tanh\u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, so:\n\n| (-5)/(6 t) | \u22641 \u21d2 |5/(6 t)| \u22641 \u21d2 |t| \u22655/6.\n\nTherefore, |tanh\u03c6| \u22655/6. Since tanh\u03c6 is between -1 and 1, this implies that tanh\u03c6 \u22655/6 or tanh\u03c6 \u2264-5/6.\n\nTherefore, \u03c6 must satisfy |\u03c6| \u2265 arctanh(5/6). \n\nBut let's see, we can write cosh2\u03c6 in terms of tanh\u03c6. Recall that cosh2\u03c6 = (1 + tanh\u00b2\u03c6)/(1 - tanh\u00b2\u03c6). Wait, actually:\n\nLet me recall that cosh\u00b2\u03c6 - sinh\u00b2\u03c6 =1,\n\nand tanh\u03c6 = sinh\u03c6 / cosh\u03c6,\n\nso let me compute cosh2\u03c6:\n\ncosh2\u03c6 = 2 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 -1,\n\nand since tanh\u03c6 = t,\n\ncosh\u00b2\u03c6 =1/(1 - t\u00b2),\n\nso cosh2\u03c6 = 2/(1 - t\u00b2) -1 = (2 - (1 - t\u00b2))/(1 - t\u00b2) ) = (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nWait, cosh2\u03c6 = 2 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 -1,\n\nsince cosh\u00b2\u03c6 = (cosh2\u03c6 +1)/2,\n\nso 2 cosh\u00b2\u03c6 -1 = cosh2\u03c6,\n\nYes. So cosh2\u03c6 =2*(1/(1 - t\u00b2)) -1 = (2 - (1 - t\u00b2))/(1 - t\u00b2) )? Wait, no:\n\nWait, cosh\u00b2\u03c6 = 1/(1 - tanh\u00b2\u03c6) = 1/(1 - t\u00b2). Therefore,\n\ncosh2\u03c6 = 2*(1/(1 - t\u00b2)) -1 = 2/(1 - t\u00b2) -1 = (2 - (1 - t\u00b2))/(1 - t\u00b2) ) = (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nYes, so cosh2\u03c6 = (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 =22 * [ (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ] -2,\n\nwhere t = tanh\u03c6, and |t| \u22655/6.\n\nBut we also have the relation tanh\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 t).\n\nLet me see if there are any constraints on t from this. Since tanh\u03b8 must be in (-1,1), so | (-5)/(6 t) | <1. So |5/(6 t)| <1 \u21d2 |t| >5/6, which is already the condition we had. So that's okay.\n\nTherefore, the expression to minimize is:\n\n22*( (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ) -2,\n\nwith |t| \u22655/6.\n\nBut we can consider t as a real number with |t| \u22655/6, but since the expression is even in t (since replacing t with -t gives same value), we can consider t \u22655/6 or t \u2264-5/6, but since the expression is even, we can just consider t \u22655/6 and find the minimum there.\n\nTherefore, let me set t = tanh\u03c6 \u22655/6 (since we can take \u03c6 positive without loss of generality). Then, let me denote t as a variable \u22655/6, and find the minimal value of f(t)=22*( (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ) -2.\n\nWait, but let me compute f(t):\n\nf(t) =22*( (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ) -2,\n\nLet me simplify this expression:\n\nFirst, write (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) = -( (1 + t\u00b2)/(t\u00b2 -1) )\n\nAlternatively, perhaps rewrite as:\n\nf(t) =22*( (1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ) -2 =22*( (1 - t\u00b2 + 2 t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) ) -2 =22*(1/(1 - t\u00b2) + 2t\u00b2/(1 - t\u00b2)) -2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, let me write f(t) as:\n\nLet me compute f(t):\n\nLet me write numerator: 22*(1 + t\u00b2) -2*(1 - t\u00b2) all over (1 - t\u00b2):\n\nWait,\n\nWait, f(t) =22*(1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) - 2*(1)/(1) ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the second term is -2, so actually f(t) = [22*(1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2)] -2.\n\nAlternatively, combine terms over a common denominator:\n\n= [22(1 + t\u00b2) - 2(1 - t\u00b2)] / (1 - t\u00b2)\n\n= [22 + 22t\u00b2 -2 + 2t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2)\n\n= [20 +24 t\u00b2]/(1 - t\u00b2)\n\nHmm, so f(t) = (24 t\u00b2 +20)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nWait, that's a better expression. Let me check:\n\nYes, 22*(1 + t\u00b2) =22 +22 t\u00b2,\n\nthen subtract 2*(1 - t\u00b2):\n\nWait, no, the -2 is separate. Wait, sorry, original f(t)=22*(1 + t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2) -2.\n\nTherefore, to combine over denominator (1 - t\u00b2):\n\nMultiply the second term by (1 - t\u00b2)/(1 - t\u00b2):\n\n= [22(1 + t\u00b2) -2(1 - t\u00b2)] / (1 - t\u00b2)\n\nYes, that's right.\n\nThen numerator is 22(1 + t\u00b2) -2(1 - t\u00b2) =22 +22 t\u00b2 -2 +2 t\u00b2 =20 +24 t\u00b2,\n\nso f(t)= (24 t\u00b2 +20)/(1 - t\u00b2).\n\nTherefore, the expression to minimize is f(t)= (24 t\u00b2 +20)/(1 - t\u00b2), with t \u22655/6.\n\nWait, but t is tanh\u03c6, which is between -1 and1. Since we are considering t \u22655/6, so t \u2208 [5/6,1). So the domain is t \u2208 [5/6,1).\n\nSo now, we can treat this as a function of t on [5/6, 1) and find its minimum.\n\nLet me compute derivative of f(t) with respect to t:\n\nf(t) = (24t\u00b2 +20)/(1 - t\u00b2)\n\nLet me compute f\u2019(t):\n\nUsing quotient rule,\n\nf\u2019(t)= [ (48t)(1 - t\u00b2) - (24t\u00b2 +20)(-2t) ] / (1 - t\u00b2)^2\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\n48t(1 - t\u00b2) +2t(24t\u00b2 +20)\n\n=48t -48 t\u00b3 +48 t\u00b3 +40 t\n\n= (48t +40t) + (-48 t\u00b3 +48 t\u00b3)\n\n=88t.\n\nTherefore, numerator is 88t,\n\nThus, f\u2019(t)=88t / (1 - t\u00b2)^2.\n\nSince t \u22655/6 >0, the derivative is positive. Therefore, f(t) is increasing on [5/6,1). Therefore, the minimal value occurs at the left endpoint, t=5/6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value is f(5/6).\n\nCompute f(5/6):\n\nFirst, t=5/6,\n\nNumerator:24*(25/36) +20 = (24*25)/36 +20 = (600)/36 +20= 50/3 +20 = (50 +60)/3=110/3,\n\nDenominator:1 - (25/36)= (36 -25)/36=11/36,\n\nThus f(5/6)= (110/3)/(11/36)= (110/3)*(36/11)= (10/3)*36= 10*12=120.\n\nTherefore, the minimal value of c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 is 120, so BD squared is 4*(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2)=4*120=480.\n\nWait, but hold on. Wait, if f(t)=c\u00b2 + d\u00b2= (24t\u00b2 +20)/(1 -t\u00b2), so when t=5/6, f(t)=120, so BD squared is 4*120=480. But the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can be as small as 480, but can it actually reach 480? Because when t approaches 5/6 from above, the minimal value is achieved at t=5/6. But is t=5/6 allowed?\n\nWait, let's check when t=5/6. Since t = tanh\u03c6, so tanh\u03c6=5/6. That is possible because tanh\u03c6 can take any value in (-1,1). So tanh\u03c6=5/6 is achievable. Then, with t=5/6, we can find the corresponding \u03b8 such that tanh\u03b8 = (-5)/(6t)= (-5)/(6*(5/6))= -1.\n\nWait, tanh\u03b8 = -1. But tanh\u03b8 = -1 would require \u03b8 approaching negative infinity, since tanh approaches -1 as \u03b8\u2192-infty. Wait, but tanh\u03b8 can't actually be -1, since it's a limit. Hmm, so here arises a problem. Because tanh\u03b8 =-1 is not achievable, so the minimal value is approached as \u03b8 approaches -infty, but never actually reaches it. Therefore, perhaps the minimal value is not achieved, but approached as t approaches 5/6 from above?\n\nWait, let's see. If t approaches 5/6 from above, then tanh\u03c6 approaches 5/6 from above? Wait, no. Wait, t is tanh\u03c6, so if we set t approaching 5/6 from above, that would require \u03c6 approaching arctanh(5/6) from above, but tanh\u03c6 can't exceed 1, but 5/6 is less than 1. Wait, but if t is approaching 5/6 from above, that would require t to be just over 5/6, but actually tanh\u03c6 can reach exactly 5/6. Wait, tanh\u03c6=5/6 is possible for finite \u03c6. Because arctanh(5/6) is a finite number. Let me compute arctanh(5/6). Since arctanh(x)=0.5*ln((1+x)/(1-x)). So plugging x=5/6:\n\n0.5*ln( (1 +5/6)/(1 -5/6) )=0.5*ln( (11/6)/(1/6) )=0.5*ln(11)=approx 0.5*2.397\u22481.198. So \u03c6 can be that value. Therefore, tanh\u03c6=5/6 is achievable. Therefore, then tanh\u03b8= -5/(6*(5/6))= -1. But tanh\u03b8=-1 is not achievable, but tanh\u03b8 approaches -1 as \u03b8 approaches -infty. Therefore, for \u03b8 to satisfy tanh\u03b8= -1, it would require \u03b8=-infty, which is not a real number. Therefore, this suggests that when t=5/6, the corresponding \u03b8 is not a real number. Therefore, there is inconsistency here.\n\nHmm, so perhaps my parametrization has an issue here. Let me check again.\n\nWe had tanh\u03b8 tanh\u03c6 = -5/6,\n\nIf t = tanh\u03c6 =5/6,\n\nthen tanh\u03b8 = (-5/6)/t = (-5/6)/(5/6)= -1,\n\nSo tanh\u03b8= -1, but that's only possible as \u03b8 approaches -infty. Therefore, in reality, we can't have \u03b8 finite with tanh\u03b8=-1. Therefore, the minimal value at t=5/6 is not achievable because it would require an infinite \u03b8, which is not on the hyperbola. Therefore, the minimal value is approached as \u03b8 approaches -infty and \u03c6 approaches arctanh(5/6). Therefore, the infimum is 480, but it's not attained. Hence, the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. Wait, but since BD\u00b2 can approach 480 but never actually be less than that, so 480 is the infimum. Therefore, the answer should be 480.\n\nWait, but let me verify this again. Suppose we take \u03b8 approaching -infty, so point A approaches the \"left\" vertex of the hyperbola? Wait, hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24=1 has vertices at (\u00b1sqrt(20),0). So as \u03b8 approaches -infty, the point A would be (sqrt(20) cosh\u03b8, sqrt(24) sinh\u03b8). As \u03b8\u2192-infty, cosh\u03b8 ~ e^{-\u03b8}/2, sinh\u03b8 ~ -e^{-\u03b8}/2. Wait, but cosh\u03b8 is always positive, and sinh\u03b8 approaches -infty. So the coordinates of A would be (sqrt(20)* (e^{-\u03b8}/2), sqrt(24)* (-e^{-\u03b8}/2) ). So as \u03b8\u2192-infty, e^{-\u03b8}\u2192+infty, so the coordinates go to infinity, but in the direction of (sqrt(20), -sqrt(24)) scaled by e^{-\u03b8}. Hmm, so point A is going off to infinity in that direction. \n\nMeanwhile, point B is at tanh\u03c6=5/6, so \u03c6=arctanh(5/6). Then coordinates of B are (sqrt(20) cosh\u03c6, sqrt(24) sinh\u03c6). Let me compute that. Let me compute cosh\u03c6 and sinh\u03c6 when tanh\u03c6=5/6.\n\nSince tanh\u03c6=5/6, then sinh\u03c6= (5/6)/sqrt(1 - (25/36))= (5/6)/sqrt(11/36)= (5/6)/(sqrt(11)/6)=5/sqrt(11).\n\nSimilarly, cosh\u03c6=1/sqrt(1 - (25/36))=1/sqrt(11/36)=6/sqrt(11).\n\nTherefore,\n\nc= sqrt(20)* (6/sqrt(11)),\n\nd= sqrt(24)*(5/sqrt(11)),\n\nSo c\u00b2 +d\u00b2=20*(36/11) +24*(25/11)= (720 +600)/11=1320/11=120,\n\nSo BD squared is 4*120=480. But this requires point A to be at \u03b8 where tanh\u03b8=-1, which is at infinity. Therefore, in the limit as \u03b8 approaches -infty, the point A goes to infinity, but point B is fixed at finite coordinates. However, does the rhombus still hold?\n\nWait, if point A is at infinity, then the rhombus would have one vertex at infinity, which might not be considered a valid rhombus? The problem says \"points on the hyperbola\", so maybe they have to be finite points. Therefore, perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is greater than 480, approaching it but never reaching. Therefore, the infimum is 480, so the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 is 480.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another configuration where BD\u00b2 can be smaller? Wait, but according to the calculation, the minimal possible c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 is 120, so BD squared is 480, but it's only achieved in the limit. Since the problem says \"for all such rhombi\", and if the rhombus must have all four vertices on the hyperbola, then perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is indeed 480, but since it's not achieved, the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming the parametrization? Let me think differently.\n\nSuppose instead of hyperbola parametrization, I use coordinates.\n\nLet me consider points A(a,b) and B(c,d) with OA perpendicular to OB. So ac + bd=0.\n\nThey lie on the hyperbola: a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24 =1 and c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of 4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nLet me consider the expression to minimize: 4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2).\n\nSubject to c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nand ac + bd=0,\n\nand a\u00b2/20 - b\u00b2/24=1.\n\nPerhaps I can express a and b in terms of c and d from the perpendicularity condition. From ac + bd=0, we can write a= - (bd)/c, assuming c \u22600. Substitute into the equation for point A:\n\n[ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/c\u00b2 ] /20 - b\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nHmm, this seems messy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe use Lagrange multipliers with variables a,b,c,d.\n\nWe need to minimize f(c,d) =4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2),\n\nwith constraints:\n\n1. g(c,d)= c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24 -1 =0,\n\n2. h(a,b,c,d)= ac + bd =0,\n\n3. k(a,b)=a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24 -1=0.\n\nThis is a constrained optimization problem with four variables and three constraints. Maybe set up Lagrangian:\n\nL =4(c\u00b2 +d\u00b2) + \u03bb(c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24 -1) + \u03bc(ac + bd) + \u03bd(a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24 -1).\n\nThen take partial derivatives with respect to a,b,c,d and set to zero.\n\nCompute partial derivatives:\n\n\u2202L/\u2202a = \u03bc + 2\u03bd a /20 = \u03bc + (\u03bd a)/10 =0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202b = \u03bc d + (-2\u03bd b)/24 = \u03bc d - (\u03bd b)/12 =0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202c =8c + (2\u03bb c)/20 + \u03bc a =8c + (\u03bb c)/10 + \u03bc a =0,\n\n\u2202L/\u2202d =8d + (-2\u03bb d)/24 + \u03bc b =8d - (\u03bb d)/12 + \u03bc b =0,\n\nAlso, the constraints:\n\nac + bd =0,\n\na\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nc\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nThis system of equations may be complex, but perhaps we can find a relation between variables.\n\nFrom the first equation (partial w.r. to a):\n\n\u03bc + (\u03bd a)/10 =0 \u21d2 \u03bc = - (\u03bd a)/10.\n\nFrom the second equation (partial w.r. to b):\n\n\u03bc d - (\u03bd b)/12 =0 \u21d2 \u03bc d = (\u03bd b)/12.\n\nSubstitute \u03bc from first equation into second:\n\n- (\u03bd a)/10 *d = (\u03bd b)/12 \u21d2 - (a d)/10 = b /12 \u21d2 - (12 a d) =10 b \u21d2 b = - (6/5) a d.\n\nEquation (1): b = - (6/5) a d.\n\nFrom the third equation (partial w.r. to c):\n\n8c + (\u03bb c)/10 + \u03bc a =0.\n\nSubstitute \u03bc = - (\u03bd a)/10:\n\n8c + (\u03bb c)/10 - (\u03bd a^2)/10 =0.\n\nSimilarly, fourth equation (partial w.r. to d):\n\n8d - (\u03bb d)/12 + \u03bc b =0.\n\nSubstitute \u03bc = - (\u03bd a)/10 and b= -6/5 a d:\n\n8d - (\u03bb d)/12 + (- \u03bd a /10)(-6/5 a d) =0,\n\nSimplify:\n\n8d - (\u03bb d)/12 + (6 \u03bd a\u00b2 d)/50 =0,\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can find ratios between variables.\n\nAlternatively, let me consider variables a and c, b and d related through the perpendicularity condition.\n\nSuppose we let\u2019s consider vectors OA and OB perpendicular. Let me assume that OA is (a,b), OB is (c,d). Then their dot product is zero: ac + bd =0.\n\nLet me consider that vectors OA and OB are perpendicular, so they form an orthogonal pair on the hyperbola. \n\nSuppose we write OA as (a,b), then OB must satisfy ac + bd=0. Let me parametrize OA as (a,b) on the hyperbola, then OB is a vector perpendicular to OA, lying on the hyperbola. \n\nLet me consider that for any point A on the hyperbola, there might be points B such that OB is perpendicular to OA and also lies on the hyperbola. The minimal BD squared would correspond to the minimal |OB|\u00b2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of the director circle or something similar for hyperbola, but hyperbola's director circle is a bit different.\n\nAlternatively, consider that the minimal value of |OB|\u00b2 given that OB is perpendicular to OA and both lie on the hyperbola. \n\nAlternatively, since we have two equations:\n\na\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nc\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nand ac + bd=0,\n\nWe can try to express variables in terms of a and b.\n\nFrom ac + bd=0 \u21d2 c = - (b d)/a,\n\nAssuming a \u22600,\n\nSubstitute into the second hyperbola equation:\n\n[ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ] /20 - d\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nMultiply through by 20*24*a\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24*(b\u00b2 d\u00b2) -20*24*a\u00b2*d\u00b2/(24) =20*24*a\u00b2*1,\n\nWait, maybe better to rearrange the equation:\n\n(c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nWith c= - (b d)/a,\n\nSo,\n\n[ (b\u00b2 d\u00b2)/a\u00b2 ] /20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nFactor d\u00b2:\n\nd\u00b2 [ (b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) -1/24 ] =1,\n\nLet me denote this as:\n\nd\u00b2 [ (3 b\u00b2 -5 a\u00b2 ) / (120 a\u00b2) ) ] =1,\n\nWait, let me compute the terms:\n\nLet me compute the coefficient:\n\n(b\u00b2)/(20 a\u00b2) -1/24 = (b\u00b2 * 24 - 20 a\u00b2)/ (20*24 a\u00b2) )= (24 b\u00b2 -20 a\u00b2)/ (480 a\u00b2 )\n\nSo,\n\nd\u00b2*(24 b\u00b2 -20 a\u00b2)/(480 a\u00b2)=1,\n\nThus,\n\nd\u00b2 = 480 a\u00b2 / (24 b\u00b2 -20 a\u00b2).\n\nHmm, so d\u00b2 must be positive, so denominator must have same sign as numerator. Since 480 a\u00b2 is positive, denominator must be positive: 24 b\u00b2 -20 a\u00b2 >0 \u21d2 24 b\u00b2 >20 a\u00b2 \u21d2 (b\u00b2/a\u00b2) >20/24=5/6.\n\nBut from the first hyperbola equation for point A:\n\na\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1 \u21d2 (24a\u00b2 -20b\u00b2)/480 =1 \u21d224a\u00b2 -20b\u00b2=480 \u21d224a\u00b2 -480 =20b\u00b2 \u21d2 b\u00b2= (24a\u00b2 -480)/20 = (6a\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nThus, b\u00b2 = (6a\u00b2 -120)/5.\n\nTherefore, plugging into the condition 24b\u00b2 -20a\u00b2 >0:\n\n24*(6a\u00b2 -120)/5 -20a\u00b2 >0,\n\nMultiply through by 5:\n\n24*(6a\u00b2 -120) -100a\u00b2 >0,\n\n144a\u00b2 -2880 -100a\u00b2 >0 \u21d244a\u00b2 -2880 >0 \u21d244a\u00b2 >2880 \u21d2a\u00b2>2880/44= 65.4545...\n\nThus, a\u00b2 must be greater than 65.4545..., so a must be outside that range.\n\nBut let me proceed.

Therefore, c\u00b2 +d\u00b2=120 +72000/(11x -720).\n\nTo minimize c\u00b2 +d\u00b2, since the second term is positive, we need to minimize 72000/(11x -720), which is equivalent to maximizing the denominator (11x -720).\n\nThus, the minimal value of c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 occurs when (11x -720) is as large as possible, which would be when x approaches infinity.\n\nWait, that can't be right, because then c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 approaches 120. But earlier analysis suggested that as x increases, the term approaches 120 from above?\n\nWait, but in the previous approach using hyperbola parametrization, we found that the minimal value is 120, but that required a to go to infinity. Here, this expression shows that as x\u2192infty, c\u00b2 +d\u00b2 approaches 120, so the infimum is 120, hence BD squared approaches 480. So that aligns with the previous result.\n\nTherefore, the minimal possible value of BD squared is 480, but it's not achieved, hence the greatest real number less than all BD squared is 480. Therefore, the answer should be 480.\n\nBut wait, let me check with an example. Suppose I choose a very large a, so that x =a\u00b2 is very large. Then point A is (a,b) with b\u00b2=(6a\u00b2-120)/5. So b is roughly sqrt(6/5) a. Then, the vector OA is (a, sqrt(6/5)a). Then, vector OB must be perpendicular to OA, so it's in the direction (-sqrt(6/5),1) or something. Let me see.\n\nLet me suppose that OA is (a, b), and OB is (c,d) perpendicular. Then, the direction of OB is (-b, a) or (b, -a). Let me pick direction (-b, a). Then, scaling to lie on the hyperbola.\n\nLet me suppose OB is proportional to (-b, a). Let me set c= -k b, d= k a.\n\nThen, since (c,d) must satisfy c\u00b2/20 -d\u00b2/24=1,\n\nso (k\u00b2 b\u00b2)/20 - (k\u00b2 a\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nFactor k\u00b2:\n\nk\u00b2 (b\u00b2/20 -a\u00b2/24)=1,\n\nBut from point A's equation: a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1 \u21d2 b\u00b2/24 =a\u00b2/20 -1 \u21d2 b\u00b2= (24/20)a\u00b2 -24,\n\nWait, let me rearrange:\n\nFrom a\u00b2/20 -b\u00b2/24=1,\n\nMultiply by 120:6a\u00b2 -5b\u00b2=120 \u21d25b\u00b2=6a\u00b2 -120 \u21d2b\u00b2=(6a\u00b2 -120)/5,\n\nSo,\n\nb\u00b2/20 -a\u00b2/24= ( (6a\u00b2 -120)/5 ) /20 -a\u00b2/24= (6a\u00b2 -120)/100 -a\u00b2/24,\n\n= (6a\u00b2/100 - 1.2) - (a\u00b2/24).\n\nConvert to common denominator, say 600:\n\n= (36a\u00b2 - 720 -25a\u00b2)/600 = (11a\u00b2 -720)/600,\n\nThus,\n\nk\u00b2*(11a\u00b2 -720)/600=1 \u21d2k\u00b2=600/(11a\u00b2 -720),\n\nTherefore,\n\nc\u00b2 +d\u00b2= k\u00b2 b\u00b2 +k\u00b2 a\u00b2= k\u00b2(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2)= [600/(11a\u00b2 -720)]*(a\u00b2 +b\u00b2).\n\nCompute a\u00b2 +b\u00b2:\n\na\u00b2 +b\u00b2= a\u00b2 + (6a\u00b2 -120)/5= (5a\u00b2 +6a\u00b2 -120)/5=(11a\u00b2 -120)/5,\n\nThus,\n\nc\u00b2 +d\u00b2= [600/(11a\u00b2 -720)]*(11a\u00b2 -120)/5= [600*(11a\u00b2 -120)]/[5*(11a\u00b2 -720)].\n\nSimplify:\n\n= [120*(11a\u00b2 -120)]/[11a\u00b2 -720]\n\n=120*[ (11a\u00b2 -720 +600) ]/[11a\u00b2 -720]\n\n=120*[1 + 600/(11a\u00b2 -720) ]\n\nWhich matches the previous expression. So as a\u00b2 \u2192infty, this approaches 120, so BD squared approaches 480. Therefore, the infimum is indeed 480. Since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, the answer is 480. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{480}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n\n\nGiven points \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\) on the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) forming a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we need to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\n\n1. **Properties of the Rhombus**:\n   - Diagonals \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\) intersect at the origin and are perpendicular.\n   - Coordinates of points: \\(A(a, b)\\), \\(C(-a, -b)\\), \\(B(c, d)\\), \\(D(-c, -d)\\).\n   - The dot product condition: \\(ac + bd = 0\\).\n\n2. **Hyperbola Equations**:\n   - For \\(A(a, b)\\): \\(\\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1\\).\n   - For \\(B(c, d)\\): \\(\\frac{c^2}{20} - \\frac{d^2}{24} = 1\\).\n\n3. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - \\(BD^2 = 4(c^2 + d^2)\\).\n\n4. **Optimization**:\n   - Using hyperbola parametrization and perpendicularity condition, we derive the expression for \\(c^2 + d^2\\).\n   - Parametrizing points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) using hyperbolic functions and solving the constraints, we find that the minimal value of \\(c^2 + d^2\\) approaches 120 as the points approach infinity.\n\n5. **Result**:\n   - The minimal value of \\(BD^2\\) is \\(4 \\times 120 = 480\\), which is the infimum and thus the greatest real number less than all possible \\(BD^2\\).\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{480}\\).",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin... So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and are perpendicular, right? So the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. \n\nSince the hyperbola is given, all four vertices A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola. Let me recall that in a rhombus, all sides are equal, but maybe more importantly, since diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the coordinates of the points must be arranged such that if one vertex is (x, y), the opposite vertex is (-x, -y). So the four points would be (x1,y1), (-x1,-y1), (x2,y2), (-x2,-y2). Wait, but since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. \n\nWait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular bisectors of each other. So yes, the diagonals are perpendicular. So the product of their slopes is -1. \n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. Let me think: suppose that the vertices are A, B, C, D such that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, similarly for B and D. \n\nTherefore, let me denote points as follows: Let\u2019s suppose point A is (a, b), then point C is (-a, -b). Similarly, point B is (c, d), so point D is (-c, -d). \n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. The vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should all have the same length. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the slopes of AC and BD multiply to -1. Wait, maybe that's a better approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. The vector AC is from A to C which is (-2a, -2b), and BD is from B to D which is (-2c, -2d). Wait, actually, vectors AC is from A to C: ( -a -a, -b -b )? Wait no, coordinates: If point A is (a,b), then point C is (-a,-b). So vector AC is from A to C: (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is from B to D: (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d). Wait, but the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. So (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the vectors AC and BD need to be perpendicular. Wait, actually, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. The vector AC is from point A to point C, which is (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d). Wait, but actually, the vectors AC and BD are vectors themselves, so their dot product should be zero. \n\nWait, but actually, the vectors for the diagonals are AC and BD. So the vectors AC is ( -2a, -2b ), BD is ( -2c, -2d ). Therefore, their dot product should be zero. \n\nThus,\n\n(-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0\n\n=> 4ac + 4bd = 0\n\n=> ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo that's one condition. \n\nAdditionally, since all points lie on the hyperbola, so each point (a,b), (-a,-b), (c,d), (-c,-d) must satisfy the hyperbola equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nTherefore, for point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1,\n\nand for point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSo we have these equations as well.\n\nNow, since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal. Let me see: the length of AB should equal the length of BC, etc. But maybe working with the diagonals is easier. Since in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, and the sides can be expressed in terms of the diagonals. The sides of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: each side is (sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 )). Wait, actually, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sides are equal to sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ), so all sides are equal. \n\nBut perhaps the key here is to find BD\u00b2. Since BD is one of the diagonals. Let me see. The length BD is the distance between points B and D. Since B is (c,d) and D is (-c, -d). Therefore, BD is the distance between (c,d) and (-c, -d). \n\nCalculating BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (c - (-c))\u00b2 + (d - (-d))\u00b2 = (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 = 4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 would be 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2. \n\nBut in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relationship that the sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to 4 times the square of a side. But since all sides are equal, perhaps that's a relation here. But maybe we can work with the given conditions. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, so we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi, and then the answer would be the supremum of numbers less than BD\u00b2, which would be the infimum itself. Wait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". Hmm, so maybe the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum, but since it's asking for the greatest number that is less than all BD\u00b2, it's the infimum. Wait, perhaps. Wait, maybe I need to think carefully here.\n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So we need to find the supremum of all lower bounds for BD\u00b2. That is, the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. Because the greatest number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum. Since it's the greatest lower bound. So we need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and then that minimal value is the answer, because any number less than that would not be an upper lower bound. Wait, actually, perhaps I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimal possible BD\u00b2, so that any number less than that is not an upper bound, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, in other words, find the smallest BD\u00b2 possible, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be approaching that minimal BD\u00b2. But perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is the infimum, so the answer would be that minimal BD\u00b2. Wait, but perhaps BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some value but never actually reach it. Hmm, need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe BD\u00b2 can be made as small as possible, but there's a lower bound. The question wants the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all possible rhombi. So the infimum of BD\u00b2 would be the answer. Let me proceed with that assumption. So to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nSo first, let me note that BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So we need to minimize 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) given the constraints:\n\n1. (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 (since point B is on hyperbola),\n\n2. ac + bd =0 (from the diagonals being perpendicular).\n\nAdditionally, points A and C are also on the hyperbola, so (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSo variables are a, b, c, d, with these equations. But how do we relate them? Since we have two hyperbola equations and the perpendicularity condition. \n\nLet me see. Let me try to express variables in terms of others. Let's see, from the perpendicularity condition ac + bd =0, so we can write d = - (ac)/b, assuming b \u22600. But maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B in terms of parameters.\n\nAlternatively, since points A and B are on the hyperbola, perhaps parametrize them using hyperbola parametrization. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a common parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). Let me try that here.\n\nLet me denote for point A: (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), since the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So a\u00b2=20, b\u00b2=24, so a=2*sqrt(5), b=2*sqrt(6). Therefore, parametrization would be x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 = 2*sqrt(5) sec\u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 = 2*sqrt(6) tan\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, let me parametrize point B as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6). So coordinates for point B are (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, points C and D would be the opposites: (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) and (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). \n\nNow, the diagonals are AC and BD. The vectors AC and BD need to be perpendicular. Wait, but in terms of coordinates, vectors AC is from A to C: which is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly, BD is from B to D: (-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Wait, but actually, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. Wait, but the vectors AC and BD are the diagonals themselves, so their dot product must be zero.\n\nWait, let's compute vectors AC and BD. The coordinates of AC: from point A (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) to point C (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). The vector AC is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly, BD is from B (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6) to D (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan\u03c6), so the vector BD is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6). \n\nThe dot product of AC and BD must be zero:\n\n[(-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8)(-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6)] + [(-4\u221a6 tan\u03b8)(-4\u221a6 tan\u03c6)] =0\n\nWait, let's compute term by term:\n\nFirst component: (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8)(-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6) = 16*5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = 80 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6\n\nSecond component: (-4\u221a6 tan\u03b8)(-4\u221a6 tan\u03c6) = 16*6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 96 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nSo total dot product: 80 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 96 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0\n\nHmm, that's the equation we get from perpendicularity.\n\nSo 80 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +96 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0\n\nLet me see if I can simplify this equation.\n\nFirst, note that sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = 1/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6), and tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6). So substituting these in,\n\n80/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) + 96*(sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) =0\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 to eliminate denominators:\n\n80 +96 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0\n\nSo 96 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -80\n\nDivide both sides by 16: 6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5\n\nSo sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nOkay, so that's one equation. Now, the other conditions are that points A and B are on the hyperbola, but since we parametrized them with the hyperbola parametrization, that's already satisfied.\n\nNow, we need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6 or \u03b8. Let's see.\n\nBD\u00b2 is the square of the distance between points B and D. Since B is (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6) and D is (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). The distance squared between them is:\n\n[2\u221a5 sec\u03c6 - (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6)]\u00b2 + [2\u221a6 tan\u03c6 - (-2\u221a6 tan\u03c6)]\u00b2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(4\u221a5 sec\u03c6)^2 + (4\u221a6 tan\u03c6)^2\n\n= 16*5 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 16*6 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\n= 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nSo BD\u00b2 = 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, given the constraint sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 from above. But we need to relate \u03b8 and \u03c6. Hmm, perhaps we can find a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6?\n\nWait, actually, since in the problem, the rhombus is determined by points A and B, so \u03b8 and \u03c6 are variables subject to sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. But we need to find BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6, but \u03b8 is related to \u03c6 through that equation. So perhaps we can express \u03b8 in terms of \u03c6, then substitute?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider BD\u00b2 as a function of \u03c6, but we need to ensure that there exists a \u03b8 such that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. Since \u03b8 is another variable, perhaps we can find the minimal BD\u00b2 over all \u03c6 where such \u03b8 exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider BD\u00b2 as a function of \u03c6, and find its minimum, but with the constraint that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 must hold for some \u03b8. Since \u03b8 must satisfy that equation, so for a given \u03c6, sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6). Since sin\u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, so |(-5)/(6 sin\u03c6)| \u22641, which implies |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6. Therefore, |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6. So sin\u03c6 must be either \u22655/6 or \u2264-5/6. \n\nTherefore, \u03c6 must be in regions where sin\u03c6 is outside [-5/6,5/6]. So the minimal BD\u00b2 would occur at some \u03c6 where sin\u03c6 is exactly \u00b15/6, perhaps?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me try to express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6, and then find its minimum under the constraint that |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6. Let me see:\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nLet me rewrite this expression in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6.\n\nFirst, note that sec\u00b2\u03c6 =1/cos\u00b2\u03c6, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nTherefore,\n\nBD\u00b2 =80*(1/cos\u00b2\u03c6) +96*(sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6)\n\n= [80 +96 sin\u00b2\u03c6]/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nAlternatively, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [80 +96 sin\u00b2\u03c6]/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express this in terms of sin\u03c6. Let me let s = sin\u03c6, so cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1 -s\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 becomes [80 +96 s\u00b2]/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nBut we have the constraint that |s| \u22655/6. Also, since s = sin\u03c6, so |s| \u22641.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = (80 +96 s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2), where s is in [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6,1].\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 over s in those intervals.\n\nSo let's consider s in [5/6,1], since the function is even in s (since s\u00b2 is the same for s and -s). So we can just consider s in [5/6,1].\n\nSo to find the minimal BD\u00b2, let's compute f(s) = (80 +96 s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nWe can take derivative with respect to s and find critical points.\n\nLet me compute f'(s):\n\nLet f(s) = (80 +96 s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nLet me denote numerator N =80 +96 s\u00b2,\n\ndenominator D =1 - s\u00b2,\n\nthen f\u2019(s) = (N\u2019 D - N D\u2019)/D\u00b2\n\nCompute N\u2019 = 192 s,\n\nD\u2019 = -2s.\n\nThus,\n\nf\u2019(s) = [192 s (1 - s\u00b2) - (80 +96 s\u00b2)(-2s)] / (1 - s\u00b2)^2\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\nFirst term: 192 s (1 - s\u00b2) =192 s - 192 s\u00b3,\n\nSecond term: - (80 +96 s\u00b2)(-2s) = +2s(80 +96 s\u00b2) =160 s +192 s\u00b3.\n\nAdding both terms: 192s -192 s\u00b3 +160 s +192 s\u00b3 = (192s +160s) + (-192 s\u00b3 +192 s\u00b3) = 352 s.\n\nTherefore, numerator is 352 s,\n\nThus, f\u2019(s) = 352 s / (1 - s\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo f\u2019(s) is positive when s>0, and negative when s <0. But since we are considering s in [5/6,1], which is s positive, so f\u2019(s) is positive here. \n\nTherefore, the function f(s) is increasing on [5/6,1], so its minimal value occurs at s=5/6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is f(5/6).\n\nCompute f(5/6):\n\nFirst compute s=5/6,\n\ns\u00b2 =25/36,\n\nNumerator:80 +96*(25/36)=80 + (96*25)/36\n\nCompute 96/36 = 8/3, so 8/3 *25 = 200/3,\n\nThus numerator:80 +200/3 = (240 +200)/3 =440/3,\n\nDenominator:1 -25/36 =11/36,\n\nThus f(5/6)= (440/3)/(11/36)= (440/3)*(36/11)= (440*36)/(3*11).\n\nSimplify:\n\n440 divided by 11 is 40,\n\n36 divided by 3 is 12,\n\nThus 40*12=480.\n\nTherefore BD\u00b2=480 when s=5/6, which is the minimal value. \n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 can get as low as 480, and since the function is increasing beyond that, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480. But wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". Since 480 is attainable, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480 itself? Wait, no, if BD\u00b2 can actually reach 480, then numbers less than BD\u00b2 must be less than or equal to 480, but the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 would be 480? But 480 is achieved, so there are rhombi with BD\u00b2=480, so the numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than 480. So the supremum of such numbers would be 480. Wait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So if there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but exactly equal for some. So the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be approaching 480 from below. But since 480 is attainable, then there is no such greatest number, but perhaps the question is actually asking for the minimal BD\u00b2, so the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480? \n\nWait, the wording is confusing. Let me re-read the question:\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, in other words, find the largest number M such that M < BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus. So M must be less than every possible BD\u00b2. The largest such M is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can actually attain 480, then the infimum is 480, so the greatest M less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. But since M has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, so M must be less than 480. But the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". Since 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, the supremum of all M such that M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because any number less than 480 is less than all BD\u00b2, but 480 itself is not less than all BD\u00b2 (since it's equal to some). However, in the real numbers, there is no number that is the greatest such M, since for any number less than 480, you can have a number closer to 480. But the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". In real analysis, the supremum of such M is 480, even though it's not attained. So perhaps the answer is 480. Maybe the question is just asking for the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 480, so the answer is 480. Since the problem says \"the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\", then technically, the answer is 480, because you can approach it arbitrarily close, but the supremum is 480. However, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me confirm my calculations again.\n\nLet me check the calculation for BD\u00b2 when s=5/6:\n\nFirst, s = sin\u03c6 =5/6. Then cos\u03c6 = sqrt(1 - (25/36)) = sqrt(11/36)=sqrt(11)/6.\n\nThus, cos\u00b2\u03c6=11/36,\n\nNumerator of BD\u00b2 expression:\n\n80 +96*(25/36)=80 + (96*25)/36.\n\nCalculating 96 divided by 36: 96/36 = 8/3, so 8/3 *25 = 200/3,\n\n80 is 240/3,\n\nso total numerator:240/3 +200/3 =440/3,\n\nDenominator is 11/36,\n\nSo (440/3)/(11/36) = (440/3)*(36/11)= (440*36)/(3*11).\n\nSimplify:\n\n440 divided by 11 is 40,\n\n36 divided by 3 is 12,\n\n40*12=480. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore BD\u00b2 can indeed be 480. So the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 would be approaching 480, but since it's asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, that would be 480. But since 480 is actually achieved, the number must be less than 480. Hmm, maybe there is a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the minimal BD\u00b2, but instead, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because if you take any number less than 480, then it is less than all BD\u00b2, since the minimal is 480. Wait, no, if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then a number less than 480 is not less than all BD\u00b2, because 480 is a BD\u00b2. Wait, that's the problem. \n\nWait, actually, if you have a number M that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then M must be less than 480, because there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480. Therefore, the greatest such M is the infimum, which is 480, but since M has to be less than all BD\u00b2, the supremum of such M is 480, but it's not attained. So the answer is 480. Since in the real numbers, the supremum of all M less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, even though 480 itself is not less than all BD\u00b2 (because it's equal to some). But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So the answer is 480? Because any number less than 480 would not be the greatest possible. Wait, actually, no. The problem is a bit ambiguous, but in mathematics, when they ask for the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2, it's the infimum, which is 480, but since it's attainable, perhaps the question is expecting 480. Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, \"less than\" is strict, so since 480 is attainable, you can't have a number that is less than all BD\u00b2 and greater than or equal to 480. Therefore, the supremum is 480, so the answer is 480. Maybe in the problem's context, they just want the minimal BD\u00b2, so 480.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in parametrization? Let me think again. Let me see another approach.\n\nSuppose that in the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, the points A, B, C, D are such that the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. Let me consider coordinates of points such that A is (p, q), then C is (-p, -q), B is (r, s), D is (-r, -s). The diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, so (vector AC) \u2022 (vector BD) =0.\n\nVector AC is (-2p, -2q), BD is (-2r, -2s). Their dot product is 4(pr + qs)=0, so pr + qs =0.\n\nAdditionally, all points lie on the hyperbola: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1, r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 = (2r)^2 + (2s)^2 =4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), given that r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1 and pr + qs =0, and also p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1. But we need to relate p and q with r and s via pr + qs =0.\n\nAlternatively, since p and q are variables subject to their own hyperbola equation, perhaps we can express p and q in terms of r and s?\n\nFrom pr + qs =0, we can write p = - (qs)/r, provided r \u22600. Then substitute into the equation p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo substituting p = - (qs)/r,\n\n[ (q\u00b2 s\u00b2)/(r\u00b2) ] /20 - q\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nMultiply through by 20*24*r\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24 q\u00b2 s\u00b2 -20*24 q\u00b2 r\u00b2 =20*24 r\u00b2,\n\nHmm, this might get complicated. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, using Lagrange multipliers. Let me consider variables r and s, with the constraint that r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1 (since point B is on hyperbola). Also, the other constraint pr + qs =0, but p and q are also variables on their hyperbola. This might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since we want to minimize 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2) with r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1, but also with the existence of p and q such that p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1 and pr + qs=0. \n\nWait, so for given r and s, we need to have existence of p and q on hyperbola such that pr + qs=0. So for given r and s, there must exist (p, q) on hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 such that pr + qs=0. \n\nThe equation pr + qs =0 can be thought of as a linear equation in variables p and q. So the line pr + qs =0 must intersect the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. For such an intersection to exist, the line must not be tangent or non-intersecting. \n\nAlternatively, the condition for the line pr + qs =0 to intersect the hyperbola is that the distance from the center to the line divided by the appropriate term must satisfy some inequality, but perhaps it's easier to substitute.\n\nLet me parametrize p and q. Let me set variables such that p and q satisfy pr + qs =0. Let me solve for p in terms of q: p = - (qs)/r. Then substitute into hyperbola equation for p and q:\n\n[ ( ( - (qs)/r )\u00b2 ) ] /20 - q\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nSo (q\u00b2 s\u00b2)/(20 r\u00b2) - q\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nFactor out q\u00b2:\n\nq\u00b2 [ s\u00b2/(20 r\u00b2) - 1/24 ] =1,\n\nSo for this equation to have a real solution q, the term in brackets must be positive or negative such that the product can equal 1. Wait, let's see:\n\nLet me write:\n\nq\u00b2 = 1 / [ (s\u00b2)/(20 r\u00b2) - 1/24 ]\n\nFor this to be possible, the denominator must be positive (since q\u00b2 is non-negative). Therefore,\n\n(s\u00b2)/(20 r\u00b2) - 1/24 >0,\n\n=> (s\u00b2)/(20 r\u00b2) >1/24,\n\n=> 24 s\u00b2 >20 r\u00b2,\n\n=> 6 s\u00b2 >5 r\u00b2,\n\nSo 6s\u00b2 -5r\u00b2 >0.\n\nTherefore, given r and s, the condition is that 6 s\u00b2 -5 r\u00b2 >0.\n\nBut also, r and s must satisfy the hyperbola equation: r\u00b2/20 -s\u00b2/24=1,\n\nLet me write that as (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nLet me express s\u00b2 from this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 =24*( (r\u00b2)/20 -1 ) = (24/20)r\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)r\u00b2 -24.\n\nSubstitute into the inequality 6s\u00b2 -5r\u00b2 >0,\n\n6*( (6/5 r\u00b2 -24) ) -5r\u00b2 >0,\n\nCompute:\n\n6*(6/5 r\u00b2) -6*24 -5r\u00b2,\n\n= (36/5 r\u00b2) -144 -5r\u00b2,\n\n= (36/5 -25/5)r\u00b2 -144,\n\n= (11/5)r\u00b2 -144 >0,\n\n=> (11/5) r\u00b2 >144,\n\n=> r\u00b2 > (144 *5)/11 =720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\nTherefore, for given r and s on the hyperbola (so r\u00b2/20 -s\u00b2/24=1), the inequality 6s\u00b2 -5r\u00b2 >0 requires that r\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nBut we also have s\u00b2 = (6/5)r\u00b2 -24,\n\nSo BD\u00b2 =4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2)=4[ r\u00b2 + (6/5 r\u00b2 -24) ]=4[ (11/5 r\u00b2) -24 ]\n\nSo BD\u00b2=4*(11/5 r\u00b2 -24)= (44/5)r\u00b2 -96.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2, so since BD\u00b2 increases with r\u00b2, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when r\u00b2 is as small as possible, which is r\u00b2=720/11.\n\nPlugging r\u00b2=720/11 into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (44/5)*(720/11) -96.\n\nSimplify:\n\n44/5 *720/11 = (44/11)*(720/5)=4*(144)=576,\n\nTherefore BD\u00b2=576 -96=480.\n\nSo that's the same result as before. Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is indeed 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480. Since it's attainable, the answer is 480. Therefore, boxed answer is \\boxed{480}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombuses ABCD on the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 = 1, with diagonals intersecting at the origin. Hmm, rhombus with diagonals intersecting at the origin... So, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles? Wait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other and are perpendicular, right? So the origin is the midpoint of both diagonals. \n\nSince the hyperbola is given, all four vertices A, B, C, D lie on this hyperbola. Let me recall that in a rhombus, all sides are equal, but maybe more importantly, since diagonals bisect each other at the origin, the coordinates of the points must be arranged such that if one vertex is (x, y), the opposite vertex is (-x, -y). So the four points would be (x1,y1), (-x1,-y1), (x2,y2), (-x2,-y2). Wait, but since it's a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular. \n\nWait, actually, in a rhombus, the diagonals are not necessarily perpendicular unless it's a square. Wait, no, correction: in a rhombus, the diagonals are always perpendicular bisectors of each other. So yes, the diagonals are perpendicular. So the product of their slopes is -1. \n\nSince the diagonals intersect at the origin, which is their midpoint. Let me think: suppose that the vertices are A, B, C, D such that the diagonals AC and BD intersect at the origin. So coordinates of A and C are negatives of each other, similarly for B and D. \n\nTherefore, let me denote points as follows: Let\u2019s suppose point A is (a, b), then point C is (-a, -b). Similarly, point B is (c, d), so point D is (-c, -d). \n\nSince ABCD is a rhombus, all sides are equal. The vectors AB, BC, CD, DA should all have the same length. Alternatively, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the slopes of AC and BD multiply to -1. Wait, maybe that's a better approach. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, since diagonals are perpendicular, the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular. The vector AC is from A to C which is (-2a, -2b), and BD is from B to D which is (-2c, -2d). Wait, actually, vectors AC is from A to C: ( -a -a, -b -b )? Wait no, coordinates: If point A is (a,b), then point C is (-a,-b). So vector AC is from A to C: (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is from B to D: (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d). Wait, but the vectors AC and BD are perpendicular, so their dot product is zero. So (-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0? Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the vectors AC and BD need to be perpendicular. Wait, actually, the vectors AC and BD must be perpendicular. The vector AC is from point A to point C, which is (-a - a, -b - b) = (-2a, -2b). Similarly, BD is from B to D, which is (-c - c, -d - d) = (-2c, -2d). Wait, but actually, the vectors AC and BD are vectors themselves, so their dot product should be zero. \n\nWait, but actually, the vectors for the diagonals are AC and BD. So the vectors AC is ( -2a, -2b ), BD is ( -2c, -2d ). Therefore, their dot product should be zero. \n\nThus,\n\n(-2a)(-2c) + (-2b)(-2d) = 0\n\n=> 4ac + 4bd = 0\n\n=> ac + bd = 0.\n\nSo that's one condition. \n\nAdditionally, since all points lie on the hyperbola, so each point (a,b), (-a,-b), (c,d), (-c,-d) must satisfy the hyperbola equation x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nTherefore, for point A: (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 = 1,\n\nand for point B: (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSo we have these equations as well.\n\nNow, since it's a rhombus, the sides are equal. Let me see: the length of AB should equal the length of BC, etc. But maybe working with the diagonals is easier. Since in a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular bisectors, and the sides can be expressed in terms of the diagonals. The sides of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula: each side is (sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 )). Wait, actually, since the diagonals are perpendicular, the sides are equal to sqrt( (d1/2)^2 + (d2/2)^2 ), so all sides are equal. \n\nBut perhaps the key here is to find BD\u00b2. Since BD is one of the diagonals. Let me see. The length BD is the distance between points B and D. Since B is (c,d) and D is (-c, -d). Therefore, BD is the distance between (c,d) and (-c, -d). \n\nCalculating BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (c - (-c))\u00b2 + (d - (-d))\u00b2 = (2c)^2 + (2d)^2 = 4c\u00b2 + 4d\u00b2.\n\nSimilarly, AC\u00b2 would be 4a\u00b2 +4b\u00b2. \n\nBut in a rhombus, the diagonals satisfy the relationship that the sum of the squares of the diagonals is equal to 4 times the square of a side. But since all sides are equal, perhaps that's a relation here. But maybe we can work with the given conditions. \n\nAlternatively, since the problem asks for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi, so we need to find the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all possible such rhombi, and then the answer would be the supremum of numbers less than BD\u00b2, which would be the infimum itself. Wait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". Hmm, so maybe the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum, but since it's asking for the greatest number that is less than all BD\u00b2, it's the infimum. Wait, perhaps. Wait, maybe I need to think carefully here.\n\nWait, the question is phrased as \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So we need to find the supremum of all lower bounds for BD\u00b2. That is, the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. Because the greatest number that is less than or equal to all BD\u00b2 would be the infimum. Since it's the greatest lower bound. So we need to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, and then that minimal value is the answer, because any number less than that would not be an upper lower bound. Wait, actually, perhaps I need to confirm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the minimal possible BD\u00b2, so that any number less than that is not an upper bound, but the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So, in other words, find the smallest BD\u00b2 possible, then the greatest number less than all BD\u00b2 would be approaching that minimal BD\u00b2. But perhaps the minimal BD\u00b2 is the infimum, so the answer would be that minimal BD\u00b2. Wait, but perhaps BD\u00b2 can get arbitrarily close to some value but never actually reach it. Hmm, need to clarify.\n\nAlternatively, maybe BD\u00b2 can be made as small as possible, but there's a lower bound. The question wants the greatest number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all possible rhombi. So the infimum of BD\u00b2 would be the answer. Let me proceed with that assumption. So to find the minimal possible BD\u00b2, given the constraints.\n\nSo first, let me note that BD\u00b2 = 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2). So we need to minimize 4(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2) given the constraints:\n\n1. (c\u00b2)/20 - (d\u00b2)/24 =1 (since point B is on hyperbola),\n\n2. ac + bd =0 (from the diagonals being perpendicular).\n\nAdditionally, points A and C are also on the hyperbola, so (a\u00b2)/20 - (b\u00b2)/24 =1.\n\nSo variables are a, b, c, d, with these equations. But how do we relate them? Since we have two hyperbola equations and the perpendicularity condition. \n\nLet me see. Let me try to express variables in terms of others. Let's see, from the perpendicularity condition ac + bd =0, so we can write d = - (ac)/b, assuming b \u22600. But maybe that's not the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps we can parametrize points A and B in terms of parameters.\n\nAlternatively, since points A and B are on the hyperbola, perhaps parametrize them using hyperbola parametrization. For hyperbola x\u00b2/a\u00b2 - y\u00b2/b\u00b2 =1, a common parametrization is (a sec\u03b8, b tan\u03b8). Let me try that here.\n\nLet me denote for point A: (sqrt(20) sec\u03b8, sqrt(24) tan\u03b8), since the hyperbola equation is x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. So a\u00b2=20, b\u00b2=24, so a=2*sqrt(5), b=2*sqrt(6). Therefore, parametrization would be x = sqrt(20) sec\u03b8 = 2*sqrt(5) sec\u03b8, y = sqrt(24) tan\u03b8 = 2*sqrt(6) tan\u03b8.\n\nSimilarly, let me parametrize point B as (sqrt(20) sec\u03c6, sqrt(24) tan\u03c6). So coordinates for point B are (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6).\n\nThen, points C and D would be the opposites: (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) and (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). \n\nNow, the diagonals are AC and BD. The vectors AC and BD need to be perpendicular. Wait, but in terms of coordinates, vectors AC is from A to C: which is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly, BD is from B to D: (-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6). Wait, but actually, the vectors AC and BD should be perpendicular. Wait, but the vectors AC and BD are the diagonals themselves, so their dot product must be zero.\n\nWait, let's compute vectors AC and BD. The coordinates of AC: from point A (2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, 2\u221a6 tan\u03b8) to point C (-2\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -2\u221a6 tan\u03b8). The vector AC is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8, -4\u221a6 tan\u03b8). Similarly, BD is from B (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6) to D (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan\u03c6), so the vector BD is (-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -4\u221a6 tan\u03c6). \n\nThe dot product of AC and BD must be zero:\n\n[(-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8)(-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6)] + [(-4\u221a6 tan\u03b8)(-4\u221a6 tan\u03c6)] =0\n\nWait, let's compute term by term:\n\nFirst component: (-4\u221a5 sec\u03b8)(-4\u221a5 sec\u03c6) = 16*5 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = 80 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6\n\nSecond component: (-4\u221a6 tan\u03b8)(-4\u221a6 tan\u03c6) = 16*6 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = 96 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6\n\nSo total dot product: 80 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 + 96 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0\n\nHmm, that's the equation we get from perpendicularity.\n\nSo 80 sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 +96 tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 =0\n\nLet me see if I can simplify this equation.\n\nFirst, note that sec\u03b8 sec\u03c6 = 1/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6), and tan\u03b8 tan\u03c6 = (sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6). So substituting these in,\n\n80/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) + 96*(sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6)/(cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6) =0\n\nMultiply both sides by cos\u03b8 cos\u03c6 to eliminate denominators:\n\n80 +96 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 =0\n\nSo 96 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -80\n\nDivide both sides by 16: 6 sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5\n\nSo sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6\n\nOkay, so that's one equation. Now, the other conditions are that points A and B are on the hyperbola, but since we parametrized them with the hyperbola parametrization, that's already satisfied.\n\nNow, we need to express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6 or \u03b8. Let's see.\n\nBD\u00b2 is the square of the distance between points B and D. Since B is (2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, 2\u221a6 tan\u03c6) and D is (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6, -2\u221a6 tan\u03c6). The distance squared between them is:\n\n[2\u221a5 sec\u03c6 - (-2\u221a5 sec\u03c6)]\u00b2 + [2\u221a6 tan\u03c6 - (-2\u221a6 tan\u03c6)]\u00b2\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(4\u221a5 sec\u03c6)^2 + (4\u221a6 tan\u03c6)^2\n\n= 16*5 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 16*6 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\n= 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2\u03c6\n\nSo BD\u00b2 = 80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 + 96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2, given the constraint sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 from above. But we need to relate \u03b8 and \u03c6. Hmm, perhaps we can find a relation between \u03b8 and \u03c6?\n\nWait, actually, since in the problem, the rhombus is determined by points A and B, so \u03b8 and \u03c6 are variables subject to sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. But we need to find BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6, but \u03b8 is related to \u03c6 through that equation. So perhaps we can express \u03b8 in terms of \u03c6, then substitute?\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can consider BD\u00b2 as a function of \u03c6, but we need to ensure that there exists a \u03b8 such that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6. Since \u03b8 is another variable, perhaps we can find the minimal BD\u00b2 over all \u03c6 where such \u03b8 exists.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we can consider BD\u00b2 as a function of \u03c6, and find its minimum, but with the constraint that sin\u03b8 sin\u03c6 = -5/6 must hold for some \u03b8. Since \u03b8 must satisfy that equation, so for a given \u03c6, sin\u03b8 = (-5)/(6 sin\u03c6). Since sin\u03b8 must be between -1 and 1, so |(-5)/(6 sin\u03c6)| \u22641, which implies |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6. Therefore, |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6. So sin\u03c6 must be either \u22655/6 or \u2264-5/6. \n\nTherefore, \u03c6 must be in regions where sin\u03c6 is outside [-5/6,5/6]. So the minimal BD\u00b2 would occur at some \u03c6 where sin\u03c6 is exactly \u00b15/6, perhaps?\n\nWait, let's see. Let me try to express BD\u00b2 in terms of \u03c6, and then find its minimum under the constraint that |sin\u03c6| \u22655/6. Let me see:\n\nBD\u00b2 =80 sec\u00b2\u03c6 +96 tan\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nLet me rewrite this expression in terms of sin\u03c6 and cos\u03c6.\n\nFirst, note that sec\u00b2\u03c6 =1/cos\u00b2\u03c6, tan\u00b2\u03c6 = sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nTherefore,\n\nBD\u00b2 =80*(1/cos\u00b2\u03c6) +96*(sin\u00b2\u03c6 / cos\u00b2\u03c6)\n\n= [80 +96 sin\u00b2\u03c6]/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nAlternatively, let me write this as:\n\nBD\u00b2 = [80 +96 sin\u00b2\u03c6]/cos\u00b2\u03c6.\n\nHmm, perhaps we can express this in terms of sin\u03c6. Let me let s = sin\u03c6, so cos\u00b2\u03c6 =1 -s\u00b2.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 becomes [80 +96 s\u00b2]/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nBut we have the constraint that |s| \u22655/6. Also, since s = sin\u03c6, so |s| \u22641.\n\nTherefore, BD\u00b2 = (80 +96 s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2), where s is in [-1, -5/6] \u222a [5/6,1].\n\nWe need to find the minimal value of BD\u00b2 over s in those intervals.\n\nSo let's consider s in [5/6,1], since the function is even in s (since s\u00b2 is the same for s and -s). So we can just consider s in [5/6,1].\n\nSo to find the minimal BD\u00b2, let's compute f(s) = (80 +96 s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nWe can take derivative with respect to s and find critical points.\n\nLet me compute f'(s):\n\nLet f(s) = (80 +96 s\u00b2)/(1 - s\u00b2).\n\nLet me denote numerator N =80 +96 s\u00b2,\n\ndenominator D =1 - s\u00b2,\n\nthen f\u2019(s) = (N\u2019 D - N D\u2019)/D\u00b2\n\nCompute N\u2019 = 192 s,\n\nD\u2019 = -2s.\n\nThus,\n\nf\u2019(s) = [192 s (1 - s\u00b2) - (80 +96 s\u00b2)(-2s)] / (1 - s\u00b2)^2\n\nLet me compute numerator:\n\nFirst term: 192 s (1 - s\u00b2) =192 s - 192 s\u00b3,\n\nSecond term: - (80 +96 s\u00b2)(-2s) = +2s(80 +96 s\u00b2) =160 s +192 s\u00b3.\n\nAdding both terms: 192s -192 s\u00b3 +160 s +192 s\u00b3 = (192s +160s) + (-192 s\u00b3 +192 s\u00b3) = 352 s.\n\nTherefore, numerator is 352 s,\n\nThus, f\u2019(s) = 352 s / (1 - s\u00b2)^2.\n\nSo f\u2019(s) is positive when s>0, and negative when s <0. But since we are considering s in [5/6,1], which is s positive, so f\u2019(s) is positive here. \n\nTherefore, the function f(s) is increasing on [5/6,1], so its minimal value occurs at s=5/6.\n\nTherefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is f(5/6).\n\nCompute f(5/6):\n\nFirst compute s=5/6,\n\ns\u00b2 =25/36,\n\nNumerator:80 +96*(25/36)=80 + (96*25)/36\n\nCompute 96/36 = 8/3, so 8/3 *25 = 200/3,\n\nThus numerator:80 +200/3 = (240 +200)/3 =440/3,\n\nDenominator:1 -25/36 =11/36,\n\nThus f(5/6)= (440/3)/(11/36)= (440/3)*(36/11)= (440*36)/(3*11).\n\nSimplify:\n\n440 divided by 11 is 40,\n\n36 divided by 3 is 12,\n\nThus 40*12=480.\n\nTherefore BD\u00b2=480 when s=5/6, which is the minimal value. \n\nWait, so BD\u00b2 can get as low as 480, and since the function is increasing beyond that, so the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480. Therefore, the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi would be 480. But wait, the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". Since 480 is attainable, then the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be 480 itself? Wait, no, if BD\u00b2 can actually reach 480, then numbers less than BD\u00b2 must be less than or equal to 480, but the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 would be 480? But 480 is achieved, so there are rhombi with BD\u00b2=480, so the numbers less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi must be less than 480. So the supremum of such numbers would be 480. Wait, but the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So if there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, then 480 is not less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but exactly equal for some. So the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi would be approaching 480 from below. But since 480 is attainable, then there is no such greatest number, but perhaps the question is actually asking for the minimal BD\u00b2, so the infimum is 480, so the answer is 480? \n\nWait, the wording is confusing. Let me re-read the question:\n\n\"Find the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi.\"\n\nSo, in other words, find the largest number M such that M < BD\u00b2 for every possible rhombus. So M must be less than every possible BD\u00b2. The largest such M is the infimum of BD\u00b2 over all such rhombi. Since BD\u00b2 can actually attain 480, then the infimum is 480, so the greatest M less than all BD\u00b2 is 480. But since M has to be less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, but there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480, so M must be less than 480. But the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". Since 480 is the minimal BD\u00b2, the supremum of all M such that M < BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because any number less than 480 is less than all BD\u00b2, but 480 itself is not less than all BD\u00b2 (since it's equal to some). However, in the real numbers, there is no number that is the greatest such M, since for any number less than 480, you can have a number closer to 480. But the question says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". In real analysis, the supremum of such M is 480, even though it's not attained. So perhaps the answer is 480. Maybe the question is just asking for the minimal BD\u00b2, which is 480, so the answer is 480. Since the problem says \"the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\", then technically, the answer is 480, because you can approach it arbitrarily close, but the supremum is 480. However, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me confirm my calculations again.\n\nLet me check the calculation for BD\u00b2 when s=5/6:\n\nFirst, s = sin\u03c6 =5/6. Then cos\u03c6 = sqrt(1 - (25/36)) = sqrt(11/36)=sqrt(11)/6.\n\nThus, cos\u00b2\u03c6=11/36,\n\nNumerator of BD\u00b2 expression:\n\n80 +96*(25/36)=80 + (96*25)/36.\n\nCalculating 96 divided by 36: 96/36 = 8/3, so 8/3 *25 = 200/3,\n\n80 is 240/3,\n\nso total numerator:240/3 +200/3 =440/3,\n\nDenominator is 11/36,\n\nSo (440/3)/(11/36) = (440/3)*(36/11)= (440*36)/(3*11).\n\nSimplify:\n\n440 divided by 11 is 40,\n\n36 divided by 3 is 12,\n\n40*12=480. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore BD\u00b2 can indeed be 480. So the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2 would be approaching 480, but since it's asking for the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, that would be 480. But since 480 is actually achieved, the number must be less than 480. Hmm, maybe there is a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not considering the minimal BD\u00b2, but instead, the minimal BD\u00b2 is 480, so the greatest number less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480. Because if you take any number less than 480, then it is less than all BD\u00b2, since the minimal is 480. Wait, no, if BD\u00b2 can be 480, then a number less than 480 is not less than all BD\u00b2, because 480 is a BD\u00b2. Wait, that's the problem. \n\nWait, actually, if you have a number M that is less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi, then M must be less than 480, because there exists a rhombus with BD\u00b2=480. Therefore, the greatest such M is the infimum, which is 480, but since M has to be less than all BD\u00b2, the supremum of such M is 480, but it's not attained. So the answer is 480. Since in the real numbers, the supremum of all M less than BD\u00b2 for all rhombi is 480, even though 480 itself is not less than all BD\u00b2 (because it's equal to some). But the problem says \"the greatest real number that is less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi\". So the answer is 480? Because any number less than 480 would not be the greatest possible. Wait, actually, no. The problem is a bit ambiguous, but in mathematics, when they ask for the greatest real number less than all BD\u00b2, it's the infimum, which is 480, but since it's attainable, perhaps the question is expecting 480. Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, \"less than\" is strict, so since 480 is attainable, you can't have a number that is less than all BD\u00b2 and greater than or equal to 480. Therefore, the supremum is 480, so the answer is 480. Maybe in the problem's context, they just want the minimal BD\u00b2, so 480.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in parametrization? Let me think again. Let me see another approach.\n\nSuppose that in the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1, the points A, B, C, D are such that the diagonals intersect at the origin and are perpendicular. Let me consider coordinates of points such that A is (p, q), then C is (-p, -q), B is (r, s), D is (-r, -s). The diagonals AC and BD are perpendicular, so (vector AC) \u2022 (vector BD) =0.\n\nVector AC is (-2p, -2q), BD is (-2r, -2s). Their dot product is 4(pr + qs)=0, so pr + qs =0.\n\nAdditionally, all points lie on the hyperbola: p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1, r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2 = (2r)^2 + (2s)^2 =4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2).\n\nSo, the problem reduces to minimizing 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2), given that r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1 and pr + qs =0, and also p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24=1. But we need to relate p and q with r and s via pr + qs =0.\n\nAlternatively, since p and q are variables subject to their own hyperbola equation, perhaps we can express p and q in terms of r and s?\n\nFrom pr + qs =0, we can write p = - (qs)/r, provided r \u22600. Then substitute into the equation p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1.\n\nSo substituting p = - (qs)/r,\n\n[ (q\u00b2 s\u00b2)/(r\u00b2) ] /20 - q\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nMultiply through by 20*24*r\u00b2 to eliminate denominators:\n\n24 q\u00b2 s\u00b2 -20*24 q\u00b2 r\u00b2 =20*24 r\u00b2,\n\nHmm, this might get complicated. Maybe another approach is better.\n\nAlternatively, using Lagrange multipliers. Let me consider variables r and s, with the constraint that r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1 (since point B is on hyperbola). Also, the other constraint pr + qs =0, but p and q are also variables on their hyperbola. This might not be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, since we want to minimize 4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2) with r\u00b2/20 - s\u00b2/24 =1, but also with the existence of p and q such that p\u00b2/20 - q\u00b2/24 =1 and pr + qs=0. \n\nWait, so for given r and s, we need to have existence of p and q on hyperbola such that pr + qs=0. So for given r and s, there must exist (p, q) on hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1 such that pr + qs=0. \n\nThe equation pr + qs =0 can be thought of as a linear equation in variables p and q. So the line pr + qs =0 must intersect the hyperbola x\u00b2/20 - y\u00b2/24 =1. For such an intersection to exist, the line must not be tangent or non-intersecting. \n\nAlternatively, the condition for the line pr + qs =0 to intersect the hyperbola is that the distance from the center to the line divided by the appropriate term must satisfy some inequality, but perhaps it's easier to substitute.\n\nLet me parametrize p and q. Let me set variables such that p and q satisfy pr + qs =0. Let me solve for p in terms of q: p = - (qs)/r. Then substitute into hyperbola equation for p and q:\n\n[ ( ( - (qs)/r )\u00b2 ) ] /20 - q\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nSo (q\u00b2 s\u00b2)/(20 r\u00b2) - q\u00b2/24 =1,\n\nFactor out q\u00b2:\n\nq\u00b2 [ s\u00b2/(20 r\u00b2) - 1/24 ] =1,\n\nSo for this equation to have a real solution q, the term in brackets must be positive or negative such that the product can equal 1. Wait, let's see:\n\nLet me write:\n\nq\u00b2 = 1 / [ (s\u00b2)/(20 r\u00b2) - 1/24 ]\n\nFor this to be possible, the denominator must be positive (since q\u00b2 is non-negative). Therefore,\n\n(s\u00b2)/(20 r\u00b2) - 1/24 >0,\n\n=> (s\u00b2)/(20 r\u00b2) >1/24,\n\n=> 24 s\u00b2 >20 r\u00b2,\n\n=> 6 s\u00b2 >5 r\u00b2,\n\nSo 6s\u00b2 -5r\u00b2 >0.\n\nTherefore, given r and s, the condition is that 6 s\u00b2 -5 r\u00b2 >0.\n\nBut also, r and s must satisfy the hyperbola equation: r\u00b2/20 -s\u00b2/24=1,\n\nLet me write that as (r\u00b2)/20 - (s\u00b2)/24 =1,\n\nLet me express s\u00b2 from this equation:\n\ns\u00b2 =24*( (r\u00b2)/20 -1 ) = (24/20)r\u00b2 -24 = (6/5)r\u00b2 -24.\n\nSubstitute into the inequality 6s\u00b2 -5r\u00b2 >0,\n\n6*( (6/5 r\u00b2 -24) ) -5r\u00b2 >0,\n\nCompute:\n\n6*(6/5 r\u00b2) -6*24 -5r\u00b2,\n\n= (36/5 r\u00b2) -144 -5r\u00b2,\n\n= (36/5 -25/5)r\u00b2 -144,\n\n= (11/5)r\u00b2 -144 >0,\n\n=> (11/5) r\u00b2 >144,\n\n=> r\u00b2 > (144 *5)/11 =720/11 \u224865.4545.\n\nTherefore, for given r and s on the hyperbola (so r\u00b2/20 -s\u00b2/24=1), the inequality 6s\u00b2 -5r\u00b2 >0 requires that r\u00b2>720/11\u224865.4545.\n\nBut we also have s\u00b2 = (6/5)r\u00b2 -24,\n\nSo BD\u00b2 =4(r\u00b2 + s\u00b2)=4[ r\u00b2 + (6/5 r\u00b2 -24) ]=4[ (11/5 r\u00b2) -24 ]\n\nSo BD\u00b2=4*(11/5 r\u00b2 -24)= (44/5)r\u00b2 -96.\n\nWe need to minimize BD\u00b2, so since BD\u00b2 increases with r\u00b2, the minimal BD\u00b2 occurs when r\u00b2 is as small as possible, which is r\u00b2=720/11.\n\nPlugging r\u00b2=720/11 into BD\u00b2:\n\nBD\u00b2 = (44/5)*(720/11) -96.\n\nSimplify:\n\n44/5 *720/11 = (44/11)*(720/5)=4*(144)=576,\n\nTherefore BD\u00b2=576 -96=480.\n\nSo that's the same result as before. Therefore, the minimal BD\u00b2 is indeed 480, so the greatest real number less than BD\u00b2 for all such rhombi is 480. Since it's attainable, the answer is 480. Therefore, boxed answer is \\boxed{480}\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{480}\n\n\nGiven the hyperbola \\(\\frac{x^2}{20} - \\frac{y^2}{24} = 1\\) and a rhombus \\(ABCD\\) with diagonals intersecting at the origin, we need to find the greatest real number less than \\(BD^2\\) for all such rhombi.\n\n1. **Parametrization of Points**:\n   - Points \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) are \\((2\\sqrt{5} \\sec\\theta, 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan\\theta)\\) and \\((-2\\sqrt{5} \\sec\\theta, -2\\sqrt{6} \\tan\\theta)\\).\n   - Points \\(B\\) and \\(D\\) are \\((2\\sqrt{5} \\sec\\phi, 2\\sqrt{6} \\tan\\phi)\\) and \\((-2\\sqrt{5} \\sec\\phi, -2\\sqrt{6} \\tan\\phi)\\).\n\n2. **Perpendicular Diagonals**:\n   - The vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{AC}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{BD}\\) must be perpendicular, leading to the condition \\(80 \\sec\\theta \\sec\\phi + 96 \\tan\\theta \\tan\\phi = 0\\).\n   - Simplifying, we get \\(\\sin\\theta \\sin\\phi = -\\frac{5}{6}\\).\n\n3. **Expression for \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - \\(BD^2 = 4( (2\\sqrt{5} \\sec\\phi)^2 + (2\\sqrt{6} \\tan\\phi)^2 ) = 80 \\sec^2\\phi + 96 \\tan^2\\phi\\).\n   - Converting to trigonometric identities: \\(BD^2 = \\frac{80 + 96 \\sin^2\\phi}{\\cos^2\\phi}\\).\n\n4. **Minimizing \\(BD^2\\)**:\n   - Let \\(s = \\sin\\phi\\).
