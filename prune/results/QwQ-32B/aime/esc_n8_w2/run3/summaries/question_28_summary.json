      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I need to find the distance from the incenter (I think that's what point I is) of a tetrahedron to its faces. The tetrahedron has edges AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89. The answer needs to be in the form m\u221an/p, with m and p coprime and n square-free, then find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (distance from the incenter to each face) can be calculated by the formula 3 times the volume divided by the surface area. Wait, actually, in 3D, the formula for the inradius r is r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area. Let me confirm that. Yes, because the volume can be expressed as (1/3)*A*r, so solving for r gives r = 3V/A. So I need to compute the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.\n\nFirst, let me note the given edge lengths:\n\nAB = CD = \u221a41,\n\nAC = BD = \u221a80,\n\nBC = AD = \u221a89.\n\nHmm, this seems symmetric in some way. Maybe the tetrahedron has some symmetry? The edges opposite each other are equal. So AB and CD are opposite edges, AC and BD are opposite, BC and AD are opposite. So this is called a \"bisosceles\" tetrahedron? I think in such a tetrahedron, the opposite edges are equal, and it's known that they can be inscribed in a cube. Wait, maybe I can model this tetrahedron in a coordinate system where calculations are easier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for volume when all opposite edges are known. There is a formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given the lengths of all six edges. Let me recall that formula. \n\nI think the formula is based on the Cayley's formula for the volume of a tetrahedron. The volume squared is given by:\n\n(1/288) * | a^2 b^2 c^2 + ... | but maybe I need to recall the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use coordinates.\n\nSince the edges are symmetric, maybe I can set coordinates for the vertices such that calculations are manageable.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me think of a cube where the edges of the tetrahedron correspond to face diagonals or space diagonals. Wait, maybe if I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system such that the coordinates of the vertices are (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c), but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps another coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be considered as two triangles in different planes with corresponding edges equal. Wait, another idea: since in a bisosceles tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated as sqrt((a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + b^2 - d^2)...)/something? Hmm, maybe I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to set coordinates for the tetrahedron. Let me suppose that vertex A is at (0,0,0). Let me assign coordinates to the other points such that the edge lengths can be satisfied. Let me see.\n\nLet me suppose:\n\nLet me set point A at (0,0,0).\n\nLet me set point B at (x, 0, 0), so along the x-axis.\n\nPoint D is connected to A and C. Since AD = sqrt(89), so coordinates of D must satisfy the distance from A (0,0,0) is sqrt(89). Let me suppose D is at (0, y, z). Wait, but maybe this is getting too arbitrary. Alternatively, perhaps a better coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates of the four vertices are (\u00b1p, \u00b1q, \u00b1r) with some sign combinations, but maybe that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method I found in my mind: Let me denote the edge lengths as follows:\n\nLet edges AB = CD = l1 = sqrt(41),\n\nAC = BD = l2 = sqrt(80),\n\nAD = BC = l3 = sqrt(89).\n\nThis is a special tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Such a tetrahedron is called \"isohedral\" or \"disphenoid\". For a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated by the formula:\n\nVolume V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + b^2 - d^2)(a^2 + c^2 - d^2)(b^2 + c^2 - d^2) )) / (192 V?) Hmm, not sure. Wait, perhaps better formula.\n\nWait, maybe for a disphenoid, the volume is given by sqrt( ( (l1^2 + l2^2 - l3^2)(l1^2 + l2^2 - l3^2) ) / something? Maybe better to look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for volume in terms of coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me place vertex A at (0,0,0). Let me place vertex B at (a, 0, 0). Let me place vertex C at (b, c, 0). Since the tetrahedron is in 3D, vertex D will have coordinates (d, e, f). Then, we can set up equations based on the distances.\n\nGiven that AB = sqrt(41): Since AB is from (0,0,0) to (a,0,0), so length AB = a = sqrt(41). Therefore, a = sqrt(41). Wait, but actually, the problem says AB = sqrt(41). So yes, so point B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nNow, AC is sqrt(80). Point C is at (b, c, 0), so AC distance from A (0,0,0) is sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80). So b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80.\n\nSimilarly, AD is sqrt(89). Point D is at (d, e, f), so AD distance is sqrt(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) = sqrt(89). So d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 89.\n\nNow, BD is sqrt(80). BD is the distance from B (sqrt(41),0,0) to D (d,e,f). So sqrt( (d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 ) = sqrt(80). Squaring both sides: (d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 80.\n\nBut we also know that AD\u00b2 = d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 89. Therefore, substituting into the BD equation:\n\n(d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + (89 - d\u00b2 - e\u00b2 - f\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) Wait, no. Wait, BD squared is (d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 80. But since d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 89, substitute e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 89 - d\u00b2. So:\n\n(d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + (89 - d\u00b2) = 80\n\nExpand (d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 = d\u00b2 - 2 d sqrt(41) + 41. Then adding (89 - d\u00b2):\n\nd\u00b2 - 2 d sqrt(41) + 41 + 89 - d\u00b2 = ( -2 d sqrt(41) ) + 130 = 80\n\nSo -2 d sqrt(41) + 130 = 80 \u2192 -2 d sqrt(41) = -50 \u2192 d sqrt(41) = 25 \u2192 d = 25 / sqrt(41)\n\nHmm, so d = 25 / sqrt(41). Let me rationalize that: 25 sqrt(41)/41. So d = (25 sqrt(41))/41. Okay.\n\nNow, moving on. Let's see if we can find coordinates for point C. Let me consider BC = sqrt(89). The distance from B (sqrt(41),0,0) to C (b,c,0) is sqrt( (b - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ) = sqrt(89). So:\n\n(b - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nBut we already have from AC: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80. So subtract the two equations:\n\n[ (b - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ] - [ b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ] = 89 - 80 \u21d2 (b\u00b2 - 2 b sqrt(41) + 41) - b\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2 -2 b sqrt(41) + 41 = 9 \u21d2 -2 b sqrt(41) = -32 \u21d2 b sqrt(41) = 16 \u21d2 b = 16 / sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41))/41.\n\nSo b = 16 sqrt(41)/41.\n\nThen from AC's equation: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80. Let me compute b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 = (256 * 41)/ (41\u00b2) )? Wait, no. Wait, b = 16 / sqrt(41), so b\u00b2 = (256)/(41). Therefore,\n\nc\u00b2 = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 -256)/41 = (3280 -256)/41 = 3024 /41. Hmm, so c = sqrt(3024/41). Let me see if that simplifies.\n\n3024 divided by 41? 41*73 is 2993, 41*74=2993 +41=3034. Hmm, so 3024 is between 41*73 and 41*74. So it's not a whole number. Hmm, maybe that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error here. Let me check:\n\nWait, BC is sqrt(89). The coordinates of point C are (b, c, 0). The coordinates of B are (sqrt(41), 0,0). So the distance squared between B and C is (b - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89. And AC squared is b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =80. So subtract those equations:\n\n(b - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =89 -80 \u21d2 -2 b sqrt(41) +41 =9 \u21d2 -2b sqrt(41) = -32 \u21d2 b sqrt(41)=16 \u21d2 b =16/sqrt(41). That's correct. Then b squared is (256)/(41). So c squared is 80 -256/41. Let me compute 80 as 80*41/41 = 3280/41. So 3280 -256 = 3024. So c squared is 3024/41. So c is sqrt(3024/41). Let me see if 3024 can be divided by 41? 41*73=2993, so 3024-2993=31, so no. So c is sqrt(3024/41). Maybe leave it as is for now.\n\nNow, moving on to coordinates of D. We already have d =25/sqrt(41), and d squared is 625/41. Since d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =89, so e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =89 -625/41 = (89*41 -625)/41. Let me compute 89*41: 90*41=3690, minus 1*41=3690-41=3649. 3649 -625 = 3024. So e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 3024/41.\n\nSo e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 3024/41. Hmm, that's the same as c squared. Interesting. Not sure if that's useful.\n\nNow, let's consider the other edges. CD is sqrt(41). The distance between C (b,c,0) and D (d,e,f) should be sqrt(41). Let's compute that squared:\n\n(d - b)^2 + (e - c)^2 + (f - 0)^2 =41.\n\nWe can plug in d =25/sqrt(41), b =16/sqrt(41). So d - b = (25 -16)/sqrt(41) =9/sqrt(41). Therefore, (d -b)^2 =81/(41).\n\nThen (e -c)^2 + f^2 = (e^2 - 2ec +c^2) + f^2 = (e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) + c\u00b2 - 2ec. We know e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =3024/41, and c\u00b2 =3024/41. So this becomes (3024/41 + 3024/41) -2ec = (6048/41) - 2ec. Therefore, the total squared distance CD is:\n\n81/41 + 6048/41 - 2ec = (81 + 6048)/41 - 2ec = 6129/41 - 2ec =41 (since CD squared is 41).\n\nSo 6129/41 - 2ec =41.\n\nCompute 6129 divided by 41. Let me see, 41*150=6150. So 6129 is 6150-21, so 6129/41 =150 -21/41= (150*41 -21)/41? Wait, no, just 6129 divided by 41. Let me compute 41*149 = 41*(150-1)=6150 -41=6109. 6129-6109=20. So 6129/41 =149 +20/41. So 149 +20/41 \u2248 149.4878.\n\nBut 6129/41 -2ec =41 \u21d2 2ec =6129/41 -41 = (6129 -41*41)/41. Let me compute 41*41=1681. 6129 -1681 = 4448. So 2ec =4448 /41 \u21d2 ec =2224/41.\n\nHmm, okay. So ec =2224/41. Let me note that.\n\nNow, moving on, the other edge is AD = sqrt(89), but we already considered that. Also, BD is sqrt(80), which was used earlier. The other edges: AC is sqrt(80), which was set. BC is sqrt(89), which was set. So the only remaining edges to consider are BD, CD, and DA. Wait, perhaps I need to check another edge? Wait, BD is given as sqrt(80). Let me check BD. BD is from B (sqrt(41),0,0) to D (d,e,f). The coordinates of D are (25/sqrt(41), e, f). Wait, d was 25/sqrt(41). So BD squared is (d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2. Let's compute that.\n\nd - sqrt(41) =25/sqrt(41) - sqrt(41) = (25 -41)/sqrt(41) = (-16)/sqrt(41). Squared is 256/41. Then e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 is 3024/41. So total BD squared is 256/41 +3024/41 = (256 +3024)/41=3280/41. But 3280 divided by 41: 41*80=3280. So 3280/41=80. Perfect, so that checks out. Good.\n\nNow, the other edge is CD = sqrt(41). Which we already used in the previous equation, so that's okay.\n\nNow, perhaps I need to find coordinates for point D's e and f. Since we have e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =3024/41 and ec =2224/41.\n\nWait, but we have variables e and f. Let me see. Let me denote variables e and f. Let me see if I can express e in terms of f or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can set e = (2224)/(41 c). Since ec =2224/41, so e = (2224)/(41 c). But c squared is 3024/41, so c = sqrt(3024/41). Hmm, this might get complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can set coordinates such that point D is in the z-axis? Wait, perhaps another coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the volume via the scalar triple product once coordinates are set. Let me see.\n\nWe have coordinates for points A, B, C, D:\n\nA: (0,0,0)\n\nB: (sqrt(41),0,0)\n\nC: (16/sqrt(41), sqrt(3024/41), 0). Wait, but c is sqrt(3024/41). Wait, but actually c squared is 3024/41, so c is sqrt(3024/41). Let me compute sqrt(3024). Hmm, 3024 divided by 16 is 189, so sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189). 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21). Therefore sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21). Therefore sqrt(3024/41)= (12 sqrt(21))/sqrt(41). So c =12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). Similarly, sqrt(3024/41)=12 sqrt(21/41). Hmm, okay. So point C has coordinates ( (16 sqrt(41))/41 , (12 sqrt(21*41))/41 ??? Wait, let me recast coordinates properly.\n\nWait, perhaps better to keep variables as fractions. Let me note:\n\nCoordinates:\n\nA: (0,0,0)\n\nB: (sqrt(41),0,0)\n\nC: (16/sqrt(41), sqrt(3024/41), 0). Let me write sqrt(3024/41) as sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). Since sqrt(3024)=sqrt(144*21)=12 sqrt(21). So sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)=12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). Therefore, C is (16/sqrt(41), 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41), 0).\n\nPoint D: (25/sqrt(41), e, f). With e and f such that e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =3024/41, and e*c =2224/41. Wait, c is 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). So:\n\ne*(12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) =2224/41 \u21d2 e= (2224/41) / (12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) ) = (2224 /41 ) * (sqrt(41)/ (12 sqrt(21)) ) = (2224 sqrt(41) ) / (41 *12 sqrt(21)) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n2224 divided by 41: 41*54=2214, so 2224-2214=10. So 2224=41*54 +10. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, 2224 divided by 4 is 556, so 2224=4*556, and 41 is prime. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 2224 divided by 41. 41*54 = 2214. 2224 -2214=10. So 2224=41*54 +10. So e= ( (41*54 +10) sqrt(41) ) / (41*12 sqrt(21)) )\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps since the problem is symmetric, the coordinates can be arranged so that the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, so that the inradius can be calculated more easily.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using another method. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the volume can be found by another formula.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid (a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal), the volume is given by (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - d\u00b2) )) / (something). Wait, actually, let me recall that formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the volume of a disphenoid is Volume = (sqrt( (ab)^2 - (cd)^2 )) / something? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, here's a method from the internet (but since I can't access it, I need to recall).\n\nAlternatively, the volume of a disphenoid can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * sqrt( (k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2)/2 - (l1^2 + l2^2 + l3^2)/4 ) )\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a tetrahedron with edges in pairs.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the tetrahedron as two congruent triangles folded together. Since opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\", so all its faces are congruent? Wait, not necessarily. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Is that the case here? Let me check the edge lengths.\n\nThe faces are:\n\nFace ABC: edges AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89.\n\nFace ABD: edges AB=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80.\n\nFace ACD: edges AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41.\n\nFace BCD: edges BC=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41.\n\nSo yes, all four faces have the same three edge lengths: \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So they are congruent triangles. Therefore, the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with congruent faces, so it's a kind of regular tetrahedron but not regular, but with congruent faces.\n\nTherefore, in such a tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated using the formula for a disphenoid:\n\nVolume V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - d\u00b2) )) / (something). Wait, perhaps I need to look for another formula.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent triangles, the area of each face is the same. Let me compute the area of one face first, then multiply by 4 to get the surface area.\n\nCompute the area of triangle ABC with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. Let's use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter: s = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2. Hmm, that might be messy, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for area in terms of sides:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nSo let me compute for triangle ABC with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(a + b + c) = \u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89,\n\n(-a + b + c) = -\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89,\n\n(a - b + c) = \u221a41 - \u221a80 + \u221a89,\n\n(a + b - c) = \u221a41 + \u221a80 - \u221a89.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe compute numerically? Let me compute each term numerically.\n\nFirst, approximate the square roots:\n\n\u221a41 \u22486.4031,\n\n\u221a80\u22488.9443,\n\n\u221a89\u22489.4336.\n\nSo:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2 \u2248 (6.4031 +8.9443 +9.4336)/2 \u2248 (24.781)/2 \u224812.3905.\n\nThen area = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )\n\nCompute s - a \u224812.3905 -6.4031\u22485.9874,\n\ns - b \u224812.3905 -8.9443\u22483.4462,\n\ns - c\u224812.3905 -9.4336\u22482.9569.\n\nThen the product inside sqrt is:\n\n12.3905 *5.9874 *3.4462 *2.9569 \u2248 Hmm, this is going to be tedious. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for area in terms of vectors. Wait, maybe using coordinates would be better here, even though it's tedious.\n\nAlternatively, since all four faces are congruent, the surface area A_total = 4*A_face.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to compute the volume. Let's think again of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Cayley-Menger determinant for the volume. That might be a systematic way.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:\n\nV = (1/12) * sqrt( | CM | ), where CM is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\n[ 0   1        1        1        1     ]\n\n[ 1   0      AB\u00b2     AC\u00b2     AD\u00b2   ]\n\n[ 1  AB\u00b2     0      BC\u00b2     BD\u00b2   ]\n\n[ 1  AC\u00b2    BC\u00b2      0      CD\u00b2   ]\n\n[ 1  AD\u00b2    BD\u00b2     CD\u00b2      0     ]\n\nSo let's write that out with the given edge lengths.\n\nGiven:\n\nAB = CD = sqrt(41) \u21d2 AB\u00b2=41, CD\u00b2=41,\n\nAC = BD = sqrt(80) \u21d2 AC\u00b2=80, BD\u00b2=80,\n\nAD = BC = sqrt(89) \u21d2 AD\u00b2=89, BC\u00b2=89.\n\nSo the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1,41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nRow 3: [1,80,89, 0,41]\n\nRow 4: [1,89,80,41,0]\n\nWe need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix, then take the square root divided by 288 (since 12\u00b2=144, and 1/12 * sqrt(det) = V \u21d2 det = (12 V)^2 \u21d2 sqrt(det) =12 V \u21d2 V= sqrt(det)/12. Wait, actually the formula is V\u00b2 = (det)/(288\u00b2). Wait, let me check:\n\nThe formula is V^2 = (1/288)*CM determinant. So V = sqrt( CM determinant ) / (12 * sqrt(2))? Wait, perhaps better to recall the exact formula.\n\nWait, according to the Cayley-Menger determinant formula, the volume V of a tetrahedron is given by:\n\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{ \\begin{vmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\\\\n1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 & BD^2 \\\\\n1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0 & CD^2 \\\\\n1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}}}{288}\n\nWait, so the determinant is divided by 288 and then square-rooted, so V = sqrt( determinant ) / (288)^{1/2} * something? Wait no, actually the formula is:\n\nV^2 = determinant / 288\u00b2, so V = sqrt(determinant)/288 ?\n\nWait, actually, let me check the exact formula. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron is a 5x5 determinant, and the volume is given by:\n\nV = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\text{det} }{288} }\n\nSo V = sqrt( determinant ) / sqrt(288). Since sqrt(288)=12*sqrt(2), so V= sqrt(determinant)/(12 sqrt(2)). Wait, perhaps better to just compute the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the determinant step by step. This might take time but is systematic.\n\nLet me denote the Cayley-Menger matrix as M:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1,41, 0,89,80\n\nRow 3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow 4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nWe need to compute determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Computing a 5x5 determinant is tedious, but perhaps there is symmetry we can exploit.\n\nLooking at the matrix, the matrix is symmetric except for the first row and column. Let me see if we can use some properties or row operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote the matrix as follows:\n\nLet me write the matrix entries as M[i][j] for rows 0-4 and columns 0-4.\n\nNote that the first row is [0,1,1,1,1], and the first column is [0,1,1,1,1]^T.\n\nLet me subtract row 1 from rows 2, 3, 4. Wait, but determinant calculations can be done with row operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant of M is:\n\n0 * minor(0,0) - 1 * minor(0,1) + 1 * minor(0,2) -1 * minor(0,3) +1 * minor(0,4)\n\nBut since the first element is 0, that term drops out. So:\n\ndet(M) = -1 * minor(0,1) +1 * minor(0,2) -1 * minor(0,3) +1 * minor(0,4)\n\nWhere minor(0,j) is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row 0 and column j.\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst, minor(0,1): remove column 1. So the matrix becomes:\n\nRow0 (original row1): [1,41,80,89]\n\nRow1 (original row2): [1,0,89,80]\n\nRow2 (original row3): [1,89,0,41]\n\nRow3 (original row4): [1,80,41,0]\n\nWait, actually, removing column 1 (the second column, since columns are 0-4), so columns 0,2,3,4.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nOriginal columns after removing column 1 (which is the second column):\n\nColumns 0,2,3,4.\n\nSo for minor(0,1):\n\nThe rows are rows 1-4 (since we removed row0), and columns 0,2,3,4.\n\nSo entries:\n\nRow1 (original row1): columns 0,2,3,4: [1, 41,80,89]\n\nRow2 (original row2): [1, 0,89,80]\n\nRow3 (original row3): [1,89,0,41]\n\nRow4 (original row4): [1,80,41,0]\n\nSimilarly, minor(0,2): remove column2. So columns 0,1,3,4.\n\nSo:\n\nRow1: [1,0,80,89]\n\nRow2: [1,41,89,80]\n\nRow3: [1,80,0,41]\n\nRow4: [1,89,41,0]\n\nSimilarly for others, but this is getting very involved. Maybe there is symmetry here.\n\nAlternatively, note that the matrix after removing first row and column j may have some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the determinant numerically. Since all the entries are integers except the first row and column, but actually, in the given edge lengths, all the squared edges are integers. Wait, AB\u00b2 etc. are integers. So the entire Cayley-Menger matrix has integer entries except the first row and column which have 0,1, etc. So the determinant is an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern or exploit the symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a cube. Since in a disphenoid with opposite edges equal, sometimes they can be placed in a cube with vertices at opposite corners.\n\nWait, here's an idea: If we can place the tetrahedron so that its vertices are alternated vertices of a cube. For example, in a cube with edge length k, the space diagonal is k\u221a3, face diagonals are k\u221a2. Suppose the edges of the tetrahedron correspond to face diagonals and edges of the cube.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose the cube has edge length L. Then, the face diagonals are L\u221a2, and the space diagonals are L\u221a3. Suppose the tetrahedron has edges of lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). These need to correspond to combinations of the cube's edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the edges of the tetrahedron are combinations of the cube's edges. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the tetrahedron edges correspond to:\n\nAB = sqrt( (a)^2 + (b)^2 ), \n\nAC = sqrt( (a)^2 + (c)^2 ),\n\nAD = sqrt( (b)^2 + (c)^2 ),\n\nand similarly for the opposite edges. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that the tetrahedron is formed by four body diagonals of a cuboid. Wait, a cuboid with edge lengths p, q, r. Then the face diagonals are sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), sqrt(p\u00b2 + r\u00b2), sqrt(q\u00b2 + r\u00b2), and the space diagonal sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2). But in our case, the edges of the tetrahedron are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me see:\n\nSuppose the edges of the tetrahedron correspond to the three face diagonals of a cuboid. Let me suppose that:\n\nAB = sqrt( p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 ) = sqrt(41),\n\nAC = sqrt( p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 ) = sqrt(80),\n\nAD = sqrt( q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 ) = sqrt(89).\n\nThen, solving for p, q, r:\n\nLet me set:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =41,\n\np\u00b2 + r\u00b2=80,\n\nq\u00b2 + r\u00b2=89.\n\nLet me subtract first equation from the second: r\u00b2 - q\u00b2 =80 -41=39,\n\nThird equation: q\u00b2 + r\u00b2=89.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nLet me denote x = q\u00b2, y = r\u00b2.\n\nThen:\n\ny -x =39,\n\nx + y =89.\n\nAdding both equations: 2y =128 \u21d2 y=64 \u21d2 x=89-64=25.\n\nThus, q\u00b2=25 \u21d2 q=5,\n\nr\u00b2=64 \u21d2r=8,\n\nThen from first equation, p\u00b2 +25=41 \u21d2 p\u00b2=16 \u21d2 p=4.\n\nTherefore, the cuboid has edges 4,5,8.\n\nSo the cuboid with edges 4,5,8. Then, the tetrahedron can be formed by the four body diagonals? Wait, no, the edges of the tetrahedron would be the face diagonals of the cuboid, which are sqrt(4\u00b2+5\u00b2)=sqrt(41), sqrt(4\u00b2+8\u00b2)=sqrt(80), sqrt(5\u00b2+8\u00b2)=sqrt(89). So yes! The tetrahedron is formed by the three face diagonals of a cuboid with edges 4,5,8. Therefore, the tetrahedron can be embedded in such a cuboid, with vertices at opposite corners of each face. \n\nTherefore, the volume of the tetrahedron can be calculated as 1/3 of the volume of the cuboid? Wait, no. Wait, actually, in such a case, the tetrahedron is formed by four non-adjacent vertices of the cuboid. Wait, actually, in a cuboid, selecting two opposite vertices along three edges would form a tetrahedron. Wait, perhaps the volume is 1/3 * base area * height, but maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the cuboid has volume 4*5*8=160. The tetrahedron is a part of this cuboid. In a cuboid, the tetrahedron formed by four alternate vertices (i.e., choosing one vertex and then the three opposite vertices on each face) has a volume equal to 1/3 of the cuboid's volume. Wait, let me think.\n\nActually, the cuboid can be divided into 6 tetrahedrons each congruent to this one? Not sure. Wait, in a cube, the space diagonal divides it into two tetrahedrons each with volume 1/3 of the cube. Maybe in a cuboid, similarly, the volume of the tetrahedron formed by four vertices (each pair connected by an edge of the tetrahedron being a face diagonal) is 1/3 of the cuboid's volume?\n\nWait, let me check with coordinates. Let me place the cuboid with edges 4,5,8 along the axes. Let me set vertex A at (0,0,0). Then the opposite vertices for the face diagonals would be:\n\nAB: suppose AB is the face diagonal on the 4x5 face. So point B would be (4,5,0).\n\nAC is the face diagonal on the 4x8 face: point C at (4,0,8).\n\nAD is the face diagonal on the 5x8 face: point D at (0,5,8).\n\nWait, then edges:\n\nAB: distance from (0,0,0) to (4,5,0) is sqrt(16+25)=sqrt(41). Good.\n\nAC: to (4,0,8): sqrt(16 +0 +64)=sqrt(80). Good.\n\nAD: to (0,5,8): sqrt(0+25+64)=sqrt(89). Good.\n\nThen, what is BC? Between (4,5,0) and (4,0,8):\n\ndx=0, dy=-5, dz=8. So sqrt(0 +25 +64)=sqrt(89). Which matches BC= sqrt(89).\n\nBD: between (4,5,0) and (0,5,8):\n\ndx=-4, dy=0, dz=8. sqrt(16+0+64)=sqrt(80). Good.\n\nCD: between (4,0,8) and (0,5,8):\n\ndx=-4, dy=5, dz=0. sqrt(16+25)=sqrt(41). Perfect. So yes, this works.\n\nTherefore, the tetrahedron is indeed embedded in a 4x5x8 cuboid, with vertices at (0,0,0), (4,5,0), (4,0,8), (0,5,8). The volume of this tetrahedron can be calculated using the scalar triple product.\n\nLet me compute vectors AB, AC, AD:\n\nVector AB = (4,5,0),\n\nVector AC = (4,0,8),\n\nVector AD = (0,5,8).\n\nThe volume is (1/6)* | scalar triple product of AB, AC, AD |.\n\nCompute the scalar triple product AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst compute AC \u00d7 AD:\n\nAC = (4,0,8),\n\nAD = (0,5,8).\n\nCross product:\n\ni  j  k\n\n4  0  8\n\n0  5  8\n\n= i*(0*8 -8*5) - j*(4*8 -8*0) +k*(4*5 -0*0)\n\n= i*(0 -40) - j*(32 -0) +k*(20 -0)\n\n= (-40, -32, 20)\n\nThen AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD) = (4,5,0) \u22c5 (-40, -32, 20) = 4*(-40) +5*(-32) +0*20 = -160 -160 +0 = -320.\n\nAbsolute value is 320. Volume is (1/6)*320 = 160/3 \u224853.333...\n\nWait, but the cuboid's volume is 4*5*8=160. So the tetrahedron's volume is 160/3, which is 1/3 of the cuboid's volume. That makes sense, similar to the cube case.\n\nTherefore, Volume V = 160/3.\n\nOkay, so that's a relief! So Volume is 160/3.\n\nNow, the surface area. Since all four faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nLet me compute the area using Heron's formula for triangle with sides a=sqrt(41), b=sqrt(80), c=sqrt(89).\n\nFirst compute semi-perimeter s=(sqrt(41)+sqrt(80)+sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula might be messy here. Alternatively, since we have coordinates for the cuboid, let me compute the area of one face using coordinates.\n\nTake face ABC with points A(0,0,0), B(4,5,0), C(4,0,8).\n\nVectors AB=(4,5,0), AC=(4,0,8).\n\nThe area is (1/2)*|AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nCompute cross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\nAB=(4,5,0),\n\nAC=(4,0,8).\n\nCross product:\n\ni  j  k\n\n4  5  0\n\n4  0  8\n\n= i*(5*8 -0*0) - j*(4*8 -0*4) +k*(4*0 -5*4)\n\n= i*(40) - j*(32) +k*(-20)\n\nSo cross product vector is (40, -32, -20).\n\nThe magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 +400 = 3024.\n\nTherefore, magnitude is sqrt(3024)=sqrt(144*21)=12*sqrt(21). Therefore, area is (1/2)*12*sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). Since there are four faces, total surface area A=4*6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, the inradius r = 3V / A = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (20)/ (3 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nr = 20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/(3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63. Wait, but rationalizing the denominator:\n\n20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/(3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63. Since 20 and 63 have a common factor of 1 (since 20 is 2\u00b2\u00d75, 63 is 3\u00b2\u00d77). So 20 and 63 are coprime? 20 and 63 share no common prime factors. Yes, GCD(20,63)=1. So the simplified form is (20\u221a21)/63. Therefore m=20, n=21, p=63. So m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst, Volume is 160/3.\n\nSurface area: Each face area is 6\u221a21, four faces gives 24\u221a21.\n\nThen inradius r = 3V/A = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160/(24\u221a21) = simplifies numerator and denominator by 8: 20/(3\u221a21). Then rationalizing the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21: (20\u221a21)/(3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63. Yes, so m=20, n=21, p=63. 20 and 63 are coprime (since 20 factors 2,5; 63 factors 3,7). 21 is square-free. So the answer is 20 +21 +63=104.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check the cross product calculation again for the area.\n\nFor face ABC, vectors AB=(4,5,0), AC=(4,0,8). The cross product is (40, -32, -20). The magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 +400 = 1600+1024=2624+400=3024. sqrt(3024)=sqrt(144\u00d721)=12\u221a21. So area is half that: 6\u221a21. That's correct.\n\nSurface area total 24\u221a21. Volume 160/3. So 3V/A = (3*(160/3))/(24\u221a21)= 160/(24\u221a21)=20/(3\u221a21)=20\u221a21/63. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, m+n+p=20+21+63=104.\n\nBut let me just check if I made any miscalculations in the cuboid approach. Let me confirm the volume via coordinates.\n\nYes, using the scalar triple product, the volume was 160/3. The coordinates were set as A(0,0,0), B(4,5,0), C(4,0,8), D(0,5,8). The vectors AB, AC, AD are correct, and the cross and dot products led to 160/3. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the cuboid volume 4\u00d75\u00d78=160, and the tetrahedron is 1/3 of that, so that also gives 160/3. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the inradius is indeed 20\u221a21/63. Thus the answer is 20+21+63=104. So the final answer is 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I need to find the distance from the incenter (I think that's what point I is) of a tetrahedron to its faces. The tetrahedron has edges AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89. The answer needs to be in the form m\u221an/p, with m and p coprime and n square-free, then find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I should recall that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (distance from the incenter to each face) can be calculated by the formula 3 times the volume divided by the surface area. Wait, actually, in 3D, the formula for the inradius r is r = 3V / A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area. Let me confirm that. Yes, because the volume can be expressed as (1/3)*A*r, so solving for r gives r = 3V/A. So I need to compute the volume and the surface area of this tetrahedron.\n\nFirst, let me note the given edge lengths:\n\nAB = CD = \u221a41,\n\nAC = BD = \u221a80,\n\nBC = AD = \u221a89.\n\nHmm, this seems symmetric in some way. Maybe the tetrahedron has some symmetry? The edges opposite each other are equal. So AB and CD are opposite edges, AC and BD are opposite, BC and AD are opposite. So this is called a \"bisosceles\" tetrahedron? I think in such a tetrahedron, the opposite edges are equal, and it's known that they can be inscribed in a cube. Wait, maybe I can model this tetrahedron in a coordinate system where calculations are easier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for volume when all opposite edges are known. There is a formula for the volume of a tetrahedron given the lengths of all six edges. Let me recall that formula. \n\nI think the formula is based on the Cayley's formula for the volume of a tetrahedron. The volume squared is given by:\n\n(1/288) * | a^2 b^2 c^2 + ... | but maybe I need to recall the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use coordinates.\n\nSince the edges are symmetric, maybe I can set coordinates for the vertices such that calculations are manageable.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the vertices. Let me think of a cube where the edges of the tetrahedron correspond to face diagonals or space diagonals. Wait, maybe if I can place the tetrahedron in a coordinate system such that the coordinates of the vertices are (0,0,0), (a,0,0), (0,b,0), (0,0,c), but not sure. Alternatively, perhaps another coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps the tetrahedron can be considered as two triangles in different planes with corresponding edges equal. Wait, another idea: since in a bisosceles tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated as sqrt((a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + b^2 - d^2)...)/something? Hmm, maybe I need a better approach.\n\nAlternatively, let me try to set coordinates for the tetrahedron. Let me suppose that vertex A is at (0,0,0). Let me assign coordinates to the other points such that the edge lengths can be satisfied. Let me see.\n\nLet me suppose:\n\nLet me set point A at (0,0,0).\n\nLet me set point B at (x, 0, 0), so along the x-axis.\n\nPoint D is connected to A and C. Since AD = sqrt(89), so coordinates of D must satisfy the distance from A (0,0,0) is sqrt(89). Let me suppose D is at (0, y, z). Wait, but maybe this is getting too arbitrary. Alternatively, perhaps a better coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that in a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, it can be embedded in a coordinate system where the coordinates of the four vertices are (\u00b1p, \u00b1q, \u00b1r) with some sign combinations, but maybe that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, here's a method I found in my mind: Let me denote the edge lengths as follows:\n\nLet edges AB = CD = l1 = sqrt(41),\n\nAC = BD = l2 = sqrt(80),\n\nAD = BC = l3 = sqrt(89).\n\nThis is a special tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal. Such a tetrahedron is called \"isohedral\" or \"disphenoid\". For a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated by the formula:\n\nVolume V = (sqrt( (a^2 + b^2 - c^2)(a^2 + b^2 - d^2)(a^2 + c^2 - d^2)(b^2 + c^2 - d^2) )) / (192 V?) Hmm, not sure. Wait, perhaps better formula.\n\nWait, maybe for a disphenoid, the volume is given by sqrt( ( (l1^2 + l2^2 - l3^2)(l1^2 + l2^2 - l3^2) ) / something? Maybe better to look for another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the formula for volume in terms of coordinates. Let me try to assign coordinates to the vertices.\n\nLet me place vertex A at (0,0,0). Let me place vertex B at (a, 0, 0). Let me place vertex C at (b, c, 0). Since the tetrahedron is in 3D, vertex D will have coordinates (d, e, f). Then, we can set up equations based on the distances.\n\nGiven that AB = sqrt(41): Since AB is from (0,0,0) to (a,0,0), so length AB = a = sqrt(41). Therefore, a = sqrt(41). Wait, but actually, the problem says AB = sqrt(41). So yes, so point B is at (sqrt(41), 0, 0).\n\nNow, AC is sqrt(80). Point C is at (b, c, 0), so AC distance from A (0,0,0) is sqrt(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) = sqrt(80). So b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80.\n\nSimilarly, AD is sqrt(89). Point D is at (d, e, f), so AD distance is sqrt(d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) = sqrt(89). So d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 89.\n\nNow, BD is sqrt(80). BD is the distance from B (sqrt(41),0,0) to D (d,e,f). So sqrt( (d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 ) = sqrt(80). Squaring both sides: (d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 80.\n\nBut we also know that AD\u00b2 = d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 89. Therefore, substituting into the BD equation:\n\n(d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + (89 - d\u00b2 - e\u00b2 - f\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) Wait, no. Wait, BD squared is (d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 80. But since d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 89, substitute e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 89 - d\u00b2. So:\n\n(d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + (89 - d\u00b2) = 80\n\nExpand (d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 = d\u00b2 - 2 d sqrt(41) + 41. Then adding (89 - d\u00b2):\n\nd\u00b2 - 2 d sqrt(41) + 41 + 89 - d\u00b2 = ( -2 d sqrt(41) ) + 130 = 80\n\nSo -2 d sqrt(41) + 130 = 80 \u2192 -2 d sqrt(41) = -50 \u2192 d sqrt(41) = 25 \u2192 d = 25 / sqrt(41)\n\nHmm, so d = 25 / sqrt(41). Let me rationalize that: 25 sqrt(41)/41. So d = (25 sqrt(41))/41. Okay.\n\nNow, moving on. Let's see if we can find coordinates for point C. Let me consider BC = sqrt(89). The distance from B (sqrt(41),0,0) to C (b,c,0) is sqrt( (b - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ) = sqrt(89). So:\n\n(b - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89.\n\nBut we already have from AC: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80. So subtract the two equations:\n\n[ (b - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ] - [ b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 ] = 89 - 80 \u21d2 (b\u00b2 - 2 b sqrt(41) + 41) - b\u00b2 = 9 \u21d2 -2 b sqrt(41) + 41 = 9 \u21d2 -2 b sqrt(41) = -32 \u21d2 b sqrt(41) = 16 \u21d2 b = 16 / sqrt(41) = (16 sqrt(41))/41.\n\nSo b = 16 sqrt(41)/41.\n\nThen from AC's equation: b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 80. Let me compute b\u00b2:\n\nb\u00b2 = (256 * 41)/ (41\u00b2) )? Wait, no. Wait, b = 16 / sqrt(41), so b\u00b2 = (256)/(41). Therefore,\n\nc\u00b2 = 80 - 256/41 = (80*41 -256)/41 = (3280 -256)/41 = 3024 /41. Hmm, so c = sqrt(3024/41). Let me see if that simplifies.\n\n3024 divided by 41? 41*73 is 2993, 41*74=2993 +41=3034. Hmm, so 3024 is between 41*73 and 41*74. So it's not a whole number. Hmm, maybe that's okay.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made an error here. Let me check:\n\nWait, BC is sqrt(89). The coordinates of point C are (b, c, 0). The coordinates of B are (sqrt(41), 0,0). So the distance squared between B and C is (b - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + c\u00b2 = 89. And AC squared is b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 =80. So subtract those equations:\n\n(b - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - (b\u00b2 + c\u00b2) =89 -80 \u21d2 -2 b sqrt(41) +41 =9 \u21d2 -2b sqrt(41) = -32 \u21d2 b sqrt(41)=16 \u21d2 b =16/sqrt(41). That's correct. Then b squared is (256)/(41). So c squared is 80 -256/41. Let me compute 80 as 80*41/41 = 3280/41. So 3280 -256 = 3024. So c squared is 3024/41. So c is sqrt(3024/41). Let me see if 3024 can be divided by 41? 41*73=2993, so 3024-2993=31, so no. So c is sqrt(3024/41). Maybe leave it as is for now.\n\nNow, moving on to coordinates of D. We already have d =25/sqrt(41), and d squared is 625/41. Since d\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =89, so e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =89 -625/41 = (89*41 -625)/41. Let me compute 89*41: 90*41=3690, minus 1*41=3690-41=3649. 3649 -625 = 3024. So e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 3024/41.\n\nSo e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 = 3024/41. Hmm, that's the same as c squared. Interesting. Not sure if that's useful.\n\nNow, let's consider the other edges. CD is sqrt(41). The distance between C (b,c,0) and D (d,e,f) should be sqrt(41). Let's compute that squared:\n\n(d - b)^2 + (e - c)^2 + (f - 0)^2 =41.\n\nWe can plug in d =25/sqrt(41), b =16/sqrt(41). So d - b = (25 -16)/sqrt(41) =9/sqrt(41). Therefore, (d -b)^2 =81/(41).\n\nThen (e -c)^2 + f^2 = (e^2 - 2ec +c^2) + f^2 = (e\u00b2 + f\u00b2) + c\u00b2 - 2ec. We know e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =3024/41, and c\u00b2 =3024/41. So this becomes (3024/41 + 3024/41) -2ec = (6048/41) - 2ec. Therefore, the total squared distance CD is:\n\n81/41 + 6048/41 - 2ec = (81 + 6048)/41 - 2ec = 6129/41 - 2ec =41 (since CD squared is 41).\n\nSo 6129/41 - 2ec =41.\n\nCompute 6129 divided by 41. Let me see, 41*150=6150. So 6129 is 6150-21, so 6129/41 =150 -21/41= (150*41 -21)/41? Wait, no, just 6129 divided by 41. Let me compute 41*149 = 41*(150-1)=6150 -41=6109. 6129-6109=20. So 6129/41 =149 +20/41. So 149 +20/41 \u2248 149.4878.\n\nBut 6129/41 -2ec =41 \u21d2 2ec =6129/41 -41 = (6129 -41*41)/41. Let me compute 41*41=1681. 6129 -1681 = 4448. So 2ec =4448 /41 \u21d2 ec =2224/41.\n\nHmm, okay. So ec =2224/41. Let me note that.\n\nNow, moving on, the other edge is AD = sqrt(89), but we already considered that. Also, BD is sqrt(80), which was used earlier. The other edges: AC is sqrt(80), which was set. BC is sqrt(89), which was set. So the only remaining edges to consider are BD, CD, and DA. Wait, perhaps I need to check another edge? Wait, BD is given as sqrt(80). Let me check BD. BD is from B (sqrt(41),0,0) to D (d,e,f). The coordinates of D are (25/sqrt(41), e, f). Wait, d was 25/sqrt(41). So BD squared is (d - sqrt(41))\u00b2 + e\u00b2 + f\u00b2. Let's compute that.\n\nd - sqrt(41) =25/sqrt(41) - sqrt(41) = (25 -41)/sqrt(41) = (-16)/sqrt(41). Squared is 256/41. Then e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 is 3024/41. So total BD squared is 256/41 +3024/41 = (256 +3024)/41=3280/41. But 3280 divided by 41: 41*80=3280. So 3280/41=80. Perfect, so that checks out. Good.\n\nNow, the other edge is CD = sqrt(41). Which we already used in the previous equation, so that's okay.\n\nNow, perhaps I need to find coordinates for point D's e and f. Since we have e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =3024/41 and ec =2224/41.\n\nWait, but we have variables e and f. Let me see. Let me denote variables e and f. Let me see if I can express e in terms of f or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can set e = (2224)/(41 c). Since ec =2224/41, so e = (2224)/(41 c). But c squared is 3024/41, so c = sqrt(3024/41). Hmm, this might get complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe we can set coordinates such that point D is in the z-axis? Wait, perhaps another coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to compute the volume via the scalar triple product once coordinates are set. Let me see.\n\nWe have coordinates for points A, B, C, D:\n\nA: (0,0,0)\n\nB: (sqrt(41),0,0)\n\nC: (16/sqrt(41), sqrt(3024/41), 0). Wait, but c is sqrt(3024/41). Wait, but actually c squared is 3024/41, so c is sqrt(3024/41). Let me compute sqrt(3024). Hmm, 3024 divided by 16 is 189, so sqrt(3024)=sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189). 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(189)=3*sqrt(21). Therefore sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt(21)=12 sqrt(21). Therefore sqrt(3024/41)= (12 sqrt(21))/sqrt(41). So c =12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). Similarly, sqrt(3024/41)=12 sqrt(21/41). Hmm, okay. So point C has coordinates ( (16 sqrt(41))/41 , (12 sqrt(21*41))/41 ??? Wait, let me recast coordinates properly.\n\nWait, perhaps better to keep variables as fractions. Let me note:\n\nCoordinates:\n\nA: (0,0,0)\n\nB: (sqrt(41),0,0)\n\nC: (16/sqrt(41), sqrt(3024/41), 0). Let me write sqrt(3024/41) as sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41). Since sqrt(3024)=sqrt(144*21)=12 sqrt(21). So sqrt(3024)/sqrt(41)=12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). Therefore, C is (16/sqrt(41), 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41), 0).\n\nPoint D: (25/sqrt(41), e, f). With e and f such that e\u00b2 + f\u00b2 =3024/41, and e*c =2224/41. Wait, c is 12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41). So:\n\ne*(12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) =2224/41 \u21d2 e= (2224/41) / (12 sqrt(21)/sqrt(41)) ) = (2224 /41 ) * (sqrt(41)/ (12 sqrt(21)) ) = (2224 sqrt(41) ) / (41 *12 sqrt(21)) )\n\nSimplify numerator and denominator:\n\n2224 divided by 41: 41*54=2214, so 2224-2214=10. So 2224=41*54 +10. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, 2224 divided by 4 is 556, so 2224=4*556, and 41 is prime. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute 2224 divided by 41. 41*54 = 2214. 2224 -2214=10. So 2224=41*54 +10. So e= ( (41*54 +10) sqrt(41) ) / (41*12 sqrt(21)) )\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps since the problem is symmetric, the coordinates can be arranged so that the tetrahedron is symmetric in some way, so that the inradius can be calculated more easily.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can compute the volume using another method. Since all opposite edges are equal, maybe the volume can be found by another formula.\n\nWait, in a disphenoid (a tetrahedron where opposite edges are equal), the volume is given by (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - d\u00b2) )) / (something). Wait, actually, let me recall that formula.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for the volume of a disphenoid is Volume = (sqrt( (ab)^2 - (cd)^2 )) / something? Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, here's a method from the internet (but since I can't access it, I need to recall).\n\nAlternatively, the volume of a disphenoid can be calculated using the formula:\n\nV = (4/3) * sqrt( (k1^2 + k2^2 + k3^2)/2 - (l1^2 + l2^2 + l3^2)/4 ) )\n\nWait, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for a tetrahedron with edges in pairs.\n\nAlternatively, let me think of the tetrahedron as two congruent triangles folded together. Since opposite edges are equal, the tetrahedron is \"isohedral\", so all its faces are congruent? Wait, not necessarily. Let me check.\n\nWait, actually in a disphenoid, all four faces are congruent triangles. Is that the case here? Let me check the edge lengths.\n\nThe faces are:\n\nFace ABC: edges AB=\u221a41, AC=\u221a80, BC=\u221a89.\n\nFace ABD: edges AB=\u221a41, AD=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80.\n\nFace ACD: edges AC=\u221a80, AD=\u221a89, CD=\u221a41.\n\nFace BCD: edges BC=\u221a89, BD=\u221a80, CD=\u221a41.\n\nSo yes, all four faces have the same three edge lengths: \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. So they are congruent triangles. Therefore, the tetrahedron is a disphenoid with congruent faces, so it's a kind of regular tetrahedron but not regular, but with congruent faces.\n\nTherefore, in such a tetrahedron, the volume can be calculated using the formula for a disphenoid:\n\nVolume V = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(b\u00b2 + c\u00b2 - d\u00b2) )) / (something). Wait, perhaps I need to look for another formula.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent triangles, the area of each face is the same. Let me compute the area of one face first, then multiply by 4 to get the surface area.\n\nCompute the area of triangle ABC with sides \u221a41, \u221a80, \u221a89. Let's use Heron's formula.\n\nFirst, compute the semi-perimeter: s = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2. Hmm, that might be messy, but maybe manageable.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for area in terms of sides:\n\nArea = (1/4) * sqrt( (a + b + c)(-a + b + c)(a - b + c)(a + b - c) )\n\nSo let me compute for triangle ABC with sides a=\u221a41, b=\u221a80, c=\u221a89.\n\nLet me compute each term:\n\n(a + b + c) = \u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89,\n\n(-a + b + c) = -\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89,\n\n(a - b + c) = \u221a41 - \u221a80 + \u221a89,\n\n(a + b - c) = \u221a41 + \u221a80 - \u221a89.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe compute numerically? Let me compute each term numerically.\n\nFirst, approximate the square roots:\n\n\u221a41 \u22486.4031,\n\n\u221a80\u22488.9443,\n\n\u221a89\u22489.4336.\n\nSo:\n\ns = (\u221a41 + \u221a80 + \u221a89)/2 \u2248 (6.4031 +8.9443 +9.4336)/2 \u2248 (24.781)/2 \u224812.3905.\n\nThen area = sqrt( s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c) )\n\nCompute s - a \u224812.3905 -6.4031\u22485.9874,\n\ns - b \u224812.3905 -8.9443\u22483.4462,\n\ns - c\u224812.3905 -9.4336\u22482.9569.\n\nThen the product inside sqrt is:\n\n12.3905 *5.9874 *3.4462 *2.9569 \u2248 Hmm, this is going to be tedious. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for area in terms of vectors. Wait, maybe using coordinates would be better here, even though it's tedious.\n\nAlternatively, since all four faces are congruent, the surface area A_total = 4*A_face.\n\nBut perhaps the key is to compute the volume. Let's think again of coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps use the Cayley-Menger determinant for the volume. That might be a systematic way.\n\nThe Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:\n\nV = (1/12) * sqrt( | CM | ), where CM is the determinant of the Cayley-Menger matrix:\n\n[ 0   1        1        1        1     ]\n\n[ 1   0      AB\u00b2     AC\u00b2     AD\u00b2   ]\n\n[ 1  AB\u00b2     0      BC\u00b2     BD\u00b2   ]\n\n[ 1  AC\u00b2    BC\u00b2      0      CD\u00b2   ]\n\n[ 1  AD\u00b2    BD\u00b2     CD\u00b2      0     ]\n\nSo let's write that out with the given edge lengths.\n\nGiven:\n\nAB = CD = sqrt(41) \u21d2 AB\u00b2=41, CD\u00b2=41,\n\nAC = BD = sqrt(80) \u21d2 AC\u00b2=80, BD\u00b2=80,\n\nAD = BC = sqrt(89) \u21d2 AD\u00b2=89, BC\u00b2=89.\n\nSo the Cayley-Menger matrix is:\n\nRow 0: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nRow 1: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nRow 2: [1,41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nRow 3: [1,80,89, 0,41]\n\nRow 4: [1,89,80,41,0]\n\nWe need to compute the determinant of this 5x5 matrix, then take the square root divided by 288 (since 12\u00b2=144, and 1/12 * sqrt(det) = V \u21d2 det = (12 V)^2 \u21d2 sqrt(det) =12 V \u21d2 V= sqrt(det)/12. Wait, actually the formula is V\u00b2 = (det)/(288\u00b2). Wait, let me check:\n\nThe formula is V^2 = (1/288)*CM determinant. So V = sqrt( CM determinant ) / (12 * sqrt(2))? Wait, perhaps better to recall the exact formula.\n\nWait, according to the Cayley-Menger determinant formula, the volume V of a tetrahedron is given by:\n\nV = \\frac{\\sqrt{ \\begin{vmatrix}\n0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\\n1 & 0 & AB^2 & AC^2 & AD^2 \\\\\n1 & AB^2 & 0 & BC^2 & BD^2 \\\\\n1 & AC^2 & BC^2 & 0 & CD^2 \\\\\n1 & AD^2 & BD^2 & CD^2 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{vmatrix}}}{288}\n\nWait, so the determinant is divided by 288 and then square-rooted, so V = sqrt( determinant ) / (288)^{1/2} * something? Wait no, actually the formula is:\n\nV^2 = determinant / 288\u00b2, so V = sqrt(determinant)/288 ?\n\nWait, actually, let me check the exact formula. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron is a 5x5 determinant, and the volume is given by:\n\nV = \\sqrt{ \\frac{ \\text{det} }{288} }\n\nSo V = sqrt( determinant ) / sqrt(288). Since sqrt(288)=12*sqrt(2), so V= sqrt(determinant)/(12 sqrt(2)). Wait, perhaps better to just compute the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, let me compute the determinant step by step. This might take time but is systematic.\n\nLet me denote the Cayley-Menger matrix as M:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1,41, 0,89,80\n\nRow 3:1,80,89,0,41\n\nRow 4:1,89,80,41,0\n\nWe need to compute determinant of this 5x5 matrix. Computing a 5x5 determinant is tedious, but perhaps there is symmetry we can exploit.\n\nLooking at the matrix, the matrix is symmetric except for the first row and column. Let me see if we can use some properties or row operations to simplify the determinant.\n\nAlternatively, let me denote the matrix as follows:\n\nLet me write the matrix entries as M[i][j] for rows 0-4 and columns 0-4.\n\nNote that the first row is [0,1,1,1,1], and the first column is [0,1,1,1,1]^T.\n\nLet me subtract row 1 from rows 2, 3, 4. Wait, but determinant calculations can be done with row operations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps expand along the first row.\n\nThe determinant of M is:\n\n0 * minor(0,0) - 1 * minor(0,1) + 1 * minor(0,2) -1 * minor(0,3) +1 * minor(0,4)\n\nBut since the first element is 0, that term drops out. So:\n\ndet(M) = -1 * minor(0,1) +1 * minor(0,2) -1 * minor(0,3) +1 * minor(0,4)\n\nWhere minor(0,j) is the determinant of the 4x4 matrix obtained by removing row 0 and column j.\n\nCompute each minor:\n\nFirst, minor(0,1): remove column 1. So the matrix becomes:\n\nRow0 (original row1): [1,41,80,89]\n\nRow1 (original row2): [1,0,89,80]\n\nRow2 (original row3): [1,89,0,41]\n\nRow3 (original row4): [1,80,41,0]\n\nWait, actually, removing column 1 (the second column, since columns are 0-4), so columns 0,2,3,4.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nOriginal columns after removing column 1 (which is the second column):\n\nColumns 0,2,3,4.\n\nSo for minor(0,1):\n\nThe rows are rows 1-4 (since we removed row0), and columns 0,2,3,4.\n\nSo entries:\n\nRow1 (original row1): columns 0,2,3,4: [1, 41,80,89]\n\nRow2 (original row2): [1, 0,89,80]\n\nRow3 (original row3): [1,89,0,41]\n\nRow4 (original row4): [1,80,41,0]\n\nSimilarly, minor(0,2): remove column2. So columns 0,1,3,4.\n\nSo:\n\nRow1: [1,0,80,89]\n\nRow2: [1,41,89,80]\n\nRow3: [1,80,0,41]\n\nRow4: [1,89,41,0]\n\nSimilarly for others, but this is getting very involved. Maybe there is symmetry here.\n\nAlternatively, note that the matrix after removing first row and column j may have some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps compute the determinant numerically. Since all the entries are integers except the first row and column, but actually, in the given edge lengths, all the squared edges are integers. Wait, AB\u00b2 etc. are integers. So the entire Cayley-Menger matrix has integer entries except the first row and column which have 0,1, etc. So the determinant is an integer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can look for a pattern or exploit the symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the tetrahedron can be embedded in a cube. Since in a disphenoid with opposite edges equal, sometimes they can be placed in a cube with vertices at opposite corners.\n\nWait, here's an idea: If we can place the tetrahedron so that its vertices are alternated vertices of a cube. For example, in a cube with edge length k, the space diagonal is k\u221a3, face diagonals are k\u221a2. Suppose the edges of the tetrahedron correspond to face diagonals and edges of the cube.\n\nWait, let me think. Suppose the cube has edge length L. Then, the face diagonals are L\u221a2, and the space diagonals are L\u221a3. Suppose the tetrahedron has edges of lengths sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). These need to correspond to combinations of the cube's edges.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the edges of the tetrahedron are combinations of the cube's edges. Let me see:\n\nSuppose the tetrahedron edges correspond to:\n\nAB = sqrt( (a)^2 + (b)^2 ), \n\nAC = sqrt( (a)^2 + (c)^2 ),\n\nAD = sqrt( (b)^2 + (c)^2 ),\n\nand similarly for the opposite edges. Wait, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, let me suppose that the tetrahedron is formed by four body diagonals of a cuboid. Wait, a cuboid with edge lengths p, q, r. Then the face diagonals are sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2), sqrt(p\u00b2 + r\u00b2), sqrt(q\u00b2 + r\u00b2), and the space diagonal sqrt(p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 + r\u00b2). But in our case, the edges of the tetrahedron are sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). Let me see:\n\nSuppose the edges of the tetrahedron correspond to the three face diagonals of a cuboid. Let me suppose that:\n\nAB = sqrt( p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 ) = sqrt(41),\n\nAC = sqrt( p\u00b2 + r\u00b2 ) = sqrt(80),\n\nAD = sqrt( q\u00b2 + r\u00b2 ) = sqrt(89).\n\nThen, solving for p, q, r:\n\nLet me set:\n\np\u00b2 + q\u00b2 =41,\n\np\u00b2 + r\u00b2=80,\n\nq\u00b2 + r\u00b2=89.\n\nLet me subtract first equation from the second: r\u00b2 - q\u00b2 =80 -41=39,\n\nThird equation: q\u00b2 + r\u00b2=89.\n\nLet me write equations:\n\nLet me denote x = q\u00b2, y = r\u00b2.\n\nThen:\n\ny -x =39,\n\nx + y =89.\n\nAdding both equations: 2y =128 \u21d2 y=64 \u21d2 x=89-64=25.\n\nThus, q\u00b2=25 \u21d2 q=5,\n\nr\u00b2=64 \u21d2r=8,\n\nThen from first equation, p\u00b2 +25=41 \u21d2 p\u00b2=16 \u21d2 p=4.\n\nTherefore, the cuboid has edges 4,5,8.\n\nSo the cuboid with edges 4,5,8. Then, the tetrahedron can be formed by the four body diagonals? Wait, no, the edges of the tetrahedron would be the face diagonals of the cuboid, which are sqrt(4\u00b2+5\u00b2)=sqrt(41), sqrt(4\u00b2+8\u00b2)=sqrt(80), sqrt(5\u00b2+8\u00b2)=sqrt(89). So yes! The tetrahedron is formed by the three face diagonals of a cuboid with edges 4,5,8. Therefore, the tetrahedron can be embedded in such a cuboid, with vertices at opposite corners of each face. \n\nTherefore, the volume of the tetrahedron can be calculated as 1/3 of the volume of the cuboid? Wait, no. Wait, actually, in such a case, the tetrahedron is formed by four non-adjacent vertices of the cuboid. Wait, actually, in a cuboid, selecting two opposite vertices along three edges would form a tetrahedron. Wait, perhaps the volume is 1/3 * base area * height, but maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, since the cuboid has volume 4*5*8=160. The tetrahedron is a part of this cuboid. In a cuboid, the tetrahedron formed by four alternate vertices (i.e., choosing one vertex and then the three opposite vertices on each face) has a volume equal to 1/3 of the cuboid's volume. Wait, let me think.\n\nActually, the cuboid can be divided into 6 tetrahedrons each congruent to this one? Not sure. Wait, in a cube, the space diagonal divides it into two tetrahedrons each with volume 1/3 of the cube. Maybe in a cuboid, similarly, the volume of the tetrahedron formed by four vertices (each pair connected by an edge of the tetrahedron being a face diagonal) is 1/3 of the cuboid's volume?\n\nWait, let me check with coordinates. Let me place the cuboid with edges 4,5,8 along the axes. Let me set vertex A at (0,0,0). Then the opposite vertices for the face diagonals would be:\n\nAB: suppose AB is the face diagonal on the 4x5 face. So point B would be (4,5,0).\n\nAC is the face diagonal on the 4x8 face: point C at (4,0,8).\n\nAD is the face diagonal on the 5x8 face: point D at (0,5,8).\n\nWait, then edges:\n\nAB: distance from (0,0,0) to (4,5,0) is sqrt(16+25)=sqrt(41). Good.\n\nAC: to (4,0,8): sqrt(16 +0 +64)=sqrt(80). Good.\n\nAD: to (0,5,8): sqrt(0+25+64)=sqrt(89). Good.\n\nThen, what is BC? Between (4,5,0) and (4,0,8):\n\ndx=0, dy=-5, dz=8. So sqrt(0 +25 +64)=sqrt(89). Which matches BC= sqrt(89).\n\nBD: between (4,5,0) and (0,5,8):\n\ndx=-4, dy=0, dz=8. sqrt(16+0+64)=sqrt(80). Good.\n\nCD: between (4,0,8) and (0,5,8):\n\ndx=-4, dy=5, dz=0. sqrt(16+25)=sqrt(41). Perfect. So yes, this works.\n\nTherefore, the tetrahedron is indeed embedded in a 4x5x8 cuboid, with vertices at (0,0,0), (4,5,0), (4,0,8), (0,5,8). The volume of this tetrahedron can be calculated using the scalar triple product.\n\nLet me compute vectors AB, AC, AD:\n\nVector AB = (4,5,0),\n\nVector AC = (4,0,8),\n\nVector AD = (0,5,8).\n\nThe volume is (1/6)* | scalar triple product of AB, AC, AD |.\n\nCompute the scalar triple product AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst compute AC \u00d7 AD:\n\nAC = (4,0,8),\n\nAD = (0,5,8).\n\nCross product:\n\ni  j  k\n\n4  0  8\n\n0  5  8\n\n= i*(0*8 -8*5) - j*(4*8 -8*0) +k*(4*5 -0*0)\n\n= i*(0 -40) - j*(32 -0) +k*(20 -0)\n\n= (-40, -32, 20)\n\nThen AB \u22c5 (AC \u00d7 AD) = (4,5,0) \u22c5 (-40, -32, 20) = 4*(-40) +5*(-32) +0*20 = -160 -160 +0 = -320.\n\nAbsolute value is 320. Volume is (1/6)*320 = 160/3 \u224853.333...\n\nWait, but the cuboid's volume is 4*5*8=160. So the tetrahedron's volume is 160/3, which is 1/3 of the cuboid's volume. That makes sense, similar to the cube case.\n\nTherefore, Volume V = 160/3.\n\nOkay, so that's a relief! So Volume is 160/3.\n\nNow, the surface area. Since all four faces are congruent triangles with sides sqrt(41), sqrt(80), sqrt(89). So compute the area of one face and multiply by 4.\n\nLet me compute the area using Heron's formula for triangle with sides a=sqrt(41), b=sqrt(80), c=sqrt(89).\n\nFirst compute semi-perimeter s=(sqrt(41)+sqrt(80)+sqrt(89))/2.\n\nBut Heron's formula might be messy here. Alternatively, since we have coordinates for the cuboid, let me compute the area of one face using coordinates.\n\nTake face ABC with points A(0,0,0), B(4,5,0), C(4,0,8).\n\nVectors AB=(4,5,0), AC=(4,0,8).\n\nThe area is (1/2)*|AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nCompute cross product AB \u00d7 AC:\n\nAB=(4,5,0),\n\nAC=(4,0,8).\n\nCross product:\n\ni  j  k\n\n4  5  0\n\n4  0  8\n\n= i*(5*8 -0*0) - j*(4*8 -0*4) +k*(4*0 -5*4)\n\n= i*(40) - j*(32) +k*(-20)\n\nSo cross product vector is (40, -32, -20).\n\nThe magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 +400 = 3024.\n\nTherefore, magnitude is sqrt(3024)=sqrt(144*21)=12*sqrt(21). Therefore, area is (1/2)*12*sqrt(21)=6 sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, each face has area 6 sqrt(21). Since there are four faces, total surface area A=4*6 sqrt(21)=24 sqrt(21).\n\nTherefore, the inradius r = 3V / A = 3*(160/3) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (160) / (24 sqrt(21)) ) = (20)/ (3 sqrt(21)).\n\nSimplify this expression:\n\nr = 20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/(3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63. Wait, but rationalizing the denominator:\n\n20/(3\u221a21) = (20\u221a21)/(3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63. Since 20 and 63 have a common factor of 1 (since 20 is 2\u00b2\u00d75, 63 is 3\u00b2\u00d77). So 20 and 63 are coprime? 20 and 63 share no common prime factors. Yes, GCD(20,63)=1. So the simplified form is (20\u221a21)/63. Therefore m=20, n=21, p=63. So m +n +p=20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but let me confirm the calculations again to be sure.\n\nFirst, Volume is 160/3.\n\nSurface area: Each face area is 6\u221a21, four faces gives 24\u221a21.\n\nThen inradius r = 3V/A = 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160/(24\u221a21) = simplifies numerator and denominator by 8: 20/(3\u221a21). Then rationalizing the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \u221a21: (20\u221a21)/(3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63. Yes, so m=20, n=21, p=63. 20 and 63 are coprime (since 20 factors 2,5; 63 factors 3,7). 21 is square-free. So the answer is 20 +21 +63=104.\n\nWait, but hold on. Let me check the cross product calculation again for the area.\n\nFor face ABC, vectors AB=(4,5,0), AC=(4,0,8). The cross product is (40, -32, -20). The magnitude squared is 40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 = 1600 + 1024 +400 = 1600+1024=2624+400=3024. sqrt(3024)=sqrt(144\u00d721)=12\u221a21. So area is half that: 6\u221a21. That's correct.\n\nSurface area total 24\u221a21. Volume 160/3. So 3V/A = (3*(160/3))/(24\u221a21)= 160/(24\u221a21)=20/(3\u221a21)=20\u221a21/63. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, m+n+p=20+21+63=104.\n\nBut let me just check if I made any miscalculations in the cuboid approach. Let me confirm the volume via coordinates.\n\nYes, using the scalar triple product, the volume was 160/3. The coordinates were set as A(0,0,0), B(4,5,0), C(4,0,8), D(0,5,8). The vectors AB, AC, AD are correct, and the cross and dot products led to 160/3. So that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of the cuboid volume 4\u00d75\u00d78=160, and the tetrahedron is 1/3 of that, so that also gives 160/3. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the inradius is indeed 20\u221a21/63. Thus the answer is 20+21+63=104. So the final answer is 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n\n\nGiven a tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) with edges \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\), we need to find the distance from the incenter to each face, expressed in the form \\(\\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p}\\) and compute \\(m + n + p\\).\n\nFirst, we recognize that the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, where opposite edges are equal. This tetrahedron can be embedded in a cuboid with edge lengths 4, 5, and 8. The vertices of the tetrahedron are at opposite corners of the cuboid's faces, leading to the coordinates:\n- \\(A = (0, 0, 0)\\)\n- \\(B = (4, 5, 0)\\)\n- \\(C = (4, 0, 8)\\)\n- \\(D = (0, 5, 8)\\)\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) of the tetrahedron is calculated using the scalar triple product of vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\), \\(\\overrightarrow{AC}\\), and \\(\\overrightarrow{AD}\\):\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = (4, 5, 0)\\)\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} = (4, 0, 8)\\)\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, 5, 8)\\)\n\nThe cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}\\) is:\n\\[\n\\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n4 & 0 & 8 \\\\\n0 & 5 & 8\n\\end{vmatrix} = (-40, -32, 20)\n\\]\n\nThe dot product \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD})\\) is:\n\\[\n(4, 5, 0) \\cdot (-40, -32, 20) = -160 - 160 + 0 = -320\n\\]\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) is:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{6} \\left| -320 \\right| = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we calculate the surface area. Each face of the tetrahedron is a triangle with sides \\(\\sqrt{41}\\), \\(\\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(\\sqrt{89}\\). The area of one face using vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{AC}\\) is:\n- Cross product magnitude: \\(\\sqrt{40^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2} = \\sqrt{3024} = 12\\sqrt{21}\\)\n- Area: \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times 12\\sqrt{21} = 6\\sqrt{21}\\)\n\nTotal surface area \\(A\\) is:\n\\[\n4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\nThe inradius \\(r\\) is given by \\(r = \\frac{3V}{A}\\):\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20}{3\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(m = 20\\), \\(n = 21\\), and \\(p = 63\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{104}\n\\]",

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this tetrahedron ABCD with edges given as AB=CD=\u221a41, AC=BD=\u221a80, and BC=AD=\u221a89. I need to find the distance from the incenter (I think that's the point equidistant to all faces) to each face, and express it in the form m\u221an/p where m and p are coprime and n square-free. Then find m + n + p.\n\nFirst, I remember that in a tetrahedron, the inradius (distance from incenter to each face) can be calculated by the formula 3 times volume divided by the total surface area. So maybe I should compute the volume and the surface area?\n\nBut before that, maybe I should figure out the coordinates of the vertices? Since the edges have specific lengths, perhaps setting up coordinates would help. Let me try that.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to the tetrahedron. Since the edges are given in pairs, maybe there's some symmetry here. Let me think: the edges AB and CD are both \u221a41, AC and BD are \u221a80, and BC and AD are \u221a89. Hmm, this seems like a \"bisosceles\" tetrahedron, where opposite edges are equal. I recall that in such a tetrahedron, the opposite edges are equal, and maybe it can be embedded in a coordinate system with coordinates such that the midpoints are at the origin or something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe place the points in 3D space such that calculations are manageable. Let me try setting point A at (0,0,0). Then, let me try to assign coordinates to B, C, D such that the distances match.\n\nWait, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps there is a way to assign coordinates so that the coordinates of A, B, C, D are symmetric in some way. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using vectors. Let me consider vectors for the points such that the centroid is at the origin? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe use coordinates such that the coordinates of A, B, C, D are (a, b, c), etc., but that might get too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the volume using the formula for a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. Since all the edges are given, perhaps using the formula involving the Cayley-Menger determinant?\n\nYes, that might be the way. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:\n\nVolume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n\n1 0 AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2\n\n1 AB\u00b2 0 BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2\n\n1 AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2 0 CD\u00b2\n\n1 AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2 0\n\nSo, if I can compute that determinant, then take the square root, multiply by 1/288, then take square root again to get the volume. Then, the surface area would be the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. Then, inradius is 3 Volume / Surface Area.\n\nAlright, let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's note the edge lengths:\n\nAB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = \u221a80, so AC\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = \u221a89, so AD\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = \u221a89, so BC\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = \u221a80, so BD\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = \u221a41, so CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, plugging into the Cayley-Menger determinant:\n\nThe matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, hold on, I need to make sure I'm setting up the matrix correctly. Let me recall the Cayley-Menger matrix structure. For points A,B,C,D, the matrix is a 5x5 matrix where the first row and column are [0,1,1,1,1], then the next rows and columns are the squared distances between the points. Wait, actually, the Cayley-Menger matrix for four points in 3D space is:\n\n| 0   1        1        1        1     |\n\n| 1   0     AB\u00b2    AC\u00b2    AD\u00b2    |\n\n| 1  AB\u00b2    0     BC\u00b2    BD\u00b2    |\n\n| 1  AC\u00b2   BC\u00b2     0     CD\u00b2    |\n\n| 1  AD\u00b2   BD\u00b2    CD\u00b2     0     |\n\nSo yes, that's the structure. So the determinant is as above.\n\nSo let's write this matrix out numerically.\n\nFirst row: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nSecond row: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nThird row: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nFourth row: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]\n\nFifth row: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n\nHmm, this determinant looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's some symmetry here. Let me see if I can compute this determinant step by step. Since this might take some time, perhaps expanding the determinant would be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me check if the tetrahedron is isohedral or something, but given the edge lengths, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the volume can be found through another method?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, there's a formula for the volume?\n\nWait, yes! If in a tetrahedron, the three pairs of opposite edges are equal (AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC), then it's called a \"disphenoid\", and its volume can be calculated by the formula:\n\nVolume = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - a\u00b2)(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - b\u00b2) )) / (12*sqrt(2)) )\n\nWait, I might need to check the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe the formula is Volume = sqrt( ( (AB\u00b2 + CD\u00b2 - AC\u00b2 - BD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 + BC\u00b2)^2 - ... )) Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to look up the formula for a disphenoid.\n\nAlternatively, let me see, since it's a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated as sqrt( (4*(AB\u00b2 * CD\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 * BD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 * BC\u00b2) - (AB^4 + AC^4 + AD^4 + BC^4 + BD^4 + CD^4)) ) / (12*sqrt(2)) )? Not sure, perhaps I need to think again.\n\nAlternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, then coordinates can be set such that the vertices are (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c) or something like that, leading to symmetric coordinates. Maybe this can help.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let me suppose coordinates for the tetrahedron such that:\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n\nLet A = (x, y, z)\n\nB = (-x, -y, z)\n\nC = (-x, y, -z)\n\nD = (x, -y, -z)\n\nThis way, the edges opposite each other would have the same length. Let me check:\n\nCompute AB distance:\n\nDistance between A and B: sqrt[ ( -x - x )\u00b2 + ( -y - y )\u00b2 + ( z - z )\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ ( -2x )\u00b2 + ( -2y )\u00b2 + 0 ] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, CD is the distance between C and D: sqrt[ (x - (-x))\u00b2 + ( -y - y )\u00b2 + ( -z - (-z) )\u00b2 ] = same as AB, sqrt(4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, AC is distance between A and C: sqrt[ (-x -x)^2 + (y - y)^2 + (-z - z)^2 ] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 )\n\nBD is distance between B and D: sqrt[ (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (-y - (-y))\u00b2 + (-z - z)^2 ] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, AD is distance between A and D: sqrt[ (x -x)^2 + (-y - y)^2 + (-z - z)^2 ] = sqrt(4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 )\n\nBC is distance between B and C: sqrt[ (-x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2 + (-z - z)^2 ] = sqrt(4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 )\n\nSo indeed, in this coordinate system, AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. Perfect! So this coordinate system can be used here. So let me assign coordinates this way.\n\nGiven that, we can set variables:\n\nLet AB\u00b2 = 4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 = 41,\n\nAC\u00b2 =4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 =80,\n\nAD\u00b2 =4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 =89,\n\nSo we have three equations:\n\n1) 4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 =41 --> x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =41/4,\n\n2)4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 =80 --> x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =20,\n\n3)4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 =89 --> y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =89/4,\n\nSo we can solve for x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =41/4,\n\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =20,\n\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =89/4.\n\nLet me subtract equation1 from equation2: (x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =20 -41/4,\n\nThus, z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (80/4 -41/4)=39/4,\n\nSimilarly, equation3 is y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =89/4,\n\nSo we have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4,\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =89/4,\n\nAdding these two equations: 2 z\u00b2 = (39 +89)/4 =128/4=32,\n\nThus z\u00b2 =16,\n\nThen z =4 or -4, but since we can take coordinates positive, let's say z=4.\n\nThen, from z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 =39/4,\n\n16 - y\u00b2 =39/4,\n\nSo y\u00b2 =16 -39/4 = (64 -39)/4 =25/4,\n\nThus y=5/2 or -5/2,\n\nSimilarly, from equation1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =41/4,\n\nSo x\u00b2 =41/4 - y\u00b2 =41/4 -25/4=16/4=4,\n\nThus x\u00b2=4, so x=2 or -2.\n\nTherefore, coordinates can be set as:\n\nLet me pick A=(2, 5/2, 4),\n\nThen B=(-2, -5/2,4),\n\nC=(-2,5/2, -4),\n\nD=(2, -5/2, -4).\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nCompute AB distance between A(2,5/2,4) and B(-2, -5/2,4):\n\nsqrt[ (-2-2)^2 + (-5/2 -5/2)^2 + (4-4)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-4)^2 + (-5)^2 +0] = sqrt(16 +25)=sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nAC distance between A(2,5/2,4) and C(-2,5/2,-4):\n\nsqrt[ (-2-2)^2 + (5/2 -5/2)^2 + (-4 -4)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-4)^2 +0 + (-8)^2 ]= sqrt(16 +64)=sqrt(80). Correct.\n\nAD between A(2,5/2,4) and D(2, -5/2, -4):\n\nsqrt[ (2-2)^2 + (-5/2 -5/2)^2 + (-4 -4)^2 ] = sqrt[0 + (-5)^2 + (-8)^2 ]= sqrt(25 +64)=sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, BC distance between B(-2,-5/2,4) and C(-2,5/2,-4):\n\nsqrt[ (-2+2)^2 + (5/2 +5/2)^2 + (-4-4)^2 ]= sqrt[0 + (5)^2 + (-8)^2 ]= sqrt(25+64)=sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nBD between B(-2,-5/2,4) and D(2,-5/2,-4):\n\nsqrt[ (2+2)^2 + (-5/2 +5/2)^2 + (-4 -4)^2 ]= sqrt[4^2 +0 + (-8)^2 ]= sqrt(16+64)=sqrt(80). Correct.\n\nCD between C(-2,5/2,-4) and D(2,-5/2,-4):\n\nsqrt[ (2+2)^2 + (-5/2 -5/2)^2 + (-4 +4)^2 ]= sqrt[4^2 + (-5)^2 +0 ]= sqrt(16 +25)=sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nPerfect, so coordinates are set correctly.\n\nNow, with coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe volume can be found via the scalar triple product. Since we have coordinates for all four points, let's choose one as the origin. Let me take point A as the origin (2,5/2,4). Wait, but in coordinates, actually, in the standard coordinate system, the volume is 1/6 | scalar triple product of vectors AB, AC, AD |.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula: if you have four points A, B, C, D, then the volume is (1/6)* | (AB \u00d7 AC) \u2022 AD |.\n\nSo let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nFirst, let me note coordinates:\n\nA is (2, 5/2,4),\n\nB is (-2, -5/2,4),\n\nC is (-2,5/2, -4),\n\nD is (2, -5/2, -4).\n\nTherefore,\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, 4-4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 -2, 5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow compute the scalar triple product AB \u2022 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me compute the cross product of AC and AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product is determinant:\n\ni  j  k\n\n-4 0 -8\n\n0 -5 -8\n\nCalculates to:\n\ni*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) -0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 -0] = -32\n\nk: (-4)*(-5) -0*0 = 20 -0 =20\n\nSo AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nThen, take the dot product with AB = (-4, -5, 0):\n\nDot product = (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nTherefore, the scalar triple product is 320, so volume is (1/6)*|320| = 320/6 = 160/3 \u2248 53.333...\n\nWait, but let me confirm the cross product calculation again because that might be a source of error.\n\nWait, cross product:\n\nFirst component (i):\n\n(AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y) = (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nSecond component (j):\n\n-(AC_x * AD_z - AC_z * AD_x) = -[ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = -[32 -0] = -32\n\nThird component (k):\n\nAC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x = (-4)*(-5) -0*0 = 20 -0 =20\n\nYes, that's correct. Then the cross product is (-40, -32, 20). Then dot with AB (-4, -5,0):\n\n(-4)(-40) =160, (-5)(-32)=160, 0*20=0. Total 320. So volume is 320/6 = 160/3. So Volume is 160/3.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, the next step is to compute the total surface area of the tetrahedron. Since all four faces are triangles, each face's area can be computed using Heron's formula or via coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates, maybe compute the area of each face with vectors.\n\nLet me compute the area of each face:\n\nFirst, Face ABC:\n\nPoints A, B, C.\n\nVectors AB and AC are already computed earlier. The area is (1/2)*|AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nWait, AB is (-4, -5,0), AC is (-4,0,-8). Their cross product is:\n\nAB \u00d7 AC:\n\ni  j  k\n\n-4 -5 0\n\n-4 0 -8\n\nCalculates to:\n\ni*(-5*(-8) -0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) -0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n\n= i*(40 -0) - j*(32 -0) +k*(0 -20)\n\n= (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 +400)= sqrt(3024).\n\nWait sqrt(3024). Let me compute that:\n\n3024 divided by 16 is 189, so sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189). 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(9*21)=3*sqrt21, so total sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt21=12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore the cross product magnitude is 12\u221a21, so the area of ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21 =6\u221a21.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute area of ABD:\n\nFace ABD: points A,B,D.\n\nVectors AB and AD. AB is (-4, -5,0), AD is (0, -5, -8). Their cross product is AB \u00d7 AD.\n\nCompute cross product:\n\ni   j    k\n\n-4  -5   0\n\n0   -5  -8\n\n= i*(-5*(-8) -0*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) -0*0) +k*(-4*(-5) - (-5)*0)\n\n= i*(40 -0) - j*(32 -0) +k*(20 -0)\n\n= (40, -32, 20)\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 +20\u00b2)= same as before sqrt(1600+1024+400)= sqrt(3024)=12\u221a21. So area is (1/2)*12\u221a21=6\u221a21.\n\nWait, same as ABC? Interesting.\n\nNow, Face ACD:\n\nPoints A,C,D.\n\nVectors AC and AD. AC is (-4,0,-8), AD is (0, -5, -8). Their cross product:\n\nAC \u00d7 AD is already calculated earlier as (-40, -32,20), which had a magnitude of sqrt( (-40)^2 + (-32)^2 +20^2 ) = sqrt(1600 +1024 +400)= same sqrt(3024)=12\u221a21. So area is 6\u221a21 again.\n\nHmm, so three faces have area 6\u221a21 each?\n\nWait, let me check the last face, BCD.\n\nFace BCD: points B,C,D.\n\nVectors BC and BD.\n\nCompute vectors BC and BD. Let me compute vectors from point B to C and B to D.\n\nVector BC = C - B = (-2 - (-2),5/2 - (-5/2), -4 -4)= (0,5, -8)\n\nWait, coordinates:\n\nB is (-2, -5/2,4),\n\nC is (-2,5/2, -4),\n\nso BC is ( -2 - (-2),5/2 - (-5/2), -4 -4) = (0,5, -8).\n\nVector BD = D - B = (2 - (-2), -5/2 - (-5/2), -4 -4) = (4,0,-8)\n\nSo vectors BC=(0,5,-8), BD=(4,0,-8). Compute cross product BC \u00d7 BD.\n\nCompute:\n\ni   j   k\n\n0   5  -8\n\n4   0  -8\n\n= i*(5*(-8) - (-8)*0) - j*(0*(-8) - (-8)*4) +k*(0*0 -5*4)\n\n= i*(-40 -0) - j*(0 +32) +k*(0 -20)\n\n= (-40, -32, -20)\n\nMagnitude is sqrt( (-40)^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 ) = sqrt(1600 +1024 +400)= same sqrt(3024)=12\u221a21. So area is 6\u221a21.\n\nSo all four faces have the same area of 6\u221a21. That's interesting, so the tetrahedron is isohedral? Since all faces are congruent, perhaps.\n\nTherefore, total surface area is 4*(6\u221a21)=24\u221a21.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. Each face is 6\u221a21, four faces, so total surface area is 24\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the inradius is (3*Volume)/Surface Area = (3*(160/3))/24\u221a21 = (160)/24\u221a21 = (20)/3\u221a21.\n\nWait, hold on, let's check:\n\nWait, inradius formula is 3V / A, where A is total surface area.\n\nYes, so 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = simplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/(3\u221a21). So yes, 20/(3\u221a21). To rationalize the denominator:\n\n20/(3\u221a21) = 20\u221a21/(3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63. Since 20 and 63 are coprime (20 factors 2,5; 63 is 7,3, so no common factors), and 21 is 3*7, which is square-free. So the form is (20\u221a21)/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Thus m + n + p = 20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check again the calculations step by step because I might have made an error in volume or surface area.\n\nFirst, Volume was 160/3? Let me check again the scalar triple product:\n\nAB \u2022 (AC \u00d7 AD). Wait, the cross product AC \u00d7 AD was (-40, -32, 20). Then AB is (-4, -5, 0). The dot product is:\n\n(-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320. Then Volume is 320 /6 = 160/3. Correct.\n\nSurface area: each face area is 6\u221a21. So four faces: 24\u221a21. Correct.\n\nThus inradius is 3*(160/3) divided by 24\u221a21: indeed 160/(24\u221a21). Simplify:\n\n160 divided by 24 is 20/3, so 20/(3\u221a21). Rationalizing gives 20\u221a21/(3*21) = 20\u221a21/63. Since 20 and 63 have no common factors (prime factors of 20: 2,5; 63:3,7), so yes, reduced fraction. And 21 is square-free (3*7). Therefore, m=20, n=21, p=63, so sum is 20+21+63=104.\n\nHmm, but before I conclude, I need to make sure that the inradius formula applies here. The formula for inradius in a tetrahedron is indeed 3V/A, where A is the total surface area. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, in a tetrahedron, the inradius r is given by r = (3V)/A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area. Since the inradius is the same distance to each face, and the volume can also be expressed as (1/3)*A*r, so solving for r gives r= 3V/A. So that formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 104. Wait, but let me check the problem statement again to make sure.\n\nThe problem says: \"the distances from I to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal\". So that point is called the incenter, and the formula applies here. Since the tetrahedron is isohedral (all faces congruent), the inradius should be the same for all faces, so the calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent triangles, the inradius should indeed be the same. So I think this is correct. So the final answer is 20 + 21 + 63 = 104. So I think that's the answer. Let me just check once more the surface area and volume.\n\nWait, the cross product for the first face ABC was AB \u00d7 AC gave a magnitude of 12\u221a21, so area 6\u221a21. Since all faces are the same, total area 24\u221a21. Volume is 160/3. So 3*(160/3)=160 divided by 24\u221a21 gives 160/(24\u221a21) reduces to 20/(3\u221a21). Then rationalizing gives 20\u221a21 / 63. Yep. So m=20, n=21, p=63. 20+21+63=104.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 104. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n",

Since the edges are given in pairs, maybe there's some symmetry here. Let me think: the edges AB and CD are both \u221a41, AC and BD are \u221a80, and BC and AD are \u221a89. Hmm, this seems like a \"bisosceles\" tetrahedron, where opposite edges are equal. I recall that in such a tetrahedron, the opposite edges are equal, and maybe it can be embedded in a coordinate system with coordinates such that the midpoints are at the origin or something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe place the points in 3D space such that calculations are manageable. Let me try setting point A at (0,0,0). Then, let me try to assign coordinates to B, C, D such that the distances match.\n\nWait, since opposite edges are equal, perhaps there is a way to assign coordinates so that the coordinates of A, B, C, D are symmetric in some way. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe using vectors. Let me consider vectors for the points such that the centroid is at the origin? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe use coordinates such that the coordinates of A, B, C, D are (a, b, c), etc., but that might get too complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe compute the volume using the formula for a tetrahedron with given edge lengths. Since all the edges are given, perhaps using the formula involving the Cayley-Menger determinant?\n\nYes, that might be the way. The Cayley-Menger determinant for a tetrahedron with edge lengths AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD is given by:\n\nVolume^2 = (1/288) * determinant of the matrix:\n\n0 1 1 1 1\n\n1 0 AB\u00b2 AC\u00b2 AD\u00b2\n\n1 AB\u00b2 0 BC\u00b2 BD\u00b2\n\n1 AC\u00b2 BC\u00b2 0 CD\u00b2\n\n1 AD\u00b2 BD\u00b2 CD\u00b2 0\n\nSo, if I can compute that determinant, then take the square root, multiply by 1/288, then take square root again to get the volume. Then, the surface area would be the sum of the areas of the four triangular faces. Then, inradius is 3 Volume / Surface Area.\n\nAlright, let me try that.\n\nFirst, let's note the edge lengths:\n\nAB = \u221a41, so AB\u00b2 = 41\n\nAC = \u221a80, so AC\u00b2 = 80\n\nAD = \u221a89, so AD\u00b2 = 89\n\nBC = \u221a89, so BC\u00b2 = 89\n\nBD = \u221a80, so BD\u00b2 = 80\n\nCD = \u221a41, so CD\u00b2 = 41\n\nSo, plugging into the Cayley-Menger determinant:\n\nThe matrix is:\n\nRow 0: 0, 1, 1, 1, 1\n\nRow 1: 1, 0, 41, 80, 89\n\nRow 2: 1, 41, 0, 89, 80\n\nRow 3: 1, 80, 89, 0, 41\n\nRow 4: 1, 89, 80, 41, 0\n\nWait, hold on, I need to make sure I'm setting up the matrix correctly. Let me recall the Cayley-Menger matrix structure. For points A,B,C,D, the matrix is a 5x5 matrix where the first row and column are [0,1,1,1,1], then the next rows and columns are the squared distances between the points. Wait, actually, the Cayley-Menger matrix for four points in 3D space is:\n\n| 0   1        1        1        1     |\n\n| 1   0     AB\u00b2    AC\u00b2    AD\u00b2    |\n\n| 1  AB\u00b2    0     BC\u00b2    BD\u00b2    |\n\n| 1  AC\u00b2   BC\u00b2     0     CD\u00b2    |\n\n| 1  AD\u00b2   BD\u00b2    CD\u00b2     0     |\n\nSo yes, that's the structure. So the determinant is as above.\n\nSo let's write this matrix out numerically.\n\nFirst row: [0, 1, 1, 1, 1]\n\nSecond row: [1, 0, 41, 80, 89]\n\nThird row: [1, 41, 0, 89, 80]\n\nFourth row: [1, 80, 89, 0, 41]\n\nFifth row: [1, 89, 80, 41, 0]\n\nHmm, this determinant looks a bit complicated, but maybe there's some symmetry here. Let me see if I can compute this determinant step by step. Since this might take some time, perhaps expanding the determinant would be necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me check if the tetrahedron is isohedral or something, but given the edge lengths, perhaps not. Alternatively, maybe the volume can be found through another method?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the fact that in a tetrahedron with opposite edges equal, there's a formula for the volume?\n\nWait, yes! If in a tetrahedron, the three pairs of opposite edges are equal (AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC), then it's called a \"disphenoid\", and its volume can be calculated by the formula:\n\nVolume = (sqrt( (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - c\u00b2)(a\u00b2 + b\u00b2 - d\u00b2)(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - a\u00b2)(c\u00b2 + d\u00b2 - b\u00b2) )) / (12*sqrt(2)) )\n\nWait, I might need to check the exact formula. Alternatively, maybe the formula is Volume = sqrt( ( (AB\u00b2 + CD\u00b2 - AC\u00b2 - BD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 + BC\u00b2)^2 - ... )) Hmm, not sure. Maybe better to look up the formula for a disphenoid.\n\nAlternatively, let me see, since it's a disphenoid, the volume can be calculated as sqrt( (4*(AB\u00b2 * CD\u00b2 + AC\u00b2 * BD\u00b2 + AD\u00b2 * BC\u00b2) - (AB^4 + AC^4 + AD^4 + BC^4 + BD^4 + CD^4)) ) / (12*sqrt(2)) )? Not sure, perhaps I need to think again.\n\nAlternatively, since all opposite edges are equal, then coordinates can be set such that the vertices are (a, b, c), (-a, -b, c), (-a, b, -c), (a, -b, -c) or something like that, leading to symmetric coordinates. Maybe this can help.\n\nLet me try this approach. Let me suppose coordinates for the tetrahedron such that:\n\nLet me denote the coordinates as follows:\n\nLet A = (x, y, z)\n\nB = (-x, -y, z)\n\nC = (-x, y, -z)\n\nD = (x, -y, -z)\n\nThis way, the edges opposite each other would have the same length. Let me check:\n\nCompute AB distance:\n\nDistance between A and B: sqrt[ ( -x - x )\u00b2 + ( -y - y )\u00b2 + ( z - z )\u00b2 ] = sqrt[ ( -2x )\u00b2 + ( -2y )\u00b2 + 0 ] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, CD is the distance between C and D: sqrt[ (x - (-x))\u00b2 + ( -y - y )\u00b2 + ( -z - (-z) )\u00b2 ] = same as AB, sqrt(4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, AC is distance between A and C: sqrt[ (-x -x)^2 + (y - y)^2 + (-z - z)^2 ] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 + 4z\u00b2 )\n\nBD is distance between B and D: sqrt[ (x - (-x))\u00b2 + (-y - (-y))\u00b2 + (-z - z)^2 ] = sqrt(4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 )\n\nSimilarly, AD is distance between A and D: sqrt[ (x -x)^2 + (-y - y)^2 + (-z - z)^2 ] = sqrt(4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 )\n\nBC is distance between B and C: sqrt[ (-x - (-x))\u00b2 + (y - (-y))\u00b2 + (-z - z)^2 ] = sqrt(4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 )\n\nSo indeed, in this coordinate system, AB=CD, AC=BD, AD=BC. Perfect! So this coordinate system can be used here. So let me assign coordinates this way.\n\nGiven that, we can set variables:\n\nLet AB\u00b2 = 4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 = 41,\n\nAC\u00b2 =4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 =80,\n\nAD\u00b2 =4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 =89,\n\nSo we have three equations:\n\n1) 4x\u00b2 +4y\u00b2 =41 --> x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =41/4,\n\n2)4x\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 =80 --> x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =20,\n\n3)4y\u00b2 +4z\u00b2 =89 --> y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =89/4,\n\nSo we can solve for x\u00b2, y\u00b2, z\u00b2.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nEquation 1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =41/4,\n\nEquation 2: x\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =20,\n\nEquation 3: y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =89/4.\n\nLet me subtract equation1 from equation2: (x\u00b2 + z\u00b2) - (x\u00b2 + y\u00b2) =20 -41/4,\n\nThus, z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = (80/4 -41/4)=39/4,\n\nSimilarly, equation3 is y\u00b2 + z\u00b2 =89/4,\n\nSo we have:\n\nz\u00b2 - y\u00b2 = 39/4,\n\nz\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =89/4,\n\nAdding these two equations: 2 z\u00b2 = (39 +89)/4 =128/4=32,\n\nThus z\u00b2 =16,\n\nThen z =4 or -4, but since we can take coordinates positive, let's say z=4.\n\nThen, from z\u00b2 - y\u00b2 =39/4,\n\n16 - y\u00b2 =39/4,\n\nSo y\u00b2 =16 -39/4 = (64 -39)/4 =25/4,\n\nThus y=5/2 or -5/2,\n\nSimilarly, from equation1: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 =41/4,\n\nSo x\u00b2 =41/4 - y\u00b2 =41/4 -25/4=16/4=4,\n\nThus x\u00b2=4, so x=2 or -2.\n\nTherefore, coordinates can be set as:\n\nLet me pick A=(2, 5/2, 4),\n\nThen B=(-2, -5/2,4),\n\nC=(-2,5/2, -4),\n\nD=(2, -5/2, -4).\n\nWait, let me confirm:\n\nCompute AB distance between A(2,5/2,4) and B(-2, -5/2,4):\n\nsqrt[ (-2-2)^2 + (-5/2 -5/2)^2 + (4-4)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-4)^2 + (-5)^2 +0] = sqrt(16 +25)=sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nAC distance between A(2,5/2,4) and C(-2,5/2,-4):\n\nsqrt[ (-2-2)^2 + (5/2 -5/2)^2 + (-4 -4)^2 ] = sqrt[ (-4)^2 +0 + (-8)^2 ]= sqrt(16 +64)=sqrt(80). Correct.\n\nAD between A(2,5/2,4) and D(2, -5/2, -4):\n\nsqrt[ (2-2)^2 + (-5/2 -5/2)^2 + (-4 -4)^2 ] = sqrt[0 + (-5)^2 + (-8)^2 ]= sqrt(25 +64)=sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nSimilarly, BC distance between B(-2,-5/2,4) and C(-2,5/2,-4):\n\nsqrt[ (-2+2)^2 + (5/2 +5/2)^2 + (-4-4)^2 ]= sqrt[0 + (5)^2 + (-8)^2 ]= sqrt(25+64)=sqrt(89). Correct.\n\nBD between B(-2,-5/2,4) and D(2,-5/2,-4):\n\nsqrt[ (2+2)^2 + (-5/2 +5/2)^2 + (-4 -4)^2 ]= sqrt[4^2 +0 + (-8)^2 ]= sqrt(16+64)=sqrt(80). Correct.\n\nCD between C(-2,5/2,-4) and D(2,-5/2,-4):\n\nsqrt[ (2+2)^2 + (-5/2 -5/2)^2 + (-4 +4)^2 ]= sqrt[4^2 + (-5)^2 +0 ]= sqrt(16 +25)=sqrt(41). Correct.\n\nPerfect, so coordinates are set correctly.\n\nNow, with coordinates, I can compute the volume of the tetrahedron.\n\nThe volume can be found via the scalar triple product. Since we have coordinates for all four points, let's choose one as the origin. Let me take point A as the origin (2,5/2,4). Wait, but in coordinates, actually, in the standard coordinate system, the volume is 1/6 | scalar triple product of vectors AB, AC, AD |.\n\nWait, let me recall the formula: if you have four points A, B, C, D, then the volume is (1/6)* | (AB \u00d7 AC) \u2022 AD |.\n\nSo let me compute vectors AB, AC, AD.\n\nFirst, let me note coordinates:\n\nA is (2, 5/2,4),\n\nB is (-2, -5/2,4),\n\nC is (-2,5/2, -4),\n\nD is (2, -5/2, -4).\n\nTherefore,\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, 4-4) = (-4, -5, 0)\n\nVector AC = C - A = (-2 -2, 5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nVector AD = D - A = (2 -2, -5/2 -5/2, -4 -4) = (0, -5, -8)\n\nNow compute the scalar triple product AB \u2022 (AC \u00d7 AD).\n\nFirst, compute AC \u00d7 AD.\n\nLet me compute the cross product of AC and AD.\n\nAC = (-4, 0, -8)\n\nAD = (0, -5, -8)\n\nCross product is determinant:\n\ni  j  k\n\n-4 0 -8\n\n0 -5 -8\n\nCalculates to:\n\ni*(0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) - (-8)*0) + k*(-4*(-5) -0*0)\n\nCompute each component:\n\ni: 0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nj: - [ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = - [32 -0] = -32\n\nk: (-4)*(-5) -0*0 = 20 -0 =20\n\nSo AC \u00d7 AD = (-40, -32, 20)\n\nThen, take the dot product with AB = (-4, -5, 0):\n\nDot product = (-4)*(-40) + (-5)*(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320\n\nTherefore, the scalar triple product is 320, so volume is (1/6)*|320| = 320/6 = 160/3 \u2248 53.333...\n\nWait, but let me confirm the cross product calculation again because that might be a source of error.\n\nWait, cross product:\n\nFirst component (i):\n\n(AC_y * AD_z - AC_z * AD_y) = (0*(-8) - (-8)*(-5)) = 0 - 40 = -40\n\nSecond component (j):\n\n-(AC_x * AD_z - AC_z * AD_x) = -[ (-4)*(-8) - (-8)*0 ] = -[32 -0] = -32\n\nThird component (k):\n\nAC_x * AD_y - AC_y * AD_x = (-4)*(-5) -0*0 = 20 -0 =20\n\nYes, that's correct. Then the cross product is (-40, -32, 20). Then dot with AB (-4, -5,0):\n\n(-4)(-40) =160, (-5)(-32)=160, 0*20=0. Total 320. So volume is 320/6 = 160/3. So Volume is 160/3.\n\nHmm, okay. Now, the next step is to compute the total surface area of the tetrahedron. Since all four faces are triangles, each face's area can be computed using Heron's formula or via coordinates.\n\nAlternatively, since we have coordinates, maybe compute the area of each face with vectors.\n\nLet me compute the area of each face:\n\nFirst, Face ABC:\n\nPoints A, B, C.\n\nVectors AB and AC are already computed earlier. The area is (1/2)*|AB \u00d7 AC|.\n\nWait, AB is (-4, -5,0), AC is (-4,0,-8). Their cross product is:\n\nAB \u00d7 AC:\n\ni  j  k\n\n-4 -5 0\n\n-4 0 -8\n\nCalculates to:\n\ni*(-5*(-8) -0*0) - j*(-4*(-8) -0*(-4)) + k*(-4*0 - (-5)*(-4))\n\n= i*(40 -0) - j*(32 -0) +k*(0 -20)\n\n= (40, -32, -20)\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2) = sqrt(1600 + 1024 +400)= sqrt(3024).\n\nWait sqrt(3024). Let me compute that:\n\n3024 divided by 16 is 189, so sqrt(16*189)=4*sqrt(189). 189 is 9*21, so sqrt(9*21)=3*sqrt21, so total sqrt(3024)=4*3*sqrt21=12\u221a21.\n\nTherefore the cross product magnitude is 12\u221a21, so the area of ABC is (1/2)*12\u221a21 =6\u221a21.\n\nSimilarly, let's compute area of ABD:\n\nFace ABD: points A,B,D.\n\nVectors AB and AD. AB is (-4, -5,0), AD is (0, -5, -8). Their cross product is AB \u00d7 AD.\n\nCompute cross product:\n\ni   j    k\n\n-4  -5   0\n\n0   -5  -8\n\n= i*(-5*(-8) -0*(-5)) - j*(-4*(-8) -0*0) +k*(-4*(-5) - (-5)*0)\n\n= i*(40 -0) - j*(32 -0) +k*(20 -0)\n\n= (40, -32, 20)\n\nThe magnitude of this cross product is sqrt(40\u00b2 + (-32)^2 +20\u00b2)= same as before sqrt(1600+1024+400)= sqrt(3024)=12\u221a21. So area is (1/2)*12\u221a21=6\u221a21.\n\nWait, same as ABC? Interesting.\n\nNow, Face ACD:\n\nPoints A,C,D.\n\nVectors AC and AD. AC is (-4,0,-8), AD is (0, -5, -8). Their cross product:\n\nAC \u00d7 AD is already calculated earlier as (-40, -32,20), which had a magnitude of sqrt( (-40)^2 + (-32)^2 +20^2 ) = sqrt(1600 +1024 +400)= same sqrt(3024)=12\u221a21. So area is 6\u221a21 again.\n\nHmm, so three faces have area 6\u221a21 each?\n\nWait, let me check the last face, BCD.\n\nFace BCD: points B,C,D.\n\nVectors BC and BD.\n\nCompute vectors BC and BD. Let me compute vectors from point B to C and B to D.\n\nVector BC = C - B = (-2 - (-2),5/2 - (-5/2), -4 -4)= (0,5, -8)\n\nWait, coordinates:\n\nB is (-2, -5/2,4),\n\nC is (-2,5/2, -4),\n\nso BC is ( -2 - (-2),5/2 - (-5/2), -4 -4) = (0,5, -8).\n\nVector BD = D - B = (2 - (-2), -5/2 - (-5/2), -4 -4) = (4,0,-8)\n\nSo vectors BC=(0,5,-8), BD=(4,0,-8). Compute cross product BC \u00d7 BD.\n\nCompute:\n\ni   j   k\n\n0   5  -8\n\n4   0  -8\n\n= i*(5*(-8) - (-8)*0) - j*(0*(-8) - (-8)*4) +k*(0*0 -5*4)\n\n= i*(-40 -0) - j*(0 +32) +k*(0 -20)\n\n= (-40, -32, -20)\n\nMagnitude is sqrt( (-40)^2 + (-32)^2 + (-20)^2 ) = sqrt(1600 +1024 +400)= same sqrt(3024)=12\u221a21. So area is 6\u221a21.\n\nSo all four faces have the same area of 6\u221a21. That's interesting, so the tetrahedron is isohedral? Since all faces are congruent, perhaps.\n\nTherefore, total surface area is 4*(6\u221a21)=24\u221a21.\n\nWait, but let me confirm again. Each face is 6\u221a21, four faces, so total surface area is 24\u221a21.\n\nTherefore, the inradius is (3*Volume)/Surface Area = (3*(160/3))/24\u221a21 = (160)/24\u221a21 = (20)/3\u221a21.\n\nWait, hold on, let's check:\n\nWait, inradius formula is 3V / A, where A is total surface area.\n\nYes, so 3*(160/3) / (24\u221a21) = 160 / (24\u221a21) = simplify numerator and denominator:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 8: 20/(3\u221a21). So yes, 20/(3\u221a21). To rationalize the denominator:\n\n20/(3\u221a21) = 20\u221a21/(3*21) = (20\u221a21)/63. Since 20 and 63 are coprime (20 factors 2,5; 63 is 7,3, so no common factors), and 21 is 3*7, which is square-free. So the form is (20\u221a21)/63, so m=20, n=21, p=63. Thus m + n + p = 20+21+63=104.\n\nWait, but hold on, let me check again the calculations step by step because I might have made an error in volume or surface area.\n\nFirst, Volume was 160/3? Let me check again the scalar triple product:\n\nAB \u2022 (AC \u00d7 AD). Wait, the cross product AC \u00d7 AD was (-40, -32, 20). Then AB is (-4, -5, 0). The dot product is:\n\n(-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + 0*20 = 160 + 160 + 0 = 320. Then Volume is 320 /6 = 160/3. Correct.\n\nSurface area: each face area is 6\u221a21. So four faces: 24\u221a21. Correct.\n\nThus inradius is 3*(160/3) divided by 24\u221a21: indeed 160/(24\u221a21). Simplify:\n\n160 divided by 24 is 20/3, so 20/(3\u221a21). Rationalizing gives 20\u221a21/(3*21) = 20\u221a21/63. Since 20 and 63 have no common factors (prime factors of 20: 2,5; 63:3,7), so yes, reduced fraction. And 21 is square-free (3*7). Therefore, m=20, n=21, p=63, so sum is 20+21+63=104.\n\nHmm, but before I conclude, I need to make sure that the inradius formula applies here. The formula for inradius in a tetrahedron is indeed 3V/A, where A is the total surface area. Let me confirm that.\n\nYes, in a tetrahedron, the inradius r is given by r = (3V)/A, where V is the volume and A is the total surface area. Since the inradius is the same distance to each face, and the volume can also be expressed as (1/3)*A*r, so solving for r gives r= 3V/A. So that formula is correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 104. Wait, but let me check the problem statement again to make sure.\n\nThe problem says: \"the distances from I to each of the faces of the tetrahedron are all equal\". So that point is called the incenter, and the formula applies here. Since the tetrahedron is isohedral (all faces congruent), the inradius should be the same for all faces, so the calculation should hold.\n\nAlternatively, since all faces are congruent triangles, the inradius should indeed be the same. So I think this is correct. So the final answer is 20 + 21 + 63 = 104. So I think that's the answer. Let me just check once more the surface area and volume.\n\nWait, the cross product for the first face ABC was AB \u00d7 AC gave a magnitude of 12\u221a21, so area 6\u221a21. Since all faces are the same, total area 24\u221a21. Volume is 160/3. So 3*(160/3)=160 divided by 24\u221a21 gives 160/(24\u221a21) reduces to 20/(3\u221a21). Then rationalizing gives 20\u221a21 / 63. Yep. So m=20, n=21, p=63. 20+21+63=104.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 104. I think that's correct.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n\n\nGiven a tetrahedron \\(ABCD\\) with edges \\(AB = CD = \\sqrt{41}\\), \\(AC = BD = \\sqrt{80}\\), and \\(BC = AD = \\sqrt{89}\\), we need to find the distance from the incenter to each face, expressed in the form \\(\\frac{m \\sqrt{n}}{p}\\) and compute \\(m + n + p\\).\n\nFirst, we recognize the tetrahedron is a disphenoid, meaning opposite edges are equal. We use coordinates to simplify calculations. Assign coordinates such that:\n- \\(A = (2, \\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(B = (-2, -\\frac{5}{2}, 4)\\)\n- \\(C = (-2, \\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n- \\(D = (2, -\\frac{5}{2}, -4)\\)\n\nWe calculate the vectors:\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{AB} = (-4, -5, 0)\\)\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} = (-4, 0, -8)\\)\n- \\(\\overrightarrow{AD} = (0, -5, -8)\\)\n\nThe volume \\(V\\) is found using the scalar triple product:\n\\[\n\\text{Volume} = \\frac{1}{6} \\left| \\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}) \\right|\n\\]\nCalculating the cross product \\(\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD}\\):\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{AC} \\times \\overrightarrow{AD} = \\begin{vmatrix}\n\\mathbf{i} & \\mathbf{j} & \\mathbf{k} \\\\\n-4 & 0 & -8 \\\\\n0 & -5 & -8\n\\end{vmatrix} = (-40, -32, 20)\n\\]\nDot product with \\(\\overrightarrow{AB}\\):\n\\[\n\\overrightarrow{AB} \\cdot (-40, -32, 20) = (-4)(-40) + (-5)(-32) + 0 \\cdot 20 = 320\n\\]\nThus, the volume is:\n\\[\nV = \\frac{1}{6} \\times 320 = \\frac{160}{3}\n\\]\n\nNext, we compute the surface area. Each face is an equilateral triangle with area \\(6\\sqrt{21}\\). Total surface area \\(A\\) is:\n\\[\nA = 4 \\times 6\\sqrt{21} = 24\\sqrt{21}\n\\]\n\nThe inradius \\(r\\) is given by:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{3V}{A} = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{160}{3}}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{160}{24\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20}{3\\sqrt{21}} = \\frac{20\\sqrt{21}}{63}\n\\]\n\nThus, \\(m = 20\\), \\(n = 21\\), and \\(p = 63\\). Therefore, \\(m + n + p = 20 + 21 + 63 = 104\\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{104}\n\\]",
