      "reasoning_text": "Okay, so I have this problem with two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Let me try to visualize it first. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Hmm, so those four points lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G are all on a circle. That must mean they form a cyclic quadrilateral. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB should be equal to CD, and BC equal to AD. But the problem says BC = 16 and AB = 107, so that would mean CD = 107 and AD = 16. Got it. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG = 17 and EF = 184, so EH = FG = 17, and FG is one side, so maybe FG is the length? Wait, rectangles have opposite sides equal, so EF should be equal to GH, and FG equal to EH. So, EF = 184, so GH is also 184, and FG = 17, so EH =17. \n\nNow, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me sketch this mentally. Let me consider rectangle ABCD. Let me label the rectangle so that AB is the top side, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side. So, points in order: A is top left, B is top right, C is bottom right, D is bottom left. Wait, but then the order of the rectangle would be ABCD going around, so if D is connected to A and C, then yes. So, in this case, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So starting from D, going through E, then C, then F? Wait, but C is a corner of ABCD, so if D, E, C, F are collinear, then the line passes through D, E, C, F in that order? Hmm. Wait, but C is a vertex of ABCD and F is a vertex of EFGH. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is D, E, F, C? But the problem says D,E,C,F are collinear. The order is important here. Since they are collinear, the order could be D-E-C-F or some permutation. Hmm, but since they are all on the same line, perhaps the way the rectangles are placed, let me try to imagine their positions.\n\nSince both rectangles are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear, perhaps the line is horizontal? Let me assume that the line D-E-C-F is a straight line, so maybe the rectangles are placed along this line. Let's see.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to make this easier. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle with AD = 16 (since BC =16, and AD is opposite to BC), then AD would be vertical. Wait, if D is at (0,0), then A would be at (0,16), since AD =16. Then, AB is 107, so moving from A (0,16) to B (107,16). Then, BC is 16 units down to point C (107,0). Wait, but BC is supposed to be 16, which would be the vertical side? Wait, hold on. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are length and width. So if AB is 107, that would be the horizontal side, and BC is vertical with length 16. So yes, so coordinates would be:\n\n- A: (0, 16)\n- B: (107, 16)\n- C: (107, 0)\n- D: (0, 0)\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So the rectangle ABCD has length AB =107 and height BC=16.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH. Let's see. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), the line they are on is the x-axis. So D, E, C, F must all lie on the x-axis. So E and F must also be on the x-axis. Since E and F are vertices of rectangle EFGH, then EFGH must be positioned such that its sides are aligned in some way. Let me try to figure out coordinates for EFGH.\n\nLet me denote E as a point on the x-axis between D and C, or maybe beyond? Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), so if E is between D and C, then moving from D to E to C to F, but F is another point on the line. Wait, but F is part of rectangle EFGH. Let me think.\n\nSince EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are adjacent sides. Given that EF=184 and FG=17. Wait, so EF is one side, FG is another. Since in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if EF is along the x-axis (since E and F are on the x-axis), then FG would be vertical. So if E is at some point (x,0), then F would be at (x + 184, 0) because EF is 184? Wait, but then FG is 17. So from F, moving up or down 17 units. Since it's a rectangle, the direction depends on the orientation. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I should assign coordinates to EFGH. Let me suppose that E is a point on the x-axis. Let's denote E as (e, 0). Since D is (0,0) and C is (107,0), E could be somewhere between D and C, or beyond. Let's see. Since F is also on the x-axis, so F would be another point. Since EF is a side of the rectangle, which is 184 units long. So if E is at (e,0), then F would be at (e + 184, 0), assuming EF is along the x-axis. But FG is 17, so FG is perpendicular to EF, so FG would be vertical. Since rectangles have right angles, so from F, moving up or down 17 units to point G. Similarly, from E, moving in the perpendicular direction to get to H.\n\nBut the problem also mentions that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So H and G are other vertices of rectangle EFGH. Let's see.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates step by step.\n\nLet me suppose that rectangle EFGH has sides EF and FG. Let me suppose that EF is horizontal (along the x-axis), so from E to F is along x-axis. Then FG would be vertical. Since FG =17, so if F is at (e + 184,0), then G would be either (e + 184,17) or (e + 184, -17). Similarly, H would be at (e,17) or (e, -17). Depending on the direction.\n\nBut since A, D, H, G are on a circle, which is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let me see where points A, D, H, G are. A is (0,16), D is (0,0). So we need H and G to be such that all four points lie on a circle.\n\nHmm. Let's consider possible positions. Let me think that maybe the rectangle EFGH is above the x-axis. So G would be above F, so G is (e + 184, 17). Then H would be (e,17). So the rectangle EFGH would have coordinates:\n\n- E: (e, 0)\n- F: (e + 184, 0)\n- G: (e + 184, 17)\n- H: (e, 17)\n\nAlternatively, if it's below, but since A is at (0,16), which is above the x-axis, maybe the rectangle is above to have H and G also above, so that points A, D, H, G can lie on a circle. Let's go with that for now.\n\nSo H is (e,17) and G is (e + 184,17). \n\nNow, points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (e,17), G (e + 184,17) lie on a circle. We need to find e such that these four points are concyclic.\n\nFirst, let's write the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, G.\n\nAlternatively, since three points determine a circle, we can find the condition that the fourth lies on it.\n\nLet me first write coordinates:\n\nA: (0,16)\n\nD: (0,0)\n\nH: (e,17)\n\nG: (e + 184,17)\n\nWe need these four points to lie on a circle. Let's find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, and see if G also lies on it.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), and H(e,17).\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by + c = 0.\n\nPlugging in D(0,0):\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c = 0.\n\nSo the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by = 0.\n\nNow plug in A(0,16):\n\n0 + (16)^2 + 0 + b*(16) = 0 => 256 + 16b = 0 => 16b = -256 => b = -16.\n\nSo now the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax -16y = 0.\n\nNow plug in H(e,17):\n\n(e)^2 + (17)^2 + a*e -16*(17) = 0\n\nSo e\u00b2 + 289 + a e - 272 = 0\n\nSimplify: e\u00b2 + a e + 17 = 0.\n\nHmm, so this gives an equation relating a and e. But we need another condition. Since G(e + 184,17) must lie on the same circle. Let's plug G into the equation.\n\nG(e + 184,17):\n\n(e + 184)^2 + (17)^2 + a*(e + 184) -16*(17) = 0\n\nExpand (e + 184)^2: e\u00b2 + 368 e + (184)^2\n\nSo,\n\ne\u00b2 + 368 e + 184\u00b2 + 289 + a(e + 184) - 272 = 0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst, e\u00b2 + 368e + (184)^2 + 289 - 272 + a e + 184a = 0\n\nCompute constants:\n\n184 squared is 184*184. Let me compute that. 180\u00b2=32400, 4\u00b2=16, and cross term 2*180*4=1440, so (180+4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2 = 32400 + 1440 +16 = 32400+1440=33840+16=33856. So 184\u00b2 is 33856.\n\nThen 289 - 272 = 17. So:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33856 + 17 + a e + 184a = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ne\u00b2 + (368 + a) e + (33856 +17) + 184a =0\n\nWait, 33856 +17 is 33873.\n\nSo,\n\ne\u00b2 + (368 + a)e + 33873 + 184a = 0\n\nBut from the equation when we plugged in H, we had:\n\ne\u00b2 + a e +17 = 0. Let me write that as equation (1):\n\ne\u00b2 + a e = -17.\n\nSo substitute e\u00b2 + a e = -17 into the equation for G's condition.\n\nSo replacing e\u00b2 + a e with -17 in the G equation:\n\n(e\u00b2 + a e) + 368 e + 33873 + 184a =0\n\n=> (-17) + 368 e + 33873 + 184a =0\n\nSimplify constants: -17 + 33873 = 33856\n\nSo,\n\n368 e + 184a + 33856 = 0\n\nHmm, so now we have two equations:\n\nFrom H: e\u00b2 + a e = -17 (equation 1)\n\nFrom G: 368 e + 184a + 33856 = 0 (equation 2)\n\nLet me see if I can express a from equation 1 and substitute into equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 1: e\u00b2 + a e = -17 => a e = -e\u00b2 -17 => a = (-e\u00b2 -17)/e, provided e \u22600.\n\nSo a = -e - 17/e.\n\nNow substitute into equation 2:\n\n368 e + 184*(-e -17/e) + 33856 =0\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n368 e + 184*(-e) + 184*(-17/e) +33856 =0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(368e -184e) - (184*17)/e + 33856 =0\n\nSo 184e - (3128)/e + 33856 =0\n\nMultiply all terms by e to eliminate the denominator:\n\n184e\u00b2 -3128 + 33856 e =0\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nWait, 184e comes from 368e -184e =184e. Then the next term is - (184*17)/e. 184*17 is 3128. So that term is -3128/e. Then plus 33856.\n\nSo when multiplied by e:\n\n184e\u00b2 - 3128 + 33856 e =0 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the equation after multiplying each term by e:\n\nFirst term: 184e * e = 184e\u00b2\n\nSecond term: -3128/e * e = -3128\n\nThird term: 33856 * e = 33856 e\n\nSo altogether:\n\n184e\u00b2 + 33856 e - 3128 =0\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me write it as:\n\n184e\u00b2 + 33856 e - 3128 =0\n\nLet me see if I can factor this equation or simplify it.\n\nFirst, check if all coefficients are divisible by 4.\n\n184 \u00f74 =46, 33856 \u00f74=8464, 3128 \u00f74=782.\n\nSo divide equation by 4:\n\n46e\u00b2 + 8464 e - 782 =0\n\nHmm, maybe further divide by 2:\n\n23e\u00b2 + 4232 e - 391 =0\n\nHmm, that's still a bit messy. Let me check my steps again to see if I made an error in calculation.\n\nStarting from equation 2:\n\nAfter substitution:\n\n368 e + 184a + 184*( -17/e ) + 33856 =0 ?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in equation 2, the term 184a comes from 184 multiplied by a. But in the substitution, a = (-e\u00b2 -17)/e. So 184a is 184*(-e\u00b2 -17)/e. Wait, did I miscalculate that?\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nEquation 2 was:\n\n368e + 184a + 33856 = ?\n\nWait, no, sorry, in the substitution step:\n\nOriginal equation after substituting a into equation 2:\n\n368e + 184*(-e -17/e) +33856 =0\n\nWait, that's 184a term, so 184*( -e -17/e )\n\nYes, so expanding that term gives -184e - (184*17)/e. So that part is correct.\n\nSo proceeding, the equation becomes:\n\n368e -184e - (184*17)/e + 33856 = 0\n\nSo 184e - (3128)/e + 33856 =0\n\nThen multiplying through by e gives:\n\n184e\u00b2 -3128 + 33856 e =0\n\nWait, that's 184e\u00b2 +33856 e -3128 =0. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the quadratic in terms of e is:\n\n184e\u00b2 + 33856 e - 3128 =0.\n\nThis seems very large. Maybe there's an error in the approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the direction of the rectangle. Maybe the rectangle EFGH is below the x-axis? Let me check.\n\nIf I suppose that the rectangle is below the x-axis, then G would be (e+184, -17), and H would be (e, -17). Let me see if that would make things better.\n\nSo in that case, H would be (e, -17), G is (e + 184, -17).\n\nThen points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(e + 184, -17) need to lie on a circle.\n\nLet me try this scenario. Let me recast the equations.\n\nSo again, the circle equation passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(e + 184, -17).\n\nLet me try again.\n\nGeneral equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by + c =0.\n\nPlug in D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 => c=0.\n\nSo equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x + b y =0.\n\nPlug in A(0,16):\n\n0 + 256 +0 +16 b =0 => 256 +16b=0 => b= -16, same as before.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x -16 y =0.\n\nNow plug in H(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + a e -16*(-17)=0\n\ne\u00b2 + 289 + a e + 272 =0\n\nSo e\u00b2 + a e + 561 =0 (since 289+272=561)\n\nSimilarly, plug in G(e+184, -17):\n\n(e +184)^2 + (-17)^2 + a(e +184) -16*(-17)=0\n\nExpand (e +184)^2 = e\u00b2 + 368 e + 184\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\ne\u00b2 + 368 e + 33856 + 289 + a e + 184 a + 272 =0\n\nWait, let's do term by term:\n\n(e+184)^2 = e\u00b2 + 368 e + 184\u00b2 = e\u00b2 +368e + 33856\n\n(-17)^2 = 289\n\na(e +184) = a e +184 a\n\n-16*(-17) = +272\n\nSo altogether:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e +33856 +289 + a e +184 a +272 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ne\u00b2 + (368e + a e) + (33856 +289 +272) +184 a =0\n\nCalculating constants:\n\n33856 +289 = 34145; 34145 +272=34417\n\nSo,\n\ne\u00b2 + e(368 +a) +34417 +184a =0\n\nAgain, from H's equation: e\u00b2 + a e = -561 (since e\u00b2 + a e +561 =0 => e\u00b2 +a e = -561)\n\nSubstitute e\u00b2 +a e = -561 into the equation from G:\n\n(-561) + 368 e + 34417 +184a =0\n\nSimplify constants: -561 +34417 = 33856\n\nSo,\n\n368e +184a +33856 =0\n\nWait, that's exactly the same equation as before when the rectangle was above the x-axis. So regardless of the direction (above or below), the equation ends up the same. Interesting. Therefore, the sign doesn't matter here. So perhaps I can proceed with the same equations.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\nFrom H: e\u00b2 + a e = -561 (if below) or -17 (if above). Wait, no, in the above case when rectangle was above, the H equation was e\u00b2 + a e +17 =0, so e\u00b2 + a e = -17. But when rectangle is below, it was e\u00b2 +a e = -561. Wait, so actually, the equations differ depending on the direction. Wait, but in my first calculation I assumed the rectangle was above, leading to equation e\u00b2 + a e = -17, but in the second scenario (rectangle below), it's e\u00b2 + a e = -561. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the first scenario (rectangle above), H is (e,17):\n\nPlugging into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x -16 y =0\n\nSo for H(e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + a e -16*17 =0\n\nSo e\u00b2 + 289 + a e - 272 =0 \u2192 e\u00b2 + a e +17 =0\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIn the second scenario (rectangle below, H(e,-17)):\n\nH(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + a e -16*(-17) = e\u00b2 +289 +a e +272 = e\u00b2 +a e + 561 =0 \u2192 e\u00b2 +a e = -561.\n\nSo the equations are different based on the direction. Therefore, the equations for G will also differ.\n\nWait, in the second scenario (rectangle below), when plugging G into the equation, we ended up with equation:\n\n368e +184a +33856 =0, same as before? Wait, in the first case (rectangle above):\n\nAfter substituting H's equation into G's equation, we had 368e +184a +33856 =0. In the second scenario (rectangle below), after substitution, we had the same equation? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the first case (above):\n\nWe had from G's equation:\n\n368e +184a +33856 =0\n\nIn the second case (below):\n\nWait, let's redo that step.\n\nIn the second case, after plugging in G(e+184, -17):\n\nThe equation after substituting e\u00b2 +a e = -561 into the G equation gives:\n\n(e\u00b2 + a e) + 368e + 34417 +184a =0\n\nWait, the expansion was:\n\nAfter substitution:\n\n(e\u00b2 + a e) +368e + 34417 +184a =0\n\nBut e\u00b2 + a e = -561, so:\n\n-561 +368e +34417 +184a =0\n\nCompute constants: 34417 -561 = 33856\n\nSo 368e +184a +33856 =0, which is same as the first case. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the direction of the rectangle (above or below the x-axis), the equation 368e +184a +33856 =0 holds, but the equation from point H is different. \n\nTherefore, depending on the direction (above or below), the other equation (from H) is different.\n\nTherefore, in the first case (rectangle above):\n\nEquation1 (H): e\u00b2 +a e = -17\n\nEquation2: 368e +184a +33856=0\n\nIn the second case (rectangle below):\n\nEquation1 (H): e\u00b2 +a e = -561\n\nEquation2: same 368e +184a +33856=0\n\nTherefore, we have two possibilities, but perhaps only one of them gives a valid solution. Let me check both.\n\nFirst, let me try the first case where the rectangle is above the x-axis.\n\nCase 1: Rectangle EFGH above the x-axis.\n\nEquations:\n\n1) e\u00b2 + a e = -17\n\n2) 368e +184a +33856 =0\n\nExpress a from equation1: a = (-e\u00b2 -17)/e\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\n368e +184*(-e\u00b2 -17)/e +33856 =0\n\nMultiply through by e to eliminate denominator:\n\n368e\u00b2 +184*(-e\u00b2 -17) +33856 e =0\n\nExpand:\n\n368e\u00b2 -184e\u00b2 - (184*17) +33856 e =0\n\nCompute:\n\n(368e\u00b2 -184e\u00b2)=184e\u00b2\n\n184*17 = 3128\n\nSo:\n\n184e\u00b2 -3128 +33856 e =0\n\nSame equation as before: 184e\u00b2 +33856e -3128 =0\n\nDivide all terms by 4 to simplify:\n\n46e\u00b2 +8464e -782 =0\n\nHmm, perhaps divide again by 2: 23e\u00b2 +4232e -391 =0\n\nThis quadratic equation seems difficult to factor. Let me compute discriminant D:\n\nD = (4232)^2 -4*23*(-391)\n\nThat's going to be a huge number. Let me compute:\n\nFirst, 4232 squared:\n\nWell, 4232^2 = (4000 +232)^2 = 4000\u00b2 + 2*4000*232 +232\u00b2\n\n4000\u00b2 =16,000,000\n\n2*4000*232 =8000*232 = let's compute 8000*200=1,600,000; 8000*32=256,000 \u2192 total 1,856,000\n\n232\u00b2 = 232*232. Let me compute 200\u00b2 + 2*200*32 +32\u00b2 =40,000 + 12,800 + 1,024= 53,824\n\nSo total D=16,000,000 +1,856,000 +53,824 = 16,000,000 + 1,909,824 = 17,909,824\n\nThen 4*23*391 = 92*391. Let's compute that:\n\n92*400=36,800; subtract 92*9=828 \u2192 36,800 -828=35,972. Wait, but since it's -4*23*(-391)=+4*23*391, so D is 17,909,824 +35,972=17,945,796\n\nThen sqrt(D)=sqrt(17,945,796). Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe 4236? Let me check 4236^2: 4200\u00b2=17,640,000, plus 2*4200*36 +36\u00b2= 17,640,000 + 302,400 + 1,296=17,943,696. Close. 4236\u00b2=17,943,696. The D is 17,945,796, so difference is 17,945,796-17,943,696=2,100. Hmm, not a perfect square. So perhaps this case (rectangle above) does not yield integer solutions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction. Let me try the second case where the rectangle is below the x-axis.\n\nCase 2: Rectangle EFGH below the x-axis.\n\nEquations:\n\n1) e\u00b2 + a e = -561\n\n2) 368e +184a +33856 =0\n\nAgain, solve for a from equation1:\n\na = (-e\u00b2 -561)/e\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\n368e +184*(-e\u00b2 -561)/e +33856 =0\n\nMultiply through by e:\n\n368e\u00b2 +184*(-e\u00b2 -561) +33856 e =0\n\nExpand:\n\n368e\u00b2 -184e\u00b2 -184*561 +33856 e =0\n\nCompute terms:\n\n368e\u00b2 -184e\u00b2 =184e\u00b2\n\n184*561: Let's compute 180*561= 100,980 and 4*561=2,244 \u2192 total 100,980 +2,244=103,224\n\nSo,\n\n184e\u00b2 -103,224 +33856 e =0\n\nRearranged:\n\n184e\u00b2 +33856 e -103,224 =0\n\nAgain, perhaps divide by 4 to simplify:\n\n46e\u00b2 +8464 e -25,806 =0\n\nHmm, still not so nice. Let me compute discriminant here.\n\nD= (8464)^2 -4*46*(-25,806)\n\nCompute D:\n\nFirst term: 8464^2. That's a huge number. Let me see if this might be a perfect square?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe there is a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of coordinates, use power of a point or cyclic quadrilateral properties?\n\nGiven that A, D, H, G are concyclic, so the power of point C with respect to the circle might be involved? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since AD is a side of the rectangle and D is on the circle, but maybe using cyclic quadrilateral properties: the product of the slopes or something?\n\nAlternatively, since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, the power of point E with respect to the circle? Wait, but E is a point on the x-axis, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps inversion? Maybe overkill.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that AD and HG are both vertical or horizontal? Wait, in the coordinate system I set, AD is vertical (from (0,0) to (0,16)), and if the rectangle EFGH is placed such that HG is horizontal?\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, HG would be horizontal if the rectangle is above or below. Wait, in the rectangle EFGH, HG is opposite to EF, so since EF is horizontal (along x-axis), HG is also horizontal, so yes.\n\nWait, so HG is horizontal. So the points H and G have the same y-coordinate. Since in the above case, H was at (e,17) and G at (e+184,17), so yes, horizontal. So the line HG is horizontal at y=17 or y=-17.\n\nPoints A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, y), G(e+184,y) lie on a circle. Let me consider that.\n\nThe general equation of a circle through A(0,16), D(0,0), and two other points H and G which are horizontally aligned at (e,y) and (e+184,y). Maybe there is symmetry here?\n\nLet me consider the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), and points H(e,y) and G(e +184,y). Since H and G are symmetric with respect to the vertical line x = e + 92 (since they are 184 apart). So the center of the circle might lie on that vertical line?\n\nAlternatively, since points H and G are symmetric across x = e +92, the circle's center must lie on that vertical line. Also, the circle passes through A and D, which are on the y-axis. Let me see.\n\nLet me suppose the center is at (h, k). Since the circle passes through (0,16) and (0,0):\n\nThe distance from center (h,k) to (0,16) equals to distance to (0,0) and to H(e,y) and G(e+184,y).\n\nSo:\n\n(h - 0)^2 + (k -16)^2 = (h -0)^2 + (k -0)^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(h\u00b2 + (k-16)^2 ) = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)\n\nSubtract h\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(k -16)^2 = k\u00b2 \u2192 expanding: k\u00b2 -32k +256 =k\u00b2 \u2192 -32k +256 =0 \u2192 32k =256 \u2192 k=8.\n\nSo the center is at (h,8). The y-coordinate is 8.\n\nAlso, since the center is at (h,8), and it's equidistant to H(e,y) and G(e+184,y). The distance to both H and G must be the same, so:\n\nThe distance from (h,8) to (e,y): sqrt( (h - e)^2 + (8 - y)^2 )\n\nTo (e+184,y): sqrt( (h - (e+184))^2 + (8 - y)^2 )\n\nSet equal:\n\n(h - e)^2 = (h - e -184)^2\n\nExpand right side:\n\n(h - e)^2 - 368(h - e) + 184\u00b2 = (h - e)^2\n\nSubtract (h - e)^2 from both sides:\n\n-368(h - e) + 184\u00b2 =0 \u2192 -368(h -e ) = -184\u00b2 \u2192 h - e = (184\u00b2)/368\n\nCompute 184\u00b2=33856, so 33856 /368. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 16: 33856/16=2116; 368/16=23. So 2116/23. Let's divide 2116 \u00f723. 23*90=2070, 2116-2070=46, 46/23=2. So total 92. So h -e=92 \u2192 h =e +92.\n\nTherefore, the center is at (e +92,8). \n\nNow, since the center is at (e+92,8), the distance to point D(0,0) must equal the radius. Let's compute radius squared:\n\nDistance from center to D: (e+92 -0)^2 + (8 -0)^2 = (e+92)^2 +64.\n\nSimilarly, distance to A(0,16):\n\n(e+92)^2 + (8 -16)^2 = (e+92)^2 + (-8)^2 = (e+92)^2 +64. Wait, that's the same as distance to D? Wait, but that can't be, unless the radius is the same, which it is, since both points are on the circle. So that checks out.\n\nNow, the distance from center to H(e,y):\n\nsqrt( ( (e+92 -e)^2 + (8 - y)^2 )) = sqrt(92\u00b2 + (8 - y)^2 )\n\nThis must equal the radius squared:\n\n(92)^2 + (8 - y)^2 = (e +92)^2 +64.\n\nExpand the right side: (e^2 + 184 e + 92\u00b2) +64.\n\nSo,\n\n92\u00b2 + (8 - y)^2 = e\u00b2 +184e +92\u00b2 +64\n\nSubtract 92\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(8 - y)^2 = e\u00b2 +184e +64\n\nSo,\n\n(8 - y)^2 = e\u00b2 +184e +64. (Equation A)\n\nSimilarly, since the rectangle EFGH has FG=17, which is the vertical side. Since in the coordinate system, if the rectangle is above the x-axis, then y=17. If below, y=-17.\n\nLet me consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: Rectangle above x-axis, so y=17.\n\nThen (8 -17)^2 = (-9)^2 =81.\n\nSo equation A: 81 = e\u00b2 +184e +64 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184e +64 -81 =0 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184e -17 =0\n\nSolving quadratic equation: e\u00b2 +184e -17=0\n\nDiscriminant D=184\u00b2 +68= (184)^2 +68. Wait, D=184\u00b2 +4*1*17= 184\u00b2 +68. Wait, actually, for equation e\u00b2 +184e -17=0, discriminant D= (184)^2 -4*1*(-17)= 184\u00b2 +68.\n\nCalculate 184\u00b2: 184*184=33,856. So D=33,856 +68=33,924. sqrt(33,924). Let me see: 184^2 is 33,856, so sqrt(33,924)=sqrt(33,856 +68)= approx 184.18? Not an integer. Hmm, so this would lead to irrational e, which is possible but maybe not desired?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rectangle is below, so y=-17.\n\nCase2: Rectangle below x-axis, so y= -17.\n\nThen (8 - (-17))^2 = (25)^2=625.\n\nEquation A: 625 = e\u00b2 +184e +64 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184e +64 -625=0 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184e -561=0\n\nCompute discriminant D=184\u00b2 -4*1*(-561)= 33,856 +2,244=36,100. sqrt(36,100)=190. Because 190\u00b2=36,100. Perfect square!\n\nTherefore, e = [-184 \u00b1190]/2\n\nSo two solutions:\n\ne = (-184 +190)/2 =6/2=3\n\nor e=(-184-190)/2= -374/2= -187\n\nSo e=3 or e=-187.\n\nNow, we need to see which one makes sense in the problem.\n\nFirst, e is the x-coordinate of point E on the x-axis, between D(0,0) and C(107,0) or beyond.\n\nIf e=3, then E is at (3,0), which is between D(0,0) and C(107,0). That's possible.\n\nIf e= -187, then E is at (-187,0), which is to the left of D(0,0). Since the problem says \"rectangles are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear\", but it doesn't specify the order. If E is to the left of D, then the order would be E,D,C,F, but then F would be at e +184= -187 +184= -3. So F would be at (-3,0), still left of D. But C is at (107,0). So the points would be E(-187,0), D(0,0), C(107,0), F(-3,0)? Wait, no, F would be at e +184= -187+184= -3, which is between E and D, but C is at 107. So the order would be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). So D,E,C,F are collinear in the order E,F,D,C? But the problem states D,E,C,F are collinear. So the order must include D,E,C,F in that order on the line. So if E is to the left of D, then the order would be E, D, C, F? But F would be at e +184= -187+184= -3, which is between E and D, so actually the order would be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). So D comes after F. So the given order D,E,C,F would not hold unless the points are arranged with D first, but E is left of D, so that's impossible. Hence e=-187 would mean the order can't have D first. Thus e=-187 is invalid based on the problem's collinearity order D,E,C,F.\n\nTherefore, e=3 is the valid solution.\n\nTherefore, e=3.\n\nThus, point E is at (3,0). The length CE is the distance from C(107,0) to E(3,0), which is 107 -3 =104.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Since C is at (107,0) and E is at (3,0), so CE is 107-3=104. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the coordinates. If e=3, then rectangle EFGH has E(3,0), F(3+184,0)=F(187,0). Wait, but F is supposed to be collinear with D,E,C,F. But C is at (107,0). So the points D(0,0), E(3,0), C(107,0), F(187,0). So they are collinear in order D,E,C,F along the x-axis. Perfect, that fits the problem's condition.\n\nTherefore, CE is the distance from C(107,0) to E(3,0) which is 107 -3 =104. So the answer should be 104.\n\nWait, but let me check with the circle condition to be thorough. Let's confirm that points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, y), G(e+184,y) lie on a circle when e=3 and y=-17 (since we considered the rectangle below the x-axis in this case).\n\nSo H is at (3, -17) and G is at (3+184, -17)= (187, -17).\n\nNow, let's verify if these four points lie on a circle.\n\nWe can use the earlier center found: center at (e+92,8) which would be (3+92,8)= (95,8).\n\nRadius squared is (95)^2 +8^2 (distance from center to D(0,0)):\n\n95\u00b2 +8\u00b2= 9025 +64=9089\n\nCheck distance from center (95,8) to A(0,16):\n\nsqrt( (95)^2 + (8-16)^2 )= sqrt(9025 +64)=sqrt(9089), same as radius.\n\nDistance to H(3,-17):\n\nsqrt( (95-3)^2 + (8 - (-17))^2 )= sqrt(92\u00b2 +25\u00b2)= sqrt(8464 +625)= sqrt(9089), same.\n\nDistance to G(187, -17):\n\nsqrt( (187-95)^2 + (8 - (-17))^2 )= sqrt(92\u00b2 +25\u00b2)= same as above. So yes, all points lie on the circle. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the length CE is 104.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't mix up the cases. Because when I considered the rectangle below the x-axis, we had y=-17, so that's correct. And with e=3, everything works out. So the answer is 104. \n\nBut let me check if there was any miscalculation when solving for e in the second case:\n\nIn case 2 (y=-17):\n\nEquation A: 625 = e\u00b2 +184e +64 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184e -561=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1\u221a(184\u00b2 +4*561)]/2\n\nWait, discriminant D=184\u00b2 +4*561. Wait, no, equation is e\u00b2 +184e -561=0, so discriminant is (184)^2 -4*1*(-561)= 184\u00b2 +4*561.\n\nWait, 184\u00b2 is 33,856; 4*561=2,244. So D=33,856 +2,244=36,100. sqrt(36,100)=190. So yes, e=(-184 \u00b1190)/2.\n\nSo yes, e=(6)/2=3 or e=(-374)/2=-187. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct value is 3, so CE is 107-3=104. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, so I have this problem with two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. Let me try to visualize it first. The problem says that points D, E, C, F are collinear. Hmm, so those four points lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G are all on a circle. That must mean they form a cyclic quadrilateral. The given lengths are BC=16, AB=107, FG=17, and EF=184. I need to find the length of CE. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So, AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Wait, actually, in a rectangle, opposite sides are equal, so AB should be equal to CD, and BC equal to AD. But the problem says BC = 16 and AB = 107, so that would mean CD = 107 and AD = 16. Got it. Similarly, for rectangle EFGH, FG = 17 and EF = 184, so EH = FG = 17, and FG is one side, so maybe FG is the length? Wait, rectangles have opposite sides equal, so EF should be equal to GH, and FG equal to EH. So, EF = 184, so GH is also 184, and FG = 17, so EH =17. \n\nNow, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me sketch this mentally. Let me consider rectangle ABCD. Let me label the rectangle so that AB is the top side, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side. So, points in order: A is top left, B is top right, C is bottom right, D is bottom left. Wait, but then the order of the rectangle would be ABCD going around, so if D is connected to A and C, then yes. So, in this case, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. So starting from D, going through E, then C, then F? Wait, but C is a corner of ABCD, so if D, E, C, F are collinear, then the line passes through D, E, C, F in that order? Hmm. Wait, but C is a vertex of ABCD and F is a vertex of EFGH. Let me think.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is D, E, F, C? But the problem says D,E,C,F are collinear. The order is important here. Since they are collinear, the order could be D-E-C-F or some permutation. Hmm, but since they are all on the same line, perhaps the way the rectangles are placed, let me try to imagine their positions.\n\nSince both rectangles are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear, perhaps the line is horizontal? Let me assume that the line D-E-C-F is a straight line, so maybe the rectangles are placed along this line. Let's see.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates to make this easier. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle with AD = 16 (since BC =16, and AD is opposite to BC), then AD would be vertical. Wait, if D is at (0,0), then A would be at (0,16), since AD =16. Then, AB is 107, so moving from A (0,16) to B (107,16). Then, BC is 16 units down to point C (107,0). Wait, but BC is supposed to be 16, which would be the vertical side? Wait, hold on. Wait, in a rectangle, adjacent sides are length and width. So if AB is 107, that would be the horizontal side, and BC is vertical with length 16. So yes, so coordinates would be:\n\n- A: (0, 16)\n- B: (107, 16)\n- C: (107, 0)\n- D: (0, 0)\n\nOkay, that makes sense. So the rectangle ABCD has length AB =107 and height BC=16.\n\nNow, rectangle EFGH. Let's see. The points D, E, C, F are collinear. Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), the line they are on is the x-axis. So D, E, C, F must all lie on the x-axis. So E and F must also be on the x-axis. Since E and F are vertices of rectangle EFGH, then EFGH must be positioned such that its sides are aligned in some way. Let me try to figure out coordinates for EFGH.\n\nLet me denote E as a point on the x-axis between D and C, or maybe beyond? Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), so if E is between D and C, then moving from D to E to C to F, but F is another point on the line. Wait, but F is part of rectangle EFGH. Let me think.\n\nSince EFGH is a rectangle, the sides EF and FG are adjacent sides. Given that EF=184 and FG=17. Wait, so EF is one side, FG is another. Since in a rectangle, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So if EF is along the x-axis (since E and F are on the x-axis), then FG would be vertical. So if E is at some point (x,0), then F would be at (x + 184, 0) because EF is 184? Wait, but then FG is 17. So from F, moving up or down 17 units. Since it's a rectangle, the direction depends on the orientation. Let's see.\n\nWait, maybe I should assign coordinates to EFGH. Let me suppose that E is a point on the x-axis. Let's denote E as (e, 0). Since D is (0,0) and C is (107,0), E could be somewhere between D and C, or beyond. Let's see. Since F is also on the x-axis, so F would be another point. Since EF is a side of the rectangle, which is 184 units long. So if E is at (e,0), then F would be at (e + 184, 0), assuming EF is along the x-axis. But FG is 17, so FG is perpendicular to EF, so FG would be vertical. Since rectangles have right angles, so from F, moving up or down 17 units to point G. Similarly, from E, moving in the perpendicular direction to get to H.\n\nBut the problem also mentions that points A, D, H, G lie on a circle. So H and G are other vertices of rectangle EFGH. Let's see.\n\nLet me try to assign coordinates step by step.\n\nLet me suppose that rectangle EFGH has sides EF and FG. Let me suppose that EF is horizontal (along the x-axis), so from E to F is along x-axis. Then FG would be vertical. Since FG =17, so if F is at (e + 184,0), then G would be either (e + 184,17) or (e + 184, -17). Similarly, H would be at (e,17) or (e, -17). Depending on the direction.\n\nBut since A, D, H, G are on a circle, which is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let me see where points A, D, H, G are. A is (0,16), D is (0,0). So we need H and G to be such that all four points lie on a circle.\n\nHmm. Let's consider possible positions. Let me think that maybe the rectangle EFGH is above the x-axis. So G would be above F, so G is (e + 184, 17). Then H would be (e,17). So the rectangle EFGH would have coordinates:\n\n- E: (e, 0)\n- F: (e + 184, 0)\n- G: (e + 184, 17)\n- H: (e, 17)\n\nAlternatively, if it's below, but since A is at (0,16), which is above the x-axis, maybe the rectangle is above to have H and G also above, so that points A, D, H, G can lie on a circle. Let's go with that for now.\n\nSo H is (e,17) and G is (e + 184,17). \n\nNow, points A (0,16), D (0,0), H (e,17), G (e + 184,17) lie on a circle. We need to find e such that these four points are concyclic.\n\nFirst, let's write the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, G.\n\nAlternatively, since three points determine a circle, we can find the condition that the fourth lies on it.\n\nLet me first write coordinates:\n\nA: (0,16)\n\nD: (0,0)\n\nH: (e,17)\n\nG: (e + 184,17)\n\nWe need these four points to lie on a circle. Let's find the equation of the circle passing through A, D, H, and see if G also lies on it.\n\nFirst, let's find the equation of the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), and H(e,17).\n\nThe general equation of a circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by + c = 0.\n\nPlugging in D(0,0):\n\n0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + c = 0 => c = 0.\n\nSo the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by = 0.\n\nNow plug in A(0,16):\n\n0 + (16)^2 + 0 + b*(16) = 0 => 256 + 16b = 0 => 16b = -256 => b = -16.\n\nSo now the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax -16y = 0.\n\nNow plug in H(e,17):\n\n(e)^2 + (17)^2 + a*e -16*(17) = 0\n\nSo e\u00b2 + 289 + a e - 272 = 0\n\nSimplify: e\u00b2 + a e + 17 = 0.\n\nHmm, so this gives an equation relating a and e. But we need another condition. Since G(e + 184,17) must lie on the same circle. Let's plug G into the equation.\n\nG(e + 184,17):\n\n(e + 184)^2 + (17)^2 + a*(e + 184) -16*(17) = 0\n\nExpand (e + 184)^2: e\u00b2 + 368 e + (184)^2\n\nSo,\n\ne\u00b2 + 368 e + 184\u00b2 + 289 + a(e + 184) - 272 = 0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst, e\u00b2 + 368e + (184)^2 + 289 - 272 + a e + 184a = 0\n\nCompute constants:\n\n184 squared is 184*184. Let me compute that. 180\u00b2=32400, 4\u00b2=16, and cross term 2*180*4=1440, so (180+4)^2 = 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 +4\u00b2 = 32400 + 1440 +16 = 32400+1440=33840+16=33856. So 184\u00b2 is 33856.\n\nThen 289 - 272 = 17. So:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e + 33856 + 17 + a e + 184a = 0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ne\u00b2 + (368 + a) e + (33856 +17) + 184a =0\n\nWait, 33856 +17 is 33873.\n\nSo,\n\ne\u00b2 + (368 + a)e + 33873 + 184a = 0\n\nBut from the equation when we plugged in H, we had:\n\ne\u00b2 + a e +17 = 0. Let me write that as equation (1):\n\ne\u00b2 + a e = -17.\n\nSo substitute e\u00b2 + a e = -17 into the equation for G's condition.\n\nSo replacing e\u00b2 + a e with -17 in the G equation:\n\n(e\u00b2 + a e) + 368 e + 33873 + 184a =0\n\n=> (-17) + 368 e + 33873 + 184a =0\n\nSimplify constants: -17 + 33873 = 33856\n\nSo,\n\n368 e + 184a + 33856 = 0\n\nHmm, so now we have two equations:\n\nFrom H: e\u00b2 + a e = -17 (equation 1)\n\nFrom G: 368 e + 184a + 33856 = 0 (equation 2)\n\nLet me see if I can express a from equation 1 and substitute into equation 2.\n\nFrom equation 1: e\u00b2 + a e = -17 => a e = -e\u00b2 -17 => a = (-e\u00b2 -17)/e, provided e \u22600.\n\nSo a = -e - 17/e.\n\nNow substitute into equation 2:\n\n368 e + 184*(-e -17/e) + 33856 =0\n\nCompute term by term:\n\n368 e + 184*(-e) + 184*(-17/e) +33856 =0\n\nSimplify:\n\n(368e -184e) - (184*17)/e + 33856 =0\n\nSo 184e - (3128)/e + 33856 =0\n\nMultiply all terms by e to eliminate the denominator:\n\n184e\u00b2 -3128 + 33856 e =0\n\nWait, let me check again:\n\nWait, 184e comes from 368e -184e =184e. Then the next term is - (184*17)/e. 184*17 is 3128. So that term is -3128/e. Then plus 33856.\n\nSo when multiplied by e:\n\n184e\u00b2 - 3128 + 33856 e =0 ?\n\nWait, no. Wait, the equation after multiplying each term by e:\n\nFirst term: 184e * e = 184e\u00b2\n\nSecond term: -3128/e * e = -3128\n\nThird term: 33856 * e = 33856 e\n\nSo altogether:\n\n184e\u00b2 + 33856 e - 3128 =0\n\nHmm, that seems a bit complicated, but let me write it as:\n\n184e\u00b2 + 33856 e - 3128 =0\n\nLet me see if I can factor this equation or simplify it.\n\nFirst, check if all coefficients are divisible by 4.\n\n184 \u00f74 =46, 33856 \u00f74=8464, 3128 \u00f74=782.\n\nSo divide equation by 4:\n\n46e\u00b2 + 8464 e - 782 =0\n\nHmm, maybe further divide by 2:\n\n23e\u00b2 + 4232 e - 391 =0\n\nHmm, that's still a bit messy. Let me check my steps again to see if I made an error in calculation.\n\nStarting from equation 2:\n\nAfter substitution:\n\n368 e + 184a + 184*( -17/e ) + 33856 =0 ?\n\nWait, hold on. Wait, in equation 2, the term 184a comes from 184 multiplied by a. But in the substitution, a = (-e\u00b2 -17)/e. So 184a is 184*(-e\u00b2 -17)/e. Wait, did I miscalculate that?\n\nWait, let me retrace:\n\nEquation 2 was:\n\n368e + 184a + 33856 = ?\n\nWait, no, sorry, in the substitution step:\n\nOriginal equation after substituting a into equation 2:\n\n368e + 184*(-e -17/e) +33856 =0\n\nWait, that's 184a term, so 184*( -e -17/e )\n\nYes, so expanding that term gives -184e - (184*17)/e. So that part is correct.\n\nSo proceeding, the equation becomes:\n\n368e -184e - (184*17)/e + 33856 = 0\n\nSo 184e - (3128)/e + 33856 =0\n\nThen multiplying through by e gives:\n\n184e\u00b2 -3128 + 33856 e =0\n\nWait, that's 184e\u00b2 +33856 e -3128 =0. So that's correct.\n\nHmm, so the quadratic in terms of e is:\n\n184e\u00b2 + 33856 e - 3128 =0.\n\nThis seems very large. Maybe there's an error in the approach?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a wrong assumption in the direction of the rectangle. Maybe the rectangle EFGH is below the x-axis? Let me check.\n\nIf I suppose that the rectangle is below the x-axis, then G would be (e+184, -17), and H would be (e, -17). Let me see if that would make things better.\n\nSo in that case, H would be (e, -17), G is (e + 184, -17).\n\nThen points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(e + 184, -17) need to lie on a circle.\n\nLet me try this scenario. Let me recast the equations.\n\nSo again, the circle equation passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, -17), G(e + 184, -17).\n\nLet me try again.\n\nGeneral equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by + c =0.\n\nPlug in D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 => c=0.\n\nSo equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x + b y =0.\n\nPlug in A(0,16):\n\n0 + 256 +0 +16 b =0 => 256 +16b=0 => b= -16, same as before.\n\nSo equation becomes x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x -16 y =0.\n\nNow plug in H(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + a e -16*(-17)=0\n\ne\u00b2 + 289 + a e + 272 =0\n\nSo e\u00b2 + a e + 561 =0 (since 289+272=561)\n\nSimilarly, plug in G(e+184, -17):\n\n(e +184)^2 + (-17)^2 + a(e +184) -16*(-17)=0\n\nExpand (e +184)^2 = e\u00b2 + 368 e + 184\u00b2\n\nSo,\n\ne\u00b2 + 368 e + 33856 + 289 + a e + 184 a + 272 =0\n\nWait, let's do term by term:\n\n(e+184)^2 = e\u00b2 + 368 e + 184\u00b2 = e\u00b2 +368e + 33856\n\n(-17)^2 = 289\n\na(e +184) = a e +184 a\n\n-16*(-17) = +272\n\nSo altogether:\n\ne\u00b2 + 368e +33856 +289 + a e +184 a +272 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\ne\u00b2 + (368e + a e) + (33856 +289 +272) +184 a =0\n\nCalculating constants:\n\n33856 +289 = 34145; 34145 +272=34417\n\nSo,\n\ne\u00b2 + e(368 +a) +34417 +184a =0\n\nAgain, from H's equation: e\u00b2 + a e = -561 (since e\u00b2 + a e +561 =0 => e\u00b2 +a e = -561)\n\nSubstitute e\u00b2 +a e = -561 into the equation from G:\n\n(-561) + 368 e + 34417 +184a =0\n\nSimplify constants: -561 +34417 = 33856\n\nSo,\n\n368e +184a +33856 =0\n\nWait, that's exactly the same equation as before when the rectangle was above the x-axis. So regardless of the direction (above or below), the equation ends up the same. Interesting. Therefore, the sign doesn't matter here. So perhaps I can proceed with the same equations.\n\nSo, the equations are:\n\nFrom H: e\u00b2 + a e = -561 (if below) or -17 (if above). Wait, no, in the above case when rectangle was above, the H equation was e\u00b2 + a e +17 =0, so e\u00b2 + a e = -17. But when rectangle is below, it was e\u00b2 +a e = -561. Wait, so actually, the equations differ depending on the direction. Wait, but in my first calculation I assumed the rectangle was above, leading to equation e\u00b2 + a e = -17, but in the second scenario (rectangle below), it's e\u00b2 + a e = -561. So which is correct?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in the first scenario (rectangle above), H is (e,17):\n\nPlugging into the circle equation:\n\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x -16 y =0\n\nSo for H(e,17):\n\ne\u00b2 + 17\u00b2 + a e -16*17 =0\n\nSo e\u00b2 + 289 + a e - 272 =0 \u2192 e\u00b2 + a e +17 =0\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nIn the second scenario (rectangle below, H(e,-17)):\n\nH(e, -17):\n\ne\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + a e -16*(-17) = e\u00b2 +289 +a e +272 = e\u00b2 +a e + 561 =0 \u2192 e\u00b2 +a e = -561.\n\nSo the equations are different based on the direction. Therefore, the equations for G will also differ.\n\nWait, in the second scenario (rectangle below), when plugging G into the equation, we ended up with equation:\n\n368e +184a +33856 =0, same as before? Wait, in the first case (rectangle above):\n\nAfter substituting H's equation into G's equation, we had 368e +184a +33856 =0. In the second scenario (rectangle below), after substitution, we had the same equation? Wait, let me check again.\n\nWait, in the first case (above):\n\nWe had from G's equation:\n\n368e +184a +33856 =0\n\nIn the second case (below):\n\nWait, let's redo that step.\n\nIn the second case, after plugging in G(e+184, -17):\n\nThe equation after substituting e\u00b2 +a e = -561 into the G equation gives:\n\n(e\u00b2 + a e) + 368e + 34417 +184a =0\n\nWait, the expansion was:\n\nAfter substitution:\n\n(e\u00b2 + a e) +368e + 34417 +184a =0\n\nBut e\u00b2 + a e = -561, so:\n\n-561 +368e +34417 +184a =0\n\nCompute constants: 34417 -561 = 33856\n\nSo 368e +184a +33856 =0, which is same as the first case. \n\nTherefore, regardless of the direction of the rectangle (above or below the x-axis), the equation 368e +184a +33856 =0 holds, but the equation from point H is different. \n\nTherefore, depending on the direction (above or below), the other equation (from H) is different.\n\nTherefore, in the first case (rectangle above):\n\nEquation1 (H): e\u00b2 +a e = -17\n\nEquation2: 368e +184a +33856=0\n\nIn the second case (rectangle below):\n\nEquation1 (H): e\u00b2 +a e = -561\n\nEquation2: same 368e +184a +33856=0\n\nTherefore, we have two possibilities, but perhaps only one of them gives a valid solution. Let me check both.\n\nFirst, let me try the first case where the rectangle is above the x-axis.\n\nCase 1: Rectangle EFGH above the x-axis.\n\nEquations:\n\n1) e\u00b2 + a e = -17\n\n2) 368e +184a +33856 =0\n\nExpress a from equation1: a = (-e\u00b2 -17)/e\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\n368e +184*(-e\u00b2 -17)/e +33856 =0\n\nMultiply through by e to eliminate denominator:\n\n368e\u00b2 +184*(-e\u00b2 -17) +33856 e =0\n\nExpand:\n\n368e\u00b2 -184e\u00b2 - (184*17) +33856 e =0\n\nCompute:\n\n(368e\u00b2 -184e\u00b2)=184e\u00b2\n\n184*17 = 3128\n\nSo:\n\n184e\u00b2 -3128 +33856 e =0\n\nSame equation as before: 184e\u00b2 +33856e -3128 =0\n\nDivide all terms by 4 to simplify:\n\n46e\u00b2 +8464e -782 =0\n\nHmm, perhaps divide again by 2: 23e\u00b2 +4232e -391 =0\n\nThis quadratic equation seems difficult to factor. Let me compute discriminant D:\n\nD = (4232)^2 -4*23*(-391)\n\nThat's going to be a huge number. Let me compute:\n\nFirst, 4232 squared:\n\nWell, 4232^2 = (4000 +232)^2 = 4000\u00b2 + 2*4000*232 +232\u00b2\n\n4000\u00b2 =16,000,000\n\n2*4000*232 =8000*232 = let's compute 8000*200=1,600,000; 8000*32=256,000 \u2192 total 1,856,000\n\n232\u00b2 = 232*232. Let me compute 200\u00b2 + 2*200*32 +32\u00b2 =40,000 + 12,800 + 1,024= 53,824\n\nSo total D=16,000,000 +1,856,000 +53,824 = 16,000,000 + 1,909,824 = 17,909,824\n\nThen 4*23*391 = 92*391. Let's compute that:\n\n92*400=36,800; subtract 92*9=828 \u2192 36,800 -828=35,972. Wait, but since it's -4*23*(-391)=+4*23*391, so D is 17,909,824 +35,972=17,945,796\n\nThen sqrt(D)=sqrt(17,945,796). Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe 4236? Let me check 4236^2: 4200\u00b2=17,640,000, plus 2*4200*36 +36\u00b2= 17,640,000 + 302,400 + 1,296=17,943,696. Close. 4236\u00b2=17,943,696. The D is 17,945,796, so difference is 17,945,796-17,943,696=2,100. Hmm, not a perfect square. So perhaps this case (rectangle above) does not yield integer solutions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the direction. Let me try the second case where the rectangle is below the x-axis.\n\nCase 2: Rectangle EFGH below the x-axis.\n\nEquations:\n\n1) e\u00b2 + a e = -561\n\n2) 368e +184a +33856 =0\n\nAgain, solve for a from equation1:\n\na = (-e\u00b2 -561)/e\n\nSubstitute into equation2:\n\n368e +184*(-e\u00b2 -561)/e +33856 =0\n\nMultiply through by e:\n\n368e\u00b2 +184*(-e\u00b2 -561) +33856 e =0\n\nExpand:\n\n368e\u00b2 -184e\u00b2 -184*561 +33856 e =0\n\nCompute terms:\n\n368e\u00b2 -184e\u00b2 =184e\u00b2\n\n184*561: Let's compute 180*561= 100,980 and 4*561=2,244 \u2192 total 100,980 +2,244=103,224\n\nSo,\n\n184e\u00b2 -103,224 +33856 e =0\n\nRearranged:\n\n184e\u00b2 +33856 e -103,224 =0\n\nAgain, perhaps divide by 4 to simplify:\n\n46e\u00b2 +8464 e -25,806 =0\n\nHmm, still not so nice. Let me compute discriminant here.\n\nD= (8464)^2 -4*46*(-25,806)\n\nCompute D:\n\nFirst term: 8464^2. That's a huge number. Let me see if this might be a perfect square?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach. Maybe there is a smarter way.\n\nWait, perhaps instead of coordinates, use power of a point or cyclic quadrilateral properties?\n\nGiven that A, D, H, G are concyclic, so the power of point C with respect to the circle might be involved? Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since AD is a side of the rectangle and D is on the circle, but maybe using cyclic quadrilateral properties: the product of the slopes or something?\n\nAlternatively, since A, D, H, G lie on a circle, the power of point E with respect to the circle? Wait, but E is a point on the x-axis, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps inversion? Maybe overkill.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the key is that AD and HG are both vertical or horizontal? Wait, in the coordinate system I set, AD is vertical (from (0,0) to (0,16)), and if the rectangle EFGH is placed such that HG is horizontal?\n\nWait, in the coordinate system, HG would be horizontal if the rectangle is above or below. Wait, in the rectangle EFGH, HG is opposite to EF, so since EF is horizontal (along x-axis), HG is also horizontal, so yes.\n\nWait, so HG is horizontal. So the points H and G have the same y-coordinate. Since in the above case, H was at (e,17) and G at (e+184,17), so yes, horizontal. So the line HG is horizontal at y=17 or y=-17.\n\nPoints A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, y), G(e+184,y) lie on a circle. Let me consider that.\n\nThe general equation of a circle through A(0,16), D(0,0), and two other points H and G which are horizontally aligned at (e,y) and (e+184,y). Maybe there is symmetry here?\n\nLet me consider the circle passing through A(0,16), D(0,0), and points H(e,y) and G(e +184,y). Since H and G are symmetric with respect to the vertical line x = e + 92 (since they are 184 apart). So the center of the circle might lie on that vertical line?\n\nAlternatively, since points H and G are symmetric across x = e +92, the circle's center must lie on that vertical line. Also, the circle passes through A and D, which are on the y-axis. Let me see.\n\nLet me suppose the center is at (h, k). Since the circle passes through (0,16) and (0,0):\n\nThe distance from center (h,k) to (0,16) equals to distance to (0,0) and to H(e,y) and G(e+184,y).\n\nSo:\n\n(h - 0)^2 + (k -16)^2 = (h -0)^2 + (k -0)^2\n\nSimplify:\n\n(h\u00b2 + (k-16)^2 ) = (h\u00b2 +k\u00b2)\n\nSubtract h\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(k -16)^2 = k\u00b2 \u2192 expanding: k\u00b2 -32k +256 =k\u00b2 \u2192 -32k +256 =0 \u2192 32k =256 \u2192 k=8.\n\nSo the center is at (h,8). The y-coordinate is 8.\n\nAlso, since the center is at (h,8), and it's equidistant to H(e,y) and G(e+184,y). The distance to both H and G must be the same, so:\n\nThe distance from (h,8) to (e,y): sqrt( (h - e)^2 + (8 - y)^2 )\n\nTo (e+184,y): sqrt( (h - (e+184))^2 + (8 - y)^2 )\n\nSet equal:\n\n(h - e)^2 = (h - e -184)^2\n\nExpand right side:\n\n(h - e)^2 - 368(h - e) + 184\u00b2 = (h - e)^2\n\nSubtract (h - e)^2 from both sides:\n\n-368(h - e) + 184\u00b2 =0 \u2192 -368(h -e ) = -184\u00b2 \u2192 h - e = (184\u00b2)/368\n\nCompute 184\u00b2=33856, so 33856 /368. Let's divide numerator and denominator by 16: 33856/16=2116; 368/16=23. So 2116/23. Let's divide 2116 \u00f723. 23*90=2070, 2116-2070=46, 46/23=2. So total 92. So h -e=92 \u2192 h =e +92.\n\nTherefore, the center is at (e +92,8). \n\nNow, since the center is at (e+92,8), the distance to point D(0,0) must equal the radius. Let's compute radius squared:\n\nDistance from center to D: (e+92 -0)^2 + (8 -0)^2 = (e+92)^2 +64.\n\nSimilarly, distance to A(0,16):\n\n(e+92)^2 + (8 -16)^2 = (e+92)^2 + (-8)^2 = (e+92)^2 +64. Wait, that's the same as distance to D? Wait, but that can't be, unless the radius is the same, which it is, since both points are on the circle. So that checks out.\n\nNow, the distance from center to H(e,y):\n\nsqrt( ( (e+92 -e)^2 + (8 - y)^2 )) = sqrt(92\u00b2 + (8 - y)^2 )\n\nThis must equal the radius squared:\n\n(92)^2 + (8 - y)^2 = (e +92)^2 +64.\n\nExpand the right side: (e^2 + 184 e + 92\u00b2) +64.\n\nSo,\n\n92\u00b2 + (8 - y)^2 = e\u00b2 +184e +92\u00b2 +64\n\nSubtract 92\u00b2 from both sides:\n\n(8 - y)^2 = e\u00b2 +184e +64\n\nSo,\n\n(8 - y)^2 = e\u00b2 +184e +64. (Equation A)\n\nSimilarly, since the rectangle EFGH has FG=17, which is the vertical side. Since in the coordinate system, if the rectangle is above the x-axis, then y=17. If below, y=-17.\n\nLet me consider both cases:\n\nCase 1: Rectangle above x-axis, so y=17.\n\nThen (8 -17)^2 = (-9)^2 =81.\n\nSo equation A: 81 = e\u00b2 +184e +64 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184e +64 -81 =0 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184e -17 =0\n\nSolving quadratic equation: e\u00b2 +184e -17=0\n\nDiscriminant D=184\u00b2 +68= (184)^2 +68. Wait, D=184\u00b2 +4*1*17= 184\u00b2 +68. Wait, actually, for equation e\u00b2 +184e -17=0, discriminant D= (184)^2 -4*1*(-17)= 184\u00b2 +68.\n\nCalculate 184\u00b2: 184*184=33,856. So D=33,856 +68=33,924. sqrt(33,924). Let me see: 184^2 is 33,856, so sqrt(33,924)=sqrt(33,856 +68)= approx 184.18? Not an integer. Hmm, so this would lead to irrational e, which is possible but maybe not desired?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rectangle is below, so y=-17.\n\nCase2: Rectangle below x-axis, so y= -17.\n\nThen (8 - (-17))^2 = (25)^2=625.\n\nEquation A: 625 = e\u00b2 +184e +64 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184e +64 -625=0 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184e -561=0\n\nCompute discriminant D=184\u00b2 -4*1*(-561)= 33,856 +2,244=36,100. sqrt(36,100)=190. Because 190\u00b2=36,100. Perfect square!\n\nTherefore, e = [-184 \u00b1190]/2\n\nSo two solutions:\n\ne = (-184 +190)/2 =6/2=3\n\nor e=(-184-190)/2= -374/2= -187\n\nSo e=3 or e=-187.\n\nNow, we need to see which one makes sense in the problem.\n\nFirst, e is the x-coordinate of point E on the x-axis, between D(0,0) and C(107,0) or beyond.\n\nIf e=3, then E is at (3,0), which is between D(0,0) and C(107,0). That's possible.\n\nIf e= -187, then E is at (-187,0), which is to the left of D(0,0). Since the problem says \"rectangles are drawn such that D,E,C,F are collinear\", but it doesn't specify the order. If E is to the left of D, then the order would be E,D,C,F, but then F would be at e +184= -187 +184= -3. So F would be at (-3,0), still left of D. But C is at (107,0). So the points would be E(-187,0), D(0,0), C(107,0), F(-3,0)? Wait, no, F would be at e +184= -187+184= -3, which is between E and D, but C is at 107. So the order would be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). So D,E,C,F are collinear in the order E,F,D,C? But the problem states D,E,C,F are collinear. So the order must include D,E,C,F in that order on the line. So if E is to the left of D, then the order would be E, D, C, F? But F would be at e +184= -187+184= -3, which is between E and D, so actually the order would be E(-187), F(-3), D(0), C(107). So D comes after F. So the given order D,E,C,F would not hold unless the points are arranged with D first, but E is left of D, so that's impossible. Hence e=-187 would mean the order can't have D first. Thus e=-187 is invalid based on the problem's collinearity order D,E,C,F.\n\nTherefore, e=3 is the valid solution.\n\nTherefore, e=3.\n\nThus, point E is at (3,0). The length CE is the distance from C(107,0) to E(3,0), which is 107 -3 =104.\n\nWait, but let me confirm. Since C is at (107,0) and E is at (3,0), so CE is 107-3=104. So is that the answer?\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the coordinates. If e=3, then rectangle EFGH has E(3,0), F(3+184,0)=F(187,0). Wait, but F is supposed to be collinear with D,E,C,F. But C is at (107,0). So the points D(0,0), E(3,0), C(107,0), F(187,0). So they are collinear in order D,E,C,F along the x-axis. Perfect, that fits the problem's condition.\n\nTherefore, CE is the distance from C(107,0) to E(3,0) which is 107 -3 =104. So the answer should be 104.\n\nWait, but let me check with the circle condition to be thorough. Let's confirm that points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(e, y), G(e+184,y) lie on a circle when e=3 and y=-17 (since we considered the rectangle below the x-axis in this case).\n\nSo H is at (3, -17) and G is at (3+184, -17)= (187, -17).\n\nNow, let's verify if these four points lie on a circle.\n\nWe can use the earlier center found: center at (e+92,8) which would be (3+92,8)= (95,8).\n\nRadius squared is (95)^2 +8^2 (distance from center to D(0,0)):\n\n95\u00b2 +8\u00b2= 9025 +64=9089\n\nCheck distance from center (95,8) to A(0,16):\n\nsqrt( (95)^2 + (8-16)^2 )= sqrt(9025 +64)=sqrt(9089), same as radius.\n\nDistance to H(3,-17):\n\nsqrt( (95-3)^2 + (8 - (-17))^2 )= sqrt(92\u00b2 +25\u00b2)= sqrt(8464 +625)= sqrt(9089), same.\n\nDistance to G(187, -17):\n\nsqrt( (187-95)^2 + (8 - (-17))^2 )= sqrt(92\u00b2 +25\u00b2)= same as above. So yes, all points lie on the circle. Perfect.\n\nTherefore, the length CE is 104.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I didn't mix up the cases. Because when I considered the rectangle below the x-axis, we had y=-17, so that's correct. And with e=3, everything works out. So the answer is 104. \n\nBut let me check if there was any miscalculation when solving for e in the second case:\n\nIn case 2 (y=-17):\n\nEquation A: 625 = e\u00b2 +184e +64 \u2192 e\u00b2 +184e -561=0\n\nSolutions:\n\ne = [-184 \u00b1\u221a(184\u00b2 +4*561)]/2\n\nWait, discriminant D=184\u00b2 +4*561. Wait, no, equation is e\u00b2 +184e -561=0, so discriminant is (184)^2 -4*1*(-561)= 184\u00b2 +4*561.\n\nWait, 184\u00b2 is 33,856; 4*561=2,244. So D=33,856 +2,244=36,100. sqrt(36,100)=190. So yes, e=(-184 \u00b1190)/2.\n\nSo yes, e=(6)/2=3 or e=(-374)/2=-187. So that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct value is 3, so CE is 107-3=104. \n\nTherefore, the answer is 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n\n\nGiven rectangles \\(ABCD\\) and \\(EFGH\\) with collinear points \\(D, E, C, F\\) and cyclic quadrilateral \\(ADHG\\), we need to find the length of \\(CE\\). \n\n1. **Coordinates Setup**:\n   - Rectangle \\(ABCD\\) has \\(AB = 107\\) and \\(BC = 16\\).

      "reasoning_text": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. So we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G are on a circle. We need to find the length of CE. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. \n\nFirst, let me sketch the problem mentally. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so FG = EH =17 and EF = GH =184. \n\nNow, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me try to visualize their positions. Since ABCD is a rectangle, points D and C are adjacent vertices. If D, E, C, F are collinear, then the line must pass through D and C, but also include E and F. Hmm, maybe the order is important here. Let me think: If D, E, C, F are collinear in that order, then the line goes from D through E, then through C, and then to F? Wait, but in a rectangle, D and C are adjacent, so the side DC is one of the sides. Wait, actually in rectangle ABCD, the vertices are in order, so ABCD would have AB and CD as the top and bottom sides, BC and AD as the sides. So, if D is one corner, then moving along DC would take you to C. So if D, E, C, F are collinear, maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or maybe the order is different. Hmm, maybe I need to consider coordinates to make this clearer.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the rectangles. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and if D is (0,0), then C would be at (CD, 0). Since CD is equal to AB, which is 107, so CD = 107. Therefore, point C is (107, 0). Then, since AD is 16, which is the height of the rectangle, point A would be at (0, 16), and point B would be at (107,16). \n\nNow, rectangle EFGH. Let me see. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and FG =17, EF=184. Let me see how this rectangle is positioned. The problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear. Since D is (0,0) and C is (107,0), the line they are on is the x-axis. So E and F must also lie on the x-axis. \n\nTherefore, points D(0,0), E, C(107,0), and F are all on the x-axis. Let me figure out the coordinates for E and F. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and F is one of its vertices, so EF is a side of length 184. Since E and F are on the x-axis, and EF is a side of the rectangle, the rectangle EFGH must extend either upwards or downwards from the x-axis. Let's assume for now that it's extending upwards (the direction might not matter, but let's see). \n\nLet me denote the coordinates of E as (x, 0). Since F is next along the x-axis, then F would be at (x + 184, 0), since EF = 184. Wait, but EF is the length of the side, so if moving from E to F along the x-axis, then yes, the distance between E and F is 184. But we need to see where E is placed relative to D and C. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the order must be such that they lie on the same line. Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), E must be either between D and C, or beyond D, or beyond C. Similarly, F could be on either side. \n\nBut given that EFGH is a rectangle, and F is one of its vertices, perhaps F is beyond C? Let me see. Let me consider the order of the points on the x-axis. Suppose the order is D, E, C, F. So starting at D (0,0), then moving to E, then to C (107,0), then to F. Then the distance from E to C would be some value, and from C to F would be another. Alternatively, maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. That might make sense. Let me try that.\n\nLet me assign coordinates step by step. Let me let point E be at some coordinate (e, 0), where e is between 0 and 107, so between D and C. Then, since EF is 184, and F is on the x-axis, then F would be at (e + 184, 0). But since F comes after C (which is at 107,0), then e + 184 must be greater than 107. Therefore, e must be greater than (107 - 184) = -77, which is always true since e is between 0 and 107. Wait, but actually, if E is between D(0,0) and C(107,0), then F would be at (e + 184, 0), which would be way beyond C. Alternatively, if E is before D, then F could be between E and D, but that might complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is different. Let me think again. The problem says \"D, E, C, F are collinear,\" but doesn't specify the order. Maybe the order is D, E, F, C? Wait, but then C would have to be after F. Hmm, but in that case, since C is at 107,0, F would have to be between E and C. But perhaps I need to not fixate on order yet. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the points are arranged as E, D, C, F on the x-axis. Wait, but D is at 0,0, so if E is before D, then E would be at some negative coordinate. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the order is D, C, E, F? Not sure yet. Maybe coordinates can help. Let me proceed with coordinates.\n\nLet me fix coordinate system with D at (0,0), so C is (107,0). Let me let E be at some point (k,0) on the x-axis. Then F, being part of the rectangle EFGH, with EF=184, so the distance from E to F is 184. Since F is also on the x-axis (since D,E,C,F are collinear on x-axis), then F is either (k + 184, 0) or (k - 184,0). \n\nNow, since the problem states that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let me recall that A is (0,16), D is (0,0). So points A(0,16), D(0,0), H, G are on a circle. The rectangle EFGH has vertices E, F, G, H. Let me figure out coordinates for G and H. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and assuming it's in standard position, moving from E to F to G to H. Since E is (k,0), F is (k + 184,0) (assuming F is to the right of E). Then the rectangle EFGH would have sides EF and FG. Since FG is 17, so FG is the vertical side? Wait, FG is a side of the rectangle. Since EF is horizontal (since they're on the x-axis), then FG must be vertical. Since FG =17, so if moving from F upwards (assuming the rectangle is above the x-axis), then G would be at (k + 184, 17), and H would be at (k,17). Alternatively, if the rectangle is below the x-axis, then G would be at (k + 184, -17), H at (k, -17). But since A, D, H, G are on a circle, and A is at (0,16), which is above the x-axis, so perhaps H and G should also be above the x-axis so that they can lie on the same circle as A and D. \n\nTherefore, let me assume the rectangle is above the x-axis. So coordinates:\n\nE: (k,0)\n\nF: (k + 184, 0)\n\nG: (k + 184,17)\n\nH: (k,17)\n\nSo rectangle EFGH has these coordinates. \n\nNow, the points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), G(k + 184,17) lie on a circle. \n\nWe need to find the value of k such that these four points are concyclic. Then, once we have k, we can compute CE. Since C is (107,0), and E is (k,0), then CE is |107 - k|. \n\nSo the key is to find k such that the four points lie on a circle. \n\nTo find if four points lie on a circle, we can use the general equation of a circle or use the property that the perpendicular bisectors of the chords intersect at the center. Alternatively, we can plug the coordinates into the circle equation and solve for k. \n\nLet me set up the circle equation. Let the general equation of a circle be x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by + c =0. Since points A, D, H, G lie on this circle, substituting their coordinates into the equation should satisfy it.\n\nLet me substitute each point:\n\n1. Point D(0,0):\n\n0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + a*0 + b*0 + c = 0 \u21d2 c = 0.\n\nSo the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x + b y =0.\n\n2. Point A(0,16):\n\n0\u00b2 + (16)^2 + a*0 + b*16 =0 \u21d2 256 + 16b =0 \u21d2 16b = -256 \u21d2 b = -16.\n\nSo now equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x -16 y =0.\n\n3. Point H(k,17):\n\nk\u00b2 + (17)^2 + a*k -16*17 =0 \u21d2 k\u00b2 + 289 + a k - 272 =0 \u21d2 k\u00b2 + a k + 17 =0. (Equation 1)\n\n4. Point G(k + 184,17):\n\n(k + 184)^2 + (17)^2 + a*(k + 184) -16*17 =0.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n(k\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2) + 289 + a k + 184a - 272 =0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst, expand (k + 184)^2: k\u00b2 + 2*184*k + 184\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 368k + (184)^2.\n\nThen adding 17\u00b2 (289):\n\nSo total terms:\n\nk\u00b2 + 368k + (184)^2 + 289 + a k + 184a - 272.\n\nWait, the last term is -16*17 = -272. So yes.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\nThe k\u00b2 term: k\u00b2\n\nThe k terms: 368k + a k\n\nThe constants: (184)^2 + 289 - 272 + 184a\n\nWait, let's compute each part step by step:\n\nFirst, the expansion of (k + 184)^2 +17^2 is:\n\n(k\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2) + 289\n\nThen adding a*(k + 184):\n\n+ a k + 184 a\n\nThen subtract 16*17 (which is 272):\n\n- 272.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nk\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2 + 289 + a k + 184 a - 272 =0\n\nNow, let's combine the constants:\n\n184\u00b2 is 184 squared. Let me compute that:\n\n184*184. Let me compute 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 + 4\u00b2 = 32400 + 1440 + 16 = 32400 + 1440 is 33840, plus 16 is 33856. Wait, but actually, 184 squared:\n\n184 * 184:\n\n184 * 100 = 18400,\n\n184 * 80 = 14720,\n\n184 *4 = 736,\n\nAdding those: 18400 +14720=33120 +736=33856. Yes, so 184\u00b2 = 33856.\n\nThen 33856 + 289 = 34145, then minus 272 gives 34145 - 272 = 33873.\n\nSo the constant terms add up to 33873 + 184a?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 184a is part of the terms. So actually, the constants are 33856 +289 -272 = 33856 + (289 -272)= 33856 +17= 33873. Then, the term with a is 184a. So total constants: 33873 + 184a.\n\nThe k terms: 368k + a k =k*(368 + a)\n\nSo the entire equation becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 + (368 + a)k + (33873 + 184a) =0. (Equation 2)\n\nNow, from equation 1 (from point H):\n\nk\u00b2 + a k +17 =0. (Equation 1)\n\nWe can use Equation 1 to substitute into Equation 2.\n\nFrom Equation 1: k\u00b2 = -a k -17.\n\nSubstitute k\u00b2 into Equation 2:\n\n(-a k -17) + (368 + a)k + (33873 + 184a) =0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: -a k -17\n\nSecond term: (368 + a)k\n\nThird term: 33873 + 184a\n\nCombine the k terms:\n\n(-a k) + (368 + a)k = (-a + 368 + a)k = 368k\n\nConstant terms: -17 + 33873 + 184a\n\nSo overall:\n\n368k + (-17 + 33873 + 184a) =0\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n-17 + 33873 = 33856\n\nSo:\n\n368k + 33856 + 184a =0\n\nDivide all terms by common factor if possible. Let me see, 368 is 184*2, and 184 is a common factor in some terms.\n\nLet me factor out 184:\n\n184*(2k) + 184a + 33856 =0 ?\n\nWait, 368k = 184*2k, 184a is 184a, so:\n\n184*(2k + a) + 33856 =0\n\nHmm, so:\n\n184*(2k + a) = -33856\n\nDivide both sides by 184:\n\n2k + a = -33856 /184\n\nLet me compute that division:\n\n33856 \u00f7 184. Let me see:\n\n184 \u00d7 184 = 33856? Wait, 184*180 = 33120, 184*4=736, so 184*184=33120+736=33856. Oh! So 184 \u00d7184 = 33856. Therefore, 33856 /184 =184. So,\n\n2k +a = -184\n\nTherefore, 2k + a = -184. (Equation 3)\n\nNow, from Equation 1: k\u00b2 + a k +17=0. Let's solve for a from Equation 3:\n\nFrom Equation 3: a = -184 -2k.\n\nPlugging into Equation 1:\n\nk\u00b2 + (-184 -2k)*k +17 =0\n\nExpand:\n\nk\u00b2 -184k -2k\u00b2 +17 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nk\u00b2 -2k\u00b2 = -k\u00b2\n\n-184k remains\n\n+17 remains\n\nSo:\n\n- k\u00b2 -184k +17=0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nk\u00b2 +184k -17=0\n\nSo now, quadratic equation: k\u00b2 +184k -17 =0\n\nHmm, solving for k:\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\nk = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 4*1*17) ] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n184\u00b2 + 68. Since 184\u00b2 is 33856, so discriminant is 33856 +68 = 33924.\n\nNow sqrt(33924). Let me see if this is a perfect square. Let me try 184.2 squared? Wait, 184 squared is 33856, so sqrt(33924) is sqrt(33856 +68)= sqrt(184\u00b2 +68). Hmm, not obvious. Wait, maybe 184.2?\n\nWait, let me check 184.1 squared: (184 +0.1)^2 = 184\u00b2 + 2*184*0.1 +0.01= 33856 +36.8 +0.01=33892.81, which is still less than 33924. 184.5 squared would be (184 +0.5)^2= 184\u00b2 +2*184*0.5 +0.25= 33856 +184 +0.25=34040.25 which is way over. Hmm, maybe it's not a perfect square. Wait, perhaps miscalculation?\n\nWait let me check discriminant again. The quadratic equation was k\u00b2 +184k -17 =0. So discriminant is (184)^2 -4*1*(-17)= 33856 +68= 33924. Wait, no, wait, discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b=184, c=-17. So discriminant is (184)^2 -4(1)(-17)= 33856 +68=33924. So sqrt(33924). Let me see 184^2 is 33856, so 184^2 +68 =33924. Hmm, so sqrt(33924)=sqrt(184\u00b2 +68). Maybe that's not a perfect square, but perhaps I made an error in calculation earlier?\n\nWait, let me check again the equations step by step because this seems a bit messy and perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nStarting again, from the circle equation:\n\nWe had points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), G(k+184,17). The equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x + b y =0 (since c=0 and b=-16 as found earlier).\n\nWait, hold on, in the first substitution for point A(0,16):\n\nWe had 0 + 256 +0 +16b =0 \u21d216b = -256 \u21d2b= -16. So the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x -16 y =0. \n\nThen for point H(k,17):\n\nk\u00b2 + (17)^2 + a k -16*(17)=0 \u21d2k\u00b2 + 289 +a k -272 =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 +a k +17=0. Correct.\n\nFor point G(k+184,17):\n\n(k+184)^2 + 17\u00b2 + a(k+184) -16*17 =0.\n\nYes, expanding (k +184)^2 gives k\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2, plus 289 (from 17\u00b2) plus a(k+184) which is a k +184 a, then minus 272 (from 16*17). \n\nSo combining terms:\n\nk\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2 +289 + a k +184a -272 =0\n\nThen, 184\u00b2 is 33856, so 33856 +289 is 34145, minus 272 gives 33873. Then, the equation is:\n\nk\u00b2 + (368 +a)k + (33873 +184a) =0. Correct.\n\nThen substituting from equation1 (k\u00b2 = -a k -17):\n\nReplace k\u00b2 in equation2:\n\n(-a k -17) + (368 +a)k + (33873 +184a) =0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(-a k +368k +a k) + (-17 +33873 +184a)=0 \u21d2368k + (33856 +184a)=0\n\nWait, 33873 -17 is 33856? Let me confirm:\n\n33873 -17 is 33856. Yes, because 33873-10=33863, minus7 more is 33856.\n\nSo 368k + 33856 +184a =0\n\nThen factoring 184:\n\n184*(2k) +184a +33856=0 \u2192 184*(2k +a) +33856=0. \n\nWait, but 368k is 184*2k, so 184*(2k) + 184a =184*(2k +a). Then adding 33856, which is 184^2. Wait, since 184^2 is 33856, so the equation becomes:\n\n184*(2k + a) + (184)^2 =0 \u21d2 184*(2k +a +184)=0 ?\n\nWait, 184*(2k +a) + 184*184 =0 \u21d2 184*(2k +a +184)=0? Wait, no. Wait, 184*(2k +a) +184\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 184*(2k +a +184) ?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me see:\n\nWait, 184*(2k +a) + 184\u00b2 = 0 \u21d2 184*(2k +a +184) ?\n\nWait, no, that would be if it were 184*(2k +a) + 184*184 = 184*(2k +a +184). Wait, actually, yes, factoring out 184:\n\n184*( (2k +a) +184 ) =0 \u21d2 184*(2k +a +184)=0. Since 184 \u22600, so 2k +a +184 =0 \u21d2 2k +a = -184. Which matches the previous result. So that's correct.\n\nThen from equation 3: 2k +a =-184 \u21d2 a =-184 -2k. \n\nSubstituting back into equation1 (k\u00b2 +a k +17=0):\n\nk\u00b2 + (-184 -2k)k +17 =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 -184k -2k\u00b2 +17=0 \u21d2-k\u00b2 -184k +17=0 \u21d2k\u00b2 +184k -17=0. Correct.\n\nSo quadratic equation k\u00b2 +184k -17=0. \n\nHmm, solving this quadratic:\n\nk = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)]/2.\n\nWait, discriminant D = (184)^2 +4*1*17=33856 +68=33924.\n\nWait, sqrt(33924). Let me check sqrt(33924). Let me see:\n\n184^2 is 33856, so sqrt(33856)=184. Then sqrt(33924) is sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68). Hmm, perhaps 184.0...?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me see again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rectangle is placed downward, so H and G are below the x-axis. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose rectangle EFGH is below the x-axis. Then coordinates would be:\n\nE(k,0), F(k+184,0), G(k+184, -17), H(k, -17). Then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k, -17), G(k+184, -17) lie on a circle.\n\nLet me see if this would give a better equation.\n\nLet me try this approach again with H and G below.\n\nSo points on the circle:\n\nA(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,-17), G(k+184, -17).\n\nProceeding similarly:\n\nCircle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +ax + by +c =0.\n\nPlug D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 \u21d2 c=0.\n\nPlug A(0,16): 0 + 256 +0 +16b =0 \u21d216b = -256 \u21d2b= -16.\n\nEquation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +a x -16 y =0.\n\nPlug H(k, -17):\n\nk\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + a k -16*(-17) =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 +289 +a k +272 =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 + a k +561 =0 (Equation 1).\n\nPlug G(k+184, -17):\n\n(k+184)^2 + (-17)^2 +a(k+184) -16*(-17) =0.\n\nExpand:\n\n(k\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2) + 289 + a k + 184a + 272 =0.\n\nCompute constants:\n\n184\u00b2 =33856,\n\n33856 +289 =34145,\n\n34145 +272= 34417,\n\nThus,\n\nk\u00b2 +368k +33856 +289 +a k +184a +272 =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 + (368 +a)k + (33856 +289 +272) +184a =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 + (368 +a)k + (34417) +184a =0. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, expanding step by step:\n\n(k +184)^2 is k\u00b2 +368k +184\u00b2,\n\nplus (-17)^2 is 289,\n\nplus a(k +184)=a k +184a,\n\nminus 16*(-17) is +272.\n\nSo total terms:\n\nk\u00b2 +368k +184\u00b2 +289 +a k +184a +272 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nk\u00b2 + (368k +a k) + (184\u00b2 +289 +272) +184a =0.\n\n184\u00b2 is 33856,\n\n289 +272 =561,\n\nso constants: 33856 +561 = 34417,\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 + (368 +a)k + 34417 +184a =0 (Equation 2)\n\nAgain, from Equation1 (H's equation):\n\nk\u00b2 +a k +561 =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 = -a k -561.\n\nSubstitute into Equation2:\n\n(-a k -561) + (368 +a)k + 34417 +184a =0\n\nExpand:\n\n- a k -561 +368k +a k +34417 +184a =0\n\nThe -a k and +a k cancel,\n\nSo:\n\n368k -561 +34417 +184a =0\n\nCombine constants:\n\n-561 +34417 = 33856,\n\nSo,\n\n368k +33856 +184a =0\n\nSame as before! So 368k + 184a = -33856,\n\nFactor 184:\n\n184*(2k +a) = -33856,\n\nThus,\n\n2k +a = -33856/184 = -184,\n\nSame as previous case. So a = -184 -2k.\n\nPlugging back into Equation1 (for this case):\n\nk\u00b2 +a k +561 =0,\n\nSubstitute a:\n\nk\u00b2 + (-184 -2k)k +561 =0,\n\nExpand:\n\nk\u00b2 -184k -2k\u00b2 +561 =0,\n\nCombine terms:\n\n- k\u00b2 -184k +561=0 \u21d2k\u00b2 +184k -561=0.\n\nHmm, different quadratic equation now: k\u00b2 +184k -561=0.\n\nWait, so depending on whether the rectangle is above or below, we get different quadratics. Since the problem didn't specify the direction, but the four points must lie on a circle. Let me check which of these quadratics has real solutions.\n\nFirst case (rectangle above):\n\nEquation: k\u00b2 +184k -17=0,\n\nDiscriminant D= (184)^2 +68=33856 +68=33924,\n\nsqrt(33924)=?\n\nLet me compute 184.2^2: 184^2=33856, 0.2^2=0.04, 2*184*0.2=73.6,\n\nso (184 +0.2)^2=33856 +73.6 +0.04=33929.64, which is more than 33924.\n\nHmm, so sqrt(33924) is between 184 and 184.2. Since it's not a whole number, perhaps the problem requires an integer? Wait, but CE is |107 -k|, so if k is not an integer, CE might not be. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming the direction.\n\nAlternatively, in the second case (rectangle below):\n\nEquation: k\u00b2 +184k -561=0,\n\nDiscriminant D= (184)^2 +4*561=33856 +2244= 36100,\n\nsqrt(36100)=190, which is a whole number!\n\nAh! So that's better. So in this case, sqrt(36100)=190,\n\nThus, k = [ -184 \u00b1190 ]/2\n\nSo two solutions:\n\nk = (-184 +190)/2 =6/2=3,\n\nor k=(-184 -190)/2=(-374)/2=-187.\n\nNow, we need to consider the positions. \n\nFirst, if k=3, then E is at (3,0). Since C is at (107,0), so CE would be 107-3=104.\n\nAlternatively, if k= -187, then E is at (-187,0). Then CE would be 107 - (-187)= 107 +187=294. But let's see if this makes sense.\n\nLet me check the rectangle positions.\n\nCase 1: k=3 (E is at (3,0)):\n\nThen rectangle EFGH is below the x-axis (since we considered the downward case). So F is at (3+184,0)= (187,0). Wait, but C is at (107,0). So the order on the x-axis would be D(0,0), E(3,0), C(107,0), F(187,0). So D,E,C,F are collinear in that order. That seems okay. The rectangle EFGH would extend downward from E(3,0) to F(187,0), then to G(187,-17), H(3,-17). Then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), G(187,-17) lie on a circle. That seems possible.\n\nCase 2: k=-187 (E is at (-187,0)):\n\nThen F is at (-187 +184,0)= (-3,0). So on the x-axis, the order would be E(-187,0), D(0,0), C(107,0), F(-3,0). Wait, but F at (-3,0) is between D(0,0) and C(107,0)? No, since -3 is between -187 and 0, but not between D and C. Wait, actually the points would be ordered E(-187,0), D(0,0), F(-3,0), C(107,0). Wait, but F is at -3, so between D(0) and C(107)? No, -3 is left of D. So the collinear points would be E(-187), D(0), F(-3), C(107). That's not in order unless arranged differently. The problem states D,E,C,F are collinear but doesn't specify order. However, F would be between E and D in this case, but then C is after D. So the order could be E, D, F, C? But the problem says \"D,E,C,F are collinear\"\u2014maybe they are in the order D, E, C, F, but that would require E between D and C, and F after C, which is the first case. So perhaps the second case with k=-187 is not valid because F would not be after C. \n\nTherefore, k=3 is the valid solution. Thus, CE =107 -3=104.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the circle. Let me check if the four points lie on a circle when k=3.\n\nCompute coordinates:\n\nA(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), G(187,-17).\n\nWe can check if these lie on the same circle.\n\nFirst, let's find the circle equation. Let me use three points to find the equation and check the fourth.\n\nLet me use points A, D, H.\n\nPoints D(0,0), A(0,16), H(3,-17).\n\nLet me use general circle equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +ax +by +c =0.\n\nPlug D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 \u21d2c=0.\n\nPlug A(0,16): 0 +256 +0 +16b +0=0 \u21d216b = -256 \u21d2b= -16.\n\nPlug H(3,-17): 9 +289 +3a + (-17)(-16)=0 \u21d29 +289 +3a +272=0 \u21d2(9+289+272) +3a=0 \u21d2570 +3a=0 \u21d23a= -570 \u21d2a= -190.\n\nThus equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -190x -16y =0.\n\nNow check if G(187,-17) lies on this circle:\n\n187\u00b2 + (-17)^2 -190*187 -16*(-17).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n187\u00b2: 187*187. Let me compute 180\u00b2 + 2*180*7 +7\u00b2 = 32400 + 2520 +49= 32400+2520=34920 +49=34969.\n\n17\u00b2=289.\n\nSo 187\u00b2 + (-17)^2 =34969 +289=35258.\n\nNow, -190*187: Let's compute 190*187. 200*187=37400, minus 10*187=1870 \u21d237400-1870=35530. So -190*187= -35530.\n\n-16*(-17)=+272.\n\nThus total: 35258 -35530 +272 = (35258 +272) -35530 =35530 -35530=0. Perfect, so G is on the circle. Thus k=3 is valid.\n\nTherefore, CE is 107 -3=104.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the first case where the rectangle is above the x-axis, the quadratic had discriminant sqrt(33924) which isn't a whole number, leading to non-integer k, which would make CE a non-integer, but the problem probably expects an integer. So the correct scenario is the rectangle below the x-axis with k=3, leading to CE=104.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 104.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more to be sure.\n\nYes, the problem didn't specify the direction of the rectangle, but the key was that the four points lie on a circle. Since in the downward case, we got an integer solution, which makes CE an integer, which is likely the answer expected here. So I think the answer is 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n",

      "full_content": "Okay, let me try to tackle this problem step by step. So we have two rectangles, ABCD and EFGH. The points D, E, C, F are collinear, which means they all lie on a straight line. Also, points A, D, H, G are on a circle. We need to find the length of CE. The given lengths are BC = 16, AB = 107, FG = 17, and EF = 184. \n\nFirst, let me sketch the problem mentally. Since ABCD is a rectangle, opposite sides are equal. So AB = CD = 107, and BC = AD = 16. Similarly, EFGH is a rectangle, so FG = EH =17 and EF = GH =184. \n\nNow, the points D, E, C, F are collinear. Let me try to visualize their positions. Since ABCD is a rectangle, points D and C are adjacent vertices. If D, E, C, F are collinear, then the line must pass through D and C, but also include E and F. Hmm, maybe the order is important here. Let me think: If D, E, C, F are collinear in that order, then the line goes from D through E, then through C, and then to F? Wait, but in a rectangle, D and C are adjacent, so the side DC is one of the sides. Wait, actually in rectangle ABCD, the vertices are in order, so ABCD would have AB and CD as the top and bottom sides, BC and AD as the sides. So, if D is one corner, then moving along DC would take you to C. So if D, E, C, F are collinear, maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C? Or maybe the order is different. Hmm, maybe I need to consider coordinates to make this clearer.\n\nLet me assign coordinates to the rectangles. Let's place point D at the origin (0,0). Since ABCD is a rectangle, and if D is (0,0), then C would be at (CD, 0). Since CD is equal to AB, which is 107, so CD = 107. Therefore, point C is (107, 0). Then, since AD is 16, which is the height of the rectangle, point A would be at (0, 16), and point B would be at (107,16). \n\nNow, rectangle EFGH. Let me see. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and FG =17, EF=184. Let me see how this rectangle is positioned. The problem states that D, E, C, F are collinear. Since D is (0,0) and C is (107,0), the line they are on is the x-axis. So E and F must also lie on the x-axis. \n\nTherefore, points D(0,0), E, C(107,0), and F are all on the x-axis. Let me figure out the coordinates for E and F. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and F is one of its vertices, so EF is a side of length 184. Since E and F are on the x-axis, and EF is a side of the rectangle, the rectangle EFGH must extend either upwards or downwards from the x-axis. Let's assume for now that it's extending upwards (the direction might not matter, but let's see). \n\nLet me denote the coordinates of E as (x, 0). Since F is next along the x-axis, then F would be at (x + 184, 0), since EF = 184. Wait, but EF is the length of the side, so if moving from E to F along the x-axis, then yes, the distance between E and F is 184. But we need to see where E is placed relative to D and C. Since D, E, C, F are collinear, the order must be such that they lie on the same line. Since D is at (0,0) and C is at (107,0), E must be either between D and C, or beyond D, or beyond C. Similarly, F could be on either side. \n\nBut given that EFGH is a rectangle, and F is one of its vertices, perhaps F is beyond C? Let me see. Let me consider the order of the points on the x-axis. Suppose the order is D, E, C, F. So starting at D (0,0), then moving to E, then to C (107,0), then to F. Then the distance from E to C would be some value, and from C to F would be another. Alternatively, maybe E is between D and C, and F is beyond C. That might make sense. Let me try that.\n\nLet me assign coordinates step by step. Let me let point E be at some coordinate (e, 0), where e is between 0 and 107, so between D and C. Then, since EF is 184, and F is on the x-axis, then F would be at (e + 184, 0). But since F comes after C (which is at 107,0), then e + 184 must be greater than 107. Therefore, e must be greater than (107 - 184) = -77, which is always true since e is between 0 and 107. Wait, but actually, if E is between D(0,0) and C(107,0), then F would be at (e + 184, 0), which would be way beyond C. Alternatively, if E is before D, then F could be between E and D, but that might complicate things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the order is different. Let me think again. The problem says \"D, E, C, F are collinear,\" but doesn't specify the order. Maybe the order is D, E, F, C? Wait, but then C would have to be after F. Hmm, but in that case, since C is at 107,0, F would have to be between E and C. But perhaps I need to not fixate on order yet. Let me see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the points are arranged as E, D, C, F on the x-axis. Wait, but D is at 0,0, so if E is before D, then E would be at some negative coordinate. Let me see. Alternatively, perhaps the order is D, C, E, F? Not sure yet. Maybe coordinates can help. Let me proceed with coordinates.\n\nLet me fix coordinate system with D at (0,0), so C is (107,0). Let me let E be at some point (k,0) on the x-axis. Then F, being part of the rectangle EFGH, with EF=184, so the distance from E to F is 184. Since F is also on the x-axis (since D,E,C,F are collinear on x-axis), then F is either (k + 184, 0) or (k - 184,0). \n\nNow, since the problem states that A, D, H, G lie on a circle. Let me recall that A is (0,16), D is (0,0). So points A(0,16), D(0,0), H, G are on a circle. The rectangle EFGH has vertices E, F, G, H. Let me figure out coordinates for G and H. Since EFGH is a rectangle, and assuming it's in standard position, moving from E to F to G to H. Since E is (k,0), F is (k + 184,0) (assuming F is to the right of E). Then the rectangle EFGH would have sides EF and FG. Since FG is 17, so FG is the vertical side? Wait, FG is a side of the rectangle. Since EF is horizontal (since they're on the x-axis), then FG must be vertical. Since FG =17, so if moving from F upwards (assuming the rectangle is above the x-axis), then G would be at (k + 184, 17), and H would be at (k,17). Alternatively, if the rectangle is below the x-axis, then G would be at (k + 184, -17), H at (k, -17). But since A, D, H, G are on a circle, and A is at (0,16), which is above the x-axis, so perhaps H and G should also be above the x-axis so that they can lie on the same circle as A and D. \n\nTherefore, let me assume the rectangle is above the x-axis. So coordinates:\n\nE: (k,0)\n\nF: (k + 184, 0)\n\nG: (k + 184,17)\n\nH: (k,17)\n\nSo rectangle EFGH has these coordinates. \n\nNow, the points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), G(k + 184,17) lie on a circle. \n\nWe need to find the value of k such that these four points are concyclic. Then, once we have k, we can compute CE. Since C is (107,0), and E is (k,0), then CE is |107 - k|. \n\nSo the key is to find k such that the four points lie on a circle. \n\nTo find if four points lie on a circle, we can use the general equation of a circle or use the property that the perpendicular bisectors of the chords intersect at the center. Alternatively, we can plug the coordinates into the circle equation and solve for k. \n\nLet me set up the circle equation. Let the general equation of a circle be x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + ax + by + c =0. Since points A, D, H, G lie on this circle, substituting their coordinates into the equation should satisfy it.\n\nLet me substitute each point:\n\n1. Point D(0,0):\n\n0\u00b2 + 0\u00b2 + a*0 + b*0 + c = 0 \u21d2 c = 0.\n\nSo the equation simplifies to x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x + b y =0.\n\n2. Point A(0,16):\n\n0\u00b2 + (16)^2 + a*0 + b*16 =0 \u21d2 256 + 16b =0 \u21d2 16b = -256 \u21d2 b = -16.\n\nSo now equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x -16 y =0.\n\n3. Point H(k,17):\n\nk\u00b2 + (17)^2 + a*k -16*17 =0 \u21d2 k\u00b2 + 289 + a k - 272 =0 \u21d2 k\u00b2 + a k + 17 =0. (Equation 1)\n\n4. Point G(k + 184,17):\n\n(k + 184)^2 + (17)^2 + a*(k + 184) -16*17 =0.\n\nLet me expand this:\n\n(k\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2) + 289 + a k + 184a - 272 =0.\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst, expand (k + 184)^2: k\u00b2 + 2*184*k + 184\u00b2 = k\u00b2 + 368k + (184)^2.\n\nThen adding 17\u00b2 (289):\n\nSo total terms:\n\nk\u00b2 + 368k + (184)^2 + 289 + a k + 184a - 272.\n\nWait, the last term is -16*17 = -272. So yes.\n\nNow, let's combine like terms:\n\nThe k\u00b2 term: k\u00b2\n\nThe k terms: 368k + a k\n\nThe constants: (184)^2 + 289 - 272 + 184a\n\nWait, let's compute each part step by step:\n\nFirst, the expansion of (k + 184)^2 +17^2 is:\n\n(k\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2) + 289\n\nThen adding a*(k + 184):\n\n+ a k + 184 a\n\nThen subtract 16*17 (which is 272):\n\n- 272.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nk\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2 + 289 + a k + 184 a - 272 =0\n\nNow, let's combine the constants:\n\n184\u00b2 is 184 squared. Let me compute that:\n\n184*184. Let me compute 180\u00b2 + 2*180*4 + 4\u00b2 = 32400 + 1440 + 16 = 32400 + 1440 is 33840, plus 16 is 33856. Wait, but actually, 184 squared:\n\n184 * 184:\n\n184 * 100 = 18400,\n\n184 * 80 = 14720,\n\n184 *4 = 736,\n\nAdding those: 18400 +14720=33120 +736=33856. Yes, so 184\u00b2 = 33856.\n\nThen 33856 + 289 = 34145, then minus 272 gives 34145 - 272 = 33873.\n\nSo the constant terms add up to 33873 + 184a?\n\nWait, no. Wait, 184a is part of the terms. So actually, the constants are 33856 +289 -272 = 33856 + (289 -272)= 33856 +17= 33873. Then, the term with a is 184a. So total constants: 33873 + 184a.\n\nThe k terms: 368k + a k =k*(368 + a)\n\nSo the entire equation becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 + (368 + a)k + (33873 + 184a) =0. (Equation 2)\n\nNow, from equation 1 (from point H):\n\nk\u00b2 + a k +17 =0. (Equation 1)\n\nWe can use Equation 1 to substitute into Equation 2.\n\nFrom Equation 1: k\u00b2 = -a k -17.\n\nSubstitute k\u00b2 into Equation 2:\n\n(-a k -17) + (368 + a)k + (33873 + 184a) =0\n\nSimplify term by term:\n\nFirst term: -a k -17\n\nSecond term: (368 + a)k\n\nThird term: 33873 + 184a\n\nCombine the k terms:\n\n(-a k) + (368 + a)k = (-a + 368 + a)k = 368k\n\nConstant terms: -17 + 33873 + 184a\n\nSo overall:\n\n368k + (-17 + 33873 + 184a) =0\n\nSimplify constants:\n\n-17 + 33873 = 33856\n\nSo:\n\n368k + 33856 + 184a =0\n\nDivide all terms by common factor if possible. Let me see, 368 is 184*2, and 184 is a common factor in some terms.\n\nLet me factor out 184:\n\n184*(2k) + 184a + 33856 =0 ?\n\nWait, 368k = 184*2k, 184a is 184a, so:\n\n184*(2k + a) + 33856 =0\n\nHmm, so:\n\n184*(2k + a) = -33856\n\nDivide both sides by 184:\n\n2k + a = -33856 /184\n\nLet me compute that division:\n\n33856 \u00f7 184. Let me see:\n\n184 \u00d7 184 = 33856? Wait, 184*180 = 33120, 184*4=736, so 184*184=33120+736=33856. Oh! So 184 \u00d7184 = 33856. Therefore, 33856 /184 =184. So,\n\n2k +a = -184\n\nTherefore, 2k + a = -184. (Equation 3)\n\nNow, from Equation 1: k\u00b2 + a k +17=0. Let's solve for a from Equation 3:\n\nFrom Equation 3: a = -184 -2k.\n\nPlugging into Equation 1:\n\nk\u00b2 + (-184 -2k)*k +17 =0\n\nExpand:\n\nk\u00b2 -184k -2k\u00b2 +17 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nk\u00b2 -2k\u00b2 = -k\u00b2\n\n-184k remains\n\n+17 remains\n\nSo:\n\n- k\u00b2 -184k +17=0\n\nMultiply both sides by -1:\n\nk\u00b2 +184k -17=0\n\nSo now, quadratic equation: k\u00b2 +184k -17 =0\n\nHmm, solving for k:\n\nUse quadratic formula:\n\nk = [ -184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 4*1*17) ] / 2\n\nCompute discriminant:\n\n184\u00b2 + 68. Since 184\u00b2 is 33856, so discriminant is 33856 +68 = 33924.\n\nNow sqrt(33924). Let me see if this is a perfect square. Let me try 184.2 squared? Wait, 184 squared is 33856, so sqrt(33924) is sqrt(33856 +68)= sqrt(184\u00b2 +68). Hmm, not obvious. Wait, maybe 184.2?\n\nWait, let me check 184.1 squared: (184 +0.1)^2 = 184\u00b2 + 2*184*0.1 +0.01= 33856 +36.8 +0.01=33892.81, which is still less than 33924. 184.5 squared would be (184 +0.5)^2= 184\u00b2 +2*184*0.5 +0.25= 33856 +184 +0.25=34040.25 which is way over. Hmm, maybe it's not a perfect square. Wait, perhaps miscalculation?\n\nWait let me check discriminant again. The quadratic equation was k\u00b2 +184k -17 =0. So discriminant is (184)^2 -4*1*(-17)= 33856 +68= 33924. Wait, no, wait, discriminant is b\u00b2 -4ac. Here, a=1, b=184, c=-17. So discriminant is (184)^2 -4(1)(-17)= 33856 +68=33924. So sqrt(33924). Let me see 184^2 is 33856, so 184^2 +68 =33924. Hmm, so sqrt(33924)=sqrt(184\u00b2 +68). Maybe that's not a perfect square, but perhaps I made an error in calculation earlier?\n\nWait, let me check again the equations step by step because this seems a bit messy and perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nStarting again, from the circle equation:\n\nWe had points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,17), G(k+184,17). The equation of the circle is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x + b y =0 (since c=0 and b=-16 as found earlier).\n\nWait, hold on, in the first substitution for point A(0,16):\n\nWe had 0 + 256 +0 +16b =0 \u21d216b = -256 \u21d2b= -16. So the equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 + a x -16 y =0. \n\nThen for point H(k,17):\n\nk\u00b2 + (17)^2 + a k -16*(17)=0 \u21d2k\u00b2 + 289 +a k -272 =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 +a k +17=0. Correct.\n\nFor point G(k+184,17):\n\n(k+184)^2 + 17\u00b2 + a(k+184) -16*17 =0.\n\nYes, expanding (k +184)^2 gives k\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2, plus 289 (from 17\u00b2) plus a(k+184) which is a k +184 a, then minus 272 (from 16*17). \n\nSo combining terms:\n\nk\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2 +289 + a k +184a -272 =0\n\nThen, 184\u00b2 is 33856, so 33856 +289 is 34145, minus 272 gives 33873. Then, the equation is:\n\nk\u00b2 + (368 +a)k + (33873 +184a) =0. Correct.\n\nThen substituting from equation1 (k\u00b2 = -a k -17):\n\nReplace k\u00b2 in equation2:\n\n(-a k -17) + (368 +a)k + (33873 +184a) =0\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n(-a k +368k +a k) + (-17 +33873 +184a)=0 \u21d2368k + (33856 +184a)=0\n\nWait, 33873 -17 is 33856? Let me confirm:\n\n33873 -17 is 33856. Yes, because 33873-10=33863, minus7 more is 33856.\n\nSo 368k + 33856 +184a =0\n\nThen factoring 184:\n\n184*(2k) +184a +33856=0 \u2192 184*(2k +a) +33856=0. \n\nWait, but 368k is 184*2k, so 184*(2k) + 184a =184*(2k +a). Then adding 33856, which is 184^2. Wait, since 184^2 is 33856, so the equation becomes:\n\n184*(2k + a) + (184)^2 =0 \u21d2 184*(2k +a +184)=0 ?\n\nWait, 184*(2k +a) + 184*184 =0 \u21d2 184*(2k +a +184)=0? Wait, no. Wait, 184*(2k +a) +184\u00b2 =0 \u21d2 184*(2k +a +184) ?\n\nWait, no, that's not correct. Let me see:\n\nWait, 184*(2k +a) + 184\u00b2 = 0 \u21d2 184*(2k +a +184) ?\n\nWait, no, that would be if it were 184*(2k +a) + 184*184 = 184*(2k +a +184). Wait, actually, yes, factoring out 184:\n\n184*( (2k +a) +184 ) =0 \u21d2 184*(2k +a +184)=0. Since 184 \u22600, so 2k +a +184 =0 \u21d2 2k +a = -184. Which matches the previous result. So that's correct.\n\nThen from equation 3: 2k +a =-184 \u21d2 a =-184 -2k. \n\nSubstituting back into equation1 (k\u00b2 +a k +17=0):\n\nk\u00b2 + (-184 -2k)k +17 =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 -184k -2k\u00b2 +17=0 \u21d2-k\u00b2 -184k +17=0 \u21d2k\u00b2 +184k -17=0. Correct.\n\nSo quadratic equation k\u00b2 +184k -17=0. \n\nHmm, solving this quadratic:\n\nk = [-184 \u00b1 sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68)]/2.\n\nWait, discriminant D = (184)^2 +4*1*17=33856 +68=33924.\n\nWait, sqrt(33924). Let me check sqrt(33924). Let me see:\n\n184^2 is 33856, so sqrt(33856)=184. Then sqrt(33924) is sqrt(33856 +68)=sqrt(184\u00b2 + 68). Hmm, perhaps 184.0...?\n\nAlternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the problem setup. Let me see again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the rectangle is placed downward, so H and G are below the x-axis. Let me try that.\n\nSuppose rectangle EFGH is below the x-axis. Then coordinates would be:\n\nE(k,0), F(k+184,0), G(k+184, -17), H(k, -17). Then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(k, -17), G(k+184, -17) lie on a circle.\n\nLet me see if this would give a better equation.\n\nLet me try this approach again with H and G below.\n\nSo points on the circle:\n\nA(0,16), D(0,0), H(k,-17), G(k+184, -17).\n\nProceeding similarly:\n\nCircle equation x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +ax + by +c =0.\n\nPlug D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 \u21d2 c=0.\n\nPlug A(0,16): 0 + 256 +0 +16b =0 \u21d216b = -256 \u21d2b= -16.\n\nEquation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +a x -16 y =0.\n\nPlug H(k, -17):\n\nk\u00b2 + (-17)^2 + a k -16*(-17) =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 +289 +a k +272 =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 + a k +561 =0 (Equation 1).\n\nPlug G(k+184, -17):\n\n(k+184)^2 + (-17)^2 +a(k+184) -16*(-17) =0.\n\nExpand:\n\n(k\u00b2 + 368k + 184\u00b2) + 289 + a k + 184a + 272 =0.\n\nCompute constants:\n\n184\u00b2 =33856,\n\n33856 +289 =34145,\n\n34145 +272= 34417,\n\nThus,\n\nk\u00b2 +368k +33856 +289 +a k +184a +272 =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 + (368 +a)k + (33856 +289 +272) +184a =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 + (368 +a)k + (34417) +184a =0. Wait, let me check:\n\nWait, expanding step by step:\n\n(k +184)^2 is k\u00b2 +368k +184\u00b2,\n\nplus (-17)^2 is 289,\n\nplus a(k +184)=a k +184a,\n\nminus 16*(-17) is +272.\n\nSo total terms:\n\nk\u00b2 +368k +184\u00b2 +289 +a k +184a +272 =0\n\nCombine like terms:\n\nk\u00b2 + (368k +a k) + (184\u00b2 +289 +272) +184a =0.\n\n184\u00b2 is 33856,\n\n289 +272 =561,\n\nso constants: 33856 +561 = 34417,\n\nThus equation becomes:\n\nk\u00b2 + (368 +a)k + 34417 +184a =0 (Equation 2)\n\nAgain, from Equation1 (H's equation):\n\nk\u00b2 +a k +561 =0 \u21d2k\u00b2 = -a k -561.\n\nSubstitute into Equation2:\n\n(-a k -561) + (368 +a)k + 34417 +184a =0\n\nExpand:\n\n- a k -561 +368k +a k +34417 +184a =0\n\nThe -a k and +a k cancel,\n\nSo:\n\n368k -561 +34417 +184a =0\n\nCombine constants:\n\n-561 +34417 = 33856,\n\nSo,\n\n368k +33856 +184a =0\n\nSame as before! So 368k + 184a = -33856,\n\nFactor 184:\n\n184*(2k +a) = -33856,\n\nThus,\n\n2k +a = -33856/184 = -184,\n\nSame as previous case. So a = -184 -2k.\n\nPlugging back into Equation1 (for this case):\n\nk\u00b2 +a k +561 =0,\n\nSubstitute a:\n\nk\u00b2 + (-184 -2k)k +561 =0,\n\nExpand:\n\nk\u00b2 -184k -2k\u00b2 +561 =0,\n\nCombine terms:\n\n- k\u00b2 -184k +561=0 \u21d2k\u00b2 +184k -561=0.\n\nHmm, different quadratic equation now: k\u00b2 +184k -561=0.\n\nWait, so depending on whether the rectangle is above or below, we get different quadratics. Since the problem didn't specify the direction, but the four points must lie on a circle. Let me check which of these quadratics has real solutions.\n\nFirst case (rectangle above):\n\nEquation: k\u00b2 +184k -17=0,\n\nDiscriminant D= (184)^2 +68=33856 +68=33924,\n\nsqrt(33924)=?\n\nLet me compute 184.2^2: 184^2=33856, 0.2^2=0.04, 2*184*0.2=73.6,\n\nso (184 +0.2)^2=33856 +73.6 +0.04=33929.64, which is more than 33924.\n\nHmm, so sqrt(33924) is between 184 and 184.2. Since it's not a whole number, perhaps the problem requires an integer? Wait, but CE is |107 -k|, so if k is not an integer, CE might not be. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in assuming the direction.\n\nAlternatively, in the second case (rectangle below):\n\nEquation: k\u00b2 +184k -561=0,\n\nDiscriminant D= (184)^2 +4*561=33856 +2244= 36100,\n\nsqrt(36100)=190, which is a whole number!\n\nAh! So that's better. So in this case, sqrt(36100)=190,\n\nThus, k = [ -184 \u00b1190 ]/2\n\nSo two solutions:\n\nk = (-184 +190)/2 =6/2=3,\n\nor k=(-184 -190)/2=(-374)/2=-187.\n\nNow, we need to consider the positions. \n\nFirst, if k=3, then E is at (3,0). Since C is at (107,0), so CE would be 107-3=104.\n\nAlternatively, if k= -187, then E is at (-187,0). Then CE would be 107 - (-187)= 107 +187=294. But let's see if this makes sense.\n\nLet me check the rectangle positions.\n\nCase 1: k=3 (E is at (3,0)):\n\nThen rectangle EFGH is below the x-axis (since we considered the downward case). So F is at (3+184,0)= (187,0). Wait, but C is at (107,0). So the order on the x-axis would be D(0,0), E(3,0), C(107,0), F(187,0). So D,E,C,F are collinear in that order. That seems okay. The rectangle EFGH would extend downward from E(3,0) to F(187,0), then to G(187,-17), H(3,-17). Then points A(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), G(187,-17) lie on a circle. That seems possible.\n\nCase 2: k=-187 (E is at (-187,0)):\n\nThen F is at (-187 +184,0)= (-3,0). So on the x-axis, the order would be E(-187,0), D(0,0), C(107,0), F(-3,0). Wait, but F at (-3,0) is between D(0,0) and C(107,0)? No, since -3 is between -187 and 0, but not between D and C. Wait, actually the points would be ordered E(-187,0), D(0,0), F(-3,0), C(107,0). Wait, but F is at -3, so between D(0) and C(107)? No, -3 is left of D. So the collinear points would be E(-187), D(0), F(-3), C(107). That's not in order unless arranged differently. The problem states D,E,C,F are collinear but doesn't specify order. However, F would be between E and D in this case, but then C is after D. So the order could be E, D, F, C? But the problem says \"D,E,C,F are collinear\"\u2014maybe they are in the order D, E, C, F, but that would require E between D and C, and F after C, which is the first case. So perhaps the second case with k=-187 is not valid because F would not be after C. \n\nTherefore, k=3 is the valid solution. Thus, CE =107 -3=104.\n\nWait, but let me confirm with the circle. Let me check if the four points lie on a circle when k=3.\n\nCompute coordinates:\n\nA(0,16), D(0,0), H(3,-17), G(187,-17).\n\nWe can check if these lie on the same circle.\n\nFirst, let's find the circle equation. Let me use three points to find the equation and check the fourth.\n\nLet me use points A, D, H.\n\nPoints D(0,0), A(0,16), H(3,-17).\n\nLet me use general circle equation: x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 +ax +by +c =0.\n\nPlug D(0,0): 0 +0 +0 +0 +c=0 \u21d2c=0.\n\nPlug A(0,16): 0 +256 +0 +16b +0=0 \u21d216b = -256 \u21d2b= -16.\n\nPlug H(3,-17): 9 +289 +3a + (-17)(-16)=0 \u21d29 +289 +3a +272=0 \u21d2(9+289+272) +3a=0 \u21d2570 +3a=0 \u21d23a= -570 \u21d2a= -190.\n\nThus equation is x\u00b2 + y\u00b2 -190x -16y =0.\n\nNow check if G(187,-17) lies on this circle:\n\n187\u00b2 + (-17)^2 -190*187 -16*(-17).\n\nCompute each term:\n\n187\u00b2: 187*187. Let me compute 180\u00b2 + 2*180*7 +7\u00b2 = 32400 + 2520 +49= 32400+2520=34920 +49=34969.\n\n17\u00b2=289.\n\nSo 187\u00b2 + (-17)^2 =34969 +289=35258.\n\nNow, -190*187: Let's compute 190*187. 200*187=37400, minus 10*187=1870 \u21d237400-1870=35530. So -190*187= -35530.\n\n-16*(-17)=+272.\n\nThus total: 35258 -35530 +272 = (35258 +272) -35530 =35530 -35530=0. Perfect, so G is on the circle. Thus k=3 is valid.\n\nTherefore, CE is 107 -3=104.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the first case where the rectangle is above the x-axis, the quadratic had discriminant sqrt(33924) which isn't a whole number, leading to non-integer k, which would make CE a non-integer, but the problem probably expects an integer. So the correct scenario is the rectangle below the x-axis with k=3, leading to CE=104.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 104.\n\nWait, but let me just check once more to be sure.\n\nYes, the problem didn't specify the direction of the rectangle, but the key was that the four points lie on a circle. Since in the downward case, we got an integer solution, which makes CE an integer, which is likely the answer expected here. So I think the answer is 104.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{104}\n\n\nGiven rectangles \\(ABCD\\) and \\(EFGH\\) with \\(D, E, C, F\\) collinear and \\(A, D, H, G\\) on a circle, we need to find the length of \\(CE\\). \n\nWe start by assigning coordinates:\n- \\(D\\) is at \\((0, 0)\\)\n- \\(C\\) is at \\((107, 0)\\) (since \\(AB = CD = 107\\))\n- \\(A\\) is at \\((0, 16)\\) (since \\(AD = BC = 16\\))\n- \\(B\\) is at \\((107, 16)\\)\n\nFor rectangle \\(EFGH\\):\n- \\(E\\) is at \\((k, 0)\\)\n- \\(F\\) is at \\((k + 184, 0)\\) (since \\(EF = 184\\))\n- \\(G\\) is at \\((k + 184, -17)\\) and \\(H\\) is at \\((k, -17)\\) (assuming the rectangle is below the x-axis)\n\nThe points \\(A(0, 16)\\), \\(D(0, 0)\\), \\(H(k, -17)\\), and \\(G(k + 184, -17)\\) lie on a circle.
